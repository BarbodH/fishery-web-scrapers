394505,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-19 21:47:00,0,"Cram   ""My two cents -- the deep open water fish see <1% of the angling pressure (maybe less than 0.001%), are in colder water (helps them fatten up), and are eating much richer/fatter forage base than their shallow-water counterparts. If there's a new WR, and i would like to think there is, its coming from there.'    What is a deep open water fish?"
394519,cram,2009-10-19 22:26:00,1733," Those in open water feeding on herring/cisco.  Just a guess but i'd bet they're bigger -- better forage, colder water, and likely see WAY fewer lures trolling by than those muskies associated with shallow water structure eating pickerel and bass."

394549,MAzing,2009-10-19 23:45:00,43,"Ok a lot of what's been said makes a lot of sense.  Now what is stoping one of those 55 pounders from been caught just minutes after a meal lets say a couple of 5 pound whitfish or whatever swims in its waters. There have been fish under 55 inches and over 50 lbs caught and released.  Secondly let's say the norm for maximum girth is normally 1/2 the lenght but what about those rare fish like the Williamson fish which had a much bigger girth. What if that fish lived another 5 years and reached 56-57 inches in lenght?  Even a normal fish reaching the 60x30 mark would exceed the 65 lb mark.  We know the maximum growth rate for muskie is 54 in most places with maximum giths of 27 and just over 50 lbs, nothing is proven that there isn't a few freaks out there that will grow at least an extra 10% in lenght and girth or 59.5 x 29.7 or 65 lbs.  Also different areas offer different built fish, the Thousand Island fish like the Buffalo harbour fish seam to be georging in November and their girth is mostly in a small area and not through their lenght like the other big river fish or the GBay fish.  The McNair fish was released and may still be swimming out there, maybe it will be 60 x 3? the next time it hits a net and just maybe it will make it to a scale this time around.  Do I believe there are 70 pound fish out there, maybe maybe not but there sure are fish over 65 pounds out there, which is the true world record."

394677,Marc Thorpe,2009-10-20 10:13:00,621,"The intent and purpose of my post was not to give credibility or diss-credit any of the recent captures.  If anyone would like to discuss some of the recent captures on ANOTHER THREAD,I will gladly share my observations on the physical features of those captures and explain why those fish are of certain weights in my opinion and why they have attained maximum growth rate at the pinnacle of their evolutionary growth rate in their life.  Many of the explanation are within my post,The evolutionary growth in length and in girth were mathematically calculated and based on my observations throughout the years and considering many of the recent captures. Along with information on many of the fish that are un-known to be caught but were weighed with measurements taken. The numbers seem to indicate my beliefs the purpose of the post is to give folks some idea of the limitation and potentials that trully exist in the growth of muskies. Unlike humans,animals generally cease eating when they are full Digestion can take up to 3 days during summer months given the high metabolism and surrounding water temps and every 5 days or more during cold water periods. Feeding periods is generally an individualistic thing,they do not all feed at once and may not feed for days on end,maybe even weeks,weather does not trigger all fish to eat,but I suspect as they attained a certain size or age,they individually feed according to individual physical and metabolic needs.  Mutation or altered genetics generally do not occur naturally causing excessive growth but more so abnormalities in physical features of most animals: 3 toes,2 arms,stub arms,stub legs and so on  Gigantism is disease which affects growth hormones from functioning adequately,generally associated to humans and very few other mammals  Acceleration of growth rates generally leads to shorter life expectancy in most living animal  Utilization of air in the swim bladder is mostly used for laying on the bottom or laying on the bottom in fast current. I have witnessed on several occasions muskies coming up to the surface to take a Gulp of air and have witnessed and experienced air in-trapped in fish while fishing high current areas including the 1000 islands region.  The Williamson fish display the very specific characteristics and physical features I described.  Obrien fish like someone mention was a small guy and the picture we see,the fish head was cut so separating it from the body gives the allusion of a giant head. It was also take with a wide angles lens thus distorting the actual size of the subject. A great big fish  some of the recent captures that attained 60 inches,did not surpass 54 pounds or mid 50 pounds,some were harvested and weighed. The original measurement were inaccurate also Like I said,may of the great big fish captured in this decade may have had discrepancies in the methods of measuring the girth  Cram I suspect many of the fish using the st Lawrence do not go out to lake Ontario,I suspect they spend their summers in Chaumont Bay and Quinty, certain percentage of them leave the st Lawrence once spawning has been done to spend their summers these 2 large diverse habitat areas. The others from what I have read remain in the river as resident populations.  Most muskies come within proximity of structure and can be captured.Muskies are lazy by nature and will come withing close proximity to areas where they can be captured,they generally just don't hover in the water,simply because this physical effort consumes energy,most living matter on earth conserves energy for feeding and traveling/migratory  purposes.Most migratory fish tend to utilize allot of the energy that would allow for more fat retention and weight gain,thus migratory fish would generally show characteristics of being lean. each region posses varied densities  The purpose an intent is to give some understanding and potentials and limitations to the species  the main factors to retain are evolutionary growth periods and evolution life growth cycles and physical features and make up of the species from various regions  the secondary factor is whether the fish was girth ed In Water or Out of Water which in my observations has shown discrepancies in the accuracy of weight speculation for Out of Water measured fish. Fish girth ed in the water seem to display a closer proximity in weight to generally guest estimate calculations.  Tks for the comments and I am glad that this may be informative in the limitations and potentials regarding the species"
394693,bucktail,2009-10-20 12:05:00,1857,Good question Cram  I know a couple people that have had fish hit as they realed them in out by the Duck Islands in lake Ontario.

That fish was mounted by Larry Jones taxidermy, and if my memory is correct had two large whitefish in its belly, as Marc related this fish was truly a giant in regards to both its lenght but more importantly its girth, and also and maybe most importantly was its relatively young age at 17 years. The McNair fish and the Davison fish both fit this category as well, regarding lenght and girth, age of those two fish are uncertain as both were released, but from the pictures of both fish, they two might have not reached there maximum growth potential, as both fish by pictures were very healthy fish."

394286,Marc Thorpe,2009-10-19 10:11:00,621,"Allow me to explain my thoughts which have led me to believe there is a maximum potential. It is from observation,reading studies on cold blooded animals and fish in particular that have led me to from this opinion  I have spoken with DR Casselman about his maximum growth chart,even he admits it is a speculated calculated growth chart,there are many variables which are not factored. Like all species in which theoretical growth charts are calculate for.  We must understand that in most regions growth does not occur all season,it occurs during the months of June to September in length and October to December for girth,the retention and building of fat and egg development.These factors can be somewhat slowed or increased depending of yearly and seasonal water temps and weather conditions. Keep in mind fish do not gain weight during the course of the summer due to high metabolism in accordance average summer water temps. Un seasonal cool summers will allow the fish to retain a certain amount of weight but generally they stabilize in weight according to their physical features and make up which is somewhat below maximum girth grow potential. also given the cylindrical physical make up and feature of the fish a 55 inch fish would support IN WATER a girth slightly more than have its length which would equate to 27.5 inches in girth,yes there are the exceptions of 28 and possibly 29. Williamson s fish which supported a 31 inch girth measured laying flat and out of the water according to my information was above normal. Allow me to speculate that if the girth was taken in the water ,it would have supported a 29 inch girth which would placed it in the maximum norm. Some fish display great length but slender back ends,the heaviest fish seem to display uniformity from head to tail. The fish that display uniformity could be at maximum health period during their growth years/life while fish displaying great length but slender tail sections or back end may have exceeded or surpassed their maximum health and growth/ life period in their lives  We must also factor in angling pressure,many fish have shown signs of sulking and ceased feeding for a period after being angled and displayed avoidance afterward. I suspect that this experience of angling may impact a fish feeding behavior which would equate to lack of growth. From my observation on the Big O and Big Flo and many other regions of fish pictures I have observed,this is a important factor and determining factor which is an addition to all other variables which would allow for maximum growth  I do believe and from my observations and measuring from in water to out of water girth measurement there is a discrepancy of 1,5 to 3 inches from in water girth measurement to out of water girth measurements.I suspect many of the big girths we are seeing are out of water measurement.  This has led many to weigh there fish instead of girthing them,some do girth also their fish along with weighing them,its seems their weight and measurements seem to correlate with my thinking.  I seldom girth and do not weigh fish anymore,simply due to limiting my presence and pressure but most of all ,out of water and human contact to the fish One must stare the ennemy in the eye if he wishes minimize his impact on the fish  For one,we must break down each region which is producing great big fish and the physical make up and build of the fish.Each region shows variables in physical build and characteristics. There are many regions which posses and have produced great big fish of 50 pounds or mid to 58 pounds or so. Most if not all those fish were at peak growth and weight gain.  The question all ask is : The fish bite again,what says it wont eat more. My reasoning is : Did the fish eat the lure cause it was eating or did it hit the lure because it was invading its space of peace and tranquility. I do not believe fish hit lures because they are eating all the time,I suspect many times they hit lures simply because it disturbs them in there resting area, whether it be shallow or deep.  For those that fish above the norm,they will understand my next thinking. Ever notice you catch fish all summer them the fish somewhat disappear then show up gain and they are big! Maybe we are catching them when they are not eating! But catching them when they are being disturbed. I have observed the behavior of fish and its feeding tendency,I suspect a fish that hits a lure from the head or mid body is feeding but a fish that hits coming from behind,I suspect its hit from disturbing the fish.Many times those fish are slight hooked from the inside of the mouth but many times its from the outside in which would indicate an aggressive behavior towards the intruding lure.  We are living in the era of the best muskie fishing in history and the era of educated anglers,If there were 60 pounders,we would be catching them on a regular basis There are many of today's guides and anglers which specialize in great big fish,They are not catching them.  In all exclusion of the NFWHF  First lets understand that in most cold water regions 50 is attained generally between 18 to 24 years.Muskies are speculated to live until 30 years of age. When we factor that most living animals live out their lives to 80% of life expectancy,we can somewhat speculate that most muskies reach the pinnacle of there lives somewhere between 24 and 27 years old.Some do live out to 30 years old. They do not continue growth all there lives some just like all animals cease growth at 48,50,53 and the magical few will attain 58 inches or so. Most cold blooded animals seem to show lack of weight gain in the last year or 2 of there lives. Which would indicate that for a fish to be at its maximum potential the fish generally would be aged somewhere between 18 and 24 years of age.  Georgian bay has produced most probably the only 60 pounder ,speculation of Obrien's fish still abound but Williamson fish is un-disputably 61 pounds,It was aged at 17 years old ,which from all indication was a fast growth.Now to make clear the gonads were never verified to my understanding and information so the speculation that this fish was sterile is un-founded.  Georgian bay has produced many 50 pound to mid 50 pound muskies but like many regions it faces some environmental issues and the importance of all ,the diminishing of its forage base. The instability of weather which has direct effect on the feeding behavior of fish and most importantly the stability of water levels and temperature. Although it has produced many 50 pound fish,the length or maximum length do not seem to be common,fish in excess of 55 inches. I still believe that Georgian bay given its vastness could produce a fish slightly bigger than any other area. But not 70 pounds and I would be surprised at 65.  Green Bay posses the possibility of producing such a big fish also if the angling pressure does not override and cease the potential maximum growth rate. It has produced a few 50 pound fish but once again at its early stage in evolution, maximum length seems to be somewhat of a small minority of fish. It was also stocked some 20 years ago or so which many of the first generation of fish can and will attain maximum growth rate,the second and third generations seem to display a slower and lesser growth rate. What I have not quite understood yet about the Big Green is average water temps and growth rate speed,its seems from my understanding and information that the growth rate is accelerated which would indicate that these fish may not live to full expectancy but this is not yet understood  MN has produced some giant fish also,again 1st generation and fishing pressure seems to have created a form of avoidance in some areas.Once again the average maximum length seems to fall short somewhat.Although some giant are caught year to year,I do believe that methods of girthing maybe the variable that we are not looking at. The recent 58 incher and Jonenesi and Dahms fish are example of giants that do exist but once again we are looking at mid 50 pound fish which seem to display the peak of their life and physical being,The only variable which needs clarifying is whether girths were taken in water or out of water which would give a true approximation of their weight . Great big fish none the less  The Big O and the Big flo have displayed length but due to specific fishing pressure and current factors these fish display different physical features and make up. The Big O fish have had specific angling pressure which has led to avoidance and somewhat ceased weight gains during the fall months. I have personally observed 3 individual of 58 inches,2 of those were approx 45 to 47 pounds,I do not believe these 2 females posses the the physical make up of attaining 58 pounds or better,There is 1 female which her physical make up and characteristics does meet the needed make to attain possibly 58 pounds,Finding her during the prime maximum weight gain period is like looking for a needle in a hay stack.I suspect avoidance and possibly angling experience may hamper her feeding ability. We did capture her last year at 58x26 (in water girth measurement) (this fish was caught in august)last year due to unseasonably cool waters,the year previous she was 58x25 For all many I suspect angling pressure has affected there feeding ability or willingness. The barbosa fish after many discussion with Mike Lazarus the fish may have been 55 to 57 pounds and the Lapointe fish somewhere around 58 pounds(that fish is now dead from old age) The Big Flo has produced many big fish but the one thing many do not understand is the current things.Many fish that lay in current use there swim bladders to rest upon the bottom to allow themselves to lunge upwards to feed,These fish although show some very nice girth,most have air trapped in their swim bladders which leads to abnormal girths not supported by weight due to the dimension of the fish. Again the methods of girthing whether in water or out of water may lead to discrepancies in the girth of the fish. The Mcnair fish in my opinion is around 55 to 57 pounds and at its maximum growth period at the time of the season and her life,without factoring the trapped air in her swim bladder.  Lac Seul and LOTW and Nippising seem to show signs of similar issues as the Ottawa I must add that all these areas display common girth to length ratio which indicates healthy fish  When you factor all these regional variables and add environmental issues + weather + water conditions + angling pressure+ maximum life expectancy + maximum life period growth = limited possibilities of a fish exceeding 65 pounds or better  One of the most important factors is forage population which by all indications are in far lesser number than the 70's and 80's,many biologist speculate we will never see the abundance and populations we once had. This above all is a critical determining factor  C&R is great resource management tool and solutions but it is not the end all of end all, Post Mortality is a big factor and more an individual gets captured year after year or several times a years,Higher are the odds that post mortal release will ensue. I do believe state records can and will be broken if harvested I suspect we may have seen the biggest fish ever captured in Williamson fish There is a possibility that one slightly bigger may exist but unless harvested we will never know  In hopes this further clarifies some views on the matter,Although I am not a biologist,I am an enthusiast of the species and understanding its life evolution and behavior. At this point in my evolution of muskie fishing,its goes beyond the great big fish,its about the great big fish and how it evolves .  marc thorpe"

To get to 60 a high fat high protein diet such as herring is the key I think, combine that with the cooler waters of Geo Bay to maximize life span. Those freakish largemouth in California get big by feeding on stocked trout, another high fat high protein snack.  Hey maybe with the colder water temps that we have had over the last few years will open a window for more giant fish to show up."
394330,backbay,2009-10-19 14:22:00,773,"Thanks for sharing your experience and views, Marc. The resurgence of the Muskie fishery in the St. Lawrence and the Ottawa has been amazing. I'm from Hawkesbury: when I was younger, muskies out of that part of the Ottawa were almost unheard of, and now there are a good number of trophy fish in the area, as you know. I won't dare to speculate on the maximum potential size of the species; I'll let others with more studied opinions do that. What is heartening though, is the number of large fish being caught in a variety of different fisheries these days. As to which fishery hosts the possibility of the largest fish, I gotta go with Georgian Bay, but only because that's where I fish!"
394342,OhioFisherman,2009-10-19 14:42:00,6623,"Muskies a freshwater tiger, does it hit a lure out of hunger? or curiosity like a cat? playing with an unknown or for what seems like fun? Hunger for sure at times, the rest speculation?  Even and old dog or cat will play, check out the unknown in their space and muskies don`t have paws to do it with?  GB? some huge skis there, maybe not the numbers as in other areas but above average quality, LOL and they now have more trout available in their diet like the bass in California? Just a huge area with more than normal breeding grounds and feeding areas.  I think there is a train of though in bass fishing that a percentage of the outsized fish in a lake rarely approach a shoreline? Could be that way for skis also, deep water cruisers, shallow is for spawning only? Top of the food chain, everything else smaller is food.  Good article, just rambling."
394344,muskymatt,2009-10-19 14:51:00,2608,"I think it has been shown that several bodies of water are capable of producing fish in excess of 60 "" and if caught with the right feed bag on will have world record proportions.  The Ottawa river has produced the world record catch and release at 62"" as claimed by Bill Craig. And if that fish had attained a girth of 31"" it would (by calculations) weigh 66.20 lbs  I know of 3 confirmed 60"" plus out of the St.Lawrence and with the girth that they can achieve on the Larry it is not impossible to potentially see a fish of 61""x 32 with a weight approaching 70lbs  Or even a 60"" x 33""  and weigh over 70lbs  Dales fish at 57"" x 33"" clearly had more length potential and if able to once again attain a girth proportion of 33""  ....who knows how big it could get.  I also heard of a pike study done on Nippissing that involved netting and the MNR reportedly netted several muskies during that study that were approaching 63-65"" . These fish on a body of water such as the Nip. surley have record potential.  G.Bay has all the right ingredients for a W.R. fish but you just never hear anyone talk about it. Apparently (be it rumor or not) there was a Manitoulin area fish caught not recorded that weighed in excess of 70lbs. I cannot confirm though and supposedly it was years ago.  LOTM Lac St. Louis and St Pierre have proven also to have very large muskies and in good numbers as well. Once again you don't hear alot about them. So you can see several water bodies have had record fish potentials and those are only the fish we are seeing.  Genetics, body of water,food, yearly weather patterns and many other factors will play into the max size potential of Muskies. Ultimately you have to be in the right spot at the right time otherwise anglers(guides) such as Collin, Thorpe and Lazarus(and others) would catching record fish regularly instead of the likes of O'brien and Macnair. I believe that some muskies reach a certain size and then their habits change completely so we never see them again.  Is it not possible these monsters can become solely deep water dwellers??  But the debate will continue. And those with penis envy will find some way to discredit every fish and every person who caught it no matter what the proof and thus credible folks will keep it secret. The rest won't even bother to participate in the whole nonsense.  And the ugliness of ego will continue and prevail once again."

My two cents -- the deep open water fish see <1% of the angling pressure (maybe less than 0.001%), are in colder water (helps them fatten up), and are eating much richer/fatter forage base than their shallow-water counterparts.   If there's a new WR, and i would like to think there is, its coming from there.  I also strongly agree with Matt abour right place, right time.  There's a 44/45 inch musky that i mark all the time, sitting in the same spot in 30-40 feet of water in an area that sees VERY little angling pressure.  Despite throwing lures at that fish every chance i get (over 2 yrs) i have only caught it twice.... That fish eats once in awhile and otherwise, you're probably not going to catch it.  Muskies are not like Bass where you can (easily) inspire them to eat.  Maybe you can once in awhile, but you're hardly going to do that with open water fish (where there's no structure to focus on).....you need to be in the right place and right time.  I also think its unfair to judge the the MacNair fish (and others like it) based on the standard formula(s) because it has such a giant belly.   Its girth is HARDLY uniform.     It doesn't make his catch less extraordinary (it is MASSIVE).....just less appropriate for the weight formulas."

394447,cram,2009-10-19 19:36:00,1733," I have met Dale (he's not 300 lbs, or if he is he's hiding it well) and seen a replica of the fish.  Dale seemed like a great guy, and the replica was huge.  The fish was massive.  I didn't question  that, just said it (and others like it that have bowling ball bellies from the fall feed) probably don't fit the formulas for estimating weights.  That said, i didn't create the formulas so maybe that is taken into consideration.  Also, any WR fish is likely going to be in that class because its on the fall feed....so whatever the WR fish is, its likely going to have a bowling ball.  Its nothing that should discredit any fish....just the formula."
394457,backbay,2009-10-19 20:00:00,773,"Cram, that number came from the interview, if I recall correctly, that he did on another forum. I'd like to meet him, and see the replica firsthand...."

394498,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-10-19 21:38:00,0,"A very interesting read with some very good and true points, it is proven that 90 percent of all big fish over 50 pounds come in oct and nov, food source is a big reason for this and also roaming big muskies move closer to follow forage making those big fish more accessible to anglers, at a time when their weight mass is at or very close to its yearly peak, with both forage mass and egg mass. The next world record if someone decides to due the deed(kill the fish) will either come from GB or the Larry and not nessarily in that order. Nippising might be the wild card in the equation, all those bodies have the genetics and the forage base to produce giants."
