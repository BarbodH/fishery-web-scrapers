395727,justwannafish,2009-10-23 06:59:00,82,So tomorrow's forecast is rain all day but I'm determined to get as many days in fishing as I can. Does anyone have any advice as to where to (or not to) go in the hamilton and surrounding area? I have a car and am not opposed tro driving an hour but I don't have a boat. Any help is great help!! Thanks!! Josh

395800,Rizzo,2009-10-23 16:44:00,4754,can't help you with the shore fishing but I'm not going to let rain stop me either. I'll be out on the niagara river
395801,fishindude,2009-10-23 16:47:00,220,"I find that if it's light rain, the fishing actually improves! The rain stirs up the water and also distorts the light, drawing the fish to feed closer to the top. A good rain coat goes a long way in this situation. I will be fishing in the rain tomorrow from shore as well, good luck!  Tight lines, fishindude"
