He kept records, and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced.  This took a lot of time,  so he bought some tiny bells and attached them to his roosters. Each bell had a different tone,  so he could tell from a distance, which rooster was performing.  Now, he could sit on the porch And fill out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells. John's favourite rooster, old Butch,  was a very fine specimen, but this morning he noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all!  When he went to investigate, he saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets, hearing the roosters coming, could run for cover.  To John's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring.  He'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job and walk on to the next one.  John was so proud of old Butch,  he entered him in the Renfrew County Fair and he became an overnight sensation among the judges.  The result was the judges not only awarded old Butch the No Bell Piece Prize but they also awarded him the Pulletsurprise as well.  Clearly old Butch was a politician in the making. Who else but a politician could figure out how to win two of the most highly coveted awards on our planet by being the best at sneaking up on the populace and screwing them when they weren't paying attention.   Vote carefully next time, the bells are not always audible.  HH"
