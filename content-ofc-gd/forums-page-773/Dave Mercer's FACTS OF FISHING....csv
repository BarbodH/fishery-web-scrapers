Was looking at a few books to bring/purchase that I could read while relaxing on the beach and on the plane...  Anyway, to sum things up - I checked out AMAZON.CA and found out that Mr. Dave Mercer himself has a book out? Its called ""Dave Mercers Facts of Fishing""? Few questions... - Has anyone read this book? - Does anyone have this book? - What are your inputs on the book? (can't seem to find any related information on it on Google)  Here's the  LINK  on the book that I found on AMAZON.  I was also wondering if anyone else could suggest a good fishing related book that I could take along on the trip?  Thanks! A2F"

388635,tonyb,2009-09-30 19:39:00,1637," I've read that book, not too bad, takes you through the ups and downs of the tourny trail from his viewpoint.  How other experiences in life helped him with fishing and stuff, not a bad read.  I didn't really know much about him, so learning about his breakdancing in the boat was comical"
