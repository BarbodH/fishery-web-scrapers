With mine,I used 2-2x4,s for the runners.Nylon or old skis worked just fine as sliders.If they still sell them.strips of crazy carpet works aswell.Oh that was dateing myself.LOL As for the cover,I went with black.Attracks the heat,making it warm and less heat propane required at times. Also allow excess on the sides(flaps)to put the snow on to keep it more stable,flappy.   Now that you have my attention,I,ll be making another this year.Darn you anyways."
395495,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-22 19:16:00,2050,"  lol crazy carpets aren't that old school! I'm sure you can still get them - I had one when I was a kid...should've kept it! haha  Thanks for hte tips Misfish - if you stumble upon any higher res. photos let drop 'em on here. I'd like to see one of your huts up close!  Thanks again, Ryan"
395680,Jonny,2009-10-23 02:24:00,1380,"Did somebody say Krazy Karpet?  I built a 6 x 8 hut four years ago and used KK strips on the runners (wrapped around, screwed on, overlapped like fish scales) and they've lasted really well. The stuff is also super slippery and when water freezes against it, it can't stick.  There's a local store near me that sells KK's every winter. I've got a bunch stashed away for future use.  I'm thinking of building a more portable hut (like that rounded one above) --- if I don't end up with an ""Ice Cube"" instead. The disadvantage I see to the rounded design is that if I pull it behind my snow machine, I have nowhere to store all the gear (power auger, chairs, fishing gear, heater, etc.). That problem would be solved if two machines were going out together - one with the hut and one with a sleigh full of gear - but I'm usually out on my own.  The Ice Cube, on the other hand, would fit on top of the box full of gear on the sleigh. "
395779,Fisherman,2009-10-23 15:11:00,7201,"I think the solution to your single portable hut could be solved by adding permanent 1' high walls all around and then having the folding portion on top, still leaves enough room to put all your kit inside with the two ends foled down. The only extra weight would be the weight of 3/4 of a sheet of 3/8 or 1/2"" ply to make the walls."
395783,Jonny,2009-10-23 15:16:00,1380,"That's a good thought, thanks! Could be done."
395789,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-23 15:43:00,2050," Yeah I've even seen models online that have 12 or 20 inch sides which allow you to put a mernanent bench and all your gear inside, then fold the walls down on top.  I'd love to go that route, but I'll be lifting this onto the roof of my truck and pulling it by hand, so the less wood, and the lighter the better for me.  Cheers, Ryan"
395791,NAW,2009-10-23 15:53:00,4022,"I'm planning on building one of these this year.  I'm going to build a separate ""stand alone"" bench seat that will act as a storage box for my gear.  The box will be mounted to the collapsed hut while transporting.  Then moved inside, and used as a bench seat while fishing.  I need to think of a quick/easy way I can mount the box to the collapsed hut.  I donâ€™t want it to fall off while screaming across the ice at very high speed behind my 250 Bravo.."
395020,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-21 03:36:00,2050,"Hey guys,  I don't get out ice fishing much..... it's pretty much just a way to relieve the itch a little throughout the hard-water season....  Usually I just tough it out, but now that I've got kids, I'd like to put something together to keep them out of the wind, and in one spot!  I'm pretty handy, and have a few idea's of my own, but if anybody out there has suggestions, please post some pictures or ideas!  Thanks again OFC.  Cheers, Ryan    "

395023,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-21 03:48:00,10439,Ryan This guy has built the most innovative home made ice shelter I've seen.  Shanty Part 1  Shanty Part 2
395026,BassAsin,2009-10-21 04:16:00,806,do you mind flippin that same pm to me as well geoff i'm looking for any ideas to make a portable as well Matt!
395031,holdfast,2009-10-21 05:24:00,1813,"Seems the in thing around here is taking the insides out of an old small camping trailers , putting some sort of skies on them and cutting trap doors for the holes."
395036,Seeker,2009-10-21 05:33:00,7,"Look for a used tent at garage sales/close out sales etc.  Probably the cheapest and easiest way to go, especially if you don't get out much.   I can't believe hard water is just around the corner!"
395061,GBW,2009-10-21 12:33:00,8460,"Hey Matt, the funny thing is I sent Ryan to the same sight Drifter did, LOL!  So check those links.    BTW, if you want I can take a bunch of pic's of the clam 2000 when I get it so you can try and make one like it.  Let me know, cheers. Geoff"
395120,Jet,2009-10-21 15:43:00,364,This one looks alright.  http://www.iceshanty.com/ice_fishing/index...0950#msg1010950
395123,LeXXington,2009-10-21 15:58:00,1928,Guess the real issue is if your huffing it or going in style.  Clam's are nice for the kids cause they can ride on it as you huff it.   
395146,fisher,2009-10-21 17:44:00,451,"Rather than build something that is likely going to be bulky/heavy, do yourself a favour and get an Ice Cube (4-man size).  It's light (18 lbs I think) and easy to set up and take down.  Only about $200 on ebay.  I have been using one for 2 years now and I take my 6 year old with me all the time.  It heats up fast with just a Heater Buddy (I think that is what its called) and its pretty spacious too (can stand up straight in it)."
395150,LucG,2009-10-21 18:13:00,779,"I remember last year a couple guys tried seting up one of those tent type huts near our shack. Long story short, it wasnt a calm day and it seemed very difficult for them. After the whole thing went blowing down the lake, they gave up."
395159,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-21 18:40:00,2050," Thanks dude - much appreciated..   Drifter that thing is bad-ass, but to big, heavy and in the end costly for me.  I have to drag this thing by hand wit ha 3 year old sitting on top! lol and I figure by the time I build something like that I could have probably bought one.   Thanks Hold-fast.. a little to bulky for me.  I have to put this thing on the roof of my x-terra to get it around...   I actually was looking on Kijiji for one, but the more I look into it, the more I want a hard floor, and the option to tow it around without having to tear down and re-build down the lake..   very cool - if I was going alone all the time I'd probably go with that design for sure!   I'm hoofin' it alright! no sled or quad over here.... cute kids man!! - nice to see you gettin' them out on the ice!   Thanks for the tip - but the reason I'm looking to build one is that I don't want to spend much money on this.... $200.00 buys a heck of a lot of softwater baits! haha   yeah man, I was out last year BBR of OFC, and we froze our tails off trying to set up a tent-type shelter, with bars everhwere, which had no floor and my feet got wet inside....... I swore to myself that day that I'd never buy a tent-style hut."
395163,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-21 18:47:00,2050,This could be a winner....anybody ever use / build something like this?     
395164,GBW,2009-10-21 19:10:00,8460,buy some old snow skis if you make that one to help you pull it...
395166,Lostchild,2009-10-21 19:33:00,153,This may help you with plans to build one like in your last post Urban...  ice hut plans
395177,johnnyb,2009-10-21 20:09:00,3413,  Pretty sure one of those was for sale on the classifieds board a few weeks ago...also if you look for the DeWalt Ice Hut Plans...you should find the setup for that one.
395179,camillj,2009-10-21 20:14:00,1988,"  Honest to goodness .. you simply  cannot beat the 4 man ice cube .. it's light, goes up and down in a flash and does NOT blow around in the wind ... and for about $200 you arent gonna build anything that works for much less ... I carry it out over my shoulder so it doesnt take up room for other stuff on the sled .... I walk out btw ..."
395181,NAW,2009-10-21 20:18:00,4022,Do you need to register one of those fold out homemade huts?  I see them a lot on Simcoe.  But never noticed numbers on them..
395182,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-21 20:18:00,2050, wicked - those plans are great! thanks
395189,jedimaster,2009-10-21 20:58:00,3472,"I had one of those homemade ones you posted and it was fine. but it was a carp you pull out through the snow. Honestly for the cost of the plywood and a sheet or tarp, your better off spending like 50 more bucks and getting a cube. I have one now and will never go back. I also had a Guide and I much prefer the cube. It sets up fast and is way lighter than anything home made."
395191,misfish,2009-10-21 21:03:00,29133,Spiel and crappiesteve made those huts famous.LOL    Easy to build and pull. I have built a number of them then just gave them away.
395195,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-21 21:30:00,2050," I know what you guys mean, but I've got all the materials needed to make something like that.  I've spent the past 2 years renovating my house so my total cost for a project like that will be roughly $0.00"
395198,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-21 21:45:00,10439,You could whip up a temporary one like this guy in town here does every winter.  
395199,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-21 21:46:00,2050, awesome - what were the dimentions of that one in the picture?  The plans I have here are to make one that's 4'x7'.  I  think I might want mine to be a little smaller that that though...  Thanks!
395217,danbouck,2009-10-21 23:02:00,4380, I am about to make one like this for the small lakes.  I will also be making a big one to leave out on the bay. I'll let you know where it is and you can use it whenever you want.
