I was down 2 weeks ago and there were some fish in the creek above the sanctuary. This past monday I went down to check it out and saw but 2 fish. No corpes in the creek, so have they run already?"
395943,Bart_ca,2009-10-24 02:20:00,1,"In my opinion most fish have move up, but with this rain we should get few more fish in the lower part of the creek followed by some steel."

395960,fishinguypat,2009-10-24 04:26:00,547,you guys crack me up...lets just say almost all of the salmon that were suppost to run are like 25 km or more from the harbour...there was a huge run of them sept 20 and a few weeks after that

396000,tributaryhunter,2009-10-24 16:18:00,108,"some more will move in to the lower stretchs, same with browns, cohos and steelies, there hasn't been any huge runs in bronte the last couple of years, this year  as soon as the creek came up you basically had to be there to hit the run comming through, pretty pethedic if u ask me oh well not much u can do, a couple people that live down there gave me the details on the runs this year as in not very good cheers"
