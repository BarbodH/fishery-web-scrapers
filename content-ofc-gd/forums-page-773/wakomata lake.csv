394918,TDunn,2009-10-20 23:40:00,680,I have only fished lake trout at wakomata.....Never seen or heard of walleye but there is pike and smallies.    TDunn
394948,pike slayer,2009-10-21 01:18:00,1177,ya i never heard of walleye there either.....
394958,Dara,2009-10-21 01:42:00,3052,Not a lot of walleye in 220' of water
394959,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-21 01:45:00,0,apparently it has walleye!  i've only heard of people fishing smallies and lakers as well though.  http://www.wakomata.com/fishing.html

395069,Dara,2009-10-21 12:48:00,3052," I can't see where it says there are walleye, it just states the season...am I missing something?"
395094,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-21 14:29:00,0,i believe it is lists the species in wakomata along with their seasons.  that's how i read the paragraph anyways. often cottagers aren't too eager to disclose their lake having walleye due to how highly prized they are.
