395283,MuskyHurricane,2009-10-22 02:07:00,6,"My good friend took this week off work to fish musky on the Larry, He is known as the ""KINGPIN"" of our home waters.  I have been fishing in the area for a few years and boating some nice fish on large profile lures. We thought that the week was going to be the POUNDER vs THE TUBE.(both of our confidence baits)  Well so far we have put one 48"" in the boat that came on a small little muskyhuslter tipped with a money minnow.  We keep missing fish that appear to be bitting very, very lightly at the head of the lure.  Skunked three days out of four has been tuff to swallow.(especially fishing ten hours a day).  Anybody familliar with the Larry bite that can give us any input as to what can turn these fish into real eaters rather then nippers. We mainly cast but are set up for the troll too!  Here is a pic of musky available on the cast in the Larry!"
395287,mistaredone,2009-10-22 02:11:00,913,Nice fish!!!  What a pig!
395289,backbay,2009-10-22 02:22:00,773,"I'm not familiar with the Larry at all MH, but I'm interested that the tube has worked for you. I know some guys love 'em, but I don't know many that would call them their go-to bait. I guess the proof is in the pudding, given the size of that beast."
395296,MuskyHurricane,2009-10-22 02:40:00,6,"Every water is different but for our specific system the tube is #1, go to redoctoberbaits.com.  That fish ate a pounder but I can tell you many nice ones have fallen to the Red October tube,"
395313,Roy,2009-10-22 03:06:00,13728,Nice fish. Are you out of New York?
395318,fishindude,2009-10-22 03:15:00,220,"Wow that fish is a gator! What an awesome fishery the Larry must be, gotta get out there sometime!  Tight lines!"
395330,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-22 04:00:00,0,great fish.....have you any more pictures? Everyone loves that fish porn. Sorry to hear about your luck. Being skunked isnt fun....: Reminds me of a fish that a guy named Dadson caught. Same pose..........    
395342,Joey,2009-10-22 04:55:00,9122, Dadson looks a little chilled
395357,MuskyHurricane,2009-10-22 11:30:00,6,"No, not New York we fish out of Canada!"
395361,Roy,2009-10-22 11:56:00,13728," Ok, I was just going by your T-shirt. Very nice fish though."
395489,fester361,2009-10-22 18:55:00,1,Nice Fish MH. Thats a lot of hours casting on the st lawrence for a fish that nice. i fish on the new york side from clayton to massena. If your in an area where your confident  fish  are there then casting is a blast and probably the funnest way to hook up. Unfortunately that is far  and few between for this guy and trolling structure is my best bet. Depth Raiders swim whizz and other hard body baits are what works best for us but a good bulldawg thrown in the right place has also done very well. What town or village is nearby where you fish on the larry this will give me a better understanding of your water. The best time of the year on the larry is almost upon us so keep at it and another slob may appear on your line! have fun!
395524,Rizzo,2009-10-22 21:13:00,4754,"hey joey, got any photos of yourself doing a dadson hold?"
395573,MuskyHurricane,2009-10-22 23:28:00,6,"We are fishing close to the massena area. But we can go all the way to St Francis when we need to.   This weeks bite is totally off not even a follow, it's almost like they are nipping the lure cause we are getting in their comfort zone. Thats our theory cause one could assume if they were following it would show interest.  Fester,You say the bite should go off soon, in the past when have you experienced aggressive feeding patterns?"
395586,Roy,2009-10-22 23:51:00,13728,"Maybe you should try the Red October tube? But what the heck, I'll take a guess. Run a stalker type bait (9+ inches), perch pattern, in 15-20 FOW at slower than summer speeds....maybe 3mph. Use down rods and keep the bait spotless. Lock the reel down and watch the sonar when you can. Don't drag it more than 15-20' from the prop wash.  ps. Make sure that your net and release tools are in top shape.  I really want to see how this works out so give us a report....please."
395613,Lungelarry,2009-10-23 00:31:00,294,"First off October is transition time,less muskies doing the same thing at the same time, coupled with big northeast winds for the last 2 weeks, resulting in rapid falling water temps....fishing is going to be super slow. Fish your best spots,(places you have caught fish)camp on these areas,fish slow and wait for windows of oppotunities(wind shifts, cloud cover on sunny day.sun out on cloudy day , the last hour before sunset, and fish your best spot on the majors and minors)Good luck"
395619,Roy,2009-10-23 00:38:00,13728,"Some of the best advice I've heard, Larry. Good on ya."
395635,MuskyHurricane,2009-10-23 01:01:00,6,"  I was able to put two 42""& 44""(little tanks spuing terds all over the deck) in the boat last week doing this exact tactic, but I was alone. this week we tried to find an active fish kinda checking multiple spots, once we realized what type of bite we had we cut down to about four spots a day. We have had windows but the bite is so so light it's incredible. The one thing that really has me thinking is no follows at alll eihter they nip it or nothing.  Thanks for the info it's good to see we are not far off.  I happen to have a red stalker that I will troll tommorow, just to try Roy suggestion!"
