394609,jjcanoe,2009-10-20 02:20:00,744,"With Slowpokes boat still under the knife, he talked me into bringing my boat down to Jeanettes creek to do some trolling for Muskies in the Thames.  Arrived at his house at the crack of 6am and loaded up the truck hit the Timmies on the way out of town.  We made it to the river just after daybreak.  It was a slow morning and the first one we saw was being hauled in backwards (tail snagged). A few hours and a few lure changes later we started to see the odd one coming to the net on other boats, but not mine!  Finally Slowpoke gets one on and after less than a minute it spits the hook. D'OH! About an hour later we decide to call it a day but figure on doing one more lap and then back to the launch... Slowpoke says he has a good feeling about this last lap......not even 2 minutes later WHAM!  Fish on! A solid fight and a quick net job and we have a nice fish in the Giant Trawling Net Slowpoke brought... so here we have a 44"" fish who is not quite played out.  Now we need a quick pic.   Slowpoke has his OFC 2009 Sign in his mouth and lifts the fish out of the net,  the sign is blowing up across his face so it can't be read and I pause for just a second before snapping the pic......Remember when I said that the fish was probably not quite ready to be in the net?  Well I guess it remembered also so it does a quick flop out of Slowpokes left hand and goes head first into the water with Slowpokes right hand still latched on to the tail.(but not for long)  The pic I got looks like a classic release pic but was kind of comical to see it in person.  We decided to make a few more laps after that but no more luck!  Now here's the fish porn! Loaded up with gear and ready for action!   What was behind that tree?   Finally one in the net! Lure of choice 10"" Jake   Classic ""release"" pose "

394663,SlowPoke,2009-10-20 08:45:00,2984," Thanks again JJ, it would have been a good trip even without getting one in the boat. Let me know when you're ready to do it again."
394665,Spiel,2009-10-20 08:47:00,9065,And here I thought with a name like Slowpoke the fish would have been belly up by the time it was boatside.
394668,SlowPoke,2009-10-20 09:04:00,2984," LOL! Gotta work fast in rush hour Thames traffic. You take too long to land a fish, you get clothes-lined by by someone's planerboard line!"
394695,Joey,2009-10-20 12:12:00,9122,"Nice ski and nice action shot  Gotta love those ""last cast"" fish eh!!  Joey"
394774,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-20 16:37:00,0,It happens! At least you know the fish swam away nice and healthy.lol Thanks for sharing.
394775,Twocoda,2009-10-20 16:47:00,4130,All the years i lived in London and i never ever caught a ski in the thames ( everything else though) including an escaped squirrel monkey from storybook gardens...still no improvements to the boat launch i see ...good on ya for the catch ...
395286,jjcanoe,2009-10-22 02:10:00,744,not much up in the London area as far as muskies but more down by the Lake St. Clair end  jjcanoe
395479,ccmtcanada,2009-10-22 18:24:00,7971,You sure that's a muskie?  Cant really tell from those pictures....LOL.  Great job guys!
395491,SlowPoke,2009-10-22 19:03:00,2984, You'd recognize it if it was in a more familier setting; like at the other end of the boat and Carole holding it.
395493,Roy,2009-10-22 19:09:00,13728, HAHAHA There's something to be said for having a super bright team captain.
395497,ccmtcanada,2009-10-22 19:24:00,7971,   This is my point...this is the angle I see muskie at...and I still cant tell....
