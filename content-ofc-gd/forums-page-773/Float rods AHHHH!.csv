394746,Steel28,2009-10-20 14:15:00,160,I used D-back for some fresh chinnies and was able to turn and land them pretty successfully. I've fished same rivers with Frontier MX and D-back feels so much crispier. IMO.
394755,justin elia,2009-10-20 14:41:00,151," Credit, Bronte would be considered medium sized rivers, Niagara/Saugeen would be considered big water."
394762,solopaddler,2009-10-20 15:30:00,8605,"  Yeah I know, I know. George and Tom say a lot of things to a lot of people. There's only one 13/6 D-back though.. They are however rated differently in the U.S. I bought both the Sage and D-back blanks straight from Tom."
394776,MJL,2009-10-20 16:48:00,2427, Say it ain’t so…Maybe you got the dud blank built on a Monday and Steel28 and I got the ones built on Wednesday  Check your PM box Mike
394785,steelhead197,2009-10-20 17:06:00,38,"Just recieved a G Loomis GLX 1562 13 foot float rod, on warranty........Had the rod for 15 minutes and traded it for a 3 piece Loomis GL3 13'6(amazing rod).....What a piece of junk(GLX)!!(in my opinion) Talk about a wet noodle!! Just goes to show, price tag doesn't mean everything! (GLX $690 with taxes!!) In my opinion stay away from Streamside, they cant make a pair of wading boots that hold up to vigorous fishing....A couple of my friends bought them(Streamside float rods) because they liked the price point, and were not happy with action and or strength! Watch the classifieds and you will find a good deal on something to start with!! Would not recommend spending too much $ on your first 13 footer, you may perfer the shorter rods? My 2 cents!!"
394818,BillM,2009-10-20 18:51:00,17367,"  Funny you mention that..  I was out fishing with a buddy last week and he ended up snapping his Rainshadow XST in 2 places (obviously a defect)..  His backup was a GLX...  Wet noodle was right, he couldn't move fish after that.....  I also run a 13'6 GL3, wouldn't trade it for the world."
394839,highdrifter,2009-10-20 20:18:00,2534," Bill, would that be the GL3 1622 blank??!  Cause if it is, I'd want to be buried with it too!!"
394845,BillM,2009-10-20 20:36:00,17367,"Fidel, that would be the one..   I also picked up a Loomis IM6 3pc 13', that one is going with me to!"
394893,charlied,2009-10-20 22:52:00,584,I could possibly be selling my Loomis GL3 for around a $120-140 soon!
394923,highdrifter,2009-10-20 23:58:00,2534," You must keep your rod rack beside your bed stand...  I know..  It helps me sleep soundly too.  Real shame Loomis won't be selling blanks anymore.  I heard a rumor though, or perhaps I dreamt it that Garry will get back into the biz..  Garry if you're reading this, you have the power!!  HD"
394924,highdrifter,2009-10-20 23:58:00,2534, float rod??
394926,fishinguypat,2009-10-21 00:09:00,547,go get a solid 8-11 footer none of this 15 foot bull
394928,MJL,2009-10-21 00:15:00,2427," Hey Fidel  Gary is back in the biz.  For now it looks like 11'6"" is the longest salmon/steelhead blank in his lineup  http://www.northforkcomposites.com/nfc_catalogv1.04.pdf"
394934,highdrifter,2009-10-21 00:31:00,2534, How did you do that??!
394936,jdmls,2009-10-21 00:36:00,575,"  LMAO, Shimano took you for a run sending you the 2 power as a replacement. The 2 power I agree is best described as a wet noodle, but has its place in the lineup ... The 3 power is GOD's gift    ..Ya you can get picky about the 11 Recoil guides or the fact that it has no hook keeper, but as far as a factory rod with lifetime warranty nothing touches the 3 power GLX .... FYI I am not here to argue with any of you IMX4LIFE gentleman, just clarifying that the 2 power is what it is (wet noodle) and not to get it confused with the totally different 3 Power GLX which is worth every penny ... As for the 1601 hmmmm ,ok I will leave that one for the other board"
394949,dave524,2009-10-21 01:20:00,4508," Looking at the specs the 11'6"" rods appear to be true noodles, probably similar to the Fenwick HMG 1441's of the early 80's, The IGFA 2 and 4 notation implies that is the pound test they are designed for. Not at all what we want for a float rod , even for oldschoolers like me who cherish old Loomis IM6 1562's. Have to watch for further models I fear."
394964,charlied,2009-10-21 01:52:00,584,"yes, its either a 12.5 or 13 footer."
394972,BillM,2009-10-21 02:04:00,17367," You mind as well skip steelhead fishing and head right to the pond for bluegill...  15ft foot rods have their place, and I wouldn't run anything shorter then 13' for anything else.  8ft?  lol"
394978,charlied,2009-10-21 02:08:00,584,The big rods really help fight a fish in the currents of a larger river like the Niagara.
394983,buckster,2009-10-21 02:19:00,530,  Nooo Not Tom lol
395066,kemper,2009-10-21 12:41:00,2232,"  You wouldn't go shorter than 13' Bill?  I agree that the long stick DEFINITELY has its place, but I also think the short stick does as well.... I have a 10'6"" and an 11'6"" that are a complete blast to fish in smaller flows...of course I wouldnt whip them out on the Niagara but for droppies on the smaller east tribs I love the 11'6"""
395154,dave524,2009-10-21 18:27:00,4508,"I throw a float reel on a 9'6"" extension butt fly rod for one Erie trib, a 15 footer would touch the other side in some places."
395399,BillM,2009-10-22 14:16:00,17367, Even in the small ditches out east I don't think I'd bring anything less then my 13.6'...  I guess it's all personal preference though.
395402,troutologist,2009-10-22 14:28:00,951,"I sold an 11'6 to a buddy and wish I would have kept it. Trying to bushcrash and cast in very tight quarters was much easier with that rod. But overall I found many more things that a longer rod does to make fishing easier.  Tell me if theres anything more frustrating than negotiating through alder tangles and thick brush to get to a sweet looking spot with no access, getting all set up to make that perfect cast, then having a branch catch your line behind or above you as you attempt to cast out."
395421,craigdritchie,2009-10-22 15:17:00,1586,"I have an ancient nine-foot HMG I sometimes use in small, brush-filled ditches - sometimes for steelies, sometimes for resident browns. I prefer longer rods, so this one definitely feels weird after fishing bigger waters with a 13+, but in the little creeks it works absolutely great. It's a different kind of fun."
394537,danjang,2009-10-19 23:21:00,148,"I'm currently looking for a float rod no more than 200$ and I would like people's opinions. I am currently using a spinning 9'6 HMX from fenwick. I would like something around 13' but there are so many manufacturers to choose from. The rod I was really looking into at first was the Okuma Aventa rods. Probably the cheapest I can find and might compliment my Sheffield pin very well but I have heard some bad things about it. Just looking for a decent entry level float rod with a good warranty (lifetime if possible!). Also, why are the G Loomis rods insanely more expensive than the other manufactures? Are they the Lambos of the fishing world? lol"
394546,drwxr,2009-10-19 23:40:00,453,"six rivers by browning at bps $120, was at sale 2 weeks ago for $80."
394547,kemper,2009-10-19 23:41:00,2232,"Avoid the aventa....at all costs.  Look in the classifieds here or on floatfishing . net and you can find some REALLY sweet deals. That said I have a Raven IM6, and I love it. Many bash it to death and say you break one every three minutes but only loogans break rods like that"
394551,BillM,2009-10-19 23:48:00,17367,"It's impossible to break the Raven IM6.  That thing is a wet noodle!!!  It would never snap, lol  You should be able to find a decent deal on a used rod for under $200..."
394552,silvio,2009-10-19 23:49:00,433,guess I am a loogan
394553,steelhead hunter,2009-10-19 23:50:00,152,St croix wild river you can get a 13' for 180 and it's as tuff as they come

394560,JPD,2009-10-20 00:13:00,296,"The Shimano Clarus 13' has a lifetime warranty for under $200 and is probably the only one. You must realize that the rod will be heavier than a $600 GLX Loomis but hey, for an entry level rod with lifetime warranty you can't go wrong! Lots of back bone with this rod as well not like the old Canadian Northern Series that used to start bending at the cork!  JP"
394562,troutologist,2009-10-20 00:27:00,951,"The Raven IM8 is about my favourite rod for moderate cost. 200 or slightly over.  Im a big fan of this rod, if you fish big flows it might lack the heavy duty backbone.   As an aside, Ive got a CTS 13'6 and it is the bee's knee's for heavy water."
394568,tibbs,2009-10-20 00:38:00,650,I have a Raven IM8 too. I think its a great rod. You can get the 13' with sliding rings for $199.99
394596,salmon,2009-10-20 01:39:00,334, Danjang Check you PM
394613,kemper,2009-10-20 02:31:00,2232,"I happen to like my wet noodle, I built a sweet st. croix last year and for some reason I still always reach for the IM6. I need to stop doing that and get some action on the custom stick.  Sil I made the loogan comment because I knew you'd be all over that one just kiddin bud."
394624,krawler,2009-10-20 02:51:00,167,"Quantum Coldwater, 5 years, same rod, no problems, tons of fish!"
394627,aniceguy,2009-10-20 03:03:00,1094,Avoid the okuma's of the world......good advise here St croix has a nice avid coming out worth looking at. Fast blank with lots of back bone a noodle that bends to the cork or something in between lots to choose from My IMX is always for sale...but a bit over your budget. Im waiting to see the newest CTS with a buddy so I can give er a whirl...   Seriously danjang buy what you can afford after all its not the rod that hooks the chromer and breaking a 200 stick is far less disheartening then breaking a 700 one...trust me there
394633,KelfuN,2009-10-20 03:19:00,246,"been using the raven im8 for 2 seasons now..its a solid rod for the price, cant go wrong..  the shimano clarus is also a sweet deal. i think it was on sale at bronte outdoors a while ago for $80?  wait for the new avid series or the new raven rv9...both are going to be sweet rods"
394637,highdrifter,2009-10-20 03:24:00,2534," I'm told that stick is lighter and crisper than the sage SCII 1136-3, and it won't blow the bank...  but what do you expect from 20 year old technology...  Tom at AS quoted me $920 for a finished custom stick..  Can you freaking believe that??!  Solo has good things to say about CTS too...  Hopefully, this helps me make up my mind.  Looks like Christmas is coming early this year!!"
394640,troutologist,2009-10-20 03:40:00,951,"That CTS is unreal....for the power it has its very light.  It is as stong as my 15' IM9 and so much easier to fish all day with.   Wish I had it on the manistee last fall, IM8 didnt have enough backbone to move those fish. Theres a video on here somewhere that Mike took, thought I was gonna break the rod."
394644,MJL,2009-10-20 03:52:00,2427,"Hard to go wrong with a Raven IM8.  A great performing rod at a pretty good price ($200-$250 depending on whether you get sliding rings or a reel seat).  As others have said, the Aventa might not be the right rod for you.  It has a slow/sloppy feeling more akin to rods of the 80's and early 90's which were designed to handle ultra-lite leaders and mainlines.  Definitely better rods out there to choose from for this day and age.   Hey Fidel  Most blanks nowadays are lighter and crisper than the GSH 1136-3.LOL  That blank was developed back in the early 90's and is based on the old RP taper.  It's a beautiful rod nonetheless with a pretty sweet action.  If you like the feel of the Sage, play around with the 13'6"" Diamondback that Tom had custom made for him (It's a private label blank).  It still has the same moderate/parabolic action but it's lighter, less tip heavy with a crisper action than the Sage - Only thing is I'm not sure what the warranty is like.  I absolutely love mine."
394687,NAC,2009-10-20 11:50:00,369,"  good advice for the $$.  I bought a 13' Shimano Convergence as a backup when the old GL2 isn't limber enough.  It is the entry level for Shimano's lifetime warranty rods, at just under $100.  A definite workhorse but also it can be a little too heavy and rigid for my liking.  Good investment until you figure out what you really want."
394719,Steel28,2009-10-20 13:02:00,160," Fidel, I got 13'6 Diamondback and 13' Loomis IMX and honestly switch between two all the time    Next one is 15' GLX for the big water   As for the OP, find used rod like Raven IM8 or new Quantum Coldwater or Shimano Converge. Good luck."
394730,solopaddler,2009-10-20 13:24:00,8605," You're right the 13'6 CTS is sweet. Just to clarify though for Fidels benefit I believe you had the first generation CTS built (forest green blank). John came out with a new one mid August this year that's even lighter and still has tons of power...    Have you called J.C. yet? You should.     Yeah that was an epic battle dude.   Pretty much any rod is gonna take a beating though when you're forced to fight a 12lb chromer from an anchored boat.    Agreed the Raven IM8 is a very decent stick for the money, but it's definitely not a big water rod. Under a full load it'll bend right into the butt. Head and shoulders above the Raven IM6 though..  Also I completely 100% disagree with your comment on the Diamondback. I've owned and fished both the Sage and the D-back and there's no comparison. The Sage has waaay more power and is waaay crisper than the Diamondback. The Diamonback is an old school soft rod, mushy to the max."
394733,justin elia,2009-10-20 13:28:00,151,"Danjang, When I first started steelheading, I used a Fenwick HMX 12'6"" rated 4-10.  Its got good back bone, fast taper, not too heavy and lasted a while before it broke, due to my own fault.  It should still have stainless guides, and the diameter of the top guides are larger than avg., making for less ice blockage in cold weather.  It should retail for around $125.  You may want to look at used rods as well."
394735,MJL,2009-10-20 13:41:00,2427," Mike which model Diamondback did you use?  Did it say ""Diamondback by Angling Specialties"" on the blank?  The time I built my first ever Diamondback float rod, I shot an e-mail to Diamondback about the history of this blank and it was determined that there are 2-3 different (maybe more) 13'6"" models (all 3 piece but colours range from a light brown to red (which is the one I have).  The line rating on mine is 4-10lb while I have seen others rated at 4-8lb and 6-8lb.  According to George at the Scarborough AngSpec store, the Diamondback float rod blanks that they sell were based on the GSH 1136-3 taper as they were unsure whether or not Sage would continue to build that particular blank for them in the future."
394741,danjang,2009-10-20 14:04:00,148,Thanks for everyone's input. I have some shopping around to do. What's considered to be big water? I fish most rivers between Bronte to the Ganny and occasionally Niagara. Niagara is definatly big water but would the credit also be?
394744,Jet,2009-10-20 14:12:00,364,"The first good decision you made is having a budget. Lots of good rod choices mentioned here and as you said you got some shopping to do. Go hit up BPS to check out the rods in your price range, then go to Ang Spec to see Tom about 15 mins away. He's got some good rods in your price, particularly from Streamside. Until you go out and hold and feel the rods, everything is going to feel like a possibility - including the very expensive ones!"
