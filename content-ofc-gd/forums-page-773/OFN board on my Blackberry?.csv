395260,splashhopper,2009-10-22 01:19:00,2931,I would love to be able to use this board when I am fishing on the weekends( PM's  etc) but find it very cumbersome on my Blackberry.  Is there a mobile version of this board?  Thanks

395401,The Urban Fisherman,2009-10-22 14:22:00,2050," I post on my blackberry (pearl) all the time.... actually OFC is one of the few sites that actually works on my blackberry.  Everything looks   - backwards but once you get used to it, it's not a problem.  Looking forward to the new ""app"" Rick.  Cheers, Ryan"

395494,SlowPoke,2009-10-22 19:10:00,2984, I've always had good luck watching out for the car in front of the one behind me.   I post and read on my BB in regular mode but I find the LoFi loads lightning fast. I hope the new update can wrap it all up in one package.
395530,pike slayer,2009-10-22 21:33:00,1177,download opera mini! its like a wayyyy better internet explore type thing for your blackberry its free and much better then the one already on the phone. ive gone on here on my blackberry and have posted and sent pms.
395533,bigfish1965,2009-10-22 21:51:00,3382, The new version is having its mobile skin re-done as we speak. It is being touched up to be more friendly to touch screen phones. This is why we never grab major updates when they first come out. Let other people work the bugs out first The new lofi/mobile version will have everything you need in one place.
