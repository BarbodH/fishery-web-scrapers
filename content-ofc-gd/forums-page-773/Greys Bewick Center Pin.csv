One that has caught my eye so far is the Greys Bewick,  it's a 4.25 and weighs 7oz, price is about $200.  It also has a life time warranty.   Others I've noticed lack this option,  Vectras have a 5yr and all others I've looked at only say 1yr.  Anyone happen to have any knowledge or experience with these pins??   Thanks!"

I've been having a hard time finding reviews and info about it myself.  You may have better luck getting info on British match fishing forums or British carp fishing forums about this reel.  A quick google search should come up with many."

395742,craigdritchie,2009-10-23 11:16:00,1586,"You can read a review of it here: Greys Berwick Review  The Berwick is a nice reel, but I wouldn't get too hung up on the lifetime warranty. There isn't a whole lot to a centrepin to begin with, and even less that would be covered under a warranty repair anyway. Warranty won't cover bearings wearing out or damage from dropping it ... there isn't much else to go wrong.  Unless you fish mainly small creeks, you might consider a slightly larger reel in the 4-1/2 inch range. The extra diameter doesn't add much weight, yet it greatly increases line pickup, which can be a big plus if you fish medium-large rivers."
