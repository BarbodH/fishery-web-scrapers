395893,Burtess,2009-10-23 23:09:00,901," I have no problem with anyone keeping their legal limit, as long as they will consume their catch, which you will do.  Nice eater sized fish as well.  One question:  If by chance you did go out again and in Canadian waters and caught and kept another few salmonoids and the CO took a look in your freezer (EXTREMELY rare I think), how would you convince the CO that those fish were caught out of country?  Are Lake Michigan fish are tattooed or branded lol????  Burt"
395913,Vanselena,2009-10-24 00:45:00,269,"They could simply test the fish, for example,  in tournaments fish are tested to make sure they were caught in Lake Huron(tournament location) and not caught in Lake Ontario and then transported."
395915,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-24 00:57:00,0,"why are people giving someone a hard time about keeping legal fish? if you don't like it, talk to your politicians, not law abiding anglers. i wouldn't keep that many fish either, but it's not within my right to judge if someone does. let's reserve judgement for those who break rules and save the criticisms in situations like this for the lawmakers."
395920,Dara,2009-10-24 01:09:00,3052,"Congrats on a fun day of fishing.  These posts are a good way to keep people from posting pics here. Why does somebody gotta get ragged on just because he kept a couple of fish. This is a fishing forum. Nobody knows how many were in the party, but half of you have the guy convicted for breaking some kind of law. kids nowadays,  PS, I bet he is laughing his tail off at ya right now"
395948,cram,2009-10-24 02:42:00,1733,The limits are too high.  If every boat kept that many fish there'd be none left.
395976,bigfish1965,2009-10-24 14:30:00,3382," Make no mistake Dara, this is exactly what the OP wanted to happen. It is an attention thing. Not the first time. Doubt it will be the last."
395982,BeRad3000,2009-10-24 15:02:00,65,Well put DR.  Everyone should put this much energy into long  lining and the shark finning industry.
395985,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-24 15:14:00,0,Good catch Vans. You should know that posting a good salmon report on a not so much salmon board that it would go this way. Funny that you never mentioned anything about them lead weights of yours until someone else did first.....
395507,Vanselena,2009-10-22 20:12:00,269,"Took a trip to the blue zone yesterday, caught 4 species, Chinook, Browns, Rainbow and Lakers. 24 fish in all.  "
395509,Kinger,2009-10-22 20:13:00,351,That makes my aggregate limit hurt.
395510,irishfield,2009-10-22 20:18:00,26272,5 guys on board correct....  Nothing like a good stir post on a Thursday afternoon...
395512,richyb,2009-10-22 20:22:00,774,Good you got some for me too. Ive been in need of a good fresh feed of fish.
395513,Vanselena,2009-10-22 20:24:00,269,  LOL
395515,LeXXington,2009-10-22 20:37:00,1928,"Nice catch,  What was the water temps?"
395554,Pigeontroller,2009-10-22 22:55:00,2793,Did any live?
395557,Roy,2009-10-22 22:59:00,13728, Oh hell yeah! Five of the fish are AWOL.... I'm sure they were released!
395577,Vanselena,2009-10-22 23:36:00,269, Surface temp was 50 degrees  While we were cleaning the ones on the floor we kept catching fish. 5 more decided they didn't like the water and were introduced to the filet knife.
395580,Vanselena,2009-10-22 23:38:00,269,"  We did have a few accidental live releases but you can't filet them all, that's why they call it fishing and not catching I guess."
395582,Pigeontroller,2009-10-22 23:39:00,2793,"A bit gluttonous, don't you think?"
395584,Vanselena,2009-10-22 23:46:00,269,"  Nope, my portion of the fish are now in vacuum sealed packages in the freezer. We'll eat them all winter. Now if someone wasted them then that would be wrong. Sorry but I'm not a veggy."
395589,fishhunter,2009-10-22 23:56:00,604,more fish are killed for just eggs this time of year and thrown away so if a guy wants to eat fish good for him!!!If people have a problem with catch and kill why flame a guy that enjoyes eating fish???? Good fishing!!
395590,Guest Johnny Bass,2009-10-23 00:00:00,0,Thats a nice variety of species you have there. All nice sized eaters too.Sounds like a great day of fishing. Thanks for sharing.
395591,richyb,2009-10-23 00:01:00,774,Ill keep my limit of fish too every now and then. Gotta love a fresh feed ! Did you use the torpedo diver to catch those ?
395595,Greencoachdog,2009-10-23 00:11:00,8163,"Looks like a slaughter on the water!!!... but then again, I always do well on a charter trip too!... I figure, if I'm paying ""high-dollar"" for this trip... I'm paying for the fish too!!!  I only charter fish waters I'm unfamiliar with, like 20 to 40 miles offshore in the Gulf of Mexico... if I were to charter a trip in familiar waters, I would feel ashamed!!!   Kind of like hiring a guide to fish waters that you live 2 minutes from... like some members here do!!!"
395596,Roy,2009-10-23 00:12:00,13728,They ARE very nice fish. But the problem is that you can't fish again till you've consumed a few of what you already have. I'm sure you have some good recipes and they'll go fast.
395602,siwash,2009-10-23 00:19:00,683,He's within his legal limit...   Good catch!
395603,siwash,2009-10-23 00:22:00,683,  That depends if he's in possession of 5 fish...  He may have  only kept 4 eaten 1 or 2 within days... the other guys may have taken more  who knows...  you just helped out the big boys for next summer by removing a few smaller fish...
395605,irishfield,2009-10-23 00:23:00,26272," LOL... only if he had 4 guys with him, which has not been confirmed for you to make that statement.  Although I do suspect that is the case.. and Lake O is a put and take fishery on the species caught.  Unfortunate that it was posted in the maner it was simply to stir the pot... otherwise Matt would have started with ""4 buddies and I hit the blue zone today""..."
395612,Greencoachdog,2009-10-23 00:29:00,8163,"  So he can't go Walleye, Pike, Perch, Crappie, Bass... etc etc etc fishing... until he's eaten the Salmonoids???"
395620,figureight,2009-10-23 00:38:00,40,Enjoy those lake ontario lakers. mmmmm
395626,Slop,2009-10-23 00:44:00,151,"Good shootin' in the blue zone man, enjoy the harvest."
395655,Vanselena,2009-10-23 01:32:00,269,"  Swordfish, there are always going to be those that sit at their computer wanting to stir the pot or perhaps try and read into things and then stir the pot (not talking about Swordfish) . Maybe they just need to get out and fish and spend less time on the computer.  In regards to post about limits in the freezer, it is true that you can only keep your limit of a species that was caught in the province or state you reside in. In this case the fish were caught in another country whereby the lake has no part connecting to Ontario so I am pretty sure Ontario limits do not apply. That being said I don't plan on fishing salmon or trout until next spring and it is highly likely my freezer will be void of fish by that time. Fishing in a foreign country, as well as being morally wrong, you would have to be really really stupid to keep or even think of keeping in excess of your legal limit."
395661,Vanselena,2009-10-23 01:38:00,269,"  Hey Richyb, ya we were using torpedo's but we were also using other tools to create the right group dynamic in our spread.  The key to successful fishing is to create a spread that causes the fish to come looking for you instead of you looking for the fish and then give the fish natural offerings, the Torpedo Divers give the opportunity for the natural offerings. As one friend said, "" the fish are congregating and following our spread"""
