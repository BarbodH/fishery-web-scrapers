395521,splashhopper,2009-10-22 21:07:00,2931, Lots of Walmarts will NOT let you park overnight... due to the lack of support to the actual stores themselves.  That's why I pull in to 24 hour Timmies or 24 hour grocery stores
395728,pikehunter,2009-10-23 09:38:00,1659,"Yep that's the answer. I have done it many times.  Slept in truck stops, rest areas, bush, casinos,  campgrounds. Take a cooler, chair, small table coleman stove and a foam mattress in the van after removing the seats as in my case. and in the warm weather tape some screen cloth over your windows  or use magnetic strips to keep it in place.  I did this while working out of town, vacations and fishing trips. You always have your bed and beverages with you, life can be grand! Do it! It's virtually a mini motor home. And remember thousands of hippies did it in the 60's."
394970,Radnine,2009-10-21 02:01:00,1538,"I was wondering what you guys generally do as far as staying or not staying at a fishing outing. I recently went to Rice Lake for some walleye. I looked and looked for someone to share the cottage and the expenses with and ended up going on my own and paying the shot. My nephew on the other hand leaves his house at 4:30 am and is at Rice before 7:00. He fishes with me all day, we eat our catch in my rented cottage, then he leaves after two periods of the hockey game and drives back to Hamilton at 9:30 at night. My cost for the cottage: $200, his cost for the day: Bugger all. Now, I could not do what he did. Partially cause I like the whole thing around staying in a cottage (the more rustic and fish camp like the better) and partially 'cause I am too lazy to jump through those kinds of hoops. But are there ways to lessen my costs? What do you guys do in similar situations? I am considering kitting my van out to make it so I could bunk out in it for the night, then I am wondering where I would park/sleep? Is tent camping a better way? Can I have my cake and eat it too? (meaning is it possible to enjoy the overnight without crazy costs?) I guess what I want to know are some tips for staying and playing without overpaying Thanks! Jim ps. I guess this is an addendum to my camper van question earlier. I have come to the conclusion that the money spent on a camper would buy me lots of cottage stays."

394975,bigugli,2009-10-21 02:07:00,6138,"Over the years I've shared a lot of cabins, cottages and motel rooms with fishing buddies. It's a great way to reduce expense and enrich the experience. After all, half the value of any trip is the memories we share with others along the way."

394981,splashhopper,2009-10-21 02:17:00,2931," Are there Motels in the area up there? If so, they will be a LOT cheaper to sleep overnight at.  I have slept in my van 2/4 weekends past... I park in a 24 hours Timmies lot ( not too close to the store). Sleeping bag or a good down filled comforter works for me so far... The one night the temp got down to -3 and my head got a bit cool... but hey,,, as soon as I covered it up with my spare jacket, I was fine again.

I'm looking at buying a travel trailer now as it;s kind of cramped with the dog. Plus I'm getting tired of sleeping on the ground.  I don't know what you have for a vehicle, but if you have a pickup you can get a camper to go in the back of the trick and then you have your accomodations with you."
394988,basskicker09,2009-10-21 02:32:00,144,camping is the cheapest way to go or making it a group every more people the cheaper it is but you can get camp sites for 25 dollars a night
394995,GBW,2009-10-21 02:43:00,8460,"I had a pick up truck with a tonneau cover over the box and slept in it all over the place.  The problem was the cover was so close to you so if you don't like small spaces you may freak out.  You have to keep the end of the cover open so you can open the tailgate (if you close it).  If I ever had to do it again, pick up truck with a cap and the cap has to have a window or 2 that opens.  An air mattress and your sleeping bag and you are good to go.  I would still do this now in my mid 30's if I had a truck and was fishing all over."
395025,MJL,2009-10-21 03:55:00,2427,"Really cool thread.  I love fishing long sessions pretty far away from home…Can’t get enough of it.  Unfortunately for me I usually don’t have access to a vehicle on a regular basis to do it as much as I would like.  I drive either a Honda Civic or an Accord depending on which one is still in the garage when I need it.  Some things I’ve done in the past beyond staying in a motel include (but aren’t limited to) – Ranked in order of comfort (at least to me):  1. Sleeping on a bedchair beneath a giant umbrella (both designed for carp fishing) 2. Camping in a tent + foam pad + sleeping bag on a campsite 3. Hammock between 2 trees by the lake 4. In a floating canoe – That was awesome (tied to shore of course) 5. Reclined car passenger seat 6. Park bench or picnic table like a hobo 7. The floor of a concrete pier with a backpack as a pillow – The earwigs and potato bugs also liked that too 8. Sleeping on a low hanging branch of a maple tree  I’ve been rained on a few times while sleeping outside without a shelter but I usually have rain gear on anyway and crawl into the fetal position and cover my face (The weather girl was so wrong on those days   ). I always get the best sleep when I’m outside for some reason – Even better than when I stay in motels.  Cool links Splashhopper, Gotta get me a van ASAP"
395029,holdfast,2009-10-21 05:00:00,1813,"Nothing like roughing it if you can, but still be comfortable.  If your uncomfortable without people around, just find a Provincial Park, If you like to be alone, find a lake and a shoreline, or just map recce and find a trail to car camp.  Ive used my Ranger as a Bed with the cap on. Its small but cozy.  Most Ive my work is done at home prepping, even splitting wood, as I dont like to waste time at the camp site.  Here's my examples.  In ten minutes my camp is set up including sleeping gear. box of wood, chair, camping gear in my tool trunk which doubles as a table.  A tarp, cheap one man, 2 pole easy set up tent, with cushion and sleeping bag, clothes act as a pillow.  Sleeping gear, tent clothes in a Hockey Bag.  Toilet is a white pail with garbage bags, also doubles as garbage pail. Ive also stored wood with it      The tool trunk is ideal, although heavy as it has two removable trays.  Food stuffs in one, misc in the other.    Leatherman, can goods, cooking oil, spray, KFS, coffee, sugar and creamer mix, bucket with lighter, flashlights, batteries, headlamp, chem lights etc, bug net, toilet paper, contact gloves, bug juice, compass/map, soap and towel, portable speaker with MP3 Player    Bottom tray with, stove, cook set, grate,water, garbage bags, lantern, hatchet, bowsaw, first aid kit, army rations.

395127,troutologist,2009-10-21 16:10:00,951,"I've been scoping the new boat out as a sweet spot to crash. Im gonna just sleep on the casting deck under the tarp.  Just sleep in your truck. You won't freeze, it wont be the best sleep ever, but I'll guarentee one thing....your gonna be up early to catch fish.   Ive done it in the winter and all other seasons. For a couple hundred bucks you get a great sleeping bag. Or Prop a tarp in the truck bed or get a bivy and sleep there.   Truck sleep= more $ for gas and tackle not to mention its a way better story to tell your buddies."
395133,Jonny,2009-10-21 16:43:00,1380,"I've ""overnighted"" a lot of different ways. Depends on how much comfort you want, I guess. I've spend a lot of pretty comfortable nights in the back of a half-ton with a cap on it when out fishing or hunting.  If I had a van and was staying for only one night I would take out the back seat and set up a bed in the back of it, and that would do just fine. A folding camp chair and a folding table, a Coleman lamp, a little catalytic heater for cold nights (just enough to keep off the chill and the damp), a Coleman pocket stove for making coffee/tea/cup-o-soup, a transistor radio, maybe a tarp running off the roof of the van toward the back or the side. Depends where you can park. I'd be way too cheap to spend $200 for an overnight cottage.  If in a campground an open fire is a cheery way to spend an evening.  The motel idea isn't bad for some extra comfort. You might even get a housekeeping room for a lot less than $200 (probably less than half).  It would be interesting to read a follow-up from you if you try something different than a cottage. Good luck!"
395135,lew,2009-10-21 16:59:00,12766,"We do several 2  day trips a year, each one usually a couple hundred miles from home, and rather than hauling the tent and all the gear, then setting up a camp for such a short time, we just book motels in the area and can usually find something nice for anywhere from $60 - $75 ..........just stay away from a certain motel in Lancaster.........  Nice cheap trip, plus a comfortable bed & good grub at the end of the day."
395210,Radnine,2009-10-21 22:25:00,1538," I mislead you a bit Jocko, the cottage was $200 for two nights. So right away I could cut my expenses by just staying one night.  Thanks to all for the great responses; Splash for the great links, and Holdfast for taking the time to post the photos.  I guess it comes down to the fact that I am a frustrated cottage non-owner. I want a cottage for all of the wonderful things that it brings but am having trouble justifying paying for one (it, them). And at the same time I realize that I am enjoying the cottages I rent for a fraction of the cost of owning one. The idea of camping in a reasonable amount of comfort seems to have set in with me and doesn't appear to be leaving anytime soon. The thought of a Scuttlebutt Lodge on wheels for Will and I is one that will haunt me until I act on it. A class B camper at a ridiculously good price may end up being my answer yet, we'll see. Thanks again guys. I will let you know how it all turns out. Jim"
395253,Jonny,2009-10-22 00:53:00,1380,"Jim, if you like one particular lake (like Rice) well enough, have you checked out availability and what it might cost for a trailer in a campground on that lake?  Might be a cheaper alternative to owning a cottage and give you most everything you want?  Just a thought."

395291,OhioFisherman,2009-10-22 02:27:00,6623,"A very long time since I was at Rice Lake and only once, we stayed in a campground for like two nights? Slept in the 60 chevy wagon the second night, once we had the tent set up it never stopped raining. Never stayed in a tent again.  A couple 3 two day bass tournaments a year before I got sick, no problem for me to sleep in my van for a practice night and first day of the tournament headed home after the end of the tournament. Some if we had enough guys we would rent a cabin or motel room to cheap out.  When we stayed in my van there was usually an all night store near by with a big parking lot so no issues for the boats. Never got a hassle."
