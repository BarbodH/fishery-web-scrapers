393938,danbouck,2009-10-17 20:10:00,4380," ""community""  and yes please discuss the garden!"
393940,Weeds,2009-10-17 20:12:00,782,Why? What's up with your Aunts tomato garden?  Darn. Dan beat me to it.
393942,irishfield,2009-10-17 20:13:00,26272,Does she keep her bushes trimmed back??
393943,fishinguypat,2009-10-17 20:15:00,547,with todays gas prices you can't afford to live in Toronto!!!
393946,danbouck,2009-10-17 20:21:00,4380, If you grow your own tomatoes you can save some money!
394021,jnic,2009-10-18 02:31:00,158,just live off of credit like everyone in t.o.
394065,Lake Ranger,2009-10-18 13:48:00,70,"Hi, there's nice and not-so-nice areas of Etobicoke and Mimico. Lots of really nice pockets of friendly neighbourhoods, tucked in on either sides of and away from the main drags, such as Lakeshore, Royal York, Islington, and Kipling. Alderwood is nice, a bit west of Mimico, and you're right near the 427 which gets you north fast! If you need more info, let me know. I also have to spend time down south in Toronto, and when I do, I live in Etobicoke!"
394068,ehg,2009-10-18 13:58:00,2666," I agree with this opinion, whether renting or buying Mimico is the best area right now. Close to the cities amenities but close enough to the main thoroughfares to get out of town. Close to where you said you were working and some pike fishing spots   A couple i know just bought a house in area and they aren't rich either. Good luck with this."
394079,ch312,2009-10-18 14:44:00,1590,hmmmm....id pick anywhere BUT in the GTA
394094,Beans,2009-10-18 16:06:00,3339, Non-fishing but we could talk about buying boots...or your aunt's tomatoe garden
394110,Dusky,2009-10-18 17:01:00,310,"If you are planning to commute by car south east Mississauga is good choice, if you are planning to use public transits stick to Etobicoke and surrounding neighborhoods. Using public transits from Mississauga could be a pain as less frequency and double fair, where as in Etobicoke its more convince as you will be taking TTC."
394169,holdfast,2009-10-18 22:35:00,1813, Good Call.  Driving from Wasaga to Angus was bad enough during some of those snow storms.
394455,ketchenany,2009-10-19 19:55:00,3229,  I only have parsley left and winter lettuce; my tomatoes froze. Come live in Woodbridge!
394495,baitrummer,2009-10-19 21:27:00,24," Well I do need a good pair of boots to dig my aunts garden don't I?? Beans, I didn't figure you to be a smart asz!!"
394508,Beans,2009-10-19 21:56:00,3339, Usually I'm not but you suprised me with your comment...OFC is much different than Cag where rarely we talk about anything than carp or carp related stuff...

393665,jnic,2009-10-16 14:23:00,158,"may have to move to toronto. looking for a small location north, alliston, bolton, barrie  etc. any info would be great thanks"
393667,Guest gbfisher,2009-10-16 14:27:00,0,you mean you want to move near Toronto? I guess it all depends on what type of work you are looking for.
393675,TC1OZ,2009-10-16 14:38:00,987,Do you want to move to Toronto? or North of Toronto?
393676,fishing n autograph,2009-10-16 14:42:00,2540,"It depends, if you want to live close to the city you could try stouffville, kleinberg, king city, bolton, uxbridge...."
393750,NAW,2009-10-16 19:58:00,4022,It all depends on how long you want your commute to be.  Assuming youâ€™re moving to the area for work.  There's tons of small towns and cities north of T.O.
393752,Dara,2009-10-16 20:24:00,3052,"  Yep, tons, the area is populated like crazy"
393763,Roy,2009-10-16 20:52:00,13728,"Wherever you choose, make sure your home is not west of your work. You'll have sun in your eyes for the drive to work and the drive home. Just thought I'd throw that out there for the folks who don't own sunglasses."
393778,Guest skeeter99,2009-10-16 21:47:00,0,  depends if he works night shift he will not want a home in the east sun in eyes on way to work and home every morning
393781,Roy,2009-10-16 22:01:00,13728, Yes and he'd be  really tired too with 15 hour night shifts every night.
393807,ohhenrygsr,2009-10-16 23:29:00,947,Jane & Finch is a nice neighborhood  Barrie would be my choice
393811,Harrison,2009-10-16 23:33:00,2202," Solid call Roy.  Lots of areas east of TO, not too far of a commute.  I live at the gateway to cottage country and travel to the big smoke everyday.  It's a trade off, but I am content being close to awesome fishing minutes from home.  I have co-workers who live closer to TO and some within the city who have the same commute time wise as me."
393825,Weeds,2009-10-17 00:51:00,782,"I have to agree with Harrison. You can get alot further away from the city should you choose to move East of it and still spend the same time commuting as people who are much closer, say those in Mississauga. Naturally it all depends on where and when you work. I was commuting from Peterborough for awhile but that was a bit of a stretch. Newcastle would be a good distance."
393850,Twocoda,2009-10-17 03:00:00,4130,AH  living in Toronto....longest ten minutes of my life....
393855,danc,2009-10-17 03:48:00,4677,34 Walmer Road. 5 minute walk to anything.  Best 7 weeks of my life. At least it was 30 something years ago.
393868,mbac31,2009-10-17 11:14:00,904,"West Hill is a nice area. I live there. I back onto a Creek, 5 minutes walk from the lake and close to the highway. I can be downtown anytime in 15-20 minutes. I can get piza @ 3 in the morning and be @ the Launch on Scugog by 4am."
393888,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-17 14:21:00,10439,"DON'T DO IT!!!!!!! I commuted from the Orangeville area to TO, Mississauga and Markham areas for 10 years, what a PIA!!! Commute times were anywhere from 2 hours to 4 1/2 hours each way, every day!!!! You end up spending 20 hours plus in traffic each week!!!!!!! When I felt that I was going to go on a shooting spree on the highway, I moved to Yellowknife!!!! All is good now, Great Job, Awesome fishing seconds from home and an 8 minute commute!!!!!! Working in Toronto SUCKS, unless you live there, Commuting for hours when you should be with your family SUCKS!!!!!!"
393891,ketchenany,2009-10-17 14:48:00,3229,"I'm 2 km south of Kleinburg, 2 minutes from hwy 27, 3 minutes from the 400 and BPS, 5 minutes to Hwy 7, all of the conveniences anyone could ever need; the city above Toronto  Nice and quiet, no traffic, but I do commute to King and Dufferin every day and not crazy about it!  Newmarket is nice and so is Maple . . ."
393892,jnic,2009-10-17 15:17:00,158,"Thanks for the info, I will be working down near lakeshore in etobicoke, i believe the area is called mimico. The times i work are not 9-5. thanks again"
393894,alphaalpha,2009-10-17 15:44:00,475,"just a heads up, rush hour times on the 401: 630am-10am, 3pm-7pm and much longer when construction is going on(which is always   )."
393896,Governator,2009-10-17 15:54:00,879,"  I lived in Aurora my whole life and now settled in Barrie.  I don't drive to Toronto everyday and if I had to I certainly wouldn't be living up here.  People who live in Barrie to commute to Toronto everyday are crazy - so many hours of life wasted in driving.  Also FYI - Anything north of highway 9 is part of the Ontario snow belt (Barrie is smack in the middle of it).  It doesn't matter if you work 9-5 or 5-1 you will have terrible drives in the winter if you plan to live here and drive to Toronto everyday.  It's one thing to be stuck in traffic for 2hrs+ each way during rush hour, it's another when you feel your life could be at risk when the snow blows over the 400 between hwy 88-89.  That stretch is one of the worst drives in Ontario in the winter from whiteouts (Just 1 or 2 winters ago there was a 75+ car pileup there).  If you're going to work in Toronto everyday, do yourself a favour and live close."
393909,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-17 17:50:00,10439,"  If you are going to work there look at South East Mississauga. Your commute will be short, there are some nice quiet, old neighbourhoods and it's close to the QEW, but most important is it's close to the launch ramps at Lake Front Promenade Park on Lake Ontario. I lived by Dixie Mall for 15 years and it was a nice area."
393913,siwash,2009-10-17 18:15:00,683," Kleinburg and King a VERY expensive... mostly estate housing... that's where all the hockey players live (Cujo, Wendel, etc...)"
393914,siwash,2009-10-17 18:19:00,683,"  Actually, it's a GREAT city, contrary to what a lot of rural folks think... and it's still one of the safest big cities on the planet... stats will back that up!  I love the great outdoors and I need a break form the city once in a while, but nothing beat the lifestyle, amenities, shopping, dining, culture of a big city...  I guess to each his own...  good luck in your search...  try ViewIT.com for rental info...has entire GTA"
393933,danbouck,2009-10-17 20:06:00,4380,One of my clients has a house for sale in Kleinburg!  Not sure what your budget is but it's only going for about 15
393935,baitrummer,2009-10-17 20:07:00,24, What has this got to do with fishing? Shall we talk about my aunts tomato garden next?
