She has been looking for a couple of weeks now and can't find one anywhere. Does anyone know where she can get one and how much it is. I was hoping to stay warm this year ice fishing. I almost had a two man clam off our classifieds but at the last minute the guy backed out and left me hanging. I think he got a better offer... people can be soooooo rude!! lol Thanks guys. SS"

395545,Handlebarz,2009-10-22 22:33:00,3790,Try Angling Outfitters in Wood stock I know they had alot of them in there last week. I have the Delta and love it I bought it from Slowpoke he bought the Alpha and I think he wanted the Delta back. I have heard from a few people that they like the Delta better its one step down from the Alpha but I never get cold in it even when it was so cold that the minnows were freezing stiff before we could get the hooks into them now shelter and I was warm.
