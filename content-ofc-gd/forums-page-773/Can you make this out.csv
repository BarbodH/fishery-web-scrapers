394772,Harrison,2009-10-20 16:33:00,2202,Probably whats been pissing on your stand.  Looks like one of those ugly mangy bush wolves.
394806,misfish,2009-10-20 18:01:00,29133,I cant wait to get my deer.
394817,Terry,2009-10-20 18:50:00,14456,the more I try to enhance the more problem I have making out what it is  I tried to out line things I see first I thought there was a head and could see eye facing me but then I think I see a head facing away with big ears farther back in the photo   take a look         
394819,BillM,2009-10-20 18:52:00,17367,  Good catch
395004,Skud,2009-10-21 03:04:00,739,It's a Kangaroo
395016,Joey,2009-10-21 03:30:00,9122," I think that the part where you drew the upper head with the ears is not part of the animal Terry.  If you look at a previous photo, that is part of the grass, so it makes identifying the animal deceiving.  Here is a previous photo where that part is there so is not part of the ""owl""  "
395097,ehg,2009-10-21 14:36:00,2666,I thought there was two birds there. One larger one nearer camera and one slightly farther. Maybe ruffed grouse?
394578,misfish,2009-10-20 01:01:00,29133,"Looks like a dog of some sort. It,s in the middle of the pic.    Oh ,and I still couldnt smell anything on the stand.LOL  "

394587,DRIFTER_016,2009-10-20 01:18:00,10439,"Hmmmmmmmmmmmm, pretty tough with the crappy lighting. But this is what it looks like after a little enhancement. El Chupa Cabra maybe?  "
394588,rickster,2009-10-20 01:28:00,495,looks like a yote smells like a yote   must be a yote

394651,Joey,2009-10-20 04:19:00,9122,
394653,bigfish1965,2009-10-20 04:50:00,3382,After hours of extensive examination I reduced the image to a binary equation using a program called Genuine Fractals. This program allows unparalleled image reconstruction for even the lowest resolution images. Here's what came up when i did that... . . .     .    .   .   .
