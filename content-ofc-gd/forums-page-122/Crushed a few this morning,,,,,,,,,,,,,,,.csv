974804,misfish,2016-06-25 17:18:00,29133,"With all the fun with lakers and whities this spring, bass opener was getting on our minds. We know a spot that has produced well for us the past few years and couldnt wait to get back in the game.  5am and on the water and make a bee line to our distination.    Flat water and it was screaming small mouth. I could hear them say, come on, throw that spinner bait, I,ll smack it and spit it out with one giant leap, get you off your game plan and you,ll go home like a crying school boy. I guess they over  thought thier plan, as fat smallies cant jump. Just get thier head above water and slush thier heads a bit,then realize that plan didnt work, so dive and try to break ya off.  Well that didnt work either. Seems I have learned a few lessons myself. Keep,em tight on the line, bury the rod in the water and just stay cool.  I had a great net man today. I do feel his pain as I have been on the other side of him kicking my butt on the river. He is the flipp,n master after all.  Some pics that DONT do these fish justice. We both ageed these fish were in the 5+-7 lb range. Even some jumbo perch that were up there sucking in 4"" tubes. You know thier good ones when you can lip them. LOL                Was hoping to get out for some buckets sunday, but it,s the kids fishing day here, so me and my little fisher girl will be attending that. My arms could use the rest anyways.  Great opener."

974898,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-26 20:46:00,8243,You sure had those Bass Turds dialed in Brian. When you said you made a b line to the spot I was wondering how fast you have to kick those flippers to make a nice wake behind the toon. That's no tune you fished from.
