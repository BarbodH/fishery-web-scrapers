975004,Raycaster,2016-06-27 21:11:00,528,Got an idea I'd like to keep the boat in the garage this winter but looks like a Fulton Fold Away Coupler may be needed to make space.  I see PA has the 3X3 but does anyone sell the 3X4 in the Hamilton area?  I see them online but with shipping costs etc. would be cheaper local I hope.  thx.

So if there's nothing else you need; it'll cost you approx $45.00 for shipping Your total would be approx $126.00 plus tax. I've welded a few of these Fulton couplers on; they seem to be very well made.  Dan.
