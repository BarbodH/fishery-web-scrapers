Thx for sharing. Love the old photos. Reminded me of one my old neighbour showed me of a rope with probably 100 brookies threaded on it and 3 guys holding it up. From his younger days growing up in Haliburton.

I remember the limit on brookies being 15 or 1 fish and 10 pounds, which ever is the least, so you could keep 15 pannies or in trophy waters a 7 and 2 x 5's."
