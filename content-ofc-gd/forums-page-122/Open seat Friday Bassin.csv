I dont get some people, its a charity tournament and someone has the nerve to grab my Xi5 pedal off my deck while we were taking pics and dealing with the weigh in.  Damn thing aint cheap! And hard to find to boot!  Anyways.... Looking for some redemption on the lake this week.  Had 5lbs on sat (4 fish limit due to the heat) and managed 12 sunday. Figures i find them the following day eh?well kinda. Winner had 16lbs sat.  leaving Orangeville friday morning early and will be back in town for mid to late afternoon.  Cheers!"

I have 1 on order that should be here early next week. $249 + shipping  I think this one will get screwed down to the floor or placed inside a locker from now on.  This Friday turned into a bust anyways, life gets in the way of my fishing!!! eergh!"
