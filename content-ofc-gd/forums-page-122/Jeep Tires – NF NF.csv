974969,Raf,2016-06-27 16:57:00,3495,"sell them, they will be a fair bit shorter and the overall diameter of the tires will be quite a bit less causing your speedo to be off."

Dan  Sorry first post I had fat fingers and typed 69 rather then 60.  New link with proper sizes entered. They would still work fine though.  https://www.tacomaworld.com/tirecalc?tires=225-65r17-215-60r17

I don't want to cause any damage to the new vehicle.  BTW I don't speed, if I do, it's nothing over 110 km."
974979,DanD,2016-06-27 18:19:00,2223,"For that small of a difference, I don't see any issues. Like what it shows on the speed chart; there's only a 4klm difference between actual speed and the speedo reading @ 104 clicks. You and the Jeeps computers will likely not even feel/know the difference.  Dan."

I agree for winters they should be fine for winter use. I would just try to avoid potholes

BTW I don't speed, if I do, it's nothing over 110 km.  The only time you would cause any damage is probably if you were to run different sizes or tread patterns.  If they are all the same size and tread pattern, you should be good."
975002,Joeytier,2016-06-27 20:57:00,3990,"You'll be fine, like others have said you will have a slight speedo discrepancy and your alignment will be slightly off, but the difference is fairly minimal there.  My 245/70/17 winters are at least 3"" shorter than my 33"" summers, so I recalibrate my speedo in the fall and spring with my programmer."
975007,misfish,2016-06-27 21:41:00,29133,"I had 18,s on my avenger for the summer and got 17.s for winters. The only issue I was told to be concerned with was clearance for the calipers. I lost 2kph on the speedo. Never had an issue. You will be fine. The thinner tire will cut through the snow better as well.  If you want to sell, let me know. They will fit the ram."
975017,ketchenany,2016-06-27 22:26:00,3229,"B If Anything happens tou'll be the first to know. Right now I'm good to go thanks to the comments given. I have no issues with speed at all I do what the sign says. And, Yes, I use the right lane always.  J how do you recalibrate? Never heard of that!"
975037,Joeytier,2016-06-28 01:00:00,3990,"I do it through my performance programmer, but I don't see why you couldn't go to a shop and get it done."
975043,ecmilley,2016-06-28 01:45:00,2163,Just make sure the slightly smaller tires have the same.load rating other than that as long as there within 3% of one diameter there ok
