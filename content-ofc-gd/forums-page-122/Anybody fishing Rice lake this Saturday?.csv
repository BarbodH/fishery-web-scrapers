974544,Stoty,2016-06-22 18:46:00,2910,"Weedlines in 6-10ft of water will produce all day long. Flip the edges with jigs, bucktail jigs and plastics. Cast parallel to the weedlines with crankbaits. Walleye were on fire last weekend."
974591,Shloim,2016-06-23 11:40:00,515,"One reply, thats it? Makes me feel like the one legged guy at the ass kicking contest, Sheesh, thanks Stoty!"
974600,Sinker,2016-06-23 13:19:00,8692,"Stoty pretty much covered it all. Do that, and you will get fish.  I'm working this weekend.  Any probs out there, shoot me a pm, I live close by.  S."
974607,young_one,2016-06-23 14:08:00,620,"Buckets are a tad shallower, try 5-7FOW. Flipping jigs, t-rigged plastics. Healthy milfoil flats adjacent to deep water or points. Bluegil or perch imitation colours are a good starting point."
974608,AKRISONER,2016-06-23 14:11:00,5558,check the charts for areas with edges and possible current...deep weeds are your friend. the deeper the weeds the better.
