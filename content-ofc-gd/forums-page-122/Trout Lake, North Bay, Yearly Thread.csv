I kept hearing ""the fish are deep!"" but I had one downrigger running the thermocline @ ~52 degrees and one rigger ranging between 60-100ft. Almost every hit was on the shallower line. Possibly just chance. PS sorry about the nakedness, I was trying to catch some sun and wanted a quick release - no time to put a shirt on!  "
