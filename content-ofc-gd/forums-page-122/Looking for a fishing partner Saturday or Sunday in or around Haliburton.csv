I realize it's bass opener so it's going to be extremely busy and I'm sure a lot of you are already registered for tournaments but this came up last minute. I will obviously split on gas and meet up at any lake/launch in the area. If Sunday morning is an option, I'll be driving back to Toronto so if the lake/launch isn't in the Haliburton area, I would gladly meet you Sunday morning somewhere between Haliburton and Toronto.  Feel free to either respond here or PM me, either is greatly appreciated! Thanks guys!"
