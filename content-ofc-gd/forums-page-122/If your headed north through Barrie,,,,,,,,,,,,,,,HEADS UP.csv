974738,fishing n autograph,2016-06-24 20:34:00,2540,And the 427 is shut down near highway 7
974739,BillM,2016-06-24 20:38:00,17367,Aren't they tearing down the bridge south of Mapleview as well sometime soon?   I thought I read a highway closure on one of those MTO signs.

And soon they will build one for Harvie Rd. Not soon enough though. That will be a sweet short drive home. LOL

974749,misfish,2016-06-24 21:27:00,29133," Even worse, Essa..   4 sets of lights within a span of what?  a couple hundred feet?  lol   Hahahahah ya.

974751,BillM,2016-06-24 21:54:00,17367,"Yeah Harvie will be great, right near the new place (Just up from you, Ferndale/Essa area)"
974754,bigcreekdad,2016-06-24 22:25:00,546,We are heading up to the French Sunday from Ohio. Does anyone recommend a bypass for this?

974763,bigcreekdad,2016-06-25 00:02:00,546,Thanks Brian
974766,Pikeslayer,2016-06-25 00:27:00,1443,"I've had this theory/plan in mind for a few years now. I think that MTO should close all entries & exits, north & south, to the 400 from Innisfil Rd to the south, north to the 400/11 split from Thursday 8:00 pm through Sunday 8:00 pm. This would make it much more convenient via improved traffic flow to those of us travelling north to Seguin with little or no inconvenience to the fine residents of Barrie???"
974799,smitty55,2016-06-25 16:03:00,928,"Another heads up for Barrie. My neighbour is from there and was visiting for the weekend. Had a few pops with some old friends and was walking back as he didn't want to drive. Anyway, he's had kidney problems in the past and had to have a leak real bad. So he gets out of sight to relieve himself. Finishes and turns around to see a cop watching him. No sympathy at all and hands him a $180 ticket. Jerk.  Cheers"
