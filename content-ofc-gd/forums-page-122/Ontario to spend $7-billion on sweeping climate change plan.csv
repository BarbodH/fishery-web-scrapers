How did your self described environmental freak guy graph Co2 levels back 600 million years ago?  They can estimate co2 levels by analyzing actual co2 in ice core samples but that only goes back 800,000 years. https://scholarsandrogues.com/2012/01/28/csfe-co2-in-800000-year-old-air/ That is why the co2 level stops at 800,000 years ago in the graph below. The correlation looks VERY STRONG between atmospheric temps and co2 levels. How does your freak-guy explain that? "

All Ontario has to do is meet their share of Canada's targets. They chose to make reductions that FAR exceed what they need to. By a LOT.

No...because this is not a balancing of science with valid skepticism...it's just plain propaganda...it's garbage.  I do agree on one point, it's not like much higher levels of Co2 will lead to the end of the planet...it won't.  It's more like we are a bunch of lemmings jumping of a predictable and avoidable population cliff. For those who think the earth's population is to high we going to let the earth shed us of our excesses. It won't be pretty.

The indisputable fact remains that the earth has relatively just finished coming out of an ice age and whether or not there is human activity on the planet it is going to get warmer due to a lot of forces, most of which we have no control over. Local fossilized remains vividly show us that it was a hell of a lot warmer here  than it is now and eventually will probably again. I think trying to micromanage the climate for the brief blip that we and our kids and grand kids are on the planet is an exercise in futility."

Then we come out of the land of narrative and we look at a graph like this one below. The ""biblical like"" story of the deniers just doesn't match up to reality, ....which is science.

974691,scuro2,2016-06-24 12:10:00,904,Good question Dave. Is the recent warming natural variance or man made?       If you see how closely temp and Co2 concentrations track then looking at the graph above and noting that it goes only 2007 you would guess that global temperatures should go up.     ...and in fact they have. Since that first graph that goes only to 2007 Co2 levels have risen from from 383 ppm to 400. You could predict that global average temperatures on average will continue to rise.

I didn't ask ""does Wynne do a good job"". I asked ""do you believe air pollution is a hoax, and if not do you believe we should do something"". Nothing more.  This is because I continually get a bunch of hate about Wynne, which I never asked about or for. A person I've repeatedly condemned then get told I'm ""hitting on her like a school boy"".  I had to simplify the question because apparently it was a tough one.  Now that at least one person has agreed ""we should do something"" (and it only took us 384 replies to get there), we can talk about what that something is.  I have ideas. I don't claim to have answers.  I'm at work and have to actually get something done now, but I will come back later on to discuss the something, if anyone still cares."

I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone on this board who doesn't agree with that statement.  She'll be gone in a few years (hope, hope, hope!) so let's talk about what we think her replacement should do.  The one thing I notice from my Son and his friends is their positivity.

I'm retired and we have only one vehicle, a 2006 Liberty with 72,000 kms, what's that, 7200 kms a year but I just renewed my plates at $108, same as a high mileage driver   . Let's take this as the base amount and for everytime you multiply my mileage you multiply your license fee by a corresponding amount, so if you drive 5 X 7200 km. in a year, your license fee would be 5 X $108 dollars.

Harper had become a detriment to Canada and to the concept of democracy.  My policies/ideas are mine because I've given them a lot of thought. I also don't believe they line up very well with Wynne at all. I'd like to see any example of my supporting a policy of hers, or proposing a policy that is anything like hers. I do not think you'll find one comment in my entire post history along those lines.  A few people made a mistaken assumption and the hive mind here has taken it to be fact. It isn't.

Seems I'm not the only person that feels this way.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/9815862/Humans-are-plague-on-Earth-Attenborough.html    Humans are a plague on the Earth that need to be controlled by limiting population growth, according to Sir David Attenborough.              By Louise Gray, Environment Correspondent 12:01AM GMT 22 Jan 2013 Comment   The television presenter said that humans are threatening their own existence and that of other species by using up the world’s resources.  He said the only way to save the planet from famine and species extinction is to limit human population growth.  “We are a plague on the Earth. It’s coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so. It’s not just climate change; it’s sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now,” he told the Radio Times.  Sir David, who is a patron of the Population Matters, has spoken out before about the “frightening explosion in human numbers” and the need for investment in sex education and other voluntary means of limiting population in developing countries.  “We keep putting on programmes about famine in Ethiopia; that’s what’s happening. Too many people there. They can’t support themselves — and it’s not an inhuman thing to say. It’s the case. Until humanity manages to sort itself out and get a coordinated view about the planet it’s going to get worse and worse.”   Related Articles   The end of the world is not nigh   Attenborough: If we do not control population, the natural world will   Sir David Attenborough: Humans have stopped evolving   Pop music is 'hugely sexual', Sir David Attenborough says   British people care about losing countryside because they have endured it for longest, Sir David Attenborough says   Brian Cox: the next Attenborough?    Sir David, whose landmark series are repeated from Monday on BBC2, starting with Life on Earth, has also spoken out about the change in wildlife documentaries during his lifetime. The 86-year-old said commentary from presenters like himself are becoming less necessary as camera work is able to tell a story. “I’m not sure there’s any need for a new Attenborough,” he said. “The more you go on, the less you need people standing between you and the animal and the camera waving their arms about. “It’s much cheaper to get someone in front of a camera describing animal behaviour than actually showing you [the behaviour]. That takes a much longer time. But the kind of carefully tailored programmes in which you really work at the commentary, you really match pictures to words, is a bit out of fashion now … regarded as old hat.”"

There is enough money for all our needs if it is properly managed (which it currently is not).  Also, I find it interesting that you think we will be able to afford reduced wait times with millions more people needing treatment because we did nothing about air pollution. Can you explain the math on that one? Give your head a shake, it is sad that people like you are actually running the government now.

Living in the city give people access to public transportation, lot's of restaurants, night clubs, museums, theaters, etc. all close by.  You may prefer to be close to a remote lake, but others prefer to be close to the attractions of a big city.  E.g. my co-worker told me that her brother won't live in Toronto because it's too small.

China's consumption of coal is going down.  http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/29/china-coal-consumption-drops-again   Please read a bit closer. Coal use is down because the economy is tanking due to the oversupply they caused. a 34% increase in wind power means they had 50 wind turbines and built 17 more 74% increase in solar means they had a small farm and built another a bit smaller. I see no real numbers in there, just hype.  Ontario has closed ALL of its coal fired plants and replaced them with NG, solar and wind. We are currently building hydro plants on every little river that can support it, viable or not and whether the locals want it or not, see Bala falls. This government still doesn't care what the people want, they are just following their agenda. Our power rates have quadrupled in the last 10 years and are going higher.

We have a 36 unit wind farm here that caused the total destruction of at least 100 acres of trees per windmill. Thats plus access roads that amounts to another 100 acres per windmill.  How much carbon dioxide does a windmill save when we dump 80% of the power produced. How much carbon dioxide did it produce in the manufacturing and construction of each windmill.  I am hearing arguments lately that Canada actually consumes more CO2 than it produces  I would like to see a few calculations before I believe this Premier is actually saving the planet.

You need to go back thousands if not 100s of thousands of years  Exactly, they have documented a Medieval Warm Period from 1000 to 1400 AD and what is referred to as the Little Ice Age from 1400 to 1900 AD, so we are in a warming period again, going to happen and we can not change it, just how much we are are contributing is pure speculation, maybe in a few hundred years they will be able to say we screwed up or they will refer to us as the ""Chicken Little "" generation."

971276,Dutch01,2016-05-26 20:00:00,1431," We have observed a depletion of the ozone, and determined that Freon was a major contributor. Was that speculation? Similarly, I don't believe that since we don't have one thousand years of temperature records we should just ignore the records we do have. More data is never a bad thing.  We know that if you close yourself in a garage with a running car, you will die. And yet millions of cars pour emissions into the environment every day. Regardless of whether or not these emissions are changing the climate, we know they are poisonous. Shouldn't we be using technology to reduce pollution whether the ""chicken little's"" are right or not?  Someone mentioned earlier in this thread that they'd go electric as soon as they make an electric pickup that can tow his boat to the cottage. Fair enough. We have electric vehicles that can tow much more than gas trucks already. They're called trains. The reason we don't have electric pickups is due to battery limitations.  There are those who will reply to me that as soon as there's a profit in it, industry will come along to fill a need. I generally don't disagree with that kind of thinking. But in this case, industry can make more money by poisoning us. That is why our government should use policy to guide the stakeholders (industry and citizens) towards a mutually sustainable society. That may mean subsidies, it may mean prohibitions. There's a lot of discussion to be had. But right now there's a well  financed lobby trying not to have the discussion at all.  Finally, I'm not as old as some of you fellas, but I'm 45 years old and the Wynne Liberals are the most corrupt government I can recall in my lifetime. They are not the people to implement anything, let alone something this important. Further, they are idealists who make decision based on belief.  We need realists, not idealists. Because if we don't fix this, it will eventually catch up to us. Maybe not soon, maybe not for 20 or 50 generations. No one really knows. But I do know you can't mix poison in our air forever and not pay the piper someday."
971295,scuro2,2016-05-26 21:20:00,904,"Right on Dara.  I don't know how but I expect wynne to get in again.  This post probably made the keenest observation of the last batch.  Indirectly I'm defending Wynne by making the case that climate change exists. I don't like that position.  If you are a denier those around you don't like being put in that position either. When the obvious is denied because of willful ignorance or politics you get polarization, those you try to influence don't vote like you.  There have been awesome Conservatives and I have voted for them. I am fiscally conservative by nature yet the recent Ontario and Federal Conservative parties have chosen leaders who have been catering to Commonsensers and these leaders have sucked.  Frankly I think Climate Change to be such an important issue that I have just voting Green party and will continue to do so until there is concrete change.

Highly probable  The world is far gone. 7 billion does nothing, nadda, zip, zilch  If india and china do the same, will it help? Nope, move along  If the weather is the hottest on record for 12 straight months, doesnt that show our role in global warming? nope, 12 months is but a drop in a 150 billion gallon pail for comparison.

970521,lifeisfun,2016-05-21 09:23:00,99," That is a good argument. What does one month of record extreme high temperatures prove in the last 150 years? Nothing. How about 12 such months in a row, and counting, plus many other extreme anomalies occurring at the same time? Then one can safely deduct that it is highly probable that this is not natural variance and that something is influencing outcomes. This is what the climate scientists have done. This is their conclusion. 97% of them believe what we are seeing is caused by us.  You are also right $7B will not change the path of what looks to be the beginning of an exponential curve to extreme climate. At best 7B$ will flatten the curve a little bit.  Scientists have also predicted outcomes based on this information and frankly speaking what they predict will happen in our lifetime is alarming. As a government, when do you start to act on what is predicted to be a world wide catastrophe? I would say now because although one can't predict with certainty what will happen, you don't want to play the odds when there is a good chance that the world as we know it will be permanently altered to a point that we won't recognize it.  Do we really want to be, ""penny wise and pound foolish"".  Here is a question for you. That 7 b dollars you mentioned. Have you calculated what that works out to be per year? Is that 7B$ to be funded over many years?  Well, looks like you found new religion I can't believe you would find 150 year time sample as evidence of anything relating to billions years of history. Not to mention the way that data was created. Good luck!"
970525,scuro2,2016-05-21 12:23:00,904,"So the argument is that a rapidly rising global temperatures means nothing, the earth was warmer before, and man can't alter the climate because we are so insignificant?It is thought that the warmest the planet ever got was during Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum when the planet was 5-8 degrees warmer and you had tropical vegetation in the polar regions. What most likely caused this spike? Green house gases. Why are temperatures rising quickly now? Mostly, green house gases that man has added to his environment.  These are not my home spun musings based on my theory of everything, rather this is what 97% of scientists believe based on data and the power of evidence based deduction.  Those darn scientists with their data, and willingness to share everything with the public. They don't leave much room for other""experts""!

970632,scuro2,2016-05-22 12:06:00,904,Here is a tidbit for those who haven't yet determined that climate science is a hoax perpetrated by the world wide scientific community.  Accurate weather measurements go back to 1850. Thus the odds of every record month would be 1/164.  If weather is random then calculating the odds of 12 record months in a row would look like this 1/164 x 1/164 x 1/164 x 1/164 x 1/164 x 1/164 x 1/164 x 1/164 x 1/164 x 1/164 x 1/164 x 1/164  Those are very slim odds.

What you describe would be a conspiracy. If climate change didn't exist, to then get many scientists from around the globe to agree to one giant FRAUD. Many people would have to be in on it because the data presented is so rich and comes from many sources."
970720,manitoubass2,2016-05-23 04:47:00,11391,"Lots of science IS FRAUD my friend lol.  Im all for science but its ripe in many(not all) areas.  and where is this 97% number combing from?  You have mentioned it numerous times.  Did somebody really speak to every scientist involved in this area(climate change) to come to this number?  also your 12 month projection numbers are flawed. Its an assumption and not fact. 12 straight months of hotter temperatures is a trend, but it cant be proven what is causing it. So your numbers/calculation means nothing scientifically other than it looks impressive to someone with no experience ie""wow thats a pretty big number"" lol.  ive worked with studies many a years, I can skew them in my favor no problem, or, I can do it correctly(without bias)  Not every scientist out there has the moral compass of an impressive man/women.  You are very naive to human characteristics imo"
970721,manitoubass2,2016-05-23 05:05:00,11391,"Conspiracy and conspiracy theory mean two different things. Im sure you are aware of that.  We know a few things logically. Emitting huge quantities of green house gasses are not good for our enviroment. We can chalk that on the board. Science can work with that and show some damage no doubt.  You would be an idiot to deny it. Sort of like sucking exhaust from your tailpipe so to speak.  But, on the grand scale nothing is proving this is either heating nor cooling the planet. And there are no previous models to help distingiush what some think is happening. You cant build a feasoble model to prove it. We have no literature from 5000 years ago with technology to help us out.  We are flying blind.  The only thing we know, without zero doubt, is the earth goes through cycles of cooling and warming. That is indeed a fact.  And logically, this would take many years. Obviously an ice age isnt going to start tomorrow, correct? It just doesnt happen like that. The earth, like the human body, likes homeostasis. So changes occur slowly.  So if we were to enter an ice age, and it was to start tomorrow, it would likely take many, many years to come to that point. Same as heating, as you point out in your 12 month model, its increasing but slowly. This is logical. Its not going to increase for 6 years, decrease for one, increase for 4, decrease for ten. Nature just does not work like that. Now im talking grandious scale changes, not last winter to this winter, or vise versa. Yeah we see obvious slight fluctuations and thus is normal.  Anyhow, its an interesting topic.  Too bad we will be dead before anyone has an answer"
970722,scuro2,2016-05-23 11:54:00,904,"I would reply that there is a very obvious and measurable historical relationship of C02 in the air and temperature.  http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/globalwarming/temperature-change.htmlWhen you look at that graph the high end is 300 ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere. We are at 380 ppm and rising. The rise in CO2 is not linear, it is curved which means exponential growth and mostly likely not an a continuous gradual change in temperature. We are currently near the bottom of the curve so changes will not seem as dramatic, until they are.  12 months of record high global temperatures is highly unusual. If one takes into account that this was an El Nino year then if we take the average of an El Nino once every 4 years there would have been 41 El Nino events since 1850 when we first started measuring and recording global temperatures. The odds of 12 record months in a row in  El Nino years would: 1/40 x 1/40 x 1/40 x 1/40 x 1/40 x 1/40 x 1/40 x 1/40 x 1/40 x 1/40 x 1/40 x 1/40 = 1.6777216 to the exponent 19You are right, temperature rise won't go straight up but climate events that we are seeing now are already extraordinary. By coincidence the ice is melting quickly this year on the north pole http://icons.wxug.com/hurricane/2016/charctic-5.19.16.jpgYou'll get your answer before your dead...all we need is for melting to occur on Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, and several feet of added water to the oceans will disrupt the world as we know it.

970466,scuro2,2016-05-20 20:23:00,904," And this is proof of exactly what? Those $7B will do nothing to change any of that.  That is a good argument. What does one month of record extreme high temperatures prove in the last 150 years? Nothing. How about 12 such months in a row, and counting, plus many other extreme anomalies occurring at the same time? Then one can safely deduct that it is highly probable that this is not natural variance and that something is influencing outcomes. This is what the climate scientists have done. This is their conclusion. 97% of them believe what we are seeing is caused by us.  You are also right $7B will not change the path of what looks to be the beginning of an exponential curve to extreme climate. At best 7B$ will flatten the curve a little bit.  Scientists have also predicted outcomes based on this information and frankly speaking what they predict will happen in our lifetime is alarming. As a government, when do you start to act on what is predicted to be a world wide catastrophe? I would say now because although one can't predict with certainty what will happen, you don't want to play the odds when there is a good chance that the world as we know it will be permanently altered to a point that we won't recognize it.

And destroy another industry at the same time.  Bye bye Ontario, I'm done.      http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ontario-to-spend-7-billion-in-sweeping-climate-change-plan/article30029081/  The Ontario government will spend more than $7-billion over four years on a sweeping climate change plan that will affect every aspect of life – from what people drive to how they heat their homes and workplaces – in a bid to slash the province’s carbon footprint.  Ontario will begin phasing out natural gas for heating, provide incentives to retrofit buildings and give rebates to drivers who buy electric vehicles. It will also require that gasoline sold in the province contain less carbon, bring in building code rules requiring all new homes by 2030 to be heated with electricity or geothermal systems, and set a target for 12 per cent of all new vehicle sales to be electric by 2025.  While such policies are likely to be popular with ecoconscious voters, who will now receive government help to green their lives, they are certain to cause mass disruption for the province’s automotive and energy sectors, which will have to make significant changes to the way they do business. And they have already created tension within the government between Environment Minister Glen Murray and some of his fellow ministers who worry he is going too far.  The 57-page Climate Change Action Plan was debated by Premier Kathleen Wynne’s cabinet Wednesday and subsequently obtained by The Globe and Mail. Stamped “Cabinet Confidential,” the document lays out a strategy from 2017 to 2021. It contains about 80 different policies, grouped into 32 different “actions.” Each action has a price tag attached to it, as well as an estimate of the amount of emissions it will cut by 2020.  The Globe had previously uncovered details of the plan, but this is the first time the full blueprint has been revealed. The strategy is scheduled to be further reviewed by cabinet ministers and fine-tuned, sources said, with public release slated for June.  The many new programs will be paid for out of revenue from the province’s upcoming cap-and-trade system, which is expected to be approved by the legislature this week and come into effect at the start of next year. Together, the cap-and-trade system and the action plan are the backbone of the province’s strategy to cut emissions to 15 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020, 37 per cent by 2030 and 80 per cent by 2050.  “We are on the cusp of a once-in-a-lifetime transformation. It’s a transformation of how we look at our planet and the impact we have on it,” reads a preamble to the plan signed by Ms. Wynne. “It’s a transformation that will forever change how we live, work, play and move.” Highlights include: The actions expected to cause the largest emissions cuts by 2020 are moving buildings and the electricity system off natural gas (three million tonnes); programs to make industry more energy efficient (2.5 million tonnes); the low-carbon fuel standard (two million tonnes); the renewable content requirement for natural gas (one million tonnes); and switching trucks and buses to liquefied natural gas and electricity (400,000 tonnes.)  Cutting natural gas, which currently provides 76 per cent of heating, will require mass adoption of green technologies in buildings across the province. The plan lists geothermal systems, air heat pumps and rooftop solar panels as technologies that will be eligible for rebates. It could also require an expansion of the electricity grid. The plan promises, however, to subsidize any increased electricity costs for homeowners.  The electric vehicle targets represent a sea change for the province’s $16-billion auto sector. The 2025 goal would boost to about 86,000 the number of annual electric vehicle sales, more than 20 times the number of electric vehicles sold in the province so far this century.  Already, the plan is causing tension within government, pitting Mr. Murray against Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli and Economic Development Minister Brad Duguid. Mr. Murray’s colleagues, sources said, complained that he often did not bother to consult with other ministers as he drafted the strategy, and ignored their advice when he did.  Energy officials were particularly concerned about the new Green Bank, contending its functions could be handled by the Independent Electricity System Operator, sources said. Mr. Duguid, meanwhile, was worried about the effect on the auto sector. Mr. Murray also aggravated colleagues with an Economic Club speech last month, in which he chastised auto companies for not doing enough to fight climate change and mused about closing down the province’s nuclear power plants.  The behind-the-scenes battle played out at a meeting of cabinet ministers involved in the climate file two weeks ago, when Mr. Chiarelli and others confronted Mr. Murray with their complaints, sources said. After The Globe subsequently revealed the clash, all parties have tried to play it down.  “We’re working very well together. I’m very excited about it. We have a very, very good strong team and we’ve worked very hard for two years,” Mr. Murray said last week.  Mr. Chiarelli, for his part, acknowledged there had been “debate” at Wednesday’s cabinet meeting, but said it ended with “100 per cent consensus” on the climate plan.  “We have a normal amount of debate on this issue,” he said. “If you were to get a leak on every cabinet meeting, you would find out, you know, that there’s a good airing of points of view on issues.”  Asked if Mr. Murray had to change or water down the plan to get cabinet buy-in, Mr. Chiarelli cracked a grin. “You know what? I’d be breaking my oath if I told you that,” he said. “You know that.”"

""Gas studies at volcanoes worldwide have helped volcanologists tally up a global volcanic CO2 budget in the same way that nations around the globe have cooperated to determine how much CO2 is released by human activity through the burning of fossil fuels. Our studies show that globally, volcanoes on land and under the sea release a total of about 200 million tonnes of CO2annually. This seems like a huge amount of CO2, but a visit to the U.S. Department of Energy's Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) website (http://cdiac.ornl.gov/) helps anyone armed with a handheld calculator and a high school chemistry text put the volcanic CO2 tally into perspective. Because while 200 million tonnes of CO2 is large, the global fossil fuel CO2emissions for 2003 tipped the scales at 26.8 billion tonnes. Thus, not only does volcanic CO2 not dwarf that of human activity, it actually comprises less than 1 percent of that value.""  http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/archive/2007/07_02_15.html  https://www.skepticalscience.com/volcanoes-and-global-warming.htm  "

969890,Dutch01,2016-05-16 17:41:00,1431,"I think we all need to separate this discussion into 2 issues:  1) do you believe that we should leverage new technology in order to move away from combustion of fossil fuels to generate energy?  I think that's an easy one.  Even if you don't believe that greenhouse gases are causing climate change, anyone with half a brain knows that putting combustion by-products in the air we breath isn't smart.  So if the technology is there, why wouldn't we use it? In my opinion, it's not there - yet. Business will never go there until forced, or until convinced the status quo is less profitable than change. Consumers are lazy and will buy the cheapest thing first, and think about the environment later, if ever.  I do think we need to nudge people along. If we have the option to not pollute, we should exercise it.  Which brings us to part two:  2) is the present Provincial Liberal government trustworthy or capable enough to move us towards a better way?  For me at least, the answer is a resounding no. I don't think they can do anything right. I think they are both incompetent, and corrupt.  The reason I point all this out is those attacking the Liberals should differentiate between the messenger and the message.  The messenger is rotten to the core, but as outdoorsmen we should always aim to minimize man's impact on the environment we love."

A 1000 years ago when the Vikings first came to North America, the climate was much warmer, Greenland was indeed a green land and they called either Newfoundland or Quebec Vinland because of the copious grapes. Their first settlements were agricultural based, but eventually after a couple of 100 years it turned colder and they moved to livestock and fishing only to eventually abandon settling. I ask what caused this warm period in the past, coal fired power plants ?? or perhaps there is natural cycles in our climate that are evident looking at the long term rather than a few decades of recent data.  edit: this graph illustrates it nicely  "

Good points Dutch and when the technology is there at a fair price I might consider it.  But it isn't and most likely won't be anytime soon, if at all in my lifetime.  I feel this is all to fill the pockets of ""Orville's"" new hydro buddies and get some kickbacks to boot.  As you said, this messenger is rotten to the core and I wouldn't trust them to wipe my ass let alone run our province. Many naive people of this province did and are most likely regretting it now.  The next election will tell."

I dont believe for one second we cannot create a clean system thats powerful, affordable and effective.  Plain and simple, you are not pulling trillions of dollars out of those .01%s hands. EVER"
