974522,Terry,2016-06-22 12:41:00,14456,There is an app for Apple TV.  Don't know if it's free or not.  I don't have an apple so I'm not sure which it is.

I see the New Flyfisher and some other north american shows.  It needs you to have the Youtube addon  installed as most of this is on there. This video shows installing the repo and addon.  "
