974082,Black_Blade,2016-06-18 00:56:00,258,"Heading up to Temiscaming tomorrow morning with a friend and planning on putting in at the dam at Temiscaming and fishing down the Ottawa, never fished it and was hoping for a few tips/tactics to try.  Gonna have couple dozen minnows and worms as well as regular tackle.  Not particular on the fish we catch, be nice to snag some pike or walleye.  Was thinking of trolling a Rapala on a Carolina Rig maybe... We have a simple Piranha Humminbird sonar on the boat, for what thats worth  Is the dam construction done yet or do we have to put in at Thorne?"
974093,Joeytier,2016-06-18 02:51:00,3990,"Put in at Thorne, they have a nice launch built there now.  Since you will have live bait, I suggest you stick to the Ontario side or don't bring the bait, the Quebec wardens are handing out $400 tickets like candy right now to people fishing on the QC shore with live bait fish, as ridiculous as that may sound to you.  This time of year you really don't need it if you're competent at jigging plastics.  These first couple weeks after the sanctuary lifts is typically good fishing, but you won't be alone, and you may have to wade through a bunch of dinks.  Never caught many bass or pike in that stretch oddly enough, just lots of walleye and sauger"

The go to bait was Black and metal flake silver floating Rappala. Crazy as it sounds but we would use nothing else for Walleye then including live bait.  Go get em!!!"
974153,Black_Blade,2016-06-18 21:35:00,258,"Update: Just got back..not even a nibble..  Tried some electric motor trolling with Original Rapala on heavy weighted Carolina Rig, 3/8 jig and minnow when seen some fish marking about 5 feet off bottom..nada.  Allowed boat to drift back over fish marking and cast swim baits back and brought em in with the wind..nope.  Ah well..nice weather anyways!"

974190,Rod Caster,2016-06-19 16:58:00,5784,I've had some rough days in the Ottawa. Morning and evenings rule. Look for rock shoals or Boulder piles mid river.
