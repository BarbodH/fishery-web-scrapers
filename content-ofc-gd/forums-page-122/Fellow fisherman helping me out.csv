Knew the launch was a little sketchy cause it was gravel, but went for it with my front wheel drive crv.  Got caught and couldn't take the boat out of the water.  A fellow fisherman that I just passed fishing with his daughter came over and helped me to push my truck out of the gravel.  Thought I would mention this good gesture made by this guy."

Another time, when nobody around, I found that if you get the entire vehicle into the water, the ground is much harder packed (at least where I was)...lets you get some forward momentum and then the loose gravel is not as bad. Seems counterproductive (to back up a bit) but worked great."
