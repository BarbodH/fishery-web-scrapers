975086,Terry,2016-06-28 18:59:00,14456,80 would be perfect but you could go a little smaller if its a really good price I also think a power drive type electric rather then cable steer would suit your boat best
975092,Fisherpete,2016-06-28 20:20:00,1814,I would go 80 lbs thrust and 24V Adam. I've seen underpowered pontoons struggle badly in any wind.  Pete

975099,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-28 21:18:00,8243,"If a member here was selling used or a member recommends something I would take that into consideration vs. buying from someone I don't know from Adam on Kijiji for example. I probably have a few years on you guys and as I always say experience is a lifetime of mistakes, wisdom is not making them again. I have gotten great deals privately and have been taken by a few as well. I wouldn't expect a 1 year warranty all you need is 30 days, money back guarantee. If someone doesn't believe it will last at least 30 days I pass on the deal. I spent $14000.00 on a used Lund that was being sold ""As is"" and I asked for a 30 day warranty for leaks. The Readers Digest version is that boat was cracked from stem to stern and I brought the boat back and got all my money returned. That also taught me to splash a boat before money changed hands."
975115,Raycaster,2016-06-29 01:03:00,528,"Took a few years but I saved up for the Terrova 80 as mentioned.  Here is a pic of the mount and  pic of the transducer mount. The transducer in in a 1/2"" PVC pipe I believe (perfect to bend if caught on rock etc.)  Still haven't designed a better front gate setup but soon...  If you have a bimini or face heavy winds you'll want 80lb minimum.   "

Raycaster, thanks for the pictures, that's a great idea with the pvc running transducer mount.  OI: it would take some definite kind of guarantee to get me to buy from Kijiji, the forums are a little different though. Especially a community such as this one.  Lol @ swervy Pete!"
975129,Sinker,2016-06-29 02:59:00,8692,"Cable drives turn the motor with cables that are attached to the footpedal. They are quicker to respond to turning, but the footpedal cant be moved very far from the trolling motor.  Power drives are turned with an electric motor, anf the foot pedals have a 20ft cord so you can steer the boat from anywhere. They also have a continuous on function, so you just flip a switch, and slowly move along, then adjust steering when needed.  I do a lot of slow trolling with mine,  so i set the bowmount straight, and steer with my main engine from the drivers seat. No need to have my foot on the pedal.  S."
975130,John Bacon,2016-06-29 03:02:00,3277,"What is the difference between a cable drive and a power drive? Pros and cons of each...?   Cable drive will give you better control over the steering when your foot is on the pedel.  It should also give you better battery life because you are not using battery power to steer.  The power drive can be controlled from anywhere on the boat and has the option of auto pilot features such as holding a straight line, locking on a position, saving a trolling route.  They also take up less space without the cable foot pedel."
974951,adam lancia,2016-06-27 11:13:00,234,"My cousin has a 16' pontoon boat and we use that to fish from but we'd like to get a trolling motor for it. Any suggestions? What is the best spot to attach it? Still on the bow like a regular fishing boat? I also have a Hummingbird fish finder that we're going to put on, where should I mount the transducer? Thanks in advance!!"
974963,Tom McCutcheon,2016-06-27 16:09:00,627,"you will have better controll of the boat when mounted at the bow.  Do you wish to use the hummingbird strictly while using the trolling motor? If so, you can mount the transducer to the prop housing with a large hose clamp. If not, then the best place is on the stern end of one of the pontoons."
974973,chris.brock,2016-06-27 17:44:00,4053, I would bow mount the trolling motor. My pontoon has a plate on the back of one of the pontoons I assume for mounting a transducer. Maybe your cousins has the same thing.
974974,grimsbylander,2016-06-27 17:49:00,3016,"Mount it where you have the most room to stand/cast. The bow is the best but if the layout is not accommodating to fishing and easy access to rods and tackle, it's not the best location for that application."
974976,adam lancia,2016-06-27 18:00:00,234,"Thanks guys! I'll get him to check the back of the pontoons. He'll probably use it for trolling with the outboard idling in gear for lake trout so he probably won't have the electric trolling motor in then.  There is about a 2 foot front deck across the width of the boat but I'd say we do most of not all of our casting from whichever part of the boat is facing out target, lol! I suppose we would cast from the front and/or sides once we are able to keep the nose pointed where we want to. ideally, I'd like to get one with the remote foot pedal. Used is fine so what would you suggest? Thanks!"
974987,Tom McCutcheon,2016-06-27 19:48:00,627,"Go with the maximum amount of thrust you can afford, (minimum 60), you need to remember that a pontoon boat is like a huge sail when it comes to wind and current. You may also wish to discuss 12 volt or 24 volt and shaft length.

974990,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-27 20:04:00,8243,I agree with everything Tom has said above. Those pontoon boats look a lot heavier than a typical small boat of the same length. Find out the weight of that boat before going out and spending money on a electric that won't move it well. And like Tom said mount the transducer to the motor of the electric.
975003,Raycaster,2016-06-27 21:01:00,528,"I just happen to have a 16' pontoon and just installed a 80 Terrova iPilot US2 on the front.  I've used it one weekend solid and it worked great. Its quieter than I thought and the 2 batteries (27) lasted 3 long days without a recharge (although should be charged daily).  3 problems (no fault of Minn Kota)  The mk-23 Minn Kota quick release plate. The concept is great but the holes are tough to line up with the floor carpet making it .0001% unflat. Had to modify my front pontoon gate and have to figure out a water guard when the gates open. The top speed is slightly slow for trolling for musky.  BTW, the Terrova I purchased also has the Universal Sonar so that would take care of your transducer install."

And like Tom said mount the transducer to the motor of the electric.  That's good info guys. I will assume torque and load (and battery drain) are all influenced by the choice of voltage, correct? More voltage = more torque at lower load (to the batterie in terms of amperage) which should result in longer battery life. Do I have that right or am I out in left field?  I haven't the slightest about shaft length though, I could use a crash course on that.  I'll get my cousin to check how hefty his boat is. I want to go used if possible, only to keep the cost down and to see if he likes it enough to look for a new one. Of course we have dreams of GPS spot lock and dual motors (front and back) dancing in our heads but that's neither here nor there right now...  Thanks!!"
975011,Tom McCutcheon,2016-06-27 22:05:00,627,"For shaft length, take a measurement from the deck of the boat where the motor will be installed to the surface of the water. The motors are adjustable for height but you want the prop housing and prop to be at least a foot and a half below the water surface at a minimum. When it is rolling with waves or wake, the prop will come out of the water and you will lose propulsion. 24 volts will give you..., Tim Allan's....MORE POWER....AARRGGHH....AARRGGHH...AARRGGHH"

I thought I was onto something there. Are there any longevity benefits from higher voltage, since I would assume the motor needs to draw fewer amps to make the same power since there's more voltage available...?  Will check the deck height, thanks!"
975024,Tom McCutcheon,2016-06-27 23:03:00,627,"You were close....That all depends on how long you use the motor on Full Power. Generally speaking, 24 volts will give you twice the amount of run time as a 12 volt system if the same speed is maintained on both systems IE: 24 volt is doing 4 MPH and 12 volt is doing 4 MPH, and batteries are of equal size and capacity."

Will check the deck height, thanks!  Yes, a 36 volt system will draw fewer amps than a 24 volt system which draws fewer amps than a 12 volt system.  So you should get longer battery life in addition to extra power.  At a given thrust, the draw would be inversley proportional to the voltage.  A 12v motor gives you 1 pound to thrust per amp of current.  A 24v motor will give you 2 pounds and 36v will give you 3 pounds.  If weight and space is not a problem I would get a 36v system.  If not then 24v is better than 12v."

If you are fishing in windy conditions than the surface area exposed to the wind will probably be a bigger factor than the weight."
975064,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-28 14:04:00,8243,"Yep there is a lot of stuff sticking out of the water on a pontoon boat. It will act like a sail in the wind, you know that already. There are 36 and 48V motors avail as well as electric thrust motors that are married to the gas engine. No they aren't cheap though.  Personally I would stay away from buying used for many reasons unless the seller is willing to give a written guarantee."
