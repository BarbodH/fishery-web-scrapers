974274,Tjames09,2016-06-20 14:22:00,664,"In the summer spend a fair bit of time on Lake Sturgeon as my in-laws live on the lake. Trouble is they don't have a fishing boat, just a large pontoon, which is great for group outings, but not good for fishing.  Was wondering if there are any places that rent fishing boats for the day or weekend in the area."
974275,Sinker,2016-06-20 14:28:00,8692,What part of the lake are you on? There are a couple that I know of.  S.
974294,Tjames09,2016-06-20 17:56:00,664,"What part of the lake are you on? There are a couple that I know of.  S.  South end, on the river, near Lindsay. On the west side of the lake/river."

974365,Tjames09,2016-06-21 02:24:00,664,"What is Surgeon like to fish? Is it a good bass lake by chance?  I find it gets hit hard for bass fishing and anytime I've gone out my luck is low for bass, but Im also fishing on a  massive pontoon boat and fish wherever the boat is, not key locations."

Gotcha, thanks. Hard hit or not, catching a few would be better than not getting out at all!"

974513,Sinker,2016-06-22 10:24:00,8692,"The others i know of are in the north end, but im not sure if the marina at long beach has rentals or not."
974574,sofabed,2016-06-23 00:36:00,119,You could try Rosedale Marina. They rent boats but they are north of Fenelon Falls
974609,Steve,2016-06-23 14:26:00,2075,120-150 a day is normal for a boat rental.  not many at 100 or under.
974610,AKRISONER,2016-06-23 14:38:00,5558,i find it hard to believe that you could have trouble catching bass on any of the kawartha lakes. but maybe ive just fished with people that know the water.  I know on buckhorn/pigeon...50+ fish days is the norm.
974611,Dutch01,2016-06-23 14:57:00,1431,You could always try Sunrise Cottages on Lower Buck www.sunriseresort.ca.  Last time I rented there was under the old owner Cees. It was 96.00 tax and gas in for a 14 foot tinner. I'm not sure if it's gone up under the new owner.
974750,dave524,2016-06-24 21:44:00,4508,"120-150 a day is normal for a boat rental.  not many at 100 or under.  Dad had a green Johnson 5 1/2, as a kid we'd go to Ray's Boat Livery in Port Colborne and rent a 16 cedar strip Powasson. Ray Prophet was an American from Florida and wore one of those hats just like skipper in Gilligan's Island , going rate back in the late 50's was 50 cents an hour or $3 for the day"
974770,GBW,2016-06-25 01:27:00,8460,"Let's say you rent one every other weekend.  $300 x 8 weekends over 2 years time frame = $2,400 you could have spent on a ""car topper"" size used boat and motor.  Just something to consider if you have a truck/car/van/suv that can tow one or put on the roof..."
974772,GBW,2016-06-25 02:06:00,8460,Just adding to my last idea...  This seller has a few listed too. http://www.kijiji.ca/v-powerboat-motorboat/kawartha-lakes/14-aluminum-harber-reynolds-boat-and-trailer-rated-for-a-25-hp/1176602700?enableSearchNavigationFlag=true
974791,Rizzo,2016-06-25 13:12:00,4754,I would imagine those rentals are just tin cans. I bet you could buy a reliable tinny with a decent engine for 2k and just leave it at their place. When you find the real boat you want sell the tinny and get your 2k back. Better yet..have them buy the tinny. Everybody needs a runabout!
