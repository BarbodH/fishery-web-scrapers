973795,AKRISONER,2016-06-15 18:05:00,5558,After a day of tossing big streamers my shoulder can get pretty sore.   Gotta hit the gym more.  This...Just spent my first full fishing day on the fly on sunday and my bicep was toast
973861,mike rousseau,2016-06-16 00:49:00,4661,I'll try voltaten thanks  I have no issues wearing the arm band whever I fish... Just another tan line for others to point out... Lol  What I feel did me in was while trolling rod in hand with cranks and if you get a little weed you snap your rod really hard to shake/break it off... I do that a hundred times a day not to mention hook sets on fish....  Hopefully I can control it going foreword...  Might have to do more perch fishing loo
973889,Garnet,2016-06-16 11:35:00,2056,I'm smiling because I'm seating reading ont fishing with my arm bans on. WHY YOU SAY  My no pay volunteer job today is take bricks off my over loaded half ton. I did the math every brick is 7 lb and I'm 1806 lbs.  I wear these sh...t arm bans doing anything physical because fri and sat I'm pike fishing..............
973892,fish_fishburn,2016-06-16 12:02:00,1311,There is no magic pill. You guys really need to change your diets.

973947,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-16 20:06:00,8243,"Medicinal frozen Corn, I like Peas myself, really helps during flare ups. The only thing that sets it off now is swinging a framing hammer of which I never ever intend on doing for the rest of my entire life. That's what 18V drills and screws are for. Work smart not physically hard.   Garnet you are going to kill your 1/2 ton with loads like that, been there done that and have the T Shirt."
973956,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-16 20:49:00,10439,"That's what 18V drills and screws are for. Work smart not physically hard.   I use a 20V 1/4"" impact driver. Way better than drills. I have no idea how we ever built stuff before they were invented."
973964,SuperDave,2016-06-16 21:44:00,204,"Been through it myself. And ive never had a tough construction job. I believe it is caused by repetitive motion. Whether you stack bricks, stock shelves, cut hair, rake lawns, install windows.... your going to experience this sometime in your life. I found icing it was good. I also started taking glucosamine/chondroitin for joint pain and that really helped. Exercise is good but if you go to the gym and pump iron it will only get worse. Mine hasn't flared up in a long time, knock on wood. People who don't fish, don't realize how hard it is on our bodies."
974158,Smokercrafty,2016-06-19 00:58:00,227,"......it all flares up whn im fishing but the show must go on.....  Very well put buddy! We all have our aches and pains, plus ways to deal with them, but ultimately, when you're washing lures, nothing hurts!"
974165,pics,2016-06-19 11:30:00,1268,Lots of aches and pains from physical labor but it's nothing compared to having to deal with Vertigo. Sitting in a boat that's slightly moving but feeling as if you are in the perfect storm...that sucks..
974205,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-19 19:32:00,8243,"Featherstone Ted is dealing with Verigo right now. He can't even stand some days let alone fish. Normally he would have been out in the boat every other day since April plus a week at Quinte, not out once this year. Not good at all. I empathize pics."
974447,ichan,2016-06-21 19:26:00,8,"had elbow problem, hand and fingers used to lock up when swing jigs, had to switch half my reels to lefties, learn to swing with my other arm, no more passing the rod and reel to the other hand after a cast, problem solved"

974590,Shloim,2016-06-23 11:37:00,515,Usually its my pride that hurts the most after a day of fishing....
974733,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2016-06-24 18:27:00,535,It's my savings account that hurts the most when I fish.
974736,Dutch01,2016-06-24 19:59:00,1431,Ain't that the truth! Mines more of a spending account than a saving account 0.o
973689,mike rousseau,2016-06-15 00:33:00,4661,Well at the ripe old age if 31 I may have developed tendonitis through the repetitive  movements of fishing (till the day I die I'll say it's cause the fish I catch are too big lol)  Self diagnosed bit I'm calling the doctor tomorrow for an appointment...  Anyone else develope any injuries like this?  Were you able to figure out a solution?  Mike
973694,landry,2016-06-15 00:38:00,1005,You might just fish too much. No. That can't be possible.
973695,landry,2016-06-15 00:38:00,1005,Try active release massage therapy. It is like magic. Everyone who takes my advice on this has thanked me later.
973696,DRIFTER_016,2016-06-15 00:38:00,10439,"Back, knees shoulder and elbows are all toast. Not all fishing related but they effect my enjoyment of the passion. Back, shoulder and knees are helped with Aleve and the elbows with elbow braces. If you have wrist issues look into a brace for it."
973698,spincast,2016-06-15 00:40:00,3279,"lost more than one large salmon to it.   15 years as a mover did a nice job on hands, elbows and shoulders.Sometimes the hands go numb,and loose all strength.  Cant drive a tiller because it either.   Exercise and being aware is what I have chosen. Some things I just can't do anymore."
973701,MJL,2016-06-15 00:45:00,2427,I got tennis elbow a few years ago after 2 straight days of ripping bucktails for walleyes. Really painful. A week of rest and icing it whenever I could really helped. It cleared itself in about 5 days. That's the only fishing related issue I've had.
973704,Fisherman,2016-06-15 00:48:00,7201,I'm thinking there may be another sport involved.  Magazine in one hand and you figure out the rest.
973707,mike rousseau,2016-06-15 01:04:00,4661,Lmao!!!!
973710,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 01:15:00,11391,I developed a cyst in my wrist from fishing(not the other self gratification?)  And tennis elbow from golfing and playing tennis???

973720,npt1,2016-06-15 01:49:00,220,"lol,  Like Fisherman said,  lol.  I hope your first self winding watch was worn on your right wrist---- it will run forever.  lol"
973727,Pigeontroller,2016-06-15 03:05:00,2793,"You think fishing is tough, try construction work!"
973728,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 03:14:00,11391,"You think construction is tough, try the oilfield/pipline/ironmakers/mining  Or being a mcdonalds employee lol"
973729,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-15 03:20:00,8243,I did develop tendinitis in both elbows from trolling in fast water on the Ottawa. A tension band helps when it flares up. The Dr. definitely related it to fishing. He wouldn't give me a script for a rod holder or downrigger like I asked. It flares up when swinging a hammer and too much golfing. It never goes away vompletely. Try Voltaren it does help.
973737,Garnet,2016-06-15 09:40:00,2056,"My first run at tendinitis 1990 so bad my tournament partner would pry my hand open after 9am to set hook.  Like everybody I thought just wear the arm bands when it starts to get sore. ""WRONG"" don't let them get sore. I have a pair of arm bands in the boat, in the truck, several in the house. If I'm doing any activity they are on my arms.  My plan pays partly so I get a pair every year.  And have a professional show how to wear them. Tight is not right. Every year I show somebody, MOST DON'T LISTEN."
973738,wallyboss,2016-06-15 11:16:00,1095,"Ice it up 20 minutes at a time and don't move it for 10 minutes after taking the ice off.   Tendinitis where?  I had tennis elbow (top of elbow) for 2 years but found a way to work just by adjusting the position of my elbow, worked okay for a while but ended up with golfer's elbow(bottom of the elbow) ,  worse thing I did was try cortisone shots.  it was great no pain for 3 months but when it came back I could hardly use my elbow.  Good luck!!"
973739,Fishwilly,2016-06-15 11:22:00,206,Start trolling on lake O. Only challenge will be reeling in the big ones. Just pass the rod to me lol
973741,woodenboater,2016-06-15 11:40:00,2277,"yup. been there, got the t-shirt. sloppy technique/ form casting pike flies. brutal, took a while to recover fully. I'd think stretching before and after a long day on the water is a good self care regimen."
973742,fishindevil,2016-06-15 11:43:00,6254,"yup30yrs of pulling cannonballs up and down on lake Ontario,as well as fighting thousands of salmon,major aches and pains...as well as regular fishing and being in the boat for up too 15hrs at a time....it goes on and on plus 3 back surgeries......it all flares up whn im fishing but the show must go on....."
973744,aplumma,2016-06-15 12:02:00,6896,"Control the inflammation is the key with stretching, advil,rest and external support. Masking the pain will just allow you to damage it more without knowing it.   Art"
973763,jimmer,2016-06-15 14:41:00,2730,"Construction, manufacturing, fishing and hunting = bad everything for me. I don't let it stop me from going fishing though. Physio, stretching, pain killers and determination."
973770,AKRISONER,2016-06-15 15:51:00,5558,"fishing musky for 12 hours with blades is probably one of the most painful experiences I have ever had doing something enjoyable lol  keep your body in good shape, eat right and excercise and many of these problems fix themselves...easier said than done though."
973771,BillM,2016-06-15 15:55:00,17367,After a day of tossing big streamers my shoulder can get pretty sore.   Gotta hit the gym more.
973784,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-15 17:06:00,8243,"When we were young and fit we would start doing more aerobic work in the winter to prepare to bushwack fish for Trout in the back woods of Orangeville and Varney area, I called it Viet Nam. The same when we portaged beaver dams with 14' tinnies, 9.9's gas and tackle up in the Long Lac area. I stopped doing that because it just wasn't physically possible. Fitness is important even for a ""non physical"" activity as fishing."
973790,manitoubass2,2016-06-15 17:27:00,11391,"Oh my I miss those trips, and hate them at the same time lol.  I always got stuck carrying the motor, always.  But getting into some of those lakes sure made alot of great memories.  Our last trip I just posted about, my pops was talking about buting a 12 or 14 footer.  So I have a feeling more of these trips are planned.  So Ive got time to convince him that paddles work well lol"
