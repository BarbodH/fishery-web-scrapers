I never actually target bass actively, does anyone know some goods spots on Nipissing for them, preferably near Callander?  I will do you a favor and eat them to boot."
975068,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-28 14:59:00,8243,"In my experience there find a nice cove with pencil reed and you may find largemouth, find a shoal of which there are plenty and you will be onto some nice Smallies. We really never targeted Bass when we had the cottage there, it was all Walleye and Perch fishing and Bass were considered a nuisance fish."
975074,Garnet,2016-06-28 15:38:00,2056,"just look at the first shore line standard stuff. Tube, popper,jerkbait spinnerbait. Fished Calendar a lot shouldn't be hard."
975076,Rod Caster,2016-06-28 16:00:00,5784,"Near Callander? Have you considered Callander Bay?  :whistling:  All jokes aside, if I were to bass fishing around here, I'd be going to one of the many surrounding lakes that are stacked with bass and rarely get fished. Not all, but many of them have decent launches for small-mid sized boats"
975083,davis,2016-06-28 18:11:00,128,during our walleye trips we've caught many monster SM (incidental) in and around the mouth of South River. they may move off those areas later in the season. South River is not too far a scoot from Callendar if you have the right boat for it.
