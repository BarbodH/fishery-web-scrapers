974415,cheaptackle,2016-06-21 14:17:00,849,"Got home around 3:00 yesterday afternoon and shortly after there was a very loud and repeated racket caused by aircraft on Lake St. John.  Looking out I was soon able to count 3 pontoon style and 1 airboat style bright yellow planes repeatedly taking off and landing, not getting much altitude. I ran the registration on two of them (internet CAN be informative) and found they were MNR waterbombers.  Because the cycle time of take off and land was so short I figured it was just an exercise. After listening for 4 hours and seeing this fascinating event continue, I email my buddy in the MNR to ask what might be happening.  Shortly after I sent this email, the following showed up:  http://www.orilliapacket.com/2016/06/20/wind-heat-fuel-brush-fire-in-ramara-township  Hope there were no injuries or losses!  Michael"
