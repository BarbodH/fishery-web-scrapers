974617,PUMP KNOWS,2016-06-23 17:23:00,937,Say hello to my first Muskie!  We were targeting walleye and this beast smashed my Livetarget jointed smelt.      
974618,GBW,2016-06-23 17:25:00,8460,congrats
974619,Steve,2016-06-23 17:26:00,2075,"always change up your hooks and split rings with any Live Target bait if your going to chase fish that actually pull (ie, pike, muskie, salmon, trout, etc).  Super nice fish!!!"
974623,dave524,2016-06-23 18:02:00,4508,nice fish for your first
974626,leaf4,2016-06-23 18:41:00,2466,Niiiice!

974653,PUMP KNOWS,2016-06-23 21:51:00,937,"Thanks guys!   always change up your hooks and split rings with any Live Target bait if your going to chase fish that actually pull (ie, pike, muskie, salmon, trout, etc).  Super nice fish!!!  I don't fish with Livetarget much but I guess they're the same as Rapala.    so are you addicted now?   It was a bad ass fight but I wish I could've seen the jumps, It jumped multiple times.  I hope to slowly get a musky setup by next year."
