974729,AKRISONER,2016-06-24 18:09:00,5558," 18-22inches for the most part.  same here...the odd time when im an idiot it will run up into the top rung, but thats rare.  I also fish with 100 dollar rods, not 500 so maybe thats a point of consideration?"
974731,John Bacon,2016-06-24 18:16:00,3277," I don't reel the swivel through the guides, ever...  There was a seminar on salmon fishing a couple of nights ago.  One of the recommendations was to use a swivel when attaching copper to braid.  If you did that to attach copper to braid backing then it would need to go through the guides and on to the reel.  That is what promted by question."
974734,bare foot wader,2016-06-24 19:06:00,1354,"I use those raven swivels quite a bit, but I stopped using them for braid-leader connections....even with shorter leaders I've still reeled up once in a blue moon, and have damaged 3 tip top guides since I first started using braid way back when...pretty much only when drop shotting now, and sometimes trolling  I generally prefer to use an 8-12 wrap improved Albright depending on lb test"
974735,John Bacon,2016-06-24 19:30:00,3277,"Does anyone use a swivel between copper and braid?  Or, just tied directly?"

If you did that to attach copper to braid backing then it would need to go through the guides and on to the reel.  That is what promted by question.  I wouldn't use a swivel like this on a copper setup (Would you even use a swivel?)
974753,John Bacon,2016-06-24 22:23:00,3277," (Would you even use a swivel?)  Not before seeing the on-line seminar on Wednesday evening  He claimed that tieing directly to braid would cut the line.  I am not sure if he meant when tie to the leader, to the backing, or both.  I guess it can't be too big of a problem if nobody else has ever heard of doing that."
974756,misfish,2016-06-24 22:33:00,29133,"Thew only swivel I use now when steel heading .      Anything else, I tie direct."
974569,TJames,2016-06-23 00:01:00,11,"I'm tying two of my rods both braid to swivels and I tied both with Palamor knots, just wondering if that's what most people prefer?"
974570,chris.brock,2016-06-23 00:05:00,4053," That's what I use, and the double uni for braid to flouro"
974573,TJames,2016-06-23 00:20:00,11,Thanks! Ya I tied a double uni for my braid to floro.
974576,kickingfrog,2016-06-23 01:03:00,8333,And wet the braid before tightening the knot.
974577,ecmilley,2016-06-23 01:21:00,2163,I use a blood knot for the braid to flour connection And Palomar for all things braid
974580,adempsey,2016-06-23 01:46:00,1498,"The rare occasion I tied braid directly to anything was with a palomar, improved clinch or Rapala knot.   Not something I would normally do though, it's easier to work with a leader.   Even if it's a piece of mono.  I usually use a uni-uni to tie the leader to braid, but I've used the reverse albright as well."

974599,SirCranksalot,2016-06-23 13:13:00,3291,"Palomar is my std for tying hooks, snap swivels etc.  I use the blood knot sometimes for line-to-line but I find they tend to slip if I'm not real careful with the tying. Always do a good test after tying. I sometimes use micro-swivels but if I want to use a long leader on my spinng rod I use a blood knot----don't want the swivel passing thru the top eye! Have done that by accident and it's not pretty."
974602,Steve,2016-06-23 13:26:00,2075,"aaron shirley showed me the surgeons knot to connect braid to flouro lead (name sounds hard, easiest knot on the planet to tie) many years ago.  I use this knot for ALL my King Salmon needs....it doesn't break....and it's SO EASY to tie.  Check it out"
974606,FrankTheRabbit,2016-06-23 13:56:00,479,"Some great knot suggestions connecting braid with leaders. Good tip on the swivels or snap swivels. So key when tossing any kind of spoons or spinners, especially with mono. Line twists sucks and can give nightmares on spinning gear.  I had so much line twist on a spinning reel that when I opened the bail, all this mono just jumped off the spool lol. Cursing ensued for being lazy and not tying on a swivel. Lesson learned."

974677,backbay,2016-06-24 00:53:00,773,i use a palomar for tying pretty much anything to terminal tackle and an albright for flouro to braid and that sort of thing.

974698,AKRISONER,2016-06-24 12:57:00,5558," How well do they stand up to a big Chinook? choose your size according to the weight that you are pulling. I think the xxs is rated to 20lbs (correct me if im wrong)  so far in 2 years of using them on almost every single rod and line I am tossing, i have broken 1."
974706,BillM,2016-06-24 13:16:00,17367, How well do they stand up to a big Chinook?  No issues landing big boots on giant skien chunks in the late summer on the float setup.
