973935,Dutch01,2016-06-16 17:33:00,1431,I agree that the internet is a poor forum for consensus. I accept your apology and offer my own in return. It appears I inferred a meaning that you did not imply
973936,Dara,2016-06-16 17:45:00,3052,"All good points. I don't disagree with you, addressing a lack of mental health care funding would go a long way towards curbing these mass shootings. Probably further than gun control. But Americans are afraid of ""socialism"" so I don't see them doing anything about metal illness anytime soon.  I happen to also think that more stringent background checks could augment mental health treatment as a part of a holistic solution.  I'm not against a guy like Art having as many guns as he wants. I get that there are many many law abiding citizens who will never use their guns in anger. However, I refuse to believe we can plan to fly men to Mars, but we lack the collective intelligence to stop (or at least diminish) these mass shooting events.  The fact that Republicans can't even have a conversation about curbing mass shootings without accusing everyone else of sedition should be a source of shame.   So, you're not against more stringent background checks...is that all you got?"
973938,Dutch01,2016-06-16 18:08:00,1431," I love this. If don't have ALL the ideas and ALL the solutions, that's somehow a failing because I've ""only"" put forth one idea.

I guess you do, because a person who wants to get drugs will just do them anyways, so there is no point in enforcement at all.  i think the large majority of us would agree that heroine and crack should be illegal."

I jumped up and said ""they can?"" A Republican big wig spokesman basically said that was unconstitutional. They can't even agree with themselves.  I couldn't even hire an employee if they could not get a clear Criminal Clearance Check here to sub contract work to Home Depot, they had the same policy for HD in the US. But they would be eligible to buy a weapon down there."

973828,aplumma,2016-06-15 20:38:00,6896,"First, we can't talk about how to achieve something without first agreeing we want to achieve it. So far, I don't hear any Republicans saying there's even a problem.  Second, I am not an expert on gun control or public policy. I recognize this and defer to those with more experience. Perhaps an expanded background check system would help. Perhaps we need to go further. But we can't even discuss options because Republicans have their fingers in their ears while singing Mary had a little lamb.  In my opinion doing nothing is not an option unless you actually want more massacres. And in my opinion, the rights of the 49 not to be murdered outweigh the rights of Mateen to have guns. So if you're going to err, I would suggest it's better to err on the side of the victims than the perp. You are not erroring on 1 person you are erroring on every single person in the legal system. He is by definition at the time was a suspect not a felon when he bought the gun. I can make you a suspect with a phone call unfounded or not. I am not happy he got the guns I wish he did not get a gun but so far no one has come up with a viable solution either here on OFC or the whole United States. I personally think a unicorn will be found first.   Art"
973831,Dutch01,2016-06-15 20:53:00,1431," As for your analogy, you are right but if we say it's the rights of all gun owners not just Mateen, then it's not just versus the 49. It's gun owners versus the 33,000 Americans killed by guns every year.  Let's talk rights. The Declaration of Independence provides American citizens with the inalienable right to Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  ""We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal & independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness;""  Over 11,000 people are murdered with guns every year in the USA. Those people were deprived of their right to live. Are their rights less important than your Second Amendment rights?  I ask this out of a sincere desire to understand the reasoning behind your opinion. I am not trying to single you out or pick on you in particular. You have stood your ground and argued your opinion rather eloquently. Even if I disagree with your conclusions, I respect that."
973832,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-15 20:57:00,8243,"My mid west {southern Illinois} far right wing GOP member Conservative, carries Ronald Reagan's photo in his wallet, Bible toting, gun toting, NRA representative fantastic Uncle that I love dearly once asked me to look at what was in his glove compartment. I may have told this story before. I asked ""Zio, what is this?"" as I looked at this beautiful Glock with a Laser sight. ""Well Napute, that's my Can gun. You know for Mexican's, Jamaican's, Porto Rican's.""  And he is proud to spew what I believe to be evil. Even tough I love him dearly talking to him is like talking to an Alien from a different planet as compared to talking to Canadians. This is a person whom someone is going to have to pry his guns from his cold dead hands. This issue of who, what, when, where and why someone is going to dictate to a high percentage of the American public what weapons they can or can not own will not be settled in the next 100 years and certainly not on a internet fishing forum even though it is interesting to say the least.  Please keep in mind all of the victims that have lost their lives and the countless people this tragedy has effected for the rest of their lives. Cheap jokes and nit picking does not shed a good light on ones character here and am very surprised at some members out of character comments, not good guys."
973835,tomkat,2016-06-15 21:13:00,246,Let's face it nothing will ever change down there. Start the countdown till the next mass shooting. Millions of those weapons in the hands of sane responsible gun owners until they aren't.

I ask this out of a sincere desire to understand the reasoning behind your opinion. I am not trying to single you out or pick on you in particular. You have stood your ground and argued your opinion rather eloquently. Even if I disagree with your conclusions, I respect that. The root of my opinions is justice or the rights of people to be innocent before being guilty. As you read further into it is the right to justice to be considered innocent until proven guilty. If he had not died then he would face the justice system that would have been found by his peers either guilty or innocent and while it does not bring back the dead it would be justice. We are still at the point of lets say tomorrow all guns are illegal (can't happen) but now that with a wish and a wave of the wand no new guns are made. Every law abiding person turned theirs in now who still has guns? Well half of the law abiding citizens will and all of the criminals will be armed. Now that you know before hand that guns have disappeared in the US and you want to be a terrorist you will either bring your own or find a bad guy who will sell you his. You have a better chance of outlawing cars that pollute and kill before guns will disappear.  There is nothing that guarantees the right for people to have access to alcohol. The number of deaths has to be higher than 11,000 people between medical deaths, car accidents, over indulging, and poor judgment. No one will outlaw alcohol because 51% of people want it. The penalty to non drinkers or rational drinkers is extensive financial burdens especially in Canada with the government  collecting huge amounts of taxes to cover it. Ask yourself will alcohol be outlawed for the good of the public in Canada? (rhetorical) Is it possible ? {Think prohibition in the US}  All nations have issues that are unsolvable ours is guns since Canadians know the ins and outs of Canada I think it is better for you to name your secret poison.  Just to reiterate I am not happy with the way guns are regulatedto give you an insight into my mind, I took an oath when I joined the Navy   ""I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.""  I still believe in those words to fight for freedom of the oppressed to be guided by the laws of the country to enforce the written laws put before me by my superiors. The law is the point change the law legally in a manner that the citizens have voted in then all of my guns or alcohol or whatever the people decide will be followed. The new health care system in the US is so wrong on so many levels (which I will NOT answer or debate)BUT was voted in by the masses so I abide by it. I as you all are doing here in a polite and thoughtful way (thank you) will be doing my darndest  to eliminate what I see as a major flaw in our system.  Art"

You are basically implying ""if you are against a gun ban, you actually want more massacres"". It's a very cheap approach to arguing and, unfortunately, it's being used way too often.  I assure you, no one on this board wants more massacres. Some of us, however, think that doing stupid expensive things that will achieve very little besides making a large part of population angry is stupid.  Think long gun registry in Canada. This is the kind of stupid populist solutions that don't really solve anything except wasting money and delusion people into thinking all is well now, our government is on top of things.  As far as I see, on this board, your opponents don't say ""Nothing needs to be done, everything is peachy"". They say ""Something needs to be done but we haven't seen anything effective and thoughtful proposed so far"".  But hey, who cares about thinking. Let's just keep repeating ""Strict gun control laws will prevent mass shootings"". Like they prevented Toronto Eaton Center shooting in 2012 or Norway shooting in 2011."

It has nothing to do with Americans being afraid and socialism.  Talking about mental health, hate crimes, etc. doesn't win any votes. Talking about guns does, doesn't matter if it's pro- or against.

I'm hearing ""I don't like your ideas so I will attack you as a traitor to the Constitution"".  You're obviously hearing something different.  That you reference shootings in Canada is laughable.

He's divorced, and they typically interview former spouses. She had said he was mentally ill, violent and abusive. That's not likely to get him a pass.   They ask if you are divorced and they also ask if you have had any breakups lately. If you say yes to the divorce it rests on the ex to ban you from having guns. His wife says he was nuts now but would she have when he applied for a PAL, and they last 5 years, when was his divorce. There is no Doctor check, they can't ask for medical records. I actually think that in Canada it's easier to buy a gun...no waiting/cooling off period either. Once you have a PAL, you have it.  My daughter just got her handgun license and they never called her Dad or Mom to ask about any problems, neither with the PAL"
973814,jedimaster,2016-06-15 19:26:00,3472,"The part that everyone seems to be missing is this simple fact. There are lots of firearms banned in the US already. There are also restrictions placed on firearms here in Canada. Some more so and some less. Yes Canada allows some firearms that the US does not. Believe it or not. When civilians kill someone with as firearm its either pre meditated, planned, thought about, devised, locations, times equipment etc... or its just a person gone off there rocker in a knee jerk situation like a domestic, fight on the street for no apparent reason etc.. This incident clearly falls into the first category. He went shopping, scoped the place out, bought body armour etc etc.. Anyone that is hell bent on killing people weather or not they are banned from buying a firearm legally can still in ANY country buy one with enough cash. It doesn't matter if you want a pistol or semi automatic rifle you can buy one. However lets just suppose that this psycho couldn't buy one. Then what? He just gives up and calls it a day flips on the TV and watches re runs of Full House? No he is going to go on google and figure out how to make a few pipe bombs, or maybe steal a bull dozer, or a cube van full of fertilizer or who the heck knows what. It is such an ill thought knee jerk reaction after a shooting to say lets ban all the guns because that will prevent people from dying at the hands of a psycho. Yes there should better checks in place to prevent people that shouldn't have guns from getting them. But to ban them from people who go about there day legally without ever killing anyone is a bit retarded in my opinion.  The things that should be focused on right now in my eyes are support for those that lost family, those still injured, the background checks should be reviewed, his WIFE put in the slammer for a long time and education and funding put into mental health. That's just my opinion though."
973815,Hedfish,2016-06-15 19:31:00,76,"All of you saying ""no, he shouldn't have been able to buy a gun"" do it armed with the post factum knowledge.  No reasonable background check would have found anything wrong with the guy prior to the shooting. As far as I know, he was never charged with abuse, he was never admitted in a mental institution, he had no criminal record. ""Was investigated in connection to..."" sounds scary after the shooting, in reality it probably means that he was a friend of a friend of a relative of some guy suspected to be a terrorist.  Probably a lot of people that migrated from Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, etc. can be (and have been) investigated in connection to terrorists, it doesn't mean all of them should be banned from certain things.  That's the problem with most of the shooters - they seem completely normal prior to shootings.  I am not saying background checks are completely useless - at the very least they can catch the most obvious cases - but don't expect miracles. Canadian PAL procedures are a good example - they wouldn't catch this guy either. Any ""real"" background check would take so much time and resources, you would wait years for your PAL license."
973816,Dara,2016-06-15 19:38:00,3052,"Exactly.  We should maybe be a bit better at turning in our friends when they seem to be going off but who can tell.  How many people that know of a friend that commits suicide says..yeah, I saw that coming."

For a lot of communities, government/police is an outsider and is considered an enemy. There is no way they would report ""one of theirs"".  Another problem, do you think police doesn't get enough tips from nutjobs like ""I think my neighbor is Osama Bin Laden""? Again, it's all about time and resources. There is no way to adequately investigate all leads, so asking for more is kind of pointless."

973826,Dutch01,2016-06-15 20:29:00,1431," Second, I am not an expert on gun control or public policy. I recognize this and defer to those with more experience. Perhaps an expanded background check system would help. Perhaps we need to go further. But we can't even discuss options because Republicans have their fingers in their ears while singing Mary had a little lamb.  In my opinion doing nothing is not an option unless you actually want more massacres. And in my opinion, the rights of the 49 not to be murdered outweigh the rights of Mateen to have guns. So if you're going to err, I would suggest it's better to err on the side of the victims than the perp."

It took me awhile to get used to  dropping a couple hundred bucks to make holes in paper and loud noises for practice. It however is the only way I have the confidence that I am a responsible gun owner and an excellent shot.

Does that mean I should be able to own a working Abrams Tank with all ordinance or a Stealth Fighter or two?  In my opinion there is no reason whatsoever for anyone to own an assault rifle.

A few times I pretty much went through a caseguard of 60 .220 Swift rounds groundhog shooting and way back when you could still go to the dump ( don't think the term sanitary land fill site had been invented yet ) and shoot rats I'm sure I've gone through a couple of boxes of 50 22 Long Rifle hollowpoints.

Tell me about it, shot all 4 gauges of skeet back in the 70's early 80's, had a bench with Mec 600 loaders in 12, 20, 28 and .410. There was a real saving in loading your own back then, when I got my first 12 gauge loader it was 1967 and Red Dot powder was $3 a pound and shot $7 for a 25 pound bag, now there is no savings in target loads if you buy a case. The examples I gave earlier were actual hunting situations."

It's got nothing to do with freedom or the ridiculous notion of overthrowing an oppressive government. If you allow enough people to own assault rifles every once in a while a bunch of innocent people will lose their lives and families will be devastated. And all the idiotic arguments about banning cars and screwdrivers and knives and hammers come up and home defense blah blah blah. Watch Jim Jeffries stand up routine on gun control it outlines how Idiotic the whole argument is quite nicely.  First off to refer to ALL people who own guns as clowns removes all validity to your statement. Your slanted views and prejudism of something that you are not entitled to reek of either jealousy or you are trolling this forum. One will get you laughed at and the other will get you the scorn of the people on the forum. Please put more thought and be more careful with you wording. By the logic being spouted by our friends here, from south of the border, they had better start updating the arsenal as I am sure that their government is constantly upgrading their arsenal. How on earth will you be able to fight your government, defend your rights, if the government has better guns then the public? I'm starting to feel like I should not be feeling bad for the victims of this horrific event, but for all Americans who are being forced to live in a place where there is no right to live, just the right to defend. HH I do not believe that the average citizen is afraid the government is outpacing the masses with their arms available. The right to arms is and always has been to protect our shores from internal and external threats which is any armed force/person not just the government. We have to date militia that are still part of our culture and it has a value that some can not understand today but it was the reason we have our freedom in the past. The reason to live is the freedom you enjoy if you are in a place you are unhappy then it is not truly a good life.  I'm weighing in on this now only because of HH's comment. As Canadians, we cannot truly comprehend the depth of the gun culture in the US. Just as they cannot understand our aversion to it. This is because as HH illustrated, we view it from opposite angles. They see gun ownership as a right, as a basic need for life; food, shelter, security. We see it as something that erodes our security. My work involves the small arms industry in Canada and the US. For perspective, I can confirm that one of the well known US firearms manufacturers produces 30,000 guns per MONTH. That's one manufacturer. In contrast, a top 3 Canadian manufacturer is about 6,000 per YEAR with the majority being exported. I believe that Art believes every word he says and that if he owned a million guns himself the country would be safer than Canada. Unfortunately, that is not the case and the lack of control - of the few people that need it, is overshadowing the freedoms of the many that don't. This is clearly a ""when in Rome"" scenario. If I lived in the US, in that culture...Art would be the first guy I'd call for a how to defend my family lesson. In reverse, if Art moved here, I could tell him to happily keep his collection of non prohibited firearms but the bedside home security stuff isn't necessary. Sleep easy. With so many guns freely distributed the conversations about US gun control are about 100 years too late. And with so many model countries that have low gun crime coupled with reasonable gun control, the choice to defend a wide open system that is clearly failing is a purposeful one. If the government tried any form of control now, they'd get their uprising sooner than later. God bless the innocent that die needlessly and those that live in fear...in any country. I actually do not want a million guns but I want the ability to own a million legally obtained guns through an avenue that attempts to keep them out of bad peoples hands. Some might be thinking that I am a person that spends lots of time with his gun. To put it in perspective I spend more time a year brushing my teeth than shooting my guns. If I were ever blessed to move to Canada I would leave all of my illegal arms in the USA  because your governments laws have assured you it will be done that way.  As I said and will say it is not my intent to change any ones mind on gun control it is a concept that is way to deep to debate on a forum when the people are looking at it from vastly different directions. Both from cultural and misinformation it would take a case of beer and 2 or 3 nights around a campfire to just get to neutral ground.  This is a deflection. Let's parse all the ""what ifs"" and make it simple.  Do you believe this individual should have been able to buy guns legally?  If yes, no change is required to maintain the status quo.  If no, then start supporting reasonable and effective background checks.  It's irksome that the pro gun lobby treats any suggestion of the smallest change as an automatic assault on the Constitution.

I'm thinking that at least half of you posting on this thread would have rushed the shooter during his first reload.  A lot of ground can be covered during the 2 or 3 or 4 seconds eaten up while reloading.    My time is slower that than, but I have very little experience with an AR 15.   Shooter could have and should have been taken down while doing his first reload.  FBI was aware the shooter was a potential threat, but the FBI is held back by rules set by congress."

973428,Old Ironmaker,2016-06-13 03:20:00,8243,"I just heard on CNN that the first person he met entering the club was the security guard, an off duty Orlando Police Officer. 100% he was armed though that wasn't reported, just my guess. He may be the first gunned down. I would think that the club may have had a zero gun policy for entrance, most clubs do. So so much for someone else stopping the gun man with their own weapon inside the club.  I would bet at least 70% of the folks I met in Fla that live there had handguns, some in Fanny Packs or in their vehicles, many in their tackle boxes, many told me they have a gun in the house, young and old. I was shocked to see 2 elderly gentlemen show each other their guns in a Walmart parking lot. My father said call the Police, you aren't home Dad, this is Florida. I have heard shots many times at night from HWY 41 from the condo, many times. A few times fishing when Bubba thought it was a good idea to pepper the street sign when we were putting out Rods in the car during the day.  It is a good idea to carry a Fanny Pack around your waist in Florida. I did and many people wanted to know what I was ""packing"". It is a popular method to carry and conceal. They make them specifically for certain hand guns. Then again some nut may think you are armed and you may be the first one shot. I don't buy the ""everyone should carry to protect the public"". Has it ever happened? Maybe but I never heard it happening down south where Joe Public takes down a crazed gun man. Off duty Cop, yes but never but a Law Enforcement guy."

Police and military style with 15 to 30 round magazines you can change out in a few seconds? and no limit on how many magazines you can buy or own? At close range, as in a nightclub or school, they are just as deadly as an assault rifle.

Not everyone is/can be responsible with owning a gun and that's probably the difficult part to please everyone.  But ya, AR15 rifle? Really? Any average Joe can buy that and we saw the end result from the incident. It's clear there's a flaw in the system, but it just gets politicized and it never gets fixed.

How on earth will you be able to fight your government, defend your rights, if the government has better guns then the public? I'm starting to feel like I should not be feeling bad for the victims of this horrific event, but for all Americans who are being forced to live in a place where there is no right to live, just the right to defend. HH"
973467,grimsbylander,2016-06-13 14:34:00,3016,"I'm weighing in on this now only because of HH's comment. As Canadians, we cannot truly comprehend the depth of the gun culture in the US. Just as they cannot understand our aversion to it. This is because as HH illustrated, we view it from opposite angles. They see gun ownership as a right, as a basic need for life; food, shelter, security. We see it as something that erodes our security. My work involves the small arms industry in Canada and the US. For perspective, I can confirm that one of the well known US firearms manufacturers produces 30,000 guns per MONTH. That's one manufacturer. In contrast, a top 3 Canadian manufacturer is about 6,000 per YEAR with the majority being exported. I believe that Art believes every word he says and that if he owned a million guns himself the country would be safer than Canada. Unfortunately, that is not the case and the lack of control - of the few people that need it, is overshadowing the freedoms of the many that don't. This is clearly a ""when in Rome"" scenario. If I lived in the US, in that culture...Art would be the first guy I'd call for a how to defend my family lesson. In reverse, if Art moved here, I could tell him to happily keep his collection of non prohibited firearms but the bedside home security stuff isn't necessary. Sleep easy. With so many guns freely distributed the conversations about US gun control are about 100 years too late. And with so many model countries that have low gun crime coupled with reasonable gun control, the choice to defend a wide open system that is clearly failing is a purposeful one. If the government tried any form of control now, they'd get their uprising sooner than later. God bless the innocent that die needlessly and those that live in fear...in any country."

Sure, you can say if there was a gun-reform in place, he could have made a bomb, but that's not the reality here.

I have 2 for protection they will be used for protection so why didn't I stop at owning 2?  I have a moderate collection of arms that will never be used for protection I look at guns as a collectable tool and works of art. I have been lucky enough to see a few amazing collections that go from a .22 silenced assassins weapon to a .50 Caliber sniper rifle. The collection of legally owned automatic weapons and other oddities to me look like a fine art collection. The aspect of military weapons in the civilian world is due to people using them in the war and bringing them back with them. It is a weapon that saved or keep them alive so a bond few would understand was formed. Some know I was part of the special forces and the training I received  was extensive with some amazing pieces of machinery that I was trained and allowed to use. I am most comfortable shooting military style weapons with their optics and recoil reduction designs. The military really knows how to design a weapon. I have both styles military and hunting weapons and the AR15 goes to the range and is just as entertaining as my finest fishing rod on the water.

They have not released any info on the suspect but lets see if he too is a radical Muslim. If it turns out he is you can bet your bottom dollar the two incidents are related.

The criminals have guns because guns are easy to access.  I think that some better form of education and regulation is required. More than what is required in the US, less than what is required in Canada. Shooting enthusiasts should be able to enjoy their sport responsibly, they are not the ones running around killing peoples. Responsible gun owners who wish to keep and store a weapon properly at home should be able to. Gun owners who don't respect their weapons or know how to store them properly need to be educated, otherwise we end up with situations such as toddlers finding and playing with guns.

973316,misfish,2016-06-12 18:10:00,29133,The tragedy is not that a gun was used in a killing it is that a person has the mindset to do such a horrific thing.  Why O why do you not see it is the people who are acting rather than the gun? Pandoras box is open banning all guns will not correct this. Guns are just the weapon of choice would it be better if it was a pipe bomb? I am sure that this will get lots of how too comments most will be just wishful thinking none will be the answer that will solve the issue.   Art  People kill. NOT GUNS.

973318,Terry,2016-06-12 18:14:00,14456,"clearly it was not a fight the point was the lesser the weapon the lest damage will be done  we get the same type of terrorism here just not as much  but for the most part they use hunting rifles not automatic rifles, why you  ask  no you would not ask..but I will tell because they are hard to get here"
973319,JoePa,2016-06-12 18:19:00,179,The number of people that got killed could have been averted if some of the people there had guns to defend themselves - considering all solutions the only one that will work is for good people to have guns - time and time again some nuts comes into a place and starts shooting and there is no one  to stop him - you can pass all the laws you want but it is impossible to keep guns out of the hands of some nut -

The majority of firearms enthusiasts in Canada are not even hunters, that statement makes about as much sense as you don't need a power boat to go fishing."

973325,Terry,2016-06-12 18:41:00,14456,"sure I know it well, but it does not change my opinion nor does it  change this conversation its like saying do you know why isis is attacking... 50 people are dead the rest of it is politics"

Where ever you have gun free zones in the US the criminals are the only ones with the guns.  You look at the shooter on Capitol Hill. He was taken out by a person who had a gun. He had to go to his office and get it but without it there would have been many more injuries and deaths.  Firearms are tools, no different than a hammer or a screwdriver in the hands of a competent, qualified individual. FYI, there have been plenty of murders using a screw driver or hammer. Better ban those too.  This also wasn't a mass shooting, it was a terror attack by a radical Islamic terrorist. Just like the attack in California late last year or the attacks in France."

Give it a friggin' rest!! We really don't need to hear that same old tiresome old argument/rationalization/justification at this time."

We really don't need to hear that same old tiresome old argument/rationalization/justification at this time.  2 days earlier, a hero took action,  even without a gun, while his sister lay dying, only 2 miles from this massacre, that situation could have turned equally as deadly by the weaponry the shooter had with him. Make your choice, victim or fight back ."
