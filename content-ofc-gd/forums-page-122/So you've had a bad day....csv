974692,Big Cliff,2016-06-24 12:14:00,6899,"How long did it take this guy to return??????? You don't just drive up the highway, see a boat and motors laying on the road/side of the road and pop it on an empty trailer you just happened to be towing all within a couple of minutes. Something strange about this one!"
974694,woodenboater,2016-06-24 12:29:00,2277,how do you NOT realise your boat has come off the trailer ??
974704,Sinker,2016-06-24 13:04:00,8692,"Yeah, saw this last night as well. He thinks his strap was cut off, and the people who cut it followed until the boat came off. Pretty crazy! I don't know how he didn't notice it gone though.....small boat behind a big truck maybe? WEird for sure.   S."
974709,AKRISONER,2016-06-24 13:47:00,5558,seems like a bit of an extreme heist for such an old boat...something is off about this.
974710,Fisherman,2016-06-24 14:13:00,7201,"Ya, if it came off the trailer while rolling, the motors probably got trashed and not really worth the effort to take it."
974716,DanD,2016-06-24 15:35:00,2223,"Ya, if it came off the trailer while rolling, the motors probably got trashed and not really worth the effort to take it.  That's what I was thinking; it be one beat up, road-rash pile of aluminum.  Dan."
974717,Freshtrax,2016-06-24 15:40:00,2215,2 motors on a boat that size?   Strange.
974719,Dutch01,2016-06-24 16:03:00,1431,"Could be an insurance scam. I don't know the guy from Adam, so I'm not saying it is. But something definitely seems off here and stranger things have happened."
974730,John Bacon,2016-06-24 18:11:00,3277,"Yeah, saw this last night as well. He thinks his strap was cut off, and the people who cut it followed until the boat came off. Pretty crazy! I don't know how he didn't notice it gone though.....small boat behind a big truck maybe? WEird for sure.   S.  That doesn't make much sense.  They would be counting on:   2 motors on a boat that size? Strange.  It's not uncommon for people add a kicker when they have a six as their main motor... more common for six cylinder motors than six horse power motors though"
