Every year, thousands of the winged aquatic insects emerge from local bodies of water, only to hover around lights, cling to windows and walls, mate and then die â€” all within about 48 hours. This year, the hatch is so abundant, it's being captured every evening on radar in Detroit. The National Weather Service tweeted a picture of the hatch June 18. The image shows dark blue patches, representing thousands of fish flies, over Lake St. Clair and the western edge of Lake Erie."

I remember that; it was crazy thick with them. My dad was a good friend of Bob Stonewall, the original owner of Stony's Hardware in Dover. I can remember standing in his store, looking out one of the big display windows, being terrified of them; thinking they were huge mosquitoes. LOL I was only 5 or 6 at the time. LOL  Dan."
974690,Sterling,2016-06-24 11:58:00,477,Are we to expect a large number of them in North Bay as well then?  They haven't been bad since ~2004 or so. Back then it was dangerous to drive because roads were slick with mayfly guts (shad flies we call them here).
