974917,spincast,2016-06-26 23:23:00,3279,"They're definitely North shore bound. A certain charter captain tagged a 31 lber this week, and went 33 for 38 not too long ago, Derby on this weekend so Spoonpullers would be less useful than usual... not that it is what is used to be in the days of black and yellow."
974919,Pikeslayer,2016-06-26 23:53:00,1443,Port Credi is the hot spot so far.
974930,Freshtrax,2016-06-27 00:50:00,2215,im out of fishermans stuck in the west end. We're picking up some decent fish but no crazy numbers days yet.   East end should heat up in the next few weeks Whitby ect.
