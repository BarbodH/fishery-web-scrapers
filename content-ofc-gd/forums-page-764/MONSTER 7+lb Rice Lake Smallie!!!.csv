401772,ch312,2009-11-12 21:49:00,1590, ill never understand why people feel the need to hold their fish as far away from their bodies as possible. it makes pics look quite foolish and you can never tell how big the fish actually is...
401821,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-13 00:15:00,2038,  All the Pro's do it...
401825,misfish,2009-11-13 00:23:00,29133,Cant believe this.   How much longer mods???????
401839,Roy,2009-11-13 01:06:00,13728,"I understand Brian but I didn't want to cut out Greg's thread nor did I want to rain on Dave's parade. Remember that this is what a few folks like to do. I really don't want to give them the satisfaction. I'm sure that Greg, as a professional and Dave with a bigger fish than most people will ever see aren't worrying about it too much. Let's just back off on it."
402081,Cookslav,2009-11-14 01:39:00,1457,"Thats a beauty alright,  To the angler...Congrats on one heck of a catch, I'm jealous. And to Greg....Thanks for sharing. The only thing better then a 2nd hand account is catching it your self, and a brute like that hasn't graced my line yet so I appreciate the post. Cheers,"
402165,fish_fishburn,2009-11-14 15:39:00,1311,Awesome hawg. I have been fishing bass religiously for 35 yrs and am still looking for a 7 pound smallie. It may never happen but its nice to see someone catch one for sure. They are few and far between. Tight lines.
402247,jaydub,2009-11-15 00:59:00,145,Congrates to your buddy!!      That's gonna be a tough one to beat.
402263,Daplumma,2009-11-15 02:04:00,1961,Roy...King of the Zingers..Love ya bud. Joe
402370,lunkerbasshunter,2009-11-15 14:31:00,2585,"wow 24"" is one long smallie!  Got to love november fishing!!!!  Cheers!"
402645,NTBugtraq,2009-11-16 13:33:00,3,"A little light humour...  It was very early one morning while I was on my way from the house to the boat (at my shore) when I noticed a fish on the lawn! Some 50' from shore, in the middle of the grass, was a Muskie! 20"" long, probably 5lbs-ish, laying dead on the grass. The dogs all sniffed around it, and at first I gave them each a stern glare...somehow my dogs had caught a fish??  Closer inspection revealed deep gashes on either side of the mid-back...ah ha, talons! Those dang Osprey had been at work again. No doubt an enterprising Osprey had managed to catch the thing, but then must have realized it was under the legal limit and released it. I just wish they'd use a different rig for catching, and find better spots for their release!  Never leave for an Osprey something you could mount...;-]  Cheers, Russ"
400714,mbosh1980,2009-11-09 19:43:00,349,that's a great catch
400721,Mike Pike,2009-11-09 20:14:00,1332,"Wow, a great great catch!  At first I thought you were the one to get 'er Jim, but it was one of your guests.  Boy, he'll never forget that trip and has himself a trophy remember it by.  Probably will never get tired of telling the story 'bout catching it.  Cheers!"
400768,ecmilley,2009-11-09 23:13:00,2163,"Awesome fish, it is a trophy of a lifetime and will look great on the wall. As usual Greg a informative and excellant post enjoy the hunt"
400777,hendrix,2009-11-09 23:40:00,61,that fish looks delicious
400778,Roy,2009-11-09 23:45:00,13728," Wait, I'll put on my glasses...I'm still trying to figure out who Jim is.  Sorry folks, as they say, I get paid by the hour and older by the minute."
400935,singingdog,2009-11-10 11:33:00,1047,"Maybe I should qualify my comment. I don't argue that he has a legal right to keep the fish. I also wouldn't expect slayingm to usurp that right and make the guy put it back. Jealous? You bet. Any smallie fisherman worth his dropshot rig would be jealous of someone landing a fish like that.  The only reason that I think it's a shame, is that the possibilty of ever re-catching that fish is gone now. For me, knowing that a monster is down there waiting for me to do all the right things, far outweighs the benefit of having it mounted on the wall never to be caught again."
400984,Mike Pike,2009-11-10 14:32:00,1332," Clearly, I'm the one who needs glasses, not you Roy.  Sorry GREG, my bad!  lol"
400989,johnnyb,2009-11-10 14:45:00,3413,"Totally amazing fish!! What a way to end the season, Greg...thanks for sharing!!"
401012,Toronto_Angler,2009-11-10 15:57:00,698,  I'm guessing you're not a hunter lol
401109,corvette1,2009-11-10 21:14:00,1765,awesome
401111,ciceri,2009-11-10 21:16:00,535,That'd make some miraculous jerky.
401113,Uncle Buck,2009-11-10 21:33:00,1000,Awesome fish!!
401125,Slayingm,2009-11-10 22:33:00,204,"  Hey Fish3Eyes,  You are exactly right!!....personlly I would never of kept the fish myself but rather opt for a replica.... although I encouraged David to do the same he really wanted to get a original skin mount and had to respect that as he was licenced and had every right todo so..... Greg."
401233,T Fisher,2009-11-11 03:01:00,139,Gongrat's to a beauty of a fish but a replaca would have sufficed and always looks better IMO.
401239,rickster,2009-11-11 03:24:00,495,"The negative comments by some are really starting to piss me off. The guy caught a great fish and he decided to keep it. BIG DEAL! I wonder how many of you negative people have ever kept a walleye or pike or something else for a meal? How do you know that 16"" walleye you kept for a meal wouldn't have been a 29 or 30"" fish in a few  (or many) years Maybe you ate an eventual trophy fish  The guy caught a fish of a lifetime He kept it. Get over  it Sorry for the rant but I am getting tired of some people jumping all over a guy for keeping a fish, or holding it wrong, or whatever else someone thinks is so bad that they feel the need to bash a guy when all he is doing is trying to share a great fishing experience"
401396,Weeds,2009-11-11 19:15:00,782,"I think people can disagree with a guys choice to keep a fish without it being seen as bashing him. Some folks are passionate about catch and release; they are just as entitled to speak their opinion as anyone else. When you decide to excercise your right to keep a trophy fish you are inviting others to excercise their right to disagree with you. That's how it works. And that once in a lifetime fish thing becomes especially true if you decide to keep it, once in the anglers life who keeps and it and denies anyone else a future shot at that fish getting any bigger. But, sure, it's within his rights to do so. It's within my rights to fart in a crowded elevator too but...well...I've probably already said too much."
401399,Roy,2009-11-11 19:24:00,13728, I really wish you'd keep and not release those though.
401417,Fishing 24/7,2009-11-11 20:27:00,709, agree 100%  anyways a fish that size  wouldnt of survived the hard winter  its an old fish and they DO die of old age.  that fish was a gonner anyways.  im thinking that this fish was going out for ONE LAST MEAL.  and got SCORED by an angler. CONGRATS!
401430,Weeds,2009-11-11 21:02:00,782,A quick google search shows the Ontario record Smallmouth to be 9 plus pounds. Presumably it took it a few years to go from 7 plus to 9 plus. What makes you certain this fish would not make it through the winter?
401431,Roy,2009-11-11 21:09:00,13728, Cause he didn't make it through the fall! Sorry....it just jumped out. Can we please let this one go?
401432,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-11 21:09:00,2038,  So what !!
401433,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-11 21:11:00,2038,  
401611,lew,2009-11-12 10:03:00,12766, The exact reason so many folks no longer post fishing reports anymore.
401739,Harrison,2009-11-12 19:44:00,2202,Awesome brown fish from RICE!!!  What the...  are you sure you just didn't forget to take it out of the livewell from simcoe?  Beauty Greg   Keyboard please..
401741,bicephalic,2009-11-12 19:59:00,112, x 2...really takes the fun out of sharing in the community here sometimes..
400474,Slayingm,2009-11-09 00:31:00,204,"Well,  This is truly incredible.  I have fished Rice for over 25yrs including 20yrs of Professional Bass tournaments on that lake and the very best I have every done was a 6.03lb smallie that won me Big Fish award in a tournament one year.  I just had one of my last guide trips of the year on Rice and one of my clients nailed a 7.05lb Smallmouth on a black bucktail jig while fishing for walleye along a deep weedline adjacent to a hard botton in approx. 10' of water.  We had already taken a nice walleye along this break when David yelped out 'Fishon'!.  When I 1st saw the fish clear the water my jaw must have nearly dropped to the bottom of the boat as I new this fish was incredibly huge.  After a long fight in the wind I finally slid the net upder the fish and into the boat... the 4 of us could not believe what we were looking at!  On the scale the fished weighted 7.05lbs (and usually weights a little light) and was over 24"" long and had a 16.5"" girth.  What a spectacular fish for a Kawartha lake.  David new he had a trophy of a live time and after quick deliberation decided to keep the fish as he wanted a actual skin mount vs a replica.  David is a big guy at 6' 2"" and here is a pic of his monster smallie:      Also, here is a pic of one of the nice Walleye taken....    Great way to end the soft water season for another year.  Looking foward to a little break now todo some bow hunting with my son before the hardwater ice fishing season starts.  Take care and good fish'n.... Greg."
400477,dada2727,2009-11-09 00:33:00,108,What a monsta!
400482,darsky,2009-11-09 00:41:00,586,what a great fish and huge congrats.........BUT you should have a catch & release policy on examples like this IMO
400483,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-09 00:45:00,2038,Nice Trophy right there...
400484,uglyfish,2009-11-09 00:45:00,981,"awesome smallie! true giant. little sad he kept it, but its his choice and i cant really say i blame him for wanting to remember that fish forever!"
400485,Leecher,2009-11-09 00:46:00,7832,Absolutely Astonishing Congrats to David on this freak of nature Thanks for sharing Greg!!! Leechman
400488,mojobass,2009-11-09 00:49:00,34,That is a pretty sweet smallie. Amazing! Thanks for sharing.
400502,MCTFisher9120,2009-11-09 01:41:00,3761,"Hard to tell it's big...that reach makes it looks the fish is sitting on it's fin on his knee lol.  I'm sure it's big but hard to tell, great catch!  MTBF"
400514,Rizzo,2009-11-09 02:08:00,4754,"what a giant, fantastic catch"
400524,Sandbag,2009-11-09 02:23:00,533,Awesome fish...congrats to all involved..  A once in a lifetime smally for sure...especially out of that body of water...  Cheers  Craig
400528,Cudz,2009-11-09 02:27:00,2652,"nice.  24""!!! wow"
400536,fishhunter,2009-11-09 03:00:00,604,WELL DONE!!!
400592,singingdog,2009-11-09 11:26:00,1047,Beautiful fish. It's a shame he kept it.
400601,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-09 12:27:00,2038,  It was going to die soon anyways....
400649,Fishnwire,2009-11-09 15:48:00,983,"I explain to people who are about to get into my boat what the catch and release policy is.  If they don't like it, they can stay on the dock...and they're not allowed to fish off of that either.  There is at least one guy who thought I wasn't serious about enforcement and he hasn't been invited back since.  I guess if a professional guide did that it wouldn't be very good for business."
400651,Hellfish,2009-11-09 15:56:00,308,"thats one heck of a bronzeback, congrats to your client.. And why did yall have to go and ruin a perfectly good post. Starting to sound like a P3TA post."
400652,Fishnwire,2009-11-09 15:57:00,983,"  You don't know that...it looked pretty healthy to me.  That fish might have easily had a spawn or two left in it.  Besides, even if it was about to die, it would probably have prefered old age to being air drowned.  Since I didn't catch the fish, I have no say in what the person who did catch it does with it, but I know what I would have done.  The guy didn't break the law and is entitled to keep the fish if he wants.  That's fine, but don't make excuses or act like he did anyone any favours by doing so."
400658,Toronto_Angler,2009-11-09 16:23:00,698,It's fishing. As long as he is within the law you have no right to criticize the guy for keeping his fish. It's his choice.
400670,Roy,2009-11-09 17:08:00,13728,Congrats David on a catch that's got some folks green with envy apparently. Props to you Greg for consistently putting your guests on quality fish.
400673,FLEX ROD,2009-11-09 17:21:00,394,"Folks,  Last time I checked MNR has got rules and regulations as to what we can and can not keep and also limits and size restrictions on some species, and by the person purchasing the proper license, he or she has the sole right to judge as to what they do with the fish. Yes, MNR even has rules as how should handle the fish.  We all have different thoughts on this matter but the decision of keeping a fish is solely the fisherman's who caught the fish and no ones else so why chastise the fisherman instead just saying wow nice fish.  Oh, by the way I practice catch and release about 95% of the time.  FLEX"
400677,Fish4Eyes,2009-11-09 17:34:00,1022,"Like someone mentioned earlier, he does this for a living and if he refused that the guest keep the fish, that guest would more than likely not come back for his services. Im sure slayingm would not of kept it if he caught it. Get off the guys back!"
400678,always_release,2009-11-09 17:47:00,5,"Well, let's look at this way, at least next time he catches a 6-1/2 pounder he probably would not keep it..."
400683,anders,2009-11-09 18:04:00,1168,nice fish!  A mount that he will always look at and remember.  Why do we feel the need to bash people's right to keep a fish?  He didnt keep his limit of them that size...  Some people might need to have a glass of warm milk and take a nap!
400699,Whitespinnerbait,2009-11-09 19:07:00,2038,  100% jealousy.......
400712,Fishing 24/7,2009-11-09 19:38:00,709,awesome PALLETTE!
