402069,Leecher,2009-11-14 01:06:00,7832,Right on rickster Nice chocolate rack on that buck Hope he shows up for you tomorrow Break a leg!!! Jacques
402085,Skud,2009-11-14 01:50:00,739,What neck? He just has shoulders and a head. That's unreal. Great looking Buck!
402102,misfish,2009-11-14 03:02:00,29133,"Told ya see,I told ya. Massive bucks there Rick. Thanks for the pics. I would say a battle scar for sure.Man you got some big brusiers there.  Dont ask about the doe tonight ok.She just appeared when I wasnt looking.  One minute nothing,the next,there she was.  I was in the field tonight."
402136,Cudz,2009-11-14 05:40:00,2652,"Those are nice looking boys there. Not to hyjack this thread but seeing as 2 Barrie boys responded, I thought I would share this.  I saw a doe get hit today by a car.  On Ferndale between Tiffen and Dunlop. She didn't get hit hard but was half on the road and half on the shoulder.  She was stunned.  When a guy walked toward her she got up and stumbled into the forest with what appeared to be at least one broken front leg.  Sad to see. Not sure what will come of it.  I doubt she made it far."
402148,Fisherman,2009-11-14 12:36:00,7201,"She may last a few days or more, if any longer then winter will undoubtedly deal her the blow and she will become crow and coyote food. Where I work out in the Borden Ranges I would sure like to know deer reasoning for crossing the road when they are perfectly safe where they are in the first place, but NOoooo, they just have to run across the road every time they see ya  coming.  Stop 3 feet off the road, look over their shoulder and don't move again."
402160,richyb,2009-11-14 15:03:00,774,WOW those are some big necks for sure ! COME TO POPPA
402244,misfish,2009-11-15 00:53:00,29133,Well did you see him Rick? I just had to look again and bump this.Massive buck.
402479,brkygetr,2009-11-15 23:28:00,425,Nice Rick...gotta love the country eh? Was out for a ride with my buddy today out your way and seen 2 nice ones between 2 and 3 in the afternoon. The boys are movin' no doubt about it.

Sat saw a doe and two fawns right of the bat and then rattled  in a small 8 point the rain started after that so i called it quits   Went out again this morning and didn't see a darn animal Looks like the deer won this round
