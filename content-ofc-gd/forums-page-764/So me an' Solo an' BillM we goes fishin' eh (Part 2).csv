401897,Paulus,2009-11-13 04:01:00,522,"  So, as I mentioned in my previous topic/post, I was going over to Solo's to try and rescue his Hard Drive and his My Pictures file. The bad news is that I didn't have an enclosure for a SATA drive, so I couldn't scan it for lost files - i.e. the My Pictures folder couldn't be recovered (by me) . The good news is that I managed to clean it of ad-ware with Spybot. So the machine should run better now, and I think that it may have been one of the nastier bugs he had which could have caused him to lose the My Pictures folder. My recommendation: take it to the shop & have a professional scan it for lost data & possibly recover all or most of the lost pics.  More good news is that I was able to scan the Solo man's camera's memory card and I managed to extract a little more than half the pictures he took last week. As he's still out and about enjoying himself, I thought I'd share a few of them with you on his behalf.  He's going to have some wicked pics for you when gets back  !     Here's that double header I was telling you about... (looks like Mike caught them both).            Hope you enjoyed them!  p.-"

401907,Paulus,2009-11-13 04:21:00,522," didn't get many good ones that trip, but I have some on tap for today's trip. I'm waiting for Solo to get back before I post them. He has good ones, too  p.-"

401933,MJL,2009-11-13 13:53:00,2427,Great pics from both parts.  Nicely done guys.  Stunning fish all around
401936,msp,2009-11-13 14:12:00,1336,"Nice fish there guys. They look like fesh chromers to me. Thanks.  P.S. you can download a great program called ""recuva"" for finding lost or deleted files"
401947,Paulus,2009-11-13 14:39:00,522," Thanks for the compliments  I did try recuva, but it wasn't able to find the missing My Pictures folder. It is a cool program though, because it's made by Piriform. All their software is good!  p.-"
402328,solopaddler,2009-11-15 12:22:00,8605,Sweet. It's been a crazy 3 day chrome-a-thon. I think this time I'll let Moosebunk share our adventure with everyone. For someone who's never caught a steelhead before he sure caught on fast.
