Would you use this to occasionally treat the leather of the boot or will this prevent the breathability of the product?  What else would you use on your boot? What about sprays? I have a non-silicone spray from BPS.  I think the oil is effective if the boot has been through a lot and they begin to dry out a bit...\  the website doesn't really say much..  thanks!"
