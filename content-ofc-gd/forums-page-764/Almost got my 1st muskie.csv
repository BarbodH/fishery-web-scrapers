It was a beautiful day , hardly a cloud in the sky, just a gentle breeze.   Within 15 minutes Lew had a nice fish hooked, he got it half way to the boat....it got off....DOH!   About half an hour later he got one in the boat....a nice 35"" fish.  It went quiet for the next couple hours until i hooked into my 1st ever Muskie.....i got it half way to the boat....it got off....DOH again   Lew was trolling an 16"" firetiger crankbait, i was trolling a 16"" beleiver.....its meant tolook like a whitefish but i think it looks like a maniti....lol   We ended the day by stopping at a point dropping of nto deeper water facing the main basin of the lake and got a few walleye for the table.   There was ice at the landing, and lots of ice starting in the sheltered bays, so not long before we're out there icefishing......anyway...here's the pics from yesterday.   ICE AT THE BOAT LAUNCH      IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY          LEW GOT ONE IN AND OUT OF THE BOAT        AND WE FINISHED THE DAY WITH A FEW OF THESE     I WILL GET MY FIRST MUSKIE SOON.....LOL  very cool for me to actually get one on the end of my line, and not bad considering thats only my second time out trying for them."

402931,Rizzo,2009-11-17 01:13:00,4754," for real? They make a 16 inch believer? I think the ""common"" size is around 9 inches. Pretty sure I've seen some around a foot (13 inches?), but 16 is news to me...or perhaps you have a ""man's perception"" of inches   Whatever it is you're trolling around, keep at it and you will be rewarded."
