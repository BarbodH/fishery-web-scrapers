402854,StoneFly,2009-11-16 23:03:00,574,"  Thats Good Advice for sure.  As for the all the costs, I have an islander and I think my collection of leader material and floats adds up to more than the reel, lol."
402888,MJL,2009-11-16 23:48:00,2427," Ya gotta start picking floats off trees at the end of the season   .  I normally go for the Riverwoods and customs and leave the Drennans behind for the others (can’t see them anyway)    Got 5 boxes worth of floats in total…1 box of floats just from this spring and early fall   …If in the middle of the night you see a strange figure climbing up a tree on the far bank, please don’t try to shoot it"
402896,StoneFly,2009-11-16 23:57:00,574," I think a couple of those are mine, lol.  but seriously thats ALOT of floats from the tree's.  Most of the ones i see are suspended above an area I want to fish,....so I kinda dont bother ruining the hole for a $2 float     Good on ya for cleaning up the scenery though,..I hope you pick up all the line and other garbage that people leave as well"
401324,[email protected],2009-11-11 14:59:00,290,"Hey Guys.  I'm really starting to get into the steelheading and I think I want to pick up a starter centerpin (nothing extravagant) so that I can start to get a hang of it in time for the spring (and of course catch some fish along the way).  I know its all trial and error while learning how to cast and drift, but I was just wondering what the standard setup is for spooling line.  For example when using braid on a spinning/baitcaster its good practice to cover the spool with mono first before putting the braid on.  Is there a similar technique when spooling a centerpin?  I appreciate the help as always guys... I'll be heading to my favorite steel place tonight, if you want to join me send me a message!"
401328,kemper,2009-11-11 15:18:00,2232,Grab a spool of fly line backing and spin a bunch of it on first. Float reels hold stupid huge amounts of line
401559,MJL,2009-11-12 01:44:00,2427,"As Kemper mentioned, spool some fly line backing onto the spool and then spool mono over top of it.  Dacron lines also work well as a backing - I've got 30lb Cortland Musky Master filled up on my Islander.  Some reels have shallower spools (eg. Angspec, JW youngs') and backing isn't entirely necessary for those reels (if you plan on wallis casting most of the time you don't need much line on the spool anyway).  I think I only ran about 50-60 yards of mono on a JW.Young (Bob James) when I owned one briefly."
401887,rbaquial,2009-11-13 02:53:00,968," I can tell you my 1st setup... this will be my 1st full year steelheadin'. Here's my setup:  Floatreel: MATRIX (By: Raven)   Floatrod: 12'6"" 2-PC Shimano ""Convergence""   Line: Unsure at this point (The store I bought it from spooled it up for free; Plus, I got the rod & terminal tackle the same day too.)  I've been thinking of upgrading my toys... but I haven't used it nearly long enough. So, I'm not going to. Plus, bearings are the best/cheapest way to upgrade."
402654,[email protected],2009-11-16 14:20:00,290,"lol I spooled the whole pack of mono on the reel and had issues (obviously).  I think I'll grab some fly line to put the backing on,.  lol.  I ended up just switching back to my spinning reel for floating."
402668,frozen-fire,2009-11-16 15:11:00,542,"wait, so you got a float reel and stopped using it?  stick with it man  I just picked mine up not that long ago. I have been skunked every time using it though...but still learning. Even just after the first outing, I could see how much easier and more effective it is compared to a spinning outfit on the river."
402676,[email protected],2009-11-16 15:27:00,290,I Just bought a cheap one from CT.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/Sp...BFly%2BReel.jsp  It's probably not even the right type lol. (told you I was a noob)
402680,MJL,2009-11-16 15:33:00,2427," Is that link of the reel you bought? Or perhaps the wrong link?  You may want to reconsider that purchase if you're looking for a float reel...If you bought it, you purchased a fly reel...Fly reels are totally different from centrepin float reels.  With that said, a lot of guys up fishing Lake Superior tribs spool mono onto their fly reels and use them for bottom bouncing."
402682,BillM,2009-11-16 15:34:00,17367,  You are going to have a hard time float fishing with a flyfishing reel...
402683,[email protected],2009-11-16 15:35:00,290, See? lol..  Thats why I asked for help lol..  Where can I get a decently priced float reel then lol  I thought they were all the same.
402687,MJL,2009-11-16 15:42:00,2427,Not overly familiar with the Brantford area but 2 shops which sell them not too far include: - Natural Sports in Kitchener http://www.naturalsports.ca/listings.php?category_id=7  and  Angler's Outfitters in Woodstock
402688,[email protected],2009-11-16 15:44:00,290," Wow,..  Those are expensive lol...  Are there any under $100 for a starter? lol"
402692,frozen-fire,2009-11-16 15:50:00,542,probably better to just get a decent one and not want to upgrade after you get the hang of it.  look in classifieds for used ones.
402711,kemper,2009-11-16 16:23:00,2232,"  no  look for a used one, if your looking for something around a hundred keep your eyes out for someone selling a raven matrix. Its not the best pin out there and certainly not the prettiest but it is bulletproof and will do the job until you decide if you want to upgrade or not"
402715,steelie hunter,2009-11-16 16:29:00,55,"if you want something under $100, it will have to be used. If you are willing to spend a little more, head to Angling Outfitters and see Joc. You wont find a better deal for a beginner float reel. Okuma Aventas with the upgraded bearings go for around $169 new. Thats what I bought in the Spring and I like.  No, its not a kingpin or anything, but its caught its fair share of big fish in my first year, and it spins nicely with the upgraded bearings. Give him a call at the very least.  519-539-5494"
402716,steelie hunter,2009-11-16 16:31:00,55,"On another note, to the original poster, yes it might seem like a lot of money for a centerpin, but it will last you as long as you want it to. Not like spinning reels, that you have to replace every other year"
402721,[email protected],2009-11-16 16:50:00,290,Last time I went to AO Joc wasn't there.. lol.. I was disappointed
402724,steelhead197,2009-11-16 17:08:00,38,Watch classifieds!!
402735,MJL,2009-11-16 17:47:00,2427," If you can find one, the ugly black LEEDS reels used to sell in the neighbourhood of $100.  The tolerances were pretty poor and it wobbled when you spun it but those reels started many anglers onto using the centrepin.  They also mashed up your hand pretty bad when a fish took you for a run cause the machining was pretty poor    You could probably pick one up for $50 now.  I’d recommend saving up and getting something like a Raven or an Islander – You could probably get either used for $200-$250.  Buy once and there’s no ‘need’ to upgrade to something better later on.  I put ‘need’ in quotations because there will always be a ‘want’ for another reel"
402747,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-16 18:28:00,0,"equipping yourself with the float gear needed to consistently catch fish IS expensive. even once you have the rod and reel taken care of you should have quality floats, proper steelhead shot, quality hooks and it all REALLY starts to add up.  i bought an okuma aventa reel to start on and there's nothing wrong with it.  the okuma rods however are total crap.  invest in a quality rod."
402753,cuzza,2009-11-16 18:50:00,467, What's the difference between these and normal cheapo shot?
402760,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-16 19:09:00,0,"cheap shot usually comes in much larger sizes and has that stupid pinchy thing on the back to reopen the sinker once you've pinched it down on your line.  ""steelie"" shot has no pinchy thing on the back (less drag) and comes in sizes that get real small for slow flow/clear water applications.    VS  "
402765,[email protected],2009-11-16 19:24:00,290,Another question.. (Yes I have lots lol)  I recently bought a 10'6 Quantum rod. The action is noodle.  Would this suffice for a float reel like a Streamside FL425?
402784,msp,2009-11-16 20:13:00,1336,"If I were you......... I wouldnt even bother buying a float reel just yet. There is a lot to learn about steelheadig first. Learn how to consistantly catch them first on spinning gear for a year or two and then decide weather or not you want a float reel. You dont need the added aggrevation of learning how to use a float reel. It wont help you catch more fish. Its just a funner way of doing it. Some of the best steelheaders that I know use spinning gear. When you do finnaly decide on buying one, dont waste your $ on fly line backing. $2 redwolf mono from Crappy tire will fill the reel with your choice of 10# mono over top of it. Good luck."
402843,bare foot wader,2009-11-16 22:30:00,1354,"my understanding of running dacron backing is because it's lighter which makes for easier spool startup.......and provides some cushion which prevents the spool from warping....not sure how you would warp a centrepin spool, snag maybe? but that was what I was told years back....  a few things I'd suggest:  -agreed on keeping it simple...are you new to centre pinning or new to steelheading entirely? if you're complete noob I'd recommend just running your spinning reel and learning more important factors: ie how to tie your own egg sacs, reading the water, learning how to identify steelie water and dead water, how rainfall affects the rivers you fish, water temps, shot patterns, various knots, etc, etc....mastering these basic skills will improve your success far more than a centrepin  - find somebody who knows what they're doing and get out as much as possible....if you don't kjnow anybody then actually start watching guys on the river and what they are doing before you get out in the river  - raven makes a pretty informative little booklet, great for starters"
