Caught 7 bows between us and splashhopper even got a nice wee rock bass.  Most of the bows were shakers like this one   And then I hit into this nice 4lb male:   Sorry for the crappy images, but I dropped my camera and we used Splashhoppers blackberry camera.  Twas a good outing and probably the last warm weather we are going to get."

402798,Dutchy,2009-11-16 20:59:00,416," We only kept the 4lb one, all the others went back in. I'll see the shakers when they are a bit bigger hopefully. Splashhopper actually caught a very nice 2lb bow that he put back. I would have kept it, perfect eating size."
