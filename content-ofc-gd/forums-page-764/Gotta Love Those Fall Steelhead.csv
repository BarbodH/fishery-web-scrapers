The past week has been tough with the lack of rain, but I found switching up baits, even changing between different cures of Salmon roe, helped to trigger some much anticipated hits.   A colourful fall Buck.   Here's another angle.    Yet another male. Been catching a lot of them lately.    This was one of my larger catches.    This one put up a great fight. He went for the sticks, but my leader held. "

402673,Jet,2009-11-16 15:20:00,364,"Thanks Bill! Pictures don't even do that one justice, but I still got a long way to go before I start dropping the beauties you do.   Don't remind me F1 is over, it's the longest off-season for any sport. I guess I'll just have to go fishing in the meantime  Let's get out there soon.  Singles eh? I'll try that next time out!"
