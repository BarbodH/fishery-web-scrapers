I used them a lot this summer and I really like them.  Your bait hangs and falls just perfectly if rigged right (which is easy) and you can achieve different rates of fall and running depths because they come in various weights.  Here's what I'm talking about if you're not sure.     All the ones I've seen for sale have the natural colour lead.  I decided I'd paint a few and see if it makes any difference one way or another.  I thought black or brown would be a good choice because I tend to use dark and crawfish coloured plastics.  The addition of the paint may make the lead stand out a little less.  I'm going to do some in red too, because I have lots of red paint.  What do you guys think?  Should I bother? (I'm going to anyway...I'm bored) and what strategy would be better...attempting to camouflage the lead so it doesn't stand out or adding colour to act as an attractant?"

402321,mbac31,2009-11-15 11:54:00,904,I have been painting my hooks and weights for years. I have 3 cases of colors. I buy that Vinyl JIg paint to use on them. Make sure to put a toothpick in the eye while painting and a small peice of cork or sponge on the hook point as well
