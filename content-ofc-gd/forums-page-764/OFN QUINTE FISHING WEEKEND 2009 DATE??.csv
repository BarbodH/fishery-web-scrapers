It's tempting to drop a line down to that 100-120 foot mark out in the reach, but I'm guessing most of those numerous hooks are Lakers anyway...we actually caught a laker on a spoon at 35 feet...3 TIMES this weekend....ugh.

Bitsmith and I are now looking for one person for our cottage. Unfortunately, we will not have room in the boat for this person, but we are in a position to offer a place to crash, at Perfect Vue. (Should you have a boat and are looking for two to join you, that could work as we are now going to be using Bitsmiths boat, which will only accomodate 2 people.) We expect to be arriving on Friday, still working out details as to our arrival time. We have the cottage until Sunday. We are looking for someone to share expenses and of course, the odd beverage.

401589,lovetofish,2009-11-12 03:44:00,500,Myself and two buddies will be heading up on sunday and have never fished on BOQ before.  Not really sure where the boat launch is or where dock B is?   lovetofish
401678,Terry,2009-11-12 16:12:00,14456,well you can launch at Picton harbor that's where the docks are there is a ramp at the ferry too as well as many more places depending on the size of your boat and where you want to fish might determine   where to put your boat in they are calling for lots of wind the it does get big waves but there is always places to fish and the ramp near where you wan to fish may be your best bet
401680,irishfield,2009-11-12 16:15:00,26272,Packed yet Terry...

401705,lovetofish,2009-11-12 18:11:00,500,"the wind is suppose to be going to the north, so picton shouldn't be too bad.?  i have a 17.5' bass tracker and i have never fished there before, so i'm not really sure where i'm fishing  lovetofish"
401727,Terry,2009-11-12 18:52:00,14456,"well from picton head for the cement plant  and you are in a good starting point, if the wind isn't too bad go east  past the MNR place on the right where the ferry is and drop a second line good luck"
401732,Headhunter,2009-11-12 18:58:00,5703,"ok... a wind from the north will have a full run from Deseronto all the way into Picton Harbour. That will make the bay area, in front of the cement plant pretty nasty, should the wind have any shoulders what so ever. For a north wind, I'd suggest launching at the Glenora Ferry, which makes a north wind an off shore breeze. A 17 ft boat should fine in that area, assuming it doesn't get too windy. HH"
401742,lovetofish,2009-11-12 20:00:00,500,"Thanks guys.  My boat is a 1988 bass tracker.  If anyone sees me out there, feel free to say hello.  Was going to try to get a copy of the OFC anthem to play from my stereo, just to get everyone in the mood. lol  lovetofish"

Only problem out in the Reach this time of year is the increase of boat population and them that arent used to seeing folk with boards out...can be a real pain....aside from that the fishing is great right now. See you out there.

Let's see, we have folks staying at Perfect View, Merlands, the Sportsman in Picton, Deseronto and well probably some other places that I'm not even aware of... should we really call it a GTG or should we call it a semi-gathering?

400698,tonyb,2009-11-09 19:06:00,1637,"Fishing this past weekend was pretty slow, but it might have been the outstanding weather we had!  Not exactly your typical Walleye weather with glass calm conditions and high sunny skies!  We did manage a couple though, here's my biggest for the weekend.    Not that you guys already don't know what works, but we caught our fish on deep diving crank baits, primarily TD30 and Reef Runners, typical colours.  Good luck this weekend!  Tony  "
400729,fishhunter,2009-11-09 21:05:00,604,COULD NOT HAVE ASKED FOR BETTER FISHING WEATHER ON SUNDAY. FISHING IN A T-SHIRT AND LOTS OF FISH TO BOOT. FISH WERE ON SUNNY WEATHER PATTERN AND THEY HAD THE FEED BAG ON BIG TIME.
400750,tonyb,2009-11-09 22:08:00,1637, Good Job!  They weren't on big-time where we were trolling though
400767,fishhunter,2009-11-09 23:06:00,604,One of the biggest things I  see and hear from people is that they fish deep. Fish may be deep but the thing to remember is fish always look up.Its better to fish 10 to 20 feet above them at times and have them come to you. Active fish will rise 20 feet no problem to hit a bait. It does not always work but for me 80% of the time. Also its  the best way to ensure they dont get the bends. If i have clients that want to keep a big fish I have no problem going below 25-30 feet but if they dont want I never go below no matter how slow the fishing is. To kiil a big fish for the sake of putting a client in fish is way to high a price to pay for me. I teach all my clients that how important it is to not fish in the kill zone unless you plan on keeping that fish. I also never put a fish on a scale if its a catch and release fish. One fast pic with the camera ready before fish is in the boat to save on fish out of water time then back into the water. I try and never let clients hold fish by the gills always try and cup under the fins to ensure no damage is done. I have a tool i use to help in lifting the fish that stays away from the gills and allows me to pass off the fish with no harm to its gills. If any one needs help with set ups or baits I will try and help you out as much as I can. ill be on the water from wed till sunday working lots of water and trying some new baits I got sent to me for testing.  My boat will be leaving at 6:15 so see me before or at the end of the day. I'm on B docks. Hope everyone has a great time and look forward to meeting lots of people this weekend. Oh by the way Wayne Terry and Dano I put 3 pillows on the boat so you can all nap lol and yes you have to get up at 5am lol

We will be pulling out at 6:15 sharp each morning I'll be fishing all that week and will be able to help you out best i can. Just leave me enough room to turn left or right please  lol A little info for anyone that does not know yet.  Deep Water  Walleye and perch should be fished  relatively shallow . Fish have a reduced chance of survival if they are caught in water deeper than seven metres, brought to the surface, and then released. These fish will have sustained internal damage that will likely kill the fish, including swollen swim bladders that prevent them from submerging.  Do Not “Fizz” Fish  Fizzing fish with swollen swim bladders (poking a hole in the swim bladder so the fish sinks) does not increase survival, but causes increased injury, stress, and likely mortality."

BM
390534,HTHM,2009-10-06 02:28:00,4082,I would think Sat afternoon and evening would be the best bang for your buck.

391363,Mike the Pike,2009-10-08 22:38:00,3421, Well it would be nice if you made it Doug I know the dog is hinting about a last minute voyage to the North. Perhaps you can keep each other warm.What worries me is the last time the Redneck showed up the Wall-Ice went South.  Seriously can anyone take Doug out fishing and do we have room for Doug in someones cottage.Our cottage is now overflowing.  Doug is a good Kitchen WENCH. BTW he also loves to clean dishes.  Ah man its so far away .I would prefer to enjoy October right now though cause old man winter is coming.
391365,misfish,2009-10-08 22:51:00,29133, The dawg and doug. Say it aint so?

391702,BITEME,2009-10-10 00:35:00,1968,Alright everybody which day will be the TOURNEY
386279,JohnF,2009-09-23 17:23:00,3494," I'm cognisant of the inherent dangers of early morning boating with a late nite reveller. A little bit of exhaust stink and a nice rolling swell should set a few tummies to roiling. Perhaps the chumming will draw some trophy walleyes.  As for the trolling, well, yeah, I agree, it's sleep inducing, hung over or not.  JF"
386280,Headhunter,2009-09-23 17:27:00,5703,"John, chumming requires that you actually EAT something! I like to think of it more as ""steeping"" HH"
386288,JohnF,2009-09-23 17:46:00,3494," Not to put too disgusting a point on it, but I've seen guys hurl with such enthusiasm that they were probably creating a vacuum at their hind end. That could explain some of the solid chunkage being yakked.  JF"
386289,Headhunter,2009-09-23 17:48:00,5703,And yet another reason to wear boots! HH
386290,JohnF,2009-09-23 17:53:00,3494," Chest waders might be better. Might act as a filter during yakkage and barring an implosion trauma from excess vacuum, less mess.  JF"

386536,Headhunter,2009-09-24 13:10:00,5703,"Thanks for the help Lloyd... I really didn't need a guide at the kitchen table, but I appreciate the effort you put forth, in guiding me towards cerebral bliss... that turned into a body smack... but fun all the same! HH"

386608,misfish,2009-09-24 18:06:00,29133,"Lets get on with more important things,like,what am I spooling my reels up with? Braid then a floro leader?  Straight mono/floro?Baits and colors."
386615,Headhunter,2009-09-24 18:34:00,5703,"Brian, I'll be bringing two rods...both line counter reels on Shimano TDR rods, 8 footers. One reel spooled with 20 lb mono and one reel spooled with lead core. Guys will tell you to use braid and floro, I believe that you need the stretch inherent in mono to absorb the hit and fight...JMHO! Obviously being attached to in-line planer boards... Baits: Reef Runners (clown) Raps, Mann's Stretch 20, 25 and 30's maybe even some spoons! Hope this helps? HH"
386632,fishhunter,2009-09-24 19:27:00,604,For me  my rods(14) are 15lb power pro with 8 foot mono leaders. (4) 5 colour lead with 20' mono leaders. (4) 3 colour lead with 40' mono leaders. (4) 2 colour lead with 60' mono leaders. (4) rigger rods 20lb mono as for baits everything you have till you find the pattern. once you find it fill the water with all you have. keep one or two different to try and find a  second hit pattern if first dies. Hope that helps.
386638,Terry,2009-09-24 19:33:00,14456,"Me, I have one rod and 2 baits  that's why I go with U & Me Guide Service, always catch fish and great equipment"

380172,bigfish1965,2009-09-05 15:21:00,3382,I will try and get the time off. Thats my B-day weekend anyway. I'll go if we can find someone to blow up the BBQ and give everyone food poisoning again...the chumming the next day helped the fishing. BTW what ever happened to JP..lol.
380180,Roy,2009-09-05 16:29:00,13728," Check the e-mag, old JP is still alive and well and writing for us as well. God bless his pointy lil' ears.  Edited to add: And he should be writing for a living, he's good at it."
380188,bigfish1965,2009-09-05 18:16:00,3382,That is one of those moments that I will never forget. Got quite a few lifetime memories from these GTG's  Long live Heinrich Jumla!!!!!
380193,Roy,2009-09-05 18:59:00,13728, HAHA! A dude asked me what  the decal meant on my boat today...said he'd never heard of them. These peeps are really ill informed.
380292,fishdawg,2009-09-06 13:03:00,912, cant beat the that interchangeable diving lip..... who remember what the hot colour of '05 was??? have a good trip folks
380293,Greencoachdog,2009-09-06 13:08:00,8163,It was Egyptian Princess with the Tammy Fay Baker a close second.
380322,Dano,2009-09-06 15:57:00,719," I'll take a ride to the launch ramp over mouse feces encrusted dishes and flatware (and by extension, pillows, beds, couches, tables etc. etc.) any day of the week. To each their own."
380339,bigfish1965,2009-09-06 17:05:00,3382," Wow... I can't believe you remembered that!!! Sitting on the roof of the hotel...the birth of Jumla!  JP turning the BBQ gas on full and then trying to find his lighter...all of us backing up slowly with each unsuccessful attempt at getting his lighter to start... then all of us about 20 feet away asking him if he really wanted to do that... I think he called us a few names just before his lighter finally sparked and the lid from the BBQ landed in the parking lot..still laugh my butt off thinking about it and the 'burnt on the outside, raw on the inside' sausages he served up. Then everyone fighting the four foot waves the next morning trying not to puke..."
380368,Harrison,2009-09-06 22:11:00,2202,"I'd love to go, been a couple years since I have been to a m2Gt.  I dont have a boat right now, but have all the equipment if someone is looking for a partner.  Plus I have some knowledge of BofQ  Actually alot of knowledge.  Phil"
380370,Harrison,2009-09-06 22:15:00,2202," That was hilarious Rick!  I felt so sorry for those guys, 4 fters didnt help.  We still caught 60 something pounds for our five fish that day, thank god I said no to the ""sausage"". Playing guitar with DouG was a blast and listening to the knowledge Terry had to share around the fire was priceless."
380373,Greencoachdog,2009-09-06 22:51:00,8163,  Down here in the South we call that seasoning when it's on the cookware and Potpourri when it's elsewhere!
