402283,Fisherpete,2009-11-15 03:40:00,1814,"Headed out for one last quick muskie hunt with my brother this morning. Early on I had a nice follow by a really long and skinny fish,  but the motor spooked her as she came in close. A few more hours of casting and trolling later, just when we were almost ready to pack it in, this beauty hit my lure. She was barely hooked, so I really had to be careful bringing her in. She stayed down deep until I forced the issue, but I managed to do so without having her go on any crazy runs. She came in at 40"", and is probably the most well fed Kawarthas muskie that I have caught! She took off like a rocket as soon as she returned to the chilly 43 degree water. A few moments later I hooked another one, although smaller, and lost it shortly after.  Great way to close out what was my best muskie season ever!  "
