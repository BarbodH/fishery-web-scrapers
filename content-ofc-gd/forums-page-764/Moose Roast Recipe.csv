Does anybody have a good one they don't mind sharing?  I promise i will save you some!  Thanks  Anders  I dont have a slow cooker, so it will be all oven for me."
402706,LucG,2009-11-16 16:09:00,779,"I usually cook a moose roast as I would a pork or beef roast. But i guess there are thousands of different ways. I would like to help you out with a receipe, but I aint that much of a cook.  Good luck."
402714,Guest gbfisher,2009-11-16 16:28:00,0,same as you would cook a prime rib roast.

402730,Fang,2009-11-16 17:17:00,1330,I've doen this one before. feel free to improvise as list of ingredients is long. As long as the bacon is there it'll be fine. The other ingredients tend to be there to enhance making the gravy at the end  http://baconshow.blogspot.com/2005/07/baco...oose-roast.html

402751,anders,2009-11-16 18:44:00,1168,"Fang,  thanks for that...i saw that recipe on another site...nice to see someone tried it...i am going to try it...will let you know how it went.  And Jewel......So True..."
402755,ehg,2009-11-16 19:01:00,2666,"Try coating the roast with minced garlic for cooking once the bacon recipe is followed. You can never put to much garlic or cracked peppercorns on a roast, i would kick the salt up a notch as well. Bon appetit!"
402785,Fang,2009-11-16 20:19:00,1330,"I left out half of those hoity toity ingredients. Salt, brown sugar and just enough of the other stuff to not let the liquid get too overpowering and turn it into a poached roast.  I like to precook the bacon a bit before adding to get the salt going. hate pulling soggy bacon out of the roasting pan. I can give another 2 thumbs up for BPS Cajun marinade sauce. It's more sweet than spicy and has been working great on ribs and such cooked in the oven."
402816,walleyejigger,2009-11-16 21:48:00,876,"like stated, cook it just like you would a beef roast,  in the future invest in a slow cooker, you wont regret it for things like this  good luck i'm sure it will be yummy either way you decide to do it"

Then take a knife (no not that, the serial killer knife) and stab your roast in a variety of places . Insert a whole peeled garlic clove into the holes youve made. Salt and pepper on the moose. In a large hot frying pan avec olive oil sear the outside of the roast till brown. Put the roast in the large roasting pan on top of the onions. Add the bottle of guiness. Cover and put in the oven at 350 for 90 minutes."
