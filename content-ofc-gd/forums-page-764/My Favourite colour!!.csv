Got this big guy the other day, and he sure put up quite the battle, almost 15 minutes I'd say. Sure made my day. We definietly could use some rain though!!!  "
401904,timmeh,2009-11-13 04:17:00,609,Very nice.  You're right about the rain. Was out yesterday and it was low and CLEAR.
401938,msp,2009-11-13 14:14:00,1336,15 minutes ? A little long for a steelhead dont ya think. Nice fish anyway.....good job
401951,steelie hunter,2009-11-13 14:52:00,55," With the water being real low and super clear, and a smaller size trib, the fight will be twice as much. Everytime I got it near shore it took off in a hurry, and this went on like 6 times. It got frustrating, but finally I got my pic, and he swam off to fight another day"
402005,tributaryhunter,2009-11-13 19:49:00,108,"some of the ones i get out of the grand can be tough to get but it's all part of the fun, if it wants to go let it"
402011,BillM,2009-11-13 20:35:00,17367," I'm sure it felt like 15mins, but I am willing to guess it might have been around the 5 mins mark, lol  Awesome fish non the less, really nice colours on that one!"
402013,StoneFly,2009-11-13 20:40:00,574,"Nice Work,...like Bill Said, a 5 minute fight can really feel like much longer,..even 5 is long.  Just rmeember the shorter the better (for the fish that is)"
402017,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-13 20:55:00,0,when you've got a light leader 5 minutes is an eternity!
402021,steelie hunter,2009-11-13 21:46:00,55,"yea lol, I hear you guys, even a 5 minute fight seems like a while, as I am using a light lead but this fish went nuts, to the point where I was ready to give up. I even had to take an extended break to rest after haha. But it was all worth it in the end.  Cant wait to get back out there, if we ever get some precipitation!!!"
402137,Brettiop,2009-11-14 06:02:00,279,"I was with him when he hooked into this beast, he was doing all her could but this fish had none of it...  i know many exaggerate there fights or fish sizes, but in this case 15 minutes was an understatement...."
