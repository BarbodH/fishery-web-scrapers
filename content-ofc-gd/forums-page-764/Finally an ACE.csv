402521,richyb,2009-11-16 01:02:00,774,"I have been golfing for 14 years and have never got a hole in one untill today. Its not that I suck, im a 5 hdcp and won our club championship the last 2 years. The hole is only 66 yards but it still counts ! !!! It was a slam dunk, just flew right in with a big CLANK.   Now that I have my last golf game of the season under my belt its back to bow hunting."
402522,BillM,2009-11-16 01:03:00,17367,So how many beers did you have to buy after the round?
402528,richyb,2009-11-16 01:08:00,774,"haha , our group was the last ones at the course and they all figured they would buy me one instad."
402531,BillM,2009-11-16 01:11:00,17367, You got off easy!
402552,StoneFly,2009-11-16 01:34:00,574,bahahahahaha
402624,camillj,2009-11-16 04:55:00,1988,Congrats !  66 yards though ... geesh ... thats more like a flycast
402649,dobee,2009-11-16 14:05:00,301,66 yrd par 3??  wow thats short!     congrats on the ace!
402652,splashhopper,2009-11-16 14:14:00,2931,"  first off, congrats on the ACE...  I bet you are gonna get ribbed to death on that pitch shot though!"
402653,JohnF,2009-11-16 14:15:00,3494," You've probably drained longer approach shots.  But there's just something about an ace, isn't there? My son's been a pro since age 18 and in 14 years has never had one.  Congratulations. JF"
402660,Toronto_Angler,2009-11-16 14:50:00,698,  You got lucky...after I had my ace the club house was packed and the beers were flowing...almost made me dread getting another one lol
402827,dobee,2009-11-16 22:05:00,301,"forgot to mention i got my first ace this year at rebel creek outside of kitchener... 177yrd par 3 (8th hole).. i did luck out with the drinks, i was in a twosome and the members ahead of us were the only ones that felt like drinking that day"
402901,richyb,2009-11-17 00:16:00,774,"  Yes I have drained lots of longer approach shots but nothin matches the feeling of a hole in one. My longest is 260 yds , made a 2 on a par 5.  AND HEY !!!!!!  its a tricky 66yds"
402978,Leecher,2009-11-17 02:24:00,7832,Congrats on the ace richyb Nothing like seeing your shot go right in!!! I've accomplished that too.... a 156yards shot that landed on the front of green and roll across right in The funny thing was that a storm was coming our way and could hear thunder in the distance.... just before the swing.... saw lightning     The clubs were retired after that accomplishment.  Again great job richyb and good luck on the bow hunt!!! Leechman
402979,JohnF,2009-11-17 02:25:00,3494, 260!!! I'm impressed.  Tricky as in you had to suck it back 40 yds with a sand wedge???  JF
