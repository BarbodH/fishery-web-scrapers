402500,Twocoda,2009-11-16 00:19:00,4130,a friend of mine had one of those contraptions in the early 80s ...same idea but the platforms were made of wood...i tried it and made it through three bags in the time i could have tied at least ten by hand....he offered to give it to me for free...i declined as i couldnt see the need for one  i wonder if it was because of the broken egg juice soaking into the wood the reason they now make them in stainless....what a reek !  roe bag tying is a chore that you must be able to do without a machine ...i find myself lately tying on the banks of rivers...because i have been experimenting with curing formulas
402501,BillM,2009-11-16 00:22:00,17367," You time yourself when you make bags?  I didn't realize I had a time limit when I sat down in front of the couch.  Tieing roe bags is serious business!!!  It's pretty self explanitory, you really need me to explain it to you?  Lay net on top, put eggs in, pull lever, tie off bag/cut.  Done.  Ultyma316:  I just secure it to the table/whatever with 3 strips of packing tape.."
402503,StoneFly,2009-11-16 00:24:00,574," Thanks for posting that,...I see what it is now,...For me personally it has no use, not that it has thing to do with the machine, but did you see the size of those stumps Granny was leaving on the tied bags,..lol....bigger than the bags themselves,...also with spider wire there is no need to tie a knot,...Im betting I can tie better bags faster with my fingers than I could with that machine any old day of the week.   thanks for confirming it is for the half blind and feeble,..lol"
402506,StoneFly,2009-11-16 00:30:00,574," Yes I have timed myself,...just to work out the Math,..Sorry Im a scientist, cant help it,..lol, but apparently you have also.  Now after seeing that machine in the video,..So hilarious that it was Grandma using it,...I can indeed see who it was invented for Blind, feeble and sausage fingers,..lol,...mine are half way there, but I have dexterity.  Bill why do you sit in front of the couch instead of on it?  I like to watch TV or talk on the phone with earpeice in while I do it.  Does sitting on the floor help? lol"
402508,BillM,2009-11-16 00:35:00,17367," Whoops, that would be sitting infront of the TV!  lol  Watching that vid is painful, I think I would have had a bag tied before she even got the spoon out of the container!  I'll rip off a 100 in an hour the next time I sit down, maybe more... just for you."
402511,Twocoda,2009-11-16 00:40:00,4130, tell ya what ..ill supply the spawn and netting ....could ya rip off a 100 for me too???? man i miss my son !
402513,StoneFly,2009-11-16 00:48:00,574," Now your talkin,....but seriously,..Im not Jammin the device as Im sure it has its use for some poeple,....Is that how you learned to tie so you just stuck with it?  Im having difficulty with the benefits?   Im curious, no Jabs for once,..lol, Wait that wasnt your wife in the video was it? lol...Just kidding."
402514,MJL,2009-11-16 00:48:00,2427," Could speed tying roe bags be the next Olympic sport? I’d spend 30 minutes of my life watching it and cheering on some of Canada’s finest  As for the bags that the lady was tying up with the machine, in chartreuse or hot pink, I’m sure they’d be deadly in stained water…Could save you from needing yarn for added bulk and silhouette fishing double double  When I tie bags, I usually sit in front of the TV and watch the hockey game…Doesn’t matter if it takes me 10 minutes to do a few dozen bags or 3hrs to do the same amount…I’m there anyway watching the Leafs get destroyed"

402518,StoneFly,2009-11-16 00:54:00,574," lol,..However if it is 11pm after finalizing the plan during touch and go weather and you are getting up at 5am,...time is definately a factor, for me atleast,..I usually try to have well over a hundred in many sizes and colours at the ready,...but in sept/october its usually a different ballgame.  not sure about your comment on the stumps,...that logic would suggest yarn soaked in Roe juice,..hmmmmmmmm, interesting,...might have to try that"
402519,trevy727,2009-11-16 00:56:00,351,"? 1 liter of eggs is probably over 1000 bags. i don't keep my fish, so to me it's worth it. 1 liter will last me all winter and spring."

402382,Twocoda,2009-11-15 15:22:00,4130,any tackle shop ....but also try petro canada ...if you know where your going ( post the area) someone might pipe in and tell you if there is a vending machine in the area   
402383,uglyfish,2009-11-15 15:25:00,981,"fishing world, bills bait and tackle, grimsby tackle all have some"

402405,[email protected],2009-11-15 16:19:00,290, Awesome.  I knew there was a store there but I had no idea what it was called or where it was.   Guess I'm headin to the dam again.  I'll be the guy with the yellow tacklebag + green/orange vest + steelback hat
402407,kemper,2009-11-15 16:32:00,2232,Tying your own bags is definitely the best bet....maybe you know someone who can give you a hand?  Those store tied bags are terrible...seem to be more plastic then eggs
402426,BillM,2009-11-15 18:00:00,17367,Buy a spawnee tieing machine and some netting..  Doesn't get any easier..
402454,vinnimon,2009-11-15 22:35:00,2593,
402458,StoneFly,2009-11-15 22:45:00,574,"Definately learn to tie your own.  The store tied ones SUCK for the most part and they are freakin expensive, I know a store that charges $7 for a dozen salmon bags, you could go through a dozen on smolts in 20 minutes, those roe robbin little buggers, lol.  Tying your own means you can manipulate size, shape and color for different locations and conditions.  Even if you dont have any of your own roe, you are far better off to buy it in bulk, buy 3 colours of mesh and the spider thread and all of that will cost you about $40 from which you can tie about 300-400 average size bags.  So even if you only got 300 for $40, thats only $0.13 per bag, where as if if you paid only $4 for a dozen, thats $0.33 per bag (or at the store I reffered to $0.58 per bag).  From Bulk container and packaged mesh to tied bags in a container in the firdge I tie about 60 per hour, which is probably average.  So the math dictates you should save ATLEAST $0.20 per bag and if you tie 60 per hour, which is only $12 savings for an hours work from the cheap store or $27 from the expensive store, so dont do it for the math.  Although the Math does get a little better when you harvest a chinook and have enough for a whole season, lol.  Do it for the quality and versatility, its really not hard, once you tie one or 2 you wont look back.  Also try to think about who was tying them at the store....they could have been smoking all day or picking their ass while tying your roe bags,..Them troots wont like it.  There is the possibility of minor satisfaction when you tie your own as well and land a nice fish, similiar, but to a much less degree to the flytier guys who tie their own vs. buying them for $2.  P.S., once you really get into this sport, if you do,..you will find alot or other ways to spend your money than on pre-tied roebags."
402467,vinnimon,2009-11-15 23:11:00,2593,"Like stonefly had mentioned.once youve  tied two or so your on your way.Experiment with colors and sizes.try different curing proceess.I have three that works great no chemicals at all.Some store bought are good if your a regular,ussually what is given is whats out of a piss jar.I know caledonia tie there roe that day or the night before.I had no issues."
402469,BillM,2009-11-15 23:13:00,17367,No steelheader goes without one of these  
402470,fishinguypat,2009-11-15 23:15:00,547,"i used to have trouble with it but it depended on what i used...do you have soft eggs?big enough netting? tying thread can be magic thread or elastice string from a crafts store...i prefer regular thread but it is much easier with the regular when you don't cut them before they are tied...wrap around 5 times, overlap the line and put the yarn holder through and over your netting and your done one"
402471,vinnimon,2009-11-15 23:18:00,2593,"If the wife say that she would use it tying up something else.  Need to go fishing,its my peace and quite time."
402472,StoneFly,2009-11-15 23:19:00,574," what the heck is that contraption?  if its for Egg tying, how many does it do per hour?  reminds me of those kids in school who couldnt roll joints, so they had a cigarette rolling machine,..lol."
402477,vinnimon,2009-11-15 23:25:00,2593,"What ever you do,dont let the wife see it,on ebay etc.she'll tie up my sacks with it."
402480,BillM,2009-11-15 23:28:00,17367, LOL!!!!!!!!!!!  How many per hour depends on the user   I can rip off a dozen in about 10mins...    Makes tieing dozens of bags at one time extremely simple.
402481,vinnimon,2009-11-15 23:29:00,2593,seriously now ive seen one years ago and didnt know what it was for.are they still available.
402484,vinnimon,2009-11-15 23:38:00,2593,"I prefer to tie by hand,my average is 65 to 72 an hour, including prep time.after three hours.what i find at bait shops is they tie them too loose and cure quick.They make the kids tie them,seen that too often."
402486,BillM,2009-11-15 23:44:00,17367,"I can make all kinds of cool colour combinations, I like doubling up the netting if the water I'm fishing is going to be dirty... Every little bit helps!  Definitely do it youself!  You can never blame the bags in that case though"
402487,StoneFly,2009-11-15 23:45:00,574," Doesn't that equate to about 60/hour?  where is the benefit?  are they better quality?  I highly doubt it!!!   must be some drawbacks?  I usually do 2 sets of 30,....ok start the clock...lay out newspaper,..lay out paper towel,...lay out 30 squares of colours I want,...take my plastic spoon and drop any where from 1 to 6 eggs, depending on my plan,...then tie em up one by one, snip me all at the end.  Its kindof like a production line.  tell us how your Contraption works please....  I need to hear more about this device, if it doesnt produce better bags faster, then is it made for the half blind or feeble? lol,..or whats the story? I have a buddy that doesnt see the greatest so he uses some sort of hook tying device,..I've never looked to closely at it, but all I know is I retie about 10x faster and probably better with one eye closed, lol."
402490,vinnimon,2009-11-15 23:58:00,2593,"years ago there was a bait shop in hamilton by the tracks,the owner couldnt see a thing but when he tied roe not one egg was missed,and all were tied well.no contraptions needed."
402493,MJL,2009-11-16 00:03:00,2427," Here's the machine in action.   As for the way I tie roe bags, I have one of those orange Melnak Bait makers for tying bags up with.  I got one for Christmas when I was 12-13.  I threw away the metal gate thingy and just use the hole in the orange plastic base.  Put your sack material over top of the hole, put eggs in the middle, shove the eggs down into the middle of the hole with a finger and the mesh or scarfing folds up nice.  Grasp the sack material just above the eggs, twist once and tie off with spider thread a couple times.  Cut or snap the thread off and cut off excess sack material.  The guys at the local shop have a roe tying table and do it this way...They've got 50 holes on their table to put mesh and eggs over which speeds things up even faster.  Sure faster (at least for me) using the baitmaker base to fold the mesh up than trying to fiddle around with it on a flat table or the palm of your hand.  As other guys have said, it's a lot cheaper to tie up your own bags and far more versatile."
402495,[email protected],2009-11-16 00:08:00,290,My dad lent me that machine  It seems very 'unstable' though.  I think he forgot to give me the bottom piece.
