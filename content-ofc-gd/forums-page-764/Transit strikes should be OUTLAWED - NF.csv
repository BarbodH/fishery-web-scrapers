402953,irishfield,2009-11-17 01:47:00,26272,No Woodsman... there is always THREE sides to every issue. The employee.. the employer.. and the real facts somewhere in the middle.

Oh yeah, I know... it will come from the ""savings"" of not having to pay the HOSTAGE TAKERS for the time on strike and the savings from not putting fuel in the bus..... but then again... there is a loss of revenue for this time as well and the those darned banks just don;t understand that the loan can't be paid for the bus this month and the insurance company is putting pressure on too...  but hey.... we, the government employee, don;t really care about all that real world stuff... we want our god given right to a raise and we don;t give a dang who gets affected nor who has to pay for it...."

402987,bigfish1965,2009-11-17 02:38:00,3382,"I am not in favor of unions, but trying to classify transit workers as essential is over the top, IMHO. Firemen, police, EMS and even water treatment and sewage treatment are essential...but bus drivers?? No chance. Toronto relies far more on its transit system and they manage to deal with strikes. It is inconvenient yes. Does it directly put people at risk? No. A 15% raise seems generous given the economy, but I don't know the ins and outs of it all..it may be making up for past concessions...no clue. The city is within their rights to hire out and get replacement drivers if they wish to. Some bus companies may even come in and pick up the routes. If there is a buck to be made, someone will be there. It is just a possible strike, not the end of the world."
403028,rob v,2009-11-17 04:12:00,535,"Wow... to me this only goes to prove one thing... figures lie and liars figure.    Bottom line - they want more money and it has to come from the fare users and the tax payers.  I'm not completely up to date on the finances of the LTC but my guess is the tax payer is subidizing this service - and the rate the users pay is only a portion of the over-all cost.  so .. once again the tax payer forks it out.   And there's plenty of LTC customers who don't pay the full fare - or any fare at all.  If the union isn't happy with the city's offer - which I think is fair especially given the current economic climate.. go get a different job - just like most of the other folks out there.  And I'm sure there's plenty of CAW members in the area (St thomas isn't that far away) who either are or will be very happy to put their name in the hat for one of these ""under paid"" positions.  Just makes me shake my head, and wonder where this kind of thing will ever end."

403052,Woodsman,2009-11-17 09:45:00,1286,"For all those who are anti unions I'm sure you would be willing to give back all the benefits that unions were pivotal in getting as the normal. Give back your holidays & vacations. Health benefits gone also. Health & safety rules forget it. Decent pay?, $4 per hour sounds about right. Your work week would be a lot longer also with no time or energy left for fishing. To those who would say "" the unions did nothing for me in getting what I get"" or ""government laws give me these things"" no employer would offer these things or government legislate some of these things if the weren't the expected norm. For those who own their own businesses how would your businesses fare if the disposable incomes of Canadians were to drop drastically? I'm sure you are quite willing & happy to accept a portion of these unionized workers disposable income. If they have less you'll also get less. The leisure and entertainment industry would quickly see major drops in spending as would the service industries. When money is short people tend to do as much of their own work as they can or friends can help with. Corporations would expect to only pay $4 per hour without benefits which would leave no money for employees to put back into the economy. Think this is not true? Then why are some corporations moving jobs to Mexico for just this?"
403059,Jer,2009-11-17 11:47:00,1426,"  Where in this dispute has anyone been offered less? Seems like some pretty unreasonable drivers looking for a raise that no one else seems to expect in this day & age. Comparing bus drivers to police, firefighters, EMS, etc. is laughable. They drive a bus for godsake."
403061,Chris,2009-11-17 12:12:00,405,"The fact that some gov't. employees are trying to justify bus driver salaries of upwards of 100K/yr just shows how out of touch with reality they have become. They actually believe it in their heart that their salaries, benefits and demands are justified. Believe me I have 3 sisters and one brother who all have gov't. jobs, and no matter what numbers you show them, they are still convinced that their salaries and benefits are fair and justified. When backed into a corner, they always revert to the common mantra of gov't employees........""if gov't. jobs are so great why don't you go out and get one"". The other side of the coin is ""if you, as a gov't. employee, feel so hard done by, then YOU go and get another job"". Maybe try the private sector and see what kind of compensation packages the people who pay your salaries have. Might just be a real eye-opener.  I have a friend who has worked in the mail room at Statscan for about 6 yrs. and makes about 40K/yr and he complains that he sits there doing absolutely nothing for most of every week. When he does have something to do, it's stuffing envelopes. With no post secondary education, he has full benefits, retirement plan, all kinds of time off each year and (the big one) job security. I work with several guys his same age (late 20's) that have been through post secondary school in engineering related fields (drafting, CET's, etc.), that have been working since leaving school that make approx. the same salary, half the benefits, half the time off, no pension and they work like buggers to meet deadlines. Oh, and they have absolutely NO job security. In fact several of them have been laid off or are working reduced work weeks during this recession. Yeah I know, ""if they don't like it, go and get a gov't. job"" yadayadayada.  One word....ENTITLEMENT....No wonder the taxpayer is doomed. We are second class citizens in this country."

402812,Woodsman,2009-11-16 21:42:00,1286," As I said earlier they have the above have the right to binding arbitration. Give the bus drivers the same & there would be no strike. That's all there asking for if the city & union can't come to an agreement. To say ""You can't strike"" but ""also you can't have arbitration"" is complete Bull. It's either one or the other. It's obvious that the city is trying to play ""the out of control union card"" while not trying to settle the issue & invoke public outrage. This will backfire in the long run. It's time to tell your local politicians to either have the city go back to the table or agree to binding arbitration. Without one of these 2 options the strike will never be settled."
402813,walleyejigger,2009-11-16 21:46:00,876,"wow, why are you assuming that the union wants to go to arbitrarion because it will not be fair and they will get what they want. Ever think that maybe the city is trying to make them take it up the rear, and they're looking forward to arbitration for a fair deal.   Of course not just make up your own propoganda. Salary isn't the only part of a job.  All i'm reading here is a crapload of jealousy. If the job is so easy and not worthy of anything then feel free to apply and get that ""cushy"" job. I wont be there.  Until a full story comes out to the public on each  unionized strikes (show me the entire contract, language and all, not just what either side wants to tell us about, which will never happen) people should think twice before judging.

402841,splashhopper,2009-11-16 22:27:00,2931,"  Not sure who this is aimed at... but I will respond  The lead negotiator for the union said : he ""was looking forward to arbitration""  last week.. He was on the local am talk radio show that i heard him say it. The guy ( Pat Hunniford)  can't get his numbers ( wages and benefits etc) straight from talk show to talk show..  He thinks if they go to arbitration that it is a slam dunk they will get what ""other cities "" are paying their drivers... How fair is that if we are compared to cities with 2-10 times the population base( see tax base)?  this ""arbitration"" is not very arbitrary  The city has posted their offer to the union online >> http://www.ltconline.ca/  The bus drivers want ""parity"" with the EMS teams here in London...  and ""feel"" they are entitled to the same benefits package for their jobs.  Listen to the talk shows when the Union representative calls in... it's almost laughable how they represent themselves.  In the posts that I have on this thread, I have not made an issue with what they are making.. I AM making an issue of their ""bargaining"" tactics... which holds an ENTIRE CITY ( the bus riders and their NEW drivers now) HOSTAGE...  The city will eventually cave in.. we know that in our logical brains... but at what cost and to whom and how ? The mayor came on the same talk shows and shared her disdain for the ""arbitration "" process as well.  I say,, lets figure out how to settle this ASAP in town... or lets fire every damned one of em and take on this ""arbitration system "" once and for all..  London could be a leader in this FARCE and I will do whatever I have to do to get my daughter to and fro from University.  And, in today's paper:  THE DISPUTE  * London Transit  Wages/benefits: Offering six, staged wage hikes worth 8.3% during a three-year contract plus some benefit improvements.  How top pay would change: For drivers, to $25 an hour from $23.08 now; for skilled workers, to $29.02 from $26.81.  Bottom line: Including benefits, the offer would cost an extra $2.7 million during three years.  * Amalgamated Transit Union  Wages/benefits: The union had sought a 15.2% wage hike for drivers during three years and 12% for skilled workers. Including benefit improvements the union wanted, the LTC says it would cost an extra $6 million during three years.  Bottom line: The union says LTC drivers are paid less than drivers in some smaller Ontario cities, and workers' benefits lag civic employees in London. The LTC employees, which include about 340 drivers and 110 other workers, voted overwhelmingly against the last offer."
402842,splashhopper,2009-11-16 22:29:00,2931,  i agree ..
402853,Woodsman,2009-11-16 23:02:00,1286,"And she's done this on every labour dispute including police & firefighters. Whats new? To settle it quickly I agree. As I have seen this similar comment in this thread more than once; Re:""or lets fire every damned one of em and take on this ""arbitration system "" once and for all.."" if anyone believes this is even an option they are either hiding their head in the sand or living at home with mommy as they are not even capable of wiping their own rear end.

402860,splashhopper,2009-11-16 23:11:00,2931," you are one funny guy Rick....  The mayor at least comes to the talk shows and brings a reasonable voice to these negotiations... she is well know for being reasonable..   Not sure what the personal attacks to me are about though...  My view point is partially based on my personal situation with my daughter, yes. It is also largely based though on a union that can take 75- 80,000 daily riders ( and now their personal drivers) HOSTAGE."
402865,Dutchy,2009-11-16 23:16:00,416," Maybe it is, maybe it isn't but the point he makes is correct. Holding an entire city hostage while turning down an offer most people would accept is crazy. I admit, I earn a much higher salary than these guys do, but I have never had an 8% pay increase, never mind 15%. Get into the real world here. The LTC has said it will have to increase transit fares by 15% to match the offer they want. Its simple economics. Everyone who has to use the buses gets screwed to keep 350 drivers happy. Not real fair (no pun intended). The money has to come from somewhere and in the end someone will always suffer in some other form (tax-payers).  The economy sucks, lots of people are out of work. These drivers need a reality check. This is not the time to demand huge wage increases. Accept what is a good deal and wait for the economy to get better. I don't mean this to sound nasty, but they drive buses. End of story. They don't save people's lives or run into burning buildings. Salaries have to match job level. Its very simple economics."
402876,Woodsman,2009-11-16 23:31:00,1286,No personal attack intended. I'm just stating what appears to me.  Best Wishes: Rick
402891,Radnine,2009-11-16 23:52:00,1538," The above may be a little harsh but the sentiment is probably sound. Remember that the media's job is to get you irate about things like this so you will tune in to find out the latest. Percentages of raises and benefit gains etc. are seldom as actually reported. I would also ask everyone to look at your own situation and say ""you know what I get paid plenty for what I do, I never want a raise again"" Won't happen. It is human nature to want to better your own lot in life and if it isn't then you've got a bigger problem than waiting for a bus. Jim"
402893,Woodsman,2009-11-16 23:55:00,1286,"A few of points here. It's not a 15 % increase but an increase over 3 years. If you take the city's figures as complete fact ( I'm not inclined to) this would decrease the yearly increase to 5 %. You should also realize this is not just a wage increase but an upgrade to benefits that other city employees receive. Also if the compensation package added up to 15 % why would this add up to a 15 % increase in transit fees?  Does the compensation package make up the whole cost of the transit system? I think not. There's upkeep to vehicles, new vehicle purchases, fuel, insurance and administration costs to name a few other factors. It's the city playing the big bad union card. ""Its very simple economics"" is it not? I  won't even touch the "" I don't mean this to sound nasty, but they drive buses. End of story. They don't save people's lives or run into burning buildings. Salaries have to match job level. Its very simple economics."" as you seem to believe they are below the standards of needed services."
402897,splashhopper,2009-11-17 00:00:00,2931,"  Umm lets see... .when fuel went thru the roof  last year,,, they raised the fees...  and now if the wages and benefits go up by 15% they somehow magically don;t have to come up with 15% more money to cover it?  not sure how that works.... let me know how to do it please... your math seems different than mine."
402916,Dutchy,2009-11-17 00:48:00,416," It might be a needed service, but that does not mean that there should be huge salary increases just because the drivers and union think they should get one. The job is what it is, if they don't like it, go get a different job. What they are doing is pure blackmail. ""If you don't give me what I think I should get I won't do my job"". I have no sympathy for it at all. There are tons of people out of work who would jump at the package these guys have, but no it isn't enough for them.  And your point about the 15% increase.........If a current bus pass is $79 then it is going to go up by 15% to cover the costs. That is going to be about an extra $12-13. BUT not everyone pays full fare (Pensioners, students, children), so a 15% increase in those fares won't be nearly as much. So when you factor in everything, then it probably is what is required to cover the increase in the compensation package."
402935,Woodsman,2009-11-17 01:21:00,1286, It is simple math. If the compensation package was the total of all costs involved in the cost of the bus service than yes the transit fees would have to increase 15 %. A few factors that effect that are: 1: Only a third of the increase will be applied each year. 2: These are the city's figures which I believe are not completely accurate. 3: Many other costs contribute to the total cost of the service. To blame to total increase on the contract demands is false. A common tactic of employers is not to factor the # of employees in each wage group into the % calculations. For example. IE: 85 employees at $15 10 employees at $19 5 employees at $26 Employers stated average wage $20.00. Were if you factor # in each category it's an actual average wage of  $15.95. If all employees get a 2% increase than  it's a 2 % in increase in wages. But many employers will use this formula when reporting to media. 2 % at $20 = $.40 average  increase in wages. when actually it's  2 % at  an average increase of $.32 with #'s of employees factored into each wage category. Statistic's are only as accurate as they are calculated and reported.
402936,Woodsman,2009-11-17 01:31:00,1286, I never stated it was a 15% increase. That was someone else. I said if the city's figures could be believed it would be 15% over 3 years or 5% annually. I don't know what your getting at? 15% is 15% no mater the #'s in each group. Dollar amounts may differ but 15% is 15%. It's just like the #'s of employees in the lower wage group are far higher than those in the higher wage groups.
402938,splashhopper,2009-11-17 01:32:00,2931,"  did u read the offer that was posted... it broke the wages down .... and furthermore laid it  out, with simple math the cost of each sides proposed increase in package....a pretty big number either way ... that money has to come from some where ."
402944,Dutchy,2009-11-17 01:40:00,416," It simple, if you are paying $40 for your bus pass, then a 15% increase would be about $5-6. If you are paying $79 for a bus pass, then it is $11-12. That is, there is not one price for riding the bus in London. The majority of users (students) pay less than I or you would as adults. So it maybe a 15% increase across the board, but it is not at the same dollar amount as not every bus pass costs the same amount of money. It depends on how much you pay for your bus pass. For example, 100 people paying $40 = $500 extra cash from 15% increase. 100 people paying $79 = an extra $1000  from 15% increase  So I am guessing that a 15% increase across the board taking into account that the majority of users do not pay the full adult fare = cost of compensation package.  Hopefully that makes sense. The total dollar amount that is brought in by the increase depends on the % of people who pay full fare versus the % of people who don't."
402567,splashhopper,2009-11-16 02:05:00,2931,"Well the unions are gonna have their way, yet again, with the tax payers in the city of London..  I say this after the head of the local union made comments on the local AM talk radio station Friday that he was LOOKING FORWARD to Arbitration.  Insinuating that the arbitration board will not be fair and they will get what they want..  what do they want you ask?..... SIXTEEN PERCENT increase ( wages and benefits combined) over 3 years !  This in a city with the second highest unemployment rates in the entire country... the tax base falling out from under us... The city has offered them 8.5-9 % over three years.  Seems reasonable in these uncertain times to me...  see here>> http://www.ltconline.ca/  Hell, they are getting a damned good package as it is to DRIVE A BUS   ... There are lots of unemployed eligible truck drivers that would LOVE to have the security of these guys packages and be home at night with their families !  The strike is going to DEBILITATE OUR CITY.... we have 65,000 post secondary students alone in this city of 350k !  My daughter is in her 3rd year at Western and has staggered classes all week,,,, sometimes she doesn't finish class till 10pm.... some days she is at school for 8 am....  She relies on that transit system like so many other working people here...  I think the transit systems in ALL  CITIES should NOT BE ALLOWED to strike.... they should be considered an essential service just like the EMS  teams...  At the end of the day,  the union now has the city by the short and curlies and the city is in a NO-WIN situation..  If they give in to the RIDICULOUS demands of the union, they are NOT doing their jobs as administrators of a city in financial stress.  If it goes to arbitration, our drivers will be compared to cities like Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa etc... How UNFAIR is that? The cost of living is not as heavy here as those other cities.... so why should we be expected to pay the same rates? (I personally made a decision to NOT return to Toronto after a business loss here in London a number of years ago and that decision was due to the HIGHER COST of living that I endured for 13 years there previously.)  The arbitration ""system"" in this province needs some SERIOUS review and oversight of PEOPLE  that know the value of of a dollar and understand an open market trade system.  As of tonight, my wife and I will be trying to coordinate rides to the opposite side of the city for our daughter classes, DURING OUR OWN WORK SCHEDULES!  We are somewhat fortunate in that we have two drivers in the family.  But....  What about the families that don't ?  What about all the workers that don;t have cars ?  What about the students?  What about the environment?    My bottom line here....  TRANSIT SYSTEMS should NOT BE ALLOWED to strike...( see hold ENTIRE communities hostage !)"

402669,wallyboss,2009-11-16 15:13:00,1095,"Hopefully the Strike isn't as long as the one we went thru last year in Ottawa.   Traffic was mental.  I agree that they shouldn't be allowed to strike, they might not be essential to everybody, if the bus is your only way to get to work you might be in trouble. There was a story about an elderly woman in Ottawa, a new immigrant that had finally found an overnight job in a grocery store to be able to survive,  but that store was across the city from where she lived, on the bus she had to transfer 3-4 times. She couldn't afford a taxi everyday and had no friends that had a vehicle, it used to take her if I remember well 4-5 hours to walk at a very slow pace(because of her age) in the middle of January. So she was walking 4-5 hours to work,  worked her 10 hour shift, then walked back home. sleep 4 hours and do it all over again. She didn't want to quit her work as she said she would've had to go on welfare and she didn't want do that.  after a month and a half, one of the local newspaper wrote a story on her and people started to offer her drives to and from work.  But to the transit drivers it was more important for them to make more money.  Some had year salaries over $100,000(with all the overtime) not too bad for 4 years of University?? (bit of sarcasm entered here)."
402675,splashhopper,2009-11-16 15:26:00,2931," Hell, if the drivers had University degrees,  I would have to seriously wonder WHY they are driving a bus? No offense to any University educated drivers here.... but really, come on... it doesn't take a BA to drive a city bus !"
402686,Woodsman,2009-11-16 15:41:00,1286,  I just don't get it. You want to prohibit strikes but you also don't want binding arbitration. Essential services that are prohibited striking have the right to binding arbitration. You can't have it both ways.
402691,splashhopper,2009-11-16 15:48:00,2931,"  I didn't say i don't want arbitration... i said there needs to be a review of its process..... comparing ""living cost allowances"" for Toronto vs London is ridiculous."
402705,Woodsman,2009-11-16 16:09:00,1286,This strike is going to end one of 2 ways. Either the city goes back to the table offering a little more or it will go to binding arbitration eventually. Arbitration will most likely cost the city more. The only way this will be a short strike is if the city agrees to put more on the table or agrees to arbitration with the provision that the union returns to work in the mean time. It's in the city's hands now and being hard headed will only prolong the strike.
402709,Fishnwire,2009-11-16 16:20:00,983,"Simply deming them an essential service and taking away their right to strike is not the answer.  Look at the police union in Toronto.  They're not allowed to go on strike, but I lived down south for years and every time their contract came up they made huge gains.  If anyone questioned it, they were reminded how the police were an ""essential service"" and as such, worthy of whatever raises, extra days off and perqs they were asking for.  Not having access to a service you're used to sucks and I don't blame you for being mad.  I'm not sure what the answer is but what you're suggesting won't work to your advantage in the long run.  IMO anyway."
402713,Dara,2009-11-16 16:24:00,3052,"I don't think any government services should be allowed to strike. Call it a condition of the cash for life job. You don't like it...don't work there.  And somehow, MP's and MPP's should have raises voted on by the public"
402723,FLEX ROD,2009-11-16 17:05:00,394,"I will spell this out,  If they go on strike, people can not get to work, if people can not get to work they can not make money, if they cant make money the government can't tax and collect, and if the government does not collect tax money the 16% is USELESS TO THEM BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT HAVE A JOB!!  So yes they definitely should not be allowed to strike.  FLEX"
402732,Headhunter,2009-11-16 17:25:00,5703,"I would ""Regan"" them all! HIt them so fast they didn't know what happened to them... isn't funny how those in the public service feel that they are ""entitled"" to anything they want?... with no care what so ever to the ramifications of their actions, on others. Regan them, -plain and simple. HH"
402734,Dara,2009-11-16 17:42:00,3052,"  We get taxed anyway, and as soon as they get a raise, we get taxed more to pay for it...the money for government is endless"
402736,FLEX ROD,2009-11-16 17:48:00,394, You could not be be more correct and though in a Maggie for good measures.  FLEX
402739,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-16 17:54:00,0,"in the original post you say ""Hell, they are getting a damned good package as it is to DRIVE A BUS"", making it seem like what they do is no big deal, then you go on to say it should be an essential service?  so which is it?  they are clearly VITAL to the lifeblood of your community and should be payed well as such.  perhaps they are asking for more than you want, but what group of workers WON'T do that if they can!  just look at the auto unions!"
402744,spinnerbaitking,2009-11-16 18:22:00,1622,!  just look at the auto unions!   & look what happened to them Rishard
402762,splashhopper,2009-11-16 19:12:00,2931,"  ummm.. if you are going to quote me,,, maybe put the entire sentence in so that it isn't taken out of context >>>  ""Hell, they are getting a damned good package as it is to DRIVE A BUS dry.gif ... There are lots of unemployed eligible truck drivers that would LOVE to have the security of these guys packages and be home at night with their families !""  I don't get your ""point"" with the auto unions....  unless of course that was tongue in cheek... and we all know what is happening to those overpaid unions now."
402763,Headhunter,2009-11-16 19:24:00,5703,"Doc... I understand where you are coming from, I think... I thought that way as well, when I was young and hadn't gotten tired of over paying for everything. I have gotten to the point I am now, based on paying huge income taxes, huge property taxes huge _______ you fill in the blank, for decades. I feel like I am trying to fill a black hole, with money. The more I give it, the more it needs... So Doc, with that little bit of perspective for yah, can you understand the frustration many of us feel when we are under the impression that we are yet again, getting hosed. There is only one true comparisson, between driving a bus in Toronto, (where I live) and driving a bus in London (where I grew up) and that is that both are driving a bus! You simply can't compare driving in London, to driving in Toronto...PERIOD! In a time when most people's incomes have been slashed, to ask for, no strike that, DEMAND that kind of an increase, jsut goes to show the mind set of the ""entitled"" FIRE 'Em ALL! (Aesthetically speaking of course!) HH"
402766,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-16 19:25:00,0,"clearly you acknowledge that they are very important as you suggest they should be an essential service, yet you don't want to acknowledge that is what gives them the bargaining power and dictates that they should be well compensated.  i'm not necessarily siding with them but stating they are SOOOOO important actually gives them more power.  pointing out how much this disruption affects you empowers their cause.  i'm not sure where i stand on it...i saw the ottawa transits strikes reek havoc on friends there, so i know how much these disruptions hurt.  that said, when it comes to these disputes i always take the side of the worker over the government or a corporation.  i also don't like talk of taking a workers right to strike away.  you definitely won't win that argument with me.  i'm a public servant and without these rights to bargain and strike my wage would be even lower than tradesmen, autoworkers, and others."
402769,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-11-16 19:34:00,0,"hahaha...headhunter...i'm working on my ""old man"" bitterness right now. i certainly never have any money and i'm learning the ropes of the gov't tax bendover...especially when i watch friends who barely finished highschool make more than i do in trades etc.  that said, these drivers are looking out for themselves, something we all do with regards to our work.  i'm not agreeing with the bus drivers, i'm merely disagreeing with the notion that they shouldn't have the right to negotiate their own salaries.  both sides have a responsibility to the public to meet and the table and develop a satisfactory resolution."
402770,splashhopper,2009-11-16 19:41:00,2931," I am acknowledging that they are an essential service and THAT is waht gives them bargain power.... but that power is lop-sided when it holds other people HOSTAGE who cannot do a damned thing about it.... ie... the tax-payers  I don't always take the side of the employee ESPECIALLY when it comes to the ""entitled"" culture of government employees.  I have no issue with bargaining for better packages.... but NOT when it holds people hostage that cannot affect the outcome of the bargaining process.  To ""always take the side of the employee"" ( see rest of sentence above).... suggests to me an anti-authority complex and be damned with the consequences of innocent HOSTAGES as long as ""the man"" doesn't get his way.  There are real people getting their lives disrupted here today and for however long this strike will last.  This is not some theory that we are all gonna lay out pros and cons for and write up a thesis...  At some point there has to be a shakeup of this ""entitled mentality"" of government workers ( Maybe do as another poster here suggested and ""Maggie Thatcher"" them) and let the chips fall where they may... how bad could it really get? Reaghan's planes are still flying and the UK's country didn't fall apart.... when those LEADERS took a stand against HOSTAGE TAKING."
402774,Headhunter,2009-11-16 19:49:00,5703,"Doc, the bitterness will come! Trust me, especially when you get to a point in life where your long standing ideals have been beaten to death, by those who we empower to do good on our behalf. HH"
402792,Dara,2009-11-16 20:47:00,3052,"  What about Firemen, Police, Nurses..they can't strike and they do ok.  The service the bus drivers provide is essential, but it doesn't take a PHD to do the job so why should they be paid as one. College proffesors are again about to go on strike. Should our children put their lives on hold so these people can make a few bucks more? I'm getting tired of it. Companies are going bankrupt from too high taxes and pensions are being lost in the process, but bus drivers are entitled..come on..lets get Rae Days back"
402795,FLEX ROD,2009-11-16 20:56:00,394,"  Dara, as one that is employed by the public sector, if as mentioned ""Rae Day"" or two is required so be it, I a, grateful to have a job and if that means it stimulates the economy the so be it. But, what we need is some logical decisions being made by the people who allegedly know what they are doing.  FLEX"
