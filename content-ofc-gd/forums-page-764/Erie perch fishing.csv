Things seemed slow so we headed south and found a good school west of Grubbs Reef. We were the only boat on the spot and it did not take long to get our 100 (9""-13"") keepers. It was a very soft bite and they did not want any resistance. It was a beautiful flat day on the water and you could run anywhere you wanted. We fished next to some nets so becareful if you are out there.  Looks like we will be having some water chicken tonite !  "

402823,Bob Devine,2009-11-16 22:02:00,251,"I am glad I use the electric knife, it makes it so much quicker and easier. It took less than 1.5 hrs to get them done by myself. Even though they are smaller than walleyes I find I have to be move careful as not to cut thru the backbone. The average walleye about 20"" takes about 15 seconds to clean. Lotsa practice with the knife and actually have an American Angler electric that I bought in 1993. It has 2 speeds and and low speed works great for perch cleaning."
