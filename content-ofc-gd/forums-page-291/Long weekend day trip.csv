I want to try and target something new and different then the normal bass and crappie. Not really interested in carp or cats either. If anyone knows a place within 2 hours of caledonia that you could suggest it would be greatly appreciated! I have waders and a canoe with a motor, so Lake Erie and ontario are not an option."

800685,Broker,2013-07-29 13:10:00,482,I would but I'm not really sure where to go about that. The only place I know is almost all private property.
800754,Joeytier,2013-07-29 17:25:00,3990,Lots and lots of public water within 2 hours with residents.  Check out the upper reaches of the gbay tribs
