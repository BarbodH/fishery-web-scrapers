Then it stopped.  First thought burried in the weeds.  With  the rod bent over and drag screaming, knew a ski was on.  After a minute the line went slacker and the front half of a smallie came up.  Tough world down there I would say."

800225,mike rousseau,2013-07-26 17:25:00,4661,Happens to me every year...  Never actually saw one ripped in 2 pieces tho... Just cut up a bit...
800226,BillM,2013-07-26 17:58:00,17367,"Smallmouth as bait, the new hottest muskie craze!"
800232,jimmer,2013-07-26 18:36:00,2730,Nothing more crazy that bringing in a small fish and the line suddenly stopping! Oh Oh I have never seen one cut in half out of all the times it has happened to me though.
800233,BillM,2013-07-26 18:44:00,17367,Perhaps the OP was fishing where there are sharks instead of muskie.
800234,Rich,2013-07-26 18:52:00,3927,"Snapping turtle? Cormorant? ... Clean in half it must have been a 5"" smallie for a musky to do that.."
800236,Tayzak15,2013-07-26 19:24:00,318,Happens up north all the time except its when we have small walleye on and the bigger pike come chase them to the surface
800237,OhioFisherman,2013-07-26 20:00:00,6623,"I recall one trip to Pointe Au Baril, some guys were leaving when we arrived and they showed us the fish they were taking home. One was a 19 - 20 inch largemouth and from the gill plates back it was slashed to hell. Dude what happened to that one, a huge muskie grabbed it, it didn't let go until it got close to the boat."
800238,Bassassins,2013-07-26 20:17:00,111,That is crazy!  A fun little story for sure... We have seen big bass hitting overly aggressive smaller bass we a reeling in.  Must have something to do with the increased heart rate and the panic that makes it seem like an easy meal???
800239,bare foot wader,2013-07-26 20:19:00,1354,"had that happen quite a few times on the Ottonabee river, usually the smallies come to the boat with big cuts and their guts hanging out...one of them all I got was just the head and gills of a 13-14"" smallie  it got to happen so often (couple times a week the one summer) we began to wonder if muskies follow the boat the way seals actually follow boats and steal salmon  I grew up fishing a small gravel pit for largemouth and they are fairly cannibalistic too"
