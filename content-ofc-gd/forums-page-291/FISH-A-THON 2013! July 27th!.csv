800338,Fish Farmer,2013-07-27 13:10:00,2234,Wish I could be there. You guys deserve a pat on the back for running such a great event.
800459,asdve23rveavwa,2013-07-28 12:16:00,2690,"Another great day, with over $12 000 (still growing) raised I'll let Dan and Ryan fill in the other details. Juli and I will be posting a photo, and maybe some video, report soon. LOTS,and I mean LOTS, of photos to go through. Much love to all our friends at the Fish - A - THON crew!!"

800782,Rich,2013-07-29 21:14:00,3927,"You guys have the most incredible event I visit every year. The sponsors involved donating copious amounts of prizes are unmatched by any charity event I've seen. I believe Ryan said the same thing at the awards ceremonies. I've watched this thing snowball into just a heartwarming and amazing thing. I can't thank the Fish-A-Thon crew and their sponsors enough, as well as all the pledge getters and volunteers. Wow.  Everyone, make the time to come out next year."

799996,Loonietoon,2013-07-25 00:59:00,1450,Looks like I am not going to make it again this year.. Son has to go in and have his foot operated on as he broke it 2 weeks ago and it is not healing properly. Any one going that lives in Hamilton can pick up or I can drop off some prizes that I have would be great..
800001,danbouck,2013-07-25 01:14:00,4380,I still need to visit Spiel before I head down.
800006,Loonietoon,2013-07-25 01:37:00,1450,Dan you are not to far from my place to Chris's that's for sure

800175,The Urban Fisherman,2013-07-26 02:37:00,2050,Hey Guys!! Thanks so much for everything - I have SO much updating to take care of in the morning!!! haha it's been a wildly crazy week for me!  Thanks for the support and look for an update in the morning!
800182,d_paluch,2013-07-26 03:03:00,343,Can't wait man! Be there tomorrow afternoon sometime. Any idea if we can leave a boat docked overnight?
800193,Rich,2013-07-26 09:11:00,3927,"Yeah, just tie it to a tree. Nobody will pay any mind. I'd keep it within viewing distance though. Haha"
800215,The Urban Fisherman,2013-07-26 15:35:00,2050," Yep - What Rich said.  You're good to leave your boat in the water buddy - just not at hte main dock.  Try to find a spot on one of the small docks.. Mine will be in the water you can even tie onto it if you want.  The boat will be fine, but don't leave any rods or tackle down there overnight."
800216,The Urban Fisherman,2013-07-26 15:36:00,2050,Calling for RAIN still guys! Try to come prepared just in case the weather man is right and we get that rain they're calling for!
800219,d_paluch,2013-07-26 16:28:00,343,"Thanks Ryan,  what site do you guys have? I don't remember ours but Rachel and I will go for a wander once we get the tent and everything set up!"
795704,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-30 15:18:00,2050,"Happy Canada Day Weekend Folks!  I hope everybody is away for the weekend, enjoying family, friends, a little fishing and maybe even a few cold ones...  We usually try to wait until 1 month prior to the Fish-A-Thon to really start the big push as we want to keep everybody excited and the train rolling right up until the event!  So here we are to bug you guys for the next 4 weeks!  I really should hire one of the great writers of OFC to put these threads together for me as I never seem to be able to get the words out properly.  Here's a little background info for some of our new members.  We started this event as a way to raise funds and awareness for a cause that I think has touched each and every one of us in some way - that is the fight against Cancer.  It seems like just yesterday there was a dozen of us on the dock, pledges in hand that were collected from family, friends and co-workers - ready to pitch lures for a full day on the water.  We aren't walkers, joggers or bike ridding kind of people... we love to fish and wanted to do our part.... So the Fish-A-Thon for a cure was born!   We put that first event together in just a couple of weeks and with the help of so many good people here on OFC and elsewhere we pulled off an awesome day and raised way more then we had anticipated.  Fast forward to Fish-A-Thon 2013 and we're celebrating our 5TH ANNIVERSARY already!  We've had hundreds of participants young and old, thousands of dollars worth of prizes and food donations given to us from businesses and individuals all over, have raised over $35,000 towards the fight against cancer, raised awareness online, on radio and in print, shown time and time again just how solid of a group we are as anglers, and have a new generation of fish-a-thoner's aged 2 and up who are excited to take part every year and find new ways to help others.  As stated in the title, this years event is on July 27th 2013 and located once again at the Deer Creek Conservation Area in Norfolk County.  We have participants come from all over Ontario and have already collectively booked more then 10 sites at the park!  Right now our participant numbers are on par with last years with 70+ people signed up, however we do have more children then usual at this point so we're hoping to push more people to get involved as participants!!  We have what I consider to be the greatest sponsors at any fishing charity event.  They step up year after year and donate an unbelievable amount of prizes for our participants!!!!  That being said, we're always looking to partner with new companies and individuals that share the same passion and values as we do at Fish-A-Thon for a cure.  If you think you can help our event in any way please do not hesitate to contact us!  Our participants work selflessly to gain pledges, going door to door, asking friends, family, co-workers and employers for pledges which are donated to fight this cause, and we want to show them as much appreciation as we can.  More importantly, the larger we grow as a team of individuals and companies, the more strength we have to make a difference!  Please feel free to take a second to poke around our website at www.fish-a-thon.com - Dan Bouck did a great job putting the site together for us and has all the information you need to get involved.  Coming up soon with be some DCCA fish pictures to get you guys stoked about the fishing and some sponsor thank-you's for those who have already stepped up for 2013!  A big FAT ( Fish-A-Thon) thank you goes out to our amazing team of people who donate their time behind the scenes every year to make this happen.  You guys know who you are and I can't thank you enough!  This honestly just straight up wouldn't happen without you! More to come!  THANKS!  Ryan   "
795706,The Urban Fisherman,2013-06-30 15:24:00,2050,"I've posted each of these photos year after year but they are a solid group of pictures that some of you may not have seen, of some quality fish are are available in the reservoir!  If you guys have any special Fish-A-Thon photos from past years please feel free to post them!    Species Available:        "

795933,Spiel,2013-07-01 18:43:00,9065,"I'm still uncertain as to whether or not I'll make it this year Ryan but the donation prize rod will.  Should be done in a few more days. Here's a quick peek at the custom cork and wood work I've done thus far. A few more guides, custom signed  ""Fish -A-Thon 2013"" and we're off to the races.  "
795951,d_paluch,2013-07-01 20:56:00,343,"cannot wait for this again this year. Somehow I have yet to register, but Rachel did a while back, time to get pledging!  This has turned into my favourite fishing event of the year, and without a doubt is one of the best days on the water I can think of. We have a site booked for the 26th so we don't have to leave Oakville at 5am anymore"
796428,The Urban Fisherman,2013-07-04 14:31:00,2050, Your rods are always a hightlight and coveted prize at the Fish-A-thon Spiel - we can't thank you enough!

797372,danbouck,2013-07-09 23:07:00,4380,"Hey Everyone,  I can't add much more to what everyone has said. For those that have been you know what it's about and how much fun is had. For those that haven't... It is an awesome day filled with fishing,food and fun while raising money to fight Cancer. On top of it all everyone walks away with an awesome prize pack. Last year we had over $10,000 in prizes to give away.  As Ryan stated we are still looking for more sponsors and mainly more participants. We almost have the campground filled with only 6 campsites left. There is also another campground 10 minutes away and 2 more in Long Point 20 minutes away so everyone can make a weekend out of it.  I will be there Friday to Sunday and expect to sit around the fire with some OFCers both nights. Maybe have a pop or 3"
