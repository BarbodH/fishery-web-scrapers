800241,leaf4,2013-07-26 20:57:00,2466,"Dunno if anyone cares or listens to them, but I've been a long time listener and it seems so random and out of the blue. Everyone had assumed he was on vacation until it was a week and a half into it and people started asking where's Todd? then at the end of the show Dean broke it down and said he was no longer with them, and their producer got the boot too, from the sounds of it Corus is doing some re shuffing, first Jason now Todd makes me wonder when they're going to say cya later to Dean since Todd was such a huge part of the show.  here's a blog that does explains a bit better http://www.torontomike.com/2013/07/todd_shapiro_leaves_dean_blund.html  I for one am gonna miss Todd that's for sure, met him a few times great guy not actually the d0uche he portrays himself to be lol"
800246,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-26 21:48:00,10439,I just want to know what happened to Pete & Geets.  DOH!!! Just found out Pete died in 2011.
800247,fishing n autograph,2013-07-26 21:49:00,2540,Wow that show is gonna suck now. I listen to it every day shift
800248,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-26 21:52:00,10439,Luckily it's off the air by the time I get into work in the morning.
800249,BillM,2013-07-26 22:06:00,17367,Show started to suck after Jason Barr left.  I pretty much stopped listening to it.
800250,SirWhite,2013-07-26 22:07:00,210,Really? I haven't even noticed lol. Yeah it's gonna be different cause Blundell isn't really all that funny and the banter between them really made the show.
800252,Pigeontroller,2013-07-26 22:17:00,2793,Some of the stupidest raunchiest attempts at humor I've ever heard...
800253,timmeh,2013-07-26 22:24:00,609,...
800254,timmeh,2013-07-26 22:26:00,609,"hmm, somehow deleted my last post?  Wonder who the new cohost will be?"
800255,fishing n autograph,2013-07-26 22:31:00,2540,Probably blind derek
800256,LefroyFisherman,2013-07-26 22:33:00,602,"I don't mind Derek in small doses, Dean is such an ass... I listen to the Biggs and Barr show more in the last few years."
800257,dhickey,2013-07-26 22:37:00,1038, Good luck  to them all I hope Dean is next.  Then I might start listening on the drive in.
800260,Meegs,2013-07-26 22:54:00,249,"No more toddy tickles? what the hell, thought he was on vacation, missed last part of show today, this is first ive heard of this. Todd has come a long long ways from when he first started on the show, stupid humor but still one of.the.few things that help get though the day"
800261,SirWhite,2013-07-26 23:03:00,210,"I haven't gone through the different radio stations in years. I find the show entertaining. I often take an extra second while working to listen to one of the many funny stories every day. Psychic Nikki, what's wrong with you, and pickin on Bieber makes me laugh. And all the random news about f'd up sh$t is the only thing that makes me smile before 10am.  The call ins with the wierd homeschooled kid that always yelled at them and spoke nonsense about himself. Was classic.  A month ago they ran a news story about a neighbour finding three woman trapped in a house one had a baby and they had been missing for years. Blundell ran the ""hero' s"" interview over and over. Hilarious. Look it up haters."
800267,fishing n autograph,2013-07-26 23:18:00,2540,Dead give away
800269,jedimaster,2013-07-26 23:32:00,3472,"Honestly they have been telling the same bum, lesbian, barf and poop jokes for the last 7 years. I stopped listening a long time ago."
800270,Steve,2013-07-26 23:32:00,2075,"97.7 for me.  jason was always my fav on the DBS.  now that he's hosting the show with biggs, i think he's much more in his element.  tickles will return ---- somewhere."
800301,irishfield,2013-07-27 02:51:00,26272,"..dumb and stupid... but they sure helped me laugh and weave through traffic on College St every morning, on the way to Mount Sinai. Especially Wednesday's ""what happened"" womens day..."
800451,kuhaman,2013-07-28 04:40:00,503,Bring back Humble and Fred!!
800725,Believer,2013-07-29 15:54:00,40, If im not mistaken i think it was due to a government decision about statements he made about a woman protester at a rememberence day parade being hit by a man. He basically said it was a good thing because she was protesting at a rememberence day parade etc etc. but the CRTC found it was condoing voilence against women.
800727,Fisherpete,2013-07-29 16:01:00,1814,Say it ain't so!  WHAAAAAAAHAPPPPPEN?????
