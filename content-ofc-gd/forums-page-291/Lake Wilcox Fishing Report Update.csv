There's lots of kids swimming in the beach area and lots of novice anglers who tend to get their lines tangled or snagged."

798077,okumasheffield,2013-07-14 15:32:00,318,years ago I was told fishing from the canoe club was prohibited
798080,GrenadierPond-HighPark,2013-07-14 15:39:00,16,I was fishing from the public dock. There's a boat house that has two docks that says no fishing on it. So it's fine to fish where I am.
798094,redpearl99,2013-07-14 16:40:00,259,there's actually a by-law banning fishing from that area (the sign is beside the dock).  You're only permitted to fish from the south shore.  Nice fish though!
800455,bobogo,2013-07-28 11:44:00,76,is it legal to fish from a boat in wilcox? I plan on bringing an inflatable to paddle around and take some casts this week.
