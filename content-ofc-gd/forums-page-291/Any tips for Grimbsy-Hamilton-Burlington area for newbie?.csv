800706,Raycaster,2013-07-29 14:34:00,528,First time out launching from under the Skyway bridge and zig zagging the Hamilton/Burlington edges.  We trolled about 2-4 miles out 35' to 65' but had a very hard time even marking fish. We had the dipsy divers and wobblers running and trying to stay with any fish marks depth.  Do you usually have to go deeper or is it day by day that you just have to go find them?  Gotta say even with no hits it was still enjoyable and a good change from casting all day.  Thanks for any help guys.
