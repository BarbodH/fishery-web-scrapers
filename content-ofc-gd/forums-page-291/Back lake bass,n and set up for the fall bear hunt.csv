800367,misfish,2013-07-27 17:57:00,29133,"Was invited by RyanMc, to help set up for this fall bear hunt,and in return for helping,I was shown a back lake bass spot. Hunting and fishing,cant beat that.  What a nice peice of land this was. Drive for miles,many roads going all over in many directions. GPS is a must here.  We decided to play first,then set up the bear area later.  At our parking spot,I came across a turtle hatch. It couldnt of been more then a few days old.    Then we seen a pile of bear skat. Lots of fur in it. Looked like deer hair.    Got an hour of fishing in. We just fished from shore. Will bring the tube and canoe next time.  Bass were hungry . Senkos and slammers.            Play time was over. Time to pick a spot to set up the bait. Looking for a high ridge close to a swamp was the plan. That way,the bear could be dragged down hill with ease. LOL  Lots of moose tracks and this one was big.Get all the gear up the hill and get started trimming a shooting lane. Saw down a tree to put some logs around the barrel. Set up the bait barrel,load it up and get it ready for action.    Took a short video. I guess the climbing up the hill didnt allow the camera to focus properly.        "

800395,Rustic-Fisher,2013-07-27 20:38:00,826,"Great morning , and definitely will throw the canoe in the truck next time , as well as some top water baits ."
800407,porkpie,2013-07-27 21:27:00,2521,Hope you chained that barrel to something!!!  The bears will roll it off your site otherwise!!  Looks like a fun morning!
800410,misfish,2013-07-27 21:38:00,29133,"It was strapped  real good,but ya know bears,they rip anything apart. Cant wait to get back up there and see whats what.."
800428,Rod Caster,2013-07-27 23:35:00,5784,"I was cutting/flattening some hunting lanes today too! Looks like a nice spot out there, especially with bass fishing from shore like that."
800448,4x4bassin,2013-07-28 04:01:00,1025,"Yep , looks like a good spot . You guys are going to have to get a boat in there next time !"
800457,solopaddler,2013-07-28 12:10:00,8605,The back lake looks great!  Looking forward to the report with a canoe.
800464,kickingfrog,2013-07-28 13:26:00,8333,See any grouse?
800500,misfish,2013-07-28 15:23:00,29133, Not a one Rob. We were very surprised. Ryan was saying theres been little sightings this year.
800503,kickingfrog,2013-07-28 15:30:00,8333,I think the numbers are/were expected to be more in the middle of the cycle but I haven't been seeing too many either.   I am all wound up to get back at it after too many years away. May have to go father north.
800508,TJQ,2013-07-28 15:48:00,7806,Can't beat a day like that!
800590,Rustic-Fisher,2013-07-28 21:38:00,826," Yep it's looking to be a less then banner year for grouse in the WMU's I frequent . June was brutal on them. Still you never know , foilage is so thick most birds would be invisible untill flushed . I'll have a better feel for what's going on  around us once I can run my GSP in the woods again, still the risk of him disturbing chicks and every other animals new offspring . R"
800828,chris.brock,2013-07-30 01:13:00,4053,"looks like a great day, nice report"
