800909,chris.brock,2013-07-30 12:17:00,4053," my back is getting better, I'm still stiff, self medicating at the cottage helps though (Hahaha), doctors say to keep moving so that's a good excuse to move through the bush and then move into a boat  I've hurt it before, sometimes it takes up to 6 weeks to heal  Martin gave the green light for exploring his new lake, but I don't have anybody that is up to the challenge to go in with me"
