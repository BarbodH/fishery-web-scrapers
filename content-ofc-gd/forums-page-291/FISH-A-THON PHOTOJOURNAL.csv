Once, again, a year of planning came to fruition yesterday with the fifth annual event.  The less than perfect weather in no way spoiled another stellar day! Smiles were found everywhere, and, the fishing overall was probably the best participants have experienced in the five years.  Quite a few decent bass/trout and panfish were landed. As for $'s, the final count is not yet in, but, we are over $12 000 raised!!  Ryan Bonin and Dan Bouck will chime in with $ amounts/fish sizes and sponsor thank-you's (although I will give a big shout-out to Laurie at Dixie Tackle here!!!) and any other pertinent info.  Thanks to the rest of the team, Ryan, Dan, Ginny, Sam, Shawn, Stephanie, Tom, Angela, Ashley, Suzie, Bob, Mike, Danna, Albert and ANYONE else who helped in any way.  Juli and I are thrilled to be part of one heck of a winning team with an extremely positive attitude!!!  It was great to see so many familiar faces, as well as a bunch of new ones including some OFCers such as Christopher K, a young man who has embraced this forum.  The following is but a small portion of the 700 + photos that Juli took throughout Friday night and Saturday.  I will post a link to ALL the pics once they are uploaded to Photobucket.  Anyone wanting to share/print etc, will be able to have copies of photos of themselves.  I will also post this link on the Fish-A-Thon website.

I hope you have your shoulder in good working order as all the last three trips the musky only wanted the new 12's. I would switch up all different baits but the mammoth has there number.   Thanks again for all the hard work that went into the event this year and the past years"
