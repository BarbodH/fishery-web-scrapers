799998,Weeds,2013-07-25 01:04:00,782,"Can anybody tell me what year that motor would most likely be just from the decals and  this picture? Thinking about buying this boat, not sure what year the motor is though..guessing 87 or 88 maybe?"
800000,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-25 01:12:00,10439,"Yep, looks like mid to late 80's."
800002,Nipfisher,2013-07-25 01:15:00,2449,Nice deep boat.
800004,Tim Mills,2013-07-25 01:31:00,476,I have the 6hp late 80's or early 90's.
800023,wormdunker,2013-07-25 10:51:00,1711,"Get the serial # from it, call a reputable marina, they'll be able to identify the year.  Probably even search it on line."
800030,Fish Farmer,2013-07-25 11:26:00,2234,Like wormdunker said.
800044,Fisherman,2013-07-25 12:51:00,7201,"Nice boat, if you get it, put the larger 12"" tires on the trailer, props almost on the ground, then tie a 50' piece of rope to the motor, there's your anchor."
800104,Weeds,2013-07-25 17:54:00,782,"Thanks for all the replies guys. Didn't see anything resembling a serial number when I looked at it, maybe I just need to take  a more thorough look.  Not a fan of these motors, or just figure it'll get bashed to hell on that trailer?"
800115,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-25 19:02:00,10439,"The serial number should be on the motor bracket on the right side when looking from the rear.

800146,Weeds,2013-07-25 21:54:00,782,Thank you sir
800148,Fisherman,2013-07-25 22:06:00,7201,"Not a fan but to each their own.  Anyway, you may also find the serial number embossed on the motor block somewhere under the cowl.  Unless you tilt the motor up, looks like the skeg is pretty close to the road.  On second look, I would rather have a high transom model,  any substantial waves following you might just wash in on the back."
800217,SylvanOwner,2013-07-26 16:06:00,266,"I have an early '80's Merc 25 on my boat and I'm going to say that one ""looks"" like even older styling but certainly the serial numbers are the way to get it done....decent little rig, imho."
