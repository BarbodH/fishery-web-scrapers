800282,dhickey,2013-07-27 01:17:00,1038,In a nut shell. Ive never been one to float fish on a lake.  But I have 5 days coming up and thought I might give it a try. Im pretty certain where they are (pike) But they  always eluded us except for the odd 4-6 pounder dragging minnows through weeds.  I like the idea of using a slip float to suspend a 5-7 inch  minnow about 10-15 ft down on drop offs with weeds.  So. Are there floats out there that can do this? And where can I pick them up on short notice? GTA Heading out next Wednesday .  Has any one tried this? In mid summer?  Any input appreciated.  Thanks. Don.

As in, down with the lake trout in 60+ feet or water.  Fish a six-inch minnow down 15 feet and you'll likely catch some nice largemouth though, and probably a few decent walleye mixed in."

800315,sauce,2013-07-27 03:48:00,219,Sail has large slip floats.  Not sure of their largest but they do have 16 gram. I'm sure most tackle shops will have some slip floats. Just maybe not the size you want. Probably 16 gram or more...
800320,manitoubass2,2013-07-27 04:25:00,11391,"Go against the "" rules"" and look for the bigguns just out of shallow bays with a drop off. If you find sand, at the right time they'll be sunning real shallow"
800345,OhioFisherman,2013-07-27 14:48:00,6623,"If you can't find commercially made slip floats any craft shop usually has smooth finished Styrofoam eggs or ball that can easily be turned into a float large enough for very large minnows or suckers, and even perch where legal.  You can fish a slip float deeper than 10 - 15 feet, suckers as bait tend to seek out the bottom, to small a float and they will keep it buried. Chubs and other minnows tend to wander various deeps, a small weight is usually needed to keep them in the desired depth range.  A bait fish in distress attracts attention of predators, some times it's nice to kick back and let them do the work."

800357,redpearl99,2013-07-27 17:00:00,259,I use these floats  They can handle 6 inch suckers no problem
800468,Rich,2013-07-28 13:47:00,3927,"People who float fish caledonia for walleye use large minnows and deal with heavy current mixed in. They use large plastic tube like floats they call ""piker floats"".. i guess they were originally designed for the situation you describe.  Might be something to look into."
800612,limeyangler,2013-07-29 00:09:00,5204,"Any shop that sells steelhead tackle should have some Drennan floats.....try a Drennan Piker they come in either 6,11,20,28,or 40 gram  http://www.fishusa.com/Product/Drennan-Piker-Crystal-Pike-Floats"
800615,singingdog,2013-07-29 00:34:00,1047,Really? I guess all the pike we caught today in 8-10 FOW - within pitching distance of 40 FOW - aren't paying attention.
800633,dhickey,2013-07-29 02:35:00,1038,Thanks for the good advice guys. You have given me some good things to work on.(think about) I know they are there(pike) its just getting the big ones out to play?  Thanks. Don.
800707,Raf,2013-07-29 14:43:00,3495, Q: What's the difference between a pike from 8-10 fow and one from 30 FOW in the middle of summer  A: About 20 pounds.
800747,bare foot wader,2013-07-29 16:58:00,1354," this is true  if you have a downrigger, drop the ball down with a big sucker, nose hooked, on 20' of line and slowly drift with a sock or two out...set the hook quickly, maybe fish barbless too....deep water outisde of bays, deep drop offs, ledges, saddles/humps, etc....look for deep water near feeding areas"
