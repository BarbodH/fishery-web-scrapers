If I am reading this correctly, my 17 nephew will not be required to purchase a license to fish as long as he's with me while fishing? He's a U.S. citizen and coming up for a portage trip I am planning for next week.  Can someone confirm this hasn't changed please. Thanks!  Non-Canadian residents under 18 years of age may fish without a licence if accompanied by a person who has a valid Ontario-issued recreational fishing licence (or deemed licence). Any fish caught are part of the catch and possession limit of the person who holds the licence."
