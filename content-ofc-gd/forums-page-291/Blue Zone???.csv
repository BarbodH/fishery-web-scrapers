800229,bucktail,2013-07-26 18:15:00,1857,Has anyone been fishing the blue zone this year? Its that time and I wanted to know if its firing out there yet. I usually run about 20 miles ESE of Oakville but with runs like that having a little pre info is appreciated.  Thanks  Darren

800271,Steve,2013-07-26 23:36:00,2075,"the cold(er) than average Lake Ontario temps have kept the bluezone from really setting up....  normally its a pretty warm surface then a good temp break 25' to 40' down - that's where the trout stack up (as well as the ho's).  this year the temp breaks are not as evident ... yet.  if your looking for bows, for some reason the west end of lake ontario, hamilton to bronte, has been on fire, with many double digit rainbow outings going on right now...  just run spoons in the top 40'"
