Started early Saturday fishing for Walleye.Our big fish was 30"", with seven walleye over 27"".  While we were trolling we got a  perch on a dipsy diver and got second place on Perch!  Dipsy divers 90' back and leadcore seven colors with worm harnesses were the hot ticket.  We had our 12 fish limit in three hours.  Great day........   "
