Not long after he pulled in a nice pickeral, followed by a small bass that popped off at the boat. I only had a couple bites. It was choppy and cool with some strong winds but its always nice to get out on the first day."

I am wondering if anyone could give me a few pointers to pass on to my dad and brother to get them started. My brother has a 19ft boat and is taking it with him. They will also have a my brothers young kids with them so a panfish spot would be great to know also. Thanks for your help if your interested. I have never been there so I am no help whatsoever. Matt"
