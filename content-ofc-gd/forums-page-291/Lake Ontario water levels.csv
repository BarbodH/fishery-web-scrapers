800868,John Bacon,2013-07-30 03:34:00,3277,"We may have a new water management plan for lake Ontario Water levels.  http://metronews.ca/news/toronto/751428/new-water-management-plan-could-have-lake-ontario-rising-and-falling-dramatically/    A new system of water management that will mimic the natural seasonal levels of Lake Ontario could win approval next year, but property owners on the shoreline say the plan could ruin thousands of homes. After a five-year, $20-million study and $360,000 in public and technical hearings, the International Joint Commission — a Canada-U.S. body that manages shared waters such as the Great Lakes — is poised to recommend the plan to federal authorities. The current lake-management system aims to keep lake levels within a 1.2-metre range, depending on the time of year. The new system would mean there will be both higher and lower water levels than now. But that means homes on the shoreline will face an increase in erosion and risk of flooding.  Conservation Ontario and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority have given the plan their blessing. But property owners are worried their homes, sewer systems and flood-insurance premiums will suffer under the new plan, says Dan Barletta, a member of the Lake Ontario Riparian Alliance. “This plan is awful,” he said at a recent hearing organized by the IJC. “It is beyond imagination that you are considering it.” Bluffer’s Park marina owner Ross Merikallio says he isn’t holding his breath about the new plan. When it comes to water management, he says waiting for change is “like waiting for the Scarborough subway.”"

Lake Ontario will be so low they'll never need to worry about flooding or erosion!  20.36 Million dollars to tell everyone they'll let nature take care of the level fluctuations!"

You build a house by the water sooner or later you're going to get wet. You step in a cow pattie your foots going to stink, you eat jalapinos, your butts going to burn, etc. I say too bad so sad."
