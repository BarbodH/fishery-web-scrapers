799887,jimmer,2013-07-24 17:00:00,2730,Who said I don't want a bassboat????? I said anyone can buy one and people shouldn't assume that they know how to drive the things because they have one. Maybe they should make a boaters operator's card the real thing so people actually have to know the laws and how to operate a boat. A test that is required to drive the other vehicles you mentioned. Driving a full throttled bassboat within 20' of a stopped boat is not safe. Dead fish!
799890,frodobuggins,2013-07-24 17:07:00,127," Do i seriously need to explain how the 9.9 might require less energy to operate than a 200hp? This has always been my favourite argument from the people who see themselves as outside of the problem...that because some other thing exists and uses gas (9.9) then by extension, the 200hp is no different. Why don't you make a GoPro video of you gassing up and driving around the lake? I'm sure it would be a hit.     So you don't think there should be a central body that could oversee all tournaments to make sure that no 1 lake is being fished too much, especially with multiple tournaments at the same time? Christ, i need a permit to use a baseball diamond for an hour practice, surely something can be put in place to limit tournaments in ontario.  That's fine you dont't see it that way. Don't mistake my disagreeing with you or having this particular opinion as zero knowledge. As i said previously, i used to own a bass boat and fish tournaments. I know first hand about all of it."
799892,GbayGiant,2013-07-24 17:13:00,1780,C&R should be banned. No one should fish unless they keep and eat what they catch.  Then we would not have stupid topics about dead fish floating around.    JMO.

A full throttled other vehicles will do the same, I had so many sea doo guys come out of nowhere to wave and smile 10' away from me while I was parked (almost dumping me in my 14' tinboat).  Maybe people will not label you bass boat hater if you would just remove ""bassboat"".  lol"
799908,jimmer,2013-07-24 18:28:00,2730,"Okay, everyone was talking bassboats, obviously any watercraft that has a dangerous driver is a concern. Guess I have to be more careful with my wording. LOL I would love to be able to afford a bassboat!"

800365,Dave Kennedy,2013-07-27 17:51:00,1,"Hi everyone, I just read this topic and thought I would give a response to the question of impact to the local tourism.  I fished both one day tournaments on the weekend in question and will give you first hand my expenses.  First off, I live in Huntsville. I have a two and a half hour drive one way to get to Peterborough so it costs me on average $175.00 in fuel for the truck just for the return trip back to Huntsville.  For these particular events I spent three days of practice. The weekend before the event my wife and I went to Peterborough and stayed in a hotel. Hotel costs were $202.00. Fuel in the boat was approximately $100.00/day. While in Peterborough we spent close to $200.00 in meals for the weekend(I had to take my wife to the Keg for making her sit in the boat all weekend  ). The weekend of the tournament I spent Friday on the water practicing then had a tournament Saturday and a tournament Sunday. Return trip from Huntsville $175.00 Hotel costs were another $202.00 Fuel was the same, approximately $100.00/day. Meals and misc. expenses were approximately $200.00 for the three days.  My totals for these tournaments is around $1,654.00 with approximately $1,300.00 injected directly into the Peterborough area. These numbers do not include my entry fees or the time my tournament partner spent on the water or the money he spent in the area. He was on the water for four days of practice.  These are just my expenses so I could definitely see some extra money coming into the community for the weekend with all the anglers as a whole.   As far as the article that was in the local paper that is something I certainly don't like to see at all and cottagers certainly have a right to have some questions. Our tournaments were on the Saturday and Sunday. Those fish in the picture look like they had been deceased long before those days(but that is my opinion and it may be wrong. I am not a biologist) As a tournament angler I knew ahead of time it was going to be a very hot weekend so we prepared ourselves for that. Each morning four bags of ice were purchased and used throughout the day to keep the water temperatures from skyrocketing in the live wells. My live wells also have oxgenators in them that keep pumping in fresh oxygen all day long. At the end of the day it is harder to get the fish out of the live well because they are in such good shape. Also, because of the heat we did not target any smallmouth bass as they seem to be affected more in the extreme heat while in live wells.  The tournament organizer takes a lot of care and effort in making sure the fish are healthy to be released and I believe the anglers as a whole participating in these events make the same type of effort.  This type of topic can have many opinions and can get heated. This is understandable. The one common thing I see in this thread is that all the people involved care about the fish...........and that is a good thing!   I hope this helps with some of the questions that were asked.  Dave Kennedy"
800382,pics,2013-07-27 19:42:00,1268,I wonder if someone had them in a live well until they started to go belly up? Then threw them back with the hope that they would recover...
799582,FloatnFly,2013-07-23 00:32:00,1640,don't forget about commuters going into and out of toronto on a daily basis at near idle speeds on the 401
799654,fishindevil,2013-07-23 09:12:00,6254,Ok the real question is tiller or console ????? This thread has derailed big time ........
799655,Stoty,2013-07-23 09:47:00,2910,"Anyone who thinks that us ""tournament"" guys are a bunch of knuckle-heads, environment-destroying fish-killers, is a MORON. Us ""tournament"" guys probably do and know more about the conservation of fisheries than any of the tree-huggers out there that are throwing rocks....  And what does the type of boat have anything to do with it? I'd put money on it that WAY MORE fish are harmed/killed from (less experienced) fisherman than from guys in bass boats. Typically people that run bass boats are dedicated/hardcore fisherman that are EXTREMELY concerned about the conservation of our fisheries."
799658,Rich,2013-07-23 10:04:00,3927,"Typically from what I see people who run bass boats are people with a lack of fishing ability that just want the glory of looking professional.  ""Professional bass fishing"" .. really that sounds funny.  However there are the actual tournament guys. The guys that bought their bass boat and every piece of equipment surrounding it for a specific purpose to do with bass fishing. These guys are conservationists. These guys follow rules. These guys take care of the waters and respect other anglers. And these guys DON'T throw back floaters."
799748,jimmer,2013-07-23 20:07:00,2730,"The passion lives on! I have just found that the Kawarthas are getting very busy of late and that puts everyone on edge. People jump all over seeing dead fish after a tournament, which we all hope that the tournament is not at fault, but like others have said; the meat hunters are the ones to worry about. I have my own pet peeves about tournaments, but they are not illegal, so not much I can do about them. I do find myself visiting other lakes during the busy times."
799769,Steve,2013-07-23 22:10:00,2075,"I think the REAL question is, should there be a governing body (or something similar) that will stop FOUR tournaments in ONE body of water, in ONE week - like there was during this example."
799771,frodobuggins,2013-07-23 22:34:00,127,If this were a scene in a movie right about now there would be silence and the camera would cut quickly to blank stares and blinking eyes and in the background a fading awkward cough.
799772,frodobuggins,2013-07-23 22:37:00,127,There really should be an official body that oversees tournament schedules throughout Ontario. And a special horsepower levy/tax on anyone using over a 9.9...

799821,Dave Bailey,2013-07-24 04:00:00,1641,"Frankly, it doesn't much matter if there are a few dead fish or a thousand, in the end the only figure that matters is the number of live fish out there. If there is no evidence that the population is declining, what's the problem? If there IS evidence that the population is declining, THEN it's a problem."

799836,Garnet,2013-07-24 10:56:00,2056,"And there wasn't 4 tournaments out of 4 locations.  You fish 1 tournament sat. and your points apply to 2 different divisions, and on Sunday you fish 1 tournament  and your pts apply to 2 different divisions.  So there was really 1 tournament sat. 60 boats 1 tournament Sunday 40 boats.  The cottagers running around on a nice weekend would double and triple the gas/oil consuming of this tournament.  For me tubing is a mindless pursuit, doesn't even look fun, cause all kinds of crazy waves bouncing boats around docks and just generally a waste of gas. PUT IT'S THEIR MONEY  And theirs likely to be 2-3 times as many rec fishermen on the Tri Lakes on any week end.  Tournaments are visible and these guys/girls can catch fish."
799840,grimsbylander,2013-07-24 12:35:00,3016, What does the number of tournaments have to do with anything?? We have club tournaments with 4 boats. The B1 will have more than 160 boats.   Zero knowledge = ridiculous statements
799841,outllaw,2013-07-24 12:44:00,1232,with folks wanting. tournament regulations-who pays. the mnr are overwhelmed-underfunded.. as for hp regs. seems a fruitless endeavour. mnr biologist survey species populations and sportsfishing quotas. screaming for permits/laws is a very slippery slope.. yes fish can die. heck people eat fish.
799853,jedimaster,2013-07-24 13:53:00,3472,"This whole argument about HP on a boat and everything is a bit crazy. I mean to be honest with you, you could fish a tournament essentially the same if everyone was limited to 4 strokes and 115's or less. It would mean getting to a spot at 40mph versus 60-80mph. What would that mean in the kawarthas? maybe 5 minutes of fishing time at most. Would that mean less pollution? I dunno, maybe a little. Would it make a difference in the grand scheme. Not likely as its been proven that the new line of 2 strokes don't pollute like they used to. So I think the environmental impact would be negligible at best.  What about safety? Well considering that most bass tourney anglers are very keenly aware of there surroundings and skilled at piloting there crafts. Certainly jet ski's and tubers and drunk joy riders present more of a danger. So there would be no real safety benefit to limiting the HP of a bass boat.  As for the fish, well it wouldn't really matter what boat people fished out of even to Frodo's point they would still catch the same number of fish so the number of mortalities wouldn't be any better. I would argue they would be worse as sometimes getting a fish in and out asap is easier with faster boats. So in my eyes mortality is lessened by better and faster boats.  And heck the taxes from gas alone from a good sized field of boats is upwards of 5k dollars into the federal and provincial coffer. So reducing the gas consumed reduces that revenue. Not to mention the money in the pocket to the local stations.  I have already stated that If all of a sudden catch and release tournaments were stopped  you would have 100 boats out there anyway catching and likely keeping fish. Tourney guys do not keep bass. Certainly not big bass. I can guarantee you I would have about five or more 6+ pounders on my wall if I wasn't a tourney angler. Instead I just have pictures. Catch and release programs owe a huge debt to bass tournaments. I can't possibly see how any angler would have anything bad to say about a tournament. If you are an avid fisherman and a catch and release fisherman then you owe debt to the tourney anglers that paved the way for catch and release fishing.  Also you probably don't know this but many Bass clubs and tournament anglers work hard every year on conservation projects. I urge you all to read more at http://ontariobass.com/conservation/ I am proud to be part of the Hawgtown Bass club and I know this club works very hard every year. I would like to show me any joint effort of people in 9.9hp tin boats what group efforts are made towards conservation. If you are a Bass angler or want to be I would suggest you consider looking up a local BASS chapter and consider joining a club as a boater or a non boater."
799858,jimmer,2013-07-24 14:32:00,2730,"Sorry, I can't agree with this statement jedimaster. Yes, most tournament anglers have driven these types of boats for years and have that knowledge and skill. But anyone can walk into a marina and walk out a bass boat owner, with no clue on driving those machines, join tournaments and call themselves pros. They're the scary ones. That's if they have the $$$$$ to do it. I have had plenty of near swamps from bass boats. Even experienced guys get a quick reminder at times, just ask JP Derose. Sorry, I know this post was about dead bass and I went off topic."
799864,nancur373,2013-07-24 15:17:00,1211,"My trailer park is on is on the east side of Pigeon Lake. We had the wind blowing everything to our shore all week last week. I saw a few dead carp and a lot of dead sunfish/bluegill. Not one bass. The water was stupid warm, of course there will be dead fish. This article sounds like the old man 'Get off my lawn' syndrome."
799867,lew,2013-07-24 15:24:00,12766,^^^^  I agree with everything jimmer said above.  Just because a guy has a 60 or 70 MPH bassboat doesn't make him a good boat driver anymore than having a 150 MPH Corvette make you safe on city streets.
799869,jedimaster,2013-07-24 15:31:00,3472,I did say MOST. not all. of course there are exceptions. Just like in anything. Fools will be fools of course.
799870,Steve,2013-07-24 15:31:00,2075,"Nor does having a sparkle boat make him a ""pro"".  I hate hearing that.  Promotional Staff - maybe.  Professional? - not likely."
799877,grimsbylander,2013-07-24 16:05:00,3016," What does ""call themselves pros"" have to do with anything??  This thread has hints of ""I don't want a bassboat so you shouldn't either"". Yes, anyone can buy a bassboat and drive like a maniac. Is that not true about most fuel powered vehicles? Sport bikes...cars.  The abundance of narrow minded stereotyping is surprising. If the act of operating or owning a bassboat were illegal, then the complaints would be valid. If this came to fruition the yacht, seadoo, cigarette and speed boat owner had better beware. Imagine heading to your fishing spot in your mandated 115hp four stroke while a parade of legal water vessels fly by. After all, they disqualified if caught operating their gas-powered engine without everyone wearing a life jacket, being tethered to a working kill switch, having a drop of alcohol on board, reported by ANYONE seeing them break a slow zone speed limit, or not having all mandated safety equipment on board.  Earlier this year I was approached on the water by the NY state police on a cold windy day. I was the only boat out along the particular stretch of water. They politely asked to see my son's and my fishing licences. They were very polite and friendly. I asked if they wanted to see safety equipment. Nope. I mentioned that it was the first time I had ever been approached and I'm out 30+ days a year on the river. He reply was ""It not you guys we worry about"". I've had them drive around me to stop two guys in a 14' aluminum. More than once!  So making negative blanket statements which target bassboats and their owners is no more intelligent than a thread suggesting a ban on 14' aluminum boats based on a few beer drinking, meat hunting, safety absent boaters."
799226,misfish,2013-07-20 22:26:00,29133,"The Shimano live release boat does just that.  I can recall,many times when an angler would come in and say ,hey,I need to get a fish to the boat. Guys would let him go by just for the sake of the fish.  Get off the tourney blaming flaming thing.

The only thing I consider rediculous is your comment.This  story reeks of NIMBY dribble plain and simple. EVEN IF some or all of the mortality was related to the event the other 30,000 tri lakes bass will insure the population recovers from the  loss of 10,20,30 fish if in fact it was even that many.

But that doesn't mean i can't fully appreciate or at least recognize that Bass Boats with 150 HP engines and the V8 trucks that tow them are not only overkill, but consume ungodly amounts of fuel for this Hobby.  P3TA? LOL.  You guys are worse than Americans and their guns. Oh no- somebody tried to tell me the 200 litres of fuel i burned thru today for a limit of 6 bass is not only NOT my God given right, but also NOT good for the environment.

799283,grimsbylander,2013-07-21 03:47:00,3016,Who knows for sure? Tournament anglers have to try extremely hard to make sure fish deaths are at an absolute minimum. A 57 boat tourney is 114 fisherman. I wonder what the mortality rate is for 114 recreational fisherman over two days?

799294,Sinker,2013-07-21 04:18:00,8692,The only FACT I've found here is that the locals who complained lived on the windblown shore. Any dead things would wash up there.  Its not like we're hurting for bass. They are a nuisance as far as I'm concerned.  S.

799303,frodobuggins,2013-07-21 10:52:00,127,"I agree. I used to fish in these tournaments in the late 80's when it was GM PRO BASS. Because of this experience, I know first hand how important it is to maintain a particular fish in a livewell and  a fishery as a whole. If i went off the rails it was to point out existentially, how insane, counter-productive bass fishing has become-if only for the energy consumed to participate in it. Since that time i have done most of my fishing from my canoe and its been great. Sure, fishability isnt as great or the kinds of techniques i would like to use arent possible, but i make do."
799308,DropShot'r,2013-07-21 12:37:00,62,"IMHO it does sound like those bass were well dead before the tourney.  I'm not a tourney angler, just a guy who likes to fish whenever I can.  Tournaments drive our industry, without them what little tackle industry there would be would still be in the stone ages. We'd all be using Mitchell 300 reels, mono line and yellow fiberglass Eagle Claw rods with carbide guides.  If you don't like tourneys go somewhere else to fish the weekend of an event. I know where they are each weekend and make plans accordingly.  Some of you crusty old dude's need to grow up and learn to accept that it's not always about you.  Steve"

Tourneys make ""OUR"" world go round. They are legal, well controlled, and tons of fun to watch on WFN. I would rather share the water wit an experienced Bass angler in a bass boat, than a weekend warrior towing speedo clad idiots in inner tubes or water skis all blinkin weekend.

799494,jedimaster,2013-07-22 17:17:00,3472,"I do fish tournaments and honestly the amount of gas burned is pretty high if you actually do the math. Typically we will burn a half tank or more of truck gas depending on where the tournament is located. So that's about 50 liters. I would say about 70 liters of boat gas is normal for a tournament day of fishing on a decent sized lake. So if everyone burns 120 liters in a day and there are 100 teams in a field that's 12,000 liters of gas burned.  It is a lot of gas plain and simple. However that gas would still be burned and those fish would still be caught if there were no tournaments. However consider this. If there were no tournaments Bass would go from game fish that are released more often than not to game fish that are eaten."

799530,grimsbylander,2013-07-22 19:56:00,3016,"I love fishing tournaments.  According to NASCAR, about 6,000 U.S. gallons (~22,700 litres) of fuel are consumed during a typical Sprint Cup weekend.[21] For the 2006 season, which included 36 points races, the total for the season would have been 216,000 U.S. gallons (818,000 litres). One environmental critic recently estimated NASCAR's total fuel consumption across all series at 2 million U.S. gallons (7.57 million liters) of gas for one season.[22]  But!!! No fish were killed!! I wonder if the dude on Chemong is a nascar fan?"

798968,esoxansteel,2013-07-19 14:51:00,1307,"From todays Peterborough Examiner, Dead Bass washed up on residents properties, and were found floating in lake this week, after a weekend tourney on the Tri-Lakes, a picture showed 5 very large and dead bass, on the front lawn of a Bridgenorth resident. Tourney president denies weekend event had anything to do with dead Bass, as the Shimano Live Release boat was used. MNR mentioned that extremely high water temps can cause undue stress on fish, and mortality can occur, but so far only Bass have been found or reported. Hopefully someone can post the link to see the story"
798970,lew,2013-07-19 14:56:00,12766, We fished Chemong on Wednesday and the water temps were 80F  We only fished a few hours then called it a day.
798972,Terry,2013-07-19 15:03:00,14456,"fish seems too rotten to be from the weekend but is a dozen dead fish from a tourney a big deal,  derbies and eaters kill a lot more then that     http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/2013/07/19/is-tourney-to-blame-for-dead-bass   Bridgenorth resident Bob Curry argues the dead bass that came ashore this week on his Chemong Lake property are a result of a bass tournament that was held on the lake on the weekend. The organization that runs the tournament said it has nothing to do with the dead fish and says its participants are careful to conserve fish populations. Galen Eagle/Peterborough Examiner/QMI Agency  Change text size for the story Print Report an error Bob Curry unwraps a black plastic garbage bag crawling with maggots and dumps out the remains of six decomposing bass on his Chemong Lake lawn. The odour is overwhelming. The 76-year-old Bridgenorth resident, who lives on Nicholls Blvd., is among a group of homeowners on the lake who discovered dead bass washing up on their shores on Monday and Tuesday. Curry said he’s confirmed about a dozen dead bass in total that washed up on properties on his side of the lake. The fish carcasses come just days after a catch and release bass tournament was held on the lake on the weekend. Curry and his neighbours argue the two events are connected and they worry the fish that have turned up could be just the tip of the iceberg. The organization that hosted the tournament said it had nothing to do with the dead fish. “It’s next to impossible,” replied Andrew Pallotta, president of the Competitive Sports Fishing League that hosted the 57-boat bass tournament Saturday and Sunday. The residents argue the tournament didn’t take into consideration the high temperatures over the weekend and the fish likely died when they were taken from the lake and placed into live wells en route to the weigh-in station. “How many … fish have they killed? These are breeder fish. The lake is in bad enough shape now,” Curry said. “I’m just positive that they didn’t account for the extreme heat in this catch and release program,” neighbour Greg Braund added. “I haven’t ever seen a kill-off like this before.” Rick Daniels, who runs a Chemong Lake fishing charter and writes a fishing column for The Examiner, said he too discovered about five dead bass earlier this week as did his immediate neighbours on lakeside Kelly Blvd. “I’m concerned that it was needless, something that could have been avoided,” he said. “These were all prime spawners. It was a shame. It was a needless kill as far as I’m concerned.” But Pallotta said there was no way the tournament was involved in the death of the fish. About a dozen fish died during the two-day event, but they were not dumped back into the lake, he said. Tournament anglers who bring in dead or dying fish are penalized. The tournament used the Shimano Live Release boat to store the captured fish, a technology that has been developed to ensure the fish go into the water in a better condition than when they leave it, he added. “I’ll argue anybody who wants to argue on the system because we have biologists, we have professors, we have universities behind our science,” he said. Pallotta said the criticism being levelled at the tournament has less to do with dead fish and more to do with residents who don’t want fishing tournaments on their lake in the first place. Curry, Braund and Daniels all shared long stemming issues with the six to eight fishing tournaments that bring hundreds of fishing boats to the lake each summer. They complain participants ignore parking rules in the lakefront neighbourhoods, block driveways with trailers, cast too close to docks and other boats and cause a nuisance to other area boaters. Curry argues the tournament anglers are just after big bucks and don’t care what impact they have on the fish or lake ecosystem. “These guys in the tournaments, they are in it for the money. They aren’t in it for the enjoyment and conservation,” he said. That can’t be further from the truth, Pallotta said. “If they weren’t there to take care of the fish, we wouldn’t have a fishery come three of four years,” he said. “These guys are top-end fisherman. These fish are our partners. It’s in in our best interest to take care of them.” Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) spokesman Jamie Prentice said the MNR has not received any complaints about dead bass on Chemong Lake. Prentice said fish can die naturally when temperatures skyrocket and warm the temperatures of the lake and reduce oxygen levels in the water. “More extreme weather conditions like this can lead to natural mortality,” he said. While he said it puts more stress on fish to be caught and released during hot temperatures, he said the Shimano Live Release boat is known to be effective. “Shimano … they are really good stewards of the resource that way,” Prentice said. The MNR does track complaints of fish die-off and will investigate if trends point to a source outside natural causes, he said.

798977,OhioFisherman,2013-07-19 15:46:00,6623,"I tend to think the number 1 cause of fish fatalities is people eating them, or perhaps other fish. Of course homes on a lake, boating, swimming has nothing to do with reduced water quality?"
798979,lew,2013-07-19 15:53:00,12766,"For what it's worth, when I was fishing Chemong the other day I saw LOTS of dead pan fish floating on the surface and I don't recall reading anything about a panfish tourney."
798983,OhioFisherman,2013-07-19 16:05:00,6623,"Heat and water temp reduces the amount of oxygen in the water, game fish tend to suffer before rough fish - panfish."
798999,esoxansteel,2013-07-19 18:15:00,1307," Exactly, with these water temps some mortality is to be expected, especially with gamefish which require more O2, went out on Rice Lake fishing walleyes at midnight wednesday, and the Indian River at Keene was 86.2 degrees on both my graphs, and Rice Lake was 81.4 to 82 degrees, again that was at midnight, hopefully the cold front will drop water temps, and also provide much needed relief and rain."
799008,lookinforwalleye,2013-07-19 19:00:00,4399,I can't see how having Bass in a livewell all day is good for them in this heat....but hey the show must go on!!!!!!
799023,musky_hunter,2013-07-19 19:53:00,328,make sure to have tons of ice and refresh water eveyr 30 mins.
799031,glen,2013-07-19 20:28:00,2641,No floating bass on any other lakes?   Chemong only die off? Tourney troubles.
799033,misfish,2013-07-19 20:32:00,29133,"Hot days always had ice on board. Learned that from the expereinced bass anglers. . When I had my own boat and fished tournys,I left the live well on all the time. Fresh water in all the time. I had one dead fish, it was due to a deep hook on a tube."
799039,Dave Bailey,2013-07-19 20:44:00,1641,"Every so often a fish is going to die in a tournament, but never enough to impact the fishery. And then the local snapping turtle gets a feed. The old circle of life thingy."
799041,Moosebunk,2013-07-19 20:50:00,3970,"For the sake of competition some lakes get beaten every single weekend despite any and every kind of weather.  What can ya do eh?   Leah asked me one time if I'd put one of my mud minnows in with her goldfish.  I said, ""sure, but watch what happens...""  From a cold water pail to a warm water tank the fish ripped around bashing it's head on the glass ti'll it turned belly up within about 30 seconds.  ""Dad, those minnows are crazy,"" she says. lol."
799064,lookinforwalleye,2013-07-19 21:59:00,4399,That's what I hated about Sugog almost every weekend there was a tourney and sometimes mid week as well.....always seemed to mess up the fishing for several days.
799067,musky_hunter,2013-07-19 22:05:00,328,weekend angler can do more damage than tourny guys. at least we release the fish instead of taking 6.
799077,lookinforwalleye,2013-07-19 22:27:00,4399,Not gunna get into a argument with a tournament angler can't really be bothered.....but this weekend angler takes zero fish home and puts zero fish in the livewell for a photo op.
799103,206,2013-07-20 00:14:00,563,"All tourny fish could be tagged before release, then you could confirm it was from tourny and who's livewell it was in. They could be held responsible...or you could do nothing and fish on!!"
799107,danc,2013-07-20 00:27:00,4677,"I wouldn't want to be on a tourny lake before, after, or any other time of the year. I'll take a solitudinal island or shoreline camping spot any trime. Peace and quit. Being one on one with nature. Don't forget the sugar for your coffee. Your nearest neighbor is 5 miles away. Yea. That's what I like about fishing. If I see a boat within a mile of me, it's time to move."
799108,misfish,2013-07-20 00:35:00,29133," Ya,and lets do this  to every other angler that catches and releases a fish. No where has it been confirmed, they were tourny fish.  "
799113,Terry,2013-07-20 00:49:00,14456,they have tagged all fish from some tourneys and they have found time and time again that the mortality rates were low every time
799121,porkpie,2013-07-20 01:55:00,2521,"While I agree tournaments are a bloody nuisance, and frankly if they did away with them, I would be a happy camper, I am of the opinion that die off occurs fairly often in extreme temps, and have seen it before.  While I'm sure it can't be good for the bass, I don't think it can be hung around the neck of the tournaments solely!"
799126,wkimwes,2013-07-20 02:12:00,76,"This sounds like more like people trying to find a way to stop tourneys on the lake altogether.  I'm sure it's ""annoying"", but the owners' of the properties don't own the ""lake"", which I'm sure these guys think they do.  Of course I'm probably a little bias as a guy who works for a company who has to deal with people like these guys.  It's a real nuisance, they make all kinds of claims without any ""scientific proof"", because frankly pnce the ministry lawyers show up they usually go away when they say...when you pay for a biological, ecological and environmental impact study then you have no proof or evidence and you will get squashed by a mediator when we will have already paid for those assessments and approved by the ministry."
799153,Rich,2013-07-20 10:59:00,3927,Most fish were so unbothered by the tournament experience they actually returned to the exact place they were caught.
799166,frodobuggins,2013-07-20 13:37:00,127,I think this is more the opinion of people who fish tournaments so they don't feel bad about doing something they enjoy and not something based on study or fact.   Wilde (2003) reviewed 12 scientific studies that examined dispersal of tournament caught black bass and reported that 14% of largemouth bass and 32% of smallmouth bass returned to their site of capture.
799223,Dutch,2013-07-20 22:07:00,831,It is unfortuante that those fish died whether it was the fault of the tournament(s) or not.  The article was jaded against the tournament fisherman from the start.  There were other comments in the article about trailers blocking driveways and littering the streets.  Simple bias ad NIBMY comments from a person with an obvious bias towards bass fishing and tournaments being run on the tri-lakes.  It is unfortunate that every dead bass that winds up on shore after a tournament is owned by the tournament.
