So I was out fishing with my buddy and we always play the game "" guess the weight"" I took a picture of one bass with my phone and sent it to a friend with a little less experience than us asking him how much do you think this fish weighs ? he replied 5 1/2 pounds plus. the fish didn't even weigh 2 1/2 lbs. Now any decent fish that may be personal bests have pictures taken with the fish on the scale ( making sure the tail can be seen without any hands pulling it down lol) a measurement pic and then a quick one with me. My theory is a picture doesn't lie. So all my buddies know that if they want me to believe the weight of a fish they better have a pic with it on a scale needless to say all of us now have the same digital scale."

We used a scale for a short period of time last summer with bass to make sure we weren't miss quoting fish.  Fortunately a PB smallie was caught in that short window that we can peg a weight.  Other then that we stick to a picture and if asked a rough educated estimate that is usually slightly under what we think.  Other species we aren't as familiar with get measured in length - pike, walleye, muskie - the scale rarely comes out.  A fish story is always a fish story without a video or photo...

Buddy was a member at a club and always bragged about how good he was and invited me out one day. Turned out this doofus was even worse than me and probably whacked the ball 10 times on every hole but put himself down for 3 or 4. I didn't care until we got back to the club house where he started yapping to his friends about his great game and how he beat me by 30 odd stokes.  I told him on the way home that he was an idiot and we'd played our last game together and don't think I ever  talked to him again.  He fell down the basement stairs awhile later and was killed.  Everyone including me suspected his wife pushed him and I said perhaps he'd taken her golfing too and bragged to his buds about how much he beat her by...

He had a beautiful 21' bass boat and a 300 hp on the back ... but it was always docked.  Our last evening his nice looking wife called us over to join them for ""fish and beer"".  How can one say no to that?  Well, once on shore I asked whose beautiful boat it was - trying to get some local bass info.  Instead I was told by the owner that he was a ""pike tournament fisherman""....didn't know there was such a thing.  He then followed by telling me of the 14lbs bass his dad caught, and the 10lbs bass he caught....but those were only the small ones.

799743,jimmer,2013-07-23 19:48:00,2730,"I get a chuckle out of fishing stories. Many a books written about them. You can always suggest that they enter a tournament if they can boat fish like that, since it's rare to see a bass over 7 lbs weighed in. I used to be a full time taxidermist and would get calls from customers ranting about their 10 pound walleye or 7 pound bass, so when they showed up it was only proper to charge them what a 10 pound walleye would cost, then they would argue the fish is only 22 inches. So, I would ask which way they would prefer the mount, as an 10 pounder or the 3-4 pounder that it realy is. Kind of hard to stretch the skin that much and satisfy them when they picked the fish up. Must be like a drug once you touch a fish, you start imagining things. LOL However, I have a friend who always under estimates the size of a fish. He is always surprised when we weigh in our bag of fish."

I'm out fishing and truthfully feel trusting enough of a fellow angler sharing the water to tell him of a big fish I caught there, with a truthful weight of 4.5 or 5 pounds.. and they fire back with ""oh yeah?! I got an 8 pounder here last May"" or most recently ""i got a 10 pounder on that tiny 1ft deep pond"". Then they pull out the pics. From that point on I have to decide how to handle this elegantly. I can't let it slip as the bass in the picture looks 3.5 giving about a pound benefit of the doubt for bad photography. Do I yell ""LIAR"" in his face, and smash him with a paddle? Hmm maybe too violent. Do I make a clever joke, like ""last time I got one that big it was 2 pounds!"" , or do I make an innocent comment like ""was that on a scale?"" Or ""how old is your scale?"" ...  I just don't get it. I hear it all the time from lots of people. Why? Like, just.. why do it?!  By the way, I am in NO WAY accusing anyone here of doing this!"

Doesn't bother me and I actually think those people telling the stories really think they are that big, but people that catch a lot of bass know better.  Many of the story tellers spend their lives catching 1.5 to 2 pound bass, so a 3 or 4 looks huge to them and they share their catches.  It happens with all stripes of anglers.  It is as common as all the stories at the weigh-in of tournaments of losing 4's and 5's that would have been the kicker in their 10 pound sack."

In golf it's always a reduction as in score, in fishing it's the weight X 1.858. Or as I said increase the weight until yours is biggest."

Guy of course says, ""nice fish""  BUT,  one time when I was at Kesagami, while fishing off the dock at the lodge I caught a 72 incher that took about an hour to reel in.  It was so big we needed two guys to roll it up onto the dock where I then shot it dead in the head.  I replied, ""Ohhhh, so you caught a fish probably two to three times heavier than the world record and there at the Lodge in front of a group of paying customers from all over the place, quickly materialized a gun and put a hole through the fish and probably the Lodge's floating dock.  You're an idiot and a liar who must actually think I'm an idiot.

Most of my rods have Rod Rule decals on them for this purpose.  It never fails that people ask me how much my fish weigh, and I answer them in inches, usually to a puzzled look. Truth is, they're probably not more than a couple pounds usually, if that, and it doesn't really matter to me. I know people who catch a little 1-2lb bass and they're so excited, they put it on their 50lb scale because they are excited about it and think it's gotta be huge. I dunno, I used to be like that. I can understand the mentality.  Funny thing is, I had a guy embelish FOR ME once.. That was odd. I told him about some decent trout I caught at this one lake we both fish. Ran into him and his friend a few weeks later, and he starts telling the guy, ""this is Dana, he's caught a six-pound speck up at Blank Lake!"" And I'm like, uh... no? I wish. Haha."

He puts one customer's six pound bass on his government-certified scale and its actually 3.2 pounds .... a 20 pound steelhead is really 11 pounds ... another guy's 30 pound muskie actually weighs 17. He says the vast majority of fish brought into his shop are over-estimated by 50 percent.  From what I've seen on the water, it's probably higher than that.

You know that point over there by the over flow? Well, there is an old steamer by the name of MT Juliette, that sank from back in the logging days. It laid to rest in in 147 ft of water. it is one of my favorite places to jig for BIG Lakers on Nip. Well, wouldn't you know it, I hooked into something and brought it up. I knew I was on top of the ship cause what I brought up was a lantern. The name was boldly engraved MT Juliette in the solid brass base plate. The best part of the whole episode was that the wick was still lit!""  The guy replied to me...""Oh come on man, you expect me to believe that??? How the heck would the lantern still be lit after coming up from the bottom?""  I simply replied...""Tell ya what, I'll blow out the wick on the lantern if you want to knock 6 lbs off your Brookie"".  He looked at me and with a flush face, he simply walked away."
