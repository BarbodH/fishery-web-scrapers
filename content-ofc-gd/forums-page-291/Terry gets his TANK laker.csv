800359,misfish,2013-07-27 17:22:00,29133,"It was one of those days. Big fish eight off the bat and nothing else to show,but what a great fish. This fish was fat. 15+ easy.  Ride out was nice.    Get there and the graph is loaded.    10 minutes in and Terrys rod pops,and dives down. It was one of those what the hell,Im getting spooled. Then he got the fish under control sorta,before another bolt to the bottom.    Getting closer    Get it in the net and pop out comes the lure. Whew.   Nice fish buddy. Pic does not do this fish justice..  "
