800179,Canuck2fan,2013-07-26 02:48:00,1444,Not sure about Turkey Point but the fish were scattered for the boats on Monday in the eastern basin. We talked to two or three boats who came in when a non storm threatened and we were out fishing them from the pier. The perch move around a bit and so the best advice is usually just to leave port and look for the armada. Even on Monday with few fish being caught there were still 25 boats grouped together out of Port Bruce. If you see 75 to 100 boats you are probably not going to have enough minnows LOL.
