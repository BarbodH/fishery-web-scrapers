98603,Marko,2007-07-27 23:33:00,854,Gone fishing with a friend of mine  and hooked into some fish. Plan was to go after smallmouths but after i saw these guys swim around i couldnt really resist. The thrill was catching them in the pools where they were just relaxing and looking for something to eat. Ended up going 4/6 with one breaking my 6 pound line off. All of them were caught on corn.  Here are some pics.   
98622,fatherof3,2007-07-28 01:21:00,1769,not too bad a day of fishing. good job
98634,Victor,2007-07-28 02:02:00,1609,those are some lean machines!  must have been fun to catch them with 6lb line in such clear water
98689,Photoz,2007-07-28 14:04:00,792,"Yup . . . .   it IS a real test of skill bringing in a good sized carp on light gear!! With the water being so clear, the 6 pound line sure helps. Good healthy lookin' fish . . . .   .     Grand River?"
98707,Marko,2007-07-28 16:52:00,854,All fish were caught at St marys Not quite sure what river flows right through it.
98742,dsn,2007-07-28 19:55:00,1018,Nice fish. Looks like a great palce to hunt down carp. I love clear water carping. Its a blast to see your yellow corn disappear.  dsn
98802,Marko,2007-07-29 03:11:00,854,One fish came up and just chilled maybe 3 feet away from me and i swear to god it was looking at me. Then it found my corn and just nudged it and swam away. It teased me LOL  I wanted to go back there today but made a mistake and ended up going to Conestogo Lake. I didn`t realize that everything around that lake is a private property and had to settle for fishing bellow the dam. Didnt catch anything tho
98830,dsn,2007-07-29 11:52:00,1018, Sounded like you got the chills when it was looking right a you.  dsn
98833,Photoz,2007-07-29 12:50:00,792,"Likely one o' them thar killer Asian carp, sizin' you up . . . . .    gettin' ready to jump up and lay his tail alongside your head . . . . .     lucky to escape with your life! Is that stretch of water anywhere near Sarnia . . . .    heh . . .     heh?"
98901,Marko,2007-07-29 19:45:00,854,"Naww nowhere near Sarnia haha I`ve seen those crazy fish jump around on some Youtube videos. Also i saw rednecks catching them with bows and arrows. I wonder how many get injured every year, shoothing like that."
98927,Carpe Diem,2007-07-29 22:42:00,61,"Not sure but that could be the Thames River. St. Mary's is close to London, on the way to Stratford if i remember correctly. Nice fish Marko."
