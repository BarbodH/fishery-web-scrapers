98709,bassmaster4,2007-07-28 16:56:00,801,In a week i am going up to Lake Minisinakwa in the Gogama area near Timmins. This lake has pike bass walleye burbot or ling or whatever its called and whitefish. I have caught whitefish but it was accidental and dont quite know the water depth or anything so i am wondering if anyone could give me tips on how to catch whitefish and ling i will be fishing from a boat and on shore. Whitefish to me sort of look like carp because the mouth is like a carp's mouth would be so i was thinking bottom fishing. Thanks in advance.  Bassmaster4
98728,bbog,2007-07-28 18:30:00,665,bassmaster4 my experience with Whitefish is jigging with small Williams Wablers (Gold and Silver nu-wrinkle finish) at Whitefish Shoal in Simcoe. I have heard from some that it is popular use a Rapala Jigging Shad Rap while anchored over known Whitefish locations. Can't vouch for this as I have not tried it myself.  Good luck.

99251,fishboy,2007-07-30 19:56:00,550, the jigging rap definately works on Simcoe whities
