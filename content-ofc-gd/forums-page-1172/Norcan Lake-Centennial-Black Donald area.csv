Last year we made several trips together, but due to our different work schedules it hasn't worked out this year.  I have never been there...so I looking for some information. We plan on camping somewhere on the lake (crown land). Have anyone ever been there....or camped on the lake?  How is the boat launch and where?  Any pointers or general locations as to where to catch some bass?  Any help would be greatly appreciated....I'm a little nervous about driving 4 hours to only find out that I am unable to launch my boat with my mini-van and no where to set up camp for 5 days!!!  PM me if you'd feel more comfortable....thanks  Jason"
