99014,Nanook,2007-07-30 03:52:00,565," When posted about having your job stolen, I said then, that that you cant keep a good  man down!  You have proved it once again Cliff. Congratulations to ya, and all the best for the future. I'm sure, between us we could keep you working 'til your 80!"
99066,doubleheader,2007-07-30 12:47:00,497,"Cliff, we have never corresponded and you surely don't know me but thanks for sharing your story. I went thru a similiar change of life 6 years ago. It has a way of putting life into perspective.  Glad to here that you are doing well."
99112,Shelley Cooper,2007-07-30 14:29:00,394,Wow.. thats a great report Cliff....  Glad to hear everything is turning out great for you....  thanks for sharing
98715,oldschool,2007-07-28 17:14:00,38,"Big Cliff,  Certainly we have never met, but I have read many posts of yours and I have come to respect you and your ethics and take on life.  I am certainly happy for you and the decisions that have led to a better place for your life.  I am writing to offer some encouragement for the next couple years in school in that I too have had a similar experience.  At 52 I decided to chuck it all and go to college.  After nearly 4 years I have graduated with a BSBA a couple of months ago.  Now when I complete a job application or other correspondence and check the area that says ""Indicate Level of Education"", and I can enter Bachelor's degree, I mentally strut around like a school kid with a new pair of shoes.  Good luck, I know that you will continue showing the rest of us the best way to approach life.  Roy"
98716,Smokey,2007-07-28 17:19:00,1278,Thats great news Cliff. I remember in the spring when you lost the job and finding something to keep you busy that you enjoy is a bonus. Glad to hear your having fun.  Mike
98720,Garyv,2007-07-28 17:31:00,547,"Cliff...I think some of the most fun I have had working has been since our so called retirement 7 years ago.  Besides the stuff I do out of the house, my starting to work at the campground 3 years ago has been a blast.  Between the office on weekends during the summer to cutting grass, plowing snow, operating our grounds equipt and doing light maintaince after summer is over I just have a a great time.  I think things are just more fun when you don't have to do it but just work because you want to!"
98785,Daplumma,2007-07-28 23:59:00,1961,"Good stuff Cliff,couldn't happen to a nicer guy.I would like to welcome you to the world of service work.Plumbing,HVAC,Mechanic and Farrier.Its all the same thing,know your trade and make the customer think that you are their ""go to guy"".You will do well and have a blast with it,dont know if Art or I will ever ""retire""its too much fun to go to work each day.Best of luck and glad you landed on your feet(not that there was any chance of any other outcome). Joe"

98811,cisco,2007-07-29 04:41:00,597,Great news Cliff!  Prouda you bud!
98814,Hooked,2007-07-29 05:01:00,891,"Good stuff on the new inspiration.  I was also glad to hear, in an evil way, that your former employer is having tough times with your former division."
98825,Big Cliff,2007-07-29 11:36:00,6899,Good morning all!  Thanks for all the replies! It is nice to have the support when things are rough but it sure is fun to share the good times!  The website I went to was http://careercruising.com but you need a username and password. I just tried the old ones I used but they didn't work. I'll try to get current ones in the next few days for those of you that want them.
98835,aplumma,2007-07-29 13:09:00,6896,Yea that karma she is a good old girl. She makes sure all of the good/bad are rewarded. Working with your hands is one of the most satisfying things you can do in life. To be able to take something broken and make it work again feels really good. The interaction with the people when you can return a unit to them working again for alot less than a new one is a win win situation. With this career you should be able to work on products till you are old and grey and then have a few employee's trained up to the point were you get to just smile and greet all of the customers when you just dont quite want to get so dirty that day. I am glad that you are felling happy about were you are right now.   Art
98844,solopaddler,2007-07-29 14:09:00,8605,"Congratulations Cliff, sounds like things are working out well!"
98952,Gerritt,2007-07-30 00:14:00,6129,"Cliff, you and I have shaken hands on more then one occasion. I have to say that your new outlook is very promising indeed! I wish you all the best... Infact I know you will do well...  who could not like a person with a heart as big as yours is.. I am very happy I clicked on this post... you made my night!! Thank you!   I wish you all the best!  Gerritt."
