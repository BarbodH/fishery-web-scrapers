99413,silvio,2007-07-31 04:56:00,433,Going to be up at wasaga beach this weekend and never really targeted pike. I have caught 1 at 22 inches before. Was wondering if there are any spots that have pike near wasaga willing to drive 45 minutes any direction. Donâ€™t need gps points just the lake/river name I will try my best to find them.
99416,jediangler,2007-07-31 05:02:00,1923,It's a lot closer to Port Elgin but Arran lake has pike in it as well as smallmouth like this one the Shipper caught last year. 
99417,silvio,2007-07-31 05:10:00,433,Thanks for your help jediangler but it's about a 2 hour drive probably to far.
99571,dheitzner,2007-07-31 19:10:00,314,"hey silvio, do some research on the minesing swamp area, SE of wasaga.  I have seen a couple of pike(including an 8lb'r caught on a mepps) come out of that area while salmon fishing in the fall.  if you want to know a good access area, shoot me a PM. good luck, darcy"
