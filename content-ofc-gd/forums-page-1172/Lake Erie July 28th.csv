My dad and my nephew Isaiah had a great day out there. Silver bass were unlimited, we kept about 40 and started releasing the rest. Smallies were biting too. It was Isaiah's greatest day of fishing yet, he had a blast and so did I. Jigging spoons, grubs and yes the old faithful worm for Isaiah were the hot baits.  Don't get too many awesome days like that on the big lake!      "
