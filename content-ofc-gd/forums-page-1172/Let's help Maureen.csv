99409,kennyman,2007-07-31 04:16:00,737,I bet I did at least 500. I did it until she moved to 14th and still did a bunch more.. C'mon guys!
99410,fatherof3,2007-07-31 04:39:00,1769,just did another half hour but still in 14th
98504,RobHall,2007-07-27 18:26:00,261," huh? I don't think i said Moe was not deserving.  In fact I hope she makes it to the top 4 as well.  I guess you misunderstood my post.  I wasnt taking anything personally.      I was merely making an observation that Moe has been moving up fast and that i don't think there is enough time for folks who are voting, to put her into the top 4 and thus gaurantee her a secondary prize.  This is just my opinion of course.  I really hope i'm proven wrong and will be the first in line to congratulate her in winning the secondary prize or even the grand prize if she is fortunate enough to be picked by WFN.  Cheers.  FOTB "
98508,RobHall,2007-07-27 18:37:00,261," I agree Beans.  If you can't beat'em....then join'em.  If we get a few more folks disabling their internet cookies, it might just be enough to put Moe into the top 4.  I hope she makes it.  Cheers.  FOTB "
98510,Joey,2007-07-27 18:37:00,9122,"Well that's great FOTB, I too hope you make it to the top 4 as well  Joey"
98511,Roy,2007-07-27 18:38:00,13728,Don't be the first in line to congratulate her. Be the first in line to vote for her.
98514,RobHall,2007-07-27 18:42:00,261, I have done that as well.  In fact there was one day last week where i disabled my internet cookies and spent 40 minutes voting for Moe.  I probably managed about 800 to 1000 votes in that timespan.  Cheers.  FOTB 
98516,RobHall,2007-07-27 18:47:00,261," I was once in 2nd place at the beginning of July.  However once i realized that folks could disable their internet cookies and vote as fast as they could click a mouse, I gave up.  I've since slipped to 12th place. and will most likely slip even further by the time the end of the month rolls around.  The only prize i care about is the Grand Prize and the online voting has no bearing on that prize.  Cheers  FOTB "
98524,valerie,2007-07-27 18:57:00,83,How do i vote?
98525,RobHall,2007-07-27 19:00:00,261, Go here and vote for Maureen Manning.  She is currently 15th.  Cheers  FOTB 
98533,valerie,2007-07-27 19:24:00,83,So i guess i just click on her photo. thanks
98534,RobHall,2007-07-27 19:26:00,261," You may be prompted to install a flash plugin.  Once that is done, you click on her photo and it will come up in in the left hand window.  Click the ""vote"" button.  Cheers  FOTB "
98537,Bernie,2007-07-27 19:36:00,3190,Just discovered that I can vote once from Firefox and once from IE without disabling cookies.
98630,Loonietoon,2007-07-28 01:48:00,1450,
98670,Big Cliff,2007-07-28 10:41:00,6899,"Well, I keep voting but only once a day. I wasn't smart enough to figure out the thing about the cookies."
98691,fatherof3,2007-07-28 14:29:00,1769,just voted again and she has dropped a spot
98828,Big Cliff,2007-07-29 11:45:00,6899,# 14 as of this morning! It's heading in the right direction.
98831,Roy,2007-07-29 12:01:00,13728,"OK friends, we only have two days to get it together. If anyone on the board deserves a shot at the boat, it's Maureen. Let's give it to her.... let's vote Florida style :-)"
98834,Cookslav,2007-07-29 12:51:00,1457,How does one vote more then once per day?
98862,fatherof3,2007-07-29 15:55:00,1769,"did my part,still number 14"
98867,RobHall,2007-07-29 16:15:00,261," Hi Roy,  I guess you didnt read my previous posts.  Let me restate it again....How many votes Maureen gets, does not have any bearing on whether or not she wins the boat.  The winner of the boat is choosen by the staff at WFN.  So you saying ""Let's give it to her....let's vote Florida style""....is communicating the wrong message.  It should read....If anyone on the board deserves a shot at the $350 WFN secondary prize package, it's Maureen. Let's give it to her.... let's vote Florida style.  This community has no control over who wins the grand prize boat.  Cheers  FOTB "
98869,RobHall,2007-07-29 16:24:00,261,"For those that really want Maureen to win the $350 secondary prize package, you need to disable your acceptance of internet cookies.  by disabling your acceptance of internet cookies, you can vote more the once in a 24 hour period.  In fact you can vote as often as you can point and click a mouse.  In internet explorer, this is how you do it.  1. Click ""Tools"" 2. Click ""Internet Options"" 3. Click the ""Privacy"" Tab 4. Move the sliding bar up all the way until it says ""block all cookies""  Then go the the wfn voting site and go nuts.  Vote for Maureen as much as your heart desires.  I have already done this a few times to the tune of some 3000 votes.  If all the folks who are casting votes for Maureen did this, she would be able to crack the top 4 and win the secondary prize.  Cheers,  FOTB "
98873,Joey,2007-07-29 16:53:00,9122,I've been doing it for days FOTB.  Got her down from 34 to 21 one day.  Almost got her on the first page yesterday.  If its slow at work tomorrow I'll try to get her to top 4  Joey
98876,RobHall,2007-07-29 17:02:00,261," Excellent!!      Have you figured out how many votes you have cast so far.  How many hours did it take you to get her from 34 to 21?.  She is about to overtake me for 13th place.     j/k.  I will vote for a hour or so later today and see of it moves her up any further.  It will be quite an accomplishment if we as a community, can get her into the top 4.  Cheers.  FOTB "
98899,Joey,2007-07-29 19:34:00,9122,"No, I didn't count the times I had to vote to advance a spot.  I think it depends on how many more votes the next person in line has.  Some spots seem to take longer than others to pass.  It only took me about a 1/2 hour for the 34 to 21 spot.  I was on the phone at work and just kept clicking back and forth     I was talking business of course  Joey"
98908,Cookslav,2007-07-29 20:36:00,1457,"I was curious to try this ""lost cookie"" theory and wouldn't you know it... I just dropped about 100 votes in there LOL.... 1 vote/3 seconds=  5 minutes of spare time put to good use"
99380,Loonietoon,2007-07-31 01:39:00,1450,Come on people Mo's slipping to 14th position... Lets get voting
96212,John,2007-07-20 12:19:00,2956,Hot dang..............27th this morning. Keep up the good work guys and gals. Vote on every computer you can find....
96233,dustink,2007-07-20 12:58:00,526,Thanks for the heads up FOTB....  Now 2 people to vote for everyday....  Good luck to you both!!
96246,Shaun Rickard,2007-07-20 13:27:00,144,"Done, good luck Maureen  Cheers, Shaun"
96249,Joey,2007-07-20 13:30:00,9122," Paul, read FOTB's post, that'll answer your question.  Joey"
96268,BITEME,2007-07-20 14:50:00,1969,ok mo you got my vote ill keep adding just say a few words of luck for me in the salmon derby
96271,John,2007-07-20 14:56:00,2956,"Just read it Joey, that kinda changes the complexion a little..........If WFN picks the grand prize winner then it's kinda academic."
96578,Whopper,2007-07-21 14:40:00,2174,ttt
96590,Beans,2007-07-21 16:09:00,3339,I went on the WFN site and informed them that by clearing your cache...you can vote as many times a day as you like and have time for...  I also suggested that all the entrants names be put in a hat and the first 4 names drawn win the $250 BPS gift cerificates plus the extras...seems like the only fair way to run it now that the voting can be rigged...  SHADES of voting in Florida !!!  Maybe if they receive more e-mails from OFC members this will happen...
96620,Clampet,2007-07-21 19:44:00,1947,Got another in!
96935,kennyman,2007-07-23 04:04:00,737,"Keep voting guys. There are enough of us here to push her over the top. C'mon, help out an OFC'r. We'd do it for you too."
97366,Loonietoon,2007-07-24 01:25:00,1450,
97439,RobHall,2007-07-24 04:08:00,261,"     I guess none of you read my previous post in this thread.  I know you are all trying to help Moe climb the ranks in this ""Adopt and Angler"" online voting contest, but your efforts are rather fruitless.  That is unless each and every one of you voting for Moe, decides to disable their acceptance of ""interent cookies"" and vote at least a few thousand times a day.  Then Moe may make some progress and move up a few notches in the online voting.  In my opinion....it just isnt worth it to sit in front of your PC and click on the ""Vote"" button time after time after time.  I calculated that one vote takes about 2 seconds.  That works out to 30 votes a minute and 1800 votes an hour.  If you do this for a few hours (3) each day for the entire duration of the contest, you would have approx 250,000 votes.  Is this all worth a $350.00 BPS/WFN prize package?  That is what the top 4 online vote getters win.  To some entrants obviously, but to me it just is not worth the effort it would take to win one of the 4 secondary prizes.   The Grand Prize Boat/$2000 BPS shopping spree is awarded by WFN....they are the ones who pick the one winner out of all the 400 entries.  Cheers,  FOTB "
97711,Loonietoon,2007-07-25 00:45:00,1450,Come on people... Moe's dropped to 33rd place... lets get some votes in

98479,RobHall,2007-07-27 17:32:00,261,Moe went from 21st to 17th place overnight.      Someone must have alot of time on their hands and is voting as fast as they can point and click a mouse.      GL in your quest to put Moe into the top 4 and thus gaurantee her one of the 4x secondary prizes.  I'm not sure it can be done in 4 days though.  Cheers  FOTB 
98495,Joey,2007-07-27 18:05:00,9122,"  Don't take it so personally FOTB.  I hope she does get to the top 4.  She's very deserving of it and has always given of herself when she can.  C'mon people, lets keep voting.  Joey"

95840,RobHall,2007-07-19 17:16:00,261," I have also entered the Adopt an Angler contest and currently sit in 10th place.  I wish Motv8tr all the best in winning the Bass boat, $2000 BPS shopping spree and WFN fishing lessons.  At one point I was in 2nd place, but have quickly dropped out of the top 4.  Just an FYI.  The top 4 online vote getters win the 4 secondary prizes.  The Grand prize winner is chosen by the folks at WFN.  GRAND PRIZE INCLUDES: Brand new 2007 Panfish 17 Tracker Boat with Trailer (retail $15,000 Cdn.) $2,000 Shopping spree to Bass Pro Shops Canada Lessons from WFN Pro Angler  Four (4) secondary prizes will be awarded to the top 4 online entries as voted by you! Secondary prizes include: $250 Gift card to Bass Pro Shops and a WFN prize package.  Please Note:  Several folks who have entered this contest, have discovered a way around the 1 vote/24 hour period limitation.  If you disable the ""acceptance of cookies"" from within your browser settings, you can vote as many times as you like.  In fact you can sit in front of you PC and keep voting for yourself for hours on end if you want the secondary prize bad enough.  The botton line is....the 4x secondary prizes will be awarded to the Adopt an Angler entrants who have the most time on their hands.  It's amazing what folks will do for a $350 prize package.

94593,Deg,2007-07-16 17:47:00,51,Congrats Maureen ... you are moving up.  I've been voting everday and Mo was at 138 when I started. I emailed some friends (who don't know her) and explained the situation.  Yesterday one of them called me to say that all 9 computers in their office are voting at noon.  Looks like it is helping.  She is now up tp 35th.  I wander how many total votes each person has?
