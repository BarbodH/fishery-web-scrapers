Conditions were hot and clear and he hit a bouchertail inline spinner tipped with a white kalins mogambo grub. Probably the smallest of the musky I've caught so far this year but had some nice colours and fought well. Easy release too as I had a bud along for once to give me a hand and snap a decent pic. We were hoping to get him his first but no luck, I think he's probably hooked now anyways.      I love those grubs. Found a place today where I can get them for 69 cents apiece. Sweet! The one I've been using is getting pretty torn up!"

99052,ccmtcanada,2007-07-30 12:12:00,7971,"Nice catch!!! I've yet to find a good shore spot for Muskie that's close to home.  Nice colours on that guy...you say he's little, I say it's a nice fish!"
99067,Rich,2007-07-30 12:48:00,3927,Nice ski. Funny when I lived up there I rarely fished that shoreline. Guess I should have!
