After my disaster of a fishing trip to Bisco (only approx 10 eyes and 15 pike in 6 days ) and to Nipigon (tornados, floods and a medivac ). I have managed to follow it up with 3 skunks in a row on Simcoe for smallies and a complete skunk out of Port Maitland today. I have either completly lost my Mojo or am having to pay for my great season last year. How can you manage NOT to catch a smallie on Simcoe when you are fishing a football field sized reef that tops out in 10 feet of water in 2 sunrises and one sunset? Have any memebers of the board managed to hide a banana on my boat or something???? Any suggestions on how I can get my Mojo back...oh... and has anyone seen it?   D"
98942,danc,2007-07-29 23:44:00,4677,Go back to Nipigon in the fall. Even the locals that are a half hour away don't fish there when you did. Can't help you with Simcoe...
