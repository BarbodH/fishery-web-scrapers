I had another great adventure with lots of fish caught and a great visit with friends I only get to spend time with once a year cause of distance we live apart now. We hit great weather for the week and fishing was consistent every day.  I'll let the pics tell the rest of the story.  Home for 5 days, not too rough eh!   The view from camp   Me with some fish fry keepers   Some visitors    sunset from the camp   Time to go home   The gang "
