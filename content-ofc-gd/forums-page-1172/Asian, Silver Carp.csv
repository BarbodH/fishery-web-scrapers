So listen up all herbal remedies and health food stores!! Go get as many asian carp and gather in all the omega 3's!!!  Here's where I got the article!! Surely they will harvest them to death you watch and see!!  They'll be wipped as soon as they stick their ugly heads out of the water!!  filleting carp and eating carp  dsn
99021,ehg,2007-07-30 04:13:00,2666,"Well that is an interesting viewpoint on those bighead/silver carp invaders. The silver carp are said to be the best eating and i have read they are highly rated for sushi etc,...  The article does mention that the common carp around here is not even close to being that good.  But i would never eat them and wouldn't want them invading our waters.  cheers,  ehg"
