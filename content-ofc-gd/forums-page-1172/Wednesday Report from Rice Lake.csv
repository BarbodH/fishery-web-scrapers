As mentioned before, if you are looking for an alternative activity for entertaining your clients, or if you want a good lesson on fishing, don't hesitate to contact Greg. I'll probably be booking him again in September or October.  The highlites of the day, aside from Greg's constant hauling in of fish, were a 4+ LMB caught by my customer, and an incidental walleye that I caught mid day. Pictures attached.  "
