99082,bigcreekdad,2007-07-30 13:18:00,546,"Just returned from a week at Crane's Lochaven Lodge on the French. Temps in mid 80's all week, and way too much sun for my liking. Fishing from Saturday thru Wednesay was pretty much limited to bass dragging worms, although we cauht many. Casting for pike or muskie was frutless. Then, on Thursday, fishing got hot. That day,  the weather was pretty much the same temp wise, but abit more breeze and intermittant cloud cover. Result was around a dozen pike, 4 smallies ( biggest 20"") and 2 muskie....one 30"" and one fat 44"". All fish hit a black Buchertail with a stinger hook and orange twister on the stinger. The larger lunge was a hoot to land. He went immediately in the thick cabbage and then jumped 15' and a rght angle from where my line wentin th water. Thus, I had no leverageon hm until I could get the weeds off. THat took sevedral minutes and several tries as he made several runs, all under boat of course. Eventually he found his way around my trolling motor, which required the old pass thru to correct. If I had my trusty old Evinrude troller, I would have lifted it easily when I first hooked the fish, but I've got a gd Minnkota Power Drive hich is apain in the butt to raise and canot be done with one hand ( nice design!). In any case, we finally lande the brute and a French couple fishing nearby who had come over to watch took a few photos of fish, myself, and my son. Fish was pretty tuckered and took a few minutes to revive, but swam off.  Our last day, Friday, myself and a buddy took a guide and our three kids( in total) out on a pontoon boat for the day. As such, there was no seriousmuskie fishing but we all caught fish, and had a damn good shore lunch. Best part ofthe day was fishing the rapids below the Chaudiere dam, where the kids caught mant smallies on worms, and I caught 4 fish from 15-19"" on tubes. Good day, and good trip overall. Could have done ith a it less sun, but you take what you can get.  THe sour ending was arriving home to our cabin in northern Michigan and discovering that our cooler is gone from the boat. Must have flown out somehow, as my son never left the car the only 2 times stopped on the way. Always carry cooler in boat ( probably 30 trips at least).....never will again. In any case, the collere held our rain gear, boots, flashlights, assorted gear, and, most importantly.........my camera! Why I put it in there is beyond me. The cameracan be replace......the pics/memories....never. I'm hoping to cotactthe French couplevia email to see if they took a pic of the muskie themselve, and if so, I'll post it here. Otherwise, I'm afraid memories are goinmg to be it for this trp.  I'm going back to Crane's in late Sepember. You can bt this time my camera will be a bit more secured.  By the way, Crane's is a great place.....vey nice owners and staff, and good food."
99085,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-30 13:27:00,2585,ah sorry to hear about the camera! that sucks man.  looks like you guys had a great trip!  Cheers!
99086,Joey,2007-07-30 13:29:00,9122,"Well that is very unfortunate about your cooler and camera.  Sorry to hear that man.  Otherwise is does sound like you had a good time and caught some decent fish, great report.  Joey"
99087,scuro,2007-07-30 13:32:00,386,Too bad about the lost gear!

99141,dustink,2007-07-30 15:42:00,526,Sounds like a great trip....sorry about the camera!  dk
99190,davew3,2007-07-30 17:29:00,430,"Sounds like a good time. For the kids sunshine is nice. Rain brings boredom.  Just in case, have you called the camp to see if the cooler is there.  I do not know what size boat you have but to make it fly with stuff in it you must have hit one good bump in the road.  Also I do not know what kind of cooler but my plastic one rides with out moving when empty and I haul a 15 foot split screen fishing boat.  I hope you get it back."
99237,fishboy,2007-07-30 19:22:00,550,good fishing-too bad 'bout the gear
99275,Rich Clemens,2007-07-30 21:32:00,3131,"Nice report BigCreekDad ...glad you finally got into some fish.   Maybe we'll run into each other on the water in late September, I'm staying at Wolseley Lodge from 9/22 to 9/29.    Cabin number 1 ... the one right next to the bridge that leads over to Totem Point.  I'll have the Tracker Targa V17 WT - including the better half and two dogs.   Hard to miss this circus coming through.    Hoping to catch me a lunge to or two."
