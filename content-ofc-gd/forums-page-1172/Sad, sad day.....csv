And he would tell you: ""Time will heal, Though maybe not tomorrow"".  He would be here if he could, To comfort you in grieving. And he would tell you: ""I'm at peace, Don't fret about my leaving"".  He would be here if he could, But he has given you his best. And now after years of giving, Its' time for him to rest. ________________________________  Our condolences to you and your family John.

Although I am very fortunate to be able to return to the UK 2 or 3 times a year, it is painfully difficult to ""see"" someone you love and respect lose their battle with this dreadful disease inch by inch, from 3,000 miles away.  As many of you said, he is at peace with the one he loved dearly.  John & Barbara........"

99104,John,2007-07-30 14:05:00,2956,"We lost my Dad over the weekend. The world will be a lesser place without him.  As some of you knew, he had been battling lung cancer. Against all odds he managed to live with it for a year and a half and had a pretty good quality of life. We talked practically daily and his quick witted sense of humour continued strong until the last week or so when he deteriorated quite rapidly. As he hadn't been able to eat or talk for a few days, his passing on was a blessing.  Dad had selflessly dedicated 8 1/2 of the last 10 years of his life to taking care of my Mom who had many health problems. Eventually she passed away from complications associated with her illness. He never really got over losing her and talked often about their being together once again.  Although I will be away in the UK for the next couple of weeks I hope to still get to the Firehall tomorrow night to have a beer or two in his honour.  John...."
