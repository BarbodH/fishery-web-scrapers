Although the incision area (right along the belt line) is still quite tender, as long as I keep my mail satchels under 20 pounds, and go easy, I SHOULD be fine. That's gonna be tough . ..    10 pounds of mail . . . .   10 pounds of doggie treats! If I hadn't had the OFC board to keep caught up, I'da had one of those shirts with the wrap-around sleeves to wear! My carp fishin' bud  (from jolly ol' over 'ome) hits the shores of 'the colonies' August 1 . . .   says it's been a tad dampish over there lately. Now . . ..    I get to see if they were able to run the office without me for nearly 3 weeks .... musta been tough!  P. S. Remember how he started his '05 holiday over here? O O O O  U  C   H!!  "
