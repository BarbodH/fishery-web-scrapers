99337,Chuck Best,2007-07-31 00:10:00,308,"Anyone who knows that we just got a new(to us)boat,would have seen the trolling motor on the front.It's a Minn Kota,well, last weekend while we were out ,the motor dropped into place while crusin'.I stopped quickly and brought it up into place and never thought of it again,till yesterday,when I went to use it.It almost locked into place ,but wouldn't stay down under power.After closer inspection,I noticed some small pieces of broken cast metal and a bent pin.On the net to find a dealer I go,low and behold ""Rockey's tackle services"",in Orillia. I took it up there today and the guy looks at me and says""It came down while driving didn't it"",""yup"" I said,I showed him the receipt I got from the previos boat owner and he says give me 1/2 an hour.I grab a pop and a chair and in twenty mins. he had her fixed as good as new and I am the owner on the warranty card.......the thing is only 8 months old and the other guy never register it....YAHOO,I said..........I would HIGHLY recommend this guy and his shop for any other fix its........he does rods ,reels,electric motors and even scotty riggers.......the number in Orillia is 705-325-3526.........Thx again Rockey........TC and tight lines all....."

99435,Chuck Best,2007-07-31 09:26:00,308,"It's not the motors,Rockey told me,They're just not very clear on telling people about the ""travel collar "".It has to al the way down to lock it in,he said.....and I noticed there's a big sticker on the new casing ,explaining it..........TC and tight lines.......Chuck......"
