All three were fishing with Marc yesterday and well...you should have seen the smile on Ed's face. It was priceless! Ed was king of the day as he got the tanker yesterday.  This was a 55 incher and rumour has it that there was a steeple in the background. I'm sure they'll be posting as soon as they get back home. Thanks again so much for dropping by, guys."
