I was there for a week and if i remember correctly the lake wasnt rocky at all we werent in a boat though so maybe in different parts it is. But i do remember going out in a paddle boat with my dad and we went over some rocks and the thing that spins at the bottom (dont remember what its called broke and we got stuck in the middle of the lake for quite some time until the waves took us ashore. We only fished with worms for we werent that into fishing it was just something we tried while we were there and we liked it most of the things to do there i remember i would be swimming and i could see walleye in no more than 4 fow. It may be rocky because it is near stony lake and i was there last year it was pretty rocky but more weeds than rocks that i saw. Good luck.  Bassmaster4"
