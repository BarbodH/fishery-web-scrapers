98938,Fish Farmer,2007-07-29 23:33:00,2234,"But there's a downside -- it was a grass carp, a cousin of the fish it was mistaken for.  And just like that other behemoth, the grass carp is a destructive species that doesn't belong in the Great Lakes.  Does it make any difference. Maybe it's going to take a little longer. Panic or not!"
99248,fishboy,2007-07-30 19:51:00,550,"  but Photoz-it's way more fun to wind everyone up with a pseudo-news story-kinda like battling a 40"" pike on 4# test."
98756,Bob,2007-07-28 21:37:00,370,"The canal that connects the Mississippi system to the Great Lakes is at Chicago.  If these carp come through that, you'll hear about their spread through Lake Michigan and down through Lake Huron long before they get near Sarnia or Lake Erie.  Some eastern cultures believe in buying live fish, two at a time, one to eat and the other to release.  This is why sale of live Asian carp has been banned."
98778,fishindevil,2007-07-28 23:35:00,6254,Well from what they say its only a matter of time....and like a member said why dont they ban the sale of them....and put more measures in place sportfishing is over a 1 BILLION dollar industry in the great lakes....you would think that both sides would do a little more about this situation.....i wanna freak out on someone in charge....im ticked....grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

98804,Sinker,2007-07-29 03:17:00,8692," I suppose your right in saying there's not much WE (me and you personally) can do......but if we all work together there has to be a way to help. I'd gladly warm the barrel of my shotgun ridding the ecosystem of a few  I know I'll be out there with the bow killing them as often as I can if/when they get here.....  Like I said above.....the barrier in Chicago isn't gonna stop them.....it may slow them down, but I watched a video of the carp going right thru it without as much as a flinch.    One of my profs at school was working on the barriers there, he made the video I watched, and he told me the only way to stop them is to kill them all.......how we gonna do that? Its  gonna be a problem sooner or later.......It will only be a matter of time!  I see plenty of reasons to panick!  Sinker"
98805,Rich,2007-07-29 03:25:00,3927,Anyone remember the snakehead scare?
98806,Sinker,2007-07-29 03:31:00,8692,  Did you see any videos of snake heads jumping out of the water and injuring people.....have you seen the videos of these carp??  If you think this is just a scare.....your in for a big surprise!!  The reality of it is that its already too late.....they'll get here sooner or later......
98912,joonmoon,2007-07-29 21:12:00,528,"Does anyone here think that maybe...just maybe that the Scugog and Kawarthas carp die offs are somewhat related here...hmmm. Someone/organization is working on a remedy to rid us of carp and that Scugog was the testing area gone bad, Lake X if you will...maybe figuring that the toxins dumped in the lake would be diluted before it reached Sturgeon or downstream from there...man were they mistaken. I believe they have come up with some data and possibly preparing to dump it into the Great Lakes to reduce or kill off the new invading carp species...Why else would the MNR and Fish and Wildlife Services be taking so long to ID the problem in the Kawarthas...its' because they know whats goin on and don't want to let on they do. IT'S A CONSPIRACY....OH NO.  Relax think how a huge carp would fight on lite line...awesome."
