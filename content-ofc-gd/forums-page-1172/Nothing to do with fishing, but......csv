Built in the 1100's ad, but remodelled in the 1300's, this gatehouse is now 2 apartments, I was just called in to do a small repair. It's awesome to be able to walk around a place that's 700 years old   Check out the walls, 3ft sold stone walls  "
98887,Clampet,2007-07-29 17:48:00,1947,Sure 'nuff ta a feller wonder.. Kinda reminds me of a Led Zep album cover..  
98896,Rich Clemens,2007-07-29 18:32:00,3131,Cool pics.  I can really get into the medievel buildings.   Had a grea time walking through old town Cantebury about 10 years ago and some old towns in Switerland a number of years back.  Would love to do it again someday.

98922,pikehunter,2007-07-29 22:34:00,1659," Yep, I would say that it is a tad overdue for a remodel or plumbing work!  Just think, over on this side of the pond if a building is over 80 years old we consider that to be ancient. Built in the 1100's now that qualifies to be an historic building for sure!"
98957,Daplumma,2007-07-30 00:45:00,1961,Cool stuff.Being a fellow plumber I am wondering what sort of repair was needed there.I cringe when I get a service call for a house from the 40 or 50's.Old stuff is tough to repair and a simple job can turn into an all day thing because it seems everything you touch crumbles in your hand.

99068,ccmtcanada,2007-07-30 12:50:00,7971,"Great pics!  I was just talking about a trip I made to England back in my last year of high school almost 20 years ago.  We were there for 16 days, but one of the highlights for me was walking through Fountains Abbey...over 800 years old...completely blew me away!!!"
99209,njones,2007-07-30 18:23:00,24,"Come visit us ! You can get so much help and advice. Don't listen to these tours, some of the best parts to see aren't on the bus tour routes. The only way to see the UK is pick an area and just see that. If you live in Toronto, You can get to many regional airports, Air Transat and Canadian Affair do fares from $500 return, any Brits on this site would be happy to advise. My area around Durham has so much scenery, history within a 2 hour drive, you wouldn't believe it!"
