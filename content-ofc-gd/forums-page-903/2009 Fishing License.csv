287514,diggyj,2009-01-04 03:05:00,548,"2009 fishing licences  Is it true that you no longer get a sticker for your valid Outdoors Card? You need to fill out a form, pay the fee.  Then you get a paper license.  Do you then need to carry both the paper licence and the Outdoor Card or just the paper?  Im sure some of you can confirm or deny this since you are avid ice fishermen.  Thanks.  Dirk...."
287535,Bondar,2009-01-04 03:30:00,817,"you only get a paper licence if your outdoors card was expired and that is only temporary until your card comes in the mail , i bought mine friday and they put a sticker on it"
287538,Canuck2fan,2009-01-04 03:35:00,1444,I think that if you go on the website and renew without a card then you must print that out and carry it with you and your unexpired outdoor card.... If you go to an outlet that sells licences they give a sticker.
287547,Ramble,2009-01-04 03:53:00,713,"We covered this about 6 months ago i think.  New 1 year, requiring a new card-temporary paper liscence until ur card arrives.  1 year with a card NOT expired you get a sticker.  if you by your 1 year online, then all you will ever have is the piece of paper.  get a 3 year online, temporary print out, and the card will come in the mail.  -R-"

300472,nautifish,2009-02-02 14:20:00,1416,Yip you can renew your licence on line.  You must print it out and carry it with ur ontario outdoors card.  With out your card the printed peice of paper is invalid.

300975,GBW,2009-02-03 16:19:00,8460,the e-license is a royal pain the the....  Go to a store and get a sticker and if you need a new card then do what Rambleon said and get a 3-year one...
