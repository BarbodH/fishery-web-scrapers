The area is just west of the red buoy and should be avoided. The truck did go through and it will be a recovery operation at a later date. The anglers were locals and I will not state who they were just that we are pleased that they are safe. The last couple of days the weather has been warm and the underwater currents in that area has made ice unsafe for vehicles.  If you are heading out there be safe and watch for the barricade so that no one else goes through.  Best regards, Sam"
