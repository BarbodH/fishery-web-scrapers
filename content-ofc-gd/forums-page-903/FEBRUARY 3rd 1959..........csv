300918,motv8tr,2009-02-03 13:23:00,2587,It was a very sad day indeed.....  Maureen
300983,misfish,2009-02-03 16:54:00,29133,I thought you were going to say it was the day you were born.  Three of the all time greats.
301036,kickingfrog,2009-02-03 21:20:00,8333,"But february made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver. Bad news on the doorstep; I couldn't take one more step.  I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride, But something touched me deep inside The day the music died.  So bye-bye, miss american pie. Drove my chevy to the levee, But the levee was dry. And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye Singin', ""this'll be the day that I die. ""this'll be the day that I die.""  "
301107,BassAsin,2009-02-04 00:42:00,806,"Did you write the book of love, And do you have faith in God above, If the Bible tells you so? Do you believe in rock n roll, Can music save your mortal soul, And can you teach me how to dance real slow?"
301347,ffej,2009-02-04 17:23:00,14,"Heard a funny story on the radio yesterday about this.  As you may or may not know, there are many, many websites out there that have theories on what each line of this song means.  (Just to a google search of ""intrepretation of the lyrics to American Pie"" if you have any interest).  But according to the story, when Don Maclean was asked at some point (I dont know when) to explain what the song means, his reply was ""IT MEANS I NEVER HAVE TO WORK AGAIN""."
301351,Roy,2009-02-04 17:40:00,13728,A little trivia related to this is that Waylon Jennings was scheduled to be on that plane. He was Holly's bassist. But gave his seat to one of the others...don't remember if it was the Big Bopper or Valens.
301352,dheitzner,2009-02-04 17:45:00,314," Beat me to the punch Roy! Such a sad day, I've really enjoyed Buddy Holly's music since I was a child. The first of many rockers to die far too young. Darc"
