301130,misfish,2009-02-04 01:26:00,29133,"I was talking today, what if GSP could get up to the 200+ mark.I know that Lesner is a monster,but what a match. Yeah Im crazy to think them both in the octogon together,but just amagine. David and Goligth."
301135,Guest CaptainSpaulding,2009-02-04 01:33:00,0, So what?  Doesn't mean he knows anything?  Might mean he's biased though...  nice try buddy.

301142,Guest CaptainSpaulding,2009-02-04 01:42:00,0, You want a medal for that?
301145,Terry,2009-02-04 01:45:00,14456,well as long as you understand that most if not all people reading  this thread think you look  foolish and it's growing with each of your posts then go for it knock yourself out  I was trying to save you the embarrassment but some people just go for broke
301147,steverowbotham,2009-02-04 01:47:00,1800, LOL.
301151,irishfield,2009-02-04 01:55:00,26272, I'm just trying to get over the fact that it took you a full day to figure it out....
301158,Roy,2009-02-04 01:57:00,13728,Nite cap. I was kinda hoping it wouldn't come to this but I have a full box of paperclips to sort tonight so I don't have time to watch the thread.
301172,misfish,2009-02-04 02:10:00,29133,"Go for it Roy,lock em out.The whole bunch of them.LOL"
301175,steverowbotham,2009-02-04 02:12:00,1800,the best part is he knows he's a goof and his insecurities cause him to keep going rather than admit defeat.
301184,douG,2009-02-04 02:23:00,2693," Mr. Spaulding, I was being gentle with you, after all, you are new around here.  I will do that again, because we all lose if one of us loses.  No hard feelings, but you should know that fighting stays at the dojo, we don't do that here. It pisses off the advertisers, and if they go away, so does this.  I don't want that to happen.  Most of the members here use this resource to share questions, plans, ask for ideas, and encourage others. We all enjoy if one of us has a great trip, and we feel the pain when something goes wrong. We have learned to use computers, cameras, lans, gps, and boats motors and fishing gear too.  We have also talked about personal losses, with great honesty and sincerity.  I have met with 93 board members over the last 6 years, and without exception have enjoyed every single conversation.  I am nobody around here, and I welcome other nobodies at any time, for what that is worth.  I value this community, and work for it, and respect those that earn that respect."
301281,holdfast,2009-02-04 13:24:00,1813,"  Capt Spaulding, send me a PM and Ill tell ya about how some people work on this forum, Gang up, Call ya a Liar, Jealousy, and how to be kind gentle, and feely nicy touchy touchy.  I got lots of experience seems Ive been locked more often than most. PM me before this gets locked.  Ive never seen the fight but Ive been getting more and more interested in the Ultimate fighter thing.  I don't take judo but like you I love rough sports, IE Canadian hockey, Hockey fights etc.  Thanks to your point of view on the fight I'm looking forward to seeing it.  I had been following all the Hype leading up to it.  Yea post some fishing Pictures, maybe it'll quiet things down here.  By the way.  I don't take sides for the most part on this forum because its a pet peeve of mine.  My very first post I was called a Liar when I said I caught a huge laker in less than one foot of water underneath about eight feet of ice."
301282,Spiel,2009-02-04 13:29:00,9065," That won't be happening. But you could tell me if you like, I'd be happy to listen.  Just heard the bell, I believe this one's over."

300822,Guest CaptainSpaulding,2009-02-03 03:50:00,0," That's all just PR bullcrap.  Of course, they would deny anything this soon into the game...  Basically, one of two things are going to happen:  1) Money is exchanged.  This scandal just goes away...  2) BJ gets a re-match and their fight result is nullified."
300828,douG,2009-02-03 03:59:00,2693,"Welcome to the Captain. He has posted nine times on OFC, AND THEY'RE ALL ON THIS THREAD.  That's just SuperDoo."

I just got access to the forum about 4 hours ago and I just got back from doing some shoppin' during that time!  If you wanna swap fishin' tales I'll gladly chime in with ya, lad!  Geez, its been a busy day..."
300838,Guest CaptainSpaulding,2009-02-03 04:13:00,0," No, man... he's just been hit so few times that his face 'is fresh'... if that makes any sort of sense.  Its a testament to his skill...  Most fighters have been hit and cut so many times that their cuts either re-open or the 'friction or jarring' of the scar tissue increases the pressure on the skin and a new cut forms.  Either that or his skin is the same as a shark... shark skin is rough though isn`t it?"
300839,Guest CaptainSpaulding,2009-02-03 04:14:00,0, Done like dinner?

This conspiracy stuff is great!!!!  Maybe BJ should have done a few more under the water rock walking exercises."
300845,douG,2009-02-03 04:23:00,2693,"Captain, maybe it's just me, but when I try something new, with new folks, I just sorta lay back and try to get the lay of the land so to speak.  First impressions are lasting, and I always try to help out where I can, I want to leave a good impression so I get invited back.  Best of luck to you in your future endeavors.  Dinner.  Fresh roasted troll  1 medium sized troll 1 cup minced garlic 1/3 cup olive oil  Mix the oil and garlic.  Rub the mixture over the troll.  Roast over an open flame until crispy brown.

300858,Guest CaptainSpaulding,2009-02-03 04:48:00,0," That's fine, buddy.  I do understand why you wrote that and I do understand the 'internet troll' concept.  That's where you and I differ I guess... I don't lay back and consider '1st impressions'.  I just got access literally a few hours ago.  I saw the GSP thread, I am a huge MMA fan and it is in fact my hobby although I only practice Judo (hell yeah!).  This fight was huge and so I naturally chimed in with my views of which most people disagree with and usually laugh at.  I do have to wonder though how you feel that you have the right to judge me and right derogatory messages about me based upon 10 or so messages...  Man! Its been like 4 hours since I got access and I was out shopping for half of that!  what the heck?!  Don't worry buddy, I'll get the fishing posts up there asap!  Sorry it wasn't fast enough for you boss!"
300865,douG,2009-02-03 05:09:00,2693,"CaptainSpaulding,  I don't know anything about you, so judging you would just make me look silly.  I didn't make any remarks about you at all, but I did comment on what you said - there is a big difference.  I just wondered if that was the best way to make an introduction.  You can try again, or not, your call."

Shook hands with Rashad Evans, Michael Bisbain, Dan Henderson, Matt Brown, Clay the Carpenter and out of no where The lead singer for the Red Hot Chilli Peppers! What a great weekend!  Ab"
301059,steverowbotham,2009-02-03 22:31:00,1800,"MMA fans make me laugh, because they all know everything about everything."
301070,misfish,2009-02-03 23:11:00,29133," If you watch the game as you say,you would of seen the part  where BJ challanged GSP.Right after his win.Show boating sorta speak. Whos the dumb one there? He asked for it,he got it. As for GSP dropping down and being dominated??????????????? I strongly believe GSP was be even more dominating.  This of course, is just my opinion."
301075,Cudz,2009-02-03 23:25:00,2652,"Yeah you are right.  BJ has crazy skills.  GSP was just too much for him on that night.  That is what is great about MMA anyone can win.  BJ will come back and be a very good LW fighter for some time.  He needs to stay there because GSP is too big and strong for him right now.  Even if BJ has the better boxing skills and jujitsu, GSP's strength and insane wrestling overwhelmed even the very talented Penn."
301116,Guest CaptainSpaulding,2009-02-04 00:55:00,0, Still better than you though since you know nothing about anything.
301117,Guest CaptainSpaulding,2009-02-04 00:57:00,0, How much was your ticket?  Guida's the best!
301119,Terry,2009-02-04 01:05:00,14456,"CaptainSpaulding, you may want to check out the names of some of the people you are arguing with before you look real silly, hobby for you job for others here  try Rowbotham and MMA in google you just told him you know more then him and a few other names on this board and see how many family members here fight in MMAs  some of the guys do know what they are talking about"
300813,Guest CaptainSpaulding,2009-02-03 03:32:00,0, Sherdog doesn't have the latest information.  BJ's lawyer has already filed.  The NSAC is going to come down hard on GSP and his team.  Nevada is basically the sports betting centre of the world and they can't have any sort of cheating occuring or even speculated at.  They are to make an example of this situation to maintain their reputation.
300814,Guest CaptainSpaulding,2009-02-03 03:34:00,0, It only appeared to be pure dominance.  It was an uneven playing field that kept BJ from using his main skill which is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.  Nobody can do anything against a bigger opponent if he is greased up.
300008,Bassman27,2009-02-01 06:28:00,98,"This was an awesome performance by GSP, he dominated every aspect of the fight and after 4 rounds of pummeling,Penn's corner threw in the towel.....TKO win for St.Pierre.  Bassman"
300011,Cudz,2009-02-01 06:32:00,2652,that was sweet.  I have never seen Penn Be dominated like that. Is Penn's skin the same skin found on Sharks?  That dude does not cut easily.
300012,steverowbotham,2009-02-01 06:33:00,1800,"According to Websters Online, the spelling of the word Destruction has been changed to GSP"
300014,Bassman27,2009-02-01 06:36:00,98,"I am really impressed with St Pierre, Penn is one tough son of a gun and as far as i know has never been dominated like that.GSP should call Serra and thank him, since that fight he lost  he's been a whole new GSP!!!!"
300015,young_one,2009-02-01 06:38:00,620,"Penn is pretty tough! I bet after Penn told GSP is a quiter from another fight, he would not tap himself out either, telling people he has heart for the fight. GSP is a beast, scary to think that Im the same height, but no where near the strength or skill. 5'10"
300017,SlowPoke,2009-02-01 06:49:00,2984,Throw a NF (non fishing) in the title will ya? I thought you were doing a reel comparison.
300022,bucktail,2009-02-01 07:03:00,1857,"Awesome performance by GSP , what a chin on Penn!!! he took a punch in the second that should have knocked out any person out there!! I would hate to be his face in the morning, I do wish the ref had stopped it halfway thru the 3rd as I thought BJ was taking way too much punishment without answering back."
300024,TerryC,2009-02-01 07:25:00,196,"Penn was in way to deep with this one, better to stick with the punching bags at 155, Time to start thinking Silva (spider)vs GSP in UFC # 100. I can see it coming already.  Clarence"
300044,BUSTER,2009-02-01 12:22:00,1336,spider vs gsp
300067,Cudz,2009-02-01 14:03:00,2652,I am actually glad Herb didn't stop.  No excuses of early stoppage. It was a title fight.  Good reffereeing I thought. I do not want BJ to be injured though either.  GSP vs Anderson will be good bt I think that is a big step up for GSP.  Kind of like Penn fighting welterweight.  I want it to happen but at the same time I don't
300106,Mark Kulik,2009-02-01 15:46:00,348,"I normally don't condone a beating in the cage, but watching the trash-talk clips with Penn , I was glad GSP-shut him up! Penn did nt even whimper a protest when the doctor and corner stopped the fight."
300124,Jigger,2009-02-01 17:08:00,1237,"Wow did GSP ever turn it up for that fight! Love his comments on preparing a strategy for BJ, very specific and worked to a tee for him."
300125,Mattones,2009-02-01 17:12:00,587,watched it for free on mt PC from a live feed.
300126,PatrickGG,2009-02-01 17:12:00,562," My Thoughts exactly, all that trash talk and death threats made GSP go out there with %110 and made Penn feel like he put his foot in his mouth."
300133,steverowbotham,2009-02-01 17:30:00,1800, 2 words ... cheap and illegal
300134,TJQ,2009-02-01 17:37:00,7806,We bought the fight last nite.... its cheaper than a nite out at the movies and much more fun!!  All the fights were good and we were hooting and hollering at the end!!
300135,Guest gbfisher,2009-02-01 17:39:00,0,....cheap and illegal.  What feed?......
300136,Mattones,2009-02-01 17:40:00,587, It was posted on another forum i go to. one of the two links where shut down but this one took me though the entire PPV.  Cheap yes. Illegal.. It wont be me in doo doo I wasent streaming it  GSP rocked BJ.
300139,SNAGKING,2009-02-01 17:57:00,43,How about that Machida vs Silva fight? First round KO. He's quickly climbing the charts.
300150,Whitespinnerbait,2009-02-01 18:43:00,2038,"GSP is a freak , i mean the Dude is a Machine....."
300155,steverowbotham,2009-02-01 19:12:00,1800,"maybe its just me, but i was brought up with the mentality to support what you love.  If you love mma enough to find the streams, then why not get a group together and order it, or go to the bar where they paid for it and support the sport and the organization?  The UFC gives us free events all the time, why not support them when they have the PPV's.  Just my 2 cents"
300164,joco,2009-02-01 19:39:00,57,"he took a punch in the second that should have knocked out any person out there!! I would hate to be his face in the morning,   could be a good AD FOR ADVIL..HAHAHA..OR TYLINOL.   I GUES BJ WILL SHUT IS MOUTH NOW. hawain punch boy  JOCO........"
300177,T.Barry,2009-02-01 20:31:00,24,"Read this on a MMA site and hope it is not true.  GSP dominated but I would hate to see if this was true.    B.J. Penn's camp has filed a formal complaint with the Nevada State Athletic Commission over Vaseline that was allegedly rubbed on Georges St. Pierre's back between rounds one and two. UFC president Dana White said at the post-fight press conference that he was aware of the complaint, and said he personally witnessed members of the commission take the Vaseline away from GSP's camp and rebuke them in the Octagon between rounds.  ""I saw the commission jump up there and flipping out,"" said Dana White. They said one of the guys was rubbing Vaseline on Georges' back in between rounds. It was one and two, I think.""  ""The guys from the athletic commission went up there and started screaming at them. Knocked the Vaseline and kicked the Vaseline out of the Octagon.""  White added that ""some Vaseline on a guy's back didn't change the outcome of that fight, but you don't do it,"" and said the blame should fall on the cornerman responsible and not GSP.  ""If a guy was intentionally putting Vaseline on a guy's back, he should never corner a mixed martial arts fight again.""  As for what becomes of the complaint now, White said it's out of his hands.  ""Who knows. That's up to the commission."""
300195,kickingfrog,2009-02-01 21:19:00,8333,I thought this thread had to do with some unknown reel vs a Penn...yawn.
300196,Jigger,2009-02-01 21:21:00,1237,"They rubbed it off before the round started. If BJ had been a little more proactive, I could see this complaint getting somewhere. But seeing as it was a completely one-sided affair, I can't see this carrying any weight."
