301291,maybe,2009-02-04 14:03:00,307,"http://www.springfishingandboatshow.com  Feb 13-16 at the International Centre, which is at 6900 Airport Rd Mississauga (northeast side of Airport, south of Derry).  Free surface parking.  Don't forget the ""OFC Meet Greet & Bleep"" being held at Dave Mercer's booth at 1pm Saturday.  Not sure which of the booths on the 2009 floorplan is Dave's.  I've got an email in to Vita asking for a booth number to exhibitor name crossreference, will post whatever information I get back."
