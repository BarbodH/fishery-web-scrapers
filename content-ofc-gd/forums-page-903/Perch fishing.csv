300625,12footspringbok,2009-02-02 21:44:00,459,Was too damn tired to get the photos off my camera and onto  the comp last night and was busy watching a little football too. Anyhow decided to go with the short walk sunday and target some perch. Headed out at 7am and walked about a kilometer punched a hole turned on the fishfinder 18ft too shallow. Walked about another hundred yards punched another hole 24ft still a little too shallow for my liking in this particular spot. So about another hundred yards or so i was in 28ft and my friend and i had the hut all set up and we were ready to rock. Took about five minutes to get the first one but then it was on. After about 10am the action died down considerably and we only got the odd one. Anyhow ended up getting i would say 60-70 perch between the two of us with 20 nice keepers and 3 or 4 that were prime 12 or so inch spawners i figured should go back. All and all was a pretty good weekend on simcoe for me.
