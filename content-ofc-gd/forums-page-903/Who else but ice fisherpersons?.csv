300601,Seaweed,2009-02-02 20:02:00,135,I too was up before the birds on Sunday  I was heading out to a new spot on the Ottawa river.  I unloaded the snowmachine... attached the clam to the back and off I went.  It was dark and this being a new spot and knowing I had to cross a bit of current... I elected to stop half-way there near some huts and fish there until sunup  Well I unbuckled the Jiffy... pull pull... check the choke.... pull pull  Long story short.... my old reliable that has never let me down Jiffy choose that day to throw a spring off of the idler arm or somthing like that.  I tried to re-rig it but with freezing fingers and tiny springs.... I gave up an hour later.... jumped on the snowmachine and headed back to the truck.  What was supposed to be a great mild day on the ice... turned in to a warm nap on the couch and some wings and Superbowl later on.  I will be taking the Jiffy to the doctor tomorrow.
