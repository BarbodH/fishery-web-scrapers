299188,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-29 22:21:00,182,Okay so I arranged to meet my friend form missisauga down there on saturday at the Boat Launch above the falls near the whirl pools   what does that mean... well i know what it means but how the HELL do I get there... plz help me
299196,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-29 22:38:00,182,"Lol, I forgot too mention that I only have 9 flies Popsicle 2 egg sucking leeches purple/black caddis larve autmn wooly bugger crystal beadhead bugger (green) duddles steelehad stone Great lakes nymph carp Creek"
299214,solopaddler,2009-01-29 23:03:00,8605,"Still tons of ice and slush especially in the whirlpool, I'd wait a bit."
299216,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-29 23:05:00,182,"Lol, i wish i could, im there for a hockey tourney so its now or never"
299218,Ziki,2009-01-29 23:13:00,128,Who is your buddy?? The whirlpool is below the falls. Anyone else see something fishy about all this?
299228,BillM,2009-01-29 23:39:00,17367,"I think you are talking the Queenston ramp, I myself just figured out where it was (Thanks Jack! lol)  You are going to have a real tough time down there with a flyrod, it's big river.  I would bring a spinning setup as backup."
299233,Hellfish,2009-01-30 00:03:00,308,"The whirlpool is certainly below the falls, flyfishing @ queenston would be a little difficult that to say the least as was said earlier you want to hit up the glen or the whirpool with your fly rod im sure it is possible to flyfish queenston but with the amount of ppl that will be out there soon it will be nearly impossibly.  If Paul or niagrafisher read this thread im sure they will chime in with some info on flyfishing the mighty niagara"
299243,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-30 00:32:00,182,"My friends name is Matthew Saivea, ehs a centre pin guy and says he gonna bottom bounce, i figure if im down there I may as well wet a line... right?"
299244,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-30 00:34:00,182,thats where im talking bout ... the boat launch at dumbfires and princess street
299251,charlied,2009-01-30 00:46:00,584,get yourself on the niagara parkway.  go past the power plant and stick to your right at the circle after the power plant.  go down the hill and dumphreys is like the second street at the bottom of the hill.  make a right turn on dumphreys and follow that straight thru 2 stop signs and continue going straight.  can't miss the launch
299255,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-01-30 00:54:00,182,"THANK YOU!, is it a productive spot?"
299284,charlied,2009-01-30 01:46:00,584,it can be  if you know how to fish it.  Like some of the other guys said it is not a fly fishing spot but maybe your friend will set you up with a bottom bouncing set-up.  Alot of fish hold in there before the spring run up the rapids.
299886,dnb_cbr,2009-02-01 01:12:00,61,"Well, how did it go?  I just seen your partner's facebook status.  It said he got 9 chromers.  That's a great day for sure!  How was the ice flow situation?"
300303,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-02-02 00:46:00,182,"lol, didnt even go...IM really cheezed, like i died a little on the inside"
300359,BillM,2009-02-02 03:19:00,17367,"You wouldn't have even made a cast, you didn't miss out on much.  So much ice flow I made maybe 5 decent drifts with my float setup on Saturday and that was it.  Chatted with a few guys down there, all were bottom bouncing.  Flyfishing would have been an even worse decision"
300660,MarcusDiGiovanni,2009-02-02 23:05:00,182,"Pfew, okay good, i didnt miss much"
