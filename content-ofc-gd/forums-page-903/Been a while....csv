Worked for the summer up in the NWT at Ekati diamond mine and didn't get much time off, only fished twice all summer, and I've been super busy at school, graduating from NipU at the end of the semester! But cabin fever set in and I figured I would come check out how things have been around here. I am hoping to get out on Nipissing for at least a couple days during my ""reading"" break. I should be around for a while now though, well until exams when I become a hermit and only leave the house to write them,  . Good to be back though, not enough people my age like fishing as much as they should!"
301091,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-04 00:16:00,2585,welcome back hope you get the chance to be on nip this year.  great fishing for the most part!  Cheers!

301245,BassAsin,2009-02-04 05:36:00,806,i dont know how old you are but i'm 21 and do nothin but fish and live in north bay.
301302,Maverick,2009-02-04 14:58:00,371,"I'm 25 and there's nothin I would rather be doing than fishing but school is taking a front seat for now, only 2 and a half more months. I might try to get out this weekend though. Does anybody know if you can drive out at Wades Landing to the islands out there? I only have a 2wd pick up so it would need to be a decent road."
301307,diggyj,2009-02-04 15:06:00,548,Hopefully you lined your pockets with some of them diamonds from the mine....LMAO
