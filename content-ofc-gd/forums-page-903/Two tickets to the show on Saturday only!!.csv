""A lake may be defined as any inland body of standing water, usually freshwater, larger than a pool or a pond. Canada is famous for its number of lakes. There are at least as many as two million lakes of all sizes covering, in total, 8.9 per cent of the country. Also, Canada has 563 lakes with a surface area greater than 100 square kilometres. A complete list is given in the Facts about Canada section of The Atlas of Canada. The largest set of lakes, the Great Lakes, straddle the Canadaâ€“United States boundary, accounting for 18% of the world's freshwater in lakes."""

301206,rob v,2009-02-04 03:05:00,535,"Territory of Canada Land Mass The total area of Canada is 9 984 670 kilometres square. Of this, 9 093 507 kilometres square is land and 891 163 square kilometres is fresh water. Canada's area is the second largest in the world (after Russia which has a total area of 17 075 000 square kilometres).   From a fact sheet on Canada - published by the Gov't of Canada.  That works out to 8.92531 %    ))  Oh and meet, greet and bleep."
