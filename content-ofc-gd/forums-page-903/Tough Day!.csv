Beautiful sunny day and the wind wasn't too bad. Unfortunately the fish would not co-operate.  Today's total: 1 perch,  1 mud puppy.  Too nice a day to be indoors. "

300354,rockfish,2009-02-02 02:55:00,91,"Well although got out there later with the gf ( the only one sitting down of course, all huddled up   ) we came, we searched and we found out that the bite has still been slow in alot of places.   WE know there are fish under that ice so we shall return to search again.  "

300766,smokin joe,2009-02-03 01:53:00,226,"As you stated Bruce, even though the fish didn't want to cooperate it was still a great day to be out     We'll have to get back out there soon."
