298402,Zubris21,2009-01-28 03:51:00,563,"As some have said Pearl Jam puts out some great DVD's live at the Gardens was awsome how they shook that stage, and I think they played their entire repertory in their 3 day stint there. Personally though I think I like the Live on tour dvd from 2000 I think.  Other ones that you must see are...  The Last Waltz by The Band - Some guest performances from Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and more.  Festival Express - Musical Documentary of the ""Festival Express"" music festivals that rocked through Toronto, WInnipeg and Calgary in 1970 - Acts include the Greatful Dead, The Band again and Janis Joplin just months before she lost her life."
298423,holdfast,2009-01-28 05:03:00,1813,"I just picked up Blueman Group, Jetro Tull..Jack in the Grass, and Enigma.  Let you know how it sounds after the Weeknd.  Also I would Recommend Alice Cooper Brutal Planet and the Eagles Live in Melbourne.  The Eagles DVD will be a good tester for your Home Theatre as the sound is excellent.  Also the picture is nice and Crisp"

297282,holdfast,2009-01-26 00:05:00,1813,"I'm collecting Music DVDs, and I'm wondering if there might be a sleeper that I may of Missed.  Here are my top five with a link and why I like them  #5  Roxy Music    Live at the Apollo-   Excellent 5.1 sound, great visuals, and I love their music. That chick on the elect violin (Oboe) just knocks me out. Great solo at the end.   #4  ZZ TOP Greatest Hits   Love their Videos, great sound only wished it was 5.1. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDE2eK_Vvsw  #3 YES 9012 Live  Probably one of my most listened to DVDs.  Fantastic concert Footage and Great sounding Music.  I love Jon Andersons voice.  Great 5.1 sound and the songs aren't your very long Yes Songs from way Back.   #2 Ozzy Osbourne Live at the Budokan  This is By far the Heaviest awesome sounding Album Ive Heard.  These Guys Rock.  Fantastic sounding and explosive sound.  Great Visuals.  What a Band with Zake Wylde and the Bassist Robert  T.  I believe hes with Metallica now too Bad,. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr4UYfF2Y_8...feature=related   #1 Pink Floyd Pulse  If only its on Blue Ray.  There is no other DVD that comes close to Visuals and Sound.  The Best Guitar Solo ever is on this Album as far as I'm concerned.  A Visual Pink Floyd's Greatest Hits.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqKkNezFG-g...feature=related http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2aOccbfAqE...feature=related  Worth mentioning Dusk to Dawn Movie http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdQuMyVg-rQ...feature=related   Gordon Lightfoot Live in Reno http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-otk4v9aRs4  Whats your Favorites?"
297286,misfish,2009-01-26 00:12:00,29133,Nice collection HF  Ya cant get enough Gorden lightfoot.  You will get more replies then you want I think.  No Zep or Rush?
297307,holdfast,2009-01-26 00:27:00,1813,"Ya I got about 4 Rush, favorite are the Cronicles, also got the HD Snakes and Ladders.  I got a Zepplin cllection and an HD The song Remains the Same.  Rarely Im in the mood for them, but I do enjoy when Im in the mood. LOL"
297380,Marko,2009-01-26 01:39:00,854,"Great collection for sure, agree on Ozzy, totally kicked ass!@ Not sure if you are a fan of Judas Priest - Rising in the east (2005), Halford sounds as good as ever and also Heaven and Hell with Dio, it was recorded few years back."
297399,Radnine,2009-01-26 01:51:00,1538,"In 1992 I had to go to Japan for work. I was in Kyoto for six weeks and it really sucked (once you got over the ""hey, I'm in Japan!"" thing). Anyhow, one night I wandered into this bar called Pub Africa and it was full of westerners. A great bunch of people that I could actually talk to. All we did was drink beer, smoke cigarettes, and watch concert videos projected onto a large screen (were DVD's out back then?). I remember seeing The Wall (Floyd) and this great Cindy Lauper concert video. I spent the rest of my time trying to get to know a cute little blond from Ottawa better. No luck with the blond, but fantastic memories of those music movies. Thanks for dredging them up. Jim"
297487,anders,2009-01-26 04:46:00,1168,My fav is Pearl Jam...Live at the Garden.  Simply awsome to me!  The way they rocked that concert was one of there best!
