I haven't heard if General Lee in Atlanta saw his shadow or not for the South.   ... but there are signs that Spring is on it's way around the house here in 'Bama!  Ol' Yellers Winter posies are bloomin' real nice like!    ... and Daffodils are starting to spring up in the gardens!     ... even the Day Lillies have decided to come up!    Y'all enjoy the ice fishin' while ya can, it won't be around too much longer!"
300512,JohnF,2009-02-02 15:35:00,3494,"Those pretenders probably waited to hear what Wiarton Willy (the real furry prognosticator) had to say. He also saw a shadow. Ergo, more durned snow.  JF"
300518,Greencoachdog,2009-02-02 15:42:00,8163,  Well if my Willy ever starts to feel Wiarton... I'll be sure to watchout for the snow!

300538,John,2009-02-02 16:34:00,2956,Reminds me of my parents place in the UK. Spring flowers bursting into bloom first week of February!  Snow is waaaaaay too deep in Wiarton for your Willie..................
300603,Billy Bob,2009-02-02 20:11:00,5865,"I thought I shot that rodent years ago. Can't be the same one. My gun nicknamed ""Chuckmate"" a Ruger Model 77 in .22-250 Rem blew him apart about 6 years ago at 278 yards. "
300604,JohnF,2009-02-02 20:20:00,3494, That's probably why he limps.  JF
300629,Billy Bob,2009-02-02 21:54:00,5865, GOOD ONE.....
300687,Ramble,2009-02-03 00:01:00,713,if he was tagged with a 22-250 he'd have a little more then a limp lolol  -R-

300764,Rattletrap2,2009-02-03 01:52:00,1652,"6 more weeks of winter?????? March 21st is in 7 weeks anyways! Even with all this damned snow piled up everywhere, you could smell spring in the air around these parts the last couple of days too."
300847,Ramble,2009-02-03 04:24:00,713,"That warm day we had last week you could feel winter loosing its grip, and you can dfinatly smell spring. It's gettin the blood going. But i think im going to miss the ice....  -R-"
