301124,bigugli,2009-02-04 01:17:00,6138,Wait til I get some good stone ground flour from one of the historic mills.

301154,douG,2009-02-04 01:57:00,2693," Ya, fer sure, but what can you do with RH bread flour and RH unbleached all purpose flour?   I would still like to compliment you on the crumb of those gorgeous loaves, but you need to post a pic of that first.  How else can I learn?   I posted pics of my first loaf, knowing nothing except my recent experience.  *tapping fingers*"
301262,bigugli,2009-02-04 07:14:00,6138,This time around just used all purpose flour.  Had to thaw a loaf. The first 2 had disappeared by the time I got back from fishing. 
301263,bigugli,2009-02-04 07:14:00,6138,D'OH!
