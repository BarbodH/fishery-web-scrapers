300972,Stoty,2009-02-03 16:14:00,2910,Get this....some little jerk(s) in Oshawa stole my Breast Cancer Ribbon that was on the back of my truck. It meant a lot to me as my mother is losing the fight to Breast Cancer right now. I just dont get what goes through peoples head's sometimes.  Does anyone know where I can get another one?  Thanks for any help.  *Stoty
