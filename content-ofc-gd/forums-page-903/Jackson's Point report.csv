300752,Joeytier,2009-02-03 01:37:00,3990,"Decided to give hard water whitefishing a try for the first time.  After a fresh dumping of snow, and day-old tracks filled in with drifting snow, the long walk out was excruciating.  We fished anywhere between 58-67 feet of water for at least 3 hours, marking the occasional fish but not even getting a touch.  We decided to head in, but decided to try some perch fishing for the last 45 minutes or so before heading.  We set up in 36 ft water and landed 2 right off the bat.  It was slow, but in 45 minutes we had 7 keepers, plus a handful more smaller ones.  The whitefish was disappointing, but at least the perch cooperated to salvage the day (somewhat).  I think I'll stick to perch on Simcoe unless I can arrange a ride out to deeper water.  I snapped a photo of the huts on the way back in:   Here's the perch before the butcher has his way with them: "
300762,Greencoachdog,2009-02-03 01:47:00,8163,Some nice fat Perch there!
300769,johnnyb,2009-02-03 01:56:00,3413,At least you got some perch...next time you could try walking out from Big Bay or Bear Point...much shorter walk to deep water there....
300779,12footspringbok,2009-02-03 02:11:00,459,Can always salvage a day with some good perch fishing on simcoe!
300790,Joeytier,2009-02-03 02:29:00,3990,Thanks for the heads up!
300825,douG,2009-02-03 03:52:00,2693,"I'm with you, JoeyTier.  Emil can do it, but walking 2 kms through deep snow in a float suit is a younger man's game.  Some fine looking perch too."
300826,young_one,2009-02-03 03:58:00,620,"Nice perch! I bet Big Bay and Bear Point was packed with people, where you went was probably quieter. Walking long distance in a Float suit is not a good thing even for a young guy like me. (19yr) The suit gets wet, cause Im heating up, wet suit = cold = negative fishing mood = no fish = skunk."
300834,Leecher,2009-02-03 04:07:00,7832,Great looking perch and good table fare Good job for your first time out Joeytier Thanks for sharing Leechman
300914,Spiel,2009-02-03 12:58:00,9065,Jackson Point can be hot fishing but without transportation the 5 to 7 km hike is too much for anyone.   The west shore is the place for us walkers. That aside you did manage to salvage the day with some nice perch.
300936,limeyangler,2009-02-03 14:40:00,5204,Nice one JT....fat perch saves the day...lol   Get the tape and the OFC Tourney Logo on one next time    Go team#3!!!!!
300938,diggyj,2009-02-03 14:43:00,548,Great looking Perch. Looks like an even better dinner.
