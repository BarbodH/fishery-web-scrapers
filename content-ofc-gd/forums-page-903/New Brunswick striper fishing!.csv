This is a L O N G one...  http://www.newbrunswickfishing.com/forum/t...p;id_topic=3456  This one is for spring fishing and is somewhat shorter.  http://www.newbrunswickfishing.com/forum/t...p;id_topic=3552  This is another fairly one but has some good GPS coordinates for launching a boat.  http://www.newbrunswickfishing.com/forum/t...p;id_topic=3519  Bring your HEAVY tackle as these puppies are big and mean   Hope that Helps  David  aka  Superdad ex NBer"
