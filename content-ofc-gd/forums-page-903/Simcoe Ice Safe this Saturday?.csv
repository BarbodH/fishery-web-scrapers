301002,Gerritt,2009-02-03 17:50:00,6129,not likely.. if on black/blue ice...Last I heard there were reports of 18+ inches of ice..... might be a wet walk back though!  G
301033,johnnyb,2009-02-03 20:45:00,3413,Yeah...make sure you have waterproof foot and leg wear...gonna be sloppy!  But the ice itself will be fine...hopefully it will make all the snow/slush disappear and then freeze back up nice and slippery-like
301044,12footspringbok,2009-02-03 21:50:00,459,It'll take more than one day of +7 to make the ice on simcoe unsafe.
301048,purekgw,2009-02-03 22:02:00,585,whats Friday going to be like?
301110,BassAsin,2009-02-04 00:46:00,806,"that would likely be the best thing that could happen!    was on a lake today just starting to get slush, hope rhe weather man is right hre as well lots of rain and warm make them lakes hard and slippy.       break out the skates!!!!"
301182,waterwolf,2009-02-04 02:23:00,556,"bring on the rain ,, lose the cursed snow .plenty of ice to weather a bit of rain. just makes it easier to get around. a foot of ice doesn't disappear overnight.   insulated rubber boots are dry and warm enough for anything on the plus side.  don't fear the chinook!!"
