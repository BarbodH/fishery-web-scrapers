301277,chickenhawk,2009-02-04 12:57:00,612,i was told chapstick works as well....don't know if anyone has already posted that or not....nor have i tried it but i was told by a guy on the river one day to put chapstick on my guides and it will keep them freezing....anyways good luck  Hawk
299843,bassmaster4,2009-01-31 23:34:00,801,The guides on my ice fishing rod keep freezing when im fishing making it hard to reel and its a real nuisance having to pick the ice off every 5 minutes. Is there something i could do to prevent it from freezing?
299845,sonny,2009-01-31 23:35:00,511,Silicone spray would help with that!
299847,bassmaster4,2009-01-31 23:47:00,801,thank you.
300009,kemper,2009-02-01 06:28:00,2232,"silicone spray, vaseline seems to work.  Ive used WD 40 with success too."
300029,Terry,2009-02-01 10:19:00,14456,get bigger guides
300140,steelhead hunter,2009-02-01 17:58:00,152,try stanley's ice off paste works better than silicone spray or aynthing else it's like 5.00 and lasts a long time
300163,bassmaster4,2009-02-01 19:36:00,801,where can i get it?
300165,ChrisK,2009-02-01 19:40:00,2772,On this link there is a dealer locater as well as a good right up on the product...... http://www.questoutdoors.net/gear/tested/s...-ice-off-paste/  Cheers !!
300188,kickingfrog,2009-02-01 20:58:00,8333,"We need Dawg to give us his secret, I don't ever remember him complaining 'bout his guides freezing up.  Agreed, bigger guides help. All I've ever used was WD40, but I want to give these other products a try."
300220,KelfuN,2009-02-01 22:07:00,246,"been using vaseline all season, no problem."
300439,kentooley,2009-02-02 12:38:00,208, The fly shop at BPS.
300447,Roy,2009-02-02 13:14:00,13728,"If your guides dressed more warmly, they wouldn't freeze up!  <a href=""http://s300.photobucket.com/albums/nn28/Bassigan/?action=view&current=IMG_0146.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i300.photobucket.com/albums/nn28/Bassigan/IMG_0146.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
300476,snag,2009-02-02 14:26:00,1932,Is that Scotch Guard Roy?
300587,bukee,2009-02-02 19:07:00,58,  Bassmaster4 I am pretty sure Peter's Tackle shop in St. Catharines carries that stuff.

300654,irishfield,2009-02-02 22:49:00,26272, LMAO !
300796,super dave,2009-02-03 02:37:00,323,"I've used vasaline or chapstick with good success.  Just apply the night before to let it soak in.  If applied just before going out, it doesn't work as well."
300821,douG,2009-02-03 03:49:00,2693,"Scotchguard, funny right there, Snag.  Coat the guides with some sorta heavy grease, like vaseline, or mink oil or something that will stop the water from wetting your gear.  No water, no ice."
300835,solopaddler,2009-02-03 04:08:00,8605," Dave, exactly how is something supposed to soak into a guide?  I've used just about everything including the ice off paste, they're all marginally effective. When it's cold enough nothing works."
300857,BigWilly,2009-02-03 04:46:00,9,I would have thought you'd want to be careful about adding sent to the line.
300864,waterwolf,2009-02-03 05:06:00,556," ever watch the  ""charlie whites' fishing show ?[a noted pro.]  he claims to catch more fish from the bilge juice than a scent-trail made from natural . the pioneer of underwater fish cameras ,, after all .       not that i'm a believer in that thinking ,but some may be."
300874,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-03 05:40:00,0,if you guys are getting all this ice in the guides it means you are reeling up your line to much and not jigging enough LOL!!!  never had a problem with the guides  the real problem is the buildup on the line that is a pain in the a**
300893,solopaddler,2009-02-03 10:23:00,8605, Or it could mean they're catching more fish.
300902,Guest skeeter99,2009-02-03 11:40:00,0,  good point and could be valid LOL!!!!   another solution would be by a portable and a mr heater buddy
301038,super dave,2009-02-03 21:25:00,323,"Mike,  Don't know the science of it, but it does seem to help applying the night before.  Especially for the line."
