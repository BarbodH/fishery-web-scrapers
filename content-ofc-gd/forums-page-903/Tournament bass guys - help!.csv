300699,steverowbotham,2009-02-03 00:17:00,1800," Limits are reduced due to many tournaments now having a ""co-angler limit""  10 fish in the box can be a lot, 6 or 8 isnt so bad.  I have a general distaste for those that find nothing better to do than be critical of everything around them and try to be funny about it... over 8000 times.  But I try to keep my mouth shut about it.  I'm done in this thread. I've said all I can say."
300402,BassAsin,2009-02-02 08:04:00,806,"in fact my face did not turn the slightest bit red while i read any of that. as a matter of fact my burning   did from feeling somewhat insulted to the fact that you compare all bass tourny fisherman to the select few   holes that do act that way i always make sure to have respect for anglers on the water when in a tournament and in everday life as a general rule it is just the way i was raised dont think that some of the ""new generation"" didnt get a good whip across the crack with a belt or a hand in that regard i have come across folks in ""my"" spot where i catch big bass and simply shoot them a friendly wave and smile and head to the next spot hoping they didnt just pull a big bass off that log and check it out later, i have been on a lake before fishing for nothing but pride and joy no money no prizes and had tourny guys fly by with a good distance between and a smile and wave and i can just imagine they're muttering to themselves that i just caught there big bass. regardless of how some individuals feel about the desire to compete in tournaments it is an obsession of mine and opinions of others are not goin to change that. i take much pride in doing as much as i can to help my fish stay lively and well, using the best tags for culling and handling by their bodies as little as possible. as for nets i use a rubber net removing as little slime as possible. what kind of net are you using that weighs only 15oz.? is it them rough green nylon light weight nets with the knots tied in it. becasue they're great it allows you to clean a fish and not have to scale it, the net already did it for ya! unless your using on of them butterfly nets, they should weigh in around a pound but then again who can trust their scale? how do ya get an accurate measure on your fish? lay them on the carpet of your boat or just hold em in the air and slide the tape out and get a quick read? and as for the fish losing weight out its rear end thats not a problem becasue with money on the line i make sure to stitch that up real good, sometimes even carry a seringe full of mercury makes them at least 3 oz. heavier each adding up for almost a total pound at the end of the day. but keep that quiet thats just a little trick i like to use! dont need all them other jack    to be doin that.  and the fact that we leave impressions for every other tourny fisherman is the same as fishin up here on the hardwater, if a guy comes and drills a hole 10 feet beside ya on a 500 acre lake make all icefisherman jerks? maybe its just the cold gettin to our heads? then again being the way i am i dont get my tampon all tied in a knot but rather chat with them and let it slide i dont own the lake and neither do they they're usually pretty deccent folks just lookin to meet a few similar interest folk on the water. this being said you can carry on to argue the fact that tournaments kill fish but so does driving a boat maybe ya'll should sell that motor and buy some really nice paddles with it. and dont think of gettin a trolling motor instead becasue you have to use a battery and keep it charged and that uses electricity and that kills fish too i imagine. so how about we all live in the dark, fish from shore with worms tied to the line yes the line not a hook, wouldnt wanna chance killing them.  Matt!"
300403,BassAsin,2009-02-02 08:11:00,806,"the last cull was a terrible idea bernie, it was'nt a tournament it was a tv show and many of the participants had no respect for themselves let alone others many of the entrants had hardly fished before in their lives i knew several of them, i vounteered my assistance for half a day on the show before realising that none of the overhead staff gave a crap about the sport or the fish simply making a show and a dollar i quickly realised this and stopped volunteering.   but i do realise where u are coming from although it is not simply the ignorance of a tournament angler but people in general."
300574,hirk,2009-02-02 18:17:00,571,"My 2 cents,cull tags in no way stress fish and ya the Berkley clips are the best,it does save from chasing them around a livewell.Glory bags have been shown to reduce stress because the fish feel more secure and they don't get sloshed around in the well when running or bang up against each other,they don't remove slime and fish can be tranfered,culled etc. without being touched."
300086,aniceguy,2009-02-01 14:50:00,1094,"the live release componant is a great concept, we run it on the craa tournament yearly and it has been very successful, as its bragging rights also with safeguards in place for cheating it hasnt been an issue.  Fishing for money is a different thing and as such sooner or later issues come up.  Flippin Jig hit it on the nail as did solo piercing a fishes mouth ( while it feels no pain ) it is stresed pulled from its enviroment, held by the gill plate and tossed in has no benefit at all to the fish. . . . .  Its how we educate ourselves, and others  and then treat that same fish in a manner to lower the negative impacts via proper conservation tactics  that counts. . .  or take up knitting . . .  Someone said it bass are farily hearty, they are in fact very plastic in thier ability to re cover from the impact of angling its the delicate ones such as salmonids that really have it tough. . .. . I sit on a council with Dr Casslemen and Im looking forward to his insite into C & R on Musky bottom line dont want to kill or hurt a fish sell the poles and take up golf because no matter how much you know or how hard you try some fish do in fact die"
300097,solopaddler,2009-02-01 15:12:00,8605," True, true, I get your point. We may as well all just join P eTA if not harming a fish in any way is the priority.  But there's a big difference between unhooking and releasing a fish quickly and efficiently at boatside and this (to quote Lew):  ""Their hooked, then the hooks are pulled back out, then their bounced around in a livewell all day with a bunch of other fish, in a boat going upwards of 60 MPH, then hauled back out and carried to the weigh station, then back to the water and released.......or whatever........""  Again I'm not in any way against the practice, but it simply cannot be argued that it's equally as harmless as normal C&R practices."
299838,nodie,2009-01-31 23:27:00,34,"Question for you bass guys.  Does the culling systems that goes into the bass's mouth really affect the fish? We all know it's critical to keep our bass top shape in the live well during tournament time, but will this affect the life longevity of that fish?  Thanks!  Nod"
299842,Greencoachdog,2009-01-31 23:31:00,8163,"I personally would say that the fish are better off without it.   ... but when you're fishing for money, it doesn't matter if you kill a fish or 27... does it?"
299844,sonny,2009-01-31 23:34:00,511,"It does not hurt the fish at all,,end of story!"
299859,aniceguy,2009-02-01 00:09:00,1094,it doesnt hurt the fish.  It makes removing them from the well easy as opposed to having a fish bonk its head on the corners as you stumble to grab it Its not the culling tags thats going to kill a fish but rather low O2 heat and poor care while in the live well
299884,misfish,2009-02-01 01:10:00,29133," Give this guy another RUM  If you want the healthiest fish, keep the live well pump going all the time.Only put it on recurculate when travelling.Fresh water like ang said, is most important."
299888,Greencoachdog,2009-02-01 01:19:00,8163,"    Oh sure!... what's a little gill and lip abrasion leading to infection gonna do?... but who really cares when there's prize money to be had!!!    Make it a double eh!!!  Yes, fresh water is a must... but limiting slime removal and abrasions is very important too!!!  Like I said... who cares if ya kill a few fish?.. as long as the prize money is there!!!"
299889,OhioFisherman,2009-02-01 01:20:00,6623,"Never used the tags always comfortable guessing, never scaled one in the boat if it was legal on the golden rule it went in the livewell, smallest one was kept on one side separate from the bigger ones. Never had one die in the livewell in a tournament."
299890,Greencoachdog,2009-02-01 01:22:00,8163,  That's the way you do it!!!  Are y'all Bass tourney boys writtin' this stuff down???
299892,BassAsin,2009-02-01 01:27:00,806,"so what we're saying here is ramming a 5/0 hook or 3 trebles into its mouth is ok but a cull tag is not appropriate?   i tag every one of mine 12 inch or 5 lb it gets a tag, was in a tourney last year wher i started with 5, 2-3 pounders and by the end of the day i was culling 4-5 pounders and ended the day with 5 over 5 in the well all within ounces.  i have never had a fish die in the well either with a tag in them!"
299895,misfish,2009-02-01 01:28:00,29133, And the last time you were at a weigh in was?????????????????  Do yer research on the shimano live release there dawg.
299896,BassAsin,2009-02-01 01:31:00,806,"FLW as well a success rate of over 95% live release and they use tags.    are they being ignorant? the weekend angler who catches and keeps all their bass are harder on the fish then us tourny guys, even when i fish bass on days or for fun i catch and release them. so am i still a ""bad guy"" for using tags?"
299899,misfish,2009-02-01 01:36:00,29133, Hey were on the same page here.LOL
299901,BassAsin,2009-02-01 01:38:00,806,we sure are! i was directing the second half of that at others!  it almost disgusts me when people keep their bass to eat i see them as a C&R fish only (personal opinion) have maybe kept a dozen in my life because they died or couldnt be revived
299907,Greencoachdog,2009-02-01 01:54:00,8163," The hook is momentary, the tag is not!!!  The abrasion and infection I'm talking about is not the thing that will kill a fish in the live well and you know it!!!  Can you say post release mortality???... sure!... I knew you could!    I don't do tourney's or weigh ins because I don't want to get caught up in the whole fishin' for money/obnoxious bass tourney fisherman thing   ... but think about it, what do you think that tourney angler cares more about?... that 14 inch Bass or that $50,000 purse?  It's elementary when you stop for just one second to think about it."
299912,bassjnkie,2009-02-01 01:59:00,1101,"I did some tourneys in the past. Not a pro at all. I always used my culling system and no it doesn't affect the fishes longevity, and the bonus is their easy to take out of the well. I talked to a lot of pros and they said bring a cooler of ice, so when the the live well water is warm, throw some ice in. That will cool down the water and help the bass from stress and eventually dieing.  Hope this will help and good luck.  Daniel"
299914,misfish,2009-02-01 02:01:00,29133," I for one have had 1 fish wieghed in dead. It bothered me. Sure theres money to be won,but when ya wiegh in a doa fish,it,s not the best feeling. So I fished say, pretty close to 50 tourneys and 1 doa fish.Pretty good odds to me. Oh and the one that did doa,it had a deep tube in it,s throut.I could of tossed it,but didnt."
299916,steverowbotham,2009-02-01 02:02:00,1800,"I tag every fish I put in the box, makes culling a much simpler process...  I've actually seen anglers put the clips through the fish's gills.... dont do that please.  Under the lip and you're fine"
299918,Greencoachdog,2009-02-01 02:04:00,8163,"Do y'all not understand post release mortality???  Keep fresh water running into the live well, and no tags... keep the smallest one to the side by itself, you'll feel much better about yourself knowing you did the best you could!"
299929,steverowbotham,2009-02-01 02:19:00,1800, Do you not understand that a clip on the lower lip of a fish is NOT going to lead to death
299931,Greencoachdog,2009-02-01 02:21:00,8163," ... and what about abrasion, slime removal, and infection???... but who really cares about that when there's purse money to be had eh!"
299933,misfish,2009-02-01 02:24:00,29133," Where are ya going with this dawg?   Nodie,you asked a very good question.  You will get some,very positive replies."
299935,Greencoachdog,2009-02-01 02:30:00,8163," Like I said in my very first post to this thread... the fish is better off without it!  The less you do to that fish, the better the chances are for his survival after his release!!!... y'all know that!  If I should stoop to doing the cull tag thing, I would consider myself lazy with minimal respect for the fish... but that's just me eh!"
299942,misfish,2009-02-01 02:37:00,29133,"OHHHHHHHHHHH Thats what yer saying.  Well,it has been proven that doing like Steve said,causes no harm to the fish."
299946,Terry,2009-02-01 02:44:00,14456,"studies show in water cooler then 85 deg. bass do very well above that heat stress and other problems like low oxygen and sure why not ""infection"" can happen  in Canada hot water temps really are not a problem, so we don't see those problems"
299948,Greencoachdog,2009-02-01 02:45:00,8163," Oh sure!!!  Y'all keep up with the fish that you release 2, 3, 4 weeks after you release them???  Who cares what happens to them after the release... just as long as they don't die in the live well and we get our prize money!!!   I know y'all are trying to justify what you do... but deep down inside you know it would be better for the fish not to cull tag it."
