So I figured I would share one or two with you, in hopes others will do the same and I can get some new content to read  If you have a personal blog all the better!!  http://thewvsr.com/  <-- Funny and entertaining. http://consumerist.com/ <-- Used to be a great blog! It still is but the format has changed somewhat... Very informative. http://www.speedtrap.org/ <-- Informative, and it gets very local all over North America! http://www.lifehacker.com/ <-- There Mission statement says it all ""Tips and downloads for getting things done""   Anyways here are a few of the sites I like to visit on a semi-regular basis... share yours with us wont you?
