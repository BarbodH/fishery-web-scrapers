300727,FUSION,2009-02-03 01:03:00,81," Wrong on all accounts???  So GMC/Chevy with there 403hp 6.2l V8 and Dodge with there 5.7l 391hp V8 don't have more hp than Tundra? GMC/Chevy offer 6.2l and 6.0l V8 and the 6speed tranny on allmost every Seirra/Silverado not just Denali. You can get 4:10 gears on allmost any 4x4 GMC/Chevy truck as well as Ford and Dodge. Was I wrong when I said Ford F150 has the best in class towing/hauling numbers at 11400lbs and also has a 6speed tranny? Was I wrong when I said Tundra has the weakest frame ""only un-boxed frame in the ht market"" of any half ton pick-up and has the smallest leaf springs? FYI your Tundra doesn't have a 4:30 rear end it has a 4:10 and that is only available on the Max heavy duty payload package not standard on all 5.7l Tundras and not available on 4.7l.  Your average Tundra 4.7l V8 276hp, 313fpt, 5speed. $35000 Your average F150 4.6l V8, 292hp, 320fpt, 6speed. $38000 Your average Sierra/Silverado 5.3l V8, 315hp, 338fpt, 5speed, 6 available. $38000 Your average Ram 4.7l V8, 302hp, 329fpt, 4speed tranny. $37000  Top of the line Tundra, 5.7l V8, 381hp, 400fpt, 6speed. $54000 Top of the line Sierra, 6.2l V8, 403hp, 410fpt, 6speed. $54000 Top of the line F150, 5.4l V8, 330hp, 390fpt, 6speed. $53000 Top of the line Ram, 5.7l V8, 391hp, 401fpt 5speed. $51000  To say Tundras not selling because its more expensive is not the case. Toyota was running 0% and big rebates just like everyone else was in 08 and there priced almost the same as the big 3.  F150 sales were over 400,000 for 2008. Sierra/Silverado sales were over 390,000 for 2008. Ram sales were 200,000 for 2008. Tundra sales were 115,000 for 2008.  The North American truck market bought 1.1 million half ton trucks in 2008 and only 115,000 of those were Tundras so again, please tell me indepth how Tundras changeing the game and all my facts were wrong???"

Oh, wait you couldn't watch them yesterday if you were tuned in for the Super Bowl because Bankrupt Motors couldn't afford to advertise during the Super Bowl, neither could Dodge.  Toyota had many adds during the game including some with TUNDRA.  Go to Consumer Reports and see who got the BEST REAL mileage from all the trucks they tested. It was the TUNDRA.  BTW I get 19.3 with my BIG V-8 engine and it's a 4x4 double cab. And it will also out pull and out last ANY of the once big three manufacture trucks.

It gets great fuel mileage and specs. say it can tow up to 2700lbs,  Which will be enough for when I get my first boat, and not too bad for a little 4-cyl.  I'm loving the handling it has due to the low center of gravity on the boxer engine.  Haven't been stuck with it yet, and I've driven it on some pretty hairy roads.    Since you mentioned some other smaller SUV's I will suggest you look into the new (think it started in '08) model Subaru Forresters.   They did away with the old boxy look and made them much more SUV like.  I was really tempted to buy one of these last summer but opted to go the used route instead.  Great looking vehicles, gas mileage was good from what I remember, and lots of space.   When I compared pricing of them compared to Honda CRV, Toyata, RAV 4, Ford Escape, Chevy Equinox and Hyundai Santa-FE, the forrest came back with the lowest price.  The standard all-time all wheel drive is pretty nice too."

The only reason I bought this vehicle was I needed the room of a mini van, and this was the only real choice when it came to towing capacity and rear wheel drive. Overall, I am not the least bit impressed with the thing to date! Outdated features and lots of little things have gone wrong with it. It is full of rattles and is drafty in any kind of winter weather. It has absolutely no place to put my size 12 boots due to the wheel humps taking up so much space. Ahhh well, what can you do?  I tow a 17 foot Bass boat and a larger 6 1/2' x 12' utility trailer loaded with fire wood.  I have a 2003 Toyota Rav 4 for getting to and from work. 60 km each way cost a small fortune in the van.

My old '98 GMC with the 5.7/350cu in engine in it has no more pulling power than this litte 4.6 V8 Thanks to the many ""gears"" of each 1/2/Drive in the transmission to keep the torque up to the rear wheels.
