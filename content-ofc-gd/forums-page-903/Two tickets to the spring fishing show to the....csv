300854,HTHM,2009-02-03 04:42:00,4082,Go on Monday
300950,rob v,2009-02-03 15:15:00,535,Seems some of the people here aren't the only ones that think the tank is 5000 gallons (?)   http://www.mississaugabassmasters.com/pdf_...mp;BoatShow.pdf
300951,irishfield,2009-02-03 15:20:00,26272,I was going by the announcement posted on OFC... that should be the bible.. LOL  A2F changed his answer 3 times... Nauti's was done without changes. Maybe they can go together if my answer is wrong ! lol
300958,rob v,2009-02-03 15:51:00,535,hey - I have no idea what the answer is - I just came across this thing today and noticed what they had posted on their flyer vs what I read here last night.  Enjoy the show !  )
300962,diggyj,2009-02-03 15:59:00,548,"I hope this show will be a good one. Don't want to sound negative, but still no exhibitor list on their site and no response from them after I sent an email asking them if they had a list. Bad service on their part. Having a pdf floorplan without exhibitors penciled in is kind of cheesy."
300963,irishfield,2009-02-03 15:59:00,26272,"45,000 gallons does seem a bit extreme Rob. I think my 20 x 42 full L pool only holds 30,000.. but TJ said I won!!! lol"
301085,rbaquial,2009-02-04 00:06:00,968,"well, the 1st time around I searched... and found a generic ""MEGA TANK""... and posted what they said how many gallons it has... then I realized, they can call any ""LARGE"" tank a ""MEGA"" tank... then I did a more SPECIFIC search... and found the same tank they used last year...at the FISHING SHOW (before it was closed)...."
301090,lunkerbasshunter,2009-02-04 00:14:00,2585,i am never around when the question gets ask lol seems like im always 2 hours behind  Cheers!
