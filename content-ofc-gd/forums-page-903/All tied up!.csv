297492,SlowPoke,2009-01-26 05:50:00,2984,"I didn't get a chance to go fishing Friday with Mike but I did get a chance to play with my tackle!  :whistle:  I wanted to start making tackle and one of the techniques I'd need to master would be dressing trebles. I took the plunge and bought a vice, shaved the neighbours cat and tried my hand at tying.  My initial attempts were suitable for backup trebles in the event I had to cut one off while fishing at night in very murky water for blind fish. Sunsequent efforts saw some improvement but I knew it was time to call on a team of experts.  I enrolled in a fly tying course at Jay's Fly Fishing in London. I was tipped off about Jay's when vise shopping and paid them a visit. Super nice crew at Jay's and I was looking forward to the tying course.  There were 5 or 6 students with varying degrees of experience and 2 instructors with lots of vise time under their belts. It was nice to be in a small 'class' and we moved along at a good pace.  Jay performing a magic trick.    Some of the graduating class    My first ever fly ""Woolly Bugger""    and then the ""Gold Ribbed Hares Ear""    followed by the ""Elk Hair Caddis"" (my favourite)    and then the ""Black Nose Dace""    and finally, the ""Usual""    I don't think I'll ever end up trying these flies but they were fun to learn. Once I got home with a few supplies, I decided to put my new techniques to work.      A lot yet to learn and many more hours of practice to come.  -Brian"
297495,GBW,2009-01-26 05:58:00,8460,Looks good to me Brian. Are the last 2 pic's something you are going to use on a jerkbait as the last hook?  it's hard to tell the size from the pic how big they are...
297497,SlowPoke,2009-01-26 06:05:00,2984," Thanks. The trebles are 1/0. I don't really have anything in mind for them yet, just practicing."
297500,SlowPoke,2009-01-26 06:52:00,2984,And here's one I really like! This was tied on one of GCD's hand made jigheads.  
297501,Dnthmn,2009-01-26 07:06:00,128,"Lookin' Good!!  Glad to hear you went to visit Jay & Stu for a lesson.  There is also the Forest City Fly Fishing Club.  During the winter they have a mentoring program and give free tying lessons to members then as spring approaches they turn to casting lessons and group outings.  Best part is that a few of the local shops, like Jay's, will give members a discount so you can basically get the membership fee back and then some depending on how much material you buy in a year.  http://www.fcfc.ca  If you ever want someone to tie with let me know."
297524,Greencoachdog,2009-01-26 12:01:00,8163,Those flies and trebles look great B!!!  That Wobble jig is amazing!!!  I've found that I'd almost rather do tackle craft than eat when I'm hungry!
297579,ccmtcanada,2009-01-26 14:26:00,7971,Looks great Brian!!  I don't have the patience to do any tying for myself...even tying roe bags is painstaking for me!!!  I have a feeling you'll be using plenty of these on the water next year...I'm sure they'll catch you a few fish too!
297592,ChrisK,2009-01-26 14:38:00,2772,Nice work Brian !! Now we just got to get you out fly fishing with those beauty patterns......
297609,Bly,2009-01-26 14:56:00,1556,Nice work Brian!    I have tried to purchase a few dressed replacements and have not seen any as nice as those.   Have fun and may they help you catch the big one or six
297648,shane,2009-01-26 16:17:00,652,"Nice job on your first flies  You Wooley-bugger looks as good as any professionally tied Wooley-bugger.  I started tying flies,not for actual fly-fishing, but on jig heads to make 'jig-flies'. (supposedly a 'Canadian' thing)   If you tie that Wooley-bugger onto on of GCD's jigheads, you'll have a great smallmouth bait.  Same with your 'usual'.  Except, I would add a marabou type tail to it.  A cheap (but very good) variation of Ian James' infamous 'White Puke' pattern."
297649,highdrifter,2009-01-26 16:21:00,2534,Time very well waisted!  That's a noice bugger for a first timer.  The proportions are purrrfect!!  Good luck on the water.  cheers HD
297663,msp,2009-01-26 16:56:00,1336,"Slow poke, Looks good to me. Tying flies is a great hobby. Once you find certain patterns that suit your style of fishing ,you will really perfect the art. Try not waisting time on patterns that dont work. Nothing beats the feeling of catching fish on a pattern that you tied, or better yet, a pattern that you created. Stick with it. You can only get better."
297667,LeXXington,2009-01-26 17:09:00,1928,"Looks great, the last 2 really would be great on some spinners for pike"
297668,kemper,2009-01-26 17:15:00,2232,"agreed, wicked flys   I remember being SUPER stoked the first time I hooked a steelie on one of my jig patters.  All I was thinking was NO WAY, I cant believe that actually worked!"
297695,SlowPoke,2009-01-26 18:22:00,2984,"Thanks for all the great comments! I'm really looking forward to trying some creations out this year... the flies might have to wait however.  I might take you up on that. Seeing it first hand made the learning process much easier than watching youtube videos.  I don't know about fly fishing but we'll have to hit the river this year for sure! I threw one together with that big boulder in mind - you know the one. Pink was the right colour but that biggun spit the Senko back at me. Maybe this jig will keep it on longer.    Wow, thanks! I thought about dressing a jig with hackle and marabou; I have some in my box with chenille and marabou and thought the hackle instead of chenille would look really cool! I'm glad to know it's effective. I'll try that once I stock up on more supplies. At this point all I have is synthetic hair, bucktails, angel hair and flash. Oh, and a pouch of malamute hair - used that on the pink jig for dubbing/bulk.  -Brian"
297696,jdmls,2009-01-26 18:22:00,575, LMAO cause I have been there with quite a few stupid ( and I emphasize the word stupid ) steelhead baits
299602,PERCHER,2009-01-31 00:55:00,787,Nice work Brian.What do think maybe some salmon trolling flies ?
299604,bigugli,2009-01-31 01:05:00,6138,They look good.  Nothing like catching fish on your own creations.
299614,misfish,2009-01-31 01:23:00,29133,"Nice work there Brian .   Making yer own and catching with,is so very overcoming.  When I started making my own version of the simcoe bug,and caught fish,it was so exciting.  It was like holly c rap man, they love it. You be surprised what colours work."
299643,Daplumma,2009-01-31 02:31:00,1961,"I was gonna say something sharp and mean and insult your masculinity for tying flies but,dude they look pretty good!Yer not gonna turn into a pinhead steel header are you?I mean a center pin steelheader..I think,or is that a flyrod elitest..I dunno.Maybe we are just fisherman.Looks good on ya bud. Joe"
299710,Spiel,2009-01-31 12:59:00,9065,"....They look as good as anything that falls out of my tying vise Brian, good job."
299879,fishindevil,2009-02-01 00:41:00,6254,"Looks great brian !!!   put a few of them trebles on your challenger bait for the bay of quinte man,im sure the walleyes will be quite willing to co-operate !!!! many guys swear by using dressed trebles on their crankbaits,well look at the rapala x-raps,they have dressed hooks and we all know that they work amazing !!!  cheers bud"
300621,SlowPoke,2009-02-02 21:20:00,2984,"That's the plan Stan. I bought a tube fly mandrel and I need a few more supplies before I 'tackle' the procedure!   Lay it on me Joe, I have big padded shoulders, I can take it!   I hadn't thought about the Challengers until you mentioned it but in thinking it through... I wonder if the dressed treble would slow down the action of the bait. Added drag on the treble straightening out the body?  Thanks again for the kind remarks! Some more pic's...  I love this one!     Too much thread             This one was a blast to make. It was my Daughters design and she stood over my shoulder wringing her hands in anticipation. She's such a cutie!   And a few trebles...        I'm having a blast with this!!! I can't wait to start tying feathers. -Brian"
