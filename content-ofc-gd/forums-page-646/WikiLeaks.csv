This site basically ensures anonymity for people who supply leaked documents or other classified information.  Everything on the site is available to the general population... Do a search for articles related to Canada for some interesting reads.  There are hundreds of leaked documents from the war in the Middle East.  Interview with the editor-in-chief, Julian Assange:  TED Conference Interview about WikiLeaks  Like it or not, this just shows how easy it is for information to be leaked through the internet.  This site streamlines that information into a single, user friendly site.  I have mixed feelings about it.  On one hand, the public now has access to many ""covered up"" reports from governments all over the world.  On the other, wrong-doers have access to leaked plane blueprints and other sensitive security related documents."

The doctors reported significantly higher levels of cancers than those reported following Hiroshima.  Not exactly conclusive evidence that US attacks influenced those cancers, but fascinating none the less.  Just shows the importance of an outlet for Public Information like WikiLeaks.  Although I abolsutely HATE Fox News, I respect this guy's opinion of WikiLeaks:  Judge Andrew Napolitano on Wikileaks."

WikiLeaks is phenomenal, the governments defn' deserve all their laundry being aired out for the public ..."
