492680,Grimace,2010-08-08 23:14:00,2020,"Pretty much explains itself.  I was more than a little bit surprised by who it was.  Too many trout Posted By Intelligencer Staff Posted 13 days ago   Over-fishing has landed a Picton-area man a hefty series of fines.  Kevin Lavers has been fined a total of $5,500 after pleading guilty to several fishing offences in a Bracebridge court.  Justice of the Peace Dennis D. White heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice June 17.  The court heard Lavers had been fishing on Lake of bays, near Dorset, May 6 and 7. Joint investigation by a Ministry of Natural Resources officer and the OPP found that Lavers caught and kept six lake trout on both days. This exceeds a sportfishing license, which allows a fisherman to catch and keep two lake trout per day. The limit for possession of lake trout is also two. During the investigation, the ministry says, Lavers asked another party to hide the fish he caught.  The ministry reminds anglers to review the 2010 Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary — available through ServiceOntario/Government Information Centres, license issuers and ontario.ca/fishing — to confirm the number of fish they can catch and keep under their particular license.  To report a natural resources violation, call 1-877-847-7667 or contact your local ministry officer.

Kevin Lavers had been fishing near Dorset on May 6th when he was fined for catching and keeping 6 lake trout. The legal limit is two per day. The next day, Lavers was caught and fined for the same offence.   I read .."" A B.C man"" I think tourist?   Not fair to the one that was assumed if this is a case of mistaken identity!!!???"

Kevin Lavers of Picton had been fishing in Lake of Bays near Dorset on May 6, when he was fined for catching and keeping 6 lake trout. The legal limit is two per day. The next day, Lavers was caught and fined for the same offence. Lavers pleaded guilty and was fined over $5,000.  News media like the whig, intellegincer can not assume.  They are not allowed.  There is no Picton in British Columbia.  This is certainly strange."
492816,Dave Bailey,2010-08-09 12:53:00,1641, Could it be some inexperienced twit confusing Picton Ontario with notorious serial killer Robert Pickton? I'll bet the subtle association just took over without conscious thought.
492819,duber,2010-08-09 13:02:00,220,I live in the Picton area and can tell you it is the one you don't want it to be.
