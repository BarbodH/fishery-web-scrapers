I have heard its down close to 7ft, but looking for some verification.  If it really is down 7ft, it must look like a whole new area."
493488,cynmar,2010-08-11 12:08:00,169,"We stayed at Bryer Lodge the beginning of July, and the water was significantly down. I would say at least 5 feet. There were shoals out in the North Channel that I fished last year for small mouth that were under 4 ft of water and are now 1 ft under water or above the waterline. Careful when you are running as some of the new shoals aren't marked. By the way, during my week the fishing was TOUGH.  Bill"
493490,stubbex1,2010-08-11 12:13:00,164,i heard it was down half a metre.  Hopefully its not down 7 feet!  I'm heading up to moonlight bay on the north channel on sat
493497,Cosmos,2010-08-11 12:32:00,588,"Hi, My friend came back yesterday from Wolsley Bay area. Water level is down again. Fishing was really bad. They got 2 pikes and 1 walley for 3 days of fishing."
493545,Rich Clemens,2010-08-11 14:56:00,3131,"I heard from Rainbow Camp, where I'll be in September.   At that time, they were down about 3 feet. Rainbow Camp is on the North Channel - just on the other side of Wolseley Bay. I'm scheduled to be at Wolseley Lodge on Sept. 4   Launching may be interesting there."
493548,stubbex1,2010-08-11 15:04:00,164,i also wonder if they mean 3 feet lower than last year or three feet lower than long term levels.  Here's an interesting website i usually look at before i go up as water levels going up/down can really affect the bite.   http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ontario/eaux-water/renseignement-information-eng.html  
493561,esoxcrazy,2010-08-11 15:48:00,22,levels are probably down 3 feet from precious years average and close to 5 feet from last year. the bite is really picking up as most of our guest are hitting walleye through the day in this heat. Some big pike boats yesterday as well in horseshoe bay.
