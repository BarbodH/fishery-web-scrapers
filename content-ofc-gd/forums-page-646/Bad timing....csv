What are the chances that Shimano would have a 7' one piece, medium power, extra fast action spinning rod (CPS-X70MB)at their Peterborough repair depot? We can stop by tomorrow on our way out with only a minor detour. This has become my favourite rig for drop-shotting, tubing and worming. I guess it's worth a phone call before we leave to see if they have one in stock."
492462,lew,2010-08-08 12:52:00,12766,Their great guys to deal with Jer and if they've got one in stock you'll be on your way in a couple minutes.
492464,Roy,2010-08-08 12:54:00,13728,"Yeah, call them first. How did it snap? I have 4 of them (not in that flavour)....they're decent rods."
492480,Jer,2010-08-08 13:35:00,1426,"I've replaced rods with them in the past, just not for several years, and not since Bud moved from his own store on the Queensway. He carried lots of stock back then, would even upgrade a warrantied rod if he didn't have the same one. The new location seems to carry more bicycle stuff than fishing gear. Either way I have no worries about them replacing the rod, would just like to have it for our trip.  Roy, I was pulling a snag free and rapped the tip against the boat. My next cast, the tip snapped."

492866,lew,2010-08-09 14:31:00,12766,"That's too bad Jer, but as you said above, perhaps they don't carry as big an inventory now as they did in the old place."
