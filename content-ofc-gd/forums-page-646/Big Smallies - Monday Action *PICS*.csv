By 2:00pm when I finished Season 5, I decided it was too nice of a day.  Tidied up around the house so as not to be murdered in my sleep, then picked up my dad and we were off to the lake in search of some big smallies!  We made a long run to my spot from last week and got into a bunch of fish in the 2-3 pound range.  Fun, but not what we were after.  Swamped the front of the boat twice heading across the lake to another good zone, the wind picked up pretty good.  Glad we did!  Pulled up to my waypoint in 30 feet of water and first cast with a dropshot, my bait was in the water maybe 3 seconds and it bolted sideways with a 4 pounder on the other end of it.  Tangled with about 15 more in the 3.5-5 pound range even after the wind died down and the sun started to go down the fish were biting good.  Great day on the water with my old man, we made some memories today with 3 double headers to top it off!  Thanks for reading!        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlHHAZIlhkE"

488815,steverowbotham,2010-07-27 14:06:00,1800, Legend XCalibur 179 with a 75HP Mercury 4 Stroke.  She's no speed demon but handles Simcoe's rollers better than any bass boat I've had out there.
488818,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-27 14:12:00,0," Thanks. I was looking at those boats. I thinks it's $20,000 out the door brand new."

488828,Toddyc20,2010-07-27 14:27:00,141,Amazing looking fish.  I work in the barrie are and let me just throw it out there that if you are ever looking for a fishing partner for a day of smallie fishing drop me a line.  I've never caught a simcoe smallie just a bunch of largemouth.
488829,Aaron Shirley,2010-07-27 14:27:00,655,Those are some great smallies! Spending the evening with your dad pounding bronze even better.
