492780,Stern Rules,2010-08-09 04:31:00,342,"On CH news tonight was a story of a woman in Fort Erie who thinks she caught a snakefish. She didn't know what it was at first but she did eat it. She said it wasn't bad. It showed the carcass and it definately looked like a snakefish. If they're here, that's not good. Did anyone else see the clip?"
492784,knightfisher,2010-08-09 05:23:00,237,"Looks like a Bowfin to me, caught many of them."
492820,MJL,2010-08-09 13:05:00,2427,CTV also has a news segment on it as well  http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100808/northern-snakehead-ontario-100808/20100808/?hub=TorontoNewHome  It's hard to tell by just looking at the head.  It's much easier to differentiate a snakehead and a bowfin by looking at its anal fin (or possibly whatever's left of it after the meal   ).
492838,Michael_Brown,2010-08-09 13:37:00,411,I love that she didn't know what it was but still ate the fish.  Good thing it wasn't a coelacanth.
492840,tb4me,2010-08-09 13:40:00,3295,lovely snake heads and giant carp. Looks like we should get our kids out for some perch and walleye dinners while thier still here.
492851,frozen-fire,2010-08-09 13:56:00,542,"I am almost certain that it is an Amia calva (Bowfin). If that picture in the article MJL posted is of the actual fish, it is not a Channa argus (Northern Snakehead).  You can tell because of the difference in the head structure. Mainly the maxillary bone. Colour is not a reliable way to differentiate them, but it backs up the case. Northern snakeheads have a blotchy patterning and generally darker. Whereas the pic of the head shows standard bowfin colouring."
492852,Joey,2010-08-09 14:01:00,9122," I know eh, that made me laugh!!"
492853,uglyfish,2010-08-09 14:02:00,981,"looks like a bowfin. if i recall, snakeheads have a flatter head, and more predominate teeth. and are a much darker color as well arent they?"
492917,perchslayer666,2010-08-09 16:20:00,280,"If there's one invasive specie to come into our waters, I hope this one flourishes. I've never caught one, but I heard that these things absolutely crush lures, fight like a smallies on steriods (circa 1978) and are freaking delicious. These things make muskies look like a pussy cat, I'd love to be able to fish for something that a 'muskie' guy has nightmares about. I say bring em on!!!!"
492925,Mike Pike,2010-08-09 16:41:00,1332,"If it IS just a bowfin like many have commented, it's another example of the media not letting the truth get in the way of good story."
492937,saneryin,2010-08-09 17:09:00,39,"to me, it looks like a bowfin.  the snakehead is very pouplar (and delicious) in China market. many people breed them in fish farms or ponds.  snakehead is the only 'game' (predator) fish in China.  (Pike is another one, but limited only in up - north west lakes, Xinjiang province)  The most popular fish people catching are carps, bighead carps, xxx carps... have to wait for them to come over to bite.  people living near the sea are some other fishing stories.  "
492951,Billy Bob,2010-08-09 17:32:00,5865,I just watched the clip that says its NOT a snake head but rather a bow fin....but what puzzles me is that Amy Merry says she was CONCERNED that it was a snake head but she first ate it and then called the authorities...
492955,Stern Rules,2010-08-09 17:42:00,342,I agree with that.
492971,Joey,2010-08-09 18:32:00,9122, Well she got her 15 minutes didn't she
492993,splashhopper,2010-08-09 19:31:00,2931,"Update from Toronto Star   Fabiola Carletti and Wendy Gillis Staff Reporters   Good news for the creatures of the Welland Canal — there’s no “Frankenfish” threatening to destroy the ecosystem.  Reports that a Northern Snakehead fish — a dreaded and destructive invasive species with no natural predators in Canadian waters — was caught over the weekend are false.  Angler Amy Merry told reporters that a fish jumped out of the water and onto the shore while she was fishing near Fort Erie. It was initially believed to be a snakehead —an aggressive species known for its ability to slither across land and live outside water for days.  But research scientist Becky Cudmore, a specialist in aquatic and invasive species with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, examined photos of the fish and determined it is actually a bowfin fish — a native species in the canal.  Snakehead fish are native to eastern Asia, are “voracious” predators that quickly grow to adult lengths of 1.5 metres or more, according to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).  The snakehead was nicknamed the “Frankenfish” by the U.S. media, and is still seen as a potential threat to the Great Lakes ecosystems."
493004,Billy Bob,2010-08-09 19:57:00,5865, That is EXACTLY what I was thinking.
493008,fishermccann,2010-08-09 20:00:00,655,"Saw the clip , only the head left, but sure looked like a Bowfin to me!"
493060,BillsTheBassMan,2010-08-09 21:54:00,932,You really have to wonder about someone who just eats something without having any idea of what it is . . . . I guess this is where Charles Darwin would chime in
493078,Musky or Specks,2010-08-09 22:24:00,2710,This is just about the most idiotic post of all time.
493088,thefireman,2010-08-09 22:46:00,51,I just checked youtube about the snake fish! Pretty crazy little buggers! I wouldn't want them anywhere near my water! Check it out
493099,aplumma,2010-08-09 23:02:00,6896,I don't wish Snakeheads on any ones waterways... but if they get their they are a blast to fish for. It has become my fish of choice when the Catfish are spawning or I want to fish artificial lures. I will still come up North to fish for Pike and Musky but it is a lot easier between trips now that we have a fish with teeth to entertain us. Yea the invasive species argument this is not the direction to take this post it is irrelevant they are established here their is no going back.  Art
493113,salmon,2010-08-09 23:45:00,334,Does not look like a snakehead to me.  I found this picture of a snakehead  
493118,MJL,2010-08-09 23:55:00,2427,If there's one thing we learned out of all of this...  ...Bowfin are tasty
493177,Stern Rules,2010-08-10 04:56:00,342,Exactly.
493246,fishboy,2010-08-10 15:14:00,550,"  today's Spec ran the same story...I'm with those who are wondering who the hell eats a fish that they found on the shore, nevermind not even knowing what it is!"
