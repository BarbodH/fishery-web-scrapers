492879,Toddyc20,2010-08-09 14:52:00,141,I've been hearing all of these reports about how hard the fishing is on Nipissing this year and it has me wondering if I'm going to fun into the same problems on Nosbonsing this week.  Anyone on hear fished Nosbonsing this summer?  Water levels as outrageous as Nip?
492919,kickingfrog,2010-08-09 16:22:00,8333,"Nosbonsing isn't drawn down in the fall the way Nipissing is. So while I would expect it to be lower than ""normal"", due to the lack of snow etc., I don't think it would be down more than a few inches.  Having said that, I haven't been there this year.... so??????  BTW my fishing this year was the best I've ever had on Nipissing, and I grew up there."
492920,Guest JPCT,2010-08-09 16:22:00,0,"We fished Nosbonsing the July 11th weekend and the water level was fine there.  Hammered tons of pike on topwater. Also had a bunch of musky follows on large bucktails.  Every day we would drive to Nos for 4:30am, fish topwater pike till 8:00 then hit up Nip for smallmouth"
492926,Toddyc20,2010-08-09 16:41:00,141,Thanks for the responses.  Does anyone know if there is a boat launch in Bonfield?  If not where is there a public boat launch?  I wasn't planning on bringing my muskie gear but if they were active in July I might as well give it a shot.
493081,Guest JPCT,2010-08-09 22:33:00,0, There is a launch there. I found directions on google but we ended up launching from Astorville.  And its free.
493162,Nipfisher,2010-08-10 02:59:00,2449,The launchg is downtown Bonfield. There are a few signs. Close to Sampson's SkiDoo dealership and Yogi's Snack bar.
493167,Toddyc20,2010-08-10 03:31:00,141, Which one is free?  The Bonfield or the Astorville one?
493178,Guest JPCT,2010-08-10 05:07:00,0," Astorville is free.  I'm not sure if Bonfield is.  For musky, Try and find out where the Sunken island is... We thought we found it.. then we couldnt find it the next day.  And 3 different people told us 3 different places .. lol.  If you go straight out from Astorville launch, through the narrows, youll come up to one of the best spots on the lake for Pike  shhhh  Let me know how it goes"
493222,Toddyc20,2010-08-10 13:06:00,141,We are going to be staying closer to Bonfield.  Does anyone know where the boat launch is in Bonfield and if it's free or not?  I'll have to try out the places you mentioned JPCT.  Thanks again for your help.
493252,Nipfisher,2010-08-10 15:40:00,2449,Yep. The Bonfield launch is free.
