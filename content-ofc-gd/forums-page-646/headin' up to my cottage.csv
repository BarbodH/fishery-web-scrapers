I've only been up there a 3 times so far this year, been wheelin' smaller pike and musky(10"" - 24"") and defn' some nice bass, alot of those bad boys, still have yet to catch any walleye out of there ...  just curious if anyone has experience with the lake, I'll be taking the new boat, so the fish finder, and the down riggers might help quite a bit on the fish catching front ...  If anyone has any ""spots"" you wouldn't mind sharing, feel free to shoot me a PM  ...  hopefully I'll have a decent report when I get back!!   wish me luck!"
