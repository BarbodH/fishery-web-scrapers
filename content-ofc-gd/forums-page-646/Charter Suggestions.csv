I fish Erie quite a bit for smallmouth and would like to go after some walleye.  Also, I'm hoping to go up to the Kawarthas for some muskie.  I'm leaning towards Pigeon Lake and was wondering if you have any suggestion for guides there.  Any help would be appreciated."

492722,PERCHER,2010-08-09 01:10:00,787,The best guy for walleye on Erie is Steve at Fishmasters located in Dunville.  http://www.fishmastersultimatecharters.com/  Steve is one of the best Erie walleye guys or Lake Ontario salmon guys.

492887,jayess,2010-08-09 15:13:00,187,I'd throw my bid in for Jimmy Riggin'. A good guy and knows where the fish are.  http://jimmyriggin.com/  Good luck!
492888,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-09 15:21:00,0,For pickerel? Hands down Fishmaster. For smallies? I'd say Paul Castellano. And from what I hear the most reasonably priced.  http://www.castadventures.ca
