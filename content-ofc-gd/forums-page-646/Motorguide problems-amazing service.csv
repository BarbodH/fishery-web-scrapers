I bought a Wireless55 in May last year and MG has a 3 year warranty, but I never registered the motor for warranty.  Sure enough the tranny went on it and I feared the worst. Living in Ottawa I took it to a local MG service depot and was promptly told it wasn""t in the system and was going to hit me for $285.00 + tax  When I explained the purchase date I was told to go register it online, so mess occurs and I can't register online due to ""ERROR"" please call Motorguide.  So I call Brian at Backwater tackle and start to explain my issues, he takes all my info, offers to call the factory registration personally and will call me back.  Less that 5 min later I get a call from Brian and he says the error was that the motor was listed as returned and reshipped(not exactly what that meant) but he then asks the purchase date and again informs me he will call back.  3 min later he returns the call to inform me the registration is good and my MG is under warranty until may20,2012.  My next call is to the service station , they were able to confirm the paperwork and I can pick up my MG tomorrow afternoon....cost....$0   Thanks Brian...you rock  Man if only everthing was that easy"

493337,MSBruno,2010-08-10 21:31:00,369, Brian seems like a stand up guy.  Seen him help a few online folks!
493370,Ron,2010-08-10 23:45:00,1683,Great to hear Matt.  Nothing worse than having a motor not functioning. There is no Motor guide repair shops around my area. The closest shop for any trolling motor (Minn Kota) in my area is Oshawa.
