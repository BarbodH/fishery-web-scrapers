Dead flat water this morning... we've had a bit of a cold front come through this week and the fish weren't near as active as they usually are on the surface...   Caught a wack of these... Kept my brother busy who's new to fishing....   And some of these...   The old man had a tough morning but managed a few of these little pip-squeeks...     And I rounded off the morning with a couple of better fish - but not the 5lb'ers we were looking for...     A funny point, my brother casted over a tree branch and while he was trying to get his line off a little largie smashed his senko!   Hope you guys enjoy the rest of your long weekend!  Cheers, Ryan"

490298,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-01 15:21:00,0,Great report. Those rockbass can be vicious feeders! At least your bro likes to fish. Mine just likes to drive around in the boat!
