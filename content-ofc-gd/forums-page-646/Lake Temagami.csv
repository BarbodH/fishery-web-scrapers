493006,John the Fisherman,2010-08-09 20:00:00,45,"Mainland is crown land, so no fee unless from outside Ontario.  Temagami has many designated camp sites throughout the lake.  Be sure you don't end up camping on the backside of a cottagers island.  Good swimming sites are also readily available."
493083,Musky or Specks,2010-08-09 22:37:00,2710,I'd much rather go down Red Squirrel Rd and hit some of the other lakes along the Anima-Nipissing River. I'm assuming no boat. Lots of camping along the road. Watch out for bears.
493115,Joey,2010-08-09 23:51:00,9122,"Absolutely tons of free camping on that lake.  Wayne showed me the tour and I was amazed at all the nice, free crown land camping there was.  Nice, cheap holiday if you ask me.  Joey"
