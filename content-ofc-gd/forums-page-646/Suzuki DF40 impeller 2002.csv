As far as I can see, other than the obvious bolts for the lower unit, there's a nut for the shift linkage that is accessable once you shift into reverse.  Any insight would be great as I'd like to change the thing as some preventative maintenance."
493293,DanD,2010-08-10 19:30:00,2223,Can’t help you with your question; but I still have a spare prop from when I had an 88 Suzuki        model # DT40CRLJ. Can’t remember whether it was new or reconditioned when I bought it; but it has never been in the water since I did. After reading your post; I went and dusted it off from sitting on a shelf here at the shop for the last 6 years. It’s ½ x 13 three blade and if it’ll work on yours’ (bushing spine and depth?) you can have it for the cost of a bottle (26er unless you're thirsty) rye. With a bit of googling (Is there such a word? LOL) you should be able to find out if it’ll fit?  Dan.
