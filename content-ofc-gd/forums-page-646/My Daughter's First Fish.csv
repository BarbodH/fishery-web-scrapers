492904,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-08-09 15:59:00,0,Congrats! I remember fishing grenadier pond when I was younger. When you run out of worms? Try cutting up the bait fish in little chunks. And set up a drop shot type rig with a few hooks. You'll be surprised with the results. Only place I ever tried this and this Portuguese guy showed me.

492936,bushart,2010-08-09 17:08:00,2628,Really cool----Usually a kids 1st fish is some out of season monster that you hunt for a lifetime.  Right on.
493119,Douger,2010-08-09 23:55:00,116,Thanks for the replies everyone.  I was definitely as excited as her when the float went down.  It'll be a good alternative this fall on the days the rivers are blown.  I'll just head down decked out in all my steelhead gear.
