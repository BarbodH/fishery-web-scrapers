257333,ehg,2008-10-10 17:26:00,2666,Found this board weeks after this happened. Was moved and still think of it to this day. Had a child just born shortly after that. So reading about it was very significant to me. Your ability to forge on through this unimaginable tragedy makes you still a hero to this day. Godspeed
257347,Rich Clemens,2008-10-10 18:09:00,3131,"Geez Garrett.  Didn't know that and can't imagine what that would was like.   One thing about this place, and it's members.  When the chips are down for someone, many others rise above ... well and beyond."
257350,Joey,2008-10-10 18:14:00,9122,"Gerritt, my heart goes out to you.  I remember we joined the site just after that happened and Jil101 (Joyce) told us of how everyone pulled together for you and I just knew at that point OFC was the kind of community I wanted to be a part of.  Remember him fondly and my thoughts are with you today my friend.  Joey"
257357,danbo,2008-10-10 18:42:00,2646,"God Bless Y'all, sincerely Dan Reid"
257386,douG,2008-10-10 19:45:00,2693,"God Bless you and your family, Gerritt.  Thanks for reminding us who we are, and why we carry on.  Doug"
257391,Gerritt,2008-10-10 20:06:00,6129,"I just wanted to say thank you to everyone... The reason I posted this is to remind everyone just how important OFC is to myself and so many others... I also wanted to let newer members know that the C in OFC really does mean community. While I am accepting of what has happened in my life up until now... it does not mean life is fair.  I did not post this looking for sympathy, But rather to remind everyone just how important it is to keep the ones you love close to you, and to remind those close to me (Many OFC members) Exactly why we are still here... Sure we bicker, sure we disagree... but in the end what we have in common is what binds us and makes us the ""family"" we are today..  I firmly believe people are built upon their experiances in life.. while many of us have taken kicks in the teeth in life... we are stronger people because of the experience.  I just wanted to personally thank you all for the past support, now... to get my ""OFNC4Life"" tattoo.  G"
257394,Terry,2008-10-10 20:30:00,14456,I remember that day  and thinking of it still puts a lump in my throat........  it's a parents worst nightmare....  my thoughts are with you  and your family
257397,ChrisK,2008-10-10 20:37:00,2772,I wasn't around then Gerrit but all the same I can feel your pain..... Life doesn't always smell of roses and the big picture isn't always what we would like for it to be but we do endure and move forward in hope of greener pastures. Thats what life is... I never had the chance to give you my condolences on the passing on your child so please consider this my opportunity....  Chris
257403,danc,2008-10-10 21:05:00,4677,"Hard to believe that it's been 6 years already Gerritt. Wow. I remember that day vividly as well. I know exactly what job that I was on that day, only because I couldn't get the thought of what your family went through, out of my mind that day. You are a very strong and compassionate man Gerritt. And thank you for being there for Sis and I when we needed it. It meant the world to us."

257444,SHAD,2008-10-11 00:36:00,134,"God bless man, my daughter is almost 2, can't imagine your family's pain. Everything happens for a reason but having your child leave this place before you, wow, that is too much.  Stay strong, though we may have only briefly met, you are a good dude that I know.  We're both from the hammer, pm me whenever ya need a beer or fishing partner dude!"
257449,pigeonfisher,2008-10-11 00:54:00,696,"It was a day and a time that showed what many can do for the aid of one, and his family.  I can remember a number of people that have been helped by the public and more importantly the private help of our membership.  I pray that on this day you can be strong, that all of our families are well and our thoughts can be positive."
257452,Clampet,2008-10-11 01:10:00,1947,"A sad story told by a guy I had the pleasure and honor to meet personally. Although I do not know you closely, I can tell by your posts and heartfelt honesty that you are a very very special person better than most men, Gerritt. The OFC board is very fortunate to have you as member."
257467,ctdd2006,2008-10-11 02:47:00,531,"Wow!  I am a new member, and proud daddy!   Your strength is admirable.  Please know I've been thinking of you and yours since reading this post and ran home to hug and kiss my 2 and a half year old.  That plate of food he through across the kitchen today seemed like so little.  Thanks and sorry at the same time!  God bless!"
257485,Rattletrap2,2008-10-11 04:01:00,1652,"Gerritt, I remember that day all too well. It is hard to believe that it has been six years already. I was absolutely floored to read your post that evening when I got home from work. I recall meeting You and Spiel at the funeral and recall how painful that time was for you. I can't imagine going through anything like that myself. Little Terence is in my thoughts quite often. Take care. Brian"
257535,Sis,2008-10-11 15:39:00,24,"Gerritt, I too remember that day vividly.  Waking up and reading the message you'd left me literally floored me.  The tears and the heartbreak were instant for you and Becky.  I also remember seeing Terry via webcam the day before, laying on the couch because he wasn't feeling well.  I also remember how the members of this board pulled together and how it was Spiel who offered to have funds sent to his address for those who wanted to help with the funeral costs.  Like many have said before me, I believe that is when OFC became a true family.  I don't post on here as often as I should, but seeing your post reminded me of what a wonderful place this is and I'll try to get busier on it. In Dans' reply, he mentioned how you and Becky were there for me when I was diagnosed last year with the big C word.  When you called, it really did mean a lot and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for being there. Friends til the end Sis"
257536,Radnine,2008-10-11 15:54:00,1538,"I am having a hard time trying to think of something to say after reading your post (the tears being only part of the problem). My most sincere and deepest sympathy is yours and if you were within hugging distance it would take me along time to let go. Warmest regards, Jim"
257539,Sinker,2008-10-11 16:12:00,8692,"WOW......Gerritt, I had no idea!!  Your in our thoughts and prayers!!  Sinker"
257731,Gerritt,2008-10-12 12:22:00,6129,  Nice to see you back and posting Sis.. dont be a stranger! Expect a PM from me.  G
257747,Spiel,2008-10-12 13:26:00,9065,".....Oh I remember the day very well. I also remember meeting Gerritt and his wife for the first time at the funeral home with an amazing amount of mail the good members off this board sent to me so that I may be the messenger. For that I'll be forever grateful as it has allowed me to get to to know Gerritt well and allow me the opportunity to call him ""friend"". God bless you all."
257193,Gerritt,2008-10-10 11:19:00,6129,"Six years ago today I was on the receiving end of OFC's generosity.. I was 26 and was just starting out.. That is when tragedy struck..  My 2 year old son because ill and died within 24 hours.. The cause of death was determined to be E. Coli Exactly where it came from still remains a mystery...  Being young (and broke) I was completely unprepared for something of this magnitude to have happen to us...It was then a good friend (Spiel)  stepped up to help a young family out, OFC'rs from all over North America sent him what they could afford and ultimately allowed us to be able to afford to bury our precious child...   Hard to believe it has been 6 years.. it seems like only yesterday I was holding, hugging and being a father to him.  He is burned into my mind and is thought about multiple time daily, most of the time with a smile now... but sometimes in sorrow too... especially when I see Liams accomplishments.  To everyone on OFC I personally thank you for helping a young family when they needed support the most.  Give your kids extra hugs and kisses today, spend some time fishing or playing catch... because nothing in this life is promised or guaranteed.  Humbly,  Gerritt."
257204,steve_paul,2008-10-10 11:32:00,658,"G, hang in there today and relive all the wonderful, albeit far far too short, times you had with him.  Thanks too for the reminder that life is far too short and far to precious to waste."
257207,lew,2008-10-10 11:40:00,12767,"I remember that sad day very well Bud, and it was indeed touching to see how the members of this wonderful board came together to stand with you and your family and offer you any support we could.  I think it was perhaps the 1st time OFC actually came together as one to help out one of our own members and it's a tradition that's come to be the norm around here now.  Gerritt, you were also one of the 1st members to offer me support when I faced a similar tragedy only a couple years later and I'll always remember that too."
257209,JEREMY,2008-10-10 11:47:00,300,"I was not around then ,but take today and remember all the good times."
257214,workwear,2008-10-10 12:04:00,592,"HE ONLY TAKES THE BEST  Many times we've missed you, A million times we've cried. If love could have saved you, You never would have died. It breaks our hearts to lose you, But you did not go alone. For a part of us went with you The day God called you home. We did not see you suffer, There was no cure to be. He closed his arms around you, And whispered come to me. For all that you went through, He saw you needed rest. God's garden must be beautiful, for He only picks the Best.   i wish i couldve written this  peter"
257215,Roy,2008-10-10 12:06:00,13728,I have that very first pic of Terry still burned in my mind. Good day to you my friend.
257224,Headhunter,2008-10-10 12:28:00,5703,I hope that smile you have stays today G. Stay strong and know there are many here for you. HH
257228,holdfast,2008-10-10 12:35:00,1813,"As a father of three Daughters and now a Grandson Tuesday, You can never know how much worried of their Health and Well Being especially when I was alone and far from home.  Gerritt I really feel for you going through a parents worst Nightmare.  One last thing, I admire your strength to go through that."
257232,solopaddler,2008-10-10 12:53:00,8605,"Yes, you must have incredible strength. It's amazing actually.  All the best, hope your day goes well."
257234,John,2008-10-10 13:02:00,2956,"Gerritt, your tragedy was just prior to my joining OFC. I can not even imagine what you went through. Cherish the memories and those precious 2 years.  Be well my friend.   J..."

257241,wuchikubo,2008-10-10 13:18:00,1114,"G., it was before my joining as well, but I'm saddened by knowing this and hope that you and your family has strength on this day. Also wishing you and your family great memories.  Personally, I don't think I would have your strength to get through it all.  Stan"
257244,Wild,2008-10-10 13:26:00,704,I am happy to read that you are able to smile in remembrance and pride Gerritt.
257247,snag,2008-10-10 13:37:00,1932,Thanks for the reminder.  I'm leaving work early today.........
257257,Leecher,2008-10-10 14:14:00,7832,Gerritt..... Hope you get through this day and my thoughs are with you and your family.
257265,Cookslav,2008-10-10 14:36:00,1457,"Hang in there Bud,  No one should have to go through the kind of loss you've endured. Its little comfort but its all I Have to offer....the Strength it takes to keep your head up and feet moving is admirable. Try and enjoy your day, and keep those tender memorys positive."
257266,Beans,2008-10-10 14:37:00,3339,"I remember reading your post vividly that day Gerritt...couldn't believe my eyes...and the outpouring of love and affection from all your OFC friends...  To me, that was the day that OFC became family..."
257274,fishnsled,2008-10-10 15:05:00,3520,Hang in there Gerritt.  Just wanted to let you know that you and your family will be in my thoughts today.  Will
257287,ccmtcanada,2008-10-10 15:23:00,7971,"Gerritt.  I cant even begin to imagine what you've been through.  I don't know where I'd get the strength from to go on, but you did.  OFC means many things to different people, but I for one am glad that it's far more than just a fishing board.  It's a glimpse into eachothers lives...both the good and the bad...to celebrate successes and to mourn and support after loss.  We're thinking of you today Gerritt...you'll get through it, and be a stronger person."
257294,silvio,2008-10-10 15:40:00,433,Hey G I cant imagine how difficult this is for you. Its wired how life works but we need to take it as it comes. I wish you all the best sorry to hear about your loss. Hang in there bud you'll be in my thoughts.
257295,Squid,2008-10-10 15:40:00,1656,We will always be there for ya Ger. God bless your son.
257302,Bernie,2008-10-10 16:12:00,3190,This all happened before I got to know you well Gerritt. I also cannot imagine the pain it caused you and your family. But you are a strong willed man and pulled yourself through it. I will say a prayer or two tonight for your loved one.
257313,johnnyb,2008-10-10 16:39:00,3413,"Wow...having a child myself, I can't imagine the pain you went through...thank you for sharing your story with all of us...God Bless"
257315,The Urban Fisherman,2008-10-10 16:42:00,2050,"wow Gerritt, I had no idea dude....  My daughter's never been sick in the two years since she's been born and reading this has really put into perspective how much I take it for granted.  Thanks for the life lesson learned.  You're family is in our thoughts today...I only wish I was around to lend my support six years ago.  Ryan"
257316,TJQ,2008-10-10 16:46:00,7806, I remember that day all the time...
