257698,rock34,2008-10-12 04:35:00,215,Does anyone have any info on Bronte Creek? Im not looking for specifics.....just wondering if I am waisting my time taking my brothers fishing on Monday.  They have never float fished and I would like to get them into a few for their first trips.  Cheers and good luck to you all!
