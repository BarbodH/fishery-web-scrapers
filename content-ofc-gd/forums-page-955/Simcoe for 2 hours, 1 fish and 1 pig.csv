255485,Cudz,2008-10-05 01:33:00,2652,I took 2 high school kids out on the lake as I had a 2 hour window to do something this afternoon.  I caught the first fish in 20ft of water.  A respectable 2 to 2.5 pound fish.  I told the boys that if I get another bite I would let them bring it in and sure enough I got another bite.  As soon as I set the hook I handed the rod off to one of the boys.  The fish turned out to be a real hawg.  I have fished for and caught lots of smallies but this was the fattest I have ever seen.  Pics don't do it justice.  It was a heavy fish and was she was obviously packing it on for the winter.  It too was caught in about 20 ft of water.  What a football.  The kid loved it. the last two pics are of the same fish.
