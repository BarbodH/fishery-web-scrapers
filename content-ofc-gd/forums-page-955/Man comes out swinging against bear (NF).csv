257194,ScarSnake,2008-10-10 11:19:00,20,"A sow attacked a man in BC, dude fights back with a stick, and somehow wins. Reminds me of the thread a few years ago about the guy who took on a bear with a knife and won.  http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/...k-survivor.html"
257198,Rich,2008-10-10 11:25:00,3927,That's awesome!
257205,Hawg Hunter,2008-10-10 11:36:00,204,"right on,lucky to still be here........amazing what a man can do  speaking of bears(not to take away from this story just more bear news)  did anyone see the news a few days ago about the bear that pushed open a subway door ,went in ,stood up at the counter(while the girl working there took off)and started to eat the meat out of the trays im not good with this computer stuff but id bet its on that u-tube???? my bud told me about it,when the bear left he pushed the door open and walked out lol as if hed done this before lol  Hawg Hunter"
257230,holdfast,2008-10-10 12:50:00,1813,This guy also had to fight off a bear in BC    
257272,Cookslav,2008-10-10 14:58:00,1457,Lucky is right...Adrenalin must have been a factor in perfecting his swing I'd say!

257395,glen,2008-10-10 20:33:00,2641,I am glad the guy is ok.  Sixty stitches to the head.  Ouch.  I thought you needed a 300 magnum for bear.  I guess a knife or a stick is enough.
257402,danbo,2008-10-10 21:02:00,2646,"The trick is to make yourself look big & don't yell at the bear. I guess it is natural to fight back with everything you've got. I wouldn't want to do it, but to save my life, I sure would! The dude is lucky.. I'm gonna go practice puttin' an armbar on my cat..lol."
257406,johnnyb,2008-10-10 21:14:00,3413,Unbelievable -- another reason to carry a beefy walking stick in bear country....I think Louisville makes a good one....
257453,Clampet,2008-10-11 01:15:00,1947,I had a cousin (way back in the 1920's) who killed a bear by ramming his pocket knife into the bruiser's ear. The blade broke off.
