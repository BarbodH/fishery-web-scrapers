It was my first time going to the opening ceramony after 20 years of festhallen, so this was something new to me.  The sausage and beers were already flyin by noon on the temps creeping over 20C leading into a great looking long weekend!  so enjoy and ""Ein Prosit"" to all!!!  oh, and check out my fish I caught yesterday on the Maitland...     There's Walter Ostenak in the middle loading up on the accordian and belting out the chicken dance to kick it off.           These two pics are of the same fish.   first fish of the day   last fish.   scenery   It was a nice relaxing three hours floating down the Maitland.  The water was high, fast and clearing. I saw a pool with two old boots swimming around and I saw a couple decent steelies in other deeper pools, with me only having bass gear!  Looks like a some great fall fishing on rivers with extended fall season's!"
