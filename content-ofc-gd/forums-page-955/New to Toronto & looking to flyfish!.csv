257400,nigglesworth,2008-10-10 20:45:00,3,"Moved to Toronto from Vancouver a few months ago and am itching to get some fly fishing in before the snow comes.  I would love to get out for trout, salmon or steelies.  If anyone feels like pointing me in the right direction, I am all ears.  I am happiest walking, hiking, wading...   and the further from crowds the better.  Would love to hear your trips.  I spent a week in Kilarney two weeks ago and am hungry for more!"
257410,wuchikubo,2008-10-10 21:23:00,1114,Welcome to the board. Since you mentioned you're in Toronto the start point has been determined but how far are you planning to go to get onto fish?  I'm sure some other will chime in soon.  Stan

257417,nigglesworth,2008-10-10 21:54:00,3,"HI Stan  I would be looking for two options.  A couple of day trip options would be nice.  But I may also have a couple of days off a week from now and wouldn't mind going a little further and perhaps camp and spend a few days.  Fall is my quiet time and I would like to get out as much as possible.  It has been a hard transition as Vancouver is blessed with a year round fishery and plenty of quiet spots close to the city!  Being new, I am up to exploring!"
