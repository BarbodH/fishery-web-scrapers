One thing I love about it is that I've got smaller hands and it's got such a low profile to it that I can chuck lures all day without getting a sore wrist..... other than that it's just an all around great reel.  My new favorite.  cheers, Ryan"

This sucks but this way i can get it for a present.It would of been nice to get in in a month or so as planned so i could give it a try but you can't always get what you want.  Make sure you tell us how it works jchau53.   Mike
256411,JFR,2008-10-08 12:43:00,498,"I agree with Raf,  Buy the best you can afford.  It only hurts once.  It is a matter of personal comfort in the long run.  I have been using Ambassadeur 5500's, 6500's and 7000's C3 models for over 40 years, and still use them today. These reels have caught their share of bass, pike, musky and salomonids over the years.  You have been given very good advice, but take your time to choose what you want. Go into a shop, ask to have the reel put on the rod you will be using, it it is comfortable in your hand then you are set. But don't rush, just because someone on the net says reel X is great, it may not suit you.  It is your money and investment take your time.  just JOHN"

Using wacky worms, crankbaits amd spiinerbaits.  Maybe I can still get a salmon off the rocks this year, throwing spoons.  Jose"
