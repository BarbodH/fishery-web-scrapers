I would like to do some fishing on saturday.  Since I have not lived here since I was a kid, I don't know where to go. Is the fishing still good down there? Any suggestions would be great!! Thanks"

257322,Marko,2008-10-10 17:04:00,854,I was going to say Fanshawe dam as well. Seen some reports from there lately and there seem to be healthy population of walleye around and white bass as well. good luck!
