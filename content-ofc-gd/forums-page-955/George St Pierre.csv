257681,steverowbotham,2008-10-12 03:21:00,1800,I'm watching the replay as well.  St. Pierre is a giant.  My brother is a professional fighter and I have had the opportunity to meet and dine with St. Pierre.  The dude has the widest shoulders I have ever seen.  So big for 170 pounds.  Super nice guy too!
