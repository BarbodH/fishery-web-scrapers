Wait until the sun is up and go to spots where the sun will be warming the water. Shallow or deep? I imagine they will be keying on about 10-15' of water, close to dropoffs into deeper water. Watch for baitfish action. The gulls are around now and will sometimes help with this, if you don't have electronics to find it yourself. I have been having luck with suspending jerkbaits this time of year.  Stop by if you get a chance...I could steer you towards some spots.
