254205,MuskyBill,2008-10-01 02:55:00,311,"For those of you who got shut out, you've got another chance.  Tickets go on sale for the second show on October 10 for a date at the Rogers Centre on January 9.  If you want to wait to see if it's worth it or not, those of us that were lucky enough to get great seats will let you know on November 8th, suckaz......"
254209,highdrifter,2008-10-01 03:04:00,2534," I'm also going to be in the 4th row..  Soooo, I'll see you there sucka!!  What say we have a little pre-rock OFC gathering?!  I'dd shave OFC in the back of my head, but I suppose I could just bring along a sign..  How many we got so far?!  HD"
254236,holdfast,2008-10-01 05:56:00,1813,"Saw the hells Bells Tour at the Mtl Forum good, But     THIS THURSDAY IM GOING TO SASKATOON TO SEE  YUP    ALICE COOPER"
254248,MuskyBill,2008-10-01 11:01:00,311,"Right on, Fidel!  I'm in the 4th row too, but in section 130B....grea seats nonetheless, but not quite where you'll be.  Grab me a pick from Malcolm!!!!"
254256,BITEME,2008-10-01 12:03:00,1969, Dont know if you have been to an ACDC show before but word of advice from a concert vetran you better bring earplugs not because it sounds bad  but because they are loud and the aim is to tear your head off
254274,Headhunter,2008-10-01 12:40:00,5703,"Yup, I'm with Biteme on that one... by far the loudest band I have ever heard! Louder than The Who, and Black Sabbath put together!!!!! ""The music is so loud, you can't hear the sound""! HH"
254296,highdrifter,2008-10-01 13:32:00,2534," Saw em at Downsview for Sars Stock.. Don't remember much, xept being carried to the other end of the stage when I was body surfing, if you can believe that!  I also distinctly remember that a huge crowd of people started streaming off the grounds when the Stones came on!! LOL  They shoulda been the headliners...  Thanks for the heads up Peter.  Rock on! HD"
254301,BITEME,2008-10-01 13:40:00,1969, Took the wife and kids to SARSTOCK dont forget they were using the Stones rig and a pre band is not allowed to be louder...........and i agree hands down even with a limited out put the made the Stones look like choir boys  you have been warned..dont expect any thing less then a constant ringing for a few days after
254305,JerseyDog,2008-10-01 13:57:00,190,I've seen them three times (SkyDome in 1996 / ACC in 2000 / Sarstock 2003) and damn right I'm going this time too.  One of the best classic rock bands ever and the best one still touring and recording.
254316,jwl,2008-10-01 14:42:00,1056,"to all the comments about the band being loud......you got that freekin right..whenI seen them ..""For Those About To Rock Tour""..I was pretty young,like 11-12 years old and right into loud music being a guitar player just getting into the hobby and such...I tell you when they blasted off the cannons on stage during that song..the whole place shook like it was going to fall apart...cannons over the PA system...yee hawwww...rates right up there with Rob Halford's mic'ed up Harley"
254473,Greencoachdog,2008-10-01 23:40:00,8163,I'm sure there are a lot of AC/DC's in Toronto.
255883,nancur373,2008-10-06 12:23:00,1211,My advice to anyone wanting tickets for the January show is to go to www.acdc.com and pay the $40.00 for the fan club. This gives you access to good seats not on sale to public. Maximum of 2 seats per member.
255946,kickingfrog,2008-10-06 17:01:00,8333,"No, I'm not going, I was born in the 70's.  Have fun."
255962,Troit,2008-10-06 18:23:00,19,"Well when i was younger never missed a show when it came to AC/DC, but it has also been a long time for me to see them again, at this point in time wouldnt missit even if the wife left me...lol  Troit"
256017,holdfast,2008-10-06 22:34:00,1813," Betcha, your wrong!!!!  Montreal is the Gay Capital of Canada.  Lots of AC-DCs there.  Don'T get caught alone in any Subway-Mens room.  You'll get accosted.  They like little Guys from Alabama."
257273,steve_paul,2008-10-10 15:04:00,658, Thanks for the tip Nancur - joined up and was able to get 2 tix this morning for the Jan 9 show - Section B4 on the Floor - think we will be 8 rows back from where you are in Nov so let me know how the seats are.  Picked them up as an anniversary present for the wife (12 years on Sunday).  She hasn't shot me yet so she deserves something good
251312,nancur373,2008-09-20 00:51:00,1211,Picked up a couple of tickets for the AC/DC show in November at the SkyDome. My brother and I are going. Our first time and it's pretty exciting. Anyone else going?
251316,jwl,2008-09-20 01:01:00,1056,"I heard they where already sold out,should be a great show though, I seen them many years ago....For Those About To Rock tour, that was a wicked concert."
251320,danbo,2008-09-20 01:16:00,2646,Angus..Angus..Angus!! I saw 'em at the Ex years back..Who Made Who concert! Yassah!
251321,BillM,2008-09-20 01:29:00,17367,I saw them when they were one of the first concerts at the Skydome..  For Those About to Rock....  just wait you'll lose your mind
251322,danbo,2008-09-20 01:40:00,2646,Party hearty!!  
251324,jwl,2008-09-20 01:43:00,1056,"ah I remember the ""good ole days""when I was a teenager in the 80's and could see almost any of my favorite bands for between like 12-20 bucks a ticket, and sometimes that was even on a party bus..those where the days  have a blast at the show man AC-DC puts on one heck of a hard rockin concert"
251325,danbo,2008-09-20 01:45:00,2646,
251327,jediangler,2008-09-20 01:48:00,1923,"I saw them for the ""Fly on the Wall"" tour in TO at the gardens. I think it was 85 or 86. I was actually there to see the opening act. It was Yngwie Malmsteen. He was amazing, I ended up getting one of his guitar picks that night, still have it. The boys from downunder did put on a great show and Angus' energy is endless. You'll enjoy yourself."
251339,MuskyBill,2008-09-20 02:49:00,311,"Yup, got 3 in section 130B, 4th row....  I just looked at my old ticket stubs. Saw 'DC at the Gardens almost exactly 20 years ago, October 13, 1988 & the price on the stub is $24.50.  AC/DC must be like fine wine, they get more expensive with age.  I actually like my rock to be a little heavier, but the g/f & I are taking her 12 year old son to his first real rock 'n roll  show. Should be a treat, to say the least!"
251341,taper,2008-09-20 03:25:00,611,Ive seen them twice and I managed tickets again. Actually it was my son that made me get them. He really wants to see them in concert.
251388,darsky,2008-09-20 16:07:00,586,I love this one the best-LOL !!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FONt47Z0KZg...feature=related
251391,Carp,2008-09-20 16:21:00,1488,"I'd love to see AC/DC, but didn't get tickets before they sold out. Hope they add a second show. If anyone has a ticket that's not spoken for yet, I'll take it."
251430,taper,2008-09-20 22:05:00,611,Carp I can't say for sure but I may have an extra seat. As soon as I know I will let you know.
251438,musky66,2008-09-20 22:44:00,273,"Never a huge AC/Dc fan- but have seen some great bands...KISS in the Gardens in '79 was my first. Seen Rush many times, and will forever remember the two Queen shows! Now my 16 year old son and I rock out to Canadian bands like April Wine whenever we can!"
251478,cpguy29,2008-09-21 02:20:00,148,Saw them at Skydome during the Ballbreaker tour. What a show! Big wrecking ball smashed a mock building they had on stage then Angus runs out. Lots of j's passed around.
251487,Badger Shark,2008-09-21 04:04:00,291,"Got 3 tickets, we were 2nd in line and the box office opened we wanted 100s and they were almost gone 2 min after they opened.  We managed 3 in the 130 level as well I believe.  When we got home we checked online and everthing was gone and people were selling tickets from 350 to 1000 dollars per ticket for the same ones we got.  Man it should be a cool show, never been to Skydome for anything.  I believe there will be a second show here in Ottawa but I dont think it will be till next summer since they want to do a stadium and well we blew ours up!  The talk is they will do it at the raceway.  Hope so cause I will go to that as well.  Now all I need is to see Metallica, which will come this way next year hopefully."
251515,Stoty,2008-09-21 12:58:00,2910,"Not going to that, even though I would love too!  But I am going to Carrie Underwood at the ACC!!!!"
251516,jwl,2008-09-21 13:06:00,1056," and you are admitting that infront of all these members on the board  , I hope what you are trying to say is that you have a hot date with this even hotter woman who promises to make your wildest fantasies come true right after you take her to the concert"
251520,MuskyBill,2008-09-21 13:24:00,311,"Poor, poor Stoty...."
251632,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-22 00:09:00,241,I am going to this show as well. I've never seen them live before so I'm pretty stoked. I hope they tear the roof off of the joint!
251660,superdad,2008-09-22 01:24:00,353,"There are some tickets for sale at the Buy N Sell portion of quintefishing.com, quite a price for them- IMHO"
251669,nancur373,2008-09-22 01:38:00,1211,Our seats are in FLR B4. Row 11
251700,holdfast,2008-09-22 03:16:00,1813," Figures you'd like that.  She totally wrecked that song.  Its actually embarrassing.  The AC DC is to indicate that they have power, not being Gay"
251702,holdfast,2008-09-22 03:18:00,1813,Seen them at the Forum during the Hells Bells tour.
251724,nancur373,2008-09-22 09:34:00,1211,Anyone know if there is a minimum age to get in to the show?
