It's disappointing when we both booked time off work and were planning a Thursday-Sunday trip for some pike.  Does anyone have any recommendations for 2 guys looking to rent a cottage & boat for a few nights?  We had initially planned this with a $500 budget and not sure where to look with such little time.  We're looking for a place around 2hrs-3hrs drive from the barrie area.  Perhaps North Bay would be a good place to start?  Sorry, we just started to get in to fishing this year and don't know all the good places to be planning trips.  Thanks, Gov"
