Codes............ Cs85mlbro........c85mlbro and ?  "

Good Fishing,  Justin"
257281,Reel Trouble,2008-10-10 15:16:00,14, We are  talking about these 2 specific coloured lures
257284,JustinHoffman,2008-10-10 15:19:00,482,"Sorry, bud...your post makes no mention of looking for two specific ""COLOURS"" - thought you just meant the Red Fins themselves...as your two photos show a Red Fin and a Ripplin Red Fin.  Good luck in your search.  Justin  P.S. I see you've now edited it to show exactly what you're looking for..."
257360,danbo,2008-10-10 18:48:00,2646,You can paint your own details on them using Nail Polish. Squash Orange for the bellies & Bright Red for the Pectoral Fins & Gills..
257362,ChrisK,2008-10-10 18:55:00,2772,Awsome bait. Went one for two on the blue and chrome 2 weekends ago in St. Clair Thames river mouth..... Not shure where to get them now but if you look around in the smaller tackle shops you may find some stock hanging around..  Good luck !!
257364,danbo,2008-10-10 18:57:00,2646,LeBaron's has 'em!
257437,Rich,2008-10-11 00:05:00,3927,"I'd give you mine but the pike ate them all in that color. Man that was a killer, especially the Izumi one"
257482,Fishmaster,2008-10-11 03:38:00,920,I think i have every color they sold 1 or 2 or 3 of them and they are staying in my box ...Ripplens don't catch fish lol
257484,PatrickGG,2008-10-11 03:55:00,562,"I bought a couple of them at Wal-Mart last year, check in your area they are scarce but you just mite stumble across a couple."
257488,gone_fishin,2008-10-11 04:09:00,481,"CT in ajax had both of those, on sale no less ($3 a piece), just a week ago... only one or two of each, so their probably gone now."
