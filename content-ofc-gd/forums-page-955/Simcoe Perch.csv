By far the biggest perch I ever caught.  Measured over 1 ft in length and 22 cm in girth. Most perch were in the 8-9 inch area but caught at least a dozen over 10 CM.  When I got home, I noticed the big guy was tagged.  Anyone know what I should do with it? "

257490,highdrifter,2008-10-11 04:23:00,2534,"NICE!  By any means necessary, get rid of that tag, they're zeroing in your location right now.  teehheee..  what BU said.  I hope she wasn't wormy.  cheers HD"
