256670,solopaddler,2008-10-08 23:51:00,8605,"I havn't slept since Sunday night so I'm a bit loopy at the moment. I worked 36 hours Mon and Tues, then left to go fishing straight from the office at 6am this morning... But hey that's the nature of the sport, you watch the weather, time the runs, and when things look perfect you drop everything and GO.  Needless to say this will be more of a ""photo essay"" as I'm a wee bit tuckered out  LOL!  Being alone today I took very few photos and the ones that I did take all look the same and aren't overly artistic  . I did get a couple of shots holding fish though as nearby anglers helped out...  The river today was loaded with chrome steelhead. This early in the season the fish are incredibly powerful and many of these fish took me for quite a ride.  All fish were caught on med. sized roe bags tied in white and chartreuse. Happily, today I confirmed that our local fish LOVE Alaskan coho roe. Thankfully I brought 20lb's of it home with me  .  Here's a smattering of todays catch:                                                           Fish on doods!"
