257042,Clampet,2008-10-09 23:34:00,1947,"Wow! Those are Huuuuuuuuge Perch, man!  Lake Wahnapitae, eh.  I know that the Wanahpitae river becomes the Veuve river as it winds it's way towards Verner, and eventually to the mouth of  Cache Bay, my old home town.  There used to be some spots on that river that produced some big Pickerel (10-12+lbs) back in the day. Thanks fer sharin' hope we hear more from you. "
