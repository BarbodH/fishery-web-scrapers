257012,RangerGuy,2008-10-09 22:21:00,564,"I purchaced this a few months back but haven't stalled it yet.   http://products.ram-mount.com/rammount/pro...umber=RAM-108-D  Would you put up with the mount sticking straight up on your gunnel?  Problem is because of the width of the mounting braket. I had to install the TM on an angle. Which causes the head of the motor to hang outside of the boat and I can only park my boat on 1 side of the dock. (Really pain sometimes).  I would have to install this unit right on the gunnel instead of on the inside gunnel or floor.  If I was to reposition the motor so the head is even with the gunnel I would have to reposition my plug for my bow light. This means plugging a 1.5"" whole and drilling another one. As well as 6 more bolt holes in a the bow area of a 20 year old Ranger.  Thoughts?"
257014,ohhenrygsr,2008-10-09 22:24:00,947,what kinda trolling motor is it check this one out might give you an idea on mounting wise  http://sites.mercurymarine.com/portal/page...;_schema=PORTAL  http://www.minnkotamotors.com/products/acc...il.asp?pg=mka29
257049,irishfield,2008-10-09 23:43:00,26272,I just made my own with 2 u-clamp mounted balls and a universal Ram joiner.  Wouldn't be without it considering my unit is 70 inches long!

257058,RangerGuy,2008-10-10 00:00:00,564,"Maybe I should just acept that I need to mount it on top of the gunnel.  I wish Ram solid a 24"" arm HAHAHA!  Oh I have  54"" Terrova 24v 80lb w/autopilot"
257061,irishfield,2008-10-10 00:07:00,26272,I'm lucky I have the rail there on my Lund. I leave the lower u-clamp just loose enough that I can wiggle it back to where the rail goes down to the gunnel so my trailering cover fits over it without even touching the ball.
257101,RangerGuy,2008-10-10 01:31:00,564,Yeh that would be cool... I'll just have to remember to use the big beckman on the oposite side of the boat LOL!
257389,RangerGuy,2008-10-10 19:56:00,564,Well if anybody has the same issue as I.. I thought I'd share my solution  Ram sells a Suction Cup mount it's quite strong.. So I thought I'll try that and if it doesn't work I'll just take it back...  Well I put on my gunnel.. and can rock the boat pushing and pulling on it.. So I'm pretty sure it's gonna do the job and I didn't have to screw into my gunnel YEPPIE!  Now the rubber does allow some minor movement but if that little bit of shaking damages the autopilot then it's a piece of junk HAHAHA!  This is the one I got BPS only had 1 type in stock. http://products.ram-mount.com/rammount/pro...AM-B-138-224-1U  Seems to work great
257399,Uncle Buck,2008-10-10 20:43:00,1000,"The ram suction cup mount is amazing... i've got my GPS in the car on it, and i've driven down some brutal roads where i thought for sure it would pop off, but the thing sticks like it's welded!!"
