If fishing was slow, or there are a million people there I was thinking of heading further upstream for a few bass, but noticed in the regs that bass season closes at the end of september in grey/bruce counties. What has my confused is that in the zone 16 regs they say all ""inland streams and rivers only"" that bass closes sept 30 in grey/bruce. But wouldn't all rivers in zone 16 be considered inland? So I'm not sure why they worded it this way? Or is there something I'm missing.  My interpretation on this is that all rivers are inland and so I can no longer fish for bass in the saugeen, or any other river in those counties. Have I interpreted this correctly? I certainly don't want to be fishing out of season.  Thanks, Tim"

Got a link or page number? Ah, possibility, if the rivers are closed to Trout, (30 Sep), they often close the mentioned rivers to all species just to keep everyone honest,  you know, honest officer I was targeting bass....with a 15 foot noodle rod and roe."
