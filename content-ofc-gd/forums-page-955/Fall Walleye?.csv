Thanks in advance,  Yv"

257250,OhioFisherman,2008-10-10 13:43:00,6623,"I have never fished for them this late in Ontario, the idea is still the same though, you can`t catch them if you don`t find them. Don`t go with a preconceived idea of where they will be, and don`t get stuck on a pattern that isn`t working because you think it should.  We have got them 6 feet deep in July and 20 feet deep in September, no way to tell where they will be. If your fishing with some one else one go shallow and one go deeper, eg, one troll a shallow to medium diving crank bait one a bottom hugging setup like a worm harness.  A big minnow or chub can also be fished like that one shallow on a slip float, one near the bottom if you have a partner, see what is catch the most fish, gives you a clue as to the depth you need to concentrate more of your time on.  Baitfish, find them find fish, the feed bag should be on, unless your willing to run and gun, trolling may get you on them quicker, you just cover more of an area. Points are usually a good place to start."
