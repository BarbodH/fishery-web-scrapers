246591,capt_hooked,2008-09-04 14:24:00,212,"Thanks Roy for letting us know about Gary's passing, although this is very sad news.  Leslie and I always looked forward to seeing Gary at the OFC weekends and were sad when he could not make it up the last couple of years due to poor health.  According to all the tributes here on the board he was very well loved and respected. Some of these posts are from folks we have not heard of for some time. Its good to see and read their thoughts.  Our condolences to all of Gary's family and friends.   The problem about having friends is that someday we all have to say good-bye! And although sad, it is not so sad as the alternative.    Kevin and Leslie and family."

I know its already been posted, but his personal statement is something we should all take to heart every day.  If life was simply a bowl of cherries we would probably start looking for the pits, enjoy life, treasure the good times, keep the good memories with you, and whenever possible live your life to the fullest.  I never had the pleasure of meeting him personally (my loss), but it is like I knew him.  Its not often that you shed tears for someone you've never personally met.  Thank you OFC for some of the wonderful people we would not otherwise meet.  Rest in peace my friend."

246556,Headhunter,2008-09-04 13:01:00,5703,"I am shocked! I had been Pming Gary occasionally to find out how he was doing. I to, was under the impression that he licked the illness he had earlier this year and I stopped PMing... now, this news. I had only joined up to this board for about 6 months, when I posted that I was going to be in the Grand Bend area for a week and if any OFNer lived in the area and wanted someone to fish with, I'd be happy to join them. Well, Gary contacted me quickly. He lived in Lampton Shores, a short drive from where we were staying. We met up, I was introduced to his wife and his Amy, and off we went to chase some smallies. Now, here's a testament to the quality of man he was... the lake was angry that day. 3-4 footers rolling into the area that Gary fishes. I know for a fact that he would have turned around and gone home to his family if it weren't for me being there, but he said, what the heck Joe, this is the only open day I have to get out, so let's give it a try. We tried for a few hours, nothin doing, but the time I spent with Gary is time I will always remember. Gary had run his own businesses and had his feet firmly planted on the ground. He was the kind of person who you could ask for advice and know for a fact that the advice coming back would be sound. His love for his family was evident in every conversation. He shared his knowledge of props to anyone who asked. Man, I am still in shock... we've lost a good one. My sincere condolences to his family and friends. We will miss him. HH"

We just got in from celebrating my wifes birthday and I checked my email and found the message from David and was just about to post it here.  Gary was without doubt one of the nicest people we've ever had on OFC and I've considered him a good friend for a very long time. We've exchanged many PM's and emails over the years and have talked on the phone many times with alot of our discussions being about his beloved dog Amy and my dog Marvin.  His specialty around here was outboard motor propellers and he's helped out many many OFC members with their propeller problems.  Gary will be sadly missed by those of us that knew him well and to those of you who never had the pleasure of knowing him, you missed out on a wonderful person.  Rest in peace my friend and my very deepest condolances to your loved ones."

That where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness. That where there is discord, I may bring harmony. That where there is error, I may bring truth. That where there is doubt, I may bring faith. That where there is despair, I may bring hope. That where there are shadows, I may bring light. That where there is sadness, I may bring joy. Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted. To understand, than to be understood. To love, than to be loved. For it is by self-forgetting that one finds. It is by forgiving that one is forgiven. It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life.  Splashhopper and Botbot"
