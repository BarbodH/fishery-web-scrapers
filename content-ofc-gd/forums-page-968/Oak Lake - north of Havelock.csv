This will be first time I will venture in this area, so needless to say I know nothing about it.  Thus, I'm looking for GPS of the ""honey holes"", ""weeds plantations"" in the woods, nearest""Hooters"" location and so on and on( you all know what I'm talking about)  Seriously, any info in regards to fishing will be appreciated, either posted on this thread or send by PM  thanks in advance"
225121,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-08 23:19:00,2585,"bass, pike if im not mistaking.  I fished this lake like 15 years ago so not sure what its like now.  Hope you get into a few!  Cheers!"
225159,ehg,2008-07-09 00:22:00,2666,"I read about this lake a long time ago and was left with impression that walleye were the main species targeted. Seemed like both bass species were there as well as pike, oddly lake trout and cisco might be there with panfish maybe crappie. Swore i read about musky there but that was a long time ago. Sounds good anyways, ehg"
