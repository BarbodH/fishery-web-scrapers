247570,Musky or Specks,2008-09-08 03:29:00,2710,"Well its been a great year of fishing for my buddy John. In June I managed to get him onto his PB stream brook trout    Then two weeks ago while on Sparrow he gets his PB largemouth    This weekend he was able to get up to the Sudbury chapter of Musky's Canada outing while I had to stay at home in  the K=Dub. He gets his PB musky. Out of a 4-5 ft weed flat on the West Arm. She came on a Chartruese Bucktail with a silver blade and measured in at a glorious 49.5"" x 23"". I hope to still get in the 50 inch club before he does.     Now its my turn Johnnyboy."
