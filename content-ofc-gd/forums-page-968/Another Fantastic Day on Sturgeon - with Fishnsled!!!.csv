247382,Moosebunk,2008-09-07 14:09:00,3970,Agree with Scuro.  That is an awesome pic of Bly and her muskie.  Absolute pouring rain bassin' and esox fishing.  I like it guys.  Good show.
247394,TJQ,2008-09-07 15:14:00,7806,Awesome report.. that rain looked ugly....  nice fish bly!!
247426,ehg,2008-09-07 17:17:00,2666,"Congrats to Bly on the PB muskie. That Kawarthas bass- musky- walleye fishing is real fun. Thanks for posting this, ehg"
247430,Radnine,2008-09-07 17:42:00,1538,"You guys are an inspiration! Nice report, thanks as always. Jim"
247431,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-07 17:46:00,3761,Another amazing report!!!  Thanks for sharing
247438,fishnsled,2008-09-07 18:22:00,3520," It certainly was a great day with a couple of amazing people.  ( Bly - remember it's a family board now.  )  Cliff and Sue, certainly nice to chat with you two and thanks for the use of the golf cart.  It's always great when a plan comes together but it's even better when you really have no plan at all.  Not to often you get the Kawartha Grand Slam (Muskie, walleye, largemouth and smallmouth), in a couple of hours! Congrats again Bly on the PB, nice to get the craddle slimmed up with a couple of your fish.  Also, thank you for putting together a great lunch!    Cliff - I guess it's too late to take you up on your ofter to go for some salmon (I was horizontal by 10pm  ) but let's try to do that one night this week.  Great job with the photos as well.  I think your skills are getting better since we did the bass fishing shoot on Scugog.    I'm sure that Bly and I will need you again when we do the fall muskie trip.    All kidding aside, you two are welcome in the boat anytime and I'm certainly looking forward to our next trip.  Thanks for the great report Cliff"
247502,mattyk,2008-09-07 23:36:00,2110,some nice fish!
247505,tbayboy,2008-09-07 23:41:00,1497,Congrats to all 3 of you.  Sounds like a great wet day on the water.  I see the big 50 in Bly's near future!
247508,Bernie,2008-09-07 23:44:00,3190,Very well done! Nice fish!

247679,bassjnkie,2008-09-08 16:24:00,1101,"Great report, nice fish. WTG!!"
247691,Reef Runner,2008-09-08 16:56:00,980,Looks like you two are having a banner year.   I there anytime you guys go out that you don't top a PB?
247700,douG,2008-09-08 17:19:00,2693,"Well done, Carole.  Congratulations!"
247701,Ramble,2008-09-08 17:21:00,713,"GOod report, and Nice fish. Those were some nice clean lookin Musky. Good job.  I'm ready for the next report anytime.  -R-"
247702,Ramble,2008-09-08 17:22:00,713,Sorry about the double post. Have a bit of a user interface issue.  -R-
247710,Bly,2008-09-08 17:41:00,1556,"  Thanks and of course we have outings like that.  There are also many outings when we go home skunked or we downsize just to feel the tug of panfish on the line before the day is done, we just figure no one wants to read about skunks and panfish day after day so no post."
247721,Reef Runner,2008-09-08 18:27:00,980," Sorry Bly, I'm sure you guys have those days as we all do. lol.  If anyone wanted to read about skunks and panfishes, I'll direct them to my reports.  lol."
247724,ecmilley,2008-09-08 18:39:00,2163,"great going there, never got out once on the weekend, but the lake sure looked good just had way to much to do this weekend"
247732,solopaddler,2008-09-08 20:09:00,8605,"Once again nice fish guys, well done!"
247789,maybe,2008-09-08 22:44:00,307,Wow...that's some impressive musky herding.  Way to go!!
247272,ccmtcanada,2008-09-07 00:39:00,7971,"We hooked up with Fishnsled for a day of fishing today.  When I talked to Fishnsled Friday night, we didn't have a target species or even a lake picked out....LOL.  Bly and I arrived at his place at 530 this morning.  When he asked if we decided where to go, we just laughed.  We narrowed it down to either Sturgeon Lake or the Tri-lakes.  Fishnsled got a coin and it turned out to be heads.....Sturgeon Lake was our destination.  The weather forecast earlier this week said rain on Saturday, but by Friday, it said only a 20% chance.  As we arrived at the boat launch it started pouring.  Here's Bly surveying the launch......   As we headed out into the lake, the rain lets up...Fishnsled and I start rigging our rods and Bly is throwing a big spinnerbait.  Fishnsled looks up and says ""Oh..starting out big early??""  Literally 2 casts later, Bly yells ""FISH ON!!!""  It's a muskie....and a fair sized one too!  Here's a pic of her bringing it in....   Here's the 'money' shot...her new PB measured in at 38 inches and had a healthy 15 inch girth.  So...two weeks ago, she had yet to catch her first..and now this is her 4th....when she decides to catch something...she doesn't fool around....LOL.   And back she goes...to swim another day....   The rain was off an on all morning long, but nothing all that driving that it chased us from the lake.  Besides...the bite was on, so we didn't mind at all!  As far as we were concerned, the sun could stay behind the clouds all day long.  Here's some of the other fish we caught in these conditions....  My Bass....   Fishnsled and Bly got into some Walleye....now filleted and in our fridge....     Then Fishnsled put on a bass clinic for us with a few nice ones....they weighed in at just a tad under 3 and 4 pounds.  He also caught a bunch of smaller ones.     Then....Bly (now named Musky queen), hooked into another nice one!  This one didn't jump like crazy like her others...but stayed deep right up until the end...this one measured in at 35""   The sun started to peak out, so we had to head back to the launch to pick up Fishnsled's sunglasses.  We took a detour at Big Cliff's place to say hi.  While we were there, he treated us like royalty, giving us the use of this golf cart to boot over to the marina to pick up the sunglasses.....haha.   We left Big Cliff's place with the sun blazing....and the bite also turned off.  I lost a few fair sized bass that I had hooked, and Fishnsled brought one to the boat.   A bunch of nice sized panfish were caught when we downsized our baits....but the bigger fish were nowhere to be found.....   We got off the water around mid afternoon to make the trek back home.  We had yet another GREAT day with Fishnsled.  Lots of laughs, chatting, eating and of course fish.  Can't wait to hook up again later in the fall....with Muskie being our main target!!!  Thanks Will!  You wanna go chuck some spoons for salmon tonight??? LOL"
247273,lunkerbasshunter,2008-09-07 00:47:00,2585,wow great report!  Awesome fish!  Cheers!
247275,jwl,2008-09-07 00:51:00,1056,"nice report, you better watch out for your wife now Cliff, she's gonna be costing you a fortune in $20 musky baits...not to mention all the rubbing it in on all the big ones lately  , sounds like you guys salvaged a great day on the water, and sticking it out payed off.   Go figure on Bly's big one of the day too...second cast...that's the way it goes with musky fishing sometimes, other times you can fish for a week and not get any.  thanks for sharing all the pics  ummm maybe you could use her on your team to add to your musky inches"
247278,Rich,2008-09-07 00:59:00,3927,Great stuff as always!

247303,ccmtcanada,2008-09-07 01:57:00,7971," I'm used to the abuse I get when she outfishes me....which by the way is a LOT...LOL.  Yep...I could use her on my team....but she's not in the tourney at all, so at least she can't hurt us...haha    Hey Grant!! Great to hear from you again....looking forward to fall piking???  I'd love to join you again on another outing!!"
247305,Wild,2008-09-07 02:03:00,704,HAHA you guys look so wet and looks like you don't care a bit... and why wouldn't you!

247326,jediangler,2008-09-07 04:56:00,1923,"That looks like another fun outing. Congrats on your new PB bly. I guess by now you've got full blown musky fever   . Don't feel bad Cliff, my wife outfishes me for musky too."
247328,scuro,2008-09-07 06:35:00,386,"Yeah, that is the real money shot.  I'm working on my wife...she could so hardcore."
247345,b2kptbo,2008-09-07 11:29:00,1505,Except for the rain it was a good outing for sure...

247369,Bly,2008-09-07 13:38:00,1556,"Thank you everyone!   It was a great day with great company, always a pleasure to get to spend time with FnS  ( )  and Cliff & Sue   .   Cliff has no worries about me and $20 baits, I usually get a good deal at the local shops  LOL  Lew's fish would view mine as an appetizer !!   Thanks again Lew for the encouragement and words of wisdom.  LOL Joey,  fish whisperess eh?   Thanks again!!"
247370,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-07 13:40:00,0,"Great Report! Was thinking of heading to Sturgeon for some smallies, but I think I may try for some largies instead! Congrats to Bly for breaking yet another PB."
247377,MJL,2008-09-07 13:59:00,2427,Fantastic report Cliff and big congrats Bly on the new PB.  Do I really have to sell my soul to the devil to catch fish like that?  Couldn't I just lease mine to DSN until I catch all the PB's I want?
