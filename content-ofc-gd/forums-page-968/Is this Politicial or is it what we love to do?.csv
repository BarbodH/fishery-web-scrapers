246994,jedi jeffi,2008-09-05 18:32:00,12,"Is this political or is it about what we love to do? (Answer at the end) Well, we are hours away from an election call, and we can see the lines being drawn in the sand. We have leadership (?) and get tough on criminals on one side, Leadership (?) and carbon tax will help save the earth on the other. And no one, including the general public paying  to the other issues! Let alone the right of Canadians to be informed or involved in processes that affect their lives. This is not to argue any of the leaders’ abilities or policies.  This is about what we can do as outdoors people to ensure our access rights to Canadian waterways. This is about the right to know about â€œworksâ€ on waterways so that we can act as guardians to help make sure environmental laws and procedures are followed. And this is about if there are inadequacies in proposed legislation that our various outdoor organizations can represent their members to ensure that what ever is decided is balanced, not only for present users, but also for future generations of Canadians.  Our goal here is to make sure we (hunt/fish/enviro/paddlers….) are invited to the table for the next round. Not getting invited can not be an option! We have a great weapon and we need to use it now! The internet.  We have forums, blogs web sites….., email the big professional people on this, get them to take a stand, they have been way too quiet. (all of them)  We/you can make a difference, but every one of us needs to be involved, and yes, it is that simple, we stand together.  We have over 30 days to type, copy, and paste, to make others aware of one of the true treasures of Canada (Access rights to Canadian water ways) Do not reply to this posting. If you want everyone to know Just write â€œbumpâ€ If you want to debate;  pm me. If you do question your candidates, record the question and their answers, time/date/place/witnesses, we your group rep will need this info when we get to the next round. And post it! If we can get them to start contradicting themselves, we can make it news! I did not setup or invent this site; I am involved in the forums. But I do…. http://www.ispeakforcanadianrivers.com/ Do you? Get your user group to represent your views! Jeff McColl Answer: You already have the answer."
247004,Reef Runner,2008-09-05 19:07:00,980,Bump.  welcome to the board Jeff.  Do a search and check out verminator's appeal in this regard.
247770,jedi jeffi,2008-09-08 21:42:00,12,"I have met verminator through the forums and appreciated his postings but was unable to reach him through pm's So here's some more bad news. as outdoors people we really need to stand beside each other.  Here is a link to what is happening in B.C.  Then google 49 megawatts, we are about 2 years behind them in what is going on. I know it is a kayak film but it does look at the issue from a fishing/wildlife side too! We have all heard how the wild salmon fishery is in trouble out west, the can make you get a permit to fish for one but they can’t make the effort so the natural spawning watersheds are protected?..... And now….. In Ontario we have had a number micro hydro projects but forward this year, with the latest being on the Petawawa (2).  And we all know that a lot of fish spawn in the moving water. Here is a link to Ontario dam sites, and this list is very incomplete. Most sites are on public (yours) land, many existing dams that do not have micro hydro plants are privately owned. And the list does not include any old dam sites were a license is still owned by someone. http://www.owa.ca/pdfs/news/Waterpower_Potential_Nov2005.pdf Dam sites start at page 37 and are broken in to regions and categories. 1:  Practical and Probable Projects 2:  Practical Projects 3:  Remaining sites (not practical) Remember not practical does not mean someone as an individual could apply for that site and make a dam, the other sites can just make more money. I can only speak of the rivers/dams that I know. Example Gull River, Trent Severn System, Norland Ontario, existing dam, has the flow and vertical drop, is not listed for hydro development. Why? The big fish/hunt/enviro guys are virtually non existent in this battle. Look at B.C., Government hiding behind the “green” energy plan. I literally fell into this, I severely broke my tail bone in the middle of February, and when I could begin to sit again “found” the Navigable waters Protection Act . And then all this other “stuff” I like you just like to be out there, and I just want to keep going, and make sure others can to. So help “persuade” the big kids to come out and play, they have been quiet way too long. Jeff McColl http://www.ispeakforcanadianrivers.com/"

247787,holdfast,2008-09-08 22:39:00,1813,Unfortunately water Hydraulic energy is clean and relatively safe and is something that Canada has an abundance of.  We all rely on it.  So what are the other options? Coal and Nuclear power.  Forgot about the Windmills.  I was up in a helicopter and I can tell ya that they are unsightly.  Hopefully the governments are smart enough to weigh in the factors.  IE electricity or a persons recreational activity.
247793,blarg,2008-09-08 22:52:00,289,Unsightly? if i can still turn the lights on and still go fishing  can put up with alot of windmills.
247872,jedi jeffi,2008-09-09 02:29:00,12,"Let's make this simple build dam, kill off spawning beds in the fast water. Trout river become koi pond Fence off Dam land areas because of liability issues, Sneak in to fish, get charged with trespassing, Your crown lands given away for next to nothing so someone else can make a profit. In Ontario many of the sites are on rivers that normally in the dry months (3 months or more) this year was abnormally wet. No one is argueing their will be a need for more hydro but destroying entire watersheds shouldn't be an option. You can do nothing or you can make sure there is something left for the next guy. Think of it as catch and release. Fish farms and hatchers are not the answer, look at the disease problem in the farms, and no government wants to fund restocking any more, You join a group and you fund raise to help out. Why can't the dam builders be responsable for the costs of maintaining the fish stocks.... Go ahead build the dams, but cover the true costs, as the flyers have said over the last couple of weeks, ""not on my dime!"" Jeff"
