247309,B Diddy,2008-09-07 02:34:00,33,"Hi all....taking the family (Wife & 2 boys 8 & 10) out for a days fishing tomorrow.  Was thinking of Head Lake out by Norland, but with the weather looking iffy I thought about maybe staying a little closer to home & trying Lake St. John.  Does anyone have any info on these lakes?  We have been hitting Simcoe a bit this year but am tired of ending up perch fishing.  Told the buddies we're going for some real fish tomorrow     Of course if someone is willing to share their Simcoe secrets that's even closer yet.  We just can't seem to figure it out.  Thanks in advance  Bill"
247340,B Diddy,2008-09-07 10:44:00,33,Nothing eh....oh well.  I guess I'll see how adventureous the family is today.  My votes goes to Head lake.  I've heard it's good for bass & possibly even a muskie
247347,Rizzo,2008-09-07 11:51:00,4754,"I've always found L St. John very predictable and have always done well there. Pretty much a big bowl with weeds around the perimeter of the whole Lake. Pike up to 10 lbs a possibility. Having said that, I would choose Head Lake. Likely less company due to lousy boat launch, great variety of structure to fish and a pretty good shot at a musky, and lots of smallmouth."
247378,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-07 13:59:00,0,"I personally would choose Lake St.John. More panfish for the kids. Head lake is ok but really rocky. If you don't know the lake, go very slow."
247530,Rizzo,2008-09-08 01:13:00,4754," good point...I was thinking where would I go...forgot the ""family"" part...change my vote to St. John as well"
247597,B Diddy,2008-09-08 10:59:00,33,Hi Guys....ended up hitting St John for a couple hours before the rain got too bad & the wife & kids had enough.  Managed a decent bass & a hammer handle pike.  Scared up a couple follows & that was about it.  The kids are ready to get into some bigger fish now for sure so hopefully I can get them out for some good bass fishing.  I would sure love to figure out simcoe a bit.  Is the lake usually tough or do we just have aweful luck.  It's a very convenient location for us to hit  Bill
247599,Gerritt,2008-09-08 11:27:00,6129,Bill... I practically grew up on Lake St. John and would be pleased to help get you on fish... send me a pm.  G
