247364,spinnerdoc,2008-09-07 13:08:00,556,"well here is the deal , you should always lock your cars and not to leave anything valuable visible or nothing at all...esp when you guys are fishing at night... well i did all that but what can you do if someone wants your front bumper? hell nothing...unless you catch the guy trying to steal it. yup stupid wanted to take my bumper, exept they probably dont know what the hell he's doing, well he managed to pry the screws on both passenger and driver side then tried to pry the part at the hood..scratched my hood in the process, probably shaking like hell and could not put the damn screw driver to a slot...what goes around comes around... my guess is somebody walked by and freak this theif out , whoever that stranger may be thank you just for walkin by and saved my front bumper from being stolen"
247373,modny,2008-09-07 13:50:00,502,"is your bumper gold plated?  either way, who the hell steals a bumper? what the heck!  will insurance take care of this/?/"
247376,spinnerdoc,2008-09-07 13:57:00,556,"i was able to screw both sides back and the scratch i'll deal with it later. i'm not even gonna bother with insurance. what goes around comes around.  ps my bumper is stock , not gold plated so beats the hell out of me why go through the trouble of doing such a thing..."
247380,Wild,2008-09-07 14:08:00,704,It depends on what car you own but most likely some young punk who had an accident and can't afford the parts to repair. Emission control theft is high on the list so watch your cats!
247381,MJL,2008-09-07 14:08:00,2427,"That totally sucks.  People do strange things for $.  I imagine it was probably going to be sold in the auto-parts market.  In my case, I don't think anyone in their right mind would want to steal a bumper from my car which we've Christened, ""The Rustang"""
247385,Grimace,2008-09-07 14:19:00,2020,There is platinum in the cats that they like to take to the scrapyard
247388,spinnerdoc,2008-09-07 14:26:00,556,my car is pretty hot for young punks. i've had my emblegms(?) so this is not a surprise. i know about the cats my father in law is a mechanic and he has guys coming around wanting to but cats from him. they are worth some money it's got platinum plus other special metals in them
247400,jwl,2008-09-07 15:41:00,1056,"welcome to another side of salmon season.  ..happens to guys around the Niagara all the time this time of year, specially in a couple places they know you have to park at the top of the gorge and walk down.  People's windows have been smashed, items stolen from inside vehicles,tires slashed..last year someone even had the lug nuts loosened on thier boat trailer while they where on the water. What is with this time of year???"

247423,fishing n autograph,2008-09-07 17:12:00,2540,"Big thing right now continues to be the airbags out of your cars....as well as the tailgates from ford pick up trucks.  also, if you have an old junker, you could find it gone for scrap!"
247447,fishindevil,2008-09-07 19:15:00,6254,"Well about 4 weeks ago there was a guy and his son salmon fishing out of port darlington,and when he came back in to get his truck & trailer,the truck was parked almost behind the hotel as the regular parking lot was very full,the truck was left sitting on some kind of blocks !!!!  his 4 mag wheels & rims were stolen right there !!!!as well they did lots of damage to the underside,as it was left only being supportted on one side !!!!i could not believe my ears,as there is always people around there night & daybut it shows it can happen anywhere,fishermen have been targets many times as people know they are out fishing,especially down small dirt roads up north,it bothers me all the time i have to launch in those places,so far i have not been targeted,but i hope the damage wasnt too bad to your bumper...it sure pisses you off doesnt it???"
247449,jwl,2008-09-07 19:26:00,1056,"it's reasons like this at a couple places people actually park thier vehicles and boat trailers in places they run the risk of getting a parking ticket as opposed to leaving them where you are supposed to park, I guess to some the parking ticket is alot cheaper then the damage sustained by a busted window or your trailer wheel coming off on the way home...and in a round about way, a little bit of assurance that there will be police around checking up on things"
247517,CLofchik,2008-09-08 00:20:00,854,"The absolute lowest level of despicable behaviour was reached last year off Bronte.  A father was out with his son for some salmon fishing, and unfortunately had a fatal heart attack out on the pier.  That was bad enough, but while his son was desparately trying to perform CPR waiting for the paramedics to arrive, the absolutely lowest of the low scumbag punk that was fishing next to them reeled the fathers fairly high value rod and took off with it and put it in his trunk.  To beat it all, the scumbag punk then tried to go back to fishing.  Once the cops showed up more than a few on the pier pointed him out, cops found the rod in the trunk, turns out this tool was on probation for burglary & other assorted charges and promptly had his butt breached back to the back of a patrol car.  As the topper, his white trash g/f was driving around fishing with a suspended license and no insurance so she had a her car towed and had to hump her butt back to Waterloo.   You simply can't make up some of the crap that comes out during the salmon run!  http://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/257050"

247564,spinnerdoc,2008-09-08 02:57:00,556,damage was npt too bad but the fact that i almost lost lost a bumper bugged me for a bit but i didn't let it get to me. i am over it now.  i was at angling specialties  and the owner told me about the story of the guy who died who happened to be a customer of his. well he's quite a lowlife that one
247656,Reef Runner,2008-09-08 15:38:00,980,"Geez, all these stories are just horrendous.  Stealing a bumper is one of he most idiotic things I've heard.  I fish at Port Credit, if you dont mind, which parking lot was it?  Thanks for the heads up.  After my car was broken into this year, I take everything out of my car everytime I lock it up.  It's a pain in the donkey everynight, but at least I can sleep easy."
247676,bassjnkie,2008-09-08 16:20:00,1101,"My car got broken into at Petro Park, about 6-7years ago, they took everything plus my emergency ciggs. The insurance paid for everything. My Ford Escort was stripped when I go back, all that was left was a coat hanger in the window.  Sorry to hear what happened, and yes it really sucks  Daniel"
247797,spinnerdoc,2008-09-08 23:08:00,556,"reefrunner, it happened at the mouth ...i dunno the name of the street but the street where starbucks is...i parked right infront of the board walk"
247957,Reef Runner,2008-09-09 15:21:00,980,"Dang.  I park there as well, or now I'll say used to.  I just started this salmon thing, I can see how alot of people get turned off by incidents like these."
247997,Ramble,2008-09-09 17:48:00,713,"Might as well clean out the car and leave the windows down and doors unlocked. Save the hassel of gettin the car demolished by the local ""thugery"". Some caring sole once helped me  empty my gas tank while I was fishing. Almost didnt make it to the gas station. Thank the lord i was parked at an angle.  -R-"
248006,addy79,2008-09-09 18:15:00,573,no kidding...all that traffic and that managed to happen? wow
