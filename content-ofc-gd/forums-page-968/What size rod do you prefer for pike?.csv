247884,sharper,2008-09-09 03:13:00,279,I like to use a MH compre with 14lb braid.
247905,jace,2008-09-09 08:56:00,472,"In my opinion, the rod used for pike fishing depends entirely on the baits you're using.   If the rod can easily cast what you're tying on, the rod is good.  Pike aren't running fighters, it's all surge and stop so you can bring in any pike with relatively light line and gear, compared to larger salmon, except pinks.   I fished pike more than anything else in my younger years, typically using a ~10# Medium power Medium taper rod and usually used 8-10# mono line, and never felt overpowered."
247952,FishHeadRic,2008-09-09 14:34:00,226,"Where do you plan to use this new rod?  If from shore or boat and are you planning on casting long distances? What reel do you have for this rod, size? 20, 30, 40? Why don't you use leaders? Expensive habit! Lures are a lot of money after time. Not using leaders will end up killing a lot of fish.   FHR"
248122,Breach,2008-09-10 01:38:00,25,"  Shore, I dont have a boat.  I ended up with a 6'6 med heavy, I couldnt find any 7 footers in MH and also a 2 piece in stock at any of the places I went.  I do use leaders, I think it was someone else that said they dont"
247351,Breach,2008-09-07 12:01:00,25,"I have a nice 6 footer that I really like, but I was thinking of picking up a stiffer 7 footer with a fast tip for pike.  Ugly sticks any good?  Dont need anything great, already got a reel.  A lot of people say baitcasters, but Im atrocious with one."
247352,Mike the Pike,2008-09-07 12:09:00,3421,7ft medium heavy.
247355,Breach,2008-09-07 12:18:00,25,What kind of line are you using regularly?
247361,Bly,2008-09-07 12:33:00,1556,"Welcome back to fishing and welcome to OFC.   I do not fish for pike often but concur with Mike's suggestion, 7ft Medium.  If storage and travel is not an issue, go for a one piece.   Line...  I prefer 30 lb braid and a leader, I like the slightly larger diameter of the 30 vs 20, doesn't seem to cut into the spool as much."
247362,Mike the Pike,2008-09-07 12:39:00,3421,Bly I said medium heavy but like you I use 30 lb braid (Stren Super Braid 9lb diameter)  I hate to use leaders sometimes I get lucky the pike hooked deep but the braid is freyed but does not always get cut if that was mono say good bye to the fish .  Oh and Bly uses a fish magnet there is also one vey lucky horshoe in her tackle box.  Yes I am jealous because I haven't caught my first Muskie yet
247368,bigugli,2008-09-07 13:36:00,6138,The 6 ft Ugly Stick will do just fine for bigger pike. I only use 14-20lb lines and no leader.
247371,modny,2008-09-07 13:44:00,502,i prefer ice fishing rods.
247390,Bly,2008-09-07 14:38:00,1556,"  Sorry about that Mike, meant to type medium heavy     The leader, well a girl has to hide the fish magnet somewhere  LOL"
247393,mistyjr1,2008-09-07 15:01:00,97,"I bought this rod at the spring fishing show and it is awesome for pike. It is not the cheapest rod but if you are not in a big hurry you can wait until the spring sale and get it for 30$ off. I recommend the BPS XTREME I got the 7'6"" medium-heavy extra fast tip. If you have never used a 7'6"" rod you will notice that you get much farther casting distance. The handle type would be personal preference.  If you already have a reel I would buy some 50lb Power Pro.  Hope this helps, Corey"
247420,bassmaster4,2008-09-07 16:54:00,801,right now im using a 6'6 medium action Daiwa D-Shock that i got for 30 bucks and its held up quite well
247441,Raf,2008-09-07 18:35:00,3495,"what kind of pike are you catching?  24"" hammer handle is a different animal from a 36""+ fish.  A 7' MH should do ya just fine.  Like Corey said the, the extra length on the 7'6"" is nice provided you have a way of transporting it (unless you go 2pc)."
247446,jwl,2008-09-07 19:06:00,1056,"my go to everyday rod is a 7 foot med action Fenwick I have had for years,trick is have a reel with a super smooth drag. This is my favorite combo for fishing with spinner baits that are fairly light so I can still get decent casting distance,using baits like husky jerks, and for jigging pike in deeper water.   However sometimes when I know I am fishing an area that holds lots of bigger fish(average up to 3 footers with fish in the 40's possible), and for example I am using a big float/chub combo,or musky sized baits I will use my 8 footer heavy action rod. The heavier rod also comes in handy when fishing heavy weedcover to help horse the big ones out of the weeds or bring them up top really quick so there is less of a chance of them dogging it on ya into the weeds.  I probably however actually use my lighter set up alot more as come the colder months I fish a couple places where ""finesse fishing"" the pike with jigs is the most effective method to get them."
247475,BillM,2008-09-07 21:45:00,17367,"Really depends on the size of the pike, but I run a 7ft MH St.Croix along with a Shimano Calais 200 and 30lb Suffix braid.  If there is a chance I might tie into a really big fish, I'll use my '8 Shimano Compre Muskie setup along with a Abu Garcia Record60 +80lb PPro."
247478,OhioFisherman,2008-09-07 21:46:00,6623,"I have also used spinning rods for pike in the past, Raf nailed it, lighter rod might be ok for smaller fish but if you want to land them, not watch them swim away use a heavier action rod. For most pike fishing a medium heavy is ok.  Nothing wrong with ugly stick rods, not really my first choice but serviceable. I also favor a longer rod 6'6"" to 7'6"". If I am was just fishing for pike or ski`s a steel leader or maybe floro would be on."
247485,misfish,2008-09-07 21:54:00,29133,"I would not recommend the ugly stick myself. I would go with a grafite comp before going with a fibraglass rod. Med to med heavy,something with good back bone,quick tip action. Also make it a baitcast model."
247494,kemper,2008-09-07 22:49:00,2232,"Depends what size pike im expecting to trick. If its smaller pike then my 7 ft med heavy works well but if Im after early season bruisers I havent met one that could handle my 8'6"" salmon rod with a baitcaster and 30 lb PP."

247548,Breach,2008-09-08 02:01:00,25,"I actually just got an 8'6 Daiwa Salmon/Steelhead rod but was thinking that it was a bit overkill for the pike Id be going after in my lake, Lake Vernon.  Ive never hooked into any pike that was over 10-15lbs there, and I usually only have a 6 footer with me.  My current ""main"" rod is a Fenwick Canadian Methods 6 footer, light action.  I like it for the sensitivity for jigging and such, but Id never throw a big spoon on it and try to land some pike.  As for the baitcaster, I am TERRIBLE with one."
247567,mistyjr1,2008-09-08 03:09:00,97,"What kinds have you used?? I know i bought 2 and couldnt cast at all with them... if you want spinning again go with a Xtreme 7'6"" MH, and again with 50 lb pp."
247576,chickenhawk,2008-09-08 04:02:00,612,i use a medium action baitcaster rod n reel.....depends on what you are comfortable with.....
247645,Mr. Follow,2008-09-08 15:23:00,34,"Well just to add my 3 cents...(inflation it's a carp...lol) I use an Okuma 6'6"" Medium one piece with 2o lb power pro. I also have a 6'6"" Clarus Med-heavy. They are both the same feel and I've got 40"" Pike on both with no problem. Both rods are spinning. But it is all about presonal preference and feel. each of my rods were around a 100 bucks."
247655,Casey123,2008-09-08 15:37:00,461,"We bought a couple of Gary Parson one piece Medium Heavy Walleye rods, and really like them for Pike. They are a one piece with a fast tip."
247674,Reef Runner,2008-09-08 16:13:00,980,"I concur, and use, as most do here. 7 foot medium-heavy fast tip, 20# pp and a reel with a good drag system.  I would further getting a reel with decent line capacity.  You'll find this combintion will allow you to cast farther, keeping the lure in the water longer, and thus your chances of hooking into a decent pike higher"
247742,solopaddler,2008-09-08 20:27:00,8605,"I like to use 2 rods, one med/hvy baitcaster at least 7' long, and one med/hvy spinning rod both spooled with braid of some kind.  The baitcaster is the primary go to rod, the spinning rod is used to throw lighter baits, primarily salmon flutter spoons and smaller floating stickbaits. The flutter spoons kick butt, they're fantastic for working and fluttering along the top of submerged vegetation. No other spoon can do what these spoons can do pike fishing. Lot's of wicked colours that pike like as well  . It's impossible to fish these lures effectively with a baitcaster IMO, thus the need for a spinning rod."
247831,GbayGiant,2008-09-09 01:06:00,1780,"I like 7.6-8 foot bass MH flipping rods, it's always a matter of just matching the rod to the lure weight you'll be using really, but the pike in my avatar was walleye fishing with a 6' medium light jigging rod and 8lbs test last September, so if you can hook them in the corner of the lip and have your drag set good anything can do, but if your tossing 2-3oz spoons you would have to match the rod to the lures. All around I think a MH is best for average pike lures."
