247708,POLLIWOGG,2008-09-08 17:39:00,835,"Nope, they asked if everyone had their permits and of coarse they all did and the first one to produce them was charged. The CO said there was nothing stopping them from shooting a moose and tagging it if it walked out of the bush. The fact that it was against the law didn't seem to rate as a deterrent."
247714,bigfish1965,2008-09-08 17:51:00,3382,"And there was nothing stopping the CO from sexually assaulting the hunters....as the old joke goes. I find the story a bit hard to believe. First..who on earth sites in a gravel pit? Do you enjoy shrapnel ricochet? CO's don't charge you and hope you don't show up. They need their integrity intact with the JP's and if they keep bringing crap charges in, the JP is almost never going to listen to him."
247841,John Bacon,2008-09-09 01:30:00,3277," Speaking for myself; I find it very difficult not to see a difference.  If someone is transporting fish shortly after teh season closes, there is a high likelyhood that the fish were caught during the season; especially if the person is returning from trip that began prior to the close.  Contrast that with a person returning from a trip before the season opens.  Is he going to say that he caught them last and took them up to the lodge and is now bringing them back hope?  Good luck convincing the CO.  As for being unable to prove that fish being transported out of season were caught during the open season; how is that different then transporting during the open season?  You still cannot prove that they were caught during open season, they may have been caught before the season opened; especially if it is early in the season."
247948,Rich,2008-09-09 14:26:00,3927,"Technically the first day you can't legally fish trout is October 1st, so I wouldn't fret too much."
248018,Bob,2008-09-09 19:32:00,370,"You can also look at a scenario where you catch a fish in a WMU where the season is open and then to get home, you must drive through a WMU where the season is closed.  Not too often that the ministry would get a DNA test done to try to prove you caught them illegally as long as you're within the legal limit.  What about a limit from one area transported through an area where the limit is lower?  Legal nightmare for the COs and they know it."
248027,Wild,2008-09-09 20:09:00,704,Courts can and have dismissed digital images as evidence because they are so easily manipulated so keep that in mind.As far as transporting your catch you must have a reasonable amount of time to do so from point A to point B. I can't see a problem unless you commit multiple offenses  and or be a disrespectful jerk towards the conservation officer.
248073,mason05,2008-09-09 22:58:00,258,Wow guys!  Thanks for all the tips and suggestions plus the entertaining debate.  I think taking some pictures and packing the fish properly is my best bet.  I don't forsee coming across a CO in the area I plan to travel as it's quite remote however I want to be sure I'm following the rules and in this instance there appears to be a grey area within the regs.  Thanks again.  Corn Nug
247629,bigfish1965,2008-09-08 14:15:00,3382,"Let's get this straight. No matter the crime, reverse onus of proof is extremely rare. Possession of OOS fish is dependant on the day caught. It is not uncommon at all for people to fish closing dates. An arresting officer would have have to prove you committed an offense. There is no exception except for cases of intention to sell where amounts of fish make it likely that it could not be for personal use. People have fish in their freezer that were caught in season and stay beyond close all the time. Possession laws have to be read from the original source and not the summaries to make more sense.  There are possession regs, catching regs and combination of possession/catching regs. It would be illegal to catch and retain an OOS fish. If you are staying at a place and your stay encompasses the closing date, it is not an unreasonable possibility that you caught the fish prior to closing. If you are going to a buddies place for dinner in December, and you take some filets from September, it is also not an unreasonable possibility. Don't always rely on the summary of regulations as the actual written law. It is a conglomeration of provincial and federal laws written is slightly more understandable language. Your ticket will never say ""contrary to page 4 of the summaries"", it will indicate the specific act and subsection. If we reversed this logic it would be okay to catch fish prior to the opener provided you don't leave till after the opener. We know this is not the case. Don't get yourself caught up in silly interpretations..the CO doesn't (with  the rare exception of everyones favorite northern CO who shall remain nameless .....cough...DM..cough) I've been to a few resource violation court cases and the crown and CO must have all their ducks in a row just like any other case. In fact it is probably harder to get a resource violation charge to stick than most other crimes because of legal ambiguities and the fact that JP's are very unlikely to set or go against precedence. To make your life easier, clean and freeze closing day filets right away. A fish frozen makes it a bit more obvious and places reasonable doubt in your favour."
247644,jwl,2008-09-08 15:15:00,1056,"man, I am glad that with the exception of a closed period for lakers, that I live, and fish  in a place that trout is open (browns,Steelhead) 12 months a year."
247696,POLLIWOGG,2008-09-08 17:11:00,835,They will charge you and let the judge sort it out hoping you wont show up.  The guys were sighting in the rifles in a gravel pit a couple days before the moose season opened and were charged for hunting out of season.  You think  they won't charge you if you have an out of season fish.
247698,Fisherman,2008-09-08 17:15:00,7201,"I have trouble believing that charge for that scenario, maybe discharging a weapon in a no hunt zone, (municipality or designated area)."
