247646,Casey123,2008-09-08 15:23:00,461,"As many of you know, I started a new job in September of 2007.  I was hired to open a new sales office in Burlington, Ontario.  It has been a very rewarding career move, it has also meant some sacrifices for Michelle and I; primarily our time.  We have not had a vacation in a year.  I have had to work very long hours, meaning Michelle, in addition to working a very hectic full time job, has had to do double duty at home picking up the slack.  This year we choose a lodge North on Nakina, an old CN Rail stop in about 36 miles North of Geraldton, Ontario.  We left Hamilton a little after 9:PM on August 29, 2008 and started the 1280km drive North.  Our drive was without incident, we made record time to Timmins, just over 7 hours.  Just after the 101 bypass, I saw my first Lynx, standing right out on the shoulder road.  Between Timmins and Chocrane, we also saw 5 Red Fox hunting in the long grasses at the side of the Highway.  We made a quick stop to grab a coffee in Chocrane, and made a decision to stop in Kapuskasing for breakfast.  After a nice hot breakfast at the Park Inn Motel, Michelle took over the wheel for the last 480km to O’Sullivan Rainbow lodge.  O’Sullivan Lake is a large lake, approximately 14 miles from the Southern Tip to the Northern Shore and almost 7 miles across from East to West.  The great thing about fishing this lake is that you are never more then 1000 yards from a shore line.  There are literally 100's of islands and thousands of miles of shore line to fish.  Saturday afternoon we got a little turned around, once you head out a few hundred meters from the shore, you can no longer tell what land masses are islands and what is shore line.  By Sunday we had the main body of the lake figured out and Monday we had the confidence to travel the entire lake and find our way back.    Saturday we caught several smaller walleye and pike.  It was a great introduction to the lake, in addition to the vast amount of shoreline, there are dozens on sunken islands and reefs, many coming up from 70 FOW to 10FOW in a few short meters.  Sunday was exceptionally windy, it was a little tricky keeping the boat off of the shoreline when trolling.  We did mange some bigger Walleye, including this 27"" beauty caught travelling around a wind swept point.    Our real reason for picking this lake was to target some deep water lakers. We originally planned on doing some vertical jigging, we had purchased a good assortment of jigs from 3/4 oz Swedish Pimples to 3oz Cast Masters (Locating these took a little research).  A last minute trip to J.B.'s in Toronto changed all of this.  The young guy at J.B.'s showed me a a different kind of weight called a Torpedo.  It is used with a 3 way swivel and has a chart that corresponds to the speed of trolling and depth of your lure.  We used primarily silver, gold and 1/2 Williams Wobbler's; from 3"" to 6"" in size.  The results were immediate.          The scenery on the lake was breath taking, Michelle took some great pictures of the many rock formations along the shoreline.         We found the the area much different then the Chapleau region that we normally fish.  There were not many towering White Pines, the trees were primary Black Spruce and Jack Pines.  Every where we pulled up on shore, we found 1' + of moss and many species of Fungi and Lichens that we were not use to seeing a little further South.        By the end of the week, we had caught and released over 25 Lake Trout, countless Walleye and Pike.    We will be returning next year, and give a ringing endorsement to this piece of heaven that Bob and Michelle own.        O'Sullivan's Rainbow Lodge Summer  (807) 329-5297 P.O.
