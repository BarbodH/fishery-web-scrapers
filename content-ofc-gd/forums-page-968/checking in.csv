247123,PatrickGG,2008-09-06 12:58:00,562,"SUP Lucid? Good to see your doing good, Can't wait to see your season report."
247294,snag,2008-09-07 01:24:00,1932,"Hey Doug,  Does my Sis' know you are here?  The only reason she keeps you on a short leash is because you gnawed through the anklets.  You'll be pleased to know that Dad sold the shot gun after the wedding.   Hey!!  Triplets that all look like Fidel?? Wats up wid dat!!!!   Thanks for keeping your account alive,  Now show us the money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (better be plenty of vertical thumbs and a wet smoke in your lips!!)  "

247951,highdrifter,2008-09-09 14:30:00,2534," We were supposed to hit the lake this morning...  My guess is he's still shnoozing..  He's likely to re-emerge again sometime next year..  Doug's had a banner smallie season though!  Sorry Doug, I gotta do it...  AAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYEE    HD"
247965,Spiel,2008-09-09 15:49:00,9065," ....Well there's nothing wrong with that, is there? Perhaps you could drag his sorry ass up to Lakair Fidel? Then he could show me how to wrestle them smallies out of the west arm."
247976,Carp,2008-09-09 16:22:00,1488,Nice to hear from you dude.
