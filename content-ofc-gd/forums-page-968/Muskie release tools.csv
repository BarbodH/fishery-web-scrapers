247428,Pigeontroller,2008-09-07 17:36:00,2793,"I'm usually one of the guys that promote having proper release tools when Muskie fishing, so when I looked back and saw the back of my boat while fishing solo Labour day weekend I though this would be a good picture to post! I can't stress enough how important a quality landing net is! There are other ways of landing Muskie but for the in-experienced its the only way! Everyone probably has long nose pliers but HOOK CUTTERS are so important! You can buy the best and spend $60+ on Knipex, but a cheaper alternative is Candian tires mini-bolt cutters for $20.  "
247432,SlowPoke,2008-09-07 17:51:00,2984,I bought a pair of mini bolt cutters from Princess Auto for less than $10 on sale and they cut through the shank of 6/0 treble hooks with ease. At that price there is no excuse not to have them. -Brian
247437,tjsa,2008-09-07 18:19:00,1578," I was running all around Thunder Bay this past summer to all kinds of shops for work related reasons. One place I went into, I saw Knipex cutters(made mental note).  Got the opportunity to go to LOTW's this summer, so off I went back to this shop. About $37.00 for the Knipex cutters. I didn't need them in the end, although I did catch my first Musky.  Apparently the electrician guys love these pliers. They rarely come back to buy new ones because they hold an edge so well."
247440,Raf,2008-09-07 18:33:00,3495, That is a steal and these cutters will last you a long time.  As SlowPoke mentioend you can get decent ones at princess auto or crappy tire but eventually they will give up the ghost.  I had a tough time cutting through 7/0 trebles with the mini cutters from CT.
247443,SlowPoke,2008-09-07 18:45:00,2984," Yup, be prepared to replace them when the blades start to look like a crimping tool"
247486,Wild,2008-09-07 22:02:00,704,CTC and PA do have a lifetime warranty... well unless you drop them overboard What about surgical tools? I have a doctor's appointment next week so is there anything I should  inquire about?
247536,mistyriver1,2008-09-08 01:24:00,600,"Yep, I started out with those CTC's as well Dax, but upgraded to the Knipex.  The knipex are excellent.  Saves precious time to get the fish back in the water."
247550,tjsa,2008-09-08 02:02:00,1578," I don't know about the ""steal"", but these are the ones I bought. And I found the receipt, $33.97 for them. About 8 inches long, good grips on them. Are they the ones people uses for Musky?????  "
247612,Raf,2008-09-08 12:51:00,3495,Tom if they look like this than yes.. I can't see your pic.    They are usually at least $60.
247632,mattyk,2008-09-08 14:31:00,2110,I got my knipex online for $35U.S. at Chads toolbox. Good selection of knipex cutters.  http://chadstoolbox.com/
247681,bassjnkie,2008-09-08 16:26:00,1101,"Reading the posts, I think I have to invest in better release tools.  Thanks Daniel"
247694,Slimeball,2008-09-08 17:05:00,30,"tjsa, Those are Knipex side/diagnal cutters, they will work for the light stuff but you will have problems down the road cutting 5/0 - 8/0. The ones Raf have pictured are the mini bolt musky anglers use.  My boat will never be without one of these either http://hookpick.com"
