247856,PERCHER,2008-09-09 02:03:00,787,"Nice fish Buddy.And add another 43"" for Catch 22.Way to go."
247857,Joey,2008-09-09 02:05:00,9122,"Very nice fish Shawn.  Jeez, you're just hoisting it up like its nothing, I need to work out more  Joey"
247863,jwl,2008-09-09 02:16:00,1056,"nice going on the fish, they get real scrappy when they start to get into the 40's,looks like you had some ideal weather too..can't ask for much more than that"
247865,Pigeontroller,2008-09-09 02:19:00,2793,BOO   to the vertical hold Sean!
247876,GbayGiant,2008-09-09 02:49:00,1780,"Nice fish Shawn, your getting lot's of big ones this year gotta love those big surprises. I already got us a 46"" for Catch 22 put up a couple weeks ago and added a 19"" smallie yesterday, we got a good average but really need a catfish and carp and non great lakes trout if anyone can go for them. If you go to the bottom of the page and click on Tourney Entries all our pics are in there, been updating whenever possible.  My first musky ever was walleye fishing with a worm harness as well. I think if we made a monster worm harness with a #10 Colorado blade, size 7 hooks tipped with a big Gardner snake it could be deadly all year, lol."
247879,bassboy,2008-09-09 03:00:00,161,Awesome fish Shawn.......all of them!   I cant believe you got the musky on a worm harness!!!  WTG!  Bill
247887,sharper,2008-09-09 03:15:00,279,Great catch! I still haven't manage to catch my musky this year yet.
247888,snag,2008-09-09 03:19:00,1932,"Congrats,  That's a beauty.  The vertical will cause some grief (pssst hold the sign in yer teeth!!).  8lb. line!!!  Amazing."
247902,lew,2008-09-09 07:22:00,12767,"WTG Shawn, some real real nice fish there."
247912,b2kptbo,2008-09-09 11:48:00,1505,"Have had Muskie take my worm harness and what a ride. Thats a nice one you got, couple good bass as well, WTG..."
247914,Roy,2008-09-09 11:52:00,13728,"Great fish and excellent photos, Shawn. Good on ya."

247956,Reef Runner,2008-09-09 15:14:00,980,"Great catch, and on 8lb mono to boot.  My first musky was also caught walleye fishing. Hope you got a flak jacket for the vert hold, these musky guyz are gonna be foaming at the mouth.  I figure you for a great angler, I'm sure she swam off nicely."
247958,1leggedangler,2008-09-09 15:31:00,364,"Awesome job!! Thanks for the report and pics.  Cheers, 1leg"

248038,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-09-09 20:42:00,0,Nice Musky and some decent smallies!!! More muskies are caught on pickerel and bass gear than musky gear!
