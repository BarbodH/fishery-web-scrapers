247501,Terry,2008-09-07 23:30:00,14456,"well ,muskymatt  started a thread and said memart won 2 days Ottawa river muskie outing  memarts brother said he had a fishing tourney that weekend and couldn't go so I got asked to go..cool..you bet I will  took Friday off work and off we go to ottawa, memart towed his boat so we could do some fishing on Friday when we got there we picked up some bass and pike and perch..    met up with Matt, went out for a meal and made plans for the next days fishing ,then got to the motel some some much needed sleep  out at six am and not off the water till after 8 pm, these boys are hard core fishermen  thought this thing had to be a muskie, it took a great big top water bait ,real nice bass..I am told muskie fishermen call them bait..still looked big to me      Matt had a fat muskie on, but it got off, some people say if the net boy was quicker,it would be one in the boat, but I wouldn't be one of them to say that  work the water again sunday till noon then home we go  I gained a lot of  knowledge about  muskie fishing and have a lot of new tips and fishing techniques to try  Matt did a great job and it was a great prize and fantastic trip memart is a great guy to fish with and I can't thank him enough for taking me on the trip and we all had fun joking around and spending time on the water.....I hope to fish the mighty Ottawa again soon       if your squirrel is near the water, please make it wear a life jacket"

247523,muskymatt,2008-09-08 00:53:00,2608,"Great to have you guys in Terry and Rob..it was a pleasure.  We fished hard and when it all came down to the biggie....someone didn't set the hook hard enough  ..but we got a look...a good look at a big fish  Hope to see you guys around here again sometime for another kick at it..  We had some good laughs , freeky weather and a bit of action....it was a blast.  Anytime....  M.  Hey Robert...we can't be too hard on the net man , the handle was about 10' too short and I think he was distracted by the squirrel without it's life jacket...lol"
