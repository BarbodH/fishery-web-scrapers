247348,Breach,2008-09-07 11:56:00,25,"As Im just getting back into the sport, I dont know if this is a good deal or nor, but Canadian Tire had Plano Soft Sided bags for $12.99, one of these ones  "
247350,Roy,2008-09-07 11:58:00,13728,"Yes, it's a good deal and welcome back."
247353,Mike the Pike,2008-09-07 12:14:00,3421,Yes it is a good deal usually sells for $19.99  
247358,ccmtcanada,2008-09-07 12:23:00,7971,I have 3 of these....the trays alone are worth the 12.99.
247372,bbog,2008-09-07 13:46:00,665,I buy them for the trays and put the bag to another use - like housing my portable fish finder.
247374,hammercarp,2008-09-07 13:54:00,964,It's a good deal that they run periodically. I bought one a while ago and use it.
247379,Grimace,2008-09-07 14:08:00,2020,Thanks Breach.    I am going to go grab one right now.
247389,wallyboss,2008-09-07 14:36:00,1095,2 summers ago the cashier at CTC looked at me a bit crooked when I showed up at her cash with 15 of them.  It was a good deal for the trays for sure.  I still have empty bags for sale if anybody are interested
247407,HTHM,2008-09-07 16:11:00,4082,Jump on that deal!
247409,jwl,2008-09-07 16:18:00,1056,"hey good find thanks for the info..my tackle bag has seen many seasons and better days,time for a new one..gotta check and see if I got a flyer"
247410,SlowPoke,2008-09-07 16:22:00,2984,I didn't see it in our flyer... London area. May be worth calling the store.
247416,JohnF,2008-09-07 16:44:00,3494,"Wasn't in the Stratford flyer either, but for what it's worth the Stratford store has had packs of 4 plastic trays bundled for $9.95 for quite a while now. Having siad that I don't look every time I'm in so they may be gone but I figured why pay extra for the bag I don't need.  JF"
247418,Mike the Pike,2008-09-07 16:51:00,3421,  Grimace don't bother running down there to buy .I tried that this morning.  Got there and it was $24.99  Perhaps Cliff can tell us when it will be or was on sale.  Like Slowpoke said not in the flyer .  Breach where did you see this and when.  DO NOT GO TO CDN TIRE IT IS NOT ON SALE UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY $24.99  
247424,Grimace,2008-09-07 17:13:00,2020,I just got back.    It was 24.99.    Not the Guelph are i guess.
247425,Grimace,2008-09-07 17:14:00,2020,"Thanks for the heads up mike.   I guess i was a little quick on the draw.   hahahha.    Oh well, I like looking around in Canadian Tire anyways.   I love that store"
247474,misfish,2008-09-07 21:44:00,29133,You can save yourself alot of money by buying a fully rigged Ranger bass boat that has rod lockers and tackle compartments.HAHAHAHAHA Good deal on the back tackle box.
247488,Pigeontroller,2008-09-07 22:08:00,2793,"Thanks for the heads up! I went down to CTC to get one...weren't on sale...Looked at tires, found out that Dunlop Radial Rovers 265/70 16 were on for $144 each! And got a 9amp Dewalt reciprocating saw and case for the same price($99) as the 6.5amp one!  Thanks!"
247491,ccmtcanada,2008-09-07 22:21:00,7971,"I'll check, but I'm pretty sure they were on sale last week.  The new flyers start on Saturday, so it was likely an expired advertisement you were looking at."
247492,Wild,2008-09-07 22:33:00,704,I did not see them on sale or in this weeks flier but I did pick up the garmin GPS bundle half price and there is a 1 lux LED spotlight which works pretty well and the charge lasts up to 6 hours. Certain camping items are clearanced 3-50% off. By the way guys CT does have an online flyer and you can sign up for emails.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/home.jsp
247531,skeeter,2008-09-08 01:13:00,1907,they were on sale but that was about a month ago. i bought my son one before we went to the french river. great little bag for  him cause i opened up my bag and filled his with some of my lures. now mines is 8lbs lighter.   but Tracker still doesnt like the weight of it..
247546,Breach,2008-09-08 01:56:00,25,"I got mine two days ago at the Canadian Tire just off of Kingston Road St. Clair.  They had a whole display of the soft side ones for $12.99 and then above them they had a whole shelf of Plano soft side Guide ones which were around $30 or $40.  I dont know if it was at all the stores or not, it sounds like it wasnt.  If you're close to that store you can check it out, as I may go back tommorow and get a few more"
247549,ccmtcanada,2008-09-08 02:01:00,7971," As I mentioned before, if you got it two days ago (Friday) then that was likely the last day of the previous sale.  A new sale and flyer started on Saturday morning.  The store may have been overstocked and offered the 'sale' price on their own, so you may get lucky...it may be at the same price."
