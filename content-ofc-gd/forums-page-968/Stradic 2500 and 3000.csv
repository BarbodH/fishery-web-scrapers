247609,steverowbotham,2008-09-08 12:39:00,1800,Line capacity
247642,rhare,2008-09-08 15:10:00,387,The handle is a little different too. Bigger. But other then that it is the 2500.
247844,jrego7,2008-09-09 01:39:00,37,"At first I was looking into buying the stradic then I saw the Okuma VS and I bought that instead. 5 year warranty. Then the line lay guide broke on me and I had it sent back for repair which I should've done myself considering it would've probably been cheaper. Cost me roughly $40 to ship it to California since I couldn't get a hold of Rockies Tackle in Orillia. $150 for the reel + $40, it's becoming an expensive reel lol. I guess from not flipping the guide back over and letting it clunk weakened it :| Ya live and ya learn. the 2500 and 3000 differences are in size weight and sometimes ball bearings depending on the models you compare"
247847,Sebastian,2008-09-09 01:43:00,208,If you're interested in a 2500 then I suggest the old stradic. Japanese quality versus the new Malaysian one. Went to several stores and they feel rough right out of the box. The lower model Saros feels way better than the new Stradic. Shimano is starting to go down hill. My $0.02
247854,Garry2Rs,2008-09-09 01:56:00,1425,The point is now mute.  The reel I was looking at has been sold. The facts seem to be that the BPS catalog was wrong! There is a half ounce difference in weight. The catalog may have gone to press before the reels were actually released. The frames seem to be the same. The spool does have a smaller arbor to give you added line capacity. There may also be some other small mechanical differences. Thanks for all of your in-put guys. 2R's
