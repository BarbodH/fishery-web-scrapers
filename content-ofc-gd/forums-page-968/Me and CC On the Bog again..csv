I really need to convince the wife to get a boat with a full windshield and top, it was a cold ride out. So from the tip of the island up the Scugog River to try and recover Scott's hook and bait from two weeks ago. Not a chance but we managed about five before the rain came down and we made a bee line for home.  These are the three worth taking pictures of.         After a wet ride back we tried a few areas near the launch, had a few splashes but no luck. All were caught on either tubes or worms deep in the Lily Pads. Thank god for Power Pro.LOL  Chris"
