We diddled around on the reef for a couple of hours. My buddy had two nice fish on but couldn't get them into the boat. I grabbed this one (3 lb, 4 oz) while dragging a (pumpkinseed) tube jig, before the weather turned for the worse. The highlight of the day was meeting another OFC'r. Thanks for stopping by to say hi Lexington; it was great to meet you. Here is a snap of the one we boated. Jim "
