This is why I try and go to places where only centrepinners go but I am fortunate to live by the Niagara.  Not sure how I would have reacted to those asses."

247331,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-09-07 07:52:00,0,"Thanks for all the replies, guys and gals.  JWL, no worries, I was not upset about your post coz' I knew what you were talking about.  I just wish if there were things we could do to make every pool a better place to fish at.  Imagine if you have to take some kinda written exams to get your fishing license, maybe it would educate new anglers to know what to do and what to follow rather than causing conflicts with each other.  The world is alreadya small place filled with wars and stuff. We dont need those in fishing, dont you agree?"
