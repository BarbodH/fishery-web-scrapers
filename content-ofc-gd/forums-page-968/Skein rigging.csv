247081,GBW,2008-09-06 01:38:00,8460,I agree as I was/am in the same boat and learning as well.  So I posted what I found about it.  But now I have found a few MORE bit's of info here: sekin how to this may help some.  Thanks to all that have posted valued info in this thread too!  Cheers. Geoff
247088,hammercarp,2008-09-06 02:02:00,964,A lot of fish that are egg scatterers eat thier own eggs. In the case of salmon any eggs floating down stream have not settled onto the bottom where they need to be to hatch. So it makes sense for the fish to eat them. Better them than another fish since the eggs aren't going to hatch anyway. They do still need energy to complete their life cycle I know that in the case of the salmon here they don't reproduce sucessfully  but the same instincts still apply.
248047,hurraylien,2008-09-09 21:04:00,95,"fresh skein can be key.about 15 yr ago one of my first outings to bronte at rebecca st bridge 1st week of sept a few guys had caught a salmon and gutted it and used the fresh skein almost golf ball size chunks but used some spider wire to keep it on the hook.anyways they banged off 5 bows in a row.also in the river i,ll use a worm off the bottom non floating dont get as many bites as everybody thats floating off bottom but ninety percent of the time i get one its a female  in the mouth and they do peck at it.also in the river i stay pretty close to the bank instead of the middle of the river the fish will circle and alot hold close to the banks they have a path that the majority of fish will follow.hope this is helpful"
248118,CLofchik,2008-09-10 01:31:00,854," Every salmon I've ever kept from a river had eggs in it's gut.  Their stomachs get strange, they seem to shrink and the stomach walls get really thick once they start getting dark so I don't think they can get any nutrients out of them.  Aggression, instinct, I dunno why; I just know they'll hit properly presented eggs.   Heh, was probably me.  I used to be one of the big skein fiends down at Rebecca.  Some fun all nighters down there before the new bridge went in, used to ding all sorts down there at night, bows, some HUGE browns, even caught lakers.  I used to just dry the skein off and let it sit in the fridge on some newspaper for a day to suck up all the excess moisture (was gloriously single back then  ), then quarter it up into small hunks, douse the 3 or 4 hunks of skein with Borax (be sure to get it in all the crevices!), then into tupperware and into the freezer.  Grab one of the containers, head down to the river and use smaller scissors to cut a hunk off to fish with.  Some days they want bigger pieces, some days smaller."
246975,canadadude,2008-09-05 17:29:00,769,"My theory on why skien works so well is that the fish are teritrorial and when a bunch of eggs invades there teritory they get agressive and lash out at invading egg cluster! Skien works great for fall chinnies but it's a messy bait to deal with! I also cure it in either hot pink procure or rubby red, it's probably one of the best tactics out there for numbers of fall kings."
246980,Marko,2008-09-05 17:41:00,854,What is the difference between using a roe bag and the salmon skien??
246989,Reef Runner,2008-09-05 18:22:00,980,"My guess, Marko, is that the skein keeps it all together and its immature roe.  Whereas a roe bag is one of those mesh bags tied with mature roe.  I am by no means an expert, just an educated guess based mostly on solo's pic above.  I'm curious, back to my original post, as how to weight the skein.  I would guess starting from the rod tip -- float, 2 feet line, three-way split, a foot or so of lead with the #4 hook, and another foot or so with a 1/2 ounce egg sinker?"
246991,highdrifter,2008-09-05 18:24:00,2534," roe bags are held together with mesh and string, and skeen is held together because the eggs are not fully developped and they're still attached to the membrane...  And Canadadude... Kings are called Kings cause they can get real big, not because they have a distinguished palet..  Are there any other theories on why salmon would hit skeen?  It just boggles the mind when I think about it.  Are they that primitive?!!  Glad I could help reef, hope to cross lines witcha sometime!  HD"
247002,Reef Runner,2008-09-05 19:04:00,980,"If we're shoulder to shoulder HD, it might happen, lol.  Hope you bring an extra spool. hahaha"
247009,highdrifter,2008-09-05 19:26:00,2534," Oh and if I may add... Rig up with some strong braid like powerpro or spiderwire.  The contact with your lure is almost a %100 (for better hook-ups), it'll resist abbrasion, and you'll be able to cast further, without skimping on line strength...  And.. If your line crosses with someone using mono, guess who's gonna havta re-tie!  cheers HD"
247038,JohnF,2008-09-05 22:40:00,3494, Not hard to believe if you've raised live breeders in an aquarium. If you leave any others in with Mom they line up under her as she drops the babies to scoop 'em up before they even get opened out.  JF
247042,Canuck2fan,2008-09-05 22:54:00,1444," I have a simple theory of why salmon hit skein.... Same reason a male lion will kill any cubs with the pride when they take over. It eliminates the competition for the young he will produce. No other reason makes sense to me, since all the expert muckity mucks on here will tell you in no uncertain terms NO salmon EVER ""eats"" anything once it comes into the river....."
247044,highdrifter,2008-09-05 22:56:00,2534,"  EEEWWWW... dat's gross!!  Trials and tribulations of nature, but still disturbing."
247045,highdrifter,2008-09-05 22:58:00,2534," I've heard of male lions mauling other cubs, but eating them?   Can a fish with a wee brain be really that proactive?! LOL"
247049,bigugli,2008-09-05 23:38:00,6138," Like most important aspects in nature, feeding, breeding, surviving, are all governed by brute instinct. Kinda like teenage boys once puberty takes hold. No brains required as the hormones take over"
247052,salmon,2008-09-05 23:51:00,334,"Okay, my 2 cents River mouths: Cleos, crocodiles and larger x-raps (3/4 oz): Equipment St. Croix Avid 9 1/2 ft baitcasting rod and 300 Curado. 30 lb braid, my battles do not last more than 5 minutes. I do not like waiting 10 - 15 minutes for another pesron using lighter gear holding up everyone else. In the river, you will not see me until October thru December, when the circus ends. I have seen enough of it the past years. Floatfishing: Single or double Extrude eggs (plastic) works like a charm on those rainbows.  Jose"
