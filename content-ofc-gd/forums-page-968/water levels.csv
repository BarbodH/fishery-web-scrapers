248020,Reef Runner,2008-09-09 19:53:00,980,"Hello there and welcome to the board.  Give us a little info about yourself, just a short intro, be sure to include why you love the sport.  You may have better luck in getting the advice you seek  Cant say about Bronte, but I can tell you water levels in the Credit are higher."
