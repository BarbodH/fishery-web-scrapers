264635,irishfield,2008-11-04 19:14:00,26272,And when are you gonna paint that dang sign....  ....and can you keep the darn vehicles off your runway.... so that I can come in and drink your Vodka!!  
264636,lew,2008-11-04 19:18:00,12767,I drove by that sign 3 times this year Wayne and kinda wish I was heading up that way again right about now.
264637,irishfield,2008-11-04 19:22:00,26272,I tried to get to camp today as I forgot some stuff... I was over it... but never saw it. Had to turn around and come back. Everything North of Sturgeon Falls socked in solid with fog.  It's pretty... but it ain't fun...
264644,Roy,2008-11-04 19:41:00,13728,Methinks TJ is being stalked aerially.
264646,irishfield,2008-11-04 19:44:00,26272,Figured I may as well do something while I waited for the fog to hopefully dissipate.   I guess being stocked aerially... is a lot better than anally!
264648,e-z-out,2008-11-04 19:45:00,1052, Me thinks Roy wants a stalker as well lol
264701,TJQ,2008-11-04 23:13:00,7806,Thats was you??   lol.. I went outside and said what is wrong with that dude.. lol...   i waved....  lol  I thought it was the revenuers lookin' for me still.
264718,irishfield,2008-11-05 00:07:00,26272,I saw where your crop grows though..... LOL
264732,Wild,2008-11-05 01:15:00,704,  You could have been thoughtful enough to drop a care package Wayne! 
264734,irishfield,2008-11-05 01:18:00,26272,If I had of circled one more time I just might have.....as today was the closest I ever came to hurling in an airplane. Saying it was a tad turbulent up there today doesn't even come close.
264737,sturgman,2008-11-05 01:29:00,249,"TJ is way too humble.. The OFC sign was replaced this summer.. Guess the fog got in the way, it looks awesome!! If your ever up that way again Wayne I would love to see an arial pic of Bain lake where my cottage is, only minutes north of the Quesnel's.... I have the last cottage on the south end of the lake.."
264738,irishfield,2008-11-05 01:35:00,26272,See what I can do Sturgman..... I usually track right over Garden Village but no big deal to be 4 or 5 miles off to the west on my way to Temagami. Doubt it will happen again this year..... today was probably the last attempt to go up. Looked like a great day but the fog Gods had other ideas. I wanted to get my stuff that I left behind at camp and then go fish a lake NE of Temagami for rainbows before coming back home late today. Instead I just burned 35 gallons of fuel...churned my stomach and left ruts in my soft grass runway that I now have to go out and roll out tomorrow.
264893,fishnsled,2008-11-05 19:02:00,3520,"First you steal his beer and now you are looking for the hard stuff.  Oh well, what are friends for.  I grabbed this shot in August when I was by.  The sign does look awesome.  "
265414,Clampet,2008-11-07 12:45:00,1947,"Is this you coming in fer a landing, Irish?  "
265432,irishfield,2008-11-07 14:15:00,26272,Na... but I might have been on it depending what year that was! LOL  That's St. Marten.
265474,SlowPoke,2008-11-07 18:51:00,2984, Nice shot FnS. Muskiestudd and I are still waiting for Bassmastermike to send us shots from June with the old sign (among other photos). That boy likes his gadgets but someone needs to show him how to use email!!  -Brian
265478,Pachone,2008-11-07 19:28:00,276,Whoa  Irishfield u got some skills LOL!
