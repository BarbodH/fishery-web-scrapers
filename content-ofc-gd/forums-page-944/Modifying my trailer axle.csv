Thought it would be great to keep the boat in the garage especially in the fall and also a great spot to store it over the winter. Only problem the doors are about 5"" too narrow.  My Galvanized Easy loader trailer actually seems a bit over sized for my 1775 Lund Classic .the fenders have about 4"" of clearance to the rail of the trailer and the outside face of the tires are easily 12"" from the edge of the boat.  I was thinking why not remove the axle assembly cut about a 6"" section out of the centre of the axle , reinforce and weld and ,,presto a new slightly narrower trailer.  Other than the welding part , should be able to handle the rest in the driveway.  Now just gotta clean out the garage  Appreciate your comments.  TB"
265382,irishfield,2008-11-07 04:00:00,26272,Dave.. call Bay distributors in North Bay and see if they have a narrow axle assembly. They built the trailer.. they'd know.  705-476-6010... ask for George..he's' the service manager. He may very well pass you off to someone else.. but a least a place to start.  As for cutting/welding... I'd have to see it first. Spring mount perches etc may be an issue to move the axle in on each side by 3 inches  George's email is [email protected] and their company website email is [email protected]  http://bwmarineproducts.com/easyhaul.htm
