Started late as my son for the first time ever changed his mind in the last moment and refused coming with me  So there I go alone...started fishing close to 9am in 240 fow...and moving deep...I was getting fish every 15 min....7-10 Lbs each...not bad ...fog was thicker than cheese....couldn't see the fish when fighting it behind the boat...what did people do before the GPS age?!?  Got 4-5 in a raw and it died...kept moving deep and even deeper...got to 370.....NADA...hmmmm.....turned around...got to about 345 and man oh man....fire storm started... and only good size ones too....mid teens ...lost a huge one...must have been close to 20 Lbs after it went 5 times under the boat finally got my line into the prop  ;D  Lost track of how many times I had to replace that particular lure this season...JB Fishing Depot here I come again tomorrow for bunch more....  :-[ :'(  Amazing fight from all fish today though...unbelievable how those fish fight at this time of the year....waoooooooooooooo.....larger fish in the summer don’t fight as good...TONS of fun for sure today....  Lake was almost like a mirror at the end and small chop earlier - perfect conditions ...just the fog...couldn’t see the sun all morning....  Had to leave by Noon in the midst of all the action...  Final score....I think ....12 hooked....just one (the big one) lost....kept 4 for the BBQ and let the rest go....hope to fight them again when they get bigger  Tech data:  3 mph, 240 to 370 fow, 55-60 feet down, Michael Jackson and Green/Black NK 28. Only run two rods as I was alone but still got plenty of action. All Kings today...after getting tons of bows during the season couldn't find a single bow today  Such fun in November....can't beat it....who knows may even try again next week.  By the way....if others are launching there - most docks are taken out at Port Credit. The worst ones are still there...  Few shots from the day:      Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
