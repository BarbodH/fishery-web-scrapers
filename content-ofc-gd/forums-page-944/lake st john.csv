265481,Gerritt,2008-11-07 19:51:00,6129,"Yes you can fish it at night provided your vessel has the appropriate light requirements.. and as for what to use? well, what are you targeting?  G"
265484,misfish,2008-11-07 20:53:00,29133,"G, If I were there fishing the night time hours,I be targeting the crappie.The odd eye aswell.  I STILL WONT EAT ANYTHING FROM THERE.   This is just MO,so dont get on me."
265498,bigredfisher,2008-11-07 22:58:00,300,i was gonna go for eyes in a canoe how would that be i also have a motor for my canoe
265506,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-07 23:25:00,2050,"Can't help you on the walleye front, I've only fished bass in St. John, but if I were you I would listen to Gerritt adn stay away from the lake at night if you don't have lights on your canoe...it's a popular tourney bass angler lake and I wouldn't want to get run over by a bass boat going 70mph across the lake! lol  good luck, UF"
265507,misfish,2008-11-07 23:32:00,29133,  Not sure I would agree on that. Cant see to many tourney guys being out there at dark concidering they fish the first 8 hrs of day light. I be more worried about some local zippen around.
265510,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-07 23:39:00,2050, Point is I don't want the guy to get run over...
265513,misfish,2008-11-07 23:48:00,29133,Point taken.
265514,mbac31,2008-11-07 23:48:00,904,"I fish that lake quite often and have not seen a tourney there as of yet unless its a local small one. By the time your 70mph boat gets on full plane you are at the other side allready. You can fish it at night and you will be safe. My boat does go that fast but not at night.  Still I would not want to hit anyone with no lights. Play it safe.  Most tourney guys have boats put away. Make sure you have lights though, no matter if its a canoe or not. I will be there Sunday all day fishin for walters and crappie."
265578,The Urban Fisherman,2008-11-08 05:34:00,2050," dude, I know tourney guys who fish that lake on a weekly basis, right up until there's ice on the lake... And most of them certainly don't have their boats put away.  They just head south as the lakes freeze over.  Maybe the recreational guys have their boats put away, but not the hard-core dudes.  As for tourney's, yeah they're usually smaller club tournaments, but the lake does get pounded with them in the summer.  Regardless of all this, I wasn't necessarily trying to say the guy was going to get run over @ 70MPH, it was more of a joke - didn't expect everybody to take it literally, but common sense says (in my opinion) that you don't go out on a lake in the dark without lights on your boat.  Especially in a canoe!  Cheers, UF"
265585,bigugli,2008-11-08 06:05:00,6138,"The law is very specific. You must have running lights to be on the water at night.  Years back we spent a long night trolling for the bodies of 2 anglers who got creamed. They did not have any running lights and there was no moon. One fella was found alive in the water, the other was found washed up dead on the shore the next morning.  Better safe than sorry."
265643,Gerritt,2008-11-08 19:21:00,6129,Especially on a lake that has an airport... if you are without lights at night you are certainly foolish. besides it is the law.  Having spent most of my summers on that body of water I have seen my share of accidents.. (Usually planes however)  G
265653,irishfield,2008-11-08 20:11:00,26272,DANG Gerritt.... we don't fly THAT low ! LOL  Oh and float plane ops are illegal 30 minutes after sunset. (not to say they don't go on! LOL)
