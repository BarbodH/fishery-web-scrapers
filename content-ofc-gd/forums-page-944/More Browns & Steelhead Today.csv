Next to the 3rd swivel is connected a piece of surgical tube (attached with a piece of wire (copper fly tying wire in the thicker sizes works well Or bell wire with the cover removed.)) .  Slide a piece of pencil lead into the tubing.  This Artists Rendering should help.  "
265273,solopaddler,2008-11-06 23:55:00,8605," Thanks Dave, perfect diagram!"
265275,StoneFly,2008-11-07 00:12:00,574,Pencil lead weight?  cant a bell sinker clipped on be used?  how heavy?
265282,solopaddler,2008-11-07 00:33:00,8605," That's the thing, you can cut the lead into various lengths depending on water speed/depth. Exact weight is a guess as you're cutting chunks of it off a long roll..."
265295,irishfield,2008-11-07 01:05:00,26272,Pencil lead also walks over rocks where a bell sinker is more liable to get snagged.
264858,solopaddler,2008-11-05 17:01:00,8605,"As a lot of you guys know I just moved to Grimsby last summer. I think I'm starting to like it even more than I already do It sure is nice to have a spot to fish close to home.  Anyhow, I headed out again this morning and managed a bunch more fish. Surprisingly all the browns were males (at least the ones that I caught). Bottom bouncing in the heavy current takes a bit of feel, and you've got to get the amount of lead just right. Too little and you're not reaching the fish. Too much and you're constantly getting hung up. When you've got it just right you can feel your pencil lead ticking bottom lightly... Sometimes the hits are very light, this morning most of the hits were savage...lots-o-fun!  Here's the pic's I did manage to get. Admitedly the shots of the fish laying on the pier aren't exactly aesthetically pleasing, but whatya you gonna do? The steelhead was mint, very chromy and quite acrobatic.         Now it's off to work. On tap for today: tying a bunch of roe bags for Friday  .  Cheers,  Mike"
264859,limeyangler,2008-11-05 17:04:00,5204,thats just great! your absolutely haulin' 'em out at the moment Solo....keep up the good work.
264860,wuchikubo,2008-11-05 17:06:00,1114,"WTG Mike, I'm wishing I lived closer to good fishing waters after seeing your recent reports.  Then again, working 6 days a week would be even more torture that way.  Keep them reports coming!! Stan"
264867,SNAGKING,2008-11-05 17:29:00,43,"Great report, it's weird seeing your reports not from a river."
264872,ccmtcanada,2008-11-05 18:22:00,7971,Jeez...have you got nothing better to do every day then fish?  Wait...I take that back!  Great stuff Mike...I've never tried bottom bouncing for them before...care to be a teacher to a student willing to learn yet again???  First it was float fishing...then trolling worm harnesses...then onto jigging techniques...may as well add bottom bouncing to the list!!!  At least I pay attention and retain a lot of what I hear!!!
264898,solopaddler,2008-11-05 19:25:00,8605," You're a sponge Cliff!  (You're welcome to fish with me anytime, you know that.)"
264899,kemper,2008-11-05 19:34:00,2232,"im home all weekend cliff and will be doing some bottom bouncing myself, I have everything if you are looking for a fishin partner  and solo, great fishin"
264900,Pachone,2008-11-05 19:45:00,276,"Hey Solo...  What are you ""bottom bouncing"" with... and how? Whats the bait?  .... unless its a secret... LOL!  Great report by the way!... u really inspire! getting into the art of the centre pin"
264901,KelfuN,2008-11-05 19:54:00,246,"nice catch, im liking the chrome very much.  your catching fish anywhere you go, maybe next time i'll just follow you to whereever you go..lol"
264905,solopaddler,2008-11-05 20:03:00,8605," 13' Rainshadow float blank rated 6-10 built into a spinning rod. (My bottom bouncing machine) Spinning reel loaded with 15lb Power Pro tied to a 3-way swivel. Chunk of surgical tubing lashed to the bottom swivel with a piece of pencil lead shoved into it. Tippet length varied from 2-5'. Down there fluoro tippet is a recipe for trouble 'cause it gets so abraded from the zebra mussels. Because of that I use 6lb Maxima Ultragreen. #12 Kamasan sedge hook and nickel to quarter sized roe bags tied in charteuse with no floaters in them (although sac's with floaters would've likely worked even better).  Cast across and slightly upstream, close your bail and let your bait swing past and below you ticking bottom all the way. As mentioned strikes are usually obvious."
264934,kemper,2008-11-05 22:05:00,2232,"Man up solo, I bottom bounce with my pin!   okay not usually, but I have done it on occasion with the same results as a spinner"
264938,solopaddler,2008-11-05 22:14:00,8605," Maybe east of T.O. .... Bigger rivers it's not easy to cast as far as you can with a spinning reel (without sidecasting and putting horrendous twist in your line). Plus the braid is key. Unless you run it on your pin which I wouldn't recommend (it freezes), you're at a disadvantage. You feel everything with braid."
264964,trophypikehunter,2008-11-05 23:38:00,89,"Great catch!!!  I'll be down to port D this weekend to bottom bounce, love the feeling when the weight ticks bottom I live 2 mins for Lake Simcoe but was born and raised in St.kittys and the parents still have a room for me.....the best of both worlds......."
264966,Marko,2008-11-05 23:41:00,854,"Great fish Solo, another nice outing. Question for experts, is there a difference in hits when you are using roe and worms. I fished for browns ( bottom bouncing ) using worms before, and its fairly tricky with rocky bottom when your weight is bouncing off rocks it can feel like  fish hits. Now would it feel any different on your finger when you are using roe, like couple of small hits or one big one? If i am not making any sense i am sorry lol"
264968,kemper,2008-11-05 23:45:00,2232,"  I was just pokin fun, spinning is definatly at the advantage. I actually am in the works of building a bouncin only set up.  I find my 13'6"" a little too whippy, kinda like casting a sunfish on a hook into the wind with a 13 foot piece of spaghetti."
264973,solopaddler,2008-11-06 00:06:00,8605, Sorry that went right over my head  . (sounds like we're on the same wavelength)
264977,BillM,2008-11-06 00:12:00,17367,So anyone braving the rain this weekend?  Or should I just stay inside? lol
264978,fishindevil,2008-11-06 00:15:00,6254,"Some very nice fish there mike !!!.  .man you have sure been doing a number on them fish this fall !!! welkl done bud...nice colors on them browns,  cheers"
264981,kemper,2008-11-06 00:20:00,2232, You can bet ill be out all weekend.  Actually Ill probably be bouncin' because the rivers have got to be gin at the moment
264986,BillM,2008-11-06 00:25:00,17367,"Kemper, so bouncing will be a good plan this weekend instead of a float?  If you need some company let me know, I'll most likely be out by myself as well."
265067,tributaryhunter,2008-11-06 04:53:00,108,"some nice fish solo, i was there sat nite landed 6 all male browns, it's only going to get better soon, nice steelie though, once the fish are in thick its not hard to land 20 a day or nite depending on the conditions"
265153,jdmls,2008-11-06 18:22:00,575,"  Rain is starting tomorrow afternoon and sticking around throughout the weekend .... get out and catch'em on the rise !!! I learned a very good lesson on fishing ""the rise"" a few weeks back at Bville .... Timing is everything"
265185,kemper,2008-11-06 20:09:00,2232," Just checked my forecast and its telling me no rain till saturday morning. Weird.  Well if she pours ill be fishin the rise (although I am fresh out of roe, which really sucks) and if not ill be bouncin with worms i guess"
265207,Streamerguy,2008-11-06 21:21:00,121, I was there yesterday afternoon....(left work early)  and all were males too!!  Only problem was I caught 2 of the biggest ugliest Salmon youv'e ever seen and 1 beautiful looking  brown (all on streamers)  Beautiful fish  Streamerguy
265209,johnnyb,2008-11-06 21:29:00,3413,"Okay -- I'm still trying to figure out the rig --- the bottom of the three way swivel, in particular.  You jam surgical tubing onto the swivel, and wedge it there with lead..what dangles down?  A pencil weight?  I suppose how heavy depends on the current...are you picky on the length of the line going to the weight?"
