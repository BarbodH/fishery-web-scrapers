265332,irishfield,2008-11-07 02:01:00,26272,"Got out on Georgian Bay today with GBFisher. Launched in Penetang and made our way out into the sound in the fog. What a beautiful day to be on the water!!! Misty to start out    but nothing compared to the exact same day last year when I had Lew out for 'skis.    We covered a lot of water...fished some wonderful structure... I saw some amazing stuff I'd never seen before, like herring so thick that they fooled the depth finder into think it was a foot deep vs the 80 FOW we were in.  We tried some different baits.. some purchased and some of GB's custom made baits. Came up with nothing but a sunburn!!  Can't beat fishing on November 6th in a T- shirt !!... and a beautiful sun set on the way back in.    Thanks for the company Andy and for doing all the ""work"" in the boat...oh and thanks a bunch for that GBFisher custom poured Perch Bait !!"
265347,tinbanger,2008-11-07 02:25:00,1028,nice day for sure Wayne  somethin tells me we won't be in tshirts for long!  TB
265352,irishfield,2008-11-07 02:32:00,26272,Yah... it's coming Dave... but gonna be later than last year. Water is still 49F in the harbour shallows and 53/54F out in the deeper water.
265357,jwl,2008-11-07 02:52:00,1056,"it sure was a beautful spring day out there today that's for sure, I spent the afternoon on the Niagara"
265358,tinbanger,2008-11-07 02:53:00,1028,warmer in deeper water ? would not have thougt there would be such a difference in temperature .  TB
265377,HTHM,2008-11-07 03:34:00,4082,"It has to do with the mass, a mass of water in depth requires more energy to cool or warm up due to the fact that there is more to apply the change to. If you have a shallow baking dish beside a pot that are both full of water, with the same heat, which will boil or freeze faster? The shallow pan or the deep pot?"
265380,irishfield,2008-11-07 03:43:00,26272,Thanks HTH... I was just gonna tell him to get the hell out there and measure it for himself!!! LOL
265383,tinbanger,2008-11-07 04:02:00,1028,"Plan to wayne next week.  Just surprised of the 5 degree range , thought maybe only a degree or two  TB"
265400,lew,2008-11-07 09:22:00,12767,"As my signature says Wayne, ""you don't need to catch a fish to have a great day of fish'n"", and it sounds like you & Andy did just that. Awesome weather to be on the water, even if the fish aren't co-operating.  Andy's a good dood to fish with and we've shared a boat many times    That was a nasty drive up the 400 last year Wayne as it was the 1st snowfall of the season and too many folks forgot how to drive in the white stuff, but it sure was nice basically having GBay to ourselves"
265402,Terry,2008-11-07 11:12:00,14456,what Andy couldn't find some fish.....say it isn't so..........LOL  oh well still a real nice day to be on the water   are they cutting your hydro on Saturday or are you just out of the area affected......
265405,Whopper,2008-11-07 11:36:00,2174,"Well Wayne you may not have caught any fish but it sure beat what I was doing yesterday, and yes I'm whining  I know there pics in your report but I don't even see red x's  Edit I see the pics now"
265466,bigbuck,2008-11-07 17:33:00,2449,"Lucky Buggers!! I was hoping to get out yesterday but it just did not work out. I hope somebody is out there today since it's probably the last nice day to be out for the rest of the year, from here on in it's gonna be survival suit city."
265491,irishfield,2008-11-07 22:04:00,26272,Getting out today crossed my mind big time bigbuck... but I spent it (and Wednesday) underneath a backhoe instead. Now if I could just get the damn thing to dig a hole... I'd bury it !
265492,camillj,2008-11-07 22:16:00,1988,"Wow .. has it been a year already !!!!!!!!!!!   I am still waiting for my chance to see the new ride Wayne - I presume all the kiddy-barf and cigarette-butts are gone by now from last year's show  BTW I have a three pound - 21"" musky bait - which absolutlry requires a DOUBLE salty to hold her while trolling ... just waiting to be dragged around penetang bay"
265504,misfish,2008-11-07 23:18:00,29133," You see,you got it all wrong. Your supost to be on top of it,driving/controlling it,,,,,,,,,JOE. Man, you can fly a plane,but have no idea how to operate heavy equipment.LOL   Want me to come up and show ya? LOL"
