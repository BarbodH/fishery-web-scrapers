I'm using  a ledgend 151 Angler boat with a 25 merc 4 stroke, MinKota Trolling motor all the usual tackle (Tubes, Jigs, Crankbates)   I startred late in the season and I know the season is nearly over, but I would like to know where in the lake some of you have been having luck at.  Fishing times, Lure colors, weather etc.   Any help would be apreciated.  I thought it may be the time of year but after reading Gerritt's post of fishing with the the extream X team, I am starting to wonder. Thanks again. Brian."
