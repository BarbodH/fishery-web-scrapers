265081,Disspatcher,2008-11-06 12:33:00,73,G'Day All.  Just looking for some recommendations for Ice fishing operators outside of Ontario.  For the last 5 years a group of a dozen guys head North for a weekend of Ice Fishing. Usually end up in an Ice Bungalow in Nippising.  Not a lot of fish ever get caught but good times regardless.  This year a trip to Quebec has been suggested.  Can anyone offer some info on outfitters?  Thanks in advance  Disspatcher.

265099,Seaweed,2008-11-06 13:52:00,135,Many Quebec lakes no longer allow ice fishing... so a start would be to check the regs and narrow down where you can go... then I would suggest using Google.
265157,Disspatcher,2008-11-06 18:41:00,73,"Well, we would like to stay fairly close to the Border if possible. I doubt Bungalows are available so even cottages work fine for us. I actually have searched google quite a bit and its not as easy as you think. Might be easier if I was bilingual.  Any info is appreciated."
265161,Roy,2008-11-06 18:58:00,13728,"I think your best bet will be the Ottawa river. Reasonably close, lots of fish, lots of ice fishing opportunities and you won't need a Quebec fishing permit. That would be my pick...especially if I was bringing 5 or 10 buds who only had Ontario fishing permits."
