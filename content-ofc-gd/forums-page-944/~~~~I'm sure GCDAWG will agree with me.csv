264707,oldphart,2008-11-04 23:28:00,665,"~~~I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in.  I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just cuties.  I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.  I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes, After that you better have a huge schlong.  I've learned that you can keep vomiting, long after you think you're finished.  I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities.  I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first, the passion fades, and there had better be a lot of money to take its place!  I've learned that 99% of the time when something isn't working in your house, one of your kids did it.  I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon, and all the less important ones just never go away."

264726,Roy,2008-11-05 00:36:00,13728," We all know that celebrities are not responsible people so it should read:  I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are politicians. In which case, we don't have to account for our actions."

265011,Greencoachdog,2008-11-06 01:41:00,8163,  There's something fishy about that Ariel girl!
265095,Headhunter,2008-11-06 13:47:00,5703,"I have obviously put way to much thought into this and admittedly, I am beginning to scare myself! Ariel would be an ideal ""partner, she could easily slip over the side of the boat, dive deep into Adolphus Reach and be able to tell me once and for all, what the heck all those huge hooks we mark there in the fall really are!!!! She'd fit in the live well, for sure she would attract the attention of some monster smallies and in general, beat the heck out of an Aquaview! . . . . . . . . . . .uhmm.... how many more days to the Quinte GTG!? . . . . . . . . ....and don't get me started on Belle from Beauty and the Beast!!!! HH"

265214,aplumma,2008-11-06 21:57:00,6896,I have learned that when you fish from a boat you cast as close to the shore as you can and when you fish from shore you cast as far out as you can......   Art
