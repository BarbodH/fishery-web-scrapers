264967,lickmyarmpit,2008-11-05 23:42:00,359,"Was spending some time in florida over the past few weeks.  Got out on a couple charters, The first one is out of ft. lauderdale  Only me and the missus on the boat not a bad day for a few hours fishing all fish were caught in hour and a half.  Some action shots.   For their size those dolphins fight hard even on the ovesized tackle.  Caught a few small tuna and a spanish mackrel as well but heres some photos of the catch.   After that the wife and I went on a cruise in the carribean and got on a reef fishing charter out of st Maarten.  Ihad brought along my 5 piece travel rod equiped with 8 lb. test and figured id give it a whirl.  Fish on right away and off just as quick 8 lb. test 100 ft down on a reef dosn't hold up to well on a medim action rod did get this little jack in on the light setup.   Heres a bucha reef fish shots.................. The wife with an emperor triggerfish  Her again with a strawberry grouper  Me with a mutton snapper  Her with another grouper  And me with this ugly little fella we caught a ton of fish out there these are just a few we had a great time.  As for the best catch of the trip im not sure if it was this huge great white  Or the lovely girl i can now call my wife..... "

You can only top this if you make it custom to travel to a different fishing destination to celebrate each anniversary, now that would be cool. Great post and again congrats to you both.  Is there anyone out there that can PhotoShop a Leafs hat on this guy? Great photos tarnished by a Detroit cap. What a shame."
