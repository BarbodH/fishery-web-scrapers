Picked my buddy up after school and headed to the river to take advantage of the beautiful day.  First fish of the day   My buddy's first ever rainbow!   A couple of the larger ones. A 2lber is a good fish for this stream, a 3lber is a monster.    Dinner.....yum!   All were caught on 1/16 oz jigs, either an olive woolybugger pattern, or pinkworm pattern. No floats....this stream is fast enough, and the eddies small enough, that floats are tough to use."
