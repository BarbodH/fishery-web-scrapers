265774,Beans,2008-11-09 14:49:00,3339,Above the dam at Hastings on the north side of the river about a kilometer west of the stoplights there is a launch that I believe is free...the bass tournament guys use it often and have their weigh-ins close by...  Only 7 days left to fish there...The Kawartha Lakes close November 15th...
