265222,Radnine,2008-11-06 22:20:00,1538,My boat isn't even winterized yet and I am already missing it. Docks are being removed; ramps closed down and bloody river reports (what the hell is a steel head anyway?). I am not sure what I will do with myself this winter. It is not the fishing so much that I will miss (so ice fishing probably wonâ€™t help) it is the whole being in my boat thing. I can't walk by it without stopping to look. I've got it bad. I have already booked three cottages for next summer (this provides temporary relief) and it is still in the driveway! I have committed to myself that I will not go to the boat show in February in case foot-itis takes over and makes me do crazy things. Any suggestions for surviving the next five months would be greatly appreciated. Jim

I changed my engine and lower unit oils... antifreezed the livewells and power wash pump... plugged the inlets and now don't have to worry about anything while that nice fresh oil gets run thru my motor to coat it for winter storage."
