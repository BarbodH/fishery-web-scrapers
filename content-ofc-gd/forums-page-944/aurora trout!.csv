265807,Musky or Specks,2008-11-09 16:34:00,2710,couldnt find a link to my old report on my aurora trip so here it is from another site  http://forums.fishontario.com/thread.jspa?...605?  Im doing the trip again when those area lakes are open. So even though I didnt catch any aurora's . Im still bound and determined that I will.
265310,pike slayer,2008-11-07 01:32:00,1177,"hey guys! ive been doing some reading up on the aurora trout and how rare it is, and that its only in 12 lakes 2 of which are the only known natural lakes for them. i found lists of the names of the lakes but im not sure where they are. does anyone have a map of ontario marking these lakes? i wanna fish for them and catch my one just to say i did it and probably never go for them again leaving them along until they get a decent popualtion(i hope). i wanna plan a trip for next year! let me know! thanks guys!"
265312,chickenhawk,2008-11-07 01:34:00,612,I' m not sure they provide maps showing where to find these fish.....becuz of their rarity....anyways good luck..   Hawk
265315,irishfield,2008-11-07 01:37:00,26272,Was open this year for the first time in ages in Zone 11... Lake just North West of Villiage of Temagami. Accessed by Red Squirrel Rd. Liberty Lake Was only open from Aug1 to Oct 15th. This lake is a sanctuary for the remainder of 2008 and ALL year in 2009. I don't see any other lake listed for fishing in 2009  Same deal in your Zone 10... I see two lakes that were open in 2008 and are closed in 2009
265321,timmeh,2008-11-07 01:44:00,609,Since the lakes with aurora's are often entirely closed for fishing if you really intend on making a trip you're best bet is probably to try to talk to someone from the MNR and ask them about open seasons. They will be able to provide you with the best info.
265325,Nemo,2008-11-07 01:47:00,727,Season Here  http://www.brooktrout.ca/open-lakes-for-aurora-trout.htm
265328,pike slayer,2008-11-07 01:56:00,1177,ya i seen the regulations on it and the picture of the guy with the short shorts gives me the shivers! that short of shorts should be banned and big fines for wearing something like that! as i said its shows the names of the lakes but doesnt show the location! i could look them up in my backroad map book but alot of the time theres 3-4 lakes named the same and it would really suck going to the wrong lake haha!
265337,Nemo,2008-11-07 02:09:00,727,I think the guy in that picture sometimes posts here.......?  try this www.google.ca  BTW your welcome...
265343,highdrifter,2008-11-07 02:15:00,2534," Hey Wayne,  I remember Whirligig and little White Pine having a season, but that was years back..  I've actually milked some of the brood stock at Hill's Lake Fish Culture Station, when I was a wee lad in COOP..  I thought they limed these lakes, bringing the acidity down within acceptable levels to allow the spawn succesfully..  Does this still go on?!  They're such gems..  One day sir.  One fine day...  HD"
265344,irishfield,2008-11-07 02:20:00,26272,"Sorry Pike Slayer... I gave you directions to one lake and it will be open again in 2011.  HD... sounds like the original lakes are totally closed to fishing and probably will remain that way. There is actually a third natural lake and it's Wilderness. All three lakes are up in the park... beside Smoothwater Lake. The ""open"" lakes are all stocked with the 3 year rotation of openings... that they close last minute generally ! lol"
265349,highdrifter,2008-11-07 02:28:00,2534, Thanks bud.  You da mang.
265422,johnnyb,2008-11-07 13:33:00,3413,"That website is pretty cool -- nice post, Nemo!  I guess if the guy in the shorts can catch them, then there's hope for all of us?"
265425,the spirit of fishing,2008-11-07 13:37:00,141,I will be posting a report (hopefully later today) on my Aurora Trout outing from late in Sept. I stayed at Shining Tree Camp inexpensive and great hosts. A few of the lakes that have Auroras are very close to them.
265431,Pondo,2008-11-07 14:12:00,36,nice shorts! 
265433,Beats,2008-11-07 14:17:00,543,Imagine that guy showing up on a construction site like that.  I guess he's got the footwear.  Who wears short shorts?
265436,Governator,2008-11-07 14:36:00,879,"""There is no catch-&-release. If you catch an Aurora Trout, you have to keep it and can not fish the rest of the day for trout. To fish the next day, you must eat the Aurora Trout first as you can only have one (1) trout in your possession.""  lmao..."
265447,Pachone,2008-11-07 15:47:00,276, Saw this and nearly fell out my chair LOL... the whole pose and facial expression... along with the non-existing shorts HAHA
265449,BillM,2008-11-07 15:58:00,17367,Are we sure there is even a pair of shorts on under that t-shirt?   I feel bad for the poor guys twig and berries..  LET THEM BREATH MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
265456,highdrifter,2008-11-07 16:41:00,2534, Doesn't look like he's wearing any...  Maybe the air is nippy?!!  He's not a happy camper though.  Lookit him!!  He's totally ticked off..  Strike a pose baby!!  skimpy..  AHAHAH HD  OMG Thank you.  I didn't notice it the first time.
265458,Moosebunk,2008-11-07 17:16:00,3970,"Probably the last dood to ever really catch a nice aurora.  Anyways, I planned a road trip to finish at Liberty Lake a few years back.  MNR had it open for fishing that year in the regs.  Found the place (pretty easy, huge parking spot that could fit 20 winnebagos), walked down to the lake and a sign on the second last tree said, ""NO FISHING. SEASON CLOSED.  (contact MNR in fine print)  I was beyond pist off.  And you likely will be too if you plan on chasing after other peoples dreams of an aurora fishery ever really being an accountable thing."
265467,Gary2242,2008-11-07 17:34:00,9,"Hi Everybody  I noticed you have been looking at my Aurora Trout page at my Brook Trout site. Even though Aurora Trout have been released in a bunch of the lakes, they did not survive in all of them. For example, Liberty Lake north of Temagami did not take. The released fish did not live. I am slowely getting feedback from MNR officers and local lodges on other lakes.  The very best lake for Aurora Trout is Carol Lake, which is north-west of Sudbury and also where the world record was caught. There are so many bears in that area and they are all starving to death so camping in the area is not a great idea. There is a small trout camp near by called Appolo Lake Lodge - http://www.appelolake.com - Rick, the owner, will take you on day trips to Carol Lake. He has to take you by 4x4 ATV up a small mountain to a lake. You have to canoe across the lake and then portage another 100 yards to get to Carol Lake. This is your very best chance at catching an Aurora Trout. Carol Lake is open August 1st / 2011 so you have time to plan.  Fishing for them - There are no motors allowed on Aurora Trout Lakes. You have to fish out of a canoe. I have written some light-tackle deep-water trout techniques at my Lake Trout site. I use this all summer long in Algonquin Park and catch hundreds of trout so you should consider these techniques if you are going to try and get an Aurora - http://www.laketrout.org/algonquin-trout-fishing-canoe.htm  The guy in the short shorts is actually one of the first people to ever catch an Aurora Trout. That picture is from the early 80's so don't hack on him too much or he will ask me to take his picture down and pictures of Aurora Trout are very very rare.  Thanks Gary"
265469,Pondo,2008-11-07 17:44:00,36,Fair enough but even in the 80's I didn't wear shorts like that.  Nice fish though!
265488,Beats,2008-11-07 21:34:00,543,"I stayed at Appelo Lake Lodge a few years ago with a friend.  We didn't attempt Aurora Trout but knew they were there.  Rick was a good guy.  Definitely 4x4 country.  It's beside Felix, Ontario. Where the men are men... and the women are too!"
265499,camillj,2008-11-07 22:59:00,1988,  Scary ... as it is ... I May ... and I mean just MAY ... have been seen in similar shorts in the late 70's early eighties... but that could just be the scotch talking
265519,BillM,2008-11-08 00:11:00,17367,"All the comments about the pic are in good fun and completely harmless.  Hell, I got a pic similar to that, with socks yanked high, a half top and wrist bands (I kid you not)  "
265686,ketchenany,2008-11-08 23:30:00,3229,"Bill, you better post that picture! We would love to see your Aurora Boriasslis.     :asshat:  It could make you more famous than the Tu Tu guy!"
