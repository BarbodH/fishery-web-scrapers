A group of us have been going on a spring fishing trip to the Shining Tree area for a number of years. Our usual departure time has been the week starting on May 24 weekend. However we had a couple of years where it snowed the first few days we were in camp and as a group we decided to look at a different time to go. After discussing our thoughts with Derek; our host at http://www.duenorth.net/shiningtreecamp/, we chose Sept 20-27 to go fishing. Typically we’re used to catching walleye, pike, bass, splake, specks and lake trout and except for the specks all were co-operative in Sept. as well. One thing that really piqued my interest in a Sept trip was the possibility of someone getting an Aurora Trout. It’s something that’s not an option in May as the season opens in August and closes in October. By Thursday we’d caught numerous fish and I talked the guys into taking a walk into an Aurora lake. We found the lake easily and did try a few casts from shore, no hits but my interest was even higher in trying to catch one of these fish. One of our crew agreed to go with me early Friday morning to give them a solid shot, and armed with oars for the small aluminum off we headed. Our lines hit the water about 8:00. My friend using a small spinner, me a firetiger Little Cleo. I rowed slowely and as quiet as I could be while we trolled our hardware well behind the boat following the shoreline. About 20 minutes after we started I had a hit-FISH ON!!!!! It was a great fight-seemed to last forever as I was afraid my one shot at an Aurora might be lost with a thrown hook or broken line. Thankfully I landed the fish –a nice 19” female. My fishing was done on this lake as the limit is one and there is no catch and release. Until noon I rowed around that small lake trying to get my buddy a fish as well but he never had a hit. Unfortunately I don’t have many pictures from our trip as I forgot my camera-however I did borrow one before going for the Aurora Trout and have a picture of it. I use it as my desktop background and think about that day whenever I see it  "
