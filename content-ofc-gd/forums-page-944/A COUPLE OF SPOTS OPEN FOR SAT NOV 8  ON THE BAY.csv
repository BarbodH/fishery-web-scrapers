264595,fishhunter,2008-11-04 14:27:00,604,I HAVE A COUPLE SPOTS STILL OPEN FOR SAT NOVEMBER 8 FOR WALLEYE   . BOAT LEAVES PICTON HARBOUR AT 6 AND FISH TILL 3- OR 4 . ALL EQUPIMENT SUPPLIED.   PM ME IF YOU WANT MORE INFO. IF ANYONE WANTS THIS ADD OFF JUST SAY SO AND ITS GONE. HAVE MADE THIS OFFER OTHER TIMES  ON HERE THIS FALL. 16 DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE ENJOYED A DAY OF FISHING BECAUSE OF IT. JUST LOOKING TO COVER EXPENSES. SO TO ME NOT SPAM BUT LEAVE IT UP TO YOU GUYS IF YOU WANT IT OFF.
264610,TJQ,2008-11-04 17:05:00,7806,Is this a free trip???   If not this belongs in the classifieds....
264628,fishinggeek,2008-11-04 18:33:00,325,"Doesn't sound free to me, but count me in if it is!"
264642,irishfield,2008-11-04 19:36:00,26272,"I'd say ""sharing expenses"" is no different than any OFC'rs posting in Hook ups and going out.  Lloyd's not charging his Guiding fees when he offers these trips up to fill the blank spots in his schedule.... so that he can keep his skills honed (and get some OFC'rs into fish that they would otherwise never see at the same time!)"
264645,e-z-out,2008-11-04 19:43:00,1052, Well said irishfield  Sorry Lloyd looks like i'll be missing this saturdays fishing once again have a birthday party i have to atend or else the doghouse i go. Why do birthdays always mess up my fishing plans
264647,TJQ,2008-11-04 19:44:00,7806,Not a problemo... I just wasnt sure!
264651,Wendel,2008-11-04 19:55:00,213,"Thanks for clarifying, I don't have a problem with sharing expenses, unless of course that involves buying you a new rod/reel combo before the boat leaves lol"
264657,misfish,2008-11-04 20:16:00,29133,"My bro told me about Lloyed and his days out. Yep,share the fuel costs(OFC,ers) and you get a great day on the water. Rob asked me to join up this weekend,but I still have no venison in the frezzer,so it,s off to the stand this weekend,back with the bow.  Rob give nothing but praise to this guy."
264835,Jet,2008-11-05 15:20:00,364,I'd submit my application if didn't already book a trip to Quinte this Saturday a day before this generous offer. Hopefully there will be a next time.
264850,fisher,2008-11-05 16:16:00,451,I think what Lloyd is doing is great and should be encouraged and praised.  He is giving OFNers (like myself) an opportunity to experience the BOQ (with an experienced guide) for a very reasonable expectation that only his expenses be covered.  Good luck in filling those spots on Saturday...I'll be seeing you on Sunday.  Can't wait.  Fisher
265035,fishhunter,2008-11-06 02:36:00,604,ALL SPOTS FILLED.
265050,nancur373,2008-11-06 03:27:00,1211,"good luck to you guys. Lloyd, fishing better now?"
265052,irishfield,2008-11-06 03:29:00,26272,He's getting lots of fish.... it's just planer boards that he's losing now !
265053,nancur373,2008-11-06 03:30:00,1211,rough waters?
265055,irishfield,2008-11-06 03:33:00,26272,Guess you could say that... lmao !
265227,fishhunter,2008-11-06 22:28:00,604,WAYNE YOUR WAY TO FUNNY. I HAVE MY BOARDS SET UP WITH A 007 DEVICE NOW LOL. NO MORE LOOSING.
265259,irishfield,2008-11-06 23:17:00,26272,"OLFA knife refill blades epoxied to the leading edge of each board???  Is what I was determined to do, a couple years ago, when boxed in my  an  hole in front of us that took his boat out of gear and then turned and cut everyone off."
