264799,danbo,2008-11-05 11:01:00,2646,"Brown Trout on spoons, trolled slow.  http://www.landbigfish.com/images/store/sw...Cleo_colors.gif"
264821,chickenhawk,2008-11-05 13:36:00,612,i was told minnows
264825,Mr Twister,2008-11-05 14:16:00,71,Glow sticks........lol  Realy it can be good action if you are there at the right time (season)!  Good luck!
264839,POLLIWOGG,2008-11-05 15:37:00,835,"Fish em while you can, its in the works to make hydro plants and bridges no go zones due to terrorist activity.  No kidding."
264892,Rich,2008-11-05 19:01:00,3927,"Supposedly in the next couple of years we won't be able to get within 2 miles of Nanticoke outflow.  Should be funny, they'll have to stop every boat exiting Hoover's marina."
264896,misfish,2008-11-05 19:08:00,29133,Smallies to be had on tubes . Whats a brown? LOL Bro was talking about them pushing you out away from the plant already.
264924,Arnaldo de Sousa,2008-11-05 21:24:00,21,"Thanks for the replies, at least I know that I can expect to find Browns, Bass and maybe some whites out there?  I'll probably grab a few dozen minnows on the way up and also troll with some spoons and cranks.  If anyone has more info I'm all ears, or in this case all eyes LOL   Thanks again everyone that replied. . . .I'll post a report tomorrow evening"
264926,misfish,2008-11-05 21:32:00,29133," You dont mean sheephead do you?   Good luck,and watch you dont get sucked in.LOL J/K,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No really,be careful out there."
264930,mbac31,2008-11-05 21:56:00,904,You have a no go zone near the plant allready. Security will escort you out of there. I use to be able to go real colse. I can still get close at times for smallies around the shallow rock breakwall but very rarely. T^here are some nice browns there to be caught with slow trolling. I get some nice Smallies with tubes and dropshots. Some nice Pike there at times as well.
264975,Arnaldo de Sousa,2008-11-06 00:11:00,21," So I can't get close to the outlet there?  Will there be visable signs so I don't get in trouble?  How deep should I be when trolling for the browns?  I don't have any riggers, but hopefully my inline boards will do.  If not I'm sure I can always jig for somem White fish and drop shot for bass.  Thanks for the info, and please give more LOL"
264979,Arnaldo de Sousa,2008-11-06 00:19:00,21, No I don't mean sheephead LOL - white fish!!! and thanks for the luck and I'm always as careful can be when it comes with water.  You can never underestimate the power of water.  Thanks misfish
264992,Kerry,2008-11-06 00:41:00,383,"I'm not sure if this will help as it's been many years since we fished there and usually in March.But if conditions were good enough to get out from Frenchmen's bay(ice free at the mouth) we would launch and drive the 400 or so yards to the closest outflow and anchor just off the edge of the flow.Boat sitting in 35 degree water and we're casting into 70 degree water not 20 ft away.We would drift shiners using from 2 to 4 splitshot depending on the strength of the flow.One thing with browns and using shiners there.DON""T set the hook on the first hit as they are notorious for streaking in and swiping or bumping their prey to stun it and then come right back in and engulf it.It took me a lotta tries before I hooked up with my first.Also 6lb test is pretty much essential and make sure you got more or an extra rod cause you can get spooled by huge carp,maybe a salmon and also some big sheepshead,they all use the outflow to their advantage.The other outflow on the opposite side is good for walleyes but you have to be very careful of prevailing winds and it's been too many years and I'm not sure which ones to be wary of.Anyway good luck in your hunt! BTW back in those days there was a chain barrier and I believe it was posted about 75ft out or so,something like that;back in the early 90's.Likely not allowed to be in that close now since 9 11.

264996,POLLIWOGG,2008-11-06 00:48:00,835,"I got the E-mail here somewhere, some homeland security type thing asking for suggestions on how to secure power plants and bridges . I found the whole thing sort of stupid, you put a big gun on your bridge or power plant and shoot anybody that comes near, or  not, are  the only options."
265004,msp,2008-11-06 01:27:00,1336,"The power plant has all kinds of fish .Pretty much every species that smims in Lake Ontario can be caught at the power plant. Most of the best fishing is in the colder months (Nov.-Dec.Mar.-Apr.)Any time that I have fished there we used Niagara rigs with minnows or plastics.We drive up the east warm water outflow(not too far up),drop the trolling motor down and keep my rig as verticle as possible. Try to match your weight to the speed of the current. Let the current push you out into the lake and use the trolling motor to keep your boat in a good position.Once you get out into deeper water,start your main motor and do it over again.Dont drive up to close to the out flow because security will come and tell you to leave.as far as trolling, anything goes.....Countdown rapalas,deep diving cranks ect. 30-40feet of water."
265009,Arnaldo de Sousa,2008-11-06 01:38:00,21,"thanks again everyone.  I think I'm pretty much set.  Leaving Mississauga around 6am and fish till about 3 or 4pm.  not sure where to grab sme minnows, but i'm pretty well stocked with plastics and lots of spoons and cranks.  Thanks again, and i'll be sure to post a report when we return,"
265034,ehg,2008-11-06 02:33:00,2666,"If you can't find minnows, crankbaits or rattletraps in silver work well. Finding the break from 8 to 15 ft. is a good spot. Just staying in the flow and casting about should produce. Last time i was there the water was real clear so flatline trolling with lots of line out or long casts while drifting would be the best. There is a bridge on the east side which you shouldn't pass or security will appear and yell at you. Watch the winds and waves."
265464,Arnaldo de Sousa,2008-11-07 17:31:00,21,"Well the little outing wasn't bad - water was gin clear and like a glass top table.  Onlly managed to catch a Sheepie, but she was funt o bring in, probably about 7lbs.  Lots of fish holding bottom.  Maybe need the main lake to drop in temp a bit more.   Thanks to all who replied with information."
