The second, smaller, boat could also be at fault, of course, if it was going too fast. As CB says, it sounds unlikely thatb a boat going 17 km/hr could have resulted in 2 deaths."

1050333,DRIFTER_016,2019-09-27 02:47:00,10439,Has anyone actually seen pictures of the accident or know what the boats were that were involved? 17kph can do a heck of a lot of damage if the boats are big enough. The bigger the boat the higher the mass and the bigger the force. Simple physics really.

1050342,lew,2019-09-27 10:41:00,12766,There's truth to what you say as I actually posted here about the guys dying on Stoney Lake and it received very few replies. Guess it just takes a celebrity to be be involved to bring out all the OFC forensic experts.

1050368,DRIFTER_016,2019-09-27 15:53:00,10439,But if that smaller boat is a 36' express it has many tons of inertia @ 17kph. Remember Force=Mass x Acceleration. Newton's second law of physics. A little different if it's an 18 footer.
1050369,SirCranksalot,2019-09-27 16:06:00,3291,"But likewise F=ma for the bigger boat. So, if that 36' boat were to run into a big ocean cruiser, the people on the cruiser would feel very little acceleration----barely even notice. Ya think 1 of us might be called as an expert witness??"

Mr. Greenspan, however, pointed to a copy of the Canada Gazette from April, 2009, which publishes federal government regulations. The document states that higher penalties and potential jail time applies to non-pleasure vessels, while pleasure vessels carry a maximum penalty of $10,000. "

They act like the weather caused the accident. If you are driving a boat fast enough at night that you cant see another boat, you are at fault regardless of if they have lights on or not. Although its not the situation here, I can assure you that there has been countless situations where people have been stranded at night with a bad battery in their boat which hasnt allowed them to turn on their navigation lights. In this case the people that shut their lights off are indeed in the wrong, but so are you for not driving according to conditions."
1050135,gaspumper,2019-09-24 19:36:00,393,Why would he have to give a breathalyzer? His wife was charged for careless operation of a vessel not impaired operation.
