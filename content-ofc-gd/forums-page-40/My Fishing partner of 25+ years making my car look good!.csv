1050387,misfish,2019-09-27 16:55:00,29133,Think thats when I bought mine. Oh stupid and young I was to get rid of it.
1050397,jimmer,2019-09-27 19:01:00,2730,That is one sweet looking ride! Always nice to hear of someone keeping their car from their youth.
1050400,Old Ironmaker,2019-09-27 19:23:00,8243,Wayne is it too late to adopt me? You get down there safely and enjoy yourselves.
1050416,irishfield,2019-09-27 20:36:00,26272," Probably OI, I'm too old to look after children! LOL.. ... I got married in '82 with $13.84 cents in the bank and Leah had a grand.. so I married for money! Only to find out her Mother had froze her bank account! "
1050420,Old Ironmaker,2019-09-27 20:58:00,8243,"I'm potty trained Wayne. They say the 1st time you marry is for sex, the 2nd time for love and the last time for money. I have only married once. The gal I've been with for the last 27 years is too stuck on the love thing, I am too."
1050434,Sinker,2019-09-27 22:33:00,8692,You think that Ford will make it down there? You need a RAM! Congrats to your daughter. Looks great! 
1050436,misfish,2019-09-27 22:36:00,29133,Now that's funny right there. I don't care if your a Ford owner or not. LMAO  High 5 bro
1050437,irishfield,2019-09-27 22:39:00,26272,LOL Shayne... it might need a new engine by the time I get back. Watching oil usage isn't gonna be fun every 200 miles to Bama and back !
1050446,Old Ironmaker,2019-09-28 00:17:00,8243,Ford offers over 950 different versions of the F-150. They might get it right one of these days. I admit Rams are pretty trucks. Personally I don't need a cooler under the rear passenger seat I'd rather have the reliability of a good old Chevy 350 ci.
1050762,David Chong,2019-10-07 19:24:00,836,Beautiful restoration of a Classic!
1050292,irishfield,2019-09-26 21:48:00,26272,Our Gorgeous Daughter making my freshly restored '69 Bee look good ! 
1050293,HTHM,2019-09-26 21:53:00,4082,Wayne..... she's prettier. The car turned out great!
1050294,NAW,2019-09-26 21:56:00,4022,Been following your facebook feed Wayne.   Busy man you have been!!  Great job on... Everything!
1050296,ketchenany,2019-09-26 22:16:00,3229,Congrats on the car and the wedding Wayne. 
1050297,irishfield,2019-09-26 22:18:00,26272,Rehearsal the day before.... I think she's happy !  
1050307,knightfisher,2019-09-27 00:14:00,237,Nice pictures. What's under the hood ?
1050309,irishfield,2019-09-27 00:58:00,26272,I assume you're talking about the car!  The motor it was born with on the assembly line. This has been my car since I was 17 (1979) and my Father's before that! 4.5 years and 3000 hours of work in the restoration. EVERY bolt came out of the car.    
1050310,BillM,2019-09-27 01:00:00,17367,Awesome Wayne!
1050312,Terry,2019-09-27 01:04:00,14456,real nice under the hook and a real pretty bottom too or underneath
1050313,irishfield,2019-09-27 01:08:00,26272,"LOL Terry.. I know you are talking about the car, because you fish out of my camp!!"
1050329,Old Ironmaker,2019-09-27 02:42:00,8243,Does she get the car in the will? Or should I say does the new guy get it too? I'm so happy you can have some happy days in your life Irish. You guys deserve it.
1050331,Moosebunk,2019-09-27 02:44:00,3970,Beauties the both of 'em! Should be proud of the work you put into raising one and restoring the other.
1050335,irishfield,2019-09-27 03:07:00,26272,"From here on out they had better all out live me! Son gets this car and since we've lost a kid I sold Leah's old Vette and we're now down to two classics. I guess the Daughter gets the SuperBird then, if I don't sell it while I'm at Talladega (with it) in 12 days. Test loaded today for position and tie down logistics for the 20 hour haul to Bama next week. "
1050341,Chuck Enwinde,2019-09-27 05:37:00,247,That's incredible Wayne.  The girl in the denim jacket in the first pic looks like she just had her mind blown.
1050343,Whopper,2019-09-27 10:56:00,2174,"Well done Wayne on the car, one thing about you and your projects nothing is never half arse. Congrats to the family on the wedding."
1050345,Cast-Away,2019-09-27 12:06:00,790,"Wow Wayne, you do such quality work! Very Nice restoration Bud ☝️"
1050347,Ralph Field,2019-09-27 12:30:00,1018,Super job on the car and congratulations to your daughter on her wedding !
1050360,irishfield,2019-09-27 13:46:00,26272,That's just the Maid of Honour pulling her hair out !!
1050361,BillM,2019-09-27 14:04:00,17367,Don't you dare sell the 'Bird lol
1050364,Reef Runner,2019-09-27 15:23:00,980,Nice clean restore.  Beauty's all of them. My uncle has a 69 road runner sitting in his garage that was also his first car.  Supposed to be his retirement project and now that he's retired he says he can't find the time the honey-do list gets longer and longer lol.  Great job!
1050373,misfish,2019-09-27 16:17:00,29133,Well you already know how I feel about that car Wayne. Super job bud. I can picture it with Tornado rubber and Cragar chrome.  GRATS TO THE WHOLE FAMILY.
1050376,Terry,2019-09-27 16:20:00,14456,"I’m old, of course I mean the beautiful car"
1050379,misfish,2019-09-27 16:29:00,29133,YUPPPPPPPPPPP
1050380,Terry,2019-09-27 16:33:00,14456,"hey, hey hey,..dont put words in my mouth  lol most of the people i know call me an early riser because i am up between 430 and 6 every morning"
1050385,irishfield,2019-09-27 16:50:00,26272,LOL.. I can do the tires.. when I picked it up from Mom's in '86
