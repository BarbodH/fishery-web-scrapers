That's just looking for it. I learned a long time ago DO NOT look for lost golf balls in, near or some God  awful Jungle type fauna. I happened across a nest of baby Rattle Snakes in a Myrtle Beach sand trap looking for a 50 cent golf ball. Moma was none too happy. My pals didn't think I could still move that fast. Buddy once nearly stepped on a 12 foot Gadder looking for his ball in FLA, never again. I once put one of those little lizards in the glove box in Fla. and asked the same pal to hand me a Kleenex. He screamed like a 12 year old little girl at a Beatle concert."

1050617,Rizzo,2019-10-03 22:46:00,4754,those turtle probably knew what they were doing...looks like they have survived a few winters already
1050637,Reef Runner,2019-10-04 15:46:00,980,"Just this past labour day I was cleaning a few fish on the dock, dipped my hands and knife in the water to get some slime off and up swims a 20 pound snapper right under my hands.  Had to check my appendages after that..."
1050640,Old Ironmaker,2019-10-04 17:01:00,8243,"Tell bro his posture is all wrong.  I would be checking more than my appendages, my Depends perhaps."
1050760,David Chong,2019-10-07 19:20:00,836,Not sure what they were actually doing? Why are they bothering those snapping turtles? Lucky they were able to keep all their digits!
