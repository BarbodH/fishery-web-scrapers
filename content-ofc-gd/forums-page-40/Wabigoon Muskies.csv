There are some really nice pike on the reefs and in the weeds this time of year and the muskies seem to be in 2' to 5' in the weed also.  Here are a couple of musky I got on film a couple days ago.

1049976,leaf4,2019-09-21 16:25:00,2466,Damn that's wicked! Nice catches for sure
1049977,OhioFisherman,2019-09-21 16:26:00,6623,"I always considered a muskie a northern pike on steroids! Nice fish, and better luck landing them than I ever had."

1049998,North Channel Cottages,2019-09-22 01:09:00,18,"That was sweet, thanks for sharing. What is the water temp up there where you found those muskie."
1050003,Old Ironmaker,2019-09-22 04:19:00,8243,Better get a bigger net. Good solo job. While your at it better get a bigger boat.
1050048,Hack_Fisherman,2019-09-23 01:52:00,720,Beautiful catches. Boat is pretty nice too. I’d sure be happy with it
1050066,AKRISONER,2019-09-23 16:27:00,5558,Time to get a musky net lol
1050067,Reef Runner,2019-09-23 16:29:00,980,Great action film.  Thanks as always!
1050262,limeyangler,2019-09-26 13:01:00,5204,"Next year for sure, he is more into bird hunting though.  It is hovering around 60℉.   I WISH!   Got one already but it takes up too much room in the boat, lol. "
1050508,David Chong,2019-09-29 00:08:00,836,Cool!
1050529,dave524,2019-09-29 12:01:00,4508,"Early 80's the ""Goon"" was the go to spot for big muskies in Ontario , if you remember the Molson's Big Fish Contest, a local resident there, "" Craig Dawson "" dominated it for a few years . "
1050566,limeyangler,2019-09-30 11:54:00,5204,"It was a cool experience for sure, i've been trying to replicate it for the last 2 weeks without catching one, but i'm learning all the time and fishing areas i've never fished on Wabigoon, feels like a new lake some days. That's awesome, thanks for the history lesson, will investigate that further."
1050675,Raf,2019-10-05 16:41:00,3495,You are in muskie god country surprised it took this long.  So much water around you with good numbers and size
1050693,limeyangler,2019-10-06 00:34:00,5204,"I’m starting to get into it, I’m kinda just casting for pike or anything, went out today for 6 hours in the pouring rain and got 4 musklettes(small ones... lol) , like you say, it’s nice to be 30 seconds from Wabigoon and 20 minutes to Eagle Lake."
1050715,Sinker,2019-10-06 15:59:00,8692,"Your feeling the addiction. I like it.Man, If I lived where you do, I wouldn't fish for anything else. Well, maybe the odd walleye stop for a meal, but it would be muskies non stop for me. Eagle lake is a bucket list lake!! S."
