1050027,Raycaster,2019-09-22 18:20:00,528,Want to move tranducer on my pontoon as I had it off a bar clamped to back producing a ton of wake and collecting weeds.  i noticed alot of pontoon owners mount the transducer off a back bracket of a toon but Im not that lucky and dont have one. Would a simple adjustable bracket hold with jbweld?  i have included an image and know the angle is wrong etc. But if I cleaned the aluminum and steel clean would jbweld do the job? 
1050029,misfish,2019-09-22 19:03:00,29133,Fabricate a holder. It is not hard to do. I would not trust JB weld for this application..
1050030,Raycaster,2019-09-22 19:11:00,528,I could fabricate a nice holder but securing it to the aluminum is still the problem.
1050031,misfish,2019-09-22 19:24:00,29133,Fabricate one for off the frame of the toon.  That is what I meant. Use the pontoon as a deflector.
1050032,Terry,2019-09-22 19:27:00,14456,on my lund i glued a piece of puck board on the transom and then screwed the 3 transducers onto it  . never had a problem
1050035,aplumma,2019-09-22 21:37:00,6896,First scuff the aluminum for fresh shiny metal with 80 grit as well as the puck board. Wipe both down with alcohol and let dry.  use this https://www.defender.com/product.jsp?id=3726812 or equal. The scuffing is very important to give the bonding agent something to hook to. Duct tape in place with pressure till it dries. Seal edges with silicone caulk and allow to dry. Drill into puckboard and mount transducer. Art

1050039,Terry,2019-09-22 23:01:00,14456,"no problem Polyethylenes can be shaped and formed by standard heat forming techniques. If polyethylene is heated to within 5°C of its melting point, it can be shaped easily and will retain its imposed form on cooling. High density polyethylene for instance should be heated to a range of 130°C — 135°C for forming"
1050041,Canuck,2019-09-22 23:57:00,491,I would recommend a Stern saver.  They sell them at Bass Pro and other places.  I used them to install transducers on my current and last boat to avoid drilling holes.  They work great. http://sternsaver.com/ 
1050043,Terry,2019-09-23 00:07:00,14456,"yeah thats what im talking about, i didnt know they sold it as a kit i wonder what the charge for a 5 buck piece of puck board and some glue"
1050044,OhioFisherman,2019-09-23 00:24:00,6623,"https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/stern-saver-mini-transducer-mounting-system 30 bucks, I would rather pay that than adding a couple of holes?"
1050045,Terry,2019-09-23 01:00:00,14456,well thats US so could be twice that here and what i posted doesnt need holes and is made of the same material so i would save the money and buy lures 
1050060,Sinker,2019-09-23 13:41:00,8692,"Like the others have said, use the  HDPE plastic. I get mine at a plastics shop for next to nothing. He lets me go through his cut offs bin. I use that stuff for all kinds of things.  I glue mine on with 3M 5200 and its never ever budged. I probably couldn't get it off if I tried.  I have a bunch if your ever in the Peterborough area. S."
1050061,porkpie,2019-09-23 13:58:00,2521,I’ve used 3M 5200 and starboard for 15 years now to secure transducers to the stern of the boats I’ve owned.  The original board that I first mounted without screws is still on the boat (a buddy owns it now). That’s the way I’d go!
1050062,CRUD150,2019-09-23 14:01:00,87,"White kitchen cutting boards, sold at Canadian tire. Cut em to size, use 5200 adhesive, they work great."
1050064,wkrp,2019-09-23 15:21:00,656,X2 5200 is great
1050078,Rattletrap2,2019-09-23 19:07:00,1652,"Wayne (Irishfield) would be your best resource for attaching to the pontoon, but I would think a good adhesive (or epoxy) and some decent pop rivets like 3/16"" or bigger would be best. I have never used the 5200 sealant, but it sounds like others have with good success."
1050085,Old Ironmaker,2019-09-23 20:06:00,8243,"This is what we do to mount transducers. Go to the $ store or Canadian Tire and buy one of those white plastic cutting boards. Cut it large enough to mount the trans. bracket to. Using aluminum screws you mount the board to the transom or toon in your case. You can bend the board to the contour of the surface by heating it up and dry fitting it. You get a tube of 3M 5200. It is the best available outside of NASA. Predrill the holes through the white board into the hull. Put blobs of 3M5200 into the drilled holes in the hull, slather 5200 all over the board and drilled holes, mount the white board to the hull. The next day mount the transducer bracket into the white board again using 3M5200. Looking at your bracket you might get a rooster tail with it. The opening between the 2 pieces of horizontal brackets is a space where water can and probably will produce a rooster tail. Filling that gap somehow will stop it. If a rooster tail doesn't get anything or anyone wet it's no big deal. My Humminbird did make a tail that splashed against my kicker and put water into the battery box. Humminbird came out with a small rubber insert available to customers of my specific unit. Supposed to be free but the marina charged 5 bucks, no need to argue over 5 bucks or a buck 30. Sorry Rattletrap, couldn't help myself, all in good fun. When ever using adhesive like PL, 3M 4800 or 5200, silicone caulking etc. do not apply it in a circle always an ""S"" pattern. Air can be trapped in a circle and it won't glue as well. I don't know if it is true or some guys idea of busting balls on the Internet. Sounds logical. I dunno."
1050087,Old Ironmaker,2019-09-23 20:09:00,8243,"Yep, and 3M5200 isn't exactly cheap but it's worth the extra money by far, bar none."
1050093,Hack_Fisherman,2019-09-23 22:39:00,720,The cutting board & 3m 5200 also sounds great but close to $30 bucks too. I think i’ll Opt for this kit
1050094,Old Ironmaker,2019-09-24 00:42:00,8243,"30 bucks is too much? Welcome to the World of Marine products. 30 bucks won't get you a case of beer, or in my case a 1/4 tank of a gas in my 1/2 ton 4X4, maybe. That proverbial case of Beer is what I use as my base comparison for anything I buy. 30 bucks man. Good luck to you Hack."

1050122,aplumma,2019-09-24 18:15:00,6896,Fake news alert. I found wanting a beer all day is not near as much fun as having that beer after work. Art
