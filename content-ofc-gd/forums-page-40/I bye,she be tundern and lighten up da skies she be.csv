A flash from the left that looked like a transformer blew up caught me attention first. Then seconds later,this thunderous boom that could be heard with me windows closed. Da lord must of been eat,n dem beans again. Seconds ladder water fell like I have never seen before,he must of had a full bladder cuz this lasted about 5 minutes. Had to pull on the reins and wooo the ram down and sit on the side of the hwy for a bit. I dont know whum was more shocked,me or da ram.  I peeps over at my two rod buddies and say, what ya tink byes ? No answer, but I knew they would want to carry on. I guess he was finished with his wizz,so off we headed yonder to our destination with only a few light tinkels and a few left over left cheek sqeeker flashes. The sky seemed to be clear to da north,but we could see it was coming after us once again. Get into tossing the baits for about 5 minutes and bye,if he didnt have to go again. Not even my seal skin coat could handle this pour down. I get in the ram and wait it out. Udders are packing up and heading for higher grounds. Ah aint that a shame I say. Got da whole water to me self. SHAME. Oh the evilness in me.LOL The storm passes,but it has done it,s damage. Water has colored up faster then a black coffee that's had 1 cup of cream added to it, so floating was out of the question. Decide to hook up the missmonster. Oh she be the devil disguise.  She looks so beautiful in her fire tiger tighty ,but she knows how to get dem fish to bite. With a swing and landing right in the sweet spot,I call her back. It didn't take her long to have her first victim. This fresh chrome of a lady fell into a trance and latched on. Nothing like the battle of a feisty lady. Up she went,around the sunken log and back around again. She knew she had to make it to safety,so she tried to head back to da bay. I heevhooed her, muttered a few sweet nutt,ns, and got her turned. As she came to the surface,our eyes met, we had a moment.  My good looks she could not resist, and swam to me  to the safety of my landing net. A whisper from the she devil fire tiger,  we tricked another one, didn't we my dear fisherbye.  THE END   "

1050314,dave524,2019-09-27 01:19:00,4508,"The jointed Canadian Wigglers can handle some pretty good trolling speeds, speeds that will flip a flatfish or kwikfish on it's back and ride to the surface."
