1049920,pics,2019-09-19 12:25:00,1268,Guys fishing in Caledonia have been fined for fishing too close to the dam there... not sure if the same thing happens in Dunnville..
1049927,Old Ironmaker,2019-09-19 16:28:00,8243,Dunnville has been known to harbour a criminal element. If the authorities really want to enforce the law they don't have to go far from the dam to nab a few dealers of illicit drugs and stolen property to purchase said illicit drugs.
