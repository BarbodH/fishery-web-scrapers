1050150,Rizzo,2019-09-25 00:19:00,4754,wow that is a big pike!
1050244,cisco,2019-09-26 09:22:00,597,Good lesson there as well. See how the pike sucks in the baitfish? That's how huge fish hit a trolled lure. Guy I knew who had caught 40lb lakers once told me how you don't set the hook until you feel the weight of the fish. This since he said a lure is being sucked back or sideways as much as 2 feet..... 2 FEET as a monster laker flares its gills and sucks it in. Hook isn't in the mouth proper otherwise and is why many fish are lost. Guys name Wess or Les Parks who got some monsters out of Baptiste Lake back in the day.
