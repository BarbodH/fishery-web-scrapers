1050026,tomO,2019-09-22 17:07:00,363,"I was diagnosed with parkinsons in 2013, I'm about maxed out on my meds and the relief time they provideÂ  keeps shorter and shorter. My last visit to the neurologist at the Cleveland clinic they suggested DBS (deep brain stimulation) surgery. I was wondering if anyone here has had this procedure done or know anyone who has. Thx."
