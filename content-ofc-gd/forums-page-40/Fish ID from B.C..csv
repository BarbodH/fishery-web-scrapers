1050365,jimmer,2019-09-27 15:24:00,2730,Someone posted this picture on facebook and I can't figure out what kind of fish the longer ones are.  The others are bass of course.  Anyone have any ideas? 
1050367,Reef Runner,2019-09-27 15:36:00,980,It looks like what they call a pikeminnow.   For us not a minnow or a pike but hey it's BC
1050374,ehg,2019-09-27 16:18:00,2666,maybe iconnu  or alaskan sheefish
1050382,BillM,2019-09-27 16:42:00,17367,"River whitefish or iconnu like ehg mentioned would be my best guess.  Or just giant shiners, lol."
1050383,jimmer,2019-09-27 16:48:00,2730,Looks like the northern pike minnow after I googled it when reef runner mentioned it.
1050428,craigdritchie,2019-09-27 21:52:00,1586,"Reef Runner is correct, the two non-bass are pikeminnows. They're pretty common in parts of the west ...  run 2 to 3 pounds on average, I think the provincial record is over 10 pounds though so they can get big. They occupy the same kinds of places that smallmouth do and seem to like jigs and spinners. Fight okay, no jumps but they're fairly strong, sort of like a small lake trout. Never eaten one but I'm told they're not that good."
1050429,muskybw,2019-09-27 21:56:00,116,would be great musky bait in ST. CLAIR late fall ?
1050431,DRIFTER_016,2019-09-27 22:17:00,10439,"Yup, pikeminnow. I actually had my buddy in BC send me their cousin peamouth for ice fishing bait. He caught them through the ice. I use them for pike fishing as they are very durable unlike ciscoes. I can catch several pike on one before needing to replace it. He sent me a 35# box of them. http://www.pikeminnow.org/how-to/how-to-identify-a-northern-pikeminnow/how-to-tell-a-northern-pikeminnow-from-a-peamouth"
