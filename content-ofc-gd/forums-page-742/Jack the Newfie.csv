421264,John,2010-01-11 21:40:00,2956,"Each Friday night after work, sun, snow or rain, Jack, being a Newfie, would fire up his outdoor grill and cook a moose steak.  All of Jack's neighbors were Catholic. And since it was Lent, they were forbidden from eating meat on Friday. The delicious aroma from the grilled moose steaks was causing such a problem for the Catholic faithful that they finally talked to their priest. The priest came to visit Jack, and suggested that he too become a Catholic.  After several classes and much study, Jack attended Mass, and as the priest sprinkled holy water over him, he said: ""You were born a Protestant and raised a Protestant, but now you are a Catholic.""  Jack's neighbors were greatly relieved, until Friday night arrived, and the wonderful aroma of grilled moose once again filled the neighborhood. The priest was called immediately by the neighbors, and, as he rushed into Jack's yard,clutching a rosary and prepared to scold him, he stopped and watched in amazement.  There stood Jack, clutching a small bottle of holy water which he carefully sprinkled over the grilling meat and chanted:  ""You wuz born a moose, you wuz raised a moose, but now you is a Codfish."""
