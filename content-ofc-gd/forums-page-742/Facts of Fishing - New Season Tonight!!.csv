420729,kickingfrog,2010-01-10 17:21:00,8333,"Like the show Dave. I am not a huge fan of the destination shows, but a few in the mix is fine. Specially 400lb bass.   I could do without the signing though  What was more sore the next day.  Upper back  Lower back  Legs  forearms and hands"
420735,Roy,2010-01-10 17:28:00,13728,"Probably the throat and mouth muscles, Rob. "
420736,kickingfrog,2010-01-10 17:37:00,8333, I'll leave those to you Roy.
420759,jaydub,2010-01-10 18:54:00,145,"I love watching the show as do a few of my kids...it's definitely the only fishing show that keeps the interest of my kids!  I am a big fan of the locally shot shows but this week's 400lb + Groupers show was awesome and as was the Alligator Gars show from last season!  Love the enthusiasm with each strike and fish landed!!  I look forward to seeing the rest of the ""Facts of Fishing"" season 3!  GREAT job Dave!!"
420773,walleyejigger,2010-01-10 19:25:00,876,"just gotta catch one of those fish and my freezer would be set for the year, LOL, wouldnt want to be the one to have to clean it though,the excitement and enthusiasm you have during the shows is awesome, must be exhausting in itself, reminds me of myself when i was a kid, except my dad used to tell me to shut up and sit down ur gonna scare all the fish, now they give kids meds for that sort of behaviour........... so what are you on, haha"
420888,tibbs,2010-01-10 23:43:00,650,"I just watched it on The Score... Fantastic Show Dave! I can't believe how thick the 600 lb line was! It was great seeing you catch that 450lb grouper, even when it wrapped you around all of that structure. If I'm ever in Boca Grand I will definitely go fishing for Goliath Grouper. Congrats on the fish of a lifetime!"
420902,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-01-11 00:17:00,76,"Here I am 'using' my first post here to comment on your show Dave  I snuck out of work too watch it too    ...and in the process got my dad 'hooked'. We were both laughing out loud watching it over a coffee.  I thought it was fantastic Dave, I loved seeing you sunning yourself with that 'big girl' on the beach....that was classic.  I am looking forward to the rest of this season buddy ! If you ever need a partner for a show (since you are often in the neck of my woods) I can adjust my schedule no problem  Good luck from the rippinlipsfishingteam"
420914,vinnimon,2010-01-11 00:45:00,2593,"I kinda in a jiffy here.Me and the girls loved watching dave on wfn.We recently switched from cable to expressview.I specifically told the wife to order wfn and the rest of the kids learning channels.To my dismay on day wfn is cancelled as to why.The better half told me it was a promo and she forgot to tell me.Damn.Guess what I cant watch or comment one the show for the contest.JUST HEAR ABOUT IT.For the shows Ive seen Dave,from the past I lovem.Very refreshing and a little different view on things in my mind.A spirit rekindled in me from red fisher,and when we say izumi drive by our place wayback when and us at the bus stop with our rods in hand 25 yrs ago orso.I guess im stuck watching reruns,thats okay.Cheers to you Dave Mercer."
420994,johnnyb,2010-01-11 03:06:00,3413,"Great to see another season of ""THE SHOW"" underway, and what a way to start it!!! My son and I were blown away by the size of everything involved in Grouper fishing....the hooks, the bait, the 600lb. test line!!!!...and the fish themselves were staggering My favourite line: ""I know big girls and these are BIG GIRLS""  tied with ""I done hooked Shamu!!""  Awesome stuff...thanks for putting a great show together Dave...can't wait to see what else you've got for us"
421077,Chrispy,2010-01-11 15:19:00,168,"As usual you have outdone yourself again Brother.....great show!!  It was incredible to see how close to shore you were fishing for those ""big girls"" and like you, I know about big girls!!!  LMAO!!!  Your editing let the big fish out of the bag a little early though, a picture of you flashed with you swimming with the biggest one you caught about 20 minutes into the show.....I am going down to that way in another month, I just might look up the Captain and take my Dad out, would be a trip of a lifetime!!!  You are always entertaining, educational and great to watch Dave.....Coo Coo Kat Choo Buddy!!!  LOL!!   Chrispy!"
419547,Dave Mercer,2010-01-07 13:30:00,148,Thank you all very much! Your feedback mean a lot to us. However if you liked last nights show wait tell next weeks show you will love it. It's one of the best shows we have ever done in my opinion and it's something you are not used to seeing me do or ever thought I would do lol.  As far as the local vs exotic shows it's always a hard balancing act. For as many people who say they don't like the travel shows we have a ton of people that love them. Also please remember for some of our viewers Fla is a local show. So what we do is about an 80-20 split of local vs exotic and as far as the exotic trips most of them are not super exotic you can drive to most.  Next weeks show is local.  Anyways please keep the feedback coming and thank you all for you support always!  P.S I'm getting a bunch of emails a from people who don't get WFN. Don't worry it will be on The Score this weekend Sat and Sun at 9am and Sun at 130pm. For those of you that don't get WFN or The Score you will be happy to know we are adding more and more stuff to our You Tube channel every day so please subscribe there and you will soon see everything we do.  Dave

419560,I'mHooked,2010-01-07 13:58:00,525,"Ok, I've got a chorus for a new song!!...""Dave and his Big fat salties make the fish'n world go 'round""  There shouldn't be any copyright infringement.   I checked with Freddy already! (although I haven't heard from him yet, I think he'll be ok with it  )"
419562,fisher,2010-01-07 13:59:00,451,"just watched it on the PVR and what a great show.  Next time I am in Florida, I know what I want to do.  Excellent episode."
419564,Fang,2010-01-07 14:05:00,1330,Great twist to show how real men fish saltwater. Anytime you can wrestle to shore a fish of a couple hundred pounds SIGN ME UP!!! Looks like I might be doing a side trip if the family heads to Florida in February. Two things that I liked about the show was  1. (as with some other shows) when a local guide/contact is very well represented. Travelling all that way and trying to figure out who's reliable and knows their stuff when spending a whack of my hard earned money  2. Anyone that noticed the bait on the last big fish? WAS IT A STING RAY? I've caught smaller rays than that fishing at St Petes and Clearwater. How did you hook that up Dave - very carefully??  I just can't imagine sending that down to the bottom . At first I thought it was a big slab of cut bait and then you see it flooping around.
419584,MSBruno,2010-01-07 14:59:00,369,"Just watched the pvr.  It's great to see new shows and no more reruns.  Dave bring such excitement and always enjoyable watching.  I'm not a fan of exotic fish, but I'd watch those goliaths any day.  Looking forward to next year.  Dave, we need a ringtone of your laugh."
419611,Sherriff,2010-01-07 16:23:00,252,"Great show, packed with lots of great info and always fun.  Really enjoyed it.  Thanks Sherriff"
419630,dmacnair,2010-01-07 17:46:00,6,"Dave , congrats on season three. We are hugh fans of your show . Your Captain had great boat control . "" Big Girls "" too funny . Keep up the work  cheers  Julie / Dale"
419633,skeeter,2010-01-07 18:03:00,1907,"ANOTHER GREAT SHOW but i was waiting to see if dave would slip and take a swim with the fish...lol would be funny to hear his last words as he hits the water, if they dont bleep it out..lol"
419637,TJQ,2010-01-07 18:20:00,7806,"That was a great show!!  ""I know big girls"" and ""Dude, I think I hooked into shamu!""  LOL..  how can you not get excited about catching fish like that...  And Capt Dave...  .. there's a man who can handle a boat.  Even if it is front heavy!!!!!  Just so everyone knows Capt Daves website is http://tarponcaptain.com/home.html  He did a few shows for the winter but Daves was the first to air.. so if anyones looking to book: get him soon.  I gotta say thats something I'd love to do.. hey its only a 24 hour drive!!  AND Dave went swimming with his groupies!!"
419660,Dave Mercer,2010-01-07 19:56:00,148,"Hey Gang, Its Capt Ryan Rowan and yes he is awesome not just for Grouper but also Tarpon and Shark and all kinds of stuff that pulls hard lol! Contact him and he will put you on the best fish for the time you will be down there. Just one note that I learned when trying to set up this show is every guide in Fla will tell you they can get you Big Grouper but there really only a few that can all the time. Most of the others can just get you the little ones (100 lbs) lol. That as you saw was not the case with Ryan Rowan if we could get on them in  Huricane Ida what would it be like in good weather? Contact him you will love it http://tarponcaptain.com/home.html  TJ just so you know Ryan Rowan is the Capt,  Mark Davis the guy I talk about off the top of the show is my buddy who hosts Big Water Adventures that hooked me up with Ryan.  Once again thank you all for the great feedback.  Dave"
419698,Skud,2010-01-07 22:27:00,739,I'm just happy that it wasn't just another show about catching Smallmouth.  Cheers

I've seen them before but the show was entertaining and made my 9am wake up fun and exciting! O and I like the newer intro also bud!  ""Nobody knows the trouble I've seen""  Love the singing too  Thanks Dave for being such a great TV show host and making my weekends that much more enjoyable. And Dave, you should ""dress up"" more often my friend. The fish near the end was exciting to see you handle. What trouble you went through getting it out of that cover and docking pillars. If I ever head to Florida I will 100% look into a trip like that!  Thanks Dave for giving us a chance to win some great gear! Mike"
420346,danbouck,2010-01-09 14:54:00,4380,"Just caught the show. I still can't get over the boat control that he had  . I want to book 2 trips with him, 1 to catch those massive Grouper and 1 to learn how to control my boat.  Another great show and I can't wait for next weeks"
420386,canuckjack,2010-01-09 17:04:00,121,"Hey, I've been lurking around here for months now, trying to learn a thing or two.  So first of all thanks to the posters around here.  The show was fantastic, the size of those Groopers kinda blew my mind, and it is fantastic to be out of re-run season.  Maybe I missed it, but you guys were pretty close to the shore, how deep was the water you were in?  Was watching it with the Mrs. and she's seconding all the calls for a ring tone of your laugh Dave"
420456,Dave Mercer,2010-01-09 21:14:00,148,Thanks guys for all the great feedback! It's awesome to hear what you guys like and don't like. Who knew the Big Girls line was going to be such a hit lol! As far as depth we were in about 40 ft. Contest keeps running till Monday so good luck.

420484,backbay,2010-01-09 22:58:00,773,"It was pretty fun show! The 600 pound weed-eater line was and eye-opener, as were the bass on steroids. They were in pretty close to shore! Dave doing his impression of ""From Here to Eternity"" with the fish...... um, never mind. Great start! Can't wait for the rest of the season."

420676,Snowball,2010-01-10 15:01:00,167,"Wow! That was some fishing show. Dave Mercer sure knows how to come up with Season Premier. Who would have thought he would be fishing for Giant Goliath Grouper,in the wind, in rough water, in a forest of old pilings. And pulling them in, one after the other. It certainly looked like a Jurasic Park adventure. That show was a real ice breaker Dave……..can’t wait for the next adventure.  Regards, Snowball"
420690,uglyfish,2010-01-10 15:57:00,981,"im not a big fan of saltwater shows... but, dave ur awesome! some saltwater fishing, like u did today, just looks too fun to pass up. that fish was INSANE! u have a great show, love the enthusiasm u show on every fish u catch, and the information u provide. u make the show fun to watch. my 6 year old thinks ur awesome! his favorite part is the backlash at the opening credits... lol and the following..

419303,HTHM,2010-01-06 22:42:00,4082,I can't get either so I am gonna give my review before anyone else..... Great show with a funny host. Very annoying laugh though...I especially like the part where he hooked that one fish and brought it into the boat with just a flip of his rod. All in all well worth watching.
419307,Dave Mercer,2010-01-06 22:46:00,148,"Thanks everyone I hope you like it we all had a ton of fun making it! Joey since you won't be home by 7 here is our full list of air times WFN Wed 7pm Thursday 3am,11am Sat 530 pm Sun 930am The Score Sat 9am Sun 9am,130pm"

419366,Joey,2010-01-07 00:37:00,9122,"Wow, what a show, ain't nothing better is right!!!  Once again Dave shows he can haul in a monster after fishing Florida for Goliath Grouper.  What monsters.  Using 600 lbs test and a winch, Dave brings in fish after fish.  He then gives them a hug on the beach (the fish are not allowed to leave the waters in that area) then helps them on their way back out to sea.  He definately is the Walrus and his singing, although not quite always in tune, lends a nice comedy to the show that I love.  With braun and comedy, Dave makes for another enjoyable 1/2 hour of TV that can't be missed.  He loves his big girls and so do we.  With salt water in is face (along with a big smile), Dave catches the fish of a lifetime and shares it with us.  Good job Dave, I loved it.  Joey"
419367,BUSTER,2010-01-07 00:37:00,1336,"I'am soo happy to see dave's back for round threee!!!  tonight's show was no let down either, fishing florda's coast for huge fish made 27 casts, 14 fish in 4:47 min best was a 450lbs big girl and dave knows big girls!!!  you'll have to watch it!"

The tuxedo T shirt should make an appearance in every show  2. A complaint, I wish you would show some excitement when you get those big fish on...   Keep up the good work"
419373,skinny,2010-01-07 00:40:00,442,great  show makes me want to go fishing down there for those big girls. i loved the way he would compare that type of fishing with stuff most of us are more comon too

I was hoping for some Ontario fishing but hey it was good. Sorta like flipping docks for largies eh?    This show is the perfect blend of funniness (Thanks Dave) and awesome fishing knowledge. I hope you can keep it going for many years to come Dave!  -Ben"
419392,rob v,2010-01-07 01:16:00,535,"Like a few others have said I'm not a real big fan of the more exotic fishing such as this - but I found this show easy to watch and engaging.  It's not everyday you see 450 pound Grooper being caught.   And while I wouldn't want to see  every fishing show host I watch jump in the water with the fish they catch, I thought that was a nice touch in this case.  Dave does a good job of just being himself on this program without making it look like a staged production. Another thing I enjoy about Dave's program is that there isn't an over-abundance of product pushing - ""just the facts"" if you will - and enough to get the message accross and keep it interesting.   I found this (and most episodes) entertaining, interesting and informative.   A good combination.   Well done.  Hopefully there'll be more episodes ""closer to home"" as the season unfolds.  Rob V"
419431,bucktail,2010-01-07 02:35:00,1857,"The show was great ,watched it with  the kid. It really showed how very important boat control is , wether its presenting your baits  or having to use  the boat itself to move  these monsters out of the cover itself. 600 pound test is crazy and the red mono they were using looked exactly like licorce. Watching it made me sick for  warm weather and made my arm sore!!!"
419447,rocket09,2010-01-07 02:46:00,18,"great show, man was it ever rough near those pilings!!! Who would have thought you would ever need a 150 yammie and 600lb test to move a fish away from structure. I thought my flipping sticks were heavy duty. The best line from Dave ""I know the heavy girls"" That's a classic, again great show, keep them coming."
419458,Minnow,2010-01-07 03:09:00,177,"Hey Dave, Im a big fan and try to catch all your facts of fishing shows. The best part about your show is the excitment that you bring to every episode and I feel that you definately brought the excitment this time! You started off the 3rd season with a BANG, 600 lb test and 450 lb Goliath Grouper, are you kidding me! A couple of critiques are that you went a little light on the line and took too long fighting the little guy next time just power him in! JK. If this episode doesn't get you pumped you gotta check your pulse. One comment I want to make about the fact of fishing the show is that I love the variety of fish and places that you visit and fish, and I think it is a great balance between exotic and local is great (local meaning places us ofners can fish without flying in on a float plane). Congrats on the 3rd season and keep up the great work and can't wait for more episodes!"
419465,GBW,2010-01-07 03:22:00,8460,"ahh, the pvr... even my wife LOL @ ""I know the heavy girls"".  Going to show my kids tomorrow and I know what will be said too when they see it; ""daddy, there's Dave, have you ever caught a fish that big?"" where I'll have to say ""yes....in my dreams"".... Congrats on season 3 Dave!"
