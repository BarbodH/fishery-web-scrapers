421121,The Birdfish,2010-01-11 16:24:00,73,"I have a Jiffy Ice auger 30, 10"".  I was out yesterday at simcoe and it took forever to cut holes, the blades were not catching. Anyone know if the blades can be sharpened and how or if I need to purchase a new set for like $50 bucks???"
421129,Sinker,2010-01-11 16:30:00,8692,"Buy new ones, and make sure the spike on the bottom is sharp too.  S."
421134,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-11 16:36:00,2582,I don't own a power auger so my advice might not apply. However I was out yesterday as well. When it is that cold ice often forms on the bottom/back of the blades...the side closest to the ice. This really effects how the blades will cut. If you had ice build up on your power auger there it might have caused the same problems. I carefully whack it off  with my scoop and then it cuts normally again.
421145,bare foot wader,2010-01-11 16:57:00,1354,"how old are the blades? check for ice buildup as mentioned...otherwise, just buy new blades, solid investment and worth 50 bucks easy in my mind at least"
421166,motion,2010-01-11 17:23:00,403,"Funny thing, I had the same thing happen to me yesterday for the first time. Found that the ice was built up on the bottom preventing the blades from catching. Knocked off the excess ice with a plastic scoop and off I went drilling again. The ice seem to build up quicker when we put the auger on the snow right after we pulled it out of the hole.  Make sure the end of your auger is clear of ice and snow."
421168,spoon,2010-01-11 17:27:00,74,Buy new blades  I did sharpen my old Finbore III blades once and they were never as sharp as brand new....just take care of you're new blades and they should last you few season
421169,mpt,2010-01-11 17:30:00,158,http://www.fish307.com/augerbladeexchange.aspx  Try this co. if you don't mind the exchange. Much more reasonable than new for my blades anyway.
421174,Roy,2010-01-11 19:10:00,13728,"A lot of blades are shimmed, if the blade isn't at the correct angle, even new blades won't dig in."

421181,Woodsman,2010-01-11 19:23:00,1286,After drilling a hole before setting the auger aside drill another hole but not all the way through to the water. This will clean off the ice build up. If the ice is thick enough the auger can be left standing in this hole ready to go when you want it. Or if you clean out the ice chips & fill with lake water it makes a good spot to store your minnows if not to cold out.
421253,The Birdfish,2010-01-11 21:19:00,73,"What do you mean by shimmed, the augers angle/shaft is off???"
421259,Anderson,2010-01-11 21:31:00,32,leaving an auger standing in a hole is not a really good idea during cold weather If there is any water on the ice it could flow into the hole and then freeze due to the upper part of the auger in wind chill Don't ask me how I know but i wasn't leaving my auger all nite
421261,fishnsled,2010-01-11 21:33:00,3520,"If you are going with a new blade make sure you put it on the right way.  I know of a guy who put the blade on backwards and could not figure out why his auger wouldn't cut.   Now having said this,  I'm sure you'll be fine.  I've personally bought another set of blade for my auger as a spare set and never used them.  I've just sharpened the old ones and they seem to cut fine to me.  Same set of blades for about 15 years.  Now, when it comes time to replace them I hope that I remember to put them on the right way."
