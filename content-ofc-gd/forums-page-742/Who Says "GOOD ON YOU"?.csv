420818,bigugli,2010-01-10 21:37:00,6138,"Always thought it was a Pommey phrase. Know a few Brits who say ""good on ya, mate""."
420820,vinnimon,2010-01-10 21:46:00,2593,"Ive heard the scotts in my neck use that term at the pub.And can be taken in different ways.Maybe a failsafe jesture on their part.Ive used it also to mean, good on your part.In a good way."
420827,skeeter,2010-01-10 21:54:00,1907,you've got scotts in your neck? does it hurt?   LOL
420841,Dutchy,2010-01-10 22:13:00,416,"Scottish people sometimes use it, but more likely to say ""good fer you""."
420843,MuskyBill,2010-01-10 22:17:00,311,"I use the phrase often on message boards, but never in person."
420847,Jigs_up,2010-01-10 22:28:00,11,"Good on ya mate. I believe it originated as an Aussie phrase and means ""good job"" . Lately I've heard it used sarcastically when someone does something stupid. (not me of course!) I prefer the original meaning."

420972,Cudz,2010-01-11 02:18:00,2652,Good on ya is very Australian.  Lived there for some time.  Lived in England as well and I would have to say the Aussies use it way more.  Probably originated in Brittain though.
