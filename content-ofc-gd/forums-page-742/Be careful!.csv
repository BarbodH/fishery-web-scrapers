I fished around Lefroy all morning on 7-8 inches of ice and pounded on the perch, got a good meal out of those critters then headed up to Bear Point to check it out.  I was out on 2.5 inches of black ice (4-5 inches of white chunk ice near shore).  I went with a firefighter buddy of mine, we both have ice safety certification and feel comfortable on that ice.  Guys are posting that there is 6-8 inches of ice out there now, and no offense to them, but I have a truly hard time believing that even with these -20 nights, that we have added 4-6 inches in 2 nights, even if there is in some spots, it wont be everywhere.  Don't rely solely on an internet source and be careful out there everyone!!!  Check the ice, wear your float suits and ice picks, I'd hate to see an OFNer become a statistic.  Good luck, and I might as well add the fish porn     "
