He got a small herring in the first 5 minutes and then a laker moved in, and I did my little jiggy move with the line and on she was. About a half hour later same thing and on the ice, another the same size and year class(2006). Headed in about noon and helped my buddy with his portable and got him all set up for next weekend. Looking forward to getting out there again! Ice was about 4"" thick with lots of cracking and one was so loud that it showed up on my fish finder all the way to the bottom. Hope others had luck out there as well today!     Be safe and good luck!  Rob C"
