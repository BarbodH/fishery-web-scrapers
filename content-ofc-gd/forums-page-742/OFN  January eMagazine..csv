ENTER HERE!  Weed-Relating Sunfish on Ice Catching sunfish through the ice is a blast. The corkscrewing battle of big bluegills and pumpkinseeds test the integrity of ultra-light gear and often gets me giggling. Although pint-sized, these fish are worthy adversaries. Fickle sunnies challenge even the most experienced ice anglers. When things get tough, I fish weeds.  The Ice Fishing Touch Without doubt, fishing has traditionally been a sport that depends as much on the sense of touch AS sight.  Dissecting a Hump Out from shore, and hidden from the naked eye, lies a fish-holding factory that is jam-packed with fins and gills from any and all species. Here they bask, undisturbed for the most part, until an intuitive angler finally uncovers them and proceeds to enjoy the fruits of their labour.  World Record Muskie - Nobody believes it. Recently, the World Record Muskie Alliance ( North American group of dedicated muskie anglers formed to end the confusion on legitimacy of record muskies www.worldrecordmuskiealliance.com ) came out with its scientific, peer-reviewed report on the Cal Johnson muskie (currently recognized as the all-tackle record by the IGFA) proving the fish to actually be nearly half the claimed weight of the fish was released.

NEW fishing Cartoon by Phil Harrison and Maureen Shelleau Olive the Lake Fantatsic fishing Vacation Resort in the Martin River - Temagami area! CHECK IT OUT!!  Searching For Early Winter Brook Trout Regarded as one of the most beautiful fish available to an ice angler, the magnificent brook trout is present for any angler in Ontario willing to put in the time and effort.  Gearing up for the ice. For years I lived and breathed everything ice fishing and it truly became a passion of mine. The sound of the hard ice being carved by the auger, the feel of the crisp air entering your lungs and even the sound of your feet crunching the snow as you walk out to your first spot.
