I have driven into the US many times with a vehicle full of people and I think only once have even had show a birth certificate or passport.  I know security is getting tighter but my guess is the driver will be asked a few questions about the trip and everyone will be asked thier citizenship and on your way you will be....but, I guess there is a very slight chance you'll have a problem and even then if your with him and you explain the situation I think you'll be fine."
420697,Dara,2010-01-10 16:07:00,3052,"You have a 50-50 chance. Just remember, if the border guard asks if anybody has ever been arrested you gotta tell the truth. If you lie and he finds out...the whole group gets sent back. And don't even think of bringing any hand guns. Getting busted for that is a weekly occurance at the border here."

I called them yesterday and they express if my son and I don't go they won't either as I'm the one familar with the lake. I doubt they could pull off a shore lunch     i work at a lodge and all of our guests are american. we have had many guests stopped at the border and not allowed into canada because of a DUI. if you dont do the required paperwork you will not be allowed entry into canada. we had 3 guys drive up from texas, 1 had a DUI and was denied at internatinal falls, MN. he had to book a flight all the way back down to texas from minnesota. as far as the passport, you can definitely still get one with a DUI. other countries, like mexico, will allow you into the country with a DUI. hope this helps.

But of all the things that someone could be denied entry into Canada from the states, or vise versa, a drunk driving offense that has been dealt with by the courts, ie not a pending case with possible jail time, for a non driver in a group going on a fishing trip would seam to be not the best use of resources.  However just like around the house, my opinion means squat."

I just talked with my friend who works at the Peace bridge in Fort Erie and he said even if you think you have the proper paperwork there is a chance he might be denied all it takes is a mistake on the form or one piece of missing info and its back you go.

What does this have to do with your son lol.  Well 9 years ago I got a DUI.  Same situation dumb move on my part and I learned a lot form the lesson.  I visited Canada a bunch before moving here but at any time I could have been turned away at the border.  I got lucky in that I came here for work so they didn't ask me many questions and by the time I was visiting for fun I had a bunch of stamps in my passport.  In order for me to stay longer than this latest permit, I have to go through criminal rehab and that's costing me about $3K USD.  Its messy and very time consuming.  I knwo several guys that have been turned away trying to cross into Ontario at least with DUI's from as far back as just under a decade.  I was told that anything over about 7 years is at the discression of the officer. I find it best (If your'e going to try it) to have a driver with a crystal clean record take their automobile and ride as many in one car as possible. Good luck!"

It was stupid, he knows it, no one hurt, he's been paying brutal insurance premiums ever since, life goes on. I see where there's somepaperwork for $240.00 that ""might"" allow him entry for a short stay but Its only been 3 yrs and I think the paperwork requires 5 yrs.

420573,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-10 02:43:00,10439,  Here's info from our Canadian Government that will hopefully help you out.    Overcoming Criminal Inadmissability  FAQ's
420569,irishfield,2010-01-10 02:45:00,26272,"Overcoming Exclusion from Canada. There are several ways individuals can overcome criminal inadmissibility, but the short answer you must give your client is that there is no short and easy way to do it.ยบ These include:  Deemed rehabilitation at a Canadian port of entry; Streamlined rehabilitation at a Canadian port of entry; Approval of rehabilitation through a Canadian Consulate in the United States; and A Temporary Resident Permit through a Canadian Consulate in the United States 1. Deemed Rehabilitation.  Persons are eligible to apply for deemed rehabilitation at a port of entry if the following are true:  There was only one conviction in total; At least ten years have elapsed since all of the sentences for the conviction were completed (payment of all fees, jail time completed, restitution paid, etc); The conviction would not be considered serious criminality in Canada (most felony convictions in the United States are equivalent to serious criminality in Canada); and The conviction did not involve any serious property damage, physical harm to any person, or any type of weapon. top  ยบ U.S. lawyers should note that Canada only recognizes three types of paid representatives named on Canadian immigration forms: immigration consultants who are members in good standing of the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants (CSIC); lawyers who are members in good standing of a Canadian provincial or territorial law society and students-at-law under their supervision; and notaries who are members in good standing of the Chambre des notaires du Quรฉbec and students-at-law under their supervision. Submission of an Immigration form and designation of a U.S. lawyer who is not a member of one of these three groups will result in Canada returning the application. 2. Streamlined Rehabilitation.  Persons are eligible to apply for streamlined rehabilitation at a port of entry if the following are true:  There were two or less convictions in total; At least five years have elapsed since all of the sentences for the conviction(s) were completed (payment of all fees, jail time completed, restitution paid, etc); The convictions would not be considered serious criminality in Canada (most felony convictions in the United States are equivalent to serious criminality in Canada); and The convictions did not involve any serious property damage, physical harm to any person, or any type of weapon. 3. Deemed & Streamlined Rehabilitation Applications.  Deemed rehabilitation and streamlined rehabilitation applications are processed at Canadian ports of entry. Submitting an application for rehabilitation does not guarantee that the request will be approved. Should your client wish to apply for either, the client must bring the following documents to a port of entry during regular business hours (Monday - Friday between 8am and 5pm):  A United States passport or birth certificate (with photo identification); A copy of court documents for each conviction, and proof that all sentences were completed; A recent FBI identification record; Recent police certificates from the state where the conviction(s) occurred, and from any state where a person has lived for six (6) months or longer in the last 10 years; and A fee is involved for the streamlined rehabilitation process, equivalent to $200.00 Canadian. There is no fee for deemed rehabilitation. top  4. Approval of Rehabilitation.  If more than 5 years have elapsed since all sentences related to the conviction(s) were completed, but a person is not eligible for rehabilitation at a port of entry (because of the nature or number of convictions), a person may apply for approval of rehabilitation through a Canadian Consulate in the United States. The same documents required for port of entry rehabilitation identified above are also required for rehabilitation through a Canadian Consulate, plus a completed Application for Criminal Rehabilitation (Citizenship & Immigration Canada Form IMM 1444. Five Canadian Consulates in the U.S. process criminal applications - Buffalo, NW, New York, NY, Detroit, MI, Los Angeles, CA, and Seattle, WA. Again, the decision to approve rehabilitation is discretionary, so there is no certainty in obtaining admission to Canada. In the situation where a person is ineligible for rehabilitation because of the nature or number of convictions, employment of competent Canadian immigration counsel may facilitate approval of the application.  5. Temporary Resident Permit.  If a person is not eligible for deemed, streamlined, or approved rehabilitation, the only option remaining (short of a pardon or executive action) is to apply for a temporary resident permit. This is a process where a person requests special permission to enter or remain in Canada.  A person seeking a temporary resident permit submits the documents required for deemed or streamlined rehabilitation as well as a completed Application for Criminal Rehabilitation, except that the applicant does not check the box in ยง A(1) indicating Application for Approval of Rehabilitation, but instead checks the box in ยง A (2) indicating For Information Only.  As poignantly noted on the Citizenship & Immigration Canada website, the Customs and Immigration officer will review the Application form, look at the nature of the offenses, the number of offenses, when the offences happened, and the applicants current situation, and then the officer will:  At Canadian visa offices outside of Canada:  advise that they do not recommend that you travel to Canada; or, advise that you could apply for special permission (temporary residentโs permit) to enter Canada. At Ports of Entry (airport, marine or land) (Contact your nearest Canadian visa office before traveling into Canada.)  advise that you will not be allowed to enter Canada and ask you to return immediately to your country of departure; take enforcement action (arrest, detention and/or removal); or, advise that you could apply for special permission (temporary residentโs permit) to enter Canada. In Canada  ask that you leave Canada voluntarily; take enforcement action (arrest, detention, and/or removal from Canada); or advise that you could apply for special permission (temporary residentโs permit) to remain in Canada. top  The safest course of conduct is to make application for, and obtain approval of, a Temporary Resident Permit at a Canadian consulate in the U.S. prior to attempting entry to Canada. The website indicates that Approval of Rehabilitation and Temporary Resident Permits take a minimum of six (6) months to process in the Seattle office; a telephone conversation last month indicated the time in Seattle is much closer to one year. Clients seeking quicker decisions should direct their applications to the Canadian Consulates in Detroit and Buffalo.  Failure to timely seek a Temporary Resident Permit can result in disastrous consequences. A client who failed to seek a Temporary Resident Permit was stopped at Customs and Immigrations in Toronto, detained, and returned to Denver the next morning on the next flight home. He was also unable to close a multi-million dollar sale, and lost his job as a vice-president in the cellular phone industry. Another client who failed to seek a Temporary Resident Permit was stopped, questioned, and permitted to enter Canada for business, but was counseled she would not always be so lucky.  Once a Temporary Resident Permit is granted, it must be updated every 6 months to 1 year. It is not permanent. There are significant non-refundable processing fees associated with Temporary Resident Permits, and not surprisingly, higher fees correspond to cases involving more serious criminality.  top  6. Processing Problems.  The most frequent problem is inadequate or incomplete documentation. Although court documents may be difficult to obtain, Canada typically requires them for review. Proof of sentences being completed is critical, which could be anything from a letter received stating that a personโs civil rights have been restored or a letter from a probation officer stating that all sentences were completed successfully, to proof of the final payment of a fine showing a zero balance. If court documents and/or proof of completed sentences have been destroyed by the court, Canada requires a letter from the court which clearly indicates that files are no longer available. Canada also needs to see original FBI certificates and state police certificates issued within the year, and requests all required materials be submitted in one package. While the minimum processing time for these applications is six (6) months, many cases take longer to process."
420575,Greencoachdog,2010-01-10 02:50:00,8163,"To be realistic about this, I've entered Canada without even showing my ID. I just had it ready and in my hand, the border guard saw this and never asked to see it. Just asked the usual questions about firearms, food stuff, where I was going, and had I been to Canada before.  The hardest part of a Canadian trip is getting back into the US, Homeland Security aint playing.. they're stern and strictly business!!!"

I believe my son has and continues to pay for the foolishness of an 18 yr old but I must say it was difficult to help him pick up the pieces. His maturity from 18 to 22 sems like 10 yrs not 4.

420649,Greencoachdog,2010-01-10 13:38:00,8163,"Moparhawk, you should apply for the passport before you say anything. More than likely if the DUI is an issue he'll be denied a passport.  If his passport comes thru I still wouldn't say anything to anyone at the border. Just tell him to play it cool and be very civilized and mild mannered while in the GWN and don't let him drive.  I think the past DUI would only be a problem should he get into trouble while in Canada."
420664,fishing n autograph,2010-01-10 14:13:00,2540," There's no such thing as a felony in Canada.  As serious as impaired driving is on our roads, it is not really considered a serious offence in Canadian courts (at least in the GTA). It's not a violent offence and is not a property or drugs related crime, he ""should"" be fine.  On a related note, in Canada it's called Impaired Driving not DUI"
420665,nofish4me,2010-01-10 14:13:00,404,"One thing I've discovered is, records of offenses after certain amounts of time can disappear, but (there's always a 'But') it must be initiated by the one with the offense. It will never just automattically disappear."
420666,Radnine,2010-01-10 14:20:00,1538,"As much I as I believe that this site is capable of solving almost any problem, are there not professional avenues you should pursue in this regard? When I have questions of these sorts I have found it handy to email my MP or MPP, or the Minister of the Interior, or whomever looks after border type issues. With email communication the answers are usually very quick indeed. I think that they enjoy a good chance to help their constituents rather than people just writing to crab about stuff. Good luck!
