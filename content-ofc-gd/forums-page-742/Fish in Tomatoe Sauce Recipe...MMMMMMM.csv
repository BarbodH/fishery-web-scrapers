Even those who normally don't like fish will think this is delicious! 2 pounds  fish (white) fillets  1 kg 1 egg, beaten with a pinch of salt flour, mixed with breadcumbs (for coating) 2  onions, sliced 19 ounce can  tomato juice  560 ml 2  bay leaves 1 cup  tomato ketcup  250 ml 4  cloves 6  peppercorns oil for frying   Prepare fish by cutting into 3 inch  long pieces. Dip into egg, coat with flour and breadcrumbs (I use Cronzy's batter). Fry in oil until golden brown, then allow to cool.  Pour tomato juice and ketchup into saucepan. Add onion and all spices; simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Arrange fish in square bowl or serving dish. Pour sauce over, cover, and refrigerate overnight. Serve cold."
