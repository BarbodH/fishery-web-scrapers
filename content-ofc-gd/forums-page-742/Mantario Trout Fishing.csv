Regardless of which type of weather the trout wanted to feed in, we had it this weekend.  After work we filled up some trucks and made tracks to a cabin, the -25C temps weren't overly inviting, so with the fire roaring, we retreated to a local hotel to watch some hockey and let the cabin warm up.  A period later things were on the right side of 0C it was time to serve dinner and drink.  Planning and strategizing proved difficult and required the 7 of us to stay up into the early morning hours, to ensure a proper organization.   Day 1 was a trip into a nearby lake with stocked rainbow and splake  Some folks chose to drive to the access point, it was a pleasant morning so I opted to drive my sled with a 'boggan in tow.    Following wolf tracks to our spot we drop lines to fast action, small splake and perch were present in droves and hungry, their numbers and diminutive size were not picture worthy.  A few better rainbow were caught throughout the day, I managed one around 3lbs.  One gent hooked into something substantially larger, after a tough battle on light tackle, up came a 27"" splake, a beauty!    After tapered off, though more of all species were caught until dark.  Dinner and drinks followed...details are not particulary clear regarding events or conservation, however it seems those who didn't catch any fish took it the worst.  Day 2...time for lakers!  With cloud cover and snow flurries I was certain today was going to be good.  We set up near a saddle, covering 2 islands, a point and a mid depth flat, many holes were sunk for those eager to move and shacks set up to provide warming stations.  The first 5 mins saw a nice jumbo laker come up to the hole on a jigging rap, a staunch conservationalist, the gentleman unhooked the laker before his head came up the hole.  The bite slowed....dead minnows on a hook (with no weight) were all the whitefish and lakers would take, a light touch was required to get them to commit, akin to Lindy rigging on ice, we took to finesse tactics...and it paid off.  Craig Stapon, celebrating a US victory at the Juniors and enjoying catching lake trout    I hit a beauty, that fought like a tank, I thought it was going to spool me.    Outside view    The weekend was awesome, great company and pretty good fishing."
421103,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-11 16:06:00,0,nice laker bud.  yours has most peculiar markings eh?  it looks like it has vermiculations all the way up at it's gills....
421108,solopaddler,2010-01-11 16:11:00,8605,"Great stuff Jay! Interesting though...just a hook, dead minnow and no weight of any kind? How deep was the water you were fishing?"
421111,troutologist,2010-01-11 16:13:00,951,Yup no weight at all...fished from 20 to 80 feet...best luck was 45-50fow....long time going to the bottom but worth it.
421116,anders,2010-01-11 16:17:00,1168,solid fish...  that splake must have been something else....hell even those lakers.....love them...gonna try for some bigguns this weekend.
421124,solopaddler,2010-01-11 16:29:00,8605," That's remarkable, just when you think you've heard everything! I wonder if maybe some thin pencil lead shoved down the minnows throat would hinder the action? You've got me thinking now bud!"
421127,johnnyb,2010-01-11 16:30:00,3413,Awesome report...and those pants!  Definitely don't want a roundhouse kick from someone wearin' those bad boys  Very envious of the spots you get to hit up there Jay...keep the great pics and stories coming
421349,Sinker,2010-01-12 00:00:00,8692," I've caught a lot of lakers the same way. After watching them eat up my chum, and not touch my jig, I put a salty on a bare hook, and let it go down with the chum. I had a fish on in minutes...........it works like a charm!!  Its amazing how they will suck back a hand full of salties, but not touch one on a lure, or a live minnow.  S."
