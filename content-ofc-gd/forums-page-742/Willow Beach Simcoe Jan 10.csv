Told it was open water a week ago. Ice surface very rough especially closer to shore, looks like it broke up and refroze.  Challenging for walking and pulling sled as the sled hung up on the ice sticking up.  Lots of slush under the ice also challenging.  Light bite for the most part and slush was tough, caught 10 all 9-12 inch keepers and lost 2 nice ones at the hole in the slush.  Fairly slow but lots of sun and nice to be on Simcoe again."
