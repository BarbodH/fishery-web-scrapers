420921,douG,2010-01-11 01:06:00,2693,"Ok, I just love to make bread.  I like the handling of the dough, mixing, the smell of the yeast, and the gorgeous crispy crackly loaves that come out of the oven.  I am trying to make the best rustic loaves I've ever tasted, and I think I am making some good progress.  Here are some photos.                I yesterday baked my best loaves shown in the last two pictures using a clay baking stone and 4 water to 5 flour by weight.  This is a very sticky dough at 80 % hydration, and I also made a poolish, a wet starter that is shlopped into the fridge the day before, and added that to the wet bread dough.  No knead, but stretch and fold instead.  We like the loaves.  Hope you like the pictures.  Let me know if you have some info to improve this bread for me, or vice versa."

420938,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-11 01:29:00,2582,"douG  I have also been making the no knead bread in the cast iron pot. Probably the same thing you are doing. Nothing could be simpler that's for sure.  The crust is perfect every time. But the bread is very dense. We really enjoy it and I pretty much make it every time we have pasta, but I also wish I knew how to tweak the recipe to make the bread a little lighter.  If I have a breakthrough I will be sure to pass any info on to you."

420973,aniceguy,2010-01-11 02:18:00,1094,"my wife and I were actually talking about this today, not your post but the making of home made breads...care to share a recipie or 2 they look fantastic"
420983,douG,2010-01-11 02:32:00,2693,"I'm learning that the secret to a very open crumb is lots of water in the dough, and bake it in hot oven with lots of steam, on an oven stone, if you can.  Beyond that, it's a dozen or fifty batches, learning to handle the wet dough, and knowing when to scrape the mess into the oven to bake.  JohnF, be very sure that this is a crackly crust with a huge, moist crumb, my best yet.  A coupla more,....      "
420991,Daplumma,2010-01-11 02:49:00,1961,Good stuuf for sure Doogles.I am taking a few cooking courses this winter but have avoided baking on purpose.Its a journey to the soul of the cook and I want to make it by myself.That and I know my ass will expand exponitionaly.Looks sweet bud Joe
420992,ChrisK,2010-01-11 02:55:00,2772,"Doug, I got to learn how to do that.....Ive made just about everything else but home made bread...This may have just givin me the inspiration I needed...."
420996,Canuck2fan,2010-01-11 03:07:00,1444,"If you want the bread to be lighter and you don't want to mess with the recipe except for adding just a bit more yeast. You can usually accomplish this by mixing the dough letting it double in an oiled bowl and then knock it down TWICE instead of just once and then shape it and let it raise then into the hot oven with lots of steam.  If you want to play with the recipe what you can try is blending flours. Start with 95% strong baker's flour, cut with 5% all purpose. Also try using a wild yeast brand instead of a cultured commercial brand."
420998,douG,2010-01-11 03:10:00,2693,"I got started with Peter Reinhart's Bread Baker's Apprentice.  Just google reinhart ciabatta and you are  well set forward on my journey.  If your crumb is too tight, let it rest (leave it the heck alone in a warm 22-23C place) and rise some more.  Then shape it for the oven, and wait some more.  Loaves are ready to be baked when you poke em, and the dough springs back a little, but not all the way.  As I said, I love bread and am getting good at it, I think, so just make a mess, fill yer boots, and figger it out.  Sent me a note if I can help."
