420832,Jigs_up,2010-01-10 22:02:00,11,targeting walleye and perch I was wondering how people rig their live bait. i've been using the buckshot tipped with a whole minnow hooked through the lips. I get the fish coming in to look but no strikes. ( taps but no bites). I am varying up my presentation between short  gentle jigs to long  lifts to really ripping it up and letting it settle but nothing seems to get them interested. Tried the same thing with rapala jigging minnows and swedish pimples and it's all the same result. Anyone willing to offer their input?

420917,Jigs_up,2010-01-11 00:57:00,11,Thanks Terry. I've been trying that. Guess I just have to add a little more patience. When I see something coming to my bait on the flasher I just assume it's going to be something I can catch. Reality tells me it's fishing... not catching!  Cheers

Somedays it is deadly, some days your jigging rod will clean house instead..... Give it a shot  TDunn"
