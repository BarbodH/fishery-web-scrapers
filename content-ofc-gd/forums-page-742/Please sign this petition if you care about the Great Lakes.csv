419407,Vanselena,2010-01-07 01:52:00,269,"  I strongly disagree with your comments especially since you are the site owner. They are too laid back, we need strong action now or say goodbye to the sport of fishing in hundreds if not thousands of lakes, in fact say goodbye to boating in these lake all together.  If this fish gets into the great lakes then all lakes connected including the entire trent severn waterway, Saint Lawrence River and other waterways connected will be full of these Asian Carp and little else. I highly doubt the individual solution of "" Write your elected officials, knock on their door, telephone them...ask them where they stand and what they plan on doing about it. Tell them that you want and are waiting for their answer. "" will be of any help on its own as individual efforts. We will need petitions, demonstrations general public outrage and State Governments willing to take a legal stand to get this done. Every individual course of action will make little difference on their own but the masses of courses of action from different angles will.  It's time to fight for our fishery because our childrens fishing future rests in the outcome of the action we take.  Any action against this threat is a positive thing and every action will build on other actions, whether it be internet petitions, individual government letters, demonstrations or state legal proceedings etc.. We need to stand together and conquer this threat. We need to do everything we can to make the Powers that be understand that this threat needs to be acted upon now.  I like the way this poster said it.  ""The purpose of the e-petition is to get the word out, collect signatures & comments. If you read the directions for getting the most out of the effort, you'll find it is highly recomended for the author to print it off, edit out the Bull comments then mail it to whomever your trying to pursuade. All of the petition signatures can readily be copied into excel by the author.  As for communicating it, if addressed to the DEC, for example, you shouldn't just send it to the commissioner. Rather, mail a copy to him, another to his assistant comissioner, individual copies to his staff, copies to the various regions affected and to sportsmen orgs, etc. This does get replies & if you want, and you should, you can follow it up with phone calls.  You don't have to be the author to print off the petition. (only to edit it)"""

418885,Roy,2010-01-05 18:47:00,13728,"The problem with these online petitions is that once someone has signed one, they think they've done their part and that's ridiculous. I notice that the spaces for physical street address and telephone number are optional. How many folks do you think will give all of their personal information to a company who earns their living gathering valid email addresses? Remember, an online signature on a petition is useless and not even counted if there is no street address and telephone number given. You want to do something about a situation that threatens your and your childrens' well being? Write your elected officials, knock on their door, telephone them...ask them where they stand and what they plan on doing about it. Tell them that you want and are waiting for their answer. Then and only then will you have at least started to do something.  End of rant."

We cannot vote in the US so we have no voice. However we do have treaties with the US and we can prssure our government to help the US. Whatever we give them will pale in comparison to the damage caused if we do nothing. Even if we offer to split the annual costs with Michigan..it is money well spent. Remember it is OUR lax laws that let the gobies, zebra mussles, et al into the lakes via the Welland Canal..a little atonement time for us."
418911,muddler,2010-01-05 20:16:00,623,Done.  Thanks for the link .... muddler
418913,Toronto_Angler,2010-01-05 20:22:00,698,Second Roy's and Ricks Sentiments. These online petitions never do anything as they are so open to irregularities. Call or email your member of parliament to support this initiative.
418915,torco,2010-01-05 20:36:00,656,Petition signed...Although I'm kind of annoyed as this was predicted to happen long ago without intervention. Not too be to negative but with all of our errors over the last number of decades will this be the one to finally kill the fishery and alter the great lakes the most profoundly?
