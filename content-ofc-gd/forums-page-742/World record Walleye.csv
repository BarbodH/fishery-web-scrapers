421279,Anderson,2010-01-11 22:05:00,32,"Was doing a search on google and came across thisI don""t know alot about photoshop but presumably it weighs 23 lbs and was caught in mar /08 in Lk Helen/Steamboat Bay 10 min from my houseWalleys are closed all year in the lower Nipigon River system below Alexander Dam including Lk Helen so my question is if you did catch one that was bigger than the ice fishing record of 18.3 lbs even if you were pike or perch fishing could you enter it  Hmmmm"
421281,TJQ,2010-01-11 22:08:00,7806,LOL  thats gotta be photoshopped... and its not even wearing a tutu...
421283,irishfield,2010-01-11 22:10:00,26272,Terry's been at it again....
421285,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-11 22:13:00,0,look at the fingers down near the tail! horrible chop job!  lol!
421287,Kinger,2010-01-11 22:18:00,351,Thats just laughable.  I could do  a better photochop in 10 minutes!!! Imagine you saw a walleye liek that though? I think I'de have to sit down or have a drink or something.

421301,walleyejigger,2010-01-11 22:37:00,876,"didnt know they got cellulite on their bellies when they got that big, lol, very bad chop job"
421303,Michael_Brown,2010-01-11 22:39:00,411,"This photo has been kicking around the internet for years. Supposedly caught just about everywhere. The next one you might see is the new canadian record pike or possibly the ontario couger confirmation photo. Internet bigfoot.  I have one of the pike photos, actually a pike from europe. Nice fish but not local. "
421365,steve-13,2010-01-12 00:27:00,9,lol i have seen the pike one on the internet quite a few times myself a teacher at my school also included in one of his lessons in our environmnt and resource management class. i also saw it in the summer of 08 at a tackle shop in hearst ontario and the guy there said the smaller pike is around 30 inches and that the pic was taken in the area... dont think so it could have come from anywhere
421392,kickingfrog,2010-01-12 00:57:00,8333,"  Lots of lies on the net, but the photo you have of a somewhat big pike with a small pike in its mouth is legit."

421398,Stoty,2010-01-12 01:15:00,2910,"HAHA, wow, BRUTAL photoshop job on that fish!  If that Pike picture is real...DAMN that's a massive Pike!"
421411,Newfieman,2010-01-12 01:37:00,19,"hey buddy,"
421413,Terry,2010-01-12 01:44:00,14456,well that's just wrong everyone knows this is the new record      
421417,Greencoachdog,2010-01-12 01:49:00,8163,"  The IGFA world record Walleye is 25 lbs. from Old Hickory lake in Tennessee, however... there seems to be a bit of controversy surrounding it...  ... the story:  http://arkansasroadstories.com/nature/walleye.html"
421421,fishnsled,2010-01-12 01:55:00,3520, How did it taste??
421424,Greencoachdog,2010-01-12 01:57:00,8163,  Have you noticed his avatar lately?
421428,Terry,2010-01-12 01:59:00,14456,taste bad  it wa wa was from lake ontario but now I glow in the dark and howl at the moon
421429,BillM,2010-01-12 02:00:00,17367,"That pike pic is totally believable..  I snapped a few similar pics when a 3lb walleye I brought up had a brute of a pike attached to it, lol"
421431,fishnsled,2010-01-12 02:02:00,3520, 
421447,Michael_Brown,2010-01-12 02:50:00,411,The pike picture is real. It is a monster fish with a smaller pike in it's mouth but it was a fish from europe and was run around the internet as being the new canadian record. I have had a large pike swipe at a smaller hooked pike before but it is a neat photo. Sometimes a good photo angle can make fish look much bigger also. The only true test is a certified scale.  No touch up to this Simcoe perch photo just a good angle with some giant perch. 
421456,Greencoachdog,2010-01-12 03:03:00,8163,"  Yeah, if you leaned forward another inch.. you'd fall flat on your face!!!"
