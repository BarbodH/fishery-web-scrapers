421446,spoonman,2010-01-12 02:47:00,103,"The Spring Fishing Show is my Favorite for the fact is 100% dedicated to fishing and the Sportmens Show is camping, Kayaking, hunting, fishing,.... everything.  I will most likely be working at both shows.  Cheers AL"
420746,rob v,2010-01-10 18:14:00,535,"I'm about a two hour and change drive from TO and to make the trip twice is a bit of a stretch.   Last spring my wife and I went to the fishing show and enjoyed it - but she's not quite so pationate about fishing and it didn't take her long to get bored.  This year I was thinking we might go to the the sportsman show instead - thinking it might offer a broader range of entertainment to keep her interested, while at the same time giving me a bit of fishing/boating candy to keep me entertained.  I haven't been to the sportsmans show in a long time - so I was looking for some input from some of the members who have been to both lately.   If you were primarily interested in fishing - but also enjoy other outdoor activites - camping, hunting, cottaging etc - which would you prefer if you could only choose one ?  Thanks. - Rob v"
420748,Roy,2010-01-10 18:20:00,13728,"I have only chosen one...I'll be at the Spring Fishing Show. I cannot do both and the SFS is the best for me. Big mall at BPS, drop your wife off there with a list of things you NEED at Bass Pro and she'll have the rest of the day to shop in the rest of the mall. Does that sound good?"
420756,rob v,2010-01-10 18:46:00,535,"Hey,  that does sound like a good idea.   spring fishing show and BPS !"
420779,Radnine,2010-01-10 19:37:00,1538," I think that your logic is pretty sound here. I went to both last year and I think the sportsman show definitely has more to offer. Not only for your wife, but for you. I like Exhibition place better than the ""warehouse by the airport"" as well (yes it cost more to park, but I think it's worth it). The sportsman show has guns, cottages, sham wows! You can't go wrong. Jim"
420792,jjcanoe,2010-01-10 20:18:00,744,Sportsmans show is no longer at the EX (david miller saw to that)  It will now be held at the Metro Toronto Convention Center right downtown.....not too far from the Eatons Center!  jjcanoe

420804,JohnF,2010-01-10 20:56:00,3494, $4 per half hour max $17 up to 7PM  I've been to a few functions there. It's not too bad to get into (by Big Smoke standards).  JF
420806,adempsey,2010-01-10 21:02:00,1498,"Park at Yorkdale Mall and take the TTC down to the convention center.  Especially if you want to drop your wife off for the day to shop.   Although, parking there is hell."
420836,TJQ,2010-01-10 22:11:00,7806,"Ill be at the Spring Fishing and Boat show this year, and by the way, a whackload of FREE tickets are on the way!!"
420846,JohnF,2010-01-10 22:23:00,3494, Is that a compact whack or a full size?  JF
420854,Syn,2010-01-10 22:36:00,519,"Links to both:  http://www.fishandboatshow.com/ Feb 12-15, 2010 International Centre.  http://www.torontosportshow.ca/  Mar 17-21, 2010 Metro Toronto Convention Centre.    The floor plans are not quite filled in yet. Curious to know how much vendor overlap there is  for both shows.   Any one from last years Fish and Boat show remember if vendors sold lure parts (0.062 wire, big Colorado blades, 4/0 trebles, powercoat paints, etc)?   edit: thanks bigugli."
420855,lew,2010-01-10 22:38:00,12766, You having a booth this year TJ or just doin the tourist thingy ??
420864,danbouck,2010-01-10 22:50:00,4380,I'll be at both but enjoy the fishing show more.
420867,bigugli,2010-01-10 22:52:00,6138,Luremaking.com used to be there but not last year. There were no parts vendors at the fishing show.
420971,kickingfrog,2010-01-11 02:17:00,8333,"  I think the Sportsman show would serve you and your wife better. Just like you stated ""broader range of entertainment""."
420980,rob v,2010-01-11 02:28:00,535,"I may have to review my budget - sounds like either option might get expensive.... go to the boat show - drop the wife at Vaughn Mall $$$$,..... go tto the sportsman show and let the parking meter soak me !   Oh well...guess that's the price you pay !"
420982,kickingfrog,2010-01-11 02:32:00,8333,"The TTC is an easy option.  Personally, I usually spend more when my wife is not around, and she spends a lot whether I with her or not."
421044,jjcanoe,2010-01-11 05:19:00,744, Exactly what I plan on doing.  That way I'm a short drive from BPS to spend my xmas gift cards!  The best sale of the year is at the same time as the TSS  jjcanoe
421049,Stern Rules,2010-01-11 07:07:00,342,"I always go to both. If I were to pick only one, I'd pick the Sportsmen's Show. It'll be interesting to see what it's like at the new venue."
421069,corvette1,2010-01-11 14:09:00,1765,fishing show
421088,Raf,2010-01-11 15:39:00,3495,"the yorkdale -> ttc route is a good idea, save you in parking fee$ and the stress of driving downtown.  one subway takes you right to the convention center."
421089,rock34,2010-01-11 15:39:00,215,The Sportsman show is far superior to the fishing show.  The Fishing show always seems to dissapoint in my opinion.
421397,moemoe,2010-01-12 01:12:00,352,"I love the spring fishing show, I take my boat out in the beginning of april, so february is a good half way point to dream about the spring, plus I always enjoy the Scotty Salmon Seminar, but I don't know if that is on the agenda for this year"
421401,steve barrett,2010-01-12 01:19:00,142,
421403,Bernie,2010-01-12 01:27:00,3190,The spring fishing show several years back was definitely superior. It was more oriented towards fishing and everything I wanted and more was there to see. The last one I attended was...well.....it sucked big time. The sportsman show has all aspects of outdoor fun and would likely appeal to most enthusiasts attending.
