419497,charlied,2010-01-07 04:18:00,584,"I will be in the whitby and oshawa area next weekend, was just wondering if there is any decent fishing or ice fishing along the lake.  Like maybe a marina that people ice fish.  I didn't wanna have to travel up to Scugog to ice fish, and thought there might be somewhere closer.  Even some trib fishing if they are not frozen over might be in the cards. Any help would be great, maybe even meet up with someone possibly."
419502,Sinker,2010-01-07 04:27:00,8692,scugog is only 30 mins from the shwa.......that's where I'd go!  S.
419504,charlied,2010-01-07 04:30:00,584,"Ya scugog was an option...except for the fact I have been there like 8 times before and have never caught a fish ever there.  So I tend to not wanna go to a place I never catch fish at, LOL."
419509,GBW,2010-01-07 04:54:00,8460,well what do you want to fish for then?
419512,charlied,2010-01-07 05:07:00,584,most likely perch or rainbows thru the ice if there is somewhere in a harbour on the lake or a trib.
419554,GBW,2010-01-07 13:44:00,8460,you should PM CANADIAN_COPPER then.
419567,Garnet,2010-01-07 14:11:00,2056,Guess that's the difference if I got skunk on Scugog 8 times I would be mad and more determined than ever.
419597,fishermccann,2010-01-07 15:37:00,655,"Frenchmans Bay , in Pickering, it has pike and perch."
419672,justin s,2010-01-07 21:01:00,16,Rivers are locked up!!!!!!!
419682,charlied,2010-01-07 21:53:00,584,"I figured the rivers and creeks were locked up, but thought there might be somewhere at the mouths that you can ice fish at.  I don't have alot of time on saturday, so I am not able to explore the area."
420083,fishermccann,2010-01-08 19:03:00,655,"Was out on FrenchmansBay yesterday afternoon lots of pike iced, 2-4 lbs. Minnows in 10 ft. About 2 ft. off bottom . only 3 others out there."
420106,charlied,2010-01-08 19:50:00,584,Is there a place close to get minnows?  Can you PM me directions to frenchmans bay please.  Thanks
420142,GBW,2010-01-08 20:58:00,8460,"for minnows you can try ""frenchman's bay marina"" but I'm not sure and if you google Livepool Rd in Pickering you should find it..."
420308,Sinker,2010-01-09 05:06:00,8692,"Tightlines will have bait. They're on Brock St., just south of the 401, on the west side. Frenchmans bay is west of Brock St, south of Bayly, between liverpool and whites rd. You probably want the whites rd access,to the boat launch, but I would have to look up street names, and I just don't feel like doing that right now. Head south on whites, and find the lake.......     S."
420348,Photoz,2010-01-09 15:03:00,792,"Has anyone here ever fished McLaughlin Bay down behind the G M office building at the east tip of Oshawa. Loaded with carp in the summer (they jump & splash everywhere but won't bite) . .   .    shallow & weedy SHOULD hold pike & perch through the ice? I believe that little bay was considered as part of the Kawarthas, and until this year, was closed to ice fishing. As soon as I can get around well enough, I know I'ma gonna give 'er a shot?"
420594,DonF,2010-01-10 03:35:00,11, Note - that is Brock Rd. not Brock St. Brock St is in Whitby. Causes lot's of confusion for visitors.
420619,Sinker,2010-01-10 05:00:00,8692,"  Yep, thanks for clearing that up, your 100% correct!!  S."
420782,charlied,2010-01-10 19:46:00,584,i will be coming from Champlain st parallel with the QEW at Stevenson rd.  All your help is appreciated guys!!
420785,Sinker,2010-01-10 19:50:00,8692,"I'm assuming you mean the 401, not the QEW? LOL  If you need more help with the directions, shoot me a pm and I'll get you the proper directions from where you'll be. I'd still hit the bog though if I was you...............lake simcoe is less than an hour away too.........for perch on the east side.  S."
420838,charlied,2010-01-10 22:12:00,584,"ya i meant the 401, so use to saying the QEW...LOL.  The problem with going to the bog or simcoe is I only have about 5-6 hours of fishing time, if that...lol.  Unless someone wants to meet me somewhere near the BOG and take me out fishing to a good spot, I may be all for that...LOL.  I have to contact another member still about icing steelies thou."
421012,GBW,2010-01-11 03:39:00,8460,sorry I wasn't able to help out fish (kids).... So how did you do and where did you end up?
421046,charlied,2010-01-11 05:34:00,584,It's not till next saturday!!  To cold to go out this weekend....LOL.
