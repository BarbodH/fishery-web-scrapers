420702,trapshooter,2010-01-10 16:23:00,1234,tough one.  still beats riding the couch all day.
420731,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-10 17:25:00,0,amen to that.  the afternoon was actually gorgeous weather!  too bad the fish didn't get the memo we were coming!
420737,hendrix,2010-01-10 17:40:00,61,"tough morning for me as well, after walking for 20 minutes on the ice wee realized we forgot the reels in the car, my friend forgot his new license at home, and the auger was barely working. and yes, skunked again at least i know we're not alone"
420740,kickingfrog,2010-01-10 17:45:00,8333,"   No wonder there are soooo many fish ""up there"".  You know what they say: A bad day fishin'....  One good hour on the ice and all those troubles will be forgotten."
420743,anders,2010-01-10 17:58:00,1168,"crappy deal man.  we had solid ice where we were fishing...a good 12 inch...no slush nothing, hope over to another lake and slush galore, could almost push the auger through without turning.  Were you in the park?  I will give a low down tomorrow about the day."
420877,Eazy,2010-01-10 23:18:00,260,Seems to be alot of recent skunkings lately......myself included!
420892,vinnimon,2010-01-10 23:52:00,2593,"Same for us in the southern end.Lots of fish attracted and seen on the aquaview.the only ones that nibbled were tiny smelt nibbling on our minnows.The pickerel had there noses to the bait.The shad swam happily around.Attracted a monster bass and a chromie.Even the perch and bluegill sat cautiously.we were using the hotest thing going and switching to old favorites,with stingers and all.You name it ,weve tried it.Maybe a drop in pressure could of done it.  It was hard fishin for sure,the aquaview kept us entertained for sure."

So there went Saturday's fishing, Today was spent digging out. Too cold to go fishing today now that the cold front moved through. Froze my butt off out in the yard running the snowblower for almost 2 hours in -40 windchills!!! YEAAAAY!!! Next week is looking good so far though."
421020,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-11 03:49:00,0,"i'm anxious to see some reports from your ""MAP FULL OF LAKES"" for sure.  how do you even choose?"

421294,foggynotions,2010-01-11 22:27:00,21,"It was an ok weekend of fishing up at Ranger Lake area too, we went up north of Saymo to a few lakes, we all limited out on lakers, no specks this weekend.   It took us the whole day to limit out,  the fish weren't hitting too great.  The morning fish never really turned on, but the evening was good, we all got decent hits and all limited out at around 4pm.  After that...hit the trails home and filleted and chowed down!"
