420143,Terry,2010-01-08 20:59:00,14456,"just when I'm with Lloyd he's a jinx, you know"
420148,irishfield,2010-01-08 21:20:00,26272,Jealousy is a wonderful thing...   Bringing that tomorrow so you can see what's not biting your hook... correct!  
420155,Terry,2010-01-08 21:38:00,14456,sure I can do that
420156,canadadude,2010-01-08 21:46:00,769,"hey dude your toy's are your fun, keep it up if it ehhances's your fishing experience then go for it and love it, me I don't need it"
420158,Terry,2010-01-08 22:01:00,14456,that's what you should have said the first time..to each there own  or maybe I am just having a bad hair day
420163,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-08 22:28:00,10439,"  Looking at your avatar picture that would be every day.  Are those Marcum colour cameras as nice as they look? Can you actually see them when using them outside of a hut? Do you think they are worth the huge $$$$ they charge for them?  I have a 5.5"" cabelas and while it works pretty good, it's useless when used outside of the hut. Just may too much glare."
420164,Terry,2010-01-08 22:31:00,14456,"yes you can see fine outside the hut as I was all that morning I neever had the hut over me, just used it as a wind break if I had to do it again I would buy the black and white MarCum most of the time there isn't enough light for the colour to show"
420186,phiphntek,2010-01-08 23:16:00,115,"cool vid Terry.....without guys like you with their high tech ""toys"", guys like me would never see what goes on down there.I think I saw a couple of those perch laughing at ME.Im gonna get em now though..............."
420447,johnnyb,2010-01-09 20:29:00,3413,"Nicely done, Terry!  If LakerJessy sees this post, she's going to want to go fishing with you again though...all those toys"
420519,irishfield,2010-01-10 00:58:00,26272,Nothing wrong with a women that likes toys Johnny !
420525,Michael_Brown,2010-01-10 01:06:00,411,Offside!      Two minutes to irishfield for unsportsmanlike conduct.
420552,Terry,2010-01-10 02:07:00,14456,LOL
420777,jaydub,2010-01-10 19:32:00,145,Awesome video Terry!  That is way different than what I would have pictured going on down there.  I was out on Cooks Bay yesterday and when I'm not getting bites I just assume that there are no fish around...not necessarily so.  Really shows the importance of doing a little jigging and not just leaving the bait dangling down there.  How deep can you record with that thing?  I look forward to your White Fish and Lake Trout vids if you do get around to taking some!  Thanks for sharing!
420808,irishfield,2010-01-10 21:13:00,26272,  Geeee Mike... would this be a bad time to say she's slept in my bed too...
420842,Terry,2010-01-10 22:13:00,14456,"ah... no not a word, here"
420845,SlowPoke,2010-01-10 22:22:00,2984,  Nice camera! The fish look as if they just jump off the screen!  Toys are fun. Enjoy.
420849,irishfield,2010-01-10 22:30:00,26272, Well Johnny was with her of course... 
420870,Terry,2010-01-10 23:01:00,14456,they have a name for that too...LOL
420881,Governator,2010-01-10 23:27:00,879,went out at gilford this afternoon for a couple of hours and caught SQUAT!!!!  I did see a pike below the hole and a flash of maybe half a dozen perch go by.  Other than that a whole lot of nothin!
420882,Terry,2010-01-10 23:33:00,14456,"that's too bad, I have the odd bad day myself the key is to keep moving till you find them"
421096,kmarr,2010-01-11 15:55:00,11,cool vid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
419709,Terry,2010-01-07 23:16:00,14456,"Today was the day to take all the equipment out for a test drive  cooks Bay seemed like the place to go  Loaded up a heck of a lot of stuff and off I went  I was surprised but how many vehicles were already parked by 830 am on a Thursday, but there they were.  the skidoo smoked a bit at first but ran great, stopped at 21ft of water dropped a line the fishfinder and the camera right away there were lots of perch swimming around, so I set up the recorder. Wouldn't you know it as soon as I got the recorder recording all fish had swam away  but 5 minutes later they were back and now I have 2 hours for perch recorded..don't know why..LOL  I did a lot of playing around watching them attack and miss or sneak up and nibble it I was surprised how far they have to move before you feel the bite.  I kept about 15 for a meal and let the rest go it was a fun morning on the water and all equipment checked out just fine...except I left my lunch and coffee in the truck. better then forgetting the fishing rods I guess   got back to the truck and I don't think there were any parking spots left in the area  here is a short clip of the fish, I will post the long one when I am fishing making it small enough to be up loaded           "
419712,irishfield,2010-01-07 23:21:00,26272,"Priceless. the music goes ""see you next week guys"" and you rip one to the surface !"

419728,discophish,2010-01-07 23:41:00,392,That's an amazing video.  It's better than the clips they use on the manufacture's site.  We'll be using a camera for the first time this weekend.
419730,Joeytier,2010-01-07 23:44:00,3990,That's one hell of an electronic set up ya got there. Nice report.
419733,lew,2010-01-07 23:48:00,12766,"Jeeeez Terry, you carry more fish'n gear on your Ski-Doo than I carry in my boat"
419734,Terry,2010-01-07 23:48:00,14456,"yeah but it takes two trips with the skidoo to get everything to the fishing spot...LOL ok not really, but I do like my toys..."
419757,Dano,2010-01-08 00:22:00,719,Nice Terry! I guess finding parking on the weekend is nearly impossible. I should just move up north.....
419784,bigugli,2010-01-08 01:19:00,6138,Sure is neat to have the camera.  I would be totally hypnotized watching that on the ice.
419798,Terry,2010-01-08 01:47:00,14456,if you have nothing better to do for 9 minutes  
419799,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-01-08 01:52:00,0,"WHAT, NO HD TV AND BEER FRIDGE?"
419893,Joeytier,2010-01-08 04:14:00,3990,Check the moonwalk at 3:57
419904,irishfield,2010-01-08 04:26:00,26272,Shows what many don't comprehend in a big lake... that's current !
419913,muskeybugged,2010-01-08 04:44:00,282,"Thats awesome, I love you perchin video's....But...... If you have a wicked awesome camera like that do you need the finder also?  Oh I see now, all in one rig.....  That's a Marcum what model?"
419949,Sinker,2010-01-08 05:54:00,8692,"Cool vid! have you made any whitie vids? I""d love to see what they are doing down there!!  S."
419973,Terry,2010-01-08 11:46:00,14456,"it's the 825c I did not use the fishfinder today I have not used it on whitefish yet I am hoping to, recording on it isn't easy and I can't monitor what it is recording so it doesn't always work"
419994,corvette1,2010-01-08 14:12:00,1765,terry that video was cool
420010,cityfisher,2010-01-08 16:10:00,959,nice vid terry..ill be out on Sat to test out the sled
420018,The Birdfish,2010-01-08 16:27:00,73,"Great vid and love the set up, hope to have similar one day,  good fishing"
420076,fishnsled,2010-01-08 18:56:00,3520,Very cool Terry.  Any more gear and you'll be need a semi trailer to haul it all around.
420109,Terry,2010-01-08 19:52:00,14456,"LOL  well I did say I was taking the equipment for a shake down test I don't always take every piece of equipment with me, this was to see what works and what doesn't work    ok I do take it every time and I need to buy a bigger hut to put it in"
420121,canadadude,2010-01-08 20:11:00,769,"I fished gillford, 21'  of water on Wednesday, no camaera, no fishfinder and ended up with 20 keepers, the boys with all the electroninics ended up with less to nothing. I see these dudes with all the crap and spend lots of $$$$$ all on the pooo, my sugestion is learn how to fish, learn how to grab keepers. If anything grab a cheap fl8 flasher that unit will tell you all you want to know. freaking camaras are a joke, one time in 30yrs ice fishing did a camera ever help me out and that was on Scugog looking for a weed break. the camera definitly helped us out, other then that it's been alot of wasted weight"
420129,Terry,2010-01-08 20:24:00,14456,"in your opinion ...  why would dudes waste their money on cheap Loomis rods I could have had a limit of keepers if I wanted , I kept the amount I wanted and released the rest..if you really know the area you don't need electronics but a good fisherman with electronics will out fish anyone without it every day of the week...  as for the camera it's a toy it's a fun toy  I like playing with it, I spend too much time watching it when I could be catching fish, but that is what  I want to do...  your thing seems to be numbers of fish to brag about, I go out for fun, some of which is catching fish, some of which is playing with toys and some is standing around talking to friends some of my best days on the ice I only picked up my rod a few times  you go do you thing I will will joke with my camera and have fun .....  think I will pack my waste of weight for Saturday"
420141,Ron,2010-01-08 20:58:00,1683, It's all coming together now..... I understand why you don't catch fish through the ice now! ha ha ha
