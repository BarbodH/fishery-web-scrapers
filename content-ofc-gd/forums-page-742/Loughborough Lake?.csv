Was thinking of seeing how the ice is near the division st. boat launch, just wondering if anyone has been out on the ice there recently? I have only fished this lake in the summer, and it was years ago. I hear the ice there can be safe in one spot and soft in the next.  So if you were out there how was the ice, and how was the bite?  Not sure what to do this weekend, its either back to the Bay of Quinte to find a good spot or maybe Loughborough Lake.. Hmmm"
