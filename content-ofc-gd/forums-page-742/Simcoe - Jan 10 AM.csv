420857,icefisherman,2010-01-10 22:39:00,952,"Well - First ice trip for the year, first report, tons of fun and laughs with s great friend of mine and lots of fish for a good measure too today ha ha ha. Here are the Stats:  - over 15 fish caught and lost at various locations in the column, including 4 right at the hole - 7 brought to the ice (5 of them released to grow bigger;-) - lost track of how many bites I missed while laughing and playing around - between 70 and 80 fow, right off the bottom. -4 of the fish caught were natural - No lakers so far  Wiliams did 90% of the damage...got some on Meegs but they seemed to love the Williams today. Over 6"" of ice where we were. Fished from 9am to 1pm Good company, bit windy but sunny...great start of the season...maybe going back again soon. Trying to use as fully as possible the remaining part of my vacation.  Few shots from the day:  Fall of the bucket while getting this one on the ice      Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
420861,skeeter,2010-01-10 22:45:00,1907,NICE REPORT that sure looks like you had fun in the first pic
420863,irishfield,2010-01-10 22:49:00,26272,Great stuff Emil... good to see you out and about.
420866,crappieperchhunter,2010-01-10 22:51:00,2582,Well done Emil. Thx for the fish porn. My buddy and I got ignored by perch at Port Bolster this morning. Glad to see someone got bit today.  Be more careful next time around those buckets. I don't think telling the boss you need to take some time off work because you had a bucket accident is going to fly

420889,tibbs,2010-01-10 23:45:00,650,Nice Catch! Sounds like you had a blast.
420898,jaydub,2010-01-11 00:05:00,145,Looks like a great start to the deep hardwater season!  You had about the same results in the same amount of time in 90fow as we did yesterday on simcoe in 20fow...needless to say your results look much more rewarding.  I look forward to going for whites and lakers in the next few weeks!!
