421331,Joeytier,2010-01-11 23:34:00,3990,I'm looking to replace the 12 v gel cell battery for my Humminbird fishfinder that died recently.  I'm just wondering whether there will be any problems purchasing this http://compare.ebay.com/spid/29529017?fl=2...sShippingLowest as opposed to a Humminbird battery.  Thanks.
421337,DRIFTER_016,2010-01-11 23:42:00,10439,Should be no problem as long as it fits. I have a total of 8 batteries for my electronics and they're all the same size.
421340,Terry,2010-01-11 23:45:00,14456,yeah that's fine if there is an alarm company in your area they should carry the same thing
421342,Sinker,2010-01-11 23:46:00,8692,Osso electric sells them. They're on Bloor St at Ritson Rd in oshawa. Any electrical supply store will sell them. I usually get them for about $15.  S.

421346,Joeytier,2010-01-11 23:56:00,3990,Thanks for the replies.  I figured there was a cheaper alternative to buying the 50 dollar Humminbird battery.
