Muskie-Bait very soon afterward say gay man-st ""Phish On""  I told him no that's bait this is what you want to catch, and brought in this purtty kitty   Now we weren't the only ones catching phish but Slug, and Shovel released theirs before I could get a pics of their Rockies, and SM, very small SM. Seem to die down we headed up steam to the falls, and while having a light snack caught this pesky widdle fellar  Also caught someones lost anchour, thank you very much, I give it to WD who lost his last week, since nothing was happening here we moved back down stream, and Shovel landed a pesky widdle fellar  Well he was having a field day 2 SM, 24 Rockies, and a Crappie don't know why he was trying to hide   ~~I have to say muskie-Bait was also having a great day with the Kats, almost lost him over board till I made him sit down and fight it, safely,  and he followed it with another, and you should have seen the belly on it . Wasn't long before I had another one on after just losing one, my final for the day  Here's 2 short videos of Shovel fighting, his first Channel Kat, with Missy coaching   Shovel  first Channel Cat       ~~All phish were released, to be caught next year, total count 10 cats on 7 landed, 2 eyes,2 SM, 2 perch, well over 3doz, rockies"
