210192,Fishnwire,2008-06-03 13:30:00,983,Has anyone seen the Humminbird fishfinder/gps combo at costco?  Anyone know if it's any good?  It looks a bit crappy.
210215,Stoty,2008-06-03 14:08:00,2910,"If its a good name like that, I cant see it being THAT crappy. Mind you, there are much better units out there, but as long as its not a no-name unit, it will be decent."
210218,Tacklebuster,2008-06-03 14:14:00,303,"owning a humminbird myself, and having used a variety of other humminbird fishfinders, humminbird=crap."
210221,BillM,2008-06-03 14:18:00,17367,"It's a 383c no?  Saw it yesterday while at CostCo.  We run Humminbird fishfinders, no problems yet.  Why not search the net for some reviews?"
210395,misfish,2008-06-03 19:25:00,29133,What was the asking price? I see a place in Florida is selling it for 449.
210397,GBW,2008-06-03 19:30:00,8460,"$399.00 on costco.ca and same ""web price"" at BPS"
210398,mikeh,2008-06-03 19:31:00,824,I have only owned a cheap Hummingbird but I had no problems with it.
210401,ozaibak1,2008-06-03 19:37:00,401,I got a hummingbird fish finder that I dont use anymore since it requires the boat to be stationary to actually give a proper picture... sucks but was $140 a few years ago I guess you get what you pay for but its pretty useless.
210405,Handlebarz,2008-06-03 19:47:00,3790,Well last year I bought a 565 and it has been a great unit for me I have not had any problems with it at all I wanted color but for what I wanted to spend I got alot better gray scale I had always liked eagle before this one but I love this hummingbird and will look into another for the bow of the boat either this or next year.
210444,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-03 21:23:00,1362, I have a 565 as well and turned it into a portable unit so that I can use it in the various boats I own....I think it's a great unit for the price..$238 at Le Barons
210469,big guy,2008-06-03 22:37:00,414,"I just bought a 717 model and have been very impressed so far. The clarity and resolution is amazing. I haven't used it in a fishing situation as of yet, just installed it and have done a couple of test runs to make sure I had the transducer located correctly etc. But man, what a difference compared to my 13 year old Magna II. I also like the fact that it's GPS ready. I also bought the speed/temp gauge for it, never had that before. When I took it out on the first test run, the boat got up to 42 mph running across Sturgeon in a chop... I was blown away. I thought the boat did probably 30 (14' Lund with a 25 Merc) but 42 really surprised me.  Heading up to Marten River on Friday for 4 days of serious R&R and fishing, can't wait to see how the new graph performs."
210487,Billy Bob,2008-06-03 23:12:00,5865,"I have a Hbird unit now for 25 years and it works like the day I purchased it. However, I like my Lowrance LMS 520C unit better"
210555,workwear,2008-06-04 01:50:00,592,the boat got up to 42 mph running across Sturgeon in a chop...  i really dont think a fishfinder will give you an accurate speed reading......a 25hp doin 40mph??  i tend to take a speed reading from my gps.......  just a thought
210598,Mike the Pike,2008-06-04 03:51:00,3421,42 MPH from a 25HP that is hard to believe.I had the little wheel on my old boat it was off by 5MPH too fast .  I am getting 32MPH from my 16 footer on the GPS from a 50HP  PM Greencoachdog he likes the birds.I think you can't go wrong with a name like Hummin bird.
210608,Guest lundboy,2008-06-04 04:50:00,0," Yep that speed is probably doable.  My buddy has a 14' princecraft with an older model johnson 25, and he gets 38mph with gps!"
210670,Stoty,2008-06-04 12:36:00,2910," I agree. Thats hard to believe. I have a 16' with a 2007 40 HP 4 stroke, and I top out about 35 mph"
210681,BillM,2008-06-04 12:56:00,17367," Anyone think to ask if the 25HP motor is a 2stroke or 4stroke?  If it's a 2-stroke, that number is easily believable.  4strokes are great down low, but lack the top end power that the 2strokes have."
210713,RangerGuy,2008-06-04 13:39:00,564,I don't see why that speed would be impossible with an barebones 14 footer. I have a 17' Ranger Tiller (glass hull) & a 89 Johnson 60 which gets 37 (GPS speed) with a full tank and 3 batteries and gear in a moderate chop.
210807,big guy,2008-06-04 16:32:00,414,"To all you non-believers.  My boat is a 14' Lund Big Fisherman, no floor (I took it out after I bought it), Minn Kota transom mount and a deep cycle, with a 25 hp Merc 2 stroke, both are 1994 models. The only other noticeable weight is the gas tank and me (250 lbs). I had the motor tuned and carbs cleaned this spring and it is running awesome, it'll also troll down so slow that the speed does not even register. My brother-in-law has a Lund Pike with a 40 hp on it and his graph says it will go 30 mph. On opening day on Moira Lake I easily pulled away from him, no contest. I am not sure if the speed is completely accurate, but it's probably pretty close.  Let me tell you, when I open it up, it flies, I can go from Kennedy Bay to Sturgeon Point in no time."
210933,Uncle Buck,2008-06-04 20:57:00,1000,"I've got 2 humminbirds...  MAtrix 17 and a 727... happy with both...  Humminbird had a bad rep couple of years ago...  price a lowrance with the same features, and it'll be nearly double..."
210951,ecmilley,2008-06-04 21:32:00,2163,If you  like it buy it! at worst it still has a warranty and if you want to get in an evening fish to check it out shoot me a pm (about 20 docks south of Mclarens marina) not usually home from work till 8:00
