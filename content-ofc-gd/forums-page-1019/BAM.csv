210969,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-04 22:20:00,0,Very nice clean and healthy looking brown. Must have been a great surprise. I don't think I have ever hit a trout on a lure yet. Thanks for sharing!
209903,kemper,2008-06-03 00:14:00,2232,"Went down to my local pike hole today, hoping to get some revenge from the big bite off I had last night. Tossing XRAPs for the toothy critters i get SLAMMED. After a strike like that I thought it had to be a big gator...then it started peelin drag...and more drag...and more drag? That is no pike thats for sure, but what the hell is it?!  Got my answer a few minutes later when it broke the surface in all her glory!    A Beautiful hen brown! ...in 8 FOW, with an XRAP. Thats a first for me!  Not the pike I was looking for but ill take it any day, also landed a 15 lb carp that decided to tangle with my X rap...probably not intentionally.  Thats all for today  kemper."
209908,Rybren,2008-06-03 00:17:00,28,Nice fish!  It beats the heck out of a pike any day in my book.
