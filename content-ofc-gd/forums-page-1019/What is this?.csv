211379,limeyangler,2008-06-05 18:20:00,5204,Just wondering if someone knows exactly what kind of fish this is. Lots of them swimming around the shoreline on Lake Wabigoon.               Thanks in advance   Simon
211380,ricoboxing,2008-06-05 18:23:00,398,i think emerald shiners
211388,anders,2008-06-05 18:50:00,1168,that was my guess to....Emerald Shiner....if you google it you will find some images that would clarify that
211391,Puckhead,2008-06-05 19:02:00,377,Shiner.
211392,LeXXington,2008-06-05 19:03:00,1928,bait
211393,Meegs,2008-06-05 19:06:00,249,Emerald shiner fore sure!
211394,misfish,2008-06-05 19:09:00,29133,YEP
211417,FinS,2008-06-05 20:10:00,463,scoop your 120
211419,Hooked,2008-06-05 20:12:00,891,"I agree, emerald shiner for sure.  Good sized one too, get the dip net out and your in business."
211429,Canuck2fan,2008-06-05 20:35:00,1444,Don't hold back netting some either just because you aren't going fishing for a while. Net and salt em if you ever go perch fishing you will thank yourself later. Last year a few times fishing Lake Erie couldn't catch em or buy em so the salted ones were very handy to have. Just remember though salted ones do count toward your limit of 120.
211452,limeyangler,2008-06-05 21:26:00,5204,"thanks guys, looks like its a shiner then...lol  one more question, can you get them in a minnow trap?/"
211459,rickster,2008-06-05 21:55:00,495,put out a trap with either a slice of bread or some dog food and you should fill the trap in no time if they are as thick in there as you say
211466,steverowbotham,2008-06-05 22:08:00,1800,Emerald shiner 100% and they can be trapped very easily. Crumbled bread in a trap PARALLEL TO SHORE
211472,limeyangler,2008-06-05 22:15:00,5204,"thanks again guys, i will take a look at making my own minnow trap, Rick they were thick there last night, never seen so many baitfish anywhere before on Wabigoon, a couple around today like i said, but the water is so murky its dificult to see more than a couple inches down, trap will be interesting experiment."
211508,FinS,2008-06-05 23:09:00,463,  then u should see the herring(ciscoes) we catch in the fall lol
211521,Rich,2008-06-05 23:31:00,3927,Emerald Shiner for sure
211523,danbouck,2008-06-05 23:35:00,4380,You are sitting on a bait gold mine!
