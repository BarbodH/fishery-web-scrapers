211441,albany_guide,2008-06-05 21:01:00,23,Hey everyone  I just recently got into carp fishing.  Man is it ever fun.  I have had some good luck fishing with corn nibblets in a river near Owen Sound.  Just wondering if there are any other carpers in the area that want to get together.  I don't really know many spots and would like to learn from some more experienced anglers.  Cheers
