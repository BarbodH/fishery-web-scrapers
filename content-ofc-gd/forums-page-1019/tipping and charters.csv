211069,Gerritt,2008-06-05 00:58:00,6129,"I know I said I would'nt but I just cannot help myself..  I manage a custom home builder... when I hand you the bill of 1.9million.. I would like my ten percent tip please.. JUST FOR DOING MY FRIGGEN JOB!... Yes thats right I want my 10-20% tip  Get real these guys CHOSE to do this as a profession, they set their rates so as to earn a profit.. dont give me the Bull about insurance, docking, employee wages etc... as these are pretty much set expenses and are known... so the point is mute.  Cant turn a profit without tips? it is called bankruptcy.  I would have little issue to offer up a few loonies to a kid making 4.95 (below minimum wage) serving me my supper.. as I know the kid gets the $$ directly and not his manager/boss, that is make the real money... only if I was pleased with the dinner.. if the kitchen screws up? no tip..  But I will be damned if I will tip someone for doing their job. Dont like the pay?? get out of the profession  PS how many of you HONESTLY report your ""tip"" as income to revenue Canada?  I provide a service... and am damn good at what I do.. i easily deserve a 190,000.00 tip... fair is fair right?   Here is a tip for you.. dont tip.  G"
211075,Zubris21,2008-06-05 01:18:00,563," I agree 100%, prices are there for a reason.  There shouldn't be any extra 'hidden' fees."
211096,BillM,2008-06-05 02:03:00,17367,"So I guess none of you guys tip waitresses or waiters?  The price you pay is what you see on the menu?  What's the difference between a waiter/waitress and a 1st mate on a charter boat?  If both hourly wages are below average because they depend on tips to make up for it, why not tip the 1st mate?"
211102,Stoty,2008-06-05 02:28:00,2910,Well said Gerrit!!! Well said!!!
211104,Fisherman,2008-06-05 02:32:00,7201,"The thing is that ""tips"" were originally intended ""to insure prompt service"" in the food industry, maybe the clients aren't the ""cheap"" dude's"" as someone else mentioned above, maybe the Captains the cheap pr---(thorn) for not adequately paying their employees."
211124,Jen,2008-06-05 02:53:00,833,"  This thread has been interesting to follow... It is amazing how much controversy the issue of tipping can cause.  When I do something that I truly enjoy, and someone else has added to that enjoyment by working hard to ensure that I leave happy I think nothing of putting in a little extra to say THANKS>  That truly is what it is all about.  However in saying that, I mentioned that my son has been working on Fishmasters boat as a mate.  His wage is reasonable and he is learning and that is what keeps him happy.  When at the end of the day he receives a tip from one of the clients it tells him that he has done a good job. That is what being in the service industry is about... Doing a good job!  Going above and beyond.  There is nothing wrong with letting the people that make your experiences a little better know that you appreciate the effort they put in.  From what I can tell this thread has jumped all over the place from tipping Mates, to the cost of running boats and charters... the original questions was "" What is the going rate for tips?""  To answer that ... Tips are given not expected... So it is a personal choice...made differently in each and every instance...  Cheers,  Jen"
211152,jace,2008-06-05 08:54:00,472,"In this country, you tip what you want, when you want, if you want.  Every person should follow their own standards.  I'm sure that if you didn't tip them, you wouldn't be the first nor the last.   I personally tip well when the person puts out effort to make sure everything is good with me whether it's a service or product.  It's the same reason i shop locally for most fishing gear, the personal service is worth that extra cost.   Do you have to tip the charter, no.  And i wouldn't if the guy just sat on his ass and ignored me the whole time we were out.  But if it was good service, i would tip well, just as i would in a restaurant.   A friend and i frequent a local restaurant going back to our university days.  (Mel's Diner  heh)   Some of the wait staff is amazing, some are mediocre.  The best ones we eventually got to know well and tipped them accordingly, sometimes up to 25%-30% of our tab.   I don't have a problem with that, especially knowing how certain jobs pay less and they're busting their butts all day.  2 other comments on things i read in this thread.  -it's a myth that tips is an acronym for ""to insure prompt service"" ...more importantly, it would be wrong even if it was it should be ""ensure""  -people who think the charter boats, with rates like those, must be raking in money hand over fist couldn't be farther off.  I personally know about 5-6 serious charter people and guess what....they all have full time jobs.   Like others have said, it takes a whole whack of money run a full service charter boat.  If you think you're going to attract a lot of charters by tossing clients into a 17' open skiff with no amenities, you've got another think coming.   My friends who do this run boats between 26' and 36' with a full head, heated cabins, bunks, full instrumentation and they all tell me that the chartering basically keeps their boats in the water for free most years.  i.e. it pays for itself + maintenance and not much more."
211250,capt bruce,2008-06-05 14:19:00,820,"I thought I was done here but I will try again . First let me tell you the best tip I ever have recieved is the return Business of some of my 10+ years custermers these guys who come back year after year  is the best tip I can recieve.As Jen said I NEVER EXPECT to be tipped , I have not caught a salmon myself yet this year and of all the hundreds of fish that went into the box last year maybe one or two were mine , I learned a long time ago I love the hunt ,I love finding the fish ,day in day out, all kinds of condishions, the fun comes when the plan comes together and I see the faces of the people who truely in joy the chance to catch a fish of a life time (and on my boat you have that chance), THATS MY TIP !!! Now for the deck hand he spends all day (most days if we do a double it will be 14 hours )with people he dosnt know and would never met otherwise and he gets paid a fair wage for it (IM not cheap I pay fare) yes BUT he can make or break a trip . How about getting thrown up on by a seasick custermer whos allso not your idea of a GREAT GUY, hooked in the leg arm or ass,cleaning up an accident in the head,or he can help you land that fish of a life time etc etc I can tell boat stories all  day,and if he miss netts your PB !!! . FOR THIS OVER AND ABOVE he USUALLY gets tipped (as I said I hire students from sir sanfod fleming takeing fishers courses , I give them a room aboard the boat for the summer to live and they get first hand experence with fish and can earn money for school)He does not expect to be tipped but I will tell you HE APPRECiATES every cent  of it ,(would he do a lesser job if he wasnt tipped ,NO NO NO and more NO not on my boat) as for the amount I dont think it matters to him as much as the fact he got tipped ,that his job was 110 percent ie better than just what you paid for and was reconized , if you do tip ,tip what you feel is fare.  AND as an aside for GERRITT I tipped the guy who built my deck , he did a great job over and above what we had agreed (a ffair price at the time but when I saw the finished job I was so impressed) and i grave him a few hundred more for a job well done , I thought it was fair."
211340,Tybo,2008-06-05 17:04:00,1373,"I'm one of the cheapest dude's you will ever meet. I would not even think of tipping the owner/ operator. They have already calculated there cost to make a profit. As for the deck hand I have and will tip.  Back in the 80's I had a friend that ran a charter on lake O. From time to time, he would take me out for free and I still tipped the deck hand."
211401,Terry,2008-06-05 19:33:00,14456,"thank you Gerritt, you said it well and I do agree with you 100%"
211473,steverowbotham,2008-06-05 22:15:00,1800,"It's funny how different everyone is.  To each his own.  A tip is not a requirement, its a personal choice, and often a ""thank you for doing a good job"""
211476,Meely,2008-06-05 22:18:00,282,Ahhhhh.....the ole tipping debate......  I think Mr Pink stated it best....lol  Meely
211512,Slayingm,2008-06-05 23:19:00,204,Interesting question....In all the Guiding Fishing Adventures I have done of the years I get as much as $100+ in tips or as little as Zero!...  I always go out of my way to exceed my customers expectations and 990% of the time get tipped but never do I expect it.  I think it comes down to the client experience in terms of what they learned.. how may fish they caught.. how they were treated etc.  .... Greg.
211540,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-06-05 23:52:00,1362,  Ditto....can't agree with you more!!!
211542,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-06 00:07:00,314,"Why let other people's opinions decide whether you should tip or not?  You let others pick your wife, husband and job to?  If you feel its right to tip and have the money to burn............tip  If you dont ..........dont....  Now ill please take my tip for the wise advise"
211601,scuro,2008-06-06 02:45:00,386,"Thanks for your insights everyone, in particular the viewpoints of those who run charters."

210533,forrest,2008-06-04 00:46:00,1032,"If the mate makes *$ an hour thats say 80$ for a long day.....tipping him 60$ seems a bit high.  $20-$40 if they kick butt?  A self respecting captain would be embarrassed by a cash tip.  A captain owns the boat and business.  He will hike the price if its required, the guy does not need your charity and has a vested interest in doing his best every time for the sake of the business.  I do not know from experience but from the sounds of it here he might be making a better living than most.  When I do computer work for people I do not think I should get a tip for doing a good and fast job.  I get paid the set rate.....no tips welcome. Whats next?  Tipping mechanics? The plumber?  Just my opinion.  forrest"
210624,splashhopper,2008-06-04 10:47:00,2931," umm... maybe read what I put in brackets>>  ""Now lets take a look at estimated rates/hour for the following (self employed with all its associated risks): Auto mechanics - Plumbers and Electricians - Heat and Air con guys - Carpenters - Tile setters ""  ... BIG difference in risk and costs for self employed trades was my point.  ie: no guaranteed paycheck at end of week... usually no benefits...Fully self paid retirement... pays own business and disability insurance... not entitled to Unemployment Insurance benefits in slow times... can be difficult getting mortgages and auto loans etc.  Splashhopper"
210665,Stoty,2008-06-04 12:31:00,2910," You're flying in the wrong direction! My rates arent even close to that.  Didnt mean to start anything in this thread, I just dont see the need to tip when you're already paying them about $100/hr to take you fishing. Sorry if a few of you took offense to that, but its my opinion.  Dan - you tip them because they make less than minimum wage. Thats a far cry from $100/hr.  But again, just my opinion. Dont mean to ruffle any feathers."
210727,BillM,2008-06-04 13:50:00,17367,"  Bob, yanks are known to not tipping very well at all   A few of my friends in the service industry can attest to this, lol"
210736,Headhunter,2008-06-04 14:06:00,5703,"Art, well said... to the others who have obviously not ever taken out a charter, have not worked a charter and have no insight into the business... you have shown you ignorance on the topic... perhaps you should hold back your comments, until you've actually experienced it! Every charter I've been on I have seen how hard they folks work and have seen the cash outlay they have made in order to provide the customers with the best possible fishing experience. Funny, I have a good buddy who charters and he tells me his business is driven mainly by the good folks south of the border, mainly because Canadians just can't wrap their head around paying to go fishing... which seems to be verified by many on this thread. HH PS... I for one certainly prefer the $150,000.00 boat, when I'm out on Lake O in 5 footers!"
210738,John,2008-06-04 14:07:00,2956,"OK, I'm not going to reply to any specific post here, but, I think that some of us are missing the point.  Tipping, in my humble opinion, is a reward, or a thanks, for a job well done, and...........certainly, is discretionary. Not as an incentive for better service now or in the future. That in itself automatically assumes that one expects the service will be less than excellent.  A mate on a charter generally works his or her tail off to make ""your"" day enjoyable. If they don't they generally don't last more than a trip or two. If they do, they are certainly worth 15% of the cost of the day.  I tip relatively well in restaurants, if the service deserves it. If it does not then I don't. I over-tip breakfast waitresses. In general they get stiffed by the majority and by the restaurant owners when tips are left on credit card transactions. I have seen a waitress work her butt off to serve a table of 8 or 10 breakfast then get $5.00 at the end of it."
210759,Zubris21,2008-06-04 14:52:00,563,"I'll start of by saying I've never been on a charter.  I've considered it many times, because I think it would be a great experience.  The reason I haven't gone is the price.  Lets face it, it's expensive to get out there on a charter, and rightly so, the captain needs to pay for boat, dockage, equipment, gas, etc.  Prior to this thread I didn't even consider leaving a tip at the end of a good day.  Consider that what you will, whether it be ignorance of inexperience.  I understand those who are supporting the mate getting a tip and I respect that, and understand.  However it does discourage me even further from taking a charter.  Suddenly it's expected that I tack on another 10-20% of my trip cost.... that could be another $150,  unfortunately my fixed income doesn't allow for that.  I guess it just means that before taking a charter trip, I have to make sure I have lots of extra cash.  Now I'm not griping about tipping the first mate, as it might seem, I can appreciate them deserving a tip.  I do, however, find this whole tipping system to be getting out of hand.  It used to be that the waitress, hairdresser, delivery guy and a few select jobs that got tips.  Anymore I find people are asking for, or getting tips that are completely undeserved.  I'm talking about the tip cup at a convenience store (yes I've seen them) or at a take out restaurant.  I think it's getting a little ridiculous to be honest.  my personal favorite is when you are put in a place where you feel obliged to tip, i.e. the hotel worker who insists on taking your bags to your room, even though you are more than capable/willing to do it yourself.  just my opinion, sorry for the rant. -fwf"
210769,Billy Bob,2008-06-04 15:10:00,5865," HUH, I have seen, experience and heard the complete opposite. And in Europe I hear that you can't squeeze out a nickel from them folks.  Maybe their service is not up to standards to the those Yanks who are not tipping well. Are you referring to restaurant people or some other kind of service ?"
210806,Zubris21,2008-06-04 16:24:00,563,"  Many other cultures see tipping as an insult, perhaps thats why Europeans seem fickle..."
210814,scuro,2008-06-04 16:42:00,386, Europeans don't tip much in their own countries because in some countries tipping is factored into the price. They may tip above and beyond that if the service is excellent. Now that I have put that totally off topic post to bed...can we get back to the topic at hand?  Personally I'd like to only hear from those who work in the industry or use charters frequently.
210835,John,2008-06-04 17:27:00,2956, I think that you have got comments on tipping on charters from a pretty good cross section scuro. On a thread like this you can expect some detours  and can't expect to dictate to us what and what not you would like to hear!
210857,corvette1,2008-06-04 17:59:00,1765,first captains work their butts off most earn their money on erie with the wind you might only get out a couple days a week if you tip the waiter for good service tip the captain
210980,Billy Bob,2008-06-04 22:46:00,5865," WHAT more can be said that hasn't already been said other than if you don't tip don't ever use that charter boat again, cheapskate  You asked"
211003,steverowbotham,2008-06-04 23:26:00,1800,"Like I said, I have been chartering for 4 years.  I have spent a LOT of time on the water learning fish movements and patterns.  In 4 years, I can honestly say I have not had a client go fishless.  This is because of time spent out there, which although enjoyable, is not cheap.  I have set rates, which get me by, but I am definitely not insulted by tipping, especially when it comes time for tuition payment."
210399,Stoty,2008-06-03 19:34:00,2910,"I wouldnt hire you because you have ""the best stuff"". Last time I checked I dont need a $150,000 boat, or dual motors, or $500 rod/reel combos to catch fish.  My $100/hr to fish...wasnt saying its money for nothing, but making that kind of money fishing....probably isnt the hardest thing to get used to. Nor did I say it was easy or short hours, so not sure where that came from??   Exactly!"
210400,Terry,2008-06-03 19:37:00,14456,"I, in everyday life tip for outstanding service, but I don't believe it tipping for ..OK... service, I think many people tip big to show they are a some buddy, to make the statement I could buy and sell you........  I have done guide/ charter service and been on charters and more  then one of them bragged about how much money they made each season, the one lived on his boat all season and Florida in the winter,  I don't like tipping someone who makes more money then me..................  ok maybe I'm cheap   well, if he went out of his way"
210406,scuro,2008-06-03 19:49:00,386,"I'm going on the assumption that the rate offered is the going rate, and that the price reflects a suitable profit for the operator.  There is no second mate with whom I'm booking, as far as I know the operator will be doing: set up and assist in netting the fish, along with the other duties and responsibilities. So I'm guessing tips are typical in this situation. Assuming they did their job well, what tip do you leave?"
210407,Stoty,2008-06-03 19:52:00,2910,"I dont think a tip is necessary at all. He is making his money, and obviously enough to be happy with it. IMO"
210413,danbouck,2008-06-03 20:15:00,4380,It's the same as anything else. You go to a restaurant and tip the waiter every time. They are getting paid too so what's the difference.  If I was paying for a charter I would go with the guy who has the best stuff and if it was a great day they would get a tip.
210420,splashhopper,2008-06-03 20:35:00,2931," As a small business owner myself, I don't think that rate is as great rate to ""get paid to fish"".  Think about this: 1: cost of boat 2: cost of helper 3: boat insurance 4: business insurance and taxes 5: WSIB on employee 6: poles/ lines/lures/downriggers etc 7: dock fees 8: winter storage fees 9: some kind of wage for the owner 10: FUEL costs  As for getting to actually ""getting paid to fish"": On the many charters that i have been on over the years with  www.bluegoose.com (Barry Nash) i have NEVER seen the owner or his mate ever put a line in the water for themselves. They were focused on their customers and our desires.   Now as for the actual QUESTION of the thread, we always tipped 10-15% direct to the captain and paid $2.00/fish for each one cleaned as well.   Splashhopper"
210423,Dusky,2008-06-03 20:41:00,310,"$350 between 3of us is around $120 per person for wonderful 4/5 hours fishing in lake “O” which is cheaper then a night out in town. And with the service I get from Bowen it’s worth every penny. Regarding the rate, well someone posted a link here which has link to many charter services in this area and most of them are charging the same $$ irrespective of equipment they have, personally I care less if I am fishing in a 150 k boat or a 50k boat, all I care about is FISH!"
