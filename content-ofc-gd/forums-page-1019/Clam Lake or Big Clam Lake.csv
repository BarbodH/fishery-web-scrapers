It's on Clam Lake, near Kearney, ON It's so small the lake isn't even on google maps, the road is, but not the lake lol Anyone ever fish it?  He says there are no fish in the lake, but find it hard to believe. Any good musky spots near it? Say within a 20-30 minute drive? Pretty sure musky opens up there this weekend as well.  Thanks!"

They are close proximity to eachother so suggest you split the day and fish both the same day.... often when one lake has a slow bit the other is hot.   Good Luck..... Greg."
