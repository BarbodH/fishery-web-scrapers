210815,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-04 16:44:00,0,"Me and Al decided to go to rice for a few hours. I don't like Rice unless the bass are in season and told him I don't have confidence targeting pickerel in that lake. But it was close by and we needed to kill a few hours.  Launched and left the marina. Immediately we are on a weed flat. I find the edge. Alex casts and bang, fish on. A 3lb pickeral. We tried to work the weed line but the weedline is irregular and the wind was brutal! Al caught a LM bass and that was it. We needed to head for cover. Fished behind the islands, sheltered from the winds with no luck.  We tried a few more Islands with no luck. Went back in front of the marina. I hooked a smallie but it shook off. Decided to call it a night. I still had a hangover from the night before and was hungry.  Anyways, we get to the launch and don't we see a guy with a cooler? And guess whats inside? A number of decent sized large mouth bass.........It wont be long till Rice lake's fishing population is devastated."
210817,Stoty,2008-06-04 16:53:00,2910,Uh oh.....here we go!!!!   (Should have thrown the cooler in the lake!)
210818,Squid,2008-06-04 16:53:00,1656,yep mini report for sure. How's the hangover?
210826,Reef Runner,2008-06-04 17:05:00,981,"Unbelievable, well, I beleive ya..just astonished that people still get away with that cow pie.  Especially on a popular lake like rice.  Glad you guys hooked into some fish."
210827,ccmtcanada,2008-06-04 17:08:00,7971,Thanks for the mini report Johnny!  Unfortunately we'll always run into people who will keep out of season fish...knowingly or unknowingly.
210832,johnnyb,2008-06-04 17:18:00,3413,ridonkulous!     But at least u caught some fish -- so that was good
210834,sunfish,2008-06-04 17:27:00,57,"That is unfortunate!  Maybe as fishermen we should be educating those that are not so educated.  I once did not know everything there is to know and till this day still learning, however with the help of the board and research I have been able to figure thing out just fine.  As a group we can try to better our fishery.  My two cents.  Thanks for the report Johnny Bass."
210838,BillM,2008-06-04 17:29:00,17367,Should have just shot the guy and thrown the fish back in the lake.  Problem solved.
210868,snagmaster,2008-06-04 18:16:00,250,yea it was terrible....was looking for the # for the ministry the whole time...that dude should go straight to jail....makes me sick on a happier note....heres the pic of the the Walter that is still swimming and a couple pike Johny and I got in the rain at cooks.       
210886,snag,2008-06-04 18:54:00,1932,"Great report, Great t-shirt  Multivitamins help a hangover."
210907,cityfisher,2008-06-04 19:49:00,959,nice report guys !! Damn poachers !! they are everywhere !
210997,jdmls,2008-06-04 23:20:00,575,"nice job Johnny........I hate it when you get into a walleye  right as you arrive on the water..gets your hopes up and then get nothing else for the rest of the day...truely a kick in the nuts , but its still better than getting skunked I guess...Rice can get rather annoying right know with the weeds coming up everywhere, which adds to the frustration of no fish!!!"
