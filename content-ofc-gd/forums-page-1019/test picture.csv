210579,Guest robw,2008-06-04 03:01:00,0,"I just learned my self. On photo bucket, after you pick the picture, click on the bottom link that says IMG code. That automatically copys it. When you are doing you post, just press paste... and Voila."
210586,Greencoachdog,2008-06-04 03:23:00,8163,Here's me with a nice one I caught on the West Arm of Nippissing last year. 
210590,Mike the Pike,2008-06-04 03:35:00,3421, If you click the direct link near the pic on Photobucket copy.  Then go to OFC click the insert image box the one with the sun and tree right click and paste.  you will see your image directly on your post.  Mike
210604,EC1,2008-06-04 04:19:00,930,"basically putting any image onto the forum is to put a [ img ] and a [ / img ]  (without spaces) around your picture's url . URL is basically your uploaded picture, right click it. and then look for properties...there it willl say URL : http : // www.thisismypicture com / mypicture.jpg  or any link.  pm me if you have any questions about it still"
210609,BillM,2008-06-04 04:59:00,17367,"GCD, did you catch that using marshmellows?  "
210870,msp,2008-06-04 18:19:00,1336,WOW..........I didnt know that there is also a lake in northern Europe called Nippising!!!!!!

210893,johnnyb,2008-06-04 19:13:00,3413,"  Right click on your image on photobucket, select properties, select image URL.  higlight the image URL address, right click it, select copy.  Come back here, click the little ""insert image"" icon, then paste your URL into the pop-up window that appears.  Nice pike, by the way!"
210927,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-04 20:31:00,0,That is one of the longest pike I've seen in Ontario. Small head but nice and long. Was it caught in Ontario?Maybe Ottawa river?
210987,Zubris21,2008-06-04 22:55:00,563,Don't forget there is a 'preview' option so you can check to make sure your post/thread looks the way you want before you actually submit it.
211052,danbouck,2008-06-05 00:34:00,4380, I hope you didn't use a net for that
