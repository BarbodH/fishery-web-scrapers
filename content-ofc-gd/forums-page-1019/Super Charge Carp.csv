209816,dsn,2008-06-02 20:49:00,1018,"I thought I go out and do some carping. Haven't been out cause of the up and down temps.  Saw some carp moving in the pool. So I took out my ""Secret Super Charged Groundbait.    This fish below took a sniff and leaped into the air!! It flew !!! Soon there was an entire gathering all over the ground bait like I have never seen before. And I get my first fish. I couldn't get any action shots til the Super Charged GroundBait wore off. It put up one hell of a fight.   You can see she was thick in the back.    The Super ChargedGround Bait ""RUM Cake!!  Not to mention over night bollies soaked in ""Wiskey.""  I know they make Wiskey Bollies cause I seen them in stores before. Thank Got I don't drink.  I would have landed more fish but they gobbled up everything so quick I couldn't believe it. Faster than corn !!!!  DSN"
209818,bassjnkie,2008-06-02 20:53:00,1101,"WTG!! Good recipe. Nash used to make whiskey, but Nash dosen't want to deal with Canada anymore.  Great job!! Daniel www.ontariocarphunters.com"
209830,Photoz,2008-06-02 21:19:00,792,"I can see the headlines now . . . .   'DRUNKEN SCHOOL OF 40 POUND CARP ATTACK & SINK CANOE NEAR CENTREVILLE! Mayor Miller calls for calm, and is forming a task force to look into the matter!  P. S. Can I get the recipe!"
209897,urbanangler1990,2008-06-03 00:03:00,933,"thats one heck of a recipe, r u really that good of a cook?"
209932,Victor,2008-06-03 00:43:00,1609,whoahhhh!!! i have yet to have a carp jump out of the water during a fight ... dang i gotta add more alcohol to my groundbait/maize ... i probably should soak my stuff for at least 6 months before using them  Great shot as always dsn ... pretty crazy how u got a shot of him jumping .. it's like u can stop time or something...
209948,dsn,2008-06-03 01:00:00,1018,"  Centreville? This wasn't from the island.  As for the recipe I have no clue the peice of ""Rum Cake"" was given to us by a friend. But it sure speeds things up quick.  dsn"
210084,wolfville,2008-06-03 04:19:00,396,"I love carping, but I love whiskey too.... decision, decision, decision...."
210098,danbo,2008-06-03 08:03:00,2646,Is that an arrow hole through the back on that?
210134,Canuck2fan,2008-06-03 11:41:00,1444, Why don't you just buy some maize and ferment that a little...... If then like alcohol so much that should work too. Much cheaper too. I actually had some canned corn I forgot about in tupperware container in the car for a few days and it was bubbling and the fish didn't seem to mind.
210138,ccmtcanada,2008-06-03 11:44:00,7971,As usual....very cool pics!  Loved the taildancing carp.....happened to us only a few times.   They must think they are trout or something....LOL.
210163,dsn,2008-06-03 12:50:00,1018,  I was talking on person who said there was feed store in GTA but turns out it closed down long ago. I don't drive so no access to maize. Except for what I can bum off MJL.   DSN
210188,snag,2008-06-03 13:25:00,1932,You should look into being a professional photographer. The subjects seem to perform/pose for you!
210238,Bly,2008-06-03 14:55:00,1556,"You always post such great action shots!   Whiskey you say....  Hmmmm, think I might try soaking a few boilies before my next trip....might be interesting."
210396,Photoz,2008-06-03 19:29:00,792,"DSN . . . .   if ya got a buddy with wheels, there's Ren's Feeds at 4002 Trafalgar in Oakville, Queensville Farm Supply on Queensville Road, just east of Leslie in Queensville, and another out at Blackstock (10 klicks east of Port Perry) at #7 & Countu Road #57. A 40 kilo bag is runnin' about $12.00 this year. If ya got a place to store it, I could letcha know next time I'm past one of those places, I could getcha a bag, then meetcha down where ya fish?"
210422,Beans,2008-06-03 20:39:00,3339,"Hey Photoz...I guess booze is the reason the carp like our anise extract soaked maize and ground bait...just checked my bottle and it sez ""contains alcohol""..."
210847,dsn,2008-06-04 17:45:00,1018, I don't know anyone who is willing to drive all out just for to get a bag of maize. Besides with a bad back which is on and off would be tought to carry such a heavy load.  Thanks for the offr tho.  DSN
210851,ccmtcanada,2008-06-04 17:50:00,7971,"I hear ya DSN....Bly and I have never chummed an area.....  We let Victor, MJL and Wolfville do that for us....LOL."
210919,wolfville,2008-06-04 20:20:00,396,"  Cliff, I stopped chumming the area long ago.... Those carp need to be on a diet by the looks of things ;-)"
