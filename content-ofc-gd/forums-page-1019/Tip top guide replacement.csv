211300,kickingfrog,2008-06-05 15:44:00,8333,I need to replace the tip top on a muskie stick. I've had no luck finding a big enough guide at the local tackle stores. So it looks like I'll need to order on-line. I've measured the part of the guide that fits over the rod tip and it measures 5mm across (3/16 in). How do I use that info to order the right size guide? It seems that the guides are listed by the size of the guide itself and the of the hole that fits over the rod tip.  Thanks for the help.

211455,musky66,2008-06-05 21:34:00,273,Good supply of tip tops at Hook.Line & SInker in Guelph. Got one there that fit my St.Croix to a T!
