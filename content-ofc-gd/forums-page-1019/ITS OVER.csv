211118,Stoty,2008-06-05 02:49:00,2910,ZETTS GETS THE CONN SMYTHE TOO!!!!!!!!  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
211119,Stoty,2008-06-05 02:50:00,2910,(just had that picture forwarded to me just before the game)   I am just giving the Pens fans a hard time....Crosby was by far the best Penguin.
211131,Greencoachdog,2008-06-05 03:00:00,8163,Y'all put the Moose turds back in the freezer and get your  out fishin'!!!
211139,bucktail,2008-06-05 03:20:00,1857,"Dont want to toot my horn but what the hell I called wings in 6! Stoty to be fair you should change the pic to Malkin, Crosby played ok, Malkin is the laziest player in the league and showed it the whole time. A real low life! Good positional hockey and team depth really showed. Go WINGS!"
211163,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-05 10:50:00,3761,O well looks like it's back to my Maple Leafs. .......
211169,Spiel,2008-06-05 11:02:00,9065,"""ITS OVER""  and the hockey posts will soon follow?"
211197,Mike the Pike,2008-06-05 12:08:00,3421, Now Stoty you are really due to post a fishin report  Now shut up and fish
211201,Stoty,2008-06-05 12:16:00,2910," Yet another bitter Pens fan. Don't worry, there is always next year.   I totally agree, but I didnt pick/create the picture, it was forwarded to me by my buddy (also a Wings fan)."
211212,bullybass,2008-06-05 12:38:00,144,Congrats Stoty on your OFC first place playoff draft victory!!! I got number 2... but that just means first loser... hahaha!!! Damn you Malkin!!!
211213,Marty,2008-06-05 12:43:00,873,Congrats Stoty.   The Wings deserved it.   They are an outstanding team all the way around..  The Pens played hard and what we saw here is a preview of things to come.   This core of this team is ridiculously young and it's going to be fun watching them mature.
211214,danbo,2008-06-05 12:44:00,2646,"Congrats to Detroit, they won by using a total ""TEAM"" effort. Now if ALL the OFC'ers played together,  we would be Champions on the WWWeb!"
211222,Stoty,2008-06-05 12:56:00,2910,"Thanks guys! Appreciate that. Hopefully winning the pool means that people will realize that I am not TOTALLY full of it!  Marty - I totally agree! The Pens will be the team to beat in the next 3-4 seasons, thats for sure."
211246,Puckhead,2008-06-05 14:09:00,377,"Never in doubt - great job by a great team...  Final standings (top ten out of forty) in the hockey pool:  1 Stoty 		6294 - 2 bullpucky	6126 -168 3 Hockey Hooligans 	6101 -193 4 Mike's Pics 	6098 -196 5 Canoeheads 	6040 -254 6 walleyejigger 	5938 -356 7 SlowPoke 	5803 -491 8 Kennymans Pylons 	5780 -514 9 Rob's Robots 	5779 -515 10 Puckhead's Pylons 	5761 -533  Damn you Kennyman!!!  In the battle of the pylons, I lost by 19 points!!!  DAMN YOU!!! (this is me shaking my fist at you)..  Congrats Stoty on a convincing, all Detroit picking, victory!"
211257,Stoty,2008-06-05 14:30:00,2910,Thanks Puckhead! I knew my boys would pull through!
211275,Zubris21,2008-06-05 15:12:00,563,Gotta say I'm happy the wings won.....  Did anyone have a flash back to the world junior gold medal game when Fleury accidentally knocked in the Red Wings 3rd goal??
