211468,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-05 22:11:00,314,Ive been told that if a section your fishing is loaded with Garr pike to move on as no other fish will be there.  Is this true?   Or a reasonable bit of advise?
211479,purekgw,2008-06-05 22:20:00,585,true and kinda not bass will not move for them (guarding nests fun to watch) but they will chase away smaller fish but i seen a carp swim right through a bunch of gar and then feed be hind them
211485,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-05 22:25:00,314,What about Pike and Musky?  Would garr pike detour them to other locations?
211487,jwl,2008-06-05 22:28:00,1056,"the gar will come and go..if it's a big school, sure they will chase some fish out of ther area..some of them gar can reach to be like 5 footers...big pike and muskies and right now bass being territorial won't stray too far..I have seem some pretty big schools of gar swim under the boat, kinda feaks ya out for a few seconds but pretty cool to see."
211491,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-05 22:33:00,314,Seen schools of 15-20 of them today.........    larger ones around the 5 foot mark as u say.   Kinda neat and they do chase your bait.......lol  I only fished spot for a few casts after seeing them since i heard they scare off other fish.  Spot did look prime for pike though.   And wonder whether it would be worth hitting this weekend for musky.
211503,jwl,2008-06-05 22:56:00,1056," just scare the gar out of your hole for a while  , if you cast enough bigger lures at them they will play follow the leader and split, or run the boat around there for a couple minutes.   I have had many big ones chase my lure but never actually hit them, and found that they can spook pretty easy.   Cool to see for sure, but if there are other big preditors around, like I said they won't stray far from thier turf, you will probably spook the spot a bit more than the gar did trying to get them out, give the spot a rest and the other fish will come back, and be on the look out and more agressive.  I have seen guys pull simular tactics for musky fishing and it has worked......go into a big quite spot and ""stir it up"" then sit back for a while and wait for everything to get all quiet again.    This will often stir up territorial fish like pike and muskies which may be spread out a few feet apart in an area..this gets the fish on the move, and mixes a few fish together, in turn causes the fish to be more agressive while trying to claim thier piece of realestate back"
211505,purekgw,2008-06-05 22:57:00,585,i dunno if they would chase off a pike or musky it would depend on the size and if the gar went for em i guess they seem not to bother carp
211510,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-05 23:15:00,314,Thanks for the info.......  Will hit these spots on saturday and see what happens......  I notice the garr's really like the thick thick weeds and seem to be sunbathing.
211513,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-05 23:24:00,3761,anyone got a picture of this fish?

211528,gone_fishin,2008-06-05 23:38:00,481,"i caught one on west lake just a couple weeks ago, was catching lots of walleye and a couple pike in the same spot as well... i would say they have no impact on other fish being in the area."
211529,mattyk,2008-06-05 23:38:00,2110,"i dont think its true. I have several different types of fish that were around a lot of gar. The sauger, and white bass were not affraid of them."
211530,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-05 23:41:00,3761,"What w weird looking fish, the snout of the fish is very long. Neat, never really heard of these fish before. Is there a season for them?"
