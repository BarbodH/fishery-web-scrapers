211620,HTHM,2008-06-06 03:26:00,4082,"I have a Shimano Z-02 spinning reel. The inside under the plastic spool has some rust on it and what appears to be salt deposits. The gear housing is greasy and appears to work quite well yet. The bail moves freely, however it requires a good snap to close  it . Here are some pics:    Would anyone know the approximate age and value of this reel?"

211655,jace,2008-06-06 07:54:00,472,"You need to crank it pretty hard to turn over because it's a manual bail.  I would guess the reel is likely over 20-30 years old, at least that's the last time i saw that sort of non-offshore/surf reel with a manual bail like that on the stem.  Modern VERY high end jigging reels, offshore, and surf reels still have manual bails but not like yours.   Not worth fixing unless it has some meaning to you.  You  can find a better replacement at a garage sale.  I'll bet that if you take off the bail roller, the shaft it's on will be worn down to the phosphor bronze metal, a brass looking metal."
