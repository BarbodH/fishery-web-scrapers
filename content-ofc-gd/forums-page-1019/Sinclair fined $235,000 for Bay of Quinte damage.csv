Thinks men in white vans are out to get him, chicken manure makes PCBs disappear, flying fish are everywhere, and that proper court attire does not involve socks.  It's been a real soap opera so far.  They even had a high speed chase during lunch break on one court day!  I'm sure he'll come up with some other screwball stunt, rather than pony up the $$ and do the right thing.  Hope Quinte Conservation doesn't wait on him to do something."
