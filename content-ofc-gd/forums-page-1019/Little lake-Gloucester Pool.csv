I have checked the regulations and can't seem to find a concrete answer. I'm guessing that since it is on the inland side of the locks, that muskie season opens this saturday, however, I have discussed this with a few other people and have been getting conflicting ideas as to when the season opens. I say this weekend, some others say the third saturday. I would really like to give this body of water a try this weekend for pike and muskie, but if the muskie season isn't open there, I will head somewhere else. I'm just wanting to clarify for myself, and for any others who might be wondering the same thing. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."
