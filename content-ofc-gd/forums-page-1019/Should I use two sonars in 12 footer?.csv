Turns out that with an adapter plug, I can use my little Humminbird Piranha 20 with it as well.  I actually have two of these sonar units, would there be any benefit from having both units operating from a 12 foot boat?  or would they interfere with each other too much?  I know I would like to definitely like having the sonar at the bow, for it would make following weedlines alot easier..."
211461,Doctrt,2008-06-05 21:57:00,141,I did get some interference between the two in my 14 footer until I dialed down the sensitivity and turned the noise filter on the front one.  Seems to have done the trick.  Obviously this is only a problem in deep enough water for the cones to intersect. Good Luck T
211465,Black_Blade,2008-06-05 22:02:00,258,"Honestly, I don't really know if it would be that great of a benefit overall to have the two running...more a case for me of doing it since I can...lol.  The front one is the most important one I'm thinking."
211467,Terry,2008-06-05 22:09:00,14456,"if I had two, I would use them only one at a time the one on the trolling motor is great for following at weed line or to stay on top of a spot  but the one off the transom , is great for trolling with the big motor and for running to and from the fishing spot"
