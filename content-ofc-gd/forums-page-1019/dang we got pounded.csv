All the local creeks and rivers here are a mess.  I can't recall ever having an lightning storm that last as long as this last one, started about 7:30 pm on Tuesday night and didn't stopped until Wednesday morning about 10:30.  We needed some rain but not that much. Today it's supposed to get above 90F...can you say sauna.  Hope everything down you way survived."
