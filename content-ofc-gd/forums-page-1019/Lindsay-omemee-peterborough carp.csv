211423,super dave,2008-06-05 20:17:00,323,Hello.  Can anyone suggest a place to go for carp in the lindsay area?  I go there often to visit the inlaws and wanted a place I can take the nephew for a couple of hours.  I know the main locks in town has some but not having a lot of luck there.  Thanks!
