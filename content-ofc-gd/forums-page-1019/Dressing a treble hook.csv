211004,pikehunter,2008-06-04 23:27:00,1659,"The dressed Mepps are a buck and a half to two bucks more than non-dressed. If you have the hair/fur to do it why not save a buck...if you have the time to do it. Look at the Mepps web site and it tells what kind of fur is used.  I think they use squirrel fur, you can always trap your own and make the project really entertaining"
211013,bassjnkie,2008-06-04 23:37:00,1101," Could buy the fur, but like your idea better."

211024,bassjnkie,2008-06-04 23:56:00,1101,"Thanx, worked out the cost, really not worth it for this one time use, unless you have it, like a fly tyer.  Thanx, Daniel OCH"
211025,wallyboss,2008-06-04 23:57:00,1095,"You can try a vest and a tie, to dress it up.  :whistling:"
211039,pikehunter,2008-06-05 00:19:00,1659,"  Yep, that might be a good idea if you ever go after penguins. Snooty little devils they are, all dressed up in their tuxedos and prancing around with their noses all stuck up in the air like they do."
211148,jediangler,2008-06-05 04:21:00,1923,My brother Joonmoon tied these blue fox spinners up last year and they are killer for pike. They out fish plain spinners at better than 2 to 1.  He has the tying gear from his bucktail jig tying days. I would say that it is worth the cost.
211171,Victor,2008-06-05 11:11:00,1609,"I have been wanting to do the same thing to my spinners as well ... it's too expensive getting the one that's already dressed. Have talked to quite a few people and they said it's pretty easy to do, just that you'll need the equipment to do so ... for a starter kit I think it was around $60-70 at BPS."
