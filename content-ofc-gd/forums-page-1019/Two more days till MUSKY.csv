211080,spoonman,2008-06-05 01:33:00,103,Another Musky opener for some regions only. Where is everyone going? I will be hitting my favorite kawartha lake Saturday for a full day of Musky Hunting. Good luck to all musky anglers. It is going to be HOT. We will see if it turns the fish on. Cheers AL

211092,BillM,2008-06-05 01:53:00,17367,"3 days on the French (Main Channel)  I just want one, or two, or perhaps 3?  Honestly, I just wanna know that my tactics and research into what to fish actually works.. a few follows would really be good for my first official muskie outing."
211098,Sinker,2008-06-05 02:07:00,8692,"Its gonna be another couple sleepless nights waiting for the day to finally get here for me.  I'll be the guy on sturgeon, with the big one on  I'm all rigged and ready to go!!  CAN'T FREAKIN WAIT!!!  Sinker"
