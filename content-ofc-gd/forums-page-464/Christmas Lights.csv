644883,GBW,2011-12-02 17:08:00,8460,"A letter from a husband to his wife after a heated discussion about the Honey-do list:  I guess that sometimes I feel like you are pushing me too hard when you want something.  I realize that I was wrong and I am apologizing for being such a hard-headed guy.  All I want is for you to be happy and be able to enjoy the holiday season.  Nothing brightens the Christmas spirit like Christmas lights!  I took the time to hang the lights for you today and now I will be off fishing.  Again, I am very sorry for the way I acted yesterday.  I'll be home later.  Love you……  "

644906,solopaddler,2011-12-02 18:37:00,8605,Joanne's been bugging me for days to put up the lights. No time 'cause I've been fishing.  This is so ironic you posted this.  I'm going to email her this pic right now and ask her if that meets her satisfaction.  
644915,Rich Clemens,2011-12-02 19:09:00,3131,Easy Up / Easy Down.  That's the way to do it.

The funny thing is there is 1 house between the two, lol. I think I might have to go visit that house and bring them that photo!"
645231,Dave Bailey,2011-12-04 02:00:00,1641,"A guy just a few blocks from us even has his own web site, Wright's Lights. There's 3 houses together on that street who go all-out, they can probably be seen from the space station. They collect for food banks, if you go to see them take some cans."
