644617,Sinker,2011-12-01 18:38:00,8692,"Just wondering how many guys here are into waterfowling?  I'm a hardcore, fully addicted waterfowl nut. Its all I think about from sept till jan every year. I'm out twice a week, no matter what.  How has your season been?  Its tough around here right now, but up until now, I've had a great season, but the general consensus says its been a slower than usual season....just wondering what your thoughts are?  We've killed a few here and there                  S.     S."
644619,richyb,2011-12-01 18:52:00,774,Nice job. I hunt fields and have got a bunch of geese this season. Only 1 duck this year. Normally by now the big flocks of mallards are flying around my area but I havent seen any yet. I have got 2 bands from geese this year. One from michigan and one from Maryland.
644620,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-01 18:52:00,10439,Not a big fan of the taste of ducks and goose but they sure are fun to hunt. I really like upland hunting for grouse and ptarmigan and like the taste better too. Plus they stick around and there are alot of them.
644623,mike rousseau,2011-12-01 19:00:00,4661,birds are behind schedule...  normally we have a huge flock of snow geese out front of our cottage by now... not here yet...  and only the odd small groups of ducks flying by...  normally i hear lots of shots on the weekends while fishing...but not many so far this year...  my brother just got his duck boat ready the other day... hes hoping they are gunna start flying more soon...
644624,NAW,2011-12-01 19:03:00,4022,"Dang Sinker.  I'm envious!  My season started off great.  Lots of action.  But hard to compare to past year because we where in a new blind, and trying some new tricks..  I shut er down at the end of October, because I'm to busy with the move.  My next few weeks will be spent chasing deer on my new property.  I didn't even get my duck blind on my boat this year  I'll love to make it out with you next year, if you ever need an extra gun."
644709,buckster,2011-12-01 23:28:00,530,Wow... Good stuff Sink!  Pretty sad to say but i didn't even get my stamp this season.   Got my deer and a ton of steelhead though   Im sure i will see you soon enough when its time pull a few fish through the ice!
644731,misfish,2011-12-02 00:47:00,29133,Nice shooting Shane.
645064,Sinker,2011-12-03 04:31:00,8692,"Geeze...not many duck hunters here, huh?  You guys are missing out LOL  S."
645066,Leecher,2011-12-03 04:47:00,7832,"Shane, never hunted water fowl before but used to hunt small game and enjoyed it    For me it's just deer and this year yielded a couple of spikes for our group  You certainly have them birds dialed in     Congrats Leechman"
645270,Billy Bob,2011-12-04 10:49:00,5865,"Shane,  Your doing quite well from what I can see.....  Me....just OK so far...     Friday I got out which will be the last time for a while as our season closes on Monday until the day after Chrismas thru Jan 9th....we hunted the Niagara River but soon after we set the decoys it started to snow hard and the birds just weren't flying....we did get on Bufflehead though.   So how long and when does your season open and close....ALSO how many canvassbacks are you allowed....here's only 1 bird...we have a 6 bird limit but only 4 mallards with only 2 being hens, 1 Black Duck, 2 Redheads,  3 Woodies, 2 Pintails and 3 geese except 8 in the early Sept season.  Bob"
