These pictures were from last month from a relative that spends quite a bit of time fishing in Lapland.Im not much of a trout guy and have not researched this fish but Im guessing some kind of Char ?  "
645001,kickingfrog,2011-12-03 00:42:00,8333,Agreed about it looking like a char. My first thought was Arctic char  This site has three chars listed:  http://fish.mongabay.com/data/Finland.htm
645013,dnb_cbr,2011-12-03 01:35:00,61,the fish in the bottom pic has the most aesthetic face i have ever seen on a fish.   What a cutie!
