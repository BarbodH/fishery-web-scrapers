644294,Roy,2011-11-30 15:18:00,13728,"You've got a good site, Phil. Compared to any of them."
644301,Harrison,2011-11-30 16:02:00,2202, I really appreciate that Roy.
644413,SirCranksalot,2011-12-01 00:18:00,3291,"Thx folks for all that info. Looks like  I have a number of options. So it seems that ""Whiskers"" is aka ""Tournament"".  Probably part of the reason why I couldn't find them on Google."
644423,SGP,2011-12-01 00:57:00,23,"Agreed, the Saros F is a very nice reel.  One of the features I really like is the Direct Drive Mechanism (thread in handle attachment) which makes for a very solid feeling reel.  I'm pretty sure most of the higher-end Pfluegers have that feature too.  Quality of bearings over quantity, solid (rigid) body construction and a smooth drag are my main priorities over just one given brand.  One other thing to consider about the Shimano reels, the Stradics and higher have the Aero Wrap II (worm gear) system that provides better line lay/wrap.  This really aids in casting and is a feature normally found on premium quality spinning reel.  I'm pretty sure the Daiwa SS Tournaments (AKA Whisker reels) have this feature too but with no instant anti-reverse like a ""modern"" design reel.  You can drop an SS Tournament in the creek (not recommended) and shake out the water and keep fishing---they are like the AK47 of reels in my opinion.  Just a suggestion, if you can find a deal on a ""last year's"" model Stradic I'd be grabbing that over the Saros but you can't go wrong either way.  Hope this helps you.      "
644426,SirCranksalot,2011-12-01 01:11:00,3291,"  That's the kind I need. I have never been gentle on any gear, fishing included."
642420,GBW,2011-11-23 20:36:00,8460,the FJ is the new 2011/2012 one.  the new FJ cast's VERY well and I'm not going to be selling mine any time soon...
642421,Harrison,2011-11-23 20:38:00,2202, Amen to that.  They take a beating.
642425,cynmar,2011-11-23 20:46:00,169,"Okay, I've got about $170.00 to spend on this reel and if I could make it to Gagnon's I'd think I'd purchase the Sustain 1000. I'm looking for a spinning reel for precision casting on the medium light to light rod for bassfishing. Hoping for something from 7-9 oz, so the Sustain and the Stradic FJ fit right in there. I hate to get Shimano biased in all my gear but damn:worthy: Thanks to all you gentlemen for your input. It has been helpful. Can you order the door crasher reels from Gagnon's and have them sent to you? Mike ??  Bill"
642429,Jer,2011-11-23 20:57:00,1426,"  My guess is no...kinda defeats the purpose of ""door crasher""."
642470,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-23 23:44:00,3761,"Yup, Door Crasher Only. I have seen the bundles on the Compre's and Crucials. There are some nice rods to choose from. We have all the NEW Shimano rods on the floor so they old stuff has got to go. The last to see as the ""Cork"" Generation from Shimano.  There are lot's of reels there for the sale too with pleanty of spinning and a bunch of baitcast reels. Not to mention no tax throughout everything in the store.  http://www.gagnonsports.com/christmassale.html"
642481,Roy,2011-11-24 00:05:00,13728," I don't want to complicate your life here but I'd buy an FI over an FJ anytime. It's a better reel and it's less money.  As far as rods are concerned, I much prefer cork handles so I'd buy up a few of the Shimano rods being phased out. But that might just be a personal preference. Spiel is making my rods now anyhow so I probably won't be helping a retailer much in the rod department."
642498,cynmar,2011-11-24 00:44:00,169,"Thanks Roy, about the rods I have to agree. I much prefer a good cork handle rod over everything. I tried a bunch of rods when I bought my Citica from G Loomis, St Croix, E21, Daiwa, Shimano and ended up with the BPS crankbait rod mostly because the cork handle felt real good in the hand and the action was what I wanted. Unfortunately can't get to Gagnon's so I'll have to see what I can do about a new spinning reel.  Bill"
642524,Gregoire,2011-11-24 02:01:00,1397," I have them both as well. I believe there are at least 2 differences: The sustain has a titanium lined spool, which means the line will come off the spool smother. Also the sustain has a ball bearing on the drag, which supposedly makes the drag smoother. Personally I feel as though the sustain is just a little more refined, and I like the way it looks more as well."
642544,Eazy,2011-11-24 03:13:00,260,"Don't think you could go wrong with anything Shimano makes, personally I wouldn't go over $100."
642560,manitoubass2,2011-11-24 04:06:00,11391,"I love my Stradic CI4, amazing reel!  But I also love my Okumas. I don't think any reel on the market is as top notch doller per doller as Okumas are. Their rods as well.  Just my two cents"
642566,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-24 08:06:00,0,i've long been a daiwa and abu guy but the stradic ci4 has converted me.
642918,capt bruce,2011-11-25 15:21:00,820," I been a daiwa guy for a long time , the few times that I have had problems with any of their stuff have been treated great , most of the troubles (99%) were my or the person I let use them fault not the products and still theyfixed me up . the 700 whiskers will last for ever with  just a little cleaning and a drop or two of oil now and than . All you want in a spinning reel, simple,no fancy gimmicks that will break down on the water , their tough dont explode when dropped  , very smooth drag ,and made by a company that stands behind their stuff ."
642953,capt bruce,2011-11-25 17:18:00,820," Damn Roy just when I was starting to agree with ya (Daiwa) When you have as many rods as I and are stuffing them into lockers storeage boxes etc. 2 or 3 times the Capacity for storeage etc., cork chips , takes in a lot of water when submerged (by accident of course), and does not age well , Im old school and at first was glad to see cork make such a come back , but now looking back I can see why it went away and is now going there again . just me maybe but???"
642962,GBW,2011-11-25 17:57:00,8460,"correct, just ask Spiel how much cork is and he'll confirm it for you."
642963,lew,2011-11-25 18:07:00,12766,"If there is indeed a cork shortage, I wonder if that's one of the reasons some manufacturers are  switching to the split grips ?? Seems like it'd be a good way to cut down on the amount of cork they'd need.  I just ordered a new Compre musky rod for my daughter for Christmas and the split grip is the only way they come now."
642977,capt bruce,2011-11-25 19:33:00,820," Might explain rod makers turning away now ,if indead there is a cork shortage , damn wine guys i guess , but like I said I think there is NEW materials now that shead water better , better grip , cork in the cold can I say slippery , and last the new stuff is LONG LASTING , sorry Speil and guys like ya, I will not need you to repair grips with great big pieces missing . Again eatch to his own but I need things that last with much abuse ."
643164,SirCranksalot,2011-11-26 04:28:00,3291,http://www.sail.ca/e...fishing/?page=3   I'm in the market for a good spin reel as well. Any opinion on the Abu Garcia Soron SX 20 or 40 now on sale at Sail's website? thx
643166,danc,2011-11-26 04:37:00,4677, Damn wine drinkers anyways...
643209,Gregoire,2011-11-26 13:25:00,1397,I have an sx 40. It's a solid reel but I find it a bit heavy and did not find a rod that balanced well with it.
644230,SirCranksalot,2011-11-30 04:41:00,3291,Thx Fishgreg. I'll pass on that one then.    Anyone know where I an buy a 1300 or 700? Basspro or Cabela's don't seem to have them.
644241,Gregoire,2011-11-30 11:45:00,1397,I think the 700 is on sale at Le Baron right now: http://www.lebaron.ca/pdffiles/web_spec/daiwa_nov_reel2.pdf
644259,Harrison,2011-11-30 13:04:00,2202, I have the 1300 in stock.  Popular reel here on OFC!  http://www.etackle.ca/daiwa-tournament-ss-spinning-reel-1300/
644262,Roe Bag,2011-11-30 13:22:00,246, I was in Bass Pro (Vaughan location) last Saturday and they had both the 700 and 1300 on display. I think they were $109 but not positive.
644271,Roy,2011-11-30 14:07:00,13728,Don't forget that the 700 is an ultra-light sized reel.
644293,Harrison,2011-11-30 15:14:00,2202, I tried to paste the 700 & 1300 specs here but they came out wonky. Can be seen at the link I posted above however.
642151,cynmar,2011-11-22 19:49:00,169,"Okay guys, I'm getting burnt out trying to decide on a new reel. I'm looking at a number but I've got it narrowed down to a few. The Shimano SarosF, Pflueger supreme Xt,, Quantum Catalyst pti, and the Okuma Inspira 20. Now, I am leaning to the SarosF, but can't understand the difference between it and the others , and as well, there doesn't seem to be much difference between the Saros and the STradicFJ. Need some direction here, trying to compare apples to apples but for example the Okuma offers 9 ball bearings but the Saros only 3 I think it is. Heeelp,"
642153,Live2fish85,2011-11-22 19:57:00,1633,I am big on Pflueger for my spinning reels. I have owned some shimano spinning and personally didn't care for them. I love shimano baitcasters though. I would say Pflueger hands down but it all depends on your preference. I think for the most part though when you are looking at reels in the same range it is what you like the feel on the best.
642154,mercman,2011-11-22 20:06:00,7054," X2  Go to the store with your rod, and try them for ''Feel''. What ever feels best to you, is the reel of your dreams."
642156,Harrison,2011-11-22 20:10:00,2202,Just to throw another reel into the mix... have a look at the Okuma Trio.  Especially the very popular high speed model.  Best bang for the buck right now IMO.  http://www.okumafishingteam.com/family/284019
642158,Roy,2011-11-22 20:11:00,13728,Never base your decision on the number of ball bearings a reel has.
642179,bassjnkie,2011-11-22 21:45:00,1101,"I not a big fan of Shimano, but I had the Okuma which was so so. I love Daiwa, but I have two Pfluegers and a couple Catalyst reels and love them."
642183,cheaptackle,2011-11-22 21:52:00,849," Finally!  The truth be known!  I must get a dozen inquiries a day for reels with the most ball bearings!  Sometimes the old way really is the best - keep it simple and have less to go wrong, more is not always better!  Smooth bail action, drag adjustment and weight are also important considerations.  An Avocet II with 4 bb seems to me to be as smooth as an 8 bb 300xe (both mitchells in this example) with the biggest noticeable difference being the size of the reel.  Hopefully you're shopping where you can actually handle the reels and feel the differences between them for yourself.  Michael"
642185,zeeter,2011-11-22 21:59:00,92,Stradic...
642189,Gregoire,2011-11-22 22:38:00,1397,"I have a Saros F, a stradic FI a sustain FE and a Pflueger Patriarch. I really liked the smoothness and the weight of the Patriarch, which is similar to the XT, but had an accident and broke some pieces of it. When I contacted pure fishing to order new pieces they said that I could not have parts delivered directly and that I would have to go through the reel repair center. In the past I have encountered problems getting parts ordered for an abu garcia reel. My point is that if you are going to spend 100+ bucks on a reel it would be nice to be able to order parts for the reel if it breaks. Even though shimano's parts policies have changed recently I still think that they are the easiest manufacturer to get parts from. I really think this should come into play when you are looking at buying a better quality reel, as it will last 10+ years if you take care of it. I would go with the shimano for that reason, and as was previously mentioned look for a stradic FI if you can find one. For whatever reason this reel just feels right in my hand."
642195,GBW,2011-11-22 22:56:00,8460,"there have been a few real good points made so far so here they are quick and easy to read (plus my comments)  bring the rod you intend to use to the store.  tis is so you can get a good balance and not be to tip heavy or to light.  bearings and drag.  don't count the bearings and make sure the drag is smooth like butter and it's not made from el-cheap-o-parts.  local shop.  not only can they help you with the reel you decide to go with (as I'm sure they mave even have an older one kicking around that is new in the box that they would love to make a deal on) but find out what brands they can service under warranty and out of warranty.  would you rather drive an hour or more for service or get it done locally?  lastly, by being a regular at your local shop, they get to know you and might offer up some extra info next time you go in for advise (as long as you are a paying customer not a window shopper).  like, what's working best on trib xyz, lake x is slaying the abc123 right now with 321zyx. or they may even just start offering you better than sticker price because you are in there spending your hard earnd money in a store they work so hard at to keep open.  you never know.  but going in blind here and not knowing at your budget I say a Stradic is a fine reel.  have you checked the classified here as well?  I have seen some great deals right here!"
642227,northernpike56,2011-11-23 00:22:00,717,  my last rod they lowered the sticker price $20
642236,Ralph Field,2011-11-23 00:37:00,1018,"If you fish in cold weather than a reel with 5 bearings is better than a reel with 10 bearings. I found this out the hard way while steelheading in cold weather. According to Aikmens ,who repair reels, the more ball bearings the better the chance of failure in cold weather."
642237,Fang,2011-11-23 00:42:00,1330,"keep it old school Daiwa Whiskers in 1300 or light action 700 series. These are tanks, virtually indestructible and have the smoothest drag I've ever fished with."
642240,Roy,2011-11-23 00:50:00,13728, Another super reel. Who'd have thunk it....only 3 SS ball bearings.
642288,lookinforwalleye,2011-11-23 03:37:00,4399,"  There you go again Geoff name tribs, I was going to fish that one this weekend but now there will be 10,000 people there!!!  "
642289,danbouck,2011-11-23 03:45:00,4380,"I love my pfluegers, started with a supreme and quickly switched over, now that's all I use for spinning reels. The supreme XT is a nice reel but so is the Stradic. Buy whichever one feels right."

642294,Henricus,2011-11-23 04:01:00,118,"I have had a Saros for about 3 summers now and love it.  Last winter I picked up a deal on a Ci4 and, yes, it is also a great reel but I still enjoy using my Saros.  Great bang for the buck in my opinion.  Seems like lots of opinions on many reels but the Saros...you can't go wrong with this one if you ask me.  Good luck Rick"
642295,young_one,2011-11-23 04:05:00,620,"For the price of Saros, its a great value. One of the few spinning reels that comes with a spare metal spool. The Stradic and Patriarch is just a little more smooth and lighter. "
642312,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-23 12:07:00,3761,I love stradics. I have a CI4 and a FI Stradic. We have all the FJ Stradic models in now and will be selling at a good price our Stradic FI models...Only have 1000 and 4000 size's tho.(Gagnon's)  Either way if u can go better but once u hit the stradic mark there is no need to go further IMO.
642314,Jer,2011-11-23 12:35:00,1426,"  Hey Mike, any idea what the discounted price will be on the Stradic FI 1000? I've asked Santa for a new reel and had suggested the Symmetre FJ 1000 which you guys have for $115 right now, that fits right into her ""Santa"" budget. If I can upgrade to the Stradic for near the same money, all the better."
642394,Bernie66,2011-11-23 18:29:00,123,I was just on Gagnon's website.  They have the Stradic FI1000 on for $119.99 but only on Dec 1st as a door crasher.  There is a bunch of other good deals on Shimano products also.
642406,Roy,2011-11-23 19:29:00,13728,"And anyone who lives in the area and is not at Gagnon's on Dec 1st to pickup as many Compre rods as they can for $49.99 each, is sick."
642409,Jer,2011-11-23 19:40:00,1426,"Oh man! If I show up there that day, I'll end up with at least 3 or 4 new rod & reel combos betweeen the Stradics, the Compres, the Citicas and especially the Crucials...Oh ya, and a credit card bill I can't afford right now.  What are the chances I can just sneak in just for one of those Stradics."
642418,cynmar,2011-11-23 20:32:00,169,"Okay , can someone help me then, I've gone to the Shimano site and the only Stradic's there are the C14 microline, the C14 and the StardicFJ. What is the difference between the Stradic FJ and this Stradic FI that all you guys seem to have. I did look at the Daiwa Whiskers but it is one ugly reel, has great reviews though."
