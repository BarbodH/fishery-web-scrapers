Close to the top of the line, only eclipsed by the Stradic and Stella models. I went to Hook, Line and Sinker in Guelph and Ray and his staff were great. Brought out the new Stradic FJ for me to look at as well as the Quantum Energy PTi. Gave me numerous tips on line, (going to try the Daiwa Samurai braid), and even taught me a couple new knots, one that I'm going to use a lot. I recommend this store highly. Can't wait to try this little beast out, too bad I couldn't afford the Shimano Compre rod that we put it on to see how it felt. Thanks for all the info guys.  Bill"

645168,cynmar,2011-12-03 22:04:00,169," Yeah, I generally use about 4' of fluro leader anyway. Reel is spooled with 15 lb. braid and I'll put the same # as a leader in Seaguar leader material.   bill"
645172,GBW,2011-12-03 22:12:00,8460,good luck with it and I'm sure you will be happy with it.  there are many stores that need to learn a thing or two from the SMB one's out there and that's CUSTOMER SERVICE!  There is a store out by me and I don't like to shop there because they look down at you if your are not 110% sure what you want.  That's neither here nor there and I don't want you post to go that way but great report on the sale and service!  enjoy it!!!!
645174,mercman,2011-12-03 22:18:00,7054,Enjoy it Bud !!! I love getting new equipment. The planning and research is almost as much fun as when you buy it and bring it to its new home
