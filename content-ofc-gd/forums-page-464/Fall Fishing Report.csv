643925,12footspringbok,2011-11-29 12:31:00,459,"Well it was a good season for sure. With all this rain we're getting I'll be lucky if my favourite pools aren't iced over by the time the water clears.  Anyways I had the itch something fierce this fall and pounded the river bank harder than I have for a few years now mostly with my good fishing buddy Jim. I also tried a couple new things this fall as well. I bought a ""pin"" to do some ""proper"" float-fishing not this half ass spinning gear floating I've been doing since I was 16. Secondly some friends and I got out a bunch of times trolling in fairly shallow for bows. I'll get a little more detailed later.   It seems the salmon have started to make a little bit of a comeback. Its too bad they don't get much respect once they enter the rivers. They really do offer a good challenge to anyone that wants to target them legitimitally. I had a rough start with them, think I lost the first 8 or 9 fish I hooked this fall. Doesn't sound like much but when you're lucky to get 2 or 3 strikes per outing it hurts. Anyhow onto a couple pics.        I got out a bunch of times on the bay trolling with some friends through october. Took a couple friends out that don't fish much. I'm glad we got into some fish for them because now they have the itch too...LOL We experimented flat-lining, rigging, and using planer boards with leadcore. The planer boards with leadcore and spoons did most of the damage. It was cool to experiment with something new and have sucess!  Orange seemed to be the colour they liked the most out there.           We spent alot of time still fishing a great big deep pool close to home. I tried figuring this spot out with the pin but I just kept getting outfished by my buddy and his trusty egg sinker wait and see approach. LOL                    My friend got a Beauty male one morning his new PB. Just not sure the size no scale or tape measure. He was destined to make lots of baby steelehead.    We also did quite a bit of trolling flatfish and casting spinners from shore. Gotta love the violent lure hits.            Prettiest fish of the fall by far too bad the pics don't do it....    Lastly float fishing. Not sure what the big deal about it is. What can I say its a great tool, but I won't be putting the spinning gear away anytime soon.  First one on the pin.           Oh and one other thing. I did have to give up the river for a week of hunting. Didn't have much luck this year but we did sneak away a couple afternoons for some walleye fishing while up on the french.  Tied my PB 27"" walleye.   Time to start getting the ice gear ready....  Thanks for reading."

644020,Rod Caster,2011-11-29 18:55:00,5784,"oh man, great report!! I actually read it once this morning and again just now. That's one heck of a collection of trout and salmon."
644023,johnnyb,2011-11-29 19:02:00,3413,Wow...what a great report!  Some seriously gorgeous fish there....the little 12ft springbok from Nowhere has the mojo workin!
644082,rocheleauc,2011-11-29 22:01:00,205,Very good report! Looks like you had an amazing season.  Thanks for sharing!
644170,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-30 01:34:00,0,Pretty fishies and some nice tanks
644171,MJL,2011-11-30 01:39:00,2427,Very sweet fish  Good point about still fishing. There's a number of spots on that river I'd love to go back and try where I blanked with the float and lures.
644177,BillM,2011-11-30 01:53:00,17367,Very nice man!  I need to get out on the bay for rainbows in the spring!  I've also heard the whitie bite is decent out there as well.
644242,12footspringbok,2011-11-30 11:53:00,459," Thanks but it actually was more like three months...LOL    Thanks Rod Caster!    Some one always gets slimed when the 12 foot springbok hits the water...LOL    Thanks    Just wish I had some better camera skills. We did get a few ""dandy's"" but nothing like those lake O beasts I see some of you guys catching.    Some of those deep slow moving spots with back eddies and weird currents are hard to fish any other way.    We tried the spring whitie bite last year. All we caught were bows...LOL"
644246,rhare,2011-11-30 12:09:00,387,"Great fishing Martin, looks like you and Jimmy put a hurting on them. Some great fish on the kwikies and hardware!   The whities off the mouth is a tough gig. Its totally hit or miss. I can remember being out with my old man when the ice was still floating around. You had to chum them to keep them around. We would also use skien from time to time with good success.   wont be long now and we'll be chasing greasers   Ryan"
644258,ehg,2011-11-30 13:00:00,2666,That is a bunch of excellent fish. Nice late fall for youse.
644261,12footspringbok,2011-11-30 13:14:00,459, Thats funny. I remember floating around the mini icebergs with my old man out there close to 15 years ago now.... There would be about 25 boats out there. Like three of the boats would be absolutley hammering them and everyone was getting skunked...  Greasers.... Yup Started messing around with my ice gear last night. BTW I heard your living not too far away from me. Better be careful or you might have someone else following you to your spots...
