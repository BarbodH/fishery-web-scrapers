643203,Fish Farmer,2011-11-26 12:56:00,2234,"We fished 4 days, 6 guys, 7 Walleye. We fished all 4 days in the Picton Bay, check background. If you think there still in the same spot, good luck with that. Fish move with the wind and their tail  4 fish were caught straight back flat-lining on Reef Runners 260' back, the other 3 were caught using in-lines 200' back 100' out using Tail Dancer, Bomber Long A. 3 fish were in the 12 to 13 LB. mark. 1 10LB. & 3 around 4 to 5 LB. Mon. we caught 5 fish, Tues. 0, Wend.2, Thurs.0 Our other buds, didn't get a sniff.  They figured it was do with trolling speed, couldn't get under 2 mhr. We had snow one day and the winds were up and down. Talked to a lot of guys and they say fishing has been tuff this year, we were lucky to get what we caught. We still might make another trip this year if we can find the time.                            Most big ones had sores all over, enough to turn you off eating anything from there.  Couple guys wanted the smaller fish to take home. I not telling who caught the smaller ones "
