We did some bush whacking to get to the back of the lake where we found 4"" of nice black ice.  Felt good to drill some holes and ice a limit of brook trout.    Funny thing is that I could have been muskie fishing on Lac Seul 2 days earlier, if my boat wasn't put away.  Gotta love NW Ontario!!"
643890,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-29 05:57:00,2582,Beauty fish.  I'm hoping for ice by Dec 17-18th down here....but I'm getting less optimistic everyday.  Thx for sharing that.
643895,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-29 07:27:00,655,"Dang Ben, that's a nice brookie. Can't believe you are already drilling holes! I still have lots of open water fishing left before I drill holes."

643903,solopaddler,2011-11-29 10:33:00,8605,"Right on dude. I'm not ready for ice myself, but if it's brookies like that I'd make an exception."
