644158,Fang,2011-11-30 01:00:00,1330,After a year or so tied to my desk I've got some holiday time in the new year planned. My wife is hot on the travel website looking for a place with the following  warm weather nice beach clean rooms and friendly staff and enough stuff to occupy a 13 and 18 year old  I'm not one to sit on the beach all day and any of the extreme sports stuff like zip lining or para sailing is out  I'll be planning 1 day for some offshore fishing and would love to hear from any members about resorts they've stayed at that had any do-it yourself fishing. Planning to take down a few rods to cast from shore or wade some flats or do whatever.   Thanks guys!
