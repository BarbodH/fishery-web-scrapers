With the Bass season about to close, me and my bro headed to simcoe one last time to attempt to catch some fat bass.  First drift was a success and we managed about 6 total for 4 hours.. Not bad... Lucky to enjoy simcoe on a relatively calm day.  WATER TEMPS were 41 !!  "

644193,solopaddler,2011-11-30 02:57:00,8605,When I read the title I figured you meant the bass in the tank at Bass Pro.  Couldn't figure out why they'd be so hard to find.   Nice tank bass.
