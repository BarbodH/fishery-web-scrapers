I have no idea what the plant is but they produce 1000's of tiny seeds and since they drive my neighbour nuts I always let a few of them prosper in different locations in the garden. They will grow to about 6' tall, have large very deep maroon leaves and some of them will even look more like S.S Bob than this one. They come up from seed and were growing here when we bought the house and were obviously planted by the previous owner. If anyone knows the name please let me know. Thanks."
