644223,John Bacon,2011-11-30 04:15:00,3277,The one at 401 and Morningside may be a 24 hour one; but I am not sure.
644270,Rizzo,2011-11-30 14:07:00,4754,not sure what a dremel is but were you able to find it?
644272,Roy,2011-11-30 14:12:00,13728,A little late for you now Colin but :   Canadian Wal-Mart stores begin 24-hour operations December 1 to Christmas Eve  
644299,ckrb2007,2011-11-30 15:57:00,449,"  Sorry guys..forgot to update this. We were able to do the job with a recip. saw. lol Not as neat but it did the job. I can't believe there isn't a 24hr Home Depot or Walmart in the GTA. lol Oh well.  Rizzo.....a dremel is like a dentist drill kinda. Small drill which spins at like 15,000 RPM. You can attach cutting wheels, sanding discs, buffing wheels etc.....hobbyists use them. We needed one last night to cut apart one of our fibre optic cable enclosures.......a job which was dumped on us at the last second. lol  Cheers guys!  Colin"
