644015,Curtisss,2011-11-29 18:40:00,25,"I've been lurking around these boards for a while now, and thought it was about time I said hi.  Thanks a lot to every poster for helping to get me through some slow days at work."
644022,Headhunter,2011-11-29 18:58:00,5703,Welcome aboard.... tell us a bit about yourself! HH
644025,Gerritt,2011-11-29 19:06:00,6129,"Welcome aboard Curtis! and dont mind Joe... He is a good guy once you get to know him... until he starts wearing pink gloves, cooking you dinner and serenading you with brown eyed girl... he also is a whiz at washing and drying dishes..  On second thought... be careful of Joe... he is the kid of guy you're mom warned you about when you were growing up  Welcome aboard! and yes... tell us a bit more... and we like pictures of PORN! of the fish variety.  G."
644027,Rod Caster,2011-11-29 19:09:00,5784, that's how I got started too.  Welcome to the board that won't leave you bored. Hey do I get $1 for coining that?
644039,Headhunter,2011-11-29 19:42:00,5703,I knew you secretly loved my pink gloves! HH
644041,Curtisss,2011-11-29 19:50:00,25,"Well thanks for the welcome.  Here's some stuff about me: I live in downtown Toronto (originally from a few hours further north), and don't get out fishing close to as much as I'd like. Mostly just a weekend thing for me. Next time I access the site from am actual computer I'll see about posting some pics."
644332,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-30 18:11:00,0, Deep--very deep... welcome
644334,mercman,2011-11-30 18:17:00,7054,Welcome !!! Curtisss.  Seen your name on the members on line section a few times and always wondered why the multiple S's             So why the multiple S's
644358,Gerritt,2011-11-30 21:09:00,6129,  Just to give you a reason to post asking why the multiple S's... but like you really needed a reason to post...
644361,capt bruce,2011-11-30 21:31:00,820," Wellcome aboard , you have joined a great place with alot of very great people , probably the best fishing site on the net. Like G said dont worry about Joe, we try to get him to stop hitting on all the new guys , but when you wear pick gloves , not that theres anything worng with that ... lmao ... we like fish pictures  ... hint hint ..."
644584,Curtisss,2011-12-01 16:48:00,25,"No worries at all. I'm new to these boards, but not the internet.  The S's are honestly just a lazy way of picking a username. My guess is that there's already a Curtis and a Curtiss on here."
644592,Headhunter,2011-12-01 17:12:00,5703,"   Again, welcome aboard! As you can see from the above quotes, I'm yer man if you need pink gloves!!!! HH"
644596,Curtisss,2011-12-01 17:17:00,25,"Heh, thanks.  I may take you up on that someday."
644600,Skipper D,2011-12-01 17:33:00,1970,I am another one with no reason to post ...lol.	Welcome  and enjoy your stay .
