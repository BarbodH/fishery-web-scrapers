644400,muskymike,2011-11-30 23:52:00,772," Sorry Roy, Wolf beat me to it."
644406,darsky,2011-12-01 00:06:00,586,"Roy, Lumen here in mtl stocks them as well. One location is by the old Pare Lanes (Dec/Jtalon)"
643912,Roy,2011-11-29 11:16:00,13728,"I bought a pair a few years ago and there just isn't anything to compare to them. My problem is that I was spoiled by the price that I got them for and now that I want another pair, I can't find them at a reasonable (to me) price. I've been watching Ebay and even there they're going through the roof. Does anyone have a line on where I could get a pair? I don't necessarily need the spring loaded model. If they're that rare it may be best to PM me.  Thanks gang."
643914,lew,2011-11-29 11:29:00,12766,"I seem to recall a post awhile back Roy where someone said you can now get them at Lowes, and for some reason I think it may have been GBW  Then again, I may be totally wrong"
643915,Skipper D,2011-11-29 11:32:00,1970,"They must be really rare Roy , i can't even find then in the index of the New Fisherman's Encyclopedia ........ lol ."
643916,Roy,2011-11-29 11:33:00,13728,Thanks Lew. I'll follow that up.
643917,Roy,2011-11-29 11:42:00,13728,"They're bolt cutters, Skip."
643919,Skipper D,2011-11-29 11:45:00,1970,"The Knipex company appears to still be in buiz , i'll nose around at FC Machinery later this morning and see if they can turn some thing up and let you know ."
643920,Skipper D,2011-11-29 11:52:00,1970,Which # are your's Roy ...... 71-12-200 ?

643938,darsky,2011-11-29 13:47:00,586,"Roy,if you visit Plattsburg every so often Lowes has them in the Plumbing dept"
643941,Roy,2011-11-29 13:55:00,13728,Thanks Geoff. That's what I paid for them a coupla years ago.  Thanks Darren...might be my only option.
643946,Raf,2011-11-29 14:04:00,3495,"Roy, http://theringlord.com they are in alberta.  i only see the spring loaded ones on their site but it might be worthwhile contacting them to see if they carry the others."
643964,Roy,2011-11-29 15:03:00,13728,"It's where I got the original pair, Raf. They're a good place to deal with too! I think it was Lew who gave me the heads up on the Ring Lord back then. My youngest buys a whack of stuff from them and she was able to get a little discount on top of their already fair price."
643972,Lungelarry,2011-11-29 15:33:00,294,"St. Eustache flee market....$2.oo with a chipped blade,still cuts better than any other cutter .(only saw one pair in 5 years of searching there)"
