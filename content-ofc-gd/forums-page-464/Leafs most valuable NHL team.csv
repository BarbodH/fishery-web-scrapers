644668,fishing n autograph,2011-12-01 21:46:00,2540,maybe some day they'll spend that money on a real team lol....go leafs go!
644676,GBW,2011-12-01 21:58:00,8460,"maybe if they changed the name from ""Leafs"" to ""Musky's"" more people would try and catch a game from time to time..."

I guess it makes sense to spend less on a team if they're still gonna fill up the seats, maybe if people weren't such die hard fans they'd be forced to spend more money lol. PS I don't even watch hockey"
