644654,lew,2011-12-01 21:09:00,12766,"Your not gonna believe all the good times you've got ahead of you Mike, being a dad is the best job in the world !!"
644656,Live2fish85,2011-12-01 21:13:00,1633,It only gets better from here. My daughter was starting around the same age and before you know it there walking alone.  Enjoy the times. I cant believe mines going to be 2 next week.  I can't wait to see the post of your little guy getting his first musky.
644657,davey buoy,2011-12-01 21:15:00,5505,"He's up early,lock the cabinets and close off the stairs(as if you don.t know that). I was lucky my boys didn't start walking till around a year old LOL. Lot's of fun ahead Mike ,enjoy."

644662,limeyangler,2011-12-01 21:36:00,5204,  Let the good times roll!
644663,manitoubass2,2011-12-01 21:37:00,11391,"Thats awesome MM, proud moment for sure!"
644666,Rizzo,2011-12-01 21:41:00,4754,"that's awesome! The bad news is you have to get the baby gates all over the house now, lock the cupboards etc etc etc. Our first one we were so excited to have him stand/walk...now after 4 kids my wife dreads when they get ""mobile""...so much easier when they act like a lump!"
644681,misfish,2011-12-01 22:36:00,29133,"Awesome Mike. Our Lilly is up and about aswell.7 mnths. Turn yer head and shes over there,nope,shesover there.LOL"
644683,motion,2011-12-01 22:41:00,403,"Man I miss that feeling. That's great to see at such a young age.   You'll see that they will amaze you everyday! Enjoy them while they are young, they grow up way too fast.  Cheers."
644684,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-01 22:42:00,0,Congrats and enjoy all that it has to offer--it doesn't last long. You will have a fishing buddy soon and how great is that???  Nothing like having ours boys with us   
644690,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-01 22:46:00,10439,I'd be more impressed if you said that he could cast a trico to a rising brown under overhanging willows or hit 25 straight at the trap range. But I guess standing's good too.
644751,Guest chase4chrome,2011-12-02 01:44:00,0,"Mike:  The song goes ""teach, your children well..."" There have been profound shifts in our culture, those which may have nefarious consequences to many families with boys--they ought never to have such impact however, should they, then I urge you to be forearmed. You may at some later date (hopefully never) avail yourself of: http://www.equalitycanada.com or http://sitstillandpayattention.wordpress.com/   Again, having a son share a bubble line, or deep run and watch him as the rod is almost torn from his hand with his first steelhead is as good as it gets. All the best--and teach him well..."
