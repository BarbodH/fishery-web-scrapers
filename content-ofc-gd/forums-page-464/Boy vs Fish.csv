644367,capt bruce,2011-11-30 21:42:00,820,"Solo great kid , kids that fish dont join gangs or hang on street corners , they spend all their money on fishing gear , but steelheaders maybe the crips arnt that bad , teach him to bass fish , now theres a hobbie thats worth while .. lol. Like father like son cant buy that much enjoyment to spend time with your children doing what we all love . Keep up the good work , great dads make for great children .."
644461,SGP,2011-12-01 02:59:00,23,"Memories that will last a lifetime. In fact, this brings back some of my great memories of taking my kids out fishing. Great post!!!"

644479,pikehunterjr,2011-12-01 04:34:00,16,"WOW NICE FISH!!! lucky kid, I never had any fish that big when I was his age."
644579,strakey,2011-12-01 16:20:00,78,Hey Mike I just seen that video of you and Fidel.............priceless!! Totally what I would of expected to hear from him landing a nice fish. The ones with your family are nice to see. Spread that joy some more.
644665,lookinforwalleye,2011-12-01 21:41:00,4399,What can one say Mike except priceless!!!
643397,solopaddler,2011-11-27 14:18:00,8605,"I recently brought my son and uncle out for a day of steelheading.  It was kind of neat for me as my uncle, now pushing 80 was my angling mentor as a young child.  It did my heart good to have all 3 of us in the boat together. My sons enthusiasm is contagious.

643401,Twocoda,2011-11-27 14:31:00,4130,You are a great dad !!! Thanks for sharing that ...it brought back so many memories on so many levels...i cant think of a better way to start my day then seeing these videos  losing the first fish makes the appreciation of the landing ...that much sweeter  Cheers to both of you !!
643403,danc,2011-11-27 14:44:00,4677,Just fantastic Mike. The young lad really handles that long rod very well. I predict a life long obsession.
643409,spinnerbaitking,2011-11-27 15:06:00,1622,"That's one happy fellow you have there Congrats, nice video too  SBK"
643410,mercman,2011-11-27 15:09:00,7054,That warmed my Heart Mike. So many memories for me.Thanks for making my day

643415,ketchenany,2011-11-27 15:19:00,3229,Priceless! :clapping:
643420,Beans,2011-11-27 15:34:00,3339,Big thanks for posting...  Brings back lots of memories of when my guys were young and nailed their first big fish...
643427,Pikeslayer8,2011-11-27 15:48:00,336,That was great.  Your son's unbridled enthusiasm clearly evident!  May I suggest a longer net for ole Uncle Horace. Thanks for sharing.  You are a most patient father.
643430,FinS,2011-11-27 16:03:00,463,nice going thats what its all about
643432,streamside,2011-11-27 16:12:00,12,So great to see. Can't wait to get mine off sunfish at the dock and onto the river or canoe for trout. I think we can all relate to his enthusiasm. That's why we still fish isn't it?
643439,Basskicker,2011-11-27 16:37:00,421,That's awesome Mike. Your going to have some serious competition in a few years!!!lol. We got hammered with snow here the last 2 days and the lakes are frozen!!!
643440,sirfish,2011-11-27 16:37:00,175,"Way to go Mike ,Candidate for father of the year! Love the play by play, and in th end the smile says it all.Big congrats on his first steelie,i'm sur it wont be his last...Good on yah!"
643443,solopaddler,2011-11-27 16:54:00,8605,"Thanks lads, glad you enjoyed!        Just a dad, nothing special.    He really does, kind of boggles my mind actually. You should see him cast too. For a kid who just turned 5 he's doing pretty well.     Yeah I know, a longer net would've helped for sure! It's uncle Horst btw.  He's mistakenly been called a lot of things over the years, from Horace, to Horse.    Nice to see you chime in, havn't seen you on the board in a while!    Oh man, I'm not even close to being ready for snow yet.  Enjoy yourself up there bud, it must really be an adventure!    Thanks, but most dads would do the same. I'm no different than a million others...  Wish I could get my daughter out, that's currently the big challenge for me."
643444,4x4bassin,2011-11-27 17:00:00,1025,"Those are some great videos Mike , these first impressions of the great outdoors and fishing for the young guy will last a lifetime. He is hooked forever , good job"
643445,misfish,2011-11-27 17:03:00,29133,Great time eh Mike. I was cringing when I seen the rod bend on the boat and sliding accross.   Thanks for sharing.
643448,icefisherman,2011-11-27 17:22:00,952,"Lovely videos Mike. Three generation fishing together...not much more a dad can ask for... Especially the second one...your son is a year younger than my older one and is doing very very well for his age....now I'd like to see him pulling a 20 Lbs King on Lake O. that would be even better video ha ha ha  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
643458,Victor,2011-11-27 18:03:00,1609,Loved the videos  Looks like he's already fighting fish like a pro! Must have been tough for him to use such a long rod in the boat too!
643528,SirCranksalot,2011-11-27 23:16:00,3291,Great show! Well done. My bro is in his sixties and still hasn't lost the enthusiasm---every fish is like his first one!
643582,ccmtcanada,2011-11-28 03:26:00,7971,Mike....he's turning into quite the angler!  Loved the videos...the laughter in his voice makes it all worth while doesn't it?
