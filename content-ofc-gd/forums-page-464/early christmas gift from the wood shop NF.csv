644966,Rod Caster,2011-12-02 21:53:00,5784,My parents bought a large pail of legos from a yardsale years ago and made my brother and I a little Lego station. My Mom would organize the parts for us after we destroyed the place. I spent so much time at that table and probably learned a lot of creativity and imagination because of it. Lego and dinky cars were basically my television as a child. I'm very proud that my Parents did that for us. Your Boy will have a blast at that station... and the best thing is that Lego's are interesting to kids for years... it takes a lot of time for a kid to grow out of if.  great stuff
