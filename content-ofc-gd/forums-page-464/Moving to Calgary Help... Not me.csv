643520,mikeseb,2011-11-27 22:33:00,201, Rent a U-haul and drive it out there?? That out you can hire a company to drive it out there in their own truck.
643524,Woodsman,2011-11-27 22:48:00,1286,That only pays if you have only a few possessions and a vehicle set-up to tow. Also added fuel to tow can eat up savings quickly. Other than that contact moving companies for quotes. Remember to check on their insurance (damage) policies when comparing prices. If damages are only paid by weight you could be out lots of $'s if they damage things like electronics.
643586,Uncle Buck,2011-11-28 03:57:00,1000,"Driving it out himself is not an economical option...  U-haul is too expensive with mileage...  looking at things like: train, container, 18wheeler, or something like that..."
643714,Lunker777,2011-11-28 21:13:00,866,I think you once you start to look at the cost of hiring a company. A U-Haul isnt that bad of a plan.  My sister and brother-inlaw did just that. Most economical way at the time ! They had a full house...2 kids and there own stuff.
643718,bdox,2011-11-28 21:18:00,329,A colleague just moved out there and had his stuff moved by Atlas and his car loaded on a train. He flew out via westjet

643880,Gerritt,2011-11-29 05:03:00,6129,I as considering AB for a while as my dad lives in Camrose...  A railer was around 500 one way.  G.
