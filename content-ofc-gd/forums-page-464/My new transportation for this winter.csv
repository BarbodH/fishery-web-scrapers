644531,Sharkbait22,2011-12-01 13:45:00,297,Check this out  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=568_1233111054  Interesting design.  Wonder why we don't see something similar today.  Perhaps too dangerous.
644536,Fisherman,2011-12-01 14:09:00,7201,"Bah, that's ancient news.  Now how fast does it go, not very fast. How much air can you get, none, it weighs too much, etc, etc.  So if it doesn't go fast then it's no fun, you can see the trees, the ice huts and pressure cracks from far away before they hit you."

644587,Rattletrap2,2011-12-01 17:01:00,1652,"Now, that right there, is one very cool machine! I wonder what happened to this invention? The only difficult part of this would be the pontoon screws (You listening Wayne? LOL)."
644593,cheaptackle,2011-12-01 17:12:00,849,"It's a real wonder that some form of that machine hasn't made it to the mainstream.  Considering the obvious weight and how it floated over deep snow (like none of us have EVER buried a machine!) it sure seems like quite the deal.  Sure, it may not hit a billion miles an hour like todays machines but it sure looks like it would get where you'd want it to go!  Along with whatever you may want to drag along.  I wonder where the original is today?  Michael"
644606,Fang,2011-12-01 17:44:00,1330,My son had a radio controlled toy that had the same spiral drive and layout. We used to fly that thing over the snow in the backyard and honestly I used to think wow could that be scaled up to pull my portable ice hut. Surely somebody could McGiver a lawn mower or snowblower to do something similar
644635,blaque,2011-12-01 19:45:00,2419, That part stuck out like a sore thumb to me also.
644639,blaque,2011-12-01 19:58:00,2419,My nephew actually has/had a remote control toy that is exactly this.
644777,adempsey,2011-12-02 03:13:00,1498,Cool machine!  It's like hard water version of a pontoon boat!
