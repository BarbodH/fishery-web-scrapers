644481,SlowPoke,2011-12-01 05:35:00,2984,"Call me Grinch but how many Christmas trees does a family need under one roof? My Wife recently informed me that we needed a second tree, a 'theme tree'. And now we have one. I was quite happy with our first tree's theme... CHRISTMAS!!! Now I've been informed (via her facebook status) that she wants ""at least two more trees"". I know how to put an end to the artificial forest (the lure tree) but I want to understand the need for more than one full size tree under the roof!"
644484,Kingsalmon,2011-12-01 06:10:00,107,Mine is the same.  The fake one's been up for a couple of weeks and the fresh one will come soon.  When I was a kid we were happy with one.  I can't understand why you'd want more than one either.
644494,DanD,2011-12-01 11:34:00,2223,This is all summed up in one or two statements.  HAPPY WIFE = HAPPY LIFE!  We mere mortals will really never understand and the whys will be never ending.  Dan.

644512,mike rousseau,2011-12-01 12:47:00,4661,   Even more so if the lures are new...

644516,fishing n autograph,2011-12-01 13:01:00,2540,I have a baseball tree.....but that hasn't stopped my wife
644522,bigugli,2011-12-01 13:22:00,6138,"It's called blatant consumerism. At the one garden centre I was at, Christmas brought in 4x as much retail as the greenhouse and nursery. They put up 20 different theme trees each year. Some people come in and buy a new theme tree each year to outdo the neighbour. One customer had 4 fully decorated prelit trees delivered to the house just to adorn the front lawn. In essence, the real reasons for Christmas got lost in the lights,tinsel and cash."
644528,fishing n autograph,2011-12-01 13:40:00,2540,"That's silly,the fun part is decorating the tree with the family. How busy/lazy do you have to be to buy your tree predecorated?"
644529,scugpg,2011-12-01 13:40:00,1373,2 max I hope you find keys to the starcraft under one of them bud!
644532,lew,2011-12-01 13:54:00,12766,Christmas is sposed to be fun & merry and I don't think you can have too many trees or decorations. Our home looks like a Christmas Wonderland inside and out  for the holidays and I love every minute of it.  We're having a Christmas party on the 10th for friends and neighbors and the decorations are going up this weekend.  Bring it all on
644533,SlowPoke,2011-12-01 13:54:00,2984, Not to argue your point but I should point out that she hasn't lost the meaning of Christmas; she just wants more of it!
644535,fishing n autograph,2011-12-01 14:02:00,2540,Don't encourage her lol
