643693,Roy,2011-11-28 20:44:00,13728,He seems to have lost a little weight. The fish didn't lose anything though. It was doing the rounds yesterday. A magnificent specimen indeed!
643694,Rich Clemens,2011-11-28 20:45:00,3131,I agree.  Congrats to the angler on that one.  That would put a huge smile on anyone's face.

644868,ehg,2011-12-02 15:53:00,2666,What an incredible fish from possibly best musky waters in world. Must be over 60 lbs.....
644958,COUNTRYBOY,2011-12-02 21:22:00,130,HOW MANY NICE FISH DOES IT TAKE TO KEEP THAT GUY ALIVE
644962,Pigeontroller,2011-12-02 21:49:00,2793,  What???
644968,John,2011-12-02 21:59:00,2956, Hmmmm.........trying to understand that one too Dax
644988,Remastered,2011-12-02 23:42:00,143,I think he means all the large fish the 60 inch musky probably ate to get that big.
645035,Pigeontroller,2011-12-03 02:14:00,2793,And suggesting thats somehow not right???
