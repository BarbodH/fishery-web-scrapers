644607,mercman,2011-12-01 17:52:00,7054,  Dana i have been looking at these for next year.Tried a pair on and they are very comfortable http://www.basspro.com/Bass-Pro-Shops-reg-Neoprene-Fishing-Gloves/product/73534/142605
644614,bigugli,2011-12-01 18:21:00,6138,Still out getting perchies and pike. That happens from shore til end of December.
644616,Sinker,2011-12-01 18:31:00,8692,"Its hunting season, screw fishing!  Once everything is locked in ice, I start fishing again, but from sept till then, I hardly touch a rod. Too many critters to kill  S."
644618,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-12-01 18:50:00,0,"Fall steelheading is my favourite time of year.  The fishing isn't boom and bust as much as spring so there's a slow trickle of fish into many tribs and the best part is, everybody is hunting!"
644626,manitoubass2,2011-12-01 19:06:00,11391,"I would normally still be out in a boat this time of year. Def. the best time for big walleyes.  Not this year though, just too many other things going on.  I'm still getting out on the shores though, not as much as normal but enough to keep the demons at bay, lol.  Dana/Mercman, If your looking to keep your hands warm and still be able to feel whats going on while fishing, try leather mechanic gloves. I just cut the one finger off at the knuckle for casting. Works good, there cheap, and they sell them everywhere. So there easily replaceable too!"
644629,Terry,2011-12-01 19:11:00,14456,"isn't from a boat and off shore the same thing, as you are off not on shore  just put my boat away but still could get out with people who still have their boats ready"
644633,mercman,2011-12-01 19:28:00,7054," Great idea Bud !! I was looking at black spandex to keep the rest of me warm.I figured if ski jumpers and speed skaters used spandex, it would be good for boat fishing too.    I was sorely wrong though."
644634,manitoubass2,2011-12-01 19:44:00,11391," I needed that laugh, thanks!  Seriously, hahahahaha   "
644636,adolson,2011-12-01 19:46:00,783," I saw these, or something nearly identical, at Remakko's in Sudbury, but they felt too thick for fall fishing to me. One of the sales reps told me they usually carry this other kind of glove that is exactly what I am looking for, but it was out of stock the day I was there.  These ones do look good for ice fishing though, especially on the days I plan to go (warm days!).  I could go with the cheaper ideas, I guess. But it's a bit late now - the snow's a-fallin' and there is a layer of ice this morning on the lake near my house, and sub-zero temps all up in the forecast, so... Can't be long now."
644645,mercman,2011-12-01 20:22:00,7054," Actually its warm enough, but when you are going fast in the boat, the wind causes a rippleing effect on heavy set guys like me, if you get my drift.Creates all kinds of drag."
644696,Jer,2011-12-01 22:53:00,1426,"I'm a wimp...the boat has been put away for the better part of a month now...and really didn't leave the dock much for the month before that.  I did do a lot of dock fishing in the evenings up til the 15th when the pickerel season closed. It was more of an excuse to drink beer and excersize the dog, mostly small perch, bass and the occasional catfish. Now I'm just waiting for the ice."
644716,manitoubass2,2011-12-01 23:53:00,11391,"  It made me laugh because I thought I was crazy wearing that stuff when I used to work in the oil field. -70 with the windchill, working outside for 14 hours a day, 7 days a week, and a guy will try anything to stay warm, lol.  The ol' Helly Hanson suite makes for some killer winter fishing gear these days  "
644721,mercman,2011-12-02 00:03:00,7054,"Ya, but you've seen a pic of me. Put spandex on me, and i look like Chris Farley in American Ninja"
644722,manitoubass2,2011-12-02 00:06:00,11391," oh my, your on a roll today, haha   "
644727,ecmilley,2011-12-02 00:30:00,2163,"boats gassed and ready to go, though this weekend most likely last don't like trying to winterize when it's 15 below, simcoe or quinte this weekend then the big sleep as both sleds are ready to go and keeps me entertained till march"
644729,adolson,2011-12-02 00:36:00,783," That wouldn't be so bad, if you lived IN A VAN, DOWN BY THE RIVER!!!"
644734,mercman,2011-12-02 01:00:00,7054,  Cried for a week when that man died
644757,Djeep,2011-12-02 01:59:00,199,"my boats away for a month, still getting out in others and from shore"
644807,Garnet,2011-12-02 12:41:00,2056,"Life is a BLUR. I have 9 hobby's all are fishing. They take 12 months.  Some I do twice like Spring perch and fall perch, fall Steelheading and spring steelheading unless it's warm winter then it's fall, winter and early spring, with some ice fishing in there. The boats in early for Crappie and perch, then wallys then pike,then bass then surf fishing cape cod that's new really cool with some salmon fishing.  Lifes a blur think I will going trout fishing now.  Might try competitive carp fishing just not those 56 hr things."
644811,craigdritchie,2011-12-02 13:00:00,1586,"Eh, I disagree. To me, ice is for people who haven't discovered salt water fishing down south! The fishing is far better .... the scenery is far nicer (the girls are in bikinis, not parkas) .... and ice fishing is way too much work. I mean, I'm pretty tired just making a hole big enough to fit the boat in ......."
644836,SirCranksalot,2011-12-02 14:03:00,3291,  What about talking about all winter long? Doesn't that count as a hobby? I know I've seen some pretty big fish pulled out of beer glasses!
645071,Leecher,2011-12-03 05:18:00,7832,"Nope, don't own a boat... just finished hunting season... now hibernating until safe ice Leechman"
644551,mike rousseau,2011-12-01 14:50:00,4661,just wondering how many others are still getting out...  im really curios how many boats are still getting out...  im still getting in the boat 2-3 times a week...   and if you have a date when your boat got put away or is going to be put away... id find that interesting to see when most pack it in...
644554,jimmer,2011-12-01 15:06:00,2730,"I emptied my boat out on Sunday, now it's full of snow :-( I hope to take advantage of some kind of fishing, but I think my boat is done for the year."
644555,BillM,2011-12-01 15:07:00,17367,On shore and in my pontoon.
644556,NAW,2011-12-01 15:08:00,4022,"I would still have my boat in the water, but I'm to busy with the move.  I pulled the boat out a few months early.  Usually when October rolls around, I mount the duck blind, and it doesn't come off till ice up."
644557,MJL,2011-12-01 15:08:00,2427,Steelhead for me until I can walk on water for lakers.
644558,Rizzo,2011-12-01 15:09:00,4754,"one last shot at it tomorrow, then the boat gets put away"
644561,mike rousseau,2011-12-01 15:20:00,4661,after checking the weather i should be ok to fish for the next 2 weeks at least in the boat... so 4+ trips in the boat at least...
644562,mercman,2011-12-01 15:25:00,7054,"I'm not equipped for cold weather fishing yet, so my boat has been in hibernation for 3 weeks already. If i can get some good outerwear next year, i plan on fishing till freeze up."
644564,Fish Farmer,2011-12-01 15:28:00,2234,Hoping to hit Quinte (Picton) one more time before freeze up
644568,Lungelarry,2011-12-01 15:39:00,294,Muskie time....just getting started........hope to have a post tonite
644571,Grimace,2011-12-01 15:50:00,2020,It is currently my favourite time of year to fish.  Unfortunatley due to a very demanding working schedule and a toddler at home I am waiting for ice up.  The boat is away in storage.
644574,mike rousseau,2011-12-01 16:05:00,4661, I should put a day in for musky before ice up... Haven't fished musky in a couple weeks... I've been pounding walleye... And that's addictive...
644575,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-01 16:10:00,10439,My boat's been put away for the winter 'cause we have over a foot of ice in most places.   
644577,fishnsled,2011-12-01 16:16:00,3520,"My boat is done for the year do to insurance. Will likely winterize it tonight and unpack it. However, I will be fishing from a boat this weekend."
644580,Rod Caster,2011-12-01 16:27:00,5784,Only place is the Ottawa River for me. Every thing else is either partially frozen or unsuitable for my canoe.
644582,mercman,2011-12-01 16:34:00,7054,  Sounds good to me
644583,Vanselena,2011-12-01 16:43:00,269,Still fishing Kings from the boat.
644586,mike rousseau,2011-12-01 16:58:00,4661,  Paul...this time of year me and my brother have a rule... family first...  we call each other first for fishing... if the other cant go... then friends get a call...  and this time of year we dont say no to each other very much... my normal fishing buddies are going through withdrawals lately...
644588,mercman,2011-12-01 17:02:00,7054," I know that.But a man can dream, can't he"
644589,12footspringbok,2011-12-01 17:06:00,459,Theres no option for from a boat and from shore...lol  Is it bad that I'm going to pick up some rock salt tomorrow not for my driveway but just in case the ramp is iced? LOL
644591,Squid,2011-12-01 17:08:00,1656,Still fishing and probably will fish for rainbows and lakers down at queenston and at the Niagara bar through the winter.
644598,Skipper D,2011-12-01 17:23:00,1970,"  PauL , try re'setting your status to VIP ......."
644599,adolson,2011-12-01 17:30:00,783," Same... I put the canoe in the back yard about a month ago, and I have only tried a couple times off-shore since, with no luck. My hands were freezing the last couple times so I just stopped. I want some nice thin gloves that let me feel the hits, but also block the wind, for next fall... Withdrawal is not the word - I'm fishing in my dreams, and in my daydreams! And I am only now acquiring winter gear. Put this off for too long."
644602,craigdritchie,2011-12-01 17:37:00,1586,Fish now while you can - before ice ruins everything.
644604,crappieperchhunter,2011-12-01 17:39:00,2582, Actually sounds like good planning to me
