643893,kemper,2011-11-29 06:35:00,2232,"Timing is key when you're looking for trout in the rivers - some days timing is on your side and other days it's not. Last week after a rain I headed out to the swamp of a Lake O tributary knowing that I had timing on my side. Sure enough, I walked right into a huge run of fresh chromers, and no-one in sight. I normally don't take pictures when I'm solo, but I got on a hot streak and decided to snap a couple. These were by far the easiest fish to fool that I have ever encountered, and I couldn't find a bait in my bag that they wouldn't hit.  A great day for sure, the highlight being a five drift, five steelhead on the bank streak - my best non-opener streak to date. Apologies for the muddy fish, its unavoidable in this location.                  "
643896,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-29 07:41:00,655,Nice looking chrome
643906,solopaddler,2011-11-29 10:41:00,8605,"WTG Brady, gotta love it when you hit it just right."
643958,Oggie,2011-11-29 14:37:00,588,Need the 535 on your arms after that day!  It's all in the timing just like many things in life! Dan O.
643961,kemper,2011-11-29 14:58:00,2232," Did you notice the Berkley Nanofil in the one shot... other than the fact that I almost had to sell my car to buy it, that stuff is far and away the best line I've ever used. Thanks for the tip! You barely even need to set the hook, I blew up a bunch of leads before I figured out just a quick lift of the rod will do."
643999,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-29 17:06:00,0,You never know when you step right into the middle of a free-for-all....those are good days!!
644085,rocheleauc,2011-11-29 22:03:00,205,"  Thanks for sharing/nice fish!  I've been hearing nothing, but great things about nanofil.  Definitely going to try it out soon."
644097,BillM,2011-11-29 22:52:00,17367,You catch them there fish on egg saaaacks????  
644100,misfish,2011-11-29 22:59:00,29133,Well done.  Thanks for sharing.
644108,kemper,2011-11-29 23:14:00,2232, The Ethical Committee would be proud
644115,BillM,2011-11-29 23:25:00,17367,"Dude, you gotta love those guys down there.   Up here no one says a thing (for the most part) down there I'm always making best friends 5mins after I step into the river, lol!!!"
644116,kemper,2011-11-29 23:30:00,2232, I have to agree on that one Bill. Although I did come across a guy a couple weeks ago who went on a rant about Canadians after I'd been talking to him for twenty minutes. I guess my Yankee accent is getting better...  In this case I was talking about the roe! The fish are 100% canuck
644117,BillM,2011-11-29 23:33:00,17367,Good job man!
644120,solopaddler,2011-11-29 23:47:00,8605,"  Right on man, it's pretty slick stuff for sure."
644125,misfish,2011-11-29 23:56:00,29133," There goes more money, to try something new."
644129,solopaddler,2011-11-30 00:04:00,8605,"  Gotta stay on the cutting edge Brian, or you'll be left behind in the dust."
644131,kemper,2011-11-30 00:10:00,2232,"Any idea how it might do once the temps dip below 0? The last ""best-thing"" flocast turned to dust as soon as it got cold."
644132,misfish,2011-11-30 00:10:00,29133,"  I just wished I could get out more Mike and try different things.Works going crazy again.   Just as I get back into it,they drag me back in."
644154,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-30 00:45:00,0,I don't see any Americans...thought you guys were talking about a productive outing...
644157,BillM,2011-11-30 00:58:00,17367," Yup, Nanofil rocks, been using it for a while now (I'm surprised Mike turned to the dark side, lol!!)  I find that after a while the first 6-8ft or so will start to absorb water and start to sink.  Just cut that off and you should be golden when the cold weather gets here.  I know it doesn't retain water like FC does...    I use 6lb Nanofil, it's like dental floss and casts a mile!"
644160,Guest chase4chrome,2011-11-30 01:04:00,0,"Nanofil is exemplary, has 0-memory. Used it for a while now and provides solid hook-sets."
644175,MJL,2011-11-30 01:50:00,2427,"Sweet fish Brady  With the nanofil, are you running an additional shot line below? Wouldn't mind trying it out next season."
644176,BillM,2011-11-30 01:51:00,17367,"Mike, you definitely don't want to stack shot on the Nanofil."
644232,kemper,2011-11-30 06:16:00,2232," I'm running straight 12lb nanofil to a 7.8lb redwing lead. No shot line, the Nanofil seems to be okay with me moving shot around on it so far..."
644251,rhare,2011-11-30 12:21:00,387,Some solid chrome! congrats!
