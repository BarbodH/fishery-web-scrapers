645086,Grimace,2011-12-03 11:01:00,2020,The recipe card on the right under the dish to the right of the yankee tasteless light beer reads poulet.  The dish clearly is not chicken.  You must have changed your mind before starting to prepare your food.
645088,skinny,2011-12-03 12:52:00,442,the beer is empty or the fact there is only one setting so no one to enjoy it with

645120,Beans,2011-12-03 16:15:00,3339," I'm no expert anymore but that doesn't look like a ""Coors"" in the cozy   "
645121,DRIFTER_016,2011-12-03 16:25:00,10439,  It's a Coors Light by the looks of things. I've seen the less fortunate drink them before. I however would only use them for making beer batter. Actually drinking one is beyond comprehension!!!
645124,bigugli,2011-12-03 17:18:00,6138,There's no beans or greens on the plate. Should at least be some sprouts or such with that lovely piece of venison.
645137,Skipper D,2011-12-03 18:09:00,1970,"Ok! Ok ! i got it , i got , just let me take one more stab at folks , Ok watch this  ... Ok here go's .................... ""Theres nothing wrong with the picture"" ................its perfect right ... right"
