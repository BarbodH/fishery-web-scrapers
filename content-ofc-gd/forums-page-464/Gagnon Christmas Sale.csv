644853,ah_long,2011-12-02 14:50:00,354,"these sales are really murdering my wallet  Gagnon has some good deals on the Crucial rods, but they are pretty much gone the first hour of the sale, they also have some good deal on reels, but the good ones are gone as well. I find the Loomis rods on sale a good deal, I picked up a Bronzeback spinnerbait rod for myself.  Navionics is a good deal as well, I picked up two of those  boots are good deal, but you should check out SAIL first, clothing and shoes have 20% off across the board + no tax  SAIL has no tax on everything, I picked up a HDS7 from them as the price is comparable to the lowest US price after factoring in custom taxes and duties"
