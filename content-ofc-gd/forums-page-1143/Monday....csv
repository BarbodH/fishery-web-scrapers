The water was so clear and still that the fish were spooking as soon as we entered an area. Since I could see potential hiding spots like weeds or rocks but had to stay well out from them, I put on a Rapala DT4, which stands for ""Dives to four feet."" This little bait could swim beside and over the cover without diving into it. It produced half a dozen bass, the best one was this 16.5 inch fish.    He came from the hole in the lily pads that you can see in the lower left foreground.    Back at the launch, Buck continued his quest for votes among the minnows...    Garry2R's"

117342,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-25 16:01:00,0,Great report. I guess with this heat we have been having the bass have moved back to the shallows!
117492,Garry2Rs,2007-09-25 21:43:00,1425,"Hi Brian; Yes it's the same old boat.  I did some work on the engine this year to wake up some lazy horses...grin.  Now it scoots pretty good. Hi Johnny; The water temperature hasn't changed and the shallow weeds are still healthy, so I'm finding Bass in all the regular Summer places. Garry2R's"
