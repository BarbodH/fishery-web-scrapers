I threw a lure and started to “walk-a-dog”, then from out of nowhere seagull fell down and took the walker…After landing the fish (pardon, bird) to the boat, we’ve carefully extracted hook from a leg and let her go.    Zara Spook must be a very good lure if even seagulls believe it’s wounded minnow"

117029,Musky or Specks,2007-09-24 19:54:00,2710,Ive caught a few in my life. One time behind Preston Arena on the Grand while fishing a Pop-r I caught one and while he was fighting another one came down and tried to take the lure out of its mouth and I ended up catching two at once. It made it easier getting them in but much harder getting them off without getting pecked.
