Yesterday, I got a call from the contractor who installed them.  He was complaining that the windows had been installed a whole year ago and I had not paid for them yet.  Hellloooo? Now just because I'm Fisherman doesn't mean that I am automatically stupid.  So I told him just exactly what his fast-talking sales guy had told ME last year.. namely, that in just ONE YEAR these windows would pay for themselves!  Helllooooo""? (I told him). ""It's been a year""!  There was only silence at the other end of the line, so I finally just hung up.... He hasn't called back, probably too embarrassed about forgetting the guarantee they made me.  Bet he won't underestimate a Fisherman anymore."
