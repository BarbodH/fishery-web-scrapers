Going to make it a point to stop in and see them on my way to the falls this fall. I need some of those Mega bass baits. Thanks for posting."
117049,Gerritt,2007-09-24 21:19:00,6129,New site looks good! Just a bit of tweaking and products and it is all set! will you be setting it up so people can purchase products online? or order products not normally carried?  Looking sweet though guys! Keep up the good work!...  Gerritt.

The resources needed to maintain an accurate inventory when you sell live an d online simultaneously is fairly substantive, so they are taking it one step at a time. There's still more stuff to add to the site but I wanted to wait till I have a chance to train the staff on the CMS and how it all works. Look for some new things added in the coming weeks. There's a few very small errors left intentionally that we'll correct during the training as well."
117067,Gerritt,2007-09-24 22:11:00,6129,Still looks awesome!  G.
117068,Roy,2007-09-24 22:12:00,13728,"Congrats to the folks at Fishing World. And Rick, I'm just glad you're on our side."
117226,Blake,2007-09-25 03:16:00,418,I agree with ya Roy.  We hope to be able to do online ordering in the future as Rick mentioned but we do take phone orders now for any of our products and also we will ship if required.  See you next week Rick for some training.
