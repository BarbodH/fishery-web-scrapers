117506,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-25 22:05:00,0,Great Report and nice mUsky. You have been working hard all summer and deserve that fish tbay!
116852,tbayboy,2007-09-24 03:26:00,1497,"Mikeh and I hooked up again and decided to give Scugog a go with the intention of christening his new big net with some nice slime.  We arrived at the first spot around 10am and started tossing topwaters (mike a buzzbait and me a torpedo bucktail spinning thingy ).  In no time Mike had a hit but it missed.  Shortly after a muskie 5 feet from the boat exploded on my lure and being the rookie that I am I quickly set the hook  - so quickly that I nearly impaled myself on the lure as it came flying back to me -  doh.  We had another short strike soon after but couldn't get any solid hits.  We figured this was a great sign of the way the day would go so we moved on to let those girls calm down before trying to temp them again.  Of course you can guess how this goes - 7 hours later and Mike has 1 2 lb large and I have a smallie that might hit a pound on a generous scale.  Not a wiff of muskie anywhere.  We even went back to the original action spot but nothing was going on.  At 5pm we figured we do one more hour of drifting then call it a day.  At this point I'm tossing smaller spinner baits hoping for bass or maybe a small 'ski but Mike still want the big boys and is tossing a very large chatterbait when he gets a big hit.  Finally I think and grab the net and camera when what pops up attached to the huge hooks of this muskie bait:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1253/1430073417_da3e839798_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Mikes second bass of the day"" /></a>   A couple ounce shy of  3 lbs.  Ok, well at least its a nice fish so we decide to do one more drift slightly off course for the last one.  Almost right off the bat Mike has a muskie hit the chatterbait 6 or 7 feet from the boat. Mike gets a good looking hook set in but this is one smart fish.  She throws herself in the air and bends her tail all the way around to her mouth and POP the hooks are out.  Mike simply looks at me and utters ""That was pretty cool"".  Ok fine, on goes my big topwater again as the action seems to be heating up.  10 or 15 minutes later the lure catches some weeds (the bucktail backend tends to hang low) and I give it a reef to loosen it.  BOOM thats not weeds.  Pretty quickly the  whole lake knows I'm excited about this fish.  After a few minutes of haul, run, haul, run she tires out and mike gets to slime his net:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1424/1430950588_333ff0d044_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""In the net"" /></a>   The net really worked well - made it easy to remove the hooks and get the camera and what not into place without stressing her out.  And here she is, a new personal best at 43""  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1154/1430951592_26f152de8d_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""43"" Muskie"" /></a>   And of course the release shot  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1035/1430074291_47d67468b2_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""The release"" /></a>   On the whole a very long nearly fishless day but at least it ended on a high note.  Big thanks to Mike for all the muskie pointers this summer, wouldn't have landed this guy otherwise."

116908,007,2007-09-24 12:20:00,537,Congrats on a beauty of a Musky and the PB!  007
116920,mattyk,2007-09-24 12:54:00,2110,"very nice fish, thanks for sharing!"
116933,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-24 13:38:00,698,"  LOL! After battling the weeds, wind and low water levels on Scugog on Saturday without even a nibble I tend to agree with you  Just kidding. Nice Muskie, gives me hope that there is life in the Gog!"
116940,tbayboy,2007-09-24 14:31:00,1497,I hear you guys (to angler and cliff) - I have a serious love hate relationship with Scugog.  Almost every time I'm on the lake i get skunked for the first 6 or 7 hours (usually not even a nibble) and then get a few at the end of the day (Mike tends to ok during the day but then again he knows what he's doing and I don't).  The funny thing is that when I do start hitting fish on the bog they're usually pretty nice which keeps bringing me back for more punishment the next time.  Go figure.

117207,kennyman,2007-09-25 02:38:00,737,"What a beautiful looking fish (the bass ain't bad either). Thanks for posting. Did you get her on the North,South,East or West part of the bog?"

117346,jedimaster,2007-09-25 16:13:00,3472,"Nice fish, I had a few work friends on in the boat this weekend and we landed a 42 incher on a spinner trolling. As I turned around to grab the camera it jumped off the boat so no picture. They are starting to fatten up now. Shoot me a PM we can trade a few spots to try out."
