117097,aniceguy,2007-09-24 23:56:00,1094,Mike stopped by and looked at my nasty grass he suggested nematodes.....but we didnt get into a real discussion about them.  Any experience are they ok for the dog etc..  thanks for the help
117107,solopaddler,2007-09-25 00:18:00,8605," To expand, Louis has a grub problem, doesn't want to spray chemicals (kids, dogs), so I suggested nematodes as an effective natural control."
117108,Gerritt,2007-09-25 00:21:00,6129,Mike... is Merit not the end all be all for Grubs? is it harmful to pets? I was wondering as I was considering an application on my lawn this fall and spring..  Gerritt.
117109,Whopper,2007-09-25 00:22:00,2174,"Don't think they'll hurt the dog but grass is a whole different ball game  http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ent/biocontr.../nematodes.html  Uh   and here I thought nematodes was a form of grubs.  Gerritt merit will keep them in check if you apply every year, Never seemed to effect my dog."

117121,solopaddler,2007-09-25 00:51:00,8605," Merit for your lawn? Sorry bud don't know. I said ""Louis"" had a grub problem, didn't say anything about his lawn... Louis, 2 tsps. of nematodes sprinkled on your cornflakes each morning for 7 days should take care of your problem!  "
117124,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-25 00:56:00,957,"Right JohnF, she's big.  Didn't know she had three."
117133,aniceguy,2007-09-25 01:13:00,1094,nematodes for breakfeast Mike...thats a lot of fibre and protien...remember what happens to me once some extra fibre enters the system lol  Great read I ll get teh stuff in the am and apply it.
117135,HTHM,2007-09-25 01:15:00,4082,"Nematodes are parasites that feed on grubs and other larvea. They should not be harmful to dogs or kids, in my opinion. Check out this link: http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/ent/biocontr.../nematodes.html"
