111642,Mike the Pike,2007-09-09 16:04:00,3421,Ok folks refer to the hookups thread Gerritt and I are trying to get as many people paired up for the double digits in Quinte in November .I have sent many PM's and I am waitng for some replies.Hopefully we can do it.Any help from others on the board would be appreciated. I have asked some questions in the hookups thread so hopefully we can move forward and get the boatless people on the water.As for cottages lets get them booked.  Looking forward to a successfull weekend.Now lets get updated.  Mike
117561,Dondorfish,2007-09-25 23:39:00,1000,"As mentioned in the other thread - you can add me and my buddy,Dann, to the list.  Looking forward to it!   Don"
108029,Dozer,2007-08-27 19:39:00,896,Hmmm... is this Merland Park where the big bridge is?
108037,Headhunter,2007-08-27 19:56:00,5703,"Cottage number two is now booked for Headhunter and FishnSled! Awe, such a lovely view as well! Just hope Wayne's new ride doesn't take up all of the dock space! HH"
108050,fishnsled,2007-08-27 20:09:00,3520, There's a couple of big bridges out that way but Merland Park is closer to Picton.   Click HERE for a map.
108054,fishnsled,2007-08-27 20:12:00,3520,  Good to hear HH!   Maybe Wayne can just beach that whale of a boat he has and save us little guys a dock?
108106,Mike the Pike,2007-08-27 22:22:00,3421,Is someone going to contact Wayne I know he wanted to be part of the organizing.  Now If Shawn could cancel the motel unit at merlands and rent a cottage with Gerritt and Slowpoke and maybe Roy could bunk with these guys that would be 4 so far now I know DouG and Maybe CCMT so this could be a possible 5 or 6 people.  Next step we need 8 guys to book the next cottage.Now lets get hog tied for November.
108118,Roy,2007-08-27 22:48:00,13728,"Mike, Wayne reserved his spot last November as far as I know. I'll be seeing him next week and be sure to yak to him about it."
108600,Mike the Pike,2007-08-29 12:04:00,3421,Hey Biteme you started a thread and now you have dissapeared.You can sleep on the floor this year  Leave the little Mermaid rod at home
108608,oldphart,2007-08-29 12:36:00,665,"~~~Another place to stay is at Lake On The Mountain Motel, stayed there last year, very roomy cabins, and 5min. from the ferry. Hopefully Vadordude and I can hook up"
108619,Bly,2007-08-29 13:09:00,1556,"  LOL Brian..thanks!!!  Was beginning to feel left out and unwanted ...hmm..maybe there is a reason for that LOL  Things look good for Cliff and I, he was going to start looking into booking something today...."
108627,Greencoachdog,2007-08-29 13:23:00,8163, Don't you catch big enough Wall-ices without going to the BOQ Carole? I wounder how that Wally Diver thingy would do there? I'm hopin' to get to go this year and that it's still warm enough that I can go shirtless
108629,ccmtcanada,2007-08-29 13:26:00,7971,"I'm confirmed sharing a boat with Gerritt!  Should be a blast!  Thanks Gerritt!  Bly and I will be there Friday evening/night and fishing all day Saturday and Sunday.  Never thought I'd ever say ""Come on November""...LOL."
108630,Bly,2007-08-29 13:30:00,1556,  I am wondering the same thing about that diver GCD......really hoping to get a chance to find out......oh and one can never catch enough big wall-ices!  Hoping you can make it also......be nice to see ya again..with or without the shirt! lol
108835,Tybo,2007-08-29 23:57:00,1373,"DOG, If you were from the land of ICE and SNOW. It would be warm enough."
108841,Greencoachdog,2007-08-30 00:07:00,8163, ... but I'm from the land of heat and cotton where old times are not forgotten Look Away... Look Away ...Look Away... Dixieland!!!  We grow and wear a sheetload of cotton down here eh!
108848,Clampet,2007-08-30 00:20:00,1947,"I used ta cotton to you, GCD.  "
108860,DT10Sam,2007-08-30 00:42:00,480,"Hi Everyone,  I am already down here, so I will make a showing and bring my boat out and fish with everyone as well. I am sure that you have nailed the timing perfect as the walleyes will be in the area at that time and I will be fishing alot prior to all of you arriving so I might be able to give everyone some good spots to hit.  Best regards, Sam"
108861,Gerritt,2007-08-30 00:44:00,6129,:thumbsup_anim:  :thumbsup_anim:      Sam your the greatest! I assume you will also have all the hot baits for us OFC'rs?  Gerritt.
108862,DT10Sam,2007-08-30 00:51:00,480,"I will have it all figured out by then and will be posting often. Now I need to find a way to find all of this time between the fishing and hunting to actually work the store. If it will be anything like last year I will not be putting the boat away until real late in the season.  I also have a good friend that lives down at Cressy and he usually lets me know when the walleyes are out in front of his place. He is one of the first homes on the point coming in from the lake and he always calls me when the walleyes are out in front of his place. When I will get the call is when I start to fish and follow them in.  Best regards, Sam"
108873,PERCHER,2007-08-30 01:24:00,787,Glad to here you are coming down Sam it will be nice to see you again.Blye your Walleye diver was the hot ticket last year so dont leave it at home.Cliff and Carole I was talking with Gerritt and he says you guys might need a couple floater suits to wear .Just let me know and I will bring a couple extras down for you.Dan
108901,ccmtcanada,2007-08-30 02:42:00,7971, Dan...thanks for the offer and we'll take you up on those floater suits!  Cant wait for that weekend.
108904,PERCHER,2007-08-30 02:57:00,787,Done.
108985,oldphart,2007-08-30 13:07:00,665,"~~~Vadordude and I have hooked up for that weekend, now just have to find a place to sleep, any one got room"
109044,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-08-30 14:49:00,135,"Is there any room for a ""Newbie""???  I want to join in on the fun, but I don't have a boat!  I would be willing to pay for gas or something.  What other arrangements do I need to make?  I've never done this before.  Help!"
109192,Corey,2007-08-31 00:55:00,355,"Who's got room in their boat for me? If I can get a spot in a boat, I am there."
110364,Mike the Pike,2007-09-05 02:36:00,3421,OK Peter we know you are back from vacation with I am sure no fish to report.So where are you Bud?  We want to here from you. Some cottages are booked and you have dissapeared.     MTP

107229,Terry,2007-08-24 20:46:00,14456,"I hope to go a few times, so that weekend will work as one of them"
107259,Dondorfish,2007-08-24 21:46:00,1000,Count me in as well! - And Glen - don't worry about the shirts - we'll just be heading into Indian summer by then - highs in the low 30's ( farenheit - not celcius! )   Don

107332,PERCHER,2007-08-25 00:42:00,787,I also have a couple extra float suits I can loan to those who dont have one.One is a large and the other is a small.
107366,Mike the Pike,2007-08-25 02:14:00,3421,Pete we are staying in the big cabin on the water called Mikey Bigfish .I spoke to Jenifer at Merlands and she said they are starting to get bookings for November so the sooner people book the better.Man its so far away.Yes Cliff it is early for this thread but Merlands books up fast for November so its best to book in advance.  See ya all there.MTP
107463,Corey,2007-08-25 11:04:00,355,"If somebody has room for me in their boat, I could most likely make it."
107489,Terry,2007-08-25 13:29:00,14456,ok it's just too much  first this thread about BOQ fishing this fall  then this morning infisherman..BOQ fishing  then at 930 Angler and hunter..BOQ fishing.....  now I am all pumped and ready to go....and it's way too early
107502,Gerritt,2007-08-25 15:11:00,6129,I am interested.... where do we stay? and how do I book it? anyone have any room in something already booked? Also would my new boat handle Quinte at that time of year?  Gerritt.
107507,Fish Farmer,2007-08-25 16:07:00,2234,"I'll leave you some fish  . Myself and about 10 other buds are staying Picton Harbour Inn, Nov.14,15,16. Fishin Eastern Gap  ."
107508,PERCHER,2007-08-25 16:10:00,787,Gerritt we are staying at Merland Park but we already have 8 in our cottage wich is the max they say.If we had room you would be more than welcome.Maybe we should start something on the hookups so guys that want to come and maybe want to share accomadations or have room in there boat for someone.Last year there was lots of people fishing solo on the water.I say lets fill all the cottages with OFNERS and fill all the boats this year.There is a few Hotels close by.I dont Know if the Picton Harbour Inn and the Tip of THe Bay are still open.But there is the Sportsman Motel just down the road and its only a 5 minute drive to the boat ramp at the ferry.As far as your boat goes Gerritt you will have no problems.Dan
107509,Toronto_Angler,2007-08-25 16:12:00,698,"I'm hoping to get out to Merland in the last weekend of October, I'll let you guys know how the fishing is. I've never been there but from some of the things I've read about it here I've been convinced to go"
107510,PERCHER,2007-08-25 16:13:00,787,So there ypu go the Picton Harbour inn is still open and they have a ramp and docks as well.
107511,Gerritt,2007-08-25 16:13:00,6129,great idea percher! as I am solo in my boat @ this point.
107518,Mike the Pike,2007-08-25 16:34:00,3421, Hey Geritt Cliff needs a partner.And you need 4 rod holders once you cross the Adolphus reach ferry a fisherman is aloud 2 rods each I hope your coming with the new boat.  Mike
107522,Gerritt,2007-08-25 16:43:00,6129,I would be honoured to have Cliff in my boat! Rod Holders eh? I'll look into em!  Gerritt.
107523,Roy,2007-08-25 16:46:00,13728,I think I only have room for one but anyone is welcome.
107529,fishindevil,2007-08-25 17:06:00,6254,"Well last year i had to stay at the sportsman down the raod and i made 3 trips to merland park,cause i was fishing solo and was looking for anyone who was without a spot in a boat....well there was alot of people staying all over the place and nobody ended up fishing with me as everyone was scattered...we all needed a meeting time so we can all organize....i sure hope we can do that this year..."
107531,SlowPoke,2007-08-25 17:14:00,2984,Dibs on Carol! LOL
107532,Mike the Pike,2007-08-25 17:15:00,3421,Hey Shawn with a little organization I think we can coordinate the whole weekend better this time.We have time on our side this year.
107533,Mike the Pike,2007-08-25 17:16:00,3421, Hell just take Roy's boat he didn't get out once last year
107538,fishindevil,2007-08-25 17:44:00,6254,"Well i just got off the phone with jennifer lavers i AM BOOKED IN FOR SURE NOV 16,17.     its gonna be fun i cant wait seeing how i didnt make lakair this year,but i love quinte,and i hope to get down there a few times prior to that weekend....that will prob be my last trip of the year,so im really looking forward to it....bring on them big walleyes....."
