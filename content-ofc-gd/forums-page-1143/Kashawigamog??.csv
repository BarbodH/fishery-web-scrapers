116668,Pigeontroller,2007-09-23 16:43:00,2793,I've thought about fishing it myself...It definately has some deep water and Lake Trout...Seems like a recipe for some Fat Girls! I have a map in the Haliburton fishing guide book you can get just about anywhere. I imagine there would be a public launch in Haliburton.
116676,Musky or Specks,2007-09-23 17:10:00,2710,"Public lauch in Haliburton, which is actually Head Lake(tons of fish under 36"" in Head) Go south under bridge into Grass and Kash is South of that. Yes there is deep water forage but the fish are still Kawartha strain and dont put the girth on that Great Lakes strain Musky do."
116781,singingdog,2007-09-24 00:02:00,1047,"It's generally slow for lakers and Musky - there are definity better lakes in the area for lakers. It does give up a few good musky every fall, but no better than Grass or Head lake. There are several good shoals for pickerel and the bass fishing is quite good. If you get up this way, the tackle shops in Minden and Haliburton have depth maps, but 2 of the best shoals don't show up on them."
116832,Skud,2007-09-24 02:16:00,739,What's wrong Mike? Balsam getting to slow for you?
116943,musky66,2007-09-24 14:37:00,273,"Whats this? A lurker pops his head up! Hello Skud, I haven't seen a post from you in a while! I haven't made it out much this year- too much work. But yes, Balsam has been a little slow. Have nailed a couple more tigers this fall- but no real size to them...yet. Just looking at broadening my horizons. Finally got a nice 'ski from Georgian bay- a four year quest. A fat 45"" sweetheart! Hope everything is well with you and yours."
