I have always loved his work.  R.I.P. Ken  Sep 24, 2007 12:39 PM THE CANADIAN PRESS  GUELPH â€“ Renowned Canadian painter Ken Danby has died at the age of 67. Greg McKee, the manager of the Danby Studio in Guelph, Ont., said Danby died Sunday while canoeing in Algonquin Park. McKee said it's believed Danby died of a heart attack, but the cause of death will not be known until an autopsy is completed. Danby, born March 6, 1940, in Sault Ste. Marie, is recognized as one of the world's foremost realist painters. He's best known for his 1972 painting ""At the Crease,"" depicting a masked hockey goaltender. He is survived by his wife and three sons. In the 1980s, Danby prepared a series of watercolours of Canadian athletes at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. He has also served on the governing board of the Canada Council and as a member of the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery of Canada.  In 2001, he was vested in both the Order of Ontario and the Order of Canada."
