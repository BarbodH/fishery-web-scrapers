The pike measured 44 inches; weight about 16lbs. approx.   No visable injuries or marks on the fish. Question is;Has anyone caught a pike in Twelve Mile Lake before? I have fished the lake many years .   It has been mainly a lake trout and smallie lake. Came as a surprise to me how it got into the lake in the first place.

While I was there the odd small musky was caught, usually in adjoining Boshkung Lake coming from the Maple-Grass chain through the Beech river.  A couple years after we left there was an article in the local news about a large pike caught in Little Boshkunng.  I also heard that there are some pike in Kushog Lk that also runs into Boshkung."
