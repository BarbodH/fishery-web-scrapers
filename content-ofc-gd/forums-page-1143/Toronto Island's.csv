Should I head to Ward's Island or stick to the main centre island? I've never fished down their before, I was thinking of just walking around looking for some boat docks and throwing some mepps or some spinner baits to see if I can pull out any bucketmouths or maybe even a pike. All tips are appreciated I'll have my report wednesday with some pics of my catch (Hopefully)"

117017,mikeymikey,2007-09-24 19:25:00,376,you should fish from one point to the other. fish it all
117140,HTHM,2007-09-25 01:26:00,4082,"Try the lakeshore at hanlans point, I sure you will get LOT'S of nibbles , but maybe not the kind you want. Actually there is a pond that is north east of the ""tee hee"" beach that I have see some large trout swimming in. Might be worth a shot."
117197,007,2007-09-25 02:30:00,537,Mikeymikey's got it right - fish it all.  Just pick a ferry and start walking.  Look for all the likely places to find bass and you will find some eventually.  Problem I find is that they are not always in the same place from day to day. So just because I caught one in one place doesn't mean I will catch one in the same spot the next day. Its best to walk around trying lots of different places.  Try to find weeds - preferably green ones not dead ones in about 4-8ft of water plus try docks and along harbour walls.  If you know where to look you can often see the fish before you even cast a line.  Good luck.  Look forward to your report and leave some for me to catch this weekend!  007
117200,Rizzo,2007-09-25 02:33:00,4754," yipes if I know what you're referring to.  My suggestion is stay the heck away from that beach, I stumbled upon it as a teen in the 1980's, my eyesight still hasn't fully come back.  Tried to see if there were any girls around, but nope, not a one."
117222,mepps,2007-09-25 03:10:00,1301,center island for sure!
117229,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-25 03:27:00,698,Thanks Guys. If I don't get skunked I'll have a full report for ya
