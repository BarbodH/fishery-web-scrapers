This plan was a long time in the making and was a direct result of heavy fishing pressure at Valens that could no longer be sustained. I look forward to the revival of the fish stocks here and appriciate all of the input from concerned anglers abroad.  Gordon R. Costie Superintendent Valens Conservation Area 905-525-2183 519-621-6029  Valens Fishery Management Plan September 19, 2007  Valens Conservation Area will close its winter fishing season beginning December 1. This will mean ice fishing will no longer be permitted, with the exception of a catch-and-release ice fishing derby to be held in February 2008. The fishery will open for summer anglers from the last Saturday in June until the last Saturday in November.  Valens has been designated a Provincial Fish Sanctuary in the spring for more than 30 years. In 2008, this status will be removed. However, to continue to protect breeding pike and bass, the reservoir will remain closed for fishing in the spring. The spring closure also allows panfish a chance to repopulate. Panfish are not only important on their own as game fish to anglers, but a viable panfish population is important to the ecology of the lake and the success of the bass and pike populations.  Fishing in the Valens Lake has always been a strong attraction for visitors. The fishery has consisted of a summer fishery for bass, pike and panfish from the end of June until the end of November and ice fishing for pike and panfish from December 1 to March 31 (as ice conditions allowed). Ice fishing grew in popularity very quickly at Valens since it began in 2000. Initially anglers had tremendous success, but staff noticed a quick decline in the abundance and size of fish being caught during the winter. For example, during last yearâ€™s ice fishing derby a total of just more than 100 Bluegill were caught by more than 100 anglers. In previous years this could have been the number caught by just one angler in a day.  The closure of the winter and spring fishing seasons at Valens will help to relieve fishing pressures on the fish community and to allow the reservoir to maintain a self-sustaining fishery. The status of the fish stocks will be measured as time passes to determine three things: how and when the winter fishery can be reopened; whether the spring fishery can be opened; and the success of the catch and release program. HCA staff expect that with a reduction of the fishing pressure, fish populations in the lake should be able to rebound in a short time. HCA will also educate and encourage anglers to practice catch and release fishing during the open season. Future Voluntary Trial Harvest Limits will also be posted for the different fish species to ensure healthy fish stocks."
116884,Roy,2007-09-24 11:09:00,13728,Good on them for being proactive. I guess the only downside to that is for the people who live close by and don't have too many options to take their kids ice fishing?
116885,Greencoachdog,2007-09-24 11:16:00,8163,Doesn't bother me in the least!
116889,joonmoon,2007-09-24 11:27:00,528,It's a good thing and as far as places to take the kids ice fishing...there are plenty of conservation areas to go to within 1 hrs drive. I hope this works for the park cause next step is to ban fishing there and keep it as a waterfowl sanctuary.
116914,pikehunter,2007-09-24 12:45:00,1659,"Good job!  I think they should go one step further and close the lake down for fishing altogether for at least one season and continue with the ice fishing ban. Maybe then reopen for a couple of seasons for kids camping under 18 of age before re-opening for the regular summer season.    I took my son there a couple of years ago. We never had a bight however, there was a boat with mesh bags hanging off the side full of bluegills and crappies, most were so tiny that they could have passed for aquarium fish. Just an indicator of total greed."
116967,Rich,2007-09-24 16:10:00,3927,Excellent idea. I couldn't believe they opened that place up for ice fishing in the first place and I also noticed the decline of panfish since then. Hopefully stocks go back up!
