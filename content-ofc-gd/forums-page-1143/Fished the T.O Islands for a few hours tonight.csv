116840,007,2007-09-24 02:49:00,537,"Hi there folks.  With such great weather this weekend I decided that I had to try and fit a few hours fishing in down at the Toronto Islands.  Headed down there about 4pm this afternoon and fished till dusk.  Started out by float fishing worms around weeds, but most of these were going brown, so wasn’t too hopeful of getting many bites.  After half an hour and one small perch I moved on and tried next to some floating weed near some docks and sure enough I could see some large dark shapes taking a look at the bait.  Second cast – bam – fish on.  As I reeled this huge bucketmouth out from the cover I noticed two other large ones follow it!  After quite a fight including about three jumps and a couple of powerful runs into the weed I had netted my new PB Largemouth Bass – all 20 inches and 4lbs 13oz of it!    Beat my old PB set a few weeks ago by only 2oz!  Still waiting for one to top 5lbs.    After all that commotion I didn’t hold out much hope of the other bass still being around but I tried anyway.  I switched to soft plastics but had no takers.  I then tried xraps and mepps for a while to see if any of the resident pike were around but only had follows from small bass and perch.  I switched back to the worm and fished a little deeper and hooked into a 1 1/2 lb Bullhead.  Hadn't hooked one of these for a while.    I decided to move on a little further and try again.  Third cast – fish on – another big feisty largie safely in the net.  This time the scales read 3lb 4oz.  I continued with a float and worm – why change a winning formula – and had a fish attack the bait at the surface as I retrieved it.  I assumed it was another bass so cast again – reeled it in and splash a fish takes it off the top.  Not a bass but a little snot rocket of a Pike.  Though I have hooked into bigger Pike this year, technically this was the first one I had actually landed (so definitely off my list now LOL).      I noticed a few carp swim by, so I tossed in a few handfuls of corn and baited my hook in readiness.  One carp of maybe 20lbs stopped and showed interest but got spooked and swam off.  Time to go home.  Here’s a few shots at dusk.  Cheers 007    "

Who says ya need a boat to catch big buckets  So you have gone galavanting all over Ontario's northern parks, only to get your PB bass in downtown Toronto, that is kinda funny.  Good to see you getting into some nice fish!  Good luck in your quest for one over 5lbs.  Aaron"
