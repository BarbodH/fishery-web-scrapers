Since I hadn't used my musky rod since Lakair, I decided to take that. Tossed on a new deep diving Rapala Slash bait (4"" perch) and within half an hour caught a ..... musky. I wonder it thats all you have to do? Tomorrow I'll bring my Tarpon rod to test the theory. No pics since the fish was smaller ( 30"" or so) and  and I had cut ALL the trebles off. 4"" lure + musky= new damm hooks. I knew it was an esox right away ( he hit right at the edge of the pier) but couldn't figure out why this pike was jumping all over. Also explains why the walleyes were AWOL."

Glad to hear that you got out and even if you didn't catch what you wanted, you caught a nice fish.  Oh and if no one else on our team catches a musky....you are in big trouble for not taking a picture  LOL"

117228,Aaron Shirley,2007-09-25 03:23:00,655,That's too funny Rick.  Nice job on the muskie.  Maybe I should buy a shark rod and go fish Bronte lol.  Aaron
