117096,Canuck2fan,2007-09-24 23:52:00,1444,"Unless the 08 regs change things it has always been ""legal"" to use minnows from different bodies of water in an area.... There was a temporary bait movement ban early this year but it only affected commercial sales, my understanding as I read it the individual angler could still catch bait on one lake and take them to another. Although it would have been immoral in my opinion. What is frowned upon is dumping the left over minnows into the different body of water. What I don't understand is you shouldn't dump the water in the new lake either but you sure see a lot of folks using a trolling bucket or keeping their minnow fresh by leaving them in the water at the new lake.... Which seems to be just as dangerous to me.  As for salted minnows working.... I have seen days where they outfished live minnows 2 to 1 for perch."

117242,graftongal,2007-09-25 10:24:00,145,I know someone who eats them once he buys them!  Where the hell is Cory when you need him...
117245,mcallister.grant,2007-09-25 10:42:00,327,It may be a given; but dead minnows work fine for me in moving water.

117249,Roy,2007-09-25 11:22:00,13728,Dead minnows is not the proper term. Deceased folks are called corpses. Dead animals are carcasses. Dead minnows are appetizers.
