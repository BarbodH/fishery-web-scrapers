I've never taken the Green Party seriously until this year simply because as John Tory is quoted as saying ""They add a one dimensional view to the debate"".  Until you dig, the media won't provide you with any other view so I dug and found out these folks are serious contenders who have a much bigger platform than just environment. As hunters and anglers we know that environment does however have a large role to play in our sport.  The following quote is an email conversation between Melanie Mullen (Green Party Candidate Niagara Falls) and myself on behalf of many sporting interest communities throughout Niagara. "
116855,chilli,2007-09-24 03:49:00,199,Wow no one in Ontario interested in commenting on the fate of the fish and wildlife program. The people who cut it in the first place promising to fund it and the promise breakers not ready to help and someone new who's never had the chance to break a promise says they're willing to do better and nobody's got anything to say about it?  Is anyone going to vote from this board come the tenth?
116879,bowshep,2007-09-24 10:40:00,378,Don't be jumping to conclutions l have been voteing green for over 20 yrs. Before it was just to show protest for the other partie's but now that they have a viable platform its no longer a protest vote. Peace Ken
