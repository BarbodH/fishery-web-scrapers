117043,highdrifter,2007-09-24 21:03:00,2534,"Very kewl!  I have a question though.  Would love to have the canoe here myself so I could access the outside of the mud line.  Do I need lights on a canoe? Or can I get away with just a head light.  I fish just on the outside of the Toronto Harbour, so do I still need mount lights??  Love the chinis when they're still in the lake.  I've stopped going to the rivers this time of years because I'm afraid what scene awaits me when I reach the water..  You've given me some inspiration though!!  cheers! HD"
117051,lazybum,2007-09-24 21:20:00,142, I first need some lights and method of propulsion before I go out there with my canoe.  I got the battery charger on my cross-border shopping trip but no trolling motor and battery yet.  The current out of your normal trib is ferocious and scary near the point we were fishing.  Further out should be OK.  And of course you get Cleos zinging over your head out there.  It's frightening to think that a big salmon can drag you out into the big lake to Rochester if you motor goes silent.
117059,ccmtcanada,2007-09-24 21:46:00,7971," Yes...you do need lights.  We bought the 2 colour bow light and a stern light that sits up about 18"".  You can get both at Canadian Tire....battery operated.    I did make a home made stabilizing bar....pictured here....It goes off one side and is very stable. I can stand up in the canoe without any problems at all!!!  I debated on putting one on either side, but decided against it because I wanted one full side open to land the fish.     LOL lazybum...I do have a trolling motor for mine. I figure since it's a 30lb thrust motor and I'm using 20 pound line, I shouldn't have to worry about been towed to Rochester...haha."
117063,Tarzan's Jane,2007-09-24 21:58:00,1183,So it is possible to land a big one in a canoe!  Ken and I fished from the canoe and he was able to get 3 but they were small and I was thankful for that cuz I sure wasn't ready for the big ones.  I do love the stabilizer - great idea.  Congrats and once again I am learning much from you - great report.
117199,Mike the Pike,2007-09-25 02:33:00,3421,Wow nice fish Cliff.One question was the anchor down or up when the salmon started pulling.Nothing like having your own vessel when the crowds get too thick.Oh Carole nice job with the net  MTP
117234,frozen-fire,2007-09-25 03:55:00,542,you are the salmon master!

117502,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-25 22:01:00,0,Salmon from a canoe!! What a rush that must have been!
116578,ccmtcanada,2007-09-23 05:10:00,7971,"Well, I believe the last report was about Bly's first ever shore Salmon. We went out a few more times over the week and here are the results.  With the piers and mouths of tribs so crowded these days, we decided to try a few different tactics. After our success on the tribs with Bly's Salmon, we tried again, and this time I hooked up with a nice Chinook....weighing in at 19 pounds and measuring 37.5 inches!! This one put up an awesome fight...took about 15 minutes to bring in.   The release....   We went out one other time and got skunked....went 0 for 2 in that time. Finally, we changed venues and headed out in our canoe....looking to hook up with our first big fish in it! It didn't take long...about 20 minutes into casting and retrieving, this very well fed male smashed my lure! It hit very close to the canoe and shot straight under it. ACK!!! Had to somehow manouvre myself around to face the other direction while fighting this fish without tipping the canoe...LOL. After about 10 minutes, with Bly ready with the net, he finally came into the boat.  This one wasn't as long as my other one, coming in at 34 inches, but it weighed the same....had some pretty good girth.  Anyhow, that was our rest of the week summary...hope you enjoyed!"
116580,fatherof3,2007-09-23 05:12:00,1769,"was wondering where your reports went,couple nice fish there.Must have been fun in the canoe,congrats"
116584,snag,2007-09-23 05:52:00,1932,"Congrats,  Now go to bed!"
116588,SlowPoke,2007-09-23 07:50:00,2984,"Hmmmm, someone removed thier ""I'm a walleye fisherman"" signature! Salmon in the canoe eh? Are you thinking of manual or electric downriggers for next summer? Two great fish and congrats on your personal best(s) -Brian"
116598,canadian_copper,2007-09-23 11:37:00,925,GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS GETTIN GOOD FISHIN TIME IN LATELY!!
116609,mattyk,2007-09-23 12:22:00,2110,sounds like a fun adventure in the canoe. Nice fish.
116613,smokinall4s,2007-09-23 12:40:00,89,"Those are two sweet looking Salmons there Cliff. Man you got the touch for night fishing, wish I did. Any how, congrats on landing a first in the canoe. Keep up the great reports."
116632,ccmtcanada,2007-09-23 13:27:00,7971," LOL Brian...I chose that back when Walleye was all I caught.  I really do try to connect with the fish...imagining the line as my communications conduit.  I talk to the fish I'm trying to catch (if you dont believe me, ask bly...LOL), so I figured since I seem to understand how they are feeling, I now consider myself a fish whisperer."
116633,JohnF,2007-09-23 13:30:00,3494, Jeez. I'da probably rolled the canoe just lifting that leviathan in. WTG.  JF
116687,ecxstriper,2007-09-23 18:42:00,343,Way to go Cliff those are some nice fish and Becky calls you the salmon whisper
116698,steve_paul,2007-09-23 19:45:00,658, Nice job fish whisperer  Congrats Cliff.
116703,Joey,2007-09-23 19:54:00,9122,Great report Cliff.  I was away for the week so a combined weekly report works for me  Getting some great Salmon action in this year eh!  Great stuff.  Joey
116714,Deano,2007-09-23 20:16:00,767,"Salmon in a canoe, that's called water skying. Great going Cliff. You must be sweet talking those salmon. LOL"
116721,mikeymikey,2007-09-23 20:33:00,376,All I want to know is... Was the salmon able to pull your canoe?
116725,ccmtcanada,2007-09-23 20:45:00,7971," It did pull us a little bit...definitely turned us as it tried to swim under the boat, but we weren't being towed around."
116739,Greencoachdog,2007-09-23 21:38:00,8163,Great report and pics Cliff!!!... but what I want to know is what's wrong with Carole? Is she sick or something? She's usually beatin' yer eyes out with the fishin'. Keep on doin' whatever you're doin' because I've got a feeling she's gonna play catch up one of these days soon and it aint gonna be pretty for ya!
116758,fishindevil,2007-09-23 23:05:00,6254,Nice fish bud !!!!!!   congrats on your new PB...cheers
116844,tbayboy,2007-09-24 03:00:00,1497,"Wow, surprised that fish didn't drag your canoe all the way to the spawn.  Congrats on your new PB."
116846,007,2007-09-24 03:09:00,537,Congratulations on some great fish - Salmon fishing from a canoe - now that sounds like one hell of a ride!  007
116860,danw,2007-09-24 04:44:00,72,"Congrats on your pb, the keep on getting bigger and bigger. Good job boating such a huge fish. I can only imagine."
116922,ccmtcanada,2007-09-24 12:59:00,7971," Oh yes....she'll catch up....and big time!  This always happens....she'll kick my butt for a few weeks, then the tables turn..."
116925,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-24 13:10:00,698,"Congrats CCMT, you seem to have the touch for Salmon.  Kills my confidence though as I get skunked night after night throwing spoons"
116997,Kirk,2007-09-24 18:17:00,347,"Awesome fish...more awesome in a canoe, nice balancing practice"
117009,MJL,2007-09-24 19:04:00,2427,Great report Cliff.  Congrats on getting them from the canoe...Salmon fishing from a canoe is something I've always wanted to try with my own.  Hopefully my dad is game for trying something like that.
117033,discophish,2007-09-24 20:41:00,392,"Awesome job again!  You are going to need a set of pontoons to stabilize that canoe if you are catching fish like that, and float bags to keep you above the water line!  Congrats!  I love fishing from the canoe.  Very natural experience."
