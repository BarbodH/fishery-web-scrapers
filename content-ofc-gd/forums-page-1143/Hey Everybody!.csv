116843,Parisite,2007-09-24 02:59:00,66,Hey Everybody!  New to the board but I must admit I've been lurking the threads for the past couple of weeks.  There's a lot of new info posted here every day that's been quite helpful.  It's good to see such an active membership!!  I have recently renewed my interest in fishing and I have to say...my wife hates it!  She'll get used to it.  I live about 3 minutes from the Grand River in Paris (Hence the Screen name - Paris-ite) and have enjoyed fatherof3's posts.  Every time I pass over the High Bridge in town I look down below to see if I can find him and his kids casting a line.  I've had some pretty decent luck on the river lately but it's all been from land.  I'm heading to Bass Pro Shops tomorrow to pick up some waders.  Hopefully that'll get me a little closer to some of those sweet spots that just can't be reached from land!  It's good being here and I'll check in soon.
