We’ve managed to land five pikes of this average size.    Now few words about live entertainment  My friend hooked pike of decent size 28-30” and all hell broke loose, three or four jumps from the water, then in to the weeds. After couple min it surfaced about 8’ from the boat. I put landing net in the water to scoop him, but the pike got different idea  . Decided to charge the boat, hit it almost in the middle and …….. unhooked itself.  About half hr later my friend casted spoon. Water was like gin clear. We see pike of decent size following the spoon ( about 1” behind). 2’ from the boat went back in to the weeds. I’ve tossed xrap in this direction and the scenario repeats itself. In mean time my friend put spinnerbite on the line and everything repeats itself again.  No commitment at all ,total lack of confidence, plainly stupid   (I’m talking about pike )  . On the other hand I’m thinking that this fish in this particular lake to grow to this size (about 30”), must be pretty smart ( not like the next case ). We are going to play this game next weekend again.  Again about half hr later my friend hooked perfect fish fry contestant   ( about 25”). I’ve put it in the net. Pike was lying on the side, with pliers I’ve removed the treble and was ready to put it in the basket when I’ve noticed something strange. My friend was casting same spoon again and the pike has another spoon dangling from the mouth on the other side of the head   (somebody lost this piece of hardware). Point were embedded the way it could open the mouth for about an inch and still managed to grab another spoon. This kind of desperation deserve another chance. We’ve released it to gain some weight ( I do not know how long this pike was on a diet). Bottom line, another good day on the water"
