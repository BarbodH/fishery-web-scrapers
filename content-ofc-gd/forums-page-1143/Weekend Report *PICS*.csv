Friday  Kelli and I headed out to Cooch to try some smallies.  Figured the limestones would be on... wrong.  But about a km north of the stones they sure were, a few boats out there, even some largies.           Saturday  Cal and I braved the winds to fish the north end of Simcoe.  We chose the north end to stay out of the wind, I dont usually like that area, but the dang roughest ride of my life from Barrie to almost Orillia was certainly worth while.  We dragged tubes and dropshotted in 18-30 feet for pig smallies.  Even got a tagged fish.    Sunday  Had a tournament on Gloucester Pool.  Our goal was to get a limit of smallies, then look for a big largemouth.  We did what we wanted and weighed 14 pounds.  Good e nough for 5th place!  "
