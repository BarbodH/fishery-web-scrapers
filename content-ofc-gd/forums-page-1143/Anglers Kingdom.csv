117057,BryonG,2007-09-24 21:43:00,52,Well< I just got back from a week at Anglers Kingdom and it was everthing that I had hoped it would be.I'll load some pictures as soon as I can fogure out how. Weather included everything from snow and wind to movement stopping fog to 70 degree cloudless glass flat days. Typical Canadian weather. 6 of us caught roughly 1000 walleyes with 80 or so between 23 and 28 inches.We caught in the neighborhood of 100 pike with a bunch in the mid 30's and largest a fat 41 in. The people were very nice and accomodating and the lake is magnificent. Great acomadations for a remote camp.I'll try to get some more details for you when time permits.
