116659,danc,2007-09-23 15:58:00,4677,Wow Joey. That looks like an awesome time. Fantastic photos!!
116667,Joey,2007-09-23 16:42:00,9122,"Yes Cliff, It took me about an hour and a half to do the report, but I know how much OFC'rs like their pics  I'll go through the rest of the pics I didn't post and put them in the photo section when I get a chance this week.  Grog, we went looking for you on Wednesday, but I guess you had already left.  We weren't sure what resort you were on as most of them didn't have names on them, but kept a look out for you all week.  I'd like to see your report.  Johnny Bass, I was going to hold the pike by the gills but it was having none of that.  The old cross our heart pike hold works every time     Right Roy  Thanks again all.  Joey"

116788,dustink,2007-09-24 00:27:00,526,"Some amazing pics....great seeing those trees change.  What a pretty site!  Some great colors on some of those pike as well....  Thanks for sharing, and glad you had a good time!  dk"
116924,Smokey,2007-09-24 13:01:00,1278,Thanks for the report Joey. It's tough lake to fish when your new but once you have it figured out there is some great fishing to be had. Elephant Lake has some great fishing as well and is a bit easier to figure out.  Thanks for all the great pics.

116993,Headhunter,2007-09-24 17:43:00,5703,Great scenery shots Joey... um... except the one's with Tybo in them!LOL Looks like God's country to me! Well done. HH
116994,tbayboy,2007-09-24 17:55:00,1497,"Great report Joey, some fantastic pictures in there.  The before and after tree shots are amazing - hard to believe they change that fast."
116998,Bitsmith2k,2007-09-24 18:22:00,396," thanks for the great report! after a few trips of hating that lake, the last couple summers it's become a favourite of mine.."
117038,discophish,2007-09-24 20:56:00,392,"Great report!  The pictures you have taken captures all the words to describe your vacation, and some nice fish to talk about.  Sorry about the pickerel.  I had the same problem with them on my recent 2 week vacation.  You are right about that lake, I'm surprised I still have my butt attached to my body after zipping over all that lumber.  Good to hear that you saved your prop, and everything attached.  Hope the run into Jack Sparrow was a friendly one."
117041,Moosebunk,2007-09-24 21:01:00,3970,"Wilson. hehehehe.  Great shots, nice smallies and pike too."
117053,steve_paul,2007-09-24 21:26:00,658,"Great report Joey, some amazing shots there.  Glad you guys had a good week, thanks for the report."
117069,Tarzan's Jane,2007-09-24 22:18:00,1183,"Great report and some very nice pics.  I actually thought of you while we were out in the rain - thankfully though it was just for one day.  We did have mist on the water, and one morning it was a very cool 2 degrees and I did not care to get out of my sleeping bag.  I was contemplating how I could steal more heat from Ken.  lol Holidays go by so quickly - glad to hear that you had great weather and a relaxing time."
117072,lunkerbasshunter,2007-09-24 22:23:00,2585,awesome report!  Love that boathouse that looks liek a boat.  How cool was that!  Cheers!
117073,Joey,2007-09-24 22:24:00,9122," Oh, finally somebody caught that, I was beginning to wonder if everyone thought I was nuts  Thanks Moosebunk  Joey"
117183,Mike the Pike,2007-09-25 02:08:00,3421,Now Joey where did you learn how to hold Pike like that.   Nice report and pictures Joey.I see the new Canon is working very well.  MTP
117355,Spiel,2007-09-25 16:32:00,9065,"....Very nice Joey. Can't imagine anything more special that watching fall come to northern Ontario whilst away on holidays.. Fall, my favourite time of year."
117362,fishnsled,2007-09-25 16:44:00,3520,Great report Joey!  I haven't been on that lake for a few years now and seeing your report has got me making plans to get back asap.
117579,Baptiste,2007-09-26 00:50:00,37,"Great report and beautiful pics. I know this lake and how tempermental she can be. The water is always low at this time of year and this year is lower than usual. If anybody is interested, we have a websight...baptistelake.org...lots of useful info. If you check the photos you'll see a musky that choked on a walleye. Oh yeah, by the way... we are fished out...there are no more fish here, if you want to actually catch fish you should try some other lake... but not Elephant or Benoirs"
116534,Joey,2007-09-23 01:57:00,9122,"Paul and I got back from a week at Baptiste Lake this afternoon.  It was a wonderful week of holidays and we had fun discovering a new lake.  This lake is the weirdest lake we have ever encountered.  It is very deep in some spots and very shallow in others.  There are also many, many stumps and sunken logs, which made trolling difficult at times and learning the lake a must before any speed was possible.  I'm actually surprised we made it the whole week without hitting a stump just below surface.  Each day we'd have near misses and say ""I can't believe we didn't hit a stump today"" to which we'd reply ""day ain't over yet!""  But we were careful and cautious and made out well in that department.  We'd be trolling in 15 - 20 fow, which would quickly change to 35 - 45 fow, then immediately to 6 - 8 fow, very weird.  We rented a nice 4 bedroom cottage on an island in the NE part on Lavalley Bay.  It was a nice little cottage and most of the week was quiet and peaceful as nobody was around.  The weather was gorgeous and almost too hot for the whole week.  Not the best of weather for Musky hunting, but great vacation weather.  Here's the cottage and view from it.          The day we arrived it rained off and on and I caught these rainbow shots.  Note the colour of the trees in these first pics as compared to the one on the day we left.  It was very cool to watch the trees change colour before our eyes.      This was the size of the moon when we arrived which made the evenings very, very dark.  We had to head back before dark each evening due to our unfamiliarity with the lake and, as mentioned before, the stumps.    The first few evenings were quite cold and the mornings greeted us with a beautiful mist on the waters.    We did try for pickerel each night, but no matter what our tactics, either live bait or jigs at dusk, we only caught bass.  Here is the first fish on board.    So during the days we trolled for musky and caught pike instead.  I did get a musky follow, which looked to be in the 45 inch range, and believe me, we pounded that little cove every day after that, but she was elusive and gave us the slip.  We took a few pike pics, but didn't bother with all as one pike looks pretty much the same as the next          We had a few visitors at our cottage, one every day and he was quite persistent, almost jonesing for peanuts, and got very upset if we didn't comply.        Mussels anyone????     Did you know that if you're on holidays and have nothing to do and sit on the dock soaking up the sun waiting for your bobber to go under you can actually see a mussel move in the sand    Con't......."
116535,Joey,2007-09-23 01:58:00,9122,"Part II  I finally put a half decent smallie on board the last night there on a minnow (fishing for pickerel of course)    Here's an example of some of the stumps    The boat houses on this lake were sometimes nicer than the cottages, they were unbelievable.  Here's one example.      Here's some random scenery shots.    Blueberry Island                      WILSON............     Now here's the same trees the day we left as in the first pics with the rainbow.    So back to the grind Monday morning  Hope you enjoyed the report and pics.  Joey"

116564,Greencoachdog,2007-09-23 03:09:00,8163,"Excellent report and pics Joey!!!  Random scenery pics? Are you sure you weren't at Temagami???  That is a nice fat Pike in the first pic... for it's size!  ... I'm also a big fan of the ""You Can't Bite Me Now, You Little bugger"" hold you demonstrate so well in pics 10 & 13!  Do I need to bring the Sabiki Rig up there and show y'all how to catch the Wall-ice?"

My favs were the rainbow, early fog on the water, and there's that one shot of the fall colours...reflected in the water...you have a wonderful eye for photos.  Maybe your should start a thread in the photography section about fall colours.  Great looking smallie and pike you got there....oh yeah...I guess Paul did good too...hehe.  Trolling for muskie and got pike?  Bly and I were out with fishnsled on Saturday (report later), trolling for muskie and all I got was Walleye....LOL.  Thanks for this report...must have taken forever to pick, resize and edit photos to post...it was a real treat to read."
