117074,DebS,2007-09-24 22:28:00,56,So sorry Mike to hear about your friend Kareem. Keep remembering all the great times you've had together. Some people go through their whole lives without experiencing such a special friendship with someone. My condolences to all of you. DebS
117075,Tarzan's Jane,2007-09-24 22:28:00,1183,"Pain robs us from so much but yet friends dull it with their compassion, caring and company.  Thanks for sharing and may you both have more fishing trips together, the battle isn't over yet."
117083,bigfish1965,2007-09-24 22:59:00,3382,"Great report, guys. Thanks for carrying on the spirit of OFC and for caring about your friend. We all need friends like you guys."
117122,JohnF,2007-09-25 00:52:00,3494,"I've been reading this thread with mixed feelings. I've witnessed close friends' and relatives' demises and know how hard it is for folks to put themselves close to those who are ""bound for glory"". I've seen very caring people who just couldn't bring themselves to go face to face with the condemned. They didn't know how to handle it, so they didn't. For that I heartily commend you guys. I know how hard it is. I've been there, and I know how tempting it is to just walk away and ignore them, taking the easy road.  On the other hand think about your friend's bravery, or fortitude, commitment, love, whatever it's called, for not letting his infirmity get in the way of working with you guys to give him what may well be his last hurrah. Too often those who are sick become so immersed in their own problems that they take their friends' support for granted.  So my hat's off to Kareem too. He's proved what a trooper he is, and what a good friend by his own actions. You're a good lot in my book, all three of you. Would that everyone dealt with these kinds of circumstances with the same poise.  JF"
117132,solopaddler,2007-09-25 01:09:00,8605,"Would just like to say that the comments and pm's from each and every one of you guys is greatly appreciated. Kareem is indeed a special person. The life he's led and the obstacles he's overcome is nothing short of remarkable, believe me I could tell some incredible stories... He's always been an inspiration to me and will continue to be one. I met with him this morning before I left for work. Although he's rapidly going downhill, thanks to a change in his meds the pain is now under control and he's much more aware of what's going on around him. Believe it or not he says he wants to go fishing this weekend   . If there's any possibility of making that happen I will.  Once again thanks everyone, you've been great."
116387,solopaddler,2007-09-22 14:14:00,8605,"As Louis mentioned it was a bittersweet last couple of days. Thursday Kareem was in such good spirits that we actually made tentative plans to fish one of the nearby back lakes on Friday. Another friend of mine who lives up there was going to deliver a light 14' aluminum to the lake we wanted to fish so we'd have something stable for Kareem to fish out of. Thursday evening when we arrived was picture perfect: sunny, nice temps, no wind or bugs. We all sat out on the deck enjoying the view, sharing some laughs and a couple of drinks (including Kareem). It was great.  A bit later Thursday evening me and Louis went out for a quick fish and managed a couple of nice little eaters as Kareem wanted one last fish fry.  They were awesome! Well, as Louis mentioned in his post our back lake trip planned for Friday moring never happened. When we awoke it was obvious that we had to get him home asap, Kareems pain had progressed to such a point that it was unbearable. After quickly loading the boat, even though his pain was intense, he still wanted to troll a bit on the way back to the landing  . That's Kareem in the foreground trying to hook one last fish.  As Louis mentioned he actually hooked a pretty large pike. Got a nice bend in his rod and a couple fast runs then unfortunately it bit him off. Still, he was pretty happy about it. Louis managed to hook a decent smallmouth, tried to hand the rod to Kareem to let him reel it in, but he wouldn't (wasn't his fish  ).   It was a tough, tough trip. No regrets though as even though it ended up like it did I KNOW Kareem enjoyed it. Just found out that he was rushed to emergency this morning.... don't think I'm going to see him again.  Sometimes life really sucks."
116388,Roy,2007-09-22 14:20:00,13728,Thanks for the pics Mike. Nothing else for me to say......

116391,smokinall4s,2007-09-22 14:46:00,89,Nice report and pictures. As for Kareem our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family.
116423,fatherof3,2007-09-22 16:44:00,1769,"good report and pics,great that you guys did this for him"
116433,Whopper,2007-09-22 18:13:00,2174,"Mike I have followed this story and good on you and aniceguy for taking a friend on what might be his last fishing trip here on earth. I really can't see a better last journey. I know you hurt now and you will miss your friend, but in days, weeks and even years to come everytime you think of Kareem it will bring a smile to your soul. May Kareem find peace.  God Bless   Phil"
116442,danbo,2007-09-22 18:47:00,2646,Chin up!........ I wish I had friends like you guys!
116444,Mike the Pike,2007-09-22 19:13:00,3421,Mike good on you to take him out I must admit my eyes are moist  from all that has happened nice to see Kareem willing to troll one more time despite his pain.God Bless thanks for sharing a touching moment.  MTP
116455,aniceguy,2007-09-22 20:35:00,1094,I just downloaded some pics of my camera....  Kareem and Mike  
116466,ccmtcanada,2007-09-22 21:59:00,7971,"Man...what a report.  I think this kind of report personifies what this site is all about...fishing and friends.  I have a rather large lump in my throat as I type this.  You guys are great friends to him....in his time of need.  Just being with you guys out there I'm sure meant the world to him.  His time may be short, but this trip will be remembered forever.  My heart goes out to you guys...these are hard times."
116496,bassmaster4,2007-09-22 23:41:00,801,"good on you guys for trying to make the rest of his short life the best as possible, poor guy those are some cool pics too"
116508,mooseroo,2007-09-23 00:30:00,80,That's a very nice thing for you to do for a friend.
116515,tbayboy,2007-09-23 00:40:00,1497,"Well done guys, we all hope and wish we have friends like you when we're in need."
116522,oxcowboy,2007-09-23 01:11:00,544,"this is one of the best reports i have ever read,  way to go guys!  this is what its all about.  best wishes for your friend and his family.  jason"
116581,Andrew,2007-09-23 05:32:00,54,"As someone who rarely posts, I've been reading these threads and think its amazing that you were able (and Kareem) to get out one last time.  I'm sure this trip made a huge impact on him that he will be forever grateful for.  That being said so will you.  I know it is extremely difficult to watch a friend suffer through a horrible disease but I think the fact that you were able to get him out and even take on that responsiblitiy of having him so far from home speaks wonders of your character.  Although I was a lot younger when my buddy was battling cancer I really had a hard time seeing him at all and dealing with it so basically I didn't.  I was lucky enough to see him the day before he passed, even as the shell of the person he used to be, his spirits were high to the end and I regretted the time I didn't spend with him.  Life is too damn short and we need to spend all the time we can with friends and family!  You and Kareem are definately in my thoughts.  Andrew."
116582,snag,2007-09-23 05:45:00,1932,Bitter sweet.  That last pic reveals a lot in the eyes.

116648,Moosebunk,2007-09-23 14:51:00,3970,Choked up here Mike.  God love you fellas.  That's some report right there.
116649,aniceguy,2007-09-23 15:09:00,1094,"a small good news update perhaps  Kareem called me this morning and was talkative, and in fine spirits, so much so we talked about a trip to quinte soon....They adjusted his medicine and moved him to demerol instead of the perc's and it seemed to make the world of difference in terms of his mental clarity"
116651,mcallister.grant,2007-09-23 15:18:00,327,If only the rest of the world could operate in that fashion that you guys do.... It would be a much better place!!
