504210,Muskieman,2010-09-15 23:31:00,2472,I love this show for some reason .... I'm bigger than this guy and would NEVER be able to eat 1/3 as much as he does.   Randy 
504211,danbouck,2010-09-15 23:34:00,4380,I seen a marathon on Sunday and it was awesome. I can't get over the 30lb pizza with 7 pounds of cheese on it.
504215,uglyfish,2010-09-15 23:44:00,981,"i love that show. my gf still holds firm i could beat most of the challenges he does! lol, i wanna go to florida and get them ""fire in your hole"" wings!! lol"
504220,smally21,2010-09-15 23:53:00,993,"great show - i like the inside looks at all the diners a little more than the gluttony part.  if you like this show you'd probably like guy fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on food network."
504221,otter649,2010-09-15 23:54:00,118,I watch & enjoy the show as well - The host/eater fasts/non eats/drinks alot of water the day before a challenge as well as exercising/working out twice aday on non challenge days............
504229,purekgw,2010-09-16 00:42:00,585,good show i want to try the 4 horseman burger it looks awesome
504240,Ben_Daniels,2010-09-16 01:18:00,435,"I like the show a lot, Boudain's ""No reservations"" is my favorite though.  -Ben"
504242,Ben_Daniels,2010-09-16 01:22:00,435, If you don't eat the day before it makes your stomach shrink and it would be harder to eat a 5 lb burger

504354,ohhenrygsr,2010-09-16 13:48:00,947,"I wish Ontario has more places like man vs food or Dinner, drive ins and dives. But then again we be all over weight like Americans. Does anyone have a special restaurant they would like to share that are like those you see on the food network"
