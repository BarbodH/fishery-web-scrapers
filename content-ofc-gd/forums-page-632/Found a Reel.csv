503950,danbouck,2010-09-14 23:04:00,4380,A little while ago I found this reel at the cottage.  Anybody have any idea what it is or how old it may be??? It still works fine.

504019,mercman,2010-09-15 01:27:00,7054,looks like an old shakespeare spiral cast reel that my grandpa used to use.don't ya just love old stuff

I think it is a classic case of how fast technology has evolved the simple fishing reel.   Art
