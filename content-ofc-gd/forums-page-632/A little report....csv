I wanted carp and she wanted whatever she could get to bite... We fished for just over an hour... I managed one little carp and Averie got into some panfish and a few small bass... Beat's sittin around in the house all day.  Averie kept busy with these while I chummed and waited for a bite...   We got this guy right off the bat.... I've never seen them with sores like that on the side before...   My net girl! haha http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIuByFjAmBM  Averie workin' the big rod...   The kid got a couple small largies also...   This little fish was jumping all over and got her excited...   Had to head home and cook supper but it took the itch off for another week anyways...  Cheers, Ryan"

503579,Beans,2010-09-13 21:59:00,3339," I'll second Mike's remark...  How in hell did you manage the camera and catching carp all at once ???  Was at my kidney specialist's office this morning for results of some tests...  On the 19th of August he outfitted me with a 24 hour blood pressure monitor and seeing as how I was in P'boro I wandered over to Little Lake to wet a line...(when the monitor goes off...I was supposed to stay perfectly still)...At noon I hook up with a 18 to 20 pound carp and sure enough the monitor goes off...it pulled drag till I was close to being spooled but I managed to stay still and eventually net it...My reading for that particular moment was 190/???...very very high for me as I take meds to keep it in line...   He made a remark on the chart ""20 pound carp""...LOL  "
