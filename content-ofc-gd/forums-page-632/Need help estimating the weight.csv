I remeasured a portion of my rod, and estimated about 18"". Any guess on the weight?    Thanks in advance."
503717,bassfanatic25,2010-09-14 03:47:00,36,Around the 3lbs mark I would think.  Nice Fish.
503723,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-09-14 04:51:00,0," I guess I expected too much, the fish fought like a 6 pounder haha"
503760,Dave Bailey,2010-09-14 11:55:00,1641," It's a smallmouth, they always fight above their weight!"
503761,MCTFisher9120,2010-09-14 11:57:00,3761,I would say 3lb 8oz. Something in that 3+ mark. Maybe if the fish was fat like many smallies take the shape of it would/could be a 4. Nice setup btw. What rod/reel is that?
503792,thatleetboy,2010-09-14 13:48:00,143," When I caught the smallie in my profile pic, my BiL sent me this link cuz all we knew was that it was 20 1/4 inches...  By that chart, yours is about 3 and 2/3 pounds.   Cheers"
503805,Mike Pike,2010-09-14 14:08:00,1332,That's a terrific Smallie and sounds like you enjoyed a nice fight on that light equipment.  Congratualtions!
503860,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-09-14 17:05:00,0," It is a 6'6 UL Shimano Compre rod with a Shimano Saros 1000F reel. A very light combo for the money, turns average smallies like these into a world record.  Thank you all for your responses, 3 lbs. sounds like a good estimate. Hopefully I'll catch her again next year."
