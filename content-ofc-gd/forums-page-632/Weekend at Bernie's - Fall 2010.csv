503825,fishnsled,2010-09-14 15:05:00,3520," Absolutely not!  By using a marshmellow it helps to keep the jig off bottom, right in the strikezone.  Similar to blowing up a worm or using a floating jighead.  The mellow also adds a little sweetness that seems to drive the fish nuts."
503833,Headhunter,2010-09-14 15:29:00,5703,"Awe, man Bernie, I sorry for that! May I suggest the following cure, as it seems to have worked for me: -BEER! Gotta keep your fluids up! -Ceasars - Gotta keep the vitamins coming -Vodka - a little tonic and a slice of lime, again, strictly for vitamin intake! I knew I shouldhave left those lemons for yah! Hope you get better soon B! HH ps... FnS... please don't be giving away all our hard earned knowlege with regard to techniques and bait to be used on Nip... we want there to be fish left for us on our next visit!"
503838,Blue Lk,2010-09-14 15:43:00,337,"Perhaps we shud get together & car pool down there.We could show those guys from the south how northern fisherman catch them. Well you could show them how to fish & I could show them how to drink. I'm just kidding,great post,THX for shareing."
503842,fishnsled,2010-09-14 15:53:00,3520,"  It's no secret since Cliff didn't photoshop out the baits.   Figured since the damage was done, it didn't matter."
503843,Harrison,2010-09-14 16:00:00,2202," Maybe you should use your pinky next time you go digging.  Looks like a great trip gents!!  Now lets go get some smallies, you guys get your shirts?"
503844,Headhunter,2010-09-14 16:00:00,5703,Do you northern guys use smaller marshmellows? Or do you prefer the coloured one's? HH
503849,capt bruce,2010-09-14 16:11:00,820,"one day I hope to make the big league and get a change to spend some time with you guys . Too bad about the water this year hope they get things up there worked out , but good food ,good company , water even if its shallow ,boats, makes for life time memories , didnt see any pics of ccmt and headhunter playing guitars , dont tell me no camp fire sing alongs ?? Im jealous as Im sure many are. B"
503851,Headhunter,2010-09-14 16:18:00,5703,"Hey Bruce, As CCMT was only going to be up for a day, we decided to not bring our guitars... not enough time to warrant the effect it would have on our drinking time! LOL I'm sure we'll be serenading Gerritt with the Lake Nip version of ""Brown Eyed Girl"" come February! LMAO Phil, there was no digging required at the time of that photo... just needed something to stop it from dripping all over myself, again! HH"
503853,Bernie,2010-09-14 16:27:00,3190,Thanks for the advise Dr. Joe. I think there are a couple of shriveled up lemons from the May trip in the fridge. There may be some vitamins left in them.  Think we might be able to get some florescent pink marshmallows that glow in the dark for the next trip?
503854,Headhunter,2010-09-14 16:35:00,5703,"Com'on  Bernie, don't be giving away ALL our secrets!!! I can just see it now, all the Ice condo's with marshmellow bags scatered all over the ice...there might not be any Pickereyes left to net! HH"
503868,ccmtcanada,2010-09-14 17:31:00,7971,I knew I shouldn't have posted those pics with the marshmallows in them!!!
503869,Spiel,2010-09-14 17:38:00,9065,Looks like I missed a good time and hell even I would likely have been able to catch a cold.  Lemon something or other is apparently good for colds.....
503930,Gerritt,2010-09-14 22:00:00,6129,"thanks for posting the report and our pics Cliff! Joe, myself and my buddy Joe all had this head cold.. Brutal!  Bernie.. it is a good excuse for a few days off... need some company? Bawahahaha!  As always gentlemen I had a great time, and I look forward to our winter trip..  But please.. can we make it longer? there never seems to be enough time to catch up..  We do this 3 times a year and it seems the time spent up there gets shorter and shorter..  good friends, good times, good food and great conversation...  The lemons dont hurt either...  problem  is with us all sick.. we have probably put the lemon farmers out of business!.. as a total of ONE lemon was murdered on this trip.... ONE!!!!  As for the marshmallows... I will not divulge what color I caught my 21""r on..  G."
503961,Leecher,2010-09-14 23:32:00,7832,Great report and pics Cliff Sounds like fun was had by everyone..... doesn't get any better then that Thanks for sharing your trip with us!!! Leechman
503531,ccmtcanada,2010-09-13 16:42:00,7971,"So...a sure sign that summer is coming to an end is the annual trip up to Lake Nipissing to visit Bernie.  This time around it was Gerritt (and his buddy Joe), Headhunter, Fishnsled and myself.  I was the last to arrive, as I had to work Friday morning.  The first thing I noticed was how bad the water levels really are!  It's one thing to hear about it...even see a picture or two, but when you are standing at the boat launch and look around, it really hits you.  The view of the docks set WAYYYY down in the water at the launch.   The boat houses in the launch area look like this...just as Bernie has to do, they have to beach their boats inside!   I arrived around 530pm at the launch and Bernie came by to pick me up.  When I got to his place, the guys were all there already.  I was more than a few drinks behind and had some catching up to do!   I took a walk around and once again, the water levels just amazed me...here's his dock out front...those 2x4s were put there back in the spring so boats wouldn't just go right under the dock.  The levels are even lower now and the dock is unuseable!   Venturing out back to the other dock and you are greeted with this...there used to be a lake here!   As usual, the dinners were amazing...Gerritt was up first and treated us to a feast!  After dinner we all caught up with each other...had some drinks....played some cards....had some more drinks...had some more drinks and oh yeah...had some more drinks!  In true Nipissing fashion, as the sun set on this day...the sunset always looks so great!   The next morning, we were treated to perfect fishing weather.  It was a little cool outside, but it was shaping up to be a great day!   Gotta love it up here...imagine sitting down to this view with your morning coffee!   Anyhow...we did manage to get out fishing!!  I'm  not a fan of photoshopping, so the hot baits are not wiped out or obliterated in these pics.  Joe, with a nice jumbo...   The perch loved this bait!!!   I even managed a walleye!!   Bernie had Gerritt and Joe in his boat and they all caught as well...  Bernie with a nice picker-eye!   Gerritt's picker-eye!   And Joe wasn't left out either!  If you look closely, there is a fish in his hands....   Headhunter was as classy as ever...poor guy had a little cold and went to no expense to let us know how crappy he felt.   Fishnsled and I headed out after lunch again to see what we could stir up and I managed what may be my biggest largie to date!  It attacked my bait as soon as it hit the surface of the water!   Here's the release...   After yet another amazing dinner courtesy of Fishnsled, we headed out for the evening bite!  We fished in the same area....and wouldn't you know it....Headhunter and I with a double header!    Ok...so we both managed to hook Bernie's anchor line at the same time!!! LOL.  A short time later, I heard commotion from the other boat!  Bernie has a MONSTER on!  The thing keeps taking him deep...it wont come to the surface.  Finally, after a lengthy battle, Gerritt nets the fish!   The money shot!!!   Gerritt said ""you have to hold it up Bernie!!!""  Bernie says ""No way am I touching that thing!!!!""  We know who won that arguement!! LOL  Fishnsled managed to pull a nice smallie and a picker-eye up during the evening as well...     Once again gentlemen...I had a GREAT time up there.  Hope to be back this winter for the ice fishing!  Many thanks to Bernie once again for allowing us onto his island paradise...and to all the guys who always makes these trips memorable."
503534,Nipfisher,2010-09-13 16:53:00,2449,What is with the mashmallows?    I have never heard of them / seen them used on Nip.
503536,Pigeontroller,2010-09-13 17:06:00,2793,Nice report Clavin!
503538,mercman,2010-09-13 17:14:00,7054,great post !!! got some nice fish there. Those sheepshead fight like crazy don't they. They have such nice eyes  
503539,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-13 17:16:00,2690,"LOL...think I caught the same sheepshead at Long Point Bay this weekend.  Sounds like a good time, and, once again, wow on the water levels this year."
503540,Terry,2010-09-13 17:16:00,14456,real good report there sounds like a good time   and I see Joe caught a fish or 2...LOL  but if he was on BOQ he would show you how to catch the big ones
503541,corvette1,2010-09-13 17:22:00,1765,looks like you guys had a great time congrats
503542,TJQ,2010-09-13 17:25:00,7806,Great Report... Bernies a class act!!
503545,solopaddler,2010-09-13 18:03:00,8605,"Seems like it's becoming a tradition with you guys.  Looks like a blast, glad to see you were able to go bud."
503550,Joey,2010-09-13 18:57:00,9122,Great report Cliff.  Looks like a bunch of fun.  Nice Sheepy Bernie  Joey
503557,Bernie,2010-09-13 19:13:00,3190,Thanks for the fun guys. Always a good time.  Thanks Joey. Next sheephead I get I will cook it to see if the seagulls will eat it. They don't eat them raw. How good can they be if a seagull won't eat it?  Them marshmallows worked pretty good  Great job on the report Cliff !
503576,danc,2010-09-13 21:27:00,4677,Looks like you guys had a blast. Annual trips with friends are the best!!!
503589,limeyangler,2010-09-13 22:42:00,5204,"Great report and pics Cliff, congrats on a nice looking largie...  Classic middle finger pose...lol.  Looks like fun...thanks for posting..."
503675,GBW,2010-09-14 01:27:00,8460,great report and it looks like those mallows worked well too...
503682,anonymous,2010-09-14 01:56:00,58,"I gotta get in on the Weekend's at Bernie's again. Made the first one, and then the first winter trip but haven't been back since"
503691,fishnsled,2010-09-14 02:20:00,3520,"Great report Cliff, thanks for putting it together.  Great friends and some new ones made, great food - I don't think anyone was feeling peckish, some fishing and catching, a few beverages and a ton of laughs.  AWESOME time as always.  Thanks for the hospitality Bernie!!  Can hardly wait till the next one."
503702,highdrifter,2010-09-14 03:02:00,2534,"Good to see you in the mix again Cliff.  You're right about the water levels..  That water line has been at the same spot for years and then poof, a meter lower!!  In fact, we saw another water line about another meter up in some places..  Hope it gets better then worse up there.  It was a really tough go at Lakair for Laz and me this year.  You guys did alright though!!  cheers HD"
503730,Moosebunk,2010-09-14 06:23:00,3970,"There's the man!!! CCMT.  Good show fellas.  Caught this earlier... I like the pic of sick Joe, funny!!!"
503738,Tarzan's Jane,2010-09-14 10:28:00,1183,Great stuff!  I began feeling a bit light headed just reading about the drinks And not a bad little camera you have there - nice pics.
503762,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-14 11:59:00,0,"Great report. Looks like lots of fish were caught, and fun was had. I've seen Nipissing pretty low but it always comes back up. The experts are saying this is going to be a cold and nasty winter with lots of snow, so it will be good for our lakes."
503780,Headhunter,2010-09-14 13:21:00,5703,"Thanks for doingup the report Cliff! And thanks for taking my picture with a snot rag hanging out of my nose! I couldn't believe it when I woke up Friday morning, full blown cold, after lookin forward to this weekend all summer. Thanks again Bernie, as well as Gerritt and Will for cookin up a storm for us... myself, I tried to keep my fluid levels up and make the best of it! Already lookin forward to the ice GTG! I am truly amazed at how multi-species a simple little sundry item like marshmellows can be! Yah just can't beat 'em for bait! BTW -  Will and I drove all over North Bay lookin for Pickereye fillets to take home, but no luck! I gotta give kudos to the guy in Midland who set FishnSled up with a part he needed for his trolling motor. Will had called ahead and found this part at a shop in Midland. WE drove from the ""Shwa"" to Midland to get the part, before heading to Nip. When we got there, we found that he did not have the correct part to sell FnS. But he did take the part off a floor model motor and helped Will install it, all for the palrty sum of $8.00! You simply will not find that level of service in the big city... so a huge thumbs up to the dealer in Midland (Can't remember the name, maybe Will will chime in) who went far beyond the call of duty, to get us on our way. HH"
503806,fishnsled,2010-09-14 14:09:00,3520," Hey Joe, hope you are feeling better.  So far so good for me.  If you are ever in the Midland area and are having problems with your Motorguide trolling motor or just need some bait or tackle, stop into Backwater Tackle and ask for Brian.  Top notch guy! He saved us a lot of headaches over the weekend by setting us up with the part and install.  It's worth the drive to Midland.  Here is his website Backwater Tackle"
503815,Bernie,2010-09-14 14:36:00,3190,"Hey Joe, thanks for the cold.  At least I get it now and not in hunting season."
503819,fishnsled,2010-09-14 14:44:00,3520,"  OH NO!!  That's too bad Bernie.  You should have had more lemons I guess.   As you said, better now then during the hunting season.  Hope you're feeling better soon."
503822,MJL,2010-09-14 14:56:00,2427,Great to see you're out fishing Cliff.  Gotta hook up with you this fall!  Nicely done guys  Is it just me or is that a giant white marshmellow?  Were you trying to line walleye?
