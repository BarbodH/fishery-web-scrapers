""Car-hopping"" thefts on rise in Durham Region By ROB LAMBERTI, Toronto Sun  Last Updated: September 8, 2010 3:42pm Email Story Print Size A A A Report Typo Share with: Facebook Digg Del.icio.us Google Stumble Upon Newsvine Reddit Technorati Feed Me Yahoo Simpy Squidoo Spurl Blogmarks Netvouz Scuttle Sitejot + What are these? Just lock the car door.  “Car-hopping” — where burglars check for unlocked vehicle doors and then snatch prized items — occurs up to 10 times a day, every day in Durham Region, police said Wednesday.  And it could be cut dramatically by simply locking vehicle doors.  Thieves focus on computer equipment, GPS units, satellite radios, wallets, sports equipment and anything else of value.  The trend hasn’t stopped despite earlier pleas by police to have motorists lock their vehicle doors or put personal property into the trunk, Durham Regional Police Sgt. Nancy Van Rooy said.  “The numbers are high and it is a concern,” she said.  Police said a thief or thieves go through dozens of vehicles within a neighbourhood looking specifically for unlocked vehicles. Car-hopping is a crime of opportunity and it’s rare that a windshield is smashed to gain access into a locked car, police said."
502660,jbailey,2010-09-09 15:50:00,866,"CRIME OF THE WEEK  Sometime between Sept. 1 and 3, someone broke into a cottage on Toad Lake near Port Loring, according to Near North Crime Stoppers and the Powassan detachment of the Ontario Provincial Police.  The cottage can be accessed by water only.  Once inside, the culprit or culprits made off with an older .22-calibre rifle, about 500 antique fishing lures, six fishing rods and reels, six tackle boxes, a Hummingbird fish finder, a Shindowa chainsaw, a Daisy BB gun and two mounted fish, a pike and a smallmouth bass. The value of stolen property is estimated at $4,000.  Anyone with information is asked to call Near North Crime Stoppers at 476-8477."
502698,DanD,2010-09-09 18:15:00,2223,"Here’s a good one to add to the tread. My son’s restored 79 Firebird was stolen from him twice. The fist time was in May of this year; all we have found of it are pieces of the smashed steering column and the license plates; that were returned to us, after the police found them in another stolen car. The second time was just a couple of weeks ago; that’s when the insurance company informed us that they were NOT going pay the claim. They said because of the “performance enhancements” that were installed on the vehicle they are within their rights to deny the claim. The specific enhancement item that they are talking about is nitrous oxide. Nitrous according to the highway traffic is legal to have installed on a street driven vehicle; as long as the system cannot be charged (bottle opened) from the passenger’s compartment. My son sure as heck couldn’t the nitrous bottle is still sitting in the basement at the house! It only went into the trunk after we were at the race track for “test & tune” nights out at Sparta or Grand Bend. So be careful; check with your insurance as to what constitutes performance enhancements in their dictionary. It could be anything from an “up-graded set of spark plugs, too a free flowing exhaust system” according to the insurance adjuster. So, just because it’s legal doesn’t mean that the insurance company won’t try and snivel out of paying your claim. At least with the second set of thieves we know who they are and our lawyer has been informed.  Dan"
503904,drummerburns,2010-09-14 20:18:00,1,"I apologize for this being my first post as I've been lurking around the forums for quite some time.  I actually had my net stolen out of the box of my pickup truck while night fishing the aquaduct at the Welland River a couple months ago.  I grew up in Welland and came back for some nostalgic fishing from back in my childhood and couldn't believe someone would lift a fishing net.  I had picked it up from Pete's in St. Catharines for over $80 and only had it a couple months... it was too big to fit in the cab and I don't have a cover for the back, but surprisingly enough, I had left it in there parked overnight in Toronto, Burlington, St. Catharines... let's just say it was pretty disappointing having someone from my hometown be the one to steal it.  The last place I thought it would grow legs!  Whatever happened to the fishermen's code... I can understand finding a lure somewhere... but when you find rods, reels, nets, tackle boxes... just leave them... the person will eventually realize and be back for them.  Outside of my disappointment I did want to reiterate that I am a fan of the site and will hopefully be posting more often in the future!   Thanks,   Burns."
503941,GBW,2010-09-14 22:48:00,8460,Welcome to the site Burns.  As for Durham area car hit's.  They did my street in the spring.  It's happens every day as long as there are kids (16 to 22) in the area.  My area was also the focus of the house B-N-E's in the day too last summer.
502407,jbailey,2010-09-08 18:31:00,866,"So on the weekend I was up near Whitestone fishing, a friend and I rented a boat from the marina. We finished fishing for the day and docked the boat, left our gear in the boat and walked to the truck which was maybe 80-100m away. We were setting up a propane BBQ when I decided I would go back to the boat and get my camera to take a couple photos. I get to the boat and my stringer and pliers are on the floor in the boat, and a new pack of cigarettes was open with only 2 taken.. It didn't appear that anything else was out of place, but I had been in to a few beverages and it was dark out, so I shrugged it off thinking I was crazy or paranoid. Anyway we pack up and leave for the night. The next morning we get back and head out to our first spot. I go to pick up my new mojo bass rod and citica reel, but there was a daiwa reel on my mojo and my citica was gone, my buddies RType rod was gone - the daiwa reel attached to my rod.  We had about 10 rods in the boat - they chose a rod and reel and put it together in a matter of 10mins - while in vision of where we were cooking.. ballsy to say the least. Fortunately my buddy had customized his RType with a little fenwick logo on the bottom.  So we fly back to the marina and speak to the guy who runs it (really nice guy, very helpful!) and we explained the scenario and he told us there were some older teens staying in their parents trailer and he would wait for them at the dock when they come back in fishing. At this point my buddy and I thought it was a real longshot at getting our equipement back, but when we arrived back at the dock that night, the marina guy had our rod and reel for us!! Just amazing - the only downside is I didn't get a chance to have some choice words with them myself! Ah well probably for the better and I'm glad they didn't attempt to take everything!  What about the rest of you? Anyone else run into this type of scenario?"
502408,Rizzo,2010-09-08 18:37:00,4754,very bizarre. Why not just grab it and run? Can't believe they took the time to swap reels etc. had all my musky lures taken a few years back (well over $1000). Felt absolutely sick about it...then I went shopping
502411,Rod Caster,2010-09-08 18:44:00,5784," Three years ago in a mess of confusion I had left my tackle bag and my new rod/reel combo near the dock of a lodge. (a friend was supposed to get all the gear and blah blah) I came back the next day and it was GONE. It's my own stupid fault, but it was a small lodge with mostly ""regulars"" and no one fessed up to taking my stuff, even the owners seemed disappointed. I was not happy, and I'm still recovering from that loss. My name was all over the gear with my phone number and everything. I learned a solid lesson that day."

A few years ago, I remember reading of a guy at Port Credit having had a heart attack or some other medical condition (actually I am not even sure he made it), but while he was  being attended to by the paramedics, someone stole either his fishing rod or wallet.  Can;t remember the exact details but I believe they got the guy."

I've had my car broken into twice...thankfully both times they didn't pop the truck, i keep a lot in there, could've been much worse.....most significant things i lost were a watch(which i got back by routinely checking the pawn shop in our small town) and my grandpa's jack knife"
502421,aplumma,2010-09-08 19:13:00,6896,Many years ago I had someone break into my work truck and take all of the power tools in cases and all of the products faucets and Garbage disposals that were in sale-able boxes. Cops were called but they were sure they went to assorted flea markets over the state lines. So far we have never had anyone brave enough to come on the farm and remove something we all have ways to detain the person till the ambulance arrives.   Art
502422,fisher,2010-09-08 19:13:00,451,"Or how about my neighbour last year...  It was a cold winter morning.  He was going to go out for the day and had just started the car in his garage when he realized he forgot something in the house.  Just as he was about to go get it, he thought he would take his 4 year old son into the house with him (he had just strapped him into the back seat).  Luckily he did that because when he got back, he sees his car driving away.  Not only did his car get stolen from right under him, as he was standing on his porch speaking on the phone with the police, he sees his car drive by the street again with 2 teenagers in it.  As they were driving by, they decide to play with his garage door opener - up and down.  They eventually got the guys but it was just a slap on the wrist for them and a waste of a day in court for my neighbour.  Talk about being gutsy!"

Sep 19, 2007 - 12:00 AM |  0 Man accused of stealing from dying fisherman A Kitchener man is accused of stealing from a dying man at Bronte Harbour.  Early Friday morning, police say, a 68-year-old man was fishing at Bronte Harbour when he suddenly collapsed.  Another fisherman rushed to the man's aid, performing CPR until an ambulance arrived, but despite these efforts the man died in hospital a short time later.  Police say this tragic event was compounded by the fact that while the victim lay fighting for his life, another man walked over and stole the victim's fishing equipment.  ""While the other people on the pier were performing CPR this man goes up and starts to reel in the victim's line and then walks off with his rod and equipment,"" said Sgt. Peter Payne, Halton Police Media officer.  ""He had only just expired and these people were performing lifesaving measures to try and keep him alive and do what they could for him. This individual took it upon himself to seize that moment and steal from someone at their absolute weakest moment.""  With the assistance of those present, police say, the thief was identified, arrested and charged.  Jamie Harland Gross, 24, of Kitchener, has been charged with theft and two counts of breach of probation.  At press time he was remanded in custody awaiting a bail hearing."

502431,lew,2010-09-08 19:45:00,12766,"I'll give 2 boat related stories involving thieves.  Story # 1....For years we had a house trailer in a small park in the Kawarthas and I always left my boat in the water all summer long. I bought a brand new boat in 1985 and decided to chain it to the dock when not in use.  I had to go home on a Friday to work the weekend and my wife was gonna be at the lake with her girl friend so I unlocked the boat so they could use it.  Saturday morning the girls head down to the lake to go for a boat ride and the boat is gone from the dock    The lady that owned the park lived right beside the water and my dock and when Diane enquired about the missing boat, the owner said she heard it start up and take off at 4:00 A.M. She knew I was a very early riser so just assumed it was me going fishing.  The police were called, plus a few of my buds went out on the lake to search for it and sure enuff they found it 5 miles away run up on a beach. No serious damage was done and the thieves were never found.  Story #......2  It was in the same trailer park about 20 years ago when 4 loud mouth punks rented a cottage for the summer. They were all about 18-20 years old and none of them worked, but they had an old bassboat with a big motor and they just roared around the lake all day long. We wondered where they were getting all the $$ for gas and then after awhile guys in the park were having gas stolen from their boats.  One of our boys    had an old Jerry can and put in 2 gallons of gas and 2 gallons  of COKE, then left it sitting on the seat of his boat, and sure enuff it was empty in the morning. We sat down at the beach in the morning and watched the punks take off for a boat ride but they only made it a very short distance before the motor gave up the ghost. It wouldn't start and they had to flag down a passing boat for a tow back to the dock.  They hauled the boat & motor of to a mechanic but said later it would be too expensive to repair  They left the park shortly after that and were never seen again and nobody ever had any gas stolen again either after they left"

I know this because it was sitting on our cooler, the teens were fly fishing, and we thought nothing of them then all of a sudden they got real quiet and left. Not thinking much of it we carried on, I went to take a pic of my kids and vioala no more camera. I remember what they look like and if I see them again I am gonna say something.

My friends called to to go over to his place, so I did, holding my rod, leaving my fishing box back, since I only leave for a few minutes and there are not a lot of people here.

Its a sad statement that so many of us have been through this. The guys who stole it wouldn't even get enough for a case of beer but it costs us how much to replace?"

An Ad agency that I worked would give us Lexus to drive if we wanted. The account person had his car in the shop so he took one, LS400. $85,000+. Went out to dinner and when he came out two hours laters it was gone and all they found was the lock sitting on the pavement!

I went out for a bit.  Came back home and my television was gone.  The left over baby formula was emptied into a different container. I knew right away who took my television - they did.  The nerve after I looked after their little one for free. So I called the police.  An officer came, I told him the story and we drove to their home and confronted them.  They denied taking my television.  The officer and I went back to the cruiser, I convinced him to get the guy to open his garage.  I was sure my television was there. He did, and it was not there.  The officer took me back home and as we are pulling up to my residence I see my brother taking a television out of a car. He had borrowed the television to take to a friends house.  He needed the container that the formula was in to make some kind of drink.  I had something to do.  And so walked the 30 minutes back to the people that I had just accused.  Said my apologies and walked away feeling like a total twit.  Huge learning lesson that day."
502585,Stoty,2010-09-09 12:10:00,2910,"When I lived in Pickering (go figure).... some little PUNKS hit my truck. They took about $4000 worth of stuff from it, including a top-of-the-line stereo system, complete with an in-dash DVD player, custom made Rockford Fosgate amp/sub, tools, movies, you name it!  It feels as though you've been violated. You feel kinda dirty about it. Never did find out who...which is probably a good thing, cause I'd be facing 25-life for murder!    But as for your story...that's pathetic. Talk about Canada's DUMBEST criminals. 1) When you steal..DONT leave stuff in it's place 2) Try to make it less obvious, because the guy at the store pretty much knew who it was 3) They are lucky you didnt meet up with them...  I'm sorry but little PUNKS that steal really need to be taught a lesson. I can almost guarentee that if someone got caught stealing something and got their   kicked... chances are they wont do it again.  It's sad how the world operates now, when parents can get charged for spanking their own children, and its next to impossible for kids to fail highschool. We need to stop BABYING these kids, and teach them about the real world... man oh man.  What would you boss do if he caught you stealing? Just make you put it back and warn you? Ummm.. NO! I'm not very old, but the world needs to go back to the ""old school"" days of sleeping in the bed you make for yourself, no matter what the price."
