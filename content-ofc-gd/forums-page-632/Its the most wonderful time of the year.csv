503766,dobee,2010-09-14 12:17:00,301,"Was out at the bronte pier last night and ill say that when i was there only me and a handful of others were the ONLY ones casting lures... everyone else was ""bottom bouncing""...  I must hand it to one fellow who was casting spoons and he snagged a realy nice coho, i netted it for him, and he quickly realized it was snagged and released the fish immediately! you dont see that very often, especially at bronte!"
503770,BITEME,2010-09-14 12:48:00,1968,I dont keep any fish at all  not for eggs or any other reason just for line pulling fun thats it.
503777,dobee,2010-09-14 13:04:00,301,nothing beats a freight train hitting your spoon and taking you to hamilton
503789,Headhunter,2010-09-14 13:43:00,5703,"Peter, do you prefer the Kraft brand or will ""No Name"" work just as well? HH"
503795,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-14 13:54:00,0,  so...  How do you fish that rig?
503798,markiemark70,2010-09-14 13:57:00,158,Don't let the resident salmon snobs see that. Apparently using a marshmallow makes you a knuckle dragging snagger.
503802,GBW,2010-09-14 14:02:00,8460,"isn't the saying ""go big or gome home"" good with the mallows too?"

503826,blaque,2010-09-14 15:08:00,2419,"did a pier trip this past weekend. i stopped in the shop just inside the harbor and right up at the register, at the impulse buy spot, was two boxes of some sort of wacky pretied rigs. I said, hmmmmm, whats in the box. He said ""tight line rigs"" We got em in chartreuse and flourescent orange. I didnt uncoil it to see exactly what it was, but in the ziplock bag was a coil of mono with a single hook tied on, a treble hook tied below that and each hook had a tiny glow in the dark tube jig on it? There was a styro glow spinner in there somewhere as well."
503881,BITEME,2010-09-14 18:19:00,1968,  I try to stay away from both brands they leave a sticky residue in my ears and when its hot out its disgusting
503884,Headhunter,2010-09-14 18:24:00,5703,My mistake! I can see this as a multi-use piece of tackle... great for fish and even greater once you get home late and the chirpin starts! HH
503907,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-09-14 20:35:00,0,"ok I have to admit, I'm really new here. Do marshmallows really work, better than using a roe bag?"
503915,Roy,2010-09-14 20:57:00,13728," Oh hell yeah! Salmon guys love those things....I think they call it ""matching the hatch""."

504061,Twocoda,2010-09-15 02:51:00,4130, i agree ....good icecream in hamilton too
