I'm sure there are different size guides to buy?  What type of adhesive do I use?  Should I wrap it in the thread I see on other guides?  Should I apply a coat of varnish after wrapping the thread?  Any suggestions & help is appreciated.  Thanx folks"

503202,Spiel,2010-09-12 12:44:00,9065,Did it break above or below the next guide from the tip?
503461,wormdunker,2010-09-13 07:13:00,1711,Spiel  It broke just above the second guide.
503870,Spiel,2010-09-14 17:40:00,9065, I'm thinking the best fix would be to cut it off with a Dremel tool (or the like) as close to the last remaining guide as possible. Though I honestly think you'd be better off replacing the rod.   
504079,wormdunker,2010-09-15 08:26:00,1711,Thanx Spiel but My daughter already has it fixed.  She went into a local shop (Windsor) - the guy just cut off the rod at the second guide & glued on a new tip guide all in 5 minutes or less.  My grandson is now good to go!!  It's an inexpensive rod for a beginner.  He is 9 years old.  He loves the rod cause it was an Easter present from grandpa!!
