504171,esoxansteel,2010-09-15 19:52:00,1307,"  The Dr is right on that one as there are different species of lampreys and your no where close to any of the great lakes, only way possible would be for some fool to bring from one of the great lakes and dump into rainy"
504007,Guest Manitoubass,2010-09-15 01:12:00,0,"Never, ever seen one until I snagged one today with a flat rap.  A truly digusting looking creature, lol, the gloves came out to remove it off the treble hook, haha.  Anyone else see these anywhere?  I wasn't sure if it was invasive of not, so I took a few pics, checked out the MNR site and filled out the form"
504010,Guest Manitoubass,2010-09-15 01:17:00,0,"edit.  was in Rainy River, not Rainy lake"
504013,bare foot wader,2010-09-15 01:20:00,1354,for sure a lamprey? american eels are often mistaken for lamprey....
504014,Roy,2010-09-15 01:22:00,13728,Lamprey and eels are not even comparable. Do you have a pic?
504015,Guest Manitoubass,2010-09-15 01:25:00,0,"Yeah, after checking the pics for comparison, I'm sure it's a lamprey. I have some pics, but none of them turned out very well, so it's tough to tell by the pics what type of lamprey it actually is. "
504016,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-15 01:25:00,0,"i could be terribly wrong on my geography but i don't think you have a sea lamprey problem in rainy river.   there are lamprey native to canada.  given the fact that you are not located anywhere close to the great lakes, i would presume you found and Ichtyomyzon."
504020,Roy,2010-09-15 01:28:00,13728,Lamprey for sure.
504022,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-15 01:30:00,0,
504023,Guest Manitoubass,2010-09-15 01:30:00,0," I've fished this river for 25 years, and this is the first one Ive ever seen"
504025,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-15 01:33:00,0,this is 99.9% not a sea lamprey.
504026,Guest Manitoubass,2010-09-15 01:33:00,0,another pic 
504027,Guest Manitoubass,2010-09-15 01:34:00,0, why is this?  any idea of what it is then?
504030,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-15 01:37:00,0," as i posted above, i believe this to be a silver lamprey, not a sea lamprey.  a silver lamprey is native to your waters, and nothing to worry about.  i work in lamprey control."
504031,Roy,2010-09-15 01:38:00,13728,"Yes, they're native to Rainy river and Lake of the Woods."
504032,Guest Manitoubass,2010-09-15 01:39:00,0," cool, thanks for the info.  I just wanted to make sure, as like I said, I've never seen one before.  Still, creepy buggers"
504034,highdrifter,2010-09-15 01:41:00,2534, Exactly.  Could be a brook or a silver lamprey.  Looks to be about the right size.  A silver lamprey isn't parasitic and they're good indicators of a healthy ecosystem.  You let it go?
504038,Guest Manitoubass,2010-09-15 01:45:00,0," No I didn't let it go.  It was killed in the process of removing my hooks (was hooked in three different spots, one almost through the mouth)"
504039,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-15 01:48:00,0, Actually silver lamprey ARE parasitic... But they are a healthy indicator and not detrimental to the fish population in any way.
504040,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-15 01:50:00,0,http://pond.dnr.cornell.edu/nyfish/Petromyzontidae/silverlamprey.html  There is also some suggestion that silver lamprey (Ichthyomyzon unicuspis) and the northern brook lamprey (Ichthyomyzon fossor which is non-parasitic) are more closely related than originally thought and may be the same species.
504045,Roy,2010-09-15 01:57:00,13728,"Yeah, Doc. Most of the lampreys we see here, in muskie water, are non parasitic. I don't know why that is because sea lamprey range is all through here and the Great Lakes."
504048,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-15 02:02:00,0,pretty neat and rare occurrence to snag a native lamprey regardless.
504051,highdrifter,2010-09-15 02:13:00,2534, oh yeah right..  brooks are the ones that feed on benthic invertebrates.  thanks dude.
504078,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-15 04:32:00,0,i believe they are filter feeders. i think they munch on detritus etc.
504142,Governator,2010-09-15 16:19:00,879,That would just freak the crap out of me.
504147,Headhunter,2010-09-15 16:45:00,5703,"So, if it was not released, inquiring minds need to know... how did it taste? HH"
