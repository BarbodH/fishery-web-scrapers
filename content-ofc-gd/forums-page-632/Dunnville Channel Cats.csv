503685,rhymobot,2010-09-14 02:05:00,174,So are the channel cats in the Grand in Dunnvile there year round?  Should I still be able to catch them this time of the year?
503782,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-14 13:26:00,0," From what I understand?Yes, but the real big ones are more common in the spring(right after ice out, till june) when they are spawning."
504075,fishinguypat,2010-09-15 03:50:00,547,i know a friend that went 3 nights straight without catching any a few days ago... although his friend had caught many so it depends where you go on the river
