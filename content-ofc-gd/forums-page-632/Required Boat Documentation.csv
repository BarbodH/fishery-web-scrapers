504420,Rae,2010-09-16 16:59:00,21,"Do you just need the boat license (service Canada paper that issues your boat #'s) and proof of Insurance? And your operators card. Is there anything else I should have in the boat?  I was in the US last week getting a used boat and I'm almost done with all the paperwork, hopefully tomorrow will be my maiden voyage. I just want to be sure I have all the documentation in case I get pulled over on the water.  Rae"
504422,lookinforwalleye,2010-09-16 17:03:00,4399,"I have never been asked for proof of insurance, only the boat license and now your operators card, I always keep a copy of the trailer ownwerships in the tow vehicle."
504423,stubbex1,2010-09-16 17:03:00,164,"All i ever have with me is the service canada paperwork that matches the hull number.  I'm not sure about the insurance......i've been pulled over by the opp boat many times, they have never asked for any documents.  K.S  "
504425,ohhenrygsr,2010-09-16 17:12:00,947,"Things i have in my boat.  Service Canada document laminated, insurance, boaters card and fishing license.  The opp usually bring out the MNR while on there inspections.  All this put into a dry bag"
504426,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-16 17:15:00,2690,There was a thread on this awhile back.  It is also a good idea to have proof of ownership (copy of the bill of sale). For towing make sure you have trailer ownership as well.
504437,spooner_jr,2010-09-16 17:56:00,193,"You don't need liability insurance to operate a boat in Ontario.  You need to have the vessel license (ownership), and I believe they now require you to keep your bill of sale on board as well."
504447,smally21,2010-09-16 19:07:00,993,"pleasure craft licence and proof of ownership (bill of sale). no insurance but if ya have ya might as well show it.  The Pleasure Craft License is free of charge and transferable to any subsequent owner of the vessel. The license must be carried on board the vessel at all times. However, a license is not a Title Document. Vessel operators must therefore also carry other documents, such as a document that establishes ownership or registration, in order to help avoid/reduce delays clearing US-Canada customs or in case of a fine.  ""registration"" does not come into play until the vessel exceeds 15 tonnes, and is considered ownership but again, not on your boat or mine, unless ya got a really, really big boat.  there is no document from Service Canada or any other agency that qualifies as ownershiop of a pleasure craft."
504453,Fisherman,2010-09-16 19:52:00,7201," Amen, finally."
504454,Governator,2010-09-16 20:01:00,879,"Just to clarify for others, you only require the pleasure craft license if your boat exceeds 10hp, hence why everything is 9.9."
