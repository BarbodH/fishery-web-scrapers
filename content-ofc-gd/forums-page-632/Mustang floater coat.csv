504110,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-15 14:13:00,0," I called right now. It says they are currently closed. Try calling during their regular hours.Mon-Fri 7 to 4.  The only problem is today is Tuesday and its 10 am.lol  I had a hard time surfing the site too and finding survival suits, since the suits are classified under work suits?  Doesn't look like they have anything in camo."

504116,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-15 14:31:00,0, Thanks. I had already found them under work suits. I'm looking at the ms-195 or ms-195 HD. None of them have built in boots.
