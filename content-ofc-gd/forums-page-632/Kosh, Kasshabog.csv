503272,hunterjoe84,2010-09-12 15:49:00,52,"Ive fished kosh 5 times this year now and I havent caught a single walleye. Ive tried drop shotting with live bait and gulp, Trolling, worm harnesses in all depths from 8-60 feet. Anyone have any suggestions?  I also fish this lake and I have no problem catching walleye.  27 inch"

503734,siwash,2010-09-14 09:11:00,683,many of these types of questions go unanswered especially when the questioner becomes demanding!
503783,Fish Farmer,2010-09-14 13:28:00,2234,"That lake never had Walleye in it till it was stocked, so I was told. I fished it last year and caught 3 nice Walleye near one of the Islands that had a weed bed near it. I used Chomper worms on a single blade harness, chrome blade-red beads and split shot. Real worms got chewed off by the Sunfish, Perch and Rock-bass before my harness could get to the bottom, so thats why I went with the garlic pumpkin seed Chompers worm. They have to be the best and stinkiest plastic worm on the market. Good luck next time out"
