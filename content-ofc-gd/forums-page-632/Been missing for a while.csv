Any way I have been approached by some of the kids and some parents to start up the fishing tournament for the kids in the park. Well after much thought...  (very little) some contact with my previous sponsors of course (they wanted to know what took so long) Seems the wife had already talked to them, I will again be doing the fishing derby at our park after 4 years....    SOOOOO that is what I have been up to... now it is time for me to get in some fishing in about 2 weeks from now  Thats it for now"
