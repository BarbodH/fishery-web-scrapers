501555,msp,2010-09-05 15:44:00,1336,Looks like a great season so far. I like those pig smallies....2 at a time !
501563,Rod Caster,2010-09-05 16:40:00,5784,Nice cats! I'd trade the furball terror I have for those anyday! (GF says no tho)
501572,Dave Bailey,2010-09-05 17:46:00,1641,"Well thanks for THAT info. I just did a Google image search for ""sweet beaver"" and forgot to set the filters. Lucky the wife and kids weren't in the room."
