504258,Baptiste,2010-09-16 01:45:00,37,Beautiful Wally fellow Beacher. Their are as many Beach residents as Walleye at Baptiste.
504288,jediangler,2010-09-16 03:09:00,1923,"Congrats on the beauty walleye man. We used to fish Elephant lake for years and only ever caught one there too. Don't worry about buying loads of tackle, you already know what the best lure in the world is, a jig & grub combo. Take it from a diehard jig fisherman, everything that swims will take a jig & grub. Just get some different weights and colours and you'll be set for any fishing trip."
503788,thatleetboy,2010-09-14 13:41:00,143,"Well, as you may recall, I'm really, really new to fishing, and get really, really excited by everything. Just have to share my pics from Sunday!  We drove up to Bancroft VERY early on Sunday morning, stopped by the Apsley baitstore (what time do they get up?!?) launched the boat, and headed out in a light drizzle.   My truly generous BiL surprised me with this little box of goodies as an early birthday present... (since I really have nothing else, I was tickled pink to get it!)  We caught a few pike, several smallmouth bass, but the real catch of the day was this yellow walleye! I was *so* excited to land this six-and-a-half pound beauty...   So, I finally got some more badly needed practice in cleaning fish. I've got a good teacher, so I'm getting the hang of it. We got a fire going, and Rudy cooked us up a nice shore lunch to go along with a few homemade IPA's. A nice night.      It rained Sunday night, and we didn't catch anything worth keeping Monday morning. Still, I had a great couple of days, I'm a happy camper!   Cheers"
503790,Rod Caster,2010-09-14 13:45:00,5784,that is a wonderful fish! Very bright colors. Did you catch it with any of your new tackle?
503793,Chance,2010-09-14 13:50:00,420,Congrats..you sound well on your way to a full time addiction  That area is awesome and one of my favourites.
503794,thatleetboy,2010-09-14 13:51:00,143," Yes actually, yellow grub on a jig.  My BiL said he had never seen a walleye so yellow... maybe that comes with age. I was nervous enough landing it, and he kept screaming ""OMG it's a monster!""  Lots of fun   Cheers"
503796,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-14 13:55:00,0,Great report. Sounds like fun times. Congrats on that beauty pickerel.
503797,Chance,2010-09-14 13:55:00,420,Definitely a nice fish.Diet and surroundings play a big part in colour.
503801,markiemark70,2010-09-14 14:00:00,158,"Sweet!! Nice fish, must have been a good time and a good meal too!"
503808,Joey,2010-09-14 14:17:00,9122,"That's great!  Very nice pickerel there.  We stayed for a week at Lake Baptiste and tried for pickerel and never did get one so you did very well, congrats.  Joey"
503809,kickingfrog,2010-09-14 14:21:00,8333,"Big deal, everybody catches 6.5 lb walleye out of that lake.  Nice job. Now you'll be looking for a 8 plus pounder."
503811,thatleetboy,2010-09-14 14:25:00,143,  ROTFLMAO!  I understand just how damn lucky I was!   Cheers
503983,Leecher,2010-09-15 00:02:00,7832,Very nice walleye thatleetboy Congratulations Now I'm hungry for some fish & chips.... I wonder why Great job and thanks for sharing!!! Leechman
503985,HTHM,2010-09-15 00:06:00,4082,"Well done! That is a great walleye! Soon thye bait caster questions will come, and we will know that we have a new one to add to the addicted."

504092,saneryin,2010-09-15 12:02:00,39,that is Nice!  I have never caught a walleye... heart of them many times.
504101,ccmtcanada,2010-09-15 13:18:00,7971,Congrats!  That is a SWEET walleye!!!
504136,Headhunter,2010-09-15 15:50:00,5703,Nice Pickereye!!!!! Get ready to see your bank balance drop as G.A.S. hits you! (G.A.S. = Gear Aquisition Syndrom) HH
504144,mercman,2010-09-15 16:30:00,7054,"EXCELLENT !!! from one newbie to another, don't worry about the expense. It's an investment in your future"
504177,capt bruce,2010-09-15 20:18:00,820,"Two words ""slot size"" ...   lol nice catch bet it tasted as good as it looked .. Fellow Beacher"
504184,k-max,2010-09-15 20:37:00,20,"Beauty 'eye you nailed there, I'm guess you must have been in the east part of the lake.  I have fished Baptiste 6-7 times over the years and seen nothing but pike (tons of them), bass (LM/SM), muskie (once) and panfish.  Never a Walleye, though I knew they were in there as they had been stocked in the past.  I have focused more on the central/west part of the lake, and havent hit the east end of it yet.  All in all, its a gorgeous place to spend some time out on the water even when the bite isnt on!  I personally love walking a suick jerkbait across the surface on a calm evening in dog bay over the sunken logs.  There are always agressive pike ready to ambush!"
504193,thatleetboy,2010-09-15 21:34:00,143,Thanks for all the warm words guys.  Nice place you got here!    Cheers
504198,esoxansteel,2010-09-15 22:31:00,1307,"Wheres the tasty cheeks, did not see any in the skillet, unless you ate them as sushie which is ok too"
504235,thatleetboy,2010-09-16 00:58:00,143," Apparently Rudy's daughter has a real thing for the cheeks, so he put them aside to take home for her.... there's actually less than half that fish in the pan!"
