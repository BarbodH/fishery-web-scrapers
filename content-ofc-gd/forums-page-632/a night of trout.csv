503602,scuro2,2010-09-13 23:25:00,904,Had a few hours to fish on the monday of long weekend and went to my favourite trout lake. I had a bow on within minutes (no pic) but then had some gear problems and then fished for about two hours.   A BE-U-tiful fish   Another purdy one   For some reason they seemed to be gathered within a small area   Caught this fellow probably in between 20 and 30 ft.     ...and finally my second bow. Had a monster hit as I was coming in. I had no light so I couldn't go back fer her. Next time.
503603,BillM,2010-09-13 23:39:00,17367,So I'm guessing browns for the first two pics?
503609,bare foot wader,2010-09-13 23:48:00,1354,those first two pics don't look like any bow I've caught....guessing a laker brown or landlocked atlantic maybe...beauty fish either way
503611,scuro2,2010-09-13 23:55:00,904,Couldn't get a pic of the first bow...next three are browns.
503703,highdrifter,2010-09-14 03:08:00,2534,BEAUTS.  First three are all browns by the looks of it.  That strain of browns reminds me of the ones you find in old scottish locks..  Thanks for the report!  cheers HD
503719,scuro2,2010-09-14 04:06:00,904,I'm new to any type of trout fishing that isn't laker fishing. Gotta say I love these pictures.
503721,Guest 2UNIQ,2010-09-14 04:15:00,0,I'm more impressed by your rock bass... she looks huge when compared to your thigh.
