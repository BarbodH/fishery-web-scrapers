411449,limeyangler,2009-12-13 04:27:00,5204,"Hi All,  Just wondering if anyone else heard of this.  WFN was asking people to sign up to it a while ago. basically you write in to say why you think you would be a good 'Ambassador' for your region, and that they would look at all applications and respond in 30 days.  I applied....got an email confirmation saying they would reply in 30 days ( on 25th october)  30 days came and went, I emailed them a week after politely asking if there was any news......another 2 weeks have gone by and no reply to that.  I was really keen and understand fully that i might not make the grade, but the lack of response just made me wonder if anyone else had applied or heard back...lol...anyone?"
411470,danbouck,2009-12-13 06:19:00,4380,I have recently been accepted.  Now... what to write about???
411475,bigfish1965,2009-12-13 07:02:00,3382,I got no reply at all

411564,MuskiesnLakers,2009-12-13 16:39:00,6,"I was also accepted.  Been a while since I have been here.  I've done a bit of lurking over the last few days, but haven't responded to anything.  Going to have a more steady access to the internet from here on in, I think.  Esp. after Feb.  Hope all are doing well  MnL"

412902,Cynosure,2009-12-17 17:41:00,2,"I just sent you an email.  There must have been a mix up with the database - your submission looks fine.  You just need to create an account  GBW - please send an email to [emailÂ protected] and I will look into it.  There is an issue where if some users have an old account in the online shop then they can't create an Ambassador account.  It's a simple fix, but I need to know your email address."
