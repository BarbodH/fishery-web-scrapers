504247,Joey,2010-09-16 01:33:00,9122,"So I went to my mom's to watch survivor tonight, and she had this thing on a paper towel, about an inch and a half long.  She asked me what I thought it was and I said it looked like a frog.  I asked her where she found it, and she said it was in her loose herbal green tea  Needless to say, she was not impressed.  Here it is:      Had to share  Joey"

504252,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-16 01:40:00,0,at least it wasn't one of them psychedelic toads!
504254,Roy,2010-09-16 01:42:00,13728,Poor Mom. That's why I really like herbal and organic stuff...it'd sooooooooo good for ya! Disgusting. And what the heck were you doing at Mom's on a Wednesday night?
504255,kickingfrog,2010-09-16 01:43:00,8333,All natural is not all good.
504256,Ben_Daniels,2010-09-16 01:44:00,435,Don't you mean to bad it wasn't?
504262,Joey,2010-09-16 01:49:00,9122," They changed Survivor to Wednedsay night hon  We're not too happy about breaking tradition like this, not one little bit"
504263,moparhawk,2010-09-16 01:54:00,146,Survivor is awesome. Cant believe how Jimmy Johnson aged 20 yrs overnight!
504264,Joey,2010-09-16 01:58:00,9122, Ya really.  Did you know he tried out for a prior Survivor and did not pass the physical.  They told him he was days away from a heart attack.  So he changed his diet and took care of himself and passed this test.  He said that Survivor saved his life.
504339,Sis,2010-09-16 13:18:00,24,"think I'd be switching to tea bags after that lol. I'll start watching Survivor when they have it in Northwestern Ontario during mosquito season, or in the dead of winter."
504359,Tarzan's Jane,2010-09-16 13:56:00,1183,"That is disgusting...reminds me of a time that I was heating up a frozen lunch here at work, I think made by Michelinas....a woman was watching me and proceeded to tell me about a friend of hers who found the head of a snake.  I no longer eat stuff like that.  As for Survivor - absolutely love that show my all time favourite contestant >Rupert<"
