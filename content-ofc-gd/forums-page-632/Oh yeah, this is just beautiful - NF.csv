Riiiight... Mr. Pot, meet Mr. Kettle. How's that Stanley Cup plan coming along Richard?"

Especially when it comes to the NFL where all the revenue is split even. It is a win, win situation for the provinces and the tax payers AND the fans.  http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/capress/100914/national/hkn_nordiques_arena  Would you support Ontario's premier for investing all(prefered) if not a portion?  I don't think the gov should give money away. They should own shares and that even if the sports facility is not for all the public? The profits generated from it would be beneficial for the entire public."
