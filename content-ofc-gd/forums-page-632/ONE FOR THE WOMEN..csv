He wanted her to see what he went  through so he prayed:  'Dear Lord:  I go to work every day and put  in 8 hours while my wife  merely stays at home.  I want her to know what  I go through.  So, please allow her body to  switch with mine for a day.'  God, in his infinite wisdom,  granted the man's wish.  The next morning, sure enough,  the man awoke as a woman...  He arose, cooked breakfast  for his mate,  Awakened the kids,   Set out their school clothes,  Fed them breakfast,  Packed their lunches,  Drove them to school,  Came home and picked  up the dry cleaning,  Took it to the cleaners  And stopped at the bank  to make a deposit,  Went grocery shopping,  Then drove home to put  away the groceries,  Paid the bills and balanced  the check book.  He cleaned the cat's litter box  and bathed the dog..  Then, it was already 1 P.M.  And he hurried to make the beds,  Do the laundry, vacuum,  Dust, And sweep and mop  the kitchen floor.  Ran to the school to pick up  the kids and got into an argument  with them on the way home.  Set out milk and cookies and  got the kids organized to do  their homework.  Then, set up the ironing board  and watched TV while he  did the ironing.  At 4:30 he began peeling  potatoes and washing  vegetables for salad,  breaded the pork chops  and snapped  fresh beans for supper.  After supper,  He cleaned the kitchen,  Ran the dishwasher,  Folded laundry,  Bathed the kids, And put  them to bed.  At 9 P.M. He was exhausted  and, though his daily chores  weren't finished, he went to  bed where he was expected to  make love, which he managed  to get through without complaint.  The next morning, he awoke  and immediately knelt by the  bed and said: -  Lord, I don't know what  I was thinking.  I was so wrong to envy my  wife's being able to stay  home all day.  Please, Oh! Please,  let us trade back...Amen!' The Lord, in his infinite wisdom, replied:  'My son, I feel you have  learned your lesson and  I will be happy to change  things back to the way  they were.  You'll just have to wait  nine months, though.  You got pregnant last night.'"
