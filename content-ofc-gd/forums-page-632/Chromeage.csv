502364,bare foot wader,2010-09-08 15:39:00,1354," I was thinking the same thing, very white mouth on that guy....without a close up was looking like a steelie to me..."
502396,highdrifter,2010-09-08 17:42:00,2534, I know eh! Ain't you on the coast though?! I mean... the waters out there bud.  I would loose my freaking mind!
502402,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-08 18:12:00,0,Great report!! Man I miss fishing the rivers and streams.....
502528,Leecher,2010-09-09 02:06:00,7832,Great report and pics Fidel & co Beauty chrome for sure Thanks for sharing Leechman
503785,mepps,2010-09-14 13:30:00,1301," There plenty of good water, but the fish arent as big as Ontario! (unless we're counting sharks that is)"
503824,MJL,2010-09-14 14:58:00,2427,Chromeage indeed!  Me likey
501642,highdrifter,2010-09-06 00:20:00,2534,"Hey gang,  Was cruising with a good pal yesterday trying to find some saturday night action..  We ended hooking up with some other TRCA buds for a poker game and a morning of chinny slayin!   First fish of the day and my only fish was a bright bullet that smacked a rusty rat on a swing..  What a dime!!     Mark got into the action too.  His better fish and a nice and fresh one at that.       Rob was the one with the magic drift...  I lost count of how many fish this crazy bugger layed into.  By the by, all fish were legit.  Whether or not they were actually hitting our flies is subject to debate, but none were flossed.       Bring on the steeeeeel.  cheers HD"
501646,Joey,2010-09-06 00:33:00,9122,Sweeeeeeet!!  Nice chromers.  Looks like you're literally in someones backyard  Joey
501647,alphaalpha,2010-09-06 00:33:00,475,nice fish! good work and thanks for the report.
501650,bongo,2010-09-06 00:38:00,67,"Nice going guys, good work. I hooked into a few chrome chinnies back 2 weeks ago, man are they ever scrappy, really fun to catch them."
501651,highdrifter,2010-09-06 00:38:00,2534, LOL.  Was afraid of that!!  Thanks sug.
501652,Joey,2010-09-06 00:42:00,9122," Hey, I think its great hon, your not ""in"" someone's back yard.  To be able to fish in the city like that is great!  I wish I had a river like that near me, I'd be there all the time"
501653,spincast,2010-09-06 00:44:00,3279,nice fish -   and tanks for sharing. Any of those houses got a for sale sign?
501655,highdrifter,2010-09-06 00:45:00,2534, true dat.  Look honey..  there's a ravine in the back yard!!
501659,highdrifter,2010-09-06 00:54:00,2534, Thanks Brah!
501660,highdrifter,2010-09-06 00:55:00,2534, MuHAH!!  Prolly..
501662,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-06 01:19:00,0,"nice fish... but shouldn't it be of the ""Onchorynchus"" kind?"
501666,Cudz,2010-09-06 01:27:00,2652,Your buddy plays a mean salmon guitar. That ragweed in the pictures is making my eyes watery and very itchy. Nice fish
501667,highdrifter,2010-09-06 01:27:00,2534, Ya know I was sure it was a mykiss when she breached because you could see a pink hue...  but it turned out to be a tshawytscha instead!
501672,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-06 01:56:00,0, Wishful thinking perhaps eh?  I can't wait.
501683,daryl0815,2010-09-06 03:33:00,225,"Nice fish, that one you got is pure chrome, I havent got one like that yet this year!"
501755,solopaddler,2010-09-06 14:31:00,8605,"Well done!  We got into a whackload yesterday as well.(Currently icing down my right arm. ). Not overly chromy, but man they're a lot of fun to catch.  We'll have to get together for some serious chromage later this fall.   "
501771,highdrifter,2010-09-06 15:31:00,2534, It's already shaping up to be wicked year for steel.  We'll be in touch!
501836,msp,2010-09-06 19:22:00,1336,Some real ugly mugs there folks...... I'm not talkin bout the salmon either. Tell Rob he's a dirty Finn that smells like rotton roe !
501838,Spiel,2010-09-06 19:28:00,9065,"Looks like a great day out guys but I'm skeptical that this fish is a Chinook.    Without a better picture I'm guessing Atlantic or perhaps an early run Coho, thoughts?"
501864,highdrifter,2010-09-06 21:07:00,2534, HAHAHAH!!  He'll like that one.  I thought it was more like 2 week old brie left behind the furnace..
501883,highdrifter,2010-09-06 21:46:00,2534," Oh crap not again!  I'll dig up another shot of this fish that gives it a better profile.  Figured between the four of us we had a pretty good idea of what it was.  Definetly not an atlantic.  In this case the leading ray on the anal fin only went a third of the length of the fin.  The ray on cohos extends two thirds of the fin and the atlantic's runs the full length..  Without a close-up of the anal fin it's almost impossible for a positive ID, but it just didn't have the profile of a salar.  This link helped big time.  Might be a good idea to add it to the list of OFC links for others to use also.  atlantic or chinook"
501903,BillM,2010-09-06 22:31:00,17367,So what colour marshmellows were working for you guys?   Steel season is almost here!!!
501907,highdrifter,2010-09-06 22:42:00,2534, Itty bitty ones Bill..  Yellow sponge and red ear plugs!!
502355,ehg,2010-09-08 14:58:00,2666,Nice going Fidel Amazing that a river salmon thread didn't get locked. Congrats on that as well
502360,mepps,2010-09-08 15:27:00,1301,"Damn son, you couldnt have found any like this when we fished together???"
