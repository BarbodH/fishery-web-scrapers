503693,zeeter,2010-09-14 02:25:00,92,"Used to have one of these.  It's  cable system steering.  Meaning you tilt your foot on it forwards and backwards and that rotates the head of the trolling motor, thus charging it's direction.  The grey rectangular button is for acceleration.  Pressing it makes the propeller go.  The red switch changes the motor from continuous acceleration to non-continuous modes.  Continuous mode is only good for lengthy trolling.  Make sure you buy a 40 amp breaker.  Sometimes these models can overheat.  Hope that helps !"

503695,fishnsled,2010-09-14 02:30:00,3520,"   The grey dial on the left is your speed selection. 1 is slow, 5 is fast.  The switch below has 3 positions.  Up Â© is constant - motor keeps running.  Middle (T) is tap or touch for on (The grey button on the right of the pedal).  And the rabbit setting (down switch) will kick the motor into high speed (5) when you tap the switch on the right no matter what speed is selected on the dial.  Hope that helps.   And what Zeeter said."
