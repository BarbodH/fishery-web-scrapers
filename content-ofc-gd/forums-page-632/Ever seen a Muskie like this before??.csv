503440,muskymatt,2010-09-13 02:45:00,2608,  Healthy fish....didn't seem to be bothered much by having no or very little upper jaw.  M.
503445,Joey,2010-09-13 02:54:00,9122,You gonna show us the whole fish or just that part  Maybe he lost his snout when he was younger and it has healed over now?  Joey
503447,Dave Bailey,2010-09-13 02:59:00,1641,"Obviously enough genetic mutation to affect development, but not enough to weed it out of the gene pool. Interesting."
503448,muskymatt,2010-09-13 03:01:00,2608,"OK...    Nice 40ish Ottawa river fish, fought good...I have actually seen this once before but can't recall where at this time.  It had no scar tissue so I think it is a birth defect.  I would think an injury would have signs of rips and tears but this one didn't.  Pretty cool that despite this ailment it was so healthy."
503450,Pigeontroller,2010-09-13 03:13:00,2793,"Matt, Mike M. won the Hamilton Outing with a similar fish."
503451,muskymatt,2010-09-13 03:14:00,2608, Boy that fish travelled a long way...LOL  There's the connection....I wonder if there is a name for this affliction!  And not rudolf the snub nosed muskie
503453,spinnerbaitking,2010-09-13 03:37:00,1622,Nice Fish even with a screwed up lip Richard
503460,Guest 2uniq,2010-09-13 04:55:00,0,It's just a muskie with its upper jaw torn off probably when he was young... you can see the injuries healed up nicely. That fish is lucky to be alive and not die because of infection risks.
503463,lew,2010-09-13 08:31:00,12766,"I got one on Upper Buck a couple years back that was also missing her upper jaw Matt,just like yours, and she also appeared to be very healthy."
503467,glen,2010-09-13 10:04:00,2641,Someone is setting the hook too hard.
503468,Roy,2010-09-13 10:09:00,13728,Looks like he's been chasing parked boats.
503469,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-13 10:57:00,0,Haven't seen a musky like that but plenty of pike and bass.
503494,TJQ,2010-09-13 13:01:00,7806,Thats pretty neat!
503515,fishermccann,2010-09-13 15:22:00,655,Ditto on the Bass.
503518,Bondar,2010-09-13 15:31:00,817,haha thats the muskie thats been biting peoples trolling motors !!!!
503553,aplumma,2010-09-13 19:09:00,6896,That is one of my most recent genetic escapees it is a cross between a musky and a bulldog. I am also developing a mule/onion mix it is going to be a nice a@@ that will bring tears to your eyes.   Art
503666,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-14 01:13:00,932,I see lots of bass like that as well.  Nice Musky either way - looks plenty healthy from where I'm sitting.
503786,Chance,2010-09-14 13:32:00,420,Have you tried the Bulldog/Schitzu cross yet Art...One of my favourite movie lines
503975,Leecher,2010-09-14 23:53:00,7832,Stiff upper lip for sure Aside from that.... she's a beaut Leechman
504009,Dozer,2010-09-15 01:15:00,896,Thats a dirty under bite.
