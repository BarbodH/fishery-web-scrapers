140250,FishFinder,2007-12-07 01:04:00,481,Just wondering if anyone has a link to MNR lake trout stocking. Having trouble googling it.  Thanks in advance Your friend  SkelzWoods
140251,fishindevil,2007-12-07 01:11:00,6254,"Well first you should contact the MNR in the region where you want to fish and ask for that list,i have done this several times before and have got the lists,i dont think its online but i could be wrong,or ask to speak with the officer who is in charge of that area as they have first hand knowledge where what,kind of fish was stocked where and how many ????.....hope this helps...good-luck"

140257,FishFinder,2007-12-07 01:23:00,481,"Thanks for the links wayne, i found those but looks like way too much un necessary information for my old eyes to sift through. I was looking more for charts with names of lakes and stocking numbers. I guess maybe it wasnt meant to be. Thanks though for the help Fishin'Devil(Shawn) and Irishfield(Wayne)  Cheers  Skelzwoods"

140261,FishFinder,2007-12-07 01:32:00,481,Your a good man wayne!
140264,irishfield,2007-12-07 01:42:00,26272,"I have the entire list of lakes in the Temagami area that are stocked... but of course it's pinned up beside my 9 x 50,000 charts on the hall wall in the cottage... so I can look at which one I'm headed for next.  I'll keep pokin around. Nothing else to do with the wife in TO."
140267,irishfield,2007-12-07 01:44:00,26272,"Go here  http://www.temagamistewardship.ca/  and double click on archives. Tabs on ""book"" cover stocking in Temagami area lakes."

140269,irishfield,2007-12-07 01:56:00,26272,"And here is where a lot of the new 2008 regs came from for Lake Trout.  Note they still use the wordage ""BAG LIMIT"" in the document.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/fishing/fmz/p...out_toolkit.pdf"
140273,FishFinder,2007-12-07 02:23:00,481,"Good Stuff Irishfield, I will look through all the info on my break. My boss is killing me today.  Cheers  Skelzwoods"
140275,huntervasili,2007-12-07 02:33:00,1604,Those are probably the best links on the web Wayne... thats how I have figured the lakes I am planning on fishing this year
503683,David,2010-09-14 01:59:00,1," Any chance you saved a copy of this pdf Irishfield? ,I had clicked on it and the MNR has changed their web site.... ........and the new site [search engine] is a little frustrating"
503900,Homer Is King,2010-09-14 19:58:00,305,The Ontario Stewardship Council website has lots of info. Go to this site and find the council for the area your interested in. They often have stocking information:  http://www.ontariostewardship.org/index.php/local_council  Here's an example from the Bancroft area Stewardship Council website http://www.ontariostewardship.org/councils/bancroft/files/2009_BASC_Bancroft_Mazinaw_Stocking_List.pdf
503905,dave524,2010-09-14 20:26:00,4508,"While researching the stocking of brown trout in a river in Haliburton that I was very familiar with I found this:  http://home.cogeco.ca/~sparkysfishin/Stock%20Lists/Minden%20Haliburton2008.pdf  very interesting as it names specific lakes and since it is 2008 data maybe this would be a good winter of even next spring to do a little exploring.   Maybe this guy Sparky has other lists, looks like official MNR documents with better detail than total numbers for a district."
