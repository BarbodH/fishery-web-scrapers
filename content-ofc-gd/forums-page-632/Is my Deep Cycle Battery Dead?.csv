503680,baironhorse,2010-09-14 01:35:00,145,Tried to charge me Deep cycle battery and does not hold charge....Worked ok before and it seems all of a suden...Did a Hydrometer gravity check and these are my results from left to right cell: Cell #1- 1.250 #2 - 1.100 #3 - 1.250 #4-1.275 $5-1.250 #6- 1.270 Now this was after a charge and removal of surface charge....Seems to me cell #2 is dead...is there any way I can revive this battery? If I were to use a good 15amp charger like CT Nautis one will this help...I want to make it till end of season and avoid having a new battery sit around all winter (charging it of course)....your thoughts?

503954,chong,2010-09-14 23:19:00,102,"you should go to a battery specialist to have it checked.I had the same problem with my optima red top,charged it for 3 days and still wouldn't hold the charge brought it in had them check it and now the battery is ok."

504271,chong,2010-09-16 02:18:00,102," What's the brand of the battery?Look for the distributor. You'll have to find a place yourself,I'm from Montreal.The place charged me 10$."

504296,vinnimon,2010-09-16 03:54:00,2593,"They are all done!esp #2 cell! Each cell should have 2.1 volts max ,in tip top shape!"
504473,Billy Bob,2010-09-16 21:09:00,5865," Yep, I agree......add up your cells and they come to 7.395 volts....NOT good for a 12 volt battery."
504478,chong,2010-09-16 21:29:00,102,"I would get a new battery,not worth the hassle for a $100 if it was an Optima yes."
