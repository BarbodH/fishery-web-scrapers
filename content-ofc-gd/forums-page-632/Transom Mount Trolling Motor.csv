Aside from getting a used 9.9 some time next spring I need a trolling motor too.  Any reviews on the Motor Guide Varimax trolling motors? Will get either a 40 or 45lb thrust most likely but they look pretty nice.  Any suggestions?  Thanks, MTBF"

The handle extends as well as pivots, and is going to be a whole lot better in the weeds with the weedless wedge prop that it comes with.  Battery life is awesome too especially with the Maximizer feature that is incorporated in the motor. Here is a link to the Traxxis motor......http://www.minnkotamotors.com/products/trolling_motors/freshwater_transom_mount/traxxis.aspx"
