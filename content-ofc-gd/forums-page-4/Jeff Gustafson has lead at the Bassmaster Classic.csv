This system has four species of Bass...Smallies, Largies, Spotted, and ""Meanmouth"" (a Smallie/Spot cross). Gussy's strategy of fishing deep for the smaller species, but potentially more of them, paid off in the end. That's what made this tourney so interesting."

He got lucky he had a really good bag on day 2. when he won in 2021 he actually was able to head to weigh in at 11am on the final day to make sure his fish all stayed alive and that he could take the 100k run back to weigh in easy."

""I've been 'moping' smallies for years and didn't even know it  "" Same here...vertically jigging for suspended fish is certainly not revolutionary. In fishing, there is never really anything "" new"", other than the label they put on it. I've always been a big fan of the Z-Man finnesse stuff...I even bought the hat...lol   "

1084424,smitty55,2023-03-29 02:08:00,928,Down south they call it a Damiki rig. Ive also heard Jeff call it hanging a minnow. Basically you just hang the bait under the boat above the fish you find on sonar instead of using a float. Doesn't get much more basic. https://www.wired2fish.com/fishing-tips/how-to-fish-the-damiki-rig-beginner-to-advanced 
1084425,AKRISONER,2023-03-29 10:51:00,5558,"Funny you mention that, but honestly In 20 years Id just drive a bit slower! Going 40mph over white caps is actually totally smooth in a bass boat while the aluminums tend to beat the heck out of you!  I find in average boating conditions, glass boats when you get them on pad are a way easier ride. You just skip along and don‚Äôt feel much of anything."

1084363,CrowMan,2023-03-26 14:00:00,413,I always find it interesting that Gussy is one of the few on the tour that runs an aluminum boat in a sea of glass..

1084373,CrowMan,2023-03-27 03:23:00,413,"I don't know about rougher, but definitely slower. That Lund Pro-V hull nearly cost him the win...when Gussy got to his first spot this morning, Benton had already been there for 10 minutes...and promptly landed a 4 lb. Smallie as Gussy left in search of other water. Benton's more hydrodynamic glass hull was that much faster over the 45+ minute run from the launch.. Anyway, it didnt matter in the end, and he hung on for a¬†historic win !!"

But it was pretty calm yesterday, so that‚Äôs a lot less noticeable. it moreso is that his top end isn‚Äôt close to the glass rigs. guys run whatever boat they get the best deal to get into. Gussy and lunds relationship makes total sense given his locale. Zaldain was a skeeter yamaha guy for a decade and is now with bass pro/nitro/mercury.  there is no actual loyalty, the guys are trying to make a living the best they can."
1084377,Terry,2023-03-27 13:43:00,14456,"Yes he has been sponsored by Lund for a very long time and I have heard he has been offered big sponsorship from the big bass boat manufacturers but so far has turned them down to be loyal to Lund I admire that, but he may need to reconsider"

1084381,AKRISONER,2023-03-27 16:09:00,5558,"watching the wired to fish video its from 2020 and you can see how even since then his sponsorship money has increased after he won on tellico in 2021. Intriguing, in that first video you can tell Jeff rigged his own boat and was using what was considered top of the line for the various applications rather than dealing with specific brands. One critique I have always had of the Lund Pro V's is that they are a little akward at the very nose of the boat and dont make for an ideal electronics set up. You dont really get to see it in that video because its clear he was down in florida pre-fishing for the first event of the year and he was still running the factory electronics! It will be very interesting to see what happens with Gussy next season, I could see some major sponsorship changes coming up for him, Everyone is going to be wanting a piece of the hot commodity. Your going to see his face on the bags of z man plastics going forward I am sure of that. Considering Jeff is the only guy running a Lund on the entire Elite Series, they bloody hit the jackpot with this win, Im thinking his deal is going to be a whole heck of a lot sweeter next season because you know Nitro is going to be knocking at his door. Im thinking Jeff might struggle a little over the next few elite events, his mind is going to be all over the place trying to manage his new found infamy. Couldnt happen to a better guy though!"
1084385,woodenboater,2023-03-27 19:24:00,2277,"I didn't watch it online but do we know for sure he was running aluminum and not the GL Pro V ? Seems like a golden opportunity for Lund to capitalize on this win. Also wonder if this will make people rethink aluminum vs glass for these tourneys., but guess it depends on the waters and weather."
1084386,Rattletrap2,2023-03-27 19:29:00,1652,"I am by no means anywhere near this class of Fisherman, but I owned one glass boat and now aluminum again. For what I do, I have no desire to go back to glass. It will be interesting to see what Jeff‚Äôs future brings! He absolutely will have his choice to fish out of whatever he wants. Such an awesome representative of Canada and Ontario on the Professional circuit!"

The only time I feel like aluminum is better is for 2 weeks each year in the fall when it‚Äôs snowing and blowing and downright miserable. Any other time id rather be in my glasser. funny everyone always talks about the big water capabilities of aluminum deep v‚Äôs over glass but the right glass hull to me feels better hitting waves Vs the aluminum. I think the only time it gets really bad is when waves are 6+ feet, but even then who truthfully isn‚Äôt quartering and running the troughs anyways when stuff gets that huge. Let‚Äôs also get serious here‚Ä¶once you drive a boat 65+mph, you don‚Äôt ever want to let that go üòÇ"

1084389,CrowMan,2023-03-27 19:59:00,413,"He was definitely in an aluminum Pro-V. At the end of the day, these tournaments are about marketing...it's the sponsors (ie. manufacturers) that pay the bills and keep everyone ""employed"". And marketing is all about branding. Gussy's brand is the ""northern angler""....hence, the tin boat, finnesse presentations on spinning gear more often than not...right down to the plaid Kenora Dinner Jacket. There are plenty of good ol' boys from Texas, Alabama and the Carolinas on the tour...power fishing with baitcasters in metal-flake glass rockets. That leaves Jeff (and a few others) with a certain subset of sponsors that tend to specialize in "" north country "" gear to himself...Lund, Northland Tackle etc.. so he doesn't have to directly compete for those sponsorship $$$ from the majority of guys that are mostly south of the Mason-Dixon Line. So far that branding strategy has served him well. However, now that he has reached an altitude where he's at the pinnacle of the sport...that very well may change. We'll see what the future brings.   "
