Great to get out but waste of money for this show. Another Cancel for next year, No Pure Fishing, Shimano, or other people"

I thought it was nice seeing the hunting stuff at a sportsman show. We definitely did stop and talk to a couple independent guys trying to make a name for themselves.  I always enjoy watching some of the dog shows and the show had some good speakers.  All in all a win for my wife and 12 year old son, guess it always depends what your looking for.Â  I've never been to the Fishing/boat show but I would imagine that's more Fishing related then the sportsman show is.  Was definitely nice getting out.Â  I'm sure the show will keep rebuildingÂ  not even sure if it was on last year. "

A shadow of what it was 20 yrs ago.Â  	Iâ€™m guessing the equally weak Spring Fishing Show in Feb at the same venue has something to do with it.Â  	Or that most outdoor activities are on the downturn -except Pickleball ðŸ˜³ Any other thoughts?
