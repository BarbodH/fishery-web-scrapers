1084280,JillianParks,2023-03-20 01:56:00,1,"Hey there! No worries about updating an old thread. It happens all the time. As for reliable latex gloves, I recently tried DuraSkin gloves. I've been wearing the same pair for about two weeks, and they still look like new. So, give them a shot. I got them on HarmonyCR (https://harmonycr.com/latex-gloves/) . BTW, I'm new here so pardon any rookie mistakes. Stoked to be part of the community and learn from you all!"
1084303,Reelpro,2023-03-22 02:43:00,73,Mechanix Gloves I have a no name brand of them that are perfect for baitcasters.
1034419,Dan668,2018-09-25 17:01:00,1120,"Its that time of year where I start to cast for musky. Looking to see if anyone has found a good pair of gloves that allows you to cast without issue. This post pretty much comes up each year. Ive read on a few forums where people recommend Kast Steelhead gloves, but im not sure if they are available in Canada, and on their main site for the past year or two, they havent had any larger sizing so i am not sure whats going on with them. I seen on orvis' website they have the glove but again have to ship from stateside and guess my size. Currently ive just been using basic little black cotton gloves and bringing a dozen of them lol, just swap them out when they get too wet. And sometimes slip a handwarmer in. It gets me by."
1034430,jimmer,2018-09-25 20:20:00,2730,Have you thought of putting latex gloves under the cotton ones?
1034435,GBW,2018-09-25 22:12:00,8460,I cut the finger tips off an old set of mountain biking gloves and so far so good.
1034436,mitch seguin,2018-09-25 22:47:00,98,No one that I have spoken to who used the Kast gloves liked them.  I use the extream Simms gloves on windy days or a pair of thick lined fingerless rag wool gloves on calm days.
1034441,dave524,2018-09-26 00:32:00,4508,"The best winter steelheading gloves I ever had were hand knit by a friend's mom years ago,  Only the tip of the thumb , index finger and middle finger were exposed, the ring finger and pinkie were full fingers.  I both fished spin tackle and float reel with them no problem, she did a few pairs for guys, unfortunately moths got to mine after many seasons of use."
1034442,Dan668,2018-09-26 00:44:00,1120,"I have thought of that, just havent tried it yet. Im sure it would help greatly."
1034444,Dan668,2018-09-26 00:47:00,1120,"I actually have a pair of fingerless rag wool gloves that have a fold over mitt portion. They are warm, but the thumb has no hole. Ive been thinking of altering it also."
1034446,chris.brock,2018-09-26 01:11:00,4053,"I've tried neoprene gloves and my hands felt colder than being bare. I use decent quality, slim fitting fleece gloves and consciously try to keep them dry. I use a bait caster and the gloves don't hinder me much."
1034456,DanD,2018-09-26 10:18:00,2223,Spray your cotton gloves with silicone. Not saying to use the stuff in the vid; just an example of what a high quality silicone can do.  Dan
1034458,Garnet,2018-09-26 12:57:00,2056,By far the best glove are the white work glove from Marks with the green wrist bans. 12  pair  for $7. You have good dexterity with 1 pair and when cold just put 2nd pair on. And at .50 a pair they double as toilet paper.
1034459,porkpie,2018-09-26 13:00:00,2521,"I buy fingerless gloves at the dollar shop.  They work great for steelhead and I'll fish all winter long if the water is open, and it's not outrageously cold.  Cheap and effective!"

1034473,Terry,2018-09-26 17:24:00,14456,"I sweat so badly in latex gloves, i cant wear them fishing  my hands get so wet they get cold and hours in sweaty gloves stink too"
1034474,jimmer,2018-09-26 17:41:00,2730,You do have to get ones that fit properly.
1034475,jimmer,2018-09-26 17:43:00,2730,Must be hot flashes.....lol. You might have a point.
1034477,limeyangler,2018-09-26 18:15:00,5204,THEY FIT PERFECTLY!   
1034483,AKRISONER,2018-09-27 00:13:00,5558,i have rynauds syndrome...kast steelhead gloves with a hot pack is the only thing that gets me through the fall and winter...without em i literally wouldnt be able to fish. I own 2 pairs for when one inevitably gets damp after a long day of fishing. Your hands will stay dry but the gloves do become saturated much like a gortex jacket. They are the best things that I have found on the market.
1034495,Garnet,2018-09-27 14:15:00,2056,Lots of guys take aspirin 81 helps slippery the blood. I take full strength aspirin because of general pain and keep the hands warm.
1034505,Dan668,2018-09-27 17:36:00,1120,"Sweet, thats what most have told me. Not perfect but good. I may try a pair. I seen on their instagram that they are releasing a new pair, probably the reason why theirs no sizing on their website."

Im excited to see the new design as well, apparently one thing they have added is a touchscreen finger which is awesome. I could see myself picking up a pair for sure."
1034518,BillM,2018-09-28 13:12:00,17367,"Yup, wasn't a fan of them at all.   They touted them as gloves you could actually leave on while steelheading (lol not even close) "
1034520,cuzza,2018-09-28 15:09:00,467,"I have a pair of Simms Skeena neoprene gloves which would keep your hands dry, looks like they've replaced them with the Kispiox. I can fly fish with them and even tie knots, I just waste more tippet as it's like tying them with super-fat fingers! The only thing that doesn't work is palming a reel as they're too ""grippy"""
1034534,Snidley,2018-09-29 05:48:00,620,If you watch west coast fishing shows you will see most westcoast anglers wear the full  blue latex gloves shown above. They do it for warmth and also to keep their human smell off the bait or lures they are using. I used to use Marmot fingerless climbing gloves. They were great because they were dureable and felt dry even when wet. I checked their website and it appears they are no longer made. I like the silicone treatment on fleese gloves as getting waterlogged has always been the issue with them. For sun protection in summer I cut the fingers out of a pair of white cotton work gloves. Keeps the sun off my hands and it's no big deal when you get a hook caught in the material. I ruined several pairs of expensive sungloves by doing just that and  they did not do a better job blocking sunlight. The dollar store also has green cotton gloves with a rough latex palm that is great at holding the shape integrity of the gloves. I never used them for fishing but they were great for weight training  including blister producing rope workouts
