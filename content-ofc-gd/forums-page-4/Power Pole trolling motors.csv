1084329,captpierre,2023-03-23 20:54:00,2521,What’s the word on these.  	I hear around $7k https://power-pole.com/trolling-motors/learn-more   
1084335,Fisherman,2023-03-23 23:51:00,7201,"Jeez for that price you could have a trolling monkey to pilot the boat.   If you wonder what a trolling monkey is, is related to a trunk monkey."
1084336,CrowMan,2023-03-24 00:24:00,413,"I don't have any first hand knowledge of this brand (all I know is their anchoring gear)...but when it comes to electric motors, ECM (brushless) is definitely the way to go. ECM's are better in almost every way except initial cost. Lowrance and Garmin both also offer brushless/ECM trolling motors, with the advantage of being able to seamlessly combine it with their respective sonar/scanning/GPS systems. Don't think Power Pole is in the ""fish finder"" business as far as I know..  "
1084339,porkpie,2023-03-24 11:02:00,2521,"7k?  I’m sure it’s a quality item, but to me anything over 3 grand is getting silly for a bow mount."
1084505,David Chong,2023-04-03 13:00:00,836,Looking forward to having one of these on my boat this year! Anyone who has had any dealings with Power Pole knows what a quality compnay that they are! I expect this to be the best trolling motor on the market!
