1084443,Terry,2023-03-30 18:10:00,14456,"There is a wire from the oil reservoir that goes to an alarm, that should warn you it who knows if it still works on a 27 year old motor when mine quit working and I replaced it with another used reservoir , I tested it by adding oil to the gas tank , marked the level of the oil in the reservoir and saw the level was going down each time I ran the motor. So I quit adding oil to the gas tank and ran with just the reservoir ran fine till I sold it"
1084446,glen,2023-03-30 20:39:00,2641,Ok so an alarm if low oil in reservoir but may not be pumping oil.   	Plus Age of engine is saying to premix. Any known issues with these engines? Thanks Terry. 
1084447,CrowMan,2023-03-30 23:41:00,413,"""Any known issues with these engines?"" 3 cylinder 2-stoke Merc's have a history of the top cylinder not getting enough cooling, and therefore the head cracking around the sparkplug. I blew one up myself back in the early '90's."

1084460,glen,2023-03-31 19:10:00,2641,Ok thanks everyone.
1084471,DanD,2023-04-01 13:19:00,2223,"A few years ago I was looking at buying a 19 foot Starcraft with a 150 Merc on it that the oil injection gear had stripped out. With a bit of research I found an electronic retro fit for the injection system. It consisted of a few sensors, control module, and electric pump. Everything else needed was scavenged from the original injection system. The deal fell through so I diidn't go any further with this retro fit system. But if you find that this engine's oiling system has failed it would be another fix? Sorry I don't remember what it was called but at the time it was an easy find while I was looking/googling fix options. Dan."
