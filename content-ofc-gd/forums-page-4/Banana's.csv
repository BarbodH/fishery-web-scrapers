Just on sleds to backwoods lakes and no hut. He isn't doing well, I'm not doing great but not bad. You think the skunk is touching without even a boat? Should I say something to him?  Thanks in advance for any suggestions"
1084209,Fisherman,2023-03-14 03:04:00,7201,"Hahaha, I think it's an old wives tale that goes something like this.Â  Way back when merchant ship were ferrying banana's, they ended up bringing spiders along and unfortunately some sailors were bit and either suffered or died.Â  That's why the taboo of banana's on board.Â  If I no mistaken, I swear I remember seeing banana fish attractant for sale."

1084231,Dara,2023-03-14 23:04:00,3052,"Yup, that would be amazing on a hot summer day..with a touch of wind for the rollers"
1084232,Dano,2023-03-14 23:42:00,719,Not sure about that. On one northern trip we took a few bananas with our lunches and the pike bite was pretty hot so we tossed ribbons of the peel on hooks and landed more than a few on those peels lol.

My advice:Â  if you want bananas, eat them don't drink them. Doug"
