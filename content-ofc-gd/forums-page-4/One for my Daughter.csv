She does have many options to choose from but any time a rod longer than 7'6"" is needed she's had to borrow one of mine.  	So as a surprise that she'll see this afternoon I built her an NFC HM St 964-2 (9'6"" ~ 6-12 line rating), and paired it up with a Shimano Twin Power C3000XG.  	I'm thinking she'll be quite surprised.  🙂       "
1084534,CrowMan,2023-04-06 13:22:00,413,Wow very nice ! Beautiful rod and that reel is top shelf ! Lucky girl to have a Dad like you...
1084535,Barry Willis,2023-04-06 13:47:00,180,"Good for you Spiel. That is a very beautiful rod and reel combo it truly is and very practical, I love it. I would be very proud to be standing shoulder to shoulder amongst other anglers with it in my hands. It is so nice to see parents getting there youngsters into fishing. Thanks to old Pappy here my whole family including my Grand children and especially my wife are very much into it. I do not know about these days but back in the 80s fishing was the fastest growing outdoor sport in North America. Sadly in todays society it seems to have died off some what. I am sure your daughter will have many pleasurable hours reeling in lunkers with it.  Thanks for sharing."
