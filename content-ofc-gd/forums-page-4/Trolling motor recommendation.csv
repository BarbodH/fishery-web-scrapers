1084236,Musky Plug,2023-03-15 22:05:00,398,"If you’re able, I would suggest checking out all of the brands at the fishing show this weekend and speak to the reps at the respective booths. Might be able to scoop a TM up there for a “sale” price."
1084237,captpierre,2023-03-15 22:23:00,2521,"Talking to a rep is good to point out their features and maybe strengths. But they won’t ever tell you their weaknesses. Gotta talk to you guys, reviews or the competition to find out the full picture.  	I’ve dealt with reps all my career. Can’t trust any of them."
1084240,AKRISONER,2023-03-16 13:24:00,5558,You are getting some really good info in this thread. In fact the motor suggested to you is sold out all of the time…there’s a very good reason for that. you could go to the motorguide booth and they will tell you their trolling motors are the best thing since sliced bread.
1084241,BillM,2023-03-16 15:12:00,17367,"Hard to beat the 60in 24V 80lb Terrova.  I've had mine since I believe 2012?   I had to replace the actuator on the front in order to stow it, but that's about it.   Simple grease job after each season is all that I do.    I love that motor."
1084242,porkpie,2023-03-16 16:24:00,2521,Cabelas says in stock online for $2300 plus tax.  I’m not sure how accurate that is but worth a shot!  Even if they drop ship it could be worth the wait.
1084244,Dara,2023-03-16 23:50:00,3052,I don't know what to say here and after perusing the replys it's more difficult. How bout you steer your own boat and hold it on a fishing spot. Give the fish a chance  Rant over..LOL
1084247,captpierre,2023-03-17 00:20:00,2521,Yes and yes
1084248,captpierre,2023-03-17 00:30:00,2521,"Hit the Sportsman Show today. Thanks to input from many, I pulled the trigger on a Terrova 60” 80lb with remote and foot pedal. $2675 instead of $2800. Will have to wait till May-June.  	No MinnKota booth. Only 1 of their reps at Radioworld.  	No Terrovas or Ulterras to examine. Only Powerdrives on boats. 🤷🏻‍♂️. Not many tackle dealers.  Lots of Chinese ATVs. No Honda.  	Pretty good hunting booths.  	Overpaid to get in. Seniors $15. Starts at 60 yrs. 🤕 Forgot to ask."
1084252,RickOnt,2023-03-17 12:55:00,669,What dealer did you get the Terrova from? Good choice you will enjoy it.
1084253,captpierre,2023-03-17 12:57:00,2521,Radioworld
1084254,lew,2023-03-17 13:09:00,12766,Fishing used to be so simple before all the crazy expensive electronics came along LOL
1084255,Musky Plug,2023-03-17 13:30:00,398,You won’t be disappointed. Did you get the i pilot or I pilot link?
1084256,Beans,2023-03-17 14:25:00,3339,Sure was Lew...I started using a long bamboo pole and with a tincan with worms we picked the night before...My grandpa never owned a rod and reel and I never got one until I was 12 years old for Christmas...LOL 
1084257,captpierre,2023-03-17 14:38:00,2521,No link.  	Came close to not getting the pedal and built in transducer. I haven’t use a bow screen yet. Would have saved $400.
1084258,captpierre,2023-03-17 14:40:00,2521,I asked Radioworld who’s going to look after me if I have a problem?  	Said Rocky’s in Orillia or Aikman in Mississauga.
1084259,AKRISONER,2023-03-17 18:56:00,5558,"+1 for aikmans, the guy is a man of few words, but hes honest and does good work. Thats all you can ask for these days."
1084260,CrowMan,2023-03-17 19:59:00,413,"+2...Dave only says what needs to be said that's for sure. I'd like to spend a couple of hours sniffing around that basement...it's like a ""closet of curiousities"".... ..and the Philipino food next door is pretty good too.."
1084261,AKRISONER,2023-03-17 20:23:00,5558,"Multiple times I have gone in, and even when he discovered a problem with a powerdrive that was unfortunately not fixable he was adamant that he would not charge me because he was unable to fix the problem."
1084271,Musky Plug,2023-03-18 23:21:00,398,"Heard all good things about aikmans in Mississauga. I did see an ulterra in box at the Canadian tackle depot booth, didn’t see cost."
1084430,captpierre,2023-03-29 18:22:00,2521,Just got a call from RadioWorld My Terrova is in.  The ETA was May. 👍
1084432,Fang,2023-03-29 21:00:00,1330,"Great thread gents as I've convinced myself that it time for an upgrade, Very similar set up as original post Crestliner FH 1750 with newer HB's on deck and console and currently running and older 70lb Maxxum 24V that has been with me through all kinds of nonsense over the years and never let me down. Honestly some of the stuff that that motor did was medal worthy hahaha. In my older age  I'm torn to give up the foot pedal as half of me is still in my 20's running weed lines and crashing through slop with a foot pedal but my older ego wants to sit Bill Dance like on the casting platform and press a button on a remote. After all the reviews above I'm leaning now that a Terrova 80 lb 60"" with IPILOT, foot pedal and remote (just in case) is in the plans so any recent stock availability or deals seen out there would be appreciated. DM if preferred and yes I will post old faithful here in the want ads for an OFC special price as I know there's so much more life left in that unit."
1084467,Mr Greedydrift,2023-03-31 23:52:00,25,"I think launching your boat and depending on the Ulterra trolling motor to bring your boat back to the dock is very amusing. Looks great on the video but one day something will go wrong and you will be swimming to get your boat back. LOL Hope its not cold. I launch solo all the time and ive never had a problem. Use a 20ft rope from the front side cleat. There is always something to tie to. If not, tie off to your trailer winch post.  "
1084469,porkpie,2023-04-01 01:26:00,2521,"I will say that the terrova foot peddle saved me a fishing day on the Niagara once when the remote crapped out.  I never use a foot pedal but I was glad to have it the one time I needed it, the remote is generally pretty reliable and I always carry spare batteries but that one went bad and I had to get a new remote."
1084173,captpierre,2023-03-11 16:35:00,2521,"Hey Guys, 	I fish Pigeon Lake mainly for eyes, Bluegills and occasionally musky. Weededges and humps.  My ride is a 2007 Lund Tyee 1750. My current motor is a 2007 Minn Kota Powerdrive V2 24v without Spotlock.  Works fine.  My electronics is a Lowrance HDS 7 with over 600 waypoints. Will likely upgrade that to Humminbird at some point to sinc with MinnKota.  	But it’s  often windy and it’s a pain to keep on a spot or follow a weed line.  	Thinking of upgrading to a new Powerdrive or TerraNova. Which would you prefer?  And is a handheld remote alone sufficient?  I’d have no footpedal and cable to take up space. Seems better but want to know what experience says.   Thanks."
1084174,Reelpro,2023-03-11 16:57:00,73,"I run an older 36v with spotlock . Handheld remote is all you will need .  Tether around neck. I do have. a foot pedal stowed away for emergencies, but never use it. Spare remote and spare batteries. Game changer, don’t use an anchor much either any longer."
1084176,BillM,2023-03-11 17:11:00,17367,"24V Terrova 60in 80lb without a doubt.   I use the foot pedal way more then I ever use the hand held, especially when I'm musky fishing."
1084179,Dan668,2023-03-11 19:44:00,1120,"Based on what was listed, Terrova for sure since you intend to go to Humminbird. The Xi5 can sync with certain Lowrance units however the foot pedal takes some getting used too. My Terrova served me well in the past, but I now run a Ghost. Whatever you choose, you will love the spot lock. I personally love the foot pedal for bass and musky. Hardly use the remotes on any of the motors I have had."
1084181,AKRISONER,2023-03-11 21:02:00,5558,"Terrova 24v ipilot without a single doubt if money is no issue, get a Garmin force, probably way overkill for your application though"
1084183,RickOnt,2023-03-11 21:51:00,669,I agree with Bill on the motor a Terrova 60 in 80 lbs thrust 24 v ipilot and spotlock But I use the remote  way more than the foot pedal However I do not fish for Musky  Its just finding one is the challenge 
1084184,Musky Plug,2023-03-11 22:02:00,398,"I can’t speak to any other brands but if you’re going Minnkota would choose the Terrova. If you’re going to change to bird units I would go with I pilot link. That’s one regret of mine, not getting the I pilot link. If you choose to do your own mapping on the bird units the I pilot link can take you down the specific contour line. Both foot pedal and remote have their time and place, but I tend to use the remote more when fishing walleye and the foot pedal more fishing musky/pike/bass. If you need one sooner maybe check out sportsman show next weekend. They had deals on electronics and stuff and the last fishing show a few weeks ago."
1084185,captpierre,2023-03-11 22:27:00,2521,"I’m reading about the Ulterra. Self deploy and stow. Easy depth change.  	However, seem to be lots of problems."
1084187,Musky Plug,2023-03-11 23:24:00,398,"I have seen YouTube vids and read other forums where people have had issues late into the season using the ulterra and it freezing up and the auto stow/ deploy feature not working. If you don’t fish into late season shouldn’t be an issue. Other than that, not sure about other issues."
1084188,BillM,2023-03-12 00:07:00,17367,Ulterra definitely requires it's owners to keep up on maintenance.
1084189,CrowMan,2023-03-12 00:23:00,413,"If your battery runs out of juice while  the Ulterra is deployed, it can turn into a bit of a nightmare. That was case with the first generation, not sure if they have rectified this issue."
1084190,AKRISONER,2023-03-12 05:03:00,5558,"Major deployment issues with the ulterra. Minkotta/Johnson outdoors are not known for their reliability in products. They have a few gems like the Fortrex and terrova, but buyer beware of a lot of their other stuff. the ultrex has essentially been a nightmare until the newer versions. Even then they wear out quick. Bushing, etc problems."
1084193,fisherman7,2023-03-12 15:40:00,325,"So I've got the Ulterra and I've had no issues at all, except once I let my batteries get too low and it would only come up half way. Still got home, and it was my fault as I knew I needed newer batteries. Came up and stowed after a short charge. I fish Upper Buckhorn and it can get choppy. The number of times I almost fell in stowing my old trolling motor!!! I have to admit it's pretty cool to see the look on other faces when I hit the deploy button from the back of the boat or the stow button. Others may have had issues but I've had none going on 3 years now. Good luck with whatever you choose."
1084207,mike rousseau,2023-03-14 01:32:00,4661,When I ordered my boat in 2022 I got a minn Kota 80lb 60” terrova with ipilot  due to COVID shortages I ended up either waiting extra 6+ months for that motor or get i-Pilot link  so deal split difference for me to upgrade  Looking back I’m happy I was put in that position because the link features are awesome  
1084210,limeyangler,2023-03-14 04:01:00,5204,"I-pilot Link is the way to go, like someone else mentioned used in conjunction with autochart mapping it’s worth it’s weight in gold, my favourite feature while fishing walleye is to spend time mapping out structure then moving your cursor with the remote to any spot incrementally, wherever you leave the cursor the Ipilot will take you there and spot lock automatically, I can even access all remote functions on the fishfinder too. I think Power Drive models can only work with the foot pedal OR the remote, whereas the Terrovas and Ulterras can run simultaneously. I have an Ulterra and I had some deploy issues a few times, but it was mainly because I did not do recommend maintenance and lots of dragging my boat miles on dusty bush roads, it ticked me off for sure but I kept my old Terrova as back up. WARNING…Once you use the self deploying Ulterra you won’t want to ever have to get up to deploy a trolling motor ever again."
1084211,porkpie,2023-03-14 04:01:00,2521,I’ve been pretty happy with my terrova.
1084215,captpierre,2023-03-14 12:25:00,2521,Dropped into Gannon yesterday. Having difficulty getting Terrova 60” 80lb. Said it’s the most popular motor out there. They get them in a few at a time. Gone next day.  	$2800 with pedal an no ilLink.
1084218,RickOnt,2023-03-14 13:12:00,669,"That,s what I have found also. Either out of stock or backordered"
1084220,BassMan11,2023-03-14 13:58:00,583,Been running the same Ulterra since 2018 with 0 issues. Running a tiller (where I am always at the back of the boat) its a great feature when friends or family are in the boat. Then the auto trim is awesome when getting in shallow for snags etc.   Like anything you need to take care of your stuff and it will last a long time. Kept in a garage and a small amount of maintenance after every trip keep it working excellent. I almost never use the pedal... the remote works great.  Would definitely recommend. What I think the most useful perk is launching and trailering the boat solo. I fish solo quite a bit so personally for me I would never buy another type of trolling motor.  No dock needed... no help needed. The video below is literally every time I pull up to a ramp and someone is watching. Good luck with the decision   
1084221,captpierre,2023-03-14 14:28:00,2521,Good to hear. What kind of maintenance is required?
1084222,CrowMan,2023-03-14 15:23:00,413,"If you're primarily a Walleye angler, you may want to consider the new MEGA Live Imaging Target Lock feature from MinnKota/HumminBird. This allows you to spot lock the TM, but still independently aim the MEGA Live scanning...and even keep it locked on a  target (fish or structure) even the though the boat is swinging around maintaining its fixed position. Nice option, as it negates the decision whether to install your scanning transducer on your TM or on a seperate pole mount. I may be wrong, but I believe it's currently only available on the Ultrex....however, Ultrex also offers  cable steer if you want to ""hunt"" Bass. Wish Garmin would offer this on their imaging transducers and TM's.... as I've been kicking around what to do... "
1084223,AKRISONER,2023-03-14 16:32:00,5558,The issue is that mega live is a far inferior product to livescope especially now with the LVs34  even the 32 is still better than mega live at current
1084224,CrowMan,2023-03-14 16:44:00,413,Hence my wish...
1084225,BassMan11,2023-03-14 16:46:00,583,Make sure the shaft is lubricated (thats what she said) with a silicone lubricant. White lithium grease on some components inside when the side covers are off. There are a few video's on Youtube that go over things extensively. Nothing too crazy. Also what others said before about if your batteries die you are in trouble that is defiantly a thing. So you just need to be mindful of that. I just got batteries big enough to know i'd need 2 full days hard on the TM before i'd need to worry. You can manually stow the unit but then need to take it to a dealer to get it fixed after... not an easy process from what I have seen. Lots of ways to keep track of your battery voltage though...
1084226,AKRISONER,2023-03-14 16:55:00,5558,"If you’ve got a cable steer style/wireless footpedal like the force…I’m going to recommend running the livescope and not worrying about target lock until some more time has been spent figuring it out.  to not be using livescope=you’re missing out.  get one for this upcoming season and never look back. Trust me, using it with a Garmin force…you will most certainly put more fish in the boat, it’s not even a question. in some applications, like fishing laketrout jigging in the spring when they are up in <50fow but are still not right to bottom? My goodness remember it’s not just about finding fish either, it literally feels like cheating when you can see the piece of structure you want to fish 30 feet in front of the boat. I think my last 4 tournaments I managed to catch a fish that I literally saw eat, we fished a rail piling on rice in October during a gale, it was effectively impossible to figure out how to approach the structure without live. you couldn’t go right on top of it, the fish wouldn’t bite cause the boat was going nuts in the wind and waves. I marked it with the livescope and got the correct angle with the wind and let the force spotlock and we proceeded to just toss baits at it all day."
