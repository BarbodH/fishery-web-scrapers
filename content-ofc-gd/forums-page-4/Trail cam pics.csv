1084755,Barry Willis,2023-04-17 15:56:00,180,Just a couple pics I thought I would post as not everyone has the opportunity to see these guys in the wild. These were from last month the camera wont let me change the year. I just swapped memory cards yesterday morning. I don't know what is wrong with my computer but could only send one pic and it took twenty minutes to do that.

1084773,Barry Willis,2023-04-17 21:22:00,180,Thanks Limeyangler. I have lots more but I can't post them. I will give it another try. I see lots of bobcats but lynx are much more elusive.
