1084327,Sneakypete,2023-03-23 19:04:00,3,I’m pretty new to fishing/boating in general and am in the planning stage for summer fishing trips and I’m wondering about the Onatobee section near rice lake. How heavy are the weeds? Is there an open channel throughout that section where weeds don’t reach the surface? I’m asking as I have a peddle kayak. I tried fishing Rice  last summer and had trouble getting around due to the weeds getting caught in propeller. I have a shoulder issue so paddling a sit on top yak in the wind through weeds can be problematic at times. I’m just hoping the river has enough deep channels to get around ok. All feedback welcome. Thanks in advance.

That includes where the river empties into rice, although it’s been a few years."
1084331,Weeds,2023-03-23 22:19:00,782,Should mention there is a fair bit of boat traffic though
1084334,Sneakypete,2023-03-23 22:53:00,3,Thanks Weeds. Appreciated. Yeah I suspect the boat traffic could be problematic on a yak but I’m going to try mid week so hopefully not too bad.
