The attendance fell far short of our pre Covid numbers but the evening was over all a success with approximately 140/150 people in attendance. I don't have many pictures as yet from the evening, I will share more when I have some.  	On behalf of the membership, the executive and myself, we all send our gratitude and thanks to Mr David Chong for making the trip to the Hammer to talk about our mutual passion, fishing!  	Good to see you again David, cheers and best wishes for the upcoming open water fishing season.  "
