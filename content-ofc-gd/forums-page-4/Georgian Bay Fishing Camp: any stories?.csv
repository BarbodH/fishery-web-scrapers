1083800,prawnstar,2023-02-12 17:25:00,1,"First post here. Yes, Fisherman and akashag and I had some good times up there. That old steel boat took some serious beatings on the Ottawa River. Also fished it for years in Georgian Bay in the Meaford Owen Sound area. In 1998 my wife and I went on a ""retreat"" to GBFC. Dave picked us up at Key River. We got to the camp and he pointed us to our cabin. Upon entering the cabin it was filled with ""stuff"". There were two single assembled crappy beds. Staff came to take the junk out and assemble the beds. Apparently there were no other cabins available. We but the two beds together and got a fire going in the woodstove. During the night we dealt with mice and cold. My wife was NOT impressed. During the entire week we were there staff were conducted repairs to the docks with chainsaws and skill saws and hammering all day. To add insult to injury Dave charged me several hundred dollars more than he had quoted me. I argued about the terrible shack we were in and the fact I had helped his guys out a few times and I was a return customer, but to no avail. My menu had included at least one fish fry which never did occur. Needless to say that was the last time I went to that crap hole. Lesson learned was it's not the same going there with buddies and drinking our faces off than going there with your wife. That's all I got to say bout that!!!"

1083811,ripnjig,2023-02-13 16:51:00,5,"Visited GBFC throughout the nineties, usually a spring and a summer trip. Big Dave was a great host. As mentioned not the best location to take the spouse: central showers, cleanliness and boardwalk always needed improving but a good guys trip. on more than one occasion put my foot through a decayed walkway board. Loved the pick up and ride in from the Key river through the narrow passageway at high speed. Monster pike in the spring still fishing with live sucker minnows. Found Walleye in the outer bays narrow always good especially in the evening. Loved the steel hull boats. Dave used to say there's no way you're not going to hit a rock - he was right. Can't remember the lady's name at the lodge. Doris or Dorothy? She would cook up the walleye. Found out of the demise of the camp through a vendor at the sportsman show. All he said was that circumstances to the decline was a sad story. Fond memories an good times I will always cherish.  "
1084639,Bruce B,2023-04-12 22:16:00,3,My wife & I stayed there for a few days in 2010.  I did some paintings and enjoyed dinners nightly with Dave.  We were the only guests at the time which was a little worrisome.  Anyway we had a good time. Can anyone tell me how to find it on a map ?  i.e. the name of the island /island group or lat and long.  We were picked up in Britt and it was a confusing ride of many islands.... I see that Dave passed away and the place is closed and in decay. SAD----would like to have gone back.....spectacular scenery.....thanks for any help ---- bruce from Washington State  [email protected]
1084643,Chuck c,2023-04-13 01:36:00,3,Really hard to give directions to the island. Don’t know the coordinates. We made the trip soo many times out of the key river that we knew the route really good. Although could be a rough ride in the open bay. We used to fish a bay we called Pete’s bay that was really close to camp. Also right across from camp we fished old timers bay. And fox bay wasn’t too far from camp. These bays are on the map of the area
1084644,BillM,2023-04-13 02:24:00,17367,"Located here.  45.916118370517815, -80.86427305237284"
1084648,Bruce B,2023-04-13 03:41:00,3,"Thanks so much !! -- found it on Google Maps - satellite view.  You can see the buildings ( fuzzy ).  Looks like it is just west of the Outer Fox Islands very near a circular island = Dock Island.  We had the southern most cabin as Dave said that was the best for artists.  He pointed out the Bustard Rocks in the distance. He cooked steaks each night for us & him and I didn't complain !  In retrospect he was probably disappointed that we didn't rent a boat but a fisherman pulled in one day to get fuel and he gave me nice water tour for a couple hours including a beer with his son and wife at their cabin nearby.  That fellow comes each year from England for a month.  It looks like quite a distance from Britt but I guess there is no road into Key Harbor so maybe that is why guests without their own boats are picked at Britt.  Like others I wish it was still up and going.  His wife gave us a ride out and told me that Dave loved the place and would probably die there.....  perhaps he did.  : (  He told me that he had to put a $30, 000 septic system by regulations and that was a big blow to finances....... We are planning to come back to somewhere around Georgian Bay in September 2023.....hard to find a resort / camp like that one though that is out in the bay(  instead at the edge ).  I love that landscape -- it is unique......      "
1084657,Chuck c,2023-04-13 11:53:00,3,It definitely is a beautiful area we fell in love with it. I guess that’s a big reason we returned every year for soo many years. We had a group of six guys that made the trip all family. Now there’s only two of us left soo that camp has some very fond memories for me. Really was the best week of the year for all six of us.
1084664,BillM,2023-04-13 15:37:00,17367,I don't know why you'd ever go in there from Britt.  Key River is the best choice.
1084666,Electrcx,2023-04-13 16:18:00,3,Ur coordinates are spot on. Right in the lower south French Delta.  It’s a fast ride out from the key if you take the narrow high speed passage. Lol.  The water was really low last summer and those 2 rocks you fly by were poking out of the water. Safer to stay in the channel for the extra 10mins. What a great spot. I stop by every year still for a look. I have a place up the Henvey.  It’s a nice little boat ride to check out the old camp. The place needs a miricale to make it go again. Would be amazing. Great memories for sure. The monopoly board in the dining room is still set up from the last game that was played there. Amazing. Here’s a couple shots from this year.  
1084713,Bruce B,2023-04-16 04:04:00,3," Thanks so much for the photos, brings back memories. I agree it would be lovely if someone would clear out all the old buildings, walkways & stuff. Take it down to dirt, vegetation and stone.  Then build a new similar Camp, modest so they average guys could afford a few days but modern and comfortable. I would book a stay for sure : ).  I wonder if the property is for sale and if there are some legacy environmental cleanup issues -- discarded chemicals, oil, fuels....etc ? That could get real expensive to remediate......  Yup, I think  you said it --- a miracle !  ( unfortunately )........  Here is a shot from our stay in  2010 -- happier days but you could still tell it wasn't getting the maintenance it needed...... "
1084728,ripnjig,2023-04-16 15:22:00,5,"Always did well there fishing in the ninety's. PB pike 45"" and no shortage of walleye  - they loved floating rapalas in the evening. Have not fished the area since our multiple trips back then. Any fishing reports from the general area? wondering if it's worth a venture. Thanks. "
1084753,BillM,2023-04-17 15:51:00,17367,"Fishing is always good out there.   That's never a problem.     It's usually the weather people have issues with, or aren't prepared for."
1084775,ripnjig,2023-04-17 21:33:00,5,"Thanks for the reply BillM. Fishing for me the last 25 years has been almost exclusively on Nipissing - just love that lake. But suddenly  I really have an urge to relive the great times and locations of the past. Been retired 2 years now and with time at hand, it's amazing how the mind can transport you with great detail and clarity to old milestones and events."
1084794,BillM,2023-04-18 03:05:00,17367,No prob.  I spend some time on Nipissing in Sept chasing big toothy critters.  Love that lake as well.
1011587,singingdog,2017-08-18 11:54:00,1047,"We paddled past this place on our last kayak trip. Wondering if anyone knows the story behind it. Some parts looked derelict/abandoned, some buildings looked almost new. All the boats were pulled up, upside down, no motors. It's in a stunning location - right at the mouth of the French River -  and I imagine the fishing is excellent. Just wondering what's happening or what happened."
1011614,jimmer,2017-08-18 17:46:00,2730,"I tried to google that place to find out the exact location, but limited info. I think those places are a tough go and very expensive to operate. Let us know if you find out."

1011618,Reef Runner,2017-08-18 18:10:00,980,I think Ohio has it.  I recall looking into staying here and doing a bit of research a few years back.  Ended up staying at the Pick River Marina; easier access. Awesome area!
1011619,myot,2017-08-18 18:19:00,131,Fished that area a few times and its pretty good but the fish aren't as friendly as they are to the south of their by 30 miles or so. I'm not positive but I think they might see a bit more fishing pressure  Dan
1011627,Cast-Away,2017-08-18 20:16:00,790,I remember fishing and camping near the lodge back in the 1980's and it was certainly remote and not easy to get to by boat. You either had to traverse down the the French River and Bad River and shoot the rapids or take the rough boat ride out the Key River and through the open bay. Fishing the bay was tricky because of all of the shoals and with the open water it was often too rough to fish or if it was cloudy you couldn't see the shoals.
1011669,2 tone z71,2017-08-19 18:38:00,1311,The owners health failed a few yrs back and the kids shut it down.
1011698,singingdog,2017-08-20 12:23:00,1047,"I can't imagine fishing the area around this camp from a motorboat without a very knowledgable guide, and several spare props. Several times we would be on fairly decent open-water crossings only to find ourselves in 1 FOW with no warning. It's a maze of channels and shoals out there, but some very fishy water. Saw a few monster smallies cruising the shallows. I would love to go back and do a mother-ship kayak  or SUP fishing trip. Anybody have a house boat they want to lend me?"
1011715,Headhunter,2017-08-20 15:05:00,5703,"My wife and I spent a week there back in the early 90's. Fairly rustic, but they did have a generator that they ran during daylight hours. Fishing there can be tough and has been mentioned, reefs are everywhere! Don't know what happened to the place as we have never gone back. HH"
1011956,Brian Wilson,2017-08-23 19:04:00,5,"I was a regular at that camp for close to 30 years, beginning in the mid 70's as a boy, and as late as 2010. It was rugged for sure, but holding its own until the early 2000's, when the owner's health steadily declined, and the camp slowly fell into neglect/disrepair through no fault of his. He passed away a few years ago and it never really was re-opened.  It is a fascinating corner of Georgian Bay as it meets The French, and it is littered with shoals like you would not believe. Having said that, I think I came to learn (and probably ding) about every one of them, and knew the area so well that we routinely fished at night.  With few exceptions, we generally caught quality over quantity and had to work hard for our walleyes. But The Bay in that area holds HUGE eyes and pike and smallies. I've seen hundreds of 10 lb walleyes over the years, and some 11's-12's too. One morning in particular we landed 4 10 lb walleyes from my favorite honey hole there...  I miss it and have great memories of that camp and the owner (he was a nice guy and a good chap)."
1011957,Fisherman,2017-08-23 19:41:00,7201,You must be referring to Dave Bulger?
1011962,Brian Wilson,2017-08-23 20:20:00,5,Yes. Knew him for years. He was a good bloke.
1011967,tizfun,2017-08-23 20:55:00,292,"Fished at the camp from 1988 till just before Dave's death... After his sledding accident, he wasn't the same.. Last time I was there, it was starting to get run down.. Dave's boat broke down on our way back . Puttered in with the kicker.. Walls on the cabins were full of holes.. boats were not clean and so on...  I loved that place and went every spring for pike opener... I remember my first time there... Took my own boat in.. got lost.. hit many shoals and decided that this wasn't for me...lol   Went back the year after and used his boats, They were fun times and fishing was one of the best ,if not the best I've encountered...  40 pike in a weekend and the smallest being 6 lbs.. Walleye were tough, but when you caught, you caught some beauties... Caught my PB pike there.. 23 lbs and I'll never see another one...  I miss Georgian Bay Camp.. Miss Dave and all the great stories and laughs we shared...   RIP my good friend..."

1012005,Brian Wilson,2017-08-24 13:23:00,5,"It would cost a fortune to get that camp up and running again. It really went downhill in the last 10 years before it shut down. Really bad septic issues. I know the area well enough to take my boat up there in the future, via the Key. Last few years it's been deep enough to navigate. On my bucket list of things to do..."
1081319,Electrcx,2022-07-27 19:14:00,3,Was just up there last weekend on the French.  Water is really low. Lots of rocks everywhere close to top of water. Better know where to go and now WOT. Lol. 	I came out of the Henvey inlet. for a Where I have a camp. The Place is ruined. Defiantly major septic issues from the past. It is and Over grown mess. Buildings are In peril. Someone has defiantly squatted in the back cabin facing the open bay. I opened a few doors and had a peak. What an amazing place it must have been at one time. Animals have defiantly made homes and feces every where. Snakes feeding grounds. I would love to make that place go again. Private or public. Needs a ton work and money. I will defiantly go back to check it out some more on my adventures. Anyone know how to get ahold of the new owners? Are the taxes even getting paid??  I love this place some one contact me please.

1081334,akaShag,2022-07-28 12:12:00,2073,"I wrote two articles about Georgian Bay Fishing Camp for Ontario Fisherman magazine back in the day.  One was about the walleye, and one about the smallmouth. I caught my PB walleye there one spring, about 12 pounds.  I had just paid fairly big $$$ to have a 10.5 lb walleye mounted and did not think I wanted to invest more in a fish that was not ""THAT"" much bigger.  I had previously asked Dave if he wanted a good walleye that he could have mounted for display and to show off at the fishing shows, and he said yes, so I kept that fish and gave it to him.  He agreed that he would put a plaque on it with my name.  Well...........Dave was not always real good about following up on stuff.  He did get the fish mounted and brought it to the Toronto Sportsman's Show, but with no plaque on it with my name.  But he always intended to get that done.  And it was a LOT bigger than the one I have on my wall....... When he drove guests back and forth to Key River he would go through one shoal that had just a hair more room on both sides than the width of his boat.  And he would take it at full throttle.  That always got reactions from his guests........😉"
1083761,Chuck c,2023-02-11 03:29:00,3,"Fished Georgian bay fishing camp from 1977 until early 2000’s. Used to go every year and really enjoyed our trip. When we first start going in 1977 a fellow named Tom Beaudry and his wife Joy were the owners. Back then the cabins were very primitive and Tom the owner wasn’t exactly a people person although his wife was very sweet.  	the walleye fishing in the seventies and the early eighties was tremendous. Caught tons of walleyes and bass and just had the best times of our lives.  	I believe it was sometime in the eighties that Tom Beaudry had a heart attack and passed away. I believe he was only in his forty’s but he was a high stressed guy.  	that’s when Dave bought the camp and really made some nice improvements.  	Dave was a really nice guy and we enjoyed his company. Little by little the walleye fishing fell off and with the lowering water level it was difficult to catch fish. Last time there Dave was in poor health and the camp was in decline.  	looking back on those trips with my family it was the best week of the year soo much fun, I miss it.  	Used to fish with a gentleman from canton Ohio named Jim Clark he was kind of a legend and a great fisherman, always caught the biggest walleye. Pretty sure someone put a plaque with his name on one of the spots he used to fish."

1083775,akaShag,2023-02-11 16:44:00,2073,Marcel bought one of those steel boats from Dave and ran it into a shoal on the Ottawa River.  Didn't hurt it a bit!  That shoal would have opened up an aluminum boat like a can opener.  😉 Great memories for sure.
