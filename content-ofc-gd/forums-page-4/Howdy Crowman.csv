1084454,Barry Willis,2023-03-31 15:45:00,180,It appears you posted on the forum here but I am unable to open it up. It goes to Fisherman's post. I've have it happen a few time before. Being old and old school I'm not all that computer literate so I don't know the reason. Maybe it's our computer. Thank you.
1084455,CrowMan,2023-03-31 17:29:00,413,"Hi Barry...not sure what you mean, or what you're looking for ? If you have a specific question, I'd be happy to help you out."
1084456,CrowMan,2023-03-31 18:18:00,413,"Ahh...I think I know what happened... I ""liked"" your post about the new boat. You probably got an email saying that I ""reacted to your post"". Doesn't mean that I actually posted something. It just means that little ""blue heart"" symbol appears at the bottom of your post. No worries about being computer literate...I'm an old fart too.."
1084457,Beans,2023-03-31 18:22:00,3339,Are'nt we all...LOL 
1084458,Barry Willis,2023-03-31 18:52:00,180,"Thanks Guy's, I got it now Crowman. Thank you. I'm glad I'm not alone when it comes to computer literacy. I'm going to have to find a young whipper snapper to show me how to work my felix7. I hope he has lots of time cause we're going to need it, LOL."
1084459,CrowMan,2023-03-31 19:05:00,413,"BTW Barry,Â  congrats on the new boat ! Speaking of old farts...you may want to make the boat a little more senior friendly. Cut a couple of pieces of plywood to fit in the bottom of the hull in the bow and between the middle seats (where the V of the hull is more prominent). You can make a pattern with cardboard, and then trace it on to the plywood to cut the profile with a jigsaw. Cover the plywood with outdoor carpet or marine flooring vinyl (glued on). That way you have a nice flat stable platform if you stand to cast, or just getting in and out. I twisted an ankle once or twice on an old tinner I had before making this simple and cheap modification...the sloped sides of wet slippery aluminum didn't get along with old legs..."
