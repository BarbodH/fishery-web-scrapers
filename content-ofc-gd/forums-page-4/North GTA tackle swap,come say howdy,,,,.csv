Home for months during the covid hit, working weekends gives me to much time on my hands .I have so much stock built up,I need to get rid of some of it. Going to be a blow out sale,so get some while they last. Twitch,jig and ice grubs and a few others. Way too many to post pics of.   "

1084593,misfish,2023-04-08 22:34:00,29133,"We are back home now and would like to thank the North GTA Tackle Swap and David Chong for allowing myself and granddaughter to attend and to sell what I had to offer to the fishing gang that showed up. It was a great feeling listening to everyone that stopped to talk. Those that knew what I was selling,had no problem picking out what they liked ( some mentioned,so many to pick through ) and even asked if I could do some other ties for them. One particular talk was with a gentleman that has a brother that is out in BC . Was a great chat with him . Those that passed by and just seen something fishing related,looked through my creations and were very appreciative of the collection of them . Not sure it was the busiest this show has been,( long Easter weekend ),but still managed to get many of my ties sold, and new fishing customers which made me very warm hearted . For sure will be attending next season ."
