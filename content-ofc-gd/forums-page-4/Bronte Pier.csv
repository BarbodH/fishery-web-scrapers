1084681,Duckie,2023-04-14 12:55:00,305,Anyone know if the gate at Bronte Pier is open? Used to fish there all the time but a locked gate showed up during the pandemic and I know I have been down there and the gate is locked. Looking to cast for some browns oh yeah thanks!
1084684,CrowMan,2023-04-14 13:23:00,413,"The west pier is open to fishing. Frankly, it's been a few years since I've seen any Browns caught there with any regularity...may be one or two still around, but since the OMNR stopped stocking them, it's not like it used to be. More likely to catch an Atlantic there these days (not that they're common either). It's still pretty good for Steelhead, but most of the run passed through a  couple of weeks ago...they're for the most part all up the creek spawning or getting ready to. With the new early season C&R season for Bass, they may be your  best bet. They should start stacking up in the harbour soon. You have until May 10th. Always a few regulars there, regardless. Best of luck if you go. "
1084685,Duckie,2023-04-14 15:22:00,305,ok thanks! I'll try to get out there and give it a shot
1084688,Duckie,2023-04-14 15:53:00,305,Any idea why they stopped the stocking? was it budget cuts? Im assuming it was??
