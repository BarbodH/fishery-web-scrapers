1084368,captpierre,2023-03-26 17:42:00,2521,"Hey Guys.Â  	Doing the spring show circuit. Been on the hunt for a portable defibrillator. My neighbors at the cottage and us agreed to go together on a defibrillator. Â If one of us goes down, seconds count. By the time EMS shows up at the lake it may be too late. Â There were 3 defibrillator booths at Cottage Life Show. Units range from $1200- $2000. Warrantied for 8 yrs and can last 15+ yrs. Need shock pads and lithium batteries replaced every 4 yrs usually. ($3-400) 	Couldnâ€™t decide on which one to get. Several are back ordered.Â  	Also, take a CPR course if you can. I have. Â To do CPR correctly it takes a lot of force. They had a dummy at one booth that gives feedback. My wife tried and didnâ€™t press enough.Â  	Might want to buy less life insurance. Donâ€™t want to give the Mrs a disincentive. Â Just sayin ðŸ˜Ž"

1084391,fisherman7,2023-03-27 21:02:00,325,That's a great idea. I've thought about one for my neighbourhood. We're a community of 30 homes. Have you decided where you would keep it?
1084393,captpierre,2023-03-28 01:47:00,2521,"They canâ€™t freeze. One of our neighbours is fairly central, heats the place all winter and never locks the door."
1084397,woodenboater,2023-03-28 11:49:00,2277,"Be sure to know when to use an AED. They're not meant to revive a person who has no heartbeat (heat attack). Â ie-tv medical shows. As I've seen described elsewhere, a heart attack is a 'plumbing issue' and can't be helped by an AED. A cardiac arrest is an 'electrical issue' and can be aided with the timely use of an AED. Having said all that, getting one for community use is a very smart thing and there really is zero downside."
1084399,captpierre,2023-03-28 13:00:00,2521,"Heart attacks (blockage of the coronary arteries) often cause an arrhythmia that renders the heart beat useless to provide necessary blood pressure. Thatâ€™s why you drop. The heart fibrillates instead of beating properly. Â The AED, once the pads are attached, reads whatâ€™s going on and knows to shock only when appropriate. The machine talks you through everything. Some can tell you if chest compressions are being done adequately. Â They can handle children too but some require pediatric pads separately, others use the same paddles."
