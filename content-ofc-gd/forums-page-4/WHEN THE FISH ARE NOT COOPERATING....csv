1084668,Barry Willis,2023-04-13 17:15:00,180,I drive to the local  -  This was a promotion at Safeway years ago with this Mazda Miada. Upon my delivery of the Mazda they had me drive it up and down the aisles before tickets went on sale. I made sure the regional manager got a photo with the fish market sign in the back ground. LOL. (the scratches you see are not on the car. They are on the photo. It was brand new I personally picked it up at the factory and done the PDI myself)
