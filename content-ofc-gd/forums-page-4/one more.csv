1084785,Barry Willis,2023-04-18 00:01:00,180,Well after all my buggering about I lost all my other trail cam pics from last month but this one. The rest were much nicer during daylight hours. I'll have more at the end of May. 
1084795,porkpie,2023-04-18 05:14:00,2521,"Nice lookin Lynx.  We get them on our back trail and by the bear barrels on the regular. They like to hunt the small critters that munch on bear bait.  All kinds of unique visitors show up at the cans, including yogi!  FYI if you have an iPhone, uploading is very easy!   "
1084804,Barry Willis,2023-04-18 15:52:00,180,Looks like ya had a pine marten pay s visit. I love them little guys. Nice black bear if I'm not mistaken  looks like he just needs to grow a little more. Nice pics man.
1084815,smitty55,2023-04-18 18:35:00,928,Pretty sure that's a Fisher judging by the length of it compared to the barrel and the lack of a light coloured throat.
1084825,Barry Willis,2023-04-18 21:15:00,180,"Yes it is so, upon closer inspection it doesn't have the body of a pine marten. I'll pay closer attention from here on."
