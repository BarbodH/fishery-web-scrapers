Done. "

In the box above, sorry same box, it would say done but there was no pic. Then all of a sudden I got this one and then the fight was on again. I wish I had known it was going to work that one time I would have chosen one of the nicer ones. I was going through all them hoping to find a solution.  Once you guys taught me how to post pics I've never had a problem. There was a time recently when I wasn't receiving any posts from the forum and Spiel corrected it for me which I am very grateful for as at my age most days it's my only form of entertainment. LOL."
