1084484,DGeibel,2023-04-02 12:56:00,6,"Looking at Hawk Air out of the Wawa area for fly-in Outposts for a trip next year.  6 guys.  Anyone been to their camps and could make any recommendations? Planning to do a Saturday to Saturday and considering Easey Point, Duffy, Upper Duffy, Lobo, or Wejin Lakes. How was the fishing & accommodations? Are their outposts secluded so no other cabins? private? Flew out of Nakina last year with 7 Lakes Wilderness Camps, had a great trip to Kap Lake, but the guys don’t want to drive up that far next year. Any other outfitters we should consider?  Driving from just south of Cleveland Ohio, not looking for more than a 10 hour drive (including stops for fuel and food). Thanks! "

No shortage of eater Walleye, with the occasional 28""+, and plenty of pike in the 30 to 40"" range. There are a couple of outfitters that have places on the lake, however the lake is so big that you always feel that you have it to yourself. We flew out of White River with Agich's, but I believe Watson's flies there out of Wawa. Anyway, White River and Wawa are only an hour apart on hwy 17."

That whole kapikotongwa system from Marshall to Percy is very good, hope it didn't spoil you too bad"
