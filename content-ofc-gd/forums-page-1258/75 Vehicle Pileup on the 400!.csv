43464,JustinHoffman,2007-03-05 21:04:00,482,"75 vehicles pile up on Highway 400  Mar 05, 2007 03:38 PM Curtis Rush Staff Reporter Whiteout conditions north of the GTA on Highway 400 today contributed to a pileup involving up to 75 vehicles in two locations on the highway, the OPP is reporting.  Buses, trucks and cars collided in a chain reaction near the Highway 400-Highway 89 intersection near Newmarket.  Several other vehicles collided on Highway 400 southbound at Highway 89, almost directly opposite the northbound collisions.  A jack-knifed tractor-trailer in the northbound lanes resulted in many of the collisions, police say.  Several people were taken to area hospitals, but it wasn't immediately known how serious the injuries are.  That section of the highway is expected to be closed in both directions into the evening.  The crashes have closed both the eastbound and westbound ramps on the northbound lanes of Highway 400 at Simcoe Rd. 88 as well.  The Gardiner Expressway in Toronto and Highway 400 near Newmarket are not the only roadways closed at this hour.
