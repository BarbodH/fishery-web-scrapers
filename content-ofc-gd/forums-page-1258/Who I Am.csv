It is where I belong, where I am supposed to be.  It is not a place, but a lifelong journey.  It is a passage my father showed me and I will show to others.  When you understand all of this you will know me and we will fish together."

Nice poem none-the-less! ============================================================================ ""I am a fisherman, for life. I will always be a fisherman.  It's not something I do, it is who I am.  Fishing is not an escape. It is where I belong, where I am supposed to be.  It is not a place, but a lifelong journey.  It is a passage my father showed me, and that I will show others.  When you understand all of this, you will know me, and we will fish together.""  So reads the Abu Garcia advertisement for quality fishing tackle. The words ripple through the minds of ardent sport fishers. It's how we are. We are fishermen for life. If we were orbiting a distant planet we'd be looking for a lake with fish in it. It's what our parents taught us, and we pass it on to those we love. When you understand this, you know who we are.
