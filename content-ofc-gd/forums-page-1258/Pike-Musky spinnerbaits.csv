43065,mepps,2007-03-04 23:25:00,1301,"I make some aswell, mine are geared mostly toward pike.  So far they have produced well at Toronto islands, and i'll be doing more testing this May at LV.  Also got a couple musky at the Bog, as well as some perch, rockbass and largemouth. Each made with #8 french blades...      This is the biggest fish so far, caught on the ""Bog Special""     Big enough for pike and musky, but caught a few smaller fish aswell...  "
43068,GbayGiant,2007-03-04 23:30:00,1780,"Here are a few I made recently, more for musky than pike though...  "

Thanks, but I already have enough inline spinners (I'll keep you in mind in the future).  I'm looking for something like this    Or like this....    The guy that makes these baits is in Alberta, I was hoping to support a local businessman."

43278,Zib,2007-03-05 13:26:00,369,Mr. Brunner makes some great bucktails. His member name on here is Robert Brunner Sr. He's in the Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame & he's a legendary musky guide on Lake St. Clair. I just bought some bucktails from him this past Saturday at BPS in Michigan. Send him a message on how to buy some from him.  Here's a pic of the bucktails (at the top):    His lures are also sold on this site http://www.whitecapstackleco.com/Bucktail.html
