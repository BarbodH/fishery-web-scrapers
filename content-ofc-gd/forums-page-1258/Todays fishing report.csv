Kinda miserable with the blowing snow not so much cold as constant snow in everything .(Face ,bags , flasher ,coffee etc)  Pretty slow with only 2 perch (dinks) and 1/2 doz smelt .  Dropped him at home picked up the portable hut and drove to shanty bay to meet up with my younger son who had gone ahead with a friend and his step dad.  Parked and headed down hill to the lake trying not to get run over by the portable home made hut. Just as I got out to them they had a hit ,few seconds of antcipation ( small whitie ??) nope a herring.  Things looked promising but that was about it for the day expcept one more small herring. Did have a visit from the CO ( first of the year ) glad to see them out  Fished a varity of lures (spreaders ,Bad Boys , spoons ) Herrings on the spreader and a Forage minnow  Kids had fun , fresh air ,good conversation = lots of fun !
