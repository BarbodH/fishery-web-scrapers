Set-up over 30 feet of water and marked nothing for a few minutes..Caught my first few sauger around 10am and continued on trying to find roaming perch and bigger walleye....Swiss-cheesed the whole area punching holes trying to follow the fish around. It payed off..  I was able to ice 17 walleye/sauger by 3:00 and a few small pike... Walleye were in the 15''- 22'' size while the few darts were no more that 25''. I made it to the bait shop at 3:25 so my fish was disqualified. I am sure it would have takes 2nd for sure..  Glad to hear you came fist in the walleye category Nighttroller...I had a gut feeling it was you !!  I did not see any other known members out there...Could barely see my set-line at times...Few snow squals hit us during the day..   First fish of the day...a scrappy sauger..Probably a pounder or so..   Nice little walleye...Kept 4 over 17'' for a snack...   Shot of the Clam...always snap a photo of it...   Hot hole...   Another good walleye from the hot hole..   On the move walter...Didn't stand a chance with the stinger hook stuck in the side of his mouth...   It was another great day on the ice..I can't wait to get back out tomorrow..Thanks Yves for putting on another great derby and to the winners a big congrats...Can't wait to fish next years event..  Oh by the way, crappie have been on fire as well,    -Andrew"
