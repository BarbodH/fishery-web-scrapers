43375,lilkynan,2007-03-05 17:23:00,173,Was wondering if there was much interference from Antis on this site - postings - attacks etc. There must be but we never see them on here - the head dudes must be doing a great job monitoring!!  Has anyone had a run in with Antis in the field?  I did once in Huntsville - I was in my boat and they drove theirs within 2 feet of where I was and starting calling me names and all sort of stuff. Found out later that I should have reported them because it is illegal to interfere with a Hunter or Fisherman (Fisherwoman) while doing legal activity.  Be aware of your rights.  Bare
