43240,Greencoachdog,2007-03-05 10:23:00,8163,That sounds a little chilly for the Banana Belt Lew!
43241,Big Cliff,2007-03-05 10:30:00,6899,"yah, I'm getting tired of all this cold and snow. A few years ago we had ice out on the lake by April 1. last year it was April 11. At the rate we are going this year I'll be ice fishing here when the season opens in May.  Grrrrrrrrrrr!"
43246,Shelley Cooper,2007-03-05 11:11:00,394,That sounds awful Lew... I gotta work in that.... grrrr
43255,DT10Sam,2007-03-05 11:57:00,480,"Well I guess the ice is not going off the BOQ as of yet, I am ready for Spring and the weather is not.  Regards, Sam"
43257,TAH,2007-03-05 12:08:00,133,"Farmers Almanac says that we can expect a major snow storm near the end od March, remember the balmy weather we had late Dec and January, well we are paying for it now."
43258,OhioFisherman,2007-03-05 12:14:00,6623,"LOL Canadian Cold front? Cold here today 27f and dropping warmer by the weekend. Whatever we get now won`t last, spring is next month instead of 4 months!"
43260,Fisherman,2007-03-05 12:24:00,7201,"7:20 am and the wind has really picked up in the last hour, could get gusts up to 90k/mh, now I suppose I'll end up with the neighbours snowbank in my driveway.."
43261,ccmtcanada,2007-03-05 12:42:00,7971,"Wow...how depressing for first thing Monday morning...  Oh well...I always said that if you dont like cold weather, then living in Canada isn't a good idea...LOL"
43269,bpsbassman,2007-03-05 13:01:00,941,"Funny, but I remember in December and early January all the ice fisherman were worried about getting ice. I've had enough and I was fortunate enough to miss all of January!"
43270,fishdawg,2007-03-05 13:06:00,912," Ice is better to have earlier then later Roger. In many areas next week, seasons close & permament huts have to come off.  Ive only been on the ice a handful of times this winter - this weekend I'll be finding an open launch & putting the boat in"
43276,Bob,2007-03-05 13:24:00,370,"In the 28 years I've been in Elliot Lake, the earliest I've been able to put a boat in the lake was April 15th.  A few years back, the lake wasn't open until end of the 3rd week of May.  You can't count on Ma Nature but I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I love spring, bring it on!!!!"

43295,OhioFisherman,2007-03-05 14:05:00,6623,"LOL Bob, Elliot lake is up there a ways. Even here late March most years and then the fishing is hit and miss. Water is too cold to get much action unless you get lucky and park right over them. Pond fishing gives a better chance the water warms quicker. Don`t think I ever put the boat in, in March.  We also have had years when ice was still in launching areas and marinas early in April."
43310,Raf,2007-03-05 14:47:00,3495,Sounds good to me.. longer ice with less crowds when the huts have to come off.
43320,trapshooter,2007-03-05 15:15:00,1234,I'm with you raf.... there's still a lot of ice fishing to be done.  Lets keep the temps on the minus side for a while yet.
43334,OhioFisherman,2007-03-05 15:42:00,6623,"Roger my buddies last day of open water bass fishing was January 6th, they got into them pretty good, latest they have ever bass fished here."
43338,Crazyhook,2007-03-05 15:53:00,1154,to Cuba!!!
43410,SIMCOEBOB,2007-03-05 19:28:00,29,YEA I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS WEATHER---the polish isn't working on the boat. I will be glad to cut the grass again
