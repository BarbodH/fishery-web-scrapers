42939,buckeye_boy,2007-03-04 13:33:00,3,Hey everyone New to the board. Lots of great info. My family and I are coming to Lake Nipissing last wee of June. My first trip there. Anyone ever stayed or been to Prosperpine cottages. And of course what is the fishing like there on Nipissing in last week of June.

Lots of pike, bass, & walleye. Muskie too, though I never hooked into one. For the pike, you can't go wrong with the usual crankbaits, spinnerbaits, or spoons. We caught all our walleye jigging humps or island points.  Good luck, it's a big and fun lake to explore.  Mike"
