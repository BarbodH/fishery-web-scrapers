42074,jil101ca,2007-03-02 14:04:00,41,I'm wondering if any of the hunters on board tan their own hides. I'm trying to learn how using some rabbit skins. I've followed the directions for alum  and also have tried using trappers hide tanning formula but my skins are coming out very stiff even after alot of stretching and working them. I have a deer hide in the freezer but I don't want to touch it until I can do it right. What is the secret to soft hides?

42128,huntervasili,2007-03-02 16:16:00,1604,You have to get the proper oils to add in afterwards... i know several places in canada that sell em and you can get some from Cabelas too... If you want some websites tell me and I will post em for you...
42129,OhioFisherman,2007-03-02 16:16:00,6623,Ditto!
42133,jil101ca,2007-03-02 16:23:00,41,When do I add the oils when it is still wet after the pickle or do I wait for the hide to dry first??
42138,Roy,2007-03-02 16:51:00,13728,I'd guess that you'd be better off doing it before....
42208,douG,2007-03-02 19:52:00,2693,"When it's still wet after the pickle, we always wipe it off with kleenex before we do anything else."

42221,blackfly,2007-03-02 20:33:00,3,"I do all of my own tanning, mostly buckskins but some with hair on.  Go to braintan.com they have lots of articles there and you can get their book and video which is great.  I use ivory soap and neatsfoot oil to tan the hide and it comes out soft and white.  Bill"
42231,Fishandchips,2007-03-02 20:54:00,72,the secret to soft hides??? everyone knows its Jerkins lotion
42281,GbayGiant,2007-03-02 22:25:00,1780,undefined  This should help.
42288,JEREMY,2007-03-02 22:48:00,300,good one ccmt i was thinking the same thing.
42362,Greencoachdog,2007-03-03 00:49:00,8163,You could do it the old fashioned way and beat the pee-dadlin'-pee-yiss out of it with a stick...

42504,Greencoachdog,2007-03-03 11:28:00,8163,  Yup! Until they realized they could save thousands of $ on thier dental bills by beating it with a stick.
42548,jil101ca,2007-03-03 14:06:00,41,"Thanks Bill parker, ohiofisherman, Bill and Gbaygiant (have that site already book marked) and greencoachdog for your helpfull answers. Everyone else is a smartass lol  I can not find the neetsfoot oil although I haven't been to the trapper's store yet, I'll check there on Monday. I read that I could use any oil but that doesn't seem to be right, my furs are like playing with bacon.  The braintan.com site has alot of info there, thanks for the link. I have seem small reference to ivory soap but there is not much info about that. Could you give me some more details on the hows? Using actual brains is very unappealing to me.  Rabbit skins are very thin so beating them with a stick would turn them into mince meat (although it may work to soften hubby up)  As very chewing on them, I need you to go and show me how that works"
43015,blackfly,2007-03-04 19:45:00,3,"Jil101 Neatsfoot oil can be found in farm supply, harness shops, or even Home Hardware.  It is used for softening leather and cleaning tack.  The Ivory soap (1/4 bar) and the neatsfoot oil are mixed and used for tanning."
