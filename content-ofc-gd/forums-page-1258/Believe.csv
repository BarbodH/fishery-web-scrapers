42733,bpsbassman,2007-03-03 22:23:00,941,"Reading Davis Battah's post (see below) on the pinned ""Summer to Remember"" post got me to thinking.   I have added the word BELIEVE to my signature and urge others to do so as well. Everytime you read a post with it in the signature, it will be reminder for people to keep young Chris in their thoughts."

42808,Handlebarz,2007-03-04 00:52:00,3790,Hey Roger this does sound like a good thing you have brought up. Chris and the others need our thoughts everyday and this is a great reminder to us all that sometimes get caught up in our own lives and forget for a moment that there are others that realy need our thoughts.
