42814,007,2007-03-04 01:16:00,537,Hey all.  I'm thinking of booking weekend camping trips to Bonnechere and Silent Lake this year and wondered if anyone had fished these provincial parks?  What fish species can be caught there?  Can you shore fish or do you need a boat?  Boat rentals? Fishing Tips?  Also what time of year should I go for the best fishing?  I would be grateful for any advice you may have particularly on species and what time of year to go.  I had thought September or October but would consider June or August if the fishing is good at that time.  Thanks for your help.  007

We caught a few bass but the fishing was not that great. Its a very deep lake so maybe jigging is the way to go if your after Pickeral.

43285,jediangler,2007-03-05 13:43:00,1923,I used to camp at a private campground in between Round & Golden lakes. I found the best fishing was in the Bonnechere river between these lakes. Fish below the Tramore Dam or Tramore bridge for walleyes when season first opens. You can also fish the old Deacon bridge closer to Golden lake for pike and bass.
