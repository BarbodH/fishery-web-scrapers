43461,irishfield,2007-03-05 21:01:00,26272,"Every ""bus kid"" in Simcoe County, Honey Harbour and Parry Sound is stranded at school. Boards pulled all buses off the road...even though many had already pulled into their appropriate school yard for pick up. Gonna be a long night for them and whom ever is supervising...cause many parents aren't going to risk picking them up."
