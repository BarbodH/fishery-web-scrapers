The temperature doesn't look like it is going to rise enough until the closing to allow the huts to thaw out. Hopefully you can get out there to do that or it is going to be very tough getting those huts out later.   Rob C"

43157,irishfield,2007-03-05 01:57:00,26272,Remember to chip your blocks out and take them with you when you remove as well.  Weather is showing +4's for weekend and they are saying maybe even +10 for next week.

43163,Larry,2007-03-05 02:14:00,32,Do the MNR boys do a check of the lake for huts not removed.??
43164,tinbanger,2007-03-05 02:19:00,1028,I would hope so .Huts are reqistered (numbered) for that purpose. But There is a hut that has been washed up the south end of Cooks bay for several years now.  By the way ...Welcome Aboard Thirstystone!  TB
