42844,bucktail,2007-03-04 02:34:00,1857,The picture of the largemouth was reported to be around but no one ever saw it until lately. One thing is for sure...it sure looks 22 lbs. Great post.   Some more  WR Pike   Wr Brown    WR Walleye      Check this out too. Very cool http://www.fishing-worldrecords.com/
42850,Daplumma,2007-03-04 02:51:00,1961,"That there Salmon looks huge!I love some of those old fishin pics,the Tiger Muskie is priceless! Joe"
42858,GbayGiant,2007-03-04 03:12:00,1780,"I was looking for the Walleye, is that the 25lbs one from Tennessee ?"
42879,bucktail,2007-03-04 04:36:00,1857,the 25 lber was DQ'ed ... the new record is this 22.9 ( I think ) From Dale Hollow
42893,muskiebobsr,2007-03-04 06:03:00,49,That Tiger Muskie is from 1919 caught by John .Knobla.  I think that is the way it is spelled.  52 lbs something.
42894,muskiebobsr,2007-03-04 06:05:00,49,That Pike might be the one of of the New York Resevior.
42908,huntervasili,2007-03-04 09:44:00,1604,WOW... that bass looks like it could fit the kid in its mouth... Thanks for the pics... Some big fish there...
42950,glen,2007-03-04 14:38:00,2641,That's just what we needed.  Now we know what we are shooting for.  Thanks.
43028,GbayGiant,2007-03-04 20:50:00,1780,  Hey at least the Walleyes only 22lbs 9oz now instead of 25lbs.....
43032,Jigger,2007-03-04 21:26:00,1237, That pic is the WR from Germany.  The one out of New York is almost 10lbs off the mark... undefined Here is the link.
43212,ehg,2007-03-05 04:06:00,2666,"I think you are right Bucktail the old record was disqualified and this 22lb 9oz Bull Shoals walleye is now accepted.  Interestingly the Ontario record fish was a 22lb 4 oz from the Niagara. Not much smaller.  Personally i think there still is a world record walleye swimming in the lower niagara, L.Ont., and especially Lake Simcoe.  ehg"
43217,Bassman27,2007-03-05 04:21:00,98,Awesome pics!!!!Someday hopefully I'll get one close to that for Bass  Bassman
