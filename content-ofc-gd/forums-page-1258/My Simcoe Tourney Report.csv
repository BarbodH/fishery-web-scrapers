43137,Rizzo,2007-03-05 01:37:00,4754,"So I did manage to cart myself onto Kempenfelt bay Saturday afternoon to participate in the charity tournament.  Cost was $80.00 per hole with proceeds benefitting local charities (RVH Cancer Centre last year, Gilda's Club this year).  Didn't seem that cold at home, but man was I happy to have the survival suit on!  Now I understand why ""Tarpus Maximus"" has some problems on the ice...it gets mighty windy on Simcoe.  Even though I live 5 minutes away, I've never actually ice fished  Kempenfelt bay before.  To make things worse, I've never fished for whitefish or trout before either!  Stopped in at Simcoe Bait and Tackle to talk a little ""shop"" with the local experts.  Ended up meeting the guy who finished second in last years tourney and got a few  tips... pretty sure everyone lied to me I ended up with zero trout and precisely zero whitefish.  Fortunately, I did land a couple of  perch (out of 50 feet of water) and one was big enough to get me in the prizes.  I finished 48th out of approx. 500 people, winning $150.00 in ice fishing gear from Bass Pro.  Top 50 people got prizes.  Funny thing is, the guy in 50th place won an aluminum boat, guess I should have done a little worse!  Either way, a fun day and supporting great local charities. I'll definitely be back."

43146,irishfield,2007-03-05 01:44:00,26272,Good show Rizzo ! Great cause for sure and you made 2 to 1 odds to boot.  $150 for 48th and a boat for 50th
43148,ccmtcanada,2007-03-05 01:47:00,7971,Great job out there!  The winds were brutal today that's for sure.  Glad to hear you were in the prizes....and yes...I was a bit confused over a boat for 50th....oh well...all for a good cause
43149,Rizzo,2007-03-05 01:48:00,4754," ya, kind of funny how they did that.  Top 5 prizes were great, and then every once in a while there would be a great prize thrown in at a weird spot.  Made it kind of interesting actually, sometimes had you hoping they wouldn't call your name until you got to that better prize!"
43151,GbayGiant,2007-03-05 01:49:00,1780,"That's good nice 1, I like those tourneys I placed top 50 in the three I have went too and the same thing happened with the last finishing spot getting a very nice prize. Last one in Sudbury finished 44th with a 5"" perch at the buzzer."
43153,Rizzo,2007-03-05 01:52:00,4754," I think you're right.  Out from Minet's Point there are lots of huts, so I assume at least decent fishing.  I guess they do it at this location not for the fishing, but because of the southshore centre (parking, breakfast, lunch etc).  The rest of the ice season I never see anyone fish in this area so I'm pretty sure its not exactly a hotspot  ."
43159,Clampet,2007-03-05 02:00:00,1947,I'm very happy you WON something for your efforts Rizzo.
