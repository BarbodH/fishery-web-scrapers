43132,Northhunter,2007-03-05 01:28:00,214,"I have XM radio. Picked it up because I listen to a variety of music and the local FM radio stations were just ticking me off.  The receiver is a portable model, but I can only power it by plugging the adapter into a wall outlet or using the car attachment, which pops into a cigarette lighter.  It's a nice unit, but would be an awesome one if I could take it along on fishing excursions. The unit itself says 5V DC. The adapter lists INPUT: 100-120v -- 0.4A  50-60Hz  and OUTPUT: 5V -- 2.0A MAX  Is there any way I could power it off a battery for use in a boat, or at a campsite? They make a portable ""boombox"", but it runs close to $100 and has a lot of cons (looks, reception, battery life, etc.).  Anyone?"
43136,irishfield,2007-03-05 01:35:00,26272,Simplest...go to CTC and buy a lighter socket and attach to your battery or boat fuse panel. You say it works with a cig lighter adapter..so just use it everywhere.

I never leave home without one, they have helped me in the boat and car even powered my TV and DVD player for 4 hours when the hydro goes out."
43186,ccmtcanada,2007-03-05 03:06:00,7971,Ditto on the Poweboxes from Canadian Tire.  They are bascially bug batteries with inverters and outlets for household current.  You'll use it for everything from fishing trips to camping...and for powering radio's and such during power outages.  They are always on sale...so dont get one at regular price.
43232,Northhunter,2007-03-05 05:32:00,214,"Irish.. didn't even know I could do that!  I thaught about a portable unit.. but I fish out of smaller boats. With all the crap I already take with me (trolling motor, fishfinder, extra battery, multiple rods  etc., etc.) I don't think it would help keep the clutter factor down.. but I'll keep it in mind.  Thanks for the replies."
43353,irishfield,2007-03-05 16:33:00,26272, Just remember that the center post/terminal of the lighter socket goes to the + terminal on the battery
