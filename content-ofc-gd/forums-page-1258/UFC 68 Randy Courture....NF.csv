42890,Basskicker,2007-03-04 05:53:00,421,I'm speechless...New Heavyweight Champion...WOW!!  Jason
42891,Clampet,2007-03-04 05:57:00,1947,"Did he win over that huge dude, what's his name?"
42904,danbo,2007-03-04 09:26:00,2646,
42954,charlesn,2007-03-04 14:58:00,551,Unbelievable.  Inspiring.  Awesome!  A bigger upset than even any of the Pride 33 events but what a legend.  I guess they don't measure heart at the weigh-ins.  Charles
42978,Terry,2007-03-04 16:51:00,14456,"from the first punch, till the end Randy had control"
42985,Rob,2007-03-04 17:27:00,467,"He simply dominated Silvia. I am so glad to see him take that title from him. Now Randy will most likely have to defend his title against Cro Cop, that is going to be pretty ugly for Randy I think, that guy is a machine.  Rob C"
42989,Blake,2007-03-04 17:46:00,418,Great for Randy he has a lot of heart and is an increduble fighter.
43005,steverowbotham,2007-03-04 18:47:00,1800,one word .... wooooooooooooooooooooo!
43011,bucktail,2007-03-04 19:27:00,1857,Damn I knew I should have gone over to QB's and watched it. But I did win 96 bucks online playing poker so I ghuess I can't complain. Randy is awesome.
43035,RobHall,2007-03-04 21:38:00,261,"I've never been that impressed with Silvia.  However I must admit i did not give Couture much of a chance against Silvia.  Not a bad accomplishment for a 43 year old recently unretired MMA fighter.  How long he stays UFC Heavyweight Champ is another matter.  If Dana White can convince Fedor to come to the UFC, then things will get really interesting.  I don't see anyone that can stop this Russian monster.  FOTB "
43077,Clampet,2007-03-04 23:45:00,1947,Isn't Couture a French name?
43182,Grimace,2007-03-05 03:00:00,2020,couture is one of my favorites..    good to hear
43236,Dave Mercer,2007-03-05 05:58:00,148,Way To Go Randy! The best part is Randy love's Fishing! I am taking him out fishing this summer. I am pretty sure no one will move in on our spot that day.  Dave Mercer
