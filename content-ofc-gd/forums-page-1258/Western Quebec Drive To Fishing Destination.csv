42211,pooch,2007-03-02 20:04:00,139,"I am posting for a friend of mine. He's looking for a drive-to fishing destination in Western Quebec. He will be going with his father in-law, and a few brothers end of June this year (6 of them in total). They need meal plans, and are going for 3 nights 4 days. Walleye and Pike is what they are after.  If you are an operator, or have been to a lodge/resort/camp in western quebec and have any info to provide, that would be appreciated.  Thanks!"

I did get a chance to go to the fishing show this year and pick up the 2007 Quebec Outfitters Guide. They have the lodge listing for both fishing and hunting. You can get a free copy sent to you by calling the toll free # at 1-877-266-5687. While your at it, also be sure to ask for a free Quebec road map. If you know the area or region, tell them as they can give you more info."

42636,seanik,2007-03-03 18:00:00,38,"We have gone to the Gouin Reservoir 3 out of the past 4 years. The outfitter is "" Walleye Point"" they have a website, good fishing and accomodations that fit your needs. Be aware that most of the outfitters mentioned require extensive drives on gravel roads, the distance can be from 60 to 150 miles. As far as baits go, you can't go wrong trolling a gold or fire tiger jointed shad rap. We have great success with leeches or crawlers fished over the side on a bare hook or jig. If you need more information please email"
