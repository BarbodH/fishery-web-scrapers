43362,tbayboy,2007-03-05 17:00:00,1497,"Morning everyone, thought some of you might get a chuckle out of my newbieness (yes thats a word, I'm sure of it).  Based on some great advice from the board I headed out Sunday morning for a little solo adventure.  The morning started off fairly well, traffic was light and I flew along 7 then up the 400 and made a quick stop at fish ontario for some timmies and a scoop of minnows.  Hopped back on the 400 and 2 minutes later came to a stop as some brain trust had decided that putting three salters side by side across all 3 lanes instead of staggering them was a great idea.  Needless to say I spent the next 45 minutes crawling towards innisfil along with a couple miles worth of other happy drivers   .  Finally managed to get off the 400 and hit the ice, by that time it was 10:30 and I dragged the sled to a spot I'd heard would produce and chatted with a guy who was already out there.  When I asked how it was going he showed me his near blue hands and said he couldn't get a break long enough to warm his hands.  Awesome I thought and set up but realized I'd left the rod holders in the car.. no worries:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/410703844_25c8a54f38.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""IMG_0403"" /></a>    Quickly I had a few keepers including a double header so it looked like a good day was coming:   <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/151/410703812_7dc56075f5.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0401"" /></a>    The wind was really blowing along with some snow so things weren't the most comfortable but as long as the fish are biting I'm happy.  Of course you know where this is heading .... I quickly learned about the feeding cycle of simcoe perch - 11am and it just stopped. From then til 2:30 when I left I landed only one more keeper (and a few dinks).  Ah well, at least I had some fish for an evening snack and thats when the fun really begins - you see the last time I cleaned a fish I was so young my dad had to help.  Bring on the newbie report!  I figured I needed the  practice so I brought home 5 and did what all good fisherman do - I went to google and entered ""how to filet a perch""  After reading a few articles I was pretty sure I was an expert and setup in the kitchen.  After 1/2 hour this:   <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/188/410704003_971a035b78.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0407"" /></a>    Became   <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/123/410704052_aff5b4c969.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0408"" /></a>    Sigh  But I will say that by the last one I was getting better (or maybe it was because I saved the largest for last and it was easier to handle?). Anyhow, a quick batter/fry job and my huge meal was ready:   <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/410704268_18391de621.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0414"" /></a>    Luckily I knew exactly what to do next:   <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/42/410704169_8d45bc0cf9.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0411"" /></a>    Mmmm good filling pizza I mean perch - good filling massive perch, such a filling meal from such a master angler!  Hehe, anyhow, was a fun day and I'm sure I'll get better as I go.  Big thanks to Clampet for the advice over the weekend.  Here's the final 'I can feed millions with my fishing skills alone' shot:   <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/180/410704330_2ead3da09b.jpg"" width=""500"" height=""375"" alt=""IMG_0416"" /></a>  "
43367,Jen,2007-03-05 17:06:00,833,"What an amazing post... it makes me feel so much a part of this community, cause I have never had the courage to post my inadequacies when it comes to cleaning fish... perch are hard cause they wiggle when you are cutting them.. jk...  Glad to see the smile on your face in the last picture. It makes the whole day worth it!  Cheers Jen  P.S four of us spent the day on Simcoe with Hanks for whitefish and trout and didn't get a fish, so your meal looks like a feast from where I sit.  Well done!"
43369,PERCHER,2007-03-05 17:09:00,787,For a Newbie you did just great.Thanks for the report.Dan
43376,Mike Pike,2007-03-05 17:23:00,1332,What a great report there TBayBoy!!!  That was a terrific read and some great pics to go along with your tale!  Thank you.
43378,Clampet,2007-03-05 17:24:00,1947,"Ya did ok. Some fine tuning.. When the bite stopped, ya should of moved a little towards shore, make one hole, repeat till the little so an so's keep coming out of the hole.  The filleting you done isn't bad fer a newbie, way better than most, and those Perch look like they were a fair size."
43381,tbayboy,2007-03-05 17:35:00,1497,"Hehe Jen, you're not far from the truth ""perch are hard cause they wiggle when you are cutting them"" - my perchsicles thawed on the drive home and were still kicking on the cutting board - wasn't expecting that!.  Clampet - I thought about moving and when I left I tried one new hole closer to shore but the wind was pretty miserable (and no Tarpus of any size in sight!) so I didn't really feel like moving around a lot once I'd hunkered down - maybe next week."
43388,irishfield,2007-03-05 18:04:00,26272,Great report TBB ! Glad a successful first outing...I'm still shooting ZERO !
43389,Guest mistyriver1,2007-03-05 18:10:00,0,Great read and nice report.
43431,LeXXington,2007-03-05 20:17:00,1928,"Great Report,  Good to see you going out again, braver than me    How did the new auger go?  I have had a perch, in a bucket (no water) got it home put them in some water to clean them prior to the filit and the little dudes started swimming...  Perch cleaning is really easy you just need them to all be 13""  :)"
43480,tbayboy,2007-03-05 21:29:00,1497,"New auger was great Lexx -  I couldn't believe how easy it worked (smaller size + brand new blades probably helped a lot compared to yours last week), fin bore micro - very happy with it.  I was talking to the other guys and no one was getting big ones - quantity over quality kinda day I guess.  If the weather forecast for this weekend is actually right (3degrees and sun) I'll give it another go but if its windy like this weekend I may take a pass - that was getting pretty miserable by the time I left.  Of course the bite dying off didn't help make the weather seem better either.  By 2pm I was starting to realize why you and others spend the money on those portable shelters"
43483,Joey,2007-03-05 21:37:00,9122,Great report.  I'm not the best a perch fileting either.  They just seem so small and hard to manage.  You did a fine job.  Joey
43543,Bly,2007-03-05 23:21:00,1556,Great report and with fish even!  hehe   Good for you!!  bly
43584,tinbanger,2007-03-06 00:10:00,1028,Glad to hear you made it out and even caught fish !!  Fillets look great .  Maybe see you out there some day  TB
43595,Rizzo,2007-03-06 00:37:00,4754,"nice report, I love the pizza box, too funny"
43599,tbayboy,2007-03-06 00:47:00,1497,"Hey TB and anyone else I'm always looking for partners (none of my friends in the GTA are into fishing, just my buddies back in Thunder Bay) so if anyone ever needs someone to split the costs or just wants some company that will make them look like a pro then I'm your man, just don't ask me to clean the fish at the end of the day"
