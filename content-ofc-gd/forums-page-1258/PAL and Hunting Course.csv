43266,lilkynan,2007-03-05 12:51:00,173,To those who advised me to go to the Wolfs Den for taking my courses - thank you. Done successfully on the weekend.  TY
43271,Motorhead,2007-03-05 13:07:00,163,congrats on passing....  I`m just curious on how much it cost you to take the courses??   Doug
43275,Corey,2007-03-05 13:22:00,355,"When I looked into everything, for me to take the non-restricted course & test, the restricted course and test, and the hunter safety course and test, including books for all, it was $311 for the whole thing. The prices do vary from place to place. I believe the non-restricted stuff and hunter safety stuff is around $240 on its own.  I ended up challenging the 2 firearms tests, which you can do for $30 each. The hunter safety course you have to take in Ontario unless you have had a hunters license in another ""recognized"" place. Like another country or province."
43373,lilkynan,2007-03-05 17:18:00,173,Total for PAL and Ontario Hunting was $220  And they do it over a 2 day period in one weekend - was long but weel done
43374,Jen,2007-03-05 17:19:00,833,"So , did you bring home the test ???  JK, well done , it is on my list of things ""to do""  Have my restricted and non restricted fire arms, just have to book the hunting...grrr"
43380,misfish,2007-03-05 17:32:00,29133,Yep they run a great place there. Congrats.  Now for that turkey course
43382,Chuck Best,2007-03-05 17:36:00,308,"Yup,you got it Mis....I'm signed up for the turkey course at Georgian College Mar. 25......along with my sister in law and a buddy....."
43383,trapshooter,2007-03-05 17:37:00,1234,"I hear ya brian, I'm taking the Wild Turkey seminar in London this April.  I would encourage everyone to take this course as well as the hunter safety.  If you decide down the road to hunt or get into the shooting sports you will already have the licences needed."
43384,lilkynan,2007-03-05 17:40:00,173,I am also taking the Turkey course at Georgian on March 25 - see you there
43390,ch312,2007-03-05 18:14:00,1590,over 300 bucks!?!?  when i did my PAL and hunting courses 5-6 years ago it was something like $65 for each one plus $20 per book. i passed the courses and got all my licenses for 350 or so....  now you're looking at $130 i think for 3 year small game and fishing plus i think its $60 for a PAL?  what do you plan on buying for your first gun?
43391,Cookslav,2007-03-05 18:20:00,1457,"Did the Turkey course last year,  She's a bit dry, lotts focus on safety (good thing IMO) And a lot of upselling of product LOL... But I'm glad I got it done."
43408,Corey,2007-03-05 19:18:00,355,"The $311 includes the restricted as well, and like I said, rates do vary. And yes, it's another $60 or $80 for the PAL or RPAL. The place I did my tests and hunter course charges $235 for just the non-restricted and hunter safety course.  I have 2 guns now... Remington 870 Wingmaster with a 20"" slug barrel and a 28"" vented rib barrel with removable chokes. I also have an Anschutz .22 target gun.  I signed up for the turkey course in Hamilton in April.  cd."
