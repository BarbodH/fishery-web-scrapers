I have to go to work now...If you're in Bradford maybe you could get a copy and post it?  Thanks  Maureen"

Still waiting for the lady from the times to e-mail me what she had.  Come to think of it I will check with a friend of mine who lives in Bradford.  As for it's continued growth, that has more to do with the great folks here than anything I've done.  Maureen"
