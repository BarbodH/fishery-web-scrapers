43497,sturgman,2007-03-05 22:18:00,249,How much was the ante? Sounds like fun. Are you guys doin it again this year?
43502,steve_paul,2007-03-05 22:24:00,658,"sturgman - was a lot of fun.  everyone agreed to send the winner a $20 lure at the end.  puckhead won it all this year, hopefully it gets set up again next season - was a fun way to follow the season last year."
43578,Puckhead,2007-03-05 23:57:00,377,"Was great fun.  Will post all the winnings once we finally get them all in.  BTW - Jamie, that was classy sending a $25 GC instead of the $20.  You didn't need to do that but it's appreciated!"
43579,Crazyhook,2007-03-06 00:02:00,1154,"I was late with everythig going on.. figured it was a bit of fishing tackle interest.  We will do it again next year, everyone has to pay up though!  Maybe we can have someone look over the prizes or something. It was alot of fun, I enjoyed picking guys then dropping them only to have them have a career game ! it makes all the game sinteresting, I made a point of taking a Sunday night and Monday night player so I had to watch the games!"
