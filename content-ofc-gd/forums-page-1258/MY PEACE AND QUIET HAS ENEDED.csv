Bly and I went scouting to a few tribs Saturday afternoon, but didn't like what we saw...but then again, what do we know?? haha.  We were thinking about it today, but family stuff got in the way...then the winds picked right up.  Since we dont know the good places to go, we decided to stay at home.  Serves us right..LOL  Awesome pics...cant wait to get out again...oh yeah...you wanted -20....looks like you'll get that Tuesday and Wednesday...go crazy out there!!! LOL"
