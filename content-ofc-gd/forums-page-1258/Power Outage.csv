41996,Woodsman,2007-03-02 09:29:00,1286,Anyone else without power? Woke up about 3:30 and all was dark and starting to get cool. No power = furnace no work. Only heat I got is a one burner propane stove. Also with no power the water pump is out.  Rick
41998,SlowPoke,2007-03-02 09:38:00,2984,No interuptions here in south London. It's likely ice pulling lines down in your area. -Brian
42002,lew,2007-03-02 10:07:00,12767,"Still plenty of power here in East York, but there's a heavy coating of ice on everything and strong winds, so it may only be a matter of time before the branches come down and take the hydro lines with them.  Just to add to the fun, it's raining pretty hard now too."
42003,motv8tr,2007-03-02 10:17:00,2587,"Power's good up here, but if it goes I'm ok, happens usually twice a year around these parts.  I use a wood stove, so I still have heat, and can cook, lot's of battery operated lights.  There are apparently several areas in T.O. that are out due to downed lined.  Be careful everyone.  Maureen"

42776,irishfield,2007-03-03 23:55:00,26272,Lap top and phone line!
42941,Woodsman,2007-03-04 13:39:00,1286,"Exactly. Dial up here and I did not lose the the phone service. Laptop recharged by power inverter, powered by my boat battery which was in the basement fully charged. Inverter only puts out 2.6 amps max continuously. Too small to power anything big. Most people in the area now have there power back. Further west closer to Lake Huron there is still some without power.  Best Wishes: Rick"
