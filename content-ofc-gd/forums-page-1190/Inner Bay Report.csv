88373,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-06-27 13:46:00,34,"Well I launched out of longpoint and we were not disapointed.  Our day started at 6:30 where we took off from Brantford and ended up in the water just after 8:00a.m. It was already getting HOT  The day started on the first drift with a nice 3.7lb bucket mouth on a carolina rig set up. A couple more drifts with only small dink size perch. So we decided to head over to bait island EC6  I was amaized at the amount of boat traffic there on a tuesday morning. I must have seen 50+ boats all fishing bass. We watched numerous people catching fish. I wasnt having the same luck. We changed our set up to Mepp's silver #3, #4, #5 and the action kicked off for a couple more quick fish.  2:00 it was time for a swim in the cold Erie waters (that didnt last very long). Then back to our original drift near our launch point. We wouldnt you know it the Pike were in and hitting hard. A couple nice 35"" and 32"" fish were caught my buddy Pete and we called it a day.   My first experience fishing the Inner Bay of Erie on my own was a great time and a great success.  Looking forward to more challenges."

88420,Fly Me In Scotty,2007-06-27 15:49:00,34,I cant think of the name now (DOH)...  It was just as I was entering into Long Point and I seen the sign $10.  I was itchin to hit the water so we jumped on it.  Thanks for the advice
