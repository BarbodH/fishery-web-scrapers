88268,Meely,2007-06-27 02:53:00,282,"Got some vacation time booked for the 3rd week in August. Planning on getting away for the week up north somewheres. I have no idea where to go. As I only have a week, I'm ideally looking to drive 10 - 15 hours . Hoping to see if these 100 fish a day I see on some of these shows holds true. Looking to target pics and hopefully Musky. Do you guys have any suggestions ??  Thanks in advance,  Meely"

88302,Big Cliff,2007-06-27 09:11:00,6899,Biscotasing? I don't know if you will get 100 fish a day without doing a fly in to some remote lake but Biscotasing is beautiful and has some good numbers of fish. It would be within your range of 10 - 15 hours.

88360,TJQ,2007-06-27 13:17:00,7806,Are ya looking to camp.. or at a cottage??
88394,Meely,2007-06-27 14:39:00,282,Prolly cottage........
88398,TJQ,2007-06-27 14:55:00,7806,Hmm... I dont think theres much muskie fishing north of nipissing.
88408,Meely,2007-06-27 15:07:00,282,Looking to target pics mostly. What are the chances on pics and pike???  THanks  Meely
88411,TJQ,2007-06-27 15:16:00,7806,"Pics and pike are almost a given together...  for the numbers your looking at... likely Lady Evelyn, Chapleau or Gowganda  http://www.ontariofishing.net/linkspages/F...ogama_Gowganda/  http://www.ontariofishing.net/linkspages/F.../Wawa_Chapleau/  http://www.ontariofishing.net/linkspages/F...yn_Smoothwater/"
88415,Meely,2007-06-27 15:28:00,282,Thanks TJ. I'm totally lost as which one to choose. Can anyone make a recommendation?? I might as well throw darts ! Thanks for any help  Meely
88417,TJQ,2007-06-27 15:41:00,7806,well...  I can't reccomend any.. that would be a conflict of interest...  but someone here should..
88712,Nanook,2007-06-28 03:12:00,565," Cant believe Lakair Lodge has'nt been suggested ! If you find the 'spots', all the Pike you want and Walleye too. There are Muskie around I hear.  The cabins look to be efficient,clean, and roomy.  Your Host's, Kevin and Leslie, are the nicest, laid back, people you could meet. Boat rentals are available, or dockage for your own.  I'd recommend this Lodge, in a flash.   Mods ! this is not intended to be Spam"
