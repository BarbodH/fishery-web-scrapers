88128,steve_paul,2007-06-26 21:01:00,658,It's a good day to sell air conditioning
88130,aniceguy,2007-06-26 21:07:00,1094,"I hear you it sure did honk waking up to a 70 degree house and in my ac'ed car all day...Only to come home with wifey handing me an ice cold pint that was in the freezer for 4 hours...only to find 3 more in the exact same location..... Then going for a swim  before dinner.. But I do agree my son plays baseball tonight and as long as the kids are extremly hydrated they all should be fine.. I play ball at 8 and Im not looking forward to that.... At least I can run to my car between innings and chill out a bit.......as long as the kids or anyone is sweating and the water intake ( not sugar drinks and not even gatorade)  is of adequate quantaties they should be ok, just watch for a lack of sweating lethargy with some minor motor trembling....Then there is a problem.."
88219,lloyd,2007-06-27 00:42:00,16,"Hi All,  Well all I can say is it is nice to be away from the heat and the job. I retired on May 31 after spending 39 years at Stelco working in the Machine Shop. I dont miss the place but I do miss the guys. Best wishes and good fishing to all. Sarmoti))))))))))))))))"
88227,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-27 01:12:00,0,I heard in Europe its like 45+ degrees and 46 or so people died with many more fainting in the streets....
88234,fishergirl72,2007-06-27 01:26:00,455, Well what do we have here? LOL   a pool? I am coming over Tracey!LOL
88305,nautifish,2007-06-27 09:42:00,1416,"LOL Julie....Well get your tooksih down here grl........ Yes Europe is being hit hard romania especially, Six deaths now due to the intence heat. My mom just returned to the UK sunday night and went back to very heavy rains & floods. The north of England has had the wettest june on record,Sheffeild is flooded and there are now concerns that a dam just outside rotherham is going to give way. Its really bad over there i have seen some bad floods up in north yorkshire in York especially but nothing like what is happening now."
88315,dsn,2007-06-27 10:50:00,1018,"Helped my brother move yesterday. Boy was it hot. It was nuts. I had to leave my building and walk over to his and in between was a school. The teachers where out with some of the kids. As I walked by I over heard the teacher saying ""OK when you run or jog and become hot or feel dizzy and need a break go to one of the teachers or inside to cool off. If you need water there's a place to get cold water. As I kept walking I saw this big shiney BBQ grill!!!  Thought to myslef wow these kids aren't doing that bad out here at all. It was around 9:30am in the morning. Wish I was having a BBQ.  So you see the school takes care of them very well. least this one does. My neice goes to this school. I thought she might be outside but I didn't see her.  Least today the temps are abit better.  dsn"
88325,hawkeye,2007-06-27 11:58:00,162,"The guy I really feel sory for is my roofer. He starts this morning and is looking at 2 days of work in this heat. Well maybe this afternoons thunderstorms will cool it off somewhat. Me I got a data centre with 40 tons of A/C here at work, make a great beer cooler too"
88334,Mike the Pike,2007-06-27 12:17:00,3421,No problem summer is not very long anyone want to return to this    MTP
88359,dsn,2007-06-27 13:17:00,1018,   Aahh nice and refreshing. No thanks.    dsn
88002,dsn,2007-06-26 16:24:00,1018,Wow the tempture is brutal with the humidex today. I'm lookin at the weather eye and it says that the GTA is 32 degrees not including the humidex. With the humidex it feels like 40 degrees. The winds are at 17 km.  I'm looking at the island temp it's 24 degrees with the humidex the island is at 31 degrees. Hardly any winds. Only 7km winds.   What a difference. I think its time to hit the island and stay there the entire day. Much cooler.  dsn
88005,fishergirl72,2007-06-26 16:26:00,455,"Yes it is brutal, you got that right, at these times I am so glad that we live in a basement apartment"
88006,Roy,2007-06-26 16:30:00,13728,I hear ya. Low forties here this afternoon. Let the kids play outside this morning and have their lunch out in the yard. Back inside in air conditioned comfort this afternoon.
88008,ccmtcanada,2007-06-26 16:34:00,7971,"It's a steamer out there for sure!! Even yesterday, bly and I tried to fish for a bit during the day.  We didn't last too long....hardly even a breeze!  If anyone goes out there, make sure you have TONS of water and keep your head covered!"
88012,Terry,2007-06-26 16:48:00,14456,the old A/C is running full tilt here at work
88014,Zamboni,2007-06-26 16:49:00,235,Can't believe their not cancelling my sons soccer game-kids are gonna die running in this heat.
88016,fishergirl72,2007-06-26 16:53:00,455," Yes, you would think that they would cancel it due to the VERY HIGH temps.   It's not good for the young or old to be out in the heat, nevermind running in it."
88019,OhioFisherman,2007-06-26 16:54:00,6623,"Inside day for me here, I am melting! With the MS I don`t handle the heat well."
88020,ccmtcanada,2007-06-26 16:56:00,7971, Oh yeah...and also that little thing called a Smog Advisory!!  That's that thing where they warn people to limit their outdoor activities...jeez.
88025,Hooked,2007-06-26 17:07:00,891,"Left my central air run all night last night, woke up to a cozy 74.  Unfortunately I had to go to work, and its unbelievably hot and humid even in the shade.  Feel sorry for those people like GCD that gotta work outside in this crap, especially with work gear on, uhhh."
88029,fishergirl72,2007-06-26 17:09:00,455," I hear ya Cliff, I am surprised that there are not certain ""rules"" for extreme heat or cold temps. There should be, maybe that would lessen the volume on our emergency rooms that they are always complaining about!"
88031,Zamboni,2007-06-26 17:13:00,235,"Worst part is he's new to soccer-hockey is his game. He runs 5 times as much as other kids, comes all way back while playing forward....tries to make end to end rushes few times game     I put him in soccer for conditioning so we didn't speak playing his position-may be time."
88033,fishergirl72,2007-06-26 17:16:00,455," Boy, that is sure alot of running for a little boy, but I am sure that he loves playing, I bet you are debating if you should let him play tonight or not, can you do that? I am not to sure how these sports work, or do you have to show up on a particular game night?"
88045,Zamboni,2007-06-26 18:05:00,235,No way I can keep him home-he'd make our lives miserable. I'll speak with coach about sitting him more/my concerns.....soccer parents are as serious as hockey parents I'm finding out-possibly more.
88046,POLLIWOGG,2007-06-26 18:07:00,835,"They say there is enough heat generated from TO's blacktop to create a thunderstorm, I hope so, we could use the rain.  I wonder if anyone has done a study what contributes more to global warming , the family car or the paved drive it sits on?  Don't worry, Kids self regulate, If you treat them like someone with a bad heart they will end up someone with a bad heart."
88048,Nanook,2007-06-26 18:15:00,565," I got work to do outside,but in heat/humidity?; the heck with it, it'l wait 'til I'm ready. Even too hot for fishing for me!  Aint it grand when you can pick and choose"
88053,snoil,2007-06-26 18:32:00,139,I'd rather be miserable at home then miserable waiting at the ER because of heat stroke.
88058,Fish Farmer,2007-06-26 18:43:00,2234,"Let the kid play. When we were kids we played outside and we never had AC. At the end of the day, we still never wanted to go in. Bring back the good old days when kids were kids."
88059,misfish,2007-06-26 18:45:00,29133,"Well I dont mean to get ya,ll upset,but the factory is fully AC,yep all 80,000 sq feet. It,s a real killer walking to the truck  ,then home and back to the comforts of AC. Oh and the beer is cold too."
88066,Nemo,2007-06-26 18:56:00,727,misfish you get beer at work! Nice..
88069,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-26 19:04:00,2585,im out in leamington on business and its 33 41 with the humid x.  what a nice cool early summer day lol  CHeers!
88074,HookNrelease,2007-06-26 19:18:00,85,"our plant is 70,000Sq.ft, and we have approx 30,000 sq.ft of powder coat ovens running at 450F for 18 hours a day, PLUS our 17 stages of pre-treatments which are like a drive through car wash, we run outside to cool down and dry off,,,hahahahhahah, its funny how you can get used to certain things, but yes its certainly hot today"
88082,aplumma,2007-06-26 19:34:00,6896,HA now arn't you all sorry you keep pumping that cold air down here this spring. You thought you all would be funny by keeping our summer heat hostage so us poor southerners would suffer alittle more cold weather now look at what it got you.......This will learn yaaa not to mess with the Southern Contingency.   The Southern contingency local chapter 101
88092,misfish,2007-06-26 19:49:00,29133,"Pay backs are a b atch my southern friend. You just wait til next year,we,ll teach ya to talk back.  Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
