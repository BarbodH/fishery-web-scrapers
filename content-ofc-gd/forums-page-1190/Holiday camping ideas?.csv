Hopefully within 2-3 hours of GTA and with good fishing. Place where I could go in with my SUV pulling my boat behind. My wife nailed me with the question ""what are we doing for the holidays and I didn't know what to answer I know, I know.......I am always late with planning but had to deal with all kinds of higher priority tasks. Feel free to PM me. Thank you.  Ice Fisherman"
