87638,fishergirl72,2007-06-25 21:37:00,455,"Well now that fishing season is into high gear, so is the end of the school year.   Last Friday was Angelina's FIRST graduation into Grade 1!  And what a busy day it was because after the end of the day we were headed up north for the weekend. We were so proud of her that day. She has come a long way in the last 2 years! It is unbelieveable to what they learn in 2 years. Dad (Fishindevil) took the pics and of course mom was in the audience shedding a few tears.   And today after she came home from school, she found a BRAND NEW bike in her bedroom!   She did not know anything about it and she was so surprised when she saw that shiny bike and we told her it was for graduating and doing so well in school! She is in her glory right now and has not come back in the house since.LOL. Here are some pics of her graduation and her new bike that we wanted to share with all of you!              "

87803,fishergirl72,2007-06-26 02:42:00,455,"Thanks guys!  And Smokey, yes she ALWAYS wears her helmut, if not she DOES NOT EVER ride without it and if she does, she loses her bike for a couple of days, I am very strict about safety."

87916,ccmtcanada,2007-06-26 12:58:00,7971,Great post Julie.  They do grow up too fast dont they?  You mentioned being proud of her...and you should be...she's a GREAT little girl.  The smile on her face really tells the story though.  Congrats on a wonderful milestone!
87923,Smokey,2007-06-26 13:11:00,1278,Great rule. I see too many kids with injuries that could have been prevented by wearing one.
87967,tonyb,2007-06-26 15:21:00,1637,"Proud moments indeed!  Sorry dad, but holy, does she ever look like mom! She'll be outfishing you guys in no time."

87981,fishergirl72,2007-06-26 15:42:00,455,"We have been told that she does look like a ""mini"" mom,LOL. And for her outfishing us, I wouldn't doubt it, all weekend she would NOT come off the dock, she wanted to fish, she wore us out.LOL"

88026,fishergirl72,2007-06-26 17:07:00,455," Yeah I knew that car would catch some attention,LOL I wish it was mine but it is the guy next door that owns it.   he really takes care of it but hardly drives it, and it does not have one scratch on it."
