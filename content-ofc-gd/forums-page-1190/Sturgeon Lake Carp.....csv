88866,fliptheslop,2007-06-28 17:19:00,112,"Hers some facts: FRom the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service  The exact locatin and year of introduction of common carp, Cyprinus carpio, is unknown, but sources from Fuller(1999) say the common carp came from Eurasia for use as a food fish. Sources report that the common carp was transported to the U.S. around 1831 from France into New York, into Connecticut in the 1840s, in1872 from Germany into California, and in 1877 from Germany into several states in the U.S. The international release and escape of carp into several other water bodies has also helped this species to multiply in almost every state except Alaska. The common carp can thrive in lakes, rivers, and streams and is a well known bottom feederthat roots up vegetation and stirs up sediment on the bottom of water bodies. This creates poor water clarity and light penetration for other fish. Common carp are very produtive spawner and can over populate an area rapidly. Fishermen see the common carp as a nuisance fish because it depletes good fishing habitat and crowds out sport fish.  And contrary to what you believe it is a fact CARP DO EAT FISH EGGS.  Photz before you go calling someone stupit maybe you should get the facts, but im sure an expert like yourself has all the facts and knows that carp are great for our lakes, so that gives you the right to call someone else stupit. So I guess if having a clue as to the adverse affects carp are having on our lakes that your right IM as stupit as they come.  And I dont care what the brits do, I care about the lakes in CANADA and the carp are hurting them.  So with that said, I can find all kinds of info that shows carp are not good for lakes, do me a favor and show me how much smarter you are and lets have a little info on why carp are good for our lakes. And quoting a bunch of mags from Britian that are trying to sell people trips to Canada for thousands of dollars aint to scientific, But hey Im the stupit one"
88867,ccmtcanada,2007-06-28 17:25:00,7971,"I dont have a problem one way or another when it comes to Carp. Do I fish for them...yes...why? Because they are there. Some anglers I have talked to will kill any carp that they catch because they believe that they are ""destroying"" the fishing in their area. I'm not one to just kill anything based on one person's word, so I have been doing some searching on the web and although there very few studies when it comes to common carp, there are a few interesting things that have come up.  Carp are non-native fish to say the Great Lakes...that is true...but so are chinook salmon, rainbow trout, brown trout and coho salmon. They were all, carp included, introduced intentionally by man....dating back to 1879. The ironic thing is that it was one of the US Fish Commission's mandates back then to raise and release them into the waterways....now the Fisheries are trying to figure out how to control/eradicate them in certain areas.  General concensus is that common carp are regarded as a nuisance species. They uproot vegetation and lower the visibility in waters, potentially driving out native species. In areas like Hamilton Harbour, the Carp are seen as a big problem in trying to restore the area. In reading studies on Hamilton watershed area, I found it interesting that it was because of man that species like the Carp are thriving there. It all had to do with the urbanization of the area in the early 1900's that made Hamilton Harbour prime carp breeding grounds. Bad watershed management back then effectively drove out native species....the carp just ""moved in"".  There is another site that studied the common carp and the zebra mussel problem. It found that Carp ""clearly demonstrate the ability of the common carp to prey on zebra mussels"". Here's the quick summary of that study...  Zebra mussel predation by common carp F. Cronin, J. Tucker, D. Soergel INHS researchers examined gut contents from 31 common carp collected at Mississippi River Mile 217 in August 1995 for evidence of predation on zebra mussels. We found between 1 and 407 zebra mussel beaks in 83.9% of the fish we examined. For all fish examined, common carp contained 118.2 beaks per fish or about 59 zebra mussels per fish. We found that large fish tend to prey more on larger zebra mussels than do small fish. These preliminary results clearly demonstrate the ability of the common carp to prey on zebra mussels. Considering that common carp are numerous in the Illinois and Mississippi rivers, they may have had an effect on zebra mussel demographics.  More interesting info on invasive species can be found at http://www.marinebio.com/Oceans/Conservation/Moyle/ch10.asp  So the question that has NEVER been answered...are they detrimental overall to the fisheries? No one knows because they have been here for so long!! 128 years...and still here after attempts to eradicate it from North America. True scientific studies didn't happen back in the early to mid 1800s...so there is not really any ""base' to start from. The way I look at it, if the OFAH includes them in the Angler Awards as a sportfish, then I'll return them when I catch them, since the OFAH are supporters of catch and release.  Anyhow, just wanted to put up a ""non biased"" view of carp. Bottom line for me is that the carp thing is just another example of how ""man"" thought we could control our environment by introducing new species to an ecological area without understanding the implications of those actions. Will we ever learn????  Feel free to jump all over me on this one...haha."

88871,Photoz,2007-06-28 17:31:00,792,"When conjuring up 'FACTS' you could at least get your information correct . . . .     get someone to read this too ya! Yeah . . . .    I'd say I got you pretty well pegged!  HISTORY OF CARP IN THE UNITED STATES  Prior to 1900, most native fish were viewed as vital food resources. Fish designated as sport fish today were harvested commercially and shipped by rail to the cities. The results were gravely declining stocks of river and lake fish at a time the U.S. population was greatly expanding.  In 1871, Ulysses S. Grant and Congress ordered the formation of the U.S. Fish Commission to oversee the nation's fisheries interests. By 1877 the studies of European fish farming techniques indicated the carp would contribute to the strength of the nation.  By 1874, the commission after long study issued a report entitled, ""Fishes Especially worthy of Cultivation.""  It went on to say that no other species except the carp promises so great a return in limited waters. Cited were advantages over such fish as black bass, trout, grayling and others ""because it is a vegetable feeder, and although not disdaining animal matters can live on vegetation alone and can attain large weight kept in small ponds and tanks.""  In 1876, the commission enumerated other good qualities such as high fecundity (a count of ripe eggs in the female fish), adaptability to artificial propagation, hardiness of growth, adaptability to environmental conditions unfavorable to equally palatable species, rapid growth, harmlessness in relation to fish of other species, ability to populate waters to it's greatest extent and fine table qualities.  By 1877, citing the above reasons and adding, 'there is no reason why time should be lost with less proved fishes,"" the commission, convinced of the value of carp, imported 345 fishes of scaled, mirror and leather carp from German aqua culturists.  On May 26th, they were placed in the Druid Hill Park ponds in Baltimore, Maryland.  The ponds proved inadequate and some were transferred to the Babcock lakes on the monument lot in Washington, D.C. the following year.  So did they somehow escape from these confines to populate nearly everywhere?  No.  Now state governments get involved.  Records indicate about 6,203 fingerlings were produced in the Babcock lakes in 1879.  These were shipped to 273 applicants in 24 states.  About 6,000 fingerlings were produced in the Druid Hill ponds that year and were stocked primarily in Maryland.  One year later, 31,332 carp were shipped to 1,374 applicants.  In 1882, carp production increased to 143,696 fish and distributed in small lots to 7,000 applicants.  In 1883, about 260,000 carp were sent to 9,872 applicants in 298 of 301 congressional districts and to 1,478 counties.  During the years 1879 to 1896, the U.S. Fish Commission distributed 2.4 million carp, some of which were sent to Canada, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Mexico.  By 1897, the Commission discontinued the stocking because carp had been distributed nearly everywhere and many states assumed the task of propagation and stocking of carp."

IM done go catch your carp take a nice picture and throw them back (cus they arnt good for nothing) and let them live longer and cause more damage  And my facts were a direct quote from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, but I guess they are stupit to and they just hate carp I guess  the problem is my reading is just fine and I have the mantality to be able understand,but hey go with the name calling and such cus it really seems to be the only come back someone that doesnt have a clue resorts to, good thing I get it or I would have to act like a 2 year old as well"

I was under the impression that the reason the brits fished for carp is because they fished out all of the good species of fish... Sure, we should encourage them to come over and fish for carp.  Just keep it quiet that we still have some fish left that are actually worth fishing for.  Okay, fire away."
88928,Hellfish,2007-06-28 19:44:00,308,"    HAHAHAH that was good,  not much of a opinion here, other than a carp is a fish thats all that matters to me they might be destructive but i dont know enough either way but it seems this has just turned into a pissing match"
88661,crappieperchhunter,2007-06-28 00:06:00,2582,Sinker you have a good point. How many others have already fished the Kawartha's and hauled there potentionally infected boat out to fish somewhere else the next day or the next weekend.  Scary stuff.  Personally I really enjoy carping so I have a hard time reading others comments who are trashing carp.  All I can do is promise that if the same fate befalls a species of fish that others  enjoy fishing for I will not be posting anywhere how happy I am to see there enjoyment taken away from them. What kind of a sportsman's wish is that? Sometimes you just have to read comments from others and not even meet them to know what they are made of...or what they are lacking.  I don't wish to see anyone's fishery ruined...so I hope this mess gets figured out soon so it disrupts the enjoyment of as few of us as possible. I'm sure most of us would wish for more time spent fishing instead of less.  That is my wish as well.  Good luck on the water to all.
88673,MJL,2007-06-28 00:47:00,2427,"As far as common carp go, they seem fairly benign compared to the ones that jump 6' into boats.  If it is a virus, what's there to stop it from mutating and hitting other species (which some have in the past)?  If you fish the Kawartha region, I'd be worried.  Personally, I find some of the reasons why people dis-like carp interesting.  Some of the ones I've heard over the years""  1. ""15yrs ago the fishing was awesome...The carp ruined it for all of us"" Reply ""You do realize that carp have been in here since the 1800's""  2. ""Carp have eroded away the shoreline all along the Otonabee"" Reply ""Are you talking about those boats over there that speed through the channels and create all these wakes""...""You're right look how much dirt was washed away when that one sped through""  3. ""Carp don't taste good"" Reply ""Don't eat them then""  4. ""Carp are eating all the weeds!"" Reply ""Maybe that's not such a bad thing...Just look at your prop...And his...And their's""  As far as government conspiracies, it won't be the first time someone has used chemicals to control carp...It's called rotenone.  Being the carp nut that I am...Perhaps it's best to remain optimistic about the situation.  Some research has stated that carp die-offs (natural, man-assisted, man-assisted accidents) can be beneficial to the species where only 1 or 2 strong year classes of fish may dominate a lake (for decades) and as those fish age, the spawning potential and general quality of fish declines.  In 10 or so years, Scugog may be the great carp fishery that it once was with a quality head of fish."
88676,Sinker,2007-06-28 00:57:00,8692,"I don't really care what kind of fish are dead.....dead fish is not a good thing any way you slice it. I don't fish carp at all, but I'm sure its fun. I have caught a few, but never actually targetted them. If I lived in the city, and that's what I had access to, I'd be a carp addict as well....there's no doubt in my mind!! I just have to fish.....species doesn't matter!!  I think the rotenone kills all fish....anything with gills. If that was put in scugog, we'd be seeing all kinds of dead fish. Maybe the MNR was just doing some  elecro fishing to get a count on fish?  Who knows.......certainly not me.....but it stinks (no pun intended)....and I hope it will just be a virus that will pass in due time, and leave us some  good tough carp for you carp guys....  Sinker"
88695,fliptheslop,2007-06-28 01:54:00,112,"A true sportsman knows enough that when one species gets to the numbers that the carp have it is time that something is done about them, to think that the carp in the numbers that they are now at, have no effect on the lakes and other species is foolish. And sorry but I for one dont want to fish with 40 foot poles you put together, buzzers, rod holders, and corn slingshots, so as a true sportsman I say the bigger the carp die off the better for our lakes, they will never be wiped out, but they must be controlled,and maybe mother nature is feeling the same way and just doing a little population control."
88699,crappieperchhunter,2007-06-28 02:16:00,2582,I have no idea what there numbers are or how they effect....or if... they effect other species. Seems you are an expert. Please share some proven information. I for one would like to see it.  If you can't then I have to assume you are one of those people my dad always warned me about....the ones who just like talking to hear the sound of there own voices...Seems to me if you are going to stand on your soap box and preach you should at least have some sort of proof to back up the jibber jabber.
88718,lazybum,2007-06-28 03:48:00,142, Many of us do fishing in general for the enjoyment aspect of it rather than to become be a true sportsman.  And really how many is too many to have an adverse impact. What scientific stiudies have you done to support that.  Also consider what the impact will be on the tourism business if you wipe out all the carp as you suggested.
88825,fliptheslop,2007-06-28 16:05:00,112,"Amasing how guys come out with (what do you have to back up your position) but yet your opinon doesnt need any support at all, it doesnt take a rocket scientist to know that to much of one thing in any aspect of life has an adverse effect on its surroundings. SO lets see your data that shows carp have no effect on the lakes they are infesting. Thats right infesting, and next time your Dad tells you your opinion is the only one that counts, tell him I disagree. Sorry I dont share your passion for carp. And as far as tourism I havent seen that great numbers of folks are flocking to the Kawarthas to go carp fishing, compared to the numbers that fish for what are classed as sportfish in Ontario.  This is may OPINION and its not the same as yours but with the logic you respond with I guess that makes me wrong."
88847,Photoz,2007-06-28 16:42:00,792,"If perhaps you opened your eyes a bit, and listened a bit, you'd likely hear about THOUSANDS of Europeans, ESPECIALLY Brits, who pay thousands of dollars to come here and enjoy some of the best carp fishing in the world!! And if you're trying to book a carp fishing vacation from over there, you MIGHT be lucky enough if you act fast, to get a spot in 2008! There are with certainty, far greater numbers of carp anglers than trout, musky, salmon, pike or pickerel ALL put together that come to the Kawarthas and the St. Lawrence from overseas . . . .      if the carp were all killed off in this province, ESPECIALLY the Kawarthas and points east & south, it would cause an economic disaster for the tourist industry. Hell, I'd bet there are likely more people that target carp, using this board, than target muskies? But I'm sure an expert like yourself targets 'em all, that is, the ones the carp haven't scared away. If you can read, get yourself a few Brit magazines, check the carp fishing ads . . .    you know, the ones that DON'T bring anglers to Ontario . . . .    then grab a few LOCAL fishing mags . . . .   see what they have for ads, I think you might find carp fishing holidays outnumber ALL others by at least 5 to 1!! Then MAYBE you'll cut down your aimless, meaningless babbling when you see how stupid you've made yourself look!"
