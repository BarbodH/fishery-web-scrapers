88343,evster,2007-06-27 12:41:00,367,"Hello,  I am about to dive into the world of bait casters and am looking for some advice.  I am just wondering what length and action rod I should look for.  The rod will mainly be used for throwing spinnerbaits or heavy jigs.  I was thinking something about 7 feet, and probably medium heavy action.  But this is just a guess, any suggestions are appreciated.  Thanks! Evan"
88348,Mark Kulik,2007-06-27 12:53:00,348,"Hi Evan, try the St.Croix in the 7' Med, Heavy, casts a spinnerbait a long way and has great sensitivety.  Mark"
88362,OhioFisherman,2007-06-27 13:21:00,6623,"I like 6 1/2 or 7 foot rods medium or medium heavy action, I have no brand preference, it just has to feel good in my hand and have the right action. I don`t designate a rod as a spinnerbait rod or for this or that. Some are better suited for different lures or methods though."
88364,misfish,2007-06-27 13:24:00,29133,I like the 6 1/2 personally. Med/heavy aswell.
88365,Terry,2007-06-27 13:28:00,14456,I like a 6/6.5 med heavy for pitching jigs and for good accuracy around reeds and thick cover  but for smallmouth or open water I like 7ft fibreglass rod
88367,Steve,2007-06-27 13:32:00,2075,"I picked up this rod about four years ago....it has served me so well, i bought the exact model as a second two weeks ago.  6'10"", medium-heavy, extra fast, Shimano Compre. Costs about $100.  my father uses the st criox avid 7' medium heavy, and loves it as well...but it costs $250."
88369,shawnf,2007-06-27 13:38:00,46,"St. Croix makes a great rod, and Hagen's exclusively gets their blanks from them.  Here are a couple you might be interested in, but don't know if it's in the price range you're looking for.....  http://www.hagensrods.com/casting_rods_4.htm  I believe TJ has a Hagen's Rod, but can't remember which one. You'll have to ask him if he likes it."
