Take it easy everyone Mike"

88507,mgrieve,2007-06-27 18:26:00,20,"I am going up to a cottage for the week at Chandos. I really want to try laketrout fishing. Never have before. Couple questions: 1. Do I REALLY need a fish finder? 2. If not, how deep and where should I fish? 3. What kind of lure/bait should I use?  And do the Pike tend to be everywhere in the lake? We are at the Narrows on West Lake.  Any help??? Mike"

88520,Stoty,2007-06-27 18:54:00,2910,not to mention downriggers!
88521,misfish,2007-06-27 18:56:00,29133,"Good fish,n on that lake.I have fished it 3 times .Lakers can be had along the  deep rock edges on the islands,and there are monster pike there and big buckets."
88524,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-27 19:01:00,0, Are we talking casting or downrigging for lakers?I hear you can catch them relatively shallow in the spring but in the summer they go real deep.
88536,misfish,2007-06-27 19:22:00,29133, Casting.Early morning.
88582,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-27 21:37:00,0,Even in the summer??I'm thinking casting heavy spoons???
88585,misfish,2007-06-27 21:46:00,29133,"To each thier own.Jerk baits in minnow,black/silver."
88613,ribak,2007-06-27 22:38:00,19,"Hey guys just got back from the cottage, didnt do as much fishing as expected, because my buddy didnt get his boating licence, so we were limited to a canoe. It was in the west bay of the lake, and we fished in the area close to his cottage. I got one pike about 25' and lost another one, that must have been a bit bigger. Got a couple small largies, and several HUGE rock bass, all on husky jerks and spinnerbaits. It was a good getaway none the less."
