Like most on this board, I've been gearing up for the Bass Opener for weeks and made plans with my dad and a couple of friends to hit one of my favorite spots on Lake Simcoe (not the Cook's Bay area) this past Sunday. I saw the posts to avoid Simcoe this weekend as there was a tournament going on, but we've done really well there in the past and I figured there would be lots of fish for everyone.  We headed out a bit later than planned but still got onto the lake at 7:30. Unfortunately fishing was slow the entire day and we didn't pull up any of the Smallies that we were targetting. In fact, I didn't see anyone, including the guys involved in the tournament pickup anything in the spots we were fishing. Even though the day turned out to be a scorcher the water was pretty cold so I figure that the Smallies were laying low in the rocks to take in the heat, but we were never able to induce any bites.  We did pull up a number of nice perch though, in the 7 to 10 inch range, so the day wasn't totally bad.  On a side note, this is a great board!!"

88436,brownsound1113,2007-06-27 16:41:00,5,I had no doubt that guys in the tournament did well. Simcoe is a great lake for Bass. My crew and I just were able to reap the bounties on the day.
