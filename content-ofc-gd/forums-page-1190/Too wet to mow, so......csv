I gave in and grabbed my rod.  Was there for about 15 min, and wife says, ""Two more casts"".  Last cast, I land this nice fish:   Gotta have 1 more cast after that.  Dang!  Another one spit the hook.  ""1 more cast honey....promise"".  Here comes this one....bigger than the first!   One more cast....nothing.....bath time for the boys.....  dk"
