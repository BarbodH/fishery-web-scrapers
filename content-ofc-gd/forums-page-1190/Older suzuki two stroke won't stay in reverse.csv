The motor runs really good but the only thing is it wont stay in reverse.  I have to hold the gear changer in reverse to keep it from clicking back into neutral.  Is this something that is common?  Is there an easy fix?  I don't have the motor with me right now, but I can pass any info on to my dad to have him look at it.  Thanks! Evan"
88462,Uncle Buck,2007-06-27 17:28:00,1000,might be the detent spring in the lower unit...
88604,BITEME,2007-06-27 22:19:00,1969,Readjust the connector link on the back above the lower unit
88625,bigbuck,2007-06-27 22:55:00,2449,I'll second straightening out the connector link. You'll probably have to take it off to straighten it out a bit (don't do it too much or it won't engage reverse).
