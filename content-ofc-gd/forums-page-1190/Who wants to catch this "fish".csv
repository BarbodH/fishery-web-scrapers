88756,Stoty,2007-06-28 12:21:00,2910,"I am not talking about the lovely ladies on this site. I am saying that anything is possible with today's technology. And as a matter of fact, that dove commercial IS photoshop. But again, that has nothing to do with anyone on this site. My comment was about the technology."
