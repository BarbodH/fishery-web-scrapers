While I have fished G-Bay more then a few times (Sans Souci area ) I am new to this area.. are there are spots I should be looking at?  not looking for your hotspots here.. Just a general area to investigate and toss a few lures into..  My target Species will be Pickeral, Pike and I gotta try and get a Muskie for my team...  If you have fished this area and are willing to offer any advice I would certainly appreciate it.  TIA!  Gerritt."

Your options are very much restricted to the size of boat you have, as travelling across the open waters of Georgian Bay can be dangerous. In any case the first spot to try is around Phillip Edward Island. Specifically Collins Inlet and around the other side to Beaverstone Bay. Where the Mahzinazing River flows into the N/E corner of Beaverstone Bay is a good area. Fishing around any of the countless small islands in the areas I mentioned will net you lots of pike guaranteed. Probably the best fishing, but again you need a safe boat, is the delta of the Voyageur Channel. It's just east of Beaverstone Bay. It's basically a part of the Bad River, but is only accessable from Georgian Bay. Too many rapids upstream to navigate down from the top. The protected inshore waters there are teeming with fish. Tons of islands and structure...If you nose your way far enough up the channel/bay you'll eventually encounter current areas that are great for walleye. It's such a maze of islands in that area that it's very easy to get turned around and lost, so if possible I'd reccomend topo maps, compass and gps for safety. It's very remote and almost unfished, so if you're able to give it a shot it's well worth it. Good luck!  cheers,  Mike"
