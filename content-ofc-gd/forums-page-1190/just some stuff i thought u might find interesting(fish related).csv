88912,little angler,2007-06-28 19:03:00,128,"There are a few things to consider if your looking for a trophy  -weather -water temp -baitfish in the lake -fishing pressure -techniques/presentations  Thats is just to name a few, Here are th basics those:  Weather Season-summer if the weather has been steady, for a few days thats a good thing(water temp is steady) If the weather is overcast/raining then the fish will tend to be more aggressive and be roaming for food, as opposed to sticking to cover. This is where more aggressive techniques dominate (topwater,spinner baits, crankbaits,ect).If its a beautiful,hot sunny day, then the fish will be tight to cover, and you'll need to slow your presentation and really get in the thick of things meaning flipping docks,weeds,lilly pads,stumps,ect. Basically find the cover and fish SLOWLY    Baitfish You need to ""Math The Hatch"". If the primary food for bass in that lake is perch,then you want to throw baits that look like perch.If they feed on crayfish, then you want to throw bait that looks like crayfish.And so on....... If you catch a fish and it has something in its mouth,look at it.If you happen to keep fish to fry up,when your cleaning it, cut open the stomach and see whats inside. Always try to find out what the primary forage is,and use baits that match them!:]  Fishing pressure Generally,if the fishing pressure is heavy on the lake,you will want to downsize your baits. When fish see great big lures all the time buzzing by them,they get smart,and avoid them. You need to use""Finesse""them with smaller sized baits that they don't see everyday.  Techniques  The yall depend on conditions.  Sunny/hot-slow presentation-flipping around cover-jigs-tubes-worms ect-use natural colors  Overcast/ hot-fast presentation-spinner bait-crankbait-topwaters-use dark colors-black purple ect  Cold front-SLOW SLOW SLOW presentation-jigs-worms ect work VERY slowly around cover.  Good luck  ""Its all fun and games 'till someone looses a fish!"""
