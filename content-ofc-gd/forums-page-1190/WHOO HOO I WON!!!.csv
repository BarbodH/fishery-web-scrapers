Had to pick him up from the local mall and he asked to be picked up at the Eastside Marios' entrance where there was a patio that he could have a sasparilly. I was on my way to the mall anyhow so I offered the ride and when I arrived he had purchased a couple of budweisers for us which also came with a little coaster that was a small publicity contest bud had offered. It was an instant win or lose thing which you could also fill out for a draw. He won on the instant wins twice we had a total of 6 beer between us,we walked out with a free hat and a t-shirt which he didn't want and offered them to me. Thank you very much I said, then today I recieve a call from Eastside Marios and they tell me I have won a nascar jacket!!!!!Right ON I said!!!! here's a quick pic had to tell someone LOL! "
