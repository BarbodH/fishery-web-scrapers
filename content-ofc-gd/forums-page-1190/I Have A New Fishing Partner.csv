88220,bigbuck,2007-06-27 00:47:00,2449,"So, Saturday morning sitting in bed with my 3 favorite girls, my wife asks 'what do you want to do today honey??', my reply 'whatever Sophia wants to do (my oldest daughter at 2 1/2), Sophia, what do you want to do??' 'Go fishing daddy!!' Now, we were totally unprepared for this one and blown out of the water. I guess watching fishing shows on Saturday mornings all winter paid off. A call to my buddy up in Buckhorn and a couple of hours later after packing half the house (29 month old and a 15 month old), a trip to Canadian Tire to pick up a Dora the Explorer fishing rod and we were off to Upper Buckhorn. Later that day fishing off of the dock, Sophia caught a small perch, a rock bass and a nice sized bluegill, all in about 15 minutes, she even touched her worm and the fish that she caught. Hopefully, the bug has bitten and I'll have a fishing partner for life. All in all she caught 5 fish, not bad for a couple of hours of lounging on the dock. Daddy only managed a half dozen rock bass and a small smallie. We didn't get a chance to go for the muskie that has my name on him but that will be next time and another story. In our haste to get out of the house, we forgot our camera and my buddy's wife took a few shots that I'm waiting for."

I now know what it is a father feels when his child takes interest in the things we as adults like to do.... it is an amazing thing... keep up on it and encourage it!.. she is the future of fishing and will continue its long heritage!  Wicked!  Gerritt.

88296,motv8tr,2007-06-27 06:27:00,2587,"That's great bigbuck...nothing like getting the young one's hooked, before you know it you'll have three partners to fish with  Maureen"
88352,ccmtcanada,2007-06-27 12:59:00,7971,"That's a GREAT story!  When my little one took an interest, it was the same thing....get to Canadian Tire to get her a Barbie combo...LOL.  There's nothing like seeing a little one smile and get all excited about fishing.  Right now, when I take her, I usually dont even get to put a line in myself, but it doesn't matter to me....just watching kids fish is all the entertainment and work I can handle...LOL"
88407,TJQ,2007-06-27 15:06:00,7806,Ya.. Two things I learned... not too hard... and make sure they catch fish... any kind of fish...  if you can get out in the evening for catfish somewhere.. they are a hoot...  fight like troopers and not hard to catch!!  Oh ya.. and when I have the kids in the boat... no fishing for DAD!!  Its a great time to give them your FULL attention.
88410,bigbuck,2007-06-27 15:13:00,2449,"Yeah, I kinda figured that I'll have to take her to places that she can slay the panfish and NOT push too hard. The next thing I want to put in her hand is a golf club but that can wait a while. It's a good thing my wife loves to fish (she's the LOTW jigging for walleye specialist) and my baby girl has to wait till next year. Thanks for the good wishes.  B"
