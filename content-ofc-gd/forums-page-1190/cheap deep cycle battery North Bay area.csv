88603,bow slayer,2007-06-27 22:18:00,1074,I want to pick up a deep cycle battery when i get up to North Bay tomorrow. nothing fancy just a deep cycle cheapie. Just need it for the trolling motor only which only gets used seldom. Anyone suggest a place to check thanks
88653,Corey,2007-06-27 23:29:00,355,I would check out Giesler Marine a half hour south in Powassan!
88658,fishindevil,2007-06-28 00:00:00,6254,"Well canadian tire sells about 10 different styles of deep-cycle marine & r.v.  batteries,from about $50-$150 thats where i got mine for my lund ,they have a great warranty as well,bring your old one and you get a discount too....good-luck    oh ya wal-mart has them too....cheers"
88715,Mike the Pike,2007-06-28 03:34:00,3421,Costco .I think only sudbury has a Costco not Northbay.I have had 2 Kirkland batteries great bang for the buck.  MTP
88817,Abberz,2007-06-28 15:48:00,140,If you can find a Costco the Kirkland (Costco's own brand) are pretty good and cheap. I picked up the biggest deep cycle they have for 59.99 on sale two years ago......no complaints yet.
88898,lunkerbasshunter,2007-06-28 18:30:00,2585,no costco in north bay but you can hit the one in barrie on your way up.  i think its just off the 400.  walmart and canadian tire both in north bay will have marine batteries too.  cheers!
