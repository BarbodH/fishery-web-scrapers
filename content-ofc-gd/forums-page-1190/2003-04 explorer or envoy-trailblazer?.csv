88291,bow slayer,2007-06-27 05:07:00,1074,Lookin to purchase one of these 2 in the fall. Just like to hear the good and bad about both vehicles. I did own a 1992 explorer for 8 years loved and hated it. right now I have a montana SV6 what a piece of s**t. thanks
88314,snackpack5150,2007-06-27 10:45:00,79,"Well not being a lover of Ford products I would say stay away,Envoys and Trailblazers are great.. lot of room for stuff and they seem powerful enough for towing even with the v-6.  Good luck on your choice  Ken"
88320,1leggedangler,2007-06-27 11:07:00,364,"Enjoyed my extended trailblazer for 4 years. No problems at all beside the one call back for the back lights. Good luck with your choice.  Cheers, 1leg"
88328,Guidofisherman,2007-06-27 12:04:00,206,"I have an 02 Explorer and have had several issues with the driveshaft and noisy rear end gears. The 02's to '04's have the same aluminum drive shafts. At highway speed, feel if there is any vibration in the driver's seat. My gear noise was also at highway speed of around 100km. The rest of the vehicle I like. Alan"
88368,muskymatt,2007-06-27 13:35:00,2608,"I had an 03 trailblazer and loved it. Now I have an 05 trailblazer with the extra row of seats ( seating for 8) and love it , tows my 20' boat no problems and lots of cargo room.  Not the best on gas when loaded and pulling the boat but lots of power and trailers well."
88390,BryonG,2007-06-27 14:30:00,52,"I had 7 explorers befor switching over to the Envoy. The Envoy is way nicer,better riding more power,etc.,etc..Pulled my 17 foot boat to Canada and back with power to spare.I got 15.5 mpg this spring fully loaded towing the boat."
88400,bigbuck,2007-06-27 14:57:00,2449,"I'd go with the GM over the FORD. I like the Envoys and almost bought one last year but picked up a minivan instead cuz it made more sense. The Explorer really looked pretty much the same for 10+ years and I heard the 6 cylinder engine had problems with the timing chain breaking, needing a complete engine rebuild (happened twice to a friends '98, once under warranty, once not, with 180k on it)."
88425,kemper,2007-06-27 15:57:00,2232,"Simply from experience of my parents cars (many as we tend to flip them every 2 or 3 years) the ford is a MUCH better option. We had 4 fords in a row and never had any major repair problems, we now have 2 GMs in the driveway and every month one of them is in the shop for some piece of crap part that just decided to stop working. And geuss what, one of them is a cadillac.  I for one, will never purchase a GM untill they revise the plan and stop making cars the blow up 3 minutes after the warrantee is up!"
88464,Uncle Buck,2007-06-27 17:31:00,1000,"i had a new trailblazer as a rental when mine was getting fixed and it was a real hog on Gas, not that i pay too much attention but this thing was way worse then my 2000 envoy 4.3 V6, I could literally see the gas gauge move..."
88471,JPD,2007-06-27 17:34:00,296,I've been using GMC/Chev for the last 8 years and haven't looked back. I have a buddy with a Trailblazer that tows a 20 foot bass boat and loves it. They may use a bit more gas but don't sound like they are going to fall apart like every Ford I have been in or driven.  JP
88479,misfish,2007-06-27 17:39:00,29133,"  Hey hey hey,no need for low blows here pal.LOL"
88512,mart,2007-06-27 18:37:00,93,I tow with an 03 Trailblazer and the power is far better than the Explorer.I use to tow with a 96 Exployer and wasn't happy with the tow power of the Ford. The Chev has lots of power to spare and tows nicer too.. The Trailblazer is hard on gas though.I agree with JPD about the Chev  pulling a 20 footer with no problem.I tow my 17.5 footer and can hardly notice it's there.
88516,Billy Bob,2007-06-27 18:49:00,5865,Here is a choice to THINK about.  http://www.toyota.com/tundra/index.html?s_...TN_TUNDRA_INDEX  This might even cost you less and have a MUCH better resale. They are selling like hot cakes here in the USA. You should be able to get one in Canada.  I am waiting for mine to arrive tomorrow. You can get it in the NEW 5.7 L engine with a six speed tranny or the 4.7 L engine with a five speed tranny. It will haul and out tow ANY 1/2 ton truck out there and with either the double cab or crew cab you have PLENTY of room for the rest of the tribe. At least take one for a ride.  Bob
88518,misfish,2007-06-27 18:52:00,29133," Oh yeah,and I pull my 17.9 with a 97 F150.   So there LOL"
88595,mart,2007-06-27 22:05:00,93,No hard feelings Misfish on the Ford bashing. I still own one as well. It's just not good enough to tow with.LOL... Maybe we can have a drag with our boats in tow at Sparrow!!!
88596,bow slayer,2007-06-27 22:06:00,1074,thanks for the replies. If it were up to me I would go for the Nissan Pathfinder. I test drove a 2003 last week and it was great. Rode   and handled much nicer than the explorer or trailblazer/envoy.The problem is it only seats 5 were the other 2 can seat seven which comes into play when the kids hgockey season starts up. I will be pulling a 12ft tent trailer and 16 ft starcraft.So far sounds like the GM owners are satisfied.
