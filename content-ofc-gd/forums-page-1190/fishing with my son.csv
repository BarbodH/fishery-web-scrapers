Instead I took my son down one of the bush roads and walked into a set of rapids to try and get a few walleye for supper. We got in and set up on a large flat rock and I casted my sons lure (Calcutta swim shad) into the slack water to show him where to cast and then I started to tie a lure onto my line. No sooner than I picked out a lure and I hear "" got one Dad"" He reels in a nice 15"" walleye and I help him take it off and put it in the pail. He casts out into the slack and I again pick up my rod to tie on. """"Got one Dad"" Okay I'm thinking this is gonna be a short day. Help him take this one off which is about the same size and put in in the pail. My son says to me "" I think they really like that white stuff in the water( the foam from the rapids) watch"" He casts into it and this time I don't even bother grabbing my rod. About four cranks on the reel and ""Got one Dad"" Three casts and three nice walleye We fished for about ten more minutes before the rain came but he did manage a fourth and all I could muster up was a nice smallie."

The thing that made me laugh the most was on the ride out of the bush he looked over at me(he is seven years old) and said ""boy Dad isn't that weird I caught four fish and you only got one"" Not being sarcastic just simply stating a fact. I just about busted a gut when he said it."
