895095,Big Cliff,2015-01-30 18:33:00,6899,Could it have something to do with tracking cookies?
895228,aplumma,2015-01-31 14:05:00,6896,yes if you clear cookies or use a program like C cleaner resigning in is needed.  Art
895232,captpierre,2015-01-31 15:04:00,2521,Not sure what you mean by cookies. My iPhone kept me signed in until I got a new IOS upgrade. Seems since then I have to sign in fresh every time. Can you tell me how to fix it please
895247,Big Cliff,2015-01-31 16:30:00,6899,I'm not the best guy to ask but I would think you will have to go into your settings and allow cookies but you might want to check with Apple about that first.
895255,Gerritt,2015-01-31 17:22:00,6129,Are you using Safari?
895257,Gerritt,2015-01-31 17:26:00,6129,"My bet is you are using Safari which is preloaded on iPhones etc....  Go to settings, Safari , block cookies , select Allow from websites I visit.  This should fix you up.  G"
895310,captpierre,2015-01-31 23:27:00,2521,Thanks Gerrit. I use Safari but the settings are already as you say. What gives? Use Chrome? Peter.
895312,Terry,2015-01-31 23:31:00,14456,turn off do not track too and see if that works
