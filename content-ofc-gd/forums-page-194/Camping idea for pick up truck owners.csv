895273,John Bacon,2015-01-31 19:34:00,3277,I saw this on another site.  http://boredomtherapy.com/diy-adventure-truck/?as=6022520062284
895276,misfish,2015-01-31 20:30:00,29133,I now have a spring project.  Thats wicked cool.
895284,big guy,2015-01-31 21:40:00,414,"My buddy did that with his truck back in '95 when we went to Wakami Lake for a 5 day trip. Bed across the top of the wheel wells, slide outs underneath big enough to hold rubbermaids for clothing and food, fan in the top of the cap for air flow. Worked like a charm. He slept well, I didn't listening to his drunk @ss snore half the night. Great trip though."
895285,aplumma,2015-01-31 21:51:00,6896,we actually do this in a lot of the vans when we carry pipe.  Art
895294,dwc67,2015-01-31 22:18:00,140,we actually do this in a lot of the vans when we carry pipe.  Art looks like a good idea for laying it as well
895301,misfish,2015-01-31 22:48:00,29133,"looks like a good idea for laying it as well  When I got to this,you beat me to it.LOL"
895304,Joeytier,2015-01-31 22:57:00,3990,"Very skilled build!!  But not exactly practical for someone that needs to haul stuff in their box.  His compartments wouldn't be great for a chainsaws/coolers/rods and reels etc.  I'm gonna get a truck box tent for next season, can't wait to get using that."
895317,chris.brock,2015-01-31 23:47:00,4053,"It's pretty hard to haul a snowmobile, a load of firewood or a yard of soil with that set-up. I'll stick to rubbermaids for my storage bins and sleep in a tent.  Interesting post though."
895331,misfish,2015-02-01 00:30:00,29133," Not when your a walker Chris. Aint that what trailers are for anyways? LOL   My truck is for fishing and hunting. No wood to haul,no one to move, as I already told them all,it,s not a moving truck.LOL  Just need to look for a new cap for the truck."
895359,chris.brock,2015-02-01 02:16:00,4053,"Different strokes for different folks I guess. He camps, you fish and hunt, I do all of the above and everything else."
895361,grizzlybri,2015-02-01 02:20:00,565,"that is way better then what i made for the back of my truck, I'll post a picture up tomorrow of what i made for mine."
895364,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-01 02:34:00,8243,"Sorry guys, nice build but I have too many projects here to spend money and time on a tool pull out. They sell them you know. I have a "" Bed in a Bag"" that I paid about 50 bucks for a Queen size bed including pillows in case I ever had he insane thought of going camping, actually I have no idea why I bought it besides I thought it was neat. To me camping is staying at a Holiday Inn Express. But it sure looks like some very well done work. Just a waste of time and $$$$. My Grand Father came to this country so they didn't have to sleep on the ground and burn wood to cook a meal. I have to admit I went camping once when I was 18. Left in the middle of the night and checked into a motel. 110% true story.  How can someone pull into a campsite driving a Benz? Yes I'm a citiot even though we live in the country. The Benz got traded in for a Silverado. I'm trying."
895367,grizzlybri,2015-02-01 02:46:00,565,"I didn't pay anything for what i built, in fact i got paid to make it (made it at work during some rare down time)"
895380,wormdunker,2015-02-01 07:36:00,1711,Good idea & great craftsmanship.  Awesome for camping where I spend most of my fishing trips. The nearest motel is 50 km away.  Holiday Inn is not an option.
895387,dave524,2015-02-01 11:38:00,4508,"Never had one , but slide in pickup campers were big, back in the 70's/early80's. Large units that had fridge, stove,air, some had a bunk over the cab and overshot the back of the bed by a foot or so, Kitchen table that made into a bunk and a sink of course. When not in use you could drop the legs/stands and jack it up and drive the truck out from under it , leaving it sitting on stands in the driveway. I can't remember the last one I've seen like that, thing of the past. Buddy had one and we used it to go chuck shooting and spec fishing up on the Rocky Saugeen in the summer, way back when.  edit: Guess they still make them  https://www.google.ca/search?q=pick+up+truck+camper+unit&rlz=1T4GZGN_enCA451CA451&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=TRDOVIXkKtGdygTe74GoCw&ved=0CDYQsAQ&biw=1486&bih=698"
895388,lew,2015-02-01 11:43:00,12766,"No wood to haul,no one to move, as I already told them all,it,s not a moving truck.LOL  Saw a truck awhile back Brian with a bumper sticker that read ....  ""Yes it's my truck and no you can't borrow it""  Thought that was pretty good"
895389,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-01 11:57:00,8243,"dave524, they still make those truck campers. A friend in Waterford still has his 80's era and another camping nutbar pal just got one for his late model Toyota .  I think the motel I went to was a 50K drive from the campsite on Mt. Washington. I needed a TV anyway the Olympics were on."
895411,John Bacon,2015-02-01 14:56:00,3277,Maybe I'll get this one if my next vehicle is a truck.  http://www.google.ca/imgres?imgurl=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cRDaZRfhwqI/UbGr01yTCuI/AAAAAAAADVg/WMgDo21rr1w/s1600/P4010017.jpg&imgrefurl=http://handmadematt.blogspot.com/2013/06/demountable-camper-van-4-x-4-pick-up.html&h=480&w=640&tbnid=0Ib_gC_72XjYhM:&zoom=1&docid=Y9t9snx-QS8iOM&ei=1D3OVNj9I5bIsAThr4HoBw&tbm=isch&ved=0CCoQMygNMA0
895421,Mister G,2015-02-01 15:55:00,1429,"Too old to be sleeping in the back of a truck now a days. Cabin, cottage or hotel (camp Sheraton) fits me much better now.  However, for almost 20 years I had a van(s) that I slept in at boat launches all over North America for FREE ! ! !  We would take out anything we didn't need in the van and put it in the boat and cover the boat overnight. Then reverse the procedure to go fishing. To sleep in the van I got some REAL NICE caboose cushions that fit perfectly on the van floor. Still have those cushions in the attic of the garage. VERY comfortable to sleep on.  For camping I would take a van any day over a pick up truck for sleeping quarters."
895425,Fisherman,2015-02-01 16:57:00,7201,"It's probably not for everyone but I'm sure it serves its purpose.  I had a slide in about 20 years ago, a little cramped for 2 adults and 2 kids.  I still kick my butt for selling it, it would have been great for going to different lakes or a hunting getaway."
