892772,Skud,2015-01-18 23:47:00,739,Nice haul for the day. I am surprised the whities catch the gobies so easily since they appear to be fast little buggers.
892773,Cosmos,2015-01-18 23:49:00,588,Thank you for your advice icefisherman. Helped me to put 3 whitie and 3 lakers on the ice today.
892774,Beavertail,2015-01-18 23:50:00,331,"Thanks for the report and pics, looks like another great day. The last pic is crazy, what a gluttonous pig! Gobies eh...no wonder the meegs work so well."
892778,icefisherman,2015-01-18 23:58:00,952,"Thank you for your advice icefisherman. Helped me to put 3 whitie and 3 lakers on the ice today.  Costa my pleasure my friend. Glad you did well. Once you figure the action on the Meegs it is the most productive lure....and you never snag a fish with a Meeg. Beer is on you next time we run into each other ha ha  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
892804,Sharkbait22,2015-01-19 02:35:00,297,Gobies!  Wow that's a lot.  How deep were you fishing icefisherman?

892828,Joey,2015-01-19 05:53:00,9122,"Oh what a surprise, Emil caught whitefish on the ice  Good for you bud, can't believe how many gobies in that fishes' stomach, wow!!!!  Well done bud!"

Sleepjigging It is a flip over one man hut....rather small. I never fish in a hut but friend gave it to me and mostly took it out for my son as it was raining for few hours in the morning.  Oh what a surprise, Emil caught whitefish on the ice  Good for you bud, can't believe how many gobies in that fishes' stomach, wow!!!!  Well done bud!  Thanks Joey.Haven't seen each other for a while. Hope to see you this season.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

892887,Locnar,2015-01-19 18:51:00,645,Beers on me if you teach me the way. Looks like a brilliant day of fishin
892893,icefisherman,2015-01-19 19:25:00,952," How do you work those jigs?   Beers on me if you teach me the way. Looks like a brilliant day of fishin  Cut the head of the tube so you can slide it on top of the Meegs from starting at the tip of the hook and push it onto the Meegs. Turn it around to align the black back of the tube with the black back of the Meeg. Once tube is on the Meeg the friction will keep it there so no need to glue anything. Sometime I cut a bit from the tail of the Meegs as Whities like to grab on them if too long. Jigging it is not that difficult but it take some time to master....jig right over the bottom....3-4 times...then lift 2-3 feet up and crush it back to the bottom....wait 2 sec and jig again 3-4 times slow motion short strikes right above bottom....then repeat....some days they want more delicate jig some days with more movement...you adjust accordingly...once you figure it out the best way to catch whities and lakers...love it.... It is all pretty simple....the jigging action is the most critical part. Good luck.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
