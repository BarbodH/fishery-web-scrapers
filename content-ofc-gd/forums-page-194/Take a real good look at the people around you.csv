And we have been though lots of good times also, and when a guy is strong and on top of things, he can help the guy who is struggling.  That was why we started calling our fishing and hunting trips, and this probably 20 years ago, ""Male Healing Retreats.""  And every one of us has had his healing moments and times of need, but we help each other out.  I think that many of us who enjoy time in the outdoors can share that passion on a very fundamental level, which helps our buddies to deal with their challenges.  Doug"

I've spent not a day, a week nor a year... but well over 4 years sitting in hospitals watching the life get sucked out of a kid, her two siblings and my wife ....while finding little opportunity to work and make money to pay the bills on my end as that's what ""dad"" is supposed to do. Apparently there's a few I've alienated in some way or form, that went from friends to enemies in a short 4 years, and frankly I don't really care. If they can't deal with the realities of what I'm going though, then they weren't friends in the first place.  There isn't a single person on this board who can even come close to understanding what you've been through. As far you alienating people I honestly doubt it. Sometimes life has a way of separating people - things happen.    As far as Bruce's post goes I think everyone can relate to what he said. It's a part of being human."

I have met thousands of people throughout my life and have seen some very unhappy people that had it all, or should I say a lot of stuff to try and make them happy. The trophy 2nd wife, the big house not home, the cars, the boats, the beach house, the Miami condo, the perfect family. Too many I have known that had appeared to be happy and have taken their own lives, too many.  Depression is something that no matter how one tries to will themselves to be happy it just aint happening. With counseling and medication it can get one to a better place but it's not as simple as willing one to happiness, that can not be done. I can admit I had suffered from depression before that word was even known to the public. If anyone does suffer from this you must seek help now. It's nothing to be ashamed of.

895390,Big Cliff,2015-02-01 12:08:00,6899,"What is most important in life, having many friends or just trying to be a good friend and reaching out to others?  Over the years I have tried and still do try to be there for those that I can help when I can. Obviously I can't be all things to all people all the time and I am sure that over the years I have probably let lots of people down.  It wasn't because I didn't care, sometimes I just didn't know what to do or say that would help, sometimes I had my own issues to deal with and sometimes I was just too busy trying to be a friend to someone else that I felt needed it.  The one thing I have learned though is to try to try to cut people some slack and not be too judgemental. If someone is having a hard time for whatever reason and acts out of charactor (been there, done that) instead of jumping on them, reach out, find out what is behind it and try to understand their point of view. Doesn't mean you have to agree with it, doesn't mean they are right, just try to understand it.  Friendship is a pretty complicated thing, we expect a friend to forgive us when we mess up, to be there for us when we need them and we expect a friend to understand!  It's a wonderful thing but it has to work both ways!"
895393,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-01 12:41:00,8243,"Crappyperchhunter, agree to disagree. But you are right, there are a few people out there that choose to be just downright miserable and mean and act unhappy and they like it. I actually have a friend that comes across like that but it's his defense mechanism to keep people from getting too close to him so he can't be hurt again, some of the most insensitive to others are the most sensitive when it comes to them, sad really. I have another ""associate"" that is just downright a miserable bas&a*d to everyone. He is the don't tell me what you did for me yesterday tell me what you can do for me today kind of non friend. He thinks he has friends and what he has is many people that are afraid he is going to go off on them. He's a bully.

I've spent not a day, a week nor a year... but well over 4 years sitting in hospitals watching the life get sucked out of a kid, her two siblings and my wife ....while finding little opportunity to work and make money to pay the bills on my end as that's what ""dad"" is supposed to do. Apparently there's a few I've alienated in some way or form, that went from friends to enemies in a short 4 years, and frankly I don't really care. If they can't deal with the realities of what I'm going though, then they weren't friends in the first place. I have the ones that have stuck by me, have gone out of their way to pick me up from hospitals to hit the BOQ together, they understand why their fishing trip North got cancelled not once but three times, or is currently on hold until a days notice.... and I will enjoy the many laughs we have as we hit the ice or waters together in the coming months and years as I know they'll still be on ""speed dial""!  And it's good to see that Matt found that revelation that I told him he would. Not sure if it's an age thing, or where it comes in... but I think I've noted it before. I've gone from someone that couldn't sit in a chair for 10 minutes without getting up and looking out front and back door of the house, to someone that can sit in a waiting room, hospital room or a cabin corner for hours on end and I don't even need a fishing magazine to keep my brain engaged while there!"
895135,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-30 22:14:00,8243,"This hits close to home as I had to bury 2 good friends within a week this month. And a 3rd is in a hospice with stage 4 brain cancer waiting for his life to end. It seems the death of someone close and someone not close sometimes changes our look on life, some for the good some for the bad. The entire town of Caledonia and area mourns as we prepare to say good bye to 2 good young men that met in a head on collision and both lost their lives on a wet and cold windy morning this week. Death is tragic no matter. A 18 year old son and just a child was amongst the two and a 52 year old Dad was the second who also lost his life a few days ago. The first emotion for my wife and myself for our friends and then within a few days our neighbors was grief. Our second emotion is anger and bewilderment.  For some mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, wives and husbands brothers and sisters in war torn lands the grief is followed by bewilderment that turns to anger and rage. That rage often turns to vengeance and the cycle starts for another family and friends who mourn the loss of their loved ones. And the cycle of violence once again begins.  There is no simplified solution here, it is life but just being kind to one another here may be a start."
895168,bigugli,2015-01-31 01:40:00,6138,"Wayne, I understand only too well about that sense of alienation. Been dealing with it since 08 with the wife's and daughter's numerous ailments and hospitalizations. Had a lot of people drift away since then. Some are pissed off too.  Heck, the son couldn't, and still can't, deal with his mother's cancer.. Unfortunate, yes. My problem, no.  I will not let them get under my skin. Sorry if I can't make long term plans or only go fishing as a last minute plan. The care and well being of my family, and my puppy, always comes first.  Those who don't get it never will. You've got your head screwed on straight, and your priorities right. That is all that matters.  Sadly, there are always far too many fair weather friends. That's why I think of them as acquaintances.  The friends I have I know will give the shirt off their backs, just as I would for them. Sounds like you have similar solid friends."
