Also why they triage people in ER, worse case scenario, you keep getting bumped as the more serious start rolling in.

894698,G.mech,2015-01-28 17:16:00,830,"We are in a 'underserviced' area which means that if you don't have a doctor, you go on a waiting list to get one and you take whoever they give you within your LHIN.  If you are lucky enough to have a family doctor, you cannot change doctors.  We used to be able to go to a walk-in clinic if necessary which eased the stress on the ER's but a few years ago that changed and now you cannot go to a clinic unless your family doctor is a 'member' of that clinic.  I really don't understand the logic of this but the government says it was to ensure 'continuity of service' (i.e. you see the same doctor as much as possible).  So, I was sick last January and I called the family doc who said he could see me in May.  I told him that I was sick now and couldn't wait for four months and he told me my only option was to go to emergency.  I went to the ER, saw a doc who sent me for an ultrasound which they in turn sent to my family doctor for him to follow up on and treat the blood clot in my leg....I'm still waiting without even a phone call returned (good thing thrombosis isn't serious).  It eventually went away on its own thankfully.  I actually haven't seen my doctor since 2006 and doubt I ever will again since the only time you can is if you're healthy enough to wait for his schedule to open up.  My 'continuity of service' is kind of messed up under this new plan.  This system is supposed to be the best in the world but it sure ain't working for me... I guess the point of my long winded post is that people like Cliff or others who are in need of care shouldn't feel guilty or awkward going to get looked at.  The emergency rooms are stuffed with people, some who really need help, some who should be getting help elsewhere, and some who just want a hug and kleenex while others don't go because of the long waits or the fear that they're being a burden.  How many people die at home of heart attacks for just this reason?  Our system is broken and all the money that is being spent doesn't seem to get to where it needs to be."

Well at the time I was studying to be a nutritional consultant practitioner and knew something was very wrong( black and blue from hip to foot and foot literally fused to my a** lol)  I wasnt 100% sure what was wrong but I knew it was either my hamstring or I had badly torn a muscle, and would require surgery.  My doc said no, so I fired him. It took one month to get another doctor and by then my leg has fused, maybe 10% mobility.  As soon as I seen my new doc he said oh my you need surgery asap!

I had a huge gash on the side of my head and they took me to the hospital. I still have a patch on my head where it hit the ice (there was a skating rink at the bottom of the hill) that hair has never grown there again.

I don't like going to the Dr. very much and really resist going to the hospital emergency for anything that isn't an immediate threat to life but since all of you seemed to think it was the smart thing to do, I took your advice.  Went to the hospital here yesterday to get checked out, got there at 9:30, got out at 5:30, made for a long day of just sitting but at least we know. They decided to do a CT Scan just to be sure and their conclusion is that there is/was a concussion and whiplash but no brain bleeding so all is good.  They gave me some stuff for the pain and an anti inflamitory, told me to be VERY careful to not do it again (like I want to LOL).  I did ask if I would be able to dance and the Dr. said ""sure"", that's great because I never could before.  Love, Light, and Happiness to all and thanks for caring!"

At one point I almost got up and walked out, not because I was upset about the wait, I just felt that someone else needed the attention more than I did. Then I realized that they had priortized things and I was quite content to wait until they could deal with me.

Conditions were excellent for getting around on the ATV, almost no snow so we hooked up the sled and away we went. The electric drill worked beautifully and we punched a bunch of holes and set up. It wasn't long before we started picking up some keeper perch and we were having a lot of laughs then it happened!  I guess I was going to get another minnow and the next thing I knew I was leaning against my ATV and had no idea where I was or what had happened. Apparently my feet just went out from under me on the ice and I went down hard smacking the back of my head on the ice.  Jim said I was out cold for about a minute and when I came too I started crawling back toward my bike, by then he had reached me and helped me back onto my feet but I had no idea where I was and didn't recognize the shore line (even though I've been there many times over the last few years).  I had no idea which way home was, but Jim loaded up the sled and got me back onto the bike, by then I had sort of started to regain my senses to some degree and while I was still dazed at least knew which way to head for home but I was still pretty confused and some what disoriented.  We got back to the house and had a cup of tea but it took me about an hour just to be able to sort of understand what had happened and I still have no memory of a period of time before, during, or after falling. It really made me think though about the number of us the go off sometimes miles onto the ice with no one else around and how quickly we can get into trouble.  It worked out ok in my case apart from being sore and I think having a mild concusion; even if I had been alone I guess I'd have survived but it sure could have worked out a whole lot differently.  Be careful out there, life doesn't come with a reset button.  "
893812,lew,2015-01-24 10:43:00,12766,That's nasty stuff Cliff but with being unconsious for a full minute I'd think a checkup by a doctor would be in order. Not a good thing when you rattle your brain like that.
893813,porkpie,2015-01-24 10:44:00,2521,Glad your okay!  Bad piece of luck.
893815,Sandbag,2015-01-24 12:06:00,533,"Cliff  As Lew said, i think a quick trip to the doctor to be on the safe side would be a good idea.  That $100 bucks you owe me can wait til tomorrow.  hahaha  All joking aside, it sounds like you really rattled your head and should have it looked at.  Hope your feeling better  Cheers  Craig"
893817,moxie,2015-01-24 12:40:00,1566,It is a crap shoot. Good to hear you're ok.  X3 on the trip to the Doc just to check the wiring.
893818,NAW,2015-01-24 12:41:00,4022,"That must have been/is a horrible feeling.  Hopefully you bounce back quick!  I almost bailed a few times the other day, even with my ice cleats on."
893819,manjo39,2015-01-24 12:41:00,354,Glad you're okay.
893824,Steelheadphycho,2015-01-24 13:10:00,470,"HOLY COW! Your absolutely right. It can happen any time, any where. Having someone with you is better than not.  Glad your ok!"
893825,Meegs,2015-01-24 13:19:00,249,Seen some nasty falls out  there.  U got a tough time getting me out there now without a set of cleats on.  Glad your ok and nothing more than a headache.  Can be some scary stuff.
893827,Joeytier,2015-01-24 13:29:00,3990,"Glare ice is a dangerous thing, and so are concussions.  The fact that you were out cold for any amount of time tells me that you could have more than just a mild concussion.  I would definitely visit your doctor as soon as possible."
893840,John Bacon,2015-01-24 14:19:00,3277,"Yesterday was one of those winter days that I look forward to, I didn't have to work, the sun was shining, and it wasn't too cold.  A friend had asked me if I'd like to get out ice fishing, no big fancy trip or anything, just the two of us heading out here to see if we could find some crappie and/or perch, relax and enjoy the day.  Conditions were excellent for getting around on the ATV, almost no snow so we hooked up the sled and away we went. The electric drill worked beautifully and we punched a bunch of holes and set up.

Be careful out there, life doesn't come with a reset button.    I glad you are okay.  I would also urge you to see a doctor.  If anyone is in this situation, I would recommend heading straight for emergency.  Your brain can continue to sustain damage after a head injury; there are medications to reduce the damage that occurs after a head injury."
893846,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-24 14:53:00,8243,"Cliff get to a hospital forthwith. Loss of consciousness is a serious condition. I've rung my bell playing ball and at the plant many times but never ""knocked out"" and am dealing with short term memory loss now. No such thing as a mild concussion. In Ontario if a worker looses consciousness the MOL must be called at it is deemed to be a critical injury."
893856,Burtess,2015-01-24 15:24:00,901,"Another to urge you to go to the emergency....  lots of stuff can be delayed with a head injury, even a minor one.  You might wait for a few hours but it is much better than the other options!  Hope you are OK and feel better!!  Burt"
893860,davew3,2015-01-24 15:27:00,430,Cliff   don't know how you will take this.  You would be an idiot not to get your self checked out.  Last year I lost a friend of 20 yrs due to a slow brain bleed from a fall.  We being older now don't deal with things as well as when we were younger.  Regards
893861,kickingfrog,2015-01-24 15:34:00,8333,Glad you are feeling better now.  The old joke is: Hockey player gets knocked out and does not remember who he is. Coach tells the player he's Wayne Gretzky.  Jim should have told you that you were Gord Pyzer.
893863,woodenboater,2015-01-24 15:36:00,2277,"please go to the hospital ASAP and get checked out. You had a concussion and NEED to have it looked at. Problems can develop later. Please.  and while it may not be necessary, ask about getting a baseline reading. Might have to go to a specialist but this could be very important down the road."
893870,Beans,2015-01-24 16:03:00,3339,Hey Cliff...Get that checked out...We needs you !!!
893871,Fisherman,2015-01-24 16:16:00,7201,"Go to the doc, it doesn't cost anything except some of your time.  Next stop, get a set of ice chains for your boots, it's safety insurance."
893888,bigbuck,2015-01-24 17:56:00,2449,"Cliff, do not screw around, head straight to Emerg and get checked out. Yu were out for a minute and were very disoriented afterwards. Head injuries arre not to be trifled with. My wife is still dealing with the effects of a concussion from 2 months ago and it is taking it's time to get better."
893889,limeyangler,2015-01-24 18:05:00,5204,"Glad you are OK, go see the Doc."
893890,c10,2015-01-24 18:15:00,131,"Glad to hear you are okay! I'll say the same thing as everyone else said, go get it checked out! You never know what concussions can turn into! Let us know the results as well! But you're right, seems everything on the water happens in a slpit second, doesn't seem to matter whether you're walking on it or in a boat or on shore lol"
893902,misfish,2015-01-24 18:49:00,29133,"If you dont go to the doc Cliff,Im going to knock you out,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, LOL  Glad your ok (so you think/say),but please go get checked out bud."
893910,Moosebunk,2015-01-24 19:08:00,3970,"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/orthostatic-hypotension/basics/definition/con-20031255   If you like, scroll through from definition to causes and such.  I like this website in practice.  Although, not saying that's what happened to you, it just first came to mind.  The mild concussion afterwards is possibly the result of your longer effects lasting throughout the rest of your day.  Food for thought..?  Glad you're OK.  Scary stuff when you're way out there Cliff.  And heck, we all know how hard the ice is when you fall on it and injure anything."
893919,ketchenany,2015-01-24 19:21:00,3229,Get it checked out ASAP.  Things change in seconds. Glad  you had help out there and made it back.
