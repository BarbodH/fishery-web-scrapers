895219,davey buoy,2015-01-31 12:56:00,5505,Another very lucky one.!!!!
895221,wormdunker,2015-01-31 13:05:00,1711,Very fortunate to have been rescued!  Thanx to Mr. Green
895248,Big Cliff,2015-01-31 16:42:00,6899,"Well, first of all thank you Mr. Green because some ones father/brother/son will be coming home tonight because of you!  Second, I'd like to know more about this; was he near a river or something? There is at least 14"" of ice out here on Sturgeon Lake (I AM NOT SAYING IT IS SAFE) anywhere I have drilled holes in the past few weeks. I would assume that the ice thickness is the same there."

But on a side note, did you guys read some of the comments people were posting? some pretty obnoxious people lol, some nice ones as well though don't get me wrong"
895261,mistaredone,2015-01-31 17:44:00,913,300lb man is probably riding a large ATV. That could be an easy 1000lbs. Glad everyone was ok
895282,ketchenany,2015-01-31 21:20:00,3229,"I had experience on Simcoe where the ice 1+ km out was well over 12 inches and where we parked less than six with a small creek that flowed in, we kept clear. Was it a pressure crack? He must have been close to shore by the sounds of it! glad he made it out safe. At night it may have turned out different."
