He held ice fishing derbies, baseball tournys, feasts, etc. This man helped everyone but especially children.  This year I decided to cancel the event because we lost another great member of our community, and in his name it was decided to hold an ice fishing derby in his honour.  Its upsetting but how can one run an event that makes people choose sides? Both events were scheduled for family day.  So I decided to postpone my event. So I as well as others can go have fun and pay their respects...  I just want to say a huge miigwich(thank you) to fishlogic, who sent an amazing package to go to a child angler as a prize.  When he first told me he could make a donation, I was thankful as always.  But when that package showed up I was blown away!  Quite literally it was a small tackle box, full of lures and components that many would be proud to have.  No idea of the actual worth but thats not important. But some child angler is sure gonna have a nice tacklebox thanks to him!  Im posting this because we all wanna see our kids or other kids learn to fish. And that depends on the great genorosity of parents as well as others.  Miigwich, and once donated im sure you will make a kid smile:) (and make his dad jealous lol)  OFC members rock!!!! And in this case, praise fishlogic!!!!!"

Im not joking, he sent such a nice, well rounded package.  Im very emotional just cancelling my friends event, but that generosity just blew me away.  Very humbling"

894892,Big Cliff,2015-01-29 23:32:00,6899,"If you look back over the years at what members of this family have done or donated for the benifit of others, it is astounding! It is however really nice to see that genorisity recognized!"
