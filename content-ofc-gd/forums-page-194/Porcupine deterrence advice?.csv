894321,manitoubass2,2015-01-26 19:43:00,11391,"See if you can borrow a trap. Frig those things arent cheap! I was called into trap a badger last summer, even though it wasnt my job. It was on a traditional burial grounds and I had the go ahead from the powers that be. Went to grab a trap and it was near 100 bucks. I wasnt sure about trapping it and I called the MNR and im glad I did. Apperently that was VERY illegal. But the MNR came and trapped it for relocation. Darn thing was digging up the burials.  Anyhow, there not cheap but I guess its good to have one around if needed"
894374,Sinker,2015-01-26 23:27:00,8692,"I have a trap if you want to borrow it. PTBO area, but I fish quinte often this time of year. Planning on going wed for the evening if you want to meet up somewhere.  S."
894376,Big Cliff,2015-01-26 23:33:00,6899,I am amazed thet there is one out moving around at this time of the year. I have a little pill you can give it called a .22. It won't come back.

894400,Gerritt,2015-01-27 01:00:00,6129,BG.... I have seen him for almost 2 weeks now. In the field behind my place.... Out there munching happily on whatever scrub is left....  Closest he has has come is within 20' of my backyard ( I back onto a small field and then a provincial park...)  Tieing my dog up Is not an option. Or even considered. ( he's on a electric fence) but I have seen him run if there is a threat regardless...  Going to see if I can relocate this prickly sucker  G
894405,Sinker,2015-01-27 01:08:00,8692,"I work the weekend coming, off the next, but isnt that the long weekend? If so, im not sure yet where i'll be. Could be quinte, but that itch has kinda been scratched, time for different water.  S."
894406,Sinker,2015-01-27 01:09:00,8692,"Pm me a number, maybe I can drop it off at your work or something?"
894465,Big Cliff,2015-01-27 12:11:00,6899,"I would be happy to do a transfer thing if that will help, I am going to have a few days off this week. I could get it from Sinker and get it to you."

Seems to be getting closer and closer to the property everyday...  How can I deter it from getting any closer? Tieing shopping bags to my hedges has not worked.  My property is not fenced just cedar hedges. I'm afraid to let the dog out for fear of a hefty vet bill...  Anything you guys have done. Or can suggest?  Thanks  G"

893932,ketchenany,2015-01-24 20:14:00,3229,"A lot of hunters here use the word 'bang'!  I had a skunk in my yard that dug a hole under my shed that was very close to a fence. I blocked any way in further and bought a  horn with different sounds. I built a trigger switch that he had to step on when he went in or came out  and this thing went off a 10 pm and again at 6am when he came back, it was loud :) according to my neighbour. This girl left has soon the kids could walk. You could spray the area with urine, it does work! Dog hair .  . ."
893940,Joey,2015-01-24 20:30:00,9122,"Just get a live trap G and trap it and take it a few miles down the road and let it go in the bushes.   I think you are only allowed to take them a few miles so that's why I say that, but you could take it further"
893943,highdrifter,2015-01-24 20:38:00,2534,Or you could just tie up your dog... just sayin..

894027,akaShag,2015-01-25 01:36:00,2073,"Baseball bat, or a two by four, or a shovel.....  They cannot move very fast.  And don't let any nosy neighbours see you.................................  ...............or if you have nosy neighbours, use a golf club and carry a ball with you for ""putting practice.""  Then make the carcass disappear.  You can lift a dead porcupine by its feet and not get quilled.  Good luck  PS)  Porcupine is pretty tasty.  I was looking for an old recipe for sweet and sour porcupine but couldn't find it.  And I cannot cut and paste in this infernal website, so you can google recipes for yourself.  But ""porcupine meatballs"" don't use porcupine meat, they use beef burger,,,,,,,,,,,"
