I wonder if someone made a calculation as to the stability of the ice with all 20,000 anglers and 20,000 holes that close together. Time to make Simcoe look like Swiss Cheese and put 30,000 ice nuts out there?  Only in America eh? Got to give them credit, very cool to pull it off.  If it was here and a perch fishery you are looking at a 1 million fish limit. Wow wa we wa."
894671,big guy,2015-01-28 12:22:00,414,not much snow out there either by the looks of it. ice is probably really thick without any snow insulating it.

894715,AKRISONER,2015-01-28 18:28:00,5558,are you not just totally destroying a fishery by hosting something like this? Or do they catch and release.
894717,Terry,2015-01-28 18:32:00,14456,it is catch and release but there are more people  then that  every weekend on simcoe when theres good ice
894725,mistaredone,2015-01-28 20:08:00,913,Not much of a fishery there anyways. 3rd place was a 2.8 lb walleye lol. Brutal numbers on the results
