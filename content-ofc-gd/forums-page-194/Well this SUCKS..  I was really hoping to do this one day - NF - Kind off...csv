846361,solopaddler,2014-04-08 03:10:00,8605,FWIW I'm doing what I can. Beyond pestering MP's I contacted OOD about this issue and will be writing a piece on this for the magazine from the perspective of the lodge owners that are directly affected. I would like to see the OFAH directly involved but not sure if that's going to happen.  I'm also going to try and set up an online petition to collect as my signatures as possible.
846422,mattybculp,2014-04-08 13:35:00,388,"I heard Angelo Viola speaking to some of the lodge owners last Saturday morning on the fan 590. It is truly devastating to these lodge owners , and I cant help but feel for them especially being a business owner my self. Imagine if they made it virtually impossible for people to access my business, I would certainly go under. I heard there was a petition Mike already started and I'm doing my best to find that link, its something we should support IMO."

846835,ctdd2006,2014-04-10 02:07:00,531,awesome stuff.  Nice to see the support...
847779,solopaddler,2014-04-14 16:17:00,8605,For all those concerned there's some great news!  Federal Transport Minister Raitt announced this morning that funding will be extended for one year for the ACR Passenger Rail Service from Sault Ste. Marie to Hearst. Now is the time for local stakeholders to get a long term solution -- the rail line is very important to this region!  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152142737998224
847793,NAW,2014-04-14 16:51:00,4022,Good stuff Mike! Thanks for keeping this post alive!  I'm not sure if signing the petition does anything.  But I signed it any ways.  Maybe others will too.
847884,sneak_e_pete,2014-04-14 21:42:00,540,I signed and its great to hear that a step has been made in the right direction!
847888,wormdunker,2014-04-14 22:02:00,1711,"I live in southern Ontario, but love the north country.  That is way north of Sudbury.  I fish a lot in the Gogama area.  This cancellation is definitely going to hurt the local tourist outfitters."
847900,ctdd2006,2014-04-14 22:34:00,531,Saw that on the news tonight.  Great stuff.  Now the stakeholders have a year to figure it out...I'm sure this is a last chance check.
894689,Algoma Guy,2015-01-28 15:43:00,19,Ok guys its that time again to put some pressure on Minister Raitt.  The feds subsidy for the Algoma Central Railway will end soon and  efforts to save the ACR for the long term have began.  A third party has agreed to take over the passenger and tour train and CN is on board.  They have a plan to make the train self sustainable in 5 years with new and exciting tourism opportunities.  I will provide some links below.  Please take a look and if you have the time maybe send a letter or two to our Minsters.

894700,moxie,2015-01-28 17:18:00,1566,Write MPPs? Wow!! Amazing what gets some of us fired up. We do care and situations like these are a real shame but  if its gonna cost me more than is already extorted from me and wasted im afraid i'd have to say find the dough somewhere else or look in another bucket.
894722,ch312,2015-01-28 19:26:00,1590,"Google is a great thing. One of the first search results for me was a detailed study on the ACR....  http://usaskstudies.coop/exhibit/wp-content/uploads/Algoma-Central-Railway-Wilderness-Tourism-by-Rail-Opportunity-Study.pdf    While it makes zero sense financially for the government to invest in something that is continually losing popularity, I would rather see tax dollars going towards something as beneficial to the local economy as the train service is."
894789,Musky or Specks,2015-01-29 04:10:00,2710,Well I know in the fall I found out Batchewana Trainstation Camp was for sale for a measly 30 grand I was very tempted.
894798,Algoma Guy,2015-01-29 13:48:00,19,The final demise of the ACR began when CN purchased the company and railroad.  CN is in the business of freight........9 billion dollars worth.  CN has no interest in running a passenger service and it has showed with the steady decrease in ridership.  The $2.2 million subsidy the government provided the railroad had been in place for years.  That number is peanuts for the both the Feds and CN.  This new plan is asking for LESS tax dollars and in 5 years the train will be self sufficient.  This should make everyone happy even the taxpayer.

842240,tb4me,2014-03-20 13:59:00,3295,Wow what about all the camps..I guess they are fly in only now. Sure is going to hurt business for many of folks.
842242,NAW,2014-03-20 14:02:00,4022,No kidding eh.  I wonder if they can still use the tracks and run people in on those rail trucks?  Or something similar.
842246,can u fish,2014-03-20 14:10:00,326,Well you can always take the Budd car that runs from Sudbury to White River it stops at many Lodges on the way with excellent fishing I did a trip a few years back on the Budd car and really enjoyed it you cant beat the scenery so there you go keep it on the bucket list but if I were you I would book a trip rather sooner than later as the Budd car is operated by Via Rail  and the Government can put a stop to it before you know it.  Cheers Mitch.....
842248,Acountdeleted,2014-03-20 14:18:00,2562,They have been making North East service less and less over the years. I remember when I used to be able to take the train from Toronto to Cochrane and then the bus to Hearst. It was so nice. Now its a super long bus ride.
842249,can u fish,2014-03-20 14:23:00,326,Well you can always consider taking the Budd Car which runs from Sudbury to White River I did a trip to a lodge a few years ago and really enjoyed it you cant beat the scenery so there you go keep it on the bucket list but if I were you I would book a trip rather sooner than later as the Budd Car is operated by Via Rail and that might come to an end before you know it so do your self a favour and book a trip on the Budd Car you don't want that bucket list getting too long anyway.  Cheers Mitch....
845421,123chadder,2014-04-03 21:47:00,165,im taking the budd train end of may!
845423,solopaddler,2014-04-03 21:58:00,8605,"This is devastating news! I honestly cannot believe they're doing this!!  There's numerous lodges that operate off the ACR and this will put them out of business. Beyond that hundreds upon hundreds flock north on the ACR every fall to see the colours in Agawa canyon.  This is a major blow to the tourist industry and frankly I can't see how the powers that be could let this happen!!  I feel sick, I'm tentatively supposed to be travelling north on that train in mid May!!  Total Bull!"
845438,chris.brock,2014-04-03 23:18:00,4053,"yeah that sucks, bad news for sure, lots of campers, camps and canoe routes will be affected  I've always wanted to do it too, I like the unique, small town Ontario stuff like that, it seems they are disappearing  what's next? the train to Moosonee? the Budd car? the Chi Cheemaun?"
845471,ctdd2006,2014-04-04 01:38:00,531,never hurts if some of you southern guys with northern hearts right your own mpp's as well as ours....we've been fighting up here for years feeling as though those in the more populated areas don't hear us or care....let those making the decisions know.

You're probly right on that order....we nearly lost the Chi Cheemaun last year and the budd car has doubled rates the last couple years. "
845474,NAW,2014-04-04 01:47:00,4022,Do other trains use that rail system?
845481,ctdd2006,2014-04-04 01:55:00,531,yes.  the rail line remains.  ACR is ceasing their tourist operations.
845564,tender52,2014-04-04 15:30:00,270,Thats gonna be a big blow!
845616,iFish4real,2014-04-04 20:33:00,386,somebody should build one of this

I agree! I guarantee you I'll be making my voice heard.
845634,bushart,2014-04-04 22:15:00,2628,You may wish to voice your opinion to your Conservative MP---it's a Federal cutback on Via to help balance the budget  Not MPP as indicated  Just sayin
845636,ctdd2006,2014-04-04 22:28:00,531,You may wish to voice your opinion to your Conservative MP---it's a Federal cutback on Via to help balance the budget  Not MPP as indicated  Just sayin But the MPP still has a voice and hates being trashed that he is letting this happen.  The provincial gov't can push the feds at times...moreso likely in an election year.  Just saying.  let both the MP and MPP hear you....it may be a federal decision but it affects the MPP's local delegates.  Not so black and white...
845637,ctdd2006,2014-04-04 22:30:00,531,....fill all their inboxes. It is a federal issue affecting those here provincially.  We in the north are misrepresented by the weakest party....we often get run over.  Not trying to start a political fight but when you have so few seats and most sit here....we can easily get runover.  What I meant by you southern folks well represented with northern hearts...

845720,aplumma,2014-04-05 12:18:00,6896,No Chris it is a true statement. The difference between the habitats is amazing. While a bass is a bass the difference between fishing up North and fishing for them down here uses different talents and techniques. The crisp mornings warming up into blue bird skies and crystal clear water in August are a relief from our fishing adventures here in the South. Don't get me wrong I am very happy down here and year round I prefer having 4 seasons that are equal and as winter sets in my desire of going North lessens. I am by nature and upbringing a warm weather person.   Art
