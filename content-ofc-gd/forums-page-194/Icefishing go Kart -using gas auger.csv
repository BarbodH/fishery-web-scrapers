895457,davey buoy,2015-02-01 18:59:00,5505,That would be great at the right price.Wonder if you could use your drill instead of a gas auger?.  .
895461,misfish,2015-02-01 19:31:00,29133,Interesting.
895462,Fisherman,2015-02-01 19:36:00,7201,"Ya, that's been posted up before,  does it comply with some sort of safety standards,  lights, brake, etc.  Then does it need to be insured for liability, and all those other things."
895463,misfish,2015-02-01 19:38:00,29133,What a downer you are.
895464,Terry,2015-02-01 19:39:00,14456,and damn hard on the motor too
895465,misfish,2015-02-01 19:42:00,29133,"and damn hard on the motor too  Not if you use a dirt drilling auger motor.  Think outside the box.  I have no need for a gas ice auger,remember? Oh wait,you used yours didnt you yesterday.      YUP,IM A SMART"
895467,Terry,2015-02-01 19:47:00,14456,the clutch and gearing isn't good for  that use just use  any motor would be good  an old snowblower maybe
