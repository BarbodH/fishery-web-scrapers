895199,Bondar,2015-01-31 04:36:00,817,"I have a pedestal seat in my boat for a butt seat up in the front of the boat, and the damn thing won't stay down anymore. I lean forward a bit and it's like an ejection seat shooting up like 8"" and almost pushes me over the side of the boat! LOL Is there away to fix , adjust these things or do I just scrap it and buy a new one? Thanks for any help!"
895201,irishfield,2015-01-31 04:40:00,26272,Sounds like it still has gas.... there should be an adjustment screw. Pull the seat off the pedestal. Turn the actuator screw in a turn or two. Sounds like when you sit on it the lever hits the screw shooting it up.
895213,Garnet,2015-01-31 11:54:00,2056,Hopefully the adjuster screw works.  I had 4 of these power poles in my scrap pile from 30 years of bass boats. I bought the manual lock one that's in the current Bass Pro shop flyer on sale for $35. Problem solved. Easily adjust never breaks and half the cost.
895231,moxie,2015-01-31 15:03:00,1566,Same here. My boat has Swivel-eze 238 bases and since I haven't grown in over 20 yrs I purchased a fixed pedestal and not an issue since. Good luck.
895241,Bondar,2015-01-31 16:06:00,817,Thanks! I'll check the screw adjustment
