Writing on the off chance that someone has had the experience of fishing on the lake - the ministry survey is only showing brown bullhead and white sucker. Any basic experiences and information about the lake would be much appreciated (basically, is there anything in there?).  Thanks so much.  Josh"

894552,saspirilli,2015-01-27 21:16:00,27,"I tried the stocking lists and there was no current information available. We'd be more than happy targeting smallmouth, just want to make sure that it isn't a barren body of water. Appreciate the response liverelease!"

894562,esoxansteel,2015-01-27 21:55:00,1307,"When you google it, northern pike keep coming up in real estate listings as well, which might be the demise of any trout stocking, bass do show up as well, no recent mnr stockings i could locate"

894637,saspirilli,2015-01-28 03:21:00,27,Thanks to all - was good to hear some first and secondhand accounts of the presence of fish in the lake. I wasn't sure whether to trust the (almost non-existant) info on the general web.  Always appreciate the feedback from the participants on this board.
