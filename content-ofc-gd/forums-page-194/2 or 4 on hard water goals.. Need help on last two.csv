Ice a whitefish 4. Catch a Ling (aka burbot)  After getting some great advice on laker tackle I managed to ice my first laker today.  What. A. Blast!! I'm already planning my next trip  Now, drivin home my thoughts shifted to two species that have always evaded me: whities and ling.  The frustrating part of this is that I taegetted whitefish today with meegs+tube and a small silver\blue Williams Spoon, only to have many sonar hits but no takers. - do whitefish only hit on the bottom? -should I be jiggin light, gentle 6"" jigging motions? - how can I 'play' a whitefish once they are on sonar?  For ling, Ive heard they are a Nocturnal species,meaning night is best. - is there a bait of choice? - will they regularly hit laker/whitefish tackle? - are they found on the same grounds as lakers/whities?  All tips/advice is GREATLY appreciated, I always pay it forward"

Ling, minnow or worm deadsticked on bottom at night, on a light jig head. 15-25 fow, mud flats or sand bottom  But I guess depths are all relative to where you fish"
894635,Moosebunk,2015-01-28 03:08:00,3970,Night is best for ling but not the only time.  They will hit laker presentations.  Pyzer had a solid article on the big lures for ling being go-to.  Talking 1-2oz jigheads with tubes or BIG heavy jiggin' spoons. Pound bottom with that.  You can certainly find them mixed with whiteys and lakers.
