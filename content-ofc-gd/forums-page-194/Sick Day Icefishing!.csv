894037,NAW,2015-01-25 02:27:00,4022,"We went out again today.  But I brought my girlfriend and her two kids.  Ages 2 and 7.  We open holed it on little lake.  7 year old girl starts screaming my name, and I look over and the rod is doubled over with a big fish on,!!  But I forgot to check my tension before I gave her the rod.., and it was cranked up, so the fish (likely a big gator) straightened the hook and swam away!!  Now she keeps telling me how she's a better fisherman than me!!!  Fresh air is amazing for children.  I really pity kids who stay I side all the time.  I"
894173,chris.brock,2015-01-25 22:03:00,4053,You're little guy is a trooper! Sounds like a great couple of days.  He should have been holding a beer can while parked on the pressure crack for extra flair
894178,misfish,2015-01-25 22:33:00,29133,   Good on ya getting them out Nick. Live life.
894196,esoxansteel,2015-01-26 00:07:00,1307,She might send you a pic laying on the beach between 2 muscular coco studs in buldging speedo's like the ones you see on the cover when you by a 3 pack of boxer briefs at Costco
894208,NAW,2015-01-26 01:23:00,4022,That would put a big old smile on my face!!  There ain't no going back!
894728,tender52,2015-01-28 20:27:00,270,Why diddnt anybody tell me that's what sick days are for. And here i'am not crawling out of bed till 2 this afternoon.
893722,NAW,2015-01-23 20:22:00,4022,"My 2 year old son goes to a daycare which is currently having a small outbreak of the flu.  So they are being very cautious (as they always are) and keeping certain kids home with mild/low fevers.  My son eventually hit 101.1 yesterday at 4pm, so i got the call.  He has never been ice fishing before.  We slept in, and I made sure he was in good shape.  No fever.  So, of we went to the hut for a few hours!  It was a windy walk out.  And glare ice.  At one point my son was in the toboggan beside me, because the wind was pushing him straight sideways.  We almost lost the sleigh and rods when getting in to the hut.  I had to go Steven Segal on the sleigh after the wind took it while I was unloading.  Anyways.  We caught about 30 perch in 2 hours.  My son asked me to put them back down the hole, so that's where they went.  Here's a few pics from the day.  The ride out!   The shiny new rig.   Every fish he saw he would say ""Back in there""  ""back down hole""  ""Fishy go"".   Dad/Son Selfie.   The ride home he faced backwards to avoid the wind his face.  I sent this to his Mom who's currently in Dominican.  She doesn't like him on the ice, so I parked him on the pretty crack for a picture.  There's ton of ice there. 12-14"" easy...   It was a great first run out with him.  He was very excited to see the perch, and could watch my rod tip and tell me when I was getting bites!  We may go again tomorrow.  On a side note, I tested out my new perch rod for the hut.  A Frabil Microlite 18"" with a Diawa crossfire reel.  It's slick!  smooth drag for a cheap reel.  Thanks for reading.! "
