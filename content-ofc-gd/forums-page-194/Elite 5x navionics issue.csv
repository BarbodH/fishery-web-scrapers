894828,BillM,2015-01-29 19:32:00,17367,"Same lake, same zoom level?"
894951,shimano19,2015-01-30 03:39:00,196,"Yupp, zoomed in and out aswell"
894953,ccmtcanada,2015-01-30 03:42:00,7971,Is it possible the map source changes from the navionics chip and the onboard lowrance maps?
894990,Terry,2015-01-30 10:32:00,14456,Is it possible the map source changes from the navionics chip and the onboard lowrance maps? that's what I was thinking too
894994,ecmilley,2015-01-30 11:48:00,2163,Sounds like its defaulting to lowrance maps makensurenyour chip contacts are clean and chip is seated fully
895031,BillM,2015-01-30 14:26:00,17367,Is there a way to disable the default maps?
895045,LucG,2015-01-30 15:20:00,779,"Sometimes this happens to my unit as well. I am unsure as to why, but I have figured out a solution that works every time. I shut down my unit, completely remove the chip, re-insert the chip, assuring it has clicked in all the way, then turn the unit back on. Works every time.  I've noticed it isn't difficult to ""unclick"" the chip accidentally, while trying to replace the rubber cover over the chip.  Hope this helps!"
895048,shimano19,2015-01-30 15:33:00,196,I will try all those options
