I was cruising the Lakeshore in Mississauga when I spot red lights in the rear view. @#$!!@$%^^^&&%!!!! I pull over by the Satellite drive in and get all my paperwork ready. The officer walks up to my window and I asked the officer what I had done wrong? I said I know I wasn't speeding and didn't run any lights.  He said you did nothing wrong, I just wanted to check out your ride, It's Sweet!!!!! We spent about 15 mins shooting the breeze and talking cars before getting on our way."

This would be thrown out in a second IMO.  Not sure if you can do that anymore?  I did it once about 15 years ago with a ticket for littering which was just as dumb.  Im walking on the sidewalk about 20 ft behind some teenagers. They were clearly drinking in broad daylight and had backpacks full of beer.  Cops pull up and of course they all drop their beers and run.  Cop writes me a ticket???? I explained myself and clearly had done nothing wrong. He wasnt having it. I even asked for a breathalizer to prove I was not drinking, nor was I part of that group. Nope, he wouldnt do it.  I went to the crown, explained in a few minutes and he dropped the fine just like that.  I cant even remember what the fine was, maybe $120 ish. No way was I paying that and the crown agreed"
894817,Canuck2fan,2015-01-29 17:22:00,1444,"It makes a person wonder is that police forces contract up for renewal soon? Might be a case of them pumping up the ticket dollars so they can say.

Or so say the politicians there who want to spend every nickel they can beg, borrow or steal from any source."

There should be some recourse where if you are found not guilty or the charges get dropped you get to recover your costs including your time at a rate of what ever the cops wages are!  I am glad to hear you are fighting it though and will be watching for the results!  Good cops are good people, bad cops are just jerks with a badge. Fortunatly almost every cop I have ever met was good people!"
895096,lew,2015-01-30 18:35:00,12766,"Fortunatly almost every cop I have ever met was good people!  I was coming east across Gerard St in Toronto one day and turned north onto Broadview right at the Don Jail.  As I came around the corner there was a cop car at the curb and as I passed him he pulled out, came in behind me and flashed his red lights. I pulled over and he walked up to my car. I joked that I KNEW I wasn't speeding & I KNEW I  hadn't run a red light and he laughed and said ""no you didn't, but you made an illegal left turn back there""  I apologized and said ""OK I guess you got me, I didn't realize there was no left turn there""  He smiled & simply said to pay more attention next time and have a good day Sir.  Your right Cliff, most are good guys just doing a job."
895099,ch312,2015-01-30 18:44:00,1590,"Haha, Good one. I wasnt speeding, and when he came and asked for my papers I had to ask why I was pulled over. To be completely honest, I was eating a hamburger. Apparently that wasnt a problem though.    Your mistake right there. Some police get annoyed when you start questioning their actions.  Devils advocate time...  Seeing as you were annoyed enough to ask why you were pulled over, would it not be possible that you showed a little attitude when asking said question? That's a surefire way to get the cop to look for any problem that can be ticketed and we all know there's 3 sides to every story..."

So many extremely bad drivers here.  I understand that proving a point is important to some people who are ""never wrong"", but why on earth are you even bothering fighting such a low value ticket with no points? Not only will you be wasting the courts time that could be used for more important thing's, by the time you factor in lost wages and gas you'll be lucky to break even if the ticket is completely tossed. Sometimes it's best just to suck it up and move on with life.  My dad think's in a similar way. He received a $150 ticket for hitting someone with a trailer while turning at an intersection. He just had to prove his point that it was the other drivers fault and the end result was the ticket was dropped to half and he missed a day and a half work. Just paying the ticket would have been less than half the total cost."
895105,Big Cliff,2015-01-30 19:13:00,6899,"He isn't the one that is waisting the courts time if he did no wrong, the cop is by issuing a bogus ticket. Sometimes it costs you money to stand up for your rights and all too often people just ""suck it up"" and pay the fine! If more of us fought these sorts of things they wouldn't happen as often."
895106,manitoubass2,2015-01-30 19:24:00,11391,"When I said wasting everyones time and money, i didnt mean that as a dig.  My point was go to the crown and likely have it dropped.  Remember this is costing him lost time at work as well, and if he did nothing wrong, well thats just stupid. And to go to court and waste his wage, just to likely have a judge call it bullcrap. Well thats just silly.  I just think approaching the crown saves money, and time.  But regardless I guess we pay all their wages regardless so...  Just my two cents"

That's a surefire way to get the cop to look for any problem that can be ticketed and we all know there's 3 sides to every story...  that's a little ridiculous. you have every right to ask why you've been pulled over without having to worry about some sort of retribution. asking a question doesn't automatically mean you're giving them attitude. no doubt the scenario you painted probably plays out that way often enough with the bad apples in the bunch. and in that case, fighting it on principle alone would be worth it, in my opinion."
895114,irishfield,2015-01-30 19:54:00,26272,"Issue is 312.. your insurance company doesn't care if it's points or not. 3 ""infractions"" and you get dropped like a stone.. refused coverage and then moved to another company to keep them from full filling the governments regulation that a company can't raise you more than 20% on premiums after 3 infractions. Instead they just drop you... then pass you on to a ""sister"" division at triple the rate.. ask my wife how that works.. LOL.  As noted a lot earlier in this post... I was through Peterborough that morning.. entered about 7:45.. left about 10:45.. Lights ON! Although at the time of infraction...and the pictures of the OP.. he shouldn't have been ticketed.  It's not always headlights for oncoming... many times it's no tail lights and you could drive right into the back of someone. It certainly wasn't anywhere near that bad on Saturday!"

Fined 110 dollars for not having my lights on at 1:50 in the afternoon.  Took this picture while pulled over.    He cited section 62(1) on the ticket,  Lamps required on all motor vehicles except motorcycles62. (1) When on a highway at any time from one-half hour before sunset to one-half hour after sunrise and at any other time when, due to insufficient light or unfavourable atmospheric conditions, persons and vehicles on the highway are not clearly discernible at a distance of 150 metres or less, every motor vehicle other than a motorcycle shall carry three lighted lamps in a conspicuous position, one on each side of the front of the vehicle which shall display a white or amber light only, and one on the rear of the vehicle which shall display a red light only.

BUT.. they were out looking for money, as I left the TSC store on Landsdowne St East.. 5 cops.. 3 cars in the parking lot pointing 2 radar guns down Landsdowne to get folks going East in the 50!  Today wasn't probably worth the ticket.. and I'd fight it with that picture as you can see at least a 1000 feet!

893990,Terry,2015-01-24 23:17:00,14456,you need daytime  running lights on  if vehicle was equipped  but not head or taillights
893991,Parnelly,2015-01-24 23:17:00,108,"Definitely a bad call in my opinion, And I will be seeing him in court.  My daytime running lights are always on. They come on when the vehicle is started. Even in my old civic, as soon as the e-brake was released the drl's would come on.  He claimed it was inclimate weather, and I had my windshield wipers on.

I also have a perfect driving record, and have never had any problems like this before. (knocks on wood)  If he really wanted to get me, my Ford Escape, has a lock on the receiver which is full of salt, and I cant get the key in it. Hitch is on all the time. I would have gladly taken that one."
894022,Fisherman,2015-01-25 01:10:00,7201,"And why would you get a ticket for a hitch in the receiver.   There was a bunch of Yorkie Porkies that went nuts giving tickets for that last year, Judge threw them all out, told the fuzz to get a life."
894025,Parnelly,2015-01-25 01:25:00,108,Im guessing this will get tossed as well.  As soon as he signaled back on to the road he cut 3 lanes and rounded a corner pulling another truck over for the same thing. That truck also had its running lights on.
