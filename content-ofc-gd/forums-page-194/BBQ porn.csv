895360,manitoubass2,2015-02-01 02:19:00,11391,Ive done your typical shorelunches which was easy enough. Ive done new york strips pretty easy as well.  Id like to cook some pork shoulder etc not over an open fire but just the coals
895410,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-01 14:42:00,8243,"I don't smoke much meat but my BBQ did come with a smoke box and it works fine. I wish it was a bit bigger though. I just add more wet chips in a pie plate covered with foil and a few slits. I can do a good size shoulder or butt. To do anything larger a dedicated smoker would be best.  M2B2, I have built a few open fire pits for friends as I have a bricklaying background. Dad was a bricky and I've been mixing mortar since Kinder Garden. Do you intend on building a chimney for the pit? If so it can get tricky if the mantle is at the wrong angle sometimes. Of course everyone besides me has one that I built. I figure I can get too much meat on it and then would have to invite everyone over to share it! Actually the Italian in me insists on cooking for more than a dozen guests an I love having those get togethers with the 2 sheets of plywood put together and piled with 6 courses of food on it and several jugs of wine. Dean Martin and Al Martino on the record player in the background of course. I guess it would be an IPod now. I love those summer feasts. The old days are the things we do today that we will talk about tomorrow."
895412,manitoubass2,2015-02-01 14:58:00,11391,"Im not sure yet OI.  I haven't drawn up and plans but it will be made with rock, not brick.  I've built many fire pits for others but never with the intent of it being cooked on.  I know brick would be easier to level, but I like the look of rock slab much better.  I know I can get it level, I once did a 200ft retaining wall and had great results, just takes more work and creativity.  Maybe ill start looking online for some picture ideas. Not today though!"
895413,Salmonidstalker,2015-02-01 15:10:00,265,I only bbq from spring to fall and cook inside all winter long as i like the art of cooking in all forms.  It gives me something to look forward to all winter and too much meat definitely isn't healthy.  But the only way to go is charcoal in my opinion.  I'll never go back to gas or propane; so lame.  Manitou - I made a fire pit using rounded landscape brick from Home Depot.  Cost was under $100
895415,manitoubass2,2015-02-01 15:20:00,11391,"VXP,  I already have the rock so im sticking to that. Its blast rock so its pretty easy to work with.  Also, isnt brick fairly porious?"
895417,Blue Lk,2015-02-01 15:30:00,337,"If you plan on grilling meat over a fire it you have to watch what type of wood you use.Imo,softwoods wouldn't be very good. The trouble with this part of NWO is the shortage of hardwood type trees,maybe that's not the case in Fort Frances area. I've grilled over birch coals & the result wasn't too bad."
895420,manitoubass2,2015-02-01 15:51:00,11391,"Ah very good point ive totally overlooked.  What are the best woods to use?  Ive always just used whatever, just like camping. Silly i never thought of that as a variable"
895470,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-01 20:18:00,8243,"You can build a great BBQ pit that will last many lifetimes out of stone/rock as long as the base and sides are made of firebrick and the proper motar. Stone is added to the exterior to make it look nice. If you have the hearth and mantle, also referred to as the bosh of 100% stone the heat will spall the stone, crack it and with the constant cycle of rain/snow then heat then moisture and reheat constantly it will eventually crumble. It can be done without firebrick but and may last a few years but I guarantee it won't last as long as you would hope it to. I can go into a long explanation of the science but don't need to unless you want me to. There are many sites out there that may help. Don't forget if it's on the Internet it has to be true."
895474,manitoubass2,2015-02-01 20:26:00,11391,Hahaha. Nope shoot me all your advice. Id much rather build it proper the first go

Propane, gas or charcoal. Neighbour had the fire dept at my door the first time we lit up the pit last spring. Now I make sure I throw up extra smoke when running the smoker."

895280,dracokaos,2015-01-31 20:41:00,116,"I currently have 5 BBQ's. 2 for tailgating, they are just small Weber propane's. I have a Weber Summit we got 2 years ago. Great BBQ very even heat and tons of space for entertaining. I have a Big Steel Keg (bought prior to Broil King buying them) charcoal bbq. Its great for cooking low and slow or I can get that thing scorching hot to do up some steaks. I recently bought a dual fuel smoker, propane or charcoal. Much easier to control the heat so thats where i do my long cooking pork shoulders etc. My next purchase (don't tell the wife though lol) is gonna be a La Caja China (china box) I love cooking whole hogs and this baby will do one in about 4hrs and makes the best crackling ever. Hope to have that for the spring.  I'll post some pics of the BBQ's a little later.  Now i got the hankering to cook!  Cheers guys!"
895297,Sour_Squirrel,2015-01-31 22:26:00,196,"Here's a picture of my other Weber. Not as fancy as the one in the first post.  It's an old Weber Silver C that's about 12 yrs old. The only thing I had to replace was the flavourizer bars.  I'm smoking a couple of pork tenderloins on it as I'm writing this. The second picture shows the cast smoker box on the right and a foil pack on the left.  Both are filled with cherry wood chips.  I have a two stage smoke setup.  The right has dry wood chips and the left has wet wood chips.  The dry will smoke and burn off first and by the time that happens the left will start to smoke.  This way I don't have to open the lid half way thru the cook and add more wood chips.  I've tried cherry, alder, hickory, apple but I think pecan gives the best flavour. I ran out of pecan that's why I'm using cherry today.....    "
895299,akaShag,2015-01-31 22:39:00,2073,"back to Sour_Squirrel..............  I have been smoking meat, fish, etc for over thirty years but always have used a dedicated smoker.  How does that work with a BBQ?  I am guessing you'd have to set the heat down quite low so as not to dry out the stuff being smoked, BUT you need enough heat to make the wood chips smoulder.............  and what the heck are flavourizer bars????????????  TYIADoug"
895303,Sour_Squirrel,2015-01-31 22:56:00,196,"The Weber Silver C has three burners. One in the front, one in the middle and one in the rear.  It's opposed to some grills that have a burner on the right, centre and left side. Flavourizer bars are what Weber calls the bars (piece of stainless steel the length of the burner that's bent into a V) that are above the burners.  The burners heat the bottom of the bars and the heat is radiated throughout the bottom of the bbq. The bars also prevent flare ups.  If grease drops down the bars are covering the flame from the burner so the grease doesn't have the chance to ignite.  When I use this bbq for smoking I have the smoke box and foil pouch at the rear over the rear burner while at the same time the other two burners are off.  Basically I'm cooking the meat over indirect heat.  That way the meat isn't over any direct heat and the meat doesn't dry out. The heat of just the rear burner is enough to get the wood chips smouldering --> smoke and flavour !!  Depending on the outside temp I have the rear burner between half and almost high.  It's enough to maintain a cooking temp between 225-230 F."
895307,akaShag,2015-01-31 23:04:00,2073,"back to Sour_Squirrel..............thanks for that.  Where does one buy a smoke box like that?  (Or probably I could use an aluminum pie plate or similar, if you are using aluminum foil for some of the chips?)  Thinking I might give the (natural gas) BBQ a try to smoke some ribs.  My smoker has smaller racks than this BBQ so I have to cut a rack of ribs into three or four pieces to put the smoke to them.  But a full rack of ribs is nicer to deal with (and I think has better flavour).  Hmmmmmm.........  But I don't see myself selling two scoped rifles to buy one of those Green Egg machines..........  Doug"
895308,Sour_Squirrel,2015-01-31 23:09:00,196,"I bought that smoke box from Lowes. You don't really need one.  A foil pouch works just fine.  Just use some heavy duty foil and wrap the woods chips with it and poke some holes into it using a fork or knife.  I've cooked many full racks of ribs on my bbq. Again, it works on my bbq because the burners run front, centre and rear.   I don't think you'd be able to fit a full rack of ribs if your burners are left, centre and right depending on the size of your bbq."
895309,Sour_Squirrel,2015-01-31 23:19:00,196,The tenderloins are done !!   
895332,akaShag,2015-02-01 00:37:00,2073,"back to Sour_Squirrel............yeah you are right, the burners on that BBQ are left centre right, and a full rack of ribs takes up the entire width, so the end with the lit burner (and smoke) would get burned.  The GOOD news is, my BBQ is just about ready for retirement, so I can look at a few new-to-me features that I am learning about here.  But I still can't see selling two scoped rifles to buy one of those Green Monsters.........  Doug"
895354,manitoubass2,2015-02-01 02:02:00,11391,Does anyone cook on an open fire?  I mean aside from fish and beans while camping.  I wanna build a nice firepit and it seems to me that it would be an awesome way to cook.  keeping that heat nice and even might be a challenge
895355,Sour_Squirrel,2015-02-01 02:10:00,196,The key to good results is temperature control.  With an open fire it's almost impossible. I'm not saying it can't be done but it would require constant attention.
895357,Sour_Squirrel,2015-02-01 02:16:00,196,You can always cut the racks in half and put the halves on the side with the burners off. But that goes against what you wanted to do - bbq a full uncut rack of ribs.  But like you said it gives you an excuse to shop for a new bbq.....

894937,Sour_Squirrel,2015-01-30 02:56:00,196,It's natural gas.  I would think that if I had the propane model that it would be going through tanks of propane very quick.  I have a second Weber that I use for smoking.  It's a older Weber Silver C. I recently discovered adding smoke to meats improves the flavour. I'm just using a cast iron smoker box made by Brinkman.  The wood chips I buy from Cdn. Tire for about $5-6 a bag.  My next purchase will be an offset horizontal smoker.  That'll be later this year......

A propane BBQ I am supposed to use in the winter but can't. I went to take the brand new Merry Christmas cover off just Sunday. It has tightened so much since I put it on the only way I will get it off is with a good knife and the 3rd is an old gas unit I laid a metal backing dish (that my wife can not figure out how it disappeared) to in to hold charcoal. Too late Sunday to get the coals going but it is the best really for a real BBQ, gas is really baking not BBQing. Another word that doesn't really exist.  edit, I wonder how my wife would feel if I bought her a shower curtain for Christmas?"

The pork in these pictures went on the spit at 180lbs (dressed weight) and took approx 16 hours to cook; using cherry wood coals made in a burn barrel beside the BBQ. No wonder I don't have much time to fish; I did 2 pig roast last year and I think there's plans for 3 this summer.  Dan.   
895015,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-30 13:53:00,8243,"Sour Squirrel that's a nice unit you have. You get what you pay for. I know a guy that buys a $199.99 CTC special every other year. BBQ's are like big screens now, they drop in price every year and in quality. They look nice and shinny in the store and last maybe 3 seasons. Lucky if you get enough heat to do burgers and dogs. For that they are OK I guess.  Dan that's not a BBQ I'm sorry to tell you. That is a BBQ pit. The boys out here have a community pit we built that is built into  trailer we can haul around by truck. We do local shin digs using whole pig, lambs and a good portion of a steer. We did 3 goats on it once. And 45 chickens I think it was. It's a lot of work and we basically charge cost for anyone in the community. Restaurants that call, well that a different story, money can be made.
