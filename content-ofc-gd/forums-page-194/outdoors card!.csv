For the past 5-6 years they kept sending me the wrong card, and ive tried to right that numerous times.  Id always receive a green outdoors card and didnt even realize it was an issue until being pulled over by MNR while crappie fishing years back. I was legal to fish but they said this was a non resident card???  So I went to the local office numerous times with proof of ontario resident. They were pleasant to deal with n all, but again Id receive this card???  I used to live in alberta for work but that was 7-8 years ago lol.  Anyhow, I just got my updated card and its right this time!!!! YAY???  Good job MNR??  Card looks alot different this year"
894496,chris.brock,2015-01-27 16:40:00,4053,"my new one is green, is this the wrong card?  I liked my old one with the turkey on it better"
894497,BillM,2015-01-27 17:04:00,17367,"Turkey one was WAY better then the current one..  But what can ya do, it's a card that's in my wallet 99.99% of the time."

894501,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 17:07:00,11391,"I was told it should be blue, not green."
894502,BillM,2015-01-27 17:07:00,17367,"Green is the hunting/fishing combo card.   So yes, definitely green if you've got a hunting license as well."
894504,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 17:14:00,11391,Thats the problem bill. I dont have a hunting license  Might be chris's reason for a green card though.  Im just gonna call them and make sure its the correct card.  Even where I purchase my license/card it shows up im non resident
894505,BillM,2015-01-27 17:15:00,17367,They are trying to tell you something
894506,Sinker,2015-01-27 17:26:00,8692,I was impressed with how quick my outdoors card came. My passport too.....had it in 5 days. Now to renew my PAL....this one will take a while I would suspect. Sucks I had to renew everything this year. Its cost me a fortune!  S.
894507,Bondar,2015-01-27 17:26:00,817,"Mines green, hunting and fishing"
894508,chris.brock,2015-01-27 17:30:00,4053,They are trying to tell you something  This discussion just turned political
894509,Woodsman,2015-01-27 17:30:00,1286,You don't need to have a hunting license to get the hunting version of the card. All you need is to have the authority to get a hunting license.(eg. proof of an approved hunter safety course or have purchaced a hunting license in the past)
894510,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 17:33:00,11391,Yeah I suppose ill leave ontario lol. Bill hates me like im an ottawa fan???  So I just got off the phone with them and everything is correct
894512,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 17:40:00,11391," I need my PAL as well.  The costs keep piling up, but in all honesty its still worth it.  My outdoors card showed up in 21 days. Not as quick as most ive heard of here. But still good enough"
894513,Mister G,2015-01-27 17:51:00,1429,Since I have never been asked for one I stop buying them.
894514,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 17:52:00,11391,"Uggh, pass me a beer and a rod?"
894515,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 18:01:00,11391,Gi-nisidotann na?  Billm ogimaa giigooyikewinini  ????
894516,chris.brock,2015-01-27 18:02:00,4053,Smiley face= just bugging ya' Rick  the beer and rod idea  does sound a lot better than heading into work though  I'm not sure what that means but I have a feeling Bill will be skunked on his next outing
894518,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 18:04:00,11391, Ill wait and see if anyone can translate my last post?
894534,irishfield,2015-01-27 19:16:00,26272,"And for those that have a gun license coming due.... make sure you get it renewed as if you don't... and it's a possession only.. it's gone and you'll have to take the PAL course etc to get one back.  I heard the ""greeter"" in Cabelas  (that you surrender you gun to at the door) telling guys they were going to role anyone with just a Possession Only automatically to a PAL in the next round. They figure you can already possess, buy ammo and fire the dozen you already possess, why shouldn't you have the ability to buy more."
