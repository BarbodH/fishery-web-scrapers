894525,Terry,2015-01-27 18:36:00,14456,just like simoce on a slow day lol
894526,crappieperchhunter,2015-01-27 18:49:00,2582,That's Simcoe on a good day Dave.  Before I had my fish trap to hide in...I had people cut holes closer then that to me when I was having a good day.
894536,irishfield,2015-01-27 19:18:00,26272,Like the day the guy started chipping the hole open RIGHT in front of Terry's Clam door!! lol
894538,fishnsled,2015-01-27 19:33:00,3520,Crazy video Dave.  They use to have something similar on Simcoe where the 1st place prize was a new truck.  Don't think that is going on anymore.  That is priceless Wayne!  lol.  A couple of years ago we had punched a bunch of holes for the group I was fishing with and had some guy just walk up and start fishing them. Chipping a hole in front of the hut has that beat hands down though.  I'm sure Terry would have some words of encouragement for that guy.
894544,Brettiop,2015-01-27 19:51:00,279,"I'd fish it, the prize list is unreal....would be a cool experience."
894549,Jds63,2015-01-27 20:39:00,1365,"holy crap , wonder what its like from the fish's point of view  .. lol probably more of a social gathering for charity than fishing anyways"
894553,misfish,2015-01-27 21:31:00,29133,They have one here in Barrie.  I like fishing the area after the tourny. Lots of open hole to use.LOL  http://www.icefishingbarrie.ca/
894555,davey buoy,2015-01-27 21:40:00,5505,Any fish? lol.
894629,irishfield,2015-01-28 02:42:00,26272,"Temagami did a 1000 holes from the town dock almost out to my place for the CTV derby, one fish caught! LOL. We just stayed clear of the whole thing..."
894652,mike rousseau,2015-01-28 05:57:00,4661,We have one in alexandria that's over 1000 anglers every year...  50+ places get prizes... 1&2 are 4 wheelers... There's guided fishing and hunting trips... All kinds of great prizes  That being said... With 1000+ people fishing a small pond/lake for pike it's pretty much a lotto...
894657,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-28 09:03:00,8243,Looks like a double thread on the same subject. Crazy.
