So want to make sure they are biting better this year before I spend any more money. Any info would be great.  Thanks"
894845,Sinker,2015-01-29 21:05:00,8692,"Im wondering the same. If you find out, let me know.  I prefer tim hales over floyds, but right now I think I'd go with Steves out of pefferlaw. He usually runs huts for perch out a little deeper than most, and I think that's where the perch are. The bite has kinda sucked in closer. Its worth a phone call for sure.  S."

895019,John Bacon,2015-01-30 14:11:00,3277,"I think the bite varies from week to week day to day, etc.  Picking the right day is more important than picking the right year.  Don't go on the same day as me if you want to catch fish.     Every time I have been to Simcoe the fishing has been bad for everybody."
895022,miami,2015-01-30 14:18:00,29,"Sinker is correct. My wife Susan and I fished Last Saturday and Sunday (same area) 2kms out of Beaverton Harbor. 34 fow both days. No dinks - everything we caught ranged from 10 to 14"". We released 2 - 14"" - the 3rd blew the bladder so no go. We started with jigs 1st - nothing. We switched to minnows and in they came.  We were approx 500 meters from FHales farthest huts out.       "
895038,Sinker,2015-01-30 14:55:00,8692,Nice haul miami! And thanks for confirming! Find some hard bottom with gobies and the perch will be with them.  S.
