894778,moxie,2015-01-29 01:43:00,1566,"  It,s amazing what those have to fight for today,what was a given, years ago. A Town Bylaw Office was shamed into standing down on an issue with some public pressure. My 77 yr old Dad who lives in the neighbour hood was pleased the rink stayed and proud to see people rally to save it.  Anyone see the power of the people and how easy it is to turn bureaucrats into pussies? Another example that illustrates to me the sorry bunch we are when we fail to affect change to more important issues than whether frozen water should have a border of specific height."

Naturally her parents had to sign a consent(waiver) but I picked her up at her bus stop & all she could talk about was all the fun she had & how fast she went

People will complain, you're right, but those same people should then be told ""if you don't like it, don't look at it"".  I don't think I said that, however if you want to go down this path should you break the law then try to change it or start by trying to change it...the law is the law if we choose to break some, can we really be pissed that we got caught and there is a price to pay as I said I do not agree it should be removed, but I do see people complaining all the time and am no longer surprised then the call bylaws  sitting here whining yourself that it isn't right . isn't going to help either.....the laws need to be changed and they really don't need to br told don't look at it it's going to be gone , so they don't have to"
893913,big guy,2015-01-24 19:10:00,414,"Yes wormdunker, but this issue goes far deeper than having a rink on the front yard, it's about people having the freedom to do what they want on the land they own, without having Mr. & Mrs. Perfect down the street complaining about the ""unsightly"" blue tarp."

So what if it's not their cup of tea, will it really kill them for 2 months? The bottom line is, the kids are the ones that lose out.  And speaking of the law, what kind of law can charge someone up to $25,000 for a 16x20 rink on a lawn, yet people abuse our natural resources and get slapped on the wrist?

I would be on the ice skating...but I really do understand someone who thinks front yards need to be perfect, complaining...."

Maybe with the publicity they are giving it Ajax can be shamed into leaving well enough alone. I particularly liked he term ""craphearts"" that was used in the first piece to describe the complainants.  From the first piece: ""Because if there is a rule that says an ice rink filled with children violates some kind of appearance standard, then that rule is self-evidently wrong. And the politicians responsible for that rule — and the bureaucrats who report to them — ought to change it, immediately. Voters ought to make it clear that if the politicians will not stop this removal order, then the voters will order the removal of the politicians at the earliest opportunity.  There comes a time to stand up on your skates and drop your gloves, a time to say “no” to the craphearts and killjoys and their flunkies.""    http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/01/23/take-our-hockey-rinks-from-our-cold-dead-lawns-keenan.html  http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2015/01/26/why-is-ajax-taking-a-family-hockey-rink-into-the-boards-editorial.html"

Those places barely topped out at $280k when first built are now being sold in the $700k range. There are more than a few busy body nosy prick like humans there who feel their dung smells like roses because the market has over valued their shacks in what used to be a corn field and those are the thorns that dont understand to leave well enough alone and let the kids have fun."

A neighbour a few doors is building a rink in his backyard and no one has problems.  What I get from these rink stories is that if they built the rinks in the backyards, it probably wouldn't be a problem. I have no idea why they put them in front yards other than to say 'hey look at how cool I am, building a rink for my kids'"

If she's an engineer, she could frame some 2x10's over the pool and built a rink there  maybe have a fire pit going as well for warming up. and I know this is heresy around here but if she really wanted her kids to have exercise as a lifelong component to well being, then I'd suggest she put her kids on skinny skis and get them into classic or skate. upside is you're outside in the trees vs front yard. ymmv  but yeah, her mistake was the boards. next year she'll know better and let the neighbour stew in misery while her kids enjoy the rink lol"

It seems I was part of the last generation that actually went outside and played with sticks and rode bikes til dark without anyone really knowing where we were and it was ok, when it was dark... go home.  I can't believe the direction this world is now going, it's disappointing to be able to really do nothing about it, except my 14 month old boy will be outside playing, hopefully with a few other kids!"

Winter is tougher then summer, in the summer I couldn't pay them money to come inside haha.  One thing they do know however is that if your inside your doing chores or helping cook/bake.  They do have tablets and one of those xboxs but its all put away in our room. They get a couple hours a week on them and thats about it.  I see way too many kids these days that are raised by a video game or tv, and thats just sad.  ps. If we had an outdoor rink in our yard I would have a hardtime going to work ???.  as a kid my grandpa used to flood this bush area and all us kids could be found there basically all day when we weren't at school.

893896,woodenboater,2015-01-24 18:35:00,2277,"Last word on this (maybe). I get the sense that some people think if there were no front yard rinks, kids would become lazy slobs sitting in front of computers or tvs all day.  If a rink is that make or break for their health, then kids are doomed. It takes more than a small rink to get kids healthy and fit. Skating helps (ANY physical activity helps) but I'll bet nine times out of ten the kids chow down on chips and candy or guzzle litres of soft drinks when they come inside. This is a one step forward two steps back approach to fitness and health.  If the woman really checked the bylaws, she would have noticed the boards would be a problem but imo she rolled the dice and lost.  Get all soft drinks (and sugars) out of kid's diets and we'll talk."

When it got dark we went home to watch the leafs WIN!  Yup they had a winning team back then.  Our parents always knew where we were.  I feel there is way too many indoor activities for youngsters today.  Computers, xbox, tablets etc.  They talk about obesity in our younger children today,  Just take a look at their activity levels & amount of junk food they consume.  That tells the whole story!  Just my opinion."
