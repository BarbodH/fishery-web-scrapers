893045,irishfield,2015-01-20 05:10:00,26272,..unless of course you're allergic to wool!
893055,Yellow Fever,2015-01-20 11:59:00,139,"Well why not also look at prevention....they crack because they are dried out so you need to wear gloves. Like everyone else hear at one time I got them but started to put  hand cream on numerous times aday (Okeefes is greasy) if they get real bad put vaselene on before bed and were some cotton gloves, keep at it and wear gloves."
893076,Bluegill,2015-01-20 14:45:00,197,I get the same crack in the tip of my thumb.  Every ice fishing season.  Exact same spot.  
893109,OhioFisherman,2015-01-20 16:54:00,6623,"I worked on truck docks and drove an 18 wheeler all my adult life. No heat on the truck docks and two pair of gloves were normal, leather gloves over fabric ones. My fingers would dry out and crack, the key was using a moisturizer like Vasoline intensive care, it would prevent it as long as I used it regularly."
893124,cram,2015-01-20 18:06:00,1733,Udder butter.
893133,EC1,2015-01-20 18:50:00,930,"Got the exact same thing going on for my right thumb this year. Polysporin seemed to do the trick for me - just remember to apply it as soon as the crack forms.  Just so happens that it'll heal for me throughout the week, and the next time I go ice fishing it opens up again."
893139,craigdritchie,2015-01-20 19:11:00,1586,One more vote for O'Keefe's.  Buy it at Home Depot. Stuff works.
893150,NAW,2015-01-20 19:45:00,4022,"Thanks again everyone.  It sounds like I just need to apply cream lots until this crack goes away, then keep my fingers greased up/covered up as best as I can.  I just hate wearing gloves, specially when perchin on Simcoe when you don't go 30 seconds without catching a fish and needing to take your gloves off again.  I guess I should just stick to the slab grabbers, because they are really easy to pop fish off with out removing your gloves."
893535,bassnass,2015-01-22 17:31:00,174,"I work outside and also icefish.  I used to have the same problem really bad - for years and years.  Clapham's salad bowl sealer is what worked for me.  It's a combination of beeswax and food-grade mineral oil.  Every day before I go outside, I'll apply it by smearing it across my finger nails then quickly spinning each finger (& thumb) tip in the finger tips on my other hand - then I wipe my finger pads & palm on the back of the opposite hand and just leave it like spackle in the crevices underneath and around my finger nails.  Absorvbs after a while and seals your hands pretty well.  I tried all kinds of creams (not the O'keefe's, tho) and even used to super-glue the cracks closed.  Clapham's is what did it.  And it's all-natural and edible.  Doesn't seem to bother the fish either - as far as scent.  GL"
893539,bassnass,2015-01-22 17:45:00,174,"Also - stayin hydrated helps too.  Like, with actual water. lol"
893559,NAW,2015-01-22 19:13:00,4022,Thanks Lincoln.!  What's wrong with using Vodka to keep hydrated???  I don't see an issue with that?
893955,wormdunker,2015-01-24 21:23:00,1711,"Hey Nick lottsa good advice here.  I've work outside in the construction industry my entire life.  Here is where the problem begins.  Your hands get wet from handling snow covered lumber & other materials, then they dry out.  Then the cracks/splits begin.  Winter is a drier climate as we all know, then you put on dry leather gloves, this compounds the problem.  Wool gloves are also the enemy as they are dry as well.  Catching a perch every 30 seconds - I wish!  Now your hands are wet, then they dry out without any ""lubricant"".  I had many splits at the end of my fingers that were very painful & would not heal.  It was at this time I discovered ""Neutrogena"" hand cream.  The label states ""Norwegian formula"" in red lettering.  Many years ago their product label stated it was formulated for the Norwegian fishermen.  More recently that description has been deleted.  It's available at Shoppers Drug mart.  Apply it several (5 or 6) times per day to get the healing process started, once starting to heal you can cut back on the # of applications per day.  I don't care how bad your hands are at this point Neutrogena will work!  I always have 2 or 3 tubes nearby in the winter.  Why - CAUSE IT WORKS!"
893958,manitoubass2,2015-01-24 21:32:00,11391,Fish oil would help as well.  Everyone should be taking it anyhow
894069,Meegs,2015-01-25 11:38:00,249,I hardly use gloves on the ice and I'm a electrician by trade.  Have my hands on cold metal pipe almost every day.  O'keefes is the only thing that works and works quick.   Couple days and hands are like new
894077,NAW,2015-01-25 13:20:00,4022,"Thanks for all the replies everyone!!  I picked some Okeefe's from Canadian tire this week.  Been maybe 4 days now and the crack is almost healed up completely!   So thanks again for the info, I'll be recommending this stuff to whoever asks in the future."
894450,'Kota'sDad,2015-01-27 03:52:00,7,"Corn Huskers lotion. Apply liberally and rub it in until it's absorbed. Good stuff. Here in the states it's available in any drug store, but I don't know about north of the border. It's relatively easy to get on line."
892852,NAW,2015-01-19 15:45:00,4022,"I get the same crack in the tip of my thumb.  Every ice fishing season.  Exact same spot.  It started at the beginning of the season, and stays till the end.  A little back ground, I have about the weakest, nancy office hands you could imagine.  But I rarely wear gloves on the ice, so my skin takes a beating.  Does anyone else get cracked up fingertips?  Do you do anything about it? Does anyone have any suggestions to treat this so it will heal up and GO AWAY?  It makes it hard to text with my phone with the big split up the middle of my thumb.....  I know it sounds silly asking you guys this...  But thought it was worth the shot."
892853,cram,2015-01-19 16:34:00,1733,Try udder butter or bag balm.  Not kidding.
892856,206,2015-01-19 16:41:00,563,Funny I just saw an add on TV yesterday and was wondering if this was any good? you can try it and let us know lol  http://okeeffescompany.com/index.php?page=working-hands&gclid=CLKhi8u_oMMCFQyPaQod3yUAKA
892864,bow slayer,2015-01-19 17:00:00,1074,as bad as the name sounds bag balm works good also go to tsc and grab some udder cream also works great.
892867,grizzlybri,2015-01-19 17:08:00,565,"i use a product call crack doctor, works great, its a cream that you just rub onto the needed area"
892876,mitch seguin,2015-01-19 18:03:00,98,O'Keefes has worked the best for me.
892880,Rodbender,2015-01-19 18:13:00,1027,O'Keefe's is awesome
892881,irishfield,2015-01-19 18:18:00,26272,Come over and tend to my place next summer... and do some wrenching in the garage for a bit with me...and you'll be just fine for next winter Nick!
892896,NAW,2015-01-19 19:33:00,4022,"thanks guys!!  I'm going to grab a can of the O'keefe's.  Looks like you can get it at home depot, and Canadian Tire.  As for Wayne's suggestion...  I think that's possibly the worst piece of advice I have ever been given in my entire life.... Thank you.  Now.  I will come kill turkeys on your property!  Does that count?"
892901,Rod Caster,2015-01-19 20:07:00,5784,"My friend is a mechanic and takes bentonite (pills?). He says it helps a lot... not sure if it's prescription or not.  I'll give you some of my wife's homemade lip balm when we meet up for fishing, it works good on hands too."
892905,manitoubass2,2015-01-19 20:28:00,11391,Good man/women  Makes his own solution  I salute you RC (and your better half)
892912,NAW,2015-01-19 21:08:00,4022,"Hey Chad, That sounds great!  Do you make it the same way they make the soap on the movie Fight Club?  Can't wait to taste it!!"
892916,aplumma,2015-01-19 21:12:00,6896,You can also use lanolin it comes from sheep wool and it works great.   Art
892927,fish_fishburn,2015-01-19 21:38:00,1311,Polmolive dish soap.    Rub Vaseline on em twice a day.
892928,Rod Caster,2015-01-19 21:40:00,5784,"Good man/women  Makes his own solution  I salute you RC (and your better half)  Yep, she's good at doing that. Made our own bugspray last year too (although it didn't work super well) Hey Chad, That sounds great!  Do you make it the same way they make the soap on the movie Fight Club?  Can't wait to taste it!! ha, fight club! Let's hope she's not plotting anything haha.  Looking forward to the nip trip! I'll hook you up."
892934,Fisherman,2015-01-19 22:02:00,7201,"And when all else fails, boob cream, crack cream, crack sealer and you still have the corner thumb cracks like grand canyon crevises, go and get some ""Amantle"" cream, it's not cheap and you have to order it from the US.  It's about $15 for a 1 oz tube, good for the winter. Matter of fact, I even tried the 100% udder cream right from a farmer, did nothing but make greasy thumbs."
892943,woodenboater,2015-01-19 22:27:00,2277,"If you already have cracks and it's causing pain, aside from Okeefe's, use New Skin to seal it up a bit so it does open up any further. While it doesn't heal splits/cracks per se, it does keep it from getting worse. Or you could try crazy glue...  Bag Balm is not bad but super greasy and didn't make that much diff for finger tip cracks."
892985,NAW,2015-01-20 00:49:00,4022,"Thanks for all the replies!  I have tried glueing it, but it always just cracks and starts bleeding again."
892987,aplumma,2015-01-20 00:55:00,6896,You can in the evenings put lanolin or your favorite cream on and then a pair of rubber gloves/ finger cotts to give them a chance to heal.   Art
892989,Nipfisher,2015-01-20 00:58:00,2449,"Nick, my mitts stay in the hut and I clean my holes with my bare hands. Plus I work in the cold water almost every day of the winter. I use the O'Keefe's Working Hands before going to bed. It works best if it doesn't get rubbed or washed off. Some guys at work swear by Bag Balm."
892990,manitoubass2,2015-01-20 01:03:00,11391, For cracked skin I'd honestly just dip in olive oil or coconut butter
892993,porkpie,2015-01-20 01:16:00,2521,"I have about the worst hands imaginable in the colder months.  I got frostbite at work years ago on both hands, and they've never been the same since.  It starts at the area that was frost damaged, and works out from there as soon as it gets cold.  My wife started buying me Aveeno exzema care.  Of all the creams I've tried, including the working hands stuff etc. this is the only one that has worked relatively well.  Keeps my hands in reasonable condition, and soft enough that they don't crack as badly around the fingers and thumbs.  Not cheap, but its worth a try, good luck!"
892995,manitoubass2,2015-01-20 01:22:00,11391,Haha I use that when I shave off my beard??  Very good easy to find product
892999,35Wailin,2015-01-20 01:42:00,59,"Bentonite is clay.  My mother in law swears it works by rubbing on the affected area, but I have my doubts.  She uses it for every possible skin condition as well as stuff like arthritis and other internal ailments."
893019,Roe Bag,2015-01-20 02:53:00,246,NEW-SKIN  liquid bandage  http://www.newskinproducts.com/  Comes with a brush and is applied like a clear nail polish. Instant relief for those exposed nerve endings. Seems to promote healing as well. Spend a lot of time outdoors in the Winter. Best thing I've ever used.
