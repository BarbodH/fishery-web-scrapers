It's the employees that are hit the hardest, maybe just bought a new home for the family, works everyday to keep the Wolves at bay, just trying to make ends meet, to get let go at anytime is sad, very sad. It always seems to be around the holidays. Business owners know they are done weeks maybe months before and try to stretch it past Christmas often. I know we did get past New Years before closing the doors when we had a small business after I retired. It may be an accounting strategy depending on the fiscal year. I remember handing out lay off notices at the plant December 1st one year, 91' I believe, a few guys here might remember all too well. Here Merry Christmas this is your layoff notice and by the way here is your voucher for a free turkey at Fortino's. Some times knowing the guy well and knowing how they struggled working full time I knew it was going to be very tough for them. Peoples lives are ripped apart. That was something I never wanted to ever have to do again, never. That I will not forget. I want to see any CEO or President of a company personally do that at Christmas, actually hand out a pink slip at anytime and with my big yap told one of them exactly that, it probably cost me many thousands of dollars down the line, actually I was told it did. I better stop my rant right here.  I don't know the product but just looking at their website they looked serious. I once attended a meeting and an individual from the bank gave us some numbers that I will never forget. He said of all small business start ups in Ontario 90% will go under within 3 years and of the 10% that remained 60 to 90% of those will go under within the next 2 to 3 years. He had the documentation to quantify his statement. That was in 2006 before the financial crash.  I hope they can bounce back somehow and Mr. Zhou's personal matters are resolved as to get the folks back to work as soon as possible but the future of that company is bleak as it appears there is no future. A sad day indeed."
