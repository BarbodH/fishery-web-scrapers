894613,spincast,2015-01-28 00:46:00,3279,where'd I put that bucket list? what a river
894664,Big Cliff,2015-01-28 10:38:00,6899,"Wow, third time out? That is amazing!!!!!!! I can't do much of anything with mine, I don't think I've had a flight yet that didn't end in a crash!"
894665,Terry,2015-01-28 10:41:00,14456,it's landing where i have the main trouble  I was told to try hovering at a height you can reach and just grab it and shut it down
894666,misfish,2015-01-28 11:18:00,29133,I would say hoover it at about 40 feet. But a moving target is more challenging. KABOOM.
894668,Big Cliff,2015-01-28 11:44:00,6899,"it's landing where i have the main trouble  I was told to try hovering at a height you can reach and just grab it and shut it down Oh I don't have any trouble landing, that always happens!  It's getting it to fly again after the landing that I have a problem with!  So here is how to solve your problem; try hovering at about 1"" above ground then land"
894687,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-28 15:31:00,10439,Here is a good one my buddy did last spring. Spey fishing of lakers in Alaska.  http://vimeo.com/98921519
894702,Ralph Field,2015-01-28 17:26:00,1018,"Wow.........some great footage, Thanks for sharing x2"
894731,misfish,2015-01-28 21:15:00,29133,Here is a good one my buddy did last spring. Spey fishing of lakers in Alaska.  http://vimeo.com/98921519  Wow that was super clear as well. Very nice.
894748,Big Cliff,2015-01-29 00:04:00,6899,That was all done from a quadcopter? AMAZING!!!!
894784,Sharkbait22,2015-01-29 02:28:00,297,"Wow.  Can't get enough of the aerial footage.  Whole different point of view which offers a new learning experience, not unlike sonar or underwater cameras. Those lakers are pretty too.  Any idea what the lakers are doing in the river?  Looks like spring."
894785,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-29 03:27:00,10439,"Wow.  Can't get enough of the aerial footage.

Looks like spring.  It was June 21st. Best guess is feeding. Spring is when the salmon smolt start to move out to the ocean."
894792,tb4me,2015-01-29 06:01:00,3295,Here is a good one my buddy did last spring. Spey fishing of lakers in Alaska.  http://vimeo.com/98921519 that was awesome too..Man i gotta get me one of these things..
895190,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-31 03:39:00,10439,This one just popped up on my Facebook feed. Retirement can't come soon enough. This is where I will call home in my work free years. I gotta get me a drone too.  http://vimeo.com/116831579
895209,tb4me,2015-01-31 07:22:00,3295,"Fantastic! You can say what you will about the HD footage from these Drones, but the video editing in that last one , It was amazing in its own..."
894458,tb4me,2015-01-27 05:41:00,3295,I thought this was done so well it was worth sharing..I hope you all enjoy this as much as i did...
894459,knightfisher,2015-01-27 05:59:00,237,"That was great.  Smart idea, and put together very well."
894461,misfish,2015-01-27 10:43:00,29133,Wonder how many pennies I need to save up for a trip like that?  That was cool.
894462,solopaddler,2015-01-27 10:49:00,8605,"Already been thinking about a drone and fishing the Alagnak, so this video was really interesting! Thanks for posting."
894466,Yellow Fever,2015-01-27 12:14:00,139,I think I might have a chance catching a fish there....then again
894477,BillM,2015-01-27 14:31:00,17367,I love walking and wading!  Great vid.
894482,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 15:19:00,11391,Wow! Fish just stacked right up  Great video!
894485,Algoma Guy,2015-01-27 15:49:00,19,Very cool! Total different perspective.  Wonder how long it will take to make drones illegal for fishing and hunting?
894486,Jds63,2015-01-27 15:50:00,1365,I was thinking Mike should get a drone ...  those drones really give an amazing perspective on videos now ... very cool ....
894488,mistaredone,2015-01-27 16:02:00,913,Great vid!  Sign me up!  I'm hoping to get my buddy and his drone out next year to get an aireal of a big Muskie follow in clear water.
894500,NewHips,2015-01-27 17:07:00,111,"Wow.........some great footage, Thanks for sharing"
894517,Terry,2015-01-27 18:03:00,14456,great control of the drone
894519,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 18:08:00,11391,One of my buddies flys drones and we wanted to shoot some footage with my gopro of the sturgeon spawn.  I couldnt bring myself to do it though cause if it goes down thats all she wrote for my camera.  Must take alot of practise to control a vehicle like that.  Some real beauty shots in there!
894520,Terry,2015-01-27 18:14:00,14456,"you can cut up a pool noodle  and make 2 pontoons for the drone it will float a soft landing but a crash is a crash  people, where I fly my drone all call me Crash, don't know why   yeah I do"
894523,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 18:31:00,11391,Yeah but the heavy current would likely take it down like f all. Even life jackets dont save you there.  Id love to do it though if we could find a safe way.  Hes a very good operator but he has his doubts as well(his drone is obviously worth more then my camera).  With this technology we'll see all sorts of cool video footage! Exciting stuff!
894539,adempsey,2015-01-27 19:34:00,1498,"Very cool!    I've read plenty of horror stories of people crashing their drones on the first day.   That would be me, lol."
894540,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 19:37:00,11391,
894541,fishnsled,2015-01-27 19:41:00,3520,"Some very cool footage!  Ya, I'd crash it as well and at the price of them, I could not afford to keep replacing it after every flight.  lol.  I've thought about getting a cheap one to try though.  Maybe find a 2 for the price of one deal."
894542,Terry,2015-01-27 19:46:00,14456,"I have damn near rebuilt the whole thing with replacement parts I had heard trees jump out at kites, I did not know they grab drones too"
894545,manitoubass2,2015-01-27 19:52:00,11391,Hahahah
894569,fishnsled,2015-01-27 22:13:00,3520,"I have damn near rebuilt the whole thing with replacement parts I had heard trees jump out at kites, I did not know they grab drones too  The trees just want to keep up to date with the technology Terry.  Bring a chainsaw and they might leave you alone."
894581,tb4me,2015-01-27 22:33:00,3295,Terry what Drone do you own? Id love to know a little more about them?
894584,Terry,2015-01-27 22:44:00,14456, The trees just want to keep up to date with the technology Terry.Â  Bring a chainsaw and they might leave you alone. it's climbing 50 feet in the tree thats the killer  Terry what Drone do you own? Id love to know a little more about them?   Walkera QR X350 PRO GPS RC Quadcopter Drone FPV Devo F7 G-2D
894585,misfish,2015-01-27 22:47:00,29133,I can see why they get shot down. LOL
894586,Terry,2015-01-27 22:49:00,14456,this was the third time I  tried to fly it
