894440,landry,2015-01-27 03:24:00,1005,May be too good to be true but saw this today. Barely used 2013 Mec 150 4 stroke for $4500. If you are looking for a motor it is worth a call at least.

894444,John Bacon,2015-01-27 03:30:00,3277,Interesting; he wants something bigger than a 150 hp on a pontoon boat???  I don't think he going to get high performance from a pontoon boat regardless of how horsepower he puts on it.  That may work out well for the buyer of his old motor though.
894447,ecmilley,2015-01-27 03:36:00,2163,Seen a pontoon last year with a 300 suke on it
894448,2 tone z71,2015-01-27 03:41:00,1311,Yep there's a few toons with 300 yams on em on the bay too
894456,mattaw,2015-01-27 05:09:00,162,Some people have a need for speed. I have seen a few with 250s and 300s on them. Beats me why though...
894457,HTHM,2015-01-27 05:27:00,4082,"Scam. I saw a real good deal on a boat, and it turned out to be a scam. That is a 12K motor all day long."
894467,Muskieman,2015-01-27 12:20:00,2472,"That sounds too good to be true .. but it could be . A friend of mine has a 24' Tri-toon and also has a 300 on the back , it'll do 65+ mph , has all the anemeties of a house boat ( almost ) .... I'd buy one if I could ."
894478,Bondar,2015-01-27 14:49:00,817,"This is the email response you get    Hello,  I must tell you, from the beginning, that I have moved to Munich, Germany because I have finished my work contract. I have worked in Canada, for one year and now I came back home. I hope this is not an inconvenience. If you are interested in buying, then I will answer your questions and I can arrange a delivery to your location, of course free of charge.  Thank you"
