Make sure you have a barrier to prevent insects and animals to entering you roof system.  G  Is that the foam used to plug the openings due to the ridges in the steel roofing?  Is any additional barrier required?
894439,DRIFTER_016,2015-01-27 03:24:00,10439,"When I was in grande prairie, I looked at houses and 300,000 for a 1800 sq ft house built like s%×+.  The newest subdivision here in Yellowknife the places are selling for $400,000-$425,000 and that's for trailers that are so close together you can practically touch your neighbour from your kitchen."
894441,mcdougy,2015-01-27 03:25:00,274,"Hey fellas, been a while since I have posted.....ice fisherman...you have received the green light that steel is a longer lasting product than shingles, everyone agrees.  The ball is now back in your court...you have to do more homework and look at the available products, to decide which suit your home. This is the only way you will get accurate numbers. Companies will measure your roof and give you an accurate quote. There is a wide variety in products and the cost reflects the differences. IMO I wouldn't recommend the metal products that are covered with pebbles / asphalt. It can't stay on, and fade is a real possibility. I'm not trying to be gruff, but your question is too vague to get an accurate answer at this point. Some of the major players in the steel roof market are Vic West, Ideal steel products. You will see the wide range of products available from just two companies, let alone the hundreds of smaller manufacturers.   Cheers M.M."

If you are in the Kawarthas or general area I can hook you up with the guy that did my roof. He did an excellent job with all the ""critter barriers"", trim, and those things to keep the snow from sliding off the roof and on to your head.  My house is about 1500 sq ft with a couple of valleys and ti cost me about $5500.00 all in.  The best price I could get doing it in shingles, stripping the old stuff and everything was $4900.00.  Check around your area, go and talk to others in your area that have had their roofs done in steel, call a couple of the local suppliers and ask them who has the best reputation then get them to come and give you written quotes. Do not pay any money up front, the guy I dealt with didn't ask for nor did he want a deposit. His response was ""when the job is finished and you are satisified then you pay me""!"

I don't know any of the roofers in your area but we do have some guys on the board that gave me some excellent advice when I was looking into it. If you get referances and actually go out and see the jobs they have done it will give you a pretty good idea of what to expect.

894527,wormdunker,2015-01-27 18:50:00,1711,"Don't buy shingles from a big box store.  They won't last.  I've been there!  25 year shingles lasted only 9 years before showing wear.  After 11 years I had to replace my entire roof.  The warranty only covered to replace the shingles.  I had to do the labor to strip old shingles, haul them away, pay for disposal & of course install the new shingles.  Prior to getting approval for replacement shingles I had to take pix of my ventilation for the attic including roof vents, soffit vents & pix of my attic to show I had adequate insulation up there.  Quite an ordeal to say the least.  Go with the metal roof as others have already stated.  If I ever have to do my roof again - METAL ONLY1  Good luck"
894314,icefisherman,2015-01-26 19:18:00,952,"Maybe a bit early but starting my home work ahead of time can't hurt too much. Most of the neighbors have already replaced the shingles on their roofs. Few including me haven't done it yet. All houses on the street were built about the same time withing a year (11 years ago).  I've read some old posts here (Big Cliff the latest) but can use more specific information pretending to my particular house...house is over 3300 sq. feet including finished basement. Asume about 1100 sq. feet per floor. House is in North West GTA/North Halton. As I said 11.5 years old. No leaks but wife says she has noticed some shingles curling on the garage roof. So it maybe getting close to the time of replacement. Question is with WHAT?  Simplest and cheapest I assume will be to put shingles again. But curious to see how much more would be to use metal/aluminum roof instead? Not sure how long we'll stay in the house...not planing any moves at this time but who knows what happens few years from now.  Roof is fairly steep, not sure of exact pitch. There must be roof experts who are members here and can hopefully shed some light on the issue. Even offer a quote? Below is Google space shot of the roof if it helps.    Would appreciate any advice and input you may have...I understand there are different varieties of metal roof, different thickness, but all more of less with life time warranty? Trying to figure out if it is worth paying bit extra not to have it to repeat this exercise again in future. Feel free to PM me if you wish.  Thanks,  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
894325,Big Cliff,2015-01-26 19:53:00,6899,"Go Steel! In the long run it cost me about $500.00 more (about 8%) to go with steel than have my roof stripped and re shingled. I know that when the time comes that I do sell my house that I will get that money back no problem.  In the meantime, I have enjoyed lower cooling bills in the summer time (the house stays much cooler now in the summer) and I have the piece of mind knowing that I will never have to worry about my roof again!"
894328,John,2015-01-26 20:09:00,2956,"In general terms a metal (standing seam or aluminum shingles) will cost 2 to 3 times that of standard shingles. I am no expert but this is based on 4 year old quotes. I went with 30 year architectural shingles, about half as much again as standard. Cedar shakes or shingles would be similar 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 times. Concrete tiles can look nice depending on the style of the house but I would make sure I got a structural engineer to take a look at the roof construction to see if it could bear the extra weight, If the existing roof needs to be stripped count on another $1000+. There are MANY ""weekend cowboy"" roofers out there, particularly trolling new (ish) subdivisions, get some references and recommendations from friends and neighbours."

894338,Sinker,2015-01-26 21:10:00,8692,"IF you can afford it, put metal on it. Period.  Done deal, never have to deal with it again, and good for resale as well.  I can't believe your shingles are toast after only 11 years. They are probably 25 yr shingles too. Such a rip off.  If you re-shingle, you will have to strip what you have off, and take them to the landfill, and pay by weight. Shingles aren't light! And they don't degrade in a landfill. Leave them on there, strap right over top of them, and put on metal.  The question regarding keeping the house cooler in the winter, the answer is no.  The reason it stays cooler in summer is because of the air space between the metal, and the old existing shingles. If the shingles don't get hot, the roof stays cooler, which in turn keeps the house somewhat cooler.  S."

When you start to consider cost look at : cost to strip, dispose of the old ones, the cost of ice and water shield (if done properly). Replacement cost (because they will not last as long as the warranty but who keeps a warranty for 10+ years and even then it doesn't cover removal and labour, just the new shingles).

Shingles just don't hold up , and the warranties really aren't worth the paper they are written on. Subdivision roofs are built to be as cost effective as possible for the builder. In other words they meet code. many builders will allow you to upgrade if they have not already put up the roof. Up sell just adds to the profit margin. I've only put up a few metal roofs some 20 years back. They were properly plug screwed, critter baffles in place, powder coat, full sheet.  They still look brand new. The one on my buddy's barn still keeps everything bone dry.  Even if you pay 25-30% more than shingle pricing. Consider the other costs to reshingle that others have already mentioned.

The air in your attic should always be the same air temperature as outside, if you notice your roof melts snow while its still cold out and your roof won't hold the snow without melting it, increase the ventilation because it does the same/opposite in summer and helps curl those shingles up,  Tl;Dr proper insulation and venting will extend the lifetime of your shingles"
