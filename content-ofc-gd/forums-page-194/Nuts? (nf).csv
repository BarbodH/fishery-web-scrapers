894554,Old Ironmaker,2015-01-27 21:37:00,8243,"Another ""Come on Man!"" story. What I would love to know is whom exactly is the ""Name Police"" in these places? Someone sits at a desk in Hotel DeVille in where ever and says "" You can't name your child Moon Unit because they will be confused with Frank Zappa's daughter in the US. I must admit there are some whacked out names given now as well as before. If a kid doesn't like what they are being called then the kid calls himself something else. I liked my name until I went to Kindergarden and Walt Luker said my name meant sh!tter. Somehow I survived. What were my parents thinking, for heavens sakes?  I guess I could go on about this story but there has been enough energy wasted powering the communication devices telling it.  Little Sh!tter, John D."

894597,Lape0019,2015-01-27 23:47:00,647,Went to a school with a guy named Nacho and he didn't seem to have a problem with it. I can't see Nutella being any worse.  I also do not think a courtroom should have the right to say which names you are not allowed to use. Should t they have more I portsnt things to do?
