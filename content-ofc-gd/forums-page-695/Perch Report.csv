458272,Stoty,2010-04-20 22:20:00,2910,"In spirit of the Orillia Perch Festival, I decided to head out and try my luck at landing a monster perch from Simcoe (not in the festival)  This was my first time fishing Lake Simcoe for perch, and I have to say that I am quite pleased with my results!  Both my buddy Grant and I each set new PB Perch. Mine weighed in at a whopping 1.8 lbs, and his just under with 1.4 lbs.  So far in 2010, I have set 3 PB's - Walleye, Crappie & Perch Let's hope the PB's continue!  Here are some shots from today!  Me with my PB, and another jumbo   Grant with his new PB "

458508,Stoty,2010-04-21 17:54:00,2910,"Thanks guys, it was a blast for sure. I was hesitant about going out and targeting perch...but wow, I was impressed with the aggressiveness and the fight they put up! I literally thought I hooked into a bass when I had my PB on. I was shocked when I saw it coming up and it was a perch!! I enjoyed it so much, I think I will get out there again in the next couple days!"
