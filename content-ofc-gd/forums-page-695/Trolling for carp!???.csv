The last time I caught a pike in this lake was around the time of y2k computer bug. Rest assured that no pike coming out of this ""lake"" ever looked as healthy or was even as remotely large as the pike on my profile pic.   At times the waters can be this bad in the late spring."

458682,hammercarp,2010-04-22 06:48:00,964, Carp will hit lures but this is an odd occurance.I also caught a 12 lb pike on carp bait. So what.  Carp will school very densely in winter and early spring. You were not getting hits you were snagging fish as you trolled through a school of them.
458686,splashhopper,2010-04-22 10:20:00,2931,"  Hey Teach,,,, i think you are hung up on theory( see research)  Lots of carp fishermen gave their experience to you and you blew them off.  There is an old saying that seems apropo here:  Those that can't TEACH,, those that can DO !  Keep surfing the net, maybe you WILL find the answer that YOU want eventually. Happy ""trolling"""
458689,TC1OZ,2010-04-22 10:43:00,987,"“Those who can’t do, teach.”  That's the saying and it seems very appropriate."
458692,scuro2,2010-04-22 11:12:00,904," Yes, hung up on theory and there is a good possibility that the naysayers are right. That I'm only going to foul hook them if I try and troll. But I do research things, allow me to share.  Why troll?   Moving trolled baits permits anglers to present those baits to many more fish than anchoring and waiting for catfish to rely on their sense of smell to approach.   If the catfish are scattered, as is often the case, chances are moving along productive spots, in contrast to sitting on a single location, will present bait to many more catfish.   And, trolling the way Mac does, presents baits to a variety of depths, searching out the spots where catfish may be on a given day.   At times the range of depths may be as great as 5-feet on the shallow rig and 45- or 50-feet on the deepest. http://www.timmeadfishing.com/Archive.php  Tim uses herring at the end of his rig but he does troll for cats.  Gary LaFontaine reports watching trout in the shallows of a mountain lake.  They would cruise along and suddenly change direction to begin rooting on the bottom and another leech would become trout fodder.  It took him a while to discover how the trout knew where to root.  It was a small puff of silt stirred up when the leech moved.  He used this information to design the Bristle Leech -- a leech imitation that sits on the bottom but creates a puff of silt when retrieved.  The Bristle Leech catches not only trout but also carp and the mechanism that triggers a strike in both fish would seem to be the same.  Bonefish anglers know that bonefish also look for puffs -- shrimp, crabs, and the like moving along the bottom of mud flats and creating a small cloud with each jerky move.  A common technique is to cast in front of a bonefish, allow the fly to sink to settle to the bottom, and then give about a short pull on the flyline.  The fly rises up off the bottom and creates the puff of silt.  A bonefish, even some distance away, can see the puff and rush over for a meal (your fly).  My experience with carp is that they respond just like the trout and bonefish.  As they cruise along the bottom vacuuming up what they find, they are also watching for fleeing prey.  Perhaps it's a crayfish scurrying out of the way or a leech or a mayfly nymph.  But carp will see their puff of silt and charge after them.  I saw this graphically demonstrated one day when I was fly fishing for bluegill off the end of my dock.  My fly was an olive nymph with bead chain eyes.  It resembles both a crayfish and a dragonfly nymph.  I looked on the bottom about 6 or 7 yards out from the dock and there was a carp, just sitting there facing me and gently finning.  I cast the nymph about 4 or 5 feet in front of him.  As it sank he paused, and, I assume, watched the fly drop to the bottom.  But he made no move until I gave the fly a twitch, creating that little puff.  The carp took the fly in a flash, and, realizing its mistake took off for parts unknown.  Unfortunately I was using a light rod and tippet and had no hope of controlling the fish.  It broke off in short order.  I have since caught lots of carp (and one catfish!) using just the following techniques:  choosing a fly that sinks to the bottom hook point up and stirs the mud or silt when twitched;   either sight casting to carp in the shallows or blind casting to an area where I have groundbaited; and using very slow, short retrieves with long pauses in between. https://www.msu.edu/~connert/carpfly.htm  This dude reports that carp respond to puffs of silt on the bottom like bonefish. I have experience with bonefish so this seems very possible. So why wouldn't carp respond to a micro long lipped plug that was slowly trolled on the bottom? A kayak is ideal for this because it can get in very shallow without making noise. Carp are a spooky and intelligent fihs. I'll let you all know how it works, your doubts have me questioning if this can work so I am very curious now."
458739,mepps,2010-04-22 15:13:00,1301,"I have carp on Rapalas and Mepps lures, never trolling though. To be honest, not sure it would be worth the trouble if there are other species around that are out of season."
458757,Governator,2010-04-22 15:37:00,879,Or you could just wait a month and try the technique then?
458762,fish-miester,2010-04-22 16:01:00,864," early this year I was trolling and casting for Pike and thought I was having hits.. but I soon realised that they were schools of carp.. and well I'll be honest.. they had me convinced they were pike.. my buddy even snagged one in the back with a spinner bait and we were convinced it was a pike.. untill we got it closer to the boat.. though I have seen carp either smack at a lure.. or inhale the lure momentarily..  but I personally think trolling for carp isnt the worst idea in the world.. if you are using the right stuff.. for example.. i deffenetly would not be using a spinner bait or sumthing like that.. instead I would be slowly ""dragging"" or bottom bouncing a ball of corn, worms or mixture.."
458835,Afraz,2010-04-22 21:07:00,250," You know what this might actually work, esp if you are dragging baits/lures (that look like carp bait) through the bottom susbtrate as it will push up a lot of debris and potential food items for the carp (sorta like a chumline for your presentation).  But honestly, if your lake is as bad as the pic you posted. I would have issues even handling these fish LOL let alone trying to target anything or even troll in the water. What if your kayak tips and u inhale a large mouth full, God forbid what would happen LOL.  But yeah, dude troll all you want just make sure your presentation is not such that it would entice bites from other species, Don't troll husky jerks or anything the like thereof. Unless well w.e, a lot of things are taboo until someone has good results, people used to use potatoes for carp, i heard folks Sprawed WD40 on lures to attract fish too, who knows whats going through the mind of a fish, heck i have had Pike on Corn when targetting carp. Is that to say i am a lying OOS pike fisherman ?  Lmao, good luck !"
458843,GBW,2010-04-22 22:03:00,8460,"Thread closed any time soon?  It's a waste now as the OP asked a Q and now is telling everyone that the reply isn't what he/she want's to hear so they are going to try it.  lock it down, this is sad...  I guess you can't teach and old dog new tricks ater all..."
458847,scuro2,2010-04-22 22:22:00,904," I've always thought it has potential. Again I could be totally wrong. Best time to fish this lake is now till about the mid-end of June. After that it can look as bad as that pic although most years it doesn't. So this lake really only has about a two month window. You can still catch carp in it but they lose their spunk and the water gets skanky...like milk with blue green paint in it. The lake is shallow and warms up quick.  I do fish pike often so I know where they hang out. Earlier in the season they will be near some sort of cover, point..etc. On this lake you have a blanket like condition for carp. My thinking is fish the unremarkable areas, not near bends or points. Carp are literally turning up the whole lake in the search for food. I've got a micro yo-zuri deep lipped lure. When I was on lake Erie the water was only about 3ft deep and they were hitting small yo-zuri crystal minnows. I figure the lipped lure will get me a little deeper. The troll will be slow...as slow as I have ever trolled. Think about it, your a carp and spending a lot of energy digging up the bottom and then right next you see a flash of a small wounded baitfish....slurp. Bone fish are also bottom feeders. They will have their nose right in the bottom but if they see an easy meal they have quams about taking small fish. Any thoughts on the slow troll and small plugs would be appreciated. Some sort of crayfish looking plug..."

458850,Roy,2010-04-22 22:28:00,13728,Your're right Geoff....long overdue. We have people working hard keeping/getting our resource as healthy as possible and then we have others looking for loopholes and grey areas in the regulations. It's a shame.
458433,scuro2,2010-04-21 13:52:00,904,Had a recent experience in trolling for pike where I believe I had a carp on that wasn't snagged. Now in my local waters most of the fish are out of season except fish like carp. It is mostly a carp lake. I plan to fish small lures at a slow speed. Anyone ever do this? Also there is the danger that I could actually catch a pike out of season. How would one explain this to ministry guy if he ever saw you trolling and you catch a pike? Almost all carp fishermen use bait like corn.
458435,TC1OZ,2010-04-21 13:56:00,987,That would be a first for me.  Good luck explaining that one to a CO.
458439,Fisherpete,2010-04-21 14:10:00,1814,"Yeah, might be a pretty tough sell to a CO... since you would almost certainly catch mostly OOS species rather than the target carp and they obviously know this. I have caught a few carp over the years on moving baits as well, but it is the exception rather than the norm."
458440,scuro2,2010-04-21 14:16:00,904," The thing is this ""lake"" is more like a runoff pool and very nutrient rich. There are probably 30 carp for every pike and I feel confident that I could mostly, if not exclusively catch carp. I'm not big on sitting on my arse dealing with slimy bait and watching my line for slight vibrations."
458451,bassjnkie,2010-04-21 15:20:00,1101,"It does work, I've caught carp on Mepps. A friend of the family fishes G-bay a lot for carp and only uses spinners. I can't see why trolling a slow speeds won't work. As for the MNR, well I can't help you there."
458458,The Urban Fisherman,2010-04-21 15:41:00,2050,"I fished the Thames river in london with moving baits for 3 years strait while in school and caught hundreds of smallmouth bass, dozens of pike, and 1 tiny carp.  I did however catch hundreds of carp, BIG and small much more consistently on corn.  If you fish them properly the action will be much more fast and furious than casting for hours and hours with a stick bait or spinner.  It's obviously possible to catch carp on moving baits, but you're seriously diminishing your odds targeting them with spinners or cranks, and are knowingly increasing your chances of catching OOS fish.  I don't think a CO could realistically ticket you for targeting carp with a moving bait, but if he see's you catching pike while ""targeting"" carp you're probably going get yourself into trouble.  Good Luck either way!  Cheers, Ryan"
458489,young_one,2010-04-21 16:58:00,620,Sounds like trouble   Are there other species of fish you can target? To be able to catch a variety of fish is what makes any fisherman great.
458512,Sudzy,2010-04-21 18:19:00,88,"I caught a monster carp in the Hamilton harbor years ago trolling with big spoons for trout.  I would think it would be a rare thing to happen though - not sure how a CO would treat that one, always thought the not ""targeting: OOS fish was kinda a fuzzy regulation."
458517,TC1OZ,2010-04-21 19:10:00,987," Like everyone said, that's a tough sell. No offense, but I think the carp people have determined the best ways to target carp and trolling with a spinner bait is not one of them/not considered targeting carp. You should check out some carp gear. They have line monitors so you don't have to watch your line for bumps/vibrations. There are many specialty rigs out there. If you use store bought boilies and ground bait... You will never have to touch anything slimy or deal with making them!  As for sitting on your arse... how is sitting on a boat different from the shore? If you paddle your boat, perhaps bring some of those hand/arm exercises...Just a suggestion.  My opinion, along with everyone else, does not matter at the end of the day. The CO is who you will be convincing and I don't think you have anything accepted in the sport fishing world to back you up!  Good luck!"
458521,Roy,2010-04-21 19:33:00,13728,"Scuro IMO, you're trolling now and it isn't for carp. You aren't even sure the first one was a carp.This is a trolling thread by design."
458555,scuro2,2010-04-21 20:44:00,904,"Quick to judge, are you not?...and may I add your assumptions are way off base.  I took my yak out to Lake Erie and fished for pike a few weeks ago. That is legal. While moving between places I let a lure out. I could see carp jumping everywhere and got a number of hits. One had some good line peel to it but it got off. I'd see em jump and then go other to that spot and get a hit. These were probably carp because it was shallow and I wasn't near structure. I've been researching a little, and others on this thread confirm that carp at certain times will hit lures. Now pike are not in-season anywhere inshore in southwestern ontario. I don't want to drive over an hour to fish. I want to fish my local lake. So there is the possibility that I could catch pike. That is not my intention, nor would I be fishing lures or fishing in a style that I would to catch pike. How is this different then fishing a lake when pike is open and there is the possibility that you catch off season bass?  I want to fish this way because I don't like sitting on my arse when I fish and I can yak and see some countryside all the while testing out my theory. I enjoy the mental challenge of ""putting it together"" and catching fish when others are not.  I think I can catch em. Maybe not as effectively as with corn but I got hits previously every 20 minutes or so and that ain't bad fishing to me. Also I can cover a lot of ground and find hot spots."
458557,EC1,2010-04-21 20:52:00,930,"If you want to try something like that, I guess I'd wait for something else that opens in which you could troll for. It's similar to trying to get pike/muskie with a senko...Sure, they will hit....But trying that on a Kawartha lake after the first week of June, and I will for sure think you are trying to get some OOS bass.  I've had a number of times where carp had taken a huge hit onto rapalas and other cranks, so I know it can be a truth."
458563,Roy,2010-04-21 21:04:00,13728,"No worries Scuro.... go troll for carp in your nutrient rich ""runoff pool"" then. Just don't troll for them here."
458565,scuro2,2010-04-21 21:09:00,904,"Like I said there the waters are overrun with carp. It is almost dead water because of all of the nutrients coming off the farm land. You see fish kills of bullheads because the ecosystem sucks. I've spent many a night casting from shore trying to get pike and nada. Carp, you can't put corn out and not get a hit in 15 minutes.  My point is I've research this, believe that if I fish in a certain way I will almost exclusively, if not totally catch carp on this lake, and I'd like to try that out. Where are all the libertarians when you need them?"
458566,Roy,2010-04-21 21:12:00,13728,"Like I said, knock yourself out."
458567,aplumma,2010-04-21 21:14:00,6896,Why risk the ticket? Wait till the other OOS are legal and go from their. I can catch Big Blue Catfish trolling jig and fillets but with Striper bass OOS I dead bait on the bottom till the season for Stripers is open.  P.S. SCURO2 While you think Roy is quick to judge remember he is a Moderator and has access to ALL of your information/posts/internal notes and I am sure he has his bases for warning you in a polite way.

458569,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-21 21:20:00,10439,"Try trolling a small black leach (fly) either on a fly setup or spinning with some split shot. There is a really good spot and stalk fishery for carp on the fly in I believe either Erie or Michigan, so if you cna cast to them Ièm sure they would take a slow trolled leach."
458573,Afraz,2010-04-21 21:37:00,250,"I caught a 15 lber on the trent chucking out a massive lucky strike in red and white, andthis thing was hooked on the lip like it took the lure in. So who knows, but like everyone else said trolling shouldn't be something you should risk trying for carp, what you can do is flyfish using large corn kernels if casting and top water is ur thing.  Corn isn't slimy or dirty, so you should be alrite with that. Maybe even corn imitations would work so long as they have scent."
458575,scuro2,2010-04-21 21:44:00,904,"Anyone who knows me, knows I am always above board, and you would see that on all my pms or posts. I'm a school teacher and not your average rule breaker.

458598,hendrix,2010-04-21 23:08:00,61,"carp hit lures, I have never tried catching them off a boat though"
458612,4thgen,2010-04-21 23:44:00,157,"Firstly, I imagine that you will take some heat as it will look like you are targeting OOS fish.  One thing that I can't get past is that you're saying that you've had alot of hits on lures? I find that when carp are hooked in the mouth they have a really hard time getting off. In fact, I can't remember the last time that I lost a carp and still had a hook when I reeled in. On the other hand, when carp are foul hooked they often get off rather easily. You don't always end up with scales on your hook either.  So my question is: what reason do you really have to believe that they are biting? When you see a group of spawning carp and then you drag a lure through them, chances are you are going to get bumps that might look like hits. As others have said, if you want to catch carp, bait is the way to go. I have had success with corn many times and it isn't sticky/smelly etc. Flies work well too, but I usually cast them as opposed to trolling with them. Or... you can troll around lures, but I imagine that you'll find you will be foul hooking many carp before you get one to bite."
458615,Paully,2010-04-21 23:54:00,712,"  Yea... and last week i was catching crappie on scugog trolling a muskie killer, and the CO came by and didn't have a problem with it!"
458650,splashhopper,2010-04-22 02:15:00,2931,"  I am just wondering why your profile pic looks like a pike...?  It sure leaves some questions about the intent of your ""trolling for carp"""
458658,scuro2,2010-04-22 02:39:00,904,"Perhaps and that is a reason why I started this thread. Tell me though how many pike fishermen have caught smallmouth bass out of season? I will be fishing in a way, and with lures that no one normally would troll for or fish for pike.  Fishing from a kayak is different, you can't instantly get on your rod, in fact it could be seconds until you are in the proper position to fight a fish...but your point is well taken. I wouldn't know what the answer is until I tested this theory out. Have thought about tightening the drag down next time.  Do carp spawn first week of april? That is when I went out...those first few incredibly hot days. I have heard what others have said but I simply want to try a new method. If I'm foul hooking them, I'll know that soon enough. And if few the pike who live in these skank waters have enough energy after the spawn and the daily struggle to get oxygen, hit micro lures trolled at a very slow speed in the middle of a body of water, I'll know that too. Rest assured if either case is happening I'd stop.  I'd rather be in my kayak getting exercise and looking at the countryside fishing for carp then sitting on a cold rock contemplating the price of corn and waiting for the slightest twitch."
