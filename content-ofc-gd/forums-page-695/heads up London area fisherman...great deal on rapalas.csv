They also have a selection of storm lures including thundersticks and thunderstick jr. for 3.99 each along with a good selection of blue fox lures for 2.99 each. The rapalas at 6 buck is about 4 bucks cheaper than anywhere else. I just picked up about 15 rapalas and the selection was still good but hurry they will go fast."
