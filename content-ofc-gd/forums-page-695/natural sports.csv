456576,FISHINGNUT,2010-04-16 01:13:00,253,Rainbow (Chad) is amazing I dont go there for price but for the service and the willingness just to shoot the breeze about fishing. Fishing Fanatics in Waterloo also a great spot small but very friendly NaturalSports over priced and not willing to help out much unless as stated before your one of the chosen ones or are looking at a $400 rod and reel combo I have been put off by them one to many times I will not give them my money while there are others in town who deserve it more IMO
456623,Cookslav,2010-04-16 03:53:00,1457, Do they have any recent sales promo's? I might just need to drop in and have a look around....and up and down
456640,jace,2010-04-16 08:22:00,472,"  I go past it every day although I haven't been in since he moved to the bigger shop.   There's a sign outside about a sale and the trout opener.   I should have gone in there when he was moving and had that 40% sale to clear out stuff rather than move it but i slept through that too.  as far as the store by the beer store, I was in there for the first time in about a year and i saw a reel in there that was clearly used.  It was not priced so i asked how much and how old/used it is.  The guy said it wasn't used.     It has some telltale signs that it was used quite a bit, there were no scratches or damage but lots of other things that could only happen after being used for some time.  If you want know which reel it is, PM me, then go in and see for yourself."
456807,BillsTheBassMan,2010-04-16 19:25:00,932,"I've frequented both Natural Sports and Rainbow Sports for quite some time.  I have a pretty firm stand on which store is best - Rainbow is far superior and worth the drive from the opposite end of the city.  I get this weird feeling in Natural Sports that I just shouldn't be pulling out my wallet . . . ever.  The younger guys working there are really trying hard and they are eager to help.  Some of the ""more experienced"" staff seem to strike the fear of god into the younger guys whenever they're in the area and they just tense up and seem uneasy.  Small talk and customer service is at a minimum unless you are A)  professional  or   looking to spend lots of cash.  I'm also not that fond of the Grand River Bass Tournament that Natural Sports runs.  To me, it is a prime example of resources being exploited for money.  I'm like most other anglers.  I go to fishing stores to just ""browse"" on at least 50% of my trips.  On these trips I generally spend under $100.  (Today I went into Rainbow to ""browse"" and got a great deal on a new baitcaster rod - despite a full store, Chad went into the back and got his baitcaster setup and showed me some of the basics).  Regardless, these trips are more for enjoyment so the trips should actually be enjoyable.  Price points in stores like this are generally the same that customer service should be the defining factor of what store is better.  There have even been times at Rainbow where Chad has talked me out of buying something that may not be ideal for the specific fishing experience I want it for.  Chad will always do everything he can to make sure you get your warranties from the major fishing companies whenever you run into any problems.  I broke a St. Croix a few years back and he pretty much handled the entire thing - I soon had a new rod.  With honesty and service like that Rainbow has earned my business for as long as I stay in the area and beyond.  To sum it up - check out both stores - you'll probably see what I am seeing and decide on Rainbow.  I generally like to get an XL coffee from Tim's before I go because I'm generally there for an hour."
456860,nuke,2010-04-16 21:30:00,60,"I live in Waterloo and work in Cambridge.  I like both Natural and Rainbow, but find myself going to Tall Tales in Cambridge for live bait in the winter months (shiners).  Natural used to have minnows before they expanded, but I don't beleive they do noe (correct me if I'm wrong).  Once again, great service at all three places.  Mike"

456898,fshrgy99,2010-04-16 22:56:00,9,As far as prices at natural ...I just got back from BPS in vaughn where they are asking $799 for a HDS5 ...price at natural seen this a.m. ...$699 (and will not be undersold) Also trout selection is superior IMO at Natural.. As far as customer service  ...fishing fanatics hands down (next to the beer store at Hazel and Albert in Waterloo). Any question answered and always time to talk about recent activity. Definitely worth dropping in just to stay in touch and worth spending an extra buck for help. Rainbow? ....no thanks. Troutfitters ...for the fly fishing specialist and available at Natural if it's closer. my .02.
457097,fishdawg,2010-04-17 15:44:00,912,"Fishing Finactics, Tall Tales & Kingsway Sports are my faves when im up in the KW/Gulph area"
457098,Steve,2010-04-17 15:53:00,2075,"Natural Sports has the BEST (better the FW, better than BPS, better than JB's) G Loomis selection.  I bought the G Loomis FROG ROD at the fishing show from them for 65% of retail (by retail i mean what jb's and fw).  I dont know if Vince Castellano works there all the time, but he was the rep who i spoke with at their booth at the fishing show.  By far the best booth in the show."
458049,BillsTheBassMan,2010-04-20 02:34:00,932," I made my first stop by Fishing Fanatics this Sunday and I must say that it was a very positive experience.  Good selection, solid prices, but most importantly, GREAT customer service.  A good choice for sure along with Rainbow Sports."
458331,danbouck,2010-04-21 01:29:00,4380," Tall Tales, I refuse to go in there, the service is BRUTAL. I was once called a moron by him for going ice fishing in a blizzard."
458355,waterwolf,2010-04-21 02:33:00,556,"finally ,the voice of reason! i've NEVER,, EVER had a bad experience at bass pro! 50 or 60 visits and stll regard bps as the best thing to happen to the GTA with regards to the outdoors sports . crappy tire,, walmart, come on! fishing depo,rude ,, lebarons, arrogance. can't touch their sales,and for me the staff is usually very willing to make an effort. never been to rainbow or natural, never had the need. just  tired of the tread on BassPro."
458669,Cookslav,2010-04-22 03:28:00,1457," Sorry but some times its well deserved...  I Drove from Kitchener to Buy Hunting boots, a Wet Sack, and a Survival suit. $1000+ purchase lined up... I researched the products called to ensure they were carrying the very same items listed in the catelog....I did all the things a responsible consumer should.  When I got there, they didn't have the boots, the next brand up was $80 more, they didn't have ANY wet sacks, and they didn't have the 2 peice mustang survival suits in stock either...even though I had called to check the night before.  When I asked the staff if they could check the store room as I was told they had these items in stock the night before they responded    ""sorry we're in the middle of inventory go ask the customer service desk. they should have time to check"" When I begrudgingly did just that the Desk said "" We don't have a storage room, what is on the shelf is all we have."" I of course asked to speak to a manager as I had just driven and hour and a half to buy 3 items I was assured were in stock which were not, and was given the run around by the floor staff.... When I spoke to the manager he offered a rain check...which I said would be great if they could ship me the product, or discount the price to reimburse me for my gas being this would now require a second trip from Kitchener. I was told that is not possible. I left, VERY pissed off and wrote nice letter to the GM..........2 years ago with no response.  So ya....Screw Bass pro  I'm not treading on them for fun, or cause its fashionable. I have good reason to tread on them."
458673,fish_d00d,2010-04-22 03:53:00,38," Hazel & Albert, I believe. When I was there years ago, the store had just opened, and didn't appear to have too much stuff. Perhaps they've expanded their inventory since.  If you haven't yet, stop by The Grill at University Plaza ... Great burgers ..."
456121,Drock6687,2010-04-15 00:40:00,90,"Hey everyone, just wondering if anyone here has had any expeirence with natural sports in kitchener?  How are their prices?  I love going to bass pro but its a bit of a hike so if these guys have good prices I may look into it...thanks for the help!"
456122,danbouck,2010-04-15 00:41:00,4380,It's a great store and they have good prices.
456142,bridge,2010-04-15 01:13:00,54,I personally like it much better now then a couple of years ago.  Are Bass pros prices really that good??  Check the store out after all looking at fishing stuff is cool.
456155,timmeh,2010-04-15 01:35:00,609,If you're in the KW area check out Rainbow sports as well.  They don't have the selection of bass pro but the service is MUCH better. If price is your thing both Rainbow and Natural have decent prices.
456156,bow slayer,2010-04-15 01:36:00,1074,"good store, good selection fair prices. Also not sure where you are but Angling Outfitters in Woodstock is a great store with good prices."
456158,jediangler,2010-04-15 01:40:00,1923,I live in Kitchener and would rather travel to BassPro once or twice a year than get hosed at either Rainbow or Natural Sports. Don't drive too far or you'll be disappointed.
456182,Drock6687,2010-04-15 02:19:00,90, Where is rainbow sports?
456188,Musky or Specks,2010-04-15 02:33:00,2710,king st and northland ave waterloo
456194,rock34,2010-04-15 02:50:00,215,"I buy 90% of my fishing gear at Rainbow sports.  The owner Chad is awesome.  I wanted to buy a new pair of Dan Bailey waders and I told him the price I could get in the USA if I had them shipped in and he matched it, which was like a $100 discount.  He always takes care of his customers.  Natural has a much larger selection but there prices are no better and their customer service is very weak.  If you arent a pro then they dont seem to have time for you.  Anyone with a dumb question will be made to feel like it was a dumb question.  Just my 2 cents"
456197,timmeh,2010-04-15 02:58:00,609," I agree with you on this. I usually only talk to the younger guys when I'm in there, they're easier to talk to for sure.   Also Drock - As M&S mention Rainbow is at the corner of King and Northland in Waterloo. It's just north of the Home Depot on King St."
456253,Musky or Specks,2010-04-15 11:16:00,2710,Also Rainbow is the only store I know of with a young hottie who actually knows her stuff
456265,dobee,2010-04-15 11:51:00,301,natural is way overpriced!
456295,Mike Pike,2010-04-15 13:29:00,1332,"I like going to Natural Sports.  Nelson, the owner, keeps the store stocked pretty good and the selection of specific stuff I'm looking for is excellent.  Since I work in Waterloo, I visit Chad's place, too, at Rainbow Sports.  He's recently renovated( moved to the next unit over )and now has more space and stock.  Personally, I don't think you'd be disappointed with either store."
456325,Uncle Buck,2010-04-15 14:19:00,1000," so in essence his price was $100 more then market value???  also goes to show you markup... doubt he'd take a loss...  I understand about buying power, sadly loyalty these days means nothing... but bottom line is $$  i wish my customers had loyalty"
456327,tightline,2010-04-15 14:23:00,322, Yes she is and Yes she does!!!
456328,tightline,2010-04-15 14:26:00,322,"For the record there are 2 more in Kitchener/Waterloo...One on old king down by the fry wagon on the way to the grand on the left hand side.  The other is in the plaza where the beer store is (don't ask how I know that) on Albert I believe or in that area, he's pretty new and a nice chap at that"
456353,ryansusanna,2010-04-15 15:41:00,27,"I buy 90% of my gear from Rainbow Sports as well. Reasons why...  1. Almost always better prices than Bass Pro (with the rare exception where BPS blows something out the door) 2. Doesn't require a day trip to go to the tackle shop 3. If i need something they do not have, Chad will order it in without requiring silly minimum order quantities. 4. If you buy any electronics and/or boat accessories he also provides an installation service which is second to none!!!"
456365,troutologist,2010-04-15 15:58:00,951,  I wish this was happening when I lived there.  Chad got all my business when I lived there.. Customer service 2nd to none.
456377,rock34,2010-04-15 16:17:00,215," His price was in line with every other Canadian distributors.  I found a sale on-line that was out of the US and calculated with duty how much I could get the waders to my door for.  I told him to come within reason of the price and I would buy from him and he matched it.  Trust me, service is amazing there and if you dont like the price them tell him why not.  His strategy to success is clearly building customer loyalty and repeat business not huge margins."
456378,MJL,2010-04-15 16:29:00,2427,Never been to the actual store in Kitchener but the customer service that Natural Sports gave me at all the Fishing Shows and Sportsmen Shows I’ve been to over the years has been amazing…Top notch IMO.   I’ve never been to Rainbow Sports but that’s a great incentive…”So you like fishing too?...”
456401,Cookslav,2010-04-15 17:32:00,1457,"Natural works for me just fine. I don't find the prices out of whack at all? But even if they are a bit high its still usually cheaper when I factor in the Gas to Bass pro. Plus I don't lose 2 hours of my time driving there and back, and they are usually the closest (decent) store for me. Though I have to admitt I have expereinced the ""Non Pro"" treatment at Natural in the past. ""Sometimes""...""Some"" of their staff seem to be a bit put off with small talk. I always make it a point to get to know the guys in these shops no matter where in the province they are located, because I'm a freindly guy, and they are also of course hot beds for tips, and upto date conditions etc... Most of these guys live and breath fishing, and gladly chat up info, and I'm the first to chat about conditions and such as well. Some staff on the other hand only chat with local pros, and top ranking customers...which I am not. I'll say this though, I've NEVER had an issue with customer service when it comes to info on equipment, but yes....some staff shut it down when you chat about anything outside of the equipment. I wouldn't really call that poor service, I just wouldn't call it ""exceptional"" service either?  As for BPS... I've not had any good customer service experiences at Bass pro that would undo the last unpleasent experience I had with their customer sales department/manager....so I vowed to never shop there again, and its been 2 years. When I get an appology letter, I ""might"" think about it.  Rainbow sports however is also great. It unfortunatly out of my way ususally, and I wouldn't rank them any higher on the scale then Natural so I Guess I just haven't been there in a while, but I have nothing bad to say about them either. This thread has me thinking its time to shop there again next time just to see how they are doing. Cheers,"
456504,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-15 21:59:00,2690,"Haven't been lately, but, found them overpriced on my last visit.  Used to frequent it quite a bit, 10 years or more ago, still haven't found a better place than Angling Outfitters right here in Woodstock (and no Jos didn't pay me for the plug, LOL)  Good prices, care about their customers and willing to spend time with you.  I also give a thumbs up to Jimmy down at Long Point, great guy, and Rotten Ronnies seemed reasonable enough in prices for what I purchased there."
456507,Musky or Specks,2010-04-15 22:05:00,2710,"Sure, I think my last post has piqued your curiousity"
456518,fishing n autograph,2010-04-15 22:26:00,2540,"Natural sports is a fantasic place....reasonable prices and they are flexable. They do help you out when they can. They have great selection and are quite knowledgeable. They may not have the selection that bass pro has, but it's a much better customer service experience"
456565,ironstone74,2010-04-16 00:31:00,201,"I live right around the corner from Natural and I'm in there every couple of weeks.  Selection is really good, pricing is OK to high, service depends on who you talk to.  Some of the young guys are great; friendly and knowledgeable.  The older guys, Nelson excluded, are quite honestly terrible in terms of friendliness and willingness to talk fishing to teh average customer.  I'm glad I'm not the only one that gets brutal service from some of the guys there, I was starting to think it was me  .  I like rainbow Sports but their prices, IMO, are not the best.  I bought my first Senkos there, 10 pack of 5""ers and they were $9.99.  Nasty.  She is cute though!!!"
