I have a 12 volt trolling motor and 2 deep cycle batteries, because 1 usually doesn't last the whole day.  I would like to hook the two batteries up in parallel esentially making one big battery because I am sick of changing them over on the lake, so will a 2 bank charger work if one bank is on each battery, or is that like charging one battery with 2 banks because they are in parallel?  Will this work or how do I get around this? I was thinking about just using one bank on both but that would probably take a long time to charge them both, sometimes not being ready to go for the next morning I'm guessing.  thx"
458932,Terry,2010-04-23 08:59:00,14456,"yeah just hook up the one bank to charge them, unless you disconnect the batteries before you charge them"

458948,John Bacon,2010-04-23 11:36:00,3277,"You could rig a switch into the wires that connect the batteries in parallel.  Flick the switch to the off position when you are charging; the batteries would not be connected to each other with the switch in the off position, so using both banks should be okay.  I am not sure what would happen if you forgot to switch the connection off and left the batteries connected in parallel while they were both connected to the charge."
458960,dada2727,2010-04-23 12:46:00,108,how long do you think it would take a 10amp charger to charge both batteries from dead if they were hooked up in parallel?
458967,hirk,2010-04-23 13:18:00,571,They would draw 5amps ea.Your batteries would seldom be much under 50% charge so if they are m-27's (120amp)@ 50% discharge it would take 12hrs to full charge.
