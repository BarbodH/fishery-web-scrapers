458937,Twocoda,2010-04-23 10:21:00,4130,"NEWSFLASH :  Due to unseasonal temps and lack of rain the Ontario Fish Census Report has determined that there is no sport in targeting trout in 3 inches of water and has released a statement that trout opener will be canceled on the 24th of April in all Ontario tribs and rivers until the rivers water levels have risen to a respectable depth /flow to make it more sporting. There is an exception to this statement that if fisherpersons carry garbage bags and clean 6 pieces of debris each along the shorelines of thier perspective streams they will be permitted to fish and enjoy the tradition of trout opener to its fullest!  Tight lines everyone !!! have a safe adventure and clean up after yourselves...so as not to ruin future opportunities on the rivers...  Ill leave you with this little ""catch phrase""(pun intended)...""if its black .....put it back"""

458974,torco,2010-04-23 13:37:00,656,"Hahaha. But seriously a good message, if everyone can pick up some trash this weekend it will truly help our streams.  As for me I'm heading to the Durham region to fish way upstream for browns, specks and maybe the odd rainbow on the fly rod.  Hope everyone has a great opener.  One final word.  RESPECT.  It goes a long way."
