458247,Sinker,2010-04-20 21:18:00,8692," SF, I'm not saying duck hunters have more rights, we don't. I'm just saying its common courtesy to give  us some space if your fishing. I thought you would understand that, and after reading this, I'm sure you do. I'd take ya out for some birds anytime.  Now, after reading your story, I realize you've had a dealing with a couple freakin idiots, and I would have reported them too. I've had run ins with some real tools  in my time on the water as well. I just keep on movin on. Its not because they have more rights, just for my own safety.  No hard feelings dude. I was just a little shocked that you were that close to duck hunters while fishing, and then complained about them shooting. I misunderstood I guess.  This post is getting off topic. Its not about race, colour or creed. If I saw a bunch of locals keeping over their limit, I'd report them too. Why is it that when poachers are mentioned, the race card gets played. Play by the freakin' rules and there are no problems. I see plenty of asians, germans, polish, ukrain, italian, even canadians.....etc. playing by the rules all the time. I'm not picking on any one race, just POACHERS!!!  S."
458252,Terry,2010-04-20 21:24:00,14456,sadly enough I see all makes and colors not obeying the law...we need an non race solution to the problem..  but as for hunters and fishermen..whoever was in the area first has the right to the spot..........

458267,Big Cliff,2010-04-20 22:12:00,6899," That is exactly the kind of post that does absoutly nothing but create trouble and stir the pot to no end! I would like to invite you to come and spend a day on the water with me. We'll do the rounds and I will guarantee you, no, I'll bet you a free weekend stay at my place that by the end of the day you will see just as many non Asians poaching as you will see any particular race. You loose, you apologize publically on this board!"
458275,misfish,2010-04-20 22:40:00,29133,"Cliff,you have been very professional throughout this whole thread.  I have read and reread this post numorous times. At work and home. Have typed my opinion numerous times,then deleted.It,s a real hard topic to comment on without being bashed or misunderstood.   Your on the right track IMO.  If I may,as for the duck hunters thing,we have the same problem here.We set up,and along comes the angler.I just step out,and explain we are hunting waterfowl and they have no isues with it.They move along.  Get along people."
458289,cram,2010-04-20 23:24:00,1733," Cliff - I said the asian-kawarthas ""situation"".  You can say what you want, but you guys have a situation there.  The ""situation"" includes poaching (and lots of it), but it also includes a mess load of racism.    I had never heard of ""nipper tipping"" until i went fishing there.  I also wasn't *that* surprised when hearing about the poor kid that was paralyzed in that accident last year.  The racism in that area is racism, because of the actions of a (very small) few people.  Quite frankly, i told my chinese buddy (who is NOT a poacher) to NOT go out in the boat by himself when at the cottage with us. It seems a little unsafe there if you're a chinese guy.  Its the fault of the ministry/COs for not putting their foots down on the select few poachers who are creating the reputation, and the police for not squashing the local vigilantes who step over the line.  And, to be clear - i am not calling you a vigilante. I'm referring to the idiots tipping boats, pushign people off piers, and running people down in their cars."

458307,Twocoda,2010-04-21 00:25:00,4130,Most of the time i find lack of knowledge is  the base for poaching just last weekend i was heading to a legal spot on the river and noticed a person clearly fishing in a sanctuary in the middle of the river....i called out to him to ask how the fishing was ( this provided the opportunity to see his face and see if he was a native) and if he understood he was fishing in a closed section of the river ....his lights came on and he high tailed it out of the river...when he got to shore i reminded him it was wise to do your homework on any given body of water prior to casting a line so you know where and when you can fish...he was a nice guy ...just made a mistake...thats all it was...i took him down river and put him front of fish ...and he had a good day...  Every encounter doesnt have to be confrontation when its approached from the angle of trying to help or save someone some hardships of fines...i think 9 times outta 10 youll find you may just get a big thank you from most people for saving them from themselves...  in the same note...some just cant be saved  i was taught it was illegal to shoot a bird not in flight...maybe the rules have changed...
458326,AzuluSpookd,2010-04-21 01:15:00,348,"Lack of Knowledge isn't an excuse. Every angler and hunter has a responsibility to make sure that they know the regulations. Period.  ...and I highly doubt 9 times out of 10 that is the case, regardless.  I would suggest that 9 times out of 10 that those people (poachers) use that as their excuse, because people tend to want to believe it. "
458381,mbac31,2010-04-21 04:43:00,904,No harm here. Still have love for ya bud. LMAO. Wasnt directing it at you just a couple of PM's zI got about having something against Duck Hunters which was not what it was about. I love hunting and have killed my share of animals as it is a fun passtime like fishing  and a right to do so. My beef is with the authorities that complain that they dont get the publics help yet when we do they turn the other way.
458542,blarg,2010-04-21 20:26:00,289,"I have no experience with this issue, but I thought this quote from Ujal Dosanj, liberal member of parliment might have some pertinence,  “I think what we are doing to this country is that this idea of multiculturalism has been completely distorted, turned on its head to essentially claim that anything anyone believes – no matter how ridiculous and outrageous it might be – is okay and acceptable in the name of diversity.  “Where we have gone wrong in this pursuit of multiculturalism is that there is no adherence to core values, the core Canadian values, which [are]: That you don’t threaten people who differ with you; you don’t go attack them personally; you don’t terrorize the populace.”  ...“I think Canadians need to engage in this cultural diversity debate,” he said. “And we actually have to say to each other: ‘Hey what you’re doing is wrong. What you’re doing here is right.’ We should stop being politically correct and have a debate.”  I want everyone to play by the same rules, putting our heads in the sand and pretending that some groups aren't different then others in their traditional practices and views ins't going to achieve that. Those who enforce our laws are no doubt as sensitive to being called a racist as we are.  I know there are a ton of white people that are probably doing more damage than all of the non white poachers, but that doesn't mean the non white poachers should be ignored simply because we don't want to go down that road, and from everything i have seen, that does happen.  Thats probably trhe last and only time I will agree with a liberal mp."

I guess I probably think that not all people that follow a line of thought like the one proposed would be as level headed as you. What do you do when you politely tell someone what they are doing is wrong and they tell you to screw your hat? How long does it take before things escalate? I go back to the thread that I brought up and would bet that the boat bully was sure he was doing the right thing. I fully support your idea of calling the MNR as many times as required. Jim"
457960,DRIFTER_016,2010-04-19 22:50:00,10439,"  Pretty simple answer here. When it has happened that I was told to mind my own business I just say fine and dial the cell phone, then I let the athorities take care of the problem for me. Works every time.  I remember one fall fishing the mouth of the Ganny and a fellow caught a laker and was keeping it. I told him they were out of seaon and he ignored me, called the local cops and they took care of the problem within ten minutes."
458004,toca,2010-04-20 00:49:00,274," I Agree With Drifter On This One, Just Better To Let The Other Fisher-Person Know what he doing wrong first then Call The Authorities/Conservation Officers. Another Thing What I Liked About What Aile_Goby Told Me Was To Take A Video Or Picture Of The Person and Show It To The Authorities. Hear Lots Of Stories About Confrontation Becoming Fist Fights.  Although I Almost Threw A Friend Of Mine Off The Dock When I Was In Huntsville For Wanted Keeping A Baby Pike. Eventually He Threw It Back But Caught 3 Footer An Hour Later.

458013,mbac31,2010-04-20 01:07:00,904,"The O.P.P for results are a joke. Sorry for that reply but they are. I had 2 Duck Hunters on Balsam shoot over my boat, kill ducks and geese on the water while not in flight and kept it up all day until about 10 yards away from me they almost hit us. They shot at least 30 birds on the water while they were swimming around all day. Our local un-informed OPP officer had to be called three times during the morning before they showed up and basically did nothing "" Joked about the Bass guy going up against the Hunter""  complete and utter idiots. I was told to go to the other areas that I knew.  I have a video and tons of pictures of them from that day but what to do with it. Nothing, I am slowly losing respect for out CO's and Police. They have the means but just dont give a crap about it. I have had 4 instances in the past with CO's and OPP officers.  Saw a Durham Region police officer Parked at Town docks on Sunday last and right in front of him. 3 guys went down the dock in a little tinny, no life jackets and nothing else either. He clearly saw this and did nothing. Jokes, and they wonder why we are losing respect for these organizations. Paycheque collectors now and thats it.  My 2 cents."

458026,mbac31,2010-04-20 01:24:00,904,I thought so. When a freekin stray shot of pellet hits the dam trolling motor you ould think they would do something. I even have the officers name but sorry he was a joke.
458041,mjack 7,2010-04-20 02:04:00,22,Im both a duck hunter and a fisherman.  When duck seasons is open its always a good thing to fish where there isn't alot of shooting going on.   Unless you want to get rained one with pellets.  Shot goes along way.
458076,Sinker,2010-04-20 04:59:00,8692," freakin right its my business!! I did call, and warned them what I was doing. They continued to fill the coolers.    In fact, that is exactly what I did. I even offered to take them out in my boat to take a look. Nobody showed up.   Smalliefisher,  I'm surprised with your comments about the duck hunters. I honestly am.  If I was you I would have got the hell out of there. Actually, I would NEVER have gotten that close to start with. You obviously knew they were hunting. I hate it when guys come fish within range of my 12 guage.........I will never understand that. I didn't get up at dark thirty, set up 10 dozen deocoys in the dark, and wait for sunrise to come, only to have a bass boat sit in front of my set up. I would have told you to move along if it was me hunting.........nicely of course. I think its common courtesy, isn't it?  Would you have a picnic in the woods, under a guys treestand........while he's hunting out of it? Same scenario. Give us duck hunters a little space. We've already spent a couple hours setting up in the dark before you've even had your morning coffee. There is a lot of room on a lake to fish, and its a lot easier for you to move along than me with a pile of decoys to pull in first.  BTW, There is no regulations about killing birds on the water, its totally legal.  S."
458081,mbac31,2010-04-20 09:33:00,904," Sorry Sinker, but when I'm there first as I started fishing at 2:30 am like I normally do and it seems a few birds ended up swimming around the shoreline when the sun came up. I was there first. There were no decoys there at all until noon. The decoys were very few I beleive 5 and were about 2 feet off shore and were placed there after they had shot. .  I was fishing around a 500 yard range area all night and all day. So what you are stating is that I should move myself because someone comes in there with a shot gun because he has more rights, sorry my friend but not happening. This jack Ass had no decoys until 12:30 and came there around 9am when he could clearly see me and another boat right in front. I could tell what he was smoking almost. , clearly wanted to bully someone out of an area because there dumbass selfs could not get any birds any where else. No need to try and do what they did. I was going up the shoreline following the weedline while there were 5 more boats in that bay. I did not even see any decoys in front of me just a few geese swimming along the shoreline in front of me, when all of a sudden these asses shot right in front, no need for that.  Thats a stupid comment that was made as I'm a hunter as well. I respect it at all times. I have nothing against hunters as I have pretty much shot every species here in Ontario and other Provinces. But I will in no way nor hell put up with guys doing what they did. I have pictures I these guys laughing when they shot in our direction first and of them drinking beer. It was only when I went ashore and  physically took licence plates as they were parked on the side of the road and boat licence as the so called cops did not do so. Remember this my friend that this is a Public freekin boat launch where these guys wer shooting across. I have went into many bays before and left once I notice anyone back there hunting, and I have done this hundreds of times. I think the question needs to be turned b ack around as Im surprised you made those comments.  BTW , sorry for not realizing that birds are allowed to be shot while not in flight. I understood differently. I also hunt . I will shoot in flight only not while they are on the water. Just me I guess.  Thats my 2 cents"
458094,fish_fishburn,2010-04-20 12:30:00,1311,"I always thought it was illegal to shoot birds while there on the water. I remember my dad telling me this when I was a newby at 14 yrs old. I only shoot them in flight. Seems very unsportsman like to shoot them when there swimming. After all, how easy is that?"
458137,fish_d00d,2010-04-20 15:36:00,38," Agreed. In this thread there have been some remarks about ethnicity and race that are be unwarranted. The word ""immigrant"" has also been abused - please remember that at some point, unless you are of native descent, all our ancestors were immigrants to this country, and they all faced challenges, such as language, new rules, policies, etc...  As some have mentioned on this thread, simply calling and reporting is the best option for all parties. Escalation is everyone's responsibility, however, taking action, beyond a call to an authoritative figure, is only the duty of the MNR/police. No person without the proper authority should take action beyond a phone call - a simple rule that will avoid fist/fish-fights, law-suits, and high blood pressure.  In contrast to what some may claim, I have seen fishermen of ALL races abuse our system. Regardless of their background, these offenders should be reported, and the proper authorities should take action. That is the rule.  I am of Chinese descent and I respect the laws we have set here in Ontario, including those associated with fishing. The last thing I want to see materializing from this thread is racial profiling and further prejudice when I fish legally, which leads to further undeserved harassment whenever I am trying to enjoy this hell of a great past-time.  The following should apply to all fishing enthusiasts of ALL races - if he/she is observed to obviously be fishing outside of regulations, then by all means report the offence. Otherwise, it really is not anyone's call (other than the authorities') to walk over to someone and interrogate him/her; unless the intent is to initiate a friendly chat."
458138,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-20 15:47:00,0,"I find it funny that not even mentioning ""WHO"" we are talking about that everybody knows ""who"" we all are referring to.  Wonder why that is?"
458141,bigfish1965,2010-04-20 15:58:00,3382, Because we notice differences before we notice similarities. It is human nature. Those moments we remember more than others. We tend to remember bad things by people who are different than us more because we want to believe that people like us are generally 'good folk'. Psychology 101 and the root of racism. Fortunately we are intelligent enough to recognize the inherent bias in us all and not let it cloud our judgment.
458150,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-20 16:11:00,0," 101 Easy to say that Rick but when ever I see blatant poaching it is by the ones we all are talking about here. I'm not a racist. I have friends of all color. It just so happens that they would agree with most of what's been said so far. Actually, I had a good friend in the boat with me the other day and he was interpreting what was being said.... He could only understand four of the five different languages."
458163,bigfish1965,2010-04-20 16:46:00,3382," Perhaps when you see certain people fishing, you expect a certain outcome. Each time you see that outcome it confirms the bias. When you see others fishing, you do not look for the activity and therefore do not see it. Do you not recall the big poaching threads here over the past...guy with eight lines in the water, group of kids snagging salmon at the dam, etc. All those poachers were Caucasian anglers...but we tend to forget that, because they are like us. I know when I look at the conviction reports, no group is over or under represented. When you consider the demographics of the country and especially regions within the country, everyone is just as likely or as unlikely to be a poacher. Certainly some groups are more likely to harvest fish..such as Americans according to past threads here. Since they are more likely to harvest do they not have a greater opportunity to poach...whether intentional or not? Or is it that we can't tell an American from a Canadian just by looking at them.  In any event, the purpose of this thread is about poaching and not racial profiling or notations. The race of a poacher is irrelevant and all should be prosecuted."
458174,fish_d00d,2010-04-20 17:03:00,38,"Consider this:  You just bought a new Honda to drive. Now you notice all the other Honda's on the road.  Rick, I completely respect your opinion on this. It seems to me that this topic may be snowballing into having certain minorities pointed out as scapegoats.  As Rick said, ""the purpose of this thread is about poaching and not racial profiling or notations. The race of a poacher is irrelevant and all should be prosecuted."""

458215,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-20 18:41:00,0,"Perhaps, eh Rick. I'm not saying that I have never seen a Caucasian poaching. I've just seen more of the non Caucasian when it comes to crappy and pan fishing. You know it as I know it as they know it. Its the sad truth. Who's using who as a scapegoat? Poachers are poachers. Just so happens I've seen more from the non Caucasian type. Maybe its just me but I doubt that very much. Ill agree that others poach and seeing as there are more Caucasian. That would mean there are more Caucasian poachers in your thinking. I'll agree with that as a statement. It still doesn't help with what I and a ton of other fishermen see on a daily basis with all species of fish."
458225,cityfisher,2010-04-20 19:23:00,959," Exactly... happend to me before, setup 30 decoys to have some morons setup infront of me... the shooting starte they left..... Why would fisherman setup infront of hunters? makes no sense..."

457245,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-04-18 00:03:00,0,"Poaching is a criminal offense. If the MNR are too busy, they should call the OPP/cops. At this rate our fishery will be destroyed in no time. All I hear are people calling the MNR and nobody showing up! Crappie and Salmon are one thing, but bass and pickeral is another. Considering all the poaching I've been hearing and seeing, the MNR could easily fund themselves catching all these poachers."

I've become very frustrated by some of the things I've seen and would like to do something about it. I'd certainly be willing to give some time to assist if a program existed. Other than continuing to make the phone calls is there anything else us responsible anglers can do?  And I'm not just directing this at Rick, but anyone who has any ideas, lets hear them."
457342,bigugli,2010-04-18 03:33:00,6138,"First, the management admin of  the MNR have to be convinced of the value and viability, but more importantly, one has to convince the politicians to cough up adequate coin and commitment for such a program. To be honest, the folks at Queeen's Park can't see beyond the next election, let alone throw together planning for a future one to two decades from now. That goes for Mcguinty and Hudak"

There will be no confrontation, we will simply observe,doccument, and report. We won't stop poaching in this area but we can sure make it more difficult to get away with.

I've often thought of getting some bumper stickers made up in bright Orange or Pink that say ""POACHER"" on them for the guys who fish Mountsberg illegally. Of course 2 wrongs don't make a right and I wouldn't be able to restrain myself in a confrontation. As for the racial profiling, it makes me very sad. I always make a point of saying hello or at least smile and wave when coming across visible minorities fishing. I can tell by the looks on their faces when they see me coming that they are expecting something quite the opposite and that isn't what this country is about."

Calling the cops is a tough one when said people are in a boat. I'd offer to take the cops out for a boat ride, but I don't think they'd be allowed to accept it.

But yea a couple years back i recall hearing about 2 azn fellas from Scarborough who ended up catching carp and tried to sell em to Soon-Lee on markham and lawrence.  I think it endedup with jail sentence and a hefty fine, not too sure about the details."
457507,timmeh,2010-04-18 18:18:00,609," Good for you, I would lend a few hours, but I'm not in the area. But on a side note I have heard there is a group that keeps an eye on the Grand River and some of the tribs in the area. Can anyone confirm or deny this?"
457516,skeeter,2010-04-18 18:41:00,1907,"I don't care if your white, yellow or blue---  if he is still white then you havent done your job right. if he is yellow, keep at him until there is some brown starting to seep out. if he is blue , then now your doing it right. just hold him under a bit longer!!!!!! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  ~~~~~~~~~~"
457520,JohnF,2010-04-18 18:45:00,3494," Your way is probably the only way it will ever work - small groups of responsible adults (adults both chronologically and emotionally) observing and reporting violations. I doubt the gov't is prepared to run the risk of formally authorizing untrained and unequipped volunteers to do the enforcement work. The risks for the gov't and the individuals are too high. But as long as you don't run afoul of any laws yourselves and stay safe then they might just appreciate the effort.  The problem is the hothead vigilante types who can't stop at simple observation and reporting. They decide that when the LEO's don't respond to their satisfaction they should then also administer the judgment and punishment (all for a good cause, mind you) themselves. But then they start liking that part too well. The next thing you know the law enforcement people are having to deal with the folks who set out to back them up.  I can see a small group of folks like you accomplishing something worthwhile and only hope that you don't get caught up in some kind of backlash from the lawbreakers. That's not unheard of and you guys won't have the flakjackets or the laws to use to protect yourselves.  I sincerely hope you can make even a small mark with your efforts and stay safe in the process. It may set an example for the rest of us to start doing a little more, like just getting some pictures of the the miscreants and their vehicles and turning them in. Eventually the word will get around and the poacher types will get a little less cocky and open about their activities when they can never be sure if they're being recorded and reported.  JF"

457526,skeeter,2010-04-18 18:58:00,1907,"Terry , i like your thinking.... how good would it be if they were standing in a bit of water? "
457591,vinnimon,2010-04-18 22:56:00,2593,"Try calling grand river trout fitter in fergus, the rod & gun club by caledonia on hwy 54, or even apps mill in burford area.Someone will know, Ive heard of it as well esp in the whitemans creek area and elora area."
457614,Squid,2010-04-18 23:54:00,1656,The squeaky wheel get the grease!! keep calling and they will come!!
457664,Radnine,2010-04-19 01:24:00,1538,"Wasn't there a report on here a while back from a fellow that actually had a guy come up to him on a lake and put his hand on his boat and intimidate him regarding his fishing? If I recall he was an OFC member of Asian decent and everyone took up for him on how wrong it was etc, etc. I mean how far removed is that from what you are talking about Cliff? 'Cause you can't have one (groups of do gooders watching everyone like a hawk)without the other (vigilante know it alls that hold their level of what's right higher than others). If there is a number call it; If you have influence over those that you inspire and teach, use it. But forming groups to police the waters? Sorry, you've lost me. Jim"
457734,Big Cliff,2010-04-19 07:39:00,6899," Man you sure don't know me very well do you? If you did, you wouldn't even suggest that my motives might have anything to do with race. As far as being a vigilanty?  If I see you stealing stuff from my back yard or my neighbours place would you expect me to not call the cops? These poachers are stealing plain and simple and I am tired of it. I have no intention of trying to enforce the laws, simply observe, doccument, and report so if you are poaching in my neck of the woods and I see you, expect to get reported."
457748,pikehunter,2010-04-19 11:08:00,1659,Good job Cliff   I'm happy to hear they were nabbed.  YES IT IS your business! As well as mine and everyone else. Just like the day I gave a dude crap for not washing his hands after coming out from a stall in a public toilet one day. Told me it was none of my business! Told him it is my business because I or someone will have to put their hands on the same grocery cart that he just had his crap covered paws all over after he leaves the store.
457753,Jer,2010-04-19 11:21:00,1426,  ...maybe he rinsed them off in the toilet bowl?
457117,Big Cliff,2010-04-17 17:21:00,6899,"I didn't see this first hand but I am very confident that my source is reliable.  It seems there were two rental boats fishing for crappie. A person who lives nearby watched them for a period of time and observed them keeping over 150 fish so he decided to call in a report.  For a change someone responded and the 4 fisher persons were caught with 400 crappie and some out of season bass. I really hope they throw the book at these people, perhaps it will send a message.  I know I for one am getting tired of this and carry my cell phone with me all the time when I am out on the water now. Anyone in the Kawarthas interested in becoming part of a fisheries watch program? It is time we gave the MNR a little help."
457121,Rattletrap2,2010-04-17 17:33:00,1652," I just don't get it Cliff. Why would anyone want or need 400 fish? That is absolutely nuts! I can feed a whole family with a couple of 1 1/2 pound fish a few times per year.  These numbers you mention here and the numbers talked about by the Rice Lake Tourist Assoc. in Rons post sound more like a commercial fishery than anything to do with ""Sport Fishing"". No one needs these numbers of fish for personal consumption. People keep a dozen Perch or Crappie and have a feast. Nothing wrong with that at all."
457122,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-17 17:34:00,0,Wanna bet that nothing much happens? You'd think a stroy like this would make it to a certain paper or something...  Didn't you say you had a reliable source?... Same thing out on the Bog the other day.
457124,Sinker,2010-04-17 17:36:00,8692,"Don't even get me started on this one Cliff. I've seen it twice this season as well. EVERY fish caught went right in the bucket. I am certain they were over limit, so I called, and no results. At least your story came up with results..........I hope they get nailed bigtime!!!  S."
457125,BillsTheBassMan,2010-04-17 17:44:00,932,It's stories like this one that make me put back everything I ever catch (unless I accidentally gutted it).  I have the mnr tips number and onstar handy at most times for such encounters as well.  It's a shame.  Good job on reporting them!
457126,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-17 17:45:00,0,  Nothing like being blatant.
457130,Terry,2010-04-17 17:52:00,14456," Damn Blatents, why do we let them in the 'Country        ..LOL"
457134,Slop,2010-04-17 17:59:00,151,"Wow, a small ray of sunshine on an otherwise cloudy day!"
457149,Big Cliff,2010-04-17 18:58:00,6899," Can you say ""taking them back to Toronto and selling them"". Can you say ""I have no respect for your laws or your resourses""? Can you say it is only about 1 in a 100 that get caught and to be honest most of the time they get off with a slap on the wrist and told not to do it again. But just let me get caught with one fish outside of the slot or over my limit and they would throw the book at me as an example to others."
457162,scugpg,2010-04-17 19:47:00,1373,Is there any way that pressure could be put on the rental places? Slim chance but maybe at least raise awareness or put up signs outlining what the actual limits are.
457165,fishnsled,2010-04-17 19:56:00,3520,  You would think that they might want to protect their future business.  Lower numbers of fish=fewer rental customers?  We all need to be ambassadors to our sport.  When something is going on that needs to be reported then pick up the cell and do it. Take as many pictures as you can and hope for the best.  In this case the best that could happen did thus far.
457167,jediangler,2010-04-17 19:59:00,1923,This is exactly why I was against opening the Kawarthas early. You know people are gonna abuse it.
457169,misfish,2010-04-17 20:07:00,29133,"Signs or not,hell you could sit in thier boat and yell at them.THEY DONT GIVE A crap.   I hear ya Cliff."
457173,Sinker,2010-04-17 20:28:00,8692," These guys would abuse it regardless.  The crew I watched a couple days ago were told about the new limit of 30 fish. Thier reply: ""mind yo business"" I was about ready to ram thier boat and sink it.  They know the rules, they just don't care, and they know nothing will come of being reported. I've reported this type of thing twice already, and saw no results.  If the MNR was smart, they'd be lined up at boat launches and rental places checking each boat as they leave the water.  MNR= Ministry of NO RESULTS  S."
457175,Big Cliff,2010-04-17 20:42:00,6899,"Well, maybe it is time we start to DEMAND results!"
457178,jat,2010-04-17 20:48:00,138,I was told from an angler who fishes the area that the police will indeed answer a call regarding poaching and trespassing.....so give the Cops a call and see what they say...can't hurt.
457181,misfish,2010-04-17 20:52:00,29133,"About 6 years ago, as many know,the perch fishing here in tha fall had made the word out and about.TV celibs, and word of mouth.Lots of people started fishing the bay here.LOTS OF PERCH TO BE HAD.One report about guys catching and bringing thier coolers to dock and then transfering them to land coolers, then heading out for another run, got word to the MNR.  Calling works, dont kid yourself.8 men were nabbed for over harvest,and thier boats were chained to a tree at the motel they were staying at,til they returned to pay thier fines.  I say, keep everything they have at the point,and what ever they used to get to the point inwhich they got to.  MNR IS NOT TO BLAME FOR THE INACTIVENESS.IT,S THE ONES THAT DICK TATE."
457183,pike n' whities,2010-04-17 20:56:00,131,"if i was still living down there i would be in the group for sure! but up here its a little hard to make a group like that cause theres so many natives up here its kinda hard to tell who is who. unlees you got bonocs or eagle vision haha. but yea even if the MNR hit up the st.mary's right downtown of sault ste. marie in the rapids they would catch ALOT of people angling illegally! snaggin... you name it, they do it. there's actually a video of a guy fishing in the rapids on youtube and he sees a seagull flying along so he casts and as the seagull runs into his line he pulls his rod back like he setting the hook.. he untangles it though. i think it flew away. anyhow if you wanna go check it out it should be there."
457197,bigugli,2010-04-17 21:42:00,6138,"Calling TIPS will work. It just takes time.  If you call and a CO is in the vicinity, he/she can act. Does not work if the CO is the other side of the county. TIPS is not 911 dispatch. It is an info source similar in some regards to Crimestoppers. The more calls placed to TIPS, the more attention will be paid to your specific area. It does not happen overnight. Repeat complaints have brought about enforcement blitzes in problematic areas, but requires drawing in extra manpower resources. I've seen 30-40 people get tagged in a single blitz. It happened because numerous repeat calls to TIPS helped them  identify a problem area. In Niagara we have 3 CO's  covering the region 24/7. 2 years ago we had 2 until they realized, from call volume, that resources were inadequate. Still not enough but an improvement."
457198,toca,2010-04-17 21:43:00,274,"If The MNR Could Throw The Book For People At The Humber In The Evening. Saw Some Pretty Wild Stuff There Especially The One With This Old Foriegn Dude. He Litterally Comes In With A 1-2 Oz Weight With A Hook And Rakes The Waters. Another was the drive by where one person would catch thier limit and some random Dude Just Shows Up And Grabs The Bag And The Guy Goes Fish For More. I Think In The Last Three Hours He Bagged Like 10 Salmons. Then Theres This Other Time When I Was Wading In The Water And This Salmon Looked Perfectly Fine and then just bellied up with its belly Cut Open For The Roe.  Anyways, Thought I Share My First Time Experiences In The Rivers"
457229,timmeh,2010-04-17 23:07:00,609," You're absolutely right here. And unfortunately this is the reason that some people turn to vigilante justice. You can only go on watching people rape our resources for so long without doing something.  And I don't think it's fair to blame the MNR though, they do what they can with the limited funding they have."
457234,bigugli,2010-04-17 23:21:00,6138," Blame has to rest with a justice system that dumbs down the punishments til there is no deterrent, and to the liberals and tories who, over 2 decades, have stripped the ministry's manpower and budget."
457239,timmeh,2010-04-17 23:46:00,609," Ya the MNR funding has been stripped no doubt, and with the debt our government took out to fight the recession I would suspect further cuts are probably (unfortunately ) in order.  I agree with the lack of punishment though. Here's a thought: The fine is set at $100 for EVERY fish you're over the limit. That would make people think twice."
457240,vinnimon,2010-04-17 23:48:00,2593,"I would like to know? What ever happened to the junior/coop/volunteer co program?Obviously it went down the tube!Donate your own time while fishing to observe and report if required.I know there are liability issues with that, but if it crops up again.Probably not!I had an interest in that program and it was gone when I was ready."
457241,skeeter,2010-04-17 23:50:00,1907,im with you on that cliff. i have there number already in my phone. 1 877 847-7667 is this the same number you have?
