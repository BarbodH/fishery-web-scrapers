457972,solopaddler,2010-04-19 23:13:00,8605,"  Well like Big Jim McBob and Billie S0L Hurok say, BLOW 'EM UP REAL GOOD! YEEHAW!     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bda_eIX3J2Y&feature=related"
457987,Paully,2010-04-19 23:40:00,712,I check this site out every now and then... http://www.trapper.ca/cnta/index.php
458091,LucG,2010-04-20 11:59:00,779, Well said and very true!
458095,bigugli,2010-04-20 12:30:00,6138,"You need A Fudd.    Or, ""this 'Fudd's' for you"""
458109,Carp,2010-04-20 13:38:00,1488,"There are probably 5 to 10 beavers shot around the area we deer hunt every season. Their dams flood the dirt the road and wash it out. (only car/truck access to the area) They also flood some prime habitat for the other creatures that live around the area.  Aside from introducing your current problem to a piece of hot lead, I'd say thick wire mesh or metal rods (or combination of the two) to block access to the dock would be a longer term solution. You could probably find materials needed at a scrap yard. Make sure whatever you do, it blocks all access to your dock. If you just block the door to the home, the beaver will get through in another spot.  Good luck !"
458122,cram,2010-04-20 14:29:00,1733,"i have to ask == are you sure its nto a muskrat or an otter?  I find it weird that a beaver is under your dock....they generally don't do that (i don't think), but muskrats and otters do all the time."
458127,jayess,2010-04-20 14:58:00,187,"outta curiousity, do you have a dog?  not a solution at all, just curious how adaptive are these beavers. being under a place where boats and footsteps are plentiful is surprising to me. to have a dog barking at you from time to time seems even more risky"
458136,davew3,2010-04-20 15:31:00,430,Save up about a gallon of urine and pour it throught the cracks of the dock.  mark your territory.  May work may not.  works on raccons. Good luck.
458382,Stern Rules,2010-04-21 06:50:00,342,I agree with that last statement. Well said.
458550,grt1,2010-04-21 20:33:00,638,"If you don't want to kill it, trap in alive and move it far away. There is a company in Wisconsin that makes live traps foalmost anything , the Tomahawk Live Trap company, their 800 number is 1-800-272-8727. you can also go online to tomahawklivetrap.com and check out their catalogue.  I have seen these traps and they tell me they sell a lot of them to the MNR in Ontario.  The people that run this company are very friendly and would be able to ship to you with no problem, But, I don't know the cost of the trap off hand.  Oh yes, this is a family run operation and have been in business for decades, and one of the guys that own it is a fishing fanatic and loves hunting so he is very approachable. His name is Greg Smith,"
458568,bigfish1965,2010-04-21 21:15:00,3382, Live trapping and moving a beaver far away is not allowed by law. I think the limit is 1 or 2 kilometers..which is not far enough to stop them form finding their way back.
458582,tb4me,2010-04-21 22:22:00,3295,"A friend had major problems due to damage from beavers. Oddly enough he got a new pet dog from the pound for his famly and the beavers dissapeared. The dog was a Jack Russel. They just left when she arrived, never to return..Just an idea"
458584,GBW,2010-04-21 22:26:00,8460,I wonder if you can get it to do this? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyD2aG2jMwI
458586,GBW,2010-04-21 22:31:00,8460,"Sorry, I just have to add this too. Is this Cudz on drums?!?!?!?!?! "
458590,gdelongchamp,2010-04-21 22:46:00,199,Just leave it. More structure in the water. Youll have grrreat fishing off the dock in no time.
458593,wuchikubo,2010-04-21 22:54:00,1114,"Plus, beavers are territorial and wouldn't survive if there is another beaver family in the vicinity."
458672,Stern Rules,2010-04-22 03:45:00,342,I knew I couldn't be the only one thinking it.
458693,moemoe,2010-04-22 11:50:00,352,"I pee on the dock in the spring, cause they are there every spring and it has worked every year so far"
458704,solopaddler,2010-04-22 12:31:00,8605, Me too. I don't have a beaver problem though.  Call it preventative maintenance.   
458851,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-22 22:58:00,655,"When I opened this thread, I expected to see photos of the... wild life.  Pesky critters are no fun. I had a bad squirrel problem once, now it's racoons and skunks. The latter bothers me most.  I had my backyard nicely landscaped last year and it has been trashed several times a week since."
458863,GBW,2010-04-22 23:48:00,8460,"I would guess skunk's are the worst for you being a show host...      Oh, different kind of skunking... sorry..."
457852,krawler,2010-04-19 17:30:00,167,"Need a quick fix, i have a beaver living under the dock at the cottage.  Its eating trees nearby and wreaking havoc on the landscape.  Basically need a quick fix to deter it from coming back.  Cannot board up the opening of the dock.  Is there a smell beavers dont like that i can spray on its bedding area that will prevent it from coming back?  Any help would be great.  I see one in the area every 3 years, usually they leave after throwing a few rocks and scaring it but this one seems to like my dock and the trees,any help would be greatlyappreciated.  krawler"
457853,Paully,2010-04-19 17:39:00,712,  Hire a trapper in your area.. They make great hats .. or winter mitts
457856,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-19 17:50:00,0, I know a person who can get rid of the problem if you like. It will cost you though. Where there is one there usually is more this time of year. Each one will cost.
457860,bigfish1965,2010-04-19 18:00:00,3382,Unfortunately there has been a massive increase in the population over the last five years. Trapping just delays the problem since another will soon move in. Beaver proof with heavy gauge mesh. Prevention is the only long term solution.
457862,The JAY,2010-04-19 18:03:00,239,"If I recall, they're really not fond of mothballs. Most rodents aren't. The only problem is that it's a short term bandaid."
457868,fishnsled,2010-04-19 18:13:00,3520,Where are you located Krawler?  I have a couple of buddies in wildlife control that may be able to help you out if it is in their area.
457869,Gerritt,2010-04-19 18:14:00,6129,Do what the locals do... .410  Then cage the crib up with wire mesh  G
457872,Headhunter,2010-04-19 18:21:00,5703,"I'd ""pelt"" it with rocks and then high ""tail"" is outta there! HH"
457875,LucG,2010-04-19 18:29:00,779," I'd hire a trapper before shooting it with a .410, that's for sure!  Sometimes, depending on where your located and if the season is still open, some trappers will help you out for minimum fee due to the fact that they will be able to market the pelt. Once the season is closed and the pelt value is no longer there, they will charge more. Again, this depends on where you are and who you ask. If I was in your area, I'd do it for free.  For me, its comparable to someone asking me to come catch the bass under their dock...or to take that buck that has been eating the garden...lol"
457878,solopaddler,2010-04-19 18:34:00,8605," For some reason, Quint, the old grizzled fisherman from Jaws just popped to mind.  "
457880,Guest gbfisher,2010-04-19 18:37:00,0,As each has already said. It will cost you to get rid of it. I have a few aboriginal friends who can do it for you ASAP.....
457883,backbay,2010-04-19 18:49:00,773,"Based on my own experience, there's not much you can do to discourage him from staying where he's set up shop. You have to remove him permanently."
457885,ketchenany,2010-04-19 19:00:00,3229,check this web intro  http://www.fwhp.ca/
457891,GBW,2010-04-19 19:21:00,8460,I'm shocked this hasn't goon downhill yet...  If you want it gone for good PM me and I can tell you one way to try that works well on raccoons so I hear...
457893,jedimaster,2010-04-19 19:46:00,3472,If there has even been a use for a potatoe cannon here is one for sure.
457900,cram,2010-04-19 19:56:00,1733,Rodents have good noses.  I'd try putting a batch of cayenne pepper on the wood under your dock.  Will cost you $3-4.
457904,LucG,2010-04-19 20:10:00,779,   What kind of advice is this? Come on guys...
457906,GBW,2010-04-19 20:16:00,8460,You could do this too but you would need to build a new dock after.  
457908,wuchikubo,2010-04-19 20:31:00,1114,Hire a local trapper. Where is the problem beaver located?
457926,troutboy,2010-04-19 21:16:00,125,Get a 330 conibear trap.
457941,bow slayer,2010-04-19 22:12:00,1074,"to think most guys I know would never ask for help in getting rid of some ""beaver""      they are usually trying to attact them"
457943,bigfish1965,2010-04-19 22:20:00,3382," A trap used by someone who is not a licensed trapper is not only dangerous but illegal. Like I said, trapping is not the answer...it may be part of the answer but not a resolution. As long as it a suitable place to live another beaver will take the spot. Each year the two year olds are driven from the family dens to find their own territory so there are always young beavers looking for new places to reside. Drive the beaver(s) out, make a suitable barricade and never worry about it again. If you rely on trapping alone, you will have to do it again and again."
457946,Roy,2010-04-19 22:26:00,13728,"There is no quick fix. Here's an interesting read for you, Krawler. http://www.pskf.ca/publications/beavers.htm"
457950,pike n' whities,2010-04-19 22:35:00,131,"  i just thought of this.... observe to see when the beaver leaves. make sure theres no other beavers in the house then BAM smash it up..... but who knows, that idea doesnt sound too logical either hahaha. good luck bud!"
457967,fisherman7,2010-04-19 23:06:00,325,"Why not just tell the beaver that there's someone with a better dock and better ""wood"" accross the lake. It's been my experience with beavers that they are always looking for better ""wood"".  Somebody had to say it and I guess it was me!"
