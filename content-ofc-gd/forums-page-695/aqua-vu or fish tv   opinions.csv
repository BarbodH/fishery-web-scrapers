458730,bow slayer,2010-04-22 14:43:00,1074,"thinking of buying an aquavu or fish tv  the cheap version only for entertaining purposes only,they are fairly cheap and i think the kids would really enjoy watching the fish below.Just like some opinions on them from owners or former owners and if anyone has one and no longer wants it i would be interested. thanks"
458732,bow slayer,2010-04-22 14:46:00,1074,if anyone could suggest a model or even a shop that has a good deal on them that would be greatly appreciated also. thanks
458801,Terry,2010-04-22 18:50:00,14456,the biggest problem with them is they are hard to see the screen in the sun light the Marcum vs 560 b/w or Marcum 825C color are the best ones I have see in direct sunlight but are more expensive 
458818,FisherMike,2010-04-22 19:49:00,108,the cabelas brand cameras are decent and fairly priced.  ive had no problems with mine.
458823,grt1,2010-04-22 20:05:00,638,"i bought a fish tv and it came with a bag that has screen shades on it, cost around $100 but I haven't tried it yet. Our lake is fairly stained water and when I used my buddies aqua vu the only time I could see the rocks is when i bounced the camera off them."
458838,johnl,2010-04-22 21:16:00,197,"i got the cheap canadian tire fish tv,you have yo cover the screen with your hand but besides that it works pretty good used it this winter on the ice and seen some perch sunfish and 2 nice bass"

458840,smitter,2010-04-22 21:48:00,106," I agree, I have a cabelas model and find it to be excellent. It was $200 plus shipping and tax."
458855,atvaholic,2010-04-22 23:07:00,271,"I have a aqua vu quad (4 cameras to get a 360 view). The camera itself works great, but the first time I used it, the camera got stuck on some timber on the bottom of the lake and would not come out. Ended up pulling the wires out.."
458882,vinnimon,2010-04-23 00:54:00,2593,"I once was in the same position.I went with the view.Im glad I did,its a little hard to see in sunlight.But I close the hut doors to view the screen.No biggie."
458911,GBW,2010-04-23 03:22:00,8460,"I have the fish tv and my kid's (6 and 3) love it.  it works well on the ice and I'll test it in the boat soon enough.  In fact, I'm the one itching to get it in the boat ASAP but that damn ""honey do list"" and b-day parties are killing me!"
458952,Fish Farmer,2010-04-23 11:58:00,2234,"You might think of getting the 100FT. cable. I've got the Aqua view with 50 cable and wish it was longer. My buddy has the Fish TV, it works great. They are hard to see in the sun. I use mine for ice fishing, in the hut or boat under the top. Plus if you have it on for long periods, consider an extra battery. The battery that came with mine only lasts a couple hours."
