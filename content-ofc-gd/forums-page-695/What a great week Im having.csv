For the non fishing.I went towork on monday, then on tues while going to job site the boss told me to call it quits.No problem,I was going to take another job in Milton.I arrived home and gotta a call from another employer.That afternoon, I went for an interview and was hired on immediately.They have been calling to reach me for a day or so. Before the interview, I called on one ofner and a friend who would give some insight before I returned the call. Im glad I did,the best bunch you can work for and along side of.Today was my second day and I found out an old friend of mine works in the office.Anyway, a great thanks for your input (you know who you are). And I can go fishing 5 days a week"
