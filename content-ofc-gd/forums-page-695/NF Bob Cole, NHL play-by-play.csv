458536,kickingfrog,2010-04-21 20:05:00,8333," I think it was a lifestyle thing for Harry. He has lived in the Buffalo area for years, and doing Sabres games meant a less rigorous travel schedule.   Has much as I liked them in the past, but now want them to retire, I think they would be two great guys to sit down and have a beer with. Harry's stories from his days coaching in the WHL are priceless."
458552,Grimace,2010-04-21 20:40:00,2020,"I loved Harry's line.  ""the 20 000 vezina trophy winners in the stands think Belfour should of had that."".   And who could forget kaberle's no shot clause in his contract.  Harry rules.  Don't forget folks the game has got a lot faster for these old fellas and with the salary cap a lot of call ups and more temperary players so the rosters change a lot more.  Wierd high numbers and more difficult names to pronounce.  Maybe you guys are right there time has passed but I still have a lot of affection for the old guys  sorry for the grammer. Stupid iPhone"
458808,muskeybugged,2010-04-22 19:09:00,282,"Bob Cole is the only announcer I knew growing up and I always wondered who would be the next one, he seemed old to me 20 years ago.  His voice is a staple of my hockey watching days and CBC is doing the right thing by gradually phasing him out as opposed to the Chris Cuthurt way out.  It's going to be tough to find someone to replace him as ""The Voice"" but I'm sure someone said the same about Foster Hewitt."

Too bad great announcer.  Still not as great as Dick Irvin tho, now I am showing my age. They need to get the guy that does the major junior games. He started as the Belleville Bulls announcer many years ago....... Just cant remember his name.     Rob Faulds?   Peter Lombardius?....""He Skiiiiioooorrrr's"""
458874,chris.brock,2010-04-23 00:21:00,4053,"I like Joe Bowen, he gets excited, always has a few laughs and seems like a nice guy. ""Holy Mackinaw"", we've found our new play by play guy!"
458877,Radnine,2010-04-23 00:34:00,1538," I hear you and I used to love Joe too. He was at his best when he was with Harry Neale, now that was classic TV. The problem that I have with Joe now is that he essentially is a Leafs broadcaster and is super biased (Holy Mackinaw! the Leafs got it over the blue line!). And as I get more and more sick of the establishment, I consider homies a part of the problem (yah, I know he's getting paid by them). And he also gets stuck with uber idiot Greg Millen. Do you know I actually heard Millen say during a Leafs Atlanta game (while Andropov was being booed by the Toronto fans) ""I don't know why they're booing, he had a lot of good years here"" Joe should have said ""Holy Mackinaw, you're a dumb ass!"" Jim"
458333,chris.brock,2010-04-21 01:33:00,4053,"I grew up with Bob Cole (Harry Neal too) covering the Leafs and play off games (most play off games didn't include the Leafs), I love the tradition and the Canadiana aspect, but I think it's time they found someone new, I find it hard to watch while listening to his many mistakes and oddly phrased descriptions and mental lapses, I find myself watching another play- off game just to avoid his commentary  a great hockey guy, but anyone else share the same opinion? or disagree?"
458335,kickingfrog,2010-04-21 01:37:00,8333,I feel almost the same way. A great one can hang on too long.
458337,Radnine,2010-04-21 01:54:00,1538,"  Agreed. It used to be super-brutal when it was him and Greg Millen (who is a complete moron). For the most part they have both been shifted. Jim Hughson and Craig Simpson are the main dudes now for Eastern games, and who cares about out west. I love TSN's coverage and hate Sportsnet's coverage (of regular season games, they are Leaf TV on main cable). Bob Cole and Don Cherry need to be put out to pasture. On a separate note, when my kid watches video of Gretzky's goals he says ""Dad, I could have scored on those goalies, they were crap"". There is tomorrow's fan for you. It is time to stop giving air time to guys that keep referring back to players and play that have been dead longer than most young people have been alive. What the hell does Darren Pang or Greg Millen know about the game today? Thanks for the opportunity to vent. Jim"
458339,kickingfrog,2010-04-21 02:03:00,8333,"Hey Radnine, if you think those guys are bad you should listen to some of the guys that TSN picks-up from the states when then use the feed from the home team. Truly sad, and completely one-sided."
458340,ADB,2010-04-21 02:04:00,444, Well then what does Craig Simpson know?  He is not that much older than Pang and Millen.
458343,BillM,2010-04-21 02:07:00,17367,Anything is better then the announcers on VS....  I really don't need the announcers to tell me what's going on in the game..  Nothing will ever come close to the Bob Cole/Harry Neal combo on CBC for Hockey Night in Canada.  Two of the greats for sure.
458353,Grimace,2010-04-21 02:25:00,2020,"I really miss Harry Neale.  He made me laugh countless times.  Some people just have that.  I liked him with Joe Bowen, they had a great chemistry.  As for Bob Cole, give the man some credit.  When Foster Hewitt was calling the summit series on television Bob Cole was calling it on radio.  The man has been doing it for a long time, and with class.  There is a certain way a hockey game should be called, the way in which the commentator adds to the game by following the tensity level of the play with his voice.  Bob Cole had that in spades for 35 years.  He did not draw to much attention to himself either, he just called the game.   I wish some of the guys out there now would just call the game, but they are way too interested selling themselves and not the game.  Raise your glass to Bob Cole, he might not be bringing his A game at 77 years old but we will miss him when he is gone.  And nope your kid could not score on those goalies."
458361,Daplumma,2010-04-21 02:45:00,1961,"Very home team biased,sorta like baseball.We have Craig laughlinand Joe Beninati rootin my Caps on the local channals.Craig is from the Great White North but played with the Caps in the mid 80's.He was not pleased with the Habs fans booing the American national anthem last night.The Caps fans didn't boo the Canadian National anthem the first two games of the series.I wil say that y'alls anthem sounds better and sings easier than ours but ours shouldn't be booood just because you dont like our hockey team. Joe"
458365,ctdd2006,2010-04-21 02:58:00,531,  More to do with politics I'm afraid than the hockey team and them hab fans....albeit not all of them can be classless!  It's the separatist thing....I'm pretty sure most other rinks in canada wouldn't boo any anthem other than perhaps a middle east one.  Cheers!
458391,solopaddler,2010-04-21 08:55:00,8605,Bob Cole kind of reminds me of Bob Uecker's character in Major League.  
458395,Radnine,2010-04-21 10:44:00,1538," How about the fact that the guys that they bring on are always cement heads? Matt Barnaby, Tie Domi, Bob Clarke, etc.    Agreed. I never said he was good, just that he is the go to guy now (for better or worse)  Jim"
458407,asdve23rveavwa,2010-04-21 12:08:00,2690,"Sad to say, but, I agree as well.  Bob and Harry used to be the best, no doubt, but, his time has long passed.  Jim Hughson has been the best for a number of years, IMO."
458413,JohnF,2010-04-21 12:38:00,3494,"Hockey would be more enjoyable if they even just got rid of that bombastic ass Cherry. And if i never hear ""Holy mackinaw"" again it will be too soon. I was just commenting to my wife last night that if you were listening to the game on the radio with these same announcers it would look a lot different in your head that what I was seeing on tv. They make so many blunders and miscalls that are just ignored. Of course that could describe the refs too. Is the game getting too fast for them all?  JF"
458414,crappieperchhunter,2010-04-21 12:54:00,2582," I agree 100%. Coaches corner for me is pee break,snack break or beverage break. And I make sure it is over before I return to the TV.  Cole too. I can't believe the number of mistakes he makes.  Both icons of our great game.  But both should be put out to pasture.  I hope that if I ever get to that stage of embarrassing myself, Debbe takes me aside and says ""Honey its time to let the kids take over the reins""."
458415,John the Fisherman,2010-04-21 12:59:00,45,"The only good thing that came from the NHL strike a number of years ago was that we did'nt have to listen to ""Pierre McQuire"".  I wish NBC would sign him exclusively, and leave TSN.  I was wondering if Pierre sends his recipients of his ""McQuires Monster"" a little trophy?  I am sure Malkin, or Whoever, gives a rats ass about being one of his ""Monsters""  HA  JTF"

458434,steelhead197,2010-04-21 13:52:00,38," I think they should bring in Keith Jones......you see him there sometimes...why not get him in the game so to speak! the guy knows hockey, has played it, and Jonesey sure can call it!! My vote is for the ""Brantford"" boy...Keith Jones!!"
458436,troutologist,2010-04-21 13:58:00,951,"I get a kick out of him. I clearly remember a bit of banter Bob and Harry had a while back  ""Ever see hockey gloves as short as they are right now?""  ""No, worms could bite your wrist if you were digging in the garden""   I am one to vote that Pierre McGuire is never allowed near a World Juniors broadcast in any capacity again."
458441,anders,2010-04-21 14:17:00,1168,"They were good...and like anything had there moment in the sun, and will definitly be icons never to forget, however...its time.  Jim Hughson and Craig Simpson IMO are great....Jim is fantastic at calling games...its too bad that the Bruin/Sabre series has Greg Millen and Dean Brown WHO?? Brown makes Millen sound like Foster Hewitt.  As for McGuire...not worth even mentioning...Giant bag of loser he is..he can ruin a hockey game, just by being present.  How no NHL player has driven the puck into his little cubical between the benches is beyond me."
458444,torco,2010-04-21 14:43:00,656,Give me Bob Cole over most. Although I do like Jimmy Hughson and Chris Cutherberson who use to do hockey night in canada late game. I think he is with TSN but often times they have Gord Miller and that boob McGuire doing games.
458465,JohnF,2010-04-21 15:50:00,3494,"Funny, but I don't really mind Pierre. I could live without his monsters, ""top shelf"", and a few other catchy little expressions he uses, but he catches a lot of little things in the play from his little hidey hole at ice level. My wife hates listening to him, but then she always leaves the game at 7:30 to watch Jeopardy so what does she know?  JF"
