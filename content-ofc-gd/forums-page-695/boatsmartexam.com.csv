458678,tb4me,2010-04-22 04:34:00,3295,Funny here I was taking this seroius. It seems as thou most take this as a joke. Although the test was rather simple I was glad to have taken it the right way.
458708,anders,2010-04-22 12:55:00,1168,the whole process is a joke...
458718,troutologist,2010-04-22 13:44:00,951,There was a test???   I thought you just gave $$ and got the card....
458723,Sudzy,2010-04-22 14:09:00,88," I agree it now is... I got mine right when it came out - had to take the test in a classroom.  Anyone can get one now that you can do it online with a ""supervisor""."
458733,diggyj,2010-04-22 14:50:00,548, You are right about that.  Just put a buddies name and address in like the vast majority of people do and you're good to go. Unless you don't have any friends?  Dirk
458736,anders,2010-04-22 15:04:00,1168,"i registered as a supervisor, and people were bringing me there codes for the test...i would do it in 5 minutes, and then get reimbursed for it....up here, the majority of the test is useless to us...there are no beacons, buoys or for the most part lack of high traffic areas.  our buoys consists of empty javax and tide bottles"
