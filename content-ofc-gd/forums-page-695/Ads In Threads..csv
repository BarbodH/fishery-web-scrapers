454930,Moosebunk,2010-04-12 07:11:00,3970,"Sorry Roy... but it's still driving me nuts bud.  Since the changes to OFC I have used several different computers (home and away) and they're all getting the same crap.  What the problem is, is that I'll open some bigger topic threads such as other peoples (and my own old) reports and find annoying advertisements destroying them.  ie., ads will pop up right in the middle of text anywhere in the persons post.  Or, ads will cut photos in half.  Or, ads will block me from seeing photos.  There is almost always an ad placed as the first reply to a topic as well.  They're not pop-up ads either, they're cut right into the post much like someone's reply.  I am very curious to know if others are seeing these ads in this way as well?  Are they even showing up on your screens at home or work?  And if so, why the devil hasn't anyone else spoken up about them before?  They're Bull.  Rick... TJ... anyone.... is this something new this site has implemented?  Are you still working out some kinks?  Will they go away?"
454931,Terry,2010-04-12 08:56:00,14456,what ads?????  I don't get them
454933,Terry,2010-04-12 09:49:00,14456,"ok  I logged out and viewed as a guest and got ads but if I log back in , no ads....except classified section.... .....that's what I found....."
454935,corvette1,2010-04-12 10:11:00,1765,i have no ads on my end
454940,Fish Farmer,2010-04-12 10:22:00,2234,"None my end, maybe something to do with popup blocker"
454945,Moosebunk,2010-04-12 10:39:00,3970," Terry... I hadn't noticed that.  You've totally pinned it.  Just checked Solo's, Aaron's and a couple of my old reports and it didn't do it while logged in."
454946,lew,2010-04-12 10:47:00,12766,"I also get them if I'm logged out MB, but they just appear as a normal reply and don't interfere with the post or block pictures  at all.  The ad I see in this post is for improving your golf swing"
454947,Moosebunk,2010-04-12 10:48:00,3970," Checking logged out it does.  This morning not so many ads... but they've been worse then better at different times.  Guests see them..... kinda sucks cause like I said, sometimes they're in the way of photos and text, and those guests are people like my parents maybe.  Been out of town nearly 4 weeks.  Hope to see how it is on the home computer this week."
454948,Moosebunk,2010-04-12 10:53:00,3970," Yeah, I've been seeing that one too Lew... comes up as the first reply in every thread.  Through the night I was looking at posts though where it was some Fitness add that cut right through a scenic photo in my old Arctic Report, and was in another report too.  And also, a Couples add in either that post or some other one... right in the middle of a report.  If it's spam for guests so be it.  But like I say, it's sad that it ruins posts for those guests of yours."
454950,Moosebunk,2010-04-12 10:54:00,3970,Thanks for replying though guys.
454953,fshrgy99,2010-04-12 11:13:00,9,I've spent a few hours on the board this weekend and haven.t seen a single one but years ago they were everywhere. It may be that I've blocked them ... but maybe you've downloaded some spyware or adware. Run a diagnostic. I use AVG antivirus. Maybe someone else has another adware checker they can recommend.
455057,tb4me,2010-04-12 16:51:00,3295,I dont ever get anything you describe. I may get a small ad after the first post but it never cuts into another persons post.
455092,fishermccann,2010-04-12 18:10:00,655,No ads in the way if I am logged in.
455143,aplumma,2010-04-12 21:00:00,6896,I am using mozilla with no issues. The only add I get is in the header and if I am not logged in then the 2nd post is an ad. You can P.M. Rick with the info on your computer so he can see what the issue is.   Art
455145,Big Cliff,2010-04-12 21:10:00,6899,I haven't had the problem at all! (so far)
455146,Kinger,2010-04-12 21:10:00,351,AdBlockPlus 1.1.3  and Firefox = No advertisements on the entire internet. I haven't seen an ad in so long.  Advertisements are more annoying than black flies.
455157,Billy Bob,2010-04-12 21:52:00,5865, It's not too often I see someone quote themselves...  BTW no adds on my end at anytime.  Bob
455170,Mattones,2010-04-12 22:27:00,587,I saw them too.. but then I went to reply and noticed I was logged out hahahaa
458472,Lunkerhunter,2010-04-21 16:11:00,455,"i do notice them every now and again.  if you do find an add cutting a picture in half just click once on the picture and i find it figures itself out after that.  give it a try, seems to work for me"
458476,TC1OZ,2010-04-21 16:26:00,987,"Its operating as normal. If you don't register you get ad's, if you register (and log in) you don't get ads (minus the classifieds)."
458503,spinnerbaitking,2010-04-21 17:35:00,1622,Maybe it's a ploy to get everyone to Register & Log-in & it might even be a good one NO PROBLEM HERE HAHA keep up the good work guys Richard
458516,TJQ,2010-04-21 18:32:00,7806,"Sorry I didn't get this to everyone sooner. yes if you are not logged in as a member there are additional ads in the threads. WE figure that if your lurking and at least not registered, looking at a few more ads is the least they can do."
458519,Mykester,2010-04-21 19:26:00,241,"Like many others, I don't see them in posts. Occasionally I'll catch one in between, but it's not bothersome. Try switching to Firefox if you haven't done so."
458572,aplumma,2010-04-21 21:31:00,6896,The ads aren't so bad after all they pay the bills for the cool updates and all of the internet fees we enjoy for free. Besides I found a few products that I wanted from opening a couple of them.    Art
458592,Jewelbee,2010-04-21 22:53:00,422,Nope...Nothing wrong here!
