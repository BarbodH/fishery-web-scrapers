458719,davew3,2010-04-22 13:47:00,430,Good morning.  With the opener only a short time away I am wondering if anyone can report on the levels. I hope to put in at our camp by Shannonville but I think I will have to head to Deseronto.  Is the first ramp by the bridge good to go?  I have never put in there and I imagine Deseronto is going to be one busy place. Any info would be appreciated.  Regards

At the launch ramps by where Walleye World will be the water looks to be down about 2 feet! Actually, I suspect quite a few boats may have difficulty launching due to the low water."
458901,duber,2010-04-23 02:28:00,220,Water levels are still way down.Some launches will be a no go for bigger boats.The ramp by the bridge is do-able but you have to back off the cement and there is a lip there.Check it out before you launch.
