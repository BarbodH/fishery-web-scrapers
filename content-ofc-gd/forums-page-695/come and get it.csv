454357,grt1,2010-04-10 18:22:00,638,"I have this 1976 starcraft supersport that has been out of the water since 2001 when I bought my new boat. I had a buddy who wanted it but he has since backed out. Therefore, it is free to anyone who wants to come and get it. The boat has a couple dings (not bad ones) and is missing a rivet in the rear but it is easily accessable to repair. The boat has been renovated with a casting platform but I'm sure this could be a great winter project for someone to restore. I have the side rails and top frame for it too. the trailer has to stay (my son's) and the motor is his also and will be removed  Here's a picture (hope this works)    first come, first served, the boat is too good to go to the dump"

A friend and I are considering doing a fishing vacation on Pakwash Lake up in your area. I was wondering if you could give us some feed back on the lake and maybe recommend a resort on the lake or in that area if you could. Also any opinions on Pakwash Provincial Park that you may have would also be greatly appreciated. thanks."
