458985,bushart,2010-04-23 14:19:00,2628,Now I've got a fair idea with every freshwater gamefish on where they may be----BUT---this crappie stuff is kinda new to paint boy.  Now my intel says there is these flat critters in my local lake and another nearby---planted and not normal to the lake.  Now I tried last year with what and where they may be----all I ended up with was oos bass and rock bass and sunnys.  I tried micro tubes and bobbers and some gulp---nuthin.  Now I'm fishing rather large lakes (10 mile-ish long)--fishin inflowing rivers and weedbeds---fished up river---zip-zip and nada. Lakes have healthy populations of top predators (me being one  )  Any ideas on temps and placement would be mucho appreciato
459060,Ron,2010-04-23 18:42:00,1683,"Temp is more important to Crappie than any other fish. (Other than Brookies and Atlantics). If you find water temps at 56-57 degs, your golden.  Look for colored water in shallow Bays. Best bays are ones with a narrow opening at the mouth. Don't look for deep water in these bays. Best is less than 3 ft. Crappie look upwards so be sure to have your offering up high in the water column. I am fishing as short as 8 inches below my float in 3ft of water.  Some lakes the Crappies have moved out of the bays are getting ready for stage along the inside weelines. These areas will have a sand bottom with new emergent growth off the bottom.  So some searching by covering water. Use the small beetle spins. Don't worry about short strikes at this point. You are more concerned to find at least one active fish in the area. Once you do, slow your presentation down by using tubes under a float. Pay special attention on where you got the hit or caught your first Crappie. You could be the mark by 10 ft and you won't see another fish some times. Once you find where they are hitting, then broaden your area for searching. Find a confidence color to work with too. I always start off with a 2 tone - as long it is a Chartreuse tail (that's my confidence color).  Don't overlook small crank baits either.  Cheers, Ron..."
