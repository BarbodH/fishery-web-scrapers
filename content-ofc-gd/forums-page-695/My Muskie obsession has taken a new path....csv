458667,gone_fishin,2010-04-22 03:20:00,481,"So i finally got around to ordering some lure making materials to tie my own in-line muskie spinners...  i missed a couple components in my original order, so i'm gonna have to wait to tie up a few colours that i'm really excited to make... those will be coming soon...  but anyways... on to my first three creations...     the classic black and red... i couldn't find any of these in stores last year... so inevitably i had to make one...    i had some success last year with black and orange, so i decided to invert that combo... although i wish i had added more black feathers throughout the body... and i was kinda disappointed with the orange marabou... it isn't very thick... hopefully that doesn't show too badly in the water...    and my latest creation... i know i've just started this hobby, but i think i've outdone myself already...  my original plan was just a plain black and white skunk pattern... then i thought of adding some red feathers... then when i reached the end of the white, i added some black feathers for the transition... then finished off all of the black and it looked like it was still missing something... so i added a bit of white to top it all off... sometimes i even shock myself with the stuff i come up with... though i'm sure it's been done before. lol.  i think this may be my new favourite muskie lure!!!    yellow/red will be made when i get the gold hardware in my next order. and the classic black/orange with orange blades will also be done when i get some paint for the blades. among others. lol.  44 days till MUSKIE OPENER!!!!!"
458671,Syn,2010-04-22 03:32:00,519,"Very very nice! I love how the long feathers are spaced out so nicely. To my surprise I heard pink/black is another good colour pattern. Orange/ black has been my old time favorite though. Tons of ideas for reference colour pattern/hook placement, etc on ebay."
458676,Dozer,2010-04-22 04:27:00,896,Crisp!
458684,Roy,2010-04-22 09:33:00,13728,Looking good. Very nice baits indeed.
458685,Weeds,2010-04-22 09:43:00,782,"I agree, very nice. What size are the blades?"
458687,Rich Clemens,2010-04-22 10:26:00,3131,Those will make any fish in the neighborhood hungry.  Nice work indeed.
458688,splashhopper,2010-04-22 10:36:00,2931,"If I were a muskie, I would eat those"
458691,singingdog,2010-04-22 11:01:00,1047,Nice spinners. Just a warning: you have started down a dangerous path....get out now if you plan on getting out at all.
458735,Spiel,2010-04-22 14:59:00,9065,Looks like some mighty fine craftsmanship.
458738,mepps,2010-04-22 15:08:00,1301,"very well done, keep it up!"
458746,bdox,2010-04-22 15:27:00,329,"What is the weight on these? From what I've been told, those big blades require a good amount of weight if you want to fish them any deeper than 6"""
458751,fish-miester,2010-04-22 15:31:00,864,lookin good. If I was a musky I'd go for the bloody seagul pattern you have got there
458784,Joey,2010-04-22 17:44:00,9122,"Very nice indeed.  I've been busy cranking out some musky lures aswell.  I love how much faster it is to make a lure with maribou than with bucktail.  A different look of course, but I like them.  Joey"
458820,gone_fishin,2010-04-22 19:53:00,481,"thanks for the compliments everyone!  the blades are size 8 and there is a 5/8 oz egg weight buried at the bottom of the marabou. should be enough to get it down a couple feet at least. plus the beads and body piece are solid metal, so there is a fair bit of weight on these baits."
458822,kickingfrog,2010-04-22 20:02:00,8333,I don't think those will work at all. I'll get rid of them for you.
458852,Handlebarz,2010-04-22 22:59:00,3790,very nice looking for sure keep up the great work cant wait to see the others and the fish caught on them.
458857,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-22 23:15:00,655,Very nice bucks!  It is really gratifying catching fish on your own creations
458867,Dara,2010-04-22 23:59:00,3052,"  The 3rd one right?  I was calling it. ""A snowballs chance in hell""  Bunny for breakfast also works"
458880,gone_fishin,2010-04-23 00:42:00,481," LOL. i was thinking ""Road-kill Skunk"" but i like the other suggestions also."
458903,Pigeontroller,2010-04-23 02:31:00,2793,Those look great! Nice work.
