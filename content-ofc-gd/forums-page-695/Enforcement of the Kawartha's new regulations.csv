Considering all the ice huts and anglers on area lakes this winter and the full boat lauches this spring. I would have to say we have had a fantastic positive response to the new angling opportunities here in the Kawartha's. I certainly have been enjoying them. $2,500_in_Fines_for_Four_Kawartha_Lakes_Ice_Fishermen.pdf"
458511,ecmilley,2010-04-21 18:19:00,2163,"thanks for the update, I know I have been enjoying having the boat out early"
458520,Slop,2010-04-21 19:29:00,151,"When I did my survey for FMZ17, I specifically noted my concerns about poaching. It's fantastic that there are these new oppertunities and equally fantastic that the MNR is out there enforcing the laws."
458526,basketclam,2010-04-21 19:50:00,115,"It's nice to see that the officers went the court route to set up some precedence with these cases, rather than issuing tickets.  I wonder how many other guys were given tickets for similar offences, or did the CO's get the word from on high that everything was to go straight to court?  Thanks for posting the article Mike."
458576,Big Cliff,2010-04-21 21:46:00,6899,Thank you so much for posting that. I'm sure there were a lot that didn't get caught but it shows that there is a chance that you will.

458768,muskeybugged,2010-04-22 16:11:00,282,The Curve lake Residence - is that not a native reserve?  I thought they had no rules as long as it is not for profit.... only to serve they're community....enlighten me
458776,Big Cliff,2010-04-22 16:34:00,6899,"just because you live on the reserve, doesn't mean you are native indian."
