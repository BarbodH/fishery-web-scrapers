458073,kenzy31,2010-04-20 04:27:00,261,"looking for input from fellow members having experience with this unit.  it's on sale this week at CT for $199.  have one on hold to pick up before Thursday, but looking for input, good and bad.  going on a 18' Princecraft, late 70's range, with a 60hp Johnson.  looking for a pic to give you an idea, will post later.  i think 40lb thrust transom mount should be fine for whitie/laker jigging, pike/bass excusions.   thanks, Jesse  ** can't get pic to load from photobucket of the boat...any help?**"

458130,tb4me,2010-04-20 15:02:00,3295,IMO 40lbs isint enough for that large of a boat..I just went thru this on the weekend..Does that transom mount motor come with a foot pedal? Do any transom mounts come with a foot pedal for that matter?
458131,NAW,2010-04-20 15:21:00,4022,It's to light.  Go bigger. You will regret getting the 40#.
458135,tb4me,2010-04-20 15:31:00,3295,i just picked u the 55lb powerdrive $568.00 at crappy tire..$100 off on sale all week
458380,waterwolf,2010-04-21 04:36:00,556,"just bought a 40 for my tinnie ,, you're under-powered."
458408,skeeter,2010-04-21 12:13:00,1907,  are you pulling water skiers? LOL
458610,waterwolf,2010-04-21 23:39:00,556," used 3o lb's before didn't cut it in the wind, was disappointed"
458625,tb4me,2010-04-22 00:24:00,3295,Yikes I just picked up a 55lb powerdrive for my 14.5.. However I fully expect a new boat in the near future so i made sure I bought one that will work on a 17 or 18 ft
458717,kenzy31,2010-04-22 13:44:00,261,thanks to all replied.  decided to hold out for something bigger.  55lb or more.  i would rather be over powered than under!!  thanks again!
