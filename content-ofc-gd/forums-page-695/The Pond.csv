White perch and drum are moving in. As are the big schools of shiner. A little sampling from today.   Despite the fact it looks like a stink hole, it is still a spawning ground for major sportfish. Found a couple of frye in my baitnet making their way out to the lake.   What a great way to spend 5 hours."

458841,crappieperchhunter,2010-04-22 21:52:00,2582,Great looking day to be out. A multi species report too  Is that little guy an ATLANTIC
458853,waterwolf,2010-04-22 23:00:00,556,stress relief. nice way to spend a day 'specially thru the work-week.
458873,bigugli,2010-04-23 00:19:00,6138,"IF it's an Atlantic, there are going to be a lot of very surprised biologists. Place hasn't been stocked in well over 20 years with chinook and rainbow, not sure about browns"

458910,BillM,2010-04-23 03:21:00,17367,"I don't think that little fish is heading anywhere... If he goes out to the lake, he'll be dinner in no time..  He should be hanging out there for a few years unless it gets way to warm in the summer.."

458917,basskicker09,2010-04-23 03:33:00,144,it gets way to warm in those ponds to hold the trout in summer  me and the women and her friend went out there yesterday and did quite well between the two girls they caught over thirty fish i on the other hand have caught two and not just two for the trip two fish for the open water season
458963,bigugli,2010-04-23 13:00:00,6138,Water temps get to be soup warm with 0 flow by summer. Not a good place for wee trouties.
458975,limeyangler,2010-04-23 13:39:00,5204,Great place to wet a line Bruce......do you need any blackflies sent down?
