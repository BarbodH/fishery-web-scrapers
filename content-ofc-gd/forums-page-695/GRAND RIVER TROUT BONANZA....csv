Here's a pic of them bunched up, don't know if you can see them clearly (Blackberry Camera).    Also took a pic of the first sucker I caught.    Nice little surprise, pulled like a macktruck and even gave me a jump. We'll call him a whisker trout    Get out there and enjoy."

458285,bassman87,2010-04-20 23:11:00,586,i didnt really see anyone. i was float fishing so pinning seemed logical to me

458292,jediangler,2010-04-20 23:26:00,1923,Get out and enjoy? I think I'll wait till the season opens before I venture out sucker fishing in a trout stream.

458309,dave524,2010-04-21 00:33:00,4508," I wouldn't really classify the Grand below Caledonia as a trout stream, if trout made up more than a couple of percent of the fish I'd be surprised, and those are seasonal fish at that."
458316,jediangler,2010-04-21 00:55:00,1923,He doesn't specify where on the Grand he is fishing Dave and with the post title GRAND RIVER TROUT BONANZA all in caps he's surely trolling for a reaction from other members.
