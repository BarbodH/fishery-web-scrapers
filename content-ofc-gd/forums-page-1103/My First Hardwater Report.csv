146442,Mike the Pike,2007-12-30 03:16:00,3421,"Well the time finally came to go ice fishing for the first time this Winter.  I was so pumped up and ready but this was my first ever Skunking on the ice .NO FISH  NODDA A SNIFF.  I loaded up the Van  and began to round up my many passengers My friend GlennK(some of you met in Quinte)his son Andrew,my brother in law Chris,my Nephew Trevor(His first time ice fishing)and my son Ryan who will outlast us all for determination and effort.We headed up to Northern Quebec not far from Mont-Tremblant Ski resort.  Well you think what better way to catch fish bring my nephew to an outfitter for his first time .Nope Wrong No speckled trout and no rainbows.Thats fishin  Despite no fish we turned our day into alot of fun.Could not have had better weather very mild conditions none of our holes in the ice froze over all day.Can't wait for the ice to thicken up here near home.we were fortunate enough to be fishin on 12 inches of ice today.  Here are some pics.   Another day that starts at Lew O'clock.Slowpoke this shot is for you Bud   my gang minus me. uncle Chris top left my so Ryan  bottom left.Nephew Trevor and Andrew and his Dad GlennK.     My new toy works well it did show a branch at the bottom but too bad the trout were at the other end of the lake.   Yes fishing can be tough at times.         Now you've all heard of Camp Jiggy Jiggy well this is Fort Jiggy jiggy.   As my son walks by I notice his eye swelling up.upon close examination it looks pretty bad but no need for medical attention. It seems he dinged his eye on the sled pulled by the Ski-Doo earlier this morning .He said it didn't hurt.Never told me Sorry for the pics of the dried boogers and smeared hot chocolate.      What service from the outfitter wood deliverie although we had plenty.   This is our new fishin Buddy.The bite was so dead we just made the best of the day and built our selves a fishing mascot.Funny all the birds took off.     Now our new friend lied to us here he is telling us how big the trout was but it got away.   We did have one helluva snow ball fight and the kids had a blast throwing snowballs at Glenn and I as we tried desperately to catch trout.My Nephew became so annoying I chased him a couple of times but the 2nd time I fell really hard on the ice hitting my elbow. Which hurts like hell and is very swollen.Man I am getting old I came so close to catching the little bugger .Still have my speed just no more endurance balance or durability.Now I know how Terry felt this week  NOW PETER AKA(BITE ME) I know your missing my big yellow Tweety suit so Peter I have decided to make it up to you.Sorry too warm for the big yellow survival suit.  Are you ready!!!!!!!!   Scroll down   So Peter what do you think of this tie.I bought it for you for Christmas Bud. I hope you like it  Well folks sorry for the lack of fish but sometimes you just have to make the best of the day. I look forward to the next ice fishin adventure.  MTP"
146446,Terry,2007-12-30 03:23:00,14456,too bad about the lack of fish but it was a really good report    oh and nice tie....yeah  not
146453,Dondorfish,2007-12-30 03:30:00,1000,Great report Mike! Looks like a nice place. That is quite the sleigh that they use as a people mover. Don't worry about the skunk - Ice Fishing is just getting started - you'll get'em next trip.   Just got to ask - does anybody else notice that the snowman has a striking resemblance to T.J.    Don
146454,irishfield,2007-12-30 03:31:00,26272, Can't be... it's upright....
146457,Dondorfish,2007-12-30 03:39:00,1000,Good point Wayne!   Don   
146473,medmart,2007-12-30 08:49:00,587,Great report no fish but thats OK it looks like you had a great day with family and friends  rob
146476,SlowPoke,2007-12-30 09:12:00,2984,"Great report Mike, thanks for the alarm clock shot! It's a good thing your new friend didn't outfish you, that would have been really embarassing! -Brian"
146480,Roy,2007-12-30 09:48:00,13728,"Thanks for the report, Dude. That Ryan fella is a tough little guy when it comes to fishing eh?  I have to wonder at the mental stability of a guy who gets up in the middle of the night to take a picture of his clock radio though."
146489,b2kptbo,2007-12-30 13:43:00,1505,"Looks like a little village on the ice, thats a cool sled, too bad about the skunk but looks like ya had a good time. Thanks for the report... (don't know about the tie???)"
146508,Greencoachdog,2007-12-30 14:23:00,8163,"Great report and pics Mike!!!  I feel sorry for the Tadpoles, they're definately Troopers! You'd better watch out for Ryan, that dinged up eye is definately going to earn him a big fish in the near future with the Fishing Gods!  I see one of your old fishin' buddies followed you out on the ice...  See ya next time Mikey!!!"
146602,Joey,2007-12-31 00:00:00,9122,"Hahahahaha, super report Mike.  Love the snowman.  Too bad about the skunk, maybe the tie was too bright and scared them  Joey"
146639,fishindevil,2007-12-31 02:18:00,6254,"Great report mike !!!..  .too bad about the fish,not wanting to come out and play !!..it looked like a great spot for sure....very nice scenery...oh well better luck next time,and i hope the little guys eye is alright....cheers bud"
146651,holdfast,2007-12-31 02:56:00,1813,"Excellent Pictures Mike.  I loved going to the Laurentians to visit my Brother in Val David close to Ste Agathe.  Mostly to fish Brookies in the Doncaster River.  A spot beside Mohawk land (Hint).  There is no lake in Algonquin park that could beat this place for Brookies.  What I like about the area is the pristine waters and its less than an hour from Montreal.  Lets see, what I know, Excellent bass and pike in Lake Champlain Vermont.  Landlocked Salmon and Rainbow trout in Memphremagog lake, And walleye, Bass, Trout in the Laurentians.  Not to mention trout in thee Lachine Rapids.  Only 45 minutes or less from Mtl."
146662,Mike the Pike,2007-12-31 03:28:00,3421, Yup your memory is right on dude.Still the same.unfortunately the Mont-Laurier region is getting fished out so you have to drive to Reservoir Gouin for the better walleye fishing.The Lanaudiere region remains tops for trout fishin 45 minutes North of Joliette.  
146678,carll2,2007-12-31 05:06:00,443,"awesome report mike  i was thinking of heading up to the baroux while im up north for the holidays but i decided to come back in town and try one of my eye spots, sucks you didnt catch anything but theres always next time"
