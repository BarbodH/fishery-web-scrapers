146328,trapshooter,2007-12-29 20:24:00,1234,"Nice eye's.  It's amazing what they'll cram down the gullet and then still hit something else.  They're oportunistic feeders and when instinct says ""that's food"" they react.  I caught a big pike this spring that had 4"" of tail sticking out its throat."
146331,Tarzan's Jane,2007-12-29 20:33:00,1183,"Wow, that's pretty cool.  Take it as a sign of a year of 'plenty' to come."
146332,misfish,2007-12-29 20:34:00,29133,"Well I had heard word you did good today.The wife couldnt wait to call me at WORK. I must say I am surprised you only got the two.
