It's about that stupid ""system access fee (SAF)"" in ur cellphone monthly plan... which most ppl nowadays know is nothing but a cash-grab yet can't do anything about it. The SAF is NOT a government fee, it's nothing, it's simply a ""fee"" cellphone companies have so to make the monthly plan fee  looks cheaper than it really is.  http://www.thestar.com/Business/article/258049   IF YOU WISH TO JOIN THE CLASS ACTION AGAINST CANADIAN'S CELLULAR COMPANIES:  http://www.merchantlaw.com/cellular.html   Now of course, with these big companies and how much money is involved, this can drag on for years.  But what u can possibly benefit NOW... is call your current cellphone company, and ask to have the SAF waived. I've heard of more and more ppl that got the SAF waived recently. Of course, you'll have more leverage to bargain for it if ur contract is soon expiring or already expired or ur simply in a monthly term. But either way, it doesn't hurt to try.  Hope at least some, if not all, of u can benefit from it I hate that SAF crap for years!"
