Not only that but the second any info about such things gets posted here you WILL have to leave about 2 hours earlier than you would have just to get a decent spot because it will be too crowded otherwise.... that is if they aren't still frozen solid."
145568,reelinrolly,2007-12-26 22:06:00,281,I guess thats why I am hoping someone will be nice enough to shoot me a pm  Id drive on up there but I have no wheels....trying to get the conditions so I can go up with a buddyy.
