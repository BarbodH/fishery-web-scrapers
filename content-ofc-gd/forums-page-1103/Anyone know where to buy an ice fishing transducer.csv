Lowrance has let me know delaers that can order one but it seems that it will take about a month to get it.  If anyone knows where i can get one it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Smitty"

146117,Sinker,2007-12-28 20:45:00,8692,"I got a couple for my unit out of a bargain bin at CTC a couple weeks ago. No price on it, so I asked......they had no idea.....I  offered $10 for them, and they said sure  I picked up 2 for $10  Maybe check CT?  Summer/winter transducer is the same thing BTW. They both work the same.  Sinker"
146165,mbac31,2007-12-29 00:35:00,904,I have one of  the  Lowrance ones with the blue connectors. I'm not sure if it fits yours but you can have it if it does. It has the little bolt connector broken off so it doesnt fit a boat mount but would be great for ice fishing.
