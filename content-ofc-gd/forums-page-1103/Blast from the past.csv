145911,Rich Clemens,2007-12-28 01:12:00,3131,Hmmmmm 1972.   I would have been entering the 7th Grade.   Delivering the local paper for a handful of bucks a months and would have lost contact with my elementary school sweetie upon junior high.
145913,LeXXington,2007-12-28 01:16:00,1928,"Hummm 35 years ago, must have been hearing a Manchester United Match from my Mums tummy"
145981,Bernie,2007-12-28 04:12:00,3190,"A buddy sent me this on MSN.  TO ALL THE KIDS WHO SURVIVED the 1930s, 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's!!  First, we survived being born to mothers who smoked and/or drank while they were pregnant.  They took aspirin, ate blue cheese dressing, tuna from a can, and didn't get tested for diabetes.  Then after that trauma, we were put to sleep on our tummies in baby cribs covered with bright colored lead-based paints.  We had no childproof lids on medicine bottles, doors or cabinets and when we rode our bikes, we had no helmets. Not to mention the risks we took hitchhiking.  As infants & children , we would ride in cars with no car seats, booster seats, seat belts or air bags.  Riding in the back of a pick up on a warm day was always a special treat.  We drank water from the garden hose and NOT from a bottle.  We shared one soft drink with four friends, from one bottle and NO ONE  actually died from this.  We ate cupcakes, white bread and real butter and drank Kool-aid made with sugar, but we weren't overweight because, WE WERE ALWAYS OUTSIDE PLAYING!  We would leave home in the morning and play all day, as long as we were back when the streetlights came o n.  No one was able to reach us all day. And we were O.K .  We would spend hours building our go-carts out of scraps and then ride down the hill, only to find out we forgot the brakes. After running into the bushes a few times, we learned to solve the problem.  We did not have Playstations, Nintendo's, X-boxes, no video games at all, no 150 channels on cable, no video movies or DVD's, no surround-sound or CD's, no cell phones, no personal computers, no Internet or chat rooms........ WE HAD FRIENDS and we went outside and found t hem!  We fell out of trees, got cut, broke bones and teeth and there were no lawsuits from these accidents.  We ate worms and mud pies made from dirt, and the worms did not live in us forever.  We were given BB guns for our 10th birthdays, made up games with sticks and tennis balls and, although we were told it would happen, we did not put out very many eyes.  We rode bikes or walked to a friend's house and knocked on the door or rang the bell, or just walked in and talked to them!  Little League had tryouts and not everyone made the team. Those who didn't had to learn to deal with disappointment. Imagine that!!  The idea of a parent bailing us out if we broke the law was unheard of. They actually sided with the law!  These generations have produced some of the best risk-takers, problem solvers and inventors ever!  The past 50 years hav e been an explosion of innovation and new ideas. We had freedom, failure, success and responsibility, and we learned HOW TO DEAL WITH IT ALL!  If YOU are one of them, CONGRATULATIONS!"
145987,danc,2007-12-28 04:56:00,4677, What an excellent post. Thanks Bernie.

146029,Spiel,2007-12-28 13:52:00,9065," ....Oh boy that Angling Specialties catologue brings back memories. I used to wear mine out every year browsing through it, and ordering everything imaginable. From fly tying supplies to rod blanks and componenets. My first custom blank came form there. I remember it well, a 5' Fenwick glass spinning rod. The blank was yellow and had what was at the time refered to as a spigot ferrule, the first step away from the tradional metal types. Good times indeed."
146083,bigbuck,2007-12-28 18:56:00,2449,"I was just out of diapers and still remember my first Christmas gift from my parents, a big red plastic firetruck that I played with for eons."
146119,Tarzan's Jane,2007-12-28 20:50:00,1183,"I was a sweet 11 year old living in the country, jumping off garage roofs into huge piles of pine needles, playing hide n seek, spin the bottle (oh God please spin past him), stuffing socks in my bra, missing my little friend who was murdered and learning to stay away from boys who read 'dirty magazines'"

146466,pikehunter,2007-12-30 04:18:00,1659,Had one of my first cars and if memory serves correct I ruined a brand new pair of corduroy pants my mother had just given me for Christmas from leaking car battery acid.  Spent some of Christmas day at what was to become my future first wifes house. I should have opened my eyes and read all the signs that day   and ran for the hills!  If we only had insight into the future we would never make mistakes
146468,Tinman,2007-12-30 04:50:00,376,"I think part of that was a song, a country son more specifically some guy named bucky i think. Great tune!"
145724,danc,2007-12-27 16:19:00,4677,"On Christmas day, we had dinner at my parents house with the entire family. The designated smoking area for us die hards was in the basement. I was down there a couple of times during the visit. I found an old dresser that used to be in my bedroom many, many years ago, and started browsing through it. This is what I found inside. I don't know what happened to the Cabelas fishing catalogues. I probably wore them out. No wonder I never got in trouble when I was a kid.  "
145728,Greencoachdog,2007-12-27 16:31:00,8163,I think Austin Powers best described what I was doing 35 years ago:

145740,mistyriver1,2007-12-27 16:40:00,600,"73 or 74, I believe I was playing with my Evil Kenievel Stunt cycle (anybody remember those ??).  Dan, I can't recall if it was my birthday or Christmas, but I got my first rod and reel combo.  A Berkley Rod with a Garcia Mitchell 300 reel.  Remember the ones with the clicker that was really loud.  I still have the reel today."
145745,Beans,2007-12-27 16:55:00,3339,"1972...I was enjoying my first sober Christmas in many, many years...not fishing related but it wasn't long after then that I got back into fishing..."

I found a whole box of them (about 100) in the attic of a old house I rented in Guelph in 1979 (2nd yr University)... and that was one of them for sure ! Not sure what ever happened to them ... probably worth a couple bucks today  Anyhow Dan ... in '72 ... I was watching Phil Esposito chastising the Canadian fans for their booing in Montreal, Ken Dryden was standing on his head and a guy named Tretiak was making it realllly hard for Paul Henderson and the rest of us to kick some Red-Army butt....  Living in Brampton in the apartment buildings across the road from the Steinbergs and up the street from Billy Davis' house ... I still used my Popiel's pocket fisherman and my super-slider-snow-skates .... and ... if I am not mistaken ... it was the first year I had a plastic street-hockey-stick blade ... which when heated could hold a curve the size of Ethiopia !"
