146545,Mike the Pike,2007-12-30 18:13:00,3421,I have caught them in winter any where from 3 feet right up to 30 feet.They don't always hit the big minnows either.Sometimes the perch size minnow is all a Pike wants.Just remember to use a some tough line for Pike and don't forget to use a leader.  Good luck .Mike

I have taken one as deep as 50' at Roches point on a spreader meant for Whities. Some dangle live bait at one side of the hole (in a hut) while working a spoon next to it. Pike attracted by the spoon flash may hit the minnow instead. Smaller Pike will often rush right in all crazy like, while the bigguns' will often be spied sliding along beside the hole- checking things out!"
