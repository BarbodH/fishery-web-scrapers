146304,scuro,2007-12-29 19:07:00,386,What would you like to know? The lake is in the flat Hudson bay lowland. That makes for some unusual lake and river formations. Lotsa pike lotsa walleye. The water is stained a golden orange colour.
146400,ratherbefishing1,2007-12-29 23:57:00,2,We know that there is access to 4 other lakes...and river fishing... is it easy access? Do you know the average depth of Mikwam and the river? Is it worth exploring the other lakes? How's the cabin? {...more important to me than Bob   } Any info. would be great!
