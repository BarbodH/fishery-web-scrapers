Today i walked into Gangons looking for a pack of steelhead hooks and some leader line, want walked out with a shiny new Float reel! Yes, the 50 bucks my grampa gave me in gift card for my favourite store served me very well and ill be on the river tomorrow morning testing her out! Its a bronze Raven Matrix, and looks like it will handle the steel quite well. Ill post pics tomorrow of the reel and the fish  Im also posting this from my brand new laptop, santy sure was nice this year!"

Im heading to some bigger water than im used to tomorrow, so well see how it goes. I missed one good fish today, set the hook forgetting I was wearing gloves and the spool slipped from my  grip resulting in the crappeist hookset I have ever seen."
