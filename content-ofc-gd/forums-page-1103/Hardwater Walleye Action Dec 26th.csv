146059,PAZE,2007-12-28 16:47:00,132," How do you know a walleye that size taste like leather?? I guess by your coment is that YOU have killed one that size to say it tastes bad, or are you just posting for the hell of it? Do everybody a favour and keep your comments to yourself, because you are the one that sounds like an"

146064,salmon,2007-12-28 17:02:00,334, Nate Why are your posts so negative? From your other postings that I have seen from you are negative. This is not a FF.net site.  Nice eyes BTW
146066,Mike Pike,2007-12-28 17:08:00,1332,"Wow, what a great first outing!  You're gonna have a tough time topping that one, Grant.  Thanks for the post!"

146109,Shelley Cooper,2007-12-28 20:12:00,394,Excellent report and pic's... WTG guys...
146131,Nater,2007-12-28 21:45:00,68,"I forgot one big happy loving family here...  Paze, I don't eat fish but I can only imagine what an 11lb walleye that's been cruising a lake eating mercury and other toxins for years must taste like  As for your comment City fisher...sure it had nothing to do with a out of season trout report you posted and admitted to?...Nah couldn't have anything to do with that  Nate (runs to prepare for Team OFC tongue lashing)"
146134,TJQ,2007-12-28 22:16:00,7806,Very nice... well done.... no real fishing here till the first...  and toungue lashing... hey.. around here???  LOL
146551,Mike the Pike,2007-12-30 18:43:00,3421,Wow Grant now that is some set of eyes.What a way to make up for lack of fall Quinte walleye  
146554,Roy,2007-12-30 19:06:00,13728,You did a good job. Grant. Thanks again for the report.
146563,nelly,2007-12-30 19:57:00,256,Could it be possiible for a 10lb walleye from BOQ to be less than 10yrs of age? Maybe 7-8yrs because it's from lake Ontario where it has more food and grows quicker. Where as a 6+lb walleye from the kawartha might be older and has more toxic? Just curious to know.
145799,mcallister.grant,2007-12-27 20:02:00,327,"Hey all,  Here are a few pics from my first hardwater outing of the season. We fished on 3.5-5 inches of GOOD ice with real nice conditions. The highlight of our day came just before 5pm when my good friend nailed a 11lber. He had never caught a walleye like that so this entire trip was dedicated to him catching one. All in all we had a great day; landing 4 eyes, 1 pike and a bunch of jumbos. We also lost a tonne of fish as most of the time they were hitting on the way down and which didn't give us much time to set the hook before they spit it. Here are the pics.        "
145804,Roy,2007-12-27 20:14:00,13728,"Some very nice fish there, congrats to you both! Thanks for sharing."

145963,ccmtcanada,2007-12-28 03:19:00,7971,"Wow...what an incredible report!  Some great looking fish and judging from the smiles, a great day was had out there.  Great job!"
145970,Nater,2007-12-28 03:29:00,68,Why on earth would you kill an 11 lb walleye to eat?  I can go down to the store and season a nice peice of leather work boot if you'd like instead?  It would probably taste very similar  Nate
145976,mcallister.grant,2007-12-28 03:43:00,327,"Hey Nate,  I knew that issue was going to come up. The hole was not large enough so we were forced use a gaff. I am not very comfortable killing fish of that size nor do I condone it. Funny enough, I don't even eat fish. However, given the circumstances that were presented at that moment; I did not have any other alternative. I am very sorry if you found that offensive."
145978,buckster,2007-12-28 04:00:00,530,nice looking catch...dont let keeping that 11lber bother u.  You did what u had to do
146004,b2kptbo,2007-12-28 12:44:00,1505,A good outing and a beaut first catch for your buddy...

146013,Uncle Buck,2007-12-28 13:17:00,1000,Good Stuff Bud...  Good to see you guys wearing pfd's as well
146017,Smokey,2007-12-28 13:29:00,1278," Hey Grant don't ever worry about explaining yourself for keep a completly legal fish on here. No matter what you post someone will complain about it.  Great report and fish, and Thanks for posting the report.  Mike"
146045,bassman,2007-12-28 15:08:00,384,Thanks for the report. I find the big eyes taste just as good as the little ones.
146049,cityfisher,2007-12-28 15:46:00,959,great report ! .. thats a great bunch of fish ! If you need a partner one day gimme a shout !
146051,Nater,2007-12-28 15:57:00,68,"I suppose unhooking it at the hole was impossible?    people say oh don't let what others say bother you because you legally can keep walleye that size, yet when the guy killed a musky to eat they ripped his head off...  's  Nate"
146053,fishinggeek,2007-12-28 16:06:00,325,"I wouldn't have kept it either, but I agree with bassman that they taste as good.  Comparing it with shoe leather is a bit of an exaggeration IMO.  I always enjoy reading some of the rants here, like keeping fish or taking OOS pictures.  Thanks for keeping things interesting here!"
