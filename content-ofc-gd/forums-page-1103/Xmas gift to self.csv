145893,Garry2Rs,2007-12-28 00:24:00,1425,"Buck and I turned our boat over to a local canvas shop a few days ago to have a cover made. This was our Xmas gift to ourselves...the only fool proof way of getting what we really wanted...GRIN. Today we picked the boat up and were very pleased with the new cover.  It's fitted with a boot to go over the windshield and has a cut out for the trolling motor to come through.  The prop on the trolling motor is inside a heavy vinyl bag, to protect the outer matterial. There is a separate boot that covers the trolling motor and control cables.  Velcro around the openings in the main cover make for a snug fit. The whole thing is held on with metal twist loops, like the edges of a convertible top.   On my cross country trips I have destroyed two CTC/Wal-Mart type covers and two or three tarps. I decided to bite the bullet for a custom made cover and see how it stands up to the long drive.

145995,misfish,2007-12-28 10:27:00,29133,Nicely done bud.  The boat and trailer are looking a little dirty there    Time for a spit and shine.  Love the redneck look.No tailgate.
146020,Smokey,2007-12-28 13:33:00,1278,Looks like your all set for the trip home and it's only Dec.  Looks good and a great investment to keep the boat clean.
146112,Rattletrap2,2007-12-28 20:28:00,1652,Very nice Garry! I tow mine with a cover on and the biggest problem I have is keeping everything tight. The wind on the highway really takes a toll on the material if it starts to flap around. Maybe check into some extra straps for the long drive home.  I never got around to getting the summer cover off and the winter shelter on it. The last big snowfall did a little damage and I will get it in this spring for some repairs. I think I will get an alteration done to cover the trolling motor as well. I currently remove my Minn Kota Maxxum 65# with a slide on bracket. I'm getting too old to be lugging that thing on and off all the time!
