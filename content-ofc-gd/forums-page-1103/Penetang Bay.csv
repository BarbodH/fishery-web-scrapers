146423,Beans,2007-12-30 02:00:00,3339,While driving past the bay on our way to Maureen's for an early dinner I noticed about 20 or 30 huts all grouped close together on the north/west corner and open water on the south/west corner...What species would they be after out there ???
146425,AzuluSpookd,2007-12-30 02:07:00,348,"PIKE, PIKE AND LOTSA PIKE  I've fished it for many years, catch the odd good sized perch.....but mostly pike,"

I'm told that you can get Herring there and in Midland Bay, but the Herring apparently only stick around for a short while? and I don't think I have what they like, I understand they can be fussy    Tried it a couple of years ago and got nothing but a skunk  Maureen"

I've never caught any Herring in Penetang Bay, However....just around the corner in the much deeper water....Lake Trout grounds....that is where we've had luck catching the Herring. Hundreds of them just a foot or so under the ice....its quite an amazing site."
