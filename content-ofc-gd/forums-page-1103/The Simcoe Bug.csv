146120,irishfield,2007-12-28 20:53:00,26272,Ron put that post up a year ago... and edited it last weekend...maybe he needed the info somewhere else and borrowed it for now!
146122,Fang,2007-12-28 20:58:00,1330,  The ones he calls hand ties
146126,misfish,2007-12-28 21:20:00,29133,"Got a good laugh when he said ""they dont use them that much anymore"". The vertical jigs,well,I,ll stick with my mini meegs. They work awesome too.  Thanks Paul for the link."
146146,TOM C,2007-12-28 22:47:00,76,Does anyone make these for sale?
146239,Beans,2007-12-29 12:53:00,3339,Don't know if this has anything to do with the pics disappearing but I saw a couple of the Simcoe sites had requests for the bugs and the OFC site/Ron's thread was given in reply ???
146287,irishfield,2007-12-29 16:42:00,26272,Ron's ramping up production and going to have product sale booths... staffed with hot wimmins... at the end of all access roads to Lake Simcoe by April 1st..
146289,Terry,2007-12-29 16:52:00,14456,staffed with hot wimmins.....is that how you get the simcoe bug
146326,trapshooter,2007-12-29 20:20:00,1234, Depends if they're locals....  
10656,Ron,2006-12-10 22:13:00,1683,.
10658,misfish,2006-12-10 22:21:00,29133,"Ron the bug rules out here on Simcoe.Thanks for posting again.  If I may add,theres an old fella named George here in Barrie ,that made the bug famous.He still makes them at the age of 78 or something like that."
10660,Terry,2006-12-10 22:28:00,14456,"and if you don't want to make them Harry's Bait & Tackle in Keswick had them last winter so I would think, he will have them again this year"
10665,fishindevil,2006-12-10 22:51:00,6254,"thats very cool   and they work great,so do the berkley power magots,and the berkley power grubs,white & silver/green...."
10668,setomonkey,2006-12-10 23:01:00,872,"Thanks for posting this.  Neat jig, what species is it used for, and how do you fish it?  Mike"
10763,Ron,2006-12-11 02:11:00,1683,"These are mainly for Perch on Simcoe, however I have used them for Crappie as well. Drop em to the bottom, raise a foot and start erratic jigging. Sometimes raise quickly a couple of feet and pause... Just like any other type  of pattern, you have to experiment."
10769,Clampet,2006-12-11 02:20:00,1947,"Strange lookin' critter, The Simcoe Bug."
10803,huntervasili,2006-12-11 03:33:00,1604,Thanks for the post... might just have to tie a few of these guys up
10821,Fisherman,2006-12-11 04:21:00,7201,"Like Ron said, lower to bottom, jiggle an inch up, wait a second, jiggle another inch up, etc, after 10-12 inches lower back down.  It was a real frustrating time getting the hang of it, but they do work once you have the twitch mastered."
10825,Mike the Pike,2006-12-11 04:26:00,3421,looks like a candy thats been cooked on a hook.going to catch sweet perch
10832,wuchikubo,2006-12-11 05:07:00,1114,"Neat bug, I've never heard of it until now, I guess I'll have one more thing to ty before hitting the ice in Jan (if only the ice would form faster, hmm)."
10873,Harrison,2006-12-11 12:26:00,2202,Great tip to share Ron.  Thanks for taking the time to post it!
11075,Dano,2006-12-12 00:28:00,719,"Awesome post Ron, thanks for that. I plan on actually getting out to Simcoe for some ice fishing this winter."
11660,JFR,2006-12-13 14:18:00,498,"Ron, great looking bug.  Looks very easy to tye. What size and type of hook is used?  John"
11682,misfish,2006-12-13 15:04:00,29133,"Another tip,is you can use copper wire instead of the lead wieght."
11688,Terry,2006-12-13 15:18:00,14456,"you can use solder to, just wrap on"
11695,fishnsled,2006-12-13 15:39:00,3520,"Hey Ron,  Thanks for sharing!  These bugs certainly work last year.  Fishnsled"
11715,dwc67,2006-12-13 16:21:00,140,"thanks bud  you should have seen me in the craft store wanting thread in a ""buggy"" yellow"
146077,farmboy,2007-12-28 17:51:00,1,I WAS WONDERING IF THERE IS ANYWAY I COULD GET THE PICS AND DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO BUILD THESE THINGS....ME AND SOME BUDDIES ARE GETTING READY TO HEAD UP TO SIMCOE FOR FISHING AND LIKE TO GET THESE THINGS BUILT BEFORE WE GO
146084,keiths,2007-12-28 19:00:00,30,"Is there supposed to be a link on this thread? If so, I don't see it."
146087,ketchenany,2007-12-28 19:12:00,3229,Maybe us guys on MACs are shut out!!!!!!!!!! Hope Not
146095,Mike Pike,2007-12-28 19:29:00,1332,Nope. Nada showin' up on this pc either.
146102,motv8tr,2007-12-28 19:47:00,2587,"A picture would be appreciated as I don't get the video's being on dial up and all  Thanks, Maureen"
146104,Terry,2007-12-28 19:50:00,14456,"I would say he got tired of hosting his instructions and pictures, so every other website  around could view them"
146106,fishnsled,2007-12-28 19:53:00,3520, I think you're right Terry.
