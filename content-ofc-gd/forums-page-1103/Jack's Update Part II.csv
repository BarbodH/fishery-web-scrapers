146171,aplumma,2007-12-29 01:02:00,6896,glad to hear the good news and the slightly bad news. I had the ligaments in my labs back leg rebuilt and it was not a hard as the vet expected.  Art
146202,ChrisK,2007-12-29 03:27:00,2772,"Rick, Good to here Jack got threw his surgery and he's on the mend.  Cheers !!!"
145916,bigfish1965,2007-12-28 01:29:00,3382,Jacks surgery went about as expected. There was too much ligament damage to do the TPLO surgery. Instead it had to be done the old fashioned way (like they do on us mere humans) and stick and staple stuff back together. Unfortunately this takes his recovery time up to 8 to 16 weeks depending on how quiet I can keep him. The good news is that somehow he managed not to tear any meniscus/cartilage when he got hurt. This means he is much less likely to develop arthritis at an older age. He is going to be heavily sedated for a week at home to allow healing. Any wrong movement can re-tear the ligaments. He's not allowed up any stairs or allowed to jump up onto anything for quite awhile too. I've used up some vacation time to be with him over the next week or so so there will always be someone here for awhile. He may be home tomorrow and I'll put up some pictures if he is.  It's nice to be able to breathe again.
145918,Greencoachdog,2007-12-28 01:33:00,8163,Glad to hear he's gonna be ok Rick!  Now go to bed.
145919,Joey,2007-12-28 01:34:00,9122,That's great to hear Rick.  I thought about him all day.  Take a deep breath and have a beer or something and relax.  The hard part is over.  Enjoy your time together over the next couple of weeks and let us know his progress.  Joey
145933,Rich Clemens,2007-12-28 02:02:00,3131,"Good deal Rick.  Been hanging out waiting for an update.  Although the recovery time will be extended, it sure sounds like everything will be fine in the long run.  Developing arthristis is a concern I'll have for my girl following her surgery in a couple weeks.     Good to see you made it through the day as well."
145934,troutologist,2007-12-28 02:03:00,951,hope all turns out well. best wishes.

145950,walleyemen,2007-12-28 02:50:00,316,"Glad to here Jacks going to be o.k. Hard thing seeing your bud hurting, Iknow what ya mean about the meniscus tendon ,i'm having surjury on the 18th for my right knee, very painful."

145958,DebS,2007-12-28 03:02:00,56,"Rick, that's great news that Jack's surgery went well today - with so many good thoughts being sent your way, how could it not go well??? Glad to hear that you'll be able to spend some time close to your buddy - I know he'll enjoy having you around for sure! Just enjoy your down time with Jack & keep thinking positive thoughts. I'll keep you both in my thoughts. Here's to a speedy recovery for Jack! DebS"

145993,Big Cliff,2007-12-28 09:26:00,6899,"That's wonderful news Rick, looking forward to some pictures."
146001,JFR,2007-12-28 12:10:00,498,That is good news.  I know he is in good hands and look forward to the report that all is healed and he is back to his normal self.  John
146003,lew,2007-12-28 12:33:00,12767,"Thanks for the update Rick, we're all pulling for Jack's full & speedy recovery.  Marvin has  asked that you  please pass on his best wishes to Jack also   "
146023,motv8tr,2007-12-28 13:39:00,2587,"The hardest part is going to be keeping him calm and settled, he's not going to like that much ...any chance a sling can be fashioned so he is forced to keep weight off it?  at least from time to time?  Maureen"
146026,mistyriver1,2007-12-28 13:42:00,600,Hope his recovery goes well Rick.  Thanks for the update.
146038,fishless,2007-12-28 14:18:00,82,rick he will bounce back.don't forget the ramp outside to do his buisness our lab had the same problem but the tear not as bad good luck jamie
146039,Garyv,2007-12-28 14:24:00,547,"Dog recovery time and their ability to handle pain has always amazed me.  What would put a human away for weeks seem to only be days for them, unfortunately thats why you have to be so careful with their recovery.  Hard to keep them down so they do the medication for a week or so.  Just do your best and time will go by faster than you think."
146042,TJQ,2007-12-28 14:49:00,7806,"Glad to hear things worked out... a longer recovery time, but a recovery nonetheless!"
146046,Tarzan's Jane,2007-12-28 15:19:00,1183,Sorry to hear about Jack and all that has taken place.  Hopefully you won't get too worn down yourself.  Soon you'll be a single man again....gotta keep those grey hairs at bay.  lol     Wishing you the best with Jack and in your personal life.
146050,fishnsled,2007-12-28 15:47:00,3520,Thanks for the update Rick.  Here's to a speedy recovery!
