And days of auld lang syne, my dear,  And days of auld lang syne.  Should auld acquaintance be forgot,  And days of auld lang syne?    We twa hae run aboot the braes  And pu'd the gowans fine.  We've wandered mony a weary foot,  Sin' auld lang syne.  Sin' auld lang syne, my dear,  Sin' auld lang syne,  We've wandered mony a weary foot,  Sin' auld ang syne.   We twa hae sported i' the burn,  From morning sun till dine,  But seas between us braid hae roared  Sin' auld lang syne.   Sin' auld lang syne, my dear,  Sin' auld lang syne.  But seas between us braid hae roared  Sin' auld lang syne.    And ther's a hand, my trusty friend,  And gie's a hand o' thine;  We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet,  For auld lang syne.  For auld lang syne, my dear,  For auld lang syne,  We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet,  For auld lang syne."
