145612,Shelley Cooper,2007-12-27 00:22:00,394,"A belated Merry Christmas to all our OFC family members…. It’s been a busy time around our home, as I’m sure it has for many. I finally have a few minutes to myself.  I must have been a good girl this year; cause Santa was really good to me.  I got this Garmin 250w special edition GPS for my vehicle. No more getting lost for me.  And this Viper remote car starter.  Yes..No more running out in the cold to start my Jimmy..   This obusforme Drivers Seat will keep my back massaged, warm and comfortable.   I didn’t open any fishing gear this year, but I did get some gift certificates for BPS and CTC.    Along with a lot of other little goodies.  But the best gift of all, was having a house full of family and friends to celebrate.  BUT Its not over for us.. as the best gift of all is still to arrive. This is my daughter, with my granddaughter still cooking in the oven…   We will be leaving around 5am tomorrow morning, to Humber River Regional Hospital, in Toronto, to start the process to bring this NEW life into OUR world, and I get to help with it all  I can't think of a better way to finish off the Christmas season and start the New Year…  I hope everyone had a great Christmas  And  Happy New Year to you ALL…"

Mom and baby were kept a very close eye on for the first 12 hrs... blood pressure issues for mom and heart rate for baby... but as of last night, BOTH are doing quite well... and on the road to a great recovery and new life...  Kaylin and Shantayah...    Thank you to those whom have responded and kept us in their thoughts...  Best wishes to all for the New Year...  Shelley....  Now for some much needed rest..."
