146479,SlowPoke,2007-12-30 09:27:00,2984,"Nice trucks Z! I'd love to get into those... brings back memories circa 1978ish when I got a 4wd Jeep from Radio Shack. Pretty good rig for back in the day. I know if I got one I'd go nuts with it... did that with the slot cars about 15 yrs ago. By the way, who builds the models on the wall for you, Chip Foose? Some sweet customs there. -Brian "

146534,lew,2007-12-30 16:16:00,12767,"2Tone, here's a little 4"" diecast fire truck I played with as a kid back in the early 50's  I'd forgotten all about it many moons ago,  but then found it again about 40 years later under my parents front porch when I was doing some renovations for them. It was in rough shape after laying in the cold dirt for 40 odd years, but I cleaned it up and gave it some fresh paint and it now sits warm & dry in a curio cabinet with a bunch of other collectibles I have.  Fun memories  "

142205,Cast-Away,2007-12-13 02:53:00,790,"I've had an RC heli for a year now. This one is really challenging and my first bird, so I still have allot to learn.  "
142230,2 tone z71,2007-12-13 03:56:00,1311,Cast away how hard is that to handle thats my next RC
142232,discophish,2007-12-13 04:02:00,392,"I recently bought myself a Dragonfly heli.  Good thing I started with an electric bird, because if I had started off with a gas bird it would have been a costly crash   .  I wish my Jeep had remote control, it would be helpful when launching the boat on my own.  I will start planning that concept.  Should make me rich ... like Hasselhoff."
142256,silveradosheriff,2007-12-13 11:51:00,1025,Have a couple older RC 10s that the kids and I race around the ball diamond behind the house. These relics are incredibly durable and we have a blast with them!  :-)
142267,Cast-Away,2007-12-13 12:54:00,790,"2 tone, this bird is difficult to learn on as it is a stunt heli that can fly upside down. I read allot of RC boards first and most people were sorry that they bought a basic heli first because they mastered it so quickly that they got bored with it and moved up. It took me a month the learn to get if off the ground without crashing it.  Read more here: RC"

146057,largemouth,2007-12-28 16:32:00,112,"I was given a R-controlled ""VAMP BAT"" for Christmas and only had it airborne for about 7 minutes before a huge owl swooped down from nowhere grabbed it and flew away with my new toy in it's talons. I don't blame you if you don't believe me but its true and freaked me out totally."
146074,Hooked,2007-12-28 17:42:00,891,"Picked up a couple of those AirHog Heli's for my son this xmas, pretty cool.  I keep it interesting by chasing the cats with them and landing them on my ceiling fan.  But gonna pick this bad boy for my son, who is really getting into RC'n.  Starting him off with a Traxxas Stampede (electric).  Man, I can't believe how fast some of em go, 70+ mph, crazy.  But heres a pic of the one we are gonna get:  "
146094,Uncle Buck,2007-12-28 19:28:00,1000,"Electric is definitely the way to go in my opinion... clean and easy, useable indoors and no tuning required...  no performance difference interms of acrobatics or 3D flying in choppers when compared to nitro/gas units"
146145,2 tone z71,2007-12-28 22:44:00,1311,"HOOKED Ive got the Stampede brushless its crazy, I run the same batts I run on my EMAXX  and it moves great and lasts a very long time ,get your boy the emaxx I love mine 4 wd 2 speed tranny and fast and very durable ,ive also got a new Savage and its a great truck but finicky at times dammm nitro I like electric ,quite and fun"
146415,Hooked,2007-12-30 01:14:00,891,"  Hey 2 Tone Z71, is the EMAXX much more $ wise?  I know my son mentioned that one before.  BTW, where did you get yours?  My son found some sites where I was gonna order them from, not many hobby shops, or none that I could find, around my neck of the woods surprisingly.  Anyways, thanks for the heads up."
146441,2 tone z71,2007-12-30 03:16:00,1311,"the trucks are both mid $350.00 range its the Batts and charger that adds up,get a good set of Batterys they last 15-20 min on a charge,The ONLY place I would buy from now is Ideal Hobby in Barrie ,ask for Gaven Or Andy ,Gaven is the owner and they ship Postal ,I use to deal with Hobby Hobby but there cust service sucks,you can go wrong with electric ,the Emaxx is 4wd takes 2 7.2 volt batts has 2 motors AWESOME machine,the Stampede 2wd takes 1 batt is brushless and set up with the expensive lipo batt and proper gearing will run 65 MPH,I had it out yesterday in the snow ice its very agile,the emaxx will go almost anywhere it will climb stairs in low gear,good luck and let me know what you end up getting,ill post some pics of the trucks in a few minutes"
