146481,Joey,2007-12-30 09:54:00,9122,See you's all out there.  Looks like its going to be a great day.  Joey
146482,drwxr,2007-12-30 10:17:00,453,"i have a question about simcoe, never fished there before but planing a trip in couple of days, is the bottom that weedy throughout the whole lake or only close to shore ?"
146542,Fisherman,2007-12-30 17:33:00,7201,"No, not weedy everywhere, just random areas, of course more so in shallower water."
146130,Terry,2007-12-28 21:40:00,14456,"another trip to cooks bay this time on the gilford side, I decided to walk, leave the atv at home till I see the conditions first hand.. I had to park about a km away from the lake, so I needed to take a break by the time I reached the lake..LOL today there was a layer of snow on the ice, so cleats were not needed  you could buy minnows right on the lake, I decided to try with out them  I walked out quite a ways,cut some holes put down the fishfinder and the camera and the two rods lots of people fishing no one catching so I went deeper,  drilled a bunch more holes with the hand auger found there were lots of weeds on bottom I caught lots of fish but only kept about 10 that were the right size  most people were doing a lot of moving...that tells me not many were catching fish  went about 35 minutes without see any fish on the camera and without a bite, so I moved to one more spot, but found no perch called it a day and prepared for the long walk in....I guess it's good exercise my legs were sore my arms are sore, no pain no gain...  as I walked along the side of the road I noticed lots of cars and trucks had tickets, wrong side of the road..ticket parked to close to an intersection..ticket and a few I couldn't tell what they did wrong..a ticket  I was glad to see my truck did not have a yellow piece of paper on it's windshield a good day playing on the ice..now where can I go next.... with the ATV       <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3210.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3210.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>            <object width=""425"" height=""355""><param name=""movie"" value=""       the underwater video is from last year same place if you haven't seen it check it out     <object width=""425"" height=""355""><param name=""movie"" value="""
146132,Greencoachdog,2007-12-28 21:48:00,8163,"WHITE BUCKET!!!  Great report, pics, and vids Terry!!! Glad you got fish and didn't get a ticket."
146133,Dondorfish,2007-12-28 21:56:00,1000,So Terry - Whata ya think - ice ready for atv travel?   Don
146135,Terry,2007-12-28 22:17:00,14456,"I wouldn't want to travel the whole bay, but you bet is riding time"
146136,Mark Kulik,2007-12-28 22:19:00,348,"WTG Terry, at least you got out-I will wait till next week to take my little guy's out."
146137,misfish,2007-12-28 22:19:00,29133,"Nice report bud. I would of stopped for a rest aswell,well maybe,maybe not,but you got out.Nice job.  Maybe I need to click my heels together and wish ""I NEED TO GO FISHING,I NEED TO GO FISHING"",,,,,,,,,,,,Nope,it aint working.  I know of two fellas and a las,that are heading for eyes and crappies,ya might want to contact them."
146178,tbayboy,2007-12-29 01:28:00,1497,"Nice stuff Terry, that video was great - looks like there were a fair bit of guys out there which hopefully means the ice is pretty safe (I'm way too much of an ice rookie to push it when its iffy).  Didn't get out on the ice during the christmas break in Thunder Bay this week so I'm twitching to get out after reading this."
146183,irishfield,2007-12-29 01:31:00,26272,Can you do a video in the other direction next... so I can unwind?  Looked like a good day out there Bud. A Km walk TO THE ICE eh... sounds like a valee service could do well there.
146209,Joey,2007-12-29 04:00:00,9122,Thanks for the report Terry.  I think I might need to venture out there this weekend  Joey
146213,tapout,2007-12-29 04:26:00,166,"hey joey,  Me and Icefisherman  are heading to gilford this sunday morning.  Care to meet us there? Haven't seen you and Tybo in a couple years.  I went to Virginia Beach today and did ok on the perch.  I landed about 55 to 60 and kept about 30."
146242,Terry,2007-12-29 13:17:00,14456,"sunday, I might be out there too"
146288,Photoz,2007-12-29 16:47:00,792,
146302,Shelley Cooper,2007-12-29 18:16:00,394,Nice report and pics... Love the video....  Good to see you got out...I'm still feeling a little nervous about the ice conditions with the crazy weather we've been having...  Thanks for sharing.....
146315,Fisherman,2007-12-29 19:56:00,7201,"Come on Shelley, don't be a nervous nelly, hitch Chuck up to the portable and go fish. Just make sure you have something for traction, there are some slippery areas."
146316,irishfield,2007-12-29 19:59:00,26272,With the Gale out of the South last night and this morning... is the ice up to Orillia yet? and boats back in at Gilford? LOL
146327,mistyjr1,2007-12-29 20:21:00,97,"Great report Terry, can't wait to get out sometime next week.   I will never forget it. Seeing the people rushing in to get there cars.    Corey"
146337,misfish,2007-12-29 20:45:00,29133,  I believe theres a bussiness for a float plane taxi here. Wayne.what ya think? $$$$$$$$$
146379,Fisherman,2007-12-29 22:36:00,7201,"I would highly doubt that poking a bunch of holes in the ""parking lot"" had anything to do whatsoever with the parking lot sinking.  More than likely was the fact that everyone was parked so close together on ice which was unable to support that amount of weight.  There was a similar incident about 3-4 years ago at Lefroy, parked far too close together and when the ""final straw"" parked, all went under.  Matter of fact another dimwit that drove on with trailer and hut last year went through at Gilford, no holes were made for him."
146402,Joey,2007-12-30 00:01:00,9122,"Hey Tapout, just saw this now.  I think we'll head out there tomorrow morning.  Whereabouts you gonna be?  Terry, do you think its snowmobile worthy or should we walk it?  Thanks guys.  Joey"
146411,Greencoachdog,2007-12-30 00:45:00,8163, Do you have a PFD for your snowmobile Joey?  Remember to take lotsa pics please!
146420,tapout,2007-12-30 01:49:00,166,"hey Joey,  We haven't decided on any particular spot yet.  I tried calling you but it keeps telling me the call cannot be completed as dialled.  Send me an email with your number and I'll call you and we can arrange somewhere along the way to meet. I'm thinking the Timmies at the 400 service station."
146432,Terry,2007-12-30 02:42:00,14456,"I am taking my atv, so yeah should be fine to go out as far enough to get fish  so, do you guys have a radio, portable  marine or gmrs I am not sure what time I will be out but a blue atv and a big yellow bag on it"
146436,PERCHER,2007-12-30 03:10:00,787,Fishindevil and myself will be heading out of Gilford Sunday morning maybe we will see you guys out there.
146456,Dondorfish,2007-12-30 03:34:00,1000,Myself and Skeeter will be there also - sounds like the making of a mini M&G   Don
146465,Mike the Pike,2007-12-30 04:01:00,3421,"Thanks for the report Terry makes up for the lack of fish today for me. Thanks for playing the video again I did enjoy it last year.  My new camera only views but I really like the new toy its so Kewl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
