We spent 2 hrs looking for aggressive perch finally after running and gunning fishing approx 20 holes, we found them. Ice was solid 5-8"" and the perch were hungry. Kept 21 and released at lease that many again. She lost a super huge jumbo right at the hole, had a good look at it and it was by far the largest perch I've seen, around 15"". The two fish in my hand are 12"" to give ya some perspective as to size. Had a great day out and an interesting drive home, snow squalls, ice marbles, wet snow and finally rain. Hoping to get up there again soon.  "
