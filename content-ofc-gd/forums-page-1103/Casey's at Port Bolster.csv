146040,Bob,2007-12-28 14:28:00,370,I'm sorry to hear he's no longer with us.  I hadn't seen him in a long time but I've thought about him now and again over the years.  The thought always brought a smile or a chuckle.  We fished and partied together and did some crazy things.  I won't forget him either.
