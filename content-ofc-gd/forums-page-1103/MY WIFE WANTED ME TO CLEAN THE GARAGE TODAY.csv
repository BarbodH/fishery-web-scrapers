Well i wondered over to bass pro shops with $350 worth of gift cards as a reward for one of the companies i sell for instead of doing the garage.    This is what I came home with.  A new tackle box and spinning rod with a whole bunch of lures, plastics etc...... to help fill the new box up.  Got home and my super cool wife was almost done the garage! Then I had her help me organize my tackle box.  What a woman!  I think i will keep her for a little while longer!  Cheers!"

You've got a keeper that's for sure...LOL.  If I did that, Bly would have been ticked I went to Bass Pro without her...haha.  Great haul of gear there...thanks for the pic."
145974,Ramble,2007-12-28 03:37:00,713,Nice Mepps...and those lindy fish gloves could come in useful. They saved my fingers twice last summer....but they take a long time to dry out i find...and you're lucky she cleaned that garage without you THEN helped you organise the tackle box. My g/f just complains....just this morning she was complining cause she had to work and couldnt go ice fishing with me lol  Enjoy your haul  -Ramble
