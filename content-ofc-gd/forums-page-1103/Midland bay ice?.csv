146284,irishfield,2007-12-29 16:38:00,26272,"Been frozen for a long time. I'd have to look back for my post and pics I took on the day it froze over for a date. Sat at the f-in-laws on Christmas Eve, on the water front between Midland and Penetang Harbours, and it's frozen in every direction as far as you can see. I have no reports on ice thickness though, and haven't been into Midland to see if anyone is out there....but if you call Brian and ask him if he has bait for sale and if he knows how thick the bay is.. I'm sure he'll let you know.  Backwater Tackle = 705-527-7351  1-800-675-4071"

146293,irishfield,2007-12-29 17:06:00,26272,Yah they tend to F it up just when it's getting good. Guess we need another load of grain...boats not there and it usually does spend the winter.
