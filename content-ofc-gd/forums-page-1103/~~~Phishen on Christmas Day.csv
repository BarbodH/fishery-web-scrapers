Headed out to an area I've phished before and Slug got the Mexicam auger going and we found we had 3"" of frozen slush, and 6"" of black ice over 28' FOW. Right off the bat ""phish on"" problem it was a week early  back down he went, about 5min. later the Perch moved in and were hitting hard, Slug tried to release this one with out me seeing  Then finally the phish we came for hit about 1.5' off the bottom    Ended the day 5 walleyes released till New Years Day, 24  Perch, and 1 Crappie.  Chasen Lakers this Sat. if anyone wants us, will be at the Norland Tackle Shop between 7:30 and 8:00"
