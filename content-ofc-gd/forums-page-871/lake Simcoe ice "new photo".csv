325943,misfish,2009-04-03 20:41:00,29133," Yep.  I have a partner,lets get it going.Right now.No time like the present.   With all the fog off the lake today,I couldnt see poop out there.After this weekend,the Lord should be pretty much brought down to his winter knees."
325947,digitalkreation,2009-04-03 21:00:00,25," Hey Bill,  I'll be up on Goucester this Summer in my first boat, what's good in there and when?  Best, Mark"
326065,crappieperchhunter,2009-04-04 03:17:00,2582,Move on! No crappie in the Kawartha's.
326072,misfish,2009-04-04 03:55:00,29133, Heard the same thing from a local.Must be true.
324513,Terry,2009-03-31 19:31:00,14456,"well, I think one more good rain or if it's good and windy in about 2 days and we can say good by to the ice on simcoe well most of the ice as it will be pushed to one side of the lake here is what it looks like today could be fishing Virginia beach already "
324525,tinbanger,2009-03-31 20:19:00,1028,Can't wait  Drove by Tiffen launch today and there was people swimming  Turns out it was Geogian Collge students in survival suits !   TB

324585,Cudz,2009-03-31 22:21:00,2652,looks at the poor people in Beaverton.  They get crushed by ice every year.
324595,steelhedrmatt,2009-03-31 22:48:00,278,I was fishing the bottom end of cooks on Saturday in the boat
324597,tjsa,2009-03-31 22:52:00,1578,"Still a month of good ice for us up here in Northwestern Ontario. After the beautiful weekend we just had up here, we are now getting pummeled by another late winter snowstorm."
324603,misfish,2009-03-31 23:05:00,29133, Thats great news Tom.Santa will be so happy.LOL   Tought you meant that drunken fool from the weekend Dave.LOL
324605,Terry,2009-03-31 23:08:00,14456,"as much as I would love to be still icefishing, you can keep the cold and snow up there...LOL  steelhedrmatt, nice to see people are getting out on cooks in a boat some years back I was on cooks this time of year and the wind direction changed pushing the ice back down the bay stranding and my boat far away from where I put the boat in......always an adventure"
324620,douG,2009-03-31 23:36:00,2693,"Terry is hardcore, keeps pushing the normally accepted normal norms.  The Envelope, as it were."
324632,tinbanger,2009-03-31 23:52:00,1028," My inlaws have a cottage at Brechin that gets pummeled by ice every 10 years or so . Happened two yearS go , hopefully they get spared.  TB"
324670,Skud,2009-04-01 01:05:00,739,It would have been fun to have fished for pike today at the river mouth in Cooks.
324699,Mike the Pike,2009-04-01 02:23:00,3421,What altitude did you jump out of that plane?
324897,fishnsled,2009-04-01 15:07:00,3520, Sounds familiar.  I had the same thing happen up in the narrows. Nice and open in the morning running across the bay up into Couch.  Came back and the bay was full of ice.  Only took an hour to bust through the ice to get back to the launch.  Normally about 5 minutes.
325482,Terry,2009-04-02 22:22:00,14456,getting better every day balsam looking good too   
325495,Beans,2009-04-02 22:40:00,3339,"I had to take a run down to P'Boro this afternoon...went down via Bobcaygeon and up via Chemong Road to Bridgenorth and Buckhorn...  Pigeon is still frozen over at the north end but open mid lake to the bottom... Chemong, upper and lower Buckhorns and Gannon's Narrows all appeared open from the roads...  Stopped down at our park and got out to take a look...our lagoon where we dock our boats is still half filled with ice and Tait's Bay is loosening up along the shoreline so another week should see it all gone...this is real early...I hope the crappies are not all finished and gone by opening up here 25th April (3 weeks)   :dunno:"
325497,Terry,2009-04-02 22:42:00,14456,yeah that could be a problem....crappie fishing  does gets harder as the lake warms up
325503,buckster,2009-04-02 23:02:00,530,  should be prime for opener...... Give that water a little time to warm up for us!
325512,Beans,2009-04-02 23:22:00,3339,  What ???...Musky opener ???
325554,buckster,2009-04-03 00:52:00,530,  No no for crappie...... i have never caught any so i wanna give it a try this season!
325594,Governator,2009-04-03 02:13:00,879,"This is what she looks like right now, snapped it with my cell - Kempenfelt Bay around 6pm (Shot from south side looking northeast):  "
