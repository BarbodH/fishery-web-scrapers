I'd like to go after channel cats in the Welland river if I can but I'm not sure of any decent locations.  Alternatively, I'd try the Niagara for Steelhead but I think it would be jammed on weekends.  Also, it poured rain today so water clarity could be affected tomorrow?  Anyways, appreciate any areas you good folk might suggest.  Cheers,  MoB"

On my way out to Wellandport I realized how close I was to Dunnville so checked that out too.  Tried the dam then further south but nothin doin.  It was a tough day, cold and windy - but it was my first fish of '09 - so worth every minute.  Thanks again for the help.  Tight lines.  MoB"
