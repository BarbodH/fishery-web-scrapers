Im sure a few have done what im about to take on here.within this forum. Pictures would definetly help of previous projects. Thanks guys and gals. Cheers!"

I think I read on here something about the new type of pressure treated reacting with aluminum because it has copper in it but don't quote me on it. Hopefully someone can clarify this. I wonder if staining regular lumber with an exterior stain would solve that problem, if that's the case."

325692,StylinCatch,2009-04-03 06:36:00,43,I took a picture and small video clip of a boat I had seen in Temagami this year. I particularly like the way this one was done. Great job done fosure. 
325723,bushart,2009-04-03 12:30:00,2628,Years ago I put a casting deck on my 16 ft lund.  If your using plywood as I did --get a large piece of cardboard and trace and trim/trim trim the shape of the section of boat your covering.  I used aluminum angle for the sides between seats to take the bounce out of it---way above water line---used aluminum hammer rivets.  The problem I see with your picture  is no storage door cut into to stow stuff in that front area below your floor--battery etc.  Bushart

325879,StylinCatch,2009-04-03 18:28:00,43,I've made sure I took that into consideration.
