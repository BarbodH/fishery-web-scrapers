325273,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-02 06:23:00,270,Comments and restrictions in this area....does anyone know of?    I and my nephew were going to fish there this Sunday! Any concerns I should have or maybe a link to some regulations Any help would be great!
325361,CLofchik,2009-04-02 14:58:00,854,"Hamilton?  The only concerns should be lack of fish & over abundance of goose poo! Nice place for a picnic, but the fishing isn't exactly stellar."
325378,Mike Pike,2009-04-02 15:55:00,1332,"I love 'da Point' too.  Great place for a walk and jog, etc.  Now, Cootes Paridise used to be a voluntary no-fishing area.  The RBG wanted game fish that migrated throught the area to have a chance to do their thing.  I'm wondering if this is still the case.  Perhaps someone can chime in.  In the mean time, why not take your carp gear and hike along the trail to the carp barrier( about 10 minutes or so )and go under the highlevel bridge and try for some carp on the Hamilton Harbour side.  They're there and they are BIG!  Goodluck!"
325379,hammercarp,2009-04-02 15:57:00,964,I think you would be better off at Bayfront. There's perch and crappy there and free parking.
325383,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-02 16:09:00,270,thanks for your replies....I feel like I should let PAradise point alone.....Bayfront sounds like the place or try the carp barrier ..........It is so beautiful at princess point ... so many options Thanks again!
325386,Marko,2009-04-02 16:15:00,854,"This carp barrier that you guys are talking about, is that at Desjardinis park??"
325390,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-02 16:20:00,270,    you know the walk-around well theres a path that runs over to west hamilton under the train bridge..the barrier is near there I think?
325426,bdox,2009-04-02 18:42:00,329,"You could also try Cemetery Point, a little off the beaten path. Should be able to land some bullhead and channel cat there. If you drop by Bills Bait and Tackle on Upper James, Greg or Tim should be able to tell you what's hitting and where."
325677,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-03 04:23:00,270,  cool I will swing by Bills bait they also have their line re-spool special 1 cent per meter this weekend!
325990,Baptiste,2009-04-03 23:27:00,37,"It sounds like an interesting spot, you might want to bring the heavy tackle.  SOMETHING IN THE WATER AS BIG AS A CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! « 1 2 » ( hope the Link works)"
