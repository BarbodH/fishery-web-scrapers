We started trolling, and after about twenty minutes I get freight train of a hit, and after a few jumps, it gets off.  For the next 90 minutes we plugged away without even a sniff.  Finally, at about 7 00, we established a pattern.  We anchored off of a deep rocky point, and casted into the shallow water.  In total, we went 4 for 7 on trout, and 5 chunky OOS smallmouth as a nice added bonus.  Slower than the last trip, but at least we got into some fish.  An average size fish for the day.   The biggest trout of the trip, that I'd estimate to be around 6 pounds.     All fish were released."

325582,Leecher,2009-04-03 01:47:00,7832,Great report and pics Joeytier  You guys got into some nice browns.... that second one sure is a bigun Congratulations to both of you and thanks for sharing Leechman
325786,ehg,2009-04-03 14:53:00,2666,Some nice browns there.   You must have been the only boat out there.
325825,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-04-03 16:06:00,1362,Beauty Browns!!....I can hardly wait to get out!!
325833,Walleye Hunter,2009-04-03 16:13:00,8,"WOW, what a fish that 2nd one is.  Nice to see.  Great to finally be getting out eh?  Long winter.  Thanks for the post."
325919,JoshS,2009-04-03 19:52:00,729,Yes!  I'm loving these Lake O brown reports.  Goodstuff!
325924,Fisherpete,2009-04-03 19:58:00,1814,"Nice fish! Is your GPS unit mounted to your paddle??? If so, that is AWESOME lol!"
325935,douG,2009-04-03 20:24:00,2693,"Gorgeous browns, joeytier.  Thanks."
325936,Joeytier,2009-04-03 20:26:00,3990,"Haha.  Yes, it is.  There's also a set of holes drilled across the paddle as well for baits.  It really doesn't serve as a paddle at all, since it's screwed right into the boat."
325949,irishfield,2009-04-03 21:06:00,26272,Great stuff Joey... the father / son time! The fish are just a nice bonus...
325974,msp,2009-04-03 22:41:00,1336,You make me want to quit my job. Nice Browns. Nice lid too.
325977,Joeytier,2009-04-03 22:48:00,3990,"There was one that left quite a bit before us.  I swear I've never caught them the same way twice in a row before.  I've fished that place two days in a row many times, and NEVER has the same technique been equally as effective both days.  Browns are crazy fish."
325980,trapshooter,2009-04-03 22:57:00,1234,"Well done, some very nice browns there."
326003,Cudz,2009-04-03 23:58:00,2652,Nice fish. indeed.  I want to catch some of those.
326037,snag,2009-04-04 01:43:00,1932,Good on ya!  
326256,Zubris21,2009-04-04 17:36:00,563,Great report.  I love the pattern on those Browns.  IMO they do not get enough attention for such a beautiful fish.  I would love to get one some day!
