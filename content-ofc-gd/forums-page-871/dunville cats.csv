324385,MJL,2009-03-31 13:14:00,2427,Those are huge  I've never purposely tried fishing for them.  I normally get them by accident when I'm carp fishing.  I'd definitely love to hook into fish of that size.  Well done
324517,NAC,2009-03-31 19:52:00,369," That's one of the strangest requests I've heard in a while. Excuse my ignorance for not knowing how things work down there, but if these fellas tried to pay and you weren't open, then why would you expect them to go back after if the entrance allowed them in?  It would seem more reasonable to keep the entrance closed until business hours start, if it is pay per useage.  Nice fish Pure."
324518,purekgw,2009-03-31 19:55:00,585,i paid for parking in the box in the 24/7 bait store and we rang the bell at like 7

326417,scugpg,2009-04-05 02:13:00,1373,"Wow great catches! I'd like to try my luck on the Thames. Aside from sucker meat, what else do you guys have luck with? I saw a post about shrimp & garlic a while back,wondering if that would be as effective"

323822,timmeh,2009-03-29 23:30:00,609,"Dang I was fishing in that exact spot with the same set up and bait on friday and got skunked. No fish were caught between the 15 people there all day so I guess i picked the wrong day to try.  Anyhow nice fish, that second one looks like a beast."

Pure, was the bite more in the morning or steady all day?  I made up some cat bait and going to give it a shot some time this week."

324344,smokin joe,2009-03-31 09:49:00,226,I've always found that the BIG Cats want to stay on the bottom and they will let you know that!!  Once you get them off of it they will dig hard to get back there.
324348,b2kptbo,2009-03-31 11:08:00,1505,"Some good weight to those Cats, good work..."
