326522,huey graphite,2009-04-05 13:46:00,362,Had planned to be fishing the Queenston drift this morning for my first time and was very much looking forward to it. Have fished from shore on a number of occasions but never from boat. Drove down yesterday to have a look at the conditions to find it was full of ice flows. Plan B to fish Port Dalhousie so I head there to check the water there. Water was like chocolate milk which was no surprise thanks to Friday's rain. No one fishing from shore or boat.  Any idea how long it might take for the water clarity to improve?  P.S. stopped at Peter's Tackle and found some great deals. Rapala line ranging from 6-25lb test on for $2 a box
