325667,nautifish,2009-04-03 03:49:00,1416,"Well after getting back from LPB this avo and working the cart for a few hrs......Man OH man....  Today was a beautiful day  My youngest Sheldon came to help his mom today...   We packed her in around 2,00pm and headed home to find both my work shop and the hall plus the basement all flooded...... When i got home i had unloaded the van and got the Boat motor & gas tank in the back along with our rods tackle and so on.......Not expecting to find a firkin flood downstairs....So spent two hrs cleaning up that mess....Sinns got home basically turned everything off...I currently have no water....Felt so bad for my lad Ricky he worked 11 hrs today (Jodie's lawn care) and was black when he came in & the poor lad could not even shower....I felt awefull......So got a guy coming in the morning to fix it..... So i said sod this lets go fishing so a fishing we went.  We took the boat for A QUICK SPIN OUT ON THE LAKE...WOW was it ever warm and the sun was still beating down on us...  After a spin out on the lake we decided to head back in & fish the creek. The channel and creek are just loaded with minnows right now they were jumping every where.  Saw a few big fish jump too.  Anyway we fished out near the yacht club and i got into my 1st little channel cat of the night.  He was released when i had another hit and sure enough another little channel cat.   Sinns did have something on his line but he lost it....  So a little later on we decided to move further down into the creek as the wind was picking up a little so we found shelter where there was less wind.  Not even five minutes of having my line in and Bam big hit.....New this one was a good size..... I think by this time sinns was getting pi shed at me cuz he had not yet caught a fish...lol  Here she is and what a beautiful looking channel cat.    It was starting to get dark pretty quick once the sun went down and we were ready to leave when i get another hit.  This time a little bullhead..... So in all even though it was a crappy day had a great evening out on the water fishing kitty cats.....  Hoping to get out again tomorrow evening.  And last but not least cannot forget to post some pretty pictures i took this evening... ;D   "
