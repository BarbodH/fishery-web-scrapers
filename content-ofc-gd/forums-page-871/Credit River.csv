325821,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-03 15:58:00,0,with the rain we're havin...It'll be mud!
325824,justin elia,2009-04-03 16:05:00,151,Wait about a week or so.  We've got about 25mm so far today and the rain isn't close to being done.
325827,BillM,2009-04-03 16:09:00,17367,"It's going to be blown, along with every other eastern trib.  Stay home."
325828,Walleye Hunter,2009-04-03 16:09:00,8,"Yes, Our rain has been on and off.  I may have to do some work around the house if everywhere is getting this.  Never enough days off in a week."
325860,setomonkey,2009-04-03 17:18:00,872,"Might not have to wait a week, I remember from an old thread here that the tribs vary in how long they take to clear after heavy rains. Some are blown for at least a week and others start to clear up after only a couple of days.  Can try doing a search to see if you can find it, or go take a look yourself (the best option) if you have time...  Mike"
325866,justin elia,2009-04-03 17:34:00,151,"You'll have to wait around a week for the Credit, but Mike is correct, some tribs tend to clear sooner than others."
