For the most part, fish have seen just about every presentation but this is when you put those under-utilized colours to work. Fish below hit a Olive Marabou steelhead jig after refusing several other drifted jig colours. Sometimes you just have to bring it all.....no wonder my vest is so heavy. Cheers. "
325678,douG,2009-04-03 04:24:00,2693,That's why they call them rainbows.  A beautiful fish for sure.
325735,Leecher,2009-04-03 12:52:00,7832,Great report and pic silverstreak  Beauty bow for sure!!! Leechman
325753,kennyman,2009-04-03 13:42:00,737,"That sure is a ""purdy"" chromer. Down in Brantford we still have to wait a few weeks more.  I'm still learning. Can you tell us more about your rig and/or technique?"
325776,dheitzner,2009-04-03 14:41:00,314,"Great report and pics Jim, I'm sure everyone appreciates the tips as well. Definately liking the Riverworms, but can't find the dark pink colour. Any suggestions? Darcy"
325796,BillM,2009-04-03 15:08:00,17367,"You should use that pic for some Riverwood advertising, would make a good pamphlet photo.  Nice fish, great colours."

325837,msp,2009-04-03 16:26:00,1336,"Nice steely ya got there. Olive is an ""underutalized colour"" ??????????? Olive is the best colour."
325962,silverstreak,2009-04-03 21:55:00,146,Real easy Kennyman.......Just fish jigs under a float same as you would roe etc. The real key to floatfishing success is to be in the strikezone.During colder temps or faster flowing rivers -  steelies will seek out depth so your presentation should be close to bottom. In warmer temps and slower flows fish will suspend off bottom. Hope this helps. 
325967,Joeytier,2009-04-03 22:14:00,3990,Nice report.
