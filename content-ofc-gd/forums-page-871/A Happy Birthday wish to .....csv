I've just got a few things to get out of the way in the office then I'm outty.  The boat is staying in the garage but I'm going to throw on my shimano rainsuit and hit a couple shore spots for pike.  I'll report back later!  Thanks for the b-day shout outs guys! - maybe my boy will be born tonight?!?! Junior has a nice ring to it...  Cheers, Ryan"

I'm ""working"" albeit not very hard, at all 4 events! Dave's wife's birthday is the same day as mine, so I guess it's for the both of us - AND OFC member Bly as well!  Cheers, Ryan"
