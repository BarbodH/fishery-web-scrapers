On the foot pedal, there is the option for momentary or constant prop.  Is this option still available when using the co-pilot or do you have to constantly hold down the prop button to make it work?  Thanks."

So if your boat is not more than 18 feet just run the foot pedal to the back and use it. I set it on the seat and even adjust it with my hand, works great."
326400,motion,2009-04-05 01:26:00,403,I have had my co-pilot on my 18 ft Alumacraft for a couple of years. I love the unit. I have the remote mounted on my rod with the controls at my finger tips. You can do everything with the remote that your foot pedal does. I think its well worth the investment. Great little device. Cheers.
