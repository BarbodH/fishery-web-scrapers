325648,fishboy,2009-04-03 03:04:00,550,I'd be curious tohear to-never been there myself but it's close by.
325651,ld17,2009-04-03 03:09:00,319,I've read some reports that guys have been trolling in the area and are doing ok.  From the looks of the reports their not that far off from shore.  Good idea would be to go to Grimsby tackle and ask them for some info.  I'm sure they could help you out.
325666,huey graphite,2009-04-03 03:47:00,362,"Curious to know myself. I live within walking distance and with the wife and daughter in Florida, have time to finally do some fishing.  Unfortunately I've had very little success out of 50 point for the past few years and all reports I've read say it is nothing like it was a few years back. If you go, I wish you better luck than I've had......(it's probably just me  )"

325874,beertech,2009-04-03 18:07:00,118,Just a tip guys. Fifty point is very expensive if your launching a boat.  You can launch at forans marine just down the road for allot cheaper
