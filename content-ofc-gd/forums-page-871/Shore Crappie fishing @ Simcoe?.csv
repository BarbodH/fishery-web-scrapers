326148,codered,2009-04-04 12:49:00,123,I was out friday in the rain and caught nothing I think i got wetter than the fish... the river (bradford) was high and muddy... im going to try again on sunday ..
326171,Beans,2009-04-04 14:17:00,3339,Remember guys...there is a daily limit of 30 crappies on a sport licence in zone 16...COs are checking at Bradford so I heard...(10 only on a conservation)
326173,KelfuN,2009-04-04 14:18:00,246,i read from another thread that there's no fish in Simcoe.... i dont know why your going to bother going there
326175,okumasheffield,2009-04-04 14:36:00,318,"Thanks for the reminder but I am not planning to keep anything  Going to use the steelheading's spirit to fish for Crappie, ha  Does the muddy water affect fishing for crappie or not really?"
326252,bassjnkie,2009-04-04 17:26:00,1101,"My favorite spot I went to Sat and Sun, was packed with crappie and perch and the waters had no visibility. I caught mostly crappie on Sunday, many were very good size for this time of the year. Then I went back every night this week, with very few crappie caught. If your headed to Brad, I would hold off for a bit, a buddy called me this morning he said they haven't come in yet, but a couple small ones were caught from a boat."
