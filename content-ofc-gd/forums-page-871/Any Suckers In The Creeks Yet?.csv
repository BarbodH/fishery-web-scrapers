325478,SNAGKING,2009-04-02 22:16:00,43,I heard reports of some being caught but I think it's still a little early before large numbers start showing up.

325504,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-02 23:03:00,3761,"Just took a walk down to the creek and it's not as dirty as i thought...maybe i'll be out there saunday fishing! Also after walking a .5km stretch of creek i saw in the current just before a slow moving pool 2 or 3 fish lined up...so i left them be, i'm guessing they were trout,  but there is some instinktive to get me out there this weekend!"
325513,richyb,2009-04-02 23:24:00,774,   That was likely your suckers
325520,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-02 23:46:00,3761," You think so, they were fairly dark fish and there was just the 3 of them in a line...Either way i just know there fish!"
325620,Victor,2009-04-03 02:39:00,1609,"I was out last saturday and people have been catching them, they're defintely not in thick yet when I was there but some has came up already."
325622,Joeytier,2009-04-03 02:42:00,3990,There's plenty of suckers on the creek
325710,chickenhawk,2009-04-03 11:28:00,612,lots of suckers in the creeks down here
325729,kemper,2009-04-03 12:43:00,2232,"there was some in last weekend  I didnt catch any but the guy ""fishing"" near me with a 13 foot searcher lead in a 5 foot deep hole caught lots"
325750,JohnF,2009-04-03 13:36:00,3494,  But are they catching anything?  JF
325767,Walleye Hunter,2009-04-03 14:19:00,8,"I was on Bowmanville and caught a couple on Tuesday.   Still early, but some are in.  Trout seem to have already gone up.  Oshawa will be fairly similar."
325771,fishermccann,2009-04-03 14:28:00,655,I have been catching suckers on the Rouge River for 2 weeks now. Some nice 3 pounders.
325856,l2p,2009-04-03 17:07:00,346,"^^ co sign, some fatter ones in there too   soon boys soon..."
325884,StylinCatch,2009-04-03 18:34:00,43,"Suckers will be swimming here (North bay) shorlty aswell if they are not already running, will have to check next time im out."
325920,chukkk,2009-04-03 19:54:00,57,What bait is good for Suckers ?
325925,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-03 19:59:00,3761,"Ah great rain...meaing high fast moving dirty water....looks like i'll be out fishing some time next week i guess, unless the creek goes down a bit!  As for bait for suckers, use something in a calm pool...like a worm on a jig or some gulp."
325932,fishermccann,2009-04-03 20:21:00,655,Worms!!!
