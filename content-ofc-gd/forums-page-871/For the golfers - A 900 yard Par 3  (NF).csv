325545,JohnF,2009-04-03 00:42:00,3494, Jeez. I have trouble with 150 yarders.  JF
325559,JEREMY,2009-04-03 01:00:00,300,Pebble beach has nothing on that hole.
325584,Leecher,2009-04-03 01:56:00,7832,Tiger woods would only use a wedge on that one
325897,lucabrasi,2009-04-03 18:56:00,114,"That's an insane hole. I'd hate to be in the rough  I wonder if anybody can shed some light on this, it just might help my game some. When courses post distances, is it a visual line to the green, or does the distance take contours into account as though you were walking to the green?"
325910,GBW,2009-04-03 19:21:00,8460,good courses mark it up the mid. of the fairway.  those same good courses mark the sprinkler heads to mid. green.  the better ones have GPS and or everything is marked (ie sprinkler head has yds to front/mid/back).  so a 340 yard dogleg might only be 280 to the green and that's when you have the green light to grip it and rip it!
