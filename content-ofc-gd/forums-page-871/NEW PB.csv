325894,highdrifter,2009-04-03 18:48:00,2534, Give a hoot?  Read a book.
325896,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-03 18:54:00,0,read enough to know what constitutes being a parasite...
325907,highdrifter,2009-04-03 19:15:00,2534," That's wonderful GB.  Then you'd know that brook lamprey feed on diatoms and protozoans...  By the by, a parasite isn't necessarily a sucker."
325908,misfish,2009-04-03 19:15:00,29133," I didnt read a book,but did do some reading up.  Northern Brook Lamprey    Features: The Northern Brook Lamprey (Ichthyomyzon fossor) has the characteristic features of lampreys -- a round mouth and teeth arranged in a circle -- but this species is non- parasitic and the larvae feed on diatoms and protozoans. This species is small (9-16 cm long) and is easily confused with other native lampreys. As indicated by its common name, this species lives in small rivers. Adults spawn in gravelly riffles and then die. Individuals can lay over 1,000 eggs. When the larvae (called ammocoetes) hatch they make burrows in soft mud and spend six years growing. Then they metamorphose into an immature adult stage which lasts over winter (about 8 months) and then they develop sexual maturity quickly, emerge from the mud and disperse as adults to the spawning grounds. Adults never feed and live for about a year before dying.  Status: Special Concern Provincially and Nationally  Range: The Northern Brook Lamprey lives in the eastern United States in the upper Mississippi and southern Hudson Bay drainages, ranging from Manitoba and the Great Lakes region south to Missouri, east to the St. Lawrence River. In Ontario, it lives in rivers draining into Lakes Superior, Huron and Erie, and in the Ottawa and St. Lawrence Rivers.  Threats: The Northern Brook Lamprey prefers warm water and it may never have been common here. Ontario populations have declined because of the application of non-selective chemicals in streams to control the introduced Sea Lamprey, which is a parasitic species and a threat to Great Lakes fisheries. The species persists in untreated streams, above barriers and in backwater areas, which are not affected by the treatments. Water drawdowns and siltation are also potential threats.   Good ol Andy.LOL"

325918,musky66,2009-04-03 19:47:00,273,They are parasitic and feed by sucking fluids out of trout and salmon by attaching to them with their sucker mouth and rows of teeth.  They almost decimated the fisheries in the great lakes many years back. Much money has ben and will be spent to control their numbers.
325922,misfish,2009-04-03 19:55:00,29133, I havent posted a RED X in many moons.LOL  
325926,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-04-03 20:09:00,0,"Speaking of lampreys, wanna have some fun, those things spawn after trout in may/june in shallow rocky streams, they line up in pairs males and females, you try to sneak up behind them and with the white cotton gloves you use to tail steelhead, you reach down and try to catch them before they see you. the best creeks to do this on are also the best ones for trout. Honest its really exiting, plus your doing the trout a big favour, they will thankyou with many memorable days of double digit steelhead.   By the way that sure is a biggun"

326131,OhioFisherman,2009-04-04 11:17:00,6623,"Many years ago fishing from shore in Lake Erie with a neighbor and his dad in Cleveland his dad caught a sheephead. It had a lamprey attached to it on the soft flesh under the gill plate, also seem catfish with marks on them from lamprey usually right where the head ends.  We killed that one, I have no feelings of guilt over it. Never had an issue with killing a gobie, though bait would have been a better plan if legal  Got to watch the history, plenty of blame to spread around on why some species are no longer common sights in the great lakes and elsewhere, most of it human activities.  Dad used to tell m of sturgeon being thrown on shore and left for dead when he was young, people thought they were ugly.  Commercial netters here in Ohio would never take any responsibility for diminished walleye populations. Always claimed that they weren`t taking enough to harm the population, blamed it all on pollution. But within a few years of their licenses being bought by the state and commercial walleye netting being banned Lake Erie was full of them.  Also heard stories of lamprey being the cause of lake trout disappearing, but after seeing some of the fishery abuses and the blame game played who knows for sure. Still don`t like them, not a big fan of sheephead and carp either."

325496,ozaibak1,2009-04-02 22:41:00,401,"Yeah I was reading a few years ago how lampreys were / are a delicacy in China for hundreds of years. But do a google search on 'lamprey eating' and you'll see sites that say they taste even better than lake eel! Wouldn't mind catchin one myself, although I don't know if I could get myself to clean it, I have trouble with catfish as it is."
325528,4thgen,2009-04-03 00:10:00,157,"So you killed a native species because it feeds on introduced species?  Although there is still some debate, sea lampreys are probably native to Lake Ontario (St. Lawrence), but made it into the other great lakes via the Welland canal after improvements were made around 1920, causing some impact on the fisheries. The only reason that they had an impact was because the numbers of lake trout were so depressed from commercial fishing.  Oh, and killing one would do nothing to help the problem anyway, it's just killing for the sake of killing."
325542,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-04-03 00:37:00,0," Lamprey made it in to the great lakes in the 1800's. And I don't believe that ""the only reason they had an impact was ..."" is factual either.  At present we have reduced lamprey populations by 90% and you still see scars/wounds/live lamprey on a staggering amount of great lakes salmonids.  I've worked with lamprey but I do not condone the mistreatment of any animal.  Taking it out of the water might be acceptable, but slowly torturing any animal is unethical, and doesn't demonstrate much respect for nature."
325578,rob v,2009-04-03 01:33:00,535,Than do it ethically- slice off it's head/sucker - quick kill.  job done.

325588,BillM,2009-04-03 02:03:00,17367,Are we actually having a debate about killing lampreys?  I wouldn't stomp it into the ground either but I wouldn't feel bad at all about slicing it's head off..

325591,4thgen,2009-04-03 02:10:00,157," Although they may have had an impact otherwise, the overfishing certainly magnified them. There is new data suggesting that they entered Lake Ontario after the last glaciation. --check this out: http://www.sgnis.org/publicat/waldgrun.htm Mitochondrial DNA Analysis Indicates Sea Lampreys Are Indigenous to Lake Ontario -- it's just an abstract but you get the idea."

325861,xeon,2009-04-03 17:19:00,350,"Ya uhh, make sure to watch out for the other species of lamprey in Ontario, such as the Silver, Chestnut, and Northern Brook that are native to the areas theyre in. I know that the brook lamprey is a species of special concern, so you probably dont want to stop on them.  And are you people kidding me about leaving sea lampreys alone? Like seriously? If it wernt for control on them, your rainbow trout that your catching this time of the year in great lakes tribitaries would be a thing of the past. Lake trout pops in the great lakes are ruined because of them.  Great Lakes Fishery Commision http://www.glfc.org/lampcon.php  Im actually kind of irritated people dont know anything about sea lamprey."
325869,anders,2009-04-03 17:58:00,1168,"Hey Xeon,  Dont get to worked up about it.  Me along with at least 1 other person on this board have and still are treating great lakes tributaries for adult and larval lamprey. What i noticed from travelling across Ontario, NY, and MI, is that not too many people actually worry about them. Sometimes we get the good for you, good job spiel and sometimes we get lambasted for killing, and harming the fish and ecosystems...some people go out of there way to try to help and even learn and spread knowledge of them, some don't care.  Lots of times its just lack of knowledge with the species and the destruction that can be caused from them.  Remember the crash the Lake Trout populations happened in the mid 1900's when people were just born or not even around, so they havent seen the effects that they can cause, and only lately have commercial and sport fisherman started to see the rebound.  The problem is still under the water and not really in our faces....out of sight...out of mind for lots of people."
325878,highdrifter,2009-04-03 18:23:00,2534," I don't think any of those lamprey are parasitic, and are only found in areas where substrate(they burry themselves in it) and water quality permit..  so no need to worry about finding one of them stuck to a steelie..  I'm also pretty sure that lake trout populations were more affected by habitat degredation and over-fishing..  but hey, that's just my .02.."
325882,anders,2009-04-03 18:32:00,1168," You are right about lots of those lamprey and not feeding on fish, mostly filter feed on the bottom.  They may hitch a ride, but would not take down a fish.  However, it was well documented that the lamprey invasion was a major cause of the crash of the trout...not saying that over fishing did affect it...just added to the already crashing populations.  Just a tidbit....an adult lamprey when an adult, can kill 40 or more lbs of fish."
325885,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-03 18:35:00,0,  Huh...must have been a brown I caught......    Not to mention that every Salmon we pulled in last year had an eel atttached to it......

325487,ozaibak1,2009-04-02 22:31:00,401,"Quick question. Why does someone who posted a picture of a pike a few weeks ago with some dirt on it get flamed for improper / imperfect handling, but no condescending remarks about treating another creature of the water (this one) like dirt? Because they look ugly? Sure they're an invasive species but shouldn't they be treated with a bit of respect? It's like when humans say one species / race is more superior to others. I think all fish should be respected and treated equally.  Not to say I haven't been guilty of flinging a sunfish or not handling it with care, and I'm not criticizing anyone here, and Kemper I'm not criticizing you on how you handled it either, and hope it's not taken that way, just wondering what gives. Does a rarer catch like a muskie deserve to be so holy, with ppl getting flamed the hell out of if it hasn't been treated like a queen in a picture? All fish should be treated equally in my book (ideally).  Hope I don't get flamed for this, not my intention to stir the pot just interested to know why certain fish are the second coming of the messiah, while others are hell spawn. Just looks? How rare they are? Eels from what I've heard are quite tasty btw!  I'm not saying don't kill them, but don't let them suffer either! Takem out with a quick blow"
325490,bigfish1965,2009-04-02 22:34:00,3382,They are very harmful and I believe you are supposed to kill them. It was a rule at one point but not sure if it is still.
