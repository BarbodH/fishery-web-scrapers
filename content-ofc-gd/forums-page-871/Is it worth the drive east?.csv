326363,Bassnbows,2009-04-04 23:57:00,58,Has anyone been out East lately. I think most of the fish flew through the last couple days. Might take the drive is worth it?
326365,HTHM,2009-04-04 23:59:00,4082,I think the Atlantic still has some fish in it....

326381,ADB,2009-04-05 00:30:00,444,Good question.  I've been toying with the idea of going out myself.
326385,mikeh,2009-04-05 00:32:00,824,does anybody have the webpage showing the water flow levels in the rivers? this is a great tool to find out if the rivers will be fishable.
326386,mikeh,2009-04-05 00:39:00,824,here is the page for water levels you can change it to whatever one you want water flow
