374607,BUSTER,2009-08-20 19:02:00,1336,"Funny , i was going to rip off my own trailer also? let us know what insurance gives ya? It is the perfect time of year to do that since nobody wants to spend money on a boat, seasons almost over, and heck i need x-mas cash!"

I was thinking of a ""boot"" like they use for cars but the ones I've seen so far are fairly expensive.  ,,, Ummm ...sorry to hear your boat was stolen....  however,.... u say above that you think the ""boot"" is fairly expensive???  Is that in relation to the 75 horse merc u lost...the boat... the rods... or the trailer ???   As a ""boatless"" guy myself..(.because I don't own one yet) I don't understand why you wouldn't have that kind of investment secured in some format while sitting in your driveway??"
374680,pro190,2009-08-20 22:43:00,13," I agree... if they are determined, then there isn't much that is going to stop them.   I live in a new development and thought I was immune to this happening ... live and learn, no place is 100% safe.   I like the idea of a DVR system... will also help keep an eye on the annoying door knockers too.  I've got a coupler lock and a GPS tracking unit ready for the next boat I get once insurance settles."
374684,pro190,2009-08-20 22:48:00,13,"  Ya, I have insurance so no worries there... just sucks at the timing.  Have a September fishing trip planned and losing the boat now puts a dent in the plans.  Need to rethink the trip."
374719,TC1OZ,2009-08-20 23:50:00,987, That must suck! If I had a boat I'd offer to take you out! hahaha....  My free boat plans fell through...hopefully I can find a good deal while I'm up in Parry Sound!
374818,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-21 12:20:00,1022,"I used to use a coupler lock on my trailer, but I find I can BARELY get it off. I have to put a cloth or something under the latch how much force is required to open it. and I'm strong like bull too  ."

374966,danbo,2009-08-21 18:54:00,2646,"HOW TO INSTALL A HOME SECURITY SYSTEM WHEN ON A BUDGET:  1. Go to a second-hand store and buy a pair of men's used work boots, size 14-16 - or larger.  2. Place them on your front porch, along with several empty beer cans, a copy of Guns & Ammo magazine and several NRA magazines.  3. Put a few giant dog dishes next to the boots and magazines.  4. Leave a note on your door that reads: 'Hey Bubba, Big Jim, Duke and Slim, I went to the gun shop for more ammunition. Back in an hour. Don't mess with the pit bulls - they attacked the mailman this morning and messed him up real bad.  I don't think Killer took part in it, but it was hard to tell from all the blood.  P.S. - I locked all four of 'em in the house. Better wait outside.'  INSTALLATION COMPLETE!!!! Thanks for using the  Redneck Security Company"

374295,danbo,2009-08-19 23:07:00,2646,Outdoor Video Camera.. Hopefully the creeps are found. Ask neighbors if they saw anything too.
374303,dave524,2009-08-19 23:21:00,4508,"A lot of trailers have those white spoked rims, maybe a couple of feet of hardened chain through the spokes and around the frame of the trailer with good keyed alike locks wouldn't be very expensive but somewhat effective."
374304,Radnine,2009-08-19 23:29:00,1538,Sorry to hear about your boat brother. I put a lockable ball thingy in the ball thing. I also put a chain through the rim and around the frame as was previously mentioned. I also fold the trailer tongue back and use the safety chains to lock it in the folded position. What precautions had you in place if you don't mind my asking? Jim
374305,danbouck,2009-08-19 23:31:00,4380,That sucks! I just use a lock on the tongue. Maybe i'll get some chain!
374306,Greencoachdog,2009-08-19 23:34:00,8163,One of these will slow them down:  http://www.etrailer.com/pc-L~3774DAT.htm   ... but the very best deterrent is one of these!    A well trained guard dog is worth it's weight in gold!!!... even little yappy dogs that make a lot of noise will scare off the thieves.
374308,danbo,2009-08-19 23:37:00,2646,Cops know you cannot stop a determined THIEF! They must have scoped it out for awhile. Maybe a neighbor is a scout for 'em? My best bud got robbed with a pair of jetskis on a trailer. They broke into his house too!!!!!! Lots of INSURANCE + photos of your gear + registered SERIAL Numbers is your only help. Motion Detector lights & Video is BEST. Any lock can be beat by a pro..

374334,smally21,2009-08-20 00:21:00,993,"we sold several locks at our trailer shop, the sturdiest lookin one was called a gorilla lock at around 40$.  CT sells tongue locks cheaper but this thing was beefy!  chain thru the tires is a good low tech deterrent (funny story my partner towed a 26' for 5kms before figuring out the black strip down the highway and the blue smoke was not normal). some other ideas we came up with -long term storage or a week left at strange boat ramp - remove the bolts and take the coupler with you! -most of our boats trailers were huge and had pipe mount jacks, lower the trailer as low as you can onto a block and take the jack with you! kind of a hassle but in both cases would be thieves would have brought devices to conquer a lock but unlikely to have brought a spare coupler or jack sorry to hear about your troubles hope the replacement goes well!"
374338,Greencoachdog,2009-08-20 00:33:00,8163,"  Great suggestions!!!  A 12"" diameter hole 4' deep with a #6 rebar hairpin puored in concrete and a heavy hardenened chain run thru it and around the axle takes some time to get thru too!  ... especially if there's a couple rabid dogs trying to chew your nads off!!!"

374349,bigugli,2009-08-20 00:49:00,6138,"I had a ball lock and a chain through the frame anchored deep in the pad.  It""s only a deterrent, and to show proof to the insurance dinks that we had done due diligence.  Amazing how many insurance companies refuse claims on that basis."

374564,Canuck2fan,2009-08-20 17:09:00,1444,"Sorry about the boat being stolen.... The truth is these days if the thieves want it bad enough they will get it one way or another. Locks only slow down the honest person.   GCD I have never seen a dog yet that couldn't be tricked somehow, with food a bigger dog, a female in heat.... Or if the item is valuable enough the dog is drugged or shot for it. Remember thieves aren't thieves because they have a strong sense of morality to begin with.  I agree with a camera system to help catch them but just having it go into your house isn't enough because if the item is valuable enough what is to stop them from coming in and getting the computer, discs or tapes? Especially if you happen to be out which is when most thieves like to do their dirty deeds.  I am sure we aren't too far away from a system with facial recognition that would upload the crime automatically to the net where the thief would be unable to stop it..."
