I am looking at targeting Rainbows, Steelhead and or salmon, on either fly fishing or float fishing, any help as to what my opptions are would be greatly appriciated.  I can rent a car so that is not a problem but it would have to be day trips as the wife will be with me as she is the reason why we would be going as she will be attending seminars so all I have to do is pay for my flight as the room will be payed for.  Help please!!  Thank you,  FLEX"

I am just starting my search as thiswas presented to me only this morining and with the vast knowledge on this board I came here first.  FLEX"
374493,bill smy,2009-08-20 14:19:00,31,I always fish there every summer.  Lots of lakes with rainbows that are wery well stocked and easley caught.  Check out websites like gofishbc.com or stuff like that.  Dont bother with steelheading as you have to buy a 60$ stamp as well as an expensive licence.  Check out the local tackle and fly shops to see whats happening.
374495,bill smy,2009-08-20 14:22:00,31,Oh!!! the cowichan is a river of heaven!!!!!
374500,FLEX ROD,2009-08-20 14:43:00,394,"  Please tell me more.  What would the fishing be like and what could I expect at that time of year, I do not mind the cost of of the tag and licence.   FLEX"

375251,scuro2,2009-08-22 13:53:00,904,Steelhead would be coming in. Have you thought about Sturgeon? It might be one of the best times. Don't know a lot about BC fishing but found this discussion board in the past helpful. http://www.bcfishingreports.com/
375255,Sinker,2009-08-22 14:10:00,8692,"Yep, if your going to BC, you gotta fish for the sturgeon in the Fraser!! Oct. is a really good time of year for the giants!! I went in the spring and had a blast!!  If you need more info, shoot me a pm.  S."
