374669,Jonny,2009-08-20 22:11:00,1380," Well that's good then. Your topic was worthwhile... and not only for you.   Yep. Myself, I prefer a combination of the two. I love catching fish (and releasing them) but I don't tend to short-change myself on fish for the table. My family and I like eating fish too much.   I guess it's more of a ""big fish don't taste as good"" thing. I must not be that discriminating because I can't really tell any  difference between 1 lb pickerel and 5 lb pickerel once the fillets have been battered or breaded, and fried. You'll have to decide for yourself, as you say."
375252,scuro2,2009-08-22 13:58:00,904,"I always throw the big fish back. Would only consider keeping one if it was a world record, and I might very well throw that back too. I've only ever keep fish for that night's meal, and at that, it would a few smaller ones then a big one. The meat is better on small ones and there is less toxin build up in several small fish then one larger fish. I take no issue if others want to keep large fish or keep their limit everyday."
375317,bigfish1965,2009-08-22 19:48:00,3382,"It is difficult to argue with success. We have seen improvements in most lakes and in lakes like Nippissing that now face more pressure than ever before with sustainable  populations. Given the pressure on Nippissing that is quite an accomplishment. My experience with big walleyes is different because of where I live. A 6 pound walleye is an average fish on Lake O. I, however, would not eat one because of the possible toxins and because I am still weary of this area of the lake and its ability to maintain the population. The Niagara to T.O. stretch of Lake Ontario has seen a huge return of walleye and it didn't really happen till after the slots were put in place. Coincidence?? I don't know. But I am not going to take the chance and miss getting another 17 pounder. The one in my avatar is 16...right out of Lake O and others have had many similar experiences. So far there has been a general unwritten consensus amongst those who know where these fish are that all fish that can be returned will be until we have an idea on the population and the level of toxins in these fish. Personally I think we have a great mix of sport and food fishers. There is nothing wrong with taking home fish to eat and we have all at least come to the point that we understand it is a finite resource and we have to be responsible. It is a learning curve for all of us and civil discussions like this help to further the cause. I commend and applaud all you guys in this thread for being civil and respectful...thank you!"

373877,Lunker777,2009-08-18 20:40:00,866, hahah Thanks for the heads up !  I personally don't eat fish. I couldn't imagine what a 4# largie out of rondeau bay.... in 80 degree water temps would taste like. Probably not something I would care for !  All my fish live to see another day !
373879,LeXXington,2009-08-18 20:44:00,1928,"Perchy and Walleye  Actually, from some of the reports coming out, people need too keep more ""small"" fish as without enough top preditors the small fish do more damage competeing for food.  Send the big ones back, unless its hurt or going belly up.  Now if I can only catch a fish"
373918,ch312,2009-08-18 23:12:00,1590," this is something i have never understood. people always say that you must release big fish because they have ""good genetics"". you cant look at a fish and say that it has good genetics just because it was lucky and grew into a trophy. maybe that trophy fish you caught had ""bad"" genetics and took 2x longer to grow to that size than a normal fish would. maybe these ""good"" genetics causes some fish to grow quicker than they should be resulting in other abnormalities.  id say any fish can grow to be a trophy if it is LUCKY enough to avoid predators (man)."
373932,Jonny,2009-08-18 23:47:00,1380," Not that I can speak from experience as far as largemouth are concerned, but habitat doesn't always equal poor eating. If that were the case, pork wouldn't appear in all the 'smoked food porn' we've seen lately.  I would guess that the flavour of the meat in a largemouth bass has more to do with what it eats than the temperature of the water it inhabits. There are other warm-water species that taste great, including many from tropical-temp  salt water.  The other thing to consider is that what we call swamp water is often very clean, clear and well-filtered because of all the vegetation."
373975,Burning Babies,2009-08-19 01:05:00,150," The science doesn't agree with you guys.  On an individual scale, sure, a deformed, learning disabled fish could by chance make it through to trophy size.  But from a fisheries management standpoint, across the thousands of fish making up a lake's population, the vast majority of big fish will share certain characteristics.  Growing fast has a lot of advantages in the fish world (ability to consume larger prey, move faster to escape predators, carry more eggs); the biggest force selecting against big fish is man.  Big fish don't get big by chance alone, any more than big people get big by chance.  Just off the top of my head, Texas's ""Share a Lunker"" program is a good example of a management program that is trying to improve the genetic stock of a set of lakes to produce bigger fish."
374079,bigfish1965,2009-08-19 06:46:00,3382," Its not just that either. These fish have shown disease resistance, have encountered all type of water and weather variations and survived. Those are the genetic traits you want to pass on. Disease resistance and the ability to adapt to changes are the keystones to a successful fishery coupled with the characteristics BB named... camouflage, predation, speed and size."
374100,Radnine,2009-08-19 12:36:00,1538,Rebuttal Jocko???
374148,Jonny,2009-08-19 14:42:00,1380," None, of course. I never said I disagree with the science.  Keep in mind all the things we have in place to protect the breeding population and the population as a whole - closed seasons, fish sactuaries, minimum sizes, slot limits, etc.  I focus on pickerel, and Nipissing pickerel to be even more specific. They provide a good example - as the premier sport fish, the most heavily pressured by both sport and non-sport fisheries, on a lake which is very popular for fishermen in both summer and winter.  The slot limit for anglers is meant to protect the prime breeders - vigorous fish, fully mature, which have years of protected growth and spawning within the slot. That makes perfect sense. To be able to keep small, under-slot fish, and an occasional fish over the slot, also makes sense.  The thing that complicates the whole picture is that there is a non-sport fishery on the lake that takes pickerel of any size, and accounts for 2/3 of the total yearly catch (40,000 kg of an estimated 60,000 kg yearly). Many of the fish which are caught and released by anglers end up in nets, to be processed and sold.  If you go to the Chief Commanda I, dry-docked at the North Bay wharf, you will see mounds of pickerel fillets for sale in glass-fronted butcher's coolers. The fillets are large, and it's easy to see that most of them would come from fish that are in the slot.  Yet the pickerel population, with the protections it has, is deemed by the MNR to be healthy, though under pressure, and on the rise.  If a sport fisherman is lucky enough to occasionally tag a 6 lb pickerel, and he decides to make it table fare, then I say no harm/no foul; he's doing what he's allowed to do, and what the science (upon which the slot limit is based) says is OK.  I don't get this idea of trying to make a fisherman, who faithfully follows all the regs, feel guilty for occasionally keeping a larg(er) fish. Chances are he's already released a lot of protected prime breeders within the slot.  If I catch a 6 lb pickerel, and I have no other pickerel on the chain or at home, chances are I will keep it. If I already have other pickerel for a nice dinner, I will let it go. My judgement call.  That fish has already spawned and passed on its genes many times. And yes, a 6 lb pickerel from Nipissing tastes damned good.  Judging from other anglers I have met and have known over the years, my attitude is pretty standard. However on this board (silent majority notwithstanding) I sense a different culture, and to be frank I think a significant portion of it comes from people being reluctant to say that they will occasionally catch and keep larger fish. Well I'm not reluctant to say so.  I should start a poll (I might  ) just to see what the results are. But I think I already know what they would be."
374169,hoot33,2009-08-19 15:47:00,93,its rare for me to catch a big one but I throw everything back regardless of size.
374200,angrypigeon,2009-08-19 17:31:00,31," this is a common thought for conservation-minded fishermen.  don't mean to single you out, shore_lunch.  but would it be better to harvest one larger fish rather than keep 3-4 smaller ones?  in this way, you're only taking one life, and you give the more fish a better chance at growing larger.  i am advocating keeping one 3lb bass over three 1lb bass."
374281,bhearsum,2009-08-19 22:05:00,11,I should've know where this thread would go.
374339,Jonny,2009-08-20 00:36:00,1380," For the most part a very civil discussion. I don't see the harm.  So, since you presented the topic originally, has it helped you establish your own perspective?"
374345,danbouck,2009-08-20 00:45:00,4380," They count for his daily limit but he can ""gift"" them and get another limit the next day, so I've heard."
374411,Burning Babies,2009-08-20 03:52:00,150," Mortality rates for bass are usually around 50%.  It typically takes northern bass around three years to reach a pound, and several times that to reach 3 lbs.  Therefore, it doesn't make sense to remove a large fish to give a few small ones the slim change of replacing it.  Couple that with the fact than in many reasonably pressured systems, one pounders outnumber three pounders by a factor of 10 or more, and I don't think that argument makes sense.  edit:  That's not to say that I have a problem with people keeping the occasional large fish.  I think that harvesting fish, including occasional trophies, is an important historical component of the sport.  Just don't kid yourself into thinking that taking big ones is likely to benefit the fishery."
374440,singingdog,2009-08-20 11:28:00,1047,"Let me be clear: I am not accusing the guy of poaching. What I am saying is there is a disconnect between his behaviour of 1)always keeping the largest fish, and 2)his complaint that the quality of fishing is not what it used to be.  I see it all the time. Recently I spoke with a guy that had kept what he thought was an 8 lb LM bass (more likely a 6 lb, but even that is huge for this area). In the next 5 minutes he is lamenting the lack of big fish. ""Lots of 2 lb bass, but it's getting harder all the time to catch a big one."" Doh!  The three 1 lb bass mentioned earlier might grow up to be lunkers. The 3 lb bass is already very far along that road. Throw it back today and try to catch it again next season."
374530,EC1,2009-08-20 16:04:00,930,"Has anyone else also noticed that fish are the best looking when they are still alive? When they're dead, colours fade and they just don't look as nice anymore.  But on the other hand, I like my fish, will eat them out of the freezer, and I WILL take the occaisional big fish home."
374534,Jonny,2009-08-20 16:09:00,1380, True enough.

374576,tdotfisherman,2009-08-20 17:32:00,317,"I always throw the big ones back.. and I usually throw almost every fish back. Each year I only keep a couple fish.. and usually the ones I keep are Northern Pike that have taken the hooks too deep, and can't be released. The way I figure, the more fish that I let go, the more fish there will be for me and others to catch in the future."
374585,Jonny,2009-08-20 17:50:00,1380," But every big fish you keep saves a lot of other little fishies.  The most dramatic thing I ever heard was when I was touring a pickerel-hatching operation near Port Loring.  The guys running it said that in one of their rearing ponds, which is usually good for thousands of fish, one year they emptied it and got only a few ""monster"" (for their age)  pickerel... all the rest were gone, eaten by the fast-growing cannibals.  No, I'm not advocating targeting big fish, nor am I saying there's anything wrong with your practice.  Pure C and R is certainly commendable if that's the way you like to do it."
374590,badman187,2009-08-20 18:02:00,28,Heres a pic of the fish I had to keep.I was using a gulp crawfish hooked weightless.The fish inhaled it I almost always hook them before it gets down there throat but crap happens I guess.The fish bleed like a pig I put it in the livewell had to change the water twice it was like a blood bath.
374592,smally21,2009-08-20 18:11:00,993,wouldn't we have to assume all the ministry and conservation guys were idiots if we were to endorse the 1 big fish instead of 3 little fish theory?  50+ years of conservation practise and science has led us to slot and catch limits based on size and therfore age.  its not new or a secret about protecting large breeding fish at the expense of smaller competition.
374606,bhearsum,2009-08-20 19:01:00,11," I feel much more educated on the subject, that's for sure. There's a bit more of a divide than I expected - I guess it's the sport vs. food mentality. Some of it is a matter of opinion, though (eg, ""big fish taste bad""). If I ever catch something big I probably will keep it the first time to see for myself."
373294,Jonny,2009-08-17 01:19:00,1380," Actually, to be more specific in the context of this topic,  the science behind (pickerel) slot limits is that small fish and large fish can be kept. The slot is set so that the prime breeding population falls within the slot. The slot is not meant to protect large fish.  I like to eat fish, and so does my entire family. I keep fish below the slot, and I also keep the occasional fish over the slot. If I obey the slot (and I do) then I am doing what the experts have decided is best for the fishery.  If cut into same-size pieces, fillets from large fish are virtually indistinguishable from fillets of smaller fish when eaten, IMO."

This is more to appease guys who get that once in a lifetime fish or to reduce wastage when a large fish does not survive release. The slots protect high volume reproducers and high quality reproducers. It is a simple but effect method of ensuring a stable population and future generations of larger fish."

373455,Jonny,2009-08-17 14:59:00,1380," 200 snide comments:1 fish caught. Not very good huh?   What you're referring to are muskie and pike regulations, I think. They are not actually slot limits but mimimum size limits.  In Northern Ontario the limits that are by far and away most important in everyone's mind are pickerel limits, and those are slot limits, with a minimum and a maximum set in the middle range of fish caught. The middle range is where the most numerous and prolific breeders are, as you say. The large fish are not a concern. You can have a great day on Nipissing, for example,  and catch (and keep, if you wish)  four pickerel over the slot, which is your maximum daily catch. So you could keep 4 large pickerel and call it a banner day. Trust me, for the vast majority of fishermen, that seldom happens.  Whether some people realize it or not (and not you specifically, Rick), the Northern Ontario mentality is to catch fish because you like to eat fish. For every person that posts on this board about pure catch-and-release there are hundreds, if not thousands, of Northern Ontarians who fish so that they can enjoy fish on the dinner table. As long as they abide by the fishing regulations (seasons, sanctuaries, limits, etc.) they're fine. Those who want to throw back everything they catch are welcome to do so."
373458,Roy,2009-08-17 15:16:00,13728, I beg to differ. Re-read the zone 11 regulations. You're allowed four walleye only one of which can be over the slot.

373496,Jonny,2009-08-17 17:23:00,1380," For people who enjoy eating fish, that doesn't happen.   Both these scenarios break the regulations. You must not let wild fish or game spoil. You can be charged for doing so. It doesn't matter if you changed your mind about eating them or you let them spoil in your feezer, or you simply want to throw them out; you are breaking the law if you do so.  Anyone for whom fish is regular table fare doesn't have fish in the freezer for very long."
373719,singingdog,2009-08-18 10:41:00,1047,"Yep. I want to catch them again.  We have a guy here in town that fishes every morning, every evening. He targets 'eyes, but takes bass as well.

373759,Jonny,2009-08-18 13:58:00,1380," What I imagine from your description is some old-timer whose main outings are for fishing (from the shore?). He provides for himself and probably a few old girls who don't fish but love to eat fish, and a few old friends who can't fish for themselves any more. And he obviously knows how to fish.  Good for him. He isn't going to impact the fishery all by himself, and he's doing what he's allowed to do, so I wouldn't be too hard on him.  --  Now you're going to come back and tell me that he's a young good-for-nothing on welfare and sells his fish under the table, but I wouldn't know that from your description."
373778,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-18 15:46:00,1022," Unless this guy and his family eat fish everyday, he is definetely over the POSESSION limit in his freezer (if he is keeping this many fish everyday).

373785,Jonny,2009-08-18 16:00:00,1380," I guess it depends what ""all the time"" means. Half a dozen times a summer? It doesn't say he has a stringer every day, and ""all the time"" is one of those nebulous expressions, like ""a couple"".  It also depends how often he eats fish, and how often he provides fish for friends and/or relatives. Lacking specifics, I have to think that he's not dumb enough to walk down the street with his catches and still go over the possession limit.  Funny how we (including myself, yes) tend to think the worst when a guy has some success."

I wouldn't read too much into the original post and get outraged about it because there's too little information and there's also the possibility of exaggeration.  If 'Singingdog' was outraged by what he saw, I'm sure he could have already called the ""Report-a-Poacher"" hotline. Or is he just relaying an impression?

373050,Terry,2009-08-16 11:52:00,14456,"yup, smaller fish taste better and are healthier big fish lay lots of eggs and I get more enjoyment from catching a big fish then eating it , if I release it there is a chance I can catch it again  plus I don't want to be one of those guys that keep everything then ask gee whiz, what happened to all the big fish I use to catch here. they all seem to be gone  but that's just me"
373051,MCTFisher9120,2009-08-16 11:59:00,3761,"Bass is all we keep alongside a rare pike catch. If the pike were 30"" or bigger CPR would be in effect. As for bass, nothing bigger than 2 lbs i will take anymore. Last year I kept some bigger fish and well didn't know or have the equipment to get a good photograph in the boat so fish were always brough back to camp.  Long story short this year i have kept 3 bass in the 1-1.8lb range and a pike that was 3.4lbs.  Catch Photograph Release =CPR"
373054,splashhopper,2009-08-16 12:32:00,2931,"I started releasing most fish I catch this year... I do keep perch and will likely keep a small rainbow or two... the rest go back in the river to swim another day..  It is really ""the hunt"" for the fish that keeps me pumped up on fishing... not so much the meal.   That being said....  Some responses on this thread seem to suggest that the bigger fish have better gene pools... how do they get big in they first place?  They have to live..... one way or another they gotta have a chance to live...."
373056,Terry,2009-08-16 12:39:00,14456,"yeah, but big fish you know can reproduce big fish..so you want them to reproduce  but small fish are a crap shoot  that's why they use the same bull for sperm the top race horses, they are proven"
373063,taildancer66,2009-08-16 12:57:00,2,"any walleye i catch over slot size(18"") goes back. i'll take a couple of pics if it's big enough, then back in the water asap. we have a great fishery in red lake and i believe most locals do the same."
373072,Rich Clemens,2009-08-16 13:35:00,3131,"I release just about everything I catch.   I may keep a couple bass or a mess of crappy for a fish fry, but that's about it."
373074,lunkerbasshunter,2009-08-16 13:38:00,2585,unless its not going to make it i throw back the big fish  Cheers!
373093,Mike the Pike,2009-08-16 14:54:00,3421,I only eat Walleye but when I get a big one she goes back.  I once read the average female Walleye lays 14 000 to 19 000 eggs where a walleye over 30 inches in the 11 to 12 pound range can lay up 65 000 eggs so this fish contributes alot during spawning.  I have caught some big walleye in Quinte who took the hook too deep and died they were consumed not wasted but I found the larger fish not as good to eat.  Its a matter of choice I just respect the big females who are a major producer to our fisherie.  MTP
373099,Burning Babies,2009-08-16 15:00:00,150,"My reasons for releasing big fish, in order:  Maintaining population structure Maintaining genetic stock Smaller fish taste better Fiberglass reproductions last longer  I don't get bent out of shape about someone keeping an occasional big fish however."
373101,Gerritt,2009-08-16 15:01:00,6129,Someone have multiple accounts??
373113,bhearsum,2009-08-16 15:22:00,11,Thanks for all the replies folks - I feel more educated on this subject now!
373114,smally21,2009-08-16 15:26:00,993,"there was a picture on the longpoint page about an unnamed charter showing 68 bass laid out on the lawn.  how many of those fish will get eaten?  you know as well as i do they will sit in a tupperware container in the freezer ""til we have enough for a big feed"" then 4 months later they'll be found and chucked out.  killed for no reason.  of every picture we see of a nice fat bass that ""was released""  half are  taken on shore with the guys car in the background - that fish is dead.  worm filled, slimy, soft fleshed largemouth yum!!!  the piles of giant walleye dragged up on downriggers seem to get released as well but they always seem to be laid out on cardboard with a knife in the picture. as much as recreational angling will never touch commercial fishing numbers i still shake my head at people keeping big fish. however having said that the conservation gurus set these limits and i trust they know what they are doing. at the end of the day anyone not going over their limit is guilty of nothing."
373127,danbouck,2009-08-16 16:06:00,4380,If it's within the regs you can do as you please  I do not keep big fish because I am never given the chance. Not that I'd keep them anyway
373154,bbog,2009-08-16 18:58:00,665,Big ones always go back (assuming they will survive). Only keep what I will eat and I choose not to eat older and prime breeders.
373163,Ben_Daniels,2009-08-16 19:28:00,435,"I don't really like fish  ....I think I've kept 3 fish in the past 5 years, all smaller fish that were just barely legal to keep, the flesh always tastes better on the smaller ones!  -Ben"
373165,Spiel,2009-08-16 19:40:00,9065,"""Do you always throw back the big fish?""  Well I could reply with an indepth answer and relate all the varibles that may arise when deciding whether to keep or release but the short answer is, NO!"
373192,bigfish1965,2009-08-16 21:18:00,3382,"I think it is quite amazing how, over the last 15 to 20 years, the entire ethos of anglers has changed and most everyone is onboard with the CPR and selective harvest. The effects are obvious and fishing opportunities remain as good as they have been in spite of reduced stocking and resources. It is a testament to all those who have shown responsibility of ownership of our resources. The science is behind slot limits and we have seen the success of it."
373203,Kinger,2009-08-16 21:34:00,351,"Big Fish = quick picture and back in the water. Especially the females, come on now.  I think you have to be pretty ignorant to keep giant female fish. They are miracles and have amazing genes and instincts to have reached such a size. Those are the fish you want reproducing!!  MMMMmmmMMmm this 48"" Northern sure tastes like bum."
373285,brifishrgy,2009-08-17 00:59:00,559,Big fish get released unless they are eyes from Erie .. then they are on the menu .. have kept some bigger bass because of excessive bleeding and the odd tourney loss fish
