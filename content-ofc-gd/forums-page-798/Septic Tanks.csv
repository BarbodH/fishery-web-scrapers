375305,jigger08,2009-08-22 19:09:00,38,Looking at a home that needs a downstairs bathroom and is on a septic tank.Beyond the obvious(toilet shower costs) what are the requirments and costs of sinking in a tank and pump to move the goods 25' to the tank.This would be done from a room that has the collector and is the outside wall facing the tank.It is the best case scenario for location but I don't know the ramifications of cutting in a tank and adding a pump.Any advice would be greatly appreciated as our house is basically sold and the next one should happen quick.

375373,Woodsman,2009-08-23 00:25:00,1286,I can't comment on the current cost but you don't require to pump the sewage 25' to the tank. You only require to pump it high enough that it can join your regular sewage drain system. Most likely 4'-6' vertically.
375377,dagoat_1,2009-08-23 00:37:00,72,Woodsman is absolutely correct.  We did this last year when we added a bathroom in the basement.  Our main sewage pipe was about 5' up the wall.
