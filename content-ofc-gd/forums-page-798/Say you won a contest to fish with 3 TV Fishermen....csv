374554,Roy,2009-08-20 16:45:00,13728, Thanks for the heads up Mike. Glad you're paying attention.
374658,lhousesoccer,2009-08-20 21:52:00,442,"JF - have you personally fished with any tv fishing pros, and therefore are basing this statement on your personal experience?  Or are you just assuming that TV pros will cop an attitude when fishing with us ""lowly people""?  I personally have been fortunate enough to spend a number of days in the past fishing with 3 different TV pros (not all at once ... different guys, different years) previously mentioned by others in this thread, and I couldn't disagree more.  They weren't there because I won some sort of contest and therefore had to be there.  They were there on their own accord.  I was immediately put at ease by their openness, friendliness, and their ""I'm just a guy who loves to fish, just like you"" attitude.  I had a great time, and so did they, and we still keep in touch to this day."
374670,GBW,2009-08-20 22:12:00,8460,  Dave's a stalker!  HAHAHAHA!  just kidding!
374696,JohnF,2009-08-20 23:07:00,3494," Nope. I'm sure many or all of the pros mentioned can loosen up with friends on occasion. I'd feel sorry for them if they couldn't. I was basing it on my experiences with golf pros and professional athletes in other sports. Some of them are friends of mine and they're different when it's just us guys having a few beers. I think it's cuz they know I was there when they were ordinary folks. But they tend to get used to distancing themselves from the common folk and become somewhat aloof, or perhaps the right word is condescending. I know I'm not as good as them at their chosen sports, but I sure don't need constant reminders. The fishing pros reading this will know what I mean, and whether or not it applies to them. I'm not necessarily knocking them for it. It's kinda natural to become conditioned to the deference or adulation (it depends on the persons involved) and come to expect it from everyone. It takes a really big man to survive his own celebrity. I'm just generally underwhelmed by folks who've spent so much time on a pedestal they start to believe they've never been and never will be anywhere else. I want my heroes to be real people, not iconic figures. YMMV  JF"

They're all great guys to spend a day on a boat with, but my picks? In no particular order:  Mark Kulik Mark Krupa Big Jim McLaughlin  Mark Kulik is not just a great angler, but a very good personal friend for nearly three decades. Enough said.  Mark Krupa never ceases to make me laugh - wonderful guy, great photographer and always shows up with a big bag of Montreal's most awesome bagels.  Big Jim because he's the picture of 'class act' in every single way - truly wonderful guy who knows how to fish and who always makes a day in the boat magical.  I couldn't care less where we went, but Munro Lake, in northern Manitoba, would probably be my first choice. Average pike is about 12 pounds, there are lots of honest 20 - 25 pound gators, and a slow afternoon would mean landing about 40 fish apiece. Oh yeah, the grayling run around three pounds on average, and gobble dry flies as fast as you can huck them out there. Heaven on a three-weight."

Looks as though Mercer's dance card is full so I'll wait till the traffic dies down.  Pete Maina because he knows what he's doing and just a hoot to yak with. A really good human being and friend. Marc Thorpe is not considered a TV personality but he does more TV and Video work than most TV dudes. He's also a friend and I cherish every moment that I get a chance to hit the water with Marc.

In all seriousness, I've obviously fished with Dave, and I've also been lucky enough to fish with JP, and Paul Powis.  All three guys are class act dudes.  They feed you with non-stop tips and tricks, are always trying to get YOU onto the big fish, and I felt like I was fishin' with one of my buddies right from the get-go with all three fishin' Pro's.

One of the best fisherman I know is just a regular old OFNer and I know he could outfish Izumi on any given day. I just went with that because 1. we all know them from watching the various shows on television over the years and 2. in order to be a tv host you must have obvious passion for the sport of fishing, in watching these hosts fish and talk about fishing and the way they treat and handle the fish with various degrees of respect, you feel like you get to know them.  So I think we all have hosts we love and hate...there are some tv personalities that are just unwatchable.

My son is the only pro I can play comfortably with. I don't expect any more or less from him than ""Dad, you really suck at this."" so we get along fine.

I'd rather just get out with fisherpeople who really really know what they're doing and are willing to share. If they have a cool bassboat so much the better.  Celebs are too often too wired into their celeb-ness to loosen up with anyone but their friends, and the last thing I want to do is spend time with someone who makes me feel like they're being inconvenienced by spending time with me.
