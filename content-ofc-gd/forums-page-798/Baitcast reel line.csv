375702,CrankbaitJon,2009-08-24 01:20:00,13,"Hello,  I put some heavy braided line on my new baitcast reel but the line is slipping.  When the spool is on the tightest setting, the line still move because its slipping on the spool.  Can any help?  Thanks! Jon"
375707,Pigeontroller,2009-08-24 01:24:00,2793,"Braid has little to no stretch, so it will not grip the spool. Most of us use mono backing, spool a bunch of mono on then tie the braid to it and finish spooling with braid."
375710,Syn,2009-08-24 01:32:00,519,Some lines like power pro come with a piece of foam tape to prevent slipping on the spool. Put it on just before your arbor knot.
375715,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-24 01:49:00,947,or you can put a piece of Electrical tape on the spool then when tying on the knot to spool make sure it digs into the tape.
375722,Greencoachdog,2009-08-24 02:02:00,8163,"  Tape,foam, and nasal excrement (boogers) are for sissies, women and children!!!  A few lose wraps around the arbor then really put the tension to the line and pack on the yards of braid!!!  If your line slips after spooling with braid... it's a sure sign that your estrogen level is way too high!!!"

375746,Cudz,2009-08-24 02:58:00,2652,put about 20 yards of mono backing on it and it will not slip.
375758,spinnerbaitking,2009-08-24 03:17:00,1622,"Go to a park tie your line to a tree & go for a walk put a piece of tape on over your line & reel it back in, no more problem, go catch fish Richard"
375765,CrankbaitJon,2009-08-24 03:46:00,13,Great I just fixed it.  Thanks everyone!  Jon
375773,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-24 04:46:00,947,"  With this technique you won't just catch fish, But also people or animals walking between you and the tree.  Depending how high or low your fishing of course."
375780,spinnerbaitking,2009-08-24 10:24:00,1622,"Maybe you should use heavier line then, hate to see some thing or some one get away Richard "
375781,Randy,2009-08-24 10:37:00,115,Use a double loop of line on the spool before the knot. That will keep the line from slipping on the spool.
