375267,banshee807,2009-08-22 15:20:00,1,What's a fair price for a used 14' Sportspal Transom canoe? It's a few years old and has some scratches and such but no holes or any other major damage.

375302,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-22 18:48:00,0,these things seem to be wildly popular on this board.  post pics and ask for an offer.
375454,Jonny,2009-08-23 04:20:00,1380,I had one for many years.  Sight unseen... if in good/very good condition and no leaks... no less than $700.  Maybe somewhat more.  IMO.  Any old Sportspal will have some scratches and minor dings. Thin metal.  http://bwmarineproducts.com/images/Sportsp...-%20English.pdf  http://www.oakorchardcanoe.com/sportspal.php
