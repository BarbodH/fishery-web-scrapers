375496,skinny,2009-08-23 13:37:00,442,ok I'm from Delhi area and got back into fishing this year. I quit when they started to make you pay to fish. (My kids aso started to fish this summer). Well i'm hooked I try to get out as much as possible. the tackle has changed so much. There wasn't all the plastic stuff out there when i last fished and i think buzz baits were just starting or i was just becoming awear. anyway I do shore fishing (no boat yet) and so far i have used yum buzz frogs and a buzz bait with not to ba of luck but I want to increase my luck I bought up a bunch of tackle from a guy getting out of fishing on another hobby forum I belong to. lots of jig suff and plastics but I'm not sure how to fish them  I texas rigged a worm and tossed it out few time and wound it back in but is that the right way  I also have been becomming the birdnest king on a bait caster I aquired . I have learned alot like i use to just cast and see where it lands by the splash now I'm starting to see what i'm doing but it's not always right hence birds nest   ok got to run for a bit  oh the locations I have been fishing the dam in Delhi   (havn't gotten any fish for a while there ) waterford ponds  it's been ok but slow) turkey point  out but the old restarant by the seadoo rentals (had few hits but no takers) booths harbour   few hits pulled a few out port rowen   pulled one out  (kids like fishing here) long point  didn't getany and hard time looking for spots to fish  looking for more places to fish and better results and ways to use my tackle  also kinda looking at a 12 foot jon boat and pros cons to this idea
