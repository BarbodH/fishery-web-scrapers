375767,jediangler,2009-08-24 04:25:00,1923,"Puslinch info: Puslinch lake is the largest kettle lake in North America. There are pike, walleye, largemouth, crappie, perch, bluegill, sunfish, rockbass, catfish and carp. Deepest spot I've found was 22ft. Heavily weeded. No bait. One ramp on the north shore at McLintock's Landing. Wear your PFD, this lake has taken two people already this year.  Good luck."
