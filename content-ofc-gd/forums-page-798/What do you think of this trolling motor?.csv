374775,danbo,2009-08-21 04:09:00,2646,MotorGuide at LeBarons Thruster® 46 HT • Shaft length: 36” • Peak thrust: 46 lbs. • 5–speeds forward and 2–speeds reverse CODE: 960010040 $ 185.94
374793,scugpg,2009-08-21 10:58:00,1373," Pat, go to Angling Outfitters just donw the road in Woodstock! Jocelyn has refurbished motors at a great price.  Go with the 50lb Minnkota Maxxum $249 refurbished. It has the maximizer, battery meter and tilt handle.  If that is too pricey he has tons of Minnkota Enduras for probably $100 or less and 50lbs or so.  Give them a call first to see what they have, prices could be lower."
374795,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-21 11:35:00,1022,"If you want to do the job right, go with a bow mount. It gives you better boat control, but is more expensive. I would recommend nothing less than a 50lb for that size boat. I have a 14.5' with a 36lb thrust and it really has to work to get it moving, especially in a current. When I upgrade it will be a 55lb thrust. Whatever you decide on make sure it has maximizer technology."
374880,scugpg,2009-08-21 14:18:00,1373, Well said. If you can go bow mount do it! I use a 70lb bowmount on my 14ft aluminum and never have to worry about any wind or current PLUS it will work on a bigger boat as well. I had a 40lb bowmount on it and took it back 2 days later. And I have a light boat.
374891,muskeybugged,2009-08-21 15:07:00,282,I have a cheap little one on the back of my 14'.  I have learned to let the drift do most of my work and use the motor for the finer adjustments.  I need a bowmount ...
374925,Uncle Buck,2009-08-21 16:53:00,1000,I've got a 50lb bowmount on my 16.5 aluminum and with 3 guys i get 2mph with it...
374927,NAW,2009-08-21 17:09:00,4022,"I have a 36lb Minni mounted to the stern of my 14' aluminum.  It pushes it along pretty good.  It would be nice to have some more juice though.  I got the motor for 1/2 price,  then bought the biggest batery I could find.  It runs for a long time without needing a charge.  That about the only good thing about it!  I would definitly pass on the motor you've shown above.  You'll just end up wanting to upgrade after a few times out on the water."
374937,fishinguypat,2009-08-21 17:31:00,547,yeah i asked people and they said 30lb thrust for a 15 foot boat is enough but...no i will not buy this i think i'll buy a minn kota 36lb or 40lb
375146,johndox,2009-08-22 01:53:00,54,My14' boat came with the exact motor on it when I bought it. If possible get a bow mount these are in the way if you have a tiller and dont seem to have very much power. I take mine off and leave it on the floor of my boat most of the time where it is out of the way.
