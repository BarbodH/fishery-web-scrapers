374991,Jonny,2009-08-21 20:04:00,1380,"I picked up this copy of ""Real Fishing"" on a trip to the Rideau area last week. Henry N., you can't miss this one... your favourite girl is featured!  There's a good article on turkey vultures (which we never used to see in the Nipissing area), and a rather so-so (non-commital) one on cormorants, which we see WAY too many of. "
374998,ciceri,2009-08-21 20:28:00,535,she's a cutie
375007,ketchenany,2009-08-21 20:50:00,3229," Doesn't anyone watch, What a Catch?"
375016,DRIFTER_016,2009-08-21 21:01:00,10439,  Yep!!! Kathryn ROCKS!!!!!!!  I only made it through about 10 minutes of Ms. Izumi's show before I couldn't handle it any more. Cute but her voice sounds like finger nails on a chalk board!!!
375022,hoot33,2009-08-21 21:14:00,93,"a definite cutie, i picked this issue up too, decent read."
375027,danbouck,2009-08-21 21:29:00,4380,  I can't get through 5 minutes of her show.
375033,Jonny,2009-08-21 21:52:00,1380," Might turn the ""new generation"" on to the sport though."
375037,John,2009-08-21 21:59:00,2956, I watch it with the sound off Dan.....
375052,crankbait,2009-08-21 22:47:00,82, I find her so annoying
375076,danbouck,2009-08-21 23:29:00,4380, There we go!
375084,Greencoachdog,2009-08-21 23:39:00,8163,  Are the pages stuck together yet???
375090,danbouck,2009-08-21 23:43:00,4380,  :lol:
375104,Jonny,2009-08-22 00:07:00,1380,I went to the article on cormorants first. I must be slowing down.
375117,Greencoachdog,2009-08-22 00:35:00,8163,  If the Cormorant article pages are stuck together... yer a sick puppy!!!
