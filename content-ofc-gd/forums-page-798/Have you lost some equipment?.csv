374108,smally21,2009-08-19 12:58:00,993,are we sure some frustrated fisherman didn't pitch them out of the sunroof?
374149,Raf,2009-08-19 14:42:00,3495, or their significant other.

375338,StarLost,2009-08-22 21:12:00,3,Bump ...  OK.  Last chance folks.
375342,JohnF,2009-08-22 21:50:00,3494," Actually, ya might be doing the loser of the lures a favour by keeping them. If he's anything like the rest of us he blows bux trying to find the ultimate lure, and none of them ever quite live up to expectations (or advertising). He's probably thrilled to have an excuse to start all over cuz he knows that this time he'll get it right fer sure, and he won't be guilted about buying more crap cuz the other got lost. Everybody wins.  Good for you for trying though.  JF"
375354,Syn,2009-08-22 23:23:00,519,Maybe God is not so subtly telling you to switch from fly fishing to bass/pike hunting using crankbaits?
375362,oates,2009-08-22 23:48:00,151,"Recently, I located a MAC laptop with DJ equiptment, est. $4000 - I checked the dudes email - called him and he came and got it. You hope that someone returns the favour one day for sure."
373846,StarLost,2009-08-18 19:22:00,3,"As I was cycling in the Guelph area this week, I found something that one of our bass fishing colleagues seems to have lost.  It appears that some equipment was blown out of the back of a truck or a boat.  In all, I recovered 56 crankbaits and spinnerbaits along with a couple of carriers.  There was no identification in the carriers, but if you can sort of identify what I have found and perhaps where I found it ...  I priced out what I found and it looks like about $400-$450 worth of gear.  Since I'm a fly fisherman I know how I'd feel at the loss.  You can contact me at sta[emailÂ protected] .   Please, only serious and honest responses.  Cheers all"
373847,mbosh1980,2009-08-18 19:29:00,349,"its not mine, but you sure are a standup guy for trying to get it back to its owner"

Hope you stick around...Good on you. If ever I lose anything of value I hope that someone like you finds it.  Can't really help you with the find.......but if there are no takers you can get an inexpensive spinning combo and start a new way of angling.  CHEERS right back to you!!  RFS "

373993,Lunatic,2009-08-19 01:27:00,536,"56 crank baits. whoever lost it,must be a very serious fisherman.or he has been collecting for along time"
373995,danbouck,2009-08-19 01:29:00,4380,  56 lures is what falls outta my boat glove box when I open it. Don't tell my wife!
374015,Garry2Rs,2009-08-19 02:07:00,1425,I have seen plastic boxes levitate from the floor of a bass boat and fly away... Fortunately I was checking the mirror at the time and was able to go back and get them.
374017,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-19 02:09:00,947,is it ok if i post this on other fishing forums?
374018,ohhenrygsr,2009-08-19 02:12:00,947,We should have a lost and found section

374047,TJQ,2009-08-19 03:18:00,7806, yup
374050,StarLost,2009-08-19 03:24:00,3," I've posted this on a couple of others that I know, but no honest response yet so, yes, feel free to pass it around.  But, honestly guys, enough of the accolades especially for someone you don't know.  To the fellow who suggested about Karma, thankyou and I can only hope that the good seeds watered in this life really do have a positive effect, if not in this life then perhaps the next (just so happens I am buddhist so I understand the concept fully, just don't go on too much about killing fish ... I'm mostly catch and release).  As for honesty ... well, remember no good deed goes unpunished.  I try to be honest to a fault, but even I have spent some time as a guest of Her Majesty the Queen by right of the Province of Ontario ...  By the by ... I'm giving this about a couple of weeks to resolve itself.  After that, I have a nephew that looks to score a few ... little rat even had the gall to remind about ""birthdays I had missed"" ... damned starving university students !!!"
374051,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-19 03:30:00,0,let us know if you find the owner! classy move friend.
