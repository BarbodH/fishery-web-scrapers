Fishing is deffinately on the agenda.  How is the fishing on Kioshkokwi Lake?  I believe bass and trout are the main sportfish.  I can't find much info on the net.  Is it specs or lakers? what is the local baitfish?  Any pointers?  Thanks, should be a great trip.  A little cool but hopefully dry.  Tight Lines!"
