375141,discophish,2009-08-22 01:34:00,392,"You should have a Pro-Flow switch at the helm.  It should say open/closed.  I believe they should all have it, but not all have the recirculation.  In our boat we have it by the throttle controls at the knee."

So you are right, pop the lid and girls at the docks will dive in.  That happened last night in my dreams, so it's absolutely true."
