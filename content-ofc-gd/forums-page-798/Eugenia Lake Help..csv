200770,steverowbotham,2008-05-12 23:51:00,1800,"Bass and Trout. Thats pretty much it. Bass are closed until the 4th Saturday in June, trout there are best fished from shore anyways"
200780,nancur373,2008-05-13 00:08:00,1211,Try for some trout then I suppose.
200781,Cookslav,2008-05-13 00:08:00,1457,"Eugenia Trout will be feeding HEAVILY on insects this time of year. Were ever the Wind is comming from...work the other side as thats were the largest concentrations will be. If your lucky you'll get some sun, and a flashy lure might get 'em going....wabbler, mepps  Good luck."
200782,steverowbotham,2008-05-13 00:09:00,1800,"I've done well from shore by the dam, which is accessable"
200791,nancur373,2008-05-13 00:19:00,1211,I assume you can use live bait there?
