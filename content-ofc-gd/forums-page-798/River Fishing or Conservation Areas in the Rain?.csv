I went to my local tackle shop and told them, they said 'ofcoure not, river fishing is dead in the rain'. I have seen plenty of reports here from the lakes, in the rain, even people favouring light rain.  My question is, with showers forecast tommorow, is it worth the effort to  -a- wade shallow rivers -b- rent a canoe in a conservation area (i.e. deeper water, rain less of an issue?) -c- give the entire idea a pass, won't catch jack  Appreciate your expertise and opinions, I like the rain so it doesn't bother me (I'm from N. Ireland, you think you got rain this summer, we get at least 265 days in a year where it will rain at some point of the day, my earliest memorty fishing in Ireland is getting skunked with my grandfather, casting off a dock for a few hours, only to see scores of seals pop their heads up, it was pouring rain the whole time!)"

375303,laszlo,2009-08-22 18:50:00,487,i've fished the grand many times within 24 hours of heavy rain and had NO LUCK. now light rain is do-able if you get there while it just starts or not too long after.  i would hit a smaller lake myself.
