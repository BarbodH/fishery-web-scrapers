Bait balls been marked out of Oakville/PC in 60-100 feet of water. water temps in the comfort range of salmon have been 35-60 feet of water. Far off shore (300+ fow -30-50' down) are decent for coho&bows)  Cutbait, and SD/Dodger + flys seem to be working well, never had much on spoons this year. Just one of those years, but they need to do something about this fishery fast.  MNR and their Atlantic program is just to academic, hope they get back to the pacific planting programs of the past eg: 70, early 80's."
