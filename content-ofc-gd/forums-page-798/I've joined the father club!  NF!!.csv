So my wife's water broke on Monday evening and she had to endure a very long labour which ultimately ended in a C-Section wednesday morning @ 3:08AM.  The baby was just getting too stressed after such a long journey, but I feel truely blessed.  This was the most emotional, satisfying and undeniable love that I've felt in my life.  Here's my new son Jackson, born Aug. 19th - 6lbs 6oz:  "

375089,JohnF,2009-08-21 23:43:00,3494,"So much fer yer fishing time. Now'll you'll be spending time in arenas and ball parks, spending the money you used to spend on fishing gear on skates, sticks, pads and little teeny jocks. Your beer money is now designated for registration in hockey, baseball, soccer and power skating, but that's all right cuz you won't have time to drink beer any more. You'll be driving kids to games - everywhere.  And you know the funny part is that - YOU'LL LOVE EVERY SECOND OF IT.  Congratulations Pops.  JF"

That being said, don't forget that your wife is who you will spend your life with, don't forget her.
