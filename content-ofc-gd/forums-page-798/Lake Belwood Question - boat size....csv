I'm in Kitchener, and sometimes I can't get out there or the lake is not comfortably fishable (weather), and I just want to get out fishing sometimes with the family.  I have a 19' walkaround deep V fiberglass boat with a 115 Merc.  Is this too much boat for Belwood?  I used to fish for a lot of Pike/Bass up north but not on a boat like mine.  My main concerns are water depth, rocks etc.  Can I fish Belwood with my boat? What's the launch like, and is there any docking available?  thanks, BigJim."

The lake is plenty deep for your boat, BUT about 1km pass the northern bridge it gets really shallow 2ft in the river. A few points on the east side of the main lake have some big rocks, so just stay back from them a bit. Also stay away from bird crap island. We drove the boat a tad to close and about 75 seagulls were startled and started flying towards us overhead doing bombing runs. Luckily we did not get hit.  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source...mp;t=h&z=18  115 Merc. is huge for that lake but you'll be fine with a trolling motor and anchor. Did not see boats docked but they have a dock and people with seados, canoes were tied to it. They had a fence with lots of bigger boats inside for storage too."
