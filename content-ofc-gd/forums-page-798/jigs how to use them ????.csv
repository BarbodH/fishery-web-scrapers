375798,Mike Pike,2009-08-24 12:59:00,1332,"Well Skinny, there are as many ways to use your 'plastics' as there are fisherman.  Basically, your texas rigged worm is a nice weedless way to target bass.  They work well pitched into weeds or just dragged along bottom.  Jigs with a twistertail grub are great just hopped along the bottom as you retrieve it.  Adding a minnow or bit of worm to this presentation is effective.  Tubes are terrific just pitched into pockets in the weeds.  Sometimes the hits come while the tube is sinking and other times when the tube hits the bottom.  I'll pop it and drag it a bit along the bottom to cause some interest.  Just the basics.  Other will add more, I'm sure.  Good luck!"
