That happened somewhere along the Indian river, or a small off chute of it.  Indian river leads into Rice lake.  The carp in the video was really out of it and was near death, hence the reason she was able to pick it up.  I think it won 2nd or 3rd place in the season finale of AFV - I think it was back in the mid '90's that happened."
