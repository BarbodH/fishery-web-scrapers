374274,Fishing 24/7,2009-08-19 21:50:00,709,  i cant get over the size of this fish man!
374290,Leecher,2009-08-19 22:38:00,7832, Yeah Kev I can't believe it either..... I love this shot also and you know what.... it's still swimming in there to be caught another day..... come fall this brute will put on a few more ounces and probably reach the 6Lbs+
374293,misfish,2009-08-19 23:04:00,29133,Simply awesome fish you two boys caught.  Sweet largies Jacques and Paul.   Very impressive.
374325,Leecher,2009-08-20 00:14:00,7832, Thanks Brian!!!  It was an awesome day

374675,jaydub,2009-08-20 22:29:00,145,Nicely done boys!  That PB's gonna be a hard one to beat.  Great story & pics!!
374697,Leecher,2009-08-20 23:07:00,7832," Paul I know exactly how you felt.... that was the ultimate excitement in bass fishing Thanks again for a great day!!!  Kev, we all should hit that lake this coming weekend.... I'm sure there's bigger ones swimming around   Thanks Jay!!!  Yes it will be hard to beat... your PB smallie you caught last night on Simcoe will also be a tough one to beat"
374768,Cudz,2009-08-21 03:41:00,2652,Jaydub will trump his smallie easily by the end of bass season.
375111,Leecher,2009-08-22 00:22:00,7832, I like your attitude Chris!!!  I'm sure we will see or hear about it one way or another Don't forget to try Little Woodie
375113,Cudz,2009-08-22 00:24:00,2652,I might take the family out tomorrow but if not I will give little woodchuck a shot monday.
375202,snagmaster,2009-08-22 06:38:00,250,awesome largies man. Sweet you caught them on all different baits.
375282,Leecher,2009-08-22 16:44:00,7832, Thanks snagmasteral!!!  We always try different lures when out on the hunt for bass... This time they were bigger in size
375372,Fishing 24/7,2009-08-23 00:24:00,709,went out fishing today jaques but i didnt hook a beast like yours!  im going back tommorow tho in the serch for the nickel!  there out there.  just a matter of how and when and what type of structure to hit.  can you give me any tips!  your the nickel master!
375380,Whitespinnerbait,2009-08-23 00:48:00,2038, Yeah i'll give you a tip.............JitterBug......
375410,Leecher,2009-08-23 02:18:00,7832, Kev sometimes they shut right down.... there was a cold front yesterday and after talking with Paul tonight.... heard the surface temp was at 73C today   major change from last Sunday which was in the 80ies.... The tip I can give you is go straight to the North side into the big bay and start working the pencil reeds with a jitterbug or hula popper..... then proceed to working the slop using sinking minnows wackie style.... spinnerbaits is always a killer also Good luck tomorrow.... will be waiting for your report   Remember what we talked about tonight Paul.... give the popper a try and see.... you just never know Good luck to both of you!!! Jacques

373991,Greencoachdog,2009-08-19 01:25:00,8163,"Is it just me, or have I seen these fish before?... I think someone has a pond/holding pen in their backyard and these fish are stuffed full of bait daily so they'll grow... and then transported from lake to lake on the weekends in a livewell to be photographed for different reports!!!    Bwahahaha!!! Jacques!... congrats on your nickel and some change!!!  You and Paul really got into some beauties on that trip!  Thanks for taking the time to post that excellent report!!!"

374147,The Urban Fisherman,2009-08-19 14:37:00,2050,"Sure it was your first time on that lake, but I bet it wont be your last! lol awesome fish"
373191,Leecher,2009-08-16 21:17:00,7832,"Well guys, today Paul and I targeted one of our local lake for bass..... a lake where I've never been before but only knew the name of it.... Got up at 4:15am, temperature was 21C and no wind..... Left home at 4:45am and made a pit stop to Tim and the way we go.  Got to destination at around 6:00am just before sunrise, got the boat launched and proceeded to the north side of the lake..... Surface temp was in the eighties, started working the weed lines with a chartreuse BigO and Paul had a black buzzbait.... didn't take long for Paul to land this beauty!!!    Kept working the weed line and all of sudden BANG!!!! Fish on, fought this fish for a few minutes and told Paul to get the net..... landed a 32"" pike, my PB this year.....    Kept working the weed line and got another hit..... this time was a nice smallie    As we were headed deeper on the north side, started seeing pencil reeds, so Paul switched to a white Spro frog and got rewarded with this one    I switched to a jitterbug leopard green color for some top water action too and got rewarded with this 4Lbs largie!!!    Paul got another on his Spro frog.... you can actually see the pencil reeds in the background    Kept working the pencil reeds and all of sudden get a hit on my jitterbug, BANG.... set the hook and yell to Paul ""GET THE NET"" this one is heavy..... fought it for a good 3 minutes.... got airborne a few times and knew that it was a quality fish..... once in the net, I just could not believe the size of this pure specimen     Put it on the digi scale and this massive largie weighted in at 5Lbs 6oz and measured 21 1/2""  I was so excited that I was shaking LOL  Here it is folks.... my new PB and awesome first nickel!!!    Another shot of her.... I just had to LOL    Paul got another one on his Spro    and I got another nice one on a Gulp 5"" black sinking minnow.... she weighted in at 4Lbs 1oz and measured 19 1/2"" but don't have the pic of it on my camera.... Paul has it.  I'm sure he can add the pic later  Kept going on and Paul switched to a jig n pig and got one right away on his first cast    He then switched to a white spinnerbait  and got rewarded with this brute.... 4Lbs 8oz largie    Got another shot of her    All in all was a great day of bass fishing with some awesome results......  We just could not ask for anything better.  We left around 1:00pm cause the sun was just unbearable  The lures of choice today were: White BigO and chartreuse, white Spro frog, white spinnerbait, jig n pig, Gulp 5"" sinking minnow in black, jitterbug leopard green.  All fish were released to be caught another day!!!  Thanks mon ami Paul for this awesome day of bassin I'd like to leave you with this pic for last.... 5Lbs 6oz on my right hand and 4Lbs on my left    Hope you enjoy!!! Leechman"
