I never have, but can definitely see the advantage of being able to quick change your baits.  I was told by someone when I started fishing they mess up your baits movements and shouldn't be used on Rapalas, crakbaits, ect.  Is this true or myth?  If it is true, what application are they good for?"
375048,Burning Babies,2009-08-21 22:31:00,150,"No, I don't.  We call those snap swivels in the US; I think Canadians do too.  If someone needs to change baits quickly, and can't carry multiple rods, they are much better off with a plain snap than a snap swivel IMO.  Most baits don't need the swivel, and I'd prefer to avoid unnecessary hardware encumbering my lure.  Further, if you are going to use a snap, use a quality snap like a coastlock or crosslock.  And if you truly need a swivel to avoid line twist, you need a ball-bearing swivel.  But overall, I strongly prefer a direct knot."
375050,pike slayer,2009-08-21 22:34:00,1177,"i always use them for pretty well all applications, i catch alot of fish and i dont see them hindering action of the lure. just dont cheap out on them, i get the mustad ones."
375058,Garry2Rs,2009-08-21 23:08:00,1425,I hate any extra terminal tackle and try to avoid it. However on a crankbait rod I sometimes use a SMALL snap swivel to facilitate quick bait changes.
375093,bigcougar,2009-08-21 23:46:00,2,I use swivels 100% of the time to prevent line twist. If you fish spinners and spoons you definitely need them but they are good to have when float fishing too. (the tiniest barrel swivels)
375101,Radnine,2009-08-22 00:05:00,1538,"On my rods I use braid line with a Flouro leader and I put a small swivel between the two lines. I do not use snaps anymore for quick changes, I either tie direct or use those little wire hook like thingys that are barely visible and just hook onto the eye of a lure. Honestly though I tie direct more often than knot Jim"
375133,Cudz,2009-08-22 01:18:00,2652,I only use swivels on spoons and spinner.  I always use small snaps on crankbaits and jerkbaits.  I tie direct to jigs
375158,pikehunter,2009-08-22 02:45:00,1659,"Yes mainly because of line twist and poor feeling and sensitivity in my fingers makes knot tying a chore some days, prefer ball bearing swivels although they are expensive. I bought some of Lebaron's own brand of BB swivels this spring and I regret the decision. They were cheap compared to the others but I have had to re spool because of severe line twist from trolling. The old saying is true, you get what you pay for.  As for snap swivels reducing lure action, I can't say for sure but perhaps that may be a reason I don't catch as many fish as I would like to."
375187,Dara,2009-08-22 04:05:00,3052,"I use them for the lure change ease and line twist. If I'm towing a rapala or something that will have impared action, I tie a mono leader on and make a loop to hook to the snap swivel. It stays tied to the rapala permanently"
375205,Randy,2009-08-22 09:09:00,115,"Do I use them, absolutely, but it depends on the baits I'm using. If I'm using spoons, yes, to reduce line twist. Other times I'll just use a snap and other times I'll tie direct."
