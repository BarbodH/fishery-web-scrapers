This was a really big fish, especially if you consider that reel is probably spooled with about 400yds of 80# braid and they are probably running about 25#'s of drag.  "
964079,dave524,2016-03-27 12:39:00,4508,I would have liked to see how they land 200 pounders off those rocks.

964099,Rizzo,2016-03-27 15:55:00,4754,she hooked a passing cruise ship
964101,huzzsaba,2016-03-27 16:16:00,884,Where is the ending lol?  I would be scared to stand that close to the edge. A sudden burst of energy from that fish and she would have flown off the edge
964105,NANUK,2016-03-27 16:42:00,797,And with that harness you will be swimming with the fishes
964109,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-27 18:29:00,8243,What's the purpose? Just tie a line to a car and have someone drive away. You aren't going to land the car either. When I had a dog I would tie the line to her collar and play fetch in the basement in the dead of winter. Good way to set up the drag and see exactly how much line is going out when the reel is screaming.

964309,FloatnFly,2016-03-29 14:13:00,1640,I would have liked to see how they land 200 pounders off those rocks.   the camera makes the rocks look a lot steeper than what they actually are.  theres access to the water that they have to get down to.
