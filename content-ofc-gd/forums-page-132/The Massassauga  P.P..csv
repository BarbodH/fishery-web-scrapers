963217,jjcanoe,2016-03-20 15:03:00,744,"Just wondering if you are allowed to do boat camping at the designated campsites. I was planning a canoe trip up there this year but recently (nearly a month now and improving much slower than I expected) pinched a nerve in my back so portaging, padding, and sitting for long periods is out for me for the foreseeable future.  Thought boat camping would be a better option over cancellation, never been to the area before, and it's about time I paid it a visit for some fishing/camping. Thanks"
963229,SirCranksalot,2016-03-20 16:41:00,3291,Check the park regs online but I'd be surprised if motor boats are not allowed on the G Bay sites.
963230,BillM,2016-03-20 16:45:00,17367,"No motors on any of the interior Massassauga PP lakes, GBay access is fine."
963238,jjcanoe,2016-03-20 17:08:00,744,"Yeah, my park map shows the no motor lakes, just wondered about the G-Bay sites. Park regs only seem to define rules for overnight mooring, not camping on the sites. I guess it just means I'm using the site but not canoeing to get there?  That is my best interpretation of the rules... Thanks"
963241,Musky or Specks,2016-03-20 17:18:00,2710,Yes I boat too camp there all the time
963250,Pigeontroller,2016-03-20 17:58:00,2793,Just ordered a map!  https://www.ontarioparks.com/parkstore
963259,alexmedic,2016-03-20 19:09:00,186,I have moored my boat there many times camping on a G. Bay site.  No issues at all.
963266,musky666,2016-03-20 20:20:00,126,"Depending on size of your boat, and water levels, some campsites are not the best for grounding your boat."
963332,jjcanoe,2016-03-21 03:00:00,744,"Looking at a few with sandy beach areas. 17.5' Crestliner, shouldn't have too many problems with water levels I hope."
963403,keswickman,2016-03-21 22:17:00,7,This  site http://www.angelfire.com/blues2/bcaron/campsite.html  has a description of the campsites. I have never camped on the Massasauga park sites but motored by when fishing the area below Moon falls. Must try one of these years. I prefer the isolation of the river camping above the falls.
963414,jjcanoe,2016-03-22 01:04:00,744,"Been on the angelfire site all winter lol. The Camis reservation website has a few photos of each backcountry campsite, very handy...."
963424,Mirkydog,2016-03-22 01:22:00,4,"Boat into our site every year, usually in Blackstone  harbour or Woods bay. Fishing was great last year. I have a 16' Polar Kraft never had any issues."
963559,musky666,2016-03-22 23:27:00,126,"Site 511, boat grounded out 15' from shore, 17' Starcraft-about 10 years back now. Other years water levels are higher. No problem with my 20' Flex last summer. Likely not heading there this summer, tried to get my favourite site but struckout out. Will miss the Musky chase...and sooooo many great stories from there- and the damn fish.... "
963560,SirCranksalot,2016-03-22 23:29:00,3291,Lake level is up about 2 ft in the last 2-3 yrs.
963677,BillM,2016-03-23 17:54:00,17367,"Yeah, water levels on Gbay have been pretty good.  I'll be out that way for a week in July, can't wait!"
965123,Canuck,2016-04-04 01:18:00,491,"Love the Massassauga.  I take the big boat up to the park and anchor and then hop in the dinghy and spend the day fishing.   Don't know about the camping sites but I have seen fishing boats pulled up to shore so they must be OK.  If you stay in Port Rawson, watch out for bears though."
965130,Raf,2016-04-04 02:32:00,3495,Be mindful of rattlesnakes as well.  There's a decent population in the park.
965348,backbay,2016-04-05 19:44:00,773,"As mentioned, you can't access Clear or Spider Lake  via motorized boat but there are dozens of nice sites you can anchor or even beach at. Current water levels are high for this time of year, and it'll be interesting to see what it's like in the summer, but it certainly looks like higher water again this year."
965354,SirCranksalot,2016-04-05 21:22:00,3291,"I'm a bit surprised, given that the lake didn't freeze this winter, but the levels for 2016 are forecast to be higher than 2015.  http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/dashboard/GLWLD.html"
965355,irishfield,2016-04-05 21:30:00,26272,"Current levels on GBay are ""up to the brim"" !"
965371,jjcanoe,2016-04-06 00:32:00,744,My skeg is excited!
