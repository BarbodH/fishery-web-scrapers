964175,landry,2016-03-28 03:06:00,1005,My 07 75hp optimax is running fine but today the warning beep stopped beeping as I turn the ignition key. Anyone had this problem or have any idea how I met check this out?? Don't even know where the alarm device is? Thanks Landry

Not sure what the price for Opti but as I remember the Black Max one was fairly reasonable.  It was basically a small speaker inside a grey plastic housing."

964222,landry,2016-03-28 19:53:00,1005,Someone else suggested my battery had low voltage so I will test with a new battery first. Great ideas guys. Thanks.
964450,landry,2016-03-30 12:55:00,1005,Fixed it myself. The alarm had a broken wire connector. Thanks for the Leo everyone.
