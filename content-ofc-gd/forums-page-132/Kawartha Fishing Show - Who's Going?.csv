964938,Sinker,2016-04-02 19:58:00,8692,"Working weekends sucks. I have been begging for something like this closer to home for me, and finally we get it, and I can't make it out to it. What a bummer.  S."
964946,GBW,2016-04-02 20:51:00,8460,"Kids and I went for a few hours, they had a decent time.  They scored some what could be decent baits too.  I got a new set of bluewateroptics glasses that I an very impressed with so far and the price was in my range too. "
964947,GBW,2016-04-02 20:59:00,8460,"Spoke to Mr ""Handelbarz"" himself for a bit (he's having problems getting on here from time to time like I was) and a few other folks as well.  We missed seeing JP and Big Jim speak but it was a bit funny to watch JP at the kids pond catching fish and passing the rod's off to the young ones. I did learn that this event came together in 4 weeks tops as they were planning this for next year, got all that worked out and then the LEX said, we have an opening if you think you can fill it let's do one now.  And that's why so few knew about it, last minute deal so to say..."
964960,gaspumper,2016-04-02 22:04:00,393,"We got there at 8:45 this morning they let us in then,we were told about it at the Bowmanville show.Left at 10:45.My son and my buddy got a new rod and reel from BJ Tackle.I got a new Enigma Phenom Titanium jigging rod from one of the dealers.and a few baits .Prices cheaper then if you bought at a store and of coarse no taxes."
964981,James77,2016-04-03 01:46:00,175,Make sure you come say Hi! I'm in the Fishaholic booth.
964993,ecmilley,2016-04-03 03:35:00,2163,Got some time shirts. Be seeing the Bluewater optics guy at Gagnon next week has some.parts for a 7 year old.pair of glasses that have been through a war. Show was OK some deals there on rods and reels if u look. Pro just has a Shimano extrude extrude extrude or some.name 100bux off no tax I left it there
965060,GBW,2016-04-03 18:40:00,8460,It's open till 4 pm today for those looking for last minute deals on things they may not want to pack up and take back
965178,jimmer,2016-04-04 14:43:00,2730,Bought a Handlebarz spinner bait. He seemed to have some good prices. Wish there were more deals throughout. I was actually surprised at some of the prices on tackle. I can buy some of the product locally for a much better price than those being offered at the show. Nice to have a show close to home though. I did like the info on the Roughguard application for trucks. Will be looking into that.
963942,James77,2016-03-25 19:24:00,175,So the people that manage the Toronto Fishing Show have put together a show in the Kawartha's. April 1-3rd at the Lindsay Exhibition.  Apparently there will be the mega tank and a trout pond!  Free entrance too.  Who's planning on going?
963949,GBW,2016-03-25 21:34:00,8460,Really?  News to me but if so I'll be there Sat afternoon with my kids as it is a kids weekend for me.

963959,Tom McCutcheon,2016-03-25 22:49:00,627,"Muskies Canada Inc., Kawartha Chapter will be there and we will be doing something special for the children this year. Along with education for the adults, the kids can learn how to build their own fishing lure called a ""Go Getter"".... This is a small inline spinner bait with small worm hook, and when they are done making it (choose their own colour of beads and blade) they get to keep it. Kind of a fun way to get them interested.  Hope to see a lot of folks out for this inaugural event."

963981,Sinker,2016-03-26 03:07:00,8692,"Wow, this is news to me. Hope i can swing by.  S."
963996,fishindevil,2016-03-26 10:14:00,6254,Yes I live 20mins away and just heard about it the other day !! They should advertise it a little better I guess and seeing how it's the first time being held would be great to see all the fishing related vendors from the area plus get the word out about their product !!!  I will def stop in and check it out as I do plan on getting my boat from storage next weekend but I'm sure I can find a few hours to check it out !!!!
964053,cola050,2016-03-27 03:57:00,4,If it wasn't a 2 hour drive I'd be there for sure. I hope this show gains the interest needed to have it run for years.
