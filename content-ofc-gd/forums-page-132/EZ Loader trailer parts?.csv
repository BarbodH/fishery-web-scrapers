963268,musky666,2016-03-20 20:24:00,126,"I need to remove hubs from my tandem trailer and check brakes, bearings and refill (oil bath hubs) need to get rear seals to replace as they re almost always junk when hubs removed- anywhere local to get parts?"
963280,Big Cliff,2016-03-20 20:48:00,6899,"Sorry, where is ""Local""?"
963287,Crazy Ivan,2016-03-20 21:36:00,184,I did the same to my oil bath hubs last year. Ordered parts from ez loader.com and had them shipped here.
963289,ecmilley,2016-03-20 21:38:00,2163,"take bearings and seals to a local jobber and match them up, i use carquest in lindsay area, even canadian tire will have trailer axle kits if you know your axle diameter"
963303,OhioFisherman,2016-03-20 22:11:00,6623,Do they have NAPA auto parts stores in your area? Most auto parts store carry parts for trailers here state side.
963304,Crazy Ivan,2016-03-20 22:15:00,184,Parts for oil bath hubs are harder to find locally here. Regular grease hubs no problem. I gave up looking and ordered the correct parts online from ez-loader.com.  I remember using my trailer serial/model # to get the right size seals and races.

963344,Big Cliff,2016-03-21 08:46:00,6899,I used to work for Barrett Marketing here in Lindsay building the EZ loader trailers. I believe that Barrett closed the trailer Mfg. a few years ago but I'll check today and see if they still have a distribution or parts dept. here.
963533,Big Cliff,2016-03-22 20:23:00,6899,Did you find a source for your hub seals? I am afraid I struck out.
963558,musky666,2016-03-22 23:20:00,126,Ended up ordering online from EZ Loader...thanks anyways BC!
965258,musky666,2016-04-04 22:55:00,126,"Got parts today from Bub Bishop at EZ Loader in Spokane Washington, thanks for the help Bub!"
