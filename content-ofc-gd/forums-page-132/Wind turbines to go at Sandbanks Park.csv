965046,Oggie,2016-04-03 17:59:00,588,I have a neighbor on the Ottawa River that claims the Hydro electric dams aren't generating because the government needs to justify the need for wind and solar power. He claims the dams are allowing flow through rather than generate power that we often need to pay others to take. Now he was an employee/manager in the Hydroelectric system so is he exaggerating?

Trust me you already are and it is only going to keep getting higher.  We keep getting told to reduce our usage and save money but when we reduce our usage they aren't making enough money so they jack our rates up to compensate. When we complain they tell us to reduce our usage and the circle continues. At this rate we'll soon be paying huge hydro rates for something we give away! Oh wait, I think we already are!"
965082,SylvanOwner,2016-04-03 21:20:00,266,"Interesting thread and much thanks to Steve for helping everyone to better understand.  Something that hasn't been said here is that oil and natural gas extraction is also heavily subsidized by government and has been forever.  Why is this?  These companies make fortunes.  As far as I can tell this industry is subsidized all over the world, to varying degrees, so we do it here to be competitive.  We need exports in order to ""grow"" our economy but this is false economics in the long run.  I don't like my increasing bill any more than the next guy but I'm also surprised by what appears to be the resentment of 'green' technology as much as the resentment of the economics.  I also don't like the sound of the turbines but I like less the implications of continued use of fossil fuels.  Diversity is good.  Very good."

The figures that are published do not represent money actually given to the oil industry.  There is a lot of creative thinking about constitutes subsidies to the oil industry. E.g. the lost revenue from not billing oil companies for traffic jams is considered a subsidy to the industry; allowing the oil industry to deduct business expenses for tax purposes is considered to a subsidy.  The billions of dollars of subsidies that are reportedly given to the oil industry does not represent actual cash provided to the companies.  However, the oil industry does provide a lot of actual cash to the governments in the form of royalties and fuel taxes.  A large portion of the cost of a litre of gas is for various taxes.  http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/imfs-imagined-34-billion-silly-stats-are-behind-claims-that-canada-subsidizes-oil-industry  http://business.financialpost.com/fp-comment/terence-corcoran-the-cbcs-fossil-fuel-subsidies-folly         "

964917,Steve,2016-04-02 16:55:00,2075,"re-reading your post Cliff it appears you may believe the construction costs of these wind farms and solar farms are paid by the government (and thus, us, the tax payer).  That isn't the case.  100% of the cost of development is private dollars. The government than purchases the power (at the prices in the link above). That is where you and I, the tax payer come in.  So if your technically AGAINST green energy, you should be applauding the sites where the turbines sit idle...as the cost then is ""zero"" to the tax payer.  Of course, the only reason they sit idle is either two reasons. 1) the entire site is still under construction (which means they are the commissioning phase of development), or 2) the turbine is under maintenance / repair.  Either of those options mean power isn't being supplied to the grid, therefore, tax payers aren't paying for the power. Wind Energy is the cheapest form of renewable energy purchased by the tax payer (as show in the link above)."

I found a link (from 2013) stating that we are paying 5.2c for power from Bruce.  Has it gone up that much in three years?  http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/nuclear/bruce-power-refurbishment-implementation-agreement/amendment-april-2013  The Ontario Power Authority has completed a contract amendment to the Bruce Power Refurbishment Implementation Agreement (BPRIA). The amendment secures a cost-effective source of electricity to the end of the decade and is the first step in a commercial agreement to secure 6,300 MW at the Bruce site for the long-term. Since 2005, Bruce Power has invested about $1 billion in its four Bruce B units and, over the next five years, plans to invest an additional $1.1 billion. These investments are extending the operational lives of the units from the original end of life dates between 2016 and 2019 to between 2019 and 2020. Bruce Power will continue to receive the floor price set out in the BPRIA, currently at 5.2 cents per kilowatt-hour, which is the lowest cost generation under contract with the OPA. This amendment provides significant financial benefit to Ontario ratepayers by securing 15 percent of Ontario’s annual electricity supply from Bruce B, which is reliable, low cost and low emission baseload power to 2020, a time period when some Bruce and Darlington nuclear units are expected to be offline for refurbishing. The OPA continues to work with nuclear operators to develop a co-ordinated schedule for the 10 remaining refurbishments to secure the output at these two sites for the long-term."
964962,Steve,2016-04-02 23:09:00,2075,"no, that is the direct cost to purchase nuclear power.  however, the indirect cost includes the cost the government is contracted to purchase, due to minimum purchase requirements, which isn't actually used, but paid for.  to my knowledge the 5.2c price is a fixed price, based on a minimum purchase requirement, contracted under a power purchase agreement.  cheers,"

The only thing remotely close to that, which may be what you are referring to is, a few energy developments, prior to be installed, had confirmation from the IESO that the T&D lines would be upgraded prior to the completion of development.  The IESO failed in their commitment, resulting in the T&D lines not being able to accept the power produced (at least not during peak production time).  As a result, a court case was won which forced the IESO to pay for the power that was being generated, that could not be accepted by the grid, because of IESO not getting the T&D lines upgraded.  I believe if anyone in this country made the capital investment, then found the government, through actions not done, could not accept the power which was promised to be purchased, (through the legal binding power purchase agreement), then you would be expected to be paid for the power produced.  But this needs to be clear. The wind developers are not being paid to ""sit idle"".....the true fact is wind developers want to be paid for what they are actually generating.

Nuclear Energy is the lowest cost to produce. However, the highest cost to build and maintain. Pure production though - yes, the cheapest to produce.  Nuclear Energy will always provide base load energy to the grid. My best friend, who is an operator at Bruce, is not the slightest bit concerned about wind and solar.

965023,KLINKER,2016-04-03 14:37:00,256,"Sept 2013  Global       Energy Minister Bob Chiarelli says the system operator can now order wind producers not to generate power, and will pay them — just as it pays Bruce nuclear — not to produce electricity when it’s not needed. He says they are paid at a reduced rate that will save the province $200 million a year just on the wind turbines.  They might have stopped because I thought there was something in the news recently in the last week or two about starting to pay turbines not to produce. The idea being better to pay the producers not to produce than having to pay someone to take the power or selling cheaper than production cost.  Comparing wind turbines to the  the Bruce plant deal is comparing one bad idea to another."
