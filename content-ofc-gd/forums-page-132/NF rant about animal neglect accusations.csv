961385,Pigeontroller,2016-03-07 22:01:00,2793,Your neighbor is nuts.  But aren't you the same person that lets his dogs fight/kill wolves...Then cries when one of these same dogs kills your cat?
961389,manitoubass2,2016-03-07 22:17:00,11391,What the hell does that have to do with anything?  Do you have a point or are you just being a peach?

I might get my treaty 3 cop buddy to escort me over there with a peace offering, like big cliff suggested. Bury the hatchet so to speak.

961482,Sinker,2016-03-08 16:33:00,8692,"I just moved to this place in June. Only have one neighbour, and they are total country folks who fish and hunt as much as I do. They also like to have a good time, so we get along great. WE have already spend a weekend at their cottage. Great people. We are very lucky. Bad neighbours suck.  S."
961498,Big Cliff,2016-03-08 20:33:00,6899,"In most cases you have to be a good neighbor to have a good neighbor. It doesn't happen very often but occasionally you will run into those people that hate the world, when you do, you have a bad neighbor no matter what you do!  Shane, I'd love to have you for a neighbor anytime, you catch em, I'll clean and cook em and you'll be called ""big sinker"" in no time LOL."

963989,ch312,2016-03-26 04:55:00,1590,"Thanks cliff right back atcha!  See my thing is, just with the cats, is that in my mind you just walk the cat home and ask politelly if I can keep my cat off her property. To which I would respond""absolutely, sorry about any inconvenience I might have caused you""  That and her cat sleeps in my shed all the time lol. I dont mind its not harming anything. Its just found a cozy winter spot  In others peoples minds, responsible pet owners keep their pets under control on their own property where they don't annoy neighbors and/or kill wildlife to satisfy their inner desire to kill for fun. This tends to avoid conflict, keeps the pet safe, and everyone is happy. I cannot understand how people who allow their animals to roam at large can even begin to complain about disgruntled neighbors.   Don't want to be bothered with this sort of stuff? Control your animals. It doesn't get much simpler than that."
963991,manitoubass2,2016-03-26 05:04:00,11391,  Same as the complaining neighbours dog
963992,manitoubass2,2016-03-26 05:09:00,11391,Only time our dogs were lets loose is in the country. They didnt hurt a thing that was not threatining.  You ever wanna eat good head over for some deer(thats what our dogs eat)

I'm not a fan of letting cats wander however there's a right way to bring the ""problem"" to your attention and that comment sure wasn't the right way.  It's a good thing you're being reasonable if she tried that with the bad neighbours I've had she'd be biting off a lot more than she can chew.  Good neighbours pick their battles and a wandering cat isn't worth the battle. IMO."

No big deal just a minor inconvenience(till the next time)  Pigeontroller, just skip over it if you dont like my posts? or just post some bitter stuff, whatever you like mah man!"

It doesn't get much simpler than that.   Ummm. They are all chained up.  You start the thread by saying it was a nice day so you let the cat out, I say you should control your animals, and you respond by saying they're all chained up? Odd, a cat is not considered an animal where you live? Weird.  Big deal? Maybe not to you, but it might be for your neighbors who have to pickup your cats crap out of their gardens, garbage after mr. kitty ripped open a garbage bag for a snack or pay for damages your animal may cause.  Do you know anything about huskies?  I thought we were having a discussion about your cat wandering the neighborhood?     I know I'm a bit late replying, but I've been busy lately. Your new thread about vehicle problems reminded me of this as it was likely your ticked off neighbor who did something to your vehicles. FYI, the SPCA doesn't hold stray cats for very long and it would be fully legal for your neighbor to live trap your cat on her property. The trap can be in plain sight and there is not a legal thing you could do to stop her from trapping and taking the animal to the SPCA where it would be destroyed after a short waiting period, if you didn't claim the animal."
961190,manitoubass2,2016-03-07 01:14:00,11391,"Today, a picture of our cat pops on on facebook as missing, by a lady that lives 2 doors down?  My 14 year old daughter goes to get our cat and the lady reams her out about animal abuse/neglect and sends her on her way shouting""this is private property! Im calling the police!""  So needless to say she comes home in tears.  Wife is furious, walks over with my 1 month old son bundled on her shoulder to see what the issue is and to get our cat back.  Same response, except this time she says your being charged for trespassing. While my wife is walking away! Then she yells this gem, ""whats in that sling? Another darn cat? Move back to the rez where you can do whatever the __ you wanna do with animals""!  Are you friggen kidding me?  Needless to say OPP returned our cat and pressed no charges.  What is with some people? It was plus 12 and we let the cat out. Big deal!  Now, because of protocal the SPCA I think its called has to follow up with us about animal abuse claims.  Frig. What a waste of time and tax payers money"

Yeah, its just not a good truck  So we are chatting abit more about the situation, i apologized for the inconvenience, said im sure you have better thing to do?  Not really! I hope it stays quiet this week cause i go on vaca next week.  I said well i hope the weather stays like this! Now watch itll go to minus 30!  Crap, sorry i said that, is your truck made of wood?

961338,Big Cliff,2016-03-07 19:29:00,6899,"OK, a little from both sides of the fence: First of all from everything I do know about you I can't ever see you abusing anything be it animal or human but not everyone has had the opportunity to read your posts over the same period of time that I have. Admittedly my opinion is based on only what I have read that you have written, it could be scewed because I have no body language or facial expressions to work with but my gut tells me you are a person that I would like to spend time with!  Now from a different perspective: we have a neighbor that has a beautiful golden lab and two cats. They let the lab out and forget about him, it isn't uncommon to see him waundering the roads and he often shows up at our door (he seems to have taken a liking to us and especially to me, well, I kind of like him too and will admit to giving him ear and belly rubs  .  Thing is, not everyone likes him around here, some of our new neighbors are afraid of him (he is pretty big). River wouldn't hurt a flee but some of these people don't know that and River doesn't understand! All I have to say is ""old man mode River"" and he settles right down and just sits beside me. Further more he likes to walk the road and there have been a few times where people have had to slam on their brakes because of him, many of us are afraid he is going to get run over one of these days.  Their two cats also wander free; I have spent thousands of dollars on our landscaping and it kind of bothers me to see one of their cats digging in my garden to do it's business. I have lots of birds and chipmunks around here too, well until the cats come around. Now it is true that the chipmunks do dig holes in my garden but they are burring sunflower seeds not poop. That one is a little easier to take, I chose to give the chipmunks the sunflower seeds.  I am not trying to defend your neighbor, her attitude stinks and she needs an awakining but lettting your animals run on someone esles property isn't always fair either. There is a saying that ""strong fences does good neighbors make"". Sad that it has to be that way but there is some truth to it."

961363,manitoubass2,2016-03-07 21:15:00,11391, Never thought of that option lol  Darn dogs are too human friendly lol
961377,Big Cliff,2016-03-07 21:37:00,6899,"Well, maybe a walk down there and apologize for your cat and family bothering her. Explaning that there is a cat very similar to hers that likes to visit your property but if it isn't hers you might have to shoot it because it could be carrying any sort of who knows what. Tell her that you haven't shot it because you thought it was hers and ask her if she thinks you should just shoot it or call the SPCA? I would be very surprised if she doesn't ""appreciate"" you coming for a visit!  Three years ago I had a neighbor that wanted to sue me because there was a storm that destroyed my boat house which ended up on it's side. It took the insurance company two weeks to get here and assess the damage. He wanted to sue me because it interfeared with his enjoyment of the view of the lake. (I have the paperwork to prove it) Fortunatly he has since moved! Neighbors can be wonderful but they can also be a real pain!"
