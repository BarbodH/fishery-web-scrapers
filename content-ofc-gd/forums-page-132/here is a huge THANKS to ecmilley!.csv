I had to drive from Lindsay to Whitby and back today to take my kids back to my ex's place (130 KM round trip).  I did the breaks yesterday to discover the drivers rear caliper is going...  Well by time I got to Port Perry I could feel it going badly...  Pulled over and sure as can be it was!  I had to get the kids home and the ex was not willing to meet me where I was (so I was not to cause too much more damage to my Ram and my kids safety) I had to drive on to Whitby...  I made the call to ecmilley to ask where to grab a part (on a SUNDAY no less!!!) and he said he had one for his own truck.  So I limp the truck home as best I could...  Not only did he come and deliver the caliper (brand new and not a refurb!) he had at home for his truck but he did the install too!  We were done and ready in no time too! Now I have to get him one in return is all. So when those that don't know him as I and others do and read his posts about anything mechanical trust me when I say the following.  He DOES KNOW HIS STUFF and ISN'T a web surfer for the answer! SOLID FRIEND and Mechanic!  Thanks again bud!!!"
