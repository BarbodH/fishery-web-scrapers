Thanks for a great entertaining day talking to my friends here on the OFC. Mr. Dunker and myself should have a flapping contest.   Dunker my lips are sealed or your secret lure  . Gota give Brian & Terry credit for making the long trec. My arm was sore after carrying all Bruce's jiggs around, thanks Bruce, those jiggs will get a workout. Going to bring a security guard next time, buddy's trying to shoplift from my bag of good deals  . I had a super day, ended the day at the 477 Wing for all you can eat Fish&Chips.

AM. Plus my wheelchair is in to switch the winter tires. I really was pissed off when I woke and tried to get out of bed. Maybe a spring GTG? I know a guy that has an aquarium out back of his place where we can watch the Bass and Carp spawn. It really is something to see guys."
