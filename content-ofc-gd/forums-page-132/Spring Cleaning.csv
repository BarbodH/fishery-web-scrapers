965110,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-04 00:13:00,10439,Was working on some home brew yesterday and while it was a cookin' decided it was the perfect time to clean and organize the rod and gun room (AKA bunkhouse for transient fishermen)  at casa de Drifter. Took the whole day but it was worth the effort.      Back to the lake next week.
965117,buick14,2016-04-04 00:54:00,741,Super awesome setup but dayum look at all that empty wall space...the thousand rods you have in the corner called me to tell you they want to be on a Rod holder(s)....especially that one bent like a cross-bow
965121,DRIFTER_016,2016-04-04 01:13:00,10439,"The place is a rental, can't be screwing rod holders all over the place. I straightened the jig stick out after I took the pic."
965150,wormdunker,2016-04-04 09:58:00,1711,I've been following your cabin build.  A guy with your talent - wouldn't take much to build a floor standing rack to display those lovely rods.  Giver!
965158,Dara,2016-04-04 12:20:00,3052,You need a bigger boat
965169,Mike Pike,2016-04-04 13:31:00,1332,A place for everything and everything in its place.  Tidying up my tackle room isn't hard.  The hard part is keeping it that way!  lol
965170,misfish,2016-04-04 13:44:00,29133,"LOL I thought I was the only guy with corners packed with rods like that. It,s no wonder I don't know what I have or need. LOL"
965194,wormdunker,2016-04-04 17:13:00,1711,"Yup a place for everything!  With the not so nice fishing weather I spent a full day & 1/2 organizing my gear.  I have a rather large cupboard for all my trays, extra reels, line, insect repellant, fish scent etc.  If I hadn't used it in 3 or 4 years that stuff goes into a clear plastic tote, then up into my loft.  Then I reorganized all my trays (about 20).  Rapala stick baits in 1, mepps spinners in another, Williams wablers in one, Live Target in one & so on.  6 rods in a rack mounted in the ceiling, 8 other rods in another ceiling rack.  I own 14 rods & refuse to purchase more.  I don't care about the wonderful new rods they have out to lure in fisherman.  What am I gonna do? - leave my old favourites at home??  Nope!  I have 3 older favourite rods that go in the boat at all times.  1 is about 35 years old, a 6' Browning paired with a Cardinal 3 - has caught everything from perch, bass, pike, a 7 lb walleye & a 48"" Musky.  It goes in the boat & I use it on a regular basis.  Then I got to the shelf which stores my fishing lines.  22 spools from 2 lb - 30 lb braid.  Found some older ones dating back to 2007.  I filed them in the recycle bin.  I'm not opposed to keeping line dated 3 or 4 years ago as long as it was store in a cool dark place such as my tackle cupboard.   After organizing my tackle, I started checking my outdoor clothing.  I tucked away my snowmobile boots, checked jackets & rain gear for wear & tear.  This closet is 12' long.  Last inventory, I have 31 jackets, hoodies, winter parkas, floater suit etc.  Not buying any more!  We presently have 4"" of new snow so I've been pulling down 1 rod at a time - cleaning, lube reels, checking line."

Drift I'm not much of a betting man anymore but I'll give you 10 to 1 you are a single guy. If I told my wife that the room was after I straightened it up she would tell me to do it again. She is a 6 foot blond with an Austrian/Russian background, I do as I am told or I shall suffer badly, the pillow alone would get me a week in the ""cooler"". Ya vole mine Capitan.  I think it looks just dandy."
