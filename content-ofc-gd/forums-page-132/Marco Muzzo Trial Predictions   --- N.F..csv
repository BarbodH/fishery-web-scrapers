Chris u raised a good point ,,,,but at some point in this world someone has to judge those that have been irresponsible  for taking innocent lives, wether it be date rape drugs, guns, vehicles  boats etc.  if u kill someone who was innocent then u deserve to expect u will do serious prison time, and if the judges had the balls to enforce the true laws of this land then maybe this crap would not be allowed to continue to happen, lest we forget the maggots who were street racing up the 400 who took out my neighbour , a truck driver just south of Innisfil a few years ago and yes we went to his funeral and took baked goods over to their home after the service... the judges are invisible and only care to make soft decisions so they dont upset the apple cart so they inturn make huge amounts of money so they can retire peacefully, i could go on but i wont"

If he had not paid his taxes he would have got more. He will be out in what 3 or 4 and then he doesn't need to drive, that's what chauffeurs are for. I really hope he has a great time on the range. I'm sure there is a welcoming party awaiting him. His family is going to have to pay off every gang where ever he ends up.

So if the survivors get it all plus 10 or more, again that isn't going to bring any one back.  Sadly cash is the one thing Muzzo's family reportedly has lots of.

That is a fact. I remember a W5 program they did 20 or more years ago when they interview, can I say Black?, inmates that crossed the border from Detroit to rob a few banks from Sarnia to London out of Detroit that said they never lived in better conditions in their lives than our min security prisons because there wasn't room in Kingston. BBq's, TV's with cable, stereos, a veggie garden, putting green, pool table, 3 men for 3 bedroom condo, weekends off, I'll never forget that. All inclusive destination? Worksworth G&CC. They said they never had better living conditions and if they stayed for life it would be better than living home with 12 in a 2 bedroom apt. They chose Canada in case they got convicted."

When I was a young man, drinking and driving was commonplace. Younger people are much more responsible about drinking and driving now than they were 30 years ago. Yes todays kids are a million times more responsible then my generation was. Throw a box of beer in the back seat of the car and away we go!!!!  Drinking and driving  was pretty much an every weekend practice from age 16-21 when I was growing up. My daughter rarely drinks and I've never seen her drunk. My son will bend elbow's to excess but will phone a cab or a none drinking friend....EVERY TIME. Much more responsible then I was at that age. Must have something to do with his mother's parenting skills."
957611,muddler,2016-02-13 17:43:00,623,"The difference between then (when we were kids) and now is that there is a pile of information about drinking and driving now. Heck, remember when we all smoked because it was cool and wouldn't hurt ya. In the 60's Toronto stopped at Sheppard AVE. Newmarket was the boonies back then. And drinking and driving was considered 'fun', mostly because you could backroad it home and never see another car.  Today there is so much traffic in and around the GTA that i is impossible to go anywhere any time and NOT run into traffic. With all the advertisements by MAAD and the senseless carnage caused  by drunk drivers, I am still amazed that anyone would be that stupid. We should employ Swedish type laws for drunk driving. They are really strict,  0.02% (up to 6 months imprisonment), 0.10% (imprisonment, maximum 2 years). They also through in a fine.  That's for the first offence, it gets worse after that. If you get into an accident or kill someone while driving drunk, well I am told that it's very severe punishment and none of that Bull that the driver is the sole provider/bread winner to lower the sentence. You are treated as a criminal.  Why anyone would drive after drinking is beyond me. The consequences of their actions can NEVER be undone. Lock them up and throw away the key.   muddler"

However my son moved out at the tender age of 21...never took a dime from Mom and Dad that wasn't to be paid back.  Put himself through college and bought a house while working PT and going to school full time. And still calls a cab on his own dime if he decides to come over after work...we are within walking distance of his branch at work... and share a few bottles of wine with mom and dad when his significant other is working until 11PM and a go train ride away in Yorkdale.And BTW he is 26 an still doesn't own his first vehicle.  Far cry from my days at that age. I wish I was the man he is today back when I was that age.
957721,irishfield,2016-02-14 06:03:00,26272,"I hear yah Steve.. when my father would be lecturing me (in 1981 or so) about the open beer left between the seats of the 'Bee parked behind the house, I would sway the conversation by asking him who the hell parked his car??.. at least mine was straight in it's spot!  A different time for sure and maybe me telling such stories of my misguided youth over the years kept my 3 kids on the straight and narrow. That and knowing Mom or Dad were more than willing to pick them up if need be, but they have never driven impaired to the best of my knowledge (of course my Mother would say the same about me!).  As for giving them cab money.. not a friggin chance. I was married at 20, and my kids can pay their own way through life just as I did after getting married with $13 bucks in my bank account. Leah had a grand and her mother froze her bank account!  All that said and with the Muzzo family money some might be correct that he'll never come back for sentencing, but his grandfather worked hard to get where he is and I suspect the family will be certain to make Marco make things as right as they can be for all involved."
957724,crappieperchhunter,2016-02-14 06:41:00,2582,Yes Wayne...way way different times. However the troubling thing I see now is parents not being parents...but rather Best friends. Your kid screws up. So instead of teaching them right from wrong you forgive them and excuse there behaviour. What the hell have there learned about consequence from that? I was charged with impaired at 17. Took me to a jail in Guelph and called my folks. My old man said  I will come and get him in the  morning. Spent the night in jail listening to a hard core drunk puking up his guts in the 5X10 cell next to me. Contemplated suicide rather then facing my folks in the morning. But they are smart. When they threw me in the cell they made me take my belt AND my shoes/shoe laces off.  It was HARSH...really HARSH for a 17 year old...but I learned. Perhaps I scared the crap out of my kids by sharing that experience with them. Put I'm sure glad i did.  I can't comment on the Muzzo family. I can only look at it through the eyes of my own life experiences and wish it had turned out better for everyone involved.

Sure, he was obviously distressed, given what he did on the streetcar before the cops arrived. But when the car was empty, cops everywhere, they stood in the doorway, with the doors open, demanding that he comply with their orders. Seems to me to be pretty obvious that he was under the influence and as such, he should have been handled differently. Why not simply shut the streetcar doors (you can do that with the switch under the sign at the front of the car) and wait for a supervisor with a taser to arrive and taser him? Surely the number of cops at the scene could have easily over-powered this kid, but instead, he gets shot 9 times!!!!! Either the cop was messed up himself or his training was woefully inadequate.

956161,manitoubass2,2016-02-04 23:18:00,11391,Well it certainly sounds like he should take his punishment.  Why only 12 years?  Thats odd imo  Is the the accused underage or something?  Killing 4 people and getting 12 years is surely the punishment not fitting the crime
956172,ketchenany,2016-02-04 23:53:00,3229,"MB he is 29 years old, his grandfather started a drywall company and amassed a fortune through hard work and good business sense, he has had the best of everything all his life. My question in all of this is you get off a company jet and then drive, he could have had every Limo lined up to pick him up and drive him home. These guys helped build SkyDome!  Personally, I have seen kids with wealthy parents make stupid mistakes in judgement, thinking it will not happen to them and ruined them.  I have four grown kids and so far they have been at their best, they have kids of their own and hope they guide them to not get into trouble."

I have a feeling his parents are telling him to fall on his sword and take whatever the crown gives him. Very rarely does Greenspan not go to trial Seriously not to take this thread off topic but why should there be any difference if an impaired person ends up killing innocent people with a vehicle or an impaired person grabs his gun and kills people running through a bush or land that is public property the penalty should be the same , regardless of what the person who was impaired used to take an innocent life, the families that have lost someone thru actions of a person that has been impaired are lasting for a lifetime, at some point the govt and judges have to send a message out that this behaviour is not going to be tolerated, but sadly some people in the decision making process dont want to ruffle to many feathers because they want that paycheck. some dont like to stand out and take a stand imho There were no loop holes, no police, no lawyers there when the incident happened, just black and white facts , someone chose to drive drunk without caring about anyone else on the road, but guess what , some others were on the road doing things legally, and now they are not here, it is time the judges and politicians come out of puberty and stand up for the rights of the good guys who are becoming victims"

There is the difference in penalties.  With this kid, after the weekend he had. I am a bit suprised Greenspan didn't get him off on being too intoxicated to make any decision but the family is making him do the time for what he did.  I of course have no real insight as to what is happening.  2 to 1 for time served before conviction I would think is why he never looked for bail before too, because he knew darn well there would be time involved"

Forcillo is a psychopath, Muzzo is a spoiled, irresponsible idiot.  Lots of high profile trials, Cosby, Gomeshi, the Dan Blasthma trial, but I have a hunch the injustice is coming in the Forcillo trial, even with a decent video of the disgusting incident."

He is saving the family of the victims a trial, and I know people want him to get hammered, but that counts for something in my books. I feel for the Muzzo family as well, it's terrible for everyone. It goes to show how one poor decision can change things forever. How many of us can really cast stones at the guy when it comes to getting behind the wheel after having  more to drink than you should have?  When I was a young man, drinking and driving was commonplace. Younger people are much more responsible about drinking and driving now than they were 30 years ago."

He's not getting one in the leg or arm and look what the back stop would be, someone's house. So if you're comfortable taking a shot that could enter someone's house and kill their child go ahead."

The monthly court appearances kept getting postponed because the lawyers were looking for any holes in how the Police and Forensic staff handled everything. When nothing was found to get him off they then started the back room negotiations.  If the judge gives him anything less than 5 years then shame on our court system.  This is all just speculation on my part, so don't take it as gospel."

956130,mr blizzard,2016-02-04 21:13:00,1589,"The appeal process will be lengthy too Totally agree with you,,,there are some overseas countries as reported by the news some time ago where if u are convicted of impaired driving it is an automatic 6 month jail term, the sad part is the judges need to come down much harder on sentencing in this country where there is a conviction of impaired driving causing death.  The message has to be the same coast to coast to coast that if you do that crime you will definitely do the time, and not just be given a minimal penalty.  The persons life that an impaired driver took away was worth more than a couple of years, if the judges had the nerve to be unanymous and send out a clear message that if you are convicted of that offence this is the time you will be in jail, no ifs ands or buts not all but some people would not make that mistake  No family should ever have to endure a loss or losses like that and for the person that did it they should stay in prison for a long, long, long time"
