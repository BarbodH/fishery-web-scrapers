No need to head out deep or far off shore. Your Lund will be fine in the salt. You need to give it a thorough rinse inside and out as well as the trailer and flushing the engine and washing your tackle after each trip though.  "

963824,Fisherman,2016-03-24 20:17:00,7201,"If the bearings have been freshly re-packed they should go tens of thousands of miles without issue just like the back wheels on your front wheel drive car do (some cars go their whole life with no service on the rear bearings but they aren't in and out of the water like a boat trailer).  That said and trailer bearings being what they are, I carry a whole hub assembly which can be changed in minutes with nothing more than a pair of pliers.  They  only cost a little more than a bearing kit but are waaaaay easier to change on the road. Just make sure you get the right bolt pattern with the right bearing & seal diameters (that's a little bit of experience speaking....).    Good Luck!!

964247,jedimaster,2016-03-28 23:27:00,3472,"Have towed my boat from New Jersey to Toronto and fem Toronto to Georgia/South Carolina and back and will be headed to Arkansas in a few weeks. Pull the caps off your bearing hubs and check the grease. If it's really dirty or weird looking consider pulling the bearings out and re packing them or just replacing them. As others said any time you stop immediately check your wheels to see if they are hot. You will know what too hot is. Make sure your tire pressure is right. And if you are passing through different climates re check the tire pressure when the tire are cold. Eg 40psi at Toronto -5 temps can be big trouble in Florida +30 temps and vice versa. Keep an extra wheel but, a replacement bearing, greese, nut wrench, a jack that will reach and lift your wheel. A good place to check your tow vehicles jack is in the driveway because finding out it doesn't have enough lift is not so fun when you have everything else on the side of a highway in -10 in snow. Check your lights whenever you stop. Things can shake loose. Have a lock for your tongue and your receiver."

964287,Ron,2016-03-29 02:35:00,1683,"One thing no one seemed to have mentioned... Crack the lug nuts at home to make sure you can take them off if you are on the road and have to change a tire.

A couple of questions for you guys:  1) Has anyone towed boat this far and what should I be watching out for. Towing vehicle is a Buick Enclave. 2) Does anyone have an opinion on whether I should sell the boat here and then buy another one down south, or simply tow it to the U.S?  Thanks in advance!  "

963688,grimsbylander,2016-03-23 19:56:00,3016,"Does your Enclave have a transmission cooler? Will you have the boat loaded with goods you're moving with you? Watch the weight! That'll add quick to the stress over that distance.  As far as selling vs taking it with you, that's tough to say, depends on the boats current age and value. If your moving there, I'll assume you're going to be working there and getting paid in USD. If not, and you'll be buying a boat with converted cash from CDN dollars, bad idea. You'd be selling in CDN and buying in USD - wrong direction!  Where you going btw? Wait until Trump get elected and you'll get a good deal on a house from the people moving to Canada! LOL"

I will try not to load anything on the boat or the Enclave when towing. The move is due to a change in work and will be paid in USD. I am moving to North Carolina (RTP region). Not sure how the fishing will be there though, they don't have as many lakes as we do here."

963743,bigbuck,2016-03-24 12:22:00,2449,"Trailers are made to be towed. Check out all the fasteners, lights, make sure the bearings are adjusted correctly and are greased, the tires are in good shape, the trailer brakes work if applicable, you have a spare tire, jack and correct tire wrench and a spare set of bearings and you are good to go. It will take you 2-3 hours to get it ready. When you stop for gas, check the hubs, if they are HOT to the touch, there is a problem, warm is ok but not so hot that you cannot hold your finger to them. If that happens, you will need to pull off the wheel and inspect for damage then repack the bearings with grease and reinstall correctly. Youtube is your friend with this."

I carry a small air compressor with me to top off the tires (Truck and Trailer) whenever needed. As others have mentioned, I do a walk-around at each stop and make sure all is well and that the bearings are not over-heating. In all the years making these trips, I've never had an issue.  I do need to pick up some spare trailer light bulbs."
