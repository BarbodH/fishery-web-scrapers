965161,pics,2016-04-04 12:47:00,1268,I picked up some jigs from bigugli.. good prices and quality..it was tough to spend much time talking with anyone due to the crowds..lol
965162,pics,2016-04-04 12:56:00,1268,There was a guy with a Savage .17 hmr rifle.. It was priced right but I lost the his phone number..lol.. Turns out the bassmasters didn't think it was appropriate for a fishing swap meet and escorted him out. They were going to call the police but other than maybe breaking one of their rules the guy didn't do anything illegal. I can see him being told to put it away but to almost call the police shows how ignorant people can be towards a gun...
