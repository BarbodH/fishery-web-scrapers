959818,netminder,2016-02-26 14:41:00,514,The Facebook requirement can only work in my favour. Keep the old-timers and tinfoil-hat types out of the contest!
959822,solopaddler,2016-02-26 15:30:00,8605,"The Facebook requirement can only work in my favour. Keep the old-timers and tinfoil-hat types out of the contest!  Maybe so, you could be right about that.  On a contest related note I received word from both Eppinger Lures this morning as well as St. Croix Rods. Eppinger will be providing a substantial prize package of lures including a suitable array of Husky Devle and Husky Junior spoons for the contest winner. They are a staple for big lake trout in the far north. St. Croix will be donating a suitable St. Croix Premier casting rod, most likely a light musky stick as it would suit the fishing that will be encountered best. Almost certainly it will be the 8' M/H stick, model  PM80MHF."
959823,AKRISONER,2016-02-26 15:33:00,5558,entered and spread the link!  cant pass up on the slight chance at the opportunity of a lifetime that I would never ever have the chance to fulfill on my own. Unreal.
959825,solopaddler,2016-02-26 15:44:00,8605,"entered and spread the link!  cant pass up on the slight chance at the opportunity of a lifetime that I would never ever have the chance to fulfill on my own. Unreal.  Excellent, thanks! I'm a bit biased but I agree it's a great opportunity. This is probably worth mentioning. Corey Myers is the head guide at Frontier and will be the person guiding both myself and whoever wins. Typically I hate being guided myself, but this time it's cool. I've gotten to know Corey quite well over the last few months and can honestly say he is a genuinely nice young man and incredibly enthusiastic! He also knows the lake inside out. There is zero doubt on my part that spending a week with him will be a huge plus and a lot of fun!"
959826,bigugli,2016-02-26 15:58:00,6138, Sure as long as you agree to be the Cabin Boy. We need someone to cater to our every whim. Just make sure he leaves the fibreglass at home.

959913,chris.brock,2016-02-27 00:16:00,4053,I just can't picture Borger in the front of the boat. I'm guessing Cory won't last 2 days before you throw him overboard.

Thanks for the vote of confidence LOL! Personally I can't picture Brock guiding anyone unless it's to the beer store so I guess we're even.

Radical atheist's get one extra entry! But only after sending in 100 box tops from Ezekiel Golden Flax.       If you figure out how to delete a facebook account let me know  It's actually pretty easy to do. Or at least inactivate it. It's all there in settings.  Well, I never win anything but if you ain't got a ticket you ain't got a chance. That's the spirit Cliff!"

959572,solopaddler,2016-02-25 14:33:00,8605,Im not allowed to have facebook ! Why? Are you in prison?  Get a friend to enter for you and have him / her gift you the prize. That's not allowed unfortunately.
959575,solopaddler,2016-02-25 14:47:00,8605,"For what it's worth I pushed hard to make this a straight draw and totally free. The Facebook aspect was a direct request from Frontier Lodge - they wanted to boost their presence on Facebook and I thought it was a reasonable request.  Some people have complained to me privately about the Facebook thing. All I can say is I'm trying my best guys. I do try to please everyone, but it's not always possible."
