I would say that as of daylight this morning until now (about 3:00 pm) the water level has risen about 3"". It isn't far off the highest I have seen it in 16 years. Fortunatly they aren't calling for much rain in the next week which should help let things catch up a bit."

964830,Big Cliff,2016-04-01 19:40:00,6899,"Naw, water temperatures still way too cold and the water up until the last two days has been way to low for the crappie to move into the shallow areas. This cold front moving in is going to put them off their feed and it looks like it will be at least another two weeks before things start to warm up. The crappie won't even start to get active until we start to see water temperatured of at least 52°F and in my experience the most productive range is 58-62°F. We need some bright sunny days to start to warm up those shallow bays then we'll see some action."
964831,Big Cliff,2016-04-01 19:43:00,6899,"BTW Paul I am thinking the answer is no for the docks this weekend, high water, high wind, not much point in pushing it!

963284,fishindevil,2016-03-20 20:57:00,6254,It's about a 1 mile swath from the marina to our govt dock in thurstonia  on sturgeon lake !!! It has happened many times before and people just leave their wooden docks out and some years it's fine others they get crushed I knew it was going to happen last week when we had that major wind/hail storm blow through it only took about 20 mins for the ice to do all that damage !!!!! Peoples water lines are ripped out and even the marina wall looks like it's gonna collapse they just repaired it from last years ice event and it's wrecked again !!! A lot of those peoples docks are cottagers so they have no idea yet they are destroyed and there is gonna be lots of debris out on the water when it melts as all that stuff will be floating all over the lake as usual be careful first few times out and watch for things all depends on the wind again and how fast the water comes up

That ice has lots of room to pick up momentum.

I'm very close to the water (ice) here so of course I had to invest the 12 steps or so to stand at the shore and listen to the symphony. Of course I had to stick my toe on the new ice - where it was water yesterday - and found almost 3/4"" had reformed.
