We had heard that the water temps had got into the 70s meaning the bigger sharks were starting to move. After getting skunked the first two nights we set out again the third. Right at sunset, I had a good run but set the hook too soon. An hour after that another bait got picked up and the fight was on. Thirty minutes later I had my biggest shark to date on the beach, a lemon over 8'. The next night I put my buddy on his first shark. We also lost something huge to a broken line. The video of the catches is here:    Now it's on to walleye season back here in Canada on the Detroit River!"
964998,manitoubass2,2016-04-03 04:10:00,11391,Hahahaha holy crap I cannot imagine the fight(and fear of the fish???)
965001,Rich Clemens,2016-04-03 11:45:00,3131,HA Ha.   And I worry about the Muskie teeth.  Congrats on your PB.
965014,SirCranksalot,2016-04-03 13:25:00,3291,Sheesh. Don't tell me you were wading in those waters!!
965016,Gallie,2016-04-03 13:31:00,1215,Nice shark man!
965017,Big Cliff,2016-04-03 13:40:00,6899,I really enjoyed watching that! Thanks for sharing!
965032,PBenson,2016-04-03 15:49:00,154,"Thanks guys.  SirCranksAlot... I only swim in the ocean if it's clear, waist deep water. And never at sunset haha."
965036,smitty55,2016-04-03 16:19:00,928,Pretty neat. What do you use to get your bait out?  Cheers
965039,Acountdeleted,2016-04-03 16:58:00,2562,Woah! Such a cool experiance!
965041,manitoubass2,2016-04-03 17:15:00,11391,I wonder the same? Is it live bait and let it swim out?  Maybe im dumb but seems youde have to have the bait out at least 100 yards or so?  Or does it drop off deeper?
965043,Steve,2016-04-03 17:34:00,2075,i think the sharks come into 6' of water or less in the evenings and at night.  maybe uses kittens and lets them swim out  :)   edit: in the video you can see them bringing the baits out via kayak...or at least it looks like it....love it!!!!
965081,PBenson,2016-04-03 21:18:00,154,"Yes, I use a kayak to bring the baits out anywhere from 150-500 yards. It depends on the beach but a lot of the time the further the better. For bait, anything fresh and bloody usually works. Sometimes if I see another angler catch a fish he's going to release I'll ask him for it and kayak it out hooked live. I use a 8oz spider weight to keep it on the bottom in one place."

I'm offended by your 'Kittens' comment.
965089,aplumma,2016-04-03 22:14:00,6896,Nice trip we shark fish usually from a boat and let a chumm line bring them in. The sharks will be as shallow as the surf line in alot of cases getting the fishes that are disorientated in the white wash. I have seen them finning along the sand and ocean edges in 1 ft of water.   Art
965281,PBenson,2016-04-05 01:22:00,154,"Oh ya, I've caught 5 foot sharks on casted baits before the first sandbar"
965287,FishFinder17,2016-04-05 01:53:00,139,"Really cool video, thanks for sharing.  Getting those hooks out doesn't look easy!"
965334,PBenson,2016-04-05 17:23:00,154,Yeah I usually spend about 25 seconds trying and if I can't I just cut the hook. They will rust out after a few days so it's safer for the fish that way.
