965035,mike rousseau,2016-04-03 16:13:00,4661,Pumping increased the chances of giving the fish slack... Also your constantly changing the pressure on the hook which can cause it to tear a bigger hole and not only increase chances of losing a fish but increase the damage done to the fish...  Also I personally find with large fish if they feel a pressure decrease (when you drop your tip to reel) they understand it as an opportunity to get away and they run and head shake and go crazy again increasing the chance of losing your fish...  I agree if your drag is slipping you'll have to rod pump but if that's the case your reel isn't up to the job in my opinion... Most of my reels I use for any species are capable of straightening the hooks with their drag... So there is never a situation where I need to rod pump... Me lure will fail before my reel...  Now I'm talking freshwater here... A 500lb tuna may be different...
964333,hunteronwheels,2016-03-29 17:37:00,112,i am curious if the rod i use for flipping would be ok for muskie as i only get to a muskie lake once in a bluemoon its a ABU GARCIA VERITAS TORO CASTING rod 
964336,Raf,2016-03-29 18:18:00,3495,it should be fine
964337,hunteronwheels,2016-03-29 18:23:00,112,ok cool thanks
964345,Tom McCutcheon,2016-03-29 19:19:00,627,Yep...should be good. Just go with the heaviest braid you can. It's rated to 60.
964352,hunteronwheels,2016-03-29 19:53:00,112,thanks i was hoping so now a reel lol well i guess i can get reel i can then use it for pike as well i have 7 rod and reels but all for bass
964356,Raf,2016-03-29 19:56:00,3495,abu 6500/6501 C3 would propably be the most cost effective option.
964357,hunteronwheels,2016-03-29 19:58:00,112,i am thinking of getting the Abu Garcia Revo Toro Winch
964358,hunteronwheels,2016-03-29 20:01:00,112,abu 6500/6501 C3 would propably be the most cost effective option. i am not a fan of round reels lol ok let me be honest i only have ever used low profiles i just started using baitcasters last year
964359,Raf,2016-03-29 20:13:00,3495,toro winch will work fine too.  just a little more ca$h.  i don't know if it comes with a clicker like the C3 or not.. the c3 could also be repurposed as a trolling reel.
964376,hunteronwheels,2016-03-29 21:26:00,112,i dont troll i am a caster i get bored trolling and i fish from a kayak
964390,cram,2016-03-29 22:25:00,1733,The winch is pretty slow for a general purpose reel.  You might be happier with a reel that has less power but more speed. (ie the revo tor in HS or in 5.4:1 if you can find a used one somewhere) Just don't use the giant blades.
964392,esoxansteel,2016-03-29 22:31:00,1307,"use the reel you have, the winch is for pulling big blades, and the rod will not handle big blades, the outfit will be perfect for throwing one of my favorites the Bomber Long A Mag, some smaller rubber, ie Storms, and smaller bucktails ie 5s to maybe 7s, Super Shad Raps etc,   65 pound braid all the way   i use my flippin stick for the above baits, as they handle them more efficiently then the standard musky apparel, and will cast them a country mile if you want to bomb cast.  Definately use the low profile reel you have, with a 5.4 retrieve or higher, the Winch at 4.6 will not move those baits fast enough, unless you crank like a mad man, and will be counter productive"
964405,hunteronwheels,2016-03-29 23:26:00,112,i have a couplecurado 201 and a revo premier i didnt think they would be enough
964476,OhioFisherman,2016-03-30 17:21:00,6623,LURE RATING 4-10 ?  Is that in ounces? Or did they come up with a new way to confuse people?
964522,hunteronwheels,2016-03-30 22:03:00,112,no thats ounces lol
964553,OhioFisherman,2016-03-31 01:34:00,6623,"LOL hunter, I am certainly not a muskie man, but a ten ounce lure is a pretty darned good sized one!"
964717,Rizzo,2016-04-01 02:01:00,4754,get a clicker and troll from the kayak! good times
964758,mike rousseau,2016-04-01 13:57:00,4661,Rod sounds like it should handle the smaller spectrum of musky lures which is fine... Especially from a kayak...  As far as a reel keep in mind if you use a reel that doesn't have sufficient drag you'll be rod pumping fish in instead of cranking them in... Or the lighter drag will extend the fight which is bad news for musky when the water is warm... Just something to consider...

964812,OhioFisherman,2016-04-01 18:44:00,6623,"20# of drag is actually a lot of drag, they are only showing 15# for a Curado 300 series."
964814,hunteronwheels,2016-04-01 18:47:00,112,ya my premier by abu garcia is great for the weeds where i fish
964968,mike rousseau,2016-04-03 00:16:00,4661,That should do ok then
964971,Lape0019,2016-04-03 00:31:00,647,The local shop brought in the Daiwa Lexa 300 for that purpose. It has a higher speed than most.  The toro winch would more Han likely do it though if you can get passed the slower gear ratio

I'm not a musky fisherman but other than really small stuff I've always pumped decent sized fish in during my nearly 60 years of angling, always viewed simply cranking as a sign of a noob especially while the drag is slipping, what is the reasoning behind reeling and not pumping fighting a musky?"
