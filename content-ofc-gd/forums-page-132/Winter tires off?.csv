It feels like you just took off a pair of  rubber boots and slipped on some running shoes the first trip down the road!

It only takes me about an hour to switch them out, and they're calling for snow this weekend so I'm thinking probably wait until April.

Also, when I looked at the long-term forecast there were still quite a few subzero nights coming up....that could mean snow on the morning drive into work. Gonna hold off, do it in a couple weeks. Plus it means I can procrastinate today, have a beer, and not lug the tires out. Gonna go grab that beverage"

962517,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-14 18:51:00,8243,"I looked at the specs for my winter tires and it says they should be off when temps average 15C. I had a set of Blizzacs that came with a car I bought and didn't know or care to know they were winter tires. They lasted until mid June before a belt ripped off the tire. Lucky I was only going around 20K making a turn.  A question I have had in the past is what to do when driving to Florida in the winter every year when we had the family condo there? I would drive the car down and leave it there for Mom and Dad and fly back. I have had some pretty bad weather all the way to Georgia. Once in Florida if we left with winter tires on they would be unsafe in no time, if I had all seasons on in some really bad weather that haven't be very good either. Solution, I bought a mint 85' Buick for $750.00 and left it there for my family. Ah the good old days. Now it's the cold new days."
962565,Joeytier,2016-03-14 22:30:00,3990,"Starting Friday we're gonna a few -10 or colder nights in a row, so the winters stay on until the end of the month."

If they are not on in an accident or claim they have an avenue to deny the claim. They can't deny a claim because you don't have snows on, the worst they could do is remove the discount.  In most cases it's just a guideline, and this year common sense may be to have them off earlier."

Most years I have stuff planted in March.  Where I'm going with this is almost every year we seem to get one last substantial dumping of snow towards the end of March. It used to drive me crazy because I'd be all worried if my early planted stuff would survive....but it always has so I don't worry anymore. But for this reason alone I will leave my snows on until April.
