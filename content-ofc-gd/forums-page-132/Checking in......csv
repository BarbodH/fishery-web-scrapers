I didn't bother when I was there, but it is an option. PS remember the sign on the toilet means you can't put toilet paper in the toilet. It must be collected in the waste paper container provided."

G Get out in the water yell ""SHARK"", point out toward the open water and run like crazy for the beach, that should take care of the crowds for a while, then grab your rod and walk back into the water like a hero and comment loudly as you go ""I'll TAKE CARE OF IT!"" Oh, and you won't have to troll the bar after"
