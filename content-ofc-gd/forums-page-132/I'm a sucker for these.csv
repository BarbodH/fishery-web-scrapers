964622,wormdunker,2016-03-31 14:18:00,1711,Hey Fish Farmer.  You know I'll be searching live target at the swap meet.
964640,BillM,2016-03-31 16:59:00,17367,I love the LT smelt for early season shallow water Lake O action!
964645,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-31 17:52:00,8243,The jury is still out on the Live Target lures. I finally broke down last year and got myself a 20 buck Perch Live Target. Not even a farm animal (Sheepshead) hit it longlining for Walleye here on Erie. I'll keep trying I need to get some return on my investment. If my accountant knew I spend 20 beans on a lure she would not be happy with me.
964651,manitoubass2,2016-03-31 18:43:00,11391,I bought a few perch baits when live target first released them(I think).  They dont fish well here either. Not a tooth mark on em
964652,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-31 18:48:00,8243,And I know guys swear by them. I swear at them.
964654,manitoubass2,2016-03-31 18:52:00,11391,"Haha. Even when the bite is on heavy Ill throw them on and naddas.  Just not the lure for me...  Im sure many slay them on em though, to each their own"
964656,manitoubass2,2016-03-31 18:53:00,11391,"Like I stated before though, that lipless shiner is super productive for me, on hard water or in soft water.  Walleye bass and pike love it"
964662,206,2016-03-31 19:20:00,563,"I had bought a LT perch crank years ago and didn't get a sniff on it, I pulled it out last spring on Rice joking with a buddy about how much I had payed for the dam thing. I managed 5 eye in the next 2 hours 3 in the slot. All of a sudden its my favorite crank lol"
964672,kickingfrog,2016-03-31 19:49:00,8333,Today I noticed that the Cabela's has the saltwater sized x-rap like the ones I use at the store ( 3rd down in the photo that I posted). The price was $22.99. Don't remember what I paid when I got mine but that wasn't it.
964674,kickingfrog,2016-03-31 19:55:00,8333,"For goodness sake, its pike fishing...toss out a silver/gold williams wabbler and be done with it.   Like a lure plated with actual precious metals isn't an indulgence that isn't necessary to catch pike for goodness sakes."
964688,grimsbylander,2016-03-31 22:05:00,3016,Just when you thought $20 was an expensive lure....  http://www.ebay.com/itm/Hinkle-Shad-Golden-shiner/281985908893?_trksid=p2047675.c100011.m1850&_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIC.MBE%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20140602152332%26meid%3D579d23a949c94b5f9e36951c282c69f8%26pid%3D100011%26rk%3D5%26rkt%3D10%26sd%3D221703012509  Pick up a couple Hinkle Golden Shiner swimbaits.
964691,Joeytier,2016-03-31 22:50:00,3990,"  Like a lure plated with actual precious metals isn't an indulgence that isn't necessary to catch pike for goodness sakes. Well under half the price of most jerkbaits, and will last a lifetime.  I'd like to see a live target jerkbait after 25-30 pike lol"
964694,chris.brock,2016-03-31 23:04:00,4053,"I'm with Dara and Joey.  I'm pretty sure they don't have any LT baitball cranks (what a joke) in their boxes either, unless they were gifts."
964695,kickingfrog,2016-03-31 23:07:00,8333,Enjoy your fishin'.
964696,chris.brock,2016-03-31 23:09:00,4053,u too
964707,manitoubass2,2016-04-01 01:09:00,11391,"$400 bucks???? Is the ""silver"" made if gold????  Geebus"
964708,grimsbylander,2016-04-01 01:14:00,3016,"$400 bucks???? Is the ""silver"" made if gold?  Geebus $400USD! = $520CDN  Want the 5 pack?? LOL"
964712,manitoubass2,2016-04-01 01:39:00,11391,Ok ok so its made outta platinum lol
964716,Rizzo,2016-04-01 01:58:00,4754,"the look of it sold me a year or 2 back. I have dragged that thing around St Clair for 10 hours I bet with not a hit...while other rods all around it are going off. It looks great to me, has a great wiggle, but something just isn't doing it. Sometimes just a little off in the vibration can make it seem unnatural. Not sure how much it will swim this year....too many productive baits waiting to get chomped again while this one swims thru the water in mint condition"
964718,Dara,2016-04-01 02:08:00,3052,"the look of it sold me a year or 2 back.

964734,Gallie,2016-04-01 09:39:00,1215,"I have a couple lt perch as well and am pretty disappointed in them, only caught a couple bass on the double jointed pike trolling and thats it. X2 on the wabler and the big o love them both!"
964735,fishindevil,2016-04-01 10:16:00,6254,there is an awnswer to all that......X-RAP ghost   $12.00  :Gonefishing:
964473,kickingfrog,2016-03-30 16:55:00,8333,Had no intention of buying anything but this caught my eye.Like I needed another pike/big walleye lure.We'll see how it fishes cause they have musky sizes as well.
964474,manitoubass2,2016-03-30 17:00:00,11391,"What size is that, 6""?  I like livetaget. I use a dew of their lures.  Really like the lipless shiners"
964483,netminder,2016-03-30 18:11:00,514,"I like them too. But hot damn, $20!? I can't justify that price point."
964486,Smokercrafty,2016-03-30 18:17:00,227,"I like them too. But hot damn, $20!? I can't justify that price point. Totally agree! They may work, but after losing a few of those, I'm sure I'd switch to something cheaper.....lol"
964496,kickingfrog,2016-03-30 19:19:00,8333,"I tried to show the pen for scale. The packaging list it at 6.25 inches and 2.5 oz.  Ya, $20 isn't normally what I'd be willing to pay for a pike lure but like I said... I'm a sucker.  Suspending Husky jerks and saltwater x-raps are my go-to May-June pike lures so I might pick my spots with this one since I'm not going to have multiple colours like I do for the others."
964497,davey buoy,2016-03-30 19:25:00,5505,"Looks great,price is always there problem,I have pumpkin seed blue gill ,crappie,frogs and a couple more. I am still not convinced they catch more then my 3/8 white Big O . That IMO is the best lure for bass,pike bowfin as well. Many more say,and @ $6.99 most places,what a great value . ,"
964498,AKRISONER,2016-03-30 19:43:00,5558,"wasnt totally sold on live target, until i finally got a perch on a deal...my first cast ever with it i caught a PB LM that holds up to this day lol"
964499,kickingfrog,2016-03-30 19:44:00,8333,"I should have at least taken a photo of the bigger version.  It was priced very competitively, for musky baits, at $25."
964500,jimmer,2016-03-30 19:53:00,2730,"They look great, that's why I bought one once before. Never bought another after I lost it."
964504,BucktownAngler,2016-03-30 20:12:00,582,are live target any better then the equivalent rapala lure?
964506,manitoubass2,2016-03-30 20:25:00,11391," Other than that, the water I fish, id say no."
964511,kickingfrog,2016-03-30 20:44:00,8333,"Subjective. In a lot of cases, I do think it matters more to the angler than the fish.  Most of my hard bait fishing can be covered by some lure that rapala makes, and for me, that's my starting point, not just from a niche but also from a cost stand point.  Like most of us I've got a lot of lures and when something new comes out I compare it to what I already have (and what is already out there). We've all got our price points. I'll pay a certain amount for certain types of lures, for certain types of fish. Some would think I'm nutts to pay X dollars for Y to catch Z, and others might think I'm nutts not to pay $X for Y to catch Z.  For the most part I've got enough lures to cover the types of fish I fish for and the places I fish them, and the ways I fish them. Mostly I'm replacing lost lures or expanding colours for ""good"" ones. So I don't spend as much per year on lures as I once did.  I do also factor the ""cost per fish"" as well. A hard bait that will last for years is not the same (to me) as a soft plastic that will only last a fish or two.  I see this lure slotting into a spot that I already have a number of lures (big husky jerks and x-raps for pike) so this will compliment that... and it is something I know my brother doesn't have."
964545,hunteronwheels,2016-03-30 23:56:00,112,i have over 20 live targets and i like them and will buy more i only buy them when i can get a sale or a deal for them but your right the price point can be daunting i for the first time have bought a lure retriever and have saved at least a hundred bucks with it
964548,Joeytier,2016-03-31 00:27:00,3990,"Have they improved the durability of their finishes?  I have the smelt jerkbait and caught a few pike on it, really effective jerkbait, but after 2-3 pike the finish was already wrecked."
964550,kickingfrog,2016-03-31 01:19:00,8333,I haven't had any issues with the finish but I fish rapalas more.  Here is a photo of the minnow type hard baits I use for pike:    suspending husky jerk x-rap saltwater x-rap livetarget sucker livetarget herring magnum saltwater rapala j-13 18 rapala minnow  I don't use the last 3 as much as I used to but they were in the pike box.
964555,manitoubass2,2016-03-31 01:39:00,11391,"Get yourself a white xrap.  I thought it be good for bass(mimicking a shiner) and holy crap I dont think one bass has eating it, all pike.  Also the clown colour rapala subwalk. The action drives pike nuts"
964560,kickingfrog,2016-03-31 02:13:00,8333,"Get yourself a white xrap.  I thought it be good for bass(mimicking a shiner) and holy crap I dont think one bass has eating it, all pike.  Also the clown colour rapala subwalk. The action drives pike nuts   You thought those were the only colours I use, or best ones? That's precious."
964561,PUMP KNOWS,2016-03-31 02:16:00,937,Nice sucker and nice line up.  What size is the saltwater x-rap and do you know the weight?  What size X-rap is the one above it?
964562,manitoubass2,2016-03-31 02:23:00,11391,???  Just trying to help out! Obviously a pike angler doesnt have just a few baits.  So. Do you have white xraps?
964604,wormdunker,2016-03-31 12:09:00,1711,"Live Target Smelt, jointed, awesome on Erie walleye!  I initially tried 1 last summer out on an inline planer board.  Lure wasn't in the water 4 minutes - WHAM! Fish on!  After putting 4 nice wallys in the boat I headed directly to Grimsby Tackle, bought 4 more!  Pricey, but worth it."
964606,Dara,2016-03-31 12:11:00,3052,"For goodness sake, its pike fishing...toss out a silver/gold williams wabbler and be done with it."
964608,AKRISONER,2016-03-31 13:08:00,5558,"on the topic of hardbaits....how you fish them and the action is basically all that matters.  You either feel confident with how the bait moves through the water or you dont.  this summer i lost my rapala minnow rap in hot steel and have never been able to find one since...that aside from the zara spook jr was the best hard bait i ever owned.  That thing caught me literally every single species of fish you could imagine! Youd think its like any other rapala out there, but that particular lure dove at a perfect speed, wiggled at such a nice frequency...i could work that bait over anything, and it hammered fish. Ive never found another crankbait that i can fish so well since...ive almost folded and just bought a bunch off of the internet.  As time is moving on, my tackle box is growing, but more with just the same stuff. If you really are getting on the fish with one type of bait, why bother changing? find a few patterns and colours and just work that."
964612,Fish Farmer,2016-03-31 13:39:00,2234,Those live Target are a lot cheaper at the swap meet.
964618,grimsbylander,2016-03-31 13:54:00,3016,"IMO, I look at quality of hardware and durability as top critia for rating baits...hooks, split rings and line eyes. Live Target and Spro use good quality stuff."
964621,Joeytier,2016-03-31 14:17:00,3990,Yep.
