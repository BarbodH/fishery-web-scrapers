964312,anders,2016-03-29 15:13:00,1168,"As the title suggests, im looking for a pink downrigger rod!  I have been looking around and can not find anything.  I know it may be a stretch but im just curious if anyone out there has seen one or would know of where to get one.  Thanks"
964321,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-29 16:06:00,8243,Buy a spray can of paint. Acrylic latex actually and prime it first.
964322,Dara,2016-03-29 16:11:00,3052,"Canadian Tire has other types of pink rods, St Croix has pink rods, Pearl  7' medium fast. Not quite but you should be able to get something."
964332,anders,2016-03-29 17:26:00,1168,"I know I can get rods generally used for other types of fishing.  I know I can spray paint as well but would rather purchase one that is already pink.  My daughter wants her own downrigger road, and we can settle on pink, just no princesses on it."
964334,Dara,2016-03-29 17:50:00,3052,I will keep an eye out at CT in the Sault...not really a thing that is heavily advertised...lots of stuff showing up in Pink lately
964338,Sterling,2016-03-29 18:35:00,477,"If it's that important maybe contact the manufacturers directly?  Afaik ugly stik can do it, they charge $70 plus your man card"
964339,anders,2016-03-29 18:36:00,1168,"lol.....hey if my little girl wants to come fish with me and have her own pink downrigger card, you can consider my man card turned in!!"
964340,Dara,2016-03-29 18:39:00,3052,"lol.....hey if my little girl wants to come fish with me and have her own pink downrigger card, you can consider my man card turned in!!   My Daughter is getting a pink 30-06..no biggy"

964354,dave524,2016-03-29 19:55:00,4508,"According to Lorne Green, some oldtimers will recognize the name, the Fenwick Riggersticks of the 80's and quite well thought of as a downrigger rod were simply Fenwick 9 foot 10 weight fibreglass fly rod blanks built as a downrigger rod. I built lots of them for myself and friends back then. If you could find a 10 weight flyrod blank in pink maybe you could have it built as a riggerstick, just a thought. If you go to mudhole.com you can search for pink blanks but I see nothing that I would recommend as a riggerstick."
964360,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-29 20:22:00,8243,"Bubba Watson hits his driver 400 yards. It is pink too. His ""Man"" card and manhood is firmly intact. I have a few salmon coloured shirts and sweaters, some might say they are pink, so what. Colour has nothing to do with femininity.  I really don't think you are going to find a pink downrigger rod though. I have never seen one after long lining and downrigging for 35 years. Save yourself the headache and gas money and paint one pink."

964366,Gallie,2016-03-29 20:41:00,1215,"A guy on the lou board runs pink rigger rods with his wife on lake o ill see if i can find out what they are, he is in the states though so not sure if available here."
964368,Bill Shearer,2016-03-29 20:41:00,456,"Dave 524 has it nailed! I used 9wt Fenwick 9'ers, and they were very forgiving of inexperienced anglers. The key factors to look for in the blank are slow action, full bend, and inexpensive. No need for quick response that would be nice if using for casting."
964378,bare foot wader,2016-03-29 21:41:00,1354,"tape off any rod you want to use, and it with a couple light coats of pink krylon"
964381,wkrp,2016-03-29 22:02:00,656,I may have one in my closet.

964453,anders,2016-03-30 13:05:00,1168,yea I figured....but hey...always a chance right!
964455,Gallie,2016-03-30 13:22:00,1215,"He uses pink teflon tape on his rigger rods, so theres an idea i guess lol. Good luck"
964460,Gregoire,2016-03-30 13:54:00,1397,"Tackle industries made a pink musky rod for a while. Might be a bit stiff for rigging, but could work. Not sure if they make it anymore."
