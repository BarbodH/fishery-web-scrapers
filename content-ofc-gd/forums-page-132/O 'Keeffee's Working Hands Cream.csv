964941,leaf4,2016-04-02 20:10:00,2466,"Shoulda picked some up a few weeks ago, wearing gloves and sweating in them wreaked havoc on the fingertips and had similar looking cracked skin on the sides of most of my fingers, will have to pick some up!"
964942,Pigeontroller,2016-04-02 20:19:00,2793,Great product.
964945,dave524,2016-04-02 20:32:00,4508,"Looks good . When I worked in waste water treatment in a steel mill I had similar hands, used Bag Balm from TSC and it worked good too. We had what they called a barrier cream at work that you put on before work that helped too."

964977,Whitespinnerbait,2016-04-03 01:04:00,2038, My thumbs got in that condition mainly from washing my hands several times a day with hand soap that contains mineral spirits and pumice.
