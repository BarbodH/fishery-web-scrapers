964264,Tom S,2016-03-29 00:46:00,362,"I've lurked here long enough that I figure I should probably introduce myself.  I live down in Haldimand County. Don't get out fishing nearly enough these days, but having young kids does that to you. Just started to take the oldest out fishing with me in the evenings this past summer - he loves it.  A number of years ago I took up fly fishing - mostly for bass and panfish. Although my catch percentage is worse than when I'm spin fishing I still love it. Especially using older click-pawl reels and fiberglass rods. Just plain fun. I've rebuilt one fiberglass rod and am currently finishing up a second one.  Enough yakking, here's some pictures of what I enjoy.   Clouser Deep Minnows - for the Smallies   Rebuilding an old Herter's rod   Matched up with a JW Young Pridex   Good match for these guys   Current Project   The other hobby  Hopefully I can find a way to contribute here, maybe meet some new people.

964440,Tom S,2016-03-30 11:43:00,362,"I disagree. You fell through the ice, got out and landed a fish.  Bacon is amazing, but not chris brock caliber IMO That's signature material.  I'm going to counter with a triple bacon threat, but I'm not sure it's enough to out do a dunking. The greatest danger I was in was from grease stains....  "
