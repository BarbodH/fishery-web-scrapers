901811,Joeytier,2015-03-05 23:16:00,3990,"I've been lucky enough to get out fishing quite a bit these past few weeks, so I decided I'd snap some pics for once today since it was reasonably warm today.  Working shift work = lots of weekdays off = lots of solo fishing.  So I loaded up the safari and headed to my favorite local lake trout lake.  The zone 11 lake trout hard water season is only a month long so I try to maximize my time targeting these beautiful northern lake trout while I can.    This lake is known for numbers, not size.  I typically won't see many trout over 17"" here, so I was happy to see this beauty come out of the hole...    Plastered right to the bottom in 80 fow (right where they usually are), I get another good strike that is obviously another larger than average fish...    Fished a little more, then packed up and took the scenic ride home and bounced between a few lakes on the bush trails and eventually back to the truck.     And the ultimate winter prize... "
901815,chris.brock,2015-03-05 23:28:00,4053,Nice outing!  Looks like those lakers are more into eating insects rather than fish. I bet they taste a lot better than usual greasers.
901821,Joeytier,2015-03-05 23:46:00,3990," But one of the fish from today had a few pebbles in its stomach, which explains their bottom orientation."
901826,spincast,2015-03-06 00:05:00,3279,sweeet Huge tail on that first one! Hey Chad - where were ya man? Look at them lakers?
901852,Acountdeleted,2015-03-06 02:14:00,2562,Those are some sweet sweet lakers. Those fillets are making my hungry.
901853,limeyangler,2015-03-06 02:17:00,5204,"Nice red meat on those lakers JT, looked like a bright , cold day!"
901855,grizzlybri,2015-03-06 02:18:00,565,Those are some sweet sweet lakers. Those fillets are making my hungry.  Well hopefully we'll get some nice meals on sunday
901859,Joeytier,2015-03-06 02:30:00,3990,"Still feeling like February here, but that big angry ball is starting to throw out some heat during the afternoon at least!"
901896,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-06 07:25:00,8243,"Wonderful outing JoeyT. How do you do up the Lakers.  There are a rare find here, too shallow of a lake (Erie) I believe. It's been 30 years since I put one in the boat at Lynn Lake Man."
901911,Rod Caster,2015-03-06 12:17:00,5784,Nice bottom dwellers!  Rick: I was up north for work...ugh... But Joey said he'd give me his next 12 lakers  Rainbows Sunday Bud!
901912,solopaddler,2015-03-06 12:35:00,8605,Very nice!
901921,AKRISONER,2015-03-06 14:19:00,5558,"Get the grill absolutely smoking hot, clean the grates up good. slather on a mixture of Honey, sesame oil, lime juice and sriracha.  Throw the fish directly on the grill skin down for 4-5 minutes....take off and eat the best damn trout youve ever tasted"
901951,4x4bassin,2015-03-06 16:27:00,1025,"Nice JT , love the laker outings !!!"
901969,NAW,2015-03-06 17:10:00,4022,Nice!!
