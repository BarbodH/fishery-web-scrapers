901919,AKRISONER,2015-03-06 14:04:00,5558,id submit this for a world record lol Biggest bird caught through ice.
901924,grimsbylander,2015-03-06 14:25:00,3016,"The full run toward the open water had me as surprised as the bird. I, like the bird, am an ice chicken."
901939,jimmer,2015-03-06 15:18:00,2730,That was awesome!
901940,Joey,2015-03-06 15:37:00,9122,"Wow, that was cool, glad the bird was ok and did not swallow the hook"
901949,4x4bassin,2015-03-06 16:26:00,1025,Birds lucky day !
901968,NAW,2015-03-06 17:08:00,4022,Crazy guys fishing that close to open water on a river. IMO.  Very cool video though!
902084,wormdunker,2015-03-07 08:20:00,1711,Holy quackers - that was cool!
902093,woodenboater,2015-03-07 13:05:00,2277,"yup, too close to the open lead for my taste, current or not current."
902137,Algoma Guy,2015-03-07 18:48:00,19,Why did that seem set up to me? Cool vid though!
902239,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-08 08:36:00,8243,"I'm with Algoma Guy here. Do they run to the hole with camera filming every time they get a hit? If they did it on purpose they should have the same thing done to them, if not, well I don't know what to say I have never heard of a bird ever pulled up a hole. And am glad no animals were harmed. As far as too close to the hole, I got blasted for saying the same thing earlier in this ice season when I said the guy was nuts for doing so."
902675,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-10 14:11:00,937,"I'm not a fan of these winter birds.  They chase my lures when I'm casting in the winter.  I had one pick up my bait on the bottom and bring it up to the surface, I was lucky it didn't get hooked."
