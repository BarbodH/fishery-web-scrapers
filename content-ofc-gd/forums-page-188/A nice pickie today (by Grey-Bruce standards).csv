902194,fishnguy,2015-03-08 01:44:00,96,"Took my little guy out fishing today with the Father in Law to a small lake not too far from Owen Sound.  Got a bunch of dinky perch then one nice surprise wally right before we left.  Knew there were walleye in the lake, but heard they were all pretty stunted.  At +3lbs, it's a good fish by Grey/Bruce standards.  We released it to get bigger.  http://s7.postimg.org/ya8jbfarv/photo_3.jpg  http://s21.postimg.org/f0o0thv3b/photo_2_1.jpg  http://s3.postimg.org/rxpyof3ib/photo_1.jpg"

902202,Rod Caster,2015-03-08 03:03:00,5784,By my standards that's a nice walleye!
902223,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-08 05:17:00,8243,"What Rod Caster said X 2. A beauty, thanks for the release, it must have been tough to let her go."
902250,NAW,2015-03-08 12:30:00,4022,"For sure that's a great fish for the area!!  I usually make it up that way once a winter, and always land a few pics, but never anything that fat!"

902390,Joeytier,2015-03-08 23:27:00,3990,That's a great walleye by anyone's standards.  Looks like a fun day
902443,northernpike56,2015-03-09 05:30:00,717,"Beauty walleye for any body of water, that thing has some serious size to it! I'm going to take a fairly educated guess at where you were fishing, and for the record, I think I have caught 1 largemouth and a handful of perch and sunfish out of that lake LOL"
