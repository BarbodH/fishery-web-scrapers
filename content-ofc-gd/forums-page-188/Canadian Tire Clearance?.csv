I know there reg price may be a lil higher but at half off some things are worth grabbing. Best part is i use my Canadian tire money to pay for it all, if only my wife hadn't bought that vacuum cleaner with it i coulda grabbed more fishing swag.  The Bins   A few odds and ends I grabbed "

901716,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-05 13:57:00,8243,"Are the pics of the clearance bin or your shopping cart? I actually was in CTC Dunnville yesterday and they were stocking the peg boards with hardware and dozens of reels for the locked showcases. I thought I was going to have a panic attack seeing all the goodies. I had to call my sponsor for SIDNA, Stuff I Don't need Anonymous.  It has been such a long winter of looking out the patio door every morning hoping the ice went out on the lake that I was actually drooling over push button Zebcos. It's that bad.  PS, Erie still has ice on it as far as the eye can see this AM. We will need a fiery meteorite to crash in it in order to have open water by spring. Some say "" Man you are so lucky to have a lake view"" Try looking at ice all day when it should be open water, torture, sheer torture."
