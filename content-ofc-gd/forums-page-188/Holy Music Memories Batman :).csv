902195,lookinforwalleye,2015-03-08 01:52:00,4399,I do fellow hippy.
902196,Joey,2015-03-08 02:02:00,9122,"I do fellow hippy.   Lol, yup, I also noticed on the right side of Youtube, songs that go along with this, one is ""a whiter shade of pale"""
902204,HTHM,2015-03-08 03:10:00,4082,"I'm listening to the YES discography right now, next on the usb is Procol Harum..."
902218,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-08 04:39:00,8243,Oh the memories. Flying down the QEW to Sherkston Beach with the top down on the TR6 with the Muntz Quadrophnic 100 watt per channel 8 track cranked as my curly flowing locks blew in the wind a foot behind. Not too many drum solos and yodelling in songs these days. Pass me the peach schnapps you Hippy freak.
902228,bigugli,2015-03-08 05:59:00,6138,Still listen to it all the time.  Did you ever notice how van Leer and Ackerman were kinda spoofed in the Muppets house band. Other member spoofs were Mary Travers and Billy Preston as Dr Tooth
902232,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-08 06:23:00,8243,"What genre did the Muppets put out, Punk, never did like Punk. I have a pic of my wife with purple hair and a diaper pin in her cheek. Don't know the Muppets Bruce. Only kidding, no kids so never watched the Muppets.  I see we lost Billy Preston recently. Loved learning the walking on the Sun dance. Did you guys do that dance? Lennon referred to him as the 5th Beatle more than once."
902242,Roy,2015-03-08 09:53:00,13728,"   Did you guys do that dance?   and quit calling us ""guys""."
902274,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-08 14:46:00,8243,"Haaaa, touche. But I know how old you all are if you are listening Rock and Roll as old as Moses, maybe not, Rock and Roll never dies. All the nieces and nephews want to know what I'm doing with all my albums when I kick the bucket."
902300,grizzlybri,2015-03-08 16:55:00,565," and quit calling us ""guys"".  I see this strikes another thread ( http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=78017)    Watched the remake of Robocop today this song was on it and I have not heard this for over at least 30 years (   showing my age, I know).   Anyone remember it????????   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGaVUApDVuY  Nope, but mind you it was 11 years before I came kicking and screaming into this world"
902476,pics,2015-03-09 14:19:00,1268,I actually enjoyed the remake and the soundtrack as well... plus it was interesting to pick out parts of Hamilton that were in the movie..
902547,T-Bone,2015-03-09 20:05:00,160,"Remember it? I have it on my iPod. It comes up randomly every 4-6 months or so...and I crank it...  That goes WAAAAY back...almost 40 years now, I'd bet...."
902549,Acountdeleted,2015-03-09 20:07:00,2562,Great song. I just had no idea what the name of it was. I just knew it as 'the song with yodelling in it'
902554,Mike Pike,2015-03-09 20:15:00,1332,"As much as I LOVED that tune in the days of my youth, I would NEVER play that for my daughter and tell her; 'Yup, that's when music was good.""  LOLThanks for the memories, Joey."
902593,bigugli,2015-03-09 22:15:00,6138,"  van Leer on keyboard, vocals, flute and whistling. There was a lot of ""experimental"" music in the late 60's and early 70's where folk music and classical were blended with rock and pop. There definitely was ""no same old, same old"" then"
902594,bigugli,2015-03-09 22:17:00,6138,"  Could be worse. I had to explain what a ""pet shop boy"" was.  And the answer is anything but family rated."
902599,Shloim,2015-03-09 22:55:00,515,"So since we've well established ourselves as a bunch of old folks or hippies if you please? , who is going to see The Grateful Dead in Chicago this summer? My wife and I have tickets for all 3 nights and managed to get ourselves seats on a plane that was fully chartered by Toronto dead heads... Some friends are friends with a pilot at Porter, therefore the hook up. Then to top it off about 75 of us are staying in the same hotel. Oh, it will be messy...Nobody else going ?"
902601,Joeytier,2015-03-09 23:02:00,3990,"Hocus Pocus...still a hit to this day.  Never was a big fan of Focus.  Saw some classic Uriah Heep and Jethro Tull in the similar videos though, that's the truly timeless stuff!"
902605,bigugli,2015-03-09 23:18:00,6138,"  Add to that some Edgar Winter, Iron Butterfly, Deep Purple and Vanilla Fudge"
902618,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-10 00:23:00,8243,"I had to Google ""Pet Shop Boys"" ouch. Better call P3TA."
