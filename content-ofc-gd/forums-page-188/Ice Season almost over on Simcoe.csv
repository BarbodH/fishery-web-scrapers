902166,Terry,2015-03-07 22:25:00,14456,yup lots of ice  
902168,LostAnotherOne,2015-03-07 22:51:00,956,Thanks guys.  I still have time to catch a new species (whitefish).
902498,Basschaser77,2015-03-09 16:20:00,32,OMG! A little girl just out fished me for lakers and whities this season!  Anyways good for her. It was a nice catch.
902515,Acountdeleted,2015-03-09 17:39:00,2562,Anyone more in the know then myself want to let me know when the ice is getting 'iffy'? I'd love one more shot at whitefish but don't want to take my life into my own hands.  Oops. Only 6 more days to target whitefish on Simcoe. I'd better get my butt in gear.
902582,icefisherman,2015-03-09 21:32:00,952,"Season is closing this weekend. So go get them. As far as ice....plenty of it everywhere...should last easily until season end. Maybe the shoreline could get slushy...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
