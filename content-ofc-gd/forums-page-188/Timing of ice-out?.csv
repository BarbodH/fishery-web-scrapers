902095,Mister G,2015-03-07 14:45:00,1429," I remember that spring. My daughter was born on the 19th and I was driving to the hospital in shorts with the windows down. It was almost 30 degrees the whole week. I remember that week also.....that was back in the good old days of global warming. Now we have ""The Ice Age""...LOL"
902096,Mister G,2015-03-07 14:49:00,1429,Timing of Ice Out will be very difficult this year because I don't think Mother Nature is done making ice this year.
901814,captpierre,2015-03-05 23:26:00,2521,So with another cold night tonight  gonna be a while before soft water. Can't remember when the Kawarthas thawed last spring. This year?
901820,buckhorn250,2015-03-05 23:40:00,85,Upper Buckhorn was at least 2 to 3 weeks late last year. Most years the majority of ice is out during March break with the exception of the smaller bays...last year wasn't out until end of March. I suspect this year will be as late. No soft water until early April...then the flooding starts.
901832,kickingfrog,2015-03-06 00:30:00,8333,One week of wet weather and the whole thing goes. Barrie area had good cold winter with minimal melts but we also didn't get the usual snowfall either.  In other words: Too many factors to say with much confidence at this point.
901833,Joeytier,2015-03-06 00:42:00,3990,"Trailered my boat to a local splake lake May 1st last year and I should have brought the sled, shorelines had barely opened up.  Sureeee hope we don't have another one of those."
901834,crappieperchhunter,2015-03-06 00:49:00,2582,I was on Cooch on 24 inches of ice April 9th last year. The shoreline was getting bad so I never went out again after that...still my latest ice fishing  date. I really think this year will be in the same ball park.  I actually hope it is. I had a real good spring last year shore fishing for crappies and gills. And one spot I got crappies from shore until June. Haven't ever came close to that before.
901860,Acountdeleted,2015-03-06 02:41:00,2562,Ha. It's so strange how a few KM can change an area. I feel like it was around April 9th when I took a girl aoftwater fishing at the Narrows in Orillia.
901862,grizzlybri,2015-03-06 02:50:00,565,"""warmer"" weather is coming next week so Environment Canada claims,  I'm hoping so because I have had enough of this winter."
901864,206,2015-03-06 03:03:00,563,"pics on my phone of first trip in my boat was May 6 2014, for crappie. I have some from march 23rd 2012 and april 28th 2013 just for an idea"
901884,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-06 04:23:00,10439,Ice goes out on my lake in mid June!!! Then she freezes up in mid to late October.
901895,Freshtrax,2015-03-06 07:14:00,2215,Plus double digits after next weekend should help.    I'm done with this winter.   Bring on soft water.
901950,Beans,2015-03-06 16:27:00,3339,"According to my ""Ice Out"" pictures folder for Pigeon Lake north shore:  2005 19 April  2006 13 April  2007 18 April  2008 20 April  2010 02 April  2012 21 March  2013 21 April  2014 sometime after 21 April (5 days ?)(scrapped old truck...no ride to lake)  As the ice was late coming this past winter I'm guessing it wasn't as thick as last year so I'll hazard a guess at 15 Apr 2015 providing we get some decent warm weather..."
901955,4x4bassin,2015-03-06 16:35:00,1025,"Was just talking to a couple of my ""weather buddies"" and there telling me that it is going to get colder/cooler again next week after a couple days of warmer weather . As well as being cooler then normal for the rest of the month into April . Lots of ice to melt so by this info. I would be saying it will be just like last year or maybe even a bit later for open water !"
901957,BillM,2015-03-06 16:41:00,17367,Southern shore of Lake O is calling my name.
901960,kickingfrog,2015-03-06 16:50:00,8333,"According to my ""Ice Out"" pictures folder for Pigeon Lake north shore:   2012 21 March    I remember that spring. My daughter was born on the 19th and I was driving to the hospital in shorts with the windows down. It was almost 30 degrees the whole week."
901991,BowSlayer101,2015-03-06 18:56:00,296,"April 28th was my last ice day last year, wouldn't mind a thaw but also def. wouldn't mind it being the same as last year, bring on the last ice northern whities!"
901998,AKRISONER,2015-03-06 19:25:00,5558,"I was out fishing April 5th on Georgian Bay last year. and it was below 0 all day. Pointe Au baril usually breaks up really quick too because of the current and constantly changing water levels.  Its gonna be a while lol. Cant lie though, im a little excited to dig out tinner and begin my casting platform conversion and mount my new trolling motor.   Bill, lake O looks pretty open from my office might be a bit ""hard"" to launch"
902001,Canuck2fan,2015-03-06 19:53:00,1444,"I like everyone's optimism that will be an ice out.... LOL  Last year where and what we fish for from shore, was completely ruined by the late ice and the fact that the lakes never warmed up."
902005,SirCranksalot,2015-03-06 20:01:00,3291,"We should get some sort of pool/bet going here. For Simcoe maybe??,"
902031,spincast,2015-03-06 22:31:00,3279,Southern shore of Lake O is calling my name. Yes indeed!!. Queenston should be open with next weeks weather - if you don't mind pinball alley around the chunks on the way to the bar. Fingers crossed for Jordan or  PD to open up soon!
902032,misfish,2015-03-06 22:36:00,29133,Yes indeed!!. Queenston should be open with next weeks weather - if you don't mind pinball alley around the chunks on the way to the bar. Fingers crossed for Jordan or  PD to open up soon!   I see a road trip in my future.
902036,spincast,2015-03-06 22:55:00,3279,"  I see a road trip in my future. You betcha bud - My turn for host waters  - got a seat with your name on it , as you don't mind the cold weather, it may be up front on the other side of the stand up if that's ok?"
902037,misfish,2015-03-06 22:58:00,29133,"You betcha bud - My turn for host waters  - got a seat with your name on it , as you don't mind the cold weather, it may be up front on the other side of the stand up if that's ok? Can I jig? Not the dance type BTW, Then again,it does keep me warm when Im jumping around.."
902058,BillM,2015-03-07 01:27:00,17367,Yes indeed!!. Queenston should be open with next weeks weather - if you don't mind pinball alley around the chunks on the way to the bar. Fingers crossed for Jordan or  PD to open up soon!  Great minds think alike
902072,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-07 04:03:00,10439,"Seeing how most of our ice roads still have 40,000-65,000kg load limits, I think it will be a while yet.  Fer you Mericans that's 88,000-141,000lbs."
