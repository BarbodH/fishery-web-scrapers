901488,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-04 06:47:00,8243,"Last fall I installed a new combo transducer on the transom of my StarCraft Superfisherman 190. There is a 5 foot rooster tail it is throwing up. No big deal until I mounted my kicker, now that rooster tail is hitting the kicker and throwing the water onto the casting platform and into the battery box. Found an inch of water in there. That's not good. Should I lower it or raise it. I mounted it exactly in the same spot as the old Garmin transducer, used the old holes as reference. What do you all think? I say lower it a 1/4 inch, a pal says raise it. It shows the exact depth  my second and third sonars show. Not a big job, but I want to adjust it once.  Thanks Johnny D"
901502,BillM,2015-03-04 12:52:00,17367,Sounds like it's mounted a bit too deep on the transom.
901523,irishfield,2015-03-04 15:01:00,26272,Or it's shooting water thru the gap between bracket and puck. Mine did that on a smaller scale and nothing a good blob of black RTV couldn't fix. Hasn't let go in 8 seasons now and I can still click it up and down a notch or two to switch from running at speed and tracking canon balls.
901529,mr blizzard,2015-03-04 15:35:00,1589,"Old Ironmaker I have the same problem, adjusted it three times and is still doing the same thing , looking forward to the suggestions"
901536,Cosmos,2015-03-04 16:00:00,588,I had same issue with mine Humminbird until I find a small rubber plug to put between mount and transducer. I did help a lot. You can google Humminbird rubber plug to see how it looks.
901577,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-04 19:35:00,8243,"It is a Hummingbird. I never thought it might be shooting water up through the gap. It will be a while before it sees water. Unless everything melts in a few days and I will be able to float it off the trailer in the driveway!  Irish, what is black RTV?"
901607,musky666,2015-03-04 21:22:00,126,"I have also seen pics where folks have affixed a piece of rubber, like a flap, over top of the transducer to stop the rooster tail..."
901614,davey buoy,2015-03-04 22:18:00,5505,"My spray is about 3' high but shoots out the back with no issues.Marks at all speeds.I see no need for me to adjust it ,but yours certainly is not spraying the same.Mine is a humminbird as well.Sounds like it may have to come up a tad?."
901675,irishfield,2015-03-05 02:08:00,26272,Silicon Sealant OI... Black matches the transducer.
901689,porkpie,2015-03-05 04:06:00,2521,"Good idea,  the rooster tail from my DI transducer was pissing me off last year!  Never would've thought of it being the gap."
901703,DanD,2015-03-05 12:18:00,2223,Silicon Sealant OI... Black matches the transducer.   This silicone sticks like baby crap to a blanket.  Dan.
901708,Fish Farmer,2015-03-05 12:55:00,2234,"I had the same problem John, I call Humminbird and they sent me the rubber plug. The plug was still a little lose so I use a little Silicone sealer to seal and tighten it up. Problem solved. Were you been bud, you've been quiet."
901710,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-05 13:13:00,8243,"Thanks all, consensus is I need to plug the gap. I will call Hummingbird. Quiet? That's a first Dave, Ticha would say differently. Actually have been working on a pals big 30 footer in his nice warm shop and watching the ice on the lake."
901745,manjo39,2015-03-05 16:25:00,354,"Wow, thanks guys!  I have this exact problem and was going to look into it in the spring.  I just contacted Humminbird and they're sending me the plug!  Thanks for posting!"
901972,Mister G,2015-03-06 17:24:00,1429,Sometimes just tilting the transducer a click forward or two will also solve your problem. Forward means the beam will be shooting forward towards the bow of the boat. This is also a good tip if you are losing bottom reading during high speeds. Don't understand WHY these sonar companies don't give out these tips for self installation.
902047,Fishwilly,2015-03-07 00:23:00,206,I know exactly what it is. The water shoots up like a fountain. Had the same issue and Humminbird admitted its a design flaw. They have remedied the situation with a rubber piece that fills that gap. Just call them up (1-800-633-1468) and mention the problem. They sent me one free of charge.  Cheers
