Looking for somewhere where they can play, fish (I have a boat) and overall just have a great time.  I am currently booked at Golden Beach Resort on Rice Lake, but have read some reviews that are making me nervous about going there.  I live in Brampton...anything within a few hours is fine.  Thanks in advance!!"

902098,Mister G,2015-03-07 14:58:00,1429,"I haven't been to a campground that wasn't family friendly.........actually would like to find one that's not kid friendly/allowed.....hate the little buggers....they are always running around, screaming, climbing, yelling, running up and down the dock and climbing into my boat. Why can't the parents keep restrains on these little monsters............why can't they just sit down and relax with a beer like the rest of us....  I got to go..........my son is taking me out for breakfast."

902118,huzzsaba,2015-03-07 16:18:00,884,"Ontario Provincial Parks are the best!  The best of them for kids and highly recommended is  Pinery Provincial Park near Grand Bend which is less than 2.5 hours from your place.  It has one of the best beaches, great sites, fishing in the ausable channel and you can take your boat out on to lake Huron.  at the Ausable channel, you can rent kayas, canoes and paddle boats.  The campground has a great park store.  Other Parks I have gone to and are great parks that have fishing close by and I'm sure a boat launch:  Point Farms Provincial Park ( 2.5 hours) This is one of my favorite parks.  Good for 2 night stay. Awenda Provincial Park (1.5 hours) Nice Park with awesome sites and lots of activities. Rondeau Provincial Park 3.5 hours) Lot of activities but not so private sites. Sandbanks Provincial Park (3 hours)  Whichever park you choose, check the reviews on tripadvisor.com and you can get a better idea on the campsites from this campsitepictures.com.  If you need help choosing a park or want specifics on some good sites, you can send me a pm.    "
