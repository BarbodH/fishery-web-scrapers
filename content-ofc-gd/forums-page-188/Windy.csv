And then the wind picks up,  could have tried to sit in a hut at the end of a runway with a 747 doing a full wind up.  It actually lifted the hut to one side when I stood up. Brian, the Buddy Heater plate works like a charm,  reheated my Bacon McGriddle and hash brown in no time.   Thanks again."

Yup windy,but it held with no prob. Love the straps compared to the rope the eskimo comes with. Taking down was a breeze LOL  One stink,n hit for Lillys and I effort. WOW The grill is sweet. Lilly had a hot dog for breakfast.   Thats what she wanted.LOL  Looking forward to some walk out after work this week. Temps are going to be perfect."

Oh ya, still better than looking out of windows all day on the weekend.  Tried out my new in line reel, works well.  Unfortunately fish bit on the other rod so I'll have to try again."
