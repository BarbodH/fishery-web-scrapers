901756,bigugli,2015-03-05 17:16:00,6138,"  A few places also saw the introduction of largemouth. When I used to stay with my uncle, we'd catch loads of bass to bring home for supper.  If we were asked about our luck, I was to tell the folks we were catching trout ""cause no self-respecting bluenoser fishes for them garbage fish""."
901784,Garfisher,2015-03-05 20:36:00,229,"Haha I do enjoy bass more than trout I must admit, and some of the lakes out there are just full of bass around a foot long.  They're also introduced in Ontario, they were originally restricted to the Mississippi drainage and nearby waters. As were largemouth, if I recall correctly. They are native to the Great Lakes, the St.Lawrence, and the Ottawa (plus tributaries) as well, however they're widely introduced elsewhere in the province  . For instance there's bass in Algonquin Park in the north end, which are native, but the bass in the 60 corridor are all introduced populations. There are even lakes in the northwest corner of the park that are natural rock bass/brook trout lakes."
901822,Steve,2015-03-05 23:48:00,2075,"I shared this before but thought I would share again. I have sm bass nest under my dock every year  I love that video.  It shows exactly what ""some"" (and I mean only some) bass anglers want to be able to fish for them during the spawn.  THAT IS WHY!  (skill? who needs it, lol)"
902130,Dave Bailey,2015-03-07 17:51:00,1641,"Really? It was indeed changed last year(and it made no sense to me)  Ill have to back this up but thats great news for me!!! Wonder why it would have changed for one year?  Don't know who told you there was a season last year, but find them and give them a smack. I just found the 2014 regulations in the back of my car, and FMZ 5 says bass were open all year. There were limits, under a sport license you could only take 4, conservation license 2, and they had to be less than 35cm, and from January 1 to June 30. At all other times they appear to be unregulated."
902136,manitoubass2,2015-03-07 18:30:00,11391,My gawd i had the book.  Not sure where i got that from???
901018,manitoubass2,2015-03-02 17:43:00,11391,"Oh yeah its awesome to watch!  They strike almost anything. Ive even seen them leave a bed and take a run at my dogs 20 ft away.  Its been a few years though because the water has been high and dirty.  But when its crystal clear id oftwn take a cup of tea down from the house at 6 am and watch for an hour or so.  And yes, they attack fast!!!  Turn on a dime them fish. 0 to 100 in a blink of an eye"
901021,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-02 17:46:00,937,I noticed I spent a lot of money on bass tackle when I only fish for them for 2 months.
901022,Dave Bailey,2015-03-02 18:03:00,1641,"Not sure of the other zones? Im in zone 5 and it changed last year. Bass is no longer year round season  I've got the 2015 regs in my hand, and for FMZ 5 it says open all year."
901023,manitoubass2,2015-03-02 18:08:00,11391,"Replied with a novel, lol"

901046,bigugli,2015-03-02 19:48:00,6138,March through to May I spend a lot of time chasing panfish. May I have cats carp pike and walleye to focus on. Bass opener these days is more of a non event. Far too many down here chase then before opener with all sort of lame excuses.
901048,dave524,2015-03-02 19:54:00,4508,"If you want bass fishing you might want to take a trip north, Zones 1 to 9, and much of 10, are year-round seasons. I believe New York has a early spring season, lots of big smallies 6+ pounds in the Niagara and Eastern lake Erie."
901062,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-02 21:31:00,8243,"Indeed both species of Bass show on page 23 of the 2015 regs opened all year. Slot size is any fish under 35cm or under 13.8"".  Bass is catch and release only in NY until sometime in June when there are catch limits. Since I fish for Bass on a bi annual trip there I should know all the regs. exactly shouldn't I?"
901063,Spiel,2015-03-02 21:37:00,9065,"Over grown Sunfish, highly prolific and quite tasty if you can get 'em parasite free."
901065,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-02 21:42:00,8243,"New York State regulations for Bass are from Dec. 1st to the 3rd Saturday in June as catch and release only and only artificial lures.  Open season 3rd Saturday in June until November 30th. Can not keep any fish under 12""."
901072,porkpie,2015-03-02 22:00:00,2521,"Indeed, smallies are tasty creatures!!  I will often bonk a couple of 2lbers for dinner!"
901135,Sinker,2015-03-03 04:42:00,8692,"I kinda have a milk run of species. First ice eyes, then perch, then trout/whities, last ice perch, then ice out perch, then crappies until walleye opens (maybe ice out trout too), by then walleye is in full swing until late june, get a couple musky trips in, great lakes trolling, more early fall musky, then its hunting, hunting, hunting until ice up. Never enough time.  S."
901138,Moosebunk,2015-03-03 04:50:00,3970,Once bass season opens.... you could do yourself a favor and just keep fishing all the other better species still out there and available to catch. lol.  Messing around.  Spring is such a killer season for all sorts of species.
901441,adam lancia,2015-03-04 02:58:00,234,"Wow guys, that's a ton of options! Thanks! I'm going to have to see when I have a few breaks in my schedule and put aside a day or 5 to go fishing :-D"
901709,Garfisher,2015-03-05 12:58:00,229,Smallies are introduced out there and do a great job of out-competing the beloved brook trout to the point they become rare/non-existant in a waterbody.    My brother in law from Mt. Uniak N.S. calls bass garbage fish. ??????
901713,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-05 13:50:00,8243,"Another discussion where one fish is more valuable than another? I hear they are selling bumper stickers "" Kill A Musky Save a Walleye"""
901715,Mister G,2015-03-05 13:57:00,1429,"Another discussion where one fish is more valuable than another? I hear they are selling bumper stickers "" Kill A Musky Save a Walleye"" Now that's just STUPID.............I am NOT a musky guy and would never just kill any fish because I don't like the species. However, I am not going to give a fellow angler grief if he decides to keep a legal musky to eat or mount. There are two sides to every coin."
901717,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-05 14:09:00,8243,"Relax G, it was a tongue in cheek statement based on the outrage resulting from a recent incident on the Detroit River."

901739,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-05 15:56:00,8243,"Naw, but I don't go for that stuff, Walleye and Smallies for me, it could have worked out, too bad."
901748,Mister G,2015-03-05 16:45:00,1429,"Do you have a friend.............................we could have a three way..........bass, walleye and musky....LOL"
900751,adam lancia,2015-03-01 14:33:00,234,"So I primarily fish for bass but since the season opens relatively late, what do you other bass fishermen fish for before that? This is my first season waiting for fishing season to open in Ontario (I used to just fish once we went up to the cottage which wasn't until June anyways...). I was living in Halifax the past two years so there was a lot of trout to be fished, is that the case here? I'm going to be fishing from the banks primarily. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!"
900752,Woodsman,2015-03-01 14:53:00,1286,"Lots of other species to fish for here in Ontario. Many of the river mouths that run into the Great Lakes have runs of trout. Walleye, perch, pike, carp, crappie just to name a few species can also be caught from shore."
900757,BillM,2015-03-01 15:20:00,17367,"Pike, walleye, crappie, whatever."
900759,manjo39,2015-03-01 15:33:00,354,"Right now, ice fishing for Perch, Pike, Lake Trout and Whitefish.  When the ice breaks, Steelhead, Crappie, Walleye, Musky ... then Bass. For Steelhead there is a lot of pressure here in Southern Ontario, so it may be crowded for you compared to Halifax."
900762,dave524,2015-03-01 16:32:00,4508,Being the last to open I always found bass opener to be kinda anticlimactic.
900763,Steve,2015-03-01 16:37:00,2075,"i fish a lot of bass.....but in comparison to the rest, its actually not a lot at all.  in march, from shore, park your butt on the shorelines of niagara river or pt dalhousie.  enjoy strong fighting trout.  that'll last through april.  once pike and walleye open in May, hit the harbour mouths of lake ontario....  finally, once june comes, you can play with your preferred green or brown backs.  but nothing worse than calling yourself a ""bass only"" fisherman.  Your limiting 12 months of fishing down to 4 (or less)."
900771,manitoubass2,2015-03-01 17:20:00,11391,"I consider myself a bass angler but in all honesty I spend more time chasing other fish.  Especially now that the zone 5 regs changed last year. Bass here used to be open all year(which was awesome)  Now its walleye/pike/crappie/lake trout and whities through the ice, which is a blast.  Eager for spring to come though for big walleye and big ice out pike!  I shorefish alot too but i dont know that area at all.  Pike can be a ton of fun from shore!!!!"
900791,lunkerbasshunter,2015-03-01 19:02:00,2585,get some light gear and panfish until may opener for walleye and pike.  Then while walleye fishing pay attn for good bass water on the lakes your on for opening weekend for bass.
900834,porkpie,2015-03-01 23:50:00,2521,"Get yourself a ten foot steelhead rod, and a decent reel, some floats of different sizes.  Add some small splitshot and hooks, some micro tube jigs, twister tails and some small marabou jigs.  A small bag to carry it all in, and I can guarantee you will never be bored.  From first melt steelhead in the open all year sections to spring panfish, then your summer bass fishing and that long rod makes a great carp tool when the bass aren't co-operating.  If your stuck on shore, you will never be bored."
900859,grizzlybri,2015-03-02 01:23:00,565,"I'm gunning for everything thing this year, but last year i had a blast with the channel catfish, pike and walleye. However it seemed like catfish in general were my specialty last year"
900888,Gallie,2015-03-02 02:49:00,1215,I cant believe nobody mentioned carp or suckers. You wanna feel the sheer power of a monster fish from shore on a budget carp is the way to go. You can catch them in a lot of places with corn or worms.
900912,mike rousseau,2015-03-02 05:59:00,4661,"I don't know about staying on a ""budget""  Other then not needing a boat carp fishing can be very expensive if you get into the euro style...  I carry around $1200 in gear when carp fishing... That's just gear for me... And my stuff is mostly low end carp gear...  Yes you can get some on a hook and worm with an ugly stick... But euro carping is the cats meow"
900941,Mister G,2015-03-02 12:57:00,1429,"WOW Mike, $1200 on a fish you can't eat without throwing up is way more then I would of thought."
900953,Acountdeleted,2015-03-02 13:42:00,2562,"Spring crappie is fun. Same with pike. They are pretty easy to catch too. If all else fails, go to perch fest in Orillia. More then enough jumbos for everyone with a hook and a worm."
900955,Gallie,2015-03-02 13:52:00,1215,"Yes i understand you can spend thousands on carp gear but you dont have to in order to have a good time. I have recently dumped some money into carp gear but my 2 biggest have still come on spinning equiptment, 1 on worm 1 on corn."
900973,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-02 15:50:00,8243,It's Perch on Erie after ice out until the beginning of July. Channel Cats from ice out until water temps hit around 50. Then Pike in upstate NY in May for 3 days. Then Walleye in the Grand River until the 3rd Saturday in June when it's Bass time. Then chase the Walleye as they migrate east to west on Erie. A few Rainbows thrown in as a bonus. Fall we head to 30 to 50 feet of water and try and coax a big Mama Smallmouth to bite. It's quite common to hit the 7 pound mark and may be lucky enough to get beyond 8lbs.  My brother in law from Mt. Uniak N.S. calls bass garbage fish. ??????
900977,mike rousseau,2015-03-02 15:55:00,4661,"That's right...  Like anything it's as expensive as you want it to be   My buddy's gear he brings has to be over $5,000... Minimum  Or you can go with a can of corn and sit on a rock... Whatever suits you...  My gear allows me to do more and fish better... Without getting into the high end euro gear... So it was worth the inicial cost for me..."
900978,manitoubass2,2015-03-02 15:55:00,11391,"Maybe because not many people eat them?  Ive had to keep a few over the years and did not enjoy them at all. Shallow cold water fish.  Maybe a deep bass would taste better???  Weird because for their diet consisting so much of crawfish(up here) you would think the meat would be awesome. Instead its like the meat is half spoiled, spongy.  Sure love catching them though!"
900987,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-02 16:33:00,8243,"Eat a Bass!!! Blasphemy I say, blasphemy. I might eat one if it is obviously going to die, I'd most likely give it away.. Otherwise it would be like eating the family pet Rabbit. I have said here before that we can sit on the deck and watch the Bass spawn and then guard the beds. When we first bought the place I would eat a few but once I realized they spawn right here I can't bring myself to eat any Bass now.  Spending 5K on Carp gear is no more crazy than spending 50K on a fishing boat and not keeping any for the table, is it?  Even crazier is spending over 30 grand on a used cruiser that never leaves it's slip because of the cost of fuel. An old saying was "" If you have to ask how many miles per gallon a Cadillac gets you can't afford one."""
900989,manitoubass2,2015-03-02 16:37:00,11391," I watch them bed here too when the water is clear.  Its actually pretty cool to watch them. They get nasty, even a stick floats by in the river and theyll hit it lol"
900991,Dave Bailey,2015-03-02 16:40:00,1641,"If you want bass fishing you might want to take a trip north, Zones 1 to 9, and much of 10, are year-round seasons."
900994,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-02 16:44:00,8243,"Rick, isn't watching them the neatest thing to see? Sometimes they will hit a leaf floating by and sometimes they will ignore it. Those things can move and move fast. They will head butt carp and Gar 5 feet off the bed and be back in a few seconds. I also notice they leave the beds to feed (I will not give the time they do here). They have to feed sometimes. Feeding time they are really aggressive."
901015,Mister G,2015-03-02 17:29:00,1429,"Actually smoked bass is pretty good, so is muskie and pike."
901016,manitoubass2,2015-03-02 17:40:00,11391,Not sure of the other zones? Im in zone 5 and it changed last year. Bass is no longer year round season
