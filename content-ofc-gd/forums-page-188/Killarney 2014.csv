YouTube video editor gave me a bit of grief, so combined with my technical inadequacy it isn't as good as I wanted. But unlike the year before, the fish were there. Most were small, but even the small ones are fun. Watch at 1080p for best resolution.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li7itcrTACY&list=PL4477C43B1104E9BE&index=1"
