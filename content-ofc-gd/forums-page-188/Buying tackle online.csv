902184,msp,2015-03-08 00:50:00,1336,Landbigfish.com
902187,Lunkerhunter,2015-03-08 01:03:00,455,I buy my musky gear at Muskytackleonline.com and the odd time thornebros. Thornebros shipping is pretty expensive though.  Tough right now with the dollar the way it is. Was much cheaper for us when our dollar was closer to par with the U.S. dollar.  Also cabelas for other stuff. They have been good with me on the orders I have placed  Oh yeah one last one which is a local guy is protackle in Belleville. He now has walleye and bass sites too and great stock of baits normally
902207,mike rousseau,2015-03-08 03:45:00,4661,Right now USA stores aren't worth it... Terrible exchange plus he shipping costs...  Ive ordered like 90% of my gear in the past 6-7 years from the states and this year might be the first time i stock up in Ontario.... SAIL will be getting my business...
