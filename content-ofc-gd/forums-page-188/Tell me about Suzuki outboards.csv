901971,Joeytier,2015-03-06 17:20:00,3990,"I've got an opportunity to score a great deal on a brand new non-current (2013) 9.9 Suzuki manual start.  Having trouble finding much info on these newer motors.  I understand Suzuki's to be a fairly reputable name in the world if outboards, at least with their older 2 strokes, but these 4 strokes I don't know much about.  Any info would be appreciated, thanks."
901973,Cosmos,2015-03-06 17:33:00,588,"Very reliable motor, friend of mine is using one for last couple years. Very happy with it."
901980,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-06 17:52:00,10439,Haven't heard of any issues with Zukes.
901981,lew,2015-03-06 17:53:00,12766,Never owned one myself but anybody that has one is very happy with it.
901990,John Bacon,2015-03-06 18:49:00,3277,Suzuki made the Johnson four strokes.  They are a good motor.  The only downside is that there are not as many dealers as Mercury or Yamaha.
901992,Joeytier,2015-03-06 18:57:00,3990,"I have a dealer about an hour south of me in Bonfield, which is where the motor is being sold from.  Sounds like my decision is all but made.  The motor is priced at $2000 for brand new non-current 9.9, which is good considering that I'm seeing 2-4 year old Merc 8 and 9.9's going for upwards of $2500!"
901997,2 tone z71,2015-03-06 19:24:00,1311,As much as I love the yammy outboards ..if I could have last summer I'd a bought the suzi..great motors ..sweet find ..good deal ..congrats

902029,Roe Bag,2015-03-06 22:27:00,246,Very reliable motor. I've owned two Suzies. 1995 15 hp two stroke oil injected. 2001 15 hp four stroke. Both were absolutely flawless. No issues whatsoever.
902033,chris.brock,2015-03-06 22:41:00,4053,"Before I bought my used pontoon, I was looking at a new one with a 40hp Suzuki 4 stroke. I researched it and liked what I was hearing. I would buy a Suzuki. I didn't buy it because I cheaped out and went for a used boat."
902040,Big Cliff,2015-03-06 23:21:00,6899,"Well, don't know if this will help but I had a 1980 55hp oil injected. Sold it about 5 years ago now when I bought my new boat and motor and it was still running like a top!"
