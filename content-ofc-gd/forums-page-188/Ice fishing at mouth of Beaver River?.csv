902077,Cameron92,2015-03-07 04:45:00,4,Has anyone ever done any hard water fishing at the mouth of the Beaver River near Collingwood? Is the ice safe there? My buddy wants to go up there tomorrow but I've never liked ice fishing rivers.

902143,Freshtrax,2015-03-07 20:02:00,2215,The beaver flows pretty quick at the mouth.   I don't think it would be safe at all.
902164,Cameron92,2015-03-07 22:15:00,4,"It was the indian brook he was talking about. Ice shifted quite a bit and jammed up on the shore. That was enough for me, got outta there pretty quick lol."

I can tell you from experience that it is very dangerous and not advisable and yes , I have learned my lesson"

One guy ventured out quite a ways, and thought he would never make it back.  We were in about 4 feet of water.  I dont need to catch a fish that badly.  Those days are over.  Plenty of time during open water season."
