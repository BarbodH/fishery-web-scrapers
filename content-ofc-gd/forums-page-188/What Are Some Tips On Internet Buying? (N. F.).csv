Too bad all your information is already on the ""internet"" in multiple places too. How you ask? Every bank, government payment from or to you, utility service, you have paid for by debit, cash, cheque or charge, in the the last 10yrs for sure was entered and IS online in one form or another.  Most store transactions wind up online too unless you paid cash and refused to give your name....  Here is another one that will shock you. There are no physical property deeds in Ontario anymore they are out there in cyberspace now (heard this just yesterday when the lawyer came to have my parents sign off on the deal for selling their house) When you buy a property now you just get a code to access a digital copy of your deed... Unless the lawyer was wrong. LOL.  Lastly as of 2016 all your government payments will only be made to you by direct deposit, which is done over the ""internet"". Soon after that you will HAVE to file your taxes electronically online too or your accountant will.  https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CDUQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ctvnews.ca%2Fby-2016-no-more-government-cheques-by-mail-1.794886&ei=XWj3VNiCEa6asQS0mYDwBQ&usg=AFQjCNHJsIv7ZBhXAjjhV1eTGZCkU-H_5w&bvm=bv.87519884,d.aWw"
901593,Andy,2015-03-04 20:23:00,330,"1. For online purchases, stick with reputable big name companies if you can. I deal with Cabela's, Bass Pro, Rollie and Helens Musky shop,  and other reputable retailers. I still like to call a company first and talk to a real person who understands my language and what I'm talking about. (without getting politically incorrect) 2. Have and use a credit card with a very low limit and use that credit card specifically for internet purchases. It's not like you'll ever purchase items worth many thousands of dollars sight unseen over the internet. This way if your card info is stolen or used inappropriately, your losses are minimized by your low limit. 3. Be careful who you give the code to at the back of the card. Again, you should deal with creditable companies. If you are scammed or your info is stolen and used, the financial institution will often refund the loss. But I have heard of more cases recently where the bank or credit card will not reimburse you after you have given up all your info to some scammer. Although misled, you did so voluntarily and it's considered your problem. Same goes for if you give your debit card PIN to someone and they make unauthorized withdrawals from your account. 4. Nigerian scams often involve wire money transfers.  Be very cautious when asked to forwarded any funds thru a wire transfer. You can consider that money gone for good if you have been scammed. Occasionally the money is picked up in Ontario and you may have a very slim chance of finding out who picked up your money, but if it's outside of the province or outside the country, you are screwed."
901596,cheaptackle,2015-03-04 20:27:00,849,"Internet ordering can be both a headache and a pleasant cost saving experience if you do your homework. For something like 7.00 per year I have a prepaid BMO mastercard I use just for this purpose.  IF there were to be any problems it's only good for the balance i put on it and no more than that.  Plus if I have any issues the usual card holder's protection applies. But to feel a bit more secure about who or what I may be ordering from I try and find independent site reviews on the product and the seller. If the seller's site only shows POSITIVE reviews I'm usually a little more leery than if there were at least some ""lesser"" reviews. When it's something I may want to order frequently I'll try a small initial order if it's practical to do (not always) before I pull the trigger and go nuts. As for ordering from CA and shipping from GA - that could be a good sign if you think about it, multiple locations means better established business and larger available inventory to draw on. Then there's always the option to ask for input from members on sites like this...someone somewhere might just have done whatever you're thinking of and has specific experience to relate to you - I see it all the time on here! Watch out for shipping and border clearance (customs) charges - especially with UPS and FEDEX, always go with USPS when you can.  Canada Post charges 9.95 for customs clearance and collects the HST on any items it clears.  I've heard horror stories on here about customs costing over 100.00, plus HST plus shipping, often exceeding the value of the item!  Michael"
901598,Andy,2015-03-04 20:35:00,330,The prepaid credit card for online purchases if a great idea. You only lose what you have put on it.
901599,GBW,2015-03-04 20:38:00,8460,"When in doubt, use a pre-paid credit card.  If you know you are about to buy a $100 item then go pick up a pre-paid card and use it so they can not take more cash than the $100 on the card."
901606,cheaptackle,2015-03-04 21:13:00,849,"Guess I should've mentioned mine is reloadable thru my bank account so I can keep the balance exactly where I want it to be.  No user fees beyond the 7.00 per year although it does count as an item when I transfer money onto to it from chequing, but I get something like 10 items free each month so that doesn't really bother me.  I can do all that from my computer without having to go out and purchase one of the other ones - just something I find a lot more convenient.  AND because it's issued from a bank I deal with I have full cardholder protection just like a regular credit card, not sure how even the prepaid VISA ones handle that, but it's something I don't have to consider an additional worry. While I don't order as much now, since I started using this method a few years back (when I was still operating) I haven't had even one problem other than a short shipped item which was immediately credited back to the card once I notified the vendor.

I have enough stuff, actually I need to get rid of some of the crap I bought in my life.

Also, Paypal is the best way to purchase anything online.  They have their own customer protection in place on top of what the credit card companies offer.  Stick with the big online retailers and smaller ones with a reputation.  As for CC problems.  I have a lower limit card dedicated for online shopping.   You know what?  That card has NEVER been compromised, but all my other cards (debit and CC) have been several times (one just the other day in fact).   It's just as Irishfield said, gas stations are the worst culprits."

I don't think they have any advantage in sending them.  With my printer, I don't have to scan pages to be faxes later.  I can just set the printer to fax and send the pages directly.  It has a sheet feeder, so I can send multiple pages in one fax.  It may be able to receive faxes too; I have just never bothered looking into that feature."
