902400,LostAnotherOne,2015-03-09 00:56:00,956,Nothing beats setting up a tent with crazy winds.  Came close a few times on losing it.  Good catch
902406,Joeytier,2015-03-09 01:22:00,3990,5 whities in some tough conditions doesn't sound too shabby.  Nice job again
902415,Acountdeleted,2015-03-09 01:58:00,2562,Oh man. Some beauties right there.
902417,irishfield,2015-03-09 02:18:00,26272,You buy peanut oil by the 45 gallon drum Emil?
902420,icefisherman,2015-03-09 02:26:00,952,"Haha Wayne....nope but I buy the lump charcoal by the truck load This reminds me I need to restock for this batch...  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

902442,northernpike56,2015-03-09 05:28:00,717,I've never even caught a whitefish so I'd be pretty stoked to get 3 whitefish in a day lol. Nice haul!!
902458,Ronzo,2015-03-09 12:57:00,124,"Nice whities! Awesome that your son is already pulling them up by himself!  I got bitten by the weatherman being wrong last Thursday. Seemed calm, got the hut halfway open, without anchors in, when the gusts started. Anyone see an idiot chasing an orange portable for a few hundred meters in Sandy Cove? That was me, folks! Missed it three times then finally grabbed a corner, dragged it back and used the pegs this time."
902460,Basschaser77,2015-03-09 13:05:00,32,Nice catch! So far I've been skunked but good to see the kids doing well.
902632,manjo39,2015-03-10 01:53:00,354,"Great day when you can spend a day like that with your son.  Well done.  After 100 whiteys, it may be time to sharpen that Meegs hook"
902636,Moosebunk,2015-03-10 02:13:00,3970,The lad and his dad put the beat on a few beauties.  Nice!
