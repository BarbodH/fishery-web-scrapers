Also, after picking up our dog at my bro-in-law's in Ports of Newcastle, I noticed a new hunting and fishing store (Easthill ?) on the east side of the 35/115 highway...anybody been in there ?"

900939,Beans,2015-03-02 12:51:00,3339,It is about half way up from the 401 Hwy to the 35 cut-off...looks like a new building...
900942,lew,2015-03-02 12:59:00,12766,Can't place it Norm but there's been a lot of changes around there in the last few years.
900948,bigbuck,2015-03-02 13:18:00,2449,I saw that last week on the way to Peterborough. Looked like a fairly nice store from the outside. Good luck to them.
900998,Dave Bailey,2015-03-02 16:53:00,1641,"They had a grand opening last year, haven't stopped in myself. I'm wondering if they're affiliated with Boatland, they're immediately next to it. Web site:  http://easthilloutdoors.com/"
901007,misfish,2015-03-02 17:10:00,29133,I don't see any fishing stuff Norm.  Looks like a nice store from the web site.
901012,esoxansteel,2015-03-02 17:20:00,1307,"East hill does have fishing stuff, i thought they looked like huts in the 2nd Marsh Bay just east of the GM office, but im not so sure now, they looked like clumps of hay or straw on the 2nd look, didnt want to stop the truck on the 401 to pull the Binocks for a closer look, thats just asking for trouble, never seen anyone outside if they are in fact huts, might be monitoring something ie water, and using hay or straw to insulate to keep holes from freezing."
901014,lew,2015-03-02 17:23:00,12766,"Thanks for the link Dave, I recognize the place now but I guess just never payed much attention to it before. Been travelling up and down that road for 60 years and thought I knew every place on it LOL"
901024,Dave Bailey,2015-03-02 18:08:00,1641,"I'm betting they were wondering which side of the road would be better. Do we put it on the northbound side, to get all the guys who forgot stuff? Or on the southbound, to get all the guys who lost stuff?"
901102,Sinker,2015-03-03 00:43:00,8692,"East hill is just north of the 4th concession. Not a bad little shop. They're hunting section is pretty good, great gun room. The fishing section was OK last time I was there, but I havent been back since. I heard its better now though. I drive by it every day and forget to stop in.  S."
901107,Handlebarz,2015-03-03 00:49:00,3790,East hill is a great little store they did not have any musky grear but were told about our stuff and after a couple phone calls I took a drive up and delivered the first order. They listen to the customers and get in what is needed. They have a large gun and bow selection. This year they will have a great fishing selection.

I don't think fishing is allowed on Second Marsh.  Darlington Provincial park has a bay just east of Second Marsh."
901126,Sinker,2015-03-03 04:02:00,8692," For a new shop, they are doing it right. There not much around here in the way of outdoor stores, so I hope they stick around.  They also have an indoor archery range. Pretty slick too!  S."
901193,Beans,2015-03-03 16:21:00,3339,Thanks for the info guys !...My bro-in-law was asking as he passes the marsh every day on his way home and lives not too far away in Ports of Newcastle...
901196,Fang,2015-03-03 16:43:00,1330,Think the huts are set up on McLaughlin Bay. Similar to Frenchman's Bay. Very good carp there in the summer but it gets super weedy
901200,misfish,2015-03-03 16:56:00,29133,"I was just going by the web site. They show no fishing stuff. I,ll be over that way this summer. Will have to drop in."

901208,Locnar,2015-03-03 17:31:00,645,Lots of Carp n Catfish. I caught a white perch in there last spring... really caught me by surprise
901214,Sinker,2015-03-03 17:40:00,8692,"Drop in at my place on the way thru. If you plan it right, I can take ya fishing. I guarantee fish too  S."
901232,misfish,2015-03-03 18:47:00,29133,You can pull me around on my toon Shane.LOL

Fishing stuff is on there, but not easy to find. On the home page click on 'Search Store' in the upper right, and then go to 'Products'. They really need to redo that web site for better navigation. There are waaaaay more people who fish than hunt, they need to target better."
901437,Sinker,2015-03-04 02:47:00,8692,"They are targeting hunting and doing well in that department. Its a great shop, just need to addd some more fishing gear. They will. They seem to bbe good at pleasing customers. I should stop in there more often, im probably missing out on some good stuff."
902012,Locnar,2015-03-06 20:28:00,645,"Found out what those things on Mclaughlin Bay are, they aren't fish huts, nor bales of Hay. They're christmas trees. The city of Oshawa collects them and stacks them out there instead of composting them."
