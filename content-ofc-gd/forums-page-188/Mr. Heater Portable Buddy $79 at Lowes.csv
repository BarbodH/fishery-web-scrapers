901769,manjo39,2015-03-05 18:17:00,354,Just picked up the Mr. Heater Portable Buddy 4000-9000BTU at Lowes on clearance for $79.00.  The link shows the wrong picture.  The one I bought for $79.00 is the traditional red one that we're all familiar with. http://www.lowes.ca/portable-heaters/mr-heater-9000-btu-portable-buddy-outdoor-radiant-liquid-propane-heater_g1646716.html?ProductSlot=16
901780,Fang,2015-03-05 19:26:00,1330,"I saw that on line this morning as I was looking for an alternative to my Coleman Black Cat.  I did bump across this mini BBQ that really perked my interest too  http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/master-chef-round-tabletop-gas-bbq-0853605p.html#.VPisfPnF_Lc  It's supposed to be a clone of the Coleman RoadTrip Party Grill but has 10,000 BTU. At 15"" wide it's a little bigger than my BlackCat but will fit inside my plastic tote with a couple of 1 lb bottles.  Always wanted to have the ability to heat the hut and cook out there. Time to load up on some Johnsonville sausages!"
