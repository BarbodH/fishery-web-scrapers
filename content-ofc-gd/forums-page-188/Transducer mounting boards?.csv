901267,landry,2015-03-03 21:36:00,1005,"Anyone have any idea where I can find 3/4 or 1 "" thick plastic to mount my transducers on the transom? Thanks"
901275,Fisherpete,2015-03-03 22:08:00,1814,"What size do you need? I am thinking of doing the same thing for my boat this year and may have something at work. I think it is the right thickness, will check tomorrow.  Pete"
901277,misfish,2015-03-03 22:09:00,29133,"Yup, if you can pick up in Barrie. No charge for you."
901301,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-03 22:48:00,10439,"I used a 1/2"" thick piece of UHMW on my boat. Picked up an off cut at a plastic place fer cheap. Way better than spending the $$$$ they want for the ones made expressly for the job. Like this one from BPS for $20. http://www.basspro.com/Transducer-Mounting-Plate/product/9153/  I think I paid 1/2 that for a piece that would make 2 boards."
901334,bare foot wader,2015-03-03 23:44:00,1354,"I looked up a local plastics company, told them what I wanted, told me to poke through the scrap bin for free, if I didn't find anything I liked it was $25 for 1' x 1' of 1"" hdpe...I found a suitable scrap piece"
901336,landry,2015-03-03 23:47:00,1005,"Thanks Pete. I appreciate it. Don't know how wide and long I really need. I think it needs to be thicker than 1/2"" to safely hold down the huge SI ducer I am installing. Landry"
901341,irishfield,2015-03-03 23:50:00,26272,"Mine are 1/2""...  haven't lost a transducer or either speed wheel yet at 50+MPH"

901439,landry,2015-03-04 02:57:00,1005,Thanks guys
901453,Dan668,2015-03-04 03:26:00,1120,"I have a spare 1/2"" board. Its light gray in colour. Ive used 1/2"" for a few years with an lss2, skimmer transducer. Thought i needed thicker also but its been good so far."
901457,landry,2015-03-04 03:41:00,1005,Where are u located Dan???
901460,landry,2015-03-04 03:46:00,1005,Did u guys adhere//seal the whole boards or just seal the drill holes/screws? And - what's your best advice on mounting SI ducers on alyminum hulls? There is less info on aluminum than bass boats out there. Thanks again? Landry
901471,porkpie,2015-03-04 04:17:00,2521,"I mounted my last one solely with 3M 5200, I didn't use any screws.  That was in 2004.  My buddy still owns that boat, and the board is still there.  I will be doing another one this spring on my new to me rig, with a Raymarine transducer that is similar in size to an LSS2 transducer.  I won't be using screws this time either.  Just an option to consider."
901486,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-04 06:37:00,8243,I bought a $2.00 small cutting board at the Dollarama. It isn't 3/4 but it must be 5/8's. Glued to well cleaned aluminum transom with 3M. Never a problem after 6 years.
901493,scugpg,2015-03-04 10:56:00,1373,Used this along with 3M 5200 and two machine screws  http://berts-tackle.shptron.com/p/transducer-mounting-board-artic-white?pp=8
901494,steelhedrmatt,2015-03-04 11:05:00,278,What u have Brian??  How thick?  I also will be looking for a piece in spring for my LSS2 ducer.
901538,Cosmos,2015-03-04 16:03:00,588,I bought mine in Fishing Depot on 401 last year - $20. Dollarama boards are good for couple years only.
901560,Dan668,2015-03-04 18:03:00,1120,"Thats what mine looks like.  Was from a dealer,  pretty sure its the same thing.  Im by dixie/qew landry."
901562,Paudash,2015-03-04 18:25:00,273,"great topic, thanks to all as I will be doing mine as well as soon as I can get the boat out of storage"
901572,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-04 19:29:00,8243,"Costa I must be lucky, many years now on that boat of mine! 4 of those years in a Marina."
902022,Fisherpete,2015-03-06 21:33:00,1814,"Crap - forgot to measure it - the stuff I have at work (I forgot to measure, will tomorrow) is at least 3/4"" if not 1"" thick. I'll take some measurements tomorrow. Can get a few pieces for whoever wants some."
902023,misfish,2015-03-06 21:50:00,29133,What u have Brian?? How thick? I also will be looking for a piece in spring for my LSS2 ducer.  Give a shout when you need it. 1/2 inch or thicker if you want. Terry used it on his boat.
902046,Cosmos,2015-03-07 00:15:00,588,That's great. I knew couple people who had dollarama boards and they failed a part.
