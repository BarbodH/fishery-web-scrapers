901730,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-05 15:07:00,8243,"I've been known to hog the mic during Karaoke night so I will sing a few tunes, Proud Mary, Nesun Dorma,  O sole Mio, Baby It's Cold Outside, a mixed bag of sweet serenades. My wife always asks if I know "" Far, Far, Away?"" because she always says go sing far, far away.  Rarely I turn on the CD player but when I do it's always the sound track of Oh Brother Were Art Thou? Always, never fail, because that CD is stuck in it."
901738,Acountdeleted,2015-03-05 15:54:00,2562,Sounds like when I go fishing too. Often times 'I am a man of constant sorrow'
901742,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-05 16:02:00,8243,Gotta love The Soggy Bottom Boys. With a name like that the music has to be good. I don't think Hip Hop and Fishing should ever be used in the same sentence.
898921,Acountdeleted,2015-02-18 23:30:00,2562,"No sense being shy, we have all done it, especially us ice fishermen. What song do you think or sing or hum when you are retrieving your lure?  For me, the song 'shake and pop' tells me exactly what to do. And finicky fish seem to love the movement."
898927,misfish,2015-02-19 00:07:00,29133,Ok I just searched that song. You must of attended a few RAVE parties. LOL  I can dig it though. LOL

898941,Acountdeleted,2015-02-19 00:39:00,2562,This is true! With how well we fared after this song this should be my 'fire me up' music. This Saturday we need this song to be on repeat for the full 3 hour drive.

898972,Steve,2015-02-19 02:48:00,2075,"well, when we are spring time fishing, in the shallows for browns and kings, we are often in the mood for floyd, neil young, or the who.when we are deep water fishing in June and July, its ballz out rock. AC/DC, Zeppelin, Aerosmith, etc.when are up north bass fishing, generally we start out in deep silence. But around 8am ish dad'll throw in some moody blues or the guess who.once he goes in for his afternoon nap, I head out solo. That's when I throw on some Metheny, Miles Davis, or even some Phish.On my boat, music is part of the fishing."
898994,Handlebarz,2015-02-19 10:56:00,3790,When were out musky fishing and grab the good ol pink/chartuesse bait I make you have to song it's name Disco Inferno. Burn baby burn
899035,Beavertail,2015-02-19 14:55:00,331,"Back in the day before we had cars and driver licences, my buddies older brother would take us fishing occasionally. He had an old, crappy Cavalier with a custom Blaupunkt stereo system installed that was worth more than the car. It was customary to play the original theme song from the 'Fishin Canada Show' to start every trip....he always had the volume cranked to the max and while sitting in the back seat it felt like my head would explode. Ahhhhh, good times!"
899046,AKRISONER,2015-02-19 15:27:00,5558,more of an album for me than one particular song. Although sadly TLDR my buddy is being forced to go back to australia so this tradition will be dead  G-Funk Classics....best theme music for G-funk fishing   And then when im bass fishing with the boys its definitely Deuces are Wild by Aerosmith

899167,bigugli,2015-02-20 00:32:00,6138,  Same here. Only music on the water is the songs playing in my head.

We had put a good 7-8 hours into trolling around, without a sniff from Mrs. Pickereye. We were less than an hour from sunset and frankly, pretty darned bored. I think FnS suggested a little music to help bust the cob webs outta our heads and turned on the radio. AC/DC Back in Black was playing and with a minute or two, we had a fish on! Yes, at almost 12lbs, it was his new PB! HH"
