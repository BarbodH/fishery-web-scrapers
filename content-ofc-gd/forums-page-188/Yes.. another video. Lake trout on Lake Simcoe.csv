I just so happened to stumble upon this lure at tackle shop and thought I'd give it a try, as another option to the X-zone Swammer.Only a couple fish landed but a day out is better than a day in..Hope you enjoy, and I hope I can pump out some more videos (too much work and no time for play!).

902020,DanD,2015-03-06 20:54:00,2223,"  Dan.  @jds63; it was the fish and video I was praising, that Kevin posted; not that you lost your fish. Sorry!!!!  Dan."
902021,Fisherpete,2015-03-06 21:25:00,1814,Cool video - love the underwater battle shots.  jds63 - I use 10lb powerpro braid as my main line and 10 feet of 20lb floro leader - have never had it break on the ice.

Terrific video, well done, I still can't figure out how to post pics on here lol let alone a video, thanks for posting For the youtube video, you just copy and paste the URL and it shows up in the post  great video guys ... what length fluoro leader do you use ?  i lost a monster up in Temagami a few weeks ago, ice was 20 inches thick and laker cut me off on the edge of the ice, had a fluoro leader ... was really pissed off to say the least... now i wonder if i really need it , just tie directly to braid The leader i have on is quite long, 20-30ft. It is a must? I don't think so, but it doesn't hurt. I have yet to have my leader break on me for ice fishing."
