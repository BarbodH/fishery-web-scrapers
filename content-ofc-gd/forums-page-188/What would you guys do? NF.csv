901539,Beans,2015-03-04 16:04:00,3339,No Hunting...Vegetarian...Fishing?...sounds like P3TA propaganda to me...  My wife stopped eating meat after taking a  nutrition course but will eat dairy and fish...We also have a grandson that is a vegetarian so when they come for dinner we heat up some firm tofu with Shake and Bake for the both of them...  My wife makes a great hamburger stew with Yyeves ground round meat substitute that I enjoy also...  She is not against hunting or fishing just doesn't do it herself...
901580,fish_fishburn,2015-03-04 19:40:00,1311,"You might want to tell her that the human body cant exist and stay healthy on vegetables alone. She will be deficient in minerals, vitamins and e,f,a, (essential fatty acids). I have a friend whose father passed away at 62 yrs old and was a vegan since 32 yrs old. Died from clogged arteries. Ate no meat or dairy. His M.D. gave him this advice. Personally a M.D. is the last person I would ask for advice on nutrition. But what do I know I eat close to 2 doz eggs a week and use as much salt as required to make my food taste good. I don't drink milk or any carbonated soft drinks, no nitrates and have never had a prescription filled since I left home at 18. Im 54 now and don't need Viagra either. Seems to be working for me lol. I forgot to mention if I have to fry anything I use a big chunk of good old butter. No margarine for this guy, That stuff is pure poison. Just my 2 cents."
901693,ch312,2015-03-05 05:50:00,1590,"I would begin by finding out where she learned about this stuff in the first place as it's rather unfortunate that some people have no problem lying to children in hopes of spreading their beliefs. I would then find out what she thinks happens to animals from birth to slaughter and teach her that animals cannot be compared to humans and how different they are.   I noticed quite a few people saying she should just be left alone to do as she pleases. IMO you don't just ignore major decisions such as this without learning why the child came to the decision in the first place, especially when the child was raised in a household where hunting and fishing is normal. Clearly something or someone is influencing her enough to make her think what her dad does is wrong.  Dig deep and get answers. I think some people are forgetting that a 10 year old child can choose to be a vegetarian and dislike animal killers simply because Suzy said so. No logical reason, simply because someone she likes or can relate too said so."
901714,anders,2015-03-05 13:53:00,1168,"Pick you battles.....i would try to teach the difference between hunting and animals that have lived free and animals that end up in the grocery store?  You are definitly in a tough spot, but i think overall support is what she will probably need.....although us dad do need to stick together"
901731,jimmer,2015-03-05 15:07:00,2730,"Maybe you can persuade her to change to a topic like freedom of choice and she can use her choice to not eat meat as one example, or maybe a bigger picture topic of respecting our planet earth and her contribution is not to eat meat. Maybe she can remove the word BAD from her speech because she sounds like a very smart girl that should understand other's points of view. Shooting down her choice completely might send the wrong message."
901733,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-05 15:33:00,10439,"Mike You might want to let her know that not all trophy hunting is bad. For instance in Africa the tag fees are used for conservation and enforcement and without the ""trophy hunters"" it is very likely that rhino and elephants would disappear in short order. When a trophy hunter goes to Africa to hunt elephant just the cost of the tags are in the range of $25,000.  Now those high fence hunts they do a lot of in the US. Yeah, those suck."
901734,bare foot wader,2015-03-05 15:39:00,1354,"I would try to educate her on the concept of sustainable hunting, harvest vs growth rates, population management, and reasons to promote predator control...show her the other side of the fence, that anti hunters don't ever touch on....regardless of her hunting opinion, sounds like a smart girl, she might be outsmarting you soon enough!"
901740,Acountdeleted,2015-03-05 15:58:00,2562,"In truest honesty though I think our fellow board members speak a lot of sense. My girlfriend refuses to eat anything factory farmed because of the poor living conditions but will gladly eat eithicly farmed animals or things that were hunted or fished. She feels they lived a happy life and 'we all have to die sometime' I can respect and support that.  Adding on to what others have said, perhaps talk to your daughter about the spring bear hunt or areas where they are overrun with deer and allow hunting to help control the population. Those are always my best debates when I talk to vegetarians on the subject.  Personally, when I die, I hope they throw me to the wolves or something like that. Nature has given so much to me, it's the least I can do in return rather then letting my 'meat' go to waste."
901744,AKRISONER,2015-03-05 16:24:00,5558,"the idea of population control hunts are only done because humans screwed up the system in the first place.  Eat what you hunt.  Polar Bear hunting is legal too, you are an A hole if you do it though."
901746,akaShag,2015-03-05 16:34:00,2073,"I am sure that quite a number of Inuit hunters would be surprised to know that they have been branded an ""A hole"" for a traditional hunting activity. I am also fairly certain that the Inuit communities who benefit from ""southern"" hunters coming up for a polar bear hunt would also be nonplussed by this moniker..............  Hunters have enough enemies already from the anti-hunting types.  We do not need fellow hunters pointing fingers at LEGAL hunting practices, just because they do not agree with them.  Just my opinion.............but one that I have come to believe in over close to fifty years of hunting...............  Doug"
901747,solopaddler,2015-03-05 16:35:00,8605,"Thanks for everyone's input!  I've been on this board a long time and this is the first time I've ever been the creator of one of those stupidly long non fishing threads. The kind that gets 10x the number of views and responses than a fishing report that took you several days to create LOL!  I've always thought it's kind of funny that a thread like ""what's your favourite bbq sauce"" can get 100 times more responses than something you poured your heart and soul into.  Everyone has an opinion though and I have enjoyed reading them.  Cheers"
901750,Ronzo,2015-03-05 17:06:00,124,"I would actually consider her view to be incredibly compassionate, and you should be proud she holds such a view. Two hundred years from now it would not surprise me one bit if over 50% of the population was vegan/vegetarian, for a variety of reasons. Laugh if you want, but things like dairy allergies are on the rise.  My wife has been a vegan for several years. It doesn't cause a problem around our house. If I want to eat meat, I will eat the quality stuff, not the factory farmed garbage that you find in grocery stores.  I always say to my Dad, the milk and meat that you're getting these days isn't the same stuff you were getting back in the 60's and 70's. Making money is the endgame now."
901751,bigugli,2015-03-05 17:10:00,6138,"It may not be a ""fishing thread"", but the topic does hit close to home. No real difference tween harvesting animals or fish. Glad to read the daughter amended her topic somewhat. We all love the outdoors one way or another, despite everyone's differing lines in the sand. Like they say, sand moves."
901758,bare foot wader,2015-03-05 17:32:00,1354,"the idea of population control hunts are only done because humans screwed up the system in the first place.  Eat what you hunt.  Polar Bear hunting is legal too, you are an A hole if you do it though.  typical ignorant statement...  what do you think anti's think of fishing? and catch and release fishing and mortality rates? do you think every single fish you've released has survived? if you're not keeping your catch and stopping when you hit your limit, why bother fishing, purely for the entertainment of the fight?"

So AKRISONER, how very good of you to label LEGAL hunters as ""A hole"" types.  And how very kind of you to show your immense superiority over persons who eat fish, which last time I looked was not only LEGAL but one of the primary reasons MILLIONS of people fish.  Maybe the person wanting to validate his manhood is the person putting down other outdoors folks whose views are not congruent with yours.  Pretty much penis-waving from the looks of it."
901771,lew,2015-03-05 18:27:00,12766,It's always unfortunate when a very interesting discussion goes completely off track and takes a nosedive into the mud.
901772,Acountdeleted,2015-03-05 18:35:00,2562,"Let's try to get this back on track.  I always say that if humans were the only species to eat meat, I would agree we are in the wrong. But many many species on this planet do it.  I have heard the arguement that we need to be better because we have conscious of animals suffering. That is why it is important to not torture or further harm what you eat or kill.  I feel as though eating and killing a few animals and fish will not bring this world to it's end, it's been happening for years. Spilling oil and dropping bombs is what will."
901774,AKRISONER,2015-03-05 18:55:00,5558,"ill point out that I fish, and hunt and eat as well. Thats not my point...there is a large difference between hunting/fishing and eating (i eat pickerel, pike and venison all the time) vs shooting an endangered or threatened animal whos population is on the decline simply because you want to feel good about yourself. Its immoral. Many things are ""legal"" does that make it right?  Dont try to play the ""native spiritual rights"" Bull either. Letting white men pay to take their resources has a long history with the natives.  Put me on blast all you want, if you are of the group that says that going and shooting a polar bear or rhino is a good idea we wouldnt get along in person anyways aha.  I think my point in all of this is that the original author's daughter has an opinion that many people share. I cant believe a 10 year old is carrying such a strong point of view, clearly someone has probably shown her an online vegan propaganda video, or maybe just like many other people, they get grossed out when they see what it actually takes to kill an animal for harvest.  Vegans can keep eating moss, more steaks for me."
901779,bare foot wader,2015-03-05 19:22:00,1354,"if thing stay well mannered, perhaps there's some ideas that could be used in the girls speech    are you stating that you are one of them?

Theres plenty of other things to do with your time besides trying to validate your manhood by shooting threatened and endangered animals.  I'm not one of them, I mostly c&r but I do keep a fish if I don't think it'll survive, even if my intentions weren't to bring any home that day (I think a lot of bass anglers should reconsider their handling techniques too)  I shoot coyotes and wolves any chance I get, and I don't eat them, I do skin them (my coyote hunting skills are far superior to my wolf skills lol)  you said ""eat what you hunt""...I'm asking you if you eat what you fish, because all the fish you release do not survive...so why do you fish for them? you're killing fish purely for the personal enjoyment of the fight...that is the mindset anti's have, if you think anti's don't have an agenda with fishing the same as hunting, you're wrong....anglers pointing fingers at hunters (trophy or meat hunters) is pretty pathetic IMO  the thing many don't consider is sustainability of the harvest, and the dollars that hunting puts back to conservation...how much money and effort has groups like P3TA invested in actually protecting wild spaces? rehabilitation work? they are narrow mindedly focused only on the killing aspect...do they protect marshlands like DU does? do they do streamside work in rivers?  well managed trophy hunting, including hunts for threatened species, puts dollars back into conservation  read this article, do you see the Humane Society offering to donate 350K to help fund conservancy programs?  http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/16/us/black-rhino-hunting-permit/"

901429,Joeytier,2015-03-04 02:27:00,3990,"Some interesting opinions here.  Some people seem to talk like anyone getting into vegetarianism has automatically been swayed by misguided/misinformed opinions.  I would argue that most people that opt out of eating meat have done far more research on food production than the average non-outdoorsperson that consumes lots of factory meat.  I guess a lot of people associate vegetarianism/veganism with people and organizations that pose a threat to hunting/fishing, and I don't believe that's true in many cases.  Many people I know that have tread down the path have done it for 'green' reasons (carbon footprint and all that good stuff) as well as all the typical ethical reasons pertaining to factory animal rearing, and quite honestly, I have nothing but respect for their choices, just as they respect mine to harvest animals from the wild.  At least they belong to the ever-shrinking percentage of our population that actually has strong convictions and a passion for something.  Anyways, glad your daughter has come around Mike!"

Beatle hat, black shirt with a black dickie and black Beatle boots. I got a black Beatle belt  beating from my father and the spoon on the back of my legs from my mother. I think my Noni got in a few good licks too. To this day my favorite clothing is black, from suits to t shirts.  Let the girl form her own opinions, as long as no one is being hurt by them I really don't see the big deal here Mike.

Good or bad? No idea. I personally dont like it.  Thats why we spend our time cooking, out in nature, fishing, beading etc.  I hate to say it, but when my grandmothers passed, the whole family dynamic changed.  We try to be more ""traditional"", but things still creep in and we debate. Thats a great thing to do with your family.  For better or for worse, we as parents can only do our best to educate our children before they embark on their own paths.  Im 35 and almost grey already. Its stressful. But I love my family and thats all you can really do.  Educate, put your foot down when needed, show alot of love and compassion, support their goals and desires, and just hope at the end of the day they still love you lol.  Being a parent is a blessing and a curse. It will show you the best and worst in yourself. Try you at every corner, make you cry, make you proud, make you question everything.

901473,cram,2015-03-04 04:20:00,1733,"Let me add -- one thing I have pointed to friends who are anti fishing or hunting is how fishermen and hunters are often the first to donate their $ or time to causes around wildlife conservation.

It's a mixed blessing from what I've observed (nieces, nephews, god kids etc), but kids are growing up faster today and in general, are more articulate than when I was a kid roaming my small Ontario town at 4 years old. She may not stay vegetarian or she may, no harm if she does as long as she's making sure she's got her nutrition bases covered.  I believe kids who can make this type of decision at that age bodes well for their future imo. Often times it's the ones who go against the grain who stand head and shoulders above the rest.

You poster child giving a speach that basically explains that she doesn't agree with your hunting and fishing lifestyle...  But as others have said she has her opinion and it's hers... Not yours...  The speach would be the least of my worries tho... I'd be more concerned about how she feels about you and your practices with fish and game... Talk to her and ask her what she thinks about the activities you do to harvest meat... You don't have to see eye to eye on how you each wanna live your life...

First step for me would be to book an appointment with her teacher to find if the change was initiated through some discussions or course work she was involved with. I would also ask the teacher for some insight into how she works in class and her interactions at school. We all think we know our kids inside and out, but I know how they interact with other kids is not something I have intimate knowledge of. I would also ask their advice, simply because as a professional, they have education and experience dealing with kid's challenges. You don't have to take their advice, but it can't hurt to have more ammunition, so to speak. I have an 11 year old daughter at home and like your daughter, she's 11 going on 30! She has a toughness that my son could only dream about having and the last thing I would want to do as a parent, is stifle that piss and vinegar. Gather more info is my best suggestion.

901521,msp,2015-03-04 14:50:00,1336,"Mike, I will have to get back to you on this one. I have a Vegan wife ( who is a nutritionist ), and two vegan daughters ( 14 and 16 ) And a bacon eating non vegetarian son ( 8 yrs ) I will have to consult with the wife and get back with an educated response. I have a lot of experience dealing with this You may be over reacting IMO"
901527,Musky or Specks,2015-03-04 15:27:00,2710,"Your daughter Mike, when we met,struck me as a strong individual. You should be proud of that. Think of it this way. If she has the will and the strength to stand up to a father she respects and loves she should always have the strength and ability to be an Island in the storm and that no matter what crap life throws at her she'll still be there standing stromg after the storms have past. As for her speech she has come up on her own with what I was going to suggest and that is that during the speech present both sides of the arguement and explain why she has come to her conclusions. She is about to enter middle school mike ...GOOD LUCK."

This is obviously something she strongly believes in. What you wrote disturbs me to be honest.    I'm a bit of a tree hugger. I eat everything though. Sorry Bud, I don't think you should have made her change the topic for her speech. She's obviously passionate about it. If a kid is happy, sociable, motivated, that's all that really counts.  I hope I'm still welcome in your boat  Lew, I seem to agree with stuff you say, wanna go fishing some time?"
901323,Salmonidstalker,2015-03-03 23:22:00,265,"You can't be upset that she has a mind and thinks for herself.  To me, this is something that I would nurture in a daughter.  i dont know why you would be upset, as I am an angler and hunter just as yourself and would not care whether my daughter had a different opinion on this subject.  for example, I am an athiest; if my kids decide on their own to believe in a religion, so be it."

I do understand well perhaps I don`t that kids nowadays seem to have some sort of control over their parents and do what ever they please....who is the parent?"

The younger daughter of one of the sisters did not eat meat and when questioned about it at the dinner table by her uncle with all family members present (it was a funeral supper) she said she didn't want to eat ""fear.""   She said all animals feel fear and that right before they are killed, that fear goes into their meat, so she did not want to eat that.   They made fun of her and she was not impressed.  I think you are going to have to let this one go because remembering back to when I was a young gal, when dad said I could not do something, it made me want to do it even more out of rebellion.  You can have your beliefs and she will have hers, for the rest of time  Good luck."

Someone has influenced this child, at 10 years of age, to go this way in her thoughts ( a new friend, one of their parents or a teacher as it's not coming from home).... but like everyone else (including myself) has stated Mike has got to let it play out (while he hide's in the corner)."

As you've acknowledged she is many of the things you want in a daughter and the fact that she's willing to stand up to you also speaks volumes.  Have you listened to the speech? Does she make valid points? Is she only making the emotional argument? I seem to remember that for our speeches we needed to at least mention the ""other side"" to our argument. Maybe you could have her discuss the fact that she and her family have been part of the food-web and will continue to be and maybe even the friction it has caused.  Some times when we the harder we push the harder they push back.  Good luck, and take notes because I'm sure I'm on the same track but just a few years behind you."
901347,Rod Caster,2015-03-04 00:00:00,5784,"She's obviously smart and understands/wants learning and research. Maybe you could use that to your advantage... teach her examples of human history and current societies that rely on meat and hunting and fishing and how that's helped us/them evolve/survive. Mothers with breastmilk production issues in the past could not always rely on wetnurses, they used cows milk or goats milk...Her views really only apply to a modern society where a vegetarian diet is actually available. Try relying on vegetables in the arctic, now or 200 years ago. She's missing some information; if she really desires to give this speech, she may need more information so that it's not one-sided, geographically-unique or economically biased.  Then again, she's 10, and I don't have a 10 year old, so maybe I'm being too logical and critical of the topic for someone of that age."

901351,Canuck2fan,2015-03-04 00:10:00,1444," Why's that?   Well see that's the thing, she's still only 10.  Well not for nothing but I have worked with about 1000 teenragers over the years and I have to say only maybe 10 not 10% of them would even have a clue about how to cook one meal during the ages of 14 to 18. So if she has been planning, shopping for and cooking her meals for more than week. She is mature enough to form her own thoughts, and keep them. Just tell her you love her and respect her opinion and her right to have it, but don't agree with it. If that the extent of the rebellion count your blessings."

901356,crappieperchhunter,2015-03-04 00:15:00,2582,"My daughter was a pill for a few years. Like Joey suggested saying no just seemed to make her more determined to make her parents crazy   As a teen she started hanging with a guy who was gay. Good kid we had known him since he was little. We had no problem with it. I kinda liked it actually cause I knew he wouldn't be trying any ""funny stuff"" with her.  Well one day she came home late and I was sitting here at the computer. Said she had something to tell me. Said she thought she liked girls. I turned to look at her and I saw that confrontational look on her face.  My face was level with her waist and I just hugged her around the waist  with my face on her hip and told her I didn't understand but if she was happy I was happy and everything would work out.  I can honestly say our relationship got better from that day forward.  As for her gay guy friend. When he finally got up the nerve to tell his folks. Mom was fine. Dad was a whole other story.  The father being a stubborn jerk split the whole family apart. They eventually divorced and the son moved out west and fell off the face of the earth.  It scares me to think what might have happened in my own family if I had been a jerk about my daughters news.  Tread lightly Mike. If you raise them right everything will work out."
901360,Fisherman,2015-03-04 00:19:00,7201,"Well, I'm on the other side of the fence.  At 10, she may have a strong will however you are the parent.  I don't want to sound like I'm bad mouthing your wife, however I strongly believe you have to get her on your side.  Children of which your daughter still is, have a wicked capability of hedging one parent against the other and won't stop until they get the desired result.  My wife didn't have a disciplinary bone in her and the boys knew that.  Dad can I...No!  Then it was Mom can I until I nipped that in the bud.   It took a bit, but both turned out about as good as any proud parent could want.  I wish you more than luck, hope you have a thick hide."
901367,Moosebunk,2015-03-04 00:35:00,3970,"So which one of her new friends is a vegetarian... or which teacher has swayed her this way with propaganda?  By third sentence Mike I thought this exact thing too...   The oldest here nearing 16 wants to sway from meat (just red for now) as well, although she's a little too lazy to want to cook foods for herself to replace the meals we make.  So she eats ours but, a lot of the better well cooked meals we do get to sit and enjoy as a family at home, Brenda and I are pretty well reminded during those dinners by her that she ""doesn't like this or that.""  An example, last nights Sheppards Pie was ""disgusting, but I'm hungry enough to eat it.""  We say something like that to our parents when we were raised and my dad's easiest response might have been, ""you're cruising for a bruising.""  But like Raf has said, correcting/scolding/threatening her at the dinner table or otherwise, does nothing but make mealtime a worse experience in the end, or push her away.  Girls are delicate creatures and constantly bogglin' the mind, regular open and caring communication is about the best we can hope to provide.  Yet your daughter is 10 man!  Like you said it.  And she may be a brilliant little 10 (I have one of those too) but you are the boss (or one of) in the household and the more intelligent adult.  I hear what guys are saying and agree about letting her do her speech and make her choices but, that aside I think in this case you still need to intervene somehow with this situation.  The overall picture as you clearly feel, is both a little defiant and disrespectful unto you. And, if it's bothering you to this point, and she's still so young and having her choices granted already upsets your family balance, it's not gonna get easier when she's a teenager who feels more and more like she's entitled to take charge of EVERYTHING.  I to admire how strong willed you say she is, but that said, you at the very least, need to take her aside and have a very meaningful and thought-out talk with her about all of this.  Though... and another thought... even if your answer was still to be a flat out ""NO,"" that could be acceptable.  You probably understand already that the strongest willed people of this day and age, are actually those who can handle and accept hearing that word from time to time.  Where that ability begins for most, is in childhood.  So really, giving in to her or saying no is a personal choice here, neither is right or wrong, both will have positive outcomes one way or another, you must communicate with her lovingly and as effectively you can, your reasons, and remember that you are the adult, she is the child, you will have final say.  Good luck."
901369,leaf4,2015-03-04 00:39:00,2466,"Lol my dads response to someone not eating something or not finishing their plate was ""I'll call 1-800 el Salvador and get a kid over here who will appreciate the food we put on the table"""
901370,bigugli,2015-03-04 00:42:00,6138,"It's a tough spot to be in Mike. You want your children to be able to make their own decisions on life, but you want them to make those decision based on reasoned argument, not propaganda. Sadly children are easy to sway with emotional arguments. And someone has stuck their hand in there real good. It's a real tough one for you for a couple of different reasons. Your daughter is going to speak on the evils of hunting, and you write for the ""enemy"". You are being ""outed"" as it were, by your daughter. Any fight with your wife regarding your daughter's best interests is a forlorn hope. Even if you are right, you are damned for eternity for interfering. Been there done that. Better set up the camp bed out in the man cave or garage."
901382,Big Cliff,2015-03-04 01:05:00,6899,"First, you never stop being a parent, you are stuck with that for life. When do you impose your will? When it is apparent that what they are doing could cause harm to them or someone else.  I would allow her to give her speach on the condition that she is willing to make sure she has  all the facts. Sit down with her and explain how hunting controls populations so that populations don't exceed the available foodin a given area. Or how over populations can breed disease which could wipe out the entire population of a species and anything that relies on that particular animal for it's sustenance.  Explain how hunters today go out of their way to insure that game is killed quickly and humanily and that the money they do spend for licenses goes to enhansing the survival of many species.  Well, you know the drill, you might not change her mind but you can leave her with something to think about.  Most important just be proud that she is willing to take a stand for something she believes in.  Edited: ""missed the trophey hunting post LOL"""

The oldest hunts with me, the middle one fishes with me constantly and is just chomping at the bit until he is old enough to get his apprenticeship card to hunt, and the little one is to small to hoist rod or gun as yet, but I'm sure his brothers will lead him down the right path.  I don't envy you, I don't know what I'd do in that situation."
901281,solopaddler,2015-03-03 22:18:00,8605,"I need someone to agree with me, even if it's anonymous people over the net.  I love my daughter. For only 10 years old she's fearless, incredibly smart, and unbelievably strong willed.  Back in November she announced to us that she was no longer going to eat meat - although she didn't tell us why.  Not too surprisingly she's stuck with it and been true to her word. My only stipulation was she must have some source of protein in her diet and she's managed to do that. Every week she plans a menu for herself and either me or my wife takes her shopping and gets her what she needs. She also cooks all her own meals herself too. As I said I'm very proud.  Now yesterday she tells me she's entered a regional competition and will be doing a 5 minute speech in front of hundreds of people. Again I'm so proud of her. At her age there's no way I could've done that. Like I said she's fearless.  Here's the problem. Earlier today she tells me her speech is going to be about how hunting and killing animals is bad.  This goes against everything that I believe in and the very way she's been raised. I tried to explain why it wasn't a good idea and gave her my reasons, but she's ultra stubborn. A lot like me.  I finally snapped and put my foot down and told her she had to find another topic to talk about and she lost her mind.  Both her and my wife are currently ganging up on me right now and I'm wondering if I did the right thing.  What do you guys think? How would you handle the situation?  It sure is true that they don't give you a handbook when it comes to raising a child LOL!"
