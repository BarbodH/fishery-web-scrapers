A 16"" bass - not huge but hey we're on the board  :       A 24 "" Musky ... dont worry that she is upside down ... she never left the water and swam away strongly immediately....I didn't attempt to get a pic beside the tape measure to ensure no unnecessary stress ...    And last but definitely not least .... a 36 "" Pike ...    She was pretty badly beaten up .. I suspect it was a big Musky .. we saw a couple of GIANTS today ...     Anyhow .. there ya go .... oh and I saw meegs out there today..."

357111,camillj,2009-06-30 14:20:00,1988,"Thanks guys !    Thanks Cliff  and Bly.. looks like you two had a pretty good one yourselves at Lakair !   Because I can Dawg .. because I can     Hey Mo, its tough going because of all the weeds ... but you probably already know that if you ever got out there really early you'd see em boiling on the surface so you KNOW they are there even if some days you have to go a the whole day with nuthin to show for it but a tan  Yesterday we also had a couple of REALLY big follows ... and I think I saw an Orca break the surface ... its one of the wildest places I know (besides the upper Ottawa river) for big old fish ..."
357118,BillM,2009-06-30 14:34:00,17367,"I live so close, I need to get out to Waubaushene more often.  Although the last time we were out there, I ripped the skeg clean off the motor"
357181,NAW,2009-06-30 17:05:00,4022,"I'm going to try a little Canada Day fishing out of Waubaushene tomorrow morning.  Does anyone know of free public launches and parking in the area.  I currently launch from a trailer park on the north side, off duck bay rd.  But they charge me to use the launch.  A free one would be great.  Any tips on lures and depths would be helpfull too.  I have never fished their before, only duck hunted.  I'd love to catch a few eyes for Canada Day dinner.  Herd you can catch'em trolling/casting by the Wab. town dock.  Thanks,"
