You can read it or not, but if you do, you can sit and think. OK, I will fish with that guy, and that guy, I won't. It does reflect on the comunity as a whole. Shows wether we can discuss a topic other than fishing and offer opinions. Do we fight about differing opinions, or offer intelligently written opposing opinions. Sometimes we gotta talk about more than just fishing to get to know each other."

If you or I feel differently then that is our own personal problem. He has now passed on   to a   greater judge, let him sort it all out. Just remember the little psycho for his entertainment value to society."
356336,Lowe Rider,2009-06-28 11:25:00,79," I don't know about that, a guy I knew was accused by his 14yr old step-daughter. The only evidence was her word.  Went through all the police, court and laywer stuff. I had a hard time believing it but who knows? He had a good job in the government driving around an Ontario Minister, lost it. Basically his life was trashed and 6 months later she said he didn't do anything, she was just trying to get her mothers attention because mom was focused on him too much. Charges dropped. The problem is he has been painted with that brush and no amount of cleaning will get it off, some think he did something still and others don't. Last I heard he moved somewhere up north to escape all the finger pointing.  Sad for all involved.  As for Mikey, I think the hush money for the first kid was a big mistake. IF he didn't do anything it just opened the doors for others to come along and try and get their piece of the pie. I believe there are some out there that would stoop to that level and use their kids as a stepping stone to a better life which is almost as bad if not worse."
356541,John Bacon,2009-06-29 00:06:00,3277," The civil trials were done first because the parents were more concerned about striking it rich then they were about the wellfare of their children.  I don't know whether or not he ever abused those children.  However, I am pretty sure that the parents had the lawsuits planned out before the children ever visited Michael Jackson."

I agree no grown man should sleep with little kids that are not their own but we are not talking about a ""normal"" grown man, your talking about someone who thinks that he himself is still a kid, he thinks he is peter pan and helping the kids which to me means he is more in the ""psycosis"" category than a peddie. Do you really think that if the courts thought this to be true that they would take payoffs then put more children at risk with a peddie?? I mean come on thats crazy and if you think that is true then i would like to hear more of your anomalies possibly on 911 or what about lennon?? did the US actually brain wash chapman to kill a single man who possibly had more power than the president of the united states or maybe even more power than anyone in the world at that time??? I mean its all fine and dandy to have your own opinions but when ""your"" opinions is what the media and the man spilled to you dont call them your own cause really it isnt yours."

I've heard enough about all the accusations against Michael, but to continue these accusations even after all charges were dropped AND his passing. In my opinion, I don't think Michael did those things that he was accused of,I believe that he gave up his childhood when he was very young which is when he began singing in the jackson 5 and this is why he enjoyed the company of children because he loved them very much and just wanted to relive the childhood he wasn't graced with. Lets let the late great veteran live.  RIP Michael Jackson    - Vick"

356150,4thgen,2009-06-26 23:32:00,157,"Yes, he slept in the same bed as kids etc. etc. but I think he was just really messed up and liked kids/thought he was a kid. I really doubt that he was a full out pedo. I think that some of the parents found out about the admittedly weird stuff that was going down at Neverland and decided to cash in on it. I didn't particularly like Micheal Jackson, this is just the conclusion that I've drawn from the media reports.  OJ did do it -- there is no question.  Hell? I suppose this opens up a whole new can of worms (fitting analogy for this website), but when we die, that's it - there is nothing else. Before anyone jumps on that, I've stated my belief as fact just as was done earlier in this thread.  Can we get a bet going on how many times the lego joke gets played? I'm going to tentatively go with 3."

Bottom line, if he did the things he was accused of, shame shame....he doesnt deserve the stage he moonwalked on. But if he didnt, its a shame that that is what he will be remembered for. Catastrophy actually if he didnt do what was ""said"".  At this point it doesnt matter if he did it or not........most people have made up there mind by watching the television and what the media told them. Again, i dunno either way, which leaves me unable to judge. Any wackjob at anytime can accuse you of anything, if theres a motive.......(and there was def. a motive to do so $$$) and you could have to go thru the system someday.........whats scary, is all the public needs to see is that youve been accused........and your pretty much done,....the seed was planted. Sure this guy is a circus act, and im guilty of taken all the accusations in as well........i wouldnt leave my kid with him unattended for sure, but i'd feel like a real heel had i found out that none of it was true.
