356377,Terry,2009-06-28 16:18:00,14456,"well I have had a hard time trying to get Misfish out fishing this year but opening weekend for bass and he was ready to go we decided to go to a secret river that runs through Bradford they were calling for rain, but I was sure it would hold off....NOT  we both got some bass, but some how Brian caught bigger ones, but he lost a real big one too  I got bit off 3 times and lost a real big dogfish, I am glad I didn't have to try to remove the hooks from the ugly thing..and I didn't need brain taking a picture of that.... the weeds were so thick much of the river is unfishable and can only get nastier as the summer progresses  anyways the rain ran us off the river, still it was great to get out and even ok to drag Misfish out   next  ...Smallmouth on simcoe     "

356390,misfish,2009-06-28 16:38:00,29133,"Well Terry I got to say,it sure was worth it.Heading out with you is always fun and a pleasure. Fishing was a little tough, but if we hit every fish we had hit,it would of been a great 4 hours of fishing.  Did you say smallies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,not sure I want to leave the river.Flip.n is addict,n.  Til next time.       "
