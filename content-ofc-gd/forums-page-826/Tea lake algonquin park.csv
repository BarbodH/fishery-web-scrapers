356472,richyb,2009-06-28 20:30:00,774,The g/f and I are planning a camping trip and one of her friends told her that they camped in algonquin on tea lake and had a blast. The g/f has already called and got prices but havent booked anything yet because I want to have decent fishing for a couple days where ever we choose to camp.   SO what kinds of fish are in there and is the fishing any good?    thanks .

He notes Pike and specks in nearby waters, so I wouldn't be surprised if you picked out the odd one from there. You know lakers will be deep right, so load up on your three-way swivels and wablers if there's interest.  I have a depth map for this lake somewhere, but not on me unfortunately. Best of luck!  P.S. Could try your question over at the forums of www.algonquinadventures.com . Great community full of people who love all things Algonquin."
