Seems like only yesterday I was changing his diaper and shoving a bottle in his mouth to make him happy. Guess that bottle may now have to say Smirnoff on the label or come in a brown bottle to quiet him. Have a drink since you are now legal but be easy....take it from the old man, it's no fun falling asleep wrapped around a toilet bowl.  Happy birthday."
