Once again we caught our limit in waleye. Boy have I been eating good these last few weeks....lol  Also caught this huge sheephead, though I had hooked onto a Northern.  Anyone else from the North Bay area fish Nippissing alot?  "

356815,Rizzo,2009-06-29 17:37:00,4754,"Welcome Luc. As you have likely read, we were also at Nipissing last week. I caught a sheephead just like that one on a ""Nitro"" which is a 5 ounce glider musky bait about 8 inches long. Thought I'd hooked a musky until the ol sheephead showed its ugly mug! They do put up a good fight at least!"
356818,LucG,2009-06-29 17:45:00,779,They do put on a fight. I got mine on a off white crankbait.
