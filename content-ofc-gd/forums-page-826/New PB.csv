356841,bullybass,2009-06-29 19:01:00,144,"Thanks very much. We did not have a scale with us... on shore in the van... so we only got the length and it was 11.5 "" approximately... as you can see half his tail is missing... he is a scrapper and has narrowly escaped being eaten by pike likely... old codger!!! hahaha"
356852,moemoe,2009-06-29 19:26:00,352,Looks like a tasty bluegill to me.....
356859,Mr Twister,2009-06-29 19:46:00,71,It is in fact a hybrid BlueGill/Sunfish as I call them Sun Gill's and the Bioligist said it is common with high consentrations of the two; ) and do grow bigger then normal Gill's. Pauly
356931,Burning Babies,2009-06-29 22:16:00,150,"Yup, huge hybrid.  Wow.  As far as keying it out, the blue mottling on the face and orange spots on the lower flanks tell you that it's a pumpkinseed, but it lacks that red mark on the gill flap of a pure pumpkinseed.  The coloration on that upper flanks is pretty typical for a bluegill, which is what they usually hybridize with."
356608,bullybass,2009-06-29 02:36:00,144,So I went to the Perth area for our bass opener... 3 hour drive from Newcastle. We hammered the bass... nothing really over 3 pounds though and the pads weren't really up yet... but still between my bro-in-law and I we caught and lost about 100 bass... the norm for here... all largemouth... He caught a nice little pike and we got 2 beautiful take home walleye... his 5.4 lbs and mine 3 ish lbs... he was kicking my butt on all the usual... species race... amount... largest... first fish....  ... but I got fish of the day with this beauty... 12 inches plate size... largest bluegill either of us has ever seen caught... I know.. crazy... but wow... no weight on it but... it was chunky and feisty...     Great day was had... toothy bugger so I made him lip the fish and hold it beside my head!!! bullybass
356613,drwxr,2009-06-29 02:45:00,453,"mad looking bluegil, looks like pirahna."
356616,spinnerbaitking,2009-06-29 02:50:00,1622,Check this site out Richard  http://www.notjustfishing.com/Fishing/records.shtml
356620,JohnF,2009-06-29 03:03:00,3494, That was my first thought too.  JF
356622,BillM,2009-06-29 03:04:00,17367,I wonder if that's related to the weird looking bass in the other thread? lol
356625,pikehunter,2009-06-29 03:07:00,1659,WOW! Could use that in a discus throw. Helluva Bluegill!
356634,jediangler,2009-06-29 03:34:00,1923,Beauty bull bluegill man. That's a real slab. Congrats.
356644,Cudz,2009-06-29 04:03:00,2652,No expert here but I am pretty sure that is a sunfish.  I have been wrong before though.
356648,ciceri,2009-06-29 04:11:00,535," Not sure if you are joking around, but Bluegill is a type of sunfish."
356649,Cudz,2009-06-29 04:17:00,2652,Very closely related but not the same fish. The turquoise worm-like pattern under the jaw to the eye area is pretty much unique to the sunfish and not to the bluegill. check the pics first is bluegill 
356651,Cudz,2009-06-29 04:18:00,2652,And this is a sunfish 
356652,ciceri,2009-06-29 04:22:00,535,"Well, from looking at those pictures, I say Bluegill because of the fins."
356660,Cudz,2009-06-29 04:38:00,2652,really?  Take a look at the anal fin.
356673,bassmaster4,2009-06-29 05:15:00,801,im with cudz on this one but i believe that the fish is called a pumpkinseed?
356675,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-29 05:24:00,0,"bassmaster is in fact, the winner."
356689,Rich,2009-06-29 09:47:00,3927,It's a bluegill. And a beauty.
356694,Jer,2009-06-29 10:51:00,1426,...bluegill...pumpkinseed...  Both sunfish as far as I know.  That looks like a pumpkinseed...and a big one at that.
356701,Greencoachdog,2009-06-29 11:30:00,8163,That is a HUGE Pumpkinseed!!!... probably a Pumpkinseed/Redear hybrid.  That is a very old fish.  This gives some good examples of the different Sunfish and how to ID them.  http://www.tnfish.org/FishIdentificationID...ication_Key.htm
356737,bullybass,2009-06-29 14:04:00,144,I agree that it looks like a pumpkinseed after checking out all the info.... thanks guys. My bro said that he would have kept it and had it mounted for sure... but I don't think that I could do that and I am certain that my wife wouldn't have went along with that. If it indeed was a pumpkinseed then it was definitely a record according to that site for Ontario... since that record sits 1 lb and 10 inches... damn I should have taken better pictures... I guess I will have to go back and see if I can get some more slabs!!! Thanks for all the replies everyone...he was great to catch!!!  P.S. We always said that there was something weird about this little lake in the fact that the fish are so strong... no matter what the size... I guess there really must be some steroids in there...  bullybass
356739,Greencoachdog,2009-06-29 14:09:00,8163, You should have some really really good fishing Karma coming to you for putting that magnificent specimen back!!!  I thank you on behalf of all the fishermen that care about our resources!!!
356784,crappieperchhunter,2009-06-29 16:11:00,2582,"That looks like a MONSTER pumpkinseed to me. Catch lots in the early fall on Simcoe where I chase crappies. I have got them up to 10 inches.... never got one even close to that size...what a hog.  A PB that will be very difficult to beat, Congrats."
356790,Governator,2009-06-29 16:36:00,879,Looks like a Sunfish mated with a Dolphinfish lol.  That's gigantic.
356792,NAW,2009-06-29 16:37:00,4022,"look at the forehead on that thing eh.  Nice fish.,"
356798,Leecher,2009-06-29 16:59:00,7832,Congratulations bullybass on your PB That is an enormous pumpkinseed Leechman
356838,wallyboss,2009-06-29 18:46:00,1095,"Gorgeous fish,  what was the measurement?????If it was 11"" it was a record. Wouldn't that be fun on an ultralight ice rod with 1lbs test line!!!!!"
