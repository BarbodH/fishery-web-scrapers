There were lots of people who were missed but those of us who made it up made the best of it   I arrived Friday around noon, got set up and began the visits, no fishing that day   Sat. Lew was good enough to share a cup of coffee with me while we waited for everyone else to wake up and Loonietoon was kind enough to allow me in his boat to net his fish, and that is what I did.  For the most part, I'll let the pictures speak for me...  Home away from Home       Kevin     Tybo     Strategy session       ChrisK checking out the new Kayak   ChrisK's dog Sam, don't think I ever saw him dry     TJ Shooting a Pike   Loonietoons fish that I was allowed to net   Someone is getting hungry   This one is for Joe and Art   Irishfield   TJ and family returning   Prize table   Rizzo   ccmt   This is the fish that TJ cooked up, I ate more fish St. night than I have in the last year or more   Man was it tastey and those who cleaned them did a fantastik job!!!!   That's it for me, after the fish was cooked the camera got put away   Thanks to all who donated all the great prizes, and again it was great to see some old friends and meet some new ones.  With luck I'll head up there again in late summer early fall for a couple of days.  Maureen"

357061,motv8tr,2009-06-30 11:05:00,2587,"Cozy is good, there was no room for the mosquitos in there with me, I guess they found it too cramped  Maureen"
