356656,Devious,2009-06-29 04:33:00,49,Got out out fishing with my buddy Jeff on saturday for the bass opener.  We were up at 4:30am and extremely excited to get on the water as im sure everyone else was on saturday.  There was a bass derby on the same lake we planned to fish so we split a ticket and took our chances with the big fish.  We got on the water around 6am and went straight to a weed bed we knew held some dandys.  No more then 20 mins into the day Jeff sets into this big boy and shortly after was yelling at me I HAVE THE WINNER ON MY LINE!! haha....I quickly reeled in and grabbed the net patiently waiting beside jeff who was now fighting his PB largemouth...it jumped once and took one very hard/long run at the boat where for a split second we thought it might get off but we manged to get it in.   6lbs 4oz   What a pig.....   My big fish of the day...just over 3.5lbs haha might as well be a baby....   Our buddy Jay actually called Jeff out on facebook saying he was going to win the derby and not jeff.....well jeff had other things in mind apparantly hahaha.  Overall it was a great day day on the water...beautiful weather and tons of fish...I don't think I could of complained about anything and getting to witness a catch like that is amazing....... hope everyone had a great opening weekend.
