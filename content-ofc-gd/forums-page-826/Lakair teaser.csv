TJ and his wife Monique (forgive me if I've spelled it wrong) put a lot of effort into this and I don't think they get as much thanks as they deserve.  Had a chance to meet some of the usual suspects and some ""new"" members in person for the first time. I also missed some who were there last year. No, not you Dawg.  But the others know who they are. Hope you make it back next year.  A special thanks to Spiel who made a spot in his boat for me during the derby, very generous, even if I did have to share space with your's and ChrisK's dogs. I couldn't have asked for better boat mates. The two of them didn't piddle once, too bad I can't say the same for Spiel and ChrisK.  Some shots from last year:     bly and ccmt coming into the docks   That will have to due for now."
