357002,chilli,2009-06-30 01:23:00,199,"The OFAH is running a survey to collect angler attitudes and knowledge about sturgeon and sturgeon fishing in Ontario.  Responses are being solicited from sturgeon anglers and non-sturgeon anglers alike.  To access the survey please go to www.ofah.org/sturgeon  The survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete.  Please forward to any other angling friends you have in your address book or post on message boards that you frequent (already on a couple).  I am hoping to solicit responses from as far reaching in Ontario and those outside Ontario that fish in Ontario.  A summary of the survey can be found in the magazine for those without internet access or I can provide a pdf copy which can be printed and mailed in also.  If you have any questions or comments beyond what is captured in the survey feel free to direct them to me at the contact information below.  ps. - for those that have were part of the 'test' audience -- this link is now for the 'real' survey.  Please complete this version as data from the previous survey will not be utilized.
