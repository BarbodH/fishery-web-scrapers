356551,danc,2009-06-29 00:31:00,4677,Lots of folks seem to enjoy catching Pike. They're a dime a dozen where I fish. I'd rather not catch one than catch one. But I wouldn't start an entire thread stating just that. To each his own I guess..

356559,Jonny,2009-06-29 00:49:00,1380," I've spent more time in my life fishing for pickerel than any other kind of fish. So yeah, they're awesome.  HOWEVER, I love catching bass, pike, specks, lakers, salmon (chinooks and pinks), rainbows, splake, cutthroat, perch, saugers, catfish, lake herring, even drum too (I've only ever caught ONE crappie and ONE muskie!). They're all worthy fish, and all good eating, except that I'd put lakers down at the bottom of the list for that.  I just don't get the idea of dissing bass. Aren't we all hoping for ""dumb"" fish to keep the action hot and heavy? And aren't all fish ""dumb"" when the conditions and/or the presentation are right? And why pass up a fish that can give a spectacular fight and tastes good on your plate?  Seems like a total win to me. But then again, I don't subscribe to any ""best"" fish, or any ""best"" way of fishing."

356745,blaque,2009-06-29 14:17:00,2419,"My favorite fish to fish for is anything that swims.  I can tell you that ive had days out on erie, where you just couldnt go wrong with the smallmouth...............and yes, you can see everyone from ""experts"" to those you just know are novice fisherman bringing smallies to the boat........but i can also tell you ive been out there when you see these same ""experts"" and novice weekenders not getting a sniff, no matter what their experience or skill level. They shut off, and hunker down and have behavioral migration patterns that force you to fine them, etc etc....just like any other fish does.  Dont let the fact that there may be a dense population of them where YOU fish and you may have gotten into them every time out fool you.  Ive watched many a Bass ignore me.....now, are their more difficult fish out there to target, i dunno....maybe. I know id rather fish for walleye, but that doesnt mean its harder.  One mans trash is another mans treasure. I seem to have the most fun while fishing for species i dont get a chance to fish for enough."

The only reason most people fish them so much, is its easy. I like a little challenge. Bass are what I call a day saver. When the fishings tough, and you can't catch any fish with teeth..........there are always bass willing to bite.   They'll hit anything, and they're everywhere you go. Easy, sleazy.........dirtly ole bass.  S."

I lik'em easy and sleazy anyways... just not dirty  I've gone from calling a 5 day bass day great to about 20-30 and hope to keep improving.

356349,dmac,2009-06-28 13:56:00,3,"Sorry guys but anyone can catch a bass. They are just like sunfish only bigger. As for the stalking and finding them part thats not all that hard. Find a patch of weed or a mat and start pitchin. You'l probably get one 7 outa ten times. I dont see what the big hype for them is. They are an easy fish to catch. So i guess if you want an easy catch, fish for bass."
356354,aniceguy,2009-06-28 14:49:00,1094,"good thread, hope it doesnt go down hill.  I too thought anyone can catch a bass and your right anyone can, but once I actually fished a few tournaments against other bass guys my thinking changed really fast on it.  I felt prior to it I could rate my self as a 5-6 out of 10 as a bass guy find some weeds and off you go, but I quickly realized  after the first event I was maybe a 1 or 2 on a great day, when it came to finding bigger bass not bass but big bass on a pattern aimed at catching them  Flippin a jig what color trailer, pitchin creature baits ( that list in about a foot long), at least 6 worm techniques, crankbaits jerk baits what depth what color what style, spinner baits what blade what color what trailer, tubes belly weight or bullet a 3 or a 5 in size, dropshotting top water sammy's poppers, frogs buzzbaits the list and combination is endless and boundless both with baits and rods.....I think i have close to 20 rods now and am going to pick up another one after realizing something about deep diving cranks  Your right anyone can catch a bass but not just anyone can catch a lot of really big bass in fact a very select few can catch bass at a rate that wins events.  If all one wants is to go to a lake catch a few bass and relax then yup anyone including our kids can catch a bass on a rig as simple as a worm and bobber, but I cant think of another fish that has as many techniques, patterns and gear aimed at catching really big bass........ I watched everyone yesterday work 6 feet of water over weeds, while I cranked into 25 fow for largiesin a main lake creek channel.....go figure"
356356,ch312,2009-06-28 14:52:00,1590, rockbass are the hardest fighters out there...imagine the fight from a 5lb rocky
356374,Twocoda,2009-06-28 16:09:00,4130,Bass serve the purpose of entry level to this addiction we call fishing....some never let it go ( because of fond memories)...but for me ...i evolved to the harder core portions of the addiction

356393,CLofchik,2009-06-28 16:44:00,854," LMAO, so it's a penis envy, ""mine is longer than yours!"" thing with bass fisherman?   Ah okay, I get it now.  Obviously overcompensating for some ""inadequacies"".  Is this what drives bass fishing to bigger, longer, stiffer, faster boats, motors and rods?  I had no idea of the deep seated insecurities of serious bass fisherman, apparently I touched a nerve there.   I never said I HATED bass, just that I can't figure out what there is that makes people go hardcore after them.  Sure they're simple fun, and I'll go tangle with smallies and have a great weekend doing it.  But I don't lay awake the night before a big trip dreaming about bass.  Heck wading a river stalking carp like bonefish on the flats is more heart pumping than popping a small Torpedo after 1 1/2lb fish.   Ever try weight forward spinners?  There's this thing called a SpinRite, pretty unique lure.  Like an Erie Dearie with a marabou dressed rear hook.  Killer on suspended or deep rock holding bass.  Hard to find though, but I agree with you on deep bass.   Heh yeah that was me, nice turnout for the tourney.  Sure it's all good, but some are better than others, oh and I'll take the 4ft ski over the 6"" brookie"

356490,Jonny,2009-06-28 21:42:00,1380," So what makes the pickerel so much better?  Less aggressive, anemic fight compared to a smallmouth, tastes just about the same.  How can being picky make a sport fish a better sport fish?  I dunno, maybe it's that flash of white tail-tip while you're hauling them up that makes them so exciting. But for pure fighting fun, give me a bass or a pike any day."
356491,archie_james_c,2009-06-28 21:46:00,618,  The fact that they're chock full of awesomeness....

356498,Whitespinnerbait,2009-06-28 22:11:00,2038,  Yep...  Looks like a Green Trout to me

356531,trapshooter,2009-06-28 23:37:00,1234,I don't care about opener because bass is OPEN ALL YEAR in NW Ontario!!
356535,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-28 23:43:00,0,or would you even if there was a Green carp season. About as exciting as raibow Trout opener.
356536,Rich,2009-06-28 23:51:00,3927,It certainly has lost a lot of excitement for me... but I'll never miss it!
356233,CLofchik,2009-06-27 19:18:00,854,"Bass season opened today........yawn.  I never really got into bass fishing, they're a fun little fish to play with on summer days.  But really, how do you get excited over 3lb. fish you just winch over side?  I'll spend a few weekends every year camping on back lakes for some bruiser mule smallies and have a fun time, but I'll spend just as much time kicking back in a camp chair soaking up the sun relaxing than bothering to fish.  I atleast understand why people fish for crappie, perch & pickeral, they taste good!  But eating bass, yeck!  Today I'm going to walk my dogs down to check out a carp derby, then probably put in a few hours in the evening going after sheepshead, errr whistletrout.  I'll catch more fish in those two hours than most bass guys, and they'll be double the size and fight twice as hard as any largemouth.  And taste a heckuva lot better.  What am I missing that makes guys go out and spend crazy amounts of money pimping out rigs with huge motors to go chase these little fish, what's so special about bass?"
356235,anders,2009-06-27 19:50:00,1168,"I hear ya...give me something i can catch and eat that tastes great, like walleye, or give me Salmon...now there's a fight...bass..isnt that an instrument?"

356243,laszlo,2009-06-27 20:31:00,487,I had a blast this morning fishing and plan to have some more this evening. I can think of a few reasons why bass fishing is so much fun.  1) Place casting. Makes it feel more like a sport with specific physical movement.  2) Surface strikes. Nothing beats seeing the fish take your bait.  3) Can you say Smallmouth Bass. What a great fighting fish. How can you not enjoy the fight of a 3 to 6lb Smallie???  4) Finding Structure.  5) Catch and Release.  Plus...you don't have to spend a lot of money to fish for bass. My gear is middle of the road and I only use 1 medium to heavy rod with a sensitive tip and I'm all set.
356244,charlied,2009-06-27 20:35:00,584,"Well I bass fish from a Kayak with an ultra light rod and 4 pound test.  Now a 3-4 pound smallie giving me all its got on my set-up can be pretty fun!!  I don't eat fish so who cares if bass taste terrible to some.  If you feel bass are not a fight then change your set-up to an ultra light...its a different story.  Also a nice smallie will put up a fight better than a crappy, perch and walleye combined!!  So I am not so sure why you are so negative towards bass opener!  I am a Steelheader and I still like to fish for bass!  Maybe I just love the sport!"
356249,Jonny,2009-06-27 20:54:00,1380,"Any fisherman who disses bass has gotta be nuts.  Great fight, surface action, and (though I can't hardly believe it, a news flash for some) bass is really good eating. Every bit as good as pickerel and pike, and to me a damn sight better than any trout. Pan-fried bass fillets are excellent fare.  Fishing crappie is like fishing perch - it can be fun, and they taste good - but they're little fish. They're a good filler when nothing else is available or nothing else is biting."
356251,Jonny,2009-06-27 20:59:00,1380," Yep. For fight, nothing is as ""boring"" as pickerel. Struggle to get straight to the bottom, that's about it. No that I don't enjoy catching pickerel, but if the fight is the thing being talked about, pound-for-pound a bass can way outfight a pickerel any day."
356252,misfish,2009-06-27 21:09:00,29133,"Im looking forward to the flip,sudden impact and the fight is on.  Then the ""I can believe I missed that one"".    17hrs and counting."
356256,bigugli,2009-06-27 21:42:00,6138,"To me it's just a part of the variety that keeps things different and interesting. Just like every other species I target. Different time, species and tactics. The lighter the tackle the better.  Oh, and 1lb. bass are a perfect side to a big plate of bacon, eggs and homefries for brekkie  Bass opener also marked the real beginning of summer when I was a kid."
356260,ColdH20guy,2009-06-27 21:54:00,312, who pissed in your cornflakes? geez..... with comments like that you should keep them to yourself...we dont care that you would rather sit on your dock; we wouldnt! go check out your carp derby...and how can you say bass doesnt taste good...you're just not right..go back to your dock and soak up some more sun..
356266,JohnF,2009-06-27 22:22:00,3494," As someone else said, it's a man thing, going mano a mano against a 2 or 3 pound carnivore in his own natural element (I wade mostly), anticipating his every move (they're cunning little fellers for something with a brain the size of a pea), stalking him at risk of life and limb (we have a lot of slippery rocks where we fish) and finally being able to hold him high for the victory pic to prove to other manly men that I can actually best a creature of the wild 1/100 of my size. What's not to like?  Besides, It's either carp, suckers or bass in my part of the province unless I wanna drive an hour or more (usually more) and I wouldn't trade one hour of quality creek time for a whole day of trolling for the denizens of the deep - been there, done that - seriously boring. Sure, it's fun when you finally hook into a big fella but the hang time sux. I'll take slipping and sliding over slippery rocks for hours any day over hours doing nothing in a boat - waiting.  JF"

356282,blarg,2009-06-28 00:20:00,289,"I was out with my 12 yr old this morning, we caught about 12 smallies and had a great time, fish were hitting hard and fast, even caught a walleye in amognst the bass, they weren't big fish, maybe 2-21/2 lbs at most but so strong for thier size.  And..we were fiishing, we weren't trolling or drifting, we were casting for fish, we had to find them and figure out what they wanted to hit, it was a hell of alot more fun than any of the walleye fishing we did in the spring.  Personally i don't undersand how anyone could be bored by that, not if you like to fish, I would say that liking to eat fish enough to want to go out and catch them doesn't mean you like to fish, it just means you're hungry.  You see it here in the spring when every tom dick and harry is on the lake trying to catch dinner, they don't even look like they want to be out there and alot of them are the most inconsiderate (did you really need to park your boat 50 feet in front of mine on the drift path my boat was on..the other 5 miles of shoreline wasn't enough for you..sigh) and unsportsman like people to have to share the lake with.  I like a walley as much as the next guy but the fishing has tapered off here and in at least one way thats good, the lake is alot quieter and there are fewer idiots putting the cover on thier boats while still on the ramp!  For simple fun it's hard to beat a smallmouth, if you don't feel that way you definitely don't experience fishing the same way i do, but to each his own."
