After landing a nice little smallmouth on my first cast with the hulapopper i figured we were going to have one of those days. The visibility in this lake gets real crappy in a hurry once the water warms up, but we could  still see a good 5-6ft down which was a good sign. I think we honestly landed 40+ bass and atleast a dozen walleye between the two of us. Got this guy on the green tube i was pitching near a fallen tree for a bass..lol  Got this guy on our way back to the launch.  Another confused walleye biting my favourite bass tube...  Big fish of the day! Although my dad could give a pretty good argument  And here he is with a walleye. Though i took a pic of him with a bass, but guess not..lol   All and all a wicked day except for my light action mitchell going overboard with a bass attached on the other end... but we won't talk about that...  Cheers guys and happy fishing!"
