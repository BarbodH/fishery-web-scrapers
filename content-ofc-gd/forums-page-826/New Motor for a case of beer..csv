356757,Woodsman,2009-06-29 14:48:00,1286,"Last week I meet a guy who was scraping his boat & motor. Fiberglass boat was destroyed by raccoons. He said the motor ran good but the tilt/trim didn't work. He was told it was a $2,000 repair. Bottom line if I removed it I could have it for a case of beer. I figure I can run it without the tilt/trim if it cannot be fixed cheaper. It's a 1985 Merc. 90 hp.      I should have a repair manual by Thurs/Fri. than I'll start working on it. It does turn over good and is exceptionally clean inside & out. Appears to be well maintained. If it's not worth fixing up at least I'll have many good parts for sale. I also bought a unused rebuilt prop from him for $50 which was in a sealed bag with a receipt for just over $100.  Rick"
