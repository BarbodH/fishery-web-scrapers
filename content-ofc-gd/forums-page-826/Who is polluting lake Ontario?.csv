355411,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-25 00:30:00,947,   Well sinker did make a post about who to contact and stuff.  Just thought i throw in a lil humor  Maybe you can start up a group like this  
355413,fish_finder,2009-06-25 00:33:00,370,"yeah, and I'm sure that my tricking of fish into impaling themselves on hooks would go great with that.....  Seriously, your quarry lives in that water, and so does the water of millions.......  Nothing at all to joke about, but thats just my opinion......"
355448,Fishnwire,2009-06-25 01:48:00,983,Looks like rust.  But there sure is a lot of it.  Does not look like pollen.
355450,Jet,2009-06-25 01:56:00,364,"You could send those pictures to CP24, I'm sure that would make for an interesting story when they bring their cameras down there."
355469,Radnine,2009-06-25 02:49:00,1538,Classic! Jim
355470,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-25 02:52:00,947,  I LOVED THAT STUFF WHEN I WAS A KID
355481,GBW,2009-06-25 03:23:00,8460,"I drank the ""Orange drink"" right up till they got rid of it a month or so ago.  BTW, it was meant to lighten the thread as others spoke of what to do.  Cheers.  I wish they still had it!  Better then gatoraid for a hangover!"
356517,BUSTER,2009-06-28 23:05:00,1336,So what was it??????  Anyone know the truth?  Inquiring minds want to know!
356525,laszlo,2009-06-28 23:27:00,487,"I use to live right around the corner from there off parkside drive. The Humber River is the nastiest water. Just north of the city there have been over 1,500 chemical and oil spills into the river over the last 9 years by industrial & commercial companies.  I still live along the Humber but in North Etobicoke close to Humber College and have seen and reported paint cans, garbage bins and grocery carts being dumped in the river.  It's really sad. Tried fishing the river 10 times now with only catching chub. Seen a couple carp and sucker and most times they are floating and half dead.  Oddly enough just north of the industrial companies polluting it's waters is a healthy trout fishery."
356696,outllaw,2009-06-29 11:00:00,1232,instead of pink salmon. they wil soon be orange.
356928,johnnyb,2009-06-29 22:10:00,3413,Has anyone called yet?  Is it still going in?  Henry where in the heck did you find that treehugger video?
355006,dsn,2009-06-24 02:01:00,1018,I took a walk over a bridge and saw this slight orange tinge in the water out towards lake Ontario. As the waves moves you can make it out ever so slightly. So I followed the trail. From the left of the this pic to the right was a orange tinge to it.     You can see it a bit to the top right corner of the pic. Just under the over hanging tree.   What a mess ! Wonder if its paint?   It was coming out pretty quick. Here's a top view.     Closer look from the top.    Poor us this is supposed to be our drinking water.     Oh by the way here's a carp from 2 days ago. Which I prefer to report about rather water pollution. Check out the hump on top of its head.. it must have banged it against something during the fight.   DSN
355022,Pigeontroller,2009-06-24 02:25:00,2793,Please report this to the Ministry of the Enviroment! there is a hotline to report poluters!
355040,Sinker,2009-06-24 03:17:00,8692,"Yep, I'd be calling the Spills Action Center on that one..........I hope you already did!!!!  If not, call them now..........tell me where that was and I'll call! That's nasty lookin stuff!!  To report an environmental emergency â€“ a spill to air, land or water, or a drinking water incident:  Call the Spills Action Centre.  Toll Free: 1-800-268-6060 Tel: (416) 325-3000   Sinker"
355041,Joey,2009-06-24 03:23:00,9122,"That's horrid.  I hope they can find the source, and fine them big time.  Joey"
355042,BillM,2009-06-24 03:24:00,17367,Hopefully it's nothing more then a water/clay mix.
355044,GBW,2009-06-24 03:26:00,8460,"So that's what McD's did to the ""orange"" drink when they got rid of it..."
355046,SBCregal,2009-06-24 03:31:00,688,it looks almost like rust.
355047,Paully,2009-06-24 03:38:00,712,rusty sprinkler water?
355048,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-24 03:58:00,10439,Agent Orange? ? ?
355050,timmeh,2009-06-24 04:09:00,609,Make sure you do call the spills action center and let them know exactly where you were. Also make sure to let them know that you have picture proof of what happened. Hopefully there is a good explanation but just in case make the call.
355051,yakpiker,2009-06-24 04:10:00,160,That looks like the Palace Place condo at the mouth of the Humber River.  I think the only source of the outflow could be from the condo building...there's nothing else at the end of that road on the west side of the river.  Wonder what the heck they are spilling into the lake?  Sure looks unnatural.
355052,purekgw,2009-06-24 04:13:00,585,thats alot of kraft dinner
355073,Paully,2009-06-24 10:02:00,712, if this is the case then its prolly rusty sprinkler water... I once worked a sprinkler tech and that looks just like the water that came out of the pipes..
355077,cram,2009-06-24 10:28:00,1733,"Report it. Now. if you haven't already.   You'll be surprised how much they can learn from what might be left in that pipe....may be able to track down the culprit, if there is one."
355079,Billy Bob,2009-06-24 10:55:00,5865,Found out it's not polluting if you have a permit...........at least that's what they do here in NYS.......and you can sell your polluting credits to another company if by chance you can't use them all up by your company......GO FIGURE....
355095,BITEME,2009-06-24 11:51:00,1968,Its Pollen from Trees and plants....Seriously!!!
355099,Greencoachdog,2009-06-24 12:00:00,8163,"Yeah, that's nasty!  Even if it is rusty sprinkler water, it shouldn't be dumped into the storm sewer."
355130,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-24 13:25:00,947,Closer look from the top.       I KNOW WHAT IT IS                       
355136,nofrills,2009-06-24 13:34:00,89,"Not that I'm an expert or anything, but it could also be a ""dye"" thats added to sewer lines to help trace them. I've seen it done a couple times in the Don I also suppose it could be something to control mosquitos, but I don't remember that being orange."
355141,Headhunter,2009-06-24 13:42:00,5703,"I think it is as simple as the local Swiss Chalet cleaning out their ""Chalet sauce"" tank. Cormorants like a little side sauce to , ya know! HH"
355243,EC1,2009-06-24 18:27:00,930, The Storm Sewer water doesn't get treated and gets dumped right back into lake ontario as far as I know in Toronto
355244,BITEME,2009-06-24 18:31:00,1968,POLLEN
355302,fishfarmer2,2009-06-24 20:28:00,76,*Hi* Dsn I cant believe these pictures very sad to see this . I hope some on  here will  look in the matter this is bad like you say its our (Drinking_Water) thanks
355303,Sinker,2009-06-24 20:29:00,8692,"That is definitly not pollen.  It could very well be anything, but,  for sure ain't pollen.  S."
355408,fish_finder,2009-06-25 00:21:00,370,"    For a group of apparent outdoors people......I sure am glad to see how seriously you take something like this.  But yeah, a great percentage of you probably do drink that, so I guess you know what you are drinking now......or at least what colour it starts out as."
