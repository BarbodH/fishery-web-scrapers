356523,Rich,2009-06-28 23:26:00,3927,Offered to guide Sleded at some of my local trout haunts I've been bragging about since I moved. And like a true brown lover he was here in a flash. Fished from 3:30 - 7pm and what a difference in weather in that amount of time. At first the sun was beating down and I stripped down... nailed a carp right off the bat about 5 lbs which was quite the fight. Video to come. Next I got a surprise as I have never seen one here yet.. a largemouth! This has me a little excited! Always discovering new things in my backyard.    After very little action here we moved on to a dam I know a little better... this is where it got cloudy. After we ran out of worms catching gobies Sleded put a 3 inch jerkbait on and just put on a clinic from that point on. I think there were 7 trout caught (only one was mine) and Sleded took a couple home. All browns.          Thanks for coming out Sleded glad I could show you a few spots.
