356835,Chugger,2009-06-29 18:38:00,109,"HAHAHA, yeah that's a pretty good tip I'd say."
356940,johnnyb,2009-06-29 22:27:00,3413,I don't hear of too many people catching walleye on Skeleton...but you can always try 3-Mile just down the road if you've got wheels under your boat...
357081,Chugger,2009-06-30 12:43:00,109,"You know, I've been fishing there for the past 5 years, and I've never seen one.  Now a few guys I talk to catch them all the time even without fishing for them.  Every year in the derby some one pulls out a beauty....so I konw they're there, i just need to find'em."
