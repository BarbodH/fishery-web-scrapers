356832,Roy,2009-06-29 18:36:00,13728,I had one for several years. It was fiberglass.....I could have kept it but I didn`t have the room. It was a great boat!
356836,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-29 18:38:00,1022,"Oh ya? This one is aluminum, all welded hull."
356845,DRIFTER_016,2009-06-29 19:12:00,10439,"I have a Fisher SV-18GT Aluminum that I bought new in 1991 and am still running it. It is a very well built boat. I just wish mine was riveted like yours. I don't know about yours but mine has aluminum stringers and a carpeted aluminum deck. One more thing, it will handle some nasty   weather too. I have had it out on Lake Erie in some nasty weather and had it out on Lake ""O"" when I should have been on shore (the marine cops came out to see if I was OK because of the nasty rollers complete with white foam on the crests blowing out of the East.  Here's a few pics of her, including the helm upgrade I did last year.          "
356849,Marty,2009-06-29 19:21:00,873,"Here's mine, a SV GT 165.  Even though I need a bigger boat, this one is perfect for fishing.  I bring it to Canada every year.   It's an '86 and it is one solid boat.   Great in rough water and great to fish in.     I have a 70 hp and a 9.9 kicker.   "
356866,dagoat_1,2009-06-29 20:03:00,72,I have a 1998 17.5 SC and wouldnt part with it.  All welded hull.  probably same as your talking about.  I have a 90hp on it right and the thing seems perfect even though max is 115hp rating.  If you can get a good deal on it i say go for it.
357076,Fish4Eyes,2009-06-30 12:14:00,1022,"OK, thanks for the tips!"
357086,bassassin,2009-06-30 12:59:00,152,"The best boat i have ever had!! 17.5' x 8'2"" beam. unbelievably stable but super versatile, I have a 06 Fisher Hawk 170 Sport with walkthrough windshield and a 90hp Opti she pushes 37-40mph more than enough for us!!!!"
