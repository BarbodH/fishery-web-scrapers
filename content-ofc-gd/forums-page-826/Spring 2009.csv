Most fish came off of jerkbaits of various sizes and colours. Some fish fell victom to spoons and spinnerbaits.We even experimented with the new swimbaits that have hit the scene. Enjoy the pics. Heres the first fish of the season......Was this a sign of things to come ?  We started the season off nice and close to home.  A couple of respectable T-dot fish.......    Bumped into this old boot with a jerkbait.Pretty cool to say the least.  Then it was up north to a few new lakes that we always wanted to try, as well as a few old favorites.        These two pics are my favorite.........Solopadler style!     A couple more......    The same fish.....  Well thats my story and Im stickin to it. I hope you all have a great bass season. Now I can concentrate on this.....  and this..... "
