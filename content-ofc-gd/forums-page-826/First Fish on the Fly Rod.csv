I got a fly rod +reel a while ago for my B-day and finally got to fish with it. (I've been practicing in the backyard)  I tried for a bit with a dry fly but i had no success so i pulled out a Hare's Ear nymph and caught around 6 of these guys.      I didn't bother taking anymore pics since they were basically all the same size.  I also had one fish try to eat my indicator!  I only was out for a few hours but i had a great time.  Tibbs"

356454,kennyman,2009-06-28 19:20:00,737,"Congratulations. Nice! Six fish on your first attempt!! My first day fly fishing (last year) I caught one creek chub LOL, and I was happy.  If I had caught six trout I'd have been in heaven. Nice going!"
