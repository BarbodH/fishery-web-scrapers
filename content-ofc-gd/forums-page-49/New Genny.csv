1041920,captpierre,2019-03-23 22:17:00,2521,I enquired of you guys about a genny in case of power failure. Found this highly rated Honda inverter/generator. They are on sale for $1999. That’s $600 off till March 31. All dealers Now let’s hope I don’t need her ??? https://powerequipment.honda.ca/generators/ultra-quiet-3000i-es
1041923,lew,2019-03-23 22:29:00,12766,But now when the power goes out at your cottage...and it will...your gonna be all set.
1041925,DRIFTER_016,2019-03-23 22:50:00,10439,Nice generator. I pan on getting this one to run my place in the winter. https://powerequipment.honda.ca/generators/ultra-quiet-7000i-es
1041928,Fisherman,2019-03-23 23:22:00,7201,That's a decent price.  I've got an older version of that one and really quiet and cheap to run.
