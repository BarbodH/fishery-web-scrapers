1041792,ketchenany,2019-03-20 22:33:00,3229,And this happens! Kids are so taken when this happens.   
1041793,lew,2019-03-20 22:50:00,12766,The calendar might say spring has arrived but my front lawn sure doesn't look like it LOL 
1041794,Fisherman,2019-03-20 23:02:00,7201,"Another week or so Lew, it's coming."
1041795,lew,2019-03-20 23:13:00,12766,"Yeah, I was just joking, I actually worked outside today in shorts & T-shirt"
1041796,misfish,2019-03-20 23:33:00,29133,You can come ice fishing for perch in that this weekend Lew.
1041807,lew,2019-03-21 07:59:00,12766,After all these years you're still trying eh Bud ? hahaha
1041810,Acountdeleted,2019-03-21 11:45:00,2562,If it didn't hurt to walk more then 50 feet I'd be super tempted to test this ice on Cooch this saturday.
1041814,KawarthaAngler,2019-03-21 12:23:00,273,"On that warm day I already put my boat in the water, but then we had another short cold spell.  But not long now!   "
1041817,jimmer,2019-03-21 13:46:00,2730,What a shame. I wouldn't mind a bass boat like that. It's actually worrisome to see this if someone is looking to purchase a boat. That thing could be cleaned up to look like new for some unexpected buyer.
1041818,BillM,2019-03-21 14:30:00,17367,Word is the guy who owned that boat died and the boat was never taken out of the water.
1041823,KawarthaAngler,2019-03-21 14:47:00,273,That rumor makes the picture less fun.
1041824,BillM,2019-03-21 14:56:00,17367,"Thought I'd mention it before guys start busting balls about leaving a boat in the water during the winter, lol."
1041826,JoePa,2019-03-21 15:05:00,179,Spring means for me to start getting firewood for next year - try to get it early so it has time to dry out over the summer - burned 5 full sized cords this past winter - all out of it now - once that is done then I can concentrate on fishing
1041827,lew,2019-03-21 16:34:00,12766,Real shame nobody could help the family out and pull those boats but I spose we don't know the whole story.
1041838,Old Ironmaker,2019-03-21 18:39:00,8243,"We always shot for April 1st for our first game of Golf, snow in the shadows of the Pines many times. If I tee up a ball and don't need to wear long John's it's spring. More than a few times we fished open water of the outflow at Nanticoke in March. I don't care what the calendar says if I can fish or golf then and only then it's spring. Or I should say we used to fish and golf. Open water here on Erie a few hundred yards from shore. A week ago it was solid to the horizon. I wonder how many are going through the ice this weekend? Hopefully zero but I doubt it."
1041873,jimmer,2019-03-22 16:19:00,2730,I was actually thinking that when I was posting.  There is usually a reason behind everything abnormal.
1041885,BassMan11,2019-03-22 18:19:00,583,Back yard still has about a foot here in Ottawa. Shes dropping fast though. Hopefully won't be to long now. Kind of a sad picture with those 2 boats in the water. Neglected one way or another.
1042084,FishGuy3754,2019-03-27 19:45:00,23,Not too much ice left here in KW. Creeks are flowing.
1042085,BillM,2019-03-27 19:47:00,17367,"Yeah, I don't know anyone with that much $$$ invested in a boat that would leave it like that for the winter."
1042098,jimmer,2019-03-28 14:09:00,2730,"Yes, very sad situation. However, I do see boats in driveways left uncovered all winter, which can be just as bad. I shake my head every time I drive by them."
1042147,SirCranksalot,2019-03-29 03:19:00,3291,and no spring would be complete without.................... 
1042149,dave524,2019-03-29 10:32:00,4508,"Walked the yard on skunk patrol before letting the dogs out ,  shone the flashlight down at a bare spot and there was dew worms/nightcrawlers out at 5:45 AM, temp was 4.5 C, obviously didn't freeze last night.  update: 3-29 10PM , tons of them out tonite."
1042168,Fisherman,2019-03-29 15:29:00,7201,"Ya, couldn't believe that either until I saw a robbin just a bobbin and crankin on a big dewey this morning."
1042180,AKRISONER,2019-03-29 18:24:00,5558,"on my lake if my neighbor died, you be sure as hell id be in there taking his boat out for him. I guess its just not the same on all of our lakes."
