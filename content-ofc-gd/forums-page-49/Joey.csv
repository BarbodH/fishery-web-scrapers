1042121,Squid,2019-03-28 19:09:00,1656,Can't believe that it has been over two years for Joeys passing. She took some amazing photos and was one of the sweetest ladies around. How are you doing Tybo??  
1042123,misfish,2019-03-28 19:12:00,29133,"You got that right Pete. Paul was to come out fishing the last weekend of the season,but picked up a nasty flu."
1042124,Whopper,2019-03-28 19:15:00,2174,"I'll second that Pete, those two were a real hoot to be around. I kind of miss the old days of getting together on the West Arm and St Clair"
1042125,Squid,2019-03-28 19:24:00,1656,Those were the best times ever. Boy did we have a feast of fish on the rock!! I remember being in greencouchdogs?? cabin and being offered a shot of moonshine. I was already feeling really warm and said sure that's not going to hurt (sure) . We all took a swig and in less than 5 mins my eyes went cross eyed and I ended up on my bed in my tent with the huge tarp over it asleep like a baby until the morning. Good times.
1042126,irishfield,2019-03-28 19:35:00,26272,A MUCH missed part of the gang...  
1042129,Terry,2019-03-28 20:00:00,14456,she is missed
1042130,lew,2019-03-28 20:12:00,12766,She sure is Terry and the girls still wear the purple T-shirts in Joey's honour every year when we head north. 
1042132,mikeh,2019-03-28 20:36:00,824,Always enjoyed reading her posts snd had great pictures
1042134,kickingfrog,2019-03-28 22:24:00,8333,"One of the first conversions I had with her started out: ""So you're the one in the cooler?"" And then: ""Tell the story of the giant carp you caught icefishing"""
1042135,Rizzo,2019-03-28 22:28:00,4754,I remember when that pike got stuck to her arm via a lure they were both attached to. One tough lady!
1042138,BillM,2019-03-28 23:12:00,17367,Awesome lady.  Shared many a PM with her about Snowy Owls and how she always had the best luck finding the buggers.  Even offered to meet up and show me some of her spots.    Wish I got to actually meet her in person.
1042140,HTHM,2019-03-28 23:20:00,4082,"I remember being welcomed into their home, dropping something off as I recall, and not wanting to leave because of the incredible hospitality that both Joey and Tybo showered on me. Pity there is nothing in the In Memorium section about her."
1042141,GBW,2019-03-28 23:21:00,8460,It's funny cause a FB memory came up the other day about a 'reminder' and it was something she had posted on a few years ago in the comments to that post.  She was a great person and we too had some great chats.
1042148,Big Cliff,2019-03-29 10:17:00,6899,"I miss her beautiful smile, and the way her eyes just lit up. Her incredible hugs, we'll it was something I always looked forward too. She was a very special lady."
1042153,woodenboater,2019-03-29 12:20:00,2277,"never had the honour/ privilege of meeting her but regret not buying one of her fish prints, they were absolutely beautiful."
1042161,Loonietoon,2019-03-29 15:06:00,1450,She was always part of the great times we had at GTG anywhere.... She and the others that have left us are truly  MISSED ☹️
1042164,glen,2019-03-29 15:17:00,2641,She sure had some great fishing stories.  Very nice to talk to. 
1042291,BassMan11,2019-04-01 11:19:00,583,A couple people in this picture gone way to soon.
1042306,TJQ,2019-04-01 16:52:00,7806,She is surely missed.
