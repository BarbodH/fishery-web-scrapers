1040497,captpierre,2019-02-15 15:31:00,2521,Have some time and kinda would like to go this weekend but last year I was disappointed in the Spring Show. Sportsman Show a lot bigger. Or go to both ?
1040510,bigugli,2019-02-15 18:10:00,6138,I found the Sportsman Show to be rather disappointing last year. That's why more people are coming out to small venues like the Niagara Outdoor show  https://www.niagaraoutdoorshow.com/ The Bowmanville Tackle Swap Mar 10th   and the Ancaster Tackle SwapMar 23rd
1040511,Acountdeleted,2019-02-15 18:16:00,2562,The only one that I saw that has Super Dogs is the Sportsman show. I'm going to that one because the wife will come to watch the dogs which means I can stay longer and spend more money.
1040513,Jon,2019-02-15 18:54:00,209,"I prefer the Sportsman's Show. Seems to be more to do and see. And the Sportsman's Show is much more of a tradition for me. It may not be much of an incentive for some, but if you purchase your Sportsman's Show tickets on-line this weekend, you also get a 1 year OFAH membership.

1040531,porkpie,2019-02-16 18:57:00,2521,I’m only doing the smaller tackle swaps now.  I’m done with the sportsman and the fishing shows.  Too much money and not a whole lot going on!
1040541,Snidley,2019-02-17 16:38:00,620,"I'm with Porkpie on this. The small tackle swaps are more fun, better deals and free parking too."
1040542,kfn,2019-02-17 17:36:00,14,Ditto for myself also.
1040543,Freshtrax,2019-02-17 21:28:00,2215,saved a few hundred bucks a the raidoworld booth.
1040554,Lape0019,2019-02-18 20:52:00,647,"Enjoyed my day heading to the Spring fishing and Boat show. I drove up from close to Ottawa so stopped in at Pro Advantage on the way up and hit Bass pro on the way home. They had almost every bass boat brand I could want to look at (Skeeter was there, but no bass boat) and quite a few dealers there showcasing new product with some sales mixed in here and there. Excellent way to spend a day dreaming on fishing. "

1040556,lew,2019-02-18 22:09:00,12766,Loved my Skeeter that wasn't a bass boat 
1040578,Lape0019,2019-02-19 16:26:00,647,That is quite similar to what was there. Very nice rig. Just not what I was looking for. Most of the multi species boats there were aluminum so that one definitely stood out.
1040787,David Chong,2019-02-25 02:05:00,836,"Yes, there was a Skeeter WX1910 there but Huntsville Marine does have a great deal on a Skeeter ZX225 if you're looking for a bassboat!"
1041856,Hack_Fisherman,2019-03-21 23:52:00,720,"I found the show disappointing. There’s lots of great boats to drool  over and take Notes To modify mine  but I was hoping to find a few key pieces I wanted to pick up this year such as inflatable PFD‘s, tackle systems and some specific salmon lures,  but no such luck. I wasn’t really in the mood to shop so that might’ve been part of the problem. I didn’t see any great deals on lures anyway. I probably should’ve gone to the boat show a few weeks earlier"
1041857,Tjames09,2019-03-22 02:51:00,664,I’m finding the sportsman show to be more of a flea market now. Lots of junk for sale completely unrelated to outdoors. And even the outdoor stuff is either full retail price (when Sail does 15-20% off in the spring) or it’s bottom barrel stuff.  Theres a couple useful booths and and I spent the better part of a day there. Just feel like it’s a big flea market now.
1041861,pics,2019-03-22 12:48:00,1268,Unfortunately these shows have become unaffordable for vendors so many no longer attend. There used to be a lot of good deals but that won't cover the cost of the booth.  The cannabis product booth was interesting..lol
1041868,David Chong,2019-03-22 14:31:00,836,"For those of us who remember the Toronto Sportsmen Show and the original Spring Fishing Shows, today's shows will never live up to expectations. The cost of attending shows for outfitters, retailers & manufacturers have become cost prohibitive. They're still a great way to the juices somewhat flowing as we approach spring and ice out! Still, love the watching the dogs and the MNR exhibit etc."
1041870,lew,2019-03-22 15:38:00,12766,Sadly the best days of the Sportsman Shows are long gone.
