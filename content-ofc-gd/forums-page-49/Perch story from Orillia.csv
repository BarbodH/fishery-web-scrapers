1041585,Terry,2019-03-15 17:59:00,14456,"i see it as a dumping problem with little to do with fishing looks like 10  lbs not 100 and from my point of view 	the guys is dumping garbag, it has little to do with fishing, if he had a bag of dirty diapers he would throw that out too would the guy that found it call the children's aid over it 	if he through out old basket balls would the guy that found it call the NBA, no  cause it is a littering dumping problem not a basketball problem"
1041591,Fisherman,2019-03-15 21:34:00,7201,"Who knows, maybe the odd fillet in there full of white grubs.  But, a dumping problem at best, some lazy bugger that could have sent that to the green recycle or soil enrichment program."
1041598,Rizzo,2019-03-15 22:51:00,4754,"Not that I agree with this...but maybe he figured some animal, or several animals, would get free meals out of this. Better to feed some coyotes than put in landfill?? Again, I don't agree but I can see this logic"
1041599,porkpie,2019-03-15 22:53:00,2521,"They are looking into the alleged fish filets left to spoil.  Wanton waste.  And frankly it’ll just be lip service to appease the complainant because your not going to CSI a pile of fish guts so unless buddy left an old bill with his name on it in the pile, that’s not going anywhere!"
1041603,Old Ironmaker,2019-03-15 23:58:00,8243,"A poorly written article. We usually feed the guts to a buddies 3 Huskies, they will eat anything. I have no problem leaving the guts from a few fish on our land a hundred feet from the cottage. Yes they attract critters, better than putting it in the garbage in the shed and stinking to high Heaven. They will rip the door up trying to get to it."
