Bought some fresh, wild caught Whiting for the first time. Whole fish. 10-12 inches.  Pan fried like a speckie. Head off, guts out, salt and pepper and coat  in flour. Fry till brown in butter.  Crispy skin- no scaling needed. Beautiful mild white meat.  Cost about $1 each. 3 of those cuties and I was happy.  "
1041943,OhioFisherman,2019-03-24 18:02:00,6623,Sounds like they are similar to the Alaskan Pollock except for size?
1041944,BillM,2019-03-24 18:56:00,17367,Shore fish for those in Florida anytime we're down there.  Oldman loves eating them.
1041947,Chuck Enwinde,2019-03-25 04:00:00,247,Picked some up around the same time last year.  Can confirm that late ice pike also love eating them.

1041962,misfish,2019-03-25 20:53:00,29133,"Fisherman buying fish, whats wrong with this ? LMAO "
1041963,Mike Pike,2019-03-25 20:57:00,1332,It's ok if you're a freshwater fisherman and buying saltwater fish.
1041964,misfish,2019-03-25 21:15:00,29133,"Was all in fun. I buy cod the odd time when it,s on sale. I will how ever,never buy the ice land cod ever again. There is no taste of the salt water ocean at all.  Very bland."
1041995,Mike Pike,2019-03-26 15:18:00,1332,"I was just jokin' too.  lol   When my buddies give me a hard time about buying fish because I haven't caught any, I always use that line."
