1041540,captpierre,2019-03-14 20:14:00,2521,Checked things out today.  Seems to be less to see than last year. No smokin deals. Tried to buy a couple Honda Inverter Generators. 2200s. Buddy was willing to give me a whole 4% show discount. ?. Sat in on Big Jim’s seminar.  I do like his jigs.  Stocked up.

1041933,grt1,2019-03-24 03:44:00,638,"I went to the boat show in Winnipeg, (used to be an all round fishing show with tackle booths and distributors) but this year there was only 1 fishing booth and they had little on the ""show discount"" available. Cabelas only sponsored a cooking demonstration and there was one spot 8 feet wide at the back of the booths, beside the food court (also 1 booth with cold hot dogs and pop and chips) for a guy to try to teach you how to use a fly rod and cast with it. there was also a small area where kids could practice throwing an axe. all in all it was a large disappointment. it cost 15 bucks a person . I spent 3 1/2 hours there, cost 16 bucks for parking at the site, so it was almost 50 bucks to see some fancy boats the average guy couldn't afford "
1041935,pics,2019-03-24 11:47:00,1268,Seems these things have become more about making money than anything.  I know a guy who owns a food truck and the food vendor prices are as much as $9000 for a 4 day outdoor event. I imagine it could be even higher for an indoor event.. throw in wages and health inspection costs and you have to sell a lot to make any profit..
