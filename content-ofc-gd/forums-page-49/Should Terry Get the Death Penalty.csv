1041549,OhioFisherman,2019-03-15 00:20:00,6623,If you feel a need to intentionally cheat you shouldn't be allowed to play.
1041552,Rizzo,2019-03-15 01:32:00,4754,weird rules

1041563,jimmer,2019-03-15 14:33:00,2730,Ban him from tournaments. It's not the first time someone was caught cheating.
1041567,David Chong,2019-03-15 15:14:00,836,Should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law!

1041575,jimmer,2019-03-15 16:33:00,2730,"Okay, put him in jail!"
1041580,BillM,2019-03-15 16:57:00,17367,"Lead weights in salmon, filling them with water.  It will never end, lol."
1041581,jimmer,2019-03-15 17:07:00,2730,There are people that do a lot worse to others in this world and never spend a day in jail or get prosecuted. Great that those that weigh in and measure caught it. Maybe someone can break his fishing rods!
1041597,Rizzo,2019-03-15 22:46:00,4754,"yes...I know there are slot sizes, but I have only heard of this for species like walleye/pickerel...ie fish that people actually want to eat. I had not heard of a slot size on bass before (there are really that many people wanting to eat them that you need a slot? gross). Also, why not choose a lake where there is no slot to have your tournament? Seems kinda dumb that a guy who catches 9 22 inch bass loses the tournament to some guy who brings in 5 18 inchers.  Lots about this seems weird."
1041608,OhioFisherman,2019-03-16 01:24:00,6623,"Lake Fork is well known as a trophy size bass fishery and the slot limits are designed to keep it one, the thought is the 16 - 24 inch bass are the prime spawners? Even Ohio has slot limit lakes for bass, to encourage bigger than average size fish? "" Black bass For largemouth bass, length limit is a 16-24” slot. Bass 16 inches and less or 24 inches or greater in length may be retained. Only one bass 24 inches or greater may be retained each day. For smallmouth bass (if present), minimum length = 14 inches. No minimum length on spotted, Guadalupe, and Alabama bass (if present.) Daily bag limit for all species = 5 black bass in combination. "" Lake Fork rules, they apply to everyone?
