1042176,jimmer,2019-03-29 17:54:00,2730,It never seems to stop when we talk about invasive species.
1042179,dave524,2019-03-29 18:21:00,4508,I'm trying to figure how they could be any worse than Common Carp and there is a kazillion of them in Hamilton Harbour already.
1042184,jimmer,2019-03-29 19:18:00,2730,I think they breed more often than the common carp. 
1042185,jimmer,2019-03-29 19:20:00,2730,Then we'll have a million kazillion goldfish on top of the kazillion carp.
1042186,jimmer,2019-03-29 19:21:00,2730,"Maybe that's all that can live in there, so better them than nothing.  Has anyone ever eaten a big goldfish?"
1042204,John Bacon,2019-03-30 13:24:00,3277,There is plenty of other fish besides carp and goldfish in Hamilton Harbour.
1042223,Jon,2019-03-30 19:30:00,209,Here is a link to a web-site showing the acoustic telemetry projects in the Great Lakes. Great Lakes Acoustic Telemetry Observation System There are some pretty interesting things happening out there. Jon
1042225,Rizzo,2019-03-30 19:59:00,4754,"HAha...classic journalism. It reads ""Goldfish can grow up to 25 cm in length""....and then immediately below that is a picture of a 40 cm goldfish."
1042313,David Chong,2019-04-01 19:57:00,836,I've been catching wild goldfish for over 45 years in Lake Ontario and other small bodies of water around the GTA! Interesting how they're worried about them now!
1042317,OhioFisherman,2019-04-01 21:17:00,6623,"LOL, I remember seeing them as a kid around the breakwalls at the Cleveland lakefront, never any small ones though."
1042338,Freshtrax,2019-04-02 04:25:00,2215,better start buying goldfish for walleye bait when fishing the harbor
1042371,Mike Pike,2019-04-02 17:29:00,1332,"Yup, I do too Ohio.  As a kid on the other side of the Erie shoreline closer to Windsor, I remember following a small school of brightly coloured goldfish, just cruising the shoreline.  That's around 50 years ago so it's definitely not a new phenomenon."
1042383,Mike Pike,2019-04-02 18:12:00,1332,"Warming water temps, lower oxygen levels, etc., in the harbour are symptoms of a much larger issue. After hundreds of years, we've created an environment that's becoming more suited to the Goldfish( and carp )than to some of our native species.  We're spending millions of dollars trying to eradicate 'non-native' species from habits they are now adaptable too, while the will and means to restore the habitat to its original form doesn't exist. In many ways, I think the genie is out of the bottle and we got what we got."
1042388,Headhunter,2019-04-02 19:22:00,5703,Sounds like a good reason to hold a GTG to see who gets the biggest goldie! HH
1042390,Terry,2019-04-02 19:29:00,14456,Right on par with ugliest shirt gtg
