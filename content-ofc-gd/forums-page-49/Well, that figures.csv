1042199,lew,2019-03-30 11:51:00,12766,My plan all week was to take off the winter tires today and put the summer ones on but as I sit here looking out the window it's snowing so hard I can hardly see the end of the yard LOL 
1042201,Whopper,2019-03-30 12:52:00,2174,Do me a favor Lew and keep it up there
1042202,Fisherman,2019-03-30 13:22:00,7201,"Car was done yesterday, truck will wait another week.  Feel sorry for the robins."
1042203,kickingfrog,2019-03-30 13:22:00,8333,I was going to swap the tires on at least on of the vehicles yesterday but saw the forecast for some snow today and figured I'd wait and see… The snowsbrush stays in the trunk until at least early May though. 
1042205,lew,2019-03-30 13:30:00,12766,"The turkeys didn't mind this mornings snow, they just took over the bird feeder. "
1042209,Fisherman,2019-03-30 14:38:00,7201,These ladies just couldn't resist oatmeal cookies in the dead of winter. https://www.facebook.com/DjmFri/videos/10152301670668307/?t=3
1042214,BillM,2019-03-30 15:45:00,17367,April is always the month the snows get taken off.  Mother nature loves to toss you a curve ball
1042215,lew,2019-03-30 15:48:00,12766,I said to heck with Mother Natures curve balls Bill and just finished switching the tires & wheels over LOL
1042216,lew,2019-03-30 15:55:00,12766,"That's a great video and even though we've got a ton of them in the yard all the time, specially now that it's mating season, I haven't got them eating outta my hand. Pretty cool birds though and I enjoy having them around. "
1042221,irishfield,2019-03-30 17:32:00,26272,Yep..same crap here... 
1042227,kickingfrog,2019-03-30 20:09:00,8333,"Wayne, I wonder if you could train some of your turkeys to eat some cranberry cookies?"
1042229,kickingfrog,2019-03-30 20:14:00,8333,"Ya, says the guy with the nice, big garage as I remember. Just like baseball, I do mine outside. lol"
1042253,lew,2019-03-31 08:14:00,12766,"Woke up this morning to 6"" of snow, perhaps I should have listened to Mother Nature after all LOL"
1042257,Fisherman,2019-03-31 13:31:00,7201,Time to go rent a tiger torch and speed up the melting process.
1042259,lew,2019-03-31 14:07:00,12766,I've got one but with the crazy amount of snow we got last night there's probably not enough propane in the entire township to melt it all LOL 
1042260,misfish,2019-03-31 14:47:00,29133,"I woke up to the same Lew. Heard the plows going by at 4am. Was going to hit the western tribes , looked outside and said,sleep in day. I can miss one day of fishing.LOL"
1042267,Sinker,2019-03-31 17:44:00,8692,My snows stay on until May. They are great in mud as well..... ...I was glad to have them last night driving from bowmanville to PTBO in a white out. Couldn't see a thing!!  S.
1042268,lew,2019-03-31 18:28:00,12766,I  always change mine about the beginning of April Shane but I'm OK as I don't have a schedule and if we get snow I just wait for a day....one of the perks of retirement LOL

1042378,bigbuck,2019-04-02 17:49:00,2449,"Lew, living in the north ish country, I'd wait till mid April. That said, you are retired so unless it's urgent, you don't have to leave the house."
