The bite was pretty much on for the whole hour or so before it started getting dark. Roloff has not been fishing with me for a while as he is getting on a bit now and has difficulty with long treks in the snow, so a trip to the bridge now it is warmer was right up his alley!  "

1041708,JoePa,2019-03-18 22:57:00,179,Actually a dog is probably the best fishing buddy - he doesn't complain or want his own way - you can call all the shots -be careful with the hooks so he doesn't get one stuck in his mouth
