1042136,wkrp,2019-03-28 22:53:00,656,I find the price for these so called high end coolers a bit much for me. It is becoming the norm and every  cooler company is jumping on the bandwagon. Heck you can buy a home freezer for less than one of these  2 inch insulated plastic boxes. Rant over
1042139,BillM,2019-03-28 23:13:00,17367,Waste of money.  Go look at some of the tests they do against a normal Colman.   Definitely not worth the $$$ in my books.
1042142,Fisherman,2019-03-28 23:56:00,7201,"What Bill said,  some were pretty close to the specs that the high end ones claim.  I use the Coleman Xtreme series,  if you really need to go for more than 4-5 days, go get a small block of dry ice."
1042154,porkpie,2019-03-29 12:25:00,2521,No way I’d spend that kind of coin on an ice box.  I bought a big white Coleman on clearance at Canadian tire for the boat. Works well enough other than having to replace the cheap plastic hinges with some innertube rubber.

1042183,DanD,2019-03-29 19:08:00,2223,"Last Xmas my son in-law gave me a 26 quart ""Ozark trail"" cooler. Never looked up the cost; but it has to be the best coolers I have ever used. Last summer it road on the back seat of my 50 Chevy (NO air conditioning) on the way up to Elk Lake. I had it filled with different cheeses, milk, butter and whatever else and a load of ice from the ice maker from the fridge. A 7 hour drive and a couple of hours before getting to unpacking this cooler. Hardly any of the ice had melted and everything in the cooler was still nice and cold. The only thing about this cooler, is its weight; empty it weighs approx 16Lbs. From where or whatever that weight comes from, it sure is doing its job. Last winter Ice fishing we put our pop/mix in the cooler to stop the cans from freezing, LOL Dan."
1042200,singingdog,2019-03-30 11:54:00,1047,Then there is the downside of owning a Yeti: having to lock it up. My favorite new ridiculous cooler is the 6 pack sized Pelican soft-side that costs $350 and is......wait for it.......black. Rocket scientists.
1042206,John Bacon,2019-03-30 13:30:00,3277,But is the Coleman bear proof...   ? 
1042208,Fisherman,2019-03-30 14:35:00,7201,Depends how sharp the sawzall is the last bear was carrying.
1042212,John Bacon,2019-03-30 15:32:00,3277,It sounds like you hang around with a different kind of bear than what I was referring to...
1042213,Fisherman,2019-03-30 15:36:00,7201,They just call over their domesticated toronto raycoons and pop the latches for them.
