1041985,Squid,2019-03-26 11:29:00,1656,that is crazy! Must be over an hour wait to launch and then to find parking!!

1042004,OhioFisherman,2019-03-26 17:07:00,6623,"LOL Brian a couple more weeks of this weather and my son can start harvesting our grass crop! Too bad there isn't much of a market for that type of home grown! We have had some 50 - 60 degree days and snowflakes the next day, typical March weather here. I hope you can get out fishing soon!"
