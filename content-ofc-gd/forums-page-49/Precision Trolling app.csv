1042233,kickingfrog,2019-03-30 21:45:00,8333,"And if you have a copy of the book, people are asking mucho dinero for them online."
1042239,irishfield,2019-03-30 23:03:00,26272,"I have that book somewhere, consider it new, unopened, never read.....  how much you wanna pay???"
1042241,kickingfrog,2019-03-30 23:29:00,8333,"I don't know what people are getting for them but there are several used ones online asking several hundred dollars (at least one was over $600). I love books but I'd sell it in a heartbeat and have a current, always updated version on my phone."
1042242,Terry,2019-03-30 23:31:00,14456,Cut the book apart photocopy it and sell it cheaper
1042243,kickingfrog,2019-03-30 23:41:00,8333,That's one way to pay for those cars.
1042247,porkpie,2019-03-31 00:22:00,2521,"I've never used the app, I'm still on the book.  I belong to a couple of forums dedicated to trolling, and most seem happy with the app.  Kinda hard to recommend something you've never used though.  I've thought of selling my book and getting the app though as you say, it's nice to have the most up to date info and its probably a heck of a lot easier than breaking out the book."
1042279,Yellow Fever,2019-03-31 23:33:00,139,"Trust me...get the APP with the lifetime membership ( more than $100.00 ) it""s a no brainier, I have had mine for years and get constant updates. If you are a serious fisherman its the way to go"
