1041635,Gerritt,2019-03-17 00:34:00,6129,Looks like the feds have stepped in...  https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/feds-cautioned-ontario-on-proposed-cormorant-hunt-1.5059306
1041636,BillM,2019-03-17 00:45:00,17367,All they said was that hunters 'could' get charged if hitting other species..    Nothing about it being scrapped.
1041637,cisco,2019-03-17 01:16:00,597,"Bill the hunters could be charged not for 'hitting' other migratory species but for disturbing them while they were nesting. That is a judgement call in the field. A way for the anti-hunting bios to stop a hunt. I very much doubt many other migratory birds are close to cormorant nesting sites. Any that are, that experience any nesting failure would be inconsequential IMHO."
1041638,BillM,2019-03-17 01:19:00,17367,"So it's like catching out of season bass while pike fishing in the spring?    'Could' be charged and 'Charged' are two very different things, lol."
1041639,dave524,2019-03-17 02:11:00,4508,"It would be the RCMP that would have to lay those charges, I expect you would be OK with the Provincial CO's unless you were really screwing up other species. "
1041655,OhioFisherman,2019-03-17 16:00:00,6623,??? If you were to shoot 50 of them in one day? What the heck would you do with them? Do people eat them?
1041656,G.mech,2019-03-17 16:34:00,830, Why is that?  The OMNRF enforce the migratory bird laws that are federal not the RCMP....not all federal laws have to be enforced by RCMP.
1041663,dave524,2019-03-17 22:12:00,4508,"I used to work at Long Point and lived in Port Rowan, quite a while ago, it was the Mounties that enforced a lot of the migratory game bird stuff including setting up roadblocks on the causeway spot checking duck hunters , the CO's at that time stuck mostly to enforcing small game, sport and commercial fishing. There was a lot of CWS sanctuary land there and both the MNR and CWS had land open to hunters as well.  If the fed's are setting up a roadblock to the provincial commorant shoot I would expect that our CO's would leave you alone and the  RCMP might bust you.  A situation not unlike the legal cannabis states where the local police are OK with it but the American Federal Custom guys will bust you if returning from a trip and have some in possession. "
1041664,dave524,2019-03-17 22:14:00,4508,Plant them in the garden along with the grass carp.
1041665,BillM,2019-03-17 22:26:00,17367,"Nothing, let them sink to the bottom."
1041666,Terry,2019-03-17 23:01:00,14456,Yeah let the fish eat them for a change
1041670,cisco,2019-03-18 00:20:00,597,Fisheries are also Federal. Transfer payments from the Federal gov't to Provincial governments is what I understand pays/contracts fisheries and migratory bird enforcement out to our COs. I expect the OMNR and CWS will be giving an announcement re the things they will be laying charges for. Expect a uniform enforcement approach from both the CWS and OMNR officers.
