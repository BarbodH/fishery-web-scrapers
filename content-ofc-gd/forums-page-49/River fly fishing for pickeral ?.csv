Never really thought about fishing for them,BUT, they are in the same water system I will be fishing for trout.   Been told to bring a rod to dunk worms, but I want to just take one fly  rod combo. I am thinking I could get away with the sanwan worm. Maybe make it thicker then the trout version .  While I am tying my trout flys for this up coming season, I thought if there was a fly for pickeral, I would try my hand at it, and give it a go.  Anyone toss flys for river pickeral ? If you fly fish for walleye,I would like to hear from you as well."

1041715,Jmeyer,2019-03-19 01:21:00,83,"I've caught them with bead head wooley buggers or leach patterns while fishing for trout. Always in August while fishing trout deep with sinking leader or split shot, pike were hitting them too. Awesome feeling catching the trifecta in on pool."

1041718,Chuck Enwinde,2019-03-19 05:33:00,247,"I'd go with a woolly bugger or an eggsucking leech. And Jay, I love pike but I'd have to give it a stern talking to, before releasing it in to a pool with brookies."

1041724,Moosebunk,2019-03-19 13:12:00,3970,"Used to chuck bugs now and again when living in the Moose Brian.  Up on the North French and Cheepas in spring when they're shallower, I did best with a weighted chartreuse wholly bugger.  Pink would do well too.  And as Gil pointed out, Clousers just like the ones he's posted caught a fish or two as well."
1041736,misfish,2019-03-19 21:40:00,29133,"Thanks all. Now to youtube these tie ups. I have lots of wollys, and egg sucking leach patterns already. Will have to tie some weighted ones."
