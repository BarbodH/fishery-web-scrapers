Im not a big percher guy and I dont use live bait,so using baits not so familiar to me is a challenge. The morning was beautiful. Little wind and the sun was coming up.    Drilled my first hole and I was WT%#%$ Dirty brown water 1/2 mile out.  Moved out another 1/2 and found some water that was fishable. First fish was a dink,then the 2nd was a whopper It measured 14 1/2 on the button. Pic does not show this fish justice    Ended the morning with 6 perch. Just enough for a fresh dinner.   .  "
