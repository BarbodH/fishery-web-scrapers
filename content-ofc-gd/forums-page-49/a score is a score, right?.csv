1042226,Rizzo,2019-03-30 20:08:00,4754,"hmmm....maybe I am reading this wrong but are they claiming that Buffet Rig goes for $10 elswehere (or maybe even in their own store?). Seems like the price is inflated to show a huge savings. Either way, you got some new lures and that can't be a bad thing! Plus you scored 7 cents crapy tire money!"
1042230,irishfield,2019-03-30 20:47:00,26272,Here I thought you'd found some tramp in Lindsay..
1042232,LeXXington,2019-03-30 21:36:00,1928,What!! That never happens at Crapy Tire..   I have to wait all year for the 80% of screw driver set ?
1042234,Hack_Fisherman,2019-03-30 21:50:00,720,"Yeah, or a $400 socket set on sale for $99 and they are still making gobs of profit"
1042240,irishfield,2019-03-30 23:05:00,26272,"Best deal is the MIG welder that is on sale every 2 weeks for $200 vs $600 regular price. They ordered 50,000 by mistake instead of 5000. They work great too, even on 100 feet of 14/3 extension cord... "
