Had no problem last year hooking up. Just when I thought I had it mastered, life reminded me nothing is guaranteed. Couple of nice fish there Terry!"

Propane is to expensive, heat is my best friend out there, but this morning ,he begged like I was the cod father. LOL A quick few pointers, the keys transfered to me for the yamadoo, is all it took. Next thing I heard was, about %^^^# time. Arms flying in the air and doing the newfie jig. Well it was close."
