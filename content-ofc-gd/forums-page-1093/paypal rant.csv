153278,aniceguy,2008-01-22 22:36:00,1094,"Bought quite a few things from ebay, but never could understand the utter delay with paypal.  In todays financial climate banking transactions and clearing centers push the transactions through a fairly quick pace ( a cheque written today in toronto deposited today in toronto at 10 am is usually cleared by 5 that night.  Pay pal takes the money out of my account, sits with it for a 7 days and then the deposit is made into a sellers acct...What gives with this  Email sent to paypal a while back and still no response.  Anyone shed some light on this one?"
153282,Terry,2008-01-22 22:39:00,14456,seven days of interest in their pockets....do the math...LOL
153283,irishfield,2008-01-22 22:39:00,26272,Not sure what you have going on Louis...I've used Paypal for the last 6 years. Have shuffled about $3000 in and out the last three weeks selling aircraft parts that are surplus to my needs and using the money to buy...what else... fishing tackle ! Transactions are instant.
153285,Raf,2008-01-22 22:42:00,3495," only if you use a credit card Wayne.  You have the option to transfer funds between your bank account and paypal account, and that takes days.  Don't understand it either."
153287,FISHINGNUT,2008-01-22 22:43:00,253,I have spent thousands on Ebay and have never had a problem with Pay pal but that does suck if it delays your purchase because the seller didnt get his money write away
153291,solopaddler,2008-01-22 22:51:00,8605, That's correct. If you use a credit card there's no delays...
153292,irishfield,2008-01-22 22:52:00,26272, Okay thanks Raf.... I never use a bank account. I sell enough stuff and pay via the balance I keep there 'till I run out and have to use my credit card. Yah they get to make interest on my money..but using a bank account lets CRA have instant access to how much you're selling a year!
153294,Beats,2008-01-22 22:58:00,543,"I buy stuff on ebay with paypal all the time.  I have it setup with my bank account and my credit card as well.  I initally had it setup with just my bank account.  It took about a week or so to initially put some money from my bank account into my paypal account.  I then used that money to purchase things off ebay.  I since setup my credit card to my paypal account.  I did this because I don't like putting money into my paypal account from my bank account and just leaving it there til I need it.  Otherwise, you have to wait for Paypal to take it out of your bank account for you when you need it.  The way I have it now the money comes out of my credit card instantly when I make a purchase.  For example.  If I have 200$ from my bank account put into my paypal account and then make a 180$ purchase online, that leaves me with 20$ in the account.  Now, If I go on ebay and win an auction that costs me 100$, Paypal will take the last 20$ from my account and instantly take 80$ from my credit card and its a done deal leaving me with an empty account.  Using your credit card is much easier and requires no shuffling of funds."
153389,camillj,2008-01-23 03:05:00,1988,Heh .. I had noticed a similar problem shortly after getting 'validated' for auto-withdrawal (which was suposed to be so much better) instead of credit card ... anyhow I was considering turning off the bank account thing .. except there are some sellers who prefer the bank thingy -because its confirmed - even if its not always instant (apparantly it also depends on THEIR bank/currency/clearing)
153392,Joey,2008-01-23 03:09:00,9122,I've used Paypal for years and the longest has been about 3 or 4 days.  Never been a problem for me.   Sorry I can't help.  Joey
153393,aniceguy,2008-01-23 03:09:00,1094,thanks or the insite I ll add a credit card to it tonight makes more sense still dont get how the funds are out of my acct and still not transfered to the seller....guess the interest makes a difference to them...
