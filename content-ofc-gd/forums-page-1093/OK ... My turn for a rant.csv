By far the wisest choice i ever made, especially since propane has went through the roof, and we own 200 acres of land with about 70 being wooded.  All the dirt is outside,it burns seasoned or green wood, fill it once a day unless its real cold.  my house can be as warm as i want it and has very little risk of fire since it sets about 15-20 yards from the house.  After 3 years of use, it has paid for itself, and i still have 17 years of warranty left on it.  Best of luck getting everything fixed back to normal, hope ya got an electric blanket to stay warm.  jason"

All were returned to the store and replaced.  Maybe a 2nd. opinion from another tech will confirm what you were told. It can't hurt to shop around for prices and an alternative remedy. It's just like your car, leave it at the shop for a day and taking the word of the mechanic. If you aren't shown the defect and witness it with your own eyes then how can you put 100% of your faith in what he says?  Best of luck and stay warm."
153454,lew,2008-01-23 13:20:00,12767,"A similar thing happened to my Mom a couple years back Jon.  The furnace man came to her home to do a regular scheduled maintanance on her furnace and decided it was time for her to install a chimney liner and he immediately red-tagged her furnace, even though it was the dead of winter and the liner couldn't be installed for sevaral days.  Mom was 80 years old at the time, living alone and this guy had her terrified that the earth would come to an abrupt end if the furnace was turned back on before a new liner was installed.  She called me and I went over and convinced the guy that everything would be taken care of and just leave the furnace alone until the liner was installed. She'd lived in the home for 5 decades with no problems and another 72 hours wouldn't hurt.  Obviously we all have to be careful with these type of things, but I sometimes think the installers get panicked and carry things too far."
153536,Canuck2fan,2008-01-23 18:42:00,1444,"You have my sympathy... I just got home and found out that I have no heat in my apartment today. Apparently, Union Gas was here yesterday working on putting in a new meter and never turned the heat back on? I called the super and he came over but didn't even know the heat was off yet? It is 12 degrees C in here and falling like a stone. At least I don't have kids or a wife getting cold though..... I just hope Union Gas didn't red tag the furnace here and not tell anyone."
153541,TennesseeGuy,2008-01-23 19:03:00,957,When I'm too hot in the summer I go to a government building where the temperature is around 66 F.  When I'm too cold in the winter I go to a government building where the temperature is around 73 F.
153601,camillj,2008-01-23 22:11:00,1988,"Well.. thanks all .. the good news is ... I THINK ... I am getting a new furnace tomorrow ... gonna be a nother long night with 3 hr logs though .. we/'re down to 13 degrees .. just a little brisk for my liking but between the stove and the space heater and the fireplace at least the cats arent dead and the pipes arent froze ... the misses ... well she'll defrost when we actualy have a furnace  Good news is it starting to look more like $5g's now ... but unfortunately the fella that was supposed to 'drop by' to spec it all out for the 'big crane lift' tomorrow wont be by till tomorrow .... so I am only half expecting to be warm again by tomorrow night .. what with murphy and his pals always so keen to get involved ... but as I always like to say ... keep a stiff upper lip (at least the butter is staying hard ... which by the way goes really well on the fresh bread )   oh .. by the way .. company X was politely told that they could take a long HARD SUCK ON MY ARSE !... not only because they failed to show up last night with the afore-promised heaters ... but also because they were several hours later than promised on the quote/commitment to deliver ... and the misses insisted I start moving ahead with shall we say .... plan B ... the fact that theres almost $3,000 difference in from the original quote is honestly NOT the reason ... but I could definitely justify it to the board"
