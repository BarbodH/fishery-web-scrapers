153547,drwxr,2008-01-23 19:34:00,453,anyone tried or heard anything about his company? 
153552,Canuck2fan,2008-01-23 19:44:00,1444,I am very seriously considering switching because Execulink just upped my price by 2 bucks a month.....  Last year Acanac had a free 30 trial and I used it for about 7 days and found absolutely no difference in speed or service except that they didn't offer newsgroups.  A ton of RFDer's switched and the reviews were mixed but overall satisfactory. Bascially if you know what you are doing with DSL now you will probably be laughing. If you don't have a clue about what do to with problems now switching to Acanac won't make things better. One thing I did like was that Acanac did come to the thread on RFD and answer any question anyone had..... Bell never has an answer..... no matter how many services you have with them.
153553,Terry,2008-01-23 19:46:00,14456,"I talked about this company in another thread I got a friend onto it and seems fine that price is only for the first year, but the regular price is pretty good too"
153555,Gerritt,2008-01-23 19:51:00,6129,Yes but do they throttle torrent traffic.... if they dont that would be reason enough for me to switch.  G
153557,Terry,2008-01-23 19:58:00,14456,"if you read their ad, it states that they do not..but who knows well they don't really say they don't just that they do nothing to limit uploads and downloads"
153572,drwxr,2008-01-23 20:56:00,453,"well they use bell lines so if bell throtles it, there is nothing they can do, however they do have naked dsl service. the other thing is you have to pay $227.40 (tax incl.) for the whole year in one payment. but i just finished reading some reviews in dsl forums and overall rating was pretty good. will cancel my $50mth bell internet next month."
153577,jedimaster,2008-01-23 21:02:00,3472,"If the ""Man"" is throttling you, just make sure your encrypting your traffic, and randomising your port. Thats gets you past most throttling efforts. Off topid but since this is a re hash and someone else brought up my off topic comment I don't feel so bad."
153583,danbouck,2008-01-23 21:11:00,4380,I use www.295.ca I payed 19.99 for the first year and 24.99 after that. I've never had a problem with it.
153585,Terry,2008-01-23 21:14:00,14456,"I don't think the fact that bell throttles their customers, that it affects anyone else i believe that  only does it on their ip group"
153586,cplummer,2008-01-23 21:15:00,165,sounds ok.. i pay cogeco pro @ 86 a month but i need the super fast stuff...
153606,hhpeter,2008-01-23 22:23:00,6,I'm using Teksavvy they have 2 plans unlimited and 200GB a month not throttled If you want a GOOD costumer service anytime you have a problem with your connection I highly recommend them
153783,jjcanoe,2008-01-24 03:03:00,744,"We wanted to upgrade from dial-up (free through work) and looked around for some deals and then we called Bell and and told them we didn't want to pay 49.99/month for hi speed since there are others offering it in our area for around $35/month and as longtime customers what would they do for us.  Guess what they said. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Thanks for your business all those years and hi speed will cost $26/m for the first 6 months and then $35/m after that. Until when we asked? For as long as you want it said the bell rep. Great send us the modem to.....  Moral of the story, companies will reward loyal customers.  Just my $.02  jjcanoe"
153809,Hooked,2008-01-24 06:28:00,891,  Thats who I'm going with!  Check out www.dslreports.com and www.canadianisp.com for further investigation for yourself drwxr.
153866,drwxr,2008-01-24 16:49:00,453,"thanks, but now i hope that i will get same offer as jjcanoe when i call to cancel"
153907,cityfisher,2008-01-24 20:19:00,959,Ever heard of PRIMUS ??  59.99 a month includes.. DSL not limited... land line with 9 features.. unlimuted long distance in canada/us...  Not a bad deal  gonna switch next month
153908,Seaweed,2008-01-24 20:23:00,135,Well in my opinion.... you get what you pay for.  Never have I not been able to get on the internet with Rogers  That works for me.... plus I'm a V.I.P. so I get a bit off of everything.
153956,forrest,2008-01-24 23:08:00,1032," Sounds like you got the regular price for their ""up to"" 500kbps dsl line.  The $50 is a 5 000Kbps dsl line.   I pay the $50 but they have started throttling my P2P connection to 500kbps so I may be asking for my $15 back soon.  PS Bell support STINKS.  forrest"
153969,Gerritt,2008-01-24 23:45:00,6129,   Better think about your decision here... they have a CRAP load of BAD reviews brother... www.canadianisp.com  Your hard earned cash can be spent wisely elsewhere..  G
