153504,chickenhawk,2008-01-23 16:31:00,612,"Who's gonna win? Do you think the Pats will pull off the perfect season? Or will the Giants pull another upset?  My say is on the Giants, they have been playing amazing football lately and I also don't want Bill Bellichek to win another super bowl.  So GO ELI AND THE GIANTS!!!!"
153508,charlesn,2008-01-23 16:42:00,551,"Cheering for the Giants.  Go Cinderella!  Saw that it was reported Tom Brady was seen in a walking cast. Possibly a hoax.  But without Brady, the Pats are very mortal.  I just hope for a close game.  Charles"
153511,cplummer,2008-01-23 16:45:00,165,GIANTS  by 6
153521,kennyman,2008-01-23 17:42:00,737,"Honestly, I don't think even Strahan can stop the Pats. Normally between those two teams I wouldn't really care who won, but I've got a friend who just lost his wife that's a huge Giants fan, so I'll be rooting for them. Go Eli !!!!!"
153522,mufasa001,2008-01-23 17:47:00,37,"Pats win, but it will be close.  Brady is a master of the game winning drive, and will probably pull one off again.  Helps also that the cheating coach is also a genius.  The boot is nothing to be concerned with on Brady.  If it was serious, he would still be in Foxboro getting treatment, instead of visiting his super-model girlfriend in New York."
153576,suds,2008-01-23 21:00:00,70,"All I know for sure is that all the pressure is on the Pats to finish off the dream season. The Giants will be loose and ready.  If its as good as the last game of the year when they played, it'll be a dandy Superbowl.  hope I can remember it this year....."
153579,FUSION,2008-01-23 21:04:00,81,I do not think this will be a repeat of the last game of the season. Patriots 34 Giants 17 is my prediction for Super Sunday. I give the Giants credit for there little run here in the playoffs but there is no side of the ball they match up at as well as the Patriots. 
153580,jedimaster,2008-01-23 21:05:00,3472,I am gonna say one of two things will happen. Either the Pats will win in a no contest blowot from start to finish. Or the Giants will make a game out of it for the first quarter then it will be one sided.  As much as I HATE the Pats they are too good and they will destroy the Giants. I hope I am wrong...but thats just like I hope the Leafs win the cup this year.
153582,FUSION,2008-01-23 21:11:00,81,they are too good and they will destroy the Giants.   Smartest thing said in this thread so far... GO PATS!!!
153590,misfish,2008-01-23 21:27:00,29133," NOT, under dogs Giants all the way."
153599,jedimaster,2008-01-23 22:04:00,3472,"Like I said I am rooting for the Giants, and I swear at the Pats all day long when I am watching them... but lets just face reality here. The New York Football Giants are Toast."
153603,Rich Clemens,2008-01-23 22:16:00,3131,"Probably be a close game for most of the first half.  Seems like after half-time, the Patriots pull out the stops and win the games.  I'd love to see the Giants win and pull off the upset."
153608,solopaddler,2008-01-23 22:25:00,8605," Hey bud, I can't believe you chimed in LOL!  If I were you I wouldn't be so sure....you might be in for a big letdown....  My 4 year old daughter Riley says nobody can beat giants, they're too big! Can't argue with that logic, so I say the Pat's get squished!"
153627,FUSION,2008-01-23 23:03:00,81,This comming from a TigerCats fan... Sorry bud I had to hit you with that low blow. LOL! On the same topic I am going to try and get something together for the game if your interested???
153635,solopaddler,2008-01-23 23:14:00,8605, Let me run it by the warden and I'll get back to you  .
153658,Daplumma,2008-01-23 23:41:00,1961,The Giants have nothing to lose here so they will be loose and ready.I dont like the Giants but HATE the pats.Go Giants! Joe
153772,chickenhawk,2008-01-24 02:20:00,612,Like I said Giants are looking strong!
153782,danc,2008-01-24 03:01:00,4677,"The turf may be artificial, but the MOSS is real!!! Pats by 9. Moss is the MVP. You heard it here first."
