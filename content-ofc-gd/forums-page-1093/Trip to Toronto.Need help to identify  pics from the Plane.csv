153458,Mike the Pike,2008-01-23 13:31:00,3421,I went to Toronto Saturday for my annual sales meeting just got back last night.  Before we took off in Montreal the Captain mentioned we would be flying over lake Simcoe on our approach to Pearson International Airport.  Please tell me which bodies of water these lakes and rivers are.   #1   #2   #3  #4   #5   #6   #7   #8   #9   #10   #11   Yes I know this one the CN Tower.   I stayed at the Stagewest Hotel in Mississauga a very nice place to stay.  Just like last year we took in another great show called 70's fever. What a show many great old tunes from the 70's like the Bee Gees Rod Stewart and even a quick visit from the band Kiss .I think the highlight of the show was when a young lady came dressed and sang like Tina Turner belting out the famous song Proud Mary.She stole the show.So Cool!!!!!!!!!! If anyone has a chance check out the show.The food was very good and the show is worth every penny.  I was on the lookout for Trackers hut but I think he built it too small  Well hopefully I can get back to fishing this weekend.  Mike the Pike.
153460,ccmtcanada,2008-01-23 13:34:00,7971, The only one I can help you is this one.  That big blue thing behind the tower is Lake Ontario.  Glad I could help...LOL  Cliff
153462,mistyriver1,2008-01-23 13:36:00,600,"Just a couple of guesses Mike, but I think #4 is Chemong and #1 looks like Rice."
153468,mbac31,2008-01-23 13:45:00,904,"5,6,7,8 are I think of Scugog, 3 is the The Bay of Quinte."
153475,Sinker,2008-01-23 14:05:00,8692,"1....not sure.....pigeon maybe?  2 is round lake near Havelock  3 is scugog river.... lindsay is the built up area  4 is Chemong, that's the causeway at Bridgenorth.  5-6  are scugog.....looking south over Ball point towards Cesarea  7 is scugog.....looking at the North end of the island.....far left is ball point......see someopen water there.....yuck!  8 is scugog looking south towards port perry.....that's the west side of the island.....Kings bay on the right  9 on top of the wing is looking down towards port perry.  10 Kings bay on the bottom right, Goreskis marina just right of center on the west shore of the island  11. Almost the same as 10, but you can see the mouth of the Nonquon river on the right hand side......  Sinker"
153476,Sinker,2008-01-23 14:05:00,8692,Oh......cool pics BTW!! Thanks for posting those!  Sinker
153481,oldphart,2008-01-23 14:30:00,665,"~~~Way to go Sinker, I was away off, but on 2nd. look I believe you are right."
153485,Joey,2008-01-23 14:57:00,9122,Cool     Does Sinker win a prize  Good eye Sinker.  Joey
153492,irishfield,2008-01-23 15:26:00,26272,All I can tell you Mike is that you were sitting in the safest spot in the plane! When they break in half on landing..right behind the wing... you can run out thru the new gapping exit !
153500,Headhunter,2008-01-23 16:19:00,5703,"Wayne, you owe me a new key board and a cup of coffee! HH"
153502,irishfield,2008-01-23 16:25:00,26272,Glad I could help start your day Joe! Seriously though... is where I alway sit ...so you can read anything into that you like !
153515,fishindevil,2008-01-23 16:52:00,6254,"#11 is lake scugog,looking from the northwest area looking southeast great pics mike !!!!   and the rest is what sinker said....cheers"
153525,Blue_Axela,2008-01-23 17:59:00,88,#1 doesn't look like Rice.  Rice has a lot of islands on it.
153602,Sinker,2008-01-23 22:12:00,8692," I agree with Joey.....what do I win?    I think #1 is crowe lake, now that I think about it. That would be the crowe river on the north end you can see in the picture. Makes sense with the way the pictures were taken as well....crowe, round, chemong, scugog river, scugog lake.......you missed sturgeon and pigeon....the 2 most important ones.....  Sinker"
153750,Mike the Pike,2008-01-24 01:56:00,3421,Well thanks Sinker for helping me with those pics .I was really hoping to get a glimse of Simcoe I guess the pilot changed his course or perhaps I was on the wrong side of the plane eventhough Wayne said I was in a safe place lol.  
153755,fishing n autograph,2008-01-24 02:03:00,2540,#2 looks like Mussellman's lake in Whitchurch-Stouffville
153810,Anatz,2008-01-24 06:45:00,74,#2 Looks like Lake Wilcox.
153856,perodimi,2008-01-24 15:48:00,124,"Hi Folks,  I thought I could shed some light as I'm a pilot for Canada's flag carrier and have flown Montreal - Toronto many times.  When air traffic control (ATC) flows traffic into Toronto, they use four ""bedposts"" inbound. One from each direction and in this case (from the east) it's called the Simcoe arrival because it comes in just south of Lake Simcoe before it blends in with the landing pattern. In ths case, it appears you were being vectored around or actually in a hold right over Lake Scugog with left hand turns which gave you the great views. ATC does this as a delaying or ""metering"" tactic when things get backed up.  Sinker is right on the mark and very impressive if I may add! This first picture is Moira Lake near Madoc which you would've passed over first. Then as Sinker said, #2 is Round Lake near Havelock, #3 the causeway at Bridgenorth on Chemong and so on. He had me on the causeway because at first glance, it looked to me like the one in Port Perry.  I need a guy like him beside me when the passengers ask where we are! In our world, it's all waypoints and intersections in the sky and have little to do with geographic location. In this case, the pilot said you'll be flying over Lake Simcoe because they were doing the Simcoe Arrival, not because you were actually going to be over the lake itself. Most of our PA's to the passengers are general in nature as many wouldn't know where Lakes Scugog, Chemong, Moira etc. are.  Cheers!"
153858,Roy,2008-01-24 16:00:00,13728,"Very informative, Perodimi. Welcome aboard flight OFC!"
153865,douG,2008-01-24 16:38:00,2693,"Welcome to Perodimi.  Thanks for flying OFC, we hope your stay will be an enjoyable one."
154040,Sinker,2008-01-25 03:07:00,8692,"Ahhhh......moira....right....DUH!!  I knew I knew the lake, just couldn't put it in place.  perodimi, I'd join ya anytime!!  Thanks for your input!  Sinker"
154047,nofish4me,2008-01-25 03:30:00,404,"Welcome, Perodimi. Fasten your seatbelt, OFC can be a turbulent (""a set of mischievous, turbulent rebels"")  place at times.  PS. Just trying to become more than a ""Minnow"". LOL"
154097,perodimi,2008-01-25 13:15:00,124,"Thanks Everybody!  Great to be here, and although I have a great job, it still doesn't beat fishing!  Hope to see you all out on a lake somewhere...  Cheers,  Peter"
