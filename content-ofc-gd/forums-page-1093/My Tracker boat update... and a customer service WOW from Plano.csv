(Look at my old posts if you want the full details). Well. my boat is currently at Grumpy's Marine in Holland Landing (near Newmarket), being looked over and an estimate being sent out to Tracker. They still have not told me whether or not they will honor the warranty - I think they are waiting to see how much the repair of the defective rivets is going to be. But at least this is progress... hopefully some positive updates to follow...  I would also like to let you all know about a GREAT customer experience I just had with Plano (tacklebox company). I own two model 7592's, and over the past 4 years of heavy use, on one of them I managed to crack the lid, and the front panel as well. I emailed Plano to find out if I could order some replacement parts for it. Their response : ""The parts you have requested will be sent out to you at no cost."" Well, the parts arrived today! No shipping charges or anything! Just goes to show - there are still some companies out there that will go that extra mile for their customers!"

Had the same motor on it since I got it an 40 Tracker Force motor, and have not had any problem with it out side of the ones I've caused. Hope you get it straighten out before the lakes open, I use liquid weld to slow the leaks."
153542,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-23 19:15:00,1362, I've never heard of liquid weld.....Can I get this at CTC???
