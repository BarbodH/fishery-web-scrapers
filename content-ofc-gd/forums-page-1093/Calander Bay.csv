153377,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-23 02:29:00,0,"Stayed at Sunset. Nice cottages. Nice huts. Good fishing. You can use what ever you like. Simple dead line minnow or jig head and minnow. Spoons. It all has it's place and time. Pimples,Hawger and  even jigging raps. You name it. Everyone has their favourite. I use a 2"" Williams in copper but silver with glow works as well."
