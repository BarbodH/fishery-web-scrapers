153516,Hookset,2008-01-23 16:58:00,367,"Even though I'm a Leafs fan...  Pick any team other than the Leafs, The poor kid would be shell shocked 2 minutes into his first start.  Such a fine young man deserves better than the Leafs. I'd say they'd be better by the time he's old enough but I've been saying the same darn thing since '67.  Nice Picture BTW   Hookset."
153670,bucktail,2008-01-23 23:57:00,1857,I hear they are planning to draft Stevie Wonder!
153693,lookinforwalleye,2008-01-24 00:28:00,4399,"Like Cliff said in the past draft smaft...  Cliff can`t walk on water look at the hand he`s holding.  McCabe  3 more years at 5.75 million no trade clause, good luck in trying to do something with that.  Jason Blake 4 more years at 4 million a pop for a stiff,good luck in trying to do something with that.  Pavel Kubina 2 more years at 5 million a pop  Darcy Tucker 3 more years at 3 million a pop, most nights you have to look at the game sheet to see if he was even dressed.  Andrew Raycroft another year at 2 million  Vesa Toskala 2 more years at 4 million, was given a 2 year extension before he even put on a jersey. Smart  Good Luck Cliff your gonna need it.  If JFJ ever gets another job as a GM I will be shocked!!!  Signed...A habs fan."
