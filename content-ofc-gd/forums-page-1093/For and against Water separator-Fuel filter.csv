153456,Landlocked,2008-01-23 13:30:00,171,"Thanks...now is there any chance gas provided to the marinas would be any different?  I'm assuming not but just curious if anyone has heard anything different?  Bear with me, just getting through my first cup of coffee."
153463,ccmtcanada,2008-01-23 13:38:00,7971," Hmmm...I know you are looking into this further, but from what I gather here, 1997 mercs and newer can run up to 10% ethanol.  So what does this mean for my 1983?  Your other post says they also say not to use those separators...is that just on those newer models?  Hmmm....I'll keep watching this thread.  Thanks Bernie!"
153473,Sinker,2008-01-23 13:56:00,8692,"I just called around to 3 marine mechanics in my area, they ALL told me not to run a filter if I pre-mix my fuel/oil. Good chance of burning up the engine. One guy told me that sometimes the oil will get separated in the filter as well as the water....??  I'm just gonna run mine like I always do, my gas doesn't last long enough to go bad. I'd do something different if my gas was sitting around for a while though.........  Sinker"
153477,Bernie,2008-01-23 14:06:00,3190,What owners will need to watch out for or possibly replace are fuel lines. Older fuel lines were not designed for alcohol and may deteriorate. The deteriorated pieces may get into carburators. Also they may develop leaks because the alcohol could soak through.
153483,cranks bait,2008-01-23 14:33:00,721,I think I have narrowed it down.  I have an '83  two stoke so I do need a separator.  I ran it last year for about 200 hours so I don't need a separator.
153486,icefisherman,2008-01-23 15:04:00,952,"  Sinker, two things pop into my mind after reading your comments. 1) My motor is fuel inhection so since it is new and my mechanic hasn't worked on it yet maybe he is telling me not to install a filter because he is assuming it is ""pre-mix"" and it is not as oil gets mixed with gas inside the engine not in the tank. 2) The more I think about this issue I wonder - maybe one of the resons (among others) for seizing my 60HP 2 Stroke Johnson last September is NOT using water separator....  It was ""premix"" motor.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
153488,Bernie,2008-01-23 15:06:00,3190, LOL. I hear you Cranks.  I would like to be able to copy and paste the entire bulletin on here but cannot due to copy write but if I read it thoroughly and understand it the same way I will be able to possibly pass on the finer points.  icefisherman. The most common reason for engine failure is lack of or poor lubrication or lean fuel mixture.
153497,Bernie,2008-01-23 16:03:00,3190,A couple more notes Alcohol can increase the possibility of vapor lock. This can make it difficult for your fuel pump to pick up and continue to supply fuel. Fuel under pressure reduces vapor lock.  Also in an Evinrude bulletin they are saying a test kit is available from Briggs & Stratton suppliers for checking alcohol content in fuel.   Part # 100023 and is $5.45 US. It is available on-line at briggsandstratton.com
153526,Tybo,2008-01-23 18:01:00,1373,Do not use high octane fuel in your pre mix if you don't plan to use the hole tank that day. High octane fuel has large amounts of detergents in it that will back down the oil.  Most diaphragm fuel pumps do not have enough CFM's to pull the fuel through a water separator. making the engine run lean.  Older engines fuel lines should changed to ethanol rated lines.  Gas has a shell life of about 6 weeks.
153587,Fisherman,2008-01-23 21:18:00,7201,"After reading this, got a little nervous about using the 10% ethanol in my Honda. Checked the owners manual(1996), it already allowed for use up to 10% ethanol in the gas with no worry.  One less headache."
153591,ecmilley,2008-01-23 21:30:00,2163,"I don't use a seperator on anything i currently own, but it can't hurt to put one on. The one thing i do do is add isopropal based gas line antifrezze to everything every couple of tanks as iso will bond with water and remove it from the system summer or winter, for storage can't really beat yamaha fuel stabilzer it's 100% hydrocarbon based. on the other hand not sure how much iso alcohol will effect a 2-strokers a/f ratio causing a lean issue."
153592,icefisherman,2008-01-23 21:32:00,952,"More info on this subject....just got home after stopping at a Shell gas station on Hwy 401 and Trafalgar Rd. - the GOOD news is they don't sell ANY gas that has ethanol....so 87, 89, 91 ALL are ethanol FREE!!! Super news to me as this gas station often is on my way to the fishing spots on lake Erie and Lake O. so I'll start filling up there all the time. Manager was there and said no plans to go on ethanol any time soon. This makes me thing marines must have access to same ethanol free gas as well.  News number 2 for the day:  Spoke to a good marine today in Oakville....the chief mechanic told me no problems with water separator/fuel filter from Racor and my two motors. But he said there is a trick to it to ensure problem free flow of fuel to either motor. The order is like this:  Fuel tank.....fuel hose.....primer ball.....fuel filter/water separator.....either motor....  In other words....the primer ball MUST be BEFORE the water separator...this way squizing the ball few times fills up the fuel filter with gas and starting the motors and running them after that is no problem at all. He sais he has installed many such filters and had never had problems with starving the motor. He was actually trying to sell me a Mec filter for about $50...but I went and bought the Racor today...also got spare replacement element....so should be all set now....the Racor filter and the ethanol free Shell gas should resolve this issue once and for ever.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
153259,icefisherman,2008-01-22 21:44:00,952,"Well, I've just called and spoke to The Shell Headquarters in Calgary. They told me (very kindly) their stations in ON, SK, MB are required to have up to 10% ethanol ""average"" BUT....speaking of Ontario they confirmed that in the GTA area ALL their stations selling 87 octane gas will have up to 10% ethanol in it. The 89 grade will have up to 5% and the 91 grade will NOT have any ethanol.  Now......OUTSIDE of the GTA most (if not all) of their stations will not have ethanol in any of the grades of gas (for now but this will slowly change in time). They also told me if I have particular area/town and call them they can tell me if their stations in that area sell gas with ethanol or not. They also told me they get this question asked DAILY, so seems like we are not the only ones interested in it.  Then I called Esso as their web site states: Ethanol-blended gasoline Ethanol-blended gasoline is currently available at participating Esso service stations in Saskatchewan and Ontario.  Stations selling ethanol-blended gasoline have a label on the pump indicating the gasoline may contain up to 10% ethanol.  I knew there is a reason why I hate Esso...didn't get much help from them....the lady said ""noone can tell me what stations have ethanol and what don't""....or well....what can I say....  Seems like there is decent chance with Shell to find 87 gas with no ethanol so I'll be checking ahead of time what Shell stations on my way to the fishing spot sell 87 gas without ethanol.  Thought this may give you more into.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
153269,2 tone z71,2008-01-22 22:14:00,1311,"any engine run off a boat with a built in tank should be seperated,Wayne the Etecs come with the on board seperators as well NA NA NA NA"
153271,Bernie,2008-01-22 22:23:00,3190,Mercury does NOT want additional filters or separators added to their systems.
153286,irishfield,2008-01-22 22:42:00,26272, Yah... but you can't hear yours seperating the water/fuel over your engine ! LOL  Bernie.. probably for good reason and I'm giving the idea second thoughts. Asking a LOT of that 9.9 kickers fuel pump to suck fuel up out of the hull tank..thru all the connections and then a restricting filter to boot.
153290,Bernie,2008-01-22 22:51:00,3190,"Yes Wayne. I agree. 2 strokes can be damaged easily by lean fuel mixtures. We see it especially in snowmobiles. I believe the reason being is snowmobiles are stored through summer conditions where heat and high humidity evaporate the fuel more readily than the water. Deposits then form on the main jets causing lean fuel air ratios consequently causing burned pistons. I think the problem is more evident on larger engines where larger amounts of fuel requirements can be restricted by additional filters and separators. What is confusing me is the fact that some other manufacturers are recommending them. Thats what I'm trying to figure out now. There may be some differences with the 4 VS. 2 stroke as well. Still looking, will let you all know what, if anything, something new comes up."
153299,icefisherman,2008-01-22 23:10:00,952,"To add to it - I spoke to number of Suzuki dealers last two days....Canadian and US ones. They ALL said they ""strongly encourage ALL their customers to install fuel filter/water separator"" Two of them (in the US) went so far to say - they refuse servicing Suzuki outboards that don't install such filter. I guess that stands on its own! I've tried to confirm this with Suzuki directly but letâ€™s just say their customer service can use some improvement, so I wasn't able to talk to the right person. But I did talk to Racor - the manufacturer of the best fuel filters/water separators out there...and they are the ones making the filter for Suzuki...they did say the filter I was considering WILL SUPPLY ENOUGH fuel for both motors. Suzuki lists that filter under Suzuki part number and they recommend using it on motors with up to 140HP. There is larger filter for the larger motors. My 115 Suzuki is rated for 18 GPH and I am sure my Yamaha 9.9 4 stroke kicker is much less than that, so the filter they recommended is rated at 30 GPH and they say it should be plenty to supply enough fuel to both engines and will NOT starve them.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
153341,didoban,2008-01-23 01:03:00,65,go for a water/fuel separator. Its' a good cheap investment...especially for those boaters that do not use a lot of fuel during the season or those that keep less than full tank will collect condensation.  I have a vmax with a see- thru separator and at different times during the season I get water in the separator.
153416,Sinker,2008-01-23 05:15:00,8692,"My marine mechanic told me to stay away from the filters. Same thing, starving the engine.  I just make sure my gas doesn't sit around very long.  How long does it take to separate? That's the question we need answered......and I'm sure there are prolly a million variables to the answer.  I haven't had a prob, and I'm burning gas with 10% ethanol.....or so they say.......I just add 2 oz. of stabil to each tank and give er' ..........I mix it in the tank myself.....50:1 mix. A tank doesn't last me more than a week.....after that, I take it out and burn it in the lawn mower  Sinker"
153425,SlowPoke,2008-01-23 08:52:00,2984,My Mariner should be fine. The foam doesn't have a chance to settle before I use it all.
153433,Landlocked,2008-01-23 11:24:00,171,So does this apply to 260hp I/O engines?
153447,Sinker,2008-01-23 13:07:00,8692,  Mine is a Mariner as well. Mechanic told me not to worry about it.....just drive er' like always  Sinker
