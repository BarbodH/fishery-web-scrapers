153506,chickenhawk,2008-01-23 16:36:00,612,have to go with either white or chartreuse
153566,Kirk,2008-01-23 20:42:00,347,"yellows my favorite go to color, white is #2 unless I am fishing over rocky bottoms, then I use red/brown or whatever crayfish color there is in my box (I have nice Phoenix grubs in a crayfish finish)"
153436,Roy,2008-01-23 11:56:00,13728,"Aside from using dark or bright jig heads, I don't worry too much about colour at all. To me, the size (weight) of the jig is more important. I'm partial to hair jigs and use those almost exclusively....I'll sometimes tip them with worm, minnow or leech if the fishing is slow. The really important thing to me is the presentation...VERTICAL, VERTICAL, VERTICAL keeping control of the bait on the drop."
