153573,Casey123,2008-01-23 20:57:00,461,"Anyways, just wondering if this could have waiteduntil March 15 when the huts have to be off????????????????????????????????"
153711,Kerry,2008-01-24 01:00:00,383,It would be nice if they could but there is so much water still backed up in the system throughout our area they have to let it out.If we had the same thaw starting today with what is now on the ground again here after the last few days it would likely be worse than the recent flood up in Huntsville in many areas throughout our region.Letting some water out may help keep the slush to a minimum under the snow too.

153718,Terry,2008-01-24 01:10:00,14456,"yeah the answer is no way can they wait the lakes are close to max levels if they wait till the spring runoff starts to they to lower the levels, it's too late  maga property damage flooding everywhere, some old guy making a large wooden boat animals showing up..not good"
153727,AzuluSpookd,2008-01-24 01:21:00,348,Too bad they couldn't drain in directly in G Bay....we could use it
153731,Lostchild,2008-01-24 01:33:00,153,"I hear Orillia/Barrie area has something like 90cm (almost 3ft) of snow on the ground now and more coming.  That is alot more water come spring or the next thaw, good on them for acting now before it is too late."
153781,waterwolf,2008-01-24 02:58:00,556,the january thaw is a blessing in some areas like the grand river water shed which desperately needed some water . at present they're talking about reopening belwood guelph and have reopened shades mill for fishing . good news for southern guys.
