153922,irishfield,2008-01-24 20:49:00,26272,Anybody know who sells these things locally in the GTA area? Would be great for all my trolling spoons as I am getting way too many plastic trays of them.    
153924,Uncle Buck,2008-01-24 20:59:00,1000,oh oh...  Wayne's got the trolling bug now...  they usually have the spoon boxes at the fishing show... might wanna try there

153926,SlowPoke,2008-01-24 21:05:00,2984,"I know where to get Special Mate boxes. Does it have to be the Maxi-Mate?  If these are okay, I can pick one up for you. -Brian"
153931,irishfield,2008-01-24 21:15:00,26272,"They look the same Brian, thanks. I'm in no rush... got my eye on 126 spoons in a FREE    box first... and then I'll need another for what I've already got ! LOL"

153954,fishdawg,2008-01-24 23:05:00,912,"can be ordered from the Lake Michigan Angler site, but yes Jos should be able to get 'em in for you - there is the regular spoon sized box & the magnum."

153979,brickNblock,2008-01-25 00:18:00,598,"Wayne......Gagnon's does have them but a very poor selection and quantity of. QuinteOutdoors Sports has them for sure in quantity and selection. I believe their web site to be just that: QuinteOutdoorSports.com or similar. They may have a mail order system in tact, not sure of that. Pete"
