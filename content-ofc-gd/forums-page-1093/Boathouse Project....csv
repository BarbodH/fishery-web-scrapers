Still left to do is the electrical, insulating and finishing of the interior.  I really like the idea of those rod holders, I'll probably be adding something like that for sure Pigeontroller.  The next step is going to be finding a suitable tow vehicle (Pickup 4x4 V8) and then of course ordering the boat!  I'm very pleased so far!  Tony"

Consider Skylites, sounds silly but when I built my garage 3 years ago I put 2 in I got from Home Depot, they were about $300 each...At the time I questioned the idea, but after they were in I realized how nice it is to have some natural light!
