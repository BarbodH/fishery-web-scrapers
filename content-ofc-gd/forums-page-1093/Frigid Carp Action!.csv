152273,Rich,2008-01-20 00:06:00,3927,"Well today I proved my theory that carp feed actively all winter. -10 outside plus whatever windchill was and I still managed to go 2/3 on the carp. They are still hitting canned corn on bottom. The secret is getting the bait right to them. They won't move far to hit, but they still fight just as good as in the summer. Lots of fun and I will definitely be back for more as winter progresses. Anyone who's not a fan of ice fishing get out there for winter carp action on the rivers it's a blast!      "
152276,shane,2008-01-20 00:49:00,652,Good for you getting out and catching some fish.    It may be better than ice-fishing but it's still too cold for me.
152278,crappieperchhunter,2008-01-20 00:52:00,2582,Thx for sharin Rich. I love the carpin...but won't be chasing any until the end of May. But it's nice to see someone out after em.

152288,douG,2008-01-20 02:27:00,2693,"Attaboy, BBRich!  Thanks for showing how it's done."
152289,Victor,2008-01-20 02:38:00,1609,Good to see some carp report during this time of the year!
152309,skeeter,2008-01-20 04:29:00,1907,"See --you learn something new every day! sure would be nice to get one of those on 4LB test while ice fishing.lol will they fit thru an 8"" hole? lol i've heard they fight like heck ( of course i've only heard that)    Dann"
152347,b2kptbo,2008-01-20 12:48:00,1505,"Good one Rich, ya look a little chilly..."
152350,motv8tr,2008-01-20 13:00:00,2587,"Good stuff...Hey Beans, you paying attention???  Maureen"
152365,Beans,2008-01-20 14:43:00,3339,"Sure am Reen...problem is...our lakes are closed for fishing until the end of April...just as well as they are covered with ice...  Nicely done there Rich...as much as I envy you your carpfishing, I don't think I'm ready to freeze my butt off...-20*C this morning...getting a bit old for winter fishing..."
152698,ccmtcanada,2008-01-21 14:46:00,7971,Great work Rich!!  You're having a great winter season this year.  Good on you for gettin out there in the frigid temps too!
152786,Minnow,2008-01-21 18:31:00,177,Nice Carp Rich! Seems like the late January carp bite is hot! I didn't even know you could catch carp in the winter!
152794,Mike Pike,2008-01-21 18:58:00,1332,Good stuff Rich.  You've uncovered a whole new winter sport.  I was one of those who thought you couldn't catch carp in the winter.  Very encouraging for those of us who like targeting 'em.
153020,dsn,2008-01-22 08:04:00,1018,Nice carp. But I must add it looks like its been starving. So skinny. There are no rivers near by where I am so everything is frozen over.  dsn
153133,Rich,2008-01-22 16:12:00,3927,"Yea DSN most have been very skinny out of that spot since early December. I think the only food source they have is crayfish and the french fries people feed to the ducks. lol Not so much feeding going on however they are probably getting their fill of corn from me. I've dumped a ton in that spot for chum.  Funny I said ""never too cold"" because the next day it indeed got too cold.    The upper part of the creek froze right over (rarely happens!) which cut flow off significantly to the lower area of the creek where I do the majority of my carp fishing. I still gave it a shot and had a short tussle with a little guy but most of the carp had moved deeper and closer to the dam.    Talk about a flash freeze!"
153322,Crazyhook,2008-01-22 23:56:00,1154,Dude thats Bad ass!!!! wish I would of stuck it out... they stopped for me in Oactober..
153510,mattyk,2008-01-23 16:45:00,2110,you are a champ! Thanks for sharing some cold weather carp fishing with us.
