153546,Bernie,2008-01-23 19:30:00,3190,Just went for a ride on an E-tec.......................................Skidoo.  Just tried out some new technology today. Was very smooth and quiet. Was wondering why they haven't done it before this.
153548,ecmilley,2008-01-23 19:38:00,2163,"cause it's new, brp has been trying to perfect it for the last few years in outboards. brp-bring rods and pistons"
153550,Bernie,2008-01-23 19:42:00,3190,We haven't experienced that type of problem here ec...Not trying to create a slam session here. Just interesting stuff is all.
153551,Gerritt,2008-01-23 19:43:00,6129,I bet that thing would be a hoot to ride!  G
153554,Bernie,2008-01-23 19:48:00,3190,Maybe if I'm a real good boy we can give it a try in February  Gerritt. Yahoo
153556,Gerritt,2008-01-23 19:53:00,6129,  Better start saying please and thank you at every opportunity Bernie! LOL  I can hear the Russians calling my name BTW  LOL!  G
153561,Roy,2008-01-23 20:13:00,13728,"They calling you ""Black"" ones, Gerritt?"
153563,Gerritt,2008-01-23 20:15:00,6129,  How'd ya know?  G
153568,irishfield,2008-01-23 20:49:00,26272,Is there a guard around the propellor Bernie?    and does it work better in fluffy snow or hard packed?
153574,ecmilley,2008-01-23 20:59:00,2163,"no it's intresting technology that's for sure, but brp has had all kinds of issues with longevity in the outboards with engine failures, and even there snowmoble sdi systems were prone to crank failures (with a constant stream of oil/fuel to cool the bearings) but this di 600 mill is the same basic engine as the sdi in that it doesn't have liquid cooled cases (that cool's the bottom end) so it'll rely on oil for keeping the crank alive. don't know if the di system is to blame for e-tec problems or quality issue's from brp but mercury and yamaha's direct injection systems are near bulletproof in the outboards. Now is ski-doo can get these to market with minimal problems and solve some quality issues , then offer it in a 450 lb 1000cc sled I'll buy it"
153600,Bernie,2008-01-23 22:05:00,3190,Wayne.  I'll let you know. We haven't much snow here right now. Only buzzed it around the field a couple times. Feels pretty good. Not sure if we are using as a demonstrator or not. Haven't had time to ask Mark. All 9 guys in the shop took it for a trip around the field and were very impressed.
