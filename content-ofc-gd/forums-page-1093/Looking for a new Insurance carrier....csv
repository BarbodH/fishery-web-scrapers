Turn out they were just bought out my Desjardins... Desjardins is a Visa Broker, Rona Card etc etc etc financial company.... I hate this EVIL Quebec Firm.. Constantly plastered with mailings from them or telemarketing for their financial products.... I truly despise them   So now to find out I will be paying $$ to a company I love to hate I m not happy.  Seeing as how they changed I highly doubt I should be required to pay a break-fee either.. I was not consulted nor asked if I wanted to change insurance companies. I refuse to do business with this firm. They therefor cannot force me to continue with them.   I am now officially in the market for insurance. For my house, two vehicles and boat.  Landlocked, Steve.. have a moment to spare?  Anyone else happy with their rate and the service provided?  Thanks!  G"
