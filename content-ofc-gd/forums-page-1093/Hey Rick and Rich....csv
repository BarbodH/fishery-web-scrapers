154082,Rich Clemens,2008-01-25 12:14:00,3131,"Hey Mo ... Appreciate you asking.    I'll let Nikita show her appreciation to you in June.  My girl just had her two week check-up last night and had her stitches removed.   The surgeon said her incision has healed up very well.   Just two weeks after the surgery, the vet said she is walking very well on the leg and really putting some weight on it.  Still limps a little, but that is to be expected.   We have been very careful with her these last two weeks - keeping her penned up in the downstairs of the house.  She really fought that cone she had to wear so I spent the last two weeks sleeping on the living room floor.  This allowed her extra time without that cone - at least someone got a good night's sleep.  We have to keep her from running and jumping for at least another month when we go back for another set of X-rays and we'll go from there.  We're allowed to take her on 5 to 10 minute walks, so that will be good to get her strengthened up.  So far, everything is going very well.  Hey Rick:  I was thinking of Jack on the way home last night from the VET.   Got an update for us ?.  I know Jack is a little further along, following the same kind of surgery.  Hope all is going well with Jack as well."

Once he had healed somewhat the best thing that we did for him was Hydrotherapy. Ask your vet if there is a canine or equine pool near to you. Ben was nine at the time and his recovery has been terrific. It is something that also helps aging dogs to remain mobile in their remaining years...  John..."
