154017,LebowSKI,2008-01-25 02:10:00,27,Just wondering if anyone has been out to Moira Lake recently and has any information on ice conditions?   Don't feel like swimming on Sunday!  Thanks.

154163,bigbuck,2008-01-25 18:08:00,2449,I've heard stories of some big muskie in Moira lake as well as quite a bit of pike and walleye. Any truth to this?? I've got a buddy with a trailer there and an open invite to go this summer.
