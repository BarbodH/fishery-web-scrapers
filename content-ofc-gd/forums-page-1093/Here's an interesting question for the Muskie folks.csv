153709,GNODDY,2008-01-24 00:53:00,163,How do you know which reg to follow with a tiger Muskie as them being a Hybrid. DO they fall under Pike or Muskie Regs.  Someone had asked me this the other day and I didnt have an answer.   Cheers  Geoff

153712,GNODDY,2008-01-24 01:02:00,163,Thats what I thought too but I wasn't sureand figure someone here will have the Scientific answer

154009,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-25 01:58:00,0,That's like asking what regs you follow in regards to pickerel or walleye.  
154013,Terry,2008-01-25 02:05:00,14456,"I looked in the new regs..there are no size limit or daily limit on pickerel, so I think you can keep all you want....  but there is on walleye  LOL"
154016,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-25 02:09:00,0,Oh man. Yer the type of OMNR we need more of.
