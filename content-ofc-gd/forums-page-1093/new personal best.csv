153796,setomonkey,2008-01-24 03:54:00,872," There isn't anything like it in the world. Everyone tells me not that it goes by too quickly, but I can't wait to get him his first rod (he got a toy plastic one this Christmas) and start teaching him how to fish.  Mike"
153845,snag,2008-01-24 14:37:00,1932,Being a Dad is great!  We are just starting to get normal sleep again.  Funny thing happened the other day. The garbage collector refused to take our garbage because the diapers caused the container to weigh a ton.  Congrats!

151189,setomonkey,2008-01-16 01:08:00,872,"Hi guys,  Been quiet for the past few months as I have been really busy with work and with taking care of my son, our first, who we've named Oliver.    He already got his first (toy) fishing rod at Christmas, and he seems to like watching fishing shows with his dad. I think he's a bass guy because he doesn't seem too interested if the show's about other species, but if smallies or largemouth are getting caught, he starts paying attention.  Can't wait until I can get him out for some panfish off the cottage dock.  Looking forward to catching up on OFC and making some posts once in a while.  Happy belated new year to all,  Mike"
