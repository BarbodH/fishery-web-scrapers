148707,ccmtcanada,2008-01-07 13:59:00,7971,"Great thread Steve!  Here are a few of my pics....  Kawartha opener with my daughter...no fish in this pic, but it shows what fishing with family is all about....spending time together.....   In late December 2006, I decided to try my luck at float fishing for Steelhead.  After about 10 times out with no fish, it took the teachings of CanadianCopper to finally break my steelie skunk.  It's not big, but it was my first of many to land last year.  It was -18C (-25 with the wind chill), but we persevered!!   Our first ever trout opener...on a nice, small, out of the way trib.  Not huge numbers of fish, but no crowds!!  Here's a few nice shots....     Lakair was a highlight for bly and I...here are a few pics....   The group shot....   Basskicker gave us a canoe this past summer and we had a great time finally getting off the shorelines!  It's not often you can get a 5 year old to stay seated in a canoe, but she did great....here's a pic of her first fish from our canoe...   The fall came and bly and I went after Salmon for the first time ever.  She ended up catching this gorgeous Brown Trout....   Here's Bly's PB Salmon...what a monster!!! (The fish...not bly....LOL)   Here's my PB Salmon...man these fish are strong!!!   My second ever Muskie and my PB.....   Solopaddler took me Steelhead fishing this past fall, and WOW...the scenery and fishing was great!  Here's one of my favourite shots....  One of Bly's nicest fall walleye...from one of our secret shore spots....  A nice Walleye for me as well....my PB by length came in a 33.5 inches.   To top it all off...bly and I bought our first boat together....cant wait til spring!! "
148714,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-07 14:11:00,1362,"This is a GREAT thread!!!...I love seeing all these pics...here's some of my 2007 memories to share with you all...  This was my PB Brookie caught in April   My son came up to visit me on Father's Day and we spent the afternoon huntin' a couple of Muskies     Here's a few pics of our annual trip up North to a buddies camp! 10 days of being in heaven  My buddies camp and me pulling the bush ""buggy"" to get into some remote trout lakes    We took off on the bikes from the camp to go huntin' for some Brookies...here's a shot of my buddy wanting to be first on the trail   Crossing the river on the bikes   The first ""pit stop"" of many on the way back to the camp   A few fatties that day  A nice bow caught on my buddies lake    The color of meat on these rainbows were something else!!   A ""mountain"" trout caught on my buddies lake and a GOOD sunburn on my legs   Nice shot of the lake  A few more muskie pics     My PB Muskie caught Thanksgiving weekend   We took advantage of Indian Summer Oct 22nd and biked into a small remote rainbow lake for a couple of days..     My PB walleye caught Nov 28th on Quinte   Another Quinte eye caught that morning..   I sure HOPE 2008 is just as good!!!!!...bring on the soft water"

She would not hold any fish yet but we are working on that. My best picture is my (2) best fishing Buds  "
148883,Mike the Pike,2008-01-08 01:26:00,3421,Now if only these 2 would stop smoochin while ice fishing and I know they could contribute more to the Hard water reports

154106,Seaweed,2008-01-25 13:40:00,135,Here are three of my most favoritie fishing shots of 2007.  My opening day of Bass season musky   My last Bass outing of the year... sweet   My most favorite shot... my Grandson with his first Largie.... I'm proud of him  for sure. 
148582,Greencoachdog,2008-01-06 23:42:00,8163," A nice January ""Spot"", betcha y'all wish you could go Bassin in January eh?  A gang of hoodlums at the Lakair G2G!  Me and some guy that washed my windshield for 50 cents at Lakair.  Two derelicts I picked up hitchhiking that volunteered to clean the Pike Tourney fish for shots of Granny's ""medicine"".  My first ever shore lunch!!!  Nipissing fish... the littlest first.  A Perch with an attitude problem  My PB Wall-ice to date, that I used to for...  bait to catch my PB Nip Mucksie!!! (I like to gaff and release all my fish!)  Other fish  A nice Striped Bass I caught while fishing in Czechoslovakia, the structure to my left (your right) is the Iron curtain. I didn't think it looked like that either... but it does!  Yes! They have Spotted Bass in Czechoslovakia too!   This is a world record Silver Peacock Bass I caught while on fishin' safari on the Amazon River! Yes!, that is the Amazon rain forrest in the background there.  They also have Blue Catfish there too!  .. and Striped Bass too!   Fished Lake Simcoe and got this world record Smallie in my left hand (your right) and world record Gobie in the other! Brian (Bcanuck) can vouch for me if y'all don't believe it.  Simcoe is just full of these huge Gobies!  Also got this Bowfin and MERMAID!!! while fishin' Simcoe!  Another shot of the Bowfin, the Mermaid got away... I knew I shoulda put her on the stringer!!!   I caught this on the BOQ in November.    I went back to the Amazon and caught these 2 Killer Pirahna, had to pull their bottom teeth so I could do the ""Lip"" hold.. if anyone ever tells you it doesn't get cold in the Amazon, tell them they're full of green jello!!!  I hope y'all enjoyed these pics... and weren't expecting to hear the truth from a fishermans lips!"
