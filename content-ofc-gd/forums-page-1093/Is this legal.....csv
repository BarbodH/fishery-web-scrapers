153428,Greencoachdog,2008-01-23 10:48:00,8163,"I posted that vid here a couple weeks ago.  Down here in 'Bama I think it would be considered more like jug fishin', which would make it legal for non-gamefish like Catfish, Carp, and Gar... but not for gamefish. You could have a fleet of them if you wanted.  They are trying to outlaw them in some states, because they're using them in the Tailrace waters of some dams that don't allow boats with people in them to take their lines way out further than one could cast. They want to outlaw them because they're very effective and some people are taking the big spawners with them."
153429,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-01-23 11:09:00,1362," Another way of getting to the area that you want to get to is by using a sling shot...place your lure on the band, pull back and let go....oh ya..forgot to mention..don't hang on to the treble hooks"
153431,Greencoachdog,2008-01-23 11:18:00,8163,  We just cast down here in 'Bama...
153442,Big Cliff,2008-01-23 12:48:00,6899,"legal or not, it sure looked like they were having a blast LOL. Now those are the kind of kids that don't have to worry about drugs to get high! if I was a CO and saw them doing that I'd probably congratulate them for thinking something like that up then look the other way in a big hurry! (well, I might kind of keep watching for a bit.... There is nothing nicer than seeing kids use their brains to have some good fun."

153696,FishHeadRic,2008-01-24 00:33:00,226,I found something like this on the net from Australia. It would drag your lure out into the surf until a fish would bite it but then the lure would release from a clip and then leave you to battle it with a rod. Great idea but I'm sure any of the surf guys down here on LI would really frown upon the practice.  FHR
153770,bbog,2008-01-24 02:15:00,665,"Pretty cool, looked like the fish was going to take the boat under - gotta work the gearing just right to maximize the drama. Like others have said - the kids could be doing worse."
153871,wheelin_ca,2008-01-24 17:54:00,2,"if you tied a line to the bow of the boat, then it would be like using a float...  a self propelled float....hmm   ideas forming"

153205,Roy,2008-01-22 19:51:00,13728,Not legal Bubba.   Busy are ya? I guess you're doing research now eh?
153211,TJQ,2008-01-22 20:00:00,7806,research.... ya...
153212,danbo,2008-01-22 20:02:00,2646,"Good one, Boss!"
153213,ccmtcanada,2008-01-22 20:06:00,7971,I saw this last week...pretty cool if you ask me!!
153217,Kirk,2008-01-22 20:17:00,347,"looks illegal as my guess, fun and would like to try, but illegal.  I recall something in the regs about using rod reel etc, but to be sure, research would be needed.  if nothing directly on point, it would be in the grey area of legal but 'is it ethical', which we have lots of experts here. LOL"
153218,CLofchik,2008-01-22 20:18:00,854,100% legal                         If that's their own private pond with no moving water access
153220,Rich,2008-01-22 20:20:00,3927,"lol, been there, done that (on a friend's private pond with no moving water access of course)"
153224,Joey,2008-01-22 20:32:00,9122,"That was on an episode of Patent Bending.  They did it and televised it, why isn't it legal?  Joey"
153235,lovetofish,2008-01-22 20:56:00,500,"pretty funny, none the less!   lovetofish"
153242,irishfield,2008-01-22 21:08:00,26272,Only one line behind the boat... don't see an issue! Considering the number of people involved they could have had a much better line spread I'd think!
153260,Hookset,2008-01-22 21:53:00,367,"Man I've always wanted to try that.  My guess is that it's legal. As long as the little dude in the boat has a license   . ...and doesn't have an open beer.  But, in todays world, if it's a lotta fun, it's probably illegal.   Hookset."
153265,carp-starter,2008-01-22 22:02:00,253,"I think that it is not legal – the “You Tube boat” method.  I believe that in Ontario it is not legal to fish with a “motorized” rod and reel. There are some being used here and I think that there is a fellow in Kingston who can make one for you. The motorized “rod and reel” used in Ontario are being used by the disabled and the “old” who are the only people who get approval to using one.  However, there are ways of getting around the restriction in using a toy boat for fishing.  In the You Tube video, the boat is used as a rod and reel and this is not legal.  In shore fishing, many times the fish is way beyond the maximum distance that you are able to cast. All you have to do is to place your lure on the boat and then motor out to where the fish are. Once you reach the required spot, you simply yank the lure off the boat and then you just reel in the normal way – hoping that the fish will go after your lure. All of this is legal.  Another way of getting to the area that you want to get to is by using a kite. This is good in fresh water in Ontario but is it very good on the beach when you surf fish. In surf fishing, usually the most important thing is to be able to cast to maximum distance.  If you are fishing at the mouth of a river that has a strong current going out, you can also use a piece of board onto which you put your lure on and have the board taken out by the current. When you get where you want to, again, you yank the lure off and reel in. This technique is best at the mouth of a river on an out going tide in the ocean.  The above 3 techniques are used only to get your lure out to maximum distance. They are not used in the hooking a fish as in the You Tube.  carp-starter"
153268,Terry,2008-01-22 22:13:00,14456,yeah  illegal the way they are doing it but if you used the boat like a planer board .have a release clip and had line cliped on the boat and running to your rod and reel I would say you are good to go
153293,Riparian,2008-01-22 22:57:00,269,In patent pending all the boat did was pull the lure out real far and drop it. As long as the line is still connected to a rod and reel I think its totally legal.
153295,Mark Kulik,2008-01-22 23:05:00,348,Kids having a good time! legal or not they could be doing worse! cool vid.
153312,Bernie,2008-01-22 23:36:00,3190,That was my thought too Mark.
153328,camillj,2008-01-23 00:15:00,1988,There always at least one pooper at a party .. I say totally cool and legal ! .... Now try that up in waynes world and some 58 incher will EAT THE BOAT
153333,Fang,2008-01-23 00:31:00,1330,right from the regs  Angling Angling means fishing with a line to which one to four hooks are attached and that is held in the hand or closely attended.  I'd say that would be classed as closely attended  and motorized reels for handicapped are allowed without any permit requirements
153338,irishfield,2008-01-23 00:42:00,26272,As far as I'm concerned it's more attended than say a tip up 100 feet way.
153358,liquidsniper,2008-01-23 01:53:00,11,"Legal or not, lets say a large fish takes the lure, over powers the little motor that boat has on it, and drags it down.  The boat stops working, can't retireve it.  Is that fish supposed to swim around with it???  More than likely the fish will die because of it, no????  I'm all for fishing and taking the limit and all that sebazz, I love to fish and take home my catch to eat.  But in this case I think it's unfair at what could happen, I know fish die all the time yada yada yada, but why add another one???  We're supposed to conserve right???  Alright I'm ready for rebuttles."
153367,camillj,2008-01-23 02:04:00,1988,Actually .. think of it this way .. when your rod is on the rigger and in a holder whats the difference (except of course you are IN the boat while trolling .... BTW wayne looking at your avatar made me think POWER-TROLL from the plane
153369,irishfield,2008-01-23 02:08:00,26272,I did try trolling this year while taxiing to the leeward end on a couple of back lakes. Gonna have to make up another pursuit track and holder for that I guess! Speed's pretty good for muskie. LOL
