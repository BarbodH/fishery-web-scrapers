If anyone has not been up to the park at the end of April or early May, I highly recomend it.  Last spring we saw 7 moose along 60, the year before we saw over 20...not to mention the foxes, porcupines etc.  Anyways I degress,  The small lakes usually have ice on them still, leavingthe larger, deeper lakes the only ones open for early season lake trout.  Many lakesare either HP restricrted or no outboors period.  So last year we saw something so funny I almost lost control of the car and crashed   I will get the nae of the lake but it is on the south side of 60 at km 27 if you are heading from west to East, there were about 15 boats and motors, 3 of the boats were so close together you could walk across them, and  there were two older gentlmen, obviously were arguing, started to slap at each other with boat oars......  You couldn't pay for this type of entertainment, hence the reason we fish outside the park.   I would love to hit some of the interior lakes in te north part of the park, I bet I wouldn't have Larry, Curly and Moe to entertain me though! "

Funny though, I've always found that it's the smaller, shallower lakes that break up first, not the bigger ones.. Last spring I fished Lavielle in early May and caught a ton of fish. Been fishing the interior for well over 25 years now. Best fishing has generally been in the smaller ""dead end"" bush bash lakes that aren't part of any route."
