I mean, almost need to wear a gas mask to tie the spawn sacs!  The smell is worse than the worst used babies daiper!  To quote ""Anchorman""....""it smells like bigfoot's dick"". Hahaha  I don't like to keep mature females, just for eggs, so I buy my spawn.  I'd prefer to only keep one or two small fish per year.  I like to buy in bulk, and sometimes it doesn't last too long.  Also, some store's curing process smells odd too(too chemically, too cured, etc).   I don't think these smells are much of a concern.....but how about that really funky, nasty, smell they get when they're past their due?  I wish I had more time to test my stinky spawn this past winter and thaw we just had!  Maybe I'll still be using the stinky stuff in the spring, though."

That doesnt mean it wont catch fish! but I would say your lowering your chances of catching fish.I have far more success with good roe. If my roe is crap I would rather use worms! never much liked store cured roe, (or store roe for that matter)buy it uncured and treat it yourself.  Ryan"
