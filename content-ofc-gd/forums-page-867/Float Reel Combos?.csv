But, is there ever such a thing as a FLOAT ROD/REEL COMBO?  If they exist, where have you seen them before?  It'd be nice if they had 'em - but I guess because its very 'low' in popularity... is why no major company has 'em? or does it? It'd certainly be good for beginners? don't you agree?  Just a thought for you guys/gals to wonder? Cause I'd REALLY like to know if anyone's ever seen such a combo exist?  RoB"
329160,denisk,2009-04-12 12:44:00,163,Raven had a matrix combo and right now I have a sweet kingpin combo with either a 11'6 or 13 matched with your choice of kingpins.  You can combo up any thing you'd like really I almost forget that okuma puts out a combo to.   Shop around you will find exactly what your looking for.
