328470,Fishmaster,2009-04-10 04:17:00,920,We got the boat in the water today... all went well with a great night of fishing.  We went 9 for 12        We fished from about 6pm till 11pm and caught all of our fish on cut bait and large emeral shinners.  On the way back in we were marking fish all over the place...
