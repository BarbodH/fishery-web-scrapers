Bacon and toast that is. Looked like I was staying for a week with all the gear I brought. Stove, BBQ, kettle, coffee perk, etc. We met up with a few guys there not from the board but hopefully soon. I caught the first fish of the day. I'm like yeah, my first cat. Then it came out of the water and I'm like yeah, my first carp. 28 inches 11lb 2oz. Pretty cool.      Later on Jose hooked into a cat 26inches 6lb 15oz    No more fish for us two the rest of the day. Two of the other guys beside us caught one each. 10lber and 11lber. All 3 cats were kept by them for the smoker.  We had a great day, sorry yours got cut short Jose. Will definatly do that again. I still need to get my first cat.  Curt"
