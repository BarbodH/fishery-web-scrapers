328166,Jay T,2009-04-09 11:48:00,282,"I agree with sinker, your shot is definitely blown I would try taking a couple without your choke on at 20-30 yards and see how your pattern is. You should not have to take a bird at 40 yards +, if you do you should work on your calling more or get better set up in the field. I shoot a 3"" mag side by side and all ways smack them down. I have never had to shoot a turkey past 20 yards, put your scouting in and set up properly."

328301,misfish,2009-04-09 19:26:00,29133,"Thats awesome wiggler.  TFS   40 yards would be my max,but getting the bird closer would be the right move."
328305,richyb,2009-04-09 20:25:00,774,I went and got a new choke today. truglo gobble stopper extreme model tg175x  .665 dia. The package says its for my gun but just my luck it dont fit. It screwes in about 1 turn then it gets realy tight. Tried a wrench on it but that just got it stuck. . I put my old choke back in and went for round #2. put up a 4x4 chunk of paper and fired a couple shots . ( different paper each time)  my tightest grouping is just under my point of aim but its still only got 90 pellets in a 10 inch circle. So now I have a sore shoulder and im not too impressed with the new choke not fitting
328317,BassAsin,2009-04-09 21:05:00,806,your lucky your old fit in after trying to wrench in the newer one!  have you tried shooting it without a choke at all to see the results?
328323,richyb,2009-04-09 21:23:00,774,"  I have tried it with my normal full choke that came with the gun. The pattern wasnt very good. If you think im lucky to get my choke to fit after wrenching on he other one , id hate to try putting a choke tube in after not having any choke in at all. Would that not tear the threads right out ? also im trying to tighten in a pattern , not make it wide open."
328340,bassjnkie,2009-04-09 21:47:00,1101,"I really wouldn't want to shoot without a choke, it's a pain to re-thread. For the turkey choke, check out Bass Pro, or Epps in Orillia, but call first. The pattern you have isn't the worse I've seen considering it's at 40 yards with a full choke, BUT it could improve with a proper turkey choke. H.S. and Primos make nice ones.  40 yards is a great starting point to shoot, at least if the tom isn't interested, your confident enough to take it at 40. Like others said, calling is the most important, if you can get the bird at 20 yard, the pattern you have will shrink considerably. I shoot a Benelli supernova with Primos Jelly Head choke and Win. 3 1/2"" #4, compared to the full choke it's like night and day.  This is the choke me and my dad use, we tried 3 and this one worked best on my Benelli and dad's Beretta.  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...__SearchResults  If you can find it for your model, which they probably make, you won't regret it. But, H.S. are less expensive.  Hope this helps."
328344,bassjnkie,2009-04-09 21:59:00,1101,"Just to add. The p350, as it says on the company site comes with a XFT extended extra full turkey choke. Did you buy the gun used?  Check the link:  http://www.stoegerindustries.com/firearms/...r_p350_pump.php"
328346,richyb,2009-04-09 22:08:00,774,No i bought the gun new but it was missing the turkey choke so i got a discount. Those pictures of my pattern are with a carlson .650 turkey choke.
328394,Sinker,2009-04-10 00:36:00,8692,"Have you tried it at 20 yds? 30? I'd also use smaller shells. I find 3.5's blow on me with waterfowl loads, so I don't use them. Never tried them in lead......no need.  3"" shells are more than enough to kill anything......dead is dead.  Patterning at 40 yds is fine, but if you plan on shooting your bird closer, you might want to see what its doing at those ranges as well. If your center of pattern is below where you aiming at 40yds, it could be much lower at 20-30 yds. You might want to look into that. Make sure your looking down the barrel the same way each shot......that will make a difference on where your shot goes. Sounds like your gun doesn't fit very well. I can look at a target, close my eyes, point my gun, and its dead on target. No messing around......it just goes where I look.  PS, you shoulda got an 870!!!  Sinker"
328403,misfish,2009-04-10 00:52:00,29133," Ya,but yer a newf. I too, can aim,close my eyes and hit the target."
328407,ch312,2009-04-10 00:59:00,1590," both you and your friends have not yet found choke/load combo's for 40 yard turkey shooters. you want to have tighter and more even patterns than that. the top pattern is the best overall, not the bottom. the other 2 patterns are not even and are full of holes which is exactly what you dont want with a shotgun.  you'll also need to take 3 shots with each choke and load combination and take the average # of hits in the kill zone.  btw...the head in your pics are about the size of a turkeys but the necks are much longer."
328410,ch312,2009-04-10 01:05:00,1590,i just did some more reading...you really need to buy a rangefinder or practice range estimation if you thought 75 yards was 50. that is extremely unethical hunting and you were 100% lucky you got that bird.
328537,richyb,2009-04-10 15:17:00,774,"  It was my first year hunting turkeys and i never knew how big those buggers actually are. When i first seen him i thought it was a bear coming out of the bush. Rookie mistake, i know better now. I killed him so i guess it wasnt luck   just kidding.    YES SINKER i should have got the 870. I went to ellwood epps to get the 870 but they were sold out and i had my heart set on buying a gun that night. When they said i could get a gun for cheaper thats full camo i couldnt resist. Stoeger is made by binelli, beretta. It has the internal parts of the nova, just cheaper materials on the outside. PLUS i know how to shoot a gun, ive been hunting for 15 years and have many kills with no wounded animals to my credit. ( no big game, maybe the odd duck or partridge) so my gun goes where i look too. The only problem i have is this stupid turkey patterning that is plenty good enough to knock a bird down at 40 yards but isnt up to the standards that i would like.   So i think i am giving up on the situation since my shoulder is tender, and my cheek is sore. Also i wandered into a golf store and baught a nice new titleist wedge that set me back a few pennies   PS. the main reason i was looking to tighten up my pattern was to keep less pellets out of the body of the bird, 30 some hits in the head and neck is plenty when it only takes 1 to kill it.  Thanks guys."
328591,ch312,2009-04-10 19:54:00,1590,"richy, those patterns are NOT good enough at 40 yards to be reliable. just because you had a lucky pellet or two with that long shot doesnt mean these blown patterns are acceptable. having the mentality that 1 pellet is all thats needed isnt the one you should have. have some respect for the birds and stick to 30-35 yards max until you find a better choke/load combo. my gun shoots tighter patterns than those with a full choke and normal shells so you clearly havent found the right combo yet.  when it comes to patterning you dont count how many pellets hit the bird, you count how many hit the vitals (spine and skull). you want an average of at least 8-10 pellets hitting the vitals which is why its important to use actual turkey targets until its easy to judge patterns.  some guns can be a real pain to find the best choke/load combo but its definitely worth it being able to have faith in your shot. you should also consider mounting a scope or red dot on your shotgun because its very common for the center of the pattern to be off.  you asked for some advice from experienced people, but it doesnt seem like you are willing to listen...   PS...you need to work on your form if you have a sore shoulder and cheek"
328710,misfish,2009-04-11 01:54:00,29133," If you get a pellet in the body, man that would be amazing at 40 yards.There are to many layers of feathers.Just like goose hunting. I aim for the head when thier flying in,then wait for them to fly by and shoot.The pellets will enter easier, going UNDER,into the layers of feathers.   YEP"
328890,richyb,2009-04-11 17:08:00,774,
329022,ch312,2009-04-11 23:31:00,1590," i guess someone cant take a little criticism? we arent attacking you so theres no need to get so defensive  those pellets falling when you picked up the bird were stopped by feathers. hard to believe something so light can stop lead or steel eh? i guess you musta threw shot at those birds too  if you have the money to buy all your other gear, tags, etc then you can afford a few more boxes of shells. if you actually have 10 people in your group, each person only needs to buy 1 box. trade shells with each other giving every one of you 10 different shells to try. youd be amazed how great the proper choke/load will shoot. what shoots great in your gun might be the worst in another gun...  you dont think im man enough to shoot 3 1/2"" shells? dude, give me a break. i shoot quite a few 3 1/2"" #4 buck through a full choke every year at coyotes and they kick harder than any turkey load.  yes, having a sore shoulder and cheek is the direct result of the shooter having bad form. there are many things that contribute to this and can usually be cured by having someone watch you while you are shooting. how do you think people manage to shoot the big bore rifles (577 t rex as an example  ) without killing their bodies?   totally pointless trying to teach a know it all something"
329043,Northhunter,2009-04-12 00:27:00,214," A 3 1/2"" load is a 3 1/2"" load. The recoil is dependant on shot charge and velocity. It doesn't matter what it's loaded with. If #4 buck is hitting your shoulder harder than the same load of #5 bird shot at the same velocity than it's all in your head.  You can have excellent form and still take some punishment. The heavy 3 1/2"" candlesticks will produce 60-70lbs of free recoil. I'm 205lbs and anything over 40 starts to punch pretty good. Why do you think there is so much emphasis on recoil dampers on newer guns? Butt pads, special gas operated dampers, overbored barrels, ""kickoff"" systems, etc., etc. The big bore rifles are not meant for high volume shooting. Most use open sights. They are designed to make the 1st shot count. The .577 ""T-rex"" isn't even a hunting rifle. It's a personal defence round designed by safari hunters for when the hunting rifle doesn't do the job on dangerous game. It's a big mother-f#$*!n' backup gun for when the crap hits the fan and you need to knock an elephant on it's ass   Bruised shoulder or not, you don't fire that thing 'til you have to."
329047,Zebco,2009-04-12 00:37:00,123, Whats that saying about glass houses again?
328003,richyb,2009-04-08 23:50:00,774,"Today I dug out my turkey choke and grabbed the 3 types of shells I have and headed to where I sight in my guns. My cheek is still a bit on the tender side    . The number in the bottom right of the pics indicates the number of neck and head hits. The target was at 40 yards. winchester #5  3 1/2""  winchester #4 3 1/2""  Kent ultimate diamond shot #5 3 1/2""   To me  the kent has the best pattern but it is hitting low. Since I was aiming at the black dot I know that if I put the bead on the top of the big gobblers head its going to be nighty night.  I fired 2 of the kents and both targets look similar in shot grouping.  Anyone else have some pattern pics ?"
328008,misfish,2009-04-08 23:57:00,29133,"I dont mean to sound negitive,but thats brutal.  40 yards, you should be right on the head better then that,IMO.  I,ll be out this weekend ,and will post my shots Rich."
328014,richyb,2009-04-09 00:11:00,774,  Thats why I was posting to see peoples opinions. All of the other guys I hunt with are shooting 2 3/4 with modified or full chokes that get maybe 5 in the head and neck at 40. That paper is just printer paper and a turkeys head is bigger than what I put on there. Im sure if I was a turkey 30 shots to the head and neck wouldnt make me a happy camper.
328016,misfish,2009-04-09 00:15:00,29133,"I use a turkey choke aswell.Have tried using the full and modified,but there is no comparison to the turkey choke."

328048,BassAsin,2009-04-09 01:05:00,806,"what size of shot were you using richy? 3"" 3 1/2   ? i know at 40yds with 2 3/4"" plain jane full choke i'm hittin close to 40 pellets in a ""kill zone""  that seems like a big pattern if your shooting 3 or 3.5 inch shells with a good choke."
328049,BassAsin,2009-04-09 01:08:00,806,when you try for one with the bow richy are you going to be using a broadhead or one of them lob the head off kinda blade heads?
328059,richyb,2009-04-09 01:26:00,774,"  Aw crap i forgot to put in what size shells lol all 3 1/2 inch. winchester 4, and 5 and kent ultimate diamond number 5 . I might use the guillotine with my bow, a guy at the camp baught a pack but then figured out he couldnt use them with his x bow unless he kept taking off his foot sturrip after he loads it."
328061,BassAsin,2009-04-09 01:30:00,806,"ok so especially for 3 1/2 i would say thats a pretty crappy pattern. it could be the choke or the shot maybe a few things, gonna have to keep shootin, at 40 with a good choke and 3 1/2 you should be puttin 50+ in a kill area."
328080,richyb,2009-04-09 01:53:00,774,"I was doin some reading and thy say a good turkey gun is one that will put 100 pellets in a 10 inch circle at 40 yards.  Maybe ill try a shot at the circle and see how many I can get. Would the .650 be too tight and be giving my shot too much compression and making it spray a bit? most of the reading ive been doin people are using .665 or .670.  The guys at the camp think im crazy wanting to hit a turkey with so much lead. They are happy putting 5 in the head and neck at 40, but I want some serious blood when I pull the trigger lol"
328089,BassAsin,2009-04-09 02:07:00,806,"do you have any other chokes at your disposal you can put to the test?  100 in a pie plate at 40 yds means my gun sucks! but it has dropped birds at 45 gotta ask, does it really take  100 pellets?"
328096,richyb,2009-04-09 02:23:00,774,"  Nah it doesnt take 100 pellets , only 1 , I have dropped birds at 75 with this gun ( first year judging distance, thought it was 50)    But id like to get it shooting as good as possible. I am very currious to see pics of other peoples patterns to compare. I have a full choke that came with the gun but I tried it last year and I was only averaging 15 in the head an neck, thats why I got the turkey choke.  Cant wait to see others pics. Most of the pics I can find online arent much better than the results I have unless they have scopes, expensive shells, and expensive chokes."
328100,BassAsin,2009-04-09 02:35:00,806,thats a long shot/lucky shot. hahah   i'd show some but havnt shot at a target other than clays in a few years!
328105,Ramble,2009-04-09 02:55:00,713,"The 10 inch circle allows to find the best pattern. Your not only looking for 100 in teh circle but a fairly consistant pattern as well.....not blotchy. If you can get it to pattern with AT LEAST 100 then you know you can kill your bird at 40.  I don't have much 1st hand experiance but i do understand a good portion of the theory behind patterning. I think you are going to have to play with your chokes 1st off. Get the 10 inch circle and try  the full choke and then the turkey choke about 3 times each and see how many are in the circle. WHich one is better? Might give you a clue to what is happening with your shot when it leaves the gun.  If you are consistantly getting low numbers in teh circle try the heavy shot and see what happens. All the variations of heavy shot pattern a little different so u have some play in the selection. The upside to heavier shot is that even if you have fewer pellets hitting the target then you want, each pellet is carrying more energy and therfore does more damage then lead of the same size. You can also consider going down a size or 2 in size with heavy shot. It'll give you more pellets but still retain enough energy to drop a bird.  You're gonna have to play and experiment to see what works.  If you are still having trouble it's a good excuse to go gun shopping lol.  Good Luck.  -Dave"
328124,Sinker,2009-04-09 03:37:00,8692,"By the looks of your pics, I'd say your pattern is blown. In other words, the shot is so tight that the pellets are actually crossing each other, and your left with a hole in the middle of your pattern. Hard to describe.  I shoot 3"" Kent #5 diamond shot 90% of the time. The key is getting them close. There is no need for 40yd shots at turkeys.....if they're coming, let them get close. The heavy shot is crazy, but not really needed......unless  your taking crack shots at over 40 yds at turkeys......which you shouldn't.  I'll take some pics of my pattern once I get out to pattern it. Maybe this weekend.  I'm just shooting a remington extra full choke. I tried the turkey chokes and I found my Xfull was better.  Every gun will shoot different. Take two guns that are identical, and they will pattern differently. You have to shoot a lot of shells, out of lots of chokes to find what works best.  I find the best way to kill anything with a shotgun is to work them close......then shoot thier face off! Try aiming a little lower on your target too.........I aim for the base of the neck. If your aiming too high, half of  your pattern is going to go over the bird. I'd rather have the center of the target on the neck, and all the rest of the shot above and below center still hitting the bird.  Sinker"
