327193,Silo Buster,2009-04-06 21:42:00,81,Farm fleet flyer    Just thought I'd put this add on here for anyone looking for a radio that is portable for the boat.  Looks like a decent idea...     Not sure how to expand the page.Its the one that says tractor tunes.
327197,Silo Buster,2009-04-06 21:49:00,81,hhhmmm  now the linky dont work  farmfleet.com is the link and there's a waterproof radio that has quite a few interesting options on it.  Go in into the flyer and its on a page close to the back.
327199,GeorgeJ,2009-04-06 21:50:00,207,"I'd like some tunes on my boat and was considering a construction style radio, they are water resistant and durable have handles so you can strap them down. Not to mention they are portable and can be used anywhere."
327201,misfish,2009-04-06 21:51:00,29133,"TJ RULES, WITH TUNES ON THE BOAT."
327212,2 tone z71,2009-04-06 22:07:00,1311,I thought so to untill I brought one of my Dewalt job site radios out no signal scratchy reception at best
327214,GeorgeJ,2009-04-06 22:16:00,207,"  mmm.... thanks for the head's up, Makita makes one too wonder if they are any better..."
327222,brkygetr,2009-04-06 22:29:00,425,"Sony makes a marine cd player and speakers...my buddies got one in his boat...it ROCKS...literally...and relitivley cheap, $300 for the entire package. It's awesome driftin for walleye under a beauty sky with the tunes just cranked and not another boat for miles!"
327227,2 tone z71,2009-04-06 22:40:00,1311,"Sirius with the portable boombox is what I use now,Ive also got a sweet Clarion Marine Cd deck with a set of 7 inch Alpines that I love and am keeping for the next boat"
327230,jediangler,2009-04-06 22:43:00,1923,"I like my ipod shuffle. Perfect sound and only good tunes. I feel no need to impose my musical tastes on other boaters. Of course I only wear it at ""no gas motors"" lakes."
327417,BUSTER,2009-04-07 10:24:00,1336,"sirius boom box here also, runs on 4 'D' batteries and works better on the lake with no houses or trees to block the signal!"
327429,paul_614,2009-04-07 11:44:00,168,"On my first boat I used an Alpine car stereo that I pulled outta my car. I don't fish in wet weather, so waterproof was not an issue. I just mounted it under the rear bench seat, and pulled it out when done playing."
327449,mbac31,2009-04-07 13:00:00,904,I have that Sony Marine Stereo as well. Great system. Not sure the cost but has stood the test of time for sure. Poundings out east in the ocean and great lakes poundings. Nice calm day drifting around with some nice tunes and knowone around is awesome for sure. Bass Pro sells a few very cheap with all speakers and connections as well. Some are under $200 for sure.
327720,walleyejigger,2009-04-08 00:30:00,876,"i now use a sirius boombox, carry a few garbage bags in my tackle box incase it starts to rain, i used to use the dewalt jobsite radio, but as said reception sucked so i used to hook up my mp3 player to it"
328718,droopdude,2009-04-11 02:20:00,10,I use one of these.    http://www.atlanticego.com/
