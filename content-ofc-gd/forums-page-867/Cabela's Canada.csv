328961,Golfisher,2009-04-11 21:23:00,586,"Hi guys,  I've been out of loop for a while and this question might have come up before, but are prices shown in cabelas.ca CDN or US dollar? Also, do you still get hit with duties?  Thanks a bunch."
328989,grt1,2009-04-11 22:21:00,638,if you order from the cabela's.ca web site at the 800 number listed I believe the product comes from winnipeg and the prices are canadian dollars.
329000,xeon,2009-04-11 22:38:00,350,"Its basically the old SIR mail order and like grt1 said, its from Winnipeg in CAD with no duties."
329002,Cudz,2009-04-11 22:41:00,2652,Correct. THose are CDN prices and there is no duty.  Cabela's opens in Winnipeg first.  Kind of weirdish.
329024,Golfisher,2009-04-11 23:39:00,586,"Great, thanks a lot for the replies!"
329048,desship,2009-04-12 00:45:00,96,Just ordered their guide Tent. No duties and no provincial sales tax.Good deal and received within a week.Need snow to melt to set it up.
329054,xeon,2009-04-12 00:54:00,350," Because thats where SIR mail order use to be before it was bought out by Cabelas.  Even if there was a Cabelas in Toronto, I think bass pro would continue to keep most of the average joe market."
329072,TrippyJai,2009-04-12 01:40:00,28,"I think Cabelas would be great in Ontario, but I think BPS has the best location. Person I would love to have another selection to go to. BPS never have the things I want. Most of the time, I order online."
329078,Garry2Rs,2009-04-12 02:06:00,1425,"When I'm in the States I order more items on-line from Cabela's than BPS. BPS has tons of ""House-brand"" items that are often on sale. Cabela's has house brand items too, but they seem to have name brands on sale more often. Both store operate in Phoenix Arizona, and a trip to the big city, for me, means a visit to both stores...grin."
329086,Cudz,2009-04-12 02:18:00,2652,They need to open a Cabela's in Barrie; right beside my house.
329152,FLEX ROD,2009-04-12 12:07:00,394,"Cabela's house brand stuff is a far suppirior product than the BPS, I have some rods from Cabelas that are 30 + years and still goingstrong. How can you argue with Cabela's return policy.  If Cabelas had opened up here insted of BPS at the same  location I know that the wife would have had me either evicted from the house or had Cabelas evict me     .  FLEX"
329154,Radnine,2009-04-12 12:16:00,1538,Based on this thread I have just checked out the Cabela's Canada web site. There is more selection in the general store/gas station in Emsdale. Holy doodle man! Did they promote the janitor to web master or what? It looks like a half  'ed effort at best. We deserve better than to be thrown a bone with so little meat. Go Le Baron!! Jim
329156,ColdH20guy,2009-04-12 12:33:00,312,I didnt think it was too bad of a selection.....if only they would move east!
329180,Radnine,2009-04-12 14:09:00,1538,"I am talking about being compared to their US website in both quality and quantity. If you think that the Canadian site is not too bad, check out the US one. You'll wet your pants. Jim"
329323,xeon,2009-04-12 21:52:00,350,"They are just starting to put the site together, they have to inventory every single item, get pictures and prices and have someone put it all online. Its not an overnight project."
329324,Raf,2009-04-12 22:04:00,3495,i motion to replace bps with cabelas in vaughan..  i've been to several locations in the states for both retailers and cabelas is head & shoulders above bass pro.
