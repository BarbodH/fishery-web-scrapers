328914,Billy Bob,2009-04-11 19:07:00,5865,"Could someone here explain what it cost to own a firearm in Canada. I have heard so many stories I don't know what to believe. Someone told me it cost $250 for each firearm. That sounds way too much. So what is the cost for a firearm license and firearm registered.  We are always getting hammered here in the US to take away our 2nd Amendment but so far all attempts have failed. But then again they keep passing more an more laws to limit the use of firearms here. But here's what really gets me. They have PLENTY of firearm laws on the books when when they finally arrest someone violating the law they don't prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law. Just look at our Buffalo Bills running back Marshawn Lynch. He got caught in Kalifornia with possession of a illegal firearm. They lowered the FELONY office to a misdemeanor and basically let him off. The same thing probably will haven to Plaxico Burress from the NY Giants. He shot himself (FUNNY) in the leg at a NY City Night Club where they have a MANDATORY 3 year jail term for violating the law. The gun was once registered in Florida but that expired. He WOULD NOT get a permit in the NY City area. Even my pistol permit in invalid in NY City. He is still walking around among us while his lawyers get the charges reduced.  But anyways please answer my above questions on cost.  Thanks, Bob"

You would think that getting a gun license would be difficult for someone who is mentally ill but there are privacy laws. My brother who was a schizophrenic before he committed suicide(not with a gun) had no problem getting a gun license and it was only during the waiting period that through the extraordinary efforts of my mother, that he never got the license. He would have been dangerous with a handgun. Not that he would kill someone with evil intent, rather that he was so delusional who knows what he would have done."

Wonder how many more lives that would have saved versus the zero that the gun registry has. We have had to register handguns since the 30's, has that done anything to stop violence with handguns, no."
328987,Cookslav,2009-04-11 22:08:00,1457," Actually...I'd say no I don't think its important. I'd say its Nieve and dangerous.  The responding officer should respond to a call the same regardless of fire arms being registered to the subject or not... Assuming their subject has no firearms simply because he's not in the registry is a potentially deadly assumption. I would say the safest bet is not to make any assumptions, but treat each case seriously, and not jump to conclusions.  Also, Just for the record... What does the registry have to do with helping police Identify potential gun owners? Could they not simply look at the license data base?....yup they could and it would accomplish the very same result. Although I'd still have to say assuming that I'm more dangerous then someone who does not ""APPEAR"" to have fire arms simply because I do have legally registered firearms is incredibly stupid, and dangerous...not to mention insulting.  All that registry does is vilify firearms owners. It doesn't aid police, it makes them vulnerable if they rely on it as a tool, and further more, its not working... Its simply a massive drain on our Tax system that could potentially be going into out health care, school system, or better yet...into our police force. That money is 10X better spent on increasing our forces.  You wanna cut crime down? Put more boys and girls in blue out on the street..."
328990,Cookslav,2009-04-11 22:22:00,1457," By the way... For the record I'm currently in that same boat. I'm glad your mother did what she did to stop him, and I think thats the duty we face as family &  freinds in that sort of situation. My bro is ill(diagnosed psycotic/depression) , and has his license, and obtained it before he was ill, but.... The registry hasn't brought the police to his door demanding his firearms, nor does he even have a police record indicating he is ill. The registry isn't going to stop him or anyone from getting a firearm if they are determined...be it leagally or not.  I hate to sound like a broken record, but Guns don't kill people....people do. If he had intent, not getting his hands on a firearm is hardly going to stop him from acting out what ever delusion exsists. Sad, but very true"
328994,xeon,2009-04-11 22:32:00,350,"I think police would be more worried about someones previous criminal history than the type of firearms they own. I'd be more concerned responding to a call that involved someone who doesnt have a firearms licence and could have unregistered firearms but has an extensive criminal history, compared to the guy who is part of his local shooting range and owns a handgun and has all his guns registered.  I personally dont want to be in the situation where im visited by police with them having their guns drawn because I own firearms and they assumed im a risk to society. Just saying.  But really, the party who abolishes the gun registry (conservatives probably) will not get voted in again for a while because they are making a visible effort to decrease overal safety that can be targeted by the liberals. Its not gonna happen, live with the registry, if you dont commit the crime you have nothing to fear.  Can this thread be locked and removed?  And theres MUCH bigger wastes of tax money."
329021,blarg,2009-04-11 23:26:00,289,"  So, despite the fact that the registry does nothing to prevent crime it increases overall safety?  Well thats logical.  ""if you dont commit the crime you have nothing to fear.""  Except of course the eventual confiscation of your firearms and the demise of sport hunting.  Might be ok with most liberal city dwellers, but then what the heck do they know about anything outside of the city?"
329052,xeon,2009-04-12 00:49:00,350," I guess it was kinda trickey to understand so Ill reword it for you. The liberals will target the conservatives in voting campains because they see the abolishing of the gun registry as a decrease in overal public safety, hence the reason why it was brought in in the first place. Or dont you think the liberals will use that against the conservitive party if hand gun crime throughout the projects of Toronto keeps increasing?  The gun registry and semi-auto bans are two different issues."
329055,scuro2,2009-04-12 00:55:00,904,"I saw this on a t-shirt. Guns don't kill people...they just make the bullets go a heck of a lot faster!!   The correlation between the amount of guns in a province and the death rate from guns is very robust.  http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/informa...sur-son-eng.htm *The registry was used by police 3.5 million times last year. *78% of trained police officers use it in their day to day functions. *81% use it in responding to service calls. *73% of trained police officers state the registry influences the way in which they handle a call. *81% of trained officers say it has been beneficial during major operations.  Looks like you folks have been duped and are swallowing the NRA propaganda whole. The data base is being used in a major way, and most police officers see it as a useful tool. I'd respond to all the other comments because I disagree with most of them, but there are too many."
329061,xeon,2009-04-12 01:07:00,350,"NRA isnt in Canada btw so you cant use that one.  I personally say leave it aswell but streamline the costs. Give up trying to win, because trust me, usually anyone who owns guns is very strong on their personal beliefs.   Now is the guns in province:gun murders in province corelation based on development, population, registered firearms, un-registered firearms, stolen firearms, illegal firearms, prohibitid firearms or what? Theres allot of factors making that statistic."
329066,Terry,2009-04-12 01:20:00,14456,and the number one fact the gun registry has not prevented even one violent crime oh and did not stop one criminal from buying a illegal gun that they wanted to commit a crime with  but it cost lots for honest gun owners and is a pain in the butt  it's time has come and gone..a waste of money from  the get go

329112,Northhunter,2009-04-12 03:56:00,214," If the registry actually lead to preventing a crime I'm sure we'd hear all about it... seems the ones for it will say whatever they can to try and justify the $2,000,000,000 dollar price tag.  It's common to hear that enforcement accesses the database X number of times a day/year - what they don't tell you is the number is generated by routine traffic stops as the database gets a hit everytime.  I like the old ""If it saves just one life it will all be worth it"" bullcrap. It's yet to do that, but the money spent effectively elsewhere could save many, many, many lives in a year."
329137,scuro2,2009-04-12 10:38:00,904," Remember these facts? *73% of trained police officers state the registry influences the way in which they handle a call. *81% of trained officers say it has been beneficial during major operations.  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/a...illed-shooting/ Back to the US example where three policemen were murdered on a domestic call. What was that all about? Apparently a pet had peed on the carpet. The killer who murdered the police officers, ambushed the first two police officers at the door by shooting them in the head. Had they known that he owned several weapons I'm sure a lot more caution would be used. The killer believed that President Obama was going to take away his rights and his guns. He owned an AK-47 rifle and several powerful handguns, including a .357 Magnum. Now do you folks honestly believe that such information wouldn't be useful to a cop coming to a domestic disturbance call, and could have prevented the death of police officer? And do you also really believe that a similar situation hasn't happened already in Canada? Ideology to the max!!!"

I know bad guys don't register guns but they do steal them from honest folks who maybe will now take just a little extra care to secure them.

Yes ,we have nothing to hide,but it,s a CASH COW. IT,S A CROCK   This is all Im going to say, as it IS a very sensitive subject."
328714,Black_Blade,2009-04-11 02:08:00,258,"In all the news stories concerning a gun related crime, very rarely do you hear in the reporting of it, whether the gun was registered or not.  But that brings another question to mind...even if the police recover a rifle used in a crime that they can trace back to its legal owner..which has been stolen from him/her.  What real good does that do?  The gun got stolen from the owner, was used in the commission of a crime and the weapon was recovered, so now the police can go back to the owner of it and let them know their weapon has been recovered.  Wow"
328716,tschirk,2009-04-11 02:18:00,261,"The trick is to catch the stolen gun before it's used in a crime.

This is just my humble opinion, and I do respect your counter opinion. Thx, Ted"
328720,jace,2009-04-11 02:27:00,472,"  Somebody who has a chance to steal a gun will take it whether it's registered or not.   A person who stores guns properly or not has nothing to do with the gun being identifiable in a database.  A piece of paper telling you who owns it has nothing to do with finding it any more than knowing who owns a car helps find it after it's stolen.    If a gun is stolen and found, it will get back to the owner but it will certainly not influence how quickly it can be found just as knowing a car owner's  name will locate a stolen car any quicker."
328746,Cookslav,2009-04-11 03:38:00,1457," Well, Its not saved a life or even ""helped"" to solve a single documented crime to date since it's inception so...its more or less just been a cash cow, and nuisence to responsible owners and helped to vilify the perception of firearms owners.   The logic behind such a statement is to simply limit or ""tag"" Firearms as a whole in hopes it lowers the amount of stolen firem arms... When in reality a responsible firearms owner would obviously report the theft thus making the registry redundant or a HUGE waste of time. (stolen legal fire arm = illegal firearm..the fact its registered does nothing to help recover it until after the crime is committed)  Its not fair or productive to make us register our firearms, because a few criminals use them in contradiction of the law. Why not ban cars? Cars kill more people then guns...cars are stollen daily. Yes we register our cars...has that limited the deaths caused by cars? Nope.... So I'll pose it this way and leave it at that.  If you want to kill some one....you don't NEED a gun to do it. I mean Zero offence Ted, I think we're just on the opposite side of a fence here."

The weapons of choice for the criminal are hand guns and automatic weapons. They are illegal already and no amount of bureaucratic nonsense will eliminate them.

328847,caper,2009-04-11 13:56:00,210," Wether a gun is registered or not and is stolen really doesn't make much difference. The person in possession of the stolen gun will not have a firearms licence and the gun will be seized and the person charged regardless..Any street rat in possession of a firearm will be dealt with accordingly.  The thing that never gets mentioned is that even though the long gun registry will be gone everybody in possession of long guns will still have to have a firearms licence. The gun owners are registered still which is a good thing in my opinion. The media make out the elimination of the gun registry seem like there will be no checks and balances as to who can have possession of firearms. Those will still be there regardless of the registry.  As far as the police use of the registry, it tells them who has registered firearms. It really doesn't matter how many just that they have access to firearms.  Craig  Oh,  13,362"
328854,jace,2009-04-11 14:19:00,472,"  that's always been part of my argument also.   thugs who carry illegal guns on the streets don't want our 40""  hunting rifles that weigh 15 pounds.   Even a sawn-off  rifle/shotgun would be 3-4 times the size of a typical pistol or revolver.   And in my lifetime, handguns have always been ""restricted"" firearms, harder to get, and have never been allow in hunting.   Handguns are only legal for shooting at a ranges here which means most hunters and rural residents  have absolutely no interest in them.   They might as well start registering owners of air conditioners becasue that will be as effective in reducing gun crimes and  illegal guns on the streets.   at least it'll lower the price of wheat in Poland.  ever see the photocopy of a registration certificate for a B&D soldering gun?  hilarious.  I think the application was a joke, but a registration certificate was actually issued."

What are moderators doing posting on a thread like this?  Fact - the majority of police officers think the registry helps them in their job, especially when they can check right in their cruisers if the parties in a domestic dispute own guns.  http://sify.com/news/international/fullstory.php?id=14878802 For instance there is a good probability that the three policemen killed recently in the US would be alive today if the US had a gun registry. They would have known that the eventual killer of the three policemen owned several guns and would have been much more cautious before attempting to enter that house. The gun registry also benefits society in keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill."
328861,jace,2009-04-11 14:33:00,472,"  The way i heard it was it also tells them who owns what and if a crime is committed with a particular caliber rifle, they could check up on people who owned one.   I don't know how long this version of the regulation lasted.   ."
328865,jace,2009-04-11 14:46:00,472,"   1- they should always be ready for a situation with guns because there could be illegal guns anywhere.  Illegal guns can be in any house just as marijuana can be in any house, not just in the residences of people with legal prescriptions for marijuana  2- mentally ill people would not pass the checks made during the Possession OR Acquisition applications.   They could only get the guns illegally, in which case, having them registry is moot."

328879,caper,2009-04-11 16:13:00,210, These are the facts that get distorted by the media. They are not getting rid of firearm licences for individuals. Anybody who owns or has in their possession a firearm still will have to have a firearm licence. It's just the registering of each gun that they are trying to get rid of.  The police will still know that the occupant of a house has a firearm licence and possible has access to firearms.  Also people who have mental health issues should be picked off in the renewal process for their firearm licence.
