329181,dropaline,2009-04-12 14:13:00,20,hey everyone im heading up to Sudbury for school in early september and was thinking about bring up some of my fishing gear. but i was just wondering if there was any good fishing in the city or is easy to get to by taking a bus because i am going to be at Cambrian without a car. does anyone have any advice on the area????
329230,BUSTER,2009-04-12 16:30:00,1336,"yes , yes and yes  bring your gear and buy some new gear to try out on one of the 300 lakes that are larger than 10 hecters within the sudbury region and many many many more smaller lakes.. i just got back to guelph this morn from a wk-end up there and i cant wait till may long wk-end to go back and hit the water!   feel free to send me a PM for any more info..  cheers"
329231,BUSTER,2009-04-12 16:31:00,1336,oh and polish up your drinking skills you'll need that for cambrian college thru a sudbury winter!
329235,getdnet,2009-04-12 16:41:00,2,"I use to live in Lively,just outside of Suds. Ramsey has Smallies, pike and walleye. The point just north of (I think its called) Sunset beach is good. Lots of lakes but the bus system sucks for getting around. Tackle shop in the south end at the "" four corners "" Ramakos is good and people are nice and helpful.  Also if you got access to wheels and a boat there are lots of spots, I can even get you on to some ""Blue Pickies"" and 2to 3lb speckies. Good luck!"
329260,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-12 18:14:00,2050,"fish everywhere brother - spekies, catfish, panfish, smallmouth and pike are all a short bus ride (and some walking) away from cabrian college.  I know 1 pond in particular that should still be loaded with smallies, panfish and trout not far from the school.  Shoot me a PM when you have time and i'll point you in the right direction.  cheers, UF"
