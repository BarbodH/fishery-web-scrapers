329396,Fang,2009-04-13 00:52:00,1330,I thought it was the little wooden canoe guy from a canadian documentary. Kid leaves a little wooden carved toy (canoe + paddler) in the snow up on Lake Superior and when the snow melts it washes into the lake and all the way out the St Lawrence. Spent the last hour trying to find the name of that documentary from when I was a wee lad.
329397,irishfield,2009-04-13 00:53:00,26272,Paddle to the Sea...  Film was directed by Mason.
329400,Fang,2009-04-13 01:01:00,1330,Just found it Wayne and watched it on You Tube. I felt 12 years old again in the library at public school.
