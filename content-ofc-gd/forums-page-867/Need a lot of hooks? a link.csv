328140,gone_fishin,2009-04-09 06:15:00,481,"i wish i could find my favourite gamakatsu hooks in bulk... from somewhere that will actually ship to canada... i'm stuck buying them in packages of 12... and at $7 a pop, it would be a small fortune to replace all my hooks."
328142,Guest skeeter99,2009-04-09 07:18:00,0,  12 for $7 that is cheap   the ones I use are 5 for $6.95  buggers put 5 in package  so you have to buy 2 packs so you can do 2 or 3 baits
328143,OhioFisherman,2009-04-09 07:58:00,6623,"Some of the pricing on the single packs is stiff for some hooks, especially when your getting 5 in a pack. My buddy ordered jig hooks through these people after I made him a copy of the flyer they sent me some years ago. Tough to buy in 1000 quantities though unless you can get a few people that fish hard to do it.  We would order the Mustad 32746BLN about 75 bucks per K with shipping and taxes, about  half what it was costing us buying them buy the hundred.  The Gammie 604`s here sell for 32-35 bucks a hundred? and there isn`t many places near here that stock them, usually a mail order deal too. Just a bit more than half price when you buy a thousand. Not many people use that many though.  Just a thought, throwing out old stuff in the desk, found some cool rabbit hair jigs I had forgotten about, dude gave me a freebie when I placed a large order for some of his other jigs."
328203,Whopper,2009-04-09 13:56:00,2174,Paul can you fill another tackle bag to go with your tube bait bag so the next time I carry it I'll have even weight distribution
328209,superdad,2009-04-09 14:06:00,353,"Just picked up 400 Mustad Triple Grip hooks from Hagens, the price including the shipping to US address was $78 Cdn, a far cry from 9 hooks for $4.99....  I'm sure Hagens will ship to Canada.  Looking forward to sure fire hookingpower with these babies."
328219,OhioFisherman,2009-04-09 14:40:00,6623," LOL Phil don`t think you could handle two. Didn`t have a clue what you guys had some I packed heavy, a lot of good it did us? You do look great holding them silver bass! Got a couple-3 other bags just don`t need to usually carry that much around.  I knew I was going to be with 3 strong young lads?"
328783,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-11 04:37:00,947,Actually that website is great as a online catalog for all the manufactures of hooks
