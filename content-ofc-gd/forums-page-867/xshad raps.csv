Go to http://www.rapalaworld.com and go to Products -> Lures in the main menu, and then the type of lure you are looking for.  If it's not on there I would suggest contacting Rapala directly to see if it is still being carried, sometimes products get cutoff."

328792,pike slayer,2009-04-11 04:52:00,1177,ya i was gonna say something back but  this is a more of a family site so i'll keep my comments to myself haha. if they did discontinue it that would be weird cause they still make other xraps in that colour still. maybe they are just sold out everywhere cause they are just sooo great
