328579,Out4Trout,2009-04-10 19:18:00,98," Thursday evening, end of a short week - drop my son off at Cadets for 7pm. Softwater season - no bugs - who could ask for anything better than a crappie fest!! I winged over to a local lake for a fish, arrived in my favourite spot at 7:20pm. Nobody else in sight - sweet. First bite @ 7:45pm, a decent slab. 2 more slabs by 9:30pm, then a jumbo perch nailed the jig. 2 more slabs, then another perch, then a largemouth bass... now 10:45pm   SQUAAAAAAAAWK!!! I nearly fell in the lake. A heron had come in without me noticing, and was standing about 10ft from where I was fishing. He must have walked along the shore, then had a good laugh at how he startled me. Things slowed down a bit, but managed one more slab by 11:15p and headed for home.  Filleted the fish this morning - fish fry planned with the family this afternoon. Fresh spring crappie and perch - delightful!!! Some technical details... 8 fow, 4 out of the 6 slabs were taken with a tiny orange jig, with a white Gulp Alive fish fry skewered on the back. 2 out of the 6 and both perch taken with a glow Genz bug - with a white Gulp Alive fish fry skewered on the back  O4T"
