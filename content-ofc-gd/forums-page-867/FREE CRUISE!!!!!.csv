328882,floatman_mike,2009-04-11 16:22:00,14,So who else won a free cruise to the bahamas from the sportmans show? Anyone taking the offer?
328883,caper,2009-04-11 16:26:00,210,I won't fill out anything at those shows anymore. The barrage of phone calls after is unbearable..
328884,Joey,2009-04-11 16:30:00,9122,Ya and the cruise is 3 days and you have to pay for transportation to and from the boat.  Good deal  I learned a long time ago not to fill out those forms either.  Joey
328892,bigugli,2009-04-11 17:16:00,6138,My wife will never learn.  I've had 5 calls for Cranberry Resort so far.
328894,Rich Clemens,2009-04-11 17:35:00,3131,"Those things are all around down here too.  Sports Shows, Shopping Centers ... you name it.   Just about the only contest you can enter with a pretty much guarantted certainty of winning."
328897,StylinCatch,2009-04-11 18:00:00,43,Are ya gonna bring T-Pain with ya ? hahaha.

328921,bigugli,2009-04-11 19:21:00,6138,"Taboo's is real nice and I can get a break there, if i was golfing any more."
328985,Rizzo,2009-04-11 22:04:00,4754,if it sounds to be good to be true it is.

329093,rbaquial,2009-04-12 02:27:00,968,"I once filled out one of those ""Win a Cruise"" forms at previous events... since then, I've learned my lesson and never bothered to ever fill them in again.  Basically what happend - they told me all they need is my 'Credit Card Number' - at 1st, it never occurred to me...but at the time, they told me that they need it for whatever reason (can't remember what reason they gave). So - the sucker I am - I gave my number - As I was talking with one of their reps on the phone - I later found out, they would charge a 'small' amount to my card ONLY when I decide to take the trip (7yr time frame to take my trip/cruise). So of course, I didn't worry......2-3 days later, I find a ABSURD AMOUNT charged to my VISA! what the heck?! I FREEEEAKED!! I called them back, basically gave them a piece of my mind!! OMG! You wouldn't want to be the REP that took my call that day....it later clicked in.. ""If I ""Won"" this trip? why would they ask for a credit card number"".... wow, I was young and naive!! Anyway, since then - I don't even bother.  Actually.....  The only time they might catch my attention - is when one of their gorgeous girls approach me"
329100,TrippyJai,2009-04-12 02:42:00,28,"Never fill out any ""Win a cruise, win a car, win anything, etc"" forms. They are all too good to be true and your information will be sold, thus, you getting spam calls, mails, etc."
329101,shane,2009-04-12 02:45:00,652,I'm saving up all mine for a 30 day cruise.
