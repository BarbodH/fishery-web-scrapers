329082,Lunker777,2009-04-12 02:14:00,866,Hey everyone  Well finally a deal came up I thought was pretty good. So I jumped on it.  It a 14.5ft aluminum with a 18HP Merc on it. The owner prior to the guy I bought it off of did a really POOR job painting the boat and its flaking BAD so Im going to need to re-paint it. He started the motor up while I was there and it fired up first pull ! New prop last year and water pump. Plus a tune up in the fall ! Trailer was also included ! I got the whole package for $1000  Good deal ?  Here are some quick pics of it ! More detail will come tomorrow !  
329083,Cudz,2009-04-12 02:16:00,2652,"looks good.  As long as it doesn't leak too much or sink, you can't go wrong.  Looking at the stickers I would guess the motor is about a 1985."
329085,irishfield,2009-04-12 02:18:00,26272,Move the bow stop forward on the trailer. Boat is way too far back.
329087,Cudz,2009-04-12 02:19:00,2652,Yeah I was thinking the exact same thing too mcuh overhang might not even be able to see lights.
329088,alexmedic,2009-04-12 02:22:00,186,"The way I see it is this year you'll be casting from boat, not from shore...  Can't beat that for $1000.00"
329089,Dutch,2009-04-12 02:23:00,831,"Yeah, move that trailer stem up, the stern of the boat should only over-hang the bunks by at most an inch or two.  Nice looking boat though...good luck with it."
329096,TrippyJai,2009-04-12 02:32:00,28,"Excellent deal. As long as there are no leaks, you can repaint and fix it up. I'm looking to buy a boat soon as well. Hopefully around the 2-3K range."
329098,Handlebarz,2009-04-12 02:39:00,3790,Nice Im glad to here ya found something and there is not much better then to redo the boat your self I know I had a great time each time I did the last boat it sure is great to make her your own.
329102,nancur373,2009-04-12 02:48:00,1211,Nice boat. Get some slime on her in a month.  Curt
329107,Lunker777,2009-04-12 03:17:00,866,Thanks everyone !  Yea moving the bow stop forward was one of the first things on the list. Do you think it would be smart to move the axle of the trailer farther back as well ?  Im pumped to start diving into this thing. I wanna get her in the water and take it for a spin !
329123,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-12 04:47:00,947,"No don't touch anything with the axles. Only other thing is i would go over the wheel bearings and make sure there ok .  Transom looks ok from the pictures provided.  Man the joys of owning a boat lol, people with boats know what i mean"
329127,Cudz,2009-04-12 05:07:00,2652,LOL! Definition of a BOAT:  A hole in the water that you keep throwing money into.

329129,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-12 05:26:00,947, It's funny cause it's true
329131,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-12 05:34:00,270,this may sound irrelevant but always carry a couple spare tires ..just incase of a multiple blowout which I have heard occur!
329134,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-12 07:36:00,947,i usually carry a extra bearing kit and a spare
329136,tknohpy,2009-04-12 09:56:00,162,Yes make sure you grease the bearings on the trailer right away.  I overlooked this when I first got my boat and had to relace the axle on my trailer.
329170,fishboy,2009-04-12 13:34:00,550," once you get the boat moved further up the trailer, take a bathroom scale and set the tongue down on it.  If you're at 100# or so, leave the axle where it is."
329227,kennyman,2009-04-12 16:10:00,737,That's one heck of a deal Lunker. Especially with an 18HP. That should fly !! Nice buy.
329229,getdnet,2009-04-12 16:28:00,2,"Looks like the trailer axle  has bearing buddies, once you have checked the bearing and they are good,just put grease in the buddies before every trip. Apply grease gun to buddy fitting and pump until inner cap comes out and stops,buddy is full. It is spring loaded and will push grease into bearings as you drive.Nice and easy"
329251,Tybo,2009-04-12 17:40:00,1373,  You don't want to over fill the buddies. When the grease and air expands you will blow out the seal. The seal is low pressure. It's press into the back of the hub.  Only pump them up half way. Leave room for expansion.
329281,Lunker777,2009-04-12 19:47:00,866,"So I made it over to take some more detailed pics of the boat . I power washed it to get the flakes of paint off and I also rinsed the inside out to get rid of some of the debris !      This the leaky spot that he patched up ! seems to be holding strong !       The engine looks good... looks like there might be a leak somewhere ??? there seems to be a bit of oil and gunk around the bottom of the power head ? I tried to take a pic as best I could but it doesn't show much. I'm not to worried about it !  The bottom of the plastic is lose, and I don't know how to fix it... I can move it around pretty good and there seems to be a bit of a rubber seal lose around the base ??? dunno what it is ? haha          What would be the best way to get all this crap off.... I think its the glue from the carpet that was in there before... and like rock on there ???? tried a paint scraper and tried some paint thinner and there was no luck... any suggestions ???    Thanks for looking !"
