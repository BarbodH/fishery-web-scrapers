Steve headed out on a charter today and his clients caught the first blue he has seen this year!    Check out the colour change between these two fish!   Steve and his clients caught over 25 fish today, with the wind blowing the boat and the anchor hard to set it made for a cool day on the water.     Thanks to all the people that came by today, it was great to see you and catch up on what everyone has been doing over the winter months.   Happy Easter Weekend Everyone!  Be Safe and Enjoy,  Jen ( Bernadette) and Fishmaster (Steve)"
