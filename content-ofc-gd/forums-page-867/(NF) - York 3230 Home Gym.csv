232605,Moosebunk,2008-07-25 04:28:00,3970,It's not a good system.  Trade it in for a $2000 Parabody.  This coming from Hercules.  Not me.
232708,Rich,2008-07-25 15:33:00,3927,There should have been a set of shorter cables included for the butterfly press. At least there was with mine.
232769,urbanangler1990,2008-07-25 18:27:00,933,"  yeah ive heard, do u know how i can get a shorter cable or shorten it myself?  and how bout  the maxium resistence cable, how do u adjust that, says its max can be 160lbs or so"
232840,addict,2008-07-25 21:20:00,475,free weights are the way to go.been hittin them since winter and have packed on 20plus lbs of muscle.
329038,bogoy,2009-04-12 00:19:00,1,"  I changed all the cables.  I used 1/16'' coated cables instead of the 1/8'' that came with the system.  The 1/16'' is much more flexible and it now works really well.  At first I didn't like it at all and I've noticed that the guy who sold it to me didn't install it properly. By the way, adjusting the cables is very easy.  Just use a 1/8'' sleeve (me it is 3/32'') and make a loop with the cable.  I also thin that it is possible to add weight to it even if they say that we can't.  I will try it if i can find other weights."
329124,Raf,2009-04-12 04:50:00,3495,"trade it for a bench, squat rack, barbell and some weights and dont worry about flyes.  i know that doesnt help but its my best advice."
329130,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-12 05:31:00,270,does it help you catch more fish?
