328696,smokin joe,2009-04-11 01:38:00,226,"Joey that could have helped us!!  Always remember to bring you sign, for the team.  I'll see if I can get my other puter up and post the sign I have.  Other wise you can use any of the others posted in the pics handwritten  We don't have a cat entry yet   Joey I apologize if I came of a little strong but we need some entries"
328700,Joeytier,2009-04-11 01:41:00,3990,I know.  So far I've managed to either make an improper sign or forget it all together for everyone one of my successful trips this year. My apologies.
328705,smokin joe,2009-04-11 01:50:00,226,"No problem man just do what I used to do,  fold one that you know is good and put it in your tackle box or wallet"
328748,e-z-out,2009-04-11 03:45:00,1052,Wiser i didn't even know you were coming down. good to hear you got into some cats.  I did mange to land one but gave it away to a fellow fisherman but not before taking pics for my team i hope to have them up as soon as Curt sends them to me.

328647,smokin joe,2009-04-11 00:01:00,226,"Then I guess I shouldn't  mention Stripers I used to fish for that went for 30+   The lower will hopefully clear soon, not near as much ice on the way home than on the way to work today.  It was mainly in the center of the river and the rainbow so hopefully it will break up"
328673,Joeytier,2009-04-11 00:55:00,3990,"I was out today from around 11 30 to five and only managed two.  Went to Oshawa the night before looking for a sucker and drew a blank, and fishmaster was out by the time I got there."
328674,Joeytier,2009-04-11 00:57:00,3990,This was the biggest of the two that I caught. 
327661,nancur373,2009-04-07 21:53:00,1211,Hey guys. Myself and Alie Goby are heading to Dunnville on Friday. I know some of you are talking about going too. Just want to see if anyone else is going. Maybe we could have a beer together or something. Maybe a mini derby for braggin rights. Hope to have the boat readyt but if not from shore is good too.  Curt
327676,FISHINGNUT,2009-04-07 22:38:00,253,I am already packed just not sure on the boat dont think I will have time to getter ready maybe see you there.
327678,purekgw,2009-04-07 22:40:00,585,im planing on going
327683,nancur373,2009-04-07 22:47:00,1211,I'll probably be wearing an orange coat if the weather is cool. Red ball cap or Habs toque. Camo pants.
327825,outdoor,2009-04-08 09:27:00,19,"I'll be launching at Steve's at daybreak, let's hope it warms up a touch."
327831,nancur373,2009-04-08 10:57:00,1211,Is his baitshop open 24 hours? I need some cut bait.
327842,Gerritt,2009-04-08 12:23:00,6129,I might be in.... but if work calls It is hard to say no to double time...  G
327844,bigugli,2009-04-08 12:26:00,6138,This sounds good. I might be able to get out that way.
327849,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-08 12:50:00,2050,"man I'd so be down with this G2G, the boat is ready and everything - but Ginny's about to pop.  I'm talking the baby could come any time now and it's a 2 hour drive to the hospital in Oakville (don't ask ) from our house.  So the 45min drive back home from Dunnville to pick up a wife who's in labor just isn't isn't in the cards for me this weekend.  Good Luck - I look forward to the reports.  Cheers, UF"
327897,LeXXington,2009-04-08 15:27:00,1928,"  LOL, some people will use any excuse. Good luck with your wife"

327911,Gerritt,2009-04-08 17:29:00,6129,"this may sound stupid..... but I have NEVER fished for cats before... so what do I do... bring my boat anchor and still fish? Hook, meat and lead, I assume due to the currents....  Friday is supposed to be nice... at least I have a chance to catch a tan! LOL...  G"
327923,brifishrgy,2009-04-08 18:18:00,559,  yup .. anchor (bring 2 to stop the wind from swinging back end) or nose first into the reeds ... cast out a chunk of sucker or worms or minnows .. sit back and wait  What time is everyone heading out there ... I might be able to make it  for a couple hours .. meeting at fishmasters??? .. BBQ???? .. pt Maitland???
327935,BassAsin,2009-04-08 19:43:00,806,i'd be wearing 100% camo if your gonna wear a habs toque heheheh     good luck on the kitty cats guys
327961,HTHM,2009-04-08 21:02:00,4082,"I will be there in the afternoon as well, just look for the guy with 4 teenagers with him. Oh, you might be able to figure out who I am from my van as well..."
327983,Marko,2009-04-08 22:20:00,854,Good luck guys and leave some for me.  Its a good chance I`ll be down there on Sunday.
327987,nancur373,2009-04-08 22:39:00,1211,We'll be at fishmaster's in the morning
327998,Joeytier,2009-04-08 23:25:00,3990,"I'll be at Fishmaster's Friday morning.  If you see an older red lund with a longer haired kid, say hi.  Would you say cut up sucker is the best bait?  And does Fishmaster have the bait available for purchase?"
328001,Marko,2009-04-08 23:36:00,854," I have caught catfish on chunks of hot dogs, chicken liver, 3-4 worms on a hook. But yes cut up sucker works probably the best and Fishmaster should have some in his shop, he did last year."
328012,Joeytier,2009-04-09 00:07:00,3990,"Alrighty, thanks."
328066,Joeytier,2009-04-09 01:35:00,3990,"Also, when will he be open on Friday?  Is it 9 like his messageboard says?"
328117,Djtbster,2009-04-09 03:24:00,2,"are there ane places i can go after these cats from shore i dont have a boat, any help would be appriciated thanks"

Fishmaster
328260,Gerritt,2009-04-09 17:51:00,6129,Ok I will be there.... Mike (Bitsmith2k) will be with me and possibly Goran (Uncle Buck) Look for the beige Polarkraft with the OFC flag  G..
