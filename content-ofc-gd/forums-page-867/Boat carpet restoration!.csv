329004,walleyemen,2009-04-11 22:47:00,316,"I started this project before i found the damage to my hull ,so having started it i figured i'd finish it as well. I removed all the carpeted panels in the boat to recarpet them, not a very easy job but doable!      As you can see in the last picture is was a nightmare removing panels around the steering cables, so i supprted the top of the console and removed the panels from around it. This is what i have gotten down so far as of today, hopefully by the end of the weekend i can have her finished, Materials so far are at about $200, and about 20 hours of work.      "
