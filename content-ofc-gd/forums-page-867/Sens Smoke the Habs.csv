328064,Northhunter,2009-04-09 01:33:00,214,"Florida lost last night, so Montreal needs a point.  Does nobody remember the last time Boston was the 1st seed? They were big then too, and tried to run Montreal through the boards and out of the building... and lost.  Habs are a team built around puck posession and speed. Markov and Schneider were two of the best. When Price is on his game and playing the puck like he does, he's like a 3rd D. They are not big bruising stay at home d-men (that's what O'byrne; 6'5"" 237lbs, and Komisarek; 6'4"" - 242lbs, are supposed to be) but it's a different game today - they will burn you if you try and push them around and end up shorthanded. Schneider was a godly at keeping the puck in the offensive zone, which is huge when you have 2 mins to make something happen and was the reason the powerplay blossomed when he came over. His shot from the point was nice, too. Now they are both gone and Price has been off. But it's a cardinal rule of NHL hockey - anything can happen in the playoffs. All they need is a win over the Bruins or Pens and they likely draw 7th and the Caps. Imagine if they made it far enough that they got all three of Markov, Schneider, and Lang back... it might be a pipe dream, but that's why they play the games."
328207,lookinforwalleye,2009-04-09 14:04:00,4399,"As usual you are out to lunch, Laraque challenged Lucic earlier this year and all he did was tuck his tail between his legs and skate away.  Lucic would not drop the gloves with Laraque, no balls you see!!!"
328245,jediangler,2009-04-09 16:36:00,1923,"Lucic is a tough hockey player. Laroque is a goon. Lucic was playing on his teams first line. Laroque was riding the pine. Lucic will be dressed for every playoff game and actually get some ice time. Laroque, not likely. The Bruins were leading by 3 goals at the time, why would he fight? You must be a Habs fan, good luck with that   ."
328252,lookinforwalleye,2009-04-09 17:12:00,4399, I can`t really argue with most of what you say but the fact remains he tucked tail and skated away when challenged.

328266,BassAsin,2009-04-09 18:08:00,806,"just look out for next year,  hartsberg had them at 17-27-7  clouston has them at 19-10-3  clouston's rochester team was in good standings when he was there and had a deccent playoff position now they are out of the playoffs  so is the sens .666 winning record just playing without pressure or his coaching  the players like him and the results are quite apparent  next year i dont predict habs fans making fun of us for not making playoffs.            IF they make the playoffs. kinda sad they bank on other  teams to lose so they can make the playoffs. if they could win a game on their own they wouldnt need to watch florida play hockey!"
328272,lookinforwalleye,2009-04-09 18:18:00,4399,Ottawa has a professional sports franchise???
328348,Northhunter,2009-04-09 22:14:00,214," Nobody was making fun the the Sens missing the playoffs - but we all know how the thread was started.  Habs are not banking on other teams losing. They need a point to clinch. Nobody else earned them their 41 wins.  As for the 19-10-3 record, I think it's a bit of both. This Sens squad has been up and down the last couple seasons. They play extremely well and then tank it for a bit with no apparent reason. Last season was the same, they were talking of dismantling the team and starting over for cryin' out loud, but they picked it up late in the year and made the playoffs."
328355,jediangler,2009-04-09 22:47:00,1923,"I wouldn't want to mess with ""Big George"". Under contract for 2 more years at 1.5 million, he must be the highest dollars per minute player ever. He's been the undisputed heavywieght going on 10 years now, and I hope fighting is never removed from the game. Maybe he was just asking Lucic for a signed stick or something   . "
328413,lookinforwalleye,2009-04-10 01:08:00,4399,Spirited game too bad big George is not in the line up I can think of a few Bruins that could use a good slap namely Thorton every time this idiot is on the ice he`s dropping his gloves. I guarantee that if BGL was in the line up those gloves would stay on!
328429,jediangler,2009-04-10 02:31:00,1923,"It was a good game, felt like a playoff tilt. Bruins 5-4 in OT."
328622,Northhunter,2009-04-10 22:35:00,214,What? I thought the Canadiens were all heartless cowards who want to go home and would bow down to teams like the big bad bruins.  Certainly didn't look like it last night.
328765,Cookslav,2009-04-11 04:04:00,1457,"LOL.... They made it in by a single point after such a stellar start I can't say that after having one close game vs the Bruins that THEY LOST is any reason to think they have the slightest chance of Winning the cup... They are one of the worst teams ""in the league"" as of the the last half of the season...they just coasted off a good start. But in all honesty, I wish 'em luck... I'm no fan by any means, but I like to see the Canadian teams do well. But I'd say regardless,  Be it washington, or Boston...I smell a sweep"
328787,Northhunter,2009-04-11 04:45:00,214," There are only 4 points separating 4th and 8th.  Despite the rollercoaster year, they did what they had to and are there. That's better than the 14 teams that have no chance at all"
327337,Whitespinnerbait,2009-04-07 02:18:00,2038,Wonder what the Canadian fans are doing right about now..  :blahblah1:
327346,Leecher,2009-04-07 02:37:00,7832,Going to bed   :lol:
327351,JohnAB,2009-04-07 02:43:00,178,Actually we are getting ready to watch our team in the playoffs. Sens fans on the other hand are still trying to console themselves after they were eliminated from playoff contention 20 games into the season!
327383,Cookslav,2009-04-07 03:45:00,1457," Oh boy... Don't jinx yourself yet!  They are only 3 points ahead of the Rangers & Panthers who are tied for that last spot. The Hab have to face the Rangers, Boston, and Pittsburgh for their last 3 games....no easy run. I could see them looseing all three...  Rangers are Do or die...lot of motivation, and way more depth in their line up Boston will simply kill them and Pittsburgh...well,they might beat them, they might not?  Florida has 2 tough games yet...Philly, and Washington, but they got an easy game in there vs Atlanta as well Rangers Next 3...Philly, then the Habs, and then Philly again(weird?)  Don't count your chickens before they hatch! Oooooh I love the close finish"
327446,jediangler,2009-04-07 12:58:00,1923,"Schneider is out for the season and Markov is out 3 weeks, in other words Markov is out for the season as well. If they make it, they won't win a game against anyone without these two ""D"" men."
327557,Cookslav,2009-04-07 17:40:00,1457," I totally agree... And the key word is ""if"" they make it.  I give em a 50/50 shot which is actually pretty horrible considering they have a 3 point Lead LOL!. They actually don't deserve to go IMO. After the Slide they had this year, the only reason they will make it it because of the Start they had out of the blocks.... They just kinda coasted for the rest of the season, and now their struggling. I like to see Canadian teams in the Playoffs but this year I'd rather see the panthers in there. As a kitchener Boy I'd like to see Pete take his team there in his first season....he's one heck of a coach, and he's shown it this year. First year inthe big league and shaping his band of misfits into a well balanced team. Thats his trade mark... As a good coach he builds depth, and develops a ""team System""...never has he put his eggs into one basket, and relied on one line. Its a start, and their not deep enough to win it all but it would really showcase his abilitys, and who knows... Somtimes these dark horse teams that ramp up in the end can make for some pretty exciting hockey! The leafs of '93 come to mind under Patty Burns ex Hab coach...how ironic"
327578,BassAsin,2009-04-07 18:46:00,806,"unlike the habs, the sens just didnt wanna make the playoffs they havnt had a chance at an early tee time since 95' unlike the habs!  i wouldnt be suprised if auld and price have tee times booked together!"
327579,BassAsin,2009-04-07 18:49:00,806,"the year carolina went to the end and lost, they didnt have enough points to even be in the playoffs but led the divison, nobody saw them losing in the finals..    can you say IRBE? hahah he played well"
327607,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-07 19:44:00,3761,The Habs are crap...there going nowhere in the playoffs and thats that....not going to say who my fav team is but it is not one of these two teams

327616,Maverick,2009-04-07 20:08:00,371,"Now first off, I'm a Sens fan and I know, they aren't going to make the playoffs but in some respect I would rather have my team play well and compete towards the end of the season even if they aren't going to make it. It builds for next season and things are going in the right track which is nice to see for once. The habs on the other hand look like a mirror image of the sens last season, complete collapse in the second half of the season and complete turmoil. No saying what is going to happen in the playoffs but Montreal will have to do a complete 180 if they want to compete.  On a side note, it looks like Schnider is going to NY to get a second opinion on his shoulder. You know it's bad when that happens. They are in trouble without him and Makrov though. Looks like Grabovski got the last laugh after all. Call him a cheapshot artist if you want but Koivu is just as bad."
327625,diggyj,2009-04-07 20:28:00,548,"What a crappy year for Canadian hockey. Not only are the LEAFS going to miss the post season(GIVEN), but so are the SENS and the OILERS.

The potential buyers identified by the public broadcaster include the province's pension-fund manager, the Caisse de depot et placement; Guy Laliberte, owner of Cirque du soleil; and Les Productions Feeling, which is run by Rene Angelil, husband and manager of pop superstar Celine Dion.  Others include the Claridge investment house; media giant Quebecor; Joey Saputo, owner of the Montreal Impact soccer team; Roustan Capital; the Molson family; Spectrum Equity; and the Aldo Group.  Potential buyers have been given until 5 p.m. on Thursday to make a bid, the network reported.  Former Montreal Canadiens general manager Serge Savard has also said he and a group of partners are prepared to buy the National Hockey League franchise if it is put up for sale.  Canadiens majority shareholder George Gillett is currently seeking advice from financial firms in Canada and elsewhere about how he might maximize his holdings, which also include parts of English soccer giant Liverpool, the Richard Petty Motorsports NASCAR team, and event promoter Gillett Entertainment Group."

GO HABS GO  i dont think anybody with the money to by such a hockey team would have to worry, they'd be laughin to the bank all the way, i'll believ gillette intends to sell when he says so, ""seeking financial advice"" is only common sense to a money man like George Gillett and is probably done every year by all these money men, the media needs stories and turns into a possible sale,  GO HABS GO"
