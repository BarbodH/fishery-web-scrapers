328648,Minnow,2009-04-11 00:01:00,177,"Hey Guys,  Was in fishing the Grand River this morning from 8 am to about 12 pm, and from the moment we set our lines to the last double header the cats were co-operating. I don't do a lot of catfishing so I don't know if this is a normal day for cats but for me it seemed like a really great day on the water. My grandpa and I caught 12 Catfish in the span of 4 hours and had 2 double headers. I would say all of the cats were over the 10 lb mark and some might have been pushing the 20 mark. Best catfishing day on the water I ever had and will definately be heading back again! Just need a couple days for my arms to recover!  Here are some of the Cats          "

328676,Joeytier,2009-04-11 00:58:00,3990,The wind was unrelenting.  Shore fishing would've been much more comfortable.
