326296,Fish4Eyes,2009-04-04 19:58:00,1022,"I have original princecraft seats that came with my boat but, the L brackets on the back of the seat bent. Can somebody recommend where I can buy a quality seat that will not break. Keep in mind I am 280 pounds and i do like to lean back in the seat. I have looked at the wise big man seat at bass pro, but I can physically break it with my hands if I wanted to, they dont stand up to their name thats for sure. Willing to pay for quality, and suggestions?"

I had the Wise seats in my first boat, for the money they took a lot of punishment. Contact Leisure Marine, they know their stuff.  http://www.leisuremarine.com/service.html"

328029,Fudd,2009-04-09 00:32:00,94,"http://www.boatingseats.com/default.asp  I would highly recommend the Attwood seats, i am your size, actually bigger and they are very very good. Have a look around the site they have a massive selection, or give them a call. Good guys to deal with.  This is the one i had http://www.boatingseats.com/Boat-Seats/265...-Boat-Seats.asp"

328564,Fish4Eyes,2009-04-10 18:13:00,1022, I went on the website and it said that they don't ship to Canada. Did they ship to you in Canada or do you reside in the States?
