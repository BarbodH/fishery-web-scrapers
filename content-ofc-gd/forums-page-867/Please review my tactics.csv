328969,mpagnan,2009-04-11 21:36:00,84,"Good afternoon all,  Today I tried 2 new things, fishing for Steelhead on the Credit at Erindale.  I was out there for 4 -5 hours and had not one bite.  I was wondering if someone would be kind enough to point out anything I need to improve on?  My set-up  10' 6"" pole with 10 lb mono - 8 lb leader Float with 4 evenly spaced split shots under 3"" pinkie on a #6 hook  Where  From the damn heading North to the big bend to the right  Observations  On the majority of my casts the bobber remained upright during its run suggesting that the weight was correct and the worm was off the bottom.  I found that it moved naturally with the current.  Thanks for your suggestions,  Mr. Depressed"
328975,Phil 65,2009-04-11 21:45:00,37,I think all you need now is confidence its the best thing I have ever tied to my line . there is no magic lure or bait .
328981,mpagnan,2009-04-11 21:52:00,84,"Phil65,  Thanks for the encouragement but I've never really had success with my fishing and I love the sport.  It's just very disheartening when you appear to be doing everything right time and time again but no success."
328984,Phil 65,2009-04-11 22:03:00,37,"Was anybody else catching today , were you beating dead water . I have fished 3 in a boat with everone using the same bait / lure and seen guys not catch . its what makes this the best sport in the world . you never know it all . never give up you just have to out think a fish how hard could that be . LOL ."
328993,kemper,2009-04-11 22:31:00,2232,"Steelheading is specific. If you werent catching and others were chances are you werent drifting the right areas.  Generally, a small amount of the water on a river holds most of the fish."
329023,Leecher,2009-04-11 23:32:00,7832,Pags I'm no expert nor have any experience in stealheading but I think that persistence and determination is key to this type of fishing.  Another thing.... if you see your shadow in the water.... you're on the wrong side of the river Good luck to ya!!! Leechman

329033,salmon,2009-04-12 00:10:00,334,The only dam that I know of on the Credit is the the one in streetsville. If it is it is a closed section. Please read your regs. Jose
329034,buckster,2009-04-12 00:12:00,530,i think he means the ice breakers... at least i hope
329037,FUSION,2009-04-12 00:17:00,81, The river does not bend to the right north of the icebreakers... It does though north of the dam.
329041,johnnyb,2009-04-12 00:21:00,3413,"Well, if he started in Erindale park, I'm thinkin' it was a LONG walk to Streetsville.  Pags...give us an answer here...where did you park?"
329046,mpagnan,2009-04-12 00:32:00,84,"Guys,  Relax.  I was in Erindale park by the large walkover bridge.  If you head a little North there is a slight bend to the right.  That was the best way I could describe it.  There were at least 20 guys North of me."
329049,steelhead hunter,2009-04-12 00:49:00,152,first off a #6hook with a pinky is was to big try around a #10 drop your leader to around 5lbs and then keep walking that strech of river isn't that productive above the breakers the fish just shoot right through there better luck on your next trip
329084,rbaquial,2009-04-12 02:17:00,968,"I used to live 5min away from Erindale Park in Mississauga for 25+yrs... I've always tried fishing there during the run... but never caught a steelhead. I was using 'Bass Tackle' at the time but still using the appropriate terminal tackle setup to catch them.  Anyway, now I've got the right 'gear' (Float rod and all) - I'm still trying to catch the illusive ""Steelhead""  Just stay positive and things will eventually come your way! (at least that's the attitude I'm taking)  Good luck, and don't forget to report once you hook into a Chromer! I'm still looking forward to catching my 1st Chromer Report!"
329144,camillj,2009-04-12 11:47:00,1988,"The key to catching steelhead in ANY trib is to understand EXACTLY where they are under each condition (light, colour of water, temp, amount of activity from anglers etc) ... then to place your drift so that they literally dnt need to move to inhale your bait .... get that part right and you'll start catching all the fish even when the guy beside you cant get a hookup.  The easiest way to do this is to stand (without a rod) over top of a fish for a few hours ... and watch how it moves ...  Probably the most important tool on a river besides experience and patience is a good set of polaroids."
