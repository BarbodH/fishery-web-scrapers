329221,stratosdude,2009-04-12 15:59:00,2,Hello everyone  My name is Mike and I am new to this site. It looks like the ice for the most part is off Lake Simcoe. I was wondering if anyone has been out for perch and if they have found any productive spots for the start of our open water spring season? Thanks to all who reply!  Happy Easter to all
