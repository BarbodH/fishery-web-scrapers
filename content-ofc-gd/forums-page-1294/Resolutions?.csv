17763,SlowPoke,2006-12-31 21:11:00,2984,Every year at this time many of us make new years resolutions. Every year I vow to do 1-9 but this year I have added #10 after seeing GCD's new shade of white.
17767,Greencoachdog,2006-12-31 21:22:00,8163,Of course you know which one it voted for.  ... but who was the wise acre that cast the other vote???

17876,SlowPoke,2007-01-01 00:41:00,2984,Fish a new species? [ 0 ]   [0.00%] Find a better job? [ 0 ]   [0.00%] Be a better spouse? [ 0 ]   [0.00%]  The early polling results would suggest that most of the OFC Community are likely Bass Pros that enjoy thier job and wish to continue treating thier spouses poorly.
17878,nautifish,2007-01-01 00:45:00,1416,I have never really been into the resolution thing every year.  Just happy to have good health great kids and be able to fish.  But if i was to vote it would be avoiding a certain persons tanlines for sure.......
17879,Rich,2007-01-01 00:48:00,3927,I'd like to fish a new species since losing weight and quitting anything are not a viable option.
17895,Greencoachdog,2007-01-01 01:34:00,8163,"  I do intend to avoid those unsightly tan lines, but this by no means... means I'm wearing a shirt in 100+*F weather... as a matter of fact... it means quite the opposite!... Aaaaaaaaaaaah Au Natural!!!!"

17911,pameladallaire,2007-01-01 03:20:00,470,"I decided to make resolutions about my work.  Painting and so I would have to keep on track I posted them on my website.  Now, if I slacken a bit, a few people following my work will give me a swift kick in the bee=hind and I'll get where I want to go.  Oh, and I like tan lines.  Pam"
18059,Beans,2007-01-01 14:37:00,3339,I figured I should give up chasing fast women and betting on slow horses this year but decided to concentrate on how I could reverse the order...
18071,Terry,2007-01-01 15:20:00,14456,about 16 years ago I made a new years resolution to never make another new years resolution ever again...I have not broke that resolution to date and I am better for it
18078,bpsbassman,2007-01-01 16:00:00,941,"I chose the ""lose weight"" category as I have done in the past (and temporarily succeeded), but the fact is I AM GETTING OLDER and I need to take better care of myself. My real choice wasn't up there: Spend more time/LESS MONEY Fishing!!!"
18087,Mike the Pike,2007-01-01 16:48:00,3421,I really have lose some weight I am going to try and trade the Keg for a six pack.Since taking a sales job on the road 7 yrs ago I am 25lbs heavier and the holidays did not help.I drive 1000kms a week not good for the waistline.The wife just got cordless headphones for the stereo which I will be borrowing to take my walks on the treadmill.I 've got to do this I am starting to feel like a blowfish.
18096,douG,2007-01-01 17:18:00,2693,"The Resident Love Goddess got me a step counter, one of those little lcd jobs that clip on your belt.  Apparently, 'our' goal is to walk 10,000 steps a day, every day,  forever.  We just got back from a brisk one hour jaunt, I logged 5200 and she 6300.  It feels good,  but the forever thing is a little daunting.  I could stand to lose about 25 lbs and bump the metabolic rate up a notch or two, but it will take some commitment.  I hate those lifestyle change thingies."
18109,irishfield,2007-01-01 18:05:00,26272,DOUG ! Take shorter steps! LOL
