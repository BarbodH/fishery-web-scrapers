We have created a board (still invisible to all but moderators) that will house all the entries. Your team and its captain will be responsible for your own stats. There will be bonus points awarded on a condition or two. Each team will have their own forum with a thread for each species of fish. The team captain will be given moderator abilities for their forum. Because of this the captains will be selected by the site admins prior to the draft. Sign ups will occur on a special sign up thread. No more emails! No more complicated draws. We'll simply go down the list in the thread and assigning teams. There will be ten teams. There will be 11 fish categories. CATFISH ARE IN!!! As soon as we have the final rules and legal junk done, we'll open the new forum area to the public."

18251,Crazyhook,2007-01-02 02:31:00,1154,beauty!!!! love the idea of the tournament and love the changes! bring on 07!
18252,irishfield,2007-01-02 02:36:00,26272,Jamie....12 months of training...have you got the OFC logo in a picture embedded in your brain yet!? We sure could have used one of your skis or carp last year.
18259,Crazyhook,2007-01-02 02:44:00,1154,"you got one of my carp!!!! ( had about a dozen 6"" bigger though!!)  I will make sure I have a laminated OFC logo in my box...  to be honest I got fed up with the turn around time and how it was not updated. Made it hard"
18261,irishfield,2007-01-02 02:50:00,26272,Well I didn't...but hopefully Mike did for our team entry.  Sounds like Rick has the update issue taken care of this '07 round and has smartly made it the teams responsibility to do so and not his. Step one in his 2007 resolutions checked off!!
18284,Marc Thorpe,2007-01-02 10:49:00,621,Maybe he should get an OFC Tatoo
