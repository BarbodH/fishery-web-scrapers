18138,Rich,2007-01-01 21:32:00,3927,"Sleded and myself headed over to a semi-local spot today in search of treats and perch. I stuck to my vorms while Sleded used minerals and we made quite a team. I'd say it was a very successful day, the wind was nippy but we stuck it out and got a pail full of sweet, wonderful fillet meat. When those tasty fillets hit your tongue, it makes every minnow used feel like petty cash - Trademark, Rich Enterprises 2007  And now for picsssssssssseeeeeeeeeeooooooooooooweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!   Sleded's lazy treat setup   My expensive rod holder   A nice attention perch   Sleded's attention stick   A treat laying next to the high tech equipment used to land her   Some troll holding a treat   Sleded got the biggest attention fish of the day however with this nice little pike.  All in all a great day to kick off the year!"
18139,fish4me,2007-01-01 21:44:00,59,"Nice going there, how deep were the fish and how many did you end up catching for the day?  Amazing to still catch fish at this time of  year from shore, that's impressive!!!!  Pice seema bit blurry,, using a new camera?"
