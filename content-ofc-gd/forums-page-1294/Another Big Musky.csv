18559,Roy,2007-01-03 11:36:00,13728,"Nice fish, Phil. Congrats to Howard. Muskie Magnet???"
18560,DrPhil,2007-01-03 11:44:00,30,"Roy,  Howard didn't say he has several of our baits but didn't mention what he nailed it on.  The only thing I know about the fish, it came from the Allegheny River."

18611,bpsbassman,2007-01-03 14:33:00,941,Did he catch that from shore??
18614,DrPhil,2007-01-03 14:42:00,30,Marc  the best to you and yours in the coming year.  Looks like your buddy John is going to do the Milwaukee show with us this year.  The Chi town show was booked but we are also looking at the St. Catherines Odessey 2007 show.  Phil what we learned from the Columbus show--you don't take jerk baits to a trolling area--we did poorly at that show.  bpsbassman  yes he said he was wading but Howard knows the Allegheny he knows the holes.
