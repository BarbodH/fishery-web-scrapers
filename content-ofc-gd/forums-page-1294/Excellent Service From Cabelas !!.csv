18415,lew,2007-01-02 23:46:00,12767,"I phoned Cabelas this past Friday and ordered a GPS / Sonar combo and was told it would arrive in 7 business days, so figuring the weekend and then the New Years holidays, I wasn't expecting it till sometime early next week, but darned if it didn't arrive this morning.  Kinda nice when you receive even better service than your expecting  Only problem is my boat is hibernating in a barn 100 miles from here and I won't get a chance to install and use my new toy for another 4 months  "
18416,fishindevil,2007-01-02 23:49:00,6254,"thats a great ,very powerful unit lew,you made the right choice  no fish can hide from that unit"
18421,Greencoachdog,2007-01-02 23:53:00,8163,"Cabelas has much better service than BassPro when it comes to mail order, mainly because Cabelas uses UPS for everything and BassPro uses the post office for their ground shipping.  I don't know if you do the credit card thing or not Lew, but if you do... check into getting a Cabelas Visa Rewards card. I don't know how many hundreds of dollars of free stuff I've gotten from them by using their card!"
18422,irishfield,2007-01-02 23:57:00,26272,Gee...one new item into the house and another out the next day. One way of keeping things tidy ! LOL
18456,Dondorfish,2007-01-03 01:23:00,1000,I have ordered from Cabelas on countless occasions and find them to be very professional  to deal with. Lew - Nice unit - but I wouldn't think that you had any trouble finding the fish - based on some of your amazing reports!    Don
18457,danc,2007-01-03 01:27:00,4677,Nice unit Lew. Expect nothing less from Cabelas. I've been mail ordering from them since the 70's and haven't had a bad experience yet.
18459,Crazyhook,2007-01-03 01:31:00,1154,beauty one Lew! I can picture the bulldawg bouncing bottom!
18464,lew,2007-01-03 01:41:00,12767,"This is only my 2nd time dealing with Cabelas, but they certainly make it easy to deal with them."
18480,fishdawg,2007-01-03 02:15:00,912,very nice Lew - ive only herd the best about Cabela's thats a great unit too - i noticed the special they were having on it - May will come soon!
18481,Smokey,2007-01-03 02:15:00,1278,Nice buy Lew. After fishing with Richard this fall a machine like that is sure the way to go. I'll be looking for something come spring time for my boat.  Good Luck with it.
18505,Rattletrap2,2007-01-03 03:04:00,1652,"Nice Lew! Glad you had a good experience with them. Won't be long.....and they will be here too! First Montreal, then hopefully us!"
18536,Squid,2007-01-03 04:21:00,1656,Nice!!!
18537,Joey,2007-01-03 04:35:00,9122,"That's great Lew, I ordered Paul's Christmas gift from them and all three items were here within a week (the week before Christmas no less), so I was very impressed.  That was the third time I ordered from them and I'm pleased with their product and service.  Speaking of good service, Paul and I finally decided our old camera was not good enough any more after his pics from BOQ a few weeks ago all turned out fuzzy, so Thursday night we decided to go to our Airmiles site and see what cameras we could get for the airmiles we had.  We decided on the Canon Powershot A430 and I ordered.  I got my confirmation by email stating it would be 4 to 6 weeks.  Well, guess what, it arrived today by Purolator.  I was astounded like you were Lew, right after the Christmas rush too.  So Kudos to Airmiles Reward Miles too  Joey"
18552,SlowPoke,2007-01-03 10:45:00,2984,"Good service comes as no surprise... they've always been my first choice for ordering - I wish they had Jeep and Astro parts too!  So Lew, what's your next Cabelas purchase? Does it rhyme with ""Curado 300""?  -Brian"
18569,lew,2007-01-03 12:30:00,12767, I'm afraid that won't be on any order forms for awhile yet Brian
18577,Whopper,2007-01-03 12:58:00,2174,Nice looking new toy Lew Congrats!  Whopper
18579,crappiesteve,2007-01-03 13:18:00,220,"Very nice indeed Lew,fish beware you are being watched.  Steve"
18581,dustink,2007-01-03 13:28:00,526,"Very nice Lew!  By the time the boat comes out, you should have the manual memorized and be ready to go.  dk  PS - GCD, I have the Cabela's Visa and use it for all our gas purchases, and love cashing in the points for free gear!!"
18586,hawkeye,2007-01-03 13:34:00,162,"Nice unit. The guide I was with down in Florida had one. Spot a hump push a button, go on fishing, then easy to navigate back to the hump.  Cabelas is way out front of Bass Pro. Last time my wife ordered me something from Bass Pro as a birthday present it came UPS, (the brown dog). Between brokerage and shipping I it came to over $50.  We all learned from that one now she gives me BPS gift cards"
18700,Eddyk,2007-01-03 20:06:00,195,With all these new toys you may finally catch a Pickeral in Quinte this spring.
