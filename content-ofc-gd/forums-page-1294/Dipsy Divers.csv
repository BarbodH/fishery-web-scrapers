18149,pameladallaire,2007-01-01 22:20:00,470,OK guys and gals.  Where can I get a Dipsy Diver??  Bass Pro was out of them when my brother-in-law went shopping for them befor xmas.  Pam
18168,glen,2007-01-01 22:53:00,2641,Some crappy tire stores have them.  Any fishing shop should have them.  I have some that dont get used alot cause they take away from the fight of the fish.
18169,spoonman,2007-01-01 22:58:00,103,You can get them at Tightlines in Pickering Brock Road and 401 just south on brock on west side. JBs fishing Depot should have them as well. Hope this helps.
18171,Smokey,2007-01-01 23:00:00,1278,Yeah Canadian Tire should have them.
18197,fishindevil,2007-01-02 00:20:00,6254,"tightlines in pickering has the best selection of them as well as snubbers and releases,and they have slide-divers as well as jet divers,and all the accesories to go with them just ask for john or jamie....cheers"
18201,ChrisK,2007-01-02 00:32:00,2772,If your ever down this way(London) drop into Lambeth Rod and Tackle...Steve always has alot of that stuff hanging on his walls year round....  Good Luck !!
18203,brifishrgy,2007-01-02 00:36:00,559,could always do mail order from Le Barons
18205,ChrisK,2007-01-02 00:41:00,2772,Ya but then that would give him an excuse to get out the credit card and we all know what would happen next
18230,The Urban Fisherman,2007-01-02 01:41:00,2050,hey Pam!  I was @ BPS on friday and they had 'em again!!!  good luck!  uf

18299,b2kptbo,2007-01-02 14:34:00,1505,Seen some at Le Barons last week but where $2 more than BPS...
18319,Garyv,2007-01-02 17:15:00,547,"There are different diameters of Dipsy's for you to pick from.  Figure out the correct size for what your intended use is.  They can put a lot of strain on your equiptment so make sure they are used with the proper gear, especially if using them at deeper depths."
18498,pameladallaire,2007-01-03 02:55:00,470,"Thanks guys, we just need 30 ft. and 50 ft. divers.  I'll ask Canadian Tire if they can get them in.  If not, I've had an offer to go shopping for me at BPS.  Pam"
18562,Steve,2007-01-03 11:49:00,2075,"to get a diver down 30 feet, you'll need the number   as was mentioned above, you'll need the proper equipment if you want to run either of the two bigger ones.  rod holders that aren't plastic (scotty, big jon). Down Easters will work best. Second you'll need a longer, stronger rod. Quantum Affinity makes an affordable dipsy rod at 10.5 ft. finally line counter reels are used most often, so when you do get a hit, you can try to mimick the amount of line let out......  finally, make sure your pulling them with strong line. personally i use 50lbs braid with 30lbs flouro leads (for salmon).....  but even if your using them for a more dosile fish, like erie walleye, make sure your using the correct tackle.....  have fun. dipsy's caught more salmon and trout for me this year than anything else on my boat.    Hope this helps Pam,  STeve"
18628,pameladallaire,2007-01-03 16:11:00,470,"Thanks Steve:  My husband has his choice of rods from our living room display case.  Also has a new counter reel and his new boat should have good rod holders, I'll check.  No problem with the tackle.  He likes using fireline.  Don't know whether that will be the correct line.  Thanks for the info.  Pam"
18629,Steve,2007-01-03 16:16:00,2075,"no problem pam.  sounds like your husband is all set!  i've found dipsy's were my single most important tool when going onto lake ontario....the day i forgot my dipsy box i just went home....  the fireline sounds good. braided line is important so there isn't line stretch. the hits are very vicious with dipsy's, much more than a rigger, therefore the rod holders are important.  hope he has fun, and join him if you have the time....i've found nothing beats the quiet times trolling in open water....."
18631,pameladallaire,2007-01-03 16:23:00,470,Thanks Steve:  I've been drooling over the new boat and cursing because I've been taking care of my mom the last 2 years since her stroke/heart surgery.  I don't have a choice at the moment but will find a way.  Pam
