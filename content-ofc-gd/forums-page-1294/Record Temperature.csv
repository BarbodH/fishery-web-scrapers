18281,lew,2007-01-02 10:06:00,12767,Toronto set a new January 1st temperature record yesterday of 9.2 C  Crazy stuff !!
18282,motv8tr,2007-01-02 10:44:00,2587,"Yup, just squeeked in with it though, in 1979 it was 9.1C  Maureen"
18292,hawkeye,2007-01-02 13:15:00,162,And it's not supposed to get any cooler for awhile. I posted a comment last week about Keswick being forecasted to be +12 in a week or so. I didn't post the link so there were some unbelievers.  So here is today's 14 day forecast for Keswick http://www.weather.ca/weather/14day/pages/CAON0342.htm  yes that's +12 on the 12th  Consider that this is from the foks who can't get it right 24 hours in advance. I might dispute the +12 but you can't dispute the trend
18296,Fish Farmer,2007-01-02 13:58:00,2234,"I've organized an Ice fishing bus trip for Jan 28, 47 guys. Now I'm starting to sweat  . If we do get any ice, it may be short lived."
18380,mason05,2007-01-02 22:49:00,258,"A dozen of us are to hit Hyatt's on Callendar early February.  Not looking good if the ""trends"" keep up.  Damn global warming."
18390,GbayGiant,2007-01-02 23:13:00,1780,My prediction is Jan 20th safe ice. I'll give 2-1 odds.
18393,Bernie,2007-01-02 23:17:00,3190,2 to 1 odds. On what lake? Safe to walk on or to snowmobile to?...Details please   ps...I hope you are right
18395,Raf,2007-01-02 23:22:00,3495,how's callander bay looking nipissing?  we're booked jan 19-21st wknd.  iffy to say the least.
18396,GbayGiant,2007-01-02 23:22:00,1780,Let me think about it. I'll let you know on the 19th.
18401,Frank,2007-01-02 23:29:00,74,"This is ridiculas, I bought a bunch of ice fishing equipment last winter and barely had a chance to use it and this season looks to be worse."
18404,Bernie,2007-01-02 23:33:00,3190,"O man it isnt looking good....Not only cant fish but I have to move a boathouse from one island to mine..I need at least a foot or more of good blue....As long as we dont get a lot of snow before it turns cold might be ok for February....This isnt good for all of us in this area...The outfitters, snowmobile dealers and repair centers,motels/hotels, gasoline retailers etc....will make it tough for lots of people who depend on winter."
18406,FishFinder,2007-01-02 23:34:00,481,"This weather is amazing, for steelheading.. too bad for all the icefishermen"
18407,pameladallaire,2007-01-02 23:37:00,470,It's supposed to rain and be above 0 here till Friday.  20 deg. above normal.  Pam
