18236,kemper,2007-01-02 01:56:00,2232,"If your looking at rods check out Fenwicks, Ive got one and I love it to death. Its really tough, light and sensitive but also has enough backbone to fish salmon. At 11.5 feet (I think) its perfect for drifting the smaller rivers that I fish, but im sure it would handle bigger ones as well."
