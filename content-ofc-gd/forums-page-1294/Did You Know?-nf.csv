I came across this one as I was deleteing all the junk that I had. This one was sent from one of my friends afew years back.   Did You Know....  Each king in a deck of playing cards represents a great king from history: Spades - King David Hearts - Charlemagne Clubs - Alexander the Great Diamonds - Julius Caesar  If a statue in the park of a person on a horse has both front legs in the air, the person died in battle. If the horse has one front leg in the air the person died as a result of wounds received in battle. If the horse has all four legs on the ground, the person died of natural causes.  In Shakespeare's time, mattresses were secured on bed frames by ropes. When you pulled on the ropes the mattress tightened, making the bed firmer to sleep on. Hence the phrase ""goodnight, sleep tight"".  It was the accepted practice in Babylon 4,000 years ago that for a month after the wedding, the bride's father would supply his son-in-law with all the mead he could drink. Mead is a honey beer and because their calendar was lunar based, this period was called the honey month - or what we know today as the honeymoon.  In Scottland, a new game was invented. It was entitled Gentlemen Only, Ladies Forbidden... and thus the word GOLF entered into the English language.  In Africa ever morning, a gazelle wakes up knowing that it must outrun the fastest lion on the grasslands if it wants to stay alive. Also every morning, a lion wakes up nowing that it must run faster than the slowest gazelle in the area or it will starve to death. It makes no difference whether you are a lion or a gazelle, when the sun comes up you had better be running."

18258,Rich Clemens,2007-01-02 02:49:00,3131,"Soooooooo..  My father-in-law owe's me a month's worth of beer !!!!    Hmmmm ... with 4,000 years of inflation, I wonder what it would be worth now ?"
18267,John Bacon,2007-01-02 03:25:00,3277,"  I am not sure about the others; but that one is not true.  That is not how ""golf"" was spelled back then.  Plus, I think the Scotts were still speaking gaelic at that time."
18313,douG,2007-01-02 16:51:00,2693,"Like most modern words, the word ""golf"" derives from older languages and dialects. In this case, the languages in question are medieval Dutch and old Scots.  The medieval Dutch word ""kolf"" or ""kolve"" meant ""club."" It is believed that word passed to the Scots, whose old Scots dialect transformed the word into ""golve,"" ""gowl"" or ""gouf.""  By the 16th Century, the word ""golf"" had emerged.  Sources: British Golf Museum, USGA Library"
