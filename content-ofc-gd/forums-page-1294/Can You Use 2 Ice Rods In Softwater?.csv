18263,wishn4fishn,2007-01-02 03:14:00,108,All the best in the new year.  I was just pondering if you can use 2 ice rods during the normal season.  I know in Muskoka some lakes forbid the use of 2 ice rods during ice fishing season.  What are the regulations?
18264,bigfish1965,2007-01-02 03:17:00,3382,Most lakes in Ontario do not let you use two rods in soft water. The great lakes do when you are in a boat. During ice season most lakes allow 2 rods provided they are both attended by the angler and you are on the ice.
18265,John Bacon,2007-01-02 03:17:00,3277,I am pretty sure that the the regs specify that you must be fishing through the ice to use the second line.
18302,SikkuDog,2007-01-02 15:00:00,8,"""Hooks and Lines â€“ An angler may use only one line, unless otherwise stated in the Regulations. Two lines may be used when angling from a boat in parts of the Great Lakes (see Exceptions to the General Regulations) and for ice fishing in many areas (see Ice Fishing, page 5). A fishing line must not have more than four hooks attached. Where an artificial lure is used, each double or treble hook attached to it is considered to be one hook. In all other situations, a double hook counts as two hooks; and a treble hook counts as three hooks."""
18331,Crazyhook,2007-01-02 18:34:00,1154,you can troll with two lines per person if you bring your auger and put it on the front of your boat
18337,tonyb,2007-01-02 18:58:00,1637,Or if you are fishing open water in a boat made out of ice  Tony
18342,setomonkey,2007-01-02 19:08:00,872, If you have to fish through the ice its going to be a short trip...    Mike
18344,douG,2007-01-02 19:25:00,2693,Why would it matter if you are using ice rods during the summer season or longer rods?  I don't get it.
18345,Garyv,2007-01-02 19:36:00,547,  Ditto!!!
18366,trparker,2007-01-02 21:58:00,6,"Where ever you go you should check the regs. It's free and if it doesn't mention the lake you're going to fish in the ""exception"" section of the regs then the general rules of that particular ""zone"" apply. Pretty simple."
