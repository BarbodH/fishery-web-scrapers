Planning on heading there for a spring Pike and walleye trip and was just wondering on peoples opinions of the area and any camps that they may have stayed at . Thanks"

The spawn tires the fish out until the second week of June and then gradually gets better and better until the big ones hit in Sept.  Any other info, just ask.  Pam"
