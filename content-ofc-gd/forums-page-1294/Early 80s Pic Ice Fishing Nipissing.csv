18262,Bernie,2007-01-02 02:52:00,3190,I was rooting through some pics from just a few years back. Early 80's I think. Note how many shacks there were.   I wish we had this much ice now

18438,Bernie,2007-01-03 00:33:00,3190,hmmm. It was there last night..Wasnt really much anyway.It was just a point i was making about the large increase in ice fishing since the early 80's. There was only one shack in the picture.
18440,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-03 00:37:00,2585, This year has it beat!!!  lol  just kidding i really hope the cold weather comes soon alot of people depend on ice fishing on lake nipissing and this warm weather is not a good thing for the communities that surround the lake.  snow would be nice for the sledders to!  Cheers!
