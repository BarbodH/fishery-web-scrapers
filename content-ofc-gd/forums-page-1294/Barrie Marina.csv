18303,misfish,2007-01-02 15:18:00,29133,Just had a chat with fisherman down at the docks.Action is very slow.Water is starting to clear up a bit.  Seen 7-9 inchers caught thats all.
18305,motv8tr,2007-01-02 15:25:00,2587,"Keep the reports coming fellas, I may try to head down for a couple of hours on Thursday with my friends 3 and 5 yr olds, they need to test out their new rods  .  I'm not concerned about size, I just want them to catch something.  If we go I'll be going to Tiffin launch as I expect the docks to be too unsteady for them  Maureen"
18312,pikeie,2007-01-02 16:50:00,380,"well i havent been able to head out yet  , i will be leaving in an hour or so  . the docks arnt really all that unstedy, the lauch would be better if u are worying about them falling. but the marina is also very shelterd so the wind and waves are all most non-exestent. so if u do bring them to the docks, they should still wear a life jacket, dont want to take that chance. good luck Mo"
18325,Rizzo,2007-01-02 17:44:00,4754,"good luck to both of you, let us know how you do"
