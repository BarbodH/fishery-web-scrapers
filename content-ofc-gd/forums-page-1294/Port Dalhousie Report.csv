We started our troll just north of the light house, along the west pier, then cut to the middle of the canal by the launch, and would go about 100' past the launch.  Unfortunately, not even a sniff.     We tried Rebel Fastracs, J-13's, DD HJ's, nadda.  After 4 passes and several S-turns, we figured it ain't going to get any better tonight, so we packed it in.  We probably marked only 10 fish all evening, which I found completey odd .  I thought we would at least mark lots of fish.  Oh well.  Anyone else fairing well out there lately?  Or were we just in the wrong area?? It was good getting out there again, haven't fished there in over a year."

18612,SHAD,2007-01-03 14:34:00,134, Port D can be hit or miss; Jello and I got into a half dozen or so this past Saturday from my boat but the shore guy's on the west side slayed them with roe!  Here's a couple bows we got.    
18619,Hooked,2007-01-03 15:20:00,891,"Thanks Shad.  At least that is promising should I want to head down there to fish from the West Pier.  I haven't heard any reports in a awhile pertaining there, at now I know some fish are indeed there."
