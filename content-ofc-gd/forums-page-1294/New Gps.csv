18419,bigfish1965,2007-01-02 23:52:00,3382,I picked up my new Lowrance H2Oc today from Fishing World. I'll have to go back in a few weeks or so and get the ram mount and the Navionics chip. Navionics will have Lake Nippissing on this years cards and the price is coming down too! Now I just gotta figure out how to dump a few cards into one so I don't need to carry (and therefore lose) a few different cards.
18431,Greencoachdog,2007-01-03 00:25:00,8163," Let me know when you get the dump figured out, because Ol' Yeller just ordered me one those same units today. I can hardly wait for it to mget here!"
18436,lew,2007-01-03 00:31:00,12767," Rick, is Nip gonna be a seperate card by itself, or will it be included on the Eastern Great Lakes chip and did you get a price on it ??"
18521,bigfish1965,2007-01-03 03:38:00,3382,"I think Nip will be in the Canada chip and not the Great Lakes chip, but not sure, Lew."
18532,bpsbassman,2007-01-03 03:59:00,941,That's interesting news Rick.  Keep us posted. Looking at upgrading this year and purchasing a Navionics chip.
18533,JPD,2007-01-03 04:01:00,296,"That will be on the other chip Lew that will have all of the smaller and not so charted Lakes on it like Lake Muskoka and a bunch in the Kingston area.  Navionics Hotmaps Premium - code: CANADA	BC, NS, ON , QC 	PREM-C2  JP"
18544,Roy,2007-01-03 05:19:00,13728,I can't see them putting Nipissing anywhere but on the 901 chip.
