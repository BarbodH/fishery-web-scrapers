18336,tonyb,2007-01-02 18:57:00,1637,Frogs? or Brown Trout? hehehe  Tony
18341,fishnsled,2007-01-02 19:07:00,3520,  LOL!!!  Good one Tony.  It's too bad that he couldn't get a closer shot but they are frogs.
18374,jediangler,2007-01-02 22:35:00,1923,"Joonmoon & I went to Guelph lake on New Years day, and caught a frog while searching for lures in the stump fields. He wouldn't pose for a pic though. Water was high for January, about six feet higher than in the past. Most of the best snagging stumps were still under water so we didn't find any lures this year. Only the back bays protected from wind had ice, and it was only an inch thick."
18381,GbayGiant,2007-01-02 22:53:00,1780,Know that's funny. Never seen that before.
18382,danc,2007-01-02 22:55:00,4677,That's just crazy.
18384,mrdylan,2007-01-02 22:57:00,111,Crazy year for sure.
18441,Greencoachdog,2007-01-03 00:38:00,8163,"I don't know about the legality of it up there in Canada, but that's some good eatin' hoppin' around up there on the ice!"
18451,Dondorfish,2007-01-03 01:13:00,1000,"As a Montreal Canadiens fan, I did not know what to expect when I opened this thread!  Glad to see the little hoppers!   Don"
18493,pameladallaire,2007-01-03 02:46:00,470,They think it's spring.  Up here the spring peepers call on the ice.  Maybe I should check outside tonight.    Pam
18566,Marc Thorpe,2007-01-03 12:08:00,621,I was gonna say Me and Roy were'nt there
18572,PERCHER,2007-01-03 12:38:00,787,The title sounds like a new Disney ad.FROGS ON ICE.
18590,Bob,2007-01-03 13:41:00,370,"Last time I saw frogs on ice was in the mid 70s, but that was a sudden early freeze at the start of the coldest winter I remember.  Poor frogs were caught by surprise in early October."
18618,Rich,2007-01-03 15:12:00,3927,"If I was there, I would have said, You're crazy frogs. CraaaaaazzzzzzzzyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyYYYYYYYY!!"
