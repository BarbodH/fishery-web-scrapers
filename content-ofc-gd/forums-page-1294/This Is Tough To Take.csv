We only used it for ice fishing, no trail riding.  One of these days I'm going to get an atv. I can use it year round and it will come in handy during hunting season.  A sled is still lots of fun ...... if you have snow."

I miss snowboarding but all that means is that im saving money, so bring on the warm weather, mountain biking and bass fishin!  (but give me a few more months to steelhead)"
18278,charlied,2007-01-02 07:05:00,584,And this is the reason I held off the last couple years from getting heavy into ice fishing and buying all the expensive gear...just bought steelheading gear instead!
