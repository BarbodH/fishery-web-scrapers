18215,mikeh,2007-01-02 01:07:00,824,I was just wondering who won the tourney? and if the final standings are going to be posted? I'd like to see where our team ended up.thanks
18217,bigfish1965,2007-01-02 01:19:00,3382,There will be a preliminary page put up with results this week. But since we know we lost many entries to hackers and to captains 'pursuing other interests' we'll have a window of a week or two for entry recovery.
18229,nofrills,2007-01-02 01:39:00,89,all entries I received for team 5 were entered
18243,irishfield,2007-01-02 02:17:00,26272,Thanks Mike for looking after our team! Now if we could have just got that Crazyhook fella to show an OFC logo in a picture......
