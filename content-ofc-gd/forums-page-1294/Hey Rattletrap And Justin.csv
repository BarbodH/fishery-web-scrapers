They carry that wind breaker.80 dollars.So Im thinking with the exchange and shipping from Carbelas, it,s a good deal.   Have not been to that store since the fire. I really like the lay out.You can tell though things are slow out there.Not a busy place at all.  They will be carrying some baits that I have been looking for,so Im sure another trip will be in order later in the year."
