18617,snag,2007-01-03 15:10:00,1932," I still have no idea of the lengths or weight of any fish. I must have been in the 40"" range on 1 or 2 though. I should have taken advantage of Fidels company to collect scientific data. I even carry a digital scale and tape measure!   Yeah, but you've got monsters up there!"
17477,snag,2006-12-31 03:35:00,1932,"FESTIVE GREETINGS!  Sorry, these reports would have made it to your homes/workplace sooner, but my internet has been down for a few weeks.  O.K. the pics:  These are from my solo journeys: Really had to do some lure variations spot to spot due to light and water quality. Most of the following were caught employing only 2-4 different lures. However, on occasion, I do have a lure that I use to attract them and once I get a follow, I quickly switch up to my closer lure. This combination has been working well lately.       Had a great day with a fanatic that has spilled some great wisdom, Highdrifter. We took advantage of the last “warm” day of winter before Xmas. I almost went topless.  We have a weird chemisty. When ever we meet, Fidel catches a fish within minutes of us meeting and I always close the day with a catch.?? It works when we communicate via cellphone too?  We did a great tour that day. Fidel on rollerblades and I was on a great garbage score mountain bike. We covered a lot of territory on the shore and on the islands. We both lost some fish and had great follows. We even ran into DSN on the ferry. Surprise, surprise.      I was mocked for this pose. Fidel was suffering from Pikeness envy. This beauty was caught at the end of the day   The holidays are definately a time to give and Recieve! This one was a big muddy water suprise.   You should've expected the hat.       No, it's real, not photoshopped. I have integrity in self-mockery.    Well, Merry belated Xmas and HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!!!!!!!!!!!   Love Snag!  P.S. Be good and be nice.  p.p.s Today I ran into fellow OFNer, RSX, at one of my fave spots. He hooked into a real beauty that snapped his line and stole his lure right near the dock. After a good cry we lamented the absence of fellow OFNer, Lucid."
17482,ChrisK,2006-12-31 03:42:00,2772,Well done Snag !!! You certainly seem to have the touch for those Northerns....  Cheer !!!
