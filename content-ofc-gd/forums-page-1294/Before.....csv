First time using the deep fryer and let me tell you it was awesome!    The apron was a Christmas gift that I thought I should break in.  One of the easiest ways that I know how to cook.  Heat up the oil, drink a beer.  When the oil is up to cooking temperature, slowly lower the turkey into the oil, drink another beer.  Pull out the bird and your done!  Next time I think I'll need a bigger turkey because it was done in two beers.  If you ever get a chance to try one, don't pass it up."
