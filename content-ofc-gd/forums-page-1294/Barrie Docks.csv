18147,crappieperchhunter,2007-01-01 22:09:00,2582,I was there today myself. Fished from 10 until 2. Caught about 40-50 perch...no size at all. My biggest was maybe 9 inches and 1 maybe 8 inches...with all the rest being smaller. Never saw any fish bigger then my 9 incher caught while I was there. It wasn't a zoo like I was expecting though so that was a bonus.  I was planning a trip to the eastern tribs for rainbows...but with the rain we got last night I opted for perch instead.  Anyday fishing is better then a day on the couch at home...but man I'm hurtin for SOME ICE !!!!

18193,Fisherman,2007-01-02 00:04:00,7201,"knotaclue: did you find a better spot after you left?  I hung around for about another hour, only got one over 9"" today.  I think I'm finally getting the hang of the ""bug jig"", must have caught another 50 or so, when the wind picked up, I opted for the warmer spot...home.  Nice meeting you."
