18550,JFish,2007-01-03 07:53:00,29,"Nice chromers!  I love float fishing but only on my second year.  Can I find steelhead in many of the rivers and streams around my area (Hamilton) or should I be travelling north or east into the U.S?  I know many areas around me are also closed.  Without giving away you spot CC can u give a general idea of where you are catching them, like north of Toronto or in the U.S, that would be great.  JFish"
