17199,motv8tr,2006-12-30 08:25:00,2587,Good stuff!  Way to go Remo  Maureen
17401,Carp,2006-12-30 23:53:00,1488,"Thanks everyone.  How do I celebrate winning a muskie t-shirt ? Guess I'll have to catch one of the toothy critters when the season re-opens next year.  Hey Wayne, I heard you have lots of pretty muskie lures. If you let me borrow one to catch my celebration muskie, I'll let you wear my t-shirt and hook a fish for you too."
17486,JenTavolacci,2006-12-31 03:45:00,68,"Yeah they are comfy aren't they? I have a 1 of the hooded sweatshirts, great for the weather here! Warm and comfy!  Remo- are we going to turn you into a Muskie man?  Jen"
17548,Carp,2006-12-31 11:42:00,1488,"Turn me into a Muskie man ?  Hmmm ?  I have some gear Jen, but usually hook the toothy critters by accident while fishing other species. Guess I can go after them intentionally. I may hook a walleye."
18316,JenTavolacci,2007-01-02 16:59:00,68,Nothing wrong with that!
18329,fishnsled,2007-01-02 17:54:00,3520,"Congrats Remo!  Now that my health is in order, if you like, I'll take you out for some muskies when the season opens since we didn't make it out last year.  Then you can get that nice new shirt all slimed up.  Send me a pm and we'll get thing organized.  Fishnsled"
18343,Carp,2007-01-02 19:20:00,1488, That sounds like a plan. I'll be in touch. Thanks for the offer.
18432,Pete Maina,2007-01-03 00:25:00,213,"Congrats Carp.  Yeah, you should take your shot at the 'skies ... you'll likely get a monster eye.  Pete"
