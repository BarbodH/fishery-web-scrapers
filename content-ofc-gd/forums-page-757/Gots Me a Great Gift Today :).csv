Robert told me he would ship me some jigs in return and that was all good to me.  Well today was the day.... my wife handed me the parcel when she got home and looked at it and saw ""Beamsville ON""...... I knew right then and there it was from Bruce, got excited and was like a kid at Christmas time.  When I opened the box I was in AWE..... here they are:    A real work of art don't you think??? Thanks ever so much Bruce and Robert.... those will get put to good use, I promise Especially the harness I can envision a monster speck going for this one come next spring Leechman"

408088,bigugli,2009-12-03 14:04:00,6138,I'm glad you like d the trinkets Jacques. I enjoy making them. Sure beats watching WFN reruns at night.   Certainly doesn't tax any physical limitations either  loving those jigs! i'd love some in dace colours for specks...very alike the nipigon jig flies. Doc S: Don't mind tying custom patterns at all. There are lots of variation in dace colours.

408099,NAW,2009-12-03 14:51:00,4022,Those should do the trick just fine eh.  Nice work Bruce.
408182,Leecher,2009-12-03 19:58:00,7832," The trinkets are very well made, I just can't wait to try it One question:  do you make those with 2 blades??"
