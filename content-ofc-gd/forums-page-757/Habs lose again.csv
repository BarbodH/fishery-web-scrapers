408785,lookinforwalleye,2009-12-05 19:46:00,4399, Nice call!!!LOL  Who do you like in the Grey Cup???LOL
408792,JohnF,2009-12-05 20:02:00,3494," It was a very professional effort, although my cynical side wonders how much they paid professionals to orchestrate it. All the same, it came off very nicely. I'm pretty sure it had more than a little to do with Molsons taking over again and wanting to make a big splash. If a rich multinational was to buy the Leafs and wanted to make waves I'm pretty sure they could find people to do just as good a job, perhaps even the same promoters that did that show for the Molsons Habs. We won't get to find out though until they reach 100 years. We might be surprised at how much they throw into their show. After all, they've had the greatest fans in the history of hockey. Who else would stand by their team through all the slumps and dives Toronto has suffered? I saw George Gillette(sp?) in the stands. I couldn't help thinking that the money being spent on the production probably wasn't his.  As for the Habbies being the greatest hockey team of all time (assuming there weren't any really good ones at the turn of the century - circa 1800-1900) perhaps I don't understand hockey. That much ballyhooed survey was apparently commissioned by the Habs and was pretty carefully designed to get the desired result. I heard that on a commentary so it may or may not be accurate. Surveys are unfortunately like statistics - you can make 'em say pretty much whatever you want 'em to say.  If you rate a hockey organization by it's fans Toronto would have to be right up there. If you rate it by what they've done lately, well, that doesn't even need a reply. If you rate them on the most successful licensed product marketing organization I think a lot of people would say that Philly had the best machine for years and still stands as the high water mark in hockey market promo. If you are talking about the team with the greatest number of recognized player names over the years that would probably be Montreal, although that raises the question ""So what?"". They've had a lot more years than most teams to have the stars, but for star power they've been off the grid for years. The other 5 Big Six teams all had their moments with their share of greats at different times. Toronto hasn't really had the great players that other teams have had, but they've sure had some of the most beloved players of all time.  There's no question the Habs have been a great organization in the past, but then so was England once upon a time. It's a brave new world filled with a bunch of kids playing hockey at an incredible skill level. They're retiring at the age most of the great old names were just hitting their stride years ago. Even Ken Dryden seemed to be suggesting that it was time for the Habs to stop living in the past and let the kids do their own thing.  JF"

408355,Jer,2009-12-04 09:23:00,1426,"   Wow...amazing how one of those ""junior B"" teams can thoroughly thrash one of those ""real NHL"" teams..."
408385,blaque,2009-12-04 13:39:00,2419,Sabres hand it to the Habs last night.........They werent even there for the first period.
408403,NAC,2009-12-04 14:12:00,369," It's easy to dislike the Scabs when their ""fans"" start chanting that Bull with 13mins left in the game on Saturday to a team such as Washington no-less.  It was awesome to see Washington come back on them and then see the fans turn on the team.  They haven't won a game since and the ""fans"" walked out on them against the Leafs with 8mins left!"
408409,F7Firecat,2009-12-04 14:32:00,347,We all know the Habs are the greatest franchise ever in hockey past present and future!  OLE O     L      E
408424,Moosebunk,2009-12-04 15:31:00,3970,"Hmph!?!?!?!  A surprising post from you Chris.  From long-winded global warming threads to a short anti-Habs post.   You're changing with the seasons I guess.  If the Leafs fans ever showed an ounce of the ""honest passion"" Habs fans have for their team, then maybe they wouldn't have been a franchise of ""Hab Nots"" throughout history.  Booo your own team... so what???  Praising failure doesn't shape improvement, just look at the Leafs.   Greatest sports Dynasty in the history of sport.  The Habs ain't just about Scientific guessing... they're proven fact.     On a side note... where's Stoty???  I can never find the guy in any fishing threads but he loves the hockey ones."
408458,scuro2,2009-12-04 17:02:00,904,"I post about important things, about major changes in the world. Global warming is changing the world. There appears to be another rift in the time space continuum, the Habs are looking to take over the role of Canada's WORST team. They lost again last night, zero wins in their last 4 games, and they are playing Boston next!!! Bwhahahaa!"
408482,JohnF,2009-12-04 17:58:00,3494," Toronto fans are just more refined. Anyone who grew up in Leafs country knows there's no shortage of passion, it's just the stable kind. We'll know they've achieved Habs fan kind of superiority when they start rioting in the streets.  Here's a little history that's fun to read - if yer a leafs fan.  http://hubpages.com/hub/Toronto-Maples-Leafs-Part-2  JF"
408483,Mike Pike,2009-12-04 18:00:00,1332,Alright!  The Habs are getting bashed as much as the Leafs!  They really ARE Canada's team!!!
408504,JohnF,2009-12-04 18:35:00,3494,"  It's not easy for a hockey team to attract this much love. The Leafs are gonna get jealous and bench Kessel, Blake, Stajan, Hagman, McDonald, etc. That should be nuf with Mitchell & Gunnarsson hors de combat. They'll get the horns back from Montreal fer sure, maybe.  JF"
408533,jediangler,2009-12-04 21:32:00,1923,Just checking the facts.  In the division the Leafs are 5th out of 5 teams. In the conference they are 14th out of 15 teams. In the league they are 29th out of 30 teams.  I can see how all their fans would be excited. Thank Maurice and his Hurricanes. Start planning the parade route.
408535,JohnF,2009-12-04 21:41:00,3494," And the Leafs look like they should be a lot better statistically, don't they? A few breaks in shootouts and one or two less career games by goaltenders and they'd look heaps better.  And I'm sure knowing they're the greatest team in the history of the game (or whatever that poll was) the Habbies will grind out some more wins somewhere down the road and respond to the blind faith their fans have in them. Sorry, it's the Leaf fans with the blind faith. Habs fans are the rational ones who just know their team's the best, and they'll tear down their own town if anyone proves them wrong.  JF"
408568,jediangler,2009-12-04 23:04:00,1923,"Every team has a HOT stretch once in the season, the Leafs are just finishing up theirs now.  And a heads up for those that don't know, there's a special Friday night edition of ""Hockey Night in Canada"" tonight to celebrate the Habs 100th year in the league. Boston vs Montreal at 7pm. It'll be nice to watch a game on CBC, that doesn't involve the Leafs, for a change."
408573,Jer,2009-12-04 23:21:00,1426,  ...only downside is it will involve the Habs...
408580,JohnF,2009-12-04 23:33:00,3494, Think of it as scouting for next Thursday's game. Somebody's gotta be the sacrificial lamb. Might just as well be the Habbies as a winner.  JF
408603,Roy,2009-12-05 00:13:00,13728,HAHAHAHAHA Only the Canadiens could get Aragorn to introduce the flower power on the ice tonight.....what a great presentation.
408604,Roy,2009-12-05 00:16:00,13728,and now Gordie Howe is on the ice introducing Jean Beliveau.
408605,JohnF,2009-12-05 00:17:00,3494, Jeez. They drafted Gordie Howe.  JF
408606,Roy,2009-12-05 00:23:00,13728,two elders are coming out now....the oldest...Emile Butch Bouchard and Elmer Lach from Saskatchewan
408611,JohnF,2009-12-05 00:34:00,3494," Man, if the young guys don't skate their asses off tonight, there's nothing'll ever get them going. Nice ceremony.  JF"
408621,irishfield,2009-12-05 00:53:00,26272,Too bad their gonna lose to take the glow off the whole thing.....
408624,jediangler,2009-12-05 00:59:00,1923,I'm not a Habs fan but that ceremony was done with more class and dignity than I think any other franchise could pull off. Even getting Gordie Howe to help the old guys out onto the ice without falling down. He should have put on the Richard jersey and snuck into the photo.
408628,JohnF,2009-12-05 01:10:00,3494,Ken Dryden's comment in the interview with Roy et Lafluer was interesting - about laying off dwelling on past successes and letting the new players find their own identity. He says it puts unfair pressure on today's team.  JF
408655,JohnF,2009-12-05 03:17:00,3494,"The Habbies don't exactly suck tonite, huh? Nice way to bounce back.  JF"
408781,Squid,2009-12-05 19:11:00,1656,"Well it was a class act all the way. What a dynasty!! 15 stanley cups in 23 yrs, more players in the hall of fame than any other team, 24 cups in 100 yrs and the habs dressing room recreated in the HHOF, in TO to boot. yeah they suck right now and are playing like plugs from Junior C but they played with emotion and passion last night. The Montreal Canadians are the greatest hockey team in the last 100 yrs, all true hockey fans will acknowledge it. Whoever argues this point is a hockey fan that does not understand the game of hockey. I totally agreed with Ken Drydens comment about the pressure on this young team. Let them find their own way, they will surprise a lot of folks. Carey Price was crazy in nets last night!! He had a talk with both Roy and Dryden. Called them Mr.Roy and Mr.Dryden, too funny.  GO HABS GO FOR ANOTHE 100 YRS!!!"

407606,Leecher,2009-12-02 03:29:00,7832,Yeah tell me about it..... they sucked big time tonight
407609,Paully,2009-12-02 03:34:00,712,I liked the part where they booed their own team

407632,Cudz,2009-12-02 04:52:00,2652,7 wins but 7 overtime losses.  They are fun to watch and it gives us whiners something to complain about at work.
407633,BassAsin,2009-12-02 04:58:00,806,fair enough i suppose. hahah
407634,Greencoachdog,2009-12-02 05:02:00,8163,"Are the Habs the new ""Leafs""???"
407684,Governator,2009-12-02 14:37:00,879,Fact: Leafs got more pts in November than the Habs.  If they didn't start off the season with 8 straight losses they would be in the playoff pack at least.

407716,Governator,2009-12-02 15:59:00,879,"I think the funniest thing of the past week in Hockey was the poll that ""found 33% consider the Montreal Canadiens to be the country's national hockey team""  Sports media outlets (aka TSN) blew it up like it's a pure fact because of their 100th anniversary yet they failed to mention that a whopping 1000 canadians were surveyed lol."
407818,JohnF,2009-12-02 20:10:00,3494, Be kinda embarrassing if it came out they did it outside the Forum before last night's game.  JF
407836,jediangler,2009-12-02 21:06:00,1923,"After watching the game I tuned in to see the end of the Blackhawks vs Bluejackets game. It was like going from a junior ""B"" game to an NHL game. The pace was faster the passing was accurate and there weren't offsides and pucks going out of play every 30 seconds. I really think the NHL needs to go divisional like european soccer. Put the weaker teams down in a lower division and keep the top 16 or 18 teams in the premier division. Maybe then teams would be forced to try and ice a winning team to stay up in the top league."
407840,JohnF,2009-12-02 21:14:00,3494," Us overly tolerant Toronto fans live for those isolated moments when our bumbling hands of stone fumblers stick it to some of those fleet-footed tape to tape paragons. I'm sure guys like Kessel & Kaberle, or last night Stajan, are genuinely thrilled to be allowed on the same ice as some of these real live true professionals.  JF"
407842,jimmer,2009-12-02 21:26:00,2730,I loved it that I didn't have to listen to the fans sing their annoying song when the opposing team is losing near the end of the game.  It was quiet actually.
407858,Roy,2009-12-02 22:11:00,13728,"Hey, cut us some slack guys. We just had  the Grey Cup parade today. One cup at a time ok? Now we'll start concentrating on hockey. Thanks for understanding."
407905,yakpiker,2009-12-03 00:16:00,160,Hey Hab bashers with your Leafs gear...sometimes you win the battle and lose the war.  Enjoy last night's success because only one of these clubs will be in the playoffs this year.

408338,siwash,2009-12-04 03:55:00,683,  And the Leafs won again tonight..  3 points behind and a game in hand for the good guys..  Not that many Leaf jokes going around anymore eh?  I predicted a crappy season for the scabs.. fyi Gomez has 1 goal in 22 games or something like that.. he makes blake look like a scoring machine  Nice pick up Gainey... only $8/year..  How does he hang on to his job? I guess when you win some cups 25 years ago you become untouchable...
