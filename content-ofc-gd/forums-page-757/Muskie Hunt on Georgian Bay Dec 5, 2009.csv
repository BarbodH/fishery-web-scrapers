408937,TJQ,2009-12-06 05:09:00,7806,LOL... thats too much!!   I figgered it was a sturgeon!
408946,scuro2,2009-12-06 06:10:00,904,No head shakes....that one showed you who was boss.
408957,lew,2009-12-06 11:44:00,12766,"Hilarious story Wayne, thanks for a great start to my day  Don't feel too bad about catching the board Glen, I once hooked a monster musky on the Niagara that turned out to be a fisherman in the next boat.......but that's a story for another day"
408958,Marc Thorpe,2009-12-06 11:46:00,621,"Hey Wayne Touch Wood,least you did not hit ROCK bottom"
408959,Roy,2009-12-06 12:05:00,13728,"Wow!   Fishsticks, good stuff! Great report."
408966,bigugli,2009-12-06 13:20:00,6138,A good larf to start my day.  It happens to us all
408977,Spiel,2009-12-06 13:52:00,9065,I can just imagine how this story would be unfolding had it got away some 10 minutes after it was hooked....
408980,Roy,2009-12-06 14:11:00,13728,"Yeah, would'a been tragic had he lost his wood."
408982,Paully,2009-12-06 14:12:00,712,"  That board is big... That being said, verticle holds are bad for boards that large. you really should be holding it horizontal and make sure you support the tail end!!"
408986,Terry,2009-12-06 14:24:00,14456,"I tried to tell him but would he listen  no  just take the picture, he said  no respect for the resource"
408990,Spiel,2009-12-06 14:31:00,9065,He wood knot listen.....
408992,Spiel,2009-12-06 14:35:00,9065,"Perhaps he was ""board"" after he ""saw"" the ""lengthy"" battle.  Lame....."
409198,irishfield,2009-12-06 23:51:00,26272,"Well he's gonna get another ""CRACK"" at that board on Tuesday !!"
408836,irishfield,2009-12-05 23:46:00,26272,"Had Terry and Glen out today for a troll around on GBay. What a great day. -3C at launch time... I think it climbed to 0 at one point and back to -2C at load time. Sunshine for a good part of the day which made it feel a lot warmer.  Now guys... ya can't catch fish if you're spending all your time untangling lines!!! Tune them damn baits would ya...    Glen happy his bait is back in the water..    Terry... I think he's pouting from the scoulding..    I'm smart... I have my own side! lol    After numerous hours ... Glen's heart beat increased immensely, as the drag screamed and the rod bowed over. A short fight and some headshakes and a respectable and FAT 34"" Pike was in the boat... then released for another day. I'll add he was holding onto the rod, at 5MPH, when it HIT !    A couple of hours later... Glen was commenting about how he would really love to have one of those $50 bills Terry ""makes"" and I tell ya.. no more than 10 seconds later his rod screamed and the fight was on. Terry got it all on Video and I'll let him post that before I post the pics of the huge girthed slab we put in the boat.  "
408837,trapshooter,2009-12-05 23:51:00,1234,you're teasing us!!!  Lets see the Lunge!!
408838,Spiel,2009-12-05 23:51:00,9065,"When you own the boat you make the rules.   I'd have my own side too.  I was thinking what a great day it would be to have the boat out, despite the coolness there was little wind to speak of down here and it looks like you had fairly calm winds up there as well.  Can't wait to see the MONSTER."
408840,Sinker,2009-12-05 23:53:00,8692,"Bah.......no pics, no fish!!!  Nice pike Glen!!  S."
408843,kickingfrog,2009-12-05 23:58:00,8333,Nice! I can't wait to see the fish. I bet Glen was COLD!
408845,kickingfrog,2009-12-06 00:00:00,8333,Oh ya. Anybody else tired of paying good money for baits that don't run true out of the box?
408852,solopaddler,2009-12-06 00:28:00,8605,Oh you tease!  Can't wait to see it.
408857,Terry,2009-12-06 00:51:00,14456,       
408861,irishfield,2009-12-06 01:02:00,26272,Not the pike.. come on Terry... the slab !!
408862,kickingfrog,2009-12-06 01:12:00,8333,The pair of ya are fish teases.
408865,Terry,2009-12-06 01:16:00,14456,"and without further ado  I think it speaks for itself   there is foul language so you must be 18 or over  and you must agree that you will not sue, if your heart explodes from excitement....     "
408866,irishfield,2009-12-06 01:20:00,26272,LOL  100 lb +  rough sawn 2 x 10 x 14' long!  
408867,kickingfrog,2009-12-06 01:23:00,8333,"Horn broken, watch for finger."
408868,Spiel,2009-12-06 01:24:00,9065,Buggers!  No worries Glen those Esox Angler mags will be at your door this week and you can bone up on how to do it right.  Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to let Wayne read them as well....
408869,troutologist,2009-12-06 01:25:00,951,Classic!  Good work gents.
408879,glen,2009-12-06 01:50:00,2641,Hey Spiel i landed it didnt I?  Terry remember next time you have to provide the entertainment and the bar is set pretty high.
408882,Terry,2009-12-06 01:52:00,14456,I thought I provided the entertainment the time before.....or my truck did..LOL  it was great fishing with you today
408885,irishfield,2009-12-06 01:57:00,26272,It's all about the laughs Glen!!! I think you know that well by now....  Great day out guys... we should do it again tomorrow! Snow/Rain and 35K winds... naaaaa... maybe Tuesday !!!
