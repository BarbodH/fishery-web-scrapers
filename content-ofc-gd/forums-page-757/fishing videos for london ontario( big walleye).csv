408687,Twocoda,2009-12-05 05:56:00,4130,i dont think he is too worried about it ...its posted on utube...lol...i think he was trying to prove a point that you dont have to leave london to catch fish...see how he feels when there is 1000 people fishing in his hole...
408758,splashhopper,2009-12-05 16:44:00,2931,check the intro on one of his other videos..... Hillarious 
408760,brifishrgy,2009-12-05 17:01:00,559,  good luck finding a spot to fish there next year .. more lurkers will take up the spots and keep all the walleye they catch .... used to catch tons of walleye in the lower grand before someone decided to post all their catches .. now you have to fish with 50 other boats and your lucky to get one in a days worth of fishing
408763,splashhopper,2009-12-05 17:12:00,2931, no worries bri....  since the dam broke last year at Springbank.... the fish have all but disapeared all through the Thames in London.... and what little is left looks like it was born in the sewage treatment plant.
408765,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-05 17:15:00,0,Can't wait to see his post next season......no spot for you or fish.....lol... How much do you wanna bet he found it by accident and now thinks he's the only one .......not for long...
408787,Dara,2009-12-05 19:51:00,3052,  come on now...you have to share the resource..its for everybody.  Maybe a few tourist ads should be directed that way as well
