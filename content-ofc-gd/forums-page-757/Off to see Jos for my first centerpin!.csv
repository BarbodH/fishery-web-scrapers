I called this morning and he said he has over 200 centerpins in stock, so I should be able to find something decent for entry level in my price range.  Pretty excited, can't wait till tomorrow morning to go and try it out.  Good thing I will be fishing alone, so no one can laugh at my efforts!  Will post a pic of my new unit later on tonight or tomorrow.....if it is tomorrow, hopefully the first pic of my reel is with my first steelie as well!  Shawn"
408561,Handlebarz,2009-12-04 23:01:00,3790,I have never looked for a center pin reel before but I know one thing if yer heading to Angling outfitter you will be glad you did hope ya had fun on the trip over there
408570,steelie hunter,2009-12-04 23:10:00,55,He will hook you up with a great deal!  He is the best there is
408666,raptorfan,2009-12-05 04:02:00,126,"Well, he hooked me up with a good deal as expected.....and of course he had to let me know just how green and uninformed I was....lol.  Am going out with them on sunday though, so should be a fantastic learning experience.  Got myself an Okuma Aventa 4 1/2"" reel, fully spooled with upgraded bearings and a cpl other goodies.  Hopefully I get some action tomorrow  Shawn"
408690,Twocoda,2009-12-05 06:00:00,4130,Okuma unless Ozuma is a knock off...with an Okuma you can do a wallace cast....
408694,BillM,2009-12-05 07:06:00,17367,"hahaha!!  Raptorfan, do yourself a favour and put a swivel above your float.  Until you learn the Wallis, this will greatly cut down on the amount of line twist you'll get... And trust me...you'll get tonnes with the side cast"
408709,raptorfan,2009-12-05 13:35:00,126,"LOL. Okuma it is.  Thanks for the tip Bill, will do."
408710,azebra,2009-12-05 13:39:00,168,"good for you, youll fall in love with fishing all over again..I went out yesterday for the first time in 2 weeks, wow. my Wallis cast went all wrong.. you gotta keep at it, maybe its good if there are other pinners out there, maybe they can give you a little tutorial on casting.. I never minded the constructive criticism.it all  helps... all the best!"
408805,fishdawg,2009-12-05 21:42:00,912,its allways worth the drive to Woodstock
