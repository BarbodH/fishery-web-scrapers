408660,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-05 03:44:00,0,the next 14 days looks good. Not for ice though. It'll cool it down quick.  .....it's a start...  http://www.accuweather.com/canada-forecast...ic=1&set=99
408661,irishfield,2009-12-05 03:50:00,26272,Some FINE Muskie weather there my friend...
408730,johnnyb,2009-12-05 14:54:00,3413,"I'm with Terry for 2nd week of Jan. on the big lake.  I was on 4 inches of very fresh ice at BBP last year on Jan. 9th...this year is a little bit behind, but hopefully by the new year, we'll have had enough cold weather to close the gap."

408800,ERB,2009-12-05 21:12:00,35,"Looks Like the temps are going to go down, maybe be on the lake in a couple weeks."
408829,irishfield,2009-12-05 23:06:00,26272,Water is still 42/44 F as of 5pm on Georgian Bay. Suspect Simcoe is similar..
408844,Sinker,2009-12-06 00:00:00,8692,Simcoe was 45 last week.
408846,irishfield,2009-12-06 00:03:00,26272,Yep..so about the same.. GBay was 45.7F last Saturday
