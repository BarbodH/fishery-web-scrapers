408187,anders,2009-12-03 20:19:00,1168,"It can be done!! When the big lake freezes we head out there faster than the leafs lose hockey games.  I have never had fish hit as hard as steel from superior through the ice...absolulty viscious and mean hits...then fight like there is no tomorrow!!  Some guys go small for them, we on the other hand go large...we jig with NK Mags...and hold on!     "
408190,Harrison,2009-12-03 20:27:00,2202, Now that would be something!  If only Lake O would freeze over.
