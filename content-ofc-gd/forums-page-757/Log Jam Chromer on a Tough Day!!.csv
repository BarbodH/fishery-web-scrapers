408817,StoneFly,2009-12-05 22:44:00,574,"It was a pretty Tough Go today, saw quite a few Anglers out,..but not many fish,..so I approached the last log Jam before calling it a day,....I decided to Giver a drift or 3,...not caring if I would break off, so I buried it deep in the Wood,..lol. sure enough..I felt a very light tap and set the hook hard and this pretty Silver Girl came out to play, I locked the reel down with my finger and Began Pulling her out of the Wood,...she was a little stubborn about it though,...just then I lost may balance and landed up on my butt, but luckily I kept the line tight,..so I kept fighting her from the sitting position for what felt like 10 seconds,....(Now I know why the arm chair guys do it in August,..lmao)...when I felt the chance I quickly got to my feet and continued subduing the princess, she really wanted back in those logs,...but I finally landed her, thanks again Mr. FrogHair!!.  Thanks to buddy who took the pic for me,..I think he is from this board,...musta been a laugh watching me fall down and still fight the fish.  Sorry about the quality,..my Digi still aint workin right,..so the pics are Bass Pro Specials.           Yes, I only Caught one Fish,..so Took 4 pics...lol, is that wrong?  Also, I had to add this one,...my buddy and I on a different river,..nothing hitting,..so he did some 'Float' fishing..a different LogJam...lol,...Got 9 in total I think, I was just waitin for him to crash though.    Cheers,"

408889,tibbs,2009-12-06 02:05:00,650," Lol... It sure would.  I had a similar experience...  I remember this year I hooked into a good 10lb fish and I then realized i was knee deep in mud and had no way to escape. It started to run downstream and i had absolutely no control over it. I clamped down on the reel, but it sadly snapped the leader. After i lost the fish it took me a good 5 mins. to get out of the mud."

I've been in a few situations where I've had to fight fish from the seat of my pants and on a couple occasions, from my belly...Earlier this spring, while fighting a fish, I slid into the river and fell onto my butt...Only thing was water began pouring into the top of my waders"
