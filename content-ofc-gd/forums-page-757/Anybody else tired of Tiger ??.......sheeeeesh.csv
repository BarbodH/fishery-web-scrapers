407997,Radnine,2009-12-03 02:52:00,1538,"I think that the worst thing that he could have done is not play golf. No one in the golf circle would say boo to him about it because they know that Tiger would shut them out (media access wise) when all of this blows over. Call me odd but I watched every time he played because I felt like I was watching history, ya know? I hope that I still feel that way when he resumes playing (golf that is....). Prince Charles, President Clinton, Kobe Bryant, if you think about it, why not Tiger? A shame though really, and I actually feel a bit sad for his wife and kids. Jim"
408006,scuro2,2009-12-03 03:41:00,904,"He is a public figure selling products. In my book that makes him fair game. What I want to know is if his wife had to rescue him with a golf club, why bash out the back window?  The guy should do a Letterman or a Kobe, and take his well deserved public lumps. It is the unknown and the unbelievable story that keeps this news item going."

408019,scuro2,2009-12-03 04:06:00,904,  Not good when the Chinese news media has figured it out. This vid shows Tiger's version and then what they think happened.
408147,lookinforwalleye,2009-12-03 17:56:00,4399,  Perhaps the children of world need a better role model obvoiously Mr. Woods is of low moral character and not worthy of any respect what so ever. If Mr. Woods was so concerned about respect and the image he portrays to the youth of the world he should have used better judgement before he started banging skank cocktail waitresses.
408154,kemper,2009-12-03 18:19:00,2232,"I enjoy watching Tiger Woods golf....he is an incredible athlete. After seeing this....I STILL will enjoy watching Tiger Woods golf, because he is still an incredible athlete.  Fact is, I do not care one tiny little bit about the whole story because I don't believe that I (or any of us) should KNOW what the hell happens in his personal life.  The guy is an athlete, not Paris freakin' Hilton...and we are grown men and women not 13 year old girls obsessed that Paris got a new pink collar for her dog.  Tiger isnt perfect (SHOCK. Get over it.  Time to go fishin..."

407653,lew,2009-12-02 13:25:00,12766,Seems like Tigers encounter with a hydrant is the most important event in the world this week cause that's about all any of the news channels are talkin about. Even while I'm typing this they've started another conversation on the radio about it.  Maybe it's just me
407655,Harrison,2009-12-02 13:29:00,2202,"I hear ya Lew.  I guess it is nice to know those who you believe have everything, go through the same crap as everyday folks.  Except my wife would use a flippin stick."

407666,Roy,2009-12-02 14:05:00,13728,"You're right Lew, I haven't the time for any of that garbage either. It's worrisome that the IQ and morality index is so low in the general population that this kind of crap would drive  media sales up. On a more positive note, when I see a 'story' such as this one on the front page of a newspaper I think what a wonderful world we live in that there are no wars, no financial woes, no racism......all is well. All we have today is two morally bankrupt individuals with a crooked golf stick."

407678,Governator,2009-12-02 14:31:00,879,"I'm so sick of it, breakfast television played an audio clip or message off the web that Tiger apparently left on some girls machine.  Who freakin' cares???  His reputation is extremely important to the world of sports, more kids look up to him than probably any other sports figure to date and the media needs to show him some respect for that.  He's not Brittany Spears."

If they want him to cooperate, it might help if they didn't take interviews about tiger on his front lawn.   I would understand it if this were something we are all entitled to know....but tiger's marital or driving troubles (sans alcohol) are none of our business."
407709,packrat,2009-12-02 15:43:00,93,"You can read all about it next week in the ""gossip"" rags in the grocery store.   Plus some additional bits thrown in for good measure.   What really gets me is when they report people who have broken the law who just so happen to be an X whatever player or their cousin third removed. Who cares!  Does this give them special status over the rest of the population?????"

I don't really pay much attention to all that stuff (much as I do enjoy following golf, I didnt see it coming ... Im just not a star watcher other than on the ice or on the linx or on the OFNboard   )  ... but honestly at this time of year I'd rather hear about that kind of stuff than the world ending and banks collapsing and terrorists doing bad things ... maybe its just me but I find it a little less worrisome (and now jeesh what with Meredith and all ..
