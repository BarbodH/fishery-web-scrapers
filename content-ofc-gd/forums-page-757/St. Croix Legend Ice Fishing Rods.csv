408284,Jds63,2009-12-04 00:48:00,1365,"I picked up 2 ST croix ice rods at the BPS last winter, they are great and seem to be very sensitive, not sure what type of fish you are targeting but I was catching lakers and whitefish with them ... just picked up a quantum rod and reel ice combo at Gagnon's today on sale"

Croix ice rod is my Med. Avid series that I jig for walleye with.  Sure wish they still made Avid series ice rods.  You can't go wrong with a Croix though, IMO."
408343,mjack 7,2009-12-04 04:22:00,22,Actually the only difference between the avid and the premier in the ice rods were the handle. The blanks and actions were all the same between the 2. One has a cork handle the avid had the graphite.
