408390,ccmtcanada,2009-12-04 13:58:00,7971,We float for them.  Glow sticks on top of the float so you can see it...and use larger than normal stinky slimy roe bags for scent!  Bright moon helps too.   Paulus...Blys fish were in the report too!!!   Snag...just big ole stinky slimy roe bags...   Thanks ehg...we've enjoyed catching them over the years...lol.
408391,ccmtcanada,2009-12-04 14:00:00,7971, Sounds like a plan Scott!!!  I will be in touch.    Yep..we have thought about it
408441,TJQ,2009-12-04 16:27:00,7806,Wow Cliff... nice pickerel!!  whew...
408456,GBW,2009-12-04 17:02:00,8460,now those are some bign's!
408667,Joey,2009-12-05 04:07:00,9122,I wondered where you dissappeared to Cliff.  You got some good fishing in there even tho work is getting in the way most of the time  Some nice fish there.  Joey
408747,douG,2009-12-05 16:14:00,2693,"Nice to see the stalwarts are still kickin'.  Great fish from Cliff and Carole, as usual."
407495,ccmtcanada,2009-12-01 22:15:00,7971,"It's has been a while since I have posted a report...things have been absolutely hectic since July for me.  Long story short, you may remember I was sent to Beirut Lebanon for some software testing...well, I rejected the code that they presented and that set off a flurry of activity back in Toronto.  So basically, since then I've been testing that same software from 8 am to 4 pm every day.  Since most of my posting is done from the office (and when I test there are people literally over my shoulder), I have not even had a chance to log in...and the last thing I want to do when I get home is look at a computer screen.  Anyhow, our oldest has a new boyfriend...so we have lost our babysitter many an evening so we haven't gone out a whole lot.  The last few times out in the boat returned us with no fish...so we were having a bad streak there!  That being said, we have gone out and caught some nice fish...here's a little photo summary....  Fall Walleye The shore area we fish is completely dependent on a few things...the number one thing being wind direction.  Anything from the south, east or southeast makes our area completely unfishable.  Since we had such a warm fall...the winds from the south stymied us most times we headed out.  Here's our nicest ones this fall...  Bly with a 14 pound 3 ounce one.  Sorry about the photoshop job here...her foot is in the shot for perspective....   Here's one that I caught....can remember how big it was...31.5"", but cant remember the weight.   Trib Fishing Being in the east end, the tribs tend to get a little busy during daylight hours, so we usually head out at night for a few hours here and there.  Actually I haven't even hit a trib in daylight this fall.  Again, since we've lost our babysitter, we've had to take turns out on the creeks.  Here are some shots of Bly's fish!      I prefer to fish early morning on weekends, so most of my fish came before the sun came up.  Once the crowds showed up, I left to head home to spend time with my family.  Some Steelhead....     And my personal best brown trout!!!  It's only 25 inches...but it was a great surprise when I saw it surface during the fight...   And back it went to swim another day....   That's it for now...maybe a few more fish before things freeze up...and heck...if I'm dragged kicking and screaming, you may see a few ice fishing reports from me!!!"
407496,Greencoachdog,2009-12-01 22:25:00,8163,Excellent report and pics Cliff!!!  Gotta love the colors on that Brownie!!!  Thanks for taking the time to post that fish porn for us!!!    P.S.... I hear CT is having a sale on ice augers soon!
