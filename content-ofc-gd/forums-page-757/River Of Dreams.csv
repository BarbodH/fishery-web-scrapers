408600,solopaddler,2009-12-05 00:04:00,8605, Indeed. My hands sweat profusely I need extra holes for ventilation.       When are you gonna join me again?
408601,TDunn,2009-12-05 00:10:00,680,Your numbers are amazing. Beauty of a river with no crowds...very nice!  Fantastic post man!!!!   TDunn
408612,timmeh,2009-12-05 00:34:00,609,I fished that area a bit on Tuesday and only got 1 coho to show for it (pretty sure I recognized some of the spots) I had the chance to go back on wed but passed. Guess that was a mistake.  Anyhow it looks like a fantastic day. So how much do you charge for guiding?
408616,solopaddler,2009-12-05 00:41:00,8605, Coffee and a bit of gas.
408671,Kingsalmon,2009-12-05 04:15:00,107,"You are unbelievable!    Do you ever go out and get skunked or catch one or two fish?  Good work again and fantastic report.  Me and my son went to that creek with the browns that you've done so well at lately and caught a handful of steelies but no browns up at the dam.  Had I known that it was that good up there, I would have gone up as well, but the son would have had a hard time with no waders.    Anyways I'm second in line for the guiding thing if you ever do start something.  Looking forward to your next adventure.  Mike G. Kingsalmon"
408688,highdrifter,2009-12-05 05:57:00,2534, When I can make it out to where you are brother..  soon!!  Until then I rely on the unwaveing faith that this nonsense with the mto will end..

408492,JohnF,2009-12-04 18:17:00,3494," Dickhead!  I just mentioned this to my wife. Her response - ""Sure. why not?"" - but after all these years of marital bliss I have learned to pay close attention to the subtle nuances of inflection and intonation underlying her most benign responses. The words unsaid were something like ""Sure, go fishing, if you care nothing for the family jewels."" She might have inflected & intoned ""cojones"" in deference to the upcoming winter sojourn but it all means the same thing, and it makes me squirm even thinking about it.  Besides, you'll have yer hands full keeping BillM out of trouble.  JF"
408495,solopaddler,2009-12-04 18:21:00,8605," Have you ever heard the expression ""it's easier to apologize than it is to ask permission?""  No worries though, there'll be other opportunities."

408500,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-04 18:27:00,10439, PANSY!!!!!  
408501,JohnF,2009-12-04 18:27:00,3494, I hope so too. For this trip though you'll have to be the one laughing at Mike. I'll be home taking care of all the little bits 'n pieces.  JF

Seriously, today I suspect he'd stay home to do chores.  I could change, but then I'd be less a man. That should be translated into latin and hung above my door.  A real man isn't afraid to be seen giving in to his wife. The abuse we take from the lads is nothing compared to the heat SWMBO can rain down on our submissive heads. Of course a real man is seldom seen fishing but he also doesn't spend the better part of his life walking around with his hands cupped lovingly over ""the boys"".  Bravely cowering JF"
408517,ccmtcanada,2009-12-04 20:40:00,7971,WOW  That's all I can say..  WOW!

408588,Harv,2009-12-04 23:46:00,19,"Ya, Tuesday was a tough day - NO ONE on the river caught fish that day - EVERYONE caught fish on Wednesday - just one of those things!!!  One thing is for sure - there will be no more of those reports!!   Still no need to be naming rivers!!!  Thanks for deleting the post Bill."

408436,Spiel,2009-12-04 16:11:00,9065,"Oh boy, it's been a while since I last splashed around in those waters but knowing when and where to be on that river can result in a spectacular number of hook ups.  Of course I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.  Congrats on another stellar day of chrome."

I do not wanna see any more of yer friggin' inflammatory artsy juxtapositions of tree-lined trails and roiling rivers salted with fish porn. If this keeps up I'm gonna have to leave early for Cancun. I'll need a beach fix to wash yer fishy dreamscapes from my mind. Besides, the ladies in Cancun are prettier than yer stinkin' feesh. I realize yer fish are topless too, but somehow it just ain't the same.  I may well go home and break my virgin 13 footer into little bitty pieces, toss it in the bag with all that oh-so-perfect-just-the-right-brand-and-size-still-in-the-package terminal tackle, don my nifty SoloPaddlerWannabe fingerless gloves and chuck the whole dammed mess in the garbage chute down the hall.

408470,JohnF,2009-12-04 17:28:00,3494," It's probably misleading to refer to any of them as ladies. As for age I'm not always certain as my eyes keep sliding below the neck for some reason. Some are easy to recognize as on the elderly side but yer eyes tend to then be drawn back above the neck, or away out across the water as like as not. All that being said a nice degree of lasciviousness can offset a little aging in a woman. But fetchingly lewd & lascivious works better in a smokey bar.  Any time you feel the need to introduce a newby to the mysteries of floatfishing just let me know. It may not be happening soon though as my wife has me booked solid for the rest of this week. Then business obligations have me in Toronto and otherwheres until next Thursday evening. Then we leave for Cancun just before New Years and won't be back in Canada till February.  I may have to settle for getting my fish fixes vicariously for the next while unless I get my butt out and dive with the sharks & eels while I'm down south.  JF"
408473,rock34,2009-12-04 17:35:00,215,"I cant even tell you how jealous I am.  That is an incredible day. I have never caught 8 steelies in a day let alone in my first 9 casts.  If you ever need a partner let me know....anytime, anywhere! Obviously youd be doing the teaching!!  Cheers and thanks again for an incredible report."
408475,JohnF,2009-12-04 17:44:00,3494," Trust me, if Mike was to call today and suggest a trip to the river I'd jump thru hoops to make it happen. My problem is I have a wife and business associates who will all be looking to neuter me if I drop the ball any time before next Friday am. The scariest is my wife. The rest are just executives and politicians, no one really threatening.  JF"

408478,Spiel,2009-12-04 17:56:00,9065,"  I'm sure that Mike is not making this a limited time offer John. Whether it be next spring or next fall, just take him up on the offer when you can. I guarantee you'll devirginize that float rod on your first outing with Mike."
408479,solopaddler,2009-12-04 17:56:00,8605,"    Wayne, that was pictures of myself and Paul wearing the blaze orange. We took it off when we started fishing."

A mutual friend called him Tues evening and told him that a very good source had fished the river on Tues and caught one fish. Said don't waste your time. So Bill bailed....  I never let other peoples lack of success act as a barometer for my potential choice of spots.  Hope ya learned your lesson!  "
408489,asdve23rveavwa,2009-12-04 18:12:00,2690, Agreed...I almost prefer not to hear about somebody elses day on the river I am going to fish...the anticipation is half of the fun...also no false hopes or expectations.
