I'm interested to see what wildlife comes into the yard but also I want to use it for security purposes.  I haven't had any problems but my closest neighbor has had issues with theft and even vandalism.  If anyone comes on the property I'd like to have a picture of them and their quads in the act.  I know nothing about those trail cams.  Do they make noise or emit a flash when they take pictures?  I need something that won't draw any attention to itself, or I risk losing the camera as well as whatever else is laying around."

409297,ch312,2009-12-07 03:47:00,1590,i have a moultrie 5mp inafred. it makes no noise at all and emits no light when it takes pics. as long as you can hide and secure the camera good enough nobody will have a clue its there. the model i have also takes quality video clips...possibly best for your uses
