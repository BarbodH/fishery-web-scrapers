408771,yakpiker,2009-12-05 18:01:00,160,I watched the ceremony on cbc.ca and really enjoyed it.  The number of Habs stars that participated was amazing.  And it was cool to see the old guys take the ice for a warm-up.  Hopefully that is the end of this extended celebration and the current players can focus on winning more games.
