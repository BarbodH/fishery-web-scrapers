408377,FLEX ROD,2009-12-04 13:20:00,394,"All the best to your dad, may it go smoothly and the rehab go quickly.  As one who has been on the table 15 times in 15 years for joint related issues, he will feel great when it is behind him. My mother in law had a femer replaced at the age of 89 and the next day they had her on her feet and walking, 2 months later she felt 100% better.  FLEX"

When I go for my check ups I see the people that did their exercises and were up and about fast did alot better than the ones who didnt . Tell your pops good luck , hopefully no more limping and a end to the pain ."
