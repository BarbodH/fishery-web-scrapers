408949,Swan_Dive,2009-12-06 06:48:00,46,As a former colt that is great news!  Hope they go all the way this year!
408978,Cudz,2009-12-06 14:06:00,2652,When did you play?  The colts are fun to watch.  I find myself watching them on Rogers local cable when there are NHL games on TSN.
409005,jjcanoe,2009-12-06 15:13:00,744,"Make that 14 more to tie the record!   Go Knights Go!   In the 2004–05 season, the Knights broke a CHL record, going 31 games in a row without a loss (29-0-2). The previous record of 29 games, held by the 1978–79 Brandon Wheat Kings (who went 25-0-4 during their streak), was broken with a 0-0 tie against the Guelph Storm on December 10, 2004. The streak ended at 31 games after a 5-2 loss to the Sudbury Wolves on December 17. (From Wikapedia)  jjcanoe"

409078,Cudz,2009-12-06 19:01:00,2652,Wins and not losing are two different things.  Old non-shootout records included ties.
409119,Swan_Dive,2009-12-06 20:33:00,46,"My first year with the colts was 01-02 the year we went to the finals and lost in game five to erie and I played two more year with 03-04 being my last season with them.  For Dr. Salvelinus, I was actually drafted to the soo and played my under age year there, just loved the city and my billets but ended up geting traded after my first year.  Don't really keep tabs on either team but if I had to pick one it would definately be the colts!!"
409176,JohnF,2009-12-06 22:55:00,3494,"I think the hockey I enjoy best the last few years is the world juniors that starts on Boxing Day. It's really disappointing that we leave for Mexico around New Years and they think sport begins and ends with American football at our resort and on Mexican TV, at least at that time of year.  JF"
409181,misfish,2009-12-06 23:02:00,29133," Right on there John. I would never misit .Even book days off to watch, when it,s the morning games.  It,s nice to watch the boys play at home(Canada),then I can save my holiday days.LOL"

409201,NAW,2009-12-06 23:55:00,4022,"I think I have some sort of colts curse.  I've been to about a dozen games, and only seen them win once.  If I go to the next home game, that'l break their winning streak for sure.  Getting the father in-law tickets to the next Hounds/Colts game in Barrie as a christmas gift."
