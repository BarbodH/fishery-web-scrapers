409159,rbaquial,2009-12-06 22:22:00,968,"Ok,  So I was browsing the internet (Criagslist to be specific) and came across a posting claiming they will give you 3000+ channels all for a 1 time fee price of $49. It peeked my interest, because I am one of the few and unlucky that DO NOT have WFN. So this had me thinking... Has anyone heard of such a thing? If you have it, is it worth it? Does it work for regular TV also? Is there a certain # of  TV's that this will work on around the house? or does it ONLY work on PC's with a TV-TUNER? etc... etc...  Here's the website: http://www.tv4pc-canada.blogspot.com/  I am no way affiliated with these guys, I just wanted to know what/if people have had this service before.  Thanks! A2F"

Most stream and feeds get shut down because F1 management has a team that seeks out free feeds and shuts them done almost instantly. Only the very private ones survive a full broadcast."
