180664,Maverick,2008-04-02 23:12:00,371,"I would go with Helly Hansen. They acutally specialize in outer wear. I've been using their jackets for 5 years now, winter and rain. Couldnt be happier. I would definitely pick HH over BPS or Cabelas but I am sure they all will keep you dry."
180692,Joey,2008-04-03 00:25:00,9122,"Well we got our US ordered BPS bibs and pants the other day and I must say I'm quite impressed with their quality.  Have not field tested them yet, but will update once I do.  The zippers are a little tricky, but that is because they are waterproof.  Gotta be careful and zip slooowwwwww!  Joey"
180705,Roy,2008-04-03 01:03:00,13728, I love when you say that.....
180717,douG,2008-04-03 01:24:00,2693,"Ok, the question is, do I buy 50 $ gear every 24 months, or 200 $ once every 10 years?  It comes out the same, or even cheaper with the cheaper gear when you consider the time cost of money.  On the other hand, I would rather use the good stuff.  The difference in purchase price is covered by interest for those ten years.  I would gladly pay the 10 $ per year interest on the difference to wear the 100 mph or shimano gear over the less good gear.  Who wouldn't?"

180922,JohnAB,2008-04-03 15:05:00,178,"I have bought two different styles of waterproof outerwear from Wal-Mart. First was a complete set of camo in saddlecloth. Bought new in 1996, still wear it today and nothing compares to it. Soft feel and can stand in the shower all day and not get wet. Cost about $200 total. Last year bought a set of Remington cloth pants and jacket. Cheap to buy at $120 on sale total. Works very well as well and well built. No problems at all.  Have dropped $400 on a set of supposed waterproof camo from Natgear. Might as well wear nothing at all as the water just goes right thru it.  Work supplies us with a fancy $500 set of goretex outerwear. Both sets I have had are not the best. Will leak a bit especially around the crotch. I have never had much luck with goretex."
181666,Canuck2fan,2008-04-04 17:14:00,1444," I might on a splurge spend 200 for the 100mph suit but since it lists for 119 for the paper thin jacket and 169.99 the light bibs in my size so the total to my door is today 366.82 US. That is WITH the bibs being clearance priced..... SO that is almost double your 200 bucks....  For that I could buy TWO HH compact suits (with all the same properties as gore tex but without the cost)I believe that HH is with respect to quality as highly thought of as whoever made the MPH for basspro (who knows maybe they went down the same assembly line in asia) so that should be a wash. Or even better for the less coin I could do this. Buy one HH compact suit for above freezing temp wet weather and a remington 5 in one jacket and insulated pants during the yearly wallyworld clearance for about 40 bucks less total. I expect the same wear easily out of the either of the TWO suits I buy that you will get from yours.  I have a couple of other advantages though I would not need to layer up under the remington combo in even the coldest part of winter. I have been out in mine when guys in their 400 dollar plus survivor suit were crying it is too windy too cold, my suit is frozen, or I can't get up or walk blah, blah, blah.... I am always warm dry and toasty. Now if we both went in the water they would probably survive better but I ain't going in the water in this lifetime so it doesn't matter to me. Another advantage is when or if one of my suits gets damaged or stolen I still have the other one. So to me in the end I got a THIRD suit the frogg togg for the same price you paid for your one ""quality"" suit in todays dollars. I can keep the cheapie in the car all the time just in case and not really worry about it at the price I paid. However if I was keeping a 100MPH suit in the car and it got stolen I would freak because with a 500 dollar deductable I would be eating the cost of the loss myself. (in the past 3 trips I have made to fishing holes guys are talking about car break-ins and equipment being stolen.... seems like the new way for the druggies to make a quick buck around here anyway) Just once I would like to catch some loser at it though....  BTW Gore tex is not a brand of attire or even a manufacturer of any type of clothing it is a technology available to any garment maker for a HUGE fee. Now when you can find gore tex this or that on the internet for less than the price of a meal out, how big a selling feature will it remain? As to it being all that for quality I disagree. I have a buddy who insisted on getting a gore tex coat for camping.... 2 1/2 yrs later and it was no longer waterproof. I have bought used cars for less than he paid for that jacket that lasted long as well.... According to the store it must have been his wife washing it every week to keep it nice and clean for him that ruined it LOL. That was only funny because he only camped 5 weekends a year...... but she wanted it fresh for him to go though...."

181853,Billy Bob,2008-04-04 21:36:00,5865,I have Gore Tex hunting parkas from Cabela's that I have spent the whole day duck hunting in the pouring rain and was warm and dry when the day was done. I also have had a pair of Cabela's Gore Tex hunting gloves that leaked on the first time I wore them but when I called Cabela's they immediately sent out another pair at NO CHARGE and didn't even want the defective pair back. Now I don't know if they treat me like that because I have been a loyal customer with them for almost 30 years and I do use their credit card but because of the way they have ALWAYS treated me when I have had a problem with something I purchased with I will continue to mail order from them. I don't need some customer service rep telling me there is nothing they can do after I plucked down a hundy or two on some outdoor gear. Believe me you can't go wrong ordering from Cabela's

182160,wacky tambaqui,2008-04-05 04:41:00,33,"  MrEh,  I think you'd be making the best investment imaginable in getting yourself a Gore-Tex suit for some of the conditions you're thinking about subjecting yourself to, and I speak as a former marathon runner who has worn Gore-Tex wear in this application unrelated to the main topic of this discussion board.  In Northern Ontario the weather is hostile a lot of the time. Any athlete living in such parts and needing to keep the required levels of physical fitness to do it competitively in the outdoors has to find means to meet the extreme conditions and at the same time minimize risks and discomforts. Gore-Tex has proven itself since some time in the 1980's as having the ability to wick away/evaporate excess moisture even in the wettest conditions besides making an excellent windbreaker. OTOH it seems to stop functionng after 2 or 3 seasons; when it starts to fail, you'll know it. I don't know how long it will last in your application but human sweat seems to speed its deterioration. A sweating athlete is one thing, an angler just dealing with hostile weather is another.  Personally, I haven't shopped for Gore-Tex wear lately but the best I can suggest is to shop around and decide what your budget / needs will allow, and whether you want to get that fancy-schmancy ""Brand X"" or get something else made with the same thing but ""gets the job done"".  I hope this helps. Test it out in that miserable weather and let us know how you make out.  "
408705,scugpg,2009-12-05 12:46:00,1373,Has anyone heard when the BPS suits might go on sale in Toronto? I can't find a comparable suit in London anywhere so it looks like BPS or online at Cabelas is the only option for a gore-tex suit

408717,cranks bait,2009-12-05 14:20:00,721,"I too mountaineer and ice climb.  I use that gear for fishing year round as well.  I have a Mammut jacket and Marmot bibs.  They are both going on more than ten years old.  I have never been wet.  The outer material is very tough and durable yet not bulky or over heating so it is comfy to wear in the summer as well.  What you want to look for is taping throughout the entire product not just at the shoulders and stuff.  At least a double stiching to give durability and longevity to the product.  Arcterex is another great brand.  Although they tend to be a little pricier because they are made in Canada, or they used to be at least."
408719,Bob Devine,2009-12-05 14:24:00,251," Mike, since you are close to Michigan try Cabela's Bargain Cave for Cabelas Guidewear. In many cases guys have used it for a wk and returned it because that was their plan. You will save $$ in the Cave I have BPS 100mph jacket and Cabelas bibs, just don't like being a billboard for BPS. Cabelas has small writing that does not look as gaudy. IMHO"

For my money ... I love my honkin bright yellow WETSKIN Hurricane suit (XL Bib and jacket with hood)... I look and feel like a true Newfy fisherman ... not only will you be able to find me if I fall overboard, but I am always the last one off the water in the worst cold/wind/rainy weather ... especially now that I have my new fancy matching wide rimmed hat which prevents the rain from running down the back of your neck ....(that was worth the extra few bucks for sure)  "

408754,mistaredone,2009-12-05 16:33:00,913,"  Just because the zippers are taped dose not mean they should be tricky.  I have had many taped zipper/seam jackets over the last decade in many different brands like H/H, North Face, Mountian Co ect.  All will keep you dry but comfort and user friendly is key.  My choice for next season is a Columbia light rain jacket for summer months I picked up at BP for $89 really confortable.  Neopren sleves are manditory for me early and late season but not for summer use.  One other major factor is when you zip the jacket all the way up make sure no material is rough on your lip, chin or nose.  If its any kind of bother after a few minets it will drive you nuts after hours in the wet and cold.  Hope this helps"
408761,cranks bait,2009-12-05 17:07:00,721, A little trick on the zippers Joey is to wax them.  I usually forget until I am out with my coat.  I have personally used lip balm on several zippers and it works well.

I did buy the lighter duty BPS gortex suit this summer as the Jacket I bought was way to warm for summer rain I would sweat in seconds this fall I would wear the BPS bibs and my caballas jacket and was never cold or wet.

Best rain gear I have ever worn, perfect for letting air in and water out with different wrist and ankle adjustments. Also, the oversize hood keeps the rain off. Not sure if it would be the best suit to use while fishing shallow water but I seemed to still catch fish while shining above the water line.  Canadian Tire sells them, $149.99"

I will be using it from spring to fall so I dont want anything that is to heavy lined that I will roast in the summer. I was looking at Caballas and Basspro any info on what you all have or like and why? I do think I want bib pants from what I have read they are a little more comfy.
174466,Joey,2008-03-21 12:21:00,9122,"Funny enough, we just researched and bought the ones from BPS.  We both got the Pro-Qualifier pants.  Paul went for the Bibs and I went for the regular ones.  On an intresting note, it was about $200 cheaper to order from the US, even with Shipping.  If we get charged Duty and Taxes upon delivery, it will still be about $100 or more cheaper.  If you want to wait until we get them, I'll give you a full accounting of their quality.  Joey"
174468,Rich Clemens,2008-03-21 12:27:00,3131,"I picked up a Gore-tex suit from BPS last year which included the jacket and pants, but I don't recall what we paid for it.   Very lightweight, breathable, and did the job.   The front of the jacket zippers  and there is also a flap that you can snap to help cover up the zipper.  I got mine a tad bigger than my normal size to allow for a more free movement while on the water.  I only had the opportunity to use it a couple times, but was very pleased with it.  I selected this one based on other's comments and that it was made of Gore-tex material.  Folds up nicely and stores easily in our boat."

The material is actually a woven polypropylene with a knit so tight it won't let water in but loose enough to breathe for wicking away body moisture.   I've tried Gore-Tex rainwear before and wasn't as pleased as I am with the Froggs.

It may be good to try it one and be happy in the standing position,  but go sit and squat to make sure there's room enough for the family jewels and other parts, and, room enough to put on a fleece or sweater under it on cold days.  Better a bit loose than looking like a knackwurst ready to explode."
180510,Canuck2fan,2008-04-02 18:56:00,1444,I just ordered a frogg togg Pro-action suit on ebay and I will let you folks know how it works.... It seems more like paper than cloth but for 38 bucks delivered to my door I couldn't resist. It is light and obviously breathable as it was about 85 in the apartment (forgot I had cranked the temp when my loser landlord thought it would be OK to turn the boiler for the building off last night because it had been hot during the day....) when I tried it on and I would melt in about 10 seconds in my Viking it that kind of heat..... the phone rang and I answered it and talked to a buddy for about 10 minutes about when the earliest we could hit the tribs this weekend would be forgetting I had the rainsuit on. In that heat wearing my full delivery uniform and I never broke a sweat. Could be interesting if it holds up to the wear and tear I will be putting it through.  I will definitely post the results.
180602,Handlebarz,2008-04-02 21:05:00,3790,I have read alot of the reviews on the Frogg Toggs and I hope they have made changes to them it seemed alot of people were having the same problem or maybe they just ordered to small suits that would cause the ripps? I still have not decided on what to get but I think it will still be gore tex.
180605,Canuck2fan,2008-04-02 21:09:00,1444, The one I got is HUGE I wanted something that I could wear over my fishing vest and a warm jacket. NOTHING bugs me more than fishing in the rain and having my vest on the outside and getting it soaked.... All three sets of my rain gear were purchased with that in mind. I figure if it lasts for a year at 38 bucks versus 250 for a gore tex that I would get 5-7 years out of I will be ahead of the game...
