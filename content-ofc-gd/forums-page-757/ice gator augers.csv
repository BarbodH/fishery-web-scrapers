409258,irishfield,2009-12-07 01:43:00,26272,For that money... I'd buy a gas auger and be done with it.   25 holes.. we'd have to come back in by 9am !

Buy a 10"" gas auger if you want dependable and a large window to look down...lol. Im not sure about you but on a bad day I will drill up to 30 holes just for myself to find good fish. Usually up to 4 people out with me...that's way to many holes for an electric."
