407422,POLLIWOGG,2009-12-01 19:10:00,835,"We tried to run courses this fall but couldn't get anyone interested in them, people would rather pay twice as much to write the test without the course."
407437,I'mHooked,2009-12-01 19:42:00,525,Gauge me potentially interested.
407442,[emailÂ protected],2009-12-01 19:58:00,290,  How much were you charging for the course lol.  I paid $25 online for my test.
407527,vinnimon,2009-12-02 00:00:00,2593,39.95 for me on line with a extra card.
407603,POLLIWOGG,2009-12-02 03:26:00,835,I think our course is up to about $45 with a  Canadian Power and sail Squadron membership for a year. To challenge the test without the course was $20 but I think it went up a little. We had a bunch of people lined up for a course but they all wrote the test at the fair for I think it was $60 or $80.
408153,Roy,2009-12-03 18:16:00,13728,"I think that most of you know how I feel about the boaters' card concept. It just wasn't one of their better ideas. HOWEVER!  It is the law and everyone must have one if he/she is to operate a motorized boat. Prices vary from one place to another. Sure you can get the test done online but if you're going to be paying for it anyway why don't you get full value for your money. In my opinion, the boater's card test will teach you next to nothing. Go to a place where you can meet the people teaching the course, talk to them, ask questions, learn something which might be specific to your home waters. You can try the Canadian Power and Sail Squadrons. This thread was started by Peter who is a part of the Town of Oakville Water and Air Rescue Force (TOWARF). These guys know what they're talking about. Heck, get  a few OFNers together and make an evening of it! Learn something. Make it worth your while.  I'll ask Peter if he can post the next scheduled date.  Just my humble opinion."
408163,BITEME,2009-12-03 18:55:00,1968,Next Course will be December 14 2009 from 1800-2200 it would be nice to know ahead of time how many are interested lets say the cut off is December 10 2009 Looking foward to hearning from you  Peter
