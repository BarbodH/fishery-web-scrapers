408814,Cudz,2009-12-05 22:29:00,2652,"Simcoe Bait and Tackle in Barrie has new owners and a new name.  It is now called ""Rack and Reel""  and it has a small hunting section (mostly bows).  The lady I talked to was pleasant and her name was Penny.  They still have minnows and stock hasn't changed too much. There is an ice fishing corner.  I love Bass Pro like the next angler but I really try to support my local shop too.  I hope it goes well for her."
408819,Fisherman,2009-12-05 22:51:00,7201,Opens for business bright and early at 0600.
408820,misfish,2009-12-05 22:53:00,29133,"May have to make a visit.  Magic word,,,,,,,,,,,,,,pleasant ."
408895,Scott S,2009-12-06 02:23:00,203,I'm going to miss all the signs that were in the store!!!! Scooter
408967,Cudz,2009-12-06 13:24:00,2652,Right.  6am to 7pm.  Good hours for sure.
409046,Rizzo,2009-12-06 17:04:00,4754,"Good stuff. Glad to hear it stayed as a fishing shop. I know ""Sweet Lou"" could rub some people the wrong way but I never actually had a problem with him. Happy to continue supporting the local retailer. If they only add a musky section and keep some bigger minnows through the winter I could really support them!"
409076,Cudz,2009-12-06 18:59:00,2652,She told me she had the big sucker minnows and crappie??? for musky for georgian bay.  Not sure what crappie means.
409085,pikeie,2009-12-06 19:10:00,380,Well im glad to hear they finally sold the place! Congrats Lou and Joanne!
409128,Terry,2009-12-06 21:07:00,14456,The Rack and Reel so I guess she has nice reels but does she have a nice rack  it had to be asked
409190,misfish,2009-12-06 23:37:00,29133,"When I get back into town,I,ll let ya know."
409205,Fisherman,2009-12-06 23:58:00,7201," How be I send her your address and she can come over and give you a sized 12 mitt in the chops, she's a nice young woman and I wish her business the best."
409209,NAW,2009-12-07 00:04:00,4022,"I stopped in a few days after she opened, while the floor was still half empty.  At that time she was talking about carrying a local bow manufacturer.  A guy from Stayner area who makes cross bows, and maybe some other styles as well.  Not to sure on the details."
409212,misfish,2009-12-07 00:20:00,29133,  Interesting.
409215,Rizzo,2009-12-07 00:34:00,4754," the last owners had big minnows too, but only in the summer (when I didn't want them). Hopefully new owners will have decent sized pike bait in the winter"
409222,misfish,2009-12-07 00:51:00,29133, Jacobs is just a coffee drive away.No offence to the new owners. MAYBE THEY WILL HELP OUT THIS SEASON.
409231,backbay,2009-12-07 01:03:00,773,"I liked Lou. Now, I didn't shop at the store all that often, but found him to be great anytime I was there. I wish him the best. In terms of the minnows, I think there's one guy with the majority of the wholesale business in the area. (Name escapes me). Just guessing, but when there is demand for stock, maybe it makes a difference if the store owner in question has a good relationship with him."
