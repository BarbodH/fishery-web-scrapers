408610,trapshooter,2009-12-05 00:34:00,1234,Congrats on a great year!!  Looks like the new boat got a workout - lots of different lakes and great multi-species action.  Well done!
408776,fish-miester,2009-12-05 18:49:00,864,Awesome Report! I thought I did well.. i guess I'm wrong!
408155,gone_fishin,2009-12-03 18:21:00,481,"Well, i guess it's ALMOST that time of year to put away the Softwater gear and start looking forward to the Hardwater season... I've still got at least 1 more trip to the BoQ planned before things ice up though.  anyways... on to the good stuff...  Winter 2009 provided some awesome Simcoe Lakers and Whities...      Also got into some good multi-species action out on the BoQ...        couple eaters...    and of course... the fish of a lifetime!      On to the open water... Some GTA Pike action...            Then i decided that i had enough of shore fishing all the time, so i bought myself a boat...            Lake Scugog Crappies... i guess we wont be able to take a feed like this anymore... now with the limit of 30.      BoQ / Lake Ontario Pike and Walleye...                                  Some more Quinte Country fish... multi-species...                                      On to the Mighty Musky...          "
408156,gone_fishin,2009-12-03 18:22:00,481,Sparrow Lake... Birthday Weekend... Multi-species...                More Musky...        Some Scugog Bass...        Back to Musky...        Stupid Stony Smallie    Rice Lake Smallies              More Musky...                      And.... my latest BoQ Walleye...        Throughout  the Softwater season i kept track of the Musky and Walleye that i  caught... i am up to 55 Walleyes (not including the ones caught through  the ice) and 18 musky... didn't bother counting bass or pike...  i fished more than 20 different lakes this year also.  Hope you enjoyed the pictures...

408177,perchslayer666,2009-12-03 19:49:00,280,1. The Pats suck 2. At least someone was having luck at the docks in the Well-Well 3. Nice report.
408181,MCTFisher9120,2009-12-03 19:56:00,3761,"That has to be one of the best seasons if not the best for yourself. So many decent to good sized pike, musky,catfish, and bass. You deserved it, fish like that requires lot's of time out on the water for sure.  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
408183,spinnerbaitking,2009-12-03 20:11:00,1622,"Looks like you had a tremendous year, nice photo's Thanx For Sharing Richard"

408402,JohnF,2009-12-04 14:12:00,3494,"I'm a little concerned that we haven't heard from Dawg since these pics got posted. I have this vision of him prostrate on the floor in front of his computer hyperventilating from the overdose of fish porn. Is there anyone living near him who might be able to turn at least avert the screen from his view, give his over-taxed fish-loving heart a chance to slow down?  JF"
408431,Fishing 24/7,2009-12-04 15:52:00,709,spotted musky FTW!
408485,gone_fishin,2009-12-04 18:03:00,481,"Thanks Guys! It's been an awesome year to say the least!!! me and my buddy explored a lot of new water, and caught fish on most, if not all of the lakes we fished!  Now... BRING ON THE ICE!!! I've got a new Power Auger and Vex to try out!!! LOL.    There are some monsters in there... just wish i could find them in the winter... LOL. the ones in my pictures were between 13 and 14.5 inches... so, probably around a pound and a half or so...   if i remember correctly, you are a Bills fan (unfortunate)... but i'm coming down to Buffalo to see the Bills/Pats game on the 20th of this month... Can't wait!!!  GO PATS GO!!!   Will do buddy, maybe we can hit the ice again this winter!   That's the funniest thing i've heard all day!!! HAHAHA!!!"
