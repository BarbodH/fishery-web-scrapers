Little spec on a homemade go getter.      I have no idea what this is, but it's different.    This plant is incapacitating if rubbed on bare skin! I felt something burning through my jeans..powerful stuff. I think it's a stinging nettle.    Baby bow. Single barbless hooks are a must! He looks suprised doesn't he? haha    Greasy chub.    I'm ending the report with a fish tale. I get a huge bite, feels like a heavy walleye, fight him for 5 minutes...then...this perch comes in, pushes the walleye OFF my lure and gets a mouthful of hooks! My arm length is proof of how big that walleye was.  "

In my case, I was only uncomfortable for a couple minutes. I made sure to study the various plant species during the winter knowing full well I was going to be crawling around the trout streams on my hands and knees or worming my way on my belly.  Poison ivy and stinging nettles suck.LOL"
