511904,Muskieman,2010-10-14 21:59:00,2472,A bunch of us Northern OFC'rs are looking at getting together for a Winter GTG on Nip ... probably on Callander Bay... I have permission from my wife to bring the 30' camper out onto the ice for a few days.  Who's in ?   let me know by posting and I will try to get the ball rolling ......  Randy

511969,Nipfisher,2010-10-15 01:48:00,2449,"Randy, I'm in 100%. I had a few responses via P.M.s. The consensus is that middle - end of Jan would be best with best fishing. Even without the Mallard we could have a blast. You and I will sit down for a coffee or a beer sometime soon and sort out some details."

511992,Muskieman,2010-10-15 02:59:00,2472,  sounds good to me!!!  any more Northerners want to sit down over a few beers/coffee and discuss this?  Randy
