First of what a beautiful lake this time of year. There are some awsome cottages out there.    We lunched the boat at carveths marina on the south side of the lake off stoney lake rd. With lots of warm sun and just a little wind. I had a hit almost right away then that was itfor a couple of hrs. Talked to some other fishermen they said they had been out all morning and only had a couple of small largies. We did end up with a couple like this.    Anyway this is a great looking lake and i will have to try it again next summer
