512490,blarg,2010-10-17 14:10:00,289," Surely using gill nets on the lake is an appropriate management scheme and the hired biologist has no conflict of interest what so ever...  Yes, we all could do better, but gill netting the lake will never be a good idea, never, what is it that people don't understand about that.  You really believe the natives on the lake care more about the fish and less about the money than you or I would?  How foolish of you, that very idea is paternalistic romantic garbage, it is an insult to them.  They are no better or worse than us and it isn't about us making up for the wrongs our ancestors committed, this is about sensible management of the fishery and gill netting a lake is never a good thing.  You could argue that catch limits need to be reduced, the number of ice fishing huts need to be reduced, etc etc etc, i would agree, but how many others would when gill nets are catching anything and everything that swims?  Where is the incentive for anyone to reduce their catch under those circumstances?  I know for a fact that more people are keeping more fish as a direct result of the increased netting on the lake, the prevailing attitude is if they don't have a slot size why should I, it is an honest and reasonable question."
512491,blarg,2010-10-17 14:15:00,289," The most obvious and easiest of solutions was not to voluntarily allow the sale of the fish when a food fishery was already in place, clearly selling the fish (legally, it was already being done to a lesser extent illegally) was going to increase the netting and the pressure on the fish.  Perhaps they would have won that right in court, I don't know, but the current government didn't have to give it away.  Aside from that there are many things that could be done on our side, reduced limits, higher license fees and better enforcement come to mind.  Those are more global than local issues though."
512502,Billy Bob,2010-10-17 15:09:00,5865, YES
512504,scuro2,2010-10-17 15:15:00,904," If the natives are doing studies then they may very well be looking to see what is sustainable. Instead of being ""rebels"" I'd suggest working with the all the people who have rights on the lake for a common solution. That might take some work."

512521,scuro2,2010-10-17 16:36:00,904, We had a thread on this exact same topic before and it seems like every several months there is a thread on natives. This endless rehashing of grudges..what does it do? I'd like to hear the native position. I'd like to hear communication towards a solution.
512525,bigcreekdad,2010-10-17 17:41:00,546,Gee.....I was just wondering if anyone else had a bad stretch on the French.
512579,Billy Bob,2010-10-17 22:10:00,5865,"United, we stand a chance of renewing the fishery. Divided, the fishery falls....nuff said....."
511542,jedimaster,2010-10-13 15:39:00,3472,"Why not fill the french with asian carp, that may stop the natives from netting."
511550,Bernie,2010-10-13 16:25:00,3190,"No, no turnover. Not a lot of fish to speak of either. If there were as many in the French as there used to be why would they travel many miles to get them now? Sorry Raf, honestly wish you were correct in your judgment...but you are not."
511560,Marty,2010-10-13 17:23:00,873,"That water is tough if you're going there for the first time or if you have't spent a ton of time trying to learn it.   We do okay, some years better than others.   The slot is definitely putting bigger fish in the boat.  There are areas where I fish that consistently produce a daily limit of walleyes.  However, some days are just slow.  We move on to target other fish and the smallies and largemouth aren't tough to find when the walleye bite is slow."
511561,jedimaster,2010-10-13 17:24:00,3472,"The problem as I see it, is that native tribes used to be somewhat migratory in nature in that they would hunt/gather/fish/live in areas where the animals were. In a land as vast as Canada is, this would allow one area to be depleted, then moved out of, then that depleted area regenerates. This of course would happen over hundreds of years. Since this is no longer the case. Specific areas are being decimated. Of course I could be totally wrong. As for Natives not taking more than what natures balance allows, thats a load of crock to anyone that choose to believe that horsewash. I have been approached many times by natives to buy pickeral by the bushel. Every one with sprear and or net marks on them. It would be nice to believe that everything is in balance but the reality is far too much fishing is being done in certain presured areas. Eventually what will happen is people will need ot apply for a fish tag similar to a deer tag. You want to fish? everything will be catch and release. You want to keep one you need to buy a tag for that species.  I don't know what will happen or what the answer is, and neither do any of you. Most certainly though almost every lake and stream has fewer fish in it than ever before. Even for species that are generally not kept by the every day fisherman, like Bass."
511563,jedimaster,2010-10-13 17:29:00,3472,"One thing I have always thought that would be a good idea. Is to have an insentive program for those that want to help rebuild fishing areas. Open up privatly funded Fish restocking programs, and allow people to donate to them and give them a free fishing license. EG, you can buy a nomral fishing license from the Gov't or you can give 50 dollars to XYZ corp BoQ restocking programme and you get your license that way. This would be a good way to get people to be putting back to the area and the species they prefer to fish. I dunno though, but the current setup doesn't seem all that effective. I would think lower or 0 limits are on there way much sooner than what people think."
511569,Billy Bob,2010-10-13 18:23:00,5865,  The problem is NOT those who are fishing with a rod & reel but those who are fishing with nets......
511573,jedimaster,2010-10-13 18:36:00,3472, True but those with nets are nt going to be the ones restricted when the fish are all but gone now are they.
511731,Guest swiss,2010-10-14 06:32:00,0,"Whenever I see stories about fishing is never used to be as good as it was back then, I can't emphasize enough that instead of putting the blame on the fishermen, I would say put the blame on the lodges. After all, they are promoting photos of people catching walleyes, pikes, and bass (often getting kids to pose beside them) on stringers.... in addition the lodges often have cleaning huts/facilities to clean what you caught. Imagine the impact that would have on potential fishermen to fish up there and keep what they catch.  As a result I've heard poachers who keep all walleyes even those not on the slot size and they don't really give a damn because all they want is to fish, smoke weed, drink beer, and have a good time. That is really sad, because they are keeping fish more than they need for that day's dinner."
511734,sauce,2010-10-14 08:35:00,219,"Its really something to sit here and read all these different opinions. Blame it on the natives, blame it on the weather, blame the guys that keep every fish they catch. Bottom line is that playing the blame game does nothing. To me, the problem/ solution is very obvious. If fish aren't given a chance to spawn, the population will dwindle. Make sure every generation gets a chance to spawn. The big fish will be tough to find. But as long as there's young mature fish in the system, there will be babies. Get rid of the slot. Convince the people netting fish to use bigger mesh and allow smaller fish to live a year or two longer before being harvested. My two cents."
511744,blarg,2010-10-14 11:53:00,289,"I have only been here 4 years, in that time the fishing seems to be getting worse, the weather hasn't been great aside from this year, and this year the water has been low so who knows if that has had an impact.  One thing is certain, this time frame coincides with commercial fishing on the lake on a larger scale then what had been happening.  I know this is hard to accept for some of you, but netting a pile of fish out of a lake, including a large by catch that is wasted, tends to mean that there will be fewer fish in the lake.  I know, It's a difficult concept for some."
511753,Andy,2010-10-14 12:34:00,330,"There are numerous problems mentioned in the previous posts, and they all have an impact of some kind. The nets are obviously a very significant part of the problem. But it's not the only issue. I've had friends tell me of fellows I know going up and completely ignoring the slot. Enforcement is minimal (not the COs fault) and they get away with it. I've heard of Americans going up to the French and returning home with coolers full of fish year after year. You can't tell me the lodge owner doesn't sometimes know this is happening. I work with a guy whose has fished for years and considers himself a sportsman. He was talking about bringing home a cooler of fish when he was on a trip with only a few guys. I mentioned how this was posible with poss'n limits. He said that he and his buddies were each allowed to catch and keep 6 fish for every day they were on the lake and so that's what they did, thus the cooler full of fish. I couldn't believe it! I told him that's not how it worked and he claimed ignorance. Funny how we don't talk about fishing anymore. The real issue to me is that no one wants to take responsibility being part of the solution. The guys ignoring the slot may say it's OK because the natives would net the fish anyway. The guys ignoring the limits would blame somebody/something else in an attempt to justify their own actions. I'm afraid it's human nature to justify your own actions because of someone elses behaviour. As far as solutions, I think it all starts with the individual fisherman deciding to do the right thing all the time. After that, I don't know. Just so many stakeholders with conflicting interests, and so political as well. Not encouraging. My 2 cents. Andy"
511764,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-14 12:55:00,4399,"I used to fish the nip 20-30 years ago and we had no trouble catching fish,some days they were practically jumping in the boat,the areas we fished always had nets in the water. I don`t know if the natives are the problem but I can say this if native netting is the cause of dwindling fish stock then tough luck for everybody because there is not a politician around with the stones to stand up to the natives we all have seen many examples of that."
511770,Billy Bob,2010-10-14 13:35:00,5865," Andy, I know you intentions are good here but most if not all is all hearsay. Don't believe anything you hear and only half of what you see and nobody will make a fool out of you.  With that said, you seem very concerned with the sportsman slot limit on the walleyes....now that is a joke.... think about it. You and me are out fishing on the Big Nip for walleyes and all we catch is slot fish so we continue to release said fish. Some are injured but still returned to the water. Some will die and be wasted unless you are cormorant or sea gull. The rest very well may be caught in the native's gill nets and be sold for profit. But you and I have nothing to show for a family dinner at the end of the weekend unless on the way home we purchase some from the natives which may be the very fish we let go. So instead of keeping say 4 fish each we may have killed many more than that and they were eaten by the birds while the natives pounced on every walleye they could gather for $$$$$ with NO CONCERN of the fishery.  It the train of thought by the powers to be (Ontario Fisheries) is that a lot limit is a MUST to maintain or improve fishing on the Big Nip by sportsmen who are very limited to fishing with one rod/reel, then how can the same powers to be allow every walleye to be netted for a profit.  BELIEVE ME, it's not the sportsman's fault that the walleye fishing on the Big Nip is at a all time low and may even be near collapsing. A lake of that size should NOT be gill netted for commercial use. The same thing happened to Lake Erie with the Blue Pike (now extinct) and almost with the walleye until all gill netters on the USA side were bought out and banned. Now Lake Erie is one of the best walleye fisheries in the world.  Bob Bob"
511774,chrispyke,2010-10-14 13:54:00,51,"Solutions:  1. Pay the natives the amount of money they would get for netting fish and have them stop netting. (How much could that be per year $10,000  $20,000  $50,000  $100,000)  Money should come from resort owners and fishermann.  2.  Have a CO on each section of the French enforcing slots, limits etc...(Most fisherman and not meat keepers would welcome seeing a CO on the French...I've yet to see one since 1990.  Again the $50k - $70k salary would have to come from resort owners or special licence to fish the french.  Would you not pay an extra $50 - $100/week dollars to fish the French knowing the nets were gone and the fishery was protected and enforced ?  I would.  I know it's dillusional and a pipe dream but I would like to see it happen !!"

I find the fish move in the French more so than other systems i've fished and thus harder to pattern them, but every year, it seems to get tougher and tougher to get good numbers, where as in other systems, the more experience i get, the more fish i put in the boat. Its getting harder to make the decision to go back as the scenery is so beautiful!!  I believe that netting DOES reduce fish numbers, even if done only once in the spring..."

510623,BillsTheBassMan,2010-10-09 17:44:00,932,I was talking to a buddy of mine who works at a tackle shop about the French earlier this year.  He said the main problem with the French is that 7/10 people who came into the shop saying they were heading up to Georgian Bay were fishing the French River.  Just TOO much pressure.
510635,Bernie,2010-10-09 18:55:00,3190," As a kid, over 40 years ago, there were a lot more people fishing. Tourists were everywhere, fishing lodges were always full. Yet the fishing remained excellent. About 10 years ago or so, something changed, I will let you figure out what. Now the fishing here is dismal in comparison. And don't believe what the so called expert reports say. It's a crock of baloney. If the present trend continues the fishery will be over for everyone on the lake."
510640,bigcreekdad,2010-10-09 19:45:00,546,"  Bernie  What happened 10 years ago?  I started fishing the French in the early 90's.....at that time the upper FRench out of Casa Blanca Lodge. Used to take my sons up in June, and we always caught walleye. Satchels Bay in particular would yield many of them up to 7-8 pounds. Sometime in late 90's the walleye fishing took a nosedive. I hve no idea why, other than locals would tell me the Indians would take them over quantity limit and out of season. I fish out of Crane's now, in the section below Chaudiere dam. I don't even fish for walleye specifically anymore. I was at Crane's 3 times this summer and caught 2. I have heard from regulars who fish that section of river that the Indians net walleye below the dams during spawning season. That certainly has to have a significant effect.  In any case, Bernie .....share your thoughts."
510658,Bernie,2010-10-09 21:24:00,3190,"OK, until this point I have remained somewhat silent about the Nipissing debacle. I pretty much live on the lake on an island here and have done so for 53 years. I pay attention to what goes on. I don't fish as much as it is so frustrating now.  Sorry to upset anyone but the truth needs to be heard at some point.  Nipissing has a fairly large surface area(873.3 km2). While most of this area can harbor fish of most species, pickerel stay mostly in areas of feed, rocky shoals, sandbars and weed beds. These are the areas where the fish are easy to target, especially with the use of modern equipment such as sonar and GPS. Yes, sometimes you see reports of a member here doing well, but believe me, there was a time when it was easy to do, even without the use of fancy gear. Just go to your favorite spot and catch dinner.  The lake has had fisherman on it for over a century and the numbers have been sustained for a good many of them. In recent years ice fishing has seen a significant increase in the numbers of fish huts located on these areas. But this has taken place after the most significant decline in fish numbers (according to me and my experience, not on the ""experts""). Summertime fishing is a mere fraction of it's past. Even on long weekends on the main lake you have to look hard for another boat.  There was a time that netting did not take place at the south end of the lake as it was too far to travel and there were enough fish to sustain the small amount of nets that were used near the reserve. But an increase of nets soon brought the French River fish population down and they soon started in other areas. Netting is usually done at night. Treaties were made in a time of no motorized equipment and technologies. Why if times have changed can we also not change the context in which these agreements were made? They have a person who ""looks after"" fish populations and they report all is well. This person is paid by the natives? Fox in charge of the henhouse the old saying goes. What really gets me is each Spring, the natives have a ""moratorium"" and stop netting for a couple weeks. Thing is, the ice is breaking up and it is difficult or impossible to net anyway, but it creates a feel good story in the local newspaper.  Netting in oceans is depleting populations there, how can we reasonably expect that a small freshwater lake can sustain it?  Ok, you asked for it, there it is in a nutshell."

510921,chrispyke,2010-10-10 23:47:00,51,"I've always heard the stories about netting.  Most guides I've taken on the French have said there is netting by natives.  It is sad and repulsive !  What voice do we have ?  If the owners of these million dollar lodges and resorts all along the French can't petition politicians to stop netting, what chance do individual fisherman have ?  The resort owners have a lot more to lose financially than any individual fisherman.  Why isn't more done on that end ?  The resort owners have told me the French is stocked every year.  The skeptic in me doubts that very much.  Last year I stayed on the Hwy 69 to crooked rapids section of the French.  I asked ahead of time if we could fish for walleye.  He told me walleye are very hard to find...almost like an extinct species !!  I've done ok personally with a lot fewer walleye, as I love the scenary so much.

We, however, did not target walleye but were happy with multiple takes of large/smallmouth bass, perch and pike. We were able to raise a few muskie but, unfortunately, no takers. Water levels were down approx. 5-6 feet and the rice beds were non existent but tourny size largies were taken from under boat docks and weed shores in the main bay. Smallies were abundant wherever we found weed/sand/rock breaks. All our fish were released. 20 to 30 fish days were common. Though we had success we do believe the mentioned netting and seeing a trend where virtually every fish caught was kept have contributeed to dwindling fish hook ups."

I've been going to the French for 6 years running now, summer and fall, and have NEVER had it as slow as this.  I don't think i will be back, even though i have caught pb fish of all species there.  On a side note, not sure if it means anything, there was a blue-green algae bloom when we were there, not sure if that affected the fishing at all.  K.S."

511430,bigcreekdad,2010-10-13 01:25:00,546,"  Give us your insight....explain what you mean by adapt. I'm not trying to be a smartass, just intersted in your thoughts/ Also, I'm familiar with turnover, but water temps ranged from 57-61 degrees, so I don't think turnover had taken place yet.Thanks/"
