512089,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-15 16:33:00,3761," That's why we include pictures. Share the baits, an tactics it took to catch the fish aswell as a short story and that's all we need.  Great post and thanks for sharing, MTBF"
512093,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-15 16:44:00,70,"Nice muskies man ! And about giving spots on posts, it's the author's decision i totally respect fisherman who don't tell their spots because the word might get around and for every so called ""fisherman"" out there that keeps everything and anything the spot might be done for ! There's lots of people that ask me where I fish, ussually i just invent a lake or tell them it's another lake and send them on a goose chase!! Especially when it's """"fisherman"""" that keep everything! When it's a catch and release REAL fisherman i will tell them if they ask politely!!  There's not as many good spots anymore... Sometimes you gotta keep your mouth shut once in a while  Don't forget to catch and release!"
512095,Guest swiss,2010-10-15 16:54:00,0,"  I would never even consider calling this thread a fishing report when it's clearly not. It's a short story more than anything else. Since you're the root admin, I'd like to say that these forums are way disorganized, mixing off-topic fishing, family, and random reports with fishing stories here and there.  Anyways, I'm sure I'm not going to be missed, I played by the rules.... say what you want, they were entertaining. Still not what I'm looking for in a report though"
512096,Spiel,2010-10-15 17:02:00,9065, While you seem quite capable of quoting the rules can you quote the part that states reports must include location?  If you're looking to be spoon fed go see you mother! For now find another place to troll. Bye Bye.   
512097,Rod Caster,2010-10-15 17:03:00,5784, Then go fishing and post one yourself.
512098,Spiel,2010-10-15 17:06:00,9065,   That ain't gonna happen......  
512100,Devious,2010-10-15 17:19:00,49," Sorry this ""report"" didn't live up to your expectations. Ill be sure to post as ""Muskie Pictures"" next time so this can all be avoided."
512102,bigbuck,2010-10-15 17:25:00,2449,"He's a troll looking to stir up trouble. Don't pay him no heed, if he's ignored he will go away."
512108,solopaddler,2010-10-15 17:45:00,8605,  You definitely won't be missed.
512115,corvette1,2010-10-15 18:00:00,1765,nice skis congrats
512128,Abberz,2010-10-15 18:48:00,140,"Swiss  Fish were caught on 40 acre shoal in the St. Larry.  Bring a tin boat and come in Nov or Dec.  As for skills, our crew posts trophy fish pics of crappie, bass, walleye, pike, muskie and numerous trout...you name it, we've caught it. Blind luck only goes so far. Do your research and go have fun fishing, I know we do.  Funny how it takes an entire forum to get on you to finally say ""nice fish"" instead of ""my I ask why even post a report?""  You're right by the way, you're not the dick here, It's gotta be us for sharing pictures of nice fish we caught. Our sincere apologies. As Dave said, next time he'll post ""Muskie Pics"", but I'm sure you'll still conjure something negative to bring to that thread as well.  Limp Lines there LOSER!  CJ"
511602,Devious,2010-10-13 20:07:00,49,"Hello OFC - Been a while since ive posted a report. I hope everyone had a great summer fishing and are now enjoying the joys of the fall!  Anyways Ive got a few musky pics here, most are recent with two being from the summer.   This is me with one that was 38-40 cant remember - August 2010   Jeff with a 38   Jeff with a 40   Jeff with a 47x20....notice the pattern here   Chris with a 50"" - July 2010  Were going back out this weekend so I hope to be back with more pics soon!"
511609,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-13 20:38:00,0,Very nice!! That 47 incher is a pig!!!! Was that 50 incher caught in the kawarthas?Thanks for sharing.
511643,Rich Clemens,2010-10-13 23:27:00,3131,"At 47"", that's quite the impressive fish. Glad ya had a great season"
511644,Devious,2010-10-13 23:35:00,49," No it was not, none of these are kawarthas fish."
511677,Abberz,2010-10-14 01:30:00,140, Personally I think the 50' is more impressive....no bias either. Plus that 47 was caught with a guide wasn't it?
511690,muskymatt,2010-10-14 02:20:00,2608,sweet!
511692,fishnsled,2010-10-14 02:24:00,3520,VERY NICE!!
511730,Guest swiss,2010-10-14 06:18:00,0,"May I ask what is the point of a ""fishing report"" when you never tell us the location? I thought the point of a report is suppose to be how the fishing went at a particular place, otherwise it would be just another fish tale."
511743,spinnerbaitking,2010-10-14 11:46:00,1622,"That 47""er is beautiful & I like the pattern on the second fish myself Richard"
511745,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-14 12:13:00,2690,"Very nice, I can almost smell the ""eau de la musky""  Good luck this weekend!"
511748,sauce,2010-10-14 12:23:00,219,"I have no idea who this ""devious"" guy is, but I fully respect his decision to keep quiet on the location. Those are some nice fish. I bet that if he had posted the location, someone else would give him a hard time about it. I'm super jealous of those 2 big ones. Awesome fish!"
511749,danbouck,2010-10-14 12:25:00,4380, 
511750,danbouck,2010-10-14 12:26:00,4380,Beauty Fish!
511755,jbailey,2010-10-14 12:36:00,866,wow nice fish! that 47 is faat
511775,Rod Caster,2010-10-14 13:57:00,5784,  at least he posts reports.  Nice musky you got there. It was a successful season I'd say.
511799,Abberz,2010-10-14 15:24:00,140," Yeah our pictures sure look like fish tales don't they?  Tell you what, maybe don't be a dick next time, pm one of us and we might give you a general location.  Sorry we didn't include the gps coordinates in the thread so people can hammer our spots."
511841,Whitemikeca,2010-10-14 18:20:00,138,Nice fish guys!  Thanks for the report.
511844,BillsTheBassMan,2010-10-14 18:26:00,932, This is the member formally known as JaeteriusZero.  He flamed me for not posting locations in my reports and told me to not post reports.  I guess he's oblivious to reading the stickies here that state WHY we're not allowed to post specific locations.
511872,johnnyb,2010-10-14 20:37:00,3413,"Well done, guys....those are some great fish!  I love how Jeff's expression changes when he bumps up to the 40"" class  "
511918,kerr,2010-10-14 22:23:00,77,"if these clowns told you where they were caught, you would'nt believe em anyway, good fish dave and jeff  , chris not so much"
512006,Guest swiss,2010-10-15 04:05:00,0," Wow.... just wow.  I did ask politely about why you even call it a ""report"", and instead you called me a dick about not posting the location. This thread has ""bragging rights"" written all over it, as far as I know a report is supposed to tell us about how the fishing went in a body of water at a particular point in time.   Obviously you bypassed about all of what I said and still don't know what a ""report"" is in our private PMs. By the way, the conversation was very civil and I don't really know why you considered it flaming. Maybe because I had the last word on what is otherwise a civilized private debate on this matter? Oh, since you're still on that subject and swore by the rules of these forums, let me quote specifically from the rules of the forums itself: "
512008,irishfield,2010-10-15 04:09:00,26272,Damn I love Muskie reports.  Next the guy will be draining the engine oil out of your truck and sabatoging the outboard.
512013,Spiel,2010-10-15 08:57:00,9065," I would never even consider asking for location on an open forum, it's just plain rude!    Nice fishies Devious."
512081,jbailey,2010-10-15 15:41:00,866, agreed.
512088,Devious,2010-10-15 16:26:00,49, Your way off base in everything you said man.
