512189,mercman,2010-10-15 23:28:00,7054,crappiest weather i've seen in a while.High winds and torrential rain. Weather sposed to be better tomorrow on the river.what effect will this kind of weather have on fishing once it calms down.
512190,Roy,2010-10-15 23:31:00,13728,"Shouldn't be too bad on the river tomorrow, Paul. It'll depend on how much floating weed we have because of the wind. I just got hydro back after 4 hours. Are you heading out tomorrow?"
512196,mercman,2010-10-15 23:48:00,7054," yup, gonna go see if i can get that pike i lost last week. we got into it just before 5pm so i'll probably get on the water around 3"
512198,Roy,2010-10-15 23:50:00,13728,"If you want the pike Paul, go between 10AM and 4PM...they hold banker's hours. After 4 at this time of the year is a fluke."
512199,mercman,2010-10-15 23:54:00,7054,"  i'll give her0 next season once i'm set up with the proper equipment, i'd love to get out with you for muskie....hint hint...."
512217,Whitespinnerbait,2010-10-16 01:07:00,2038,"They cancelled the Smallmouth Tournament in North Hately  ( Lake Massawippi )  because of the weather  Oh well , next weekend its back on.."
512220,Roy,2010-10-16 01:14:00,13728,   Are you doing that one?
512239,spinnerbaitking,2010-10-16 02:32:00,1622,"Off to Simcoe in the morning for a Clubbie, 7 boats I think, we'll see what happens, my boater & I haven't been on the Lake this time of year & not much any time, any tips before 4:30 am would be Appreciated, we'll be launching out of Barrie Richard"
512263,darsky,2010-10-16 10:24:00,586,I dont think the river will be fishable. Huge flow and the color will be toast. Big winds for the next few days too. Be careful if you go.
512269,Whitespinnerbait,2010-10-16 12:04:00,2038,  Yes Sir....
512274,mercman,2010-10-16 12:36:00,7054,"  thanks darsky i'll be watching the weather carefully before doing anything.the laprairie basin is usually sheltered but when the wind is from the north like today, it pushes against the current and piles up the water.if i go i'll do the south end of some of the islands"
