He knows of the Thames and Fanshawe Lake but does'nt know where to fish from the shore in those areas? He'll have his gear with him and would also want to go in a boat with someone if theye were willing to take him. He is a good fisherman and a great guy. He is willing to fish for anything but trout. He is 35 and his name is Rob. He is in several pics that I have posted but is not a a board member because he is not a ""computer guy""."
512320,splashhopper,2010-10-16 18:12:00,2931,does he drive?
512346,Nipfisher,2010-10-16 19:59:00,2449,Yes he will have his vehicle but doesn't want to drive too far.

512413,Nipfisher,2010-10-17 00:54:00,2449,Thanks Dutchy. If you and Ron could get him out while he is there he would really appreciate it. His wife has some medical apointments down there and he will have alot of free time.
