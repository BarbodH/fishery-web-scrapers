About 100 tagged perch have been released into Kempenfelt Bay, giving anglers ample time between now and the spring of 2011 to catch themselves a free entry into the festival, which runs Sept. 23 to Oct. 2 of next year.  One has already been turned in to Penny Curtis at Rack N' Reel (formerly Simcoe Bait and Tackle) on Innisfil Street, in Barrie, where all tags are to be handed in.  The festival, organized by the Rotary Club of Barrie-Huronia, will feature a planned prize board of both cash and merchandise, estimated to be in excess of $50,000, including a grand prize estimated to be in excess of $10,000 cash value. Daily prizes will be awarded for up to 100 tagged perch with a minimum value of $100 to a maximum value of $2,500.  Rack N' Reel's Penny Curtis said she is ""excited"" about the upcoming tournament and expects a lot of interest from her customers.  Kathleen Trainor, executive director of Tourism Barrie, said the festival will be a big economic boost.  ""Fishing is big business. About 1.27 million anglers fish in Ontario each year and these anglers spend more than $2.5 billion annually on fishing-related expenditures,"" she said. ""Barrie is the perfect location for a fall fishing festival and a great opportunity to showcase our spectacular lake on Barrie's beautiful waterfront.""  The festival will close at exactly 5 p.m. on Oct. 2, 2011. Rotary organizers are hoping it will eventually compare in size to that of the Orillia Perch Festival and Owen Sound Salmon Hunt, which attract close to 6,000 anglers annually.

510001,Fisherman,2010-10-07 14:05:00,7201,"This is going to be interesting, no problem launching, where to park, hopefully they will think ahead not to close off Lakeshore Dr for the charity runs.  Maybe they can go run up the old railroad trail instead.  I think is would be a good event for Barrie."
510003,kickingfrog,2010-10-07 14:17:00,8333,"It does look interesting, this is the first I've heard of it, but since it is a year away there is still lots of time for them to get the word out."
