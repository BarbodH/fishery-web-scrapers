My bro got big fish of the weekend trolling, paddle measured at 51"" and very thick. Any estimates on the weight? Happens to be his first ski too lol  My best wasn't taped but estimated at being a thick 42""  My other buddy got a thick 43 or 44"" as well but dono if he wants his pic up.  The bite was on at the same time both days and weather was cooperative.  Will be out again last week of Oct. and will hopefully update my first report!  All fish released healthy.  Djeep     "

512674,ctdd2006,2010-10-18 02:14:00,531,Good thing for catch and release cuz that tank would have sunk your tinny!!!  Awesome stuff!!!
