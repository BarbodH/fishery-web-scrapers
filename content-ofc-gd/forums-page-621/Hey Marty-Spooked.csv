I saw 20 juvenile turkeys, 2 Toms, 2 Does came bounding over the fence and across the runway and the highlight of the day...an 8 point buck that I actually had to beep the tractor horn at 5 times to get him out of my way in the centre of the runway. He must be horny if he's after the Zetor as well..."
