512114,Billy Bob,2010-10-15 17:57:00,5865," Yes, things have changed in NYS as well but also NOT for the good...my point is the more they charge us for something that should be a right the LESS we get from them. And that includes Ontario AND NYS...or maybe it's just a view from a Redneck like me...LOL  Billy Bob"
512120,Billy Bob,2010-10-15 18:17:00,5865," The MAJOR portions of the I-90 NEW YORK STATE THRUWAY has ALWAYS had a toll on it....there is a small FREE section of the I-90 (NYS Thruway) that extends from Lackawanna, NY to Williamsville, NY (about 8-10 miles) but that's it...there is no way you ever drove from the PA line to Utica, NY without paying tolls.....and I'm with you that we shouldn't be paying the tolls as they were suppose to come off in 1996 but as usual the politicians screwed us again. However, the tolls on the NYS Thruway is Pocket Change compared to the 407 in Ontario...and back in the early 70's the exchange rate was not 10% on the Canadian favor but rather 4%....you see I live right near the border and use to live in Crystal Beach for the summer months....my sister still owns a cottage in Pleasant Beach, Ontario which is just down the road from Crystal Beach...but you are correct when you say the exchange rate had been in our favor between 50-60%....most I ever got was 57%....but I still don't see how any of this justifies the Outdoor Card that gives you nothing in return. At least on the NYS Thruway you got to drive FAST without any red lights..  Bob"
512123,capt bruce,2010-10-15 18:27:00,820,"Billy , no not gonna be sucked into this , see Ive learned to behave . Nice day hope it does'nt rain"
512124,Billy Bob,2010-10-15 18:31:00,5865,Can you translate that into English....I have always had trouble understanding what you post.
512131,aplumma,2010-10-15 18:58:00,6896,"I purchase a Virginia fishing license,Potomac River charter license,Virginia gill net license,three boat registrations and one documented vessel totaling yearly $155.00 all of these go towards marine upkeep and patrolling of my waterways I use. To go up North and fish the fee is less than $50.oo  for a week which is used to make the fishing/boating experience better.How could you not want to contribute to something that gives back so much to you?"
512305,mercman,2010-10-16 17:04:00,7054,"i agree with you Art.The funds collected go to promoting conservation, better boating, regulation enforcement, fish research etc.Here in Quebec, a fishing a resident fishing licence is $19.25. A real bargain if you ask me."
512317,nofish4me,2010-10-16 17:48:00,404,At first glance I thought this is what you got. http://news.ontario.ca/mto/en/2009/11/new-green-licence-plate-selected-by-ontarians.html
511891,aplumma,2010-10-14 21:39:00,6896,I received a card that is shaped like a credit card in the mail today from The MNR called an outdoor card.It is green in color and has all of the information that I fill out when I get my fishing license when I visit up North. I am not sure what it covers/use is? Does this mean I am finally officially a Canadian? Please answer quickly before I sell my house and higher a moving van to start the move to my new home.   Art
511893,irishfield,2010-10-14 21:41:00,26272,Sorry brother Art... it's just an avenue for our Government to make more money off you with less effort.
511895,smally21,2010-10-14 21:43:00,993,you should move here anyway-play your cards right you can get FREE EVERYTHING
511896,Terry,2010-10-14 21:45:00,14456,it's got a radioisotope in it so they can track you when you come to canada
511898,aplumma,2010-10-14 21:50:00,6896,You mean my Northern dream card is actually another way for me to pay money to a governmental program? No Way y'all have got to be jerkin me around.....   O well I guess I will use it to jimmy open doors down South here till next year when I go back North.   Art
511899,Whopper,2010-10-14 21:51:00,2174,"I have the same card Art  I didn't mind paying for it, it was supposed to make it easier for us to obtain future licenses which it hasn't"
511900,discophish,2010-10-14 21:52:00,392,Insert the card into an ATM machine and wait for the prompt to see what you have won.  If it displays Canada's deficit in the Billions ... RUN!!!  Don't play again because it's a losing battle!
511902,Muskieman,2010-10-14 21:53:00,2472,"lets you pay ""resident "" pricing for hunting and fishing ... that's it... hire the moving van any way.... come on up... there's lotsa room here for ya.   Outdoors Card?... not just a fishing card?... that's a good thing.. also lets you apply for a Tag and hunt as a citizen of Ontario.  Randy "
511903,Billy Bob,2010-10-14 21:57:00,5865," I also have the same card but did mind paying for it as I recognized just another government money grab. Good for 3 years but I didn't take a Canadian fishing trip this year so it's only good for two years at best...maybe one..  On the bright side of this.......ah, have really thought of one yet..."
511906,Billy Bob,2010-10-14 22:00:00,5865," Randy, I don't think that is correct.......I had to purchase a non-resident fishing license that does cost more than the one you purchased. Please correct me if I am wrong.  Bob"
511907,aplumma,2010-10-14 22:03:00,6896,"Randy it is more than likely just the fishin card. It is labeled as an outdoor card but in red it Says Fishing Peche which I assume is Fishing in French. I guess this means I cant hunt any ""citizens of Ontario.""  Why should this card act any different than my other ATM cards?  Phil I am happy to be a member of the Canadian Governments machine for all of the great times and memories I have from up North it is small price to pay.  Art"
511910,aplumma,2010-10-14 22:08:00,6896,here is what the official web site says... is this more or less than the residential fees?

511911,Muskieman,2010-10-14 22:11:00,2472,Yep... that's just the fishing card... nevermind what I said  Randy 
511916,Billy Bob,2010-10-14 22:19:00,5865,"I hate to admit to it....but now I am more confused than before....so do non-residents pay more or the same as a Ontario Resident for a fishing license after you already posses a ""Outdoor Card""  Bob"
511921,Muskieman,2010-10-14 22:28:00,2472,  I think that it's the same... but what picture appears on your cards?  Turkeys or Smallies?   Randy 
511925,Billy Bob,2010-10-14 22:35:00,5865,Mine is actually green with what appears to be MAYBE a largemouth.
511938,Rich Clemens,2010-10-14 23:16:00,3131,"Yup.  Mine is green with what appears to be a bass on it.  Also has Fishing  Pesche.  HA - Now if I could only catch some.  But, it must be worth it.  I spend more time on the water in Ontario than I do here in my own home state.   30+ bucks here for a license and trout stamp - and I have yet to catch a fish here in PA. But, I've only been out one time for a few hours."
511956,Bernie,2010-10-15 00:22:00,3190,"Art, the next card will be for a boaters license  ."
512017,Billy Bob,2010-10-15 10:44:00,5865," There is a real good SECRET spot in PA that have produced a LOT of Bass and Walleyes........I could tell you where but then it wouldn't be a Secret spot........well OK, since you have been a faithful member here I will give you a small hint.....tow your boat north until you come to this small pond called LAKE ERIE....  ......if you can't catch fish in this pond, give up fishing and take up golf..."
512021,fish_fishburn,2010-10-15 10:59:00,1311,"Art, don't forget to use your new card the next time you go to any B.P.S. store and you will get 50% off all your merchandise."
512033,Whopper,2010-10-15 11:56:00,2174,"Art I feel the same way, small price to pay for a privilege to enjoy ourselves.  My comment on the ""easier"" part was I thought #1 we would be able to purchase our licenses online which isn't the case yet. On some of my trips it's been a hassle trying to find a place that is open to purchase one and #2 we wouldn't have to give all our info when we renewed.  Having the ""Green Card"" does not get us a discount on licenses and I always feel like I get my money's worth"
512034,Billy Bob,2010-10-15 12:07:00,5865," I have to disagree about a small price to pay to enjoy ourselves....you see I may be older than most here and can remember when there was no ""Outdoor Card"" (money grab) and the non-resident licenses were about $10 and the residents of Ontario didn't need a fishing license AND the fishing was even better back then before the government got too involved. But hey, that's only me remembering the GOOD 'OLE DAYS...  Bob"
512059,Grimace,2010-10-15 13:46:00,2020,"I like the way New York does it.  I get my non resident online in minutes every year so I can enjoy both sides of the Niagara River.  That being said, if you do not like the Ontario licencing fees Billy Bob you do not have to buy one.  As for it being free before in the good old days I guess things changed in New York State as well because the last I heard you have to pay for them there and everywhere else now too.  It not just us commie pinko northerners.  just having some fun with ya man.  :-)"
512060,Whopper,2010-10-15 13:47:00,2174," Bob I'm no youngster The cost of everything ain't like it used to be. I could complain about traveling the thruway in your state, Cripes PN state line to Utica NY used to be free also,then it was pocket change now one has take a loan out, but I still won't complain because I choose to visit there. My first trip to Ontario 1973 the exchange rate was upside down, I had a hard time understanding why I would have to give an extra ten cents on a dollar, I sucked it up. As far as the good ole days I can also remember many years where the exchange rate was way in our favor (50 to 60%)I believe we are about par now. As far as the fishing or should I say ""catching"" it all depends on where you go in Ontario, places I've been to in the last few years with the exception of Nipissing, it's hard to believe at any time it was too much better"
512066,Beans,2010-10-15 14:03:00,3339," Hey Art...  When you apply for your yearly license and the guy sez to not forget to ""stick it"" the card gives you a place to put the sticker...  Sounds like the next step will be to issue a three year license along with the three year plastic card for non-residents...  Cheers Mate   "
