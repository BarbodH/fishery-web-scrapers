512159,solopaddler,2010-10-15 20:28:00,8605,"  Yeah well you'd have to tip everyone in then 'cause pretty much everyone blatantly snags there LOL!  I'm going to tell you guys a story about the NY DEC.  I was there last year and witnessed this first hand.  First off as mentioned snaggers are EVERYWHERE.  Someone I know caught 2 female salmon completely legit, stripped them and released them unharmed.  Someone in the gauntlet of rubes called the DEC and they came specifically to intercept this person.  He was apprehended in the parking lot and asked to produce a license which he did.  The officers chided him for not keeping and killing the 2 hen salmon. Apparantly unlike in ON stripping fish is illegal. (In ON the eggs from said fish go towards your daily limit).  The guy goes on to say he understands no one really wants to eat them (they're black and rotting). Said next time kill the fish and leave the eggs in it. When you get to your vehicle remove the eggs THEN IF YOU DON'T WANT THE FISH THROW IT IN ONE OF THE TRASH CANS.  He got a ticket for illegal disposal of game fish. What he suggested is the LITERAL definition of illegal disposal of game fish where I'm from LOL!  If the fish are stripped and released they at least have a CHANCE at survival. A heck of a lot better chance than dead in the garbage LOL!  This person asks the DEC officer what about all the people blatantly snagging? Why pick on him? No real answer to that unfortunately.  It's just a HORRIBLE place to fish especially when the DEC literally condones what's happening.   (BTW this person isn't me, but it is a board member who shall remain anonymous.  )"
512160,Terry,2010-10-15 20:33:00,14456,ok I don't know where or what country that was snagged in..is snagging illegal there  I don't understand the pop-can tab...does that mean he meant to snag it or was it an accidental snag....I really don't know the answers to these questions  EDIT:  LOL I see my questions were answered as I was typing this
512166,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-15 21:22:00,0,  And here I thought that our MNR were hard to deal with. Having to defend yourself against a bogus charge is beyond me. Guess it's the same hard headed Bull we all have to deal with on both sides of the boarder when it comes to authority over stepping their bounds.  I wonder who that OFC member was.....
512215,markiemark70,2010-10-16 01:04:00,158,"OK I feel like a complete moron asking this question, but what the hell:  Why do people take the eggs from salmon? Is it just to use for bait? That just seems so ironic to me that people catch a fish to get bait to catch a fish. Or are they eating them? I know that alot of eggs come out of a fish, so how long would that last as bait? Can you freeze it for next year?  Sorry but i dont get it."
512224,vinnimon,2010-10-16 01:22:00,2593,"  Actually, I spoke to friend recently! His neighbour cooks the fish and with the eggs, makes caviar for the family!Mind you I have seen or tried it!"
512230,fish-miester,2010-10-16 02:14:00,864,wow.. and that is why i dont fish the rivers.. i would defenetly not get along if i fished there..
511991,fishinguypat,2010-10-15 02:55:00,547,
511993,xkempx,2010-10-15 03:12:00,84,On a pop tap  ....And a size 2 hook... not fun to see......I DONT GET IT  ....2000 fish and a 1000sqft area...
511996,Beats,2010-10-15 03:19:00,543,"  Yeah, the fish's back was hungry for that.  I don't get how ppl consider that fishing or how someone could possibly promote that on the internet."
511997,GBW,2010-10-15 03:23:00,8460,"ok, let me get a beer and a snack to watch this one then..."
511998,markiemark70,2010-10-15 03:24:00,158,"That's ridiculous. I wonder what the guys on the other side were thinking, or do you think they are snaggers too?"
512003,newboykool,2010-10-15 03:56:00,81,"this isn't even that bad~ i saw someone at the credit some days ago snagging those salmon like crazy~ i took a video of it too~ the dude just kept making the snagging motion for the whole time, maybe i'll post the video up sometime"
512004,MJL,2010-10-15 04:00:00,2427,It's the dirty Burt...What's not normal about that vid?
512007,fishinguypat,2010-10-15 04:06:00,547,These guys are true fisherman : http://www.youtube.com/user/ROADSNAKE90ROADSNAKE
512009,ctranter,2010-10-15 04:10:00,543,"Saw a CO today on the creek at a popular eastern Lake O trib.  He scared the crap out of me because he was sneaking in the forest taking pictures of some snaggers before he confronted them.  The problem is, he (to the best of my knowledge) only ticketed 1 person then left.  There were 10+ people snagging with treble hooks just downstream.  Why show up to a creek without charging more people?"
512011,chris.brock,2010-10-15 08:12:00,4053,"beer tab, cigarette butt, bare hook, they all work fine, the guy is pretty proud of himself, at least he snags fish with 50 lbs test so the fight doesn't last for half an hour, I guess he's a good sportsman"
512022,danbouck,2010-10-15 11:10:00,4380,
512023,fish_fishburn,2010-10-15 11:11:00,1311,What a dick. He is so proud of himself. I would seriously think of tipping a guy like him if I was there.
512043,Rod Caster,2010-10-15 12:44:00,5784,I bet he harmed little animals as a child.
512046,Headhunter,2010-10-15 12:55:00,5703,"Come on guys, it wasn't a salmon he snagged, it was a porpoise! It simply in haled the beer tab through it's blow hole! Heck, most of the OFNER's I've met would dive in the water for a beer tab, in hopes of finding the beer! On the up side, no marshmellows were harmed in the making of that video. (Hee hee... I said blow hole!) HH"
512050,tb4me,2010-10-15 13:05:00,3295,Im not a slamon fisher but that doesnt even come close to the Idea of sport fishing in my mind.. See all those guys out there...wow It almost looked like they could have just used the net to grab them. There is no way id be interested in fishing with that many ppl in one spot. I dont get what the pop can tab has to do with how he was fishing. Its not like the fish took the bait willingly...
512052,jbailey,2010-10-15 13:11:00,866,so weak. the credit is so brutal as well especially near streetsville dam
512062,Twocoda,2010-10-15 13:56:00,4130,this is proof that morons do grow up...what a clown ...i wonder if he will video tape himself when he commits his next illegal act...
512063,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-15 13:56:00,0,reminds me of Olcott.....  as well as places around here.
512065,MJL,2010-10-15 14:01:00,2427, Wouldn't be the first time someone has incriminated themselves with Youtube:  http://troutunderground.com/2007/08/15/pair-poach-steelhead-boast-about-it-on-youtube/
512068,Stoty,2010-10-15 14:26:00,2910, LOL

512116,seaman,2010-10-15 18:03:00,11,  You think????? LOL
512125,PikeMolester,2010-10-15 18:40:00,428,thats just a massacre
512137,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-15 19:22:00,3761,Just awful...surprised a thread with reference in fish poaching hasn't been closed yet....
512152,PikeMolester,2010-10-15 20:09:00,428,why would they close it? This ain't communist Russia! Its not like this thread is in support of snagging
