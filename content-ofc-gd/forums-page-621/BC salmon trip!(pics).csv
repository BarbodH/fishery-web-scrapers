511878,sleded,2010-10-14 21:00:00,96,Well i had the chance to fish the rivers of BC for the big salmon run and let me tell you it was worth going out for!! Every morning just got better and better!! Lots of fresh fish coming from the ocean every day. The only thing i thought was dumb was you have to buy a tag for the springs if you want to keep one a day. We got lots of hatchery cohos and a lot of wild ones which you cannot keep. The springs were kind of pests and wouldint let anything go by!! Had a great time and would for sure do it again!!                  
511887,BrownTown,2010-10-14 21:34:00,103,Buying a tag for fish is probably the best thing going. Too bad they don't implement it in Ontario...  Nice trip!
511934,cwpowell,2010-10-14 22:56:00,265,why do their heads look detatched?
511936,Beats,2010-10-14 23:06:00,543,  They've been bled out.

512019,fish_fishburn,2010-10-15 10:50:00,1311,That is awesome. I had planned to go out to Chilliwack this fall but just starting a new job put it on the back burner till next year. When is the best time of the year to go? I will be staying at a friends place in Chilliwack but he doesn't fish. He says he going to start since he lives so close to the Vedder and Fraser river's.
