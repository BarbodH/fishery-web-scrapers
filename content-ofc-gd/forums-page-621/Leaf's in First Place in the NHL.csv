There are still a few changes they could make, but I'll take it at this point. Some of the top teams from last year, just don't have their legs yet, so things will definitely get tougher once they round into form."

They should have stuck with Guigere till he lost and then put the monster in nice and fresh. Bad move Wilson!

Perhaps many of you cheered for (gasp) the Leafs? LOL!  Whoever, it doesn't really matter.  How does someone grow up watching and cheering for a particular team suddenly switch allegiance?  I live in Hamilton and if they ever did get that franchise I'd still cheer for the Leafs.  It always seems to be Sen's fans who chirp the most when it comes to the Leafs. Although I do understand why...you're never going to get over those playoff beatings LOL!  As a Leaf fan it's gratifying to finally see an actual plan in place that seems to be working. (so far  )"

Lot of big name Blackhawks especially played junior in St. Kitts long ago. Remember Pierre Pilote had a string of laundromats in town back then.   NHL didn't pay too well then I guess."

512056,tb4me,2010-10-15 13:31:00,3295,"This right here is a quote from maple leafs.com. This is one of the reasons were so strong this year  •  Korbinian Holzer was called up from the Marlies in time to practise, then fly to Ottawa. There was no locker assigned at practice, so Holzer sat on a chair in the middle of the dressing room, players and media walking around him. “That’s okay, I’d sit on the ground to play for the Toronto Maple Leafs,” said the defenceman, a fourth-round draft pick in 2006."
511296,ctranter,2010-10-12 17:44:00,543," ""Injuries"" are sport wide... I was talking specifically to injuries to the leaf top line (practically their only source of scoring), and to their goalie, who has stood on his head.  If Datsyuk goes down Detroit won't be hit as hard as a collective unit than if Versteeg does."

I've been working a lot this week, and been out of the loop, but looking at the shots to goals ratio, did the Pens trade for Carey Price??"

IMO, he is one of the most arrogant players ever, and doesn't really have a reason to be that way. When I saw him chirping Crosby, I had to laugh. I'm sorry, but until you have done what Crosby has for the game, and accomplished even a few of the things he has..you need to keep your trap shut!  I don't know him on a personal level like you do, and he just might be the nicest guy around, but to me, as a former high level hockey player, he comes off extremely cocky."

I think he could have done better on the 3rd goal but over all, 2 thumbs up! Everyone is yapping about the Orr fight, but anyone can land a lucky punch. We will see in round two!!!Comes to show how important Orr is to this team. After he left and the bodies stopped flying, they Penguins picked up their game. Brown played an excellent game and should have been on the ice for that last minute.  I really like our team, they are fast, they are winning face-offs(very important), they played well defensively(except the 3rd period) they are playing with heart and look hungry out there(cant wait for the playoffs)!!I really liked our penalty killing with only one mistake that led to the first goal. He came in too deep and gave the point shooter too much time. The only thing is our defensmen should play the body more on those 2 on 2s. I can understand 2 on 1 or 3 on 2 but you cant just let them walk into our end like that!  Looking forward to the next game!!!!"
511803,ctranter,2010-10-14 15:45:00,543,"  Haha, I think you are bang on.  He was drafted in the 2nd round, and while he was still playing for Belleville he was quoted in an interview as saying something very close to ""I am going to bring a stanley cup to Montreal""... pure arrogance.  I think that cockiness is part of his whole persona as a player.  With all of the well spoken, classy rook's that have been coming up through the draft system in the past few years, it's certainly shocking to see PK mouthing off and other on ice tomfoolery.  That being said, you gotta give the guy credit.  He came up to replace Markov last post season, nailed his on-ice tryout with the big club, and he earned himself a core D spot for this season.  He isn't doing rediculoulus spin-o-ramma's anymore either.  Funny story about PK.  I used to work in the pro shop at Canlan Ice Sports on Martin Grove.  If I was working a Fri night shift, that was GTHL night, so on my breaks I would always go watch the AAA Marlies teams that would be playing.  I vividly remember one game where PK was playing (I think he was minor midget back then).  He started with the puck at his goal line.  He skated full stream with the PK ignoring all of his teammates, tried a spinoramma at the opposing blue line, lost it, and gave up a 3-on-1 that lead to a goal.  Google PK Subban and you will find scouting reports that talk about exactly this kind of scenario, haha.  Anyhoo, all this talk about a Habs player is a real buzzkill. Keep it up leafs"
511804,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-14 15:47:00,0,kadri is the undisputed champ of being too cocky.  where's he these days?
511806,Harrison,2010-10-14 15:49:00,2202,I will admit the last few games have been refreshing to watch.  Brown reminds me of a 16 yr old getting his first shot in the OHL.
511827,muskymatt,2010-10-14 17:25:00,2608," Optimistically I can look at it and say with one win...Ottawa leaps to 7th or 8th place....will that happen? Who knows, maybe....one thing I would be willing to bet money on is at the end of the season the Laffs will NOT be in first place and Ottawa will not be in last.  As soon as the Laffs wake up and remember that they are the Laffs, they will start to play like the Laffs and will miss the playoffs again as usual or as always...your pick.  For any Leaf fans who don't know what the playoffs are....it's what happens after regular season for good teams...  The Sens will be fine...better than fine most likely and will see playoff action once again.  Go Sens Go!"

They are fore checking, getting good scoring, getting good goal tending, getting production from all lines, finishing their checks. Its been good so far. The only concern on the table right now is some sloppy play by the defense, but the defense will gel and hopefully this will be cleaned up.  Never mind the wins.

510804,Rod Caster,2010-10-10 14:58:00,5784,hahaha brutal. All the leafs fans are going off soft because they are on a two games winning streak. Welcome to the world of average hockey teams you'll like it here.
510805,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-10 15:01:00,0,is this thread for real? 
510812,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-10 15:17:00,0,"Come on! Thats like winning the first hand in a poker tournament and claiming your chip leader.lol. A little premature. Now if the Habs had won 2 games in a row, they would already be planning their Stanley cup parade.LOL"
510820,muskymike,2010-10-10 15:38:00,772,Can someone tell me where Ottawa is on this list?  Maybe MuskyMatt can chime in?
510822,fishinguypat,2010-10-10 15:46:00,547,When they win 5 or more in a row I may glance at the topic but for now... 80 more games to go
511010,Rizzo,2010-10-11 12:34:00,4754,I'm not getting too excited about the start but its better than losing the first 2. Lets face it they beat 2 borderline playoff teams.

511032,jjcanoe,2010-10-11 14:54:00,744,"funny thing is that, during the preseason there were habs fans and sens fans that seemed very vocal around here especially after the Leafs 1st preseason game...... just wondering where they are now, when the games actually count........  jjcanoe"
511039,Garry2Rs,2010-10-11 15:15:00,1425,"The names on the sweaters change but the show remains the same... By Xmas the Leafs drop to last place in their division. The media will howl for changes and management will respond by trading their draft picks or some youngster, that shows promise, for a couple of old retreads. By the second season, in April, Toronto will be fighting for the last play-off spot.  It's a toss-up if they will make it, but either way they will be golfing before the end of May.

511044,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-11 15:53:00,0," still here. talk to me in march, ""when it counts""..."
511053,F7Firecat,2010-10-11 16:16:00,347,"2 game winning streak , hahahahahahaha   plan the parade boys right up bay street in the heart of the finacial backers LOL"
511062,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-11 17:29:00,0,"For the record and in the defense of the Leafs cupless streak?? If anyone recalls? We got robbed out of Stanley cup finals, that I believe we would have won, in regards to a crappy penalty drawn by Wayne Gretzgy! Any one remember that one?"
511063,uglyfish,2010-10-11 17:32:00,981,  vividly....
511141,Garry2Rs,2010-10-12 00:52:00,1425,Winners fans have parades.  Leaf fans have excuses!
511217,Jer,2010-10-12 11:46:00,1426,"   ...by my math, these games count every bit as much as the ones in March..."
511226,Carp,2010-10-12 12:33:00,1488," Yes, I remember that game very well Johnny. They should have been in the final that year and I also think they would have won the cup. Anyone else would have received a penalty for the high stick, but Gretzky got away with it because he's ""The Great One"" and can do no wrong. Apparently Doug Gilmour's chin just started bleeding on it's own (requiring stitches) after Gretzky's stick came up around his face. Hmmm !!! When you see the replay, it's clear Gretzky should have been gone.  The Leafs may not win the cup this year, but at least the team is looking like they want to win, and so far, have been fun to watch."
511246,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-12 13:55:00,0,  I'm talking about what place the teams are in goober. 
511252,Garry2Rs,2010-10-12 14:39:00,1425,"Everyone knows the old Ontario saying: ""Spring is here and the Leaf's are falling.""  By the way, Ottawa and Buffalo both lost last night... Is it too soon to start planning the parade?"
511255,ctranter,2010-10-12 14:53:00,543,"It's hilarious how defensive these habs fans get when any discussion starts about leaf success.  We had a brutal last season, the worst I've seen in my 23 years.  This year however, (so far) they are playing dynamite hockey.  Are we not allowed to celebrate in our teams apparent improvement?  Nobody is talking cup (at least nobody that actually has played hockey and understands the game), we are talking progress.  Sounds like you guys are shackin in your booties over there in MTL.  As for the ""see you in march"" comment, many teams slump after the new year when playoff crunch time begins. All it takes is one injury to giggy, or to any of either Bozak, Kessel, or Versteeg to slow the leafs down, but until then if you are proud to wear blue and white, wear it proud.  Thus far I have really enjoyed watching Schenner play with more confidence, Kaberle finally realized that his stick is capable of doing something other than passing, and Komi is destroying bodies in the corners.  Kessel isn't doing the same cookie-cutter play off the top of the left circle, curling towards the net and letting go a snap shot, and Versteeg is showing why he was one of the largest contributors to the Chi town cup run.  The kids got heart.  That being said I think I will actually pay attention to the marlees this season, based on their potential for major development in a few key players.  The leafs big club are already looking like one of the fastest teams in the league (see how they made the sens look like a bunch of geriatrics? lol).  Just wait until Kadri , Caputi, and D'Amigo start playing the PP together.  As for the habs, I respect the crap out of PK Subban.  I played with this kid at Runnymede Collegiate and I know how much of a riot he can be in the dressing room.  Not only that, he has made 200% improvement from a season ago.  That 76 would look great in blue and white.  /hockey rant"
511260,tb4me,2010-10-12 15:09:00,3295,"Go Leafs go! I am equally as excited for this years team. As for the habs fans they are what they are...Habs fans.  All i can say is thank-god for them! Otherwise we wouldnt have anybody to Verbally accost. But seriously, we face the pens tommorow night. This should be interesting to say the least. The pens actually have a skilled team and will be the real deal as far as a test goes..."
511279,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-12 16:51:00,0, Yup. That's been a problem with the leafs. Injuries. Go see how many leaf players played a full season last year. Not too many.
511286,SBCregal,2010-10-12 17:10:00,688,"injuries is a problem league wide, its hardly a toronto thing"
511291,jbailey,2010-10-12 17:25:00,866,GO ROCK GO! not a big fan base but a real one!
