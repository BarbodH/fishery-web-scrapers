Saw this one in CT flyer, any input if it can be used on ice?  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/1/Hunting/StandsBlinds/PRD~0750702P/Ameristep%252BHub%252BHunting%252BBlind%25252C%252BTangle%252B2.0.jsp?locale=en"

The entrance is smaller than an ice hut entrance.  2.  Lotsa windows, but whe you open them, they are just screened, could get pretty breezy on the ice.  hat being said, the screens do velcro out.  You could replace them with home-made windows.  3.  No snow skirt.  Once again, could get pretty breezy.  Other than that, not bad....."

I bought an ice fishing tent a while ago and both Malcolm and I had a four person tent and those poles don't like the cold. Both of ours cracked first or second trip out  I have a 2 man Clam and a single Frabill now. Buy an ice hut not a tent."
