I went 8 for 10 and 5 of those were cookie cutter short fat 2 pounders (which to me is quite odd as this time of year usually produces 4s and 5s more frequently than 2s). Lost on big fish about 10 ft from the boat and my biggest landed fish was 4.2 pounds. Fish are kind of all over the place right now and I caught fish in water from 12ft to 45ft.  Fun day, just didn't get the weights I was looking for. Fish are getting fat but they are not yet the football they can be.  The next two weeks should be pretty good.   "
