512005,Minnow,2010-10-15 04:04:00,177,Hey guys wanted to know if the boxing day sale at Lebaron which is usually no tax and the 10% Lebaron discount applies to Firearms. I wanted to get a Sako Rifle but dont have the cash to get during the hunting sale right now and wanted to save up for the Boxing day sale.  Thanks!
512010,toca,2010-10-15 04:40:00,274,i dont think so.... maybe?  I remember buying a whole bunch of fishing and camping stuff but cant rember if it was only those that was assigned with a colored price tag.  i do however remember the stuff priced as special dont get the 10 percent discount.
