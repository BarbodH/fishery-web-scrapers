Hanging out while I get ready for the successful release, she just swam off calmly....    All in all, a successful day, searching out and finding a couple of reefs that I have wanted to try out."
512080,jbailey,2010-10-15 15:35:00,866,oh wow thats a nice one - how long?
512084,bigbuck,2010-10-15 15:50:00,2449,"I figure about 38-40"" or so. I didn't have a tape measure with me. Besides, I was fishing by myself so I didn't want to keep the fish out of water for too long."

512132,Rich Clemens,2010-10-15 19:09:00,3131,Nice Fish.  I troll with the Believer quite a bit and have never even had a hit on one yet. I know other who use them - with success. Congrats.
512139,Joey,2010-10-15 19:27:00,9122,Beauty Ski.  Is that snow?
512150,bigbuck,2010-10-15 20:01:00,2449,"Joey, it's not snow, it's rain that must have reflected the flash, it was getting pretty dark when I caught the fish."
512471,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-17 11:56:00,0,"Nice healthy GB Ski. That's the best time to catch a Musky! Before the storm, during or in between breaks! Thanks for sharing."
512493,ehg,2010-10-17 14:30:00,2666,Looks like a successful excursion. Picked your spot and sure enough there was a decent muskie waiting for you. Very nice
