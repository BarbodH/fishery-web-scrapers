511626,ehg,2010-10-13 22:33:00,2666,"I remember back in the mid-80's, as a young teen, reading an article in Chronzy's Ontario Fisherman on the egg sinker/big roe bag setup(with little styro balls in it). You would cast as far out in lake as possible by a rivermouth and wait for a fish to hit. Sometimes the Mitchell 300 and 6lb Stren would get spooled. Not sure there is as many fish or access to trib mouths like back then. You need stillwater for stillfishing."
511654,BillM,2010-10-13 23:55:00,17367," Ah yes, the pencil weight.  I was out with Solo last year on the Niagara and there is a definite 'feel' that needs to be acquired to get the hang of it."

511205,Kwan,2010-10-12 05:46:00,132,"So that means i put a sinker a few feet away from a hook and stop the sinker with a swivel, then put a sponge on my hook, and i'm practically guaranteed to snag them?  whereas if i use a #2 spinner, or put a worm instead of a sponge, i won't snag them?  I don't get it.  Is 8 lb braid with 8 lb leader on a 6'6 medium enough to handle a salmon?"

511212,Spiel,2010-10-12 09:59:00,9065,   Yep.  I've done a lot of beach/shore fishing for steel over the years and the egg sinker floating bag set up is NOT a flossing technique in this situation.  
511248,craigdritchie,2010-10-12 14:21:00,1586,"Uh huh. Best way to catch steelhead some days, especially when there's no water in the ditches and all the one-method Steelhead Masters are whining about a lack of rain.  Also works well in bigger rivers. Every day people catch rainbows in the lower Niagara by bottom bouncing with floating bags. Those fish aren't flossed either."

511282,Kilka,2010-10-12 17:00:00,17,"Bill,  While you did give good advice with regards to float fishing, the flossing comment was really unnecessary.  It's not like the guy suggested putting a hook on the line and then a sinker 2 feet down the line (an actual flossing rig).  With the egg sinker first and then a leader/hook, even if the steelhead get the line caught in their mouth they are likely to bump off it once they get down to the egg sinker. This is especially true if you use a longer leader, like you should."
511292,perchslayer666,2010-10-12 17:33:00,280,"Go down to Angus, everybody fishes on bottom due to the non-existant current up there. I went there with my pin gear and a friendly local told me the right way to fish this area. Sometime bottom bouncinh is the only way to go. BillM your steelhead elietist mentality is a major fail. Stick to flossing your teeth."
511295,Dutchy,2010-10-12 17:44:00,416,"I seem to remember another steelhead thread that went this way pinners Vs the ""other"" methods for catching steelhead.  Bottom bouncing if done correctly is a very effective way of catching steelhead and is most definitely not flossing. I have seen people do this on the Saugeen, Maitland, Bayfield, nine-mile to name but a few rivers. I personally have found that still fishing for steelhead is a good way of doing it, but often results on you sitting on your hands for a while as you cannot possibly cover the same amount of water that you would with a float."

I am not saying bottom rigging or bottom bouncing is not effective, it's just kinda boring, if you place your rod in a makeshift rod holder and wait for a fish to come to your bait. Rather than bringing the bait to the fish and covering more water.  The only situation where bottom bouncing is really more effective than float fishing is in extremely deep and fast current, where the weight of the bottom bouncing rig slows down the whole presentation for the fish, thereby giving the fish a chance to look at the bait and strike.   For the love of God, lock this thread, ha ha, lol"

Get organized, cast out and have a good chat with whoever your fishing buddies are for the day.

I personally get annoyed when steelheading gets broken down into us vs them groups. Some guys like to use a float and centrepin, some guys like to fly fish, others throw lures, or bottom bounce and still fish. I think the one thing everyone can agree on all these tactics can catch fish and all have been abused by certain ""anglers"" and used a guise to snag."

511101,GoneFishin,2010-10-11 22:12:00,349,Lol I love how your always concerned about people flossing...  I think you should stop spamming peoples threads. If someone is looking for help then maybe they are past snaging or they would just be using treble hooks or heavy lures I'm sure. Trout deffinitaly feed in the rivers and fishing in slow water on the clear side can call for no floats because trout can easily spook from seeing your float on the top of the water. I've never used eggs weights and bottom bounced in the river but I have fished trout with light setups with awesome results. Couple of double AA split shot about 4 feet up from your roe bag. Other then clear shallow conditions I would just stick to a float set up though.
511105,BillM,2010-10-11 22:35:00,17367, lol I love how you missed the entire first page and my second reply as to why a float setup would be a good idea.  Eyes open next time kid.

511125,bongo,2010-10-12 00:08:00,67,"To be honest the MNR should just close fishing on small rivers and creeks between late August till October 1st so the Salmon can do their thing. The fishing for these Salmon is not very legit, when they reach shallow waters all they wanna do is spawn not feed, Ontario is not B.C. where they have deep wide rivers where chrome salmon will gladly take your bait.  Open the rivers in October, so people can fish for trout and that way less snagging. And to be honest, you don't really need salmon roe that much, why kill a salmon for roe if you can use a variety of different flies and baits to take trout on. I know because I love using artificial baits and flies and they are very effective."
511130,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-12 00:21:00,0,the snaggers are already breaking the law with little enforcement.  why would that change with closed fishing?
511135,Twocoda,2010-10-12 00:37:00,4130,  rattlin raps ..cleos ...mepps...5 of diamonds will all catch bows chucking hardware out into the lake ..i prefer the rattlin raps myself since normally there is sediment in the outflow and if the fish cant see the lures.....they will hear it ..but they all work fine ..  edit to add canadian wigglers
511136,Twocoda,2010-10-12 00:42:00,4130, respectfully disagree bongo ...to improve on this the MNR should designate depths of a river as santuary ...5 feet or less is closed to all anglers ...i think it would eliminate alot of the problems ...and people can continue to fish in the greater depths...
511148,danjang,2010-10-12 01:05:00,148," I respectfully disagree Twocoda. This would eliminate all the eastern tribs effectively killing the sport fishery there. Hell, there's only a handful of areas in the credit that's over 5 feet in depth. Also, people who would even abide by this would have to carry around a pole at least 5 feet long to check to see if they can fish it.  Salmon also do bite in rivers. I'm new to fishing so I can't really explain why but some days it is just ON to a point where almost every single drift was taken."
511150,danjang,2010-10-12 01:22:00,148," It's not the 1 foot off the bottom that flosses exactly, it's the line leading to the sinker that can make it seem like you have a fish when they bump into it. The natural reaction is to set the hook which in turn snags the fish. Just keep the rod tip high to minimize this."
511180,bongo,2010-10-12 02:38:00,67,"Twocoda, you got a point, but come on it wouldn't hurt too much if they close the shallow creeks and rivers for a month and half and yes of course (Dr. Salvelinus) some people will still break the law and fish a sanctuary and snag, but this will definitely be a benefit for both Salmon and Trout numbers, by keeping away most anglers for this time period. Again Salmon roe isn't the only bait out there that will catch you trout, so why kill a fish for it if you are not going to eat it. (And I love those idiots who slice a salmon's belly to check if it's a female, turns out it's a male oh well I just killed a fish who cares I'll just toss it aside)"
511192,timmeh,2010-10-12 03:25:00,609,I completely disagree with closing the creeks. Closing the tribs would prevent a significant portion of the public the opportunity to fish for salmon. It's a public resource and not everyone can afford a boat and all the equipment to fish the big lakes. Besides while some natural reproduction takes place the salmon fishery is essentially dependent on stocking to sustain it.
511196,steelie hunter,2010-10-12 03:57:00,55," I agree completely, but cant help but laugh the odd time I see a 25 lb hen salmon caught and kept to eat, but the guts and ROE tossed aside... never thought Id see that happen."
511198,Twocoda,2010-10-12 04:08:00,4130," i dont think it would eliminate all the tribs granted alot of the sections though ...there are many spots on the wilmot harmony credit and bronte that have pools 5 feet deep or greater...what it might do for the ones that dont want walk to find them is ...move the fishermen closer to the lake so the fish that do make it through the gauntlet of hooks will actually stand a chance at going about their business...and thats not a bad thing ..plus the fish that are caught ...chances are they will still be of chrome colour and edible if one was to desire eating it and the fight of the fish would be more fierce then a dark old boot ...yes there will still be boots caught in these depths ...but more then likely they will be finished their business ...i know its alot of ""what ifs"" and ""more then likelys "" but it would keep the fish open for the reason they are in the water ...to catch as Timmeh stated in his post...its all about the sport and the great outdoors..the fish are just a bonus...  the craft of presentation goes along way regardless of the depth even the flossers and rippers will have to hone their skills at 5 feet or greater...  Just my two cents..."
510691,fishinguypat,2010-10-09 23:37:00,547,What are good rigs for still fishing for steelhead with roe? I'm planning on going some where where I'll be doing this. Any help would be appreciated

510729,BillM,2010-10-10 02:03:00,17367," Honestly, run your bag below a float.. Here are a few reasons.  1. You won't be flossing (aka snagging fish) 2. It's adjustable, you can fish the upper water column for those active fish or the bottom for the not so active ones. 3. You can pop, jig and do pretty much impose any action you want on your bait. 4. You can switch it up easily, live worms, jigs with maggots, live minnows, etc etc."
510737,DMASSE,2010-10-10 02:26:00,420,"   Good if your fishing under 15-20 ft....  But he said he is still-fishing for steelhead,    So fishing with a floating roebag, swivel and a slip sinker would be fine,   Its no different from fishing at the dams for walleyes or baiting a rig for carp.   If the steelhead are there and see the roe they will hit it...  Hate to tell ya Bill you can still snag fish with a float, as a accident  or on purpose.  Its up to the fisherman if they want to fish right or wrong....  Thats my 2cents"
510739,danjang,2010-10-10 02:37:00,148," He asked for it. I do not do this myself anymore because you do in fact floss and snag. However, they do bite using this rig casting out into the lake. Steelheading isn't always river fishing you know ."
510759,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-10 03:44:00,1107,The only way to catch steelhead legitimitly is with a float LOL. Seriously there are plenty of ways to catch them and I use almost the same rig mentioned beach fishing and have caught all kinds of bows and browns this way I have also caught a tonne of steelhead on a simple split shot and roe bag set up no float just drifted in the main current. I have been float fishing with the pin for the last 5-6 years and don't use the other techniques anymore because the pin is way more fun but I might bust out the 10 footer and head to the beach soon its always fun to hook a good one in the big water from shore. Float fishing isn't the only way to catch a steelhead
510760,bongo,2010-10-10 03:53:00,67,"I'm a float fisherman mainly, but it's true, You go to the Humber or Credit, most of the float fisherman are just too lazy and either floss or snag the salmon in the pools or in the riffles. It's retarded, if you are gonna do that, just stay home, you don't need a fancy setup to accomplish that and definitely not legitimate. Totally turns me off from fishing there in the early fall   But for still fishing, both setups mentioned are good"
510765,timmeh,2010-10-10 04:16:00,609,If you're set on roe then you've been given a few options. But you can always cast some hardware out at them too. Another option to consider.
510779,sauce,2010-10-10 12:19:00,219,"Don't forget to bring a dozen night crawlers. You can fish them with the same slipsinker rig. Its always a good idea to have a backup plan in case the fish aren't interested in your roe. Might want to use a bit bigger hook than what you'd use for roe. Another thing, don't get caught up in the whole floating roe bag trick. In a lake, there's not a lot of current. So naturally roe would sink to the bottom. The fish smell the roe and find it. Then they suck it in and at this point you should probably set the hook. Floaters are ok, but not a natural presentation. If they're picky, you might get more bites fishing right on bottom."
510823,fishinguypat,2010-10-10 15:53:00,547,"well I'm going with my dad and a friend who is a very good steelhead angler who has spent a lot of money on his float rods, and says he can catch trout easily so ... I think I'll set up a float rig on my rod and my buddies will use the bottom rig... what are some good lures to use when casting out into the lake with sandy bottom?jigs?"
510831,I'mHooked,2010-10-10 16:45:00,525,I've caught a couple of nice 3-4 lb Browns on silver #3 Mepps with egg pattern body. I would imagine the Steelies would take it as well.
510859,buckster,2010-10-10 18:42:00,530,  Well said Dmasse!  im glad someone said it!  I'm not a still fisherman by any means but why would people even bring up the topic of flossing or snagging...  Are u trying to say that a bow wont hit a roe bag suspended off bottom?
510869,ctranter,2010-10-10 19:15:00,543, Dave knows his stuff.  The fact that some meat heads use certain rigs to produce snagging situations doesn't necessarily mean that the rig itself has no legitimate benefits. I don't fish stillwaters often but I can certainly see how this would be ideal for steelehead
510890,ch312,2010-10-10 21:55:00,1590, because some people are kinda slow learners and dont know when to give it up  or they are just trolls looking to stir things up?
510926,fishinguypat,2010-10-10 23:57:00,547,so bows won't hit roe floating off the bottom? or will they?
510940,12footspringbok,2010-10-11 00:53:00,459, Ya what Bill says. I managed to floss 3 bows yesterday with this rig so good the hooks were in the gullet...  With a non floating roebag to boot.
510958,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-11 02:16:00,0,"I watched a pinner and spinning outfit float ""fisherman"" lining salmon with their float gear Friday. ...  Today I had another pinner lay the most EPIC lowhole on me while I was fishing.  Could have nearly touched him with my rod.  I wish the bush leaguers would find a new hobby!"
