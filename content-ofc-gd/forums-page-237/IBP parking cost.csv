853900,irishfield,2014-05-15 22:54:00,26272,Penetang is $19 for locals.. $23 for out of town (Full season $113 and $153). Still working on #1 son (councillor / chair of finance committee) to turn back the hands of time and make it free for everyone.. especially considering I paid for that fancy cement ramp with one years property tax on the plant's property.
853965,BillM,2014-05-16 12:05:00,17367,"Would you appreciate paying $25 for the privilege of parking your car to fish the Niagara?  Most public ramps, like those on the Niagara,  down my way are free. Private ramps are private. I do know that the local clubs are happy to participate and fund stocking in our area.  I know that NOTL instituted a permit system for resident only angling on public lands, and I am one of many who have since boycotted that town. Won't be caught spending a dime in the new basspro either, as I would then be supporting an NOTL business.  If I wanna fish the northern shore of Lake O I pay to park/launch, what's the difference?"
853967,BillM,2014-05-16 12:08:00,17367,"Bill, name a ramp that charges $25 to launch on Lake O.  I know you love to play devils advocate, but let me know about that one.  I know Simcoe is one of the heaviest stocked lakes...from lakers to muskie....  How is it that we all pay to stock, but locals can launch for free....ridiculous if you ask me.  So people are getting in an uproar over $25, but wouldn't over $15?   Come on man.   What do you think it costs me to launch/park at Whiby, Humber, Credit?  Residents of Barrie launch for free in Barrie, I still gotta pay if I wanna launch out of Innisfil or any of the launches on the north shore of Kemp.   I hate paying for launching as well, don't get me wrong but the complaining about this is over the top."
853970,steelhedrmatt,2014-05-16 12:42:00,278,^^^BINGO^^^
853974,Dara,2014-05-16 13:17:00,3052,Why do my tax dollars have to go to stock all the lakes in sounthern On when I never fish them...I'm getting ripped off...I think they should put all your launch and parking fees up to $100.00..that way you pay for what the fish actually cost.
853980,Dara,2014-05-16 14:16:00,3052,Where do they hide that stirring the pot emote anyway
853990,glen,2014-05-16 15:21:00,2641,Please sir can i have some more. Fishing used to be cheap to do.  Paying to launch on simcoe sucks.  Many times the weather gets bad and you only get a couple hours in. $25 on top of gas so your looking at $75 min to go out.
853997,DRIFTER_016,2014-05-16 16:10:00,10439, Where do they hide that stirring the pot emote anyway   
854006,jimmer,2014-05-16 17:58:00,2730,"It is expensive, but there is still access to the lake. I would be pissed if they closed all the launch ramps to the lake. Make a choice and live by it. I choose to find another access point."
854007,misfish,2014-05-16 18:02:00,29133,Launching a float tube is free..
854014,alphaalpha,2014-05-16 20:29:00,475,"I don't think anyone would be angry if it was a reasonable cost to EVERYONE.  I should think Then the operators of the ramp should easily be able to afford to maintain the property.  I really don't get the ""free for locals"" deal.  You use the ramp you should pay for it.  I much rather pay a fee for a quality ramp than launch at someplace sketchy for free.  why I should pay for other people to use it is beyond me.  -AA"
854018,Sinker,2014-05-16 21:19:00,8692,"Simcoe sucks anyways. Why anyone would pay $25 to launch there is beyond me. Why not spend that money and drive a little further to a nice lake without the crowds, and wingnuts. Charging $25 to launch a boat is highway robbery. I mean really, now can they justify that?  S."

854033,Sinker,2014-05-17 00:55:00,8692,"Label me all ya want....do you really think I care? LOL...I couldnt care less!!  Simcoe is a crazy busy lake year round. Every time I go there I run into scumbags, ignorance, etc. It would have to be the last lake in the world for me to pay $25 to put my boat in. If it werent for the perch, i'd never lay eyes on it!  S."
854038,kickingfrog,2014-05-17 01:48:00,8333,Launching a float tube is free.. How big of a rubber band do you use in that slingshot?
854040,bigugli,2014-05-17 02:06:00,6138," If I wanna fish the northern shore of Lake O I pay to park/launch, what's the difference? Along the west shore of Lake Ontario outsiders and residents pay the same .At St Kitts that's $12 a day.  There is also a huge difference between  public and private facilities. If a private facility offers a price break to it's members so be it.  And before we get on the subject of taxpayer burden, just remember that many of the public launches , facilities, and waterfront renewals  were built, in large part, with provincial and federal funds. I contracted on many of those projects."
854047,glen,2014-05-17 04:56:00,2641,I wish they would charge more money that way it would be easier for me to find a place to park.
853587,EME411,2014-05-14 00:43:00,13,That's expensive launch and parking. The town launch is free at the point.
853680,chefboi17,2014-05-14 16:35:00,128,"I heard a rumour that they were gonna start charging for the tiffins launch. It really is unfortunate, if the cost to park was reasonable, I would be ok with paying a little. But instead they are driving people away with the high cost"
853683,kickingfrog,2014-05-14 16:45:00,8333,The tiffin pay parking is a done deal. The city even found a away to make it a giant pain for the residents even while giving them free passes.

853717,Gerritt,2014-05-14 19:32:00,6129,I think that's the point. To drive folks away they are sick of the slobs and pigs

853719,jimmer,2014-05-14 19:37:00,2730,Sounds like they are meeting their goal to discourage outsiders from using the lake if others feel that's what they are doing.
853723,Fisherman,2014-05-14 19:47:00,7201,"The not so funny thing is that the locals (Brian et al not included) have problems with getting their Timmy cups into the garbage cans too.  Seen that a few times where the local strollers along the waterfront try for a hoop shot, miss and walk on.  At least they have a blue Johnny rocket at the launch, no more peeing in the bushes."
853731,kickingfrog,2014-05-14 21:07:00,8333,"As it currently stands the residents of Barrie who receive water bills will get one parking pass in the mail with their bill. The one pass can have a max of two plates listed on it. No solutions for people who might have more then 2 cars at one residents.  For the thousands of people who do not get a water bill other arrangements can be made. Have fun with that, since Barrie city council has been making this up as they go.  And as someone pointed out, the time for the paid parking (the launch is free, for now) is coming soon but few have received their pass."
853850,Oggie,2014-05-15 18:26:00,588,"I think I'll put a bug in Centre Wellington's ear. We used taxpayers money to build steps down to the Grand River and to prepare parking lots (with street lights)  at access points. We've published maps(for out of towners) and organized a volunteer group to pickup garbage and stock the river (Friends of the Grand River). FOGR petitioned the MNR to pass special fishing regulations to ensure a good brown trout population wouldn't get stripped from the river every year.  That's enough of that Bull, I want special priviledges as a taxpayer of  Fergus/Elora.  I want a parking ban on most side streets and a special pass to park in our access lots.  Why should Barrie and Innisfil be the only municipalities collecting money off of anglers? DanO."
853856,Steve,2014-05-15 19:19:00,2075,"who pays to stock Simcoe?  Just local townsfolk, or all of Ontario tax payers / Fishing License holders?  It appears we all pay to stock, but only locals get to enjoy for free....outsiders have to pay to stock, and pay to use.  sounds like a fair plan."
853857,kickingfrog,2014-05-15 19:23:00,8333,User fees; when governments pretend not to raise taxes.
853863,misfish,2014-05-15 19:51:00,29133,"If any out of towners want to fish Simcoe from Barrie,let me know. We can use my pass and you can take me fishing for free.  I knew this pass thing could come to some good.."

Why not tell them to stuff their boat ramp and give your hard earned money to someone who'll actually appreciate it.  Course that's just my take on what I read around here."
853882,bigugli,2014-05-15 21:21:00,6138,"Perhaps funding for stocking the lakes should only come from the local ratepayers. It seems every year some group of ratepayers, in one town or another, wants to restrict or limit access to their local waterways.

853459,BillM,2014-05-13 12:21:00,17367,I think it has to do more with revenue generation
