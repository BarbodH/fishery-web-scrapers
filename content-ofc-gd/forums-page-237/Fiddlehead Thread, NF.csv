I found a few morel mushrooms growing in my back yard this week. Ate 3 but the squirrels are getting them as they're coming up.  That's exactly how I do it too."

Hmmm...if that's the going rate I might just have to pick a bunch more and put a sign at the end of the driveway.  5-6 lbs per hour x $7 lb = $35 - $42 an hour to be out in the bush picking fiddleheads seems like a fair deal to me."
854034,Rod Caster,2014-05-17 01:03:00,5784,We ate our first meal of Fiddleheads tonight. I put them in a souvlaki/tsaziki/rice wrap.

They're relatively easy to find near marshy and swampy area's, especially around the Grand. The easiest time to find new patches is in the summer when the plants are fully grown and easily seen Return in the spring and harvest.   Had another large serving of the Dryads again last night...fried with bacon."

853116,turtle,2014-05-11 09:50:00,274,I find wild leeks in hardwood forests like a sugar maple bush in rich soil where its not too thick and they get good sunlight.  One of the first green plants to come up in the spring.
853156,123chadder,2014-05-11 15:50:00,165,got a wack yesterday.......they taste different than i remember......like corn and spinach mixed.....deliscious!

The real shade cover areas are still brown clumps.      Managed to find a pod that gave me enough for tonights dinner.   Steamed then fried with sweet chillie and black bean garlic sauce."

853212,Rod Caster,2014-05-11 22:30:00,5784,Dont eat those Joey! Poison man. Edible fiddleheads are almost always on sandy river banks.

853216,Joeytier,2014-05-11 22:56:00,3990,Good to know!!  Lol they weren't in a typical spot and were much bigger than the small ones growing down by the ravine
853286,Headhunter,2014-05-12 13:05:00,5703,Those look great Brian... if only you had some smelt to go with that! LOL HH
853296,ch312,2014-05-12 14:45:00,1590,Was out yesterday and filled a 2 gallon bucket with fiddleheads in about 75 minutes with another 7 or 8 dryads on the side. I think i'll head out again today to grab a couple more gallons worth to make sure we have enough in the freezer.   I've been watching for the leeks but haven't seen a single plant. I think i'm looking in the wrong spots?
853301,misfish,2014-05-12 15:01:00,29133,"No smelt Joe, just a nice roasted ham. You wizenhimer"

Spotted a ton of dryads, but left those in the bush as i'm mushroomed out. I wonder if they can be dried and stored to be used later on?   "

852331,Bill Shearer,2014-05-06 21:56:00,456,"I was out on another stream on Monday in your area, and didn't see any! I made it a point to look for some since the fishing was slow. I did see a few deer, and a hawk that didn't make it through the winter. Very strange spring!"
852332,Joeytier,2014-05-06 21:59:00,3990,Can't wait for the fiddleheads to start up here.  Gonna be at least a week but i saw a couple starting to sprout last weekend
852352,dracokaos,2014-05-07 00:00:00,116,whats your favourite recipe for fiddleheads???
852353,i2cool2fool,2014-05-07 00:13:00,349,"Steamed or boiled (drained) with a pat of butter, salt/pepper and splash or two of vinegar. Oh yeah... with boiled taters and fresh Atlantic Salmon helps (else rainbow or speckled trout).  That's how I was raised in New Brunswick."
852354,i2cool2fool,2014-05-07 00:15:00,349,Enjoy Chris! I am jealous.
852356,chris.brock,2014-05-07 00:34:00,4053,"favourite recipe-  roll them around in balsamic vinegar and olive oil, then a quick grill on the BBQ (I know some people say they should be cooked thoroughly, so use at your own risk)"
852357,dracokaos,2014-05-07 00:42:00,116,I've had them once when i was a lot younger and not concerned about how it was cooked...lol  I guess I'm gona have to go searching....
852379,Rod Caster,2014-05-07 01:39:00,5784,"Can't wait for fiddlehead season. I plan on freezing a bunch this year.  If you want to stock your freezer, make sure you blanche them first. Freezing them non-blanched is a waste of good fiddleheads."
852383,Nipfisher,2014-05-07 01:46:00,2449,I checked on Sunday and they have broke ground but still not sprouted yet.
852385,Rod Caster,2014-05-07 01:47:00,5784,I checked on Sunday and they have broke ground but still not sprouted yet. Good to know. I'm looking for new spots closer to home.
852388,Nipfisher,2014-05-07 02:01:00,2449,My spot is within walking distance.
852392,kuhaman,2014-05-07 02:09:00,503,Nice bike. What kind?
852407,turtle,2014-05-07 11:13:00,274,"Yesterday morning I picked my first fiddleheads this year.  Ate them last night steamed for 10 minutes then add butter & lemon juice. Wild leeks have been up for about 2 weeks.  Out turkey hunting, still no turkey but had a mature doe walk right up to me within 15M before she made me and ran off."

Amazing how fast they come on, same stretch of river I fished opener and they weren't even showing then. Yesterday most were over a foot and a half high! Took a lot of work to find the smaller ones that were just sprouting. If you're in SW ON get out and look for them now or you'll miss out."
852448,ch312,2014-05-07 14:27:00,1590,"Fried in some butter and seasoned with salt and pepper is the only way to go. Boiling them extracts too much of the flavor and nutrients. As with any plant, if you insist on using water to cook them you should really opt for steaming to preserve the natural flavor and nutrients.  They can definitely be eaten raw in small quantities (as in a small handful) with no ill effects. I have munched on raw fiddleheads while picking every spring for the last 10+ years.    I'm heading out in a couple hours to get my usual 3-5 gallons worth for the yearly supply. Hopefully it's not too late around here..."
852476,ch312,2014-05-07 18:31:00,1590,"Well, give the fiddleheads another couple weeks in the Brantford area. I just got home and every single fiddlehead hump I saw had zero heads sprouting.

But before I eat them,I will post a pic to be sure they are Dryadss..   It's pretty hard to mistake them for something else. The underside and inner flesh is white, they can be easily broken/snapped, and they smell exactly like watermelon rinds.  Stick to the smaller and more tender dryads as they tend to get tougher as the size increases. Like other mushrooms, simply fry in butter at med-high heat and season with salt and pepper."
