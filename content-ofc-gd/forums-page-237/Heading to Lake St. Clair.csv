Going to put the boat in the lake on Sunday most likely and was wondering if anyone on this forum had any success out there so far. Anyone fishing walleye near the mouth of the river by peche island? What depth water or lures are you using to catch what species if you have had success? Any/all advice is welcome, just want to put my old man on some fish!  Thanks again,  pairofgreenhorns"
853994,mpt,2014-05-16 16:07:00,158,Reports have been good from Peche to the bridge. The silvers are in but better on the east side.
853996,lew,2014-05-16 16:10:00,12766,I don't fish for pickerel but from what I hear the guys usually do good jigging while drifting down the Detroit River.

I usually always put us on the fish but my dads gps broke and I lost all my way points. I know a couple spots to hit up but wanted to see if things had changed much due to our late spring/ice out. Thanks for the replies gentlemen!"
