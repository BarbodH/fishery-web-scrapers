Fishing was a little slow at first largely due to low water temps but things have steadily improved and we have been doing quite well lately.  I started using the new navionics plus card and just wanted to show some pictures of the chart sets with and without the fish n chip layer activated.  Here is a picture of an area of Picton Bay without the fish n chip layer activated.    This would be the same level of data you have on the Gold card.  If you have a Navionics Platinum plus, Hotmaps platinum, Plus or Updates Card.  You can go into chart options and turn on the ""fish n chip"" layer.  Here is what the same area looks like with the fish n chip layer turned on.  You can see the significantly increased chart data.    This is the same as turning on the ""sonar charts"" layer if you have the navionics + in app upgrade on the mobile app.  Scott"
