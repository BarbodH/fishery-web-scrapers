How does it know?    The lake was in pretty good condition with only a couple of sketchy areas.    For those of you you think Honda's are only good for taking the kids to soccer practice and picking up groceries, they are pretty capable with decent tires and the center locking differential engaged. She walked right up the rocks no problem.        "
