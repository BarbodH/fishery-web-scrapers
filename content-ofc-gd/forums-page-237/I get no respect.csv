852648,jimmer,2014-05-08 15:31:00,2730,At least you can rule those places out. That's crappy customer service.
852649,Sinker,2014-05-08 15:52:00,8692,Try calling. I find using internet contact us links useless.  S.

Man, the duct cleaners were calling constantly. First I was polite and said no thanks. Then I started telling them that I heat with electric baseboards and have no ducts. They still called, so I let them speak with the boss...    Yup the dog, after Duke howled at them a few times, they stopped calling.  In response to your post, try to find a phone number where you can talk to an actual person. If not, it wasn't meant to be."

853820,Carp,2014-05-15 12:32:00,1488,"That was funny Tootsie ll.  I usually tell them my brother is in the business and just cleaned my ducts and furnace recently. It seems to work for most of them. Same for windows. I'm fairly tolerant of these telemarketers. They're trying to make a buck to feed themselves or their family. The ones that are too agressive and won't accept NO, get raked over the coals for disturbing my beauty rest. I NEED AS MUCH AS I CAN GET !!!"
