I had a good 3-4 lb speck on for a little while until it broke off my 4 lb test and i could see it swimming around with my float, can't even imagine how annoying that is! It hit again after dozens of casts with a #3 spinner, unfortunately it didnt swallow it well and came off, however i did get my float back! Still has my $5 jig in its mouth though so i will be back later this week, to pick that back up, lol. After that i got tired of break ors and i only had 4 lb test, so i hit the tiny creek that flows into it to see if i could get some baby specks, well i managed some tiny little specks with my bud (compared to what I'm used to), all in all a good day but very disappointing, going back to using 8 lb test, they were taking worms/minnows as well as spinners but they seemed to like live bait better today, the tiny guys didn't really care as long as it moved, haha. Here are some pics:[/url[/url[/url[/url"

Everyone i tell doesn't believe me until i show them a pic of the big ones, then i decided to keep my mouth shut, lol, the people walking by almost fainted when they saw me pulling in a big speck that was peeling line and jumping out of the water, haha, it got off, i told them it was a catfish so they don't come back with 20 guys. I had my bud with me, wasn't having luck fishing so he was my camera man for the day!"
