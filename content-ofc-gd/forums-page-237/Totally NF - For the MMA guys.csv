853833,mattybculp,2014-05-15 14:27:00,388,That's ridiculous! He will have to have his hands registered as lethal weapons by age 5.

853847,NAW,2014-05-15 16:59:00,4022,"That's pretty sad if you ask me, and I'm a big fan of MMA. I can see your point.  It's a bit scary training a young child to that high of a level.  But these days, people are starting to train their kids to be pro athletes at younger and younger ages.  It some sports, it's almost a requirement if you want to make it pro.  I teach martial arts to some very young children.  Younger than the kid in the video (I think, I'm guessing his age at 4 or 5)..  The most important thing to teach kids (well before you teach them anything like what's in this video) is to respect others, and to NEVER use the techniques unless it's life or death...  We make it very clear, if you ever use these techniques out of place, you're no longer welcome to train at the studio.  I was taught the same way by my Sensei.  I;ve seen many students get kick out of our studio because they where fighting in the school yard."

853859,lew,2014-05-15 19:31:00,12766,"That's one little guy that'll never, ever, have to worry about bullies LOL"
853862,misfish,2014-05-15 19:48:00,29133," Yup,that was and is the rule today in alot of classes still..  That was something to watch Nick. You see that hand jump from the upper cut? WOW."
853870,NAW,2014-05-15 20:17:00,4022,"For a a kid that's 20 months old that's INSANE , unbelievable coordination , balance, and the ability to process instruction that rapidly. Talk about natural athletic ability. Oh, this kid is at least 4 I think...  Just a rough guess.  But still..  It's crazy to see someone that young processing things that fast.  Its almost like they put part of it in fast forward..."
853873,Terry,2014-05-15 20:22:00,14456,"wow, that kid could kick the crap out of me   look out GSP"
853874,davey buoy,2014-05-15 20:23:00,5505,"wow, that kid could kick the crap out of me   look out GSP Maybe your right Terry,I thought I could still take him lol."
853875,NAW,2014-05-15 20:27:00,4022,The kid actually has sloppy technique.  But his speed and power are great!  I think you could take him Terry

853895,Rustic-Fisher,2014-05-15 22:39:00,826,"Thought 20 months was a little strange , Still impressive though ."
853947,Twocoda,2014-05-16 03:10:00,4130,i dont see a problem with it ...its a sport and one that is disciplined ...even if he never enters competitions he will be healthy and possess a greater understanding of combat and respect ...
