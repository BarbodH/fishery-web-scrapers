853905,redpearl99,2014-05-15 23:05:00,259,I'll be going there this weekend.... has anyone fished that area and have any advice??  what kind of fish should I be targeting? any pike?
853908,chris.brock,2014-05-15 23:21:00,4053,"I've never fished it, this is just the word on the street,  for a few years, some older guys took small walleye from Head Lk and threw them in South.........."
853941,mukluk,2014-05-16 02:30:00,196,Fished it back in the 70's and caught smallies and largemouth bass.  Perch and catfish as well.
853942,redpearl99,2014-05-16 02:40:00,259,this doesnt seem very promising guys since bass season is closed
853954,SmokestackLightnin,2014-05-16 10:55:00,390,It's a bass lake.  There are walleye in Canning or Kashagawigamog which are very close to South.
853958,snagmaster,2014-05-16 11:48:00,250,Ive fished the lake...Bass and perch...no walleye. Very flat and featureless.Nothing really to target now.
