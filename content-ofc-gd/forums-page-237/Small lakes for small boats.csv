853693,wigler,2014-05-14 17:26:00,15,"My buddy just purchased a small Pelican boat from Costco.  He put a trolling motor on the back.  He seems to think we can launch this thing anywhere but I have concerns.  Not sure I would want to be in it on a larger lake.  So my questions is does anyone have any recommendations on lakes/'ponds' south east of Newmarket.  Somewhere in the Kawartha's I would think.  I have spent some time looking at Google maps, but it is hard to know what you are looking at without driving there.  I don't think we would need a launch, just a shore where we could carry and put this thing in.  I suppose we could hit a larger lake and put it in a small bay?  Thoughts?  Thanks.  Wigler"

853750,Christopheraaron,2014-05-14 23:33:00,3525,"Mitchell is a good lake for small boat for sure, look at rivers too, the Holland is in your area and has some decent fishing."
853768,sofabed,2014-05-15 01:20:00,119,Mitchell or Canal lake would be good. Deer Bay on Lower Buckhorn is sheltered as long as you keep to the wind side and offers good fishing opportunities as well
