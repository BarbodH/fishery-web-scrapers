Was wondering if it was worth it to try Dunnville for a few Silvers, usually Detroit River has a run but with the weather we've had i don't think it would have started yet, unless someone knows different ?Afraz"
853689,Fisher_1,2014-05-14 17:05:00,22,In the past week or so the Silvers have been slowly coming in. Its mostly guys out in the river going for walleyes getting them but some guys from shore have been catching a few.
853713,CRAPPIE,2014-05-14 18:57:00,213,Where about it. Would like to bring my family for a try.  Thanks

I wish i could get into a few on the North Shore closer to home, but don't look forward to pulling out the big rig in the middle of winter to hit the outflow - had enough of winter for a few years"
