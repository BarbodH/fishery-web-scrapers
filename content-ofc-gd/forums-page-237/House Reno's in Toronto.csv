853853,Gregoire,2014-05-15 18:45:00,1397,"Hi All,  I was reading the ""I get not respect"" thread, and am struggling as well with finding contractors in Toronto to do work on a house that I recently bought. I figured I would post here as every person that I have met and dealt with from OFC has been an upstanding individual.  I am looking to have a few things done:  Repairs to the wooden exterior of my house. Some of the boards are rotted and need replacing. In addition, the eave troughs and awnings needs to be replaced or fixed.  Reno's to the garage, I would like to replace the 2 single doors with a double door and open up the interior. There is currently a beam running down the middle of the garage, so a beam will need to be put in to reinforce the roof.  A window in the basement is rotted, and needs to be replaced. I would like a window well and an easement installed.  Parging needs to be done to the cement exterior.  I will also need the exterior of the house repainted.  Windows on the main floor either need the counter weights fixed, or need a retro-fit.  If there is money left over in the budget I would also like to get stairs installed from the second floor deck to the backyard.  I also own a property in the west end, just off of Roncesvales, that needs a new roof and new stairs installed.  That is all I can think of right now. There are probably a few other jobs to do. I am sure that I have enough work to keep an industrious individual busy for at least month or two. There is another house off of Roncesvalles that my fiancee partially owns, and generally needs some work done on it a few times a year, so the potential is there for fairly regular work.  If you are interested in doing this work, or know someone who does work like this please shoot me a PM   Greg AKA Roaring Dan Seavey"
