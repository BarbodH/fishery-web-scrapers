853751,hotsky,2014-05-14 23:35:00,400,"Went fishing with the wife this past weekend at a lower Grand River. Bites seemed often but light, very light! When I hoocked this fish the bobber didn't even submerg completely, I was expecing a small perch picking at the worm. Turned out to be my first trout! Never really fished for them so dont even know what it is...  Also cought a perch and bullhead, wife cought a bullhead and a sheephead/drum all on a worm under a bobber (except my catfish). Probably going back this weekend    "
853753,DRIFTER_016,2014-05-14 23:38:00,10439,That would be a steelhead (AKA Migratory rainbow trout)
853754,timmeh,2014-05-14 23:39:00,609,Rainbow (or steelhead if you prefer).
853756,hotsky,2014-05-14 23:45:00,400,"Thanks! Rainbow was my guess but wasn't 100% sure. So they're from Lake Eire I'm guessing, how much longer will they hang around before returning to the lake? I read the trout like the cold and come in after salmon run."
853757,ketchenany,2014-05-14 23:46:00,3229,"The guys above are not wrong, good catch!"
853758,Christopheraaron,2014-05-14 23:48:00,3525,"Nice catch! The Grand river steelhead fishery is mostly a fall fishery (as far as I know, correct me if I'm wrong) so I'd say you got very lucky getting to catch one so late! You may get another this spring but you'll certainly do better if you go down in around October."
853759,spincast,2014-05-14 23:50:00,3279,beauty first trout - congrats.  Once they figure out they're hooked they are usually a whole different feel from that first gentle bite. There's a reason they're called silver bullets.Get them in the lake in summer for some fine acrobatics
853810,davey buoy,2014-05-15 08:00:00,5505,What a great assortment of fish in that river.Nice first steelhead!!!!!!!!
853816,Carp,2014-05-15 11:59:00,1488,Congrats on your first.
853826,BowSlayer101,2014-05-15 13:38:00,296,"Thats a beauty steelie and your first to boot! I wouldn't say the grand is mostly only fall for steelhead, spring gets a big run as well, the tributaries of the grand get a good run as well as long as you're in the right place at the right time."
853851,JerMac,2014-05-15 18:30:00,37,Conrats!  nice one too!!
853891,lickmyarmpit,2014-05-15 21:54:00,359,That River gets a lot of bows spring and fall the problem is so much water to cover.  I've pulled a few beauts out of there mid winter is all about timing. Nice fish. ....
853937,Moosebunk,2014-05-16 02:00:00,3970,Good show!  Congrats on your first trout.  What a treat for ya man!
854079,Rich,2014-05-17 21:56:00,3927,They will be around until mid June this year I'm guessing. Normally gone by opener.  Nice fish!
