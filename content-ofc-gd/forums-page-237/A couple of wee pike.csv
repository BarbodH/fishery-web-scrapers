The small pike were easily found but the walleyes were not. Kept 2 pike to have with tonight's asparagus risotto.  Missed a few nice hits trolling (tried to tell ourselves that they were bass). Also had a few largies in the bays with the pike and a few smallies trolling for eyes in the deeper water.      Family road trip to the Memorial Cup tomorrow."
854093,Rizzo,2014-05-18 02:17:00,4754,Nice! Glad to see you getting out. My boat is out of storage but odds are it'll be mid June before it hits water...sigh
854095,moxie,2014-05-18 03:02:00,1566,"Sure beats staying home. 14 Eyes today of which only one was just under 22""mixed in with a healthy smattering of Bass. Bellies on the three we kept were empty and two still had loaded milt sacs. Figuring the fish are at least a week away from putting on the feed bag."

854107,Tim Mills,2014-05-18 11:58:00,476,Nice report.  Looks like you guys had the lake to yourself. Do you cook the fish in the risotto or seperately?
854158,kickingfrog,2014-05-18 19:22:00,8333,Separate. The pike was very good but grilled salmon is still the best thing I've had with risotto.
854161,misfish,2014-05-18 20:00:00,29133,salmon is still the best thing I've had with risotto.  Atlantic
