852901,trophypikehunter,2014-05-09 20:21:00,89,Everybody this is a Hobo who's name is Hobo!  I found this vagrant wondering the tracks so I decided to give him a meal and a warm bed and he hasnt left since.. He claims to be a Karelian Bear Dog and promises to protect me against any unruly bruins. All I need todo is feed and shelter him for the next 13-15 years...  I'm in!!!!!!!  :clapping:

852906,d_paluch,2014-05-09 20:45:00,343,"cute puppy!  love hearing stories like this. Always puts a smile to my face, especially when there's pictures"
852907,leaf4,2014-05-09 20:47:00,2466,"nice looking dog! I've never heard of that breed till now in doing some reading it makes sense why, as they sound like a fantastic breed for hunters and not a typical city dog lol need a lot of space and aggressive in some instances, beautiful looking dogs they are though!"

852982,bigugli,2014-05-10 07:46:00,6138,Don't often see that breed this side of the Atlantic.  Cute.
852987,limeyangler,2014-05-10 09:09:00,5204,COOL.
853179,dracokaos,2014-05-11 17:19:00,116,Right on....but seriously who could have said no.....lol
853191,NAW,2014-05-11 19:35:00,4022,"Very odd find.  Those are expensive dogs,  with very few breeders in Ontario.  My best friend breeds them and owns 2.  Watch out how you train Hobo..  KBD's have a bad rap for biting people.  They are an extremely strong minded dog..   Someone likely paid a few grand for the pup!!"
853292,bassassin,2014-05-12 14:09:00,152,its sad theres some many dogs out there that need a good home its mind boggling.... Good on ya for taking the plunge....
853303,DanD,2014-05-12 15:31:00,2223,"Not to rain on this; but have to reported that you've found a lost dog to animal control or the cops? A dog of this caliber likely was not abandoned? It might be hard to give him up, if the owners did come looking; but if he were mine that became lost I'd want him back.  Dan. "
853340,trophypikehunter,2014-05-12 20:13:00,89,Sorry to miss lead you guys but I did pay for Hobo..  Just thought because his name was Hobo I wouild make a funny store for his intro.   I do appreciate the concern in the PM's as I would want my lost dog back too.  Here's anpther pic!! 
853343,NAW,2014-05-12 20:20:00,4022,You can't trick OFC!!  We are all knowing!!
853472,Gerritt,2014-05-13 13:32:00,6129,I think a lot of us were able to read between the lines.  G
