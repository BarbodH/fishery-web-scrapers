853887,lickmyarmpit,2014-05-15 21:49:00,359,"Caught this beauty up near Algonquin Park there is also splake in the lake, you can't see the fishes tail in either pic but it was square and released quickly.  What do ya think beauty splake? Or I just crushed my pb by more than a pound and 5-6 inches?"
853893,chris.brock,2014-05-15 22:01:00,4053,"I would say splake, but other guys here might know better  are the brookies natural or stocked in the lake you were on? I'm guessing stocked  I think splake usually look more like lakers but sometimes the brookie genetics manifest themselves  I caught this in a splake only lake    regardless, a beauty fish!"
853917,Joeytier,2014-05-16 00:18:00,3990,"Yeah looks like a splake to me, and a beauty one at that!"
853919,solopaddler,2014-05-16 00:31:00,8605,"Beauty fish, congrat's! I'll say splake as well."
853921,Sinker,2014-05-16 00:40:00,8692,Id say splake too! A beauty at that! Congrats!  S.
853924,lickmyarmpit,2014-05-16 00:48:00,359,It's a natural speck and stocked splake/laker Lake.  The reason I think speckie is the square tail and black mouth either way a beauty of a fish Here's a rainbow from the same Lake by far my favorite early trout spot.
853926,chris.brock,2014-05-16 00:53:00,4053,"it's odd that the MNR would stock splake/ lakers and bows in a naturally reproducing brookie lake  regardless, nice catch and it seems like you have a hidden gem there"
853936,Moosebunk,2014-05-16 01:59:00,3970,"Gonna go with splake, a congrats and nice fish too dood!"
853939,35Wailin,2014-05-16 02:24:00,59,"The biologists need to count the little fingers off the stomach to make a positive ID, so I don't think you can tell just by looking at it...  Beauty fish either way. "
853940,kickingfrog,2014-05-16 02:27:00,8333,And ^that^ makes em tough to release.  Beautiful fish.
853952,solopaddler,2014-05-16 10:47:00,8605,"The biologists need to count the little fingers off the stomach to make a positive ID, so I don't think you can tell just by looking at it...     Actually in many cases you can tell by looking at the fish, or at least make an educated guess. If the original poster had done nothing other than post a pic of the fish I'd have thought ""nice splke""."
853956,dave524,2014-05-16 11:15:00,4508,"A little long and lanky for a lake resident Brookie, I found they tend to be shorter and more stocky, I'd say Splake based on the laker like profile."
853963,BillM,2014-05-16 12:01:00,17367,Looks like a splake to me.  Either way it's a nice fish!
854002,Tim Mills,2014-05-16 17:22:00,476,Nice fish for both of you.
854039,S.M.05,2014-05-17 01:59:00,145,"While some splake can have square tails and very similar markings to that of specs making them hard to distinguish other than by counting the pyloric caeca. This one has too many features that suggest it to be a splake.-red muted spots / lacks definition in halos/spots-Darkness of fish-SlendernessWhile specs may exhibit some of the above, to exhibit all suggest splake.Here is a beautiful splake a buddy caught yrs ago. Notice the perfectly square tail.Definition of the spots/ halos on this spec.and a splake from last weekend. (Muted spots, darkness in color)Either way a very nice fish. Splake and specs, love fishing for them both.I'm sure he gave you a awesome fight and an even better snack."
