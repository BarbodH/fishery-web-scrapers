Thank goodness me butt was not in the water.LOL    When I seen his with the added horse power,I was thankful, as I forgot me flippers. It sure does scoot along .      One for the team.    Lots of fish,just not as active as they were yesterday."
854226,Terry,2014-05-19 16:07:00,14456,that little electric sure moves fast
854227,DRIFTER_016,2014-05-19 16:23:00,10439,"Yep, they go pretty good with a little electric motivation.  "
854228,misfish,2014-05-19 16:24:00,29133,"Terry,you see those full blown pontoons??????????  Nice Dave"
854229,misfish,2014-05-19 16:33:00,29133,"The addition of the electronics was nice to have. Just bunged it to the pontoon,stored the battery in the side pocket. The transducer just floats in front of the seat out of the way."
854234,irishfield,2014-05-19 17:13:00,26272,Crazy buggers you are... you have perfectly good boats to use and instead you can't resist kicking your feet in the COLD water!
854238,BillM,2014-05-19 17:24:00,17367,I refuse to paddle my pontoon anymore after using the electric on the back
854242,misfish,2014-05-19 17:35:00,29133,Crazy buggers you are... you have perfectly good boats to use and instead you can't resist kicking your feet in the COLD water!   ADVENTUROUS Wayne ADVENTUROUS. LMAO

854244,Fisherman,2014-05-19 17:49:00,7201,Did you see the billions of shiners at the launch this morning? Just crazy.

I have seen it done; an electric motor, not down riggers  I saw it on a fishing show.  They had an auxiliary tube for the electric motor that was attached to a donought style flow tube."
854248,misfish,2014-05-19 18:28:00,29133,Did you see the billions of shiners at the launch this morning? Just crazy.  Shiners are every where Erich. I even found them in a trib creek this morning. Way up the creek. Suckers galour as well.
854250,davey buoy,2014-05-19 18:32:00,5505,"Did you see the billions of shiners at the launch this morning? Just crazy. Yesterday at the launch was crazy as well.Boats going in and out,and schools of minnows around my feet while loading the boat.Haven't seen it like that before."
854252,misfish,2014-05-19 18:40:00,29133,"The marina is full of pinheads. Looks like the larger ones have staged in the lake. The fountian is also loaded. I have only seen this many in the fall,never the spring time. Simcoe is making a major rebound IMO. Bigger fish coming soon."
