854162,adempsey,2014-05-18 20:50:00,1498,"Looking for a new pair of waterproof boots for hiking/fishing in Spring, Summer and Fall.  Any recommendations for something in the  $100 to $125 price range?  My last pair was a BPS brand (Red Head) and they fell apart fairly quickly.    I did visit BPS last month, but couldn't find anything that I liked.  For reference, I do love my Baffin Titans that I use for ice fishing.  They cost me $100.  My local stores are TSC, CT, Mark's Work Warehouse, MEC and Sportschek.  Thanks!"

854176,solopaddler,2014-05-18 23:20:00,8605,I also have a pair of Keen hiking boots for bushwhacking. For fishing in a boat or where there's little walking involved I have a pair of insulated Bogs rubber boots. I probably wear those 70% of the time.
854188,Ainsley,2014-05-19 02:56:00,142,I've always bought merrells in the past but my latest pair are teva with an event membrane.  I've been very happy with them so far.
854193,adempsey,2014-05-19 06:10:00,1498,"Thanks.  A few local stores carry those brands so I will check them out.  I never knew Bogs even made anything but those brightly colored winter boots with flowers an butterflies on them.   I bought a pair for my daughter last winter because they looked like they would be great winter boots [albeit, a bit on the heavy side as the now worn out sole demonstrates]."
854198,Burtess,2014-05-19 12:32:00,901,"I wear Irish Setter Wingshooter's.  I have the shorter ones, 7"".  They are uninsulated and give very good ankle and foot support.  Haven't been wet in them yet. http://hunt.irishsetterboots.com/irishsetter-shoe/807-irish-setter/807-irish-setter-hunt-mens-7-inch-boot-auburn  I picked them up at Sail for around $120 on sale.

854208,Sinker,2014-05-19 13:36:00,8692,"I have a pair of irish setters as well that I like. They're lower cut, but great for hiking/fishing, and my feet havent been wet yet. You wont be walking thru deep puddles, or wading in them, but they are comfy and dry. I think they are called ""hunt"".  S."
