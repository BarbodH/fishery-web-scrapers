Her mother had found the PERFECT dress to wear, and would be the best-dressed mother-of-the-bride ever! A week later, the bride-to-be was horrified to learn that her father's new, young wife had bought the exact same dress as her mother! The bride-to-be asked her father's new young wife to exchange it, but she refused. ''Absolutely not! I look like a million bucks in this dress, and I'm wearing it,'' she replied.
