550859,GBW,2011-02-12 22:33:00,8460,Hey all.  Anyone know where I can get another handle and arm?  It's off my Ice Lightning rod/reel combo.  I just went to check on my gear for tomorrow and I found the one on my UL is busted off.  I got it last year so is there warranty to cover it without a bill from my purchase?   Thanks.  Geoff
550866,Gregoire,2011-02-12 22:51:00,1397,I had an issue with a revo winch that I bought last year. I went back and forth with them until I got in contact with Jordan Schwantz. Try sending him an email to this address [emailÂ protected] Good luck
