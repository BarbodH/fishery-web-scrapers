551170,irishfield,2011-02-13 21:05:00,26272,"Yes.. they stock Temagami for eye's in limited numbers... although I think everything they tried to hatch/raise last year died due to the ponds going dry.  Very little snow up North compared to here.. haven't heard any issues with slush at this time, but John the Fisherman would have a current status on that for ya..as he lives on Bear Island."
