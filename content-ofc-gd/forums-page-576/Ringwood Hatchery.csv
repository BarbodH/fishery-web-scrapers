550288,Roy,2011-02-11 10:07:00,13728,"Thanks John. Although I know nothing of the inner workings of this, reading it once over as I have, it smells fishy to me."
550567,esoxansteel,2011-02-12 01:14:00,1307,"Just wondered how for 5 years the MNR could not run Ringwood when the MEA with support from the OFAH ran it well, and all of a sudden they feel they are able to once again jump back on the band wagon, at least the fish were bigger and more of them when it was run privately, they should be stocking more cohos instead of dumping them altogether, maybe the MNR could find another Austrailian wine company to fund a steelhead and coho stocking program.  "

550679,chessy,2011-02-12 15:34:00,610,they my not need to raise that many salmon or trout seeing the limit may be going to two trout out in lake ontario . alot of charters will close up shop at only alloweing two rainbows per person . people may not want to spend money for only two fish
