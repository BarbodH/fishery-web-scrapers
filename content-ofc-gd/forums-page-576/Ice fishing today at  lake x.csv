I can get the lakers, browns and bows to come by and sniff/bump my lure as usuall.To get them to bite, well not today.  In lew of how the day went, I did manage to be entertained by a new fishy pet for an hr or so.lol  Anywhoo, I packed to hit another hole in the area, noticed that perch were lurking, so I set up fo them. At this point I really didnt care if I caught a fish. So I set up a nice tip up that Leechman kindly sent to me last week. A little expermenting with the wind/ lure, I had it down packed with Leechmans creation The twin stayed home  Jacques those are really nice tip up rods One day, they will catch me a fish, for sure. And Thanks a ton Jacques  On to the pics   "
