550712,Rich,2011-02-12 16:32:00,3927,"I understand it's a pay-to-play reservoir, I understand there's small pike and small crappies to be caught. I'm just looking for info on if it's worth the drive for pike action, if not, any better suggestions? Just looking for a change of scenery. Chances are, I won't be back for another year... and I wont keep anything more than a half dozen eater crappies (not big ones or little guys). PM if you'd rather!"
550722,Spiel,2011-02-12 16:49:00,9065,"I would suggest it's not worth the drive for you Rich.  My brother fished it frequently when he lived near by, never did he get excited about it. Just a close to home destination he could take his kids to for a few hours.  Valens and Belwood would offer better pike fishing but they're not under pressured by any standards."
550732,jediangler,2011-02-12 17:04:00,1923,"I have no experience on Shades through the ice Rich. It does hold crappies, perch and bass as well as some snot rocket pike. I wouldn't drive more than 30 minutes to get there. Maybe try Guelph or Orangeville."
550738,fishing n autograph,2011-02-12 17:13:00,2540,shades mill is a good summer play ground. lost of good size bass to be had
550755,Rich,2011-02-12 17:40:00,3927,Hmm. Thanks for the info guys.
550816,danbouck,2011-02-12 20:52:00,4380,"Not worth the drive, I will be out there tomorrow with my 4 year old though for his first time ice fishing."
550829,vinnimon,2011-02-12 21:16:00,2593,"  Dan, do they charge to walk in there? And is the gate open?  Rich , my one time experience there with doubt, actually turned out very well for me. Caught a decent size pike while untangling my lines. The only fish that was caught that day and never went back since."
550858,danbouck,2011-02-12 22:33:00,4380, yes they charge to walk in. It's 4 or 5 bucks
550903,vinnimon,2011-02-13 00:19:00,2593,"  Better off at little lake, and no fees Not really worth the drive either. Heck of a shorter walk."
551008,Cookslav,2011-02-13 03:53:00,1457,"Its not known for monsters however you can Pike up to 30"" Thats the best I've seen...most are around 20""  Crappie are ""there""...just not all that plentiful or large"
