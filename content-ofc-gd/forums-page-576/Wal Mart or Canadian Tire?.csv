I don't shop at either one very often, as I choose to support smaller, locally owned shops. But, I do occasionally buy from these stores. In fact I just bought some clackin' cranks at Canadian Tire a few days ago. The only thing I really ever buy at wal-mart is swivels, and maybe a few other pieces of terminal tackle."
550431,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-11 20:29:00,3761,Was just at Canadian Tire and they didn't even have white tubes....what the heck!!
550443,GoneFishin,2011-02-11 20:49:00,349,Canadian Tire is my back up store for sure. Walmart doesn't carry much but they always seem to have goodies on discount P.S. At the end of ice and soft water seasons lots of things go on a miscellaneous discount rack for 3 bucks I came out of there last fall at the end of soft water with about a dozen plastics and swim baits and well just random stuff that was usually 7 bucks or more:clapping:    I'm going to grab some tubes tonight just let me know what size your after.
550499,manitoubass2,2011-02-11 22:41:00,11391,"If you look closely at wal mart, youll find some hilarious baits. Some of the laser lures etc I've seen there look like they come out of one of those 25 cent gum dispensers"

550598,ranksda58,2011-02-12 03:14:00,69,"like many others have said, walmart for the price, canadian tire for the selection"
550635,Afraz,2011-02-12 07:26:00,250,Canadian Tire For Selection..  Walmart for Price (but they seldom have any fishing stuff - well not in my area anyway)
550769,Oggie,2011-02-12 18:16:00,588,I find Walmart really disappointing. My impression before they arrived (in Canada) was that Walmart would have a great selection of tackle (maybe in the US). Canadian Tire is too expensive and even their selection varies depending on store location.  I tend to go to my local tackle shop or Bass Pro. Dan O.
551050,Stern Rules,2011-02-13 12:54:00,342,I second that.

546787,Jonny,2011-02-02 05:52:00,1380,"So I guess the lesson from this thread is for Canadian Tire to stock stuff that Walmart doesn't stock. Then they can charge more than Walmart would on those items, but maybe a little less than small independents.  Of course if you want personal service from someone who knows the stock they're selling, you generally won't get it from either of the big stores."
546801,lakerguy,2011-02-02 12:04:00,224,I will only buy at CT when they have there end of season 50 percent off and I see something I need/want.  My local tackle store gets my money 90 percent of the time.
546846,Fish Farmer,2011-02-02 14:09:00,2234,"Canadian Tire,or my local tackle Shop. Not many Canadian places left. Why support the other. The only thing with Canadian tire is they should have a guy in there fishing department that knows about fishing and what people want in the area. Some stuff I see on there shelves, I just scratch my head."
546850,Harrison,2011-02-02 14:16:00,2202,"Niether.. I support the local shops or buy online.  However, CTC does carry more terminal tackle, so in a real bind, it would be CTC."
546875,Shaun Rickard,2011-02-02 15:04:00,144," Just to clarify Pikeslayer, there is nothing underhanded going here I assure you. We were having a discussion here in the office, and the general consensus was that out of the 2 big box stores CT has a far better selection, but not necessarily the better price, pretty much along the lines of what many have stated here. We simply were curious and wanted to get an outside opinion from others accross the Province. I live in Pickering and we have a CT and Wal Mart here, however as you know some of the rural stores are very different, and offer much more selection than the urban locations. If you're not comfortable posting maybe just skip past the thread.  Thanka again to all who posted!  Cheers, Shaun"

Having said that, I was at walmart yesterday and was snooping through some opened boxes of new stock and they had 3 new suffix lines including a fuse, some nice square billed rapala cranks and some cool new spoons.  They had 3 packs of big Os for $15 and 3 packs of Walleye divers for $15 as well.  I used to work at the old CTC in barrie on Bayfied st when it was 2 levels.  The upstairs had a pretty big and well stocked fishing and hunting section.  We used to sell loads of guns as well, but that 24 years ago."

547742,mistaredone,2011-02-04 17:26:00,913,Canadian tire has my vote.  Wish they all were like the one in Lindsay.
547967,outllaw,2011-02-05 13:48:00,1232,neither store. chinese crap. i support independent stores for selection. they carry regional quality products.
547968,scugpg,2011-02-05 13:54:00,1373,In a pinch I'd say CT has a much better selection.  Walmart is cheaper but I refuse to shop there.
547979,misfish,2011-02-05 14:30:00,29133," Ya that store rocked back then Chris.Great selection.  As for the  Not sure what your store has,but the one here carries alot of brand name lurers,plastics and rods and reels. Their icefishing selection (lures) isnt the greatest,but I wouldnt call HT or Ugly stick ice rods and reels low quality."
548007,Cookslav,2011-02-05 17:02:00,1457,"Canadian tire has a MUCH better selection in my area...as in 10x the selection. But what little Walmart does carry is generally 10% cheaper or more. The same goes for camping supplies, but hunting equipment is not only cheaper but its more plentifull at Walmart....go figure?"
550426,Shaun Rickard,2011-02-11 20:17:00,144," I think all stores carry products made in China outlaw, in fact many of the lures, rods and reels etc. you purchase from the big names such as Berkley, Shimano and Rapala are manufactured in China. Sign of the times, you can't really get away from it wherever you shop.... just my 2 cents"
546494,Grimace,2011-02-01 21:54:00,2020,"  Ah.  I get it.  I was just curious.  I like to know these things.  I hate to feel like a fool when I find out that I have been in a coversation where the other participant had motivation that I was unaware of.  I like things on the up and up.  This is a minor infraction, no biggy.  And besides, I love CTC.  I roam around the place for hours."
546499,GBW,2011-02-01 21:58:00,8460,I have to vote Can. Tire too but MAN-O-MAN they need to do something on price.  Walmart get's my cash before CTC does if they both have the item I'm looking for. Rather go to Gagnon's and get what I need at a better price then my local CTC's...
546501,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-01 22:06:00,0,"In ontario I find Canadian Tire has the best selection/quality but if I cross the border into Sault, Michigan they have a pretty decent outdoors section."

546513,Jonny,2011-02-01 22:25:00,1380,"Used to be that Canadian Tire was a ""Walmart"" of its day, back say in the 60's and 70's.  Now they're more like SEARS, you only get a decent buy (price-wise) when things are on sale.  The CTC in North Bay out-does the Walmart in selection, but not in price, I've found."
546517,Big Cliff,2011-02-01 22:32:00,6899,"CTC, we don't have a Walmart here in Lindsay but if we did, I'd compair prices."
546519,Governator,2011-02-01 22:34:00,879,CTC Always has a better selection and usually where I go.  I only check walmart if I've been dragged there by my wife.  No disrespect to anyone here but I can't stand half of walmart's customers.  Then again when I checkout and spend $40 for a handful of lures I start realize I'm a sucker.
546523,Jonny,2011-02-01 22:37:00,1380, What about the other half?  Have you been browsing that site that posts pictures of some of the losers that shop at Walmart? We're not all like that.   
546524,Billy Bob,2011-02-01 22:37:00,5865,Never shopped a CT for fishing goods but I DEFINITELY have more stuff in my garage the Walmart has in their store and when it comes to hunting I have 4X the amount if not more.

Now it is pretty much on the same level as a dollar store. If this 'survey' turns out to have any ties to CTC or a sponsorship, I will be most disappointed and offended. Hope that's not the case, but maybe you should clarify I will apologize in advance if you find this personally offensive. But I will not apologize for the level of service and warranty denials and pricing rip offs that I have been subjected to at Canadian Tire. My 2 cents  Regrds, Pikeslayer  BTW, I pass 3 CT stores + 2 WM on my way to leBarons & Shortwave Marine."
546573,craigdritchie,2011-02-01 23:29:00,1586,Why not support an independent while there are still some left?

546576,GBW,2011-02-01 23:32:00,8460,"the Port Perry CTC store is great for selection.  again, they need to price shop and get in line (all CTC stores) with the other retailers out there. sorry CTC folks that work there and are on here.  maybe they/you can put a bug in an ear or two to smarten up?"
546586,fish_fishburn,2011-02-01 23:48:00,1311,"Here in Pembroke, crappy has the better selection but wally world has the best prices. Walley world has a lot of junk and few things I am interested in. Crappy Tire's prices are an absolute rip off.  For the buying power they have they sure are not passing it on to the customer.  I spend my money at the local bass shops who have what I want, and their prices are at least 25% less than Crappy.  You know your getting screwed by Crappy when the little independent with 500 sq ft of retail space can beat their prices by that much.  And I love them little shops that are stuffed to the roof with good tackle and gear and the owners really appreciate your business."
546588,cram,2011-02-01 23:52:00,1733,"Canadian Tire by far.  It is a little more expensive than Walmart, but to me the difference doesn't compare to the ability to one-stop shop there.  I also disagree with Pigeontroller -- the CTC i shop at has a lot of top tier stuff. Its not Lebaron, but its pretty good."
546589,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-01 23:53:00,10439,"  We did have an independant but it is very hard to support them when they are gouging. I did spend a lot of my hard earned $$$ with them though. They were 100% more expensive than comparable stores south of here. I'm sorry but there's no way I'm spending $1100 for an ice auger just to support the little guy!!!! Especially when I can get one for under $400 elsewhere.  I did buy maps, bait and some tackle there though. For some reason they went out of business.  Just sayin'"

546648,pikehunter,2011-02-02 01:48:00,1659,"Crappy Tire, oh sorry you did say to spell it out. All right then...Canadian Tire.  I believe Walmart gave it a good shot way back in the beginning when they first enered Canada but they started cutting back and back and still further back till they got to the point of only stocking the biggest selling items. Typical big box store, carry just the high volume fast moving crap. You can always tell what they are getting rid of for good, clearout pricing is the hint. I bought a bunch of meps at Wallyworld one fall day dirt cheap years ago , they never brought them back in after that so it now means a trip to Bass Pro or LeBaron's to stock up."
