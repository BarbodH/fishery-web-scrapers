548126,solopaddler,2011-02-06 01:23:00,8605, Dave I'll wager I've fished those waters more than most over the years yourself included.  I don't believe allowing steelhead access to those waters will harm native fisheries in the slightest.  That pretty much ends the argument for me.
548130,canadadude,2011-02-06 01:33:00,769,"Totally agreed, thanks Solo"
548132,wallacio,2011-02-06 01:37:00,475," My comment was not directed at any one person, rather a general observation...it's no surprise that those who support unlimited access are USUALLY only Steelheaders who do not fish the UC as well.   Take it from someone who fishes there on a regular basis in the recent past, you'd be hard pressed to strike up a conversation with anyone who is knee-deep in the water there on any given day who actually supports unlimited migratory fish access there."
548136,solopaddler,2011-02-06 01:45:00,8605," Well you quoted me and included this statement in your reply:  ""It's no surprise that those who support unlimited steelhead access are ones who do not fish the UC on a regular basis...it's easy to brush-off the fishery as trival when one does not utilize it. ""      That's just sad."
548145,aniceguy,2011-02-06 02:03:00,1094,"opps sorry if my prior post lead to some heated dialogue, that wasnt the intent, I wanted to show a glimpse of the issues surrounding the Credit and as I said the only issue to access is social, one group wants it one doesnt. Canada Dude please re read my posts in there it explains why and how this ladder would be managed and the reationale behind it."
548157,canadadude,2011-02-06 02:28:00,769,"thankyou....I  have read your posts and I understand your reational, I may not agree with it, but please understand my concerns aswell, you guys do a great job I will admit!!!!!! but sorry I  like to critisize somtimes, and I still think I,d like to more on this fish ladder hahahha,. I'm a crap disturber dude so anyway, I'll be honest learned alot from the thread and sorry if I infact derailed it badly. I may not agree but I am open to everyone's opinion and this one is a can of worms I and as you people there is alot of opinion on the Credit River, more then I would of thought and acctualy some great points on both sides"
548162,wallacio,2011-02-06 02:51:00,475,"Poor choice of words on my part, again not my intent to single anyone out.  As for it being ""sad"" that the push for unlimited access is generally not supported by those who enjoy the fishery on a regular basis, it GENERALLY comes from a place of genuine concern (though I will admit there are closed-minded individuals in the mix) for what they are passionate about and if that's your definition of ""sad"" well...  Personally I've not seen any conclusive studies that would suggest that the Brown Trout fishery will not be negatively affected (density or fishing quality) any more than I've seen evidence that it will.   I would more than pleased to read actual scientific data (not just opinions) that would indicate the Browns would not be affected (or even better, increase in number, size etc) if migratory fish were allowed unrestricted access.   How could I not, it would be an amazing win-win scenario.  To that end, I've asked John if he'd be so kind as to provide such data.   Until that time those of us who feel passionately about the UC choose to err on the side of caution.    I can only hope that the actual decision makers as the process moves forward are as equally objective."
548166,wallacio,2011-02-06 02:56:00,475, No worries Louis...civil debate on this issue is a good thing!
548208,moemoe,2011-02-06 06:39:00,352,"Between this post and the one on spoonpullers, I am trying to gain information on this subject, I am a lake troller, I wasn't in   98-02 when the stakeholders regarding this, made their laws and decisions, that being said why weren't the lake trollers asked, supposedly there are future meetings regarding this and i will do by damnest to be at those meetings, What I do find odd is there is not one opinion stating, ""please leave steelhead and chinooks out the upper credit"", on this board and spoonpullers, there is a 100% unison from members and posters to open up the river to all species. I do find it to be odd that there is more segrated opinion open to to allow steelhead access to all parts of the river but not chinook, because steelhead are a foreign species but have been a foreign species for longer. It's like the insurance company commercial that when one new kid wants some ice cream, he is told no, but the new kid who is ""new..er"" is asked chocolate or vanilla, and here it is"
548221,justin elia,2011-02-06 13:00:00,151," Ideally, every fish (and I mean all fish, not just steelhead) SHOULD have the ability to use their home river as they choose, whether it be up to Streetsville, Noval, Ingelwood or the Cataract.  We should not have to decide for them, but in the interest of the various stakeholders on the Credit specificaly, we (CRAA) always try to come to a fair compromise when dealing with issues like barrier placement for example.  The fact of the matter is, is that only the groups that represent the UC, dont use the whole system and are only interested in one fish (Brown Trout).  I agree with you Dave on your point, no angler who fishes the UC would want to see unlimited access for all fish.  And in my opinion, its quite an ""elitest"" attitude by those anglers.  It really should be about whats best for the FISH, not whats best for me.  If we all thought that way I think our fisheries would be in much better shape and every group would have more opportunities to catch fish."
548228,wallacio,2011-02-06 13:38:00,475," Really?   It would now seem that CRAA's position (based on opinons expressed by two of your executive members) that they no longer even support a barrier and believe that there should be unlimited Steelhead access to the Cataract.   If this is not the case, please clarify.   I agree with you HOWEVER you and the rest of CRAA make such statements on the huge assumption that opening up access to the entire system to migratories is actually going to be good for the UC Brown Trout population...I (and others) am not convinced it will until I see evidence to the contrary (which I have requested from CRAA and to date have not seen any).   If unrestricted access turns out to be a bad thing for the long established UC fishery then it really won't have been best for the FISH will it?  It will have only benefitted one group's agenda which CRAA is quick to critize other stateholder groups of doing.    With that said, if data exists that shows the the UC Brown population would benefit from unrestricted access by Steelhead and others let me publically state that I'll be the first person to say throw open the gates!  Will there be any upcoming public meetings as things move forward (as I'd certainly like to attend) in order to continue to stay informed?"
551025,john from craa,2011-02-13 05:12:00,39,"Dave, when I have time I will pull some info together for you.  But understand that is way down on my priority list as we have shows, the fishway construction, fish lifts, hatchery work, tree plantings and dozens of funding apps to do, not to mention my family life comes first.  I am also waiting on updated data from a few sources via MNR and that could take some time.  And let me be clear, CRAA is not a steelhead club.  CRAA is a pro fish club, unlike a few other groups active in the river that only work on 1-2 species.  And I understand you are new to the UC.  I am not.  I have fished it since I was a kid and have freinds that have fished it since the 40's.  You may note (if you have looked), that 1/3 of CRAA's exec team are mainly fly anglers and several only fly fish, with one being a past TU board member too.  I think Louis is the only exec that does not fly fish...but he bass fishes so I guess we can let it slide).  And note 1/2 of the clubs exec are also lake anglers (past and present) with boats and riggers.  I know quite a few UC anglers that support wide open access and many UC land owners that also support wide open fish access.  Yes there are some that are totally oppossed and many others that are somewhat oppossed because they have been fed false info based on long standing steriotypes.  To look from the other side, why should non native, exotic brown trout introduced from Europe be given special segregation from another exotic (steelhead or chinook or coho)?  Are they special?  And especially when there is plenty of evidence to suggest the browns hurt the native brook trout.  And by having a dam that blocks migration to protect the non native browns 100% fur sure hurts native fish including brookies, bass, etc, etc that become isolated or blocked from spawning by the dam.  It is important for anglers to attend public meetings, be informed and work with others and MNR.  Too many simply sit on the riverbank letting things pass by and complain after the fact.  And Canadadude - CRAA is very aware of the economic benefits of the fishery - we funded some research and have been involved in several studies and CRAA runs a fish hatchery and we stock steelhead collected from wild parents every spring so I think we are also well aware of the benefit a good stocking plan has...as well as the risks.  The $120,000 we funded for the ladder came from multiple sources with most coming from donations, fund raising and a major grant from a source in the United States.  Tight lines,  John"
551165,Rustic-Fisher,2011-02-13 20:13:00,826,Very well put!  :thumbsup_anim:
547657,aniceguy,2011-02-04 14:19:00,1094,"I and anyone from CRAA is open and willing to talk to other NGO's I have sent that message a dozen times Dave only to get a ""piss off"" right back at some point when does someone realize there is no hope for compromise Its not cramming an agenda and its really not CRAA who is the up front vocal group on unfettered access of all migratory fish to the cataract  This on going vocalism is just shedding light to the true facts, years of political correctness and hoping that the olive branch gets taken I sadly think might be gone, anyhow this is going down a different path if you wiah Dave you can call me any time, maybe you can call TU and Issiac Walton and see if you can broker even a meeting"
547673,wallacio,2011-02-04 15:03:00,475,"Fair enough, I will certainly bring up this issue next time TU comes knocking for renewal of membership."
547680,john from craa,2011-02-04 15:27:00,39,"Talk about a classic de-railing of some truly awesome news.  The issue of species mix is for another thread.  For those who mis-read the opening post Louis made, CRAA hopes to lift steelhead at the new ladder rather than streetsville in spring.  The steelhead will be manually transported to control spawning access as we have done for the past 7 years.  As Justin noted, the drive will be short, rather than 40 minutes from Streetsville and fish that passed Streetsville will be lifted whereas they were missed in past years.  That is awesome news in itself.  Streetsville may be left open for fish to pass on their own in spring.  Come fall both ladders will need to be manually operated to stop Pacific salmon at Streetsville, manually transfer steelhead and pass browns and Atlantics, plus other species past Norval.  The fish are stopped/segregated by the rules created in the Fisheries Mgt Plan.  Since the plan was writted in 1998-2002, a great deal of new information has come to light.  This includes:  1. Chinook salmon are running between 40-70% wild in Lake Ontario based on fin clips.  A decade ago we were told they were all hatchery fish (oops). 2. There is literally 10 times more research looking at species mix (i.e. browns and rainbows) today than a decade ago.  Professional opinions were also not shared with anglers 12 years ago that also suggested resident browns would be fine. 3. Lake Anglers were excluded from the meetings, as well as Ontario Steelheaders and other groups. 4. Reviews of species mix focussed mainly on allopatric relationships (negative interactions) and failed to examine sympatric (positive) interactions.  As scientific knowledge builds the examples of positive interactions substancially outweigh negative interactions.  Without a doubt, any manmade barrier has negative impacts on fish when it blocks a natural system.  This fish ladder serves to correct a wrong from the middle of the 1800's!  What the future holds for lake fish to access the river is still to be detirmined.  New information and research is always changing the outlook.  What we know in 2011 is lightyears ahead of 2001 for the river and species mix.  The value of allowing the dozens of minnow species to migrate freely once again in itself is astonomical.  So is the value to lifting all the wild steelhead (even if it is for transport for now), or that resident browns that have been trapped below this dam will now have free access to spawn successfully for the first time ever.  Or that rare migrating brook trout can for the first time in 160 years reach their spawning grounds again.  Or that Atlantic salmon can also reach spawning grounds cut off for 160 years.  Each and every one of these examples is cause for excitiment for the fishery.  To put the species issue to bed, here are a few points.  Before reading understand the following:  Atlantic salmon, brook trout, bass and white sucker, etc ate all native fish. Brown trout, rainbow trout and Pacific salmon are naturalized NON native fish (but desired) Exotics are Asian carp, ruffe, goby, etc. New evidence also suggests Sea Lamprey were native to Lake Ontario, but this is still up in the air.  There is not a single system in the Great Lakes where a resident population of non native brown trout was displaced by rainbows (not one).  Yet there are many examples were steelhead runs exploded as a result of allowing increased access for rainbows (Grand and Saugeen Rivers are great examples - I have many more).  There are many more rivers where browns and rainbows have co-existed for a century and both maintain strong populations. Lake Superior has many examples of brook trout doing extremely well with trout and pacific salmon all over the place.  Once limits were lowered and hydro flows set the numbers are exploding in many systems according to several local researchers and anglers.  The number one cause of fish decline are humans, not other fish.  Looking at research there are papers covering the entire spectrum.  Some suggest if a steelhead or browns or salmon shows up that brook trout will be lost, others suggest that brook trout are displacing pacifics and browns and steelhead.  Some blame steelhead for preventing Atlantic success, yet other research shows the Atlantics displace rainbows.  In all this there is only one constant.  When dams are built they screw up fish populations.  When they are removed they benefit fish.  Biodiversity and habitat diversity are the keys to success, not species segregation and isolation.  A river with only 1 specie of fish will produce x biomass, with 5 species it may produce 2x biomass and with 20 species it may produce 5x biomass.  Each specie has a niche and as long as you have significant and variable habitat you will have multiple species with more fish than ever.  ASF just spent 24 million dollars buying three dams on the Penobscot River in Maine.  They plan to remove 2 and build a bypass for the third.  That will open up 1,000 miles of river access to Atlanic salmon, stripped bass, and dozens of other species.  Note the extent the US will go to to correct historical mistakes.  They are 30 years ahead of Canada on such remedial works.  John"
547681,solopaddler,2011-02-04 15:42:00,8605, Exactly how do you figure John when migratory fish aren't permitted to use the ladder?? Seriously give your head a shake.  It's undoubtedly great news and no one would ever play down the work you and others are doing at CRAA but the criticism is perfectly valid.
547685,Grimace,2011-02-04 15:54:00,2020,  I do not agree.  I thought he addressed his concerns in a dignified way.  You have 19 posts on this board and I would bet that all of them have to do with your own agenda.  Do not be such a bully.  I do not have a pony in this race as I do not fly fish nor do I float fish.
547823,john from craa,2011-02-04 20:50:00,39,"Mike - if you want to see more species of migratory fish use the ladder than make sure you voice your position at future public meetings as they come up.  Nothing I would love to see more.  But Mike, maybe you did not read my whole post or Justin's.  We are missing 30-50% of the steelhead run that slip over Streetsville and get stuck below Norval and could not spawn successfully.  This new ladder will allow us to lift those fish too.  Not to mention browns, bass and any Atlantic's.  That is all the migratory gamefish present in the section.  Hopefully you make it out for some lifts this spring.  My agenda ought to be crystal clear - try and get anglers involved and educated about the fishery we all enjoy and get more people to volunteer to make it better.  Louis started the thread to update the community about the exciting project regarding volunteers raising money and helping MNR to build a fish ladder that is badly needed on the river.  John"
547941,spinnerdoc,2011-02-05 04:18:00,556," I was at Belfountain provincial park last summer, and saw lots of rainbows there hangin round, asked the park workers by the gate and he talked about them with disdain, telling me how they are aggressive and would displace the native species. It seems like the incidents you mentioned probably wont be the last with attitudes like that."
547949,kerr,2011-02-05 07:25:00,77,"keep those greasy trout away from the east side and boq:) good job guys, and good luck"
548038,timmeh,2011-02-05 19:27:00,609, I have noticed this in a small trib that I fish for brookies in. It's not in the Credit watershed but same deal. Steelie run has grown on the river and now it's getting harder and harder to find nice brookies in this little trib. No problem find steelie smolts though. This is why I'd rather not see steelies reach the upper Credit. While they may not completely displace the resident fishery there it will add competition which will surely have some impact.
548048,canadadude,2011-02-05 20:27:00,769,"I've followed the thread and I still wonder why a fish lader is built to not lift fish. I understand the arguement between the groups but why build a fish lader here, for the 100 Atlantics that may return, 2 million stocked 100 or less return are you freaking insane and now you spend thousands on a fish ladder. Is the MNR insane,the crra is ok but are you insane, 2 million stocked 100-200 returned it's a freaking bust dudes, atlantics ain't going to happen. In fact I'm tired of the arguments over the credit watershead, it's a waste of time. You don't want what could be an incredible fishery, the econmic potential is great, yet a few are there to stop it, the next is the lobby for lower creel limits, which is fine but does absoulutly nothing if you deprive stocks from reproducing.If we want more fish in the fishery we must alow our resource to reproduce if not the fishery will die it's simple."
548050,solopaddler,2011-02-05 20:50:00,8605,"  I'm pretty sure everyone involved with CRAA wants exactly what the rest of us want, a thriving natural run of steelhead.  Unfortunately it seems wading through a quagmire of red tape slows down the process.  At least the new ladder is a step in the right direction. At some point one can only hope migratory rainbows will have access to it.  To me it's beyond stupid, but at least there's hope now."

548060,canadadude,2011-02-05 21:46:00,769,"I think we're on the same page here, it's unfotunate the MNR and the CRAA don't see the economic value of a steelhead fishery, aswell as a SALMON fishery, I know you have fished Steelhead ally on the NY/ PEN side of erie. A fishery created by the fisheries and is the best in the world, the potential for such a fishery is here if not better, lake ontario and the rivers we have from Toronto east could potentially be the best steelhead fishery in the world, unfortunately the MNR and others beleive our fishery should be natural like it was 2000 yrs ago, just a wake up dudes it's 2011 not 2000bc"
548065,solopaddler,2011-02-05 22:19:00,8605," Stocking is definitely not the answer.  The fishery on the south shore is fun, but I'd rather catch 5 or 6 wild fish as opposed to 20 or 30 stockers any day.  At the moment the most exciting development for Ontario steelheaders is the rebirth of the Saugeen, primarily because the fish now have access to miles of nursery waters."
548073,canadadude,2011-02-05 22:55:00,769," Thats sweet but I'm looking towards Superior north shore, there steelhead fishery is growing naturally, the fish arn't as big but there sweet to catch and unlike the idiots in southern ontario they embrace steelhead run and a pacific salmon run.  I do agree the rebirth of the Saugeen run is great and not only the access but the local club(name notknown) stocked a bunch of yearlings and has been doing a incredible job on follow ups. This club could be a model for all Ontario stocking,...but unfortunatly we need 2 million Atlantics for 100 returns, I'd love to get the percentage on Atlantic returns, it's gotta be 0.000000007 returns  hahahah it's sad but funny. I think the ole fat man Cronzy should be taking alittle credit right now hahahahaha, Say what you want the ole boy makes alot of sense, I'd love to here his opinion on the fish ladder to no where. Darryl  would be all over this 10yrs ago,you never miss the good untill it's gone"
548078,timmeh,2011-02-05 23:14:00,609,"It's great to see groups out there fighting to improve our fisheries and I understand many want a steelhead fishery but you need to realize there are some who do not want to see every trib in Ontario managed with steelhead and salmon as the primary, or only, concern. I realize that steelies have a wider appeal than other trout species, but that doesn't mean we should do everything possible to increase their numbers at the potential loss of other fish populations. There are many good steelhead tribs in southern Ontario, but wild resident fisheries like that which exist in the Credit are fewer.  And I do find it really humorous that steelheaders are suggesting those who fly fish are elitists. Maybe some are, but if you want to know another way to meet elitist anglers just take a spinning reel to steelhead river in the fall. I know cause I've done this for 5 years."
548085,solopaddler,2011-02-05 23:38:00,8605," There's no doubt our MNR and the eggheads that run it pander to no one.  They have their own agenda and to heck with the public at large.  I agree, the money spent on Atlantic restoration could have been far better utilized elsewhere."
548086,canadadude,2011-02-05 23:50:00,769,"Again why are you building a fish ladder, why are you putting the effort in, whats the point in building a fish ladder? Trust me there are many fisheries in Ontario that would love $120,OOO why invest in the credit. This is the most bogus deal in our fishery, we invest $120,000 dollars in the credit river for a fish ladder that can't be used. If you don't want the fishery the ladder will provide then why build it, are you all idiots or is your ego so big you can't absorb defeat. This is a complete waste of money brought on by the many Toronto and southern ontario voters, to be honest it is actually a complete waste. Maybe not we save 40km to move fish hahahahaha are you kidding me , BIG DEAL"
548087,solopaddler,2011-02-05 23:50:00,8605," No one wants to see ""every"" trib in Ontario managed for steelhead.  We are however discussing one of the largest (if not the largest?) steelhead trib's on Ontarios north shore.  Furthermore it sits smack dab in the middle of Mississauga, accessable to hundreds of thousands of urbanites.  The intrinsic benefit of a healthy, wild run of steelhead in the Credit far outweighs any possible negative impacts.  There are many examples even here in ON where migratory fish co-exist beautifully with wild natives. The upper reaches of the Ganaraska immediately spring to mind.  That excuse doesn't fly with me.  What's the definition of an eliteist?  In this specific case user groups like Trout Unlimited and Izaac Walton  represent a FRACTION of the populace. They're having a large say in the goings on, and unfortunately are only lobbying to further their own narrow minded agenda. Personally I call that elitist.  (And for what it's worth I'm a fly fisherman)"

This is what our lisence money goes to, so quit complaining your money is safe, a fish ladder that can't lift fish, nohting wrong there......only in Ontario  here's a better idea take your liscence renewel and flush it down the toilet same results"
548110,wallacio,2011-02-06 00:52:00,475,"   The UC stakeholders have definitely gone overboard with their tactics however they are attempting to protect a fishery that is unique to Southern Ontario.  Protecting this interest is no different or ""narrow minded"" than the unlimited access Credit Steelhead lobby.    There are far more healthy and accessible Steelhead rivers in Ontario than there are good resident Brown fisheries...why POTENTIALLY lower the fishing quality on the UC by allowing migratories up that far?   As I've stated previously an electrobarrier well above Norval but below the UC would benefit both groups.  It's no surprise that those who support unlimited steelhead access are ones who do not fish the UC on a regular basis...it's easy to brush-off the fishery as trival when one does not utilize it.   I can assure you that these feelings are not shared on message boards that actually represent the stakeholders that do use it.  I should qualify my statements that I fly fish and I'm also an avid (float-fishing) Steelheader, who actually spends far more time chasing Steel than I do resident Trout.   I simply appreciate both equally."

CRAA has funded over $120,000 in engineering and construction costs through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (from the US), CFWIP, SARS and internal fundraising work. MNR covered additional engineering costs directly from the local budget and managed to find funding for the construction phase too!  The fishway work began on January 10th, 2011 and should be complete by March 31, 2011.  If all goes well, CRAA will be lifting steelhead at Norval for the first time ever. Steelhead will be transferred as usual, as steelhead still do not have open access past Norval.  Brown trout (non native gamefish), Atlantic salmon, brook trout, redside dace, American Eel and all other native species will have wide open access to the whole middle watershed to the Niagara Escarpment!  Anglers and members are reminded that Norval Dam and the fishway sit on a private farm and are strictly private property. Volunteers will be permitted to help at the new ladder when CRAA is operating to lift fish under controlled access. However there is no public access to the fish ladder for any other reason whatsoever.

547187,Richard S.,2011-02-03 02:13:00,75,  There are but none that will hold back migratory's.   Rich.
547209,BillM,2011-02-03 02:44:00,17367,I thought that there was a deal that if this ladder was built an electro barrier(Or something) had to be put in place so these fish wouldn't make it into the UC?
547213,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-03 02:53:00,1107,Good work Louis and John and all the CRAA members gives me hope that I can get things done on my home river
547215,4x4bassin,2011-02-03 02:56:00,1025,I thought this as well !
547302,aniceguy,2011-02-03 14:00:00,1094,"As part of the Credit river Fisheries managment plan, it calls for a barrier for migratory fish which is currently in progress as an environmental assesment co authored by my self and John.  This new ladder will currently not service Rainbow Trout and Pacific Salmon, it might in the future but thats up for much discussion.  Those proponants of the salmon restoration program who say its going to ruin a fishery can hang up the hat because its that very program that was the catalist for this new ladder  The OMNR manages its fisheries under a classification method, Native fish such as Brook trout, red side dace are at top of this list, followed by naturalized fish Brown Trout, Rainbow Trout then the put delay and take fishery of Pacifics then the invasives at the bottom. Brown trout in the upper Credit below the cataract based on a genetics as determined by Ontario's leading fish genetisist are one in the same so now migratory browns are given access to the entire watershed, yet rainbows who have been in the system at the minimum from 1956 ( as per MNR ) are not allowed above Norval other then manual transfers to a feed tributary for no other reason then social.  For every single document there is an opposing one and there is no clear scientific proof one way or the other bottom line is some studies that say native brookies out compete exotic salmonids and some that say that say they can't compete. Papers that say steelhead whipe out brookies or browns, or that chinook whipe all others out, etc, etc. There are papers that say Atlantic's displace steelhead, steelhead displace Atlantics, browns displace brookies, brookies displace browns, and brookies displace chinooks. For every study that found X there is a study that found Y. Reports from the north shore of Superior suggest brookies seem to do very well with all the wild Pacifics and have developed a sympbiotic relationship there is no clear path, what is clear is that groups such as Trout Unlimited and Issiac Walton Fly fishing Club have in some cases publically and in many cases behind the scenes tried every single approach to not allow Migratory fish above Norval, in fact one president publically stated that there should be no migratories allowed into the river at all.  When this FMP was authored and stakeholders were invited there was 1 pro fish Non Governmental Organization ( NGO ) proponant at that table he was dissected from all angles by groups like TU and Issiac Walton and today we see the current managment philosophy on the Credit, again there is no clear scientific proof as to why rainbows should not have full access to the Credit other then a social one argued by the above groups.    There are many who feel that once this managment plan comes for review in 2012 that all migratory fish should be allowed full access right to the cataract, and once we figure out the degree of naurally reproducing chinooks those too should be re classified into the same catagorty as browns and rainbows, and some say have full access to the cataract,two diametrically opposing views, fueled by passsion, and really other then a social reason ( we dont want anything to play with our resident brown fishery)there is no reason to allow this access.  On other rivers where brown trout and rainbows intermix there is a grumble that the browns arent taking a dry, with the fry and smolts in the river I might suggest a steelhead patterned streamer  Of interest CRAA is also attempting to go a genetic analysis of Credit Brook Trout, as those that fish it for them know many are in the 8 inch range and as full adults are stunted from intermixing from stocked and native animals over the years by MNR, we know where there is potentially an un polluted genetic stream of these fish want to see if we can start the process of restoring the vibrant brook trout to the Credit that once existed."
547318,solopaddler,2011-02-03 15:08:00,8605,  What's the benefit then if steelhead and pacific salmon will not utilize the ladder? Am I missing something here?
547332,BillM,2011-02-03 15:40:00,17367,Atlantics.
547342,solopaddler,2011-02-03 16:07:00,8605,Not very impressed as it stands right now.
547346,canadadude,2011-02-03 16:49:00,769,"What a joke,a fish ladder that dosn't move fish, only in Ontario hahahaha.I'm simply amazed,but not surprised this is typical of the OMNR."
547347,solopaddler,2011-02-03 16:54:00,8605,The work being done by Louis and others is commendable and very much appreciated.  Unfortunately it seems wading through a quagmire of red tap tape takes time.  At least this is a positive step and brings hope for the future.
547348,justin elia,2011-02-03 16:58:00,151,"Building the ladder is the first piece to the puzzle and we are now working on implementation and agreeing on a location for the barrier so that Steelhead and other migratories can access a higher reach in the system.  This is a huge step in the right direction and the Credit is becoming a great river with a lot of positive change.  Anyone who fished the Credit frequently this fall would agree that this has been by far the best year in quite some time.  Im not sure many people are aware of the time and politics involved with an endeavour like this but it took 13 years of work to get here.  Another great point is that we won't have to transfer fish as far (previously from Streetsville), and eventually we can sit back and watch the fish do their own thing.  Which is what its all about.  If we give these fish access, they will pay us back many times over.  By lifting at Norval, we will also be able to determine more accurately how many Steelhead and other migratories make it above Streetsville on their own as well.  This is a very good thing for the Credit!  Kudos to John for his persistence."
547371,timmeh,2011-02-03 18:03:00,609,"Sorry guys but I'm still a little confused here, maybe I'm missing something but my interpretation is; they're reconstructing the norval dam to allow some migratories (browns) to pass but others (pacific salmon) will not be able to pass. How exactly is that possible? Or they're putting in a barrier above the dam that will keep rainbows out of the upper Credit, but browns and atlantis presumably will pass? I'm sure there are very good intentions for the project but I don't fully understand exactly what's being done."
547372,solopaddler,2011-02-03 18:10:00,8605,Why is it only now that migratory fish can be lifted and transferred upstream from Norval?  Did the landowner not allow you guys access in the past?  As has been said this is obviously a step in the right direction but it will do nothing to enhance the current run of steelhead.
547478,spinnerdoc,2011-02-04 00:37:00,556,"Deffinitely a step towards the right direction. Hurray for the credit....i'd have to agree last fall was very good.  Let me see if i get this, so no steelhead will be lifted? It may not have the effect on the steelhead run at the moment but the prospect of getting full access would be something to look forward to.Whats a year to wait and see?"
547520,aniceguy,2011-02-04 02:17:00,1094,"Let me preface this by saying the below comments no matter how harsh they seem to be are based on fact and yes it might ruffle some feathers but often said the truth hurts  -The Credit is a confusing river sometimes when looking at it from an end users perspective. Ok so the managment plan was created some time ago here is a link to the entire document www.craa.on.ca its on the front page. its a bit of a long read but very insightful, the parts regarding species partition are of particular interest and tie to this well  the long of the story.  when it was created years ago stakeholders, provided input to the MNR on how the resource should be best managed.  Then as I said earlier there was really 1 NGO that was pro fish (let the migratories up and let it sort its self out to a point because brook trout always should be protected) but there were many others who wanted no pacific fish in the river to even come close geographically or physically to impede thier ability to catch resident brown trout ona  dryfly.  It was surrounded by  some very big elitist style anglers who regardless of any pro fish approach stood strong that in no way was Joe public going to come to the forks and catch rainbows or god forbid a chinook or coho.  In thier minds this would bring an unwanted group ( you know the general public ) to invade thier holy water,and some within these groups lobbied the MNR and others as hard as they could regardless of whats best for fish in general, they wanted to preserve thier special way and method of fishing harsh but there is truth to this.  As part of the David and Goliath story back then the 1 NGO wanting stelhead, chinook, coho and brown access got obliterated by other NGO's and some even say that the MNR was so intimidated it even sided with the ones not wanting the Pacifics and the very same Lake Browns up river, it was simple many ( Goliath ) by shear numbers got what they wanted, no pacifics at all.  Now some concessions were made a potential barrier, experimental transfers etc, and we have what we have today.  Without the supplimental transfers and stocking done by one NGO the rainbow population would be at best 1000 or so, some stocked some strays, we estimate this years run could touple 5 digits all due to the work of select volenteers  A few years back John and I approached the mnr to start to transfer Rainbows to a feeder creek and if you followed its success we each year were transferring more and more fish, this year should again be a record amount also based on what we see, bringing me to the point. We are seeing a huge influx of new rainbows some strays of course but many new fish from these transfers, now imagine, currently they have a few km of a few tributaries that they couldnt reach without mans help aka the CRAA lifts, while neither Norval or Streestville are perfect barriers some do slip by but with full access its 70 or 80 km of habitat they can reach, simply put imagine a few football fields of total access, right now they can only access about to the 10 yrs line of the first one, imagine if they could go the distance So you see thats how the story unfolds Right now Atlantics and any Native species can if it could go anywhere in the system, but any introduced fish cant. Hopefully this explains it better and sorry if I ruffled a few feathers"
547541,BillM,2011-02-04 02:59:00,17367,"Lou, if I catch a steelhead at Cataract Falls, I'm going to leave it on your doorstep  :)"
547547,aniceguy,2011-02-04 03:08:00,1094,-just ring the doorbell Bill so we can crack a few beers
547548,BillM,2011-02-04 03:08:00,17367,LOL!!!  Deal
547572,wallacio,2011-02-04 03:45:00,475," The hard work over the years from CRAA is definitely commendable and I can understand the frustration when other stakeholder groups have attempted to block efforts with heavy-handed measures.   With that said, wouldn't it be more prudent to drop the rhetoric ie ""elitists vs the general public"" and attempt to work within a compromise that will see an increase in Steelhead numbers which does not potentially jeapordize the already established Brown Trout fishery above Inglewood ie accept the use of an electrobarrier rather than continuing to lobby for unrestricted access of all migratory fish right to the Cataract?  Before the usual responses of ""Steelhead and Browns can and do co-exist in other systems"" start popping up, let me say that I know that they do however it's already been stated by the CRAA executive that results of studies on multi-Salmonid species competition is far from conclusive.  No one can definitively state that the Brown Trout population of the UC wouldn't suffer if Steelhead were allowed to spawn there any more than they can say there would be no effect.  The Upper Credit Brown Trout fishery is unique to Southern Ontario - a relatively large system which comfortably allows one to fly-fish, it contains good numbers of wild fish (many of them large) and with a great deal of public access.   This fishery is enjoyed not by just a handful of ""elitists"" but by a large cross section of anglers on a daily basis.   I know this because I fish there on a regular basis and it's not just the ""Orvis Crowd"" up there.  In fact, they are the minority as most of them are on the Grand where it's easier pickings.  You are more likely to find young guys who are passionate about fly fishing, casual anglers throwing a spinner as well as grizzled ""Trout Bums"" who live out of campers on the backs of their beat-up pick-ups.    IMO this is reason enough to leave it the way it is ie by not taking the risk of changing the population dynamincs by allowing migratory Rainbows to gain access as far as the Cataract.   Again, from where I sit the electrobarrier below Inglewood would be the ideal compromise - Steelhead would still have access to the tributaries that they are lifted into at the present time as well as the main stem below Inglewood thus increasing their numbers while at the same time not altering the UC Brown Trout fishery that so many of us enjoy as-is."
547635,aniceguy,2011-02-04 13:29:00,1094," When I said ruffle feathers I immediately thought of you as I know your passion for those upper Credit fish. AS I said from the initial post this is a social issue and has nothing to do with the science behind it, it has been a 12 year plus effort to compromise, a few years back I approached a senior member of TU and asked if we can have a dialogue on this very matter, maybe I thought that even though we act as advisors to the MNR a unified front on a location of some sort of barrier would solve this issue once and for all.  The answer I recieved was short of graphic but none the  less it summed up to not in a milion years.  In answer to comprimise, how can there be one when a few stakeholders when given the opportunity to provide input as to a location, dont but in fact say that there should be no barrier, craa transfers shouldnt be allowed and stocking level should be dropped or eliminated all together, please answer that Dave, where is the comprimise there.  As to the Upper Credit while there is some uniqueness its far from being a stand alone fishery and I think we both can provide several rivers where the Brown fishing is even better, and yes it is an elitists attitude when one wants to protect one fish and a way of fishing for it, over other fish and multiple methods, its about Pro fish, alot of guys want that no kill removed and allow for fish retention, imagine how that would impact things We all know have seen and heard of guys up there intimidating someone who isnt fishing a 4wt, this summer I personally know soemone who went up and fished single plastic eggs, a pink worm and such with float gear, only to have a dent in his car, and 3 very regular guys from there pretty much slide next to him and rip him a new one for his technique, thier comments were "" you dont belong here"" go to erindale. My parents neighbor a 78 yr old who fished the upper in the 50's took his grandson, they parked at the grange slide down and fished, the boy had a bobber, and a berkley power bait egg sac, off the bridge a few guys ended up tossing rocks in the pool and threatened to call the police due to his angling tactics, of which to old man knew were within his rights, yet another example of the goings on that occur up there, while there are some great guys who fish up there, an equal amount of elitists exist who have said right to my face they would kill and drop in the bush any steelhead parr smolt or mature fish they saw, imagine how I felt hearing that... The best streches of the upper are dominated by 3 or 4 property owners, of which one is so enraged over garbage that thier access might dissapear this year potenitally complete with private security guards enforcing this No access.  A decade ago there might have been comprimise, if groupls like TU and Issiac Walton were willing to even talk, these days growing numbers of anglers lake wise and stream wise are more educated and want more fish and with Ontario's biodiversity and sustaniability stratagy the Credit should be wide open allowing all migratory fish to utilize its avaliable habitat the time for status quo is gone, again if brown trout are managed and classified the same as rainbows and we know genetically the browns in the upper and lake are one in the same, lake run browns are allowed there now, why cant rainbows, when someone can answer that Im all ears until then I stand true that its time for a change  Of interest in a recent economic valuation of the credit steelhead out ranked in orders of magnitude all other fish, additional access for steelhead provide additional economic opportunities. Something else to ponder in all my years of lifting fish from Streetsville and with all the open invitations to Trout Unlimited and Issiac Walton I have yet to see any member of thier board or executive come to help with transfers< I wonder why"
547649,wallacio,2011-02-04 14:05:00,475,CRAA's ongoing vocal criticism of TU and the Issac Walton club is ironic as it seems the same confrontational and uncompromising approach with ramming one's agenda through has now been adopted.   I submit that compromise is still the best approach for both sides.
