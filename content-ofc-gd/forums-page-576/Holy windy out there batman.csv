550960,bigugli,2011-02-13 02:01:00,6138,RobD and I put in 4 hours this morning. One of us had to remain sitting in the hut at all times or it would have been airborne.
550977,RickOnt,2011-02-13 02:22:00,669,A Whole Lot Nasty out there For Sure!!!!  Terry Some Great Video!!!  It Explains what I am seeing on the H-Bird!!!  Thanks Rick
551004,Skud,2011-02-13 03:40:00,739,You guys are nuts for being out there!
550815,Joey,2011-02-12 20:50:00,9122,"Another interesting outting on Simcoe today.  I know they called for 35 kph winds, but man, it was brutal.  We all thought we were gonna lose our huts down the ice.  I can't believe they didn't flip over  Anyhoooo, Terry brought up the first, a nice whitey    I brought up the second, a nice laker    You'll notice the pics were taken from inside huts.  It was catch one, run to the next hut for a pic, then back to your own hut     Some people did fish without a hut out there tho, I was quite surprised to see that!!!  Then came trouble.  Poor Lloyd's sled decided it was time to quit.  Ron towed him over, then ran him back to his truck at Jackson's Point, then came back.  Lloyd had to drive around and meet the guys at BBP.  Paul towed it to there, following Ron, taking Keith along for the ride.  Sorry about your ride Lloyd, but I'm sure you'll have her fixed up in no time.  Ron hitchhiking    Booger check     No Ron, you're all clear      No, its not too windy    Getting ready to tow the sled back to shore    And they're off!!!    Called it a day early today.  Just too windy and the fish seemed to stop biting after the first two.  Great to see you again Ron, its been too long.  Nice seeing you again Terry, Lloyd and Keith.  See you soon  Joey"
550817,Gregoire,2011-02-12 20:52:00,1397,Thanks for sharing. Even though the conditions looked harsh I need to stop posting and get off my arse some time soon.
550821,misfish,2011-02-12 20:59:00,29133,"I swear that at 4:30 this morning,it was great outside. Glad ya got the sled back safe and sound. My god,did Terry catch another fish.Mans on a roll. Good on ya bud."
550822,irishfield,2011-02-12 21:05:00,26272,  Glad I stayed in bed !!! (not that my back was letting me have it any other way anyhow..)
550825,vinnimon,2011-02-12 21:14:00,2593,"WOW, BRRRRR, you guys are troopers! Nice fishies guys.    "
550836,Joey,2011-02-12 21:33:00,9122,"Thanks guys, ya, it was a tad nippy, but I'm still glad I went.  Trout for dinner  FYI, here is the stomach contents, be advised, kinda gory         "
550843,lew,2011-02-12 21:55:00,12766,Definetely appears to be a tad breezy out there Joey but from the looks of those couple of fish it was worth it....Good stuff for sure !!
550856,johnnyb,2011-02-12 22:32:00,3413,"Being on foot, I'm glad I stayed off Simcoe this morning.  Got set up a little further north before the wind got stupid....man was that insane.  Really nice laker, Joey....and Terry that whitefish is makin me hungry!  I'm stunned that Lloyd got outfished....by TERRY!    Hope you get your sled fixed soon Lloyd...."
550861,Terry,2011-02-12 22:36:00,14456,"it was an interesting day for sure hope Lloyd has an easy time getting his sled fixed  I have lots of video of whitefish swimming around ignoring my bait  here is a taste  <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""640"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/i3-Ktrzk8lU"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
550862,irishfield,2011-02-12 22:39:00,26272,Some good size fish.. why I always have one line at 5 or 10 feet off bottom.
550863,Leecher,2011-02-12 22:45:00,7832," Yowzer Joey.... that laker ate pretty well    No kidding about the wind today, I was out this morning until about noon.... fish had turned off then.... made it back home and it's still windy  Great report and pics Thanks for sharing Leechman"
550872,Joey,2011-02-12 22:58:00,9122,"Great video Terry.   You were right, lots of them swimming around.  They were just ignoring my bait  Definately not on bottom either."
550873,walleyejack,2011-02-12 23:00:00,358," kewl video, was out there also,and was a little breezy,kept the flies away tho. came away with 0 for 1 tomorrow is another day"
550875,EC1,2011-02-12 23:02:00,930,"Nice. I guess I should be glad I didn't go today, but I am itching big time! Joey, how bad would you say the walking conditions are as of today?"
550879,Joey,2011-02-12 23:14:00,9122,"EC1, lots of people walked, but it was a hard go with drifts and slush spots.  One of our buckets blew down the ice and I went after it, hard to walk in both the drifts and the slush, and I got two wet boots for it.  Good thing I had good, waterproof boots on.  Try where there are good snowmobile trails that are packed down.  Joey"
550886,EC1,2011-02-12 23:34:00,930,"Great, Thanks for the info Joey!"
550889,BUSTER,2011-02-12 23:38:00,1336,Love the video footage
550891,DRIFTER_016,2011-02-12 23:43:00,10439,  Nice!!! You got bait for next time.
550895,12footspringbok,2011-02-12 23:57:00,459,"Good on ya for fishing through the crap today. Crappy about loyds sled. I fired mine up to head back to shore today and it didn't sound right. Under the hood was completely rammed with snow from all the wind.   I cleaned alot of it out and said to my buddy if i don't ice up a carb on the way back it'll be a miracle, but we made it back...."
550896,GoneFishin,2011-02-13 00:05:00,349," It was great, right until about 8am after we got the hut set up and lines in... I went out to Simcoe for the first time today with a couple of buddies and my gf, and we ended up in side the hut all morning holding the walls from collapsing or breaking.. Does the weather always get that bad out there? You would have though they might have a wind advisory or something warning people not to go out Oh well, hopefully we get another chance to go before ice out. I want my first ""lake"" trout lol."
550897,Handlebarz,2011-02-13 00:06:00,3790,Dang I hate these posts it sure does make me wish I lived alot closer so I could get out for some of these trips I get the invites but the 5 hours each way to fish the day is a little much when its not musky fishing
550899,irishfield,2011-02-13 00:09:00,26272,Gonefishin.. it was no secret.. the weather forecast has been showing 35K winds for today since at least mid week. With all that warm air coming for tomorrow gusts on top of the forecast winds are a given.
550900,Terry,2011-02-13 00:14:00,14456,yeah Wayne told us yesterday the wind was going to be 35+ today..and it was guess you didn't get the memo...LOL
550917,asdve23rveavwa,2011-02-13 00:44:00,2690,"Wow, I think Juli and I made the right call not joining you all today.  Walking out in that would have been brutal!!  Good luck to Lloyd with the sled!!"
550926,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-13 00:58:00,3761,"Nice report Joey, was on Simcoe today with GF, wind was brutal...nothing to show for out efforts sadly"
