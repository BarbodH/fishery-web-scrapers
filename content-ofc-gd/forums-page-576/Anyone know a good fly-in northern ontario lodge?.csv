Would be going for a week in july or august sometime.  Anyone had any good personal experiences?  Just at the research stage.....looking at webpages and hopefully making it to the fishing show and checkin out some booths.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thx"

Eddie's camp on that Attawapiskat River ""might"" though, especially if it's trophy pike you're after. It's the hottest trophy pike fishery going at least in Ontario.  http://eddienorth.com/   Unless you're willing to travel to northwestern Ontario it may be difficult to find a fly in lodge with Bass as well as pike and walleye.  If you get a bit more specific regarding your budget, what amenities you want, and how far you're willing to drive to the jump off point I can offer you many more possibilities."
