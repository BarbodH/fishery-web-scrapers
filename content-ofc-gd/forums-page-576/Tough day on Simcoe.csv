The fishing was tough, but he got his laker and he lost a giant too at the end of the day... it has fueled his fire!! Moved a bunch to stay on fish today, walk wasnt too bad with the cold weather.  Gonna get sloppy quick though!!     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPWlCrnQD4M"
550538,jaydub,2011-02-12 00:03:00,145,"Too bad for your buddy Kyle,   that was gonna be a pretty sweet fish by the looks of it!  At least he got a few"
550542,irishfield,2011-02-12 00:10:00,26272,Some nice fish Steve.. but tell Kyle that is what happens when you reel when they're pullin line!!
550544,steverowbotham,2011-02-12 00:15:00,1800," It's all new to him, hes loving it though and it will come in time when the excitement can be controlled easier... haha"

550615,Joey,2011-02-12 03:56:00,9122,"Great video, you both got some nice fish.  Too bad he lost the monster, but it will still be there for another day"
550616,hi09,2011-02-12 04:00:00,46,im heading up in the a.m looks like u boys had a solid day!
550668,steverowbotham,2011-02-12 15:05:00,1800," There's a lot of things that could have been done differently, but as I said its all new to him and hooking a big fish for that is really exciting for anyone, and things you just learn go out the window sometimes in that situation.  Unfortunately he lost the fish, but he's been informed of how he can better increase his chances next time, he was happy enough to just experience the fight."
