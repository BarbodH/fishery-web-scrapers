550351,Rod Caster,2011-02-11 14:51:00,5784,Follow the main snowmobile trails and you'll be ok. I wouldn't venture into any unbroken areas in the channels...we had our shack in that area a few years ago. 2 feet of ice directly underneath us and less than a foot of ice just 50 meters away.
551232,Mike01,2011-02-14 00:31:00,378,"agreed, stay close to the snowmobile trail.  just be careful, as there are some small islands that may be covered in snow.  There is over 2.5ft of ice on most of the lake."
