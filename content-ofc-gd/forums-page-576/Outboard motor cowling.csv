Thanks."

They denied cracking it, but eventually I got them to admit to it and do the repair.  I believe they used epoxy and fiberglass.  It's not perfect or nice to look at, but it set well and does the trick.  If you decide to go this route, you will want to let it cure for awhile and probably will want to do most of the work on the inside of the cowling so that it is not too unsightly."

Used it to fix a cracked kayak. Layer on glue, stick on fiberglass tape, then 'soak' tape in glue, using a piece of plastic to squeeze glue into tape. A couple of layers gives a nice solid repair when cured."
