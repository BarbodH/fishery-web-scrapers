I was wondering if anyone give me a rough idea of what insurance would be on such a machine.  I'm in my late 30's, clean driving record and have also been an owner of a insured street bike for 8 years (if that would be a factor or not, I'm not sure).  Thanks!"

550921,danbouck,2011-02-13 00:51:00,4380,Call Nathan Ackland from State Farm in Brantford. He drives atv's and can get great prices. Google his name for the number.
