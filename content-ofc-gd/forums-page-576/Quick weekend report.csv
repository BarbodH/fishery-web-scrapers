After an hour someone flipped a switch and everything stopped. Smelt would not come off the bottom. With a lot of teasing we could get a few to rise every 1/2 hour or so, but it was a lot of work to get 4 dozen smelts. Always happy to see young Jordan. A smiling ball of energy. Emil, the smoked fish and sausage were excellent.  On to this morning.  RobD and myself set up in a local marina. hoping for perch or trouts. Caught the tail end of a morning bite, and had enough for a meal. Water was gin clear, and we could see a few oversized perch down the hole, but they weren't biting. Around 11 the bit turned off. Nothing to be seen anywhere, other than a big pike. Kind of explains why the perch disappeared. Nothing wrong with a perch dinner."

Smelts were not as numerous as last year but there could only be one reason for it - someone (read Steve) has caught them all last weekend) ha ha ha Oh well it was a nice day together. Looking forward to see you aboard my salmon fishing machine in the summer.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
