550562,GoneFishin,2011-02-12 01:01:00,349,Just got back from Walmart in Oshawa (north end) and they have fishing items on clearance. Including lindy darters!!!(only 2 left where I was) If you want to save your self 6 bucks I'd go before they are all sold out! Also have gulp alive maggots and fish fry mini containers for 5 bucks!
