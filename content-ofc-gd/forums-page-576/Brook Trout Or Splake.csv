549856,johnnyb,2011-02-10 15:39:00,3413,"I rarely read all the posts in discussions like these....but this one has been good.  My first thought was that the tail wasn't perfectly square, but I didn't think that would make a difference, and figured brookie right off the bat.  I guess the only thing to do with specks/splake is to keep your limit so you can mail their stomachs to Dr. Salvelinus for proper id  ,  and not take pics of the ones you release!"

550385,Leecher,2011-02-11 17:12:00,7832,It's a brookie just like this one    Leechman

548936,flyfisherkirk,2011-02-08 02:48:00,23,"It's definitely a Brook Trout. Splake have laker tails,(forked) and Brookies have square tails"
548939,toca,2011-02-08 02:54:00,274, Yeah I Asked If It Was A Speckled. But Somebody I Talked To Mention It Could Be A Splake. So I Thought I Confirm It Once And For All.
548949,speckchaser,2011-02-08 03:12:00,17,"After looking at all the pictures and some of my own I am sure that it isn't a brookie, and it sure ain't a laker so that only leaves a splake. The post about the tail is correct. It isn't square and it isn't fully forked like a laker so another vote for the splake. Soooooooo theres my 2 cents.... I think its a splake."
548950,Dara,2011-02-08 03:17:00,3052,"The only legal answer is, if it was caught in a lake stocked with Splake, then its a splake. If it was caught in a spec lake or anywhere else then its a spec. Splake are open year round and you are not expected to determine if it is a splake, spec or lake trout. If the lake is stocked with splake, its legal as a splake"
548953,flyfisherkirk,2011-02-08 03:22:00,23,absolutely a Brookie!
548987,camillj,2011-02-08 05:00:00,1988,Definitely used to be some Brookies in Rice .. once upon a time
549006,Spiel,2011-02-08 12:13:00,9065,Brook Trout !
549026,Jer,2011-02-08 14:09:00,1426,"Just by location, I'd hafta say it's a brookie. I can't imagine anywhere near Rice that would be stocked with splake."

549055,fishhunter,2011-02-08 15:38:00,604,I'M WITH YOU
549058,Sinker,2011-02-08 15:54:00,8692,100% pure wild brookie. You guys who think otherwise need to do some research.  Specks will venture into rice if the water temps are right. A lot of rice lake tripbs are loaded with specks  S.
549064,solopaddler,2011-02-08 16:07:00,8605," Agreed. If you'd have said Rice right off the bat there would've been no doubt.  Some of the creeks feeding Rice have brookies. There's certainly no splake.  As far as the mis-identification goes, the tail is slightly forked in the pic.  If you guys are curious google some images of splake. As mentioned depending on the strain they look pretty much exactly like spec's except for the tail."
549069,misfish,2011-02-08 16:23:00,29133," You mis lead me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, So are those rainbows you catch,or are they pike?   Now I have to buy me brudder a case of beer."
549074,solopaddler,2011-02-08 16:45:00,8605,  I still wouldn't bet the life of my children that it's a brook trout.   (I'll gladly buy the beer)
549080,jedimaster,2011-02-08 17:16:00,3472,"Definatly a speck. The square tail doesn't mean perfectly square. A Spec side by side to a splake is easily distinguishable. I have only been on one lake with both Spec's and Splake's. Plus to tell the tail, you ned to lay to fish on its side and spread the tail out completly. If the tailfin is pressed in it will fork a bit like in the picture. But if you had of spread it out you woul dsee it squares up a bit."
549085,Dara,2011-02-08 17:44:00,3052,"Ok, what are these.    2 of them have perfectly square tails."
549093,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-08 18:21:00,0,"anyone who claims to be able to tell by looks alone are full of beans... at least according to the flat belly scientist types.  they think they can tell because they've fished lakes with splake... therefore, they knew WHEN they caught them that they were splake.  i looked at specimens in college that were in fact splake, but looked in every way similar to a brook trout, including the square tail.  as i mentioned above, the only way to know is to count the pyloric caeca, and if you can do that looking at a picture you're real good!   but, it sure is funny how definite some of you are!"
549095,Dara,2011-02-08 18:28:00,3052,"[quote name=  but, it sure is funny how definite some of you are!     Thats why I posted the picture of the square tailed splake...I think"
549098,Roy,2011-02-08 18:37:00,13728," Doc, I'm not counting anything's caeca, I don't care who you are.  And BTW, it's a brookie."
549107,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-02-08 19:15:00,0,"i think it's been established that it's a brookie, but that's only because the location of where it was caught was revealed.  if that fish had no waterbody associated with it, there is not a person on this page who could tell definitively by a single picture like that (even though many of you clearly think you can)..."
549109,solopaddler,2011-02-08 19:17:00,8605,"  Agreed.  My first answer was a guess, nothing more."
549118,fishrking,2011-02-08 20:09:00,24,"I like how people jump on bandwagons without thinking for themselves - the pic is obviously a brook trout - that said, there are times when splake can have slightly squared tails and brook trout when they are jeuvies can have slight forks int them."
549119,jedimaster,2011-02-08 20:13:00,3472,"Have you ever seen a Speckled trout with a deeply forked tail? Me neither. If it has a forked tail and its in a lake stocked with splake, chances are very good its a Splake.  If its in a lake that has not been stocked with splake, and the tail is squarish its more than likely a speckle trout.   If you are on a lake with both speckled trout and splake then you are in for a fit, and you will have to take your best guess."

549127,toca,2011-02-08 20:55:00,274, Would Be Nice.
548824,toca,2011-02-07 23:44:00,274,Was Talking To A Fellow Angler And I Got Into A Conversation Of Brook Trout Fishing. Ended Up Showing This Picture And That Person Was 99 percent sure it was a splake. I Remember Showing This Picture Before And Someone Else Told Me It Was A Brook Trout.  So Ive Decided To Settle This Once And For All  
548828,Roy,2011-02-07 23:50:00,13728,Brookie
548831,misfish,2011-02-07 23:55:00,29133,"If I said atlantic,would I be out of line?  Me brudder has it right."

548837,BillM,2011-02-07 23:59:00,17367,Definitely Salvelinus fontinalis.
548839,shadowfly,2011-02-08 00:00:00,84,That's called the perfect meal for One.
548840,solopaddler,2011-02-08 00:01:00,8605,It would help to know where it was caught.  Some splake look remarkably similar to brook trout.  If put on the spot I'd say splake because the tail doesn't look entirely square.
548849,Old Man,2011-02-08 00:17:00,822, Exactly my thought. The tails too forked for a Brookie and probably not enough for a Laker.    
548850,misfish,2011-02-08 00:18:00,29133,  At that size/age do they show the square tail Mike? Just asking.
548853,solopaddler,2011-02-08 00:23:00,8605,  They sure do.
548855,Roy,2011-02-08 00:27:00,13728,Wow...
548856,Rod Caster,2011-02-08 00:28:00,5784,Good photos OldMan! The mouth curves down quite a bit...I'll say it's a splake.
548857,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-08 00:28:00,4399,I am with Mike on this one Splake!
548858,Roy,2011-02-08 00:31:00,13728,It's a BROOKIE! You guys are starting to worry me.
548859,solopaddler,2011-02-08 00:33:00,8605," The tail is a bit of a giveaway Roy.  I have pic's in my scrapbook of splake and unless I told you, you'd swear they were brookies."
548860,lookinforwalleye,2011-02-08 00:35:00,4399,Splake I caught one 30 years ago and that makes me a Splake expert!!! But I stand to be corrected!!!
548863,skeeter,2011-02-08 00:44:00,1907,I think it's a speckled trout that got splaked in the oven!  but speckchaser will be on shortly to settle the debate.
548864,misfish,2011-02-08 00:49:00,29133," Sry brudder,yer on yer own from here.  I say splake.LOL  Thanks Mike."
548867,trevy727,2011-02-08 00:53:00,351,"I think if you layed that fish down on a table, the tail would be square making it a brookie. It definately has a slight fork the way its hanging but I think it's misleading."
548868,toca,2011-02-08 00:58:00,274,"I Caught This Fish At Rice Lake. It Was Approximately 10"" And Was Release Immediately Because It Was Out Of Season. Took My Quick Picture And Put It Back."
548875,irishfield,2011-02-08 01:08:00,26272,I can guarantee these are brookies.. and they looks identical.      Mind you reTodd's fishes tail looks a bit shorter and rounder on the outside edges.

548919,ehg,2011-02-08 02:14:00,2666,It is a brook trout. I remember the report where you caught a fallfish as well there. Both uncommon catches in Rice Lake but it was early in the season when the water was still cold. Have caught quite a few specks in tribs of the Otonabee River. Early in the cold water season they could slip into main lake.
