407199,skinny,2009-12-01 02:39:00,442,i found good deal on a 14ft alum 1975 mirrocraft /2 seats / deep hull(no leaks) /steering wheel with 40 hp on back it'a about an hour away from me and the guy has no camera I'm not sure if this is the style I have been looking for because I don't know that much about mirrocraft. I have looked a bit but not sure I'm looking at the right stuff on the net i would like to know I'm going to look at what I want instead of wasting time and links or help would be great
407298,Uncle Buck,2009-12-01 14:01:00,1000,it's an hour away... make the drive... i've driven further for less
407302,[emailÂ protected],2009-12-01 14:13:00,290,Hey if you buy a new boat you should sell my your old one.. lol
407307,Greencoachdog,2009-12-01 14:20:00,8163,"I'd be more concerned about what make and model the motor is to start with, if it's a Chrysler... forget about it!  The no pic thing would also be a red flag to me."
407436,skinny,2009-12-01 19:42:00,442,well looked at it it's a 40 merc says it runs it has the nose enclosed and all the steering on the left like norm 2 seats side by side and a floor/deck behind the seats i forgot my phone so no pics says he has paper work for it but it's not there  the 40hp is a bit much for the area i fish in but I also do want to go out on lake erie   what to do what to do the boat is a steal of a deal I think oh no trailer so I would have to figure out the move part too
407445,Uncle Buck,2009-12-01 20:04:00,1000,"He says it runs, don't mean crap...  lots of motors ""ran the last time out""  power is never enough..."
407447,Fish4Eyes,2009-12-01 20:11:00,1022,"When you go back, bring a set of muffs and see if it runs. If he refuses walk away. If it runs rough, don't believe him if he says ""it just needs a tune up"" like I was told."
407452,Greencoachdog,2009-12-01 20:18:00,8163,The motor ran great on the very first boat I ever bought!!!... but only in reverse!
407578,mistaredone,2009-12-02 02:25:00,913,"If the price is too good to be true it probably is.  Wet runs should be manditory even when buying a beater.  Not sure how much he's asking but be patient, check kijiji every day and you will find what you want.  Good luck."
407582,T Fisher,2009-12-02 02:44:00,139,"A 1975 yik's thats 35 years old  better start that sucker up with muff's on.  Run until warm run it in gear, frwd and rev.  If it runs but runs rough run for the hills."
