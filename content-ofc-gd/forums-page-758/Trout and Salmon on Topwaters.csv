407482,ped,2009-12-01 21:18:00,16,Does anyone know if trout and salmon strike small stickbaits when in rivers.
407483,[email protected],2009-12-01 21:20:00,290,"  My initial reaction would be no, as they tend to be near the bottom.  However, last week one took a swipe at my float... It has the teeth marks on it to prove it."
407484,ped,2009-12-01 21:24:00,16, sound promising but im still not sure yet
407498,Musky or Specks,2009-12-01 22:27:00,2710,I dont know about topwater but this steelhead came on a rouser-a muskie glide bait that stays near the surface you can see it hanging from its mouth

407531,NAC,2009-12-02 00:14:00,369,"I see Browns pick smelt off near the surface all the time, so it is definitely possible."
407536,MJL,2009-12-02 00:34:00,2427,"Top water steelhead…Hell Yeah!!!  For me it’s my holy grail of fishing.  I’ve been blessed to have caught 1 3-4lb chrome steelhead on a dry fly (my only fish ever caught on a dry fly).  I’ve also fished for them subsurface a foot or two with original rapalas as well as the jointed model in fast current -  Watching them wake behind your lure as you retrieve it in is an insane rush.  Like all things fishing, it’s dependant on weather and seasonal conditions (something I’m still learning myself after 7-8yrs of trying for topwater steelhead).  I give surface fishing a try once or twice a year either with the fly rod or with lures…I don’t have the sheer dedication to pursue it all the time – It’s definitely not a numbers thing but it does happen to those who are persistent."
407539,kemper,2009-12-02 00:46:00,2232, Crazy eh?  I tried skating some surface patterns this spring in the low gin conditions with hungry droppies. I got a couple to follow but I couldnt get them to commit!
407544,ped,2009-12-02 00:58:00,16,"oh god, you guys are getting me excited."
407566,StoneFly,2009-12-02 01:50:00,574,"Ive never done any top water or Dry flyfishing for salmon or steelhead,...but on many occasions,..usually around dusk I have witnessed steelhead and salmon surfacing to eat something on the surface,...its pretty cool to watch."
407567,BillM,2009-12-02 01:50:00,17367, I wouldn't get to excited about top water steelhead
407580,kemper,2009-12-02 02:30:00,2232," Yup, an exercise in futility.  Doesn't stop me from trying when I've had my fill of serious steelheading for the spring. I also got a couple stripping a huge zonker minnow this spring!"
407642,crankbait,2009-12-02 07:14:00,82,I think using a single egg will work better this time of the year.
407646,ChrisK,2009-12-02 12:16:00,2772,This is a good read if you have a few of minutes. http://www.flyfishsteelhead.com/stories/surface.htm
407649,dave524,2009-12-02 12:53:00,4508,"I beleive the late Lee Wulff used to catch Atlantics on dry flies at times and they are not unlike our steelhead. My best bet is that he would have used the Lee Wulff pattterns of dry flies, bushy high riders,  often variations of existing patterns. For those inclined to try for steelies on a dry fly I would investigate his techniques. When I was a teen the man was a living legend, remember old B&W TV shows featuring his exploits with very short fly rods."
407717,troutologist,2009-12-02 15:59:00,951,"During a smelt run, I have caught lake trout on top raiders trolled into the current at the mouth of a river...."
407894,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-02 23:48:00,0,i'm sure you could catch any game fish on topwater... i wouldnt' be out targeting steelhead with a zara spook however.
407984,ped,2009-12-03 02:27:00,16,"I know what you mean, its hard to imagine a steelhead striking a zara spook, but I recently got a 2 inch zara pooch ordered.Maybe that will imitate insects."
408044,Musky or Specks,2009-12-03 06:40:00,2710,Man I have a sweet gig I do every spring where its all drop back steelies on a dry. The fish are ravenous come June and each pool produces one or 2 fish on the first couple of drifts before they are spooked out of their gourd.
408054,solopaddler,2009-12-03 11:19:00,8605,I've posted this before but it's a very cool video for those that havn't seen it.
