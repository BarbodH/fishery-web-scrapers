407872,bushart,2009-12-02 22:46:00,2628,After watchin the video and TJ sayin this is how his day went---was'nt sure if his day was good or not.  After all that elk was'nt sure if he wanted to wash his feet or not-----Man I hate when that happens.  Bushart
407876,tjsa,2009-12-02 22:50:00,1578,"Yeah, seen that before not to long ago. One of our Biology instructors was using it to demonstrate unusual animal behavior, and challenging the students to try to figure out what it was doing."
407878,misfish,2009-12-02 22:55:00,29133,He was doing the Mambo.   
407886,Roy,2009-12-02 23:31:00,13728,I'd say he was stompin' the dude who shot his Ma! He was doin' the stomp.  And that right there is your feel good clip of the year.

407897,TJQ,2009-12-02 23:49:00,7806, LOL..  point taken....
407901,Skud,2009-12-03 00:05:00,739,Can we switch up that elk for a couple of women in bikini's? That's a 'feel good' scenario too.
407909,Twocoda,2009-12-03 00:21:00,4130, it was trying to cool down ...normally after this episode they roll in the mud...i raised elk and new zeland reds all through the 90s...this was a common site in the spring...when they are shedding their winter coats..  And yes you can never get bored of seeing this .....or the bulls when they do battle in the fall
