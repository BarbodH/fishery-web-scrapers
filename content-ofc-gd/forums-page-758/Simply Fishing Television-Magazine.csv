407830,Fang,2009-12-02 20:47:00,1330,"Welcome to the OFC Josh,  I've been in Marketing for the last 20 years and this is a real and honest reaction of todays consumers.  What I might have suggested is to get some actual positive feedback from a valuable source like OFC members (a lot of $$$ power here) is post a link under contest and provide 25 free copies of the latest magizine and then follow up with each member with a list of selected focused question depending on what type of information your looking to get feedback on.  I spend my days sifting through market research and focus group feedback looking for the next diamond in the rough and fully understand how difficult and competitive some fields are especially when comparing grass roots companies to larger coproration in the same market. Everybodies looking for an edge to sell more product.  Hope you find what you're looking at and here's my two cents. Your magazine has poor if any retail distribution up here. Can't say I've ever seen it on the shelf. As far as the show, I'd agree with most and say from an overall tone it's bit too much like a long commercial."
407861,simplyfishing,2009-12-02 22:15:00,7,"Fang and others,  I suppose I should let you know, as it's a common misconception: The magazine is completely, 100% digital and free. There is no subscription and it's all online -- no print run. This is because when it was started we saw the importance of digital media and the impending decline of print because of operating costs and the popularity of the Internet.  As far as the show, I will pass the words on to the powers that be in that realm.  Marketing sure is a beast to be fought!  Thanks everyone, and pictures etc. are to come!"
408127,David Chong,2009-12-03 16:28:00,836,"I unfortunately have not seen the show to make any kind of comment but I'm not exactly sure what you're implying here but I've worked with a few different shows over the years and to lay claim as the ""only"" .....Please enlighten me. Cheers, Dave"
408142,simplyfishing,2009-12-03 17:30:00,7,"A line will not be wet unless the camera is rolling. All of the catches are filmed in real time with no editing or tricks or splicing. What you see is what you get. I tell you what, all you camera guys out there sure deserve some respect. It's very tiring holding that big camera in the boat all day for months on end.  Perhaps it's not the only show done this way, but that's what I'm told. What other shows are done like this?  Cheers"
408144,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-03 17:42:00,0,I guess the show will be action packed ....with commercials.  ... Hell I doubt even Daves show is done live.... I know the last show I did was full of fish. Not one caught by the stars though...  but you only need 5 fish for a show. They only make it if they have character.   The rest die a slow death.
407448,NAW,2009-12-01 20:13:00,4022,  Thanks for the info Lew..  I didn't see him removing the cut hooks before releasing the fish.  But there could be some editing stuff going on that they don't show on TV??  I shouldn't talk..  The only musky I've ever cought still has my lure in it's mouth
407454,danbouck,2009-12-01 20:21:00,4380,  Hey my shamwow works great!
407462,bubbles,2009-12-01 20:39:00,591, You know the germans make good stuff!
407474,mistaredone,2009-12-01 21:09:00,913,"The man puts BIG fish in the boat every show and thats why I watch.  As for selling product, well there are'nt too many shows that dont to the same extent or worse.  Always wondered about the excessive hook cutting.  Never heard of the magazine.  Always looking for a good read."
407489,bucktail,2009-12-01 21:37:00,1857,"Did anyone ever see the ""80 pound"" muskie he was supposedly showing video of at the spring fishing circuits a few years ago? Does REALLY seem to talk down to people."
407656,dheitzner,2009-12-02 13:35:00,314,"While he does catch big fish, often times their size is grossly exagerated. I've heard him say ""That's easily a 50""er"" way to many times."
407660,JEREMY,2009-12-02 13:46:00,300,"I enjoy the show ,but have not seen it on in a few weeks."
407768,simplyfishing,2009-12-02 18:00:00,7," Thanks for all of the responses so far. First, I know there is not a real definition of SPAM, but I would say this hits pretty close:  ""Spam is the abuse of electronic messaging systems (including most broadcast media, digital delivery systems) to send unsolicited bulk messages indiscriminately. While the most widely recognized form of spam is e-mail spam, the term is applied to similar abuses in other media: instant messaging spam, Usenet newsgroup spam, Web search engine spam, spam in blogs,wiki spam, online classified ads spam, mobile phone messaging spam, Internet forum spam, junk fax transmissions, social networking spam, and file sharing network spam.""  I was indeed trying to drum up conversation about the TV show and the publication, but I did so intentionally on this network. This was not indiscriminate or just some form of mass mailing/posting. I joined this network to participate in conversations about fishing and to make people aware of Simply Fishing. In addition, I welcome all opinions -- especially about the magazine.  Yes, the show and the magazine are driven by advertisers, as are most publications or television shows. I can speak personally for the magazine and tell you that the purpose of SimplyFishingMagazine.com is much like this network -- to provide fishing enthusiasts with content that will appeal to them and bring your connection to fishing one step closer. Instead of instantly becoming SPAM police, perhaps some of the members of this network could put some thought into their responses before they make them.  I hope we can continue to talk fishing, and I hope the magazine will encourage new and potential anglers to support the fishing culture. Enjoy it for what it's worth; after all, it's a free way to get ""on the water"" from your computer.  Don't forget, we're always looking for new ideas for magazine content from YOU, our readers!  Josh Dahlke Editor, SimplyFishingMagazine.com  PS: Simply Fishing Television is the only fishing show shot in real time, with no secret editing or trick shots, and the lures in fact work very well for fishing trophy muskies. Take all of that in consideration before becoming harsh critics."
407771,lew,2009-12-02 18:12:00,12766,"  I'm confused, you come on here and your 1st ever post is asking for our opinion of a TV show, and now that you've received alot of responses you don't seem happy with the answers you got"
407773,irishfield,2009-12-02 18:13:00,26272,Sorry Josh.. but a first post to promote something that pays your bills = spam.  If you had of done this first..   and became part of the forum first you would have been accepted in a whole different light..
407778,johnnyb,2009-12-02 18:19:00,3413,"You asked...I think you have to keep an open mind and use ALL the comments to continually be improving your product.  Instead of getting defensive, look at this board as an opportunity to receive legitimate, honest feedback.  If you have any experience at all (and it sounds like you do) you should expect that not everybody is going to love everything.    Just my $0.02. And for the record, no, I don't think you were trying to promote your site for free (the most common form of spam in these parts)...although you might want to keep the flame-retardant suit handy if you don't respond to honest feedback (read: criticism) well."
407781,Headhunter,2009-12-02 18:27:00,5703,"Some suggestions for you: - provide members here with advice or simply post fish porn... we like that! We don't like folks promoting their wares, what ever they are , unless and until, you have provided value to the community -buy an ad!

407787,John,2009-12-02 18:45:00,2956," Josh, this forum tends to be somewhat self policing with the help of our overworked and underpaid mod's. It is difficult for us to have any other reaction when someone's first post is to promote their product or services."
407788,bigfish1965,2009-12-02 18:48:00,3382,"Josh; Spam, as we define it (and the definition included in the Board Guidelines you agreed to when you signed up) is as follows...  ""Spam will get you banned faster than anything else. Spam is any unsolicited business ad or offer. If someone happens to ask about a product or service you may offer, then you are of course free to mention it. If you come in here and spam, you will be given a pretty rude welcome by the population and it will only hurt your business! We have very reasonable ad rates and can set you up very quickly.Contact TJQ for ad rates.""  Of course what you did was spam. We've been doing this a long time, we know it when we see it. And in your response now, you include more spam (see your PS in your message). You came here under the guise of asking what everyone thought of your show... but your agenda was to increase discussion about your show. You got it. But you didn't like what you saw. There has never been a thread here where everyone liked any one show. NEVER. You totally handled this wrong. We have several great fishing shows that sponsor this site and who give back to the members on a regular occasion. Take a page from guys like Dave Mercer, JP Derose and Jamie Pistilli on how to be a TV host and a valuable part of the community.  This can still go either way."
407792,TJQ,2009-12-02 19:03:00,7806,"Its been said before.. I can be bought...  lol..  anyway.. i think that most people took your original post (as I read it) as trying to make it look like someone that watches the show was posting... which it was obvious that it wasn't.  I think if you would have posted a bit different saying you were involved with the show/magazine and looking for comments it would have gone differently...  no big deal in any case, im in a wonderful mood today!!  And like its been said before...  its easy to put forth the critical opinions on any subject, but if your looking to improve, those should be the ones your looking for anyway.  If your just looking for traffic, then spam it is.  And that Justin Hoffman fellow.. I like his work!! - since 1999.  Don't let this scare you away, kjust post some good reports and pictures.  thats what were all about!!"

407803,Harrison,2009-12-02 19:23:00,2202," John!  Teej, you are one of the fairest folks around.  I know.  Well written response Rick."
407808,simplyfishing,2009-12-02 19:37:00,7,"I apologize for not initially engaging the forum in a different way. I appreciate any and all comments, questions or opinions about the show and the magazine. Of course I did state counter arguments to a few points made by a few of the members, but believe me it’s not because I’m defensive. If this were the case, what kind of journalist would I be?  Once again, I welcome everyone’s opinions. Positive or negative, it’s all very helpful. For me to not respond with my own opinion would be a failure to participate in the discussion. As for the “PS” part of my initial message, that was not a means of promoting the TV show. I was responding to comments made about the integrity of the show and the fish that are caught on the show.  All of this said, thank you everyone for your discussion. As editor, my main priority is getting opinions about the magazine. I mentioned the TV show because it is the root of the magazine, when in fact I have essentially nothing to do with the TV show. To all of the administrators, thank you for having me on your network and I look forward to future dialogue. I will contact your advertising department for future direct promotion of the magazine and further guidelines.  Regards!"
407809,splashhopper,2009-12-02 19:38:00,2931,"Josh..... I am VERY surprised at YOUR REACTION to the feedback that YOU asked for. ( see your last post)  I think an APOLOGY  is in order on your part.... I am pretty sure that a responsible show would NOT want an employee representing their show in your manner....  But then again, maybe they do when, there seems to be a pretty common theme with the comments about the hosts attitude to their guest on the show.... maybe that all flows downhill to the employees....  I can tell you this from my own experience on this board....  there is all kinds of help and experience here that you do NOT want to alienate by your reply. This board has been very helpful to a newbie like my daughter and I.  So, I am going to take the liberty of inviting you to read a post I put up a few months ago when some other new member on the board came in got HIS nose out of joint based on HIS OWN actions.  I hope you will receive this in the spirit it is re-posted.... it is meant to be HELPFUL and to invite you to look at  your OWN role in the responses to YOUR response to our feedback of YOUR first post.  ................................................................................ .................................  Here are a couple of quick suggestions for newbies ( like I was a short while ago) starting out on this board:    1) Tell us about yourself and the fishing you like to do.  2) Post some pics of your latest adventures... they don't have to be big fish either  3) Respond to other posts on the site.... it takes a ""community"" to make a board... please participate  4) Stick to the topic of the particular threads.  5) PLEASE DON'T post honey holes on the board.... even if YOU THINK ""everyone"" knows about them anyways...  6) If you are looking for directions to other fishermen s ""honey holes""... don't bother asking.... they are honey holes for a reason.  7) Ask questions about the type of fishing you want to participate in.... lots of great help here  8) PLEASE don't attack other members on the board.... if you have a beef with them... send them a PM and deal it with like adults.  9) Enjoy your experience here and if you do,, tell others about it....  10) Check out the sponsors ads once in a while ... maybe they do have something you need/want and just don;t know it yet  11) Click on the tab above that says "" our anthem""    My daughter and I have benefited from the very generous support and encouragement of many of the members here.  I hope you do too.  Sincerely,  Splashhopper      PS... if you don't come back with a new attitude, I will sick the 2009 Canadian National Taekwondo Champion on yer ass...( 52 lbs of pure MEAN kicks right to your ribs ! )  lol "
407815,bigfish1965,2009-12-02 19:54:00,3382,"   Answering critique is important if it is easily explainable. Thank you for your follow up. I think things will go much smoother for you.  As for me personally, I have not seen the show. I have heard great things about your host from guys who know musky fishing really well. We know it is tough to put together a show that makes your sponsors happy and not sound like a droning commercial for them. We face the same thing here. Which is the primary reason we protect our sponsors by trying to keep spammy posts to a minimum. The members all support our sponsors, but will also tell them when they think something is wrong. Some stuff you have to look at objectively and some stuff you take with a grain of salt. We exist as a fishing site, yes. But we exist as a community first and foremost. Just look at the thread on raising money for the kids of a member who passed away a few weeks back. This is just the way we grew and it works. The dialogue is often 'frank' but honest. We don't advertise, we don't run at a profit and thats the way we want it."

The host, Bob Mehsikomer, shoots a lot of the TV show up there and the magazine has a lot of articles from Canada. One of Ontario's own, Justin Hoffman, is a writer for the magazine and he puts out some great stuff. Let me know what you think of the show and the magazine and if you have any suggestions, opinions, etc.  Thanks"

407303,lew,2009-12-01 14:14:00,12766,"I do watch the show regularily because I fish for muskies almost exclusively, but as others have said, it's becoming nothing more than an infomercial for the baits he's using and that gets pretty boring after awhile.  He's darned near as bad as Charlie Ray, but not quite.  I did catch Bob's seminar at the Musky Odyssee last April and enjoyed that."
407308,Fang,2009-12-01 14:21:00,1330,"Made the mistake of signing up on line a few years ago to get a free DVD from them. Neat Muskie DVD but it was a 30 minute commercial for the Jackpot lure. Still have it and watch it from time to time, has some great footage of lure follows and boat side hits  The problem was I could not get out of the endless loop of emails about surveys, sales, and so on and so on........  The number of emails was absolutely insane and no way to stop them. Even though I opted out I still get the odd one about signing back up - NO WAY!  I just re-read their original post and it is exactly the tone and solicitation for ideas/thoughts of those emails I used to get!!!"

The one thing that really pissed me off was one episode in particular, where Bob was Musky fishing.  He didn't try to remove one single hook from the musky he caught.  He cut EVERY hook, leaving metal in the fish's mouth.  Didn't even try to remove them first, just snip snip snip!!  What an idiot..  I think you should at least try to remove a hook before cutting it, and leaving metal in the mouth of the fish.  IMO..  I’m not a big musky fisherman, so what do I know.."
407423,John,2009-12-01 19:13:00,2956, Nuttin' unused about my musky rod..and its' extra heavy duty......
407426,lew,2009-12-01 19:18:00,12766,"F-is-H, musky hooks are big with big barbs and can do lots more damage being pulled back out of the fish than they do when their being driven into the mouth and cutting them is a very common practice. Once the shaft has been cut, the pieces are often very easy to extract.  Safer  for the fisherman & easier on the fish.  Are you sure he wasn't removing the pieces after he cut them as I'd be very surprised if he was leaving them all in the mouth ??  Just my thoughts anyways."
