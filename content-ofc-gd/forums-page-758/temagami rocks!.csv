347074,sonny,2009-06-01 23:35:00,511,"Well back from a week in tamagami  with my father and a couple of his longtime freinds,,,they've been going up to camp tamar for 25-30 years.Fishing started off slow the saturday night we arrived and just picked up from there!!  The breeze was blowing all week keeping the bugs down to a minimum which is always a plus!  Together everyone caught fish but my father and i did the best out of the bunch,,,aprox 12 lakers boated along with countless walleye a bunch of pike and to many oss bass!  Oh ya now about the rocks,,,,seems i just did it again,,,yep the skeg on my boat needs a little touching up as well as a new prop!! So here is my question to all the mechanics out there,,,,where can i find mercury parts at a reasonable price?? Looking to replace the propshaft as well!!  Anyway i haven't received pictures of the two biggest walleye of the trip (camera is broke) yet but will post them as soon as i get em!!  1st walleye was caught by my father 26.5 inches weighing in  at 8.3 pounds,,,the 2nd caught by myself came in at 29 inches and a weight of 9 pounds even,,,  It is always a great time with the ol man and his freinds!....can't wait till next time!"

407908,smally21,2009-12-03 00:20:00,993,i know you are in tamar because i recognize the fish cleaning station.  however i dont recognize the fish.  there is NO WAY those fish came out of lake temagami!  they must have hitch hiked there. congrats.
