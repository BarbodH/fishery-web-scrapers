407974,Leecher,2009-12-03 02:15:00,7832,Absolutely incredible Dara   :worthy: Awesome work!!!  I want to see more  How long did that take you to make from start to finish?? I can see in the background that you have a good supply of wood Leechman
407976,Sinker,2009-12-03 02:16:00,8692,Very nice work Dara. The clock is a beauty!!  S.
407982,Dara,2009-12-03 02:25:00,3052,"Thanks Leechman..not real sure how long. There is probably about 40 or 50 hours of work in it. it was a tough one. I generally have a few projects on the go so if I am stalled on one, I can move to another. That was likely in the shop for 3 or 4 months. I get a few hours a night at it, the odd day on a weekend. I have one more wall of wood like that one, and about 300 bd ft of oak sitting outside that has to be moved in soon. I collect wood like you guys collect lures"
407988,Radnine,2009-12-03 02:34:00,1538, This one is my favourite so far. Awesome!! Jim
407989,Leecher,2009-12-03 02:35:00,7832," I kind of figured that it took that long of a time, so much details in the piece..... INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL Again great work and hoping to see more cause that's the kind of work I like to see..... may be a little video on how to.... from start to finish in the future would be awesome!!!  Thanks again Dara and keep up the great work Jacques"

408137,Dara,2009-12-03 17:11:00,3052,I need help designing a really sharp rod holder. Something the wife would let you display your G Loomis or St Croix's in the living room on..or at least the home office/den
408138,Harrison,2009-12-03 17:15:00,2202,"Hey Dara, a friend of mine has a real nice rod ""case"" I guess you could say.  Same design as a gun cabniet, except wood with a glass door.  The top part has a shelf with a light where he puts the reels.  Looks really sharp."
407735,Dara,2009-12-02 17:01:00,3052,"A couple of people here have asked to see some of my shop work, so, here we go.  A set of tables recently shown in another thread and now finished.  "
407740,Dara,2009-12-02 17:06:00,3052,"Since the pics are posting this time...they don't always. Here is my latest.  The top is flame birch and the frame is cherry.  early stages..first dry fit     then after a bunch of tapering, beveling, planing and first coat of tung oil.         "

407786,bubbles,2009-12-02 18:41:00,591,"Nice job, I enjoy woodworking myself just tough to find the time.  Winter is coming and there is plenty of wood in the garage by the stove, still dreaming up this years project"
407791,Dara,2009-12-02 18:53:00,3052,"Thanks for the nice comments guys. Monsterman, PM sent. Yes, its spoken for..housewarming gift for a friend of the wife.

407856,irishfield,2009-12-02 22:09:00,26272, LOL.. she's always looking for something new to build. Lost a 1/5th of my shop to her. This was her first big project.. when she was 16/17    ..and some of her other projects..

407940,rhare,2009-12-03 01:08:00,387,"Awesome! beautiful work.  I love the design of the table, is its your own?   great looking top!  I'm a finish carpenter and have a nice little shop I just dont use all that much,  but your pics are very motivating  thanks for the post!   Ryan"
407955,Dara,2009-12-03 01:57:00,3052,"I'm impressed Irishfield (for some reason I can't recall your name) your daughter does really nice work, and for 16...wow. Thanks for the comments guys..I will put a few more pictures up. I have always loved woodworking but just the last few years gotten the time and tools to really pursue it. Woodworking sites can be great teachers and motivators.    a cremation urn I did a few weeks ago. The name , dates and a maple leaf were laser engraved on it later"
407956,Dara,2009-12-03 02:00:00,3052,A little cabinet in Walnut..It stands about lower chest height.

After High school I just went into carpentry and never went back. Sold all my projects I made in school.   Funny everyone in class amde 3 projects each term while i doubled that.  Yes I was one of those kids who left class just to goto shop class and work. hehe

407962,Whitespinnerbait,2009-12-03 02:05:00,2038,Some fine craftmanship right there..
407966,Dara,2009-12-03 02:10:00,3052,"The book keeper at work wanted a table for his home office. I had done one with a lower shelf. he said he wanted another shelf so he could put family pictures on it. I thought a second shelf would look like a book case rather than a table, so i chopped the shelf so he could arrange different size pictures on it. Maple painted black and  Jatoba (aka brazillian cherry by yhe marketers) with tung oil varnish.     and a couple of tiger maple and jatoba tables.     thats it for now..thanks again guys..yes, most are my own designs...not the clock though..that came from a book"
407970,Dara,2009-12-03 02:13:00,3052,  I'm impressed...there is nothing here to enter. Hopefully you get back into it someday
