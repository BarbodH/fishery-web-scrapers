407612,TerryC,2009-12-02 03:44:00,196,Great work.  However it would have been more realistic with a couple of cleo's hanging out of there backs. lol  Clarence

407638,perchslayer666,2009-12-02 05:35:00,280,"  LOL, or ""Couple o' Boots down by the river sporting bling"" - That's of course if you painted them with a couple cleo's and chrome mustad salmon egg hooks in em'  But seriously, nice paiting something I would consider hanging in my fishing cove at home."
