Someone suggested that I use the Lo-Fi version on the site .... it works well enough for reading the posts..... but I can't seem to find the option to reply to any PM's that are sent....  One I wanted to get back to when I was away too  Does anyone know how to do this?   Thanks  Splashhopper"

I have to goto a specific thread first, and then click on the General Discussion link to get to the forum. I can't just click General Discussion.  An option you can try is to get a different browser.  I use the Blackberry one,  Bolt and Opera Mini.  They all work great for different things."
407372,splashhopper,2009-12-01 17:20:00,2931,Thanks Ultyma.... I will give the Blackberry one a try this weekend.

407396,bigfish1965,2009-12-01 18:15:00,3382,We will soon be upgrading the site software (sooner than we originally thought actually) and it has a much friendlier mobile interface with the new package.
407400,JohnF,2009-12-01 18:28:00,3494," Yeah, on Sunday we were trying to send you some instant pics of the 40 or so pike we were hauling in so you and Rob could join us. Too bad yer Blackberry wasn't workin'.  JF"

407512,splashhopper,2009-12-01 23:12:00,2931," The ""intertrib communications"" I wanted had to do with staying in touch with a fellow OFC member to confirm a meeting time for fishing the next day. ( I didn't have a phone number for the guy except in the PM he sent  Although, it would come in handy so I could keep track of how long some of Union / Anti union posts go before the topic is closed on a whim"
