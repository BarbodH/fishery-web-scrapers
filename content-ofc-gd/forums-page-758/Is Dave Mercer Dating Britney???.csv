407614,Toronto_Angler,2009-12-02 03:50:00,698,LMAO I enjoyed that
407630,Cudz,2009-12-02 04:49:00,2652,When Dave's wife finds out about Britney I bet she whips him with a xtra heavy flippin stick and as he tries to escape her in his Escalade oops I mean Tundra he will likely hit a fire hydrant and crash into a tree rendering himself unconscious.  Luckily his wife (who will still be armed with the flippin stick) will be able to smash out his windows of his truck to make sure he is ok. It is happening to all the big celebs these days. Be careful Dave!
407682,ld17,2009-12-02 14:35:00,319,Ha ha ha what a laugh!

407705,Fishnwire,2009-12-02 15:27:00,983,"I am fairly certain Dave is not Brittney's ""type""."
407737,spinnerbaitking,2009-12-02 17:03:00,1622,"So is Brittney after a foot long or a six incher, hehe Richard"
