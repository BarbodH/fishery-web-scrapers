407403,Paully,2009-12-01 18:41:00,712,"spinners... vibrex # 2 in silver works well most of the time. Sometimes a size smaller others a size bigger, depending on the river conditions..."
407405,asdve23rveavwa,2009-12-01 18:43:00,2690,"Hardware and steelhead seems to be a hot topic over the last week.  I usually only throw spoons of piers, if using lures in a river I prefer Blue Fox spinners in size four or three...these are large rivers, however.  If fishing smaller creeks go as small as one or two.  Kwikfish or Flatfish can also be deadly in slow moving water.  As far as colors...I have had the most luck with Fire Tiger in spinners (possibly more of a confidence thing, had success with it right off the bat)...skunk, black, silver in the plugs."
