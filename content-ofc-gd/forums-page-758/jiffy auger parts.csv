274336,Sinker,2008-12-02 03:27:00,8692,"Have you contacted Jiffy?  My bud broke his 10"" bit and had a hard time finding one. An 8"" on the 3hp motor really cuts ice good  Sinker"
274342,irishfield,2008-12-02 03:32:00,26272,This guy has everything... says free shipping.. but you know that's not gonna be across the border.  http://www.wikco.com/iceaug.html  Scroll down and you'll see all the choices for the 30 for replacement bits...in sizes and styles. ..and you'll wonder what a company in Arizona is doing with ice augers....  Also this place in Ohio  http://www.marine-engine-parts.com/Jiffy.html
274647,steelhedrmatt,2008-12-02 21:45:00,278,"Not sure if this guy will help you, but i bought a coil for my 3hp last winter there. Good service too!!  A1 Small Engine Shop www.A1smallengine.ca 6921 Steeles Ave W #5 416-748-8411"

407738,Terry,2009-12-02 17:04:00,14456,I know where you can get a used one for 125.00 and there is a working powerhead attached to it
407770,jimmer,2009-12-02 18:12:00,2730,"Take these guys that have the part up on their offers. Jiffy engines (you can get parts locally) are separate from all the other parts on the machine.  I have replaced the clutch and main gears a couple of times and had to order them through a company in Mississauga and then they shipped the part to a local authorized dealer.  Both gears were over $100 each, so if you can get your needed part for around $125, get it!  The blades are worth around $50 alone."
407814,Terry,2009-12-02 19:53:00,14456,really maybe I should keep mine for parts and back up I have 2 the same one is just newer then the other...na..it will be in the classified soon
