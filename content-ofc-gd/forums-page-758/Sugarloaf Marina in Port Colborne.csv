408001,bigugli,2009-12-03 03:07:00,6138,Most locals are pretty tight lipped about that location. Some have access as they have keys.
408002,anonymous,2009-12-03 03:12:00,58,"Well Sugarloaf isn't exactly a secret. There are lots of perch, some pike and I caught a small musky there once. I used to have the code for the doors but have been out of the loop for some time now. Generally once the boats are all out they just leave the doors unlocked. Might take a swing by tomorrow and see if anything is going on."

408080,jasonl,2009-12-03 13:42:00,29,I live a few blocks from the marina. I'll be flying home tonight and was thinking of heading down to cast some lines tomorrow if the weather co operates. What time are you thinking of going?
