407576,joonmoon,2009-12-02 02:17:00,528,"Looks to me that the mail man and BPS is at fault here. I just got the flyer on the Thursday and we went to BPS Saturday. The flyer I got in the mail didn't say anything regarding when the sale started or nothing in there about while supplies last...So after talking to the rep and he didn't give me any inclination as to when the next shipment was to come in nor did he offer a rain check nor did he offer to give me the thermal(the photo in the flyer) at the price advertised. So I'm a little disappointed now it looks like they feel they don't need my $$$. If anyone else wants to deal with a company that doesn't really care about customer service (IMO) then be my guest, I know I don't. I'm not bashing BPS but rather their lack of quality service. Thats all I'm gonna say."
407829,steverowbotham,2009-12-02 20:45:00,1800," You're right about the flyer date, I was kind of peeved that it didnt have a start date listed.  As far as the other issues are concerned,  The ""rep"" has no idea when the next shipment is due because we have no way of knowing, this information is not provided to the staff.  The manifests come when the truck is shipped.  We can not offer rain checks on ice huts, because due to a limited supply, we can not guarantee we will receive more.  The employee's can not just give you a hut for a lower price, they do not have the authority to do that.  Hope this clears some things up."
408297,irishfield,2009-12-04 01:30:00,26272,If you are still stuck on a Nanook... Trombly's (in Orillia) Christmas flyer just arrived.. shows the Nanook for $299.99. Call and pay for one by phone and then pick it up!! 705-327-3474 Also show the Yukon TL for $499.99
406738,joonmoon,2009-11-29 22:49:00,528,"Got the flyer in the mail just the other day and planned a visit on Sat morn because of a sale on the new Clam Fliphut Nanook. As usual my wife and I drive for an hour and BPS disappoints once again. We head to the ice fishing gear with high hopes of anticipation on getting a good deal on a nice new hut. I see the portables all set up and just like a kid in the candy store I'm in there checkin them out like a dirty shirt. But wait I can't find the one they advertised for $249. Where can it be. Then I read a sign they have on the insulated Clam Nanook that says something bout the price in the flyer and the picture they used don't match. Sorry for the inconvience. Sorry for the inconvience....geez glad we only drove for and hour to get there. I asked about the regular hut and the rep said they were sold out long time ago and that the manufacturer isn't giving them enough stock......Man was I peeved. After ranting to my better half and complaining to myself and looking at all the other over priced portable huts I decided the best way to get back at them is to take my $500 plus that I was going to spend and go elsewhere. So if anyone knows of somewhere I can buy a new two man flip style portable hut at a good price let me know. I think my days of spending mega bucks at BPS are over, I would drive farther to spend less now....GGGGGRRRRRRRRRR."

406747,crappieperchhunter,2009-11-29 23:10:00,2582,Have never been impressed with Bass Pro. I went last fall to get Rocky boots on sale...the ones I wanted all GONE. Tried to get a floater suit last winter. Priced them at Bass pro cause I was out there. Then priced them in Oshawa where I live and they were $30 cheaper at Gagnon's in Oshawa.  I'm sure if I lived closer I would go more....but it certainly is not worth the drive from Oshawa.
406750,mbac31,2009-11-29 23:14:00,904,Call Blake at Fishingworld. Small store service. Big box  prices.  One on one all the time and Prices are great. I drive from the East End all the time just for the Service. Everyone in that store is good at what they do. They just know about fishing and not something they should'nt.
406752,perchslayer666,2009-11-29 23:16:00,280,"    Sorry to hear about your day JM, wasn't this sale on since the beginning of November? My experience with sales at BPS, if it's a great deal it will sell out fast... these were probably gone in a week at that price. Personally i've had a lot of good experiences with BPS, and when stuff like this happens you got to just deal with it. Companies  like BPS spend a ton of money on print ads (usually done by an outside marketing company) and mistakes do happen....just got to take it in stride and understanding. Always call ahead!!!!"
406754,irishfield,2009-11-29 23:21:00,26272,We stopped there on the 12th of November to pick up Dano on our way to BOQ. He bought and loaded a hut into his van before we left for Napanee in my Truck. Stated the sale had already been on for about 10 days and the huts had just come in that day. He'd been calling the store trying to get one. He wasn't taking a chance of waiting until Sunday and grabbed one on the Thursday. They had only received in 7 of the model he got ( I think the Yukon insulated roof). Pickins probably slim 2 weeks later.
406758,NAC,2009-11-29 23:25:00,369,"tough one bud, hope you get it figured out by january for simcoe."
406767,Joey,2009-11-29 23:36:00,9122,"Learning from experience, I always call first to any fishing store, and I get the name of the person I talked to.  Saves me gas and aggravation.  Sorry to hear you are disappointed.  It sucks for sure.  Joey"
406776,Burtess,2009-11-29 23:46:00,901,  X2.......  Burt
406781,young_one,2009-11-29 23:53:00,620,Did you mean 279? or 249? Cause I bought a Nanook 2 weeks ago for 279 + tax... back then I could swear there were 8+ units in stock at the back. Man they sell fast...
406787,GBW,2009-11-30 00:00:00,8460,"LeBaron.  And with a club card you save 10% as well. no I don't work there but I do shop there a whole heck of a lot, LOL!"
406818,crappieperchhunter,2009-11-30 01:07:00,2582,Fishing world is way out of my way. But any dealings I have had with them have been excellent. I agree with others that have posted  this.
406822,dheitzner,2009-11-30 01:12:00,314,"If you want firs pick for ice fishing stuff at BPS or Lebaron for that matter, better get there at the beginning of November.  They have limited stock and it sells out fast. Moreover, the service at both Bass Pro and Lebaron has been a consistent disappointment to me for a number of years.  Sometimes I'm not sure if the sales reps don't know what they are talking about or if they just don't give a crap. For the last number of years I have opted for online shopping if possible, but I guess the shipping will be a nightmare for a 2 man portable.  Maybe try getting your local store to order one in for you? (Un)fortunately it looks like you have a while to sort it out before first ice..."
406900,Mattones,2009-11-30 03:05:00,587,My friend and I went Saturday Morning aswell as he wanted to buy a bore sighter and the flyer had it for cheaper then on the price marked. Went to find a flyer but they were all out. he still bought it.
406909,Jon,2009-11-30 03:16:00,209,Sorry to hear about your bad luck with the long drive and service issues at BPS.  My experience with a pricing issue on an ice hut at Bass Pro a couple of years ago was positive.  The price in the flyer was $100 cheaper than it should have been and BPS honoured the price.  I can't say my recent experiences with Best Buy and Amazon honouring misprinted prices turned out so well.  At least Best Buy gave me a $10 coupon for the error - nothing from Amazon.
406913,ld17,2009-11-30 03:23:00,319,Does everyone remember the sale Bass pro had I think it was a year or so ago.  Titanium spinner baits for like 3-4 bucks regular price was like 12 bucks.  Well my buddy and I went very early in the morning before they opened and when we got there there was a big line up.  Doors open everyone rushes in and I didn't even get to the bin with the spinner baits and they were sold out.  Like a pack of piranhas I tell you.  They only had 50 units.  Everyone complained and they did nothing.  I learned my lesson with bass pro.  Be the first in the door for the sale or call before you go if you live far away.  Sorry to hear you didn't get what you wanted.  I guess they lack in service like the smaller shops that care about your business.
406949,Greencoachdog,2009-11-30 13:41:00,8163,HURRY!... quantities are limited!
407019,FSNmachine,2009-11-30 17:37:00,22,"Log onto skunked.ca and send a message to ""Eric the Pirate"". He runs a couple of tackle shops and I know he can get you Clam gear at a good price. You may have to drive to Wallaceburg to pick it up but you can inquire of his price at least."
407121,steverowbotham,2009-11-30 22:25:00,1800,"As a bass pro employee, we do our best to help our customers and when an item has been on sale for an entire month, how can you expect high stock?  We got a shipment of Nanooks today, and we sold out today. It's that time of year, great prices and people are all over it, the early bird gets the worm."
407125,misfish,2009-11-30 22:33:00,29133,"  Steve a question.  If one of our members here,wanted a product that was on sale,could you hold it for them?  Just asking,not trying to put you on the spot.  And to add,if one did ask of this favor,dont screw Steve over."
407129,fishermccann,2009-11-30 22:39:00,655,Yes we should have an IN as he is ONE OF US.
407132,steverowbotham,2009-11-30 22:44:00,1800," no can do partner, we cannot hold any sale items.  If there was a hold tag on it, and someone wanted to buy it who was there, it would be sold, no questions.  It's just policy, and I love OFC, but its not worth my job I can tell you that."
407134,misfish,2009-11-30 22:48:00,29133,"Thanks Steve,was just asking.  Yep, yer job is not worth it."
407412,Fang,2009-12-01 18:52:00,1330,"Looks like they did it again. A few weeks ago the Nanook was on sale for $279. In that flyer as well as this one they've shown the Nanook Thermal. I was there first day of sale and picked a Nanook up for $279 and at that time they had just received a truckload delivery. In the warehouse there was pallets of Nanooks everywhere, the regular one not the Thermal."
407523,PitViper,2009-12-01 23:53:00,33,Hey Steve  If an Item is on sale and BPS is sold out could we order the item in for the next delivery?
