407549,bassman,2009-12-02 01:17:00,384,I was looking for a review and/or opinion on the Yamaha G3 Boats. They appear to be well built and are considerably less than the some of the bigger boys ie. Lund and Princecraft.  Anyone on the board have one?  Thanks!
407550,Spiel,2009-12-02 01:20:00,9065,I'm sure Gerritt will chime in. He had or perhaps still has one. Solid boat in my opinion.
407574,BUSTER,2009-12-02 02:09:00,1336,I hear good things
407577,Dara,2009-12-02 02:20:00,3052,I never knew they were less...I think they are pretty good boats
407584,Dave Mercer,2009-12-02 02:50:00,148,They are great very well built I have been running one for 4 years. Hey Buster steal me that sign lol!
407585,limeyangler,2009-12-02 02:51:00,5204,Good Boats
407592,John Bacon,2009-12-02 03:04:00,3277,  Considerably less than Lund or Princecraft?  Are you sure?  Where are getting your prices from?   I am sure they are a good boat; but they have always seemed expensive to me.
407613,irishfield,2009-12-02 03:45:00,26272,"Yep.. price JUST the boat and compare it to JUST the boat from Lund or Princecraft. My Lund is darn near valueless, in the grand scheme of things, when you take away the Verado/Kicker, options and toys! Don't be fooled on package price by falling for a ""Legend style"" prepackage MSRP..."
407622,linweir,2009-12-02 04:07:00,202,"New age G3 boats are well-built, and expensive. Under same price, I would rather take Crestliner."
407627,GBW,2009-12-02 04:44:00,8460,"HAHAHAHA, I was wondering when you would notice that..."
407654,craigdritchie,2009-12-02 13:26:00,1586,"G3 is a solid boat. I drove the 2010 175 and 185 models on Lake Couchiching recently, and they're very sweet rides. I'd buy one.  2009 was a very bad year in the boat business, and at this point, more than 50 percent of the North American boat industry is now unemployed. Yet in the midst of all that, G3 had record sales last year. That says a lot."
407657,lifeisfun,2009-12-02 13:35:00,99,Got one and love it However I wouldn't call it cheap
407674,ld17,2009-12-02 14:27:00,319,"if you look at yamaha web site the price of the boats look very cheap, but and it's a big but, that price is for the hull only you still have to buy a motor to go with it.  So first look at the price seems very cheap.  Don't get fooled Yamaha boats cost just as much as other boats out there.  Very nice boat, I want one!"
407725,lifeisfun,2009-12-02 16:20:00,99,"You right, that would be deal of the century"
407729,bassman,2009-12-02 16:49:00,384,"Thanks for the tips, and yes, I couldn't tell if the web price included a motor or not.  Dave, I thought you were a Skeeter guy. Which G3 are you using?"
407810,BUSTER,2009-12-02 19:47:00,1336,trade for your old motor?  lol
408064,Garnet,2009-12-03 12:08:00,2056,Skeeter and G3 are Yamaha group boats.  Garnet
408100,Abraxus,2009-12-03 14:57:00,104,I agree with Irishfield. G3's are good boats and dont buy a legend!  lol  Ab
408128,David Chong,2009-12-03 16:32:00,836,"I've fished out of several G3's over the years & they've come a long way! They are great boats and not necessarily cheap but you usually get what you pay for!  Cheers, Dave"
408161,Marty,2009-12-03 18:38:00,873,This is one of their first models.   Great to fish from but there were some issues with the bolts holding and panels getting loose.   I understand they've made some upgrades.
