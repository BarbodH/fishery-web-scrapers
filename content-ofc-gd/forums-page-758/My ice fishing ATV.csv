406057,ChrisK,2009-11-27 15:14:00,2772,"Sweet set up !!! Love the color as well,my fav....."
406071,John,2009-11-27 15:31:00,2956, Great set up....  You might want to give some thought to the propane cylinder mount. All consumer propane cylinders should be stored upright so that the relief valve is in contact with the propane vapour rather than the propane liquid. If the relief valve does open while in contact with liquid propane there is a much greater danger of explosion if in the vicinity of open flame. This is especially the case if you store in a garage....
406082,richyb,2009-11-27 15:51:00,774,Sweet set up !  Im a CAT man and love the green. I have the same bike but without the speedo and I had to get red because green wasnt in stock  Just a little heads up. Last winter I heard people were getting charged on simcoe for riding 2 people on an ATV even with an extra seat. The atv has to be manufactured with the second seat for it to be legal.
406107,pxtyson,2009-11-27 16:52:00,21,  I heard that to but spent many weekends out there and never once seen a cop. With all the drunks out there the last thing they need to worry about is me and my passenger.  I may stick out like a sore thumb now with the bright green quad though  ohh well
406145,cityfisher,2009-11-27 18:47:00,959,very nice ! !  i bought an popo x2 last year so i dont have to wory about LEGAL 2 up riding anymore
406171,moose,2009-11-27 20:36:00,266,do u plan on making any to sell i have a 2003  arctivc cat and would be interested
406188,Sandbag,2009-11-27 22:01:00,533,Wow...very nice job.  Great looking quad you have there.  Should be able to spot that baby out of the lake.  Cheers  Craig
406192,pxtyson,2009-11-27 22:09:00,21,"  That is very tempting but no.  My family all know that I like to cut wood as a hobby so I already have a list of stuff to make. And christmas is around the corner and there needs to be a toy box under the tree for my new nephew.  This is gonna be a cool build though, I am making the toy box to resemble an old bait and tackle store. My brother in law is also a crazy fisherman so what better then to build his son a bait and tackle toy box."
406238,Leecher,2009-11-28 00:01:00,7832,COOL setup you have made pxtyson Awesome craftsmanship... congratulations  I can see you pay particular attention to details..... I'm the same way Love the decals and paint job Now all you need is to get into some fish this up coming hard water season and you're all set Thanks for sharing Leechman
406304,ohhenrygsr,2009-11-28 07:14:00,947,Awesome setup but every time you gear up your atv it reminds me of this
406431,redneck666,2009-11-28 23:10:00,563,"got a question for ya, is your quad a belt drive?"
407120,pxtyson,2009-11-30 22:19:00,21,  Yeah it is a belt drive
407473,bubbles,2009-12-01 21:06:00,591,  That explains why you only have a limited amount of rods on it!!!!  LOL  Great Job!
405727,pxtyson,2009-11-26 18:45:00,21,I built the front box last winter but never had the time to paint it. Just gave it a coat of primer and went fishing.  This fall I spent a bit of time cutting and painting in the garage.  Have a look   LAST YEAR FRONT BOX JUST BUILT    THIS YEAR PAINTED        I also needed a new back seat with some function.  Where to put the GAS AUGER? Ihh its cold out the so I also wanted to bring out a propane tank and started last year bringing a 20lb. I went smaller with a 5lb this year and where the 20lb went I will now put my bucket            
405729,Harrison,2009-11-26 18:49:00,2202,MINT!  Wicked set up.  I can see why it took alittle while with the distractions on the wall.
405730,pxtyson,2009-11-26 18:50:00,21,  Everyone needs a HOOTERS calendar in their garage
405731,irishfield,2009-11-26 18:51:00,26272,I think Terry just had an orgasm!!  Some nice work there fella..
405732,anders,2009-11-26 18:58:00,1168,Very Cool Set Up
405735,tambo,2009-11-26 19:03:00,85,cool setup
405739,johnnyb,2009-11-26 19:13:00,3413,"Hey, I saw that on the Shant....very very nice!!!"
405740,Uncle Buck,2009-11-26 19:20:00,1000,awesome!!!  great job
405744,pike slayer,2009-11-26 19:34:00,1177,"very nice set up, to bad that would make it 10feet in this part of the woods. throw some tracks on it and that will be the ulitmate mean machine"
405745,lew,2009-11-26 19:35:00,12766,Always nice to see the finished product of someone who knows their way around the workshop.  Great job !!
405747,Rustic-Fisher,2009-11-26 19:40:00,826,Very nice set up!!  RF
405750,Terry,2009-11-26 19:45:00,14456, you know me too well...scary     but that is great
405753,GeorgeJ,2009-11-26 19:54:00,207,"looks great, my only thought and not a criticism is that you are carrying a lot of weight up high so be careful for uneven ice, again nice job. Here is what I'm setting up for ice this year I just got it, has tracks too. Someone suggested tracks for your ATV that really would make it an ultimate ice fishing machine. Have fun! "
405757,walleyejigger,2009-11-26 20:00:00,876,"that is wicked, good job, and u got sponsors to boot...lol"
405768,LucG,2009-11-26 20:15:00,779,I'm speechless! All you need is a foldout fishing hut and your set. lol  So are you taking orders? lol
405769,pxtyson,2009-11-26 20:17:00,21,  I have a CLAM CORP fishtrap yukon that I tow behind it. I made the box for when I go out by myself without the hut.  I have the hut mainly for the wife or REALLY cold days
405770,GeorgeJ,2009-11-26 20:19:00,207,"pxtyson I think it be a great idea to see other ice fishing rigs, I know I got a couple ideas just from seeing your set up. I'm not sure that would be a high jack of your thread so maybe a new one could be started if there is interest."
405773,pxtyson,2009-11-26 20:23:00,21,"  I have used the front box all last season just never had the time to paint it. There is really no off balance issues with it, the only thing is it limits the view of the front tires when approaching obstacles  The nice thing is that if it where to ever go thru the ice the front box is water tight and will keep it afloat, or at least I hope."
405776,ciceri,2009-11-26 20:29:00,535,"That's crazy man.. thats craftsmanship right there, nice clean work man.. I need something like that for the sled."
405780,pxtyson,2009-11-26 20:36:00,21,"  I am a tool and die maker by trade and only do wood work as a hobby. If you look in the background of some of the pics there is a really big cabinet, that was my summer project. cost a fortune in plywood and hardware but it is my nicest toolbox ever.  Being a tool maker perfection is key and that carries over into my wood work which at times can be a little frustrating."
405785,ciceri,2009-11-26 20:44:00,535," I know what you mean.. I made this small Muskoka chair for my little cousin in Grade 11 woodshop, it was so hard to make everything perfect, but it still turned out great and I am very proud of it. Wish I had a picture to post."
405798,Dara,2009-11-26 21:01:00,3052,Nice job...looks like you have the patience it takes..did I hear woodworker?   not to hijack but...current project.  
405802,pxtyson,2009-11-26 21:08:00,21,"  They are looking really nice.  I have yet to get into fine carpentry, apart from some fish tank stands and tv stand. I am waiting until I move next summer to upgrade to some larger equiptment and then try my hands at some stuff like you are building."
405806,fish-miester,2009-11-26 21:22:00,864,"wow, thats looks awesome!"
406052,redneck666,2009-11-27 15:07:00,563,now that is a SWEET set up for sure man! i cant wait till i get my quad this spring.
