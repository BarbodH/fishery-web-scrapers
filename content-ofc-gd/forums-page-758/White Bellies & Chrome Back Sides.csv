407118,laszlo,2009-11-30 22:08:00,487,"It took a few hours for the fish to wake up this morning but once they did...they were on BIG TIME!  I went 6 for 7 Stonefly went 4 for 4 while I was there. Not sure what went down after I had left.  His first fish of the day. The white is blinding.     My two nicest fish were both of this size.     And then my biggest brown to date. Didn't have a tape but I'm thinking around 22"".     We ended the day with a double header, both fighting our biggest fish of the day. Naturally we were all smiles!  Thanks again Mike. You should become a guide. Looking forward to seeing your pics.  Thanks for reading.  Laszer."

407164,douG,2009-12-01 00:39:00,2693,"Great payoff for some hard work.  Congratulations, nice snaps too."
407192,BillM,2009-12-01 02:07:00,17367,"Nice brown, that looks like a resident fish."
407194,StoneFly,2009-12-01 02:11:00,574,"Why resident Bill?  Just asking,..I have no idea...my thought was it just came in with the very fresh run...but came in late...thoughts?"
407195,tibbs,2009-12-01 02:16:00,650,Looks like you guys had a great day!
407196,BillM,2009-12-01 02:24:00,17367," Just a wild guess.  No chrome, very yellow belly, bigger spots, not very fat.. etc etc.  Gorgeous fish, I love those brownies."

SALMON....What you talkin bout Willis ?....there is a whole lotta chromin to be had before the nookies,..atleast 6 more months,..and then nookies in in about 8 months or so..and ..hopefully many Cohos and God willing ATlantics"

407317,highdrifter,2009-12-01 14:40:00,2534,"Good work bone diddlies!!  I'd say Lazer's brown is a resie.  Paul, your chrome brown looks to be an alewife muncher...  cheers HD"
407364,Paulus,2009-12-01 17:10:00,522," Same fish different view    coulda been on its way down (or wintering/recovering), I suppose. Very unlikely that it would be a fresh returning fish, that late in the season, with those colours. I've seen residents that look just like laszlo's and I've seen them green-backed just like the one I showed, in May, chasing steelie eggs way up in the headwaters of the Ganny. There isn't just one colour pattern, imo.  But what really matters is that Laz got himself a nice brown. Either way, sweet bonus fish  p.-"
407387,highdrifter,2009-12-01 17:59:00,2534," My tourny partner landed a fish very similar to that one.  We were fishing late spring droppies at the time..  The fish was tagged the fall before and we caught it above Norval the following spring...  Even though it's diet changed, it retained the colours it had from the lake..  That's a splendid fish though mon fr√®re!!  cheers HD"
407501,ccmtcanada,2009-12-01 22:31:00,7971,Sweet fish!!! Great job out there...and those surprise brown are ALWAYS a nice bonus!
