399665,tonyb,2009-11-05 15:58:00,1637,"This is just a quick post asking if you could please register at the link below and place a vote to support Jeff's neat idea. You can vote once each day for the next 10 days to help increase his chances of success, and for each vote you will get an additional name entered in the draw.  As an added incentive, everyone who leaves a comment after registering and voting should PM me their screen name used on the Aviva site comments to be entered into a draw to win a fishing trip of a lifetime (LOL) and a tackle package of various fishing related items valued at over $100! See bottom of this post for prize details.  http://www.avivacommunityfund.org/ideas/acf3104    The Idea  The Backyard Harvest is a community-based gardening Program where youth are empowered to build, maintain and harvest small-scale organic vegetable ' farms ' in local backyards.  The Plan  The plan is to begin on a local level within the Greater Toronto Area to create change within the community and expand outward. The Program aims to equip youth with bicycles, trailers and garden tools to grow organic food in private residential backyards. If selected, the support offered by the Aviva Community Fund would provide the purchase of this equipment necessary to begin the initiative.  The Longevity  Each family pays a fee in exchange for the maintenance of the backyard garden and the harvesting of vegetables. These fees will ensure the longevity of the Program. The income that students earn will help to further their education, be it college or university. Additional income will sustain the future of thisProgram, with the added benefit of scholarships to the youth involved. Surplus food generated from backyard gardens will be donated to community-based food banks and kitchens.  The Impact  In our highly accelerated and fast-paced society and culture, there has never been a greater need to reconnect with nature and adopt a more healthy and sustainable lifestyle. Youth employed by thisProgram will acquire essential skills with a blend of entrepreneurship, healthy living, leadership and responsibility.  The Outcome  Through this unique employment opportunity of developing and maintaining individual backyard organic vegetable ' farms ' , youth reconnect with the earth and expand their awareness of environmental issues, food production and healthy living strategies. This initiative has the aim of not only educating our youth and the extended community, but has the potential to take root across Canada.  Here's Jeff last spring with a feisty Chinook caught near Port Weller to keep this sort of on-topic as I believe that if we are eating and drinking from local sources, we will inherently treat that environment better, and that benefits all fish and wildlife.
