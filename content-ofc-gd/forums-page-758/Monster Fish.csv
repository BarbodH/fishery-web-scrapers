The host is a marine biologist that specializes in the largest fish in the world.  Anyway, he goes around the world studying the largest freshwater fish in the world. The episode the I watched, the host was in Mongolia studying the timan (sp?) The world's largest trout.  It was kind of cool, y'all should check it out  Dave"

Here's Zeb with a 'baby' taimen   Been compiling a list of monster freshwater fish I wanna catch at least once in my lifetime since I was a kid: Sturgeon, taimen, mahseer, arapaima, giant amazonian catfish, etc...I'm sure after I catch a Taimen, I probably wouldn't look at steelhead the same again"
