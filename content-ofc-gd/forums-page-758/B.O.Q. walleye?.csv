408203,fish_fishburn,2009-12-03 21:10:00,1311,Was just wondering if anyone has been fishing the Bay of Quinty for walleye lately. I was there last week from thursday till sunday and the fishing was terribly slow.  I was in the Thompson Point area and we caught three fish in three days.  Lots of fisherman jigging and trolling and lots of skunks. I was there last year on the same weekend and the water was about 8 degrees colder and there was fish everywhere. I think we caught something like twenty five fish last year. I guess all the nice weather we have had have set everything back a few weeks. Was also wondering if it ws like this all over the boq or were some areas producing fish during this time period. Oh yeah we still had agreat time and fished our asses off. Thats it for the walleye fishing for me this year. Now all we need is some cold weather. Thanks Fish.
