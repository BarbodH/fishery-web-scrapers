408125,Headhunter,2009-12-03 16:25:00,5703,"Nice Pickereye! A suggestion if I may be so bold, if you are not planning on keeping that beauty, you may want to consider supporting the belly of the fish when taking pics. Again, nice Pickereye! HH"

408332,GBW,2009-12-04 03:18:00,8460,welcome to OFC Kevin. Check out an online account like photobucket or imageshack to share your pic's.  they take up no space on this server and they are a much larger pic for all to see.  just a thought as I can't tell if you are holding a fish or real bad moldy stick of french loaf...    right Roy
