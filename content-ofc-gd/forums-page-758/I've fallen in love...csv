408000,scuro2,2009-12-03 03:04:00,904,"Bought a 1/2 dozen new Yo-zuri lures for down south where sparkle and flash is everything. That got me thinkin', hey I probably could use them up here!    Anyone care to share lure type and applications for these lures in our waters?  This one will be nice on in the morning or cloudy Cuban winter day...trolled slowly."
408003,Slop,2009-12-03 03:18:00,151,Long cast to suspected quarry. Mind set on target should be to impart injured look. Reel down on slack line. Twitch....twitch...reel up slack..twitch....twitch....twitch/ pause.  Repeat.
408004,Leecher,2009-12-03 03:20:00,7832, Sorry scuro never heard of them lures.... What are they?? Leechman
408005,scuro2,2009-12-03 03:22:00,904,"Regular lures  but with some of the most attractive finishes that one could imagine. Photos don't do them justice. They reflect an incredible amount of light with their, ""brilliant holographic laser finish "".  Another beaut I can't wait to try. Of course they may prove to be no better then any other lure but for the moment I am smitten. Wonder how some of these lures would do with Lakers, or for that matter bass or pike."
408007,ped,2009-12-03 03:48:00,16,They look a lot like the new Rapala maxrap thats going to be out! Those yo-zuri lures must be really long casting.
408012,Leecher,2009-12-03 03:55:00,7832, Nice.... Thanks for the pic.... looks like a trolling lure to me with the long bill don't you think??? Leechman
408014,scuro2,2009-12-03 03:57:00,904,They have a large selection of different styles of lures. I have the one above without the large lip.
408015,Leecher,2009-12-03 04:01:00,7832," So in other words a short lip that resembled a crank bait???  If so, do like slope said  You can't go wrong!!! Leechman"
408016,irishfield,2009-12-03 04:02:00,26272,Just watch you dont' get spoofs online being sold as YO- ZURI.. that are actually YD-ZURI's
408021,pike slayer,2009-12-03 04:09:00,1177,my buddy that has done quite a bit of guiding swears by yo zuri cranks. western only carries a couple and they are all floating cranks. i'd like to find some suspending yo zuris and give them a go. definitely some good looking lures.
408022,scuro2,2009-12-03 04:11:00,904,"No..no..no, they have every style of lure that Rapala would make...be it a popper, suspending, crankbait or whatever. The question is does anyone have any experience fishing these lures where they feel that these laser reflective surfaces really make a difference? Or are they just another pretty surface?"
408027,Cudz,2009-12-03 04:42:00,2652,"I used to fish Yo-zuri in the ocean for Kingfish, queenfish and grouper.  Very good lures.  Always ran true and caught fish on par with rapalas."

408068,dheitzner,2009-12-03 12:46:00,314,I have had pretty good success with the Yo-Zuri Crystal Minnow(sus.) for shmallies in the last year or so...
408075,musky66,2009-12-03 13:07:00,273,Have used them for Musky in the Kawartha's- solid lures for sure.
408079,limeyangler,2009-12-03 13:36:00,5204,I used the Chrystal Minnows for Sea Bass (like striped bass) in England....AWESOME LURES!
408085,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-03 13:56:00,0,"they work well in Cuba in the shallows. Bridge fishing is great with them at night. The current will take your line out farther than you can cast. Makes for a nice long retrieve for cubera, snook tarpon, permit and jack. The only probelm is they only last for two cubera....maybe less....lol"
408090,TDunn,2009-12-03 14:12:00,680,I use them regularly up here for Atlantics....Expensive but great lures   TDunn
408107,Garry2Rs,2009-12-03 15:16:00,1425,"I bought a couple of crystal minnow's 9 or 10 years ago. The finish is deep and liquid-looking. As I recall, at that time the available colours were all bright pastels, like pink and chartreuse. I'm sure that I still have one lurking in a tackle box somewhere... I believe that the ones I had came with very small diving lips. They were a 3 or 4 inch long bait and worked best as jerkbaits."
408146,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-03 17:55:00,0,ive used them for eyes but could see them being effecting for lots of fish. the hooks on my yozuri crank are the sharpest in my box...
