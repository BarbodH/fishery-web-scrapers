Don't know who the creator is but to me, this... a work of art    if only it could be called graffiti  She said that while going down the stairs... couldn't see a thing   but once at the bottom of the stairs and turned around  Enjoy!

730073,shane,2012-09-16 00:25:00,652,That is really cool. I saw an exhibition of these eco-art photos the last time I was in Ottawa. Really big pictures about 8 ft. by 6 ft. They were done on a cement wall in a pedestrian underpass. The stairway idea is brilliant. Still can't figure out how they do it though. It's not painted on. It must be some type of printing process.
