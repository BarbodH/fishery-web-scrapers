729995,Joey,2012-09-15 16:17:00,9122,Well I know Ron is one of them
729997,Roy,2012-09-15 16:46:00,13728, Yeah and his partner seems to be pulling his weight too. Standing around while Ron gets the job done.
730012,Handlebarz,2012-09-15 18:36:00,3790,I know one just got a nice musky on a Handlebarz and is very happy looks about the same as in that pic
730424,Michael_Brown,2012-09-17 04:42:00,411, It is a five fish limit. Bass & walleye combo. Most walleye weighed in get donated for the dinner but trust me the dinner alone is worth fishing this event. Great time had by all.
730473,Harrison,2012-09-17 13:18:00,2202,"That be Mr Giles and Mr. Reynes.  Sounds like fun, like to fish it this year and see Rons fillet skills in person for a second time."
730551,Ron,2012-09-17 18:53:00,1683,"Gee thanks for posting that Mike.... Your a great friend..... NOT!  Hey it was all in great fun. I now understand why people claim to say they don't know how to fillet fish though. You gonna make it out Phil?   Cheers, Ron..."
730560,Stoty,2012-09-17 19:12:00,2910,When is the event?
730570,Ron,2012-09-17 19:39:00,1683, The date is September 30th. Give Ben a call for more info. He can be reached at 905 797-2632
730573,Harrison,2012-09-17 19:45:00,2202," I am working on it as we speak Ron, have a couple feelers out.  Have to better the odds of you filleting again somehow!"
730575,Stoty,2012-09-17 19:50:00,2910, Thanks Ron. Is that Ben from BJ's?
