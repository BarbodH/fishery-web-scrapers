730626,Ron,2012-09-17 23:07:00,1683,"OK, so the truth comes out.... There is no way he is my Son. Loosing tackle like that in the river and being caught on tape is just hilarious!!!  I like the first 2 videos you posted as well. And do you think there is a shortage of COs???  Cheers, Ron..."
730627,Christopheraaron,2012-09-17 23:11:00,3525," hmmm, let's see, YES!!! Of course we already know this."
