730227,Cloudy15,2012-09-16 18:25:00,141,After reading the thread on line choice. I bought stren soinic braid 8lb 300yrds 32 bucks didnt seem like a great price and also bought stren fluorocast 10lb for my leader. Curious how you attach your fluorocarbon leader. I used a barrel swivel in the past with the plamer knot and found i was breaking off alot. I was curious is this line combo would make a good drop shot rig?  thanks
