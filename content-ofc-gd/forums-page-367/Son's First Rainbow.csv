Had 2 knock off's and then this nice 6-7 lbs rainbow hit a NK Monkey Puke. I grabbed the pole set the hook and handed it off to my son, he did the rest. I was too busy cranking up the downriggers( I need elec riggers ). A quick pic and off to swim another day. Cheers Scooter"

730603,spincast,2012-09-17 21:29:00,3279,"that'll get him hooked. NIce fish - and yep, electrics are the only way to go if you plan on regular riggin."
730604,davey buoy,2012-09-17 21:30:00,5505," Nice of you to point that out. I saw that as well. We all make mistakes from time to time with good intentions. One time I had a stringer of fish that were released,and nobody noticed they weren't hung from the gill,but just inside there bottom lip. All were good. Made a nice picture shot.! Oh,nice fish by the way!!!!!!!"
730613,Scott S,2012-09-17 22:28:00,203,That's the only way he could hold it for a quick pic. I made sure he was carefull. The fish swam away with no issues.
