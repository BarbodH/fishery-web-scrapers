730315,Handlebarz,2012-09-16 23:12:00,3790,Very nice ski gotta love them figure 8 strikes. I've heard it many places and times in different versions a musky is a musky no matter where your fishing keep at the 8's. I'm still trying to figure them out for trolling but I always cross the playner board lines.
730331,Pigeontroller,2012-09-16 23:33:00,2793,Solid fish Andrew!

730353,mike rousseau,2012-09-17 00:21:00,4661,Nice catch...  I fish clear water also... Really tough for figure 8s...  Usually my follows are 10 feet behind the lure as we as 10 feet under it... So you usually don't see them till it's too late...
