729001,Pikeslayer,2012-09-11 12:18:00,1443,We're out of scotch and stores are closed
729005,Pikeslayer,2012-09-11 12:37:00,1443," Nothing too dramatic Roy (except for being out of scotch). Pix will need to wait until I get home and download some video. Actually pretty calm right now, I think maybe the 'eye' is passing through??"
729006,Skipper D,2012-09-11 12:47:00,1970,Theres a time zone change between you and us is'nt there Simon .
729007,Roy,2012-09-11 12:48:00,13728,Nothing worse than running out of scotch at breakfast but I'm sure you can get used to screech easily enough.
729038,Toad Hunter,2012-09-11 15:27:00,261,"out of scotch and stores are closed ? arrrg, guess with Leslie around, a trip to St. Pierre is out of the question..."

Someone must have some shine hanging around  Where I'm from, if the store is closed, we knock on the door, and they let us in....any hour of the day or night!! Gotta love small towns full of good people!!  St. Johns is a little different. Too city like for me!!  S."

Coming from you Rob, that's huge  I figure at the end of the trip, Pergatory would be a fair deal Joey  Oh you know I will Frankie  Actually planning on some moose to keep the budget in check.   Cape Spear sunrise is at the top of the list. I've seen the sun set in Victoria so this will be cool."
