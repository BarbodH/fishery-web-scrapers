729469,OhioFisherman,2012-09-13 01:08:00,6623,"https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en  I spent 5 weeks in Largo in 2009, it seemed a nice area, I had no problems getting around. Ulmerton Road which runs off of I-75 will take you right to the gulf, it`s maybe a 20 minute drive depending on the time of day.  There is a road that runs along the gulf once you pass over the inland water way, there are places to eat all along it, I didn`t have a bad meal at any of them. There are also plenty of places to eat right on Ulmerton, but more of your typical fast food places.  The coastal road mentioned is the typical tourist area, restaurants, hotels, gift shops. I didn`t fish at all while I was there, no interest in Salt water fishing, and when I mentioned looking around at some of the fresh water lakes in the area I was told that any of them might have a gator. LOL since I can`t move faster than a turtle? I passed.  I drove down and stayed with an ex wife, so I can`t help you on airfare or hotels, although the area is loaded with hotels."
729537,Sandbag,2012-09-13 12:44:00,533,"Wiser...  For flights I would look at Allegiant airlines out of Niagara Falls NY airport.  I recently priced to Tampa for my family of three and it was going to be $399.00 for all three of us direct, taxes in to Tampa. That was in October as well.  I see you are in Niagara anyhow so to e that would be a no-brainer.  Cheers  Craig"
730204,chrismarkz,2012-09-16 16:07:00,20,"I've beengoing down to that area for the last 7 years, beautiful area. I was recommendedto charter with Captain Jim Huddleston; great guide beautiful boat and reallyknows his stuff. First time i went out with him we hit the coldest cold frontof the winter season. We fished for about 6 hours landing 10- 15 reds andtrout, not the best day on the water but still not the worst. Jim only chargedus for half the charter price. 3 days later, Jim called me up and told me thereds were on fire and told us to meet him on the dock at 7am for a day on thewater free of charge. we worked tailing reds for 6 hours and he still didn’twant to come in. this captain is a full time captain on the water 6 days aweek, a little pricier but well worth it. BTW if you find a cheap guide morethen likely you’ll be fishing on a weekend with all of the other weekendfisherman on all the well known spots with live bait. Full time captains followthe schools of drum and reds around on a daily basis. Jim Huddleston= class    I now bring my boat down there if need a few spots pm me and i could give you a few gps cords, around the pinallas point area <br style=""mso-special-character: line-break;""><br style=""mso-special-character: line-break;"">  Jim Huddleston 546 8th Street Palm Harbor, FL 34683 [email protected]"
730263,Fang,2012-09-16 21:11:00,1330,"Not sure if you're open to other options but you can fish really cheap in Cozumel. I did full day fly fishing for bonefish, a boat, guide and beers(and lunch) for 250 usd. Best months for fish are May and April. Lots of bonefish, permit show up in May as well as baby tarpon (up to 20 lbs). You can fly and spin fish all day and no winds in the spring. I'm working on a trip back there maybe this year but things are getting very busy for me, maybe 2014."
