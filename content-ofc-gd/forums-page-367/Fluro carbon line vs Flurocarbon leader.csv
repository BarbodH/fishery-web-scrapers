730307,davey buoy,2012-09-16 22:51:00,5505,There seems to be a slight difference in the two lines. Is one stiffer or firmer than the other?. Secondly if there is a difference which would you use as a leader on a pin/float set up?. From what I've read one comes in a smaller amount(leader)and the other in the hundreds of yards.(main).
730308,kickingfrog,2012-09-16 22:56:00,8333,"Floruo mainline is a compromise. It's limper so it doesn't coil as bad. I never use it. Leader floruo is stiffer, and more expensive."
730314,davey buoy,2012-09-16 23:03:00,5505," If you were going to add a 4 or 5' leader,say 6lb,what would you recommend?"
730317,Gregoire,2012-09-16 23:15:00,1397,"I have one spool on a reel spooled up with fluoro as a mainline. I would use this line only for fishing deep clear lakes. Otherwise I prefer braid with a fluro or mono leader. I like to tie the leader directly to the mainline. For musky fishing I use leader material line. For bass fishing I just use regular line. I really only think that having a fluoro leader only matters in clear water bodies, and fluoro mainline is only necessary for vertical presentations in 10-40 feet of water."
730319,BillM,2012-09-16 23:17:00,17367, Depends on the fishing...   Are we talking steelhead?
730323,davey buoy,2012-09-16 23:20:00,5505, Yes!
730326,BillM,2012-09-16 23:24:00,17367," I run a shot line and separate leader on my pins..  Say 3ft of shot line (Which is mono) and then 24-36inches (Depending on river and condition) of either 4-6lb Maxima Ultra-Green or 4-6lb Drennan Flouro..   The Drennan is pretty much rope, 4lb is more like 6-8lb, lol.     Running 5ft of flouro leader will get expensive after a while, it's definitely not needed (you also don't wanna be sliding shot up and down it either... it doesn't hold up as good as mono does for that).."
730328,davey buoy,2012-09-16 23:29:00,5505," Thanks,starting to get a better understanding of it's durability."
