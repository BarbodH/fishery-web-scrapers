729647,Aaron Shirley,2012-09-13 22:42:00,655,Drop shotting is deadly for walleye with the minnow baits.
729679,mercman,2012-09-14 00:57:00,7054,"  just keep a slight tension against the weight and your line will keep the bait off the bottom.Reel it in super slow, and vibrate the rod tip occasionally to impart some action on the bait."
729759,reelinrolly,2012-09-14 14:16:00,281,Well guys.  Thanks for all the advice I have a tournament tomorrow and I think I have a pretty good idea of how I'm gonna be fishing  Got all the gear organized last night!!!!

729845,Roy,2012-09-14 21:36:00,13728,Yeah and where's the OFC tournament sign???
729905,reelinrolly,2012-09-15 01:41:00,281,The ofc sign is in the boat along with the slammers lol.   Hopefully a few hogs will be in there tomorrow as well.  I'f any of you guys are near sarnia come check out the TBBA weigh in at mooretown launch at 330

728217,Rod Caster,2012-09-07 21:40:00,5784," Re: swammers. Agreed. Very versatile. Works great on a jig head for lakers, pike, walleye and bass.  I also mirror the sentiments about slammers on drop shot"
728243,moxie,2012-09-07 23:27:00,1566,"Slammers, Gulp Minnow and leech . Veritas, President xt, 10lb Crystal uni-ed to a Vanish lead and fish it at any angle at just about any depth."
728248,kickingfrog,2012-09-07 23:47:00,8333, I think I'm missing something. How does the hook stay in place so you can set the hook?
728320,singingdog,2012-09-08 11:15:00,1047,"Another vote for Slammers.  If you fish skirted grubs, save them after the rock bass tear the twister tails off. The body/skirt makes a great dropshot bait rigged with the skirt out like a small, solid bodied tube. Yamamoto sells them as ""Ikas"". A couple of my other favourites are Pro Senkos and Jacks worms (one of the best kept secrets for smallies).  On many of our lakes, a shakey head will catch fish head-to-head with a dropshot rig. It's much easier to rig, and much easier to fish. Occasionally the dropshot will catch more fish, but not that often. All the baits mentioned so far work for both presentations."
728667,BucktownAngler,2012-09-10 14:34:00,582,"was smashing them this weekend on dropshotted wacky rigged senkos. 4 & 5""  im no drop shot expert though...this is just what worked for me.     Anybody use a baitcast setup? im more comfortable with a baitcaster, not sure if it is ideal though for this technique"
728690,DaveMc,2012-09-10 16:21:00,89," nothing saying you cant, if thats what you are comfortable with then go for it. I am more comfortable with a spinning setup (7'2"" crucial MED dropshot rod and stradic 2500)"
728691,Christopheraaron,2012-09-10 16:25:00,3525, I got some at the sail in burlington.
728693,Live2fish85,2012-09-10 16:30:00,1633,Yea I personally like spinning rods for dropshot. I also use a Crucial right now with a Supreme XT.  My friend uses a Legend Extreme with the core and it works awesome to. So yea baitcasters will work.
728751,Stoty,2012-09-10 19:08:00,2910,"Spinning reels typically have a better/smoother drag system for dropshotting with such light line, that's why I prefer spinning over casting.  With that being said...My preference is my Big Bear 7'0 ML Dropshot rod with a Shimano Sustain spinning reel, but I always have a baitcasting setup rigged with a dropshot with a heavier weight/line setup in case there's some structure/cover that would require that little extra strength."
729023,reelinrolly,2012-09-11 14:07:00,281,Really started honing in on the smallies this week.  I won 120 on our work football pool. Looks like I'm buying a new rod
729070,LucG,2012-09-11 17:08:00,779,"Amazing info in this thread! Keep it coming!  My piece of advice is to try wacky rigging a 3"" senko on a dropshot rig. Shhhhhh"
729264,Cudz,2012-09-12 03:46:00,2652, LOL I am laughing because your drop shot setup is worth same amount of $ as my boat.
729269,hawk-eye,2012-09-12 05:56:00,141," It doesn't.  I find it feels like setting the hook with a 3 way swivel set up, feels kind of soft. Hook slides down and locks up against the weight. The time between the snap of the rod for the hook set and the hook sliding down to engage the sinker could only be measured by NASA. Just a nice sweeping hook set seems to do the trick.  Just something I've be experimenting with, thought Id throw it out there. Maybe someone else will try it and like it.  Remember...we're all in this together."
729377,hoops12,2012-09-12 18:16:00,127,  I agree 100%.  I was at the French this weekend and was killing it on this setup!

It is amazing to feel bites and the entire rod is just over 3oz. I use a Shift reel spooled up with 8lb castable Sufix fluorocarbon tied to a steelhead micro swivel. I then add 6lb fluoro as a leader or keep 8lb in later fall for big fish. I've been using size 1 Gammy drop shot hooks and wide gaps for drop shotting, although I recently got some of those VMC drop shot hooks with the built in swivel. This set-up has been pretty sweet to fish. I'll be using it real soon  Have fun drop shotting!"

727982,Stoty,2012-09-07 01:02:00,2910,10000000% use a flouro leader when dropshotting!
727993,Jigger,2012-09-07 01:34:00,1237,"Thx Stoty, figured that was the case. Ive been using straight mono with no ill effects but noticed that alot of the fish were just there. Certainly feel the biters, even in 25+fow, just not the mushy dead weight fish. Think this fall im gonna ramp up the line abit. Been using those Stringease hooks all summer. Theyre great! Problem with the slammers, and Senkos while we're at it, is that the fish love them too much. Almost have to put them in the monthly budget. They're that good."
727995,Stoty,2012-09-07 01:37:00,2910," I hear ya!!!! I've placed about 12 orders with Xzone this year! With at least another one coming to stock up for my upcoming events! Seriously... nothing I've used can even compare to Slammers. My wife even said ""wow these slammers work awesome"" over the weekend at Bon Echo!"
727999,Live2fish85,2012-09-07 01:45:00,1633,"I use Jackall Crosstail almost always when dropshotting. I do use slammers the odd time as well.  For hooks I love the VMC swivel hooks. Just make sure they have the single swivel, the double swivel ones I am not a fan of and if I have to get them I will cut the small swivel off."
728002,Live2fish85,2012-09-07 01:49:00,1633,"  I agree, I usually tie on a longer lead at the start of the day incase I get a break off. I hate tying on another leader while fishing is hot.  As for line I always use 6# fluoro."

728032,reelinrolly,2012-09-07 02:36:00,281,Lol. What have I started. Hah.  Thanks guys.  As always this place is a wealth of knowledge!!  I'm gonna be fishing in a river system (St. Clair Rivet).   Do any of you guys fish this type of water?
728057,hawk-eye,2012-09-07 04:16:00,141,"I mainly river fish and drop shot for smallies. Favorite bait has been gulp shiners 3"", and berkley realistic shiners 3"". Had great success with both. This year I started using the gulp 4"" crawler and they have been fantastic. Hard to say which I prefer. I like to use at least a 7' rod, nothing in particular, but if your budget fishing like me the standard 6'6"" will get you by. I find it a bit difficult when you get snagged up when drifting current brakes with a shorter rod. Defiantly floro leader though. I run 10lb power pro main line and 8lb floro lead. i try to keep 12"" of floro above the hook.  This year I started using a bit of float gear on the drop shot and its been working out pretty good. I will tie a small barrel swivel to the main line to take up the twist. Slide the the leader through the eye of the hook but don't tie it. I will then slide a small plastic bead, then a bobber stopper, then another plastic bead. Now its time for the pencil lead, or what ever weight you prefer. the bobber stopper allows for height adjustment without having to cut and retie. Every time you hook up the fish will pull the hook down to the lead, so after removing the fish just slide the bobber stopper and the hook back up to where you want it. This also allows the bait to move around a bit more. I've been in some situations where the current or wind was pushing around to much and the hook would be up at the swivel, in this case I added a bead and bobber stopper above the hook as well to hold it in place."
728061,uglyfish,2012-09-07 07:18:00,981," Ya think?! My wife would KILL me!! I know this, I've tried! Lol but yes, absolutely a killer combo!  I run 3 set ups, cause all I do is dropshot for smallies.  6'10 medium xtra fast g loomis GL2, 2500 stradic ci4 8lb trilene 100% flouro, size 1 or 1/0 trokar dropshot hook.  6'10 medium xtra fast backwoods custom rod, stradic ci4 8lb flouro, trokar hook  7'2 medium xtra fast shimano crucial, stradic  ci4, 8lb flouro trokar hooks.  Baits, god I have so many, but I typically use jackall crosstail shads, x zone slammers and shiver shads, powerteam lures jp hammer shads and finiky ticklers, and bassmagnet, twitch. All are awesome baits and have accounted for many fish, big fish and several tournament wins.  I don't run braid, no need for it. I don't use a swivel, no need and I don't like the extra knots, line twist is inevitable, but managable. Spool correctly, spray with reel magic, learn to back reel."

727870,Stoty,2012-09-06 20:10:00,2910," Dropshotting is a technique that has become extremely popular for bass (smallmouth in particular).  It has the weight below the hook so the weight stays in contact with the bottom and the bait is suspended up the line at whatever leader length you want. (typically 8""-24"" off bottom).
