Hooked into 3 low 30 inch musky but only landed one while casting inline spinners. Caught a smallie and then a 30"" pike while trolling, my first ever there. The pike in Balsam are eating very well. Super thick. The family and I enjoyed it for dinner today. The other two in the boat successfully picked on the perch all day. Thanks for the day out Adam. Sweet rig."

I agree with you they are eating well. My pike was mid 30's and solid. I have not turned into a fish-eater yet, but I will certainly extinguish any pike from Balsam."
