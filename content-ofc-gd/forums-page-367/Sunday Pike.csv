730253,Joey,2012-09-16 20:29:00,9122,Some nice pike there
730283,Skud,2012-09-16 22:11:00,739,Did you just troll for those jacks or still fish
730311,LefroyFisherman,2012-09-16 23:00:00,602,"I just drift with the wind and cast, making a few passes."
730341,Skud,2012-09-16 23:59:00,739,That is how I usually fish for them too. I have been on a dry spell for pike on Cook`s all this year. At least there is a steady supply of aggressive perch to continually entertain.
