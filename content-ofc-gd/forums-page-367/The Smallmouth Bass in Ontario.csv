729728,otter649,2012-09-14 04:36:00,118,Interesting list of the trophy sized sm bass caught & out of which lake or river (at the end of the report)....

729896,ehg,2012-09-15 01:20:00,2666,"Downloaded this and read about 3/4 so far. What an incredible amount of information. Smallmouth are a favourite to catch as they jump and fight good. A few things stood out.  -seems round gobies are first choice when different prey are available. -crayfish are near last choice, but compromise large part of diet due to easy opportunities. -Smallies prefer clear waters thus the rocks and subsequent crayfish.  -Largest 5 fish weight from tourney came from Lake Simcoe -2nd largest 5 fish tourney weight came from Lake St. Francis (St. Lawrence R.)  Still much to read, really enjoying this.  If something similar came out on walleye that'd be good."
729901,Steve,2012-09-15 01:27:00,2075,"interesting comments regarding fish for spawning bass.  many bass guys will argue until they are blue in the face that it is ""ok"" to fish for bass during the spawn...because you can in the states.  that document showed otherwise.  thanks for posting. made for a great read!"
729910,manitoubass2,2012-09-15 02:01:00,11391," I read live bait vs spinnerbaits.  I could see that, cause with spinnerbaits you get a perfect hook almost evertime (in my experience). Almost always right through the lip, whereas livebait is sometimes swallowed.  Anyhow, awesome post/read. Thanks for sharing!   "

730203,kickingfrog,2012-09-16 15:47:00,8333,Don't know how I missed this. Something to read.  My wife just gave me the look cause I was going to take the laptop upstairs.
730213,mike rousseau,2012-09-16 17:17:00,4661,2 things...  My pb would make page one...woot woot...lol... 7.5pb/3.4kg  And anybody else see the jan 1st pattern.....?
730228,ehg,2012-09-16 18:30:00,2666, The largest 5-fish tourney weights were both from 2010. Many of the largest fish measured were from tourneys in last decade and probably accurate. A lot of Molson Big Fish contest entries are uncontrolled and slightly suspect.   Those fish were mostly caught in summer but Molson Big Fish contest entries didn't specifically ask for date so they just put starting date of year(Jan 1st). Thus the Jan. 1st pattern. Otherwise they would be caught through ice out of season. lol  A 7.5 lb fish is a big one. St. Lawrence around Lake St Francis and Lake Simcoe are premier smallmouth spots in world.
