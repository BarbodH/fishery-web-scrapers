730356,Skud,2012-09-17 00:28:00,739,I bought a new tower from Hp and it came with a new keyboard that has all the extra blue characters that can be used for whatever. I cannot get this thing to give me the question mark or other regular keys that most would use. Can`t find any info online and it came with no instructions. If I can get no answer here this keyboard will assist me in my next target practice session involving my shotgun. Please help
730357,Terry,2012-09-17 00:38:00,14456,you could go to control panel to key board and change it to US keyboard..you might have to go to add to add US
730361,Joey,2012-09-17 00:44:00,9122,"Yup, Terry is right, I have an HP laptop and the keyboard is a pain the you know what.  Often times I'll hit the wrong key and it changes me from US to something else and I don't have the question mark or the @ sign anymore etc. and have to change it back to US."

730412,Skud,2012-09-17 03:30:00,739,A restart after changing the settings set it right. Thanks Terry and Joey

If you hold down ctrl+shift together your problem will come back because this is what probably what caused it in the first place.  When you have this problem (Ã©) just open note pad and try to type the question mark and this what you get a ? You will see you can type as usual in notepad but not when typing in your browser  Tom."
