729891,zvejnieks,2012-09-15 01:00:00,5,"Hi guys and gals, looking to upgrade (recently sold my FL8...).  Looking at either an FL-12 with the tri-beam transducer or FL-18 with the single beam transducer.  Mostly fish Simcoe..from shallow perch to deep trout.  Any advice would be much appreciated."
729893,buick14,2012-09-15 01:07:00,741,Fl 20 tri beam
729898,strik,2012-09-15 01:22:00,175,def the fl 18  but would try to upgrade to the  tri beam    good luck
729907,Bondar,2012-09-15 01:42:00,817,Without a doubt the Fl-12 
729913,buick14,2012-09-15 02:26:00,741,"Fl-20 pro/super pack tri beam.  If you use in boat, fl-18 bottom lock.  Lx-5 marcum unit you can lock ducer in any part of water column.  I hope this won't be a marcum vs vex debate"

729950,mike rousseau,2012-09-15 11:31:00,4661,Do you have a boat with sonar capable of using a portable pack and ice ducer?  I sold my vex and use my humminbird 597ci hd di on the ice and love it....
729958,zvejnieks,2012-09-15 12:40:00,5," I have a 14' aluminum boat and have been using a Garmin GPSMap/Fishfinder.  I'm not sure if I was really going to use the Vex in my boat.  Given the Vex's capabilities, maybe I should start using it (generally I mostly troll), but don't want to limit my possibilities and regret my purchase."
729959,mike rousseau,2012-09-15 12:46:00,4661,  what i meant was...  is there a portable ice kit for your garmin? so you can use it instead of buying a vexilar...  my humminbird was capable of being portable and use an ice ducer.... so i sold my vexilar to buy the portable pack and ice ducer...  now i have sonar... flasher... and gps while ice fishing.... and all my waypoints from open water season to hit during ice season... and i only have to know the settings for one unit...  no regrets
729972,zvejnieks,2012-09-15 13:47:00,5,I see what you mean... My Garmin doesn't come with that option...and I am happy with it.  The Vex would really be more for ice fishing. There's a lot to consider...too much to think about...I should just go fishing. Thanks

730417,Joeytier,2012-09-17 03:50:00,3990,"I have an FL-12, and I definitely love it (have no problem getting a read in any depth), but sometimes I miss not having a zoom feature."
