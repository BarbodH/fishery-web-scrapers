729903,skinny,2012-09-15 01:33:00,442,ok found a bag of trout in freezer this is from the spring and I froze it in water. looking for pointers on how to handle it and smoke it  should I let it defrost then brine it and smoke or should I go about it in some other way
729912,kuhaman,2012-09-15 02:13:00,503,Smoked some salmon the other night that I pulled from the freezer. Thawed the fillets and then brined them for about 12 hours. Pulled em out of the brine and let them dry and smoked with some cherry wood. It was awesome!!
729952,GBW,2012-09-15 12:08:00,8460,I would put them in the brine to thaw for 12 to 24 hours.  then use black cherry & apple wood and you are good to go!
729970,Billy Bob,2012-09-15 13:45:00,5865,I almost always freeze my fish for a later date to smoke.......  Defrost fish on counter or even just put it in the brine if you want to smoke it the next day....but then leave it in the  brine on the counter to defrost for a few hours then place it in the frig overnight....  Here's the best and easiest brine I have found........  1 gallon of water 1/4 cup of Kosher Salt 1 cup of brown sugar (This can be adjusted for a smaller or larger amount of fish)  Mix well and place the fish in brine to soak until the next day when your ready to smoke.....then take fish out of the brine and a VERY QUICK rinse with cold water.....now place on paper towels and more paper towels on the top of the fish and dab the fillets/fish dry....smoke until done.......usually 3-5 hours for me.
729979,dave524,2012-09-15 14:06:00,4508,I read somewhere it is actually better to use a previously frozen fish as the freezing breaks down the cell walls and you get better penetration of the brine/marinade into the meat.
729983,kuhaman,2012-09-15 14:25:00,503,"I never rinse my fish after brining, I put them on a rack, dab them with paper towels and then let them dry until the pellicle forms. The pellicle gives the smoke something to stick to. IMO it's the most important step when smoking fish"
729989,ch312,2012-09-15 15:28:00,1590, allowing the pellicle to form is important for both flavor and preventing fat/juice from oozing out of the fish while smoking. the fillet will look and taste better this way
729994,Billy Bob,2012-09-15 16:08:00,5865,"It still forms each time I smoke fish......depending on what kind of fish you use, some have a LOT of slime after brining overnight...Especially any kind of pike/chain pickerel....Eh..."
730003,GBW,2012-09-15 17:57:00,8460,I never rinse or pat dry the fish after being in the brine.  I put it on moist and let it smoke.
730032,Billy Bob,2012-09-15 22:31:00,5865, That's nice..........
