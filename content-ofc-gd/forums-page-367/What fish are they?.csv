728029,dbick,2012-09-07 02:33:00,18,"Hi all! Just got back from a fishing trip in the temagami area, great trip with phenomenal weather!! A buddy and I hiked to a lake on day and brought the fishfinder with us  and we putted around the lake marking fish, a lot were on the bottom and some were suspended. This lake was a bout 2km long and about 500m wide, in general, with depths in the main lake area 40 feet to 25 feet. We have only caught Bass and Pike here but have mostly only fished for bass. Here's my question: We saw quite a few fish on the bottom or suspended in the deeper water and wondering if anyone can take an educated guess as to what they are?! (because we never caught any of them and want to!)  Thanks! Dan"
728030,ttahhan,2012-09-07 02:35:00,191,"Hey Dan, sounds like perhaps Lake trout ?"
728031,Stoty,2012-09-07 02:35:00,2910,Judging by the depth.....I'm guessing they were wolf packs of Smallies. I was catching Smallies over the weekend in the 30-35ft depth.
728034,Stoty,2012-09-07 02:36:00,2910,I'm not a laker fisherman by any means... but aren't lakers are typically MUCH deeper this time of the year? 80+ feet
728044,Stoty,2012-09-07 02:58:00,2910,Would a lake that shallow be cold enough to support Lakers?
728048,Garfisher,2012-09-07 03:06:00,229,"Considering this is up near Temagami, I would think it is very possible for them to be in water of that depth at that latitude"
728051,Musky or Specks,2012-09-07 04:02:00,2710,Im guessing whitefish or ciscos
728083,Rich,2012-09-07 11:02:00,3927,Perch?
728090,Rod Caster,2012-09-07 11:44:00,5784,"I'm going with whitefish. If they were big fish, probably pike or walleye. Pretty small lake your talking about, not likely to hold Lakers at only 40fow.  On the lake I've been recently fishing, aprroximately the same size and depth, it holds pike, walleye and whitefish. We've trolled across the main basin a few times with no luck... Sounds a bit like your situation, and I'm guessing that my whitefish would be found in the main basin with pike cruising around them."
728115,dbick,2012-09-07 12:59:00,18,"its all very interesting. I'm thinking walleye or whitefish, but would be happy if its Lake trout! Thanks, will try to find out for sure next year and catch a bunch!"
728116,Fish Farmer,2012-09-07 13:01:00,2234,"Just a guess, Bluegill, Sunfish, Crappie. They are notorious for suspending in a shallow lake."
728127,ecmilley,2012-09-07 13:43:00,2163,"could be a lake stocked with splake, i would think it could be whitefish as well or as mentioned big smallies possibly ciscoes phone the mnr and ask"
728132,BillM,2012-09-07 13:59:00,17367,Herring/Cisco.
728134,jimmer,2012-09-07 14:07:00,2730,I'll definitely go with Stoty on this one. Smallies. I have caught many smallies in the smaller lakes in up to 50 fow. Try drop shotting with an extremely slow presentation the next time you are there.
728181,Joeytier,2012-09-07 17:47:00,3990,Could be either whitefish/herring or big smallies.  Water is very warm right now up there.
728569,dbick,2012-09-09 22:26:00,18,"I will try some slow drop-shotting next time..., but if its whitefish how would you catch them?"
728570,BillM,2012-09-09 22:34:00,17367,"Fish them just like you would through the ice..  tube jigs, ice jigs, live minnows, etc."
728616,Cudz,2012-09-10 02:16:00,2652,perch.  I remember fishing over 90' of water and marking tons of fish at 50'.  I decided to try the 50' depth and found them to be schools of perch.
730042,Billy Bob,2012-09-15 22:56:00,5865,CARP.........heard there is a lot of them in that area...........
730043,dbick,2012-09-15 23:01:00,18,"I thought maybe, so I'm gonna go ice fishing for carp there. Wanna come? Meet me there in February with your tips."
730044,Billy Bob,2012-09-15 23:06:00,5865,Sounds good but I'm busy hunting at that time of the year...
730369,chrismarkz,2012-09-17 01:06:00,20,"i just fished la reserve beauchene and was marking a ton of fish on bottom and suspended up to 30 off bottom. I made about 4 passes because i thought they were lakers or walleye, untill i snaged a soild 6 pound whitefish. found that if i seen 3-6 fished stacked up they were whities if larger schools they were smaller eyes."
