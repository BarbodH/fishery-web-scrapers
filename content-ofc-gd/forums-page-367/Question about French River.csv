729600,WeedLine,2012-09-13 18:17:00,322,"Hey guys, I'm going up to the French in a couple of weeks with some buddies. We're staying at Castaway Resort. I havn't fished the French in years and when i did, we stayed at Bear's Den Lodge. Does anyone know how the fishing is around Castaway? Any weeds or vegatation around there? I was hoping to fish mostly for bass but wanted to know if I should concentrate on pike and muskies in this area. Any info would be helpful. Thanks"
729614,bigcreekdad,2012-09-13 19:13:00,546,Not familiar with that lodge. Where is it?
729626,WeedLine,2012-09-13 20:28:00,322,It's on Dry Pine Bay Rd. I think it's on the lower French
729755,hoops12,2012-09-14 13:52:00,127,just got back from the Upper French...all bass no walters or skie's.
729881,Luke V.,2012-09-15 00:34:00,286,Im on the upper French right now till Sunday. Bass are biting the Walters are avoiding but that will change tomorrow
729933,chris.brock,2012-09-15 04:45:00,4053,"Dry Pine Bay is just east of 69, it's a pretty busy section of river, could be tough for walters"
729936,zamboniwaterboy,2012-09-15 05:28:00,126,"Hello If you are staying at Castaway ask Willy nicely for info and follow what he says!  Mr. Hass, fellow that sells bait just west of Loons, is very knowledgeable too.  The bay just east of Castaway holds walleye, the shores are loaded with pike and bass.   3 weeks ago silver surface lures fished over 10-14' of water worked very well.  Stand bye lure is a Mepps Black Fury #5 with yellow dots, get it down into the 8-10' foot mark.   Anchor the off the dock at Meshaw Falls, between the point and the telephone pool, drift a wporm on a Lindy rid, a minnow on a white or chart jig head, drop shotting works well to.   Go to Stoney Rapids set up in the north back eddy in about 13' of water and do the same as above.  Both ares produce bass, walleye, pike, musky, and catfish.  Musky can be found around the rocks, 3 sisters, just east of Castaway, the rock islands past Canoe Pass, the entrance to Horseshoe Bay.  The spots are numerous. Take a spare prop! Take gas cans and fill up in Alban or Noelville, the French River Supply post is a little more expensive but is convenient. There are soo many places to fish! White, black, silver and chart are good colours! Good luck!  NOTE!  DO NOT GO THROUGH CANOE PASS, the water is low and you will find the bottom.  If heading up river go around Four Mile Island.

729973,Billy Bob,2012-09-15 13:50:00,5865,"I have fished Dry Pine Bay several time out of Sand Beach Lodge.....couple of good spots for walleye and pike are Deer Bay and Eagle Nest....also not to far from the lodge.....a small bay just to the left of the lodge if you just left their dock......several drifts in that area has always produced walleyes, pike and the occasional catfish."
