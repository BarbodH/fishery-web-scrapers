730120,Cudz,2012-09-16 02:25:00,2652,Got out for a few hours this morning and managed 3 lakers and herring. Jaydub with big fish of the day at 9.7 pounds.  Nice fish.  Mine went 7.8 and his second was 5.7 pounds. Nice morning out on the lake.  I haven't seen it so flat out there in a long time.

730176,Cudz,2012-09-16 11:37:00,2652,"riggers.  I have them on my boat, I just hide them under the back seat. The best part is that I decided to run a Strike king KVD 2.5 square bill crankbait in sexy shad colour on one rod and it actually caught Jon's second laker. lol, i love those lures"
