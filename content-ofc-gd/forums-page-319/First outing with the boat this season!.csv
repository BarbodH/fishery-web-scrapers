776346,Luke V.,2013-03-30 03:28:00,286,Got the boat all shinned up and did all my spring maintenance over the last few days Looking good as new   Did a few new mods      And hit the water today Original plan was to hit Lake Erie for perch. But with the launch still a mess and the winds not looking in our favor decided to stick with the lower river. Launched the boat at 1230 was off at 530  First fish in my boat this season was a sucker    My bro was up next with a really nice Brown!!      That's all the fish that we caught But had a blast!! Excellent weather over the past few days here is Southern Ontario!  Tight lines Luke
