I must say not having to get up first thing this morning to get ready for work was a awkward feeling, I` am guessing that the job market for a 56 year old who has only done one thing( sales) for one company would be a tad slim. I am gonna take my time and enjoy this summer lots of time at my trailer and fishing and maybe see if I still have some semblence of a golf swing.  "

776921,Big Cliff,2013-04-01 20:02:00,6899,"I'm 67 and have no trouble finding work in sales (or related fields) so don't let the fact that you are 56 stop you! There is plenty of work out there if you want it!  Take a bit of time, catch your breath, then when you are ready to go back to work put those sales skills to work and go sell yourself, you'll do fine. If you want some job leads let me know, I know plenty of companies looking for a good mature sales rep.. Attitudes have changed a lot in the last ten years, many companies are realizing the value in the experience, work ethic, and reliability that older workers bring to the table. There are also a lot of other options available to you if you are interested. TIOW, SEB, I can and would be very willing to help you with any of that if you would like."
776946,lookinforwalleye,2013-04-01 21:32:00,4399,"Thanks Cliff,  I will look into the programs that are available  I will definately need some guidance as I have never made a resume and have not even thought about this sort of thing since 1977!!!! In the meantime I plan on spending the summer at my trailer on Dalrymple and as ATV said taking some  me time perhaps 3-4 months worth! I think I deserve that!"
