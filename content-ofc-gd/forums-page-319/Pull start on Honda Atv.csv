776389,mikdor,2013-03-30 14:16:00,109,I bought a 2007 Rancher 420 Honda and it does not have a manual pull start does anyone know how difficult it is to put on and how costly it would be. Thanks Mike
776572,Big Cliff,2013-03-31 11:13:00,6899,Do you mean that someone removed it? Electric/Pull start was standard on them.  Where are you located?
776575,Fish Farmer,2013-03-31 11:51:00,2234,"Don't know if this helps, I have a 2000 Fourtrac 350 and the pull start is hidden behind a plastic panel,"
776585,porkpie,2013-03-31 12:48:00,2521,"I think Honda stopped putting a pull start on their machines in the last few years.  One reason I'm looking at other bikes for my new one.  However I think it has something to do with EFI, so it may not make a difference?"
776612,mcdougy,2013-03-31 14:23:00,274,"It was always and still is an option on Honda bikes. Not too many dealers order them in without it, but you will find some that did not have them installed. Your bike may be one of the few. They go on the right side behind the removable lower plastic  body panel. You can buy one from Honda for about $200. An invaluable accessory in my mind if riding alone and far from the house. If you treat your bike like a submarine, this a spot for water access, you will have to seal it up.  Even if you aren't into the snorkel type riding, which I don't recommend, they are a good thing to give a try every so often,or you may have a rusted,broken, broken recoil or rotted rope at the time you need it. As sealing them is kinda difficult. Mines not sealed,as I don,t ride water unless forced.   Cheers"
776614,mcdougy,2013-03-31 14:27:00,274,"Pork pie, I'm thinking you can still get one put on a new machine. There  is aftermarket kits for some bikes also. A buddy of mine just put one on his PooPoo 2up. You may be onto something about Efi, I'm not sure on that ,another reason not too interested in it. Solid axle, foot shift, carb, with Power steering would be a sweet setup imo"
776631,mikdor,2013-03-31 15:51:00,109,Thanks for the help guys. Someone on another site said that if it is an American bike it does not come with a pull cord and I believe it is American because the odometer is in miles only. I am going to buy a pull cord and install it as it is a  GOOD INVESTMENT and will make me feel a whole lot better 50 miles from nowhere. Thanks Again P.S. For your information Cliff I am in South River.
776662,Big Cliff,2013-03-31 17:43:00,6899,"A little far for me to come and help you with it I'm afraid but it shouldn't be too hard to install. Good idea to put one on it though, I have only had to use mine a couple of times but it sure is handy when you need it."
