777020,DRIFTER_016,2013-04-02 01:35:00,10439,Got out today for a little fishin'. Weather was typically horrible for this time of year in YK. Fishing was slow and the bites were very light but I did manage to get tomorrow's dinner.  The one downer on the day was that when we got to the lake and I hauled the auger out of the sled I found that the bottom gear case cover on my auger was broken. I had to leave my toboggan and my buddy behind while I ran the 25 or 30 kms back to the house to get my backup powerhead. Now I need to search ebay for a replacement gear case cover or gear case.
