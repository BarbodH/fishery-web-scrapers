776689,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-31 19:53:00,8243,"Welcome aboard, now I'm not the rookie here. I think you will find your time here special, especially if you have been a member of other forums. It can at times seem like a koombuya love in but that's better than all out internet rage. Which can be entertaining as well....... but thankfully not here."
