777173,captpierre,2013-04-02 18:13:00,2521,Are the bass going to be off their nests by opener this spring?
777177,jedimaster,2013-04-02 18:19:00,3472,That's an interesting question given the late thaw we are going to have. As I recall they were long off there beds in 2011 and we had a late thaw that year as well.
777178,beagle dad,2013-04-02 18:23:00,224,daylight hrs big factor in bass nesting  pretty sure you'll not find them nesting fish have been known to spawn under the ice
777179,ecmilley,2013-04-02 18:30:00,2163,"doubt it most of bass done begininng of june, see the odd nest but have seen bass on odd beds end of july"
777181,Christopheraaron,2013-04-02 18:42:00,3525,"Interesting timing, but I don't think it will affect them, I have yet to see a nest after may lol"
777182,kickingfrog,2013-04-02 18:44:00,8333,"March weather doesn't matter much. April, May does matter."
777243,EC1,2013-04-02 21:00:00,930,"When bass opener comes around, the fish may be off the nests, but what about them guarding fry? If you don't want to hurt fish, it might be time to quit fishing Bass seem to be thriving, as always, the smarter ones live longer and get bigger, and the dumb ones get killed or eaten.  Nowadays, i worry more about practicing proper catch and release, and not just putting a fish back in water and having it die off, just not in front of your face"
777265,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-02 21:50:00,8243,"The smallest nest as close as 15 feet from my beach, have seen them there a week after opening when we had a mild winter and gone 2 weeks before opening after a long winter. Unpredictable. And Christopher, your too young to have seen anything. Yes, that's a laugh out loud comment."
777276,BillM,2013-04-02 22:47:00,17367,"I'm catching way too many of the stupid things when pike opener hits, on the weed edges.  I wouldn't worry too much about them being on the beds for opener."
777303,Jigger,2013-04-03 01:00:00,1237,Totally agree with this statement.
777309,MCTFisher9120,2013-04-03 01:16:00,3761,  This just makes me want to yell so loud  73 Days and counting
