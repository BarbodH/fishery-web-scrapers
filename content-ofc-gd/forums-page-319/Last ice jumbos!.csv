776582,davey buoy,2013-03-31 12:27:00,5505,"There a few nice hogs Steve!!!!!!!!!!!! WTG!! How was the shoreline where you got on?,saw some iffy ones the last couple of days."
776588,steverowbotham,2013-03-31 13:03:00,1800,"Shoreline ice was sketchy at best on the way out, but on the way back in, we walked the last 50 feet on floater chunks, so it was my last day out for sure."
776598,moxie,2013-03-31 13:41:00,1566,Way to pinch a few Steve. Glad to hear she's finally breaking up.
776638,pidge,2013-03-31 16:17:00,438,Jeeze man some really nice ones you got there thanks for sharing.
776641,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-31 16:35:00,8243,Those slabs are ridiculous. Good on you.  Happy Easter all.
776647,Woodsman,2013-03-31 16:55:00,1286,"Judging by your hands they look like decent perch. When you hold the fish out so much closer to the camera than your body it distorts the size of the fish, but I bet you already know this."
776711,grizzlybri,2013-03-31 23:29:00,565,"way to go, those are some great looking jumbos."
776716,BillM,2013-03-31 23:43:00,17367,Sweet!  Now lets hurry up with the ice out so I can chase after some crappie.
