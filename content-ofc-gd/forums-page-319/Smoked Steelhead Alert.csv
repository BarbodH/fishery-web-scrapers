776710,ChrisK,2013-03-31 23:23:00,2772,Easter long weekend is my official trailer opener with a traditional batch of smoked steelhead.  This year I played around with a new marinade recipe that's been evolving over the years. When in doubt add more brown sugar and maple syrup and most of all don't scrimp on the Jack Daniels. Drooling is optional......   Cheers !
776721,FloatnFly,2013-03-31 23:57:00,1640,looks good
776727,irishfield,2013-04-01 00:13:00,26272,  Do you drink that while waiting for the fish to smoke  or is part of the marinade?
776732,dhickey,2013-04-01 00:56:00,1038,  Try the Crown Royal maple finished.. OMG
776734,ChrisK,2013-04-01 01:08:00,2772,I have a bottle but couldn't bring myself to using it. Its just that good
776735,ChrisK,2013-04-01 01:13:00,2772,Actually I was washing down some Hieneken during the process.  They actually make JD wood chips for smokers. Saw them at Canadian Tire the other day while I was picking up my apple and cherry
776757,gaspumper,2013-04-01 02:31:00,393,Care to share the recipe?
776760,Roy,2013-04-01 02:46:00,13728,Lookin' good Chris! YUMMMMM
776763,dhickey,2013-04-01 02:50:00,1038,I put it on a rib roast. Doesnt take much.  You wont regret it
776766,ChrisK,2013-04-01 02:57:00,2772,"1/4 cup non iodized salt 2 cups apple juice 2 cups soy sauce maple syrup to taste 1/3 cup brown sugar or more to taste whiskey to taste 1/2 tsp union powder 1/2 tsp garlic powder 1/2 tsp pepper 1/2 tsp tabasco sauce or more to taste  A lot of these ingredients I've been adding until it tastes right especially the stuff like tabasco,whiskey,brown sugar and maple syrup. Just don't add to much salt.......you can never have enough garlic or onion powder but start with the recipe and add more to taste..."
776767,ChrisK,2013-04-01 02:59:00,2772,"OK,I'll give it a go next time."
