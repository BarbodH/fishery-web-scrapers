776303,Rich,2013-03-29 20:36:00,3927,"I'd say this was a 'Good Friday'! The carp were active, even surface feeding and splashing in some spots. Bites were tough as the water was crystal clear, but a lotta chum and a lotta patience, me and the GF were able to land a couple. Good day out, dunkin corn in the backyard.    "

776309,Locnar,2013-03-29 21:33:00,645,Right on man!   What did ya catch em on? Every time I go fishin' for carps they elude me. They'll be all around the bait... but no takers. Any tips?
776314,Rich,2013-03-29 22:25:00,3927,"Hook/corn on the bottom, and a few cans of sweet sweet chum does the ticket for me!  If you'd ever like to tag along in the spring I'd gladly show you how I do it. I'm not so advanced but I catch a lot of fish, and some real good ones when they run the erie tribs, in about a month !"
776616,Mike Pike,2013-03-31 14:43:00,1332,Beauty backyard you got there Rich.  And a good job by both of ya to catch those beasties at this time of year.  Nice pics and thanks for sharing you day with us.
