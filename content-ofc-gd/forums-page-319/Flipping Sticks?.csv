774960,RJackson,2013-03-21 14:03:00,113,"I used the 7'11"" Shimano Crucial Heavy action last year.  Real light, yet powerful stick.  I'd say if you were to lower your budget on rod or reel on your combo I'd say the reel for sure.  Having a nice light rod for all day flipping will make for a more ""Easy on the body"" day!  RJ"

775089,Deeds,2013-03-22 00:05:00,14,"I'm thankful for all the input guys, cheers. I'd like a stick between 7'6 and 7'11. I just want a little more versatility out there when I run into slop mats, I don't want to lose anything because I'm not geared up properly. I've been checking out some deals online and the one on here ^^ looks pretty good too. Thanks again, let y'all know when I grab something."
775147,MCTFisher9120,2013-03-22 12:24:00,3761,"When I first got into bass fishing real good some of the first ""high end"" rods I bought were for flipping/pitching and frogging. Simply because the rod's for the job needed to be powerful, sensitive, light in hand, and warranty covered. I can deal with a cheap casting rod and can fish it all day with little fatigue but give me a cheap flipping stick and the amount of extra rod weight sucks. Your swinging light to 1oz baits constantly all day long looking for a a handful of bites a light balanced setup is needed for this so try and get the best you can afford.  I started with a pair of St Croix Legend Tournament rods a 7'3XH and a 7'H(1 blew apart the other is long gone) Seemed light to me paired with Curado 200E7's caught lot's of fish and learned the basics of  pitching and punching through cover with plastics and jigs. But then I went over to what G.Loomis has to offer. The difference in balance was huge. I didn't realize how ""tip-heavy"" the St Croix's were and when your rod is pointed to the sky most of the day you want the weight in your wrist not at the top of the rod, tip down applications like twitchbaits, spinnerbaits, jerks or canks the balance of the rod is not as important due to the rod being pointed down 80% of the time.  I purchased a BCFR893 Mossyback, it's a 7'5"" Medium Heavy powered rod excellent for all around pitching. Balances really nice with a sub 7oz reel like the Core 100MgFV, or 50Mg7's. This rod gave me a taste of what a expensive flipping stick is all about, balance, power, amazing sensitivity and backed by a awesome warranty. I'm a tackle nut so I upgrade to the BCFR894 GLX (sub $500) at 7'5"" and Hvy power this is one of my go-to stick's in the cover and don't think I will try anything else for the heavy cover flipping/punching. The price is a few hundred but you quickly forget about it when you feel the sensitivity balance and power all working together.  Your looking for a stout rod that your chasing big fish with buy a quality stick you will not be disappointed. Lot's of great options out there!"
775157,musky_hunter,2013-03-22 13:10:00,328,Balance is the key to a nice stick. I'd take a $250 stick that is balanced versus a $500 that was light and tip heavy.

775259,kickingfrog,2013-03-23 00:48:00,8333,FWIW? This week's Beyond the Cast with JP DeRose this week tested 4 flippin' sticks with MSRPs of $184-$200.  Duckett White Ice G. Loomis GL2 Okuma Helios Shimano Cumara   Using their tests they concluded that there was a trade-off between the rods tested. The 2 rods that had the best balance and accuracy rated lower in the power and sensitivity categories. Durability was not tested and warranties were not mentioned.

775351,landry,2013-03-24 02:02:00,1005,"as most said, you can find a nice light and sensitive stick for around a 100. With braid and 20' of line out I felt the bites on my old cheap basspro im6 just fine. My current low $100 quantum is lighter and comfortable and nicer. A glx is overkill IMO for this application."
775570,Deeds,2013-03-25 20:00:00,14,"Yup, I picked up this combo. For the money and for my first flippin' stick, I think I scored a nice deal. Thanks to you all again for the input. Chance, the seller, cheers bud. Nice doing business with you, can't wait to get out and pitch for some lunkers!"
776758,Mike_D,2013-04-01 02:38:00,5,Hey  In the $100 to $150 price range I'd look for a Abu Veritas 7'6' MH for $100 (and can be found for less) or the new Fenwick Aetos 7'6' H rod which Sail sells for $149. Sail occasionally has pretty good promos as well. A couple of weeks ago all their regular priced rods were 20% off.  Mike D
774587,Deeds,2013-03-19 19:24:00,14,"I was looking into picking up a flipping stick this year, but was turned off when I saw that the prices of the specialized rod was going for about $260. I looked at Shimano, GLoomis, Okuma, Daiwa etc. Is there a cheaper alternative that can still have durability for those slop mats when trying to find bass? I was hoping to keep the price in or around $100-150. All help is appreciated. Thanks."
774592,ecmilley,2013-03-19 19:47:00,2163,"i went through this many times and your gonna get all kinds of advice. My advice spend the 260 get a st.croix legend tournament strong sensitive and very light can pitch it all day, only thing that comes close is a nrx without the pricetag"
774594,Luke V.,2013-03-19 20:40:00,286,"For that price look at Powell, Simax, Abu, and keep your eyes on the classifieds. Nothing wrong with saving some money on a gently used rod"
774595,lookinforwalleye,2013-03-19 20:40:00,4399,Try the st.Croix mojo series decent rod for the money and in your price range. Also take a look at Shimano Compre good rod for the money
774598,Ainsley,2013-03-19 20:48:00,142,I picked up a dobyns champion 765 flipping stick for 150 off the classifieds at the end of last season. Haven't had a chance to use it but I have been happy with all my dobyns rods so far.  Something to look at.

774631,kickingfrog,2013-03-19 23:19:00,8333,"More money doesn't necessarily mean more durable. Usually more expensive rods mean: Lighter, better components and maybe better build quality. I'm not interested in spending big money on a flipin' stick, so that low $100s range would be my max, and then throw more money at the reel."

774695,Snidley,2013-03-20 03:07:00,620,"I bought that 7'2"" Simax from Edwin. It is a super light weight stick, lighter than my 7'9"" Fenwick Techna flipper(not that surprising given the length difference). I have not fished it yet but the build quality is impeccable and I feel confident that the Simax will hoist them out of the ding weeds no problem (or I can just spear the fish with it, it's STOUT). They have a nice weight balancing kit on them (like the Johnny Morris BPS rods) to get the balance perfect too. I think they can be recomended especially at their price point of about $180 retail."

774772,Harrison,2013-03-20 16:24:00,2202," I agree Rob.  Except on the reel. Before and during the days of the ""super free"" reels money was well spent on a flip/pitch reel.  However, nowadays (a decade later +) you do not have to spend near as much to get the same or very similar functionality. Of course just my opinion.  For $200 bucks you can be well set up with a flip/pitch combo.  Your money is much better spent on high quality spinning rods and reels.  As always though, to each their own."
774773,ah_long,2013-03-20 16:26:00,354, but chances are any rods $150 and up will give you a generous lifetime warranty.

774861,Bassaholic,2013-03-20 22:18:00,74,"Don't see the point in a more expensive reel with a ""short line"" application like flippin', drags gonna be locked down and you'll probably be using big weights so casting abilities not an issue. Would rather spend the extra $ on a good quality stick that can handle the strain of flipping with big weights and hauling bass out of the slop and if you do it'll probably come with a good warranty. Buy a cheap one for something like this and it'll probably let you down sometime...be a shame if it was with a 5lbs bucket on the line.   "
774873,kickingfrog,2013-03-20 23:11:00,8333,"""More"" money on the reel didn't necessarily mean more than the rod or a mid to high end baitcaster. More often then not, an inexpensive baitcaster will let you down before a rod does. And some mentioned saving fractions of an ounce on a better rod, all those savings and a few more ounces would be found on a low end reel.  Quality is quality but more money on a rod doesn't mean more durable just on the face of it and not all the higher end rods have unlimited, lifetime warranties. It's actually very inexpensive to make a durable, almost indestructible rod (we all know the brands).  I use some pretty good equipment now and still have most of my tackle when I didn't spend nearly as much and I've never broken anything, ever (just jinxed myself now, I know). If someone is the type that is prone to breaking things then a solid unlimited warranty would be something to consider."
774902,esoxansteel,2013-03-21 01:18:00,1307,"200 bucks should get you a decent combo, regardless, check the classifieds, if your using braid sensitivity is a non-issue, as you will detect the slightest tap with the no stretch braid when you only 20 feet out. A Flippin stick is one rod i wouldnt break the bank over, just make sure it has the backbone to haul them out of the heavy stuff. Bass wont like you any better cause you spent 300.00 on a Flippin stick, instead of 100.00."

774954,Harrison,2013-03-21 13:50:00,2202," A lot of guys use pool cues! lol  I knew a couple guys who used those old INLINE rods. They doubled as push poles.  I used to use a pool cue, not literally, but a 7' old crucial with 5"" cut off the top.  Now as I get a ""bit"" older, I wish hadn't of used such heavy rods with no stretch braid.  My wrist is done now.  One hard hookset and I am in pain for the rest of the day.  Some of my buds who used the same heavy rods over the years have severe arm pain as well.  I now use a 7ft, MH and haul them out just fine. Hindsight, 20/20."
