776520,Ron,2013-03-31 01:06:00,1683,This guy impales himself not once but 4 times to show to remove fish hooks with various techniques.  Hope I never have to use any of them.  
776540,knightfisher,2013-03-31 02:30:00,237,"This guy is nuts. With all the videos on Utube of actual real life hook removals while on the water, why would anyone do something so crazy. Takes all kinds I guess.  Be good at a bar for a few free drinks I guess."
776542,danc,2013-03-31 02:35:00,4677,Not even gonna watch it.
776544,rob v,2013-03-31 02:57:00,535,what the he** is that ? I couldn't get past him trying to stab that thing into his arm ..... and having a hard time doing it !!
776545,tb4me,2013-03-31 03:09:00,3295,Wow that made my toes curl..Yikes
776548,irishfield,2013-03-31 03:15:00,26272,Clive didn't make the video... did he... lol.. not gonna watch it.
776550,Joey,2013-03-31 03:28:00,9122,"Meh, it wasn't that bad.  More painful watching him trying to get it through the skin than anything else.  Should have sharpened the hooks first I think!"
776552,danc,2013-03-31 03:34:00,4677,Just fish barbless like I do and you won't have to know any of these techniques anyways. Wayyy easier.
776577,fishindevil,2013-03-31 12:00:00,6254,"Holy crap !!!! what the hell ..... He's crazy,and yes I have removed my fair share from my hands and other people's hands !!!!! Mostly back when we ran the charter boat on Lake Ontario had a few customers impale themselves as well as myself more than once !!!!!!!!"
776601,moxie,2013-03-31 13:47:00,1566,X2. Been there done that but never on purpose.
776656,pike slayer,2013-03-31 17:27:00,1177,i didnt watch the video but a few years ago i was out fishing with a buddy and he messed up casting and i got a hook in my ear. i finished pushing it through by piercing my ear then cutting the barb off so i could pull it out. not a good day on the water.
776681,muskymatt,2013-03-31 18:54:00,2608,"Leaf fan obviously. Impervious to pain.  Seriously though, this guy has issues"
776715,grizzlybri,2013-03-31 23:41:00,565,"wow that guy is nuts, and the thing that gets me is he started with the large hooks then went to the small ones. but yes us leaf fans can take the pain."
776725,kickingfrog,2013-04-01 00:07:00,8333,Weak stomach? Watch the NCAA basketball highlights from today's game.
776746,Mike_D,2013-04-01 02:00:00,5,"Good plan, I started to watch it then had to close the browser. Ill just be more careful on the water to avoid having to deal with anything like that...  Mike D"
776750,ChrisK,2013-04-01 02:08:00,2772,"I thought he was going to stick himself with a little treble or single #14 but no he goes big....click, the end . Last time I saw something that big stuck in someones arm it was at Lakair. No need to see that again"
776776,Joey,2013-04-01 03:28:00,9122," Nope, no need to see that again at all Chris"
777078,mattybculp,2013-04-02 13:28:00,388,LOL. I have watched a few of these videos. I havent seen someone fail to get the hook out as badly as this guy has failed. I like when he says its because the hook is too large then switches to a smaller hook and fails again.
