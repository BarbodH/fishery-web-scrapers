The public dock in Cayuga is closed due to replacing the bridge over the river, looks like it will be most of the summer as well. The Island marina at the Dunnville bridge is locked up as it is for sale again, 1.5 million and it's yours, includes mini put course.  Went out Turkey Point way Good Friday and worked back to Nanticoke checking everything between and found nothing open other than Hoovers or water levels so low would need a ladder to get into the barge. Hoovers is useable. Marina still closed though, no gas etc. All the dock walls show a water line approx. 20 inches lower than last water mark.  Does anyone know if the private marinas along the Lynn in Dover let you launch in the spring?  I know they aren't open to the public in the summer due to parking, or are they?  Happy Easter all."
