776950,aplumma,2013-04-01 21:50:00,6896,Good job on the Cats they are my favorite fish to fish for. We have had a hard time netting Bait this spring so we have been using chunks of mackerel for now. Big fish for this year is 48 lbs (blue Cat) we are hoping to put the state record of 72 lbs to bed this year.   Art
