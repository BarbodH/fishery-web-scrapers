777031,mike rousseau,2013-04-02 02:13:00,4661,Anyone using a deep cycle battery as a starter battery...?  I know outboards typically don't charge enough for deep cycle... But 90% of my days on the water my motor is only started once then runs for 5-12 hours straight...  Anyways... Looking for experience...  Thanks

I have always used batteries of at least 800ca or more and they last at least 5 yrs and have lots of jam to start your motor.

Deep Cycles can start a motor without issue as long as you enough cranking amps. Batteries don't boil off water while under use, they boil off during the charging cycle, so if you are constantly charging it with the engine yes your elecrolyte levels can go down. An AGM woul dbe ideal if you are using it as a dual purpose as it won't lose any water but it may overheat if you overcharge it with your outboard. There are a few things to keep in mind, thats why most people just use a deep/starter combo battery for the ouboard and a true deep cycle for everything else. Less to think about. I haven't had to charge my cranking battery in 3 years.  Now if you were to be using a starting battery as a deep cycle you will run into problems with the battery. They are not designed to last through more than a charging cycles."
