776684,Beans,2013-03-31 19:07:00,3339, I had no quarrel with the medical building of which you speak Cliff except: If the lot holds 100 vehicles and they spaces turn over at least three times a day I figure they take in about $1000.00 a day times 5 days comes to about $5000.00 a week...You would think they could at least be able to pay to have the lot repaved once in a while...
776695,Big Cliff,2013-03-31 20:42:00,6899,"I won't pay it Beans, I park on a side street and walk over. I'll save my $3.00 a visit until I can't walk anymore."
776700,danc,2013-03-31 21:29:00,4677,"The parking at our fairly new state of the art hospital is reasonable. A few hour visit costs a couple bucks or so. I can't remember the exact amount because it is so reasonable. The entire system is totally mechanical. Drive up, take your ticket, arm lifts and you drive in. When you leave the hospital, there are pay machines at every exit. Insert your ticket, machine says how much you owe, deposit the amount (it even takes large bills, up to 20 dollars I think) out comes your change and another ticket that allows you to escape the parking lot. One time I lost my ticket. I even walked back out to my car thinking that I had left it in there. No luck. So I went to an information desk and told them what happened. They printed me out an exit ticket, no charge. Overall I can't complain about the system here."
776861,Beans,2013-04-01 16:15:00,3339, And there's the rub...and why I have a Handicapped sign on my dashboard...
776879,lew,2013-04-01 17:11:00,12766," The new medical building in Lakefield has handi-capped parking Norm, but they still have to pay $2 to use it.  To me, that's going just a bit too far."
776901,Sinker,2013-04-01 18:56:00,8692,"Ya, hospital parking is criminal. Last time I had to spend time visiting family, a ferw of us went in on a weekly pass. It was a lot more reasonable. If I remember right it was $46, come and go as many times as you wanted. The catch was they don't advertise it, I had to ask in order to find out about it. Saves us a lot of money tho......  S."
776951,ketchenany,2013-04-01 21:55:00,3229," thanks for all of your input, seems different areas have different rules. I myself see it has a money grab, and have no choice but to pay, especially in the GTA. (drifter you guys probaly park on the ice, lots of room).  I have had my conversation with the parking company and they will cancel my 'invoice' but I still paid close to $75 when I used their standard parking procedures. I agree at the lack of advertising regarding rates and  being in the advertising business I made my concers ver loud and clear.  Two years ago when my own mother died I voiced my concerns to Mr 'Mac$)($ and  others about this, it's not casino Rama we are going to and they get FREE parking and this jackass sends me a letter regarding how much they spent on 'healthcare'. When has it ever happened that we put $12 in a meter and come out an hour later at a hospital  even if they had posted the 'hourly rate'. When the normal wait is 8-10 hours. Again I will send my records to my MP, MPP and will also have a pee for them.  I've never asked or collected anything from then since I started working (68) but hey seem to always want more even it's throught a paki ng control entity.  I'm sure when they died it's all on our dime!  Best regards  Albert"
777135,fisherman7,2013-04-02 16:50:00,325,"Well, I've managed 7 different hospital facilities over the years and most times, I've had parking lot management as well. The parking lots need to be maintained at a higher standard than other lots due to issues with slips and trips from people who are already compromised.  So, if we didn't charge for parking, then we'd have to come up with funds from within. That would mean less money for patient care and we already don't have enough.  I know it's a sensative topic but unless funding gets increased, then the costs will passed back to the public. Various parking passes are offered to help alieviate some of the burden.  If it's any consolation, as a staff member I have to pay for parking as well.  Let the flaming begin!"
777200,ketchenany,2013-04-02 19:19:00,3229,"Yes they do take care of the parking lots better. Put in better gates and electronics gadgets to keep you in and raise the prices, because they have put them in. The hospital lots I have used in the last two years have been the same for ages and no ""special maintenance"" has been done except for the gates and lack of and attendant in most cases. If I take someone who has difficulties I drop them off at the entrance and then go park. I too have paid for parking at work. How do tou justify $12 per hour. And when was the last time you have gone into a hospital emergency and came out in an hour, more like 8-10.  Look  at the admitstrator's  pay check and it will be well over $100,000.  I will take up hospital parking charges as opposed to FREE casino parking with my MP and MPP . . ."
777213,jimmer,2013-04-02 19:54:00,2730,"I think it would be a little more than the $100,000. Parking is a revenue stream that they won't get rid of unfortunately. I'll always park somewhere else if possible. As for the poster that mentioned having to pay $100 to get into Tokyo to promote transit use; I don't think that will work in TO. They want the car driver to pay so they can fund transit expansion."

They will kill tourism and businesses will close or move out to the suburbs, we have better roads, and lower tax rates.  Charge parking at Casinos and other entertainment areas since the patrons have money to throw away.  Haven't used public transit since 1968. And never have used 407 and still get around just fine."
777275,Old Ironmaker,2013-04-02 22:43:00,8243,"Sorry, but to think hospital parking lots are maintained at higher levels than any other municipal or private lot with regard to liability issues is ridiculous. As someone that cleared snow for a bud that is in the landscaping business I can tell you no extra care was taken for these lots than any other. They all complained when snow wasn't piled high enough because they lost valuable spots they could charge for not because their due diligence standards were any higher than others."
777305,Big Cliff,2013-04-03 01:04:00,6899,"Well, as Beans explained it so well; a little building with some Dr.s offices in it can garner $5000.00 a day. I wonder what the parking at Lindsay Hospital generates in a day. The parking space there probably generates more revenue than the rest of the hospital on a sq ft basis.  Golden handshakes, stupid pensions, $100,000.00 a year + saleries, the working man is paying for it through the nose. $12.00 an hour to park is just plain stupid, a lot of the people that are stuck paying it are working for minimum wage. These aren't the people that can afford to go to a casino and drop a couple of hundred bucks, these are the average person, working people, pensioners, seniors. Go into Emerge and you are lucky if you can get in and out in under a couple of hours.  As far as needing the extra income to provide services, I thought that was what the health care tax was all about! Sorry but a government that tells us that smoking is causing health problems then taxes the stop smoking aids is just blowing smoke up our butts at our expense."
777317,ketchenany,2013-04-03 02:15:00,3229,"Cliff, you are so right. SPECIAL MAINTENANCE, my butt! Hospital and medical centres should have reasonable rates, especially when most users are seniors.  Where I was ticketed that spot can generate $104,832 a year if everyone using it paid $12 per hour to go into emergency to see someone.  If you over stay after paying the 12 the invoice for the rest of your visit is an additional 49!  Like I said, I'm taking it to my representative in government! It may not go anywhere but I will make my voice heard, no answer, no vote."

Based on the turn over I've actually seen, I figure their take is probably 20 million per year. Suspect taxes on said property are about 2 of that. Building was paid for in the first year, the rest is being put against any up rising of our hydro rates...  LMAO !"
776395,ketchenany,2013-03-30 15:26:00,3229,"I have my mother-in-law in a hospital in very serious condition. Thursday morning we were called at 5 am to come in, I drive down saw a parking spot beside a meter and punched in the max amount 12. Stuck it on my dash and rushed in. I came out 6 hours to find a parking 'invoice' for an additional $49. I spoke to someone and at that meter they charge 12 an hour! When you are called in you get there as fast as possible and don't think about such things. I did not see any signs for 12 an hour only the max $12. I went back yesterday and and has I was paying another $15 I was told that for $17 I could get a day pass! WHERE are the large signs to advise people.  A CBC report I will read later says that parking fees are another patien tax we have to pay.       WE go to the hospital to see loved ones, It's not an entertainment venue. I for one do not want free parking just reasonable rates. A lot of people make minimum wage and parking is way over that at this location (Humber River at the 400 and Finch). People that go gamble away their savings/paycheck at our casinos get FREE parking! I cannot even contest this ticket as it's called and invoice! MY MP will hear me soon.  A"
776399,Canuck2fan,2013-03-30 15:53:00,1444,"I totally agree parking charges for hospitals are out of control... When public funding PAID for and built hospitals the purchases included in most cases land for parking. I understand the need to keep those spaces available for patients, and their families and to do probably means some sort of charge to keep other cars out. That being said anything over 2 bucks in a rural town like where I live is just the hospital holding sick people hostage in my opinion. Everyone agrees visitors are beneficial and in some cases necessary so why slap huge punative parking fees on them?  Also as a person who used to work for a company that catered our hospital's executive almost weekly board  meetings and other staff planning lunches there is a TON of wasteful spending just at that level that could be put towards to lowering parking fees LOL. Another easy way to save some huge money would be to stop sending out flyers 3 or 4 times a year begging for money, that 99.9% of which just wind up in the garbage unread."

There is a medical building next door (1333 Sheppard East) . . . . .   they are just as bad. When I can, I take the TTC over & back . . . . .    $2.00 each way is a lot better than $15.00 to $24.00 maximum parking!

When I was in last summer, I added up for 1 day, 5 visitors @ $15.00 or more . . . .   these theives  get no less than $75.00 . . .  for a few hours parking!   I think I should get a cut of that, eh?

She said they are still trying to choose which ones to propose but all of them seemed pretty bad. I'm glad I'm moving away in the summer, but I think she said they are going to propose these sometime in 2014. One I will mention is charging people with vehicles a flat fee of 8$ just to enter the downtown core plus whatever you spend on parking,shopping ect. She was also talking about raising parking fees everywhere."
776458,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-30 19:59:00,8243,"I think many have been hammered by parking tickets when dealing with an emergency at or near the hospital. Recently received a $75.00 ticket at Hamilton General when I parked illegally at a meter to take care of Dad when Mom was rushed to emergency at 3 AM. I had the administration there make a copy of the admitting documentation as well as the ambulance report with the date and time on it, went to the by law office next to Hamilton Place and pled my case to the clerk there. If you have a reason as well documentation to prove your case most all parking authorities can be reasonable if you are. They quashed the ticket and told me if it happens again, and they know it, I will have to pay.  Take the ticket in with some documentation and explain, don't have anything to lose.  As far as gouging for revenue, what else is new.  Tayzak, charging to enter the city core is nothing new around the world. It was $100.00 cdn in 1995 to enter downtown Tokyo. A very good incentive to take public transit or a cab, their purpose was not to generate revenue but to encourage public transit. Regularly done in Europe as well, we don't see it as tourists but the locals will sure tell you about it."

Let's face it, I really don't ever want to go there, either as a patient or as a visitor. Visiting a patient helps a lot. When my mother was in the hospital, I would visit every day(sometimes 2 or 3 times a day).  She loved visitors and it made her last days a lot less difficult. We have free hospital parking here and that is the way it should be. Taking advantage of people like that when they are in need is just immoral.  Just my 2 cents(opps it's a nickel now). muddler"

776561,cisco,2013-03-31 07:30:00,597,"Hospitals are non-profit charitable organizations and they call the land they sit on 'private property'. So simply don't pay the fine. They aren't connected to gov't to track down your licence plate and hold tickets ransome for you renewing your licence plate. On the invoice this is evident since there isn't even an explanation how to challenge a charge.  They have the parking arms on most lots to keep you in the lot until you pay thus bringing the arm up for you to 'escape'. So only park where you have a meter to attend/ignore.  Unless you're parking in a clearly marked bad spot such as a fire emergency zone or handicapped parking spot at an entrance kinda thing, gov't won't be the ticket issuer it'll be private property renta cops. Be polite, leave and tear the thing up."
776567,blue pickeral,2013-03-31 11:02:00,267,"I saw the show on CBC and was wondering about this strategy as well. At many hospitals, there is a private company -Impark?? or something, that is contracted to do the parking. If you pay for parking, hospital gets money. If the company gives you a ticket (and the have incentive plans for their employees to hand them out) the money goe to the private contractor! Not a penny (nickel) goes to the hospital.  If there is no deal between the government (MTO?) that they can withhold your license plate re-newal (as in unpaid 407 tolls) why pay the tickets? I suppose the company could black list your vehicle if you are a frequent hospital visitor and get you towed, but it would almost pay to have someone site with your vehicle at minimum wage warning the attendents to keep their hands off.  Meanwhile, lobby your locally elected municipal councillors to pass a by-law which would ban the charging of public parking at public institutions. One mayor was interviewed in the story and the town had banned the use of parking meters in the hospital lot."
776569,ketchenany,2013-03-31 11:07:00,3229,If you don't pay or get it cancelled they will send it to a collection agency and credit bureau. I will contest this as much as I can after the funeral.  BTW this lot and all parking issues are controlled by private firm and they can do what they want. I guess the hospital gets a portion of the take.  Happy Easter to all.
776573,Big Cliff,2013-03-31 11:28:00,6899,"One of the buildings here in Lindsay that has Dr.s offices, a drug store, and Lab in it has paid parking, $3.00 flat rate so even if you run in to pick up a perscription it is $3.00. Everything in front of the building is marked as a fire route, $45.00 fine. Now ifn fairness, if you do get a perscription filled at the drug store, they will give you the $3.00. The hospital here is $4.00/half hour metered or $8.00 a day long term and  for that you have to park about 100 meters from the entrance."

Bend over, its only going to get worse.    Wishing all a happy Easter."

776586,mcdougy,2013-03-31 13:02:00,274,"op. sorry to hear of your loss.  Hospitals are a shhty place to be and visit. After the visit, the last thing you get to do is feed a $20 into a stupid machine. One thing that is availlable at a lot of hospitals, that they dont tell you about, is a monthly parking pass. In London a visitor month pass was in the neighborhood of $85. It's still too much, a pain to acquire, but is considerably cheaper than paying daily. We even got a system going where we would pass it around the family at""sitting changes"", or meet them in the lot when we left and give it to them once you got out of the gate. Silly measures to take, but were talking 100s of dollars a week if visiting daily."
776640,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-31 16:32:00,8243," Not that simple, all Hamilton hospitals have an agreement with the city concerning parking. Same ramifications for not paying as if you parked illegally in front of City Hall. If on a private lot like Shoppers Drug Mart the police won't ticket on private property but the store can have your car towed for many many reasons. Same as parking at a disabled spot on private property, police won't ticket but your vehicle might not be there when you get back."
