776877,lew,2013-04-01 17:01:00,12766,"Jeeez, and I thought we had it bad with some ice on the deck this morning and the few passing flurries we've been having today.  Now I don't feel so bad"
776878,fishnsled,2013-04-01 17:10:00,3520,That one heck of a dumping of snow!!   Jealous of the more sledding part but I'm looking forward to having the boat in the water this coming weekend...if the weather cooperates for the big water.
776880,Fisherman,2013-04-01 17:12:00,7201,"Nice picture of the fox, love to see them in action."
776883,grimsbylander,2013-04-01 17:18:00,3016,Amazing. Down here in the banana belt we're whining because we've had flurries with no accumulation! LOL  I've known a guy for years that grew up in Manitouwadge...he told me the fishing was great and your pike confirmed it. Very nice!
776888,Big Cliff,2013-04-01 17:51:00,6899,Nothing on the ground here but it sure is blowing a lot.
776889,Rod Caster,2013-04-01 17:56:00,5784,I want a pike like that out of MY sportspal!!
776893,mr blizzard,2013-04-01 18:10:00,1589,"Basskicker looks like Yellowknife.........you would love it up here, went up the ice roads yesterday and landed some nice trout, but your pike would have considered my trout a snack  Great pictures . Looks beautiful, Gotta love winter, to bad summer is coming lol  Winter up here opens up alot of areas for fishing that u cannot get access to in the summer.  Enjoy some sledding for me."
776894,misfish,2013-04-01 18:21:00,29133," I was thinking the same thing Lew. And you will be happy to know,I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF WINTER.. Cant amagine how you musky guys get through it.LOL"

777001,Joey,2013-04-02 00:14:00,9122,"Jeez, that is a cruel joke!!  Nice picture of the fox"
777006,solopaddler,2013-04-02 00:35:00,8605,"    Not Manitouwage. My sportspal on a back lake near my camp in QC.  The only thing this post does for me is make me sick to my stomach. Doubt our fly in will be happening on May 11.  Thanks for that Jason, appreciate it."
777012,Basskicker,2013-04-02 01:04:00,421,"Sorry Mike, was not my intention to make you sick to your stomach, but its literally still making ice up here, it was actually +10'C on Friday and only -8 for a high today, going down to - teens for the next few nights.  Thanks"
