We made out last one out of a old piece of pipe, a pulley and a big Penn reel..  unfortunately I've got two planer boards so need a dual system...   I was still thinking of using a steel pipe with fitting to sit in the 2 3/4 pedestal mount in the front of the Lund.   Maybe some pulleys from PA, only question is the reels themselves..  I'm sure someone here has done this before, any pointers/tips would be appreciated!"

777438,Loonietoon,2013-04-03 21:55:00,1450,I made mine with a pipe then used 2 cloth line pulleys to hold the line with 2 small pulleys at the top of the mast to send the line out.. in the cloth line pulleys I drilled a hole and put a piece of dowling in as a crank handle.. works great
