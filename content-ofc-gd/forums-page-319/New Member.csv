Just kidding Mike you will enjoy your time with us, a real great group of folks and no Bull info and carrying on. Someone recently said everyone loves pics here, I still need to get a Fliker account to post pics. Looking forward to see some of your monster bucket mouths and bronzbacks.  I'm a Lake Erie bass guy myself. I don't even know what a trout looks like and thought salmon comes in a can.  Welcome Mike."
