776097,Canitalian,2013-03-28 17:48:00,75,Thank you.
776568,Canitalian,2013-03-31 11:06:00,75,Happy Easter everyone. Eat hearty and keep your stick on the ice. TTYL
776610,Radnine,2013-03-31 14:20:00,1538," Thanks man, you too! Bayfront park is where I launch the boat every year for the spring tune up. It has the best free ramp, docking, and boat/trailer parking that you will find. A great facility and one of the few examples of a government doing something right that you will find! I will also be fishing it this year to get to use the new bait caster along Burlington's shoreline. Jim"

776724,CRAPPIE,2013-04-01 00:04:00,213,Any ice or open water?  Thanks!
776726,Canitalian,2013-04-01 00:10:00,75,"You mean, how's it down there now? I'm sure it should be open water by now. Been a week or so since I've been there."
776748,fishing,2013-04-01 02:03:00,167,"2 or 3 days ago, still about 50 feet of ice left in boat launch area."
776751,registerfly,2013-04-01 02:15:00,198,"there is still some ice, as of Fri am. Edge was okay for guys like us in our yaks to get through. Might be a little wider opening after yesterday's sun. But agreed is a very nice facility for launch and parking."
776752,hotsky,2013-04-01 02:15:00,400,I was there on Friday still some ice but saw a guy plow thru it in a small boat.
777244,CRAPPIE,2013-04-02 21:03:00,213,"Hi there,  Any ice left in the Bayfront park? would like to try one more time for ice fishing this Saturday!  Thanks in advance!"
