776799,FloatnFly,2013-04-01 12:32:00,1640,"i think the only issue you'd have is getting a trailer plate, but to get around that, do not tell them you bought a boat and trailer, tell them you had the trailer built since i assume its only a singe axle, not sure on the actual boat, i believe as long as you have registration numbers on it, you're legal on the water"
776801,steelhedrmatt,2013-04-01 12:38:00,278,"There is no registration no. on the boat.  the trailer, i'll probably just tell them its homemade.  That part is easy."
