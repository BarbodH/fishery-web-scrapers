776244,Handlebarz,2013-03-29 12:45:00,3790,Well when I first released my black/white logo I wanted to release this one first or at the same time but I could not get it to save as it is a huge file yesterday my sticker guy helpped me out and I now have it on my computer. Here is the new colour logo hope ya all like it.

776263,Old Ironmaker,2013-03-29 14:32:00,8243,"You know what they say, if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything. Well now I'm going to comment on your logo Mike P, now that I see it in color that is a great logo. That is a Musky for sure.  You picked the right artist, he or she caught the caricature of a fish which isn't easy. You now have to start the process of having that image protected by a copyright. I don't think it will cost you huge however regardless of price you want to get the image protected. Wouldn't it be a shame if you turned on the fishing Chanel and see that image stolen by another retailer. Hopefully your artist doesn't have the rights to it."
776281,grt1,2013-03-29 17:33:00,638,"if that is what is going on your tshirts, i need a few."
776284,Loonietoon,2013-03-29 18:23:00,1450,"Looks Fantastic Mike, Make mine 2 for the Oddessy XL See you there for sure"

Sorry but no colour shirts  As for copy write I waited to respond here until I found out and yes it has his own copy write on it and I have full rights to use it from the artist.

776965,ketchenany,2013-04-01 22:42:00,3229,"Looks good, but, typographycally  the space between the bullets (round dots Is not equal from the left and right side, I'd get adjusted  if possible, but not a big deal, I have an eye for logos.  Yes, do get it registered, a TM can be kept for a while but registered is for ever. I don't have the figures on hand."
776986,Handlebarz,2013-04-01 23:42:00,3790,I'm a little off so it look perfect to me

777421,Handlebarz,2013-04-03 20:22:00,3790,Thanks guys for the odyssey we will just have the black/white shirts and stickers. I wanted to get the colour ones but it looks like they will not be done in time. The shirts are short sleeve only but are the high quality guilden ultra ones not cheap thin crappy ones these will last. Like my lures I want to have a better product.
