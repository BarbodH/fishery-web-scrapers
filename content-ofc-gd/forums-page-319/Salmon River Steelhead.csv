775909,solopaddler,2013-03-27 17:21:00,8605,"Seven friends, myself included, travelled to the Salmon River on Lake Ontario's south shore last week for a few days of steelheading. It was a gathering of sorts and a meeting of very old friends and a couple of new ones.  Under normal circumstances I'm a solitary creature when it comes to steelheading so this was a bit different and it made for a ton of fun.  Shockingly when we arrived in Pulaski in the wee hours of the morning last Friday we were greeted with a full fledged snow storm. The lake effect snow hitting that little corner of the world was remarkable. It tapered off as we began to fish, but a good 8"" fell adding to the already substantial base.  Spring is here? Not in Pulaski it isn't.  Rather than a long drawn out synopsis I'll let the photos do the talking this time.                                                                       And finally Billy. He was thoroughly enamored with the girl in the Fat Nancy's ad, and curled up sound asleep with her next to him.  (couldn't resist LOL!)      Beautiful river, beautiful fish, and a great group of friends.  Can't wait to do it again!    Cheers        "

775935,kickingfrog,2013-03-27 19:24:00,8333, Just 'cause it tastes like water doesn't mean it is water.

775985,Paulus,2013-03-28 00:29:00,522,"Thanks for a great trip, Mike. It was the most fun ""near-frostbite"" I've had in years! I think I lost 10 lbs trudging through those kilometers of snow. Thank goodness the American micro breweries turn out a better product. I got to really put the boots to my ""après pêche"" thirst - and no hangover! (haha billyyyyy!)  p.-"

Too classic MIke, you and Bill and that fresh pod of chromers.Glad to be able to say my camera survived the swim ! Looking forward to the next time , Oliver"
776006,solopaddler,2013-03-28 02:15:00,8605,"    I knew Paul was a member here, but I had know idea you were Oliver!  For the benefit of those who don't know, these two guys are primarily responsible for the fine photos displayed in this post and are just all around nice guys.  You're both good men. 'Till next time gentlemen!  Cheers"
776040,jdmls,2013-03-28 11:53:00,575,Nice fish boys! End of March in Pulaski though ?? The main run from Feb has already pushed through the system to the hatchery..   Mid april once those fish get released is when you wanna be on the SR for the crazy #'s from what I  have collected.  Beautiful to see it in the snow though!
776044,BillM,2013-03-28 12:34:00,17367, You might wanna tell that to all the fresh fish we caught
776046,danc,2013-03-28 12:44:00,4677,Wonderful report Mike.
776051,beanut21,2013-03-28 13:08:00,9," X2 ,   Having fished it in April and done well on a mix of dropbacks and fresh fish. Sure there's lots up top, maybe the bulk of them, but those reports come from the guys who fish up there and not down lower. The Salmon has a looong stretch of fishable water and fish throughout. Peace"
776057,highdrifter,2013-03-28 13:45:00,2534,"Wow, what a place!  Thanks for the write up Mike.  Really good photo opps.  Good to see some familiar faces too.  Pretty solid bunch of dudes right thar.  And Paul does a wicked Bubbles!!  HAHAH!!  cheers HD"
776076,lhousesoccer,2013-03-28 16:45:00,442,"Awesome photos, Mike.  I like it when someone knows how to use a camera!  Not some crappy cell phone pic.  Glad the trip was good.  I love the Salmon River, and fresh fish just continue to pour into that place all winter long.  I don't know what it is about that area, but lake effect snow will fall there when it's brown and green everywhere else.  I've fished the Salmon R. every month between Nov. and April over the years, and had snow in every one of those months on one trip or another.  Good times."
