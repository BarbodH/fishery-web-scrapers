He invented the weedless trolling motor prop and a bunch of other fishing products. Sad day for the bass fishing community. I remeber meeting him at a young age and he was really a great guy. I also learned today that he was born in Canada. He caught more than 800 bass over 10lbs.http://www.wired2fish.com/legendary-inventor-angler-doug-hannon-passes-p18084http://www.bassmaster.com/news/doug-hannon-dead-66Heres a few of my favorite videos he made:  http://www.youtube.com/embed/mGjKcFcaT2M?list=UUynoqKmKns_8D8f6GPQ7YNA ""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Le0CAyCofXY?list=UUynoqKmKns_8D8f6GPQ7YNA"

Up until them I was a trout and walleye guy pretty much  I bought that pack of lures from Barkleys early 80's, fished them out in quinte with what I had which was only walleye spinning rods. On the trip out east next weekend walked out of Barkleys with a Shimano Bantam Mag 10 on a 6 ft pistol grip bait casting rod and a couple weeks later added a Bantam 200 baitcast combo"
