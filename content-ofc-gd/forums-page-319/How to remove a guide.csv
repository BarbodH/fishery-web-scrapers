776625,Garnet,2013-03-31 15:29:00,2056,Right on top of guide. Cut with exacto knife. Just 1 thread. Now un ravel.
776626,Muskieman,2013-03-31 15:30:00,2472,"Oh one of those guides , I was gonna say , just throw him overboard.  "
776627,DRIFTER_016,2013-03-31 15:30:00,10439,Take a single sided razor blade and lay it parallel to the blank on top of the guide foot. Cut the thread/finish going towards the leg of the guide. Then the guide will come off easily. You should then be able to peel most of the finish/thread off with your fingers. If you need to remove any left over finish lightly heat the area with a heat gun and scrape with the edge of a popsicle stick.  Eazy peazy!!!!
776628,Terry,2013-03-31 15:34:00,14456,my thoughts too
776629,misfish,2013-03-31 15:39:00,29133,"Thanks guys.  Terry,can you swim?"
776633,Terry,2013-03-31 15:56:00,14456,"lol I never claimed to be a guide,Kemosabe     lol  or just have the seat break to tip him overboard"

776679,Sandbag,2013-03-31 18:46:00,533,My truck door usually removes them for me..............................................   Cheers  Craig
776687,misfish,2013-03-31 19:30:00,29133," Tried that,didnt work.LOL  Thanks Dave and all.  Done. Now to see how my wrapping skills are for the new guide."
776755,kemper,2013-04-01 02:27:00,2232,"Are you talking about turning it into an ice rod?If not, you will have all sorts of  trouble casting without replacing a couple guides with larger ones near the reel."
776789,misfish,2013-04-01 09:58:00,29133," Yep,looks like a few of them are coming off. I have a couple of old rods with the steel eyes.Think I,ll use them."
776792,Garnet,2013-04-01 11:17:00,2056,"Finally a good use for the phone book.  Take 2 piece of computer paper and run thread between them. Start about the middle of the phone book and keep adjusting until you get right tension,"
776870,misfish,2013-04-01 16:45:00,29133, Ya lost me.
776891,bare foot wader,2013-04-01 18:03:00,1354, use the phonebook as a homemade tensioner to wrap the new guide...use 2 sheets of computer paper so you don't rub the phonebook ink onto your new thread
