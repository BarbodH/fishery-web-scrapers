Lots of suckers to keep us busy until finally the cherry corn and the hair rig hooked a spring fatty. They are feeding agressively in pods the last few days on the lynn , surely from the warm snap. They were all over the surface in the evening.  "

776600,hammercarp,2013-03-31 13:46:00,964,Good one Rich.
776613,Mike Pike,2013-03-31 14:24:00,1332,A real spring beauty there Rich.  Love the gold and bronze colour on her.  I went out yesterday to a local swim and didn't even have a line bump so I'm a little envious right now.
776615,mike rousseau,2013-03-31 14:43:00,4661,Nice...  We somehow managed to miss 4 on Friday...  So I'm out solo today to try and get a run....  Looks warmer where you are tho... I have ice floating by me... Lol
776643,Marko,2013-03-31 16:43:00,854,So jelaous buddy...so jelaous. Nice fish!
776649,Locnar,2013-03-31 16:59:00,645,"Another good outing eh! If I'm ever down that a ways, I'll have to give you a shout haha."
776699,Rich,2013-03-31 21:24:00,3927,Thanks everyone! The cold snap is setting in again. I think by next weekend carp fishing will be insanely good in the lynn. Can't wait. Also looking forward to big spring channel cats soon!
