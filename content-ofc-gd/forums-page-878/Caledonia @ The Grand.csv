320350,shayne,2009-03-22 19:46:00,21,"The dam in Caledonia has turned into a ""Redneck Circus""!! On any given day, this time of year there are 20 guys poaching steelhead!! I live 20 min away, and didn't even attempt to steelhead during season!! Got just as many or more, up river. No ""Redneck fishing team"" there either!!"
