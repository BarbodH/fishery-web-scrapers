Did a lot of reading but have few practical questions.  1) Most plates I've seen are mounted kind of under angle with the bottom of the plate following the bottom of the boat. How about mounting the plate so the top of the plate is paralel to the ground and the bottom of the plate is shaped to follow the contour of the boat's bottom? I'd think it may look more natural?  2) Screwing the plate or just gluing it? With say 3M 5200 adhesive? Or screwing and caulking with marine silicon around the edges?  3) Any advice you care to share to avoid mistakes?  Thanks, Ice Fisherman"

Stick it on there with the 5200.....unless someone can advise something better? I wouldn't screw it on....aren't you putting it on there so you don't  screw the ducers thru the hull??  Sinker"
320556,HTHM,2009-03-23 03:22:00,4082,"I would suggest that you use a marine grade adhesive, (if a hole can be avoided that is a good thing) and when you are lining up the transducers try to make sure they are parallel to the bottom of the water body. As well, you will want to make sure that the transducers are on different frequencies to eliminate interference and false readings."
