320562,maybe,2009-03-23 03:28:00,307,"Happy to bow and worship at your feet, sir!  I'm just here to provide the idiot baseline, same as last year.  After every race, I swap out the existing picks and replace with the top points guys in each division.  No more, no less, no clue.  Was good for a solid middle-of-the-pack finish last year.  Sucks so far this year...I just crawled UP to 18th!"
320600,MAzing,2009-03-23 11:14:00,43,For the fun of it how many points do you have?
320689,diggyj,2009-03-23 14:26:00,548," I think my handle id is diggyj, my team name is Dirk's Destroyers. I am starting to think the name is more appropriate as my pics seem to be banging more fenders and metal than dominating.  Dirk..."
320832,Daplumma,2009-03-23 18:58:00,1961,"Mazing,I have 1428 pts.If you are in a Yahoo league you can join our group and your points will transfer I think.Despite my boasting here its a pretty good group and I dont think anyone takes it real seriously,which is why I like it.Dirk,you took a whoopin yesterday.....ouch! Joe"
320870,diggyj,2009-03-23 21:16:00,548, Don't need a reminder. Pics were based on last years results. Also tried to get some new guys into the lineup. Oh well. Always the next race. I'm sure everyone will have a week like that at some point.  Dirk..
