Efficiency at the boat ramp only matters if it's crowded Simon... I don't think y'all have that problem up there, do you?    It was funny, I had to bite my tongue so hard at time to keep from laughing, I had blood squirting out of my eyeballs and flames shooting out of my   I don't run the camera at the launch so as not to embarass anyone any more than they already are.  ... but for you... I'll make an exception!    Thanks for the kind words y'all!!!"
319740,Leecher,2009-03-20 22:12:00,7832,"Great report and pics Glen   Got to love it when the bite is on!!!   I remember going through the same amount of minnows on ice last year.... but tell me, how many rods are you allowed in the water??  That 14""er is a real nice slab   and that cat too!!  Congratulations Thanks for sharing Jacques"
319941,Spiel,2009-03-21 13:15:00,9065,"  Okay, that makes sense. Very conservation minded of you Glen or perhaps it's selfishness? Are you hoping to eat all the offspring once harvestable."
319949,Greencoachdog,2009-03-21 14:53:00,8163," Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!! Crappie offspring!!!... nom nom nom!!!    The lake I fish most of the time (Neely Henry) has a 3 rod limit, the lake right above it (Lake Weiss) on the same river chain also has a 3 rod limit. These are the only 2 lakes in the State of Alabama that have a limit on the number of rods you can fish with. You can use as many rods as you want on all the other lakes... you could use 100 or more if you wanted to!!!  I really like the 3 rod limit on lake Henry! It reduces traffic and fishing pressure from the Spider Rig Crappie fishermen!  They rig their boats with 10-15 rods per person and do the slow troll method.  Here's a guy that fishes 16 rods by himself:     This is completely leagal down here except for the 2 lakes I mentioned."
319980,Leecher,2009-03-21 16:27:00,7832," Thanks Glen for the info     3 rod limit is good and certainly don't need more than that!! I understand now why you gone through 6 - 7 dozens      Man must be chaotic at times when all 3 rods get a hit and you're by yourself!!  Wish we had the same regulations up here on some of the lakes we target.... ah well, that's why I love fishing on hard water.... can use 5 but sometimes expensive on the live bait Jacques"
320038,Greencoachdog,2009-03-21 21:31:00,8163," Minnows are cheaper down here Jacques, $1.25 a dozen and they don't count them out. They use a small can to dip them out of the net with and it's usually 18 or 20 to the can."
320199,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-22 12:32:00,1362,Great report Glen and nice additions for TEAM SLAMMERS   ....
320200,web-fisherman,2009-03-22 12:37:00,54,WOW - Nice Crappie!  Im a bit jealous simply because we wont see those water temps for another 2 months. I see you must be fishing in Alabama.
320203,Greencoachdog,2009-03-22 12:45:00,8163," Yes, central Alabama.  The water has warmed up nicely, no longer freezing cold when you wash the Catfish slime off of your hands.  The Crappie should be ""doing the nasty"" in anothe week or two, they usually spawn down here when the water hits the 62*F range."
320305,fishboy,2009-03-22 17:49:00,550,great pics and a better story!
318880,Greencoachdog,2009-03-18 16:18:00,8163,"Got on the water at 11:00 a.m yesterday, it was a beautiful day with lots of sunshine... but the north wind was still chilly. The water temp was between 55-59*F depending where you were.  I fished all over the lake from 10-80 FOW, the only place I could get a bite was from 26-30 FOW... and it was mainly little Blue bait stealer cats with a couple baby Spotted Bass, dinky Channel cats, and a baby Bluegill thrown in.  I had 6 or 7 dozen minnows, and needed every one of them!!! It didn't matter where I went, the bait stealers were there!  ... but it was a pretty day and at least I was catching something!  I tried Bass fishing for a little while... they were either not interested or not at home. The only thing I could get a bite on was the Sabiki rig loaded with live minnows.  Things didn't start getting interesting until late afternoon, just as the sun had slipped behind the trees... then the fish were on FIRE!!! I was fishing in 26 FOW and pulling up little blue cats 2 and 3 at a time on the Sabiki! Then I got a good hit! I could tell it wasn't a cat because it wasn't doing the catfish roll, it was zooming from side to side and fighting like crazy... I thought it might be a decent Spot, but was very surprised to see this 14"" Crappie come to the top!!!    I was still catching the little Blues left and right and thought I had a pretty nice one on, but brought up a small blue and this Crappie (another double) on the same line!  This pic flashed very soon after iI touched the camera (thought I had the self timer on), I took another pic but it came out even blurrier.  The action kept up until I ran out of minnows, first time in a long time that I've used up all of my minnows!   It had gotten pretty dark by then and I was putting everything up and getting ready to go back to the launch when I noticed that the 3rd rod I had out with a single homemade 3/8 oz jig (glow chartreuse and black and blue fleck) baited with the baby Bluegill I had caught earlier was snagged because I'd drifter up into shallower water while putting everything away. I backtracked to retrieve the snagged jig and as soon as it pulled free I got a BIG hit!!! I don't know if the Bluegill was still on it or not, but this fish put up the best fight of the day... pulling drag and making me giggle like a school girl!!!  Got the to the top, jambed my thumb in it's mouth and could barely see that it was a nice Channel Cat! Threw the fish into the livewell and headed to the launch.  When I got to the launch, it was a disaster of epic proportions!!! There was 8 boats waiting to trailer, and what a circus it was!!! The best episode of ""Boat Launch Bozo's"" I've seen in a while!!! Somebody backed a truck and trailer down the ramp and another guy in a boat pulls up onto the trailer with people in another boat hollering at him ""wrong truck, wrong truck""... he was so anxious to leave he pulled his boat onto the wrong trailer... I had to turn my head and bite my tongue to keep from laughing outloud!!!  So he backs off the trailer and the right boat goes onto the trailer. You could really tell that most of these folks hadn't had their boats out in a while, trucks and trailer backing down the ramp that looked like drunk snakes, one guy had to pull his boat on and off the trailer 3 times before he got it right. Another guy had a brand new I/O, he backs the trailer down perfectly and gets out of the truck and runs to the boat to pull it on the trailer, his rather large wife hands him the rope and he gets into the boat and pulls it up on the trailer perfectly while his wife runs (or maybe a fast waddle) around to fasten the bow hook... the he fiddles around in the boat for 5 minutes trying to figure out how to tilt the motor up, he gets aggravated and gets out of the boat on the trailer and tells his wife to climb into the boat (from the trailer) to watch and make sure the skeg doesn't drag... well watching her trying to climb into the boat from the trailer was amusing to say the least!She finally makes it into the boat as he starts pulling up the ramp and yells out to her to see if it was going to hit, she runs to the back of the boat (pulling up a steep ramp) and enertia takes over! She hits the back of the boat and I can see her legs go up in the air, she almost goes over when gravity reclaims her and I hear the thud on the bottom of the boat. She hollers out to the husband everything is ok and up the ramp they go!  I opted to wait and be the last one to trailer so I could take pics of my Channel cat and watch the show, it's hard to buy entertainment like that... let alone get it for free!!!  ... and here's Mr. Channel Cat!    All fish were released to fight another day!"
318882,tinbanger,2009-03-18 16:29:00,1028,AH yes the boat launch follies  Nice Crappies!  TB
