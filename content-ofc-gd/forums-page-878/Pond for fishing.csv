320055,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-21 22:23:00,10439,When I lived in Grand Valley I had a pond in the yard stocked with rainbows. It was nice hauling out the fly rod after a days work.
320082,OhioFisherman,2009-03-22 00:05:00,6623,"It was a thought for me when I purchased my property, I should have researched it more before I bought the property. My land and neighbors has an underground stream bed wandering through it. I first noticed signs of it when the neighbors on the east side of me put in their large garden, they were kicking up a lot of gravel using the roto-tiller.  Neighbors on the west side of me hired a guy to put one in about 100 feet behind their home. I came home from work one day and they had piles of dirt pushed all over their yard and 2 bulldozers sitting in the yard. They had scraped all the top soil off the out line of a pond.  I went next door and talked to them, did they dig any test holes with a backhoe? No? They should have, a lot of gravel just under the surface, it might not hold water or be very costly to get it to hold water.  Next day they had a backhoe out and one scoop hit gravel and the hole filled with water in seconds. A few more holes and scoops still was bring up gravel and holes filling with water. All that has to be dug out and hauled away not good to dike up an end and no telling how much area was like that with out digging holes all over.  Neighbor to the west of them has one in his front yard, maybe 3/4 an acre? His home is set back off the road about 150 feet farther than ours, and he had no problems.  Lot of ponds in my area but choices of location and size on my property would be very limited."

If I don't get back you in a day or two shoot me a PM and I'll get you some info!  Cheers, UF"

Three fully stocked ponds, specs, rainbow, and walleye. 50 acres with a couple of cabins plus the main house, camp sites, petting zoo. Anyone want to run their own business and get to fish every day?"
