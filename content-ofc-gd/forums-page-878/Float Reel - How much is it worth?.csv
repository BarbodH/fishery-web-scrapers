I am just getting into float fishing so would this be a good reel to start with? This reel is on eBay and I was just wondering what it would go for in stores?  This is the info on the reel: - 4.5"" diameter ultra smooth running centre pin - Stainless steel shaft - One piece machine cut aluminium frame - One piece machine cut aluminium spool - 2 German HPB stainless ball bearings - On/off ratchet - Neoprene reel pouch included - Line capacity: 275yds 8lb line - 5 year warranty  "
320022,bassjnkie,2009-03-21 20:05:00,1101,A buddy or mine bought one new this year for $200 at some place in Orangeville. You can also get them for $200 on ebay shipped from Ontario.
320076,lucabrasi,2009-03-21 23:51:00,114,I started with the same reel. It's a good reel for the money (ie. what I paid for it). I got mine on ebay for $169 CDN. It retails for as much as $289 CDN. You can shop around and probably get it stateside for a lot cheaper. For $289 you could do a lot better with a used Islander or any of the Ravens.  just my 0.02
320080,Greencoachdog,2009-03-21 23:59:00,8163,I personally... wouldn't have it!!!... there's too many good Shimano spinning reels out there for half the price!!!
320177,Great Lake Steel,2009-03-22 10:27:00,41,I know where you can buy them new (with the store standing behind it) for 200.
