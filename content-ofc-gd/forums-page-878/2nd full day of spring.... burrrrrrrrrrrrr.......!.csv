And there are signs of spring... geese are back, 2 bald eagles, 1 sea-gull, 1 lonely robin... and lots of LBJs (little brown jobbies).  Ice fishing season is over and the walleyes are taking a well deserved break from all the pressure...  Lots of wind this winter... I've got a ton of branches (and trees) to clean up... going to be lots of bon-fires... soon.  Cheers.......!   the capt."

Of course... ,with every cut of the saw, I'm thinking how much these OFC boys are goin' to enjoy cooking this nice white pine....!  But don't thank me.. thank Mother Nature for wiping up 100km/hr winds... to knock the heck out of my forest... ""and it all came down...""  Lots of singles off the roofs too...  NO flying fish ...however... thank God.. for the ice to keep them all contained...!"
