Often times, work is slow, and I find my way onto OFC, my favourite site on the internet.  Well, one of the at least.  And every time I log in, I have the word EPIC shoved in my face.  Come on guys, if ever there was a word so over-used on an internet forum, it is EPIC.  I am guilty of having used the word Epic, and its evil counterpart, Banner.  Now, whenever I lay my eyes upon these words, my stomach turns, I need new vocabulary, come on OFC, I know you have it in you ... how about marvelous? stupendous?  Okay ridiculous I know, well lets brainstorm and come up with new words to describe those, dare I say it? Epic ... days on the water!  Legendary? Exceptional?  Outstanding? Extraordinary? Phenominal?   Come to think of it..... they dont do the same thing as Epic ....  Bring on the Epic reports...."
320515,jace,2009-03-23 02:07:00,472,that's a good rant.  ...of epic proportions.

320520,Moosebunk,2009-03-23 02:11:00,3970,"I was gonna try ""bonerifficabular.""  I'll try it in a sentence...  My right ear pointed west heard the faint jingle dingle of a bell.  I turned, squinted into the setting sun, when I saw the silhoutte of my rod tip pointing down the hole.  I ran like a samarai cheetah and giver'd a big biceptual hookset.  A monsterous pike screeled the reel on many powerful runs before coming up the hole in one most bonerifficabular moment."

320538,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-23 02:35:00,0,"usage of the word ""epic"" has gone up 33.3% since this thread was authored.  i say epic but usually only in the form of me saying ""EPIC FAIL""...  for example while casting reeds for hammerhandles my counterpart gets a huge birdnest in his baitcaster.  i scoff at his folly and state ""EPIC FAIL""...  lol."
