317910,Radnine,2009-03-16 11:33:00,1538,"I think that I am going on Friday. My son and I will likely take the go train. It is the closest thing to a March break activity that we have planned and the train ride will likely be as big a thrill as anything that he will encounter at the show. I am hoping to put together two walleye rigs for this coming year. So I am looking for two med. light 6'6"" fast or ex. fast and looking to couple them up with a 1500 size reel (likely Daiwa Exceler, I like them and have three already). So I will be looking for a deal on those items. Hope to run into some OFC'rs while there. Jim"

I don't really need anything but it's  nice to just wander around and look at stuff and as always, I'll probably spend at least a couple hundred $$$$ on all those things I don't need  There's always been free parking at Ontario Place.....an extra 5 minute walk..... but someone mentioned recentely on another post that it wasn't available anymore."
