(is it worth the trip?)  i was just wondering as what are the mainly feeding on / hitting ?  as well as is it tru i can fish any where on lake ontario right now unless other wise stated? such as frenchmans bay , oshawa harbor , and basicly anything south of the 401?  (Idealy looking to fish for pike)  Thanks again -A fellow angler"

320578,fish-miester,2009-03-23 04:09:00,864,is frenchmans bay open to fish all year ?
320580,GBW,2009-03-23 04:15:00,8460,why don't you tell us all what you want to fish for?  then maybe someone can point you in the right direction...
320726,fishermccann,2009-03-23 15:24:00,655,"Yes Frenchmans bay is open all year, yesterday they were catching suckers and pike there."
320758,fish-miester,2009-03-23 16:30:00,864,id like to go for pike.. and well anything else that would be hitting..
320765,GBW,2009-03-23 16:35:00,8460,then any part of zone 20 is good to go BUT check the Reg's as pike will close Mar 31 and reopen 1st Sat. in May.
