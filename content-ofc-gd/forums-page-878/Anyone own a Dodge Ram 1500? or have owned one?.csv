320883,Mattones,2009-03-23 21:56:00,587,less then 24 hours and you al lwill see pictures of the beast :D:D
320894,aplumma,2009-03-23 22:24:00,6896,good for you I have been a dodge fan for years. I have had all of the big brand name trucks and if it wasn't for my love for Nissan I would still be driving a Dodge pick up  truck. I would check to see if the truck has synthetic lubricant in it.... if not I would change it after a few thousand miles I am sure the motorheads will sing the praises of the liquid gold.  P.S. if the tires are spinning then the engines drinkin.....   Art
319826,smokin joe,2009-03-21 01:01:00,226,Just remember it's not as much the engine size as the gear ratio of the drivetrain that determines MPG.  I drive a Ram 2500 and get around 18 city and 26 on the hwy.
319830,Cudz,2009-03-21 01:09:00,2652,??? Maybe with a worked in Cummins Diesel.  Those are pretty optimistic numbers. I have a friend with an 06 Ram 5.7 with the MDS and he can only 19 mpg and that is driving 100 km/h on a very flat section.
319831,smokin joe,2009-03-21 01:13:00,226,"  Yes I have the Cummins and running the heavy duty tow package as well, but my point was that the mileage is still decided by the gearing was all.  Just didn't want people comparing strictly engine size and getting the wrong info was all."
319926,Billy Bob,2009-03-21 11:49:00,5865," Toyota is said to now be working on a 8 speed tranny to improve gas mileage. The current 5.7 L engine with it's 6 speed tranny (2 overdrives) still gets 19 mpg on the HIGHWAY. I went round trip from Lancaster, NY to Chapleau, Ontario and got 19.38 miles per gallon. But this was NOT towing anything, however I did get stuck in traffic on the way home near Toronto and had a 35 minute wait getting across the Rainbow bridge on the way home. On the way there we left early and NO slow ups at all. But without the two slow ups on the way home I am thinking I could of cracked 20 mpg. Of course this is driving with a easy foot and keeping the speed down to 62 miles per hour.  This is with a DOUBLE CAB 4X4 SR5 Model, not just a regular cab 2 wheel drive.  The one thing to remember with the Tundra is it has TONS of towing power. With it's 5.7L engine it produces 381 hp with 401 # of torque and is match with 4:30 rear end gear ratio that can tow 10,800 lbs all day every day. It was designed for towing and hauling. IF Toyota put in higher gears like GM, let say 3:5O or 3:73 rear end gears it would EASILY break the 20 mpg with it's 6 speed tranny. With gas prices going to rise in the next year or two watch Toyota to make changes to drastically increase mileage. The new '07 Tundra was built when our gas prices were stable. Of course you can also look for the Small Three to also increase gas mileage in all there trucks.  Good Luck Truck Hunting and have fun with your new sweet ride.  Bob"
319928,FISHINGNUT,2009-03-21 11:53:00,253,"I have an o6 sport 4x4 with the hemi and I am lucky if I get 15mpg ,The motor has an annoying tick already its failed to start 3 times this winter (dealer cant figure out why) the tranny shifts hard ,the front end has been replaced twice and is loose again it just doesnt seem to have the same punch any more and it only has 42k on it.When I first picked it out it was all about the styling and the hemi ,but I find the ford and  chev are way more comfortable,It does pull the boat like its not even there but so did my super crew Larriot that was way better on fuel and more comfortable.I have to admit that the new 09 are looking sweet but so do the new fords and chevs ,If you are concerned with fuel mileage than you shouldt even be looking at trucks ,It comes down to personnel choice they all have there pros and cons.My dodge goes back to the dealer in 2 weeks I am not saying I wouldnt buy another dodge just not the one I have right now .By the way the truck was in every 5000k for oil change all the regular service was done to it ,Its never plowed snow or been off road or abused so there is no reason for the problems I have had"
319937,Gerry,2009-03-21 13:00:00,257,"Here’s my penny’s worth. Owing a truck is like everything else in life, its about compromises.  The new Dodge is a very nice looking truck and I looked into getting one last fall. I really like some of the new features like the dual tips and storage lockers in the box. But, that’s where it ended for me. The new coil spring system is one design feature that I am really suspect about. Yeah, they say that rail cars have coils and so do all of the racing cars, i.e. Nascar. Well, a truck isn’t a rail car and I’m not at Daytona every day. There’s a very good reason why trucks have leaf springs, and that’s to reduce sway. And sway is very important when towing something heavy.  I own a 2006 Ford F150, FX4, 5.4L. I bought it new and have about 75K kms. I’ve had no issues with it so far, and I tow the beast that you see in my sig. I do expect to run into some repairs as I get near or over the 100K mark, but based on many reliable sources, these should not be major ones.. The 5.4L isn’t as strong as the Hemi, but it’s easier on fuel. This is the compromise that I mentioned., smaller engine = less power and less fuel, bigger engine = more power and more fuel. The other issue is reliability....I believe Ford is more reliable than Dodge. Some posters have said that they have had good luck with their Dodges. My brother-in-law owns a 2003 Ram 1500 with the Hemi and he has had some major issues. Steering box early (40K), tranny, and finally the engine let go at about 140K kms among many other issues. I’ve also heard of many others complain about reliability with their Rams. If you’re the kind of guy who likes to grunt like Tim the Toolman Taylor, then by all means get the Hemi. Do expect however, that this will come at a price. There is only one situation that I wish I had more power and that is climbing the hill after getting on the 401 at Trenton. That 3 km hill while towing my heavy boat keeps my engine RPMs in the 4K range until I reach the top. Nowhere else do I need more power. So, do I accept the price on having to buy more fuel all of the time just to be able to have more power at my disposal for that 5 minute run? I think not.  But I really like the looks of the new Dodge.....life’s full of compromises."
319976,Tybo,2009-03-21 16:20:00,1373,I buy a truck for one reason. to pound the living hell out of them. At work we have use every truck out there. From 1500 to 650's we also have a couple of the internationals. My boss will only buy 2 brands now. Ford and GMC.
319985,Mattones,2009-03-21 16:42:00,587,"I am a PROUD owner of a 2009 Dodge Ram 1500 4x4 @ Peel Chrysler in Port Credit Sadly it didnt have the Side cubbies:(  Price was marked $28,995 -Regular $39.995. And i walked out with free mud flaps and a bed liner which was the dealers cost of $230+tax. I got a 7 year warrenty and over all walked out of there with a total price of $32,000.  only gave me a couple hundred for my Mazda. but hey thats alright saves me from trying to sell it."
319990,Billy Bob,2009-03-21 16:54:00,5865,Congratulations and enjoy the new sweet ride
319994,Mattones,2009-03-21 17:03:00,587,i had my father pull the rigg out as it was a tight squeeze and he just wanted to. he said he hardly hit the gas and it spun the tires he loves it. Man i am so pumped.  only problem is...  I am picking it up Tuesday evening and i have a leaf game at 7pm:P
320007,StoneFly,2009-03-21 17:52:00,574,"I Had the Exact Model, but it was a 2005, For 345 hp,..its actually not bad on Gas as long as your not pushing it.  My Buddy had the same year F150 and the Ram was way better on Gas and more powerful too."
320035,Billy Bob,2009-03-21 21:28:00,5865," The he|| with the Leafs, they are only going to lose unless they are playing the Sabres.....  Take that bad boy for a ride and break it in nice............"
320052,Mattones,2009-03-21 22:19:00,587,"Playing the caps. Always a great game. make sure i see then once a year play the leafs,  if parking wasent 20 bucks i would drive down."
320057,Greencoachdog,2009-03-21 22:29:00,8163," You done good Matt! What size engine and what ratio rear end did you get?... got any pics of her???  Going to to a new car/truck dealership to buy, is kinda like going into a room full of beautiful women... picking out the one you like and saying ""You're coming home with me!"""

320077,irishfield,2009-03-21 23:52:00,26272,Ummm.. which one did you get???  It don't come with a quick change and spare gear sets! lol  Congrats on the new ride.
320214,Billy Bob,2009-03-22 13:28:00,5865,With the class IV hitch and towing package I would be guessing 3:92  Edited to add:  Silver is a GREAT color. It always looks clean. This was my #1 option that my truck had to have when I purchased TUNDRA.
320218,Greencoachdog,2009-03-22 13:37:00,8163," Na, just being a 1/2 ton I'd say it's the 3:55 because it's 4WD.  I'd hate to have to feed that 3:92 gas hawg!!!"
320223,Billy Bob,2009-03-22 13:46:00,5865,"It could be either, Tundra has 4:30 rear end and a class IV hitch and it's a 4X4 1/2 ton truck."
320225,smokin joe,2009-03-22 13:49:00,226,"I'd have to guess that seeing no tow package involved it's probably the 3:92 ratio.  However I could be wrong, wouldn't be the first time"
320227,Billy Bob,2009-03-22 13:59:00,5865,I just checked by trying to build one on the Dodge site and it could be either 3:55 or 3:92 with the 5.7 L Hemi engine.  He didn't mention what model (Crew Cab or Regular Cab or whatever) so I used Quad Cab in the building. Don't know if that makes any difference with Dodge.  If it's the 3:92 it will cost in some mileage but there isn't a tow able boat out there he can't tow even through the mountains........   Edited to add: After taking another look on the Dodge site the 3:92 gears are a $375 OPTION so it would be listed on the window sticker I would think. So if not listed that beast has 3:55 gears.  Bob
320255,Mattones,2009-03-22 15:34:00,587,Its a Quad Cab with a tow package. I will find out everything when i get it on Tuesday. If its the 3:92 Bob then I guess I'll have to make some extra money by towing boats around for you guys. But knowing myself I will turn down the money just for a day of fishing. hahaha  Jepers! I am hiding this truck from my girlfriend until mid next week to make it surpirse when i pick her from the Go Station. But i keeping screwing up and talking about it. So hard to keep it to myself with being so thrilled.  http://www.trader.ca/powerpage/details.asp...mp;adid=7506445  Thats the tuck. Doesnt show much
320257,2 tone z71,2009-03-22 15:43:00,1311,"silvers good mine is silver also it grew on me,first thing I did was go get me some Rims haha  "
320325,Tybo,2009-03-22 18:47:00,1373," Low end tire hop is not a good trait of a pick up truck. This mean the tranny is not dispensing the toque properly and the frame is to rigged. It sounds like you bought the sports model.Great light to light,poor on highway and work. What is known as a Yuppy truck. It's not a bad thing. Only if you are towing or hauling close to the max weights.  I have this problem with my truck,but too different reasons.teehee,"
320358,GeorgeJ,2009-03-22 19:57:00,207,"I believe if it has the 20"" wheels the 3.92 will be standard because of their larger diameter."
319459,Mattones,2009-03-20 02:34:00,587,"I was given a great deal on  2009 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT, QUAD CAB, 4X4 5.7 Liter, 8 cyl. before i was given this deal on the truck I was about to buy a used 08 GMC Sierra for the same price. So now i'm stuck here thinking. For that price of the Sierra I could just buy a new Ram.  I googled the Ram 1500 and saw they are sort of horrible on gas..Maybe the worst? Is this true?  Any info on the Rams would be great  A few months ago I was wanting a Canyon but was told full size got better mpg and better on the engine. So i was better off going full size."
319464,2 tone z71,2009-03-20 02:46:00,1311,"had a Hemi Rental last yr ,it is a pig on gas,hard on trannys as well,I had a similiar deal last spring found the GM I wanted it was at a Ford dealer,did the credit app online for the GM salesman called said I can get ya in the same equipped supercrew from Ford New for less ,so I got the Ford,fantastic truck"
319466,walleyemaster,2009-03-20 02:53:00,325,"i own a dodge ram 1500 slt sport..20 inch rims..yes the truck is not great on gas..but none of the full size trucks are...i hit a deer last week with my truck and i have a rental truck ..its a sierra..the sierra is alot newer then my truck and drives nice..it burns the same amount of gas and one thing i know it does not have the horsepower of my ram..its a bit sluggish compared to my ram...plus i think that the ram looks way better then the sierra...the sierra still looks square like the trucks my dad drove in the 80s...also go new for the same price..this way you can break the truck in properly...i have never driven a ford, but i have driven many gm's...and this is the first dodge i have ever owned and i can tell you one thing..my ram has 220 000 kms and all i,ve had to replace was the belt, the brakes and the tires..so far so good....the gm's i've had always gave me problems.....and last but not least..all these trucks will be crap if you drive the crap out of them..if you take proper care of them... then you will get a great truck in return... hope this helped"
319468,jjcanoe,2009-03-20 02:57:00,744,I have a 2005 ram 5.7L hemi I get about 16MPG with a tonneau cover installed.  about 14MPg without.  Mine is older and doesn't have the MDS (shutting down 4cyl when city driving) so you could expect better mileage than I get.  As long as your not heavy on the pedal from start up you should be fine.  jjcanoe
319469,Garry2Rs,2009-03-20 02:58:00,1425,"I have a '97 5.2  (the old 318) with over 250,000K.  It's still runs like new.  I would order heavy-duty brakes next time, the Bass boat is heavier than the boat I had when I bought it...Other than that it's been a good truck.  I changed a water pump last year and a power steering pump about four years ago.  I have an oil cooler and a transmission cooler because I am always towing...It has a huge gas tank and makes about 600 klm between fill ups.  I think it works out to about 16 MPG empty and about 12 miles to the US gallon with the boat gassed and loaded, but it will haul it up any mountain in North America without complaining.  The 5.7 (the old 383) sounds like the Hemi to me.  If so, I believe it is, or can be, set up to run on 4 cylinders when not under load.  The gas mileage should be okay if your not on the loud pedal all the time.  2009's have an option of storage boxes in the box side rails on some models.  I liked the idea of being able to store rods out of sight...  The Fords and Chevy's are more popular and bring more at trade-in, but I will have mine until the wheels fall off so I'm not concerned."
319481,grt1,2009-03-20 03:34:00,638,"I've had them all, ford,chev and now dodge. In my opinion the dodge is the better truck, I love mine. It is a regular cab 4.7 litre V8 (not hemi) 4x4 and it has 137000 km on it  I get 20 - 22 mpg on the highway and 17 -19 around town. (little less in the winter due to warm up time). it is a solid truck and it rides great up here in the rough highway capital of ontario.  so far i've replaced the tires, brakes, a/c compressor and water pump.  if you choose the ram, i don't think you will be disappointed."
319491,xeon,2009-03-20 04:30:00,350,"I noticed this summer on the logging roads the dodges back end jumps around like mad and goes all over the road. I noticed ford seemed to be the better truck on those roads, followed by gm and then chevy. Dodge also seemed a bit worse on gas compared to the other two. Dodge does make a serious looking truck though."

I currently have a Dakota 4x4 with a 3.7 six cylinder, month to month it uses about $80 to $100 less on fuel but it's a lot less truck, back to a Ram with a Hemi when I'm ready to deal again, I think the extra in fuel is worth the extra comfort, not to mention all that intoxicating POWER!"
