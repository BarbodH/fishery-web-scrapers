320211,Fang,2009-03-22 13:11:00,1330,check out the close up at about 1:00 mark. Sure looks like a chinook salmon to me.
320216,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-22 13:31:00,10439,That's what the Ganny used to look like in the 80's.
320220,WeedLine,2009-03-22 13:42:00,322,those fish are salmon
320230,web-fisherman,2009-03-22 14:05:00,54,Nope - These are all Steelhead.
320248,solopaddler,2009-03-22 15:02:00,8605,"Yeah I stop by there occasionally for a look see when I'm down in PA. There's definitely no salmon there it's all steelhead.  Trout Run is where PA collects their eggs for their stocking program. (Unfortunately 'cause they're the grossest, mangiest strain of mutts I've ever seen  ).  Here's a couple of pic's I snapped last fall:    "

320784,web-fisherman,2009-03-23 17:05:00,54,Solopaddler - Those Pics are unbelievable. Thanks for posting.
320837,silvio,2009-03-23 19:12:00,433,I almost   my pants the first time I saw videos of trout run a few years ago. Its  a shame drifter is right the ganny use to get a huge run of steelhead when I was still in Bagdad. For the people that believe there salmon there not Erie doesn't support a great salmon fishery it does however support an amazing steelhead fishery especially state side. that video there is an example of when a government runs there fishery the way its supposed to and puts back the money they collected from licences and tags and other fishing related products. Also they donâ€™t spend 5 million dollars trying to introduce a new strain of fish especially when all the other salmon and trout strains are doing relatively poorly.
