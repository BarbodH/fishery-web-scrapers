319347,TDunn,2009-03-19 22:45:00,680,Wiley point eh....I was an employee for eagle lake island lodge and watsons pine portage out of wawa and buddy your in for a summer you wont forget.... My chum guided at wiley  ( soo college fish/wildlife  graduate) and said the beer flows quiet freely there...have a blast and save that cash.... If you want some tips I have had a few friends guide there PM me and i might be able to get you some gps cordinates for you before you even go...   TDunn   I took  a good course called super host before i did the fishing lodge thing....taught me a lot about how to treat guests and really teaches you how to make your tip money.....
319620,highdrifter,2009-03-20 17:01:00,2534,"Congratulations!!  I worked for Tomahawk myself...  You'll be working for their biggest competitors..  You'll be fishing Dog Bone Reef a lot..  If you take a family out, there's an island not far from there that has a nesting pair of bald eagles..  A good way to make an extra tip is to chuck a wounded perch close to the boat.  Tell the folk in your boat to sit still and get their cameras ready..  The sound of an eagle circling your boat to take a fish will make your jaw drop!!  Good luck out there and don't forget your maps.  I got lost more than once!!  Good luck dude!  HD"
319918,JFR,2009-03-21 11:06:00,498,"Congrats Matt......great gig,we'll miss your smiling face around town.  John and Diane Ross"
320275,tjsa,2009-03-22 16:52:00,1578," I may end up out there again this summer Fidel(if my bud's mother-in-law does not sell her island place), where is Dog Bone reef in relation to Wiley Point Lodge??  And yeah, bald eagles are flippin' everywhere on this lake. You can sometimes do a complete 180 degree lookabout and see 4-6 of them either flying around or sitting in a tree scanning the water.  Which lodges do Tomahawk operate, BTW??"
320277,Rich Clemens,2009-03-22 16:57:00,3131,That do indeed sound like a dream job.  Glad to hear you got the job you really wanted.   COngrats.

318501,pikeie,2009-03-17 17:22:00,380,The fish and wildlife Program at Sault College requires u to do a summer co-op somewhere that relates to the natural resources. I applied to plenty of fishing lodges and heard back from a few but last week I got a call from the ONE that I wanted to work at! So it looks like I will be working up at Totem Resorts on LAKE OF THE WOODS lol in Souix Narrows for the summer!! I’ll be working at one of the outposts called Wiley Point; I can’t wait to get up there for the summer! I’ll be working as a dock hand for the most part but they said I should get plenty of guiding hours under my belt too.  Just thought id share
318506,steve_paul,2009-03-17 17:31:00,658,"Congrats, sounds like a great way to spend the summer  Looking forward to the reports"

318514,ccmtcanada,2009-03-17 17:54:00,7971,"I don't usually get jealous....  But I am now!!  To be young again, with opportunities like that!"
318523,Radnine,2009-03-17 18:14:00,1538,"Congratulations!! A great score. This is like the kid who dreams of flying landing his first job as a ramp rat (aviation reference for Wayne). Like the guys said, take lots of pictures and remember to keep copies of any favourable press from guests or employers, for your portfolio. Enjoy!! Jim"
318542,trapshooter,2009-03-17 19:36:00,1234,"Congratulations.  Working at a lodge and guiding changed my life - for the better - in many ways.  If I can offer some advice - invest in some quality rain gear.  Gore-tex if you can afford it.  You will be spending a lot of time outside, rain and shine, and it's miserable to be wet under your outerwear.   Oh yeah, and sunscreen... apply multiple times daily.  I was a fool my first summer and rarely used any and I did some real damage to my face and hands.  Polarized glasses - buy them and wear them 100% when fishing/guiding even if it's raining or cloudy.  I had a jig come loose from a guests fish and the jig shot up and hit me in the glasses.  I would have lost my eye if I wasn't wearing my glasses.  All the guides at my lodge do the same.  Good luck and have fun.  If you have any other questions about guiding or working for lodges, don't hesitate to ask."
318544,tinbanger,2009-03-17 19:39:00,1028,"Glad you posted , been bustin a gut holding in that news.  Now get me that shopping list so I can sepnd spend some money on tackle , er ""education supplies"" for you.    A proud dad. TB"
