So, what is the best way you can talk someone to ask about fishing on private propery?  I ask as there is a river close to me that I see guys fishing when the opener hits but it is fenced off with signs up.  I want to try and contact the land owner so I can fish there too, and clean up as I leave (the others have left a mess in the past).  So what is the best way to find out who the land owner is and ask them?  Thanks in advance.  Geoff"
