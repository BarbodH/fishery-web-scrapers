320399,todd,2009-03-22 21:48:00,8,I have fished big creek alot. Right now its loaded with chrome. Its only open from lyndock down to the lake . After the opener start right at the dam in delhi.I go down a couple of back roads and hit my favorite holes about midway. Opening day there can be a fair amount of guysthere. after thaat you can pretty much have the place to yourself. good luck to ya.
