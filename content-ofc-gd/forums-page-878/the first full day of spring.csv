320254,Terry,2009-03-22 15:29:00,14456,"Well Saturday was the first full day of spring  and they say a young mans thoughts turn to  something but not being young I just thought about fishing  I decided that going out on the ice may not be a good idea, so I dug out the folding boat found all the peices and off I went to the river for some crappie or pike or whatever wanted to bite my hook got it in the water     and off I went, I was a little worried as I had to use it as an ice breaker, I wasn't concerned about the boat but wondered if the small electric could push me through it... well it was just a bit that iced over night and pushed through no problem     I tried fishing a lot of areas but got skunked and it was colder then it looked and my hands and feet were freezing but it was the first of many fishing trips for 2009    I had trouble getting back to where I launched the boat, the motor would only work in reverse, turns out the shear pin broke, so the prop spun, but in reverse it would pust against itself and hold enough to get me home..  now it's time to get my big boat home......"
320261,irishfield,2009-03-22 15:54:00,26272,Man what a nice boat...
320263,Terry,2009-03-22 16:03:00,14456,it sure is I got a great deal on it too
320269,Dondorfish,2009-03-22 16:22:00,1000,"Always liked that boat Terry - will it take a small gas motor?  Got any pictures of it folded up? And lastly, what does it weigh?  I think I know where you were - not saying - but from what I hear of all reports - was pretty slow - maybe a week or 2 early!  Thanks for the report  Don  "
320274,Terry,2009-03-22 16:49:00,14456,"it's a secret river in Bradford...LOL and I think it's a bit early for them, soon          here is a link about the boat..I have a 2.5hp  and a 5hp for it    http://www.ontarioportableboats.com/catalo...251/4194917.htm"
320280,Beans,2009-03-22 17:02:00,3339,Methinks you were on the other side of the river...the other side of the bridge...  
320287,tjsa,2009-03-22 17:13:00,1578,"I wish I could have afforded to buy that boat 2 yrs. ago, just was not in the cards back then, nor now,"
320289,Dondorfish,2009-03-22 17:15:00,1000,Thanks Terry - that is one very interesting boat!  Don  
320328,misfish,2009-03-22 18:56:00,29133,"BPS has them now.They aint cheap.  Norm,theres going to be some pretty upset people when they drive all the way up there and see that.    Why Terry,am I not surprised that yer outing came with complications??????????????LOL Always an adventure."
320340,Leecher,2009-03-22 19:32:00,7832,Cool boat Terry     Sounds like you had a good time out there!! Thanks for posting the pics Leechman
320342,Joey,2009-03-22 19:40:00,9122,"Well I know exactly where you were Terry  Nice day to be out, a tad windy tho, but better than on the ice that's for sure.  Joey"
320348,Beans,2009-03-22 19:45:00,3339, Brian...If my memory serves me they take that fence down in the spring and put it back up late fall...
320355,Terry,2009-03-22 19:51:00,14456,"the fence is still up and the dock is sinking into the river  misfish you are right, things do happen around me, makes life interestsing"
320425,bassjnkie,2009-03-22 22:54:00,1101,"The old owner of the dock/property sold it, let's see if the new one will let us fish there."
320675,irishfield,2009-03-23 13:54:00,26272,"Don... I run a 5HP 4 stroke Honda on mine. Terry got a hell of a deal on that boat, that never even saw the water before I sold it to him. Most comfortable boat I've ever owned and fished from.... and that still stands!"
320676,Victor,2009-03-23 13:55:00,1609,"thanks for the report terry, I'm planning to make a trip up there soon too. Just can't wait till the crappie starts biting..."
