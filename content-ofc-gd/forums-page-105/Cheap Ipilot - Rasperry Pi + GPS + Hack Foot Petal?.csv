Of course I bought mine last year and the bluetooth upgrade looks like Minn Kota offers no way to upgrade.   I got to thinking that it might be possible just to hard wire into the foot petal and let a raspberry pi with GPS and bluetooth addon unit control it.  And then perhaps custom Android apps could database more than 5 spotlocks etc. and make for a nice GUI for easier control.  My Python is pretty rusty but there is a ton of canned code available...  hmmm. just a thought, maybe could even poll quicker gps for a tighter spotlock.  JUST THINKING OUT LOUD.    "

Too busy building cabins, fishing rods, tying flies. When you get it all worked out let me know, I'll try it on my Powerdrive V1 TM."
991128,Raycaster,2017-01-14 16:02:00,528,Talking with another tech friend and he pointed out why not eliminate the whole raperberry pi from the equation and just use bluetooth relays contolled from a tablet or phone with gps already available.  So a foot pedal connector to a waterproof enclosed $50 8 bank bluetooth relay with some canned android code would be a simple start.  The terrova runs on 24v with a 60A breaker so I need to check whats running through the pedals and find out about the speed setting beyond using the gps to determine it.
