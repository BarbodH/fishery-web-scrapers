Or more specifically to this discussion, how the hell Trudeau's carbon tax is going to affect that rise. (Answer: it will have zero impact on warming or CO2 levels, the only thing it's going to impact is our pockets).  It's all related HF. PPM (parts per million) of C02 is directly related to world temperature increase. To climate scientists it couldn't be more obvious, but hey they love studying problems. Those clever scientists have determined that a 2 degree increase of global world temperatures would be bad-bad-bad for everyone. That is the point where doing nothing, as you suggest, becomes a lot more more costly then doing something. We are close to breaching that level...which is about 500 ppm    If you are with me so far then the Carbon tax was Canada's solution to live up to our responsibilities of the Paris accord, where incredibly all the countries of the world came together and agreed how to solve this problem. When you can get the worlds biggest polluter to agree and make major changes to lower it's ppm you have accomplished something, especially when that country is China. So no, I completely disagree with you, this is a big Damn deal and it will have a huge impact on C02 levels and global warming.  You can whine all you want about how Wynne and Trudeau IMPLEMENT things and cost you more tax dollars then necessary, and I wouldn't disagree with you there, but their goal to work with the rest of the world on this problem is intelligent and responsible. If you want those two leaders out of office it would be important to be cognizant of the biggest problem facing the world today and more importantly, have a better solution. One way I could see the Liberals staying in power would be for the PCs to continue to be ignorant on the issue, with no policy or plan. As climate events become more extreme reasonable people will never vote for a party that is clueless on this issue. "

I work on a coke ovens battery and the days of letting the ovens emitt smoke are gone and with good reason.

You think this won't happen with the Libs new carbon tax?  Remember when they brought in the fishing licenses and how they said all funds generated form sales of them would go to the MNR? Also remember that they didn't tell us all existing funding was being stripped so they could use it elsewhere. The net result was the MNR funding decreased because the license fees were less than the original funding. We all though the license fees were a great thing because the MNR would have way more money to protect the resource, stocking etc. Yeah, we were all taken.  And now there's that missing $70,000,000.

What makes those who don't want to pay for upkeep so extra special? A winning personality?  If your beef is with who is spending the money and how it is spent then that is a political issue. If you believe Wynne and Trudeau to be incapable of doing this right then remember they got elected with majorities which means the alternative was unappealing. Get involved and help the party of your preference choose leaders who are financially and socially capable. We need good leaders who can reach out to all with the best plan going forward.

Historically, before unions, workers had very limited rights entrenched in legislation. Unions brought those issues to the fore front and eventually into legislation. Since we now have workers rights entrenched, the usefulness of unions has passed. IMHO - unions do nothing but protect the weak and unwilling.

We at one time had as many ""workers"" from across the plant at the Hall as the entire number of workers in my dept.  That didn't include H&S reps on steady days in the plant.

Do we have 97% of the members of this board agreeing with the experts? Nope. Unfortunately this is not an issue you can happily be ignorant about and no cares. The earth is our one shared ride in this universe so it's your RESPONSIBILITY to become truly educated on this topic. Just as if you had to share a ride to work and a fellow passenger told you the car is leaking lots of braking fluid...you can happily ignore him and the car will continue to exist in one form or the other but you have a responsibility to the people who are in that car.  Therefore, when fellow members obviously post images and bogus assertions from DENIER websites to create doubt I have no problem calling those images and assertions. I do so in a visual way because there is no better way to do that then with expert graphs. If you don't like all the graphs all I can say is toughtitties.  If you truly think that I and 97% of the experts in the field are wrong, by all means enlighten us Hedfish. If I am wrong I'll gladly apologize.  Once a large majority of the members understand that this is a hucking fuge problem that we must tackle I'll gladly talk taxes.

For whatever reason they can't accept what the scientific community in this field has concluded with as much certainty as the theory of evolution, and even that the earth is round.

If you do worry about your kids then worry about solid predictions that sea levels will rise 6-9 ft in their life time. You want to talk about economic hardship for your kids?

Second, it's reporting on a piece by the Fraser Institute. The following information may help you to understand the Fraser Institute's motivations.  Catherine Windels is the Director of International Affairs at international drug giant Pfizer, and also served as the Secretary Treasurer for the Fraser Institutes Board of Trustees. The Fraser Institute has put out several ""reports"" critical of internet pharmacies and generic drugs, and has lobbied for direct to consumer advertising by drug companies. All things that would benefit Pfizer.  Then there's Gwyn Morgan (of oil company EnCana) and R. J. Pirie (Sabre Energy). They are on the board too. Oh and the Koch brothers, those conservative American oil billionaires, they gave $500,000 to the Fraser Institute. Actually Exxon gave them $120,000 too, seems like all the oil guys want to get in bed with Fraser. Perhaps that is why the Fraser Institute are essentially climate change deniers.  You may have read recently, as I did, that corporations are sitting on record amounts of cash. Interestingly, the Fraser Institute supports cutting corporate taxes. Perhaps they think the corporations need more cash. I wonder if that has anything to do with board members Peter Brown (Cannacord Capital) and James McGovern (Arrow Hedge Partners). These guys control hedge funds with investments of approximately $300M for the ultra rich.  I'm sure there's more, the board is actually huge.  I'm not sure why anyone who isn't filthy rich would think the Fraser Institute would ever do anything for them. They don't care about regular people at all. They use big corporate money and a rag like the Sun to convince the ""working man"" that they've got your back.  While I didn't do the research, I'm sure the Liberals are just as bad on the other side. Google Mike Crawley, former President of the Liberal Party of Canada. He started a power company (despite no prior experience) and received a 20 year guaranteed contract to provide green energy to the Ontario Liberals. The payout? A paltry $66,000 per day.  The point is these guys have all read Sun Tzu, and as long as they keep us divided into liberal or conservative tribes, we will remain conquered."

Now Mr. O'leary who I don't believe is going to run anyway, wants to run gov. like a business. What business gives away 100 billion in income? So O'Leary = 100 billion increase in taxes, see what the tar sands thinks of that.  I think Trudeau used the word eventually. Economics slows down the tar sands every few years when the price of oil drops to where they can't compete, anyone who has lived in Fort McMurry long has experienced this.

This is well documented. My statement was not anti-immigration, not sure where you got that. My question was who is going to take on the burden of paying for these folks. When they arrived, the feds said they would fund them for a year. That year has passed and to the best of my knowledge, only 10% have found jobs. There are various valid reasons for the lack of jobs, but that in no way takes away from the fact that the feds have basically down loaded the cost of carrying these people to the provinces and municipalities. As you so aptly put it, look it up! Last time I checked, Ontario is already struggling to meet it's current obligations. HH"
991503,Dutch01,2017-01-17 17:03:00,1431,"When you say who is paying the cost, you are missing the point. On the whole, immigration returns more to Canada than it costs us.  On the flipside, stopping immigration because of an erroneous perception that it costs us money, would actually have the reverse of the intended effect. Canadians are not having enough children to sustain our tax base. Without immigrants' contribution to Canada, the government would have to cut social programs further, or run higher deficits."

Harper was bringing about 25-30,000 refugees per year with 200,000 immigrants Basically the same as all of the Lieberal policies adhering to Conservative initiatives including health care transfers to provinces.  The only difference is that Trudeau had to do it with a bunch of fan fare and celebration to make himself look like a hero. The problem is he did it all at once and clogged the system instead of gradually throughout the year so they could be properly taken care of.

My $0.02 worth is to note that Harper also had a plan to phase out the tar sands.  His timeframe was much longer than the current gov't, by 2100 was the previous plan.  Had a quick look but couldn't find a date for the current gov't but I did hear on the news the other night that it was shorter/sooner.  Conservatives had 2030 for phase out of coal and current Liberals have chosen to stick with this."
991516,Headhunter,2017-01-17 17:52:00,5703,"So Ontario is broke due to miss-management. I think we can all agree on that! How does dumping tens of thousands of people onto the province and municipalities welfare roll, equate to making Canada a thriving country? You do realize that the government of Canada uses population numbers as ""collateral"" with the IMF to secure credit ratings? Each one of us is collateral against loans. Had the fed liberals taken some time to organize and prepare for the influx of new people, ie setting up ESL classes upon arrival vs screwing around for months on end, we might not be looking at the numbers we are seeing on welfare rolls. Anyone want to consider why the feds moved the cabinet around? Could it be because the immigration portfolio was so poorly administered? HH"
991518,scuro2,2017-01-17 18:27:00,904,"I agree there is a problem, what I want to know is: How is taxing Canadians to the point where they have to decide between eating and freezing is going to solve the problem? Do you understand that as a senior in Ontario I get $578.53 a month in pension, I have lived worked and paid taxes here since I was 15 years old and I am now 71. $578.53 doesn't even cover my heating but our wonderful leaders can give billions of $ to other countries because they are poor?  I'm not asking you to do anything. It would be foolish to ask our seniors to be the solution to this problem. Seniors are better informed and more active then any other segment of our population and will lead us by example.  As I said before, global warming is a real and obvious problem, with an obvious horribly bad outcome, and it has an obvious solution. Simply the world has to decrease our C02 output in aggregate. If we don't do that then the world as we know it will no longer function properly and money will lose most of it's real value.  We have one problem but there are many ways to solve this problem. A lot of members think that solving this problem requires them to completely change their lives. It doesn't. People can make changes to their lives but what is needed is societal changes which requires government.  I'd put Trudeau and Wynne more in the category of understanding the problem but not executing the best solution. Would we solve this problem simply by first eliminating the world's burning of coal, which is the most dirty of fossil fuels? It would be a great first and may be final step. By no means is the only solution or necessarily the best solution, but take our best minds and have them determine a solution. Then have politicians ONLY implement their plan. When the will of the people is unified politicians will do whatever the people want."

I am pretty sure that HeadHunter meant refugees.  I assume that the net benefit of a refugee is less than the net benefit of an immigrant; although it may still be positive.  Having said that, the point of bringing refugees into Canada is entirely different from the point of immigration.

We have some sharp people here on OFC that articulate well. Lets think tank a few solutions here.  I think our immigration policies should mirror the policies of the last century. Just as both sets of my Grand Parents who emigrated to the US and Canada as far back as 1917 they needed a sponsor that took full responsibility for their welfare in order to get past Ellis Island or Halifax. Simple, the Gov. pays not one nickel to an immigrant. The sponsor houses them, feeds, clothes them all and lines up employment and education for them. Too simple to work again?  Refugees are a different form of immigration. The Gov will rescue them so we Canucks can get a warm and fuzzy feeling and brag about our compassion when we go away on vacations outside the country. Of course I have a story. Flying home from Amsterdam in business class the man next to me is dressed to the nines in 98'. The flight attendant asked me to give him his declaration slip when he woke.

I don't know if I buy that.  Based on the amount of C02 I don't emit here in Ontario or Quebec I get a carbon credit. You on the other hand are polluting somewhere in California. You in Cali. can buy carbon credits from me in Quebec so you the California guy can keep polluting without investing the money you don't have to improve your systems. I don't pollute as much in Quebec and you do in California, I have credits to sell you. So the incentive is to not pollute so you can bank credits to sell for $$. If all goes well emissions to atmosphere is reduced or remain neutral at the least. That's what I get from all the gibberish. I may be way off base but why would I invest millions for new systems to reduce emissions if I can just pay someone else far less money than the capital expenditure for improvements will be. The new Blast Furnace Gas cleaning system and Casthouse bag house built in the early 90's came in at 20 million if I remember right. I can check that number. We are talking huge dollars. There has to be a maximum number of credits that can be bought, I don't know. Is there?  It is far too complicated for me to fully get my head around.

991272,Tom S,2017-01-15 21:24:00,362," Global warming is here, is impacting the world now, and temperature increases are accelerating. The consensus of experts in that field predict outcomes from a range of bleak to the end of the world as we know it.  One can always come up with an excuse to do nothing... to shirk responsibility. That might be less of an issue with something like say old age security where say family should be somewhat responsible, but you're on OUR giant space vehicle. What makes those who don't want to pay for upkeep so extra special? A winning personality?  If your beef is with who is spending the money and how it is spent then that is a political issue. If you believe Wynne and Trudeau to be incapable of doing this right then remember they got elected with majorities which means the alternative was unappealing. Get involved and help the party of your preference choose leaders who are financially and socially capable. We need good leaders who can reach out to all with the best plan going forward.  Something to keep in mind is that humanity loves to come up with scenarios that lead to the end of the world, just try to think of a time period after 1950 when something or another wasn't going to destroy humanity. Whether it was A-bombs, H-bombs, energy crisis, various diseases, Y2K, ozone layer depletion and so on. Does it mean these are not things to be taken seriously? No, but remember even through all these crises have come and gone we are still here.  Saying that, I believe that we do have to take some sort of action to be more responsible with regards to the environment, but also that we shouldn't handicap our economy and punish ourselves to make ourselves feel like we are doing something.  Those 3rd world countries pumping out pollution are often in the unfortunate position of either being able to eat or cut back on emissions. I know that if it was my family who depended on that job to provide food I wouldn't be thinking twice about it. Here in the Western world we are in a privileged position of being able to fret over issues like this, as we have food in our bellies, good healthcare, free time our our hands, and extra money.  I think that a better approach would have been to promote moderation and cutting back with incentives, rather than taxing everyone. Additional taxes are only going to hurt the most vulnerable people who cannot stretch a fixed income.  Please don't insinuate that Wynne and Trudeau were elected because the majority of Ontarians & Canadians thought they were the best leaders. Wynne got in because the Conservatives ran a terrible campaign and basically handed the election to her, and Trudeau got in because it turned into a popularity contest. Hopefully in the elections to come other parties will be able to focus on financial and social capabilities as well as accountability, and hopefully we as the voters will be able to focus on these issues as we cast our ballots."

991385,scuro2,2017-01-16 20:49:00,904,If you have a better way to reduce carbon emissions please share. It's an easily understandable problem with a basic solution. Gripping about politicians or how this is unsolvable does nothing.A common belief on this board seems to be that the bulk of CO2 emissions come from 3rd world countries. They don't. We can't use the excuse that nothing should be done because this is a third world problem which typically are unsolvable because this is a myth. It's our problem. The burning of coal in the US and China is a major source of CO2. Cement production is a significant source CO2 because of the high temperatures needed. Check out the excellent CO2 website linked below. You can easily see which countries create the most CO2http://www.globalcarbonatlas.org/en/CO2-emissions

991456,Dutch01,2017-01-17 05:09:00,1431,"Trudeau's comments really weren't that inflammatory, and the (over)reaction is much ado over nothing.  It's obvious that we will *eventually* have to stop burning fossil fuels. The people crying now about having to choose between having to eat or heat are being a little bit selfish, frankly. I work for a living too and it's hard to pay the bills sometimes so I'm not speaking from on high.  But have a little perspective.  Every member on this board is in the top 5% or so of the world in quality of life and income.  We have multiple cars, 2,3,4000 square foot houses, lakefront  cottages, boats and the list goes on ad infinitum. Meanwhile, most of the population of Kiribati in the Pacific have had to move to another island as theirs is now underwater. If we don't change our polluting ways future generations aren't going to be worrying about heat or food, they'll be worrying about being able to breath.  It's a common refrain among generally conservative politicians that running up debt is bad finance and unfair to future generations. Fair enough, I accept that premise. How ironic then, to fight any and all attempts to protect those same future generations' environment. We are cashing in lives in the future* for jobs now. I don't think that is right.  * Not just in the future, people die from air pollution every day now.  Do I think that this new carbon tax is the right solution? Not personally, no. But the wailing and moaning by the conservatives every time Trudeau speaks is too much. They're like a jilted Democrat on Donald Trump night.  Rachel Notley of all people had the most rational and reasonable response I saw:    ""We have to remember, this is coming from a prime minister who's just approved not one but two pipelines that are going to assist in our diversifying the markets to which we sell the product coming from the oilsands,"" Notley told CBC Radio's The House.  She cautioned Albertans not to get ""too excited"" about Trudeau's comments.  I'm with her on this one."

This new crap and trade tax that was supposed to only add $5.00 a month to the average heating bill; well my first propane bill was 20% higher then the previous one (on a cost/L) When I called my supplier they explained that not only was there the extra tax but their costs to deliver it had also gone up so they had to pass that along too.

Having been a small business owner that had to call Uncle in 2008 if I had a cash infusion of $30,000.00 a year in non repayable Federal support funding the 10 people that lost their jobs may still be working for us. That's only 3K per worker per year. It works out to $25.00 per worker per month for only 10 employees. Less with more than we had if our 5 year plan came to fruition with 20 workers, $12.50 each per month. It sure cost the Feds much more than 25 bucks a month per person collecting Employment Insurance and back then it was extended well beyond 26 weeks. I don't consider that neither a waste or a massive amount of $$$ rolling in. I call it a smart investment in our workers by Taxpayers.  Netminder 60% employment cost for a any business no mater the size budget is far too high, even for a unionized shop. When I finished my Batch of Commerce degree at Brock after I retired they drove in the fact that 40% is the number that gets you to CCAA. 30% will keep you in the competitive ball park maybe.

990922,bushart,2017-01-13 02:48:00,2628,Thanks Liverelease  I thought maybe things have changed here at OFC with the rule changes---but your one sided political view  has proven that hyper partisan is alive and well  I will check in again in 6 months or so and see if grown ups are here  Good Luck Art......hate and Bull is a hard fight.......take care brother---see ya.
990923,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-13 03:06:00,8243,"Live, that's a good one. I'm going to  mod q myself before I get impeached before Trump does. Can they impeach a Prez. elect before he takes the oath of office?  By the way Art (I know you are here) what does mod q stand for. I assume it's short for Moderator, what's the ""q"" represent?"

Carbon taxes, he's trying to impose a tax on streaming video. Pretty sure he's going to try and tax your bowel movements too!!! OH, and he's legalizing marijuanna so he can tax that too."

What do you expect hes nothing more than a high school drama teacher in a rush to get us to a trillion in dept all while chasing away industry with his over the top policies.  Bash trump but he will eat trudeau alive, Hopefully in four years we will elect someone with a business education and experience to fight for jobs"

Therefore we need business men and women not politicians in control. I lived in Mississauga most of my life and Hurricane Hazel new how to get it done with out racking up taxes and debt!!!"

He talked to Wynne and she assured him no one can afford to turn on their computers...at least between 7am and 7pm.
990971,Beans,2017-01-13 14:47:00,3339,"Oh leave Cliff alone, he,s chill,n in the new crib.  Besides that he is celebrating his birthday today on Friday the 13th...Or hopefully he is up at Tim Hales..."
990998,ch312,2017-01-13 17:01:00,1590,"Well, anything is better than Harper! (Or Trump)  Sure, if you enjoy being taxed to death, laid off because your employer fled the country due to high operating costs and seeing billions of dollars tossed away for literally nothing.  It's a bloody joke that our PM is nothing more than a drama teacher who got in because his fathers past and he bought votes with marijuana. Next lieberal hairbrained idea for our disgrace of a province (that's right, the rest of the country despises ON) is $22k for every working age adult which will only cost a measly $170 billion per year.    Here's to hoping the ice is thin and he's wearing a pair of concrete shoes."
991007,netminder,2017-01-13 17:34:00,514,"Labour accounts for 60% of corporate expenses. I wonder where a ""businessman"" would start cutting if he were PM. Great way to bring jobs to the country....  And while parliament isn't in session, I don't know how much ""work"" a PM can do. part of politicking is getting your face out there amongst the masses and taking the temperature of the electorate, not hiding away in an office avoiding press and exposure. If we weren't constantly reminded, I bet many Canadians would have forgot what Harper looked like. Accountability? Sure. How many press conferences was Harper available for that he didn't march out on because he didn't like the questions being asked? His very first press conference as PM he threw a hissy fit because he couldn't mandate which reporters could ask him questions.  Just thought I'd throw that in there before this gets locked."
991008,Weeds,2017-01-13 17:35:00,782,Nothing good ever comes out of these political threads. Ever. Maybe the occasional good one liner but beyond that.....
