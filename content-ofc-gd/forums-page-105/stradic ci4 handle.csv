990493,chong,2017-01-09 01:52:00,102,"The  knob on my stella is getting sticky and I would like to change it, Does anyone know if it would fit and where I can get the knob?  "
990499,GBW,2017-01-09 02:12:00,8460,In theory it should fit as long as they are both the same size body.  Not too much to change there in technology wise but Shimano has a warranty and service location in Peterborough you can look up and contact.  There should be others local too in QC but I just know my local one...
990610,chong,2017-01-10 01:28:00,102,thanks i'll give them a call
990614,GBW,2017-01-10 01:59:00,8460,"thanks i'll give them a call No worries, did you try the other one to see if it fit?"
990617,Lape0019,2017-01-10 02:15:00,647,"I don't know if the handle will fit but the knob itself should. And yeah, you should be able to order it online or through the Peterborough warranty centre. If you want, there are many aftermarket brands as well. Check out hedgehog studios for aftermarket ones"

990705,bare foot wader,2017-01-10 22:08:00,1354,"the knob itself is removable, tiny roller bearing that you can either degrease/relube or replace just the bearing if needed (might be a bushing if you have a vintage model)  which model stella do you have? it's easy to do, should be some youtube videos I'm sure"
990731,chong,2017-01-11 02:28:00,102,I don't want to deal with shiman au peche.  I have the stella 2500 FD.
990755,Lape0019,2017-01-11 13:49:00,647,"I don't blame you there.  Local dealer used to send all reels to that place. Any Shimanos he gets in for cleanings are now sent directly to Shimano for a specific reason. It's more costly but the work is great.  If the knob is the actual issue, Bare foot wader is 100% correct. There really isn't much you can screw up underneath a know. If you want to get a bearing for it, you can again order through Shimano or go check out the Boca bearings site. Knob bearings are super cheap.  3rd option would be to send the whole reel in for a cleaning and mention that the knob is not as free moving as it used to be."

It will feel like new and you will love it even more if you go route 3..."
990788,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-11 20:28:00,8243,"I have had a stiff knob for years on my Shimano 1500. My mechanical skills for miniscule tasks are not the best. Fat fingers and poor eye sight. I give it a shot of machine oil occasionally. It is around 20 years old and it doesn't owe me anything, I love it because of the rear drag, those 1500 and 2500 series are built like Sherman tanks. Not for finesse fishing. Try giving her a shot of a good quality machine oil."
990789,manitoubass2,2017-01-11 20:31:00,11391,With that reel id do option 3 no doubt!
990791,musky_hunter,2017-01-11 21:24:00,328,where u? i got some that would fit.
990799,chong,2017-01-12 02:34:00,102,"I'm in Montreal.  The handle it not stiff at all, it's the rubber handle itself that is getting sticky.( I think I fish too much....not)  I'm going to send it in to have it cleaned and ask to have the knob changed."
990801,NANUK,2017-01-12 04:18:00,797,"Try cleaning it with rubbing alcohol, Happened to one of my reels, bug spray on my hands was the culprit."
990810,Lape0019,2017-01-12 13:30:00,647,"Ah!  Yes, the Septon grips can get a little sticky. Try the alcohol but if that doesn't work, go back to changing the knobs."
991001,bare foot wader,2017-01-13 17:16:00,1354,"oh, so the actually grip itself is sticky to touch? my bad, a new bearing won't fix that lol  if cleaning it doesn't work, there is a good number of aftermarket options if you want to bling your reel, you don't have to stick with the factory septon knob, unless of course you like it"
991011,GBW,2017-01-13 17:37:00,8460,If you want to bling it out and have it serviced up nice then I'd PM cdnbasshunter as that is a joy/passion of his from everything I've ever seen of his posts involving reels.
