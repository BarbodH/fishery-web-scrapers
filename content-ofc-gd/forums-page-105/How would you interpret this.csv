A CO says the area is closed to fishing but I don't understand, in other places they list sanctuaries where I understand its closed This says zero limit, not closed"
991956,G.mech,2017-01-19 21:56:00,830,"'Zero limit"" means you can target the fish but C&R only.  Closed means no targeting of that species or no fishing at all in the case of a sanctuary.  The zero limit is covered on the top right corner of page 7 of the regs which reads: "

991961,G.mech,2017-01-19 22:00:00,830,"   Even at zero possession, you can still practice C&R legally."
991990,Dara,2017-01-20 00:34:00,3052,Thanks. That's what I figured. This area has a river running into it that is a sanctuary but it's in a different zone due to lake George St Mary's river being Great Lakes zone  It has always been known as a sanctuary and nobody fishes it but the wording is just wrong. Last night a friend was at his fish club meeting and a CO was visiting to answer questions  My friend asked this and the CO was adamant that charges would be laid for anybody fishing there  Oh well. Can't fight city hall as they say Michigan is 1000 yards away and legal
992076,BillM,2017-01-20 14:03:00,17367,"If it was a sanctuary it would have stated that in the regs.  The fact that it says a 0 possession limit means you can still fish for them, but they need to be released."
992077,AKRISONER,2017-01-20 14:12:00,5558,they have a similar rule in Parry Sound Harbour for lake trout. The season is open but the limits are 0 between a certain period.
992144,zenon11,2017-01-20 17:40:00,75,What if you gut hook the fish and kill it? Are you obligated to put it back dead (therefore violating the laws regarding wasting meat) or keep it and get busted for fishing for the fish out of season?
992147,BillM,2017-01-20 18:00:00,17367,"It goes back, dead or not."
992148,manitoubass2,2017-01-20 18:01:00,11391,Ive asked a co this when confronted about keeping an OOS bass (ughhh)  Its up to the CO to make that call.  I was fine because I covered my butt with a picture of a leadhead jig caught in the fishes gills and bleeding badly.  He said that was a good idea.
992150,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-20 18:21:00,8243,"Not every CO knows the regs. completely, or they interpret them differently than other CO's. Just like every Cop doesn't know every law they are enforcing. That's why we have nearly 1 lawyer for every 10 citizens within a 45 minute drive of our county."
992153,AKRISONER,2017-01-20 18:45:00,5558,the fish dies im putting it back in the lake if my limit is zero. i might at least cut the swim bladder out of it to ensure that it sinks rather then letting the turd hawks eat it.

I'm guessing if you put a knife to it and a CO see's you, charges will be laid. No matter how honorable the intentions.  My son just bought a drone...that thing flies high and you can't hear it in the wind so don't ever think you are alone"
992209,G.mech,2017-01-20 23:42:00,830,"Here is the link to the 200 'Ask a CO' questions and answers from the Ministry.   I don't feel like going through them all again but somewhere in there it says a slot size or out of season fish must be released regardless of its condition.  Again, not trying to make sense of it or defend it but that's what the answer was.  http://www.outdoorontario.net/AskMNR/mnrfaqfish.html   Edit:  Slow morning at G.mech's house so I waded through the Q&A's and found this in Q#168:   Also, many of these questions are quite old but I think most of the interpretations are still valid.  I did however notice a couple of specific questions around bait, moving live fish, limits, & sanctuaries etc  that are outdated due to some regulation changes....."
