991110,limeyangler,2017-01-14 07:17:00,5204,"Hi all,  Our annual trip to the tropics is next weekend, two weeks with my family, my mum and dad, and various guests (old family friends) that show up at my brother in law's house there over the month period my parents stay there as hosts.  This year we are taking one of my son's best friends and class mate, so apart from my duty as chef for the two weeks ( I do a full course meal for up to 10 every night….really awesome evenings) I should get plenty of fishing in, and i'm packing my gear accordingly  Last year was a hoot as always, but more fish, big ones too, got off than were landed. A number of reasons for this 1. Tarpon are master escapologists    2. My knots were not up to the task   3.  Coral makes short work of braid.  So this year my gear has evolved again as it does every year, and although I'm sticking with braid I am trying some Tuf-Line braid in unto 80lb( big diameter mono does not afford the distance I need casting light lures into the strong easterly Antiguan wind). I have three reels with me and three rods to cover heavy and medium heavy actions with lure weights upto 4.5 oz.  I have been practicing some knots and am in love with the FG Knot for braid to fluorocarbon, and various loop knots to tie direct to the lures ( learnt a tough lesson using snap swivels that get easily bent out!)  Hooks for live bait (xxx strong), some bobbers, some sabiki bait catchers, and even some heavy sinkers to try night fishing there for the first time.  I have a bunch of soft baits and hard baits, predominantly in pearl/pink colours as these have worked the best for me in recent years, even some small twister tails for the Lookdown Pompano and other small 'Jacks' that are around.  I've posted some pictures of what I,m taking below as I usually see posts on here around this time of year from people heading to Cuba etc…asking questions about fishing opportunities and what tackle to take, might help someone get an idea of what to use.  In terms of packing it might seem a lot but most airlines allow you take take fishing tackle as long as the rods are in a hard case, about 5 years ago was the last time West Jet allowed your 'sports equipment' as a freebie, now they charge. Be sure to secure it well. I am using locks this year and hopefully they don't need to break into it, they shouldn't as they X-ray scan it before it goes in oversize. West Jet count a rod carrier and tackle box as a 'set', so as long as both are under 50lbs and the rood tube is under 4.5' they just charge C$35 for an extra piece of baggage and you don't incur any 'oversize' fees. Check your baggage allowance, most airlines allow sports equipment, even giant surfboards!  I actually got pulled aside last year because my gear tested positive for Heroin and Gunpowder…..lol….the Heroin was easily explained when I showed them the prescription painkillers I was on, but the gunpowder took a bit to explain, finally they agreed that as I hunt it had probably come into contact with gunpowder that way…..PHEW!  Because they have started charging I figured I might as well max out and not try to get everything in my one free checked bag allowance, which I could do with what I'm taking, but whats the point, i will get charged $35 bucks for the rods, might as well pack a tackle box too.  I have a soft hip/chest sling I use as my tackle bag when I get there, and I pack toiletries in some smaller double side flip side lure boxes for when I get there so I am mobile, these go in my regular bagage and take no room at all. All the reels and tackle fit in my sturdy Canadian Tire MasterCraft toolbox($45). BE SURE YOU DONT TAKE ANY HOOKS IN CARRY-ON….YOU WILL LOSE THEM AT CUSTOMS! Also, as a Gopro fanatic be sure you take your batteries in CARRY ON, any other Lithium batteries you have need to be within the airlines limits, check their info and not a bad idea to have the battery manufacturers specs with you or they could confiscate those too. My carry on bag is a large rucksack which also doubles as tackle bag on my outings and West Jet allow you a free camera/computer bag too.  If I was only allowed one rod and reel and a few lures I would pack a medium Heavy action 6' to 7' rod, a 3000 or 4000 size reel (Shimano sizes) and one spool with 20lb braid and one with 50lb. Some 30 to 50lb Flourocarbon leader material (Seaguar Blue label is pretty awesome) and some Clacking raps, surface poppers and soft swimbaits and Jigs to launch them. I do have the opportunity while there to use float tube catamarans and maybe even get out in a boat as I've got a buddy there with that stuff, but mostly i'm casting from shore or wading the mangroves.   Anyhoo, here are some pictures of this year's arsenal, should be a blast!     MY SUPPLIES FOR 2 WEEKS        SOME OF THE SOFT PLASTICS        SOME OF THE HARDBAITS         JIGS AND VARIOUS OTHER TACKLE        RODS AND REELS (I have a couple spare spools for each reel)        EVERYTHING FITS WITH ROOM TO SPARE AND UNDER 50LBS!

991217,Shloim,2017-01-15 12:56:00,515,I've never fished there but have fished quite a bit in Jamaica. I can tell you from my experience that chrome last master chrome spinners are great and I've also caught a ton on the Berkley  ripple shads in a purple ish colour. Another little trick I learned to attract bait fish is milk bone dog treats. They dissolve slow and the little guts go nuts on the bits... also amazing while snorkeling and for the little ones... I bring 1 tray now because nothing worked as well as the quick fish chrome guys. They had cheap copies at Dollar am a.  I sent my buddy a bunch down in Jamaica. He uses them all the time
991239,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-15 17:06:00,8243,"Simon, you are packing ""some"" tackle? There is more there than some bait shops out here. I see all good choices for sure. Have you ever considered Circle Hooks for those teethie salties. I swear by them, just don't set the hook, much easier said than done. Also I as well am the worst tying braid to flouro or mono. I tried using Micro chain swivels about 5 years ago and they work great. This would be on my heavier rods only though. I was concerned about wear on the ferrules but with the great ceramic and super material ferrules today there is zero wear. Wear on the braid from coming in contact with the chain on the reel is not an issue either. I had the lines tested for break at Angler Outfitters by Joslyn and the line broke near the chain swivel but the knot at the swivels or the swivels did not.  Good luck and safe traveling there Simon, I'm jealous, again."
