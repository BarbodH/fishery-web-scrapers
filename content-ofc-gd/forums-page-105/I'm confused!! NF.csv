I have been sending P.M.s to a few and have made some headway on posting behavior. I am trying not to ban anyone or mod Qing anyone either. If you think it is about the click count it really isn't. There are months that we either just make bills or in some cases go negative because, we do not fill the site up with pop ups and ads all over the place. The click count became irrelevant a few years back when Google cut the payouts by 60% meaning if it wasn't for the small 3x3 sponsors we would not have to worry about anything except turning out the lights. I also think that we can still be a place for both the old and the new members to be friends with toleration from everyone.  Art"

'Garbage' was intended to be associated with the political posts and I have edited the post accordingly. Most sincer apologies, Simon Thank you Simon for clearing the air there.  True we have down time here and get bored and try to keep it active in any manner of chat hence the reason I kept ""joking"" with this topic.  To let all see my replies were all in humor to take away from the down side.  Who else asked it it was a bacon topic?  I get it, other sites don't have the banter and attempts at fun some of us try for her but this is NOT my site in any way but I enjoy it and decide based on thread name if I want to invest any time on it.  Just like facebook and you just scroll on past the meme's...  Same with here.  We still have a great core and it's sad some have moved on or are still here and not posting but some posters want legit info.  So why not ask?  We all come from a different walk of life and I get better info here (extension cord) than I ever could have via google.  Hence why they keep the site as it is.  Some don't like that but IT WORKS.  Thanks again Simon."
