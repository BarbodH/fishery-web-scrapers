991980,Rizzo,2017-01-19 23:51:00,4754,"I have done those drift boats for years (parents used to winter down in WPB and I was a single guy with time to burn). On those drift boats I have caught Black tips, sailfish, barracuda, dolphin, bonita,  kingfish and all those goofy bottom dwellers. Never got a wahoo tho, hoping this is the time."
