991872,wkrp,2017-01-19 13:58:00,656,Has anyone used this service and your thoughts. I placed an order on dec 28 and other than the order confirmation on the same day I haven't heard boo from them.
991891,CJGuelph,2017-01-19 16:34:00,16,"That's strange, I've used the service in the states previously and they where very good at updating you and I think it only took a couple of days to fulfill the order. I haven't used the Barrie store option though, and it's doubtful I will due to location."
991908,NANUK,2017-01-19 18:33:00,797, It has to be ordered through Cabelas.ca to be shipped free to a Canadian store. Cabelas.com is only for US stores
991909,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-19 18:40:00,10439,I've used it in the states and it has been great. I've also used it with Basspro when visiting the US.
991911,kickingfrog,2017-01-19 19:01:00,8333,I've used it many times. It's always been less than 14 days. You'd think if it was backordered they'd let you know.
991920,Terry,2017-01-19 20:08:00,14456,always same week when i have done it
992021,lookinforwalleye,2017-01-20 03:07:00,4399,used the service with no problems.....
992058,salmon,2017-01-20 13:00:00,334,I just got my order from cabelas.can in less than a week. Plus free shipping to my door.
992262,hutch4113,2017-01-21 13:27:00,374,"I have used it twice.  1st order I got updates, the 2nd one not so much.  I went into the store to check - turned out it was not there yet."
