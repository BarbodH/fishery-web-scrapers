991228,SirCranksalot,2017-01-15 15:17:00,3291," As far as honey holes. I have limited out when the boat parked not 12 feet from us was skunked on Klotz Lake. The same goes for trolling on The Bay of Quinte, our buddies boat trolling right next to us limited out when we never got a hit. Everything the same besides the 20 feet, same depth, same plug, line same everything except the guy holding the rods.  Some of the guys fishing the river here freely tell me, and presumably others, where the caught their bows and what bait or lure they were using. The chances of me repeating what they did are slim to none The fish are generally moving thru and it's quite likely that others standing close by, using a similar set-up, did not catch any. So, the moral to the story is:""depends on the situation""."
991229,manitoubass2,2017-01-15 15:18:00,11391," More like as a favour to friends, co workers and occasionally for my cousin who owns Camp Narrows on the north arm of Rainy Lake.  I considered doing it professionally at one point. Especially when we looked at buying a resort.  But thats not happening anytime soon  My dads guides more often than me but same situation. Lodge needs a temp fill in and its an awesome way to earn money on days off by basically getting a free vacation. Even though its pretty strenous work at least mentally."
991275,FloatnFly,2017-01-15 22:40:00,1640,"I won't post spots, but i won't shy away from posting a report, i've always said, if a person can recognize exactly where you are from a picture, they have fished there often enough to know it, good for them, the average person isn't going to recognize one pine tree from the next, or one corner of a creek from the next"
991278,aplumma,2017-01-15 23:40:00,6896,A lot of my river fishing spots are ones that a group of us have amassed over the years. We all trade spots and if one of us is on one we pass by and say hello and head to  another location. Most of the river spots are on underwater structure and holes or oyster bars so finding them twice is a pin point type of anchoring. A person can be 100 feet off the point and miss all of the fish. The small lakes and ponds are in danger with any person who can really read a depth finder can pattern the water easily and if CnR is not practiced it could remove a lot of the larger fish. I usually will fish with a friend and trade trips with them with the understanding that any spots that we go to in their boat are spots i will not visit unless they say it is o.k.. This has allowed me to fish with guides who will take me to their #1 spots for a good day of fishing without them feeling that they are risking their living. I have shown a few guides some new places and they have asked if they could use them. (not that they have to ask but it feels good when they do). No one owns a spot on the water but courtesy goes a long way in making friends on the water.   Art

Even for Southern On. you can say the Ottawa and then they have to pick a spot, good luck to them. I just say at the head of the fast water, go find some.

My dad was curious where it was since we fished manitou a fair amaount with laker success but nothing near that size.  Within 5 minutes I had gps coordinates to the spot and texted the photo to me dad. Needless to say he was shocked.  Then began the lesson of shutting off gps location while taking pics.  Never did fish the spot but my dad did, and bragged to the kid about the spot at work to the guy who sent him the pics.  He was totally dumbfounded... my dad taught him the lesson as well lol"

Gotta admit, I've done it myself.  It's easier surfing than actually trying lakes and spots doing trial and error."
991202,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-15 04:22:00,8243,"Bruce I don't think it is accusations by divulging locations on purpose or by accident, it more like what just happens. Out here on Erie I can give you way points and you will get skunked at the same location an hour from now and may never mark a fish there for the rest of the year. You might not be in the general location as to where they are tomorrow. Small feeder creeks and streams for sure, they can't take pressure like a big lake. The only thing I get from these 30 minute infomercials they call fishing shows today is what truck or tire to buy or what kind of Seagar line Charlie is using today. But they can screw up big time. A few years ago Izumi filmed a show on a smallish feeder creek going into Erie. They even said the name of the town and I won't. They hammered a species of fish, big fish, and showed their presentation. I said to Ted I bet that spot will be packed tomorrow because it was the same time of year and to on TV now it was filmed last year. Sure enough latter in the week we find our way into town and drive to the spot you can see from the road. No less than 6 boats  because that was what would fit. A dozen more where fishing close by. We went to the only slip in town and every truck had plate keepers and dealership tags from TO or farther. I emailed him about my displeasure and he emailed me back apologizing, he was wrong he admitted.  There have always been an infinity for some anglers to learn others ""honey holes"". You can go back to the old ""I will take you there but I need to blind fold you."" My brothers former father-in-law actually told me the only way he would take me is if he blind folded me. I laughed, he didn't. This was 30 years ago. It was a hot spot. A small creek in the back woods where you could see the Smallies sitting there in fast water stacked up like cord wood. They hit anything you threw at them. It was a feeder creek on a smaller size river running into a Great Lake. I had to promise him on my mother and fathers lives and make it believable before we left home. His son who came with us was none to happy about it. The walk to the creek was covert. I have been known to embellish but I swear this is how you got there. He knew the guy in the Pro Shop at the golf course we needed to cross. The only way to get there other than to walk the river a few tough miles through the Mekong Delta. You slung a bag over your shoulder with clubs and rod and reel in it. Put a few hooks jigs, 1 or 2 floating Rappalas and split shot in a knap sack along with a canteen of water and headed to # ? Tee. Hid the bag in the grass and walked a 1/2 mile in. Only enough fish were kept for supper at the camp grounds.  That's keeping a spot secret and I have only shown 1 other person in my life. I had to Marry her to keep the secret safe. That isn't true I had to send her to live in Guam.  As far as honey holes. I have limited out when the boat parked not 12 feet from us was skunked on Klotz Lake. The same goes for trolling on The Bay of Quinte, our buddies boat trolling right next to us limited out when we never got a hit. Everything the same besides the 20 feet, same depth, same plug, line same everything except the guy holding the rods."

At most you might have someone saying hmmm i was thinking of fishing either French river or Pointe Au Baril, ive seen AKRISONER catching fish in PAB I think we should try there this year.  You have to feel pretty special if you think a fishing report that says ""I fished Georgian Bay/The Kawarthas/ Lake Ontario/ or lake simcoe and now everyone wants to fish there because of you lol.  You wanna try fish Pointe Au Baril, go right ahead! I will tell you right now I am 1000000x more concerned of the fact that when im in my honey hole, boats driving by see me in my honey hole, than someone on here saying hey AKRISONER fishes in Pointe Au Baril and catches fish!"

You haven't been here long enough to have experienced what these types of boards can do to locations and people. Check back in, in a few years and let us know what you have found out. HH"
990962,SirCranksalot,2017-01-13 14:17:00,3291,"I think we overestimate the influence these type of fishing boards have. e.g. I live next to the Notty. The number of people fishing nearby varies a lot, depending on the river conditions and how well the fish are biting. It doesn't at all depend on anything posted on the boards---I have never seen anything specific. Everyone knows about this spot----fishermen come from TO, Hamilton, all over. They've been coming for years(more like decades) long before the existence of fishing boards.  Just remember how prevalent texting is and how quickly word spreads----he told 2 friends, the told 2 friends etc, etc, etc. The very definition of exponential increase."

HH  ive been here 3 years and consistently posting reports...no change what so ever so far except that I have learned a lot, Ive met a few cool people and have gone fishing with them and learned a lot from them.  Thats about it.  If you want to try fishing in my area go right ahead, i spent 10 years fishing my area and without the right techniques, patterns etc I didnt do well for a very long time.  I have had people reach out to me directly including a couple of guys asking me specifically for GPS co-ordinates to my best spots and I simply brushed them off. Thats about the extent of it.  I hope if you fish PAB you get your bait from Dennis in PAB, anything I can do to keep his business alive."
990967,BillM,2017-01-13 14:28:00,17367,"When it comes to seasonal stuff like steelheading, reports can absolutely make a huge difference.  I've seen it more then once.   Also, you ever wonder why there seems to be a floatilla of pontoon boats floating down the Notty on any fishable weekend?  You think it was like that 5-6 years ago?   I'm guilty of it myself unfortunately, it sucks because I can't take any of those reports/pics back."
990968,Beans,2017-01-13 14:39:00,3339, My folks had a new home built at Leslie & Lawrence in Don Mills in 1954 and the day Hazel hit was the day we moved in. Long time ago and I was only 7 but I remember it like it was yesterday and can still see our stuff blowing down the street. West end of Toronto got hit far harder then we did in the east end though and if I recall correctly 88 people died in the Humber River area.  Lousy day for Toronto.  I remember having to walk in the pouring rain from College and Yonge Streets to Coxwell and Gerrard Streets as the streetcars were not working...The streets were like having to wade a shallow creek at every intersection...The babysitter gave me crap for being late...LOL

I agree with most of what you're saying...especially the political and electronics line! Too funny. But, Pointe Au Baril is a very large area with countless individual structure targets. A very different scenario than what has been experienced in southern Ontario. Bill's example of the Notty is bang on. A complete stranger can break it down in a day by people watching alone. You know that you could fish PAB every weekend for a decade and not fish the same spot twice if you chose to.  In addition, and most importantly, it's not 40 minutes from Toronto. You could increase the number of fisherman up there on any given weekend by 50 guys and never notice(other than the ramp)...try that same number on most rivers or a lakes. You're young, I predict that one day years from now you'll be posting about how you'd fish all day and not see another boat. Don't expedite that, just enjoy it now."

I fish buckhorn fairly often and I see what a difference that extra hour and a half drive makes.  Lol you got me there as well in reference to never seeing another boat...unless you are targetting eyes in the fall, i can fish all day for smallies in November and never see a soul."
990988,lew,2017-01-13 15:56:00,12766,"I had a house trailer on a small Kawartha lake for 36 years and the musky fishing was excellent yet very few people ever fished for them there except me. I knew every rock, stump and blade of grass that held fish but most days I had them all to myself  Alot of years I'd average around 100 fish annually and usually get at least 1 a week over 45"" with plenty over 50"" and one morning I boated 9 fish in 2 1/2 hours.  I used to post a ton of fishing reports on this board over the years but never once did I ever name the lake. Plenty of guys from this board fished with me and I always asked not to name it either.  Don't know if that helped keep the place unknown or not but I imagine it must have helped. I'd think if everyone knew how great the fishing was there it would have been much more pressured.  Haven't been back there for 7 years now but I still never see the name posted on this or any other board and I think that's a good thing but who really knows."

That's crazy Norm as that's exactly where we moved from that day.  We left Robbins Ave which was the 1st street south of Gerrard running east off Coxwell.

I hope if you fish PAB you get your bait from Dennis in PAB, anything I can do to keep his business alive.  I agree with this on large lakes, sure. Lake O, Georgian Bay, Simcoe, Lake Joseph, Rosseau, its easy to name drop those places. Unless your photos have a landmark in the back or you post your GPS points, its very difficult for people to find where you are fishing.  The reports that always concerned me were the ones that said ""(insert lake name) fishing report' for the smaller or back lakes. People can google search and find info or they look at the forum and see the name of a lake. It automatically receives more pressure just because people know the lake exists."
991015,GBW,2017-01-13 17:50:00,8460,"  you are right, the 3 hour drive crazily acts as some kind of force field that keeps the majority of goons at bay.  I fish buckhorn fairly often and I see what a difference that extra hour and a half drive makes. See, that right there is why some of us don't post reports anymore.  The lake I fish the most isn't a big lake so it's easy to say ""oh I know that cottage and where it is"".  In fact, I made a new fishing buddy for that very reason via a facebook fishing group post.  I was not the poster of the report or pic but I sent him a msg, ""see that boat and the Canada flag in the background of your pic over your wife shoulder, say hi that's my place"""

991024,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-13 18:35:00,8243,"So depending on your outlook it can be harmless posting details or it can do great harm. I never thought about the PM scenario. We, well I at least would answer PM's for my Bass spots here on Erie, they can be hot, very hot and  it is a massive body of water until one considers how small it can get along the shoreline. And I always presumed most don't eat Bass. Wrong. I'll not be answering PM's with specifics any longer. Want to catch and keep massive Carp, PM me, you can park in my driveway."
991027,chris.brock,2017-01-13 18:40:00,4053," A guy at work I hardly knew, came up to me earlier this week actually and said he knows me from OFC. I asked what's his name or handle on the board. He said he just lurks and has been doing so for years. He's probably reading this  On another board a guy gave a glowing ice fishing report on a spot near my cottage. I drove by the next Saturday and there was people and pop up huts everywhere.  I carelessly posted a picture and some guys I know recognized the lake. It was a great little lake. It didn't take long for them to keep everything and fish it out, now it sucks.  The moral of the story, reports are great but best be careful."

991035,grimsbylander,2017-01-13 19:25:00,3016,"If you're on here to get spots, you're NOT going to be a registered member. It's one thing to anonymously show up beside you on your spot and play dumb and another to pull up the weekend after your great fishing report and look like a tool if/when recognized. If I wanted to fish a spot I saw here, pm'ing the OP would be the first thing I'd do.  Don't underestimate the far reaching grasp of the info on here. I've googled lakes before and I think every damn time I get a link back to a conversation on OFC!"
