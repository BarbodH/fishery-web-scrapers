I never said you were dying, I said I had a family member die on the lake your talking about going on 2 days after it froze.  He went through when most of the lake had 10 inches of ice.  You think he knowingly went out on a snowmobile thinking it was not safe?  Stuff happens man and you need to be ready for it.  Always be prepared to go through.

If you look at sturgeon on the map, the lake looks like a big opening in the river, flowing down from fenelon into pigeon.

988295,huzzsaba,2016-12-10 15:08:00,884,how long does it take if it stays below zero to get 5-6 inches of ice?
988296,crappieperchhunter,2016-12-10 15:14:00,2582,how long does it take if it stays below zero to get 5-6 inches of ice?  March  IMHO it depends more on  wind before the lake skins over.  If it's real windy it can get pretty cold and the lakes won't skin over because of the waves on the water. However in perfect windless snowless conditions mother nature can give you 5-6 inches of ice pretty quick. One year I went up to Cooch for my first ice trip on a Sunday and it wasn't safe enough for me. I went again on the Friday...5 days later and there was 7 plus inches of ice and a few sleds where out.  Like Sinker I expect to be chipping and stepping somewhere next weekend.
