991754,manitoubass2,2017-01-18 20:43:00,11391,"I would agree. At least to some extent its possible and plausable.  I for one was shocked when cormorants decimated many species on Rainy Lake in such a short time frame.  Its a large body of water too and the damage was done very quickly.  Quite shocking really.  But that being said lakes all have their own ecosystem and manage differently.  Pretty tricky to scientifically analyze with so many factors in play.  Thats why I like the ""play it safe"" type methods, because we never really have a full understanding, so treading lightly is often the best solution.  Not to say it will happen, but a new disease or something similar could be introduced and change things quickly, or slowly over time.  No waterbody has infinite biological sustainability on the levels we expect or are used too."
991757,crappieperchhunter,2017-01-18 20:50:00,2582,Any water body can be effected by over harvest.  Perch fishing on Simcoe which is still really good....isn't what it was 30 years ago when I first started fishing it. I think it would be in far worse shape if the limits had not been put into effect.
991767,OhioFisherman,2017-01-18 21:40:00,6623,"The only times I have encountered "" Stunting "" is on small bodies of water that have a population far in excess of the available food supply, couple of farm ponds just loaded with silver dollar sized bluegills as a kid come to mind and a few beaver ponds similarly loaded with 4"" brookies that attack anything that hits the water like pirranhas. Thinning the herd in both cases would increase the quality of the fish.  My area is loaded with farm ponds, I have seen some loaded with silver dollar sized crappie and bluegill, on those ponds the crappie and bluegill seem to take the place of minnows as the source of food for bass. I like to see a pond with some 8-12 inch golden shiners in it, a breeding stock of baitfish that get too big for some of the other fish to eat."

I would like to see if the changes were made on mnr quota.. never the less I feel keeping some walleyes wont affect the population.  The link I posted shows the actual harvest & Total Allowable Catch for the entire lake (which is set out by the International Lake Erie Comittee not the MNR) which is the numbers I quoted.  It also says:    The OMNR&F can only decide hour the Ontario portion of the TAC is split up between commercial and sport.  The TAC for each of the four international management zones changes a bit every year but it's not much different now than for the 2014 report I posted.  I agree though, the sportfishing limits in Lake Erie don't seem unreasonable but I don't think the same can be said for other lakes.  Point is that the sportfishing harvest is far more than lots of people think it is relative to the commercial harvest"

991174,Acountdeleted,2017-01-14 23:44:00,2562,"They do creel surveys. First year I met Chad and Joey on nippising we got stopped. Took size, number and scales to age the fish. After that it's all formulaic to estimate within a 95% certainty.  It's true what you said about Erie. When I was down there the MNRF used to have a field day. I think it's 4 votes on all that goes on with Erie. Ontario gets one, Michigan gets one, Ohio gets one, New York gets one. If the states wants something and Canada doesn't, we're screwed."

I cannot think of any reliable and or pheasable way to do such a thing   They calculate the estimated catch using data from anglers who do their 'Angling Diaries' each season to determine how many fish are caught for each 'angler effort hour'.  The combine this data with info from the boat launches and other surveys which gives them approximate  'angling effort hours' and do the math.   They've done it this way for a long time and they seem to think it gives them a pretty good guestimate at least.   Certainly not perfect but no statistical method such as this really is.
991176,Sterling,2017-01-14 23:50:00,477,"For some lakes, panfish are in direct competition with the most targeted species (walleye) and so the MNR want angling pressure on perch.  Even with such liberal limits for perch, 90%+ of angling effort goes to other species, so as far as larger lakes are concerned, perch are in no danger. In fact they're thriving.  The downside of course, is that smaller lakes suffer."

Easiest thing would be a reduction in limits, however there would likely be a lot of pressure from some of the angling community to either limit a reduction or even keep things as they are. If you personally want to attempt to make a difference (obviously one can't control what others do especially if they are within their legal right) the easiest thing would be releasing the larger panfish (such as maybe not keeping gills above 8-9"" if in the Kawarthas) and not harvesting larger males when they are nesting. If you want to keep your limit of the big guys though and aren't doing anything illegal, all the power to ya haha."

Bernie is now sweating thinking holy crap, i bet that perch is hooked right through the lips in that pike's belly.  The first question outta the MNR is, ""hey you kept that pike, do you mind if we take some samples?"" Bernie says sure!...they then take the pike and cut its belly open! Bernie is a big old cape bretoner but my brother said he never saw bernie sweat so much in his entire life hahahaa. In the end the MNR took their samples and everyone went on their merry way.

Most of the time the walleye was in the pikes jaw when we brought it up. Pike would go green and spit the walleye out.  Before I knew it was illegal we used to get pike off the dock of the french all the time. Hook a 4 inch perch through the dorsal and hang it on 3 feet under a bobber.

But let's try and be civil, discuss the point, not target anyone or any group and try to stick to the facts. I honestly would like to have a true debate about this. (Art, please keep your finger on the lock button. I'll also delete the thread if it gets out of hand)  Deep breath:  How does everyone feel about the large limits on Pan fish and people keeping their limit?  I'll be honest, I love taking half a dozen to 12 perch, bluegills, crappie for a couple of meals. I prefer the taste and (hopefully) sustainability more so then Walleye, pike or other sport fish.  But then I see photos on Instagram or on Facebook of people with the posts '4 of us kept our limit of bluegills. Now to fillet them' where there is someone on the ice with a pile of 200 fish. This is well within their right and they aren't breaking any laws, but it gives me a bit of an uneasy feeling.  Now, that being said, I've talked with people as well that I trust and really like who will say they will go out once, keep their panfish limit and then not keep another fish the entire season. That seems reasonable to me. But for others what would stop them from keeping 200 fish a day? I know the legislation has a possession limit but, if the fish are at home in the deep freeze, how will anyone know?  Again, let's keep it civil please but I'm really curious to see what everyone here thinks."
990974,mike rousseau,2017-01-13 15:03:00,4661,Instead of cleaning 10 perch every time I wanna eat fish I'll clean 50 and freeze em  Then catch and release till I need more

IMO the limit could definitely be lower, 50 is kind of insane, is 20 not reasonable? but im praying that the ones that set the limit know what the hell they are doing.  What makes a lot of sense to me is the limits in zone 14 for walleye, where a person can take enough fish for a meal today and a meal for the freezer. I.e. 1 fish for your plate that day and one fish for another day.  So if its pans, maybe its 20 fish, 10 fish nuggets today and 10 for the freezer? but I am not an expert so I leave the decisions to them. A lot of things in the regulations dont make sense to me at all (the slot limit in zone 14 is completely backwards to conventional wisdom and I have no clue why)"
990983,grimsbylander,2017-01-13 15:33:00,3016,"This is easy. Daily and possession limits are established and enforced by law. If someone is keeping fish and is acting within the laws, it is their personal choice and none of my business. Just like I can choose to release fish without having to answer to anyone. If either one of us were to step outside the rules, then either of us is well within our rights to see it get corrected. If I have an issue with daily or possession limits, I should take it up with the correct level of government or organization (eg. OFAH) NOT the fisherman. I don't have any more right to whine at a fisherman with 50 perch(and I wouldn't, good for them!) than I do a person driving 100kph on the QEW. They're well with their rights."

I legitimately don't know the answer to this and although we can speculate I don't think we will really know until the limits change or its two late. I just wish I had a way of knowing, hence why I opened this up to the forum rather then being set in my ways.  The second one is that, is setting a possession limit something that is feasible/ enforceable? I could see being able to enforce it at hunt/fish camps and or overnight huts on popular ice fishing locations, but with a limit of 50 pan fish, what would stop someone from going out, catching 50 perch on Simcoe today, driving back to Toronto tonight, add, rinse, repeat for 7 days? Are the limits set with that possibility in mind? (obviously none of us can answer that. I'm just curious about opinion).  I would never ever go up to a fisherman in person, on forums or anywhere else and tell them they are wrong or I don't agree with what the are doing when they are well within the laws. This was just simply for debate. (I'm actually hoping someone provides facts stats or evidence that says that anglers keeping 50 panfish a day is sustainable. Would put my mind at ease)."
990986,Terry,2017-01-13 15:51:00,14456,I have no problem with people keeping their limit. I am however glad that they did put a limit on pan fish  Many people only get to fish one or 2 times a year. So 50 perch limit is not a lot for a yearly take of perch. Now the morons that post a limit of fish 5 days in a row. You might well believe they have a freezer full and are breaking the law

The only thing that would stop someone from doing that is their conscience.   There is a daily catch limit of 50 perch for Simcoe with a possession limit of 100. Therefore, there are currently regulations in place to prevent this from happening. But, just like many other fish and game regulations we need people to be honest and abide by the rules as some are practically impossible to enforce.

Numbers were declining a bit and there was a panfish focus group put together to discuss possible limits at that time.  The group consisted of cottage resort owners, an Asian group from the city and a number of other individuals.  This group met for some time (sometimes heated) then were told that there would be no limits initiated because there was no biological reason to do so. We all know that changed a few years back with the new regs putting limits on most panfish. My biggest concern for the lake I live on is that people don't know the regs or don't give a darn.  Yes, the bluegill limit is 300, but anglers are only permitted to keep 30 at 7"" or over.  I'm just not sure most adhere to this.  I see the same boats in the same spots for days on end which scares me.  Taking too many of the larger breeders is not good and I believe this is what was happening on Rice Lake way back when."

Yes, panfish breed like cockroaches, but large panfish that most anglers like to catch are definitely not a renewable resource.  Of course, the first boom of crappies in a new lake will dominate a lake. Many of the Ontario lakes will go into cycles in the future.

In that era it was hard enough for an adult to find a job, let alone a kid of school age?  He grew up a couple of miles away from Lake Erie and catching fish was a large part of him helping to provide food for the family, that seemed to stick with him all his life. I have 3 brothers, the year of our 5 birthday it was the ritual for us to go spring crappie fishing with dad, or first over nighter fishing with dad. None of us ever made it two days, we ran out of room to store fish. 5 - 5 gallon buckets, buckets and coolers full of crappie on ice.  For a 3-4 week span in the spring dad and anyone and everyone he had taken fishing to his spots seem to be there at least one day on the weekends. Ohio had no limits at the time, but the size of a "" keeper "" seemed to get smaller as the years went by.  We didn't have limits or regulation on walleye fishing either, I had to go to Ontario to catch my first walleye because they were few and far between here in the late 50's and 60's.

You all forget there is a kill factor to catch and release, an optimist may put it around 10% and a pessimist maybe 20%, anyone that fishes hard on a long weekend and catches and released several times his limit each day has probably killed more fish than the dude who put the first 5 keepers on his stringer.  edit: sorry I am primarily a salmon / trout guy so I said 5, guess bass and pickerel are 6 but you get my drift."

I have buddies that are 100% c and r for brookies but handle them like ragdolls, no doubt killing a great deal of them, and then give guys a hard time for keeping a few fish.  Idiots.  More on topic, the only thing I really have to contribute regarding panfish is that people should be considering releasing the big fish and focusing on keeping a limit of the smallest size of fish worth cleaning, this should help with the stunted population thing."

I'm not sure where the 99.06% number comes from, I know in Lake Erie the sportsfishing typically accounts for around 20% of the annual harvest of perch and about 50% of the walleye.  I don't have last year's numbers handy but this summarizes the 2015 numbers which are pretty typical.  The combined harvest numbers are normally around 75% of the TAC (total allowable catch) set out each year by the Lake Erie Commission.  I'm sure the few other lakes that still have commercial netting would have similar number splits.  http://derby.hcslions.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/FactSheet-2015.pdf"
