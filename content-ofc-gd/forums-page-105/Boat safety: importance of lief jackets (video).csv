991896,Cast-Away,2017-01-19 16:52:00,790,A food video for sure.  It looks like the driver lost control when crossing the wake from another boat.
991898,grimsbylander,2017-01-19 16:55:00,3016,A food video for sure.  It looks like the driver lost control when crossing the wake from another boat. Mechanical failure in the steering. It was either a blown hose or the cylinder popped loose.
991905,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-19 18:10:00,8243,"You don't get on my boat without a PFD. I bought an extra inflatable for 100 bucks and my 1st mate wears it or stays home. Simple as that. I don't know how many times I have challenged guys to swim 100 yards for 100 bucks after they say ""I can swim"". Yea right, from 1 end of the pool to the other, once.  Those guys were lucky that boat didn't swerve back to the left, they were right beside the Port side. They would have been hamburger. I wonder if the driver had the lanyard on? I am forgetful hooking mine up at top speed.  I looked back at the video, it sounds like the engine shut down. Hook up your lanyard, a good habit. A bit of a pain when fishing but a good habit to have."
991925,G.mech,2017-01-19 20:23:00,830,"I went out to sea trial a used boat once and it did a similar thing to that when we hit about 45mph.  It didn't toss us over the side but almost did.  Worse yet the throttle was still down and the lanyard wasn't attached.   It was a bit of a hairy side to side, head slamming ride until we got it shut down.  Found out that the boat had been sitting for a long period with a small hydraulic leak which led to free play in the steering.  I always check for slop in the steering before I launch now....lanyards and life jackets became more popular after that too."
