992017,Dara,2017-01-20 02:45:00,3052,I believe the politicians try to have our best interest at heart. For me they just don't explain enough. I think they hide a lot of the plan because they think people can't grasp the big picture and a lot can't. Take the green energy plan. Lots of it is crap to us but now I hear China and a few other countries are looking toward solar power. From what I hear it is now one of the cheapest forms of new power. Due to our commitment to development and research. We can be building this and importing knowledge to other countries. That's real jobs not just assembly line stuff.  Then you get to the guaranteed minimum income for those that don't have big tech jobs. We all have to live and factories are a thing of the past. Machines do it all now...big picture
992018,Dutch01,2017-01-20 02:49:00,1431,"I hadn't noticed that but to be honest I wasn't looking for it either. Keeping the political stuff in the NF threads sounds like a reasonable compromise at any rate, at least until (and if) the refs change the rules...."

992122,Oggie,2017-01-20 16:15:00,588,You're right about the Fraser Institute that's one of the reasons I didn't like the idea of standardized school testing in Ontario. It was there idea when Harris was in power.  Thanks dude. I'm not sure that's the consensus opinion but I'm not trying to win friends here. Just me being me.I will say I stayed up way too late last night researching the Fraser Institute but I'm glad I did. I'll know to be wary the next time I see them quoted in an article.

Imagine being uber rich, business contacts worldwide in all major sectors, then you gain power of a country.  The gains that could be made afterwards financially could be huge and of unreal benefit to a business man.  Just like Trump donating his presidential earnings. It looks good publicly but he knows he has much more to gain financially afterwards than a measily 450 thousand dollars.  Im not sure at what point in history this began happening? But business and government is just an open door of power and business recycling itself"

If O'Leary wins the nomination he will be the next Prime Minister of Canada. There are a uh, a uh few uh members here that uh can uh  beat uh Jr. That uh is getting embarrassing.  More name dropping, I got to know him a bit over a few cold ones after the shows in the 80's when I worked security for the Don Cherry Show filmed at his restaurant on Walnut and Main in downtown Hamilton. He ran the film crew and had a head full of hair. It took me a long time to realize it was him until I read his book. He was much nicer than Don Cherry, The Grapes we see on TV is a character he made up for TV. If you weren't one of his guests or one of the young models standing there he wouldn't give you the time of day. The brunette is my ex."

I don't even think he will be fun to watch.  Hopefully Canadians don't follow the American lead. Its good we have a few months to see how this Trump character rolls before a decision has to be made"

You don't usually read such honest statements from one co worker about another in such a public forum, Wowza again.  I still think he will win though. He probably would be the best Minister of Finance this country has ever seen but no way he is a guy that is going to answer to anyone. It killed him answering to the executives at Mattel when he had to stay on for a year or so in order for his software sale of a billon dollars to close. It drove him nuts.  His book is an easy read. I recommend it strongly.  ""KEVIN O'LEARY, THE COLD HARD TRUTH on Business, money & life.""  Published by Doubleday books Canada. Hey I just noticed mines autographed, it might be worth something someday. It was a gift from my Sis in Law. There's even a  pic of her and he. His hand is behind her in a very strategic position. Usually I pass hard cover books on but it was a gift so I didn't. I need to re read it."

991929,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-19 20:51:00,8243,"That is good to hear Rick. He sure didn't act like that around the hired help.  His mother was still alive then and living not 10 minutes from the bar. He barked at one of the production crew once telling them to take his Mom a meal from the kitchen to her at home. The guy said he was busy setting up and would do it as soon as he was done. He was fired on the spot in front of everyone. He came back a few shows latter though. I am really glad to hear he was good with you kids, that's the most important thing, how he treated the kids. That would have been around 15 or so years latter, I hope he had changed and maybe he did. I have to say good for him."

My gramps and great uncle played pro hockey in europe waaay back, maybe 52 ish. My other cousin did as well and actually made the back up roster for the red wings.  After that he either started, or bought northland hockey sticks, I cant recall??  Anyways I was in TO with my gramps and he had a surprise for me. And thats what it was. Dinner with don. He was amazing to us, and boy did they chug the beers.  He donated one of his damn ugly suits to our town years later lol.  Maybe the fame got the best of him?

You also have to decide how much money gets spent on social services, health care, welfare, in the best interest of the country and people involved. He doesn't strike me as the type that would spend a whole bunch on welfare.  As with Trump, if his promise holds true, 20 million people will be without health care at the end of the week.

I think O'Leary will take Canada by storm because he's straightforward and not always politically correct.  He's kind of a well educated, intelligent Trump.  People are worried about Canada's financial situation and O':Leary sounds like he knows how to begin to fix the problem. er um which ah well spoken um Liberal are you ah speaking of ???  edit : video added, yeah I know it's a cheap shot but this guy is painful to listen to  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwMgYoiI83U"
991714,manitoubass2,2017-01-18 18:58:00,11391,Id back this  Wynne gone is reason enough  Alberta would back him hardcore I know that much!
991716,SirCranksalot,2017-01-18 19:02:00,3291,Another blowhard in politics!! Just what we all needed!!
991717,manitoubass2,2017-01-18 19:10:00,11391,"Im all for anyone that holds government and elected members accountable, just like all of us are.  Things can turn around real quick with your boss calling you out to your face"
991720,leaf4,2017-01-18 19:13:00,2466,I wish it was for Ontario provincially lol. Although I think Patrick brown has a good chance at getting a majority over Orville next election anyhow
991731,Headhunter,2017-01-18 19:45:00,5703,"Another blowhard in politics!! Just what we all needed!! Actually what we need and they have found in the States is someone is who the dog and not the tail. For far too long, we have had the tail wagging the dog and that is what has created Trump and will likely help O'Leary as well. HH"
991734,Acountdeleted,2017-01-18 19:47:00,2562,I wish it was for Ontario provincially lol. Although I think Patrick brown has a good chance at getting a majority over Orville next election anyhow   Wynn has really screwed it up. I know of so many die hard Liberals that are saying they will vote conservative for the first time ever next Provincial election. I think we are all starting to agree that the ban hammer needs to be dropped on spending.
991735,manitoubass2,2017-01-18 19:54:00,11391,Spending and taxation
991736,Dutch01,2017-01-18 19:57:00,1431,"He's actually not a very good business man at all, he just plays one on tv.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/kevin-oleary-hes-not-a-billionaire-he-just-plays-one-on-tv/article4564334/"
991740,Dutch01,2017-01-18 20:00:00,1431,"Somehow these goons manage to convince the people they fleece that they are their only savour. It's mind boggling. Trump made a career out of not paying working class people for work performed, and somehow they think he cares about ""the little guy""'."
991741,Dutch01,2017-01-18 20:04:00,1431,"Also, it's almost impossible to win an election without Quebec's seats. Quebec will never vote for someone who doesn't speak French.  I know, he's taking lessons. We'll see if QC buys it or not."
991742,manitoubass2,2017-01-18 20:06:00,11391," I genuinely believe, like Trump, these individuals gain traction by default.  Its like getting in trouble at work and some guy shows up and chews out your boss over it.  People get behind that fairly quickly.  Whether its genuine or not is def. Debatable.  Drastic measures seem to unite people en masse quickly when the country and average worker etc are not thriving.  Not saying its good or bad. Just been my personal observation"
991743,Big Cliff,2017-01-18 20:08:00,6899,"He's actually not a very good business man at all, he just plays one on tv.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/kevin-oleary-hes-not-a-billionaire-he-just-plays-one-on-tv/article4564334/ With a net worth of over $400,000,000.00 US and he started with a $10,000.00 investment from his mother? I'd say he's done something right!"
991747,Dutch01,2017-01-18 20:21:00,1431,"I would say it means he's screwed over a lot of people and been sued on a regular.  If getting rich by ripping people off is a guy you want running the country, I can't agree with you there Cliff.  Read the article, see what Mattel had to say about him after losing billions dealing with him."
991748,Dutch01,2017-01-18 20:27:00,1431,"I'm sure I'm rufling feathers here, but to be clear I am not advocating for liberal partisanship, I am arguing against all partisanship.  ""Joining a tribe"", liberal or conservative, rarely leads people to more reasonable and rational thought on issues."
991750,Dutch01,2017-01-18 20:34:00,1431,"A little less off topic, everyone at the debate seemed to focus on attacking Maxine Bernier. That tells me they saw him as the biggest threat on the stage. I'm sure they'll be attacking O'leary at the next one."
991751,manitoubass2,2017-01-18 20:35:00,11391,"Carry on Dutch.  Personally, I learn alot from your posts and point of view(whether I agree or disagree)  You have a knack for rational debate on various topics and always back it up appropriately and I for one, appreciate the insight and effort put into your posts."
991752,Dutch01,2017-01-18 20:41:00,1431, I will say I stayed up way too late last night researching the Fraser Institute but I'm glad I did. I'll know to be wary the next time I see them quoted in an article. Just the association with the Koch brothers alone is enough to put me off.
991755,manitoubass2,2017-01-18 20:46:00,11391,"Im in the same boat lol.  And yes, when the Koch brothers are involved, whether warrented or not, raises red flags with me as well."
