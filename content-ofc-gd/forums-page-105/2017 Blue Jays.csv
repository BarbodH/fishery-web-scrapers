Jays management wouldn't be playing these games if they had 100% commitment having EE return. Rogers/Shapiro/Atkins were the new guys to the club and if they had any sense, would have fully realized the value that EE brings to the team. But no...they want to use their ""metrics"" to establish the quality of a player. Pearce and Morales do not equate to EE.  Again, if Jays management were completely serious keeping EE around, why wasn't the $80 mil 4 year deal pitched before the start of 2016, instead of waiting till the last minute? At that moment, it wouldn't have mattered what Jays management would have offered, the intent from them was never there to begin with.  Rogers/Shapiro/Atkins were given a championship calibre team and looking at the team now, they've regressed instead of progressed.  Playing games is what Jays management having been doing. EE stated way back before 2016 that he wanted to sign with the Jays, wanted to end his career as a Jays...What the Jays management did was exactly that...play games.  I'll give credit where credit is due...Happ and Estrada turned out to be great and without a doubt, the starting pitching was more than terrific."

At this time, Jays, Astros, Yankees, Rangers, and Red Sox all had some level of interest in signing Edwin.  But, Edwins agent, wanted to play his games, and test the market, and one by one, the teams that were strongly interested, had moved on to their plan B.  Franktherabbit, you see, the Jays management did what they could to bring him back, they wanted their player, not the games his agent wanted to play  http://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/timeline-negotiations-blue-jays-encarnacion/   TORONTO – Debate continues to rage over Edwin Encarnacion’s messy departure from the Toronto Blue Jays, with emotional fans split between blaming the team for not getting a deal done, and the iconic slugger for aiming too high off the bat. Setting off the visceral reaction is the agreement Encarnacion reached with Cleveland late Thursday night on a three-year deal that guarantees $60 million, a total that can swell up to $80 million if a fourth-year option is exercised. The contract guarantees less than the $80-million, four-year offer tabled by the Blue Jays in early November, a disparity fuelling much of the angst. That Blue Jays offer also included the possibility of a fifth year option that if exercised would have pushed the contract’s value up to $100 million, two sources told Sportsnet on Friday. Hence, the primary question many Blue Jays fans keep asking is why things played out this way when there was so much common ground. Based on conversations with a number of industry sources, here’s a rough reconstruction of the fruitless negotiations between the sides. Spring training – Working under an opening day deadline imposed by Encarnacion, who didn’t want to be distracted by talks in-season, the Blue Jays tabled the idea of a two-year contract extension that included two additional option years and a reworking of the slugger’s 2016 salary of $10 million. Scenarios that included vesting options or buyout options that increased the guarantee are raised but there’s no traction. Talks end, the season begins, and negotiations are shelved until the season’s end. Nov. 3 – The Blue Jays make their first offer to Encarnacion, $70 million over four years, and it doesn’t move the needle. There is no formal counter-offer but Encarnacion’s camp floats the number of $125 million over five years. The sense is that Encarnacion is seeking a guarantee of $100 million or so. Nov. 6 – Seeking to bring negotiations to a quick resolution, the Blue Jays break from typical negotiating practices and counter against themselves, upping their offer to $80 million over four years. A performance-based vesting option for a fifth year at $20 million, or a straight team option for $20 million with a buyout factored into the $80 million guarantee is raised. There’s no counter-offer from the Encarnacion camp, which wasn’t prepared to make a deal with free agency so near. There’s also uncertainty about where the collective bargaining agreement talks were going, and what that meant for his market. The Blue Jays, however, make clear they want some clarity on whether their offer is going to be good enough to get a deal done. If it’s not, there was no sense for either side to waste their time. Nov. 7 – The Blue Jays arrive at the general managers meetings in Scottsdale, Ariz., and extend qualifying offers to Encarnacion and Jose Bautista ahead of a 5 p.m. ET deadline. During a meeting with Encarnacion’s camp, the Blue Jays are asked if they will disengage if their offer is rejected. The reply is they won’t, but that they would aggressively pursue alternatives that could close off an Encarnacion return. Such a deal isn’t imminent, but could come quickly, the Blue Jays warn. Encarnacion, feeling rushed just as he arrived at free agency, asks for time to sleep on the offer and the Blue Jays agree, but reiterate that they need some clarity on where things stand with the market about to open. Edwin Encarnacion, left, and Jose Bautista. (Fred Thornhill/CP) Nov. 8 – Free agency opens at 12:01 a.m. ET, and both sides begin speaking with others. The impression the Blue Jays have is that the Encarnacion camp is set on getting $100 million. There’s communication between the team and the player, underlining that the Blue Jays could move on if he doesn’t accept. They want a signal that they’re in the ballpark. Speaking to reporters at the GM meetings, Ross Atkins says cryptically that, ""Offers often times come on and off tables."" By day’s end there’s no movement and it’s here that both sides appear to make critical miscalculations. The Encarnacion camp, despite being told dialogue with other players was set to start, doesn’t feel a divorce is imminent. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, conclude from the lack of urgency on the other side of the table that there’s at least one other team willing to be in the $80-$100 million range. Both were wrong. Nov. 9 – While Blue Jays president and CEO Mark Shapiro is working on the signing of Cuban prospect Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Atkins opens talks with Adam Katz, the agent for Kendrys Morales. There is near instant traction between the sides. The Blue Jays believe the New York Yankees, Houston Astros and Cleveland Indians are also pursuing Morales. With things at a standstill with Encarnacion, they want to lock down a middle-of-the-order bat so they aren’t left exposed and can be more patient in filling their other holes. Nov. 10 – The Encarnacion camp and Blue Jays touch base as the GM meetings conclude but there are no substantive talks. Progress, meanwhile, continues in the negotiations with Morales. Nov. 11 – The Blue Jays reach agreement on a $33-million, three-year deal with Morales. They didn’t circle back to Encarnacion before striking the deal, but still saw a scenario where he could return and share first base and DH duties with Morales. The deal caught the Encarnacion camp off-guard, with agent Paul Kinzer saying this week they didn’t anticipate the Blue Jays acting so quickly. They also didn’t understand the rush to sign Morales, especially if Encarnacion was the preferred option. Nov. 12 – The sides speak again with the Blue Jays saying the door to an Encarnacion return isn’t closed, that Justin Smoak could potentially be traded, but the $80 million offer was off the table, and creativity would be needed. The notion is raised that $90 million over four years would have gotten a deal done. The sides agree to stay in touch. Nov. 13-21 – The free-agent market is slow to develop, with Red Sox president David Dombrowski making the point that uncertainty over where the luxury tax is headed in collective bargaining agreement talks makes a big free-agent splurge unlikely. Other teams are reluctant to dive in to the free-agent market as well, eroding what observers expected to be a more robust market for Encarnacion. The Astros, Yankees and Red Sox all aggressively pursue Carlos Beltran. The Rangers don’t engage the way they were expected. Nov. 22 – The sides speak again but the Blue Jays repeat that they can no longer do a deal for $80 million. Things remain deadlocked. Nov. 29 – The New York Mets reach agreement with free-agent outfielder Yoenis Cespedes on a $110-million, four-year deal. Many wonder if the deal will act as a catalyst in the market. It doesn’t. Yoenis Cespedes at a news conference in November. (Kevin Hagen/AP) Nov. 30 – The Blue Jays and the Encarnacion camp discuss the possibility of a three-year deal for the first time but there’s no traction as the financial gap remains wide. The squeeze is on. Meanwhile, by night’s end, owners and players agree on a new collective bargaining agreement, and news on the luxury tax threshold isn’t good for Encarnacion. In 2017, it will be set at $195 million, up only slightly from this year’s $189 million. It won’t be high enough to get the Red Sox and Yankees in the bidding. Dec. 3 – As the winter meetings near, Beltran signs a $16-million, one-year deal with the Astros, removing another potential landing spot for Encarnacion from the mix. Dec. 4 – The Blue Jays reach agreement with Steve Pearce on a $12.5-million, two-year deal on the eve of the winter meetings in National Harbor, Md., while the Yankees secure Matt Holliday for $13 million over one year. Once again the Encarnacion camp is blindsided, as a meeting with the Blue Jays is scheduled for the next day. Two more options are closed off as now the Blue Jays roster really is blocked off to Encarnacion. Dec. 5-8 – The Blue Jays and Encarnacion’s camp remain in touch but there’s no common ground at this point. With Morales and Pearce already on the roster, the only realistic scenario for the Blue Jays is a one, maybe a two-year deal. The market for Encarnacion is stronger than that, however, as surprising suitors enter the fray. Cleveland emerges as a possibility for the first time, while Oakland starts sniffing around. Texas monitors the situation, as well, as do the Colorado Rockies and St. Louis Cardinals. But nothing is imminent. Dec. 22 – Encarnacion’s free agency moves into the end game as Cleveland and Oakland make strong pushes to get a deal done. The Athletics are aggressive with an offer of $50 million for two years, a contract structure that would have allowed Encarnacion to re-enter the market ahead of his age 36 season and perhaps surpass the $80 million guarantee from the Blue Jays. But the allure of playing for an American League favourite in Cleveland is too strong, and agreement on a deal that guarantees Encarnacion $60 million over three years, with an option that could push the package up to $80 million over four, is reached. The resolution, even if not his first choice, is ultimately a good one for Encarnacion. Dec. 23 – Faint hopes of a reunion with Encarnacion now off the table, the Blue Jays begin to more aggressively pursue their remaining needs on the roster."

Oh I totally agree with you that hindsight is 20/20 and yes, this could have been avoided if they had taken care of this before the start of the 2016 season. I was under the impression that players are rewarded for their performance. Edwin has performed, without a doubt, so pay him for what he's worth. You can't take into consideration of what may or may not happen in the future, because time and time again, through the previous completed contract, EE has put up huge numbers and was a huge part in the Jays offence. The Jays ""tried"" to offer him a 2-year deal to him before the start of the 2016 season...That really is an insult because the Jays offered Smoak a two year $8.3 million contract, which in my opinion was not a smart move (made the Rangers record of 5 strikeouts in one game lol). There's no comparison between EE and Smoak...you don't offer an all-star player a 2 year contract.  When the Jays offered the $80 mil 4 year deal to EE after the fact, it was just to cover their own butts to give the appearance that ""oh we tried..."". I simply don't buy it. Why didn't they come out and offer that prior to the 2016 season and we could have avoided all of this?  There just doesn't seem to be any sincerity from the Jays management to sign players who produce, instead they rely on their ""stats"" to make their decisions.

989420,John Bacon,2016-12-24 20:03:00,3277,"  Oh I totally agree with you that hindsight is 20/20 and yes, this could have been avoided if they had taken care of this before the start of the 2016 season. I was under the impression that players are rewarded for their performance. Edwin has performed, without a doubt, so pay him for what he's worth. You can't take into consideration of what may or may not happen in the future, because time and time again, through the previous completed contract, EE has put up huge numbers and was a huge part in the Jays offence. The Jays ""tried"" to offer him a 2-year deal to him before the start of the 2016 season...That really is an insult because the Jays offered Smoak a two year $8.3 million contract, which in my opinion was not a smart move (made the Rangers record of 5 strikeouts in one game lol). There's no comparison between EE and Smoak...you don't offer an all-star player a 2 year contract.  When the Jays offered the $80 mil 4 year deal to EE after the fact, it was just to cover their own butts to give the appearance that ""oh we tried..."". I simply don't buy it. Why didn't they come out and offer that prior to the 2016 season and we could have avoided all of this?  There just doesn't seem to be any sincerity from the Jays management to sign players who produce, instead they rely on their ""stats"" to make their decisions. Signing Morales and Pearce doesn't come close to a player like EE.

Re: ""I was under the impression that players are rewarded for their performance.""- He was rewarded with an $80 million contract with an option to bring it up $100 million.  Unfortunately, he turned it down.  Re: ""When the Jays offered the $80 mil 4 year deal to EE after the fact, it was just to cover their own butts to give the appearance that ""oh we tried...- Seriously??? No other teams offered him that much.  Why would they offer above market value if they only wanted to give the appearance of trying to keep him.    Steve Pearce is another completely unspectacular player. If his addition to the team is handicapping their ability to go after solid, quality players then I really have no idea of what direction this team is going. It will be interesting to see if fans still show up in droves this year for what at this point is clearly looking like an inferior team. Then again, who knows, maybe they are about to pull the trigger on some kind of blockbuster deal that will bring a player with real impact to toronto. Kinda doubt it though... Pearce can play first, second, outfield, and perhaps some other positions as well.  He doesn't have a huge contract by baseball standards (I think he's getting $12 over two years).  I don't think that he is stopping them from signing other players; they can definitely find a place for Pearce, even if it's a backup role."
989421,FloatnFly,2016-12-24 21:33:00,1640,"Heres the thing, Jays made the offer 4 years, 80 million, with 3 different options for a 5th year of Edwins choosing. so 4years 20mil per year with a 5th year for 20 as an option.  The team Edwin wanted made an offer for the amount of money Edwin wanted, for the number of years Edwin wanted. When that happens, you don't sit around and make them wait while you go and play games on the FA market. When the team you want, offers everything you want, you sign the line and say I have found a home for the rest of my career.  FranktheRabbit, not sure how much you actually know about Shapiro and Atkins, but that offer to Edwin went against EVERYTHING they've done in the past. They wanted Edwin back 100%, they didn't want to sit and wait for his agent to play games while other teams we're signing up good players.  While Edwins agent was playing games, teams were filling out their rosters with players whos agents weren't playing games."

They have 5 outfielders in their system right that could easily see time in the bigs, outside of Pillar, Carrera, and Upton JR, they have Pompey, and then Anthony Alford, and cant forget about Cecilianni.  2: Edwins agent screwed him by waiting, every desirable team that was interested, Jays, Astros, Yankees, Rangers and Red Sox maybe, are now out because his agent waited.  3: Bautista, 1-2 years max, at 17mil per year. His range has diminished, his arm, non existant anymore, its average to below average since he hurt his rotator cuff in 2015 vs Baltimore on a stupid play  4: Jays outfield is in decent shape with Pillar, Carrera, Upton JR/Pompey, and Pearce can also play outfield. which means they can focus on rebuilding the bullpen, and possibly adding a starting pitcher (Doug Fister is a free agent) would be a good addition to the back end of the rotation, and then can swing liriano into the pen."

988129,FloatnFly,2016-12-08 02:25:00,1640,"EE is still the top free agent, that hasn't changed. Heres the problem, teams have a timeline, free agents have a timeline. Edwins agent said wait, find out what your value is, and get a ton of teams interested. problem is, teams were interested, they weren't interested in waiting over a month to figure out if 20 mil is or isn't available to them. Teams have moved on to their plan B, and went with cheaper, yet suitable alternatives.  One way I can see the Jays signing Edwin is this, they turn around and finalize Pearces contract, then trade him for pitching, or an outfielder, then sign Edwin. its a possibility, although unlikely."
988145,Acountdeleted,2016-12-08 13:16:00,2562,I don't see the Jays signing Edwin and I don't see him getting close to what the Jays initially offered him.  I'd be firing the agent as soon as I got this contract finished. Looks like they cost Eddie a lot of money.
988146,Headhunter,2016-12-08 13:44:00,5703,"Ok... a little math here. They signed Smoak to a two year 4 mill per season in the summer. Had they not done that, it would have freed up 4 mill per year to put towards EE. By not signing Jose, that's another $15 mill in budget space. So, there's roughly $20 mill unaccounted for in the budget. That's enough to get Edwin back. They also have the roughly $12 to $15 mill that EE got last year, still in the budget. I'm not far from calling shenanigans! HH"

He's like a .223 career hitter and completely one dimensional, showing occasional power. It's hard to imagine there isn't a power hitting prospect somewhere in the minors who couldn't equal or best his numbers if pressed into service at a fraction of the cost. Might even give fans something to get excited about. I also liked Ben Revere and Rajai Davis before him. He won the stolen base crown this year I believe which is pretty cool considering his age and limited playing time. Good for him."

Lot of signings still to go. Jays have 11 free agents. Darwin Barney is in that group as well."
986182,Old Ironmaker,2016-11-14 21:22:00,8243,"After a long hiatus away from the game for me as a fan I am amazed to see the salaries of Major League ball players today. It is far higher in MLB than a NFL player. There are only a hand full of impact Football players that make between 15 and 20 million a year. A Pro Bowl player might earn between 8 and 15 mil a year. The average playing career is far less for a NFLer as well. We aren't talking chump change in the NFL and my heart doesn't bleed for them, I am just surprised at the wage gap between the 2 games given that NFL teams make greater earnings than MLB teams do. Costs for a MLB team must be substantially higher for 162 games vs. 16.  This kid looks good, it would be nice to have 2 players of this caliber. I don't have an idea as far as his defensive skills are concerned."

986198,muddler,2016-11-14 23:46:00,623,"The Jays have every intention of being in the playoff hunt next year. Having another slugger signed is a real nice problem to have. I really hope that EE stays with the Jays. Man what a real potent batting line up that would be. Even with one or two of the top 6 batters in a slump it would still be formidable. Love it.  The pitching is very good to good but not great. Can't sign great new pitching then sign more great hitting. A win is a win, if they win 1-0 because great pitching or 17-16 because of great hitting,it's still a win. I like what the Jays are doing, working to put the possible team on the field that they can, not the best team ever but the best possible team. Remember all the other teams are trying to do the same thing. I like our chances for 2017. The Jays just got a little better.  MUD"
986200,Rizzo,2016-11-14 23:55:00,4754,they need to sign a few guys who can strike out a bit more. It was maddening watching them make some of the Cleveland pitchers look untouchable.
986257,fishing n autograph,2016-11-15 12:34:00,2540,Upton hasn't been a decent everyday player since he left Tampa. He wasn't very good in Atlanta.
986262,manitoubass2,2016-11-15 14:10:00,11391,Bautista and encarnacion are as good as gone
986276,Headhunter,2016-11-15 17:04:00,5703,"I'm beginning to think that the Jays front office is looking to change the team, more than keep what they have had. Objectively looking at the last two seasons, the Jays were essentially the same team. That team has proven twice, that they are just not good enough to win it all, close, but not quite there. So, management have decided that they have had their shot, their collective soft underbelly exposed and the realization has been made that this group just aren't able to move to the next level. I don't except them to sign either Jose or Edwing. I expect them to address the issues that have presented themselves, namely, more consistent hitting and left handed hitters. I am willing to let them do their thing, before I pass judgement on their decisions. HH"
986286,John Bacon,2016-11-15 18:29:00,3277,"Another signing by the Jays.   From what I understand he will need some time in the minors, so he is more of a long term decision.  https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2016/11/blue-jays-sign-lourdes-gurriel-cuba.html"
986364,netminder,2016-11-16 15:16:00,514,"I hate this speculation game... Just make some signings and start playing again!  I do really hope they do give EE another shot, throw the fans and a loyal player a bone. It'll be a while before he signs anywhere because he is probably the most sought after power hitter in this current free agent market. Jose, I'll be sad to see him go. He was my favourite player for the past few years and has provided a lot of great memories, but I don't think he is high on the priority list or part of the long term needs of this team.  I'm all for trading a bit of power for some speed, contact and a look at the left side of the plate or a switch hitter. The Jays have sufficient power even if they lose EE and JB with the likes of Donaldson, Martin and Tulowitzki (of course they have to play up to their reputation too). It's going to be a different team next year for sure, and I doubt there are going to be any defensive holes."
986368,manitoubass2,2016-11-16 15:36:00,11391,Wasnt EE offered 80 for 4?  All I can do is shake my head thinking thats not enough
986385,John Bacon,2016-11-16 17:01:00,3277,"I do really hope they do give EE another shot,  He already has been give another shot.  It is just a matter of whether he takes what the Jays are will to pay, or look for a higher bidder."
986390,manitoubass2,2016-11-16 17:05:00,11391,"Didnt EE and Bautista already decline qualifying offers?   Thats what I seen.  And TO isnt gonna go higher, so IMO they are both gone"
986395,John Bacon,2016-11-16 17:14:00,3277,"Didnt EE and Bautista already decline qualifying offers?   Thats what I seen.  And TO isnt gonna go higher, so IMO they are both gone Qualifying are not intended to be accepted.  It is just an administrative procedure to ensure the Jays will get a draft pick if the players sign with someone else.  Declining the qualifying offer does not prevent the player from signing a more generous and/or longer term contract with the Jays.  But they are also free to talk to other teams as well."
