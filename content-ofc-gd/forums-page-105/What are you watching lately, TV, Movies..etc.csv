T.O. lost a lot of character Downtown after the clean up.   All is not lost OI, I see the Zanzibar is still on Yonge. Do you remember the Old Victory Burlequse Theatre on Spadina at Dundas? went there first year university in 69, think it closed shortly thereafter. Classic old school burlesque ."

The show has been amazing but after 12 years i think its finally getting a little stale. Pretty amazing considering it usually only takes a series 4-5 seasons to burn out if that. Still funny, still following it, but its lost a little something. Kinda like a legendary band still trying to put out new music but just not able to recreate the hits like they used to.  Having said that, Any fans of the show should check out Sweet D's new series ........""The Mick"".......Its hilarious  Im also a ""dead head""..........not the grateful kind but the walking kind  I still hold hope they knock out a few amazing episodes a season....first episode wasn't amazing but certainly a balsy way to start the season, and i did get that ""what are the ruleees"" stuck in my head for awhile afterwards lol.  Last seasons ""Mac and Dennis move to the Suburbs"" was outstanding"

As far as the Old Vic where Long John Baldry did shows and ""Tricky Ricky Days Extravaganza"" of course I have never been to a dive like that. If I did go there I could still smell the carpet soaked in draught Beer and cigarette butts of both types, some still lit. The House of Lancaster is still going strong I hear."

Great show  Had watched the first 5 seasons while in Nunavut last winter.  Got home, told Bren she's gotta check it out, she got hooked, and so ended up re-watching it all again... Almost as good the second time and you're right Terry.  Finishing up Luke Cage which is so-so.  Just finished Marco Polo and Suits which I thought were both good.  Need to get back onto Narcos.  Walking Dead died for me a few seasons back but, it's my 17 years old's favorite show and part of our weekly quality time and convos so it good that this season they've taken it up a notch.  So far been liking most of it.  Dana Carvey's recorded stand-up show had me laughing through one morning too."

990944,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-13 07:20:00,8243,"I just watched a great little movie from 2005 on APTN last week. It was so compelling I watched it through those waste of life things selling stuff.  The 3 Burials of Malaquides Estrada staring Tommy Lee Jones, Barry Pepper and a young skinny January Jones of Mad Men fame and Melissa Leo, she's great in everything she does in my mind.  I didn't recognize January Jones right off the Bat. Based on real events and normally I would end it there but obviously that character dies and is buried 3 times. Estrada is killed by a Border Patrol Agent and it is Rancher Jones pal. He finds out who killed him and he makes Peppers character take the body to Mexico to be properly buried.  You have to see it. I don't know how I missed it as I am a bit of a movie buff. It has sex, no drugs and no rock and roll and it is still a great movie. I speak a bit of Spanish and  I was surprised that Tommy Lee Jones spoke perfect Spanish/Mexican in the movie. Man can he handle a horse, no stunt guy, he showed off riding a bit. Maybe I shouldn't be surprised I think he is a Texan.  Thanks for the trailers ckewley. I did see a few of them. I saw Batman/Superman on the Movie Chanel Saturday and I was surprisingly entertained. I read nothing but bad reviews for it so didn't bother to rent it. I could not believe the muscle mass on Ben Affleck, can that be done with CGI rather than anabolic steroids? You don't get that big working out with very heavy weights, a great diet and a great trainer 5 days a week for a year straight. It takes years to get that big naturally, years not months. There's only 1 magic pill for that.  It was entertaining which is what a movie is supposed to do. Some people expect a movie to change their lives and it doesn't so they pan it.  Neon Demon was on the other night, I tried to get through it but not for me. My wife who is a strange woman loved it and Lobster too.  Favorite movie of the year Deadpool. It had the same vibe as Guardians of the Galaxy. Comic book Action comedy ridiculous category. Deadpool has a chance to win an Oscar for Best Movie and will be the first Comic Book based movie to do that and there have been a few great Batman's made.  I said a few pages before I didn't see anything I really liked but have seen a few new movies for free since that I really liked.  Jason Bourne was OK, that's about it, maybe I wasn't in the mood. He is massive in this movie too. Maybe he and buddy Ben worked out together and shared their Gatorade laced with Testosterone."

It feels like a porno you could only see on Younge Street back in the seedy days of Younge Street.  Look at the guy sitting at the head of the table on the left side of the shot. It could be Vince Vaughn's Father. Something that would never get past editing today is the round shinny Art? on the wall behind the actress. In many shots of her it looks like a big shinny hat or a halo. I love those old 70's and 80's flicks. So bad they are good. Like the show on Spike TV. Americas Worst Tenants, something like that. Man it is so bad a ""reality TV"" show I can't wait till it airs. Today a tenant had a horse in her bedroom, but the steroid laced investigator never noticed the smell, they only realized there was a horse crapping on the bedroom floor after they opened the door.

And I never realized that the Amish were such tough criminals, La Cosa Nostra has nothing on those God fearing folk.  As of now Ray Donavan is our Sunday guilty pleasure. Then I a few weeks the cliff hanger of the Walking Dead will be unfolded on Sunday Oct/24.  Can't wait foe ""All about Saul"" another well done AMC production. No way to explain that comedy/drama/musical/Cineme Noir.  I like to catch 60 Minutes Sports when I can find it."

He was the original Bufford Pusser in the ""Walking Tall"" movies in the 70's. The only good ol' southern boy with a Swedish accent. Too funny.  The last time I checked we didn't have enough band width to get a good system out here in the boonies. We have Xplornet,  A friend down the lakeshore has a ""Blackbox"" but they need to download a movie an hour or something before they watch it. Nothing live. I would love to get rid of our $140.00 Bell satellite bill asap. Can I get anything better than that ""Blackbox"" rurally now if anyone might know? There has to be something out there now or is it primarily an urban system? Live sports is a must. Basically everything else is pre taped anyway except the news."

978010,scuro2,2016-07-29 16:35:00,904,"Also, better call Saul. It spends a lot of time on character development and spends money on production. Unlike breaking bad, it's not so over the top...with limited violence so far. Season 1 is on Netflix"
978033,netminder,2016-07-29 19:57:00,514,"Nothing really on regular television right now that I usually watch... but I have been watching and thoroughly enjoying Stranger Things. Love the music and it is very well acted.  When they're on I've been watching...  The Walking Dead - although the finale of last season left A LOT to be desired... not sure if I want to carry on with that show. I usually just watch it to complain about how stupid the characters are.  Game of Thrones - Maybe recency bias, but this is right up there with my favourite show of all time, if not the best ever. So big, grand, complicated, dark and violent.  Better Call Saul -  Is a weekly staple. I think I might like it just as much as Breaking Bad.  It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia - My favourite comedy series going right now. Although I have to search for it usually to find it since I don't get it on cable and Canadian Netflix doesn't carry it.  Longmire - And I'm not sure why because it's not really like anything else I watch. Maybe I just love the Wyoming scenery or the fact that I wish I could be more like Longmire in real life lol.  The wife and I are usually movie junkies, but we haven't really found any lately and haven't been to the theatre in a while. The best movies I've seen lately are independent types movies, two that come to mind (just because I watched them recently and I'll tell everyone to watch them until they do) are:  What We Do in the Shadows    And Bone Tomahawk   Polar opposites in movie genre, I know, but both excellent in their own rights."
978034,netminder,2016-07-29 19:58:00,514,"If you liked the movie Fargo you will like seasons 1 & 2. Probably the best TV series of the last two years  Oh, and almost forgot... I missed season 1 of Fargo, but season 2 was amazing. reminds me I still need to find season 1 somewhere!"

I'm glad Old Ironmaker mentioned Deadwood,without a doubt one of the greatest shows of all time. Don't know if you watched Justified but you can tell Olyphant had pull to get a lot of Deadwood's cast rolls in that show.  Watched a oldie but goodie (relatively speaking)  "

If it has a commercial every 4 minutes I will not watch it, even watching the news bothers me with the interminable commercials that insults our intelligence.  I would put Deadwood in the top 10 of all time...along with the Wire. Band of Brothers and The Pacific also would go on that list."

Game of thrones, Mr. Robot, Fargo, Better Call Saul....those are my tops for shows still running.  The walking dead is a little ridiculous but i still love it as well.  Fargo season 2 was some of my favorite TV I've ever watched, so so so cool....great music"

Ill watch a bit of this and that as well, any fishing with muskie or pike or anything comedy."
979241,Dutch01,2016-08-12 00:07:00,1431,"I agree completely, one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. I still crack up at episodes I've seen 3 times. It's pretty raunchy for a cartoon too."

The John Voight character just gets into all manner of zany high jinx, like having fake sex with his dead cell mate to get into protective custody for LGBT prisoners because the Russian Mob is trying to kill him as well as others including his son Ray. Ray has put that hit on hold for now.  A PG rating."

977372,ckewley,2016-07-23 03:29:00,699,"The music thread is a pretty good indication that there's a wide variety of personal likes & dislikes among this group & as much as I dig music, movies are more to my liking. To be more specific I grew up on the great B-flicks of the 70's-80's & the DTV (direct to video) flicks of the early 90's. The vast majority of cinemas that used to play the greats have long gone, at least in Toronto, but they live on in video/digital format. I have over 3000 DVD's & Blu Rays (most titles folks have never heard of) & still a huge VHS collection (300+ last count). My hopes are that whatever you're watching, whether it be a TV show of today or yesterday or film you might post it here, hopefully introducing everyone to something new or missed. I'll start with 2 films I watched tonight. Both are from the 80's ( one from 1990) when big hair & big explosions ruled the day. PC Bulls#*t was non existent in the heyday which makes these films all the more enjoyable. Both films were from the same director, who had a somewhat short directing career in terms of theatrical films, but the films he had released are solid gold in my books. Film #1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AvMn2Vh0fQ  Film #2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pim4GLxxr00  Both films I give a thumbs up"

The plots are flimsy and predicable. Way too much computer graphics in action movies and just too much foul language. Cancelled cable. I don't miss it one bit.  I read 6 papers on line every day to keep up with the news. CNN and FOX are a joke and the Canadian news station weren't much better.

HBO, Showtime and others all put out weekly series with ZERO commercials that feel like you have watched a 1 hour movie every week. Game of Thrones, Ray Donavan, Shameless, True Detective, Outcast and many weekly series that are no longer in production. The best ever was Deadwood. Many people I know have never heard of these shows because they have cable. If it has a commercial every 4 minutes I will not watch it, even watching the news bothers me with the interminable commercials that insults our intelligence.  Turner Movie Network TMN has oldie movies from the silent era to 60's commercial free. If you are a movie buff you have to get it anyway you can.
