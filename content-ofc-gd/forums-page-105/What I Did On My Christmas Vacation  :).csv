989721,DRIFTER_016,2016-12-31 17:52:00,10439,Been working on rebuilding my laker trolling stick over the holidays. It was beginning to show it's age and needed a refresh.    Stripped it down to the bare blank and built me a sexy looking handle. Just finished installing it last night.    Still have to install guides and do a cool looking butt wrap but have tons of time before the ice goes out.

989745,DRIFTER_016,2017-01-01 03:06:00,10439,I've been hanging out with a bunch of miscreants that are into doing crazy stuff with EVA foam and thread lately. Getting ready to start building retirement saltwater fishing sticks and need to practice.  http://www.northeastrodbuilders.com/  https://www.facebook.com/groups/198581950187042/
989747,Tom S,2017-01-01 04:08:00,362,"Hanging out with the NERBs, eh?  A bit flashier than I personally like, but it looks like some good tight work. Now you've got to come up with some wraps to match."
989779,huzzsaba,2017-01-01 21:08:00,884,Wow!  Looks awesome!
989855,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-02 18:11:00,8243,"Nice job Dave. I like my stuff a bit less flashy. I even might beat up my stuff so no one would ever think about putting the gleep on it. The big dent on my tailgate I did when I Christened the new Silverado at 2500 KMS is still there 5 years latter. They steal them out here in Haldimand for the tailgates amongst other parts, not mine, or my beat up looking rods."
