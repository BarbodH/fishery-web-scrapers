991805,PUMP KNOWS,2017-01-19 00:02:00,937,"^^^ That's what I need.  thanks for the heads up, I never been to a Sayal before"
990778,PUMP KNOWS,2017-01-11 17:55:00,937,I found these 2 units at my local CT.  Humminbird Helix 5 Sonar Fish Finder  $159.93 http://www.humminbird.com/Products/HELIX-5-SONAR/  Humminbird Helix 5 DI Fish Finder  $194.93 http://www.humminbird.com/Products/HELIX-5-DI/   I was looking to convert one of them for ice fishing.  Anyone have any experience with these units?  Which one would you recommend?  I'm a complete noob when it comes to fish finders.
990780,porkpie,2017-01-11 18:00:00,2521,"Buy the one without DI if it's just for ice fishing.  Both will work but no need for DI on the ice, and yes I had a down imaging humminbird that I used on the ice for a while.  I've gone back to standard sonar!"
990781,chris.brock,2017-01-11 18:12:00,4053," I have a Helix 5 SI that I use in the boat and for ice fishing.  I'm not the most tech savvy, I have played with the settings, but I have no use for SI or DI in the boat or on the ice.  I really like the unit though and that's a great price (a hell of a lot less than I paid, lol)"
990783,Bass Tard,2017-01-11 19:03:00,128,I thought I understood that the DI only works when you're moving?!   I may be wrong..
990794,BassMan11,2017-01-11 23:40:00,583,For just ice fishing there is no need for the DI. You need to be moving for it to have a good return.  If you plan on using it for maybe back lake and trips and stuff as well as ice fishing the DI is great.
990798,PUMP KNOWS,2017-01-12 00:48:00,937,Thanks guys.  I'll go with the Sonar unit
990807,Musky Plug,2017-01-12 12:54:00,398,If I'm not mistaken the helix units come with a built in flasher.
990813,AKRISONER,2017-01-12 13:42:00,5558,"If I'm not mistaken the helix units come with a built in flasher.  so important! A lot of sonars have a flasher function, i know my pop's humminbird does. The flasher is the ultimate key when ice fishing Pump"
990815,Sinker,2017-01-12 13:45:00,8692,I hate the flasher function. Graph for me always.  S.
990816,AKRISONER,2017-01-12 13:49:00,5558,I hate the flasher function. Graph for me always.  S. 
990817,chris.brock,2017-01-12 14:15:00,4053," It does have a built in flasher. You younger guys are more adept at these electronics than me, but I don't use the flasher. I'm always on a split screen with regular sonar and 4x or 6x zoom on the bottom."
990825,AKRISONER,2017-01-12 15:47:00,5558,"IMO nothing beats slowly wiggling a jig right infront of a fishes nose raising it off the bottom to get it to trigger to strike all in real time with a flasher. But to each their own. I fished with a graph and it was great for reaction strikes, but that super finnesse take is always a challenge without a flasher."
990831,Joeytier,2017-01-12 16:05:00,3990,"A high quality graph (like the Helix) will provide just as much detail as a flasher, especially if you dial in the zoom properly.  Even my crappy little PirahnaMax.  I understand why people prefer flashers, and if I could afford a good quality flasher and a portable unit for backlake ID have both, but I can't so a good portable graph does both very well"
990865,porkpie,2017-01-12 21:22:00,2521,"I fished with a flasher for years, and went to a GPS/sonar unit with flasher option about 3 years ago.  I never use the flasher anymore.  Modern sonars are so responsive there is no need to!"
991085,Freshtrax,2017-01-14 00:00:00,2215,Thanks for the heads up I just grabbed one at local store for the ice / tinner duty little trouble getting them to pricematch. nice upgrade from the old pira√±a max.
991089,porkpie,2017-01-14 00:23:00,2521,"If you contact humminbird in Burlington,they will exchange the open water transducer for an ice ducer for no charge if the transducer is unused!"
991095,Freshtrax,2017-01-14 01:02:00,2215,Nice didn't know that.   I will be using it in open water too I ve had no issues with the regular ducers in the past through the ice.

991764,PUMP KNOWS,2017-01-18 21:31:00,937,Pulled the trigger today for $159.93  Now I need to find a cheap rechargeable battery to go with the unit.  Any suggestions?
