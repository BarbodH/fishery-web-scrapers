I got to Florida for the holidays so I have some vitamin C built up and I'm not to jealous of you 2 this year.There isn't any snow here, haven't used the shovel. I hope they have cleared the mouth of the river. There is pack ice to Caledonia not moving. I was in town today and it was pouring hard. The storm sewers were backing up in front of Giant Tiger and the $ store."
