991042,shimano19,2017-01-13 20:07:00,196,Had some spare time today so I decided to make a holder for the ice rods instead of a bucket. Keeps them organized and tangle free!

991072,Jds63,2017-01-13 22:27:00,1365,"Looks great , thanks for sharing !"
991074,GBW,2017-01-13 22:36:00,8460,"Nice set up.  I mounted cut tube sections like to the outside of my bucket for the same idea, tangle fee and safe storage."
