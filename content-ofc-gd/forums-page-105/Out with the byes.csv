991139,misfish,2017-01-14 19:25:00,29133,A short video from this morning.  Sorry for the one cus word. Leave it to Terry.LOL  
991146,wkrp,2017-01-14 20:29:00,656,Nice going byes.
991153,Rizzo,2017-01-14 21:18:00,4754,just a few people out on the ice out there! some nice looking fish tho
991154,ketchenany,2017-01-14 21:25:00,3229,You pulled down Terry's zipper; OMG! and he cussed? nice going guys. Don't tell anyone where the ice is!
991157,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-14 21:37:00,8243,"You did very well with the video. Spielberg doesn't have to worry about for a bit boy. Terry has more computer power at his disposal than the entire control room in Houston NASA did in the 60's, and I am probably 100% right.  Any reason yer can't show da faces of da byes der? Are their photos hanging at Canada Customs crossings or the Post Office?  Are those Whitefish or?  Please post GPS co ordinates for those here lurking as spam bots."
991163,CJGuelph,2017-01-14 22:21:00,16,"Nice, sure are lots of guys out fishing!!"
991164,kickingfrog,2017-01-14 22:29:00,8333,That's a solid whitefish. That ice looks good enough to skate on.
991165,Terry,2017-01-14 22:37:00,14456,N71 58.490 W94 54.909  fun to get out but the ice was a little thin for my comfort zone
991166,ketchenany,2017-01-14 22:41:00,3229,"OI, Hte byes are of the Newf'and' Land order and they are a  secretive folk, only when they dab in screech. No faces and no location will be given.  Terry has lots of power, the man is a fishfinder, aka Sir Terry Lawrence.  . .  And I bet that it was less that 30 ftw."
991167,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-14 22:45:00,8243,"How thick, or should I say thin Terry. Last time out it was a bit over 2"" the first day we went to BOQ. I sat in the truck listening to the radio and cooking.  Something I wanted to mention Brian. At the beginning of the documentary you said there were about 200 of your ""friends"" on the ice. Are they like Farcebook friends? My former wife's page says she has 200 friends, yea right, she don't know 200 people.  Ketch my pissan, we were posting at the same time. Kind of like a Sicilian, I can tell you but then I have to feed you.  Going to the boot this summer pissano, thought I'd let you know. PM me about from where you guys are from, I knew but forget. It will be the 2 of us with no itinerary, off the beaten path, no Autosrada if we can help it. 3 weeks."
991168,manitoubass2,2017-01-14 22:52:00,11391,"50 are friends and family.  The rest? Who knows?  My wife has 400 or so ""friends"" and id consider us very secluded and anti social."
991169,Terry,2017-01-14 22:52:00,14456,most areas where 3 inches   i saw some 2.5   and the spud went through with one hit in a couple of places   i like 3 hits to feel safe

That's a solid whitefish. That ice looks good enough to skate on.  That was what I was thinking Rob on the way in. Quick escape.

991283,LeXXington,2017-01-16 00:12:00,1928,Great vid!  little thin for me but looks fun
991515,fishingwithbob,2017-01-17 17:49:00,123,at least now we know the lock screen combo for Terry's phone
991517,Acountdeleted,2017-01-17 17:57:00,2562,His phone only has pics of Whitefish on it anyways.
991519,jimmer,2017-01-17 18:31:00,2730,"It sure looks like people don't have any fears, that ice looks thin.  Oh well, the early bird gets the whitefish!  Thanks for sharing a fishing report!"
991523,manitoubass2,2017-01-17 18:55:00,11391,Those are some good size whities! Is that average for the area? Bigger/smaller?  Looks like a blast!
