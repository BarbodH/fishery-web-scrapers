991566,TJQ,2017-01-18 00:08:00,7806,Had someone ask me if there are Northern Pike in Rice Lake??  I said I dunno??  But I know where to find out .lol  soooooo....   are there pike in Rice Lake??
991567,Locnar,2017-01-18 00:11:00,645,"According to MNR, no. But I have heard a few reports of them. Don't know if it's misidentification, or if they've gotten in."
991569,GBW,2017-01-18 00:20:00,8460,TJ I have seen pic's of them caught posted in Rice and recently Scugog as well.  PIC proof.  Not natural and 100% invasive.
991570,MJL,2017-01-18 00:30:00,2427,There are definitely pike in Rice Lake. I caught one last summer. I also caught a tiger musky on the next cast...  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=82526&hl=%2Besox+%2Bsoul
991573,ecmilley,2017-01-18 01:22:00,2163,Some northerns have got in above hastings as well as some gar. Pike will be moving through entire system.soon enough
991576,Locnar,2017-01-18 02:01:00,645,Gar is around hastings eh? Interesting. And Pike in Scugog... that doesn't bode well for the muskies.
991579,GBW,2017-01-18 02:12:00,8460,"And Pike in Scugog... that doesn't bode well for the muskies. Seen the 1st pic this fall and it was NOT a tiger, 100% pike...  About mid 30's too"
991656,Beans,2017-01-18 15:21:00,3339,"As I understand it, the Kawartha area waters ran over limestone mostly which affected the ph balance that pike were not campatible with...maybe the pollution over the years have changed this...Simcoe has pike and the Bay of Quinte has pike so it was just a matter of time that they showed up in the Kawartha System...that would also explain where the crappie came from..."
991657,fishindevil,2017-01-18 15:30:00,6254,"there is 100% confirmed pike in rice lake as is a few of the other kawartha lakes it just takes years to verify as I went through this a few years ago in a lake in haliburton,trying to tell the MNR there was pike in a certain system,and they didn't believe me till I actually caught more and took pics,then they tell me they want a scale sample....they finally caught one in a net and then confirmed they are there so it is a process to get a species confirmed in a body of water..."
991660,manitoubass2,2017-01-18 15:42:00,11391,A time stamped GPS on photo is not enough???  A simple picture shows date time and location  Silly MNR

The PH explanation sounds a little far fetched to me.  The Kawartha Lakes have existed for less than 200 years.  The weren't in the Kawartha Lakes hundreds of years ago because the lakes didn't exist.  I think it has just taken this long for them to spread into the new habitat."
991680,captpierre,2017-01-18 17:11:00,2521,I have mixed feelings about the pike in the Kawarthas. Yes they will pressure the Muskie. And may wipe them out in 20+ yrs. I like a good fish fry. Sometimes slot eyes are hard for me to catch on Pigeon especially in the summer. Pike don't have a slot and are good eating if deboned. Not sure how they will impact the rest of the game fish. ?
991715,manitoubass2,2017-01-18 19:01:00,11391,Some lakes have zero issues housing musky and pike.  Look at LOTWs for example.  Every species thrives in that lake
991722,John Bacon,2017-01-18 19:21:00,3277,"Some lakes have zero issues housing musky and pike.  Look at LOTWs for example.  Every species thrives in that lake True, but those are usually bigger deeper lakes.  And the muskies that live in those lakes are a different strain than the ones that live in the Kawarthas.  I don't think the Kawartha muskies will do well with pike."
991737,OhioFisherman,2017-01-18 19:57:00,6623,"I went to Rice Lake once with my dad back in the 60's, it and the Kawartha lakes at that time were not supposed to have pike in them, that was a choice of lakes limiter for him."
991739,manitoubass2,2017-01-18 20:00:00,11391,"Yeah, my comment wasnt to say everything will be fine.  I dont know the chain of lakes so Im just learning from whats been said on here in numerous threads, and from alot of knowledgeable and passionate anglers.  I hope it doesnt cause issues for the lake(s) and or there is a reasonable solution.  If I was there, id be teaching people to fillet pike."
991745,GBW,2017-01-18 20:14:00,8460,"Yeah Rick the musky here are a different strain and are very, well, fragile.  They don't ""play well with others"" I have been told from the musky guru's.  Hence the reason I gave up fishing for them..."
