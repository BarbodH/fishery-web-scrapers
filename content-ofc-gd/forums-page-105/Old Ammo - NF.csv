990730,Tom S,2017-01-11 02:18:00,362,"My brother found a handful of old rifle and handgun ammunition in a wall while renovating his older house. Not sure how old they are, not overly corroded or damaged or anything like that. A couple look like they might be either 9mm or .38 caliber rounds, the others I'm guessing as .303 blanks (necked down cartridge, top is crimped over).  What's the best way for him to make sure that this ammo is decommissioned if he wants to keep it as a memento? Toss them in some water for a while?"

990736,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-11 02:58:00,8243,"Tom, take them down to Al Simmons gun shop on Locke St. in Hamilton and they will fix you up. I dealt with them for years when I was at the Hamilton gun club on #20 in Binbrook way back when, Simmons and the gang were the best around. I haven't heard great things about the gun shop on 3# in Simcoe. I just saw a new Hunting/ fishing shop driving through Binbrook today. It is in the new plaza on the west side of 56 south of the main intersection in the same building as the Dentists. Heck maybe with some of the crazy names new retailers have it might be a ladies dress shop.  Just a thought maybe give a gun club a call or email for advise. Why would someone bury ammo in a wall?"

No idea on hiding them in a wall, as long as they aren't in a humid area corrosion would be low and slow?  I had a VFW across the street from me growing up, they were always giving 21 gun salutes. Blanks for an M - 1 Garand and British Enfield rifles were probably a lot more common years ago?  Base of the pistol cartridge may have a caliber on it? No idea on the cost of having a gun shop disable cartridges."

And when we moved, I did lol. Good thing the house I rented was sold to a childhood friend. He let me take out the drywall to recover them. I put it back up afterwards. Cost me ?24? glass bottles"
990750,Tom S,2017-01-11 12:31:00,362,"No idea why the ammo would be in the wall. Maybe home defense? Rifle blanks to give them something to think about, pistol rounds in case that doesn't work?"
