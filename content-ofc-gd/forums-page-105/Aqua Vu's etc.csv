990358,skdds,2017-01-07 17:53:00,195,"Hi guys,  I am thinking about getting an ice fishing camera this year-one of the aqua vu's or similar camera's to add to the ice fishing collection.  I was at BPS recently, and I was thinking either the AV 715 c or one of the AV micros. Any feedback would be appreciated. The 715 seems kinda heavy and the micro maybe less durable? What are the better camera's these days?  Probably will buy from BPS, have a gift card to contribute, Santa was good to me this year!  Thanks,  Skdds"
990361,Fisherman,2017-01-07 18:26:00,7201,The price they want for the one with 100' of cable is nuts.  If I was to buy one I would go this route instead. http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Eyoyo-30M-7-Monitor-Infrared-Fish-Finder-Underwater-Recorder-DVR-Camera-Battery-/141859774826?hash=item210780616a:g:VN8AAOSwk1JWePpk At least you can get all the way down to where the whities hide.

990383,skdds,2017-01-07 21:49:00,195,Never heard of Eyoyo..I'll look through amazon as well...I'll post about the micro if I go that route
990445,Phil 65,2017-01-08 17:30:00,37,Go for the best one you can afford / 100 cable is great with the clarity of Simcoe . I learned more in 2days watching with the aqua view than 30 years from the top side
990451,Sterling,2017-01-08 18:56:00,477,"Just beware, I remember reading a thread about ""best & worst fishing purposes you've made"" and the aquavu was #1 worst purchase for many people."
990463,buick14,2017-01-08 21:03:00,741,U will waste a ton of money if u don't buy the best because you won't like the screen quality

LOL  I  just like to watch the vids guys make from these toys.

990534,DanD,2017-01-09 12:02:00,2223,"A few years back I bought one of the knock off systems, I found on Ebay. I was pretty impressed with it, in the shallow (10-15') waters of Long Point Bay. Went to lake Simcoe and ran it down to about 50'; it lasted about 10 minutes and the screen went dark. Brought the camera in to find it full of water and all the circuitry shorted out. I couldn't have lost that $200.00 any faster at the casino.  Dan."
990554,fishermccann,2017-01-09 16:02:00,655,I have an Aqua-view 360 with the 4 cameras. It works great on Simcoe when you have 4 guys with 8 lines down the big hole. Only problem is the 50 foot cable does not let you go deep.
990555,Fang,2017-01-09 16:05:00,1330,"disposable income = underwater camera  I have (had) 2!  They're fun in the right circumstances and it usually involves a hut, kids and crystal clear water is a must  To be honest the only time I found it useful was shallow water perch fishing on Simcoe and I use my Aquavu Micro now on a 15' golf ball retriever to walk trout stream and check out what are the best undercuts and runs  Saw one of the 4.3""  $100 ebay models running last ice season. no difference to the micro I have except it seemed a little lite on the powerpack through the day"
990571,JoshS,2017-01-09 18:19:00,729,I've been mulling over getting one for years but always hear bad things. I'm dying to see how fish react to my baits.  Has anyone had success with any that allow you to get down to the depths?
