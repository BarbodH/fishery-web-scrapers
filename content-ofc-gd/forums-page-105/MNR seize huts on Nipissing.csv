991637,pics,2017-01-18 14:15:00,1268,The North Bay Nugget had a few stories on him..  He had a license to operate on Nosbonsing but the ice was too thin.  He defied the MNRF and moved his huts to Nip anyways due to what he calls safety reasons.  He also accuses license holders of extortion because they won't sell him theirs.. He's a piece of work..

If I found them to be in contravention of the regulations  I would see that they are charged but if pulling a status card allows them to betray my trust and thumb their noses at me and the law, they are not welcome at my business. That being said, this guy is obviously a train off the rails with some of the stuff but I do see his point on the status thing."

When you are under someones roof you abide by their rules. Hut opporators have to make a living too. They put their huts on good holes to drum up business. If someone cleans the hole out, its going to make it tough on repeat business.  When I was working in Ear Falls (there is a name drop) I stayed on a lodge at Bluffy lake. One of the best guys I have ever met in my life, Keith ran the lodge and had 3 simple rules. 1) What happens at Bluffy Lake stays at Bluffy Lake. 2) Don't keep any walleye between 19-26 inches. 3) Don't fish off the dock. (they had a pet pike).  The last two rules had nothing to do with legislation and law. It was a respect thing. And don't ask about Rule 1. I'll never tell."

Likely has a lot to do with why they won't show the actual carbon tax on our bills"
991709,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-18 18:41:00,8243,"Is racism isn't against the law in Canada?  It's not in the USA. From Nazi's to White Supremists they are all allowed to express their their opinion. They can't infringe on someone's rights. I recall years ago the teacher out west preaching racism in his class. There was a court case. I know he got fired but can't remember much after that. I don't know about this Human Rights Tribunal thing. He didn't deny anyone's rights he said he would. I don't think there is such a thing as conspiracy to commit racism. He is an idiot though, not against the law either.  I remember now, the teacher was saying the Holocaust was a hoax."
991711,manitoubass2,2017-01-18 18:48:00,11391,"I think the concensus is that it is not illegal to just say racist remarks.  But a person subject to racism can get in touch with human rights tribunal and give the offending party quite the issues.  Its a weird subject. Ever watch ""Family Guy""?  The show says some pretty outlandish stuff but I guess its okay under the pretext of satire???  I really dont know?  Its just not a good idea to say such things. Nothing good can come of it thats for sure."

991471,manitoubass2,2017-01-17 14:01:00,11391,Thanks dutch!  Seen the news late last night.  Good for him
991472,netminder,2017-01-17 14:03:00,514,Oh I bet the MNR reads this forum regularly. If they were smart anyway...

991475,AKRISONER,2017-01-17 14:10:00,5558,"logic would tell you that the MNR would be on every major ontario fishing forum keeping an eye out for things and looking for tips.  some of the general conversation around here about things that people are witnessing on a regular basis has to be getting flagged. Maybe im crazy but ive noticed a massive jump in enforcement in Pointe Au Baril over the past few years, specifically during the fall pickerel run...maybe my complaints have something to do with it?!  hmm what a thought! I hope its maybe true? I am glad to see this guy get pinched, he deserves every bit of it."
991477,Tjames09,2017-01-17 14:27:00,664,Wasn't this the incredibly racist guy? Who posted probably the worst Kijiji ad ever.

991479,manitoubass2,2017-01-17 14:30:00,11391,Yeah its the guy I posted about a week or so back in the thread that got locked down

I was charged once and one neighbour said to me you must be guilty otherwise it wouldn't be in the newspaper. Well there you go, I confess."
991484,manitoubass2,2017-01-17 14:41:00,11391,Id say fraud.  Operating without a license  Dutch had posted some possible charges about the racist remarks he made but im not sure that would gain traction?  We'll see I suppose as its now up to the authorities.  I will say it doesnt look good when the OPP are present during the removal of the huts. Ive never seen that unless there were possible charges outside of natural resource issues
991485,ketchenany,2017-01-17 14:43:00,3229,Yeah its the guy I posted about a week or so back in the thread that got locked down The CBC did a story on him also.
991486,manitoubass2,2017-01-17 14:45:00,11391,Never seen that. Id did see a CBC article. Ill have to see if I can find it on their website.
991487,manitoubass2,2017-01-17 14:49:00,11391,"OI, I had to look at the thread to refresh my memory, but Dutch had said in reference to the ad and other racist remark he could face serious trouble had he been reported to the Human Rights Tribunal.  But thats not a thing im familiar with. I have zero idea what kind of things could come from that possibilty"
