990337,Big Cliff,2017-01-07 08:59:00,6899,"I know this question has been posted before but I'm looking for current information. I'm thinking of getting away for a couple of days with my son and am considering Nipissing. Anyone been out this year, any recommendations for operators. I'm looking for something clean and well maintained/serviced where we can spend a couple of days."
990346,ketchenany,2017-01-07 13:40:00,3229,"Cliff I've been once a long time ago and I may be wrong but the bungalow had to be at full capacity. So two of you may have to pay for the the difference! We were one short and I think we got away with it, but not sure. Also we got this song and dance about dropping stuff in the holes. When I started bringing stuff up they said it happens! Whata bunch of crap that was! Mind you we did get fish."
990347,bobowski,2017-01-07 13:47:00,360,"I'm heading up to nipissing next weekend. Staying with Bear Creek Cottages (Idle Tyme). I havent stayed with them before but I hear nothing but good things about them. They have cottages, Ice Bungalows and day huts. There have been some pretty good reports coming from his bungalows so far this year. Seems as though the slot size is helping the walleye population."
990351,Big Cliff,2017-01-07 15:35:00,6899,I would really appreciate it if you share your thoughts and experience when you return. I stayed with Anglers Haven years ago and they treated us well but I can only afford one trip a year like this so I would like it to be a good one (mind you any time spent with my son is good time lol)
990354,Locnar,2017-01-07 16:40:00,645,"I am interested as well in possibly renting an ice bungalow, wondering what sort of prices there are... Species I'm assuming is mostly walleye and perch? Burbot?"
990355,Old Ironmaker,2017-01-07 17:07:00,8243,I have been going to Bear Creek on and off for well over 30 years summer and winter. Of the dozen or so places we've stayed on Nip it is my favorite.

990523,Chuck Enwinde,2017-01-09 06:07:00,247,You'll have more options and save some $$$ if you can swing a mid week trip.  Most of the good operators will have limited availability on weekends until later in the season (when the fishing tends to slow a bit).  And most waive the full occupancy clause for midweek trips.

990679,jimmer,2017-01-10 20:15:00,2730,"We did Bear Creek Cottages for years and always had great service.  We especially love getting off the ice at the end of the day, real toilets and showers and great facilities for cooking. The reason we stopped going was because we didn't like bringing fish up from over 30' and having to let them go because of the restrictive slot.  Will probably go back at some point, they were by far the best set up for our group over the years."
