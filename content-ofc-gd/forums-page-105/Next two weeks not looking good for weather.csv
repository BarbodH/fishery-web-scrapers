990802,Tjames09,2017-01-12 10:12:00,664,At least not for the Simcoe area.  
990806,craigdritchie,2017-01-12 12:44:00,1586,"Not a good forecast if you like to ice fish, no. But if you like to fish open water, it's a very nice forecast indeed."
990811,AKRISONER,2017-01-12 13:32:00,5558,"Not a good forecast if you like to ice fish, no. But if you like to fish open water, it's a very nice forecast indeed.  for those simcoe open water laker dudes, they are gonna have better weather than I had during the November pickerel run lol  whats insane is the front line that exists.  Chapleau 370miles from st catherines, its 9 in st kitts, its -24 in chapleau....insane take an 8 hour drive and experience a 33 degree temperature variation."
990821,Joeytier,2017-01-12 15:36:00,3990,"If your ice fishing season is dependent on Simcoe freezing, you're gonna have a short season lol.  Lots of snow and ice in zone 11.  Zone 15 probably has even more snow and generally decent ice now."

990848,Weeds,2017-01-12 19:18:00,782,"I like that spring count down clock, but for me, I like to pretend March 1st is the first day of spring."

Zone 15 probably has even more snow and generally decent ice now.   Zone 15 has lots of snow. Not sure about the ice. I could never get to it!  Out east has frozen over well too. Might be my plan of attack this winter."
990872,Tjames09,2017-01-12 22:13:00,664,Well this forecast is basically what anything 1 hour of GTA looks like. If you wanted to go day ice fishing. I checked weather in zone 15 and it'd the same...at least in the Halibut on area. Next week has around 3 and 4 degrees everyday.
990890,Joeytier,2017-01-13 00:32:00,3990,"Yeah, but the ice is already there, and it ain't going anywhere anytime soon."
990899,esoxansteel,2017-01-13 01:04:00,1307,Looks great to me  Chrome Chrome and more Chrome
