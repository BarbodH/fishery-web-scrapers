I have been reading this board for awhile and do enjoy all the posts that i have seen.I don't get out fishing as much as i would like,hence no posts on my behalf. Also not being a boater and tribs in my area not very productive unless the run is on,doesnt help. I do like shore fishing(spinnin&fly) which leads to my question.I am looking for information on a fly in or remote location for big speckies(2lbs+).My Dad,Brother and I would like to do a good week trip and any info would be appreciated. I've already done some searching on this board as well as the net,and have come up with a couple of options.The catch of it is I want to shore fish the rivers not looking for a lake and boat atmoshpere,and stay on budget.Area's of Northern Ontario or Northern Quebec is where I am searching. Cooper's looks great but out of budget, trying to stay under or around the 1000.00 mark. Drop an email if you like. Thanks in advance for any info P.S  A post with pics good or bad would for sure follow the trip!!  Should have mentioned planning for after May and later"
