21143,xrap,2007-01-10 20:39:00,683,"Those are some serious fish man, awsome pics"

21201,Carp,2007-01-11 00:58:00,1488,Good shooting CC.  A hen spawned ot in early January ? The weather must really be screwing up the fishes biological clock.
21219,aniceguy,2007-01-11 01:45:00,1094,"nice pics cc, but and Im not starting something but you now very well what mud does to those fish in the gills.  Give em a dunk and wash at least before the pic set a good example for any new steelheaders bud because mud and improper pics and fish handling kills a lot more then giving up the locations"
21295,canadian_copper,2007-01-11 11:34:00,925,THANKS LOU!! IN SOME SITUATIONS ITS JUST PART OF IT!!! YOU KNOW ME BETTER THEN THAT!!!
21424,Aaron Shirley,2007-01-11 18:13:00,655,"Awesome report CC, and nice pics.  Your report may get me to take my centerpin out of the basement, especially with no ice on the lakes!  Love the report.. keep 'em coming.  Aaron Shirley"
21515,highdrifter,2007-01-11 21:58:00,2534," I second that notion.  Sorry Scott, but that's the muddiest chrome I've ever seen...  I'm not questioning your skills as a steelheader, just your landing technique.  Ever try tailing instead of beaching?  These fish deserve your care and proper handling, just like your centerpin..  Besides, don't they look better clean and unblemished, rather than covered in muck?  cheers  Mcfiddler"
