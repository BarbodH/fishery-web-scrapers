21308,lew,2007-01-11 13:32:00,12767,Looks like some cold weather is actually heading this way and even here in the Banana Belt their talking about -20 for lows and only about -9 for the hi by mid next week.  Guess I'll hafta go see if I can find my winter coat.......haven't needed it yet this year
21310,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-11 13:36:00,0,"I know you're not a fan of the cold weather Lew, but hopefully that makes for some thick icy lakes soon.   By the way who's that funny looking guy standing beside you in your avatar ??"
21312,fishdawg,2007-01-11 13:36:00,912,"  thanks Lew, I needed to hear that!"
21313,Mike Pike,2007-01-11 13:37:00,1332,"Jeez, you'd think it was January or somthin'.  lol  Hey Lew, I know you were stressing about not being able to go out ice fishing this year, so you must be gettin' all your gear ready by the door, eh?"
21314,Greencoachdog,2007-01-11 13:41:00,8163,So does this mean the Banana belt is going to become the Ice cream belt?     BTW... it's s'posed to be in the 70's here this weekend.. might even be warm enough for a nude fishin' trip... stay tuned for the report!!!
21316,Jer,2007-01-11 13:44:00,1426,"Even more importantly, Lew...  North Bay forecast"
21317,pigeonfisher,2007-01-11 13:45:00,696,I don't mind.  Just hope we get some snow as well.
21318,lew,2007-01-11 13:46:00,12767,"  Jim, he was just some poor sap I found hanging around a dock one day begging strangers to take him out in a boat and teach him something about fish'n."
21320,Jer,2007-01-11 13:48:00,1426,...and a nice warming trend for the weekend...to turn the fish on.  14 day trend
21322,bpsbassman,2007-01-11 13:59:00,941," Sorry to hear about your luck Lew!  Try and stay warm.  Only gonna be 73 here today, but should be warming up later in the week.  Refreshing to see you still using F instead of C"
21327,OhioFisherman,2007-01-11 14:20:00,6623,Down here they are called Canadian cold fronts for some reason.
21338,urbanangler1990,2007-01-11 14:36:00,933, lol yup we got ur heat and u get our cold! haha
21339,TAH,2007-01-11 14:36:00,133,14 day forecast sure looks good for ice making and fishing
21340,Raf,2007-01-11 14:41:00,3495," Funny, we call it Cold Alaskan air."
21346,Terry,2007-01-11 14:54:00,14456,"I guess it's time to put away my folding boat, bring out my folding fish hut and find my winter coat......I guess it folds too"
21436,misfish,2007-01-11 18:53:00,29133,"I would say were just kidding ourselves.  This forcast cant support a good ice up.  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/1...es/CAON0040.htm   Terry keep the fold up out my friend,it will do you justice."
21442,nautifish,2007-01-11 19:07:00,1416,  Yup i heard we are in for a big freeze next week but then temps are soppost to warm up yet again. If we do get any ice in our neck of the woods i think it will be very short lived.
21539,xrap,2007-01-11 22:59:00,683,Just finished watching the the weather chanel and looks like winteris coming back. Snow overnight sunday into monday evening and temperature's in the -3 -5 range with wind will feel more like -11 -12. YAY HOPE WE GET A SNOWDAY!!!!!!!!!
21645,Crazyhook,2007-01-12 02:59:00,1154,  looks like a happy fellow!
21646,jason27fish,2007-01-12 03:00:00,90,sweet maybe some fishin will get done this winter
21666,wuchikubo,2007-01-12 03:54:00,1114,It can warm up in T.O. but lets keep the cold up north of newmarket so some of the ice hut people can get some business.
21710,tjsa,2007-01-12 13:14:00,1578,"At present time this morning up here in Thunder Bay, its -20C, and going to be a high of -16C with a wind chill of -27C, then dipping way down to -29C tonight, overnight.  Guess I am gonna have to plug in the block heater on the car this coming week now. But, this is good news, some of our larger bodies of water for laker fishing Feb. 15th to Mar. 15th don't have a lot of ice thickness on them, but this coming week will surely take care of that situation.  Time to test run the power auger, haven't had the need to use it yet."
21713,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-12 13:23:00,0, Try and send some of that down this way Tom.  My wife is getting tired of me setting up the icehut in the garage
