21289,motv8tr,2007-01-11 10:17:00,2587,Who wouldn't want to spend their BD at Lakair among fifty of their closest friends they've never met???  I went up for the day on my Birthday last year.  Definitely worth it.  Maureen
21360,tonyb,2007-01-11 15:21:00,1637,"Exactly, what better way to spend your birthday than in the beautiful outdoors away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  She says, it's just a bunch of old men sitting in boats all day  It's either Lakair or the weigh-in for the Scotty tournament dear, I think you'll have more fun at Lakair.  Tony  P.S. I'm going to get punched in the arm"

21378,Raf,2007-01-11 16:07:00,3495, It's being bumped each time someone votes.  It's an admin option Lew.  Rick or one of the other admins can disable 'bumping' by vote in polls.
