20833,tomO,2007-01-09 22:11:00,363,Anyone been to the lake and fished it?
20955,tomO,2007-01-10 02:49:00,363,No one has any info? I'm interested in it because they have a wheel chair accessable cabin there.
20972,Carp,2007-01-10 03:18:00,1488,"  No worries bud. Just bump this post to the top of the page a few times. Someone who has info is bound to see it.  If you do get to fish this lake, have a great time and don't forget we like pics.  Good luck."
20978,irishfield,2007-01-10 03:33:00,26272,Sorry can't help MB...wish I had a brother like you though!
21168,tomO,2007-01-10 22:52:00,363,Any body? It's around Markstay Ont. close to sudbary I think.
21172,TJQ,2007-01-10 23:11:00,7806,I've fished it in a tourney once... lots and lotsa pike.. but thats what we were fishing for..... its about 1/2 hour from my place..
21174,solopaddler,2007-01-10 23:19:00,8605,"An alternative in the same general area may be Beaverland Camp in Marten River. They've got a wheelchair accessible cabin, and there's decent to good walleye fishing...."
21178,tomO,2007-01-10 23:28:00,363,"Hey T J did you like the lake? Were their many bays and islands? Their page says there's walleye,pike,bass and musky. how bout the depth of the lake oh yea how bout weeds? Solo I'm lookin at that lodge too. Thx"
21184,Handlebarz,2007-01-10 23:54:00,3790,"WE fished tthe Sudbury end alot when I lived there it has some good pickeral spots and alot of pike and bass also, lots of bays all over the place you can find weeds but alot of rock like most lakes up there its a tea color water I love the place you will have fun if that end is as good as the end we fished the lodge should be able to put you in the right direction. We would use rapalas gold/black lightgreen also just troling or use a jig and minnow ya can go wrong you might want to try and get some suckers and rigg  them up for pike. I have not caught any muskie outta there I think they were there years ago but I could be wrong. Hope that helped a bit"
21188,tomO,2007-01-11 00:07:00,363,Yes it does EH thx
21197,Carp,2007-01-11 00:48:00,1488,"See mudbutt, I told ya the responses would come. Sometimes the people you need info from just miss your post. Great place with great people this OFC."
21211,Big Al,2007-01-11 01:20:00,10,Hi Mudbutt I live in Sudbury and have fished Nepewassi a few times. You can access the lake from Markstay or Estair. The pike and walleye fishing is always pretty good and you always have the chance to hook you to a muskey. You can always find a nice spot a get a crap load of perch.  Hope this help
21260,The Urban Fisherman,2007-01-11 03:21:00,2050,"Hey Dude!  I've fished that lake pretty well more than any other.....fantastic walleye (drag a leech around on a worm harness with a slip sinker...try around some islands and just let the wind push you) some great bass opportunities (try to find a weed edge that drops into like 20f FOW and you should find some biggies..... tons of pike, and the only muskie I've ever seen came out of there!  If none of those guys are hungry you can catch pan fish t'il you're sick of taking them off your hook!  Took me 19 years to figure out that lake, now I've gotta figure out Lake ""O""...jeeeeezzzzz  Good Luck!  UF"
21265,tomO,2007-01-11 03:34:00,363,thx so much guys I'll talk to my brother about it. sounds like just the place to take him.
21523,Northhunter,2007-01-11 22:15:00,214,"I have not fished the lake, but it's a stone's throw from the west arm of nipissing. Same fish species, fishing and similiar topography from what I have heard."
