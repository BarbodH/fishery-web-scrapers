21915,MJL,2007-01-13 05:47:00,2427,"Genetics plays a big role in their shape.  I believe the pot belly ones are referred to as ""Simmos"", a strain of carp bred by Mark Simmons - Don't quote me on that one though; google for more info.  Ugly things they are.  Many waters in France are quite prolific and fish have access to large quantities of natural food...Though the high quality fishmeal boilies and pellets they occasionally chuck in there doesn't seem hurt in getting them to their size"
