21465,NBR,2007-01-11 20:06:00,163,"When I get home my wife asks 2 questions, 1) How was the fishing and 2) How was the catching. Answer to 1) Is good 99% of the time, but @ Varies with the day."
20710,Beans,2007-01-09 15:27:00,3339,"Stressed from being ""skunked"" ???...You gotta be kidding !  What else can you do where the only care you have in the whole wide world is whether some dumb old fish is going to pull your string?  And if you don't put no bait on the hook you don't even have to worry about that...  I remember a trip one beautiful fall day on Rice Lake when none of my spots produced...the guy I was fishing with asked ""what do we do now""...I replied ""sit back, relax, and enjoy the day your God has given you to live in""..."
20713,pikehunter,2007-01-09 15:32:00,1659,"Nope, don't bother me at all.  As a wise man once said,""That's why they call it fishin' and not catchin.""  So far at least I haven't thrown a fishing pole into the lake or broken one out of frustrastion"
20727,duber,2007-01-09 16:11:00,220,Getting skunked when I have the  kids  out with me is the only time it bothers me.If we are not catching what we went out for I will find something for the kids to catch.Perch always seem to coperate.
20728,iceguy,2007-01-09 16:28:00,341,"I get stressed when the people I fish with get all sucky and say ""there no point or there no fish in this lake""  or I  target panfish and I get skunked and when  my stuff breaks or doesn't run properly. Skunking with any other species goes with the territory."
20781,OhioFisherman,2007-01-09 19:20:00,6623,"No not really, it was a game that you can`t expect to win all the time and a lot more relaxing than some other games. A little perplexing when you think you have a good game plan and it falls apart, but that is what next time is for."
20849,Nanook,2007-01-09 22:50:00,565,"I started fishing 50yrs ago on Doctors orders,to relieve stress and avoid a ""breakdown"". Did'nt think you actually had to catch fish. Its worked for me ever since.Fishing is the most relaxing thing you can do[except sleep LOL]If ever I feel uptight,working on this retirement, I try to go fishing to relax.  Works for me anyway !!!"
21233,Canoe2fish,2007-01-11 02:28:00,42,"I'm always skunked, I get stressed if I catch a fish.   Seriously, I go out to get away from the hustle & bustle. Fishing is just an activity to keep me busy with outdoor activities. I just love being on/in or near water. If I catch something I feel blessed. If I suck at it, I don't care really. I still got away from the rat race for a while."

20525,highdrifter,2007-01-08 22:48:00,2534,"Calm blue ocean... Calm blue Ocean..  Fishing is supposed to be therapeutic.  Your blood pressure is supposed to drop!  I try not to loose it, but it's stronger than me sometimes.  I think we've all been in that spot at some point in time.  Peter, I do recall a certain outting to OP last year though..  Remember?  I was slaying em that day and you were cursing under your breath..  I know I would have lost it!! I certainly hope that the fish gods have been kinder to you since.  cheers  Diddlhis Kahn"
20530,fishindevil,2007-01-08 22:52:00,6254,"if do get skunked  i always say hey theres always next time,then i think of what i can do next time or to change tactics,so like i always say never give up   sometimes its all about fishing new lakes and trying new lures or just getting away from the rat-race and going out in my boat just chillin out"
20541,Peter Panfish,2007-01-08 23:02:00,46,"I don't really go fishing expecting to catch anything and that method works out for me. I just use fishing as an excuse to hang out with my friends, not work, eat a huge lunch, relax, or a combination of any of those. When I actually end up catching myself a few pike or even the odd waleye I'm pretty much ecstatic."
20547,Rich,2007-01-08 23:13:00,3927,"How can you get stressed when fishin is all about relaxing? Nah, I got used to being skunked long ago."
