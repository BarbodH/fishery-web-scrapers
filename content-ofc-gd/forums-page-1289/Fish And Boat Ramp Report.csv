All the others are open. The only one that I have not heard about is at Point-Anne. Knowing that it is a closed in small bay I would speculate and say that it is probably iced in also. The fishing has been phenomenal all week. The spoon jigs are still the preferred choice for jigging although I have some fellows that are doing just as good on jig heads. I did mention this already this week but I’ll say it again. With the new regs. On the minnows that hit this week has no effect on me as far as supplying minnows and I do have lots on hand. If you need any more info give me a call at (613)969-1035 or email me. Be safe have fun and bring back everything you took with you………….Ron"
