21650,jason27fish,2007-01-12 03:02:00,90,try to use a thick florocarbon as a leader it is not as heaver and when used with a swivel the lures will lose little performance
21669,nautifish,2007-01-12 03:58:00,1416,http://stormlures.com/images/thumbnails/ha...hug_bug_342.jpg   There ya go fishindevil hopefully that link works....lol
21686,snag,2007-01-12 05:15:00,1932,"ALWAYS USE A LEADER FOR ESOX  I can't understand anything otherwise.  I am a fan of all topwater lures and the best way to figure it out is to simply attach various leaders to your lure and drop it in water.  Making your own 80lb. floro leader allows you to play with the length so that you can maximize the lures action. Make sure the hardware (swivel,leader and crimps) are not to heavy as well.  Even if your leader is only 3"" long, it's better than nothing. Don't use small topwater lures either. Go medium to large. Pike eat ducks.  Good luck"
21689,Rich,2007-01-12 05:29:00,3927,"40lb flouro tied direct to your bait, short lead with a micro swivel to connect it to your main line, should keep your topwater baits working fairly well and safe of most pike teeth."
21546,xrap,2007-01-11 23:18:00,683,I have been using topwater lures for pike without any leader. So far I have landed all the fish and haven't got any breaks off's. Until the big one hit and took my favourite lure. Then I tried putting the leader on but the top water bait did not perform the same. It sank half way under water and moved like a log. Now I got power pro so I don't have to worry about leaders and the lure not working the right way. I got another rod with mono on it and I was wondering what would be the best way to to fish for top water pike? I'm taking a trip up north in the summer time and I just want to be prepared for the big boys. ANy tips? Thanks  P.s sorry if this is a stupid question
21554,mason05,2007-01-11 23:39:00,258,I rarely use a leader when fishing for pike.  Even when using sub surface lures.  You win some battles and you lose some I guess.  Corn Nug
21556,xrap,2007-01-11 23:42:00,683,It's not fighting the fish I'm worried about it's when they hit it.
21558,pikeie,2007-01-11 23:46:00,380,"just my .02 cents, but dont count on power pro to work as a leader, pikes teath can still cut through the line no problem."
21562,xrap,2007-01-11 23:54:00,683,better than mono tho
21563,lookinforwalleye,2007-01-11 23:55:00,4399,Try a flourocarbon leader they are strong and nick resistant i know Musky fisherman use them so i don`t see why you couldn`t use it for Pike.
21564,GbayGiant,2007-01-11 23:55:00,1780,I think you should be able to tie a  flourocarbon leader (50-80lbs) to solve your problem without effecting your lure performance.
21569,urbanangler1990,2007-01-12 00:02:00,933,"hmm thats an interesting question actually, would like to see what others have to say, i wouldnt know... but would like to find out also, that fluro stuff, cant pike even easier bite through that?"
21575,xrap,2007-01-12 00:29:00,683,  I dunno   I use the 30lb braid and soemtimes have trouble cutting through it with a knife.
21579,fishindevil,2007-01-12 00:41:00,6254,"hey xrap.have you ever heard of a lure called the   CHUG BUG... its made by storm lures ,get a big 6 inch chug bug and fish with that for top water pike...jerk hard then pause......and repeat they cant resist it,its the best top water bait for pike....hope i helped i dont know if i did the link right but just to www.stormlures.com and look forit on their site most tackle shops will have one      ya....cheershttp://stormlures.com/images/thumbnails/hard_lures/freshwater/rattlin_chug_bug_342.jpg"
21581,Rizzo,2007-01-12 00:51:00,4754,pike teeth will cut through 30lb braid like a hot knife through butter.  When that happens you've lost a lure and possibly killed a real nice fish.  I tie 50 lb fluoro leaders for pike and have not been bit off (yet) BUT I have had to discard some leaders because they are nicked.  Once they have a weak spot those leaders break real easy so you have to keep an eye on them
21582,xrap,2007-01-12 00:53:00,683,"Thanks fishindevil, I'll have to check it out. I'm really success with a the berkley frenzy frog and the pj pop. I heard the pj pop is a bass lure but it has been producing pike for me. I have 4-5 of them but only the red and black one is working well. I'll have to stalk up on some top waters. I got some for christmas that i'm just dying to try out. Thanks for te tips everyone"
21583,huntervasili,2007-01-12 00:54:00,1604,"If i was in your position ... which I often am I would go ahead and buy some good quality fluoro leaders... either lighter musky ones or homemade ones... of course match line weight to fish size in lakes... I seldom have problems with pike breakoffs, its usually the lure that gets the beating and less often the leader... hope this helps some Regards"
21586,urbanangler1990,2007-01-12 01:02:00,933,guys when do yall usually fish top water for pike? in spring?
21588,xrap,2007-01-12 01:05:00,683,"Usally spring threw summer, is the most productive for me. Don't even get to many hits from any fish in the fall using tops."
21589,huntervasili,2007-01-12 01:05:00,1604,I do mostly spring and summer... but the spring is often reserved for trout...
21590,pikeie,2007-01-12 01:05:00,380,"yea i might be tuffer then mono, but i have lost i few pike bass fishin with 30 lbs braid, fishin the slop. cut clean off, like said up above get some 50 lbs florocarbon, very tuff stuff. i use it muskie fisin (100 lbs test) and 50 lbs through 90 lbs for pike and havent been bit off yet."
21591,knotaclue,2007-01-12 01:06:00,136,what kind of knot did you use with the power pro ???
21592,fishindevil,2007-01-12 01:06:00,6254,"yes or early in the summer,mostly in the mornings,like i siad the chug bug drives them crazy...you can use it anytime ive caught pike all during the year using topwater baits.."
21594,xrap,2007-01-12 01:10:00,683," I use the uni knot for everything, never had any break offs really except for a couple times I didn't re-tie after landing a big fish   But talking about mono now. Never had the power pro break off on me. Even when I fish for salmon in bronte for the first time. I used power pro and landed two male nooks. But I use 6lb gama now for salmon, very strong line."
21596,knotaclue,2007-01-12 01:14:00,136,just a thought that a rapala knot might give your lure a little more action on the big braid..just a thought ???
21599,urbanangler1990,2007-01-12 01:18:00,933,"thnx, spring would be best cus they in shallow i guess..."
21600,OhioFisherman,2007-01-12 01:18:00,6623,"Some top water lures aren`t affected as badly by the weight of a steel leader, never tried a floro one so I don`t know how well they will work, lots of people on the board have real good success with them though.  The lures that you normally have a pause in the retrieve have given me the most problems, they hit a lot on the pause, lure is stopped and they get a chance to take it deeper. Continued motion lures like a buzzbait are less of a problem.  There was a product called twist weld wire, a plastic coated wire leader material that was easy to make leaders out of, any length just twist it and heat with a lighter and it fused the coating together, a number of different pound tests so you could match the leader weight to the lure weight pretty easily. The snaps and bearing weight can also throw off the lure action, some seem like they are awful heavy for the pound test of the wire leader they are made with."
21602,xrap,2007-01-12 01:21:00,683,Hmm.. I didn't know certain knots give you diffrent lure actions. I'll have to search the knot up thanks dude
21604,knotaclue,2007-01-12 01:26:00,136,good luck ! it works for me on my fireline and xraps
