22025,Master of Bait,2007-01-13 20:00:00,196,WOW!  Is all I can say.  You are VERY lucky to be able to do that kind of thing.  And GOOD FOR YOU for doing it!
21766,solopaddler,2007-01-12 17:51:00,8605,"Yep, that's the route Moosebunk. Believe it or not (at least IMO) that area isn't what I'd consider truly remote. There is of course the native communities on the Albany, but beyond that pretty much every single lake of substance up there has a fly-in outpost camp on it...The longest I went without seeing another human being on this particular trip was 20 days. On average every second day or so you'd run into someone. The Ogoki WAS awesome, although the Brook Trout fishing, at least for me, wasn't that great. The only thing about Speckled Trout rapids that sticks in my mind was how freakin' hard it was to line up! Bear in mind, on the bigger rivers like the Albany and Ogoki in the middle of the summer the trout really congregate in spring holes. If you're lucky enough to stumble on a spring hole, then it's easy. It's not a simple matter of reading the water and casting to likely spots. I do remember one small falls on the Ogoki however...There were so many walleye packed into the base of the falls (hundreds for sure) that their backs were literally out of the water. They were literally stacked like cordwood on top of each other!"
21771,Guidofisherman,2007-01-12 18:09:00,206,"My hats off to you Solopaddler. That was some canoe trip. The pictures show the power of the water and the beauty of this pristine waterway. I use a small ""point & shoot"" Canon camera in a waterproof case. Great around water. As another post suggests, trips like these with some photos would be worth publishing. My buddy has a small float plane based near Armstrong and several times a summer I get to fly/fish the area. I have flown over a few of the lakes you mentioned and  have only seen the Albany far in the distance. That is one huge area. I keep trying to talk him into flying up there for some of those brookies. I traced your route using my Fugawi map system and am truely impressed with the magnitude of this trip. Can't wait to hear of more. Alan"
21850,Rich Clemens,2007-01-13 01:20:00,3131,That truely is one awsome report and looks like a fantastic trip.  May be a bit to warm for comfort in a couple of those shots.
21930,glirw,2007-01-13 07:04:00,200,"You my friend are a true outdoorsman , and I can only wish I was wearing your shoes . Keep living your dreams and the dreams of thousands of others !"
21943,solopaddler,2007-01-13 12:23:00,8605,"There's something I have to point out...This trip was taken a few years back and the pic's are from the archives. While I've done a few subsequent expeditions since, with my age (42) and a really young family (3 yr. old daughter, 31/2 month old son), it's highly likely that those major trips are behind me now. I'm even (shudder) a cottage owner now.....How can I put this into fishing terms.....I feel like a scuzzy old drop-back drifting slowly back to the lake....my best days are behind me..""that's right, all you feisty young chromers just swim on by me..I'm DONE!"" LOL!"
21996,Carp,2007-01-13 17:33:00,1488,Amazing trip solopaddler.  Those brookies are beautiful.  One of these days.......
22001,setomonkey,2007-01-13 17:46:00,872,"3.5 months, on your own in remote country. Maybe not so remote to you but for a city-dweller like me it's an amazing adventure.  You wouldn't be boring us with more stories if you have time to type them up here, think of it as practice for that book you might write some day!  Mike"
22003,ravinerat,2007-01-13 17:54:00,64,Now that is one great trip. You definatley have more B@#ls than me with the fires. I've done a bunch of Solo trips on Northern rivers but that has to top it. Something elese running the white water solo with no one around for days. My last solo was on the Nagami R near Hornepayne. Still haven't paddled the Missinabi to Moosenee yet even though I had lived so close. I'd like to read some more of your trip reports.  RR
22022,lunkerbasshunter,2007-01-13 19:38:00,2585,very nice trip!!!!!
21425,solopaddler,2007-01-11 18:16:00,8605,"Hey guys, I thought I'd share a few pic's from one of my solo canoe trips. They're scanned and the quality isn't great, but you'll get the idea.  My trip started in the train. Here's a shot of my gear (2 packs and canoe) in the boxcar enroute to Allanwater Bridge.   The next 2 shots are of a forest fire that was raging all around me as I descended the Allanwater River. At one point I came to an impassable rapids which I couldn't run or line and my only option was to quickly portage my gear along the burning portage which was about 800m. I wrapped t-shirts around my face neck and hands, doused my entire body in the river to soak it down, grabbed my first pack and canoe, and RAN! LOL! By the time I made it to the end of the portage, all my clothes were dry, the soles of my boots were starting to melt, and the gelcoat on my boat was beginning to blister! Worst part was I had to run back and get the rest of my gear and do it again.     Next shot is my campsite on Kenoji Lake downstream from the blaze.    The next 3 shots are of the Pallisade River which I ascended. If you look closely in the last pic you can see a native pictograph on the rock just below the rust coloured lichen.      Lunch!    The next couple shots are first, an awesome spot for Brook Trout on the Misehkow River (a large trib of the Albany), and the resulting catch, which were very tasty!     The next 3 are shots of rapids I ran in my canoe on the Albany River.      Some nice spec's from the Albany (also very tasty!)    The next 3 shots are Eskakwa falls on the Albany and another nice spec caught in the frothing whitewater below.      Beach campsite on the Albany.     Lunch again!    More rapids I ran.    An assortment of campsite shots on the Albany and Ogoki Rivers.       Whiteclay Lake    Last 2 are Smoothrock Lake near the end of my trip.     As mentioned the quality of the shots isn't very good, sorry 'bout that. Hope you enjoyed them anyhow, cheers, Mike"

21427,ccmtcanada,2007-01-11 18:20:00,7971,Wow!!! Awesome report!  And here I thought it was a pain in the butt getting my stuff to go on a 30 minute drive to go fishing....LOL.  You trekked thru a forest fire to canoe and go fishing....now THATS dedication!  Looks like you had a great time.  Thanks for sharing your adventure with us...it was a great read.

You take some incredible trips and as I've said before, it'd be great if you could ever take the time to post some of your stories in more detail. I know for a fact that alot of us would definetely enjoy reading about them."

I've got a lot more trip pic's from other expeditions, this particular one was 31/2 months....If I figure out how to improve the quality of my shots I'll likely post more. As far as the stories, I've got lots. One of my close friends has been bugging me to write a book, says he's got the perfect title for it: ""I almost died!"" LOL! (most of my best stories involve a near death experience   ). Cheers"

21517,Northhunter,2007-01-11 22:02:00,214,"Awsome. I like the pics the way they are. Digital has it's place, but there's just something about outdoor shots and film...  I'd like to do something like that someday. I don't know how long I'd last solo though."
21522,Moosebunk,2007-01-11 22:13:00,3970,"Intriguing to say the least.  One day when old and grey and on your last breaths, unlike many you'll feely fully content.  I'm stuck at work but looking forward to going home, throwing in my Fugawi Maps software and trying my darndest to follow your route.  Anytime you want to post adventure like that, please do, but elaborate even more."
21524,Whopper,2007-01-11 22:20:00,2174,"Great report Mike! Neat pics! The pic at Whiteclay is a spot that I know well  , the first time I saw that canyon I almost cried. Here's a pic of me and a buddy by the rock!   Thanks for posting and sharing your experience!  Whopper"

21541,lookinforwalleye,2007-01-11 23:02:00,4399,A marvelous country we are blessed with.
21544,solopaddler,2007-01-11 23:10:00,8605,"Yep Whopper, dat be da same spot! Your pic is much sharper though...I think all I have to do is figure out how to manipulate the settings on my digital (I'm a complete novice) and the old pics will be much sharper. Thank's Moosebunk...as far as my exact route on that particular trip goes: it was down the Allanwater R. to Brennan Lake, then into Granite Lake, then on down the Allanwater R. again into Wababkimi Lake. From Wabikimi, down the Ogoki into Kenoji Lake. From there up the Pallisade system into Burntrock Lake. From there, (this part was nasty!) into Davies Lake, then through another lake downstream to the headwaters of the Misehkow. Down the Misehkow to the Albany, then waaaay down the Albany to it's confluence with the Ogoki River. All the way up the Ogoki to (eventually) Whiteclay Lake, then Whitewater Lake. From there via a series of small lakes to Smoothrock Lake, then into Caribou Lake where my trip ended and I caught the train home. I actually did a more epic trip than that one a couple of years ago.....but that's another story. I could elaborate more, but exactly how much do you guys want to read?!   It would take a lot of writing to get really indepth.  Cheers,  Mike"
21549,highdrifter,2007-01-11 23:26:00,2534,"All I can say is wow!  That last shot is the epitamy of canoing in the back country...  You must have a good command of your canoe to go through those rapids on that Swift!  Thank you.  Keep em coming!  Oh yeah, noice canoe!"
21566,fishindevil,2007-01-11 23:59:00,6254,"WOW..  ...that really looked like an amazing canoe & camping trip   ,and it looked like the fishing was just as great,those scenery shots looked like heaven,thanks for the report and those really tasty looking brookies,....cheers"
