Is it like Pickering, with a warm water outflow?  Is there a launch nearby?  Are there any Lake O. launches in Pickering other than Frenchman's bay marina?  Are there two outflows at Pickering or one?  Sorry for the many questions but I am interested in trying these areas out at some point (maybe the spring).  If anyone's got any info I'd much appreciate the help.  Many thanks!"
22072,fishindevil,2007-01-13 22:43:00,6254,"well,to start there are 2 outflows at pickering and the bigger one is on the east side,you cannot get to them anymore there is no access by foot since the ken thomas murder,they sealed it up ,and on to darlington there is one outflow,and it starts about 200 meters from shore and its only acesable by boat,the only other option for pickering is to launch at duffins creek,right by the lake or on the beach right at the end of brock rd....if you are a shore angler you are not going to either one....cheers"

I used to launch into Frenchman's Bay @ the s/w side and drive the boat out the channel and  over to the east outflow of the nuke station.  I haven't been there in quite a while though.  Past by once about 2 yrs. ago and noticed there was a barrier  preventing people from launching at the old spot I was familiar with.  On calm days, it was possible to launch off the beach on the L. Ontario side, but seems  the access to the beach has also been cut off.  I wonder if the people at the Marina are responsible  for the barriers ? There would definately be financial gain for them if public access was cut off.  A 4x4 vehicle is definately recommended if a beach launch is attempted.  I've pulled a few people out when their tires spun and sank in the sand.  If you are shore fishing, not possible to get near the outflow.  After 911, security around nuke stations, chemical plants, government facilities, etc.,  tightened to the point that many great fishing spots were no longer accessable.  God luck if you do get out there."
