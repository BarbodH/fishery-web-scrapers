21163,xrap,2007-01-10 22:43:00,683,I caught a whole lot of perch in the spring and summer time a while ago now. I got a picture of my two bigger ones but i didn't wiegh them or anything . By the picture can anyone tell how much they would wiegh around.? The one on the right side is 15 inches the one on the left is 13.5.  
21165,huntervasili,2007-01-10 22:44:00,1604,I caught one at 12.5 and he weighed about 1lb ... maybe help you guage the others...
21167,stasbrute,2007-01-10 22:52:00,206,dems is some big donkey perchys......
21171,GbayGiant,2007-01-10 23:06:00,1780,"Not sure what they weight, but big none the less.Nice fish."
21179,fishdawg,2007-01-10 23:29:00,912,"we had a resident fish-weight-guesser here, but he is in his winter hibernation mode right now I believe  nice perch though"
21191,xrap,2007-01-11 00:30:00,683,Maybe i should be a little more specific. Closer to 1lb or 2lbs?
21192,Rizzo,2007-01-11 00:31:00,4754,"yipes, those things look like bass almost!  Big perch, lots not forget xrap is 6'8"" 325lbs"
21194,xrap,2007-01-11 00:39:00,683,"5'11, 160lbs"
21198,fishindevil,2007-01-11 00:51:00,6254,"i would think the largest perch is 3/4 lb,or 1lb,hes sure got a full belly,and the other is at least  1/2 lb  either way they are both tasty good catch....cheers"
21200,Mike the Pike,2007-01-11 00:58:00,3421,Steroids eh!
21223,nautifish,2007-01-11 02:03:00,1416,Well you lot might larf But i allways judge the weight of a fish by how many bags of sugar.....lol  I beleive there are 1kg to every 2 lbs metric.   So a bag of sugar is 2kg if it seems to weigh the equivilent of 1 bag of of sugar then ur fish is roughly around the 4lb mark.  If you cannot judge  the weight of what a half a bag of sugar is  thats not my fault..... lol  I NEVER GOT TO WEIGH THE PIKE I CAUGHT LAST SUNDAY BUT MY ESTIMATED GUESS WAS HE WAS AROUND THE 5 - 6LB Range.
21230,Roy,2007-01-11 02:23:00,13728,"Interesting. So, what does one and an arf bags of sugar look like?"
21235,nautifish,2007-01-11 02:31:00,1416,  Well roy pop over or down to the shop buy two bags of sugar empty half of one bag. Then you will get to see exactly what one & arf bags of sugar look like.   Don't firget to hold em too though okay? Then next time ur out fishing and u wanna guess the weight of ur fish just remember what holding that bag n arf of sugar felt......lol
21236,Fisherman,2007-01-11 02:31:00,7201,How about a sugar daddy
21240,Rich,2007-01-11 02:45:00,3927,"I dont think they'd hit 2 pounds, but they are probably over a pound at least. These two never hit 2lbs..  "
21279,urbanangler1990,2007-01-11 04:02:00,933,"nice ones! ummm ill just toss this out, 1.3lb"
21281,xrap,2007-01-11 04:27:00,683,Wow nice ones Rich!! Sorry for the crappy pic it was in my basement right before we did them. I had the camera with me at the location but the perching was jsut so hot i didn't stop and think to take a pic.
21494,Kirk,2007-01-11 21:07:00,347,I'd guess the left one is about 1.2 pounds and the right one at 1.4 pounds
