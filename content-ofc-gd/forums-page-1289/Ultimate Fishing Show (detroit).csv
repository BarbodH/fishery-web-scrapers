19257,mepps,2007-01-05 14:01:00,1301,"I was there couple of years ago, great selection of boats, but not a lot of good deals on regular fishing equipment. (compared to the toronto sportsmans show)"
19286,Chrispy,2007-01-05 15:15:00,168,"Hey Mepps!  Ya it wasn't too good a couple years ago but it is getting better....  Last year I got some great deals on tackle....2 for one deals on Fireline plus a free hat, flourocarbon at half price, all types of Berkley plastics and Senko's for a buck a package, Rapalas for a couple bucks, Hot N Tots for a buck a piece, etc....My Dad's buddy got the same Okuma spinning reel that I have for half the retail price and they thru in a $50.00 rod for $10.00 bucks more....I think the more people that go to this show the better the deals get.....  I am going to try to make it up to the Toronto show this year....I hear it's a good one!!  Chrispy!"
