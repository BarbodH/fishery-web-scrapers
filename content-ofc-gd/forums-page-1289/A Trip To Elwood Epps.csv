Been quite a while since I have been in there. It has a lot of stuff in there for a small area. The people there were very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I was talking to Mike who works behind the counter in the gun department. He said he is a friend of Spiels. I didnt know this before but he said Spiel is an accomplished rod builder. He also said something about Spiel liking a harbour?-no.... thats not it......O ya now I remember-Lakeport."
21911,irishfield,2007-01-13 05:39:00,26272,Yes Spiel is an accomplished rod builder...    and I don't think the brand matters...LOL
21978,Spiel,2007-01-13 16:20:00,9065,"....Hmmm, Elwood Epps, Mike? Now I'm really curious, where is Elwood Epps and Mike who? As for the Lakeport thing, just a nasty rumour."
21982,Bernie,2007-01-13 16:28:00,3190,Sorry Spiel...Had to do it..   He really did praise your work on the rods..I would like to see your handywork ..I would like to get a customized rod made. I would like to find out all the procedures. Do you start with a blank or can you redo an already made up rod?  Thank you....Bernie
21986,Spiel,2007-01-13 16:38:00,9065,"   ....Either or, I just had my computer reformatted so no pictures on board, but I'll see if I can find some."
21990,Bernie,2007-01-13 17:00:00,3190,Ok Spiel..Thats great.   Not a rush yet..My fav rod right now is a 6.6 one piece Shimano Crucial spinning. I would like to either get this one done up or if you can make up a similar blank. Or you may have a better suggestion. All input will be appreciated.   Thanks again. I will pm you on this in the future.
