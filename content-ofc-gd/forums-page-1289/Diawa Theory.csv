21690,trapshooter,2007-01-12 06:05:00,1234,I have no idea about that model of Diawa but I will share my experience with them.  I bought a capricorn and it didn't last a month.  Keep in mind I guide in the summer and use my gear every day and use it hard.  I'll never buy another spinning reel that's not a shimano.  I beat the heck out of my stradics and they are solid reels.  Just my opinion though....
21732,douG,2007-01-12 15:10:00,2693,All my spinning reels are Daiwas.  I particularly like my Theory.
21736,tonyb,2007-01-12 15:29:00,1637,Team Daiwa advantage reels aren't too shabby.
21751,Puckhead,2007-01-12 16:12:00,377,Never had a problem with mine and I know others that have a whole fleet of them and have had them for years with no issues.  All good and wouldn't hesitate to buy more.
