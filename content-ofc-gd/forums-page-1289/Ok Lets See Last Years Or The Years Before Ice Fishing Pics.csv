20122,dsn,2007-01-08 00:38:00,1018,Well since we are waiting and waiting for the hardwater season let's share the pics of those great ice fishing trips. Here's mine. The first outting I got skunked knew nothing about hardwater. I had used black fire line my first trip out. Had no idea trout were line shy. Switched to mono and the results were this. The second trip of my life was more productive. 9lb lakers.    I went a few times after.. my best outting so these pics might be combo of 2 or three outing lost track.    dsn  Bring it on!!!.
