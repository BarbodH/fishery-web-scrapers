21512,pigeonfisher,2007-01-11 21:53:00,696,you will have to wait on hold.  They are currently processing applications from November 28.  You can also check online.  the phone agents are there from 7:30 - 8:00PM 819-997-8338 push one three times and it will either tell you to hold or that to many (20 people) are holding and nobody else can hold on the line.
21521,irishfield,2007-01-11 22:09:00,26272,"I wish you luck Steve_paul..... but I hope you bought cancellation insurance! GET ON THE PHONE AND DON'T GIVE UP.  Mass panic...last minute applications for the flight into USA deadlines. Apparently even a 4 hours waiting time to submit applications in person at 4900 Yonge Street.  Tickets in hand is >NOT< considered an emergency. Death in family is about it for that to get moved to the front of the pile.  Even last year Leah and I had to cancel our trip to St. Lucia. I was lucky and got the easy quick renewal program they were trying for passports. All I had to do was send a new set of pictures and my old passport to Mississauga. No declarations or anything and I got my passport back in 4 days...on Dec 15th. Leah on the other hand had to send her's with declarations and pictures to Hull. Figured we had lots of time at the time of submission, so didn't bother with the MP's diplomatic pouch route we'd used in previous years. Our trip was to leave January 15th, Her passport showed up around the 23rd..dated the 19th of January...and of course old passport/birth certificate etc...all along with it so nothing to travel with."
21530,lookinforwalleye,2007-01-11 22:43:00,4399,Sorry i can not help anybody that is hung up in the passport jungle but for those who are thinking of getting a passport the best way is to do it at the Post Office i did mine back in October and it took 20 minutes and i had my passport in a week or so it cost a little more but consider the alternative.
21547,Bernie,2007-01-11 23:23:00,3190,2 years ago I needed a passport in a hurry too. Started out with the proper channels-we were going to run out of time. Ended up driving to Ottawa (about a 4 hr drive from here). Went in first thing on a Saturday morning and there were about 20 people ahead of us before it opened. We even got a parking spot in front of the building. Took about an hour. They still had to mail it to me. What an awful process. My business would go under in a week if I operated the way they do. Good luck with your process.
21551,steve_paul,2007-01-11 23:29:00,658,Thanks for the info guys.  Just checked with ex and she sent a copy of the birth certificate with the app and not the original.  As of now you don't need a passport for entry into the Dominican so the birth certificate should do although I would prefer the passport.  Will get on the phone tomorrow morning to track it and see what I can do but still should be able to go.  The application did say they were leaving Jan 20 so hopefully someone notices that and moves them through a little quicker.  What was that someone said earlier about procrastination??  Thanks again everyone for the info.  Steve
21555,irishfield,2007-01-11 23:40:00,26272,"Good luck Steve. Leah's had our 15th departure date on the applications as well...to no positive use.  Lucky that your X has their Birth Certificate originals in hand !! Didn't think you could use a copy of the birth certificate...so you may get the applications delayed/denied anyhow.  Don't forget your signed declarations that your kids can travel with you, but I bet you're well versed in that!  I would also call your airline and be sure about their passport/lack there of requirements as that may/can be different than the destination country... due to ""alternates"" on the flight plan."
21557,Whopper,2007-01-11 23:44:00,2174," Boston I asked the same question about this very subject, the way I understand the new passport deal that Jan 1 2008 crossing the border into the US from Canada or Mexico by auto, boat or train you will be required to have a valid passport. I'm really trying to get my butt in gear to apply.  Whopper"
21560,lookinforwalleye,2007-01-11 23:51:00,4399,it is my understanding that you can not use a photo copy of a  BC for a passport application i believe it says that right on the application.
21615,Nanook,2007-01-12 01:49:00,565,"Just going thro' the process.Got the Forms filled in,getting the Documents signed tomorrow,and in the mail on their way.Had an argument with the Photog. he insisted EVERYONE had to take spectacles off due to to possible glare on the pic..................now...THATS what I call a true likeness.What a load of BULL!!!!  By the way: Why would anyone leave passport application 'til the last minute?"
21617,irishfield,2007-01-12 01:55:00,26272,"Yep Jack ! No Eyeglasses, no ear rings/necklace, no white shirt... so the picture looks nothing like the person they're lookin at."
21685,pigeonfisher,2007-01-12 05:06:00,696, You can use this if your Gaurantor signs the photocopy saying that they have seen the document in person and the photocopy is an exact replica of that document.
21702,Big Cliff,2007-01-12 12:17:00,6899,"Trolling off a cruise ship LOL....... well, I guess you could but it would be easier to troll while ice fishing! Where are you going on your cruise?  I haven't had any problems with passports but I always keep ours up to date and renew as soon as the old ones expire. I did have a hassle trying to get my new health card though. They sent me a notice telling me I had to phone for an appointment, I spent several hours trying to get through on the phone to make an appointment and could never get through. I sent the ministry of health a really nasty email and told them that if someone didn't get back to me within 48 hours to set up an appointment I was going to contact my local MP, MPP, and every media outlet I could think of and raise such a stink about the way they were treating seniors......They called me back very promptly with a time and date for my appointment.  Not sure if this tactic would work with passports though, you might just find that it accidently got cancelled while you were out of the country LOL."
21711,TAH,2007-01-12 13:16:00,133,Hi Big Cliff Hope your are enjoying your stay down south. We are flying into Miami and going to the Eastern Caribbean first time cruisen  TH
21712,steve_paul,2007-01-12 13:19:00,658,"Took 20 mins to at least get in line, now only 17 ahead of me.  At least it is a start trying to find out about the kids application.  Wonder how long it will take to move thru 17 people"
21714,yellowboat,2007-01-12 13:25:00,211," My Passport app got returned for this reason last year even though I had the gaurantor sign, date......"
21723,steve_paul,2007-01-12 14:01:00,658,"Moved thru faster than I thought but of course since I didn't apply for them and my name is not on them as the applicant, they can't give me any info.  Step 2 now, have their mom call."
21800,Tdel,2007-01-12 20:29:00,393,"Oh, and don't forget ................ NO SMILING ..............  That isn't allowed either when you get your Passport photo taken!  Tom"
21942,Big Cliff,2007-01-13 12:14:00,6899,"Enjoy your cruise, we did the Western circuit, quite an experience but not my cup of tea. It was good to try it though. I'll look forward to a report on your return!"
22009,Carp,2007-01-13 18:35:00,1488," Pension ? Heck, I'll probably be long gone before they send me a cent.   Last time I got a passport was 1998, so it's expired now. It only took a few days, but things have changed since then.  I have a simple solution. Vacation in Canada.  We have oceans on our east and west and northern coasts and a gazillion lakes in between. Mountains, prairies, Great Lakes. Urban adventures or country life. Cottages, beaches, resorts, hunting and fishing adventures. Whitewater rafting, horseback camping trips, Large city club scenes and concerts. Fabulous restaurants with foods from around the world. We have native cultures, multicultural areas in many urban communities, OFNCers all over to show you the way. Tons more stuff that I can't think of right now.  Our provinces and territories are so big, they're like their own nation. (However, some won't be satisfied until it's announced by the Prime Minister.  ) You could find different adventures in each one. No need to ever leave Canada.   Good luck with your seemingly lifelong quest."
21303,pigeonfisher,2007-01-11 13:15:00,696,"Man O' Man...I forgot to put my payment information with my passport, now I am trying to get the information to the people and it is VERY HARD to get a hold of someone.  I am by nature a procrastinator...now it (once again) bites me in the donkey"

21321,ccmtcanada,2007-01-11 13:50:00,7971," I've been in your position before for puter tech support (Canon).  I remember putting the phone down, making dinner and eating it before someone picked up.  Another time, I heard the ""click""....got all excited....then another ""click""....moron hung up on me.  Now that you are number 2...hopefully they can give you some good news!"
21325,OhioFisherman,2007-01-11 14:15:00,6623,Passport? are you invading us? LOL hide the wings!
21326,tomO,2007-01-11 14:20:00,363,Do you have to have a passport to cross the border this year?
21329,ccmtcanada,2007-01-11 14:22:00,7971," On January 23rd of this month, anyone flying MUST have a passport...new US regulations.  By 2008 (I think), people crossing the boarder by boat or car must have a passport."
21331,urbanangler1990,2007-01-11 14:30:00,933,"i remember this past summer i was supposed to fly to Serbia, but thnx to my dad lol it got all complicating. On the day of the flight he looked at my passport for the first time, and he has possesion of it, and saw it expired!!! We moved the trip up 1 week, and got a brand new one made in a few days, its a mistake that shouldn't happen but could, so check passports at least 2 weeks before, haha..."

21409,boston,2007-01-11 17:22:00,25," Where is this info coming form in regards to crossing by boat, if I am fishing the Niagara Bar, and hit the US side with my american fishing liscence, will I need my passport on the boat with me, I do have it and it's up to date, would just like to clarify this, any links for this.  boston."
21418,Garyv,2007-01-11 17:39:00,547,I think you will find that the current regulation coming into effect this January is for those traveling by commercial carrier only.  Private trips come into play at a later date.  As far as being in a boat and touching ( landing on ) US shore then you should either have a Nexus or I-68 on your personage.  Without it US border services can impound the boat and you.    That also will be changing to a passport or some yet to be determined piece of identification the same as with car travel later in the program.
21421,ffej,2007-01-11 17:44:00,14,Someone I work with just told me today that she handed in her passport info about two weeks ago.   Normally its a 10 day period to process but she said today she heard on radio that anyone who was submitted the passport application in the last two - three weeks should add 10-15 days to the original estimate they were given.
21422,ccmtcanada,2007-01-11 17:48:00,7971," So, at close to 9am, there were two people ahead of you.  It's now 12:45...PLEASE tell me you are not still on hold....LOL."

I couldn't believe how many letters/phone calls/emails etc... it took to finaly get the card. In total, we ended up waiting 18 months for my daughter's card. HH"
21500,pigeonfisher,2007-01-11 21:18:00,696,"I got through and was not helped very well.  Again, my mistake.  I forgot to include my payment information on the form.  My question simply was can I pay over the phone now so that my passport application doesn't get sent back.  it took her 15 minutes to say NO.  I said...DANG...that is bad.  Ahh Well..."
21505,douG,2007-01-11 21:33:00,2693,Dang indeed.
21509,steve_paul,2007-01-11 21:46:00,658," Any idea where this could be confirmed without waiting on hold for hours with the passport office.  We are leaving for the Dominican next Friday and still are waiting on the passports for the kids.  Wouldn't be too concerned except that my ex did the application and sent their original birth certificates with the application so if they don't come, I don't know what ID we would be able to use.  She applied on Dec 15 so hopefully I can find some sort of confirmation about delays etc."
