22041,Grimace,2007-01-13 20:53:00,2020,"Well, Father and I took off up North Ice fishing.  Lakers  left at 2am Wed Morning.  Get there around 11:30 am   on the Ice by 12:15,   all the tiredness went away as soon as we seen the Ice. Day 1.   Sunshine, -10 , west wind at almost nothing Drilled 6 holes grabbed a minnow threw it on the jig I had on my pole already and shoved it in the hole in 7 feet of water. Dad didnt even have his line in the water yet.  Jig Jig Jig.  Bam, fish on.  dad hadnt even got his line in the water yet and he landed me this nice 4 lb 11 oz laker   a shot of our surroundings   Dads turn and not 5 minutes later   Dad's turn again.  this was the big fish of the week-end at 7 pounds even and 28 inches, he was released along with most of the fish.  we did keep 6 fish in 3 days.   I was a little rusty at landing fish thru the ice and we lost alot at the hole.   The fish were there and we didnt sweat it.  Hey Look a nice little Whitie   a little laker.   boy what a day   Another little laker   went back bbq some food.  -27 that night   Day 2.   Warm at -5, south wind at 15 km/h.   fish still biting, we are about to have another great day.  Fish on.   the old man strikes again   Action shot of dad and his home made jiggin rod in action    boy these fish fight. another modest little laker with alot of heart   a picture of some scenery and my thumb   a nice 6 pounder for me.    Day 3  we only have an hour and a bit to fish.   better get moving dad gets a little whitie  I got this one, and dad got another one that the pic didnt turn out.  not bad for a quick hour before we leave    Had an absolute blast, all fish were caught in 7-11 feet of water, 3 different days 3 different temps, wind directions and conditions and the fish still co-operated.  cheers every one"

22087,canadian_copper,2007-01-13 23:20:00,925,SWEET FISH!!! NICE TO SEE SNOW!!
22090,camillj,2007-01-13 23:22:00,1988,  I was thinking exactly the same thing ... I can see catching them up top ... but over much deeper water ... wow thats more like Speck depth ! Come t think of it the colors on those lakers is something special.   Thanks !!! great report .... with this colder weather and all those beauty pictures you got me wanting to travel north NOW  ( had everything packed up to head north of haliburton today and chickened out for fear I might not find any ice ... so I spent the day at LeB and CT .... stocking up
22091,huntervasili,2007-01-13 23:23:00,1604,Glad to see the weather and more importantly the fish cooperated on your excursion... Great report-Thanks for sharing
22095,Grimace,2007-01-13 23:34:00,2020,thanks guys.   they are lakers.  no splake in that system.  great colours
22100,urbanangler1990,2007-01-13 23:41:00,933,"awsome report and fish, btw i would love to try to go for those specks and brooks, where do u guys think r good? Ive never got at these fish b4..."
22104,Carp,2007-01-13 23:50:00,1488,"Very nice report and great pics. Those lakers are beautiful. I thought they were a mix like splake at first.  7 to 11 feet of water ? WOW !!! Seems very shallow for lakers. As mentioned, it wouldn't be so unusual to be getting fish 10 ft. down in deeper water.  Great trip."
22117,pikehunter,2007-01-14 00:04:00,1659,"Nice catch guys!  Just one question...all that white stuff all over the place, what the heck is it????  I haven't seen anything like it in soooo long!"
22119,tjsa,2007-01-14 00:11:00,1578," I know what that white stuff is, and unfortunately, it has made itself self-evident in the last two days up here. Had to remove it from the steps of my house the last two days, in -20 and less temps"
