21737,pameladallaire,2007-01-12 15:30:00,470,I was looking for on-line art courses for our art club.  This site actually has art shows and Fishing shows.    This is the trial page.  Fishing TV (I fixed the link)  Pam
21740,tonyb,2007-01-12 15:43:00,1637,Hmm the link doesn't work for me.  I doubt many people would pay for a fishing show online when there are freebies.  Tony
21760,Mike Pike,2007-01-12 17:20:00,1332,Hmmmm... doesn't seem to work for me either.  Audio is good but the video is way off.  Wonder if they're doing it on purpose so as not to give away any of their programming free but just let people kinda see what they're about.
