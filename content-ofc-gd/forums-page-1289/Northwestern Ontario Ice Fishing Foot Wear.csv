21642,Rich,2007-01-12 02:47:00,3927,"Yep, after you lose your feet to frostbite they give you a nice new shiny pair of wooden ones!"
21643,GbayGiant,2007-01-12 02:51:00,1780,"I seen a few hippies that still walk around town barefooted, but on the ice."
21745,duber,2007-01-12 15:50:00,220,Wish we had ice to freeze or feet on!
21750,huntervasili,2007-01-12 16:05:00,1604,guess you loose all feeling in the feet after a couple hrs on the Ice eh?
21788,walleyejigger,2007-01-12 19:41:00,876,"i've done that, in just boxers, sleepin in the hut we used to leave one line out not far from the hut with a bell on it, went out in my skivees a few times, you don't feel the cold until after you bring up the fish"
21860,mason05,2007-01-13 02:20:00,258,Nice trout!  I'd take a nip on the toes from jack frost to reel in that little fella.  I'm sure the propane heated hut wasn't too far away.  Congrats dude.  Corn Nug
