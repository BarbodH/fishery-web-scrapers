18488,pameladallaire,2007-01-03 02:36:00,470,"Everyone with cameras please point them at any owls you see.  I'm going to be doing paintings for The Owl Foundation  in Ontario.  It is the rescue and release center for Ontario owls.  It also breeds the native species of owls and trains them to be self-sufficient, and then flys them to their normal breeding areas around ontaro.  I think a great cause.  So lots of pictures would be useful for me.  Full body shots or close up head shots. Thanks in advance.  Pam"

18531,bpsbassman,2007-01-03 03:56:00,941,"Very cool Pam. If you ever fish down by the railroad bridge at the back of Jordan Harbour, you can see the owl cages on the Owl Lady's (Kate McKiver's) property.  I've always kept my distance and observed through binoculars 'cause I know she doesn't want any human interfence.  They have had a few TV specials on her in the past."
18535,danc,2007-01-03 04:12:00,4677,"I consider myself lucky if I see a wild Owl every 5 years or so. I'm not sure if you're interested in captive Owls Pam, but if you are, here's one from our local zoo that I took last summer. Complete with a chain link fence frame. There's some nice detail in the shot. Ron will supply you with what you need I'm sure.  "

18995,JustinHoffman,2007-01-04 15:35:00,482,"Hey Pam,  Weather permitting, I'm heading to Amherst Island (Millhaven area) to do some photography. Last week they had a few snowy owls on the island, as well as 25+ long eareds in the Owl Woods! I'll see what I can do..  Good Fishing, Justin"
18998,pameladallaire,2007-01-04 15:44:00,470,"OOOOOH, nice ones guys.  I can't wait to see more.  Pam"

19517,Tacklebuster,2007-01-06 01:35:00,303,"Great pics Ron, you have a really sharp eye for owls.  I really enjoyed your slide show, thanks for sharing."
19530,pameladallaire,2007-01-06 02:07:00,470,"Awh, your sweet Ron.  You know you will get a few free prints.  Thanks for all your work.  You are a great photographer.  Any any of the paintings for the Owl Foundation will be up for sale after they are finished.  Pam"
21769,dsn,2007-01-12 18:01:00,1018,ok heres my submittions. Kinda Grainy but then again I'm still trying to figure out this digital. I had to use ISO 400 cause it was just too dark and the flash would have ruin the pic and caused a white out.                 3 more to be added.  dsn
21802,pameladallaire,2007-01-12 20:54:00,470,"Thanks so much DSN!!  Go ahead and add the rest, I'm curious.   I see you took them at the zoo, thanks again.  I love owls and have an excuse to paint a lot of them, all varieties.  Pam"
21816,dsn,2007-01-12 22:28:00,1018,ok here's the other three. This guy seems to hate his picture taking. I noticed that with the monkeys too when I was at the zoo. I go straight up to the glass and just as I get ready to snap the shot they quickly turn away.  . So I go over to the other side where they are facing and get ready to snap the shot. They turn back to the other side where I started from.   So I try again at the side I started from again. Finally got the image focused and just as the finger goes down to take the shot... guest what happends?   Yep they turn to the other side again. So in order for me to take these shots I had to run from one side and fake the shot and quickly run back to the other side and snap the pic quickly.   Are they photo shy or they hate their pictures taken? But they sure know what seems to take place when some sticks something up to the glass.        I had to do some exercise for you Pam.They made me sweat for them  dsn
21820,JustinHoffman,2007-01-12 22:45:00,482,"Thought I'd put my post in here, so all the owl post/images are together.. Justin    Hello All,  Made the trek over to Amherst Island (just west of Kingston at the town of Millhaven) with the folks to do some owl and raptor watching. Spotted 9 red-tail hawks on the drive down the 401, so spirits were high. Jumped on the ferry at 9:30am for the 15 minute crossing over to the island. Started driving the north-east loop of the island, spotting numerous hawks along the way. Made our way down to the southern shore, when my mother pointed out a bird that was flying to the left of our car right along the shore. Before I could make visual contact, she stated it was only a seagull. I finally spotted it 5o feet ahead of us, and knew by the size and shape that we had our first snowy owl sighting for the day! To make things even more exciting, it landed on a fence post a mere 200 feet away!! Got the camera ready with my 300mm telephoto, and began shooting out the side window. Every so often, I would creep the car forward, eventually getting less than 20 feet from it!  Here's some closeups of this female snowy..        At this point, a car had pulled up a distance behind, and was waiting patiently to pass. We decided to drive right past the owl, and park further down on the shoulder. The other fella got out of his car and starting taking shots, and we did the same.    At this point, I had the camera trained on the owl and was just about to press the shutter button, when the girl got spooked and flew up. The amazing thing is that the owl flew directly at me! I really love this next shot - not 100% in focus, but not bad to say I wasn't ready for a motion shot..    After this bird flew off, we spotted a male hunkered down in the brush a mere 100 yards from this girl. The one was pure white, but was too far away for a decent shot.  We decided to stop for lunch at this point, then hike in to Owl Woods. This is a neat area of trees that houses quite a few species of owls, although the most common is the Long Eared. After a lengthy hike, we make our way into the woods.  Within 30 seconds, I'm greeted by this fella..    We saw 25+ of these Long Eared in the woods! At one point, I witnessed four of the birds perched on one branch together...It's tough to get a decent shot in here, because there is so many twigs and branches on the trees. Also, the sky was pretty washed out and it was fairly dark under the canopy. Nonetheless, a couple turned out ok..    Headed back into the car, and began the western loop. Many, many raptors, including red-tailed, Merlin, Kestral, Northern Harrier etc... Conservative figures would put the raptor count at around 30+  So, a pleasant four hours spent on Amherst. Grabbed the 3pm ferry back to the mainland, and back to civilization..  Good Fishing, Justin"
21826,dsn,2007-01-12 23:01:00,1018,Gotta love the pic with the Owl in flight. Great shot Justin!!   dsn
21830,pameladallaire,2007-01-12 23:20:00,470,"Thanks to everyone!  Remember, anytime someone has good shots they can e-mail me directly, or just post them here.  I'll see them.  Pam"
21832,JustinHoffman,2007-01-12 23:25:00,482,"Hey Pam,  Going to try to get back to Amherst in the next week or so - hopefully I can get some more shots. (Saying that, the chances of me being lucky enough to get a snowy in flight again might be stretching it, but we'll see!) lol  Justin"
21837,danc,2007-01-12 23:46:00,4677,I'd just like to add my congrats to Justin for the fantastic photos. They don't get much better than that.
21842,JustinHoffman,2007-01-13 00:01:00,482,"Thanks so much, Dan...that means a lot. Your shots are always stunning too, my friend..  Good Fishing, Justin"
21872,pameladallaire,2007-01-13 03:54:00,470,"They don't have to be snowy's Justin. Any will do, I'm sure I'll use that flying shot and blur the wings to create movement.  I have lots and lots to choose from, I'm a happy camper.  (now I just have to get my energy back after surviving the flu.  ) Pam"
