21663,RobHall,2007-01-12 03:45:00,261,"Was browsing Youtube and came across this video.    I replayed it several times and think it's a musky, not a Pike.  It was a very quick strike, but i think you see it long enough to tell it's a Musky.  Any comments?  Am i seeing things?  fishinonthebrain  "
21664,nautifish,2007-01-12 03:50:00,1416,I just watched it several times myself and i think i would have to agree It does look like a muskie.  But again its not a great video as in picture clear.

21668,xrap,2007-01-12 03:58:00,683,I'd have to go with the pike. Certainly a big one tho.
21670,Photoz,2007-01-12 03:58:00,792,Perhaps it should be forwarded over to Peter on Cook Bay . . . . .     he's the local pikeskie expert?

21672,RobHall,2007-01-12 03:59:00,261, I was thinking the same thing.  You can briefly see the markings.  Good eye FishFinder.   fishingonthebrain

21675,RobHall,2007-01-12 04:12:00,261,"So technically speaking the guy who posted this video is half right, as a tiger musky is Pike/Musky mix.  Something that I just recently learned, was the fact that this hybrid breed is sterile.  fishingonthebrain  "
21681,Cookslav,2007-01-12 04:34:00,1457,Rock bass...and a big one too!
21803,pikeie,2007-01-12 21:07:00,380,"i think that it might be a pike. because if u let the video play and u pause it at the right time, you can see that the tail looks round like a pike not pointed like a muskie. but then agian it could be a tiger muskie because they have rounded tails too, if im not mistaken"
