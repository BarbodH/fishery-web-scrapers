381436,scuro2,2009-09-09 21:33:00,904,What a nice story. Nicely done.
381638,ehg,2009-09-10 02:02:00,2666,That's a great thing to do for your father
387116,irishfield,2009-09-25 23:35:00,26272,"I missed this while away Joey... but I think it's a great time to bring it back to ""life""!  So close to home for me it's just unreal and I know the smiles from the fishing trip will help you along the path of life now and in the future."
380712,Joey,2009-09-08 02:32:00,9122,"Dad has stage 4 lung cancer right now, which has spread to his liver and kidney.  My sister and I took him out for his birthday for lunch a few weeks ago and he said to me he really wanted to go fishing.  He's pretty weak right now, and very thin compared to what he used to be, but we sat a date for this weekend and he was as excited as a kid on Christmas Eve  I was half expecting him to cancel, but he didn't and was a real trooper for the day.  He loves to fish for bass so since he lives in Aurora and we were not sure how long he'd make it, we just headed to Keswick to try for some smallies near Crates Marine.  Here we are heading down the river to the lake.    Here is his ""tackle box""     A scotch tin    He didn't have much for tackle so I rigged him up with a spinner bait and he did his best trying to stand and cast.    That didn't last long and he decided he wanted to just use his Mepps with a worm and bobber.   I think his Mepps was 50 years old.  He got the first fish     Not big, but a fish nevertheless.      Not much action in the area so we headed up to Snake Island.  There was so much boat traffic it was insane.  The waves that were produced by all the traffic was pretty bad and he had a hard time standing.  He ended up having a little lie down for about a half and hour so we decided to take him down to the very south end of Cook's Bay where there is not much traffic.  He got another little perch and I got a pike.      He still beat us both in the fish dep't as he got two fish  But mostly, he was just happy to be out with us.  He really didn't want to leave even tho it was now 4:30 and we had been out since about 9 a.m.  I couldn't believe he had made it that long, but was looking pretty tired.  So we packed it up and headed back to his place.  He said he was going for a nap  All day he just kept saying how happy he was.  We shared some sandwiches, fruit, stories and jokes.  It was a really good day.  I will definately be taking him again soon.  He wants to try for some Salmon now   Thanks for letting me share this special day with you, and if you can, take your dad fishing!!!  Joey  p.s.  Thanks for the fishing tips Cudz!!  Much appreciated."
