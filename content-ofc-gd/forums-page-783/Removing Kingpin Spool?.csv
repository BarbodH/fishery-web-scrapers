I didn't try to pull too hard to avoid damaging it, but I was curious if anyone else has had this issue or if I am doing something wrong.  The reel is the newer 4 7/8"" model that came with the allen key screw so the bolt can't loosen itself from the backplat thread.  Any tips would be appreciated.  Thanks"
