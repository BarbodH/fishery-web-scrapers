386500,Stern Rules,2009-09-24 06:16:00,342,Forgot to mention I was out in Waterford a couple weeks ago and the CO nailed a few people for using more that one rod at a time. The guy next to me said he wanted to nail them 'cuz they were using multiple rods. He went from one side of the street to the other and was a good hour dealing with them all. Once he was done with them he left. He didn't even come up to us. Too bad though 'cuz I was gonna ask what fine he gave 'em. I don't think he confiscated their equipment but I'm not sure on that one. We were a bit up the road. Good to see they do get out there. That's the first time I've seen 'em.

386522,scugpg,2009-09-24 12:25:00,1373, That's not enough if you ask me....some people may take that risk at that price unfortunately
386705,CRAPPIE,2009-09-25 00:10:00,213,What are they catching?
386731,BillM,2009-09-25 00:48:00,17367,I wish there was a CO out at the GBay trib I fished tonight..  Who the hell fishes in a 4ft deep pool with a monster five of diamonds?  Brutal snagfest..
386732,irishfield,2009-09-25 00:51:00,26272,But trout like them big Len Thompson spoons... it's my go to lure ! (downrigging!)
386761,Dara,2009-09-25 02:13:00,3052,  So you troll with a downrigger in 4' of water?  How far back from the ball do you run it?   sorry...but that made me laugh
386795,BillM,2009-09-25 03:42:00,17367,"  Wayne, I'm sure the trout love it!!!  These chinnies weren't to fond of it."
386796,irishfield,2009-09-25 03:43:00,26272,You mean there's still salmon left out there??
386808,BillM,2009-09-25 04:14:00,17367, I saw a tonne of fish this evening... I guess there were sick and tired of waiting for the rain and decided to come up river anyhow.
