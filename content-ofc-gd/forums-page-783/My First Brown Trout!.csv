386858,The Urban Fisherman,2009-09-25 13:00:00,2050,"Quick report folks... after work yesterday a buddy and I decided to fish for 45 minutes or so before he had to make the long drive back to his house. (he lives 3 hours away)  So off we went for a quick session.  He picks up a an X-Rap (Mercer's Magic to be exact) and starts throwing it for big fall Bass - had a couple of solid followers, but the mid-sized fish were aggressive and kept flying in and scooping up the bait first....    I pick myself up a micro rapala crank bait, and say "" I'm just going to throw this because I've never caught a brown trout before, in-fact, I've never even seen a brown trout caught in this lake before.""  So I wind up, let her rip, and a few seconds into my retrieve on my FIRST CAST a nice shadow comes flying out after it, smashes my bait, goes airborn - and wouldn't you freakin know it, it's a nice little brown!    My buddy lost it laughing, then I told him to smarten up and help me land my prized fish!        Then my buddy decides to prove that browns like the Magic also! ( so much for not seeing them in that lake before )  I kind of missed the boat on his fish's picture... it's the brownish blob you see swimming off...    That was enough for us!  Not a bad 45 minutes on the water!  My first ever brown, and obviously my PB.  Have a good friday - and enjoy your weekends!  Cheers, Ryan"

387154,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-09-26 01:11:00,1107,Nice one your 1 up on me now still haven't landed 1 yet outta there. Going next weekend to chase some big lake erie browns if it stays cool after the rains were supposed to get.
387222,dave524,2009-09-26 11:31:00,4508,"Very nice fish. When I was younger, back in 74/75, I worked seasonally at Long Point Prov. Park and the Waterfowl Management Unit , lived in Port Rowan and got into some there and a few creeks very near to that spot. Now that I've just retired maybe a trip back there should go on my to do list. Getting a nice brown like that always was a thrill after the more usual fare of put and take Bows and the occasional Speck."
387223,Spiel,2009-09-26 11:43:00,9065,"Great pictures of a great fish, absolutely beautiful!"
