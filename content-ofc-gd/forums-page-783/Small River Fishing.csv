Total Hours Fishing: 3  Total Fish Landed: 4  Largest Fish: 10"" Rainbow       I aslo caught another tiny rainbow, tiny brown and what I think was an atlantic salmon smolt.  This little guy was doing his best to avoid me.    Just before calling it a day I saw a Brown Trout that must have been 14""-18"" stuggling to swim in a large pool. I watched for 5 minutes as it swam in circles. I was able to walk right up to it, touched it's tail and it slowly swam away. Not sure exactly what was wrong. Didn't see any noticable fungus or hooks in it's mouth.  Hope you enjoyed. Now I'm off to fish the large river again before work."
