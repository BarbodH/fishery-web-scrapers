The odds of Actually getting a true form of H1N1 in its self is rare, and the odds of serious complications are even more rare...so together the odds of contracting a ""serious"" case of H1N1 is in fact reeeeeely rare.  So although side effects from the shot are also ""reeeeeeeeely rare""....it'd say the need for the shot is up for debate.  Especialy considering there are no long term studies to conclude its validity, or saftey. No assurance the vaccine is effective in the short term or in the long term vs mutated strains, no assurance the vaccine is safe or effective if you had the seasonal flu shot this year, or last. No assurance that is won't adversly effect you from other flu strains next year(like last years shot has come around to bite us this year)  I don't think any of this is a no brainer?  Bottom line is there is not enough testing done to ensure its effective, safe, or worth it for people not in a high risk group."

384055,Cookslav,2009-09-17 01:04:00,1457,"If its anything like the standard flu shot its effectiveness is still questioned by Many medical proffesionals... The simple reason is not the effectivness of the Vaccine against the targeted strain but rather which strain it protects against vs the actual strains going around. Generally speaking, By the time they manufacture and distribute the vaccine there are usualy already several mutations and strains floating in differnt areas across the province that are not covered in the Vaccine. In the Pharmacutical world Its admittidly a bit of a guessing game determining which strains will hit, and what mutations will follow in the provinces many different regions.  The moral of the story... If your in a high risk group, or have people close to you that may be in the high risk group you could spread it too... why not limit the odds and get the shot. But if your like me who is not in that goup, nor do I beleive anyone I am generaly in contact with is in that group there is about as good a chance that I'll suffer a side effect as there is I'll contract the given strain its designed to protect.  Some might disagree but My mother in law is a nurse, who used to get the shots...who no longer does as it has yet to protect her. She gets some version of the flu every year....I'm sure its not the strain the vaccine was there to protect her from, but none the less she got it. That very same mantality was echoed by my Family Dr. When I asked about it he said the Jury is still out on the vaccines, and being a young healthy man not in a risk group it was unwarranted.  I'll have to ask him about the H1N1 But I'm guessing being the H1N1 vaccine is still out for the jury to decide, and it is after all a flu that is KNOWN to mutate...quicky...and often I'll more then likely be in the same boat and avoid the shot while I exersise common sense with regards to washing hands etc.  The bottom line... This is the internet folks, If you're unsure ask your Doctor and get some first hand educated advice to ponder.  No harm in that."

I am just more scarred of the vacination that than the flu itself.  When my father was sick in the hosptial with West Nile Virus, before they knew what he had for sure, they thought he had an auto-immune disorder called Gillean-Bare Syndrome (not sure of exact spelling).  Doing some research on it, I found the effects on the nervous system were devasting, and one of the possible (although very, very rare) causes was an adverse reaction to the flu shot.  I am by no means a medical expert so I have no idea how accurate what I read was.  What I do know is this.  I do not spend a lot of time around children or in schools or medical facilities, so my risk of exposure is on the low side and  am reasonably healthy most flu seasons.  Finally, I recall a few years ago there were a bunch of paremedics (I think in the GTA) that refused to get the flu shot due to unknown, long term, side effect studies.

The current Vaccine(that is already argueably outdated) may infact already be out dated and not effective against that strain as is.

Just cause you got the shot does not mean you won't get it, or a similar strain, and yet we don't know the long term effects of the vaccine.

Now, for the naysayers, use your heads and stop looking up crap on conspiracy theory websites. The pharmaceutical companies make far more money off the people who DON'T get vaccinated. If you think that saving lives is not worth a needle...shake your head again. Influenza is also extremely expensive to treat especially when secondary infections like pneumonia take hold. You cannot get sick from a vaccination unless you are allergic to eggs. There is nothing in the shot to make you sick. We wiped out polio in this country with vaccinations. They work. The cold does not kill millions of people. Influenza and other flu type viruses mutate (or evolve) every year with different strains coming about. If you want to risk the lives of the young, old and susceptible in your family, that's up to you. But using hyperbole and nonsensical rhetoric does not make your point even remotely valid."

I tend to rely on people who are educated in the field as opposed to those who first approach a scientific concern with a political opinion and conspiracy theory. My wife for instance, who has been a health care worker for 20 years in the ICU and infectious disease and has trained for first response duty and protocol many times to handle large scale disaster/pandemics, including HiN1 should it mutate into a more aggressive virus. According to her and the overwhelmingly vast majority of her colleagues H1N1 is real and you are foolish to not get a vaccine.  There are always large groups of people who oppose any time of government proposed mass inoculations. There are still many active groups who feel their children should not have to take any vaccinations at all including those that prevent polio and diphtheria. It is astoundingly foolish thinking."

383765,Chris,2009-09-16 11:43:00,405,"No needles for this guy. The one and only year my wife, daughter and I did get the flu vac was the worst year for flu sickness we have ever had. That same year I had the worst flu (lasted for over a week) that I have ever had in my life. Haven't had the flu vac since then and haven't had the flu since then. According to some, myself and others of my ilk are not very intelligent. I wasn't going to comment on anybody's intelligence level, but since that can of worms has been opened I'll just say that I wouldn't trust anybody associated with anyone in government. But apparently there are lots of suckers who do.  In regards to passing it on to the young and old.....my daughter is more likely to bring home a flu bug than me or my wife (I work out of my home office and my wife is a stay-at-home mom).  Have a nice day, hope nobody gets H1N1."
383782,jughead,2009-09-16 12:49:00,92," That's part of the issue though. My wife and children all take the flu shot. I never have and don't plan on it. For whatever reason, seasonal flu's don't hit me very hard and never have. My son and one of my daughters are the same. My wife and my other daughter get floored by some of the flu bugs so for them it is a smart choice. The flu shot relies a good deal on guess work trying to predict the strain of flu that will be most active and impacting for a given flu season. There is no guarantee they get it right so despite getting a flu shot there is still a chance you will get a bad flu. The H1N1 vaccine is focused on a specific strain that they have isolated. The H1N1 flu is different more so if it continues to mutate. They are two different discussions but too often are lumped together."

Also the whole concept of Vaccine was to help with Massive pandemics that were killing millions, so if you save a million and kill 100,000 from the vaccine, thats good I think.  However if you kill 100,000 and save none,...thats bad I think.  We all know what a Vaccine is,..a 'dead' strain of the same virus that kills you.  Problem there is with mutation and entoro/retro viruses that evolve faster than we can keep up and can survive conditions we fail to understand.  No Offence to our buds on the south side,..but we up here think a little more for ourselves, than what Big Bad Daddy Sam tells us to do.  Oh say can you seee....Lol  Seriously No offence, I think its a culture thing.  Just wash your hands and sneeze on your sleeve and dont nuzzle others sleeves,..lol   Needles are for giving Blood, when your sick and smack...Lol"
383610,rylan,2009-09-16 00:21:00,134,"Bob, you are so right and thank you for sharing that information. Everyone needs to research everything before they put anything in there bodies.  Whatever happened to the OLD eat healthy, get some exercise  -- wash your hands. and PLEASE everyone needs to remember that there are companies out there right now foaming at the mouth with all the PROFITS they think they are going to make over this...   And crap -- they have not even tested the vaccine.  Wake UP PEOPLE"
383611,Ziki,2009-09-16 00:23:00,128,"Yup, don't see why our friend from the south thinks it has anything to do with the needle, or wanting to get sick (I almost find that insulting). I give blood on a regular basis and have also never had a flu shot."

Problem there is with mutation and entoro/retro viruses that evolve faster than we can keep up and can survive conditions we fail to understand.   Dude--- look at a company called BAXTER- it is run by Don Rumsfled. You know the guy that was on National TV on Sept 10/01 saying that there was 2.3 TRILLION dollars missing from the Pentagons budget, then the very next day a plane smashes into the Accounting department of the ""pentagon"" -----uuummmmm  There are two types of vaccines-- those with and those without the live strain- this is of course so they can infect more thereby making more MONEY and then they can say -- ""you see its justified""   And if you look hard enough you will even find that BAYER- actually sold the LIVE virus of --- wait for it----AIDS... thats right they sold the live strain to 3rd world countries so they did not have to throw it out-- they made money off of that.  Boy and girls-- we live in a time where money and profit RULES, and the psycho paths of today do not care about you or your family --they care about $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"

383617,Greencoachdog,2009-09-16 00:38:00,8163,"Go ahead and make up the excuses!!!... a bigger bunch of chicken squats I've never seen!!!  I give blood, I give blood... but I'm terrified of an injection!!!   .. many years from now, you will grow older and wiser... and you will realize I speak the truth!!!  ... until then, you can hide behind you extremely lame excuses for not getting the injection!   ... maybe it has something to do with Canadas health care system???"
383618,bigfish1965,2009-09-16 00:41:00,3382,"Getting my flu shots like every year. My mother is on meds for rheumatoid arthritis which purposely suppress her immune system. I don't care if I get it, but I don't want to risk giving it to her."
383620,douG,2009-09-16 00:42:00,2693,"I think the real problem is lack of critical thinking skills.  The idea that multinational pharmaceutical companies intentionally infect the world populace to create a market for their products is A GREAT IDEA!!!1!!1  ZOMG!!1!!!!!  Another example: If I remember correctly, the last time swine flu reared it's ugly head, (1976?) the vaccine killed way more people than the bug did.  If you want anyone to believe anything you say, back that  up.  Cite proof, or stop it.  That's crap, and has no place here."
383626,Harrison,2009-09-16 00:55:00,2202,"Same here Rick, though it is my lil girls.  I take the Go Train to work, the less I can bring home, the better."
383632,Greencoachdog,2009-09-16 01:01:00,8163,"  That's one of the main things Rick ""O""... if I get it, who am I going to give it to???... loved ones/family?... friends?... coworkers?  ... maybe someone here has children that go to daycare or work in a daycare center, how would they feel if they gave it to their child and then it was spread amongst the other children in the daycare center?... or even worse, a daycare center worker exposing the children they are supposed to be taking care of to the disease!!!   Think about it!!!"
383633,bigfish1965,2009-09-16 01:02:00,3382," I work in a casino...the meeting place of all viruses...lol I have a very strong immune system, but that would not stop me from carrying the virus to someone else, like my mother, who does not. So maybe y'all might want to think about your kids or parents or grandparents and wonder if they can survive influenza. It kills tens of thousands of people in North America every year."

383657,jaydub,2009-09-16 01:27:00,145," Ignorance From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Ignorance is the state in which one lacks knowledge, is unaware of something or chooses to subjectively ignore information. This should not be confused with being unintelligent, as one's level of intelligence and level of education or general awareness are not the same. The word ""Ignorant"" is an adjective describing a person in the state of being unaware.  I'm not claiming to be an expert on this subject as I'm definitely NOT.  What I do know is several people that choose to study up on this subject unbiasly (if that's a word) and all tend to come to the same conclusion that Monsterman seems to have come to.  It's ALL about the almighty $$$$$$ folks."
383659,Fishnwire,2009-09-16 01:32:00,983,  Wow.  holdfast can relate this thread to an experience he had in the military.  What are the chances?
383664,Greencoachdog,2009-09-16 01:47:00,8163," Your definition hit the nail on the head!!!   ... but as far as the almighty $$$ goes, isn't health care free in Canuckia???... I compare it to the ""free"" military health care I was subjected to for the first 17 yrs. of my life, ok... but nothing to brag aboot!... if the doc was really worth a squat, wouldn't he have a private practice instead of being a Major in the military???  A few years ago they came out with a bulletin ""Military Health Care May Be Hazardous to Your Health""!!!.. Duh???... Really???"
