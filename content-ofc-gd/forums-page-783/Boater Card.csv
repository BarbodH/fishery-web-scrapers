386883,Roy,2009-09-25 14:05:00,13728, He got a temporary card 'til the permanent one arrives in the mail. It's good for 90 days.

386591,JohnF,2009-09-24 16:57:00,3494,"I got my plastic cards in the mail 10 days after writing the course, and I haven't checked the mailbox since Friday. That's pretty good.  JF"
386593,LucG,2009-09-24 17:02:00,779,Mine came fairly quick as well. Was surprised to receive so quick.
386599,mistaredone,2009-09-24 17:27:00,913,Did my test last week. I searched boater card and found an old link that let me do the test for $25
386603,LucG,2009-09-24 17:40:00,779," Wow, the cheapest I could find was $45  I wouldnt get to happy until you get it in the mail...lol   Maybe you got scammed  Just kidding."
386606,[email protected],2009-09-24 18:03:00,290,"I did mine for like $27 CAD.  There was a link on this forum to do it, and I followed it"
386609,Muskieman,2009-09-24 18:14:00,2472,I pushing almost 2 months .... not sign of a card yet... still running on my yellow copy.   RFS 
386611,Roy,2009-09-24 18:25:00,13728, Where did you get yours Randy? The other day I ran across a list of companies testing who had gone out of business.
386612,Muskieman,2009-09-24 18:29:00,2472,   Got at the local MTO Office they offered the course.   40$
386613,acmarou,2009-09-24 18:30:00,63,Best thing I ever did with respect to boating was taking a Power and Sail Squadren course back in 1980. When the card thing started happening I called and got my card in a week. Call it what you want but I think it's a good idea.
386617,Roy,2009-09-24 18:35:00,13728," Well there you go, MTO is government and they're bankrupt aren't they?"
386618,JohnF,2009-09-24 18:38:00,3494, Morally - that's morally bankrupt. As long as they have us all to pay taxes they'll hopefully never be bankrupt. Of course that all flies out the window once they bankrupt each of us.  JF
386622,Joey,2009-09-24 19:01:00,9122,Got mine about 3 days after I took the test.  Paul is coming on two weeks now without his.  Joey
386627,Whopper,2009-09-24 19:06:00,2174, Does that mean you have to drive Paul around
386636,acmarou,2009-09-24 19:32:00,63, That's why I vote Libertarian.   :lol:
386659,huey graphite,2009-09-24 20:43:00,362,    Can either of you tell me where you found these prices?

386711,mistaredone,2009-09-25 00:21:00,913,Thats the one.
386712,JohnF,2009-09-25 00:23:00,3494, I wrote the Operator Card test on the 14th and paid $40 or so.  JF
386741,[email protected],2009-09-25 01:11:00,290,"  You have to go through that special link, otherwise it is the full amount."
