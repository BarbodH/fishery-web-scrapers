386542,HUKDONFAWNIX,2009-09-24 13:48:00,135,Are leeches an effective bait for pickerel?  Do you rig them on jigs?  Or use some other method?  Do GULP Alive leeches work just as well as live ones?  Sorry for all of the questions and thank you in advance for your help!
386544,chuckymcd,2009-09-24 13:49:00,144,i dont know if they work for Pickeral but i think they might work for Walleyes LOL
386546,LucG,2009-09-24 13:52:00,779,"I've never used them either, but have came close to trying.  I've seen people use them on a lindy rig."
386547,Muskieman,2009-09-24 13:52:00,2472,They sure do!!!! Walleye love leeches....  The Gulp aren't as good as the real ones but they work.  you have to add the action with the gulp... as for the real ones they do it for you.  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...mp;#entry383978   RFS 
386549,Jack-of-all-fish,2009-09-24 13:56:00,53,I totally agree Randy. Jack.
386551,anders,2009-09-24 14:02:00,1168,"Agreed  in the summer months, thats what we use...leave the minnows alone.  We put them on jigs, spinners, and even use them on worm harnesses.  A little tip using leeches...if you put them on your lure and they come up wraped in a tight ball...the water is too cold...change your bait to artificial, minnows, or worms...if you bring the leech up and they are stretched like they have been swimming...get ready...you will have a fish on soon."
386553,HUKDONFAWNIX,2009-09-24 14:03:00,135,"Can I use them for ice fishing?  How do I rig the live ones?  Through the ""head"" on a jig?"
386554,LucG,2009-09-24 14:10:00,779," As anders said:   I'm assuming during the winter months, the water would be too cold."
386558,anders,2009-09-24 14:16:00,1168,"  Some people may do it differently, but we hook throught the sucker of the leech first, then again 1/4 down the body to let the rest of the leach move freely...this way the leech is hooked twice, moves nice in the water, and is a lot tougher to get pulled off the hook"
386561,HUKDONFAWNIX,2009-09-24 14:28:00,135,Great info guys!  Theoretically I could use the GULP leeches for ice fishing?  Or should I just use minnows cause the leeches are not naturally available to them in the winter and they may not want them?
386564,wallyboss,2009-09-24 14:39:00,1095,"Can't use the real ones for ice fishing, first they roll up in a ball plus you can't get them in bait shops after September. I haven't tried the Gulp Alive ones ice fishing.   But I like them just as much as the real ones. Plus you don't have to refrigerate, and you will be able to catch 6 walleyes before having to replace it.  To get more action with the Gulp leeches a use my scissors and split the tail in 2."
386572,Kinger,2009-09-24 15:44:00,351,I've never caught a chain pickerel.  I catch all my walleyes on artificial lures.
386668,HUKDONFAWNIX,2009-09-24 21:28:00,135,Anybody try the GULP ALIVE leeches for ice fishing?
386673,GBW,2009-09-24 21:45:00,8460,"I will be this year, LOL!"
