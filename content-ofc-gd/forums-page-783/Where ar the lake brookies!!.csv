386881,BillM,2009-09-25 13:58:00,17367,You had to make another thread about this?
386900,johnnyb,2009-09-25 14:53:00,3413,Do you have any leadcore?  Or just big fat weights and a 3-way swivel?  Or vertical jigging?

387106,singingdog,2009-09-25 23:03:00,1047,"Downrigger clip with a 1/2 oz wt attached will get you down that deep. Clip it directly to your line about 20' above your lure. When you land a fish, take the clip off when it gets to the boat...land the fish with nothing between you and it."
