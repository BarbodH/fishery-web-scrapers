386465,irishfield,2009-09-24 02:39:00,26272,"Well we got back to the lake, after dealing with my Mother's passing, on the 4th of September.  Lloyd knew I needed a ""pick me up"" after attending Mom's funeral and told his boss he was taking the week off. Showing up in Temagami on Sunday the 6th and staying for a full week! The only problem with that Lloyd fella... you need another holiday after he leaves!!! Up at 5:30 and fish 'till dark... Thankfully I told him to bring his own darn boat so if I didn't feel like getting up he could head out on his own, which he did more than once!    We started out the first day downrigging in my boat... with some success.    Then Lloyd wanted to show me how to fish and use his boat... I think we should have stuck to downrigging! LOL    Leah was out with us a few times to share in the laughs... cleaner jokes.. but still some good laughs!    Found out just how big the Lake Herring get..    'tis what it looks like at ""Lloyd o'clock"" !    Lloyd with the big thumbs up after I had him down safe and sound on Eagle Lake.      We paddled around for about 3 hours taking in the gorgeous scenery... . but never saw a minnow.      So we loaded up the canoe and blasted out of there and headed west. ""Hey.. that looks like a neat lake""... Okay !  Landed and anchored.. and unloaded the canoe..    It's lunch time.        Now lets go fishing! We couldn't keep these hammer handles off... numerous double headers hoping we'd find Gramma sooner or later.      Then we found the footballs..    But our cramped up legs needed a stretch so we went walk about for a bit. Now Lloyd's desktop picture!    And a couple more footballs.      After all the flying, 10 hours of being in the sun and paddling... Lloyd was a tad sore. We can fix that...    And he was out for the night ! lol    Next day Lloyd wanted to do Kokoko Lake. Took us 2 hours to get there on sleds in the winter..... dock to Kokoko.. 9 minutes!  Supper! We named him Charlie and held a hook in front of his nose so he would pull when we wanted to move !!    Shore lunch courtesy of Subway! Mercer would be proud! lol    Ended up with 3 pike between us and filleted them up before heading home.    After hours of paddling around Kokoko... the ride home was still where we left it.    Next day we decided to motor up the lake by boat and walk into Brown's lake, that is stocked with Specks. What a beautiful place... but the fish didn't cooperate.      Stopped on the way back to jig for lakers... Lloyd MISSED 4.. I did much better and missed none ! lol    Captain Lloyd heading for home.    and a ragging inferno on Bear Island that had many locals racing home in their boats. Never did find out what was burning.    That's a wrap on Temagami for 2009 ! It's Musky time now on Georgian Bay..."

We don't know each other, other than through a few past PM's, but I wanted to say I am very sorry to read about the passing of both your sister and your Mother. It truly was the summer from hell.  On a lighter note, I had a quite a few laughs as well when reading the posts. Here are some of the funnies:  Sanding dust on face Arriving home to a Fisher petting farm! Your Daughter eating a monster Rocky Lifejacket hat Second arrival home to a turkey petting farm!  Other stuff:  Pop down canoe off of plane Taking your Mom fishing which turned out to be the last time Being able to take a train from the big smoke to your summer escape Celebrating your Mom's life by taking your Daughter fishing before packing up to go home for the funeral Moosebunk being the first reply to part one with ""Doood!! You get only the coolest guests visit."" HA what a riot!"

386852,bicephalic,2009-09-25 12:46:00,112,"Wayne, you're my hero.  Despite your ups and downs it seems you and your family made the most of the summer.  This is the first end of season irishfield report I've been exposed to, and it's definitely a good one.  You had to rub the 9 minutes to Kokoko part in though didn't ya...?  SO jealous.  Johnnyb and I were making a must-fish ice-list the other day...Temagami came up...if you're around, we should try that meet up again.  Just no Siderock - miserable uncooperative brookies..."
386867,Headhunter,2009-09-25 13:25:00,5703,"Don't worry too much about those pics Terry... they probably would have made a sign about my fishing abilities, or lack there of, if they between the two of them, they could figure out how to spell ""Joe""!   And if you look closely at the background of those shots, you can see all the first few attempts at spelling Terry, lying on the ice! HH"
386947,irishfield,2009-09-25 16:03:00,26272,Come on Joe... don't make it so easy....  
386952,Headhunter,2009-09-25 16:26:00,5703,"See, I told yah! LMAO! Thanks for the chuckle Wayne! HH"
