386935,Snowball,2009-09-25 15:46:00,167,"Notice to all fisher persons. The following was posted on Visit My Website Printed, With Permission  A fella here in xxxxxxx ended up getting charged for improper release of a game fish .(Pike if it matters) He was fishing at the old boat launch at the xxxxxxx marina with his 10 year old son off shore ....His son hooked into a nice pike which he battled for 10 mins and released ( the conviction part) My buddies older brother was also there >>>the father dropped the pike from about 1.5 to 2 feet into the water when a fellow yelled at him for abusing the fish upon release.....They both agreed in court that the fish did indeed swim away unharmed but he was still charged with not taking all intensions of not harming the game fish.....He was told in court that no fisherman should bring a fish out of water if he doesn't intend to keep it ! Doesn't this open Pandorahs box a little !!! I mean fishing shows, should be getting sued like crazy,never mind the common angler !!! Just curious on what's the general publics opinion on this one ! It was a bioligist here in xxxxxxx who had him charged....I was wondering if this bioligist had a run in with my buddy before,but apparently not !  Regards, Snowball"

386949,Twocoda,2009-09-25 16:16:00,4130,if the fish went belly up and died ...i would think he had a case ....but ...it didnt so unless there is a written technique to releasing that particular species ...i would think he would beat the charge...what about the dude that used to spit in the mouth of every bass he caught ??? isnt that an assault?  Interesting read though ...im going to follow this thread to see the inputs
386950,highdrifter,2009-09-25 16:20:00,2534,I'd like to know how the heck this got to court in the first place!!  Seems a bit shady to me...  HD

386971,anders,2009-09-25 17:07:00,1168,Seems like it can snowball out of control to me!
386972,Dara,2009-09-25 17:08:00,3052,"Who in court told him you shouldn't bring a fish out of the water, a biologist or a judge that doesn't fish?  PS tell him that pike can jump higher than 2 feet and they land just fine...gonna charge them with ""self abuse""?"
386998,rickster,2009-09-25 17:54:00,495,sounds like a Bull story to me
387004,Lunker777,2009-09-25 18:07:00,866,"WOW ! I guess the musky guys that ""torpedo"" the fish back in water better not bring that guy on board for a trip !"
387028,Greencoachdog,2009-09-25 19:09:00,8163,"  Yeah Buddy!!!... but I'm sorry, I do believe everything I read on the internet!"
