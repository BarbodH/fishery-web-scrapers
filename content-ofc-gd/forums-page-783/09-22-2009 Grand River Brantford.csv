386086,[email protected],2009-09-23 01:48:00,290,"I got home from work and got the fishing itch.  I went out and got a dozen worms and headed down to Cockshutt bridge.  Alot of people fish right under the bridge, and thats ok, but the better spots are upstream and downstream around the bends.  I walked and found a new spot that I'm going to hit up early morning on the weekend. It seems to drop off to fairly deep water almost immediately.  I tossed my White Jig with White twister tail on it for a bit, but didn't get any hits. So I went back to trusty Worm + Hook.  Got this guy after about 30 seconds.    2.1lbs   Then this guy almost took my pole in the water.   The mosquitos started to get REALLY bad and I had to take a 15 minute trek through the dark and mysterious forest in the pitch black. So I decided to cast out one more time while I cleaned up.  I haven't ever caught a sucker this big before. He fought like a champ. Put him on the scale,  3.6lbs.    The pictures don't really do it justice. I tried to show the scale by putting the Gulp spray next to it.  I don't really like catching suckers/catfish, but when nothing else is biting, they are always a fun fish to catch  Until next time..."
386092,EC1,2009-09-23 01:56:00,930,"Nice suckers Ultyma! Wonder where all the game fish went in the grand river.  Rare to see a sucker report at this time of the year, and to that I congratulate you"
386094,[email protected],2009-09-23 02:01:00,290,  I've never been able to find a decent spot to consistently catch bass/walleye from the shore.  I've walked the shore up and down for miles
386099,timmeh,2009-09-23 02:08:00,609,"Keep trying man, they're in there. I had several trips with minimal success on the Grand before I started to consistently get into fish. If you keep putting in the effort I'm sure you'll find them too. I'm not overly familiar with that stretch of the Grand but bass are everywhere in the river so if you're walkin the miles you'll get into them. Sometimes the bite is just cold. We've had some weird weather the last few days and that may have slowed them down."
386102,[email protected],2009-09-23 02:14:00,290," Yeah  I seem to be able to find the small  < 1lb smallies everywhere, but I can never find their parents"
386113,Greencoachdog,2009-09-23 02:35:00,8163,   .. and that would be a Red Horse!  You should really brush up on your creek/river species ID.
386116,[email protected],2009-09-23 02:43:00,290," It looks like the first sucker that I caught, but bigger. lol..  I've never even heard of a ""red horse"""
386118,Greencoachdog,2009-09-23 02:54:00,8163,"  Notice the size and color of the dorsal, pectoral, and anular fins... very large... they confused between carp and suckers, the are Actually Red Horses!  Pick out the one it looks like to you.  http://www.picsearch.com/pictures/animals/...e%20sucker.html"
386121,[email protected],2009-09-23 02:59:00,290, Ahhh  Very cool.  Thanks for the lesson GCD   I learned something new today!
386148,fishing,2009-09-23 04:09:00,167,"Nice redhorse sucker. Thanks for the report. There are a lot of them in the Grand. The biggest one I caught was 27"". They are mostly in deep water now. One of the best times to catch them is from now to mid November.  Can get 20 of them in an hour or two from a good hole. Many in 19 or 20'' range. Not a lot of people keep them, so we see more sucker and bigger sucker each year."
386326,LeXXington,2009-09-23 20:32:00,1928,"Nice catch,"
386425,JEREMY,2009-09-24 00:52:00,300,"Isent you a pm about another spot,but your spot has its time when its good"
386570,Ade,2009-09-24 15:28:00,1,"Try hitting up Wilkes dam, We caught some pretty good sized Carp this week "
386577,[email protected],2009-09-24 15:59:00,290,"  I go to Wilkes Dam all the time, but there's normally like 10 people down on that ledge so there's no room.  What were you using to catch the carp?"
386776,Leecher,2009-09-25 02:40:00,7832,Great report and pics Ultyma Looks like your decision to head out after work paid off....  Congrats on the 3.6Lbs redhorse Real beauty!!! Thanks for sharing Leechman
