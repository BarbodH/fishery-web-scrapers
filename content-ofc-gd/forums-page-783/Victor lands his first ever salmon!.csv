386922,MJL,2009-09-25 15:24:00,2427,"Last night both Victor and I were free.  I had on good authority that a few fresh chinnies and a good run of browns were starting to make their way up one river.  Victor having not yet landed a salmon before was dying to give it a go.  Last year when I took him, he got his first taste of salmon when he lost 2 off the pier which literally DESTROYED him.  Earlier this year I promised I would get him into some more before year end.  I took Victor to a spot not far from the river mouth.  Sure enough we could see some fish rolling about in the wide, deep pool.  The whole night we had that pool to ourselves and could fish in peace.  Quite a number of fish were leaping clear out of the water with lampreys still attached.  Victor wasn’t getting any hookups.  I managed to land a few fish on bags of skein scrape.  Also managed to break the tip of my 13’6” Raven IM9 while fighting a fish – Took 10 inches off the top when I walked into a tree but I guess I turned it into a pretty sweet chinny stick with even more backbone.  After a long night of sheer persistence, Victor finally landed his first ever salmon.  Sort of…  Victor unhooking the beast   Victor’s hero shot   Who says Catch, Fillet & Release doesn’t work?"

386927,Greencoachdog,2009-09-25 15:30:00,8163,"That's sick dude!!!... Funny as hell  , but sick!  Congrats to Victor!!!  ... maybe you'll catch one with a little more meat on his bones next time!"
386929,Twocoda,2009-09-25 15:34:00,4130,Kate Moss salmon....
386931,Toronto_Angler,2009-09-25 15:43:00,698,Gross
386932,frozen-fire,2009-09-25 15:45:00,542,"wow...crazy!  i'm gonna give river fishing a go tomorrow morning for the first time ever.  Thanks for the info you have provided victor, i'll let you know what happens and whether or not you'll be seeing me in the fall for steel haha"
386937,Victor,2009-09-25 15:49:00,1609," That certainly was a new PB, although it's not legit (snagged in the guts... wait... if i deep hook a fish, the hook WOULD be in his guts... so ... lets just say it's legit haha).  As you can see, i'm not really the best person to ask for advice lol (with my limited experience out there), i hope you do bettter  than me though."
386940,JohnF,2009-09-25 15:51:00,3494, Did ya weigh it?  JF
386946,Victor,2009-09-25 16:01:00,1609," It's in my fridge right now, i'll let you know when i get home  And for everyone else who wants to know how I caught this beast: A roe bag drifted near the bottom at a relatively deep pool with a small steelhead hook. This thing also gave me quite the fight,  the float shot straight down right away when I hooked him. Unfortunately I think I was overly excited, palmed the reel too hard so it couldn't pull much line out."
386953,Weekend Warrior,2009-09-25 16:28:00,27,You shouldn't lift big females like that out of the water.  It stresses the fish.
386961,Twocoda,2009-09-25 16:50:00,4130,Tightline- if you happen to see this post...this is the type of fish I think Roy was referring to in the other thread
386963,ricoboxing,2009-09-25 16:55:00,398,u ate the fish before the picture!
386966,BillM,2009-09-25 17:00:00,17367,"Victor, looks like some eastern European dude got to that fish first"
386981,bassassin,2009-09-25 17:24:00,152,WOW i hope you had a gallon of purel hand sanitzer to bathe in after that!!!
386983,bigreddog,2009-09-25 17:26:00,84,I think you set the hook too hard.
386994,wolfville,2009-09-25 17:49:00,396,"Victor, you could get into serious trouble if you dump that thing on shore, you know that? .... doesn't matter, you are in serious trouble already without inviting me last night LOL  You'll land a proper one next time I'm sure."
386995,Jet,2009-09-25 17:50:00,364,Man that is awesome! Way to go Victor. Looks like they did a good fillet job.
387008,Trevor0179,2009-09-25 18:17:00,65,Nice fish Victor it's sad but i see those all over the place when im out anyway im sure theres one with your name on it out there this season we should get out soon
387056,Victor,2009-09-25 20:36:00,1609," Uh Trevor! It's been a while, hope all is well. We shall go for another carp outing at hamilton sometime in the near future, they're putting on the feedbag this time of the year."
387074,splashhopper,2009-09-25 21:24:00,2931,"you caught a ""pre-filleted"" salmon  Call up Loblaws, you just might get your own ""president's choice"" line"
387084,mbosh1980,2009-09-25 21:54:00,349,we need a barf smiley
387095,PikeMolester,2009-09-25 22:32:00,428,i rly dont understand what happened?
387097,JohnF,2009-09-25 22:40:00,3494, Dude. It was too skinny to have any pulling power. You should have been able to reel it in AND eat yer chicken at the same time.  JF
