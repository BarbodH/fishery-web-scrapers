386973,Twocoda,2009-09-25 17:09:00,4130,Granted he is a talent ...but when he threw his pissy fits when he was a prominent member of the flames...he tarnished himself...real nice guy in person though ..last i heard he was playing overseas and doing very well ...   GO FLAMES GO !!!!
387009,jediangler,2009-09-25 18:17:00,1923,"The Leafs should grab him and play him until Kessel returns from shoulder rehab. At least he would throw a bodycheck or two, more than you'll see out of Kessel all season. They can probably get him for next to nothing on a 1 year deal. I'd like to see someone give him a chance."
387011,Lunatic,2009-09-25 18:28:00,536,"Very shocking news. he played 6-11 min a game and was one of the top point getters on the team. Toronto should be all over this, they need a team leader and a captain and i cant think of anyone out there right now that would better him in those roles right now. he can be picked up and a very low cost,and his experience,and passion are priceless. if toronto can trade and put useless people on there team as salery dumps for others,then theo shouldnt even be a disscussion,he should be there."
387012,BrownTown,2009-09-25 18:31:00,103,"Sad indeed, someone get Theo, he deserves it!"
387120,siwash,2009-09-25 23:43:00,683,He's 41 and hasn't played professional hockey in 6 years...  It's a young man's sport  good luck to Theo in his future endeavors
387137,kickingfrog,2009-09-26 00:28:00,8333,"For all of our talk of overpaid athletes, it is fact that there are thousands of people ready to take a pro's job away. Every game, every practice and every off-season. If you are really lucky your career is 15 maybe 20 years long and then your cast aside. Most of us do not have to preformed with that type of pressure and scrutiny at our jobs. For the most part the elite pros are paid very well, but is not all lolli-pops and hugs."
387166,Rizzo,2009-09-26 02:19:00,4754,who says he would want to play for the leafs? I think this was just a nice gesture by the flames to let him go out on a high note rather than as an embarrassment. I don't think either side truly believed he would make the team.
387176,Dutchy,2009-09-26 02:36:00,416, What he said ^^^^
