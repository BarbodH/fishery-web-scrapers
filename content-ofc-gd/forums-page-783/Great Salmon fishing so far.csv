My other two buddies also landed 2 and lost couple more using roe and marshmelow both on the same time. Fish were fighting hard so far! It was a good evening fishing from 9:30-1:00am. One of the photo shows the fellow who was kind enough to help me land the fish, He was somewhat drunk and overly friendly. http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing043.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing045.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/b.../fishing046.jpg  This year has been a lucky year for me for this Salmon hunt. 14th Salmon landed to date in 5 outing. However, 5-6 years ago, the run was even way better.  It was a NE east , and surprisingly, fishing was good at our spot. We could have caught more, but have to go to work the next day."
