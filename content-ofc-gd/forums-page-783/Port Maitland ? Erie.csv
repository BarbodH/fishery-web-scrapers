386381,FISHINGNUT,2009-09-23 23:42:00,253,I was thinking of trying for some walleyes and bows this weekend if I can get out .I was going to launch out of Port Maitland I have downriggers for my boat ( never used   ) I was wondering how far off shore would I have to run to get deep enough ? .I have never really fished Erie before but heard it has a real gradual slope to it.I have a 17.5 ft bow rider with a 50 hp and know it can be a very dangerous lake .Not sure if I should wate a few weeks till they start moving closer to the mouth of the Grand ? Thanks Winds are supposed to be out of the South is that bad ? what the best wind direction other than zero

386467,FISHINGNUT,2009-09-24 02:47:00,253,thanks Dave but what  I was wondering approx how many miles would I have to go out to hit deeper water
386573,canadadude,2009-09-24 15:45:00,769,"Port Maitland drops off realativly fast, a couple of miles out your in 60', Steve at fishmasters can really help you out and he has a good ramp right there. The other thing is south winds especially SW can make for rough water on Erie"

386664,LeXXington,2009-09-24 21:06:00,1928,60 feet is about 5-6K out. The winds are not looking good for the weekend 25 from the south. This will make it very bumpy and there is no safety getting closer to shore. North Winds are best down there.  I was going to head out but with the winds I might just stay in the river.  Erie is differnt waves than Huron \ Ontario. They have a lot more chop and less roll.  Stay safe
386698,FISHINGNUT,2009-09-24 23:42:00,253,I think I will wait for a calmer day too. Great to know that North winds is what to watch fore for a calmer day on the water.First time out I dont want to be sunk just for a fish
