They decided to hand it over to the police after revealing their find to their mother and getting some legal advice.  ""We just don't want any trouble,"" one of the boys, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Lismore Northern Star newspaper. ""We were sweet before the money and we'll be sweet afterwards.""  The boys had been fishing at Tuntable Creek, a waterway near Lismore in the tropical region of far northern New South Wales on Australia's east coast.  The creek is near Nimbin, a small town known as the home of Australia's hippy culture, which hosts an annual MardiGrass festival devoted to promoting the use of cannabis.  The region had recently been affected by huge flooding so the bundle may have come from any number of streams in the area, known as the Northern Rivers region.  Inspector Greg Moore said that officers were investigating whether the discovery was crime-related.  ""That's obviously one line of inquiry we're looking at,"" he said. ""It could be proceeds of ill-gotten gains but at this stage we're certainly keeping an open mind.""  Inspector Moore said that if nobody came forward with a legitimate reason for claiming the money, the boys might be able to claim it."
