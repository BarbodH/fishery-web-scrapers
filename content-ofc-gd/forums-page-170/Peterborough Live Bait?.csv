921411,SirWhite,2015-06-24 11:50:00,210,"Hi everyone, just about to do a trip up to the Peterborough Area, does anyone know of a live bait place up there? The Internet can only say so much"
921420,mattybculp,2015-06-24 13:13:00,388,"I guess it depends on where you mean when you say Peterborough area. There aren't really any great live bait/ tackle shops in Peterborough per say. If your fishing rice there's BJs tackle in Bewdley, If your fishing the tri-lakes see Frank at Bridgenorth tackle in Bridgenorth, In lakefield there is a small tackle shop on the main drag opposite side of the high school and beside an art shop, if your looking for just worms, there in every convenience store and gas station. There used to be a tiny place on Lansdowne st between lock 19 and Ashburnham by the TSC store, but I have only been in there once and for some reason I don't think they are open anymore, but I could be wrong. Its hard to believe that in a town with so much great fishing around that no tackle stores can survive, and most rely on crappie tire for tackle. Me personally I go out and see Frank and shoot the breeze with him for a bit and support local businesses."
921422,Sinker,2015-06-24 13:18:00,8692,"Yep, what he said ^  Its silly that there is not a great bait and tackle shop in PTBO. Its pretty much the heart of the kawartha's.  If you tell us where abouts you will be staying, I could maybe offer more info on bait shops. The one Matt mentioned in PTBO on lansdowne is closed down. If your in the lindsay/bobcaygeon area there is Kawartha Bait and Tackle in Lindsay, and Marks Worm warehouse just south of bobcaygeon. Both good shops.    S."
921430,TenInchJake,2015-06-24 14:32:00,21,"There is a new place on Park St S near Braidwood. Never been in there, but I noticed it was there. It's not very big."

921455,SirWhite,2015-06-24 15:58:00,210,"Thanks so far guys. Ill actually be just outside Peterborough (south) on the Otanabee. And I'm really looking for minnows, worms are everywhere lol"
921470,mattybculp,2015-06-24 16:45:00,388,make the trip to BJS tackle in Bewdley. He has minnows.
921471,Sinker,2015-06-24 16:47:00,8692,"Yep, BJ's is your only option that I know of for minnows, or bring a minnow trap and put it in one of the small creeks along the way.  I live 5 mins from the otonabee and never fish it lol  S."
