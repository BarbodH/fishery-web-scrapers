920669,ecmilley,2015-06-19 01:30:00,2163,Cliff loblaws has agreat seafood counter with 3 deleverys a week from east coast. Not sure on pricing. But they had a tank full last te i was in
920675,cram,2015-06-19 02:37:00,1733,As far as I know they close the lobster season in the Maritimes for 2 months while they are moulting. The timing varies with the region. I know every time we travelled to PEI in July their season was closed. During these times you can still get fresh lobster but they've been stored in pounds and are losing flesh. Go to the other side of the island and the season may be open.  I'm pretty sure they alternate seasons.
920696,123chadder,2015-06-19 14:53:00,165,this thread put lobster on my brain so i did some research and found this place.......overnight shipping and cheapest i could find......  and i made an order  http://www.lobsterworld.com/
920706,cram,2015-06-19 15:57:00,1733,"btw - good for you, Cliff.  Sounds just about perfect."

920795,Big Cliff,2015-06-20 11:46:00,6899,"Well, I've checked out all the leads and a few that weren't mentioned here and it works out that if you want FRESH live lobster delivered to your door here in Ontario you are going to be paying about $20.00 ea for 1 to 1 1/2 lb lobster (estimated on qty of 10)including freight.  Tank lobster from Loblaws are going to run you about $10.99/lb unless you can find them on special and that can be hit and miss and the quality isn't going to be anywhere near that good.  Now, I was just thinking that if a few of us wanted to get together and place an order...... the freight cost would come down on a per lobster basis as the quantity goes up...... Anyone in the Kawartha's area that might be interested?  Here is how it would work: total number of lobster ordered/the total cost= your cost per lobster but you have to pick them up here on the day of delivery (would have to be a Friday afternoon/evening because Saturday freight would be extra. BTW, on an order of 50 cost would average $16.00 ea for an average lobster of 1.25 lbs.  If you are interested let me know and I'll see if we can put it together."
920892,bigugli,2015-06-21 02:04:00,6138,"  To be quite honest, I'm not sure. It's been a few years since I last flew in lobster. The Mrs does not like seafood."
921555,SirCranksalot,2015-06-25 00:21:00,3291,I've caught crayfish on the river here that are almost as big as some of those store bought lobsters! Let me know if you want any----you can have 'em for free!  When I was still working we had a 'lobsterfest' on a Fri aft in June for a few years. We had them flown in from PEI and they came out to about $20 each.
921562,pics,2015-06-25 00:41:00,1268,"There is a difference in taste depending on where they are caught.. well, that's what the fishermen in Cape Breton tell me.. St Paul island lobster was the best I've ever had.. of course I got it right off the boat when it came in.. they offered me a huge one that wouldn't fit in our pot so I opted for 3 in the 2+ lb range . Best part of it all is that they wouldn't accept any money. If I could get some shipped from there I would do it in a heartbeat."

921787,bigugli,2015-06-26 11:12:00,6138,  Gotta admit I'm partial to Fundy lobster.
920511,Big Cliff,2015-06-17 23:20:00,6899,"OK, I have been working stupid long hours lately and I have decided thet I am going to enjoy myself.  Where is the best place to order fresh live lobsters about 1.5 lbs and delivered to my door would be an asset cause I am too busy to go get them. Found one place on the internet, $11.99/lb plus $70.00 freight for 10 of them.  Are there better deals? Might be willing to order 20+ if the deal was good enough."
920518,Roy,2015-06-18 00:02:00,13728,The Metro store in Peterborough had them at $5.99 each last week. (from PEI) I have no idea what they're going for this week.
920520,Big Cliff,2015-06-18 00:08:00,6899,"Thanks Roy! Those are canners (typically 1/2 to 3/4 lb). I am looking for something a little bigger, 1 1/2 to 2 lbs.. The larger sizes are usually more expensive but worth it!"
920521,cheaptackle,2015-06-18 00:13:00,849,Metro in Orillia had the size you wanted for 9.99/lb. swimming around the tank.   Might be worth a call to the fish counter of your local Metro and see what they can do fer ya!  Michael
920523,Roy,2015-06-18 00:15:00,13728,"I've never seen them that small, Cliff. Can't buy them under 1 1/4 lb here."

920535,captpierre,2015-06-18 01:16:00,2521,I've been disappointed with live  bought lobsters. Most of the time they have claws that are half full of water when opened. I think it is when lobsters are stored in pounds and basically live off their flesh. I'd pay extra to have fresh caught lobsters sent from the Maritimes. Not sure how to ensure  fresh caught.
920540,manjo39,2015-06-18 01:36:00,354,I can pick up a McLobster for you on the way up.

920556,HTHM,2015-06-18 02:53:00,4082,"Canners are the best tasting, the bigger the lobster, the tougher the flesh."
920558,Gallie,2015-06-18 02:59:00,1215,Ive gotten lobsters from sobeys stores before and they were pretty good.
920559,Sinker,2015-06-18 02:59:00,8692,This^  Find a place on the east coast and have them sent here. The lobster you get out of the tanks suck IMO.  S.
920562,leaf4,2015-06-18 03:07:00,2466,"Don't know the company that does it, but there is one in Moncton airport  that my girlfriends uncle used when he came over a couple summers ago, they pack the freshly caught lobster and it gets sent out from there ill see if I can find a site"
920572,ketchenany,2015-06-18 11:00:00,3229,Call Seacore in Woodbridge and see if they deliver! There is a new place called toppins here also they may help too.  manjo can pick up
920574,BITEME,2015-06-18 11:12:00,1968,Morning Cliff  In my opinion the best way to go is order from Clearwater In Bedford Nova Scotia may cost a little more but you will get the primes you want and not these digusting tank lobsters in the store around here. Cheers Peter  http://www.clearwater.ca/en/home/seafood-retail/lobster/live-lobster.aspx#Packaging_  you want the selects they are hands down best taste and bang for the buck
920582,ckewley,2015-06-18 12:18:00,699,"I'll second BITEME on Clearwater, they hold a monopoly on the airport & portside lobsters but their quality is good.  Now if you were traveling out there I could point you in a few directions!"
920592,MSBruno,2015-06-18 13:33:00,369,"We order every year for a family lobster fest ... found them when we took our RV trip out there.  Big, professional operation. "

920657,Big Cliff,2015-06-18 21:52:00,6899,"Thanks for all the replies! I've tried the ""tank"" lobster and it's like comparing round steak to rib eye. Ok but if I am going to spend the money I'd rather spend a little extra and really enjoy it! Two years ago when Sue and I did our East coast trip we really got to taste the differance between fresh & FRESH! I'd rather pay twice the price and have the good stuff because I only do it once a year!"
920659,bigugli,2015-06-18 22:12:00,6138,I'm spoiled. I can just dial up my uncle and he can take a 1/2 hour drive to the cove.
