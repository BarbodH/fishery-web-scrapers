921392,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-24 02:49:00,8243,"Bondar, good for you, we used to run the rapids in a 12 footer on the Ottawa River. That was 30 years ago. I""m too old too tired too sore and too experienced now to do the things I used to do. Have fun and call me in 30 years, actually don't bother I will have been dead because of boredom."
921397,joeybacala,2015-06-24 03:05:00,63,"I have to agree with an earlier post and go with a new one if finances allow for it. It will hold value and come with warranty which will give you peace of mind. This being your first boat and $5000 is your budget do you really want a project?  I too am in the market and toyed with both options. Looking on the want ads and seeing what people are asking for their boats and the age of the equipment my hard earned money will better serve me with a new one. Some of the prices are way out there. and what is affordable is either a project or in some cases junk. And that's only for starters, what about the motor that doesn't come with warranty and according to 85% of the ads "" well maintained"" or "" runs great""  Just my opinion."
921398,Dara,2015-06-24 03:08:00,3052,"no payments, start with used then figure out what you like and need A boat is a want not a need and never finance a want   Ummm...excuse me?  Sorry but thats a NEED to me"
921401,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-24 03:27:00,8243,"Just because it's a used boat sold privately does not mean there can't be a written warranty. If someone says it runs great and doesn't leak write that into the sales agreement. Not everything sold privately has to be as is. Make them put their money where their mouth is. If you say great I will buy it,  just guarantee the 9.9 for 30 days and a 30 day leak warranty. Take pics of the hull before to prove you didn't smash it against the rocks. As for the 9.9 or whatever if you don't have the expertise take someone with you that does to do a compression test. Once shown a 10 year old can do a compression test , check those plugs and listen for bearing knock. I have looked at boats and the owner would not run it in the driveway on the rabbit ears with a dozen excuses, or looked at me like I had 2 heads when I said if you guarantee it write it down. One guy actually said if it's a private sale you can't have a warranty.  I have probably brokered 30 boat sales in the last 8 years. No warranty or a real deal after all due diligence see ya buddy, simple as that.  Oh if Revenue Canada is reading this, I do people favors and they give me birthday and Christmas gifts."
921404,manitoubass2,2015-06-24 03:52:00,11391,"Dont listen to oldironmaker, he sucks at golf.  Buy new! You wont regret it!"
921406,porkpie,2015-06-24 04:08:00,2521,WORD!!!!!  You can buy a whole lot of tin boat for $5K
921410,DanD,2015-06-24 11:18:00,2223,"I grew up on a 14 footer so that's what I'm comfortable with.  That says a lot right there; buy what you feel comfortable with. Think of the gadgets your dad's boat doesn't have and you would like. Things like a little more HP, power trim/tilt, proper nav lighting, so you can (legally) stay out after sun down; even something simple as a bilge pump? All the things that will make your day out more enjoyable for you. 5K for boat, motor and trailer, will likely put you into a basic bare bones new boat; 5K used and you'd likely have money left over for some toys?  Dan."
921473,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-24 16:51:00,8243,"Something I want to mention when buying new or used depending on what comes with the boat or what you can get thrown into the deal by the seller is the cost of a few accessories. With a blink of an eye you will spend $1000.00. Entry level GPS combo, a few fenders, 50 feet of rope and an anchor, a hand held VHF radio, a few good quality like vests or PFD's, a cheap safety kit, an oar, what else, a new gas tank and hose ( I almost had a heart attach when I bought these 2 items last year for my new kicker) that's a base package for must haves I think. You are  over $1000.00. On a $5000.00 tinny that's 20% of your boat price."

920792,LostAnotherOne,2015-06-20 10:12:00,956,"Just wondering guys what the process is when buying your first boat.  I'm looking for a 14' aluminum with maybe a 9.9 on the back.  I may finance it, but if there's a place I could get a decent one used I will go for that.  Thanks in advance."
920793,frodobuggins,2015-06-20 10:20:00,127,What you do will depend on your financial circumstances. I think if you could pay cash for a used one that might be the way to go. That way if you grow out of the boat in a few years you're not tied to a monthly payment. I bought a used boat off kijiji this spring after toying with new.
920799,chris.brock,2015-06-20 12:15:00,4053,Kijiji for sure.  It helps to be quick when a new listing pops up.  Bring some muffs too so you can run the motor in the guys driveway using a garden hose to feed the cooling system.
920804,sauce,2015-06-20 12:40:00,219,"For your very first boat, a basic used tinner with a small outboard is a good idea. Add fish finder trolling motor etc down the road as budget allows. Use it for a year or two and decide if you want a bigger boat or maybe a better small rig. Or maybe you'll be satisfied and can invest some time and money to fine tune your rig so it's perfect for you. It's amazing what you can do with a 14 or 16 foot aluminum boat with bench seats. Lots of potential at minimal cost. Take your time and really plan out any updates and you can have professional results."
920834,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2015-06-20 16:14:00,535,"Definitely used for your first boat. You don't want to be stuck paying for something you grew out of, like already mentioned. My first boat was a 14'er with a 9.9. It was old and ugly but I had a blast with it, you can take them almost anywhere and they are super easy to launch by yourself.  Good luck with your purchase and congrats on buying a boat! Your bank account will suffer but it's worth it."
920883,Paudash,2015-06-21 00:52:00,273,"no payments, start with used then figure out what you like and need A boat is a want not a need and never finance a want"
920893,ccmtcanada,2015-06-21 02:51:00,7971,As everyone else has said....go used.   What's your budget?
920897,Joeytier,2015-06-21 04:24:00,3990,"Sounds like you aren't yet sure what you're looking to get out of your boat.  I would suggest buying an old 14/9.9 rig on a trailer (dime a dozen on kijiji) and get a feel for what you like and don't like about it, and more importantly get familiar with the level of maintenance required to keep a rig in tip-top shape (likely more than you think if you e never owned one before).  The big things you need to know when looking at a used unit is seeing the motor run (ask about lower unit seals and impeller, gear oil etc), compression tester if you have one, age and condition of trailer bearings, tires, leaky rivets.  You'll get a good idea from how the seller responds as to how well the boat was taken care of."
920898,manitoubass2,2015-06-21 04:50:00,11391,"Im kinda on the other side of the fence.  If you can afford it, id buy brand new for a 14ft and 9.9.  Youll have zero issues. Take care of it, have fun. It still has its resale value. But once you learn what you want in a boat, you still have this one on the side for smaller lakes and getaways, or sell if you so choose.  A 14ft with a 9.9 doesnt run alot of money. And brand new you can run the thing for 30 years with proper care and maintenance. Thats a good investment.  But i do back the ""no finance if possible"".  If ya cant afford it save up. Save where you can. Frig cash in on recyclibles etc if ya can.  Or put 50 bucks a week in a jar. Youll have the cash in no time"
920905,Shloim,2015-06-21 10:35:00,515,"I pulled the trigger on my first boat last year. I bought a 16' side console with a 40hp. The whole package in new like condition was 5k and that turned into 6k in the blink of an eye when the trolling motor it came with, fried. The boat leaks a bit (which bugs me) but I didn't water test it although I did compression test and run the motor. (excellent motor) I otherwise could not be happier with my purchase. Anyway my point is, this boat was 3 grand more than the ""nice"" bare bones tinners i saw and Im glad I waited an extra season and got a little more boat. But there are many good used ones out there on kijiji etc. in the $1500 to $3000 range. Better to make your mistakes in a less expensive package and upgrade once you figure it all out. IMO... since you asked  also if you would fell more comfortable get a used one from a dealer, you'll pay a little more but will get some support and a possible warranty too..."
920927,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-21 15:42:00,8243,"I would suggest no one finance a toy. My first boat was a 12 foot Sears cartop and a old 9.9. The second time on that boat I started looking for a 14 footer, then a 16 etc. 2 footitis is a common virus that is contagious amonst boaters. A 14 foot tinny is the way to go for a first time boat. Depending on your responsibilities the financing option may or may not be the way to go. If you have the responsibilities that come with life, like a family to feed forget about financing a toy. If single add 2 feet to your boat shopping every week and get yourself as large a boat you want. After you have bought a home of course."
920930,ccmtcanada,2015-06-21 15:56:00,7971,"I agree not to finance if possible, which is why I asked what his budget is.  From there we can suggest options. Either way, boat shopping is exciting!! Lol"

921112,LostAnotherOne,2015-06-22 19:56:00,956,"Been busy working lately so thanks tons guys.  I appreciate all the help, but looking for a boat this fall when I change cars.  Looking to spend $5000+.  May purchase it new cause I want something that will last.  My dad bought his new over 20 years ago and we still use.  Just had to change the motor once.  I got a few more questions.  What size trailer hitch should I have on my truck if I'm pulling a 14'?  I'm thinking class two.  What about when it comes time to pick it up do I have to have license plates ready to throw on it when I drive home?  Do I need need to charge my battery?  Trolling motor batteries need to be charged, but what about the one for the boat motor?  When it comes to a truck should I have a 4X4?  Thanks"
921118,John Bacon,2015-06-22 20:44:00,3277,"You can probably tow a 14' with a class I; but if you are going to get a truck you may as well get a class III.  There isn't that much difference in price; and then you can tow pretty much anything.  A class III hitch can also be used for bike racks.  If you are buying from a dealer, they should take care of the trailer plates for you.  If you are buying privately then you will need to transfer the trailer ownership.  Plates can be transfered, or you can get your own.  Four wheel drive is nice; especially in late fall when the ramps may be icey.   But you shouldn't have any trouble with two wheel drive on most ramps.  If you are using your boat regularily, the main battery should not need to be recharged... except over the winter."
921127,BillM,2015-06-22 21:40:00,17367,For $5000 you'll get a much better deal in the used market.
921134,chris.brock,2015-06-22 23:38:00,4053,"For a 14'/ 9.9, class 1 is fine, 4 cyl car, don't need 4x4 truck.  I would look for a fairly new, used outfit with a Japanese motor, just my opinion"
921170,FloatnFly,2015-06-23 03:35:00,1640,"You can get a pretty decent boat for $5000 on the used market, for instance, my dad just bought himself a 1990 Searay cutty cabin with 4.3l merc 24ft with trailer for $4000.  Just saw a 20ft SeaRay bowrider with 4.3L merc for $4600  If you have the cash on hand, do not finance, you'll end paying more in interest than anything else, plus, those monthly payments can be put towards gas, upgrades, fishing gear, so many possibilities"
921306,davew3,2015-06-23 20:08:00,430,"I find this surprising.  No one has asked.  Where will you be fishing?  Towing distance?  Big water ?  Little water ?  How many in the boat?  For how long ?  What will you be fishing for?   Shallow, deep ?  With a decent budget a 16ft may be in order.  Regards"
921327,leaf4,2015-06-23 21:15:00,2466,"Agreed but maybe he's looking at a 14 for storage options? When I end up seriously looking into a boat that will be the first measurement I take, hoping to get at least a 17 realistically"
921374,LostAnotherOne,2015-06-24 00:41:00,956,"I grew up on a 14 footer so that's what I'm comfortable with.  Also that size would fit nicely in my garage.  I fish year round from channel cats at Dunnville in the spring to muskies at Niagara in the fall.  Shallow or deep don't matter.  Just want something reliable that's I wont have issues with down the road cause taking the boat out once a week is the norm for me.  I've been taking my dads boat out for a few years now so I like to think I know what I'm doing lol, but it's not the same as your own boat."

Great shape for a 89. Heck you would think I'm selling it, I'm not. You won't be towing this around. My point is for 5K there's a lot of boats out there slightly used."
