Well, I posted it on Kijiji and sure enough someone wanted it, dead or alive. He paid me for the unit and the extraction, and he can deal with the shipping to Manitoba (not cheap!).  A local crew did me a big favor and yanked 'er out. Check it out.                  "

920815,Walleye72,2015-06-20 14:39:00,156,Very Cool!  Any idea how old it is?
920820,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-20 15:06:00,8243,"We yanked out an old steam turbine that hoisted raw materials to the top of  ""A""  Blast Furnace that was torn down in the 70's and donated it to the Steam Museum in Hamilton. The boiler work looks similar. That furnace was built in the 1890's."
920824,Rod Caster,2015-06-20 15:19:00,5784,"I assume it's early 1900's, but there are some parts that are newer than original."
920844,OhioFisherman,2015-06-20 17:10:00,6623,"At one time they had steam farm tractors, i became very leery of being around any that were still operating after an incident here.  http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=92758  One of my son's friend was badly burned, as was his father who also lost an eye."
920862,spincast,2015-06-20 20:44:00,3279,"cool looking tractor. I suspect when its all put together its gonna look pretty darn awesome.Those old steam units are amazing. umm,,,, That looks like a lot of grass to cut? Have you trained the sheep that well already?"
920865,misfish,2015-06-20 21:15:00,29133,"Someone wanted that real bad, and you did well.  Now for the pics next winter."
920872,Rod Caster,2015-06-20 22:10:00,5784,It's in pretty rough shape...I assume the buyer will use it for parts  My lawn cost exactly the price of a 24 of Coors Light to get cut haha.
