When we were out today,decided - what the heck, nothing else has fired since the first 45 minutes out.   piggy here didn't seem too concerned about chowing down on the the ugly duckling of the lake   Brian B - I took your recommendation and went fly fishing. G caught this one on a green tinsel special I call the wet damsel    wasn't much, but it sure was better than the alternative. Happy father's day all."
