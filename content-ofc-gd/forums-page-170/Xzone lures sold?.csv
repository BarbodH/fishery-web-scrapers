920703,16sailor,2015-06-19 15:52:00,38,Got some inside news from a reliable source Apparently the deal fell through and the buyer got stuck with the close to $2000 in lawyer bills thanks to them. I guess there is a long list of people that have been screwed by xzone. So it's not happening sorry to break it to ya.

920766,Pikeslayer,2015-06-20 00:24:00,1443,Now spreading rumours & innuendo could end up in you getting screwed and tacking on an extra zero to defend yourself in court. I wonder how your sponsors would react to your questionable actions??????
