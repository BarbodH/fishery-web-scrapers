921429,fish_d00d,2015-06-24 14:31:00,38,"Looking for a recommendation for fishing guides on Rice lake. We have 8 people who want to fish. Can anyone recommend a captain who can take 8 people out, or 2 boats with 4 guys in each? Hoping to get some action on bass or walleye  Thanks in advance!"
921447,Mister G,2015-06-24 15:36:00,1429,"Sinker, he's a member here."
921472,Sinker,2015-06-24 16:50:00,8692,"I don't guide, and I actually don't know of any guides on rice that could accommodate a group that size. Sorry.  If you want some general fishing info, shoot me a pm. You might be better off renting a pontoon boat in Bewdley for the day and trying it on your own.  S."
921483,fishnsled,2015-06-24 17:25:00,3520,"As another option, you could also check out http://curtispointcottages.com/  Will (family business) is a member here and knows the lake pretty well.  They rent boats too.  Greg Klatt is a member on the board and might be able to help out as a guide.  http://www.profishntanglingservices.com/   For a group that size it will be tough to find anyone one to accommodate your group.  Renting a pontoon boat would certainly be an option as Sinker suggested.  For a group that size if the lake is not that important, a couple of charter boats on Lake Ontario would be another alternative.  Might find one to take the whole group."
921485,aznphil,2015-06-24 17:28:00,73,"i'll take u guys out if you rent a pontoon from a cottage, i know a spot or two on rice."
921507,Garnet,2015-06-24 18:50:00,2056,Lets Fish Guiding John Sedgewick is in Cobourg good guy and Terry Courtice both been guiding Rice for years.
921512,Sinker,2015-06-24 19:40:00,8692,There's a good idea. I would do that as well....free of charge....as long as timing etc worked out for me.  I honestly don't think your going to find a guide on rice with a boat big enough for that many people.  S.
921528,Stoty,2015-06-24 21:13:00,2910,Terry Curtis for sure.

921648,FrankTheRabbit,2015-06-25 16:20:00,479,"I had the lucky opportunity from Will (Curtis Point) who took our group out on their pontoon. Comfortably fit 6 guys and could easily have accommodated two more.  And the pontoon boat they had wasn't one of those slow-poke ones, this one had some legs  It was a fun time had by all and the fishing wasn't bad either."
921716,Fishwilly,2015-06-25 22:25:00,206,Try Taro Murata. He's done a few shows with Bob Izumi and great guy to fish with. We fished with him this year and did real well.
