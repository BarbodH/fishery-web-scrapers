921117,fishindevil,2015-06-22 20:43:00,6254,I see so many near misses every year living on the kawarthas as well as fishing them it's unreal what I have seen ......and boats are bigger & faster than ever !!! We have way too many offshore 100mph boats on the kawarthas there will be a big bad accident sooner or later     Glad there was no fatalities on simcoe !!!!
