921037,bow slayer,2015-06-22 14:27:00,1074,"might be a bit out of the way but you can gets flats at Trans Can bait in Lavigne,Its about less than 30 minutes up 64 from Noelville."
921049,Fang,2015-06-22 15:02:00,1330,Here's a couple to check. It would all depend on timing coming through Ontario. I'll assume your crossing at Buffalo. These are really close to main Hwy you'll be on With all best to call ahead and order one in  I used to bulk several flats at a time right from this wholesaler. only open Mon-Fri business hours but I think they still will sell 1 flat to walk in customers - cash and you have to make an appointment for pick up National Bait Inc 946 Lakeshore Rd E Mississauga ON 905-278-0180   Fishing World QEW going into Hamilton 2411 Barton E  Bronte Outdoors ( I get mine from here now - They sell flats and by 100's) QEW in MIssissauga (you'll have to bypass 403 and take QEW to 427 to get to 400 highway) On 400 north just outside Toronto at the Bass Pro Mall
921061,BillM,2015-06-22 15:35:00,17367,"The Bait bucket is about 5 mins off the highway, give him a ring I'm sure he could help you out.  I wouldn't give a cent to the guy at the OnRoute past Teston Road."
921066,wvmedic,2015-06-22 15:58:00,144,"Thanks everyone, yes I  will be crossing at Buffalo. Sorry I didn't say that when I first posted.  I will call the places posted when I get home.  I changed plans yesterday, was going to Kipawa but Momma doesn't want to be that far in the bush"
921073,wantabigone,2015-06-22 16:30:00,97,You can also try fishing depot. It is 2 minutes off of 401 west of 400. http://www.jbsfishingdepot.com/  The minimum flat they will sell is 500.  Enjoy your trip!
921080,Whopper,2015-06-22 17:04:00,2174,Good Luck Jeff!
921082,wvmedic,2015-06-22 17:24:00,144,"Thank you Whopper, I might sneak over to Nipissing for a day since we will be that close."
921088,adempsey,2015-06-22 17:57:00,1498,"There's also Pagonis Live Bait.  They are wholesalers as well, but I think they will refer you to a relative that owns a shop near by.   Wherever you go, make sure to pre-order your flat.    I forgot one year and managed to get a flat, but half of the worms turned out to be dead.    It was also really gross going through the flat to recover the ones still alive!!!"
921104,Oggie,2015-06-22 19:39:00,588,Just curious and sorry for the side-step but how many worms in a flat and how much does a flat cost? Dan O.
921110,wvmedic,2015-06-22 19:55:00,144,"Oggie, no problem.  500 nightcrawlers per flat, I've so far been quoted from 60 to 100 dollars for a flat.  I did just get off the phone with the lodge owner, he gets his bait in on Thursday's from Trans Can bait in Lavigne. So he is going to get me a price of a flat for me, so he can have it there when we get there.  I called them direct and the nice lady on the phone quoted me 75 dollars with tax and a 2 dollar deposit on the flat it is approximately $86.50.  Jeff"
