921550,bare foot wader,2015-06-24 23:59:00,1354,"ah, the miracle of social justice lol...BC has clearly worded legislation about harassing wildlife (so does ON), but in some provinces this would not be an offence....at least facebook is good for something actually productive now (stupid people just can't seem to learn to not post their stuff online)  chasing and circling a moose with a jetboat in a lake, and jumping on it, is entirely different from a rodeo horse...stress to a wild animal is more severe than stress to livestock, in a province where moose numbers are dwindling in 2/3 of the management zones (although the Tuchodi is still abundant, but it gets guys pissed off to see crap like this going on)....when the original facebook feed got taken down it was a resident hunter who saved the videos off youtube and alerted the CO's, at least the media isn't spinning this to be negative light on hunters  personally hoping the boat operator and moose cowboy get steep fines and boat impounded till fines are paid"
921554,Gallie,2015-06-25 00:17:00,1215,"I feel that the difference between this and fishing may seem small but there is some reasoning to it.  Fishing has been around since man himself as a necessary food source, now over the years people came up with the idea of catching and releasing fish to sustain the population and sport fishing was born. Whether or not catching and releasing fish is morally right is up to the angler to decide for himself or herself, as i get older i myself have struggled with this question. I never like to see an animal of any kind harrased or stressed for no reason yet ive been fishing since i was old enough to hold a rod. I understand now they dont feel pain like we do but its stressful for sure.  my point being fishing is so ingrained into our culture that moral questions are usually not thought of very often.  This is different to me because it has no place in our culture, it is the unnecessary harassment of an animal for the sheer purpose of being an idiot for a laugh. To me it is the mockery of this animal that pisses me off! When i fish i try to respect the animal the best i can. No respect was shown here whatsoever  Im not here to judge or point fingers, i just wanted to share my views."

Trying to justify this inane act of stupidity or find some logical reason the duffus did it just is a waste of time and energy. Many dough heads do something stupid legal or illegal and video tape it, then they post it on some site for all to see. From jumping on the back of a wild animal to photographing or taping themselves having sex with their girlfriends and their wives find it, or vice versa. The Crown just loves these self incriminating knuckle heads, it sure makes their jobs easy. It happens everyday now. Their parents must be proud, wait some of these rocket scientists are parents, the kids must be proud. Like I said before just because something is legal does not make it right. And as it turns out this was illegal. I'm going to let it rest, not worth my time anylonger."

Everyone of us has abused or harassed wild creatures in some way.To me this moose video is no worse then anyone of us who have captured frogs, toads, turtles, birds or anything wild just for the experience or to take it home to show people. Hell I  take a white bucket with me when the grandkids come fishing with Grandpa and encourage them to put creatures in it to study and enjoy. And I'm pretty sure none of them critters wanted to be in that bucket.  I guess I best not put any white bucket nature shots on You tube.  Just trying to figure out how one form of ""Nature Abuse"" or harassment is deemed totally excusable  while other forms get black balled right out of the gate.

Not from the standpoint of the creature being harassed. Pretty sure both the frog and the moose would just as soon NOT be bothered by us in any way. And in neither example does the creature have a choice. So if the creature has no choice how is it that some creatures get defended for wrongful treatment... rather vigorously I might add... and others no one really cares about at all. I just find it amusing that a Moose being ridden has generated so much attention and I wanted someone to explain why it bothered them so much. If this was something that happened everyday and the Moose where shown to be suffering from repeated harassment I could understand the outrage. But a one off incident  that might not happen again for ages I just don't get the outrage."

921318,crappieperchhunter,2015-06-23 20:57:00,2582,On a fly in out of Chapleau in the 80's we had a cow moose swim across the mouth of the bay our cabin was in while we where eating our breakfast. She was a good mile from the closest shore when we figured out what she was. Jumped in our 2 tinnies and headed out with our camera's to get some pictures. We ALL wanted to jump on her back for a picture...and it would have been dead easy to do...but being on a fly-in we all decided if something bad happened we would be in a heap of trouble if something went wrong.  Honestly they are probably stronger then horses and we have been riding them for centuries. None of us would ever hurt an animal...we just viewed it as a once in a life time opportunity to do something not many people would get a shot at. Pretty sure these lads felt the same way...though there situation looks a lot more dangerous to them and the moose then the scenario we had.  We circled around her for awhile got lots of great pictures and then just left her alone before she got tired. Well we didn't have to worry about her getting tired. Instead of swimming to the closest shore she swam 2 maybe 3 miles to the end of a long point before she got out of the water.  Pretty sure after the experience we had that someone jumping on her back for a 10 second photo op would have caused no problems at all. Still wish to this day one of us would have given it a go.  Sorry folks but I think anybody who sets a hook into a fishes mouth and then fights it only to release it is far crueler to a defenceless creature then these lads...and that statement is coming from a fisherman who releases the majority of the fish he catches.

ALSO ,CARE IS GIVEN TO THE HORSES AND THE BULLS THEY RIDE in rodeos. What was done here, there was no care. Just something to make a video of a    move.  This guy jumped on from the bow of a boat. Full impact of his wieght. I might be wrong his fat,,,,,,,,,, might not of broke it,s back, but it,s still wrong. Like said. JMO."

They had a bigger more powerful boat and he jumped on an animal that was still walking on the bottom which would have had more of a jarring impact on the moose. We where circling a moose in 20 FOW and just crawling along to keep up with her.  Having said that I still don't think they could have hurt her by jumping on her back unless one of them weighed much much more then that guy does."
