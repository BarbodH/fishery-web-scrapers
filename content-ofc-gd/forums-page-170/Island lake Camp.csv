Gord was very professional and after we settled in, took the guys out for a tour of the lake. The cottages were very clean and everything was in order. The screened porches were a real hit. The camp assistant was a young lad named Ben. All I can say about this young adult was he was one of the best workers / friendly, obliging individuals I have ever met. If all people had the ethics this guy did the world would be a much better place. The fishing was decent with all the walleye and pike taken within the first few days. The weather that came through seemed to slow things down. The lakes very accommodating, easy to get around, controlled by dams. Its not a big lake but great for a few days of r&R. Would be great spot to take the wife. Our crew as always had a fantastic trip, thats it till the next trip. Thanks, Moo Cow "
