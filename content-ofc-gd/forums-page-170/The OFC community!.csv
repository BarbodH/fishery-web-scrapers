I think it is wonderful that we have a community that has such a diverse range of knowledge and is willing to share it?  No matter what the question or who asks it there is always a wealth of replies and information. OK, sometimes not quite what we wanted or expected LOL.  It never ceases to amaze me that the level of knowledge, experience, humor, (and good intentions) are quick to come into play when responding to any quiry and it makes me proud to be a part of something so special. OFC should be a way of life for everyone! IMHO!"

Great outdoorsman, great cooks, great parents(in no particular order)  But I was blown away when I struggled with addictions how many messages and phone calls and txts I got.  That meant the world to me, and my family.  Its amazing how far OFC goes to help the resource, friends etc.  Im heading to the hammer soon and i hope to meet some OFC'ers for sure.  Miigwich"

I sure have enjoyed it and met some fantastic folks here. There are not many trollers here, I think that's what you call sh&^ disturbers or people that act like spoiled brats. Civil discussions that can get heated but that's what people do when passionate about something. I was told this is either one of or has the largest membership of any fishing forums that exist.  The mods do a fantastic stellar job and they don't get much credit. A great forum is one where you don't even know there is a moderator there. Unlike some cluster jams where all the mods do is interrupt and Lock, lock, lock.  Thanks to TJ and his crew."
