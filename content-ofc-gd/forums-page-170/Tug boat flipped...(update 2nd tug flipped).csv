Nobody was hurt but I guess there's a bunch of deisel in the river now...  This is in Cornwall Ontario on the St. Lawrence river...  This is part of the rediculous performance of the crew tearing down the old international bridge...  Edit: the people responsible for the tear down have cables running all over the river... They attempted to mark them but the markers were pulled under by current as well... Now there are submerged cables and submerged marker bouys... And a capsized tug...
