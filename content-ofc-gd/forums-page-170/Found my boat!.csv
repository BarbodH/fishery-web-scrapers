921584,hirk,2015-06-25 02:37:00,571,"Congrats Albert, excellent looking rig!"
921585,HTHM,2015-06-25 02:45:00,4082,"super sweet, does it have the full stand up top ?  I don't know yet. I haven't opened it up yet, but based on  the rods I see I would have to say no. Besides, I don't think they can make ME a STAND UP top. I'm bigger than your average bear.  Congrats Albert, excellent looking rig!  Not an Ally, but SWMBO said I had to get an ""Opa"" boat. Suitable for grandkids. *sigh*"
921587,manitoubass2,2015-06-25 03:32:00,11391,"Lol, was it oma?"
921589,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-25 03:54:00,8243,"I don't get your last comment. Too many acronyms for me, English please. I understands the ""Opa"". But the rest, Greek to a mere mortal older guy.  As for transom savers pros and cons. I can swap out a lower unit in a few hours myself but wouldn't know where to start to repair a transom. I'll stick to using mine, especially with the added weight of a kicker. I have read that major damage can be done if the winch strap breaks suddenly or slack gets tightened up and all the weight of the rig is transferred to the bottom end. Yes that can happen. I recently saw a tip from Charlie Wray where he put a second clip from the chain to the bow cleat so the chain will not move a mm if the strap lets go. 3 bucks latter I have done the same thing."
921594,irishfield,2015-06-25 05:07:00,26272,She whom must be obeyed! SWMBO
921595,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-25 05:21:00,8243,Thank you. It must be tough for some to type a complete word. Yes I am a dinosaur. LOL ROTFLMAO. Oh my.

921446,cram,2015-06-24 15:35:00,1733,Beauty.  Looks like a nice boat. Galvanized trailer too?  That's a bonus.
921448,HTHM,2015-06-24 15:37:00,4082,Aluminum - even better!
921450,manitoubass2,2015-06-24 15:43:00,11391,How much if you dont mind me asking?  Thats a sweet boat man
921457,fishindevil,2015-06-24 16:00:00,6254,"great well built,solid boat !!!!! powered very nicely too !!!! woo hoo....."
921460,Walleye72,2015-06-24 16:12:00,156,Awesome find HTHM.  You're going to enjoy it.
921462,fishnsled,2015-06-24 16:13:00,3520,Great ride!  Congrats!
921464,leaf4,2015-06-24 16:17:00,2466,"Nice boat, would like one just like that for myself one day"
921465,scugpg,2015-06-24 16:18:00,1373,Congrats. He is a great guy and have had nothing but good dealings at bay city.
921468,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-24 16:34:00,8243,"Sweet albert, very nice. You know I have a 115 and 15 Mariner identical to your Mariners. You will be very happy with them. There is a very good chance your 90 was built by Yamaha exclusively for Mercury and still do for the overseas market from Asia to Africa."
921469,kickingfrog,2015-06-24 16:39:00,8333,Nice to have that taken care of. Buying used is great but it does take a lot more searching.
921477,BillM,2015-06-24 17:08:00,17367,That thing is mint for it's age!  Great pick up!
921480,Sinker,2015-06-24 17:19:00,8692,Nice rig!! Way better than the pontypool boat you were looking at!! Nice score!  S.
921482,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-24 17:24:00,8243,"Albert someone may know better but Featherstone Ted just stopped by and I showed him your new baby. He said that Smokercraft uses a StarCraft hull. It sure looks familiar to me without looking under it.  I don't see a transom saver, maybe it's just not on for the pic. Nothing to add on now, highly recommended especially with the kicker added to the transom."
921490,bow slayer,2015-06-24 17:48:00,1074,yep smokercraft hull are made by starcraft as are sylvans.
921511,irishfield,2015-06-24 19:19:00,26272,Looks like it pays off to go to church Albert!
921513,misfish,2015-06-24 19:46:00,29133,"Thats a sweet ride Albert and ya got a great power house. Those mariners are sweet.  What are you saying Wayne? Going to church will get me a new boat tooo? LOL Ok, I,ll try it a couple of times."
921519,mr blizzard,2015-06-24 20:27:00,1589,"HTHM Nice score , beautiful package, persistence pays off, you will have countless hours of pleasure out on the water."
921524,HTHM,2015-06-24 20:39:00,4082,"How much if you dont mind me asking?  Thats a sweet boat man  A fair price. One in which both the buyer and seller were happy with the resulting exchange.  Albert someone may know better but Featherstone Ted just stopped by and I showed him your new baby. He said that Smokercraft uses a StarCraft hull. It sure looks familiar to me without looking under it.  I don't see a transom saver, maybe it's just not on for the pic. Nothing to add on now, highly recommended especially with the kicker added to the transom.  Transom saver is inside and will be used faithfully.  Looks like it pays off to go to church Albert!  In more ways than one, Wayne."
921540,Mister G,2015-06-24 22:47:00,1429,"I picked up my new PolarKraft 179 Frontier with a 90 hp ETech on May 30th and told my dealer I wanted a transom saver......he response was ""I hate them things because they transfer every bump on the road into the lower unit. And he's a ace outboard mechanic that OWNS the marina for over 30 years that I purchased my rig. Needless to say I don't use a lower unit damage controller on my new rig."
921547,BillM,2015-06-24 23:33:00,17367,I wonder how many lower units have been replaced because of transom savers?  lolz.
921549,Fisherman,2015-06-24 23:50:00,7201,"I wonder how many lower units have been replaced because of transom savers?  lolz. X2,  If everything's not tight and things flop around,  it may impart a miniscule amount of shock to the lower leg.  I'll take my chances with the transom saver."
921578,Sinker,2015-06-25 01:55:00,8692,"Ive never used one on my '93 engine, and I trailer with the engine tilted up and locked. Transom hasnt budged in all those years, and many many miles. Just sayin..."
921583,woodenboater,2015-06-25 02:34:00,2277,"super sweet, does it have the full stand up top ?"
