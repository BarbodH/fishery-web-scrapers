Maybe someone can give it a try?? Published on Jun 1, 2015#TellThemNow Don’t hold back, tell your dad why you’re grateful.We asked ten fathers and their children to participate in a short video. That's all they were told. The result is powerful and surprised even the participants.We hope it will inspire you to pick up the phone and call your dad. Tell him why you’re grateful; tell him why you’re proud. He might just do the same. So much in life goes unsaid. Vulnerability and gratitude can crack us open in the best of ways.Tell us…why are you grateful to your dad? @echostories.com #TellThemNowSince 1999, Echo has been crafting inspiring stories for companies who need to engage employees and customers, and for individuals who want to leave a legacy.Find out more about the making of the #TellThemNow video at http://www.echostories.com/TellThemNowFind out more about Echo Storytelling Agency at http://www.echostories.comFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/EchoStorytell...Twitter - http://twitter.com/EchoStoriesSoundtrack “Still the Greatest” available on iTunes at https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/sti...Executive Producer: Samantha ReynoldsDirector: Pete McCormackDirector of Photography: Ian KerrEditor: Pete McCormackMusic: Pete McCormack/Schaun TozerCamera Operator: Chris MennellSound: Rylan KerbesAssistant/Online Editor: Josh PrattSound Editor: Jon RitchieProduction Manager: Carmen KerrProduction Assistant: Jane HopeProduction Assistant: Callum CarrMake-Up: Danielle Clark"
