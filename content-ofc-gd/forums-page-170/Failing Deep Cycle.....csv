921388,ecmilley,2015-06-24 02:07:00,2163,Lots of praise for costcos kirkland batterys out there. Know lots of peoplento have used them with low failure rates. I use east penn batteries die hard deka power surge among the names there branded as. Still runnin the 27's i put in in 2008 and still runnin all day thougj i am expecting a failure anytime top em up every spring and keep them charged. Best advice for buying a battery is convieance pick rhe brand/store your near the most if it does fail mo need to miles out of your way
921394,Raf,2015-06-24 02:59:00,3495,"if the 31s dont fit, the 29 series from walmart might be a good compromise if you want more reserve than the 27s.  i'm on year 3 on my wally world 29 and no complaints.  they are johnson control batteries."
921424,Sinker,2015-06-24 14:03:00,8692,The kirklands at costco are also johnson controls.  S.
921053,lookinforwalleye,2015-06-22 15:19:00,4399,"I think this has been covered before and I think I know the answer....but here it goes.  I have/use 2 deep cycle batteries on my 18 foot Stratos yesterday both batteries showed fully charged but neither worked very well, you had to have the motor on 5 to get it move at all and then it was like it was on setting 2.  They are 8 and 5 years old and I was never one to charge after every use so I think they may be done.  "
921055,Fisherman,2015-06-22 15:22:00,7201,"Take them out, charge them, then let them sit idle for 24 hrs(no charger, nothing attached)  and have them load tested.  Batteries can show a full charge upwards of 13.2-13.5 volts but don't have the current to back it up.  I had one truck battery this past winter that showed 12.8 volts,  only 50 amp on a load test that should have been around 800."
921060,kickingfrog,2015-06-22 15:34:00,8333,Another thing to take a quick look at.  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=78631&hl=%2Btrolling%2C+%2Bmotor
921062,BillM,2015-06-22 15:39:00,17367,"I gotta take a look at my Terrova foot pedal, it's doing some weird things."
921064,grimsbylander,2015-06-22 15:47:00,3016,Make sure they're topped up with distiller water(preferably)before you put them on the charger. Low fluid in a battery seems to charge well but loses power extremely quick.
921068,Roy,2015-06-22 16:10:00,13728,Have you taken the prop off lately?
921071,lookinforwalleye,2015-06-22 16:27:00,4399,Have you taken the prop off lately?   ....yes Roy I am not much of a fix-it guy but I do managed to take the prop off and pull the weed and line off and did get the prop back on properly from time to time...but trying to take the foot control apart and put it back together again scares me a bit.....
921075,fish_fishburn,2015-06-22 16:35:00,1311,If there low on fluid charge first the fill to proper levels.
921100,Garnet,2015-06-22 19:26:00,2056,5 and 8 years if the water is low they are on the why out. You can load test but 5 and 8 years old. Out with old in with new.
921101,aplumma,2015-06-22 19:28:00,6896,Consider them retired and get a set of new batteries and enjoy the worry free power.   Art
921119,esoxansteel,2015-06-22 20:45:00,1307,"8 and 5 years old is a bit of a difference in the batteries age, and the number of times each has been cycled or charged, I try to keep my batteries the same age or within a year of each, as recommended by a battery guy, could be a dead cell in one of the batteries, with 24 volts, ive gone 8 years with each battery providing they are the same age, and they are maintained and charged after each trip with an onboard charger charging each battery at the same time with the same"
921126,wallyboss,2015-06-22 21:36:00,1095,"If the batteries are being used at the same time either in series (for 24v)  or in parallel (for 12volts) the 2 batteries should be as identical (year/ size) as possible.  If they are used separately then it doesn't matter, but at 8 years old that battery is probably dead."
921136,Sinker,2015-06-22 23:55:00,8692,"I wish I could get 8 years out of a battery!! Even 5 years would make me happy. I just fish too much for batteries to last that long, and yes, I charge them every time with a smart charger, and keep the water level where it should be.  I get 3 yrs out of mine and im doing good.  S."
921140,ecmilley,2015-06-23 00:09:00,2163,"easy way to check is put a meter on the battery then turn on the trolling motor see what the voltage drops to, the bad on will hit 10vts or less almost immediatly. also if its a minn kota could be a armature/brush brush plate issue as well as a footpedal issue."
921155,irishfield,2015-06-23 00:54:00,26272,"Those suggesting topping the battery and then charging, do NOT do that!  If they are dead and the acid level is above the plates charge from there and IF needed, when almost fully charged, then top to the rings with distilled water. If the level is below plate tops then just add enough water to get the level above the plates, not to the rings.  If you top it first the acid will expand and overfill the battery."
921167,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-23 03:19:00,8243,"I tried to run a 6 year old deep cycle with a new one, does not work. I was told the same thing about battery age differential as liverealease mentioned.  When Irishfeild speaks I listen. I think it's important to have worthy batteries a few thousand feet above the ground, even a few hundred feet for that matter."
921173,irishfield,2015-06-23 05:06:00,26272,Don't need one at all when it comes right down to it.... itÂ just depends on who wants to get out on the float and give the prop a spin to restart!  
921175,fishindevil,2015-06-23 08:34:00,6254,Wow 5&8 yrs I'm like Shane if I get 4yrs from my batteries I'm doing well !!! Yes I maintain them have a smart charger as well but I use mine heavy with the trolling motor running it pretty much all summer long !!!! I have 2 29 series 12v marine deep cycle batteries run in parallel and they get put through the wringer for sure so I know it's just a fact if life that every 3-4 yrs I have to get new batteries !!!! But I'm never in a problem of battery failure so it's piece if mind too !!! And I usually always have 1 or 2 for spares if I am in a pinch !!!!
921183,Mister G,2015-06-23 11:04:00,1429,I am currently running a 5 year old battery that use to be my starting battery on my old boat (it's a dual purpose battery) and a 7 year old deep cycle battery for my 24 volt Minn Kota and it's working very well. I hope to get this year out of it and see what happens next season. Both batteries have ALWAYS been on charge whenever the boat is not in use via a on-board smart charger.  Do ecmilley's test on those batteries. Also run the TM with the charger hooked up to see if it's a battery problem or a TM problem.
921185,Garnet,2015-06-23 12:05:00,2056,"From the start  Your battery's went dead.  Load tester on each battery and note the volts.  Now plug in your charger, with in a few minutes the volts should go up 2-3 volts. Your charger is working. Note your battery's need to be in a discharge state to check charger.  Fully charge your battery's and now check with load tester. If the needle goes to ""bad"" they are bad. Why doesn't matter.  If you were testing your starting battery. You would start motor and the volts would go up. If they don't alternator, Stanner  .  As stated mixing different ages of battery's makes them operate at the weakest battery level.  If your battery's are lasting 8 years you need to fish more. When I was going hard 18 months max put was using my battery's 5-7 days a week."
921195,Lunker Larry,2015-06-23 13:08:00,122,Just retired my Big Red from Total Battery. Bought it in April 2004. Started to show its age last year. Didn't survive the winter. Great battery.  Weighs 69lbs.
921197,BillM,2015-06-23 13:12:00,17367,"So I measured the battery trays in the Lund, I should be able to get a pair of Group 31's up front for my Terrova.  Anyone running Group 31s from Costo?  I really like their return policy..."
921227,Sinker,2015-06-23 14:49:00,8692,I'm on my 3rd season with a pair of them Bill. No issues. They have tons of power.  S.

921288,Garnet,2015-06-23 18:37:00,2056,Cosco is a 845 cranking Group 27. I got 4 years from my last set fishing 3-4 times a week.
