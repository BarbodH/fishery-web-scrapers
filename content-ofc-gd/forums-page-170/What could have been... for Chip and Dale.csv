Next thing we know there was another one on the other side barking back. The first one starts moving side to side right at the shore the way a dog does right before it jumps in and sure enough, splash off it goes towards the other shore. My brother gets out his camera and films the second half of the swim.  Commentary provided by my brother:   Just after this guy gets to the shore the second chipmunk jumps in and swims to the other side and then the first one swims back to his original side. We were really hoping for a musky to make an appearance but it wasn't to be.  As for the fishing, it was slow.     But even after a day on the water he was still fishing while we loaded up to go home.  "
