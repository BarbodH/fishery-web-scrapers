921479,John Bacon,2015-06-24 17:18:00,3277,"I have never used one myself.  The only one that I have ever was in the $3,500 price range... a little out my snack bracket."
921486,dave524,2015-06-24 17:35:00,4508,"I remember half bails being widely available in the 50's. Luxor, Mitchell, Ambidex and Airex ( made by the Lionel Model Train Company) all had 1/2 bail models. Actually my 1st spinning reels was an Airex Spinster followed by an Ambidex No.4 , both had full bails though. Think you could convert the No.4 to a half bail."

921493,manitoubass2,2015-06-24 17:57:00,11391,My mind is blown  How does that work?
921494,manitoubass2,2015-06-24 17:58:00,11391,Is it like a baitfeeder with a switch on the back?
921506,Garnet,2015-06-24 18:47:00,2056,Use to cut the bail arm off Cardinal 3 for speck fishing. You had to turn handle to get bail to flip over with a big clunk. Every speck for 3 county's would be gone.
921510,dave524,2015-06-24 19:15:00,4508,My mind is blown  How does that work?  You just manually put the line under roller on the stub of the bail arm.

I have never used it. I just like looking at it. It,s a pretty heavy little reel. Stainless with brass and some kind of stone for a reel handle. Might be marble. The drag is a felt washer.  I,ll try to post it later."
921526,OhioFisherman,2015-06-24 20:59:00,6623,"http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Abu-507-Closed-Face-Reel-With-Original-Paperwork-/171834130533?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_3&hash=item28021cc065  I used these pretty extensively, 17-20# test and you can flip or pitch an unweighted plastic worm or 1/8 ounce lure well. No line twist or tangles and great for fishing at night in the dark. The black ring on the front of the reel face is the line release, you just catch the line with your finger and go."
