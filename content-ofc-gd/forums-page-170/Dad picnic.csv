Ran out some lines just in case the fish were biting. Had a bucket fight with the 2 pre-school aged grandkids. The son-in-law was the only one to catch a fish. Despite being a new dad, father's day, and all that, we had to revoke Andrew's man card. Apparently he won't take the hook off or touch the fish. That boy needs some working on methinks."

A resort with pool outdoor gazebo with a wood burning oven, full kitchen and everything else; lots of food and just relaxing with the eight grandkids and other family members. With four daughter's they never liked the rough stuff. At least I didn't have to cook. happy nonno's day Bruce. I took a picture of my latest one with her father, grandfather (I was also in it) and great grandfather.Hope she will keep it when we are gone. Pics are too big to post."
