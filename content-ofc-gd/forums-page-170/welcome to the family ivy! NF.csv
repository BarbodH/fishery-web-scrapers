920782,manitoubass2,2015-06-20 02:47:00,11391,"Picked up our new girl today? siberian husky.  One year old and full of pep!  Gorgeous dog!!!  Fishing adventure tomorrow! Her first time out, should be interesting?  "
920783,Gallie,2015-06-20 02:51:00,1215,Cool dog man
920784,manitoubass2,2015-06-20 03:01:00,11391,Thanks!  Boy is she hyper!
920787,leaf4,2015-06-20 03:15:00,2466,Nice pup! huskies can be a handful if they're as vocal as my girlfriends (also a female) she's not so hyper anymore but sure knows how to get everyone's attention until she gets what she wants lol
920788,Reel Man,2015-06-20 03:30:00,80,She's a beauty!  And a welcome addition to the family I'm sure!  Enjoy
920789,manitoubass2,2015-06-20 03:39:00,11391,She hasnt barked once.  Shes got sooo much to take in though.  I thought shed be real anxious but shes not.  I introduced her to the other huskies and no issues.  Now the cats on the otherhand???  The previous owners had her sleep in a kennel. Well she hates that thing. And she also doesnt know her name? I dont think she got too much attention?
920798,Big Cliff,2015-06-20 11:58:00,6899,"Sounds like the perfect dog! She is going to love attention and will do everything in her power to please you so she gets it!Loads of praise and affection every time she does what you ask of her. If you have a kennel for her, leave the door open and don't let anyone bother her if/when she goes in it. That will become her safe place."
920805,Rod Caster,2015-06-20 13:00:00,5784,That would be a perfect companion to my Husky Buddy. Cute as hell she is.
920810,manitoubass2,2015-06-20 13:24:00,11391,We left the kennel open last night and she never touched it once.  She slept with my daughter till about 4am then she woke up for a pee. Then she decided to lay on my bed for the rest of the night lol  Pretty good first night. Too be honest I expected a long night.
920812,manitoubass2,2015-06-20 13:54:00,11391,"She seems to be warmup up nice to the other pups. Gonna take some time though. No fighting so thats good  Just sniffing each other out and a little playing.  She must be a little stressed with the move because she hasnt eaten yet, i hope that dont last long."
920816,Walleye72,2015-06-20 14:42:00,156,She's a real beauty.  How many dogs do you have?
920817,manitoubass2,2015-06-20 14:47:00,11391,
920818,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-20 14:59:00,8243,"Another mouth to feed young fella. What's that make now about 12 then when Mom gets into town 13? Good on you, and that Pup is a beauty. Hurry up and get down here, you  need a break."
920819,manitoubass2,2015-06-20 15:04:00,11391,"I wouldnt have it any other way!  But yes, a few breaks per year is nice! Cant wait to come visit you sir???  That will be a great time no doubt!"
920822,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-20 15:11:00,8243,There's a pile of Gnocchi waiting for you at a real deal Italian restaurant in downtown Hamilton. Check the Ti Cat schedule there might be a game when you are here I might be able to get a few favours paid back and score some tickets.
920825,manitoubass2,2015-06-20 15:20:00,11391,Sounds great to me!  Id like to get in some fishing and maybe a round of golf too.  Maybe a few others in the area from OFC can have a lil meet n greet?
920854,manitoubass2,2015-06-20 18:35:00,11391,"Well Ivy found ""Her spot"".  On top the couch looking out the window lol  Shes already walked me 6km today. Hoofta.  Still wont eat though  Did her weight(24lbs, def under weight)  Took her measurements, 2 ft to the shoulder.  Shes probably as tall as shes gonna get now. But shes got alot of filling in to do.  Still blows my mind she doesnt know her name??? Weird  "
920857,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-20 19:14:00,8243,"M2B2, get me the dates again you will be in town. We can start a thread and set up a OFC GTG in Hamilton. Maybe a mini golf tourney. You can't swing a cat with out hitting some very nice courses in the Niagara peninsula. Kings Forest Golf Course right in the Hammer was once ranked as one of  the top 5 Muni courses in Canada. It is down the street from where I grew up. It has been used as one of the courses for qualification for the Canadian Open. The Walleye should be in on Erie in August as well. Nothing like Rainy River pics. I throw the small ones back, they are only 7 pounders. Actually I will take a 5 pounder over a 12 for eaters. But I have never turned my nose up on any Walleye from Erie. The 10 pounders are only a few years old if I recall correctly.  Can't wait to take your money fishing or golfing. I get a stroke for every year I'm older than you and am never too proud to hit from the ladies T's!!!!!  Fins and Skins North vs. South, I love it.  Can't wait.  Johnny D"
920868,BillM,2015-06-20 21:46:00,17367,Awesome dog man!
920888,Burtess,2015-06-21 01:35:00,901,"My middle kid loves Huskies and she thinks Ivy is the bomb!!  And I love those eyes!  Enjoy, Burt"
920889,manitoubass2,2015-06-21 01:44:00,11391,Thanks Bill!
920890,manitoubass2,2015-06-21 01:45:00,11391, Thats awesome your kiddo like huskies! Great breed for sure!  Cant wait to see your new boxer!
920907,bigugli,2015-06-21 10:55:00,6138,Nice looking dog.  You love them and they'll love you back unconditionally.
921009,manitoubass2,2015-06-22 03:27:00,11391,For sure Bruce!  Ivy is loving all the attention and activities.  I thought it would be a long first week but shes fit right in! Already mingling with the other dogs and just havin fun?  She dint like to be left alone though thats for sure. She just howls away.  Shes eating good and no issues doing her outside business now.  What an awesome pup!!!
921276,manitoubass2,2015-06-23 17:13:00,11391,"Hahahaha. I moved the kennel into the doorway to block her from the kitchen.  Ivy laughs and says ""try again""  ?  "
