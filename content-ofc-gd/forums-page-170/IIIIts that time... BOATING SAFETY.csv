As a reminder here is my story 2 years ago:  just want to share my experience to everyone here, while summer is in full swing and everyone is out enjoying the lake.  PLEASE be ATTENTIVE and SAFE when on the water.  Yesterday while out on a Kawartha lake 3 of us rented a 14ft boat and were fishing outside the channel, some 200m away from the channel marker.  We were stationary, motor off, standing up fishing.  At the last second my friend, who was on the bow, spotted a 18ft Bayliner speeding at 45km/h in a direct collision course to our stern, where I was.  We were jumping and waving and at the last second I realized he wasn't stopping so I jumped.  When I surfaced there was chaos as the bow of their boat breached up on to our stern, sinking our boat.  We bailed and towed the boat back and that's when I saw how their bow dented the INSIDE of our boat, and their hull which destroyed the bench where I was sitting.  We escaped with minor injuries.  If there was ever a miracle this is it.  I'm going to be the advocate every year around this time..lol"

920714,Walleye72,2015-06-19 16:38:00,156,Sheesh!  What did the Bayliner operator have to say?  Was he looking back the whole time?
920720,Headhunter,2015-06-19 17:00:00,5703,"I bet the Bayliner didn't see you guys because his bow was sticking up in the air and he was not being very attentive to his situation. Glad everyone was ok, but if he had hit me, Bayliner boy would be getting someone else to chew his food for a while! HH"

920744,captpierre,2015-06-19 21:05:00,2521,Crazy! I know a husband and wife that were trolling in a tinny and were run over by a ski boat. The wife in the front reading a book had to me medivaced by heli to Sunnybrook with multiple  fractures. Beware out there.
920746,hunteronwheels,2015-06-19 21:31:00,112,speaking of boat safety can any one point me in the direction of a life jacket i dont want a pfd i want the type that turns you over onto your back i fish all the time by myself and want the safety
920850,Sinker,2015-06-20 17:45:00,8692,That's crazy. Glad you were all OK. What did the bayliner guy have to say?  A buddy of mine had the same thing happen last year on rice lake. The operator had a cooler full of beer in the boat. My buddy took a cash settlement to replace/repair his little tin can. I would have hammered the guy in the other boat with every law there is. That's just not right!!!  Thank god nobody was hurt!!!  S.
