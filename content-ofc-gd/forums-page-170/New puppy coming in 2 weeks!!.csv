Well we very quickly realized that we needed a canine companion in our house, and that it felt so empty without one.  We were lucky to find a very well respected Boxer breeder close to us, and had a visit and got on a waiting list for a puppy.  The wait is nearly over! In two weeks we will bring the little bugger home. We picked on Thursday....    Here is a close up of him...   And here he is playing with one of his littermates...   The mad rush to finish puppy proofing the house is on!!  Burt"
