918666,fish_fishburn,2015-06-05 15:19:00,1311,"Keep using sunscreen, that will give you skin cancer. Best to cover up when in the sun for long periods of time."

919271,Steve,2015-06-09 22:27:00,2075,"so I got my 12 in today.  they are much thinner than the two I already own.  I hope they keep the sun out! Website shows SPF 40....  They certainly will be cooler than the two I currently own....I weighed them compared to the two I own and they are 40% lighter....  Guess that is a good thing, but can also be a bad thing.  Not sure how they'll work out....but for $5 bucks per, if I don't like them, I'll sell them and make my money back.  couldn't imagine paying full price for this specific brand however. too thin!!!"
919282,Terry,2015-06-09 23:07:00,14456,got mine  thin  I think that is a cool thing
919286,Steve,2015-06-09 23:28:00,2075,"if it still stops the sun, then its GREAT for summer (less for keeping warm in cooler temps).  however, they are thin enough that I hope they keep the rays out.  we'll see soon enough. Bass opener in 11 days  :)"

919385,grimsbylander,2015-06-10 16:26:00,3016,Got mine and they look good. If they were thicker I probably wouldn't wear them in the heat of the day when you actually need protection.
921139,Bondar,2015-06-22 23:59:00,817,"Hahahaha, ok who did it? http://m.kijiji.ca/fishing-camping-outdoor/kitchener-waterloo/facemasks/v?adId=1082120196&ck=CK&from=Search&ts=1435017417078"

921177,fishindevil,2015-06-23 08:47:00,6254,The buffs are great have been using them for a few years now !!! And they do work as well as my UV SHIRTS !!! saves the agony of a major sunburn ....there is some real cool designs out there now !!! Got mine at bass pro for $20 each and have stood up well to repeated washings
921282,fish_fishburn,2015-06-23 17:37:00,1311,Bunch of wussies.
921463,tip-up,2015-06-24 16:16:00,94,"Buff guy for life here now!!! Really reduces sun fatigue at the end of those scorching hot days. Have not tried them in the cold, I'll normally put a balaclava on those days."
921481,John Bacon,2015-06-24 17:21:00,3277,These type deals seem pretty common from this company.  I definitely wouldn't pay the listed price for these seeing as 75% or 80% off is pretty common.  I did order a set a few days ago.  Hopefully they will be here soon.
917603,Fisherman,2015-05-29 23:59:00,7201,you you don't just flip them inside out ? when dirty That's just for crunchy underwear.
917604,grimsbylander,2015-05-30 00:01:00,3016,Thanks for posting that...they're not always easy to find and usually $20+ for one!! My orders in too.
917609,Weeds,2015-05-30 00:12:00,782,Just the thought of wearing one makes me itch. I guess if it was a deep freeze or something. Are you guys wearing these just to avoid a few Rays?

They don't itch at all. Actually they are pretty comfortable. I wear them on those scorching cloudless days mostly. And when I'm down South. This is down in FLA during some smoking heat.  
917618,Steve,2015-05-30 00:50:00,2075,
917636,Lunkerhunter,2015-05-30 02:43:00,455,I placed my order as well. I use them during chilly mornings when driving the boat. Also throughout the fall to keep my face from getting too cold. They are also great when driving through lots of bugs. Keeps em out of your face haha  I find them a bit warm during the real hot days but I sweat my ass off During all types of weather. I will throw one on if I feel like I'm burning.
917637,solopaddler,2015-05-30 02:44:00,8605, They don't itch at all. Actually they are pretty comfortable. I wear them on those scorching cloudless days mostly. And when I'm down South.

917647,manitoubass2,2015-05-30 10:32:00,11391,"Im gonna have to get some. Too bad i missed out on the deal.  On hot days I actually bring a spare tshirt and soak it in water. The put my head through the hole and tie it with the sleeves.  Ive been asked a few times""are you muslim""?  ""Nope, this is just a t shirt!""  ???"
917655,grimsbylander,2015-05-30 13:10:00,3016,I just tried the promo code again and seemed to work. Hit the redeem button.
917669,Rod Caster,2015-05-30 15:12:00,5784,"Never used them, I laugh at the tough-guy bikers who wear them, but I ordered 5 to try hunting, fishing hot days, cold and ATV'ing in bug season. I might just like them. For $21, can't go wrong. CA80 still works.  I got the fishing and camo ones, and of course the mustache one. guaranteed to make some people laugh."
917686,wallyboss,2015-05-30 16:36:00,1095,During the hottest part of the day I usually wet down the buff and it sure feels good to wear it!

917700,Steve,2015-05-30 17:30:00,2075,agreed wallyboss.  I'm not a small dude and it sure helps keeping me cool in the hot sun.
917958,Moosebunk,2015-06-01 01:01:00,3970,"Can't bring myself to go quite that ""Metro sensitive"" with a buff yet.  But, we as men after our mid 30's do lose about 1% of our testosterone per annum.  Maybe the levels could reach low enough in time.  Ti'll then I'll roll the dice... because the sun does give us through our skin the best doses of one of the strongest anti-oxidants we can absorb.  Vitamin D doods.  Lots of block on for the ears and nose though, couple of higher percentage oma spots."
917968,manitoubass2,2015-06-01 02:22:00,11391,"Vitamin d is needed for cholesterol, cholesterol is needed for testosterone production.  Maybe your at .75 per year loss bunk???"
