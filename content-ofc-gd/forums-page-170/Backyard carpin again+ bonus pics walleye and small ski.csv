921365,manitoubass2,2015-06-23 23:34:00,11391,Nice!!!!!  That ski is a beaut!  Your face says it all when it comes to the carp?  Thanks for sharing
921416,Rod Caster,2015-06-24 12:16:00,5784,Greasy carp!  So what were you actually fishing for when you caught the walleye and musky?
921425,Gallie,2015-06-24 14:10:00,1215,"Walleye and muskie lol, just bonus pics from the weekend not bonus fish? To clarify a buddy of mine has a bit of property on a tiny lake that only holds stunted skis and some ok walters. Never actually tried for wallys there myself till this trip because the other two guys hadnt caught anything and were getting restless so we went through the boxes and dug out a couple jigs and started drifting. I caught 2 pics and a perch and they caught squat! Poor buggers."
