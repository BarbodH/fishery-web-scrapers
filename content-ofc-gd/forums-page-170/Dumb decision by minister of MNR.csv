921132,spincast,2015-06-22 23:11:00,3279, I wonder if any letters to the Minister have been initiated to let him know how crazy this is.  PS - Carp eat Atlantic Salmon eggs
921138,Woodsman,2015-06-22 23:57:00,1286,2 rods allowed from a boat anchored to the shore? Would a boat anchored to the shore meet the defination of open water? I don't think so. Anchored to the shore would be closed at least on one side.
921141,Fisherman,2015-06-23 00:16:00,7201,PS - Carp eat Atlantic Salmon eggs And you probably eat chicken eggs.  It's a 100% C&R so the P3TA freaks wouldn't have much to howl about.  Just a good tourism and fishing boost.
921145,ecmilley,2015-06-23 00:24:00,2163,Why cant they just use one rod? not like theres a shortage of carp to go around
921151,manitoubass2,2015-06-23 00:37:00,11391,"They could, but its like asking the stanley cup to be decided in one game."

921165,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-23 03:10:00,8243,The Provincial Liberals will be in power until The GTA is sold to the USA. The 51st State and it comes with a NHL team! OOps deal breaker.
921045,kickingfrog,2015-06-22 14:52:00,8333,"I'm with Gord on this.  http://www.outdoorcanada.ca/Cut_the_Carp   From Gord Pyzer:   Trust me, I am not making this up. The Ontario government, through the Minister of Natural Resources, has refused to host one of the biggest fishing events on Earth.  Turned thumbs down on an event that would have profiled to the rest of the world some of the province's most unbelievable natural resource-related tourism opportunities.  Given the bum's rush to a good news conservation story that would have been covered by more international media—television, radio, magazine and newspaper—than possibly any other fishing event in the world.  But the Minister has said, ""no thanks"" to the enormous social and economic benefits—that is much needed jobs and revenue—that would have accrued to the province and the country.If you're wondering what I am talking about, it is the 2017 World Carp Championships.  The organizers wanted to stage the 100-percent catch-and-release tournament in Lake Ontario around Toronto.  It would have been only the second time the event would have been held in North America and the first time ever in Canada.  But the Ontario Minister of Natural Resources has thumbed up his nose and scoffed at the international invitation.  Why, you wonder? Well, it is because the organizers requested a simple Minister's variation order that would have allowed the contestants from 102 teams from 27 countries from around the world to use two fishing rods for the few days of the tournament.  We're talking about a signature on a piece of paper for crying out loud.  But it gets even crazier.Are you ready for this: If the anglers were sitting in boats tied to shore, two rods would be legal because it's the standard on the Great Lakes where the event would have taken place.  But, if the anglers fish from shore, as is the custom in the World Championships, they would be deemed to be fishing illegally.  Hence, the request for the short term variation order, which I would hasten to point out, is designed precisely to give the Minister the discretionary power to accommodate this very type of thing and is used prolifically by his counterparts in other provinces.Think it can't get any sillier? You'd better sit down for this one.While carp are one of the most sought after game fish worldwide—in places like Britain, Europe, Scandinavia, China, Japan and even the United States—they enjoy a much less celebratory status in Canada.  As a result, there is no carp season in Ontario—it is open year round—and you can shoot them in many locations with a bow and arrow.  Matter of fact, you can kill as many giant carp as your heart desires, even when they're spawning, and at the end of the day drag home the carcasses to fertilize your rose bushes. Canadian carp pro, Len Perdic shows the level of sophistication that carp angler's have gone to in pursuit of their quarry Understand what I am saying?  The organizers wanted to profile to the rest of the world the amazing carp fishing that Ontario has to offer and in the process, educate Canadian anglers on the unbelievable angling opportunity for gigantic fish that they're failing to value and appreciate. They wanted to catch, handle carefully, quickly weigh and then safely release the very same fish they could legally shoot with bows and arrows.I know what you're thinking, but hold the thought, we're not finished yet.Against this potential social and economic windfall, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources is facing a massive fiscal shortfall.  Fisheries science projects are being shelved, staff are being laid off and conservation officers are being told not to drive their boats and vehicles in order save money on gas.  In an attempt to shore up its bank account, Premier Wynne has already indicated her intention to scrap the enormously popular conservation fishing licence, which was a godsend, forcing all anglers to purchase much more expensive full limit seasonal licenses.  It is nothing more than a cash grab, of course, but it will have oh, so serious resource repercussions.Cash strapped young adults and first time anglers, the very folks we want to get outdoors and engaged in the sport will now think twice about buying an expensive license, as will the husbands and wives of avid anglers who only occasionally accompany their partners.  But the bigger problem will be all the resident and non-resident anglers who start thinking that, since the province has done away with the half limit conservation license, there mustn't be any problem killing their limit every time they go fishing.  Heck, they'll even argue that they paid for it.Talk about sending the wrong message.Compare that to the fact that the World Carp Championship organizers wanted to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars hosting one of the biggest events of its kind and profile, free of charge, Ontario's splendid tourist opportunities to anglers around the world, who will potentially visit the province, stay in its motels, hotels, resorts, campgrounds, provincial parks and tourist establishments.  The visitors would frequent restaurants and dining rooms and do all the things international tourists do creating much needed social and economic benefits, creating jobs and filling the province's coffers.At the same time, the Championship would shine a bright light on an under-utilized and overlooked natural resource, which for the most part is being wasted today.  And in the process it would educate resident anglers about how to enjoy the fishery responsibly, sustainably and ethically.But, in order to do it, the Minister of Natural Resources would have to sign his name on a piece of paper which he is not prepared to do.Like I said, you couldn't make up this stuff if you tried."

921054,Fisherman,2015-06-22 15:19:00,7201,"Ministry of Numpties and Retards.  After hearing another story this weekend from up around the Spanish area,  their minimum pass percentage must be pretty feeble."
921057,Dusky,2015-06-22 15:27:00,310,What a waste of an opportunity. I wish we would be able to question these retarded politicians who are good for nothing.
921058,lookinforwalleye,2015-06-22 15:28:00,4399,"Well you are relying on a Liberal cabinet minister to make a informed rational decision....  ..... four more years and you all will have another chance to get rid of the criminals, until then......"
921063,Mike Pike,2015-06-22 15:43:00,1332,I've watched past World Carp Championships on Youtube and read accounts from famous British Carp anglers who have participated in them.  I'm blown away by the scope of the event and sorry that we won't be getting the event because of a Minister's poor lack of judgement.
921065,SmokestackLightnin,2015-06-22 15:55:00,390,You can bet the Minister's decision came after consulting the Ministry.   This is really dumb.
921069,wkrp,2015-06-22 16:10:00,656,Stupid is as Stupid does.
921074,fish_fishburn,2015-06-22 16:31:00,1311,Doesn't surprise me at all. I still haven't been able to find anyone who voted for the Liberals in the last election. So how did they get a majority govt? Must of took lessons from the fed govt.
921076,Gallie,2015-06-22 16:40:00,1215,Wow indeed
921078,cram,2015-06-22 16:49:00,1733,"Just playing devil's advocate....maybe they were worried about setting a precedent that would be expected for tournaments for other species?  (around changing the rules in general to accommodate tournaments, not that specific one).  As for the economic benefit...I'd bet it's not that much greater than a kid's hockey tournament.  I doubt this was going to be bringing bazillions of $ to Ontario."
921079,cram,2015-06-22 17:00:00,1733,Though maybe they already change the rules for tournaments for other species...i don't know much about it.
921087,jimmer,2015-06-22 17:53:00,2730,It's not even a game fish we're talking about. Silly Liberal Government.
921093,Thrilla,2015-06-22 18:20:00,164,The same government that decided to make the new ferry for Pelee island  in Chile instead of right here in Ontario LOL LOL
921094,John Bacon,2015-06-22 18:31:00,3277,"Though maybe they already change the rules for tournaments for other species...i don't know much about it.  They do.  Some of those have been permanent changes to the laws.  E.g. Laws have been changed to allow culling of bass, pike, and walleye in order to accommodate tournaments."
921098,Paudash,2015-06-22 19:19:00,273,"no surprise, we just keep voting them in"
921105,SmokestackLightnin,2015-06-22 19:42:00,390,"Don't get me wrong, I am not happy with the present provincial government.  However, the Minister likely made his decision based on input from Ministry staff.  There is a long list of concerns with the Ontario MNRF and this is just another brick in the wall."
921108,Broker,2015-06-22 19:49:00,482,Whatta shame. Would have been neat to see here
921116,fishindevil,2015-06-22 20:34:00,6254,Typical !!!! Only the clowns in charge could screw it up this bad to not see the economic benifits of this !!!! Unreal ..... If all the govt put their heads together they might make a rock pile !!!!
921122,manitoubass2,2015-06-22 20:57:00,11391,"Sadly this will probably be the last time they ask.  Lotsa people like carp fishing and im sure those people would have loved this idea. Too bad really on many different levels.  Im not in the area but I would have loved to watch it. Carpers are intense, its entertaining"
921123,manitoubass2,2015-06-22 21:05:00,11391,"Rob, is anyone against Gord?  Friggen guy is insanely knowledgeable about all things fishing and hes super good at presenting it in a friendly manner.  I met him at a seminar in Emo ontario years back and its was such a treat to hear his insights to angling and various species."
921124,misfish,2015-06-22 21:14:00,29133,"I,ll bet, it would of drawn more $$$$$$$$$$, then any big bass series here. We are talking about anglers from all around the world here. SAD.  Always liked watching the UK fishing tournys on tv."
921125,fishnsled,2015-06-22 21:30:00,3520,"Day in and day out this government never ceases to amazing me how incompetent they are. I'm still bashing my head over the last election.  Gord Pyzer for the next Minister of Natural Resources!  However,  too good of a guy to go down the path of politics."
921128,manitoubass2,2015-06-22 22:11:00,11391,I could only imagine if Gord filled that position!  Imagine the president of the MNR pulling up in a boat telling you the lakers are shallower then usual????
921129,Fisherman,2015-06-22 22:15:00,7201,I wonder if any letters to the Minister have been initiated to let him know how crazy this is.
