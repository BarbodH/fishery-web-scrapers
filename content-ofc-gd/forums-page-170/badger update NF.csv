920797,Big Cliff,2015-06-20 11:52:00,6899,"And it would be the last time if she was mine, I'd have backed her into a corner and taken it away from her! Don't ever let your dog become the alpha, she now thinks she can hold ground with you. Not good!"

920809,manitoubass2,2015-06-20 13:21:00,11391," Shes protective of her catch, thats fine with me!!!  And shes shown teeth at me before cliff. She quickly backs down when I approach. No doubt I could have grabbed the rest of the bones without a ruckus, if i chose to"
920859,Big Cliff,2015-06-20 19:32:00,6899,Only my opinion my friend and I sure don't know everything. I'm sure you have a handle on it!
