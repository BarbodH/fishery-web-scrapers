921644,NAW,2015-06-25 16:06:00,4022,"Hey folks.  I notice a few blue berries patches while camping last weekend.  Some of the berries where starting to turn a little red.  But most where still green, and very hard.  I'd really like to get out this year, and pick a few margarine containers full.  Enough for blue berry pancakes for the year!  I'm sure it varies a little each year.  But does anyone know when the usual wild blue berry picking season starts??  Or even better, does anyone have a good estimate of when and how long this season will be in Muskoka this year??  Any help is greatly appreciated!  "
