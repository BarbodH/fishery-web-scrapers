316237,ERB,2009-03-12 00:30:00,35,"I have some Low Vis Green line, Just wondering if anyone ever uses this colour for ice fishing?  Or should I go with clear? Thanks"
316248,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-12 00:44:00,3761,"If the water is clear go with a clear mono or fluorocarbon, if there is a slight discoloration in the water use the green lines. Also if you are fishing day time in a clear lake go with the clear line, if night then it does not matter as much.  I on the other hand use clear mono and braid...none of that expensive fluorocarbon crap"
316249,Raf,2009-03-12 00:46:00,3495,doesnt matter.  when ice fishn i just want to be able to see the line myself to watch for bumps etc.  people get waay to caught up in line colour imo.
316271,Leecher,2009-03-12 01:32:00,7832,I agree with what Raf said.... I use Power Pro Ice braid and the line is light blue.... caught lots of fish with it
316289,douG,2009-03-12 02:24:00,2693,"Black dacron is also a good idea for the ice fish thingy.  It catches fish, and certainly helps with the line management while you are battling a lumper."
316290,douG,2009-03-12 02:25:00,2693,"Sry, that should read 'Lunker'.  Hope this hleps."
316304,richyb,2009-03-12 02:55:00,774,"Ive got one jigging stick and tip up rigged up with a 6 foot flourocarbon leader on the end. I also have a tip up and a jigging stick that has 20lb cheap redwolf line and they all catch equal amounts of fish.  You will never know till you try, but i bet that will work just fine."
316326,EC1,2009-03-12 05:25:00,930,"when I use trilene, I ALWAYS stick with the lo-vis green. For some reason the clear stuff seems to have more memory and is harder.  Maybe the clear stuff I got was a bad batch, but now I have the most confidence with lo-vis green no matter when/where"
316329,Stoty,2009-03-12 05:42:00,2910,"I agree, too much thought goes into line colour. Colour doesn't seem to matter much.  On my baitcasters, I use Power Pro in the high-vis red, and on my spinning its green or clear Rapala line."
316397,Zubris21,2009-03-12 14:22:00,563,"Can't say I've changed line colour much with ice fishing, but in the summer while bottom bouncing for walleye on the St. Lawrence; low visibility Green put the clear stuff to shame.  Rigs were exactly the same except for the line, and the green out-fished the other stuff probably 3:1.  Have switched over to fireline crystal though, and that seems to be pretty equal to the green, so maybe it wasn't as much of a factor as we initially thought."
