315676,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-10 16:57:00,260,"  Alrighty, solved a long standing argument about the 2008-2009 regs specifically the Zone 17 omission of Percy Reach.  Spoke with an MNR rep today who has confirmed they have fixed the way the regs read.  It now clearly states Perch and Crappie open all year for that area  Here is a link to the changes.  It includes all zones affected.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/239044.pdf  This next link will give you the main page to the new 2009 regs.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_163615.html  Hurry up ice out"

315739,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-10 19:17:00,260,Bump.  I have added another url.
315749,gogu392,2009-03-10 19:37:00,142,"Hi There,  Is Carp a crapie or not?  There are no specification for Carp.  Regards."
315751,capt bruce,2009-03-10 19:41:00,820,No carp and crappie are not the same kinds of fish
315755,GBW,2009-03-10 20:02:00,8460,Did I read that right?  I can fish for perch all year now at the cottage (Burnt River area)?
315763,Jet,2009-03-10 20:29:00,364,So zone 17 is open for pan fish in winter? That's kinda what I gathered from reading that government document.
315771,MCTFisher9120,2009-03-10 20:46:00,3761,Great looks like im still good to go for Zone 18 Pike fishing
315904,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-11 01:11:00,260, No not exactly Jet; You have to read the exceptions portions...there are only a few places for zone 17 where winter fishing is allowed.
315950,GBW,2009-03-11 02:57:00,8460,"I read it the same way Jet did and that ALL of zone 17 will be open all year round for pan fish...  can you ask the CO you spoke to about this?  If this is the case then I am off to get some new winter ""toys"" ASAP!"
315959,Tom McCutcheon,2009-03-11 03:27:00,627,"Read ther exception. It says ""Trent River from the first dam (number one) above Lake Ontario upstream to lock 9 (Myers Lock) at the head of Percy Reach."" No where does it say all of zone 17."
315960,Sinker,2009-03-11 03:32:00,8692,Some of you guys need to learn how to read a little better. Tomfoolery has it right.  Sinker
315961,steelheader42,2009-03-11 03:33:00,44,Does anyone know if they made any changes in zone 16 for walleye in the Thames river? or is it the same has last year closed from March 15 till May 15... Steve.
315969,GBW,2009-03-11 04:07:00,8460,I had to ask to be sure...  After all if I was unsure then I would not fish but what about others on my lake...
316089,Tom McCutcheon,2009-03-11 16:05:00,627,No problem GBW; Now you and others who were'nt sure know.
316165,robb,2009-03-11 20:34:00,6,Good news - look forward to spring!!
