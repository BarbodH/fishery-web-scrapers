315615,DukasGT,2009-03-10 14:48:00,3,"That's not too encouraging.   Also, I would like to know what species it holds.  I'd love to get into a mess of whitefish or perch, maybe some lake trout?  Are there any good lakes close by within a half hour drive or so?   Thanks a ton!"
315632,anders,2009-03-10 15:49:00,1168,Are you talking Kabenung north of Wawa?
315643,solopaddler,2009-03-10 16:10:00,8605, Unless there's another one that's the one I was talking about.
315711,anders,2009-03-10 18:38:00,1168,"LOL..you never know sometimes!  Anyways...the lake is coming back...the walleye fishing is pretty good now, with some fair sized fish in it. Also, not many people know that there is a decent smallmouth bass population in the lake now, and a few people from Wawa head there, just for them, as there are not many places around here for bass.  Also, it is a big lake with lots of islands, and you can get lost fairly easy, so GPS is hihly recommended."
316083,DukasGT,2009-03-11 15:25:00,3,"Good to know! that is the lake I'm referring too.  I love bass fishing.  How's the pike population?  My Dad Has it in his head he's going to catch a monster.  I'm getting a GPS this weekend being as it's my birthday soon.  Happy to hear about the eyes too, I don't want anything huge, just something to eat for lunch type of deal.  Thanks for the replies!"
