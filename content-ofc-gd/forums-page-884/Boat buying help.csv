Im trying to keep the price down near $4000 and for that im probably looking at an early 90's boat and motor.  My question is what are typical problems asociated with a boat this age and how do I spot these problems on inspection.  So far I have been on all the clasifieds every day and there is a pretty good amount to choose from. Would anyone recomend going to a dealer?  Thanks  Steve."

Fiberglass usually has wood associated with it and that's what you have to concern yourself with, it can get soft and mushy usually in the floor and transom, also look for bubbles under the clear coat. The motor is another whole issue, best thing to do is demand a on the water test ride. Good Luck."

Look for damage to the boat underside and lower end of motor ( fresh paint ?)  Pull the cowling off the motor and see if anythuing looks like its been worked on ( thats not on the maintenance records) ie lose wiring harnesess , cracked paint at bolts etc .  If you search ' buying used baots' I am sure you'll come up with something as this has been discussed many time s, by those that knOW a heck of a lot more than me about boats/motors.  Good luck  TB"
315846,Billy Bob,2009-03-10 23:33:00,5865,The BEST advice on a used boat it take it for a ride before even thinking of leaving a deposit. If they don't want to let you launch it and operate it then there is a REASON behind that and drive away.  Bob

When you buy a house you get a home inspection, when you buy a boat get it inspected because if you breakdown in the middle of Erie, you might not make it home. Just my two cents. Good luck with the search, if I run across anthing I'll let you know."
