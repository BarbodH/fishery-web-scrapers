315944,OhioFisherman,2009-03-11 02:49:00,6623,"Ya no clue what the deal is, details not sure a job loss was mentioned on the news here."
315954,Sinker,2009-03-11 03:16:00,8692,Crazy!  Anyone hear from GCD today??
316064,Maverick,2009-03-11 14:20:00,371,"loaded up the site and not only did I see that but posted a minute ago 15 dead in Germany school shooting. What the hell is the world coming to??? I've gotten pissed off before sure, but never did it cross my mind to go on a shooting rampage!"
316071,Greencoachdog,2009-03-11 14:34:00,8163," That was way down near the Florida state line Sinker, about a 5 hour drive for me.  It is a tragedy for the folks in that small town, and a terrible thing to happen anywhere."
316081,highdrifter,2009-03-11 15:12:00,2534,"  HAHAH!!  Careful doode, I hear Glen's real handy with a Skein Dhu!!  HD"
316084,OhioFisherman,2009-03-11 15:26:00,6623,"Terrible thing to happen for sure, Glen I was pretty sure you were farther north, not like yankee north just a bit closer to the middle.  Had some moron shoot and kill like 5 family members here then himself over the weekend? Saves a trial, the world is a crazy place."
316085,kemper,2009-03-11 15:38:00,2232,Some things just dont make sense.  Ive got 3 midterm exams and two final papers due this week...and Im about to blow a gasket as we speak but something like that just would never cross my mind.  I dont get it.
316170,robb,2009-03-11 20:46:00,6,Sad day and then see what happened in Germany. Was in Washington DC on business this week and took a drive through Arlington natiornal cemetary - they have 30 burials a day of soldiers and seeing what is going on it is tough when you see a funeral in Arlington for a solider who fought for freedom and people do things like this in Alabama....just wrong.
316194,Cookslav,2009-03-11 21:53:00,1457,"Cripes... It never ceases to baffle me how someone can take that big of a nose dive and yet not have one single person see the warning signs. So sad,"
