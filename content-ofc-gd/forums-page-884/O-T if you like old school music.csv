Left 45 minutes before I had to be at the doctors, got 2 miles from the house and tranny problems, had my daughter with me to call 911 in case I fall. Came home to get her car and she has a nail or piece of wire sticking out the side wall of her tire and it was low. So canceled the doctor, called my wife at work and told her not to goof off when she gets done so she can follow our kid to the tire store.  Two doctors in 3 days was too much any way. LOL Got enough bad news monday to last awhile."
