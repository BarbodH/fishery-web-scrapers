315861,danbouck,2009-03-11 00:10:00,4380,Well I decided it was time to upgrade my vehicle. I was going to buy a newer XL Denali but decided to save some money for now.  So I sold this    and bought this    then decided to get this    I am hoping that we get one more little snow storm this year to rip around on it but at least I will put in a lot more ice fishing next year!  On the other hand I wanna get my boat out because I'm going crazy. I haven't been fishing since the fall
