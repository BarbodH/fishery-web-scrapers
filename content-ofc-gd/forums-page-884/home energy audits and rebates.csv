The only problem with the great program is actually getting your Rebate!  I did the Eco Energy Audit last year (A/C, Furnace, Attic insulation, doors, toilets) and while we should be getting close to $3K we have been waiting for the cheque since November 2008.  When we called to find out what the hold up was, apparently due to the popularity of the programme, they ran out of money to pay the rebates!  Funny how they demand immediate payment on things like income tax...yet are conveniently out of cash when it comes to paying out...it has to work both ways though right!  I'm not impressed...here is the link - http://ecoaction.gc.ca/ecoenergy-ecoenergi...0090226-eng.cfm  Tony"
