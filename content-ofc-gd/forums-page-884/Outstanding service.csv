I called him at 3:00 yesterday and luckily he had the exact item in stock and said he'd get it on the courier truck ASAP and sure enough, it arrived at my door in Toronto at 1:00 today.  Pretty good service I'd say with only 22 hours from the time I called him till I had it in my hand. I'm heading north on Saturday to do the work and he even told me to call him if I have any problems and he'd walk me thru the installation.  Not too many box stores offer that kinda customer service.  Anyways, he's a nice guy and  I just thought I'd give him a bit of free SPAM and let everyone know that if your lookin for anything  for your boat, maybe give him a try and you may be as happy with the service as I am.  It's nice to deal with nice people  http://www.proctormarine.com/index.asp"
