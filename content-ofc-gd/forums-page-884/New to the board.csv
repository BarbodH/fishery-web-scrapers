316070,motion,2009-03-11 14:32:00,403,"Thanks for all your kind words in welcoming my son to the board. He is truly a student of the sport and I know this board has a wealth of knowledge available to him. Thank-you all for sharing that with us.  I enjoyed fishing growing up, but he truly has a passion for the sport. I am also fortunate to know where he is on the week ends. Too many kids his age are looking to cause trouble, joining gangs etc. His only concern is which one of his buddies is coming fishing with us. I only wish more kids shared his passion.  ....and yes I am taking the day off on Friday to take him fishing.   What better excuse to take a day off work!!!!"
316077,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-11 14:56:00,2050,"lol I was just going to say ""sounds like you have to take the day off Dad""  Welcome to the board fishman2202!

316120,PERCHER,2009-03-11 17:58:00,787,Welcome to the board Fisherm2202.If you are anything like your dad you are a good guy in my books.I to have a son (18) who just l o v e s to fish.Cant get him off the water most times.Fishing is one of the best things for kids to get involved in.It does keep them out of trouble.Tony there is no better fishing partner to have than your son.Congrats guys. Dan
316131,motion,2009-03-11 18:23:00,403,"Thanks Dan. BTW, the auger works great.   My son poked around 20 holes with it on Saturday and had it mastered after a couple. Looking forward to using it one last time Friday."
316139,Spiel,2009-03-11 19:03:00,9065,Great to have both of you on board. Wish I could get my son a little more interested in fishing. Even the promise of missing school doesn't motivate him.
