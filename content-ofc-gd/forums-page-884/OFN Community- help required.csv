314836,Carp,2009-03-08 16:40:00,1488,"We're having trouble finding a place to store our ice hut for the off season. Our operator in Oro closed down his business and we had to get it off his property. We brought it down to Innisfil from Oro, because a hut operator in Innisfil said he had room for it. Now, as the season is ending, he tells us he can't store it and we're left scrambling to find a place.  We may be going up there in the next few days to put it on a trailer and move it....but where? Currently it's on Lake Simcoe at the 9th Line, Innisfil, ON. (Next line north of Innisfil Beach Road)  We prefer to keep it as close to the lake as possible in the same area, but may consider other options.  If anyone has space on their lot or knows someone with a farm who may be able to help, please let me know asap. We'll gladly pay a reasonable storage fee.   Thanks"
314847,misfish,2009-03-08 17:24:00,29133, Just thinking what to charge???????????????  How bigs the hut?
314889,Terry,2009-03-08 19:39:00,14456,"there is a place on the 5th line of innisfil between highway 11 and the 20th on the south side, there seems to be lots of huts stored there every year so I would assume he does store them, but I have never seen a sign or phone number or anything"
314907,kickingfrog,2009-03-08 20:48:00,8333,"  SHHHHHHH Terry! That's the secret portal to the best brook trout fishing in all of Innisfil. Man, now everyone will put their hut there."
314909,Terry,2009-03-08 20:54:00,14456,LOL it would have to be mud cats they are fishing for
314990,Carp,2009-03-09 00:33:00,1488,  Thanks for the responses guys.  It's an 8 x 8 clad in aluminum Brian. It was $120/year at the last place. That included putting the hut on the ice and taking it off at seasons end.  I think my uncle may have talked to the guy who stores them on the 5th Line. Waiting to hear back from him.  Any more info/help ???
314999,bigfish1965,2009-03-09 01:00:00,3382,"Store it here for free if you like. Lotsa room on my lot. Not close to Oro, however."
315206,Carp,2009-03-09 17:57:00,1488," Thanks for the offer Rick. Maybe just a wee bit too far. If you were close to L. Simcoe, it would be a no brainer. We're trying to get in touch with another hut operator in the area, but haven't heard anything yet.  cheers"
315259,motv8tr,2009-03-09 19:58:00,2587,"You could put it behind my garage, the price is right, but I won't be able to put it back on the lake for you  Maureen"
315534,Carp,2009-03-10 04:22:00,1488,"Thanks Mo, but it looks like we may have a spot on the 5th Line for now."
316321,Carp,2009-03-12 04:38:00,1488,"Couldn't get a hold of the storage place on the 5th. We stored it with an operator on the fourth line in Lefroy.  Tracker, you have a message  re:storage info."
