315946,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-11 02:51:00,0,Yer thinkin clear enough if ya ask me.... Saw your name here just now and thought you got the puppy. It's too bad it went sour. Doesn't surprise me in the least Shane.
315976,chickenhawk,2009-03-11 04:48:00,612,"Look guys, im sorry that it did not work out for you Sinker, I had a number of people PM me interested in the dog.  When I posted the thread I left for work, had I been around to see your post right off the bat i would have been glad to get you as much information as I possibly could.  I can keep my ears open for any other lab puppies.  The guy who called my friends his board name was Mark Basilio. Anyways, like I said Sinker, I do apologize that it did not work out but I do know that neither of his parents hunted so I am not sure if he has it in his bloodline or not.  I will keep my ears open for you though.  Hawk"
315994,Big Cliff,2009-03-11 09:46:00,6899,"Actually Sinker perhaps you and I need to talk if you are looking for a hunting dog. Don't know if you have had a chance to meet my boy Andy yet but German Shorthaired Pointers are super with kids, and fantastic hunters. They point, track, and retreive. I have a couple of friends with GSPs that still owe me a favour or two, I might be able to hook you up if not for free, for a really good price.  You've got my number if you are interested."
316003,pikehunter,2009-03-11 11:22:00,1659," Sinker, I didn't intend to offend, just mentioning that mutts can make good companions too. Papers can be important for the right reasons for sure.  Glad the dog is going to get a new home, good job on helping the pup out Chickenhawk."
316004,tinbanger,2009-03-11 11:40:00,1028,"Knew he wouldn't last long , hope he has found a good home .  I will be scouting the local Pounds for a new pup over the next few weeks  TB"
316005,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-11 11:47:00,0,Better late than never Eh Sinker...... I have my ears to the ground for yas. You know that if I see or hear of a good one that you will be the first to know. I know for sure it will be going to a great home!  later ..
316006,Beans,2009-03-11 11:49:00,3339, Shane...Andy is a terrific dog...just ask anybody who has fished off Cliff's dock...
316167,GBW,2009-03-11 20:42:00,8460,I had two German Sheppard's (not at the same time) growing up and now I have a Lab/Retreiver cross and ALL 3 were/are great dogs!  My current dog was around before my kid's and any one of us can walk up to her and take any food that has fallen on the floor out of her mouth.  My kids are 2 and 5 and she's been that way her whole life.  I hope you get a good dog soon to all that are looking...
316213,bbog,2009-03-11 23:41:00,665,Sorry it didn't work out for you Sinker. The questions you asked are what anyone should want to know before adding a new family member.  Tough crowd... but then there is the generousity of Big Cliff! A GSP is an excellent dog if you're looking for a hunting companion.
316225,Gerritt,2009-03-12 00:07:00,6129,Sinker... if you are looking for a lab with a hunting linage... may I suggest here?  http://www.silverdkennels.com/  I am in no way affiliated with them... but their dogs and breeding practises are amazing.. not to mention well tempered with kids..  papered as well... and for a fair price if you ask me...  now... if only I could get him to stop digging!!!   As a pup...   6mths old and getting huge! You should see his paws...   G.
316246,motv8tr,2009-03-12 00:43:00,2587,"Geez. Gerritt I can see how big those paws are in that picture, he'd gonna be a big boy  They are great dogs...  Maureen"
316253,chickenhawk,2009-03-12 00:51:00,612,that's one good lookin dog...hes gonna be a big boy...
315413,chickenhawk,2009-03-10 00:55:00,612,"A couple friends of mine just recently had a baby, and they are struggling to deal with Jack, the 4 month old pure bred yellow lab as well as the baby.  Unfortunately they have to give Jack away.  Jack still needs his rabies shots and has not been neutered yet.  If anyone is interested, you will not have to pay anything, you will just have to take care of his shots.  Here is a pic of Jack as a young pup, he has grown up quite a bit since then, I will see if I can get a more recent picture.  "
315440,trapshooter,2009-03-10 01:39:00,1234,"For dog sakes man, don't let my wife see this!!!"
315448,Sinker,2009-03-10 02:02:00,8692,"Need more info.  Where is the dog located? Can I see him first? I'm assuming its a he?? Is he pure bred, meaning with papers?? Does he have any hunting in his blood lines??  I'm interested.  Sinker"
315452,bigfish1965,2009-03-10 02:08:00,3382,"Whomever gets this dog..please get him neutered. Leaving your dog 'in tact' especially in retriever breeds, makes cancer a real threat. Dang..he is cute though...too bad i already have two!"
315558,pikehunter,2009-03-10 10:07:00,1659,"Some of the best pets come with papers....old newspapers that is, soaks up the pee and helps to housebreak them easier. A good pet doesn't need identification."

315592,FUSION,2009-03-10 13:44:00,81,WHO WANTS THIS DOG??? 
315603,Zubris21,2009-03-10 14:09:00,563,"Gorgeous pup, glad the girlfriend doesn't check this site.  In a couple years I'll be looking for a pup just like that."
315605,The Urban Fisherman,2009-03-10 14:12:00,2050,"already have a lab, a 2.5 year old, and a new baby comin' within a month or so.... otherwise he'd be comin' home with me!  good luck finding him a home dude!"
315625,Sinker,2009-03-10 15:34:00,8692," This I know......it was just a question.  I'm looking for a hunting dog. I'd hate to take a dog that isn't built for it. I don't need papers, just a dog with some drive. It has to be able to keep up with my 2 kids"
315636,Zebco,2009-03-10 16:01:00,123," Spend some money on one if you wanna pick and choose, but that dog would be great with kids!"

315848,chickenhawk,2009-03-10 23:36:00,612,"for those interested, Jack is still available as of right now.  PM me for the phone number in which to get ahold of my friends."
315910,chickenhawk,2009-03-11 01:40:00,612,"I just spoke with Roxanne, and someone from the board has gotten ahold of her and they have set something up for him to come pick up Jack on the weekend.  Sorry for those others that did not get a chance but congratulations to the person who contacted them.  Thanks for giving Jack another opportunity."
315912,BillM,2009-03-11 01:44:00,17367,Awesome news!!!!  Glad the the pup is getting a new home.
315920,Sinker,2009-03-11 02:10:00,8692,So.....who got him??  It would have been nice if you just pm'd me the info.  Thanks for nothing....  Sinker
315924,endless,2009-03-11 02:16:00,27, Holy sour grapes.  I can't imagine they're kicking themselves for not sending you a PM now.
315925,Sinker,2009-03-11 02:19:00,8692,"Yeah, sour grapes.  I was the first to reply saying I was interested. Then got a hard time because I asked a few questions, then someone else gets the dog because I wasn't on the board at the right time........Bull if you ask me.  Sinker"
315935,endless,2009-03-11 02:36:00,27,"  You just got the first post in because you were on the board at the right time too.  You're dealing with a free dog here.  It's not like they said ""first post gets the dog"".  Perhaps if you took an introspective look into your approach you'd stand a better chance next time."
315939,Sinker,2009-03-11 02:43:00,8692,"Thanks for the insight Dr Phil!  I operate a little differently.  If it was me that posted looking for someone who could take a dog from a friend who couldn't take care of it, the first poster would get dibbs on it. I would send that poster the contact info, and work from there........make sense to you?  I dunno, maybe I'm not thinking clearly tonight??"
