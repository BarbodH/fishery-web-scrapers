We marked lots of fish, but nothing overly aggressive.  Cal landed a nice whitie, I got 2 whities and Ryan landed 3 lakers.  Not a bad outing, all fish today were caught on tubes.

316017,blaque,2009-03-11 12:26:00,2419,"Ive never caught a whitie first hand , never even saw one in person, only time ive seen one is on this board lol, Sorry, there just not on the list of available species in the water i fish    But im curious why there mouths always seem to be  so red. Are they easy bleeders, is it just the color of their mouth, whats the scoop."
316020,highdrifter,2009-03-11 12:49:00,2534,mmmm VERY NOICE!  thank you for making us eat mud.  HD
316109,Fisherpete,2009-03-11 17:12:00,1814,"Blaque - whitefish like to wear bright red lipstick, just in case the fisherman whe gets them gives them a smooch. They are very sexy fish LOL. Seriously though - I don't know why they have such red mouths... maybe related to them bleeding from the gills sometimes since they are often caught and brought up from really deep water.  p.s. Steve - I am still troutless LOL!!! But see my whiteys report from Monday, had a great day!"
