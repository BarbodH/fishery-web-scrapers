316220,Squid,2009-03-11 23:57:00,1656,"Well this thread brought a tear to my eye!! Gees dog lovers or what!! Bernie, sorry to hear that you lost a true friend. Ben, my 13 1/2 year old collie/golden retriever x is old very old. He has a hard time standing up yet still wants to go for a small walk. I can still get him all excited when I call out ""Squirrel"", though no more chasing is involved. I know that my time with my friend is coming to and end and it will be an extremely difficult time for me when I have to say goodbye to Ben."
316222,bbog,2009-03-12 00:02:00,665,"My heart goes out to you Bernie. We lost our eldest Golden June 12, 2008 and feel the pain of his absence daily.  God bless."
316229,bbog,2009-03-12 00:20:00,665,"Bernie I hope you enjoy this passage that a good friend had sent to me after the passing of my best friend.  ""God summoned a beast from the field and he said, ""Behold Man, created in my own image. Therefore, adore him. You shall protect him in the wilderness, shepherd his flocks, watch over his children, accompany him wherever he may goâ€¦even unto civilization. You shall be his companion, his ally, his slave."" ""To do these things"" God said, ""I endow you with these instincts uncommon to other beasts: Faithfulness, Devotion, and understanding surpassing those of man himself. Lest it impair your courage, you shall never foresee your death. Lest it impair your loyalty, you shall be blind to the faults of man. Lest it impair your understanding, you are denied the power of words. Let no fault of language cleave an accord beyond that of man with any other beast or even man with man. Speak to your master only with your mind and through your honest eyes. Walk by his side, sleep in his doorway, forage for him, ward off his enemies, carry his burdens, share his afflictions, love him and comfort him. And in return for this, man will fulfill your needs and wants which shall be only food, shelter, and affection. So be silent and be a friend to man. Guide him through the perils along the way to the land that I have promised him.  ""This shall be your destiny and your immortality. So sayeth the Lord. And the dog heard and was content.""""

315309,steve_paul,2009-03-09 21:33:00,658,Sorry for your loss Bernie.  I had to do it a couple of years ago and it is so very hard.  Our thoughts are with you tonight.
315310,Rich Clemens,2009-03-09 21:35:00,3131,"That sucks Bernie.  I had to do the same thing with mine last year ... just a little over a year ago, and I still really miss her.   Just like yours, she really loved going out on the boat, the fish we caught, and the breaks to run along the shore line.   We did get a new Airedale and it's just not the same.   I honor my Nikita in my Avatar.   Sorry to hear of your loss Bernie."
315312,TJQ,2009-03-09 21:43:00,7806,That's sad bud.. sorry for your loss.

At least he's not suffering...  Take care,  Steve"
315337,Bernie,2009-03-09 22:41:00,3190,"Thank you everyone. When we got Hobbes I was against getting a dog. But this being a democratic household I relented. He turned out to be a great dog. Our youngest son Alex has disabilities and Hobbes knew it. If Alex was upset Hobbes would go and try to calm him by nuzzling or rubbing his body on Alex. Through the open water months I pretty much live at the cottage and commute. Hobbes was always ready to go no matter to or fro. If somebody even mentioned ""boat"" he was in it. If someone was in the water swimming so was he. Mostly because he was worried for them and tried to herd people to shore. Such was his nature. He was very rarely tied. He knew the borders of our house in town and would not leave them unless permission was granted. My parents live 4 houses away and Hobbes loved my mom. ""Go see Grandma"" and he was gone to see her (she made him cookies). Our cottage is on an island and he had complete freedom to roam but rarely did. He was always within calling distance (Possibly just in case it was suppertime). Although last night he could barely walk anymore he still made the effort to ""go"" outside. He maintained his dignity until the end. Thank you again for letting me write his epitaph here. It makes me sad but he deserves it."
315339,aplumma,2009-03-09 22:46:00,6896,Sorry to hear this bernie..... Time will heal your heart and then go to the shelter and give a new life to a dog that needs you.   Art
315344,bigugli,2009-03-09 22:50:00,6138,"I am so sorry Bernie. My old girl is 13 and going blind and it worries me. I get that lump just thinking about it, and I've hated the times I've put my closest companions down over the years.  You gave him his peace. It's the best you could do for him."

Many of you're friends (myself included) have interacted with Hobbes and knew what a special family member he was.... He sure loved the water!  sad to hear that he needed you to make the right decision for him... He will be missed by many that is certain..  He was a great dog.  G..
315392,Leecher,2009-03-10 00:25:00,7832,So sorry to hear of this sad news Bernie.  Wish I could say something to ease the pain your family is going through but unfortunately there are none.

315450,Sinker,2009-03-10 02:06:00,8692,"Sorry to hear that Bernie.......I know how you feel.....and it sucks!  The only thing that would make a dog better, is if they lived as long as thier owners. Its always tough losing  your best friend.  We did the same a year and a half ago, and I'm just now looking for a replacement.  Sinker"
315474,walleyemen,2009-03-10 02:31:00,316,"Bernie sorry to hear about hobbes, i have a retreiver that looks just like him Neil or by his nick name ole red, Bernie this is a story i found awhile back that touched me very much so and i'd like to share it with you! ""A Truer Freind"" ....by ""Wild Bill""  Recently, my fishing buddy of long years died. Now I realize what a true friend he was; I didn't thnk I'd miss him this much.    Patrick was  born without arms, and could not speak, and sadly had been estranged from his family while very young. We met and quickly became freinds, mostly because we shared a love of the great outdoors. Somehow, we communicated, me through speaking, him through facial expressions, and we found we also loved being on the water. I took him out on my boat, and from that day on, I would not think of going without Patrick; he got such joy from those trips.   While I fished and controlled the boat from the front deck, he would lay on the rear deck, his head hanging overboard, peering into the waters looking for fish. He'd spot fish, and then motion to me. He got as excited as i did when I hooked and landed fish. Once,as I was battling a very feisty Smallmouth, Patrick, in his typically over-excited and enthusiastic state, slipped and fell overboard. Fortunately,he was wearing his modified lifejacket, and from his position in the water, got to see the fish landed and then released. I finally controlled my laughter enough to help him back onto the rear deck, where he dried himself off while I continued to chuckle.   Being a Pisces may explain my forty-year love affair with Bass fishing. Grandpa and my Dad  introduced me to the sport when I was only six. Grandpa bought a home on a small lake outside Kansas City, MO, and we summered there every year of my childhood. I learned to cast plugs to the shoreline and docks, and to drag a plastic worm for Bass, all the while bonding  with Grandpa and Dad.   Patrick never got to go fishing before I took him, never once had the pleasure of making a great cast, and I'd swear he got a bigger adrenaline rush and his heart would beat faster than mine whenever i caught a fish. Just being on the water was his ""nirvana"".   Most of my buddies didn't want to come along if they heard I was bringing Patrick, because he had  a hard time controlling his excitement. The rear deck became his domain, and he rarely would cede it, unless he was told to. I rarely had the heart not to take him, so we spent a lot of time together.The thrill of the sport was what he and I thrived on, and I now try to share that with others by mentoring them in the joys of fishing and the great outdoors.   Less than a week before Patrick died, we shared our final fishing trip, and it comforts me to know I made his life happier by taking him along on all those trips. He returned the favor by sharing his excitement and joy with me. Fishing isn't quite the same now without him, as I miss being with him.   I just returned from the lake, the first trip since since my buddy died. I had motored through the early morning fog to our favorite spot, the point I had caught that fish so many years earlier when Patrick had fallen in. As I approached, an ominous feeling came over me, as if signalling me where to cast. Maybe it was the moment, but as I positiioned the boat, I felt that Patrick was there in spirit, guiding me, as always.   My watermelon-colored senko had barely hit the water when there was a giant swirl, right where my bait landed. I reeled down, and then set the hook, and a hefty four pound Smallie came rocketing up out of the water, almsot three feet in the air. It gave me quite a tug, and the battle was intense, re-affirming why I was there, and lifting my spirits on that spot where my buddy and I had shared so many good times together. I landed the chunky Smallmouth and looked it over carefully, as it looked so much like that fish I'd landed 12 years earlier, the day Patrick had  fallen in the water.   Gently, I slipped the fish back into the water. I knew right away where my next throw should land, and it did, but it made a different sound as it landed, and there was no swirl this time, anf no tug. A very happy, yet sad feeling overcame me as I watched my departed freind's ashes, now intermixing with my tears, as they sank through the water. we had indeed shared a special freindship through our years together.   Suddenly, a smallmouth shot out of the waters, right between my boat and the boulder strewn point. I thought it was the one I had just released, and I knew right then I had brought Patrick to his heaven.   I will cherish forever the moments I shared with Patrick, my Golden Retreiver.   Share fishing with someone....."
