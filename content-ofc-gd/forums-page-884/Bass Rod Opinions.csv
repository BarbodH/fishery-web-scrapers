315896,tschirk,2009-03-11 00:55:00,261,"I want to pick up a new Curado 200e or 300e and rod to match. I mostly cast texas rigged with Senko worms. What rod do you like and why? I am considering Shimano Compre IM8 CPC-X610MH Casting 6’10” Med.Heavy ExtraFast 10-20lb 3/8-1oz 1Tip+9 What other rods should I look at? Thanks, Ted"
315900,diggyj,2009-03-11 01:05:00,548,Shimano Crucial Rods are dynamite.
315909,mikeh,2009-03-11 01:39:00,824,The carrot sticks are super light with a great warranty. I'd recommend the 200 curado for a worm rod as I think the 300 is too big.
315916,jace,2009-03-11 01:51:00,472,how much weight are you putting on there?   I'm thinking a 300 size of any model is too much reel to cast those lighter plastic rigs and nearly impossible if it's a weightless rig.
315918,salmon,2009-03-11 01:57:00,334, Agreed The 300 is more of a pike\muskie reel. I have the 200E5 for pike and Bass. The rod I would rec. would be St. Croix AvidAC70MF. I wacky rig 95% of the time. Jose
315942,OhioFisherman,2009-03-11 02:47:00,6623,"Don`t have any Curados but the 300 is bigger not sure how much of a size weight difference, doubt it it is more than an ounce or two. 200 size is fine for bass and probably all but the largest size pike on a regular basis. Just can`t see a need for a 300 for bass fishing unless you would regularly fish in an area loaded with 10 pounders.  A lot of decent rods out there. I have diawa heartland, shimano convergence, berkley lighting rods, abu garcia rods, comfort and length I like mine 6 1/2 to 7 foot a 7-6 for flipping."
315956,JPD,2009-03-11 03:18:00,296,"Hi Ted,  Good choice there... go with the 200 E7 for flipping the 300's will be too much of a difference is weight for that application. For the rod, I would suggest going up one size and getting the CPCX70MH - 7'0""... that little bit of extra length will help with your hook sets.  That will be a sweet combo for what you want to do.  Good luck  JP"
315996,lew,2009-03-11 09:57:00,12766,"You'll be happy with the Compre Ted, their an excellent rod at a great price.  I've been swapping out all my St. Croix musky rods and replacing with Compre's."
316022,Blake,2009-03-11 12:50:00,418,"The Curado is going to be a great reel for ya and the 6 10 Compre will fit the bill nicely.  If you want to look at others the Shimano Crucial 7' 2"" H rod will also be an awesome setup and the Crucial has the 6'10"" model also.  Happy shopping."
316302,tschirk,2009-03-12 02:50:00,261,Thanks all.. Sounds like a 200 with a 7' rod it will be!
