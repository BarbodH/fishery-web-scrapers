316047,e-z-out,2009-03-11 13:51:00,1052,Thats why i asked for feedback thanks bruce
316063,Stoty,2009-03-11 14:20:00,2910,"Ya, I agree. If you want to learn how to make your own website, this is a great site to learn from!"
316066,Maverick,2009-03-11 14:26:00,371,"Yeah, That video is rated Income for Life... hmmmm.  There are tons of resources on the net and if you are really inclined you can always take a course at a local university or college."
316068,bigfish1965,2009-03-11 14:27:00,3382,Yup..pyramid reseller. For just a little more effort you can do your own hosting and reselling. This is someone else making money off of your work. They claim to be the only registrar of the .ws tdl which means you are stuck with them and cutting out the middle man is not possible. There are thousands of web templates on the internet for free.
316072,e-z-out,2009-03-11 14:34:00,1052,Thanks guys for the feedback now i know it's a scam so i wont be sticking around. Thanks for the site stoty i'll give it a try
316073,ch312,2009-03-11 14:40:00,1590,"i tried out a pyramid scheme (before knowing how they work) and yes they do work and yes you can make big money. the only problem is you never know when you are the next one in line to be ripped off and lose your $$$.  the one i used was paying off quite well (44% returns) and some members were putting in $6k investments. all investments yielded a return of 44% every 12 days or a maximum of $2640. thats $5k/month for doing nothing. this site was running for at least a year so the big spenders sure made some decent money off it. i put in $200 or so and it lasted for a few months and i made $600 or so.  but then out of nowhere the owner of the website took off with millions of dollars and everyone was screwed...her plan all along. i didnt lose any of my money, but im sure many people lost quite a bit of $$$.  live and learn i guess...."
