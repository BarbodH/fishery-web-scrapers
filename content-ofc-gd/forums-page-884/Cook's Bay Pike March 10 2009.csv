316372,snag,2009-03-12 13:26:00,1932,I'm lovin' your vids man!  I admire the guts it takes to stick your hand down the hole to retrieve a toothy critter full of trebles.  
316386,Greencoachdog,2009-03-12 13:58:00,8163,That was a great vid!!!  Are you just using a single hook?... because the thought of being attached to a mean-  Pike by a treble hook while under the ice makes my butthole pucker severely!!!
316398,Headhunter,2009-03-12 14:23:00,5703,"Great Vid man! Nice fish as well! I couldn't help but notice that as the video went on, your hands were beginning to match your red coat!!! Thanks for posting! HH"
316435,ehg,2009-03-12 15:41:00,2666,Nice job on catching that real nice pike. Brutal having to stick your arm way in the water to get it on the ice.  Congrats that is tough work
