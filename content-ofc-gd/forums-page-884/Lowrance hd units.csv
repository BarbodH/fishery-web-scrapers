When i said the brochures and web sites all say the chips should work, why are they having a problem  The salesman said the navionics people are developing a new chip and haven't got it ready yet for these units. as a result the salesman at cabelas said they weren't ordering in any more units until the chips are available.  Any guys on this board having problems with these units?"
