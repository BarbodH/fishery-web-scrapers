315596,kuhaman,2009-03-10 13:50:00,503,I let my dog out this morning and when I called him back in he stunk so bad I gagged. He found a skunk and decided to get a little to close and got sprayed. Anyone have a good remedy for getting rid of the smell? I tried this stuff called skunk off but it doesn't seem to be working. Any ideas?
315599,e-z-out,2009-03-10 13:58:00,1052,same thing happen to my dog i washed him in tomato juice it worked great.  wash him down with the tomato jucie then wash it off and repeat. Then just use his dog shampoo and everything should be good.  Hope that helps
315644,huey graphite,2009-03-10 16:10:00,362,"Yes....my yellow lab got it in the face a few years ago. I tried tomato juice which only masked it. Then tried dog shampoo which helped a little. What really did the trick was a formula I found online. It was a combination of hydrogen peroxide, baking soda and a teaspoon of lemon dish detergent (mixed in a bowl and allowed to bubble). Apply to the dogs coat, let sit for  10 minutes and rinse. Got rid of the smell for the most part. Could only smell skunk if I stuck my nose in her fur. Time is the only thing that will get rid of it completely.  Insructions can be found here.  http://dan.drydog.com/patsyann/skunk.html"

I found the tomatoe juice just masks the odour and when the dog gets wet you will still smell it bad  I think I used water, hydrogen peroxide and something else...... Not sure if it was dish soap or baking soda.  GOOGLE is your friend.  Hope this helps  B"

315675,tinbanger,2009-03-10 16:55:00,1028,Coke worked on our dog a couple of times that she got sprayed.Cheap and easy to get .I think part fo the trick was washing her with it within a few minutes. Worked well.  TB

315729,capt bruce,2009-03-10 19:04:00,820,"Had a family of the buggers move in last summer under my garage , My stupid german sheppard was getting sprayed two three times a week .I tried all the home made stuff my friends told my about and bought a few of the skunk out things at the pet store what I found that worked was just plain old dish soap , a good washh and rinse with lemon dish soap was the best thing I found . Whan i finally managed to trap one of them the animal control guy just checked him out and than RELEASED IT at the end of my driveway !!!!!! Funny tho a few days latter they just all died, sad so very very sad ???? Must had been a murder suicide or one of the young skunks was playing with a loaded gun , skunk home invasion , toronto is becomeing a dangerous place sh#t happens , who knows with skunks ??? but ya they all died and I burried them in the garden , no more smelly dog"
315752,kuhaman,2009-03-10 19:51:00,503,Well I re applied the skunk off and it seems to be doing the trick(used the whole bottle). Maybe Ill get lucky and have the same thing happen that happened to capt bruce's skunks

315785,rowingsunny,2009-03-10 21:13:00,11,"I have a dalmation and he has been sprayed twice and I know what you mean when you say you gagged.  First time I was out in a field throwing a ball and he ran off and chased it and lost that battle.  I had to tie him in the back of my pick up and back it into the driveway and use the bed as a bathtub with the garden hose.  I used tomatoe juice, skunk off shampoo followed by head and shoulders shampoo and then a final rinse with toothpaste and that seemed to work.  Good luck"
315788,pameladallaire,2009-03-10 21:23:00,470,"The online recipe, originally shown on tv, works better than the store brands.  I had my lab sprayed twice in an hour while I was at the camper in the winter.  Couldn't leave the dog outside so I washed him with the mixture rinsed and dried him in front of the fireplace.  He slept in my sleeping bag that night.  Just so you know, you have only about 5 hours before the oil sinks into the skin pores and has to grow out.  Do it immediately!  Pam"
315797,Big Cliff,2009-03-10 21:45:00,6899,"I tried most of the products out there including Skunk Off and they all seemed to work to some degree but then I tried this one and it was by far the best.  NokOut  I even use it for my hunting clothing, live well on my boat."
315855,EC1,2009-03-11 00:01:00,930,"Wow, all of these remedies. It's going to be useful if that ever happens to me in the future.  But all this talk has me wondering, a dog's nose is ever soooooooooo strong, do they hate it? Or do they act like nothing happened except they're now walking around like a skunk?"
315871,codered,2009-03-11 00:20:00,123,"My sheltie fought and  got sprayed a few years ago . lett me tell you   I went threw 3 bottles of skunk be gone. tomatoe juice.. poroxide and dish soap . baking soda and tonic water.. everything i could find.. The fine fur of this little guy wouldn""t let the smell go away.. I think after 4 months and 40 bathes  it was still linguring .. Good luck with the battle.."
315898,Whitespinnerbait,2009-03-11 01:03:00,2038,Peroxide/ Baking Soda/dishsoap is the Only way to go ..............   The trick is to let it soak in for ten minutes before rinsing it off    BTW... tomato juice has been scientifically proven to do absolutely nothing when it comes to removing any odour
