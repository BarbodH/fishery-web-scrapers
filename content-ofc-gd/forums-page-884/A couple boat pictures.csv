314989,motv8tr,2009-03-09 00:27:00,2587,Very nice Lew!  Maureen

315033,Pigeontroller,2009-03-09 02:25:00,2793,Is there anything more exciting than waiting to get a new boat?  Nice looking machine there Lew!
315036,Rattletrap2,2009-03-09 02:32:00,1652,Wow Lew! I can't believe I totally missed the fact that you got yourself a new boat! I'm sure there must have been a few posts on the subject before now? That is one sweet looking set-up.  Did you trade the Crestliner in? That would have been a nice boat to pick-up.  Congratulations!
315042,tschirk,2009-03-09 02:59:00,261,"Awsome ride Lew, I wish you many fine Musky visits in it!"
315064,Blue_Axela,2009-03-09 06:04:00,88, Nice boat!  Are you looking to sell the Terrova?  How many lbs is it and what is the shaft length?
315066,SlowPoke,2009-03-09 08:28:00,2984,  ...anyway...   Great looking ride there Lew. Nice colour combo!
315067,lew,2009-03-09 08:55:00,12766,"Thanks again folks, it should be an enjoyable fishing season.   Your right Dax, but it's gonna be a very long 6 weeks waiting till I pick it up   The Crestliner was bought by a good friend of mine Brian and it's nice to know it's going to a family that'll look after it and have many years of fun and fishing in it.   Sorry Blue_Axela, but the dealer is swapping the motors before I even take delivery of the boat.   I was thinking the same thing Brian"
315098,jwl,2009-03-09 12:55:00,1056,"nice new ride Lew, I bet you can't wait to put years of fishin in that"
315103,Fishmaster,2009-03-09 13:03:00,920,Sweet boat Lew bet you can't wait to get it outa that messy Garage ...not  sure i would like chains swining around my new boat ..
315132,Flappn,2009-03-09 14:26:00,245,What a gorgeous Machine. Congrats!
315133,TJQ,2009-03-09 14:31:00,7806,Thats great Lew.. Im with you... I cant wait to get up to camp.. its been a really long winter up here...
315156,fishnsled,2009-03-09 15:48:00,3520,"Sweet!!!!  Judging by the ice on Simcoe on the weekend it will be a while before ice out.  You could do what I did when I got mine a few years ago.  Scugog had just opened up while the other lakes were still frozen.  Went from the river down to Port Perry and back, man was it cold.  So cold that when the boat came out it had ice hanging on the sides from the spray.  Wouldn't have traded that day for any other.   First fishing day was a couple of weeks later on Simcoe and my Dad was the first one to boat a fish in my new ride.  About a 5 inch perch at a cost of $25, 000 to get us out there.  Memories to last a lifetime - priceless.  Looking forward to hearing about some of your memories in the making.  Congrats again on the new ride."
315190,lew,2009-03-09 17:29:00,12766," I know where your coming from Will and your 100% right.  It seems like alot of $$$$ when you 1st write that big cheque, but when you look back down the road on all the memories with friends & family in that boat, it doesn't seem so expensive anymore.   Good times !!"
315195,ecmilley,2009-03-09 17:37:00,2163,"nice ride Lew, btw do you need my address so you can pick me up on the way to pigeon?"
315196,lew,2009-03-09 17:40:00,12766,"Sounds good to me Ernie, I fish Pigeon alot & it'd be good to have you along"

315328,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-09 22:10:00,1362,Awesome looking ride Lew!!....hmmmm....maybe you and I should get together and break that boat in with some good ole Ottawa River MUSKIE slime   ....it's only a few more months away
315333,PERCHER,2009-03-09 22:24:00,787,Nice ride Lew.That thing will be a smooth ride.But where are the downriggers?   Congrats.. Dan
316212,Squid,2009-03-11 23:39:00,1656,Swwwwweeeettt!!!!
316268,musky_man,2009-03-12 01:27:00,159,Congrats Lew ... she is a beauty!!   
316334,lew,2009-03-12 08:35:00,12766,"   Pete (squid) and I will be spending a couple days on the Ottawa sometime this coming season and I'll let you guys know when and maybe we can set something up  We'll probably be staying in the usual place, Motel Du Champlain in Plantagenet, and will be fishing the area between Wendover & Hawksbury"
316356,corvette1,2009-03-12 12:00:00,1765,awesome ride lew congrats
314766,lew,2009-03-08 12:21:00,12766,"I went up to the dealership where I bought my boat to meet with the feller that's making the 2 custom covers for it and took a couple pics. The shop was really crowded so I couldn't get any  good pictures and these were the best I could get.  That PD bowmount Terova is coming off and I'm replacing it with a Maxxum Pro cable steer with the lift assist, which supposedly takes about 1/2 the weight off the motor for lifting in and  outta the water and should be a nice feature when putting in a long day of fishing.        The aluminum prop is being replaced with an SS      Sure wish the ice would melt on the lakes"
314768,Rich Clemens,2009-03-08 12:25:00,3131,Gonna be a sweet ride on the water this year Lew.  Looking forward to seeing her in a few months here.  A nice lean mean fishing machine.
314770,brifishrgy,2009-03-08 12:26:00,559,Very nice Lew

314772,Spiel,2009-03-08 12:28:00,9065,"It's so shiny and, and, and, and.............................new. I'm betting your gonna love the performance Lew."
314783,kickingfrog,2009-03-08 13:19:00,8333,Nice! Just remember to throttle that son of a gun back as you pass my canoe at Lakair.
314785,Roy,2009-03-08 13:57:00,13728,AHHHHHH Lew....I can feel your excitement over the boat...and with reason. It's a beauty for sure. I don't want to hurt your feelings Lew but you know what I'd like to see? It'd bring a tear to my eye to see Eddy and you in that boat for the inaugural musky run. Dang that would be nice!!!
314786,2 tone z71,2009-03-08 14:01:00,1311,"sweet package Lew,very Nice setup,I thought the Yamahas came factory with the Black SS props could be wrong thou"
314789,Mike the Pike,2009-03-08 14:14:00,3421,Very nice package you have there Lew she is really big wide and long.  It really shows you can't wait to hit the water because you already have a salty rod holder mounted for musky.
314790,Guest gbfisher,2009-03-08 14:15:00,0,Nicely dialed Lew.
314791,BUSTER,2009-03-08 14:16:00,1336,"oh boy, thats nice color."
314792,Greencoachdog,2009-03-08 14:19:00,8163,A beautiful boat for sure Lew!!!  It needs some fish slime on it real bad though!!!
314809,lew,2009-03-08 15:18:00,12766,"Thanks boys.   Not hurting my feelings at all Roy, infact I appreciate your thoughts.  It's funny you said that though cause just yesterday I was saying to Diane how nice it woulda been to have both Jim & Ed along on the 1st fishin trip."
314810,Gerritt,2009-03-08 15:19:00,6129,Ohhh that is one SWEET looking ride!!!
314818,Terry,2009-03-08 15:45:00,14456,if that thing had some muskie slime on it it would be perfect
314822,darsky,2009-03-08 15:52:00,586,yer gonna love the full windshield !
314823,Joey,2009-03-08 15:57:00,9122,"Ya, I see you went for the full wrap around windshield, good move     Now I won't get cold when we go for Musky at Lakair this year  Very nice boat Lew.  We're also in the process of picking out a boat.  We've almost decided on the one we want and hopefully we'll have it within the next couple of weeks  Joey"
