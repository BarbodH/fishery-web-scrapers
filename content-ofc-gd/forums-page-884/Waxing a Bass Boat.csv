315622,Stoty,2009-03-10 15:19:00,2910,"Hey guys,  I'm getting a serious bout of ""cabin fever"", so I am going to get my Ranger prepared for it's first run by washing/waxing it. I have a jar of turtle wax for a car, I am assuming that's alright to use on the fibreglass? Or is there a special type of wax for a boat?  Cheers, *Stoty"
315640,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-10 16:04:00,10439,It will work fine. Polish away!!! Please feel free to come on over to my place and clean mine up as well.

315732,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-10 19:08:00,260,Meguiars available everywhere.  Use a quality marine wax.  http://www.meguiarsdirect.com/product_deta...?T1=MEG+FLAG+16  I have been pleased with Meguiars ;
315737,Stoty,2009-03-10 19:14:00,2910, Is there a difference between this and car wax?
315738,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-10 19:16:00,260,From what I have been told special ingredients to protect the gel coat.  Really helps with the UV protection.  When I detail our boat it looks and feels amazing.  Lasts a long time.  I have a polishing machine and it cuts down the labour time.
315742,Stoty,2009-03-10 19:24:00,2910,"Nice, thanks for the tip. I'll pick up a bottle next time I'm at CT!  Cheers"

315754,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-10 19:58:00,10439,Meguiars here too. Another 3 months and I can pull out the boat and start spring cleaning.
