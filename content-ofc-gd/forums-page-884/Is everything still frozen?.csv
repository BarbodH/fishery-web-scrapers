I think I am gonna rip the floor out of my boat and try and find the leak, but I would like to leave myself enough time to fix it by the openers. Any boat launches melted yet in the kawarthas or around Durham area Lake Ontario..."

316078,jedimaster,2009-03-11 15:01:00,3472, I had a leaky boat before and I tried that and it wouldn't leak when filled with water but in the water it would leak
