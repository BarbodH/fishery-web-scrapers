85523,glen,2007-06-19 16:00:00,2641,I heard that VHS may be what is killing the carp in Scugog.  The use of affected bait fish may put VHS in other lakes.  I want to make some catfish bait and i don't want to transfer the VHS.  Does dead bait fish still carry VHS???  What if i salt it or freeze it??? Thanks for any help.

85600,aniceguy,2007-06-19 18:51:00,1094,the virus can be transmitted via frozen fish.  The only way to ensure its not transfered is to not in fact move fish and secondly to pasturize any product.  VHS while a virulent virus would not be the cause IMHO.  Its more likely a virus that carp are highly suceptable to.

85623,glen,2007-06-19 19:27:00,2641,That is not what i wanted to hear.  I already have the bait in my freezer.  Thanks for the help though.
