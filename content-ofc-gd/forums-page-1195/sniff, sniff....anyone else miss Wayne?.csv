85307,tjsa,2007-06-19 02:13:00,1578,"Wayne??????????????  Would that be THE Wayne with 8,263 posts????  Never heard of him,   :lol:  :lol:  Must be a newbie.  Either that, or he is on holidays up in Temagami, with a soon side trip to Lakair."
85311,ccmtcanada,2007-06-19 02:15:00,7971,"Yeah...I keep wondering when Wayne Newton will perform again...I know he's old, but hey...those are classics."
85316,Roy,2007-06-19 02:16:00,13728,"Cliff, Wayne Newton is disgusting."
85320,ccmtcanada,2007-06-19 02:19:00,7971, LOL...I didn't say he was good looking...just that his songs are classics....LOL  His voice is a bit odd though isn't it??? haha.
85322,Roy,2007-06-19 02:21:00,13728,"Yeah, 50 year olds with lisps are scary."
85328,Clampet,2007-06-19 02:30:00,1947,"Yes, Wayne please come back. The thread counts are way down, laddie!"
85395,Terry,2007-06-19 11:27:00,14456,Wayne who?
85403,Mike the Pike,2007-06-19 11:52:00,3421,Its really strange to see that Wayne is not the top poster of the day  This vacation will give him plenty of time to accumalate some fish pics for a decent report  Which he was lacking.  What I do miss is how willing Wayne is to go out of his way to help others.  MTP
