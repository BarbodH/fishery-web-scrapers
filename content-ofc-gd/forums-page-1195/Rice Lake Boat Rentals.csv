I tried to call a place in Bewdley, costs $80.00 + taxes ....  Anyone here know of any other boat rentals on Rice Lake? Hoping for a price in and around $55.00 range.  Thanks!"
85299,Steelcat,2007-06-19 02:06:00,191,I don't think you can find anything under $80   You might be able to rent a boat 1/2 day (4 hrs) for something close to the amount you want

85304,Sinker,2007-06-19 02:10:00,8692,"That's crazy......I used to rent boats all the time at rice lake. $40 for the whole day!!! This is within the  last 5 or so years.....  The rental guys are soaking you guys, I feel sorry for you!  Just think, if you rent a boat once a month.....that's a payment on a brand new tinny you can call your own!!!  The rental guys are just laughing as you pull away from the docks.....  Sinker"
