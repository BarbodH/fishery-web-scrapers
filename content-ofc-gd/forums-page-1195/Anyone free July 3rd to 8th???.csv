85422,Fang,2007-06-19 12:30:00,1330,"Wow, this year is definitely jinxed. Had one of those dreaded calls last night from my buddy - Sorry man, new job and they just told me I can't get the time off for this years fly in trip. Normally have 6 or so in the group and this year it's down to 3 now.  I know it's short notice but any self sufficient member(s) of the board interetsted on a fly in fishing trip here are the details  Fly out of Temagami Tuesday July 3rd (10:30 am) short flight ~15 minutes into Diamond Lake fly out Sunday morning 10 am and head home  Walleye, Bass, Pike and Lake Trout. We do pretty well each year and last few years seeing more walleye 5 lbs +. Trolling worm harnesses and jigging gets most fish  $150 for flight + tax $75 per day per guy (5 days) + tax split all food costs (~$60 per guy)  all you gotta bring is clothes, fishing stuff and booze  PM me if you want more details. I have a recommended packing list"
85433,Whopper,2007-06-19 12:56:00,2174,"Dang Fang, I have seen and heard more of these types of reports this year, it's a shame.  A group that I have gone with in the past usually takes 8 or 10 people and this year they started with 8 and now are down to just five.  Good Luck!  Whopper"
85466,douG,2007-06-19 14:34:00,2693,"That's a great offer, but no can do - my fly in is in 3 weeks.  So far everyone is still on board for us.  Good Luck in rounding out your roster."

85587,wolfville,2007-06-19 18:17:00,396,"  Same here. Fang, if you are willing to come kidnap me the day before and release me the day after, I'm willing to give it a try. I promise I won't say anything in court that's against you"
