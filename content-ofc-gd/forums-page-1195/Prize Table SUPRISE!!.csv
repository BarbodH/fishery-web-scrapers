He says.. I was cleaning out the garage and thought you may want this stuff for the prize table...    He said.. this is to say thanks for the entertainement and knowledge I get every day from the board.  So I said... well thanks back, and we sat by the pool and had a couple of cold ones...  What a great place this board is.....  sometimes I forget."
