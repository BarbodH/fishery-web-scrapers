We are going to Birch Lake July 14-20, basically 75 air miles northwest of Ear Falls. 2 years ago we flew about 100 miles northwest of Ear Falls and it was a week later and we froze all week. Should I expect 80's during the day and 50's at night...I know to bring long johns and hooded sweatshirts.....advice welcome."
