85039,Smokey,2007-06-18 17:57:00,1278,A buddy of mine had a live well problem after the winter last year. He figures he forgot to blow out the lines before storage and water froze and split them. His was a lot of work also but a lesson learned.  Good Luck

85238,walleyedreamer,2007-06-18 23:53:00,101,"i don't think its the line going to the back of the boat smokey, because when i get it winterize at seaway every year, after my November trip to quinte. i get sea way to put anti freeze in the lines. i think, i just rush the job, because i wanted to go to balsam on Saturday. what i should have done when i had the live well out was put the plug in the bottom of the well and water tested it. for leaks. you learn by your mistakes i guess. if there is a small hole some were in the well, that i could not see at the time i had it out, at lease i can patch it from the out side. and being my second time taken the well out, should be a little quicker because i know what's involved now in taken out the live well. and i have a week of holidays coming up next week. to get it done. i be taken it to my friend mark place, so i have help this time and i will not be doing it in a field where the boat is parked when not in use. then back to balsam on June 30 for some more fishing. happy fishing, see you on the water, walleyedreamer."
