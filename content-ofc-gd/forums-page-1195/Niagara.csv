There was gates that said Security Notice and No Tresspassingso we didn't even bother going down. Just wondering were we could find some shore access to the canal. Anything would be great, Thanks in advance."
85266,Dondorfish,2007-06-19 00:49:00,1000,Xrap - there are all kinds of access points along the full stretch of the canal - Where abouts will you be going? St.Catharines? Welland? Port Colborne?   Don

Most of this area is very accessible to the public. There are also alot of places in Welland and on into Port Colborne.  Hope this helps  Don"
