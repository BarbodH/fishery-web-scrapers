85447,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-19 14:03:00,0,I just got a call from a friend that told me he got a regulations book from Lebaron and it states that Bass eason opens on the 4th Saturday of June. That would make it this Saturday.  Can anybody verify???

85456,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-19 14:17:00,0,"Thanks! My fishing partner will be thrilled. He has not had much luck last few times out! Now we can switch techniques up.I cant wait to throw my first tube and catch a smallie!!!!  The last weekend we fished deep and for the first time didn't pick up a bass, so they are in spawn mode now. Probably still are....  Good luck to all this weekend!!!"
