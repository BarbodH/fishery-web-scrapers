85340,007,2007-06-19 03:08:00,537,Sorry UrbanAngler - if I had known I would have taken a look when I was there earlier!
85383,caper,2007-06-19 10:13:00,210,"I assume you are talking about powerboats.. If so I believe this is the only place that rents them downtown. They have a bunch of 16 foot aluminums for rent. No idea on the price though. Give em a call and let us know.  http://www.qqy.ca  If you are talking about the paddle boats and stuff on the island, have no idea how much they are."
85396,urbanangler1990,2007-06-19 11:31:00,933,"thnx for trying carper, but yeah im talking about the paddle boats on the island..."
85468,urbanangler1990,2007-06-19 14:36:00,933,"nvm, i found out, 15 bux per hour, shoot, ill skip on that"
85478,ccmtcanada,2007-06-19 14:50:00,7971,Wow...that's a bit steep!!!  Dont blame you for skipping out on that idea.
85497,ADC,2007-06-19 15:22:00,82,  Its actually not that bad considering the location.  2 hours for 2 people is $15 each.  the 2 man paddle boats are actually pretty good to fish in as well.  The weeds are taking over on all the good shore spots on the island so the boat is a good idea.  I landed a few nice Pike from shore but many nicer ones with the paddle boat.  I just called the boat rental place caper mentioned and get this....  for the little aluminium boat its $75+tax per HOUR!  You can get a boat all day for that up north.  I bet the $15 p/hr for the paddle boat doesnt sound so bad now does it! hahahaha   P.S. I dont think they paddle boat rentals are open during the week as I went last Monday and it was closed. I think its just a weekend thing until summer hours start.  cheers
85532,urbanangler1990,2007-06-19 16:08:00,933,"bit too much for my budget, but 75 an hour is insanse! i had a plan for the opener on saturday but meh, ill do the usually shore fish..."
85638,BFSC Kevin,2007-06-19 19:46:00,1351,its $75 probably because tourist area and that you need a habour license i believe to be able to use a power boat from the humber river to victoria park and i forgot how far out.
85695,urbanangler1990,2007-06-19 21:19:00,933,"yea i think ur right Kev, i was planing a paddle boat, cus i dont have license, but down the tube that went"
85728,caper,2007-06-19 22:52:00,210, You don't need a harbour licence when you rent a boat from them. There's some check list they go over about the rules in the harbour and then your good to go.
