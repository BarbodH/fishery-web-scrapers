After sitting there for a while, he yells to the waiter, ""Hey, you wanna hear a blonde joke?""   The bar immediately falls absolutely silent. In a very deep, husky voice,  the woman next to him says, ""Before you tell that joke, sir, I think it is only fair given that you are blind -- that you should know five things:   1. The bartender is a blonde girl with a baseball bat.   2. The bouncer is a blonde girl.   3. I'm a 6 foot tall, 175 lb. blonde woman with a black belt in karate!   4. The woman sitting next to me is blonde and a professional weightlifter.   5. The lady to your right is blonde and a professional wrestler.   ""Now, think about it seriously, Mister. Do you still wanna tell that joke?""   The blind man thinks for a second, shakes his head, and mutters,  ""No, not if I'm gonna have to explain it five times.""   Dont get me wrong,I love Blondes,Thats why the wife dyed her hair. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA"

85658,John,2007-06-19 20:03:00,2956,"Nina (the blonde) had been married about a year when one day the she came running up to her husband jumping for joy.  Not knowing how to react, the husband started jumping up and down along with her.  ""Why are we so happy?"" he asked.  ""Honey, I have some really great news for you!"", Nina said.  ""Great"", he said, tell me what you're so happy about.""  Nina proclaims ""I'm pregnant!"".  The husband was ecstatic as they had been trying for a while.  He grabbed her, kissed her, and started telling her how wonderful it was, and that he couldn't be happier.  Then she said ""Oh, honey there's more.""  ""What do you mean more?"", he asked.  ""Well we are not having just one baby, we are going to have TWINS!""  Amazed at how she could know so soon after getting pregnant, he asked her how she knew.  ""It was easy"" Nina said, ""I went to the pharmacy and bought the 2 pack home pregnancy test kit and both tests came out positive!"""
