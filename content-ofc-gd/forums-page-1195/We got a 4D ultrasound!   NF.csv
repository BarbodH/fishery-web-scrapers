85314,mepps,2007-06-19 02:16:00,1301,"Made a visit to Kitchener this afternoon to have our 3d/4d ultrasound.  The little guy looked great, despite his unwillingness to show his entire face.  It was pretty amazing seeing the video of him moving around!  He is 27 weeks old, and around 2-3 pounds right now!        "

85473,charlesn,2007-06-19 14:42:00,551,"Cool!  The UCBaby experience was so great we went back for a 2nd time, but it was unfortunately too late and the baby was too big by that point.  I spent some time wondering about the technology, I think it is computerized rendering of normal 2D ultrasound readouts, but who knows.  In any case, when my girl was born, she looked just like she did in the 3D ultrasound so I'm pretty sure the technology works.  Best wishes for a safe delivery!  The best part of your life is about to begin.  Charles"
