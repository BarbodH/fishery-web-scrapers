85407,pikehunter,2007-06-19 11:59:00,1659,"I have never boated on Cook's Bay so I can't comment on other boaters behavior. However, I am experienced with upper Simcoe and Couchiching. It can be a boat highway through there especially on weekends and even more so on long weekends.  I can remember having my first boat out there, a 12'. WE were anchored near the channel, a big mistake! Those 40' cabin cruisers and large speedboats don't waste any time zipping through there and often they kicked up a good 3' high wake. Pretty scary in a 12'er! You learn in a hurry to smarten up or except the fact you may have to swim to shore. I figure that even though the bigger faster boat has a responsibility so does everyone. It would get pretty frustrating for the operator going fast or getting up on a plane to have to slow it down for every small fishing boat along the edge of a busy channel. I know that's where the fish often hang out but it can be a dangerous place to be."
84955,Guest lundboy,2007-06-18 16:18:00,0,"Hi Fishtank;  Cooks Bay is my home water.  Weekends are rather busy on the bay and you will have some who are joy riders that have no other intention on the weekend than to annoy people that are trying to fish.  The last time I was out there were two craft out there in front of the Crates break-wall.  One was an inflatable raft with a 40hp on it and two teens in it.  The other was a red older boat with a 75 on it that were buzzing the area back and forth weaving in and out between at least 10+ fishing boats and some of them were anchored.  These two boats were together, both manned by teens and the red boat was even more annoying because they kept blowing the horn as much as they could, and making a wake.  Turns out they were from a scout group of some sort and were being egged on by a bunch in a yacht moored in Crates.  It also seems that this sort of thing is worse at the beginning of the season than it is later...  I guess as new boaters and kids come of age to drive higher powered craft.  I have noticed that Cooks Bay Police patrol by York Regional is down from what it used to be.  They do keep 2 boats docked at Crates, and in previous years both used to be out full time on the weekends, now I usually see them both docked or only one out.   Also speed limits are in effect for operation of a craft within 30 meters from shore:  http://www.tc.gc.ca/MarineSafety/TP/TP511/environment.htm  ""Provinces from Ontario, westward to and including British Columbia (inland waters only in British Columbia) have adopted province-wide restrictions limiting speed to 10 km/h within 30 m (98’ 5”) from shore on all waters within their boundaries, except for: *  Waterskiing, where the boat follows a trajectory perpendicular to the shore * In rivers less than 100 m (328’ 1”) in width, or canals or buoyed channels * In waters where another speed is prescribed under a schedule to the regulations  This limit is not posted.""  Here is a link to the Office of Boating Safety.  They have a sign which they encourage anyone to post at local docks and loading ramps explaining the expected behavior and where to report incidents.  http://www.tc.gc.ca/BoatingSafety/careless.htm  Other than that, yes Cooks Bay is busy on the weekends,  but I have noticed a decline in the last two years... I think because of gas prices."

84993,Pasquale,2007-06-18 17:03:00,29,"WOW this is great, it spoke to a couple of people about this web site and they said that the OFNers on this site are very helpful, and you know what you guys and gals are. So I guess the answer to my post is fish at your own risk and most of all fish with both eyes open because you never know what will hapen on the water."
85012,Hellfish,2007-06-18 17:28:00,308,"  I would hafta agree with you, your safety first, cant help what those idiots do, but like others said make sure u arent the one in the wrong doing, meaning channels and such. this is a great topic too bad we couldnt get some of those idiots on here to explain their side of the story"
85127,lookinforwalleye,2007-06-18 20:18:00,4399,"The lakes we fish are for the most part public this means fishing boats,pontoon boats, water skier`s and even the jet skier`s have equal right to use the water. I happen to fish Scugog a lot and at times you will see the marked channel in front of Goreski`s clogged with fishing boats kinda hard for a guy in a 40 foot cruiser to weave his way through the mess. I find for the most part people are pretty courteous on the water but there are exceptions personally I find other small fishing boats to be a pain in the arse, numerous times I have had other fisherman drive right through where I am fishing not 30 feet or so from where I`am casting."
85129,bigfish1965,2007-06-18 20:25:00,3382,"If, somehow, I approach a boat that I wasn't expecting or did not see until I was close, I maintain full plane as Cliff has said. This produces the least wake (other than dead slow of course). Anglers are usually more considerate boaters than non-anglers in my experience. If you are in a  channel, then you are in an open area and the travelling boat has the ROW. But, boaters are always responsible for their wake.,"
85150,Carmen,2007-06-18 21:18:00,72,"Not something I'm proud of, or would even suggest but we were kids, maybe 30 years ago, we used to do alot of family fishing trips to North Beach PP and in the evening stay a the village motel in Wellington, ont. One day two guys kept running just off shore cutting several of our lines, sure enough re-tie cast out and it's like they were wainting for us to go threw the whole routine and again right over our lines after the third time we got wise into the tackle box put on the nice 1 oz sinkers and make a false cast and wait just as they make thier approch we grab the rods, take aim and fire don't remember hitting either of them but they sure didn't make another pass. Hope it wasn't any of our board members if it was SORRY. Kids will be kids"
85176,gussser,2007-06-18 21:55:00,85,Here in Pa we have a lot of horse power restricted lakes.  I fish THEM as much as possible. No problem on them. Other lakes are unrestricted so on them I feel its THEIR lake & let the jet Ski- & power boaters have a wide birth.
85363,holdfast,2007-06-19 05:02:00,1813,"I was taught to always slow down to pers fishing or paddling, swimming etc.  Also to keep my distance to other boaters.  Channel or no channel.  There is just too many stupid, ignorant, and its me , myself and I attitudes.  This is a no brainer thread.  Common courtesy should prevail.  Yea last week I was trolling in a meandering river between 2 lakes and this Idiot cut my line not even looking or slowing down. Could of ran me over if I was in a canoe."
