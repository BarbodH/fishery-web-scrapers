Maureen"

Greencoachdog hit the 400 at daybreak from Toronto, and should be enjoying a cool sparkling beverage right about now with Joe and Art.  I can't see how this could possibly help with those ants in pants, but, there ya go."
85037,tjsa,2007-06-18 17:57:00,1578,"Personally, I am probably not going to be there until mid thursday now. Am attending a funeral tuesday afternoon(was supposed to leave at 10 am tuesday morning). Now, I will not leave until wednesday morning. I might get up early wednesday, and drive straight through the 12 hrs., but I doubt it.  Sent a message to the lakair e-mail address about this also, hope the southern contingent gets the message a.s.a.p.  Tom"
