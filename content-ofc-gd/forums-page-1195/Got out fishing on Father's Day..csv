Set the alarm for 4:00am so I could beat the heat and make lunch with my own dad, but I was so tired, I didn't realize the alarm was never turned on.  At 6:00am I rolled out of bed. Tried to wake up the kids, but they were tired and never heard me calling them. The gear was ready, so I threw some stuff in the truck and away I went. Alone for my father's day fishing trip.  Only fished a couple of hours on L. Ontario. 2 small chinooks and 1 sweet bow for my efforts. Hope to get out there again soon.    "
