85166,easton13th,2007-06-18 21:41:00,371,A little late posting. Last weekend I caught this sheephead while trolling the BOQ. What a fight. 19.8lbs A little disappointed to find out it was a sheephead but it was exiting to land it for sure.      Easton
85167,fishindevil,2007-06-18 21:45:00,6254,"Thats a huge freshwater drum thats for sure!!!!!!!!     man way to go,i bet he put up a great fight,they just dont give up,thats one of the biggest ones i have ever seen.....cheers"
85170,Roy,2007-06-18 21:48:00,13728,"Man that's huge, WTG! The Ontario record is 20.6 lbs."
85171,xrap,2007-06-18 21:49:00,683,I know how it feels. I thought I had a big walleye on at Dunnville Dam and as it got closer I saw the silver flash of a football and it sucked!!! Evene a big cat would be nice but those dam sheephead are good for nothing. Thier not even in the OFC tourney!!
85174,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-18 21:52:00,0,"WOW!That must have really put up a nice scrap! Were you long lining, dypsy diving, down rigging, lead lining??  My buddy has yet to catch his first sheephead. I wanna take him to the grand river one day but BOQ would be better!"
85175,Roy,2007-06-18 21:53:00,13728,"But they offer up a pretty decent fight though, XRap  ps. I just looked at the picture again and it almost looks like a grouper doesn't it?"
85177,misfish,2007-06-18 21:55:00,29133,Steamed and they are like lobster tails. So I have heard.  Nice brute E.
85178,Roy,2007-06-18 21:57:00,13728,"Brian, with enough garlic butter, even Corn Flakes will taste like lobster."
85179,Mike the Pike,2007-06-18 21:57:00,3421,Wow Fred looks look like you must of had a great battle from what I hear those things pull like a run away freight train.  Thanks for the Pic  MTP
85182,xrap,2007-06-18 21:59:00,683," Yep sure do. Although when I go perching I always see different people keep them and when I mean keep them I mean the'll be hundreads laying all over the pier. I know you can keep a couple for your garden but every weekend with that much fish, come on. I wonder what they do with them   edit: I took the liberty of editing your post as I know you did not mean to generalize as to which racial group was keeping fish."
85191,misfish,2007-06-18 22:08:00,29133, Ok Im taking the 5th for the rest of the night.
85192,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-18 22:08:00,0,"You dont have to worry about sheephead populations going down on the grand. When I took my boat up there, the fishfinder was lit up like a christmas tree. That place is infested with sheep head. We didn't go more than 10 minutes without hooking one. Too bad there weren't any really large ones. It did get a little boring after awhile, though my dad had a blast.  Apparently they do taste good if you know how to cook them.  Plus if they clean out all the sheephead you wont be complaining about catching sheephead.lol"
85202,xrap,2007-06-18 22:37:00,683, I didn't really mean it that way. Sorry if I offended anyone and thanks Roy for editing as it could of started another argument. I aplogize and I'll take the time to read my comments before I post next time.
85248,easton13th,2007-06-19 00:04:00,371,Amazing fight ran away and dove to the bottom several times! All in all about 10 minutes to land. I have tried them they taste along the same lines as shrimp to me but chewy like gum.  I landed it while trolling for walleye with a spinner. 10lb test on a baicaster so fight it or lose it. What a blast it was.  Easton
85257,nel,2007-06-19 00:30:00,52,"I've been told by my friends that they make excellent fishballs.  You just grind it up and turn it into a meatball...then you cook it in soup and noodles (vietnamese noodles or chinese wonton style). I was hoping to try it out once, but I saw some kind of leech or parasite hanging out under the gill plate...and then I didn't feel like trying it anymore."
85270,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-06-19 01:06:00,0, Thanks for the info!
85360,Rich,2007-06-19 04:36:00,3927,"Funny, last time Sleded and I were in Dunnville we couldnt catch a sheephead for the life of us. Cats by the millions, a limit of walleye.. no sheepies. Heck we were even trying to catch them for a while, lol Did see about a 10lber caught by a shore angler though.  That 19lber is humungous!"
85361,sturgman,2007-06-19 04:44:00,249,"Yeah that's a huge sheepshead. I remember as a kid casting off the Cache Bay docks a friend of mine nailed one on light gear, it eventually fried his spinning reel but was able to hand line it in.  Theres a beautiful jewel in there heads, anyone ever see em?"
85362,xrap,2007-06-19 04:59:00,683,"Here's one of my bigger sheepies from Dunnville, no where near yours though Easton.  "
