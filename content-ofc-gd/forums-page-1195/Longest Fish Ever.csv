85193,cisco,2007-06-18 22:09:00,597,"With all the blood clumps on the hand in the first pic, along with the results of the second pic, maybe we shouldn't assume the critter was released...... not that there is anything wrong with that!  Nice musky!"
85206,muskymax,2007-06-18 22:42:00,21,"Ya that one was not released, it was the biggest musky I ever caught but my friend caught this Striped Bass and he released it.  It was huge!!!    There are more pics of this beast in the gallery: http://www.bountyfishing.com/gallery/this-is-how-we-do-it  Just to time consuming to upload them all one by one"
85215,drufis,2007-06-18 23:05:00,45,"Sorry  Musky Max not sure if I got it the first time, what is that website again?  Just kidding, I think?"
85228,muskymax,2007-06-18 23:27:00,21,"LOL, just making sure.  What kind of fish do you normally go after?"
85309,Roy,2007-06-19 02:14:00,13728,I have to add that you look exactly like Mike Lazarus. In fact....the picture IS Mike Lazarus.
85312,Stoty,2007-06-19 02:15:00,2910,This thread reminds me of popularity contests back in highschool. Good excuse to link your site to this one. Speaking of that site..... someone should think about a re-design. lol
85339,OhioFisherman,2007-06-19 03:03:00,6623,"LOL, longest a Gar pike, end to end I guessed about 45-46 inches, pike and carp heavier. 22 inch golden rule in the boat, LOL I would like to feel the need to measure bigger bass!"
85358,muskymax,2007-06-19 04:22:00,21,"well i found this picture in another forum, supposedly this Longnose gar is 19lbs-7ozs and 58 inches long."

85485,LeXXington,2007-06-19 15:00:00,1928,"What was the web sight again, I can't seem to see it at the top advertisement bar.  Unfortuantly, I only measure to check for slot or size limit, use to be weight only.  Guess that means I have not caught anything like MrEH, WOW nice fish BTW.  Oh well,"
85504,Guest mistyriver1,2007-06-19 15:33:00,0,"Mike, like Roy said post that baby any time.....  How's this ???     ps.  Photoshop at work sorry....."

85097,John,2007-06-18 19:32:00,2956,"Roy is a God? I had heard rumours.................  Hey MuskyMax, we get a little suspicious of posts that blatantly promote other sites when the member is new to us. We are quite harmless if you would like to stick around and tell us about yourself without plugging your site...."
