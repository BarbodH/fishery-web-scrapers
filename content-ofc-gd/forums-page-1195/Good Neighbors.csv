85197,Bernie,2007-06-18 22:25:00,3190,My Neighbor called me at work this morning telling me he had a strange noise on acceleration in his Nissan Frontier. Being really busy at the time I said I would stop by later and take it for a test drive to see if it was serious. Just after lunch I took it for a spin and discovered it was only an exhaust heat shield vibration. A bay was empty when I got to the shop and pulled it in. A hose clamp around the shield did the trick to eliminate the vibration.  I took it back and left it in his driveway. He called later and asked what we had done to repair it and how much was the charge. Now my Neighbor is a fine fella with a wife and two very young kids. I didnt charge him anything. Just  before supper he came over with 2 bags containing 2 specked trout in each bag. I didnt expect anything from him at all but this I could hardly refuse. I am so grateful to have good neighbors and to live in a great community. If the world today was just a little more giving we would live much better lives. Just feeling a little reflective tonite and thought I would share
85199,misfish,2007-06-18 22:31:00,29133,Yep I enjoyed snow blowing all the local good nieghbors drives/walkways in the winter.I would find a case of cold ones or a bottle even baseball tickets to the jays at my door. I did it as a good nieghbor and gave thier backs a break and expected nothing in return. Good deeds breed good deeds.  Good on ya for your kindness Nip.
