85597,mikeymikey,2007-06-19 18:48:00,376,"Hello.  I am just wondering if anyone know any updated informations regarding dead carps at Lake Scugog.  Also, are fishing bad for other type of species from entire lake?  I am sure someone must have still fished the lake recently, no ?"
85608,Davis Battah,2007-06-19 19:06:00,31,"Fishing remians great on Scugog.  Was out yesterday afternoon and had 6 Muskie in 3.5 hours.  Biggest was 47"" and the smallest was 40""  The problem with the Carp on Scugog for now is effecting the carp only.  That is not likely to change.  Unfortunate nonetheless.  Get out there and fish!"
85614,Terry,2007-06-19 19:11:00,14456,"it was not  great 2 weeks ago..for the first time in about six years, I didn't get at lest  limit of walleye fishing scugog and to tell the truth I got skunked......along with everyone else we saw"

85690,fishergirl72,2007-06-19 20:55:00,455,"Well i talked to a few of my fellow friends[fishermen] at my local tackle store and they have been doing very well....one of the best years they have had for along time,lots of walleyes and they said that muskies were biting big time with at least 2 every trip and they are only fishing for walleyes....so there you go...good-luck    p.s. do your homework before going...like check out maps,wind,weather,timing"
85694,urbanangler1990,2007-06-19 21:16:00,933,"hey i wouldnt know how th bite is, lil off topic here, but can u catch musky from the shores?"
85705,ccmtcanada,2007-06-19 21:50:00,7971," I've seen a guy land 2 from shore in Scugog in one night...some pretty nice sized one....36 inch plus!  After seeing him do that, I started to try....NADA!! LOL."
85716,Zamboni,2007-06-19 22:15:00,235,I haven't seen muskie caught from the common Scugog shore fishing spots....7A causeway etc. Guess you have a chance....next time out I'll watch for spots near road access on island.
85771,fliptheslop,2007-06-20 00:34:00,112,"It seems to be only effecting the carp, but im sure the reason for that is that THERE ARE NO OTHER FISH IN SCUGOG lol"
