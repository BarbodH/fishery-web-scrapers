The lakes is situated in the Adironack Mountain range about a 7 hour drive from Toronto.  We launched at about 5:20 and headed out to fish blindly, must have been alright because I had a fish in 5 minutes.  Ended up landing 23 keepers (12 inches +) today and might have had about 11 pounds for our biggest 5 fish.  We watched two local weigh-ins from other club tournaments, and to our surprise on 10.10 pounds won the first and 11.2 won the second.  Apparently 12 or 13 pounds is BIG weight for this lake as it is better known for numbers than size.  Big fish for the weekend that we saw was 2-14, I had a 2-11.  Sunday was slow as a big front had come through but in 5 hours, we managed 11 keepers for about 9 pounds.  Then reality hit and we had to come home.  Would have posted sooner, but I have not been feeling well.                          Good Fishin'"
