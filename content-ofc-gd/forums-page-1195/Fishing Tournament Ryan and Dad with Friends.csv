84798,Mike the Pike,2007-06-18 03:47:00,3421,After last weekends fishing tournament being the 2nd time out being SKUNKED I finally barely killed the skunk .This day was another great day with my young Son and my fishing partner Ryan (8).The day was not filled with trophy fish but with lasting memories.Once again mother nature gave us a beautiful day.I can not describe the kind of day Ryan enjoyed.I must say simply priceless.For some of you who have seen my previous reports well Ryan has endured many treturous weather outings with rain and cold .This day was one of our best.  Got out with GlennK and his son Andrew who enjoyed his day just as much as Ryan.Andrew out fished his old man landing a couple of pike.  Enough said on with the pics.   First pic of the day7:45am and Ryan Says hurry up Dad the sun is shining in my face.I just love the facial expression.    A shot of GlennK and his 12 year old son Andrew.   Ryan's first up real close observation of a snot rocket pike.   Ya I know thats a dink but after the last 2 trips the skunk is gone.   Another Dink snot rocket but Ryan was impressed.   Redneck fisherman.A little father and son fun   First time piloting the boat with the electric.   Trolling for the sleeping pike with the 4 stroke.Won't be long and will be able to kick back with the young captain in command.     These are 2 of my fishing buddies Danny and Kenny who fish the opening every year with me in Quinte. When I caught up with them Kenny(on the right) had just taken a dip in 6ft of water trying to find his rod and reel he accidently kicked over board trying to get the rod out of a snag.Yup Kenny stripped down to his underwear and tried to find the rod which he never found    by by Rod$$$$$$$$$  After a little shrinkage he called Danny over the water temp was just too cold for Rod recovery.  By the Way Danny came in third place for Pike during the tournament with a 33 inch pike 1 1/4 shy of first palce     Around Lunch time Ryan and I were looking for a place to dock and have lunch but as you can see there was a helluva line up at the dock.   2 more friends of ours Clifford and his son Mike.The bridge in the backgound is the USA.We were a 1/4 mile from the Quebec Canada US border. This is where Danny caught the 33 inch Pike sorry Danny forgot his camera.   Who said the sunfish was mighty.The little pea brain is down right stupid this is a rapala 6 inch Husky Jerk the sunfish is about 4 inches and I have no idea what this thing was thinking.How the hell is it supposed to digest something 2 inches longer than itself Yup the worlds dummest fish and yes sunfish are nothing but pigs     Many times during the day we caught some pretty good size boat wake and Ryan thought it was cool slamming in to some 4ft plus waves.Boys will be boys.   Here you go Glen(Green Coach Dog)you wanted skin pics so here you go this is my Redneck suntan   Oh and Glen this is how you should dress in your rental TILLER boat which will be lacking the tracker side console.It was 29 celcius and I know you think that is cold up here .Good Luck Glenn and beware of those cold Northern air cold fronts  in Lakair.   This was a draw prize at the tournament.Also another draw for a 2hp Honda.   Our gang for the day .We were just missing Clifford's son Mike.A little of what we won from draw prizes.   I had to take this shot I have never seen an aluminium boat this small before.   The ride home.   Surprize!!!!!!!!   The 4:45am wake up time took its toll on my young man .  What a day ya I know no trophy fish but we enjoyed our Father's Day weekend.  MTP
