84818,jediangler,2007-06-18 06:40:00,1923,"Returned to Sturgeon lake and fished the same area I fished 2 weeks ago on the opener. Started at 6am and fished till 8am. Caught this 29""er at 7:30am on a Mepps musky killer bucktail in about 7ft of water. Put up a good fight and soaked me when I got it beside the yak.  Then I threw the yak back on the roof of my car and headed over to Pigeon lake. I was hoping to go two for two in Kawartha musky lakes. I fished behind Big island from 9:30am till noon without so much as a follow. Packed up and went home to KW, putting 560km on the car round trip. That's 3 muskies this year so far but all of them under 30"". Has anyone caught muskies in more than one Kawartha lake in one day? I guess getting one in Pigeon and one in Buckhorn in the same day is probably not that unusual. Or maybe Buckhorn and Chemong. Just wondering. I see this week in the Crappy tire flyer that my kayak is on sale again for $299 down from $349. You can't find a cheaper fishing machine anywhere. Add $100 for a paddle and another $100 for a good PFD and a car top carrier kit and you're ready to fish almost anywhere."

85040,tbayboy,2007-06-18 17:58:00,1497,"Thats awesome Jedi, the 'yak dealers should be sponsoring you.  On a related note, have you tried using the sit on top kayaks at all?  You (and reports from others) have me browsing/googling around the kayak fishing sites and the options are blinding me so any advice you might have would really be appreciated."
85055,tonyb,2007-06-18 18:14:00,1637,Do you just roll over to do your figure-8's?  Hold your breath!! Tony
85267,jediangler,2007-06-19 00:53:00,1923,Thanks all. I'll have to try that inverted figure 8 idea tonyb. TbayBoy I have tried a sit on top but it was a tandem. I plan on renting one from Adventure Guide in Waterloo for bass opener.
85276,MuskyBill,2007-06-19 01:16:00,311,"Always a great report, Jedi, thanks!"
85330,danbo,2007-06-19 02:43:00,2646,"Good job, Jedi. Those SOT type kayaks are butt-soakers for warm waters. The Sit-In type allows you to stay dry with a fitted spray-skirt, great for early/late season when water is cold. You have to buy a kayak by the Weight/size of the paddler & specific use..fish or tour or whitewater,etc. Rent first or you may be sorry with your purchase. I'm 6'5  & 290..I bought an Old Town ""Twin Otter"" & removed the rear seat to carry my tacklebox behind me & camera drybox up under the bow. AquaBound MantaRay is the perfect paddle for pushing a load without flex or blade flutter. Once Yak..never look back!!"
85346,Kev,2007-06-19 03:28:00,54,Good show.    Muskies in a kayak eh.....hmmm i think i'll stick to the boat. good report and nice pic.
