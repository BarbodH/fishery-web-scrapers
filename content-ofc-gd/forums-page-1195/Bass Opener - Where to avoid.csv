85732,Big Cliff,2007-06-19 23:02:00,6899,I don't target bass at all unless I am with someone that wants to fish for bass but my neighbour is an avid bass fisherman. I was talking to him last night and he was telling me the bass fishing in Sturgeon Lake is the worst he has seen it in 15 years! He hasn't been specifically fishing bass yet this year (season isn't open yet) but he usually gets quite a few when he is fishing walleye and this year even the walleye fishing is really slow. So I would guess Sturgeon Lake would be a good place to avoid for now.
85738,fishinfool,2007-06-19 23:19:00,366,"Hey kevin I did the Pikemania series over the last 3 weekends and I heard that the CSFL is having their Bass Tournament out of Orillia this coming weekend and that there will be approximately 150 boats. They will be all over Simcoe so you might want to try one of the other great lakes like Balsam, Pigeon or Buckhorn to satisfy your itch. Good Luck and take lots of pics no matter where you go.

85741,Handlebarz,2007-06-19 23:30:00,3790,LSC has a couple bass tourneys this weekend so it will be a mad house.  We also have our Belle River chapter outing for MCI the Can/AmChallenge so there will be alot of people out a big lake forshure but alot of people will be there I cant wait bring them on.
