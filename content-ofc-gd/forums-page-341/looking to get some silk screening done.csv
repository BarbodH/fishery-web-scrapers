755666,Canuck2fan,2013-01-01 17:57:00,1444,If you want to do it online I have used both of these sites... I got exactly what I ordered from both for the price quoted. Vistaprint had cheaper shipping at the time I used them. Shirt quality was slightly higher from Printfection.  http://www.printfection.com/  http://www.vistaprint.ca/t-shirts-multi-product.aspx?dr=1&GP=1%2f1%2f2013+12%3a46%3a47+PM&GPS=2690834382&GNF=1

755710,cheaptackle,2013-01-02 00:40:00,849,Not sure exactly what you might want but here in Orillia Artech Promotional Wear is the big daddy in town.  I believe their silk screening is an in house effort (I used to know a guy that worked there doing it) but things do change.  Michael
