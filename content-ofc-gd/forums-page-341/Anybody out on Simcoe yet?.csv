756048,Lunker777,2013-01-03 15:12:00,866,"I'm thinkin with the -8 weather for the next couple days , any ice that is there will have built up a bit more . If more people are fishing it today, I would think it's good to go this weekend"
756049,Terry,2013-01-03 15:18:00,14456,"for sure, it's safe enough for me...but everyone has their own level of comfort"
756051,BillM,2013-01-03 15:22:00,17367,"Really windy today boys, keep that in mind.   Wind doesn't help ice production."
756053,TJQ,2013-01-03 15:30:00,7806,"  Hmmmfff you girls and your ""inches"" .. can never make you happy!"
756060,Terry,2013-01-03 15:45:00,14456,bazinga
756063,iFish4real,2013-01-03 15:47:00,386,anybody ever used those Ken's Hooks on Simcoe? wondering if it's worth buying some...
756064,Terry,2013-01-03 15:50:00,14456,"they look like other lures that work well, so I would suspect they will work but had never seen that make before"
756067,Thrilla,2013-01-03 16:01:00,164,Ken's hooks = yes
756100,cityfisher,2013-01-03 19:42:00,959, the good ol days  driving for 30 mins on crack ridden simcoe for a couple whities
756154,bobowski,2013-01-03 23:45:00,360,I didnt manage to get out today as my fishing partner was sick. I will however be going out tomorrow for sure. I will post a report for all of you weekend warriors.
756181,lickmyarmpit,2013-01-04 01:07:00,359,I'll be going out tomorrow too hoping that I'm not wasting my gas money. From what I heard there's six inches.......(insert that what she said joke here). Will post a report when I get back.

756355,lickmyarmpit,2013-01-04 19:21:00,359,"There's ice but not much, really windy glad I rented a hut. Couple dozen fellas decent fishing."
756374,misfish,2013-01-04 20:53:00,29133," Not to stir the pot,but whos renting huts on thin ice? Is there not a clause about  amount of ice,to have huts out? Insurance reasons.  Just asking"
756384,BucktownAngler,2013-01-04 21:20:00,582, pm sent
756386,misfish,2013-01-04 21:25:00,29133,Thanks Boss
756443,tapout,2013-01-05 00:12:00,166,Looks like alot of us OFNers are gonna be there tomorrow.  Good luck and be safe!
756465,lickmyarmpit,2013-01-05 01:25:00,359,There's a good six inches stick to the trails. Careful out there tomorrow if anyone goes. Parking tickets for parking on the street just a heads up. Here's a few pics from the cell.  king can was the measuring tape for the day anything smaller went back  suprise pike on super light gear (4lb test) ate a two inch minnow on a 1\16 jig
755843,iFish4real,2013-01-02 20:43:00,386,anybody knows if ice is safe anywhere? forgot to mention...some place for perch fun  tx!!!
755846,Terry,2013-01-02 20:48:00,14456,"  Virginia Beach has good ice, but come the weekend it will be crowded"
755847,Guest,2013-01-02 20:48:00,0,"I heard Gilford is at 2 inches.  Not ready yet, but its coming soon.   OOOOHHHHHH YAAAAAAA"
755852,misfish,2013-01-02 20:59:00,29133," Not where Im going,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oh wait,it might be.LOL"
755855,davey buoy,2013-01-02 21:02:00,5505,"I heard Cooks Bay 1.5"",next weekend for sure!. Unsafe now!"
755887,Joey,2013-01-02 22:30:00,9122,"Don't forget, ice varies.  It was New Years day 2008 or 2009 that Terry, Paul and I went out on Cook's Bay and I caught that huge carp.  The ice was 4 to 5 inches in most spots, but one spot we were on it was only 2""  Use your heads and be safe!"
755894,Terry,2013-01-02 22:39:00,14456," 2008  hope we can do it again   not the thin ice ,but the ice fishing"
755899,misfish,2013-01-02 22:53:00,29133,"All I know is this. If you all are going deep,you better have room on a sled. I aint walking 5 mile.  EDIT,,,,  I got to get Betty out as well this year.  Laker fishing in a boat,is soooo much nicer."
755904,bobowski,2013-01-02 23:06:00,360,Im planning on going to Virginia Beach tomorrow. I've seen video reports of 5 inches although it varies in spots. I will be following the crowds and spudding my way out just to be safe. I will report my findings and Jumbos (hopefully) tomorrow.
755922,Terry,2013-01-02 23:46:00,14456, we will draw you a map and drop you off supplies  lol  I am sure we can squeeze you in
755926,BillM,2013-01-02 23:56:00,17367,I can't find Slyville on the map!
755931,iFish4real,2013-01-03 00:27:00,386, what's in Slyville?
755933,BillM,2013-01-03 00:38:00,17367, Lake Simcoe has many secrets!
755934,Terry,2013-01-03 00:41:00,14456,"it is a spot in the middle of simcoe that had great whitefish fishing one year and Sly, (RIP) was the great guy that found the spot and lead people to it"
755935,iFish4real,2013-01-03 00:43:00,386, haha...good one  I would have named it Slyhole though
755940,NAW,2013-01-03 01:02:00,4022,I always thought slyville was just what ever location Sly had his hut in that year  Drove past a few time and seen his quad outside.  Should have stopped in.  Always kick myself for not stopping.
755942,BillM,2013-01-03 01:07:00,17367," It changed every year, lol."
755943,Terry,2013-01-03 01:12:00,14456,"well yeah ,but it was the one year with the gps points given to everyone that made it famous"
755945,BillM,2013-01-03 01:22:00,17367, All you had to do is follow the flock!  LOL!   Slammed the whities out there like crazy.
755947,Terry,2013-01-03 01:31:00,14456,"or the blood trail, it looked like a killing field out there"
755949,Joey,2013-01-03 01:43:00,9122," Oh we'll definately be doing it again Terry, as soon as the ice is good out there.  Paul had the auger going last weekend and was doing a ""trial run"" of what fits where in the snowmobile trailer with our huts etc.  PM's will be flying soon"
755951,Joey,2013-01-03 01:43:00,9122," Ya, what Terry said, we'll find a spot for yous no prob"
756005,steelhedrmatt,2013-01-03 12:03:00,278," I remember the day Sly found that spot.  He came and grabbed Iceguy and myself from Iceguys hut. Said ""lets go, we found the fish.  Tommys out there now."" It was one of the best days ive ever had out there.  The next weekend he pulled all his huts out there, and for the rest of the season, it was a zoo. I still go out there from time to time, but the fishing has never been as good as that day.  Heres the video from the day he found that spot.  Lots of good days remembered with Sly.  Miss ya Buddie!!   "
756042,Lunker777,2013-01-03 15:01:00,866,"Looking to get out on the ice this weekend , my dad is here from Vancouver and has till Monday afternoon . Do you think Virginia beach would be a good bet ? Heading out Friday afternoon to fish Saturday and Sunday and we would be driving 4 hours . I don't want to make the trip if the ice isn't safe . Weather reports look good for the next few days ... Thanks for any advice"
756046,Terry,2013-01-03 15:06:00,14456,VB is the safest spot on simcoe right now.... but only you can tell if it is safe enough for you.....lots of people fishing it
