We didn't do the large Christmas village this year as neither of us had the time, energy nor even the space for it. But here are a few pics that J took this afternoon for me to archive for next year. She asked me to send them to my friends.  http://s300.beta.pho...9a3aec.jpg.html"

755919,lew,2013-01-02 23:39:00,12766,"The old homestead is lookin pretty festive there Roy, and I still remember the great supper we had at that dining room table many moons ago.  You should also give the crew a close-up look of some of your art work, it's more than impressive !!"

I can say I've had a few delicious meals at that very table myself  I agree tho, you need a few more close ups of your spectacular paintings    And, tell the truth, how much Christmas stuff DIDN'T J put out this year, a closet full, I now she has more"
756185,Leecher,2013-01-04 01:26:00,7832,"Wish I could say the same about decorations in our home this year... spent family time at the hospital and didn't have time at all to even put up a single light, decoration or tree for that matter  Our family's gift exchange (wife, daughter and I) happen on December 26th, early in the morning (2h00 - 2h30am) and when we woke up, wife went back to see her dad and late in the afternoon, FIL took his last breath  You have a beautiful place Roy   Grand kids must of been very happy to be there with you guys!  Thanks for sharing Jacques"
