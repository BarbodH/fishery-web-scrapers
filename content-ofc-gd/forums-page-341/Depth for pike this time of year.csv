756103,Freshtrax,2013-01-03 20:01:00,2215,Once the ice is safe what depth should I start targeting pike at through the ice in cooks bay?  Any particular kind of structure they like in the winter?  Any general tips appreciated.   Perch just don't do it for me .
756104,TJQ,2013-01-03 20:05:00,7806,Oh... here we go... one of those elitest pike fishermen. LOL
756107,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-03 20:19:00,10439,Start in 10-15 FOW.
756109,BillM,2013-01-03 20:22:00,17367,"Find the edges, transitions and you'll find the pike."
756110,Freshtrax,2013-01-03 20:28:00,2215, I hate the slimy things.  Much rather be sitting on 65-110 fow.
756111,misfish,2013-01-03 20:30:00,29133," Good one Bill.  I like to start in about 20-25 fow,looking for green weeds. This time of year you can still find it.And fish the edge."
756113,Leecher,2013-01-03 20:39:00,7832,Don't be afraid to explore the 4' to 5' range... use biggest golden shiner on a quick strike rig and set your drag accordingly... you should be golden
756510,chris f.,2013-01-05 05:23:00,95,"you would be surprised how shallow pike will go for food. bait fish get caught in pockets along shore and freeze up in the ice. when it rains or as the season progresses, they thaw out and are preserved so the pike home in on them. monster pike have been pulled out of 2 feet of water on Lake of the Woods and Devils Lake using dead minnows on a simple tip up rig. this shallow water approach works in many different types of water systems"
