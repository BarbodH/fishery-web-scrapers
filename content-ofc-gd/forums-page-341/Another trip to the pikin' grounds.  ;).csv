755707,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-02 00:26:00,10439,"Got out again today. Temps were awesome nearly warmed up to -10!!!! Hit the trail at sunrise. It was nice and quiet as most of last nights party goers were fast a sleep as it was only 10:15.    Got to my spot    and started making some holes        Even managed to catch a few fish, but no brutes today. Several fish in the 30""-32"" range and about a dozen smaller fish.            Time to pack er up and head home    Into the evening sunset @ 3:15 Fished the whole day fron sun up to sun down.    :tease:  "

755715,Christopheraaron,2013-01-02 00:59:00,3525,You're horribly spoiled if you don't think those are brutes!
755718,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-02 01:11:00,10439," I am!!!! I don't start to get excited until they reach the 40"" mark."
755756,spinnerbaitking,2013-01-02 11:41:00,1622,"Nice, I've only ever caught 1 - 40"" pike lol Tight Lines SBK"
755758,Rich,2013-01-02 12:38:00,3927,"Lol, thats like saying you're spoiled if 1.5 lb bass aren't what you consider trophies.  Either way, super jealous! They may not have been that big but you were pulling fish out of a hole, something some of still dont have the chance to do yet!"
755789,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-02 15:55:00,2690,"  I hear you Rich!!  Hopefully soon!  For now we get to live vicariously through Dave and the northern Ontario boys!!  Nice fish, and, rig!!"

755956,Rod Caster,2013-01-03 02:16:00,5784,awesome. I think I'd have to trade in my hand auger if I ever moved up there.
755965,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-03 03:06:00,10439, NAH!!! I still use mine at first ice. Nice and light when you're walking on.
755966,Joey,2013-01-03 03:07:00,9122,Sun up to sun down  Great report and some nice Jack there
756196,Leecher,2013-01-04 01:59:00,7832,Nice going Dave    Looks like you have plenty of safe ice all around you    That yellow pike sure looks odd to me
756205,limeyangler,2013-01-04 02:27:00,5204,Nice one Dave. Great black ice you have there....we have about half the ice you have....but enough for 1/2 tons so its all good.
