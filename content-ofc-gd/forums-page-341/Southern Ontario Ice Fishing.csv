755792,Broker,2013-01-02 16:14:00,482,"Hey guys. Havnt checked in for awhile. Anyways, got an icefishing setup for christmas, and now I'm eager to get out and try it. Yes I know the Ice isnt ready down here but I was just looking for some places within an hours drive of caledonia to drop a line in and catch whatever bites. Also what gear I should pick up before I head out. Thanks."
755801,Christopheraaron,2013-01-02 16:44:00,3525,"Talk to Steve (fishmaster), sounds like the grand around dunnville is almost there."
755820,Musky or Specks,2013-01-02 18:39:00,2710,"Also where the Fishathon is held, if it ever freezes can be quite good for various species."
755826,asdve23rveavwa,2013-01-02 19:39:00,2690,"  Panfish only through the ice.  So, perch, bluegill and crappie in case anyone is wondering."
755830,Rich,2013-01-02 19:55:00,3927,Deer creek freezes last.. mid jan if you're REALLY lucky.
755871,Broker,2013-01-02 21:54:00,482,Hey guys just thought about a creek that runs off the grand that I fish often in the summer by my house.. Its frozen.. And its about 5 feet deep. Would it be worth trying?
756062,Rich,2013-01-03 15:47:00,3927,Could be....?
756083,Musky or Specks,2013-01-03 17:29:00,2710,yes trout and bass are closed
756084,Musky or Specks,2013-01-03 17:31:00,2710,Saw someone ice fishing little lake yesterday around 3pm
756461,vinnimon,2013-01-05 01:11:00,2593,Which one? The one up by barrie or the one in cambridge?
756462,Christopheraaron,2013-01-05 01:13:00,3525, I'm almost certain he meant cambridge.
756463,vinnimon,2013-01-05 01:15:00,2593,"The grand was starting to freeze over above the dam in caledonia. With this wind, and some mild temps, Its going to be a bit for dunville. No matter about one says, Im extremely cautious in those waters."
756470,Broker,2013-01-05 01:32:00,482,Yeah me too.. Being a hardwater newbie I'm a bit intimidated to go On the grand with those currents that'll change the thickness quickly. Thinking I should find a nice little lake to get expierence on first
756471,Christopheraaron,2013-01-05 01:35:00,3525,Sounds like little lake is your best bet.
756478,vinnimon,2013-01-05 02:03:00,2593,littlelake is a good starting point
756479,Rich,2013-01-05 02:07:00,3927,I've never had near as good a day in dunnville through the ice as i usually do on the smaller lakes. It takes years of experience and effort to catch fish through the ice regularly in dunnville. I have neither. Lol
756481,Broker,2013-01-05 02:11:00,482,"hahaha, Once binbrook has ice I'll head out there  In the mean time i'll make some tip ups and tie some jigs and dream! lol"
756508,Musky or Specks,2013-01-05 05:17:00,2710,Little lake cambridge
