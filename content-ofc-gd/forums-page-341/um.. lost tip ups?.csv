756073,chris f.,2013-01-03 16:52:00,95,"So one of my tip ups vanished today.. one min it was there, the next it was gone.. um, anyone else ever have this happen.. needless to say i didn't go over to check why it was gone, and i gathered up the rest of my gear and headed back to the dock... any ideas?"
756075,mike rousseau,2013-01-03 16:56:00,4661,Big fish have been known to bust tip ups and take em down...  There was a big musky doing it a few years ago locally.... Took a handful  of tip ups before some caught it...  Or maybe a big carp...   ...
756077,Skipper D,2013-01-03 17:03:00,1970,Sure you did'nt have it in your hand and lost it when you dived in with your new float suit .... lol ..
756079,Rod Caster,2013-01-03 17:07:00,5784,"Ah, you skimped out on slush for your tip-up base and a pike/musky swung in and robbed you haha. Happens to the best of us"
756080,camillj,2013-01-03 17:11:00,1988,Yup ... I have watched (ran and dove - but missed) more than once when a big laker has cruised straight through and taken the whole kit and caboudle down the hole ... more than once... they don't always hit 'lightly'
756089,Rich,2013-01-03 18:00:00,3927,"lol memories of my first tip-up, the cod king.. lasted one day.. did pretty well for a homemade contraption.. up til it got a bite anyway."
756091,Musky or Specks,2013-01-03 18:13:00,2710,"Ive lost two rods and reels on stands to fish. One I was lucky enough to catch with a second line, 14 inch crappie still attached and the other I dream was a 8 pound brookie that still, like moby dick swims the deep water trailing my gear behind it."
756092,bare foot wader,2013-01-03 18:23:00,1354,"how much line are guys spooling on their tip ups? how can a fish take it down the hole when it's free spooling?  I have bells on all my flags, even if I'm not watching I can hear it set off...I fill each spool with dacron, I've got there with the shaft spinning and a big laker or pike on a run, but never had a fish come even close to spooling me"
756095,misfish,2013-01-03 18:59:00,29133,"When pike fishing,I use a large branch and a spool of that black cord line.Pike hits,the flag is gone and the spool is spinning in the snow. Works great."
756102,davey buoy,2013-01-03 19:59:00,5505,Some one mentioned tying the base to your auger at one time. I'll be doing that when I can find a fellow or two to get me out:sarcasm:Ready when anyone else is game!
756152,irishfield,2013-01-03 23:40:00,26272,How many of these are you using at a time?
756179,gaspumper,2013-01-04 01:01:00,393,"On some of his other posts he says he has a ""few"" set up about 50 ft.past his dock..I hope he only means 2."
756182,Leecher,2013-01-04 01:12:00,7832,Not sure what kind of tipups you are using but you need to fit them with spools like this to avoid having it go thru the ice when a big fish strikes    You can buy those at Walmart or CTC
756187,chris f.,2013-01-04 01:29:00,95,"i have been catching big catfish off my dock in the summer so could be that one took it down.. i had no bell on the tip up and it was and old wooden one anyway.. i just got worried the hole was giving way lol.. and no, i haven't gone in with the float suit yet  .. i don't really wanna go too far out so i'll wait for a few warm days and do it near shore i think. pics of the new suit and gear to come.. need to find a usb cable for my camera, dogs ate the other one lol"
756188,Rod Caster,2013-01-04 01:29:00,5784, Fixed it for you.  I'll vouch for T.J's tipups! Great for all species.
756189,chris f.,2013-01-04 01:30:00,95, and im gonna test my old one... not the new one. i hope i don't have to get that one wet
756190,Leecher,2013-01-04 01:37:00,7832, Thanks for the props Chad   I was merely speaking of the plastic reels
