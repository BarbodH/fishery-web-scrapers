754543,BillM,2012-12-27 01:49:00,17367,Happens to a lot of cars..  My gf's Murano is suffering from the exact same thing.  I need to pull the rear wiper and 'un-seize' it for a lack of a better word.
754544,Fisherman,2012-12-27 01:49:00,7201,"Second last picture, where the threaded portion and a bit lower looks like a big hex nut,  clean that up and you may find the clip under there. Then you can pull the whole bull out and re grease it with some light weight grease like used for snowmobiles and boat trailer axles. Just a guess but I'm hoping..good luck."

754562,BillM,2012-12-27 04:08:00,17367,"Gotta remember, if you do end up fixing this, you'll do it again and again.   $66 + tax and shipping doesn't sound bad to me."

754564,irishfield,2012-12-27 04:34:00,26272,"Yah.. nothing like using a 5 lb hand sledge, and a cut off wheel in the grinder, to take out leaf spring bolts and cut U bolts.... just to take your mind off things!! LOL  Don't ever buy your wife leaf springs and new shocks for Christmas.. this is what you get to spend Boxing Day doing..."
