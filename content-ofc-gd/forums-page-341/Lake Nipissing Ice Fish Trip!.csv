755999,Nipfisher,2013-01-03 11:03:00,2449,"Fishing should be really good this weekend.    Dobee, maybe posting the cost per person, driving arrangements, and incidentals may help you out?  What about sweetening the deal for a member and charging the additional guys less? Some money is better then 3 guys paying it all.  Have you talked to the outfitter about a smaller bungalow or cottage with day huts? Might be cheaper for 3 guys.  What is the cancellation / re-booking penalty?"
