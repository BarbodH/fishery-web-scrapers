755494,tb4me,2012-12-31 18:15:00,3295,"All four Leafs prospects in the tourney are off to the medal round.. So much for the arguement the Sens fans had on here that the Leafs have no future..Calder cup run last year for the Marlies, Looking real good for it again this year, now these 4 draft picks all lookin good..Im very happy about my Leafs future, its lookin BRIGHT! Oh by the way I say we have a 56 game season started by Jan 12th.. Good time for hockey!"
755505,jedimaster,2012-12-31 19:48:00,3472,Sounds good to me. Go leafs go. Go canada go!!!!
756194,blaque,2013-01-04 01:49:00,2419,Just watching Russia/Sweden replay. The swede goalie didnt touch the puck till 15:00 of the second period. Wow
756200,Slop,2013-01-04 02:06:00,151,I'm cheering for the Swedes...they are always the sleeper and have yet to get the job done.
756203,blaque,2013-01-04 02:22:00,2419,"They looked to be on fire in the first......didn't buy them much as its just a one goal game to start the third. Don't spoil it for me, I don't know who won yet LOL"
756298,blaque,2013-01-04 16:26:00,2419,Get to bed early Friday night!!
756343,uglyfish,2013-01-04 18:26:00,981," yup! cause there's ice fishing to do! I don't really care about a bronze medal. after that embarrassment against the USA I don't really care to watch anymore.  having said that , there's not a bigger fan of thw juniors than I am and ill put the game on and watch it while I get ready to hit the ice"
756359,blaque,2013-01-04 19:36:00,2419,"Understandable, ......but a bronze is still in the medals. Having said that.......if i had a shot at gettin on the ice, Id be skipping the US game for it lol"
756366,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-04 20:01:00,10439, And besides it will be on again a couple of times later in the day!!!
756390,blaque,2013-01-04 21:36:00,2419," Ya, thats how ive been gettin my fix.....had a few spoilers from sports radio and internet though b4 the replay lol"
755190,tb4me,2012-12-30 10:26:00,3295,for anyone interested...   Hockey fans can now register for an opportunity to purchase tickets for the 2015 and 2017 WJC in Canada. Info: http://bit.ly/VcHkIq
755191,lickmyarmpit,2012-12-30 10:27:00,359,You had to mention the leafs and I liked you........lol
755192,lickmyarmpit,2012-12-30 10:27:00,359,Great link btw
755193,tb4me,2012-12-30 11:00:00,3295,Well were leading 2-0 after 40 minutes of play..We need to score more to win this game..I dont expect a 2 goal lead to win this one...
755194,davey buoy,2012-12-30 11:06:00,5505, I think we'll see Canada open it up in the third. That seems to be their trend so far.
755195,tb4me,2012-12-30 11:55:00,3295,"Wow not your typical Team Canada game...I think Subban answered alot of questions this morning..830 tom morn folks! Russia, I say bring it....Way to go boys!!!"
755196,davey buoy,2012-12-30 11:59:00,5505,"That could of easily gone the other way,boys better get with it for tomorrow's mornings game!."
755247,Cookslav,2012-12-30 19:28:00,1457,"Gotta say it... Suban played well, but goalies can have hot and cold streaks and he's not got my confidence yet.  Nice to see some back checking today though...although it defintly showed on the score board. I wonder if that was Spots game plan to control the aggressive American style or if it was just how the cards fell while playing a more skilled team?  Either way to beat the Russians we'll need Suban on his game, and the D are going to need to clear the puck a bit better and the offense better get back inot their groove. You can't beat the Russians 2-1....you can count on them to score 2 or 3 goals. Thats their game....100% offense."
755261,Handlebarz,2012-12-30 21:14:00,3790,Well after staying up until 2:30am watching SOA season 2 I missed the game live but after my morning nap I only caught the third period I'm glad they won. It was a tough last 1:30 with 6/4 nice win Canada.
755263,davey buoy,2012-12-30 21:19:00,5505,"Thinking it could be a rough one against Russia in the morning. Hope I'm wrong!,Let's go Canada!!"
755370,blaque,2012-12-31 03:27:00,2419,Just caught the rebroadcast (avoided all spoilers all day so didn't know who won)  Biggest standout......ya can tell these are just kids on the ice. Some monumentally pea brained decisions made by players on both sides at the end.
755437,Handlebarz,2012-12-31 14:32:00,3790,Now this is agame
755439,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-31 14:35:00,10439,Dang!!! That was a costly penalty huh?
755441,davey buoy,2012-12-31 14:37:00,5505,"Geez,don't count these fellows out,things can change fast,like now.lol."
755443,tb4me,2012-12-31 14:40:00,3295,Wow the Russians are fast...yikes....
755457,tb4me,2012-12-31 15:41:00,3295,"Great game so far.. Wow that boone Jenner had me on my feet, when he single handedly killed the penalty in the Russians own end.Sure am proud to be a Canadian today!"
755459,Handlebarz,2012-12-31 15:50:00,3790,Canada is solid today. This is a great game very little mistakes on either side.  I also know that the NHL needs cheer leaders
755460,davey buoy,2012-12-31 15:52:00,5505, They do too:P.
755467,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-31 16:11:00,10439,The only difference if the NHL had cheerleaders would be their location. Need to have a portable stage that rolled into the zamboni access area so as not having to lose all of those mega dollar ice level seats!!!
755468,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-31 16:16:00,10439,"What say you now, Subban doubters?"
755470,Handlebarz,2012-12-31 16:19:00,3790,Lol you are so right. How could I be that dumb.  Great game well done team Canada
755475,tb4me,2012-12-31 16:25:00,3295,Im one heck of a happy Canadian today! Happy New Year to all! Yes Subban has proven to all he is a golaie to be beat..Wow im in one heck of a great mood!
755477,jedimaster,2012-12-31 16:27:00,3472,Solid game all around suban played solid but the defense kept the the shots on the  perimeter. Suban was solid but only really had one big time save in the second. It'll be interesting to see how russia adjusts if they meet again. Not alot to complain about on either side of the ice.
755478,davey buoy,2012-12-31 16:28:00,5505, I'm sure this is not the last we see of them. We will adjust as well.
755481,jedimaster,2012-12-31 16:36:00,3472,Yep room to improve on both sides its shaping up to be a solid rematch if it happens.
754884,Cookslav,2012-12-29 01:00:00,1457,"That hit was text book clean, and to be blunt... If you watch the replay you'll see he stopped skating towards him about 3' past the blue line....he litterally coasted in there, LOWERED his shoulder, CENTERED his body and rolled through him. Camara didn't charge him...he let up on the gas, aimed and fired. No high forearms, no lift...it was a thing of pure Beauty.  The issue was the kid wasn't paying attention and he got caught. You can't ask that players let up at this level of play ""incase"" someones not paying attention....thats like giving the opposing team a get out of jail free card.  I Agree with Brian here, If it was a Canadian boy I'd be saying the same thing....KEEP YOUR HEAD UP! Thats drilled into us in fundimentals as rule #1 We play a clean but rough game and when its played right...we win I Gaurentee that every player out there in this tournament will be just a little bit more cautious now moving the puck forward in this tourney when they play us, and THAT my freinds....is exsactly what we want."
754886,Cookslav,2012-12-29 01:18:00,1457,"By the way....is anyone else other then me NOT impressed with the Canadian Defence? (or Suban at this point?)  They are shakey...big gaps, problems gelling...I'm not optimistic about them yet. The Offense is doing what they are supposed to, I think thats hard to argue with 15 goals rallied in the last 2 games while getting contributions from 10 guys....that puts them as the number one offensive team in the tournament However... They also have 6 goals against making them the 3rd worst defensive team in the tournament. And lets face it...they played Germany and Slovakia.  It may only be 2 games in but from where I'm sitting....we gots some issues in our own end."
754887,Steve,2012-12-29 01:26:00,2075,"crap, just saw the hit on youtube.  it was one of the cleanest hits i've seen in a while. he glided from just inside the blueline. threw his shoulder.  i guess my biggest fear in all of this comes from this thread.  i'm 30, not young, not old.  i'm not old school, nor new school.  i'm scared that hockey is turning into a pansie sport - but resistance from fans is there.  but you always administer change by starting with the youngest (ie, smoking, drinking and driving, etc).  if guys that are ""new school"" think that check was a bad hit, than I'm afraid what is going to happen to hockey in 10 years from now."
754889,blaque,2012-12-29 01:35:00,2419,"Ugh, U.S. in a lot of penalty trouble early (yes I'm watching the replay and know the end result) lol  They better clean it up going forward"
754890,blaque,2012-12-29 01:39:00,2419,"And holy mackerel, the cheerleaders must be more exhausted than the players, they haven't stopped dancing since the puck dropped!!!!"
754893,Cookslav,2012-12-29 01:55:00,1457," Sounds like we went to the same school of Hockey. One of my favorite coaches once taught us the 5 fundimental rules of hockey ""attitude"" Which to me still give me that pregame chill...  Rule number 1...Keep your head up. Rule number 2...Never let your opponents forget rule number 1. Rule number 3...Thats YOUR puck and you should be mad when they have YOUR puck. Rule number 4...Play with in the rules and mind your temper (there are no good penalties.) Rule number 5...Keep your mouth shut and keep moving, let the coaches do the talking. "
754895,blaque,2012-12-29 02:03:00,2419, Love this
754909,kemper,2012-12-29 03:33:00,2232," I don't think anything there has changed, every coach I ever had gave the same speech.  At the same time we were also constantly drilled with ""no hits to the head"" no matter what the circumstance.  When I was 16 I got ripped from behind, crosscheck-head-glass goodnight. It's not a great time to wake up on a stretcher, so I guess that's why I think twice about any check to the head (opposing playing being a dumbass with his head down or not).  When I played, I'd have just taken the puck from that guy and put it in the back of the net"
754926,misfish,2012-12-29 10:27:00,29133,"  Sometimes,I should of listened to that rule."
754936,Handlebarz,2012-12-29 13:05:00,3790,Twice I only caught the third period and Canada looked good lol.  I have to agree that hit was nice. I don't like the result to either player but this is hockey and its been said many times here keep your head up. Any Canadian player young or old that does not do this has not listened over there career or to Mr. Canada Don Cherry he has talked about this since I was a kid playing hockey and if they have not learned over seas they better buy rockem sockem 1-200.   I'm looking forward to tomorrow's game.
754939,davey buoy,2012-12-29 13:20:00,5505,The one player who gave the head shot rec'd a extra game and will miss tomorrows game at least.
754941,fish_fishburn,2012-12-29 13:25:00,1311,That was a clean hit for sure. The euros dont play a physical game but that doesnt mean they are angels either. They are masters of spearing without getting caught. They will use this on Canada to get retalliation penalties against us. They will also spit in your face during scrums which is very hard for officials to detect. Just a couple of differences in the way they play.
754947,davey buoy,2012-12-29 13:52:00,5505," Lipon's hit got the extra game,not Camara's"
755022,BillM,2012-12-29 20:09:00,17367," Camaras hit wasn't to the head, it was a full body hit.  Absolutely nothing dirty about it at all.  You want to see hits to the head, look what Scott Stevens used to do to guys.  I've been playing defense since I was 3, I would have done the exact same thing.  If someone is stupid enough to be skating up the ice with their head down, they deserve to get rocked.  I'd gladly dish that out every single time."
755028,misfish,2012-12-29 20:20:00,29133,"It,s always us DEFENCE guys,that get the bad raps."
755050,blaque,2012-12-29 21:54:00,2419,So who's getting up at 430AM to watch US vs Canada
755052,davey buoy,2012-12-29 22:04:00,5505," Me!!!,off work for the holidays too long. lol.."
755058,misfish,2012-12-29 22:12:00,29133,"I have a PU @ 7am,so I,ll be up to watch. Should be another classic USA VS CAN game."
755064,blaque,2012-12-29 22:38:00,2419,I may be waiting for the re-broadcast lol. Ill be sure to stay off here to avoid any spoilers lol
755183,lickmyarmpit,2012-12-30 09:52:00,359,wake up it's 1-0
755184,tb4me,2012-12-30 10:08:00,3295,Great game so far! Not to many got up eh..Canada looks solid so far..2-0 baby!
755185,tb4me,2012-12-30 10:12:00,3295,Suban looks great this morning!! This is what we were all hoping for.. Hope he can hold up from here on in!
755186,lickmyarmpit,2012-12-30 10:19:00,359,I was worried about subban in the first two games I'm not anymore.  They're lucky it isn't 4-0
755187,davey buoy,2012-12-30 10:20:00,5505,Woke up in time to catch the last 3 mins of the first period.Looks like a good start!
755188,tb4me,2012-12-30 10:23:00,3295,Great game so far! Ritchie is going to be a great future NHLer.. Tyler Biggs looks just that Bigg. Leafs future sure looks bright..
754448,Handlebarz,2012-12-26 10:20:00,3790,I'm surprised that there is no chatter here about the WJHC starting today. First period down Canada up 2-1 Go Canada Go!!!  I live watching the games and am lucky enough to have the week off to catch most of the games.
754450,Handlebarz,2012-12-26 11:52:00,3790,9-3 first win good game IMO. They did nice work on the sloppy turnovers early and showed that they mean business.
754452,fishindevil,2012-12-26 11:57:00,6254,It will only get better !!!! Go Canada !!
754453,misfish,2012-12-26 11:58:00,29133,
754465,John,2012-12-26 14:43:00,2956,Hope they keep on track. Finland looking strong!
754467,Handlebarz,2012-12-26 15:07:00,3790,Sorry Brian did not see that one from the 20th. I was to busy to even see it.
754468,misfish,2012-12-26 15:12:00,29133," Na worries,I could careless."
754470,Handlebarz,2012-12-26 15:23:00,3790,Lol I feel the same about the NHL but I do love to watch these kids that live the game and have hopes of making the big show.
754471,jedimaster,2012-12-26 15:28:00,3472,The big show that apparently noone cares about.
754475,davey buoy,2012-12-26 16:32:00,5505,The Russians win in OT. Looked the other way for a bit!
754476,kickingfrog,2012-12-26 17:04:00,8333,"It's Germany and a 4am start, eastern time, that is what pvr is for."
754480,Squid,2012-12-26 18:08:00,1656,It is nice to watch the games live Mike!! The team looks good!! Subban was a bit shaky.
754484,wormdunker,2012-12-26 18:34:00,1711,Go Canada!  Notice how crisp their passing was.  Yet they were also successful on numerous occasions to break up the German passing game.  Go Canada Go!
754487,davey buoy,2012-12-26 18:46:00,5505," They did look good,but The Germans are favored last I believe. Let's see how well they perform with a bit stiffer competition?."
754489,Squid,2012-12-26 19:15:00,1656,Team Canada will get better as the team progresses deeper into the tournament. Billington will most probably start in net against the Slovaks.
754490,misfish,2012-12-26 19:15:00,29133,  Nice to see some sense from that game. Wait til they meet stiffer comp.
754830,davey buoy,2012-12-28 20:01:00,5505,"Canada beats Slovakia 6-3, but sure didn't look good till way into the second period. Some rough hits by Canada and a couple game suspensions as well. Looks as though Sunday they will be going with only 10 forwards. Good luck boys,go easy on the rough stuff eh!."
754833,dobee,2012-12-28 20:28:00,301,"Slovakia was all over them the first half of the game... eventually got tired and Canada took advantage.  The Camara hit was clean.. what a nice hit, too bad the Slovakian d-man had his head down, when you play at that level of hockey you should know that you cant put yourself in that position... when you do, its gonna hurt.."
754835,davey buoy,2012-12-28 20:31:00,5505," The one hit was a good hard hit,the other arms up to the head,not so much. Good hockey non the less:good:."
754838,misfish,2012-12-28 20:48:00,29133,"It,s a Canadian game,get over it WORLD hockey."
754858,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-28 22:41:00,10439,"  The G-man was too busy checking his skate laces. I saw that as a clean hit and did not deserve a penalty let alone an ejection. One of the on ice officials even told Camara that it was a clean hit.  The other, the elbow to the head was deserving of a penalty.  Canada needs to step up their game big time. The first period was embarassing and they didn't really step it up until the second half of the second period. They need to play the whole game like that if they want gold."
754861,kemper,2012-12-28 22:48:00,2232," I've played hockey my whole life, and would NEVER step into someone that hard when their head is down. I hope anyone I play against would do the same...  I'm not saying you don't hit the guy, but to blast him shoulder to face at full speed...doesn't seem like the greatest idea.  At the very least, our boys need to remember that the international rules are different - clean or not that is going to get called 100% of the time in IIHF hockey. The stupid penalties need to stop if they want gold."
754869,misfish,2012-12-28 23:19:00,29133,"Hits from behind I cant stand. Coward. But that hit was classice Stevens and CLEAN. If you want to skate with your head down,well then,you get what you get. Heads up. Number one thing we were taught back when. Ya I played along time as well. Back when hockey was hockey. JMO here."
754871,kemper,2012-12-28 23:27:00,2232,"If it was the other way around, and a Canadian boy was getting carted off in a stretcher I bet there would be a lot less ""got what he deserved""...just a thought.  Maybe I'm too new school"
754873,misfish,2012-12-28 23:37:00,29133," Yes,but no disrespect to you and your belief.  Watched enough good hits,and no. If it had been on one of our boys,I would be saying the same thing."
