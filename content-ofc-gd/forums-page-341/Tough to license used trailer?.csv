I'll need to go through the usual with the axles and probably replace tires.  Problem is that it has no ID or papers etc. and a little concerned about getting a license for it.  The gentleman selling it is very upfront and obviously not trying to hide anything.  I have his address, home number, cell number, license plate etc.   Is there a protocol when purchasing to avoid hassles?  Thank you."
