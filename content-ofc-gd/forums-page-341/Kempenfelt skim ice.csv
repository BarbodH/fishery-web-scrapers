756323,Freshtrax,2013-01-04 17:37:00,2215,Looking at the Barrie live cams it looks to have started.  The image it pretty grainy anyone in the area confirm?  How's oro doing?
756327,NAW,2013-01-04 17:45:00,4022,"NICE.  If Kemp is starting to lock up, then the rest of the lake should be starting to be in good shape!"
756338,Freshtrax,2013-01-04 18:12:00,2215,Won't be anytime soon out to the laker grounds that's for sure but if it is skim and we can keep it for the next few days its encouraging
756339,BillM,2013-01-04 18:16:00,17367,Skim with 45km/h winds today?  I'd be surprised if there is any ice at all on the bay.
756347,Harrison,2013-01-04 18:41:00,2202,"I was thinking the same Bill.  If there was any, it's now in Beaverton."
756348,Freshtrax,2013-01-04 18:52:00,2215,I'm just talking right downtown at minuets pt.  and the marina.  Look at the live camera. I didn't believe it either but it damn sure looks like ice.  anyone actually live nearby had a look?
756349,BillM,2013-01-04 18:53:00,17367,"I'll take a drive by tonight and check it out.  If there was any ice starting to form in the bay, that's all been blown down towards the marina/ramp.  Maybe that's what you're seeing."
756351,Freshtrax,2013-01-04 18:58:00,2215,"http://www.barrie.ca/City%20Hall/Webcams/Pages/default.aspx   Yea, it looks iced over.  I wouldn't dare walk on it any time soon but I will take what I can get."
756354,misfish,2013-01-04 19:18:00,29133,Ok I will look on my way over to the bakery.. I know they are fishing in the marina.  Yes it does look skimed in the pic.
756356,Fisherman,2013-01-04 19:22:00,7201,I was there yesterday afternoon and it had not even frozen out past the inner breakwall and there were a lot of wet patches inside the inner harbour.  If it's freezing at this temp with 45km/h wind gusts then science has just been turned on its head.
756370,misfish,2013-01-04 20:21:00,29133,WIDE OPEN
756383,Freshtrax,2013-01-04 21:20:00,2215,Booooooo!   Let a man dream.
756387,misfish,2013-01-04 21:26:00,29133, That will be $2.50 for the fuel.
756400,fishnsled,2013-01-04 22:00:00,3520,  I'll pay for that fuel as it saved me about $60 for the round trip.
756402,misfish,2013-01-04 22:08:00,29133,  Needed buns for the homemade meatball subs.$2.50 was the cost of the buns.LOL  Dec 3rd Not my photo. http://rstorage.filemobile.com/storage/9339652/1085
756438,Freshtrax,2013-01-04 23:51:00,2215,Lol . My dreams are shattered.    I'm headed up to Dorset in about 6 hours
