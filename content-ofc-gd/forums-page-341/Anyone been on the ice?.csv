754857,jedimaster,2012-12-28 22:40:00,3472,Just wondering if anyone has been on the ice in the Apsley/bancroft corridor? Was planning on hitting a small back lake tomorrow.
754865,jayess,2012-12-28 22:53:00,187,"personally, no. i've heard of people venturing on Riddell and Loon call lakes.  Be safe, fish with a friend!"
754882,ciceri,2012-12-29 00:40:00,535,"We were between madoc and bancroft two weeks ago and had 5"" of clear ice on the lake we were on."
754894,jedimaster,2012-12-29 01:58:00,3472,We will be near the loon call area. How did they make out if you recall?
754903,jayess,2012-12-29 02:58:00,187,"they iced one right off the boat launch as soon as they got there, but dead afterwards. might be worth a shot if your destination doesn't pan out."
754904,jedimaster,2012-12-29 02:59:00,3472,"Yah I am remembering the killer walk in the last time and I am thinking I might not want to do it again. haha, feeling a bit lazy. lol"
754911,jayess,2012-12-29 03:39:00,187,"killer walk? you can access it right off of anstruther lake rd (i think that's the name). they've got a beautiful launch right there. unless you mean to suggest that they don't plow that cottage road? my misunderstanding, in any case."
754915,jedimaster,2012-12-29 04:07:00,3472,"Not for looncall, the other lake we were planning on going to. Looncall is no walk at all. Last time I was there though we got skunked and chased off the lake by a huge german sheppard."
754982,jedimaster,2012-12-29 17:22:00,3472,On the ice... no fish so far snowing like crazy glad we brought the pop up. Ended up on looncall. About 3-4 inches of black clear ice.
755098,jayess,2012-12-30 01:35:00,187,"cool, glad to hear you got out. we ventured a little further to a stock laker lake. landed about 8 between the 3 of us."
755141,jedimaster,2012-12-30 03:06:00,3472,"Nice, we stuck near shore inside a bay, the ice was pretty thin away from shore. We only had 2 inches in the middle of the bay so we didn't really want to go out further."
755142,Christopheraaron,2012-12-30 03:09:00,3525,Catch anything?
755145,jedimaster,2012-12-30 03:14:00,3472,Not a thing. Marked a couple cruisers and got stripped by a small ones but no solid hits. We got there pretty late.  I am debating whether or not we got our 2013 skunk out of the way or if our 2012 ended in misery.
755147,jedimaster,2012-12-30 03:19:00,3472,The conditions were less than ideal so I am leaning towards the ice seasons skunk is out of the way.  
755238,jayess,2012-12-30 17:52:00,187,"lol yup that's what our little area looked like... still surprising how strong a few inches can be. not something to be tempted, but impressive. i find the February hardening with its pressure cracks was much more audible, likely suggests that if the ice is gonna go on you in this early season, you won't have much in the way of warning."
755544,jjcanoe,2012-12-31 22:32:00,744,Be careful out there....  Eels Lake Sunday
755545,misfish,2012-12-31 22:58:00,29133,Drinks are for home. Cant say I didnt do stupid stuff back when. Lucky I guess.  Very sad.
755554,jedimaster,2012-12-31 23:23:00,3472,Didn't I just say someone would go through and die on scugog. Just sad. Booze cars and thin ice is just askin for death. We were nervous on foot let alone a jeep.
755557,Christopheraaron,2012-12-31 23:40:00,3525, Wasn't scugog...  Still very sad.
755586,jedimaster,2013-01-01 01:50:00,3472,Yah I know I guess I shoulda said any lake. Reminds me of the family on that side by side rhino that went under on muskoka a few years back. Always so sad and preventable.
