756027,BITEME,2013-01-03 14:32:00,1968,HAPPY NEW YEAR ALL  I have a buddy at work that lives in DUNDALK near Corbetin 4 km west and is looking at options other then dialup can anyone make some suggestions.  Thanks Peter  PS as much as he can get for as little as he can pay
756028,Raf,2013-01-03 14:35:00,3495,"if he's our of reach of cable or dsl (and I suspect he is in Dundalk) his only option is satellite or a wireless provider (bell, rogers, telus, or a local guy who beams does a similar thing)  welcome to the reality of rural high speed internet in canada (3rd world style).  it's expensive and limited.  we're with rogers and their rocket hub 10gb/month for $52 is their current promotion.  10gb/month is peanuts, don't expect to watch any youtube/netflix"
