She was killed by captive wolves inside of a compound.  I have a cottage maybe 9km from where the wolves got out.  I was up there over New Years and did see wolf tracks, 2 together.  Not unusual to see wolf tracks in winter there and once saw tracks inside of my snowshoe tracks from the day before. I've only seen one wolf in 11 years but have heard them while hunting. There is no legal hunting of wolves in WMU 54 in the areas around Algonquin Park, including the Haliburton Forest. The problem with the released captive wolves is that they don't know how to hunt and could interact with humans or pets for food."

Right where the Old Barrie road meets Russel road , its a t in the road so you either go left  or right  , so theres a pie wedge there that dose'nt get any tire tracks and thats where he sits , i've seen him there many nights this winter and always ignored him , now lately one of my guys who also go's by there started chaceing the thing with the tractor and at the same time laughing and telling the rest of us on the two way radio what he's up to . The yote is not scared at all and when chalanged he just moves out of the road a few feet then go's back to his perch . Funny as hec , the other night i went flying around the cornnor off the old barrie road and go south on the old second and there was the yote coming right up the middle of the road towards me carring a garbage bag. Guess when he saw me coming he droped it then made for the ditch , then i guess thinking he had time ran back and grabed it and drug it to the ditch , then droped it again and left it as he headed for cover , it was funny to me to see him act the way he did and it kind of made my night as i thought how smart these things are getting . Well last night James one of my drivers who was trying every time he got the chance to take him out , said when he came in at the end of the night that some one had beat him to it and that my little buddy was found on the sholder of the road when he went by to be dead'r then a door nail .

HE GREW UP IN OSHAWA, AND WAS WORKING FOR THE SUMMER IN NORTHERN SASK.Kenton Joel Carnegie, 22, maleNovember 8, 2005Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. Carnegie had gone for a walk and didn't return to the surveyors' camp where he was working. His body was found partially consumed in an area known to be frequented by four wolves which regularly fed on human refuse. The pathologist who performed the autopsy, testified Carnegie had lost about 25% to 30% of his body mass in the attack, with the top midsection to the thigh having been partially consumed.[38] Although originally the possibility that the culprit was an American Black Bear was not ruled out, a coroners' jury concluded after a two year inquiry that the attackers had indeed been wolves.[39][40]"
756022,turtle,2013-01-03 14:13:00,274,"This is an update on the HF wolves: HALIBURTON, Ont. - Three of the four wolves that escaped from a wildlife reserve after vandals cut giant holes in a fence on New Year's Eve have returned.  Reserve officials believe the fourth wolf, an alpa male named Haida, was shot and killed.  The wolves that returned to the 70,000-acre privately owned Haliburton Forest and Wildlife Reserve - located about 260 km northeast of Toronto - had yet to re-enter the 15-acre wolf enclosure on Wednesday.  ""They are literally outside the fence. They want to come back in, we just have to give them the opportunity to come back in,"" reserve owner Peter Schleifenbaum said.  Staff tried to lure them with food while trying to keep the pack's other five wolves inside the enclosure, he said.  The staffers were unable to get close enough to tranquilize the wolves.  ""Because we're dealing with unsocialized animals that are afraid of humans, they don't approach us,"" Schleifenbaum said.  As for Haida, Schleifenbaum said he believes a passing motorist shot the animal dead and took its carcass.  He said staff members drove past the wolf centre Tuesday afternoon and noticed a trail of blood about 200 metres north of the centre.  ""(Haida) was removed, we just saw the clear evidence...we know our wolves and are 99.999% certain,"" Schleifenbaum said.  The compound is surrounded by a double-fence - a 10-foot-high chain-link fence on the inside surrounded by a 12-foot-high fence. The giant holes were cut sometime between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.  ""We soon discovered that we still had wolves inside the enclosure and that it was not a tree that had miraculously smashed two fences but deliberate action by humans, who had cut large holes into both the inside and outside enclosures,"" the reserve said in a press release.  This is the first time something like this has happened at the wolf centre, which opened in 1996 and includes an observation area for the public.  ""We didn't have any communication, we didn't have any threats or anything like that,"" he said.  The holes in the fence have been patched up.  The wolves were born and raised in captivity and have no experience with hunting or fending for themselves. The centre feeds the wolves dead carcasses.  Schleifenbaum doesn't think the wolves pose a threat to the public, but he is concerned about their growing hunger.  ""They will approach local cottages as we expect them to look for food such as suet balls, garbage and even attempt to approach the odd small pet,"" he wrote in the release."

I followed one big guy on cross-country skies one day for over 3 kms...  He led me to his den area .. This wolf tracked absoulutely compass straight for all those kilometres.... He home was in a low area with many willows. The daylight was fading fast when I decided it was best time to leave the area.. I am sure he was eyeing me from somewhere close by.  Another time I heard some howling in he middle of the day.. close up behind my tent. I ran up into the bush to try and catch a site of the wolves and came across 2 very young timber-wolf pups, all  baby fur.. in a clearing.. Only about 20 feet away, with tongues out, waging their tails and wanting to play with me.. But mommy wolfe was close by just out of sight in the heavy brush, breaking dry branches with her feet to let me know she was there.. her way of telling me to get outta there...  If wolves get used to coming around for garbage and get used to being close to humans then you best kept your distance.  A young man from Ottawa was killed by  wolfs a few years back while working on an air-borne geophysics survey at Points North in northern Saskatchewan.  He went out by himself to photograph the wolves at the local garbage pit .. got way too up close and personal with them.  Like any wild animal .. wolves should always be respected.

In order to be ""documented"" these criteria must be met:  1. The wolf has to be killed, examined and found to be healthy.  2. It must be proven that the wolf was never kept in captivity in its entire life.  3. There must be an eyewitnesses to the attack.  4. The person must die from their wounds (bites are generally not considered attacks according to the biologists).   It has also been possible to identify two very distinct kinds of aggression against man by wolves:  A) When the attacks have dietary motivations:  o They occur in a rather vast territorial range; o They are occur homogenously in a long period of time, sometimes even many months; o They occur principally against young people; o More than one wolf can be involved; o If the attack is not interrupted, the victim is transported elsewhere and then dismembered; o If the attack is interrupted, rabies does not occur in the injured victim.  When the attacks are committed by rabies infected individuals:  o The attacks are numerous, concentrated in a small territory, with a behaviour which we can call “bite and run”, and occur in a brief period of time; o Men, women and children are attacked indiscriminately; o Unmistakeably committed by an isolated individual; o The attack never concludes with the transportation of the victim elsewhere or the successive dismemberment.

The two men started towards a haystack a few yards from the house to shovel a path around the stack when they were surrounded by a pack and devoured alive.[47]   Unknown African American, male  1830  Kentucky, near the Ohio border. While traveling through a heavily forested area, two African Americans were attacked by a pack of wolves. Using their axes, they attempted to fight off the wolves. Both men were knocked to the ground and severely wounded. One man was killed. The other dropped his axe and escaped up a tree. There he spent the night. The next morning the man climbed down from the tree. The bones of his friend lay scattered on the snow. Three wolves lay dead.[47]  James Smith  March 4, 1910  near Springfield, MO [51]. Wolves attacked him whilst he was alone in the woods, waiting for the return of his brother. When the latter returned he found his brother's bones. In the centre of a circle of five dead wolves, was an empty repeating rifle, showing that he had been overpowered before he could reload his weapon.[50]  Trapper and two Natives  1922  Ontario. When a trapper did not return to the post office as promised, two natives were sent to find him. All three were killed by wolves.[28]  Ben Cochrum  1922  Manitoba.
