So I'm looking for a new camera either plain or waterproof as long as it doesn't reset itself every time the battery dies. I know it's the camera my dad has the same one with the same issue.  So any opinions would be great..."

It works great, and does not reset when the battery is pulled. Fits in a shirt pocket and takes surprisingly good photos, especially in low light."
