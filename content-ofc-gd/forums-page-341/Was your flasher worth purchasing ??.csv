756395,Christopheraaron,2013-01-04 21:42:00,3525,"Thought I'd dig up this post, I got out on the ice today and realized that my pirahna max won't sense my transducer in cold water, any way to fix this?"
756398,Joeytier,2013-01-04 21:50:00,3990,"I used one for a season or two...absolutely hated the thing.  Very inconsistent display, and became less and less effective the colder it got.  Hardly even worth the effort of lugging the thing around."
756399,Christopheraaron,2013-01-04 21:52:00,3525,Anything I can do?
756405,Billy Bob,2013-01-04 22:22:00,5865, Probably not enough battery power.....
756408,wormdunker,2013-01-04 22:27:00,1711,"I purchased a Humminbird ice 55 flasher last season.  Love it!  Never used electronics on the ice til then.  U can zoom in on different depths of the water column, watch my bait as it descends, has dual beam transducer to narrow down the viewing area or expand it to a wider profile.  Used it while jiggging walleye in 43 fow, saw fish at 20', reeled up, fish on!  Also amazing to watch a whitefish dart off the bottom to hit my suspended bait! Without my flasher I would not have known there were fish cruising at different depths.    Won't go ice fishing without it!!  To add to what others are saying about the expenses involved to get out fishing, if I account the boats, motors, ATV, rods, reels, tackle, clothing, ice shack, heater, gas, motel, meals.  My fish is approximately $852.00 per pound!! HAHA!"
756410,Christopheraaron,2013-01-04 22:33:00,3525, Would a bigger battery warm it up maybe?
756411,Christopheraaron,2013-01-04 22:33:00,3525,Would it work better if I got an ice ducer?
756425,Joeytier,2013-01-04 23:11:00,3990,I highly doubt it.  The unit itself is just not powerful enough to be overly effective.  On warm days in < 14 FOW it's fine
756433,Fisherman,2013-01-04 23:38:00,7201," Sure, put it in warm water.    That aside, what do mean it's not ""sensing"" it?  It's either on or not.  Check the battery voltage to see that it's fully charged.  Just for the heck of it, put the transducer in a pail of room temp water.  Maybe a little cable/connector wiggle."
756439,wallyboss,2013-01-04 23:52:00,1095,"I am a Vexilar owner, I had an FL-8 and I upgraded to an FL-18 so I could get the Zoom feature.  Upgraded to an FL-22 last year. An FL-22 is not one that you would need because it only goes to 60ft. I will not leave home without my flasher. I also have a camera but it takes too long to set-up. I have a few other sonars that i could've used but once you are used to a flasher you will not go back."
756447,Christopheraaron,2013-01-05 00:19:00,3525," The thing works, turns on and everything, just when I turn it on (with the transducer in) is says that it's not connected, But it only happens in cold water, works fine in warm."
756448,Kerry,2013-01-05 00:21:00,383,Reminds me of my old TCR101 I had rigged up years ago.Worked great in the hut but once the cold got to it it just wouldn't work worth a darn.I'd say either try some hand warmers around it inside a cooler or its time to upgrade to something more suited to ice fishing. I'm partial to my x67.Can't wear the battery down in a day and it has both lcd and flasher mode.Love them both.I like the flasher for instant display and the lcd for memory which is great when a whitie or laker comes chasing up on your bait. Kerry
756451,Christopheraaron,2013-01-05 00:37:00,3525, Do you mean hand warmers around the console or transducer?
756455,BillM,2013-01-05 00:58:00,17367,"My Humminbird 747c does the same thing with my X19 iceducer.  When it's starting up press the menu button before it completely starts up and select normal..  Sometimes I've gotta unplug the transducer and plug it back in before the graph picks it up..  Not all the time, completely random."
756460,Christopheraaron,2013-01-05 01:10:00,3525,"Thanks Bill, I'll try that tomorrow."
750056,Slop,2012-12-08 01:00:00,151,"I've been happy with my Lowrance X67c that I puchased three years ago. It's been worth it's weight in gold yet at a fraction of the price of other manufacture's units.  One thing that I found with the X67c was the connector sleeves to the battery pack were not beefy enough to stand up to lots of use. I had some electronics wizzards beef up the wiring and modify it with a patch chord similar to the one you'd use to plug into a guitar or other A/V gear.  I get to slum around with alot of guys on the ice, including an R&D guinea pig from Vexilar(sorry Rob)and I think there is great value for your dollar with the product that Vex offers.  The Marcum line-up is nice too, however the showdown series(old VPG) has issues with the power on/off button. A buddy of mine sent me home with 2 units experiencing the same problem to be fixed by the wizzards.  You can't go wrong with the Humminbird stuff either. Light, simple functions and reliability all rolled into one unit.  Specifications play an important role in choosing the right gear for the job. Versatility, function/application and warranty need to be considered. You can't put a price on value.  I do love my ice machine."
750057,esoxcrazy,2012-12-08 01:05:00,22,"Ice-55 hands down my favorite fishing purchase to date!  Its will go on year 4 now and I also use my humminbird 596 lcd, but the flasher is the bomb!"
750061,dhickey,2012-12-08 01:16:00,1038,I concider myself to be a long time ice fisherman that has never felt the need to rely on electronics to catch fish. Shure they will let you  know whats going on under yor icehole at that particular momment but for me to trust a cold wet piece of electronics over the expieance of not only myself but the people Im fishing with is abolutely obsurde to say the least.. I can honestly say that the fish I remember had nothing to do with electronics. It was gut feeling(expierance) Unfortunately I have watched to many people relying on their electronics catching nothing worth talking about. Long and short is that you have to target and put in the time to figure out what is going on in relation to all conditions/ice/weather patterns but most of all taking the time to fish a body of water 2-3 times a week... That will put you on to fish. Hard or soft water!!!  Saltydawg.  Good luck.
750163,Billy Bob,2012-12-08 13:59:00,5865,Get a CAMERA instead....
750230,Meegs,2012-12-08 18:50:00,249,"Had 2 flashers, had a vex, sold it went with a new ice 55 hummingbird, used it 2 seasons got rid of it. Went back to a lowrance elite 5. Now that's a machine. Way way more versatile for the same price."

750290,irishfield,2012-12-08 23:49:00,26272,"I imagine you ran Terry off already.. but so can I, doing so every year on Temagami in depths to 140 feet. I use my Lowrance 102C off the bow of my boat and mark not only the jig but my swivel above it."
750291,Gerritt,2012-12-08 23:53:00,6129,Agreed Wayne..... Those that have tried to help this fellow received flak for doing so from the OP.... hard to say if any of them will return offering advice.  G.
750315,Fisherman,2012-12-09 01:48:00,7201,"Well I won't be to grumpy tonight, found an extra bag of potato chips I used an ancient Lowrance X40 for many many years, it would easily pick anything up at that depth.  I use an X67C in either the graph mode or flasher mode,  doesn't matter, you twitch the rod, it show right now.  I only paid $265 for mine and I've seen them cheaper."
750316,GbayGiant,2012-12-09 01:52:00,1780,Buy a Flasher or graph/flasher combo and you will not be dissapointed. Either one is worth every penny you chose to spend.  Tell your friend to enjoy what ever he buys.
750370,Rich,2012-12-09 12:31:00,3927,You cannot catch fish without a flasher.
750371,davey buoy,2012-12-09 12:33:00,5505,Or you could just follow the crowd!!.
750412,Sinker,2012-12-09 14:51:00,8692," Well, you can catch fish without electronics, but you will catch more with any type of electronic device.  I'm all for keeping things simple, and I do keep things simple, but when it comes to icefishing, I just can't do without my graph. I'd rather forget my boots than fish blind. It really does help.  With that said, I can't justify paying $500 for a flasher that I will use for a couple months every year, when my graph marks the exact same fish, and I can use it ALL year round. A flasher just doesn't make sense to me. If I had an extra 5 bills hanging around, then sure, but I don't!   S."
750419,moxie,2012-12-09 15:04:00,1566,"When the water hardens I hook up my Lms520c to the soft pack and take it out on the ice. As others have said its like fishing blind without one. I will say this though, that after staring at that circle of lights all day thats all i see when i close my eyes for a few hours afterwards."
750421,Rich,2012-12-09 15:12:00,3927,"My underwater camera was the best.. no silly lines going for other lines.. just fish, eating bait. Its nice to know theres fish.. nicer to know the species.."
750423,buckster,2012-12-09 15:28:00,530,Personally I'm a flasher  guy when it comes to ice fishing.  I had a vexilar before I owned a car lol.   It's all personal preference.  Only thing I can tell you is a quality flasher or graph will pay itself off the first season you use it.  It will put more fish on the ice for you too.
750431,Fisherman,2012-12-09 16:42:00,7201," Have you ever really sat down and figured out how much it costs per pound of fish after you buy all the trinkets.  I think it goes the other way, the more toys and trinkets you buy, the payoff becomes the little light at the end of the ever lengthening tunnel.."
750434,bare foot wader,2012-12-09 17:11:00,1354,the OP should let his friend fish with his flasher for a day or two...and then see how fast buddy makes up his mind about buying one    LOL fisherman....there's been a few trips where we've sat in the truck on the way home adding up numbers and calculating cost per fish...or when it's really bad cost per bite....sometimes it's better not to think about it  and of course the pie chart of fish caught per angler...the joys of accountants fishing together ha
750435,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-09 17:16:00,2582, I hear what you are saying  and I agree to a point. I also compare it to my veggie garden. In 87 I bought the top of the line rototiller to till my garden. I probably still have not recovered that expense. But I also highly doubt I would still be enjoying my garden if I was still just turning it over with a shovel.  Fishing Hunting and Vegetable gardening are 3 of the few activities/past times we can do and get something  substantial back in return. In these cases it is food. So I have always looked at spending $$$ on these endeavors as something free cause you get something substantial back. Not many pastimes can boast that.  Electronics will make the experience more productive and also more fun. That is what I have found anyway.  In the big picture it would probably be cheaper for most if not all of us to buy all are veggies/fish/meat from the grocery store. If I went that route I would be one grumpy miserable person to be around....but I'd probably be rich
750496,Photoz,2012-12-09 20:24:00,792,"I purchased a Vexilar SE in 2006, used it about 2 years, it was the difference between getting fish & NOT getting fish. The the FL 20 'Pro Pack' made its debut in 2008, it had several more purty l'il lights & lines . . . .    it must REALLY be good, I sold my barely used FL8SE to a good friend, and went for the fancier (looking) one. After using it a few times, I felt like trading Big Cliff for my old one back. There's not a thing WRONG with it, except the lines showing different depths confiuse th' 'ell outta me. If you DID decide to go for a Vexilar, an F8SE is all you need. I got about a dozen lakers, crusing anywhere between 40' & 80' down, that I'd never have known were there! As for the battery, I could 'squeek' about 2  -  7 hour shifts out in -15 weather before I had to charge it. When I saw your post, I pulled the Vex outta my clothes closet, and checked the batteries. The one I had hooked up since last March was still over half charged & the spare was just under about a third. Get yourself a decent flasher, Vexilar or Marcum, you'll very quickly wonder how you ever managed without one! The fish don't have a chance when ya go huntin' 'em with a flasher"
750551,ketchenany,2012-12-09 23:17:00,3229, We never used flashers! Good to see you back buddy.
750563,fishdawg,2012-12-09 23:44:00,912,all my Spin Doctor and Pro Troll flashers have definetly been worth the purchase! ;-)  Traded in my old vexilar Fl8 last year for an Eagle 502c combo unit ... more versatile and it will get used 12 months a year  Flashers are great if you ice fish often enough to justify the purchase.
750583,SirCranksalot,2012-12-10 00:51:00,3291,The only flasher I know is the guy who was going to retire but decided he would stick it out one more year.....but that's probably not the kind of input the OP was looking for either.
750639,jdmls,2012-12-10 03:57:00,575,You guys never used rods !!! I still remember the paper graph dumb ass rigged up ... That feels like a century ago LOL
750671,ketchenany,2012-12-10 12:02:00,3229, And we caugh fish!
749909,Woodsman,2012-12-07 16:16:00,1286,Yes without any problem in over 100'. No need to go through all that crap for an iceducer. The Humminbird XI-9-20 iceducer is a direct fit for the Piranha Max 160 or 170. But if saving money is the objective my mode is far cheaper than the $100 an iceducer would cost & performs the same. I have a XI-9-20 iceducer & have noticed no difference in performance. You can buy a 170 with summer transducer for the cost of just the iceducer.
749927,frozen-fire,2012-12-07 16:49:00,542,"I think what the OP wants is our opinions on FLASHERS...not sonars in general.  Here's my input:  I went with a Humminbird 345c a few years ago and couldn't be happier. I had the option of getting a flasher, but it just wasn't for me. The constant buzz and the flashing lights of a flasher just isn't what I'd like when out there on the ice. My unit has the option of using a flasher display, but I never use it. I always stick to the graph. I love how it records and shows a brief history of what happened, whereas flashers won't do that for you. You can be jigging away, and there's nothing on the screen. You turn around and talk to a buddy for a couple secs to see how he's doing. Turn back to your hole and you realize a fish just came up to your lure and went back down. Now you can drop it and try to entice it again. A flasher won't show you what happened. At least I don't think they can.  Visually, I enjoy the graph a lot more as you can see those lines come up and smash your lure!  I'd say let your friend try both and see what he likes."
749928,Billy Bob,2012-12-07 16:50:00,5865,Correct me if I'm wrong...but I believe the Ice Ducers are the same as the one you would mount on your boat but comes with a feature that allows it to float in a level position.
749930,BillM,2012-12-07 16:58:00,17367," Yup, no difference except for the design of the transducer itself..  I used a stsandard transducer on my 747c for a season but it was a pain in the ass.  The ice transducer is so much easier..  Just drop it in the hole and go..  If you spend a lot of time on the ice, this is the way to go for sure.  Also, flashers are great on the ice, but if this guy is a all season fisherman, get a graph..  A lot more versatile."
749931,Moosebunk,2012-12-07 17:00:00,3970," Not usually Bill.  THe ice ducers are often flat bottomed bells.   Anyways, my buddy StevieZ actually bought me an X67 as a thank you gift for taking him into Kesagami several times to ice some pike and eyes.  It never came out of the box up north.  Water never deep enough.  Down here I would fish some things without one, but most times it's a total advantage.  The X67 ""for free"" has served well.   Right now I need a new adapter for charging the 12V.  Dug out all the ice stuff a couple days ago.  Bring it!!!"
749937,trapshooter,2012-12-07 17:09:00,1234,"I'm a flasher addict, through and through...Humminbird ICE45.  No graphs/sonars for me... gotta be a flasher.  Guys could argue about flasher vs graph until spring, but the bottom line is they all work and your preference will be whatever you used first and got used to.  As long as you've got something electronics wise on the ice, you're going to improve your ice fishing."
749946,Woodsman,2012-12-07 17:19:00,1286,"As Moosebunk mentioned they are a different shape & generally lack the temperature sensor built into the open water transducer. This can cause some problems on some units which look for the temperature sensor to determine if a transducer is hooked up. On start up the unit will read ""No transducer found"". This can be manually overrode."
749948,BillM,2012-12-07 17:24:00,17367," Yup, I remember I was greeted with a nice 'Transducer not found screen' when I started up my graph the first time..  PITA!!!!!   lol!!!"
749954,Billy Bob,2012-12-07 17:51:00,5865, Don't you mean....NO FISH FOUND IN THIS LAKE....GO HOME AND GET WARM....LOL...
749955,BillM,2012-12-07 17:53:00,17367," The way Simcoe was last year, that's a pretty good description!"
749959,Woodsman,2012-12-07 18:11:00,1286,Actually I had no problem finding fish last year on Simcoe. The problem was finding good ice. With the limited freeze what was fishable was awful crowded.
749964,BillM,2012-12-07 18:22:00,17367," I wasn't in the mood to get greased out on Kempenfelt Bay last year, so I did most of my ice fishing north of Barrie  Lakers were good, whitefish were few and far between, even in the spring when everyone thought it was going to be a slay in the boats it was for the most part crap.  Let's hope we get some decent ice this year."

One thing I learned and love was finding walleye 6' off bottom I would have never caught them if I had not had my sonar.  You can also use it as a flasher

I run an ice55 and rave about how great it is and how it was worth every penny, but it's still not enough to convince my buddy to justify spending that kind of money on a flasher.. We fish a lot of water in the 90+fow range so anything less than 2400w output will not suffice.  If u own a flasher do me a favor and reflect how much u like it or don't and most of all ""was it worth every penny?"""

749807,Fisherman,2012-12-07 02:57:00,7201, I don't think you need anywhere near 2400W output.  I use an X67C and it has 800W and I have no trouble picking up my 1/4 oz jig in 90+ feet of water.  I paid just over $200 for mine. Matter of fact it does quite well in way over 100 feet for salmon.

Since I started ice fishing 3 seasons ago, I can only remember 3 fish I hooked on Simcoe that I didn’t get on the chase. I can figure out if I’m fishing dead water, what depth they’re holding at, how aggressive the fish are, what lures they’re responding to best, etc.  I tried fishing for lakers without a sonar unit when I first started and I won’t go back to fishing blind now.  It’s to the point now that I’m contemplating leaving a 2nd sonar unit in the car for backup (just in case the one I bring out onto the ice goes mental - which my old one did). Hands down one of the best ever investments I’ve ever made."
749834,Rich,2012-12-07 04:29:00,3927,"Depends how you fish. I run deadbait for pike most the day, my sonar is enough. If i was crappie/perch/laker/walleye fishing, you bet i'd drop the bucks."
749836,jedimaster,2012-12-07 04:37:00,3472,"Honestly it depends on what you want to do on the ice. Do you like to go ice fishing and shoot the crap with the boys while you watch your tip ups, or you do want to drill hole after hole and jig aggresively. I tend to be happy sneaking a wobbly pop on the ice and getting out with the boys. I used to have a vexilar but I didn't use it that much, although it did work really well. I bought a 5x dsi portable this year and plan to take it out with me this year. I am not so serious about ice fishing though. Just out for the fresh air and fun. If I was as serious into ice fishing as bass fishing I would have a vex or a marcum as well as an aqua view for the clear lakes."
749842,BillM,2012-12-07 04:48:00,17367,I never hit the ice without my Humminbird 747c.
749844,jdmls,2012-12-07 04:50:00,575,I'm just looking for input from flasher owners. . Thanks
749845,DRIFTER_016,2012-12-07 04:53:00,10439,I can't fish without my flasher. I can fish with a stick and string but without my LX-5 I'm lost!!!!

749848,crappieperchhunter,2012-12-07 05:15:00,2582,"I was a hold out on getting into the electronics for ice fishing. Even when I got a good deal on a used Vex SE8 it sat in my basement for 2 years before I dusted it off and gave it a go. I always figured I mostly fish perch through the ice and am usually in shallow water so what do I really need one for? Well after one outing I can honestly say I will never fish blind again. It helps in so many ways. I have learned 2 or 3 new methods of triggering no so aggressive fish to hit that I NEVER would have learned without watching how the fish react on the Vex. It also keeps you from sitting on dead water wasting your time. It helps me catch way more fish...no doubt about it. But besides the advantages it gives you...I just plain enjoy it more watching ""fish tv"".  The first season I used it I was testing it to see how long it would hold a charge and a couple of times the battery died half way through a day on the ice   It was unbelievable how much I absolutely HATED fishing blind after doing it for 25 + years.  I hope your buddy gets one. I know he will enjoy it."

749851,adempsey,2012-12-07 05:21:00,1498,"I love my flasher.  Definitely shines in many situations.   I can say that my catch rate improved dramatically with one.   There are plenty of situations I can recall that without it, I wouldn't have hooked the fish - let alone found any fish.   Any sonar suitable for ice fishing would be worth getting IMO."
749853,Woodsman,2012-12-07 05:23:00,1286,Here's how I did mine.    
749857,Christopheraaron,2012-12-07 08:24:00,3525,Thanks woodsman! Does it pick up your jig?
749859,Christopheraaron,2012-12-07 08:25:00,3525,Thanks woodsman! Does it pick up your jig?
749862,Vanselena,2012-12-07 10:12:00,269, If you go on ebay there are a bunch of iceducers for sale. Check the KHZ of your current model and if you have a spare transducer plug the you can rewire it to an iceducer.
749865,Billy Bob,2012-12-07 11:37:00,5865,I built my own box which holds a older Lowrance X-50 unit...works great and can always track my jig.....     BTW...you can purchase older graphs or flashers for penny's on the dollar using Ebay....
749887,Raf,2012-12-07 14:10:00,3495,"graph works fine, personally, i wouldn't specifically buy a flasher for ice fishing use.  my eagle 320 picks up my jig and any lakers coming up just fine.  if he has an lcd graph, i'd just tell him to retrofit it to work on the ice, if he doesn't, i'd tell him to buy a graph first.  my 0.02."
