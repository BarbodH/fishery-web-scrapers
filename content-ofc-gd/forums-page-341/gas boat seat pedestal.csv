756215,rob v,2013-01-04 03:08:00,535,"I've got one of these springfield gas pedestals on the casting deck of my boat.  It's got a ""banana seat"" on the end of it and the unit is designed to adjust hight using a lever on the top of the unit. the unit would rise and fall as you lift or depress the handle (gas powered?). It would seem that the one I have (came with the boat - minimum 5-6 years old) has lost its gas/compression - it no longer rises and when you pull the end up it just falls back down.  I'm guessing it's lost its gas somehow - probably a seal is gone.     Does anyone know if these are repairable / rechargeable or does the entire unit need to be replaced ?"
756218,irishfield,2013-01-04 03:22:00,26272,Once they go.. they go. Just make sure your lever is actually hitting the adjustable screw on the top of the pedestal.. or should I say not pressing it all the time which = no lock in place. Pull the seat off.. and see if it extends.
756219,rob v,2013-01-04 03:32:00,535,   Thanks Wayne - that's kinda what I figured.  I've got the seat off and the lever doesn't even touch the screw any more.   The sleeve the screw fits into moves up and down when I pull it - but there's obviously no more pressure/compression in it. Guess I'll have to do some shopping to replace it !
756222,irishfield,2013-01-04 03:41:00,26272,I had one go bad this summer... worked one day and dead the next. Luckily I had a pair from when they recalled what I had in the boat and didn't ask for the old ones back. BPS and Cabellas both have a wide selection to match what you have.. or at least they did. Look for a product number on yours and type it into Google.
756234,Garnet,2013-01-04 10:52:00,2056,I have 2 of these in my scrap pile. I replaced it with a mechanical adjustable one from BPS. Think it has 5-6 different heights. Worked fine for few years.
756243,moxie,2013-01-04 13:04:00,1566,I purchased a fixed height pedestal last season. I figure at 45 yrs old there's little chance of growing anymore and that way I'll probably never have to replace it. Might be an option for you. Your local marina would probably be able to order one in for you.
