Hay Bay is full of ice and we saw a couple out in front of Bayview Resort walking out there. Travelled around Route 9 back to Napanee and it's all ice and blowing snow.  The boat at my place has three feet of snow in it BUT there's a trail down past it, so with a little work and some sweat, it looks like we can it up to the road and ready to go. We'll wait for a nice day to spend some time and dig it out.  We were pretty glum looking at all the snow and ice and were even pondering getting out the sleds and augers.  We headed back from a gas purchase and went down to Rte 133 by the generating station - there's lots of open water there...... We drove down towards the ferry and had a look at the water from Bayside Drive, all we could see was ice from Keith Shoal all the way back towards the ferry, we didn't bother drive to the ferry to have a look, it would have to be iced in.  On our way back to Kingston, we stopped at Finkles Park Ramp.    The parking lot is plowed and so is the ramp.    A little closer inspection shows that a little sand or salt might be all that is needed to get the boat in the water.    After seeing the ramp, our spirits were brightened and there is hope full of it some soft water fishing after all. Only thing required would be decent weather and LITTLE winds......................  We had hope for the coming weekend BUT the forecasts are for 40-45KPH West Winds - not a good thing!!!!!!!  If you want to see the difference in a year have a look at what I posted last January - BIG difference.......  http://forum2.quintefishing.com/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=13523&hilit=launch+ramp  Stay Tuned................

755829,RangerGuy,2013-01-02 19:45:00,564,"Hi Superdad,  Just saw this post  Awesome! thnx for the update..  Sooo  40-45KPH West Winds .. would that me 4'+ waves.  I looked here Bath Weather Forcast  I always have launched at the ferry so I'm not sure about launching at Finkles.. are 20+km winds dangerous in the bath area for an 18' lund alaskan and would I be able to safetly get the boat back on the trailer without damaging it?  I'd really like to fish this Saturday but if I can't I can't"
755888,SlowPoke,2013-01-02 22:31:00,2984,"Well, at least they didn't barricade it like last year with the massive log.  Water level is down significantly!!  "
755920,RangerGuy,2013-01-02 23:42:00,564,"Is there a big drop at the end of the ramp, that you need to worry about or is it fairly flat a long ways out?"

756283,RangerGuy,2013-01-04 14:54:00,564,Starting to look promising... now they are calling for sub 1/2 meter waves.. so less than 2' ..  SuperDad You have a PM
