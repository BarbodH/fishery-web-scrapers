755559,misfish,2012-12-31 23:51:00,29133,I prefer to walk on 3-4 inches ty. SHOW OFF.   Have a great winter Dave.
755561,Christopheraaron,2012-12-31 23:57:00,3525,That would take like 10 minutes to cut 1 hole! There must be some mutant fish under it all for it to be worth it.
755564,irishfield,2013-01-01 00:03:00,26272,Sharpen your blades Chris!  Good to see you're having fun Dave!!!
755565,solopaddler,2013-01-01 00:05:00,8605,"  I don't want it, you can keep it."
755566,misfish,2013-01-01 00:07:00,29133,"Oh yeah,guess the new ,ICE ROAD TRUCKERS SERIES, should be starting soon."
755568,DRIFTER_016,2013-01-01 00:09:00,10439,  Maybe if you used a nice Strikemaster power auger instead of a spork you could get through a little faster.
755579,Musky or Specks,2013-01-01 00:36:00,2710,You forgot to mention picture was taken in the 15 minutes of daylight you get each day this time of year.
755585,chris f.,2013-01-01 01:39:00,95," lol, i was going to say... where are you, alaska? lol"
755608,Moosebunk,2013-01-01 05:37:00,3970,I envy that kinda ice!!!  But more so for the fish below it.
