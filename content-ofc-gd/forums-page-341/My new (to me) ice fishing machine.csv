755722,Gerritt,2013-01-02 01:24:00,6129,Picked this up for a song...     Should serve me well.... In good shape  Only one issue.... it needs a voltage regulator as the head light gets brighter the more gas I give it..... and blows out the bulb.... how hard is this to do myself? does it attach to the main off the engine or the battery? the part is around 40 bucks...  any advice?  G

755795,Gerritt,2013-01-02 16:20:00,6129,     Just had it out for a nice long ride  G
755798,Bernie,2013-01-02 16:34:00,3190,Just chatted with Jim. He thinks it is mounted forward of the rewind starter and down low. Almost under the engine. Regulator rectifier.
755799,Gerritt,2013-01-02 16:38:00,6129,Ok great Bernie thank you! I am nervous to turn on any of the electrical components until I get this replaced. The previous owner was blowing out bulbs.  I will pick one up in my travels...  Thanks again!  G
755815,Joey,2013-01-02 18:27:00,9122,Great machine Gerritt.  I hope we'll see you out on Simcoe this year then
