962895,Tjames09,2016-03-17 15:54:00,664,"I'm looking for a lodge for me and the wife to spend about 5 days in. Trying to find somewhere a bit on the nicer end of things (not to ""roughing it""). This lodge looks nice and offers nice boats at a decent rate for all. I haven't really found to much info on the Marten River itself for fishing."
962900,davew3,2016-03-17 17:14:00,430,I stayed there years ago.   Good fishing for perch and walleye and bass.  I know there is info on this site.  Use the search up at the top.   Make sure not to leave any garbage out at night. Lots of water to explore.  Have fun
962904,Rod Caster,2016-03-17 17:49:00,5784,"Olive the Lake lodge is apparently quite 'nice'. Never been, but I fished that area for years and that lake can be quite good at times for pickerel and pike and bass."
962908,G.mech,2016-03-17 19:05:00,830,"Beaverland Camp is a great place to stay but I would describe it as a little more 'rustic' than you may want...check out their website and see what you think.  It's a fun camp with great scenery, good fishing and also has a little community hall for fun after the day is over.   http://www.beaverland.on.ca/"
962925,huddy,2016-03-17 22:39:00,16,I've been with work guys to a fishing weekend at red cedar lake camp off the marten river and it was reasonably priced and great pike / walleye fishing.
962950,Fisherman,2016-03-18 00:39:00,7201,"My neighbour goes to Beaverland every year, fishing is so so, catching is nothing to write home about."
962952,LefroyFisherman,2016-03-18 00:48:00,602,"My wife and I honeymooned there 5 and a half years ago, fishing was pretty good, we had the dinner package, the food was amazing there! caught lots of small pike and one about 36 inchs, we were fairly late in the year in September. We didn't try for walleye. I would recommend the lodge."
