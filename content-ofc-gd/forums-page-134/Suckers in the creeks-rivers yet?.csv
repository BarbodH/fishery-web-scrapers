962292,dave524,2016-03-13 14:33:00,4508,"Yes you can net and spear suckers, before you question anyone's answer read the regs.  I told him to read the regs for his area, it is generally allowed but he mentioned east end tribs and I know that some steelheaders freak if they see someone with  a spear on their favourite trib so spearing is not allowed on some waters that receive runs of trout in the spring."
962297,Acountdeleted,2016-03-13 15:20:00,2562,"Or bow hunt. Man, I wanna get into that for suckers and carp this year."
962298,Steve,2016-03-13 15:34:00,2075,nothing beats a fresh cut sucker for the lower Grand River. Have them swimming in your livewell prior to use.  don't freeze your sucker bait....breaks the flesh down and makes the blood go funny.

962311,dave524,2016-03-13 16:50:00,4508,"I'm just envisioning the hilarity of spearing suckers on the east tribs in front of all the steelhead warriors   While you can spear or dipnet suckers in most zones , Mar 1 to May 30th, Zone 17 is missing from that list, you will see it listed separately with a season from the second Sat in May to the end of May, at which time they hope the steelhead have moved on."
962312,Acountdeleted,2016-03-13 16:53:00,2562,"Added bonus points, buy some grocery store rainbows and keep em in your pack. If anyone comes to talk to you just be like 'I already got my limit boys. These dumb things are so easy to spear!'"
962315,Steve,2016-03-13 17:26:00,2075," So how do you present the bait/ cut it up?  Take the live sucker, cut head off.  Throw into the river in the area you are fishing for chum.  then behind where you cut the head off, cut a single steak off.  don't cut more than you use at once, as it will start to dry out.  I have a couple large Tupperware tubs in my garage with pumps that I use to keep the suckers alive.  Usually three or four 20"" to 24"" suckers will do ya a good day on the grand....  We have also used cut bait rainbow trout from Lake Ontario...but the suckers work better."
962088,Fisherpete,2016-03-12 02:00:00,1814,Anyone seen them in their travels in the east end tribs? Time to stock up on cutbait for cats...  Thanks Pete
962093,misfish,2016-03-12 02:07:00,29133,And here I thought you were looking for bear bait. We get a good run here on the small tribs of Simcoe. How to you like them cut?
962133,Fisherpete,2016-03-12 14:29:00,1814,Frozen whole B - cut them right before use so all the tasty juices are still flowin!
962138,fishermccann,2016-03-12 14:42:00,655,Some in Duffins this past week.
962147,4x4bassin,2016-03-12 15:24:00,1025,"I will be watching this post , looking for some in my area as well !"
962148,huzzsaba,2016-03-12 15:28:00,884,whats the best setup for suckers?  pink worm under a float or split shot above the hook and let it sit on the bottom?
962151,fishermccann,2016-03-12 15:42:00,655,"I just use a dip net, where they are thick, you can't even lift the net out of the water, but must drag it out."
962156,huzzsaba,2016-03-12 16:09:00,884,"didn't know you can use a dip net for them, especially for the bigger size one.  Good to know!"
962162,Joeytier,2016-03-12 17:17:00,3990,"I caught one yesterday while speck fishing ripping an egb lol apparently they like hardware sometimes.  Small black woolly buggers and leech flies work great, worms.  They're not exactly finnicky.  If you find them, you catch them (or net/spear them)"
962168,manitoubass2,2016-03-12 18:32:00,11391,"They love the lil 3"" ripple shads lol  They are thick here. River and creeks are wide open?"
962169,Acountdeleted,2016-03-12 18:35:00,2562,They'd be more fun to reel in IMO. They have a bit of power to em. Will they hit when they are running the rivers and creeks?
962171,misfish,2016-03-12 18:39:00,29133,"And with the cold water, they are not bad eating as well."
962172,manitoubass2,2016-03-12 18:46:00,11391,"Yeah, if you find a spot that doesnt have 8 bajillion suckers in it lol  Yeah a 6lb sucker fights darn good!  I like catchin em when they stack up in the rapids in july, super fun!"
962173,crappieperchhunter,2016-03-12 18:46:00,2582,"And with the cold water, they are not bad eating as well. Never tried them fresh Brian. However my old bosses wive did  them up in mason jars. Supplied her with suckers every spring and got a few jars of the finished product. It was awesome. Better then any canned tuna I have ever had."
962174,manitoubass2,2016-03-12 18:52:00,11391,Pretty good smoked too!

962195,Acountdeleted,2016-03-12 20:51:00,2562,Thanks bud. Always looking for new excuses to eat fish. Especially ones that are less targeted.
962196,manitoubass2,2016-03-12 20:54:00,11391,Yeah they are good Jer
962210,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-12 22:03:00,8243,Is it legal to net suckers? I'm thinking maybe because they are nothing more than big minnows.  I have had more luck with Shrimp than the stinkiest putrid smelling sucker or chicken liver bait for Cats. Then you can eat what you didn't use for bait. Uncooked shrimp and precooked have both worked. I won't let Fishmaster's secret Cat bait in my boat.
962214,manitoubass2,2016-03-12 22:29:00,11391,"Dood suckers get purdy big. The onew I catch on line are usually around 5/6lbs, that aint a minnow lol"
