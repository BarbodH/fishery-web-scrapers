962458,FLEX ROD,2016-03-14 14:49:00,394,"Lately all I do on here is ask for help, well unfortunately here I go again.  Just got back from holiday and I find out my daughter was backing out of the garage and was not watching and hit the passengers side mirror.  Does any one know where I can find a passenger side mirror for a 2007 Infiniti fx35?  I have checked and basically I am looking at almost $1000.00, I have also checked and their are none at any wreckers in Ontario.  The wife took her car out this morning for the first time and she is not happy so I really have to get this resolved ASAP.  HELP PLEASE, thank you all for any suggestions,  FLEX"
962460,Freshtrax,2016-03-14 15:08:00,2215,Is the glass just broken or is the whole mirror assembly toast?
962462,DRIFTER_016,2016-03-14 15:12:00,10439,Give this a try. Don't know which version of vehicle you have but did a quick look for a 3.5 regular ignition and found a white one in BC for $120.  http://www.car-part.com/
962463,FloatnFly,2016-03-14 15:13:00,1640,"mmm the joys of having a luxury vehicle, you get to pay luxury prices.  probably heated with a turn signal built in, plus the cost of labour. check ebay, or kijiji.  I do find it hard to believe that no auto wreckers ontario wide have the part, there are a couple around here that are go tos for used parts for mechanics is doms auto in Courtice. give them a call, maybe they can help you"

Sorry been out of the auto repair biz for awhile trying to remember names....... Cookstown auto as well.  The body guy I know passed away"
962477,FLEX ROD,2016-03-14 15:38:00,394,"Thanks folks, unfortunatly the whole thing is toast, not just the mirror.  The wreckers in Ontario are conected via online data base and I checked with the one I have used in the past and that is how I know that none are available in Ontario.  Thanks Dave, will check it out.  FLEX"
