Your boat moght be sitting out in a field for all you know! This is no fly by night operation. Been around for many years. Bought my first outboard there in 1972.  There is a thing called ""due dilligence"" On whose part? Think maybe the marina should be diligent and maintain reasonable access ​for it's customer's?"

962074,cheaptackle,2016-03-12 01:27:00,849,"Roe Bag - Please be assured I mean nothing but respect when I say this; From what I've seen thus far you've put a lot of effort in for a few hours now to this rant as you so correctly titled it. Take a breath, hop in the car tomorrow and talk to the guy.  That appears to be something you haven't done yet. You've assumed the worst - which can be a good thing rather than get your hopes up and be disappointed. Now try to make it better for yourself - nobody is going to do that for you. Just approach him and ask if there is any way your goal can be achieved.  Do calmly remind him of your first conversation and segue into how many years you've dealt with him and what you've spent with him in those years. I've gotten all this and more out of what you've expressed - now he needs to hear it too.  Maybe he hasn't told you everything, like if it is a leased barn maybe even HE hasn't got access to it at this time for some reason he hasn't told you yet. If you don't get what you want then clam up until you get your boat hooked onto your vehicle - at that point you can express all your frustrations on him and never return if that's your choice. But getting worked up over it right now ain't doing y'all any good at all - and getting others worked up ain't helping you either. I really hope this works out for you but please remember - the only way it will work out is if YOU work it out, otherwise the only SURE thing you or anybody else can know right now is that it may very well be mid or even end april before you see your boat again. Good Luck to you and I meant what I said about it working out for you.  Michael"
962075,manitoubass2,2016-03-12 01:30:00,11391, But you know its a possibility and still did it.  Thats on you and him.  It is what it is.  When i was a rookie in the oilfield i stored 100's of safety trailers atta time.  I could easily pull out a specific trailer because I thought ahead and accordingly.  Thats why I mentioned laziness and poor business practice.  If he has 50 boats in his shed I could re arrange the whole place in a few hours no problem.

962064,John Bacon,2016-03-12 00:46:00,3277," What contract is that? The one where he digs a hole. Buries it and waits for it to crawl out in the Spring. The very least I would expect is maintain reasonable access for everyone. Not a lot to ask for $400.  I think it is a lot to ask for $400.  That is not a high number for winter storage.  There are a couple of ways that he can provide access to your boat.  However, if he did tell you that you could get your boat in March, then you do have a valid complaint.  I wouldn't expect him to remove everyboat in the building to get at mine first; but, I would expect him to be honest about when I can expect to be able to pick up the boat.  If he had been upfront, then perhaps you could have arranged for your boat to be put in last so it would be the first one out.  Although, this may have meant not putting it into storage as soon as you wanted to; or, pay a premium for moving your boat out of the way everytime he added a new boat.  p.s. If you don't know where the boat is then he may be outsourcing this have be at the mercy of someone else.  Depending on where it is located he may also have to wait for the ground to dry out before he can begin removing boats."
961949,Big Cliff,2016-03-11 12:36:00,6899," Rental agreement states: Boat removal is based on a mutually agreed date, providing there is reasonable access to the boat. When I entered into the agreement I told him the only reason I was storing the boat was because of the renovations. He asked how long I thought I would need his services. A month or two? I said ""you might as well keep it over the Winter that way I'm sure everything will be done. I'll just pick it up in March"". There was no hesitation on his part. Sadly I've been dealing with this same guy for many years. Spent a lot of money there. He's a reputable dealer. First time I've had any grief. But, it will be the last.  Perhaps I'm naive, but I don't think access should ever be an issue. It should be up to them to maintain reasonable access. The real issue is the fact that they are greedy pigs. Overfill the space and then say ""sorry 'bout your luck"".  A crock and a half of you know what!!!!!  Ok so it's in black and white ""mutually agreed date, providing there is reasonable access to the boat.""  You want it now and he doesn't agree that there is reasonable access to the boat. You might not like it but you did accept (and I would expect signed a contract). Go in person and talk nice and see if you can help move a few tubs to get to yours...gotta try I'm with Dara on this one, calling them greedy pigs and getting all upset isn't going to change it. Go and talk to the guy, I am sure that with this early spring there are going to be a lot more people wanting to get their stuff out of storage early. Perhaps you can work something out with the guy, might not be EXACTLY what you want but perhaps a reasonable compromise."
961951,Roe Bag,2016-03-11 13:20:00,246,"If they weren't greedy pigs, reasonable access would be maintained. Instead, they fill every usable inch and let the owners suck it up.

961960,DanD,2016-03-11 13:58:00,2223," No. I expect him to store them in a ​reasonable fashion. ​So access is maintained. No one should be allowed to withhold someone else's property for their own convenience.  You want to talk unreasonable. ​How 'bout this?  Pay $400 up front. But gee it's really not convenient right now. You'll have to wait! Maybe I can get to you by mid April. What was the $400 for? A patch of ground in a barn somewhere and a convenient for him, release date.  5:30 in the morning. Stomach is in knots. Haven't slept a wink.    ​ ​ ​  OK so the guy stores all the boats so that everyone can get at their boat anytime they want it. Now add up the lost revenue from the boats that he can no longer fit into the warehouse. Take that number and add it equally to the remaining spots that are left. I can see an eaisy 40-50% increase in storage fees; I wonder how much people would be willing to pay for that privilege?  Dan."

A couple of people have suggested going and talking to him; all you come back with is ""it sucks, it aint fair, he's an..... well never mind you get the drift.  Seems like you have a few years under your belt so I would think you'd be smart enough to understand that a contract is just that. Was there anything in the contract that said ""I'll pick it up in March""? If the winter had been like last year would you still have wanted to pick it up in the first two weeks in March?  I would love to meet you and get to know you because if I was to form an opinion based on what you have posted on this thread I'd expect to meet a spoiled brat (which I'm sure you aren't) but that's the way your posts are coming across.  Hope this ends up working out to your satisfaction buut I sort of doubt it!"
962028,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-11 22:40:00,8243,"Roe Bag,you have a contract so at least you have something rather than a handshake which sadly today means nothing. The two things on your side is that you have a mutually agreed on date for removal, March, but if that's not written on the contract it means nothing, he said, she said. Now the question is what is meant by ""reasonable access""? That's the tough one, how one person interprets it here is not what Roe Bag may interpret it. I want my boat, if you jammed your place up so that ""reasonable access"" isn't now possible or it's not reasonable to move 50 boats to get your boat accessible how is that Roe Bags problem? The owner of the facility should have taken steps to ensure access was ""reasonable"". So now it's on the owner but he refuses to make the boat ""accessible"" what recourse does one have other than to pursue a lawsuit in small claims court in the future. That doesn't get the boat out now though. And then the plaintive needs to show what is his loss. What if it was a charter guys boat and he planned on taking charters out as soon as ice out and the guy says nope, unreasonable access. The owner looses for sure I believe strongly. I might think Roe Bag might win in court for a portion of the storage fee because his monitory loss isn't quantifiable, that would be up to a judge. However a contract is only binding if there is a meeting of the minds and here there wasn't obviously so there is no contract according to some legal eagles. One would have to prove the owner knew exactly what was agreed to specifically releasing the property in March but now says no.  A good lesson to us all. I drive contractors, sellers, buyers or business associates bonkers sometimes. W5, who, what, when, where and why, then throw in how and we have a deal, otherwise I'll look to someone else.  This a good lesson for us all."
962031,Roe Bag,2016-03-11 23:10:00,246,"Sorry but if I am reading this right and you were dealing with me right now you wouldn't see your boat until June!  So the guy is a greedy pig because he fills all the spaces he has and hasn't set it up so you can access your boat when ""you"" want; it's how he makes a living, empty spaces cost money! He must be doing something right if he has all those units stored there!  You said you have been dealing with him for years and never had a problem; to me it sounds like he must be a reasonable guy. All these years and never a problem before?  A couple of people have suggested going and talking to him; all you come back with is ""it sucks, it aint fair, he's an..... well never mind you get the drift.    I'm sorry you even read this. Even sorrier for your reply! You have no clue. I don't think you really read this. Just picked out the highlights to find some crap to chuck. I spent much money there over the years making purchases. Not renting space! And, yes I was satisfied! Now he has me dancing to his tune. Packs everything in like sardines. Total disregard for access for anyone. Then covers his ass with an obscure little clause on the back of the page. ​Boat removal is based on a mutually agreed upon date providing there is reasonable access to the boat.  ​Who's responsible for reasonable access. Sure as heck ain't me.  Spoiled brat indeed.  ​​ ​"
961871,Roe Bag,2016-03-11 00:38:00,246,"For the first time ever I put my boat into storage last Fall. I was doing renovations and needed my garage for materials and related equipment.  With the change in weather, I called and asked to get my boat out of storage. Apparently because I was one of the first to put a boat in storage, mine is boxed in by too many boats. I'm being told I will have to wait until MAYBE mid April until some of the others are picked up. Is this Bull or is this how they all operate?????  Fit to be tied!!!!!!!!!"
961874,mikeh,2016-03-11 00:45:00,824,"that's how it works, same thing happened to me a few years ago"
961876,irishfield,2016-03-11 00:49:00,26272,"You get what you pay for.. that's for sure. It sucks, but being at the door is key. Guy here in Penetang leaves an ""extraction"" row so with a bit of work and wheel dollies anyone can get their boat out ""first""."

961892,spincast,2016-03-11 02:00:00,3279,"yup. wanna be first out, gotta be last in. I waited 3 weeks last year, and I had been using the same place for 3 years, was always out in March. Wasn't happy, but what you gonna do, the guys with the RVs and collector cars, trailers and boats aren't coming, even if they are in town. Sucks but that's the way it  is. This year made sure I was first in line.  And with this winter, I should have waited even longer."
961907,Consigliere,2016-03-11 03:00:00,121,Pretty sure most operate like spincast said. Bad luck.

961920,Dara,2016-03-11 03:35:00,3052,Go in person and talk nice and see if you can help move a few tubs to get to yours...gotta try

961927,glen,2016-03-11 04:06:00,2641,I guess. Boats should be getting moved around because other people will want to get out too.  Hope you get yours out.

Id call their bluff and be pissed  Easily can be done in one day, EASILY I think the business owner would expect to be paid for that one day of labour and overhead before sorting through all of the boats.  And they may want to use a person with proper safety training, etc. for the fork life; not some random teenager willing to work for a low wage.  The owner should have been more clear up front.  But I think that first in, last out, is reasonable."

961933,cram,2016-03-11 05:05:00,1733,What do you want the guy to do? Move everyone's boats whenever someone wants there's out?  That seems kind of unreasonable to me.

961939,manitoubass2,2016-03-11 10:06:00,11391,Im with the op on this one.  Arrange the boats properly and its easy as heck to move even 50 boats in a few hours with a forklift.  Sounds like a lazy operation to me

No. I expect him to store them in a ​reasonable fashion. ​So access is maintained. No one should be allowed to withhold someone else's property for their own convenience.  You want to talk unreasonable. ​How 'bout this?  Pay $400 up front. But gee it's really not convenient right now. You'll have to wait! Maybe I can get to you by mid April. What was the $400 for? A patch of ground in a barn somewhere and a convenient for him, release date.  5:30 in the morning. Stomach is in knots. Haven't slept a wink.    ​ ​ ​"
