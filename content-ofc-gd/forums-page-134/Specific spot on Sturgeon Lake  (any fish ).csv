(I actually wish we could have these as PSA's on the front of OFC).  Looking at the thread, it has had almost 1000 views in just a couple of days. With the threads easily searchable on google if you were to put lets say 'Sturgeon Lake fish spot' it makes the information easily accessible to a lot of people. Random people may stumble across this and say 'I don't know where to fish on Sturgeon. This is a good starting spot.' and before you know it, good fishing spots aren't that good anymore.  A lot of us razz you because...... well its what we do to anyone. B, Nick, Chad. Joey, Chris K and dynamic_bear grill me all the time and I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm never worried about the people who rib me and give me a hard time, its the ones that are only nice that I worry about."

Trust me, the people on this website are far from rude, some can be salty, but man up and laugh it off.  My experience on this forum has been nothing but positive, and trust me, ive caught many a fish including a few legit trophies that would have never been caught without the direct help of some of our board members. So thats saying something right there."
961706,ehg,2016-03-10 02:40:00,2666,Can anyone tell me if there are fish here and what type?  Dropped pin  https://goo.gl/maps/2wt3syg31ZA2  It's a boardwalk over a marsh/ small creek. Maybe puny sunfish or small bullhead. Waste of time.  Just the truth.
961708,Tjames09,2016-03-10 02:48:00,664,"Okay...Ive edited the first post, this really isnt helpful and not why I joined this forum. Like i said, simply saying posting specific coordinates is not allowed here would have been fine."

""Trolling"" I believe they call it. How many times have we not seen posts that are clearly meant to rile people up? When guys ask what the best recipe is for 50 inch musky is that supposed to be answered seriously?  If that was not your actual intent (to post a question that would obviously get a reaction) then I am stunned. Having said that, don't discount my advice, it may still be a good carp spot."

I welcome some new blood around here. Hey, come on now. I thought I was being fairly broad about my question. It's not like you could google Sturgeon Lake and not find thousands of posts and articles telling you that yes, in fact there are fish there. I was skeptical about the Pine River Provincial Fishing Area because it, in fact, looks nothing like a fishing area. And there is literally no information about it other than records of it possibly being stocked in the early 80's. It's a public park too, so I don't think it's a big secret spot that no one is supposed to know about.  FYI - I assumed this was a troll/joke thread too. Literally asking for tips on a specific spot?"
