I'm definitely in the market for a new hardware stick.  Thanks very much. Wow that's a good eye you have.  Yes it's a 10'6"" St.Croix Wild River rod.  I got it 2-3 years ago and it's been absolutely great for me.  Exclusively use it for hardware.  The water that day was still a little dirty but cleaning up and I was using a frog pattern flatfish for 20 min with no luck.  I had read an article recently how black works better in dirty water as it provides more of a visible silhouette for the fish and sure enough the first cast connected. I was by myself for 1st, 2nd, and 4th pics so all I had was a go pro on a 6"" tripod, hence the ""bass"" holds LOL."
