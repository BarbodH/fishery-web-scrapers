962232,Joey,2016-03-13 00:43:00,9122,"Hey, can't go fishing now, hard water is too dangerous  Soooo, I was cleaning today and have been moving around two of the fluorescent bulbs that have recently burned out on me, not knowing what to do with them.  I looked online and it's very vague what to do with them.  It is, on the other hand, not vague on what not to do with them, like throw them out, break them, or put them in the recycle bin in case they break and mercury gets released.  What do you guys do with them, I'd like them gone!  Thanks  Joey"
962233,DRIFTER_016,2016-03-13 00:46:00,10439,â€‹Our landfill site has a bin for fluorescent bulbs. Maybe yours does too.
962234,spincast,2016-03-13 00:49:00,3279,Lowes takes the compact ones for recycling the long tubes we have to wait for the hazardous days at the local landfill
962236,woodenboater,2016-03-13 01:06:00,2277,"Transfer stations will take household hazard waste such as batteries and fluorescent lights (tube and cfl). I'd think Richmond Hill would have similar arrangements, maybe see what the town website says ?  Good luck and thankfully cfl's will be a thing of the past as led becomes more commonplace and affordable."
962238,Joey,2016-03-13 01:08:00,9122,"Okay, thanks guys.  I'll look up the Richmond Hill website and see if they have a landfill site."

962255,adempsey,2016-03-13 03:03:00,1498,"I drop them off at the city run Enviro Depot.  Take my batteries, smoke alarms, electronics, construction waste, leaves etc... there.  As mentioned, some stores accept batteries and bulbs for recycling."

962439,AKRISONER,2016-03-14 13:22:00,5558,"I work for the company that does all of the other hazardous waste  www.makethedrop.ca  we dont do bulbs thats a different company, but your local landfill/transfer station will most definitely have a hazardous waste drop off.  To the people that said ""we just toss them out"" I dont know why you are advertising your lack of care for the environment?"
962443,dave524,2016-03-14 13:34:00,4508, I hear it's good in fish.  Just hang them by their tails for a hour before cleaning and then cut the heads off.
