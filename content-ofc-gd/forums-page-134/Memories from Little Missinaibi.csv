962723,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-16 07:34:00,8243,"Man that was great to see. Especially when I realized it was a montage of photos not a video and stopped swearing at my laptop. I fish 99% here on Erie, water 360 degrees then more water. Not like up North, nothing to see, big fish but it can get boring really fast fishing longline unless you are dodging a lake freighter. We had a camp south of Westmeath on the Ottawa and I really miss the scenery like in your video as well as the former in laws place on Nippising. I have to do more shore fishing for Bass this year.  Thanks for the memories Sir, appreciated."
