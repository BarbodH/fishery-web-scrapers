Probably won't go for the expense of a Quebec license, but I've heard that fishing the St. Lawrence is license free as it's federal jurisdiction. Am I correct in that assumption?"

We stayed here and loved it.  http://www.clubtadoussac.com/  Chalet on a small lake owners were extremely nice. Cabin/cottage was clean, had all electric appliances, full bathroom facilities, charcoal BBQ, firepit ( free wood supplied), however bedding isn't supplied. They have an exclusive territory for trout fishing however we booked a cabin for the accommodation only package for a few nights. Location is about 10 minutes east of Tadoussac and 15 minutes west of Bergeronnes ( most whale tours go from here). I didn't do the whale tours but everyone else took a tour and liked it .I liked this spot to watch them : National Parks Cap de Bon Desir (just eastof Grand Bergeronnes)  and Pointe Noir Interpretation and Observation Centre (on the west side of the Saguenay River just before the ferry); both of these are accessed right from Highway 138. As for fishing without need of license this site says it's not required:  https://www.sepaq.com/pq/ssl/index.dot?language_id=1 .   If I can provide any more info for you let me know."
