962980,manitoubass2,2016-03-18 09:24:00,11391,Still no idea but apperently grandma is safe.  Someone took hostages and held up in a house.  That road is the only way in or out of town and I hear the line up is rediculous on the tbay side.  Hope it turns out well
962983,manitoubass2,2016-03-18 10:34:00,11391,Yaya. Stand off is over. Peaceful resolution with no reported injuries.  Glad for all those involved.  And happy for those stranded east of the bridge since 11am yesterday.  Standoff ended at 330 am the radio is saying  ???
962985,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-18 10:37:00,8243,"Wow, keep us updated. We had an incident the other day at the Cayuga Bridge rebuild over the Grand River, nothing serious. I guess not everyone got the memo that the Haudnososne Business Disruption, I mean Development, group gave the province the all go because they got pieced off to continue work on a job that was supposed to take a year and we are going on year 11.  I was typing this when you were too, glad all is well, for now. Was it domestic or political Rick?"

962991,manitoubass2,2016-03-18 10:54:00,11391,"I have no idea what caused this?  But I think its fair to assume someone is seeing some serious jailtime.  From what I heard, a ""special tactics"" force was sent in from thunderbay to resolve the issue"
