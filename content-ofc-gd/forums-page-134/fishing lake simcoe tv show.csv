I had the pleasure to be asked to film a show with Justin Gerrard. Turned out it was the coldest day of the year.  I think its only on rogers tv on georgina side of the lake but it is also on you tube.  Heres the link...  hope you enjoy!

963052,Meegs,2016-03-18 18:00:00,249,I prefer to think of it as some ways work better than others Brian.  But once you figure out what works best for you then its game on. You got it figured out!!!  And yes. Justin is a great guy to fish with!
963053,misfish,2016-03-18 18:01:00,29133,"Ya, I hear ya bud. It was just me and not the jig."

963084,MJL,2016-03-18 23:01:00,2427,Great vid! I opted to stay in on that Saturday when it was -35 + windchill.LOL  Great tip on how to work those jigs...So far I've only ever caught 1 fish (a whitie) on that style of jig but it's something to try next season
