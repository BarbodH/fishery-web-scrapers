961845,esoxansteel,2016-03-10 23:30:00,1307,"Bob was a passionate reporter. and is what everyone should strive to be as a human been, Rip in peace"

961850,misfish,2016-03-10 23:43:00,29133,"When I moved to Barrie many years ago, I was an avid hockey player. Talking to some locals, I was told to just show up with my equipment and hang around during adult league hockey. I did, I had no idea whom I was talking to at the time when I was asked, are you playing the next game? I responded no, just hanging out looking for a team to play on.  Turned out to be Bob that approuched me, and told me they were looking for an extra player. I played the remaining year for his team and some shinny wednesday afternoons with him at the old Dunlop arena, I still remember him burning up and down the ice wearing those cooperalls, wearing his flyers jersey. LOL  Funny how first impressions last a life time.  If I had a picture of him wearing those cooperalls, that would be going on the fridge................................"

Bob got a laugh out of that, the man was graceful thru chemo years ago and showed he was not a quitter, an inspiration to us all  We had quite the day with Bob even a little flying, used to burn his ear off at the old co op store  Keep on flying Bob, fly in peace"
961860,Fisherman,2016-03-11 00:10:00,7201,"Sad to see him go, he just retired a short ime ago."
961863,NAW,2016-03-11 00:23:00,4022,Sad news indeed.  He's got a face and attitude that you just can't forget eh
961880,irishfield,2016-03-11 00:53:00,26272,"Sad indeed. I knew when Bob ""retired"" in the Fall that his time had come. Going to work was pretty much all that kept him going forward the past decade. I've known Bob personally, thanks to the aviation world, for over 25 years and you couldn't have met and known a finer gentleman. Bob fought a great fight, no holds barred, I hope he rests easy."
961896,4x4bassin,2016-03-11 02:28:00,1025,"Been watching him for many years , he had a real passion for central Ontario weather . Rest in peace Bob ."
961902,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-11 02:45:00,8243,"He will be missed. We still get Barrie and watch the news from there rather than TO or Hamilton. He seemed to be a ""real"" person. I wished I knew him. Rest in peace Bob."
961915,chris.brock,2016-03-11 03:28:00,4053,"I remember watching him for years when I was up north on CKVR, along with Leave it to Beaver reruns, years ago.  ""If you have to work this weekend, I hope you make a pot full of money""  Sad news, seemed like a positive guy."
961918,Dara,2016-03-11 03:32:00,3052,I have no idea but if you guys respected him I'm sorry for your loss and offer condolences to the family and friends
961962,misfish,2016-03-11 14:15:00,29133,"Wayne, heard today that he was asked to retire or keep working. He retired, so two other people could keep their jobs. That's the kind of man he was. Always for others."
961999,ratherboutdoors,2016-03-11 18:40:00,132,The world could definitely use more people like him.  FYI. CTV Barrie is doing a special on him tonight at 6.  I set my PVR.
962013,woodenboater,2016-03-11 21:48:00,2277,"Man, I had no idea he was not well. He was of a generation of weather casters (Dave Duvall is another) who made it entertaining."
962050,misfish,2016-03-11 23:58:00,29133,"THAT , was a SUPER ending.  RIP BOB"
