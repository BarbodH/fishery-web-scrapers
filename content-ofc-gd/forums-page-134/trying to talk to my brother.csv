962939,manitoubass2,2016-03-17 23:56:00,11391,"Man up here and go visit your brother.  Nobody should say goodbye over a phone, go give him some peace"
962940,irishfield,2016-03-18 00:01:00,26272,"Sorry Rick, but you're out of line."
962943,manitoubass2,2016-03-18 00:08:00,11391," Id even chip in on plane tickets to help him get there.  Its a horrible situation no matter what, but he deserves to see his bro and vice versa, IMO  A phone call is no way to say goodbye imo.  In my family we'de travel continents to give peace.  Blizz hit me up, ill seriously pay for your ticket if needed"
962946,FloatnFly,2016-03-18 00:31:00,1640,"As much as it pains me to say it  manitou is right.......  Blizzard, please take Big Cliff up on his kind offer, and go see your brother"
962948,manitoubass2,2016-03-18 00:35:00,11391,Ya got my email bud. Hit me up and ill make it happen
962957,mr blizzard,2016-03-18 01:26:00,1589,"I really appreciate it but after talking with him a few weeks ago which due to his condition I cant now.... because of his wishes  he asked that myself and one other brother which are out of province do not come and see him since that would be like making him come to the realization that his last dime is expiring and there is no hope, coppers , the legit ones like military are trained to overcome the situation no matter what, I cant in good faith burst the bubble, his ethic looked after people in this country for over 30 years, even after being shot. but I truly appreciate what your saying"
962958,ccmtcanada,2016-03-18 01:51:00,7971,"I'm am glad you got to talk to him, and sad for you as well."
962959,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-18 02:28:00,8243,"I'm with M2B2, go and see your brother. You said before you have the money to do it in a different thread. Your brother said not to come because I believe he was thinking about the burden on your family. Go see him before it's too late. Maybe it's just me but I don't think an internet forum is the place to seek advice on a personal matter as delicate and personal such as this. Please, just my opinion right or wrong. I am more than a bit old fashioned. I am most likely wrong here."
962961,FloatnFly,2016-03-18 02:59:00,1640,"I realize, and can sympathize with what your brother is saying, but, in your heart, you know what the right thing to do is, against his wishes or not, I think he would be very happy to see you"
962964,mr blizzard,2016-03-18 03:24:00,1589,"I'm with M2B2, go and see your brother. You said before you have the money to do it in a different thread.

I am more than a bit old fashioned. I am most likely wrong here. I appreciate what u are saying, but things have changed greatly in this country since the 70s and 80s When my grand father went to war it was not for the almighty dollar is was first and foremost to protect the rights and values of this country, whether they came home or not, they knew they would not come home millionairs if they even came home at all, but that was a decision they made even at the costs of family  just a few decades later those values were still alive and real for all who were sworn in to look after this country, it just wasnt for a coushy pension, and when stuff hit the fan they were there to protect the people in the area they were responsible for, when they usually on their own arrived at a call many times without radio contact once out of the cars their minds were to protect the people who were being harmed, at that point they were not thinking about their kids or wives..there was an allegence to the oath which unfortunately for many reasons has become watered down, and that is just a fact, because of this it is not expected for some to have to understand nor should they have to, that is the role of a peace keeper  This site is amazing for the variety of topics that are raised and discussed, it touches on issues that we all enjoy or have to deal with in life, that is what makes this board so strong"
962965,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-18 03:35:00,8243,"Not out of line. I agree 110%. If I had to hijack a go cart to see my family I would. This is getting ridiculous. It is an internet fishing forum for goodness sakes, not Dr. Phil but is starting to feel like it."
962969,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-18 04:13:00,8243,"Blizz I sent you a PM.  Beside the story I told you in the PM that is personal I'll add this one. Many of us here have lost family through their service to our country. My Grand Father took shrapnel to the head in WW1 serving for the Crown and had medieval surgery then to put a plate covering his skull and he couldn't talk when I met him in 60'. He was interned at Camp Pettawawa in 1939 until the end of WW2 as an enemy of the Crown. There aren't enough question marks here to put at the end of that sentence. Not one red cent in reparations. Man Blizz, you aren't the only person here with a hard luck story.  Go see your brother, you said you had the $$ to last month and put an end to this thread. I'm the guy that says what everyone else is thinking."
962977,Big Cliff,2016-03-18 08:20:00,6899,"It is a decision only you can make and it is yours alone to make. I can pick you up at the airport/bus terminal/whatever, we have a queen size port-a-bed in Sue's craft room (I've never slept on it but I understand it is quite comfortable) and as mentioned earlier it's under 30 min to Bobcayegon and we can even loan you a car while you are here.  If you do decide you want it to happen all you have to do is get to the Toronto area and I can take care everything else. I know you would do the same for me if the situation was reversed.  Peace be with you!"

962984,Steelheadphycho,2016-03-18 10:37:00,470,"  My sentiments exactly!  Your one of a kind Cliff!  I understand how you feel Blizz, but I think you should make your way down.......  Godspeed"
962990,Big Cliff,2016-03-18 10:50:00,6899,  Thanks for the kind words but I can assure you I am no Saint LOL. It just so happens that I live close enough and have the resources to be able to help out. I have no doubt that almost anyone on this site would do the same in similar circumstances if they had the opportunity.
963063,aplumma,2016-03-18 19:26:00,6896,I think the offers and information have run there course.  Thank you all for your input   Art
962833,mr blizzard,2016-03-17 01:08:00,1589,"So my wife and I just tried to get a hold of my ailing brother at a nursing home in  Bobcageon Ont  phoned and they said they would go down the hall and hold the phone while i talked to Don, they said I will call u back in 10 minutes, An hour later we call back an the to be nice broad said i did not hear back from u,,,,,,,then the receptionist said I have voice recognition and did not recognize your voice from the first phone call,,,,wth,,,,I said i want to hear my brothers voice before he expires, my wife and i both replied what is voice recognition, how many phone calls have u received from Yellowknife in the last hour,,,,,,,,,,,I asked please let me talk to my brother.

962836,mr blizzard,2016-03-17 01:29:00,1589,"I have never heard of a voice recognition specialist at a nursing home, can someone please help me as to who I can go to to resolve this, still shaking  Do I go to the lady premier or cbc or city or someone else,,,, been on this board a long time but my wife and I r fumming right now I am only sure and dont get me wrong but the new additions to this country are being treated well and Don who served with the rcmp opp mtp and lastly the peterborough police with a gun shot to his knee and the lady for better terms would not allow me to talk to my brother because she did not recognise my voice,,,she sounded like 23  Members of this board please help us if I cannot hear my brothers voice becauseof some nerd it will be sad and Art please dont lock this ,,,because some bimbo did not recognise my voice ,,,,who is she to intervene in my family"
962838,Fisherman,2016-03-17 01:32:00,7201,"Oh I feel for ya, that is beyond comprehension.  I'd be making some phone calls to the news."
962841,mr blizzard,2016-03-17 01:39:00,1589,"Oh I feel for ya, that is beyond comprehension.  I'd be making some phone calls to the news. Thank you Fisherman, only in my nightmares could someone under these circumstances ask for voice recognition,,, it is called Pinecrest in Bobcageon, the nursing home"
962842,adam lancia,2016-03-17 01:50:00,234,I'd call City tv
962844,mr blizzard,2016-03-17 01:57:00,1589,"I'd call City tv thank you for your support  please other members of this board the only one i belong to help  me, this is like kicking a dead dog cant believe this happened, not looking for vengance  just a serious apology want some legal advice"
962845,mr blizzard,2016-03-17 02:00:00,1589,I have saw 83 views i need the same info on how to resolve this please time is short
962846,HTHM,2016-03-17 02:01:00,4082,"If there is someone there who has a cell phone and can visit, have them call you and take out the middleman."
962850,ccmtcanada,2016-03-17 02:17:00,7971,I'd try talking to the manager or administrator first.  Explain your situation and see where that goes.  i feel badly that you have been unable to talk to your brother....and I sincerely hope you can very soon.
962852,FloatnFly,2016-03-17 02:30:00,1640,"well first, call the nursing home back asap, ask to speak to a manager, if they won't do anything, tell them you're going to call the MP immediately, and then a phone call to OPP, and then the news. and see what happens"
962853,Acountdeleted,2016-03-17 02:45:00,2562,I'd call back and tell them I was going to the news. explain how the situation will look to the public when this story airs. They'll change their minds real fast.
962854,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-17 02:49:00,8243,"Yes talk to the administrator, Gen. Manager etc. not some receptionist. Voice recognition technology, I don't think so. Going to the media isn't going to get you to talk to your brother. It will only become confrontational if it hasn't already."
962857,Joey,2016-03-17 03:31:00,9122,"Well that is outrageous.  I agree with the above comments, call back, ask for the manager, if no one can put you on the line with your bro, call the police and then call City TV.  Get this investigated and out there to the public.  I'd be fuming too and this is just not right!"
962859,Big Cliff,2016-03-17 08:57:00,6899,"OK, it's 4:50 am and I have to work today but I will be checking this thread as soon as I get home (mid to late afternoon probably).  Post on here if you have been able to talk to him otherwise; If it hasn't been resolved to your satisfaction by then, I'll drive over to Bobcayegon myself with my cell phone and you will hear from your brother (or I'll be in jail). PM me your phone number, brothers last name, a room number if you have one any other information you think might be helpful."
962861,manitoubass2,2016-03-17 09:17:00,11391," Sorry to hear john, id take cliff up on his offer if ya cant get a manager on the phone and figure this out.  Talk about an awful situation"
962876,miami,2016-03-17 12:36:00,29,"Phone and speak to the Administrator or the DRC (Director of Resident Care). Lodge a complaint because, Every Resident of a Long Term Care Facility have Rights, under the Long Term Home Care Act.  If your brother is competent, they have NO rights to deny your phone call to him. Inform the Administrator that you will be calling at a specific time TODAY and expect to speak to your brother. Lastly if this is a Long Term Care Facility (not a Retirement Home) file a complaint with the MOH (Ministry of Health) and LTC (Long Term Care). If you receive NO satisfaction today pm me and I will assist. If you require Phone Number(s) I will help you."
962877,Rizzo,2016-03-17 12:44:00,4754,"Bizarre. I have never heard of such a thing. I suppose they are trying to protect the residents from being preyed upon. Tell them they can monitor the call, stay right in the room while you speak to your brother. After a couple minutes of listening in they will see its a legit call and bugger off. I hope you have this figured out already."
962881,netminder,2016-03-17 13:04:00,514,I'm going to agree with Rizzo here. I usually give people the benefit of the doubt and would assume they're not being spiteful to you. Calling from NWT they likely didn't recognize the area code and thought it was a scammer. Stay calm and try to talk to a manager. Getting worked up and calling everyone from the MP/MPP to the Queen of England or the media or the police isn't going to make things better.
962886,mr blizzard,2016-03-17 13:56:00,1589,"Thanks everyone for your thoughts and suggestions The weird part is when I first called she being the receptionist asked a bunch of questions which I dont think she has a right to do and I dont mean generic questions about the weather etc which I could see as being some sort of screening  BUT my brother is too week to even hold a phone now so one of the workers has to be there anyways, she said she would call back in 10 minutes when she was in  the room with my brother  The part that got me challenged is when I called back after not hearing from her she started asking the same questions, are u your brothers age, what work did I do in Ontario, what work have u done in Yellowknife etc  Then she said I am sorry but I do not recognise your voice , it does not sound the same as when I last talked to you  and proceded to babble, I told her no disrespect but I dont want to talk to u I want to speak to my brother  At that point my wife even said over the speaker phone What if his brother isint around tomorrow,  he is phoning because he loves him  A few minutes later my wife phoned back and asked for the supervisors name, my wife was told that individual would be in today being the 17th, and finally someone went to his room so I could hear his voice  What a struggle I would not want to see anyones family treated like this, whether from the perspective of the one that is failing or from the ones that are trying to reach out to help and give reassuring words  I just got off the phone with the supervisor and she promised to look into the way things were handled and promised to get back to us  I am so glad my 90 year old mom is living at my sisters home  Thanks everyone for your input, it helped tremendously  Now go catch some fish this weekend"
962890,jimmer,2016-03-17 14:49:00,2730,"I'm glad to hear that you were finally able to hear your brothers voice. I would still inform the MPP in this area of the kind of treatment you received. The MPP for this area is Laurie Scott. I understand the need for precautions, but this sounds ridiculous as you said. I have heard so many horror stories from nursing homes, not something I am looking forward to ever having to access."
