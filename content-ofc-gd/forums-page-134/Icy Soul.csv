962652,lookinforwalleye,2016-03-15 16:11:00,4399,Nice work indeed!!!
962683,MJL,2016-03-15 23:05:00,2427,"Thanks guys...Glad you enjoyed the pics. With the milder temps this winter, it was the first year that my camera didn't freeze into a solid block of ice when I took it out of the hole   Those are great shots bud. Maybe I can get into one of them this fall.  Brian, it's not like I didn't have my camera gear with me last fall...You do need to catch a fish first...Just saying...    amazing as always Mike - very nice. We have to do a Lake Erie II (or if O cooperates a day fish closer to home)  this year, see if we cant find the target species... or at least something (yes, even a baaaaaa, ok?)  worth getting a photo of.  I've actually never caught that many sheepies or white bass in one day before...It was certainly one of my most favourite trips of 2015  I've got a few photography ideas to try out this season on the boat"

962712,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-16 04:19:00,8243,Those pics and others you have should be made into sealed Art posters. Have you had them published? If not you should. Another Dragon's Den contestant here. Come on guys lets back him here. I know there's $$ to be made.

962856,MJL,2016-03-17 03:04:00,2427,"Thanks again guys. Really appreciate it  One day I'd like to publish a book of my own on the various freshwater fish species found in Ontario. It's been a dream that I've had since I was a kid. This year my goal is to try to get as many pictures as I can of muskies, pike, walleye, panfish, smallmouth bass and various minnow species. I'm not much of a multi-species angler yet so we'll see  Those pics and others you have should be made into sealed Art posters. Have you had them published? If not you should. Another Dragon's Den contestant here. Come on guys lets back him here. I know there's $$ to be made.  I have had a few pictures published in magazines and books in the UK and US (primarily for carp fishing). I've been contacted by several Canadian/US based magazines over the past few years. We'll see how that goes   Absolutely beautiful shots man--Icy Gator-Kick for Freedom--if you ever produce posters-Kindly let me know-love to have a couple for our our office-Thanks !  Thanks for your kind words. In the past I've had a few pictures printed to hang on the wall as gifts as well as sold a few bigger prints to friends. It costed more than I would've liked. It's definitely an idea that I haven't stopped thinking about though. I did print out one of my trout pictures as a gift and gave it to a property owner on one of my favourite steelhead rivers...Nothing like scoring private access that I can fish in solitude  I do have a basic web-site up and running but it's primarily a small portfolio of my work to show interested editors or writers. Maybe one day I'll have a retail store (I haven't decided yet).  Thanks again guys  Mike"

Underwater: Canon 7D with an 8-15mm f/4L fisheye (I also sometimes use a Canon EF 20mm f/2.8 or an EF 60mm f/2.8 macro depending on the situation). I use an underwater housing + dome port + various accessories to keep everything dry.  I've thought about having my pictures printed in calendars in the past. Still thinking about various themes for each month.LOL"
963033,Steve,2016-03-18 15:31:00,2075,i truly appreciate the time you take to share your amazing adventures and photo's with us.  i really can't wait for your spring trout photo's!!!
963034,Steve,2016-03-18 15:36:00,2075,"Calendars really work well.  In 2011 I ensured I caught one good fish from every month of the year....  than put it together for a 2012 calendar and had it printed out at a proper print shop....  It turned out awesome, and it garnered much interest."

962526,MJL,2016-03-14 20:15:00,2427,"For me, the 2016 ice season has finally come to an end. Ice fishing isn't my favourite type of fishing, but it's way up there just behind my love of autumn steelhead fishing. When the lakes freeze over, it's one of the few times boat-less anglers (such as myself) can explore off-shore areas in search of fish. Sonars and really short fishing rods add to the excitement of hooking and landing large fish through the ice. Add to that, the fact that you have a large, (often crazy) fish doing donuts below the hole while you try to grab it, really gets the heart pumping. I never really played video games as a kid. Watching an aggressive laker on the sonar, shoot up 50 ft from the bottom and chase the lure another 30 feet before smashing it, makes up for all that I missed growing up  When I wasn't at work, I was probing the lakes with my friends and trying to catch whatever I could bring in through an 8"" hole. The 2016 ice season was more of a grinder for me with a lot of hours of hunting down fish VS actually catching them - Numbers were down for me this season. At least a fish or few made an appearance each trip to avoid the skunk.  As usual, I brought my cameras along with the hopes of capturing some interesting shots above and below the ice.
