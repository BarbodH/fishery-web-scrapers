962690,fishdawg,2016-03-16 00:05:00,912,  There is also a free Salmon Trolling Seminar going in the shop Friday night at 7pm with coffee being served
962713,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-16 04:27:00,8243,"Can't beat Grimsby tackle, Bill's Bait and Tackle, and Fishing World in Hamilton  Pleases support the local Mom and Pop stores rather than the big corporate stores like the American based Bass Pro and Cabellas etc. I bet they will meet the corporate stores prices if given the opportunity."
962714,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-16 04:28:00,8243,No free coffee at Bass Pro!
962756,Dutch01,2016-03-16 15:04:00,1431,LeBaron is tax free during the Sportsman's Show too.
962760,grimsbylander,2016-03-16 15:57:00,3016,"BPS and Sail are knowledge free all this week. Oh, and next week too."
962814,fishdawg,2016-03-16 22:16:00,912,^^^^ nailed it
962818,HTHM,2016-03-16 23:12:00,4082,No free coffee at Bass Pro! Go there on Saturdays and you can get a sausage too.
962819,Dutch01,2016-03-16 23:38:00,1431,"I have got some great deals at Sail, including price match bargains. I just make sure to do all my research first so I don't have any questions when I'm there."
962821,grimsbylander,2016-03-16 23:45:00,3016,"I have got some great deals at Sail, including price match bargains. I just make sure to do all my research first so I don't have any questions when I'm there.  They do have some goods deals and I'm all for a deal. As far as my earlier comment, it was 100% tongue in cheek. They're just people making an honest living and I can think of worse places to work. If I forget, I'll just read my resume."
962858,wormdunker,2016-03-17 07:20:00,1711,"Grimsby tackle is awesome!  Very knowledgeable staff.  I was shopping some tackle items at BPS.  2 days later went to Grimsby Tackle.  He is what I found.  Dipseys size 1 BPS  $22.00, Grimsby $17.00,  Humminbird Helix at BPS  $600.00, Grimsby $500.00.  Buffs BPS $28.00, Grimsby $17.00.  I've asked my family members NOT to purchase gift cards for me from BPS.  I'll support the smaller shops!"

What is their markup given their buying power and they charge more that Grimsby Tackle??"
962880,Dutch01,2016-03-17 12:58:00,1431,"I'm all for supporting the little guys, but in fairness big box stores do have higher overhead."
962884,manitoubass2,2016-03-17 13:22:00,11391,In NW ontario im so far from these stores.  Honestly thinking of opening a shop.  Right in the middle of the honey hole and its 100km to the nearest tackle shop
962891,LeXXington,2016-03-17 14:59:00,1928,Went to LB's for the no TAX sale.. found some good stuff at the price when the Canadian paso was higher.  BPS and Cabala's have already raised the cost on a lot of fast moving items as they restock.
962897,grimsbylander,2016-03-17 16:13:00,3016,"True, but it's their volume that covers their overhead. If it wasn't, they wouldn't build 300,000+ sqft stores, carry that inventory and hire accordingly. They sell some product cheaper than small stores can buy it. I know, I've seen it. But hey, that's ok, it's business and if I had a store that big, I'd want to have my inventory turns as high as possible too."
