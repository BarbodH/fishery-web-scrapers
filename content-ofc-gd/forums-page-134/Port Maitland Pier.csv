Mainly targeting perch and pike if any.  other in season fish as well if they bite.  Thanks"
962161,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-12 17:09:00,8243,Not much going on there at this time of the year. Far too early. End of April maybe.
962163,huzzsaba,2016-03-12 17:32:00,884,Thanks Old Ironmaker.  Would you by any chance know how the summer fishing is in the creek beside Port Burwell PP. I believe its otter creek or something. Just making sure to ask before I book a campsite
962211,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-12 22:11:00,8243,"No, I haven't a clue sorry Huzz, I've heard of Otter Creek that's about it. We go to Pt. Bruce down the road to get out on the lake for Perch a few times a year. The creek at Pt. Bruce has sheepshead and cats in the creek in the summer. Check out Stomps Long Point channel 6-8 fishing forum for that area. Plenty of info there.  I'm presuming you are camping there. Have you ever camped at Rock Point P.P. It is right next to the Grand in Port Maitland on the east side of the river. Plenty of shore fishing there in the summer."
962254,pics,2016-03-13 02:49:00,1268,There's a very short perch run in Port Maitland but by the time outsiders  find out its usually done.. I think the timing depends on the temperature..

Thanks for the suggestion.  I will considering camping there. And I will check out the forum you mentioned."
