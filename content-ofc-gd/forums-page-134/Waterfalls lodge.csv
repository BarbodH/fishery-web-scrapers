961740,Big Cliff,2016-03-10 12:01:00,6899,"Never been there but you are right, the reviews look good."
961748,Acountdeleted,2016-03-10 12:43:00,2562,"Not sure how much time you will have when you are there but if you have some free traveling time, check out 'Chutes Provincal park' just outside of Espanola. The fishing isn't great but the waterfalls are worth the trip. It's like an outdoor water park."
961759,Tjames09,2016-03-10 13:46:00,664,"Nope, sorry fellow ofc'er  Where bouts is it?  near Spanish River, just north of it, chain of lakes. About a 5 hour drive from GTA."

961846,NANUK,2016-03-10 23:30:00,797,"Been there a few times, very nice place, We'll run operation, Rob the owner is a great guy. excellent 16' Starcraft boats with floor, casting deck livewell, swivel seats with back rest, new (last year) Yamaha 20hp 4stk motors, and b&w sonars. Walleye fishing was very good early June, We had a great time. I heard they are making their lake C&R only this year, but I am not 100% sure."
962123,fisherman7,2016-03-12 13:26:00,325,Stayed there a few years ago. Rob is a great guy and very helpful. Boats/motors were top notch. We did the ATV trip to the back lake. That was a lot of fun.
