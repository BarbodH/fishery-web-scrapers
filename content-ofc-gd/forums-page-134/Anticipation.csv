I figure its a slow time of year and I may as well put a few pics up looking forward to a new season about to start.  A Monday night after work.             Other days            Where we got some...pretty big water , we traveled a lot    Late season for eyes and got a surprise.     Wishing everybody a great upcoming season  "
