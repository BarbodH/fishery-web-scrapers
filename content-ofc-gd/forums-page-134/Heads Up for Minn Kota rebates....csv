Its almost been a month and I had yet to receive even a tracking number so I contacted the above number.  I was inform there was 3 errors on my application for rebate - (on Minn Kota's side) as they confirmed my submitted information was perfect.  1) wrong rebate ($5 instead of $80) 2) invalid serial number (I included a photo just in case - they still made mistake) 3) wrong email address (cogeco.com instead of cogeco.ca)  They were very polite correcting the problem, gave me a tracking number and expedited the rebate. It still was a little disappointing to go through this as I double and triple checked my rebate information and even included printed photo's to negate any chance of mistakes causing delays.
