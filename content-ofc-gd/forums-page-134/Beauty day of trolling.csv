962263,Freshtrax,2016-03-13 06:26:00,2215,"Couldn't take it with with the weather so nice we had to splash the boat.  And when we got to the ramp at 6:30 we realized we weren't the only ones.  We had to get away from the pack  ( and the ass in the white Lund that wanted to troll up my bum and over my lines)       I have never tried spring Browns bufore but they are a funny fish they try and swim past the boat when you hook them. crazy buggers , makes it entertaining in the small boat .   This little football      And big fish of the day    Great to be out and catch a few fish. But it only gets better from here !"
