Man with the weight of the charger, 2 X 27 series deep cycle batteries and 80 LB Minn Kota Ipilot, Boat should plain out no problem  . Can't wait to try that Spot Lock jigging in 80 FOW."
962552,DRIFTER_016,2016-03-14 21:46:00,10439,My charger has been secured directly to an aluminum bulkhead in my boat using stainless screws for many years with no issues.

Now try mooring your aircraft at the end of a dock, with a 3600 volt submersible cable in the water under the float tips and a 52 volt DC phone line under the bows and you have yourself a sacrificial plating situation. Thankfully I noticed after 3 weeks on that dock a few years ago... but still have the severe pit marks to show it. Another 2 weeks or so and it probably would have sunk."
