961687,Fishwilly,2016-03-09 23:42:00,206,Can anyone tell me if it's open/usable?
961755,fishermccann,2016-03-10 13:16:00,655,"Where on Frenchmans Bay are you talking about? The beach on the east side spit, has large rocks placed so you cannot drive onto the bay in winter and those rocks prevent boat launching the rest of the year. Swans marina on the west side will let you launch there for a fee.  Still slushy ice on half the bay on east side."
961808,Fishwilly,2016-03-10 19:57:00,206,Thanks for the info fishermccann. We're just looking to launch a 16ft aluminum boat to fish the nuke plant.
961814,ehg,2016-03-10 20:54:00,2666,"Thanks for the info fishermccann. We're just looking to launch a 16ft aluminum boat to fish the nuke plant.  There is a spot on west side of the bay, road is right along shoreline. People launch into the bay. Check Google Maps etc...do your homework. Unless you get light northerly winds it is dangerous and sketchy. Have fished Pickering nuke plant a lot in past. It is only worthwhile sunrise or sunset. The light sends them running. Anyways, here is a post i did 3-4 yrs. ago that outlines how to have success. Check the weather and be prepared to bolt when wind picks up. http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=67005&page=1"
962611,ehg,2016-03-15 04:08:00,2666,"Thanks for the info fishermccann. We're just looking to launch a 16ft aluminum boat to fish the nuke plant. Not sure if you are still around but Friday, Saturday this weekend has winds straight from north or northwest. Best winds, peak time of year, even big rainbows start showing up with non-stop browns and white bass, Sunrise or sunset fish frenzy on lipless cranks etc..."
962616,Fishwilly,2016-03-15 10:10:00,206,Thanks for info ehg. Was down sunday and launched right at the marina. Ramp was unlocked and winds weren't too bad. Did manage a couple of steelhead but no browns. The water was so clear no colour at all.
962632,captpierre,2016-03-15 13:59:00,2521,"Used to fish there often in early spring. Minnows were the ticket. There is a large whirlpool just out from the the east outlet.  West outlet not as productive. Usually security would let you stay if you didn't anchor. Just kept the motor running and let the whirlpool take you in a big circle, occasionally using the motor to make adjustments. Lots of smallies, sheepshead, white bass and Browns. Can see tons of carp but they are hard to catch. Put a lively minnow on a hook and appropriate split shots depending on the current to drift along the bottom. Can't go wrong. Security can be fickle and might kick you out if you go too close to the outflow. Water coming out is warm. Maybe 12-15 C. Lake water 5-8 C. Stay safe."
962657,ehg,2016-03-15 16:45:00,2666,The key thing is to time it so your there at Sunrise or Sunset. The fish disappear between 9 am to 5 pm.
962660,captpierre,2016-03-15 17:04:00,2521,I used to do well mid afternoon. The only time I could go. I don't like using minnows. By buddy used them and smoked me 10:1 until I changed. The water is super clear. Fluoro leader also good idea.

The water is super clear. Fluoro leader also good idea. Fished nuke plant from boat maybe 50 times The only time i could go usually was early morning or sunset weekends luckily. Usually 30- 40 browns, bows, white bass, walleye, etc...at first light or night.  Tried midday and only managed a few snagged gizzard shad.  Would love to try Live Target baitball lipless crank in morn. night, this peak weekend."
962719,Freshtrax,2016-03-16 05:16:00,2215,I've been wanting to try this for years.   Thanks for the tips guys.
962724,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-16 07:39:00,8243,Never fished there but great posts guys.
962782,ehg,2016-03-16 17:58:00,2666,"I've been wanting to try this for years. Thanks for the tips guys. Have to make sure your first person there in morning or last to leave in evening. Make sure lights, powerful flashlight are good. Sunrise or sunset is so key. Have baitcasters, spinning combos tied and ready. Google Earth is your friend. Wish i had that 20 yrs. ago."
962802,Joeytier,2016-03-16 20:17:00,3990,"Caught tons of fish there midday, especially with an onshore wind and green water.  Had lots of days where minnows and roe were the only things moving fish.  Can also put out boards with Cleo's and raps for when things slow down.  That plant is on borrowed time so get out there while you can."
962817,ehg,2016-03-16 22:59:00,2666,"I've been wanting to try this for years. Thanks for the tips guys. Can't stress enough that for first time try to be there sunrise or sunset.  Noon or midday will have you out in big lake thinking it sucks.  Check out my old post tons of doubleheaders mixed species. Always was there sunrise or sunset get your place quick in east side outflow.  Never had to use live bait just lipless cranks, shad or shadow raps."
962820,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-16 23:39:00,8243,"We miss the warm water discharge from the Nanticoke Hydro plant. Shut down now for about 4 years. When you dropped a line you never knew what was going to hit. April was Silver Bass time, big ones. You call them White Bass.  I am not going to miss the Browns this year on the west end of Lake Ontario. Do you think the same tactics and presentations at the west end of the lake between Grimsby and Dalhousie would it be the same as where you guys went or go?  Oh and a great report from 2012 there ehg, thanks."

962971,ehg,2016-03-18 06:01:00,2666,"Pretty simple fishing there. Once you get to flow, troll to the top of flow discharge Put motor in neutral and drift back out and cast hardware, cranks etc. Get there right time it's fish caught trolling in, fish caught drifting out. Everyone there is friendly, orderly, chatty...and catching stuff."
