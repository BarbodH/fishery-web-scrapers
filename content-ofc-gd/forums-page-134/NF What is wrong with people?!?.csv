962431,Rizzo,2016-03-14 12:40:00,4754,you'd certainly hope it wasn't intentional....but because of the 2nd incident sure sounds like it was
962437,leaf4,2016-03-14 13:20:00,2466,"Yeah I heard of that, the guy claims he was blackout drunk, that's a sad excuse"
962479,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-14 15:52:00,8243,Crocodile tears from the guy. Sure he's sorry. Alcoholism is a huge problem especially amongst Aboriginals. Sad.
962483,Acountdeleted,2016-03-14 16:12:00,2562,"If it were all just minor injuries I could see maybe them having mercy, but he killed an animal.  If that dog were a member of my team that I had when I guided in Canmore I'd want to kill the guy. They were like family to me."
962486,AKRISONER,2016-03-14 16:16:00,5558,"i honestly believe that he was too drunk to even know. Its no excuse obviously because hes responsible for being that drunk in the first place, but holy crap hes lucky no one died."
962738,bow slayer,2016-03-16 13:10:00,1074,"stupid....there is no other word to describe people who make choices like this,charge him with dui along with the other charges."
962746,MJL,2016-03-16 14:08:00,2427,Very sad...I've been following the iditarod for the last 10 years. I have no doubt that incident was the deciding factor of the winner of that race. I believe Aliy Zirkle was running second when she was hit and Jeff King (4 time champion and consistently in the top 10) was running 5th and closing in fast on the leaders. Would've loved to see Aliy win her first iditarod after several 2nd place finishes.
