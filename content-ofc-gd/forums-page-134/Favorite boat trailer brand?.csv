962530,davey buoy,2016-03-14 20:20:00,5505,I check all my nuts and bolts every spring the first time I take the boat off the trailer. Once and a while you find a loose one.  S. That's what I'm talking about !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
962545,Mister G,2016-03-14 21:15:00,1429,That's what I'm talking about !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had a TeeNee boat trailer under my last boat and it lasted almost 30 years without any of problems some of these newer  E-Z Loader Trailer owner's  are experiencing.......... As a matter of fact if I did have all those problems I would be very upset because this is not rocket science stuff.......it's just a simple boat trailer ! ! !

962569,FishAbout,2016-03-14 23:00:00,106,The dealer is should be doing PDI on the trailer before it is sold.

962662,aplumma,2016-03-15 17:38:00,6896,If you are having issues with sticky bunkers this is a product that works almost to well.  http://www.amazon.com/MaryKate-Liquid-Rollers-Trailer-Lubricant/product-reviews/B00144EZJ8  I use it on my Ranger and it loads with a light turning of the winch.   Art
962688,ecmilley,2016-03-16 00:00:00,2163,"rangertrail trailer are pretty much the snizzile for loading and unloading a boat even make a rookie look good using them, six bunks rock solid contruction only real weak point is the built in retractable wheel at the front my 92 trailer still on original bunks and carpet grease cleaned yearly any of the better trailers that have six bunks are a charm to load and unload in the bassboat world i seldom use the winch to loaded it almost always drive on have split a few rollers lol"
962733,bow slayer,2016-03-16 12:49:00,1074,I have a 14 year old ezloader and other than replacing rubber and bearings it has been great.
962735,16 Footer,2016-03-16 12:55:00,191,I have a Cradle Ride trailer for the past 12 years. The price was good and they custom built it for me at no extra charge. It has metal fenders that I can stand on. Not galvanized but the paint has held up well. The only problem I had was a wheel bearing needed replacement along with the race which I replaced myself.
962888,BillM,2016-03-17 14:09:00,17367,"ShoreLand'r here, no complaints really, I just wish it was galvanized and not powdercoated.  Back roads make a mess of it pretty quick (I'm getting tired of repainting it, lol)"

962273,Mister G,2016-03-13 12:19:00,1429,"A galvanized OR a Tundra (a Line X type of coating) coated trailer is a good idea here in our weather..  Bunks are usually a better choice to support your boat's hull........rollers have the tendency to punch the hull where they are, especially if you travel over bad roads."
962276,Roy,2016-03-13 12:31:00,13728,"I think they're all pretty good.....a lot are made by the same people. The important thing in my opinion is how the boat sits on the trailer whether it be roller or bunk supports. You'll pay a little more for a galvanized trailer but they're worth it in the long run. I also prefer a belt on the winch rather than a steel cable. One or more of the steel strands on the cable will eventually fray and break and you'll end up stabbing yourself with it every time you handle the cable. If you're short on storage for the trailer, you might want to look at swing away tongues. Another useful option is the spring loaded transom tie downs (stainless steel). Good luck in your search. Let us know hat you get."
962278,fishnguy,2016-03-13 12:44:00,96,Thanks G and Roy.  Appreciate that.  Will update.
962291,glen,2016-03-13 14:32:00,2641,Check the thickness of the steel.  I've seen some that are so thin they rust out quick.
962301,Steve,2016-03-13 15:43:00,2075,"TOO MANY cheap boat trailers out there....  If you want a good trailer, one that will last, can be used in the cold (ie, no plastic fenders), good strong box tubing, you will likely need to go custom.  I have a 17' boat that I too am looking to replace the trailer....  I can pay as little as $1,400 for the trailer...but as soon as I start talking to the salesman/manufacturer, I'm quickly into a $3K trailer."
962316,fishnguy,2016-03-13 17:46:00,96,"@Glen- What thickness would you recommend.  @Steve- Was there a brand you liked over the others?  Also, I'm hoping for a trailer with oversized tires for some really rough launches in my area.  My current trailer has very little clearance and gets hung up on rocks.  Anyone had that problem, and is there one particular brand that has more clearance than others?  Thanks."

Are there any brands that forum members have had bad experiences with and would avoid?  Many thanks!  I'm on my second EZ loader. First one '99. Then I purchased a whole new package in 2012. Absolutely no issues with either. New outfit is much heavier. Tough for an old guy like me to winch it onto a bunk trailer. Initially I would back in deep. Wet the bunks then get situated. The wet bunks made things a little easier. After consulting my dealer, I purchased these: http://www.basspro.com/Bunk-Slick-Boat-Trailer-GlideOns/product/1111100500571/  Talk to a reputable dealer.  He may recommend rollers over bunks based on the weight of your boat."

We have a winch,hopefully a strong frame,one axle for the most part?. What I like is how it has deterred rust since 86 . Just some surface rust.Cleaned up and all is good. Mine has rollers for a 3500 plus boat. Bearings can be replaced . The frame is the most important part for lasting long.Everything else is replaceable .Good luck on your search. Too add,bolts will come loose,you need to check them out once and a while till they get a nice rust on them lol."
