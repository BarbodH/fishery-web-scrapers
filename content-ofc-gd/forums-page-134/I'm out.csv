962102,pics,2016-03-12 03:49:00,1268,I'd love to make a move away from the city.. I'm sitting in my machine tonight overlooking the harbor and skyway bridge thinking the amount of traffic is truly mind boggling .. at 6:30 the QEW was almost stopped. I can't imagine doing that every day. I grew up in different areas of the city and it wasn't until I lived out in blackheath(past Binbrook) that I realized I wanted to live on a farm. My current home is on the edge of the city that seems closer every year. Since my wife won't go North my best bet is going towards Niagara where it's more affordable.. anything with a bit of acreage here is a million and up. We are both tied to our jobs so the commute is an important part of the decision. In a perfect world we could make decent money somewhere with great fishing and hunting nearby ..that isn't my reality unfortunately....
962105,limeyangler,2016-03-12 04:11:00,5204,"NWO in my opinion…. we  moved house from 4000 miles away with no jobs and no house to come to, 10 years later we are still here, on the lake, 7 acres, $20000 less per year…..but money counts for $%#@ if you are miserable. I fish everyday, can drive my truck anywhere, traffic jams are when deer cross the road, my kid can play outside anytime, my only neighbour pops round for a chat, we fish together, help each other out etc. I grew up in the city (London, England) 13 million people jammed together in filth….horrible, can't understand why people are so wedded to the insanity."

My whole family still lives there. My wives sister lives on Lake Ramsey in Sudbury. So I know Sudbury very well also. Both places have lots of rural fishing close at hand. Different country I'll admit. Sudbury more rocky and rugged. Fergus more farmland but lots of unspoiled area close by.  If at any point you are at all serious do yourself a favour and go spent some time in Sudbury. It is a city in every way and very comparable to anything in the GTA. So if you are looking to get away from the city you would have to live outside Sudbury to do that....maybe 30minutes to an hour outside the city....which is where you already are in Fergus...30 minutes to an hour outside the GTA. I'm not trying to rain on anyones parade. Just pointing out the similarities and urging you to do your due diligence  before you make a decision."
961794,T-Bone,2016-03-10 18:05:00,160,"Nice. I love Toronto, but only visit there...not sure I could live there for all the reasons listed. It's my dream to retire in Canada (live in states) for a number of reasons, not the least of which is to get into an environment that is much-less pressure cooked....and the fact that living in the U.S. anymore is just downright frightening (take a look at our current presidential campaign for proof). For me, Haliburton and north, but probably not too far north of the Timmins latitude. That is unless I land in Nipawin, SK....can't be much going on up there...which is the #1 goal..."

961834,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-10 22:37:00,8243,I love Sudbury. We played up there once every season and if we didn't show up we could still beat them. To compare Sudbury to T.O. is a stretch. I wouldn't live in either place.   Yes Toronto is the centre of the Universe. And because of Torontonians we have our Liberal Gov. at Queens Park. If you live there you better make at least 6 figures. If I still had the place across from Hyde Park when I lived there in the 70's I would be a millionaire. The only thing I miss of Toronto is the El Macambo on Spadina.

I was there a few years back and it seemed a nice enough place)  The guys were sitting around having a few pints and shooting the breeze and shoveling the stuff that usually gets shoveled. Conversation turns to the places they have lived and worked. Joe in the corner mentions Sudbury. Bob, 2 seats away says ""Sudbury!! Sudbury!! The only things that ever came out of Sudbury are whores and hockey players"".  Mario, sitting across the table says ""I beg your pardon! That's where my mother is from"". To which Bob says ""So what team did she play for?"""

I have been to Sudbury numerous times, worked there on several occasions, including a 9 month stint.  I'd go back in a heart beat!  1.5 hour drive north on the hwy 144 is the most amazing fishing I have experienced, not to mention hunting, hiking, snowmobiling, ATVing & the great outdoors in general.  Dara I need an explanation for your comment.  Once in the city you have every restaurant, bar & shopping facilities that most bigger cities offer.  Don't bash Sudbury unless you've been there for more than a week.

961899,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-11 02:41:00,8243,I went online today and the El Macambo is under renovation. What was this thread about? Man I need to get out on the water ASAP.
961901,irishfield,2016-03-11 02:45:00,26272,They can renovate that place all they want (been at it for over 3 years) and the toilets will probably still back up!
961903,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-11 02:48:00,8243,"Actually I was surprised it was un renovation, closed on 14', with the price per square in TO downtown I thought another glass tower would be there already."
961914,Dara,2016-03-11 03:25:00,3052,"OK, first off, I believe manitou bass added Sudbury to his list at my suggestion  Oldironworker..I grew up SE of Broadview and Gerard..DeGrassi St if you can believe it.  W Dunker  I did 2 stints in Sudbury for about 6 months each...needed weeks for pokie  In the winter staying in a motel, I used to fill a cooler with snow to keep my coffee cream and a couple of beverages cold..the grease and soot from that snow torned the inside of a white cooler a black gooey mess...had to toss it out. Its the only city in the country that has bi yearly conferences to bring your car in and get a voucher for a free paint job because the fallout ate the paint off it.  Summer, it is the dirtiest city I have ever seen and the roads are the worst anywhere. You have to drill and blast to have a basement or sewer line...need I go on? Oh yeah..the traffic...I would rather drive in Toronto during gay pride weekend"
961936,wormdunker,2016-03-11 09:21:00,1711,"Dara - Yah I have to agree about the poor conditions of the roads.  The traffic can be very busy along La Salle Blvd & surrounding streets at rush hour, but the key is avoid travelling those areas at 5:00 pm.  While employed there I would usually work 7 - 3:30 so traffic wasn't an issue for me.  If I was driving a crane down the street late afternoon during rush hour I didn't care, I was getting paid premium time until I returned to the shop.  Thursday night I would pack my camping & fishing gear & head north up the #144 right after work on Friday - camp, fish all week end!  Doesn't get any better!   I'm not aware of the fallout you describe.  I know Extrada smelter (previously Falconbridge) & Vale (used to be Inco) have spent billions on upgrading pollution & environmental issues.  Back in the early 70s there wasn't a tree or even scrub brush to be seen, just bare rock!  Today there is a lot of greenery to be viewed every where.  Blueberries are abundant & the largest I've ever witnessed!  Also I was able to jump on my sled or ATV, drive up to my buddies home (2 Kms), go out his back gate & be on the OFSC trails & travel for hundreds of miles.  In Fonthill I was stopped by the cops for riding my atv down the shoulder of the road.  From my home it's a 7 - 8 hour drive to some of my favourite lakes north of Sudbury.  I know I'm only discussing the outdoor activities here.  But, is there anything better?? Rick - I'll get back to you when I have a little more time to discuss plans for LOTW."
961938,manitoubass2,2016-03-11 10:04:00,11391,Yes sir! And when you mentioned it It brought back memories of one of my best friends that worked there lol. He hates that place wuth a passion. Said it was just like thunderbay. Thats all I need to hear to stay away???

Now the best fit for us is a small town an hour or so out of the GTA in the Kawartha's. Able to walk to everything we need with a nice small town atmosphere and only an hour or so from anything we might need in the city. Best of both worlds.  To the original OP. Enjoy your move and the new environment. We only get to do this dance once so we might as well enjoy it the best we can.

As far as winter and black flies go, the Sault is great being moderated by lake Superior and lots of snow is just plain fun in the winter.  I hear you guys on work though...south is where all the real good jobs are  armpit, you need a little boat, atv and a snowmobile and you will love it"

Do you really thing that all the rural people could get the services they enjoy in our fine province without the GTA? The roads they drive on  without traffic without the GTA? Schools hospitals paid for by the locals in Timmons? Traffic, crime and all the rest of the crap that comes from big city living sucks indeed and nobody likes it its true. But this city carries the entire province. I wish stuff was based on the amount we pay... As far as the permission goes, people describe themselves as partners these days, and therefore compromise is often necessary. Everyone says ""oh shes not the right one"" I make the rules! My wife makes 6 figures,but neither of us would want to live somewhere that makes the other miserable...

I'm in Fonthill (near St. Catharines) & enjoy our small town very much.  Now that our family is grown & with 3 grandchildren it would be extremely difficult to move too far north & not be able to visit the Kiddies as often.  As I approach retirement my plan is to purchase a trailer in a park up north whereby wifey & myself could spend a month or so enjoying the great outdoors but maintain our home in Fonthill.

961505,Big Cliff,2016-03-08 20:56:00,6899,"Seems like allot of fellow members are on the move lately. I'm another one to get as far away as possible from the gta. Packing up and moving to the Timmins area at the end of the month. Had enough of the people ,traffic, and battle fishing weekend warriors on any lake less than a 3 hour drive. Can't wait to slow down the pace of life and enjoy my time outdoors. Any one in the area want to be a guide would love to learn some new spots. Always an open seat in the boat for anyone willing to share some local knowledge. Cheers fellas some solid fish posts coming this year. Good for you and good luck!  wish i could do that too  good luck  All it takes is the desire to do it!  if only the fiance would let me do this lol  i tried to convince her to move to my home town Flin Flon manitoba, i had a good job lined up and everything but no dice lol. You my friend are pussy whipped! You don't ask, you go, if she is the right one she will come with you if she isn't then it is better to part company now!"
961506,JoshS,2016-03-08 21:08:00,729,Good for you. I've been thinking long and hard about the move away too. Nothing worse than snailing through GTA traffic on route to the lake. My lady is in social work so will be tough for her to find good work but it is out there. Friends and family can come visit on the weekends. Now to find the right venture to be self employed...
961507,davey buoy,2016-03-08 21:09:00,5505,"I would do that in minute with or without. My two boys are at that older age where things could happen lol.That's what is keeping me here for the most part.Good luck sir,and all the best."
961509,netminder,2016-03-08 21:22:00,514,I really should look for employment in the north. It's a dream of mine to get as far from the GTA as possible some day soon. Good luck with the move and congratulations.
961510,AKRISONER,2016-03-08 21:23:00,5558,"Good for you and good luck!   All it takes is the desire to do it! You my friend are pussy whipped! You don't ask, you go, if she is the right one she will come with you if she isn't then it is better to part company now!  lol cliff arent you the one thats selling the house on the lake?  and weve already had the talk about it, currently her career wouldnt allow for her to make a move like that, and its a bit ridiculous to ask someone to give up their career to go and sit up north and do nothing.  She already knows that once its time to have kids etc, then we will definitely be moving somewhere much quieter"
961512,muddler,2016-03-08 21:28:00,623,"Good for you.  I moved back home (Northern Ontario) 8 years ago after the divorce. I love every minute of here. Fishing and hunting are close by. The pace is a lot slower and the people are a lot nicer.  My over all health improved quickly and I can't wait to wake up in the morning. Jobs are a lot harder to find, but I never planned on being rich anyway.  You won't need a guide(that's GTA talk) up there once you get to know the locals. They'll show you everything in due time.  Live every day and have a blast.  muddler"

She already knows that once its time to have kids etc, then we will definitely be moving somewhere much quieter Yes, I am the one selling the house on the lake but I am now 70 LOL. We are selling it because we have lived my/our dream for the last 16 years and now our dream is becoming reality. The reality is that I can no longer do the things that are necessary to manage a place like this. Don't sit around and wait for the ""right time"", the only thing you will get from that is missed dreams and opportunities!  I do apologize though, what is right for me isn't right for everyone, I am sure your lady is worth whatever you are willing to do to make it all happen! I wish you and her nothing but the best!"

961516,Old Ironmaker,2016-03-08 22:02:00,8243,"Fantastic move for you. You only get 1 shot at life so live it to the fullest that you can.  Akrinsoner. As far as a fiancé ""giving permission"" oh my oh my. You might want to shop around or phrase your situation a little differently. Permission, I give permission not get permission, then do as I'm told. Seriously though it's no way to start a relationship by getting her permission or thinking you need her permission, no way whatsoever. Get back to us in 10 years and let us how it all worked out."
961518,landry,2016-03-08 22:19:00,1005,You old guys are from a different generation. Times and women have changed. Most work full time and have 50% vote on life plans. Us younger guys missed the good ol days. Having said that - I never ask to go fishing or give a Time when I will be home. But I do try to be a Fair partner. Just because his wife won't move to Flin Flon doesn't mean the guy is whipped. Tough crowd.
961519,LostAnotherOne,2016-03-08 22:21:00,956,"I made that decision last year and here we are now on 1 acre.  Its not whole lot, but it works for us.  No neighbours in sight.  Just decided why not and went for it."

You are moving to a beautiful area, and the best thing you can do is distance yourself from the GTA.  The GTA has done more to erode what this great province had been in the past.  You are a lucky man!"
961525,Rod Caster,2016-03-08 22:37:00,5784,"LOTS of great fishing up there. Your fishing life will bever be the same, in a good way! Welcome to the north"
961534,leaf4,2016-03-08 23:55:00,2466,"Nice, congratulations... If there was bountiful construction work in areas like that I wouldn't be in the city, but that's the way she goes for now! The best I can hope for is a nice country lot not far from the city"
961537,smitty55,2016-03-09 00:05:00,928,"You my friend are pussy whipped! You don't ask, you go, if she is the right one she will come with you if she isn't then it is better to part company now! That made me laugh. Well said Cliff. Post of the year right there. In my case I would ask first out of respect but there better be a real strong reason to say no.  It's a two way street right? All this ""happy wife, happy life"" is a crock IMO. I went out with a nice gal for 5 years, then she started complaining about my hunting and fishing. CYA babe."
961538,mitch seguin,2016-03-09 00:26:00,98,I lived there for 15 years and spent my time on lakes where occasions seeing another angler were few and far between.  You will enjoy.
961544,Moosebunk,2016-03-09 01:39:00,3970,"Live 35 minutes outside of Ottawa and that's still too close.  The GTA or Ottawa Valley is surely is like anywhere urban and that's no place to be really.  Good for you for making the move, Timmins ain't all that bad a choice either.  Pretty country any direction on the compass."
961554,GBW,2016-03-09 02:36:00,8460,Congrats.  If my kids were older (20's vs 9 and 12 now) I'd be gone too.  Lindsay isn't far enough North for me...  I even thought of buying a home just up the road from M2B in the Emo area but not right now...
961579,Dara,2016-03-09 13:11:00,3052,"The family move here from downtown Toronto when I was 15 and I have never looked back.  Work wasn't always easy to find, had to go to Sudbury a couple times over the years but thats about it. I can snowmobile, fish, hunt and go to concerts or games whenever. We have every store that is in the south..just one of each instead of 20. No lineups for anything except Timmies  I told my daughter once a few years ago that I was thinking of moving south again, London area..she said, give your head a shake Dad...so I did..dumb idea  Timmins is a pretty decent area...enjoy your life there"
961583,bigugli,2016-03-09 13:23:00,6138,"Getting away from the GTA was a good thing for us some 25 years back. Rural Niagara was pretty rural back then. Far too many subdivisions going up now, but the fishing is decent. Getting too long in the tooth to think of going back to rural any more. With the Mrs being hospitalized almost every year, my family needs that proximity to complex healthcare that one cannot find in the rural north.  It is a healthier, freer lifestyle.  Enjoy."
961585,tomkat,2016-03-09 13:36:00,246,Think I would rent for a while to make sure.
