504055,Fisherpete,2010-09-15 02:37:00,1814,"No probs! One more observation from this summer... glass calm lake + sunny skies = yech. Need a bit of a chop on the water... some clouds, or even better, totally grey and overcast... throw in a light drizzle and now we're talking!!!  As for the map thing - seriously, on the way up to Sturgeon I grabbed one of those maps that you find at every general store in the Kawarthas, looked at the general lake area where we were launching for MAYBE a total of 5 minutes and out we went. Nice when things go just as planned! Were we lucky that day? Absolutely. But even a bit of planning or research on the lake can improve your odds greatly."
504067,Nipfisher,2010-09-15 03:20:00,2449,"Great advice Fisherpete. Now what would you look for on a map to hold muskie? Did you fish weed beds, river / creek mouths, saddles between islands or islands and shore, shorelines? this kind of generic info is super helpful to us muskie fisher want-to-bes."
504070,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-15 03:33:00,932,Beauty Report Pete and a Great Season For Sure.  Best of Luck Getting 50 This Fall!
504071,vinnimon,2010-09-15 03:33:00,2593,"All I can say pete, since Im a south paw,2 thumbs up for ya Captain . NOW !!!!!GO GET THAT 50 incher!!!!!"
504080,Fisherpete,2010-09-15 08:42:00,1814,"weed beds - yes river / creek mouths - yep although this hasn't been productive for me saddles between islands or islands and shore - yes shorelines - yes  One key thing I have found is to have some deeper water nearby... on many Kawartha lakes this often only means 15-20 ft.  4:30am Wednesday morning, I'm packing the boat right now... c'mon OFC peeps, send me some karma today while I am out there so I can get that GIANT!!!"
504081,solopaddler,2010-09-15 09:31:00,8605,Impressive fish to say the least!  (And some good pointers on where/how in your replies)

504152,Gregoire,2010-09-15 17:25:00,1397,"You've had a great year so far Pete. I recognize a few of those fish for sure. Your posts make ke itch to get out even more, just wish I had more time."

503764,mepps,2010-09-14 12:06:00,1301,Awesome stuff! To bad we didn't get you that 40 inch pike in May!
503767,Andy,2010-09-14 12:24:00,330,"Wow! Very impressive. Not looking for secrets, but I was wondering if you'd be willing to share any observations you have made about lures this past season. For example, did bigger lures take the bigger fish, or did you catch them on a variety of lure styles and sizes. I was on a Kawartha lake last weekend, and did well for me, but the biggest I caught was 38"". My biggest lures are around 8"". I have a bunch of 6"" lures that I'm thinking about selling, I find myself wishing I had bigger lures. I guess what I'm asking is the age old question ""Does size matter, or is it how you use it?"" Andy"
503768,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-14 12:36:00,2690,"..........that first blank space, was me wiping the drool away from my chin   Well done, Pete.  Absolutely stellar year for 'skis.  That 50 can't be far off!"
503776,mepps,2010-09-14 13:03:00,1301,Any of these Rockstar fish??
503810,muskeybugged,2010-09-14 14:23:00,282,"Great year that's for sure.... But 4 of the top 6 came to your old boat.....  All the best on the search for 50"" this fall  Thanks for sharing"
503813,Smarty Pantz,2010-09-14 14:32:00,203,"All I can say is WoW WoW WoW & like frankie said above....I was almost drooling LoL!!   Way to go, great catches! Never caught a muskie in my life.........yet!!!!"
503814,kickingfrog,2010-09-14 14:34:00,8333,Very impressive.  Did I see a lure in one of those photos?
503861,Fisherpete,2010-09-14 17:11:00,1814,"You absolutely see a lure in the last pic... but if you notice, it is one one of the rods not in use. I have had that Believer (8"" fire perch) for 9 years, given it plenty of fishing time, and it has only caught one darn ski, a 33. I know they are supposed to be great muskie lures, but not for me!  Clive - I have caught some skis and a bunch of pike on Rockstars this year, but none in my top 10. That will likely change in the fall as the water cools down...   remember my PB 47"" on a Rockstar from last October?"
503872,Lunkerhunter,2010-09-14 17:42:00,455,lots of great looking ski's there pete... we still gotta get out there sometime this fall if your up for it. it sure has been a great year for muskie's.  cheers
503970,Leecher,2010-09-14 23:45:00,7832,"Very impressive Pete.... congratulations Now go get that 50""er will you already Thanks for sharing Leechman"
503973,danbouck,2010-09-14 23:49:00,4380,Awesome season!
503989,Fisherpete,2010-09-15 00:14:00,1814,"Andy - lure size didn't seem to really matter - the second biggest one was caught on a 6"" lure... and I have caught some baby muskies (20-25"") this year on a 12"" lure! They are not too smart... but aggressive. Put it near them, big or small, and they will often take a chomp at it. My not so secret strategy? Location, location, location... In mid-June, I fished a section of Sturgeon for a day, had never been there before... just looked at a map, guesstimated which locations would make sense to hold muskies and fished them hard... ended up with 8 that afternoon including a 44 within 5 minutes of getting there! It can be applied to any lake... and as you spend more time on the water, you will figure out those 'spots on a spot'.  Lunkerhunter - what is your actual name by the way LOL! - for sure we should get out soon. Are you a weekend warrior or can you get out on weekdays too? Send me a pm... Oh, and guess what I went out and bought again? Yup, that same Frabill 60"" cradle that I sold you! I missed it for dealing with small to medium fish, and prefer it when fishing with a partner. It often seems to hasten the release process. My Stowmaster will still be good for solo trips and for monster fish though...  Dan - the season is just beginning...   Just wait..."
504052,Andy,2010-09-15 02:13:00,330," I appreciate your response. ""just looked at a map, guesstimated which locations would make sense to hold muskies and fished them hard"" That statement makes perfect sense, but it's one thing to say it, and another to take the time and make the effort to follow through with it. A lot of us are too busy or impatient to put in the effort you do, and spend our time looking for the ""hot"" lure or blaming the weather, etc. You were rewarded for your efforts, congratulations, and thanks again. By the way, I have yet to catch a fish of any kind on a Believer or Swimm Whizz, and I have given it a far share of time in the water.  Andy"
