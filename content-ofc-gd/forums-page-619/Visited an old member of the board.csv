I had to drop the boat off this morning and figured I would head over to the Elmvale feed mill since I needed some feed,for the deer, not me. I dont get out that way much,but when I do,I pop by to say hello.  Driving into town, I pull into Timmies.As Im about to pull out, I see this sign,holly,he,s not small time anymore, and he,s moved to a bigger shop. So busy,boats are lined up and getting worked on.No time for internet and limited to fishing too. He,s into winter storage and winterizing now too  . Told him next year he,s got my bussiness.  Sure was nice to meet up again.  Some will know him by the sign.  "

513969,misfish,2010-10-22 19:10:00,29133," He now has an apprentice working with him Wayne.Maybe he thinks,he can get away when he,s good enough.   On a side note,I found out that manure spread onto a field and covered with snow,is not easy to drive on.Almost got stuck.Thought I was going to have to use the corn for traction,but just made it out."

514080,Rattletrap2,2010-10-23 00:30:00,1652,I remember Chris. Good to hear things are going well for him!
