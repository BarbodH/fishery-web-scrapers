513444,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-20 22:07:00,0," What do you mean? Every team that plays the same team back to back, wins one and loses one. The leafs won the first game against the Rangers so if the trend continues, they will lose the second one. But like I said. Trends are meant to be broken. Just like Avery's face!lol"
513555,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-21 03:00:00,4399," You are a little confused Mr.Bass, Verbeek is in his mid 40`s and has been retired for many years. Versteeg on the otherhand is a useful 50 point guy and with all due respect the Leafs do not have two great lines. There have been a few teams in the past that had two great lines but IMHO 2010/11 Leafs come up a little short in the great department, lets see if they can make the playoffs before we start calling them great besides if they have two great line then making the playoffs will be a walk in the park."
513587,solopaddler,2010-10-21 13:34:00,8605," You may be right, maybe not.  Tell you one thing though, I wouldn't trade the entire Leafs team straight up for your Habs.  Not in a million years.  I like where we're at a lot better."
513602,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-21 15:12:00,0," Oh That! I asked my brother when the next game was and he said Wednesday! Boy was I disappointed when I found out it was Thursday.LOL    Oops sorry. I type fast. Ya, he can be useful on the second line too. Move up Kulemin. Not many Russian forwards that can't score and he has the potential to be a 20+ goal scorer. Or move up Macarthur who has been hot.  And the second line will be Grabovski, Versteeg and Armstrong. Versteeg is not that far away from these guys in regards to points accumulated in their careers."
513623,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-21 16:30:00,4399, That`s fine your certainly entitled to your opinion however wrong it is!!!LOL We went to the the conference finals last year and you didn`t.
513625,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-21 16:34:00,4399,"  Colby Armstrong is an interesting player he has averaged 14 goals and 35 points in 5.5 seasons, I would say Colby Armstrong`s strongest atribute is his agent."
513632,uglyfish,2010-10-21 16:56:00,981,"A players value isn't always measured by goals, assists and points.  and to whoever mentioned moving versteeg to the second line ""if his play doesn't improve"" are u serious? Do u watch hockey at all?? He's been one of the best players on the ice each nite. He's creating turnovers and scoring chances. His goals will come, don't worry about that"
513638,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-21 17:09:00,4399,  Again we went to the conference finals and you didn`t!!!
513733,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-21 22:28:00,0," He seems to be a real good pick pocket too. He stripped quite a few players of the puck.  Here are his stats in the NHL. 5.5 seasons? Looks more like he only played 3 full seasons to me.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colby_Armstrong  And I wouldn't be surprised at all if he passed the 20 goal mark again this year, playing on a decent line.  How many goals/points does one have to score to be on the second line?"
513734,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-21 22:33:00,0," Kessel, as I stated before the season began is a scoring machine. He has no one even near his caliber to play with on the team.  Bozak is mister faceoff. He creates a lot of scoring chances deep in the offensive zone. And he has been setting up Kessel, if you haven't noticed.  Much later in the season we look at scooping up a few free agents, but lets give these kids time to prove themselves. They are playing well."
513735,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-21 22:34:00,0," And he cant create those scoring chances on the second line? On the first line so far, all he has is a goal and an assist......."
513736,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-21 22:35:00,0, I wouldn't be too confident. I like your team but Price is shaky! We have more of a chance getting to the playoffs this year then you do!!
513762,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-22 01:08:00,4399," Confidence has nothing to do with what my team did last year,I am confident my team is good enough to compete for playoff spot whether they make or not thats another matter."
513973,jjcanoe,2010-10-22 19:17:00,744," As Habs fans are so fond of saying....... It doesn't matter how you did if you didn't win the cup  if they didn't win it last year who cares what round they lost in, the ONLY difference between the Leafs and the habs season last year is a few that the habs got a few extra home games to generate revenue  Congrats!!"
513980,jediangler,2010-10-22 19:25:00,1923,Habs also didn't have to give their 1st and 2nd round picks to the Bruins last year.
514131,jediangler,2010-10-23 02:17:00,1923,"Actually, because Boston had Toronto's first pick they traded their own first pick to Florida with Wideman for Horton & Campbell. Wideman=Campbell so...  Kessel<Horton, Seguin, Knight & lottery pick next summer."
514133,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-23 02:28:00,0,"[quote name='Sinclair' date='22 October 2010 - 03:31 PM' timestamp='1287775861' post='513982' Kessel > Seguin.   This year, I'm sure he will be."
514193,JohnF,2010-10-23 13:45:00,3494," I think that was a matter of Burke choosing to do it, not having to. How many years before Boston can say whether or not they came out ahead (with reason)? Toronto can honestly say they have a very good producer already producing. Unless Boston's picks turn out to be head and shoulders better than Kessel it will be years before they can claim hey won the trade. It will all depend on each players longevity. In any case, what are the chances that the draft picks will still be with Boston when Kessel is gone from hockey.  The long and short of it is that Toronto has got what they need now. Maybe Boston's plans allow for a few years of development. That's nice for them.  JF"
512944,solopaddler,2010-10-19 02:40:00,8605, They played with intensity. Was proud of their comeback late in the 3rd.  5 game point streak still intact.
512946,ctdd2006,2010-10-19 02:44:00,531, Fun team to watch!  Lots of heart!
512957,ADB,2010-10-19 03:26:00,444," Ridiculous.  How many games did Avery play in during the 2002/2003 season when Detroit won the cup?  Answer: 36. How many games did Avery play during the playoffs that year?  Answer: 0.  Just because a player has ""won"" a Stanley Cup it doesn't mean they're a successful player...I shouldn't have to tell you that.  By that measure, players like Peter Statsny and Marcel Dionne were pretty average.  Not to mention Ray Bourque, who if he didn't luckily sneak onto the Avalance's Stanley Cup team, would've gone cupless as well.  As for your draft picks...how many goals have they scored for you lately? As for Tuuka Rask...I doubt he's even played 50 games in the NHL as of yet.  When he does something of note, let me know."
513008,JohnF,2010-10-19 13:46:00,3494,"I'm not disappointed they lost. As several have already said they even lost their first game well, by getting a point. They showed more comeback heart than we've seen in a long time too.  But it was inevitable that they'd lose eventually. Any kind of streak always ends up being a monkey on the streaker's back. The longer the Leafs went undefeated the more media and fan pressure there would be to extend it and that just isn't usually reasonable except in a cup run. No team has ever gone a season undefeated, have they? Now our Leafs can settle down to just playing for as many wins as possible without any unreasonable expectation to win 'em all.  The final neat thing is that it takes away one more thing for the naysayers to take cheap shots at. Now the Leafs are just another team with a win/loss record. As far as I'm concerned they've got the makings for a decent run. I don't think anyone should expect a Cup final out of them but I suppose it's not beyond the realm of possibility. I'll be satisfied with a consistent season with a positive win/loss record and a little adventure into the cup run, a round or two would be nice. More than that would be wonderfully unexpected and a great precursor of what next season might bring.  As for the power play, it looks to me like #3 is trying to hard to involve the other guys and not shooting enuf himself. I like the way he goes to the net but some more shots from the line wouldn't be bad either. it's like he's too aware that he has some accomplished scorers up front and is trying to feed them, or mebbe he's taking the C too seriously. Regardless, the fact remains that we're 4 & 1 for the season and we're getting goal production from some surprise people. Even the much maligned Kaberle is producing from the line, both rushing and shooting.  I wonder is Gunnerson's job is in jeopardy. He sure hasn't lived up to last year's preview and the leaf are definitely deep at the Dee end.  Okay, that's end of my Leaf babbling for now. I couldn't stay out forever.  Way to go, Leafs.  JF"

513020,ctranter,2010-10-19 14:49:00,543," Scott Stevens is one of the most solid defensive defencemen to play the game, and one of the best hitters of all time.  Do you really think that one hit ended Lindros's career?  How about the other 5 times he got serious concussions?  Lindros was soft, he had his head down, and got punished for it."

Regarding Kessel, thanks for the one of the best finishers the leafs have had in a long time.  He gave us a point last night, and will give us many points to come.  Rask is unproven, give him a few seasons before you attempt this misguided trash talk.  Toronto will have the last laugh, and Burke will continue to look like a genius.  Keep that trash talk coming, whatever helps you sleep at night.  GO LEAFS GO"

Don't believe me, hop on youtube.  Avery is a pest, and I probably hate him as much as you guys, but he doesn't have the size to HURT most guys... He just gets inside their heads."

513099,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-19 19:34:00,2690," Agreed, Scott was one of the hardest hitters the game has ever seen.  As well as an extremely talented defenceman.  Would have loved to see him suiting up with the Leafs!"

513211,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-20 00:36:00,0," I knew people would come to Scott Stevens defense but the truth of the mater is, he tried to hurt players. His mouth must have been watering when he seen people with their head down. Those are cheap shots. You can hit them but not try to injure them.  Watched the game last night and there was some things lacking. For one? Checking. Our checking line was almost invisible. Orr hasn't been the same after the knockout. I think we outplayed them for the most part, but still looked worn down.  The two goals called back were good calls. The last penalty that led to the game winner? Crappy.  I say give Versteeg another two weeks and if he doesn't rack up points? Demote him to second line. Bring up Kumelin, Macarthur, or Sjostrom(all of which can put the puck in the net). We'll still have two solid lines."
513283,lookinforwalleye,2010-10-20 03:20:00,4399," Sjostrom,LOL the only net he could put the puck in is a soccer net!! He hasn`t scored more than 10 goals in a season but hey he might be good enough to play on your first line,good luck with that!!"
513296,solopaddler,2010-10-20 09:35:00,8605, I was thinking the same thing LOL!  He's great on the PK though. I think we're 3rd best in the league at the moment.

513384,Aaron Shirley,2010-10-20 18:01:00,655,"One thing is for sure, I am finally going to enjoy watching Leafs games a little more this year if they keep up this effort. The investment I made in a 52"" HD TV and Leafs TV may not seem like such a waste of money this year  I don't think the buds will stay at the top of the Eastern conference for long, and they will more than likely be fighting for a playoff spot by the end of the season... but they will be a lot more fun to watch this year. It's been way too long since TO has had a decent team, and if they do make the playoffs, they could be a sleeper with the heart they are capable of playing with. I will not be jumping on the parade bandwagon though  Avery just needs a really good thumping."
513385,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-20 18:04:00,2690, AMEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
513441,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-20 21:50:00,0," Ya I know. But he is big, aggressive and fast and can cause turnovers. I'm trying to recall a player on the first line with the same traits and the line was successful. Its always not about scoring. But I will concur. He is the last pic of the three.  Verbeek on a second line will give us two great lines. I'm only suggesting Verbeek be demoted if his play does not improve major within the next two weeks.  Getting ready to watch the game. If the trend continues? The leafs will lose tonight. Since it seams most teams that play a team back to back, win one and lose one. Though trends are meant to be broken!"
512228,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-16 02:08:00,0,"What a game!!! I think the Rangers outplayed the leafs for the first minute of the game and after that, it was ALL leafs!!! I was thinking win or lose, this team has alot of potential. The only reason the game was close is because Guigere let in TWO weak goals. The second goal I have to blame Phaneuf!!!This is the only player I have a problem with!!He HAS to play the body more! No wonder he had such a horrible plus minus with the flames! Offensively he rocks so he is a diamond in the rough!  Man, after that goal the leafs were flying on all cylinders. If it wasn't for Henrik Lundqvist, the score would have been 30-3!!! Something about Sweden but they produce some awesome goaltenders!  I was telling my friend that if the leafs could kill the penalty, they will soon take the lead, and sure enough? We killed it and took the lead! Hats off to Armstrong for walking away from that fight. Avery was trying to change the momentum of the game!  Then they called that crappy penalty on Orr. Orr wasn't himself this game. He needs to pick himself back up and start hitting.  I also called the Kessel goal! He had 5 out of 3 glorious scoring chances and capitalized on 2! I'm like Kessel will score the game winner! Kessel is the man!!!  I dont know whats going on or if Wilson is to credit, but our Power play and Penalty killing is AWESOME!!!  I dont want them to trade anyone! Well maybe we can pick up Richards! If anyone should watch his back, it is Phaneuf! He has to work on his defense. Phaneuf for Richards? NO PROBLEM!!!!  But we did play with 5 defencemen so maybe we MIGHT need another defenceman?  Stars of the Game? Bozazk, Lundqvist, Kessel and I want to see Schenn with more ice time!!!  We may keep Kaberle after all!!!"
512229,Nipfisher,2010-10-16 02:13:00,2449,I thought Schenn played terrible. He is brutal. Everytime he touched the puck I closed my eyes and held my breath. Kaberle had some sweet moves on that late rush.
512232,Kinger,2010-10-16 02:17:00,351,And just think if you can add Brad Richards to that mix.... Great start and really fun to watch!

512242,solopaddler,2010-10-16 02:38:00,8605,"Was a fun game to watch, 4-0 is pretty sweet.  Avery doesn't belong in the league. Don't know how he continually gets away with this crap."
512243,irishfield,2010-10-16 02:42:00,26272,After the double slash crap.. back of knee and ankle he should be suspended for intent to injure!
512245,ctdd2006,2010-10-16 02:52:00,531,  I agree! The guy is a bum!   Let's find a way to extend Kaberle and bring Richards to town!  This team is fun to watch!  I'm on the fence with Phaneuf but I think I'd rather have him than not.  What about the McCarthur and Armstrong pickups?  It's obvious Burke/Wilson may lack in the personality department with the press and on TV but they are on to something in Leaf Town!!! Go Leafs!!!!
512256,Tdel,2010-10-16 04:08:00,393,"The leafs do have something going here at the start of the season. There were a few times late in the game tonight when they were showing what did them in last year....  They had some great passes while having a man advantage on Avery's penalty but no shots on net. You can't score if you don't shoot, simple as that.  It gave the Rangers time to re-group, tie the game and the leafs were running around in the mean time trying to keep up.  If this is a trend, you will see the leafs take the usual slide. Passing looks great but goals look better.  I certainly would not blame Toronto's goalie. The shot he stopped with his right pad saved the game for the leafs.  I am looking forward to a great Leaf team this year. It is about time. Kind of early in the season to predict how good they will be though so lets wait until the new year.   Tom.  Canadiens fan all the way good or bad."
512301,tb4me,2010-10-16 16:10:00,3295,"Sean Avery is a hack and a bum..Yet extremely effective for his team..When he took that bad penalty the commentators said.""why do they continue to play this guy"" well now we know why"

512427,SlowPoke,2010-10-17 02:03:00,2984,"This team may be playing a little over their heads but I think the major difference between this team and the last few years is, there's no train-wreck type players. You don't need a team of super stars when everyone is playing competently."
512465,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-17 11:31:00,0," Unfortunately guys like that thrive in the NHL. There are a lot of them. And even worse...they help win stanley cups.....  I thought their power play was amazing. There was so many good scoring chances they had. They may have misplayed that 5 on 3(no traffic in front of the net to screen or pick up rebounds) but over all it has potential. In one power play they had well over 10 shots and that was in only the first minute of the powerplay.  This team is looking good and I think the Leafs will take the Islanders on Monday. The only thing is, which goalie do we go with?? Giguere looked shaky....I say we stay with Guigere and when he loses, we put in the monster, and keep him till he loses.  Anyone catch the Montreal/Ottawa game? I turn on the tube and its 3-1 Ottawa. 2 seconds later. 3-2 and a few minutes later 3-3. Montreal wins it 4-3.  Defense saved the game for Montreal. I really like Jacques Martin's coaching style."
512515,jjcanoe,2010-10-17 15:57:00,744,"Yeah I think Avery is just out to injure players, that seems to be his style.  wonder if the Rangers can trade him to the WWE for a RAW or Smackdown draft pick??  Avery might actually fit in there!!  jjcanoe"

Oh ya, I forgot, he's still getting paycheques from the Leafs and he's retired. The Leafs are paying him $1million this year and $1 million a year for another 3yrs after that. That's a pension plan that even the teachers can't touch. If Avery was a Leaf the story would be different."
512713,solopaddler,2010-10-18 11:55:00,8605," That's a completely ridiculous comparison.  Sure Tucker was an agitator but Avery is in a class by himself when it comes to being universally despised.  Avery, many many times has attempted to injure an opposing player.  I can't think of one similar example with Tucker.  Tucker had respect, Avery doesn't.  The ONLY comparison I can make to Avery is Ken Linsemen back in the day and even that's a stretch.  You've got to be a Sen's fan. That's the only explanation for a post like that."
512715,jediangler,2010-10-18 12:02:00,1923,"Avery & Linseman. Good comparison, they both have stanley cup rings. Linseman even scored the stanley cup winning goal.
