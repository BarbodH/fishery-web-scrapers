512823,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-18 19:26:00,2690,That is really sweet!!
512833,misfish,2010-10-18 19:53:00,29133,Did ya phone for pricing?  Thats pretty cool.
512849,blaque,2010-10-18 20:42:00,2419,"I did not ""phone for pricing"" lol  That usually means ""we need to get you into a conversation first and give you our sales pitch before we break the cost to you"""
512861,splashhopper,2010-10-18 22:09:00,2931,I just called them.  And for a mere $2295.00 + shipping from Kelowna BC... you too can have one.  I am really gonna have to think about this.  U see the boat only cost 395! What would my wife think?
512896,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-18 23:43:00,2690,   It is a really slick set up though!!
513001,blaque,2010-10-19 13:19:00,2419,"Heck..........you can pay that and more for just a cap on your truck bed. This is much more pragmatic and think of the money you'll save at the chiropractor! It pays for itself. These are all lines to use on the wife, christmas is coming!"
513174,splashhopper,2010-10-19 23:21:00,2931," Yeah I could see it now:  Me: "" honey, check out OUR Christmas present that I got for us""  Her: "" Ahhh that's soooo perfect for Christmas""  Me: I KNEW you would like it too  Her:  OFC'ers to fill in the blank next ....."
513180,irishfield,2010-10-19 23:42:00,26272,Damn... and I'm only charging $1200 for my airplane canoe loader.. time to take another look at that!!!
513183,blaque,2010-10-19 23:48:00,2419, Go ahead and double up on that irish
513563,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-21 04:48:00,2582,"As soon as I saw the video I thought...""I bet it would be cheaper for the person to just buy a trailer for there tinny""...and I was correct.  Could not imagine who would spend the money for that over a trailer."
513564,ctdd2006,2010-10-21 05:21:00,531," there are advantages there...and places you don't want to take a trailer!  I know of many instances where we've left the perfectly good shore laner trailer behind to throw the 14ft tinney in the box of a truck so we didn't have to haul a trailer...that being said, I still wouldn't pay that kind of money for that...but I'm still young???"
513601,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-21 15:09:00,2582,I agree there are places you don't want to trailer. But as you mentioned just throw the boat in your pickup. Then I guess storage could become an issue.  Bottom line I guess is that I'm just to cheap to spend money on a set up like that
513657,fish-miester,2010-10-21 18:21:00,864,thats actually pretty kool!
