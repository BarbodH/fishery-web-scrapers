513636,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-21 17:00:00,0,"Well, it's time to hop in the boat and start searching for the hyyyyuge fall walleyes. Today we are heading up the Rainy River in search of a few new spots we have mapped out, should be alot of fun!  It's 0 degrees outside with a steady 15kmh wind from the west. Last few days we've had lots of rain and bad weather, so I figure today is gonna be a perfect day.  Plan is to jig some minnows at the start, find the bites, then throw/troll some Rapala DT 10's.  I'll be back this evening with some pics and a report  Wish us luck, today is the first day in the search of the 15lb walleye"
513653,Rod Caster,2010-10-21 18:13:00,5784,Good luck! I'm looking forward to seeing what you get.

513681,Terry,2010-10-21 19:56:00,14456,good luck  love big waleye
513700,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-21 20:58:00,0,"just got back from round one, and the mommas are biting! I lost the biggest eye I've ever seen in person, lol, right at the fackin boat two. It was an easy 15lbs, if not a lil' more.  So, we came in for a bite to eat, then out we go again to see if we can find that lunker.  also caught 5-6 around 27-29"", not monsters, but beautiful fish"
513702,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-21 21:01:00,0,"Also, if any locals decide they want to go out, dont use a small boat, and wear your life jackets! 6ft waves, not fun in a 17ft with a 20 horse johnson"
513732,mercman,2010-10-21 22:27:00,7054,  cant wait to see the pics. Ive never see a walleye bigger tha 10lbs. also i was gonna say something about the above post but i've matured a bit in the last few months

513868,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-22 13:48:00,0,"this is what a 15lb walleye on your line looks like! (hahaha, a true tease) "
513869,Rod Caster,2010-10-22 13:48:00,5784,"If that's the small one....let me guess, there's actually a worm harness at the end of that anchor rope?"
513872,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-22 13:49:00,0,"quick tip, salted tubes rigged on jig heads"
