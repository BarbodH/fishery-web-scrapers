513983,irishfield,2010-10-22 19:31:00,26272,"Caught a paid, contracted, documentary researcher/videographer that had taken one of my videos from last September, that Lloyd had shot when with me, and the guy had re-uploaded it claiming it as his own work. The complete 10 minutes and 52 seconds with no editing, other than the airplane noise taken out and some annoying ""porn"" music in the background. He was also in process of using parts of my nice clear 1080 HD video from this summer for his documentary on the Temagami area, that is supposed to air on CHEX TV and CKWS TV Kingston.  Now if he had of asked first.. instead of just going ahead and stealing it.. I probably would have been flattered, but to steal it outright and infringe the copyright he can go pound salt.  He tried to convince me that he was making no money off MY portion of the videos.. but only off the advertisments that would result because of the documentary on TV. Now if I get that correct.. he's making money of his compulation that includes my video.. but it's not money he's making because of my aerial footage. Ya.. okay! lol"
513985,TC1OZ,2010-10-22 19:36:00,987,Good luck!  I hope what hes making off it is worth what your going to have to spend to get it!
513986,Roy,2010-10-22 19:36:00,13728,I think Lloyd should get 50%
513987,edmichit,2010-10-22 19:37:00,145,"Unfortunately very few laws out there related to social media, to protect you or them. I've seen your 1080 stuff, and it's excellent stuff that others can use for free. I suggest you ""watermark"" it when publishing to protect it...that way at least they will contact you for original material.....then you can control and decide. I hope it doesnt discourage you from continuing to produce it...we all sure enjoy it! thanks  "
513988,Beats,2010-10-22 19:37:00,543,Wow..  How did you stumble across his video?
513990,irishfield,2010-10-22 19:49:00,26272, Say what... I'm not after anything. But I will be keeping an eye on those stations documentary schedules... lol
513991,irishfield,2010-10-22 19:50:00,26272,"  He was nice enough to subscribe to my ""channel"" last night...."
514000,Terry,2010-10-22 20:11:00,14456,"so he subscribed so he would know when you have more videos uploaded........  he can't do that  I would tell he he does not have your permission to use and and must add to the credits... special thanks to Wanye *** of Irishfield Airport or what ever the name is, of the aerial video footage for all past present and future use  or you will take legal action and in the future must ask before using your property"
514001,irishfield,2010-10-22 20:14:00,26272,Yah.. I see another guy just subscribed! Probably his intent tooooo... lol

514052,tb4me,2010-10-22 23:54:00,3295,Yup thats not very nice at all.I wonder if you contact youtube what they would say???
514059,irishfield,2010-10-23 00:06:00,26272,They pulled down his copy of the 10:52 for copyright infringment this morning.
514073,smally21,2010-10-23 00:25:00,993,so should i be taking stills out of your videos to advertise the camp or no...?
514084,chilli,2010-10-23 00:44:00,199,First off what's your channel name so I can subscribe. Mines wildniagara.  The more subscriptions you have the more you turn up in the results and sooner or later google comes knocking and offers to pay you to put up those little ads. I posted that 407 cows video a couple weeks back and got enough views on Thanksgiving just from OFC that google came knocking and offered to ad that video to my adsense account.   Thank you OFNers for clickin.  I make more money off youtube then I ever did on niagarafishing.net.  Secondly I hope you reported this   to not only youtube but hopefully you can find out which adsense account it was making money for and have him banned from google. It is my understanding that google has no tolerance for rule breakers.  BTW what was his username. We should all be able to add some channel comments so he might get the message and others viewing his videos can see comments warning them he is taking credit for others work.  Dan
