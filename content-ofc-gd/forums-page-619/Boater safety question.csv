513290,Kwan,2010-10-20 05:29:00,132," I think the guy who said/thought that the fisherman shoulda reeled it in and turned on the motor and dive out of the way was blowing his steam off for what happened to his side of the incident.  Which is  I didn't know they could get charged with impeding with right to fish.  I woulda thought harassment, but I rather just leave those guys alone or talk to them when they're calmer or something.  If he read some of the posts from this thread he'd apologize.  Hopefully"
513298,Rich Clemens,2010-10-20 10:08:00,3131,"Unbelievable.  I know that when I am under power going through a narrow area, if there is another boat, motorized or not sitting/fishing there, I will definitely slow down as to not make a large wake.  Even wider areas, when I see a canoe, I'll slow down until we pass.  Common sense and courtesy goes a long way."
513301,Rizzo,2010-10-20 10:15:00,4754,"Thanks for all the info...it appears to be unanimous. The funny thing is, the neighbour was going on and on about how these guys don't know the rules, probably don't have an operators card etc. He was so convinced he was right almost had me doubting...thought ,maybe there was a ""no fishing in a narrow part of a lake"" clause I wasn't aware of!"
513303,spincast,2010-10-20 10:32:00,3279,"of course, just cause you're in the right doesn't mean he'll change his mind (sounds like he might have to find it before he changes it?). Might want to just hand him the Boat Safety book, open at the page discussing ROW under power vs not under power, with the section that says the vessel under power needs to steer clear highlighted?  . He'll be there next year, but likely the dolt in the boat will choose a bigger lake to tube in next year, so proving the point (especially too forcefully) might open more issues than it closes?"
513304,Rizzo,2010-10-20 10:46:00,4754," bingo...this person is regularly upset about one thing or another, just that type of personality I guess. I need to find a delicate way to explain that the fisherman had the right to be there, and it was not their responsibility to get out of the way when they saw him coming."

They have to give way to anyone fishing power or no power. There are spots where I troll that get very narrow. You should see the Yachts scream to a halt when they realize they can't get by at full steam.  
513326,xpedx789,2010-10-20 13:00:00,11,"Also, you cant have you're neighbor chasing off you're tenants like that either! I would consider telling him he owes you for 1 weeks rent! If he is really that upset, and believes so adamantly that he is right, you may need to take it a step further, and just file a report with the local law enforcement....  Just a thought..."

513445,Tybo,2010-10-20 22:07:00,1373,"I just went through the department of justice again. The rules are still the same. The ""vessel"" that has the better mobility must give way. This also goes for sail boater to boaters that are fishing.  Oh by the way. In the real rules and laws. The word the right of way never appear. Since the idea is to prevent a collision!!"
513451,glen,2010-10-20 22:24:00,2641,Fishing always has the right of way unless its a floatplane.  Rizzo nice of you to give them there money back.  They didnt ask for any trouble.
513529,Sharkbait22,2010-10-21 02:03:00,297,Thanks for the clarification. Nice to know about rivers.  
513558,POLLIWOGG,2010-10-21 04:05:00,835,"These are where someone is a little bit right and then does something a whole lot wrong.  The wake boarder is right in a vessel cannot park itself in the way as it is against the law to impede the free flow of traffic, but this would hardly be the case as there is lots of room to get by without an exchange of paint. Doesn't matter if the drifting boat is legal or not the wake boarder should have given way to the drifting boat. Sounds more like he wasn't keeping watch and the realization that he might have killed someone made him look for someone else to blame.  If you are fishing in a channel and  boats have to slow down for you, you are impeding the flow of traffic and should move on. But again he should not have been there is no excuse for running over someone.  Same thing with the float plane, Float plane on the water is a water craft subject to the same rules as a motor boat so the guy was right on that but wrong when he assumed right of way and ran into it or allowed it to run into him, as Tybo points out no vessel ever has right of way. The regs read vessels give way but never does it say assume right of way and any publication that says different is a usually a screwed up simplified version written by car guys,not boaters. There are so many exceptions to the rules that make it difficult to dictate a right of way, its better to have nobody with right of way, way is always  given never taken. The collision regs state you must always avoid a collision no matter if you are the give way vessel or the stand on vessel, you can't run into some one or not avoid them running into you.  Tybo , under the definitions none of us would be considered a vessel in the act of fishing that would require another vessel to give way to us. This is for commercial boats that are working all kinds of gear that restrict their movement .  A copy of the collision regs makes for good reading when the fish aren't biting."
513565,Tybo,2010-10-21 10:07:00,1373,Polliwogg. If you are long lining(200ft plus line out)or down rigging.Your mobility is restricted by the lines. Then you are classified as a fishing vessel.
513571,smally21,2010-10-21 11:59:00,993,"skiers and boarders and tubers seem to think no rules apply.  no way condoning anything from the original post.  not trying to start anythig with trolling guys but when you've got 150 feet of line out and you're trolling a narrow channel what is the 'other' boater supposed to do?  i guess just sit and wait for the fisherman to drive thru a 1000m channel at 1.5knots?  i suppose the act of fishing and such applies however its not like this is your livelihood or feeding your family.  at some point the fisherman needs to realize legal or not her is engaged in a recreational activity, tying up a thru way on the water and the other boater might actually have something more important going on than catching the big one.  we always talk about our right to fish and invoke the 'engaged in the act of fishing' like we're whalers on a three year voyage and how the other guy is a jerk but lets face it-  as a fisherman i have a right to fish and typically the law is on my side. but i have a responsibility not to impede traffic  as a boater constantly slowing down and yielding right of way to a fisherman drifting thru the channel, or trolling thru the narrows impedes my enjoyment of the lake we share, as well as impedes my right to travel freely on the waterways WE SHARE. i just might be actually working on the lake, or going to work on the lake, and doing something more important than fishing - but i have a responsibity to not endanger or impede others right to fish  my point just saying what some others have said - recreational fishing is just that  i guess ive spent more time dodging tin cans in my cruiser than trolling thru the narrows so i come off a little more on the boaters side."
513593,canadadude,2010-10-21 13:56:00,769,Just because a sail boat is under sail it does not have the right of way over a power boat.The on coming vessel must give way to the slower or moored vessel.I know from trolling Lake Ontario many sail boats think because they are under sail they have right of way over a power boat trolling.However after this being said it's always in your best interest to give way to avoid a collision right or wrong it's better to untangle a few lines then be run over.
513646,POLLIWOGG,2010-10-21 17:49:00,835,"Rule 3 General Definitions  The term ""vessel engaged in fishing"" means any vessel fishing with nets, lines, trawls or other fishing apparatus which restrict maneuverability, but does not include a vessel fishing with trolling lines or other fishing apparatus which do not restrict maneuverability.  They don't consider trolling lines or riggers restrictive enough to get you the ""vessel engaged in fishing"" designation.  I was wr-wr -wr- wrong about the float plane, the guy was right, a seaplane is to keep clear of all vessels but if a risk of collision exists complies with the rules the same as a boat. But he was still wrong in not avoiding a collision."

513220,Rizzo,2010-10-20 00:56:00,4754,"My cottage neighbour is very upset about something that happened this summer, just wondered if someone could give me some insight as to who is at fault. Here's the scenario: 2 guys (my renters) were fishing with the motor shut off, drifting slowly with the wind. My neighbour was out pulling a relative behind his boat on a wakeboard. Our lake is a few kms long, but in some areas only 150-200 feet across. It is long and straight, so you can see almost the entire length of the lake. The guys who were fishing drifted into one of the narrower areas of the lake, and were apparently right in the middle of it (so maybe 50 - 75 feet on either side to pass). The boat with the wakeboard came right towards them, swerved at the last second and a person in that boat fell and got hurt. We are a small inland lake, there is no marked channel. According to my neighbour they should not have been fishing there, and it was their responsibility to start their motor and get out of the way when they saw him coming. I was always under the impression that the boat without power had the right away. Does the width of the area involved, or the fact they were fishing and not simply stalled have any bearing on who is at fault?"
513227,irishfield,2010-10-20 01:00:00,26272,The guy under power is at fault without a doubt... especially if they were on his right!
513229,Whopper,2010-10-20 01:02:00,2174,Rizzo the boat under power has to give way to the boat that is not
513232,Rizzo,2010-10-20 01:09:00,4754,"He complained to me saying they were ""right in the channel""...even though we have no channel, just some spots that are narrower than others."
513233,tb4me,2010-10-20 01:11:00,3295,Lol thats almost funny. The boat under power has to yeild right of way. The fishermen were in the right.
513237,Rizzo,2010-10-20 01:19:00,4754,"Thanks guys, I always felt this to be the case, but because the guy was so angry I just let him vent rather than argue! Unfortunately a person in the powered boat got a bit hurt (stitches), that boat also received damage, and the neighbour ended up being so angry with the fisherman he made their life miserable and they ended up leaving their vacation early to avoid dealing with him. Kind of a lose lose lose (the last lose is me...I refunded party of the rent because I felt badly that they had a negative experience)."
513240,Terry,2010-10-20 01:19:00,14456,at least you didn't try fishing around his dock   lol  never mind
513242,DRIFTER_016,2010-10-20 01:20:00,10439,"Yep, the boat under power is the one that has to yield.  We used to use that law to our advantage when fishing off the mouth of the Credit in late August and early September when the dang sailboaters would set up their race course right off the mouth of the river just to screw with the fishermen. We would troll through their race course and when we hit a fish would shut off the motors and drift while we fought it. We we in my buddies 36' Hatteras. It was a pretty big marker for the twit sailboaters to go around."
513243,irishfield,2010-10-20 01:22:00,26272,"We had an ass like that on Temagami last year.. figured he was on the right and to prove the point that he had right of way over an airplane taxing on the water he drove over the right hand float of the airplane. That cost him the left side of his boat from the propellor strike...and the repair costs to a float, propellor, engine rebuild and some serious firewall forward repairs on a Cessna 185!  Thank God said ass didn't have a passenger with them... or they would be headless!"
513244,Rizzo,2010-10-20 01:28:00,4754,"yipes, that's crazy Wayne, the length people will go to make a point! I don't think this guy was trying to make a point though. The renters tell me he was looking back at the kid on the wakeboard, not watching where he was going. Story checks out if you ask me. If you were watching, you'd see those fisherman from a km away. you could just stay at that end of the lake until they drift out of the ""channel"", or slow down a bit as you pass them...not swerve at the last second and hit something along the shoreline"
513245,Whopper,2010-10-20 01:30:00,2174,"Since we are on this subject I have a question  So the lake is 150 foot wide and lets assume there are boats docked/moored on each side, shouldn't it be a no wake zone?"
513246,irishfield,2010-10-20 01:36:00,26272,"My argument when I met the OPP's 22' stanley in Suicide Narrows on Temagami head on last year. He was doing 40MPH.. I was idling in a 30 foot wide channel (15' between the markers) They ended up hanging a quick left and nosed up on the shoal (while in full reverse)... I calmly stated ""isn't this a no wake zone"" and they reluctantly stated.. ""I guess it is"".  BTW.. in a normal navigable channel or narrow body of water.. apparently the no wake thing doesn't apply. The OPP sure don't follow it on our lake and are the worst offenders with a 5' wake that rolls over my floater docks. Nor is there an enforsable(sp) speed limit on the water according to the courts."
513247,kickingfrog,2010-10-20 01:38:00,8333, So your neighbour didn't have a spotter whilst dragging a boarder?
513251,Rizzo,2010-10-20 01:47:00,4754,"he had a spotter, but according to the fisherman he was also looking back at the boarder. It was actually the spotter that fell in the boat and got hurt when the boat swerved/hit something along shoreline. There aren't any posted no wake zones on our lake. When a lake gets to a certain width is it automatically a no wake zone or does something have to be posted to be considered a no wake zone.?"
513253,Rattletrap2,2010-10-20 01:53:00,1652,"Rizzo, Without a doubt, your neighbour is in the wrong on several counts and needs to be made aware of this! I understand you not wanting to get into an argument with him, but he will never learn f you don't confront him with this.  He should have had a spotter to watch his wake boarder and he definitely had to give way to the drifting boat. Let him know it cost you money this time around with your renter, but you are not prepared to put up with this next time.  Some people are just asses!"
513255,irishfield,2010-10-20 01:55:00,26272,Becomes a real gray area.. as the legislation for doing x KPH within so many meters of shore excludes picking up or dropping off a water skier/wake boarder/tuber.

513272,Sharkbait22,2010-10-20 02:27:00,297,"I think that within 100 ft (30m) of shore you must do less than 10km.  This means that on many rivers you are not on plane.  Also the boat under power must yield.  In addition, operators must give way to fishing vessels (under reduced navigation ability), but I think this really applies to commercial fisherman with trawls etc.  Check out http://www.safeboater.com/studyguide4-7.asp"

I never realized that you could not fish in a ""channel"" but it's ok to wake board there??????  As for the sailboats, they do the same thing here blocking me and pushing me to the wall as close as possible and then some.  I get a kick out of them when they want to prove their point of right of way and take on a steam freighter.  A few have been run down because they don't understand that those things aren't going to move at a moments notice."

513286,John Bacon,2010-10-20 03:33:00,3277, I am pretty sure that I read that the 6 mph within 100' feet of shore does not apply when a lake or river is less than 200' wide.  That doesn't change the fact that its his responsibility to keep a proper lookout (Does he know why spotters are required when pulling a skier?) and to avoid a boat that is not under power.  A boater is also responsable for any damage his wake causes.

Meeting: Powerboat and Sailboat"" fisher man"" : When a sailboat ""fisher man"" under sail alone, meets a powerboat, the sailboat ""fisher man""  is the Stand-On Vessel and the powerboat is the Give-Way Vessel.
