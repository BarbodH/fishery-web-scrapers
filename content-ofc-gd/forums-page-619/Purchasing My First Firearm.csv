509969,Billy Bob,2010-10-07 12:20:00,5865,"For the hunting you said you are interested in NOW a 20 gauge will fit the bill VERY well. Shells should be no problem at all obtaining even in the bush areas of Ontario. The 20 gauge has been around for a LONG time now and has been excepted in all kind of hunting applications.  Now remember a couple of things when you're shopping for said shotgun. If used, how old is it because some models are tough animals when you want to add another barrel, like a fully rifle barrel for deer/bear hunting. Also I would recommend a 3"" chambered 20 gauge shotgun as it has more options over the older 2.75"" chamber. It's even good for waterfowl hunting with 3"" shells.  You mentioned you may be interested in a Remington 870 ""Wingmaster"". This is a fine shotgun unlike the Remington 870 ""Express"" which is what you will mostly see out there for sale. It's a cheaper version of the ""Wingmaster"" and nowhere as fine. Also there are ""Light weight"" versions of the Wingmaster that would be ideal for your upland game like the grouse you are most interested in. BUT you can NOT use any barrel for a ""LIGHT"" version.....it most also be a LIGHT barrel for this shotgun. You will find the 870 Wingmaster cost much more than the 870 Express but it a shotgun you will be proud to carry afield.  The Mossberg 500's are also a VERY fine and ECONOMICAL shotgun. Don't put up your nose to them and consider one. They have MANY MANY different models available for any kind of hunting you can imagine.  Bottom line that no one else mentioned here is you MUST shoulder the gun you intend to use and see how it fits to YOU. And don't just shoulder one...try SEVERAL and see what feels best to you and go from there.  WELCOME to HUNTING, Bob"
510066,Leecher,2010-10-07 17:56:00,7832," Dr. I have a Baikal single barrell 12g that I use for grouse and I love it.  I use #5 shot and very rarely miss a bird with it even in the thickess of brush.  My very first gun was .410 single shot that my dad bought me when I pass the gun security course at the age of 12  I use that for the longuest time until I tried the 12g.  The Baikals are very light and easy to clean and maintain.  Great gun for starters    I also like the added security with the cocking mechanism. Here's a link to the one I have  Single Barrell Shotgun  IMHO If you are only going to hunt for grouse, get a single barrel shotgun. Leechman"
510120,BUSTER,2010-10-07 19:57:00,1336,"Altho I have a single barrel 20ga on the bottom and 22 mag on top, I'd have to tell you the story of how many times I've come around a corner and seen multiple game birds in a group no way would my single barrel bagged 3 birds in seconds that my 12ga pump does... just a thought."
510271,Dara,2010-10-08 02:21:00,3052,  Grab yourself a single shot break action 410. You can get them new for under $200.00 You get great range out of a 410 and its light and easy to carry. plus its very safe for a new hunter to get used to handling a gun
510277,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-08 02:30:00,0,410's are nice guns.  i don't think i'm able to hunt turkey with one though.  taking the course in feb in hopes of going with a chum this spring.
510283,NAW,2010-10-08 02:42:00,4022,"  Before you said you wanted ""the best grouse gun possible""..  Now you'r talking about hunting turkey with the same gun.  Two totally different quarry..  If your hunting Turkey you pretty well need a 12g.  410 is out of the question.  20g is questionable.  Get an 870 pump..  Or whatever brand you prefer, so long as it's a 12g.  I only know a few people who hunt turkey with a 20g.  I would say 99.9% use a 12g.  And they work great for grouse too!"
510284,Dara,2010-10-08 02:45:00,3052,  you really gotta make up your mind...like we said...12 guage...you will want to do other stuff once you get a gun...I really like a semi
510285,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-08 02:55:00,0,"in the eyes of the law, you need a 20 to hunt turkey.  i appreciate that the 12 is a better turkey gun."
510329,Dara,2010-10-08 13:28:00,3052,"  You may know fishing, but you're new at hunting. Pay attention to what people are saying...12 guage lad...12 guage..its the better everything gun"
510331,anders,2010-10-08 13:40:00,1168,i agree buddy...if you are looking for an upland game gun and a turkey gun...its a no brainer IMHO a 12 gauge all the way. You will buy the 20 gauge and shortly thereafter you will be purchasing the 12.  Or you can just buy a .22 with a 10 shot clip for grouse and leave those poor turkeys alone
510364,TJQ,2010-10-08 15:30:00,7806,"12 gauge for grouse... LOL.. i bug my buddies about it all the time, such a big gun for such a frail bird. save yourself alot of dough, and go get yourself a nice, light single shot .410, use 3 inch shells, #4 or 5 shot. No need for artillery, when your hunting something you can kill with a rock.... just my humble opinion...  If its turkey your after, well then ya better get the 12.  Jaden does just fine with a single shot .22.  "

513820,cjgraham,2010-10-22 06:27:00,104,I live in the Sault also. If your only purpose is  grouse then get a 12 ga.  Don't worry about recoil or too much gun. If you get small game load you will barley feel a thing. There are a few options out there and it depends what you like to do. I own a few shottys but my best purchase was a single shot 12 ga for 80 bucks that only weighs 5 pounds. When I head up north to fish the rivers it goes over my shoulder and I can't tell you how many birds I've shot with it.
513822,bushart,2010-10-22 09:58:00,2628,I've shot enough partridge with a 12 ga to fill all the matresses in your house with feathers.  like all hunting---practice your shooting  More versatility---usually cheaper ammo  Price 410 and 12
513853,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-22 13:29:00,0, this is the school of thought i grew up in.
513877,bigbuck,2010-10-22 13:58:00,2449,"It's a lot different now that you want to hunt turkey, get yourself a decent 3"" 12ga pump action and for grouse, either a 410 or a 20ga. You will need 2 guns. A 12ga for grouse will end up making a mess of them. Guns are like fishing rods, there is a different one for each application. My dad always harped on me about how many golf clubs I had, I told him you need 14 to play and a few different ones to switch in/out of the bag for different courses and techniques, he never did understand that..."
513882,troutologist,2010-10-22 14:08:00,951,"Knowing what you want to use it for get a 20ga. double or pump...you will appreciate the lighter gun for hiking etc. When wing and I walked into smash and back you could see the both of us juggling the 12s every minute or 2 on the way back, they get heavy after about 10kms of walking...especially if you're carrying other gear eg fishing rods, camping gear.  If you want to hunt turkey once or twice the old man has a side by side 12 and a bunch of turkey loads at home you can borrow.   Everyone expouts versatility in a gun, but a versitile gun means it does everything decently, not a specific job well, which hiking long trails for grouse an 8lb+ 12ga. doesn't in my opinion."
513891,canadadude,2010-10-22 14:52:00,769,"for grouse my pick is a 20g side X side, or better an over/under my favorite was a gun my buddy had, a 410g/22cal over and under.I saw mentioned a 20g/410cal over and under another sweet grouse gun.I've hunted with guys who take grouse with sling shots while deer or moose hunting, a 12g is alittle over powering but is good provided your using light loads."
513900,highdrifter,2010-10-22 15:22:00,2534,"I'd say go with the 20g dude.  I've got a 20g mossberg pump for upland burds and it's one of my faves..  For grouse I wouldn't use shells over 2 3/4in..  for ducks, 3in shells outta do the job.  Look for an adjustable choke on the barrel too..  and never mix your shells!!  I once dislocated my shoulder with a slug on full choke LOL  cheers"
513906,Cookslav,2010-10-22 15:39:00,1457,"Like it has been said ""IF"" all you ever intend to shoot is Grouse, or rabbit then a 20 will suit you fine. But If you have ""ANY"" question about up sizing your game there is no room for doubt IMO...get the 870 combo Its versitile, and can accomodate almost any application. Or grab a 20, and then if you change your mind pick up a 12 later.  Like fishing rods each peice has its own specific uses that may lend themselves better to certain applications. For exsample, We use a 20 for birds(or a .22), a 12 for thick bush and drives when looking for Deer And usually take along a 30-06 for sitting on ridges for those longer open shots from a stand. But IMO If your going to only buy ONE....the 870 supermag combo is the only one to hit all your points.  Ps. If it's just Grouse your after and money is a concern why not a .22 ??? Its what I used to use. Just saying"
509646,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-06 03:11:00,0,"After years of deliberations I'm going to purchase my first firearm.  With a lot of options (and even more opinions from people) selecting the ideal long gun is proving to be an exciting but overwhelming task.  At present, I don't plan on hunting a lot.  I don't intend on much big game hunting, in fact, I'm thinking my primary target will be upland game birds, mostly grouse.  I've been leaning towards a 20 gauge pump... either a browning bps or a remington 870 wingmaster.  I've had a lot of chums who hunt immediately tell me I should be getting a 12 for their ""versatility"", but I just think it's a bit heavy a firearm for grouse. I'm not really that concerned with the recoil but knowing a full size 20 gauge will have less recoil doesn't hurt.  If I get into hunting further, i'd love to own a 12 gauge over under one day, but at the time, it's a wee bit pricy to old a big ol girl like that.  Given the obvious wealth of hunting knowledge I can access via this site, I figured I'd ask the firearm owners what they think.  I'm interested in as much as you'll recommend... chamber, gauge, barrel length, shell preferences... whatever!  Help me pick the right firearm."
509648,bigugli,2010-10-06 03:21:00,6138,  You need a blunderbussen fer der shooten de turkey
509651,dave524,2010-10-06 03:33:00,4508,"If you plan on hunting nothing but grouse get the 20 and use lead, if there is any chance you may want to hunt waterfowl and that includes woodcock, get a 12 because of the steel shot regulations. Most of my hunting years were before the steel shot requirements for migratory birds, licenced first in 65, and the twenty was a more versatile gun then with lead, but now, you need the extra volume of the 12's bore for the less effective lead substitutes.  also: can't go wrong with a Remington 870, with a 26 inch barrel and an assortment of screw in choke tubes, in what ever gauge you choose."
509655,Sinker,2010-10-06 03:47:00,8692,"I'd look for an 870 supermag combo. You can hunt pretty much anything with the 12ga., not so much with the 20ga. Trust me, if you start into hunting, you'll really want the 12ga. You can hunt everything from grouse to moose with a shotgun, no problem.   S."
509657,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-06 03:49:00,0,You can also load slugs into a 20 gauge no?
509658,chessy,2010-10-06 03:55:00,610,stay far far far away from the new 870  they are going on there past preformance  there are many types of shotguns out there  browning  winchester mossberg. i have owned alot of guns in the past .. and none not even my old winchester model 12  which was one of the best pumps ever made . mossberg has a good warrenttee program if neede.. i now own 3 pump shotguns  and need to purchase another one for my youngest son . there 20 guage combo is great it comes with rifled slug barrel  and even drilled and tapped for a scope
509659,dave524,2010-10-06 03:58:00,4508," Yes , but they are smaller of course, and the effectiveness, assortment and technology of them is way behind the 12. If you plan on big game get the 870 multi barrel combo with a dedicated slug barrel. My choice would be the one with a cantilevered scope mount over the receiver.  edit : on the subject of recoil, many 20 pumps are built on the same receiver as the 12 the only weight saving is in the barrel and not as much as you think. A 12 with 1 oz 7 1/2 size shot trap loads ( an excellent choice for grouse ) may actually have less felt recoil then a 20."
509664,niagarasteelheader,2010-10-06 05:39:00,12,
509676,dave524,2010-10-06 12:11:00,4508," Sorry I stand corrected, my slug gun knowledge dates from the very first controlled hunter numbers hunt in Niagara in the late 70's, when virtually everyone that went out just used the old Foster style or Brenneke slugs in the favourite smoothbore cause that was basically all there was except for an iron sighted smoothbore barrel option on some guns though till the late 90's, when the 12 gauge slug gun had been perfected with developments like sabotted slugs, rifled bores or choke tubes and various scope mounting systems. A little research shows that this technology has now been applied to the 20 and it has definitely come of age as well as a slug gun in the last 10 years.  While most of the guys I hunted with used hi tech slug guns, I most often carried an also legal black powder rifle having shot deer with them previous to the start of the gun deer hunts in Niagara."
509677,kickingfrog,2010-10-06 12:20:00,8333,"For your stated purpose the 20 is perfect. If you decide to broaden your species later you'll want a second gun anyway and then the 12, or a rifle maybe, would be a logical choice depending on what you're going after.  BTW I am bias towards a 20 because that is all that my dad ever used for grouse, and we all know our dads are infallible."
509680,NAW,2010-10-06 12:28:00,4022,"I would have to aggree with the previously mentioned 870 combo.  If you'r only going to get one gun, the combo gun with 3 barrels covers almost every situation I can think of..  I just bought one, with a scope, all in (taxes included) for $780 brand new from Lebaron."
509737,craigdritchie,2010-10-06 17:05:00,1586,"If your hunting will be restricted to firing lead shot at grouse and rabbits, then a 20-gauge will work just fine. If that's the case, then you might want to think about buying a used double gun instead of a new pump. After a couple of hours out in the field (as opposed to 10 minutes standing in a store) the difference in weight and handling between 12-gauge and 20-gauge pumps is minimal.  If you think you will ever want to shoot at anything else (ducks, geese, woodcock, deer or bear) then you'll find a 12-gauge just works better. Steel shot (required for migratory birds) is definitely 12-gauge territory, for a whole bunch of reasons including vastly superior shot ballistics.  While others have stated that you can use a 20-gauge for deer, I think some of these guys might be too modest to note that this normally requires a certain amount of skill and experience. A new shooter will generally have more success with a 12.  Beyond that, you can find 12-gauge ammo everywhere - even the most remote gas stations way out in the boonies usually have a few boxes. Not so for 20-gauge. Specific loads can be tough to find, even here in southern Ontario where you can buy just about anything.  If I was restricted to owning one gun, it would be a Remington 870 pump in 12-gauge, with a 26-inch barrel and screw-in choke tubes. It's tough to beat."
509745,smally21,2010-10-06 17:26:00,993,"the 12 guage is readily availabe, suitable for every task you could imagine.  the 870 is readily available, suitable for every task you could imagine.  a buddy just bought a wingmaster for 275 using it for skeet and trap.  i guess im just agreeing with everybody, an 870 is bulletproof, easy to find used, and just as easy to sell if you choose to upgrade/change needs (but you never will)  good luck."
509753,Carp,2010-10-06 17:35:00,1488,"I've had a Remington 870 - 12 gauge for about 13 years and it works great. No issues. The price is right and you can use it for multiple species by simply changing your ammo and/or choke tubes I keep it clean and treated with proper lubricants and it's always reliable.  The Mossbergs look like a good deal as well, but I have no experience with them."
509769,jedimaster,2010-10-06 18:16:00,3472,"I have had a bunch of Shotty's from semi's to Side by Sides to all flavours of pumps, Rem, Winch, SUper Nova, MOssberg. By far the best gun I have ever had is the Winchester 1300 Speed Pump. When I was out shooting clays with a guy that just bought his first gun(SuperNova), I said here give my ol' Speed Pump a wing. With 2 shots his jaw dropped at how fast and smooth it cycles.Its light, sturdy, you can get all the goodies for it you want, and fires rounds down range faster than any othe shotgun around. Like the others I would agree with a 26"" barrel With screw in chokes, in a 3 or 3 1/2 inch setup. Then you can add on a Rifled barrel and this setup will do you for everything from Moose down to Partridge. I have a 24"" rifled barrel with cantelever scope I use that for big game, and the 26"" barrel for Turkey, Upland, rabbit, Duck and Goose. a small pocket full of chokes and your good to go. You can't really go wrong with an 870, they are solid, sturdy and reliable. Mine turned into a door stop though once I shot my Winchester though."
509775,wallyboss,2010-10-06 18:50:00,1095,If you are going to use that gun only mostly for grouse find yourself a good .410.  That's all I've ever used for them.

As far as I can tell, the sabot slugs are just as deadly for deer from a 20 as a 12 (and still kicks like a mule!)  20 GA is a great gun for grouse etc, but if you are planning on going for waterfowl, a 12 is your best bet..  My 2 cents.."
509826,Dara,2010-10-06 22:58:00,3052,"You live in the Sault, get a 12 guage.  I have a few guns and a 12 does everything.  I got my son a single barrel 410 a couple years ago and its great for grouse but for a 1 gun guy you want a 12 to start with. You will be hunting ducks in no time. To learn on you want a pump."
509830,cranks bait,2010-10-06 23:14:00,721,"I use a BPS myself and love it.  Especially the bottom eject.  My girlfriend got into hunting this year and I debated on a 20 g for her.  Ended up getting her a Beretta semi.  Mainly for the weight and easyness to use.  I got the 12 g for her so that we wouldn't have to worry about getting shells mixed up while in the blind hunting together.  We both skeet shoot, waterfowl and deer.  I don't bother with the second barrel.  I just use rifled slugs.  The cost of 12 g ammo is also less than that of the 20, so I believe but I could be wrong?  I just have to make sure I am on the left of her when she shoots so I don't get shells ejected into my head...."
509832,ch312,2010-10-06 23:15:00,1590," what he said   once you start hunting you'll want to start targeting other critters where a 12 gauge will be much better suited for the job. waterfowl, turkey, jack rabbit, coyote, deer, etc are what you'd need a 12 gauge for as the 12 holds many more pellets. when slug hunting either gauge would do just fine.  make sure you pattern your gun with a few chokes and different shells to get the best patterns. we could have the same gun, but one may like brand A while the other throws better patterns with brand C."

509915,ch312,2010-10-07 03:05:00,1590," right then   although you could still buy a 12 gauge and start reloading your own shells. im guessing a light load going fast would be good for grouse making it like a 20 gauge with higher speed and likely better patterns. i've been meaning to start reloading...  how about a remington 870 in 20 gauge? im not sure about the new ones, but mine in 12 gauge is about 5-6 years old and has had zero problems after some nasty abuse.  a pump is the most reliable and can be as fast as a semi with practice. it will also shoot the lightest to heaviest loads without a hitch. a semi may be better if you dont have time to practice and have no experience with pumps. hopefully you will find a gun that will shoot everything you feed her as some semi's wont cycle really light loads.  a savage model 24 .22lr over .410 would also make a classy grouse gun. rifle up top for when you're stalking birds and popping them on the ground. then you have a .410 for when you miss with the .22"
509941,blarg,2010-10-07 04:46:00,289,"I bought a Browning BPS in 20ga last year.  So far i have shot maybe 400-500 rnds through it with zero problems, and this is mostly using the cheapest shells you can buy.  The others are right that a 12ga is more versatile but if upland birds will be your likely focus you can't go wrong with a 20.  The bps is also one of the few 20 ga shotguns you can find that is built on a smaller frame purpose built for a a 20ga while the 870 for example is a 12ga frame even in 20ga, so the bps is a bit better handling imo.  I can't say what the prices are like now but last year I bought from Lebarons, I bought the membership and saved quite a bit over the other major retailers."
