Two men jumped overboard and no one was injured.  INNISFIL — A 36-foot boat burned for two hours on Lake Simcoe before it finally sank, Tuesday evening.  Two men safely waded to shore after jumping overboard.  South Simcoe police were called to Lefroy Harbour Resort around 5 p.m.  Police say the operator and a passenger tried to beach the 36-foot Trojan when flames started shooting out of the cabin.

Both men were treated for minor hypothermia, but did not require hospitalization. Marine units from the South Simcoe and York Regional police departments also arrived on scene to find the fiery boat with no one on board. Officers tried unsuccessfully to douse the flames using a fire hose onboard York Region's 34-foot Waawaatessi police boat.

""The cause of the fire appears to be careless smoking,"" said Staff Sgt. Steve Wilson with the South Simcoe police marine unit.  Charges aren't anticipated, he added.   The 36-foot fibreglass Trojan burned for two hours before finally sinking in 32 feet of water north of Keswick, Tuesday evening. Two men safely waded to shore after jumping overboard to escape the flames.  South Simcoe police Staff Sgt. Lisa Hunt said the boat's owner is a resident of Terra Cotta, located north of Brampton, while his passenger was from Innisfil.  A salvage company will have to be hired to remove the burned boat from Lake Simcoe, if it's raised at all.  ""It is not a hazard in any way,"" Wilson said of the potential marine obstacle.  The 34-year-old boat, valued at more than $80,000, also doesn't appear to be causing any negative environmental effects.  ""Our officers went out the following day during daylight hours and there are not any fluids leaking from the boat,"" Wilson said. ""We need to make sure there is no oil or left left on the boat that could create an environmental risk.  ""Since we are satisfied that the boat is not a navigational hazard or environmental risk, the choice to remove it or not is up to the owner's insurance company,"" he added.  South Simcoe police were called to Lefroy Harbour Resort around 5 p.m., Tuesday. Police say the two men tried to beach the vessel when flames started shooting from the cabin before jumping into the water wearing life-jackets.  Paramedics treated both men for minor hypothermia, but they did not require hospitalization.  Innisfil Deputy Fire Chief Jim Ferry said firefighters simply couldn't reach the burning boat.  ""It was well out from shore and we have no means, as a fire department, to reach a fire that far out,"" said Ferry, adding the Innisfil fire department has an ice-water rescue vessel, but nothing that could have fought this blaze effectively.  Marine units from the South Simcoe and York Regional police departments also arrived to find the fiery, unmanned boat. Officers tried unsuccessfully to douse the flames using a fire hose on board York Region's 34-foot Waawaatessi police boat.  The boat, engulfed in flames, floated across Cook's Bay towards Roaches Point before finally sinking around 7 p.m"
