Once the introduction was made, found myself part of a great community / family  There's a lot of generous members on this site that share their expertise to help out other members..... no matter what type of question (NF, fishing or hunting) there's always someone that will answer  The diversity of reports being posted is phenomenal compared to other sites     participation is very high and fun to watch  All in all, in it's simplicity, this site is a real gem for all the fisher people out there   and that is the reason I stick around  Leechman"
514170,Lake Ranger,2010-10-23 10:54:00,70,"I rarely post here, but I joined last year because I was looking for sound advice on a political/environmental issue surrounding a small lake that I was trying to protect. After reading many threads I realized there was alot of intelligent and well-informed members with big opinions. I figured I'd dive in and see what advice I could generate for my battle. Turns out I was able to compile enough sound and un-biased arguements to use in my presentation to City Council which had a huge impact on the members, and measures were taken to implement a plan to protect the lake from potential abuse. With the replies to my post, I also discovered there were alot of very humorous, silly, fun, sarcastic and some even downright rude members frequenting this site. I thought I could take advantage of that aspect as well and threw another post looking for a comedian who knows about fishing and might have an interest in writing the jokes for a series of fishing cartoons I wanted to produce. It will be one year ago on October 26 that Harrison replied to my post and I laughed so hard at what he wrote that I figured it was all worth a shot. Thanks T.J, all the members of this forum and especially my business partner Phil for this successful and fun first full year of Off The Dock Toons!"

It truly is a great community of fishermen/women.  Like a few of you have stated, we don't always get along, but, in the end we are all here for pretty much the same reason....WE LOVE FISHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
514198,daryl0815,2010-10-23 14:24:00,225,"I joined because I love to fish, and I love learning more about fishing, there is always something to learn, and I enjoy sometimes sharing my fishing endeavors with other like minded people.  Since I joined I have broadened the scope of fish that I persue, learned some new things about fishing, and also gotten some advice on non-fishing subjects from the friendly and helpful board members. I just want to say thanks Fisherman and HTHM in particular for being so helpful.  The popularity of this thread just goes to show you the kind of good people that are part of this board, thanks for letting me be a part of it too!"

A tri-annual fishing trip with several of them is something I really look forward to.  Many talented people from all walks of life contributing to a forum that is able to help one another with most anything. Having a wide array of topics other than fishing also makes it interesting to hang out so the format really works quite well for those (like me) that do not always want to discuss fishing all the time. Yes, there is more to life than fishing"

Found his link to the spring fishing and boat show when I was looking for a boat, then read his online mag which led me here.

The support for members when they face difficulty (splashoppers recent loss comes to mind) or highs (births / weddings) is also really cool (hey joey - meant to ask--  that cooler - did it have drinks in at the wedding??)

Apparently there was some kind of argument going on here, so I had a look. That was about 40 years ago   , and I can't remember just what that arguement was about to this day. So I joined with the handle ""Dan"" to get my 2 cents in. Now, apparently there was another ""Dan"" already here already who quickly messaged me and told me that he was here first! Fair enough. I changed my handle to DanC. Never heard or seen of the other Dan since. I soon got involved in many discussions here. I think I was the lone Northwesten Ontario guy here at the time. To sum it all up, I've met a lot of great people on here that wouldn't have happened without OFC. I've fished with Mahumba, Spiel, Ron, Irishfield and Moosebunk. I've met TJ, Tennesseeguy, Brandon and Tjsa. I was sent new trailer lights from Big Cliff, free of charge. I consider them all good friends, and none of this would have happened without OFC.

513805,Gregoire,2010-10-22 03:24:00,1397,I joined because I was looking for info on fishing in Ontario. I stay for the fish porn and because I am passionate about fishing and want to meet people who are like minded.
513809,fishnsled,2010-10-22 03:44:00,3520,"Great thread Frank.  Well I'm a fishing addict and needed some weekday fixes to get me through to the next weekend. Came across this board via the old zoo board as well back in 2000/2001. There were some crazy threads back then but there were also a lot of good ones as well. A great bunch of people that were willing help out in anyway they could. Whether that be fishing related or not. Somethings never change.  Finally made it out to a g2g down at waterfront and met a few members. Some that are still here, some are not, and one who has become a very good friend. (Made a few of those here.) Since that time I've made it down to a couple g2g's on Quinte. A couple up on Simcoe and will have to make it up to Lakair one of these days. I would have to say it's the people that keep my here. The ones I have met and the ones that I have not yet but hope to one day. Yep, a great place this OFC Community."

I got some tips from TJ on starting out and eventually ended up as a tester for the company that makes this site's software. I asked TJ if he would be interested in trying the new fangled PHP style message boards. He told me to...well, he said no. As time went by the board became bigger and bigger and eventually too much for a cgi-based board. So we ended up here. It has been a fun ride. I look forward to the Nippissing GTG every summer. It has been my only vacation these last few years. Met all kinds of great guys and gals and we have all gone through trials and tribulations together. We sometimes get on each others nerves, but that what family does. The fact that each year we get o meet new members and somehow keep this thing running through sometimes very trying issues is a testament to the community. Our members are second to none and have given over $25,000 to the various fundraisers we have had in the last few years. We have seen some great technological improvements over the years and we will always have this site running on cutting edge software. We have never had any down time due to software failure. We do tend to be hard on the servers for some reason..heh heh. That being said there are more bigger things to come this winter, so keep an eye out for it."

513499,Beans,2010-10-21 00:01:00,3339,"About ten or twelve years ago a chap told me about the Lake Simcoe fishing board so I looked it up and joined...I noticed some of the fishing shows I watched listed their web site at the end of the show so I joined a couple...I met our good friend Nanook via the Bill Dance Site and met Photoz via the Simcoe board...  The Simcoe board did not like it if you mentioned other lakes and as I wanted some info on the Kawarthas, OFC was given me as the site to ask...  However, at that time there was a lot of bickering (flaming) going on so my query went unanswered and I got the info from Ontario Fishing but it irked me to be ignored so I sarcasticly posted a thanks for nuttin' post on OFC...not sure if it was Roy or Big Cliff who contacted me first to apologize for the slight but they said to stick around...I did and the good natured ribbing and great information still keeps me coming back...  Through various get togethers I have met a lot of great people, some who have become close friends over the years...  This board became a ""family"" to me when I saw how the members came together during Gerritt's bad time during the loss of his son...and many other similar times since...

513592,JohnF,2010-10-21 13:56:00,3494,"I was dragged back reluctantly to fishing by an old friend. We had fished together as kids on the Thames & Trout Creek but I got away from it by the time I was about 15.  After a hiatus of about 45 years Rob talked me into going wading with him one evening. I had no gear of any lind so I went to CTC and picked up a $29.95 combo and away we went. Did I mention I was a reluctant returnee? Well, the reluctance quickly disappeared and it wasn't long before I was the one initiating the trips to the creek. And being the gearpig I am naturally I began to acquire everything.  It wasn't long before I realized that Rob was only interested in fishing with cheap whippy rods, 4# test mono, and grey Rapala minnows. My gearpigginess of course had already led to a huge conglomeration of stuff which I had no idea how to use, and Rob was no help there.  Having had a great experience with internet groups when I took up scuba diving I naturally went hunting for kindred spirits on the 'net. I lucked out when I discovered OFC almost immediately. I had already checked out a few others but it was immediately apparent that OFC was the place for me. For one thing it was all about Ontario fishing and there seemed to be a great bunch of people.  I've learned an incredible amount of stuff about fishing since I joined up. I've also gotten to know some exceptional people who've helped me out IRL. Pretty much the same experience as I had with my diving. I met people from all over N.A. and ended up with invitations to dive with some of the best (literally). I feel the same way about OFC. I have such a backlog of invitations to join them to try pretty much every kind of fishing Ontario offers that I don't know if I'll ever catch up, but it's sure fun trying.  It's interesting to note the ebb and flow of membership as very active people appear and generate lots of activity for a while, then they fade a little or even completely. That's fairly common with these affinity groups I've discovered. Sometimes people just need a little break to rev up the enthusiasm again. Other times they simply don't come back. Perhaps they figure they have nothing more to learn or perhaps their fishing interest was a fleeting thing.  I've gotta give a special thank you to Garry2r's for letting me bunk at his place so often and ride on his nifty bassboat.  As well as hosting and feeding me, fishing with Garry is like a non-stop fishing tutorial on fish and gear. It's made me realize how invaluable a great guide can be when you want to learn how to do it right. If you haven't tried that style of fishing wangle an invitation to join someone on their BB, especially if you like going fast on the water like I do. But remember that speed means gas and gas means expensive, so don't be shy about offering to share the operating costs to a generous host. It's well worth it for the fun you'll have going zoomy all over the lake.  So that's my story. Nothing but good has come out of this association in the 4 or 5 years I've belonged to OFC. Thanks to everyone involved, particularly the folks who keep the site running. Also big thanks to the many who have taken the trouble to invite me out with them. I wish I had the time to keep up. This summer's medical setback sure hasn't helped but hopefully next summer I can make up for the time I missed this year.  JF"
513600,Harrison,2010-10-21 15:09:00,2202,"Simply put, I have become a more knowledgable fisherman because of OFC and hopefully I have helped others over the years do the same.

I will admit, as a newbie, I was a little put off by my initial impression that there is a ""clique"" here, but it's not really a clique, it's just folks who have met each other, actually, folks who have built relationships by putting themselves out there. I found that if you are willing to put yourself out there, give to the board, this board will pay you back in spades!

513410,Joey,2010-10-20 19:32:00,9122,"I was on another fishing board and was the only female and one guy picked on me constantly (no sweat, I gave back the best I could)     BrianB (Misfish) was a member there also and suggested I try this site as it was more friendly and had some women on it aswell.  That was back in 2001 and I'm still here today     I've met so many wonderful people and some are closer than I'd ever thought possible from meeting through an internet site.  I'm lucky to have met them    Thanks Brian  Joey"
513417,kickingfrog,2010-10-20 19:49:00,8333,"The obvious answer is: I am not done edumacating the masses.   I'll go and read the other posts now, and post a more serious answer later."
513420,Daplumma,2010-10-20 19:54:00,1961,I was researching fishing spots in the French river area and landed here a long time ago.I have met many of Cnandas finest at the gtg's and consider more than a few of y'all to be friends. Joe
513421,kickingfrog,2010-10-20 20:03:00,8333, I'm sure someone would show you terry if that's all it takes.
513423,grt1,2010-10-20 20:05:00,638,"I can't remember how I found the site but in the 2 or 3 years I have been on it I realized it is the best fishing site for the Ontario angler and I'm impressed with all the crap the members throw at each other and still remain friends, it sure goes to show that you have to be able to laugh at yourself every now and then.  Even though I'm living at the end of the road (almost) in the northwest I know there is a camaraderie with the members and several members over the years have gone above and beyond to help out fellow members in need. this is truly a caring board.  I still haven't met anyone from the board (DanC you should have called) but one day when I get some time I hope to make it to Lakeair and meet the gang at the get together."
513424,torco,2010-10-20 20:33:00,656,I joined because of the loads of information and its nice to read/see people's reports especially if life has gotten in the way and you haven't been out in a little while.  I stay for the above reasons and partly because of the interesting network of people on here.
513425,kickingfrog,2010-10-20 20:34:00,8333,"I had lurked on another board (at the time I didn't know there was a name for it) and when I tried to join the other site I couldn't. So I searched for another FISHING site and found this one. I didn't really lurk, just joined and started takin' cheap shots at terry (see above).   I've fished with a few of the members here and met a bunch more at various gatherings, even shared some 'Bama moonshine with someone in a skunk hat.  I stick around because I don't fish as much as I'd like (who doesn't say that?) and I like seeing how others are doing... fishing wise.  The other reality is that this collective of people from vast backgrounds and areas of expertise is very useful if I have a question regarding just about any topic.  Thank you."
513429,Old Man,2010-10-20 20:47:00,822,"First of all, compared to some other fishing forums I've belonged to, OFC seems to be friendlier and it's membership doesn't usualy engaged in as much bickering as other forums. I use to live one province west of here and the main provincial forum there was full of bickering, arguing and insults. This is a great place to share our love of fishing, our experiences and knowledge."
513431,adempsey,2010-10-20 20:49:00,1498,Joined because I like to fish and was looking for an online source to exchange information and ideas.  I stay because it has an active membership.
513432,irishfield,2010-10-20 20:49:00,26272,"Just wait Old Man... ""Winternet"" is coming soon!! LOL  I was searching for as much information on Temagami that I could find back in 2004 and came across the old OFC board. The rest is history I guess... where did those 6 years go?  Have made a lot of great friends, and fishing buddies, because of the participation on this site."
513439,aplumma,2010-10-20 21:37:00,6896,I was looking for information many years ago on the French River and found OFC. Daplumma told me he found a great website and sent me a link the next day and low and behold we arrived at the same place. I have been here almost since the first version was out and was member 300 and something.... Man has time gone by. I stayed because of how close people I have met have become to me and while I do not get up North as often as I wish I could ...you can be sure some of the finest people in the world live to the North of me. I would be afraid to list all of the friends I have made here over the years because their are so many and I am afraid I would miss someone. So while I may not show up on your doorstep be sure it would be something I would cherish forever.   Art
513440,Rich Clemens,2010-10-20 21:48:00,3131,"I can't even remember how I found the site or what made me sign up.  Dang memory is shot and I'm only 50.  But, like many others, I have met a lot of great people over the years, had the opportunity to fish with OFC'rs, exchanged some info, enjoyed reading countless reports, and it goes on and on.  The June GTG is great and I really look forward to that each year and already thinking about next year.   Great site and ya get a little bit of everything along the way.  Patient mods that try to keep all of us kids playing nicely.   There's just so much going on here each and every day, ya just can't leave."
513447,Tybo,2010-10-20 22:18:00,1373,Because Roy is here.
513449,danbouck,2010-10-20 22:20:00,4380,I came here looking for local fishing info and stay for the free beer
513450,danbouck,2010-10-20 22:23:00,4380," Funny, I think Roy stays because Joey is here"
513452,Terry,2010-10-20 22:25:00,14456," LOL I was going to say the same thing but thought,,maybe not"
513453,Rod Caster,2010-10-20 22:29:00,5784,A friend referred me to this site. I lurked for some time and then I joined because the other fishing forum I was using was boring.  
513455,Tybo,2010-10-20 22:34:00,1373,Dan. Keep your friends close and your enemies ......   Nice Fish!

513460,GBW,2010-10-20 22:53:00,8460,"Wait one second, the free info I get BUT who is giving out the free beer? Can you tell class sucks tonight"
513468,irishfield,2010-10-20 23:10:00,26272,His wife was offered free beer if they stopped in on my dock... but Dan sure wasn't...
513473,GBW,2010-10-20 23:15:00,8460,LOL. I wasn't sure if TJ was buying at the sportsman show and I missed it.  *edit* I think Dave Mercer should get a BEER sponsor and have them come to the shows too!
513483,kickingfrog,2010-10-20 23:22:00,8333, Talk about a loss leader!
513494,thatleetboy,2010-10-20 23:39:00,143,"I'm really, really new to the sport, and have more questions than I can ask.  Google led me here, and I never cease to be amazed at how quickly and patiently I get sensible answers to my dumb questions.  The classifieds seem amazing, lots of high end gear for half the price of new.   I've been on lots of other boards for my homebrewing hobby, and I've learned that the best boards, like this one, are not only active, but local. It's really nice to connect with people online, but building friendships with people who you can meet up with and share the hobby with can't be beat!  Sounds like there is a great group here...   Cheers"
513495,canuckjack,2010-10-20 23:47:00,121,"I found OFC looking to put me some knowledge on fishing in Ontario.  I came for some learning and I'm sticking around cause the learning hasn't stopped.  Just wish I had more to offer, but I guess that'll come with time."
513332,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-20 13:21:00,2690,"It has been almost a year since I signed up for the OFC board (lurked for a very short time before that).  I had never really bothered with any of the fishing forums prior to that time. My initial reason for joining was to gain knowledge, as well as pass on some of my own.  The reasons I have stuck with this board are many. Vast expanse of expertise from members throughout Ontario, as well as other provinces and the US.  A really good group of core members, that will take time to voice their opinions and share their fishing experiences. I have met some great people and made some really good friends in just one year on this board.  Have fished more new areas because of these people, and, other than hooking and playing a fish, fishing a new place is definitely one of the most thrilling things in angling...especially when you have success.  Anyways, this is also a thanks to those people (you know who you are) as well as the many I hope to meet in person in the future"
513337,Governator,2010-10-20 13:35:00,879,I started fishing regularly just a few years ago after moving to Barrie.  Just started doing some searching to gain knowledge.  Books can teach techniques but learning about Ontario fishing is best done here.
513340,rufus,2010-10-20 13:50:00,267,"I just joined a couple of days ago after lurking for a few weeks. I was attracted to the board because discussion is about fishing in a province where I do my fishing - and because it is an active forum. I do read a couple of other fishing forums but the discussions there are primarily about the USA or posts are few and far between.  I usually fish alone so it is nice to be around others that share my enthusiasm for feeling that tug on the line  <---- I can see I will need to change my Gravatar though.... There, that's a bit better..."
513344,mercman,2010-10-20 14:20:00,7054,"I found this forum by accident.Back in the begining of July, i had the opportunity to purchase a 14'princecraft, with an 8HP merc and a Princecraft trailer, Brand new from my Brother at a ridiculously low price.He won them at the Ottawa boat show. I have always enjoyed fishing but never found the time, and never realized how much the wife would enjoy it. I joined to re-learn the art of fishing, and to share in the passion that i found here while reading the forums as a guest. Its funny, even though i've never met anyone(other than Roy) i feel that i know most of you very well.Reading some threads i find myself saying' wait till so and so reads this, he or she will have something to say about it i'm sure' And so far you have never disappointed me When i joined, i thought maybe because i was in Quebec, and the name was OFC, that i wouldn't be able to apply the knowledge here, but i soon learned, fish have no borders, and are fully bilingual I stay here because i like it here. I enjoy the humor and the seriousness that i find here. and the knowledge contained in these posts has taken collectively 100's of years to acquire. Long live OFC and its members. I consider you all my friends.  "

513348,TC1OZ,2010-10-20 14:51:00,987,"Sites great for meeting people to go fishin with!  The non-fishing topics get pretty funny...  At the end of the day, despite all differing opinions, its a bunch of good people who love to fish! (that also own computers/can mash a post out/register for a forum)"
513358,HTHM,2010-10-20 15:50:00,4082,"I joined because I was researching fishing locations, I stick around because these are the only people who tolerate me....."

513364,bigugli,2010-10-20 16:26:00,6138,It's fun watching all the abuse they heap on TJ.
513365,limeyangler,2010-10-20 16:34:00,5204,"I found the site while i was still living in England. I was researching the fishing techniques so i had some idea what i was doing when i arrived to start a new chapter of my life in Northwest Ontario. Because we moved here mid-winter i spent the longest while on an icefishing forum, and was not till almost a year later researching fishing again that i found the site again and realised i'd joined previously......why do i stick around? cuz its awesome!"
513370,bigbuck,2010-10-20 17:21:00,2449,"I joined a couple years back and have met a bunch of people who enjoy fishing as much as I do. For the majority of the time the discussions are great and as with every barrel, there can be a bad apple or two. They get picked out and we go on. I've met a few of the folks on here over the years and they are good people. Yes some topics go off on a tangent and have nothing to do with fishing but we are a community talking to each other about what is going on in our lives. That is what friends do. Long live OFC!"
513371,johnnyb,2010-10-20 17:26:00,3413,"Found the board while looking for some info on fishing....was the first fishing forum I had ever come across...think it was still called a bulletin board back then.  Lost track of my log-in info a few times over the years as I moved around the province, but kept finding the board again and never lost my user name Stuck around for the insane amount of knowledge, good people, and because this board continually motivates me to get out and fish!"
513379,nancur373,2010-10-20 17:47:00,1211,"I joined when I moved here from Newfoundland. Didn't have a clue about Ontario fishing. Originally never planned on being an active member. Stick around for the friendly help, discussions, and joking. Great place to meet new partners. (of the fishing variety).lol"
513380,GBW,2010-10-20 17:51:00,8460,"I don't recall how I found the site to be honest but I'm glad I did.  I have learned a lot and met many great people along the way.  I just wish the ""hook up's"" section was still here as I've been lucky to fish with a few people from the site.  Now that skeeter's back he's already PM'ing me to get back out fishing...        Heck, I even got a job because of this site!  Shhh, my boss with probably read this when I'm done    then give me a look like    haha. I come back every day to see what everyone has been up to and look at the great fish porn too. Tiller?  Console?  Marshmallows?  It's all good.  Thanks TJ and crew!"
513386,SlowPoke,2010-10-20 18:05:00,2984,"Unlike some of you; I didn't discover OFC by googling 'fisting', I lost a bet  I don't recall how I found OFC but it was probably a google search of some kind. I do know why I stay. I've met so many great people over the years and even ran into a few I knew from decades ago. It's an active board with a wealth of knowledge and very well moderated. The get-togethers are more than just fishing now, they're a chance to catch up with new friends from all over the map. Its also caused me to try new techniques and fish for species I never would have bothered with in the past. I have to credit the tournament for that. Previously, I had no intrest in catfish, carp, panfish and whitefish but now I make room in my fishing schedule to enjoy them!  Cheers to all I've met, yet to meet and most of all, the mod's keeping this ship on course. "
513391,Garry2Rs,2010-10-20 18:29:00,1425,"I found the board in 2000-2001, I had just retired and had begun fishing seriously again, after a long absence.  There were a lot of new line types, fluoro, co-poly, fused, and braid and many new classifications of lures.  I was looking for some in-put and clarification...  The main reason I hung here is that there was one guy posting here who spoke English as a second language.  He was out camping and fishing every weekend.  On Monday he wrote about his successes and failures.  It was interesting to read about his successes, but he wrote so honestly about his mis-adventures that, with his slightly fractured English, I would find myself almost falling on the floor laughing.  These posts became the high point of my week.  In time he has become one of my closest friends and one of the best fishermen I know.  I was investigating braided line at that time, and wrote about my thoughts.  Many people had tried it before me, but most didn't like it.  I think we were still struggling with the idea of using 10 and 20 pound braid in-place of 6 and 10 pound mono.  Eventually these discussions evolved into a mighty thread called ""LINE"" that went on for so long it was finally closed by TJ.  I won an OFC hat by squeezing in the last post on the stroke of Mid-night...I guess I'm still closing threads...grin.  Some of the guys from back then are still here, others are long gone.  At least one has past-away.  A few like myself drift in and out, but like a bad penny, always return. Garry2R's"
