513464,GBW,2010-10-20 23:03:00,8460,Hey all.  Anyone hear from G.B. AKA SNAG in the past while?  CCMT and I both tried to get a hold of him and couldn't.  I know he's left the job he was at for a long time and took on something new so I don't have any of his info anymore to touch base.  I need to get a TO Pike fix in with him again.  PM me if you know how I can reach out to G.B. AKA SNAG.  Thanks.  Geoff

513585,highdrifter,2010-10-21 13:17:00,2534, I got a 3 piece tapped to the underside of my desk dude!!
513586,GBW,2010-10-21 13:26:00,8460,NICE! We'll work something out and tell G.B. to show up too.
513589,highdrifter,2010-10-21 13:35:00,2534, Big G is always down.  We would need to get to the water before we call him though...  He has a nasty habit of showing up before the arranged time so he can sting fish before I get to the water!!
513603,GBW,2010-10-21 15:15:00,8460,Sounds like a plan.
