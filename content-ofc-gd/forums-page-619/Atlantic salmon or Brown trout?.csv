513811,cjgraham,2010-10-22 04:28:00,104,Well it was another successful trip in the St Marys Rapids today. Lots of steelies amist the cluster of spawning Kings. Then I landed this hog. To me a bit to get him in thought for sure it was an Atlantic and didn't even occur to be that it may be a brown till I showed the pic to my buddy. I didn't even bother looking at the tail since I thought it was an Atlantic. Anyone want to give me some advice as to whether this could be a brown? I would imagine the rare Atlantic would still be lurking but I know there are Browns as well in the St Marys.

513830,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-22 11:46:00,2690,"Agreed on Atlantic, and, that is one crazy ass kype on that dude!"
513850,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-22 13:23:00,0,that's one ugly brute!  hoping the crowds of chinnies dies down so the crowds of chinny anglers goes with them.
513851,Rod Caster,2010-10-22 13:25:00,5784,"I would have thought brown but I'm not an expert. Amazing looking fish, my first thought was that it had a yap like a gar.  Kool catch!"
