513319,bassinator,2010-10-20 12:29:00,32,Anyone know where I can purchase Hali Sukkula jigs. Picked up a few at Bass Pro years ago but they don't carry them anymore. Thanks so much...Jeff
513373,johnnyb,2010-10-20 17:35:00,3413,"Picked up a few Hali's at ANgling Specialties in Mississauga....don't know which model...but if you're close to him, check it out"
513427,adempsey,2010-10-20 20:43:00,1498,"I am also looking for these jigs.  Do you have an address for that store?  Google comes up with three different places.  Do you know if they are all the same chain/owner?  I assume this is it? 325 Central Parkway West Mississauga, ON L5B 3X9 (905) 275-4972  Thanks."
513631,bassinator,2010-10-21 16:53:00,32,   Thanks Johnnyb I will give them a shout..

513661,johnnyb,2010-10-21 18:37:00,3413,"Sorry for being slow on the draw, but yes, as the great and mighty Drifter confirmed....they'ze be on Central Parkway right there in the heart of Missy-sogga"
513690,adempsey,2010-10-21 20:29:00,1498,Thanks.  I hadn't realized they had three locations.  The one in Concord isn't that far from me.  Definitely going to be making a visit soon.
