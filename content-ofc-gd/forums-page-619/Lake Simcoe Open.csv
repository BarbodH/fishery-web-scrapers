514276,misfish,2010-10-23 21:13:00,29133,Thanks again for the link   canuckjack.  Wow lots of great wieghts came in.  Add the gobies and thier going to get even bigger.
514352,canuckjack,2010-10-24 02:08:00,121," Yeah that was fun to watch, but it made me very jealous  So there's a bit of an upside to those annoying Gobies I guess ...."
514399,Cudz,2010-10-24 05:28:00,2652,"Gobies can't eat fish that are over 4"" so for the next 5 years we should have some big bass on simcoe.  The problem that might occur is that bass fry will not make it with the number of gobies around so after all the big fish die there won't be any more bass.  I hope I am wrong."
514401,bucktail,2010-10-24 05:41:00,1857,31.5 WOW!!
