513132,bassjnkie,2010-10-19 21:11:00,1101,Got my mine and my dad's for 77c last Thursday. Antlered or Anterless. Just got back from checking all the stands.
513188,mercman,2010-10-19 23:55:00,7054,did you fix your velcro issue. good luck and lets see pictures  
513189,irishfield,2010-10-19 23:56:00,26272,That sure cuts your odds Brian...
513191,ch312,2010-10-19 23:57:00,1590,"i have been 100% successful in antlerless and controlled draws in wmu's 89 and 90 since i began deer hunting 8-9 years ago.  i've had great luck so far stalking deer in the snow and getting close shots with my crossbow. stands are simply too boring and i often doze off. plus i see more deer while sneaking through the bush compared to sitting in a treestand.  that said, ill be out for the december hunt in 90 with my remington 870 that shoots 3"" outside to outside groups at 125 yards with a rifled barrel/scope/sabots. should be a breeze considering i have stalked to within 12 yards of 2 does and consider it easy with my crossbow."
513252,NAW,2010-10-20 01:48:00,4022,"  Same here...  Got it in the mail yesterday..  Of coarse I've already been out with the bow twice..  But I haven't touched my shotgun stand..  It's looking promising, the deer trails are beat to"

513787,AzuluSpookd,2010-10-22 02:09:00,348,"Perrrrrfect! Im in Nakina, on my way home from moose hunt #2 this year... I'll stop by this weekend..."
513788,irishfield,2010-10-22 02:10:00,26272,Like I said in the other post.. I had to beep the horn to get an 8 or 9 point buck off the runway before I ran him down with the tractor.
