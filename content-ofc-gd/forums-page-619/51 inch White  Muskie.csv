513836,ketchenany,2010-10-22 12:32:00,3229,"Published on: October 20, 2010   Paul Parise landed this 51-inch albino musky from the lower Flambeau River. www.muskiesinc.org  The musky Paul Parise boated on Oct. 6, 2010, from the lower Flambeau River in Rusk County is truly the rarest of the rare: a 51-inch albino musky.  ""That is a pretty fantastic catch,"" says Tim Simonson, co-chair of the Department of Natural Resources musky committee. ""Albino musky are pretty rare to begin with, and for one to survive to that size is pretty uncommon given they don't have the protective camouflage to hide from predators or sneak up on prey. This fish stood out from day one, but through luck and maybe some skill, it survived.""  The fish is the second albino musky to surface in Wisconsin waters in recent years. In 2005, a DNR fisheries crew caught a white musky in their fyke nets during population surveys. But that fish was much smaller -- 32.7 inches long and 7.9 pounds at the time.  Albinism is a heredity condition in humans, other mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians, in which there is a total or partial lack of pigment that gives color to the skin, hair and eyes.  The growth and development of an albino is the same as that of a normal individual. They also have the ability to reproduce offspring.  The complete story about Paul Parise's unique musky catch and release will appear in the December 2010 issue of MUSKIE Magazine, the official publication of Muskies, Inc. "

514060,TerryC,2010-10-23 00:07:00,196,"I'd buy that story, I have personally seen a picture of one caught in the north kawarthas about 2 years ago. It was not nearly this big but it was albino for sure. I will see if I can get a copy of the pic and post it.  Clarence"
514103,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-23 01:32:00,0,Nice Musky. Either way.
514206,skeeter,2010-10-23 14:49:00,1907,it wasnt white until you got it into the boat. stop scaring the crap out of the fish. what color would you be if something 10 times the size of you lifted you up and showed you a frying pan ?
