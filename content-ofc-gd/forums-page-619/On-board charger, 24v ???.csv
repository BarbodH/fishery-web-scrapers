514041,irishfield,2010-10-22 23:04:00,26272,My dual bank Pro Charger works very well.. that came in my Lund.
514053,DRIFTER_016,2010-10-22 23:54:00,10439,I have one of these chargers.  It's a three bank 15 amp charger that will deliver 15 amps to each battery in sequence but if a battery is fully charged it will leave it out of the rotation.  I have it connected to my two deep cycles and my starting battery to it. Most of the time it ignores the starting battery as it's usually fully charged.

514063,smally21,2010-10-23 00:12:00,993,i have a 2 bank minn kota  - does a great job on the deep cycles. doing it again id add a 3rd for the main battery - its never goin to fail to start the motor but you can fish for hours without starting the main motor and ill get low voltage signals from the electronics. also nice to have all batteries on a maintenance charge just plug it in all year. good luck
514072,archer379,2010-10-23 00:24:00,277,i have one from bass pro not all that inpressed with it i bought it in the spring and 2 new batteries twice now it has boiled the water out of the batteries in the manual it says that you can leave it pluged in all winter and it will maintain the batteries. I don't think i will be doing that other then that it works ok
