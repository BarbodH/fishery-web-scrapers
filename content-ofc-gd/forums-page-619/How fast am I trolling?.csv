513199,hunterjoe84,2010-10-20 00:11:00,52,"I fish in a tracker side console with a 25hp 4 stroke and there is no speedometer.  What would be the easiest, cheapest way of telling my trolling speed?  I know I can get an expensive gps unit, but cant afford that this year. Anyone have any methods?"
513201,Handlebarz,2010-10-20 00:13:00,3790,Try running next to another boat and get the speed from them then look at your RPM's it will get you close but then again water speed waves and wind will change that also best bet get a GPS LOL.  Or just go to your wifes car and take her TOM TOM
513204,Nipfisher,2010-10-20 00:23:00,2449,"Borrow someone's GPS and get your speed. Try with the wind, against the wind, in a sheltered bay etc. Then you will at least have an idea next time you are out."
513205,tknohpy,2010-10-20 00:25:00,162,"a simple handheld will give you speed, they are fairly inexpensive"
513210,ohhenrygsr,2010-10-20 00:36:00,947,I would invest in a simple handle GPS like the Garmin Etrex.  Great unit you can save your waypoints and double back on the extra same track you just made and see how far and how fast your traveling GARMIN ETREX
513212,Whopper,2010-10-20 00:40:00,2174,Do you have a Droid or any other type of smart phone? My son does and the GPS feature work for us last weekend when I forgot my GPS
513213,Terry,2010-10-20 00:45:00,14456,"I think this would do the trick  sorry I don't have much time for a full explanation  well you can make a half circle out of a piece of plywood put marks every 1/8 inch  put a line with a weight on it and mount in on the side of your boat  the line will move back to the same spot each time you go the same speed, so if you get someone in your boat with a gps and mark the speed and where the line is you will have a good trolling speedometer    <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=speedo.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/speedo.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>"
513214,irishfield,2010-10-20 00:48:00,26272,U shudda bin in ingineer Terry !!  (and don't anyone get your knickers in a knot.. Terry knows that I'm keeping my mind occupied!)
513217,Terry,2010-10-20 00:50:00,14456,LOL  I just came up with the idea when I read his post I really didn't have much time to give a good explanation or figure out all the details but it will work
513226,solopaddler,2010-10-20 00:58:00,8605,"  When I was 12 years old I bought a Mitchell 300 and in the box was a card to fill out and send in for a contest. Top prize was a trip with Red Fisher to Great Bear lake.  So I filled it out and a few months later I get a phone call from Mitchell Canada saying I had won a prize and had to answer a skill testing question in 1 minute to claim it.  I was practically hyperventilating as it was a math problem which wasn't my strong suit.  My mother was at my side with a calculator more flustered than I was LOL!  I was figuring out the answer on paper and came up with a different solution than my frazzled mom with the calculator.  Time was up and I had to make a choice. With my mother yelling in my ear I chose my answer and got it right.  So I'm waiting, practically ready to faint...totally expecting to win this trip with Red.  The Mitchell rep says congrat's you've won a trolling speed indicator  .  Can't ever remember feeling quite that crushed.  It was basically a plastic factory version of what you just drew.  I still have the thing somewhere."
513236,tb4me,2010-10-20 01:16:00,3295,LOL that has got to be the biggest kick in the boys if I have ever heard of one.
513265,hunterjoe84,2010-10-20 02:14:00,52,"I do have a garmin for the car and it tells the speed I am driving, but would it b very accurate at that slow speed?"
513267,solopaddler,2010-10-20 02:17:00,8605," Yes, problem solved."
513268,hunterjoe84,2010-10-20 02:19:00,52,excellent!!  Thank you very much
513269,splashhopper,2010-10-20 02:19:00,2931,  LMAO
513284,sauce,2010-10-20 03:22:00,219,"I've done a lot of trolling. And although its nice to know exact speed, I think intuition is a better indicator. Watch you lures boat side before letting them out. Most lures run best in ceertain speed ranges. Probably plus minus half mile and hour. If you think you're too fast or slow you could well be. Easy solution is to play with the throttle. Now if fish are only biting lures trolled at 2.17mph, then you have a problem. Try incorporating lazy turns, sharp turns, a speed burst or a stall while you troll. Straight lines are easy, but variety is a better way to nail down the hot zone."
513293,dave524,2010-10-20 06:44:00,4508," Remember those from the early years of salmon fishing, believe "" Grizzly "" was the company that made the most popular one. Ive still got a sailboat knotmeter that I ran for speed, little paddle wheel on a bracket on the transon generated a current that a meter on the console read in knots, 0 to 10. ""Pelican"" was the manufacturer of the one I had, this was all before the days of GPS."
513295,solopaddler,2010-10-20 09:27:00,8605,"  Y'know I think you're right, it was made by Grizzly."
513598,jedimaster,2010-10-21 14:47:00,3472,Just calculate the knots thats easy enough. just toss your anchor off the back and tie knots every 20 inches. Count the numbers of knots that pass over the stern.  1 knot is 20 inches per second. 1 knot is 1.85km's/hour  so if in 30 seconds you let out 30 knot's your going 1knot if you let out 60 knots in 30 seconds your going 2 knots.  You might want a big anchor rope to do this.
