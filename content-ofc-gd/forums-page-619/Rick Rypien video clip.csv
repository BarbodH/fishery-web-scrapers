513970,jedimaster,2010-10-22 19:14:00,3472,"yah really he is gonna be ""The Man"" in Minny for a while. He should have gave rypien a cheep shot smack in the chops."
513977,Rod Caster,2010-10-22 19:21:00,5784, The man? hahaha the zoo comment was the most appropriate. Embarrassing at the very least.
514058,tb4me,2010-10-23 00:03:00,3295,"good point.I mean he may as well at that point. Funny stuff. Rick Rypien has been suspended six games, will forfeit $50,000 in salary, and has only himself to blame for this sordid mess he finds himself in."
514165,fish_fishburn,2010-10-23 07:01:00,1311,"For acting like a minor leaguer he should have to ride the bus and play six games down on the farm. Having stated that, it's pretty hard to contain yourself when some idiot fan thinks he can spit on you because he has bought a expensive ticket."
513383,jedimaster,2010-10-20 17:58:00,3472,"Anyone catch the rypien video clip from last night? I grabbed a fan and shook him around. I bet Rypien is gonna get raked through the coals. Personally I think he should get a fine,and the next time the nucks play in vancouver during the first intermision the fan gets to kick rypien in the balls at center ice. Likley he is gonna get a big suspension, but I mean really is it fair? Domi only got 1,000 dollar and no suspension for soaking fans with gatorade then pounding a guy.  "
513394,Rod Caster,2010-10-20 18:48:00,5784,That was hilarious watching the fan trying to look all innocent and avoid getting kicked out. I had a good laugh at that last night.
513395,Chance,2010-10-20 18:52:00,420,"Rypien should know better,he will be lucky if all he gets is fined and possibly suspended.What he did is classed as assault and because it happened in a rink does not make it a lesser offence."
513402,jedimaster,2010-10-20 19:12:00,3472,The guy may have been asking for it but the last time I checked your not allowed to touch someone.It'll be very interesting to see what happens here.
513404,ADB,2010-10-20 19:14:00,444,He has been suspended indefinitely.  That really shouldn't be a surprise.  Something else that shouldn't surprise anyone...if he never plays a game for the Canucks again.
513409,Dozer,2010-10-20 19:23:00,896,That loose cannon wll be lucky if he gets of with little punishment.  That could be a lawsuit right there.  I'm sure Joe Buddy fan has lots of lawyers calling him up as we speak.
513411,bare foot wader,2010-10-20 19:32:00,1354," what do you mean ""look innocent"".....all buddy was doing was clapping and of course probably running his mouth but he was a home fan and that's part of the game....rypien is a goof, hope he gets suspension and a fine....he shoved sedin, too didn't he???  I'd be severely pissed if i was that fan"
513413,kickingfrog,2010-10-20 19:38:00,8333,"I'd like to see him get those dumb  yanke fans who interfered with the game last night.   Players can't touch fans.  Players can't touch fans, no matter how frigin' dumb we are, however sports teams need to do a lot more to keep their fans from having contact with visiting teams... see last nights baseball game for exhibit #1.  Bet you that wild fan needed to buy new drawers."
513415,kickingfrog,2010-10-20 19:41:00,8333, I'll all but guarantee that he was. Those $10 beers sure taste good.
513419,jedimaster,2010-10-20 19:50:00,3472,"Its not like he was sitting in the nose bleeds, someone paid prime dollar for seats that close to the game. I bet Gary is on the phone with the guy right now, offering him partial ownership in the Phoenix Coyotes."
513428,alexT,2010-10-20 20:46:00,2, that was so funny but he should not bin kickt out
513430,kickingfrog,2010-10-20 20:49:00,8333," He did squirt the guy, then the guy pushed on the glass and it broke, causing him to fall into the penelty box. The linesman came into the box and the fan was never hit by TD.  Not suggesting one is right and one is wrong, the incidents are just not comparable.  BTW the game was in St. Paul not Van."
513436,Rod Caster,2010-10-20 21:16:00,5784,"  He looked like a kid getting caught with his hands in the cookie jar. It was hilarious to watch I don't care what anyone says. Rypien was wrong of course, but that was worth a good laugh... sports are the ultimate soap opera."
513437,jedimaster,2010-10-20 21:17:00,3472, Domi definatly pumped him a few times. I remember even the interview with Domi afterwards he said he gave him a couple good shots.  
513443,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-20 22:02:00,0,"First he suckered the Pheonix player and then he hit the fan. I think this guy definitely needs to be humbled! Major fine and sued, and charged for assault!  The kid should sue Rypien for embarrassing him on TV, and sue Phoenix Coyotes for taking him out of the game(at least ask for a few free games), but I'd ask for more for wrongfully being ejected from the game I payed good money to watch! He payed his ticket and last time I checked, it is ok to taunt players(If even that was the case).  I agree. Tie domi got off easy. That can also be considered assault and he could have been sued."
513457,kickingfrog,2010-10-20 22:42:00,8333,The game was in St. Paul Minnesota.  The fan was not ejected.  The home arena staff MOVED the home fan to another seat right against the glass.
513500,kickingfrog,2010-10-21 00:01:00,8333,Remember Rob Roy and the Sabres beating on the Nordiques fan?    Milbury in the MSG stands?  
513862,jbailey,2010-10-22 13:39:00,866,haha it was quite entertaining. he should def be fined and suspended but charged with assault naaah  check out the incident at Ivor Wynne Stadium the other day.. http://www.thespec.com/news/canada/article/269690--hamilton-footbrawl-viral-on-web
513879,tb4me,2010-10-22 14:01:00,3295,I heard on the fan 590 (i belive it was Kipper) he said the kid spit in rypkin's face thats why he grabbed him..Still its a double assult.
513915,jedimaster,2010-10-22 16:24:00,3472,"noone here actually knows what happened, so its pretty hard to pass judgetment, but no matter what he shouldn't have gone into the stands.He will get a fine of 2,500 dollars and a 5-10 game suspension. Thats my guess."
513917,jedimaster,2010-10-22 16:31:00,3472,"well looks like he gets a 6 game suspension and the canucks get a 25k fine. Seems about right in my eyes. I would be interested to see what this guy gets.  I still think bettman will offer him minority ownership in the coyotes or the wild or dallas or some other team that is in the dumps. Maybe he will get some seaons tickets or something. I dunno, do you guys think he should get some kind of compensation?"
513924,blaque,2010-10-22 17:02:00,2419," Nope............especially if its true that they just moved him to another seat which makes total sense, as they didnt want this guy remaining inches away from the vancouver bench the rest of the night and have something stupid happen.  I think the whole thing is kind of funny...........the guy got his shirt grabbed. Its kind of like being at the zoo and getting a little too close to the monkey cage. This kid was too close and he got swiped at lol"
513929,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-22 17:11:00,0," I think HE should have been fined and not the Canucks.  I think the establishment handled it well if kickingfrog is correct. If anything, he should be compensated by Rypien. Rypien should fork up some of his cash, to the guy. I think $5,000(Peanuts for Rypien) is a good number or some free tickets. You just shouldn't be doing that to fans.  But if he did in fact spit on Rypien? Then that's another story. The kid should get punished."
513947,kickingfrog,2010-10-22 18:08:00,8333,"The player hasn't been fined, the team was. The player will lose 6/82s of his salary. Player fines are caped by the CBA, I don't know how much the max is but it's a lot less than 6/82. If he makes $500 000, that's about $37 000.  He may have some legal fees that may make that look like peanuts."
513954,Cookslav,2010-10-22 18:39:00,1457,"The guys a nut job, but hey....hey it could have been worse. Fines will be issued and all forgotten tommorrow LOL...  That dudes probobly got the coolest story to tell the boys now for years to come"
