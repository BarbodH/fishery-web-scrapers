513527,ra95,2010-10-21 01:54:00,49,"I felt this year is so windy that Simcoe Perch fishing is impossible. Visit once and only 5 boats around (no perch fishing boat school any more.) Last year, I saw 100 boats..."
513545,Rod Caster,2010-10-21 02:36:00,5784,"I tried to make some wind speed charts over the past 5 years, but alas the internet is not the place to find raw data. I'll see if I can make some graphs at work tomorrow. That will tell us for sure if this year has been the windiest in the last 5 years in the Simcoe area.  The wind is the most annoying element to battle when I'm fishing and I noticed that this year has been particularily windy as well. Unless you're trolling or in a controlled drift, it's nothing but a pain in the butt.... of course that's also part of the charm and challenge of fishing."
513553,mercman,2010-10-21 02:45:00,7054,its been windy as heck here in montreal too.When its blowing with the current you can actually troll a spinnerbait behind the boat.When its against the current the boat stays almost at a standstill.Its the east and west wind that really rip up the surface.I've become really good at controlling the drift with the minnkota
513584,Jer,2010-10-21 13:09:00,1426,I have to agree. Seems like it's been windy all year long. My Minn Kota is seriously underpowered for my boat which makes it all the worse.
513667,Rod Caster,2010-10-21 19:04:00,5784,"I have plotted the daily averaged wind speeds for the past 4 years on 2 year separate graphs in meters per second. It is difficult to put an overall value to the speed, but it looks like this year was NOT the windiest year over the past 4. (too much missing data for 2005)"
513668,mercman,2010-10-21 19:09:00,7054,"  hey !!! this is excellent can u forecast the next 5 ? good friends to have...dentist, mechanic and computer dude !!!!!"
513673,Rod Caster,2010-10-21 19:27:00,5784, Next 5 months? Snow and hard water!!!!
513676,mercman,2010-10-21 19:41:00,7054,  OH !!!! A SMART  ....................
513745,ra95,2010-10-22 00:01:00,49,Your chart is not easy to read for a conclusion...
513749,mercman,2010-10-22 00:11:00,7054,ya it could use a few pictures now that i think  about it
513752,Rod Caster,2010-10-22 00:24:00,5784,"  Maybe I should have translated it...  It is just plotted data so without averages and min/max's, you are right it's hard to conclude anything. ...plus I said it  looks  like this year will be the windiest year. I'm no scientician."
513768,ra95,2010-10-22 01:24:00,49,:worthy: Actually I was wondering if you can make it more difficult to come to a conclusion...

513776,Rod Caster,2010-10-22 01:44:00,5784," The gv offering confusing information? Not likely. No worries, one more day and I'm a civi again.  James, haha, If I had more time I'd make a more legible graph.... I've searched, but I can't seem to find any good weather sites that have historical wind speed records.  People only care about temperature records I guess??"
513779,cheaptackle,2010-10-22 01:48:00,849,"The gv offering confusing information? Not likely. No worries, one more day and I'm a civi again.  That's what I meant - after you're a ""civi"" you'll be able to get it right! You must be getting a little antsy about now...  Michael"
513932,bucktail,2010-10-22 17:22:00,1857,Maybe its only windy when i get out this year!!!
