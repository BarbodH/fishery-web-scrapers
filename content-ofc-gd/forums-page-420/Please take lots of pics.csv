684536,206,2012-04-07 13:45:00,563,Hey guys with this nice weekend hope you all get out and have some adventures....My crappie plans with my daughters were crushed in the wee hours of thursday morn I was in so much pain I actually took myself to hospital  Apparently it was time for me and my appendix to part...good riddance.  Anyway I'm lil down and out sitting at home dreaming of being out on the water.  Don't forget your cams and please post your story's so i can enjoy the great fishing from home lol
