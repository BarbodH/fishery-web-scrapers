685381,mike rousseau,2012-04-10 14:18:00,4661,just wondering how fishing in quinte is around opener and how you guys fish em...  do people still troll planers for suspended fish? or is it mostly a jig bite?  are there many of those quinte pigs caught at that time of year...?    i know around here a lot of spring and fall locations/techniques are the same...  anyways...  thanks for any info given  mike
685382,BillM,2012-04-10 14:26:00,17367,Used to absolutely SLAM them in Hay Bay during the opener..  Although it's got a lot more weeds then it used to.   Nothing but trolling harnesses for us..  Simple stuff.
685385,mike rousseau,2012-04-10 14:39:00,4661, on flats? on structure? suspended or on the bottom?  i heard eirie deiries(sp?) work well up there in the spring  i cant seem to find anything online about spring walleye in quinte
685390,leighfns,2012-04-10 14:51:00,103, Troll really slow and use bottom bouncers with a worm harness..  You can also catch them trolling (again real slow) with smaller crankbaits (ccshad or small taildancer).
685391,Harrison,2012-04-10 14:55:00,2202,"I fish the weed in the spring.  Weedlines, clumps and scattered new growth.  Bucktails are my favourite but will use suspending jerkbaits and dunk grubs too."
685405,Headhunter,2012-04-10 15:54:00,5703,Trolling 1/4 oz cranks off of lead core in Big Bay. Look for breaks in the water temps where shallow bays meet the main body of water and troll the temp breaks... I use lead core as it allows me to easily repeat depths and dial them in on the flats.... anything with purple from a crank perspective... HH
685407,mike rousseau,2012-04-10 16:02:00,4661,is the fishing very good in the spring?  like here we get lots of fish in the spring but all 2-3 pounds mostly...but 10-20+ a day...  i was wondering if the big girls still get caught fairly regular in the spring? or do you get really high numbers of smaller fish like us...?
685417,kickingfrog,2012-04-10 16:47:00,8333,"It's not like the late fall on Q, nothing is. There are still many 7-9 pounders but many more 1-4s. That's fishin'."
685418,hirk,2012-04-10 16:48:00,571,No thats not the time of year for them.
685420,Headhunter,2012-04-10 16:52:00,5703," As has been said, you are going to get small fish this time of year... biggins have already headed back to Lake O... 1-4 lb range and the occassional gator/water goat/silver bass/white perch.... HH"
685423,mike rousseau,2012-04-10 17:17:00,4661,ah...ok...   i was curios because i was reading about the kawanis(sp) tourney and wondering what the heck could draw/support a tournament with 5000+ people in it...
685425,Headhunter,2012-04-10 17:24:00,5703,"  Good eats would be my guess... although that said, I personally don't care for the flavour of Quinte eyes....  HH"
685431,mike rousseau,2012-04-10 17:52:00,4661,  funny how they can taste so different in different areas...
685436,Roy,2012-04-10 18:11:00,13728," Cause/Charity, I think."
685438,danbouck,2012-04-10 18:20:00,4380,We enjoyed it          I'm sure I'll enjoy it again this year
685442,mike rousseau,2012-04-10 18:31:00,4661,  nice...
685527,Mike the Pike,2012-04-11 00:46:00,3421,         I go to the Quinte opener each year there are techniques to catching the small ones and ways to catch the lunkers.  PM me I can tell you some Quinte secrets.
