I realize camping on lakes accessible from the road begins May 1st; however, I figured with the nice weather that the gate would be opened to permit access for fishing.  Any info would be appreciated."
685422,Oggie,2012-04-10 16:55:00,588,Try calling the Frost Center (705) 766-2451 or the East GAte of Algonquin Park. Somebody will know the date. Dan O.
685523,brkygetr,2012-04-11 00:36:00,425, I doubt it's open as that road is closed during the 'soft' season when the road can be beat by trucks ect. Call the water trails portion of the center and ask for Chris. He will give ya the lowdown.
