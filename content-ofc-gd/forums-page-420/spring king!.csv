684845,miller,2012-04-08 19:48:00,223,"lake was calm, water was green and i wanted to head out for a paddle. recently i added a few things to my kayak so i wanted to give it a test out on the water(rod holders, fishfinder, and little planerboards). i was hoping i'd hook into something and within my first 15 minutes i managed to get my first spring king out of the yak and man was that fun. paddled around for about 2 hours marked lots of bait schools but only got the one hit, i can't wait for more.  chrome!   new rig "
684847,mike rousseau,2012-04-08 19:50:00,4661,very cool...
684852,Joeytier,2012-04-08 20:03:00,3990,Wow that is a fantastic rig you've got there.  Nice fish to boot.  Are you happy with your elite-5?
684853,davey buoy,2012-04-08 20:04:00,5505,Nice fish and quite a nice set up.

684907,Pigeontroller,2012-04-08 22:44:00,2793,"A Chinook from a Yak, on Lake Ontario...Very cool!"
684916,MCTFisher9120,2012-04-08 23:03:00,3761,"Nice catch, very cool to see a salmon caught your style, hope to see more as the season continues!  Tightlines,  MTBF"
684917,Nipfisher,2012-04-08 23:06:00,2449,That`s a nice fish and a nice looking set up.
684928,miller,2012-04-08 23:42:00,223,"thanks guys, joey this was my first outing with it but so far so good haha. the only change im considering is just getting a thru-hull transducer set up."
684930,Grimace,2012-04-08 23:47:00,2020,"Right on, a Chinook from a kayak sounds like a bunch of fun.  It was beautiful out there today.  Fish were very shallow.  I really like your set up."
685005,spincast,2012-04-09 09:04:00,3279,geat way to break in the new fishin machine - congrats. I'm still hunting for my first king of the year.
685058,johnnyb,2012-04-09 14:10:00,3413,"That is absolutely fantastic, way to go!  Now take the shrink-wrap off that spinning rod!"
685088,ctranter,2012-04-09 15:19:00,543,"Miller that is a very cool yak setup, and one I would love to learn more about.  Do you think you could add a couple more pics of the yak from various angles?  I apologize if you have possibly done this already in another thread, but with warm weather around the corner, I'd love to get some ideas on great kayak setups.  Thanks!"
685099,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-09 15:46:00,2690,Now that would be a blast!!  Good stuff Miller!!
685103,Mike Pike,2012-04-09 15:51:00,1332,Nice job again Josh and thanks for showing us pics of your successes!
685106,l2p,2012-04-09 16:04:00,346,thats awesome! are you casting or vertically jigging? I once seen a video of guys vertically jigging chinooks on river mouths in Michigan. Thanks for sharing!
685263,miller,2012-04-10 00:36:00,223," i was actually trolling bodybaits with planerboards hahah, however i did hook into a chinook while jigging a spoon this fall when the bait were in thick"
685272,miller,2012-04-10 00:46:00,223," my kayak is actually probably one of the cheapest you can get lol, its the pelican pursuit angler 100 or something like that from canadian tire. i got it on sale for 349.99 down from 499.99 last spring. i wasn't going to spend big bucks on a kayak when if i had that kind of money i could buy a boat. the yak came with two flushmount rod holders behind the seat and one swivel mount in the front. the new toy i added on is just a triple rod holder from scotty and i grabbed a fish finder mount and swapped out the middle rod holder to use my lowrance. i run the powercord through the old rod holder mount to a battery in a ziploc tub and right now i'm just using a suction cup transducer but i might see about a thru hull. and i was using small planerboards that are maybe 6""s long and they worked great.  this was my yak before. now it just has an extra scotty mount on it with the toys haha "
685276,miller,2012-04-10 00:53:00,223," hahah never even thought about that, sad thing is i've been using it since september too"
685281,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-10 01:08:00,310,"Awesome dude, that must've been a great fight from the yak."
685616,miller,2012-04-11 12:32:00,223,it sure was!
