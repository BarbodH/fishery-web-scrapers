Water levels are great... even with the early spring and lack of and low amount of snow.  The water is now about 15 inches below the top of our docks, which is normal summeer levels.  Usually in spring the water countinues to rise and peaks about mid-May so it is still early yet and water is still coming up (although at a slow rate).   Checked out one of my favorite creeks for suckers yesterday, but saw no fish. So even with this warm weather they don't seem to be spawning yet.   Usually suckers spawn with the walleyes and this usually happens late April.  But maybe they are finished already????  Waters temps in Warren Bay are 44F and in Deer Bay up to 50F.  Went for my first boat ride on the West Arm this year on March 26 - that must be a record. Water temps that day were 34F and I had to break some ice in Warren Bay.  Cheers...  the cap't."

685221,Joey,2012-04-09 22:10:00,9122,Glad to hear you are alive and well Kev
685239,Nipfisher,2012-04-09 22:59:00,2449,Hey Kevin. I checked Chippewa Creek here in North Bay today and no sign of the suckers. I heard a few years back that when the dandilions are opening the suckers are in the creeks. Smelts are not running full yet either.
