685110,Headhunter,2012-04-09 16:08:00,5703,Well my brother has been using one for a few years now and it's the cat's rear end! What exactly would you like to know!? HH
685119,Fisherman,2012-04-09 16:46:00,7201,"It's ceramic, I thought it was cast iron.  I guess that will keep the heat in."
685123,cram,2012-04-09 16:58:00,1733,"Great for slow cooking. Not convenient if you want to quickly fire up some burgers.  Also, Costco has a knockoff version that's supposed to be pretty good."
685160,fish_fishburn,2012-04-09 18:39:00,1311,Are they worth the money?
685224,Headhunter,2012-04-09 22:25:00,5703,"Let's just say that my next BBQ will be an egg... A couple of points: -his egg (my brother's)heats up faster than my Vermont Castings gas bbq... he uses an electric start and he's up and cooking in ten minutes... just re-lights left over char coal from his last use. -He's got an electronic temperature control unit that allows him to slow cook things like brisket over night... it's killer! -absolute temp control for grilling! (or anyting else... he can get it up to 800F!) -can use year round -excellent smoker as well! -doesn't burn much charcoal and there are equivalant charcoals available so you don't have to buy ""Big Green Egg"" coal  My brother boughthis in the states, drove over at Pt. Huron and got it for about %500.00 less over there.  I'm sold!  HH"
685231,bigbuck,2012-04-09 22:48:00,2449,I'd like to get one. I have some buddies that swear by theirs.
685241,GBW,2012-04-09 23:05:00,8460,"yes, yes you are"
685274,Live2fish85,2012-04-10 00:50:00,1633,Friend of mine has one and they are awesome.
685293,GNODDY,2012-04-10 01:26:00,163,I just picked up the akorn kamado kooker from lowes for 348.00. This thing has the same idea as an bge just a lot less and a lot less fragile. You bump an egg and it falls over it typically cracks because it's ceramic. The kamado kooker is insulated steel which doesn't crack. I've done ribs and brisket so far and the neighbour's are loving me.
