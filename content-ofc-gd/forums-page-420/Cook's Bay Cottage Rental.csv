685931,MSBruno,2012-04-12 14:47:00,369,"Looking at renting a cottage on the South/Eastern side of Cook's Bay and I have never fished there because people always advised me to not fish there with my 15'4"" 74"" beam bass boat (1994 Hydra-Sport Z255, 1994 40HP Johnson).  I understand that my boat is not a big water boat, but if I stay within Cook's Bay, am I setting myself up for trouble?  I also understand that the eastern side of Cook's Bay will take the brunt of the winds and I just want to know if I should look to rent a cottage elsewhere.  Advice is always appreciated."
