685777,ecmilley,2012-04-11 22:13:00,2163,through 6 pages of this what i don't understand if it's a in season fish and your dealing with slot's wouldn't it then be frowned upon to measure it? and if you have time to measure it what's the big deal with taking a pic or is it were supposed to know how long it is thrashing around at boatside
685819,mercman,2012-04-12 00:14:00,7054," This is the key phrase of that letter.""Exercise discretion accordingly"" You may still get fined, or charged, depending on the CO or how he feels that day.  Discretion- the power or right to decide or act according to one's own judgment;  In the criminal justice system, police, prosecutors, judges, and the jury are often able to exercise a degree of discretion in deciding who will be subject to criminal penalties and how they will be punished. For example, the police officer may decide whom to formally arrest for an offense. For a traffic violation, a police officer may simply issue a warning.

685824,BillM,2012-04-12 00:26:00,17367, Why would it be frowned upon to measure it?  How else are you supposed to know if it's in the slot or not?  I can't understand why people make such simple things so complicated..  People need to stop thinking the CO's are out to get them...
685828,Sinker,2012-04-12 00:44:00,8692,"  In order to measure it, it must be in your possession. So whats the difference when taking an OOS pic? The photo probably takes less time.  S."
685829,BillM,2012-04-12 00:50:00,17367," Why are you comparing a OOS fish with one that's in season but out of the slot?  One is legal to fish for, the other isn't..  Doesn't get much simpler then that."
685830,Sinker,2012-04-12 00:54:00,8692,"Both are illegal to be in your possession, according to the letter of the law.  I could care less either way. I take pics of OOS fish all the time, and I will continue to do so. I also retain my slot fish long enough for a measurement, and usually snap a photo of them as well.  I know how to properly handle them though, and that is the key, regardless of whether they are in season or in the slot.  S."
685831,Fisherman,2012-04-12 00:57:00,7201,Did you pass an exam or just your opinion.
685832,BillM,2012-04-12 00:58:00,17367," One can be legally angled for, the other can't.   You don't see a difference?  As far as taking pics of OOS fish?  Not my cup of tea, but whatever floats your boat.  I hope you aren't counting those as PB's, lol!"
685833,Sinker,2012-04-12 01:03:00,8692,"Yes, I clearly see the difference, but I don't feel I'm harming the fish in either situation, and don't think anyone has or will ever be charged for it either.  I would have to get very lucky to beat any of my PB's, and they for sure are NOT out of season.  Don't get your knickers in a knot. Like I said, i could care less either way, what you do!  S."
685834,BillM,2012-04-12 01:08:00,17367,"I don't think I said anything about harming the fish, I was speaking from a strictly legal standpoint."
685835,ecmilley,2012-04-12 01:10:00,2163,"that is what i am trying to say, everyone seems worried about a charge from a co take the damn pic and let it go I not worried about what the co thinks"
685837,BillM,2012-04-12 01:17:00,17367," I could see the CO get on someone for taking a pic of a OOS fish, but not one that's in season and out of the slot..  That seems a bit silly."
685839,Gregoire,2012-04-12 01:29:00,1397,"I started this thread not because I am worried about getting charged by a CO, as I realize the chance of a CO coming up on you as you hook and land a musky is very low. It just bothers me that the regulations in Ontario leave room discretion on this issue. Why can't it be clearly stated that the angler is allowed to take pictures and measurements of a fish that is under the slot limit? (As is the law in some states) That would stop a ""rogue"" CO with an agenda from charging someone for taking a picture with a fish, which may occur after the fact. I understand the frustration that some people have about this issue, but I think it is worthy of discussion."
685840,BillM,2012-04-12 01:31:00,17367,"Why are you worried about getting charged with taking a pic of a in season fish?  Less worrying, more fishing."
685855,Gregoire,2012-04-12 02:15:00,1397,"Again I'm not worried about getting charged, as I realize the chances are slim, it just irks me that theoretically a CO could potentially charge me for taking a pic of a 40"" musky if he saw me in the act, or theoretically saw a pic of me holding one. Something about the smells bad to me."
685864,ecmilley,2012-04-12 02:45:00,2163,You got 6 pages of debate and really your asking the same question that I believe as been answered several times in many different ways. go fishing or get laid or grab a sock give it up or something
685866,mercman,2012-04-12 02:51:00,7054," What really needs to happen, is that the Regs need to be re-written to remove the possibilty of the CO using his discretion, and present them in a way that leaves no place for interpretation by angler or CO. Example  It is against the  law to remove from the water to photograph or measure any OOS species or a fish which is visibly under or over the stated legal size limit for harvesting.  Or something along those lines."
685867,Sinker,2012-04-12 03:10:00,8692," As a matter of fact, yes I did.  Happy now?     S."
685885,Gregoire,2012-04-12 10:46:00,1397," I'm asking the same question because it has not been answered in my opinion. I share the opinion, as others do as well, that the discretion given to CO's in this instance is unnecessary. If you grow tired of this thread than stop opening and reading it. Do not make inflammatory remarks in an attempt to get a similar response. I will not respond in a similar fashion as I would like this thread to stay open so that those still wanting to discuss this issue can. Thank you for adding nothing."
685892,BillM,2012-04-12 12:18:00,17367,It's been discussed to length already don't you think?

672071,graham,2012-03-02 03:18:00,14,"After speaking to 2 CO`s regarding taking pictures of undersized muskies he didn’t seam to have an issue with it. As long as you have the proper fishing licence that allows you to possess a musky and it’s in season and you release the fish healthy it is not something they would likely charge you with.  The only thing they said was that in thier opinion it could be considered an offence if it’s a musky that is out of season or you are in possession of the musky without the proper licence like a conservation licence where the possession limit on musky is 0. Basically they said it was illegal to posses a musky with a conservation licence or posses an out of season musky at any time and in the case that you hook one out of season or with a conservation licence you need to remove the hooks while it remains in the water. According to the CO, once you remove that musky from the water and hold it, even for just 1 picture, even for only 10 seconds, you are in possession of it when you shouldn`t be and the picture is evidence of that. However, as the CO`s told me they would even consider charging you if the fish is released quickly and in good health, unless they suspect that you are targeting the musky out of season or with a conservations licence. Yes, I know you’re allowed to fish musky with a conservation licence, but according to the law you cant posses one at any time, even for a picture, therefore if you have a conservation licence you are required to leave it in the water if you hook one. It`s probably best just to get a sport licence if you`re going to fish musky in Ontario.  Overall unless the CO suspects you are purposely committing an offence like targeting a musky out of season your chances of being fined for taking a picture of a small musky or any musky is not likely.

672083,irishfield,2012-03-02 03:34:00,26272,I see you've conversed with Bruce Ward as well Graham. Ask him what he thinks about taking pictures of Sturgeon with a sport licence.. that have a Zero possession... and he'll start to stutter and tell you that's different!
672201,jerdog,2012-03-02 16:33:00,39,"Graham - interesting comments from the COs and highlights how unclear the term 'possession' is even within enforcement.  Doesn't seem to make sense that possession of an undersized fish, which has a possession of 0, (especially one that is clearly undersized - you don't need a measuring tape to know a 30"" muskie isn't a 54"") has a different standard if you have a sport license.  Sturgeon has an added complexity also since they also have protection under the Species At Risk Act which also requires immediate release to avoid being considered to have hurt, harmed or harassed a SAR.  And in case you're wondering - SARA fines are WAY bigger than FWCA or OFR fines.  Hopefully, the COs choose to enforce the spirit of the law and not the letter of the law.  There's lots of more serious offences worth making a trip to court over."
672286,Sinker,2012-03-02 22:00:00,8692, Exactly!  The guys who are going by the letter of the law are a little paranoid if you ask me!!  S.

672649,lew,2012-03-03 14:31:00,12766," Here's a long story but it shows how some guys, in my personal opinion, get carried away with power, a badge and a gun.  About 12 years ago 8 of us with 4 trucks and 4 boats went on a week long camping/fishing trip to Quebec. We travelled east from Temiskiming  40-50 miles into the bush on logging roads and set up our camp beside a nice lake.  Our 1st morning we headed out about 6:00 AM and were gonna have a fishfry for breakfast. One  guy caught  2 small pickeral and cleaned them when he got back to camp. The rest of us got skunked so we decided to just save them till that night when we caught more.  We headed back out that night and came back in at 10 PM to be met by 2 CO's waiting for us on the dock.  They ordered us all out of our boats and one of them stood with his hand on his gun while the other went thru every compartment in each boat.  After the boats were checked they went thru our vehicles and then literally pulled our personal gear apart in the tents. They even checked inside our sleeping bags, all the while the one guy kept us ""covered"" with his gun.  The guy with the gun never spoke a word and the other  was one of the most ignorant guys I've ever come across.  When they found nothing illegal anywhere, they went for the iceboxes and when they came across the  fillets he went insane and accused us of poaching because the fish had been filleted and the skin removed.  We tried to explain that they were intended to be added to more fish for breakfast but seeing as we didn't get more we would keep them till later but he wouldn't buy it.  He said he was going to fine us $250 EACH and if we didn't pay him cash on the spot he'd have tow trucks come in from Temiskiming and confiscate our trucks and boats.  Eventually we talked him down and only the guy that actually cleaned the fish was fined but it still had to be cash right then or come back to Temiskiming at a later date for a court appearance.  We decided that $250 between 8 of us was cheaper than one guy returning all the way back to Quebec for the court appearance and the fine was payed. A reciept was given and they left us alone after that.  I'm not even sure if what they did was legal or not but we figured it was better than having our trip ruined anymore.  Yes, the skin should have been left on the fish till they were cooked, but under the circumstances I don't really see where we did anything wrong and IMHO it shows how some guys take the letter of the law waaaay too far."

672937,radar,2012-03-04 14:04:00,138,"I'm sure the concept of possession has been challenged extensively and there is a working def'n. CO authority and discretion are very broad. While there certainly are bad apples I'm sure most aren't going to stick their neck out when they stand the chance of being called to court to explain themsleves. I am not saying anyone was a jerk in any of these cases, but I'm sure a lot of times the fined party talked or acted themselves into the fine/consequence. Or perhaps past history was used as a deternining factor. The test would be, given the totality of the circumstance, would a ""reasonable"" person reviewing the facts find the party guilty of the offence. That is what court is for. If someone has a complaint file it. Get it on record. Get an incident report number if they are asking for cash. We don't want absolute def'ns because then everyone gets charged or no one does. Discretion is important."

672997,lew,2012-03-04 17:33:00,12766,"We'd spent many months planning this trip and were only into our 1st full day and figured it was much easier to just pay the fine up front and be done with him.  As I said in my original post, I don't even know if what he did was legal or not but it wasn't worth ruining a much anticipated trip over.  Closer to home we may have taken it further.  Kinda sad too really, cause we we're fishing in one of those ZEC's they have in Quebec and had payed about $100 each for the priveledge, plus 8 fishing licences, so we were about $1200 outta pocket just to be treated like criminals."

685684,RSF,2012-04-11 15:54:00,47," LETTER FROM MNR RECEIVED APR 11/12:  Releasing Out of Season or Undersized Fish:  Well Guys, it took over a month, but I just heard back from MNR:  ""Dear Mr. (XXXXXXXXXXXX):  Thank you for your email dated March 1, 2012.  I am pleased to respond.  The Ontario Fishery Regulations, 2007 indicate that a person fishing under the authority of a sport fishing licence must immediately return a fish to the water if the retention and possession of that fish is prohibited by the regulations.  If the fish is alive, it is to be released it in a manner that causes the least harm to the fish. A person is required to return the fish to the water without delay and in a manner that minimizes harm to living fish.  The objective is to do as much as possible to ensure the survival of the fish.  You had inquired about removing deep set hooks onboard rather than cutting the line at water level.  In many cases, removing deep-set hooks may be the least harmful way to release the fish, therefore assisting in its survival.  The Ontario Fishery Regulations, 2007 are laws that are put into place to help ensure the sustainability of Ontario's resource.  By quickly returning the fish to the water, the mortality rate is reduced and the fish lives to grow, reproduce and contribute to the ecosystem, and get caught another day.  When enforcing these regulations, conservation officers do so with the intent of the legislation in mind and exercise discretion accordingly.   Sincerely,   Lois Deacon Director, Enforcement Branch Ministry of Natural Resources"
671469,Woodsman,2012-02-29 19:24:00,1286,"In this case the CO would not have the authority to take your licence. Charge you yes. Whether it would hold up if challenged is another story. To the best of my knowledge the removal of your fishing privileges can only be done in court. Never heard of it being applied to single charges on the minor side of the rules (like your example). Now if you have a long history of offenses or are charged with multiple offenses (ie: procession of many fish over your limit, ect)than loss of fishing privileges is quite possible."
671472,pikehunters,2012-02-29 19:33:00,40,  Play the song & read the post's !!!! It'll get ya in the mood  Good One!
671482,Gregoire,2012-02-29 20:01:00,1397,"At least in some states immediate release is defined (apparently MN is one). I do not think that it would be too much to ask the MNR to include a definition of immediate release in the regs that allowed time to remove the hook, identify, measure and take a picture of the fish. I do not think that doing so would cost a huge amount of money, or require the regs to be re-written. I am not overly worried about this issue, and I definitely would take a pic of myself with a 48' kawartha musky or a 50' ski from LOTW. Having said that I think this topic is of more concern for a musky angler, as some like to keep accurate records with photos of the fish that they have landed."
671483,BillM,2012-02-29 20:03:00,17367,Not hard to keep the fish in the water and take measurements/remove the hook.
671494,Sinker,2012-02-29 20:21:00,8692,I think your being a little paranoid.  How are you supposed to know the length of the fish if you don't take possession of it for a measurement? Your worried about being charged for that?? Come on....there are bigger things in life to worry about!!!   I'd bet 80% of muskies caught are undersized....and get their photo taken!   S.
671672,Spouph,2012-03-01 02:25:00,115,"  Totally agree most are good guys.  I've made honest mistakes, too many rod, did not read the old regs right.  Fined me and believed me because I showed him in the regs the decrepence, but gave me all the tackle back so I did not have too stop fishing for the day.  I had to chew the fine but I was in the wrong.  If one fish is caugtht and photo/s are taken, prob no big deal, but to do multiple fish, you may be into trouble if you are handleing them poorly or taking too much time.  St clair co have had no issues with pic of catch and release.  yet again common sense.  The co's can see you before you can see them and they take photo's of the infractions from a distance.  I have seen them pic boats out of a crowd of 50 boats."

671721,BillM,2012-03-01 04:37:00,17367,So by that definition we shouldn't even be allowed to fish in C&R sections of certain tribs where a Sport or Conservation license has a 0 possession limit.

You have to package the meat so that you can identify the fish (skin on).  I totally didn't know this until I read the regs more carefully.  I'm curious as to this also, unhooking a fish in your hands when you already have your limit..."

I find it funny that poss possesion and immediately are put in bold in the regs, meaning that they are important terms for understanding the document, yet  both terms are not clearly defined.

671777,DoubleDigits,2012-03-01 14:00:00,140," No, you may now catch and selectively live release more than your limit, of walleye pike and bass, provided that...(the three points i mentioned above)"
671780,Garnet,2012-03-01 14:22:00,2056,Buddy was talking to CO recently and found out a family of 10 can posses 20 trout or any game fish. Even if theirs only 1 license in the house.
671789,Rod Caster,2012-03-01 14:39:00,5784,"  yup, it is legal to gift fish. I do this all the time.  For example, I catch my daily limit of 4 walleye, clean them, wrap them, and gift them to my grandma. Now I am done fishing for that particular day as my daily catch limit has been met. The next day I can do the same and gift the fish to anyone else.  This possession topic seems a little silly to me...of course a CO will give you time to take a regulated fish off a hook and to return to the water in a reasonable time. Are you guys looking for an exact time limit? ""you can do what you want within 20 seconds"" GRAB THE CAMERA, WE NEED TO BEAT THE CLOCK! haha."
671861,Fishenforcer,2012-03-01 17:58:00,18,"Unfortunately I am involved in other apects of enforcement under Provincial legislation. As with any type of enforcement, officers have the ability to use descetion and to be reasonable when exersing thier powers. Getting compliance is the best end result but sometimes warnings aren't sufficient given the nature of some violations(taking a picture certainly isn't a serious one). Also you get what you give so keep that in mind when dealing with enforcement officials, and people in general for that matter!!!"
672031,Mikeyfish,2012-03-02 02:28:00,21,"A co in my mind should be someone I would like to feel good to be around, respect, trust, have good common sense and catch the people that are really disrespecting the rules. I’ve seen charges laid that are really discussing and embarrassing. I have hunted and fished for 40 years and haven’t been charged with anything yet. I quit hunting because I can’t keep up to the rules, regulation changes, and politics, fishing regulations are enough for me to handle now. As much as I hate to say it, I believe that some co’s power has gone to their head. If looking in the gray areas is the only way they can push their power, on the little guy, it is sad. I fish lots and I try to make sure my ( i s are doted and my t s are crossed ) and still dread the day when I’m stopped because I forgot something."
671337,rhare,2012-02-29 16:42:00,387,   Has anyone actually been charged after the photo was taken?
671338,fishindevil,2012-02-29 16:43:00,6254,"daveMC has is correct,you have to release a out of season fish immediately and not take a photo or you can be charged fish must be released right away without any delay when some guys got arrested on our lake back in the spring for over limit crappies,as well as out of season bass,i asked the CO"
671340,Gregoire,2012-02-29 16:44:00,1397," I don't know, but the fact that they could bothers me, in case you haven't noticed. I just think that this issue should be clearly stated in the regulations as it is a common practice."
671341,BillM,2012-02-29 16:45:00,17367," How is it black and white?  You just stated in a previous reply about having it out of the water for a certain amount of time to remove a deeply hooked fish.  There are way too many variables to even consider this a black and white issue.  Time out of water, reason for it being out of water, handling of the fish while it's out of the water, etc etc etc."
671342,Billy Bob,2012-02-29 16:46:00,5865," My ""guess"" would be NO.......but think about this.....what takes more time....trying to settle down a musky for measurement or taking a quick photo....that would be my defence if I ever got a ticket for taking a picture of a illegal fish....what if it's a quarter inch too short...should you be fined for measuring it and then releasing the fish.....I agree....this is a stupid thread."
671346,Gregoire,2012-02-29 16:49:00,1397," My concern here isn't out of season fish, but fish that are in season but outside a size regulation."
671349,Gregoire,2012-02-29 16:55:00,1397," I think right now we are arguing back and forth for the sake of argument. I am saying that I would like the MNR to clarify the rule so that a CO cannot charge someone who removes an in season fish that is outside the size limmit for the purpose of a photo. You are probably right that no CO would charge someone for doing so, but I would feel better if this was written in to the regulations. If you read my posts closely you will see that I am asking for clarification in the regulations. In my mind this mean taking an issue thta is grey and making it black or white. At least that is how I see it."
671352,BillM,2012-02-29 16:58:00,17367,Perhaps the MNR should define the word 'Possession' a bit better for us.  I'm sure that would answer a lot of the questions.
671353,Gregoire,2012-02-29 16:58:00,1397, If you don't like the thread don't read it or comment on it. I started it because I have a genuine interest and I believe it is an issue that should be clarified. Being an active member of this forum does not mean you have to comment on every open thread. You are free to leave this topic alone and only comment on threads that you think are not stupid. I would actually prefer if you did that.
671354,Gregoire,2012-02-29 16:59:00,1397, agreed
671356,Billy Bob,2012-02-29 17:05:00,5865, OK....not a stupid thread if you're that concerned about the answers you request......then I would contact your MNR for the correct answers....here on this forum you will only get opinions and that is what I gave you.
671359,rhare,2012-02-29 17:10:00,387,"  I'm sorry but it's really hard to understand what is going on here...  But I agree we should re-write the regulations because you feel threatened by the possibility of getting a fine for having a picture of a musky that isnt with in the slot size but is in season...  seems like money well spent to me...  It's defiantly one of the big issue we have today on our lakes and rivers. In all seriousness, if it's that big of a concern to you then just don't do it. The simple fact that it's done ALL THE TIME and no one has ever been charged is good enough for me..."
671360,Gregoire,2012-02-29 17:10:00,1397," I asked for opinions about what the legal implications are regarding taking a picture of a fish that is technically not legal, and engaged in conversations about clarifying the regulations. At no point did I ask for your opinion about whether you though this thread was relevant or not. Why you felt a need to express that latter is beyond me, I just wanted to let you know that I did not appreciate it. By stating this is a stupid thread you are insinuating that I am stupid for starting the thread, and I do find that insinuation somewhat offensive."
671362,Gregoire,2012-02-29 17:14:00,1397," I do not think that it would require re-writng the regulations, rather it would invovle clarifying the issue on what possesion means. In terms of cost and use of resources I imagine a clarification of this issue would be much less coslty than a court case challenging what possesion means."
671364,mike rousseau,2012-02-29 17:16:00,4661,  mmmm... the black and white cookie.... a perfect balance of harmony on a cookie...
671365,Gregoire,2012-02-29 17:18:00,1397,I'm going to stop responding to comments posted on this thread as I want it to stay open so that I can get others opinions on the topic. Thank you for sharing your thoughts so far.

You can't just clarify a part of possession with out having it written somewhere.I'm sure it's not as easy as just tossing a new page in the regs. There would be some serious cost involved.  Anyways, futile argument. I'm sorry it bothers you that it doesn't say in writing you can take a picture of your fish. I think it's a common sense issue. Not to insinuate that you have no common sense, I just think that they leave areas like this out so its a small reg book not the holy bible of regulation that takes 30min to find something in.  tightlines  Ryan"

671399,Fishenforcer,2012-02-29 17:45:00,18,There are set fines for offences or the Provincial Offences Officer can 104 summons you to court.
671404,solopaddler,2012-02-29 17:50:00,8605, Welcome to the board.  Are you involved in fisheries enforcement? Would be great if we had our own in house member to answer these questions.
671452,Gregoire,2012-02-29 19:01:00,1397,Apparently there is a CO working in Ontario that interprets the rules quite literally and will fine anyone who he catches taking a undersized fish out of the water. I got this information from another board. While it is very unlikely that you would run into that CO at the exact time that you are taking a pic it is possible. It is for this reason that I think the regs need to be clarified. I think that this type of variation in enforcement of the regs is wrong.
671454,BillM,2012-02-29 19:04:00,17367,Rogue CO's?  We better watch out!
671463,express168,2012-02-29 19:13:00,327,"I don't see what is difficult about determining possesion, if you remove a fish from the water it is in your ""possession"" until returned to the water. Logically a CO would give you a reasonable amount of time to properly return the fish to the water based on each circumstance. It is not black and white, if it states it is ok to photograph the fish in the regs does that mean 4 people in the boat can do it, if your batteries are dead can you wait to change them before returning the fish etc etc. By the way how would you be charged if you photographed an undersized fish and released it, the CO wouldn't have the fish to prove it was undersized. If the fish is out of the water long enough for the CO to come over and check its size before you release it I would say that is a bit longer than a quick picture."
671227,Gregoire,2012-02-29 13:37:00,1397,"Hi all, This question came up on another board, and I did a google search, but could not really find the information that I was looking for. My Question is: Is breaking an Ontario fishing regulation an criminal offense. So would you have to go to court, or is it more like a traffic ticker where you can just pay a fine. This question came up as a result of a discussion on whether it is legal to take a photo with a Musky that is unders the size limit. I am just wondering if a CO does charge a person, which he may be able to do, what the charge would be a what possible consequences one could face."
671233,Muskieman,2012-02-29 13:51:00,2472,"I've never heard of getting charged for taking a picture of an under sized fish , folks to it all the time , I guess that that would also apply to a slot size Walleye, I suppose if the fish was kept out of the water for an extended period of time it would be different, but on the other hand it is in your possession... As for a court date yes, you must attend court , I was once charged for fishing in a sanctuary ( misprint in regulations 2005 for then Zone 27) I fought it in court and won my case..  Randy "
671246,bigugli,2012-02-29 14:13:00,6138,"Criminal offences are those listed in the CCOC, a federal body of laws, and quite extensive. Try reading it some time Almost all fishery regulations are provincial. There are also some federal regulations that a CO will enforce, but I don't recall any that are includrd in the Criminal Code."
671249,BillM,2012-02-29 14:18:00,17367,Not a criminal charge.
671250,SmokestackLightnin,2012-02-29 14:18:00,390,"It would be hard to prove that a taking a picture of a fish is actually ""possession"".  As for criminal charges, COs in Ontario enforce the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. The majority of penalties are fines and equipment seizures with no effect on your criminal record."
671255,Gregoire,2012-02-29 14:27:00,1397,"So it is just a fine...If it is not a criminal charge why do you have to appear in court. I also remember reading something about the Ontario Fishing Regulations being enforced according to the fisheries act, which is a federal act. Wouldn't that mean that the regualtions are in fact enforceable as law?"
671256,BillM,2012-02-29 14:31:00,17367," You don't have to appear in court, you only do if you want to challenge it.  If you challenge it you appear in Provincial Court.   Of course the regs are 'law' why would you assume otherwise?"
671257,mike rousseau,2012-02-29 14:33:00,4661, i didnt have to go to court when i got dinged for fishing walleye out of season (thought one bridge was a border but it was another...  )  $250 each... no fish in possession...  but WE CHOSE to go see the justice of the peace and explain what happened and he cut the fine in half...
671259,SmokestackLightnin,2012-02-29 14:34:00,390,"There are numerous Acts and Regulations that Ontario CO's both enforce and administer. As mentioned, the main one the Ontario Provincial Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. Court appearance is an option if you don't want a CO to be both judge and jury. The other consideration for having a court appearance is violation of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act can lead to up to 2-years imprisonment for Commercial Offenses and up to 1-year for General Offenses."
671261,Gregoire,2012-02-29 14:35:00,1397, That makes total sense.  Who determines the fines? Is there a set fine for specific violations as there is for traffic violations?
671262,BillM,2012-02-29 14:36:00,17367," Yup, set fines..  Don't ask me how I know this, lol"
671265,craigdritchie,2012-02-29 14:40:00,1586,"Depends what you're charged with. Most fishing offenses are provincial, but there are a handful of instances where federal regs overlap. Some guy taking a quick picture of an undersized muskie would not be in that situation."
671272,Gregoire,2012-02-29 14:47:00,1397,"So at worst case a fine, and maybe confiscation of equipment. Could your fishing liscence be revoked as welll?"
671279,SmokestackLightnin,2012-02-29 15:03:00,390, Yes
671285,wallacio,2012-02-29 15:19:00,475," LOL...trust me, Bill is an expert on these matters!!!!"
671305,Gregoire,2012-02-29 16:07:00,1397,It just strikes as unfair that a CO for whatever reason could choose to fine you and take away your fishing liscence for something like taking a picture of an in season fish. I know it is unlikely to happen but the fact that it could makes me uncomfortable. Loosing my fishing equipment would not be as serious to me as would be loosing the previlidge to fish. Has there been a push to clarify the regulations? Or is this a situation where someone with money or influece will need to be charged and then challenge the Regulations in court untill the MNR is forced to clarify this issue.
671308,BillM,2012-02-29 16:15:00,17367, The judge would throw that ticket out...  Most CO's I've run into are good guys.
671310,DaveMc,2012-02-29 16:18:00,89,"yes, it is unlikely to happen, but according to several CO's, the local MNR office, the District MNR office and the Peterborough office, as soon as you remove a fish from the water (even to take a quick pic and then release) it is considered to be in your possession."
671315,Gregoire,2012-02-29 16:25:00,1397," It is the fact that I would have to appeal to a judge, take time set and travel to a court date, and not be able to fish untill the issue has been resolved that bothers me. I think we need clarification on what possession and immediate means. I would like the MNR to declare that removing a fish from the water for a quick picture is not a violation as long as the fish is in season, despite the fact that it may not meet size requirements. Just to add to this issue, it is not always to remove, or cut hooks in the water. If a fish takes the hook deep sometimes you have to remove it from the water in order to remove the hook, especially if you do not have the proper landing gear. In this case you would be in possesion of the fish and possibly face a fine when all you are doing is trying to remove the hook."
671317,Fisherman,2012-02-29 16:26:00,7201," The fish has to be out of season.  As for ""immediately"", it's open to interpretation that's a whole other can of worms.  I would take it to mean don't even take the fish out of the water.  If you were hanging onto a live 220V line, would you like me to turn off the power immediately, or would you like to roast your jewels a few seconds more while we take a picture.  It's no different than the ""do not allow consumable fish to go to waste""  if it out of season and dies, you still have to throw it back."
671318,Billy Bob,2012-02-29 16:29:00,5865, Billy.....BILLY....fess up BILLY.....tell all.....how many times have you been written up....how many times have you been FINED.....and finally....HOW MANY TIMES did they send you to the Big House....did you meet your new boyfriend BUBBA there....you know the guy you always meet on the second Friday of every month ALONE....  ENQUIRING MINDS want to KNOW.....       (just having a fun with you buddy)
671322,BillM,2012-02-29 16:31:00,17367," The problem is each circumstance is different..  This is why it's up to the officer in question to make the decision..   If these were black/white issues then I could understand, but as you pointed out they aren't."
671332,Gregoire,2012-02-29 16:38:00,1397," I agree with your point, but I think you are missing mine. If a judge would throw out a ticket for briefly removing a musky that is smaller that say 44"" in the Kawartha's than a CO should not be able to lay the charge in the first place. This matter should be clarified and not left up to a CO to determine. Maybe something like ""An angler catching a fish that is in season but can not be kept due to size restrictions can briefly remove the fish from the water for a photo. If an angler removes an out of season fish for a photo, he/she can be charged with violating the Ontario Fishing regulations. "" To put my opinion in other words: I do not think that anglers should be subject to a charged if they are doing something that is commonly accepted and seen as having little harm on the fish.  I hope I didn't just open another can of worms with that last comment."
671333,BillM,2012-02-29 16:40:00,17367,CO's aren't going to charge you if you are doing something that's commonly accepted..  Have a little faith man   The world is not black and white.
671336,Gregoire,2012-02-29 16:41:00,1397, As I just indicated I think this particular issue is Black and White. Any fish that is caught in season but falls outside of a size restrictions. Either you are allowed or not allowed to remove the fish from the water for a picture. I do not think that a CO should be given discretion to give a ticket that would be thrown out by a judge in every situation that I can think of.
