685331,Freshtrax,2012-04-10 03:43:00,2215,got a later start than i would have like as my other half was invited and she diddnt like the idea of waking up at 5 am to go fishing.    on the road  getting closer   almost there   now only an hour paddle    only caught one all day but what a great way to spend a day.  I should have brought flies. when I cleaned him he was STUFFED with bugs. I wish we could have got some pics. but the camera was un co-operative on the way in we ran across a pair of otters who came right up to the canoe and checked us out. they were quite playfull and curious. i guess they dont get many visitors.  http://i101.photobucket.com/albums/m49/aninaa/IMG-20120407-00203.jpg[/img]   tight lines
