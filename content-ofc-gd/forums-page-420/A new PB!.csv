685084,Lip-ripper,2012-04-09 15:13:00,228,"It may not look like much, but that is an XL Timmies cup next to it! lol (Not the new elephantine XL cup, the old one, and you can see the XL marking on the bottom of it where it's squished.) Far and away the biggest smelt I've ever caught or even seen. I've heard of them getting that big in the great lakes but not that big around here. We ended up with a decent amount but they weren't running heavy.  Not a super exciting report but a report none the less...  "
685085,BillM,2012-04-09 15:14:00,17367,I think you should mount that one.
685090,Lip-ripper,2012-04-09 15:22:00,228,I'm considering it...
685094,mike rousseau,2012-04-09 15:28:00,4661,  lol....  it would make for a couple funny conversations...lol  and cheap too
685097,krixxer,2012-04-09 15:39:00,274,how do you eat em'? never had any myself
685098,BillM,2012-04-09 15:44:00,17367,Don't EAT IT!!! You could be potentially be eating a World Record!  Call the IGFA stat!

685109,Rod Caster,2012-04-09 16:07:00,5784,I wonder if we crossed paths yesterday.
685111,Lip-ripper,2012-04-09 16:10:00,228," I like them done in beer batter. They are one of my favorite fish to eat...    Possibly, I was there from 9:30 til midnight..."
685112,Rod Caster,2012-04-09 16:13:00,5784,  We left at 12:30. Saw a few wall worthy smelts as well.
685115,kickingfrog,2012-04-09 16:32:00,8333," Please make it a replica mount, that's a prime spawner.  I haven't been smelting in years."
685117,solopaddler,2012-04-09 16:39:00,8605,"  Knowing you, you mean that literally don't you?"
685240,Christopheraaron,2012-04-09 22:59:00,3525," not sure how they are in the great lakes but I say that the best way is just cut off the heads, then fry them in butter the bones are actually pretty nice and crispy, good to have for a breakfast."
685248,SirCranksalot,2012-04-09 23:24:00,3291, Pervert!!
685262,Moosebunk,2012-04-10 00:33:00,3970,"They kinda smell like cucumbers those smelty fish.  And ya know what they say, smells like chicken... smells like fish... but I dunno about cucumbers?  Anyways dood!  Congrats on your PB smelt."
685283,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-10 01:12:00,310,What a beast!!! Cong on the PB.
685302,limeyangler,2012-04-10 01:58:00,5204,i think they look like little Tarpon
685633,Nipfisher,2012-04-11 13:05:00,2449,"Don't know if you measured that one Ryan, but here is some bigger ones from last night. Only the biggest one is from our secret creek. All others are from same place you were.        Sink shot will be in the other Smelt thread."
