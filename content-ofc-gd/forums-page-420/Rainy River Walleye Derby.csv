I knew it was going to take a big fish to win, and lots of 6lbers would be caught released. I figured it would take 8 or so pounds to win this biggest fish derby.  I got up early in the morning to some suitable conditions, but it was pretty cold. Around -2, but no wind at the time. With rods/tackle ready, me and my partners hit the water with a plan based on previous experience. I had figured the smaller males would be a little deeper, and the big females would be on the feed shallow, near a current seem off a sandbar. We anchored up and wet our lines...  Only one other boat seemed to have a similar idea as us. Within the first 5 minutes, an angler in the other boat landed a nice fish, which appeared around 5lbs or so. Phew, it wasn't the behemoth, lol. Within seconds, we were managing a triple header in our boat, and I knew all three fish would call for a net. So we kept line taught while one at a time we landed are fish. Fish one, about 5lbs, fish two, maybe just a tad bigger, fish three was a keeper, I figured about 6lbs, give or take.  For the next hour, we were pounded by rain, cold rain. But we were landing fish after fish the whole time. It was one of those days where the plan was flawless. Then the wind picked up outta nowhere to about 50km. Are hands were stinging cold from landing fish and the wind blowing, but our spot was actually marking a rise in water temps to about 44 degrees. Then, outta nowhere, the wind vanished and the sun made an appearance, and gave us a chance to warm up a bit.  The other boats didn't appear to be doing much at all, aside from a few pro's landing the odd sturgeon here and there. The boat beside us had a few more nice ones, and his last one looked to be a potential winner.  Ok guys, 1.5 hours left to fish, lets fish hard for that one big bite! Oh wait, the MNR decides to pay us a visit, lol. First time thats ever happened mid derby. They checked our liscenses, and our catches, at each boat. They were very respectful and tried to be quick, actually apologizing for the incovenience. We thank them and invited them out to fish when they had a day off, lol. Ok, that took a half hour outta the derby, and the weather turned once again. It started pouring, winds were gusting around 70km. We couldn't hold our spots, nobody could. The last hour we had a 20 minute sturgeon battle, quickly released that fish, and tried for one more bite. It didn't come.  5 pm came and we made for shore to weigh in. The guy beside us weighed in at 7lbs 11 ounces I believe. The biggest we could muster was 7lbs.  Some generous folks were waiting for us on shore with some cold beer (which is horrible after sitting in the cold rain/wind for 6 hours, lol) and some sandwiches. Very generous indeed, and much appreciated. We visited over beers, shared some stories and headed home to warm up the soul and relax.  All in all it was a great day. I managed to snap 2-3 quick pictures between fish, and all involved had a blast.  My favorite moment of the day was when my partners hat blew off into the river. I had a lipless crank on so it was my duty to at least try to snag it as the current pulled it away. One cast, even with horrendous winds, and I managed to snag it, hahaha. We all had a good laugh about that and I got a few comments on my casting from a couple local pro bass anglers. It was a real bugger to get my treble hooks outta that leather hat though, lol.   Spinnerbait walleye           A nice lil guy            This was a decent one caught in our boat            Another good one came on a jig/minnow            from the boat beside us             "

684975,mike rousseau,2012-04-09 02:16:00,4661,Cool...  Can't wait for the tourneys this year...
684977,manitoubass2,2012-04-09 02:26:00,11391, Me either. I'm pretty anxious to get things rolling.   
684978,mike rousseau,2012-04-09 02:32:00,4661,"After my amazing year last year I'm so anxious to expand on what I learned this year and keep on trying to zero in on the ""big fish"" spots and techniques...  Also pumped to get a better spring pattern going..."
684980,manitoubass2,2012-04-09 02:38:00,11391," Sounds exactly like me MM! lol.  My year has started off with a serious bang, and the things I learned last year have me well ahead of the curve.  This is my first year doing tournys so I'm very anxious to get the experience of the first one and just get it outta the way.  I lucked out big time though and have an awesome partner for the year   "
684981,NAW,2012-04-09 02:39:00,4022,That was a good read!  Make's me anxious for Walleye opener down here!
685031,limeyangler,2012-04-09 12:48:00,5204,"Great read Ricardo!  Where the hell is Harvey?  Anyhoo, sounds like a blast...shame i missed it cuz of work.  Thanks for the fishy porn......they certainly grow big and plenty full in the river...you is lucky boy being able o cast for those guys from your porch!  If you get a small boat at all the next few weeks we will have to meet up for crappy and/or some laker action half way or down your neck of the woods....sound good?"
685122,manitoubass2,2012-04-09 16:58:00,11391," Harv actually had a hard time finding a babysitter, so he showed up to the derby about an hour late. He hopped in with someone with room, and in true Harvey fashion, had a good 6lber about 5 minutes into fishing, lol.  I thank god everyday I have this river, lol. Having the opportunity to fish right out your front door sure makes it alot easier then packing up the boat all the time, lol.  We def. have to plan something out. I'm gonna be fishing up the 502 alot this year, I've been scouting maps all winter, lol. Just let me know when and where and we'll try and make it happen.  Sometime this summer I wanna go way way  up cedar narrows for a weekend camp. Just bring a 16ft tinny and a trolling motor. So many good lakes up there."
685164,johnnyb,2012-04-09 18:47:00,3413,"Nice work, MB!  11oz out of the lead, what place did you finish?"
685171,manitoubass2,2012-04-09 19:08:00,11391," Thanks! We finished in second.  All the other boats couldn't find active fish for the most part. Us and one other boat fished a shallow sandbar and it produced. The other boats were mainly in what we call ""sturgeon alley"", a main channel funnel where the sturgeon seem to travel. But there not locals so maybe they weren't aware of that???  A few sturgeon made an appearance for a couple of the anglers, pretty funny to see on light spinning set ups.     "
685190,johnnyb,2012-04-09 20:32:00,3413,2nd place is pretty good for your first tournament -- keep it up!  
685211,manitoubass2,2012-04-09 21:58:00,11391," Many thanks, but it was just a derby, lol, I've won a few of those already.  I have a feeling the tournys will be much more difficult and I'll be humbled .  Gonna be alot of fun though   "
685244,Christopheraaron,2012-04-09 23:09:00,3525,"Nice fish there, even if you didn't win you can be proud to catch those fish, I have my first toury this july im getting in it pretty late in the season i know but i dont have the funds to go for the big events yet so i had to wait for a lower priced event to come up."
