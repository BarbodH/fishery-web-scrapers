685168,young_one,2012-04-09 19:05:00,620,Does that mean four years from now we'll receive an exceptional run? Consider the spawning run start from age 4-10.
685174,chessy,2012-04-09 19:22:00,610,we are on a high right now from a wet summer 3 and 4 years ago... seing this year so far has been dry with no snow.. the river cant get any lower so i would hope it will be better come 3 and 4 years from now .. one can only hope
685600,ecmilley,2012-04-11 11:15:00,2163,"i seem to remember runs of 18000 from years ago, wonder if we'll ever see that again"
685603,Garnet,2012-04-11 11:51:00,2056,"The huge runs of the 80's were a product of 100 year flood leaving every square inch prime spawning habitat.  All the rivers silted back in and spawning production decline.  It's great to get the fish up early and back to the lake, the bad part for all the rivers is no huge blow out to clean some silt."
