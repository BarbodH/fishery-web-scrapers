685430,Basskicker,2012-04-10 17:47:00,421,"It's up to 149.9 up here in Manitouwadge...crazy.  I try to visit the nearest Indian reserve where it's only 133.9 without my discount.  Filled up 124/L for $167.00....ouch, but saved nearly $45-50 by going to the reserve.  Going to be using the canoe or 14ft/9.9HP a lot more this year, instead of the bass boat.  The ice finally left the lake here in town on Sunday  Jason"
685432,mike rousseau,2012-04-10 18:02:00,4661, my math says you saved $19.84...   i get 150 liters give or take at $4.05 or $1.06 a liter on the rez here right now...so...$159.00... in ontario its $1.36 a liter...so...$204.00...  thats $45 in savings...minus 5 for bridge toll... so $40 savings for a 30 minute trip across the border... like 5km each way... tops...
685433,aplumma,2012-04-10 18:06:00,6896,You don't even want to know my fuel bill lol. The big boat runs (2) 318 ci motors for a 1.5 GPM the Rangers 150 gets 2 MPG and the 40 Jet gets 3 MPG. I don't think I will change the way I fish... it is just the price you pay to have fun.   Art
685439,mike rousseau,2012-04-10 18:29:00,4661,not sure what my 40 honda is in mpg numbers...  if i drive straight from one side of my milk run to the other and back its 30 miles and 2+ miles across... and then add all the back and forth driving at each spot and trolling miles... a FULL day...10+hours...covering every section of that area... is usually 30 bucks...
685458,craigdritchie,2012-04-10 20:00:00,1586,"This is precisely why bass boat sales have been declining for years. Market (in southern Canada and northeast US, at least) is definitely swinging to aluminum 16- 18 foot with 70hp - 115hp engines."

684366,kickingfrog,2012-04-06 17:59:00,8333,"Some people will do crazy things to ""save"" on gas. People will drive across town or out of town to save 2 tenths of a cent on a fill up.  On a 50 litre fill up that is a difference of a dime. Even for a cent per litre difference the same fill up is 50 cents.  I'm not loaded by any means but I'm not going to work too hard to save 4 bits on a $67 stop for gas.  I can likely save 10 times that much by being more efficient in my driving habits....especially if I can get a few cars out of the middle lane."
684384,mercman,2012-04-06 18:34:00,7054,"149.9 a litre this morning. 147.9 now. It wont affect the use of my boat, it will affect how far i tow it though."

684423,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-06 23:08:00,10439,Price of gas in Leduc Alberta this morning was $1.169/L. Seems pretty cheap these days. Price of fuel here in Yellowknife is unchanged @ $1.389/L which is where it has been for nearly a year.

684436,bigugli,2012-04-07 00:25:00,6138,I just have to plan my outings more carefully.
684437,MCTFisher9120,2012-04-07 00:29:00,3761,Last summer I ran a 7.5hp for 3 weeks non stop on the camping trip I take out to my grandmas neck of the woods..I spent $300 on gas during that trip. This year I'll be running a 9.9 or 15hp engine for 2 weeks time...probably going to need about 4 or 5 hundred for the gas fund it looks like
684640,Dabluz,2012-04-07 21:52:00,701,  300 dollars for gas for the 7.5 ???  Wow....I think I filled my gas can about 4 times last year and I went fishing 3 or 4 times per week.  My longest run is about 15 minutes.
684650,MCTFisher9120,2012-04-07 22:39:00,3761," Fishing in the morning then coming back for lunch then going out right after until dinner then going out again for the 2 or 3 hours after 6pm every day for 3 weeks straight. It's a lot of gas. My run to the next lake was about 20minutes, not bad for a 7.5hp. I can get anywhere on the home lake in a 2min run across but I ventured to new water with the engine so always had to make a drive, but did stay on the home lake too lots.  Anyway don't know how but I did it, thats a rough estimate, I filled up a 5Gallon plastic jug 3 or 5gal gas tank and a 1g about 3 or 4 times during the trip."
684671,jedimaster,2012-04-08 00:34:00,3472,Gonna be riding the bike to work. I have a short commute but 80km's per week in the jeep is still gonna save me more than I spend in my lund with a 30 yam.
684681,Freshtrax,2012-04-08 02:19:00,2215,I'm putting a hitch on the carrola
684715,RSF,2012-04-08 12:02:00,47,"Went to a smaller boat w/a merc 9.9. But purchased a 50 lb thrust electric and good deep cycle battery so I'll be using it quite alot this summer. Intend to patch in a minimum, 90 watt 7 amp solar panel for next year, using the merc to travel and the electric to troll. A little surprised to read three weeks on 7.5 costs 300.00? That's a hundred a week or what.. a 6 gallon tank a day roughly?"
684721,MCTFisher9120,2012-04-08 12:36:00,3761," No, not 6 Gallons daily. I burned a easy 1.5 to 2 gallons a day. Driving time with a little engine sucked, but I enjoyed every second. With 15hp on a 14' boat I'll be able to make the run in 15 minutes to the next lake over. The main thing was that in the channel were weeds, most engines can idle through no problem or fly through no problem. My boat was short and heavy so it put off a good wave and loved the weeds. Had to go slow and probably why I ate up lot's of gas. a 20min drive to your spot and a 20min ride home was the average. I always stopped and fished a spot or two on the way there and fished 2 or three spots after each outing before returning home for a meal.  I'm not sure but I must of put a good hour each day on the engine in running time, maybe 15minutes more if you count a warm up in the morning each day.  Two 5 Gallon jugs and a 1 Gallon jug was the fill up every 5-6 days. At 71 Liters per full up and at a 1.20 range it adds up quick my friend at $85 per fill up times that by 4 fill ups and I've breached $300 and that was my guess on spending. Put $1.40 in place now it's $100 per fill up on my camping trip.  Hopefully with a 15 or 9.9 I won't get bogged down in weeds and can travel quicker like the others through the channels etc. With a little more hp and travel distance as more power gets u more water to fish the math seems right ish"
685332,RSF,2012-04-10 03:48:00,47," Used a 40 Merc for years on various lakes and I was quite surprised how good it was on gas, small boat though (Fibre -14'). Always backed-off the power after getting on plane which made a pretty-big difference.  I had all kinds of weed problems on Georgion Bay and Pigeon Lake.  Managed to solve that problem for the next season, sharpening the prop and it worked well. Just purchased a merc 9.9 for the new boat, Seamax 14' Inflatable. Told performance v gas usage should be very good, I would think that may be due to the boat being light weight compared to fibre glass?, we'll see."
685357,bigbuck,2012-04-10 12:59:00,2449,"Its expensive this year!! At a 1.30/l for my boat will be around 160+ to fill. That's pump gas, not marina fuel. Marinas will be around 1.50 or so per litre. I will definitely go easier on the throttle this year."

I just filled up for $1.36 (Etobicoke)... not sure where all the media-hype is coming from ... or maybe we just havent seen it yet ... but it seems to me a few years ago we saw a 10 - 15 cent swing almost every Friday ... and while we all complained about it , there were MUCH bigger problems for millions of people (just ask all the folks who's houses were suddenly 'under water' and couldnt get their mortgages renewed).  On a completely different note I really am struggling to understand the rationale of sitting in line for 2 hours (as the media said thousands did the other day) to save $8 or $10 before the big price increase ... I'd think that if the price is going up anyway then its really only a one-time saving on your first tank of gas... and surely everyone's time is worth more than $4 or $5 /hour (that's less than minimum wage)... am I missing something here ?"
