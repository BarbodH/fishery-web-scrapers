685256,richyb,2012-04-10 00:08:00,774,Im looking for a battery for my 2006 arctic cat 400. Crappy tire has them for $72 but I figured I would ask around before I drop the coin on that one. Thanks.

685415,ch312,2012-04-10 16:43:00,1590,"keep in mind that batteries are just like everything else in that you get what you pay for and opting for the cheapest brand often results in cursing, swearing, and headaches in the future. but, i guess it's not really an issue if you have a pull start on your ATV.  buy and use a battery tender. they keep your battery in optimal condition and can even bring bad batteries back to life. i believe the JR model is less than $40 and is money very well spent."
685416,richyb,2012-04-10 16:46:00,774,Thanks guys . Total battery was actually more money than crappy tire so I think I will just get that one.
685419,Rattletrap2,2012-04-10 16:50:00,1652, I'll second the vote for Total Battery in Barrie. They have excellent prices and great service!
