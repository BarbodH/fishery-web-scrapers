685503,babaganoush,2012-04-10 23:21:00,105,Planning on getting a Calcutta te dc to start float fishing but was wondering in the colder months will the spool freeze up a little and stop it from free spooling. Would like some input on this before I go pick up the reel
685512,krixxer,2012-04-10 23:48:00,274,All about line selection. Power pro will not free spool for me in sub zero.

685521,Dave Jones,2012-04-11 00:32:00,50,I have never had a problem with freeze up at the reel. Freeze up at the guides is another matter. Stick with mono as stated above.
685548,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-11 01:34:00,0,braid would make for a bummer of a day in anything cold for sure.  hahaha. stick with a high quality monofilament like siglon v and you'll have no trouble with a baitcaster as long as you're not fishing ditches.
