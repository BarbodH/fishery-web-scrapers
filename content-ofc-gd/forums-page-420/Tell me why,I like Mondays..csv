685612,misfish,2012-04-11 12:20:00,29133, Next weekend. Tanks me brudder.
685614,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-11 12:29:00,310,Now that's a great reason to love Mondays for sure. Nice fish.
685659,Spiel,2012-04-11 14:28:00,9065," You mean the weekend after this weekend or this weekend cause this weekend is the ""next weekend.""  "
685142,misfish,2012-04-09 17:53:00,29133,"First off to those it may concern,there are no back ground shots.  So why do I like Mondays,,,,,,,,,,,,  You get about 10 miles of winding river to yourself.  Not the bestest day for catching,but there was some catching done.Of many sorts I must add.LOL  We had some rain last night(one good down pour) and was not sure how far south this storm started,  so check the updated chart this morning and it was perfect.Slight rise.  I parked the truck at 6am and make the trek. Boy was the wind  kicking this morning,trees making lots of cricking and cracking.Even though it was +3,it felt like -8 at times.  My walk was greeted by two nice deer that I spooked. There was lots of drumming going on by the male grouse in the area.There was one that so loud,you would think he was right in front of you.Beautiful sound.  Anyhoo,get to the water and start fishing.Two or three drifts in, I get hit and it,s a little wee fella.Quickly in and let go.New bait hooked up,and again,I get hit.Another wee fella.I like to get hits,but getting around 14 of these little guys,sure makes my roe tying time not really rewarding.LOL  They sure were aggressive this morning.It a great sign though for this river.  Hungery little fella aint he,,,,I thought the eye was really cool.Shaped like a tear drop.    It was time to move on,I had enough fun with them. During my walks from spot to spot,I looked for any sign of fiddle head growth. It,s not even close as you can see.    I got to my second last spot and looked real nice.Some fast moving water with frog water deep pool.Took a few drifts,then it happen,,,,,,,,,Yep,snagged.I give the ole heave hoe and it come out.Love my 8pd Maxima. Low and behold,I get to add to my hook and bait count.LOL  Pay no mind to the colour of that mess,it dosent work.    So check for and abbrassion in the line,all good to go,except had to replace the bent out hook. Get all tied up and make a drift.  Now this is one crazy happing.I tossed the float out,it starts it,s drift, when all of a sudden this gust of wind lifts my line and the float is starting to lift off the water   . Just as the float starts to rise up,wham, down goes the float and the fight is on.That was so frigg,n cool. Took a few minutes to get her under control,lots of leeping/runs.Was awesome to watch. I have been getting use to bigger fish,(ya know, shes not what many would call big)but she had a fight in her.She had done her duty up river   and guess she,ll be back in the main lake very soon.  I used my cell for this pic,it was handy,and wanted to get her back in fast.    The last spot didnt produce,so made my way back to the truck.  I came accross this pretty cool tree formation laced with green growth.Thought how it would make a cool rod holder.    Well till next time. Thanks for reading."

685180,Fisherman,2012-04-09 19:51:00,7201,"Still a bit early for the fiddlers, I'm thinking maybe towards the end of this week if it warms up.  I also want to look for wild garlic around the same area, ,maybe get lucky."
