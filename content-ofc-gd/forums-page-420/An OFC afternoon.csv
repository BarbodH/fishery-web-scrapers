Some current members and some from the past, many of you long time members and Lakair gatherers will remember their names and faces.  From left to right, Tybo, my sweetie Julie and and Deg (Don).     Again from left to right.....  Roy, Joey, Ruth (Don's wife) and my good friend Fish Farmer.    Lots of laughs and a few beers too.....  I hope you get your first Brown Trout today Roy.  My thanks to all of you for your company, it was absolutely wonderful to see you all again!"

684707,Gerritt,2012-04-08 10:49:00,6129,Paul smoking in the house?!?  Wow! you must have been in a good mood Spiel  G
684710,Spiel,2012-04-08 11:31:00,9065,"  No not that bright Jacques but without them Roy wouldn't find his beer.    18 years under USS will be hell for sure Phil. As for Dave, surprised me too that he wasn't out fishing.    Don't blame the Post office Terry, I forgot to mail them.    They come round couple times a year Mike, always a pleasure to see them.   I think he was talking about the fish he almost caught!   Don't get any ideas Mr.   "
684711,ChrisK,2012-04-08 11:32:00,2772,Sorry I couldn't make it Spiel. Looks like everyone was having a great time.
684753,Fish Farmer,2012-04-08 14:30:00,2234,Thanks Chris for the invite. Was a real pleasure meeting everyone. I had a great time. I could have chatted all afternoon. I hope Roy caught his PB Brown Trout.
684754,Spiel,2012-04-08 14:34:00,9065, I won't say too much but I did talk to him this morning and he was a happy guy.
684756,Fish Farmer,2012-04-08 14:38:00,2234,"As long as the conversation with great friends consists of fishing Phil, I get the same fishin feelin. Thats not saying I wasn't going the next day  I just finished filleting my Perch catch from Pt. Abino from yesterday, having them for super tonight"
684759,Fish Farmer,2012-04-08 14:47:00,2234,"Good for him Chris, can't wait to see their fishin report when they get back"
684764,mercman,2012-04-08 14:59:00,7054,"This is the root reason for the success of this great Community. Friends becoming familly, and famillies becoming friends. Thanks for sharing this moment with us Chris, there was alot of OFC history at that table.  Thanks and Happy Easter"
684774,fishnsled,2012-04-08 15:14:00,3520,Good friends and good times. Missed turn to your place and ended up fishing Dunnville instead. Oh well.....
684779,Spiel,2012-04-08 15:36:00,9065," Dang Will, should dropped in on your way back!  Hope you had a good day, looking for a report....."
684780,pics,2012-04-08 15:57:00,1268,The big west wind is coming in just in time for my days off.....I guess I'll hvae to sit and talk about fishin like you guys did.....lol
684781,fishnsled,2012-04-08 15:58:00,3520,"  Probably should have Chris, just was getting late and Cliff and I we're pretty burned out. Cliff is working on the report and should have it together in the next day or two. A bit of a slow day but 4 cats in the boat. We seemed to do better then the others that Steve (Fishmaster) knew. One of the advantages of having a good guide on a tough day."
684900,ccmtcanada,2012-04-08 22:23:00,7971,"Looks like a great mini get together!  Yep, Will and I were close to you, but we had to pass through Hamilton.  Just rendering video for the report now...had a great day in Dunnville!"
684924,solopaddler,2012-04-08 23:30:00,8605,    Well it sucked on Friday LOL!  Glad to hear you guys did a little better.
