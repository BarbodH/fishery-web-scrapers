684564,Woodsman,2012-04-07 15:40:00,1286,Can you define decent prices. With meal plans the price will jump quickly. $2000 - $2400 dollars for a week for 3 with meal a plan may be a decent price to some but not to others. House keeping (cook your own meals) will keep costs down & open up many more options. Finding a place (first week of Aug) may also be somewhat limited due to a lot of the better places may already be booked.
684571,esoxcrazy,2012-04-07 16:44:00,22,www.sandbeachlodge.com  I believe we have everything you are looking for.  Only a 3-3.5 hr drive on mostly 4 lanes and very quiet river as majority of the shoreline is provincial park.
