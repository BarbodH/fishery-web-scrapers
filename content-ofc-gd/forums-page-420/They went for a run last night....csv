685356,Nipfisher,2012-04-10 12:57:00,2449,"Good job Ryan, I am going tonight."
685360,Fish Farmer,2012-04-10 13:03:00,2234,"Hamilton Pier or would that be farther north. I'm looking for a feed. Thats just a nice feed, congrats."
685362,Lip-ripper,2012-04-10 13:10:00,228," Nope, got these up near North Bay. I suspect they would have ran a while ago down south..."
685363,BillM,2012-04-10 13:11:00,17367,So many possible world records in that bucket!   I hope you feed some of them to spring pike
685368,Fish Farmer,2012-04-10 13:28:00,2234,"Thanks for the info. Down here in Lake Ont. they don't generally start running till the middle of April, Could be a little earlier this year because of the weather we've been having. I may give it a go tonight."
685379,Rod Caster,2012-04-10 14:16:00,5784,"Of course the one day they run hard, is the day I have to sleep early for a morning meeting  This years smelting season is stressing me out haha.  "
685383,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-10 14:27:00,0,i had a lovely feed last night and i didn't even have to go out to get it.  that's my favourite.  i don't mind smelting but i still have nightmares about cleaning them for 4 hours in my grandmothers basement hungover.  hahahaha
685384,Lip-ripper,2012-04-10 14:35:00,228," That's what after dinner naps are for! I had a 2 hour nap then headed out just after 10. Actually felt pretty decent this morning considering I've been out 4 times in the last week waiting for the run. Frustrating year for sure.   I've noticed that alot of people want ""Just a feed"" when they hear that you got some, yet they aren't around when you are out till the wee hours netting them, or during the hellish hours of cleaning them. I'll be cleaning these up tonite. Hopefully I get it done in under 4 hours!"
685393,Rod Caster,2012-04-10 15:05:00,5784,"  Someone on another board posted that they freeze them whole and clean them as they need.... that's what I'll be doing from now on, unless I'm smelting on a friday or saturday."
685635,Nipfisher,2012-04-11 13:10:00,2449,"Got out for a Smelting last night with Rod Caster and a buddy. Tried our private creek for some bigg-uns and we were not dissapointed. My biggest was just ove 9""! Our buddy caught one even bigger! Ended the night with about 150 to take home and certainly could have got more but 2am is too late for this guy lol.  I'm done for this season.     "
685636,Lip-ripper,2012-04-11 13:15:00,228,"Nice Blair! Glad you got some. I cleaned the buggers for around 3 hours yesterday evening. Ended up with 8 bags of 35-40, and a bunch more that I left uncleaned. Messy, stinky job..."
685637,Rod Caster,2012-04-11 13:23:00,5784,That big one buddy got was just silly... It was like netting a whitefish! Easily 10 inches long. I just bagged mine whole... I'll see how that works. I have lots of snacks and a few bags of pike bait! Good times.
685677,Nipfisher,2012-04-11 15:13:00,2449,I ended up cleaning my whole lot. 145 in total. I made 5 bags of 26 for the freezer and friends and have 15 in the sink for breakfast in a little bit.
