685133,Joey,2012-04-09 17:19:00,9122,"So we have been trying to have the stars align and get Roy down to Niagara with us for some time now and the stars finally aligned this weekend.  This was also the first test drive with our new puppy Ralphie in the boat too.  The two Frenchies behaved themselves very well  Roy arrived at our place Thursday late and we had a good gab session and then hit the hay sometime around 1 a.m.  Got up Good Friday and packed the truck and off we went.  As most have already read, we stopped at Spiel's house first on the way down for a visit and he graciously picked us up some roe and minnows at Fishing World as from previous years' experience showed us, they are not open Good Friday.  We arrived there about 1 or 2 ish and Spiel and Julie had a nice spread of fresh veggies and some meats and dip.  Just what we needed to keep our strength up for the long weekend.  Thanks so very much Chris and Julie, for getting the bait and the munchies and the great company.  Dave (Fishfarmer) was there, and Don and Ruth came by to say hello aswell     Nice seeing you guys, it has been a long time.  So after that nice visit, we headed off to the Inn for some relaxation before the weekend of fishing.  The dog and the other frenchie fell asleep after Spiel's and woke up just as we arrived      We got a nice room and unpacked and relaxed for the evening.  We were going to order in but apparently there is no delivery there so we ordered some great food from the Old Firehall Restaurant just down the street and picked it up.  Good stuff.  Then got a good night's sleep ready for a day of fishing.  Couple shots from the night.                Ralphie just LOVED this fireplace and parked his behind there most of the time    The weather was great.  A bit chilly in the morning but I was able to strip down to just a sweatshirt by mid morning.  Water was clear and we did the drift for several hours before Ralphie pooped out and the guys dropped me off at the dock so I could walk back to the Inn and have a snooze with Ralphie     They continued to fish the rest of the afternoon but there were no takers.                Sunday the guys got up bright and ugly and headed out for another fish.  I opted to sleep in with the dog and dreamt of catching fish     They didn't bring a watch with them and I was surprised to see them at 9 a.m. back at the Inn.  Check out is at 11 and they figured for sure it was 11 and were disappointed they could have fished for two more hours.  Anyhow, Roy managed to catch a nice rainbow and that's what our mission was all about.  We packed up and headed home for some take out Chinese food and a good snooze.  Roy left this morning for the long drive back to Quebec.      It was great having you with us this weekend hun and I'm so glad you finally caught a Niagara Bow     Hope you had a safe drive this morning and can't wait to do this again.  Cheers all,  Joey"

685194,Roy,2012-04-09 20:44:00,13728,"Personally, I don't care what they call it but it IS an engine.  I had a fantastic time, a wonderful drive up and back and in between the two drives, met and re-met some great friends. Paul, Joey, Spiel, Julie, Don, Ruth and Dave are all people that I would like to see more often but, we do what we can. A 3-way swivel, No.6 walleye hook with a small chartreuse roe sac and a 1oz pencil weight did the job and Paul kept me over the fish. I was really surprised at the acrobatic antics of these fish.  Thank you everyone."

I wouldn't have minded giving you some info. It was a tough bite, especially on the ON side. We didn't get one bite on the ON side, and we tried."

I used to go golfing down that way and ended off the day with dinner there many a time. Roy, nice Bow bud!!"
