685843,jedimaster,2012-04-12 01:44:00,3472,I was thinking deep caught perch as well. Were these from Lake E? I haven't seen such a big haul like that anywhere.
685871,crappieperchhunter,2012-04-12 03:56:00,2582,I don't think you will find deep perch this time of year...they are up shallow for the spawn.We have been catching them on Simcoe for almost a month now in under 10 FOW...lotsa quality fish like in the picture from shore too. I don't fish Erie so I could be way out of line. But I can't see the pattern being that different.
685872,manitoubass2,2012-04-12 04:04:00,11391,Oh my good gawd!!!!!!  I dont even know what else to say..........  
685893,Court R,2012-04-12 12:19:00,213,Yes these are Lake Erie fish.. been catching fish in up to 70fow.
685899,Billy Bob,2012-04-12 12:38:00,5865," Two reasons I wouldn't release these Lake Erie Jumbo's......  1) they are coming from deep water and survival rate is not very good good....  2) if released and they do survive, chances are they could be caught by the commercial fishermen, using gill nets."
686115,Fish Farmer,2012-04-13 02:07:00,2234,"Was out there today, 2 guys, and limited out 64FTW in-front of Sherkston. Move till you find them. We launched at Crystal Beach"
686119,kickingfrog,2012-04-13 02:14:00,8333,Look close. The guy with the red hoody has an air hose over his shoulder.
686155,Billy Bob,2012-04-13 09:16:00,5865, Gotcha......was planning for this weekend but it don't look good weather wise.....I usually launch right across from you off the Catt....Sturgeon Point is close right now from what I hear (dredging)....  When I was younger I use to launch a couple time a week at Crystal Beach and fish the sail boats for smallies.....I heard they charge at that launch now.....
686178,Fish Farmer,2012-04-13 12:35:00,2234,"Your right Bob,I read the sign yesterday, Starting May 1st till Sept. $5.00 to launch. It's free right now. Crystal beach has a great launch with paved parking lot and excellent docks."
686193,Billy Bob,2012-04-13 13:41:00,5865," Back in the late 70's and early 80's it was just a small concrete launch on the east side with a almost all stone launch on the south side while the parking lot was all rocks and stone....no docks anywhere....but I was OK with that as the price was right (FREE) and it kept out most of the boaters from using it...  My bother in-law still goes there once in a while....if I remember correctly he said it has a gate or something that you must pre-pay to use the launch or you could get a ticket....but if it's only $5, then that's a steal as we are paying $7 - $9 per launch here....and believe me...that bothers the heck out of me...those launches should be FREE..."
685618,Court R,2012-04-11 12:38:00,213,Had a chance to get out on the lake last week with a buddy and they were on fire!   
685620,NAW,2012-04-11 12:40:00,4022,Oh my GOD.  That's insane.  Great job!!!
685621,Grimace,2012-04-11 12:40:00,2020,That is a thing of beauty.  There are some real tanks in there.
685622,fishindevil,2012-04-11 12:47:00,6254,some huge perch there boys well done !!!
685623,crappieperchhunter,2012-04-11 12:50:00,2582,Congrats on a good outing  Lotsa good eats there for a bunch of fish fries. I had last week off for vacation so I have a bunch of those packaged up in my freezer now too. My favourite fresh water fish to eat.
685624,mercman,2012-04-11 12:50:00,7054,Holy Cow !!!!! You sure they arent breeding with Bass ??!!! Great eats there.
685625,johnnyb,2012-04-11 12:51:00,3413,That is a serious HAUL!
685626,Nipfisher,2012-04-11 12:53:00,2449,PIGS! Huge bellies on them perchies.
685627,oldphart,2012-04-11 12:55:00,665,"~~~~Fantastic haul bud, I was no where near those size or numbers, maybe if  staple mind together, would be close"
685629,Fish Farmer,2012-04-11 13:00:00,2234,"Nice catch, did you check the measurements on that fish on the right? That thing looks huge. We just had one come into our club that was 16""X11"""
685631,Lunkerhunter,2012-04-11 13:01:00,455,nice haul! how big was the biggest one? looks huge
685638,beginner,2012-04-11 13:23:00,542,"your kitchen looks like fish market, awesome!.. definitely nice feed for the family... thanks for sharin"
685640,woodenboater,2012-04-11 13:31:00,2277,"that is one humongous belly in the first photo. hell they're all fat my mom hates me, going to taste mighty fine"
685642,Court R,2012-04-11 13:33:00,213,"There were a couple 15""ers but didn't check the girth."
685662,Walleye'm Fishing,2012-04-11 14:33:00,310,Holy haul. Some seriously obese perch right there!!!
685667,jedimaster,2012-04-11 14:41:00,3472,HOLY CRAAAPPPP!!!!! Where you guys fishing by the Darlington Power plant or what?
685690,Aaron Shirley,2012-04-11 16:38:00,655,"Great fish Court! Looks like you and Chuck splayed 'em. That one looks like it,s going to explode!"
685696,ch312,2012-04-11 17:00:00,1590,"i guess i'm the only one that doesn't like seeing females sitting on a counter top that are so full of eggs they're about to explode. the catching was obviously good, why not release the big spawners and stick to keeping eaters? there's a reason jumbo's are getting harder and harder to find...  that said, nice haul"
685724,Joeytier,2012-04-11 19:43:00,3990,Hey look!  A fishing report!  Awesome fish guys.
685725,lovetofish,2012-04-11 19:46:00,500,Wow!  Great Job!
685749,captpierre,2012-04-11 20:57:00,2521,Can't argue with that
685761,misfish,2012-04-11 21:19:00,29133,"  Well not really ch312. I would sooner fillet a bunch of well fed males(although you got to deal with the goop from them) That said,nice haul and big fish guys."
685786,dave524,2012-04-11 22:42:00,4508,"Thems are what my dad used to refer to as ""sowbellies"" nice haul. If they came from where I assume they are pretty much unreleaseable, what the pics don't show would be the swim bladders in their mouths. Also ,I fished Erie from the late 50's till now, 60's it was in decline, 70's it was dead, rebirth in the 80's, pretty much the fishing has never been better than now in my lifetime on Erie, don't sweat the sport angler keeping a few fish on Erie, the gill netters don't practice catch and release either."
685822,Rizzo,2012-04-12 00:19:00,4754,"WOW, did you inflate those to 40 p.s.i? some look ready to blow!"
685841,BillM,2012-04-12 01:32:00,17367,Those are some cows!
