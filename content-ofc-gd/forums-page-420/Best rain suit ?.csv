I have been using a ""make it work"" suit for the last two years and its not 100% effective. I want to stay dry while fishing going forward haha  I'm just starting my hunt so I was just looking for some opinions on some of the suits available. I'm looking at possibly Shimano, BPS, Cabelas, or Frabill... Gortex is a must and I want to add a liner for fall if possible.  Is there anything in particular I should be looking for ??  TIA"
685643,fish_fishburn,2012-04-11 13:37:00,1311,"I would look at the Arcteryx line which I am using now and am very pleased with. Also Helly Hansen makes good gear, that is specifically designed for sailing and boating."
685645,carll2,2012-04-11 13:55:00,443,i really like my simms pro dry gore tex
685647,mbac31,2012-04-11 14:00:00,904,"Simms, Frabill and Gill. Gill being the best out there so far now hands down."
685648,whiskywizard,2012-04-11 14:03:00,305,"Mountain Equipment Coop (MEC) is another place to look, if you want really high-performance stuff, much like the Arc'teryx gear mentioned previously. But like Arc'teryx, MEC gear is pricey. You can easily be >$500 for jacket and pant.  I think one of the best bang-for-your-buck suits is the Bass Pro Shops Pro Qualifier suit. And it's on sale right now."

685665,hirk,2012-04-11 14:38:00,571,Pro quaifier has a zip in liner for cold weather too as a add on
685672,4x4bassin,2012-04-11 14:52:00,1025,"With out a doubt spend the money and get a good goretex suit , you won't regret it ! I was able to get in on the great cabela's guidewear deal from last fall thanks to a few guys on this board    and I used it once with no problems.I didn't get the liner for it instead opting for a bigger size and wearing a light/heavy fleece under it to match conditions ! For a good suit you will probably be looking at minimum $450-$500 bucks but keep your eyes open for some deals , they do come around once and awhile ! Good luck"
685678,tonyb,2012-04-11 15:36:00,1637,"I love my Cabelas Goretex Guidewear suit, and it appears they've redesigned them recently after listening to input from anglers.  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Clothing/Mens-Casual-Clothing/Mens-Fishing-Clothing/Mens-Fishing-Clothing-Outerwear%7C/pc/104797080/c/104746680/sc/104329080/i/104170680/Cabelas-GORE-TEX-Guidewear-Parka-150-Regular/1316554.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Fclothing-mens-casual-clothing-mens-fishing-clothing-mens-fishing-clothing-outerwear%2F_%2FN-1102594%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_104170680%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104793480%253Bcat104329080&WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104793480%3Bcat104329080%3Bcat104170680"
685681,mike rousseau,2012-04-11 15:48:00,4661,"I love my cabelas guidewear.... I've been out In some of the nastiest weather fishable and was bone dry(except my face...the only exposed skin...)  I does not have a ""removable"" liner option.... But I layer up underneath the the suit and do just fine...  I have non insulated and wore it most of the winter ice fishing....as well as some winter days in the boat...you just need good layers underneath..."
685687,NANUK,2012-04-11 16:02:00,797,Another vote for Cabela's Guidewear gore tex rain suite.
685691,troutologist,2012-04-11 16:40:00,951,The Simms Pro Dry is an amazing suit.  I have the old Cabelas Guidewear and the only complaint is the leak at the bottom of the zipper when sitting.  Arc'teryx and MEC both have some really nice stuff that I wear for work. But I like the increased pockets/storage of the fishing dedicated suits.   Don't worry about a zip in liner or insulation. Get a bigger shell and pick up good layers (MEC)
685695,Tybo,2012-04-11 16:57:00,1373,"Carhartt pvc .50mm C64 coat and R39 bibs.Been uses them at work.Best suit out there. diesel,hydraulic,tranny and engine oil.It`s been covered in them all and keeps going."
685698,adempsey,2012-04-11 17:20:00,1498,"Salus Marine is another company you can check out.  I also purchased the Cabelas Guidewear last winter since it was such a great price, but haven't used it yet so cannot comment - you'll will find a ton of great reviews though.  I think any of the aforementioned brands make good rain gear and wouldn't hesitate to buy any of them.  If it were me, the main factors would be price and warranty - not the specific brand.  For example, BPS typically has an excellent warranty on their products, but I couldn't find the info on the rain suit."
685699,Cosmos,2012-04-11 17:24:00,588,  Best suit I ever had.
685704,kickingfrog,2012-04-11 18:05:00,8333,"Note to self: don't lend tybo my rain suit.  I really like the cabelas guide suit. They were on sale last fall. Quite a few of us here took advantage. I think I saved about $150, got a free tackle bag $60 value, and then when the price dropped and I asked, they sent me a $50 (maybe $75) credit."
685709,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2012-04-11 18:22:00,0,"i like anything made from goretex and prefer cabelas price over the ridiculous money charged by companies like simms... i mean, who needs a 600 dollar rain coat?"
685791,carll2,2012-04-11 22:57:00,443,"  me   when you can pick up bibs/jacket for half price its well worth it.. this year i am trying cabelas as my back up suit, cant wait to see if this sitting zipper leaking issue has been solved?? i spend 70% of my day sitting trolling on ol bear!"
685937,mike rousseau,2012-04-12 15:41:00,4661,  Where is your zipper leaking?  I'm a sit down troller and haven't had this problem with my cabelas guidewear I bought last year...
685938,troutologist,2012-04-12 16:05:00,951,  The bibs traditionally leaked at the bottom about right to make you look like you had bladder issues when back on shore.
685941,Harrison,2012-04-12 16:08:00,2202,"Frogg toggs.  Under rated rain gear, check them out, may be pleasently suprised for the moola."
685971,uglyfish,2012-04-12 19:00:00,981,"I have the BPS pro qualifier! Best money I've ever spent. Comfortable to wear, keeps u dry. And the liner u can buy is also great for cooler or windier days."
686036,carll2,2012-04-12 22:57:00,443,"  its not my suit but a buddie that has his that i guide with, hes not sure where its leaking from but he would finish his rainy fishing days with his crotch all wet.."
