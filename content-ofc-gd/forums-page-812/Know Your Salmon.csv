365414,Bob,2009-07-23 13:59:00,370,Pinook! That's my final answer and I don't want to call a friend.
365434,Joey,2009-07-23 14:30:00,9122,Is it a King Salmon?
365440,kemper,2009-07-23 14:47:00,2232,looks like a coho to me but that would be too easy...
365444,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-23 14:50:00,10439,"Looks like a sockeye to me. A fresh one, not like the tomatoes that are around when I'm fishing in September."
365457,Guest gbfisher,2009-07-23 15:37:00,0,I think Drifter has it....It isnt an Atlantic like the one I caught yeterday out on Lake 'O' thats for sure...
365461,marth11,2009-07-23 15:43:00,60,if i knew were it was caught it could be easier to tell but my guess is either a kokanee or maybe grilse
365462,craigdritchie,2009-07-23 15:45:00,1586,"MJL ... YOU DA MAN!!!  Folks, we have a winner - the fish is indeed a cherry salmon, also known as Oncorhynchus masou. They're only found in northern Japan, Korea and the extreme south-east part of Russia, where they occupy the same ecological niche as our North American coho. I said this was a tough one. Unless you've ever been lucky enough to fish in Japan or Korea, you've never seen one of these fish, so it doesn't come any tougher than that!  As per everyone's different responses, cherry salmon do look a whole lot like a coho and a little bit like a chinook, but they have a completely unique spotting pattern. I'm told their spawning colours are stunning ..... black backs and cherry red sides (hence their name), but with dark vertical blotches all over (kind of like a spawning chum salmon). The males apparently get big hooked snouts like sockeyes, and have teeth like a Doberman.  I've never even seen a cherry salmon, much less caught one, but I hope to change that when I go to Korea for a short business trip this fall. I'm told they're a lot like coho -- 6 to 10 pounds on average, crazy aggressive, jump when hooked and make long, powerful runs. Should be an absolute blast on a centerpin.  That was fun everyone  .... thanks for playing along.  How about another? Anyone have an even tougher one?"
365464,camillj,2009-07-23 15:46:00,1988,  I agree 100% ... I will be fishin the Credit this fall for sure ...right through till Christmas !!! .. I love river run Coho (and I feel good eating them) ...just  can't bring myself to even come look at the river run Chinny ... lets hope this Coho move catches on again .. it was such a wonderful fishery in the early eighties ... and bountiful and fun to fish for !
365482,Jonny,2009-07-23 16:22:00,1380,Wow. I thought we would be talking a Great Lakes salmon.  But it was fun anyway.
365484,Fisherman,2009-07-23 16:26:00,7201,"Okay, why doen't you start posting pictures of some obscure beetle from outer Mongolia(no offense to any Mongolians).  How about sticking to the local species that will keep everyone informed and honest."
365498,solopaddler,2009-07-23 16:45:00,8605,  You're seriously upset? HAHAHA!  Craig that was pretty interesting thanks! (My guess was sockeye)
365520,Cudz,2009-07-23 17:42:00,2652,I was about to guess raspberry salmon but I guess it was its close relative the cherry salmon.  Damn.  I was close though
365539,craigdritchie,2009-07-23 18:37:00,1586," All in the name of good fun, my friend. Fact is I didn't expect anyone to get it, but what was truly interesting was reading along as people went through the whole process of elimination. Maybe we didn't know what it was, but we sure knew what it wasn't, and that alone is pretty impressive to me. It's especially interesting since this cherry salmon does seem to share so many characteristics from the different salmon species we're more familiar with. There are parts that look chinook-like, and there are parts that really say chum, sockeye or coho. Overall, the closest thing on our shores would be a coho, and that seemed to be the most common answer. Pretty good job, I'd say.  We can do local species too. It would be fun to try a couple of different minnows from the average bait bucket. I guarantee I would screw up most of those!"
365545,Fisherman,2009-07-23 18:49:00,7201,"Upset, my shorts were so tight and knotted that...  knot likely,"
365955,Kerry,2009-07-25 01:59:00,383,Oh god no not the minnow one.Didn't we have one of those about 6 mths ago on a draw or something. Anyway Craig it was a good post and probably a bit of a refresher for many of the salmon species-kinda like subliminal learning through interesting reading.KUDOS Kerry
365972,John Bacon,2009-07-25 02:58:00,3277, I don't expect much of a run this fall.  The 2007 fall run was the last run of MNR stocked coho.  Metro East Anglers resurrected the coho program when we took over operations of the Ringwood hatchery.  The offspring of the 2007 run were stocked in 2008.  We did collect eggs in 2008 as well and will stock them this fall.  The 2008 runs were quite small and collecting enough eggs was a challenge.  I expect a couple more lean years before we start to get good runs of coho's again.
366056,lovetofish,2009-07-25 13:27:00,500,"i really didn't know what it was, now i know why... lol.  Still a very interesting thread, lots of educated comments.  Thanks"
365229,craigdritchie,2009-07-23 01:10:00,1586,"With all the talk about salmon lately, lets have a little fun - take a look at the three photos below and see if you can correctly identify the species.  All three photos are of the same individual fish.  Enjoy!      "

365258,craigdritchie,2009-07-23 01:50:00,1586," I'll second that!  Lets leave it till tomorrow, so more people can have a look and throw their votes into the ring.  Starting to rain as I type this. Pretty much exactly this time last year, a small run of chinooks showed up in Erindale just after a good thunderstorm. I'm talking a very small number of fish, but in that warmer water, when you have them all to yourself, it sure was a lot of fun.  Between those memories and the look of this pretty 'lil fishie, I'm definitely starting to feel the itch."
365306,BillM,2009-07-23 03:13:00,17367,Coho.
365309,Kerry,2009-07-23 03:16:00,383,Chinny's usually have black gums.This one looks like the upper is more whitish.I'll go with COHO.  Kerry

365341,camillj,2009-07-23 05:42:00,1988,"Chromer-Ho  ""Jeremy Holden, an Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters fisheries biologist, noted some 80,000 cohos reared at the Ringwood Fish Culture Station in Stouffville will be seeded at various sites this fall along the Credit River. By utilizing the Credit River, it would create a main run of returning coho salmon for future egg collections, Holden said. Raised at the Ringwood hatchery for about a year, the cohos entering the Credit River will be at the fingerling stage and weigh approximately 0.25 grams. “They will stocked in the stream where they will over reside over winter before smolting out to the lake in the spring of 2009,” he said of the fish, which have a three-year lifecycle and have a tendancy to return to their river where they were stocked during the fall months to fulfill their spawning ritual and then die.""   Who knew ????"
365343,Jonny,2009-07-23 05:56:00,1380,"Going strictly by book larnin', since I've only caught a few salmon - all chinook - and I can't remember the distinguishing features in fine detail...  Process of elimination:  Definitely not Atlantic salmon, which has a few large well-defined spots on head and gill cover, as well as on the sides.  Definitely not pure coho, which has spots only on the top lobe of the tail fin.  Gum colour doesn't help distinguish coho and chinook in the Great Lakes. The gums look black, and since the tail spots are on both lobes, it's looking good for chinook.  What your picture doesn't show clearly is whether the tail spots go pretty well all the way to the extremities. Since they seem to be only at the base of the tail, it's not looking good for chinook.  The male chinook has a bit more of a V in the tail than the female. The female chinook is almost a ""squaretail"" like the brook trout. so are both sexes of coho. So the pretty much square tail in your photo looks good for a female chinook.  The dorsal fin of the chinook is covered with spots, the male coho has a few spots only at the base of the dorsal, the female coho none at all. But your pictures don't show that either.  There are natural hybrids of chinook and coho known.  My bet is on a co-nook, although if I could see the entire tail and it were spotted to the end I'd change that to chinook.  We are talking a Great Lakes fish here, right? You didn't specify.  Anyway, that was fun - I await your revelation..  ---  Or did you throw a real monkey-wrench into this? Could be a steelhead, although that should have some spots on the top of the head. But the tail is similarly spotted. Skamania? I don't know - can't find a really good picture or drawing of one."
365346,John Bacon,2009-07-23 06:12:00,3277,  They were stocked in 2008 as well.
365353,craigdritchie,2009-07-23 11:02:00,1586," I really hope this program is successful. Coho are so much fun to catch they're totally worth the cost of raising them in the hatchery.  Good guesses so far on the salmon ID. I will admit, this is a tough one."
365358,jace,2009-07-23 11:28:00,472,"by eliminationmy way, it's a chum or some sort of hybrid that's displays mostly chum characteristics.  1-is definitely not a coho.   tail wrist is too thin and it's spotted all over ( chum tails are also thin wristed) 2-not a chinook because the body spots are too fine, a chum characteristic (and reds)  -mouth is dark but not as dark as the typical king.. -the body coloring bleeds far into the tail which makes this a chum tail.   man.  have to stay up another 4 hours to make my last connecting flight.   so tired already."
365362,craigdritchie,2009-07-23 11:48:00,1586,"Here's a couple of other pics that may help:  Full body shot:   Another view of the head, this time with the mouth closed:   Finally, this one is a different individual fish, but the same species:   Enjoy!"
365373,jace,2009-07-23 12:15:00,472,  nice coho. didn't think it was that small.  hehe     The tails upper lobe spotting and silverness will be less pronounced later.  and the thicker wrist is obvious in the full shot angle.

365386,Jonny,2009-07-23 13:06:00,1380,"I can't believe I spent so much time on it last night, but it's intriguing even though my experience with salmon is limited.   There are some spots on the dorsal, as well as on both lobes of the tail, so my best guess stays the same."
