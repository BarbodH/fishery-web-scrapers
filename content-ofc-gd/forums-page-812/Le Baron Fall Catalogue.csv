364877,irishfield,2009-07-22 00:37:00,26272,Man you're getting lax Terry... 4 years ago you would have screamed SPAM !
364882,Terry,2009-07-22 00:54:00,14456,"Hey......Hey,Hey,Hey  I have a set of rules I live by to determine SPAM  is it his first post was his last post about the same store/product/business does he put the same post about a  store/product/business on several websites  and most importantly .....am I having a bad day....  yup rules to live by"
364886,ADB,2009-07-22 01:07:00,444,"Lol - I didn't make this post so the store can sell product.  I don't work on commission, and I don't have any sales quotas to meet.  Just simply letting the community know about the new catalogue"
364889,irishfield,2009-07-22 01:08:00,26272,Ya I know ADB... just razin Terry ! I've never had any bad experiences at LB's on Dundas. Still have my Berkley lightning rods and Mag III ABU baitcaster I bought there in 1983 !
364898,silveradosheriff,2009-07-22 01:27:00,1025,Thanks for heads-up!
364903,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-22 01:35:00,3761,"Ok, so I''m tired of hearing about this store. I will get to a Le Baron before the fall, not trying to hijack the thread but where is the closet Le Baron from Oshawa?"

364906,ADB,2009-07-22 01:42:00,444,"From Oshawa to the Markham store should take you about 30-35 minutes.  Just take the 401 to the 404, get off at Steeles and go straight through the lights onto Woodbine.  We'll be on the East (right) side, just after the Costco.  Come in, Mike, and ask for me - I'll show you around."
366113,Newfeeflip,2009-07-25 16:10:00,1,"Might be a little quicker if you go up to Hwy7 and go west to Woodbine and then south  Anyways, just got back from there and $30.   Compared to the same stuff I bought at Crappy Tire which cost me $45...which I just returned! "
