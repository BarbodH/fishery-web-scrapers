Were a group of 8 guys, minimal experience in the Temagami area (as in none). We would like to target Walleye and Lakers if possible. We plan on getting a shoal map. We have a 14' and 16' aluminum, depth finder in 1. What kind of rigs work best for this area? We plan on camping on one of the islands on Cross lake, any thoughts? suggestions for gear to bring for the sites and fishing?"
