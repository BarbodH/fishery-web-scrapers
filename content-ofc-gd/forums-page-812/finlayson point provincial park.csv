A small group of us are heading up to finlayson point provincial park and we are all wanting to fish. None of us have been there before so is there anyone that has some advice on where to fish. We are renting canoes from the park and most likely launching from there. Anyone know of any short portages to a back lake ?? (about 30min portage).  If anyone has info that would be greatly appreciated. Also would anyone know of any trails up there too?  take care all Luke. W"
