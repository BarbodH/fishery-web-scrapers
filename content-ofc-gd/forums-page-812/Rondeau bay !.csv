365761,Lunker777,2009-07-24 13:26:00,866,"Sunday July 19th  Plan was to get up BRIGHT and early to hit the bay with the wife.  The night before, Megan asks one of her friends to come over with her boyfriend (NOT MY GIRLFRIENDS BOYFRIEND HAHAHAH ) ! Well that went later than anticipated, and we didn't get to bed till about 1… so the early morning thing kind of fell by the way side. I ended up getting loaded up, and on the water by about 10:30 AM I missed the top water bite as I saw everyone leaving the shallows for deeper water, so I figured it was done. I headed out in search of some deeper weed beds. I was looking for some sparse weeds I could rip a spinner bait through. I came up to one stretch while motoring along I thought might be good. It was about 6-8 FOW and weeds stretched to the surface here and there. PERFECT  ....I pulled a 180 and headed to the beginning to start a drift. I was using a fire tiger pattern Booyah spinner bait. I landed a couple nice fish… maybe in the 1 LBS range but nothing to be excited about. I searched around there for about an hour or so, It was a decent size area.  Once I figured there was nothing there, I packed up and headed in search of some fish ! I stopped a tossed a few at a couple other places in the bay I thought might work. But I had no bites. Today was more/less a search and destroy day. It was only my 3rd or 4th time out by myself and in the bay since I got my boat and I really took the time to do some searching of my own !  Well, I found it…. Same type of structure as the earlier spot… but a little deeper. The wind was blowing ABSOLUTLY PERFECT… Southwest wind…. Since it was my first time fishing this area I didn’t know how big it was. Well it was huge… I would say about a KM long by half a KM wide…. Perfect weeds, weed lines, random weed patches that stretched right up to the surface…. Lots of holes in the weeds. PERFECT SPOT !!!! I tossed the fire tiger some more with no luck… 1 or 2 fish…. That’s when I decided a change was due… I threw on a straight chartreuse spinner with bronze willow and Colorado. Once that lure hit the water…. It was GAME ON !!!!!!!! I drifted the area 3 times before the wind changed directions and I landed roughly 15-16 fish in about 3 hours. They ranged in size from little dinks up to I would say 3 lbs I didn’t take any pics of the dinks, because I was by myself for one, and I didn’t want to drift to much messing with a small fish !  2 Highlights for the day !  Number 1 highlight...As I was reeling in a decent bass, I would say he was about 2 lbs. As I got him right to the boat I saw 3 others the same size if not bigger trying to steal my lure out of his mouth ! I popped him off and got back in the water as fast as I could but I didn’t get anything else. BLAAAA ! First time that has happened to me !  Highight #2 ...  Was the big fish for the day… I did get a pic of her though ! She was roughly 19 “ long and I don’t know the weight as I didn’t have a battery in my scale but if I had to guess I would say around 3 lbs ???? I dunno, you guys tell me !     This fish weighted in at 2.25 LBS for comparison ...    All in all this spot was DEAD on, there were a few othe guys out I talked to that had NO LUCK all day... It was just one of those days for me I guess....  Thanks for reading the report….. I know it was long ! sorry ! hahah  Stay tuned for July 23rd Report !"
