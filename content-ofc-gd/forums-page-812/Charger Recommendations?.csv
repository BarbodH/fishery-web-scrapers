It is being used for a 12V Trolling Motor and not sure what to get and how much to spend. Here are some of the specs.  BCI Grp#: 24M  Type: SRM-24  RC Min. 25A: 140  Hrs. @ Ampere Load: 5 - 16.4; 15 - 4.6; 25 - 2.3  Thanks,  Dirk"
365522,scugpg,2009-07-23 18:00:00,1373,CTEK make the best chargers on the market in my opinion. http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Au...y%2BCharger.jsp  That's a 3.3A so it'll give it a nice light charge. I have two for my optimas.
365534,Terry,2009-07-23 18:26:00,14456,"you want an Intelligent Battery Charger on-board or portable it should have minimum 5amps, 10 is better, it drops the amps when battery reaches about 85% full to charge the way manufacturers want  a dead 100 amp battery at 5amps charge takes 20 hours to charge the same battery at 3.3 amps takes 30 hours to charge 10 amp charger...10 hours, I like to fish all day and get up in the morning and fish again with a full battery"

365838,Billy Bob,2009-07-24 17:55:00,5865, It's a good choice if you didn't want to go the onboard charging system route.........
