The trip was great. I was concerned about flying with a 6 month old because I didn't want to be one of those people with the crying baby on the plane. Ryan was a better flyer then I am, mostly because he has more patients with idiots then I.  40 plus Celsius and humid every day, but the air conditioning in the room worked, the pool was close and the drinks were cold.  I took a pack rod as as few lures as I've ever brought on a trip. I went for a long, hot walk down the highway in Varadaro to an area that looked promising on the bus ride into the resort. No luck.  Here are some photos from the trip:            I'd like to go back, but it will be in January or February for this Canuck."
