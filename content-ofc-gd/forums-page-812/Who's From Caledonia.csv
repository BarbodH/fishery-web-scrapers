366032,laszlo,2009-07-25 11:51:00,487,Was wondering if any members are from Caledonia? Any of you attend McKinnon Park Secondary between the year in opened  to 1997 or around there? Go to the old high school?   It's been a while since I've seen some old fishing buddies from back in the day.  Laszlo (les) Csordas

Had a childhood job as the Dickee Dee Icecream guy workin for Mike down at Caledonia Tackle when i was a kid. hehe  Ahh the good ole' days of fishing on any given weekend without worry of 40 other people around with their white buckets.   I never went to the old or ""new"" highschool though, moved out over the summer i started highschool.  You may know my Sister  or cousins tho.  They went to the old and new highschools respectively."
