If the screen shots are even close to accurate, this looks pretty amazing. No word on when it will be here, or pricing, at this point.  Here's the basic info on the Lowrance website: Lowrance Structure Scan  And, here's a sample screen shot showing it in split-screen mode ... high res sonar on the left, GPS on the right. Wow!   (click to enlarge)"
365533,TC1OZ,2009-07-23 18:24:00,987,THAT LOOKS AMAZING!~  I guess I need to worry about getting my own boat first!
365536,Terry,2009-07-23 18:32:00,14456,"I was reading lowrance was having problems with the hds units, so I would wait a while  and I also read reports that guys that were testing them like the hummingbird side image better......  I don't know, so I will start saving my money now and in about a year I will decide which one to buy I hope lowrance has all the bugs out cause I like them"
365558,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-23 19:46:00,10439,"I have been drooling over the HDS units since they were annouced last year. I decided to wait a year (always a smart move with new technology) to make sure there were no serious issues. So far the one serious issue has been water leaking into the screen on the smaller units. I'm glad I waited because of this and the fact when I do buy I can now spend more money on really cool toys!!! I saw some video of the side scanning feature posted by Lowrance on youtube a month or two ago and was pretty impressed then, and they didn't even show the down scanning feature. While the side scanning feature is really cool that down scanning feature is awesome!!!!! It's like having a camera mounted to the bottom of your boat pointing at the bottom of the lake.     I need one just so I can run all over the lakes looking for lost boats, cars and snowmobiles!!!!! I GOTTA HAVE ONE!!!!!"
365562,ohhenrygsr,2009-07-23 19:56:00,947, Yea the lowrance had problems early in the year but there was updates for the units on there website
365765,Billy Bob,2009-07-24 13:38:00,5865,"I believe some ""lots"" of the HDS 7 units left the factory with bad seals and rain water was getting inside the units and completely disabling  them. This has now been addressed by Lowrance  I see that the new side scan will be available in Nov '09 at the cost of another $599.00 on top of what your HDS unit already set you back.......a man can never have enough toys, can he ......"
365797,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-24 15:11:00,10439, Great!!! Now I need almost $4000 for my new fishfinder.
365800,Dara,2009-07-24 15:19:00,3052,  that can buy a lot of fish
365801,Billy Bob,2009-07-24 15:25:00,5865, YES it can but catching them is PRICELESS......
365803,blaque,2009-07-24 15:32:00,2419,"Just make friends with people who have the money to own these types of things, its ALOT cheaper"
365817,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-24 16:19:00,1022,
365830,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-24 17:11:00,10439,  About $600 for the side scanning add on and $1000 to $3000 for the multi use display unit.
365831,Uncle Buck,2009-07-24 17:13:00,1000,and they say affordable... LOL
365837,Billy Bob,2009-07-24 17:47:00,5865, Their are many bass fishermen that have already put their names on a waiting list with Three Rivers Marina to insure getting one ASAP......
365840,Jonny,2009-07-24 18:11:00,1380,What you wanna be to make these units worthwhile is a commercial fisherman or a charter boat operator.
365846,blaque,2009-07-24 18:50:00,2419,"weeeeeelllllll, what ya Reaaaaaallllyyy wanna be is filthy stinkin rich and retired"
365852,Dara,2009-07-24 19:11:00,3052,"  and with that much money, your'e doing a lot of stuff besides fishing"

365869,blaque,2009-07-24 20:30:00,2419,Got GAS? Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS)
365872,blaque,2009-07-24 20:31:00,2419,"If i were that wealthy, I would just hire my own personal guide..........with all the fixins"
365878,Jonny,2009-07-24 20:44:00,1380," I dunno, I just find it a bit extreme.  Can you imagine... taking one of these units out so you can participate in the Dollarama Tournament with your $2 reel and $1 lures? Now that would be funny!"
