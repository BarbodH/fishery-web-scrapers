The rules were simple... change would be placed within the fishbowl until the water overflowed the bowl at which point, in a most climactic fashion, the groom would consume the minnows found within (this was DEFINITELY not a fundraiser conceived by me)...  Hours later I noticed that one of the  two minnows had met it's untimely demise. I was not too keen on eating a stanky minnow.  At this point, like any true brother would, a friend stepped forth to heroically eat the bloated and dead minnow, saving me from certain gagging.  As the water overflowed, we brothers bound by cyprinidae swallowed the beasts with a swig of domestic beer...good times were had by all!  This post is not P(eat)A certified."
