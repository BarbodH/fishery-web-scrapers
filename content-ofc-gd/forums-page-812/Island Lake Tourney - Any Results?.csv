It was over at 2:00, I wieghed in a fish at 1:30 that was 2/8"" of a inch out of 3rd place, however it did outweigh the 2nd and 3rd place fish.  It was 4.1 lbs, I believe 2nd place fish was 3.8 lbs  First and second place fish were both 18.9"", 3rd place was 17.8"". Im not 100% sure about the pike category, but i think the leading fish was only about 24 or so inches. While i was regestering my fish, they were measuring a pretty big perch, i bet it was 9- 10 inces. Im not sure on the crappie."
