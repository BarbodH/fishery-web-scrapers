I have been doing the following:  -flipping jigs in heavy cover deep in the bays of elephant.. about 3 FoW (near the lodge and near the narrows)... some bites  -flipping jigs in the cabbage..... rarely a bite but i know theyre in there  -used wacky rigged senkos and spinnerbaits in the swamp near the narrows and hamilton bay focusing on the lilly pad beds.. some bites  -running a strike king red eye shad which has gotten some nice fish but only once in a blue moon.  I have 2 spare baitcasters (jig, spinner, red eye shad, senko, spare, spare).    With all this in mind, are there any fishing spots, lures, and tactics you can provide? Just fished a tournament and only got 2 fish, one of them 4 LBs... which was caught by slowly dragging a jig along the bottom in the cabbage.  THANKS!!!!"
