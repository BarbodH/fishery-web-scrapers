365784,LeXXington,2009-07-24 14:37:00,1928,"Welcome Yan.  For a your first time salmon fishing, better too cast spoons, flatfish, wigglers.  Best time too do this is late Aug into mid Sept. It gets busy out there so arrive early  Fishing in with baits is also fun but requires a little more skil riggigng, hookset etcl. You can use the hook up section here too see if you can join someone going to teach you the finer points.  Stay safe and post results"
