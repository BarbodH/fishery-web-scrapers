365171,bow slayer,2009-07-22 21:51:00,1074,I just picked up a NS5B  5hp Nissan outboard with built in tank for my scanoe. It starts and runs great and looks brand new. It is a mid 90s model.  I was wondering if anyone has any experience with these outboards. I was hoping to find a evinrude or johnson but this came along at the right time. Are these reliable outboards? Should I look to sell it and find something else. Any input would be wonderful. thanks.

365221,pikehunter,2009-07-23 00:34:00,1659,Nissan outboards are Tohatsu. They are sold worldwide so parts should be available if needed. There is a Nissan dealer in Oakville and the marine dealer in Port Dover beside Tim Horton's also sells them.  Is your scanoe rated for a 5hp? That would move along real nice.
365591,bow slayer,2009-07-23 21:07:00,1074,actually it is rated for a 3 hp. for some reason. The other scanoes i came across all were rated for a 5 hp. Maybe coleman had 2 different models.And to answer your question it pushes it along real nice.

365844,doubleheader,2009-07-24 18:48:00,497,I bought a 9.8 HP Nissan for use as a kicker. I'm very satisfied with it. I have a manual start and it always starts first pull and never misses a beat.
