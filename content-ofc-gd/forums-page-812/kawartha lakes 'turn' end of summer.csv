366025,Garry2Rs,2009-07-25 11:17:00,1425,"Not to scientifically speaking, this happens in all lakes that are deep enough to develop a thermocline, during the summer.  Come the fall, when the surface water cools to the point that it becomes cooler, thus heavier, than the bottom layer of water, the surface water will sink and the bottom water will rise.  This is referred to as the the lake ""Turning Over."" This mixing leaves the lake the same temperature from top to bottom...therefore the fish can use all of the water, and are harder to find. The rising bottom water carries some debris into the upper layers and the water becomes somewhat cloudier. However; It won't happen at the end of August! You're looking at the end of September or mid-October"
366027,musky66,2009-07-25 11:38:00,273,Yep- happens later on- wont stop the fish from hitting though. May put them off for a few days- but I catch right until November 15!
366064,Sinker,2009-07-25 13:57:00,8692,"Yep, whoever told you that has no clue.  Sometimes turnover isn't until well into Oct. It just depends on the weather/wind/temps we're getting. Fishing might be slow for a few days, but once the fish get comfy, its some of the best fishing of the season.  S."
366189,smally21,2009-07-25 21:09:00,993,thanks fellas. seemed a little early to be threatening my fishing trips....
366204,gone_fishin,2009-07-25 22:01:00,481,"the person who told you this about Rice is probably talking about the algae bloom in August, and into September... it turns the entire surface of the lake green... like pea soup."
366206,smally21,2009-07-25 22:07:00,993,all kawartha lakes?  nothing unique to rice im guessing.  you are describign a bit of a swamp....im a northern lakes kinda guy and the weeds and algae are new to me - and to my boat!!
366218,Sinker,2009-07-25 22:57:00,8692,"Yeah, we do get algae blooms, but if the weather stays like this it won't happen this year. We need water temps in the 80's to make that happen. Rice was still only 72 yesterday.  S."
