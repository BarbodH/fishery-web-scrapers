All higher end stuff though haha $$$$$$$$$$  I picked up a few maps, drop shot weights, and Im going to try some Terminator spinner baits !"
365465,mbac31,2009-07-23 15:48:00,904,"I buy from them on a regular basis. Great guys to deal with. You will find however that alot of the stuff is getting cheaper to buy here. Blake @ Fishing World has aalot of the hard to find stuff, sometimes cheaper. I buy from Tackle Warehouse all the time. They do have a ton of hard to find stuff."
365472,bdox,2009-07-23 16:06:00,329,"I buy a lot of stuff from them that's not as popular here and subsequently hard to find locally. They have really quick fedex shipping but you need a decent size order to really make it worth it. smalliefisher is correct though, the guys at Fishing World stock some of the more obscure brands and higher end stuff I look for."

365515,EC1,2009-07-23 17:33:00,930,"They had my business at the beginning of the year. They are extremely fast and very helpful, as emails are replied almost on the same day. The only problem I have is that shipping does become kind of expensive if you are buying rods.  Although that is a problem, they ship very fast, and they carry some of the stuff that you wouldn't be able to find anywhere else."
365657,Burning Babies,2009-07-24 00:32:00,150,"I placed an order recently.  Great selection of hard-to-find merch, fast shipping, and some of the best prices on the net right now.  I'm about to place another order."
