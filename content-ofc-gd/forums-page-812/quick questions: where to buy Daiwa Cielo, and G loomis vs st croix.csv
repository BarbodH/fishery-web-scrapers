I am no expert on blanks, but I've heard that GLX still has the edge on sensitivity over the top St. Croix blanks.  St. Croix seems to have better customer support in the area, but again, it's only what I've heard.  GLoomis has also announced they're quitting the blanks biz this year, so that may be a factor too.  Cheers."

Last year they shut down the Canadian operation in Mount Hope, and now they are dropping the sale of blanks to rod builders.  Maybe the book keeping isn't worth the trouble to a multi-national like Shimano."
