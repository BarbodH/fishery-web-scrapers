366016,eze76,2009-07-25 07:16:00,70,Would this way work ?  Doing a slip knot on the spool and reeling in the line ?     If that doest wrk just copy and paste  
366019,TC1OZ,2009-07-25 09:44:00,987,"The ""reel"" fishermen might correct me, but that is good enough....  Like the guy said in the video, if the fish is taking your line right out to the end....chances are you aren't reeling it in anyways....."
366021,FISHINGNUT,2009-07-25 10:52:00,253,Thats how I do it never had a problem
366116,NBR,2009-07-25 16:18:00,163,Use the arbor knot which is nothing more than a slip knot with an overhand knot on the tag end. Thr overhand knot keeps  the line from pulling free through the slip knot when you pull it tight.
366185,eze76,2009-07-25 20:59:00,70,"Thanks alot , ive been wondering how to do it for awhile now lol ,"
366188,Governator,2009-07-25 21:02:00,879,"  Same here, never had a problem."
366192,cuillerierk,2009-07-25 21:18:00,32,"I don't see a problem with that method.  Although I've never had a fish get me that far on my line, so maybe it's wrong. But none the less that's how I do it."
366210,Greencoachdog,2009-07-25 22:26:00,8163,"  That is the correct method, I use a double overhand knot at the end to make the knot a little bigger."
366279,Twocoda,2009-07-26 02:20:00,4130,to add ....halfway through the reel i normally flip the spool on the floor to eliminate any twisting of the line ..
