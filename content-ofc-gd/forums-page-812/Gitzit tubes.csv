365223,bigugli,2009-07-23 00:35:00,6138,Does anyone know of any store in Southern Ontario that carry the Gitzit line of products? I absolutely love their short tubes when smallies are finicky.
365266,JohnF,2009-07-23 01:58:00,3494, Seems to me I saw 'em here in Stratford. I'll check tomorrow.  JF
365421,Beans,2009-07-23 14:09:00,3339,Phenix carries various sizes of salted tubes...I personally like the 2 1/2 inch in smoke color...
365546,JohnF,2009-07-23 18:56:00,3494,I was wrong about the local store having them. I've definitely seen 'em in some store recently so it has to be either Bass Pro in Vaughan or Dick's Sports or Gander Mtn in the States.  Sorry I couldn't help  JF
365616,bigugli,2009-07-23 22:21:00,6138,Thanks for looking.  I know they are popular in the States. Have not seen them @ BPS.
365617,JohnF,2009-07-23 22:29:00,3494, Then check Dick's Sports. There's one in Buffalo I believe.
365637,denisk,2009-07-23 23:56:00,163,Bruce I have lots
365654,bigugli,2009-07-24 00:24:00,6138,I'll be down to see you.
