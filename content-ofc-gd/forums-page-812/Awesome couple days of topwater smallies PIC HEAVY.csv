364992,Radnine,2009-07-22 11:59:00,1538,"Wow what a great report! I lost one that my son had on this past week. I was adjusting his drag for him during the fight and bingo it was gone. He said ""Nice going dad, it was fighting like a walleye too!"" (how cool is it that a seven year old knows the difference in how fish fight?). You'll both get over it (it's almost a better story this way). Jim"
365036,kevinhiles,2009-07-22 14:30:00,22,Great report! That's a ton of fish!
365683,rickster,2009-07-24 02:01:00,495,anytime   five times today before i stopped and grabbed one    no need for coordinates just come on up here to the great northwest and i will take you to the spot
364489,rickster,2009-07-20 22:55:00,495,"It has been about a month since the last time I have made it out fishing but the past couple days have been well worth the wait Saturday I took my son and nephew out for two hours to try for some bass I will let the pics do the talking We fished from about 3-5pm My son wanted to take all the pics                    Went out again on Sunday                        But now for the sickening part My son and I both hooked into fish at the same time I told my nephew to grab the net and bring my sons fish in first We fought our fish to the boat and I looked over to see how big my sons ""bass"" was and all I saw was a monster head He had what I guess was a 40"" plus northern on I quickly got my bass in and released so I could net my sons fish Now he brings the northern in and I get him in the rubber net. But the net has a hole in it (can you guess where the northerns head went) Out through the net he goes but still hooked. He fights it back to the boat  (8lb mono but thankfully a 9"" 30lb leader on) I get it into the net again even though his line is running through the net. I quickly grab it by the gill plate but it starts to thrash around and I lost my grip. You guessed it The fish hit the water went under the boat and the line must have caught a rivet because the line snapped and the fish was gone. I looked up at my son (9 years old) and he had tears in eyes. It made me sick to realize I lost him his biggest fish. All I could do was say I was sorry and tell him he fought it perfectly but that it was my fault it got off."

364517,Rattletrap2,2009-07-21 00:06:00,1652,"Rickster, That is an amazing number of Bass there. If they were all caught on topwater baits, it must have been quite a hoot!"
364521,crankbait,2009-07-21 00:16:00,82,"I'm sure he will have a new pb soon enough. Those are some great photos, looks like great times for all."

364534,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-21 01:01:00,3761,"That has to be the best Smallie report on OFC so far, It's been awhile since I have seen that many fish in that 4lb+ range...and not just for the adult for the kids too  Outstanding job man, that lake looks amazing with those fields of grass( I can see it good in pic's 3 and 4)...I'm wondering if there any largemouth's in this lake you were at?    Anyway, thanks for sharing, MTBF"
364538,TC1OZ,2009-07-21 01:11:00,987,Amazing!!  Good read too! lol

364673,Joey,2009-07-21 14:04:00,9122,"Nice mess of bass there Rickster.  Don't feel too bad about the fish, it happens.  He'll forgive you and you can put him on another one soon.  Kudos to him for getting it to the boat on 8 lb test - Twice     Damn rubber nets  Joey"
364699,LeXXington,2009-07-21 15:11:00,1928,TAKE ME FISHING WITH YOU !!!  Great report.
364710,tightline,2009-07-21 15:37:00,322,That was a stellar day on the water...looks like you guys had a lot of fun tagging those bronzies  ...too bad about the gator tell your boy it happens to all of us and to be thankful he got it out of the way early!!!  Just curios since you work in the fishing dept of your home hardware how many times a day you walk by the nets???  ...Great report and great pics none the less...tell your boy to forget about the one he lost but allways remember the ones he didn't!!!!
364791,Rich,2009-07-21 19:46:00,3927,I'd say that's a pretty freakin' great 2 hours. Despite the lost pike.
364798,Cudz,2009-07-21 19:59:00,2652,wow and wow. Now if you could give me the coordinates of the lake please.  lol. Nice fish indeed. As for the lost pike.  When I was 12 I caught my first lake trout (looked to be a nice 8 pounder or so) and my dad managed to knock it off while netting it. I must admit I had a little cry in the boat.  But tell your son not to worry.  I managed to catch many more lakers after that.  He will get a big pike again.
