364590,Dutch,2009-07-21 02:56:00,831,"Nice little Pelican boat on sale at Costco in Peterborough.  They had 3 units left:  http://www.pelicansport.com/index.php?lang...oat=predatordlx  Looked like a nice set-up for $500, for ponds or small back lakes.  Has an aerated livewell with pump, 12V plugs at the bow and stern and has a mounting bracket at the front for a TM.  Also comes with rod holders and a nice sized livewell.  Just thought I would let people know.  Can even find these used on Kijiji for this price."
364596,Bernie,2009-07-21 03:07:00,3190,"Add in your battery, a couple tackle boxes, a powerplant of some description, maybe a cooler for your lunch and refreshments plus a few other things you better be a skinny couple in the boat. 500 lb capacity."
364604,MCTFisher9120,2009-07-21 03:20:00,3761,"Looks like a nice boat. With 2 people, a nice trolling motor and some rods weight should not be a issue.  Thanks for posting, MTBF"
364607,ciceri,2009-07-21 03:29:00,535,"Saw that at CTC once, looks like a good boat for rivers, creeks, small lakes/ponds. Easily fit into a small pick up too."
364612,Rattletrap2,2009-07-21 03:33:00,1652,"I saw this deal at the Barrie store last week as well! Looks really good,but unfortunately the payload capacity is too light for me!  They also had a good deal on a pontoon float boat for about $239.00. Real nice for one person!"
365567,Jonny,2009-07-23 20:12:00,1380," Hmmm... not quite I don't think. Your distance from side to side in the box is probably about 50"" above the wheel wells. This boat is 61"" wide. You could probably rack it above the box easily enough though, if the seats are removeable for turning it upside down. "
365576,Kenny G,2009-07-23 20:34:00,118,I was the same thing if the seats were removable? Kenny G.
365584,Dara,2009-07-23 20:45:00,3052,I think for my uses a used 12' aluminum would be better
365644,Jonny,2009-07-24 00:07:00,1380,"A typical 12' aluminum would weigh less, carry more, and probably be easier to handle. It would be my choice too. But used 12 footers are sometimes hard to come by and probably not any cheaper, if they're in good shape."
365734,pikehunter,2009-07-24 10:11:00,1659,"12' aluminum would be better, however 500 bucks is a great price. Be a nice little boat for ponds like Valens, Mountsberg or Binbrook. You might get it onto the top of a pickup truck box but the weight is 154 lbs.  Weight capacity is actually pretty good at 500 lbs. A Lowe 10' Jon only weighs 80 lbs. but only has a capacity of 275lbs. A 12' Lowe Jon: 90lbs. and 330 lbs. but the wider 12' x 32"" is 140lbs and 527 lb capacity. So in comparison at 500 lb capacity the little Costco boat is respectable....and cheap at 500 bucks! If I had only had a truck to put it in..."
