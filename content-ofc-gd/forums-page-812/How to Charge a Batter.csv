365392,blaque,2009-07-23 13:20:00,2419,And you thought this was a silly question with an easy answer lol.
365397,blaque,2009-07-23 13:24:00,2419,This is what i have tucked behind the seats  
365417,fishinggeek,2009-07-23 14:03:00,325,"I'm in the west end of Toronto.  So much information!  I didn't plug anything in as I don't want to damage anything.  Should I buy a 24V charger, or get an on-board charger, or both?  With an on-board charger, how do I charge it if I'm at the cottage without an outlet nearby?  I guess I might need both it sounds like.  Can anyone recommend a good marine shop that can help me out that's relatively close?"
365419,Billy Bob,2009-07-23 14:06:00,5865, Here's some INFO that might be helpful for you..... http://www.insideline.net/1996/puckett-1112-96.html
365425,Billy Bob,2009-07-23 14:12:00,5865, You do NOT need both.......the onboard charger can/should be used while the boat is docked...just run a extension cord down to the boat...plug in and clean up that mess of fish while enjoying a nice cold Canadian beer....your batteries are being attended while you can do other things than worry about them......(you might need to purchase some 100ft extension cords).   Bob
365430,fishinggeek,2009-07-23 14:26:00,325,"Thanks for the link Bob!  It's great and very informative.  To complicate things, I'm going to put on a transom-mounted 12V trolling motor.  Since my 2 batteries are in a serial connection (I'm sure of it), they're 24V.  So now it sounds like I need to disconnect them, have one hooked up to the trolling motor, and one to start the engine?  Sorry about the hassle guys.  When I bought the thing, the dealer who installed it said the main motor will do all the charging I need for the batteries and I won't have to worry about it, so it was never explained to me.  Since I can't return the favour, I'll be making a charitable donation for everyone's help.  Much appreciated."
365432,Terry,2009-07-23 14:28:00,14456,  you do not want a trickle charger for deep cycle batteries you want a smart charger there are 3 stages to charging and the first part is  charging with 10 to 20 amps till the battery reaches about 85% charge then amps need to be reduced so battery doesn't boil  the rest is to bring it to 100 % and maintain it
365439,fishinggeek,2009-07-23 14:43:00,325,"http://www.batteries-faq.com/activekb/ques...hp?questionid=1  That's from my battery's website.  If I'm reading it right, I should be charging at 20/10 amps, or 2 amps.  I should start with the bulk charge with voltage of 14.4V and amperage of 10 amps.  Then I go to absorption stage where I have 2amps and 15.5V for the last 2-4 hours.  I won't even try to interpret the float and equalization until I understand the bulk and absorption charges.  Am I right or wrong?"
365442,Terry,2009-07-23 14:48:00,14456,yeah that is good info and a smart chargers will do that for you automatically
365446,fishinggeek,2009-07-23 14:55:00,325," Phew!  I'm glad I read it right.  So I should do a float charge at 2amps and 8.8V every few weeks in addition to normal charging.  How long should the float charge go for?  And I should do a equalization charge at 2amps and 15.6V for a couple hours every month or two in addition to normal and float charing?  Is this right?  Adjusting the voltage for the temperature seems easy enough.  Also to hook up my 12V electric motor, I need to disconnect my serial connection and keep 2 separate batteries or have them in parallel?  If I do that, will it affect the starter at all?"
365455,Billy Bob,2009-07-23 15:33:00,5865, Relax and get yourself a Onboard charger that takes care of your marine deep cycle AND starting battery by just plugging the thing in..............I have a starting battery that has been pampered by my onboard charger for over 8 years now and it seems as strong as when new........
365466,fishinggeek,2009-07-23 15:48:00,325," Is it the same as an intelligent charger, and if not, is it any better/worse?  ""Intelligent"" charger sounds so much better.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Au...y%2BCharger.jsp  Is that one a good one?  It says it chargers at 15amps, but shouldn't I get one that can finish the charge off with a trickling 2amps?"
365470,Terry,2009-07-23 16:02:00,14456,yeas that wold work just fine and this one too  http://www.lebaron.ca/pdf_files_sp09/fishi...kota_access.pdf  MK 220 • 2 bank • 10 amps output per bank • 20 amps total output CODE: 1822200 $ 229.94
365493,Tybo,2009-07-23 16:39:00,1373,To charge a series circuit system with a 12v charger. You must charge one battery at a time.
365503,Terry,2009-07-23 16:57:00,14456,a 2 bank on-board charger charges both batteries in serial at the same time     parallel  to 12v trolling motor 
365542,Billy Bob,2009-07-23 18:42:00,5865,"WOW..........three pages on a simple ""how should I charge a Battery""............can't wait until what oil should I use........LOL  What part of the ""ONBOARD CHARGER"" that is specifically designed and manufactured for marine use that we are having trouble understanding ?  ?  ?  Call it the smart charger, onboard charger, intelligent charger or DAH charger over there it's still does the exact same thing to charge and maintain your expensive marine batteries.............."
365647,Cookslav,2009-07-24 00:13:00,1457," Gotcha... I'm always in Parallel. I figured as much as it works, and has worked for the past 4 years LOL!"
365211,fishinggeek,2009-07-22 23:58:00,325,"Sorry about the dumb question, but can someone explain how to charge my boat batteries step-by-step?  I couldn't find it on google.  It's intimidating because there's a wing nut on each terminal, and a metal post.  Do I take off the wing nuts, or just put the clamps on the terminal?  Do I do the positive or negative first, or does it matter?  I know I'm not that sharp with these things so feel free to laugh at me!"
365213,Rich,2009-07-23 00:06:00,3927,"You attach the clips to the ""metal posts"" .. it doesn't matter which you connect first. I personally prefer to plug in the charger AFTER connecting it to the battery though."
365215,fishinggeek,2009-07-23 00:11:00,325,"Thanks Rich!  I have 2 batteries though.  I know to charge one at a time, but if I put clamps on the post, will it damage the other battery?  I assume they're on the same circuit."
365216,Rich,2009-07-23 00:12:00,3927,"From what I remember, we used to hook them up while they were still linked in tandem. Can't remember if they charged in tandem or not. But either way it shouldn't cause any damage.  (I say we used to cuz I only got the one battery now)"
365218,Terry,2009-07-23 00:25:00,14456,"you are not giving enough info to answer your question are the batteries hooked together for the trolling motor, and is the trolling motor 12 or 24 volts or is it a trolling motor battery and a starting battery what kind of charger is it 12 or 24 is it a one bank two bank"
365220,Big Cliff,2009-07-23 00:32:00,6899,"ASSUMING they are connected in parallel (+ on one to + on the other, and - on one to - on the other), connect your charger + lead to the + post on one battery and the - lead of the charger to the - of the same battery. it will charge both batteries for you. Connect your charger leads first, then plug in your charger. If the batteries are connected in series (- on one battery to + on the other) you need more help! Let me know!"
365225,TC1OZ,2009-07-23 00:55:00,987, 
365226,fishinggeek,2009-07-23 01:07:00,325,"Thanks everyone (in advance - I'm sure there's more questions).  They're 2 Interstate deep cycle batteries hooked up together.  Is it bad to charge both at once?  I've gotten so much help from the board, but have given so little back.  I swear it's only because I have no knowledge!  And they are both 12 V."
365232,TC1OZ,2009-07-23 01:12:00,987,"Battery charged in series, easier to show in a diagram :  http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/3064/chargeseries.jpg  (still following Big Cliffs instructions for powering on your charger)"
365235,irishfield,2009-07-23 01:16:00,26272,Not... unless he's got a 24V charger...
365238,TC1OZ,2009-07-23 01:20:00,987,I guess he wouldn't realize that the power would have to be the entire voltage of both batteries....  Like everyone is saying we need more info...   How many chargers/whats the voltages....  and most importantly how are the batteries connected?
365245,Terry,2009-07-23 01:29:00,14456,"if he takes some of the advise without answering the questions, he could blow his batteries up because there are many ways batteries can be hooked up in a boat and no one can give you a good answer with the correct info"
365248,danbouck,2009-07-23 01:35:00,4380,  Please don't do this unless you have a 24v charger.
365249,danbouck,2009-07-23 01:36:00,4380, Best answer so far!
365255,fishinggeek,2009-07-23 01:46:00,325,Thanks.  I haven't attached anything yet.  They're 2 12V batteries.  They're configured exactly like that picture.  I have a Canadian Tire Intelligent Charger rated for 12 V.  So I can't do it?
365256,danbouck,2009-07-23 01:48:00,4380,If they are wired like the picture then disconnect the jumper and charge one battery at a time.
365259,Cookslav,2009-07-23 01:51:00,1457," If you charged them long enough would they not charge fully? Just curious I usualy charge my 4 batteries up on a 12volt linked and leave the whole heap on the trickle charger for storage at the trailer. When I come up each weekend all the batteries show a full charge?  I would assume the 12V does the trick, but maybe takes longer? No idea...I just know it either works or my battery gage is pooched LOL!"
365260,danbouck,2009-07-23 01:54:00,4380, If they are hooked in parallel than it would be fine but they are hooked in series so you end up with 24v
365264,fishinggeek,2009-07-23 01:56:00,325," Dan, is the jumpber the one with the wing nuts?  Any risk of me being shocked?"
365275,Dara,2009-07-23 02:22:00,3052,"I think your best bet is to unhook all the wires from one battery, mark them so you know how to put em back, charge that battery, then unhook the other and charge it. Either that or take it to a dealer and have him tell you how to hook it up. If you aren't sure, don't mess with it. It could get expensive"
365350,Ron,2009-07-23 10:24:00,1683,"Cost of batteries - $100.00 to $350.00 per battery.  Taking pictures of wiring and posting on the internet = free  Go to a marina or automotive shop with boat in tow to seek advice = free to $30.00  Not knowing how yours are wired up, I would be willing to spend the $30.00. That is still cheaper than the battery charger if you happen to blow that up too."
365354,Billy Bob,2009-07-23 11:23:00,5865,I have to agree that messing with batteries for someone that has no clue could be DANGEROUS and very expensive........so here's the best advice I can forward to you........get one of these onboard chargers and then you only have to plug it in and you are done. It will charge the batteries and maintain them at all times even through the winter months. Have someone that knows how to install this charger on your boat (not a big job) and all your batteries worries are gone plus it will pay for itself over time because it extends the life of these expensive marine batteries.  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true   Bob
365355,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-23 11:23:00,1022,"Get yourself a portable trickle charger that is automatic. The slower you charge, the better it is for your battery. Your batteries will hold the charge longer this way. Make sure you charge your batteries at the end of every outing."
365359,Billy Bob,2009-07-23 11:31:00,5865, Trickle chargers are NOT designed to charge deep cycle batteries. They can cause damage to these very expensive deep cycle batteries. His best charger would be a good onboard marine charger.........not to mention from what I have read he has a 24 volt system in his boat........so that would also be a good reason NOT to use a portable trickle charger.
365363,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-23 11:49:00,1022," I think I'm going to disagree with you on this one. When I bought my boat it was once owned by an electrician, and he had a 1.5A onboard charger in the boat. I have also read on this board that charging it slowly is best.  Can anybody else clarify this?"
