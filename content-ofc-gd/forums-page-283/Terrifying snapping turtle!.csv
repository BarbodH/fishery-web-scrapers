Fishing was tough - pretty much chocolate milk and lots of current everywhere but it beat sitting at home so I gave it a shot.  After an hour or so of watching stuff drift by I noticed one of the pieces of drift wood was looking at me!  Bloody 2' wide snapping turtle drifted by just a few feet away while I was up to my waist.  That gave me a start but was kind of cool non the less (once I was sure he hadn't stopped behind me). Anyhow, on my way back to the car I nearly stepped on a frog and then nearly stepped on these guys, guess that explains the floating one...           Oh yeah, managed this as well  "
