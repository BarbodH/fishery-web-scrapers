806081,irishfield,2013-09-02 23:56:00,26272,I even know someone with a hoist to do the change Terry !
806085,Sour_Squirrel,2013-09-03 00:08:00,196,The only reason I have the oil changed at my mechanics is because my Cherokee came with an extended warrantee and I need a receipt as proof that I had regular maintenance done on the vehicle for the warrantee to remain valid. The oil my mechanic uses costs $13/litre.  I can't recall the name but it's a high end oil with a German name.  It meets and exceeds the specs required for the engine. I use 5w20 synthetic oil.
806112,Carp,2013-09-03 02:55:00,1488,"Bought the 2008 Grand Cherokee Diesel about 1 1/2 years ago. Had a problem with the air intake hose leaking oil onto the actuator motor and frying it. (Coming from crankcase vent hose connected to air intake) Fault the person who last took it off and didn't put it on properly. The motor becomes very sluggish and limits power output. ( I assume as a safety measure) Chrysler wanted to drop the entire engine to fix it at a cost of several thousand $$$. An independant shop wanted $1500. After searching for a solution online, I discovered several people who have dealt with the same issue.  The fix: a  $ 0.25 resistor you can buy at most electronics shops. Yes, I said twenty five cents. You disconect the electrical plug for the actuator, slip the resistor's pins into the plug and computer thinks the actuator is still working fine. Motor runs like normal again. Been driving like this for over a year with no problems. Apparently, the actuator isn't really needed.  Oil changes are very expensive through Chrysler. I think I paid $226. for the first oil change. Canadian Tire does not sell this oil. Using any oil without the correct spec could damage the diesel particulate filter at a cost of about $3000. (although, I know some people have removed the DPF and tweaked the computer which allows them to use cheaper diesel engine oil) The oil is very specialized 229.5 spec (not 229.51) low sulfur oil and not easily found in Canada. About $16/litre at the dealer. The engine takes about 9.5 litres, so $160+ tax just for the oil. Oil changes are recommended every 10,000 km for this clean burning 3.0 litre diesel.  Solution: I bought a Mity Vac. A large cylinder with manual pump that's specifically made for stuff like oil changes. Found the oil for a cheap price through an independent auto parts shop. $30 for a 5 litre jug compared to $16 for 1 litre. Picked up an oil filter for about $14 and did the next oil change myself. The oil filter is at the top of the engine, so very easy to change. All I had to do was buy the specialty socket to loosen the cap. $27 at the same local tool shop where I found the Mity Vac. If I'm not mistaken, Princess Auto carries them (or similar product) and probably cheaper than what I paid.  Everything went so well with this oil change, I did the same thing on my 2011 diesel Jetta. Paid over $100 at the dealer the last time I took it in. Only takes 5 litres though. Again, oil filter is on top of the engine. Takes the same MB229.5 (VW507) oil, so I bought a dozen 5 litre jugs for future oil changes. Had to buy another large socket to get the cap off the housing to access the oil filter. ($15) The money I saved on these two oil changes was more than enough to pay for all the tools I bought. Oil changes are recommended every 15,000 km on the Jetta's 2.0 litre clean burning diesel engine.  Would I buy the Grand Cherokee with Mercedes 3.0 litre diesel engine a second time? Absolutely !!!  Truck is rated to tow up to 7400lbs. My boat and trailer probably weigh 2500 lbs, so not an issue. Towed my utility trailer with a full load of firewood (approx. 3500- 4000 lbs.) without any problem. Engine is strong, fuel efficient and it's cheaper to fill the tank with diesel. (todays prices)  Hope this helps !"
806113,BillM,2013-09-03 03:08:00,17367,"Yup, the issues you were having with your Jeep were with the EGR, can't beat a $0.25 fix!     Make sure the oil you're using for your Jetta is VW507 approved or else they'll give you a hard time if you ever need warranty repairs (Although I suspect you're using Mobil 1 ESP 5w30 which is both MB 229.5 and VW507 approved)   FYI, OCI for your Jetta is 16,000kms    Also can't beat canister filters!  So easy to replace without getting oil all over the place."
806411,musky66,2013-09-04 23:09:00,273,Finally found my next jeep after over two weeks of online searching an test drives. 2011 Jeep GC Limited with the 5.7 Hemi- amazing vehicle so far ( a few weeks) and the Hemi power is smoother and faster than my 07 Overland. Hope she serves me well for many years to come.

801274,Raf,2013-08-01 15:26:00,3495, do any of them even have a 4LO or at the very least a part time 4WD setting? from what I can tell they are all full time AWD systems.  that right there limits where they can go not too mention the ground clearance which the GC has plenty of as well as entry and departure angles.
801277,Angler management,2013-08-01 15:40:00,280,Land rover and mercedes G wagon have all the above and then some. But the G wagon has a higher price range. You do get what you pay for tho. I know if i was looking for all those features i would just go with a good old diesel pickup.
801285,Woodsman,2013-08-01 17:03:00,1286,"Actually ""jeep"" was not registered as a brand name until 1950 although filed in 1943 by Willys-Overland. It's commonly believed the name came from the Ford built version during WW2 the GPW. The GP became slanged into ""jeep""."
801310,bassassin,2013-08-01 19:10:00,152,toureg v6 diesel. Buddy works at Yorkdale VW... 1100km on a $100 tank and diesel is $.10 cheaper then gas... he pulls a 24ft cuddy cabin with it. and takes it in some sticky areas to fish smaller lakes. It all comes down to preference. but believe me all the suvs can get you where you need to go. if you want the best bang for your buck Liberty CRD that common rail diesel is the crap! ask anyone that frequents europer they are everywhere and can handle anything just service them when required in the manual and there is no reason it cant get you to a half mollion km's. then calculate over that distance how many $$$ you saved on fuel? guarantee the savings offset the cost and then some...

801364,Raf,2013-08-02 00:43:00,3495,"if your only complaint was the lack of power in the diesel, test drive one with the 5.7L hemi.  it'll push you back in your seat, that's for sure.   there's a big premium for the diesel which means you can get a newer model / lower mileage 5.7L for the same price.  also remember that the diesel is a turbo and there is a bit of lag, if you're not used to turbo charged vehicles, it can seem like there is a lack of power but once that turbo spools she moves.  if there were other issues with it that you didnt like, then carry-on!"
801365,Sinker,2013-08-02 00:47:00,8692,I've regreted having GM's many times over. Never again.  S.
801367,Sinker,2013-08-02 01:06:00,8692,"Yes, driving a turbo is very different. Especially a turbo diesel. You will find the diesel seems sluggish, but wait until you come to a hill....you won't even know its there.  I don't know anything about that jeep, or the engine, but when I first got my turbo, I was expecting a lot more jam off the hop. Mine really starts pulling at around 4000 rpms, and hauls ass to 6500. Seems gutless under 3000.  S."

805995,Sour_Squirrel,2013-09-02 03:23:00,196,"Going back to the initial inquiry about a diesel Cherokee. I own a 2008 Grand Cherokee Overland.  I bought it a few months ago from a Chrysler dealership for $20,000.  It had about 156,000km on it when I bought it.  I wasn't concerned that it wasn't a low mileage vehicle.  It appeared to be in decent shape.  It came with every possible option available for the vehicle.  It had a few items replaced for certification prior to me taking it off the lot. One of the 'pros' about buying from an actual Chrysler dealer as opposed to Joe-Blow's used car sales.   I don't trust those small shady car dealers. I drive it to/from work everyday doing the round trip in about 80km's.   That's about 80% highway and 20% city.  Actually works out to be more like 80% city and 20% highway as I live and drive through Toronto's highways!!    Anyways I'm usually averaging 10.7-10.9 l/100km.  That's driving with a light foot and with the A/C on maybe 30% of the time. I also use my diesel Cherokee to tow my boat.    I have a 2003 Lund Explorer 1675 with a 90 Evinrude e-Tec, Minn Kota Maxxum up front, three batteries, electronics, fishing gear and usually a full tank of gas.  Not to mention the trailer.  I estimate boat, motor, trailer and everything else to be around 2,300 lbs maybe more.  I also don't tow the boat with a cover so there's extra drag there. So on my trips to the Kawarthas with boat in tow I'm averaging 14.3-14.6 l/100km. A lot better mileage than my previous vehicle - a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland with the 4.7 litre high output engine. It use to average about 23 l/100km when towing!! Although the diesel doesn't have the acceleration as the gas engine did it does manage to get everything up to speed without any issues.   Besides when towing my boat I don't care what 0-60 is. On guy questioned the vehicle's ability to brake while towing.     If you have a heavy trailer it should have brakes on it anyways so braking shouldn't be an issue.    I have brakes on my trailer.  Some say its not necessary and overkill for what I have but it's good to have.  Actually the previous owner of the boat bought it from the US and the state where it was originally registered required it to have brakes since it weighed over 1,000 lbs. But going back to the brakes of the vehicle it has bigger brakes (4 wheel discs) than the previous generation. The brakes on my 2002 weren't anywhere as good as the 2008. Since owning the vehicle I've only had two issues.  The check engine light came on a couple of times.  First time was caused by a faulty cam position sensor.  It was replaced under warrantee. Just last week the light came on again.  I plugged my code reader in and it the corresponding codes were for bad heater circuits 4 & 5.   I had two bad glow plugs.   Wasn't covered under warrantee so I bought the parts and changed them myself.   Two glow plugs (Bosch) cost $58 with tax. Finally you may be in for a surprise when you take it for an oil change.  Don't expect to bring it in at those $19.95 oil change places.  The engine requires a high grade synthetic oil.  9.5 litres!! An oil change cost me $160 and it has to be done every 10,000km. I'd also change to fuel filter/water separator every second oil change. For those that are curious I'm no novice when it comes to diesels.  Previous diesel vehicles previously owned include a 99 GMC Sierra dually, 99 GMC Suburban 2500, 2003 VW Jetta and I presently also own a 1987 Toyota Land Cruiser. Well there's my $0.02 about the Grand Cherokee Diesel Overland."
806003,BFSC Kevin,2013-09-02 06:06:00,1351,"So, sour_squirrel, are you happy with your purchase? how does it compare to your previous diesels? We can be twins! I run a 1675 lund with a 75 etec and I was interested in a diesel GC.."
806004,Sour_Squirrel,2013-09-02 10:05:00,196,"I'm happy with the diesel Cherokee. It's a good driving vehicle, looks good, gets decent fuel economy and wasn't too expensive. There was people writing in saying that for $50-60,000 they could get something else.  Well maybe back when it was new but today the price of it has gone way down.   I've seen them selling between $15-30,000. Keep in mind that the diesel Cherokee was only available for two years;  2007 and 2008. As for comparisons to other diesels I've owned. It's great.  The 3 litre Mercedes runs smooth and is quiet.   At idle you can barely tell it's a diesel.    As you're driving you can't hear the engine at all. There's no black smoke like on the other diesels I've had even while accelerating. So don't let anyone say that it's noisy and smelly. I fill up at the local gas station for $1.199 while gas is priced at $1.309 for regular (I don't even know what premium sells for these days). If you are looking for a diesel Cherokee on suggestion is to get a model that has the optional NAV reciever.    Not for the GPS which I think is kind of crappy but for the backup cam.   It's the best thing ever invented for backing up to your trailer and  hooking it up yourself."
806010,Renegade67,2013-09-02 13:17:00,86,Compared with what you have I feel the biggest adjustment would be room.   The cabin on the jeep and interior space is considerably smaller than the GM you are use to.
806042,Fisherman,2013-09-02 19:26:00,7201,Do the oil changes yourself and you'll probably save half the price.
806043,Terry,2013-09-02 19:28:00,14456,and buy the oil when ctc puts it on sale
806050,BillM,2013-09-02 21:02:00,17367, Make sure it's an approved oil for the engine... Only stuff that will work for most diesels sold at CT is either Rotella T6 5w40 or Mobil 1 TDT 5w40.
806053,Terry,2013-09-02 21:08:00,14456,I assumed  he would only use approved oil as I do for my jeep diesel which I buy on sale at ctc Mobil 1 0W-40
806055,BillM,2013-09-02 21:14:00,17367, I buy T6 for my TDI as well... Usually have it onsale for $29 once in a while.
801040,Steve,2013-07-31 01:10:00,2075,"Hello,  I've owned a 2003 Yukon SLT for the last 7 years .... and I'm thinking its time for an upgrade.  Anyone know anything about the Grand Cherokee Overland Diesel's?  I must admit, I don't know much about the Jeep line of trucks ... and I've never owned a diesel before.  Gas mileage is gas mileage...it has never been much of a concern for me.  I'm thinking more along the lines of reliability, Quinte in December, rough northern ramps (that can't even be called ramps, lol).  My Yukon never let me down .... handled everything I could throw at her.  Oh, I tow a boat package that weighs about 1,800 lbs."
801089,Raf,2013-07-31 13:30:00,3495,"can't comment on the diesel motor  i wouldn't worry too much about getting stuck at a crappy ramp though.  it's a jeep.  the overland is the top of the line with a pretty nifty 4wd system that's not quite a true locker but waaaay better than an lsd or an open differential.  it will automatically lock left/right side if it detects slip at either side.  even if you have one wheel in the air, it will get you out of trouble whereas an open diff will just spin the wheel in the air.   4lo locks front to back and the full time mode transfers power to the front if the rears slip.  you are not getting stuck in it unless you do something foolish.  it'll handle offroad much better than your yukon if you have a half decent set of tires on it.  i own an older GC limited with a v8.  i believe the tow rating is 5000lbs.  the diesel should be similar. i've towed ~2500lb package with no issues with mine, and towing my boat which is under 1000 -- you don't even notice it's there."
801090,BillM,2013-07-31 13:47:00,17367,"Engine is sourced from Mercedes (Unlike the VM Motori engine in the Liberty)...  It's pretty much bulletproof.  Can't go wrong, great choice."
801099,Angler management,2013-07-31 16:02:00,280,"Great truck, great motor! But be advised that your service will cost a fortune for the diesel benz. Even more so through chrysler then mercedes. Chrysler has to pay mercedes for parts then markup for profit. I have a friend who greatly regreted his diesel benz/chrysler due to maintenance costs. I own a diesel so i know the costs associated with the maintenance, but mercedes is known to be a major rip-off when it comes to service and parts. With that said, my friend still goes to mercedes for parts for his chrysler vehicle to save money... Crazy! Personally i would much rather spend the $ on a Vw/audi. Or even add few extra bucks for a benz. Quality of dodge vehicles doesnt justify the price in my opinion. Very similar to dodge sprint vans that had mercedes diesel motors, fell apart in no time opposed to mercedes versions that still drive around in mint condition 12years later."
801100,BillM,2013-07-31 16:08:00,17367,"If you go to the dealer for parts, you deserve to get bent over, lol.  Absolutely no need to .  So many vendors out there that can get you the parts for a fraction of the cost.  Also, the Sprinter vans were always Mercedes, there's no Dodge in them at all (Unless you count the badging)"
801103,ketchenany,2013-07-31 16:43:00,3229,"I had a 1995 GC with a straight 6. Best vehicle I've had sold it with 373,000 km. Did not burn or leak a drop of oil. It's till going in Fergus 3 years later.  BillM I've never been to a dealer, am I missing something"
801105,BillM,2013-07-31 16:58:00,17367,"Al, high prices and bad service (I'm making a sweeping generalization here)   :)"
801106,Angler management,2013-07-31 17:07:00,280,"In order to keep your warranty all replacement parts must be genuine parts. Aftermarket parts are much cheaper, most genuine parts especially mercedes parts can only be ordered from mercedes. Not to mention aftermarket parts are garbage Chinese parts for the most part that dont last half as long. As for the sprinter follow the link...http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Sprinter"
801107,Steve,2013-07-31 17:10:00,2075,"hmmm, thanks for the advice.  sounds like a quality vehicle with some extra maintenance costs.  may be test driving it tomorrow.  thanks again gents."
801108,Angler management,2013-07-31 17:16:00,280,"Btw im not bashing jeeps, to me it seems like they hold up much better then the rest of the older chrysler line. Im just not a fan of dodge bodies as most of them i see driving around are rusted out after couple years. I think that dodge makes some of the best motors ever made."
801113,Raf,2013-07-31 17:28:00,3495,"i sold my regular/nongrand cherokee with the straight 6 4.0L at 400,000kms motor/trans/xfer case were all still strong (and original).  a kid bought it and wheeled it hard for a year after that - it's likely still running if he didn't roll it lol.   it's shame they don't make that motor anymore but the newer engines are lighter and more efficient."
801114,BillM,2013-07-31 17:40:00,17367," Where do people come up with this?   As long as you're using a OE equivalent, your warranty is just fine.   You actually think Mercedes makes ALL their own parts?   There are all kinds of OE vendors out there that produce 'Mercedes' parts...  Mahle, Mann, Bosch, Litens, Hepu...  the list keeps going and going.   Same thing with VW/Audi and all the imports for that matter.  Stop spreading misinformation."
801116,Angler management,2013-07-31 17:51:00,280,"Is that something the dealer told you or something that you heard elsewhere? Because in the end, its the dealer that decides whether they will honour the warrantee or not based on your servicing. And im spreading what i heard from my dealership and what my best friends first hand experiance was with his dealer. Not to mention that most ppl have no clue what parts they are getting when shopping aftermarket suppliers."
801119,BillM,2013-07-31 18:04:00,17367," Who do you know that's been denied warranty work because they bought a part for their car at a place OTHER than the dealer?

However, at that price range i would definetly not be buying a dodge! I would suggest shopping around and test driving other diesel SUV. Such as BMW X5, audi Q7, VW taureg, and mercedes B class.."
