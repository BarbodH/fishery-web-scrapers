806563,Fang,2013-09-05 22:22:00,1330,Bronte launch is in the same spot as always. West side of rivermouth. I think it's $15 or $17. I don't look I just plug in the credit card and print a ticket.
806581,mike rousseau,2013-09-06 02:48:00,4661,Ouch...  I have 2 nice free public launches within 5-10 minutes of my house...  $15-$17... That would add up considering I launch 2-4 times a week....
806606,Roe Bag,2013-09-06 12:55:00,246, Thanks. Much appreciated.
806624,ch312,2013-09-06 15:33:00,1590, Must be nice. A few launches on the north shore of Erie are $20.
806625,Fang,2013-09-06 15:36:00,1330,That's why I love Crystal Beach $5
806627,BillM,2013-09-06 15:54:00,17367,PC ramp is free after the GSOD is over no?  I know it's free before the derby.
