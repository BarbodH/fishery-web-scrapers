805992,adolson,2013-09-02 02:39:00,783,"  I met up with Rod Caster this afternoon to try catching a lake trout, and managed to do so shortly after I gave up and stopped really trying. Caught it on a spinner, casually casting to open water while drifting. It was a gorgeous day, not too hot, not too cool, sun wasn't blaring. It was just nice to get out with someone, as my trips this year have been much more limited than last year, and quite lonely as my son doesn't yet share my love for the Sportspal. Soon..."
805994,Rod Caster,2013-09-02 03:02:00,5784,"Great day for sure! I found it so funny how out-of-touch we both were with our fishing.... I sort of felt like those people who get bored after not catching for 10 minutes...hence the jig/worm combo hanging off the boat for the last hour hahaha. None the less, I had a great time and FINALLY seeing a fish from that lake was a BONUS!"
