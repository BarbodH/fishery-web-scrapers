806093,shimano19,2013-09-03 00:38:00,196,"during the first week of july my dad, brother and myself took a 10 hour drive north to a fishing lodge. we do one every season and this year we chose richies end of the trail lodge. it was a great experience. the host and guides mentioned to us that the walleye fishing wasn't going to be as spectacular as it always is because the may fly hatch came late this year...and boy it came big. some morning the surface of the water was covered in dead may flies. so we knew the walleye were already getting easy meals.  the first day of fishing was really tough...we didn't manage as many walleye as we had nearly hoped. so the next day we set out with different tactics. we slowed down all our presentations and fished all kinds off different structure. and it payed off. it turned out to be an awesome week of fishing once we found what the fish would respond to and where these buggers were hiding out. most of our fish came from slight humps or drops in 8-12 fow and we found some on deeper rock piles off of points or between islands.  up bright and early...can barley see through the fog   some walleye         whats a northern Ontario fishing trip without a shore lunch!   delicious fresh walleye!   went to a near by smallmouth lake and smashed them on tubes and poppers     some scenery pictures    I would definatly go back to fish this lake next time I have a chance. the walleye fishing was outstanding once you were able to locate them. I would love to go there when they are actually ""on fire"" and feeding more actively!  mike"
