806446,can u fish,2013-09-05 02:20:00,326,The waiting is over heading to Chapleau in the morning for a Fly in with Parks into the Chapleau game preserve will be flying into Abbey Lake for some much needed rest and what I am sure is going to be an awesome fishing trip I would like to thank Mike Borger for all the info he had given me on this particular outpost camp the way I see it if Mike has been there you can not go wrong will be spending Thursday night in a motel and then loading up the beaver for an early flight out Friday morning for 7 days in will post a report when I get back hoping the Sultan road is in decent shape this time of year.  Cheers....
