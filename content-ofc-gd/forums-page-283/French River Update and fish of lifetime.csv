805919,Muskieman,2013-09-01 03:50:00,2472,"As for weight ( please nobody throw rocks at me ) I would hazard a guess and think it's safe to assume 43-46 lbs ,maybe more , without the girth nobody knows ... really .. it doesn't matter ! It's without a doubt a nuclear sub !"
805922,Joey,2013-09-01 04:26:00,9122,"Well congratulations, that certainly is a fish of a lifetime.  What a beauty!!!"

805956,adempsey,2013-09-01 19:02:00,1498,"What a brute!  I think we need to cast that as the star of Muskynado!   (Feel free to steal that name for one of your musky baits.  You're welcome, lol.)  Cheers to the guys who helped you out too."

805839,sneak_e_pete,2013-08-31 20:53:00,540,"Hi all...just back from the French River, Wolseley Bay.  Fishing was great.  Only 1 walleye all week despite lots of trying, but the bass and pike were definitely on.  Nothing massive, but lots of them.  On my second night there, I got this beauty.  Disclaimer: I am not a musky fisherman...in fact this is the first I have gotten.  I don't target them...and yes this was a total fluke catch!  I tried my best to handle her properly and she swam away beautifully.  I was trolling a weed bed with a #3 Mepps Aglia (thanks Big Cliff for the tip    ).  She hit like a freight train.  After about 10 minutes I got her to the boat.  I had drifted to shore and got out in a couple feet of water to handle her.  A couple quick pics and a tape measure and back she went. She measured 56""   .....any guesses on weight?     "
805840,Rich Clemens,2013-08-31 20:55:00,3131,Simply awesome  !!!   Congrats
805841,mattyk,2013-08-31 21:03:00,2110,That is a fish of a life time! Congrats!
805843,sneak_e_pete,2013-08-31 21:14:00,540,"Thanks.  I had it in my original post...but must have deleted it....but I have to give a shout out too.  There I was with this monster on my line....not knowing what to do...no camera, etc.  I flagged down a passing boat.  It was a couple of young guys who admitted that they were scared I was OPP busting them for not wearing their life jackets.  They took the photos of the fish for me.  I gave them my email and they promised to send the pics.  I was so frazzled, I didn't even get their names.  They could of done nothing, but they followed through and helped me remember this moment.  If they happen to read this...thank you!"
805846,lew,2013-08-31 21:30:00,12766,"If your gonna start musky fish'n, you may as well start with a 56"" brute like that, congrats on getting her, she's a true trophy !!"
805848,Sinker,2013-08-31 21:34:00,8692,Wow!! Nice one for sure!!!!  S.

805852,Handlebarz,2013-08-31 21:50:00,3790,Totally killer congrats for getting that awesome musky. Like Lew said that's a good way to start into musky fishing.
805853,Skud,2013-08-31 21:53:00,739,Massive fish with a massive head. Nice!
805854,Big Cliff,2013-08-31 21:57:00,6899,"Well, I did say don't worry about the size of the bait (among other things) LOL. Now I feel bad because you are probably going to have to fish a life time to match that catch. Congratulations!  Now, without spilling the beans, did you catch it and most of the pike doing what I suggested?"
805856,BillM,2013-08-31 22:08:00,17367,"Wow, that thing is a giant!   That's easily a 40lb class fish."
805857,sneak_e_pete,2013-08-31 22:08:00,540,Big Cliff...I did exactly what you said...so yes

805862,irishfield,2013-08-31 22:33:00,26272,Look at the massive head on that beast! Too bad you didn't get a good shot of her.. but you're hooked now buddy !!! lol
805864,Cast-Away,2013-08-31 22:40:00,790,"Man what an unbelievable fish! I would be shaking in my boots holding that monster, congratulations!"

805869,esoxansteel,2013-08-31 23:05:00,1307,"A incredible musky, and absolutely gorgeous, you have set the bar very high for yourself to beat, congradulations"
805870,leaf4,2013-08-31 23:17:00,2466,"What a catch! my co worker is up there right now, he was telling me he was going to shoot for musky I laughed and told him he better pick up a new rod and reel because he has 8lb test and an ugly stik and that's it haha. seeing all these wolsley bay reports ill have to make it up there best year for a trip looks like a great place.  nice job!"
805877,spincast,2013-08-31 23:55:00,3279,wow great fish and awesome story. Fish of a lifetime for sure. I guess you know where all the walleye went.
805880,spinnerdoc,2013-09-01 00:18:00,556,Wow that's a brute dude.congrats. being a fluke were you fishing with mono line? If so that would make it even  cool the line not snapping.

805884,wormdunker,2013-09-01 00:39:00,1711,That is a cow!!  Congratulations.
805887,Pigeontroller,2013-09-01 00:45:00,2793,"Wow, great Muskie! 40 lb. neighborhood.  Great job with the release, without a pardner and proper Muskie release gear you did the best thing you could, you went into shallow water and got in with her..."
805890,glen,2013-09-01 01:01:00,2641,Look at your hand and compare it to the head.   The head is huge.  Congrats.
805910,Jds63,2013-09-01 02:24:00,1365,"congrats, what a giant !"
