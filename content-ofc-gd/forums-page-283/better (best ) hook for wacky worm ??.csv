806304,ROOK,2013-09-04 11:17:00,55,Heard so much about the wacky worm technique off this site. was finally trying out a wacky worm rig with moderate success ... BUT.... kept finding the fish really swallow down the hook even though I thought I set the hook quite quickly when I felt them take itended up that after a few fish  I bent the barb down to effect an easier release - was using some sort of 3/0 standard worm hook (sort of long shaft)is there some hook that is better than others to try and prevent this from happening on a regular basis ????HELP !!!!!!!!!Rook
806305,Rich,2013-09-04 11:24:00,3927,"I use Gamakatsu ""Demon Circle"" hooks for wacky rigging, the circle hook gets the corner of the mouth the vast majority of the time."
806306,bobogo,2013-09-04 11:55:00,76,"I use gamakatsu size 2 octopus hooks. They're kinda the same hooks as the demon circle rich mentioned. Every now and then they might get hooked deep but i find removing these hooks are pretty easy. Everybody should learn the through-gill hook removal. If you haven't, that's probably the most important fishing skill I know. http://www.lunkersunlimitedwi.com/Hook_Removal.html (if you didn't know)  Good luck!"
806316,Angler management,2013-09-04 12:55:00,280,"Recently tried the power team lures ""sick stick"" worm and the shakey head rig hooks, and they have become my favorite setup. The action they give is really unique and i recommend everybody gives them a try. Has been a really successful technique for me and i think a lot of bass guys would love it. Also got a few really nice eyes this year on them as well on top of weed beds."
806324,Dave Bailey,2013-09-04 14:06:00,1641,"Another vote for circle hooks, I haven't had a gut hook on one yet."
806334,mattaw,2013-09-04 14:48:00,162,"I use the Trokar Wacky Weedless hooks, but bend down the barb. I find removing them is easy and quick. I also almost never get the dreaded gut hook (once in a blue moon)."
806335,gordy28,2013-09-04 14:50:00,638,I really like the Gamakatsu Wide Gap finesse hooks I use #2 for 4 inch worms and #1 for 5 inch worms Pricier option ($11 - $12 for 25) but I find they provide the best hook up ration Have also used Octopus and Circle hooks successfully without any gut hooks
806339,Lape0019,2013-09-04 15:26:00,647," I cannot say enough good things about the sick sticks. They work amazangly well and have literally been the reason for me not being skunked once this year. I use the 1/16 oz weighted Buckeye Flick-it hooks with them as this is all that I could find it the store I frequent. I cannot complain about these hooks at all and all of my hooks have been set within 1 inch of the lip. The weed Guard on the other hand just seems to get in the way so I cut it off.  All I can say though is that if you are getting moderate success, keep at it a little more and try with a weighted hook. I bought these worms and hooks last year and tried it once. It did not produce. My buddy outfished me 2 to 1 the first time we were out with this technique (I was using a weightless tube) so I decided to give it another try and boy am I happy I did.  The extra weight makes the worm almost bend in half when you flick the rod and when the lure is falling, it makes the worm shimmy (for the lack of a better word) to the point where the fish cannot resist.  I have gotten in the habbit of ordering right off their site because they give pretty good discounts for bulk orders of worms (25Pack).  Adam"

806469,singingdog,2013-09-05 10:17:00,1047,"Any kind of circle hook will reduce the amount of deep hooking that is endemic in wacky rigging.  Almost every hook company makes a good circle-type hook. I like the Gammy and Owner hooks for wacky rigging, unless I am fishing deep, then it is the zappu inchi jigheads for me. It takes a bit of time to get used to the ""non hookset"" of a circle hook, but the learning curve is pretty fast."
806473,ROOK,2013-09-05 11:01:00,55,a huge THANKS to all those who replied - this site is awesome ( as always ) best be going shopping for different hooks now !!!! GREAT article on the hook removal as well - will keep that close to me !!! Rook
806549,dylan21,2013-09-05 21:05:00,22,I use the gamkatsu finesse wide gap weedless for my wacky worm setup. http://www.gamakatsu.com/fishing-hooks.php?pid=1037  they are great for fishing in the weeds and everywhere. Or you can also try their wacky worm hook called the wicked wacky. http://www.gamakatsu.com/fishing-hooks.php?pid=1047
806558,nexstar,2013-09-05 21:54:00,63,I use the Gamakatus wicked wacky too. Awesome wacky hook. Make sure you get the O ring too or you are only going to average 1 fish per worm.
806572,DropShot'r,2013-09-06 00:31:00,62,I also use Gamakatsu Wide Gap Finesse hooks.
806598,singingdog,2013-09-06 10:20:00,1047,"I find that a better alternative to the o-ring is to use shrink wrap tubing. With o-rings, the worm will still get thrown in a good fight....no better than getting torn in half. Using shrink wrap tubing, I have used the same senko to land over 20 good sized smallies."
806602,ROOK,2013-09-06 11:46:00,55,Shrink wrap tubing ????   is that like heat shrink tubing that you need a hair dryer for when splicing electrical wires together ????   hmmmm sounds like an idea !!!!!!!!!   where does one go about buying that type of stuff ???? thanks for the tip !!!!!!!!!
806655,bare foot wader,2013-09-06 19:58:00,1354,you can find clear heat shrink tubing at most electrical stores...I got some at the source
806660,fishindevil,2013-09-06 20:53:00,6254,"I just use the little senko rubber ""O"" rings and if my senko does get ripped in half I will save them and re-use them as sometimes a half senko works incredible believe it or not"
806674,aplumma,2013-09-06 23:16:00,6896,I use a shakey head and found that most of the hook ups are near the lips. The fish has to inhale the bait from the bottom and gravity seems to help. I will also use a circle hook when fishing it unweighted..   Art
