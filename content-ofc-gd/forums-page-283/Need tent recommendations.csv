790659,fishing n autograph,2013-06-05 19:14:00,2540,"Yup that's the one I bought. There is a flap at the base of the tent that opens up about 6"" from the ground. It's a great tent and nope we didn't wake up wet. A little stuffy but that's because my wife ""insisted"" that the windows be closed lol. I wasn't gonna argue on her first camping trip  "
790663,Fish4Eyes,2013-06-05 19:28:00,1022,"Glad you had a good experience with it. Can't go wrong for the 160$ it costs, not to mention superb Costco customer service if you did have to return it. Did it rain at all during your trip? If so, did it leak? "
790719,SirCranksalot,2013-06-06 00:41:00,3291,"I'm not sure how much camping you are planning on doing, but if you intend to go frequently I would recommend to spend the extra $ on a 'higher end' tent such as a Eureka.. Some good tents have just mesh for the walls and rely on a good fly for the rain. Lot's of ventilation if that's your main concern. And, BTW, the 'ground' sheet goes on the inside to keep your backs dry, not outside to protect the tent floor from abrasion as is too commonly done."
790722,craigdritchie,2013-06-06 01:03:00,1586,"Far and away the best tent available, bar none.  << link >>"
790778,solopaddler,2013-06-06 10:03:00,8605,"  Really Harold? Several of my tents ground sheets have grommets in the corner integrating them with the external pole system. My Marmot ground sheet has buckles that snap into the outside corners of the tent. All of these are made to be used under the tent, can't do it any other way.   As far as the choice of tent goes I'll repeat what others have said, you cannot go wrong with Eureka. Quality product at a reasonable price."

Speaking of ""best tents"" I've been looking at Oz-Tents for a while now: http://www.oztent.com/oztentrange  They're just so grossly expensive it's hard to justify, but man do they look sweet, and rave reviews too.  http://www.youtube.com/embed/adVIQbUWHZk"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen>"

790825,SirCranksalot,2013-06-06 14:07:00,3291,"I have a similar 1 that came with the tent. I leave that at home and take a plastic tarp to use inside. Slightly bigger than the tent floor allows you to tuck up the ends to make a 'bathtub'.(In reverse, since it is used to keep water out. Even if it's not bigger you can tuck up the upslope end."

790854,schnipster,2013-06-06 15:40:00,3,if the fly doesn't no go to the ground forget the tent no matter what anyone says--rain hits the tent wall at an angle(to save eweight no tent walls are treated unless its a single wall expedition tent) so you will get wet..sooner or later depending on the tightness of the nylon weave--the fly needs to hit the ground and close to---I was just reading posts--and ssing coleman tents with fly that covers the roof only --rain rarely falls straight--in a storm...don't cheap out man getting wet sucks with kids especially---if you want to go high end I strongly reccoment the MSR mutha hubba--awesome light and bombproof --pricey and not made for kids though
790873,troutologist,2013-06-06 16:41:00,951,Last few tents I've owned were MEC brand. I think you get good quality for decent prices with them. Never had a leak in my Tarn 3 even when set up in waterlogged moss.

On 2, 8 night trips the tent saw a total of just 4 days rain. (2 on either trip)  The tent was stock on the first trip so did not spray it. This Eureka beads water like I have never seen growing up using various CDN Tire brand tents. I bought some Nik Wax waterproofing spray for nylon tents, rain gear etc...it's like a windex bottle and worked really good. One thing I noticed was the 4 main poles on my tent are Aluminum with a cable rather than Fibreglass poles with rope. I really believe this makes the tent solid, in wind gusts it hardly moved. The ""fly"" uses traditional Fibreglass/rope poles as I assume to keep the weight down on the top of the tent.  Anyway 5/5 on my first 15 days sleeping in it. No leaks even near the zipper corner. The high ceiling is a +"
806445,Tim Mills,2013-09-05 02:17:00,476,I have a 10 yr old Columbia Lost Lake from CTC that I use for canoe  trips. It was cheap and has performed well but is breaking down.  To ensure I stay dry I also use a tarp as a ground sheet inside.  If rain in forecast I also use a tarp over the top of the tent as well.
806571,Sharkbait22,2013-09-06 00:20:00,297,"Sure fire method of staying dry if your floor leaks ... and they all do eventually just like waders. Use a light weight tarp. MEC has a few. Use it outside during the day. I still use the ground sheet, which is a little smaller the the tent, in some places to protect the bottom from puncture."

It would be used primarily in the summer and not on backpacking trips. Anybody have any recommendations for a good durable tent that will keep me dry?

Anybody have any experience with this line of tent?"

790363,cram,2013-06-04 14:41:00,1733,"Eureka makes a great tent, and they're usually not that expensive relative to other higher-end tents.    Also have their manufacturing or distribution center in Burlington, in case there's ever a problem.  Assume they may have factory sales as well."
790369,lew,2013-06-04 15:17:00,12766," I agree with Eureka, I had a 12x12 for years and it was excellent.  Very light, easy to set up and even in the heaviest rains it never leaked a drop. The top of the tent was all zippered flaps that could open completely for ventilation or keep them closed if you preferred."
790372,ADB,2013-06-04 15:33:00,444," Took the words right out of my mouth.  When I worked at Le Baron we sold a ton of Eureka tents. Other bands would get returned occasionally, Eurekas hardly ever. Exactly what Cram says, they're affordable, and located in Burlington.  Most of their products have a lifetime warranty as well."
790377,Fish4Eyes,2013-06-04 15:50:00,1022,Thanks for the advice guys.  Lew: did you find the 12x12 too big or just right for your needs? How many people do you typically camp with? I see Eureka sells a 10x13 and 12x14 tent.
790379,torco,2013-06-04 15:54:00,656,I can also add the chrous of happy eureka tent owners. best set of advice outside of brand is that for a tent to be good and waterproof it actually needs a proper fly that cover the whole tent and make sure the rains drains off of it.  Alot of the tents at canadian tire only have fly's that come down half way so your walls get wet and so do you.
790385,Woodsman,2013-06-04 16:28:00,1286,"Escort tents = no way, stay away, don't even think about it. BTDT"
790394,lew,2013-06-04 17:04:00,12766," The funny thing is I stayed in the tent by myself so the 12 x 12 was excellent. I like to have lotsa space, specially if the weather is bad. My brother was the same and he'd put a 12 x 12 up right beside me.  My wife joins me now on all my trips and has no interest in tenting so now we always rent cabins. I must be getting old and soft though cause now on those cold dirty rainy nights it sure is nice to be snug and dry inside a cabin"
790395,Fish4Eyes,2013-06-04 17:12:00,1022,"  I hear what your saying. My train of thought is that if the fly covers all the way to the ground, then there is much less ventilation and air circulation. You would wake up soaked from lack of ventilation and or scorch during a rain storm or hot summer day."
790401,porkpie,2013-06-04 17:42:00,2521,"I have had the Costco monster tent for years now, it is inexpensive, well built and well designed and I have weathered some torrential downpours without getting wet in the least, and frankly on some occasions I have been certain we would get wet due to how heavy the rain was.  I have had it at least 6 seasons if not more and I am completely satisfied!  Just another option!"
790414,torco,2013-06-04 19:22:00,656,If the tent is designed well this won't happen. My Eureka for example is all mesh on the sidewalls from about 12 inches off the ground. Plus the fly is built with vents and sits several inches off of the tent. I hope that helps.
790415,SirCranksalot,2013-06-04 19:31:00,3291, Very true about a well designed tent. I have a Eureka Mountain Pass XTC 3 person tent with full fly and no condensation problem. Sometimes I rise really early to go out and take pix--I leave my wife in XTC! .

If thats the one I was skeptical about it because it doesn't look like there is any ventilation as the fly goes to the ground? If that's the one, did you wake up damp from condensation?"
