803930,woodenboater,2013-08-20 00:09:00,2277, Seriously ? That's kinda bush league.  Lakair may have spotty coverage in the back 40 but at least they don't charge for it and it's a good excuse to hang out in the office and listen to Leslie and Kevin talk about their winter geology work
803932,Rich Clemens,2013-08-20 00:21:00,3131,Interesting.
803933,Rich Clemens,2013-08-20 00:25:00,3131,"Yup.  I think it was like 10.00 for the week.  Other places that I stay don't charge the guests.   Even before I got my I-pad, Leslie let me use their computer any time I wanted - same at Rainbow Camp. Even on holiday, I still have to keep tabs on things back home at work.  So I really appreciated that"
803937,woodenboater,2013-08-20 00:52:00,2277,"It's not so much the fee (they should just bury it into their daily rates), it's them typing the password for you. That they don't trust me with the password would really bother me. ymmv"
804371,chrispyke,2013-08-22 00:04:00,51,"When I talked to Harald about the buffet and told him that we really enjoyed it.  He went into a long response that there was only enough people for one sitting and he couldn't afford to pay a chef full time and his exact words were 'I'm not running a charity'.  We ended up reserving for the fish fry at 5pm, we were not served until 6:30 pm....every other guest was served before us.  I won't be going back...sorry.  Bryer and Lochaven only for me now."
804769,F_ast,2013-08-24 15:55:00,154,"We had a good time up there, mainly because of the group of guys we met. Like I said, its a prime spot, but thats about all it has going for it.  The updates he is doing is not adding to the accomodations.  But he is re-shingling the roofs and building huge party decks on almost all the cabins.  Still plywood walls and floors inside.  I find Harold difficult to talk to and a bit condicending.  He likes to joke, but at your expense and has little to give back.  The other group we met ran into and issue with the docking.  They paid for a boat slip with power, but they didnt have enough space at the dock.  It wasnt a big boat but Harold didnt want to move any boats to the other side.  It took the entire day for Harold to finally move a boat so the other guys could park and charge their batteries.  But not until he went into a rant about being too busy to look after the little problems.  As for fishing, the pike seemed to be over running the prime muskie spots for whatever reason.  We caught about 35 pike on large baits, and managed about 15 muskie follows.  We only got one fish in the net (a 43""er) in the last 30 minuted before we had to leave for home; so that saved the trip.  But I have a sour taste in my mouth after loosing what would have been my new PB muskie boatside on thursday evening.  I have caught enough 50"" fish in my day to know this fish was well over that.  That one is still an ouchy."
804771,F_ast,2013-08-24 16:00:00,154, Harold did say that the large muskieCanada group is still going to stay at his place.  We talked about it the first day we were there.  Maybe he is confussed or maybe someone else changed their minds on the accomodations?
804773,woodenboater,2013-08-24 16:02:00,2277,"Wow, a perfect lesson on how to drive your business into the ground in spite of location,location,location. Must be other issues on the burner or maybe that's just the way he is."
804793,Rich Clemens,2013-08-24 17:10:00,3131,"Well, for the years we've been there, I can say that I've never had a problem.  Had engine problems once and Harold directed me to someone to get me fixed up.  Within a couple hours, I was back on the water.   Sorry to hear that others have."
804805,lew,2013-08-24 18:19:00,12766," Interesting that outta 15 follows, only one fish committed.  Were they aggressive follows or only  out for a look ??"
805127,Pigeontroller,2013-08-26 20:51:00,2793," There's no Muskies Canada groups staying at Wolseley Lodge, I can tell you that."
805438,F_ast,2013-08-29 01:51:00,154,"Had a few instances where the muskie would follow to the boat inches from the lure and litterally bump the lure from behind mouth closed.  I would say about 5 encounters like that.  All on different spots.  Mainly 30-40"" fish.  Another boat we met up with said they saw that too... kind of stumped.  The rest of the follows were all early morning; fish were fast at the lure by late on it then seemed to shy away from the boat.  Between 7-8:30am.  I chaulked it up to just missing a feeding window, but really not sure."
806989,Halusch,2013-09-09 20:14:00,3,"Dear Balsam Laker, The Wolseley Lodge is sorry and we like to apologize that you didn't get served in a reasonable timeframe. Due to the changes in our Restaurant/Dining room we made the error to have a free fish fry for our Camp guest from 5-6pm on Sundays and open the Restaurant for reservations from 5-8pm, As we like to cook everything fresh we couldn’t keep up to serve all of the customers at the same time. We changed the time for the restaurant to 6-8pm and the free fish fry for our camp guest stays at 5-6pm. ""Open Restaurant"" The Wolseley Lodge was the last Lodge on the French River & Area which operated an open Restaurant for the public, why did other Lodges closed that service many years earlier....? I’m a friend of a clear word and we don’t have to hide anything and are willing to answer questions of our customers. Operating an open Restaurant was a big commitment on our side to offer an extra service for many customers in the area. It involves not only a Chef on payroll, we hat 2 cooks, 2 waitresses and a helper for the busy times (+ 3 more fir the buffet night). Over the last 2-4 years the economy dried out and we had an average of 5-15 meals a day in the Restaurant besides the Fri-buffet. We had to change the business, we didn’t like it but it was not feasible to operate the Restaurant, and we don’t like to hear that from a bank manager when it is to late. On this topic I express several times that a Lodge is a business and not a charity, and my apologies if this offended you.  It bugs us a lot that we had to do these changes, but I guess many people have experiences similar situations over the 5 years in this kind of resession.  We are still offering for The Wolseley Lodge guests our All Inclusive “American Plan” 7 days a week and for our Housekeeping guest the Dining room is available on reservation only Thursday – Sunday.  I would like to ask everyone to come forward with a concern/request at the time you are at the Lodge, and we will try the best to find a solution. Please keep in mind owners like us are running 14-16h 7 days/week from May - October and we are only humans.  Harald Lutte Wolseley Lodge"
806994,Halusch,2013-09-09 20:42:00,3,"Dear Pigeontroller, Yes you are right 2 Chapters of Musky Canada are not staying with us anymore as a group with their outing. (For F-Fast:   I probably told you that the Musky Canada group is still staying in the Wolseley Bay area.)  The Musky Canada experience was quite interesting, we held up to our commitments and provided everything what was asking for by the Organizer. Again we would like to ask everyone to come forward with a concern/request at the time you are at the Lodge, and we will try the best to find an explanation/solution.  Both sides learned from it and its past now. For people not involved I would ask you to always see both sides of the coin."
807000,Halusch,2013-09-09 21:09:00,3,"Wi-Fi at Wolseley Lodge We decided for the the 2013 season to offer include the Wi-Fi service at the Lodge without any extra charge, and they arn't buried in other rates (rates haven't changed over the last 2 years).  We were not aware that some people have a problem that we are typing the password into their device.  We are not big cooperation with PR-management, IT-department, HR-mangament, Plumbing/electric/septic warehouse, Marina-workshop  etc...... But I have roughly 25 nails in my office wall with diff. heads and somtimes I mix them up... sorry"
807001,Angler management,2013-09-09 21:15:00,280,"If i drove 5 hours towing a boat, and spent well over a thousand dollars for a fishing trip, i would be pretty ticked off not being able to charge my trolling motor batteries for next days outing. Especially if i booked a dock with power... Nevermind being given attitude and made feel like i was inconveniencing the lodge for my request. If you ask me, those are not little things to be bothered with considering its a ""fishing lodge"". One that a lot of people save up for one year or more in order to afford. Really cant see the other side of the coin on this one. Sorry..."
807017,Rich Clemens,2013-09-09 23:52:00,3131,I can remember lugging my battery back to the cabin each evening for charging - but that was different places.
807018,Rich Clemens,2013-09-09 23:53:00,3131,The north channel of the French is producing.   Three over 40 in the past 4 days
807025,woodenboater,2013-09-10 00:11:00,2277,sounds like a good trip so far Rich
807026,Angler management,2013-09-10 00:12:00,280,Try lugging three 31 series batteries. Besides the fact you shouldnt have to do that regardless... Cant charge all three in one night with one charger. Glad to hear youre making out well tho!
807043,landry,2013-09-10 01:40:00,1005,That is the worst PR response I have ever seen. Apologizing while justifying your actions is the worst way to make amends or get new customers. It sent red flags up for me.
807045,Richie Razor,2013-09-10 01:53:00,536,"I'm sorry, but I've never been here, but from the OFC reviews and response from the lodge owner, I'd have to say that this place needs to rethink their strategy on how to service their customers better, plain and simple.  My advice to the owner would be to visit a resort like taboo or deerhurst - see how they cater to their clients - this is the attitude and professionalism your customers expect when doling our the greenbacks for a vacation. Most of your customers are professionals, have the moolah to spend, and just want a decent time. If you have a problem with recognizing who your market is, and have trouble servicing them, then perhaps you should exit the business.  Good luck."
807061,Bruski,2013-09-10 05:20:00,5,"Yea, and it latterly goes down hill from there. A family member warned me about the new owners of Wolseley Lodge (specifically Harold) and basically said 'watch your back'. The previous owners of Wolseley Lodge were great according to my friend as well.  I've stayed at a hand full of lodges over the years and never saw such bad owner interaction to date. I personally didn't have any direct run in's with Harold, but those around me did and I saw it first hand. The food was ok until some stuff ran out, beer ran out and the cottage we stayed in was crampt and water stunk like sulphur (needless to say, I didn't shower all weekend).  The following year I stayed at Totem Point and it was like haven and I would go back without question. Tonnes of food, large cottages, great owner hospitality and a warm shower!"

802090,sneak_e_pete,2013-08-07 17:22:00,540,"Hi all, hope everyone is enjoying their summer.  I am heading up to the French in 2 weeks.  Haven't been there in a couple of years and have not fished this particular area of the river.  Staying at Totem Point Lodge on Wolseley Bay.  This is my only trip this year, so want to make the most of it!  I have tried to do some searching on fishing tips and to be honest, the stuff I have found has not been very favourable about the fishing in that area.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.  Happy to receive locations by PM if preferred  There are no minnows available, but will be bringing cranks and worm harnesses for weed edges and jigs and drop shots for deeper water.  Thanks in advance!"
802092,Headhunter,2013-08-07 17:55:00,5703,"Hey Pete, I was up in that area from July 13-20th of this year. That was the week of the heat wave and fishing was tough all week, except the thursday, when the front went through. We stayed at Moonlight Bay Cottages, just outside of Alban, which is only a few KM's from where your going. Smallies seemed to be the only fish willing to cooperate consistantly. Water levels were at their norm for this time of year. The deer flys were murder during the day and the usual skitters and black flies as evening arrived. Our week turned into more of a family vacation, then a fishing trip. The heat was too much, even early in the day. We did have a blast and plan on going again next year, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a fishing destination. HH"
802110,woodenboater,2013-08-07 20:08:00,2277,"Have been to both places and you're going to enjoy your stay. Not as fancy as Wolsley Lodge or Moonlight but I found it very charming. Didn't venture to Chaudiere and hung around area around Cranes. Found bass in this vicinity (5 Fingers etc). Pike avoided my offerings when I was there  have fun but mind the rocks there, they're nasty on props."
802148,Pigeontroller,2013-08-07 21:46:00,2793,"Totem Point is a great place to stay, Silvia the owner is a great host! The food in the restaurant is excellent! I've only Muskie fished the area in the fall so I can't help much..."
802170,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-07 23:18:00,10439,"I used to fish that area the first week of August every year. Caught my biggest large mouth bass (7.5) and biggest musky (53 1/2"") up there. I usually found the bass up the Wolseley River in the slop and muskies were caught on structure and fast breaking shore lines and points."
802183,wormdunker,2013-08-08 01:28:00,1711,I stayed at Wolsely Lodge many years ago when Jules & Nicole owned it .  We did fairly well at the 5 fingers rapids for walleye.  They were excellent hosts every time we arrived.  She was a realtor from Sturgeon Falls.  Then some people from Barrie who owned a catering business bought it.  They were NOT the nicest people I have dealt with.  I heard they sold out.  Does anyone know where to locate Jules & Nicole.  I'd love to meet up with them again.
802191,sneak_e_pete,2013-08-08 01:50:00,540,"Thanks for the replies....I can always count on this board to help out.  Been through a lot of stress this year, so even if I don't catch much, the scenery will be amazing."
802194,woodenboater,2013-08-08 01:58:00,2277,"The gazebo off the games room is where you'll probably spend a fair bit of down time and inevitably fall asleep  nice view from there up/down the bay. fwiw, I found the crowd there pretty cool and laid back  enjoy your trip !"
802253,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-08 12:09:00,1022,If you want to venture to the West Arm I could give you a few pointers for the walleye. Shoot me a PM if interested.
802258,bigcreekdad,2013-08-08 12:36:00,546,"Make sure you hit some bays (large or small) after dinner with a noisy surface plug. You might have some fun...As in muskies.  Also, throw wacky worms against rocks and sheer cliffs....smallmouth."
802264,mattybculp,2013-08-08 13:13:00,388,I did well in the north channel for muskie ! There is a lot of water that looks good. I found my self always trolling from spot to spot while looking for good structure. Cant really help ya out with walleye fishing as that isn't my bag but there are some brutes in there for sure !
803594,F_ast,2013-08-16 21:12:00,154,Anyone else going to be up there next week?  I will be at Wolseley Lodge from Tuesday 20 until the 24th.  Fishing muskie of coarse.
803602,bigcreekdad,2013-08-16 22:24:00,546,Going to at Cranes tomorrow for a week.  Say hi if you see us.....Green and white Alumacraft with Yamaha tiller.
803605,F_ast,2013-08-16 23:00:00,154,I'm in a black 20ft Lund predator.
803609,bigcreekdad,2013-08-17 00:30:00,546,F_ast  I can tell you from 25 years experience and tons of advice from the locals...you should never stray from 300 yards from Wolesely Bay for good muskie fishing.......trust me on this.
803618,F_ast,2013-08-17 03:24:00,154,We I dont know about that.  I have been fishing there for several years now and there is some awesome stuff around.   I have fished through that area only to have moved a few fish.  Maybe I just like fishing where there isnt any cottages lol.  But there are some good looking spots near by there.  There are spots that I make the 20minute trip for.... at 60mph.
803635,Rich Clemens,2013-08-17 10:42:00,3131,"Yup - there are nice fish right there in the bay.  The years I was at Wolseley, I never got one.  Had a nice on once - but just briefly.  Patsy hooked into her first one ever in the bay, but lost her after a brief fight"
803659,chrispyke,2013-08-17 13:50:00,51,"We were up 2 weeks ago and raised 3 musky...none in Wolseley Bay.  In the spring, when we were stay at lochaven, someone caught a 47 in the small channel to Resolute Rapids.  They are all over.  I've heard that Wolseley Bay is very good, just haven't seen one there yet, although haven't fished it much either...Always heading up river !"
803695,bigcreekdad,2013-08-17 21:25:00,546,F_ast....I was joking...just trying to keep you away from my spots.
803723,wildeye rainbow,2013-08-18 01:35:00,123,have fun F_ast.  And don't miss Harald's Friday night buffet.  Never seen a turkey on a buffet table look so good...    WR
803735,Rich Clemens,2013-08-18 12:36:00,3131,Second that.   Good feed and never left hungry
803752,chrispyke,2013-08-18 17:53:00,51," Harald's Friday night buffet is no more.  He only serves to the public on Fri, Sat, Sun by reservation only with 3 choices of entree on the menu.  Imo that place is going downhill quickly !"
803802,F_ast,2013-08-19 01:24:00,154,"Its in a prime location.  Thats what keeps me there.  I have been there 8 years straight and some years more than once a season.  I tried the Brier just up the river a little but the docking is not that great for my boat.  As for the fishing, I seem to always do well up there.  Supprised Harold doesnt have any of our muskie pics up on his wall of fame.... but we do have a picture up there of a 90lbs sturgeon on my buddies lap we caught fishing for muskie.  Hope we get into one of the monsters I have seen in the last few years... and shes always on the same spot!!!"
803866,Rich Clemens,2013-08-19 16:41:00,3131,"I have been there quite a few times over the years and may very well return some day. They are working on remodelling and updating the cabins - trying to do a couple or so a year. They've done a few other upgrades as well.  Why are you indicating that it's going downhill ? Is the fact that they stopped having the Friday Buffet the only reason ?  Just curious for my own knowledge  - that's all.   Shoot me a PM if you like.  Couple new things from Wolseley that I ran into last year. 1 - There new dock has Hydro right there and there is an extra charge to request that docking there.  (somewhat limited space). 2 - They have Wi-fi now, for which there is a charge to use.  (Harold actually enters the password for you - in your device).  "
803927,Pigeontroller,2013-08-19 23:53:00,2793,"I was with a large group, between 40-50 at Wolseley Lodge 2 years ago...Everyone felt they were treated badly! I have never seen such bad treatment of guests anywhere.  We now go to Totem Point."
