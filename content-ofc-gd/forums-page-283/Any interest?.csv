804798,davierooney,2013-08-24 17:30:00,10,"NorthernPike thanks for the heads up, I have a ST CROIX 9' spinning rod, all my other gear is for fly fishing so hopefully that will do. I will pick a few cleo's before hand. again thanks for the info looking forward trying to catch my first Canadian Salmon."
804803,Christopheraaron,2013-08-24 18:02:00,3525,"9ft is perfect, if you have the choice get some moonshine spoons too."
806540,Christopheraaron,2013-09-05 19:37:00,3525,"just a reminder to everyone that it's this saturday! Also, if anyone will be coming through the K/W area with room for one more let me know please"
806596,tater0025,2013-09-06 09:29:00,12,I'd be interested in going Saturday. I'm from the k-w area and would like the company for the drive down.
803667,Christopheraaron,2013-08-17 16:09:00,3525,"Was thinking of hosting a pier fishing tournament for salmon in the next couple weeks. It would be small with 10-30 participants, probably about $20 entry fee. I think bronte would be the best location since its close enough to the major cities and its a big pier with lots of fish. Obviously it would be run at night, probably 9 to 1 or 2 am. Would anyone on here be interested?"
803681,Rich,2013-08-17 19:17:00,3927,"Will marshmallows be available at the pier?  I'd be interested, depending on the work situation at the time."
803682,e-z-out,2013-08-17 19:18:00,1052,Count me in have always wanted to give it a try
803683,Christopheraaron,2013-08-17 19:32:00,3525,"Lol, we'll I know the ministry discourages the use of bait so I think it would be lures only, but I suppose you could tip a spoon with one!"
803684,Rich,2013-08-17 19:42:00,3927,"No bait, k. Earplugs it is.  Joking of course. Any salmon discussion has to include the marshmallows. Lol"
803685,Christopheraaron,2013-08-17 19:50:00,3525,"lol, what about a weighted treble with 3 marsh mallows"
803691,misfish,2013-08-17 20:57:00,29133,"I would be in for a 5am start,end at noon,and wings and beers after."
803694,SlowPoke,2013-08-17 21:21:00,2984,Clearly you've never fished Bronte before. Wings and beer 7pm-9pm; walk across the street catch 4 30lbers and have 3 fist fights in 5 hours and your sober enough to drive home at 2am.
803697,misfish,2013-08-17 21:29:00,29133," Oh,,,,, to be young again .  .."
803714,redpearl99,2013-08-17 23:44:00,259,I will be there.... I'm to poor to participate but I can serve as the official referee
803720,Richie Razor,2013-08-18 00:56:00,536,"Lol fist fights over chucking metal or plunking marshmallows for the infamous ""boot""  Been there done that, not for me anymore. I hope people from here can go and take pics as the action is heating up down there so I hear.... Good luck!!!"
803824,Afraz,2013-08-19 04:10:00,250,"Hmm sounds, good. I Ought to pull out the Jet Boat and troll around just out of everyone's casting distance"
804519,Christopheraaron,2013-08-22 22:45:00,3525,"Well I contacted oakville and it would take 4 weeks to get the permit and cost about $200, I'm hoping that was because it's next to the marina, so I emailed mississauga asking about their pier, we'll see what they say. I'm hoping this will happen september 7, it's a little later than I'd like but it's probably the best I can do."
804520,irishfield,2013-08-22 22:50:00,26272,"LOL.. we use to leave Consumers Glass at 11pm off the afternoon shift (1984).. take our spots under the bridge, with our mickey, and fish all night. Oh the good old days.  Have fun Chris if you can pull it off... a tad too far for me these days. As for a permit.. to fish on public property.. hmmm"
804521,Christopheraaron,2013-08-22 22:58:00,3525,"Thanks, you can fish off of there, just running an event you need permission."
804523,Freshtrax,2013-08-22 23:03:00,2215,It's just a bunch of Internet buddy's that all showed up at the same time...no event..nothing to see here
804524,davey buoy,2013-08-22 23:06:00,5505,That's the way you spin it Christopher.Lots of fun and no worries .
804525,Christopheraaron,2013-08-22 23:15:00,3525,"alright then, 9pm on the 7th, see you there"
804528,Christopheraaron,2013-08-22 23:18:00,3525,we'll keep it at bronte too
804618,Freshtrax,2013-08-23 15:41:00,2215,"I unfortunately won't be able to make it I am Entertaining guests from overseas, but hope everyone has a great time."
804650,msp,2013-08-23 19:09:00,1336,That actually sounds like alot of fun ! I will start training asap
804664,misfish,2013-08-23 20:13:00,29133," Oh, if I went on that date,my parents would disown me. They are redoing their vows after 50 years of marriage.. Hell,I couldnt even get my pop to go golfing,and still have him at the church on time. I promised I would.LOL  Have  fun Chris and the gang."
804739,davierooney,2013-08-24 04:45:00,10,"hey Chris count me in, although I have never fished for salmon but willing to have a go if someone can give me a little bit of a clue as to what to use ?"
804782,northernpike56,2013-08-24 16:37:00,717,"Heaviest, longest rod you own, largest capacity reel spooled with 10-20 pound line, and a few little cleo 2/5 or 3/4 oz spoons. the glowing paint ones work the best. You can charge them with your iPhone camera but it's not necessary."
804785,northernpike56,2013-08-24 16:38:00,717,I'll also probably be there. Can't wait for our Bruce Peninsula trip in a few days too man.
