Told me where to launch my boat and where to fish and we caught fish.  He was just way friendlier than most and I just wanted to say thanks and let people know about this place as I have only driven by it a few thousand times and never stopped in before.  Not sure why I am doing this as most every bait shop the guys are great but this guy was just a little but better than most so I think he deserves a mention and a thanks. "
