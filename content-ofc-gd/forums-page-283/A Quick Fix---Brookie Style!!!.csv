805957,bigvenison,2013-09-01 19:06:00,15,A very nice report -- congrats on a geat day coupled with 2 exc trout --  might just start the fall brookie season next week myself
805958,misfish,2013-09-01 19:09:00,29133,"Awesome.  I love my float tube. Is that the older Cumberland? Mine has a nice 5 inch cushion seat,that keeps your butt out of the water.  Just enlarged the pic. Not a Cumberland."
805960,mattyk,2013-09-01 19:44:00,2110,Nice fish!
805962,Joeytier,2013-09-01 20:02:00,3990,"That looks ridiculously fun, and probably a little more comfy than a canoe."
805967,fishindevil,2013-09-01 20:30:00,6254,Wow !!! Nice fish ... The scenery looks amazing too !!! Cheers
805999,adolson,2013-09-02 04:05:00,783,Nice fish! I must get me a float tube.
806079,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-09-02 23:52:00,310,"Thanks for the comments guys. Yeah, my butt is in the water. Next time I purchase a float tube, I'll definitely buy one like the one that you have. I bought mine at Canadian tire 5 years ago when it was on a crazy sale. Regular price was 150$ and it was on sale for 50$. At that price I went ahead and purchased 2. This way, I always bring someone with me when I go float tubing."
806087,MJL,2013-09-03 00:14:00,2427,Nicely done!
806089,Rod Caster,2013-09-03 00:26:00,5784,"Smashin brookies with the Abu Specialist! Nice work, great catch"

806158,Richie Razor,2013-09-03 12:38:00,536,"Wow, nice brooks man. They sure look like some nice healthy specimens"
806343,mirogak,2013-09-04 15:37:00,387,Was looking forward to your Brookie reports ... love your fish pics man .... keep'em coming
806810,Walleye'm Fishing,2013-09-08 16:20:00,310,"Thanks guys, next weekend I'll be out chasing brookies once again. Hopefully I hook into a few males that are sporting their gorgeous fall colours."
