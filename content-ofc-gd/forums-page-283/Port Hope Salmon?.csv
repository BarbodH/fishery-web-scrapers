806325,KGTR312,2013-09-04 14:11:00,9,"It seemed thought that the fish was more active after midnight and right before dawn.  What setup would you guys reccomend in terms of rod and reel. Spinning reel, baitcaster reel, size if rod. I would like and all purpose Salmon rod for rivers and lakes. Budget would be $150 - $200. I really like shimano.  I'm curious what you guys use, please post."
806336,Christopheraaron,2013-09-04 14:54:00,3525,"Well I have a TFO 9' 8/9 wt that I love for the smaller streams, sadly it is out of commission right now. So for the moment I'm using a 7' mh rod with a shimano sahara loaded with 15 lb braid and a 10 lb mono leader. I prefer a longer rod, but this works fine for now."
806347,FloatnFly,2013-09-04 16:30:00,1640,"currently im using an 8wt loomis nrx fly rod, but a 9'6 spinning ml or m wil work perfectly fine"
806597,Stoty,2013-09-06 09:35:00,2910,- Float/noodle rod (9ft+) - Spinning reel with a smooth drag - 6 lb florocarbon - floats - split-shot - hooks - roe/flies for bait.
806603,redpearl99,2013-09-06 12:08:00,259,i found out during my last outing that 6lb is way too light.  2 salmon broke me off.
806604,Richie Razor,2013-09-06 12:16:00,536,50lb braid tied straight to the hook should do it. You'll be able to muscle in those brutes like a bass. And be able to flip them up on shore like the bass tourney guys do it.
806616,Garnet,2013-09-06 14:32:00,2056,I use a 8:6 Berkley Buzz Ramsey baitcaster 20lb braid and 12lb leader. Yes I can put the wheels to them.
806623,ch312,2013-09-06 15:28:00,1590," Not only would using 6lb test result in more break offs, it's a pain in the butt for everyone else on the pier when it takes someone a half hour to land a big fish. It's totally fine when you're at a quiet place with not many people around, but using such light line in a crowded area is just asking for headaches."
806653,highdrifter,2013-09-06 19:29:00,2534, Gawd you're annoying.  Just like your annoying character from Office Space with your dang 37 pieces of flair.
806657,misfish,2013-09-06 20:09:00,29133,So hows the chucking off the Texico rocks these days? Can I still access this spot? I got a few hours to spare while down in the big smoke in the AM.
806662,esoxansteel,2013-09-06 21:18:00,1307,"Seen a guy leaving the River the other day with personalized plates that said FLOSSER, and by the piece of junk he was driving i dont think he was a dentist."
806665,misfish,2013-09-06 21:23:00,29133,  LMAO
806705,Richie Razor,2013-09-07 03:35:00,536, LOL.
806739,chessy,2013-09-07 16:45:00,610,last night port hope police cleared out 40+ cars and 4 campers .. they will no longer allow you to park from 11 pm and 4 am along certain places . the huge place across from the fish cleaning station is no parking in those hours.. so be careful
806750,fishindevil,2013-09-07 20:49:00,6254,I can just imagine the carcass stench down there !!!! What a dump that place is !!!  I can't believe anyone actually goes there anyways !!! The carcass hunt is alive and well I see !!!!
805735,KGTR312,2013-08-30 21:52:00,9,"Hey,  I've heard of large Salmon in Port Hope in a river flowing from Lake Ontario, I'm not sure what the river is called but it flows right through Port Hope. I have never fished Salmon, usually my choice of species are Muskies and Pike, well at least this year. I'm also not educated on Salmon behaviour.  Are Salmon legal to fish in rivers/streams this time of year? If so, would you guys be nice enough to share some advice and tips on catching this specie. What kinds of lures or rigs would be best suited in these conditions and season? The first thing that comes to mind is fly fishing, but could bait casters be used, or spinning reels on Muskie or Bass rods?  Thanks in advance, Fish on, Cheers."
805743,Pikeslayer,2013-08-30 22:23:00,1443,"As far as giving advice, one would need to know the following; 1. What zone are you referring to? 2. Sport Fishing or Conservation tag?"
805745,KGTR312,2013-08-30 22:43:00,9,"Zone 16, Sport licence. I was just reading about float fishing for Salmon. Going to explore some other technics."
805747,Ralph Field,2013-08-30 22:55:00,1018,Muskie rods would be good.
805752,Twocoda,2013-08-30 23:07:00,4130,A baitcaster or spinning reel set up for chucking 10 plus pound test line with lures might just be the most fun you have ever had with your clothes on ...read the river regulations/ exceptions and understand them....Good Luck!
805754,esoxansteel,2013-08-30 23:12:00,1307,"Port hope falls in Zone 17, and Lake O falls in Zone 20, better off fishing the piers although they will be crowded, but at least you have a chance of catching a legitamate one, instead of a flossed one in the river, and that should make you prouder of your accomplisments at days end, flipping stcks with large capacity reels, are adequate, as well as the longer beefier spinning rods and 4000 series reels, 10 pound mono minimum, glow in the dark Cleos 3/4oz, Ping-a Ts if you can find them, canadian wigglers, Rapalas etc in brighter colours, will do the trick. The river will be loaded with campers, loogans, rednecks, asses, and white trash, and some Salmon, and rotting chinook carcasses in garbage cans, if you have a small boat, and fish off the river mouth thats even better, we use to troll Ping-a Ts off the rivermouths of Lake O tribs in a 14ft Sportspal canoe, when conditions allowed"
805760,KGTR312,2013-08-30 23:33:00,9," Yes my mistake. Your talking about the the pier beside the mouth of Ganaraska River? Thanks for the advice. I'm curious, are Salmon in the river considered a easy catch?  (EDIT: If i'm not mistaken your referring to Pier Credit)"
805761,Twocoda,2013-08-31 00:04:00,4130,"define ""easy""  a person may know how to play the lottery ...and if he wins...it was easy...but if he doesnt win....well ...he knows how to play the lottery....ill garantee you wont catch any ...if you dont go to the river and find out...  edit to add...welcome to the forum"
805762,redpearl99,2013-08-31 00:14:00,259,a big bell sinker and jumbo treble and you're all set!
805763,KGTR312,2013-08-31 00:15:00,9,"I just don't understand what you mean by flossed fish. I will take your advice and try my chances. I googled around I found this http://tinyurl.com/l6khwcs seems like the spot your talking about, pretty helpful guide to a novice like myself. Came across this video Thank you, this forum is very helpful."
805765,irishfield,2013-08-31 00:41:00,26272,Troll'in.. troll'in.. troll'in on the river !
805769,Pikeslayer,2013-08-31 01:15:00,1443, I was also going to offer up a translation to the YouTube video...But based on their intent on what they were planning on doing with the fishies would not be suitable content here.
805783,redpearl99,2013-08-31 02:22:00,259,that video was definitely not flossing... throwing a rapala off a pier into open water is fair game.  But please do translate the video!
805785,BillM,2013-08-31 03:07:00,17367,"J13's are great off the pier for early season salmon.  Best days I've found is when the wind is blowing, the lake is rough and the fish are eating anything that they come across."
805791,steelhead75,2013-08-31 06:59:00,35,"try some marshmallows , but dont forget the graham crackers,  hershey bar and a lighter just in case there not biting you can have smores lol."
805809,Twocoda,2013-08-31 14:16:00,4130,I could be wrong for Pikeslayers translation but if i was to guess he is probably making a reference to the condition of the fish held up on the stringer as not very palatable for table fare...but to each is there own i guess
805812,KGTR312,2013-08-31 14:35:00,9," They're speaking Russian. I speak Russia also but I don't  understand some of the words they're saying.  I will be heading down to Port Hope this weekend, I'll tell you guys how it went when I get back."
805816,BillM,2013-08-31 15:00:00,17367,"It's going to be a gong show down there, lol!"
805822,fishindevil,2013-08-31 16:06:00,6254,It's worth the drive to port hope just to get some entertainment during the fall carcass hunt !!!! Lol.... And you can capture some YouTube vids while you are there !!!!!
805941,Richie Razor,2013-09-01 13:43:00,536,"I highly recommend NOT going down there, what a gong show of rubes.  It's a fleecing fest, to say the least, many of them old boots are way past their prime, and the stench from the dead and decaying salmon will stick in your nose for days.  The whole area is a sad sight really."
806260,KGTR312,2013-09-04 01:01:00,9,"Just got back the other day from our adventure. We went to Port Hope and well there was a lot of fishermen, a ton. So not to interfere with the 'pro's we drove east to Cobourg to settle on a little stream where the Salmon was making it's run. It was amazing to see the Salmon swimming through a narrow shallow water way trying to make its way into the stream. I wish I could of filmed or took some pictures but my phone at that time was under 10%.  I wish I could say we caught lots of fish unfortunately that wasn't the case. We just weren't properly equipped. From not having the right rod to not knowing how to rig the roe. I later found out that the roe should be on the back of the hook instead of being buried in the roe. The way we rigged the rig was we had the mainline coming down to a #4 octopus hook with a roe bag and drop weights pinched about foot above the hook. We didn't use roe floats in our nets, we didn't know about them, so our roe was all was on the bottom.  On the other hand we had some bites, this is my first time fishing Salmon so I didn't know how the Salmon takes the bait. What we felt was nibbles, we managed to set the hook almost every other time but couldn't reel them in. I'm not sure if those nibbles were bites or the fishing swimming by the line and scrapping it, and us thinking it was a bite and trying to set the hook thus snagging the fish and it getting unhooked.  We're heading back this weekend and I want to be prepared this time and catch Salmon. If you guys have any advice or tips their all welcome."
806267,Christopheraaron,2013-09-04 01:25:00,3525,"If you're fishing on bottom you are almost certainly NOT getting bit, those are fish running into the line. Use the floats and disperse split shot down from your float towards the bait, starting about 1-2 feet from the bait. On a side note the other day I tried some of that atlas plastic roe and it worked pretty well, landed one and had a bunch on that broke us off."
806281,BillM,2013-09-04 02:55:00,17367,"Half the time you 'hook' a fish all you're feeling is the line running across it's back then your hook digging into it's dorsal fin, lol.   Fishing for salmon in the creeks is like shooting fish in a barrel.   Let them do their thing."
806285,KGTR312,2013-09-04 03:32:00,9, Yea that's what I thought. I talked to a few guys at my local fishing store and they told me the Salmon take the bait and it's noticeable. At the spot we fished there was more of a crowd at night and I noticed people using glow sticks on the tip of there rods. When the sun came up we saw anglers coming in with floats.
806321,Christopheraaron,2013-09-04 13:13:00,3525,"Most of those guys are bottom fishing, most of them probably snagging/flossing, trying to avoid any trouble by going at night."
