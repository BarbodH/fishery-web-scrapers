806029,FishOn,2013-09-02 18:25:00,136,Can I please get someone to recommend a good place  to have my Mercury 4 stroke engine diagnosed and repaired. I am in Markham and willing to travel a good distance if the shop is reasonable and does a good job. they have to be licensed Mercury technicians.  Thanks
806030,BillM,2013-09-02 18:30:00,17367,What's wrong with the motor?
806032,scugpg,2013-09-02 18:50:00,1373,if I had to take mine in I'd go to bay city marine in Hamilton. Worth a call to verify the mercury licensed tech part. Clarence is very good to deal with.
806041,Terry,2013-09-02 19:25:00,14456,I like top gun near bradford for merc engine repairs
806052,Pikeslayer,2013-09-02 21:05:00,1443,City Marine in Mississauga. Certified Mercury technicians. They are 2 minutes from the boat launch @ Promenade Park so you can take it directly to the lake for a test drive after service. Let them know Simon referred you
806061,nexstar,2013-09-02 22:35:00,63,I second Top Gun Marine for Merc. 
806063,FishOn,2013-09-02 22:52:00,136,"75 Mercury 4 stroke EFI. It starts hard and when it does start black smoke is coming out (from the exhaust mixed with fuel and oil) .  its like running an engine on choke only. To me it looks like its running only on two cylinders, but I could be wrong.I did some research and it could be a fuel problem with the Module fuel supply regulator. Apparently there is  a small 1/8"" hose that could crack and start sending too much fuel. While running the alarm sounded and I did shut the motor down. I am hopping there will be some codes stored in the ECU.  Anyways, the engine has set for over a year and it has less than 50hrs on it. I have to get it checked"
806065,FishOn,2013-09-02 22:56:00,136,There used to be a Mercury outboard shop around Steels and Dufferin are.Close to the 407 Head Office. I forgot  the name of the shop. It was a unit in a strip mall. Extreme something??? They worked on my Mercury Optimax  a while back  and did a great job. I will keep an eye on the post and see who gets the best vote and give them my bussines.  Thanks!
806240,FishOn,2013-09-03 23:24:00,136,Thanks to all. Solved my problem. it was a cracked vacume  hose in the fuel regulator module. Engine is running like a champ now.
806252,frodobuggins,2013-09-04 00:20:00,127,which place did you end up taking it to?
806280,John Bacon,2013-09-04 02:53:00,3277,"Central Outboard Marine on Woodbine north of #7 carries Mercury.  I bought mine there, and others have mentioned that they were happy with the service there.  A lot closer than Hamilton."
806282,grimsbylander,2013-09-04 03:00:00,3016,I know you've got it looked after but I should mention Xtreme Marine in Etobicoke for future consideration. Tony is excellent and extremely fair.
