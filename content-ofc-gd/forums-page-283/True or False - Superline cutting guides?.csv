A few years ago I re-did all the guides on my friend's G-Loomis fly rods after he came back from Florida. Apparently tarpon and jacks were the culprit.LOL  Never had any problems with SIC, alconites or aluminum oxide guides myself."
806768,okumasheffield,2013-09-08 01:16:00,318, Good to know Recoil will get cut.  I am only concerned about my salmon rod since I just start running Nanofil this season and the fresh chromes have been pulling it HARD back into the lake.  have not seen any damages yet but certainly concern if it will ever  None of my rods have Recoil on them.
