805635,Musky or Specks,2013-08-30 04:54:00,2710,I always try to include important info for noobs and I figured with Salmon Steelhead season just around the corner I'd post a tool that I started using years ago when I use to steelhead. Now I use it for river smallmouth and musky fishing to check water levels. It gives you the water levels for the past 4 or 5 days so you can tell if the river you want to fish is going to be prime or not.   http://www.wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/text_search/search_e.html?search_by=p&region=ON  Every water level reader in the province is included so you should be able to find your home water.  Used it on the weekend to finally find a creek that I had been waiting for the water level to drop and clear all summer. It resulted in my son and I's best day of smallmouth fishing this year and my best an 18 incher for this season   My boat motor seized on the weekend so if anyone can point me in a direction within 10 hrs of KW with some decent shore/bellyboat fishing(Any gamefish species) for the weekend I would be eternally grateful(PM's of coarse)
