806594,Stoty,2013-09-06 09:17:00,2910,If you have vision benefits... claim them. Can't beat free.
806607,Lape0019,2013-09-06 13:08:00,647," If you have never used them, you wouldn't know the difference. After using them, I will never go back to cheap sunglasses.  I have a pair of Oakley fishing specific straight jackets with Shallow Blue Irridium lenses that are 2 years old and still kicking. I just bought a pair of Revo Guide Small glasses with the shallow water lense and don't like them near as much as my old oakleys. I keep both on me when fishing though as the oakleys are great for overcast days and the Revo's work great when downright sunny.  When I used to buy $20.00 glasses, I would break them within a week. I usually end up losing them now before even coming close to breaking them. For the record, I have lost 3 pairs in 6 years so by the time I ""lose"" them, I am ready for a new pair anyway."
806641,BucktownAngler,2013-09-06 18:27:00,582,im sure once you drop a few couple hundred on a pair you'll take the extra effort/precaution to not lose or damage them.  i know i would
806642,BillM,2013-09-06 18:32:00,17367,Cheap and quality optics don't belong in the same sentence.   I'd gladly drop another $2XX on a pair of Maui Jims if I drop mine in the lake tomorrow.
806643,highdrifter,2013-09-06 18:40:00,2534, Doesn`t say that those lenzes are polarized.  Just sayin..
806645,highdrifter,2013-09-06 18:52:00,2534,"Furthermore, that original price seems steep for non-polarized lenzes."
806646,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-06 18:53:00,10439, That's because they aren't polarized. Look nice but useless fer fishin' Oakley has a bunch of non-polarized glasses. If you want the same ones but polarized add another  $100.  http://www.westmarine.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=945435&catalogId=10001&langId=-1&storeId=11151&storeNum=51066&subdeptNum=51084&classNum=51087#.UiokhH92mM0
806647,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-06 18:55:00,10439, Yes it is steep as most of the Oakley shades in non-polarized are in the $125-$150 range and the polarized are $190-$220 range most places.
806651,highdrifter,2013-09-06 19:13:00,2534,Sounds like highway robbery to me.

806676,Raf,2013-09-06 23:22:00,3495," exactly.  i used to buy the cheapo ones that i'd end up losing.  once i got my costa del mars, i was much more careful with them.. and i still have them 4 years later.  and they are night and day compared to the cheapos in terms of vision.  never go back to the el cheapos."
806677,lew,2013-09-06 23:32:00,12766,I've been wearing the same pair of H2Optics for 7 or 8 years now and their still in great shape. Never could understand why folks pay big money for things and don't look after them.
806678,muskymatt,2013-09-06 23:49:00,2608,I too had a pair of h2optics for about 5-6 years and they were awesome. Until I kneeled on them ice fishing  .dumass. I bought a pair of Bluewater optics to replace them and they are also quite nice. They'll last for many years with proper care.
806708,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-07 03:57:00,10439,I just added a pair of Costa's to my stable of shades tonight.
806711,Stoty,2013-09-07 05:57:00,2910," EXACTLY! If you buy a ""cheap-o"" pair for $20, you treat them exactly like that as well. When you realize that good quality glasses/lenses are head and shoulders above the cheap ones, you'll fork out the cash and MAKE SURE to take care of them. Sure, s##t happens and you could lose/break them but if you drop $200+ on a pair of glasses.... trust me... you'll take care of them as best you can.  I dont know about anyone else, but if I have a bait/hook/weight flying at my face at mach 3... I dont want to trust $20 plastic lenses to protect my eyes! Always remember... you get what you pay for."
806753,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-07 21:16:00,4399,Finally broke down and purchased some quality eyeware...Costa  man o war with the 580 lens. It's like everything is in HD.  Lets see how long it takes me too lose/break them.
806767,cynmar,2013-09-08 00:48:00,169,"Got a pair of Tifosi sunglasses at the local golf store. $134.  great polarized glasses, hard case with three different sets of lens and the lens have a breathing vent near the rim.  Love them.  Bill"
806855,davey buoy,2013-09-08 21:59:00,5505,"To keep with the topic,what do you use to clean the lenses?.Is there a all around decent cleaner?. That would minimize streaking or fading."
806857,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-08 22:04:00,4399,I plan on using the cloth and cleaner that I get from the optometrist.
805823,shadowfly,2013-08-31 16:26:00,84,Hey guys ive lost my good pair of H2O sunglasses that I got from le baron and they no longer have any or simmilar style best $50 sunglasses  so im currious to what you guys recommend looking to spend $50-$120 will be using them for driving and fishing  thanks in Advance
805824,fishindude,2013-08-31 16:27:00,220,Ryders You can find them at Sail or your local Running Room store MSRP for polarized ones go for $70 Nothing else in that price range that I know of with better quality
805825,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-31 16:39:00,4399,Try searching the site this subject comes up fairly often.
805832,BFSC Kevin,2013-08-31 18:55:00,1351,Gagnons were clearing out h2o optics sunglasses for $25 I believe? I recently bought a pair of numa and I'm happy with them. I did take some pics on my blog if you're interested to see how they look through the lens
805833,Dan668,2013-08-31 19:03:00,1120,"Costas are awesome, can find just above your price range on the auction site."
805837,shadowfly,2013-08-31 20:27:00,84,"I just came back from optic stores i did try pair of Maui Jim perfect fit and tint but for $480 is a bit hard since im unemployed at the momment , i tried costas just didn't like the way they sit on my face so for now have to find something thats half decent for $120 max  i just checked out gagons website they have the eyewear section empty"
805842,fishindevil,2013-08-31 21:12:00,6254,I have several pairs of Maui Jim's and never paid more than $180 I didn't know they went that expensive but regardless  I have had lots of brands and still do and they are still my fav but I have a few $50 pairs of strike kings and an h2o optics and I like those as well !!!! It's all in the lenses and you get what you pay for the Maui Jim's are by far the clearest sharpest lens that I have and they last too really good frames too
805876,danc,2013-08-31 23:53:00,4677,"Bottom line here is that everyone is happy with their brand of choice. Clearly your $15.00 polarized glasses from walmart can be beat, but I don't think that you need to spend 2 or 300 bucks on a pair either. For the record, I'm a fan of Skeleton Optics. Zeiss lenses, and when on sale are dirt cheap. Look them up and get on their email list. Lots of 50% off sales which will get you a set of good glasses for about 50 bucks."
805898,shadowfly,2013-09-01 01:38:00,84,didn't know zeiss made sunglasses gotta check that out thanks
805924,steelhead75,2013-09-01 06:41:00,35,"i have a set of spotters, from australia as i do a lot of saltwater flats fishing they cut the flats glare like no other i have found you can get into those for around 150.  as for maui jims i have those as well and love the fit. and i have never seen them at 480 sure you werent looking at the perscripton lenses."
805933,Peps,2013-09-01 12:35:00,191,Numa
805934,MCTFisher9120,2013-09-01 13:09:00,3761,"We still have H2O glasses ""some"" we are clearing out. For your price range the Numa's would be a good bet. Excellent warranty and quality made."
805938,Shloim,2013-09-01 13:26:00,515,I bought a pair of $50 sundogs from MEC and couldnt be happier... They work incredibly well!
805969,spinnerdoc,2013-09-01 21:02:00,556,I actually need a good pair myself. Welcome back my friend.

806129,Carp,2013-09-03 04:15:00,1488,"I have a pair of Hugo Boss sunglasses that I paid about $440 for. (Paid extra to get polarized lenses) The screws for the ear stems keep getting loose or falling out, so I found a new use for them. Keeping dust off the top left corner of my fridge. I have about 7 or 8 pairs of cheap plastic sunglasses from Princess Auto. $1.99 each. $1.00 when on sale. They work as good as some $20 and $30 sunglasses I've had and if I break or lose a pair, no panic, no tears, no cursing. I simply grab another pair I have in the car, boat or house and go on with my day.  I would like to fix and use the Hugo Boss polarized sunglasses, but no hurry, no worries. I know where to find them."
806130,Stoty,2013-09-03 04:19:00,2910,KVD Oakley's.... best glasses I've ever owned.
