806422,redpearl99,2013-09-04 23:57:00,259,  are you supposed to use a lighter to melt the netting?  doesn't that make the roe bag smell like burnt plastic?
806426,wallacio,2013-09-05 00:05:00,475,"I wouldn't bother, just grab some Spider Thread...give the bag about a dozen wraps, pull tight to cinch it and then break it off and you are done.   You can find it in almost any tackle shop, Canadian Tire etc.  http://www.redwingtackle.com/"
806442,Christopheraaron,2013-09-05 01:21:00,3525,"just use some white 6/0 tying thread, works well for me. And use a half hitch or whip finish to knot it."
806447,Burtess,2013-09-05 02:30:00,901,"No need to lift the aluminum ""holder"" to twist.  Open aluminum ""holder"", lay square of mesh over it, add eggs over mesh to depression in plastic base, grasp edges of mesh tighten up as you close the aluminum ""holder"".  Burn off excess with soldering iron (such as http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/6/Tools/WeldingSoldering/Soldering/PRD~0586305P/Mastercraft+25W+Soldering+Iron.jsp?locale=en).  Open and pull out completed spawn sac.  Thats the easiest way to do it.  Burt"
806454,Richie Razor,2013-09-05 03:16:00,536,"Is the baitmaker faster than using your hand and spider thread? Square mesh in palm of hand, spoon in roe, combine corners and twist, wrap with spider thread a few times - faster than that method?"
806458,MJL,2013-09-05 03:38:00,2427,"I use the baitmaker however I threw away the metal thing and just use the orange plastic base.  Lay mesh material over depression on orange base. Put eggs on mesh over the depression. Take finger and push eggs into depression (doing so folds the edges of the mesh upwards for easy grabbing). Grab the folded edges of the mesh with one hand and grab the other half (bottom end with eggs) with the other hand. Twist till you reach proper roe bag firmness and pinch so it doesn't unravel. Take spider-thread and wrap a few times (either snap or cut the spider-thread). Cut excess mesh material. Roe bag done. It's easier done than said.LOL  The guys at Tightlines do something similar except instead of using a baitmaker, they use a wooden board with about 30 depressions. They can do 30 roe bags at a time  I bought my baitmaker from Barclays in Oshawa when I was 8 after seeing a demo. The guy doing the demo used a soldering iron to cut away the excess mesh material. I just found it more time consuming to do it that way."
806461,Richie Razor,2013-09-05 03:43:00,536,A soldering iron seems a little excessive lol
806480,BillM,2013-09-05 11:43:00,17367,Cheapest 4lb mono you can find and a pair of scissors.   No need to use a lighter to 'melt' the remaining mesh...
806484,Steve Piggott,2013-09-05 12:44:00,196,soldering gun .seals and cuts.fast That what i use.
806485,Rich,2013-09-05 12:58:00,3927,"I cant see how a little gadget can make it all that much faster. I think no matter what, tying bags is gonna take time. Haha"
806504,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-05 15:22:00,10439, Yep. It's all I have ever used. I don't use the Melnak unit though. I use the Spawnee tying rig as it allows me to tighten up my bag better and I tie under the rig not on top like you have to with the Melnak.  http://www.fishusa.com/Product/Spawnee-Bait-Sac-Tying-Machine  
806506,BillM,2013-09-05 15:42:00,17367,Spawnee here as well Dave.  I've even got the old one my oldman used in the 80's   Still works great!
806532,JFish,2013-09-05 18:19:00,29,"I used to have the baitmaker but when u think about it I don't see how any of these machines could make you any faster.  My way is similar to the way MJL talked about in his post minus the piece of wood.    I lay some paper towel down (in case you break any of the eggs).  Lay 10,20,30 etc.. cut squares of netting down.  Place the appropriate amount of eggs in the middle of each piece and then hand wrap each sac with spiderthread (10-12 times) and cut the excess netting.  I found this way to be way faster then using the baitmaker."
806548,DRIFTER_016,2013-09-05 21:03:00,10439, Mine is my old one from the 80's LOL
806709,Sinker,2013-09-07 05:15:00,8692,"This is the only way to do it. I guarantee I can tie at least twice as many this way as any bait ""machine"". Those things do nothing but slow me down!  S."
806718,alexmedic,2013-09-07 12:22:00,186,Have anyone ever seen the lady at Angling Outfitters (Concord) use this?  She averages 1 bag a second!  Super fast!!
