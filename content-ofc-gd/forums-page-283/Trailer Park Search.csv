806349,tb4me,2013-09-04 16:37:00,3295,"Were at Coles point resort in Campbellford .. short drive from Toronto,on the Trent River, 3 locks down from Rice Lake. The fishing is excellent..As for Waterfront for 3 grand, thats what we pay for ours..However there are no waterfront lots left in the Park.. there are empty lots and he will rent you a dock..check it out www.colespointresort.com  Ask for Scott.."
806350,tb4me,2013-09-04 16:42:00,3295,"As for older trailers most have a 20 year rule...Where we are the rule is 20 years that doesnt mean you have to haul it out after 20 years it means that anyone ""new"" to the park cant bring in anything older then 20"
806507,ch312,2013-09-05 16:00:00,1590,"Jeez, all this talk of $3000+/yr ($500/month per 6 month season!)  for a trailer site sure makes the $500/year we pay for a creek side (15ft wide well known creek) site in a park with less than 100 trailers sound very nice. Not lakeside, but still decent fishing and the money we save goes towards fuel for the truck and boat."
806508,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-05 16:19:00,4399,You get what you pay for.
806559,fishindevil,2013-09-05 21:57:00,6254,"What Lew just said trailer parks used to be an affordable option to owning a cottage and now all the people with money have now turned regular trailer parks into resorts with $75,000 trailers !!! It's ridiculous now and it's all about trying to out do your neighbor !!!! They sure are not like they used to be !!!! And they used to be fun and great places to be but now there is so many rules and you can't just hire anyone to do work you have to hire their contractors and pay for every fee you can think of !!!! Go a little bit north out of the kawarthas and have fun and not be around the snobs !!!! You can feel like you are at a regular trailer park should be up in Haliburton !!!!"
806561,ch312,2013-09-05 22:15:00,1590," And in many cases paying high prices gets you nothing more than a tiny site, neighboring trailers close enough to spit on from your door, extremely busy facilities due to the high number of trailers in the park, park owners trying to pry open your wallet every chance they get, and the opportunity to park your trailer in a wide open area without a single tree for shade.  Shop around southern Ontario and you'll quickly learn that a higher price definitely does not mean better. For comparison, it's the norm around here to pay well over $2000/yr for a site as described above. I've literally busted out laughing after seeing some sites and what people are willing to pay for them."
806567,tb4me,2013-09-05 23:36:00,3295,"Yikes, what Parks are you going to? Our Lot is huge..Double wide driveway grass lawn 10, 100 year old oak trees on our lot alone..over 100 feet of water frontage on the Trent river..$2800 a year..This year we get hydro updates so we have our own meters..We will be paying our own hydro bills..That will bring down the yearly lot fees to $2500 for all that plus a quarterly payment to OPG for hydro..I can use my own contractors for whatever I choose.. the park has nada to do with renovations on anyones trailers.."
806569,lookinforwalleye,2013-09-05 23:57:00,4399,"Indeed my previous park had 3 pools, 2 tennis courts, lakeside restaurant, marina etc.etc. You don't get the above for 500 bucks...there are parks in all price ranges pick one that suits your lifestyle and budget."
805200,addy79,2013-08-27 16:34:00,573,"Friend of mine is parting with his trailer and I'm seriously considering taking it off his hands. Been renting cottages for years but the cost is getting too high for my liking.  Anyways,trying to find sites within 275km of Toronto where I can leave a trailer up for long term. Having a tough time finding much on the web and kijiji. Want waterfront, privacy, and willing to pay around $3000/year.obviously fishing is important.  Anyone know of some good resources that can help in my search??  On a side note, my friends trailer is a 2006 29ft Terry Dakota upgraded 830 model. This is all new to me, are they good trailers? He's willing to let it go for $9000.  Any advice/input is greatly appreciated!  Thanks!"
805207,DanD,2013-08-27 17:29:00,2223,I've been at a park that is owned by Castle Vacation Parks (Hidden Valley) for a number of years. Their rates are reasonable and the manager looks after the park quite well. http://castlevacationparks.com/ They own quite a few parks; there might be one that'll work for you. On the bottom right corner of the link you'll see a map of all their places.  Dan.
805209,Twocoda,2013-08-27 17:50:00,4130,Make sure all the mechanicals (stove refrig toilet furnace AC are working properly ...go through with a electrical tester to check EVERY receptacle ( wiring in these things can be a nightmare)....thoroughly check for plumbing leaks (again another nightmare to repair) ...look for any dicolouration on the carpet (indicates water leakage or used in cold months and not properly vented) If it has slide outs check the seals very closely by poking your finger all the way around to ensure proper sealing...these are just a few things to look for when purchasing a used trailer....we just bought a 5th wheel and are loving it ... we're not going to commit to any one spot as its our intentions to travel and fish with it .... but im sure you will have just as much fun planting it and using it as a cottage...enjoy!!! your gonna love RV lifestyle....Good Luck
805213,addy79,2013-08-27 17:57:00,573,Thanks guys! Good info.
805214,Garnet,2013-08-27 18:04:00,2056,You will not likely get water front to start. The park regular scoop them.
805217,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-27 18:26:00,1022,"You won't get waterfront for that cost. Like mentioned above, the regulars of the park will get the waterfront site. The only way I can see you getting waterfront is if you buy a trailer that is already on a site. In the Kawarthas, I have seen/herd figures of 5-6k for waterfront. I settled for lakeview for a fraction of what you are willing to pay.  Make sure that the park agrees to face the trailer in the direction you prefer prior to settling on a deal. I had a nightmare with this as the guy behind me was not impressed that my trailer  was partially obstructing his lakeview."
805218,addy79,2013-08-27 18:26:00,573,Really? I see. Do you know of any websites to help with my search. I thought kijiji would be filled with them but not so...
805220,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-27 18:39:00,1022,"Not aware of any particular websites, other than the obvious like kijiji. I noticed alot of trailer parks websites also have listings in them.  The approach I would take is narrowing it down to what lake(s) you want to be on, then you simply search trailer park and the lake name on google. That should turn up majority of parks on the lake. If you can, pick a park that is centrally located so you have good access to the lake.  Edited to add: keep looking on kijiji daily. Now is the best time to look as some people may not be renewing their seasonal fee for next year and will be looking to sell. There is some haggle room when this is the case as they are desperate to sell so they don't have to remove the trailer from the site and or pay another year seasonal fee."
805233,davew3,2013-08-27 20:30:00,430,"Try this place.   Had waterfront last time I was there, and docking.        Fishing has S & L bass,  walleye, pike and muskie.  Sawmill Bay Trailer Park"
805234,Big Cliff,2013-08-27 20:34:00,6899,There are several in the Kawarthas if you are interested I would be happy to put together a list of them for you.
805235,lew,2013-08-27 20:40:00,12766,"Alot of the trailer parks no longer allow older trailers on site, infact some parks are forcing those with older units out, so be sure of the regs in the parks before you buy or commit to anything."
805243,addy79,2013-08-27 21:55:00,573,"Thanks, I'll check it out"

805255,Pigeontroller,2013-08-27 22:43:00,2793,What Lew said...
805257,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-27 22:57:00,4399,Think long and hard about the investment...it's not a cheap endeavor when you add everything up. Easy to get in and difficult to get out...I am in Layzee Acres a guy in the park I knew had to get out of his trailer after two years and took a bath in at 40k out at 23k. They are not a easy sell when you want to get out!  Having said all that I love the park and I enjoy luxury camping...kingsize bed...big screen...central air and heat etc.Lol

805263,addy79,2013-08-27 23:48:00,573,This is a little concerning. I'm assuming a 2006 would Be okay with most?
805266,lew,2013-08-27 23:56:00,12766," Seems like some parks don't want anything over 10 years of age. As I suggested above, just check with the owners of the park your interested in and be sure that trailer will be OK there for a few years.  A friend of mine has been in a park for alot of years but his trailer is now 11 years old and he had to remove it from the park."

805276,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-28 00:21:00,8243,"For the price of a trailer and a few years, or far less than waterfront, park fees you can buy a small cottage on leased land on Lake Erie. Not waterfront but a cheaper alternative than a trailer and site with much better resale. A recent sale of a pals in laws was a 900sqft cottage at Featherstone Point on a private 50x100 foot lot for 30K, 3 bedrooms, living, dining room, bath with shower and tub, $1000.00 per year lease. None of this in at May out in October, fires out at 10 etc. It's your own private residence and lot. Need to be out for 8 weeks per year. As for the fishing? Phenomenal."
805302,sofabed,2013-08-28 02:31:00,119,A lot of the parks require you to buy the trailer from them and won't allow you to bring one in. I would check the parks you are interested in first before buying a trailer
805307,Twocoda,2013-08-28 03:47:00,4130,sounds like trailer parks are a pain in the butt...why commit to one lake or lot...there are wheels under the things ya know..enjoy em all!
