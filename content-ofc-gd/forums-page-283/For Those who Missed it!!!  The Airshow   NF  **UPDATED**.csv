806115,Joey,2013-09-03 03:29:00,9122,Thought I'd share some pics of the Toronto International Airshow that went to see with my son today.  Was great to see.  Always enjoyable.
806119,shadowfly,2013-09-03 03:40:00,84,Nice pictures 3rd one looks awesome what lens did ya use if you don't mind me asking?
806122,Joey,2013-09-03 03:48:00,9122,"  Thanks Shadowfly, I use a Canon 100-400 mm EF IS  Lens."
806125,irishfield,2013-09-03 03:56:00,26272,Thanks for making my day Hun !! Some of the Snowbird shots are priceless... and I mean that so be careful on the share. They're print and frame quality ! (and that's from someone with similar hanging in the house)
806126,Carp,2013-09-03 03:56:00,1488,"Great shots Joey ! I was down there with the kids today, but not a great view from our location. Parking was crazy as we showed up a little late. Usually we get there 1 hour or more before show time for a good spot.  Thanks for sharing."
806132,fishindevil,2013-09-03 07:19:00,6254,Awesome Joey !!!! Those pics look amazing I used to love going to the air show for many years !!! Keep up the amazing photography skills !!!! You should be freelancing !!!  Cheers.  Shawn
806136,Ice Fishing Ham,2013-09-03 08:42:00,83,Great shots - thanks for sharing.
806137,lew,2013-09-03 09:50:00,12766,Excellent shots Joey !!  We went to the air show for years but haven't been back for probably 35 years now.
806151,Joey,2013-09-03 12:02:00,9122," Thanks Hon, I've got tons more, I just did a quick edit of some.  Maybe I'll email you a few of the others after edit"
806152,Joey,2013-09-03 12:05:00,9122,"  Well it was my son's birthday so I drove downtown and parked near his apartment, then we went for lunch and then took the streetcar down and walked to the park.  Best decision of the day    Wow, thanks Shawn!!!    Thanks IFH.    Lew, I had also not been for many, many years.  It was really nice to go again.  It's very exhilarating to watch.  Brings childhood memories flooding back that's for sure"
806170,Twocoda,2013-09-03 13:52:00,4130,you nailed some beautiful shots Joey...very nice shooting!
806200,Jds63,2013-09-03 18:04:00,1365,"those are amazing photos ...  i remember witnessing a Snowbirds crash back in 1989 , that was horrible !"
806206,lew,2013-09-03 18:28:00,12766," It's interesting, but when that plane crashed and they gave his name over the radio, Shane Antaya, it always stuck with me, and even now whenever I hear about the Snowbirds, I remember that pilots name."
806238,FloatnFly,2013-09-03 23:01:00,1640,"those shots are awesome....got to see the snowbirds today as they flew over the school in whitby, i was fishing another creek and heard the roar, then saw the team fly right over our heads"
806251,Joey,2013-09-04 00:18:00,9122,  I saw them near my work in Markham too!
806254,fishingwithbob,2013-09-04 00:29:00,123,"They do a buttenville fly-over every year after the EX around lunch time.  They were a bit late this year at 1:30pm.  Too bad it won't last after they close the airport.  Tight formation, smoke on!!!!"
806263,bigbuck,2013-09-04 01:14:00,2449,Very nice pics Joey!! Been a while since I went to the air show.
806276,Joey,2013-09-04 02:21:00,9122,"Since I took a few thousand pics, I'm still editing them  Found these gems tonight:   Could their wingtips get any closer?????                  Even got the sun ORBs in this one!!!        "
