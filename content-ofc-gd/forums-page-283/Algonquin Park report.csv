806107,shimano19,2013-09-03 02:02:00,196,Awesome! Looks like some good fishing there
806241,ehg,2013-09-03 23:26:00,2666,"Thanks for the replies! It is the only place in the park where you can catch muskies, walleye and channel cats.at same time.    Wayne, the post showing your daughters strength and spirit faced with serious medical problems, really helped me decide to do do this. Initially both years i said i was too disabled to go. But buddies said we will do everything and take care. I just had to get to boat and fish. "
806242,highdrifter,2013-09-03 23:42:00,2534,"Nice to see a write-up from you, Erik.  Good info too.  Paddled part of the Petawawa into L. Radiant years ago.  I'd go back there in a heart beat!  Some nice esoxes there budday!  cheers"
806256,Rod Caster,2013-09-04 00:42:00,5784,"Oh man, that must feel great getting out there!  Looks like another great trip"
806746,ehg,2013-09-07 19:05:00,2666,"Thanks Fidel,  ya the Perawawa is a gem within a few hours of T.O or Ottawa.    Found this bone on our campsite thought it might be a moose bone.....but don't know? "
806773,Cookslav,2013-09-08 03:07:00,1457,"Nicely Done!  I have not done the Pett. But its on my list fo potentials. Gotta love those old Coleman stoves....mine still makes the tip each year.  Sure they are a bit heavy but nice and stable, dual burners, boils water in 3mins, and always starts  I missed this thread back in July....now I can't see the photos, you'll have to re-post them!"
713214,ehg,2012-07-10 01:55:00,2666,"Started a topic a couple of weeks ago wondering what was good food to pack for Algonquin considering no bottles or cans were allowed. Anyways, was well fed on this trip of 6 nights on Petawawa R. with an old buddy and his 17 yr. old daughter. We ended up having a fantastic trip despite the blasting sun and 32-35 degree heat. I didn't do much from noon till 6pm as heat and sun are enemy of MS disability i have.  Caught a bunch of channel cats and some musky and bass daily. Wanted to catch walleye but none were found. Did find a skeleton measuring 30 inches of a walleye so big ones are in there. Ate some bass which were as good as Kawartha walleye.  My buddy and his daughter aren't into fishing but still caught stuff. Here are some pictures.                  Great times!  Cheers, ehg"
713215,Live2fish85,2012-07-10 02:13:00,1633,Great Report. Good to hear ya got out and had a awesome time even with the health conditions.
713223,Joeytier,2012-07-10 02:31:00,3990,Awesome!  I'm sure the fish were just an added bonus.  I think I just put another musky destination on the list though!
713233,Moosebunk,2012-07-10 03:28:00,3970,Great little report Ehg.  Didn't know you had MS... that can surely be a pain as I have known a few in the same boat.  Some nice skis!
713235,Musky or Specks,2012-07-10 03:30:00,2710,Man Ive been wanting to do the Pet for musky for a long time now. Nice to see you catching some.
713282,johnnyb,2012-07-10 12:53:00,3413,Great work on the muskies    Looks like a fun time had by all  
713291,capt bruce,2012-07-10 13:21:00,820,"Good to see you getting out , some nice ski's dude ."
713292,torco,2012-07-10 13:24:00,656,great report. Didn't even realize the petawawa had musky!
713423,ehg,2012-07-10 19:04:00,2666,Thanks for replies.  Couple of more pictures were sent to me. Both these fish were kept for consumption. As there backs were turned unloading boat a snapping turtle ripped the catfish off the chain and by the time it was noticed only the head was left.   
713769,ehg,2012-07-11 17:46:00,2666,"Thought i would bump this since having to answer a few PM's asking for advice. Never used large baits. Just used jig with worms in 30ft. of water caught channel cats and a musky that way. Also caught musky, bass and channel cats on blue/silver clackin' raps, jointed shad raps and original Rapala. Caught a couple musky and bass on Kopper Live Target frogs thrown shallow. Hooking percentage was low but cool to see musky jumping at them.   Took a look at Barron Canyon since was on the road on the way. If was able to climb top of Petawawa cliffs probably would look similar. "
713793,mirogak,2012-07-11 18:39:00,387,beautiful river
713799,asdve23rveavwa,2012-07-11 18:47:00,2690,"Cool report, I also was surprised to see musky there.  Sounds like you had a good time."
713808,fish_fishburn,2012-07-11 18:58:00,1311,"Its been about 20 yrs since I have done that trip. It looks really low. Can't believe you didn't catch any walleye the river is polluted with them, and cats too. Going to have to do it again now. Thanks. Cats out of the bag now about the ski's"
713812,SylvanOwner,2012-07-11 19:08:00,266,Great report.  Thanks.  Been up that way a few times and although haven't fished much when in the area I can attest to the beautiful scenery of the Barron Canyon.
714293,ehg,2012-07-13 14:47:00,2666,Polluted with walleye there? Constantly targeted walleye but caught channel catfish and musky instead. Next time i will try night fishing and try to not hit deadheads littered everywhere. Like mentioned did find a 30 inch walleye skeleton so big ones are there. Great place to go!
714669,majorlifts,2012-07-15 14:17:00,171,"I truly miss our great fishing adventures , when my leg has healed you can be sure that we will be doing some serious Muskie hunting, oh and we definately have to find some good recipes for catfish, I'm all about that, fantastic post!!!!!!"
714682,Sinker,2012-07-15 15:08:00,8692,"Good stuff, Erik! GREAT to see you out on the water! Glad ya got into a few musky, as I know you like them, just too bad the walleyes didn't want to play nice! It happens...I'm sure you guys had a great time, regardless! Thanks for the report!  S."
714683,lifeisfun,2012-07-15 15:21:00,99,Great report and awesome pics
806028,ehg,2013-09-02 17:58:00,2666,"Was able to get back to the Petawawa R. in Algonquin this past weekend.     Last year went first week of July and it was hot and dry whole time but the muskies were biting. Didn't intend to catch them then but did.That was last year....  .....This summer went two months later in season and with cooler, wet weather the muskies weren't to be found. With the musky elsewhere all the smaller eating size fish were everywhere. Did catch fish to eat , which was the main goal. Everyday fish were cooked up.   A bunch of these were around, nothing big.   Lot of these as well.....    Caught bunch of channel cats which really tug the line around.    It was nice to get up there my buddy and his daughter worked hard as i am useless with this (SPMS) multiple sclerosis. At least with a little help can still get out fishing even  in an extreme wilderness situation.  Good times again there!"
806034,mattyk,2013-09-02 18:52:00,2110,Great report thanks for sharing!
806035,Joeytier,2013-09-02 18:58:00,3990,Awesome.  Thats a nice mixed bag of species in a beauty spot.  Those cats especially look like (delicious) fun.
806038,wildeye rainbow,2013-09-02 19:13:00,123,"Nice pics, nice fish!  I've got to put this river on my ""to do"" list.  WR"
806046,Moosebunk,2013-09-02 19:47:00,3970,Nice to see you out enjoying yourself this season.  Didn't catch the first report so glad you bumped it up with a second.  Lots of variety to play with by the looks of things.
806058,spinnerdoc,2013-09-02 21:35:00,556,Thanks for sharing. Glad to hear you getting out with your condition.  The markings on the musky on the last pic of your initial is amazing
806080,irishfield,2013-09-02 23:54:00,26272,Absolutely fantastic to see you out and about Erik !! And some great scenery to boot !!!!!!
