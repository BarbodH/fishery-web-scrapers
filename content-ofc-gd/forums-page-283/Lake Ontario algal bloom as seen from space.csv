806352,captpierre,2013-09-04 16:50:00,2521,surprised to see that on Lake O.  Where do all the nutrients come from all of a sudden?
806398,spincast,2013-09-04 22:33:00,3279,"This one wasn't actually an algal bloom, this time http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2013/09/03/lake-ontario-blue-green-algae.html  but recent reports indicate that phosphorous levels from untreated sewage and far run off are once again approaching dangerous levels in all the Great Lakes. Erie, as mentioned at the end of this article, had one earlier this year again."
806431,Joeytier,2013-09-05 00:13:00,3990,Thanks for posting that.  Shoddy unscientific journalism in that yahoo article.  Never heard of this 'whiting' phenomenon before...very cool
