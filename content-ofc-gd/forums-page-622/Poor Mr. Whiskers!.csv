511324,fisherman7,2010-10-12 19:21:00,325,"Here’s an email exchange between a potential buyer for my boat and me. I kinda figured it was a scam but played along for a bit. I don’t know why he hasn’t written me back. Poor Mr. Whiskers. ________________________________________  The first email from Russell  Sent: Thu, September 30, 2010 4:25:01 PM Subject: Request about the Boat on Craiglist  ** CRAIGSLIST ADVISORY --- AVOID SCAMS BY DEALING LOCALLY ** Avoid:  wiring money, cross-border deals, work-at-home ** Beware: cashier checks, money orders, escrow, shipping ** More Info:  http://www.craigslist.org/about/scams.html  Hello,  I'm really interested in your boat I'd like to know if the Boat is still available for sale, what is the final price and present Condition?  Can you also send me more pictures  Thank you   Russell Jefferson. ________________________________________ My Response To Russell  Hi Russell, the boat is still available and in excellent shape. As for the price, it's pretty firm as it's already well below market but I will take off $1k as that is what I would have to pay for winterization and storage.  Here's a few more pics. Let me know if you are interested in seeing it. ________________________________________ Russell’s Next Email  Hi ,  Thanks for your response. As you may know, I’m currently in Scotland, My client chose to purchase your boat for the asking price  as she is truly interested in buying it. We cannot make it down there and that’s why we made our decision based on the pictures, because we have been to Germany to look at a boat, and it wasn’t worth it as we didn't like it, to save me the travel and the travel costs, also I have made researches on the boat model, and I’m quite impressed.  We have concluded that she will purchase the boat and we are ready to finalize this deal as soon as possible. I will be in charge of the deal as I am an Asst broker. My client is ready to make the payment via wire transfer to your account, so please provide me with the following details so the funds can be sent to you. A Business account will be preferred if you do have one as she's will be making payment from her business account.  I will require the following details;  Bank name: Bank Address (your local bank address): Beneficiary Account name: Account Number: Sort code : Final  Asking Price:  Rather, If you want a Certified check as the mode of payment, Then please provide this details below:  Name: Address: Zip code: Telephone Number: Final Price:  After you have received the payment, our prepaid shipping officers will contact you and get the boat shipped to Scotland. . The shippers will also test drive the boat and conduct a detailed inspection.   Kindly let me know about any opinion you may have, and also send me your account details so that my client can make arrangements with her bank to send you the payment for the boat. After receiving the requested details, I’ll send you a sales contract.  Russell Jefferson.  P.S   Please feel free to call me:  ________________________________________ My Response – I don’t know why he hasn’t written back?  Russell, I didn't know that you were in Scotland, but c'est la vie mon amie! Do you like haggis? I'm very excited you are buying my boat and this could not come at a more opportune time. Our beloved cat, Mr. Whiskers needs a kidney transplant and it's very expensive. Apparently I am a universal donor but I'm not entirely convinced that the procedure should work. Still, my wife insists that we try. Are you married Russell?  I'm not sure why you wanted to know about ""any opinion"" but ok, here goes - I really think that Swedish meatballs should be banned from IKEA. I'm willing to bet they are not made in Sweden or touched by any Swedish hands. It seems to me to be false advertising. As for my banking information, it's attached and I've written it in Scottish so it easier for you to take to the bank. I agree that your shipping agent should test drive the boat. It pulls a little to the left but I've put a bean bag chair on the right to balance it out. Looking forward to hearing from you and do write back soon. Mr. Whiskers isn't looking too good. Warm Regards, Rob"

511348,Roy,2010-10-12 20:33:00,13728,Tell ol' russell to try to make the trip to Canada cause Mr. Whiskers also needs an ass.
511350,Rod Caster,2010-10-12 20:36:00,5784,Hahaha. That's brutal. Unfortunately some people fall for that.
511351,solopaddler,2010-10-12 20:41:00,8605,Was that really your response?  You're my new hero if it was LOL!
511352,kickingfrog,2010-10-12 20:42:00,8333,"The reason you haven't heard back from him is that his client has decided to buy my boat instead. Too bad for you, maybe I'll take you out for dinner when the money is deposited into my account... should be any day now. Do they serve haggis at IKEA?"
511353,mercman,2010-10-12 20:46:00,7054, THATS THE FUNNIEST THING I'VE EVER READ !!!!! You should be a stand up commedian.Mr Whiskers......
511356,HTHM,2010-10-12 20:51:00,4082,"Well played sir, well played....."
511357,ctranter,2010-10-12 20:55:00,543,Priceless.  Reminds me of when I started lookin for apartments in Toronto...
511400,fisherman7,2010-10-12 23:32:00,325,  Thanks! I do have my moments!
511403,Joey,2010-10-12 23:52:00,9122,Thanks for the laugh.  I think you should write him back and ask where your deposit is.  Tell him Mr. Whiskers died and you now want the extra 1K you took off so you can pay for the funeral arrangements.  Those mini caskets are unbelievably priced  Joey
511413,tb4me,2010-10-13 00:18:00,3295,Dude that is Great!
511445,Daplumma,2010-10-13 02:15:00,1961,SWEEEEET!
511552,fisherman7,2010-10-13 16:36:00,325," Yes Solopaddler, that really was my response. And it was a real email exchange. Let the hero worship begin"
511556,Headhunter,2010-10-13 16:51:00,5703,Tell him you have decided to change your mind about selling the boat since Mr. Whiskers has met his demise... and you will be burying him in the boat as you are no longer in a position to take the financial hit of a proper burial service. HH PS... swedish meat balls are brutal!
511557,Stoty,2010-10-13 16:55:00,2910,LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL  I can't believe how many of those scams are going. I got at least 4 when trying to sell my boat. Unreal!
