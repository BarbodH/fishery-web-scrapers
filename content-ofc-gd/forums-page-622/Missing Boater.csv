Two Toronto men, aged 73 and 48, were rescued from the water and taken to hospital with hypothermia after their 14-foot fishing boat capsized, sending the boaters into the water.

The York Regional Police Marine Unit, with the assistance of Georgina Fire and Emergency Services and a search and rescue Hercules aircraft from Canadian Forces Base Trenton, launched a search for the third missing boater yesterday, a 20-year-old Georgina man, but were unsuccessful.  Today, the York Regional Police Marine Unit continues the search. The public, especially boaters and operators of personal watercraft, are asked to avoid the area of Cook's Bay, near Ravenshoe Road, while police officers and the Underwater Recovery Unit attempt to locate the missing boater.
