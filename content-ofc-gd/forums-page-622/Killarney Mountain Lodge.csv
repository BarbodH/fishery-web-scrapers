511512,TC1OZ,2010-10-13 13:37:00,987,Anyone stayed here before and know how the fishing is in the area?  I'll be there Friday-Sunday if anyone wants to hook me up with some info it would be much appreciated.  Any tips are welcomed!  Thank you in advance.

The lake in that area have been hit hard by acid rain... fishing opportunities are very limited... but the scenery up there is 2nd to none, so bring the camera, the hiking boots and have fun! If you have access to a boat, Baie Fine is the world's only freshwater fjord and a simply beautiful place to see. HH"

The report on here from this past summer had lots and lots of smallies in it...
