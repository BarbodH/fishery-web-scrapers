511224,aniceguy,2010-10-12 12:11:00,1094,thanks Wayne those were enjoyable
511230,Carp,2010-10-12 13:00:00,1488,Some great viewing Wayne. Thanks for taking the time to upload the videos.
511274,tb4me,2010-10-12 16:17:00,3295,Cool stuff there wayne! I always wanted to get into flying. You just made me want to even more
511346,kickingfrog,2010-10-12 20:27:00,8333,"  If that's the criteria, are there any walleye anywhere?"
511372,Terry,2010-10-12 21:36:00,14456,I was fishing the kawarthas on sunday I was by myself so pictures are bad  but they are walleye LOL           so just maybe it's thaqt one evil lake that has no walleye
511419,Fisherman,2010-10-13 00:44:00,7201,"I'm putting a seatbelt on my computer chair..now I know why someone else said they were ""leaning"" on those turns, I almost fell out, super nice videos."
511528,ehg,2010-10-13 14:22:00,2666,Thanks for taking us along for that perspective of the landscape. Amazing videos!
511695,fishnsled,2010-10-14 02:30:00,3520,That camera looks good in HD Wayne. Very cool footage. I've noticed that camera is getting a lot of use with the pros. Saw it being used on the Mercer Report this week as well as the Chilean miner rescue.
510789,glen,2010-10-10 13:50:00,2641,The ground looks like a golf course with all the green trees and blue water.
510810,Slop,2010-10-10 15:09:00,151,Cool vids! Is that Wilson Lake that you flew over before landing?
510837,TennesseeGuy,2010-10-10 17:14:00,957,"Wayne, thanks for taking us on some nice rides.  I especially appreciate your post since I'm sitting out October this year.  Hope you don't have to buy too many cases of beer.  That's an awfully pretty airplane.  Don't want it to have scars."
510873,irishfield,2010-10-10 19:58:00,26272," If you are refering to the 2nd video.. approaching Temagami from the South.. it starts at Herridge Lake, and you can see the angled laneway down into Papa Johns Lodge at the 40 second mark.  Video 5 is now up, departing Temagami to the East and I will soon have up #6 that shows the beautiful sandbar of Obabika Lake before I circle and land on Clearwater Lake."
510899,tomO,2010-10-10 22:49:00,363,Nice vids Wayne. I've never seen a prop like that before on a plane.
510900,irishfield,2010-10-10 22:55:00,26272,"It's just a two blade prop riverrat... it's just the way digital video inputs a line at a time, side to side, that it picks it up as curved. Wish there was a way around it.. I've tried all the settings. Next try is a new software upload for the camera that loads at 50 frames per second instead of 60. Might make a difference.. I'll find out next year as I'm grounded for now. Have a bad cylinder on my engine.  Mods please tell me why Riverrat without a space is filtered to come up as Dumb Ass !!!"
510902,Terry,2010-10-10 23:00:00,14456,? keeps coming up mud butt when I try
510903,Roy,2010-10-10 23:01:00,13728," I have no idea, Wayne. I just fixed it until someone tells me otherwise."
510904,irishfield,2010-10-10 23:02:00,26272,"Yes, contestant # 2 has a question! lol"
510908,tomO,2010-10-10 23:09:00,363,Dumb Ass! thats what my wife calls me.
510920,kickingfrog,2010-10-10 23:38:00,8333, I must be related to you.
510922,irishfield,2010-10-10 23:47:00,26272,At least we know whom bribed the mods now to add your name to the filter!!!  Video #6 is up ! Some beautiful scenery in this one.
510925,tomO,2010-10-10 23:56:00,363,I didn't even I was being filtered. I'm goin to shower now.
510971,irishfield,2010-10-11 03:01:00,26272,Video #7 is added... last two I'll get up and posted tomorrow.
510985,Moosebunk,2010-10-11 05:42:00,3970,"Enjoyed these Wayne.  Had to wait to get to work to open them, but it's been a couple good nightshifts sharing the skies with ya.  Thanks bud.  Looking forward to more summer stuff from ya."
510993,Handlebarz,2010-10-11 10:13:00,3790,great videos wayne thanks for sharing them that sure does look like a lot of fun and would be nice to have one of my own to do some of that lake to lake fishing with less portage.
511024,Whopper,2010-10-11 14:15:00,2174,Thanks Wayne Now I'm really missing my annual float plane ride
511028,Fish Farmer,2010-10-11 14:33:00,2234,"Thanks for sharing Wayne. 1 more video and I'll have it down pat, flying lessons. Now to figure out how to get wings on my boat. Man, Lac Seul or Nipigon would be my next landing Gezz it can stand up, I got fly legs"
511069,irishfield,2010-10-11 18:04:00,26272,Eight is up.. final one to come in a bit.
511070,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-11 18:12:00,0,  I love the landing vids....ALMOST makes me wanna fly again......almost...  Seeing where yer landing now. I fished just south??? of your cottage a couple years back with Hyatt and a few other friends. I forget the name of the guy who had us to his place though. Caught a few lakers and a couple pickerel. It was just off the main ice road on the right side. I'd say only a mile from your place.
511072,Terry,2010-10-11 18:42:00,14456, sorry there are no walleye in Temagami  LOL  at lest not with my name on them
511073,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-11 18:44:00,0,  We didnt catch any walleye. Only yellow pickerel. lol
511076,Terry,2010-10-11 18:55:00,14456,"I can't catch yellow, blue or green pickerel either on Temagami"
511077,irishfield,2010-10-11 19:00:00,26272,Final Video is up... heading for home to face reality!!
511103,bigfish1965,2010-10-11 22:32:00,3382, Thats the rolling shutter effect that CMOS sensors have when shooting video. They take each image int he video from left to right. CCD sensors do not have that problem but they are bad at low light.

510573,Spiel,2010-10-09 10:19:00,9065,"That's pretty cool Wayne. Funny, like other clips I've watched from the plane I found myself leaning left and right as the plane banked....LOL  Question, is the video cam mounted outside of the plane?  I also noticed right at the end of the clip that the plane appeared to bounce a bit, turbulence?"
510574,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-09 10:56:00,0,Nice view of the creek. Looks very smooth up there for summer flying.
510575,Terry,2010-10-09 11:19:00,14456,very cool
510589,kickingfrog,2010-10-09 12:46:00,8333, Weren't you payin' attention? He's got Lloyd mounted on the outside of the plane.  Lloyd sure does have a steady hand though.   Thanks for taking the time Wayne.
510611,Terry,2010-10-09 15:44:00,14456,so is that the gopro camera or whatever it's called  and somehow I thought it didn't have sound when we were on the U & Me trip......?
510612,irishfield,2010-10-09 15:59:00,26272," Yes Chris, I have it mounted out on the wings strut... as for the ""turbulence"".. it takes some work to stick your arm out 3 feet at 80 MPH and push a shutter button!! lol     Yes Terry, the Gopro Hero HD. On the boat trip I had the waterproof cover on and sound is definitely there you just have to turn it way up. Same cover on for flying... it's just a tad louder than people talking on a boat!"
510615,Spiel,2010-10-09 16:52:00,9065," Well that would explain the ""turbulence"".  Thank you.   "
510629,Jds63,2010-10-09 18:48:00,1365,"love the video , that camera gives you the birds eye view for sure , the 1080 looks awesome on the Mac LED screen"
510649,misfish,2010-10-09 20:27:00,29133,Sure beats fighting through traffic.  Great vid Wayne.  How far a walk to the swamp?
510659,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-09 21:32:00,0,Some Area forecast.  .30 to 50 is plain nuts for the start of a trip.  Nice final.
510661,Bernie,2010-10-09 21:40:00,3190,"Hiya Wayne, good to see you on again. I will have to wait to get home before I load those videos. Looking forward to seeing them."
510665,irishfield,2010-10-09 21:50:00,26272," Forecast was 10K wind from the SW. There was no wind at all when I left home Andy. Great thing about float flying, there is usually somewhere to get the nose into the wind. Funny part was docking... I shut the engine down and drifted back to my neighbours dock. Fired back up and drove up to mine.. got out the passenger door and tied the airplane to the dock and then got back in and shut the engine down!"
510668,walleyejack,2010-10-09 22:11:00,358,Nice videos !! thanks for sharing.
510669,Joey,2010-10-09 22:13:00,9122,Very cool Wayne.  Seeing that I might not be so scared next time if we were to go up in it.  Too bad the winds kept us grounded last time.  Joey
510697,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-10 00:15:00,0,  I wasn't saying anything against your flight. Not your fault the forecasters got it wrong. You could really see your drift and the cloud shadows racing over the ground.  Looking backwards gives me motion sickness....
510698,irishfield,2010-10-10 00:17:00,26272,Third video is up... do you know why I own someone a case of beer Andy?
510700,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-10 00:29:00,0,  With two more hours and the fact you already did 6 hours of rowing....running out of light by chance?....
510703,irishfield,2010-10-10 00:34:00,26272,Na.. I wasn't sure my heart was gonna last the final 2 hours.. but I guess I passed my stress test. Case of beer... I didn't retract the water rudders until half way thru the take off..
510745,irishfield,2010-10-10 02:56:00,26272,Video 4 added. 5 more to come later.  And Andy I love the rearward shots... it's a view I never get to see!
510753,kickingfrog,2010-10-10 03:13:00,8333, Lets hope not!  Did I mention that if I sit backward on the subway and try to read I get a little motion sick?
510756,irishfield,2010-10-10 03:31:00,26272,"The next 4 are shot viewing forward Rob, with less propellor ""chatter""... so you can straighten yourself out tomorrow! lol"
510757,Leecher,2010-10-10 03:34:00,7832,Thanks for the tour Wayne That was absolutely awesome Looking forward to the others Again thanks for taking the time and sharing Leechman
510758,kickingfrog,2010-10-10 03:35:00,8333,"  No worries, this is better than watchin' monkeys smell their fingers."
510771,Terry,2010-10-10 10:41:00,14456,I love the videos  but on my computer or with my eyes I ready don't see much difference between the different resolutions
