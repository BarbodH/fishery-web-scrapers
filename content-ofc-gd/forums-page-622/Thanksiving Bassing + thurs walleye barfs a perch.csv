511153,Kwan,2010-10-12 01:35:00,132,"Hey!  So I finally got a picture from Thursday's night fishing and FINALLY got my one and likely only eye for the year.  I was so happy as my rod bent over 'cause I thought I had tangled with someone's lure or something.  It barfed out a perch Here it is swimming in our sink!    and its barf   nasty little bugger perch    you can figure out the spot if you've been there.  It's not that great though, 1 in 10 outtings for this   I gutted the eye, chopped up the bones for above and the meat is in below     We had some family over on Saturday night, so I tried to nap some before sleeping 'till 4 am, and time to go! Rice Lake in search of largemouth pb breaking bass.  well, we couldn't break the weight but had a blast with the active ones we did find   not a largie but I'll take it haha   same fish    theres a largie!   heres my friend with another bass off his senko thats been working well.  gotta have o-rings though, or else   I had my slack line run sideways in the morning, but I lost the fish after having it on for 5 seconds.  We went't back to that fallen tree n the evening and my friend picked this one up on his senko  we both got a giant perch each lol    and its good to finally get my old man on some bass each outing..  best year for all of us for sure      sunset cove resort is where we went out from.  definately great people great place!   we'll definately release more of these in the future.  we are releasing too few     and this is what we caught in Hong Kong LOL        hahahahaha  hope you enjoyed"

511194,Joey,2010-10-12 03:37:00,9122,Super report Kwan.  That fish looks really tasty!!!  Love the Sunset Cove picture.  Joey
511197,Kwan,2010-10-12 03:59:00,132, Small and slow haha.
511199,tb4me,2010-10-12 04:11:00,3295,Cool pics! Never seen anyone cook the bones and head before..Interesting.Thanks for sharing.
511247,Rod Caster,2010-10-12 13:58:00,5784,My old roomy from Ghana used to cook pike in it's entirety. He'd steak the fish from head to tail and bake the whole thing. He would laugh at me for wasting meat when I showed him how to fillet. We are spoiled when we get boneless fillets that's for sure.  Nice pics Kwan. Rice is an awesome lake isn't it?
511283,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-12 17:03:00,0,Excellent report Kwan. Just be carefull when your chewing on that fish head.lol Are you jigging for the squid in that last pic? If so that's really neat!  Oh and congrats on your first pickerel.
511287,perchslayer666,2010-10-12 17:12:00,280,"Wow, nice stir fry Walleye - I have to try that out this year!!! Lots of people don't do this but, if you boil up the bones and head you get a real nice fish broth that can be used for soups and chowders, why let it go to waste? Were those samllies wormy?"
