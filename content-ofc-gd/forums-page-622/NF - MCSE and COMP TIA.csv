I would be looking for full time courses or condensed courses that cover all bases from basic to advanced. I've done some research but just don't know which are the better programs/schools out there. Also, any good books that you can think of would be most helpful as well.Thanks for any help.  James"

But most wouldn't hire someone with only these as their computer training background.  I know there are several community colleges that will take you from basic knowledge to being ready to pass certs to become a MCP (microsoft certified professional).  If you really know what your doing with computers, and can prove yourself you could get a decent job with only compTIA or a few random Microsoft certs, but if you are worried about taking a quick refresher course then taking the exam... its not for you."

Back in 1999 when I went the cost was $20,000 for the year. It paid off big time though as I'm now an IT Manager with the government of the North West Territories."
