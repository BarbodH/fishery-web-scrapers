The bite was very very slow compared to ussual we fished and fished tried everything and was only able to land 5 decent ones in the boat but i'll tell you one thing what a nice day it was , no wind , sunny and no clouds at all... We enjoyed our day very much even if we only got 5 fish into the boat plus we saw a cow moose  !! Here's a picture of what we caught...    Get out there and have some fun don't forget the Yum dingers for some Fall largemouth bass fishing !"

511505,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-13 13:24:00,0,"I'm assuming you caught those in Nipissing? They have been introducing Largies to cater to American clients, and it looks like the population is doing well! I have to drive up there one of these days! Thanks for sharing."
511519,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-13 13:47:00,70,Nope they're not from Nipissing! It's a small Largemouth Bass/Pike lake about 30 min from home
