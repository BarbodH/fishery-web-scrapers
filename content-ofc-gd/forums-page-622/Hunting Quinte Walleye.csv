After a good Thankgiving turkey dinner at a local restaurant, and, getting to watch the Leafs kick the Senators butts we hit the sack.  Six fifteen saw us on the boat and heading out for the usual great time on the water with Fishunter. I've got quite a few pics, and, don't want to make this a long wordy post.  Somebody once said ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" so (with a few captions) here goes...  Beautiful Picton Harbour, view from our hotel room    Waiting for Walter    Picton Bay sunrise    Smoke On the Water    Rod and planer board    Waiting/talking fishing    Juli playing her mini-walleye, lol    Never took a pic of that fish, but, Lloyd should have had a catcher's mitt on the way Juli launched it at his head!!!!!  Craig's mini-gold    The BATTLE BEGINS!!    Eight minutes later, checking the scale    17.4 lbs of BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!  My freshwater drum PB    CAPTAIN FRANK (had to be in Lloyd ""caps"" if I'm the captain, LOL!!!)    Juli's smaller sheepie    [Craig battling his behemoth sheepshead    13 lbs of drum...another PB    Come Sail Away    Happy Campers    Juli taking photos, in her glory    Lloyd and I (post fishing)     We ended up catching and releasing the two small walleyes, and, nailing a bunch of sheepies (Juli also got one around 10 lbs that I don't have the pic of yet). Lloyd, man, it is always a pleasure spending time on the water with you!  We all had a great time, and, I know Craig really enjoyed learning some new techniques and talking Temagami with you.  Looking forward to hitting the ice with you this year for some fun times.   Juli and I also took my boat out on Long Point yesterday.  Took home 20 keeper perch, released a bunch of small ones.  My 12"" fatty    Heading home the sky turned black    The heavens opened    A plate of perch     What a great Thanksgiving/fishing weekend!!!  Have another day off tomorrow...fishing again...LIFE IS GOOD!!!!!!!"
511420,Terry,2010-10-13 00:46:00,14456,good report and sounds like a good time on the water  too bad the walleye were not biting
511422,mercman,2010-10-13 00:50:00,7054,excellent sheeps !! they really put up a fight.More than any bass.Got a few this summer here in the St Lawerence near montreal.Mine were in the 12lb range.Nver knew much about them before and sure didnt know they came in the 17lb range Thanks for sharing.  Paul
511435,bucktail,2010-10-13 01:43:00,1857,Man those grunts fight!!	I love them!!  I was hoping those perch were from the bay tho
511437,irishfield,2010-10-13 01:46:00,26272,Same results when Lloyd takes me out fishing Frank!! I finally had to start taking him out to get fish in the boat!
511438,fishhunter,2010-10-13 01:51:00,604,LOL
511444,Joey,2010-10-13 02:12:00,9122,"Really great report.  I've yet to catch a sheepy so don't know what the fight is all about, but sounds like they are a strong beast.  Looks like you all had a great time and those scenery shots are really good Joey"
511448,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-13 02:25:00,2690,"Thanks, all!!  Terry, yeah it would have been nice to get some big pickereyes, but, I knew the fishing had been tough there the last few weeks.  The sheepies helped, and, it was great getting Juli's dad out on the water for the third time this year with us. Mercman, Bucktail and Joey...the sheepies really surprised me.  Most of the ones I've caught before have been in the 2-3 lb range, with one around 6 lbs off the rocks in Southampton.  Scrappy, but, when you start hitting them over 10 lbs, wow!  I wasn't disappointed at all when I saw what it was on the end of my line.  Any fish that fights like that gets my respect! Wayne, lol!!  Sounds like you and Lloyd had a bit of paradise fishing up there a few weeks ago.  He keeps telling us to head up Temagami way (Juli's dad, Craig always loved it up there too)...so we are definitely considering it as our end of August holiday next year."
511452,thatleetboy,2010-10-13 02:30:00,143,"Those are great pix, thx for sharing. Looks like an awesome day!"
511454,irishfield,2010-10-13 02:33:00,26272,"Come on up Frank. Camp in the Provincial Park, right across from my dock, and I'll take you out on a Laker Charter."
511455,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-13 02:39:00,2690," Thanks for the offer, Wayne."
511456,GBW,2010-10-13 02:47:00,8460,"Hey Frankie, ""Happy Campers"" was the name of my folks 1st boat, ""Happy Campers II"" was the second. Still a good day fishing is better then any day working.  I CANNOT WAIT till the BOQ G2G."
511457,GBW,2010-10-13 02:48:00,8460,Is this an open offer?  LOL.  You can make your call after the BOQ G2G...
511475,solopaddler,2010-10-13 08:54:00,8605,"A bit early yet for the big eyes, nonetheless looks like a fantastic time!"
511479,spincast,2010-10-13 09:28:00,3279,"Great way to spend Thanksgiving with the family Frank!.  Way to go on the flock tending there, too bad there wasn't a county fair on - might have been able to enter yours into the Big sheep of the year contest LOL.   Great report and great shots. That Rosebud boat in the first pic looks like a nice restore job. Like I said after our trip up to Temagami, its a must do.  Bet Craig is looking at his boat all over again now ? Time to get her out next year?"
511509,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-13 13:34:00,0,"Sounds like you had a great thanksgiving weekend! When some people say sheephead dont fight, they dont know what they are talking about.lol As a sport fishermen, I would not complain about catching sheephead all day! But if I was out for a meal and kept catching them, THEN it may get annoying.lol  Never fished Quinte in the fall but may give it a go this year(for the huge sheephead). Love the smoke on the water, fire in the sky shot! Thanks for sharing"
511514,Fish Farmer,2010-10-13 13:40:00,2234,"BOQ BEST, nothing better than a good Sheephead report  . I hope the Sheephead are on when I get down. Catch and release fishery, and Better fight than a Walleye Boot. Thanks for posting. My first trip this year is in a couple weeks. First time I've seen so many boats in the Harbor."
511587,fishnsled,2010-10-13 19:20:00,3520,Nice report Frankie!
