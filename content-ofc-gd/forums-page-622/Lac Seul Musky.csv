511610,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-13 20:42:00,0,WOW! That second one is a fish of a lifetime!! Beautiful speciman! Thanks for sharing!
510625,FisherMike,2010-10-09 18:06:00,108,"Hey everyone!!!  i havent posted in a while.  i just finished up another season on lac seul a few weeks ago.  this year was our second annual fall musky trip which we do once our camp is closed for the season.  BenBeattie, myself and a couple other guides from my lodge are trying to make this a yearly trip. big thanks to ben and his wife kelly for having us at their house.  i fished 11 days last year for zero musky although everyone else on the trip managed one or two.  this was my year.  i finally caught my first two muskies and they were beauties.         hopefully the pics work.  the smaller fish, my first musky ever, is a 46 incher, and the big one is a 51 incher.  it took me 18 long days of fishing to land my first musky, and it was well worth the wait.  i caught the 51 the next day.  thanks to my good buddy BenBeattie for seeing my frustration and not letting me leave till i caught a musky, or two.  cant wait till next fall."
510626,FisherMike,2010-10-09 18:14:00,108,i forgot to mention that we also boated a 49.5 incher as well.
