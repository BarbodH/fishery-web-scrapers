But she was too sick to go she said and it was past 12 o'clock already !! I decided to txt one of my buddies to see if he wanted to go fishing for a couple of hours in the afternoon, but sometimes on thanksgiving weekend it's hard to get somebody , people all have suppers to go too and family to visit... But he txted me back and said sure I'll go, by the time we started fishing it was past 2 pm. Talk about a good couple of hours of fishing right downtown Sturgeon Falls!! Caught 13 really nice eyes!! I caught 11 of them my buddy got frustrated till the last 30 min he caught 2 of them lol We had a great time! Don't ever look pass any downtown/city waters they can be very successfull at times!!!   Here's a few pictures of what we caught !!    22"" fat fall walleye (released)    Walleye in the slot ( released of course to be able to make some more walleye's !! )    2 nice keeper walleyes for a nice meal (notice the 2 different color variations)  Never under estimated Urban area's there can be some awsome fishing at times!!    THANKSGIVING??? HOW ABOUT THANKSFISHING!!!!"

511160,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-12 01:46:00,70,No it wasn't a blue walleye it was like a silver/gold variation we caught two that day of that kind of color...
