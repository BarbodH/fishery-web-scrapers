Guess what these pins are rusting and so are the washers and this hardware which is supposed to to be stainless steel is beginning to stain the vinyl cushions . I had purchased the Tempress seats many years ago for my previous boat and had no issues with them but back then they were made in the good old USA and these to my surprise are now made in China .Same price , inferior quality. I have E- mailed Tempress twice, once to the Tech dept and once to the Sales dept. Three weeks have gone by and still waiting to hear their response. Buyer Beware"
