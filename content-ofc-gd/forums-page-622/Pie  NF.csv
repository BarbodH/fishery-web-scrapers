511030,bigugli,2010-10-11 14:51:00,6138,"The turre, or properly known as the Common Murre, is a coastal bird that lives along the cliffs of the Newf and Lab coasts. A poor flyer but fantastic swimmer, it often got caught in the fishermen's nets. In years of poor catch harvests, fishermen from the outports would go out and hunt them or net them. They'd be cooked in a pie, not unlike..."" 4 and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie' as the rhyme goes.  Years ago a school buddy's Mom made a fantastic pie. His uncle would ship a crate of the birds from St John's every year."

510986,Moosebunk,2010-10-11 05:46:00,3970,"Apple pecan pie.  Instead of the all goo pecan filling about half of that is replaced by applesauce.  Not quite as sweet as regular pecan but 10 times better tasting.  Otherwise, regular cheese cake doused in Frangelico or chopped berries and maple syrup."
511000,fish_fishburn,2010-10-11 11:15:00,1311,I know raisin pie is gross to most people. I think the reason why is because they have only tried store bought pies. They are awful. Now my moms is another story. A slice of her raisin pie and you will swear you died and went to heaven.
