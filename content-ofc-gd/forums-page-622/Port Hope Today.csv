We had a picnic at the bottom of the Ganaraska River, and walked along the shore watching the salmon desperately trying to get upstream, I was surprised at how much time they spend just catching their breath.  Okay, here's my dumb question of the day.... there wasn't a single person fishing there. Why was that? Are these Atlantic Salmon, and it's never allowed? Or some other reason?  We drove back via Lake Shore Road and in Bond Head there were several people beach fishing, as well as at the mouth of the river there.  I'm pretty sure you guys have the obvious answer, which isn't apparent to me.   Cheers"
510936,chessy,2010-10-11 00:20:00,610,the river is closed as of sept 30 . it is only open south of the railroad trax  and these fish are chinook some coho and browns and even some rainbows.. but mostly salmon
510949,thatleetboy,2010-10-11 01:28:00,143,"So, it's OK in Lake Ontario, or at the mouth of the river, but once the fish are in the battle upstream, they're off-limits?  Makes sense. Thanks for answering!"
