Check out the shooter after he shoots...and how much he is shaking...it almost looks like he's ready to cry.  What an amazing video.  Enjoy..  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31mRIIzUtuI"

511810,ctranter,2010-10-14 15:59:00,543,"That is intense!  Wow, I can't believe how the moose was responding to their challenge.  This is definitely one of the most intense moose hunting video's I've ever seen."
511813,stubbex1,2010-10-14 16:06:00,164,"wow great video!  my heart comes out of my chest when i see a coyote or a doe go by my stand.....i'm a little worried whats going to happen when ""that"" buck comes around, never mind a massive bull!!!!"
511819,Fang,2010-10-14 16:57:00,1330,"probably the last time he'll wear those hunting pants.  I had  bull come out of the bush like that about 10 years ago. Big rack and we were paddling a canoe down a beaver pond first morning of the moose hunt. I guess he got all riled up as he heard the sound of our paddles hitting the side of the canoe. I had a bull tag in my pocket and my gun across my lap as he came up to about 10 yards. Problem was it was the first week and the tag I had was a group tag and my buddies weren't coming in till week number 2. I took a bunch of shots (film) and showed the prints the next week. They all said I should have shot it....  That's my Leaf curse, since then I haven't even seen a moose qand worse yet had my vacation for moose hunt pulled this year by work.  If I can't be there nice video to watch"
511823,anders,2010-10-14 17:14:00,1168,the guide is from Wawa...really good guy...has already guided clients to 4 bulls this year...he knows what he is doing.
511825,Terry,2010-10-14 17:22:00,14456,"I thought you couldn't shoot an animal in the water, does that not apply to bow hunting or am I completely wrong....LOL"
511826,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-14 17:25:00,0,  Only ethics Terry.....  Here another couple marty that'll get yer heart racing..lol The first one its no wonder she doesnt have a bloody nose and the second...you can bet he changed his underwear. lol     
511830,Terry,2010-10-14 17:38:00,14456,I have seen both of them before I don't think I could sit there so calmly ....but they are great videos
511856,anders,2010-10-14 19:04:00,1168," I believe when its swimming its illegal, bow or rifle.  while its walking through the water feeding or whatever is legal"
