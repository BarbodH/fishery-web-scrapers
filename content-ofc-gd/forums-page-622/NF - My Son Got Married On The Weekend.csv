My son was in a serious car accident a few weeks ago and needed the jaws of life to get him out.  Months ago I had been working on a little something to say at the reception but had put it away because I felt it sounded too much like I was at his funeral.  When the accident happened I knew that should I ever find myself at his funeral, I would not be able to say a word for the grief would be too heavy.  So, three days before his wedding I wrote him this poem.   BRIAN  All alone and quiet, one August Summer Night I was 7 months pregnant, with no future in sight Not a penny did I have, not a friend in my tracks I turned to God and I surrendered....Brian, I gave you back  October 30th you were born, I thought I was going to die Not just from the pains of birth, but from facing up to a lie I had already given you back; my heart had turned to stone Once again I went to God and I no longer felt alone  Your Heavenly Father and I, well....we go into it I was scared to keep you, but He told me not to quit I had no place to go to; He said trust in My Son And so I had to go on faith, for he chose me, to be your Mom  There have been a lot of people, over the years that have come to us But especially so, those first 5 years, when it was all about trust First to come was My brother Michael, who still brings us so much love Darlene came soon after, whom I believe was sent, from up above  Not long after that, I met your Dad, who gladly adopted you The Moore Family welcomed us, and all things became new You were after me for quite some time, to give you a little brother You named him Tyler, and your love for him, I saw was like no other  You know the rest, which brings us here on your wedding day I still remember that phone call, for this is what you had to say Mom....shes so beautiful, shes so BEAUTIFUL I gotta have her Mom, I so need for her to stay  You truly are beautiful Priscilla; your spirit is oh so kind I couldnt be happier to welcome you, right now, at this time You surely do love Brian; I remember our talk one night Your eyes gave up tears of love; I knew you were just right  I thank God for all that has happened, for keeping you both safe And bringing us all together, so we could all celebrate I wish you both much happiness, much love and tenderness Please know that you have family, one of lifes greatest gifts."
