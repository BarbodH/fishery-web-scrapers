511391,MJL,2010-10-12 23:02:00,2427,"Thanks Shaun for putting the vids up.  Back in the day I used to tape the carp & steelhead episodes of UOA on VHS tape (as well as other shows). I also have an episode of Fish TV with Leo & Steve, fishing for carp, starring you. Yes I was a nerd and watched them when I couldn't get out ...The VCR doesnâ€™t work with my new TV  I must say those carp in the 'twins' episode are very lucky fish"
511511,Rattletrap2,2010-10-13 13:37:00,1652,Thanks Shaun! I just watched the episode of you and Blake on Rice lake. Yours is still one of the best shows out there! Just the right mix of entertainment and education without all the loud noise of some shows. Please keep up the good work!
