511674,jeffw,2010-10-14 01:18:00,267,I was at lebarons in markham and was looking at the new rapala rtype musky rods. Just wondering if anyone has tried them or any of the other rapala musky rods. Cheers Jeff
511678,houski,2010-10-14 01:30:00,61,"Nope, haven't tried them. I did just get a brand new St. Croix Mojo Musky 7'6"" Heavy Fast jerkbait rod though...Pretty sweet!"
511694,Gregoire,2010-10-14 02:29:00,1397,"I have a rapal magnum musky rod. It's a pool cue, but I use it as a backup. I didn't know they made a r-type musky rod. I'm definitely interested. How long is it? Just lookead and all the specs are on the rapala canada website. I like the split grip rod. How much are they selling for?"
511704,jeffw,2010-10-14 03:21:00,267,"The rod I was looking at is the 6'9"" model I belive. XH, 30-80 lbs and lure weight of 3-8oz. Thats the only muskie model that they show in there catalog. I would really like to see the 7'6"" model though. They are selling the rod for just under $90. Cheers Jeff"
511763,goodtimer,2010-10-14 12:53:00,53,"have the 2-piece rapala magnum series 6'9 musky rod.  bought it to replace an anoying 1-piece (too long for transport)...  good rod for good price, $49.99 at BPS.  no complaints yet, seems built to last but we'll see"
511768,jbailey,2010-10-14 13:11:00,866," bought the same one, no complaints at all."
511791,adempsey,2010-10-14 14:57:00,1498,"I have one of the heavier Rapala R2 rods (2 piece). I have not landed anything very large on it at all.  I use it more for pike fishing and have not tossed any really large baits with it.    I think it's a good value rod, but I would most likely go with the St.Croix if it was going to be one of my main fishing rods.    I really want to go see some of those new lines of rods St.Croix put out.  In addition to the new Mojo Musky, they also have a new reasonably well priced series of walleye rods."
511875,jeffw,2010-10-14 20:59:00,267,"I was also looking at the 6'9"" magnum rod but its alittle light for the baits that I typically throw. I had a older team daiwa muskie rod. I believe it was rated for 1-5oz lures and suited me perfectly but unfortunately broke.I've used several st.croixs and gloomis rods but find they are not worth the price tag. I haven't seen the mojo muskie rod yet though."
511881,Gregoire,2010-10-14 21:10:00,1397, I have the magnum 2 pc rod and I think it's rated up to 5 oz. I'll check when I get home.
511958,Gregoire,2010-10-15 00:26:00,1397,"Just to confirm the 2 piece magnum is 6'9"" and rated for lures from 1-5oz"
