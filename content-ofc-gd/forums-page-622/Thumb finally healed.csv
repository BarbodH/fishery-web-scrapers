I fished for pickerel at night from shore right up to closer but thats about it. If anyone has room in their boat and needs a good net man. Send me a message. I'm available all days except Sunday(poker day).  If not, I'll go check out a few shore spots and report back, since the girls dont want to rent a boat out in the cold."

511539,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-13 15:09:00,0, Man that would really make my day but there is a reason I dont go out after Thanksgiving. I hate the cold! And I assume its even colder up there!
