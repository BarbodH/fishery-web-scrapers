508633,Moosebunk,2010-10-02 02:07:00,3970,For a post of little words it sure said a tonne.  Great few weeks Dave.  Excellent fish.
508729,DRIFTER_016,2010-10-02 22:28:00,10439,"  Sorry bud, got kind of tied up. Billy's not on the water today so maybe I'll get him later this afternoon. If not tomorrow or early next week before I leave for home."
508747,BillsTheBassMan,2010-10-02 23:17:00,932,I'm even more jealous now that I read that's a dolly and not a char (though I'd take either) - BEAUTIFUL fish.
508753,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-10-02 23:40:00,0,Definitely looks like an awesome fishing trip. In times like these I wish I live further up in the North...

511188,DRIFTER_016,2010-10-12 03:02:00,10439,  Gotta change it up Roy.  How about a nice Zamfir medley?  Just got back about 3 hours ago though so you'll have to wait a bit.
511210,solopaddler,2010-10-12 09:34:00,8605," Even better a Zamfir/Kenny G combo. But that would be Gay road gay.  Hope you're feeling better, call me when you get a chance."
511221,aniceguy,2010-10-12 12:01:00,1094,dang all I can realyl say danng!!!!
511259,S.M.05,2010-10-12 15:06:00,145,"Awesome fish drifter, especialy that dolly. Have to make it down to your part of gods country some time in my life."
511317,cityfisher,2010-10-12 19:07:00,959,very nice!! Im soooo jealous
508288,DRIFTER_016,2010-09-30 20:07:00,10439,I have been living the trout bum life in Alaska since Labour day and this has been the nicest September in many years. We have had over 3 weeks of sunny and warm days in a row. All that has come to an end and there is now some rain and termination dust on the mountain tops (won't be long until we have snow on the ground). I will be heading home at the end of next week but here is a little teaser of some of the feesh we have put on the bank so far.                
508289,mercman,2010-09-30 20:09:00,7054,"Man they are some beautiful fish !!! congrats.What a life, eh?"
508290,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-30 20:10:00,932,"I don't know whether to applaud you or cry of envy - that is some way to roll!  Beautiful pictures, beautiful fish, and a sweet report (even for a teaser).  Alaska is first on my checklist for fishing destination trips.  Have you considered taking a day to go out for some monster Halibut while you're there?"
508292,Rod Caster,2010-09-30 20:17:00,5784,That one fish looks like a Char... Awesome pics!
508293,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-09-30 20:24:00,0,why you gotta go and do that to us? looking forward to more!
508295,Kinger,2010-09-30 20:49:00,351,Wow! I am loving those pics!
508299,muskeybugged,2010-09-30 20:57:00,282,Wow!  Impressive.... Beauty fish you got there!!  Dumb musky guy wants to know what species those are? (the first ones... with the freckles)
508323,Musky or Specks,2010-09-30 22:15:00,2710,Is that an Artic char or a Dolly in full spawning colours.
508324,ctranter,2010-09-30 22:21:00,543,"Gorgeous fish, thanks for the teaser"
508326,spincast,2010-09-30 22:27:00,3279,drewl. awesome fish and scenery.  1 more bucket list item. Fantastic colours on those fish!
508329,fish_fishburn,2010-09-30 22:40:00,1311,Oh my.....those are some beautiful fish. Where bouts in Alaska are you?
508334,danbouck,2010-09-30 23:01:00,4380,oh man. We are going to have an Alaska documentary with your report and Brandon's
508338,misfish,2010-09-30 23:04:00,29133,Made the 6th pic as my back ground. Great pics Dave.
508341,DRIFTER_016,2010-09-30 23:11:00,10439,There will be a full report sometime after Thanks Giving when I get home and have a chance to go through all my shots.   They be Rainbow Trout   It's a Dolly.   Cooper Landing on the Kenai Peninsula.
508342,drwxr,2010-09-30 23:12:00,453,"beautiful report, thanks for not blurring out the background, the scenery looks amazing.."
508343,DRIFTER_016,2010-09-30 23:14:00,10439,  Wrong time of year for the big boy's. They start migrating to deep water in late August. Weather conditions are usually pretty sketchy this time of year also. There are still plenty of 10# to 40# fish around though.
508354,FlyGuy5,2010-09-30 23:35:00,101,great report!!! Are thoes tube flies you are using???  
508356,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-30 23:37:00,0,"WOW!Awesome fishery, and it doesn't look that cold!"
508368,Dutchy,2010-10-01 00:08:00,416,Those are some real nice fish. Nice job!!
508385,dave524,2010-10-01 00:57:00,4508,"Beauty , really like the big chrome HO's, way better fish than the old black chinny boots IMHO"
508431,scuro2,2010-10-01 02:12:00,904,Nice beautiful fish...thanks.
508449,Leecher,2010-10-01 02:59:00,7832,tsk tsk tsk  you can't do that to us Dave  Looking forward to your full report Thanks Dave for the teaser Leechman
508450,Pigeontroller,2010-10-01 03:03:00,2793,Awesome pics!
508451,solopaddler,2010-10-01 03:04:00,8605,"Dude that's awesome. I cannot believe you're able to wade for the ho's this year, that must be amazing!  I was waiting for your phone call the other night. Is Billy joining us next spring or what?  Let me know , gotta get this sorted out soon."
508503,troutologist,2010-10-01 13:58:00,951,That is incredible! Right on....can I come??
