510956,Dozer,2010-10-11 01:59:00,896,Report them stolen.
510972,16sailor,2010-10-11 03:10:00,38,Yep doing that tomorrow
510977,Joey,2010-10-11 03:44:00,9122,"Make sure you get a police report ""paper copy"" just in case the thieves drive on the 407.  If you don't, you'll be responsible for the bill.  My son learned that the $800.00 hard way  Joey"
510987,Hawg Hunter,2010-10-11 08:17:00,204," i too learned the hard way,i had a plated trailer 0ver 20 years ago now, and left it at a place i used ta work(just plain forgot it)i had it there getting some welding done,i think they junked it,then 2 years ago i get a bill from the 407 lol not ever being on it i called the police to see if it was real or not lol he ran the plate and said it was almost a 20 year old plate and yes it was mine,i called and reported it to the 407 folks and they threw the bill out.  if i remember right you have ta go to the lic place first and report it then the police  Hawg Hunter"
511004,Fisherman,2010-10-11 11:44:00,7201,"I'm sure you have the last part backwards, you have to get the pink sheet for loss/theft report from your local PD with a report or incident number, then go to MTO, I've filled out a number of them over the year."
511023,fishing n autograph,2010-10-11 14:14:00,2540," Yup, all you have to do is walk in, have a report made, get the mto form filled out and signed and bring it to the mto. Happens to plenty of people."
511033,Stoty,2010-10-11 14:55:00,2910,"Man...that's brutal!  I HATE PUNKS!   Someone can't use a trailer plate on their car on the 407, can they??"
511048,Joey,2010-10-11 16:06:00,9122," Well you are very lucky, they would not throw my son's out and interest just kept accumulating the more we fought it.  I finally had to pay it and my son paid me back in installments."
511051,Joey,2010-10-11 16:08:00,9122," They can certainly use it on another trailer (which is obviously their intention), and the camera on the 407 takes a pic of it and bills you.  Sometimes the trailer obscures the view of the car plate so only the trailer plate gets photographed and billed."
511290,stubbex1,2010-10-12 17:24:00,164," wait, you are getting a bill from the 407 for the trailer?  4+ years, and i haven't seen a bill!"
511297,Joey,2010-10-12 17:48:00,9122," Yes, I get a bill, but I have a transponder so I have to call each time and tell them the truck plate so they can cancel it."
511330,Bigfisherman,2010-10-12 19:33:00,100," Exact thing just happened to me, but fortunately I had another plate(from my old trailer) so I went to the MTO paid the $10 and transferred it over at least I can go fishing this wknd, will do the police report when I have time."
