Caught on a #4 Silver Blue Fox What a catch! Bass fishing wasn't at it's best, but I'm goin to use an excuse, this Pike scared them away Erie, still amazes me with it's Great fishing. "
511501,TC1OZ,2010-10-13 13:13:00,987,Nice pike! Everyone loves that point! Sometimes its on fire...
511503,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-13 13:14:00,0,Great report. Did you take the 407?lol Thats a nice pike. Did you weigh it?
511523,Fish Farmer,2010-10-13 14:07:00,2234," That's one thing Johnny, I don't need to take the 407 there  plus free launch. Makes for a reasonable day other than the Gas. 40 Min's and I'm on the water. Up at 4:30 and on the water by 5:30 then off at dark. Then stop for Wings and refreshments. You would be surprised how big that fish got at the end of the night  . I think his smile weighted more. No I didn't weight it, had a skinny body and big head, rough guess I'd say 15. She went back in the water to swim for someone else to catch. I launch at Stromness side of Maitland."

511767,Fish Farmer,2010-10-14 13:06:00,2234,"Yes that #4 Silver Blue Fox works good, it's a little heavier for getting a little deeper. Years ago when I had a trailer on Erie, all I used casting for Bass was a #2or#3 silver Mepps or Black Fury. My Buddy's ran out and bought more"
