511244,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-12 13:44:00,2690,"I'll have a report up when I get time.  Walleye fishing is tough right now...Juli and her dad each got a small one.  I nailed my PB sheepie, 17.4 lbs (what a fight!!) took eight minutes to land that pig.  Say what you want about them, they have power when they get bigger! We had a great time out on the water as usual!! Looking at setting up an ice fishing trip with Lloyd and some of the other guys, on a lake Lloyd knows. Hopefully Hosey (LOL!!!!!!) and Nestor got some gold!!"
511245,Roy,2010-10-12 13:47:00,13728,Thanks Frankie.
511249,I'mHooked,2010-10-12 14:25:00,525,"Well hopefully things won't be as tough and I'll have a little more to report next week, as I'm going to be out with Lloyd this Sunday!  Looking forward to it."
511251,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-12 14:28:00,2690," Have fun, always a great time with Lloyd!  Those pesky golden buggers should be turning on soon."
511303,Terry,2010-10-12 18:19:00,14456,come on guys we live vicariously through Lloyd..we need details  LOL  
511308,Roy,2010-10-12 18:35:00,13728,"OK, let's start with an easier question. What was the feature film on the theatre deck?"
511320,nancur373,2010-10-12 19:15:00,1211,Have to ask Hosey that one. He had a nap and a movie on either end of my nap.  One eater in the boat and lost a couple. I lost a big one trying to get her in too quickly.  We're thinking of changing it to Lloyd's Sheephead Charters. We cought a bunch of them. But fun fighting as always.  And the perch off the dock at the end of the day is always a bonus.
511329,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-12 19:31:00,2690, Patience grasshopper...all will be revealed when you can take the pebble from our hands.
511382,Terry,2010-10-12 22:20:00,14456,"Master Po , I ain't touching your pebbles         LOL"
511384,fishhunter,2010-10-12 22:41:00,604,"IT WAS THE HARDEST 3 DAYS OF FISHING ON THE BAY I HAVE HAD IN YEARS.   LOTS OF FISH IN THE SPOTS BUT LOCK JAW FOR MOST OF THEN. DID GET A FEW GOLD ONES OVER THE WEEKEND AND LOST A COUPLE GOOD ONES. THE BEST PART WAS THE PEOPLE I HAD OUT.   GREAT TIME HAD BY ALL. NOTHING BETTER THEN A DAY ON THE WATER TALKING, LAUGHING AND ENJOYING WHAT NATURE HAS TO OFFER YOU.   ROY THE MOVIE WAS CENTURION. AS NORMAL JOSEY WAS ENJOYING THE IN BOAT MOVIE   LOL"
511389,Terry,2010-10-12 22:53:00,14456,I don't know why but I have a hard time reading typing in caps      that one to the left would fix it  LOL
511392,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-12 23:02:00,2690,  Working on the post right now.
511394,Roy,2010-10-12 23:07:00,13728,Lloyd...he must have slept through most of it.
