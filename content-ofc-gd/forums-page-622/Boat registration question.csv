Service Canada asked me to fill out Declaration where the present owner of a pleasure craft is unable to provide bill and sign it with lawyer. I am wondering if somebody can tell me what is ok to put in the field:""State why the Licence or Bill of Sale cannot be produced"". I don't have any ideas and would appreciate any help. Thanks"
