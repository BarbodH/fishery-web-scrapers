I got a bottle of this stuff from the states and it is suppose to be great but I don't know anyone that has used it or has first hand knowledge ! It is a clothing spray that kills all bitting bugs on contact , sounds good to me ! This blackfly season is going to be a flip of the coin with this strange spring so I want to be perpared Thanks"
