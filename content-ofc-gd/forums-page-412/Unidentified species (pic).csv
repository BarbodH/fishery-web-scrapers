692517,Lip-ripper,2012-05-03 12:51:00,228,"Went out last night chasing channel cats, and ended up catching a couple of these guys in the process. We weren't sure what they were. Do you have any idea? They were about 12-14 inches.      Oh, and we caught some channel cats too. My buddy got his best one so far this year weighing in at 10 lb, 10 oz.  "
692518,Rod Caster,2012-05-03 12:58:00,5784,"I caught a couple of them last year, one at 15 inches. Its a fallfish from what I understand.  Good job o the catfish. I'll be looking for them later this summer."
692519,Harrison,2012-05-03 12:58:00,2202,Horny chub?

692533,Harrison,2012-05-03 13:29:00,2202, I make the play whenever I can...
692534,Spiel,2012-05-03 13:31:00,9065,Could be a Fallfish but a general location where caught would help in determining.
692536,dave524,2012-05-03 13:32:00,4508,I'd be cutting them up for catfish bait
692539,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-03 13:35:00,535,"I've caught those in Paudash and Centre Lake around Bancroft. They seem to fight pretty well for their size, Not sure what they are though."

692552,Fishing yoda,2012-05-03 14:18:00,29,"looks to me its either a really big creek chub or possibly a mix of fallfish and cisco, the dorsal fine kinda makes it look like cisco a bit! but it's probably fallfish from what i can see. here,  Nice catch on the cats!!!"
692555,KShea,2012-05-03 14:24:00,18,"I've caught a couple of what looks like these on the Trent and wad always curious as to what they were, guess now i know lol."
692558,Rod Caster,2012-05-03 14:30:00,5784,Check out this thread Trouty...some good info on the fallfish...what I thought orginially was a horny head chub  http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=58168&hl=lesser known&st=0
692562,Lip-ripper,2012-05-03 14:39:00,228,Thanks guys! Looks to be a fallfish for sure. I've caught them before but never though anything of it.

692722,Christopheraaron,2012-05-03 20:45:00,3525,"For those of you reading the post on lesser known species, it's called a longnose gar, not a gar-pike, just say'n ."
692730,the spirit of fishing,2012-05-03 22:15:00,141,Years ago we caught those when we were fishing for channel cats on the Moira River.They were always a welcome catch because we'd immediately filet them and use the filets for bait.It seemed to be what the bigger channel cats liked the most! Nice catch.
692740,smally21,2012-05-03 22:47:00,993,learned another new thing here today! fallfish who knew.  it kinda looks like an ugliest fish contest around here..
