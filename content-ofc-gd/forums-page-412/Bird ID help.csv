The mottled colouring reminds me of a woodcock, but the size is too large.  One of my books suggests maybe a ptarmigan in summer plumage, but I don't think they are around the Sudbury area.  Any suggestions? "

693195,highdrifter,2012-05-05 03:04:00,2534,"Some kind of owl.  Not a barred or a great grey, but those downy under feathers hint to a silent stalker.."
693199,dave524,2012-05-05 03:09:00,4508,I'd guess a Long Eared Owl by the size and colour.
