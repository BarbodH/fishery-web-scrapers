Had used a ton of different hardbaits, Grass Shrimp, Grubs, Dry and Wet Flies etc. I never got a chance to take a ton of pics as I was to busy catching and landing Trout. In all we hit 17 different rivers in just under 2 weeks. Each one was different with the tidal waters so juggeling them was a ton of fun. Catching Sea Worms and Grass Shrimp 3 times a darn day was a little difficult especially with a nip tide but what is a guy to do.     I have more but have to go through them. This is the spot that we will be building our family home this summer so we can move there permanantly. The trees to the right will be removed soon to allow for a unobstructed view of the Bays. The second one is of our backyard, no worries of nosy neighbours here.      Then these 2 are just for my sure enjoyment. Lol. If you ever get the chance you should take a trip and enjoy what is a absolutely amazing Province. Newfoundland.      Again Im sorry for the last two."
692765,Grimace,2012-05-04 00:01:00,2020,Awesome!!!    Beautiful fish and scenery.   Everytime I go East I always swear that I am going to get my stuff together and move there.
692771,highdrifter,2012-05-04 00:08:00,2534,No apologies needed..  Just spread it on!!
692777,l2p,2012-05-04 00:16:00,346,Nice! hope to get some fishing done those ways this august when we have a planned trip to my friends cottage down in New Brunswick! thanks for sharing
692784,Joeytier,2012-05-04 00:39:00,3990,Cool!  I have never heard of a sea trout.  are they genetically similar to an atlantic?  they sure are similar in appearance.
692839,Sinker,2012-05-04 03:20:00,8692,"Well I read the warning, but still had to open it. Where abouts are you building? No snow?? My old man still has about 5ft where he is on the northern pen!!! You must way south?  I'm jealous!!  S."
692843,SirCranksalot,2012-05-04 03:24:00,3291, They are sea-run browns
692844,Sinker,2012-05-04 03:26:00,8692,We call them German browns where I'm from. We also get sea run specks. I'm surprised you don't have pics of one in here!  S.
692846,The Urban Fisherman,2012-05-04 03:26:00,2050,ya... to say I'm jealous would be the understatement of the century! lol  awesome! congrats!
692864,mbac31,2012-05-04 09:28:00,904,"Im way south Sinker.  100 km from St Johns. These are a Sea Running version of a Brown Trout. We have also Sea Running Brookies which I have pics of also. We have the German Browns that stay in fresh water all year and these that stay in the salt water most of their lives. We caught a ton of Brookies, a few Sea Rainbows, Sea Trout, Hookbills and a Ton of Atlantics this trip also. There is still snow in spots where Im from."
692866,Wolf 3,2012-05-04 10:26:00,134,NICE!
692869,solopaddler,2012-05-04 10:49:00,8605,"Marvin I can only wish I could make a move like that. That spot is absolutely stunning, you're a lucky man!  (the fish were pretty nice too.  )"
693466,mbac31,2012-05-06 13:25:00,904,"Mike, I dont usually post pictures anymore. To much grief. The move is due to my Sons breathing problems so its a no brainer for me.     Im working on getting my guides licence and setting up my Construction business as well as  a Fishing and Hunting outfitter store which I will run the guiding through. I will be able to  offer everything that great Province has to offer. Cotyote, Bear, Moose, Rabbits, Grouse, Geese,  Inland Ducks,  Sea Ducks, Murrs,      Caribou, Sea Trout, Real Atlantic Salmon trips, Depending on the season, trips with commercial fisherman for the experience, Camping, Ocean trips and Cod, Halibut etc. I cant wait to get it all done. Gonna take a while though. Float and Fly fish there with me Mike and you will be blown away. Case in point. I hooked an Atlantic last summer and withing 60 seconds the bugger had me into the last 2 ft of my backing on a Large Arbour reel. Then broke off. I didnt even get a chance to get my footing.    That happens often there.  When it gets done your welcome to bring the family. Warning though you may end up moving there."
