692968,linweir,2012-05-04 14:40:00,202,What engine oil for 4 stroke yamaha 200 HP? SAE-10-30W or 10-40W? Plan to change it by next weekend before Simcoe whitefish season opens. 6 liters enough?
692984,BillM,2012-05-04 15:22:00,17367,All the manuals are available via the Yamaha Motors site..  I'd check it out to be certain..  Don't wanna guess
692987,bigbuck,2012-05-04 15:26:00,2449,Check your manual or contact Yamaha. You don't want to blow that engine because of improper oil for lubrication.

693024,linweir,2012-05-04 17:54:00,202,Contact yamaha dealer about engine oil. It should be full Synthetic SAE 10-30W. I see such platinum 10-30W oil is on sale in one Canadian Tires.
693137,Pigeontroller,2012-05-04 23:59:00,2793,How can you own a 200hp outboard and not know what and how much oil it uses???
693178,Tybo,2012-05-05 01:40:00,1373, The same way that 80% of the population doesn`t know what type of oil there car engine uses. Some one else does it for them.
693182,Pigeontroller,2012-05-05 01:57:00,2793," Mr. Costanza, you need a new Johnson rod!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx2GZ4AJtVM"
693231,bigbuck,2012-05-05 11:58:00,2449,Make sure you get enough. I'd check to see if the API service rating is the same between the original Yamaha oil and the stuff you are buying from CT. If the rating is for example SM on the Yamaha oil and the oil from CT is SM or SN you'll be fine.

693351,Fisherman,2012-05-05 21:32:00,7201," You sure keep your money in a weird place.  As long as the specs a the same or better for the aftermarket oil, be happy, don't worry.  Yamaha, Mercury, BRP, etc,  do not have their own oil wells.  They buy oil in large quantities and add extra additives as required."
693380,captpierre,2012-05-05 23:16:00,2521," The way I figure it, perhaps they have the best additives for my girl.  For the extra $20 to keep my $12K investment running optimally, Id rather pinch pennies elsewhere.  Like $60 for dinner out."
