693174,davey buoy,2012-05-05 01:22:00,5505, Thanks!!!!.
692365,l2p,2012-05-02 23:04:00,346,For those that havent seen it...
692370,davey buoy,2012-05-02 23:16:00,5505," Thanks for the video,all kidding aside,those fish must be immune to almost anything. That river must be the nastiest one I've ever seen. You can see what a huge bussiness that is with little to no regulations."
692373,misfish,2012-05-02 23:29:00,29133, Thats just nasty.
692374,Rod Caster,2012-05-02 23:30:00,5784,"  Ok, THAT'S funny! Hahahaha  I'm happy to say I havnt bought fish in a long time. I keep just enough to eat 2 or 3 meals of fish per week."
692376,Christopheraaron,2012-05-02 23:44:00,3525,"I looove a good piece of halibut, got any tips on your favourite spot in ontario for those!"
692378,bigugli,2012-05-02 23:47:00,6138,"At least catfish is available from U.S. farms. As are tilapia.  Some tilapia also comes from wild harvest in Mexico. Some of the great bass lakes, like El Salto were also stocked with tilapia."
692484,12footspringbok,2012-05-03 11:28:00,459,"I wouldn't touch the stuff with a 10 foot pole...  Unfortunately I don't think there are many fish out there that aren't polluted anymore. Heck, just the other day Tepco admitted they are still dumping 1000 tonnes of highly radioactive water straight into the pacific ocean daily and this has been ongoing for over a year now...  How about some nice Pacific Salmon or Halibut... No thanks...  One thing I would be curious is to see all this fish in the grocery store get tested just like our sport fish do for safe eating reccomendations... Oh wait the results would probably be shocking..."
692489,Billy Bob,2012-05-03 11:37:00,5865," Red meat is bad for you....much worse then any fish you might eat out of Canadian waters....so what's it going to be today....steak, burgers, or how about a nice thick pork chop..."
692530,Beans,2012-05-03 13:23:00,3339,  Shortly after eating some basa fillets I saw this same video on TV...no more basa for me thanks...
692548,Mike Pike,2012-05-03 14:04:00,1332,"That video on Basa is presented by by American catfish farmers( click link below video ).  So it's presented with an adjenda.  I'm not saying the claims in the video aren't all true, but I just know it's was presented by a competing industry."
692602,Billy Bob,2012-05-03 16:18:00,5865,"Look up ""How Fish Sauce is Made""..... disgusting..."
692671,davey buoy,2012-05-03 18:42:00,5505," It's the way they process that also can be a problem. What's that saying,(what you don't know won't hurt ya).If you members didn't give feedback I think I would of run with it..Thanks."
692946,Billy Bob,2012-05-04 13:57:00,5865,I seen it done on the Discovery Channel about a year ago.....  They took ANY kind of fish they could get....if big they would cut it up in smaller pieces.....throw it in a HUGE round concrete vat and cover it for 1 year in the sun....then after one year they would open up a spic-it at the bottom of the vat and let the nasty stuff run through a filter and into a bottle....and there's you fish sauce...
692954,manitoubass2,2012-05-04 14:10:00,11391," and then they call it fermentation... lol  Totally friggin gross.  I had a friend give me some homemade fish sauce once, he said he used anchovies/salt and thats it. It was good in very small amounts, had a nutty flavor to it.  I'll never buy anything off the shelf now however...  "
693010,Spiel,2012-05-04 17:03:00,9065, If you think it gross you may want to stay away from Worcestershire sauce as well.
693013,mercman,2012-05-04 17:11:00,7054,  I DO NOT want to know what i have been sprinkling liberally on my Triple A T-Bones.
693019,manitoubass2,2012-05-04 17:23:00,11391," Controlled fermentation in sanitized conditions is fine by me. I use Lea & Perrins, and it's legit (according to How its Made) lol."
693130,krixxer,2012-05-04 23:36:00,274,I think I'll quit basa and teep on smoking.
693135,davey buoy,2012-05-04 23:44:00,5505,"Saw some breaded talipa at the market today,checked the box and couldn't find any information but nutritional specs. This basa thing has me scared of all that type of fish now. Think I'll stay with the wild haddock and pollok and such for now."
693147,Fisherman,2012-05-05 00:28:00,7201," If you want good fish, go see Johnnys Fish market on Bryne Dr.  Just a couple doors over from the Holiday Express."
693148,davey buoy,2012-05-05 00:35:00,5505," I'm not sure of holiday express,but I think I may of seen a sign opposite side near big al's?"
693149,misfish,2012-05-05 00:35:00,29133, Thats what I have been telling him Erich.  :wallbash:  :wallbash:
693167,davey buoy,2012-05-05 01:09:00,5505," LOL,Brian I will check out Johnny's soon. One of my sons works at No Frills so I either take him or pick him up every other day or so.Usually do a little shopping,and check out the inventory."
693171,Fisherman,2012-05-05 01:19:00,7201,"Hahaha, ya, go south on Bryne Dr, same side as the big water tower at the Ford dealer on Mapleview.   After watching some of those shows mentioned earlier, either I catch it from reasonably clean water or I go to Johnnys."
693173,misfish,2012-05-05 01:21:00,29133,  
692257,davey buoy,2012-05-02 18:58:00,5505,"When I got home yesterday decided to google where this fish came from as a buddy didn't know. Apparently this fish is a vietnamease catfish grown in river farms. Didn't know that at the time but was it tasty!,put in flour and run through egg bowl.Wow. Who would of thought and sold in some No frills."
692262,manitoubass2,2012-05-02 19:09:00,11391," I tried some last year and I found it to taste good but odd texture... I've never eaten any other catfish though, so maybe thats just how their flesh is???? Did you fry it or what was the cooking method?  Every once in awhile I'll try some fish from the supermarket for a change up. I usually end up with salmon or trout though.  That being said, I tried some tilapia the other day, two different ways, and it was pretty good. One was cooked like trout, the other just like typical walleye. Kids couldn't tell the difference.  The price had me wondering though, lol, $5.95 for 6 fillets????? I probably don't wanna see where the fish came from..."
692269,Roy,2012-05-02 19:14:00,13728,Nope. You really do not want to see where those things live and how they are handled before you eat them. Several documentaries about that.
692270,John,2012-05-02 19:14:00,2956,"Google it and see how they are raised,.......don't think you will eat it again."
692271,davey buoy,2012-05-02 19:14:00,5505," Same here,he bought 6 good fillets for about $6.50. Transportation and all?,I don't know,but when you try something and it's good,than find out the pricing it does make you wonder."
692273,misfish,2012-05-02 19:18:00,29133,"DAVEY,You got to go to Johnnys."
692281,davey buoy,2012-05-02 19:33:00,5505,"Also cooked up some wild haddock last night,Hmmmmmmm!"
692283,capt bruce,2012-05-02 19:35:00,820,"There are many many kinds of fish that taste good but we dont really know about them. My local fish&chip shop ,  you know the kind that serves Halibut and chips , when Halibut got very costly and the large fish were gone all he could buy were smaller ones with lots of waste to fillet ratio ,  has tried to sell other lessor known kinds . He has just got some fillets he calls ""BLUE COD "" I asked are the fillets Blue ?? lol .. Great tasteing white fleshed flakey fish ,can not really tell any difference between Halibut and this ""Blue cod"" , may be even better , 4 dollars cheaper and he said lots available ??? Remember when I ate my first small mouth early july water still cold we were only getting large eyes my dad would not harvest but the 1-2 pound  smallies we caucht in the same area went in the box, can not tell between these""s smallies  and the walleyes at lunch . Spring rock bass , crappies which is which , Perch , blue gills  ???? maybe gills are more work to fillet but easier to catch and in the pan TASTY TASTY, I challenge anyone blind folded to tell me which is which >> From some one who eats fish 5 out of 7 days a week dont be afraid to try diffent kinds of fish ,you do not need to stick to the more pressured kinds , many good tasteing fish , BUT !!!! I still cant swallow any carp ,tried it many ways and AHHHH some fish are best to catch but leave them in the water and CARP are ones that I feel fall into this group, gars and bowfins allso , but i did try them , like I said cooked many ways ,but ???? Im sure my 17 year old sons nikes cut up and battered have to taste better .. Fish the smart food , leave the spawners  , eat the teenagers and the les pressured kinds they dont call them PAN FISHH for nothing .."
692284,Pikeslayer,2012-05-02 19:36:00,1443,    DON'T DO IT !!!! DON'T LOOK !!!!  
692296,mercman,2012-05-02 19:48:00,7054,Pangasius. I used to eat it every week. untill i started glowing in the dark Bloody disgusting how and where they are raised.
692300,misfish,2012-05-02 19:57:00,29133, 
692302,lickmyarmpit,2012-05-02 20:00:00,359,Hahahahah they eat poop
692303,NAW,2012-05-02 20:00:00,4022,"Avatar says your from Barrie.  Head on down to Jerry Vanbeeks, the chip wagon in the Giant Tiger parking lot.  Basa and Poutine for under 10 bucks.  That'll clean you out!!!  I've had it once, and thought it was tasty.  No idea how they're raised though.  I only tried it because they where out of pickerel."
692305,snowdown,2012-05-02 20:05:00,24,i don't eat that for a long time.
692307,tonyb,2012-05-02 20:08:00,1637,"I've tried it as well, it was cheap at Costco.  They also have Tilapia loins for around the same price, but WHY are the fish not farmed on our continent?  It seems like so much of the store bought aquaculture originates from the far east, places like Indonesia and Vietnam...ugh  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture_in_Indonesia  I have to think even large predatory fish out of the great lakes would be better (less or equally contaminated) then these fish coming from the other side of the world!  Tilapia and to an extent catfish are a great sustainable food fish as they can be fed a primarily vegetarian diet.  Dorado are also a good choice for saltwater fish as they grow rapidly and reproduce in great quantities."
692325,Squid,2012-05-02 20:59:00,1656,Nice taste but I will never eat another one again after reading the articles on the internet.
692328,davey buoy,2012-05-02 21:07:00,5505," Brian,love fish since forever,but when someone offers me a fish I know nothing about and eats it regularilly,Plus still has all his motor skills and no added color,lol I just gotta try it .,but now finding out more about it,I'm thinking it's a one of."
692344,Christopheraaron,2012-05-02 22:02:00,3525,"Little scared of looking up the tilapia thing now, haven't gotten to try one yet. I do know that your not supposed to buy wild tilapia though because they are un-sustainable."
692347,Billy Bob,2012-05-02 22:06:00,5865,"WHY would any fishermen buy fish.......  They are free at every stream, river and lake in your area.....and much fresher then the store bought crap...."
692355,mercman,2012-05-02 22:27:00,7054,  So !!!! You lick your armpit
692358,davey buoy,2012-05-02 22:39:00,5505," Hey BB,sometimes i want a trout,sometimes a pickeral,even a perch. Sometimes you want a little snapper/redfish/cod/halibut,the list goes on. You have to buy it,I'm sure I can't catch a beautiful basa here! lol."
692360,Billy Bob,2012-05-02 22:43:00,5865,ENJOY....
692361,misfish,2012-05-02 22:50:00,29133," You keep fishing with me Davey,yer not keeping any.   BB, I  fish,but prefer not to eat fresh water for now."
692362,Billy Bob,2012-05-02 22:54:00,5865,Then just eat the fish from Lake Ontario....
