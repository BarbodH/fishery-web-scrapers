692727,lovetofish,2012-05-03 21:42:00,500,Myself and a few friends are going to Center Island to try for pike.  Not sure if it will be on Saturday or Sunday.  Anyone else going  LTF
692731,Christopheraaron,2012-05-03 22:23:00,3525,It'll have to wait until next week for me.
692779,Gregoire,2012-05-04 00:20:00,1397,"I'm hoping to make it out, but really busy. If I do get to the islands it will be in the evening."
692797,Christopheraaron,2012-05-04 00:50:00,3525,"Might be a change in plans, if there are it'll be sunday."
692889,lovetofish,2012-05-04 11:43:00,500,"Looks like we'll probably be there Sunday too.  Is it worth wearing hip waiters there?  If you see us, we'll be the guys with the  blue fisher price wagon. Feel free to say Hi!   LTF"
692897,Christopheraaron,2012-05-04 11:59:00,3525,"I wouldn't bring waders simply because the channels are fairly deep, if we go we'll be around ward's island."
692971,mepps,2012-05-04 14:49:00,1301,"I wish I could be there...at least the other half of Team Fury will be there!  I personally would recommend waders. I'm not sure what the water levels are, but waters will typically allow you to get into so areas you wont be able to otherwise."
693017,Christopheraaron,2012-05-04 17:22:00,3525," That's true and something I hadn't considered, there are lots of small islands are inaccessible by the trail and have ""private"" canals that no one without a boat can get to; but if you had waders......"
