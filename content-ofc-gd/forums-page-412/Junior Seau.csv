693136,manitoubass2,2012-05-04 23:48:00,11391,  Totally agreed with you and Blaque. I took no offense at all to this thread or his posts
693152,express168,2012-05-05 00:44:00,327,"I have played football and were around people who did use steroids and there was a definate effect on their personalty and the infamous "" roid rage"". I will agree that under the direction of medical personal and dosed correctly that steroids will have little effect but these people taking them as amateurs are not under proper supervision and are not dosing properly. They are following the direction of dealers essentially, not trained professionals and are causing damage to themselves as a result.  As far as Junior Seau is concerned do I think steroids had an effect, no but I am also not a medical professional. This man spent 20 years in the NFL as a linebacker experiencing impacts similiar to that of a car accident repeatedly on a daily basis. All of us who played football would have experienced that slight blacking out for a few seconds after a good hit before your vision and recognition came back if not yo never really hit anyone that hard. Now imagine that at an NFL level, I was a fan of Junior Seau and he was a true gentleman of the game. I can't imagine what he was experiencing to drive him to take his life but I know it could not have been pretty if it was enough to take him away from his children. Lets hope none of us have to experience what he was experiencing, RIP piece Junior. This is coming from someone who lost their own father to suicide and its not as simple as being a coward. I don't think it is a very easy decision for someone to take a bullet at their own hands."
693209,manitoubass2,2012-05-05 04:01:00,11391," Some very good points here, especially on the `coward`aspect.  Funny how you can notice `roid rage`though, when it`s a clinical anomaly. That being said, there is a distinct difference between anabolics and androgens, there ratios etc. What many people believe to be `roid rage`` is more often a psychological issue.  If one becomes moody and irritable, it`s usually from prolactin and progesterone, and other estradiols. Anabolics typically offer a sense of well being and calmness.  But certain steroids do increase aggression, but there hard to obtain and the aggressiveness ` is usually due to very high androgen content and binding affinity. These are not typically prescribed medications.  DHT based steroids are very different in action then anabolic type steroids. One reason professional athletes stayed away from androgens was that they often left joints feeling very stiff and dry, due to their lack of aromatization. They also have very short half lives and then, chemist altered the drug to extend half live via methylation. Methylation means it would bypass first pass metabolism in the liver, which would then make them mildly toxic. Not enough to kill you, but enough to show stress in liver values. This happened in the early 80`s, and is old news by now.  Again, I`m not trying to piss anyone off here, I`m just trying to educate and debunk very common myths  Also, before you condemn these compounds, maybe you should look into how many lives they save. AIDS patients, burn victims, the elderly, the list goes on...  Oh yeah, many a cancer patients as well, something I would think many on this board would appreciate, although it`s still very unfortunate set of circumstances.  and that bottom part is not directed at you express168... Just so you know"
693227,Gregoire,2012-05-05 11:34:00,1397,"Just saw that Junior's brain is being donated for research. Not sure what the results will be, but hopefully some answers will be found. If brain damage is found I think it would be a result of his football career. I do not know a lot about the research, but hope there is baseline data that is being used as a comparison."
693249,express168,2012-05-05 14:04:00,327,"Manitoubass2 ,I am never going to say that steroids are not valuable in medicine. They have definately helped many for treatment in many applications. As for my experiences with the other athletes around me at the time I can't say that their personalty changes were from the steroid use or just them acting that way because they felt more aggressive because they believed they were tougher by using them. I do not know what type they were using and didn't care as it was their decision, all I could say is that having known these people before, during and after their use I noticed different personalities and levels of aggression. I can't attribute the reasons for it but the timing all lined up with their use. No worries about anyones comments here as this is a tough thing to understand as most of us could never imagine taking our own lives (myself included)and I hope the thought never comes across any of our minds. I will remember Junior Seau as the player he was as he really beat up on my Raiders when he was in San Diego, great linebacker and was heavily involved in the community from what I had read about him. I really feel for his Mom after seeing that news conference, it is interesting that he is the 8th player to pass away from the 94 Superbowl Chargers."
693258,kickingfrog,2012-05-05 15:23:00,8333,"I love football and hockey. I played both as well as rugby. I loved hitting people. I loved hitting people HARD. When I watched these same sports I wanted to see hits, big hits, hits to hurt. I now feel some unease when I see these same hits. The impact these hits have on people's brains is serious and permanent. I'm not sure what the answer is. But we are going to see more consequences going forward, not less.  Brain injuries are not just a part of these body contact sports either. Female hockey with no body checking has some of the highest number of concussions. Concussions are also impacting baseball players as well.  I sometimes wonder about my own well being. I was never knocked out, never had any signs of a concussion but I did play a lot of games and never turned away from the rough stuff and initiated a lot of it. I can sit here right now and say I am fine, but in 20 years can I say the same thing? My son is 3 and likes to play hockey (his version at least) with me. I look forward to watching him play sports, but there is a part of me that wonders what if?  Nothing concrete here, just some Saturday musings while having a cup of joe."
693271,manitoubass2,2012-05-05 16:22:00,11391," Thats a great post, very logical.  The last sentence is troublesome.  Kickingfrog, I can understand where your coming from as well. All my kids (exception of my youngest daughter) all play sports. I'm worried too.  Me and fishgreg had a good discussion about kids and concussions as well..."
693286,uglyfish,2012-05-05 17:22:00,981,"Most people in the world will suffer at least one concussion in their lifetime and likely never even know it,  Sports are so popular and publicized that concussions are brought to the fore front. And used as a blame and scapegoat in many instances. But I would bet that the number of concussions in sports pales in comparison to those suffered in car accident, household accident, kids playing and just normal life.  Each person is different, it only takes a slight bump to the head to suffer a concussion for some people, sometimes head contact isn't even necessary for some concussions."
693322,kickingfrog,2012-05-05 20:10:00,8333,I'm not drawing any straight lines but this was in today's Globe and Mail.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/modern-pharmaceuticals-becoming-part-of-the-culture-in-the-nhl/article2423588/
693369,Gregoire,2012-05-05 22:33:00,1397,"This post has evolved into a great discussion. It really has made me reflect on the value er place on sports, and the effect that the violence that we celebrate can take on the lives of not just professional athletes, but also young amateur athletes. Uglifish I understand where you are coming from, and definitely take issue with people who use a slight injury as an excuse, or a means for litigation, but I think there is a legitimate issue with concussion in sport that needs to be expressed. For me a major difference between someone who suffers a concussion in an car accident and while playing a sport is that a car accident is seen by society as being a tragedy, whereas a concussion in sport is often a result of a violent collision that is often celebrated and sometimes even a direct result of direct teaching and instruction by a coach. Just think about it, you never have anyone say ""drive out there with you truck and knock the crap out of that civic."" You often hear ""you are bigger and stronger than that kid, knock the crap out of him."""
692655,Billy Bob,2012-05-03 17:59:00,5865," I used that reference as it directly dealt with NFL players...but here's even more info on the subject....  Addictive Potential  Animal studies have shown that AAS are reinforcing—that is, animals will self-administer AAS when given the opportunity, just as they do with other addictive drugs.3,4 This property is more difficult to demonstrate in humans, but the potential for AAS abusers to become addicted is consistent with their continued abuse despite physical problems and negative effects on social relations.5 Also, steroid abusers typically spend large amounts of time and money obtaining the drug: this is another indication of addiction. Individuals who abuse steroids can experience withdrawal symptoms when they stop taking AAS—these include mood swings, fatigue, restlessness, loss of appetite, insomnia, reduced sex drive, and steroid cravings, all of which may contribute to continued abuse. One of the most dangerous withdrawal symptoms is depression— when persistent, it can sometimes lead to suicide attempts.  http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/infofacts/steroids-anabolic-androgenic  BTW my oldest son is a doctor.  And I was on medical steroids....you get VERY edgy on them....and I was only on a medium strength prescription..."
692658,manitoubass2,2012-05-03 18:17:00,11391,"Unless your son is an endocrinologist with no bias, I don't see what that has to do with anything???  and if you were using prescription testosterone (a base steroid) and you suffered negative side effects such as moodiness, it was more than likely it was administered in a poor manner dose wise.  if/when you come off a steroid, you need to administer more drugs appropriately to get the body to start producing it's own testosterone again, like HCG or Clomid. Or you will have symptoms relative to zero testosterone production.  FYI, there are thousands of steroids all with unique effects and characteristics, ""doctors"" are not necessarily experts on the issue"
692661,mercman,2012-05-03 18:20:00,7054,"As much as i hate to agree  with BB, he is right. The question as to whether or not JR was on, or stopping steroids is one we may never know for sure. The stories on his untimely death are many, but from what i have read, suicide makes no sense. Officially no note. Spoke to his mother on the same day and sounded perfectly fine.(cant fool our moms)No real problems or depressive incidents to speak of. Gunshot wound to the chest? Accidental maybe, but people rarely shoot themselves in the chest, when trying to end thier lives.  Just doesnt sound right	A sad mystery."
692666,BillM,2012-05-03 18:29:00,17367,"An autopsy will show if steroids were still in his system..  Depending on the type, they could stick around for up to 3-4 weeks.  Also, people are forgetting this is the same guy that drove his Escalade off a cliff after having a fight with his gf."
692667,manitoubass2,2012-05-03 18:30:00,11391,"It's not a matter of whos right, lol.  For every study you show me with negative side effects, I can show you hundreds of the positives.  I wouldn't rule out it may have played a role, and it might not have. But it is far more likely there was other issues or drug use etc.  Your way more likely to die from NSAID use or even acetaminophen use then any steroid.  The mind works on a complicated system of neurochemistry, steroids alter neurochemistry indirectly, unlike SSRI's and other anti depressant drugs that are way more at risk of causing suicidal episodes.  It could even be the alteration of the ""risk/reward"" system and his neurotransmitor makeup that contributed to his condition.  I often wonder how ex professional athletes deal with things as they step away from that pedastle they are on. It must be a very tough thing to deal with mentally."
692668,manitoubass2,2012-05-03 18:32:00,11391,"RIP  anyhow, just a difference in opinions.  Lets get back to fishing, I wanna see more of those perch BB   "
692674,Gregoire,2012-05-03 18:50:00,1397,Really interesting debate here. I wish that the people who ran sports leagues were able to look at facts and express their opinions without offending or disrespecting others like you guys have. Just to add my input I think that brain trauma rather than steroid is likely to be a larger contributor if this was actually a suicide.
692681,manitoubass2,2012-05-03 19:14:00,11391,"fishgreg, in terms of the further study of concussions and their effects.  It's great that they are studying it in further detail, and obviously the science relating to it is improving, and thats a great thing. But this issue will never be fully understood, nor resolved.  Neurotransmitters are ridiculously complicated, to the point where even the experts in the field know very little.  They involve a lovely little lady named homeostasis, and they alter production, amounts etc very often, and are intricately correlated to our minds/bodies actions in millions of ways. They are altered also by millions of other factors, how we act, where we live, how we eat and the list carries on forever.  Thats part of the problem in studying these issues, there are simply too many factors involved to create studies that can show definitive answers. We can only create theories, and then test those theories. But even when an answer if found, it complicates the issue further, it doesn't resolve it.    and yes, it is a very interesting debate."
692687,Billy Bob,2012-05-03 19:26:00,5865, No I guess you are.....
692688,Billy Bob,2012-05-03 19:26:00,5865," Yes, I remember that."
692695,manitoubass2,2012-05-03 19:31:00,11391," Pharmacology and organic chemistry use to be a passion of mine.  I'm not a ""doctor"" though  Just poking fun, I don't mean any disrespect. Knowledge is power, or or them fighting words? lol  BillM, an autopsy probably won't show much in terms of steroids in ones system. The half life on most these drugs is remarkably short, with a few exceptions to the ester the compound is binded too.  What they look at is the ratio of testosterone to epitostosterone, then they basically guess. Sounds dumb, but it's totally true. Unless his numbers were tested prior, that all you can really do.  Most anabolic steroids are altered chemically from their pharmaceutical counterparts, so there is no baseline to test against. If the compound and its metabolites have not existed in a lab somewhere, there is no test that will show an ""unkown"" drug in your system.  Remember as well, there are numerous sub-types of steroids as well. So even if they say ""we found steroids!!!!"" it's very likely they are referring to steroids that aren't anabolic in nature, but more than likely a corticosteroids or something of the like.     "
692696,Billy Bob,2012-05-03 19:35:00,5865," It's just you're discounting everything I have produced.....but that's what makes the world go around....  Now I not saying concussions were ALSO not a part of it, as I'm sure it was...but also abuse of steroids could be a contributing factor...  I guess you're just living up to your handle ""master debator""...  And you should know you can't reason with a Redneck...."
692699,smally21,2012-05-03 19:41:00,993,hey mercman how does an appliance repair dude know so much about how/where people shoot themselves during the act of suicide?

Earlier in the thread, I typed about how my concussions effected my ability to get my thoughts across in a manner that can be understood, lol.  But it is a discussion of knowledge vs. opinion, so were bound to clash on our thoughts/experiences.  Again, alot of times, I either come off as an , or people can't understand what I'm saying, and thats not what I'm trying to convey at all.

692706,manitoubass2,2012-05-03 19:54:00,11391,"Just so people know,,,  When a clinical, double blind placebo trial is done, it is essential every side effect/illness/ailment is documented.  So what you end up with in many cases, are a list of side effects and possible issues that may not in fact be directed towards the drug being studied.  So a person/company/reporter can then use that information to spin it in a way they feel benefits them, or gets their agenda across, or get a drug to the market etc.  So unless you really understand pharmacology, it's very tough to make a valid point about the use/misuse of a compound, because you can show a study that proves anything you want it to prove, but that doesn't mean it's correct."
692780,uglyfish,2012-05-04 00:21:00,981,"Ya know... Sometimes, people just do stupid things!  Can't start blaming concussions and depression. Sorry, but that's just stupid. Especially the concussion aspect.  I played football, semi pro for years when I was younger. As well as in high school, and played hockey. I've suffered many concussions, and I also suffer(ed) from severe depression. And I'm still here. I didn't try to kill myself, nor did I think about it.  Those that do, are weak and just plain stupid and selfish. All there is to it!"
692790,Gregoire,2012-05-04 00:45:00,1397," I really think that are sending a message in this post that you did not intend, or that you are not seeing a connection that is clearly evident to others. If a history of concussions can lead to depression, than it is not a stretch to suggest that depression can lead to suicide. To claim that those who choose to end their lives are weak and selfish is a bit harsh in my opinion. Mental illness is a disease, and if not treated properly can lead to serious consequences. I do not know you, so I will not make assumptions about your life, and how you managed to recover from your concussion, but I do not think that just because you were able to overcome depression that you are justified in saying that people who commit suicide are weak and selfish."
692815,uglyfish,2012-05-04 01:42:00,981,"U don't over come depression, u learn to live with it. Concussions also take time to subside.  I suffered from depression before I was concussed the first time. So there is no direct connection there. And there is no proof what so ever to conclude that concussions cause depression.  As u said, u have ur opinion. I have mine. Which is fine, I wouldn't bash u for ur opinion. But having known someone who ended their own life, its a selfish act. Irreguardless of what u may or may not suffer from. It only hurts the ones left behind. Its a cowardly way to avoid dealing with ur illness."

What is scary with all this concussion stuff is that its extremely difficult to diagnose.. treatment for it isn't very advanced/proven  If my wife has anything to do with it, my boy wont play contact sports because of all this..I was pretty sure he would qb the bills to a superbowl..

A lot of lawsuits are being launched against the NLF over the issue of brain trauma and concussions. The NFL is taking this issue very seriously, look at how the rules are being changed with regards to blows to the head. I also do not think that a discussion regarding the long term effects of repeated brain trauma is futile, as it raises awareness of an important issue, and not only in football but in hockey as well."

That being said, Concussions or not, that doesn't really have a place in our discussion as to what happened.  Lately, there is alot of talk over suicide/death due to concussions, but there are so many other related factors....  We will never really know.  Anyone with half a brain knows what professional athletes endure. The physicality does play a part, but so does mentality, life, abuse etc...  I obviously have no idea what happened, but when things like this occur, the first thing I think of is the ""pedestal""  professional athletes are put on, and how the other factors play a part, then your career ends....  It has to play a hyyyyuge emotional role, and if you couple that with relationship factors, drug use, past family issues etc, it is my feeling that it's a recipe for disaster.  I just think it's time we as society look at everything as a whole to produce a conclusion. I think all these athletes/people deserve that and I believe that is fair treatment and helps a legacy.  Very easy to pinpoint one issue as the cause, when really everyone involved knows damn well the things that go on with professional athletes....  If you want to honor someone you cherished, give them the dignity of dying in their own way. Celebrate their life and accomplishments...  Don't tarnish them with hearsay and bull.

692480,Gregoire,2012-05-03 11:03:00,1397," Not sure what you meant by this, but I think that a discussion about whether Junior Seau may have permanently damaged his brain is very relevant and in no way tarnishes his legacy. Although I have no relationship with Junior Seau, I played football at a high level for 7 years in College and University. I am no where bear the physical specimen that Junior was, but I feel the long term effect of playing football on a daily basis. I was diagnosed with two concussions during my playing days, and am currently in my mid 30's, and know that my brain does not function at the same level as it once did. Please don't dismiss me as a dumb jock either, I earned an academic scholarship to a top Canadian university. I believe that I have direct experience with this issue. If you are dismissing the issue of brain trauma as a potential impact on Junior's death, especially if it was a suicide than I believe that you are the one who is tarnishing his legacy. A man's legacy should be the total accumulation of his life's work, not a snapshot of a point in history. Sorry to go on a bit on this topic, and I hope that you do not feel that this is an attack on you. As a person with direct knowledge of the long term impact that brain trauma can cause, and as a Amateur football coach I think that we should learn as much as possible about issues like concussions and football so that we can make the game that many people love as safe as possible. I do agree with you that as a society we need to look at why we put professional athletes on pedestal and how this may affect their lives. Just my 2 cents."

I too have an education, it doesn't hinder me from learning, just in the way I speak or type things out.  Concussions def. need to be taken very seriously and studied in far greater detail.  The point I'm trying to make is that it could very well be the issue that caused this tragedy, maybe not? Or it can be numerous factors or outside factors.  I was just peeved at the show I was watching and how they presented it. It immediately went into talks of studying head trauma and concussions as if the focus wasn't on his death, and I find that disrespectful.  Hopefully thats more understandable for you?

I do not have any children, but I struggle with whether I would let my son play football knowing the long term effects that it has had on my body. I know my father had the same struggles.

692636,manitoubass2,2012-05-03 17:34:00,11391,"@fishgreg,  You have to remember though it's a choice of the individual to pursue something they love. Some people will think similarly to you, and choose another profession/hobby, some won't. For some people doing what they love means everything, and health isn't going to stop that pursuit.  We go out in boats everyday and risk accidents their as well, no different then other sports on that level. We choose to do it, even with the risk of drowning etc. Same as other professions, firefighting etc. To them the risk is worth it, and they accept the short term/long term consequences of those decisions.  Anyhow, very tragic loss. Very talented athlete and by the sounds of it, an even greater person.  "

692638,Spiel,2012-05-03 17:34:00,9065," ""have"".....  and yes many drugs, steroids included will addle ones perception."
692639,BillM,2012-05-03 17:35:00,17367," And you think he was on roids while not playing in the NFL just because?  Chris, thanks for the spelling lesson.  My brain works faster then my fingers can type! LOL"
692646,Billy Bob,2012-05-03 17:45:00,5865,"Sorry but you are totally wrong....  The use of performance enhancing drugs and anabolic steroids dates back to the late 1960s in the National Football League (NFL). Denver Broncos defensive lineman Lyle Alzado was a more notable early incident on the NFL. In the last years of his life, as he battled against the brain tumor that eventually caused his death at the age of 43, Alzado asserted that his steroid abuse directly led to his fatal illness, but his physician stated it could not possibly be true. According to some reports, Alzado was using natural growth hormone, harvested from human corpses, as opposed to synthetic growth hormones. However, shortly before his death, Alzado recounted his steroid abuse in an article in Sports Illustrated. He said: “	I started taking anabolic steroids in 1969 and never stopped. It was addicting, mentally addicting. Now I'm sick, and I'm scared. Ninety percent of the athletes I know are on the stuff. We're not born to be 300 lbs or jump 30ft. But all the time I was taking steroids, I knew they were making me play better. I became very violent on the field and off it. I did things only crazy people do. Once a guy sideswiped my car and I beat the hell out of him. Now look at me. My hair's gone, I wobble when I walk and have to hold on to someone for support, and I have trouble remembering things. My last wish? That no one else ever dies this way.""[7]	” Jim Haslett was quoted saying that during the 1980s, half of the players in the league used some type of performance enhancing drug or steroid and all of the defensive lineman used them. One of the players from the Super Bowl winning 1979 Pittsburgh Steelers team confessed to using steroids before these statements, Steve Courson.[8] Courson was another lineman for the Steelers, and admitted to using steroids before his death in 2005. He also blamed a heart condition that he had on steroids. Some of his teammates, such as Jack Ham and Jack Lambert refused to use any kind of performance enhancing drug.[8]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid_use_in_American_football"
692648,Spiel,2012-05-03 17:51:00,9065," Just throwing it out there Bill.  While I've never taken steroids I've been fed a number of prescription drugs over the years for chronic pain and jumped off everyone of them because of the personality change I felt with everyone. In many cases they made me angry, somewhat violent, depressed and not overly well in the least, not to mention that almost all of them did nothing in terms of treating the issues they were prescribed for!"
692649,manitoubass2,2012-05-03 17:53:00,11391,"Billybob,  wiki is a useful tool, but not so much when it comes to science.  anyone that has an understanding of the endocrine system and neuro chemistry would understand where I'm coming from.  but lets save that for a more appropriate thread"
692651,BillM,2012-05-03 17:55:00,17367,"From what wiki link I don't see a single professional source that states steroid use lead directly to anyone of those issues.  Too many opinions and not enough facts.  Also BB, HGH and steroids are two very different things."
