692494,Fish Farmer,2012-05-03 11:44:00,2234,"Just a heads up, Walmart has their Ever Start Deep Cycle 27DC-850N on sale starting May 4th for $87.00 Down from $107.00"
692496,mercman,2012-05-03 11:50:00,7054,great deal. I have been using one for 2 years on my trolling motor with no problems at all.
692497,Spiel,2012-05-03 11:52:00,9065,"I'll stick with Acme Battery on Parkdale Ave, regardless of cost."
692499,Fish Farmer,2012-05-03 11:56:00,2234,"Same here, I've never had one that holds a charge as long as that one.  Maybe I'm just lucky"
692540,soobnoob,2012-05-03 13:36:00,55,so if you had to pick one between the walmart and the costco deep cycle batteries... which is better? I need one for a 44 lb MK
692546,dave524,2012-05-03 13:50:00,4508," If I had to go back under warranty I would rather go to Costco, they have always been outstanding on their warranties"
692554,Roy,2012-05-03 14:21:00,13728,Both Kirkland and EverStart batteries are manufactured by Johnson Controls. There are basically only 3 manufacturers of 12volt automotive/marine batteries. Go with the retailer's after sales service. I've had good luck with Energizer/Everstart in the DC grp 27 bracket.
692711,Fisherman,2012-05-03 20:02:00,7201," And pray tell, who makes Acme Batteries or are you just pushing the dealer?"
692825,moemoe,2012-05-04 02:12:00,352,"acme sells GNB-great northern battery and deka, great luck with dekas from there, very poor results with the gnb batteries and had one fail in the car too"
692910,hirk,2012-05-04 12:31:00,571,"Like Roy said only a few manufacturers, I only know of johnson controls and east penn. Batteries are branded and made to spec by them but they are not all the same, plate thickness and cell insulation can vary so not all wet cells are created equal."
692947,Nipfisher,2012-05-04 13:58:00,2449,  For me....Walmart is down the road and Costco is down the highway (in Sudbury). Easy choice.
692948,tonyb,2012-05-04 14:00:00,1637, Just visited them yesterday
693292,bassfighter,2012-05-05 17:42:00,366,"Costco discontinued their Deep cycle battery last year, I pressume lots of return from consumers not managing their deep cycle or car battery, then returning it. However,Costco does not lose money nor care for the returns, the manufacturer have to eat the losses. They brought it back due to demands from their customer.  In terms of warranty, Costco all the way. 1 year free or 48months prorated warranty on their battery, no question asked, just show your receipt. They do not even re-test the battery when you returned them. Deep cycle seldom last that long becuase of abuse on the battery. What if customer return their batteries every 3 years, and get new batteries. Poor manufacturer have to deal with it!  Walmart has 24 months warranty only. One year free replacement."
693421,Dutch,2012-05-06 04:17:00,831,Does Walmart sell a 31 DC?  I don't think Costco does either.
