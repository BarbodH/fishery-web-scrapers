693394,Dan668,2012-05-06 00:36:00,1120,Go Diaz. Not sure why barry gave up the full mount. Lavar is a joke on the ground
693397,Dan668,2012-05-06 00:43:00,1120,Awesome. I bet on Belcher. Pretty sweet odds. All palhares has is leg locks
693398,woodenboater,2012-05-06 00:50:00,2277,"yeah, Nate has mad skills so hopefully a good fight. Belcher ? Gotta say I  was worried when he started playing footsie with Palhares but what an amazing ground game they had going on. Helluva finish. So far, great finishes tonight even though they're all first rounders."
693401,Dan668,2012-05-06 01:58:00,1120,Good fights.
