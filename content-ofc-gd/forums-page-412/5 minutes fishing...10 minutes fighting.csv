They fought about who had the bigger branch, who would hold the worms, the little one (Karter) doesn't like to be helped by big brother (Alex).  Karter wanted to cross the road several times as we were fishing on a bridge and the suckers were running under it.  Anyways, we managed to get 2 on and landed one. Never measured it but probably around 17"". Hook and worm.       "
692819,Joeytier,2012-05-04 01:53:00,3990,haha. Isn't that the bridge just down the hill from your place?  Sweet!
692820,Nipfisher,2012-05-04 01:55:00,2449,  Yep. They are running right through the city. Not a full run yet. Just starting.

692823,Rod Caster,2012-05-04 02:03:00,5784,Cut bait!  thanks for the invite.... as it turns out I'm the sucker for trying for inland 'bows again tonight. All I got was a canoe full of rain water. Man those inlanders are starting to piss me off.

692826,Nipfisher,2012-05-04 02:24:00,2449,  All those new places are built on the old rail lands.
