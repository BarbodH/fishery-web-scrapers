Apparently Cliff lake nearby is a walk through the bush to get to. Can anyone comment on their experiences at the camp good or bad and if it is possible to portage to cliff lake to fish also. Thanks, Dan"

The 2 of them will only catch 6-8 eyes on a weekend trip. They have fished the lake for more than 10 years and still can't locate any #s. Just the odd one here and there. Average size of the ones they caught last summer were 22""-24""."
