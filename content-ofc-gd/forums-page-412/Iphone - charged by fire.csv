692297,Terry,2012-05-02 19:50:00,14456,I like it great for fly-ins
692334,Nipfisher,2012-05-02 21:30:00,2449,I think it is cool. $129 for a charger though?
692336,colin519,2012-05-02 21:34:00,101,Unlimited iPod tunes on a 7 day+ camping/fishing trip is worth 129 bucks. Recharging a headlamp or a GPS is pretty cool as well.
692337,jedimaster,2012-05-02 21:34:00,3472,I have a solar charger that I got for 20 bucks. Works like a charm and keeps my blackberry ticking away for a week while hunting.
692346,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-02 22:03:00,10439,  A charger you can cook your morning bacon and eggs on!!! As well as fire up the stove top expresso maker!!!!
692351,Christopheraaron,2012-05-02 22:16:00,3525,"Great idea! I use my moms iphone all of the time for maps, I like the solar powered idea too though."
692472,Stoty,2012-05-03 09:32:00,2910,"OMG.... unreal!!!!! I was wondering how I can charge my iPhone and GoPro Hero 2 camera while in the interior of Algonquin! I guess I have my answer! $129 is a great price, IMO! I think I'm gonna reserve one.... wifey doesnt need to know (yet). LOL"
692486,mercman,2012-05-03 11:31:00,7054,  Good coffee while reading an ebook in the forest and listening to i-tunes. My kinda adventure
692567,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-03 14:52:00,10439,  If it only had enough power to run my expresso machine life would be grand!!!!
692595,Twocoda,2012-05-03 16:06:00,4130,i find it kind of exciting to see the spin off technology this little gadget may have started... a few ideas pop into my mind
692608,smally21,2012-05-03 16:21:00,993,"awesome. gene roddenberry would never have forecasted this marvel.  there is nothing like ""getting away from it all""  - can't go camping without an iphone!"
692614,ch312,2012-05-03 16:32:00,1590," yes, but it may take a while for that solar panel to heat up some water for coffee and i dont think you'll won't be charging much when it's dark out. you get a small stove and a charging unit with infinite fuel that works whenever you want it to. no matter how you slice it, this is a cool toy at a reasonable price."
692615,mercman,2012-05-03 16:32:00,7054,  The technology is still new.Give it a year
692626,jedimaster,2012-05-03 17:20:00,3472,Imagine how good this would be for the environment if every cellphone was charged by burning wood.
692662,Twocoda,2012-05-03 18:23:00,4130,
692670,jedimaster,2012-05-03 18:38:00,3472,"Ok fine, but I only mention it because the website mentions how much pollution is caused by burning fossil fuels...If you're going to present yourself as being green,  shouldn't you actually be green?"
692686,Jds63,2012-05-03 19:25:00,1365, Thats exactly what I thought when I saw this .... yikes
692725,Twocoda,2012-05-03 21:18:00,4130,"its possible there will be a propane version down the road or existing one could be modified for the people that like to carry extra supplies with them...i think the idea is really neat...i think if it was listed in a ""survival"" section might make a few people more cool with it..."
692759,Stoty,2012-05-03 23:46:00,2910,"Just talked to the wife, and I'm getting one!! Can't wait!!"
