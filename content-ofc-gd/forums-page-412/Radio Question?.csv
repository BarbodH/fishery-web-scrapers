Has worked for me for the past 20 years ..... My old radio has seen better days but still works and sounds great .  Randy "

Often the external antenna on a transistor radio is for FM, the AM antenna is a bar wound with wire internal inside the radio, I've got better results wrapping the radio end of the antenna wire around the radio for AM reception. Used to pick up a lot of Midwest US AM stations at night from Haliburton."
