693141,TDunn,2012-05-05 00:13:00,680,Awesome adventure! next time you and that HD guy should check out LSPP..... I`d love to have you two up here slamming trout...   TDunn
693145,solopaddler,2012-05-05 00:20:00,8605,  Well....actually it's funny you say that Tyler. Was talking about a trip up there later in May!
693185,Paulus,2012-05-05 02:11:00,522,"Spectacular adventure and story, dubes! ... I mean Dudes!  Funny. Almost as much as the brookies, what makes me want to go there is the campsite, complete with pine needle rug & vista over the lake.  Must've been terrible going to sleep at night without the sounds of cars, trains or planes going by...  ...just kidding of course.  Thanks for sharing your story-telling skills with us again, Mike. Always a pleasure to read!  p.-"

Then at the right time divine intervention provides the trip saving duct tape. Unbelievable! You both were justly rewarded with the finest for those tribulations.  Lucky to have met you both;  it added depth to the story.  Many thanks!        "

693388,TDunn,2012-05-06 00:07:00,680,  let me know if you begin to make plans TDunn
693390,danc,2012-05-06 00:18:00,4677,Thanks for the great report and anticipation Mike. You know where I'll be in two weeks.
693433,solopaddler,2012-05-06 11:29:00,8605,"  Thanks Erik, glad you enjoyed.    I'm working on it feverishly. Any chance you have any pull with my wife? LOL!    Throwing soft plastics for giant pike way in the back end of Gull bay?"
692682,misfish,2012-05-03 19:15:00,29133,Great read and fish Mike and Fidel.  Thanks for sharing.
692683,quickme,2012-05-03 19:15:00,261,fantastic read!!  It felt like i was right there with you guys..
692691,Leecher,2012-05-03 19:29:00,7832,Talk about persistence    Kudos to you both Thanks for sharing your adventures with us Mike
692705,Joeytier,2012-05-03 19:54:00,3990,"Excellent stuff.  A story of a lifetime for some, but I'm sure you could rhyme off a bunch more tales just as exciting.  Amazing narration to boot."
692712,Terry,2012-05-03 20:06:00,14456,"wow, that could have been pretty nasty with the holes in the canoe glad it worked out and sounds like a good time"
692713,solopaddler,2012-05-03 20:16:00,8605,"It's funny how some threads will capture peoples imagination and compel them to respond. It's either an interesting angling tale, or more usually something more mundane like ""what's your favourite brand of cereal?"" LOL!  I'm glad you guys enjoyed the story!      Missed you on this one buddy.    Possibly Craig, but if you carry the canoe, you'd also have to carry the light pack (about 60lb's).    I've made it before. Sliced paper thin and marinated in lime juice and various spices it's pretty amazing.     Most likely even better. The water will be warmer, there'll be more hatches and they'll be more active.  Just make sure you bring lots of bug dope."
692717,misfish,2012-05-03 20:24:00,29133," Mike,how big do you roll them for a bug?"
692721,solopaddler,2012-05-03 20:40:00,8605, I think I'll pass this one off to Highdrifter.
692741,Whitespinnerbait,2012-05-03 22:59:00,2038,Stunning report to say the least  .............might even outdo a Moosebunk report !!!

692744,Slop,2012-05-03 23:08:00,151,Fidel slayin with the plastics n slip floats...oh the horror!  One thing about Fidel that stands out when we both worked in fishing tackle circles was his infectious passion for the sport...nothing has changed I see.  Thanks for sharing this one solo...it was most enjoyable to read.
692752,Tomcat,2012-05-03 23:29:00,395,Great report (as usual) Mike. Outstanding spec pics too. Thanks for sharing.

692768,trevy727,2012-05-04 00:04:00,351,"Great story! That's crazy how the canoe cart put those holes in the canoe. I've been so busy with work and my new boat that I didn't even get a chance to fish opening weekend. My buddy and I are heading into the park tomorrow morning. I'm still interested in hooking up Mike, and talking fishing. Lots of time for that though."
692769,highdrifter,2012-05-04 00:04:00,2534, Aahhh... you remembered!!
692772,solopaddler,2012-05-04 00:10:00,8605, Well I was gonna say...you could roll about a million teeny tiny microscopicically small dubes and pass them out to all the bugs. Get 'em so screwed up they don't want to bite.  Only problem is what happens when they get the munchies?!!     Good luck in the park Trev. Would love to get together at some point.
692798,BillM,2012-05-04 00:51:00,17367,"Another adventure where duct tape saved the day...  Mike, there's a pattern starting to be established!  LOL!"
692802,misfish,2012-05-04 00:58:00,29133," LMAO.  As for the munchies,wake fidel up to catch a shore fish and YOU, cook it up. Atleast he knows where the fish are.LOL"
692856,WeedLine,2012-05-04 04:11:00,322,Great story and great fish guys...you earned them
692874,solopaddler,2012-05-04 10:55:00,8605,  I had to think about that for a second. You know I totally forgot about patching the boat with foam and duct tape the last time we chased brookies LOL!  Third times a charm! (I'll bring a Costco sized roll of tape this August.  )
692902,Spiel,2012-05-04 12:15:00,9065,So what is your favourite brand of cereal Mike?

692458,Musky or Specks,2012-05-03 04:30:00,2710,5k portage hell and then discovering not one but two holes in your canoe. I just about cried right along with you two. Way to save the day from your fellow campers. 1 1/2 on the way out is very impressive as were the fish. Thanks for the report.
692465,highdrifter,2012-05-03 05:05:00,2534,Mike you're making me re-live every blissful moment from our trip..  Each and every agonizing and blissful moment.  Totally epic opener budday!  You're awesome company to have in the brush.  cheers HD
692466,Nemo,2012-05-03 05:11:00,727,Hey I recognize that spot.  A Truly unique Ontario experience.  And probably one of the only places in the world where you can roll up and catch trophy brookies 2-3 hours from Toronto.  Also your guide was not too shabby (minus the canoe issue) LOL.  I would pump/hump through 5 k of bush for that any day......  Call me any day you need a porter...  Nemo
692468,Jet,2012-05-03 06:18:00,364,"Now's that's some real fishing! I had the old guys from Toronto huffing and puffing when fishing the rivers here. All I kept hearing was ""What is this mountain goat stuff?!?"" I definitely had to accept that you walk a lot longer and on much less beaten - and often steep - paths to fish here. Your determination is a testament to your commitment to this great pastime.  And those moments of ""good luck"" often seem to happen for a reason when fishing - reminding us how lucky we are and the satisfaction of helping another and being helped. In the past year alone I got swept down a river attempting a tricky river crossing and got stuck in the snow ice fishing a remote lake where I saw no one the last two times I had gone. I was over 20 km away from the nearest highway, solo, and with absolutely no cell service. I thought I was royally screwed and I had just arrived. To my ""good luck"" someone actually showed up that day, had me out in a few and I was on my way fishing once again.  Thanks for the reminding me about those lucky moments."
692479,bobowski,2012-05-03 11:01:00,360,Awesome report! Those Brookies are some beauty looking fish.
692483,solopaddler,2012-05-03 11:28:00,8605,"I'm gratified that you guys enjoyed the story. Some of the comments lead me to believe that perhaps I should take a bit more time with the writing, and I mean that in a good way. As per usual I whipped off the report in about an hour at work last night.  Anyhow thanks for the comments gents.     A chestnut prospector? Ouch!  As far as the cart goes, it's fine. Apparantly if you pull a couple of pins out you can rotate the pads upwards, higher than the wheels and lock them in place. Who knew?    You know what? All the fish were very similar in size, they were all beauties. That last pic of Fidel does make the fish look extra big though LOL!    I'm pretty sure you're right.    Brad, at some point we need to fish together!     So....remember that other lake I told you about? It's a bit of a longer drive, a bit harder to access, but so loaded with fish.  Let's do it! HAHA!    Thanks Nemo!    Would love to hear some more detail. You're a man after my own heart sir."

692537,I'mHooked,2012-05-03 13:33:00,525,"Looks like an alright trip, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing.  I was chomping at the bit waiting for the report! Spectacular outing!  Without a doubt one of the best experiences of my life was as an 8 day Algonquin trip when 18. Although sadly that was 20+ years ago and the last time I've been to the park.  Hopefully it goes without saying, if you want to share another 5k portage, just let me know when and where! (I'll carry the canoe)  Also, as previously noted, excellent writing!"
692541,Jds63,2012-05-03 13:37:00,1365,"Algonquin holds many untold stories, but thanks for sharing that one. I wish i had kept better accounts of the trips I took, mostly just memories now. I really need to get back there.  This winter we had lake trout Ceviche on the ice in Temagami, that Brookie would have been real nice to try that recipe on."

692403,solopaddler,2012-05-03 01:16:00,8605,"In fishing, especially brook trout fishing, there are never any guarantees and from time to time I've been known to follow a hunch.  An offhand remark by the kid pumping my gas, a chance conversation with a fellow tripper, or simply staring at a map for hours and deciding that a certain lake needed to be fished for no particular reason.  Regardless of the inspiration oftentimes chasing trout takes a giant leap of faith. Sometimes it pays off, many times it doesn't.  My tripping partner Fidel was blissfully ignorant of my lake choosing criteria, relying solely on my perceived experience to lead us to fish.  Of course I said nothing to temper the lads enthusiasm. 15 years my junior and full of the boundless energy of a youthful sherpa, I had to keep his spirits up.  I had decided upon a particularly remote lake with over 5km of portaging required to access it. You do know what they say right? The quality of the fishing rises in direct proportion to the difficulty required to access it. Well...usually it does.  Anyhow I'd heard rumours that the trail was in good shape and decided to try and utilize my canoe cart for as long as we could.  It's always easier pulling canoe and gear in on a cart rather than carrying...usually.  We were well into our 4th hour of hauling when the kid began to falter, ""Are you sure we're headed the right way?"", ""I'm not sure how much longer I can take this!""  The countless deadfalls, muddy bog holes and seemingly endless uphill climbs weren't helping matters.  ""Don't worry, one way or another we'll make it, trust me!"" I said this in between gigantic gulps of air and with sweat streaming down my brow.  I have to admit I was starting to get slightly worried. By my reckoning we should have been at the lake over an hour ago. Somewhere I was certain we had taken a wrong turn.  This particular part of the Park you see is interlaced with a network of old logging roads, park roads, and portage trails, many times overlapping.  I was reasonably certain that about an hour previously we should have zigged instead of zagged and now here we were: early evening with the sun sinking low in the horizon and the temperature dropping fast.  I made an executive decision at that point to ditch the cart and carry our stuff in on a rough trail that headed west.  With our strength waning faster than the weak spring sunshine we were overwhelmingly relieved to stumble upon the east shoreline of the lake 15 minutes later.  Tired or not we hustled to launch the canoe and load our gear. Our sole priorities now being find a campsite, light a fire and cook some food.  It's hard to describe exactly what transpired next. Suffice it to say we were dealt a crushing blow.  As I prepared to slide the canoe into the lake we both gasped in horror.  Apparantly the carts wheels had been rubbing on the underside of the canoe, enough that they'd worn two perfect tire shaped holes into the underside of the canoe.  Now normally this could be overcome quite easily with duct tape which I always have on hand.  Unfortunately I failed to pack any this time.  ""What do we do now?"" The kid grouched. His spirits were finally being crushed...  I was truly at a loss for a moment then realized that in all probability there was another group already camped on the lake. According to the Park reservation line another party was slated to be camped on the lake at the same time.  Fidel stayed behind, as in his words ""There's no need for both of us to drown!"".  Meanwhile I jammed a lifejacket as best as I could into the holes, and with a knee pressing down on each of them I paddled off alone in search of help.  The wind was brisk from the north as I skated across the lake and around a mainlake point. I was taking on a bit of water, but not enough to stop me yet.  I picked up the pace instantly relearning long lost skills as I leaned into the side of the boat and pulled my paddle blade deeper and faster.  In a protected cove exactly where I expected them to be I saw the smoke from a campfire and a large group of guys milling around.  Turns out they were a truly fantastic group of individuals and were more than happy to help.  They pulled my lame canoe up onto shore, helped me out and after a minute of explaining on my part they went to work.  One of the guys handed me a stiff drink and I watched while another opened a pack and pulled out several rolls of tape. He could have opened a duct tape store.  Within minutes they'd dried the boat inside and out and applied two different layers of tape to both sides.  Yes indeed, I do believe that sometimes a higher power watches over us.     Before leaving to collect Fidel and our gear I snapped this quick pic of our new friends. What a great bunch of guys and truly kindred spirits!     I thanked them profusely before departing. If not for them I really have no idea what we'd have done.  To say Fidel was happy is a bit of an understatement. Deliriously flabbergasted might be more apt.  We wasted no time loading the boat and in short order we found an open campsite, pulled in and set up shop.      In no time at all we had a roaring blaze going, dinner on the stove, and a couple of drinks poured.  The winds died down and we enjoyed a truly spectacular, albeit short, Algonquin evening.        When the sun finally sank below the horizon it quickly became unbearably cold. With the temperature slated to dip to minus 11 it was a good thing we'd stoked the furnace with a big meal.  Regardless I think we'd have both slept soundly curled up under a bush. We were whipped.  The next morning after some seriously strong java and a bit of food we were eager to fish. It was after all opening day.  As a young lad of 9 or 10 opening day held more magic for me than Christmas morning. I'd spend the months leading up to it daydreaming of what was to come.  Of course back then we didn't fish for trout before the opener. These days with extended seasons, plenty of year round opportunities, and the means to fish them the opener has lost a bit of its luster.  Still the excitement is still there, the flames just need to be fanned now and again.  It was opening day and we were on a wild brook trout lake deep in the interior of Algonquin Park. That was enough for me.  We quickly pushed off and began to work the lake. Despite the minus temps the sun was shining brightly and our spirits were soaring.  It was a beauty of a lake too, typically tannin stained, rocky, and ringed with countless fallen trees, usually a surefire hotspot for spring brookies.  Fidel was the first to connect. Dangling a small plastic shad bait next to an enormous fallen cedar at the end of a long cast, a chunky trout shot out from underneath and hammered his lure right beside the boat.        I struck next with another healthy specimen that hit a #2 perch colored E.G.B. spoon as I fluttered it past a giant boulder.    From that point on it was fairly consistent with a total of 12 gorgeous chunky brookies coming to the net.  Fidel led the way with 7 all on his favourite plastic bait.      Picture taking wasn't a huge priority for us on this day, in fact I don't think Fidel snapped a single one so we have mostly memories of this truly great opener.  Considering all the strife we endured getting in the previous day we were more than satisfied when we headed in early evening to stoke the fire and fry up a couple of trout.    I put the blade to two of the chunkier specimens and was simply awed by the flesh: bright orange and firm, I believe we could have eaten it raw.    Dusted in flour then sauteed in butter with some fresh dill and a bit of lemon pepper, it truly doesn't get any better!    While I puttered around the stove cooking our dinner and stoking the fire Fidel, keener that he is refused to give up.  He rigged his rod with a float, split shot, hook and worm and lobbed it out.  ""Buddy, you're wasting your time!"" I yelled over from the fire, ""It's way too shallow out in front of our camp!""  Thankfully the lad ignored me and proceeded to land 6 healthy fish before dinner was ready.  Here's the first for posterities sake.   <iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Hfkunc_ODzM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>      I was incredibly happy for him considering what I'd put him through, and I have to say his excitement is infectious!  I enjoyed the show from my perch near the fire, drink in hand, and honestly couldn't imagine a more perfect end to the day.  The next morning we caught a couple more fish, fittingly one each, before we packed up and headed out.  Thankfully everything from that point on was anticlimactic. We found the actual portage trail and carried rather than carted our way out.  Fidel had the heavy pack with the cart bungeed on top and I carried the lighter pack and canoe.  We made incredible time as well I thought, traversing the entire 5 plus kilometer length in 11/2 hours.  It's nice to know I still have it in me.  Big thanks goes out to Fidel (Highdrifter on the board). Sir you are an outstanding young man and a true pleasure to trip with.  It's not often I run across someone like Fidel with the same sensibilities as mine. You're a good man and a real trooper, 'till next time buddy.   Cheers,  Mike"

692407,woodenboater,2012-05-03 01:30:00,2277,"What an awesome TR ! I don't think there's any opener like a spring opener in The Park. 5 km of carrying hell really does get you closer to nirvana doesn't it ?  I was waiting for a punchline to your story and was bowled over when I saw the photos of the wheel worn canoe lol ! Thank god you found the other group or else you and Fidel woulda been looking for pitch and ripping up clothes  And yeah, those are some absolutely gorgeous brookies you landed. I like the way you do your trout, some flour, butter and some heat. Way better than trad shore lunches imo."

692417,mirogak,2012-05-03 01:52:00,387,What a nice read ... like a novel. Thanks Mike.  As I was reading about them fallen trees in your report I remembered the fallen trees on my lake and the splashes around them.  Nostalgia already? Can't be.  And I bet you could have eaten those fish raw.  And that frying pan pic of yours was truly torturous.  Thanks and keep it up. Miro

Can't beat the kindness of folks up in Algonquin, I remember once we packed up for a last second trip, we managed to call ahead and they said that they had lots of space, wouldn't you know it it was almost completely booked up! While looking around the lake a large group called us over, said that they claimed 2 sites and that if we needed one to come over!"

692427,mercman,2012-05-03 02:18:00,7054,A true adventure Mike. Not many of us can say we have had one. You truly live a blessed life. Thanks for sharing part of it with me.   Paul
692431,solopaddler,2012-05-03 02:33:00,8605,"Glad you enjoyed fellas, and Mike, anytime you feel up to it let me know."
692432,Peps,2012-05-03 02:33:00,191,Fantastic read Mike
692433,spinnerdoc,2012-05-03 02:34:00,556,"I really enjoyed reading this report Mike... like the gentleman above had said...it's like reading a novel, you could be Hemmingway"
692435,Hooked,2012-05-03 02:48:00,891,"Tough break on the canoe in the beginning, glad some good karma worked out for ya's.  Definitely a trip for troopers and purist considering the actual time spent and work to get to your site.  Hardcore stuff.  Sometimes it's great to be proven wrong....sometimes. I was lucky enough to of met Fidel at Lakair once, a good guy indeed."
692439,torco,2012-05-03 02:53:00,656,Great report. I am always impressed by yours (and others on the board) ability to tell a good story.
692442,rocheleauc,2012-05-03 02:58:00,205,"wow that was great, thanks for sharing that with us, looks like it was a great time"
692444,Moosebunk,2012-05-03 03:18:00,3970,"A pleasure this one is Mike.  The essence of what fishing boards should be about.  And yes, I am impressed and not surprised that you ""still have it in you."""
692446,Rod Caster,2012-05-03 03:22:00,5784,"I can relate to your canoe mishap.  My Dad and I once had to mend a punctured Chestnut Prospector with kerosene-can-wrapped duct tape, sandwich bags and bubble gum. It was an uncomfortable situation at the time, but we were ultimately rewarded with humility and a good story. The spec fishing was great as well!  Just another chapter in your book of adventures, eh? I guess a re-think is needed for your canoe-cart; you're not likely to smell melting canoe when your pulling it  thanks for sharing."
692447,Moosebunk,2012-05-03 03:24:00,3970,Ohhh and to add.  Fidel... way to slay the shore and boat fish dood!  That last pic and fish is a beauty man.
692450,kickingfrog,2012-05-03 03:31:00,8333,"Great tale. Beautiful fish. Mr. Brice would have had a chuckle, and maybe a shake of the head, about that trip."
692451,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-03 03:36:00,2690,I've been waiting for this one.  Thanks for a great bed time read. Truly beautiful brookies and quite the adventure to boot.
692452,Sinker,2012-05-03 03:39:00,8692,Great report! There is nothing better than spring specks!!  S.
