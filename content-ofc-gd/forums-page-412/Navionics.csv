692575,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-03 15:05:00,10439,"  So you don't think Nunavut, the NWT and Yukon are not part of Canada?"
692579,Stoty,2012-05-03 15:17:00,2910,"Wow, you dont give up eh. Let's try this again....  Covers A LOT of Canada & US,"
692585,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-03 15:37:00,10439," Sure, if you think 40% of Canada is a lot. OK, I agree.    :tease:"
692591,BillM,2012-05-03 16:01:00,17367,"It's the 40% of Canada no one really cares about, lol."
692610,pylon,2012-05-03 16:25:00,68,Hard to drag the pc out on the lake though
692618,manitoubass2,2012-05-03 16:59:00,11391, Probably why its a great area to fish...   
692689,Live2fish85,2012-05-03 19:27:00,1633,I have it on my phone and its awesome. I use it all the time.
692694,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-03 19:31:00,10439,  Until the rooskis start drilling for oil and mining up there and claiming it as theirs.  The 40% is where you live Bill the other 60% is North of 60*.
692760,Stoty,2012-05-03 23:48:00,2910,"Can never please everyone..... Point is...has most of the areas that most people would need. Sux if it doesn't cover what area certain ppl need, but those are the breaks!"
691428,Dan668,2012-04-30 14:51:00,1120,I have maps for my Hds. But I wanted to buy paper maps or navionics app for when I'm away from the boat to figure out areas that I'll fish on the next trip. I don't fish a big variety of lakes but plan to try out others which are all popular lakes and are on the app.  Does the app run well on an Android phone? Is it worth purchasing
691430,whiskywizard,2012-04-30 14:56:00,305,"I have it on an iPhone and an iPad. I have friends with it on Android devices. It runs perfectly, and is soooo worth buying!  It is a super bargain. The latest version was just released and is back up on the various e-stores."
691435,tknohpy,2012-04-30 15:10:00,162,I run it on Android and love it
691440,MSBruno,2012-04-30 15:39:00,369,get the computer version and print screen
691441,kickingfrog,2012-04-30 15:40:00,8333,No problems on my Android phone. I'm just worried I'll drop my phone in the drink and won't be able to call in sick.
691465,Dan668,2012-04-30 17:08:00,1120,Didn't notice they had a pc version. Will my sd card with hot spots premium be open able on the computer? If not I may look into purchasing the pc version instead
691500,OutdoorDan,2012-04-30 18:28:00,325,I still don't understand if we can take the chip out of the GPS and run it on a computer or not.  It would help a lot with re-naming/organising a lot of spots I have marked.
691501,BillM,2012-04-30 18:29:00,17367, You can with Navionics $129 program
691503,OutdoorDan,2012-04-30 18:32:00,325,"Thanks, Bill."
691594,OutdoorDan,2012-04-30 20:34:00,325,"Sorry for dumbing up this thread, but I am still confused.  I downloaded the Navionics PC app.  It was free since I already had the Gold edition for the plotter.  So, the chart opens fine from my computer, but when I go to import data from the card, no files of the type it can import show up.  It's a Hummingbird 788ci.  Are the waypoints saved locally by default and not to the card with the Navionics chip?"
691778,BillM,2012-05-01 02:33:00,17367," You shouldn't be writing to the Navionics card, your finder has 2 card slots, put an empty card in the slot and save it to that.   Waypoints are saved on the unit itself, not the card.  You'll have to export them from the menu."
691779,mike rousseau,2012-05-01 02:45:00,4661, So once you export your data can you put in on the app so it looks the same as your unit in the boat...?  I'm gunna have to look into this... Cause I have a gold chip so I guess it's free If lota lota is saying what I think he is...
691782,BillM,2012-05-01 03:06:00,17367,"Mike, you gotta pay for the Navionics PC App unless you've just recently purchased a card.  I've got Hotmaps and Gold+ and I'm not eligible for a free download, lol."
691794,Stoty,2012-05-01 09:51:00,2910,"I believe to view your map chip on your PC you need the ""Nav Planner"" software and the navionics card reader. The maps wont work in a standard SD slot on a computer. Also, if you have the PC version as well as the mobile version, you can enable ""sync my data"". This mirrors all your routes/waypoints, etc on your PC and your phone, so when you add a new waypoint on either, it's automatically view-able on the other."
691818,mike rousseau,2012-05-01 12:19:00,4661,  Ah...  Ok then... No app for me...lol
691829,Stoty,2012-05-01 12:47:00,2910,"PC app is around the $30 I believe... which is a pretty darn good deal considering it has all of US/Canada on it, and the chips retail for about 6 times that and only cover 1/3 of the area..."
691834,BillM,2012-05-01 13:03:00,17367,"Stoty is right, PC App allows you to DL maps to view on your computer, NavPlanner is required to view your Navionics card on the computer..  I can easily transfer waypoints/routes from my spare SD card into MapSource or similar.  The 788ci will also import waypoints in GPX format as well.  HumminbirdPC is also another option for the guys with Humminbird units."
691838,mike rousseau,2012-05-01 13:10:00,4661,What kinda stuff can you do with this software...?  Other then look at maps on your PC...  Edit your waypoints?  Can you edit the map itself?Cause I know of some channels that aren't on navionics...or island names that are different and stuff...
691854,BillM,2012-05-01 13:39:00,17367,"Mike, you can't edit the maps but you could enter waypoints and transfer them over..   So if you found a channel, make a bunch of waypoints and drop it on a SD card and into the spare slot of your finder.  It will automatically upload the waypoints on the SD card during boot up."
691860,Dan668,2012-05-01 13:53:00,1120,Nice. So it looks like the pc app is better than the mobile version to view maps.
691896,OutdoorDan,2012-05-01 15:46:00,325,"OK, everything makes perfect sense now.  Thanks you so much, Bill."
692126,Stoty,2012-05-02 05:20:00,2910," No difference in the apps themselves, just viewing on a computer gives you a larger screen (I hope!) Which is exactly why I love my new iPad3! The best of both worlds!"
692221,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-02 16:39:00,10439,  Nope!!! Does not. It seems as though Navionics thinks the world ends at the 60th parallel. Unfortunately the only electronic mapping software available that covers my area is on CMap Cartridges. Maybe one day they will have my area on their software but I'm not holding my breath.
692330,Dan668,2012-05-02 21:17:00,1120," Nice, i think ill just download it for my tablet than. Dont ever use it really, this will put it to good use. And easier than printing maps."
692460,Stoty,2012-05-03 04:38:00,2910," Sorry... 99% of USA, and all of Canada, LOL"
