683486,ch312,2012-04-04 02:17:00,1590, i just got a homemade one with my boat that was built very well and works great. ill post some pics tomorrow.
683494,Sinker,2012-04-04 02:44:00,8692,"Have you looked into Line-X? Its crazy tough stuff. There is a shop in PTBO that could spray it on the areas you want for a decent price. They do a real neat job of it too. We have all our work truck beds sprayed with it, and its near bullet proof. The township salt trucks use it in the beds of the salt/sand trucks, so you know its gotta be tough stuff! You can get any colour you want too.  P.S..it won't be cheap, but it WILL last!  S."
683496,BillM,2012-04-04 03:00:00,17367,"Line-X would be a great choice, but I'd guess he'd be out somewhere close to $1500 or more to get that trailer done."
683498,Sinker,2012-04-04 03:02:00,8692,"We paid $800 for a full box and top rails of a 1/2 ton pick up last week, so I don't think the trailer would be that much. He would only need to do the front half as well, no?  It is good stuff though, you wouldn't have to worry about stone chips ever again, that is for sure!  S."
683501,BillM,2012-04-04 03:08:00,17367,"Yeah, it's bulletproof...  I didn't think about just doing the front half..  Probably better then spraying the entire thing anyhow."
683524,lew,2012-04-04 07:42:00,12766,Line-X is good stuff and I also have it in the bed of my truck.  I've seen full trailers done with it and it actually doesn't look too bad but I'm not sure if I'd want it myself but thanks for the suggestion.
683828,ch312,2012-04-05 03:20:00,1590,"as promised...  it sits perfectly level and touches the ground with weight on the ball. someone else built it, but that's my paint job    "
683829,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-05 03:31:00,10439, Forget any spray clear coat or the 3M clear adhesive film gravel will just blow it off like a sand blaster. The only thing I have seen that will withstand a good gravel road is truck bedliner (the liquid stuff). You can take your trailer into a place that does the spray on bedliners or do it yourself with the kit below. I know a thing or two about driving on dirt roads. You can also get tinted/colour matched bedliner.  Truck Bedliner
683841,Sinker,2012-04-05 04:35:00,8692,"I don't think any type of film is going to hold up to rock chips myself. You'll just end up having to take it off to repair the rust that will start underneath it. It may take a few years, but it will happen.  If your that worried about it, the Line X, or the tow tector idea is the best.  S."
693176,SlowPoke,2012-05-05 01:33:00,2984,"Just installed ""Rock Tamers"" from Cabela's. Nice product and currently on sale for $159    "
693184,Ainsley,2012-05-05 02:09:00,142,"The bed liner coating would probably be the most durable, just not sure how it would come out with the DIY kit, I think it's applied by roller. We use alot of marine/industrial paints where I work so my buddy just paints up our boat trailer with that."
693228,lew,2012-05-05 11:36:00,12766, Thanks for the heads-up Brian and on your recommendation I just ordered a set of the Rock Tamers from Cabelas. Their on back order but should be here in a couple weeks.
683211,lew,2012-04-03 12:34:00,12766,I live on a dirt road and even with mud flaps on my truck I still manage to get the odd stone chip on my boat trailer.  I was thinking of maybe spraying some type of clear coat on the vulnerable trailer surfaces but not sure if it'd work or not.  Anybody know of a product that may give some protection ??  I know about the shields that can be mounted in front of the rig but I'm not interested in those.
683220,Roy,2012-04-03 12:53:00,13728,"Lew, I think your best bet would be to get yourself some protective film. Apply it to the vulnerable areas. 3M makes some lines of it but several companies make or distribute the stuff. Google ""painted trailer protection"", the second and third results look interesting."
683221,I'mHooked,2012-04-03 12:57:00,525,"What about spray on gravel guard? It's the stuff that is often found on the rocker panels of cars etc. that has the orange peel type texture. It's basically a rubberized type spray on coating that is available in either black or clear. The clear would be an option if you dodn't want to have to paint over it. You can pick it up at Can. Tire, or any NAPA type store."
683223,COUNTRYBOY,2012-04-03 13:01:00,130,you could try spray on bedliner..you can buy a kit and do it yourself..rinocoat..tough stuff  
683231,krixxer,2012-04-03 13:23:00,274,it the trailer AL or FE ?
683234,doubleheader,2012-04-03 13:31:00,497,"Lew, you could add diamond plate to your fenders and axel housing, or as was mentioned the spray on bed liner. My trailer is black so I wire brush and spray paint the axel housing every year. You really can't see it too well with the boat loaded so my primary concern is to stop rust from getting a foothold. My fenders are a hard plastic and haven't chipped....yet."
683236,ohhenrygsr,2012-04-03 13:42:00,947,Rocker gaurd is a great way to protect the underside of the trailer.
683237,cuzza,2012-04-03 13:44:00,467,I'd go with the 3M film - it's tough stuff and easy to apply as long as the surface it's going onto is clean.
683242,COUNTRYBOY,2012-04-03 13:50:00,130," the 3m film is great but it has to be put on something just painted with no chips and rust. a friend of mine put it on the leading edges of his trailer and it still chipped a bit, i guess on dirt roads it's hard to avoid it. the rinocoat, i think is the best because the rocks just bounce off."
683246,Roy,2012-04-03 13:57:00,13728,"Lew's trailer is almost new. The bedliner, POR15 or whatever is probably the best protection for a trailer for which looks don't matter. It'd be a shame to hide a nice looking trailer under some kind of a truck undercoat. It'll depend on what he wants to achieve."
683248,COUNTRYBOY,2012-04-03 14:01:00,130,  well i guess that's the other side of the coin...look pretty or rust free
683258,Wolf 3,2012-04-03 14:25:00,134,"Lew,  Here is the website for the Vantage protection film. http://www.vantageresourcegroup.com/trailer-paint-protection.php  Some videos    "
683262,Roy,2012-04-03 14:32:00,13728," Yes, that's the stuff. Thanks."
683267,lew,2012-04-03 14:49:00,12766,"OK thanks guys, some really good suggetions there.  I looked into that clear plastic covering last year and was told by a local dealer that it would cost me about $300 for a bit to do my trailer.  Time to make some phone calls."
683268,Harrison,2012-04-03 14:51:00,2202,"Lew, just launch by the Nuke Plant. Haven't had trailer paint chip in years."
683285,captpierre,2012-04-03 16:22:00,2521,Good thread.  Was wondering what to do.  I've just been putting a dab of RustCheck on the chipped spots occasionally.  I spray all the areas on the trailer that are vulnerable twice/year.  Bolts/clamps etc.
683294,bigbuck,2012-04-03 17:08:00,2449,There is also a chip shield that you can attach to your trailer so the rocks don't beat up the pretty gel coat.
683311,whiskywizard,2012-04-03 17:51:00,305,"You can buy the 3M Scotchgard film on a roll and apply it yourself.  Here's one source   Bulk 3M Film  $8.75/ft on a roll that's 18"" wide. There's also a 24"" roll."
683313,Ron,2012-04-03 17:57:00,1683,"There is also an attachment that you can put on your trailer hitch itself. It is made of a bristle similar to that of a broom. I tried looking it up on the internet but no success. A buddy of mine has it on his truck to haul his Bass boat around. I am very impress on well it protects his boat. It stops the stones from becoming a problem in the first place. This goes on the hitch so if you are not towing, it will come off the same time you take the hitch out. My buddy leaves his on all year round, towing or not towing. I will get the name of it.  Cheers, Ron..."
683318,Wolf 3,2012-04-03 18:37:00,134, Towtector? http://www.towtector.com/
683321,Ron,2012-04-03 18:56:00,1683,"  Yes, that is very similar to what my buddy has. It does work very well to protect the boat and trailer."
683327,mike rousseau,2012-04-03 19:06:00,4661,i dont think the rhino lining looks that bad...  after all... it would just be the main frame of the trailer... not the fenders  and id would last a loooooong time.... probably expensive tho.... but if i had the money thats what id do...  but my trailer is galvanized...  so im good to go...   http://texastruxx.com/gi-58468-boat-trailer.html
683368,Spiel,2012-04-03 21:08:00,9065," Mine too, it ain't pretty per say but after years of painted trailers I opted to spend a little extra for it, no complaints as yet (6 years old). I know this is of little value to you now Lew but I had nothing else to offer."
683390,lew,2012-04-03 22:35:00,12766," This product looks like what I'm after and the price seems pretty good too, specially compared to what I was quoted last year for something similar.  I also like the Towtector and it's something I've considered.  Thanks again everyone."
683403,BillM,2012-04-03 23:04:00,17367,"I like the idea of the Towtector, but I doubt that mesh is going to stop a giant rock shot out from the rear tires..  I am going to make up something similar for the oldmans truck but will be using thick rubber instead.."
