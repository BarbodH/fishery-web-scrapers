Only three, but one around 13"" and one at 14"".....and a little guy. The crappy were 12' to 1' FOW.  Love watching a slip bobber dissappear...cool tool for fishing all species and much overlooked in my opinion.  Got Bass, Pike, perch and 2 OOS walleye also....good action for a short session.   Crappie for supper wasn't too shabby either.      <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/n48oSPV2Y9k"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                                  "

692438,Havtaflyfish,2012-05-03 02:50:00,7,Ya go ahead and rub it in. You were   and I was working !!! Nice sized crappie.
692507,johnnyb,2012-05-03 12:31:00,3413,That pike must have been a pretty good battle.....I'm assuming you were using fairly light tackle.  Nice job man!
692512,Harrison,2012-05-03 12:45:00,2202,"Man does that look good.  And crappie action shots too!!  Limey, try a small clear float, drennen or one of the like.  They can sometimes be float shy up that shallow and in gin water.  If you slip it, just use a piece of rubber spinnerbait skirt and tie a knot so it slips through the bottom eye of the float.  You may be suprised.  Good luck!"

I wouldn't....lol....Drennan Pikers (6gm) is what i usually use, stepped on my last one last fall shore fishing.....have been a fan of those for over 10 years now....got into them in England for sea fishing mackerel....awesome all round float. Even better than spinner bait skirt are the bobber stops i use....Drennan also have their own version too   Thanks Brian...the salad was awesome...amazing what you can find in my fridge....lol. Added the strawberries cuz they were on their way out...really worked well with the salty capers and olives....YUM!"
