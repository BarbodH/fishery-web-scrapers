693103,BillM,2012-05-04 22:28:00,17367,"Simcoe just doesn't seem like your typical muskie lake..  I hope they do catch on, but it's going to be an uphill battle."
693115,davey buoy,2012-05-04 23:05:00,5505,"There were a couple guy at one of the ramps in cooks bay last summer :whistling:Said they saw a fellow with a 50"" plus muskie. Heard from a couple others into the fall as well. I would think that all the lakes to the north and south are joined by the trent/severn system,what would stop muskies from entering Simcoe if need be?"
693127,I'mHooked,2012-05-04 23:31:00,525,Hey great job Dax! Thanks for taking the time to help do some good for the fishery! Efforts are appreciated.
693128,kickingfrog,2012-05-04 23:35:00,8333, Low numbers because they are top-o-the food chain and they are not really known for making long migrations.
693131,Pigeontroller,2012-05-04 23:38:00,2793," I understand Ron, time to burn the candle at both ends in another worthy cause..."
693132,Pigeontroller,2012-05-04 23:40:00,2793," Muskie are native to Simcoe, like the 'other' great Lakes, thats why its called a RESTORATION project, not an Introduction..."
693133,Pigeontroller,2012-05-04 23:41:00,2793," I am not privy to all the details, but habitat restoration has/is been part of the LSMRP."
693179,Garfisher,2012-05-05 01:42:00,229,"I'm pretty sure the habitat is already in Simcoe, the fish were basically wiped out from Commercial fishing (and apparently there was a stocking program in the 70's that helped with the decline due to using Kawartha-strain Muskies instead of the Great Lakes-strain Muskies [which is why the fish are being trapnetted from ""close to Georgian Bay"" ]). Dax, I'm pretty sure those eggs today were intended for somewhere else, we didn't get them (I'm the summer employee in the hatchery)."
693180,Pigeontroller,2012-05-05 01:53:00,2793,"There were two jars of fertilized eggs collected...One was for Flemming, the other was for another hatchery but nobody wanted to make a drive to get them..."
693181,Garfisher,2012-05-05 01:55:00,229,"Right Emily mentioned something about that. Hopefully we can get another family or two next week, the eggs we received yesterday are doing pretty well"
692788,Pigeontroller,2012-05-04 00:42:00,2793,"Today I had the pleasure of volunteering to help two dedicated OMNR biologists check the trap nets set near Georgian Bay. The purpose of which was to collect eggs and milt from two ripe Muskies so the fertized eggs could be taken to the fish hatchery at Flemming College in Lindsay, and eventually the resulting fingerlings will be released into Lake Simcoe in the fall. We checked several trap nets, counted and released many nice Bass(some near 6 lbs.), a few Pike, a monster Crappie, Carp, lots of Bluegills and Bullheads, and many Northern Map Turtles, two of which were dinner plate sized! After checking 4 nets and finding no Muskies we lucked out and the 5th net had two males and a BIG female. We were able to collect the first 'family' of 2012 for the Lake Simcoe Muskellunge Restoration Project. Here's Ian Young (MCI President) and I as we released the 52"", 37 lb. female!  "
692789,BillM,2012-05-04 00:45:00,17367,"Sweet!!!!  I did the exact same thing out on Gloucestor Pool/Little Lake with the MNR back a few years ago..  We also got some monster crappies in the nets, lol!"
692791,Christopheraaron,2012-05-04 00:46:00,3525,"Good idea on the warning, but I don't think anyone could be angry at the project!"
692792,irishfield,2012-05-04 00:48:00,26272,Great stuff Dax! Just proves there's no harm in a quick picture...
692793,kickingfrog,2012-05-04 00:48:00,8333,"Nice work. Thanks.  I used to pull the nets as well, just indexing not for breeding. Always killed me to see some monster fish that I rarely was able to find once the seasons opened."
692795,Gregoire,2012-05-04 00:50:00,1397,"I'm still not sold on the viability of the Simcoe musky restoration, but I am happy to see a pic of such a hog. Maybe with genetics like that swimming around Simcoe the musky fishery will recover, maybe even in my lifetime."
692808,mistaredone,2012-05-04 01:15:00,913,Nice!!
692811,NAW,2012-05-04 01:31:00,4022,"That""s awesome.  I didn't know one could volunteer to do something like that.  Very cool to see the mother of a fish I might catch on Simcoe one day!!!"
692812,kickingfrog,2012-05-04 01:34:00,8333,I used to get paid to do it. Then they realised you guys would do it for free and that was that.
692816,Pigeontroller,2012-05-04 01:42:00,2793, I'm pretty sure Emily and Brent were paid for their efforts today...Alot of fishery work in Ontario just wouldn't get done if not for volunteers...
692850,WeedLine,2012-05-04 03:39:00,322,Great work! That's a sweet muskie. I would love to see those in Simcoe one day
692881,solopaddler,2012-05-04 11:31:00,8605,Hey now that's pretty cool! Would be nice to see a viable fishery on Simcoe.
692884,Pigeontroller,2012-05-04 11:34:00,2793,"Here's some more for you to enjoy...sinker  3 fish, two more than allowed by posession limit...    Fertilized eggs, headed to Sir Sandford Flemming College...    "
692885,solopaddler,2012-05-04 11:36:00,8605,Those eggs look like they'd tie up nicely in chartreuse for steelhead.   Hmmmm..........     
692890,F7Firecat,2012-05-04 11:50:00,347,very cool Dax!  yes i do know your name LOL
692891,Steve,2012-05-04 11:50:00,2075," Solo, what goes for one should be allowed to go for all.   I'd say start tying."
692894,mercman,2012-05-04 11:55:00,7054,"Awesome,interesting day you must have had Dax, and you can now say, you had a whole handfull of Musky !!!"
692909,Grimace,2012-05-04 12:28:00,2020,"Very cool.   I am assuming you were volunteering as representative of Muskies Canada.  If so, that is a great example of how your organization works with the MNR and can help out.   Super cool.   I hope the Lake Simcoe Musky project is a success.  I don't fish Musky but it would still be nice to see.  Cheers."
693001,Lip-ripper,2012-05-04 16:18:00,228,"Nice Muskie. He's holding it wrong though, too much arch in it's back."
693016,Roy,2012-05-04 17:18:00,13728,"Good stuff Dax. I took out most of the irrelevant stuff as it was just making a good thread bad. To the others who have a problem with how this board is run, PM or email one of the mods. Putting it on here is just tacky and serves no purpose. Thanks for understanding."
693057,Fisherman,2012-05-04 19:39:00,7201," Ah no, thanks to you for clearing the rubbish away."
693062,Ron,2012-05-04 19:47:00,1683,"Nice to see you contributing to the worthy cause Dax. I have a lot of belief and faith in the LSMRP. This is one of the few things I miss cancelling my membership to MCI. Will this put you into the 50 inch club now?  Cheers, Ron..."
693068,Fishing yoda,2012-05-04 19:57:00,29,fantastic! another restoration project for ontario to have under its belt!!!
693074,capt bruce,2012-05-04 20:16:00,820,"Great work , Im still not sure the money is well spent in this project , without habitant rehab ??? , but I am so happy to see you guys are useing some great genes , hope the babies of this mother can go on to grow to the same sizes or even bigger in simcoe ... Keep up the good work , its guys like you giveing up their time so guys like me can enjoy ... OH and solo I dont know about tieing them up for steel, but spread on a cracker with some warm brie and a  Snifter  of some good Cognac yum yum .. lol"
693100,Carp,2012-05-04 22:18:00,1488,"Sweet fish.  I think the muskie will be fine in Lake Simcoe. The only issue may be with competition from pike on the spawning areas, but they co-exist with pike on many other lakes. I'd love to see some hugo skis start coming out of Simcoe."
