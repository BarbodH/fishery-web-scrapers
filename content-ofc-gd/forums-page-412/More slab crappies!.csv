I didnt need much time to make the decision, though I was a little hesitant with the strong east winds pushing in.  We got out around 8:30 and the wind was already bucking out there, but we ran to saturday's location.  After 30 minutes and 6 pike, we realized we needed to do some looking.  the water was 4 degrees warmer than Saturday, so I figured they would be heading towards typical spawning locations.  We made a move and it didnt take long before we were into them.  We didnt get nearly the numbers that we did before, but there were some slabs around and we put about 40 fish in the boat over the next few hours.  No complaints here!  As usual, X-Zone Pan Slammers did the trick, and we got a couple bigger fish on the Shiver Shads as well.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JOzufNCgYU&feature=g-upl"
