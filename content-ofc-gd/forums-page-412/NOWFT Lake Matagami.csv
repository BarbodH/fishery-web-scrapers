692609,KShea,2012-05-03 16:23:00,18,Was wondering if anyone was fishing the Matagami walleye tourney the first weekend in June and needed another in their boat. My cousin has a cottage on the lake and has fished the tourney the last few years and I've been trying to get out to it but no luck yet. My boat isn't quite big enough. Not the best walleye guy but im a decent enough fisherman and can pick up pretty quick.
