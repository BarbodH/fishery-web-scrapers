I read that the spools on each are interchangable, so if you need added line capacity you can throw on a 3000 spool or vice versa. Is this the only difference? If so, why is the 3000 about $40 more??  pairing the reel up with a 7'2"" Xfast Cumara for drop shotting and bottom bouncing.  Can't figure out which model to go with! Any input is appreciated  "

692663,Whitemikeca,2012-05-03 18:27:00,138,"Adam, diff should just be capacity and a little weight.  2500 is more than enough capacity for drop shot.  I say the 2500"
692669,KShea,2012-05-03 18:38:00,18,"Have you tried one out?? I was going to get one but couldn't get past the round hand grip instead of the usual paddle, ended up with a pfleuger patriarch which is sweet. I did notice the grip on the 3000 is a lot bigger than on the 2500 its a big nobby thing, but i don't see that being a 40$ diff."
692676,Gregoire,2012-05-03 18:57:00,1397,"If the spool is interchangeable and you want the 3000 I would purchase the 2500 and buy a 3000 spool as these reels do not come with a spare spool. You could spool the 2500 spool with braid and the 3000 with fluoro. Use the braid in tinted water with a leader, and use the fluoro in clear water. I was never a huge believer in line transparency and the effect on fishing, but I fish Simcoe a few times a year, and have always used braided mainline. This year I am going to try running full fluoro line and see if it makes a difference. Never had any luck on Simcoe if you are wondering why I am looking to switch."
692679,addy79,2012-05-03 19:08:00,573,"thanks guys,  I'm thinking along the same lines...  having interchangeable spools is a nice bonus; gonna probably stick with the 2500 and buy an extra 3000 spool for a little variety.  on a side note; anyone try the Suffix fluoro?"
