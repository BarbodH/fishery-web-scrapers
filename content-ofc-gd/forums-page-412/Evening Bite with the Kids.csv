692832,The Urban Fisherman,2012-05-04 03:06:00,2050,"It was such an awesome day today that I decided we had no choice but hammer back supper and run down to the lake for the evening bite before bed!     We tried the trout thing for a few minutes but the kids weren't patient enough so off we went in search of panfish!  We caught a whole slew of fish and the kids had a great evening out on the lake... we made it home 1hr and 15 minutes past bedtime... oops  ... the kids got off easy but me not so much haha ah well... it was worth it!  Averie was first to put a fish on the board   Luke followed up with a little rockie... he's just now starting to hold fish!       Averie's got the rockbass hold down pat     Personal best largie doesn't count because it's Out of season... she's 5 and wanted a pic so close your eyes if you don't want to see it   Fearless and focused lol   I lost a personal best perch boatside and the kids caught a bunch of decent ones as well     The kids didn't think I'd jump in so I had to prove them wrong... water was in the low 50's talk about refreshing     Anyways - we had a great few hours on the lake.  Looking forward to doing it with them again soon!  Cheers, Ryan, Averie and Luke"
692835,l2p,2012-05-04 03:12:00,346,Awesome!
692836,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-04 03:13:00,2690,"Great stuff buddy!!! That's two PB perch lost there in two nights. Hope you didn't get in too much trouble, you are turning Averie and Luke into awesome little fisherpeople"
692841,The Urban Fisherman,2012-05-04 03:21:00,2050," Thanks dude!   Here's the kicker Frank - It was a male perch and he was ""peeing"" all over...I thought I had him pinned real well so I put him over the side of the boat for a second and he came unbuttoned..."
692852,fishnsled,2012-05-04 03:46:00,3520," If I recall correctly, you did the same thing on the weekend while trying to take a picture.  Awesome report Ryan, everyone looked like they had a great time even if you were a bit late getting the kids home. Look on the bright side, you've got lots of company in the dog house."
692870,ccmtcanada,2012-05-04 10:53:00,7971,Excellent report Ryan!  Being a bit late...who cares! Lol.  You are creating awesome memories for them.  Congrats on all the PB's...even the ones lost boatside
692875,mercman,2012-05-04 10:57:00,7054,Awesome!!! Put a smile on my face for the rest of the day.  Thanks Ryan.   Paul
692879,bigugli,2012-05-04 11:22:00,6138,"Ryan, rules were sometimes meant to be broken.  Keeping the kids out late, or pulling them from school was a regular thing in our home. If it means you and your kids are having fun together, and getting in some precious bonding time time....  WHO CARES WHAT THE RULES ARE. Enjoy every precious minute of it."
692883,solopaddler,2012-05-04 11:34:00,8605,Perfect little outing Ryan. Can someone say shrinkage?
692886,lovetofish,2012-05-04 11:38:00,500,"Great job on getting the kids out fishing!  Wish I would have known my 2 step daughters when they were younger.  I ask them to go fishing now and I just get that look, why would I want to do that.  Jumping in the water to prove the kids wrong sounds like something I would do.  Thanks for sharing.   LTF"
692893,Nipfisher,2012-05-04 11:53:00,2449,"Great report Ryan. Kids are really holding their own in the boat now. You're crazy for swimming this early. LOL. May long weekend is earliest I've ever ""intentionally"" went in the drink."
692901,limeyangler,2012-05-04 12:14:00,5204,Ryan....dont you dare do that again!  I was scrolling through the pics just fine then this glowing white demon ghost with a wild eyed stare scared the bjayzus outta me!!!!   ABSOLUTELY MY FAVORITE POST EVER! (so good I even spelt 'favourite' the North American way!)   What a team! How old is Luke? 3? Jack wont go near a fish....lol. Maybe dad needs to catch more when he's out.  Absolutely loving the pic of Avery up by the trolling motor.....Luke has a fantastic tutor right there.  WAY TO GO DAD....AWESOMENESS!
692925,SirCranksalot,2012-05-04 13:10:00,3291,"priceless pix! esp the first. I couldn't get my kids interested either. Like was said above, I need to catch more!"
692936,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-04 13:34:00,2690,"  Now that's funny stuff!!!!  For those that don't know, Ryan's dog had puppies last weekend"
692937,wildeye rainbow,2012-05-04 13:37:00,123,Nice report.  Spending quality time with your kids is something that they will always remember.  I used to take my kids canoeing/fishing there - it's a real gem.
692942,NAW,2012-05-04 13:51:00,4022,Great report man!
693027,fishinmortician,2012-05-04 18:27:00,100,  Great pics! I have a 2 year old and one being born this week (BOTH GIRLS IM DOOMED) and I can't wait to take the kids out and enjoy!!
693106,Carp,2012-05-04 22:30:00,1488,"Always great to get the kids out fishing.  Cold water = perky pinks on the upper and ""turtle like"" symptoms below."
693114,Christopheraaron,2012-05-04 23:02:00,3525,"Can't hide anything from me, after a while of looking around I found your secret spot to the metre! Good fishing!  PS is the lake public?"
