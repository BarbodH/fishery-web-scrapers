They all dried up and the action is not apparent. I use jackal crosstail shads most of the time but figured I'd switch it up. I want to buy six packs. What combinations of colors/sizes would you recommend for bass and the odd walleye?  Thanks, daniel"
692962,johnnyb,2012-05-04 14:29:00,3413,I've seen the most success for bass and eyes on the smoke/purple flake.  I'm surprised the ones you have dried up though...I just keep them in a big ziploc and they do great.  I like that the colours don't bleed either....I keep a mixed bag with a little bit of everything in it and they all retain their colours
