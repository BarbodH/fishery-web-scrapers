I would like to limit the drive to about 12 hours max from toronto. She loves to fish. Well she loves to catch. So I am hoping with the use of a guided service I can get her hooked on spec's. I was thinking of doing lac beauchinen kirkland lake are, or ...???  Anyone have any recs? and BTW if you want to keep any of the info you can pass on to me on the down low, I will honour your request to keep any info private that you PM me private. I will post pictures though, but no locations.  Thanks in advance... Price isn't a huge concern but I would like to keep it reasonable. So chartering a flight or something like that is out of my wallets reach."

Killarney is also a great too!!  just a few suggestions for ya."
693044,BillM,2012-05-04 19:22:00,17367,Some great fly-in brookie lakes out of Hawk Junction...  You definitely wouldn't need a guide for any of them...
