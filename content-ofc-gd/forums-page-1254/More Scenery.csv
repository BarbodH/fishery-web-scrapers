45350,Hooked,2007-03-10 05:26:00,891,"Amazing pics Northhunter!  Very crisp picture too.  They are all amazing, but I have to say, the pic of the forest with all the moss and the island pic have to be my favourites.  Nice job!  Would love to see more."
45373,OhioFisherman,2007-03-10 11:58:00,6623,Great pictures! I miss seeing the rocky shorelines!
45389,solopaddler,2007-03-10 13:24:00,8605,"Fabulous stuff Northunter! I agree, the picture with the moss is very cool. There's a portage on the Lookout River n/w of Armstrong called ""fantasia"" portage....very cool, it looks strikingly similar to your picture."
45391,Bly,2007-03-10 13:32:00,1556,"Stunning!  I haven't seen much of Canada but through pictures like yours and other members, I often feel like I have taken a little tour of all the beautiful places this country has to offer.  Thank you for sharing these, mind if I save a few to my computer?  bly"
45434,douG,2007-03-10 17:01:00,2693,"Where is that place, NorthHunter?  Makes me itch for Opeongo and Algonquin park."
45444,lew,2007-03-10 17:57:00,12767,"Beautiful pictures Northhunter, infact, it's hard tp pick out the best !!"
45478,mattyk,2007-03-10 21:03:00,2110,the pics help the day dreaming.
45482,Larry,2007-03-10 21:43:00,32,Very nice pics. The Moss in the bush is excellent.  Larry
45490,pameladallaire,2007-03-10 22:08:00,470,"Aaaah, the moss one is begging to be painted.  Pam"
45492,Clausewitz,2007-03-10 22:21:00,19,"Great pics, thanks, helps while the winter blues are still around."
45504,Northhunter,2007-03-10 23:08:00,214,"Thanks for the comments! I usually take more than one of the same shot, and pick out the best. The ""moss"" pic was an exception. We were tracking a bear up near Red Lake and I had to stop and take out the camera for a quick pic. The ""island"" and ""dock"" shots are from the same trip.  The rest are mostly from Nipissing.  Bly - go ahead. I have full-size versions if you'd prefer.  I have others, but a lot of them are from film and would need to be scanned."
45589,lunkerbasshunter,2007-03-11 03:35:00,2585,that moss pic is sweet!  cheers
