We also want to be sure you read the rules so you don't drive your captain nuts. Sign up by posting to the official sign up thread...  Click here"

The first would be for inland lakes and the second one for BIG LAKES.  I can't compete against the BOQ guys like Cliff (LOL) No chance there!"

If the captains want a great lakes/non great lakes separation of walleye, it is something they can vote on. But I think you will find the difference in walleye from the Great Lakes to be primarily in girth, not so much in length due to the food available."
