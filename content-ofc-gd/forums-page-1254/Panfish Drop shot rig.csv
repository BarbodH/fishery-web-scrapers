I tried to search the forums for some info and I didn't really find any.  Does anyone know how to set it up?  What do I need? What works best for you?  Thanks in advance!  "

46001,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-03-12 14:35:00,135,Can you be more specific?  What's the weight of the sinker?  Size/type of hook?  Do you have any pics of this set-up?  Thanks!

46006,BabyHerc,2007-03-12 14:40:00,285,"I've been making panfish ""drop-shot"" rigs before drop-shotting came to North America.  I tie them two ways: one, just like a regular drop-shot with a palomar knot to a size 6 or 8 aberdeen hook, or a similar sized octopus hook.  I then nose hook either a tube jig, plastic minnow, live minnow, or leech.  The second way is to either use a regular sinker or tie a 1/8 oz marabou jig to the bottom, and tie one or two dropper loops up the line.  Attached to each mainline is a either a tube jig or bare aberdeen hook.  The marabou version works very well under a float as well."
