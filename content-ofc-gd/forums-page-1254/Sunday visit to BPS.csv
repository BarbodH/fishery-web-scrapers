Last week I realized, at the age of 37, I have yet to ever by myself a rod or reel. All my previous gear were Christmas or Birthday gifts.  After some great feedback on trolling equipment on a previous thread, I opted for the Shimano TDR. I wanted an 8'6"" MH action but they had none so settled for an 8 footer.  I also bought a Daiwa Sealine 49LCA and it matches up great with the rod. Can't wait to try them. It was nice to spend a little money on myself for a change.  Picked up a can of Uncle Buck's mix. Love Fish Crisp but it will be nice to try something a little different.  Got a couple of deals on some body baits as well.  I lucked out as my timing coincided with a seminar by Dave Mercer. Had some very good tips that can be used regardless of where you fish and what your fishing for. Gear recommendations, techniques etc."

When I'm making a batch of fish, I'll mix some BPS stuff, Fish Crisp (usually cajun), and some bread crumbs.    .  Jim"

So how about we just skip the formality of shopping - you just take my wallet and I'll meet you at the checkout' .  That store is just evil to impulse buyers like me.  I picked up a can of that Uncle Buck's mix as well this weekend (sucker for a display).  Let me tell you - the hot and spicy really is pretty damn spicy.  I think I was trying it out on the perch I caught Sunday night but damned if I could taste anything besides the mix (may have layed it on a bit thick I suppose)."
46103,bucktail,2007-03-12 18:38:00,1857,I was a bad boy and picked up a Curado and a Symetry as well as a new tackle bag and a bunch of soft and hard baits. The one thing I am looking forward to trying is a lucky strike cranckbait that was 40% off. I just can't make myself spend 25 dollars on a crankbait.
