45577,glen,2007-03-11 03:18:00,2641,Went out by long shoal today.  The slush was bad when we broke though the top we would go right to the ice surface and have to push the atv to get out.  travel time was about an hour on the atv before we had holes drilled.    There was two of us on one atv with no sled.  I saw some people stuck real bad.  I got a nice laker and buddy got the whitefish.  Didn't take the camera out with us so i took a pic on shore for you.  I didn't ask my friend if it was ok to post the pic so i blocked out his face.

45584,glen,2007-03-11 03:26:00,2641,About 85ft.  I don't know why the pic is a thumbnail.  Maybe someone can fix it.  I am going to bed.
