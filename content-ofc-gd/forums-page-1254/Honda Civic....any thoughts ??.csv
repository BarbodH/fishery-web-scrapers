45170,bigbuck,2007-03-09 22:18:00,2449,"Lew, tell her to go for it. We got rid of our '03 Element with 65000k's on it with NO PROBLEMS whatsoever. It was a great vehicle and I had two beefs with it, it needed a bigger gas tank (55L) and some more power (156hp). Going up the hills north of the Sault fully loaded were no fun but other than those 2 minor beefs, it was awesome. Like you, I'm a die hard GM kinda guy with 2 Oldsmobiles on the driveway now (the Element was sold to make way for a minivan). I'm just not a 4banger guy, I need at least 6 cylinders and preferably a V8 under the hood (my car has an 8). I'm no speed demon but when I have to  pass someone, it's nice to know that the power is on tap."
45193,lookinforwalleye,2007-03-09 23:06:00,4399,"Some one mention domestic cars and the lousy re sale value no argument here but I say use that to your advantage, a low mileage 06 Civic will cost 18-20 grand a low mileage 06 Chevy Cobalt or similar car will cost 12 grand I say take the domestic and she can pocket the 8 grand and put it towards a nice fathers day gift for her great dad.  p.s. Last night I bought a used low mileage 06 Buick Allure to replace my Maxima looked at the 06 Accord and Camry`s as well but at 26 grand i went for the 16 grand Buick to me it was a no brainer the Buick was  much smoother and much more comfortable driving car than the imports."
45210,lew,2007-03-09 23:44:00,12767, I like the way you think lookinforwalleye
45377,ecmilley,2007-03-10 12:39:00,2163,"Lew if your daughter is buyiing used and you want a second opinion on the car she picks your more than welcome to bring it over, we'll throw it up on a hoist and go over it with a fine tooth comb"
45379,lew,2007-03-10 12:43:00,12767,"Thanks Ernie, very generous of you, but she'll be getting a new one.  I do appreciate your offer though."
45387,solopaddler,2007-03-10 13:21:00,8605,"Have to concur with most here Lew, the Civic is a fantastic car. Only other thing I'd mention, if resale isn't a factor, that is if Sheri plans to drive the car for a long time, then I'd look at a comparable Hyundai. IMO, you're getting Honda quality with an even better warranty for less money. Only negative is the resale value can't hold a candle to Honda's...."
45687,Tybo,2007-03-11 13:26:00,1373,"Lew, before you make your minds up on the civic. Take a look at Saturn. They are one of the best commuter car out there, and very affordable with great gas mileage."
45000,lew,2007-03-09 14:10:00,12767,"Yup, the Civic is for my daughter, but that's not to say I won't borrow it the odd time when I'm feeling ""sporty""  And as Mike the Pike says, as for her needing a car to race others away from traffic lights, that was never her style, she's looking for good reliable transportation, that's cheap to operate, but will give her good consistent performance and not need to be in the shop every 2nd week.  As for General Motors, I'm a big fan myself and I've owned General Motors vehicles nearly exclusively for 40 years and have NEVER had a bad one.  I've owned everything from Corvairs to Rivieras, some used, but many new ones, and have never had a lemon, nor have I ever had to pay out any large sums of money for repairs.  I'm currentely driving a 2005 Safari and luv it, and it's my 2nd new Safari in just a few years.  As for the Honda, I think it'll be an excellent car for my daughter and I certainly appreciate all the feedback from everyone.  Thanks boyz & girlz"
45006,Cookslav,2007-03-09 14:16:00,1457,"Well, Not to burst the bubble, but if we're giving first had expereince stories...  2 freinds of mine had  2001 + model Civics. One retunred it at the end of his lease due to electiral issues, and a bad transmition. The other sold it, after haveing...you guessed it Electircal Issues, and having the Tranny done.  Both guys were commuters...K-town to Toronto. Not sure if they both got lemons or what?  For the record though....one of the two owned a 90's model Before buying his last one. (1990 I think?) That older one lasted him till he bought new, and he had no major issues to speak of. (He got rid of it because the Body Rusted out.)  I'm a GM guy myself but ""if"" I was going to choose an import....it would be a Civic or a Corolla"
45009,wuchikubo,2007-03-09 14:18:00,1114,"Hi Lew,  I've got no concerns over the engine and fuel efficiency for the small car but the fact that I lost two friends as passengers in Hondas will always be on my mind when considering Hondas. I've been to Japan, (my wife is Japanese), the average speed limit in most cases is 40-50 Km/hr thus the reasoning I think they don't worry as much about the crash ratings in Jp. It's not the same here where everyone is pushing 120 km on the highways. Toyotas have been more conservative with their engine / fuel technology but have been more likely to put money towords safety as opposed to Honda.  I guess when I was going up, everyone was raving about how fast the civic would go but none ever spoke about how they might have saved their lives (I remembered more injured and dead from their accidents). IMPO Toyota and the newer GM would be my considerations.  Stan"
45013,ccmtcanada,2007-03-09 14:28:00,7971,"I've had lots of friends with Hondas and with regular maintenance they'll run forever!  As mentioned everywhere else, they are a top rated car.  I have a Honda CRV (1998) with well over 250,000kms on it and it's been awesome.  The salesman said that the engine in it is basically the civic engine.  We've had to replace belts and of course regular oil changes, but it's been very reliable.  I went in to have my brakes looked at at around 130,000 kms....not because I was having problems, but because of the mileage.  The guy said that they were fine....85% front, 90% rear.  Now that I think of it, I haven't replaced ANY of the exhaust system either...original pipes and muffler on that thing."
45027,jughead,2007-03-09 14:58:00,92,"My sister in law has been driving her honda daily since 1991 and outside of routine maintanence has never had an issue. I had a 1989 Tercel that I drove until 2000 and sold to a friend who is still driving it. It has over 500,000 K on it and again, just routine maintainence. I have owned 2 fords - an expedition and a leased Focus for work. Both were bad on gas and rife with problems. The Focus had 16 recalls in 13 months, some quite major. I would never go near a Ford again, especially a new line.  I now have a 2003 Corolla. Runs like a charm, never a problem and it gets great mileage. I commute from Ottawa to Toronto about twice a month and it takes just over 3/4 of a tank.  For value, resale, fuel economy, etc. go with a Honda or a toyota. Both great cars so pick whicever one has the style you like."
45037,Golfisher,2007-03-09 15:19:00,586,"This might interest those concerned about safety issues.    The article itself, as well as the full study, can be found here:  Berkeley Lab Report  You are almost twice more likely to die in a Cavalier and Escort than in a Civic or Corolla.  In fact, Civic's fatality rate is actually lower than most SUVs and trucks.  I have to admit that I was a bit surprised to find this out myself.  I guess bigger doesn't necessary mean safer."
45054,ecmilley,2007-03-09 16:05:00,2163,"well Lew I'll chime in on this, as the japanese have increased hp in many of there engine's they have run into the same problem as the big 3 these last couple of years and thats transmission issues, odd electrical issues but all cars on the road built the last 4-5 years are extremley reliable compared to even 1990, the only real issues i have seen with Honda the last couple years is power window's acting up (no one builds trouble free windows anyway) daytime running light issues (90% time burned bulb) the odd one with oil consumption issues, nissan, toyota and honda have seem to developed a problem with brake longevity as well, changing out alot of pads now ar 30-40k when the older versions were 70-90k . The only thing you may want to look into is insurance rates for vehicles they can vary widly from model to model.  the civic was in the top 5 for stolen cars."

45120,fishinfool,2007-03-09 20:03:00,366,"Lew I bought the wife a brand new 05 Civic and was a little ticked that Honda failed to tell me at the time that the new body style was coming in 06. Anyway we love the civic, it's a great little car for getting around town. I looked at the Mazda 3, Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic at the time and was told the Honda had the best resale value for the longest time, that's why I ended up going for the Honda. You can't go wrong with Honda. Your daughter will love it.  Stan"
44741,lew,2007-03-08 22:55:00,12767,"Since my daughter was forced off the road and her car totalled a couple weeks back, she's now ready to purchase a new vehicle and is interested in a new 2007 Honda Civic.  She's like me and has always driven GM but is now ready to try something new.  I've heard their sposed to be an excellent vehicle but was wondering if any of you folks have any 1st hand experience with them ??  Any thoughts ??  "

I think we got a good deal on the car.... we have had Zero issues with it and it is a daily driver. I too see ALOT of older model Hondas on the road... sure their may be a few rust spots on em... but the engines are in perfect working order....   Should you require a hand in choosing a dealer and dont mind dealing with a place in Hamilton to purchase the car, I have a name for you. PS... any Honda dealership will service it....   Gerritt."
44745,trapshooter,2007-03-08 23:13:00,1234,"Hey Lew,  My fiance and I have a 95 civic right now and it runs great, mind you it does have low kms still.   Honda makes an excellent engine, IMO.  I did have a friend who had a new one and put a ton of kms on it doing a sales job and the suspension fell apart pretty bad.  He was hard on it though.  If your daughter puts a lot of kms on her car, check out the diesel VW Golf or jetta.  I had a 2002 golf and loved that car."
44746,Bernie,2007-03-08 23:13:00,3190,"Hello Lew. Great car. Great company. All my customers that own them-love them. They are well put together. Several of my customers have over 400,000km with normal maintainence."
44748,PERCHER,2007-03-08 23:18:00,787,Lew before you buy a Honda go to your local Ford dealer and test drive the new Ford Fusion.I bet you will be glad you did.Dan
44752,Bernie,2007-03-08 23:24:00,3190,Going by past experience on first year model cars history.......avoid the Fusion like the plague!!!! Seen somewhere in my autoline discussion where the Fusion air filter is $150 bucks(US$) It may end up being a decent car in the future.... but...do you want to chance it?
44753,lew,2007-03-08 23:31:00,12767,"Thanks boyz, it's good to hear all the positive feedback on the Civic.  They've been around alot of years and I don't recall ever hearing anything bad about them and I'll pass all your thoughts onto Sheri."
44756,PERCHER,2007-03-08 23:34:00,787,"The Fusion came out in 2006 and uses 2 differnt engines that have been tried and proven.The air filter for 150.00 only has to be changed every 160,000km.If you price out how many air filters you would change in a Honda in that many km's you will find the Ford will be almost half the price."
44757,Bernie,2007-03-08 23:35:00,3190,The Toyota line is also an option Lew. Maybe she can use that knowledge to edge a better deal on the Honda.

44761,Gerritt,2007-03-08 23:41:00,6129,  Good point... Honda has a fantastic resale value.. especially to 18 year old punks that put them loud resonators on em LOL   Gerritt.

44782,Garyv,2007-03-09 00:18:00,547,"The only problem I know of anyone having with a Civic was transmission related at over 350000K and with 3 young adults under 19 driving it.  I don't know of anyone that isn't satisfied with their Honda or Toyota.  Heck my daughter and son in law have an Accord and Odyssey, my neighbor a Odyssey, Civic and an Element  and they have all been trouble free.  My Son bought his wife a Toyota corolla, and a good friend and his wife have a Camary and a Tundra, in fact they have had Toyotas for over 20 years and will not buy another brand.

Honda builds a solid engine that will outlast any GM IMO  We are planning on gettigna new car in a few months, its most likely gonna be a Civc. The Yaris and the Golf are the next choices, but I hear VW parts can be costly."

44855,Mike the Pike,2007-03-09 02:35:00,3421,"Well Lew Honda civic gets my vote over Toyota eventhough they are both good.The Civic is  sleaker hands down better looking than the Corolla.When buying a small 4 cylinder car japanese are second to none.The Ford Fusion I am sure is a nice riding car but we are not comparing apples to apples.The Fusion is a Mid size sedan and it will not achieve the fuel economy of the Honda.The Ford is in another class midsize.  When I became a sales rep in 2000 I sold my 1989 Honda civic to a lady at the time it had 253 000kms on it.That same car is still on the road today with over 350 000kms on it.I drove the crap out of that little Civic and it just came back for more.  My current Van is a Honda Odessey 2000 no complaints.I had to change the front shocks only because Quebec roads are the worst in Canada.Just replaced the battery and I had to replace the timing belt at 100 000kms just regular maintenance.It pulls my 2600 pound tent trailer with ease.  My boat motor is a 50hp Honda runs like a dream.I had a 24 year old Honda 7.5hp when I sold it ,it ran like brand new.  One more thing the new civic has a very high safety rating!  Honda is the largest manufacturer of engines in the world.  Get the civic.  As for Ford I would buy an F-150 but the Honda Ridgeline is lost in the pickup world.  MTP"
