Cant boot windows past MUP.SYS .. tried Everything .. anyhow after re-installing everything  (that I could find) she still doesnt have any of her 'personal' stuff... I cant fgure out where all her files went to  ... and I'll never get my Saturday night/Sunday back ... but what the heck ... it got me through anther smoke free day ... heh if I can manage that stress I I am on the road to recovery   Heh 'Life's Good' is the brand .... and I gues in a silly just shoot me kinda way ... I suppose it is
