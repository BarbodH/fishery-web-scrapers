45656,motv8tr,2007-03-11 12:14:00,2587,"Thanks all, I appreciate all the kind words.  I never had any doubt that what I did was the right thing for Dallas, and I have done it before and will do it again for all the others in my life, now and in the future.  I still have not had a chance to grieve, I've been going non stop.  Dallas is so hard to deal with maily because he was my first dog as an adult on my own, and I picked him up when he was a floppy eared 14wk old sheppard who's ears were way too big for his head.  He was a great big goofy puppy right up to his last day.  There are so many memories and special times, and maybe one day I will share some of them here....for now, I must go make breakfast with my 2yr old great nepwhew  Thanks again  Maureen"

45239,steve_paul,2007-03-10 00:43:00,658,"Maureen, it brings back alot of tough memories as we just faced this in Oct with our Goldie.  As Cliff said so beautifully, keep Dallas in your heart - they will always be there.  There are very few people in our lives who are as good, loyal, friendly and loving as our dogs."
45246,Jigatollah,2007-03-10 00:58:00,53,I've lost four dogs myself and know that this is a very tough decision to be made. Thay are just like kids and part of the family.Loyal to the end.

45259,Nanook,2007-03-10 01:33:00,565,"Very sad indeed Moe ! So sorry to hear it. Its never easy to do, as many have said. As pet 'owners' we have the responsibility to keep them from suffering,and you have made the right decision,however hard. Had to do it a few times myself,not easy. Got Pic's of all our dogs on the walls, Pet's do not get forgotten!"
45272,tonyb,2007-03-10 01:46:00,1637,"So sorry to hear of the heartaching news.  I am a dog lover and a cat lover now too, and they are family members not pets.  Cliff, you have a way with words, that's a great way of putting it.  I have a soft spot for our furry pals, this is choking me up.  Sad for you, Tony"
45280,Frankypro,2007-03-10 02:00:00,63,"Moe,  We've never met, but I know your situation like it was yesterday.   Be strong at time like this and be there for your freind.  I have had to say Good-bye to a loved dog not too long ago- she had a tumor.  Now we have 11 yr old and 1 yr old Labs and can see that picture coming again soon.   Big Cliff says it best...I still remember and love that Jessie dog."
45290,Shelley Cooper,2007-03-10 02:18:00,394,aaaaawwwwwh.. Mo... thats so sad.. a tough thing to go through...  Hold onto the memories Mo...  Hugz.. Shelley

45332,bpsbassman,2007-03-10 04:03:00,941,"I'm terribly sorry about Dallas Moe.  The day I had to take my lab for that last drive was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.  I cried like a baby afterwards, but knew it was the right thing to do. Take comfort in knowing you did the best thing for him and remember all the good times. Give your other dogs a big hug.  They will help you get through this."
45340,bigfish1965,2007-03-10 04:57:00,3382,"I know one day I will be faced with this decision. I hope I have the courage to do what is right for my dogs, as you have done,  and not be tempted to appease my own suffering and prolong my pet's. Sorry for your loss."
45368,Photoz,2007-03-10 11:21:00,792,"I'm so sorry to hear about your beloved pet . . . . .      to me, it is not 'just a dog' that is lost, but a bona fide member of the family. As you likely know, I have a lot of 'my own pets,' doggies that I always have 'treats' for on my mail route . . . . .     every so often the inevitable happens, and I lose one . . . . .    I feel like hell for days. I've only ever owned ONE dog . . .     when I was a kid . . . . .    never foud another that could stand up to his memory, nor had any desire to lose ANOTHER 'best friend.' At least you gave him a good life, and were strong enough to end his suffering when there was no more hope."
45398,TJQ,2007-03-10 14:32:00,7806,Hey mo....   sorry to hear that.  us doggie owners feel for ya.

45467,Squid,2007-03-10 19:50:00,1656,Very sad day. I'm terribly sorry about Dallas Moe. May he rest in peace.
45469,DebS,2007-03-10 19:58:00,56,"Mo, that is the saddest news to hear. Take heart in knowing what a difference you made in Dallas' life. Your guys are all lucky to have a ""mom"" who loves them so much. I went through it myself and I know how much it hurts but hold onto your memories of all the good times you shared with Dallas & let your other guys help you through this sad time. So very sorry for your loss....Deb"
45470,Bernie,2007-03-10 20:08:00,3190,Maureen. Very sorry about your dog. I would not have realized how attached you can become to them until we got our pooch. Don't want to think about when that day comes for him. Take care....Bernie
45488,Kerry,2007-03-10 22:08:00,383,I truly feel for you Maureen.I had to put my cat of 17 years down a few years ago of lung cancer of which I was the culprit.It was Calico's way of saying to quit smoking as I realized the last two weeks of her life were not good at all and it was heartwrenching to let her go.I quit shortly thereafter.My wife had been pining for a dog for a while and we finally decided to get one.We named our Shi Tzu Skooby Do and he is now 8 years old.We have no kids so he is our child;I can't imagine not coming home and seeing him waiting for me in the window.He is so much a part of our life day in day out. Time will heal the pain but the tears are flowing just going back remembering and memories keep them close to our hearts. Take care Maureen. Kerry and Cheryl
45491,pameladallaire,2007-03-10 22:14:00,470,Poor Maureen.  Pam
45561,Beans,2007-03-11 02:30:00,3339,Maureen is still too emotionally upset to reply here yet...she will soon...she worked all day and is wiped out...  Thanks for your words of encouragement for her gang...
45097,Beans,2007-03-09 19:07:00,3339,"She just got a call on her cell phone from her vet that ""Dallas"" will have to be put down...Unfortunately the bone tumor has weakened the bone in his leg so much that he broke the leg earlier today...very sad for sure as he was a beauty...    For those that believe in such things...maybe send up a prayer for Motv8tr to have the strength to weather this storm...  Thanks Guys/Gals"
45101,misfish,2007-03-09 19:10:00,29133,There are alot of dog owners here Beans and we all know this is very painful to go through. Some of us have and I for one.  Sorry to hear Mo.
45103,fishnsled,2007-03-09 19:14:00,3520,"Maureen,  It is never easy having to put down a pet.  In fact they are not just a pet, they are family.  Having recently had to do the same thing and I know what you're going through.  Be assured that time will make things easier and the memories with be with you a lifetime.  Will"
45105,Loonietoon,2007-03-09 19:16:00,1450,"Maureen, I know it is going to be tuff, but I also know you will get through it. It will take a while I know because I have had to do it a few times , But as all is said remember the good times you have had and the love and care that you gave to your baby...."
45111,Garyv,2007-03-09 19:40:00,547,"Maureen as I mentioned to Beans you have to remember that what you are accepting as a responsible pet owner is out of love and desire to do the right thing for Dallas.  It's a hard thing to accept, but in time you will still feel the loss but will have the happier memories remain with you forever.  Hang in there and give that extra love to your other pets...Dallas would want it that way."
45114,ccmtcanada,2007-03-09 19:43:00,7971,Maureen....  We are very sorry to hear of the news about Dallas.  Our thoughts are with you during this time...  Cliff and Carole (bly)

45178,bigbuck,2007-03-09 22:28:00,2449,It's one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do but it's better for your friend. I had to put down my dog almost 6 years ago and every time I go to my parents' house I always look to see if he's trotting around the corner to say hello. Take care and be strong in this difficult time.

It really helped getting through the tough times. I now have 2 dogs and sometimes think if my other didn't pass away, I would've never known the love these two bring. My heart goes out to you."
