The deal they offer is $59 for 3 days/2 nights in one of 18 destinations including Shenandoah, VA, Fort Lauderdale, FL and several others.  I am very skeptical by nature, but sometimes that skepticism can result in missed opportunities.  Anyone have any experience good or bad? Feel free to PM me if you would rather not post to this thread.  Thanks,  HG"

I ran into too much of that type of crap years ago in Florida. You know the type of deal, ""Free Disney tickets"" or ""Cheap Tickets"" that sort of thing where they make you sit through a high pressure sales pitch. I can't be bothered wasting my time.  But then I could be wrong, but I could be right, so I proceed with caution."
