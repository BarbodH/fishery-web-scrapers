45981,Headhunter,2007-03-12 13:08:00,5703,Thanks for the kind words everyone! I simply put an old friend and a relatively new friend (Gerritt) together! My old friend had a real need for some help and I saw Gerritt as a good fit! Best of luck Gerritt... Marcus is a great guy and I'm sure you'll enjoy working for him! HH
45982,Headhunter,2007-03-12 13:09:00,5703,Opps! double post!

46119,aplumma,2007-03-12 19:43:00,6896,Well...... how did your day go? Did you remember to bring the new boss a shinny red apple? Were your shoes shined and your hair slicked back? first impressions are ever lasting.  Art
46124,douG,2007-03-12 20:00:00,2693,"Under promise and over deliver, and cooperate with everyone until and unless they don't cooperate with you.  Those two things will take you a long way.  Good Luck, Gerritt, and keep smiling."
46139,Gerritt,2007-03-12 20:41:00,6129,"Thanks everyone!  I had a fantastic day! things went smoothly, I was shown around and was given a desk etc, was shown the filing system etc... My boss and I worked together throughout the day, was given a bunch of responsibility and made some key decisions (mainly moving them to High Speed internet etc...) Bought some new computer hardware.... Also had a bit of excitement mixed in there as well, but I will save that for perhaps another day.....  All in all a great day and cant wait to get back at it tomorrow!  Gerritt."
46143,Bernie,2007-03-12 20:49:00,3190,Good stuff Gerritt. Glad to see things are looking well for you.
46144,Corey,2007-03-12 20:52:00,355,"Hope they aren't buying any Mac crap. High speed internet, so Gerritt doesn't have to do the dialup dance at lunch to look at everyone else fishing while he is working eh."
46195,Carp,2007-03-12 23:29:00,1488,Congradulations bud.  I'm sure you'll do just fine at the new position.  Another example why I'm proud to be an OFNCer. Nice move head hunter.

45725,Gerritt,2007-03-11 15:37:00,6129,"Well as everyone here knows I have been dealing with a busted hand and as a result of that I was unable to work without serious pain in my present occcupation. A couple weeks ago I made a post here on OFC if anyone knew of any positions available as I was having difficulty finding any decent jobs here in Hamilton that weren't General Labour positions. While I had a great deal of responses via PM wishing me good luck, and even a couple odd job inqueries. That is until I received a PM from a certain person here that deals in job placements......HeadHunter..... Turns out he had a client/friend that was looking for someone with my exact qualifications, Some that is able to read blueprints, knows the trades, and has sound computer skills. I was put into contact with this firm and a interview was lined up. I was the only candidate and the only one interviewed for this position. All this transpired over the last two weeks.... and I am happy to say I start back to work tomorrow!!! Man am I looking forward to getting back into the mix!  So in this post I want to publicly thank Headhunter for all the work he put forth to make this happen..... Thank YOU!  I would also like to thank everyone that sent me their best wishes and letters of encouragement.... Thank YOU!   I will be spending less hours here a day... I hope the withdrawal is not to bad!!!   Enjoy the day folks... it is beautiful outside!!  Me? I will be at the outlaws for supper.   Gerritt."

45734,Garyv,2007-03-11 16:49:00,547,Fantastic... it takes the worry of supporting your family away.  I fished with HH when he was in my area 2 years ago and found him to be a nice person ( he didn't complain when we didn't catch any smallmouth ) so I'm not surprised he was able to help you.  Enjoy the new job!
45739,Tybo,2007-03-11 16:56:00,1373,"WOOHOOOOOO, Its about time.  No more babblings from Gerritt  Tybo"

45772,Corey,2007-03-11 20:06:00,355,"Good stuff... I know Headhunter had something lined up for me as well, but I ended up taking a job much closer to home. Joe (Headhunter) is excellent to deal with and gives solid advice for people to tweak out their resume's and such and can find you a job if you have the right stuff.  Enjoy the drive Gerritt  cd."
