46107,drufis,2007-03-12 19:11:00,45,"Terry, now that was wild to watch.  Thanks for sharing."
46122,misfish,2007-03-12 19:56:00,29133,  HOOTERS     Maybe we can get a few others out there as well. Saturday is a work day so Sunday is the day.
46127,Cookslav,2007-03-12 20:14:00,1457,Very cool little video... Agressive little buggers....love the Swarming technique.
45573,Terry,2007-03-11 02:55:00,14456,"well  I had to get out fishing I had a late night Friday so I didn't get out till 830..but that's OK simcoe perch can't tell time.... I  went to Keswick south end and just followed the plowed road out past  the fish huts..lots a cars parked on  the ice and more driving  around....... well set up shop..drilled a few holes set up the fishfinder  drop a lure then drop the camera I started the camera just before I let it down the hole and started recording  not a fish in sight......I did an old trick that still works as I found out today I took all the hooks of a Williams whitefish and started jigging it like crazy well..30 seconds later in come them tasty little buggers... they would come in waves, then disappear again  for  the  most part I used a little spoon but they wanted it sitting still  to bite it most times and jigging to draw them near, I caught about 40  of them..let them all go  it was nice and warm, I had to remove my survivor suit here are some pictures             <object  width=""425"" height=""350""><param name=""movie""  value=""    now when is that open water coming..."
45574,lunkerbasshunter,2007-03-11 03:11:00,2585,man that looked like alot of fun!!!! loved the video it was excting watching them get pulled up!  Cheers!
45579,007,2007-03-11 03:20:00,537,Great Report Terry.  The two times I fished Cooks Bay this winter I also found that the perch were attracted by the movement of the bait but often didn't bite until it was stationary or slightly moving.  Wish I had one of those underwater cameras rather than fishing blind. I might have hit more of the bites!  Great to see what it's like down there though.  Thanks. 007
45583,Joey,2007-03-11 03:26:00,9122,"Hey guys, look at the shiny thing bobbing around over here....... Hey, where'd Kenny go.   Nooooooooo   Ha ha ha, that was cool Terry.  Every time I see those underwater camera videos, I am amazed at how light it is down there.  Thanks for the report.  It does look pretty slushy tho.  Joey"
45610,tinbanger,2007-03-11 04:16:00,1028,"Great report Terry  Looks like you weren't board!  Got the whole family out today at Gilford . Mover around abit , kinda quiet but Pikeie did get a decent perch .  Pics to follow once I find my cable for the camera.  TB"
45611,Bly,2007-03-11 04:21:00,1556,Interesting to see just how the fish react to the bait and what finally triggers them to bite.  40 fish....nice day on the ice  bly
45638,danbo,2007-03-11 10:46:00,2646,Mezmerizing video bro! Looks like those perch want some action in the lures at all times! Smaller baits would give fewer misses & more bites I think. Fun City!
45639,b2kptbo,2007-03-11 10:48:00,1505,"Good stuff, thanks..."
45644,ccmtcanada,2007-03-11 11:42:00,7971,Wow!  That was really cool!  That underwater camera sure adds to your reports.  It was really cool to see them crowd around your lure like that and the see them zip upwards after the hook was set.  Thanks!
45651,Big Cliff,2007-03-11 12:00:00,6899,"terry, that is one of the best reports I think I have ever seen! As you know (or might remember) I bought one of those Aquaview cameras last year, still haven't had a chance to really try it out but after watching that video I am going to get it all rigged up to go very first chance I get.  Thanks again for the report!  Big Cliff"
45671,Terry,2007-03-11 12:59:00,14456,"Cliff, yup I remember you got one....... they are a lot of fun pan fish fishing is the best time to use it, but I will be checking out some walleye spots in the spring too......  I am glad people like the videos, I was fishing for 2 hours and had the same amount of vids. about 40 fish being caught..I only showed a few of them I was going to show how well the big spoon brought the perch in  and what not, but when I put the first ones together as a movie I saved it to the memory card rather then the computer and it crashed the memory card and I lost all the rest of the video clips...oh well live and learn..always transfer the files from the memory card to the computer before you start playing with them....."
