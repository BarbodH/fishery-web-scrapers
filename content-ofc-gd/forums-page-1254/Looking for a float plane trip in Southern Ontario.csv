45595,007,2007-03-11 03:56:00,537,Hey folks.  My wife says she would like to book a float plane trip for my 30th birthday in June this year - something I've always wanted to do.     However she hasn't been able to find much info for southern Ontario.  Any suggestions where I could get such a trip?  I'm based in Toronto - does anyone know if they have float plane trips from the Island airport to lakes up north or would I have to travel somewhere else first then take a plane north?  Perhaps someone can suggest an operator or perhaps a fly-in fishing lodge?  Any ideas on price would be good too as I have no idea how much a trip would be and even if we can afford it!  Any help would be appreciated.  Cheers 007

I looked into a trip a couple of years back.  Drive to Sudbury, fly to an Airport further in the boonies, about 2 hours.  Catch a float plane there and fly a couple of hours further.  I didn't end up going.  Good luck with it though and keep us posted on what you find out."

45608,007,2007-03-11 04:10:00,537,Hi Dutch.  Thanks for the reply.  I guess I will have the same problem you had - not being able to find an operator close by and having to drive a long way north first - which is not something I really want to do. I was hoping I might find an operator near Toronto or at worst within a few hours of T.O and then see where they fly to.  I don't mind doing a day trip just for the expereince though the thought of a longer fly-in fishing trip sounds good too. 007

45612,Dutch,2007-03-11 04:35:00,831,"That Stanton Air places looks interesting.  Secluded fishing not too far away, might be good for a day or two trip.  Bass fishing looks to be the the thing with all those lakes though.  Just my opinion, but I would be looking further North for fly-in - with Walleye and Pike fishing.  Especially since Walleye are getting more scare here in the South, don't catch enough for table-fare anymore.  It would be nice to get away to where they are more plentiful and catch a stringer or two.  Also, on those smaller lakes I find the small bass soooo aggresive, since they have to compete for food with the big-uns, that you are constantly catching 8""-12"" fish.  In the end I guess that's not so bad, but for a fly-in trip I would be looking for a little bit more.  Again, only my opinion."
