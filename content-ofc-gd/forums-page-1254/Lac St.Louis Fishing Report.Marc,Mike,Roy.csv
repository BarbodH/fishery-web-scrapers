Sad to hear your comments on the St. Lawrence Marc; however, I do remember when fishing Lake St. Francis 20-25 years ago, the commercial fishing was in full swing and I guess that coupled with the other factors you mentioned is taking its toll.   I still consider it the waters I learned to fish on."

46012,mattyk,2007-03-12 14:47:00,2110,Nice report. I guess we need to do more to protect our waterways and fisheries.

45691,Marc Thorpe,2007-03-11 13:34:00,621,"Yes Lew its true,not many  know of this. I work closely with the ministry and they turn often to me for my observatiosn and compare to other observations and after 15 years,they realize not to use my results but to use the common anglers results,because my results are skewed because of my continuous presence.I think over the years with mistakes they have made,they keep the info provided on the QT and act upon it,unfortunatly they are 10 years too late Its not in good shape,there are talks about including the Otttawa  Reasons of population decline are as you mentioned (Fishing pressure,commercial fishing from past,perch population decline because of resale by local anglers cutting a fat rat,disease,warming of the waters by 4 degrees)  Pollution is somewhat much better than 20 years ago  Lew not much to bring up in a seperate thread,simply lack of info and data leading to the reasons why Honestly ,I dont think folks would really like to hear my opinion on why fisheries decline It encompasses far too much in which some will be ruffled I see no reason for 50 perch limits,6 walleye limits,6 pike limites When is the last time you saw someone eating 6 walleyes or pike or 50 perch? I would suggest 3 as a limit for walleye and pike and 15 to 20 perch should be plenty IN POSSESSION "" In Possession "" In other words At home or in your boat or day of fishing combined That is problably the biggest violation we as anglers are negatively impacting all species Dont kid yourself 60-75% of un-informed anglers are breaking the law,why such a high number simply because these anglers comprise of most of the anglers who use fishing as an occasional hobby without regularety and when purchasing a license they are not informed of the basic laws by the establishement providing these licenses  We've seen the debates of location info sharing on this site and Lew you know my position on it 10% of the anglers catch 90% of the fish,why you ask,simply because 10% of the anglers do not pay attention to where 90% of the anglers are fishing  I suspect its not one thing but many factors which have led to this Most puzzling is species like channel catfish and sturgeon are thriving but other species are declinning.I suspect this may have direct correalation with habitat and fishing pressure  We as anglers are accountable for the decline of our resources,we must take notice and be conscience of our presence and negative impacts on our resources and act accordingly if we wish it to survive. There's something to be learned from Native tradittions and how some still survive off the land.Using these methods of living and enjoying the resources in harmony with it without abusing it will allow it to survive and flourish We as humans are by far the biggest netagive impact on our resources when our behaviors towards it are diss-resspectfull We are changing for the better somewhat,education must continue for futur generations  Unfortunatly Catch and release will not cut it and is not enough to bring back the health of the St Lawrence  The basic forlmula to recovering somewhat stable populations is acting upon the forage Stabilize Perch,Emerald shinners populations and then we will open the flood gates for other species to flourish ,but thats too simple"
45698,Marc Thorpe,2007-03-11 14:07:00,621,"Getting back to the thread,the weather was splendid I suspect we released some 20 perch or so and kept 30 perch all together For awhile,the tip ups were going off continuously,lots of fun in warm weather Good breath of Mother Nature's air with some good people"
