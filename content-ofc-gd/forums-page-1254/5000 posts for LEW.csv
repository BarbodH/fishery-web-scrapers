45709,DT10Sam,2007-03-11 14:30:00,480,"There is no way on earth that Lew made all of those posts.......all of you  on here are getting fooled far too easily. I'm sure if you check his keyboard you will see Marvin's prints all over it. Way to go Marv for helping Lew get the credit for over 5000 posts.  Regards, Sam"
45711,Roy,2007-03-11 14:40:00,13728,"FRIENDS like Lew are what makes OFC what it it. Truth be told, Lew is probably way, way over the 5,000 mark because of posts lost due to the many board upgrades we've had over the years. Yes, Lew has dispensed more than his share of good advice, tips, reports, pics and personal feelings about things. Way to go, Bud."
