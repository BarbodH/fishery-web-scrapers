We arrived at about 8:30 and met with hopped on board the nada argo to be brought onto the Ice. unfortunately the bite was slow but we did manage to catch 8 of em, all approx 7 inches... Heres a couple of pictures on the Ice.  Simcoes landscape...    The minnows... not much smaller than the perch we caught and they were much more abundant    A picture down the hole... kinda cool how much light there is almost like the ice is a spotlight...   And the star of the day, a 7 3/4 "" perch!    althought the bite wasn't all that great for us we did enjoy ourselves and it was much warmer in the hut than it would have been out in the wind... Thanks for reading..."
