45742,Garyv,2007-03-11 17:03:00,547,"Sorry to hear about the stones, he didn't need another kick in the butt.  At least it will pass in time, but it's still not nice."
45744,Bassman27,2007-03-11 17:13:00,98,Hopefully he passes it quick.Get Better  Bassman
45746,misfish,2007-03-11 17:17:00,29133,"I seen this thread and said oh no,WFT now.  Take care of the big guy."
45773,Corey,2007-03-11 20:10:00,355,"Wooo here we go again... glad it was just a stone and nothing more serious. He should go see a renal dietician now. I know all about kidney stones... 1.3cm on one side and 1.4 cm on the other, fortunately or unfortunately, mine are a wee bit too big to pass and I will be headed under the knife for the 3rd time to remove my stones. Percacets are awesome.  cd."
45776,Chuck Best,2007-03-11 20:17:00,308,"Thanks to everyone for the kind words and well wishes.....I've been snoozing off and on today with no pain and it seems to have sub-sided for now but the doc seemed to be sure that it will be back and so will I(in the hospital)........She seemed to think that it probably moved to my bladder today and the next move will be expulsion.....BOYohBOY,I can't wait........any hoooo thanks again all and I'll let you all know how things WORK OUT.....(OUCH).....TC and tight lines.....Chuck..."
45780,Rich Clemens,2007-03-11 20:29:00,3131,"I feel your pain bud.  My father went through a bout last year.  Fortunately they eventually passed.  My grandfather had them, now my father, so I guess I'm next in line.  Thank goodness it wasn't anything serious.  Take it easy."
45802,express168,2007-03-11 21:40:00,327,"Take care and rest, I was there a few years back. Working during the hot summer and wasn't keeping hydrated enough and wound up with a stone.Glad it isn't anything more serious."
45805,aplumma,2007-03-11 21:49:00,6896,How did the rocks in your head get into your kidney???? My doctor said that laughter makes the stones pass quicker..... he did not tell me how to laugh when you got that much pain. He did get me some demeral that really made me giddy though. Once the stone is in the bladder the pain stops and the uriter is much bigger so the passing is easier. My doc made me strain my urine so they could biopsy it the dam thing looked like a sea urchin..... I will stop here for you faint of hearts. I am glad it was nothing to do with your other recovery bud so get well soon.  Art
45890,Loonietoon,2007-03-12 01:17:00,1450,Chuck.. You had better take care of your self  OR you might end up in HAMMERTOWN again... like you need that.... Take care Bud

I spent several hours in the emerge only a couple weeks back when mine started it journey to see daylight . . . .   it's stopped again . .. and you NEVER know, till it starts moving again . . . .     THEN YOU KNOW!! Although it won't kill you, it can sure make you THINK you're dying! It's about the only thing I know of that would make Chuck holler 'UNCLE!' Or take him away from his fishing! Good luck . . . .    let us know!"

45690,OhioFisherman,2007-03-11 13:31:00,6623,"Shelley my buddy gets them, not a fun thing. Keep an eye on him! My buddy passed out from pain the first one he got, his wife thought he had a heart attack!"

45700,TJQ,2007-03-11 14:16:00,7806,Hes a tough old bugger....
45703,JFR,2007-03-11 14:19:00,498,"The both of you don't need this.  Speedy passage and recovery, both of you are in my thoughts  John"
45704,Beans,2007-03-11 14:23:00,3339,"Boys oh boys!...I don't envy him one bit...been there and done that...Couldn't sit, couldn't stand, couldn't lie down, pacing helped somewhat...  Some hospitals have the ultrasound eqipment that blasts the stone into tiny little pieces and makes passing much easier...of course mine didn't...  I hope he is feeling better soon..."
45705,wuchikubo,2007-03-11 14:23:00,1114,"I'm glad to hear he's feeling better, I hope he'll have a speedy recovery. I'm still hoping to meet you two one of these days!  Stan"

45714,JEREMY,2007-03-11 14:56:00,300,Gladto hear it was not anything major.Hers to a speedy return.
45715,Joey,2007-03-11 14:58:00,9122,"Well I just got up and noticed this.  Glad everything isn't more serious and he's going to be okay.  I've never had the pleasure of passing a stone, and hope I never do.  I hear it can be very painful.  Hope the doc gave Chuck some cheap drugs for the pain.  Tell him Paul's in a world of pain here too this weekend.  Our fishing plans went to crap also.  On Friday afternoon at work he got his thumb caught in a machine.  Its turning more and more purple as the weekend goes by and it hurts just to move it.  At least the swelling has gone down some.  I know its not a kidney stone, but its still pain - Ouch!!!    So maybe Chuck won't feel so bad knowing his buddy is stuck at home in pain too  Joey"
