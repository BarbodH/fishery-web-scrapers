The trick is that I wil give you a total of them (adding ) after I see yours first Number. how it works?  1. type any 5 didgit number (here or PM ) 2. I will post or send (pm ) the answer 3. type the second 5 digit number 4 I will type my 5 digit number 5 Add them all and you will have an answer ( see 2)  The trick is : I have no idea what your second number will be ( but I have already the  total ) Anybody wants  to try ?

45785,keram,2007-03-11 20:47:00,585,You cannot round it up (or down ) because you will have to cut some horses in pieces   ( condition was they have to be alive). This is how it works:  The mistake you did not noticed is that ( adding fractions here ) 1/2 +1/6 + 1/9 =17/18 not 18/18 ( 1 hord ) So what they did ? ( I do not know if it was the oldest ( experienced ) or youngest ( smartest ) but they've borrowed one horse from the neighbour. Now they have 18 horses. 1/2 of 18 is 9 1/3 of 18 is 6 1/9 of 18 is 2  9 + 6 + 2 =17  They have one horse extra. Returned it to the neighbour and everybody is happy.
45793,keram,2007-03-11 21:11:00,585, I do not agree and this is why:  In your calculation a square – b square = (a - b )(a + b ) it is not true ( reserved my explanation for later)

45902,kemper,2007-03-12 01:40:00,2232,"""a square – b square = (a - b )(a + b )""  Thats false. And heres why...  You have to expand (a-b )(a+b ), using FOIL.

The error has nothing to do with multiplying both sides by the same factor.  Going farther is getting even worse. Because 10$ is  equal to 0.1c  10$ = 1000c 1000 = 10 X 10 X 10 10c = 0.1$ thus 0.1 X 0.1 X 0.1 = 0.001 1000c (1$) =0.001$ so 10$ = 0.1c  This is the hint from your calculation"
