It was taken in 1911 about 400 feet from where I live today on Lower Lake Huron.  Sorry for the quality but the picture was emailed to me after being taken at a local museum.  The caption reads ""The total catch of 143 fish included 28 Perch and 115 Black Bass Seventy fish were given away before the picture was taken""  No one realized then what would/could happen but must admit it had to be one heck of a good time for these two guys!

45827,Guest gbfisher,2007-03-11 22:51:00,0,  different spieces and sizes..  ..I'd call that selective harvest.
45895,Greencoachdog,2007-03-12 01:24:00,8163,If it's got a pair of eyes and a butthole... It's A Keeper!!!
45899,Canuck2fan,2007-03-12 01:31:00,1444,Now if we could only get the commercial fishing boats to practice catch and release on the Great Lakes.... They still take catches 20 to 200 times that big everyday they go out.
45927,POLLIWOGG,2007-03-12 04:04:00,835,C+R was started because the sport fishing industry sponsored TV fishing shows were breaking the law every show and the regs were changed to suit the poachers. Unlimited C+R was not legal till I think somewhere in the 80's. Before C+R the limit was a catch limit not a keep limit but was not enforced.
