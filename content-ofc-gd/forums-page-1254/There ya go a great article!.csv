46152,Rich Clemens,2007-03-12 21:18:00,3131,That's the one article I printed off for my archives.   I agree ... great read.
46162,douG,2007-03-12 22:02:00,2693,"Agree again.  A welcome change from the 'As some of you all know.... but' stuff.  IMO that level of writing has no reason to be published.  Get a mentor already.  Do some reading yourself to see what speaks to you.  JP is a great fisherman because he always has a plan,  and commitment to work that plan.  Thanks to the original wildman for that great article."
46185,TJQ,2007-03-12 22:50:00,7806,Glad ya guys liked it...  I also got this really cool email ... happens whenever I think no ones actually reading this stuff....  --------------------------  
46187,Roy,2007-03-12 22:59:00,13728,"That IS a nice email to receive, TJ. Never kid yourself, people are reading the OFC newsletter from the four corners of the earth.....I know a few who are reading in Australia.. JP is one of a kind when it comes to the outdoors. Give yourself a pat on the back for making it happen TJ......ok, ok  pat Monique on the back too then. Great stuff!"
