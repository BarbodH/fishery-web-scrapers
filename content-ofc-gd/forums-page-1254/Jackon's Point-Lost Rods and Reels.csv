The good news is we broke our ice fishing season skunk with a 5lb Whitefish, and numerous misses.  The bad news is we went to unpack the car and realized our bucket complete with several rod/reel combo's was missing .  I know it's a long shot, but I thought I would post here just in case an OFC'er came across it.  They were left just above the launch ramp at the end of the parking lot.  Thanks either way, guys."
