45858,fishindevil,2007-03-12 00:00:00,6254,"well thats to bad you got skunked all winter,where were you fishing all those times,you might have to go over your stratagies,and do a new game plan..  ..were you going real early in the morning,and of course staying for the late afternoon & after dark bite,that can be the best 20mins of the day,sometimes after sundown ya can get em real good ..  ..sometimes we will get walleyes 3hrs,after dark and hit 3-4 fish in a half hour,let us know what you were doing and maybe we can help you out a little,....cheers    dont give-up"

45865,Mike the Pike,2007-03-12 00:10:00,3421,Thats fishing you get skunked   .Sooner or later you will be on to fish.I suggest renting an ice hut.the operators of the huts will put you on fish.I know how you feel about drilling holes yesterday it took me a good five minutes to go through almost 3 feet of ice for one hole to move my son to another location.An 8 inch hand auger requires alot of elbow grease eventhough the auger is new.Keep tryin it does become rewarding .Like fishin Devil says tell us how you are fishing and many people can help.MTP

45993,camillj,2007-03-12 14:10:00,1988,Yep .. know the feeling ... not even a BITE all season .... thats serious .... but then the REAL problem is I didnt get out ENOUGH ... and it was all over too FAST  (I say its over .. cause .. welll ... now that the steel are thick and furious ... it seems silly spend a day sitting idly by on the ice (if there even is any) ... on the other hand ... if I go up to Muskoka this weekend ... well .. ya know its gonna be ice fer sure
