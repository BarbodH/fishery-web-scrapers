46232,setomonkey,2007-03-13 01:49:00,872,"I've fished Kahshe a number of times, there are also pike, smallmouth, and walleye.  You might be able to find out more about the species if you find the Guide To Eating Sportfish. Will tell you how clean the water is if you want to keep fish but will also tell you what species are present.  Mike"
