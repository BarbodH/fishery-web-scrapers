Not a good thing for a Canadian. I was there for the NASCAR race, and after the big event we decided to walk over to the restaurant/bar area which is a mile or so from the track. Half way there I knew that I had to do my business, so my buddy kept walking while I did my thing. Next thing I knew, the grass in front of me was flashing red. Damn. I yelled to my buddy ""Is that the COPS?"" A voice right behind me advised me that yes, it was indeed the COPS. They were parked about 8 feet behind me. I didn't even hear the car. Yikes. I'm in trouble now. After a stern lecture, and explaining that I was from Canada, the conversation turned light hearted and a few laughs were shared. Good guys they were. Thank God."

The law does not specifically define what constitutes a public place, and a variety of facts and circumstances may be relevant to that determination. Streets, sidewalks, the strip of grass between the street and sidewalk are almost certain to be considered public places. Your yard, patio or porch may be a public place if you do not control access to it. If you allow anyone to enter, then it could be considered ""public."" If you party on your lawn and are not scrupulous about keeping outsiders away, your lawn may be considered a public place. Areas shared by more than one apartment or building are usually considered public. Inside your apartment or house, with the door shut, is usually a private place.

I told him i had permission and whatnot, even told him who would steal a lawn mower then use it a block away? Haha. He agreed. Then he talked to me for a good 45 mins about the differences between his mower and the one i borrowed. I even excused myself briefly to grab a beer during that time.

798779,aplumma,2013-07-18 19:29:00,6896,It is the fact that your willie is exposed not if someone can see it. The cops can write the ticket for public urination and exposure if it is visible.

You say, ""It is the fact that your willie is exposed not if someone can see it""...then go on to say, ""The cops can write the ticket for public urination and exposure if it is visible"".  Those two statements seem to contradict one another.  Also...the definition of exposed (in this context) is ""to make something visible, typically by uncovering it"".  How could someone claim I exposed my genitals if they never saw them?...if they weren't visible, they weren't (by definition) exposed.  As far as not be able to ""wiggle or touch it in any manner that is not needed to urinate""...if no one can see my Johnson...how can they tell whether or not I gave it an extra shake or two?  Not that it matters...I don't plan on masturbating in my backyard anyway, I just want to take a squirt...and I'm quite able to do the latter without doing the former."

If I am in the store and turn my back to the public and unzip and urinate in a pot rezip and no one saw the stream or my zipper down however a cop comes up and sees the wet planter and heard my zipper being pulled up he can write the ticket. You will go to court and fight it but the cop only needs probable cause to write the ticket it is up to the judge to make the ruling. Exposure can be charged without seeing the actual bits if a girl has her back to a cop and opens her shirt he can write the exposure ticket even though he did not get to see the bits of her. If he writes the ticket for urination and or exposure and you go what the hay and wiggle said digit at him it becomes a lewd act thus another charge. Mind you this is all tongue and cheek here and it would be a waste of the courts resources for the ticket to be written if you discreetly water a plant in the back yard.

In some instances you could be charged for doing it on your own property, however it would vary by municipality.  It's unlikely to happen to be honest, unless your peeling on your neighbours car at 3am, and your caught in the act,  while officers are attending the blowout base thumping party at your residence.

I'm not asking about taking a leak outside of the bathroom in a public place such as a store that belongs to someone else...obviously that is something you can't do and the situation you described has little to nothing to do with the situation I am asking about.  I'm even more confused about your second example.  First of all, I thought women in Ontario were allowed to go shirtless, just as men can do.  Secondly, if the woman had her back to everyone present, not just the cop, and opened her blouse but no one was able to see her ""exposed"" skin, what crime did she commit?"

I'm not a proprietor of an establishment that sells liquor to the public...I'm just some guy who owns property and likes the taste of a cold beer on a hot day.  I'd love to see a cop try and charge me for having an open container of alcohol in my front yard...because I'd fight it and win and then shove the ticket in the cop's face and say, ""Nah nah nah nah nah nah...told ya so!""  Maybe I'd get charged for that...but I'd skate on the open container beef.  In the bars in the city where I live, you can go back and forth between the indoor and patio sections all you want regardless of whether or not you have a drink in your hand.  Of course you can't leave the ""licensed"" area of the patio with a drink...just as you can't walk out the front door of the place with a drink.  What's ""wacky"" about that?  Just as importantly, what does it have to do with peeing in my yard?"
