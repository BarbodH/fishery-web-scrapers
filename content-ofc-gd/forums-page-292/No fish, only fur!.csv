799399,tbayboy,2013-07-21 22:06:00,1497,Decided to beat the heat by putting on plastic overalls (waders) and strolling down the Grand River for a bit yesterday - yeah that was a bit toasty. The fishing was pretty much dead  - 2 rock bass and one smallie not much bigger than the rockies but when I looked over at the shore I got a little shore side entertainment watching 2 minks playing in the water that I thought I'd share.    Sorry for the lousy camera shot (full zoom on a point and shoot)

799874,Mike Pike,2013-07-24 15:52:00,1332,"I love wading for bass on the Grand as well.  At this one spot I hit, I nearly always see minks on the far bank while I'm fishing.  Nice to enjoy, particularly when the fishing is slow.  Thanks for posting that Tbay."
