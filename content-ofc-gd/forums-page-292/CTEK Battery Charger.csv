799855,Fish Farmer,2013-07-24 13:55:00,2234,"I bought mine at CT, wish Princess had them back then. $40 is a good price. Only thing I learned they aren't a charger, just a maintainer. I did use it for a charger but it got very hot. I had a battery that wouldn't take a charge. I hooked up the CTEK and it brought it back to life so I could charge it. Apparently it desulphurised it."
799857,jimmer,2013-07-24 14:18:00,2730,I don't know about them not being a charger. I have used one for the past 2-3 years and it definitely charges my batteries from deep cycle to smaller 12 volt ones for my fish finder. I love it.
