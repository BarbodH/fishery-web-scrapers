800014,BillM,2013-07-25 02:48:00,17367,"Finally a custom mapping option for those of us that fish lakes that will never get coverage.  Plus you can make you own maps and not have to 'upload' them to a central system for the rest of the world to use *cough* Navionics *cough*..    Been watching a thread over on BBC, Doug Vahrenberg was nice enough to chime in and provide the info.   Check out the NEW LakeMaster AutoCharts if you have sonar recordings you will be ready to convert to AutoMaps. LakeMaster AutoChartsLakeMaster allows you take your sonar recordings and in a simple 3 Step Process convert them into LakeMaster Contour Charts for use on your Humminbird. This is an accessory product that can be used in conjuntion with your current LakeMaster Maps. Want to increase the details of your favorite fishing area, scan private waters, scan small lakes, ponds or streams or New areas. There is NO uploading or giving away the data you worked to collect. You collect it - you use the data. If you want to share with friends you can share the data too. For example 5 Boats go to Canada fishing trip all 5 record sonar data and have one copy of AutoCharts and you can import all 5 users data and create maps instantly and then save the data to each users cards and all 5 boats would get the same LakeMaster Auto Chart. Collect more data eah trip and increase the map. Take 3 Simple Steps 1 - Collect Sonar Recordings, Step 2 Upload to Computer, Step 3 Export Maps to SD card and go use them. 2 Versions AutoCharts is $199.95 and AutoChart Pro (Satellite Overlays and SI Mosiacs) $249.95 Includes CD and Mapping Card with 2 Million Zero LinesExample of Auto Chart MapExample of Bottom Harness Readings on ComputerSI Mosiac on AutoChart Pro"
800026,BassMan11,2013-07-25 11:10:00,583,Very cool
800028,Fish Farmer,2013-07-25 11:23:00,2234,"Thanks Bill, looks good. Now if they could only tell me what the fish want to eat and when I wonder how long Nav will jump on this?"
800076,bare foot wader,2013-07-25 14:55:00,1354,"cool stuff, think hummingbird will win over a lot of customers with this"
800085,bdox,2013-07-25 16:02:00,329,"You've been able to do this for years with an ethernet cable and a laptop, for free."
800089,BillM,2013-07-25 16:20:00,17367, Not on the HB units unless you've purchased Dr.Depth which was recently purchased by Johnson Outdoors.  The fact that you can overlay sat imagery is even better.
800097,bdox,2013-07-25 16:38:00,329,You only have to pay for Dr. Depth if you've got a guilty conscience
800098,BillM,2013-07-25 17:13:00,17367,"I rarely ever pay for software, but I've got no issues dropping the coin on this."
800139,Terry,2013-07-25 21:08:00,14456,but will we (in Canada) be able to use the maps we make to use the ilink minnkota feature
800158,Locnar,2013-07-25 23:14:00,645,Will this work with any humminbird... or just specific versions?
800176,BillM,2013-07-26 02:40:00,17367," Absolutely.   Says in the last chart I posted.  Locnar, I would assume this would work with any HB unit that's got chartplotter capabilities."
800178,BillM,2013-07-26 02:44:00,17367,Double post.
800194,Terry,2013-07-26 09:30:00,14456,"yeah I saw that however  (and I have no idea) does it work in Canada or do you need existing lakemaster  map  of the area, or does it work anywhere. I think the lake has to be on the autochart CD to work.........I hope it does I just really need it confirmed ,for sure as I don't own a Humminbird I am buying a iplot or ilink depending on this infomation.."
800204,BillM,2013-07-26 12:53:00,17367," Yes, it works in Canada with the maps YOU'LL be creating with the software.  Currently Lakemaster doesn't have any coverage maps that include Canada (I'm sure that will change in the very near future).  Once you've created your custom maps of any lake you want you can use your I-Pilot Link/HB combo to 'Follow the contour'"
800213,Terry,2013-07-26 15:33:00,14456,"now that's what I want to hear,  I-Pilot Link/HB combo to 'Follow the contour' would  be nice"
