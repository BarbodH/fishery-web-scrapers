We have fished Balsam for a couple years (mostly small perch) and I figure it would be nice to hook some pike for a little more excitement and I do like to eat them. We have a 14"" alum and mostly fish the East shore of  North Bay along Indian Point and the North shore of West Bay towards Mitchell Lake. Not looking for honey holes just a higher percentage area.   Thanks"
