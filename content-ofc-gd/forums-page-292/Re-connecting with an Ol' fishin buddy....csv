799572,RJackson,2013-07-22 23:53:00,113,"I met my buddy Phil about 10 years ago through our local fishing message board.  Little did we know that our first trip to the Bay of Quinte one December day (That was a disaster by the way) would turn into what would become a life long friendship.Phil has become a part of our family over the years, the kids still call him Uncle Phil and our boy Sinker runs to the window every time he sees his truck pull into the laneway.  It was a no brainer to have him stand up for me at our wedding in 2011.When I took the job working for Frito Lay in the spring of 2011 a few things changed.  99% of it was positive.  The downside of it was my schedule changed.  What was a given every weekend that Phil and I would fish now wasn’t possible due to my schedule.  It’s been tough to get used to.  We still fish a bunch together but it’s tricky to make it happen at times.When I got word Phil had taken a weeks holidays (which is unheard of) I cleared a few days of my schedule and refused to book anything.  We put plans in the works.  Local trips?  Go away for a few days to do something different?  We decided on Lake Ontario for a couple of days on the Salmon Hunt.We trailered the Lund down late in the afternoon and immediately skipped out onto the lake to try to put the pieces together for the next day.  We did so quite quickly and we excited for what the next day would bring us.When this is the first bite you get after 20 minutes of trolling it gets the heart pumping…We whooped em good...including this double header.  We did have a triple as well but that didn't have the same results..    What a gong show.We took the BBQ out in the Lund to save us running to shore for a bite to eat or to have to endure a crappy sandwich.  This was mint.We were interrupted while eating lunch...Big steelhead around too...More pics and some details on our day are here: http://www.rjnbirdeesoutdooradventures.ca/?p=1265With the sun setting we banged off a few more and headed for shore with sore shoulders, big smiles and a great feeling of spending some time with a good buddy.  Good stuff!RJ"
