I wouldn't want you too get into ""hot water"" for letting the ""cat"" out of the bag before the shows air. Sorry pun totally intentionally made."
799362,aplumma,2013-07-21 18:35:00,6896,"Nothing beats a warm evening fishing for cats. We usually line fish for them when sport fishing but when we are going for a good old fashion fish fry we (legally) break out the float rigs. They are chucks of ""noodles"" that have 3-7 ft of line depending on depth with a circle hook and a little weight. A chunk of chicken liver on each and a field of 5-7 floating slightly down river of the boat. Once a fish finds it the noodle bobs and then the chase is on. A good size fish will pull it like a drowned waterskier. We chase it down and into the cooler it goes. Sometimes you will get 2 or 3 going off at the same time and then it becomes a free for all. A good time and a great way to fish if it is legal up North.   Art"

799636,Moosebunk,2013-07-23 03:23:00,3970,"How the hiznell did I miss this???  A little outta the box this ""float fishing cats in July"" is.  Gotta say though, who wouldn't be all over catching fish like that, that way.  Cool report Aaron.  Thanks for posting."
799642,Freshtrax,2013-07-23 04:58:00,2215,Neat idea... Gotta give it a try... Might even bust out the center pin
799833,Aaron Shirley,2013-07-24 10:24:00,655,"Thanks guys. It is really fun floatin' cats!  Freshtrax, I thought hard about breaking out the pin, but with 4 in the boat it may have been cumbersome. I used a bait caster and 10'6"" rod, and that seemed to push the envelope a bit lol"
