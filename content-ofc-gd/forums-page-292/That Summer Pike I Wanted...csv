799383,Rich,2013-07-21 19:57:00,3927,"Came a few weeks ago.  Posted on OFC before heading out on a couple week long summer conquest for a decent SW Ontario pike... and what can I say? All the great information folks here were kind enough to share mixed with a little real life curveballs, all paid off on day 3.  After only catching bass (albeit some real big ones) for the first few days, I was skeptical of the ponds we were fishing. But something went right that day. A small hammer handle followed my senko in when I was taking a ""bass break"" (pike baits hurt the arms after a while) , quickly I reached for the closest pike lure I had tied on which happened to be a Musky Buck (firetiger) .. cast to where the hammer handle followed and KABOOM! Went the splash and I began to repeat ""big fish, big fish"" as she started to run. It took 100% dedication to the fight to keep her hooked after that. I usually horse and lose all the big pike I hook on bucktails, so I forced myself to baby it and just keep pressure until the fish was exhausted.  Sure enough, quite the epic battle for a summer fish, and soon she was in the net. This is the biggest I've caught in SW ON during the summer months. It may even be the biggest I've hooked. From a pond nonetheless.  It was an experience I put right up with my first topwater musky or catching a trophy through ice. I don't know why but summer pike are such a challenge for me. I'm hooked now though!  I know this may not seem like a big deal to a lot of people who are located near better pike fishing. But down here, to catch a hammer handle or two in a day on these ponds is a really good day.  "
