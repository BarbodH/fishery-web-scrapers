She did it for out of town family that she couldn't go see for pledges but it applies to anyone who wants to donate but can't do so in person!!  Thanks so much for the ongoing support guys - the Fish-a-Thon wouldn't be half of what it is without OFC!  I'm doing this on my phone and am unsure how to embed the video using the phone...    Thanks, Ryan"
