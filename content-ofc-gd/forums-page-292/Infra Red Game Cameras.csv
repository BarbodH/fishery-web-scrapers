799431,Fisherman,2013-07-22 01:28:00,7201,I'm thinking of getting one of the infra red game cameras.  Reason being apparentely humans don't see the flash of the IR LEDS at night.  Some cretin keeps stealing our chopped up wood at the campground and needs to be dealt with.  Any info or help would be appreciated.

799540,Fisherman,2013-07-22 20:33:00,7201,"Okay thanks, maybe I'll have to take a run down to the local hunt shop and see how much of a flash it gives."
799542,misfish,2013-07-22 20:43:00,29133,"You need to talk to detective PI Terry.  Put one of those big mouse traps in the pile Erich. I,ll bet some one will here the cursing."
799584,Fisherman,2013-07-23 00:39:00,7201,"Hahaha, someone else gave me the idea of drilling a couple holes and stuffing them with gunpowder. That should pretty much give away the culprit."
799643,sauce,2013-07-23 05:00:00,219,You want to deter or catch the cretin? A carefully placed water balloon filled with food coloring or some other dye could help with identification. A good deterrent would be obstacles.  Blocked access and General clutter make stealing firewood a more difficult task.
799656,Rich,2013-07-23 09:54:00,3927,What are ya gonna do when you find out it was sasquatch all along?! Lol
799672,Fisherman,2013-07-23 12:39:00,7201,"Well if it's a ""he"" sasquatch, I guess I'll cut some more wood for him,  if it's a ""she"" sasquatchie,  maybe I'll douse the neighbouring camper in some of that AXE aftershave and she can have her ways with him."
799705,DOS,2013-07-23 15:58:00,119,"Just remember, ya get what you pay for.  $130 would be about your minimum for a quality camera, look at Spypoints, U-ways, moultrie's.  Be sure to lock it up as it is just as easy to steal the camera as the wood.  For security, I like to put the camera about 10' up in a tree and aim it down.  The theif most likely won't look up so the IR flash won't be notice.  Also unless he brings a ladder with him, it will be real hard to steal.  I do like the gunpowder in the log idea, LOL  RED"
