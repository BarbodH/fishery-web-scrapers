Thanks to her incedible team @ Sick Kids Hospital Network (Toronto, Boston & Dallas), Credit Valley Hospital and her heroic parents, Leah is an angelic survivor before her 3rd birthday. With a ""Wish"" in the bank redeemable when she turns 5 years old So my daughter calls me a couple of weeks ago and is excited beyond comprehension. ""Leah's been nominated to receive an 'gift' from Million Dollar Smiles. They're coming on Saturday July 20th to install a playhouse in the back yard!!!""Saturday arrived and Mom & Leah had to be offsite for the build so they spent a fun filled morning keeping distracted (thanks to Ta Tia). The team from $1,000,000  :) accompanied by a volunteer crew from Elevation Church bright and early @ 8:30 am. We were told there would be approximately 20 volunteers and my SIL did a head count of 42 @ mid day.The the build was on!!With so many wonderful people volunteerring their time on a beautiful Saturday, the build completion & 'reveal time' was pushed ahead to 1:00 pm vs. 3:30. So after a bit of scrambling and tracking the girls down, it was time for the big reveal......It was a very emotional surprise (yes, Poppa shed a few tears) and Leah was not happy with a yard full of angels, but quickly came around...       At the end of an exciting day, it was time to spend some quiet time with her new baby sister Kiera Grace. To an amazing organization ( www.milliondollarsmiles.ca ) and the volunteers @ Elevation Church, our families heart felt gratitude and blessings go out to you all  :) If your interested to see the full video ( build + reveal), you can see it here. Thx for looking,Simon ps. Sean is doing well, and despite the long road ahead he is getting better and a little stronger every day"

I am ever so thankful for the good people who make these organizations so successful and put a ray of hope and happiness in our lives. 18 years back, it was the Sunshine Foundation that gave my daughter the royal treatment after major life saving surgeries through Shriner's Hospital in Erie.  I am also glad to hear your son is on the road to recovery."
