The real deal is the counter/rigger rod for 60 bucks!  I picked up 2 at that price.  Probably not as good as my sealines, but the price is right!  Sale ends Friday, and they are now out of stock at most locations, but they are giving out rain checks!  Just FYI!"

800101,fishindevil,2013-07-25 17:42:00,6254,The most important thing is how is the drag system ??? If you are lake trout or walleye fishing with it no problems !!! But a 25lb silver king on a mission will melt a lousy drag !!!!
800113,porkpie,2013-07-25 18:56:00,2521,I'll let you know LOL!!  Hopefully they will hold up!
