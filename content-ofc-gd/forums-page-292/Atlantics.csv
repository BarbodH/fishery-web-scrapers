800057,hammercarp,2013-07-25 13:41:00,964,Check this out. Too bad about the one with the snaggers treble stuck in it's gut. I hate snaggers. http://www.livefishcamera.com/sault-ste-marie-mi.html .
800058,BillM,2013-07-25 13:43:00,17367,That's quite the treble!  LOL!
800116,jimmer,2013-07-25 19:10:00,2730,snaggers everywhere!
800132,bare foot wader,2013-07-25 20:22:00,1354,"looks like a treble actually meant for snagging, with a weight on the shaft...at least the fish looks to be in good health regardless...lots of lamprey wounds on them too"
