When the starboard rod goes off again another great fight this time in the net, only to find out it was the same King we just lost, the Celo was still in his mouth, and it had snagged the other lure, Weighed in at 39.6 (3rd Place). Or lose a rod over board on a rough day, while trying to set it in the rigger, then bring the rigger up hear a  strange noise look down and there's the rod snagged on the cable. Some one was smiling on me that day."
