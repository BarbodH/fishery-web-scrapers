799186,Terry,2013-07-20 17:09:00,14456,"still waiting for the back ordered 9.9 kicker but got  the transom saver mounted, misfish made a nice  bracket for it     I needed a base and block for my salty rod holders, thanks misfish, he whipped me up a couple   I got a 22p SS prop for the boat, wow what a difference SS makes, I would tell anyone that has a motor 75hp or more to get one if they have lots of HP for the size of boat you have..if you are underpowered at all don't get one it's all coming together I have the troll master in place and ran to where the motor will be dang I thought the boat was expensive..but it's everything else it needs that's putting a hole in my wallet"
799188,irishfield,2013-07-20 17:31:00,26272,I should have stopped in last night for a hands on inspection.. drove right up Drury last night as I bailed off the 400 onto Canal Road to get home via 11. Send that back to Brian... after marking the salty screw bases. Get him to counter bore a small pocket so if they loosen off they can't slide off.
799189,SlowPoke,2013-07-20 17:38:00,2984,I shudder to think what I've got invested in post-purchase accessories! It's very easy to rack up 10k in accessories. Just be glad you're not paying the dealer inflated prices + labour and financing them! Just do it a little at a time and you won't bleed to death. Looking good!
799191,misfish,2013-07-20 17:46:00,29133,"Yer welcome bud,anytime.  His tab is limited out Wayne.LOL  Good call. I can mill in the pockets next week Terry."
799192,Terry,2013-07-20 17:49:00,14456,thanks guys;  I will have to put your name on one of the seats
799200,SlowPoke,2013-07-20 18:30:00,2984,Wouldn't it be easier to have Brian change his name to Lund Bl...... Nevermind.  I couldn't let that one pass.
799201,Dan668,2013-07-20 18:58:00,1120,What speed and rpm are you getting with that setup?
799204,Terry,2013-07-20 19:33:00,14456,"with he al prop  40mph at 54 with ss  prop   46 at 54 it still just jumps up  on plane, with trim in full plane position it only  takes 3 seconds so I might try a a 24 pitch"
799208,Dan668,2013-07-20 20:01:00,1120,"Good speeds, for some reason i thought the pitch would be too high. Same boat but i have the 115 opti, and i use an aluminum 4 blade quicksilver nemesis but 17 pitch, myself in the boat ill do 46/47 at 5400. With 3 people and loaded 43. Mine planes out really quick compared to the black max and doesnt blow out when steering at high speed.  Your transducer board, is it screwed in?"
799210,Terry,2013-07-20 20:09:00,14456,"no, glued. no holes"
799211,Dan668,2013-07-20 20:16:00,1120,"Hmm what kind of board? I have marine wood, but starboard looks much cleaner, want to swap it out. but from what i have read, the glue isnt a permanent bond with starboard."
799212,Terry,2013-07-20 20:18:00,14456,"It's a nylon that I used, I am checking it every now and then   but it seems to be well stuck"
799214,porkpie,2013-07-20 21:00:00,2521,3M 5300 will keep the plastiboard stuck to a hull for a loooooopooooonnngggg time!  My buddy and I have had it on both our boats for excess of ten years without any movement.  No screws!  It's good stuff!
799215,misfish,2013-07-20 21:13:00,29133,3M has great products. Use many of them in the shop.
799222,Dan668,2013-07-20 21:57:00,1120,"3m 5200 holds my marine plywood solid. With starboard, it will hold but the bond is alot weaker. Dont really want to take the chance. I guess two screws aint so bad."
799615,Moosebunk,2013-07-23 01:56:00,3970,I want this set-up Terry.  That bracket to fit the Lund track is mint.   
799618,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-23 02:07:00,10439,"Terry Trust me when I say it will never be ""done"". I've had my boat for 22 years and I'm still doing stuff to it. I just ordered new rod holders for it and have a nice Bimini top to install. Still have a mini jacker to install and a 9.9 pro kicker and Trollmaster Pro II to pick up.  Break Out Another Thousand"
799625,fishnsled,2013-07-23 02:25:00,3520,"  Oh so true!!!  This year it has been downriggers and putting on a track system for me.  I do like how your track sits Terry, is that some fancy Lund mounting thing to get them mounted like that?"
799695,RangerGuy,2013-07-23 14:14:00,564,Nice add-ons... I have stopped updating my Lund this year haha!  I added a Remote Go-Light on a custom extended Ram mount and a SS prop.  I really like your bracket set up.. I'm gonna have to do that next year
799698,Lunkerhunter,2013-07-23 14:28:00,455,what horsepower do you have on your boat terry? and what pitch is that prop?  sorry to side track your thread but how does one know what pitch to get?
799701,JoshS,2013-07-23 15:29:00,729,Looks awesome! I like that track setup.
799711,Terry,2013-07-23 16:30:00,14456,Hp is 125. Pitch is 22The track is the one I talked about. In an other thread tectrax or something. I will check when I get home. Too hard with the crackberry.  this is my tracks  http://www.traxstech.com/T-Bolt_Bracket.html
