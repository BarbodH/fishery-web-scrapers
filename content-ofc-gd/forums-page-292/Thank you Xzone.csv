799957,Rich,2013-07-24 22:17:00,3927,Love their monster rib worms
799963,misfish,2013-07-24 22:32:00,29133,"  Well said Craig.  Mark was one of the first guys I met doing the CFT Pro/Am. Always willing to give advice.  I can say this,his head never got to big for his shoulders. Thats the kinda guy he is."
799646,mike rousseau,2013-07-23 06:36:00,4661,Just got my order from Xzone today (that I pay full price for before anyone starts assuming I'm spamming...lol).... Opened it up to find a color I didn't order... And after a long poopy night at work I was quick to assume my order was messed up... But no... They sent me an extra pack of a different color to try on the house... I just think that's great... And it made up for about half my shipping costs...  So thank you Xzone.... So far between the results using Xzone slammers and this complimentary gift... I'll be making an effort to substitute in their baits wherever possible in my arsenal... I have no problem supporting good businesses like this...  Quality product and good service/gesture... Nice to see that with a Canadian company...  Mike   ...
799647,Stoty,2013-07-23 08:33:00,2910,"Xzone not only has the best (and most successful) soft plastics around, but also a first class guy in Mark running the company. For anyone that hasn't tried Xzone baits yet, your def missing out! Pick up a pack...or twelve..and give them a shot. You won't be disappointed!"
799675,Dave Bailey,2013-07-23 13:00:00,1641,"Ditto to all the above. In the interest of disclosure, Mark provided me with prizes for the Gals 'n' Pals tournament, but I would say the same thing anyway."
799684,misfish,2013-07-23 13:42:00,29133,"Yup,one of the nicest guys you will ever meet."
799694,Steve Piggott,2013-07-23 14:13:00,196,"Slammers have caught 80% of the fish in my boat the last three years .Good  guy , great product ."
799712,BillM,2013-07-23 16:43:00,17367,Wouldn't be caught without some Swammers if I'm laker fishing.
799718,MJL,2013-07-23 17:14:00,2427," x2   I haven’t hooked anything on the Slammers yet, but they look too good not to get eaten by something.  Anyone know if we can buy X-zone products, loose without the packaging, in bulk? I don’t care for the packaging and I especially hate just throwing it away for 4-6 lures."
799721,misfish,2013-07-23 17:32:00,29133,Go to Marks site and send him a message. I wouldn't be surprised if he could do that for you.  http://w.xzonelures.com/
799738,JoshS,2013-07-23 19:38:00,729,"I think they have the best swimbait action out there. Killer for walleye at night, bass (especially fall smallies), lakers, browns inhale it, pike.  I've requested them in bulk and can be done but the tails tend to kink up in the big bag."
799766,BillM,2013-07-23 22:00:00,17367,"I used them last week up in northwestern Ontario for some lakers, even they love them!  lol"
799780,lookinforwalleye,2013-07-23 23:18:00,4399,Hmmm maybe I should try the bags I bought a couple years ago!!!
799781,bobogo,2013-07-23 23:33:00,76,anyone know any stores that carry them in GTA?  *edit* nvm! saw their dealer page on their website
799783,BFSC Kevin,2013-07-23 23:35:00,1351,Sail does
799785,Drew_10,2013-07-23 23:45:00,111," Send Mark an email, he can probably hook you up. [email protected]  Hands down the best dropshot baits on the market.  Every single bait is individually poured and packaged by hand."
799822,Stoty,2013-07-24 04:03:00,2910, [email protected]
799844,MSBruno,2013-07-24 13:02:00,369,BPS and Sail both carry XZone products
799846,jimca11,2013-07-24 13:20:00,34,Does anyone use the drop shot hooks? they look good.
799850,musky_hunter,2013-07-24 13:43:00,328,Low the swammer....
799851,Ainsley,2013-07-24 13:45:00,142,"I have yet to use my pack of green swammers, might have to try em next time I'm out."
799852,BillM,2013-07-24 13:52:00,17367,Going to have to look into some of those leeches.
799865,misfish,2013-07-24 15:19:00,29133,Steve Rowbotham  couldn't keep the lakers off of them. Huge fish.
799885,mercman,2013-07-24 16:51:00,7054,They make great trailers for spinnerbaits too.
799891,mike rousseau,2013-07-24 17:07:00,4661,If you referring to the ones with a built in swivel... Yes...  Love em... Don't need to tie a special knot... Anyone can rig em...  Gives more action to the bait...  Reduces line twist....  I'm using the VMC spinshot hooks in 1/O...
799923,craigdritchie,2013-07-24 19:11:00,1586,"I've been friends with Mark for more than 30 years. He makes a great product, and there really isn't a nicer guy in the business. It's awesome to see a great guy like that have so much success ... he truly deserves it."
799943,Stoty,2013-07-24 20:28:00,2910, Absolutely! I don't use anything but them. Awesome hooks!  For smallies I typically use the Size 2 ones.
