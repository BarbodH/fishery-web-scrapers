Anyways, on my way back I check I stop by a bridge over-crossing the lake I fished, to see what was happening. On the way down to the bridge I see something in the bushes, which actually turns out to be two discarded bows with the fillets taken off. This didn't make sense since rainbows are not native to this fishery, also that the bows were actually steelhead looking to be pushing 7-8 pounds. This seemed very weird to me why they would even be there in the first place considering this area was at least an hour from every great lake."
