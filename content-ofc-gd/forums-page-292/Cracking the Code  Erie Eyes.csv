799558,krixxer,2013-07-22 23:12:00,274,Last weekend I got up a bit early. I drove a bit faster. I made my coffee stronger! I was determined!          and I was rewarded I started targeting them late last year and after several no fish trips I got lazy and started fishing bass and perch.  After this last trip I'm not sure if I'll be cleaning many perch anytime soon.

The new Big John rigger is the the second, this was the first time I used it. I know I still have to tune my technique, I think I should have been a bit further off the bottom. I was 45 deep in 50 FOW with 20 feet of line behind the boat. For the day I got 3 eyes  22,23 and a 25 inch a bunch of sheep and a few silver bass.  I never changed my bait all day, used a perch/gold worm rig on 5 feet of leader."
