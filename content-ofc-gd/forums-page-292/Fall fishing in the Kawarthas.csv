Given new work restraints we can't fish Sturgeon Lake this year until the October 4th weekend.  Welcoming any feedback on fishing anywhere in the Kawarthas that time of year as well as any suggestions on fishing cottages for 8-10 men.  Thanks in advance,  ""DR"" Dave  ."
799808,Hank Jr,2013-07-24 01:51:00,146,Hi Dave My son and I have been fishing Sturgeon for a lot of years and have fished it from June -Oct . We fish for Muskies and now make most of our trips in Oct . You will find a lot less boat traffic and we have been doing a lot better on bigger fish in Oct . If you want more info send me a PM I can help you some.  Tight Lines Hank Jr
799863,Beans,2013-07-24 15:13:00,3339,Fall is my favorite time of year to fish up here...the fish are putting on the feed-bag for winter and the skeeters are gone...

799946,jimmer,2013-07-24 20:44:00,2730,Fall fishing can be a challenge. The water clears up and the weeds start dying. Muskie are your best bet from what I hear from the guys fishing Sturgeon. I always struggle at that time of year since the zebra mussels moved in. I guess I just haven't caught onto the newer approaches. LOL Night time for walleye!
