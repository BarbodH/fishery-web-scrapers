799358,misfish,2013-07-21 18:28:00,29133,"Was walking along and all of a sudden,this guy came slithering by.   "
799360,Joeytier,2013-07-21 18:30:00,3990,Is that not a massasauga rattler?
799361,davey buoy,2013-07-21 18:34:00,5505,"No rattle that I can see. They see you before you see them,I'm sure he would of heard a rattle if that was the case.Interested to know as well."
799363,fishnsled,2013-07-21 18:36:00,3520,Rat snake?
799364,Fisherman,2013-07-21 18:38:00,7201,"Common Fox snake, see here.  If you get up close you'll see it has a round pupil, non venemous. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_snake"
799366,farsider,2013-07-21 18:46:00,456,"I would have guessed Milk Snake but, it is hard to tell by that picture.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_snake  Cheers, Mark"
799368,misfish,2013-07-21 18:47:00,29133,"No rattle. Yes Erich,it had a round pupil. .I got close to is,but  NOT to close. LOL Seen it not to far from your town.    Thats what my wife said as well."
799369,wallacio,2013-07-21 18:55:00,475,Milk Snake.   Seem to be a lot around this year.
799374,Big Cliff,2013-07-21 19:29:00,6899,"Milk, Rat, and Massasauga are all very close in appearance. Just because it didn't have rattles doesn't mean it isn't one. Better to err on the side of safe. A Massasauga won't likely kill you but it could make you quite sick and if bitten you should seek medical attention ASAP. I do know of one woman who died from a Massasauga bite in French River several years ago. She thought it was just a rat snake that bit her. She died a few days later."
799381,ehg,2013-07-21 19:52:00,2666,It is a fox snake. Not that commonly seen.
799434,Rizzo,2013-07-22 01:50:00,4754,whatever it is its pretty big for southern Ontario
799435,4thgen,2013-07-22 01:53:00,157,"It is definitely an Eastern Milksnake. The markings on both Fox Snakes and Massasaugas are quite different from the cream background with reddish brown blotches shown in your picture. Also, assuming that this was somewhere fairly close to Barrie, neither of the other two species occur there."
799436,Jon,2013-07-22 01:55:00,209,Cool find? Where did you see it (approximately)? Rat snakes have a pretty limited distribution in Ontario and Milk Snakes are pretty widespread.  http://www.ontarionature.org/protect/species/reptiles_and_amphibians/eastern_foxsnake.php http://www.ontarionature.org/protect/species/reptiles_and_amphibians/milksnake.php  Pretty sure it is a Milk Snake. I will ask some people at the office tomorrow.  Jon
799451,singingdog,2013-07-22 10:26:00,1047,"It's a milk snake. The brown blotches, outlined in black, differentiate it from a fox snake. If it were a fox snake, the brown blotches would not have a black outline."
799523,jedimaster,2013-07-22 19:24:00,3472,milk snakes. I used to see lots of them while hiking on some Bruce Trails. They aren't poisoness but can be very aggressive and can still give you a nasty bite.
799588,hooked!,2013-07-23 00:44:00,38,"How long was it? From the photo it looks like it was about five feet long.  If so, most likely a fox snake.  Where did you see it?"
799602,highdrifter,2013-07-23 01:38:00,2534,MILK SNAKE.  Looks to be about 3ft long.  Am I right?
799788,ehg,2013-07-24 00:17:00,2666,"After looking at those links it is obviously a milk snake. So milk snake it is, Cool find!"
799835,misfish,2013-07-24 10:48:00,29133,2ft long a bit more.
799861,jimmer,2013-07-24 14:41:00,2730,Milk snake and they like to bite.
