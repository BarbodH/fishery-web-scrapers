799847,mistaredone,2013-07-24 13:28:00,913,Any recommendations for a skeg repair guy in the GTA?  I shredded a prop and broke off the bottom of the skeg as a good bye present from Gbay lol.  The skeg is aluminum?  Not sure if they are made with anything else?  Thanks  Steve

Kings on Muskoka rd 5 on the way to HH is another good place. Calvin has been at it his whole life and is pretty good as well.
