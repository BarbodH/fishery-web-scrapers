799803,captpierre,2013-07-24 01:42:00,2521,Just a plug for a member that seviced my 2 Abu C3's.  They squeeled like crazy casting my muskie baits.  Found Ah_long on this site.  He is in Markham.  Tried the reels this weekend.  They are sparkling clean  and perform like new.  Nice guy and fair price  Peter
799862,FrankTheRabbit,2013-07-24 14:57:00,479,I second Ah_long's reel service. I just hope he never moves from the Markham area!
799881,maybo,2013-07-24 16:33:00,86,how much does he charge?
799925,FrankTheRabbit,2013-07-24 19:17:00,479,"It's been a while since I've last seen him, so better to contact him directly. He doesn't bite."
799961,ah_long,2013-07-24 22:31:00,354,Thanks for your kind words Peter. It was a pleasure working on those reels of yours!
800017,captpierre,2013-07-25 03:09:00,2521,He charged $25 per reel.  No parts needed
