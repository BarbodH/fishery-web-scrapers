799970,Raycaster,2013-07-24 22:59:00,528,Finally got an ok from friends for a quick fishing trip on Buckhorn Aug 5-6 and looking for accommodations. Just need 1 night and boat slip and was hoping for suggestions. Check Three Castles and they are booked solid.  I can always find a spot in Fenelon Falls but was hoping for an easy launch to Lower Buckhorn etc.  Any suggestions welcome.

Nice cabins with a great ramp and your right at the west end of the lake.  Somebody will chime in with the name unless I can get my old brain working."
799985,Kawartha Kev,2013-07-25 00:17:00,281,The resort is Sunrise if you are thinking of the resort on Lower Buckhorn Lew. They do have a ramp and you could go through the locks if you wanted to fish Upper Buckhorn.  kawarhta Kev
799986,porkpie,2013-07-25 00:17:00,2521,"Check the resort on Deer bay.  I always go to 3 Castles, and they are fantastic, but the resort on Deer bay usually have some last minute availabilty.  Sorry, name escapes me."
