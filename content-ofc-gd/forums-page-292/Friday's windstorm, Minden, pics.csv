799498,ccmtcanada,2013-07-22 17:27:00,7971,Time to fix the date on the camera! LOL.  Wow...the trees that came down there are unreal!  I hope no one was in the cottage or was hurt when the storm blew through!  Nice fish by the way!
799499,lew,2013-07-22 17:31:00,12766,"WOW, that's lousy luck, sure hope they get everything fixed up fast."
799508,fishnsled,2013-07-22 18:08:00,3520,"That's crazy!  I too hope things are back to normal soon for everyone up there.  Couple of nice fish though.    Smartass, that's something I would say.  lol!"
799521,solopaddler,2013-07-22 19:19:00,8605,Wow tough break Chris!  Don't you guys leave for Nakina soon?
799522,Sinker,2013-07-22 19:20:00,8692,"I'd say that calls for a massive bonfire! As long as nobody was hurt, it could have been worse I suppose.  S."
799740,chris.brock,2013-07-23 19:41:00,4053,"  yeah, everytime I take the battery out of the camera to charge it, the date needs to be reset   we cancelled, I threw my back out the day before we were supposed to leave, I'm pretty useless now, I'm also disappointed we didn't get to Muskrat"
799768,HTHM,2013-07-23 22:05:00,4082,"According to Mike Borger, thats no big deal, only a couple of petunias blown the opposite of lean."
799774,solopaddler,2013-07-23 22:55:00,8605," Really sorry to hear that Chris. I can relate, I threw my back out two weeks before the Attawapiskat trip, but it healed in time. Did you ever end up working something out with Martin?    It's a heavy wind gust Albert, not a tornado LOL!  A bit touchy don't you think?"
