799564,Christopheraaron,2013-07-22 23:30:00,3525,"Today I was fishing some really shallow, gin clear water (about 1ft) and I spotted what was probably almost a 40"" pike, I casted a white tube to it and twitched it past the fish a couple times but it got annoyed and swam off. My first mistake was using a wire leader which I'm sure he saw, but I was wondering if there was something else (besides a fly) that I would have been able to try to get him?"
799566,krixxer,2013-07-22 23:34:00,274,a rock
799567,Terry,2013-07-22 23:37:00,14456,either let it sit for a long time or burn a fast moving bait past it
799568,krixxer,2013-07-22 23:42:00,274,sure; that would be the more educated answer
799570,Acountdeleted,2013-07-22 23:49:00,2562,"Its all a guess, I would have tore a spoon across the surface."
799571,DRIFTER_016,2013-07-22 23:52:00,10439,I would have tossed a fly at it.
799576,Musky or Specks,2013-07-23 00:17:00,2710,Floro leaders to start. Quick strike rigged sucker. (Cuz I know you had one handy) With those options exhausted I'd go real small to try the dinner mint theory(I'm full but I'll still try an after dinner mint)It will still probably ignore it but atleast you've got a nice anecdote about pike fishing now.
799577,Christopheraaron,2013-07-23 00:18:00,3525,"Lol drifter, so would I but my rod is broken for now"
799578,sauce,2013-07-23 00:18:00,219,"Unweighted soft plastic. 4"" power minnow or gulp!  Pitch it way past your sighted pike and work it back to your fish super slow. If you can get the fish to turn and look at your bait before it gets close, you can trigger the strike with a really small movement.  If he doesnt turn and look on that first retrieve, same bait but try from a different casting position. Remember to work it real slow.... let it sit on bottom."
799590,solopaddler,2013-07-23 01:02:00,8605,"I've fished pike many times over the years in clear skinny water and they can be frustrating. My go-to technique, stumbled upon by accident, is a 3 or 4"" black Berkley Power Leech on a light jighead. Light line and no leader either. Most times these fish are hooked in the corner of the mouth.  It just seems like they can't refuse it, the angling equivalent of an after dinner mint."
799593,Christopheraaron,2013-07-23 01:06:00,3525,"Figures, had that I'm my bag today Mike, lol. Some great ideas guys, keep 'me coming!"
799598,Gregoire,2013-07-23 01:29:00,1397,Suspending minnow.Load it up with scent and slowly retrieve it until it is in front of its nose. Then just leave it there. The Pike equivalent of the deadstick.
799601,Moosebunk,2013-07-23 01:35:00,3970,"  You said besides a fly... and that their lost it.  It is sooo amazing how sunning pike will ignore EVERYTHING, but if you have a rabbit-strip fly that you can leave sit in front of it's face, it will hit it twice. lol."
799620,dhickey,2013-07-23 02:10:00,1038,You have 2 new lures coming your way. As for the sunning pike or musky its generally a good sine.(the feed is on) But sometimes it doesn't matter what you put in front of them in July and early August. They just get so lazy and finicky that it drives me nuts.  1ft of water is to shallow to throw a minnow at  and anything with weight is pointless so your left with a long shot cast on lite line or trying top water casted past and worked slowly into the strike range.
799633,manitoubass2,2013-07-23 03:13:00,11391,"I agree with mike. Another one I'd add is a Texas rigged chigger craw, frigging pike just love those, seriousy"

799663,BillM,2013-07-23 11:37:00,17367,"Pike aren't very picky, I doubt your leader had anything to do with it.   He wasn't hungry and that was about it."
799673,Dave Bailey,2013-07-23 12:58:00,1641," Agreed, I've never really bought into the idea that seeing a line or a leader will scare a fish. If it did, I think the sight of a bunch of really mean looking hooks would spook them more."
799674,woodenboater,2013-07-23 13:00:00,2277,go back with a fly rod and strip a big fat wooly bugger past it
799689,Stoty,2013-07-23 14:01:00,2910,Marshmallow....................
799690,NAW,2013-07-23 14:04:00,4022,Top water.  just for excitement of it!  That would have been great to see!
799693,highdrifter,2013-07-23 14:13:00,2534,"She may have had a big white sucker in her gut and was trying to speed up her metabolism...  In that case, it wouldn't have mattered what you threw at her.   I'm thinking if you saw her she most likely would have made you..  Spooked or not, she was not going to eat.  If she was in the shallows but in ambush mode, a subtle twitch with a low profile bait like a bunny leech or soft plastic swim bait might have done the trick.  cheers HD"
799702,JoshS,2013-07-23 15:37:00,729,Tough one. I'd throw a 4in natural coloured jerkbait on 20lb fluoro. Or some kind of very subtle plastic you can tantalize them with. What's that pike doing in a foot of water in the summer? My guess would be she's messed up and not into eating anything.
799745,jimmer,2013-07-23 19:55:00,2730,"I had that happen a couple of times and nothing worked, so I just enjoyed the sight of a monster pike. I don't think leaders bother them that much, you probably bother it more. LOL"
799747,Rich,2013-07-23 20:06:00,3927,"YUP  Though, on some days, I've seen those shallow lock jawed pricks hit a scum frog..... And bite it off."
