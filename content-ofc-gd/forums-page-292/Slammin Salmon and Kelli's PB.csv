Early fall, I'd spend some time in the rivers getting salmon, and seeing some of what I saw on the rivers in the fall, really turned me off of it. I'd always wanted my fiancee, Kelli to feel the pull of a salmon. When fellow Imperium Baits pro staffer, Greg Amiel called and asked if I'd be interested in getting down to Lake O for some ""real"" fresh salmon, I couldnt pass on it, and Kelli tagged along. Watching Greg, a respected guide do his work was like learning a foreign language. Greg worked very hard to get us on fish. on a day that it seemed most were struggling. I cant recall exactly, but I think we went about 8 for 12 and were off the water by noon. We landed some really quality fish out there, and some little guys too. The best part of the day, and probably my season so far, was the final hookup of the day. It was Kelli's turn and when the rod went off, she jumped to it and we immediately knew she was into a good one. After about 10 minutes and a wicked arm workout, Greg put the net around her biggest fish to date. After a few woooos, holys and yeahs, we were speeding off to the nearest weigh station. Her fish tipped the scales at 32.74 lbs she placed 5th on Week 2 of the Salmon Derby! We're all very excited, and very thankful to Greg of Fishing4Tails charters for showing us a great day on the water!         "

Pulled a 15 hour day... Went 16 for 21 I think... Plenty of fish over 20lbs and a 28 and change that we decided to weigh...  And your right... Fishing with Greg  you'll learn a lot.... He's the one that opened my eyes to how to really use my sonar/GPS...  Still waiting for him to come back down for musky.... I owe him a trip....
