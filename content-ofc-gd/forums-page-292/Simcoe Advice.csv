Don't know tha lake at all from a launch, boating or fishing standpoint and would be looking for some advice. We could launch anywhere on the west side but directions are what I am looking for! Also, a spot to launch close to pike and bass is perfect. Not looking for a honey hole or anything, just some basic advice.  Thanks,  Chris  P.S. I know there are a ton of othe lakes that way too and would consider any of those as well."

There is good fishing to be had nearby both access points.  For pike and largemouth, look for deep weeds in the 10-15 foot range.  For smallmouth, fish the shoals or islands in the area.  Sand and rocks are key to finding them."
