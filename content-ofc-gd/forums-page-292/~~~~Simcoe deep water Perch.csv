Launched at Sibs lots of room, still seems like some people don't know how to park, or launch, all want to launch next to the docks, then tie up and walk away leaving their boat there. we headed out up the west side of Georgina, spotted our scouts showing us where the bait phish were, in 43'  of water, and had the first Jumbo Perch in the well right off the bat, and ever have one of those daze where you get the first phish as soon as you set up then Nada. We decided to move in shallower, to 39', and came a cross some more of our scouts sitting in on large area, watched the screen and marked some massive schools, so we lowered the anchor, and started again and it was great phishen spotted bait phish all over the place with hooks diving in and out of them, brought our lines up high and wham some major hits only to phind some great looken Herring on out lures (DRAT). Ended the Day about 2:30 with 6 nice Jumbos releasing a lot of dinks as usual, and 5 Herring(Released)"
