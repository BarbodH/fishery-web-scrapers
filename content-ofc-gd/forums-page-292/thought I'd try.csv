After a couple days of shaping, carving, sealing, and painting this guy was finished (apart from hooks), I think it looks alright, apart from being a little rough in some spots with the paint. Does any one have suggestions on how to improve it?  "
800163,tender52,2013-07-25 23:51:00,270,Different color for sure. Nice twist on a jail bird. Put some 8/0 on it and start trolling
800164,Christopheraaron,2013-07-26 00:22:00,3525,"Just tried it in the pool, originally it was supposed to be a walk the dog lure but because it isn't perfectly round (I guess  ) it doesn't run right, so I'm going to try trolling it instead."
800165,ketchenany,2013-07-26 00:32:00,3229,Good work! If nothing else it repels 'skunks'
800184,tender52,2013-07-26 03:18:00,270,Did you want to make it a top water? You might want to add some weight to it. just a piece of wood ( plastic / whatever) wont do much without some resistance. Not being round will add some difficulty. Keep fine tuneing.
800185,Christopheraaron,2013-07-26 03:34:00,3525,"It's internally weighted but I didn't put enough in so I threw a bell sinker on the back and it's a little better. I'm going to try again, hopefully it'll work a little better."
