A buddy has the Frog Toggs suit and I was surprised how well it held up on the trip with the rains we had.  Not sure about the long term use as it was brand new at the time.

Presently I use a Wetskins X-Treme suit that I picked up a Costco for around $50-60.  For the price its great but I looked at the 100MPH and they are way heavy duty.  Burt
846753,mike rousseau,2014-04-09 21:39:00,4661,I had a guidewear suit and loved it...  Lost the jacket but luckily another member gave me a mint almost new 100mph jacket...  I like the 100mph jacket better... I hated the pockets on the guidewear... To many baggy pockets...  So now I'm rocken guidewear bibs and 100mph jacket...  All kept me dry... All were well made... It's more of personal preference of design
846788,aplumma,2014-04-09 23:17:00,6896,I forgot my rainsuit and borrowed a buddy of mines and we fished in one heck of a rain/wind storm. The suit was one of the old style Gortons fisherman suit all rubber and I was bone dry till the sun came out and the humidity hit us. I was sweating in 10 minutes. So when it is an overcast day and raining enough to keep me cool I bring out the all rubber suit. Otherwise it is a goretex motorcycle suit.   Art

Burt I was looking at those tonite and did not grab one. I was going to ask if anyone had tried them out? I have a BPS pro Q bibs and a Columbia coat right now. Wasn't sure if  I should grab a bps  pq coat. The costco coat and pants made me wonder if that would be the way to go for a proper rain coat.
846815,chris.brock,2014-04-10 01:24:00,4053,"The Costco Wetskins suit is what I have, it's fairly heavy, breathes pretty well, the price is decent, but if it's raining pretty good, in time, the water soaks through,  I don't want to spend $300 plus and find out it's similar to the Wetskins gear  I'm still leaning towards Art's opinion, rubber when it's pouring, Wetskins when it's warm and light rain"

Like you I just worry about its breathability. But maybe it's the old Frogg Toggs when it's light and that when it's heavy.. Will update"
846840,solopaddler,2014-04-10 02:26:00,8605,"I've worn pretty much everything over the years.  Best suit I ever had was a goretex one made by Fenwick, it lasted over 10 years and was bombproof.  Cabelas and Bass Pro are both good, but if forced to choose I'd have to give the nod to Bass Pro rainwear.  The best value imo is the Pro Qualifier suit from Bass Pro. I like the fit better than the 100mph suit and they're pretty much bulletproof. Cheaper too, especially if you get the suit on sale.  I'm wearing a Simms jacket and bibs now. Fantastic fit and finish but time will tell if stands up."
846845,Steve,2014-04-10 02:44:00,2075,"my buddy had the 100mph, then took it back for the pro qualifier.  take both of them, one in each hand, and CAREFULLY look over them and compare.  you will notice the pro qualifier is better in virtually every way."
846846,Squid,2014-04-10 02:46:00,1656,"In my honest opinion if you are looking for a rainsuit and want a deal then wait until the Cabelas opens up in Buffalo this summer and by the Cabela's rainsuit in September for 50% to 60 % off. I paid 202 US dollars for mine last September instead of 450 us dollars, it was a great a great deal and I see the same deal year over year. The price in Cabelas Barrie will probably be around 550 for the same suit."

Thats what alot of the reviews said also , and led me to the PQ bibs.  I hate getting my ""junk"" wet every fall while atv'n to moose camp. also the biggest difference apparently in the 100mph to the Pro Q is the PQ is much easier to P out of. The front zipper is longer or something? I ordered mine online and had to go by the reviews, so i have no first hand experience.  no rain test yet for my bibs but they do cut the winter winds nice.   The cabela suit sounds  sweet at that 50-60% off price in the u.s. also"

Previous have had Frogg Toggs, I like them (light and breathable) but they don't hold up as well as I would like in heavy downpours or in extened (2 hours plus) rain. I was wondering what you guys prefered in terms of rainwear for your fishing season. Who makes the best raingear for fishing? "

846489,ccmtcanada,2014-04-08 18:31:00,7971,I used to cheap out on rainsuits....then I puchased a guide series (Goretex) jacket from Cabelas.  The jacket works great but I still had cheap pants and was soaked the last time I fished in the rain.  I finally bit the bullet and bought the matching bibs from Cabelas.

So much so that I find myself wearing it more than any other rain gear. Breathes really good, keeps me dry, and tough.  The cabela's gear is certainly drier, but I wrecked a set pretty quick.  S."

846645,Lape0019,2014-04-09 12:16:00,647,"  I bought a 100MPH rainsuit after using every other cheaper version and for something that keeps you bone dry, it is pretty breathable. More so than anything else I had tried. For the price of it, it is hard to find a better gore-tex rainsuit. I was really looking at the Simms suit before I bought this but I could not justify double the price for something that was going to keep me just as dry."
846659,'Kota'sDad,2014-04-09 14:01:00,7,Any of the Cabelas GoreTex lines. Buy one size larger than normal so you can layer under it as necessary. Do not skimp on top quality rain gear if you're outside more than just running from the house to the car. Good rain gear is worth any six St. Croix rods bundled together!
