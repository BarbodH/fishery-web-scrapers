846219,farsider,2014-04-07 15:46:00,456,"Beauty fish Rich!  It is time for reflection when the girls whiskers scratch your chin.  Cheers, Mark"

846262,fishnsled,2014-04-07 19:35:00,3520,Beauty fish Rich!  Maybe a little music to help set the mood for you.   
846273,misfish,2014-04-07 20:12:00,29133,Thats a real nice clean fish Rich.  You always seem to bring the best out of those big girls.
846277,davey buoy,2014-04-07 20:13:00,5505,"Thats a real nice clean fish Rich.  You always seem to bring the best out of those big girls. Do we even know it's a girl ??????????just sayin, lmao  ."
846671,LeXXington,2014-04-09 15:06:00,1928,"Wow, nice fish"
846673,outllaw,2014-04-09 15:10:00,1232,nice fish congrats
846681,highdrifter,2014-04-09 15:57:00,2534,Dude you need some poontang..  That fish could not defend itself!!
846079,Rich,2014-04-06 23:45:00,3927,"...of a carp. Second fish of the season.. I got enough flack for posting the weight on FB from naysayers so I won't post it again. It was weighed on a digital scale and I'll say it was probably the 5th biggest I've ever caught. Canned corn, nothing fancy, not even a hair rig and I didn't even bring the baitrunner. It was a horeshoe in the arse fish for sure but I'll take it! Bring on spring!!!!  "
846083,Roy,2014-04-06 23:55:00,13728,"That's disgusting! Poor carp....  Big clean looking fish, Rich. Congratulations!"
846084,EME411,2014-04-07 00:03:00,13,Get a room.  Big hog for sure.
846085,mike rousseau,2014-04-07 00:07:00,4661,That's a pig...  Wish you'd post the weight tho... Most guys here don't care enough about carp to hastle you...  Can you PM it to me... ?
846089,Musky or Specks,2014-04-07 00:17:00,2710,Hey are the ponds down there opening up would like to go gill fishing. By the way that carp was disappointed there wasn't more tongue
846090,spincast,2014-04-07 00:18:00,3279,wow. Nice fish
846092,Roy,2014-04-07 00:23:00,13728,Get a room.  Start with dinner and a few drinks at least.
846093,shane,2014-04-07 00:24:00,652,lol I'll keep an eye out for the game warden if you two would like to be alone.
846094,BillM,2014-04-07 00:25:00,17367,I'm calling P3TA!  LOL!  That's cow Rich!
846099,captpierre,2014-04-07 00:41:00,2521,Was she into it?
846100,Rich,2014-04-07 00:41:00,3927,"Lmao, some hilarious comments guys! Thanks everyone.  Still probably a week to go for fully open water out here. That being said, there are open spots with gills that aren't too hard to find.  "
846101,Gallie,2014-04-07 00:41:00,1215,"Awesome fish, i just tried the holland today but no luck. I would like to know the weight, id say it might be 30+ from what i can see. I cant wait till the ice is off and i can fish in my canal for them again!"
846108,moxie,2014-04-07 01:15:00,1566,Sweet fish!! Post the weight. Who cares what anyone says.
846109,Rich,2014-04-07 01:22:00,3927,"Alllllright, even i'll admit i probably wouldn't believe it just seeing the pics, but I had two witnesses there when she went on the scale... 38 lbs! -1 for the net I suppose. So 37.  And hey if anyone wants to debate it well you wouldn't be the first to open that can of worms. Lol"
846113,Gallie,2014-04-07 01:27:00,1215,"Beautiful, i think the ontario record is only 40 lbs so im guessing you have beat it before. Carp is one of those fish that definitely have a breakable record. I wouldnt debate it, that fish looks like a tank, i got a 20 lb fatty in my backyard last year that was about half that size so id say you are good"
846114,mike rousseau,2014-04-07 01:31:00,4661,The Ontario carp record has been broken before and shattered by some...  But believe it or not most carp anglers are more protective of carp then muskies guys are with lunge... So the idea of killing a fish for a record... You'd be shunned from the angling community forever...
846115,Fisherpete,2014-04-07 01:33:00,1814,"Beauty Rich! I was out for them myself today for a few hours, saw a few but they were very sluggish. I don't doubt the weight at all, there are 40's out there and probably even 50's... I have seen some giants in Lake Ontario."
846117,Freshtrax,2014-04-07 01:37:00,2215,Pretty sure I saw some 60 lb cows hangin in some slack water just south of devils hole on the niagara once .   Need a marlin rig if one of them ever got into the current.
846118,Gallie,2014-04-07 01:38:00,1215,I cant imagine killing a record fish just for a record. I really wish they would revise the criteria so records could be released. Although a lot of guys would release them anyways it would be nice if they got the recognition they deserve ( if they want it)
846120,bushart,2014-04-07 01:41:00,2628,Nice Rich  But at 38 lbs and if you guys are gonna have a life together I may suggest the Atkins diet for her
846123,chris.brock,2014-04-07 01:46:00,4053,"yes there is,  here's a picture of an already crappy picture, I'm 6'2"", this carp from Hamilton Harbour bottomed out a 50 lbs spring scale    I think you would be ok posting the weight on here, if not, who really cares?"
846135,manitoubass2,2014-04-07 02:11:00,11391,"I dont see why anyone would doubt the weight??? Look at its head, its bigger then yours, so if anyone is gloating its the fish lol. Awesome catch dood, I'd be pumped catching that hog"
846137,chris.brock,2014-04-07 02:16:00,4053,"I didn't mean to hijack the thread, that's one giant fish there Rich, I like your passion for fishing"
846153,davey buoy,2014-04-07 07:10:00,5505,Awesome fish Rich.Good to see some open water fishing starting up!!!
846168,craigdritchie,2014-04-07 12:01:00,1586,Sorry Rich but I'm bored out of my skull this morning. Nice fish bro!
