846745,Christopheraaron,2014-04-09 21:10:00,3525,"Today's image.    Can't figure out what that big body is south of simcoe, did the holland flood?"
846746,kickingfrog,2014-04-09 21:12:00,8333,Black soil.
846794,misfish,2014-04-09 23:38:00,29133,I like the videos too  And at his own fuel cost.  Thanks again Wayne for the  fly bye/over vids.
846795,irishfield,2014-04-09 23:41:00,26272,Fuel cost... just better than being in the shop! lol  Got a bunch of still shots as well.. just need to downsize them.
846923,jedimaster,2014-04-10 14:00:00,3472,"Can't figure out what that big body is south of simcoe, did the holland flood? That's Misty's isn't it?"
846927,BillM,2014-04-10 14:02:00,17367,"Can't figure out what that big body is south of simcoe, did the holland flood?  That's what black dirt looks like from space."
846937,jedimaster,2014-04-10 14:16:00,3472,"Algonquin ice out watch is saying they are down to 34 cm's of snow as of yesterday. This is the same snow level as last year two weeks later. Ice out was April 30th last year... If we are 2 weeks late that would push it into the second week of may. May 5th  in '05, May 10th in '96, May 12th in '02, May 15th in '72 is the record for lat ice out.  Its going to be an interesting spring."
846939,Sinker,2014-04-10 14:21:00,8692,"I can't recall ever icefishing in may, but this might be the year for it.  Two years ago I had the boat out in feb....that was a new one for me too.  Crazy weather.  S."
847054,davey buoy,2014-04-10 19:51:00,5505,"Could even be May 12 ,one weekend gone lol.Who really knows."
847083,Bernie,2014-04-10 21:24:00,3190,"I figure 2 weeks and two days and Fish bay will be open on Nipissing.Week later and Hunters bay is open.The South River has started to thaw in places, some open water."
847087,kickingfrog,2014-04-10 21:28:00,8333,Greening's bay (just a few bays up from you Bernie) at the bottom end was showing signs of opening soon on Sunday. There was a flock of geese there and I swear they were jumping on the ice trying to break it open.
847088,misfish,2014-04-10 21:42:00,29133,"I figure 2 weeks and two days and Fish bay will be open on Nipissing. Week later and Hunters bay is open. The South River has started to thaw in places, some open water.   And to think,we were driving the ice road not so long ago.  I thought Nip would be til end of May for sure Bernie. Crazy ice thickness out there. Or is that normal up there?"
847097,Bernie,2014-04-10 22:29:00,3190,Drove my pickup across last Sunday Brian.Don't think I will even go with my ATV this weekend.Going to wait for the boat now.
847101,SirCranksalot,2014-04-10 22:38:00,3291,Gbay ice has turned blue/black---looks like candle ice which will break easily with the waves. probably gone by Mon.
847175,Musky or Specks,2014-04-11 11:56:00,2710,Algonquin Webcam shows a crapton of melt since yesterday  http://www.algonquinpark.on.ca/virtual/webcam/index.php
847183,ccmtcanada,2014-04-11 12:56:00,7971,Today's image....  
847190,Kawartha Kev,2014-04-11 13:45:00,281,Here are 2 webcams from Lower Buckhorn and it is breaking up pretty good but the back bays will be iced up for a while yet. This one is from the Sunrise resort looking down the lake towards the narrows http://www.sunriseresort.ca/index.php/photo-video/webcam and here is the second from Reach Harbour resort which is about halfway down the lake looking out to the main channel   http://www.reachharbour.com/ just click on the webcam button at the top left of the page.  Kawartha Kev  P.S. Best to watch the Sunrise webcam in the afternoon when the sun shows the lake better also this cam updates every 5 sec. or so unlike the Reach Harbour cam which shows better through the day but only updates every hour or so  I think.
847262,SirCranksalot,2014-04-11 21:51:00,3291,The latest sat pix show G Bay from T'mory to about C'wood to be ice free.
846525,sneak_e_pete,2014-04-08 22:06:00,540,Hi there.  For the Simcoe guys....when do you expect boat fishing to be realistic?  Trying to plan some vacation days.
846529,Freshtrax,2014-04-08 22:28:00,2215,Last meek of May.  If we're lucky
846530,Terry,2014-04-08 22:30:00,14456,"21 of April, but I will not say which year"
846534,Sinker,2014-04-08 22:42:00,8692,"Last week of april sometime. I have a buddy icefishing on simcoe right now on his quad, so its not going to be any time soon."
846536,davey buoy,2014-04-08 22:44:00,5505,I'm hoping for May 10?.I think it could be hit and miss even by then.4 weeks away.
846544,BillM,2014-04-08 22:59:00,17367,First week of May is probably a good bet if the temps stay where they are and we get some rain..
846560,kickingfrog,2014-04-08 23:59:00,8333,Top end of Couch/Severn River was open on Sunday. Things are starting to get in gear now but it's going to be like the days of yore.
846563,Phil 65,2014-04-09 00:07:00,37,come on guys I have never missed an opening day because of ice in 32 years . and it isn't going to be this year either . we will be floating out there soon enough .
846571,kickingfrog,2014-04-09 00:21:00,8333,You talkin' 'bout bass right?
846579,Joey,2014-04-09 00:56:00,9122,"We should have a contest.  $5 to enter, winner takes all.  No same dates,if a date is taken, you have to pick another"
846581,linweir,2014-04-09 01:06:00,202,"My guess is May.8. Anyhow, should be before laker & whitefish season opens."
846586,Sinker,2014-04-09 01:34:00,8692,There will be open water before may for sure. Watch and see  S.

846698,Big Cliff,2014-04-09 17:35:00,6899,"Finally saw our first open water on Sturgeon Lake this morning. The river is open in front of Lunge Haven, it ususlly takes about two weeks for the chanel to be open here once we see that. Once the chanel is open it is usually another week before I can get my boat in. Looks like we will be fishing crappie and walleye at the same time this year!"
846699,ccmtcanada,2014-04-09 17:41:00,7971,This shot is from April. 6th...be interesting to see the next shot after the warm weather this week!  Just need a clear day!  You can check daily here.....  http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/modis.php?region=o&page=1  
846703,misfish,2014-04-09 18:07:00,29133,before the end of the month. April 30th.
846716,fishnsled,2014-04-09 19:29:00,3520,"I will agree with Brian and before the end of the month.  Closer to the end with the cold temps in the forecast next week, maybe even a bit of snow??"
846730,irishfield,2014-04-09 20:31:00,26272,"Didn't make it to Simcoe.. but Georgian Bay is turning white.. shoals, sandbars and normal current areas are open. Nottawasaga Bay is still locked up, other than the West shore has an open stretch along it and there is an open patch from the Western Islands down past the side of Christian Island to the gap between lighthouse point and the mainland.  Still gonna be awhile yet, but if we get some high winds that starts some wave action in the open spots she'll be toast pretty quickly.   "
846731,misfish,2014-04-09 20:33:00,29133,Ya wind will make quick work Wayne.  Thanks for the Video.
846735,fishnsled,2014-04-09 20:45:00,3520,Today's image.   
846736,irishfield,2014-04-09 20:45:00,26272,"That was this morning by the way... -2 allowed me to get across the mud to the 14 to 16"" of snow still on the runway. Think it was my last slide on snow for the season though..."
846740,fishnsled,2014-04-09 20:59:00,3520,"Fun videos to watch Wayne.    Just was looking and comparing the satellite pic the Cliff posted from April 6 and  today's pic.  Quite the difference down Quinte way.  The rest, not so much. Will be interesting to see what happens by Saturday after a couple more warm days.  A bit of rain with crazy winds tomorrow gusting to 70k for the Quinte area."
