846434,MSBruno,2014-04-08 14:04:00,369,Any tried these on Simcoe?  I'm more intersted in Balog's but they are only available via tacklewarehouse.com for $15/each and I would suspect the Storm's are more readily available and cheaper.  
846437,craigdritchie,2014-04-08 14:18:00,1586,"Nice, but pricey.  X-Zone Swammer is a pretty good goby imitator as well, especially in Pumpkin Candy or Road Kill Special colours. It absolutely rules on Lake Erie/ St Clair."
846441,MSBruno,2014-04-08 14:30:00,369,I currently use Kulik's Swammer on a football jig head ... just looking for something different that the fish may haven't seen.
846442,OhioFisherman,2014-04-08 14:39:00,6623,"http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Jewel_Bait_Sculpin/descpage-JS.html  These seemed to work pretty good on Lake Erie, fished on a jig head or drop shot."
846456,landry,2014-04-08 16:11:00,1005,I have the balog ones. I hardly tested them last year. The few smallie trips I did - I did well drop shotting so that is likely why. I also spend most of my summer muskie fishing. I will try them more this year. They would be great dragged on erie or at Clair I think.

846517,mike rousseau,2014-04-08 20:35:00,4661,We put a beating on the walleye with Gulp gobies fished on a 3/4 oz jig head....  Never tried the pre rigged ones.... They kinda look like they're made to trick us not the fish...
