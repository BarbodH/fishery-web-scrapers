Once the power returns after an outage in my neighbourhood.....my flippin' garage door opens!!  Can anyone ""esplain"" why?  Do I need a new motor and use the old one as an anchor?  Thanks,  Meely "
846720,leaf4,2014-04-09 19:44:00,2466,"Mine would do the same, but mine was also ancient, I ended up just disconnecting it because my tenants are too dumb to look before opening or closing the door"
846748,Big Cliff,2014-04-09 21:17:00,6899,Mine will do that if there is a lightning storm and the power flickers. I'd like to know the solution too!
