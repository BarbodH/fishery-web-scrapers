846466,barrystrs,2014-04-08 17:08:00,75,I have seen a cover that port Perry auto glass made and it was very nice.  However... I have also seen 2 wood/fibreglass repairs done by them.  They were poorly done bandaid repairs that came with ridiculously expensive bills.  They also scratched the windshield in my car while repairing a chip.  Good luck either way!
