846853,emjay88,2014-04-10 03:18:00,70,"Very interesting thread, and I'm happy to read everyone's different opinions and keeping things respectful.  Personally I have nothing but respect for our system's front line workers and health care professionals and have always received great care for the few times I needed it regardless of wait times.  I didn't mind waiting 6 hours to get an x rap removed from my thumb when there were clearly people in much worse shape than me (yes I tried to remove it myself, but the barb was stuck on my tendon).  At the end of the day in terms of comparing our system with the American one, the question is who do you trust more with your money? The government or an insurance company?  I realise this is not the ideal choice but our system is fundamentally better for a few different reasons.  The government has voters to answer to, where insurance companies have share holders to answer to, which means in the States it's all about profits at the end of the day not the average U.S citizen. Hence why so many un-neccesary test are ordered, drugs with kick back incentives are prescribed by doctors (the drug advertising is beyond ridiculous), and a family member's illness could potentially bankrupt the family. There is a whole industry built upon advertising drugs to citizens that they probably don't need and give big rips to the doctors who provide them, to the hundreds of law firms set up to then sue ""said"" drug companies for not mentioning one of the 12 side effects they listed.  Plus insurance companies reward agents if they can find a reason (usually in the fine print) to deny someone's claim.  As far as political reasons go I think Canada has it right.  As a fairly right wing person, I believe in less government involvement in our lives, except when it comes to health care and education.   As a first world country, I believe it is in our best interest for our government to invest in its citizens to be educated and healthy, regardless of their tax bracket. The rest is up to us.  I find it strange that the political right in the U.S based primarily in the bible belt calls our health care system fundamentally socialist because the government funds it for everyone?!?!  If that's the case than I'd like them to try and make education a pay as you go system.  Why is teaching a 14 year old calculus much more important than helping that kid through bone cancer without charging that family 100k at the very least.   Yes our system needs work, of course, and there will always be things to improve on, but at the the end of the day there is no way the general public will receive better care with a for-profit system.  Just my two cents. Cheers, Matt"

845875,mcdougy,2014-04-05 21:51:00,274,"My wife is a RN  in  the Critical Care trauma centre (intensive care)  here in London. She was bedside for 17 years in CCTC  and recently moved to be a coordinator of this same department. Health care is a daily topic for us. Sometimes heated between us.  Here is some interesting  thoughts for some. I have seen my wife 8 times  on Christmas Day  in the last 17 years. She wakes at 5am and out the door by 6:15am , returning home by 8pm at the earliest if on day shift. She is wiped out when she gets home. When on nite shift she would get home at 8 am  and get to bed at 9:30ish am because these where her mornings to spend with the kids then wake at 3 pm to get kid from school. It was. A 2 week day/ nite rotation also working every other weekend.  Needless to say to some, we passed through the door with a kiss a lot of days. NP . sacrifices were made by us  both and that's what life is about.  Sometimes I would be envious that her devotion to her job was supersedeing ME and the family. She is there for a reason, she likes/wants to help people. Many of her days become very emotional with the family of the sick/dying. She cries a lot at work due to passion to fix/help.  A lot of cases are tragic and almost always unexpected for the families. She is payed very well for this and should be. Her retirement is bright.   I think it is a general regard by nurses that many doctors could be a lot better/smarter.  Here in london, the hospitals are teaching facilities for the university of western. She comments on how money is wasted due to the teaching element. She claims ""they"" are willing to try many extra procedures/drugs in order to keep someone technically alive. Sometimes these procedures lead to life support equipment in order to carry them out. Once a person is ""hooked"" up , the end can be endless. Prolonged ends are very expensive. Also there are many times when a doctor is ready to stop further procedures and it is the family who wants ""everything"" done. Some people refuse that the ""end"" has come. Once the hospital/staff is told do everything, they must. Many drugs cost thousands of dollars , operations in the tens of thousands, CCTC is one nurse to every patient, the cost of a bed per day without anything is very high in her environment. And we as people are sometimes ""running"" the bill up to astronomical values. As a coordinator she now experiences how few resources there are throughout the system. Mainly staff. The government is trying to hire less qualified people at a lower cost, which helps in some situations, but hinders in a lot more. Quality of care can suffer and wait times. I voice my opinion as a taxpayer often with her. She often agrees, and says with a system so big ""the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing"". As far as emergency rooms go, we have all been there and can see what ""appears"" to be going on. Patients waiting, some staff working hard, some staff ""petting the dog"" .  In reality we have NO idea what's going on and causing the wait time and the staff have their hands tied because they can not get a patient out of ER  to another bed because their is no staff available in another department. The cardiac department is ""full"" the ortho dept. is ""full""  the medicine floor is ""full"".......   This is why you wait.  The poor guy comes in having a heart attack. ER staff is obligated to treat him first(access and stabilize) The ER does this and calls the cardiac unit to accept the patient. They cannot because they are full. The cardiac unit is full because they have a patient that is ready to go to ""the floor"" or medicine dept. The medicine dept is full and cannot accept the cardiac patient. And so on and so on. And you sit and wait for many hours with your not so ""important"" problem, while the ER staff has to tend to the guy with the heart attack that's not moving because there is a staffing problem.  We all get sick and hurt, and generally we all get better.  Unfortunately wait times and the hospital system is more than likely not going to improve any time soon unless even more money is spent on it. I know I feel I don't want to pay more taxes than I do now. So the equation is much larger then fixing health care with less money. Family doctors is a evolving scene also. I'm yet to decide on wether it is heading in the right direction. I seem to have to go for several appointments for some simple things. I'm sure they are getting paid per visit. As a tax payer I'm on guard to this philosophy. My mechanic fixes several things at once..just sayin. But I truly do not know the pay breakdown from ohip to my doctor."

Yes, every system has its flaws and the reason why we rant is because we care, we care about this country and want it to become better in all aspects.  I quickly googled 'rank of health care system' to find out Canada is No. #30 of 191 countries in WHO (World Health Organization). Not trying to throw other countries under the bus but I was completely shocked by some. (please see it yourself).  IMO, I do not mind higher taxes if it grants everyone in ER to be seen by GP in 5mins.  Everything in life can wait but patients in pain. For those who say they do not mind waiting, are liers, or they have not been serious pains yet.  No one will stay healthy forever, and it will be just a matter of time to 'do your share of ER wait time.  Once again, KUDO to health care givers and wish someone(s) can make this a better place."

845996,Canuck2fan,2014-04-06 14:36:00,1444,"I watch a TON of documentaries on health care from lots of different countries and there is no system in the world that doesn't have LONG wait times in ER, I think the staffing issue is just a small part of the problem. The overwhelming cause of delays are the friggin idiots who come in who DO NOT need to be there. That being said some of those are there because they have no choice for care because they don't have GP. I was one of those people for about 6yrs and went to the ER ONCE, during that period, and vowed the next time would be if ONLY if I was taken in against my will So I find it utterly insane to go through the hassle of going to an ER unless you are so close to dying you no longer care what happens to you LOL.  Another part of the problem with wait times that isn't often discussed publicly is how often staff can't face the day so they call in sick. Leaving areas scrambling to find enough staff to cover the duties required. I say this because I have a few family members in both the nursing and long term care fields who get 4 to 5 extra shifts a month EVERY MONTH many of them at overtime rates. When other employees call in with anal blindness (saying sorry I don't see my a$$ showing up today) It is ironic how so many studies show that in business if your employees are calling in sick a lot you have a sick working environment and you should fix it, yet this falls on deaf ears in health care.  While I have nothing but the highest respect for all the front line people I have met in health care, I have seen a lot of areas where management is way too entitled. It is pretty sickening to cater many a lavish board meeting, where the clowns in suits are deciding over a very expensive lunch, whose hours to cut on front line services, or hear them talking about how to spend 1000.00's to attract 100.00's in donations....  As for seeing some specialists, yes the wait times are too long but anybody who thinks having a private system in Canada will shorten them for any meaningful number of people is deluded. I say that because of simple math. There is no way a country with our population (lack of) density could support anything resembling what the rich Americans in large population centers enjoy with respect to speedy service. Also everyone on here seems to be forgetting the US has one of the most expensive health care systems in the world and they don't seem to be enjoying better outcomes because of it (link below).  http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-efficient-health-care-countries  If you check into it down there, there are vast areas that are under serviced as well because it is simply not going to be as profitable for the same type of quick health care to be available in a town of a 8,000 as there is, where there are more people than that in a few blocks.  So yeah maybe in certain areas a private system here could give a very select few faster better service. The reality is though, if those people have the 1900.00+ (typical cost in the US for FULL top of the line health care packages from some who SELLS them) to spend a MONTH, on extra health insurance for a family of four. Then we should let em buy a US policy or even a Mexican plan, (lets keep it Nafta which has been so good for us so far) and deduct it on their taxes as a health care expense, and charge them no fees for a passport as long as they have the health care policy in force. Then they can just take a vacation down south and get their care there. To me doing that shortens the waiting line here even more, because those people won't be in line here anymore, they will be on a medical holiday and getting away from winter while they are at it. WIN WIN for everybody concerned."
846197,bigugli,2014-04-07 14:35:00,6138,"The public's perception of our health care system is full of myth's, misconceptions, stereotypes, and plain naivete. I spent 10 years at what was once called TGH as a clerical and administrative assistant. In the off hours, I was part of a small administrative team responsible for keeping the wheels turning for the other hours of the day when the suits and paper doctors are not present. To start with, Ontario does not run our hospitals. They fund them, and then leave it to the hospitals boards of directors to spend the funds wisely. When a hospital goes over budget, they freeze OT, and close beds, but you never see management take the hit. A department may get shut down, but the dept head always seems to have a job. Did you know that TGH originally had a 1600 bed capacity? In my 10 years I watched 6 wards completely shut down and beds removed. At the time I was downsized out, capacity was around 750 beds. Lots of new research clinics and offices, because that is where the big dollars are. It's all about the politics of funding. As for wait times, well the Moose's story sound typical for even 20 years back. Patients are prioritized based on severity of need. On top of that, not every Emerg bad is available for Emerg patients awaiting treatment. You have the admissions backlog and bedspacers. Patient stacked up in the hallway on gurneys waiting for a bed in a ward. Then all you need is one patient to code, and one MVA trauma to roll in the door, and all your resources will be tied up for at least the next 2 hours. Meanwhile life in the rest of the hospital is no better. JC is suddenly doing another prototype transplant tying up 2 OR's for the next 12 hours. While additional transplants are quickly being fed into the OR for additional transplants made possible by the sudden availability of a donor. Which means I have to find ICU beds and additional ICU staff before the next shift start. The trickle down is that some of the more stable ICU patients get bumped into general wards earlier while still hooked up. More skills nurses are needed to look after them. Meanwhile, the wards now have a gurney or 2 out in the hallway by the nurse's station. While all of this is going on, the hospital is already short 10-12 skills nurses and 30 other RN's for the next shift. Outside agencies and overtime can't fill the holes. At one point I had 2 skills nurses in the system who were so valuable that they had not been able to take a vacation in 2 1/2 years. The hospital would not pay to increase the number of staff with their specific skill sets. It took the ministry's direct involvement to forcibly sideline one for 3 weeks. I have stayed many an extra double shift to sit and watch over disoriented patients so as to free up a nurse whose skills were better put to use caring for a number of patients. In short, the issues are manpower and money. There are people in the health system earning $1/2 million P.A. and more, who never get there hands dirty in health care. Hospital wards are converted to clinics and offices. Meanwhile actual patient care is overcrowded and understaffed. The money can be better spent. Just how that can happen is lost on me. I don't think another layer of government supervision will make any difference. Just another group of bureacrats adding to the cost of the system. As I said before, I was downsized out in the mid 90's. Best thing that could have ever happened to me. To be honest, we were already at the point where patients had already become nothing more than objects, not people. It was wrong then and it is wrong now."
846214,ch312,2014-04-07 15:27:00,1590,"If people stopped using the ER as their personal Dr, the wait times would be drastically reduced.   Also, if you are waiting for hours, then you are low on the priority list and need to question if you even need to be there.  It doesn't happen very often, but I totally agree with Bill.  Long wait times means you really don't need to be there. If you do actually need emergency care you will see a doctor, or at least be put in a room, as soon as you get there. But, try telling that to people who think a runny nose or a scratch means a trip to the ER and think they should receive treatment first simply because they were first in line. I know two ladies who have worked in the ER (10 years, and 23-24 years) and they say the hardest part of their job is dealing with the people who think every little issue requires a trip to the ER. Apparently they aren't allowed to send people home without seeing a doctor due to liability no matter how minor the issue might be. But, they can definitely make them wait to encourage the whiners to go home...   I think the best solution is to reduce taxes slightly and have a set fee for seeing any doctor. In the end it would cost us (well, those who work and pay taxes anyways) the same, yet people would be discouraged from visiting their doctor or the ER for minor issues that don't even require treatment."

If you have patience or can endure your problems our health care system, though far from perfect, will treat you well.   One of the larger hurdles is just getting in.   Many cite issues with our emergency rooms and patients being there that don't belong.   This is true but some don't have a choice. I know when my mother was in the big C fight and needed to be treated we had no alternative then to gain access by way of the emergency room.    This is how we were instructed by our family doctor.   Then this elderly and quite sick lady had to sit in emergency for 12 hours just to get access to a gurney that was against a wall in the hallway.   It was not until well into the next day they finally obtained a room/bed for her.  This did not sound like an isolated case.   I will add that when she did get into the system she was treated quite well by both nurses and doctors of the oncology department.   She was given a 15% chance at survival and we're blessed to still have her with us to this day.  She recently celebrated being 5 years clear!   She is one tuff old bird!! My brother moved to the US 25+ years ago and carry's extended health coverage.  He had a nagging sore back and was advised to get a cat scan.  Well within 4 days had the scan, they operated on him, removed 2 vertabrae (he had a tumor attached to them) and installed rods, pins, etc..   I could not believe how fast their system works, but of course you need good coverage.  He currently is in one of their best C hositals on the west coast and just received a bone marrow tranplant as part of his treatment.   He has 3 brothers but none of us were a good match but luckily they found two in there database! Yup, pretty darn lucky!   There was a point though when all funding ceased.   It seems there is some number that once you cross you need to re-justify your claim.   It did hold him back a bit but with a lot of help and support from his wife and doctors he was able to get the funding back for his continued treatment.   I don't know how one, if alone in that fight, would regain support.   There were hoops to jump through.   We have discussed his treatment and it appears the hospitals that he has used have been extreamly well equiped, and offer the latest in treatments.  In comparison our public hospitals appear to be juggling to stay afloat and have numerous shortages.  With our ever growing population how long can good ppl keep a broken system working?

How many healthy people are there in any given hospital or doctors office? Its a life support system.  How often are scripts written for vitamins and/or minerals that have been proven over decades to work in stemming or reversing the negative effects of many illnesses? Exactly. Docs aren't paid for those.  Heart and other organ transplants, limb reattachments and other medical advancements......BRILLIANT would be the word I would use when I think of the medical proffession in that sense. Anything other than that, not so much.  How many doctor endorsed commercials and marketing campaigns promote health through diet and and nutrition?  Why do you and I get sick? We never really ask that do we? We just assume the doctors have the answers.  A healthier diet combined with excersise would most certainly keep more of us out of the medical loop longer and therefore reduce wait times, unecessary treatments and the overall burden on any system. wouldn't it?  But how much money would the medical conglomerate stand to lose out on if that happened? We can throw all the money we want at it but it isn't goint to make us healthier. Only we can.  We are the only ones that can change health care because those firmly intrenched in it don't want it to. They believe their way is the only way and in mant facets of medicine they might be right but if we do everything we possibly can to avoid being sick in the first place wouldn't that help us all ?  Health Care? Say it over and over in your head and ask yourself what those words should really mean.  Just a thought."

846414,Moosebunk,2014-04-08 13:27:00,3970,"Going into college and university our kids have solid fundamentals in english, math, science and arts... but not health, wellness and illness.  Not at all.  PhysEd & Sex Ed don't cut it anymore.   So many people their entire lives lack a basic understanding of the one thing that is more important than anything else to each of us, living the healthy life.  Our system is used so heavily these days in great part because of this lacking education.  It would be very helpful if during the senior years of highschool, mandatory courses could be taught which study topics such as common injuries, illnesses and diseases, and wellness too.  Walking students whom have already learned some fundamentals in biology/anatomy, now into a basic pathophysiology through to symptoms, diagnosis and treatments common to health and care.  This would... Empower people (and society) when they would otherwise feel most vulnerable. Help those recognize their true need for the system. Promote preventative and healthier lifestyles.   Maybe rather than looking to fix any existing problems of a system sadly destined to worsen due to population growth, costs, time and increasing need, we prepare to make more of our people need the system less."

Like so many other things in life, it seems to me that money is the driving factor. We have heard here about how money or lack of it has caused so many problems. Then, I think about the multi-billion dollars spent on E-Health with virtually nothing to show for it. I think about the billions spent in this provincve to cancel a project, again, with nothing to show for it. So, it seems to me that there is actually plenty of money to go around, it's just not going around to the right places. That is a government problem, not a ""Health Care"" problem. HH"

Aside from the fact that it is free (not really IMO, isn't what the tax is for?), there seem to be lots area for improvement such as  - WAAAAAIT time -> My relative has to wait for 3 weeks before seeing a specialist. (what to do before then?) -> Even Emergency Room?!  It was quite upsetting & helpless feeling to wait in ER seeing others & your loves ones in pain for hours.  - Acute care availability  What are your thoughts?"
845701,Big Cliff,2014-04-05 10:19:00,6899,"Free: no, we pay for it through the nose.  Improvements: Well, there are so many needed!  It isn't perfect for sure but we are a lot better off than many other countries in this world. I know that sitting in ER for three + hours isn't fun (in fact there have been times I thought it was just being used as a deturent) but we could be living in a country where you don't even have an ER.  Is the cup half full or half empty?"

845706,moxie,2014-04-05 11:26:00,1566,It isn't free. 42 cents of every dollar they take from us goes directly into that black hole but Canadians lose their nut when you even mention allowing a shared public/private model that would alieviate some stresses on the system. It might actually help with efficiencies if those on the public side were given some healthy competition and shown how to manage a money tree that will not last an eternity. Trees do eventually fall ill and/or die.  We are luckier than most on earth but don't kid yourselves. There are better sysyems out there. We have had countless opportunities over the years to make our system the envy of the planet but have failed simply due to our inability to open our minds to other options and governments inability to just do what is right for all Canadians instead of just counting votes.  Edit: forgot to mention. We will go broke if they continue to throw more money at it instead of fixing it.

Or you go to the walk in clinic and wait for 4 hours to see a Dr. only to be told to get right over to ER and they will call ahead for you (then you still wait 3 hours in ER) what else are people supposed to do?  I do agree that there is some abuse of the system and they do seem to do a very good job of priorityzing but I have also sat in an ER for hours when there was no one else in there so I do question the reason for some of these wait times."

People die because they have to wait, older people receive less care because they prioritize younger patients, there are other ways of dealing with certain procedures/operations that we don't do here in Canada.  Uncle needed to have a growth removed and there was a specific, unobtrusive way of doing it.  No one in Ontario does it this way, or something along the lines of we use the easier method, which leave nasty scarring on the neck.  Ended up going to the States and shelling out good dollars outta his own pocket to get it done neatly.  Its not the best system but its hard to get this perfect and we actually don't have it too bad here.  4 hour waits are the least of our concerns!  If you want good service better show up to the hospital with $5,000 ( even more depending on the severity of your situation ) cash in your pocket and start greasing."

For the most part we have been treated within a reasonable amount of time.  I understand that certain procedure do have very long waiting times.  But neither I, nor my family have experienced this.

845804,Moosebunk,2014-04-05 15:47:00,3970,"This whole topic has to be the biggest can of worms for me, maybe especially today...  My day yesterday went...  I walked into Hell at 7:00am.  Actually I was late, the nurse that was to cover that overlap called in sick the night before but, another co-worker helped me out.  I took my youngest daughter to work with me and planned to sneak out 10 minutes at 9:00am to drop her at school... Anyways...  The ER is already near full and half these patients are what I'd call ""heavy,"" meaning very sick or, needing much done.  The regular nurse I was to be working with called in sick (both sick nurses work two jobs, one had completed six 12 hours in a row ending on two nights, because coverage EVERYWHERE seems to be an issue these days)  The replacement for the day is not an ER nurse.  She's a wonderfully helpful warm body who can work very hard, but she needs supervision.  Basically between us two, were at 75% staffing.  My break didn't come ti'll 3:15pm.  It was hard to sneak out for a leak and I ate a yogurt on the fly sometime around 11:00am.  The school called at 1:00pm hoping I'd come to pick up my daughter (Bren out of town) as, they're barely competent enough to administer Tylenol at the schools these days.  To their credit though, Leah (and now this morning Summer) both likely have food poisoning from some bad pizza and are upstairs sleeping off poopy times.  I tell the school I'll try to get there, but at the time I was actually and honestly in the middle of keeping an active heart-attack patient alive, his blood pressure 54/30 with severe moaning pains.  This one patient needs at least one Doctor's constant time, and my own to treat with life saving drugs and measures, thus leaving the rest of the ER to one non-ER nurse and at this point a very casual ER-pediatric RN in to cover our lunch breaks.  During this, the waiting room is full.  EVERY person in there has a complaint and the wait time has stretched to about five hours for the lesser urgent.  Half of them are in pain but not one in my opinion is close to dying.  There's two broken bones, a gnarly Abdomen painer, two children with respiratory illnesses, two measly non-emergent patients, a with-drawling drug user, a bladder infection... and these are the one's I know of.  One is lying on the floor and wretching, while the boiling mad husband of that Abdo painer is in my face the second I show it, angry we're not doing something and they have waited an hour now.  That extra pediatric ER nurse in time is observing the heart-attack patient, while my non-ER partner is helping the Doctor see other patients in-between treating the guy dying.  At this point specialists need to be consulted, ambulances arranged, we need accepting Ortho at one center for a fella in the department who fell off a roof and needs surgery, we need the Heart Institute for the MI patient, we must consider admission or transfer for the complicated Cancer patient, we need to get a migraine protocol up and running for a head-acher, we need to follow-up Ultrasound on a leg clot, ohhh and crap, there's nobody to manage triage and we gotta take care of that too.  The elevator is broken and the first hospital employee to notice comes to ask ME while I'm on the phone with medics to call maintenance... somebody needs a potty, another a Snellen test and repeat vitals, bloodwork, the local pharmacy wants a stupid CPSO number to fill a script, finance needs you to submit a bill for crutches, medical records wants you to recall if you sent that patient with a headache two weeks ago to Neurology at the Q or the Civic?  You lift your head, look around and notice other hospital staff is visiting in the hallways, laughing at jokes and lining up in the cafeteria to sure to get their 15-minutes for coffee and full lunch breaks as well.  The people in the ER's working, are juggling many other realities though...  Yesterday that was me, a Doc and one other.  What the ER's really need the most is...  More manpower.  More manpower.  More manpower.  More manpower.  More manpower.  More manpower.  Ohhhhhhh... and it needs all those people in the waiting room who are alive and breathing, all those people who will many times over in any given week or month wait an hour or two for their kids dental appointments, their oil changes, their food and wine to be served, their pizza to be delivered, their pharmacy orders to be processed, their paychecks to come every second Friday, their Cabela's order to cross the border... we need those people to sit and wait for what's worth waiting for more than ANYTHING else in their lives... their health. Just sit down and wait, it shouldn't kill you.  We need those people in the waiting room crying about the waiting to stop crying about waiting, and the ones who are crying because of illness or injury to do their best to understand that we want and will see you as soon as humanly possible, until then, you'll have to wait.  Please just cry later to your local elected officials, not us.  This would surely help wait times in the ER greatly.  For you, for me, for everyone.  Because it doesn't matter what ER it is in Ontario, the people in their are working their arses off even if their finally seen getting that chance to sit down and breathe a minute.  The people in their are putting themselves in harms way every shift they take, to take care of people under the system that (slow or not) is there for you.  To think too, Government wants to lower our shift premiums this bargaining round and give no raises, paying us less and probably paying us less than teachers.  Hell, more than half our staff dealing with the sick don't even qualify for one day of paid sick time, ever!!!  And if we take more than 3-days (unpaid) off sick without a note, they can investigate and discipline.  Full-time nurses with more than a decade (even two decades) of experience are still not being permitted vacations between May and October, March Break or Christmas, with that kind of time given from their lives.  Working every second weekend, mixed bags of days and nights for their work life.  Sit down and wait please.  Days like yesterday, juggling all that load and then some, running out finally to pick up my girl from school to bring her to my work, to look after her and pretty well every patient in the department, to even asking a Doc on his day off to come in and help, put a nurse 45-minutes away on ""stand-by"" from her day off, to arrange and pack our one Doctor on a patient transfer, to documenting much of this, to facing a waiting room with a few hissing people complaining we're not fast enough... Get it???  RANT OVER.  At 3:15pm I slipped from the department when I knew not one person was going to die, to take 15 minutes and have lunch.  A yogurt in 8 hours of running, I was shaking hungry, and today just bagged because of it.  Sneaking into a quiet room with Leah I took her temperature finally, then went to get some Tylenol while eating my sub.  Walking by the waiting room a patient says, ""must be nice to have time to eat, I've been sitting here three hours and I'm hungry too.""  Some people left.  The one's that did weren't ""emergencies"" anyways.  The sick got treated.  The second Doctor showed up before the extra lunch-coverage nurse went home.  For the next two hours we double-timed it quick to clear what we could of the ""waiting"" waiting room.  Me, a Doc, and that helpful non-ER nurse saw 30 some patients or so.  Got home to PB and toast dinner at 9:00pm.  Days like this are not unusual in any ER and oftentimes the staff pull 3-4 shifts like this in a row.  Writing this as an example will hopefully help anyone realize that, when it's your turn to wait in any ER, do so quietly and respectfully.  The system for sure needs help in this sector of healthcare, but the one's on the front-line don't need to hear that when they're busy in the trenches doing what they can to keep it going as best it can."

Walking by the waiting room a patient says, ""must be nice to have time to eat, I've been sitting here three hours and I'm hungry too.""  Some people left.  The one's that did weren't ""emergencies"" anyways.  The sick got treated.  The second Doctor showed up before the extra lunch-coverage nurse went home.  For the next two hours we double-timed it quick to clear what we could of the ""waiting"" waiting room.  Me, a Doc, and that helpful non-ER nurse saw 30 some patients or so.  Got home to PB and toast dinner at 9:00pm.  Days like this are not unusual in any ER and oftentimes the staff pull 3-4 shifts like this in a row.  Writing this as an example will hopefully help anyone realize that, when it's your turn to wait in any ER, do so quietly and respectfully.  The system for sure needs help in this sector of healthcare, but the one's on the front-line don't need to hear that when they're busy in the trenches doing what they can to keep it going as best it can.  Thank you Drew, it's important to hear first hand accounts of ER and how things can cascade. I've never complained while waiting with family in ER, other than what's on tv. Sister was an RN at East General so heard enough. Front line hospital staff do need to be paid better and to have our greatest respect."

However, anyone who's spent any time at the hospital knows that it could be A LOT better.    The constant budget cuts and mismanagement of funds are some of the biggest issues.     Let's start with all those overpaid ineffective administrators at most hospitals.   The CEO of the hospital here made over $500,000 a year.   Why?    Why is it in Ontario each hospital still has a board of directors when they are not needed?  (Although, I am not sure the LHINs would do any better).    No money to hire more nurses?  Well, let's just fill those shifts with current staff and pay them time and a half.  That's the logic we're dealing with.  Just like in the government, many hospital administrators are completely ineffective at the best of times.   Can you imagine what it's like in the current cash strapped environment.  That's just one part of a large problem.   There are issues with the doctors and the unions too.  Ultimately, our government, and everything it has it's fingers in, is a complete disaster.  As absurd as it sounds, if things with the government and economy continue on the current path, having some type of revolution within the next 100 years wouldn't surprise me."

Sniffling, runny nose, cough and a fever. I told her your daughter has a cold, take her home and get a dose of ibuprophen in her and let her rest. Nope, she's going to ER because she cant afford ibuprophen and want to get it via prescription???? Are you kidding me???? I went home and grabbed some for her. I couldn't believe she was actually gonna do that! Anyhow, i think the government screws up most things and it doesn't surprise me one bit. Last people I'd ever blame is the staff(like what bunk mentioned). These people basically give their life to help ours. The very definition of remarkable citizens. One of my good friends is a nurse and its amazing to see the commitment and enthusiasm he shows to helping people. If our whole society acted more like these people the world would be such an awesome place"
