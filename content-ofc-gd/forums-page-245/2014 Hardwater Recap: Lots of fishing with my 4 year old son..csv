847257,Walleye'm Fishing,2014-04-11 21:05:00,310,Thanks for the very kind comments gang.    Now I'm looking forward to open water fishing with my little guy.
847258,misfish,2014-04-11 21:17:00,29133,"When my two boys were at that age,I couldnt say no to taking them. First one started at age 2,the other a little  later,as he was kinda a mommys boy. Not that theres anything wrong with that. But once they both were full blown anglers,it was awesome to have them both with me fishing. It,s a feeling and memory you never forget.  Great report WNF.  Thanks for taking the time to post and share."
