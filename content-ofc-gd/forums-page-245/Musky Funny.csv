846690,crappieperchhunter,2014-04-09 16:58:00,2582,HAHA. I remember making that face once when I was carp fishing with Beans. This woman would come along everyday walking her 2 dogs and chatted with us. She enjoyed fishing as well and one day when we asked if she had fished lately she reported that she had and caught a good sized Muskie. Then she proceeded to tell us that she didn't really like the taste of it so she ended up feeding it to her dogs. We both told her she might not wanna repeat that story to very many people in case one of them was a hard core muskie guy

Haven't seen Fay since last fall Beansie. But I'm sure we will when we move up again the first of May. Our Caygeon countdown is on.
