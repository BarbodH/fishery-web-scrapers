845405,chris.brock,2014-04-03 20:08:00,4053,"crazy report, I enjoyed the recap of the Nipigon trip the most, not many people would do an extreme trip like that, that time of year, you guys are definitely hardcore  looks like you guys got 1 splake (guy in camo jacket and hoodie)?  those giant ling are pretty light in colour  so, the mighty Bravo got stuck, I met 2 trappers in the bush last weekend, who have been doing it for 35 years, both riding BR LTs and they have another back at home as a spare or for company to ride"
845417,Moosebunk,2014-04-03 21:10:00,3970,"... not many people would do an extreme trip like that, that time of year, you guys are definitely hardcore  Thanks brutha Chris!  It was an undertaking, I'm out of shape, aching in parts and still recovering a week later. lol."
845424,Fisherpete,2014-04-03 22:09:00,1814,"Incredible. The the trip, the fish, the photography and your writing and storytelling skills.  Thanks Bunk!"
845441,Sinker,2014-04-03 23:38:00,8692,"Good stuff dood! Great read, I enjoyed it! Great seein ya at bogie! Good times!!!  P.S...those lakers are huge man!!!!  S."
845447,Tomcat,2014-04-03 23:49:00,395,Great read with great pictures interspersed. Very much appreciate you making the time and getting the rust off your story telling skills. Thanks for sharing.
845490,Basskicker,2014-04-04 02:39:00,421,Thanks for the awesome report.....can't wait to get back on that big old lake....you never know what she's going to give up!! I can't believe you didn't try for some PIKE!!
845498,danc,2014-04-04 03:18:00,4677,"Spectaclar once again Drew. ""Nepigon"". I like it. Most would think that this was a typo, but you do your home work better than anybody that I know. And the results show. That pale white and olive green Burbot photo is the nicest that I've seen by far. Makes them almost look pretty. Hope to hook up this August if it's in the cards."

845510,Huronmtn,2014-04-04 04:35:00,29,"Moosebunk, Awesome report -- as usual (you seem to have a gift for capturing and sharing great reports).  When were on on the Nipigon? See you had 4 ft of ice. Just trying to get a sense on ice out there this year? Headed there last week of May for specks assuming ice is out."
845512,corvette1,2014-04-04 10:36:00,1765,awesome trip and video drew congrats
845660,RickOnt,2014-04-05 01:13:00,669,"Amazing 'Bunk'  What a report!!!  Family is growing up  You did your homework and put in the time and effort and it paid off 'Big Time'  Good for you.  Some beauty Fish and the pictures along with a great story Fantastic  Thanks for taking the time.  Nothing like sipping on a single malt after a long, tough but very 'Fun' day on the Lake   Cheers Rick"
845730,BillM,2014-04-05 12:37:00,17367,You read my mind Bunk!  I had plans to fly up to T-bay and do the exact same thing this year until my buddy got sick and that was it.   Next year for sure!!   I've been dreaming of ice fishing that lake for a while now   Surprised you didn't get into any whitefish!
845751,Rod Caster,2014-04-05 13:11:00,5784,"Nice. Time to take a break, fill that cheese locker and plan out your next awesome trip!  A great start to the day for me!"
845807,Moosebunk,2014-04-05 16:06:00,3970,"looks like you guys got 1 splake (guy in camo jacket and hoodie)?  so, the mighty Bravo got stuck, I met 2 trappers in the bush last weekend, who have been doing it for 35 years, both riding BR LTs and they have another back at home as a spare or for company to ride   Does look like kinda like a splake Chris, but Sinker would probably agree it was a laker.  He caught a few more of them that day, this one fish the smallest.  He ended up the derby winner taking home $100 with probably the best angling results that lake has ever seen during a Bogie gathering.   Good stuff dood! Great read, I enjoyed it! Great seein ya at bogie! Good times!!!  P.S...those lakers are huge man!!!!   Thanks Shane.  Nice to finally fish a day with you and Adam.  Some back-country running and Marty's mishap too.  Typical Bogie adventure material.  .   I can't believe you didn't try for some PIKE!!   I can!  The lakers are bigger and tougher, and there's already plenty good history of big iced pike for me.  One 40+ would have been great for memories sake though.   Spectaclar once again Drew. ""Nepigon"". I like it.   Been enough times in recent years Dan, guess I'm beginning to think ""old school.""  Knew you or Al would pick up on this.   Headed there last week of May for specks assuming ice is out.   Dunno if you'll be OK for that.  Forecasted days are starting to plus, need those nights to follow too.  LOTS of ice there.    Nothing like sipping on a single malt after a long, tough but very 'Fun' day on the Lake   Obviously agree here Rick.   Surprised you didn't get into any whitefish!  Steve accidentally jigged into the gill plate of one.  I didn't target them for even a minute, despite having some some gear and tackle for that.    Thanks for reading gang.  Pleased it's being enjoyed."
846080,S.M.05,2014-04-06 23:47:00,145,"I have been looking forward to reading this report for a while and it was worth the wait.Good to see you, Len and Steve got into some beau-T specimens up there.Nessie sized ling and those lakers dude........Hellz ya!That pic of the old Bravo buried in slush bring back some back aching memories. lolAnother great read Bunk."
846110,moxie,2014-04-07 01:23:00,1566,Always a great read Bunk. You live a blessed existence.
846299,TDunn,2014-04-07 21:52:00,680,Great report Drew! Very unique! Ice fishing that lake would be quiet the adventure! Awesome!
846393,Moosebunk,2014-04-08 12:06:00,3970,"Thanks Mikey and fellas.  Wish you hadn't sold your sled Mike, this will be some annual winter fun I think.  Wondering about ya over the last week Tyler.  Can't imagine the North Shore will be ready in about... 7 days?  Do have a stretch off work for some steel, yet things should be shaping up perfect around here."
