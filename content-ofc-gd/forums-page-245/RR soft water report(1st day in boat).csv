Weather was nice, sunny partly overcast at times, about +13 and a 15km wind outta the west. Unloaded the boat to find out the handle was broke on the 8hp, do'h. Only held on by the cables. We launched down an icy embankment, fun times! Motor was hard to start, but eventually we were out to the spot. Got on a good bite of walleye and had fun:) all fish on light gear, jig and minnows. Only took a few pics(sorry).  At the end of the afternoon it died hard. We ended up with 15 or so and 3 incidental sturgeon. Two real small the a decent 4' caught by my partner. Was fun and a great day on the water. Although we had expected some large 'eyes, we just couldn't find em. We lost 3 big walleye at the boat and missed ALOT of bites. Oh well, there is always tomorrow:) stay thirsty my friends!the launchhealthy sauger! eater walleyebaby dinosaur:)stringer(2 fish each)my eaterslast(for now) but not least, fish on!fish landed and released:).

846779,mike rousseau,2014-04-09 23:00:00,4661,Saweeeet  Tasty looking catch there
846780,leaf4,2014-04-09 23:01:00,2466,"sweet fish, wish I could catch some incidental sturgeon lol"

846791,moxie,2014-04-09 23:22:00,1566,Wow is right. Thanks for sharing.
846804,Musky or Specks,2014-04-10 00:14:00,2710,Awesome open water report.
846810,dave524,2014-04-10 00:50:00,4508,"Sturgeon are cool  , think I saw a Sauger in that mix too."
846811,Freshtrax,2014-04-10 00:56:00,2215,Sounds like an awesome way to spend the day!
846826,chris.brock,2014-04-10 01:48:00,4053,"pretty cool to have fishing like that basically in your backyard  do the sauger taste any different? I'm guessing no  we're staying plenty thirsty, don't worry about that"
846841,manitoubass2,2014-04-10 02:29:00,11391,"Misfish, thats my partner for the day puffin away lol. Yep that was a good size sauger, pic doesnt do it justice. 16-17"" my guess. Sauger taste exactly like walleye. Sturgeon are awesome! Its a shame there isn't a C&R policy on them, there so tough, a quick pic and release does zero harm. But in all honesty, when your looking for big walleye, sturgeon are kinda a pisser. They take a lot of time lol. Even that lil guy i got took 10 minutes to land. My buddies took a good 25, after he got spooled twice lol. Gnarly feeling fish on light tackle thats for sure! Supper was sure tasty tonight, we all ate well. And I got my third sunburn of the year, already have raccoon eyes haha. Thanks guys, glad you enjoyed the report! I sure enjoyed getting out there to make it:)"
