Shouts my emphatic friend. ""Um sure, I spose. But let me check my Navionics Super Barium for spots first"" I reply. ""Thats it! I found the most elusive shore spot EVER""!!!!!  Minutes later we'er loading up the 16"" Lund, loaded with our brand spanking new 300 horsepower Mercury tiller!!! Upon arrival, i have an idea. We, as anglers so often talk about fishing breaks, points etc. well what is the most prolific break for fish? The surface! Thats it, gameplay in motion. Ice out walleye on LiveTarget topwaters! So i tie on a VMC UV shortshank jig to my 10lb PowerPro, coupled with a Okuma 30a reel and 6'4"" Shimano Clarus rod. Moments later we arrive at our super elusive shore spot. First cast a 5lb walleye hammers my jig! ""Game ON!!!. Next cast, 8lb keeper for the grill! This is AMAZING!!! things slowed down after that just enough for us to cook some JOHNSONVILLE brats. ""Why do you love JOHNSONVILLE brats so much John""?  ""Mmmmm, meat"" he so elocuantly replies. Back to fishing. BAM! ""Get the Frabill! Get the FRABILL"" next up come this gorgeous pickereye around 12lbs. We never woulda landed that fish without our Mustang float suits Next fish comes on a Northland Tackle Buckshot jig, "" man those fish love these BUCKSHOTS! we decided one more fish before we left. I feel a hit, and fish on! ""Man that was a mush bite, he just sucked it. Let's call this fish Sidney Kadri"".  trip over, praise The Lord and saviour!!!! Thanks for tuning in, and until next time, stay thirsty my friends!"

846613,leaf4,2014-04-09 02:33:00,2466,"you fit a 300hp tiller on a 16"" boat... where's the picture of that! hahaha just playing nice catches"
846614,manitoubass2,2014-04-09 02:42:00,11391,This report is just satire my friends:) was a good 40 minutes of fishing. Just went to see how the launch was and happen to bring a rod:)
846619,Maverick,2014-04-09 03:01:00,371,"Man, awesome report. NONE of that would have been possible without the Johnsonvilles!"
846622,i2cool2fool,2014-04-09 03:30:00,349,Nice.  French's Mustard really saves the day and can be the difference maker on your Johnsonville brat while out for the day fishing. Pick up a bottle at your favorite retailer. In stores now at Walmart and Superstores.
