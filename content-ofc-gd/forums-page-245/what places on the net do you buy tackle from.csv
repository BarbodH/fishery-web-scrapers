846760,adempsey,2014-04-09 22:19:00,1498,"Besides the ones already mentioned, I've ordered online from:  www.eBay.com www.reelflies.ca www.yourbobbersdown.com www.jamminjigs.com www.captainhookswarehouse.com www.luremaking.com www.lurepartsonline.com"
847006,dracokaos,2014-04-10 18:12:00,116,"Never ordered anything yet, but their prices look ok  http://www.overstockbait.com/default.asp"
847015,bare foot wader,2014-04-10 18:34:00,1354,"I'd definitely recommend Scott, I think he is a member here? or maybe hipwader...bought a few rods and bunch of flies on short notice, competitive prices, fast shipping and great to deal with  http://www.flymart.ca/"
847026,Lape0019,2014-04-10 18:49:00,647,"  I actually stopped looking at this site a while ago. Although some of their prices are alright, most are a little bit of a rip off. I remember seeing a Gen 2 Abu Garcia Revo S for $10 - $15 more than what it cost when it was still available. This was reight after the Gen 3's came out and most other places were discounting this reel.  Maybe their tackle is alright, but I just stopped lookng there."
845242,skinny,2014-04-03 00:06:00,442,I'm always looking for places to surf and possibly buy from so tell me what you got 
845244,Gallie,2014-04-03 00:25:00,1215,I have only bought salmon tackle online and that was  fltackle for spoons and a-tom-ik for trolling flies. Im happy with both experiances Edit. I did buy something from bp online but only cause they didnt carry it at the vaughn store.
845245,mike rousseau,2014-04-03 00:27:00,4661,Cabelas...  Big Carp Tackle...  Rollie and Hellen's Musky Shop...
845258,Fisherman,2014-04-03 01:07:00,7201,"Cabelas, so far in over 20 years never had a problem with them."
845318,msp,2014-04-03 11:49:00,1336,I like a place out of Acron Ohio called Land Big Fish.com. Great guys to deal with
845332,bow slayer,2014-04-03 12:59:00,1074,"have dealt with these guys a couple times,excellent service,very good specials http://www.americanlegacyfishing.com/?utm_source=Newsletter+March+30%2C+2014&utm_campaign=March+30%2C+2014&utm_medium=email"
845337,BillM,2014-04-03 13:03:00,17367,"So many places...  USA, Japan, wherever.  Never a bad experience."
845430,Maverick,2014-04-03 22:34:00,371,"Anywhere that offers free shipping, this guy is good ‎https://www.americanlegacyfishing.com/‎ and has Sunline!"
845434,Fisherpete,2014-04-03 22:47:00,1814,"I bought a few things from American Legacy last year when they had free shipping on all orders - and they had some really great specials. But now they only offer the free shipping on orders over $200. Still good, but I haven't seen anything spectacular lately to pull the trigger on."
845435,buick14,2014-04-03 22:48:00,741,Nice looking chronarch fs on the used section on American legacy...
845473,Maverick,2014-04-04 01:43:00,371,"American Legacy still have the shipping specials, I think just last week was free shipping on all orders to Can and US. $25 minimum purchace."
845519,Andy,2014-04-04 12:18:00,330,"Cabela's. Lots of purchases, never a problem. Excellent service. Small brokerage fee, never hit with duty fees. Bass Pro. A few purchases. Average service. I didn't like it at first, I was getting hammered with duty fees on everything. But the last two times I've ordered when they were offering free shipping and I paid no duty fees. (for whatever reason) Rollie and Helens Musky Shop. Good service, not all items always in stock, which I understand for a smaller retailer. Used to pay duty fees and taxes but I didn't mind because they carry stuff that's hard to find in Canada. No duty fees or taxes the last couple of times. Musky Tackle Online. Excellent service. No duty fees yet. Joe's Sporting Goods in Minnesota. Good service. Only bought a reel there once. I may have had it shipped to my sister in the USA. St. Clair Hound Bucktails. A Canadian lure. Excellent service. Lil' Hustler Lure Tackle Company. Excellent service, but only ships to US address. Drifter Tackle. Only one purchase. Excellent service. Good luck, have fun. I make no promise re; duty or taxes. Andy"
845526,Lape0019,2014-04-04 12:32:00,647,Bass pro shops is alright to look and I have bought a few things there but most of my online stuff is ordered through TackleWarehouse.com
845595,Huronmtn,2014-04-04 18:55:00,29,"Lucky Strike and Mooshine for bulk spoons.  Panther Martin for bulk spinners.  Hareline-Dubbin for all fly tying supplies.  You can get a wholesale account with them if you are tying professionally.  Northwoods Wholeoutlet (Michigan) -- these guys are great.  They recently saved me $30 per reel on a 6-pack of $87 MSRP reels.  Lower than anyother place I have found.  If you call them and get a quote you get it much cheaper than the price they show in their online catalog.  Good old fashion sporting goods supplier.  FishUSA (Ohio) for all the small miscellaneous items  eBay when the price, with shipping, is favorable.   I avoid CABELAS -- high priced, but I do occasionally by some rods from them because they offered a lifetime warranty (and do stand behind the warranties, no questions asked). "
845625,David Chong,2014-04-04 21:26:00,836,"Unless I missed something, I'm surprised that no one mentioned Tackle Warehouse! I normally try to support as many local retailers as possible but occasionally you just can't find what you need in stock anywhere. I used them last fall for the first time and was impressed with the speed of the order delivery(2 days) and that there was no duties/taxes/brokerage fees when it arrived."
845628,Dan668,2014-04-04 21:45:00,1120,Tacklewarehouse for everything.
845629,MSBruno,2014-04-04 21:47:00,369,"Tackle Warehouse Tackle Warehouse Tackle Warehouse  all the time, no issues at all"
845633,Lape0019,2014-04-04 22:04:00,647,I forgot to mention I purchase bulk worms from Powerteamlures.com I stared using their sick sticks last year for wacky working and haven't looked back. I plan in tryin their finicky ticklers this year as well.  And supporting local is important to me. 90% of my tackle comes from 1 shop in Winchester. You will know the place if you know the area...

845719,mike rousseau,2014-04-05 12:18:00,4661,Also amazon has been great to me... Me and my brother just bought $200 off that site... Couldn't find the baits anywhere else online....
845973,Rich,2014-04-06 12:40:00,3927,"BPS , Cabelas and Amazon cover the bases for most of what I need."

I always see them asking $20 for a rapala. I haven't had luck there, Amazon.ca that is. I'll have to check again."
846678,Beans,2014-04-09 15:33:00,3339,New World Carp Tackle...mainly because most local bait and tackle shops don't carry much in the way of European/UK type tackle...
