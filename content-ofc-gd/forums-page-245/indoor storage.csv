846751,Terry,2014-04-09 21:32:00,14456,I moved to Innisfil and discovered my garage isn't as big as  I thunk it was  so now I am looking for year round indoor storage  my skidoo/atv in the summer and my boat in the winter I don't need heated the closer to innisfil the better but price is more important then being close  does anyone know of ant good deals  thanks
846764,kickingfrog,2014-04-09 22:33:00,8333,If it was summer storage for the boat and winter storage for the atv and ski-doo I wouldn't even charge rent to keep the stuff at my place.
846766,Terry,2014-04-09 22:37:00,14456,"yeah, that would work...lol for a minute I thought I suffered from Dyslexia"
846767,kickingfrog,2014-04-09 22:41:00,8333,You mean I might have had a shot? I should have worked on my proposal a little more.
846774,Terry,2014-04-09 22:55:00,14456,"eh no  I thought maybe I wrote the wrong thing in my first post, but a quick look cleared that up  you had no chance..  but 20 points for effort"
846778,aplumma,2014-04-09 22:59:00,6896,You can store them at my house for free.......   Art
846781,irishfield,2014-04-09 23:01:00,26272,"Well Terry.. you know, if you're stuck, where the sled and trailer can go for the summer."
846785,Terry,2014-04-09 23:06:00,14456,thanks Wayne I really  really am hoping to find something there must be barns or something around........
846825,mcdougy,2014-04-10 01:48:00,274,"Go for a drive, most farmers are pretty nice guys and like cheques. Maybe your local sled' atv dealer has a spot or knows someone who does."
846868,Terry,2014-04-10 09:12:00,14456,thanks for the info
846880,lew,2014-04-10 11:54:00,12766,"Barns are a great place to store toys Terry, I used one for my boat for about 9 years. If you do go that route though, just be sure you'll be able to get your stuff out when you want it. I knew the other guys who shared the barn with me so it was never an issue, but if your things are blocked by others you could have a problem.  Just something to think about."
846883,BillM,2014-04-10 12:14:00,17367,Shouldn't be too hard to find a barn around Innisfil
846885,Terry,2014-04-10 12:18:00,14456,Guess I will start knocking on doors.
