845054,tree4,2014-04-02 12:16:00,11,"I spent a week at Grundy lake. Lots of kids and very little privacy. All the lakes there have been fished out. Really nice beaches and clean washrooms. Nothing I would ever do again though. Dead silent by 10 pm and constant pp officers around. There's some good spots near the dokis reserve , part of French river provincial park. Check the maps for spots.Im pretty sure you can rent boats on the reserve."
845057,Stoty,2014-04-02 12:27:00,2910,"We are avid campers and our top parks have been - Bon Echo (awesome smallie/pike fishing and some of the best scenery in the province) - Restoule (awesome SM/LM/Pike fishing) - I am trying out the ""St. Lawrence National Park"" this summer on the St. L river. (That's def close to ""other things"" in case your wife gets bored)"
847068,c10,2014-04-10 20:45:00,131,"tree4, that sucks! As I said we went end of june and didn't have any problems with kids or our neighbours, but now that I think of it the Park rangers were real dicks the whole week we were there.  I mean the guys were literally hiding behind a bush beside our campsite at 9:55 so they could come chew us out for talking after 10.  I'm glad you said something because I had forgotten why we stopped going lol. It's sad because the place was really nice I thought, may have been what I am used to lol, but the only way I would go back is if i was certain all the previous Rangers were gone.  My bad on the last post! I knew there was something missing"
847177,gotfish,2014-04-11 12:09:00,53,There is a ton of crown land around algonquin park with free campling on small lakes accessable from fire route roads. Most can be accessable by car and others by truck. Alot of the lakes in that area have been stocked over the years. Us google earth and you will find what u are looking for.
847188,akaShag,2014-04-11 13:32:00,2073,"Google Maps suggests that Charleston Lake is somewhat further than you want to drive, but it is a great park, has lots of shaded campsites, has outdoor privies all over the place but also flush toilets and showers not that far a walk from anywhere, and a launch ramp inside the park.  The lake is a multi-species fishery and summertime is bass time.  Doug"
841869,Acountdeleted,2014-03-18 18:13:00,2562,"A good friend of mine and his girlfriend have decided that they want to go camping again this year which I am all for. Her stipulation was 'A place none of us have ever been before.'  As much as I like this idea, I want to make sure we get a campground that is still nice, isn't too far from home and hopefully has some fishing options.  Ok so here are the specs (again any help is appreciated). We live in Mississauga, I think 3 hours would be our max drive. (Can be pushed a little bit). Can't be a campsite any of us have ever been to OR a lake we have ever fished before.  We have been to/ fished:  The pinery Cyprus lake at Tobermory Balsam lake Scugog Quinte (No sandbanks  ) Presquille Somewhere in Algonquin (Though I don't remember where. I was 12) Chutes Provincial park (ultra sad I can't take them there)   I think that's it. Any species of fish is ok."
841887,Gerritt,2014-03-18 19:21:00,6129,I would vote for sandbanks if u haven't been  G
841888,Sinker,2014-03-18 19:29:00,8692,"Killbear, Killarney, Silent lake, Bon Echo.....   Does it have to be a provincial park? Why not go to kawartha highlands, or leslie frost (or whatever they call it now) up near dorset? Almost like crown camping, but you have to book, and pay for a site. Kind of remote, depending on your experience I guess.  S."
841889,muskymatt,2014-03-18 19:31:00,2608,"Nice camping, canoeing or boating, great fishing and swimming in beautiful water. Lot's of activities to do inside the park.  http://www.ontarioparks.com/park/murphyspoint"
841907,bow slayer,2014-03-18 20:31:00,1074,"well you would have to push it by about a half hour but I would suggest Restoule. Excellent park with nice waterfront sites,2 beaches,very good hiking trails,bike trails,great canoeing,boating and of course some very good fishing for walleye,smallies,musky,pike and lake trout. There are several back lakes which get very little pressure(you would probably be the only ones on some of them) even the main lake does not have the crowds some of the other parks  further south and closer to highway 11 get (Restoule is 45 minutes off 11). Park is very quiet,secluded with tons of water to explore,even hooks up to the french river canoe route.I have been camping there for 25 years now,and I have been to many others over the years,you would have a hard time finding a nicer park."

841916,Musky or Specks,2014-03-18 21:15:00,2710,Get one of the campsites at Restoule with its own beach. Great fishing very nice sites lots of hiking to do nice town to visit
841919,porkpie,2014-03-18 21:27:00,2521,"Another vote for restoule, even though it's farther than you want to travel.  Excellent place!  Failing that, Emily provincial park is close, and the fishing is not bad!"

841950,woodenboater,2014-03-18 23:27:00,2277,"If you can do something besides a provincial park, I'd suggest Lakair for camping. Very quiet, beautiful water (although no real beach). great owners and good walleye, pike and bass fishing. Primitive and electrical sites. Outhouse or flush with showers. Depending on your campsite, even wifi  and if you don't mind bunking together, the wall tent rocks.  Not too far from Sudbury or North Bay if you need a break.  Missed going last year so plan to make up for it this year."
841976,BillM,2014-03-19 01:09:00,17367,Driftwood on the Ottawa is really really nice.. Good fishing as well.

Also thanks everyone for all the advice. It was actually too good, now after showing them some of the options, they want to go a few times this summer."

I used to date a girl that loved it, but my wife really likes an organized provincial park.  Some women prefer to be close to a bathroom and showers!  If she's not that outdoorsy, I wouldn't push the crown land camping that hard!  You definately wouldn't regret restoule!"

842178,woodenboater,2014-03-20 01:37:00,2277,"While I love most PPs, you have to remember that not all maintenance/cleaning staff is the same across the board. Which means that while there will be comfort stations, the potential exists they could be pretty scary if not cleaned well. She may want to avoid the outhouses as well  Unless you're dead set on provincial park camping, I would research private campgrounds as well. They tend to be tighter re:noise and other disturbances, which may or may not enhance your experience, depending on what you guys want to do while camping."

844860,c10,2014-04-01 16:18:00,131,"I would suggest Grundy Lake for what you have described. It is about 4 hours drive from Hamilton up the 69 and is a really nice park with three lakes that are really easy to canoe and portage around.  I went a couple years ago with some of my city friends and they were all fine where we stayed.  The lots were really nice and there weren't many people when we went end of June, though that may be a different story further into the summer season A couple people above mentioned amenities and these were actually quite nice as they had toilet paper and had been cleaned recently! lol The park is failry popular from what I understand and was certainly well maintained and very very pretty.  this fishing was okay, the group i was with wasn't too into fishing so we only messed around for a couple of hours , but i still managed a few snot rockets and a few walleye - enough to keep the cityites amuzed ahaha. You can PM me if you have any questions or anything as well. Cheers! and hope you have a great trip! Chris"
844863,Garry2Rs,2014-04-01 16:34:00,1425,"Silent Lake is nice if you have canoes.  No motors are allowed. There are washrooms etc. and it's close to Apsley for supplies.  Depending on how self sufficient you are, as in don't need a washroom, and have a boat with a motor, there are lots of places on islands where you can camp for free in and around the Kawarthas.  PM me if you want suggestions.  There are also lots of canoe routes in the North Kawartha Highlands Park, where you portage into small lakes.  Most portages are short and easy."
