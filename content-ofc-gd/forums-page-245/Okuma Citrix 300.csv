847121,Andy,2014-04-10 23:54:00,330,"Anyone here have any experience with this reel? I am considering getting a new jerkbait reel for musky and pike. I am looking for a 6.3:1 ratio. I have a Shimano Curado 300 for small to med bucktails and spinnerbaits and two of the 5.4: 1 Toros for plastics and cranks. All great reels. But I wouldn't mind if I saved a few bucks on this reel.  I was intrigued with the Okuma Komodo, but the Citrix seems to be built on the same frame with less bearings. I can get it for almost the same money as a Abu 6601 C4, which I haven't ruled out either because of parts availability of ease of repair. Any input appreciated. Andy"

847408,Tim Mills,2014-04-12 22:48:00,476,Youtube's got a couple vids about these reels.
847423,Andy,2014-04-12 23:25:00,330,"Yeah, I've watched the videos and read the limited reviews. But nothing beats talking to someone that's used one. I think I'm gonna hold off and either go for a Shimano, or maybe the Okuma Komodo. I'm in no rush. Thx."
847441,Fishing4Tails,2014-04-13 00:05:00,38,I'm always a shimano fan but ... Diawa lexa 300 or 400 are priced well for high end reel .. Maybe check them out .
