846933,Stoty,2014-04-10 14:11:00,2910,Anyone have a contact in Durham region that does vinyl decals for a decent price. All the ones I'm finding want an arm and a leg for a few small decals.
846983,landry,2014-04-10 16:55:00,1005,Try ebay. I had some crestliner logos made up for my repainted traet a couple years ago and they were cheap and worked good.
846984,grimsbylander,2014-04-10 16:56:00,3016,I'm surprised to can't find something closer to home. There has to be someone in Detroit making it!!! LOL   I'm really sorry...I couldn't resist! Last crack I promise.
847045,Stoty,2014-04-10 19:27:00,2910,"I've been looking on eBay for a while but most of them seem to only ship to the US, and the ones that do ship to Canada are charging more than what the decals are worth. I should just find a small vinyl cutter and just make my own. lol"
847048,msp,2014-04-10 19:33:00,1336,I was at the flea market in pickering a couple of weeks ago and there was a guy there that will make whatever decal you want. Im sure he can help you out
847050,Stoty,2014-04-10 19:35:00,2910,Never even thought of that! Cheers!
847060,Handlebarz,2014-04-10 20:18:00,3790,I use a guy here in Chatham Peck signs I'm sure they can help you out they do all my stickers for my blades to boat decals to my banners they can do any size you need.
