847367,ch312,2014-04-12 19:04:00,1590,"In my experience the coyotes don't bother with the turkey's. They just keep on marching by them. You never hear about them yotes bothering geese either and those things are everywhere around here. Rabbits beware though obviously.  Yes indeed yotes will try to nab a turkey if the opportunity arises. They're opportunistic predators and will attempt to eat everything from mice and frogs to deer and moose calves. It won't be long and they'll be searching for nesting turkey hens in hopes of taking down both the hen and her clutch of eggs. While some may be against the idea of shooting coyotes in the spring which results in pups starving, I'd rather have the yotes taking a dirt nap instead of entire clutches of turkey, grouse, and waterfowl eggs being eaten up along with the young of many other animals being eaten by coyotes.  Coyote populations can get out of control very quickly because they'll eat anything, can live anywhere, and have no natural predators in most of Southern Ontario."
847419,mcdougy,2014-04-12 23:17:00,274,"Pretty much all my hunting is done within a 5-6 mile radius of the city dump. This seems to keep the coyotes pretty lazy in this neck of the woods apparently. Turkeys they don't bother with, the yotes keep going. I hunt the coyotes a little. have taken 5. Went out this year and though there was some tracks was unable to call one in.   IMO the snow amount doesn't give any advantage to a coyote on the hunt for much. I would give the edge to the deer and turkeys actually with deep snow.  The snow definetly gives me an advantage though for what ever I am hunting....or wait a sec....does it..? 3 inches sure does but 30"" not much.because I don't bother."
846738,Rustic-Fisher,2014-04-09 20:53:00,826,How's the scouting going ? I've been out scouting all week.  Places where flocks were 10-15 birds now hold 5-10 birds. Looks like it was a brutal winter for them up here. Anyone else ? R
846741,misfish,2014-04-09 21:02:00,29133,"Hey Ry  I get daily reports from the landonwer where I hunt (Phelpston area ) as he works with me. Numbers are very low compared to years before. He,s seeing more and more yotes and trying to pop them off every chance he gets from his back deck."
846744,irishfield,2014-04-09 21:08:00,26272,They've been waking me up every morning for the past week... clucking away and tearing up the grass on top of my septic tank!
846747,Big Cliff,2014-04-09 21:15:00,6899,Numbers are way down here too this year but there are plenty of yotes. I think this winter has really taken it's tole on the turkeys.
846768,Rustic-Fisher,2014-04-09 22:43:00,826,"That's what I figured , substantially less turkeys this year. Easy pickings for the yotes this winter. Been trying to plug away at them all winter also but now that spring is here I give the yotes  a break. Scored a few farms around here to hunt so I'm still hoping ."
846769,irishfield,2014-04-09 22:44:00,26272,Not sure why they'd be easy picking for the 'yotes.... they do fly and sit in trees.
846772,Sinker,2014-04-09 22:51:00,8692,"Turkeys are still in large winter groups, in isolated areas. What I mean is there are large groups, in a small area. Im not seeing turkeys in my usual spots, but a farm down the road has about 90 of them. They will start to spread out as the ground gets exposed, but I think its going to be a tough season. I havent heard any gobbling yet at all, and I check on these birds pretty much daily.  I dont think numbers are down, and I dont think yotes are getting as many as you might think either.  S."
846787,Rustic-Fisher,2014-04-09 23:17:00,826,"Starving birds are easy pickings, sick birds even easier ."

846793,misfish,2014-04-09 23:30:00,29133,"Layers of ice over prime food plots equals weaker birds more prone to predation /starvation and sickness. We've had a few good layers of ice built in to the snow pack around us this year. Starving birds are easy pickings, sick birds even easier .   This time of year with the warm thaw and cold tighting spells,it,s easy trotting for the preds."
846816,mcdougy,2014-04-10 01:24:00,274,"The large groups here, have started busting up. Have seen some courting going on, but the hens are not playing ..yet.   we had a large group  of 100+  all winter. The group is about 20 birds now. They have started there disappearing act IMO, they are still there. Me gonna eat one!!!!"

I havent heard any gobbling yet at all, and I check on these birds pretty much daily.  I dont think numbers are down, and I dont think yotes are getting as many as you might think either.  S.  Yep. A later spring means they're still flocked up which results in no birds here and dozens over there. Once the weather warms up the flocks will disperse and people will start seeing them again in the usual area's,.  Same with deer. People who do not know the animals habits will think the deer numbers are way down when in fact they're still herded up in many area's due to the late spring and heavy snow remaining. As with turkey, once the weather warms up and snow disappears the number of deer in each bush lot will return to near normal.   I have been fortunate enough to see coyotes stalking turkeys on a few occasions anywhere from 25 to 100 yards from my location. I'd assume the only coyotes who go after adult turkeys in the winter are young and inexperienced animals, or are very hungry, as they waste a ton of energy trying to catch the birds with very low success rates. Of the 3 times I have witnessed this, the coyotes didn't get within 20 yards of the birds before they took flight. Talk about one heck of a commotion when the coyotes started to sprint towards their prey!"
846948,jedimaster,2014-04-10 14:38:00,3472,First year turkey hunting for me. I will be out scouting next weekend. I don't even know if there are any turkeys where I am going but I will go out regardless. Great excuse to walk around the bush for a weekend.
846977,NAW,2014-04-10 16:17:00,4022,Lots inside Barrie city limits!!   I was biking near your place yesterday Ryan.  Heard a pack of yotes howling away around 6:30.  Just on the  south west side of Ivy.  Go get em!!  I haven't been seeing as many turkeys this year in my hood.  But I havnt been looking.  The fields last year where I would see 30+ deer are now down to 15-20..  Lots of deer kill sites in the general area.
846979,BillM,2014-04-10 16:21:00,17367,"Had a flock in the back yard of my parents house yesterday morning and again in the evening for the feed..  I love seeing them fly up into the trees, it's comical!"
846989,irishfield,2014-04-10 17:15:00,26272,Had one pecking on the back door this morning... guess the snow was hurting his feet!
847031,NAW,2014-04-10 19:00:00,4022,Invite him in.. Right in to the oven!
847051,myot,2014-04-10 19:35:00,131,5 of the 6 properties I hunt on are loaded my best property from last year looks pretty barren but there is still some time left for some to filter down in  Dan

847124,Sinker,2014-04-11 00:03:00,8692,"If ya hate yotes, and want them dead, while they have pups is the best time. One shot kills the whole fam damily!!  I dont hunt yotes, but I shoot every one that comes in range while im hunting anything else.  My turkeys started to travel today. They're headed for my go to spot  S."
847128,NAW,2014-04-11 00:48:00,4022,"Ya.  I'm the same way.  Rarely hunt coyotes in the summer unless I've been asked by a land owner.  But if the opportunity arises, I would still have a poke."

847351,turtle,2014-04-12 16:46:00,274,I've called in a number of coyotes while turkey hunting and shot them if they kept coming after they made me.  More often they changed direction and stayed out of shotgun range once they saw me. I saw less deer this winter than other years. In one field that in the past I regularly saw 5 deer and as many as 15 I saw a couple all winter. I'm not sure they moved elsewhere or the numbers are way down.  I think the long cold winter and ice on the ground caused as much grief for them as predators.  Deep snow made it hard to outrun the predators and quicker to tire out.  I did'nt spend much time in the bush this winter to check it out as the ice fishing season was so good.
