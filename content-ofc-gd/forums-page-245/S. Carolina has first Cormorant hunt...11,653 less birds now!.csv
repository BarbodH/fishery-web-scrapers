847073,BillM,2014-04-10 21:05:00,17367,Sweet!!!!
847075,dave524,2014-04-10 21:06:00,4508,"I really can't see anyone actually eating them as food, bet they'd be more unpalatable than a Merganser   I would think that they are classed as vermin, but letting them return to  the ecosystem where they fall might not win points with the anti's. Migrate???, I thought the birds in southern Ontario just flocked up on Lake Ontario for the winter or so it seems to this lakeside resident"
847078,Bernie,2014-04-10 21:19:00,3190,I'd be more than happy to purchase a few dozen boxes of 12 guage shells for a cull shoot.
847085,kickingfrog,2014-04-10 21:25:00,8333,"It's a start.  They do migrate and since the greatlakes mostly froze over this year any that would have normally stopped there would have had to move farther south.  Don't know about the taste, but other fishy tasting critters are eaten so lets have at it. Cormorant recipes anyone?  I'm guessing a lot of bbq sauce might be needed."
847089,misfish,2014-04-10 21:45:00,29133,"When it comes to DOWN SOUTH, they seem to have it right. Clean up the mess fast  . Up here,well we all know.   P3TA GETS IN THE WAY OF REASONABLE UNDERSTANDING.   "
847105,aplumma,2014-04-10 22:47:00,6896,"See if P3TA shows up to one of our Merican hunts they see shotguns, pistols and buck knifes so they keep their yaps shut...   Art"
847106,Maverick,2014-04-10 22:56:00,371,"Well, every little bit counts, I wouldn't mind a hunt up here."
847107,Fish Farmer,2014-04-10 22:57:00,2234,Anyone have a shotgun mount that goes between 2 downriggers
847118,FloatnFly,2014-04-10 23:48:00,1640,"Anyone have a shotgun mount that goes between 2 downriggers   we dive at them when we see them on the water, have managed to hit a couple off the hull"
847122,Sinker,2014-04-11 00:01:00,8692,"Let me tell ya, if there was a cull here, i'd be first in line!!!  Anything is good in pepperettes or sausage!  S."
847130,sneak_e_pete,2014-04-11 01:09:00,540,Can someone explain why they are protected?!?!
847132,OhioFisherman,2014-04-11 01:22:00,6623,"Hunting Cormorants makes more sense than hunting Morning Doves to me, do you get bonus points for jet skiers?"
847133,grimsbylander,2014-04-11 01:23:00,3016,Was the MNR not coating their eggs with shellac at one time? May be effective but sounds labour intensive and therefore $$$$.

847136,grimsbylander,2014-04-11 01:25:00,3016,Hahaha who hasn't wanted to shoot one of those?? Lol
847138,grimsbylander,2014-04-11 01:29:00,3016,Why would People Eating Tasty Animals care? Lol
847141,Dozer,2014-04-11 01:41:00,896,Fishermen are happy and the birders are pissed!
847150,captpierre,2014-04-11 02:40:00,2521,maybe other jurisdictions will wake up too

847322,farsider,2014-04-12 12:55:00,456," I am hoping it's South Carolina. Maybe our MNR could ""partner"" with our southern friends.  Keep their P3ta averse noses clean, while still effecting change.  Bounty, some free shells, subsidize the program/permits, award for most birds, disposal or distribution of birds, etc.  Cheers, Mark"
