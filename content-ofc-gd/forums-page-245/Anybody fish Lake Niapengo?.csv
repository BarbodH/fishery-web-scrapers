846507,Shloim,2014-04-08 19:21:00,515,Im looking for a small lake that will hopefully be melted soon. Im just wondering if its worthwhile. As much as I like fishing I like catching more...all advice is appreciated
846515,canliq,2014-04-08 20:21:00,24,"Lake Niapinco Past a few years back, where the lake contaminated with some chemical, so they not recommended to eat the fish from there. But if you just for fun fishing, that will be a lot of fun. Also I don't think so they open now. If you're in Hamilton area,  you can go to Hamilton Harbour or go to fifty mile creek, or Port Dolhousie"
