846987,DRIFTER_016,2014-04-10 17:05:00,10439,I saw it earlier this week. I wish my pooch were half as smart as this one.
846991,Headhunter,2014-04-10 17:32:00,5703,"Well, I decided to make an attempt and confirming that indeed, this is the world's smartest dog. I showed the video to my dog, ""Lucky"".  After close scrutiny, he suggested that this may not be ""The smartest dog in the world"" but more likely, the most brainwashed dog in the world. He then went back to knapping! HH"
