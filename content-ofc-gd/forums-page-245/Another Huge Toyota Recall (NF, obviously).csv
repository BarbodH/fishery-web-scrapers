I must say I am very pleased with the 05, all that I have done are the brakes and one piece of the exhaust and it has 260k on it. The 13 is still newish, 28k, so it is too early to tell if it will last as long but overall its a decent vehicle. With all these recalls hapenning it really makes you wonder what other corners were cut or if anything else was overlooked."
