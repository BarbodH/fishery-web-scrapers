846402,jedimaster,2014-04-08 12:37:00,3472,Ok so normally I don't go through these things... but I was a bit surprised to see malkin and ovechkin on the list and Crosby not on the list. I am not a huge Crosby fan by any stretch but... anyway take a look.  http://sports.ca.msn.com/photos/the-50-most-dominant-athletes-alive-in-2014-1#image=51
846403,buick14,2014-04-08 12:40:00,741,"Bo Jackson, Deion Sanders, Michael Jordan IMO"
846484,jedimaster,2014-04-08 18:01:00,3472,"I think its more currently active players. A 50 most dominant of all time? I owuld think I woul dhave to put Mike Tyson in the mix somewhere, Ali,  Jack Nicholos, Palmer, Tiger, Gretzkey, Orr, Montana, Marino, Bo Jackson... lots of supremely dominant athletes, and if they are including race car drivers, Schumacher would be hard ot leave off the list."
846486,Tayzak15,2014-04-08 18:08:00,318,Crosby doesn't belong on that list to me because he doesn't have the ability to take over games. With that being said this list is god awful with lots of players that shouldn't be on there and some that should be on there.
846494,kickingfrog,2014-04-08 18:47:00,8333,"It's ok to not like particular players, but when you spew lies you only look like a fool.  As for this ""list"". Since it's on the web it's not even good for wiping after finishing in the bathroom."
846510,jedimaster,2014-04-08 19:34:00,3472,"Yah, its a pretty lame list imo. I figured some of you would get a kick ot of it."
846516,misfish,2014-04-08 20:26:00,29133,"I think its more currently active players. A 50 most dominant of all time?

Theres one small guy you can add thats not there. Mark Martin."
846537,JoshS,2014-04-08 22:46:00,729,Whoa. I didn't read it all but scrolled through them and it's missing some big names. It is msn news though....
846552,BillM,2014-04-08 23:22:00,17367,"If you guys haven't seen ESPNs 30 for 30 on Bo Jackson, download it.   The guy is unreal."
846562,kickingfrog,2014-04-09 00:01:00,8333,Most of those  30 for 30 have been well worth watching.
846572,BillM,2014-04-09 00:21:00,17367,"Most of those  30 for 30 have been well worth watching.  Yup, great show."
846576,nancur373,2014-04-09 00:42:00,1211," Theres one small guy you can add thats not there. Mark Martin. Pretty sure it was 50 ""Athletes""...  Don't mind me, I'm still stunned from yesterday..."
846595,fishing n autograph,2014-04-09 01:47:00,2540,I don't agree with half of the people on the list but that's just my opinion
846644,Stoty,2014-04-09 12:10:00,2910,Phaneuf didn't make it???
846683,grt1,2014-04-09 16:21:00,638,"didn't read the list but it should have the everready bunnie, he just keeps going and then the Aflac duck because he has had a lot of injuries and keeps coming back, (must have good insurance plan)"
846685,fishing n autograph,2014-04-09 16:28:00,2540,He was good in Calgary because he was teamed up with Roman Hamrlik who was a great stay home defender and would cover phaneufs screw ups
