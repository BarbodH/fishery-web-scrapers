We'll have a sub challenge - battle of the pylons!  Anyone wrapped their head around how this scores out?  I haven't looked at it with any detail, figured one of you guys already studied it..."
184552,walleyejigger,2008-04-09 21:52:00,876,"got home  from work with not much time to spare, but i made it  btw, hasek is an awesome  pick up, if he stays healthy of course, would be worth the risk since it looks like we can do 2 trades?, even forsberg for that matter, he's been tearing it up since his return, if/when he doesn't make it past the first round or injured...... trade  of course i took my boy Price and also passed on the 'berg  GO HABS GO"

184567,Puckhead,2008-04-09 22:17:00,377,You've got until 11:00pm EST tonight to adjust your roster as many times as you like.  Then it's two trades (add/drops) given per week and they accumulate if you don't use them.  I think you can join until 11:00pm tonight for those that are asking...
184570,Stoty,2008-04-09 22:19:00,2910,"I'm in.  STOTY  I really wanted McMoron, but wasnt available. Oh wait, this isnt PGA.com's pool!"
184575,Puckhead,2008-04-09 22:32:00,377, Jamie - which team is yours?
184587,Pinch,2008-04-09 22:56:00,231," I wondered if you'd turn up!!!   Did you pick your twin brother, Spezza, for your team!! lol"
184593,Jigger,2008-04-09 23:05:00,1237,Im in.
184634,Stoty,2008-04-10 00:01:00,2910," Ha ha ha, naw. The Sens wont make it past round 1.  Probably next year's regular season pool though!"
184728,brickNblock,2008-04-10 02:25:00,598,Got my first 50 pts so far.... On the first game of the night.......Sykora/Whitney Calg/S.J just under way....... Stay tuned....... Good luck all.................. (under breath).......you guys suck...dont stand a chance.
184754,muskymike,2008-04-10 03:28:00,772,"How the hell do you tell if you got points? Mine says nothing so far, says it wont say until tomorrow.  maybe i just such"
184768,JohnF,2008-04-10 03:46:00,3494, Hah! I had Sykora too. Better yet I also have Roberts. He was my longshot extra man. I always liked him as a player. I believe he scores for the winning goal as well.  JF
184827,brickNblock,2008-04-10 13:14:00,598,It unbelievable how similar a lot of the teams in our division are. Im going to rethink my strategy a bit.
185522,Maverick,2008-04-11 17:22:00,371,"Hey, I signed up and made my team a the day before playoffs started but I can't seem to see my team when I log in. Can anybody else see my team?? Its Maverick0140. Maybe it messed up when i made it but i cant seem to find it."
185524,Stoty,2008-04-11 17:25:00,2910,"Nope, dont see that team. I see a ""Mavrick"" though.  You sure that isnt your team? Maybe Mavrick0140 is the username for the website you typed, and ""Mavrick"" is your team name."
185546,Maverick,2008-04-11 17:47:00,371," I think i figured it out, Thanks Stoty"
185690,Puckhead,2008-04-11 22:41:00,377,Keeerist Stoty - like the redwings eh?
184027,Puckhead,2008-04-08 23:44:00,377,"Seeing how everyone here seems to know everything about hockey - especially people from Ottawa for some wierd reason  The pool is free - bragging rights. Basically, the top of the standings will be all leaf fans and the bottom will be filled with sens fans, or something like that...  Simple playability - salary cap to keep it interesting round by round. I've never played this format personally but it seems to be one of the better free pools out there.... anyway, I'm rambling:  Here's the link:  OFC Playoff pool (sportingnews.com)  group name is OFC and password is OFC. Although I think this link takes you there anyway... register, select your roster and prepare to cry at your utter lack of hockey knowledge..."

184173,Puckhead,2008-04-09 01:31:00,377,"lol - i have no idea... I've never done this one either...  I'll see if there is something I can do from my end.  If not, we'll ignore it!   Anyone from Leaf nation is fine by me... alright, habs fans are OK too.......  Ok, fine, sens fans are welcome too..."

So I register with Kennymans Pylons and what do I find,...... Puckheads Pylons LOL. Where did you come up with your name? I got mine a few years back from the Messier Lays commercial and all my hockey fantasy teams have been called that since. What are the chances?Everybody draft your teams quickly, playoffs start tomorrow."
