An 8 to 10 episode season fishing 1 body of water, staying at 1 resort, fishing roughly 4 baits.  Oddly enough I still really like his show"
846160,manitoubass2,2014-04-07 11:20:00,11391,"I laughed hard at this quote from uncut angling, ""just another tv show host hiring a fishing guide"". Hahahahaha"

846165,Steve,2014-04-07 11:55:00,2075,"i still think the worst show was the one where the fella was pretending to do product testing in which his sponsor products won 9.5 / 10 times.  now I hear he has a new show...third one in five years I believe.  most recently i like the shows where Ron, Leo and the boys are fishing Lake Ontario with Jeff Chisholm....I learn a lot from Jeff.....  he's one of the best trollers out there.  he also gave credit to Scott Walcott for putting them on the area."
846169,lew,2014-04-07 12:08:00,12766,"I've said it here before, but the worst I ever saw was Charlie trolling muskies on LSC and when he hooked into one, he spammed 6 sponsors before he landed the fish."

846191,Renegade67,2014-04-07 14:04:00,86,"One of the biggest turn-offs of Charlie's show for me is the continual testing of pike lures at Reindeer Lake Lodge.  Its like he filmed 3/4's of his season there!  They should stick to waterways the everyday fishermen can get to.... It would be nice if some of these shows actually coverered some of the current issues within our waterways.   How often do they comment on evasive species, commercial harvests, etc. etc. I have emailed him before as well as other shows in regards and he was the only one that responded directly.   He is a stand up guy!! I was responded to by the producer of the FishnCanada show and he recommended that I tune ito their talk show on Roger's Sportsnet 590 the FAN, every Saturday morning from 8-10 am?   It sounded like the sponsors rule the tv time.  Sure looks that way!   He also tried to tell me that they cover these topics on their tv show but I can only recall that you should use a repelant with deet!   lol."
846193,BillM,2014-04-07 14:07:00,17367,"They wouldn't catch any fish if they stuck to the waterways everyone else fishes, lol."
846196,solopaddler,2014-04-07 14:22:00,8605,"What a lot of people don't realize, for the most part networks aren't purchasing fishing shows anymore. They used to, not anymore. This means that these shows are for all intents and purposes infomercials as they're paying for their air time and any monies that are made are solely from sponsors..  I can't stand watching fishing shows in general, they pretty much universally bore me."
846198,Maverick,2014-04-07 14:39:00,371,"GRAB THE FRABIL!  Had WFN on in the garage the other day for background noise when I was going through my fishing gear. Heard a guy say this, wasn't sure what he was going to do with the minnow bucket but looked up saw buddy reaching for the net and I just shook my head. Not sure what show it was but it is by far the worst of what I saw. Then came the Johnsonville Brats, what the hell does this have to do with fishing! ""What kind of brats do you eat here in Indiana, Johnsonville!!! They're savory!"" Are you kidding me... man. So I immediately went and picked up 17 packages of them!"

I can't think of the name of them for some reason, but good shows. Interesting spots, cool fish, the guy has a serious passion for fishing, and there are NO ADDS at all. He doesn't even mention rods/reels/tackle....he just fishes and loves it.  The traveling fisherman or something like that....I'm having a brain cramp....even river monsters is better than anything on WFN.....  S."
846285,landry,2014-04-07 20:52:00,1005,"It's true. They buy their time. All money made is through sponsorships. So anyone can have a show if they want to. The constant grinding for sponsorships would be tiring though. They need them to make money though and as a result oversell the products. I still watch WFN too much, much to my wife's chagrin. I want to fish everyday and it helps me with withdrawal symptoms."

846332,Garnet,2014-04-08 00:26:00,2056,A number of years ago the moved to ICast show from Los Vegas to Chicago.  I got to tag along with a local distributor. It really was cool to see baits that never made it to our store shelves for 10-15 years.  The funny thing I noticed was every bass and walleye musky ect pro was there and also every fishing show host.  They all had the prettiest shirts and slacks on and they all carried briefcase. Only think I could think of was to carry Kleenex to wipe their face off before they went in the next booth.
846346,Salmonidstalker,2014-04-08 01:37:00,265,"It's just advertising plain and simple.  I don't see how it's any different in other sports.  The fishing guys have to say it more because they don't have tv timeouts like on live hockey, or ads wrapped along the side boards, or Molson/Coors banners and flashing signs hanging from the stadium.  How about football, kick off, commercial, 3 and out, commercial, change of possession, commercial, touchdown, commercial, extra point, commercial, kick off, commercial etc."
846350,Tootsie II,2014-04-08 02:18:00,162,"The constant commercial plugging annoys the heck out of me. I rarely watch this show as the constant product plugging as well as the regular commercials just turn me off. I check in every now and then but when I see that nothing has changed, I'm gone. I'll bet some advertisers would pull some of their adds if they knew that so many people don't watch it for this reason. As an older fisherman, I see it as nothing but crass commercialism."

846406,Moosebunk,2014-04-08 12:44:00,3970,"I second Krupa.  He was a nut, but it was the best filming out there, and there was hardly an Ad in his show. (except the Outfitter's he was with)  Saturday & Sunday morning TV for me is better served up as some exotic escape.  Places where the fish and scenery tell the story.  Shows like Hooked with Mark Krupa, or Adventures North, and ""sometimes"" Real Fishing too are more enjoyable to watch.  Fishful Thinking I don't watch much at all, but when I do the product filter needs to be turned on.  Charlie certainly does know his stuff though and outside of the show I imagine he'd be a great fella to share a boat with.  I'd still watch his show before a lot of others.  As for WFN...  If surfing through the guide looking for something and The Next Bite or Musky Hunter is on, then I'll usually tune in awhile.  Thing with these guys is, I trust they are extremely knowledgeable about these ""other than bass"" species which they target.   Better entertainment can be found here at this and numerous other sites on the web though.  I think for fun we should make the month of May one where everyone tries to put up a fishing report, but they do so plugging as many used products they can.  It'll first be funny but probably grow annoying really quick."
845761,captpierre,2014-04-05 14:01:00,2521,Just finished watching Charlie do his thing.  It's a good thing he's a good teacher and I often learn a thing or 2.  But it's so annoying to hear him so blatantly promote his sponsors over and over ........  peter
845762,BillM,2014-04-05 14:02:00,17367,Kinda like most fishing shows out there unfortunately (Sans a few exceptions)
845764,porkpie,2014-04-05 14:10:00,2521,"They have to do it to pay the bills these days.  It was never as bad as this when I was a kid, you could watch a show without having product rammed down your throat all through it, they just went to a tackle talk type of segment where they pumped the product, and then back to the show.  I really like fishfull thinking, but I can't watch most of the shows these days for all the product placement."
845766,landry,2014-04-05 14:17:00,1005,I think careful product placement and stealth advertising is more effective than talking about the product - especially  to the level he does. He's a really good guy and a good angler.

But watching a person using the product and explaining how it worked and why it was different from other products is usually what peaks my interest.  Jason"
845787,grt1,2014-04-05 15:00:00,638,"he has some good tips on his show but I agree, the constant barrage of his pitching the products is enough to turn you off, someone should tell him to cool it a bit"

Dave Mercer is the worst for me.Need to go and get every lure he uses in his show lol.Thank goodness most times it's only one lure a show!

845821,landry,2014-04-05 17:30:00,1005,If I was a manufacturer I would want product placement and subtle promos. I would not want my product shared by a product checkout girl basically. That is exactly what some fishing show guys are. It's so blatant and over the top that it's hard to believe a new product is truly something I need. It actually makes me more cynical and suspicious.
845883,mike rousseau,2014-04-05 22:33:00,4661,"I'm cool with plugging a sponsor.. But Charlie says ""seagar"" about a hundred times a show.... He makes it seem like its impossible to catch fish without it and that it should be used in all situations...."

845919,Oggie,2014-04-06 00:15:00,588,I wonder how the sponsors feel about Charlie's need to constantly modify their product. It's very self serving and it reflects poorly on the original product. Is nothing ever good enough right out of the package.
845931,craigdritchie,2014-04-06 01:00:00,1586,"There's a big difference between a helpful product mention (lets face it, people want to know what the host is using) and a flat-out suck-and-blow, which - lets be honest - is what most of these shows really are. ""We're out in 90 feet of water today folks, and I tell ya, I would never have caught this fish without my dependable Fram oil filter,"" said the host on one program I recently saw. I'm not making that up. Come on man, really? That's just plain insulting.  I think I'm of reasonable intelligence ... so don't expect me to believe that unless I go buy a Fram oil filter, I'll never be able to catch average-sized lakers off the Niagara bar. I don't have a Fram oil filer now, and I already catch lakers bigger than what this TV Hero was getting. Is there a message in that, maybe?  Nor do I need to hear the sponsor's name repeated 17 times in a 22 minute program, as well as having the logo show up across the bottom of my screen in flashing graphics, oh and of course all the while the host is wearing an obnoxiously loud shirt with the same logo stenciled across his chest in eight inch high fluorescent letters. You know, just in case I missed the glow-in-the-dark wrap with the same sponsor logo all across his boat, and all over his truck in the obligatory launch ramp shot (because to get the $50 discount on his lease he agreed to show the truck in all 13 episodes).  Do they really think we're that stupid? Apparently they do.  TV fishing shows can be expensive to produce, and product sponsorship has always been a part of them. Done well, it provides legitimate value. But there's a fine line between being genuinely helpful, and turning your program into a non-stop sales pitch. Some hosts do a great job, they may approach that line but they never seem to cross it. Others - the crappy ones - don't cross the line so much as pole vault right over it."

In a half hour show there is 8 minutes of commercials (22 minutes of actual fishing show), part of that is eaten up by the intro and outro. Then they throw in more product talk e.g., Muskol, Cooper tires, Ram trucks.  Overall there is maybe 10 minutes of fishing. Not all shows do this to the same degree.  Prefer to watch other shows including the wealth of online stuff e.g., Uncut and New Fly"

846121,Fishwilly,2014-04-07 01:43:00,206,I agree about uncut angling. The kid catches tons of fish and explains his techniques well. This kind of show is the future of fishing on tv.
