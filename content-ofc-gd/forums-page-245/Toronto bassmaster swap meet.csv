846170,gotfish,2014-04-07 12:17:00,53,The takle swap was a huge success. It was the Candian Bass Aanglers Federations  North GTA chapter putting it on. Alot of great deals on new and used gear. Neddless to say im a couple hundred dollars poorer today but ended up with about $600 worth gear.
846203,bigugli,2014-04-07 14:46:00,6138,Pretty hard to turn a profit once the son started his spending spree!!! Gotta admit there were some sweet deals.
846205,SmokestackLightnin,2014-04-07 15:03:00,390,"My son and I went down and spent time going through all the goods.  There were deals to be had that's for sure.  It was a pretty good turnout, both buyers and sellers for the first time around.  I suspect next year will be bigger and busier.  Great job to Dave and all the volunteers, hope you enjoy the syrup and thanks for bringing my rod wraps.  I liked the picture outside the firehall with all the donated food going to the food bank."

Thx to the guy who gave my son an Evinrude hat for free.  I also went to the Hamilton Swap.  It was good as well but I didn't end up buying anything there.
