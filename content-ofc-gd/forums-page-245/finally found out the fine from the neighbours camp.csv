846630,outllaw,2014-04-09 11:30:00,1232,"mike r your dead on..possession limits are outdated in some lakes... reality is a lot of huys have some fillets in there freezer for winter months. yes leagally it not legal. are they fish hogs. in my opinion not really. possession limits need to be updated in regional lakes.. the rule book is also so flawed its beyond belief.. the mnr state no money,and yes they have become very aggressive in finding ways to charge/ticket folks.. its a sad story about a world class resource."
846652,Sinker,2014-04-09 12:59:00,8692,"I agree with Mike as well. I see more locals out keeping limits every day than I do visitors....  The locals even have the gall to brag about it.  No enforcement, shotty rules....what can ya do. Our govt is going to wreck this country before ya know it. Our resources are being raped in every direction, and they don't seem to give darn!  S."
846657,crappieperchhunter,2014-04-09 13:22:00,2582,"The law is the law and I have no sympathy for any poachers...but I agree with you Mike. Us ""locals"" that know the spots, what works and can slip out multiple times a week do way more damage then someone fishing during there week's vacation.  I have witnessed it for as long as I have been fishing. I don't keep near as many fish as I did when the kids where still at home....but I am never without some in the freezer. All perfectly legal and I am not a hog about it either. If everyone that had a fishing license harvested as many fish in a year as I do the fisheries would be in real bad shape....and I know LOTS of fishermen who harvest way more then I do.  It's a complex problem with no easy answers."

846705,aplumma,2014-04-09 18:23:00,6896,"happened to a friend of mine driving through Virginia, the cop didn't return his papers until he went to town and pay the fine There is a missing part to his story I live in Virginia and fish often with the local police when I ran it by them they agreed that there was something wrong with the story. If it was a ticket for 15 mph above the posted speed limit or less then it is a paper fine and have a nice day. If he was belligerent or the ticket was for a more serious offence then it would make sense. I personally was pulled over by the OPP and was inspected to see if I had locking devices on my trailer chains ans once confirmed he wished me a very nice vacation. Most Police are human just like me and you and while they are the deliverer of bad news that we brought on ourselves and will be the first to tell you that they write the tickets it is the judge or the court system that decides if it is just and what it is worth in the penalty department.   Art"
846335,grt1,2014-04-08 00:33:00,638,"Last summer the mnr caught a guy at the neighbours tourist camp and I have been trying to find out the results of his case. Finally I went to the mnr office in town and asked what the outcome was. the secretary asked the c.o. and emailed me the result.  the tourist (who had been coming here for years) had 28 walleye. that was 20 over his and his wife's limit. the fine was 2500 dollars and 1 year suspension on fishing in Ontario.  but his real cost was, he sold his boat (that he just bought 2 weeks prior to coming) to the marina in town. and they packed up and left Canada vowing never to return.  His loss is our gain"

I guess he will just go break the fisheries laws somewhere else now. Maybe somewhere like the USA where they don't care about their resources."
846340,dracokaos,2014-04-08 00:52:00,116,Good on him! absolutely no excuse for that kind of blatant disregard of the conservation laws!
846341,Raf,2014-04-08 00:55:00,3495,a win all around!!  unless you ask  the 20 walleye.
846342,Rod Caster,2014-04-08 00:57:00,5784,"I hope he meant Canada, and won't just go to another province."
846344,pairofgreenhorns,2014-04-08 01:10:00,133,serves them right
846345,woodenboater,2014-04-08 01:36:00,2277,"why would he sell his boat ? not enough cash for the fine ? but yeah, good he got hammered hard."
846351,Tootsie II,2014-04-08 02:21:00,162,"I hope the MNR sends his name to the Canadian Border Service so that if he enters any other province, they can notify the natural resources agency in that province."
846367,OhioFisherman,2014-04-08 04:34:00,6623,I never understood the mentality behind getting caught breaking the law and blaming someone else. It sounds like Canada would be much better off with out him as a guest.
846385,Stoty,2014-04-08 11:42:00,2910,That's Bull......just a slap on the wrist. 20 fish over the limit... he should have had ALL his gear repo'ed and the fine should have been AT LEAST double that.  That's a clear ignorance for our fish/fisheries.
846387,BillM,2014-04-08 11:43:00,17367,Should have never been allowed to fish in this country again.  20 over you're limit isn't an 'Oops'
846391,Stoty,2014-04-08 11:49:00,2910, EXACTLY!! Typical ignorance.
846411,Headhunter,2014-04-08 13:12:00,5703,But did they pay the fine before they left our province? I wonder if the MNR can reach out to out of province offenders to retrieve funds? HH

HH  I know that New York state has an agreement with Ontario for diving offences. I got stopped for not wearing my seat belt. I was warned by the trooper that if I didn't pay the fine; the MTO would not issue my license plate sticker until it was. So hopefully there is something like that for the MNR?  Dan.
846473,iFish4real,2014-04-08 17:24:00,386,I heard Canadians being caught speeding in US and escorted into nearest town to pay the fine. MNR should to the same to Americans especially for an offence like that...

If it can not be paid do to the severity (DUI or reckless speeding etc) you must show up in court then you get to go to town to the magistrate. Same for anyone who drives a vehicle in the USA that does not have a place of residence to live at till the court date can be made.   Art

846547,Musky or Specks,2014-04-08 23:08:00,2710,The reason they confiscate vehicle and boats is to ensure appearance. When you pay the fine you get your vehicle/boat back.
846607,mike rousseau,2014-04-09 02:11:00,4661,"I know I might take heat for this... But is he any worse doing this a few times a year then the guy keeping his  limit 5 times a week? Or a full time guide getting limits for 1-6 people per day all season....  I understand it's against the law...  And that's wrong... But as far as abusing our fisheries... maybe not as bad as others do legally...  In a week I'm legally allowed to catch... Keep... And eat 28 walleye of any size... That's if I fish alone... If I bring 2 buddies that triples...74 walleye me and my fishing buddies can catch... Keep and eat in a week... I can even have 16 in possession at my house for my family of 4... And that's just walleye...  Now if I go out and keep that many on one outing I'm the worst  case of resource abuse there can be...??  i don't think so... The guys getting 1-2-3 limits every week are doing more harm then this guy did...  If this is a reoccurring thing then yes I get it... Did he break the law and get punished... Yes... And that's great... But to make it sound like this 1 guy on possibly 1 day is the worst drain on our resources... That's a bit ridiculous..  But that's my weird view on the ""limit"" system we have... It's very flawed in my opinion... Bring on personal quotas....lol  To clarify... If ""I"" went out opening day and kept 28 walleye... Is that any worse then keeping 4 per day for 7 days on my vacation that week???  As far as abusing a resource??? No... It's the same thing...  I just wouldn't have to clean fish 7 times...lol...Legally different story...  Anyway... Not picking a fight... Just looking to get people thinking about our real issues..."
