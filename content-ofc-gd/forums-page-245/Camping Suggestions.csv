Looking for a recommendation on where to go camping. Place has to have a boat launch/dock (although i usually pull my boat out), and be pet friendly, have a comfort station and maybe a swimming area. Probably will spend most of the entire week fishing with my own boat. Looking anywhere up to an 8 hour drive. Normally i go to Restoule but most of the sites i like are booked at this time. Not to familiar with private campgrounds, usually i stay at a Ontario Prov Park which is why I'm looking for advice. Sort of want to try a new place.  Thanks"
846800,Musky or Specks,2014-04-10 00:07:00,2710,My second choice after Restoule is always Temagami.  Finlayson PP
846802,hotsky,2014-04-10 00:13:00,400,I always enjoy Long Point great for families (beach/swimming) as well as fishing.
846821,chris.brock,2014-04-10 01:38:00,4053,"2 of my favorites  For an 8 hour drive, and a week of time off, Barclay Bay, Missinaibi Lake, it gives you the feeling of remoteness unlike any other Ontario Prov. Park. Walleye, the chance at pike, lakers, and a slim chance at smallies.  If you don't want to go quite so far, Wakami PP is very cool. Walleye, pike and whitefish, and a great, remote vibe."

846861,bow slayer,2014-04-10 03:58:00,1074,"check out Halfway Lake PP. I was there last year for a couple nights. Real nice park with great sites,although not alot right on the water. The park has a great beach and the lake has pike ,bass,walleye and lake trout. When I was there the weather was rather crappy and cool so did not do alot of fishing,but did manage a few nice pike off shore. The lake had very little people on it fishing."
846862,bow slayer,2014-04-10 04:00:00,1074,"another option would be Bonnchere PP. It has lots of watersites,great beach,fishing for walleye,bass,pike. Only short drive to Pembroke and Ottawa for a day trip."
846870,chris.brock,2014-04-10 10:27:00,4053,"there's a short cut if you don't mind gravel roads, less than 8 hour drive"
846881,Stoty,2014-04-10 12:00:00,2910,"Bon Echo  Unreal scenery, great smallie/pike fishing.  Probably the most scenic boat launch in Ontario."

From the GTA I can get almost to White River in 11 hours. Wakami is 8 hours tops whether you use the shortcut or not.  I'll second both of Chris's suggestions. Regardless of a little bit more driving, if you're going for a full week then why not travel to a destination that'll offer a 10X better experience?  I can tell you right now If it was me and I had a week I'd be driving a LOT further than that!  If I was camping for a week and pulling my own boat this is where I'd be going. Damn near fly in quality fishing on an amazing body of water. Campsites are very nice as well:  http://www.osullivansrainbow.com/index.html"
