847312,Big Cliff,2014-04-12 10:23:00,6899,"13 years for robbing someone with a BB gun and no one getting hurt is pretty excessive I think. People drive drunk and kill people and get light or suspended sentenses.  As is pointed out in the article, ""If the point of incarceration is rehabilitation, the jobâ€™s already done""! What is putting this man in prison going to accomplish now other than destroying the man and his family. If he had evaded arrest all this time then I would feel differently but it was an error by the state, not him, he didn't try to hide or anything. Let there be justice in the justice system!"
847313,HTHM,2014-04-12 10:40:00,4082,This seems to reinforce the Finnish model of rehabilitation as an alternative to incarceration. How much different would this mans life be had he gone to prison and was being released today?
847314,outllaw,2014-04-12 11:23:00,1232,"amazing. he,s a hard working taxpayer with a family. some ones gotta take a hard look at that injustice."
847349,Joey,2014-04-12 16:20:00,9122,I agree with what's been said here.  He seems to be rehabilitated and has turned his life around.  What good will incarceration do for him or society now besides waste taxpayer's money?
847412,muddler,2014-04-12 22:55:00,623,What does the idiot that 'forgot' to do his job get? I agree with Joey. He seem st have rehabilitated without the states prison system. But it's Missouri not Canada.  muddler
