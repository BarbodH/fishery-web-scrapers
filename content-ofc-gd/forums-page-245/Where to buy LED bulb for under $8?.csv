What you need to pay attention to is the efficacy of the lamp which is the lumens per what of consumption....!  generally a 5 watt descent led witll be appx 400 lumens, thats a pretty god general purpose lamp. You should be able to get something of that lumens output for appx$8-10 each! keep in mind the 43 pack lamps are usually sold like that ause they are of lower quality thus to sweaten the pot they sell them in packs at an aggressive price to move as much p[roduct as possible because they already have the next gen lamp with the same consumption but with 10-20% more light ouptput that they want to push so ""out with the old and in twith the new""!"

Take your total cost on your bill divide by the total use (Kw/hrs) and you will see that by the time all the delivery, debt, this, that, and tax are added on you are actually paying almost 20 cents per Kw/hr.  Last time I did this I got 18.7 cents / kw/hr.  Not 'trying' anything with these number, it is just the way it is.  Try it.  What do you get?  If we were to look at the cost of gasoline like you are elecricity; the cost of gasoline would be.... something like 63 cents per Liter .... but then there is all that tax on it, so you end up paying something like $1.20 a Liter."

781270,bassassin,2013-04-21 13:51:00,152,"TORONTO HYDRO CURRENT ELECTRICITY RATES Electricity rates as of November 1, 2012.  If you're on Regulated Price Plan Tiered Pricing, your consumption in kilowatt hours (kWhs) is separated into two price tiers under the government's Regulated Price Plan.  Customers will be charged one rate for the first 600 kWhs of use per 30 days, while electricity consumed in excess of this threshold will be priced at a different rate.  The price threshold (the amount of electricity consumption that is charged at the lower price) will change twice a year for residential consumers.  The price threshold will be 1,000 kWhs per 30 days during the winter season (Nov. 1 - Apr. 30) and 600 kWhs during the summer season (May 1 - Oct. 31).  This allows consumers to use more electricity at a lower price in the winter. For more information visit the Ontario Energy Board's website.   If you're on Time-of-Use rates, your consumption in kWhs is separated into three periods.  Customers will be charged 11.7 cents per kWh in the Highest Price (On-Peak) period, 10.0 cents per kWh in the Mid Price (Mid-Peak) period and 6.5 cents per kWh in the Lowest Price (Off-Peak) period.  View more information about Time-of-Use rates."

Remember you are trying to calculate the cost per kWh here.. fees that are a constant on every bill cannot be affected by changes in your usage pattern thus they donot apply as a cost per kWh."

For what you are looking for 3W, 800 lumen, that does not exist.  If I said I could manufacture one for you there would be no way I could make the bulb last anywhere close to the 25,000-30000 hours they are rated.  Pushing an LED that much would decrease its life significantly.  What you would have is a fancy florescent bulb.  I do have an A19 bulb that has 300 degree coverage. ( all bulbs you see now are at most 180* with the exception of the Philips bulb but it is no where close to being as bright)   This is as close as you are going to get a bulb looking like a florescent/CFL bulb.  It is more affordable than Home Depot and under half the price of $35-$40 ( wow I am really pricing my bulbs too low!).

As for the night light - why not a standard motion sensor to turn on whatever light you want to plug into it?  It's only going to be on for whatever the timer is set for, and will come back on as soon as it senses again.  During the day or when other lights are on it'd just stay off.
