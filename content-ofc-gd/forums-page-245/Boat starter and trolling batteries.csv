847187,Raf,2014-04-11 13:31:00,3495,walmart & costco
847197,porkpie,2014-04-11 14:52:00,2521,"2nd vote for Costco, they have been good to me!"
847199,kickingfrog,2014-04-11 14:53:00,8333,Should have figured Costco would have good prices. Thanks.
847206,Lape0019,2014-04-11 15:44:00,647,It depends on the brand you want to buy.  Costco has good prices on their deep cycles which are kirkland branded and they seem to have great reviews. The Walmart batteries get good reviews for their price as well.  I just prefer Interstate Batteries and try to find the best price I can on the battery I want rather than finding the cheapest battery out there.
847212,Cosmos,2014-04-11 16:07:00,588,"I bought starting battery from Napa - they are on sale now. My 2 deep cycle came from total battery in Barrie, but they delivered for me free of charge to Newmarket and didn't charge disposal $15 fee."
847217,Roy,2014-04-11 17:02:00,13728,Both Kirkland and Interstate batteries are manufactured by Johnson Controls as far as I know.
847222,glen,2014-04-11 17:21:00,2641,Heard good things about The battery house in Barrie.
847230,Raf,2014-04-11 18:17:00,3495,Both Kirkland and Interstate batteries are manufactured by Johnson Controls as far as I know.  as are the walmart ones.
847254,Scott S,2014-04-11 20:53:00,203,The battery house on Ferndale. I've bought 3 batteries from him now. No complaints. He's a good old buoy from the rock! Scooter
847305,wormdunker,2014-04-12 02:56:00,1711,I have 2 Interstates in my boat.   Proper charging procedures are also important.  Go to   batterystuff.com   they explain the charging technology & different types of batteries very well.  Sulphation is the culprit why most batteries fail prematurely.
