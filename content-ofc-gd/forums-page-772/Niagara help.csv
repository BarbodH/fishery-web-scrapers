396725,bucktail,2009-10-27 13:10:00,1857,"Wondering if the trout are running the river in any numbers yet. I want to try fishing the river this year but have never drifted for the trout there before, I have fished the mouth for lakers. I was on a New York website and they stated the Lewiston Launch was closed for 2-4 weeks. Do the Americans have a Lewsiston launch or is that our launch? Other then Lweiston where is the next available launch?  Thanks D"
396728,ld17,2009-10-27 13:35:00,319,I believe our launch is the Queenston boat launch so it should be open.  That's all I can tell you.
396732,Roy,2009-10-27 13:45:00,13728,These are the US ones...Lewiston is at the bottom of the list. http://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/23883.html  And here's another collection...ramps are at the middle of the page. http://www.niagararecreation.com/fishing.shtml

396749,tipupesox,2009-10-27 14:41:00,167,There is a town launch ramp in Lewiston on North Water St.  Not sure why it would be closed unless they are performing repairs.

396779,johnnyb,2009-10-27 16:28:00,3413,I'm interested in the Bucktail's first question...any word on how the trout are doing?  Hearing little bits and pieces here and there....but no full fledged reports...
396795,basskicker09,2009-10-27 17:26:00,144,they are catching them really good in the wirlpool from what i hear still some salmon to be had if that helps at all
