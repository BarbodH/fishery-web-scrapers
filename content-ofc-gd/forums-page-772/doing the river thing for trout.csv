395188,xkempx,2009-10-21 20:58:00,84,Delhi..? What rivers run thoght there...
395192,tributaryhunter,2009-10-21 21:07:00,108,"big creek runs through delhi, roe, dewies, spinners, small spoons, flies, pink worms etc they all work"
395207,xkempx,2009-10-21 22:13:00,84,"Thats right...BIG creek,  I like to use pink tied marshmallow, Like a roe bag"
395269,splashhopper,2009-10-22 01:31:00,2931,pssst...... STOP NAMING THE RIVERS and the zones.....   read the conditions on this board that you all agreed to when you signed up....   maybe a mod can DELETE this entire topic asap.
395338,xkempx,2009-10-22 04:45:00,84," The rule say's ""VERY SPECIFIC information on fishing spots""  Where in your post did I or the other name a Specific pinned point spot, We name a river. No map, Gps, was ever used. Theres topics in here that saying BIG FISH AT BRONTE at this ZONE....I see nothing wrong with this post."
395351,laszlo,2009-10-22 10:46:00,487,"when mentioning a 'small creek' in a 'small town', that would seem pretty specific to me.  splashhopper - i got your back all the way on this one for sure."
395356,dave524,2009-10-22 11:22:00,4508,"Next to the Grand River, which is about the largest river system in Ontario on the Great Lakes, Big Creek is the next  biggest river system on the north shore of Erie. I have fished it for 50 years now, actually the very first migratory rainbow I witnessed caught , my dad got there in the spring of 60 or 61, the term steelhead for migratory rainbows was not even generally used in Ontario at that time. I'm sorry , but all I saw was that someone named the river that flowed through a certain town, no different than the Credit flows through Mississauga or Streetville. Specific info ?? no way, in that time and 2 years of living in Port Rowan I never got to all the fishable water there."

396012,MJL,2009-10-24 16:54:00,2427, Maybe too many loogans showed up and raped and pillaged the run of shrimps in his kitchen.  Tons of garbage like empty beer bottles and cans were also left behind.  He then put a No Trespassing sign up and closed off access to everyone.
