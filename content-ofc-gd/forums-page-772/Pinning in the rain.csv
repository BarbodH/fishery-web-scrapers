395983,danjang,2009-10-24 15:06:00,148,I was out last night trying to fish in the light rain. I managed to hook two but both were snapped off because it was almost impossible for me to properly palm the reel. The water made the reel super slick so I had to either put a lot of pressure or basically let the spool run free. So how do people overcome this?  -Dan
395994,johnnyb,2009-10-24 16:01:00,3413,I've heard they just switch to baitcasters
395996,MJL,2009-10-24 16:07:00,2427,"Welcome to the wonderful world of pinning in the rain  For me, I’ve got both hands working the palming rim.  When I’m using my Islander I’ve got my right hand pinky and ring fingers + left hand palm & thumb working as a break.  With my Angspec, I use the same set-up but always have the option flicking the drag on if I’m really desperate (rarely ever needed to use though – I occasionally just use it for carp or salmon off the pier).  When I’m fighting fish be it in the rain or in dry conditions, a lot of the time I have my rod angled down to the side, lock the spool handles in place with my left thumb and index finger and play the fish on the rod. Pretty amazing at how little line you need to give when you get used to it.  You can also sacrifice your knuckles to the reel handles in the name of slowing down a big mamma jamma"
396010,BillM,2009-10-24 16:48:00,17367,  Awesome!!  lol  I usually flip the drag on mine   I know it's lazy but sometimes I'm fumbling around with a landing glove and need that extra hand.
396014,KelfuN,2009-10-24 17:12:00,246,"you guys and ang spec!!  for me, i just use both hand...right hand with 2 fingers on the pin, left hand will be the extra/backup if the pin slips...  nevertheless, pinning in the rain isn't comfortable...but fun!"
396029,BillM,2009-10-24 17:44:00,17367,"Fighting a fish might be a bit of a pain in the rain, but man o man does it make trotting smooth!!!!!   Especially when I have roe juice all over my hands, lol."
396034,l2p,2009-10-24 18:00:00,346,"its the complete opposite for me, when i get into a fish i usualy wet one of my hands so that the reel spins smoother in my hand. that being said, ive never had the spool over spin on me!"
396375,thalweg,2009-10-26 05:10:00,112,Get a baitcaster.  Way better.
396378,SRT8 smoker craft,2009-10-26 05:38:00,1107,"I never ""palm"" my reel just use my thumb and mabye my pointer finger if it's a big fish never had a prob in the rain ."
396411,River Rat,2009-10-26 13:13:00,161,"I just ""finger"" the mono instead of the spool......on big water on the initial run, I will sometimes use regular fingr brakes on the rim with the left hand palming as well. Makes you works harder to land those bad boys but the reward is much better. It's more ""sporting"" IMO when the quarry has a chance of escape.  or you can just get a spinning reel or baitcaster and just crank em like a jeep on a winch.  RR"
