396621,silverstreak,2009-10-27 01:28:00,146,Love to Floatfish but also love the slam of a hardware hunting steelie. Managed a couple after work today using plain Brass spinners with tubing  . Switching it up every once in a while can often give you an edge. Cheers.

I kept thinking to myself i wish i had my spinner to blaze a few little meps by them, just to see what would happen.  Next time"
396685,Cookslav,2009-10-27 04:27:00,1457,"An old timer I used to know(whom had some incredible pictures on his wall) Used to swear by Spinners and Rapalas... He used to drift roe until November but once the salmon slowed, and snow fell he would  troll the mouth of our favorite river up as far as he could legally and back down over and over...and swore it was more productive for the bigger fish. And I couldn't argue as he had the pics to back it up. Well, 2 years ago when my luck was down on a cold wet and windy October after 3 days of skunkage I remembered what the old man had told me so I made a last ditch effort and was rewarded with my PB 31"" Bow 2 years ago on a rapala. If he was still around I'd buy that man a beer for the tip all those years ago."
