We're considering where to head for our first day hike...we're either going to staying local (Humber Valley/Kortright Centre) or go north.. MAybe even Algonquin for a day.  Any suggestion for good, scenic full day hikes in south-central Ontario? I thinking something within 2.5 hour drive.  Thanks!  p.s. We also want to start a hatchery and help out with stream re-hab along the Humber...  any input or perhaps association out there that would appreciate a group of enthusiastic teens? Does the equivalent to the CRAA exist for the Humber?  Much appreciated..."

396325,John Bacon,2009-10-26 01:38:00,3277,Metro East Anglers has supplied fish for school hatcheries in the past.  We operate Ringwood Hatchery on highway 48 near Stouville.  We will be there Wednesday evenings after 5:00pm and Sunday mornings starting at 9:00am to care for the Chinook eggs.  You can drop by on either of those days if you are interesting in seeing the operation.  Other times and/or a group tour with your students can be arranged if you contact us in advance.  Let me know if you are interested.
