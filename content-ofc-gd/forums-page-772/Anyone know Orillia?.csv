395912,bigugli,2009-10-24 00:41:00,6138,one good place right in orillia is the government docks right in town or the narrows right off highway twelve right behind the narrows plaza stop in the baitshop and im sure he will be happy to point you in the right direction or stop in at trombleys bait and tackle
395925,misfish,2009-10-24 01:30:00,29133," LOL Bruce. Those areas are off limits now.Ya know,MONEY TALKS,and fishermen WHO?"

395987,misfish,2009-10-24 15:35:00,29133,I meant the narrows area Bruce.
396196,ohhenrygsr,2009-10-25 15:48:00,947,Yea no one really knows that it's off limits but if you park a boat in the narrows you will get fined.  And i believe the same for the shore fishing
