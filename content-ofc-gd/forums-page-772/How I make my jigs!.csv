394563,highdrifter,2009-10-20 00:28:00,2534,"For moi??!  I'll revel over them in a bit.  The missus needs her speed walk!  luv, Skeebone"
394564,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-20 00:28:00,3761,What a great past time that must be. Great job GCD. Some good old southern tunes would be good for next time
394566,Roy,2009-10-20 00:32:00,13728,"Very well done, Glen! Some great pics in there. You really make fine quality jigs."
394567,ADB,2009-10-20 00:33:00,444,"Cool video, GCD.  You said you made 150 jigs?  How much do you figure that cost you?"
394574,JohnF,2009-10-20 00:48:00,3494,Now I feel guilty about how little I paid for mine.  JF
394600,ohhenrygsr,2009-10-20 01:50:00,947,That's Awesome Glen where did you get your supplies?
394601,Leecher,2009-10-20 01:51:00,7832,Now that was a thing of beauty Glen So many steps into making those jigs!!!  They are a real work of art   :clapping: Take a bow my friend.... you deserve it   :worthy:  Loved to video and you did a great job of it   Movie maker is such a great little program. Question for you:  How long does it take from start to finish to make a batch of jigs??  Now you got to promise me that your next video will be from your boat..... want to see you live in action Again awesome job Glen and thanks for sharing Jacques
394605,backbay,2009-10-20 02:05:00,773,"Glen, those things are great, like REALLY great! That's a lot of work you do to make them too. The only concern I have is that I think you're gonna void the warranty on your cappuccino maker by melting the lead in it, bro!"
394606,Dara,2009-10-20 02:10:00,3052,Nice job on the jigs. Best way around that pesky copyright stuff is to maybe PAY FOR IT
394607,highdrifter,2009-10-20 02:12:00,2534,"Very noice my friend.  Psychedelic!!  Too bad about the copywrite filter..  Pray tell..  what tune did you have picked out?  That bout of creativity needs to go with something a little..  floydesk.  Two internet windows, a little synchronicity...  shouldn't be too hard!  cheers HD"
394667,Greencoachdog,2009-10-20 09:03:00,8163," I made 120 jigs, my initial setup cost was around $500  $115 for 23 jars of paint $125 for 50 lbs. lead $75 for the melting furnace $120 for 12 boxes of hooks @ 100 hooks per box $40 for the mold $40 for 2 toaster ovens  When you figure the price of just the materials only per jig it's about $.05 for lead, $.05 for paint and $.10 for the hook = 20 cents per jig... when you add in the labor, it's about $5 per jig!    Thanks Henry, I got the Melting furnace from http://www.jannsnetcraft.com/ I bought the mold from Cabelas I buy my lead from http://www.rotometals.com/ I buy the hooks from http://www.do-itmolds.com/ ... and I buy the paint from http://lurepartsonline.com/cart.html  ... as you can see, everything was bought online and I shop around for the best deals.    It takes about 3 hours to pour them and about that long to ""clean"" them up for painting = 6 hrs  I can paint 40 in 6 hrs. ... so I have about 24 hrs. in a batch of 120 jigs    Who does THAT???  I actually did pay for it, it was off of a CD I bought.  Thanks for the kind words y'all!"
394709,TC1OZ,2009-10-20 12:49:00,987,Good job GCD! Thats one thing I miss about the south...pride!
394745,basskicker09,2009-10-20 14:13:00,144,how much of the bees wax do you put it the pot of lead?
394749,johnnyb,2009-10-20 14:21:00,3413,
394760,ChrisK,2009-10-20 14:55:00,2772,Nice job Glen !! Its a wonder why everyone like these jigs..sweet !!  I see your doing the smelting process outside...Is that because of the toxic fumes the lead gives off in this part of the process ?? When I poured lead jigs I did it in a work shed with ventilation fans pushing air to the outdoors kinda like a oven hood would do....Just thought I would throw that in for anyone who was thinking of doing there own after watching this video.... Keep up the fine work Glen and uh.....you got any left over you know where I live  Cheers !!
394761,Fish4Eyes,2009-10-20 15:29:00,1022,"I will never complain again when I am paying too much for jigs at the store, now I know why."
394765,NAW,2009-10-20 15:42:00,4022,Very cool Glen.
394804,Greencoachdog,2009-10-20 17:57:00,8163," I use a ball about the size of a 1/4 oz. jig head. When you drop it in the pot stir quickly but very carefully and be prepared for a flame because sometime the wax will ignite, if the wax doesn't ignite it will smoke a lot... you can ignite the smoke with a lighter, some folks say the extra heat from the fire helps.  When stirring the wax in, scrape the sides and bottom of the pot.. all the trash and oxidation will float to the top so you can skim it off. I prefer something with a wooden handle for stirring and skimming so as not to conduct the heat from the lead.    Yes! Melting lead gives off toxic/noxious fumes and I won't do it in an enclosed area!!! You can do it the way you described, but I just feel better about doing it outside!!!  I do paint my jigs in the garage, but I always open the big garage door for ventilation. The paint is non toxic... but you're still heating bare lead until you get the first coat of paint on the jig.   Thanks again for the kind words y'all!"
394807,basskicker09,2009-10-20 18:03:00,144,thanks for the very helpful info i make my own jigs as well and didnt know how to stop the oxidization

394913,ctdd2006,2009-10-20 23:33:00,531,Just got mine last week GCD.  Very impressive.  Very happy with the way they look.  The packaging was equally impressive!  Gotta go try them!  Money well spent BOTH ways!
