I am wondering what other folks that might be fishing shield-lakes are using for drop-shot baits. I have been using 4"" senkos and small trick worms with some success. Anything else I should try?"
395934,johnnyb,2009-10-24 01:46:00,3413,"I'm gonna be trying a 3"" YUM money minnow this weekend...looks ultra natural and has a very nice finesse action. Hopefully will have a report to post on it"
395939,bigugli,2009-10-24 02:03:00,6138,3 1/2  FinS  minnow or 3 1/2 Gulp minnow
395955,Greencoachdog,2009-10-24 03:21:00,8163, Will the LLJ be in this report????????????????????????????????????????     ... a semi-realistic minnow bait on a drop-shot rig???... whod'a ever thunk it???... now all we have to determine is what color?... white?... shad... chartreuse... or pink????   ... has anyone ever thought of using a live minnow on a drop shot rig?

396097,BIG FISH,2009-10-25 00:07:00,54,the baits you are using are good. stirke zone slammers work great too    . i usually use a longer lead between the hook and my bait up to 4 ft .  if drop shot doesnt work try shaky head with the same worms
