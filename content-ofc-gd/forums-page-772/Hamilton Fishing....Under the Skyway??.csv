395180,justwannafish,2009-10-21 20:16:00,82,"Hey everyone! I've just recently started to fish Hamilton. Can anyone give me some relatively precise direction? Not really sure where I should be going, what I should be using, or what I can expect to catch this time of year. I don't have a boat so I'm just looking for shore fishing opportunities. Also, I've heard that fishing under the skyway has been producing lately. I'm actually there right now but don't really know what gear I should be using. And it's pretty cool and foggy so there's noone here. I'm not sure if that's because the people don't like the weather or the fish don't! Anyway, any help anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks guys!!"
395184,bubbles,2009-10-21 20:21:00,591,Sorry can't help you at all I just think it is awesome that you are there RIGHT NOW and posting this. God Bless Technology!  Good Luck!
395187,fishinguypat,2009-10-21 20:49:00,547,throw glow cleos of the piers when it becomes dark or use roe to catch brown trout and rainbow trout ..now you still may have a chance to catch salmon
395228,uglyfish,2009-10-21 23:30:00,981,"most of the salmon have already gone up the creeks and rivers, u may find one here or there still. fish the harbour, tons of area to fish from shore. largies, smallies, pike, salmon, trout, crappie, perch, catfish, carp. tons of fish around, and some big ones too."
395233,justwannafish,2009-10-21 23:56:00,82,Awesome thanks guys! I didn't expect such helpful replies so quick! I know the salmon run up Credit but what about Bronte? And i haven't fished for salmon so I don't know very much about it but can they still be caught when they go upriver to spawn? And if anyone knows of any shore spots on either of those (or other) rivers I'd love to hear about them! Thanks again!
395236,danbouck,2009-10-22 00:04:00,4380,Please don't mention Bronte! PLEASE!!!
395284,Twocoda,2009-10-22 02:09:00,4130,for some reason this has a familiar tone to it with a different note....lol....creative i must say ...lol...   welcome to the board...again?
395297,Sudzy,2009-10-22 02:42:00,88,  In Hamilton Harbour?? Where???
395312,mojobass,2009-10-22 03:04:00,34,"I'm actually interested too to know, I was down at Hamilton to visit my girlfriend so I brought my rods and gear. Was gonna pay the harbour a visit but wasn't confident enough to know what's there."
395336,justwannafish,2009-10-22 04:29:00,82, how come??
395339,xkempx,2009-10-22 04:50:00,84,   Go if you want. But you wont be happy.. Its a MUD hole.
395367,uglyfish,2009-10-22 12:14:00,981,"anyplace by pier 4 park, tons of shore access there, down by bayfront boat launch, again, tons of area to fish. burlington side by lasalle marina has access too. i fish down there a lot, and that where i took all my kids for their first fishing trip. senkos and white spinnerbaits will net ya some bass, spinners also work on pike, crappie and perch will take minnows, catfish will hit worms... just play around with things.  biggest smallie i;ve seen was 3lbs even i caught last year. biggest largie was 5lb 7oz caught by my buddy in a club tourney, also seen a few 4lb + fish biggest pike was 17lb caught through the ice 2 years ago... i;ve seen bigger ones there too. biggest carp was 58lbs seen caught by another guy. my buddy caught a crappie and perch that were just monsters.  lots of fish guys, and as u can see, some big ones too. have fun!"
395380,Victor,2009-10-22 12:51:00,1609,it depends what you primarily target. Hamilton has an amazing carp fishery and i believe that's what most people are after under the skyway bridge.
395459,wolfville,2009-10-22 17:29:00,396, 58 lb carp? do you mind me asking when this was? and if the fish was actually weighed? Catching one of those would make me a very very happy man.
395537,craigdritchie,2009-10-22 22:11:00,1586,"Take a walk down the ship canal piers in May and you'll see pods of absolutely enormous carp swimming around. I have no idea what they would weigh, but some of them are big enough you could ride them."
395541,fishinguypat,2009-10-22 22:24:00,547,bronte salmon run is  over if you want to try for steelhead go up now or to erindale park on the credit...the seeds have been planted
395592,uglyfish,2009-10-23 00:04:00,981,  2 or 3 years ago i believe. and yes it was weighed. it was an absolute BEAST
395861,Sudzy,2009-10-23 20:16:00,88,Anyone else have any shore spots in the burlington area?
396147,pikehunter,2009-10-25 07:36:00,1659," If they ever finish building the pier you may have a great place to   fish, what a fiasco! spectator story project update 2008 What a bargain, a dock for only 8 million dollars"
396423,fishermccann,2009-10-26 14:10:00,655,yes I may be wrong  but is the record not 55lbs. ?
396442,uglyfish,2009-10-26 14:57:00,981,"  could very well be... really not sure. the fish was a live release anyways. i dont think the gentleman who caught it was thinkin about any records, he was just ecstatic to catch a fish like that. wouldnt be the first time a record fish was released back to the water instead of being certified as a record."
396814,wolfville,2009-10-27 19:21:00,396," I believe the official Ontario record for carp is still at 30 something lb, and much bigger fish are caught every year. The problem is, most people catching those fish would not kill the fish for a record. I wouldn't anyway."
