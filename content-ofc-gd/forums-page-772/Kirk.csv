396691,pikehunter,2009-10-27 07:15:00,1659,Just noticed a topic requesting a lawyer and it made me think of Kirk. I haven't seen him around for some time and was missing his posts. I checked his profile and the last time he was seen was April/09.  Getting kind of quiet around OFC without the long time members showing up all that much anymore.
