396054,Leecher,2009-10-24 19:31:00,7832,Here's a step by step video on how to make your own wooden spook for those that are interested.  It's kind of hard to shoot footage by yourself and narrate it but I think I did OK..... you be the judge  I tried to keep it as short as possible but unfortunately the video got over 100MB in size..... Not much I can do about that Hope you enjoy Leechman     Here's another link if it doesn't work  
396056,misfish,2009-10-24 19:34:00,29133,Not working bud.
396059,Leecher,2009-10-24 19:38:00,7832, Click on the play button at the bottom left and let me know....  works for me
396065,misfish,2009-10-24 19:51:00,29133,"Good job. I know the hand workmenship is what it,s all about,but a lathe,belt sander would be quicker.LOL   I was clicking on the top play arrow."
396075,Leecher,2009-10-24 20:50:00,7832, Thanks Brian!!!  Yes there are better tools out there to speed up the process but I don't own any of it.... so I have to build with what I have  First time posting an embedded video and the bottom left play button is the only one working for me!!! Jacques
396080,mojobass,2009-10-24 21:32:00,34,"Hey Leechman, You are so creative with your lures and they look great! Too I don't have that kind of patience. Thanks for sharing."
396100,Fishnwire,2009-10-25 00:45:00,983,"That's really awesome.  I'm going to try something like that for sure.  There are a couple of things about your spook that differs from the original though.  Trying to incorporate them might really improve performance.  First of all, the eyelet on the original is not actually located at the tip of the nose.  It is offset a few millimeters and actually points off at about a 45 degree angle.  Secondly the original spook is weighted near the tail end, usually incorporating a rattle.  Lastly, and this would be the hardest thing to accomplish, the original is actually tapered slightly from head to tail.  The good folks at Heddon probably wouldn't have bothered with those details if they didn't make a difference.  Nice work...let us know how you make out on the water."
396107,Dabluz,2009-10-25 01:16:00,701,What kind of wood?  Do you use some kind of primer on the bare wood?
396117,irishfield,2009-10-25 01:51:00,26272,Ever thought of starting with a dowel Leechman!  Sorry... I couldn't resist!  ...now can you get one here by morning so I can try it out??  Some great work there fella!
396146,Fishnwire,2009-10-25 07:04:00,983,"Here's a close-up look at how the eyelet is attached on the original.  As you can see, it doesn't extend straight out from the nose but points down a little.    You seem to have things figured out pretty good...you obviously don't need my advice.  Have fun and good luck."
396162,Greencoachdog,2009-10-25 12:09:00,8163,"That was great Jacques!!!  Don't listen to Brian and Wayne, lathes and dowel are for old weak men and sissies!!!  Your lures show a great deal of craftmanship!... you should've been a carpenter!!!"
396172,limeyangler,2009-10-25 13:50:00,5204,"Great video Jacques,  I would be inspired to do something similar, however....lol....i spend too much time fishing!  By the way...you sound australian...lol...just kidding...i get that all the time.  Thanks for putting that together."
396179,Greencoachdog,2009-10-25 14:22:00,8163, Both of y'all talk funny!!!  ... I sure am glad I don't talk funny!
396207,Leecher,2009-10-25 16:36:00,7832," Thanks mojobass!!!  It certainly require some type of patience for making them lures..... just got to take it one step at a time   Thanks Fishnwire!!!   Those are good points you bring forward comparing my version and the original.... I don't own an original,  only seen it a couple of times..... that is what I remember seeing.  I could always split the piece in half and using my router table, create a pocket in the middle and insert ball bearings to get the rattle noise and then glue it together.  Won't have much time testing it cause deer season is upon us up here and next Saturday is opening day.... but next softwater season will give it a try for sure.   It's white pine and don't use any primer other than white water based paint on the first coat.  Then add color and a couple of coats of varnish to seal it."
396213,Leecher,2009-10-25 17:02:00,7832, Thanks Wayne!!!  Yes a dowel would cut down on the sanding time for sure.  I'm using the cutouts of the tipups I made last year.... I just could not let them go to waste  Shoot me a PM with your home address and I would be more then happy to send you one..... but I don't think it would get there that fast LOL  You could always take off in your plane and land in Gatineau airport if you want  But I wouldn't recommend it today.... winds are from the west at 28km/h    Thanks again Fishnwire!!!  Yes I see it now.... maybe the next batch   Thanks Glen!!!  Hope you get your Christmas gift before I leave for deer hunting!!!   Thanks Simon!!! Yes I know I talk funny in front of the camera LOL  but I'm a Quebec pure bread with some inglaise speaking   What you talking about
396238,snag,2009-10-25 19:05:00,1932,I'd be happy to test a few  Great job!
396241,Leecher,2009-10-25 19:16:00,7832, Thanks Grant!!!  Shoot me a PM with your coordinates and....... well you know the rest
396268,Dabluz,2009-10-25 21:15:00,701,I may make a few myself.  Some really big ones for pike and some really small ones for brook trout.  I think I will drill a hole from one end to the other and pass a strong wire from the eye to the rear hook.  Maybe even make another hole so that I can pass the wire through a wire loop for the belly hook and then fill up the holes with epoxy.
396271,Leecher,2009-10-25 21:30:00,7832,  Never tried the wire method before and sounds like a good idea..... Good luck with your project Dabluz  Please post your results when you make some... I'd like to see them!!!
