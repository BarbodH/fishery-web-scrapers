396206,JohnF,2009-10-25 16:35:00,3494,Are you going from home? Why not cross at Ft.Erie?  Then head west to Penn and go south on 79.  Detroit seems like a long way off course.  JF
396210,Guest skeeter99,2009-10-25 16:42:00,0,"  seems like it,  done the other route and way more traffic and road issues less distance but more time  i75 more distance less time"
396211,JohnF,2009-10-25 16:51:00,3494," The sand bailout ramps scared ya, huh?  You're probably right. I just did the I-75 run too many times and started looking for new scenery. Of course I'm not hauling a boat trailer.  JF"
396212,Guest skeeter99,2009-10-25 16:56:00,0,"  reason asking is when crossing the bridge last year neither your gps or mapbook saved you cause of all the construction in detroit as the border, got off track went in to store (bad idea)  then got mauled by the locals for money!!!  wife did not like the situation, and thank god I had a ten spot on me LOL!!!"
396219,OhioFisherman,2009-10-25 17:37:00,6623,Just came back from Florida about a month and a half ago all the way down 75 once I got off I -71 there was a little construction but nothing too bad.
396229,JohnF,2009-10-25 18:14:00,3494,I like crossing at Pt.Huron then taking 94 all the way out to the airport before turning south on 275. Saves driving on the bumpy section of I75 although perhaps they've finally paved it. I know it's a longer drive but it sure is nicer than I-75 thru Detroit. You finally hit 75 down at Monroe (kinda near the Cabela's store at Dundee too.  JF
396289,Handlebarz,2009-10-25 23:54:00,3790,Yes the Bridge is flowing great I cross it everyday and you can get on 75 SB from it the HWY is open right through Detroit now
396299,Greencoachdog,2009-10-26 00:24:00,8163,"If you're going ""Spot"" hunting on Lanier, don't forgrt your white buzz bait... and don't be afraid to throw it at a likely looking structure 10 times!  If the water temp is below 65*F, use a white spinnerbait or Threadfin shad imitation for then ""Spots"" and a purple worm forn the largies!  ... but if you want it to feel more like home, you can always fish below the dam for stocked rainbow trout with canned corn!"
396369,Dutchy,2009-10-26 04:09:00,416," Tons of construction on I79 between Erie and Pitt. Down to one lane in either direction in alot of places. With all the trucks, its pretty slow going.  Dutchy"
