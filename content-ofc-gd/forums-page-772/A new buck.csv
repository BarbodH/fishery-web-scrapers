395993,misfish,2009-10-24 15:59:00,29133,"This weather is nuts.Cold ,wind, rain,then warm. No wonder the deer only come out at night.      Nice tyns on this boy.      Remember that 6 point? He came back. Is that a growth on his chest?The 8 point doesnt have it.  "
395995,Sinker,2009-10-24 16:04:00,8692,Nice bucks Brian!! That last one looks like its got something growing there for sure.  Good luck getting one! Are you baiting that spot? I find bait makes them go noctournal!  S.
395998,misfish,2009-10-24 16:13:00,29133,No bait there Shane. I did finally lay some doe urine down on Monday when I was out.Not the cheap stuff either.The real stuff I get from the wolfs den.
396001,misfish,2009-10-24 16:21:00,29133,Heres a closer look at it Shane.  
396002,richyb,2009-10-24 16:26:00,774,That new buck sure looks like a dandy . Cant wait to see the picks of him with a hole in his shoulder.
396005,bucktail,2009-10-24 16:41:00,1857,"Nice buck Brian, Thought itmight be starting to rut up but still looks a few weeks away. I have to get a trail cam, its amazing what travels at night that we dont see   Darren"
396035,Skud,2009-10-24 18:04:00,739,Beauty big Buck in your neighborhood now Brian. We will have to wait for the rut before those big guys get dumb enough to poke around during daylight.  I am starting to get doe pics during the day now.
396038,richyb,2009-10-24 18:11:00,774,The first 2 pics look like a 10 point.
396039,edmichit,2009-10-24 18:27:00,145,"I thought the first one looked more like a 10 then an 8 at first as well. The growth on the 6pnt is like nothing ive seen before on a deer...very odd, he also looks kinda skinny for a mature deer."
396045,misfish,2009-10-24 18:56:00,29133,"Good call. 10 point.  Guess you can call it buck crazy fever.LOL  Yeah Doug,it will take that male horny thing to get them.  Still have does aswell.        And still sniff,n that area.    And that yote made an appearance.  "
