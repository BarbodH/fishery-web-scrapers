I'm looking for some new material to add to a collection of fun cartoons I'm illustrating for an upcoming publication and greeting card collection of wacky outdoor experiences. (By the way, I've got a ton of material about developers, angry residents and trailer parks!  ) No blood and guts or gore, just fun stuff! Thanks for your help! Cheers! "
