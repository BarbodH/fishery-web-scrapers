699978,Joeytier,2012-05-27 03:40:00,3990,"Got out for some small stream speckles this weekend.  With low, warm water and hot, hot air, I was surprised to find fish so active, but they were bangin'!  Extensive bush whacking was in order, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  Keeps those pesky people away.  The horse flies on the other hand...  As per usual, the faster, riffle water produced most smaller fish while plugging away at deep slow log jams, waiting to hit that perfect cast was usually the ticket for the bigger specimens.  Black or brown bead head nymphs free-drifted under a small indicator brought all fish to the bank.  Missed 2 real hogs while poppin' a muddler right before sundown.   Excuse to go back I suppose         Anyone who has fished small specks will agree that keeping a small net with you is crucial to properly handle trout.  Next on the list is to acquire a smaller, shorter 2 or 3 wt. to get into some spots I haven't yet been able to penetrate with my 6 wt."

699995,adolson,2012-05-27 05:40:00,783,"Very nice, Joey! I've got about four or five creeks I have planned to try, so hopefully I'll catch a few of these babies myself. I'll be sure to pick up a small net like that first."
700024,mirogak,2012-05-27 12:20:00,387,Those are nice little brookies. I am also on the hunt to find some creeks/streams around my area that house these babies.
700026,Roy,2012-05-27 12:31:00,13728,Very nice Joey! Thanks for sharing. Such a beautiful fish they are.
700031,Ralph Field,2012-05-27 12:42:00,1018,Those are truly magnificent looking brookies and well worth your effort to capture them.
700308,GreenCanada,2012-05-28 01:41:00,375,"Awesome photos, but I'm sure pictures don't do the colours justice. Definitely my favourite species of fish!  Great report!  Tightlines!"
700366,spincast,2012-05-28 09:30:00,3279,"nice reward for your efforts - they are a good loooking fish, and lots of fun on light tackle."
700371,Rod Caster,2012-05-28 11:00:00,5784,"At least those horeflies donet leave garbage on the creek bank, eh?  I'll have to get your opinion on an UL spinning outfit for myself for bushwacking. Either that or aybe you convince me to get into fly fishing."
700378,Jacob,2012-05-28 11:46:00,186,"Great looking fish, nothing beats small stream brookies."
700387,Gregoire,2012-05-28 12:28:00,1397,I am seriously getting jealous of these brook trout posts. One of these days I'll get a reel for the 4wt rod my brother built me and I'll hit up some streams.
700524,Joeytier,2012-05-28 20:31:00,3990,"This area hardly even has a visible trail once the underbrush comes up, yet I still happen upon garbage bags and pieces of furniture...  Let me know if you're serious about picking up a fly combo...I'll be selling the one I caught these fish on in a week or two."
