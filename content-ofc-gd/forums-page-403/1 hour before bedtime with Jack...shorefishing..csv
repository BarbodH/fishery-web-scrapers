We headed to a sheltered lake i know for an hour shore fishing and some fresh, albeit cold and wet, air.  Nice way to end the day. Dont know what was with my camera settings tonight...but the pictures sucked...you get the idea though.     <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/kQDM3-AjBjc"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                                 "
