700223,Pipefighter,2012-05-27 22:42:00,29,  well it was our first trip to quinte and it was  pretty good . The first day we killed the pickerel bunch of sheep head and a pike or 2 . (lotsof small perch)  trolling slow with worm harnesses worked good.nothing too big in size but good eaters.             ill let the old man hold my fish i guess lol         winner and still champion

700239,spincast,2012-05-27 23:20:00,3279,"great way to spend a couple days. That first pic just begs for steak, walleye filets, a beer and good friends / or family. Looks like you covered most of the bases."
700292,Kayakmike,2012-05-28 01:17:00,20,"We just got back from Quinte....and you are right about the the walleye wanting worms...very few caught on artificial offerings.  Of course, perch and white bass and sheepshead were all competing for same worm...enough to make you go bonkers at times.  This year seemed to be a little tougher fishing than in previous years....we did ok but not the quantity of good bites as we had in previous years....nevertheless the walleye we caught were great in the frying pan!!  Quinte is an absolutely gorgeous area....looking forward to going back!"
