700229,Broker,2012-05-27 23:02:00,482,"Hello everyone. I have been in search for a way to catch any type of trout in the Haldimand area. Kinda wanting to use the fly rod on some as I am new to fly fishing. So I am not looking for any specific hotspots or honey holes, But I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction for some trout in the Haldimand area? Thanks"
700237,Musky or Specks,2012-05-27 23:14:00,2710,Basically if its flowing water in Haldimand it has trout. If you want to try flyfishing the creek right in the Park in Simcoe is loaded with brookies.
700271,Broker,2012-05-28 00:35:00,482,"Really? I had no idea that that creek had any fish in it! You say any flowing water in haldimand, is that excluding the Grand between york and erie ?"
700281,Musky or Specks,2012-05-28 00:56:00,2710,Well yes but only spring and fall. I was talking the smaller streams and creeks. Haldimand/Norfolk is blessed with the perfect geological deposit. The Sandplain. The same soil that allows the area to grow tobacco and ginseng also makes great trout streams. If you PM me what your looking to do maybe I'll point you in the right direction. But like I said almost every creek down there has trout.
700323,dave524,2012-05-28 02:40:00,4508,The old Norfolk County has a lot more trout streams than Haldimand County.
700325,Musky or Specks,2012-05-28 02:45:00,2710,Yes it does but we've always referred to them as Haldimand/Norfolk Sandplain streams.
