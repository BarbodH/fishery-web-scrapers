700727,rmarentette,2012-05-29 12:13:00,124,"WINDSOR, Ont. -- The $17.5 million in federal funding announced Monday to protect the Great Lakes from Asian carp is a good investment, University of Windsor professor and aquatic invasive species expert Hugh MacIsaac said Monday.  ""It's one of these things where an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"" MacIsaac said.  If the large fish got into the Great Lakes and reproduced prolifically they would hurt native fish populations and could even hurt boaters or jet skiers if the silver carp, which jump out of the water making for YouTube highlights, invade the Great Lakes, he said of a worst-case scenario.  ""We don't want to find out.""  Fisheries and Oceans Canada Minister Keith Ashfield announced $17.5 million over five years for prevention, early warning, rapid response, and management and control of Asian carp.  ""The Great Lakes is the largest freshwater system in the world and represents one of Canada's most valuable assets,"" Ashfield said in a release Monday.  ""We are committed to working with our American counterparts to continue to protect the Great Lakes basin. Together these measures will go a long way toward our ultimate goal of stopping Asian carp from entering and becoming established in the Great Lakes.""  © Copyright © The Windsor Star Read more: http://www.windsorst...l#ixzz1wGBRU6bv"
