Shirt over PFD.    First,we had to give a jig for a whitie for team 1. Lots of action on the finder.Hook up with one,half way up,,,,,,,,,,,,sorry team 1,it went bye bye  . We continued for about another hour with nothing,but a herring to show for it. Watched  the guys rigg,n and not many rods going off. Hmmm,maybe they dont have it down right. So we put away the jigg,n sticks and start rigg,n. Same depths,spoons and speed, as the past weekend. They werent doing anything wrong,the bite was just off.  We trolled from 8:30am til 11 am,with not even a sniff. Then at 11:30 I get hooked up with a small one. (Terry has the pic) Half hour later,Terry gets into a real nice one.   <object style=""height: 390px; width: 640px""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaZbrIfbg7Q?version=3&feature=player_detailpage""><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaZbrIfbg7Q?version=3&feature=player_detailpage""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""><param name=""allowScriptAccess"" value=""always""><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaZbrIfbg7Q?version=3&feature=player_detailpage"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allowScriptAccess=""always"" width=""640"" height=""360""></object>  Nice fish buddy     With every other boat gone,we figured we would end the day with that nice fish.  Thanks again for the time on the water bud. Fun as always. Maybe we need to go looking for walters."

699920,spincast,2012-05-26 21:20:00,3279,"nice day to be on the water and a couple sweet ones to show for it - although it looks like Terry's fish is comin for a kiss Brian... Sure beats mulching the garden, putting the deck back together, cutting the grass..... and so on. But now the brownie cupboard is full and off to lake O at 4:00 is back on the schedule - if mother nature is gracious enough   prermitting"
700183,Scott S,2012-05-27 21:35:00,203,"It was slow for us too Brian. Went out after 1pm, my son had a hockey tryout in the morning. Followed what you told me and had one knockoff. Had the screen light up a couple of times but no takers. Must have been that east wind. That's my story anyways Scooter"
700189,misfish,2012-05-27 21:45:00,29133,"Ah, the hockey try-outs. Been there,done that, for 9 years with the boys. Dont miss it. Good luck to your son."
