Paul (tybo) and I made the our way out for some lakers and whities on Simcoe today. Our plan was to down rig for lakers,and the odd white,then head for some jigg,n whities. Well,we never made it to jigg,n whities,as the LAKERS,kept us busy all day.   It was a bit of a wait,but once we found them,it was game on. The hatch of bugs were not so nice,but with the rods going off,we paid no attention.  I was responsible of the rigg,n,and Paul took care of the driving,and watching the finder.  hey paul,whats the depth,125.Ok drop to 115. Hey paul,WHAT.Whats the depth,110. This happened all day.  Once we found them,it was,,,,,,,,,,,,,well here ya go,,,,,,,,,,, We went 10 for 11 today.
