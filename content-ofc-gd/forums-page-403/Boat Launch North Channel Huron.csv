I would like to take my fiance rainbow fishing there, we went to southbaymouth last year and had a great day.  I understand the fishing in the channel is even better and not as far a drive for us.   Does anyone know where I could launch my boat off Okeechobee road?  Also, anyone know how the rainbows are biting in the channel.  Any suggestions or tips would be welcome.  Thanks to all.  Millhouse"
