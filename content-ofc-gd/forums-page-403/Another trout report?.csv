700242,Christopheraaron,2012-05-27 23:25:00,3525,"Left the house at 7:30 this morning, got to the river at 8:30, planned to fish the whole day for brookies and browns with spinners and small nymphs.  5 minutes in and FISH ON! Ya, fish on but not what I wanted, just a small chub, followed by 2 more.  Headed downstream through a thick forest of ferns, into a nice deep pool, after an hour of chucking mepps through the pools with no results ( and one lost lure ) I decided it was time to move again.  Now downstream I find the best looking area yet, more chub on flies so I threw the mepps around again, nothing. Switched to dries, again nothing, took a silt sample with my trout net and found some larvae, tied on a prince nymph and got my trout! A little 5 inch brown, and then back to the chub.  Good day, 1 trout, nice area but I don't think I'm going back to that spot for a while.    "
700246,limeyangler,2012-05-27 23:29:00,5204,Nice one.  Cant really see the pics though...very small.  Ever considered a Photobucket account?...its free.
700248,Christopheraaron,2012-05-27 23:32:00,3525,"Not really, no, the pics are from my phone and I can't get them any bigger."
700258,Musky or Specks,2012-05-27 23:50:00,2710,Generally if the chubb are hitting the water is to warm for trout fishing. It one of the signs I look for also if the dang smallmouth are hitting.

700270,Christopheraaron,2012-05-28 00:34:00,3525,"Thanks, it was either that or sunfish, and that one little trout was defiantly worth it."
700274,Joey,2012-05-28 00:53:00,9122,"Well you got out and caught something, that's a great day in my books"
