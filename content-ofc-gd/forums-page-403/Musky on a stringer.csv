700007,Roy,2012-05-27 11:14:00,13728,"As others have said, really great that you were able to capture that. Thanks for showing it.  You do know that it's illegal to use walleye for bait eh?"
700008,MCTFisher9120,2012-05-27 11:21:00,3761,"Crazy video, haha too cool. Nice walleye btw"
700010,Rich Clemens,2012-05-27 11:29:00,3131,Really Cool.  She wasn't gonna give up that meal.
700034,Blue Lk,2012-05-27 13:05:00,337,"Really Cool Simon,1rst thought was,just like Swamp People,was waiting for Troy to shout ""soot soot"""
700053,icefisherman,2012-05-27 14:15:00,952,"Well Simon,  I knew you are kind and polite gentleman but this was taking it too far my friend  Asking so politely that musky so many times to give your fish back was a like a text book example of a polite Canadian behaviour ha ha ha  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
700059,Handlebarz,2012-05-27 14:33:00,3790,Awesome simon thanks for sharing
700066,otter649,2012-05-27 15:05:00,118,Neat video never had a Musky try & steal my stringer just a big snapping turtle.....
700073,woodenboater,2012-05-27 16:02:00,2277,"Great video and the musky was just so calm the whole time ! A very ""don't mind me while I grab some lunch off your stringer' kind of attitude lol. I couldn't quite tell however, but did the musky finally let go or did it swallow the walleye whole ?"
700076,adempsey,2012-05-27 16:13:00,1498,Very cool.  Makes you think twice about relieving yourself off the side of the boat too!!
700078,limeyangler,2012-05-27 16:16:00,5204,Thanks for the replies      I thought that was only illegal on a Thursday afternoon. Jeeze...they really make the regs so complicated!    I just gave the stringer a gentle shake and it eventually let go.
700086,lovetofish,2012-05-27 16:35:00,500,Cool video!  Can't believe he wouldn't let it go.
700107,Billy Bob,2012-05-27 18:01:00,5865,"Just another reason not use a stringer, eh........(only on fly in trips do I use a stringer)  Nice video BTW......"
700182,spincast,2012-05-27 21:30:00,3279,Very cool Simon ................... so did you Waypoint that spot?
700275,fishboy,2012-05-28 00:53:00,550,that was awesome-thanks for sharing..I've only ever had a snapper go after a stringer
700382,Jacob,2012-05-28 12:02:00,186,"That's a huge fish, great video."
700388,limeyangler,2012-05-28 12:28:00,5204,  absolutely...its between a rock and a hard place!
700391,jigsnreels,2012-05-28 12:42:00,133, Don't think there's much out there that would spook a musky...  :-)  I once caught a pike the same way when I was a kid.  It attacked our stringer and I just yanked the whole thing out of the water.  He soon occupied the spot right next to his would-be meal.  Both were delicious.
700398,limeyangler,2012-05-28 12:53:00,5204,"   LOL...poetic justice.   I have this little clip from the same bay a week ago.....Pike vs Pike.   The fish were hungry there this week.      <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/YBRl6dsP2rQ"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"

699919,lew,2012-05-26 21:15:00,12766,You need to clip a big 7/0 treble on the end of that stringer Simon
699930,mike rousseau,2012-05-26 21:54:00,4661,Had that happen here...  Broke a clip right of my stringer...

699992,Ben_Daniels,2012-05-27 05:16:00,435,"That was awesome Simon, thanks for sharing! Probably a good decision not trying to pick it up. He was lethargic with a fish in his mouth but something tells me he would have gone nuts having his dinner(or your dinner lol) taken away and being picked up! Could have hurt either one of you!  -Ben"
700004,Musky or Specks,2012-05-27 11:02:00,2710,Very cool.I'm the same way with my dinner.Won't let go of it either.
