700145,muskymatt,2012-05-27 20:29:00,2608,"First time in the boat this season, I took a couple buds out to the Big Rideau and was hoping to hook up on some lakers. Boat wwas in top shape but the downriggers were a bit off, I think it's rebuild time.  Neither of my buds had ever caught a Lake Trout before so I was hoping to have a couple firsts in the boat. The lakers didn't disappoint.  We went 4 for 4 with the biggest going back into the drink.(too big to eat)   Ians first laker ever   Another decent one , fought hard, couldn't find my ""Leafs suck"" shirt so had to go with the ""Go Sens Go"" shirt!   Good times on the water but boy it got hot fast, had to get off early.  Can't wait to get back out for some for the smoker!"
700154,Terry,2012-05-27 20:49:00,14456,nice going   I have not fished that spot in about 10 years
700175,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 21:20:00,4661,sweet catch...  never got a laker either...  looks like a fun time...
700251,limeyangler,2012-05-27 23:35:00,5204,nice lakers.  thanks for sharing
700266,MCTFisher9120,2012-05-28 00:30:00,3761,Very nice Lake Trout!  Thanks for sharing
700278,Joey,2012-05-28 00:55:00,9122,Sweet trout.  Looks like you all had a good time.  That sun can kill ya sometimes.  I hate when it drives us off the lake!
700364,spincast,2012-05-28 09:26:00,3279,nice shooting - a fine collection of fish there. Bimini tops are the cats meow on days lake that - although they do make casting or using 10 ft dispey rods really difficult in a small boat.
700377,Jacob,2012-05-28 11:42:00,186,Great fish.
700406,johnnyb,2012-05-28 13:21:00,3413,Beautiful lakers....what was the hot bait?
700418,Live2fish85,2012-05-28 13:49:00,1633,Nice work. Those are some nice Lakers you got.
700466,muskymatt,2012-05-28 16:29:00,2608," 2 came on 3"" williams silver wobblers with silver flash tape on 1/2, 1 came on a 3"" silver mooselook and 1 came on a 5"" silver williams whitefish spoon. All fish came out of 50'-60' of water in 150' depth"
700627,RickOnt,2012-05-29 00:10:00,669,Hey Matt  Great report Looks like a very FUN day!!  Do you ever use Dipsys to run the 50' level?  Rick
700632,muskymatt,2012-05-29 00:32:00,2608, I haven't used dipsys in over 10 years to be honest. I just like to fool proof of the downriggers
