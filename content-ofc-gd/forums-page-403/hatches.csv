699612,Christopheraaron,2012-05-25 21:03:00,3525,"Due to the weird weather this year I am not trusting any hatch charts, I know that the gnats are out and dragonflies, someone reported seeing caddisflies but are they in full swing or just starting out? I think all of the fly fishers that aren't so good at recognizing and finding these insects could greatly benefit from this."

699709,BillM,2012-05-26 00:09:00,17367,Really dependent on the rivers themselves..  I've seen stuff hatching for the past 3-4 weeks.
699728,Christopheraaron,2012-05-26 01:24:00,3525,"Lately I've been focusing most of my efforts on the upper credit and upper humber, so probably similar to your area."
699891,northernpike56,2012-05-26 19:10:00,717," I know you're fly fishing, but, last summer I caught a few brown trout in the humber with mepps #0 and 1 spinners, you might wanna try that sometime"
700181,Christopheraaron,2012-05-27 21:27:00,3525,"Just got back from the humber, mepps did nothing but get hung up in trees, roe didn't work so I resorted to fly fishing, got a little brown TROUT on a brassie and lots of chub. Pics are to come. Also the dragonfly and damselfly larvae are everywhere!"
700187,Musky or Specks,2012-05-27 21:41:00,2710,Ton of caddis hatching yesterday on a river around Kearney.
700458,fish_finder,2012-05-28 15:58:00,370,"For the most part, just consider everything to be 2-3 weeks ahead of schedule.  Early season hatches are largely based on the number of days the water has been above X temperature for different species.  Hendricksons are pretty much done now aside from upper reaches of coldwater systems.  Grey fox and Green drakes are just getting started.  Sulphurs are popping up here and there as well.  Caddis are thick just about everywhere now.  Craneflies are out and about, midges as usual....  Stoneflies have begun!  Get those stimulators out!  dave"
700462,fish_finder,2012-05-28 16:10:00,370,"Here's a bit of whats going on in the bug world right now....  Grey Fox Dun    Grey Fox Spinner     Green Drake Dun Mind you, this species is on a pretty steep decline and won't be found in most streams...     Green Drake Spinner     Mottled Stonfly     Craneflies  "
700519,misfish,2012-05-28 20:24:00,29133,"I seen some of those crane flies on Sunday. Didnt know what they were til now. Thanks.  So when I want to buy flies,I just buy them buy the name of the real fly,correct?"
700526,BillM,2012-05-28 20:32:00,17367,"Brian, did you check out the dry fly assortment on Reelflies.ca?"
700530,davey buoy,2012-05-28 20:36:00,5505,"How about a fly/insect handbook,to identify fly's to a tee. Maybe overkill I guess. B,I hope you teach me everything you know!lol."
700533,BillM,2012-05-28 20:43:00,17367,This is a great starter dryfly kit..  http://www.reelflies.ca/45_Dry_Fly_Selection_p/dry-selection.htm
700547,davey buoy,2012-05-28 20:56:00,5505, That's a heck of a deal Bill. I will look into it myself once I get a day or three under my belt.
700553,misfish,2012-05-28 21:07:00,29133,"Thanks Bill. Booked marked. I,ll be looking at it later."
700714,BillM,2012-05-29 11:26:00,17367,"I've got a pretty big selection of dries, let me know when you wanna get out.  We'll get you into some fish ontop!"
