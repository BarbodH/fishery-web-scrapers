700119,Gerritt,2012-05-27 19:00:00,6129,I thought Lloyd kept his boat in Picton. ??? Saw it being trailered trough Brighton today... along Hwy 2...  Does he also guide Brighton Bay?  G
700121,Grimace,2012-05-27 19:06:00,2020,He also guides Salmon on Lake Ontario out of Port Hope (I believe).  Probably just in transport from one to the other I would think.
700122,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 19:06:00,4661,i believe he fishes out of port hope for salmon most of the summer and just in picton spring and fall for walleye....
