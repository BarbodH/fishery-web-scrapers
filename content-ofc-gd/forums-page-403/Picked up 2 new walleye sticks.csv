The wife loves to fish as well, so I always have to buy 2 of everything lol!  Anyways, I'm looking for 2 good casting reels with flipping switches 1 left hand 1 right hand. I've kinda of settled on the Quantum Accurist PT from reviews I've read, but I can't find them anywhere.  Anybody know of a store who has the in stock for a decent price?"
