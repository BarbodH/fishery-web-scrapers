692976,RangerGuy,2012-05-04 14:55:00,564,"I agree this has nothing to do with Lund and really the only issue I have with the dealer is they took so long to figure it out. I found out in 3 hours, I'm sure they will make it right I spoke with them last night and they are to call me sometime today.  As for waiting, I think we are just gonna go with the merc.. as I have had 1 dealer say 3-4 months and another say they can't get a date yet and finally one which is a 5 star yamaha dealer say that yamaha told them they can't source one from another dealer or even give a date and ussually they will tell them they are on the ship coming over or they haven't left japan yet etc.  So I will cross my fingers and hope that the Opti is reliable :S  If the dealer is willing to loan a used motor or allow me to use the motor that come default on the boat until the yamaha comes in then I might do that, I forgot to ask that yesterday.I will see what they think of that idea.  I'll keep everyone posted."
692978,dave524,2012-05-04 14:59:00,4508,"If there is a 90 tiller available, I would not for 1 sec hesitiate to go with that, they are essentially the same engine, same weight, block, lower end from what I can see. Would not do it if it was an increase in weight/displacement though. Externally the only diff is the decal saying 75HP. The 75 is a detuned 90 or the 90 is a tuned up 75, take your pick"
692980,Lunkerhunter,2012-05-04 15:07:00,455,i ordered a new princecraft with a 115 merc on it... it was supposed to be ready last week.. boat came in and is ready however the motor has been delayed. apparently should be in for next weekend but this thread has me wondering. i sure hope everything goes as planned.
693191,esoxansteel,2012-05-05 02:34:00,1307,"  Angleo Lombardo was the rep for Lund, but he has taken over Mike Readers job at OFAH, but would have some very good contacts for you no doubt."
693223,ecmilley,2012-05-05 10:56:00,2163,if i have learned anything about boats and snowmobiles is that nothing is ever ready when it's promised. nobody likes to wait and it's a match made in heaven for a yamaha and a lund
693850,ohhenrygsr,2012-05-07 16:12:00,947,"We had this problem a years ago. Every dealer usually puts in there order of outboards before year end. But no one ever projects a substantial increase in sales for the future. We had a problem ordering 115hp 4-strokes last year due to the crises happing around the world. This year Mercury came out with the brand new 150HP 4-Stroke, they built 7000 units but had orders for 20,000 units YIKES! I'm sure your dealer is trying their best to get the product to the consumer but sometimes their will be delays. A boat purchase is something everyone will own for a lifetime. Just like fishing it requires patience. I'm sure you will enjoy your brand new Lund for years to come."
694194,RangerGuy,2012-05-08 13:03:00,564,"Well,  Spoke to the dealer yesterday. Looks like I should have the boat early June now instead of mid May. If they stick to this timeline that won't be to bad I guess.  I'm still not sure I'm happy with the price with an opti it's only about $200 less than the yamaha. I was expecting to see a larger price difference between the yamaha and mercury optimax but I have no way of confirming that.  This could be the cost of the Big Tiller handle. In my mind Mercury is soaking customers for the cost of the power steering and variable troll control options. If you want the power steering option it's an extra $3,000 OUCH!  Dealer is telling me to have the variable troll control I have to have the Smart Gauge package which is like $1000 extra.  For that price I'll use drift socks, it's to bad because that comes by default with the yamaha.  I think I will talk with them more about the price when the boat comes in.  So here's the final product list  -1800 Lund Alaskan Tiller -75 HP Mercury Optimax -Big Tiller Handle -Wetlands Camo Package -Extra matching Seat -Extra matching seat base -Cockpit cover -Shorelander trailer -Load guides -Spare Tire"
694237,ohhenrygsr,2012-05-08 15:05:00,947,Nice Package. The big tiller handle is a huge improvement over the years.
694238,Raf,2012-05-08 15:15:00,3495,"I think you're nuts for abandoning the Yammy and only saving a few bucks.  Not that the merc is a bad motor, far from it.  The troll assist feature is real nice on my 40 yammy, I bet with the big 75 it'd be even nicer.  Sure, waiting for the yammy sucks but you buy this boat and it lasts you for years..several weeks now is really a minor inconveniece in the grand scheme of things.(unless you have money riding on prompt delivery).  Just my 0.02c."
694242,RangerGuy,2012-05-08 15:21:00,564,"Just got a call directly from Yamaha. They are saying mid - june, now I don't know what to do"
694244,BillM,2012-05-08 15:22:00,17367,"Mid june is a month away, it's not even bass opener yet.   I'd wait for the Yamaha.  In the grand scheme of things, what's an extra month?"
694247,lew,2012-05-08 15:29:00,12766," Sit back and wait RG, the 4 stroke Yamaha is a fantastic motor and you'll be extremely happy you stuck it out for another couple weeks."
694249,RangerGuy,2012-05-08 15:30:00,564,I think i'm gonna wait for the yamaha..  Dealer is going hate me.. as they just re-worked the whole order for the opti LOL!...  but hey..I'm not the one that took a month to find out the motor was delayed.
694250,tb4me,2012-05-08 15:30:00,3295,"Id wait it out too, I wouldnt be happy thou...."
694274,craigdritchie,2012-05-08 16:29:00,1586,"Part of the reason for the delay could be your choice of a 75 Yamaha. Since Yamaha introduced their new 70 hp four-stroke two years ago, it has pretty much replaced the 75. You might want to ask about availability on the 70 - they sell a ton of them, so it might be faster than the older 75."
694280,RangerGuy,2012-05-08 16:54:00,564,"Yeh they have them available, but it is a 60 which is pushed to 70. From what I read it's the same lower unit etc.. I've also read some reviews about slower hole shot etc with the 70 probably do to the smaller lower unit.  The 75 is a detuned 90, I think it would have a longer lifespan because it shouldn't be working as hard. I could be wrong ..i'm just a backyard mechanic LOL!"
694283,Grimace,2012-05-08 16:59:00,2020,"I think it is a smart move to wait for the Yammy.   Like mentioned earlier, you will have this boat for years so a few weeks is minor.  Just think of all those years of trolling with a nice quiet four stroke over the opti."
694397,Steve Piggott,2012-05-08 23:57:00,196,"My budddy just got the call, his yammy is in Toronto. He has been waiting since March. I hope yours was on the same boat. Good luck."
694421,Gman,2012-05-09 01:02:00,126, I'm with Craig on this one as he's right. PM sent.  Cheers G.
700926,RangerGuy,2012-05-29 18:59:00,564,MY BOAT IS IN! YEHAAAA!! All rigged and ready to go.  Only concern is where they mounted my extra seat.  I specified they wait until I say where I want it. Salesman just told me they already mounted it.  He said he doesn't know why because it's right on the bill to wait for me.  Hopefully they mounted it close to where I want it or i'm gonna have patched holes in my boat floor  I will post pics when I get her home SOOO EXCITED LOL!
700935,woodenboater,2012-05-29 19:34:00,2277,  sorry to hear about the seat mount. They better make it right and then some !  looking forward to the pics
700938,cityfisher,2012-05-29 19:39:00,959,I know your pain!! My boat was supposed to arrive april.20..  Paid for a slip and everything .. now its supposed to be june.20.. Princecraft better make it right... lost a good month of fishing.
700948,Billy Bob,2012-05-29 19:52:00,5865,SWEET.....  Now go catch a fish......
692581,RangerGuy,2012-05-03 15:33:00,564,So I ordered a new Lund 1800 Alaskan with a 75 hp yamaha tiller late March. I just got a call from them saying the motor is going to take 2+ months to get. This would stretch my delivery time-frame to 4 months.  Am I being un-reasonable thinking this is rediculous that it took a month to find this out and that I have to wait 4 months for a new boat / motor combo?
692584,Pikeslayer,2012-05-03 15:36:00,1443,Being unreasonable? NO  Rediculous? YES  Might want to call the manufacturer direct. Could the dealer be having some financial issues???  Fishndevil is getting his new Yammy (see status updates). Maybe pm him??
692586,mike rousseau,2012-05-03 15:41:00,4661,id be flippin out right now if i was you... i can see a boat taking a while if its being manufactured....maybe... but the motor... there should be one somewhere they could have shipped out by now...  i would think anyways...
692587,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-03 15:46:00,10439,I would call a couple of other dealers and check availability and if they say they are available and in stock I would go to your dealer and threaten to cancel the order. Then see what happens. If they start saying they aren't available tell them you talked to some other dealers that have them in stock and watch the back peddling begin. I love watching liars squirm.     :clapping:
692588,Nipfisher,2012-05-03 15:54:00,2449,I have a Yamaha part on back order for my 90hp and it won't be in until June 8th (this is from Yamaha not the dealer). Good thing my boat is still useable. I'll wait until the part is in then bring it back to them.  Does the dealership have other Yam tillers? Maybe they could loan you one (more or less hp) until yours comes in?  A friend of mine just bought an 1875 Crossover from a dealership in Sudbury and had no issues.
692590,SmokestackLightnin,2012-05-03 15:59:00,390," The first thing I would do if I were you is change my handle, sounds like you are no longer RangerGuy. After that I would contact Yamaha to confirm what you have been told. Then I would then find out if Honda, Merc, Evinrude can do it faster and see what Yamaha is willing to do in order to keep a customer. Get the dealer to do the same. The dealer should be working on your behalf, a good dealer would have already done this."
692592,doubleheader,2012-05-03 16:02:00,497,"Generally in circumstances like these I try to give the party the benefit of the doubt, but, in this case I find it very hard to believe they have not had a part in this. I think you need to find out what is holding this up, is it the boat or the motor, when was the boat ordered, and so on. If they can get the boat I'd give consideration to hanging another motor. Let's face it, they are all pretty good motors anymore, I'd prefer the Mercury or Honda 90 tiller myself. I'd inquire about getting a down payment refund if they can't get the boat."
692611,smally21,2012-05-03 16:27:00,993,"im with the hang a different motor off it idea. each of the top manufacturers make a good product with similar performance and cost.  of course, if the dealership only represents one brand this could present a problem.  going to be a long wait with the weather this nice in april. id also look at just buying something else or somewhere else. which would be tough because you probably did lots of research and shopping, and have to start again..  good luck Lund Guy sorry to hear."
692620,Billy Bob,2012-05-03 17:06:00,5865,Can you move up to a Yammy 90 hp.....that's what I would do if your boat is rated for that HP.
692621,smally21,2012-05-03 17:11:00,993,great solution..especially if you can lean on the dealer to discount the upgrade for inconvenience.  i have no idea - do tillers come that big?
692622,RangerGuy,2012-05-03 17:12:00,564,Thanks everybody for the input  Well..  I spoke to a few dealers one called yamaha for me and they could not tell him when they could get one for him. The dealer said that he can ussually find out if the motors are on a ship coming from japan but yamaha has no idea what the status is so I guess we'll be hanging another motor on the back.  So my issue now is not getting motor but my current dealer took a month to do this.. burning all of my other options for rebates etc ....  I'm going to call them and see if they will do anything to make this right. It's clear that they just recently tried to order the yamaha instead of doing it right away. I say this because this other dealer found out for me in under 3 hours that they were severly delayed.  Next question is does anybody have a customer service number for LUND?... I want to see about switch the order to another dealer if they don't take care of me.  75HP is max rating for the tiller in my boat
692642,irishfield,2012-05-03 17:42:00,26272,"It'll take me some digging thru emails... but I'll try to find the Ontario rep for Lund (at least who was in 2007) that did some hoop jumping for me. I got the first ever 70"" Motorguide wireless out of him and a few life jackets for my troubles. I'll PM you his email when I find it."
692677,Sinker,2012-05-03 19:01:00,8692,"Your dealer also deals mercs.....have you asked them about that option?  That sucks man, I know you must be pissed!  S."
692684,tonyb,2012-05-03 19:19:00,1637,"How do companies expect to earn business with those types of timeframes?  It's one thing dreaming about getting a boat, but when you've already ordered it and that is the timeframe?  wow, that's harsh.  Hope you get it sorted out, I don't think you can really go wrong with any of the top brands.  Yamaha has a good product, but these sorts of delays on motors and parts will start to erode that confidence in their product I would think..."
692690,Headhunter,2012-05-03 19:28:00,5703,"Last year's earthquake and tsunami have really messed up a lot of Japanese companies. The supply chain in turn takes a beating, with a long trickle down effect thoughout many industries. Not too much unlike the debris now washing up on shore, on our west coast. HH"
692692,Billy Bob,2012-05-03 19:29:00,5865, Good Point....I was thinking the same thing.
692708,RangerGuy,2012-05-03 19:58:00,564,"Yeh, good point I didn't think of that either until the other shop I was talking to mentioned it.  I will say this.. It was swayed towards the yamaha and I don't feel this is yamaha's fault I feel it's the shop that sold me on it for not being on the ball for whatever reason."
692750,tb4me,2012-05-03 23:21:00,3295,Pm Henry Nguyen on here and as about a legend boat..They (lund) wouldnt get any of my business after pulling that crap stunt..Good luck no matter what you decide to do...
692758,limeyangler,2012-05-03 23:46:00,5204,Sounds like it might be quicker to head out west and beachcombe
692761,irishfield,2012-05-03 23:48:00,26272, Let's not get astray on this... it's not Lund screwing around as they'll only sell a complete package with a merc on it.. since 2007! It's the dealer not getting things in order to do the engine swap..
692764,buckster,2012-05-04 00:00:00,530,Firstly Lund has nothing to do with the availability of a yammy.  Secondly IMO legend is not even in the same league as Lund
692776,waso,2012-05-04 00:13:00,44,"I ordered a starcraft with the new 150 merc on it in march.  2 weeks ago they called, after saying it was coming at the end of the month, to say it would be delayed because of the motor until at least July.  At first they said there was nothing they could do, i asked for the showroom one, it was sold. Long story short, after a well worded e-mail I will be getting the showroom one with my upgrades (except now parts of the top are delayed until july).  Makes you wonder!"
692796,BillM,2012-05-04 00:50:00,17367,"I'd find another motor, 2 months is unacceptable."
692915,Fish4Eyes,2012-05-04 12:48:00,1022,"As unfortunate as it is, tough it out. Given Yamaha's prooven durability you will thank yourself when you get a few years on the motor."
692916,Sinker,2012-05-04 12:52:00,8692,"I would also wait it out. I think your going to have the same problem anywhere you go. 2 mos will fly by. Your dealer is a good one. You may be disappointed now, but they will come thru for you.  Still sucks, but what can you do. I'd wait for the yammy over another brand myself.  S."
