It is a place to upload pictures of your biggest catches for record keeping and maybe a little bragging.  I'm in no way affiliated with it, I  just wanted to bring some attention to it.  Tight Lines!"

699804,dave524,2012-05-26 11:32:00,4508,"My favourite growing up was always the ""Molsons"" Big Fish Contest, anyone every find an online rundown of the results of past years, I'm sure it dates back to the 50's. Dad and I entered a few but never made the top ten, was a great source of info where the big ones were before the internet."
699862,GreenCanada,2012-05-26 17:24:00,375,"Obviously this site isn't fully developed with extensive records yet! lol  This site is about showing off your big catches! If there isn't a lot submitted yet, anything over 9"" might be a record. haha  The more submissions, the more realistic the yearly records become!  "

699937,Garfisher,2012-05-26 22:46:00,229,"32"" isn't hard for a longnose gar, those are a little below average where I wade (34-35"")"
699954,danbouck,2012-05-27 00:27:00,4380,The records are a little off
