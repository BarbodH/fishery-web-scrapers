I'd like to see him hook something. I've only ever fished from boat in the Scug, but never from shore. Any advice? Thanks."
700384,ricoboxing,2012-05-28 12:10:00,398,"from shore your options are really limited. Either off of 7A with da white bucket brigade, behind the grocery store, or on the tip of scugog island."
700457,fish-miester,2012-05-28 15:51:00,864,"Well You are pretty limited, but any boat launches (try and stay out of the way of vehicles) port perry shoreline + pier , Ceserea Pier, causeway (hwy7A port perry), or the tip of the scugog island."
700591,Locnar,2012-05-28 22:55:00,645,"Thanks guys, I had a feeling it would be limited. I'll probably stay away from the white bucket brigade... Not much a fan of watching them keep any and everything. Depending on how well the fishing goes, will check out as many spots as possible.  Cheers, Mike"

700745,Locnar,2012-05-29 12:36:00,645," If you travel to bobcaygeon, there's a few around there. Little bob channel isn't bad, lots of panfish... even saw a muskie pulled out from there."
