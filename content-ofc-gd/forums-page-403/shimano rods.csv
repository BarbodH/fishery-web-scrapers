699677,Steve,2012-05-25 23:09:00,2075,"To quote Dan Thorburn, Shimano product support specialist, on Wednesday March 14, 2012:  Going forward we have moved to Wild Card on the new rod models. Same program with better service. No charge and replacement through the dealer. I realize this is not great for everyone, but for most of the customers this is a great service. No need to call or go online to place the order. No waiting for shipping or having to ship the old rod back. Xpeditor is now a one time per rod service anyways, so going to the Wild Card should not be a shock. Its also a no cost replacement vs. $100 for the current Xpeditor service.  Remember this is a service. A service can change at any time. Warranty changes would require post dating or changes to the wording on the warranty coverage. These are two different things. Given the Xpeditor changed over 2 years ago this argument is not going to change anything. The Wild Card is the future for any new models.  Edited for quoting."
699681,Jer,2012-05-25 23:22:00,1426,"  I can atest to that, my 12 year old Citica Bantam 201 was almost completely re-built for $25 plus hst. All the parts were no charge. It works like a new reel again."
700860,Steve,2012-05-29 16:25:00,2075,"Dave, I spoke with a Shimano Canadian Sales rep this AM.  He advised that they are only making the new warranty process known if asked.  Likely next time you ask, you'll be informed accordingly."
700906,DaveMc,2012-05-29 18:00:00,89," i did last week when he was here, and posted that i was told to continue with the over the counter warranty (if the rod in question is in stock)  My 5 Crucial's just got here yesterday that i ordered in for myself, still carrying the lifetime warranty slip. i'm not in any way saying you are wrong, just relaying info that is passed to me."
700908,Squid,2012-05-29 18:05:00,1656,I bought my crucial from Sam when he was in Burlington. That shop has long shuttered it doors so what do we do now if the dealer is out of Business? Do we have to take it to Peterborough or just another dealer like DaveMc?
700911,DaveMc,2012-05-29 18:11:00,89," your best bet is to send it in to Peterborough. if i sold the rod its absolutely no questions asked, if it came from somewhere else i need the bill stating when and where you bought it."
698413,workwear,2012-05-22 02:38:00,592,any one know of where i can get an exchange on my crucial....snapped it on the weekend playing with a little laker  would hate to ship it  thanks in avance
698421,Rod Caster,2012-05-22 03:10:00,5784, I'd like to see the responses for this as well since I'm new to the Shimano flock
698454,mbac31,2012-05-22 10:54:00,904,Bring it back to the point of purchase I beleive is how they are doing it now with receipt.
698646,soobnoob,2012-05-22 20:04:00,55,plan for a day of fishing on Rice... stop in at shimano
698656,bdox,2012-05-22 20:34:00,329,"The stories I've heard lately Indictate that there is no more over-the-counter exchanges happening, unless of course your dealer does you a favor. All rods are being sent back to shimano (at your expense) so they can determine whether it's a defect (warranty, free replacement/repair) or user error (cost of repair/replacement forwarded to customer)  G.Loomis has also instituted a $20 fee for ANY warranty service, although people with NRX reel seat issues seem to be excluded.  Edit: spelling. Damn iPhone!"
698697,workwear,2012-05-22 22:11:00,592,thanks guys.....i guess ill be sending it to peterborough
698718,jedimaster,2012-05-22 23:12:00,3472,"The days of replacement no questions asked onshimano rods is long over. I have a compre I broke while fishing about 6 inches from the end and they say its not covered. I also broke a vrod last year and they didn't replace that either. Netiher got fixed and both are still sitting here. I figure the Compre I'll eventually buy an end guide on it, but I just haven't got around to it. I have not bought a single shimano product since. Bought a few other reels of different mfg's and a few rods as well. Mostly St.Croix and Ardent. I did buy a G.Loomis GL2 though."
698845,addy79,2012-05-23 09:19:00,573,"Anyone know if they discontinued the Cumara 7'1"" xfast medium action spinning rod?? I bought one at BPS and turns out one of the guides was damaged; took it back to BPS and they said they don't offer that model anymore and I can either get a refund or choose a different model Cumara. Oh yeah, they also suggested I keep the damaged rod they sold me, ship it to Peterborough myself and have them replace it, but I would have to assume any costs incurred. BPS Blows! Now I'm having a hard time finding the Cumara drop shot rod, anyone know what store has em in stock?"
698850,Gregoire,2012-05-23 10:00:00,1397,"I know gagnon's has cumara's, but that is a bit of a trek for you."
698857,Fish Farmer,2012-05-23 10:53:00,2234,"If your using braid, it will brake a tip pretty easy. Loosen up your drag. 100% graphite can't take it."
698884,Jer,2012-05-23 12:12:00,1426,"  That surprises me. I broke the tip on an almost new Compre on the door of the boathouse fishing last year and Shimano replaced it, no questions asked. This was at the Shimano office in Peterborough."
698885,DaveMc,2012-05-23 12:22:00,89," I am a Shimano dealer and I havent heard this as of yet (they may be doing this but i havent heard anything from the ontario reps) as of right now we are still running over the counter replacement (if in stock) or having the replacement shipped in. no shipping costs are incurred either. I dont know how other shops handle their warranties but if a shimano product isn't purchased here i must have the original sales receipt showing what you bought, where and when."
698913,Musky or Specks,2012-05-23 13:32:00,2710,Yes Shimano still has the best customer service as far as Im concerned.You do have to take it to where you bought it though. Why should some small shop here replace your rod that you saved money on by getting it at BPS or the states. That's why you should buy your stuff from a local shop.
698958,jedimaster,2012-05-23 15:25:00,3472,"Aikman's in Mississauga used to do replacements no questions asked but they were told not to anymore. He said that some shops will do it but they are under no obligation to do so. The only sure bet is to hit the Peterborough head office and its hit and miss if they will replace it. I know some guys that have had no issues, and other that have had lots of issues. I really liked the feel of that compre for drop shoting. I keep staring at it wishing I could get it replaced. maybe I'll try again in Peterborough and see what happens. I rarely get out there during the week though.  Dito on the go back to the store you got it from if you still have the receipt. I rarely buy anything from bass pro big ticket that may need warranty work because I know what there service is like. I like to buy my stuff from JB's. He has always been good to me and I have no complaints about that store other than I wish they sold more Bass Rod's, but I get that he specializes more in Musky and big water rigger type stuff. I can normally find what I am looking for there though."
699333,DaveMc,2012-05-24 20:49:00,89,"had the ontario rep in the shop today, so i asked him about this and he has absolutely no clue where this is coming from. i was told they havent changed their warranty at all."
699337,jedimaster,2012-05-24 21:01:00,3472,"Traded several emails with shimano about this last year when i tried to get two of my rods replaced. Turn me off of shimano,Only trouble is I have about a dozen shimano rods and a dozen shimano reels. They are slowly starting to get weeded out."
699352,workwear,2012-05-24 22:26:00,592,im in the same boat as you jedi.....12 shimano rods and 12 shimano reels...hope they dont give me a run around....overall im happy with their product...but if they dont wanna stand behind them...ill have to wait and see ....thanks all for your input!!
699361,jedimaster,2012-05-24 23:16:00,3472,"Keep your receipts and hope you got them at a good dealer.  I like the shimano products, just been a bit soured as of late."
699375,uglyfish,2012-05-25 00:14:00,981," Aikmans was a joke. They were dropped as a service center because shimano had too many complaints from customers trying to deal with them!  The new shimano rods, from crucial up, have the wild card warrenty, a one time, no questions asked free replacement on a broken rod, over the counter. After that, I believe its a $60 warrenty fee for a broken rod."
699390,2jack2,2012-05-25 01:21:00,92,"As far as I know Shimano is still doing their best to stand behind their products. the fact is if too many people abusing the warranty, the tighter the service will be. if the rod was broken because of abuse, miss use or accident, don't try to get it replace, sure they will take it back and give you a new one, but when it starting to hurt their bottom line, the next guy with a real ""defects"" rod may have a hard time to get service. About retailer doing over the counter, it is up to the store, best is take it back to where you brought it since the retail should fulfills the after sells service. If the customer choose to use another retailer, a service charge should be apply but again it is up to the store. I was working in the store yesterday and a customer came in and mentioned his crucial rod broke and the store he purchase the rod from is no longer in business, he was not sure what to do, we took the rod and told him we will sent out the rod for replacement, no charge."
699437,DaveMc,2012-05-25 11:27:00,89," they all carry the standard limited lifetime warranty plain and simple. the fees are for products out of warranty. 2jack2, that is how i was raised to take care of customers and that is how i take care of mine now."
699448,Steve,2012-05-25 12:01:00,2075,"""they all carry the standard limited lifetime warranty plain and simple.""  DaveMC, unfortunately that is not correct.  Many of the new Shimano rods are moving to Wild Card program. It has been confirmed directly from Shimano that the standard warranty/expeditor program will be a thing of the past - all rods will have the wild card program."
699546,mugsmuffin,2012-05-25 17:35:00,17,"Forget the Cumara and spend a little more for a Cumulus or a G Loomis, a little more money for at least twice the rod"
699573,MCTFisher9120,2012-05-25 18:55:00,3761,"Shimano does lot's for the fishing industry and that's why I like them. They make great reels nice rods and have never been a issue with me. I send rods back and they are replaced with new models. So old Crucial's were replaced with the new generation Crucial's. Reels are now all a $25 repair fee from Shimano for the labor....9 times out of ten the parts to fix your reel are warranty covered also.  Being in Peterborough and being a fine product with little issues I like there gear, G.Loomis however is my finer choice when talking rods  So to answer your question workwear, bring it to a local store other than bps or mail it to Peterborough"
699579,DaveMc,2012-05-25 19:34:00,89," if they are changing they are changing for next years stock (which will be released this fall), and they havent told their canadian sales reps. as of right now all 2012 the rods i have in stock from Clarus on up have the life time warranty on them, indicated by the limited lifetime warranty slip on the reel seat."
