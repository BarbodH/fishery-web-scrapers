700157,Joey,2012-05-27 20:51:00,9122,"Well we tried our darndest to get team 1 a whitefish today, had a few follows, caught a few zebra mussels, but that's the most excitement we had.  Ralphie was great in the boat so here's a few pics of him (he mostly slept).  Try jigging with a pupply sleeping on one arm      I finally got him to sleep on his little bed for awhile, but not long, had to put my jacket on him for comfort     He did tour the boat a few times and went up front with Paul for awhile.  I had him tied up tho as it was only his second time in the boat.  He wore his lifejacket there and back but it was bothering him while anchored so I just tied him up on a short leash.  On Daddy's lap      So a nice day on the water, but el skunkaroo for us and no whities for team 1.  Sorry team, we'll try again another day.  I think Paul and B may have plans for next Saturday now"
700158,lew,2012-05-27 20:58:00,12766,Me thinks Ralphie is gonna  be one spoiled pooch
700160,misfish,2012-05-27 20:59:00,29133,"Paul looks so grown up,with that new hair cut.  Ralphie,aint no puppy.He,S getting huge.  Betty went AWWWWWWWWWWWWW.    Paul,we need inches,try the hold the lip/tail thing next time. Me bad J."
700163,spincast,2012-05-27 21:04:00,3279,"I think he already is Lew.  Good practice for the little fella. Thats really too bad you didnt get any whities for your team Joey   Guess you'll have to try another weekend.. We found the fishin' tough today too; only three in the boat, and G wasnt able to add any inches to your team either, although I understand Team 4 got a few more."
700165,Joey,2012-05-27 21:07:00,9122," Ummm, I think gonna be has left the building Lew"
700171,Musky or Specks,2012-05-27 21:16:00,2710,Well it was a nice day to be out and getting the dog use to the boat is often easier without all the theatrics of catching fish. Believe me its not fun with a mastiff pup new to the canoe.
700172,Terry,2012-05-27 21:18:00,14456,whitefish have not been easy this spring
700174,aplumma,2012-05-27 21:20:00,6896,A smile a puppy and a fishing rod what more can you ask for... well yea fish but 3 out of 4 ain't bad.
700265,mercman,2012-05-28 00:21:00,7054,At least i caught a couple of Walleye  
700367,motv8tr,2012-05-28 09:45:00,2587,"He's a cute little fella, glad to see he's comfortable in the boat, I think there's lots of good boating times ahead for the three of you  Maureen"
