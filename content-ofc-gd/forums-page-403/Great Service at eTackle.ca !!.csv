I just had the pleasure of making my first purchase from eTackle.ca   I'm sure there will be many more to come as I update my tackle arsenal.  Phil was a delight to deal with, and deserves this recognition.  I am in no way affiliated with the company, just a happy customer and thought I'd share this with others on the board.  Jeremy"
