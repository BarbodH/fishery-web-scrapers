Special congrats goes out (yet again) to my sister's bf Austin Watson. He has been the 1st star in 2 of the 3 games that London has played in the Memorial Cup, to go along with his OHL Playoff MVP. Hopefully this fall he crack's the Nashville Preds lineup!  Best of luck in the finals Knights! Bring the title home to Ontario!"
699191,Ralph Field,2012-05-24 12:37:00,1018,It sure would be nice to have London win Sunday. Austin must have a lot of bruises after blocking shot after shot.
699397,wildeye rainbow,2012-05-25 02:01:00,123,Go Knights Go!  It would have been nice if the JLC was opened up for the game & let a crowd watch the game on the scoreboard- It's likely occupied for some other event.  WR
699417,Stoty,2012-05-25 03:31:00,2910, Agreed on both counts! LOL
699769,Stoty,2012-05-26 04:29:00,2910,London vs the host team Shawinigan for the finals! 7pm Sunday on Sportsnet!  Should be a great game!
700309,Grimace,2012-05-28 01:54:00,2020,Awesome game!   1-1 in the third.   London is looking great.  The Watson/Rupert line looks great as usual.
700329,Stoty,2012-05-28 02:56:00,2910,What a game!!!! Almost done the 1st OT period! Back and forth action!
700332,Grimace,2012-05-28 03:05:00,2020,Great game!   Shawinigan wins in front of the home crowd.  You just had to love it. I was rooting for the Knights in this one but you have to love the way the Cataractes won it the hard way!  Nothing beats junior hockey.
700333,Stoty,2012-05-28 03:07:00,2910,"What a great game, but a very disappointing result.  Not sure about a team getting an automatic entry into the tournament while being eliminated over a month ago from playoff's though.... Sucks to see teams that worked hard to win their league's not end up winning the CHL championship."
700339,Grimace,2012-05-28 03:17:00,2020,That's the way it has always worked.  3 Champions plus the host.  The host is always chosen as a competitive team.  The proof of that is the fact that they just won the cup.   No sense in complaining about the template in which the Memorial Cup has always been run now.  I am sure when you heard the Cataractes had beaten the Sea Dogs you were pleased as you would rather London play Shawinagan than Saint John.  I am sure you were not complaining of the tournament format then and were licking your chops at a championship game against a seemingly inferior team.  Congrats to Shawinigan.  They did it the hard way having to win 3 sudden death games in a row against teams that were deemed better than them.  That is Championship material.
700341,Stoty,2012-05-28 03:21:00,2910,"They def deserved to win...they beat all three league champions... Just kinda defeats the purpose for a team that has already been eliminated from the playoffs, to have a chance at the championship.  Thats like a team being eliminated in the 2nd rd of the Stanley Cup playoffs, but being able to still win it. Just a kinda dumb rule, IMO.  And I would have rather them played Saint John... wasn't impressed with them at all.  Not taking anything away from Shawinagan at all, great team but they were already eliminated."
700604,reelinrolly,2012-05-28 23:33:00,281,Either way. London is young. They will be back. The hunters have built an amazing organization!!!
700668,kickingfrog,2012-05-29 02:06:00,8333,"A host team generates local fan interest and atmosphere. Host teams that get beat out early in their league play-offs rarely win the cup, but in one game, anything can happen."
