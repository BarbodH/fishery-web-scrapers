700051,Lakeshore,2012-05-27 14:09:00,56,"Hello everyone, I am going to be cottaging for 1 week on Gibson Lake in the Middle of August. There will be several families accompanying together, with a few adult newbie fishermen and some kids that enjoy fishing. I would apprecaite it if someone on the board with a little experience about the lake could help me out with some fishing advice to help our week go better. I am not an experienced fisherman, but I can hold my own on the water. I am just looking for information that would help us have an enjoyable week on the lake and catch a few fish while we're at it. We do not have a boat, so we will need to rent either a fishing boat or a pontoon boat to fish from.  I could also use information about where I can do that as well.  I understand that members don't like to divulge too much information, but I will proably fish the lake for a few days and probably not be back again unless we decide to cottage there again next year. I just want to ensure that everyone has a good time on the water and we catch a few fish while we're at it.  Thanks everyone"

Hit the back bays with a Rapala #12 Husky Jerk, in silver, or gold..  You'l pick up a few pike doing that.  I've never targeted anything other then pike and pickerel on Gibson.  But I'm sure you could find the odd bass too.  There's also great cliffs to jump from.  You'll see the locals there for sure on the weekends."
