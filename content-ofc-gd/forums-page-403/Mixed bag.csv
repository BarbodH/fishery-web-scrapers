700282,mikeseb,2012-05-28 00:58:00,201,"Went out today looking for some steel and suckers and ran into a few surprises.  After floating live worms through 3 different spots i decided to take a break, set up a worm with a bunch of weight and threw it out there.  Before i could even unwrap my beef jerky the rod tip went crazy and I had a fish on!  At first i thought just a sucker but when i brought it to the bank i was wrong.  It was a channel cat my first this year and a big surprise because ive never herd of anyone ever catching cats in this trib.  A quick pic and a new worm and i was sitting on the bank enjoying my jerky when the rod started dancing again.  After a short fight I had a decent sized sucker on the bank.  I decided bottom fishing was the way to fish today and went back to a more productive spot that i was shut out at earlier in the day.  while crossing the stream i spooked a nice sized carp that was sitting dead still in only 2 feet of water.  I got to the spot and was surprised again when i noticed a small pike sitting in some slack water.  I quickly through on a spinner and attempted to fool him but after 10 minutes and a few follows i gave up and went back to worms.  The rest of the day was fairly slow with only a few suckers and a very small OOS smallie and a rocky.  I saw a few steelhead but they wanted nothing to do with my offerings.  There was also a TON of dead lamperays scattered all over the river bottom which was nasty.  I managed to snag and ""dispose"" of one and would have loved to come across and dispose of more of these unwanted freaks.  All in all it was a good day on the water, seeing or catching 7 different species of gamefish is always a great day!   "
