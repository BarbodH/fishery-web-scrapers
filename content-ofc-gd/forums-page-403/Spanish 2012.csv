To keep it short and sweet, the weather man has been smoking again, the 2 forecast days of rain never happened, a little breezy on Friday but Sat/Sun made up for it.  Walleye weren't quite in the abundance of last year but I blame the early spring for that.  There were a couple short no feed periods, but catching all day long is the norm.  The 20 incher above is the average, some smaller, some bigger.  I latched onto one that I never did get to see, it may even have been a big cat or sturgeon.  It just kept head shaking and slowly peeling line with a hook spit. The others in our group of 8 did equally well.  I'm not much of a picture taker but I'm thinking 12foot will post some more when he gets back.  If all goes well, we'll go back again.  "
