700190,Raycaster,2012-05-27 21:45:00,528,"Been on the West Arm, Cache Bay and Lavigne but never to Callander Bay.  Heading up next weekend to Callander Bay and just wondering how it's been so far and how's the water level?"
700201,kickingfrog,2012-05-27 22:00:00,8333,My brother was at our uncle's place this Wednesday. Water is bang on normal (looks high because its been so low for a few years). My brother fished one day and did real well. Nobody else did much. I leave a week this Monday.
700227,kickingfrog,2012-05-27 22:57:00,8333,"One afternoon, one person, one bait. Maybe when there is 2 of us in the boat we can patern them a little better.  He kept a few eaters (no photos of them) for him and my uncle who can't get out to fish too much now.              "
700230,Rod Caster,2012-05-27 23:04:00,5784,Nice fish KF's Brother!  I did well last sunday just in front of the waterfrong. Jigs with  white twister tails.
700289,Scott S,2012-05-28 01:05:00,203,"My brother's are up there right now. Water levels are normal. Fishing is OK,they said they are getting alot of small ones. I'm heading to Callander this Saturday and hopefully can find them. Scooter"
700290,Raf,2012-05-28 01:09:00,3495,what are the water temps on nip now?
700296,Rod Caster,2012-05-28 01:26:00,5784,Nipfisher apparently caught all the walleye in the lake tonight. Hope we hear from him.  Grrr to work
700321,rdambros,2012-05-28 02:35:00,71,"I was there on the long weekend. Water temps are just about pushing 70s, with the shallow bays in the 70s. Water levels are high so you have to watch the electronics for submerged shoals. The fishing was okay, hard to find any good concentration of fish. As has already been said, the size is small, but there are the occasional larger ones, but maybe only one in a day.  We mostly fished baldheaded jigs with worms. I caught a few on gulp alive, orange and yellow with a twister tail. The big fish was caught on a husky jerk in shallow water (go figure). Also did well trolling harnesses tipped with minows. Try a jigging spoon near the shoals and let me know how it goes. Cast it out and rip it as soon as it hit bottom, and repeat.  Good luck"
700327,Nipfisher,2012-05-28 02:50:00,2449,"  We left alot in there R.C.   Got out tonight with a couple buddies. 3 of us in the boat and we managed 28 walleye in under 3 hours. Also caught a few perch a pike and a sheepshead. We were along the waterfront trolling/drifting in 14-17 feet of water. Water temp was 66 tonight but it was 70 on Thurs in the same area.  Go-getters tipped with half a worm and jig with stinger hook tipped with worm caught everything for us. Lots of small eyes in the 9-12"" range but at the end of the night we took home 12 fish that were all 13.5-15.5"".   Here are my 4 keepers.    "
700392,Billy Bob,2012-05-28 12:44:00,5865, GREAT eating size....YUMMY....
700468,Raycaster,2012-05-28 16:36:00,528, Hey! leave some for our group next week!  Any pike?
700481,davis,2012-05-28 17:30:00,128,"Just came back from our annual weekend trip on Nipissing at Sunset Cove lodge (just over from Callander Bay). Caught plenty of fish between 10 guys - we all maxed out for eaters, and lots more were thrown back. About 99% of fish were caught on a jig/worm (we're lazy like that) and at all times of the day. Fishing 20' depths seemed to get the most action. Water temps were hovering around 70. Noticed that size was down quite a bit from our previous trips. Most if not all eaters were 12"" and under - hardly any in the 13"" - 15"" range and only a couple were caught in the 20""+ range. 25"" was the biggest for the weekend.  Good luck!"
