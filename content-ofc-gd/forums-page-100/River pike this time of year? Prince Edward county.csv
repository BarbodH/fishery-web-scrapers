997152,Weeds,2017-03-16 19:16:00,782,"I'm thinking of taking a day trip down to Prince Edward County. I've spent a huge portion of my life down that way as a child and then a young man. A lot of camping, beer drinking and chasing girls as a teen (good thing for me the chase is better than the catch) and now I continue to take my family there that I have one of my own. I've caught a few pike while camping in the summer in a few of the rivers down that way. Providing I find open water are they still likely to be found in fairly shallow water; I won't be taking the boat, just casting from shore along the river. Just waiting for a sunny day above zero and a chance to get off work. Any insight is appreciated. Thanks"

It wasn't as easy to get them to bite as to find them in a few feet of water. Spearing was legal then."
997182,Rizzo,2017-03-17 00:40:00,4754,No clue about the fishing but it sounds like we have similar fond memories of growing up spending time in Prince Edward County. If I could only count the number of times I got kicked out from Sandbanks...man that made for some interesting adventures.
