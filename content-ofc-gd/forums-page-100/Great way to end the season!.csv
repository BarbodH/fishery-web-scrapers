Between work and a young family, I havent been out on Simcoe since Family Day weekend.  I got a full day to get out yesterday and made the most of it.  Plan was to run and gun some shoals until we found fish, luckily the first pick was good and we never moved.  Landed 16 fish myself and Seb was around the same.  Great day on the lake with a lot of quality fish.  Love last ice!  Unfortunately its my last day of the season, but at least it ended on a high note!"
