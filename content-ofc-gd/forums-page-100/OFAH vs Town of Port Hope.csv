995841,craigdritchie,2017-03-01 05:28:00,1586,"I can see that, those charges could easily be debated in court and waste tax payer's money in the court system, even if the guy is brutally guilty.  Catching someone fishing without a license is pretty cut and dry. So what's the advantage of catching someone fishing without 2 licences, the provincial licence and the Port Hope licence?  If the snagger buys 1 licence he could buy 2.  If not, it could be easily argued ""I've got an Ontario licence, I didn't know you need another licence to fish here""  You'll probably ignore this but whatever, I think this is the wrong path to take.  Your points are well taken, Chris. And believe me, I don't like this situation any more than you do. We all pay more than enough taxes in this province as it is, we shouldn't have to buy yet another license because some people are goons.  Part of Port Hope's original proposal that got lost in all the fuss about another license was to simply ban fishing in town at night. I don't have a problem with this .....  IF that gives the cops something concrete they can charge poachers with. There's no arguing in court, you're either fishing in the dark or you're not. The snaggers can't wiggle out of those charges.  Let's face it, the worst of the carnage is the stuff that goes on at 2 in the morning when guys are down there slicing fish like Jack the Ripper. They can't really do that in daylight, when there are people around. So if banning night fishing gives the cops a concrete way to nail those idiots once and for all, then I would be willing to accept that. I'd like it even better if the fine was substantial.  The whole issue at Port Hope amounts to some idiots leaving trash all over and piles of sliced up fish to stink up the town. Get rid of those guys, and we're not even having this discussion.  I would have preferred to see OFAH work with Port Hope to find a solution - even supporting a night fishing ban - than to just dig in their heels and become antagonistic. That was disappointing, and it does nothing to solve the problem."

The graphic shows major purchases or investments attributed to angling - the same thing that the other tables you mention show, but this one broken down to purchases made specifically for fishing and not made for other purposes as well as fishing (like a truck or cottage, for example).  Someone who comes to Port Hope for the day to snag salmon already bring their own tackle with them, so we can take out the fishing equipment category altogether. They aren't coming to Port Hope to buy a boat, camping equipment, a truck or a cottage, so those categories can come out too. What's left is the ""Other"" expenditures.  For the entire province of Ontario, ""Other Expenditures"" total $27.8 million dollars in 2010, which is (amazingly) the most recent data available.  That is not ""manipulating statistics"" as you suggest. It is simple reality.  No, it's not reality. Tables A9 and A11 are completely separate and table A11 has nothing to do with the discussion here as it applies to major purchases only, i.e. boats, trucks, real estate, fishfinders, reels, etc. Table A9 is talking about stuff like transportation, lodging, food, charters, etc.  Read descriptions on pages 8 and 9.  As a result, the claim is that ""the economic impact of fishing for all of Ontario is about $27.8 million"" is incorrect, since, for example, Food and Lodging angling related expenditures alone exceed $325.6 mil.  And again, I don't care how it all applies to Port Hope, since without data it's all just guesswork, I just wanted to point out that ACTUAL economic impact of fishing for Ontario is much higher than $27.8 mil and in fact far exceeds $1 bil.

Previous to the move I lived 5 min from the Nottawasaga (Thornton area)  and fished it at least 3 times a week in the Fall and spring for a long while. I was spoiled , to say the least, i thought Angus could get bad LOL. I now fish with numbers in excess of 100 on most days ,  Garbage is Insane, angler etiquette is non exsistant in most cases from everyone and not any particular race or culture. We've had idiots wearing 3000$ worth of gear try to grease me and my boy (7yrs) out of our spot because they're ""locals"" and we've dealt with others that likley didn't no any better sporting 20$ worth of gear. There was one day last year that a few guys insisted me and my boy fish a prime spot and moved so he could get in there, they weren't locals and english was a second language . Port Hope definitely has a problem , fall being the worst time.  I've stood on the walking bridges as a spectater to the carnage and its INSANE!!  I also remember when Essa township implemented their fees , drove me nuts as a tax payer to the township, honestly only started buying one once my son started fishing with me as previosly I would only drift water i was likley  not to encounter any other anglers on . Even now the reality for that system (Notty) is pontoon boats and wanna be guides. Still a great fishery though, Miss it!! Unfortunately as seen in Essa, anglers will still disrespect the resources , seriously whats 40$, that doesn't even buy 3 Rapala's, and  hardly a decent 24 of beer. Theres no point to a fee , charge a fee and you lose the support of your ""local "" anglers , this actually does carry some clout ANYWHERE !

995644,porkpie,2017-02-27 15:26:00,2521,"So that works, I can afford your proposed fee, I make decent money.  I can pay to play.  I know that when I was 18, and a river rat spending all my free time fishing anywhere from NY state to Huron, Georgian bay, hell wherever there where fish, a $500 license would have been the end of it.  I used to sleep in my car on extended trips and eat from the dollar menu at fast food joints, or live on granola bars and nasty old sandwiches from home. Spare cash was for gas and terminal tackle and upgrades to equipment came from saving up what I could  or my parents at Christmas.  Most of my planned savings was for school or to keep my beater on the road and pay for exorbitant insurance costs.  My parents didn't just hand me stuff unless it was at a Christmas or a birthday.  And how about those guys who work in a factory for 35k or 40k  a year and still have family's and all the expenses that come with it.  Does $500 a year in licensing still sound reasonable to you?  Not everyone on the water is fishing out of a ranger and tossing lures with the newest loomis offering."
995647,John Bacon,2017-02-27 15:34:00,3277,"call me crazy, but would this additional licensing requirement allow for municipal by-law enforcement to join in on the enforcement activities related to this ish show. Ive fished port hope, didnt see anything crazy during my visit but to me any additional enforcement that can be done to stop the crap show is worth it.  There is nothing to stop them from joining the enforcement efforts now."
995648,chessy,2017-02-27 15:44:00,610,"The OFAH is doing exactly what their membership want them to do, as they should! Attempting to prevent loss of public access or pay to play fishing. They frequently intervene in attempts by council to restrict access to angling and hunting by enacting restrictive bylaws. This is what the membership supports them for. Some of those members may be poacher loogans. The OFAH executive have no way of knowing who is who when complaints about the direction port hope council is going roll in. Now I pretty much think that just about everything to do with salmon fishing in rivers is a complete joke at this point, but I support people's right to do it, and if the OFAH wants to spend some of my membership funds to combat a restrictive (for some) access pass then I'm okay with it! As for angling dollars to the town, I'm probably like most, I'll buy coffee and lunch when visiting, and most likely gas the truck. That's probably about it. I recall from years past that the hotels and motels around port hope filled to the brim for trout opener, so for a weekend things probably have a bit of a financial impact on the town, but nowhere near what people expect over the course of the year.   The ofah talks from both sides of there mouth .. they dont want a additional access fee. but they are ok with simco county forest having a ofah membership to hunt . they wanted the same for northumberland county forest and they wanted the same for Kendall crown game preserve and the charge a additional fee for duck hunting at darlington . so what the differnce... oh ya the town will use it for the offset of cost not put in the pockets of the ofah . maybe the ofah can donate 20 000 grand from the 1.1 million the provincial and federal government gives them"

There are very very few people that making minimum wage at 40 years old that have lived their lives 100% straight 100% of the time. blanket statement...im aware, but seriously if you grew up in Ontario went to school, lived a clean sober life and have worked your entire life and are still making minimum wage something is up.  If you are a kid (under 30 years old) ya maybe you can make an exception, how about a licensing fee that is relative to your income? They do this for speeding tickets in europe.  I personally catch flak around here cause i buy good fishing gear...funny how that is...i have the casual scotch or beer, never go to the bar, dont smoke, gamble, drink coffee, or puff herb unless its being offered to me. I pack lunches every day at work and have a mortgage and bills just like the next person.

995654,porkpie,2017-02-27 16:18:00,2521,"Sure, if you looked at only one segment of society, then you would be right.  My day to day brings me I touch with people from the well to do members of society, to the gutter rat meth heads.  Somewhere in the middle, there are a ton of  people who can not afford what you propose, and it would completely exclude them from a public resource.  And it's not always because of their actions, or what they do with their income or choose to spend it on.  And then there are people of limited means who choose to spend money on booze and smokes and fish as well.  They have the same right to public water as you or I do.  I'm not giving you a hard time about your choice of tackle.  I just insured mine for loss and nearly gagged at the total.  My point is that on here you see a cross section, but most of the big talkers are big spenders or guys who guide or tackle junkies who can't resist deals (me).  There are lots of guys who shoe string it with a pail of minnows and a small box of lures.  They shouldn't be priced out of the market.  It's easy to say the world is like this, when you only look at the people you know.  Most likely they come from similar backgrounds and have similar opportunity.  Not always, but most often.  If I looked out my front door, I'd see a string of households that could afford a $500 fishing license.  If I went across town to some of the guys sitting down by the bridge on the river on Saturday mornings with a pole and a box of worms, not so much!"

Police officers can enforce fishery laws just like a CO.  However, they don't have the same training as COs so they usually only enforce basic laws such as fishing without a license.  Snagging is a law that they could enforce.  They can certainly do a lot more than enforce anti littering laws if they are interested in doing so."

It's not something I would support, and it does seem that they are talking out of both sides.  Nonetheless I still have to support them on this one.  I fished port hope since I was 15 or 16 and I'd hate to see public access fishing end up as fee based fishing like in Europe.  If it goes like that, eventually anyone of a certain income will only fish for carp if they live in southern Ontario."
995664,bigugli,2017-02-27 17:00:00,6138,"The biggest problem is the precedent being set. Another tax grab where every conservation authority begins demanding an additional license to fish their waters The Grand River Conservation Authority looked at this possibility a few years back, Next in line would be numerous municipalities. NOTL only allowed residents with permits to fish public lands within their municipality. Thankfully it has since been repealed. How many others might follow suit. We would just be like England with 100's  of jurisdictions each demanding their own fee."
995669,Headhunter,2017-02-27 17:27:00,5703," I've caught Bows with loose eggs, ready to drop them, from Oct right through winter until past season opener in May, so what you propose would basically shut down any river steelheading, really, does it matter if a fish is a little prego or a lot prego ? if it is caught and kept it's not going to spawn again. Towns like Port Hope would see a lot more money coming into their coffers if they closed the ditches to both spring and fall runs. That would mean that folks wanting to catch these fish would have to fish the big lake, launch boats and potentially stay in motels for a weekend fish. Launch fees alone would net the local economy more that the cup of coffee they sell to the odd fisherman. The fish win as they are able to re-produce without interruption and the local businesses win as they are not paying for clean up in their area and could net $$ from fisherman. So again, why are these fish being hunted during spawn? Imagine the fury if they opened Pickereye fishing during spawn? Pike, bass.... HH"

995684,farsider,2017-02-27 18:56:00,456,"This all comes back to one thing...lack of enforcement.  If there was greater enforcement of existing laws, the problem would end or be contained.  It is foolish to think a separate license will solve it.  It might push some of the nonsense to other rivers that already experience too much of the same crap year after year during Salmon/Trout runs but, ""solve"" it....No.  Not even close to a broad solution and it is a dangerous precedent and could create a domino effect across the province.  The lack of enforcement of existing laws is what has brought about all the frustration by Townsfolk, and other anglers.  The same frustrations anybody who visits a Salmon/Trout river have during the run.  Locally, why don't they up the fees for local bylaw infractions like littering/loitering/parking/trespassing , etc. and then enforce them like crazy.  A conservation officer's job has the same cycles as a predator/prey relationship.  Unfortunately, Gov't work is not responsive enough to those kinds of ebbs and flows.  It also seemed that if they increased the fines for wildlife violations and then enforced them appropriately, the fines would cover much of their expenses as an operation.  I also have a hard time believing that even if our fishing/hunting licenses quadrupled, that increase would result in a commensurate increase in enforcement.  Cheers, Mark"

If you pull them out of the mix, the economic impact of fishing for all of Ontario is about $27.8 million. Not that it really relates to the topic but that $27.8 mil figure does not mean what you think it means.  You seem to have simply pulled the ""Other"" number from the Annex A.11 ""Major purchases and investments..."". Quite obviously, it doesn't give you ""the economic impact of fishing"". To get the economic impact of fishing one also needs to consider A.9 ""Direct expenditures..."" and A.10 ""Major purchases wholly or partially attributable to angling..."".

A poacher most likely doesn't buy a fishing license so I wouldn't think they will pay anything to continue poaching. As stated by a few here the key is enforcement. How will these people that break laws and basically uber litter be dissuaded if they know there is no one there to fine them? They won't be, they will continue to do what they do until the fines become so high they will not continue to do what they do. The only reason people don't drive 140 KPH or faster on the roads is the enforcement of the Highway Traffic Act plus the possibility of the sky high fines and increases in insurance rates, loss of a drivers license not withstanding.  If they propose that a fishing licence be much greater than they are now many people simply won't buy a license. It simply is not in my pensioners budget to pay $500.00 to buy a fishing license. I will then become a poacher and risk being fined. I have been asked twice in the last 35 years if I had a license. You can do the math for someone that doesn't buy a permit for 35 years has saved themselves knowing that most likely get a slap on the wrist is all they risk."

995630,FLEX ROD,2017-02-27 13:48:00,394,"OFAH - Ontario Federation Angler Hunter,  What  OFAH is doing is standing up for the Angler portion / membership.  I have been fishing the Ganny since 1972 and I really do not know what Port Hope would look like today if they did not have the out of town fisherman support, but I would bet that it would not look like it does today.  If you take the 45 years that I personally have fished the River I always fill up my tank of gas so 45 years x $50 gas x 10 trips per spring = $ 22,500.  I think that loosing $22,500 from one single angler represent a lot higher amount of investment then just a single burger or a coffee.  What Port Hope should be doing is focusing on working with OFAH , MNR and for that matter any legitimate sports group to improve the quality of sport fishing to the way it was and they would see a much higher return than imposing a $40 fee.  A big step in the right direction of improving things is get rid of the Damn Float Your Fanny Down the Ganny.  What we as Anglers have to remember and start to really practice is "" Leave Nothing Behind But Footprints"" that will be a great first step.  John"

995632,porkpie,2017-02-27 13:52:00,2521,"The OFAH is doing exactly what their membership want them to do, as they should!  Attempting to prevent loss of public access or pay to play fishing.  They frequently intervene in attempts by council to restrict access to angling and hunting by enacting restrictive bylaws.  This is what the membership supports them for.  Some of those members may be poacher loogans.  The OFAH executive have no way of knowing who is who when complaints about the direction port hope council is going roll in.  Now I pretty much think that just about everything to do with salmon fishing in rivers is a complete joke at this point, but I support people's right to do it, and if the OFAH wants to spend some of my membership funds to combat a restrictive (for some) access pass then I'm okay with it!  As for angling dollars to the town, I'm probably like most, I'll buy coffee and lunch when visiting, and most likely gas the  truck.  That's probably about it.  I recall from years past that the hotels and motels around port hope filled to the brim for trout opener, so for a weekend things probably have a bit of a financial impact on the town, but nowhere near what people expect over the course of the year."
995633,AKRISONER,2017-02-27 14:08:00,5558,"call me crazy, but would this additional licensing requirement allow for municipal by-law enforcement to join in on the enforcement activities related to this ish show. Ive fished port hope, didnt see anything crazy during my visit but to me any additional enforcement that can be done to stop the crap show is worth it.  its 40 bucks guys...90% of us have spent more on the line on our 200 dollar fishing rod.  Maybe im in the minority but ive always said I wish fishing licenses were $500 a year, we all spend way more money on trivial Bull then the past time that provides us with months of enjoyment each year.  If you fish 3 days a year, then pay 50 bucks for a 3 day pass...still cheap in relativity.  This is just my opinion."

HH  I've caught Bows with loose eggs, ready to drop them, from Oct right through winter until past season opener in May, so what you propose would basically shut down any river steelheading, really, does it matter if a fish is a little prego or a lot prego ? if it is caught and kept it's not going to spawn again."
995635,Jon,2017-02-27 14:11:00,209,"I'm going to play devil's advocate a bit and suggest that charging people to fish in Port Hope is no different than charging people entry to a national or provincial park, conservation area or pay to launch a boat and then fish. And if the money goes to maintain the properties and enforce the rules rather than general coffers, maybe not a bad thing?  Jon"
995636,jimmer,2017-02-27 14:26:00,2730,"Yikes, this smells bad.  It's spreading by the sounds of it, if other municipalities are doing it already.  Would that mean you would have to pay that fee if you launched in Port Hope?  Maybe they don't want river fishing happening at all and this is the only way they might be able to stop it or slow it. Funny, I was just thinking about trying some pier fishing for the first time in like 15 years."
