996722,Old Ironmaker,2017-03-11 19:57:00,8243,"Driving classes should be mandatory. Not just the rules of the road, a Orangutan can pass a beginners. Real driving ed. Scenes of the aftermath of fatalities. I cringe when I think back driving at 17. I knew well enough then that 16 was just too young. I drove inside the Steel Plant at 16, without a real license though. Talk about times where rules and laws were ridiculously slack. If you got pulled over hammered the Cop took your keys and you picked them up the next day or he told you not to drive and drove away. 16 is too young and 75 is too old. Road tests for anyone over 70 should be mandatory as well. My Father couldn't back out of the driveway at 70 but he flew through the written test every year and drove until he nearly killed someone. Something is really wrong. The Gov. has enough money to go to court and try a woman for giving water to a pig going to slaughter though but not enough for a real drivers ed. young or old. This Province has gone insane."

996636,Pikeslayer,2017-03-10 20:31:00,1443,I randomly came across this Australian commercial on YouTube today. I've never seen this one before and thought it worth sharing. 
996639,Old Ironmaker,2017-03-10 21:04:00,8243,"I have seen that somewhere. Very sobering message. Now I can only pray someone heeds it. Death due to driving hammered has visited close to me too many times. I have been known to take keys from more than 1 belligerent drunk who insisted they are OK, mind your own business. Look at you now, I asked you nicely. I never went overboard. If you are sitting on my deck having a great time and you have had 4 drinks in 45 minutes you are staying here until I feed you, you have a nap and I am satisfied you are fit to drive. Option 2 is stay the night and you can have as many drinks as you wish plus breakfast. Option 3, not good."

996646,Terry,2017-03-10 22:14:00,14456,damn. I dont drink and drive and wish I didnt just watch that
996651,buick14,2017-03-10 23:05:00,741,^^ what he said.
996652,Smokercrafty,2017-03-10 23:26:00,227,"^^^ what they said.  Wow.... Im not gonna lie, that made my eyes tear up a little."
996653,misfish,2017-03-10 23:31:00,29133,This is one NF post I will support.  
996654,spincast,2017-03-11 00:29:00,3279,"Yup Great message. It ain't pretty and its the truth. I attended a session once where an ex opp officer described a scene he investigated. He worked in Parry sound, and lived there, Had for many years. He put a picture up of the scene. A terrible car wreck. You couldn't recognise the cars. There was a ladies white sun hat in the middle of the picture. You didn't really notice it till he said "" see that sun hat.? As I approached the scene I saw that hat. It belongs to my best friends 19 year old daughter. I knew it as soon as I saw it because I had seen her a couple hours before.  As I walked back to close off the highway my best friend was the first car I stopped. I said, you need to stay here. But he could tell from my face something was wrong. He pushed me out of the way and walked to the scene........."".  He quit the force not long after that.  If you know you are drinking, just don't drive there. It stops you having to make a decision when your judgement isn't what it should be. Now, if we can just get the message out about using the phone while driving....."
996659,davey buoy,2017-03-11 00:54:00,5505,Great message and not to take away from that. Texting and driving commercials are just as bad.Need to pay attention everyone !
996660,npt1,2017-03-11 01:05:00,220,"The law's are not tough enough against DUI and DD, = ( DISTRACTED DRIVING ). Penalty for the above charges need to be much more severe. Life time ban from driving laws are in effect in Europe. I wish everyone would abide by this, If you can afford the drink and the drugs, can you please call a Taxi and pay for a safe ride home!!  X2 what OIM said regarding his ""Option 3 ""."
996661,Fisherman,2017-03-11 01:42:00,7201,"That's reality. One of the worst I ever came across was 40 years ago, 02:30, saw the medics and cops on the side of the road by a cornfield, sweeping downhill curve.  A drunk had really been ""giving it"",  lost control, the passenger side of the car collided with one of the really large wooden hydro poles.  The cops and medics were going through the cornfield looking for the passengers head which had been ripped off by the force of the impact.  Found out later the drunk driver survived."
996663,buick14,2017-03-11 02:05:00,741,Same.
996664,Fish Farmer,2017-03-11 02:15:00,2234,"Great message and not to take away from that. Texting and driving commercials are just as bad.Need to pay attention everyone ! X2 They have proven texting and cel phone in hand has caused double the amount of deaths but they won't go their. Cel phones as they say are for emergencies, so leave them in the trunk. If caught with one in your car 6 month suspension. I see it every few minutes I drive, heads looking down, driving in the left lane slowing down no one in front. People walking out in front of cars talking on them. Worlds going crazy. Very touching video I must say."
996665,woodenboater,2017-03-11 02:27:00,2277,No one does dui/ psa commercials like the Aussies. It's a huge problem there and I wish we had the guts to confront it for what it is and does here.

Anyone that drinks and drives deserves a fate meant for musquitoes Sadly it isn't usually the DUI that suffers the worse fate, it's usually some poor innocent person.  I agree that DD is just as bad but I see so many people with their cell phones in their hands or sitting on their lap (sitting up in a truck you get a great view into the car beside you) If I was a cop I bet I could easily nail 25 or 30 people a day without any problem.  Good job on sharing that pikeslayer!"

996686,manitoubass2,2017-03-11 15:25:00,11391,It's huge on our worksite. Nothing like a 5o tonne rock truck driving at you while texting.  It's the cause of probably 80% of our worksite accidents.  Thankfully it's an automatic release being caught
996688,Loonietoon,2017-03-11 15:50:00,1450,As a Safety and Compliance Instructor as well as an Accident Investigator and being a prior Tow Truck Operator it is Disgusting to say the least that this DUI and Distracted Driving is still going on. Remember years back we did not have Cell Phones and we did not have this problem with Distracted Driving..... I show many Videos on this at all my training sessions and drivers just look at me.... DUI seems to not be going a way it increases mostly around Christmas time.... I know this because I know Police Officers as well as Tow Truck Operators as some are my Friends.... People need to take responsibility for their own actions.
996690,Old Ironmaker,2017-03-11 16:15:00,8243,"There must be mandatory classes for High School kids to educate on distracted driving and driving under the influence. I hope there are. I'm not talking about sitting in a room watching videos, go to the Hospitals, wrecking yards and cemetaries to see the real damage. The same goes for the more Sr. of our citizens that I know think drinking and driving is a risk you take in everyday life. I bet 5 out of 10 people leaving a Legion at 4PM are DUI. And the Police must know the same thing. The same goes for rural bars here emptying out at 2 AM, the few that exist at least because the OPP basically shut them down by parking outside at 1AM, that's a good thing for everyone but the guys that lost their businesses."
996696,manitoubass2,2017-03-11 16:30:00,11391," I found that very off, you can sample 10 or 15 scotches, buy a bottle and hop in your vehicle and drive away????  OI we only have about 5 bars in the area, everyone (accept emo) has cabs and cops parked outside.  In emo it's just cops outside. Well and the bar is conveniently across the street from the OPP office"
996698,Old Ironmaker,2017-03-11 16:34:00,8243,Same thing in LCBO's around here. No more than 1 sample per person. Who keeps track?
996701,manitoubass2,2017-03-11 16:46:00,11391,"This was basically a bar in the store!  People were obviously intoxicated. My buddy Adam, a huge scotch guy, probably had 8 ounces or so before we left. He wasn't driving, but still, that's rediculous"

I only wish there was mandatory classes not only for high school kids but for any new drivers. (although they aren't always the culprits) In Lindsay we have a steady line up of people taking their road test (why in Lindsay you ask? Well they can't drive in Toronto so they come here to do their test which we offer in something like 26 different languages. (Anyone around here ever seen a road sign in other than English or French, if you can't do the test in either of those two how can you drive here?)"
