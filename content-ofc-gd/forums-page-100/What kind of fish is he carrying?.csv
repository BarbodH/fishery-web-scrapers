996212,FloatnFly,2017-03-05 00:40:00,1640,looks like a redfish to me
996223,dave524,2017-03-05 12:06:00,4508,"Probably a big ole Grass Carp, they are used in many jurisdictions for vegetation control in ponds on golf courses, even in Alberta Canada still, they were legally sold and used in Ontario up until 2004 until they got lumped in with the other very undesireable Asian Carp. That is why you keep seeing fake news story about them entering the great lakes, we put them here ourselves"
996224,John Bacon,2017-03-05 13:10:00,3277,I was thinking grass carp too.Maybe that's how they spread from one water body to another
