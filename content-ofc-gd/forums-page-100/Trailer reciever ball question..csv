996500,Ronzo,2017-03-08 17:01:00,124,"I always take mine off.  Years ago we were on a family trip to Florida. My sister came running around the back of the family minivan and ran right into the trailer hitch. Cue the ass-over-teakettle effect and the road rashy result. Always pull it out so I or my kids don't do the same. I still chuckle when I think about it, but don't think she was chuckling so much."
996502,grimsbylander,2017-03-08 17:12:00,3016,MIne's in all summer and out after I put the boat away. The only real reason I have for removing it is that I find the receiver will prematurely rust if it's left in. When I remove it in the late fall I just give it a spray of oil and it's done. I see lots of them rusted in place when the rest of the hitch looks good.

996339,Old Ironmaker,2017-03-06 21:11:00,8243,"While getting gas today in Swag Holler (actually Fisherville just east of Dog's Nest) Ontario the lady attendant there warned me that I cold be ticketed because I have my receiver and ball attached to my truck and I wasn't towing anything. Everyone I know and there has to be 5 pickups/SUV's per passenger vehicle out this way and I always see the receiver and ball attached to the truck. She was quite adamant in her opinion that was based on her daughter getting a warning by the local OPP. I can find any legislation concerning this in the Ont. Highway Traffic act for towing. Section 618 I think it was, all and everything else though.  Is she mistaken? Just because I can't find it that doesn't mean it isn't so. I have never heard of this law and I have put a few miles driving in the last 48 years. Are we really expected to disconnect and pull the receiver and ball after every tow? I don't think so. I do take it out and clean and or paint it every few years. More often is what is recommended I believe.  Thanks all,  Johnny D"

I cleaned and painted it and now take it out to clean it up every year or so. You don't want that breaking while towing, the coder pin was so rusted I changed it to a stainless pin. The pin that goes through the receiver must have been a good stainless as it was fine. Lucky that coder pin didn't fail as I believe the locking pin will eventually work itself out."

I did buy a pin with a big wire that goes done under the receiver to other side. Couple towns where a problem and not likely not kids pulling your cotter key.  This monster is easily watched.
