996687,Carp,2017-03-11 15:48:00,1488,"I found someone in Dundas, Ontario She made 3 inch black vinyl block letters/numbers (stick on) for both sides of my boat. It was $20 total for both sides. Since I was working nearby in Hamilton at the time, I ordered and picked up a few days later on my lunch break.  RE: Registration Expiry I'll have to check my paperwork. Can't remember if I registered after 2010."
996689,Loonietoon,2017-03-11 15:54:00,1450,Where do you get letters? I don't want to put those stick on ones from CT. you can go to any boat dealer and you can buy them in a pack with different designs that you want with colors that will work on your boat...
996692,Old Ironmaker,2017-03-11 16:20:00,8243,...nope. I miss spoke.
996731,misfish,2017-03-11 22:47:00,29133,Any sign maker will do them for you. They will put the full number on a sheet.  ( no need buying a whole package with letters/numbers you dont need ) Also you can get what letter design you want. You peal one side off. Lay the numbers on the boat. Sweep a plastic puddy knife over the said numbers. Peal off the backing.
