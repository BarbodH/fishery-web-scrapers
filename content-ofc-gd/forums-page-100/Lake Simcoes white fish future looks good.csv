996194,Fisherman,2017-03-04 20:03:00,7201,"Nice, good to see they are making little ones."
996204,misfish,2017-03-04 22:55:00,29133,"I like the fact that there are naturals coming back. I really think the way the water management has been the last few years, it is helping not only the spawning areas of the white fish, but also the natural reproduction of the lakers. They were draining the lake way to late IMO. The lakers would come in to spawn on the rocks in October, then the lake level would drop. Leaving the eggs to lay on dried up rocks. Now they drop the level in September, giving the spawn a chance."
