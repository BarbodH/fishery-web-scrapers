996274,lew,2017-03-06 12:53:00,12766,I posted a couple months ago about having 5 bucks along with a bunch of does in my yard  every day and how one had a great set of antlers.  I was out wandering around this morning and found one that had dropped off the biggest critter right at the back of the yard. It's been chewed on a bit but still very impressive.  I'm gonna clean it up and put it on the fireplace mantle.

996352,PUMP KNOWS,2017-03-06 22:47:00,937,I always wanted to find a shed when I'm out fishing.  The only thing close was last year when I came across a dead buck

996466,farsider,2017-03-08 02:50:00,456,"Thats awesome Lew!  When the snow melts a bit more you can take a walk into the bush to see if it's other side is around or some other sheds.  Would love to find the ones from that huge Buck that you posted pics of.  Doesn't take long for the mice, squirrels, etc. to get at 'em.  I found one from the same day it dropped and it had already been nibbled too.  Cheers, Mark"
