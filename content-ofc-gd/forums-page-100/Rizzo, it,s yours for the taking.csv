Heres your chance..........................  http://www.bernicewhelanrealty.ca/properties/2981-ridge-road-west-shanty-bay-ontario-l0l2l0  Always loved looking at this house from the water. The pics are awesome.  Ok so, all I need is a AK47 . I will walk the grounds. Just give me the boat house. LOL"
996799,kickingfrog,2017-03-13 01:22:00,8333,I joked with my wife that we should make an appointment with our bank and ask them for a mortgage. If we sold our house 30-40 times would could just about swing it.
996800,Rizzo,2017-03-13 01:53:00,4754,"hahaha...there were so many zeros on the price I am not even sure how much they want. Seems a little small if you ask me Anyways, you are correct, I have been looking. Funny thing is, I actually just bought a place a few weeks ago, closing is still coming up. Your timing is quite coincidental. Unfortunately, its not near Barrie....that was just too far away (not to mention a few zeros out of my budget). It is on a small lake called Habermehl..over near Hanover. I actually asked a question about that lake on here at the time I was looking....and since I got zero public replies (did get one pm) I thought that is a good thing! The less known the better. You are welcome to launch your personal craft there any time. Apparently it has dink pike and stunted largemouth...perfect for my kids!"

996810,OhioFisherman,2017-03-13 04:53:00,6623,Nice shack! The property taxes alone are probably beyond me!
996811,manitoubass2,2017-03-13 06:03:00,11391,Nice golf course!!!
996818,Acountdeleted,2017-03-13 12:30:00,2562,"Well, I could do the 16 part. The rest of it is beyond my means. I feel like I spent money even just looking at that listing."
996821,Headhunter,2017-03-13 12:49:00,5703,"if it wasn't for the baseboards heating, i'd be all over that.. But hydro rates are dropping Raf, so it may be affordable after all! HH"

996831,porkpie,2017-03-13 14:49:00,2521,The baseboard heating really does put it out of reach for the common man!

996898,irishfield,2017-03-13 22:17:00,26272,If you got a spare 215K a year for the property taxes you may be able to afford the asking price! The property is severable after all if you need some maintenance money.... lol.
996900,Raf,2017-03-13 22:27:00,3495,Given the RE market that pad will be what 32 mil in 3 years?  ?
