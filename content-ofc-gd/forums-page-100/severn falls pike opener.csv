Print a map and highlight the areas that look good. The usual stuff, back bays, points, early weeds, saddles. I'd concentrate on water 12ft and less and personally wouldn't fish 12ft deep but run a bait 6-8 down at most. Maybe troll some spots to cover water and get a feel for things. I still troll in spring in spots for pike. In part to take a break from standing/casting, travel from one spot to another and eat. There have been a few threads here on pike lures as well as many others sources. I like the largest husky jerk for trolling and a x-rap for casting (it's a bit heavier and easier to cast with pike gear). Spoons and spinners are classics and plastic trailers add some action and ""lift"" to help with the slower speeds you usually want early in the season."
994700,OhioFisherman,2017-02-18 15:57:00,6623,"If you stay sober you shouldn't end up like that guy? Time enough for drinking once the fishing is done?  No idea at all when pike season opens in that area, but kickingfrog seems to have a good plan, they spawn in shallow water, and probably haven't moved too far from it?"
994703,Slimbo85,2017-02-18 16:27:00,17,"thanks for the tip, just grabbed some huskie muskie leaders at the fishing show yesterday so thats a step in the right direction  the only drinks on my boat are diet pepsi and water, never been a fan of alcohol  thanks again"
994879,Rizzo,2017-02-20 14:19:00,4754,"I don't know names of any of the islands up there, but when I used to fish severn falls area we would launch at the marina and hang a left to go under the train bridge. There are countless weedy bays off the main channel...some quite small (half an acre?) and some quite large (10-20 acres).  I would suggest trolling along the north shore (or at least what I am picturing to be north), and every time you see one of these bays pop into it and fan cast. There are more of these than you could fish in a day. When I lived up that way Severn Falls was usually my first fishing destination when the season opened..as the summer showed up I just found it too busy for my liking."
995304,Slimbo85,2017-02-23 18:59:00,17,"thanks for the tip, looks like i got alot of water to cover  was up at the cottage this past weekend and talked to a guy in town about tea lake...said there are some spots in there  cheers"
995342,BillM,2017-02-23 23:24:00,17367,I wouldn't be fishing Tea Lake if pike are what you're after.  Stick to the Severn or even better GPool.
996512,Slimbo85,2017-03-08 19:39:00,17,"gpool looks like the place to be eh  i see there is a tournament up there that weekend, has anyone ever fished in the top 50 pike series? http://www.top50pike.ca/home  i see that you have to register a team, is it possible to fish by yourself? my mom is gonna be up there with me but im pretty sure she wont wanna be out on the water with me"
996520,AKRISONER,2017-03-08 21:33:00,5558,not sure when the opener is...last year on May 1st swimbaits on a jig head were dynamite...found those big shallow bays and threw them out towards the drop off...non stop action almost every cast in the right spots.
