When theres no snow to back the flaps, that wind gets inside. Pick up some of the eskimo screw in anchors to keep the flaps down.   Brave man being out there today!  Good job!  Thanks Bill. I was almost ready to pack it in before this cold snap came. Long rod was on stand by.   I always get steps 5 and 6 wrong.  Beauty fish.

996628,irishfield,2017-03-10 19:04:00,26272,Nice Brian... is the ice that thin that there's not enough slush from drilling 2 holes to put on top of the skirt??
