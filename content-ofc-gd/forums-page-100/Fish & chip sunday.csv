Full of baby gobys.    Quick slice and dice. Home cut fries. Da best.    Hoping for the ice to hold up this week. Looks like only a couple of days of sorta warm, then back to cold. After that, pack the ice gear away, and get the toon rigged and ready for open water.  "
996237,Terry,2017-03-05 19:10:00,14456,nice
996241,Musky Plug,2017-03-05 20:20:00,398,Looks like some good eats right there!
996247,misfish,2017-03-05 22:03:00,29133,"Triple dipped egg,flour,panko mix. Nice and crunchy and ohhhhhh so good.     BURP"
996261,porkpie,2017-03-06 01:46:00,2521,Looks good!
996262,manitoubass2,2017-03-06 02:31:00,11391,I still gotta try fried whitey.  I love it baked too much though

996412,Sinker,2017-03-07 15:04:00,8692,"Awesome! Did you double fry the fries? I'm not a great cook, but fish and chips is my specialty! I like a home made beer batter on whities, but that does look great!  S."
996436,Rustic-Fisher,2017-03-07 21:45:00,826,NICE !!  we may have to trade some upland birds for whitefish next year !!!!
996457,Big Cliff,2017-03-08 01:35:00,6899,"Nothing but nothing beats a nice light tempura batter for fish. If you have taken care of your catch then a nice light but crispy tempura batter still leaves you with that beautiful fish and nothing to take away from it. I don't like my fish buried in breading and salt and garlic. Clean fresh, perhaps a bit of lemon and a very lght golden batter to package it all, OH YA!"
996461,manitoubass2,2017-03-08 01:42:00,11391,"A lil off topic, learned this camping.  1. Fresh water fish, walleye etc, cooked on tinfoil over a fire with just seasoning salt added before cooking tastes amazing!  2. Pancake mix works awesome as a batter in a pinch"
996485,AKRISONER,2017-03-08 13:33:00,5558,still contemplating whether gobies are the worst or best thing to happen to our fisheries.  Ive definitely caught a number of bass that were just puking them up.
996488,PUMP KNOWS,2017-03-08 14:08:00,937,That looks delicious.  How does whitefish taste compared to walleye?
996493,manitoubass2,2017-03-08 15:03:00,11391,I wanna see what bass look like in 10 years. At this rate some tournies are gonna have 45lb bags coming in
996498,misfish,2017-03-08 16:55:00,29133,What's a walleye ?
996503,manitoubass2,2017-03-08 18:06:00,11391,Better known incorrectly by most as a pickeral ????
996505,AKRISONER,2017-03-08 18:36:00,5558,Better known incorrectly by most as a pickeral  you guys are wayyyyy too americanized  dont even get me going...i was raised calling pike Jack fish as well.
996506,manitoubass2,2017-03-08 18:54:00,11391,I am American lol.
996507,grimsbylander,2017-03-08 19:00:00,3016,I guess the MNR and it's biologists are all American too.
996510,manitoubass2,2017-03-08 19:31:00,11391,Apperently lol. Daddy just didn't teach them right
996532,Acountdeleted,2017-03-08 23:59:00,2562,It's all just a nickname unless you call them Esox Lucious and Sander Vitruis.   So there. Y'all are wrong.   By the way. MNRF byes' only know them as  334 and 131....... might have been 121. Someone on the forum will get that reference.
996537,manitoubass2,2017-03-09 00:30:00,11391,???
996538,Old Ironmaker,2017-03-09 00:30:00,8243,"Tell someone in the states that you caught a Pickerel and they expect to see a Pike. Go for a fish fry of ""yellows"" and you will get Perch. Up in Atticokan a huge Northern would be a Jack Pike. Catch a Silver Bass and you will get 5 names for it here. I once caught a Rainbow Trout and someone said it was a nice Steelhead. You need to be a Biologist to name a Catfish correctly. Here a young Smallmouth is a Greenie. I could go on. A fish by any other name would smell as bad."
