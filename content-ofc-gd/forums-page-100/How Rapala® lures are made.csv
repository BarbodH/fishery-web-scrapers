997036,captpierre,2017-03-15 15:33:00,2521,Pretty slick operation Best crankbaits and stick baits out there IMO. Getting a bit expensive. Bought  a wack from Lebaron's before they checked out.

I loved the smell of Balsa wood being turned. They have a facility in Ireland, look on the box, most likely says Made in Ireland."
