996441,Musky Plug,2017-03-07 23:18:00,398,"Hey guys,  As a spring project I'd like to potentially put a live well in my boat. I have heard/read good things and bad about putting one in and removing some of the flotation foam. I have thought about getting one of the cooler live wells but it would take up to much room in the boat. Just looking for some more input on the subject or if anyone has any experience doing this.  I have an aluminum 16' Crestliner Sportsman, with three benches. I would like to put it in the bench in front of the driver seat. The length of the bench where the live well would sit is roughly 60"" however the live well itself would be about 36"".  I can post pics of the boat and what my idea is if they would be any help. Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated."

996453,mike rousseau,2017-03-08 01:25:00,4661,Do you do tournaments where you need to keep fish alive?  If not then no need for a well  We use a stringer in dads boat and it does just fine  My buddy uses a soft cooler bag and 1-2 frozen 2 litre bottles without concern  Don't get me wrong I love my livewell... but it's not nessesaru for everyone

I also found a pre-fab live well on the cabbalas site unfortunately it won't work for my boat.      If Davis can post a pic of the one I put in my 14 ft sylvan years ago, you would get an idea.  I had an aluminum box welded up, that I slipped it right into the middle bench.   Yes, that's kinda the same idea I'm looking for. Just a drop in. Do you have a pump and aerator as well?     Do you do tournaments where you need to keep fish alive?  If not then no need for a well  We use a stringer in dads boat and it does just fine  My buddy uses a soft cooler bag and 1-2 frozen 2 litre bottles without concern  Don't get me wrong I love my livewell... but it's not nessesaru for everyone   Ya i understand and no tournaments in the forseeable future, but not ruling it out. I currently use stringers now, but looking for an upgrade because I'm probably going to have this boat for a while."

Yeah I had a nice square welded aluminum live well that was a bench seat in my centre console, 20 plus years, never used it as such , plugged the exterior hull holes and used it for tackle storage.  Edit : Costco has a nice cooler bag with their Logo on it cheap"
