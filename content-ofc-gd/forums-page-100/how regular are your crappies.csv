995832,Smokercrafty,2017-03-01 02:10:00,227,"I find for the Simcoe area, after ice out is a key time, BUT, don't quote me on this, water temp is another key factor(55 degrees rings a bell). I've found my luck in several marinas after ice out. It's been a few years now, but when I did find them, they were plentiful and large. 1/8 salted tubes did the trick."
996199,muddler,2017-03-04 21:02:00,623,"The crappie in our lake stay relatively deep after ice out, still in the basins at 15-20FOW, they don't really move to the shallows until 2 or 3 weeks after ice out, then they can bee found very shallow in the mud bays and weeds, especially south facing ones. But that is just on our lake, other water bodies in other parts of the province would be different I guess. Spot on. The areas that warm up the fastest (north shores) will hold the crappies first and longest .  Just about any small bait will work some days. I use 1/16 ounce jig inside 1 1/2 inch tubes. 2 inch triple tails (Cabelas) . A light steelhead float or a small slip bobber will work.  Fish about 3 feet off bottom ( they usually attack from the bottom)  around wood or cover(docks, boat houses, trees etc). Gently lifting the float will attract attention if they are around. Colour is pretty important  most of the time. There are days when one colour will out produce every other presentation one day and a totally different one the next. My personal favourites are red/white/,pink,  chartreuse/yellow, white and blue/white. use 4lb test mono on a light rod and you're good to go. They don't chase bait a lot when the water is cold. Yes 55 degrees(someone mentioned that earlier) is the magic number for me.  Cooler water than that and they will hold closer to a heat source.  I have a couple of boat houses that I fish that have a corner facing due south. Crappies will school up there first.  Try the other corner....nothing.  Ideal depth is around 10 feet or less. I kid you not about colours. The Michigan anglers that come here just for spring crappie come loaded with hundreds of different coloured plastics just for crappie. NONE use minnows.  Best tasting fish as far as I am concerned. Great for the kids to catch too.  mud"
996279,AKRISONER,2017-03-06 13:52:00,5558,"thanks for the info muddler...after this past weekend its just going to be a matter of following them...we hammered 10"" + slabs all day on saturday, finally made up for the bogus ice season that we had this year. Hit a PB as well, its promising to see the average size is good, cause we know that theres gonna be a monster in the group, its only a matter of time before we find her."

995666,AKRISONER,2017-02-27 17:09:00,5558,"Hello fellow crappie masters  with the end of february comes the dreaded ""closed season"" on Georgian Bay where the 2 major species accessible via ice are off the books.  In previous years this has pretty much meant a 90% shut down on fishing for me until May, however my buddy dave has a fever, and the only thing that will satisfy it is crapolas.  ive fished the PAB area for close to 13 years and never caught or have even seen a single crappie. That was until 2 weeks ago when ice fishing a spot that i have fished before but without the help of electronics...sure enough the streak was broken like the leafs cup drought...weve found the crappies and the spot has produced consistently every time we have gone back since. (and will hopefully continue to because we only catch and release)  the past two springs close to ice off we have done our damndest to try find the elusive buggers using floats and the standard crapola gear. The same gear that Dave has done very well in June pre-bass season in the kawarthas...so heres where the help comes in.  Ive read countless articles on these glorified sunfish, but what the heck am I doing wrong?  Heres how I have it laid out in my mind....crappies start in the winter in the deepest basins schooling up on bait, as the winter wears on they then begin their migration towards spawning grounds and will begin staging at basins at the mouth of inlets...where we are finding them right now.  I suspect these crappies will then move in with the current towards the river mouth to spawn in the shallows near said rivers...is this true? and if so what the heck is the timing of all of this happening. Ive heard people say on this forum ""I know its spring when the crappies are so shallow their backs are sticking out of the water"" when the heck does this happen? The crappies we are on right now are definitely not shallow, but are close to a river, and the area we are in has significant current.  Can anyone provide some insight on when I could expect these fish to start making their next move? I imagine we will know that they have had a change of heart when they vanish from our honey hole.  Anyone feel free to chime in, feel free to throw out the names of your favourite baits...and most importantly feel free to share your pictures of them slabs!  ill start it off with a small one but lets see your slabs!

995677,OhioFisherman,2017-02-27 18:16:00,6623,"I have never seen any indication that crappie move towards a river to spawn, some of the best areas I have fished for them here were well sheltered marinas or coves, little or no wave action and no current.  Road Runners, 2 inch sassy shad on a 1/8th ounce jig head, a lot of different lures will work for them, but nothing beats an emerald shiner!  They also will bite real well at night."
995678,AKRISONER,2017-02-27 18:18:00,5558,"Beat me to it!!  glad you guys caught on ahaha  funny ohio, literally the complete opposite of what I have read.  areas with current are the first places to thaw in the spring and therefore the crappies go there to spawn. shallow mud flats at the end of areas with current?"

Here at least, they head into shallows to spawn, lil narrow inflows and reeds.  I use a small buckshot rattle spoon tipped with frozen shiner heads. That's all I ever use. Even mid winter  I've noticed though, a specific technique that works well for me, and finding it was due to electronics.  The lure brings in fish, no doubt about it. You'll catch a few fishing it normally. But dropping the lure to bottom, rest, then rip it up 2 or 3 feet produces a frenzy of bites  That rip up is sometimes a true rip, sometimes it's a little slower  But almost all the bites come of the chase up  Photo of my PB using this technique  "
995686,Terry,2017-02-27 19:05:00,14456,"Crappie spawn after bass  Crappie move into the shallows to feed right at ice out, some of my best crappie fishing has been in marinas as soon as there is a hole in the ice big enough to fish from docks   Shorelines the warm first. Over hanging trees with open water. All Hold crappie."
995691,AKRISONER,2017-02-27 20:00:00,5558,"great manitou, weve got them dialed right now in 25 FOW, easy fishing through the ice with a flasher once they are around. Ripping buckshots tipped with minnow heads we see them storm up from bottom. the trick is that I know for a fact these fish are going to move shallow, I am just trying to time when that happens right.  Terry, this is also great information...i always thought the crappies were coming in to do their business at ice out, just like the pike and eyes, turns out they are just there to feed...probably on the roe that the pike are dropping!  Timing wise, is their movement shallow totally related to the ice coming off? or is it a specific 2-3 week period that they move in during?"

995697,Old Ironmaker,2017-02-27 20:22:00,8243,"Braggart.  The guys fish the docks of Marinas as soon as the ice out here on Erie's north shore. Since there is no ice in sight I really wish I could help. But I can tell you I occasionally go to a upper NY State inland lake for the Pike opener 2nd weekend in May. There is a couple there that fish 100% for Crappie. They have been going there for the last 50 years, they are in their 70's. They bring in 2 full 5 gallon pails day in and day out by noon then clean fish all afternoon. They use micro spoon jigs below pencil floats right on shore where there are overhanging trees and broken limbs under the water, no bait. They slay them and it is in the middle of May. Sometimes the gentleman told me they will tip the mini spoon shaped jig with a tiny twister tail."

Old piles, cribs and docks always hold fish.  this place always delivers when i throw out questions. Good stuff.  and No im not delusional for catching and releasing, i just dont enjoy eating fish that much. The odd deeply hooked one hits the fire pit, but aside from that my fishies swim to eat another day."
