The old Black and White Garmin I have has to be over 15 to 20 years old. It sits next to my 2 year old Bird. I see almost exactly the same thing on both, depth, structure, noise, baitfish. I will often just use the Garmin for fish finding and the leave the HBird on full screen GPS. I guess that says a lot about the quality of Garmin, back then anyway.  Wouldn't it be nice if you can just swap out the transducer with out having to fish it from stern to stem? Maybe you can, are there unit where you can just change the transducer?"

996592,Mister G,2017-03-10 11:51:00,1429,"I was sitting a ton of perch, that was not one or two fish on the graph but a large school that stretched for about a 1/4 mile. And yes the lake was a little rough that day.  I thought this was about sharing info for those who want to learn more about interpreting sonar readings, not a pissing match.  Zooming in is a big benefit to identify a species that you are targeting because of their bladders. When the unit is tuned in correctly using the proper adjustments of sensitivity, ping speed, surface clutter, noise rejection, color line, temp line and scroll speed it's then possible to get the most out of the unit you own.  When first learning how to use a graph, it might be better to use the auto mode but eventually it's much better to learn the tuning adjustments on manual to get the most out of your unit. Auto mode will never get you there.  Now each and every unit is a bit different and some manufactures label the setting a bit different but the bottom line is to learn YOUR unit and what it can do for you. Of course the higher end units can do more so it's up to the angler on how much you want from the unit and how much you are willing to spend.  As I have told many others who want me teach them how to use their units I installed for them, take the owners manual with you on the water and PLAY with the unit as much as possible. Whenever the fish quit biting you should be making adjustment to your unit to optimize it for that day's fishing. By continuing to do this you will eventually become comfortable with it and it's reading on the screen.  No one can actually say, ""only use zoom or never use zoom or don't use the surface clutter adjustment, etc because of all the different units on the market, how much power yours has compared to someone else's AND the water you are fishing in that day may be different. Heck, my unit has adjustments for general use, slow trolling, fast trolling, shallow water, deep water, fresh water, clear water, ice fishing and a few other modes so I can't specifically tell you how to set up your unit if it's not exactly the same as the one I am using this year.  READ the owners manual 2-3 times before hitting the water and PLAY PLAY PLAY with it until you think you know what you are doing. It's fun learning how much is in these little boxes.  My next unit will have that ""Fish Bite"" button on it that I keep writing Lowrance to add. . . . . LOL  Then there is the GPS mapping for units that have that feature that can not only return you to the exact same spot where you caught them last year but also bring back home safely in a thick fog. Great feature for those who fish large lakes in open water."
996594,manitoubass2,2017-03-10 12:35:00,11391,"My first unit was for ice fishing, lowrance elite 4x  I had a horrible time setting it up at first. It was Terry that helped me dial it in(thanks again Terry!)  Turns out, most my difficulties came because I was setting it up in heavy current, not the easiest thing to new for a electronics newbie.  Then I went out on the lake and set it up and holy crap, night and day difference! Hammered walleye on rainy lake with my buddy Stan. I could see exactly what was going on in the water column and I caught alot more fish because of it!  One thing I love, sitting on a school of fish, is watching how they react to your lures. That in turn helped me refine a few ""new to me"" fishing styles that turned out to be incredibly effective for walleye and crappie.  Now it's hard to go without. It's just an adult video game"

You can literally see it bite your lure on the flasher. My eyes dart from the screen to the tip of the rod just in time to see the bite. Crappies are the best for this cause of their tendency to vertically bite. Watch that rod go straight."

996327,Big Cliff,2017-03-06 19:18:00,6899,"I had a really interesting talk with my son the other day, he was having trouble with his fish finder and couldn't understand what he was doing wrong. We spent a long time talking on the phone about it. He wasn't doing anything wrong, he just didn't understand how to interpret what he was seeing. That prompted me to post this!  How many people REALLY know what they are seeing on their units? When should you see an arch, when shouldn't you? How big a target can you see, what's the proper scroll speed, why is there a solid line a foot or so off bottom when I'm still fishing..... The list is endless!  A few of the things we discussed are learning how to interpret what you are actually seeing; when I got my Lawrence HDS 5 the first thing I did was take it for a boat ride. I found a nice deep spot, stopped the boat and dropped the anchor over the side and let out about 15' of rope, then I played with the settings until I could see the anchor. Then I dropped the anchor to the bottom and started working with jigs until I could see a 1/8 oz jig head..... ok, you get the idea, I learned to understand what I was seeing.  Next, I dropped a weight with a line attached and a float so the float was about 10' off the bottom and I trolled back and forth over it so I understood what the arches meant. In short I spent a good part of an afternoon simulating what I might see in real life, the result was I could read that sonar as if it was a book, weed clusters, hard bottom soft bottom, larger fish, bait clouds, that unit and I became best fishing buddies and there were plenty of times I'd go out and pound them while other guys would be catching a fish or two.  How many people mount them, turn them on but never really understand what they are seeing? Got some tips? Post them!"

996364,aplumma,2017-03-06 23:36:00,6896,Time on the water with a controlled environment is the key. I actually took a fish and put 4 oz of weight and lowered it thru the transducer field to see what a fish looks like vs floating debris. The other key is to be able to grasp the concept of what the bottom is made of by reading the strength of the returns and what adjustments are doing. I have spent countless days just reading the water looking for future spots to fish based on the environment rather than looking for fish.

You have your transducer mounted at the stern along with a down rigger, letting the ball out on 100 feet of cable will show that the ball is at the 100 foot depth but because it is angled back because of the resistance of the water and the speed of the boat it may actually be at 85 feet. It is the same with marking fish, depending on the frequency of the transducer the area of the cone it sees will vary, so, it may look like the fish are scattered between 80 and a 100 feet deep, but in actuality they may all be precisely at 80 feet with the ones dead centre in the middle of the cone marking at the true depth and those at the edges of the diameter of the cone marking deeper than their actual depth."

996403,AKRISONER,2017-03-07 14:04:00,5558,"after watching Aaron wiebe on Uncut Angling, I would argue that there are few people who can work a sonar like he does. Well aside from pros that is. I wish i could read side imaging as well as he does.  For the most part the tech in my boat is primitive, so the sonar is used to find structure, depths and temperatures. For the most part the spots we fish we are watching the depth and contours to see what the structure looks like.  Basically any time we fish, we first check the charts for variation, im a very very firm believer that fish hold to structure with options. I.e. Shallow with deep water near by and places to hide with something to eat close by.  I will say that it is rare for us to mark bass on the unit...however when i really think about it 2 of my most impressive moments fishing were literally both due to my ability to notice something on the graph.  The first one was fishing in november for smallies. We came across a spot that had produced before but I think for whatever reason we never took note of the structure there...sure enough on the edge of a deeper basin we saw a distinctive hump that came up sharply from 30 feet to 20 and had one of the biggest bait clouds I had ever seen fishing shallowish structure. We tossed swimbaits out over the hump, let them sink down to bottom and then proceeded to swim our swimbaits up over the hump...what happened was a 20lb bag in my next 5 casts.  Second time was this fall we drove towards a reef with 30FOW of water around it and sure enough 10 seconds into our troll around the reef to look at the structure we marked an arch so big that it had two fish icons on it. Stalled the boat and dropped the drop shot right down to bottom...within seconds tap...tension...hook set and i caught my PB pickerel coming in at 9lbs. I can honestly say that without the graph on both of those occasions we may have not caught the fish at all without electronics.  All said fishies got lip piercings and went back to get even bigger.   When fishing open water trolling with downriggers...if you dont have your graph you are basically aiming blind and praying...we find the thermocline and put the balls to it. checking the depth of the balls using the sonar to ensure that we have the thermocline encased both up and down with lures. If you start marking fish, we are trying to hit them with the ball."

BINGO, we have a winner!  This is the kind of thing I'm talking about ""Understanding what you are seeing"".  so, Why do fish show up as an arch when you are trolling? The transducer picks up the fish at a distance = lower signal further away. You get closer = stronger signal and less far away, and as you move away from the fish the signal lessens and becomes farther away. (weak WEAK weak). Good job dave524!
