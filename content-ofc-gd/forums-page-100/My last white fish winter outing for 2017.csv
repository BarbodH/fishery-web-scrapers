They will spend a whole day to make the trip worth while, while I can just head out for a 4 hour tour and be home in minutes.  I have so many access points to get out on.  I try to help when I can, but I wont give my/our GO to spots. I have a few close friends that we share spots. Never will we abuse this.  When there was safe ice to me, I was on it. No mater if I was catching herring or perch til the deeper waters firmed up. I dont think I missed a weekend once the ice started to form. Got out with some buds. Naw,Jer,Tybo,High Drifter,Walleyed, and my oldest son,  oh and Terry. He has been MIA the past few weeks.  To bad,as I know he would of had a great time out with us.  The past 2 days I have fished with Walleyed. We have a spot we fish and it can be very productive this time of year. It has become our go to spot the last 2 years.  I fished it friday and got my 2. Yesterday was a window shopping day for the fish. This morning well, it was white fish smash.  He had the hot rod going 10/12 and I, 2/3. The funny part was, he was only 40 ft from me and 3 fow difference. He has the next 3 days to fish,I am back to work after a 3 day long weekend. I wish him well til closer.  Im not done with the ice yet though. There are perch to be had come next weekend. I dont target them during the big fish season. I dont even target lakers, even though I fish some waters that have the odd shallow ones roaming around , I would sooner have a good feed of whities.  On a side note, I have to say how impressed I am with my new Artic Armour float suit. Never have I been so warm, sometimes to warm. The suit wore like a Armoni suit. Soft and very comfortable. As many of the suits these days, there are way to many pockets.   I had stuff in  them and would reach in and say, oh, there you are. Or when I came in it was, where the hell did I put my truck keys.  So even though many didnt like the way mother nature was this winter, I am satisfied with my season.

996759,manitoubass2,2017-03-12 17:59:00,11391,Nice job Brian!!!  This was the first year I can remember not being on the ice at all. Quite the bummer.  But I seen alot of great reports so that helped

996802,Rizzo,2017-03-13 02:03:00,4754,Nice way to end a great season. But those extra pockets can get really annoying when you are trying to find something!
996805,GBW,2017-03-13 02:50:00,8460,"Mr B I had to live through you and the others this winter as I never found a day I was off that I could get out to a safe spot locally.  Thank you fine sir for all the reports you share.  Me, now, heading to my folks place next weekend with the kids and I AM bringing my gear just so I can say I hit the ice and tried IF it's safe."
996806,Sinker,2017-03-13 02:55:00,8692,"I agree with conditions. I didnt miss a weekend or day off due to bad ice. Always somewhere safe for me. I havent spent a lot of time fishin whities, but im a perch addict. I have caught a couple though. Headed out for the next 3 days hardcore tho, so hoping to slam a few to end the season!!  S."
996814,Acountdeleted,2017-03-13 11:48:00,2562,Damn bud. Another great outing. I don't know how you dial them in so well but it continues to impress.  Great job on icing those whities this year. Looks like you had a few really good meals.
996845,AKRISONER,2017-03-13 16:49:00,5558,"my last trip...possibly of the year was this weekend as well...i dont know about you, but im ready to throw a cast softwater time cant come soon enough.  Thanks for the report."
