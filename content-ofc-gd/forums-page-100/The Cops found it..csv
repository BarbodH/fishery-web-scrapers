Now that I have wheels again, I can take my time and wait them out. I want the salvage on the Avalanche, so that I can part it out and hopefully recoup some of the monies; that I know I wont get paid for from the insurance. Besides that 5.3 engine would fit right into my 50 Chevy. LOL The odometer on the 17 just turned 125 kilometers this morning on the way to the shop.

There's no mention of the hardwired, bolted too accessories that were installed on the truck; too the tune of better then a grand to replace. The low mileage on the drive train, that a salvage yard will get a grand for the engine alone. Not to be greedy; but I think I'll counter offer with their cash offered and the salvage rights to the Avalanche. But I'm going to wait a few days to respond to them; they're still paying storage on the truck and it may make them a little more cooperative in their negotiations to get out of the storage fees and close this claim?

It's not racist or anything to ask an honest question.  So anyhow the murder occured sometime between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. OPP came in hot, evacuated the whole area. Apperently the OPP were heavenly armed. A suspect was arrested late yesterday afternoon.  Sounds like something gnarly went down.

Anywhere within an hours drive from the reserve is fair game as they don't like to go too far from the reserve. However, they prefer larger cities (easier to find what they need) with back roads back to the reserve. London, Hamilton, Brantford, St Catherines, etc are all prime targets with backroads back to the reserve. It makes little sense to target small towns due to much lower odds of finding targets and heading north east of Hamilton is a poor choice because of the much greater risk of being caught on the way back to the reserve.

Just like all facets of any society there is no more or less criminal element there as anywhere else. The high percentage are good hard working law abiding folks. I don't understand when someone says they won't drive there after dark. Most of the vehicles I see after dark are the Six Nations Police. I feel safer there after dark than many neighborhoods in Toronto for sure.

996096,fishing n autograph,2017-03-03 15:46:00,2540,Not outsmarting. Playing politics and whenever they are confront the escalate to the point where public safety is compromised. I can tell you that my life and those on the roads are more important than stopping someone in your car.

All I can say is, my best friend had his dad's suburban stolen from the mall parking lot in London, and it was found on the same reserve.  A little worse condition.  This was 12 years ago.  The truck was repaired by the insurance company.  But it was only 5 or 6 years old, and souped up a little.  His dad liked it a lot, as it was néw to him only a year earlier. So he really wanted it back."

Hopefully the insurance company writes it off and gives you a fair settlement. That truck won't be the same again.  It's frustrating to hear about that red tape FishNautographs, but good on you guys for trying to do what you can and acknowledging the problem."

The rez's and crap in southern Ontario are highly civilized places with lots of money, infrastructure and services near by.  Im from Flin Flon, when you take the bus from Winnipeg you go to the land where the Rez's dont have names, they are simply numbers placed in the forest somewhere amongst the muskeg. The closest grocery store is a 5 hour drive. They are so far removed there isnt even a car to steal to try make a living.  That my friends is the real deal.

What a royal pain in the arse considering I was located in Hamilton at the time.. I didn't take the first offer from the insurance company so I ended up with a bit more money but still not enough to get anything without another loan. The sad thing is that most of the people on the rez know who's doing the crime but won't say anything. There's no political motivation to go after the thieves either... It disrupts your life and finances and results in higher insurance premiums.. No wonder the guy in Binbrook took the law into his own hands when he shot a guy trying to steal his truck..

What happens to a criminal that gets caught and convicted on First Nations Land? Do they go through a separate incarceration system?  I am not trying to stir anything up, just curious about the process because I do not know. I recently heard of one situation where a person DUI caused death and got 10 years in prison.

995995,Tom S,2017-03-02 15:00:00,362,"  What the hell does that mean?  http://www.polksheriff.org/FAQSFIGURES/Pages/AutoThefts.aspx ""Who Steals Cars? There are four main types of car thieves: CRIMINALS: Burglars, robbers or drug dealers seeking temporary transportation that police cannot trace to the criminals. DRUG USERS: Thieves who make quick cash for drugs by selling the car or parts from it. PROFESSIONALS: Thieves who sell stolen car parts to body shops, smuggle popular cars out of the state or change identification numbers and sell the cars within the state. JOY RIDERS: Teenagers and younger children seeking thrills or looking for transportation for a night on the town.""   The organized crime that is (unfortunately) run off some of the reservations in Southern Ontario would fall nicely into your criminals and professionals categories. Some get used in other crimes and then dumped or burned, some get chopped and sold, and the higher end vehicles get shipped out of the country. Sad to see because it causes a whole culture to be painted with the same brush, but around here's if you vehicle is missing it's most likely going to shop up on or around the res."
995996,Mister G,2017-03-02 15:06:00,1429,"Question, did this Chevy truck have a chip in the key or not ? ? ?"
995997,AKRISONER,2017-03-02 15:19:00,5558,"I wasnt going to touch this issue, but Scuro's comment I feel needs a straight forward response before this gets off the rails.  Scuro having spoken directly with an OPP officer who patrols brant county, the issue is directly related to bullet number 3. These are professionals operating ""chop shops"" on reserve land.  No one has insinuated race in this thread. In fact I can almost guarantee that there are white folks that are the beneficiaries of this organized crime. The low level employees of this chop shop on reserve land are most likely indigenous due to their location, however it is very very obvious that the parts from these vehicles are being shipped off reserve, how many sets of wheels and car parts could residents of the reserve need? Go up 3 levels of hierarchy in the organized crime ring and race becomes a non factor here.  The only complaints I have seen so far are with the thieves being thieves and with organized crime. If you are a proponent of organized crime and thievery then I would hope that you express your advocacy in front of everyone in this thread."
995999,miami,2017-03-02 15:30:00,29,"This is a sad documentary of past treaties. The Res Police are sworn in as Police. Start Policing and I mean start by hunting these thieves down and arresting them. (After reading about the number of vehicles the Tow operator has to pick up, IMO someone on that Res is looking the other way.) Further, the Chief of any Res that knows and condones this type of activity should be arrested and charged.  He/She should be outraged and embarrassed by a small faction of Native Canadians on that or any Res where this is taking place.  Dan, I feel for ya. It's happened to me. Stick to your guns and keep us updated."
996002,DanD,2017-03-02 15:34:00,2223,"No this truck had ""passlock"" anti theft system; where the key is not chipped. ""Pass-Key is the system that uses a resistor chip in the key. Passlock works like this, when an undamaged ignition lock is turned by the proper key; the lock generates a small voltage, that is sent to the instrument cluster. If that voltage is the same as previous voltages sent; the cluster sends a message to the BCM (Body control module). The BCM then sends a signal to the PCM (Powertrain control module); telling it to allow injector pulse. The thieves must have a way to mimic that voltage sent to the cluster? I'm assuming this because the cluster was unbolted and just laying in its normal posistion.  Dan."
996004,DanD,2017-03-02 15:49:00,2223,"I was talking to my niece, who is a correctional officer at the Brantford jail. The story she gets from the inmates, that are there for vehicle theft; is that they are hired and taught how to steel the vehicles. Once they got whatever they were sent out for; they arrange a meeting with the next level up. The thief gets payed and next level takes it to a chop shop. Whether the chop shop is on the res or not who knows; but most times the vehicles get dumped there? True or not, I don't know; it's what the inmates are telling her?  Dan."
996006,Terry,2017-03-02 15:54:00,14456,"Well if you can't trust an inmate, who can you trust lol"
996007,DanD,2017-03-02 15:55:00,2223,^^^^ LOL  Dan.
996009,BillM,2017-03-02 16:10:00,17367,"Goodluck Dan, I hope they total it for you."

Dan.  the OPP officer i was speaking with indicated that the chop shops were actively operating on 6 nations. They have multiple locations and where the cars are at any time is anyones guess. There is nothing illegal about having a garage in an empty building. the cars move in and then are gone and the activities switch to another location. There is indeed 0 doubt though that these robberies are related to larger crime syndicates. the ones doing the stealing are simply employees."
996020,John Bacon,2017-03-02 18:08:00,3277," If they don't write the truck off, I'm sending it to a GM dealer, where my wife works as a service adviser. I also know all the techs there and they've all been given the heads up; as to what I want to happen.  Dan That may be your best option.  I was offered $200 as a trade-in for the 2005 GMC Jimmy.  I am sure you will get more than that from insurance; but you won't be buying a current model truck with the insurance money.  My guess is that the insurance will want to write it off.  But I don't think you will be getting a lot of money for a 12 year old GM truck."
995895,DanD,2017-03-01 18:31:00,2223,"Got a call this morning from the cops, that they found my stolen truck; it was on the Chippewa Res. just outside of London. Went out to the towing companies compound to have a look at my poor baby.             I'm pretty sure they're going to write the truck off; but if they don't, there will be a crap storm heading for them. I'm not a shoe maker type of mechanic; I mean I look after my vehicles and I know that I could have jumped in that truck at anytime and go anywhere I wanted to go. Every squeak, rattle, engine/trans issues, let alone the electronics, are going to have to be back to proper working order before I will sign off on the truck. Looking at the truck I don't want it back; due to the abuse it was likely put through. Things that may only show up a year down the road? Thanks for the read; I had to vent.  Dan."
995897,Raf,2017-03-01 18:35:00,3495,terrible  i'm surprised it wasn't a burnt out shell to be honest.  good luck with the ins. company.
995898,DRIFTER_016,2017-03-01 18:45:00,10439,Dan What year is the truck? I used to work for a place that did insurance repairs and can guesstimate if they will write it off or not.
995899,grimsbylander,2017-03-01 18:55:00,3016,That's nasty. The total disregard for other people's property and the lack of caring for inflicting undue hardship is disgusting.
995900,DanD,2017-03-01 18:55:00,2223,2005 Avalanche Z71 with a 183K on it; low mileage for a 05.  Dan.
995901,GBW,2017-03-01 19:04:00,8460,Dan I don't blame you for the venting AND I too wouldn't want it back.  Good luck man!
995903,manitoubass2,2017-03-01 19:09:00,11391,Wow! I'm bummed for you.  Such a horrible thing
995904,AKRISONER,2017-03-01 19:33:00,5558,i hate that they took the wheels off and a few other pieces and just left it...what a waste.  I am at least glad that the cops are going into the res and doing work. My understanding was that they didnt even bother.
995906,DanD,2017-03-01 19:46:00,2223,Chippawa's have their own police force on the Res. I service a number of their cruisers. Regular OPP wouldn't dare going on the Res; that be just looking for trouble.  Dan.
995907,Sinker,2017-03-01 19:47:00,8692,"No surprise where it was found. Hope they write it off, i wouldnt take it back either"
995908,DRIFTER_016,2017-03-01 19:59:00,10439,Dan I believe it could go either way with the insurance. Depending on what they value the vehicle at. It's too close to call. Hopefully it all works out for you. Thieves suck and should have their hands chopped off when caught.
995910,DanD,2017-03-01 20:06:00,2223,I'd recommend another part of their anatomy; using the dull side of a butter knife! That way they couldn't breed any more like themselves.  Dan.
995911,manitoubass2,2017-03-01 20:11:00,11391,A thief is one of the lowest forms of scum.   Sincerely hope it's a right off
995913,leaf4,2017-03-01 20:20:00,2466,"Ouch that hurts... Too bad, with it being a 12 year old truck I don't think it'll be a stretch to say it is written off... Especially when no one has any idea what it's been put through."
995914,limeyangler,2017-03-01 20:25:00,5204,"Damn, that sucks...i'd be soooooo pissed too, hope the Insurance come through for you, hope they nail the scumbags too!"
995922,huzzsaba,2017-03-01 21:28:00,884,"I have had 2 vandalisms (not straight out stolen) , but once that happens, you get this weird feel every time you step into the car even though its all fixed up.Sorry to hear that happened to you Dan.  Even if they don""t write it off, I am guessing you can fix it up for cheap with your expertise or you can buy it back if they do write it off."
995923,Old Ironmaker,2017-03-01 21:30:00,8243,"They don't care if they found it on the rez or in front of Parliament Hill. The insurance company will offer you the average Blue Book or NADA value and that's it. Been there done that and have the T shirt. I had a 83' Benz 560 SEC Coupe that was nearly deemed to be antique, showroom condition, it was appraised several thousand above market value that was stolen, never recovered. They offered me the average Blue Book for it, 4 grand less then appraisal. Basically told me take it or leave it or we can go to court and I could pay a lawyer. My lawyer said ""take it"".  I have empathy for you Dan."
995924,Weeds,2017-03-01 21:37:00,782,"That sucks. I'm guessing even if they write it off it probably won't represent the actual value of the truck. Having been fortunate enough to never had to file an insurance claim I wouldn't know but either way, Terrible."
995928,Big Cliff,2017-03-01 21:59:00,6899,"It's not just the truck, what about all the contents, what about the inconvenience..... what about the just plane aggravation of it all. I am so sorry to hear that this happened to you, sometimes I think that Karma just doesn't count, you sure didn't deserve this!  Hope it all works out for you and if I can ever help (and I usually can) just give me a shout!"
995940,Cast-Away,2017-03-02 01:06:00,790,"A- The insurance company will Pay out very based on the age and mileage. A perfectly good vehicle is worth very little at that age.  B- The scumbags that did this should have their hands cut off. Mark a thief for what he or she is.  Why is there are separate police on First Nations Land?  What happens to a criminal that gets caught and convicted on First Nations Land? Do they go through a separate incarceration system?  I am not trying to stir anything up, just curious about the process because I do not know."
995941,npt1,2017-03-02 01:16:00,220,"The Insurance Company's goal is to make a profit. They do that by screwing the customer and the customer has no option , take what they offer you or pay a Lawyer. Try to change Insurance Companys , hah, you will lose again with the cost of premiums charges to you now because you had a claim. The customer lose's either way."

995945,Sinker,2017-03-02 02:00:00,8692,Why not? Its an honest question and im curious what the answer is as well.  S.
995947,Pikeslayer,2017-03-02 02:08:00,1443,"Not true. Insurance companies maintain a collective database for vehicle values. Claims agents make initial value assesments based on their ""experience/decision allowance"". Senior agents have a higher decision allowance. If you're not satisfied with the initial assesments request escalation and be prepared to provide documented comparables (dealership postings of used cars, autotrader listings, receipts for repairs/maintenance/new tires etc). IF YOU DONT ASK, YOU DONT GET.  BTW, don't necessarily expect a broker to go to bat for you. There's no money in it for them. You need to deal directly with the insurer and be persistent.  I would be shocked if they insisted on fixing your vehicle. Do your homework and start researching a fair 'settlement' that you're prepared to settle for."
995948,DRIFTER_016,2017-03-02 02:15:00,10439,"BTW, don't necessarily expect a broker to go to bat for you. There's no money in it for them. You need to deal directly with the insurer and be persistent.    This is untrue. Every time I have had issues with insurance companies my broker bent over backwards to help me out. In the 90's I was in a roll over accident caused by road damage caused by a tornado. The insurance company was going to hold me responsible but after my broker got through with them I wasn't blamed for the accident, I got a few $K more than I paid for my vehicle (they wrote it off) and I was treated like gold.  If you have a broker that won't go to bat for you, change brokers 'cause yours sucks!!"
