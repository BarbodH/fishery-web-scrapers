I looked everywhere and googled places in the states and Canada for a pan. They were hard to find and not cheap, usually in the $100-$150 range. I was in the Ottawa scout shop looking for one and all they had was cast iron, which was the usual conclusion when searching. A customer overheard me and recommended a place in Ottawa called Russell Kitchen supply. I immediately went down and found exactly what I was searching for. A 15"" wide 2-3/4"" tall pan with a long handle. It's carbon steel and very durable, perfect for on an open fire. It had a scratch on the inside and a couple on the bottom so the clerk gave it to me for $13......??????wow Can't wait to try this baby out in the bush.  "
996788,woodenboater,2017-03-12 22:09:00,2277,great price on that pan. I use de Buyer pans fromt Nikolaou in Toronto (Queen and Bathurst area). Great line of cookware from France. Also saw that Lodge makes a pan very similar to de Buyers that were at Basspro.

996917,muskymatt,2017-03-13 23:48:00,2608,This one is French as well. A lot of seasoning to do but it will be put through the paces. Going to try to alter the handle with a hinge system that will allow it to fold.
996968,Joeytier,2017-03-14 20:10:00,3990,"Awesome deal for sure, nice pan.  I'm quite content with cast iron, though I don't do any serious amount of portaging."
996982,Acountdeleted,2017-03-14 23:16:00,2562,Very nice. Did they only agree to give you the discount if you took the banana?  Heck of a deal.
997052,Sinker,2017-03-15 16:58:00,8692,Cooking on a fire without cast iron?? Say whaaaaa??
997054,muskymatt,2017-03-15 17:38:00,2608,"Cooking on a fire without cast iron?? Say whaaaaa?? I only cook at home with cast but after lugging my 15"" cast iron 35kms into the park the last couple of years I said no more lol. Things gotta weigh 20lbs or more. These carbon steel pans are used by chefs in kitchens on gas flame all the time and will work just as well over a wood fire. And at less than 3.5lbs it will be a lot friendlier on the person carrying it on their pack."
