We do well every year but this year the fish  were turned on for us. Most fish came from jigging on deep water humps , shoals and points with morning trolling at first light good for some nice fish. All total our group caught over 300 walleye for the week with 70% of them slot fish in the 20-22"" range ( I love the slot as you can catch many large fish) we had 4 walleye over the slot 25-27"" that were all returned to the lake to grow, our group keep anough for 2 nice fish fries and the rest are still in the lake.  Bass fishing was a little off as most were in the deep water, caught a few nice pike in the 27-31"" range. My best came on the 6th morning when I caught a 25"" over the slot walleye, boy what a great fight on light line."

We just got back from fishing the derby at Crotch Lake ,  I tied for third place with a fish I caught with five minutes to cutoff.  Most of the eyes we got we just under slot but nice fish.  We managed a few bass and a couple nice pike.  We caught them with a mixture of trolling and jigging.  I love this lake , its such a beautiful place and we just keep going back."
