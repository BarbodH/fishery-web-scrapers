114494,bassmaster4,2007-09-17 00:43:00,801,i was watching videos on youtube and came across this at the beggining the fish that arent eating anything or being eaten are those rudd? (the invasive species) this is kind of random but im just curious.  
114497,bassboy,2007-09-17 00:54:00,161,I will not get zoned on youtube videos. I will not get zoned on youtube videos. I will not get zoned on youtube videos.  :lol:  Nice link.  Of course once I am there I went and checked out some other vids too. Had to drag myself away.....  Some neat stuff there......like a 15.5 Kilo pike (34 pounds?).   twas a beeeeeg mawnster.  Bill
114500,Dozer,2007-09-17 01:03:00,896,"That guy is stupid, once the pike started to thrash to swim away, the moron kept holding its tail and pulled it out, then the pike accidentally struck his hand.  Probably the first time he caught a pike."

114538,danw,2007-09-17 03:05:00,72,Eagle Catches pike. link  Saw this video right after the original one ended and it is just as cool.
114556,brandon,2007-09-17 05:17:00,857,too bad that eagle didn't come back down and take one of those kids in return for them takin its fish........i hate when little fools like that interfere with nature
114566,Spiel,2007-09-17 10:39:00,9065,....Yes they appear to be Rudd. I suspect the video was shot some where in Europe.
