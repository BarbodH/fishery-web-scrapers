114347,Photoz,2007-09-16 11:20:00,792,"They'll likely release him on his own recognisance, he'll appear in court several times, then the Crown will allow him to plead guilty to simple (non-violent) theft, and get an extra 90 days probation tacked on. Meanwhile, he's likely cost the taxpayers (you & me) several thousand in legal aid fees, tied up one or 2 cops for several days, tied up the courts, and for what? Reminds me of last spring at Bowmanville . . . .    a guy down from me (it's still quite dark) got a nice trout on . . . . .     2 guys came outta nowhere with a net, and landed it for him . . . ..   THEN SNIPPED HIS LINE & TOOK OFF WITH HIS FISH!! I often fish Port Hope in the wee hours, and you see guys 'cruisin' the riverbank, havin' a good look for unguarded equipment . . . . .    likely just exactly what this jackass was doin,' luckily there was somebody to point him out to the cops, or he'd have likely brazened it out and fished with the stuff for the rest of the day. Just when you think you've seen ot all . . . . . . .    ? (And you DARE give him some frontier justice . . . . .    you are gonna be in more trouble than him, unless of course, you were making a legitimate 'citizen's arrest' and the sucker resisted, THEN you could use the amount of force you deemed necessary to subdue the suspect?)"

114432,Tinman,2007-09-16 19:59:00,376,"Reminds me of a customer I sold a car to a few years back, she and her kids were in a serious accident, rolled her new van, a ""Good Samaritan"" sat the lady down made sure she wouldn't ""hurt"" herself anymore bu getting her to remove all her jewelery and put it in her purse for ""safe keeping"". The ""Good Samaritan"" then made off with her purse and contents. I have no idea what this world is coming too! I hope it gets better before my kids get older!"

114615,Raf,2007-09-17 13:30:00,3495,hope they used a phone book too.
114640,kennyman,2007-09-17 14:31:00,737,"Well, if you gotta go I can only think of one way better. As far as the theif, that's unbelievable. reminds me of the Western movies where they steal the gunfighters boots etc. as soon as he hits the ground. VULTURES!!!"

114735,bigbuck,2007-09-17 18:30:00,2449,"I read about that in Oakville Today over the weekend. That is Repulsive!! This guy is a repeat offender and will probably once again get a slap on the wrist and will be free to go. He's lucky I wasn't around, normally I'm a nice kinda guy but if I were to see that, he'd go in the drink with a mouthful of broken teeth."
114761,Kirk,2007-09-17 19:54:00,347,I guess hes just living up to the family name: Gross
114812,TJQ,2007-09-17 22:45:00,7806,I think the most unbelievable thing about the story is thats it true....

114208,fishindevil,2007-09-15 23:01:00,6254,"Hey everyone i just heard on the 6 o""clock news that a fisherman died at the bronte pier this afternoon,of a  suspected heart attack,  and then falls into the water,while people are trying to save him..  ...are you ready!!!!! and some idiot cast to his rod in the water....snags it reels it in and takes off running with his equipment & tackle and gear.  ......THANKFULLY A 24YR OLD MAN WAS ARRESTED FOR THAT CRIME,THEY GOT HIM.....thanks to the police...man im furious,to think that he calls himself a fisherman....just what we need another reason for people to give us a hard time about things....i cant believe it....poor guy dies and his stuff is stolen.  ...i hope they throw the god-dam book at him....they did not release his name yet...I HOPE HE IS NOT ONE OF OUR MEMBERS....be safe out there  oh ya it was on the channel 8 news  CTV  at 6pm tonight"
114210,PERCHER,2007-09-15 23:02:00,787,Thats just sad.Some people are just sick.
114212,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-15 23:05:00,698,That's horrible. I'd like to think the fishing community is tight knit and respectful of each other. The bad apples spoil it. My condolences go out the deceased mans family.
114215,bassboy,2007-09-15 23:14:00,161,What the h e double hockey sticks is wrong with people?????  *shakes head* I am with you Shawn....I hope he is not someone from here.....   Brutal
114217,brifishrgy,2007-09-15 23:28:00,559,  He may not be a member of this board but he is a member of our society .. its hard to believe someone would actually do something like that
114222,mason05,2007-09-15 23:46:00,258,I can't comprehend how someone could ignore a dying individual and steal his material possessions at the same time.  Some people are just sick.  I too hope they read him the riot act and throw the book at him.  He deserves to be shot and wizzed on.....  Corn Nug

114230,BGis,2007-09-16 00:00:00,15,Hope the all the papers big and small put his picture on the front page.........pathetic
114231,smokinall4s,2007-09-16 00:01:00,89,Some people can be so stupid. I would like to see them tie him to the heaviest fishing line out there and go fishing for great whites. But I think that shark don't even eat scum.
114232,jediangler,2007-09-16 00:02:00,1923,"Personally, I'd much rather kick the bucket while fishing, than driving there on the 401. At least he was doing what we all love and not taking out the trash or raking leaves. Oh yeah, if I go out while fishing, first come first served as far as my gear is concerned."
114257,FinS,2007-09-16 00:37:00,463,unbelievable Arggggggg thats all i have to say
114259,ccmtcanada,2007-09-16 00:38:00,7971,Wow...my condolences to the friends and family of the fisherman.  To the idiot who attempted to steal his gear...you are now shamed for life....jeez...you cant get much lower than that...hope you get what you deserve.

114275,xrap,2007-09-16 00:59:00,683,Sad news indeed. Was out thier today and did not here the story till I read this. And some news on the perosn who did it. Kitchener resident Jamie Harland Gross was charged with theft and two counts of breach of probation. That's if anybody knows him.
114276,Daplumma,2007-09-16 01:00:00,1961,"That has got to be a serious bad karma move there for sure.No worries, that dude will pay for that spades.As for the guy checking out while fishing..not a bad way to go! Joe"

114278,Deano,2007-09-16 01:02:00,767,"it doesn't seem to surprise me, almost every time we here of something awful, the guy/girl has had numerous convictions. Why hasn't a judge done something sooner to prevent these people from re-offending. Then again, it's job security for judges and lawyers."
114280,HTHM,2007-09-16 01:13:00,4082,shows how strong sin is in this world! Hopefully he will repent and change his ways
114281,ccmtcanada,2007-09-16 01:16:00,7971,"Here's the news story from CTV news.  Fishing gear stolen while man lay dying: police  toronto.ctv.ca  A 24-year-old man has been arrested after the fishing gear of an unconscious elderly man was stolen at an Oakville harbour.  Police say the 68-year-old man was fishing at around 5 a.m. at the Bronte Harbour, near Lakeshore Boulevard West and Bronte Road, when he collapsed.  When another fisherman in the area began CPR, the senior's line was reeled in and his rod was stolen.  An ambulance responded to the scene and transported the man to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.  Witnesses at the harbour told police about the theft and the 24-year-old fisherman was arrested shortly after.  Kitchener resident Jamie Harland Gross was charged with theft and two counts of breach of probation.  Gross made his first court appearance on Friday.  http://toronto.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTV...hub=TorontoHome"

114326,CLofchik,2007-09-16 04:30:00,854,"Unbelievable!  Was anybody on the board there?  I stopped by there after work around 4am Thurs night/Fri morn and there was an older guy fishing by the lighthouse, was that him?  There's been some real chuckleheads down there this year.  Drunk kids trying to make off with the life rings, some guy tried walking off with my bike jacket, but stealing a dying guys rod........that's just screwed up."
114327,ecxstriper,2007-09-16 05:17:00,343,I can't believe he calls himself a human let alone a fisherman. What can one say about someone so low and the addtional pain he has cuased to the family of the deceased .  Figures he was already on probation.
114340,Spiel,2007-09-16 10:02:00,9065,"....Brutal, sad in more ways than one."
