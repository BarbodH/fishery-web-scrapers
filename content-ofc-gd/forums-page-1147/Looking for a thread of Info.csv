114660,Sherriff,2007-09-17 15:08:00,252,I recall a thread to basically resolve the issue about fishing within a marina.  Who owns the water and can they legally kick you out if you are fishing from a boat and not bouncing jigs off anything...Basically just being a responsible boater and fisherman and doing no harm.  Any help would be great.  Thanks  Sherriff
