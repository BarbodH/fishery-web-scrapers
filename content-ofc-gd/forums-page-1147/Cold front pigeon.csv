114540,tbayboy,2007-09-17 03:08:00,1497,"Mikeh and I hooked up to try some new water on the north end of pigeon Saturday.  When I got to mikes place his first comment was 'hope you got something warm to wear'.  Holy cow, I guess my mind just didn't want to admit it was really going to be so cold but without the sun and the wind blowing - wow.  We spent the first hour or two trying in some open(ish) water spots.  I managed to catch the line of a couple camping on the island who had just tossed a line out and tied it to the shore - I was a bit miffed but left the line for them after getting everything untangled.  This line catching skill would come to play later (ooh foreshadowing!).  Anyhow after that I figured I should take a pic of the local osprey in case it was the only thing we got:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1230/1394618490_d4520163fe_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Pigeon Lake Osprey"" /></a>  Lucikly Mike broke the skunk a bit later with this little guy off some shallow rock piles to break the skunk:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1047/1394619980_512c9b26ff_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""First fish"" /></a>  Then we headed for some more secluded areas where the wind wouldn't bother us (as much anyhow).  I started tossing a plastic lizard that had never produced for me so I was happy to have this guy take a gulp:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1177/1394620984_5d930d62bd_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""The lizard wins"" /></a>  Note the broken shades - guess these $20 sunglasses really live up to the price paid  A little while later my wacky rigged senko took off in a hurry.  Surprise:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1408/1394622092_d728c84eb4_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Baby muskie"" /></a>  A little later Mike pulled the classic setup lure, put lure over side of boat, realize you hadn't yet tied lure to line, hang head in shame maneuver.   Doh.  But we thought that the lure sacrifice would help out and it looked good:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1330/1393728493_6d5f4ac698_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Little largie"" /></a>  But that was the last for the day... or was it?  Mike got another nice one that was released before I got to take a picture of it.  Some might say by released I mean it spat the hook at the side of the boat but it was a slow day so it counts.  Then came the keeper of the day - Mike had a bit of a case of 'frozen hands' and all I heard was a not safe for prime time exclamation followed by the sight of a very nice rod and reel floating by.  I tried to be the hero and grabbed the net only to hit the rod on the top with the net and sink it even faster as the wind dragged us away from it.  Long story short just about at the point of giving up I saw a long skinny braided weed in the water - oh wait thats the line!  Unfortunately the bail was opened so after a couple hundred yards of dragging we had our only keeper of the day:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1277/1394617402_db2d2213f5_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Back in its owners hands"" /></a>  Not a lot of fish to be found and wearing gloves this early in September seemed a bit depressing but hey, still beats sitting inside right?"
114552,fatherof3,2007-09-17 04:26:00,1769,always better than sitting inside
114574,Blake,2007-09-17 11:15:00,418,Great report and nice going getting the rod and reel back
114597,ccmtcanada,2007-09-17 12:48:00,7971,Hey there Sean....great report as usual.  It was a cold front day that's for sure!  At least you got into some fish and got that little ski as well.  So...who got to keep that rod and reel??  Did you arm wrestle for it?? LOL.  We should do lunch soon...and tell some fishing stories....haha.
114603,Bitsmith2k,2007-09-17 12:58:00,396,nice sean..  nice plastic lizard.. those things are great
114617,Raf,2007-09-17 13:32:00,3495,"good stuff guys.  i am hoping to hit pigeon a little later in the year.  sure is nice this time of year though, them tourists are mostly gone!"
114661,tbayboy,2007-09-17 15:11:00,1497,"Well since I was the one who sunk it with the net I figured I'd let Mike keep it (that and the fact that I'm on his boat too  - captain's always wins right?). Lunch anytime, just drop me a pm.     Yeah wonder who hooked me on those guys eh? First thing I thought when the largie grabbed it was ""about time Bitsmith's 'go to' lure worked"" - been lugging those damn things around every since you schooled me with them on Stoney (we gotta do that again)"
114664,Bitsmith2k,2007-09-17 15:24:00,396," ya man.. after this weekend, i'm free most sundays.. lemme know"
114677,LeXXington,2007-09-17 15:59:00,1928,"Great going sean, I saw that weather said not for me  don't worry Mike been there done that.."
114792,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-17 21:30:00,0,Definately a tough weekend to fish. But looks like you guys caught a few. Good job!
