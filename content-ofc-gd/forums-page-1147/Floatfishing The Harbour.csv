113929,solopaddler,2007-09-14 20:13:00,8605,"Went fishing with my good buddy Dave this morning hoping to tie into some salmon. This time of year we usually start out tossing hardware then switch to the float gear once things slow down... After a bit of a slow start and some searching Dave managed to hook the first fish on a chrome/blue Rattlin' Spot.     I was getting tons of hits, but nothing solidly hooked so decided to switch up to floatfishing with giant chunks of skein.  Hard to tell in that pic, but that's a 4/0 hook, and one big honkin' chunk-o-roe!. Salmon seem to like it though.... Not long after that I managed to get a good bend in the long stick   .   With a little bit of trouble we finally managed to net the beast.  Dave switched over and we immediately started missing fish left and right. They were slurping back the skein chunks like it was candy! Finally managed to land another beaut', this one a little cleaner...    For a while there it was total mayhem with quite a few fish either missed or hooked, an awesome morning for sure!  cheers,  Mike"

Then there are guys like BITE ME 38 years of experience lose the fish tell fish stories and no fish pics to entertain  the people on OFC.  Thanks for the entertaining pics Mike  MTP

114044,007,2007-09-15 02:12:00,537,Nice fish!  Never thought about using rattlin shads for Salmon.  Must give that a go!
114052,wallacio,2007-09-15 02:44:00,475,  Good eye...I was using a Kwikfish earlier and I pinched on a few splitshot to get it down.   I left them on when I switched back to the Rattlin' Rap as I wanted it to run as deep as possible as we were fishing in bright conditions.   It was running just off bottom and I was getting a ton of hits on it.
114063,mikeymikey,2007-09-15 03:54:00,376, Thanks for a quality tip.
114067,stevetso,2007-09-15 04:07:00,11,Nice fish!!  Any way you can pass a little info as to where that was?  Have tried looking for fishable shore waters but so far no success.  Need to prove to the Mrs. that I was actually fishing and not...  Any help provided would be greatly appreciated!  Cheers and nice to meet you all!! Steve (just moved to TO and am very glad to bumped into this forum)
