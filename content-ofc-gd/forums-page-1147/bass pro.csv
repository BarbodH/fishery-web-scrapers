114594,motv8tr,2007-09-17 12:38:00,2587,"No,as ffar as I know the only place you'll find that is in their sales flyers, click on the link for the Vaughn store, or type in Bass Pro shops Vaughn on google and it'll take you there.  Maureen"
114663,Rich,2007-09-17 15:19:00,3927,Go on Google and look up a currency converter. Keep it open in another window and use it to get a better idea of what the prices will be in Canadian currency.
114672,drwxr,2007-09-17 15:48:00,453,"i wish it was simple as this, but its not how it works. the prices in toronto bass pro is way higher than on website in US dollars. my guess is the shipping and other custom fees.  (last year i bought waders at bass pro for $69, while in website it was 35US.)"
114676,MJL,2007-09-17 15:58:00,2427,"No clue as to why BassPro prices would be so different for their in-house brand items.  As far as other products, I've only seen considerable difference in prices between Shimano Canada and Shimano US and PowerPro.  Other than those examples, everything else seems on par with what we can get here in Canada."
114680,mooseroo,2007-09-17 16:07:00,80,That's my biggest complaint with Bass Pro up here in Toronto too! I wish they had a CDN$ online store. I'd be up there much more frequently if I could see the prices from home and create  shopping list.
114687,Terry,2007-09-17 16:26:00,14456,"yup, sometimes things are double the price..for no reason.... the odd time it's because of duty from other countries but often it seems to be ""lets rip off the dumb Canadians"".........  not just PBS, it's every tackle store around or the distributors, try for every cent they can get from us"
114690,mooseroo,2007-09-17 16:30:00,80,I've seen a few of CDN mail-order places that have much better pricing (in Canada) than the local/larger shops. i think I'll start looking to them for tackle over the winter. I'll post experiences with them.
