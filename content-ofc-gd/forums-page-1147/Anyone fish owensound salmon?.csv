114388,Fishmaster,2007-09-16 15:06:00,920,Looked in the river the other day only seen 2 little salmon i would say that its tough fishing ...i have never seen so little fish in all my life and a empty river in the fall ..
114393,drwxr,2007-09-16 15:24:00,453,blame indians and their nets.
114421,Canuck2fan,2007-09-16 18:16:00,1444, C'mon now we all know that the natives who net are all enviormentalists and not the problem  ....  That being said if you really want to place blame it should be on the idiots who run to the reserves and buy the fish that are netted. That also goes for the restaurants who illegally purchase it and resell it.
114483,boatman,2007-09-17 00:16:00,350,I fished the harbour on Thursday. We caught one salmon in 60 FOW when we first arrived at about 6:00 pm. Then not even a bite for the next two hours. Talked to a couple other anglers at the launch who said they had a flurry of action at the same time.  Didn't see any salmon in the rivers.
114484,glen,2007-09-17 00:22:00,2641,Thanks for the replies.  The derby people report better fishing then last year.  Maybe we are on the up swing.
