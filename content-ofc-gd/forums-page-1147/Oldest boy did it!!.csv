114251,fatherof3,2007-09-16 00:33:00,1769,"Took the oldest boy down to fish tonight.After his reel failing him the other day I told him I would hook one and hand him my rod.We got down there and it was a perfect evening.  Not even 5 minutes after we started I got a fish on.I handed him the rod and stood back.I offered suggestions as he went and I have to say he did a great job.He let it run when it wanted to and held it when he should.I was very impressed with how he fought this fish.Here is some pics throughout the fight ending with one very happy young man.           After that it was my turn and go figure that was the only fish of the night.I don't care,I caught plenty of carp this week and this night was about him.He loved fighting a bigger fish and wants more."

114256,ccmtcanada,2007-09-16 00:36:00,7971,Wow...the look of determination on his face while fighting the fish and that HUGE smile with the fish is just priceless.  Big congrats to your son...you must be a very proud dad tonight.

114284,Bly,2007-09-16 01:22:00,1556,The first big one stays with you forever. Great smile and nice fish!
114292,smokinall4s,2007-09-16 01:32:00,89,Tell your son way to stick it out. Eventually the big one comes and for him it was tonight. Great pics of him reeling it in dad. I find that when my kids start to get bored or discouraged I take the rod and once I hook one I then give them the rod to reel it in. Next thing you know they are fishing again.  Congrats to your son. Keep up the good work.
114294,MJL,2007-09-16 01:38:00,2427,That fish is a real beauty.  Your son fought it like a pro.  WTG!
114298,tbayboy,2007-09-16 01:51:00,1497,"Great stuff, now the competition is on"
114301,Beans,2007-09-16 01:53:00,3339,Hey fatherof3...great report...thanks for posting and sharing your son's excitement with us...
114313,fatherof3,2007-09-16 03:09:00,1769,"he says thank you and I forgot to mention that he was happy to be on ""the fishing site"",lol"
114314,huntervasili,2007-09-16 03:13:00,1604,WTG on the water... Nice to see you continually allow your children to be involved in the great sport... everyone knows a kid on the water is better than a kid on the street and its better for him to be addicted to something like that than anything else... thats the way I explain it anyway!!!
114315,canadian_copper,2007-09-16 03:15:00,925,GREAT JOB GUYS
114316,xrap,2007-09-16 03:33:00,683,AWSOME JOB GUYS!!!!

114321,markiemark70,2007-09-16 04:13:00,158,"Hey fatherof3, nice job. love your reports, one suggestion though, if i may. Just use thier names. oldest boy/youngest boy seems so impersonal!"
114369,aplumma,2007-09-16 14:11:00,6896,nice fish I am glad you all are fishing together it will be something to always look back on and smile.   Art
114377,wolfville,2007-09-16 14:25:00,396,How old is he? Those were a few pictures that would be priceless few years later when he looks back on how he landed his first big one. I'll have to show my son (7 years old) this thread so he gets more confidence next time he is landing a carp.
114390,Rich,2007-09-16 15:14:00,3927,Awesome!
