Weather could not have been better with only a slight breeze and partly cloudy skies.  The main action for smallies came off of 8-12 foot breaks with deeper water around.  The best baits for the day were Phenix Tubes, Jackall jerkbaits and also the new One Knocker crankbait.  We caught well over 30 fish with the biggest ones between 3-4lbs besides 1 good size sheephead LOL.  Nothing huge but a great time out there.  Here are a couple of pics      "
