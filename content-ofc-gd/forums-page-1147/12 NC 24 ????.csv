114592,Entropy,2007-09-17 12:23:00,747,I'm trying to find a bolt to fit a thread in piece of equipment.  I used my neighbour's tap and die set and found that the one that worked was 12 NC 24.  What size of bolt is this??  Help?  Entropy
114593,Roy,2007-09-17 12:37:00,13728,Check with one of our tool and die guys but I'd say 11/64ths.
114600,Whopper,2007-09-17 12:54:00,2174,Roy is correct on the dia of the hole size. First number you gave is the bolt size (#12) and the second is the # of threads per inch I believe
114605,Uncle Buck,2007-09-17 13:00:00,1000,"12-24 is a real oddball  i've been doing tool and die for almost 15 years, and never heard/seen one... i had to check the machinery handbook to see if it exists...  10-24 is a standard screw, readily available...  If you're looking for the 12-24...  try brafasco, Fabory, Fastenal, Bolt and Nut Supply...  Good Luck"
114613,Entropy,2007-09-17 13:12:00,747,Thanks guys!
114623,blaque,2007-09-17 13:46:00,2419,"Hopefully its legible, but heres some info on that, 12-24 NC.........12 is the diameter-24 is the threads per inch, and the NC is a course thread (as opposed to NF which is fine thread)    "
114627,BITEME,2007-09-17 13:53:00,1969,"12-24NC  12 is the bolt, 24 is the thread, nc is is coarse you will need a #16 drill, decimal equivalent ,.1770 probable hole size .1805, 66%of thread. a 3/8 drill will work all bolts can be found at brafasco, fastenal or other similar place"
114657,POLLIWOGG,2007-09-17 15:06:00,835,"You got a tap and die set right in front of you, make it.  Its a metric bolt so if you have a SAE bolt thats not threaded all the way and is long enough and right diameter cut the threads off and make your bolt."
114668,Entropy,2007-09-17 15:38:00,747,I would make it but my neighbours 'set' is not a full set.  lol  I'll head to Canadian Tire after work.
114691,dwc67,2007-09-17 16:32:00,140,you may not be able to get it in a hex head bolt but you will be able to get it in a machine screw with a robinson or philips head. skip canadian tire and go to home depot. machine screws are not that strong (gr2) you might want to redrill and tap to 1/4 and use a grade 8 bolt if it's something important
