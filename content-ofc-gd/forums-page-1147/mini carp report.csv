It was dad's turn first and after about 20 minutes I caught this little guy.  We didn't get anything else after that but he said that was okay as we can try again after supper and after school tomorrow.I think I have Tyler hooked on carp fishing now as well.On a side note,when fishing last night we saw another bow caught and today there were a lot of fly fishermen on the river so I am assuming the run is on.Will have to try for trout this week."

114464,fatherof3,2007-09-16 22:48:00,1769,"Gimby,we get bows right up to the dam in town and trout up the Nith. Mo,thanks to a very generous member of this board Tyler will be getting a much better reel so hopefully can get those doubleheader shots for you."
