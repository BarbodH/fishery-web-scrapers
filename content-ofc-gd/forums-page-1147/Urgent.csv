114166,Corey,2007-09-15 18:36:00,355,"Roy, I am not underestimating anything. Notice how what I recommended was already done by Gerr?  Slowpoke... nothing to do with stress, at least not on my part. If you were in Gerritt's situation would you want people suggesting you go on a wild goose chase? or even better buy a product that has nothing to do with the situation you are in?  Gerritt's problem was a pretty serious one. People who don't know what he was dealing with should not be offering advise as to what he should do. That would only be compounding it.  Say what you all want to say, but if you ask a question or need help, you would only want solutions from people who know what they are talking about right? How about I start offering stupid solutions to all the problems you people post? I'm sure you'll all appreciate it.  I can understand saying something to support his situation, but offering ideas or solutions that will not even come close to solving the problem is a waste of everybody's time.  Oh... shouldn't this thread be in the Computer Help section?"
114169,SlowPoke,2007-09-15 18:48:00,2984,"Corey, you're getting jumped on not for WHAT you are saying but for the WAY you said it. To belittle everyone else for thier suggestions doesn't make you helpfull, it just makes you look like an idiot. It would have taken less time to be tactful than it did to berate those involved. -Brian"
114177,ccmtcanada,2007-09-15 19:42:00,7971,"I seem to remember another thread where there were a number of members having trouble getting into OFC.  Every other site worked fine and a few of us were trying to 1) find out if anyone else was having problems and 2) try to figure out why every other site was fine and not this one.  Corey...you posted a bunch of stuff about how it's us people who know ""nothing"" about computers who have bunged up our own systems at home.  You basically insulted every member who had the problem saying that we screwed up our own computers.  As soon as a member looked into it and posted what he found out, you jumped all over him and said it definitely wasn't any of those issues and to once again, look at our own machines and incompetence.  If I remember right, Rogers did say there was a problem and that they'd fix it.  Magically, very soon after, the problem was resolved....when you said it had nothing to do with it.  I didn't take any spyware off, I didn't start from scratch, I didn't do ANYTHING to my computer, yet it was working just fine again....and guess what...so did everyone else having the problem.  Did I hear an apology on that thread?  Did I hear an explanation from you?  No...I didn't.  I was going to let this rest...chalk it up to someone who likes to belittle people just for trying to relate, add a little help...but I couldn't...not when you directly insult other members of this board.  Like slowpoke said...it's how you said it that's the issue.  There no need for this kind of crap.  It reminds me of how little kids settle problems...not adults.  Enough said."
114191,Cory,2007-09-15 21:32:00,170,"Good job Corey, no wonder people have such a low image of us IT people.  Want a job?  We are looking for some new support personal in our company and I’m sure with your attitude you can drive most of our problem clients away within a few minutes.  Questions like Raf posted are not un-necessary.  For somebody unfamiliar with the product it is a quick way to figure out if you can help out or not.  Had the software package used a DB that he was familiar with I’m sure he would have offered further advice.  Lots of accounting packages on the market will allow the use of the backend DB of your choice.  But since Simply accounting is not one of the higher end packages by a long run not a lot of support people will have a lot of history with it.  This also leads into Wolfville’s comments.  He didn’t offer an opinion on how to fix Gerritt’s problem, but something to think about going forward.  You did offer Gerritt some good advice, call the company that created/supports the product.  But I’m sure a smart guy like him thought about that right off the bat and that didn’t work out for him and he asked for some input from others.  Don’t jump on other people just because they aren’t as smart as you think you are.  Remember this thread the next time you have a question about something, it might just come back to bite you in the ass."
