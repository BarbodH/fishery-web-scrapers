114353,Greencoachdog,2007-09-16 12:52:00,8163,"It's hard to get frost at 50 degs., but it's the coolest temps we've had in months... felt good!"
114355,OhioFisherman,2007-09-16 13:09:00,6623,"LOL Glen, 50 means the furnace is on?"
114356,danc,2007-09-16 13:12:00,4677,It was -5C here Friday night (about 23F for you rednecks) and -3C this morning. Fall mornings are great. I was up and out of the house before 7 this morning. Very refreshing!!!
114880,Rattletrap2,2007-09-18 01:47:00,1652,"I can't match DanC, but I've definitely had at least three mornings (including this one!) where I had to scrape the windows on the vehicle to get going. Allso nearly wiped out walking across the back deck the other night... all coverd in frost and ice!"
114885,Greencoachdog,2007-09-18 02:01:00,8163,  Dammit man!!!... that almost gave me a shiver as I was sitting here next to the window without a shirt on!
