114537,danc,2007-09-17 03:00:00,4677,I don't get it.
114563,Spiel,2007-09-17 10:22:00,9065,".....He's a holding the rod handle behind the reel Dan, a definite no-no in my books."
114572,TennesseeGuy,2007-09-17 11:07:00,957,Vladimir joins our stable of topless fishers.  Nips in the sun.
114575,Burtess,2007-09-17 11:21:00,901,"Hey, at least he is not holding it upside down..... that really drives me crazy....  Burt"
114576,OhioFisherman,2007-09-17 11:22:00,6623,"LOL, nice hold? Kind of looks like a young GCD?"
114580,Roy,2007-09-17 11:37:00,13728,"He's trying out his personal hero, the Green Coach Dog look. We need to photoshop a wall in there somewhere....maybe even a Twinkie or two. Oh and a blue cat would look nice."
114585,Greencoachdog,2007-09-17 12:03:00,8163,That boy is so white he could almost be from Thunder Bay!
114630,BITEME,2007-09-17 13:58:00,1969,"he was also holdingthe reel  upside down along with other brain children in his enterouge in some pictures, the rod still has plastic on the handle what a geek nothing worse then leaving the cover on your cork"
114637,Roy,2007-09-17 14:13:00,13728,Russian reelette...what a sport....
114638,ccmtcanada,2007-09-17 14:18:00,7971,I sometimes hold the rod that way too....but only when my index finger cramps up and I have to change positions for a minute or two.  I also sometimes hold the reel upside down....but that's only when I use someone else's setup.  I'm a right hand retrieve and most people reel with their left.
114653,POLLIWOGG,2007-09-17 14:52:00,835,These days you need plastic on your cork for protection.....some of those rod holders can be rough.   Ever see George Bush run a chain saw? Now thats scary.  Someone should tell him you don't have to pull it back and forth.
114720,markiemark70,2007-09-17 17:46:00,158,You hold rod funny....I must crush you!!  I find this picture distrubing on many levels.
114729,MJL,2007-09-17 18:10:00,2427,"Reminds me of this this past Saturday. I wasted 30min of my life watching one of the girls on Shelly and Courtney complain on how she can't use a spinning reel.  As for Putin, if it works for him, who's to care? Some of the pictures in that gallery were actually quite nice.  Anyone up for a steelheading road-trip to the Kamchatka region?"
114766,Guest lundboy,2007-09-17 20:11:00,0,"   Did someone tie you down, glue your eyes open, turn on S&C and take away your remote control?"
114777,mistyjr1,2007-09-17 21:00:00,97," Hows this Roy?? Not the best photoshop, and i dont even know if catfish the size of shark jump...  He's got quite the tattoo those    Corey"
114796,danc,2007-09-17 22:13:00,4677, Oh sure. Now you tell me....
114802,Greencoachdog,2007-09-17 22:23:00,8163, That'll be enough of that young man!!!  
114813,danc,2007-09-17 22:46:00,4677," It's never warm enough to fish topless in Thunder Bay GCD. Well, maybe for a day or two a year."
114814,ecxstriper,2007-09-17 22:51:00,343," Cliff isd one of the few who people who are right handed and fishes left handed, but He does catch some really nice fish that way."
114901,tjsa,2007-09-18 02:54:00,1578," :D  Ummm...........wait, hold it just a gol' dern minute there????????????"
