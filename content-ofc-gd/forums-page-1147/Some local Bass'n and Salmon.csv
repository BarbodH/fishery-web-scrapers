114642,Sherriff,2007-09-17 14:38:00,252,Have been getting out lately at night with a buddy and managed to get into some nice largies.  All caught on Senkos of various colours.  Man it's a blast night fishing and waiting to set the hook when these guys are nibblin on the bait....  Here are a few pics.                Then particiapted in the Lift Bridge Salmon Tourney on Sunday.  Had good numbers but nothing big enough for the $'s.  Still a great time.  Here's one of the salmon.......    A great weekend of fishing...  Sherriff
