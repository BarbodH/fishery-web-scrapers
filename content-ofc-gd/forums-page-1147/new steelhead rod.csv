113970,BrownTown,2007-09-14 21:21:00,103," OK, but take into consideration water clarity, depth, flow and size..A 15 foot rod has its advantages over smaller ones. One for example would be lighter leader line for those crystal clear conditons. Not only will you get more hook ups , you will land more fish because the larger rod allows more control as well as more power to flex ratio.. Try using 3.3lb tippet and landing a large fish with a rod less then 13ft..very hard i must say..  But...If you have the money and enjoy the fishing, why not buy a gift for youself and go expensive..I love my 15ft IMX and my G3 waders..Well worth the money being comfortable and catching lots of fish.."
114116,Douger,2007-09-15 13:39:00,116,"i have the 13' quantum pt and really like it.  i started float fishing with a spinning reel and 11' rod and was successful.  it is nice to have well performing gear, but simply spending more money doesn't necessarily mean you will be a better fisherman. as you gain more experience, you will know more about when you will appreciate forking out a little extra cash for some gear you will love.  a guy i fish with has been using a 10'6"" foot shakespeare and $25 quantum reel.  he's been steelheading for 30 years and always catches fish because he knows fish behaviour and knows his environment.  as for the reel, i wanted to try using a centre pin this year and i just bought a raven vectra sst (second hand from dmasse, on this board).  it's a great reel, but it is light and i will need to add weight to the handle to balance the rod.  i bought the raven b/c it was a good deal, and it was recommended to me by another 30 yr. steelheading veteran that the okuma centre pin (about $165) is a very good reel, especially for beginners.  i was going to get it until i saw the raven for sale.  take care"
114270,Canuck2fan,2007-09-16 00:52:00,1444,"If you can exchange the rod you can maybe save a few bucks for a better reel by going with a new brand of rod I just looked yesterday. It was called streamside I think? It was all black 1M 8 graphite, cork handle with hardened steel guides Awesome 13ft rods and only $109.00. Over the counter exchange if you have a problem you just have to pay a 10.95 charge but you walk out with a brand new rod.....  They have them at The Fishing Store in Stratford and Angler Outfitters in Woodstock. So they should be available other places."
114308,pikeie,2007-09-16 02:04:00,380," i have a question about this since im just starting steelheading. i have a 11'6 raven in ultra light action. i bought 6 lbs main line and 3 lbs maxima tippet, will this not work for me am i under guned"
114404,Burtess,2007-09-16 16:45:00,901," I have used a 11'6"" Shimano Canadian Northern Series noodle for good sized steel in the past. On my float rods I usually use 12lb main line and nothing lower than 6lb fluorocarbon leader.  This allows me to bring the fish in more quickly without totally exhausting them.  In the past I used to go very light with leader when running mono, but with the fluorocarbon it allows you to use a heavier leader without spooking the fish.  Burt"
113772,lazybum,2007-09-14 13:41:00,142,"My first noodle rod was a Shakesphere 10.6 Intrepid for $49.99.  I still use this trusty old rod that has landed many salmon, carp and steelhead over the years.  Earlier this week I was using it to zing out cleos.  Whatever rod you use you need to adapt to how it behaves, to its strengths and weaknesses and the conditions you're in.  With my 10.6 it does take me longer to land a big fish compared to my 13 footer which has more backbone.  I just have to be more patient and not horse the fish in and that is what I mean by adapting to your rod as an example.  And a shorter rod has the advantage when walking through dense brush/shrubs/trees along the rivers. There must be many guys out there who have snapped off the tip in the bushes and car doors rather than on the water.  Don't second guess the decision you've already made. Just go out and enjoy the fishing."
113798,tonyb,2007-09-14 14:42:00,1637,"I'll add a something that wasn't mentioned in regards to rod length, but I feel is important.  I think we all know, fish can be caught with 'All-around' type gear.  However, there are certain applications where a longer rod will improve your odds.  Float fishing in tributaries is an example of an application where a longer rod will help your presentation appear more natural.  Let me explain...  When you are float fishing, you typically cast upstream on about a 45 degree angle, and then drift downstream a good distance.  The key to catching fish in moving water (when float/drift fishing), is to present your bait as naturally as possible, to make it look like it is just a tasty morsel of food tumbling along bottom with the same speed of the current at depth.  When you use a shorter rod, you are not able to keep the line up off the water between the top of your float and the tip of your rod.  As a result, there is DRAG caused by the surface of the water between you and your float (usually slack water or an eddy where the current is moving upstream) and your bait will appear to move slower or faster through the water in an un-natural manner.  With a longer rod, you are able to keep your tip high, and more of your line off the surface of the water, greatly reducing that drag and in turn presenting your bait more naturally.  With that being said, bottom-bouncing, casting spinners or other artificials, or ledger fishing do NOT require long rods as you do not need to be concerned with the drag imposed on your float by the surface of the water.  Sheesh, I'm giving away all my secrets  I think you'll be fine with that rod as a start, but you may decide to go with something a bit longer when you get more experienced.  (Or shorter! as the case with some other avid trib fisherman like Spiel, it really comes down to how comfortable you are and what works for you personally)  Tony"
113804,ccmtcanada,2007-09-14 14:55:00,7971," You hit it right there Tony.  This past spring, when I first started float fishing in the tribs, I needed all the help I could get.  A longer rod helped me in drift quality/length and its a little more forgiving if there's a little slack in the line for a hookset.  Once I get more comfortable fishing the tribs, and refine my technique, I may very well opt for a shorter rod, but I still have lots to learn.  As for fighting the fish, I didn't notice a lot of difference, but my mentality is, if you cant hook the fish, there's not much of a fight...LOL."
113829,Nater,2007-09-14 15:32:00,68,Gerrist I dunno if you can truly say that about a 15' rod and higher catch ratio...I was there that day on the beaver and I remeber doing soem serious damage on the bows with a 15' rod...Way more line control then most guys which means that you keep a straight line between you and the float and you dont ahve an extra 15' of lien out when you go to set the hook  I would hardly say that your tryign to be in a fashion show spending good money for quality gear that isnt made in a sweatshop over in asia  nothign wrong with runnign good equipment...you guys say the same thing about people who bass fish and have 12 different combos on the boat and a garbage bag full of baits?  Nate
113895,tonyb,2007-09-14 18:22:00,1637," It's just not for everyone Nate.  10% of fisherman catch 90% of fish, I truly believe that, and I also believe it applies to gear.  10% of anglers will demand only the best, regardless of cost, the rest won't care so much, as long as they can get a combo for under $60.  Tony"
113917,solopaddler,2007-09-14 19:50:00,8605,"Hey Rene, glad to see you picked up a rod! For a rod solely dedicated to using with a centrepin, I'd recommend a 13'er though..."
113920,douG,2007-09-14 19:54:00,2693,"I've got the same rod, the Quantum.  I've yet to use it for it's intended purpose tho.  I'm sure it will be fine."
113921,silvio,2007-09-14 19:59:00,433,First off for the guys who say that we use longer rods and expensive reels and all that bling bling for fashion and show is not true maybe some show off there gear but not all. I said to get a longer rod because its is hard to drift a float with a 6 foot rod or 9 foot and at time even a 13 foot rod when your using a pin. The main purpose it to get a natural drift and on bigger rivers you can get drifts that are 80-100 ft long with a 9 foot rod you will have a hard time controlling the float past 10 ft in the drift honestly. maybe these guys telling you its bling and stuff fish spinners or bottom bounce thatâ€™s why they have the ability to use smaller rods or maybe they can really fish a rod that short but your starting off and when float fishing longer rods are need period. Now weather you spend 100 or 1000 on a 13 foot does not mean your going to get more fish. So for theses guys who said its all for fashion I told him to get a longer rod not a more expensive one.
113928,ChrisK,2007-09-14 20:13:00,2772,"I've been using a 13ft Wild River St Croix for 20 years now. Its a pretty much do all pole for small or larger rivers.As well as keeping the line off the water on a drift the longer poles also offer up the option of running lighter tippets which in some cases will make or break your day.On the 13ft. I  can run as light as a 3lb tippet and catch fish over ten pounds with little trouble. I personally won't go any lighter with tippets on the 13ft.,no sence really especially with the flouracarbon these days .Now if you had a 15ft pole you could run lighter than 3lb. tippets if you liked because of the soft action of these long poles. Anyhow,just my two cents worth...Good Luck !!"
