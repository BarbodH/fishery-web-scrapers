I see  rain heading that way and am thinking I should scoot down for a while.  I have been down a few times late at night and seen fish being caught ,but just a few. Any suggestions on best times .   Thanks for any help Brian"
113989,mistaredone,2007-09-14 22:34:00,913,"The fish should be moving up stream with the rain.  Best times at Bronte have been late night early morning.  Sorry to hijack your thread but to save posting a very similar thread, how much longer can you catch salmon from the pier??"
113997,BGis,2007-09-14 22:51:00,15,"((how much longer can you catch salmon from the pier??))   No problem, I,d like to know that myself.  The reason I asked about the rain was that my fatherinlaw was telling me that any lightning or thunder will put the fish back down deep. Myself and a few friends are going to give it a try, guess it,ll be a learning lesson at worst.  Thanks  BTW   the few I seen being caught were so big it had my mouth watering so bad I was damn near drooling. Think I,ll bring a bib along just in case ."

114034,mikeymikey,2007-09-15 01:23:00,376,So salmons will swim up as it is raining? right?  or was it after a good rain?
114055,xrap,2007-09-15 03:11:00,683,They will make their run up the rivers and streams when the water is high.
114182,Riparian,2007-09-15 20:44:00,269,"The runoff from the rain enters the headwaters of tributaries all over the province, which in turn raises water levels as well as changes temperature and water clarity.  This in turn causes fresh ""runs"" of fish."
114223,BGis,2007-09-15 23:47:00,15,"I ended up going from 11--2:00 last night and there was quite a few runs. A friend that went with me hooked 2 and landed 1 about 15 or more lbs.There was a lot of people out and 20+ fish caught in the 3 hrs I was there.  Think I,ll go again tonightl and see if I can hook 1 . What a scrap Bob had last night and I cant wait for a chance.  Thanks for the info  mistaredone and finshindevil"
