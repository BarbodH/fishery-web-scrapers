113252,Big Swede,2007-09-13 03:42:00,23,"After a fruitless (and fishless) trip to a windy and choppy Stoney Lake, I had a lot of time to think about all things muskie. With cookslav and I working hard at striving towards that legendary magic number of casts required to catch a muskie, I had to wonder about whether we are going about it the wrong way.  I mean, if 10,000 casts is the magic number needed to catch a muskie , then how do you count casts when you primarily troll for them? Does it just count for one or is there a number you multiply by? Say, by mile trolled or something like that. If it's just one, well then that's just plain crap and might just explain our lack of success.  And what if you are fishing in muskie waters but targeting another species like walleye? Can you count those casts too? Jeez, I hope so!  "
113286,lew,2007-09-13 08:24:00,12767,"Just look at those 10,000 casts as practice swings on the golf course Big Swede, and every once in awhile you'll whack a hole-in-one  Sorry to hear bout the skunk, but your number is coming up and then it'll all be worth it."
113301,mcallister.grant,2007-09-13 10:28:00,327,Keep casting man!!! The only way you'll get one is if your line is in the water. I have only ever caught musky by accident.
113302,OhioFisherman,2007-09-13 10:30:00,6623,"LOL, it doesn`t take that many casts to hook up with one if your bass fishing! You just don`t want to stick a hook in 10,000 before you land one. LOL and don`t lip them!"
113303,Marc Thorpe,2007-09-13 10:30:00,621,"Well man,theres 5280 feet per mile with an average cast of 125 feet multiplied by 10 000 cast and divided by 5280 feet per mile You""ll have to troll 236.74 miles with an average of 3 miles per gallon,that will cost you 80$ in fuel  So ya wanna catch a muskie eh  Look on the bright side,its better than trolling the couch"
113308,Dondorfish,2007-09-13 10:48:00,1000,Hey Marc - Where are you getting gas for a buck a gallon?  LOL  Don
113326,TJQ,2007-09-13 12:17:00,7806,Umm... i tried to tell you this Marc...  but you wouldn't listen  Seeing that I am now the official Muskie expert here.....  .....   casting is for losers....  oh ya and where did you learn to divide.....  I thought muskie fishermen couldn't get past grade 5.    (watch it start now!!    )

113427,Guest gbfisher,2007-09-13 17:26:00,0,"Its a ""FIRST FISH"" thing. Once you get One....the others will follow more frequently...Now if I could only follow my own rule!"
113504,addict,2007-09-13 21:11:00,475,fish for bass with a spinner youll get your lunge.
113514,Handlebarz,2007-09-13 21:34:00,3790,I think thyesay fer troling its a fish for every 100 hours and I am not doing the mathon that I know that this year I had just over 50 hours in casting and troling before I bagged my first of the season and she was well worth it.
113518,2 tone z71,2007-09-13 21:41:00,1311,"I trolled average 3 hrs a night for 2.5 weeks before I got my first ski,tonight may be the 5 th night without seeing another im hopeing not thou"
113540,Pike_Nut71,2007-09-13 22:46:00,18,"Big Swede, fish are weird creatures. Picture this. My Dad and I were sitting in a 14 foot alumiminum, I am at the front, him at the back, so let's say we were no more then 12 feet apart, and at anchor. I was catching perch and pike like there was no tomorrow. Him, well lets just say he practiced his swearing a lot between fish number one and his last fish of the night (number two). I have no explanation for this.  But sitting on your butt wishing for a big skie won't get er done. So keep beating the water and enjoy the outdoors, it does the mind and body good. Even a blind dog will eventually find a bone.....  "
113608,Big Swede,2007-09-14 01:33:00,23,"  I'm loving the words of encouragement and the debate on the ratio of trolling miles to casts! That was a grumpy comment I made in jest to cookslav after 6 hours of battling steady winds that were supposed to die down at noon.  Thanks for the support guys but rest assured, like most of you here on this board I am sure, I can spend 16 hours in a boat with no food, no bio breaks and no fish, and I will still hit the water with fishing rod in hand the very next day. It's the silence and discovering new water in the great outdoors that keeps me going. IMO, the thrill of a fish pulling back at the end of your line is just the cherry on the sundae.  Keep those lines tight, my friends!"
113623,Garry2Rs,2007-09-14 02:21:00,1425,"In my opinion, Stony/Stoney is the toughest lake in the east Kawarthas.  I would choose Lower Buckhorn over anything else .  Send me an e-mail and I will give you my personal game plan for a day of Musky fishing. Garry2r's"
113639,kemper,2007-09-14 03:05:00,2232," And here I was about to say that Stoney must be a great lake for musky, because I landed two Skis there this season while bass fishing, and NONE on buckhorn while FISHING FOR THEM.  go figure.  In order to catch musky, fish for bass?"
113686,Marc Thorpe,2007-09-14 10:24:00,621,  I got Schooled alright Hey so I went a little lean on the cost of gas Ya dont want me to frighten the poor lad  Grade 5!!!! I thought it all ended in grade 3
113688,lookinforwalleye,2007-09-14 10:51:00,4399,Just go to Scugog if it takes you longer than a hour to get your first slimmy then your doing something wrong.
114102,Cookslav,2007-09-15 12:27:00,1457,LOL swede!  Bad weather was all that stood between them and us on Wednesday....it happens (Litterally couldn't work a spot with out getting blown off it in seconds.) Next time My friend the weather Gods have to be with us atleast once this year LOL!
114111,Rich,2007-09-15 13:04:00,3927,"Go to the kawarthas and cast a spinnerbait. Any size, any color. Eventually you'll get one!"
114141,dow33,2007-09-15 16:39:00,27,Well i hear ya!Iam on stoney lk now for 12yrs and this is my worst year yet .Not only for skies but all fish.I think they all took a hike to the locks and are on there way to sunny florida.
114447,Kerry,2007-09-16 21:26:00,383,"Oh I Had to answer to this one Big Swede cause I feel your PAIN!!

Kerry"
114449,joefish,2007-09-16 21:34:00,165,"Dont worry Big Swede, they will come!  I didnt cast 10,000 but it came to me and it will come to you as well.  Hasnt come to me since but I can wait... No rush here!"
