830277,iFish4real,2014-01-13 22:16:00,386,get a smart phone with a map or even better with Navionics did u catch anything ?
830284,Locnar,2014-01-13 22:36:00,645,Head out near the shanty town... you'll probably catch plenty of perch.

830357,sneak_e_pete,2014-01-14 02:38:00,540,Thanks for the replies..how far a walk do you think it is?  A kilometre?
830360,SBCregal,2014-01-14 02:48:00,688,you'll probably walk further from your parking spot to shore than from shore to the perch grounds.  a 10-15 min walk from shore should get you pretty close.  Ryan
