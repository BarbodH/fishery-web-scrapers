830642,Big Cliff,2014-01-15 11:42:00,6899,"That was cute!  When my grandaughter was about three she caught a little speck about the size of a hotdog. It fell off her hook and onto the grass so she picked it up to take over to show her mom. Our dog Andy came over to see what was going on so Tara held it out in her hands so Andy could see it and ""SLURP"" it was gone, he just inhaled it. Boy was she ever mad at him LOL."

830659,Acountdeleted,2014-01-15 14:21:00,2562,"A friend of mine, when she was younger was in a rubber dingy and hooked into something big. She ended up bringing in a nice big pike but couldn't get it unhooked. It was thrashing around so much it scared her. So she kept the fish in the boat and swam back to shore."
830660,DanD,2014-01-15 14:37:00,2223,"Reminds me of my son and the first picture I wanted to take of him holding his catch. He lands the pike, I unhook it and tell Andy to put his rod down; he's so excited that he put the rod down alright, right down over the side of the boat. LOL Wish I could find the picture; there's tears in his eyes and a smile on his face; talk about mixed feelings? LOL  Dan."
