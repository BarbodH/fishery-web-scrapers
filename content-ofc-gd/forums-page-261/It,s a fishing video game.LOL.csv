830024,Handlebarz,2014-01-12 15:42:00,3790,"Gotta love playing with them fishies my wife hates when I do that at the black of the boat if we are anchored. The best part I found was that all the pickerel here in our river are not on bottom in the winter. Years ago when I first started to use my unit on the ice I was rewarded right away by it showing me fish 6-8' off the bottom in 16 FOW I brought up my line and bam right away I had a 28""  Thanks for posting Brian I have not been out ice fishing in years so its nice to watch someone else have fun"
