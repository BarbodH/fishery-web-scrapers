I have been torn like others here on celebs from the board, fishing world hockey music NASCAR and more. Like Brian just posted my father is my first choice but its for celebs not our idols or people we look up to that makes my choice so hard.  I guess I would have to say Pat McAfee he is the punter from the Indianapolis colts he is on the bob and Tom show and is funny has snot. He has such a willingness for life and a huge child like eagerness to explore every adventure he can that I think taking him out musky fishing would be crazy with excitement.  I have been lucky enough to share my boat and other boats with so many in the OFC family it has been a great time out there with them."

All individuals of considerable intellect and insight. Pretty hard to find better intellectual company. Very much the opposite of some of my classmates now sitting in Parliament. They're not worth wasting lead or ink to acknowledge them. I'm not so much of an idealist any more, and there are few in this world that impress me any longer.
