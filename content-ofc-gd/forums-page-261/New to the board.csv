I understand the Smallie obsession, Musky? Was at a tackle store in London today and was gawking at some of those Musky baits. You guys must have some pretty large for arms pitching those bulldog things with a 2X2 rod. Wow. I'm impressed."

830180,SuperDave,2014-01-13 14:32:00,204,"Well hi Dave you did say the magic words ""smallmouth fanatic"" welcome aboard grab a coffee and jump right in !!!! Where abouts are you ? And where do you mostly fish !!!! Cheers I live in Stoney Creek. My smallie fishing has taken place on the upper and lower Niagara as well as Lake Erie. I fish both Canadian and U.S. waters. While muskie has been my fish of choice for 18 years, the smallmouth fishery that exists in the Niagara region is fantastic!! Favorite way to catch both species is on top. Cheers"
