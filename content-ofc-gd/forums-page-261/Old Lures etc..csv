Any idea of the age of these items. I suspect 1950's to 1960's, there are a few other lures that are similar but not in as good shape. Anyone recently fished an older lure? How would you fish these things?  thanks skdds"

The reel I think would be at least late 60's even newer perhaps. Most of the early spinning stuff didn't have bearings."
