829835,Rich,2014-01-10 22:55:00,3927,Looking to book a trip with a buddy Jan 18th and rent a hut for Simcoe Lakers (hopefully). Haven't done it for 20 years and last time as a 7 yr old I was skunked. Lol  Any advice on where to go/who to pick?

Otherwise, maybe try Bear Point Fish Hut Rentals, Love to Fish Simcoe,  Dave's Fish Huts or Lucky Sons.  There are probably more, but I haven't used one in a long time."
