830293,Slayingm,2014-01-13 23:03:00,204,Had a couple of groups out over the weekend and what a mixed bag we caught. The one day we got into a mixed bag of big Haliburton Whitefish and Walleye. On the other day I took clients out on a different lake and we got into some nice eating sized Lake trout and Whitefish.  In both cases the Whitefish preferred small minnows on set lines worked right on the bottom while the Lakers were more aggressive and we caught them on small jigging spoons tipped with a half minnow and worked 5 to 15ft off the bottom. The Walleye also hit the minnow tipped jigs worked slowly on the bottom and wanted the jig bounced off the bottom with some pauses just inches off the bottom.        Remember to be safe out there and Good Fish'n.... Greg.
