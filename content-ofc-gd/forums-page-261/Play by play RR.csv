Nothing noteworthy at all on the fish side of things  missed alot of bites, drilled what had to be 300 holes in all, just wasnt our day. On the plus side, met some new friends, had GREAT weather, kiddos had a blast snowboarding near the river and we had a beauty sun out there:) terry, your setting were bang on!!!! Thanks dood, those minor changes made a hyyyuge difference! Lots of fishing for me coming up, so im just gonna do reports in this thread as apposed to starting new ones. Have a few nights on the ice this week then LOTW next weekend!!!!! Stay thiraty my friends;)"
