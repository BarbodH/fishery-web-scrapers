Greater chance to get an infection in hospital than at home.  The Babe too.  She would have had that complication whether she stayed or was discharged.  Pain needs to be well managed.  They are caught though, meds pass thru  to the Babe.  Less is better.  I remember when we went into the delivery ward for our first delivery.  A woman was screaming in labour.  The nurse told us with a smirk.  ""She's Italian.....they are very vocal, you'll be fine""  and we were"
829369,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-08 23:12:00,8243,"Definitely bigbuck... if you have an employee hurt (or needing a knee replacement ) the employer can pay for it on their behalf. How do you think all these hockey players get repaired the next day.. and sometimes the same night?  My company sent me to Buffalo for an MRI 2 days after I tore my good knee up then made arrangements for the surgery the next Saturday to get me back on the job asap. Was looking at a year through OHIP plus recovery. Then they hired a private therapist and received daily sessions at the plant hospital. I asked for more money if they thought I was that valuable, they gave me my own parking space."
829379,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-08 23:46:00,8243,"The health care system in Hamilton has served my wife and myself well. I couldn't complain until just recently.  I had a cystoscopy to remove a bladder tumor in November of 2011. Part of the follow up is a cystoscopy every 6 months for 2 years then annually for life. A cystoscopy is when the surgeon takes a 1/2 inch piece of ABS pipe and cuts the end off with a hack saw and doesn't smooth out the burr. Then he jams it down inside your penis and moves it around for 5 minutes. This is done while your wide awake. Oh yea, there's a topical ointment applied to numb the pain. There is no numbing that pain I can tell you. After I was  able to get off the table the first time I said "" the next time you do this I will be put under, they put you under for a colonoscopy and I've had one without a General and that doesn't hurt at all "". He told me that when they set up the new Urology Clinic at St. Joseph's in Hamilton they didn't budget for an anesthesiologist. So for 2 years I counted the days until the next torture session because hey, a Doctor would never lie to you. This past December I received a letter from the McMaster Urology Clinic at St. Joseph's Hospital saying Dr. Paul Whalen would no longer be associated with the clinic. I was told by my family Dr's office to find myself a urologist that provides a General, another too long story. I was willing to drive to Ottawa. I found a Urologist that does provides General for this exact procedure. He is part of the group of Urologists at McMaster University Urology Clinic at St. Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton Ontario Canada. If Paul Whalen want's to sue me I say go ahead, I dare you to, make my day. In fact I haven't been to Victoria for years, maybe I should sue for pain and suffering plus emotional distress, which all of which is absolutly true.  All I would need to do to be awarded damages is have the Judge undergo the procedure himself, it would be my luck to get a woman judge."

As Wayne stated, OHIP for the most part serves us we'll. But 'exceptions/exclusions' can be life altering for patients & financially crippling for some families.

Sometimes people also just make mistakes.  Your friend's experience is pretty rare - I don't know ANYONE with a C section who was sent home (or even allowed to leave) after just one day.

When they discharged my father from emergency after a stroke (TIF mini stroke ) I wrote out a note saying I didn't agree and held that emergency not yet 25 year old Dr. responsible, she wouldn't sign it, I had it witnessed by another patients family member. I bet that kid Dr. didn't sleep much. He was back the next day with a second stroke. Then they admitted him. Same Dr. sent him upstairs asap. I guess it's called gaining experience, but it's at the risk of a life in medicine."

A person who essentially knows who to go to when you have a problem that hospital staff do not want to address  Thanks, now that's information that I never knew.

829158,okumasheffield,2014-01-08 00:06:00,318,"Here is more background information ...  Wife of my buddy gave birth this past Saturday and was discharged 1 day after with tremendous amount of pain. He argued with the doctor to let his wife stay in the hospital longer (willing to pay for additional costs, of course) until her condition got better.  Needless to say, she was discharged just like others regardless of individual's ability to recover.  1 day later, his wife was rushed to ER and was determined to have a complication caused by infections. Obviously, no men would want to see their wives suffering, especially because of a health system providing bare minimum amount of support when compared to other countries'.  the health system of the country they come from provides minimum 7 days stay in hospital to women who give births to ensure there will be no health issues prior to discharge instead of the 'crap', they went through.  Hence, he is looking for private hospitals providing such services he wants instead of being told it is what he/she is ALLOWED to have.   As far as I am concerned, I CANNOT imagine to be discharged from the hospital 24 hrs after getting C-sectioned."

829176,Pikeslayer,2014-01-08 00:50:00,1443,"Agreed. There is definitely a 2nd & more efficient 'tier' of healthcare in most provinces. These are typically labelled 'institutes' or 'clinics' and are fully accredited to the same standard as hospitals. The 'dirty little secret' our provincial health care ministries don't want us to know, is that these institutes/clinics operate @ significantly lower costs with a higher level of patient care, therapy & significantly better recovery/outcomes. Unfortunately, currently these are only available/affordable to the wealthy or insurance/worker compensation claims. It boggles my mind as to why our provincial health care plans refuse to embrace, fund, refer & reimburse these institutes/clinics where specialty care is required. Taxpayer savings would be exponential."
829178,okumasheffield,2014-01-08 00:53:00,318,"He was concerned (I would as well) that stitched wound would pop OPEN and was told that it is impossible because all stitched up.  To make the matter even worse, his wife was SCREAMING & was BEGGING him to stop driving because of pain caused by road vibrations. They turned around and went back to the hospital and the reply was ""PAIN CONTROL is part of the recovery, Take painkillers if necessary""  Well, he went ballistic and started yelling ""WTH would you not allow my wife to stay until there is much less pain?"" ""WTH would you not give my wife painkillers before discharging her from the hospital?""  You can imagine how pissed off he was when rushing to ER the day after. ""This is EXACTLY why my wife should have stayed in the hospital for couple more days so that you incompetent ""axxhole"" can at least fix up mistakes without making my wife suffer""  it got to the point I was called by the hospital security to bail him out.  Unbelievable. I would not believe it if I were not involved in it."

However, MOH has chosen the other path. Sad."
829198,bigbuck,2014-01-08 01:37:00,2449,"Have your buddy rush his wife to another hospital. Preferably a larger one. My wife had 2 caesareans and was in for 3 nights if my memory serves me correctly. They CANNOT discharge her if she refuses and does not think she is well enough. Come to think of it, she was in for 5 nights for the second child because we has Norwalk ripping through the house which put her into early labour. Tell him to be firm but not get irate, that does not help his wife. Screaming in pain after a c section is not normal. I wish him all the luck. Our health care system is not perfect but it is what we have to work with. For my cancer treatment, I cannot give enough praise to my doctor and the nursing staff at Credit Valley's chemo ward."

829223,bigugli,2014-01-08 02:51:00,6138,"Although medical science is advancing considerably, patient care has declined. As to the c=section: 30 years back a primip (first birth) C-section had a standard 3 day hospitalization. Non complicated vaginal births could be discharged after 24 hours. These norms have all changed  It is not only the ministry that sets these standards. Each hospital sets its standards of care depending on the schools of thought prevalent within the OB/Gyn department. Advocates for natural birthing, aggressive intervention, on demand inducement and C-sections, traditional midwifery, research medicine, all having differing methodologies and agendas, all wanting the ""best interest"" of the patient.  In the current medical climate it is important to be familiar with the MD you choose, and just as important to make yourself familiar, and comfortable, with the hospital at which your physician practices. When doctors and hospital staff are on differing pages, the patient, all too often, is caught in the middle, and suffers accordingly. Politics in hospitals are just as dirty as the politics found on parliament hill. I am so glad to have gotten away from it some 20 years ago."
