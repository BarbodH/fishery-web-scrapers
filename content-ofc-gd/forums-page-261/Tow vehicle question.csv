828908,grimsbylander,2014-01-07 00:51:00,3016,Lots of talk about what will pull the boat but that's only part of it. You have to stop it too and do it in an emergency on wet pavement. You also want highway speed stability. I had a V8 explorer and now have a V8 Silverado for pulling a 20' Ranger. The biggest difference is how the boat can't 'push' my Silverado around. Does the trailer have brakes? Single or tandem axle?
828920,Gerry,2014-01-07 02:21:00,257,"A Ranger R80 with a 150 Opti isn't too heavy so any full size pickup with a V6 will handle it adequately.  Before buying my 2012 F150 5.0L, I test drove the Ecoboost and I was impressed with the power. The boosters don't make it more efficient, in fact the opposite is true, but the power they provide to a small block is awesome. The torque felt the same as the V8. I didn't buy it only because they wanted $2K more for what I felt was no advantage over the V8.....same gas mileage.....from what I hear from friends who have them."

828932,Sharkbait22,2014-01-07 04:08:00,297,To a very large degree its the mass of the vehicle that determines the fuel consumption.  It's physics.  In most cases the bigger engine makes sense particularly on longer hilly drives and passing transports etc.  Driving habits being equal a large engine will add some weight but it's small e.g. 1 mpg.  Most truck these days are big.  Even the Toyota Taco is big.  Where did the small trucks go!  Saving on weight (fuel) is more easily done by getting out of a truck based SUV but then many of those can't tow more than 1500-2000 lbs safely.  Got a big boat or a large family then you'll likely need a big vehicle. If driving short a distance to a decent ramp than you could get away with a smaller vehicle. 99% of the time you'll be towing nothing.
828936,WeedLine,2014-01-07 04:28:00,322,The truck I have now is a 2001 GMC Sonoma. She is a work horse. I've killed this truck and towed a 16ft aluminum Sylvan every week for 5 yrs. She will pull the Ranger but I could feel her pulling uphill and the boat is hard on the truck's brakes. It has a V6 Vortec 4.3L engine. It works everyday doing demos and renos and is driven primarily in the GTA. I'm sad to get rid of her but it's time to upgrade.. Thanks for all the input guys!

I don't know about you folks but I know guys that will stop twice for a $2.00 coffee in that time, or smoke that much or more in cigarettes in an hours drive.  V8 over a V6 in my opinion for all the pro reasons stated above. I really like Grimsbylanders point, beyond the pulling power, stopping power and safety to me is more important than saving a few pennies on fuel. Penny wise pound foolish."
828957,mike rousseau,2014-01-07 13:04:00,4661,It's funny.... When anyone asks about getting a 90hp outboard or a 125hp almost everyone on this site will say go with the extra power.... Not much talk about gas  When it's a car/truck it's a different story... Lol
828965,kickingfrog,2014-01-07 13:57:00,8333,"In many cases an argument can be made for a turbo for fuel economy. Yes, some have had durability issues, but the same can be said for cars/trunks in general. If you don't jump on the gas after every red light the engine is fuel efficient, but does have the power to get up and go if you want to pass or what not.  The idea for a tow vehicle with a turbo makes a lot of sense in theory, admittedly some applications have had problems. You have a ""fuel efficient"" vehicle for day to day use but the power to tow as well. If you mostly use a vehicle for towing then having a bigger engine is likely better then the smaller engine with a turbo but every situation is different."
828976,BillM,2014-01-07 14:33:00,17367,"The only time a turbo should be mentioned when talking about trucks is when the word 'diesel' is behind it       You watch how the new Ram with the 3.0 turbo diesel makes out, if VM Motori can actually keep the engine together, it will easily have the best mileage out of any of the fullsized trucks."

If your towing and driving a truck, your going to burn gas. Period.  S. Both statements are old information and do not apply to today's turbos. Using a turbo allows the computer to adjust to a wider range of driving conditions than a non turbo engine. With a v6 turbo charged driven economically it will save you money in the long run. Ford lied, imagine that a car company exaggeration their fuel economy numbers. bad on them but look at how much metal they are moving down the road. Turbos sized correctly are bullet proof eliminating the main death of a turbo issue the bearing that support the shaft. The new generation turbos use ceramic nozzles that under pressure suspend the shaft in a field of oil elimination the wear associated with the older turbos. They also are now in some vehicles (Ford) are using twin sequential turbos that spool up at different rates one for low end torque and as the 2nd one builds in to supply midrange. If you spool up a turbo to 28 lbs you are at two atmosphere basically you need to add twice the fuel to keep the ratio balanced but it turns 3.7 into 7.4 liter motor. The trick is the computer optimists the ratio so you burn the least amount of fuel possible to keep 7.4 motor running clean and safely. Don't fear the turbo it is  reliable and when driven correctly a money saver in the long run.   Art"

829052,aplumma,2014-01-07 18:35:00,6896,Nope the power strokes are not the shining star of turbo technology. The units were sequenced incorrectly and the results stressed them out and they blew. I think the flaw is in their design of the motor than the turbo components used.   Art

829777,MrSimon,2014-01-10 18:56:00,217,"To the original question ....  If its your daily driver first, and a tow vehicle second, you need to think primarily about what you'll be using the vehicle for on a daily basis.  Do you need to carry a lot of people ... haul stuff ... drive long distances ... impress customers .... etc etc etc?  Once you answer those questions, then you can start looking at vehicles that can also handle some weekend towing.  You also need to think about what kind of towing you'll be doing.  Long distance?   High speed?  Hills and mountains?  Heavy traffic?  Depending on all those things, you could be looking at everything from a mini-van to a diesel powered truck.  I've owned and towed with a lot of different vehicles .... the one thing I found is that small to medium sized vehicles with mid sized V6s might be rated for up to 3,500 or even 5,000 pounds .... but they don't handle it very well.  A V6 might have enough power, but the vehicle doesn't have the wheelbase, suspension, braking, transmission, or gearing to handle the load well.  You can never go wrong with a Chevy/GMC 1500 with the 5.3L V8 ... you can get the pick-up or suburban depending on needs."

The MDS in a Hemi switches from 8 cylinders to 4 cylinders and never operates on 6 cylinders and will engage during city driving once you learn how to accelerate slowly at a steady rate from a stop.

It's extremely easy to rig up an LED which will let you know when the MDS is on or not and is a very valuable tool for teaching you how to drive to get the best MPG and also teaches you how cross winds, wind from other vehicles, and drafting makes the motor work harder/less.

The v8 just doesnt have to work as hard.  Definately do your research and consider what type of driving you do other than towing (city vs hwy)  On the flipside, those new V6 Rams have plenty of power and get good fuel economy but they are out of your budget.

828862,Bill Shearer,2014-01-06 21:21:00,456,"The question asked was what would be the best to tow the Ranger, and be within his budget, between a V6 and a V8. No question in my mind that based on his budget the vehicles he should be looking at will need a V8. I have owned 15 F150s over the years. Most have had V8s. 3 have had V6s. All have been adequate, but the best one I have owned out of all of them is the 2012 V6 with the Ecoboost. The naysayers are welcome to their opinions. I am going to get another next year and it will have Ecoboost engine as well. The raw power available when desired is worth it to me. Acceleration is awesome! My fuel efficiency is 11.6L/100 km, in the warm weather, on cruise at 110km/hr, and 12.6L/100km at 110km/hr in the winter. Worse if I go 120km/hr. It isn't a VW Golf! It weighs over 5500 lbs with driver,tools, and box cover. If you are a right lane 100km/hr driver, and don't pass many vehicles your results will be much better. Gas and vehicles are expensive, and the price is only going up. If you are caught in the grind, and have to travel more than 100km to work each way/day, you really should look at alternatives. If it is a great tow vehicle you want, then you can't go wrong with the V8 full size pick-up, at least in my opinion. And if your budget allows, the F150 with ecoboost is the cats azz."
