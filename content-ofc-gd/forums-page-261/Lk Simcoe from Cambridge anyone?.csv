829264,NAC,2014-01-08 13:36:00,369,Thinking of trying early next week.

Weekends are difficult for me unless I can get the other half out too.  With this weekends weather being warmer, she would likely go too."
829349,NAW,2014-01-08 22:15:00,4022,On a total side note...  I spend about an hour sitting in traffic on the 401 near Cambridge yesterday on a sheet of wickedly bad black ice....

829440,landry,2014-01-09 03:39:00,1005,"I drove my kid to a hockey game yesterday. The 501 was the worst I have ever seen it. Crazy.  I hit simcoe often and have a few buds I usually go with. Feel free to pm me if u r thinking of going. We perch a lot in vb area and I do fish for trout a but, but apparently not very well:)"

829479,NAC,2014-01-09 13:52:00,369,I think the impending rain is gonna mess up all plans to ice fish anywhere for a while.  Will post again after things freeze up again.  Thanks for the replies. Can't wait to see what the rivers do with all the ice and now huge rain forecast.  Might be better to think about steelheading next week

It won't be run off, it will be all out flooding and major issues for ice on the lower end of all rivers.  Obviously I would go after that, and yes it would be a very good choice."

Obviously I would go after that, and yes it would be a very good choice. That's what I meant,There's far to much ice snow and ground frost for any field or bank run off . good luck!!"
830340,NAC,2014-01-14 01:28:00,369,Ended up on Simcoe this morning.  Only one laker that never left the wet side of the hole. Willing to give it another go sometime if anyone from my area wants to make the trip?
