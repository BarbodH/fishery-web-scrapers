I will admit, you install a pv system and for the 1st - 3rd year ish depending on your energy consumption you may not make as much $$ as you want. But modern day technology can calculate very accurately the solar isolation of any given day in your specific location. Mind you, without the proper knowledge and data required to make accurate calculations one may very much under calculate their potential savings/earning/sunlight  Big Cliff... no i wish im in Toronto, havent had time to set up my bio on here yet.

829389,beagle dad,2014-01-09 00:15:00,224,i have worked with solar company on and off for a few yrs it is my understanding you can not sell to grid and power house ... you set up for 1 or other....solar set up is approx. 8-10 times more than generator  not an expert solar contracts selling to grid was worth it few yrs back   the contract prices dropped   the solar installation business slowed  just my opinion...wish it was cheaper...i'd be all over it
829391,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-09 00:17:00,8243,"NightCrawler,  You say people wouldn't invest unless there was a return to be had. As someone once said "" there's a sucker born everyday"". The local paper reported last fall there was a nice rural couple that bought a solar system for $60000.00 from a door to door salesman in Dunnville. After the system was built they told Haldimand Hydro they were ready to send the power into the grid. Haldimand Hydro said thanks but no thanks. The infrastructure was a maximum capacity. Do your homework folks, this working family has to wait until they build a new sub station before they start to see any ROI and are paying interest on a loan. There are no plans for Haldimand Hydro to build any more capacity for there system in Dunnville, they don't need anymore electricity."
829393,beagle dad,2014-01-09 00:26:00,224,not surprised at this......and the issue is they cant even give it away...soo many laws....energy act... stick with a huge  bill for quite a few yrs even if they hook up their own house to the panels and for 60000  the system i way more than they need for a house
829402,NightCrawler,2014-01-09 00:54:00,15,"I never understood why people make such big and serious decisions without seeking further professional help ( not just going by what the person selling the service/product says ) but i guess that is where the quote is inserted   "" there's a sucker born everyday""  As for having a solar grid tied system AND powering your house with electricity you produced by your panels - well lets just say you cant and can do that. It is possible and the technology is there, but due to strict government energy policies and local distribution utility companies it just isnt possible for the everyday homeowner ( hydro companies have to make money somehow ) to have that as an option. * this confirmed as of now by my prof. May have missed the 'not available for homeowners so utility companies keep making money' part in my lecture LOL *Goodluck!"
829419,Steve,2014-01-09 01:54:00,2075,"NightCrawler, that actually ""is"" possible. 100%.  However, contractually, it is only possible if you have your own microFIT contract with the OPA, and your not leasing your roof/land to a 3rd party.  If your leasing your rooftop or ground to a 3rd party, the contract will state you as a homeowner cannot willfully do anything to disrupt the power to the grid. Some contracts will actually financially penalize you for doing so.  If you have your own microFIT contract with the OPA, you control how much power you are going to send back to the grid. The contract with the OPA does not stipulate that you cannot use power you generate.  One piece of advice, and I'm sure NightCrawler can speak more to this, on systems setup for the microFIT program, the inverters used on the systems run off hydro electricity - and not the generated electricity from the panels. As such, in the event of a power failure, your system will not send the electricity to any storage devices (such as batteries). The reason for this is it's better to sell 100% of the power generated by the solar system to the grid at the increased price, then buy it back to use in your system at a much cheaper price.  As such, a solar system set up for the microFIT program will not generate power for your house in the event of a power failure.  Now your other option is to forget the microFIT program all together. Just purchase a solar system, a set of batteries, and generate/store to your hearts content. In this option your inverter will be setup to run off the panels generated power, and not a hydro electric system, as often these systems are ""off the grid"" to start with. Requiring an inverter to have electricity to operate would defeat the purpose of the setup.  The final option, which has also been mentioned on here, is simply to lease your rooftop or land to a 3rd party company. That is simply a tenant / landlord agreement. You are the landlord leasing your rooftop or land to the third party tenant. There are many different companies that offer this service and as already mentioned, some are much better than others.  There is some misconceptions on this thread, however, overall its quite factual, which makes me very happy! Good to see the public is starting to learn the systems and benefits of solar power.  If anyone wants any advice regarding installers let me know. Oh, NightCrawler, upon graduation if you need any contacts in the industry, let me know."
829420,Entropy,2014-01-09 01:54:00,747,"I don't know a lot about this stuff but even if the grid goes down would the solar panels not supply power to the house (assuming the sun is shining). We can easily do without hydro for about 24 hours at a stretch and would only need enough to cool the freezers back down, charge up some batteries, pump enough water to get us through another 24 hours. To supply power to your house when the grid is down you would need a battery bank.  Me and my brother in-law helped our Father in-law install a solar system in his new house.  It has 15 m2 of solar panels on the roof, 12 x 6 volt (300 lbs each) batteries in the crawlspace, an inverter for the 120 v panel, and a separate inverter for his well pump 220v, as well as a stand by propane generator.  Just the solar system alone (not including any household wiring, nor the panel, nor the generator of the propane land tank) it cost him $15000 about 5 years ago.  That doesn't include any installation cost as we did it ourselves with a volunteer 'expert'.  The whole thing was inspected by ESA.  What he says he would do differently is #1 put the solar panels on racks on the land, because there is less cance of roof leaks (less holes drilled and caulked, etc) also because they have to be cleared of snow way too often. #2 install a diesel generator in a genny shed, with a fuel tank, as he has had several problems with moisture in the regulator and lines, and carb.   My advice, keep it simple.  your generator you have now serves you well when you need it. Sure it is a pain to get it out and put fuel in it, but it is effective.  Keep it that way.  Entropy"
829467,Big Cliff,2014-01-09 08:22:00,6899,"Well, it sure looks like the solar idea isn't the best solution for what I want to accomplish at least at this point. The propane whole house system would sure serve my needs and be a good way to go but that is a lot of money to spend for something I MIGHT need. My gas generator does do everything I need it to do but just isn't as convenient but it is here and paid for so I think I'll just keep it. I haven't had to use it in 5 years, we'll just hope it stays that way LOL.  Thanks again everyone for all your thoughts, ideas, and information! I really appreciate the time you have spent helping me to become better educated."

829927,mcdougy,2014-01-11 16:31:00,274,"I can add this:,  Your current roof will not be designed for the extra load. It will definitely need some alteration to take the added weight, It's a guarantee. Do not let someone say ""it will be fine"" and add the approx4-6 lbs p.s.f. Dead load. You would open yourself to disaster of liabilty in the event of a roof failure. Positively you would need a engineered stamp on the roof system ""beefing up"""". Again this is all protecting you from liability down the road or even the sale of the home in the future. Which does raise another question. What happens if you enter a rooftop system contract, and you have to sell the place. Are you limited to buyers that will ""honor"" the contract ?"
829932,Steve,2014-01-11 18:17:00,2075,"you have to READ your contract.  some will allow transferability, others will not.  the standard OPA contract that you enter into if you own the system yourself (not a rooftop leasing agreement) allow for transferability. But I've come across a few leasing arrangements that do not allow for transferability.  As always, read your contracts."
829942,John Bacon,2014-01-11 19:23:00,3277,"From what I understand, the government is currently paying people with contracts not to general electricity because it is not required with the currently supply and demand.  How does this impact a home owner's ability to sign a contract for a new installation?  Do home owners run the risk of paying for a new installation only to have Hydro tell them they are not interested in buying their power?  Alternatively, is Hydro beginning to add 'opt-out' clauses that will allow them to stop buying power when the demand is low?  Either way, the home owner gets burned."

829257,Big Cliff,2014-01-08 12:09:00,6899,"After the recent power outages I decide to look into getting an automatic whole house generator for our place. The gas one we have now would get us out of trouble in a pinch but the idea of having to get out there in the middle of the night in a storm to fill it with gas and things isn't quite going to cut it for me any more.  I priced out an automatic propane 8kw system and installed it would cost me about $7000.00 plus service every year. While I think it would be a good investment, it just isn't in the budget right now. It might be different if we were younger but we aren't.  Then I started thinking about the idea of solar panels on our roof. Being right on the lake with exposure to the sun from early morning right through until sunset I am sure would be an advantage. There is also our garage which is 1000 sq ft and it also has exposure from early morning to sunset.The other thing is that we will probably be getting our roof redone this spring or summer; can I kill two birds with one stone here and perhaps come out on top?  Apparently there are programs in place where the cost of it would be totally covered but how would it affect the existing roof (shingles) would they have to be replaced first?  What about the extra weight of the solar panels; would the roof have to be braced? I do realize that the solar panels wouldn't supply power at night or if covered with snow and ice but at least there would be power during day light hours for the most part.  I wouldn't have to worry about a generator that doesn't want to start or filling it up with gas. I wouldn't have to worry about running out of propane if the outage was extended for any period of time. and if I didn't have to lay out about 4-5 thousand $ to reshingle out roof that would be a bonus!  Have any of you got one of these solar systems or looked into them in detail? Any feed back would be very much appreciated!    "
829259,woodenboater,2014-01-08 12:34:00,2277,"Have seen a few houses that have panels on the roof and if you found a program that covers the cost of the panels, you're lucky. I think there was a FIT program but wasn't aware of any in Ontario that covered the the entire cost, all in. If there is, I'd be all over it like flies on you know what  PV panels aren't cheap and could run a homeowner over $30k plus the storage batteries and I think it's basically a given that you may not see any return, financially, for quite a number of years ((25+). In your case, having reliable power during blackouts is more important so that's worth more than a ROI.  Curious, there shouldn't be much work involved with an LP powered back up generator unless I'm missing something. A huge pig should ease your worries about running out propane as well. But as you mention, cost is another matter of course ."

A good payback period for a residential pv system can be anywhere from 8-15 years. A pv system will also last you 25+ years if well maintained. Upon that, it is very important that when or if you make the decision to install solar, you review your energy consumption in your home and look at ways to reduce vampire loads and lower overall consumption ( efficient lighting / appliances etc ) This will help down the road with your panels A PV system on your garage roof to supplement your home roof structure is fine; but keep in mind SOUTH I have talked to people who run solar pv companies, profs, engineers and even driven by homes with a system not facing south. All of them have talked about how the installation of a system on their projects that did not successfully achieve a south facing array did very poorly and cost the homeowner thousands in loss. Ask your self, Will the panels on my roof face south? Most homeowners choose grid tied ( benefit from the MicroFit program in ontario - that being you system is 10kW or less, unless you live in a mansion that is all you need ) when the grid goes down, there is a device with your system that stops the electricity your panels are producing from entering the grid ( this is mandatory and is meant so that hydro workers working on repairing lines are NOT electrocuted by your feeding into the grid ) That being said, grid tied or not, you will have battery storage ( more $$ but worth it ) your pv company will come up with a number of days based on your consumption history of hydro, usually 2-4 days, this will help to 'size' the battery bank for your home. So if the grid goes down, you have power from your battery bank for that period only. Its an investment, with a payback period, and an opportunity to make profit off it ( i believe the Microfit rate is now  0.55 cents/kWh ish down from 0.88 cents / kWh two years ago --- as the cost of panels decreases so does the incentive, the government isnt stupid unfortunately )But do your research...you can learn everything i did online and via books."

Most homeowners choose grid tied ( benefit from the MicroFit program in ontario - that being you system is 10kW or less, unless you live in a mansion that is all you need ) when the grid goes down, there is a device with your system that stops the electricity your panels are producing from entering the grid ( this is mandatory and is meant so that hydro workers working on repairing lines are NOT electrocuted by your feeding into the grid )  That being said, grid tied or not, you will have battery storage ( more $$ but worth it ) your pv company will come up with a number of days based on your consumption history of hydro, usually 2-4 days, this will help to 'size' the battery bank for your home. So if the grid goes down, you have power from your battery bank for that period only.  Its an investment, with a payback period, and an opportunity to make profit off it ( i believe the Microfit rate is now  0.55 cents/kWh ish down from 0.88 cents / kWh two years ago --- as the cost of panels decreases so does the incentive, the government isnt stupid unfortunately )  But do your research...you can learn everything i did online and via books.   You see, this is why I post questions like this on here, the answers are always informitive but then every once in a while you hit an answer like this! Truly awesome!  NightCrawler, you wouldn't happen to be going to school in the Lindsay/Peterborough area would you? If so I just might know of a place where you can fish to your hearts content in exchange for your knowledge on this sort of system! Oh what the heck, you'd be welcome to come fish here anyway LOL.  Lew, I guess it's like buying gas, prices come down when people don't need it as much but after this last round of stormes I guess demand has gone up. Just heard about a guy stranded in the Us in a storm, he went to get a hotel room, regular rate $129.00 a night but there was a line up in front of him. By the time he got to the desk to register the rate had gone up to over $300.00 a night. Apparently some lady bought bags of ice salt in Ajax drove them to Ottawa and sold them on Kijiji for $20.00 a bag. People like that should be shot! Anyway, lots of good information coming out of this and I really appreciate all the replies!"

We haven't had any real sunlight here in weeks.  Generac Natural Gas at 14KW was $2800.00 and $500.00 install by a friend then and now anywhere between $3400.00 for 8K to $4000.00 for 14KW system. No fuss no muss, always have fuel as we have NG and no leaving the warm home to refill battling 60K winds, not me, no way. You have propane, I'd forget solar Cliff."
829337,tb4me,2014-01-08 21:41:00,3295,"Cliff, I have a Miro FIT system on my roof. 3kw system. It wouldnt run my whole house if I wanted it to. As for the system itself its paid for in full from a company that rents my roof. After the 20 year contract I own the system, well whats left of it by then. There are many things to consider. The biggest factor to keep in mind is the winter. When we get all this ice and snow the panels wont generate any electricity... Secondly is the damn squirrels. They just love the solar panels they are constantly building nests under them and chewing the wires..This summer we had a hardware wire cloth installed around the entire solar array, they still found a way under and chewed a hole thru the shingles and were part way thru the sheeting and heading strait for the attic. According to the technician that was here, the squirrels are the #1 problem they didn't see coming..Its a major issue and be sure no matter who you decide to go with make sure they gaurentee any and all squirrel damages. . What a nightmare. Also your roof trusses may have to be reenforced. The company has to have a structural engineer inspect your truss system to be sure its strong enough to sustain the weight of the system and major snow load. If you have any further questions please dont hesitate to ask.. Im more then willing to answer what I can"

Been doing lots of research as I'm going to be installing a smaller system to run my cabin with a generator backup to help recharge my battery bank during the darkness of winter here.  You can do a grid tied system which will pay you back $$$$ for power sold to the hydro company but you will need a transfer switch, battery bank, solar controller etc....... For a proper system for your home you will be looking at double or triple the cost of the generator plus you have maintenance that you must perform on the batteries to keep them healthy.  Go with the generator if you only need it for backup power."

What they did here was install a green boot on the transformer that feeds the house. That way the hydro workers know there is a system running at that transformer. I have asked the company about having the panels power my house in case of power outage I was told no, sorry. So in order for me to do it id have to come out of pocket myself and run risk being sued for breach of contract. Its a long story but I don't recomend that company..They did my system and messed things up bad.. I sent you a PM with my cell # please by all means give me a call."

829377,Rod Caster,2014-01-08 23:32:00,5784,"I met some rural farmers who used their barn roof to sell power to the grid. Basically they financed the system, then sold the power to the grid for a much higher rate than consumer rate. They still have normal electricity bills, but they get even bigger checks for the power they sell and they got some Government grants. That covers their electricity and the financing and some income..... apparently, when the program started, they would build you a barn for FREE to install the panels. That program was eliminated years ago...I would have participated in that program in a heartbeat!  If you do a completely private system, you could have your own back up system. I'm sure you wouldn't need giant panels like you normally see, but I bet it's still a lot more expensive than a gas/generator system.  I wonder if a guy could sell solar power to people in the neighborhood and not connect to the main grid? Kind of a local/municipal power source? I guess that would be a BIG investment and probably impossible due to regulations and liabilities."
