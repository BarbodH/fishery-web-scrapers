830117,Nipfisher,2014-01-13 01:20:00,2449,I didn't go out today but yesterday was no problem driving. Lots of slush and water but 4 hi was enough to get on and off the lake.
828476,Bernie,2014-01-04 18:10:00,3190,"With the recent cold snap I thought the slush would get frozen, but if anything, it may be worse. There really isn't a lot of snow, about a foot, but it has drifted deeper and heavy in some spots, raising the slush. Trying to get off the beaten trails with anything but a snowmobile or a 4x4 pickup will be looking for trouble.I towed some fellows driving a van out of a snow drift (no snow tires).  This is out in front of my place. Took a few elevated RPM's to get through it the first time, but it pushed through OK.Went over it a few times to open it up a little.    "
828478,misfish,2014-01-04 18:39:00,29133,Bernie. You running that 4x4 with the tracks I seen at the shop? Thats the cats meow.
828481,Big Cliff,2014-01-04 18:45:00,6899,"Same thing here Bernie, lots of slush on many of the lakes. Not fun if you get a sled burried in it. At least with an ATV if you don't get hung up you can chew your way through it.  Good on you for towing those poor fools out, kind of stupid for them to venture out without snow tires at least."
828482,Bernie,2014-01-04 18:53:00,3190,"No Brian, driving the pickup this time. Lots of ice.The last few weekends I did take the ATV.The trail I just opened up should freeze. Although it will be a little rough, not much chance of getting stuck."
828490,aniceguy,2014-01-04 18:59:00,1094,Really good conditions here at smittys both ice road and fish!
828550,Cosmos,2014-01-05 00:21:00,588,Dave - owner is really cool guy.
828553,Nipfisher,2014-01-05 00:45:00,2449,There is a few spots bad with slush on Calander Bay as well. It is fairly visible in daylight so not too hard to avoid. We caught another 6 walleye in 3 hours today but I was talking with a couple guys who landed 27 walleye today.
828559,Bertrand93,2014-01-05 01:27:00,10,"Hey nipfisher, who are these ""guys"" you were talking to!!"
828608,jbailey,2014-01-05 06:18:00,866,"gotta drag my hut out this weekend, hoping it wont be too much of an ordeal (something always seems to go wrong sigh)"
828614,Rod Caster,2014-01-05 11:38:00,5784,"15"" of solid black ice in Callander Bay where we fished. Some areas had slush but they were few and far in between.   Pretty nasty looking slush in your neck of the woods!"
828618,aniceguy,2014-01-05 13:19:00,1094,"Costa we were in the 6 man, full limits here"
828645,Joeytier,2014-01-05 16:08:00,3990,Stopped by your shack yesterday in the sled around 11.  Guess you werent out yet.  Our Cbay spot was a little slow but still quite good.
828695,Nipfisher,2014-01-05 19:12:00,2449,Too many activities with the boys in the mornings. Looks like afternoons only for awhile.
828725,jbailey,2014-01-05 20:50:00,866,anyone going to be out next weekend in the south bay area?
828774,Cosmos,2014-01-06 00:57:00,588,Good for you. We got a limit too. But bite was too slooow. We had a fun anyways hope you had it as well.
830069,Bernie,2014-01-12 21:48:00,3190,The mild temperatures and the rain yesterday will be beneficial for travel on Nip.It knocked the snow down and brought up the slush. Once this freezes up it should make for easier going.I wouldn't want to try going through this soup right now.   Driving home today on a well traveled ice road.  
830070,irishfield,2014-01-12 21:54:00,26272,What's the new ride Bernie... and do you have the traction control turn off or on?
830071,Bernie,2014-01-12 21:59:00,3190,"Came across a 2008 4x4 Ranger with an off road package.Couldn't pass it up. Really like it. First one I have bought in a long time with less than 100,000 km. No trac control on it, thankfully. But I do like the ABS."
830073,irishfield,2014-01-12 22:12:00,26272,"Sounds great.. found that mine, buried in 22"" of snow with the trailer behind, on Monday is an absolute piece of crap. Can't rock F / R to work your way out .. as the computer controlled shift and throttle won't let you throw it in reverse until the idle drops below 1000rpm. If you have the traction control turned on it just locks the wheels and kills the throttle for a no win situation... and then out comes the shovels!"
830075,Bernie,2014-01-12 22:19:00,3190,"You need to disable the ABS in some way Wayne. There are a few ways you can do this temporarily. Pull the ABS fuse or short the low level sensor on the brake fluid reservoir, pull a wire off of one of the wheel speed sensors.PM me and we can go through some options for a switch hookup to do this "
830077,misfish,2014-01-12 22:28:00,29133,"Can you make a left turn oval track Bernie? Man ,that would be a blast with the Avenger.. Just make sure the banks are 4 ft high, At full speed,no need for ABS ,or brakes.."
830081,Bernie,2014-01-12 22:36:00,3190,Often thought it would be a blast to take out some old beaters and have a race on the lake Brian.No ice or snow tires. Just set up some pylons and go to it!
830082,irishfield,2014-01-12 22:39:00,26272,I can turn the T Control on and off... so I can spin the tires.. it's just the inability to throw it into reverse... just as you've nudged it forward at throttle that won't work. It has to idle down before it will go in reverse and there is no way to get a rocking rhythm going to get it moving.
830084,Bernie,2014-01-12 22:45:00,3190,"OK Wayne, I understand the situation now.Yes, that is a PIA."
830085,Rod Caster,2014-01-12 22:51:00,5784,I stayed off the lakes this weekend for this very reason. A good freeze will cure all.
