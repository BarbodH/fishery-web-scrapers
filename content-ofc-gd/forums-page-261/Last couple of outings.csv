829792,Jds63,2014-01-10 20:58:00,1365,Just thought I’d share a few photos of the past few weekend outings up in the Haliburton region.  Got into some nice Splake on early ice :      And got a nice 22 incher and some Lakers that were all in the slot : I know just disregard the Leaf attire … LOL    Tight lines … cheers
829798,Terry,2014-01-10 21:40:00,14456,very nice
829807,Old Ironmaker,2014-01-10 22:01:00,8243,"Very well done. Looks like a picture postcard day. I hope your better half dressed you for your outing, my goodness sakes, the Muple Lups? as my father says. Haven't seen a Splake for 30 years, and a nice bonus eye to boot."

829857,Jds63,2014-01-11 00:59:00,1365,"Thanks folks ... can't leave the flasher at home now .. just what you get used to I guess, sure has helped me put more fish on the ice compared to fishing without !  What's next ? Laker opener in Temagami for sure !"
