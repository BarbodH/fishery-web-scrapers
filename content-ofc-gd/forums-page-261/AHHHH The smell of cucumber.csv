LOL  Today was the day to try an old haunt that I use to get  whitefish. I even bought a new jig,that was pretty close to the green monster (color wise) I have not been able to find in a few years.   That jig was a white fish magnet..  Came across this little gem. It,s not a Rapala. It cost me $3 I bought two.LOL    As I watch it decend to the depths,I pause it at the 40 ft mark,50 and 60. As I just start to let it drop from the 60,this line barrels from  75 fow. It makes a bee to the jig. I stopped it,line is on it and wham. That was so cool to see.  The battle is on.  It was a fat whitie. It was bigger then I like to keep. As I dont freeze my fish. Cook fresh that day and would of been to much for the mrs,s and I.. So a quick pic,and back down the hole she went.    Ahh the scent of cucumber. I love it.   Oh ya,it,s a slush pit out there. Some areas there was over a foot. Dam work out I could use though."

830051,misfish,2014-01-12 19:54:00,29133,"The hooks are almost like the nils. Oh,and there aint no more of them. Tom only had a few,and they sold out fast.  Did I mention it was windy out there today? I hate wind,even in 0 temps. Decided to put the hub up. it was tricky. It almost got away from me. If it did,it would of made it,s way to Pefferlaw.LOL After I got the first screw anchor in,then the second,it was COMFORTABLE."

830115,Joey,2014-01-13 01:19:00,9122,Nice going B.  Must have been a sloppy mess out there today.  Kept us away.  Hopefully it'll freeze up by next weekend.
830142,Fisherman,2014-01-13 02:46:00,7201,So I'm not the only one that thinks their smell is a bit like cucumber
