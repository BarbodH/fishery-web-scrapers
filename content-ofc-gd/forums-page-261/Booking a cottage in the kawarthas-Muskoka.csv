For the bachelor party we'd like to find a cottage for probably 9 people on a lake that has some decent fishing, as most of us fish on a regular basis price doesn't matter too too much unless it's outrageous but it wouldn't be too wild and we are all very respectable people and usually end up renting a random place for a week in the summer together anyway and have had no issues in the past, we're looking into June/early July for 3 days, so I know people look for a week minimum which is why I ask here because we're only looking for 3 days.  If anyone has a contact or has a place they'd like to setup for a rental for a couple days please let me know!  Thanks Lucas"
827174,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-29 14:20:00,4399,23 years old + 9 guys+bachelor party= no cottage for you!!!
827176,leaf4,2013-12-29 14:26:00,2466,"hahaha, all respectable guys and the one getting hitched only wants something low key so we wouldn't be causing a ruckus if not for ourselves at least respect his wishes"
827221,Carp,2013-12-29 20:00:00,1488,"You'll have a bit of difficulty finding a place at that time of year for a weekend. June would definitely be easier than July.   Check here: http://getnorth.com/  Also: http://www.cottageconnections.ca/  Also check Kijiji or other similar sites for cottage or vacation rentals in the area(s) that interest you. Lots of private rentals advertised here.  I would not mention anything about a bachelor party. Those words send up red flags and you'll have even more difficulty finding a place. This is simply a group of anglers looking to get away for a few days. Have a good time and maybe even catch a few fish, but be respectful of the property and leave it as you found it....or better !  Good luck !!!"

830157,adempsey,2014-01-13 05:11:00,1498,"At that time of year, rates for a three day weekend will be close to renting for a week anyway.   So, just rent for the week.  Muskie Bay on Rice Lake has a nice cottage that sleeps up to 10.  I believe it used to be the owners house until they constructed a new one.  Elmhirst Resort on Rice Lake has some 4 and 5 bedroom cottages as well.  Pigeon Lake Resort on Pigeon Lake has some 4 bed cottages as well.  I prefer fishing on Pigeon.  GOM Resort on Jack Lake has a 4 bed cottage.  If you have the mucho dineros, there are some incredibly nice private cottages on Jack Lake."
