Using 'backlashes' is quite the excuse to purchase a Calais DC, I hope the wife went for it, lol!!!  Sorry, dashed this off in a hurry and does sound like bragging. In actual fact, wife suggested it after I had quit a pack a day smoking habit for a year after 25 years. With cigarettes at $90 a carton, the reel cost 6.6 cartons or thereabouts. Good incentive for those still puffing away? (although sometimes I do like a bit of second hand smoke just to remind me of a smoke after a good meal)"
829903,206,2014-01-11 10:21:00,563,I have never been beaten by a backlash I pick out my fishing buddies also. I seem to be better at backlashes than fishing. I'm with ya on that one!!
828054,cowanjo,2014-01-02 00:40:00,249,I have had so many I used to Rockhop for saltwater Fish in Australia (Google the Tubes  Jarvis Bay) we used to marlin fish and cast into the wind when necessary - I see Lucas comment above - I feel I am able to beat most as I worked on so many at night or early mornings - Lucas(Leaf4) btw first time with baitcaster for musky has one issue in four or five hours and nets two fish - he is a good fisherman (Netman!). I call my son luke Backlash boy - but he is eleven now and is unbelievable casting all day I do the trick above with him let him reef a cast then pull two rod lengths out and tape his reel with tape (His goal no backlash for eight hours musky fishing) man I would not have had the patience at eleven for ten minutes of fishing but he just keeps at it.  I will take photos next year for sure - great post mike P - funny and that one looks awesome. Roaring Dan - I have half your reels at my place so if you want it fixed bring it over problem is it is no doubt left handed.

Took me 2 years untangling line before I got the hang of making 3 casts in a row with out a carbunklememt on my first baitcaster a early 80's Shimano Bantam. The little pic that comes on those little black multi tools help. Then I used a good quality baitcaster and found that little Bantam is good for trolling and that's about it.  I'm going to try the electrical tape after a long cast, interesting. Anyone else done this or is it an inside joke?"
828183,Muskieman,2014-01-03 00:36:00,2472,Tape works well

828233,johnnybo1,2014-01-03 05:33:00,42,The good old backlash  My worst must of been the first time I got a shimano curado. I just spooled it with real expensive flouro and within 5 mins on the water I had backlashed so hard I had to throw out 40 percent of my new line I had just put on.  It didnt stop me by the way I kept fishing   and it turned out to be a pike fest. I love my curado hands down the best reel I have ever purchased I have had it for 5 years now and it works like I bought it yesterday.

828434,ChasinTails,2014-01-04 13:58:00,90,"my worst was when salmon fishing i had cast into the mouth of the river only for it to backlash, and the one time i didn't want a fish,FISH ON!!! so it took out like and the line got jammed everywhere, in the reel, the nearing, the line guide etc. now it just sits on my desk as it dosent work"

Worst backlash I've seen was a buddy with a quantum those blue pt tour burners.  We had a few beers, I just tuned the reel for him and we were at his cottage.  He took a cast for the patio , snagged a tree midway and the worst birds nest I ever saw.  Lol he didn't use backing, so straight braid down to the spool.  Took sooooooooooooooooo long to get out while cutting inch by inch of line.   That fool.  It was funny though and his new name is old thumb-er."

828487,aplumma,2014-01-04 18:58:00,6896,Worst backlash I had was when I put the rod out on the bottom and forgot to put it in gear. a 30lb catfish came along and started to run with the bait so I picked it up and set the hook in freespool. BIG MESS was the result so I handlined him in with steel gloves for the release and hacked the mess to pieces ruined over 100 yards of 65lb powerpro. Needless to say I haven't done this stunt again till the next time .lol   Art

Sandusky Bay here off of Lake Erie had a lot of old school wooden boat houses, most had trouble fitting anything over a 16 foot boat, big in the day? A bamboo pole made it really easily to drop your bait in just the right spot, and since Crappie were the usual target? a bamboo pole was all you needed.

827890,Handlebarz,2014-01-01 14:59:00,3790,So this summer I had some new friends out and as it usually happens one had a backlash but this was the worst I have seen Heck it makes the ones Dave Mercer has look small LOL. I took this pick before working on it I was able to get it out as he did not pull on it he just let it stop on its own and with 15 Min or so work it was out.  I did learn a trick for smaller back lashes to get them out it seemed to work OK at times. You reel the line back onto the spool then click the reel like your going to cast start to pull the line from the reel in short hard pulls as you thumb the spool keep doing this until you hit the knot it should pull free I was amazed when a friend showed this to me it works with heavy braid not sure about other lines or light braid.  
827893,i2cool2fool,2014-01-01 15:07:00,349,"That's a wild backlash! The thumb trick works really well. Sadly, I didn't fish much last summer and am craving a backlash (the fishing kind only)."

Good reason to stay with a full cork handle as itll give you a couple extra seconds to retrieve the rod, not sure if this happens to anyone other than me. in the summer i just jump in after it. in fall you just hit the trolling motor n hope like heck it doesnt sink!"

827980,kickingfrog,2014-01-01 20:45:00,8333,I don't mind paying for braided line. I figure it lasts longer and can be flipped over so it ends up being cheaper then mono in the end. But cutting 20 odd bucks worth of new line off a reel burns my berries.
