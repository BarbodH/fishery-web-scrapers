829781,Sinker,2014-01-10 19:45:00,8692,"Yep. I've had a cottage in wilberforce for almost 30yrs. Farquar is decent for lakers. You should have no problem finding them, and catching. I've had good luck fishing relatively shallow compared to most general ""laker"" depths in that lake.  Standard jigs and set lines catch them.  Good luck, and let us know how ya make out!  S."
