Electronic instrument cluster is a ""cluster"". Have you ever seen 11:77 on a digital clock? Odometer adds 100km after going maybe 5 km. Thumb warmers don't. Steering is like trying to parallel park the Titanic. They don't float or ride on top of the snow, they plow through like a submarine. Fuel use is a disaster, 35-40 litres to go 40 km.

829929,mcdougy,2014-01-11 17:05:00,274,"Also adding to the debate as somewhat stated in previous posts, is , depending on the size of the motor, is the only part of a mercury, a mercury, is the sticker. I believe tohatsu builds everything under 40h.p. for them. And this sort of thing happens with a lot of the motors, where as they supply each other with different parts. Lower ends, power heads ......I'm sure someone can give us a real lesson on who is actually building what...and then sticking whatever sticker on the cowling. Again I am referring to the smaller motors. I know for certain my 25 hp mercury seahorse is 100%. Tohatsu and can not get parts at all at the local mercury dealer. So far all I wanted was a oil plug . It seems like a nice simple motor. (Very few parts) Even simpler than my 15. H.p yamaha that I can parts easily at the not so local dealer, even stickers from Japan in a week. It now looks like a 9.9 on the cowling. When I bought the 25 mercury from port colbourne, they said as I was walking out the door. ""If it breaks, don't bring it back here""  but 2 stroke is what I wanted and my choices were limited for a brand new 2 stroke."
829941,John Bacon,2014-01-11 19:08:00,3277," Grazia Roy,  I knew you would know. So are they tied to Canada or is Bombardier owned offshore now as well? I don't get out much you know, and if it wasn't in our weekly paper out here from Caledonia (the Dunnville paper shut down) before I went back online last year I wouldn't have heard anything. The Hamilton Spectator only covers Toronto news now.  Thanks Roy. Keep up the great work.  Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP) is now a completely separate company from Bombardier who make planes and trains.  I believe that BRP is owned by the Bombardier Family, the Quebec gov't, and Bain Capital.  So they are still mostly Canadian.   Bain Capital is American; but they only own about 20%.  Sorry, missed this from Roy's link.  This changes the ownership structure.  BRP files a preliminary prospectus with the securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces and territories of Canada in connection with a proposed initial public offering of its subordinate voting shares. In May, BRP announces the closing of its initial public offering of 12,200,000 subordinate voting shares of the Company at a price of $21.50 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $262,300,000."

I have never seen a yammi under tow myself, but most boats I see being towed in are older and poorly maintained, and anything poorly maintained will fail.  I've owned merc, mariner (yamaha block) tohatsu/Nissan and Johnson/Evinrude as well as yamaha of different sizes over the years on various fishing and duck boats.  They've all been pretty reliable, but then I maintain things.  I do believe that the yamaha/Honda products have much greater longevity, but that is personal opinion your mileage may vary!"

Art That's probably the biggest factor.  I've seen enough guys doing the 1,2,3...101,102 pulls or running the starter til the batteries dead with black anchors.  Obviously some is due to no/lack of maintenance.  My Honda ran without a hiccup for 16 years and then needed some gasket work and a thermostat.  The mechanic that did it was amazed at the inner workings, still like new, almost no wear.  That motor is in the garage and waiting for one of the boys to get a boat.  I wanted to get another larger Honda(40) but the dealer I used before seemed to be having more interest in goofing around with his buddies in the shop.  I went to the local Yamaha dealer, appropriately welcomed,  clued into the brand differences and bought the same size 40HP for about $1000 less than Honda with better features.  The electronic idle/troll control was one of the features Honda didn't have nor did the Honda 40 come in a tiller model,  it's an accessory.  Reliability was excellent with the Honda, unfortunately they are falling behind with the upgrades.  Hopefully this Yamaha will keep me happy as long as the Honda did."
