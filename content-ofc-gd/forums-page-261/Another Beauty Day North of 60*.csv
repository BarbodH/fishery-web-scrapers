So I suited up and cleared my driveway!!! Been a long cold winter already and it's no where near 1/2 over yet. Looking forward to the third week of February when I take off to Florida on a much needed 6 week vacation.  Here is what it looks like after spending a little bit of time clearing the driveway in the Arctic in January.  Need palm trees, rum and sun!!!!  "
