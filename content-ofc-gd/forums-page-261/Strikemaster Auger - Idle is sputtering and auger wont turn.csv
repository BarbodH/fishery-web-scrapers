Changed the gas/newplug and problem persists. It starts but the idle is all screwed up... and the auger wont spin when given gas. Any ideas?  Anyone know of a guy that works on them in the Keswick/Newmarket/Surrounding area?"
829023,BillM,2014-01-07 16:39:00,17367,Did you run it dry at the end of last year?  If not you've probably got a gummed up carb.
829027,cityfisher,2014-01-07 16:42:00,959,yup ran it dry with sea foam. Started up fine this year.. used it for maybe 20 holes... now its acting up.

When I had the same problem, I found the advance acting up, there is small spring attached to the throttle mechanism and them to the butterfly on the carb, is it in place and in good shape? Can you manually actuate the butterfly? it should scream wide open when running There is an idle screw adjustment but I would concentrate on the throttle/carb first. Other than idle, does it run correctly? i.e. do you get enough RPMs to turn the clutch? Any small engine shop should be able to help"
829058,Garnet,2014-01-07 19:03:00,2056,Is it 4 stroke or 2 stroke.

It doesnt idle high enough to trigger the clutch and get the auger Moving.  Is it 4 stroke or 2 stroke. 2 stroke -- put fresh mix in Twice with Seafoam!"
829199,bigbuck,2014-01-08 01:48:00,2449,"2things to check, one is the gap on the spark plug, and the second is to pull the carb on it and clean the inside of it thoroughly with carb cleaner and then blow out the orifices with compressed air and put new gaskets and diaphragms in it. Google the manufacturer of the carb, you should be able to find a rebuild kit for it. I did for a 42 year old Pioneer chainsaw this past weekend. Parts are out there, you just have to dig a bit to find them."
830005,cityfisher,2014-01-12 12:48:00,959,Dropped off the auger at j&w small engines in Keswick.  Jim fixed it up !!  Carb was all gummed up and the diafram needed changing.  Cause was likely because of regular gas. Only premium from now on!!
830010,bigbuck,2014-01-12 14:29:00,2449,"Carb kit!!! If you do not want to run regular gas, run Shell premium, it is the only left without ethanol for now. If it is 2 stroke, run Stihl 2stroke engine oil in it. It has stabilizer added so you do not have to mess around at the end of the season, you are always running with it in the machine which also helps to keep it clean."
830025,cityfisher,2014-01-12 15:52:00,959,Def will go with shell premium! Thanks to everyone for their feedback.
