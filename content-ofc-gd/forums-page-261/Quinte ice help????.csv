826927,landry,2013-12-27 23:03:00,1005,"I would love to fish quinte for eyes this winter but I have no idea where to walk out from, park... Have heard it can be dangerous at times so that keeps me from trying. Is there anyone here that wouldn't mind sending me a pm as to where is a good place to start with typically decent ice and good fish numbers. I don't want gps coordinates. Maybe I could trade a musky trip or info for quinte info? Thanks Landry"
827232,landry,2013-12-29 21:07:00,1005,Wow. I thought someone might share a good access spot where I could start from. Not looking for coordinates.

827263,landry,2013-12-29 23:10:00,1005,Not lookin for safe ice reports. Just a good launch/parking spot where I can access those huge walleyea.  I will check the ice for myself when I get there. I never trust the ice unless I have tested it:)
827264,misfish,2013-12-29 23:14:00,29133,  LOL  That would be my first question.  Be safe.

827608,kevin booth,2013-12-31 13:13:00,57,"there is lots of safe ice around the bay now,being new i would suggest big bay or bellville or hay bay.always check yourself and i know there is alot of people have been out in these locations.i would stay away from every where else if you are new to area.have fun stay safe"

829890,landry,2014-01-11 03:45:00,1005,Unfortunaley I did not. I was coaching my sons team in a tourney and then it got crZy cold. I tried to get my buddy to go on Saturday but he talked me into simcoe lakers - and we got skunked.
