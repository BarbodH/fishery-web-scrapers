275462,Spiel,2008-12-04 17:30:00,9065,....I do. But I don't currently have any blanks for ice rods and I'm up to my eyeballs in musky rods right now. I'd be willing to bet your not wanting them for next winter!

I'm looking for a medium heavy, 34""-38"". Something nice and long for laker's and those quinte walleye."
