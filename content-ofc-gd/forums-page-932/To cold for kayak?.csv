273507,Cudz,2008-11-30 03:28:00,2652,Don't know if you are interested but THe bay in Barrie is still open.  Big smallmouth only 50 - 100 yards off the shore and the waves will not be an issue.
273532,cram,2008-11-30 08:27:00,1733,  I loved this.  Hilarious.  Laughed my ass off.
273637,irishfield,2008-11-30 17:47:00,26272,"The way I look at it.. you're safer in that yak now than those that go out during spring break up. The water's a few degrees warmer now, than it is in the spring as the ice is going out. Just pick your days accordingly."

275673,purekgw,2008-12-05 03:14:00,585,see guys its never to cold for yak
275675,danbo,2008-12-05 03:20:00,2646,"""YEE HAWWWWWW!"""
275697,Twocoda,2008-12-05 04:20:00,4130,"Its really rather simple...when in doubt ...dont go out.....only you know your skill level in the yak ..your tolerances to water are pretty much the same for everyone give or take a few minutes should you end up in the drink...are you willing to pay the price ? foolishnss is in the eyes of the safer people ( ones that live long lives)...but in the eyes of a progressive adrenaline junkie that has succussfully conquered extreme adverse conditions its just another day at the office to share a story possibley with a fish in hand...( our hobby is expensive beyond belief when the price is a life)...(...condolences to his surviving friends and family should they be members of this forum ) Personally ...i choose to live but ill still be out on the water come spring derbys..in extreme adverse conditions with frigid water and 2-3 second intervals in 15 - 20 footers ...but i know my skill level ,tolerances, equipment and the price it may cost...its what we do...Evryone of us is an adrenaline junkie  at some level...why else would  stand in a river for 5- ??? hours for the rush of landing a fish.... Golfing is too boring unless its lightning out .....but i would never want to climb Mount Everest.....when my time comes....i can only hope that it is doing something i lived to do  BTW...i had a close call ice fishing in alberta 19 years ago ....and havent ice fished since...."
273179,purekgw,2008-11-29 03:04:00,585,i wonna get my kayak out one last time i wonna go to a marina on erie to fish for some pike. But is it to cold what do u guys think?
273186,Pigeontroller,2008-11-29 03:17:00,2793,"With the proper cold weather(water) gear and a buddy its not. I wouldn't recomend paddling alone at any time of year, especially now."
273190,purekgw,2008-11-29 03:19:00,585,well i dont have any float suit or any thing but i wont be that far from shore and sadly none of my fishing buddy's have a kayak
273195,forrest,2008-11-29 03:26:00,1032, Ask the water cops how long before your muscles cannot work proper if you go in.  Then ask what your life expectancy is if you go in. I bet its not long.  forrest
273197,purekgw,2008-11-29 03:29:00,585,lol forrest just threw my idea down and walked all over it
273198,kemper,2008-11-29 03:34:00,2232,With a floater suit... yes it would be okay.  Without one you probably dont have very much time to get back in the thing and get the heck out of the water FAST.  Might as well be falling through the ice at this temp
273202,purekgw,2008-11-29 03:38:00,585,ok thanks for your reply's im just going to stick to shore
273205,Leecher,2008-11-29 03:42:00,7832,Wise decision on your part to stick to shore fishing Will keep an eye out for your report Leechman
273209,danbo,2008-11-29 03:49:00,2646,Ditto!
273222,charlied,2008-11-29 05:14:00,584,i was thinkin also of putting the kayak out one more time but Erie has been so windy and wavy  i said forget it.  sucks sometimes being 3 blocks from the lake and can't use the yak.  And i have a float suit and don't think i would go in this time of year.
273231,Greencoachdog,2008-11-29 08:23:00,8163,If you have to ask... then yes.  I believe there was a foolish person in a kayak that drowned on lake O about this time last year.
273233,Rich,2008-11-29 10:04:00,3927,"He was anything but foolish.  Unfortunately, mother nature teamed with a great lake proved that you can never fully prepare for what they throw at you. I wouldn't be caught out there in frigid temps in a kayak.  However, I did once see Sleded swim across the channel at Hoover's Marina in a floater suit at the beginning of March."
273235,chickenhawk,2008-11-29 10:10:00,612,yeah i wouldn't refer to him as foolish....some of his close friends are on this site.....can never tell what is gonna happen out on those big lakes....   Hawk
273244,NAC,2008-11-29 13:23:00,369,"Not to worry Pure unless you make a habit of falling out of your kayak.  There's always the drysuit debate, but that is generally when going out into the lake.  If your just paddling around near shore, you can still be very safe with your chest waders and a waist belt and of course your PFD on top.  The pressure of the water on the waders is more than sufficient to not allow even a trickle inside when the waist belt is on. Its been proven more than once.  here's the most recent video -  Of course common sense toward weather and waves is really where you make your decision here.  Paddling with another as suggested above is never a bad idea either.  I paddle and fish from ice-off to ice-up and have since 2001 and have never come close to landing in the drink. My other suggestion would be that if you aren't confident in your skills, then don't do it."
273250,jediangler,2008-11-29 13:34:00,1923,"It has been nearly a year since the kayak fishing community lost one of our greatest ambassadors, Serge Lapointe (aka Titowoody). He was a very experienced kayaker with the proper cold weather gear on but did venture out alone. A freak snow squall blew up and a change of wind direction spelled disaster for him. I had heard someone was going to set up a tournament in his home province of Quebec with proceeds going to his family. Better to just stick to shore fishing, we don't want any more memorial tournaments."
273257,Greencoachdog,2008-11-29 13:47:00,8163,"I'm sorry if the term ""foolish"" offended anyone, but in my opinion it was just that! If I lost my life under the same conditions I wouldn't blame anyone for saying the same about me.  I won't debate this subject, that was just my opinion."
273269,NAC,2008-11-29 14:07:00,369," I'm sorry for the feathers this may ruffle, but I totally disagree.  The weather we got that day is exactly what had been forecasted regarding the wind speed and type of weather to be expected.  We fished the gorge at Niagara from shore that day and debated before we went if it would be worth trying to fish with the amount of wind, rain and ice pellets that was forecasted.  We got absolutely blasted all day, even way down in the gorge.  It would blow up for about a half hour and then calm down for a half hour all day long. The event of the snow squall could not have been predicted, but all the other warnings were in place.  I knew him too, although not as well as others.  He was very competent and experienced, wore a dry suit, carried GPS and VHF."
273316,purekgw,2008-11-29 17:23:00,585,im not going to be out in the open lake ill be in the shelter of a marina and very close to shore and i have never come close to flipping my kayak i have handled musky at the side of it and never came close but do i wonna risk freezing
273376,Rich,2008-11-29 20:27:00,3927,"Hmm well we went out for a drive looking for a spot to fish a couple weeks ago and a snow squall came up, some idiot flew down the hill in a water tanker and almost side-swiped us. Are we foolish for going out looking for an open spot to fish?"
273393,danbo,2008-11-29 21:20:00,2646,
273396,Rich,2008-11-29 21:38:00,3927,Foolish inuit!
273420,danbo,2008-11-29 23:05:00,2646,
273423,purekgw,2008-11-29 23:23:00,585,well we went and well only thing i got was frost bite the wind was deadly and wouldnt let up so we went to a small creek near by and managed to get 1 small rainbow
273438,Greencoachdog,2008-11-30 00:16:00,8163,  
273452,purekgw,2008-11-30 01:29:00,585,......... no ones foolish
