275282,holdfast,2008-12-04 03:42:00,1813,"Thanks for posting, always looking for good movies and this one looks like a Winner"
275284,fishnpro,2008-12-04 03:44:00,93,Just watched the the trailer and I think I might go rent it. Looks like a good movie.
275286,Twocoda,2008-12-04 03:48:00,4130,Its kinda funny ...we wer just saying the other day that there was crap out for movies....but i think i would actually enjoy this one.....the new Get Smart movie (surprisingly) actualy mad me laugh twice
275321,Wendel,2008-12-04 07:27:00,213,"this movie has some really bad acting but has a really good story.  I'd give it a 4.5/10, only because I love dogs! I watched a movie the other night called Step Brothers, if you like Will Ferrel you would love it... Here are the scores of some other movies I've watched recently...  Rightous Kill  6.5/10  DeNiro and Pacino, some good parts, but those guys aren't getting any younger! Wanted  5.5/10  Probably one of the best stories that turned into the worst movie... Angelina wants this one back I bet! Traitor  8/10  Had me at the edge of my seat for almost the whole movie, makes you think that's for sure... The Dark Knight  7.5/10 I was expecting much better honestly, Although Heath was so awesome as The Joker, he made the movie The Mummy III  6/10  Why do all these Archealogists all of a sudden have offspring working alongside them? Pineapple Express  4/10 Seth Rogan is funny, but maybe I should have inhaled to watch this one lol Quest for Fire  7/10  Not much dialogue here, but if you do watch this oldie check out how the different tribes utilize technology. City of Men 6/10 I was disappointed, I thought this film would relate more to City of God(8/10)   I guess you can see what I do when I'm not fishing lol"

275348,Clampet,2008-12-04 12:57:00,1947,It looks really good. Thanks fer the tip.
275437,ssminnow,2008-12-04 16:30:00,48,I watched it last weekend and thought it was pretty good.  Half the movies I watch these days I feel like I have seen before because they just rehash old story lines so this one was a nice change.  I would recommend  it.
275623,Mattones,2008-12-05 00:43:00,587,  So blockbuster should have it? I may go rent it tonight.
