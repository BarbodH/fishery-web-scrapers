275840,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-05 17:36:00,2050,"what's your secret?!? lol Mine just went up $200 a month!    When they gave me the original quote my wife's accident last year didn't pop up on her record...   of course my lack of complete honesty came to bite me in the behind - now I didn't lie, I just didn't say ""hey wait a minute, she has an accident, shouldn't my insurance be more expensive?"
275849,ccmtcanada,2008-12-05 18:18:00,7971,They need to break even so I'm figuring they took the $200 from Johnny's policy and put it on yours.  Guess they figured what were the chances you'd both be on the same public messageboard.
