275669,Cudz,2008-12-05 03:11:00,2652,Got the Trombly's flyer in the paper today and a Helly Hansen 1 piece survival suit is on for $228.  Seems resonable.  Does anyone know if it is the one with the suspenders inside?
275735,BUSTER,2008-12-05 11:43:00,1336,"alright i tried google and came up empty,  Trembley's?  is what and where i assume an outdoor store but couldnt find it on-line"
