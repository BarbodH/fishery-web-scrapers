274501,qaz,2008-12-02 15:26:00,26,"OK I got a new mother-in-law that likes cat fish, and i was telling her about lings and she wants to try them.  She live in the Lemington/Kingsville area of Lake Erie.. I can catch Lings right off the beach or the creek mouths in the area.  Can She eat them or will it be a    to the hospital or worse?   I mean getting a mother-in-law out of the way is maybe every guys dream, but feeding her toxic fish is not the way to do it.  P.S. I skin my lings so that I am left with a skinless, rib less ""fish roast"" on a spine, never cut the belly.  So in short are they non-eatible or is it   time."
274502,BITEME,2008-12-02 15:30:00,1969, They are eatible
274515,Ramble,2008-12-02 15:57:00,713,This maybe of use for future referance. http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/envision/guide/
274522,wuchikubo,2008-12-02 16:35:00,1114, Looks pretty safe from that book.  I'd like to try them myself one of these days.
274524,centerpin_drift,2008-12-02 16:51:00,94,"Ling are defintally edible, especially from places like erie and lake temagami.  The main body meat on a ling is very tough and kind of chewy when cooked, but most of the aboriginals have told me to fillet the tail piece from the anal fin down and cook it like any other fish.  If you insist on eating the entire body of the ling, cut the rest of the meat into small chunks and make some kind of ling stew out of it.  Every year they have a weekend in temagami called the Ling Fling where all the ling are collected from the weekends catch and a mass stew is made on the ice for a Ling Fling cookout  Mike"
274553,hammercarp,2008-12-02 18:25:00,964,Your right the belly meat is too fatty and jelly like but the meat from along the back is snow white and very firm while the meat from the tail section is good too. I have eaten their roe and liver fried in butter. The liver is very mild and the roe is tasteless mush. One more thing I was not aware that ling/burbout were in lake Erie. Are you sure your not talking about bowfin?
274593,highdrifter,2008-12-02 19:58:00,2534,"How shallow are you catching them?  I thought they were more of a open water kinda species.  We pull them often in Lake Temiskaming, but it's usually through the ice, some ways from shore.  If you can bear the stench, I hear they're just like cod!  Like Mike said though, the belly meat should be cut off.  Can we see a pic??  cheers HD"
274600,solopaddler,2008-12-02 20:16:00,8605, You would make a fabulous Fear Factor contestant!
274604,Ramble,2008-12-02 20:27:00,713, LMAO that he would!  -R-
274613,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-02 20:43:00,3761,Does anyone have a picture of a Ling?
274705,sonny,2008-12-02 23:52:00,511,i'm inclined to think he's talking about bowfin??
274708,kerr,2008-12-03 00:00:00,77,if they're burbot then eat em. i catch em all winter and hope to post an actual report in a few weeks when i get back from florida. i eat them all the time in winter as that is the only time i catch em but through the ice they are relatively easy to catch. real tasty. dont eat dogfish. dont do it
274710,Beats,2008-12-03 00:03:00,543,Hopefully vman will make an appearance and verify he is talking about the same fish that he thinks he is.
274735,Abberz,2008-12-03 00:40:00,140,Here's my man Kerr at a burbot party from last Christmas.         You can definately eat them and judging by Kerr's face he loves these fish almost as much as he loves the ladies!

274757,Greencoachdog,2008-12-03 01:13:00,8163,"I've always wanted to catch, cook, and eat one of those... on my ""to catch"" list!!!"
274796,qaz,2008-12-03 02:21:00,26,"THanks for the info guys(and gals).  I am slow getting back to the replies because I am at work driving in the States.  I am talking about Burbot.  They live in cold water and taste great after you skin them, which removes the skin ribs, guts and belly.    I am not talking about finger trims AKA Bowfin. Which like warm swampy water..  Burbot are more active in the winter and spawn some time about mid-winter. I mean I've seen a burbot that was grabbed close to the tail by a pike of equal size turn around and eat the pike."
274812,jwl,2008-12-03 03:01:00,1056,there is Ling in Erie...it's not bowfin I gather the guy is talking about....I know for a fact they are in the lake...Bigugli got a nice one in the river end of last winter down the road from my house..a huge one probbaly 12-13lbs
274823,bigugli,2008-12-03 03:15:00,6138,"You mean this thing.  Near as UGLI as me   Never saw a tomcod this big before. Wasn't a clean catch, hooked in the side of the head so I never weighed it. Swam off to get fatter for someone else."
274843,Beats,2008-12-03 03:53:00,543,Nice catch there.  Seems like almost all the pics you see of them are in the winter.
275311,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-04 05:31:00,2050,"Man I used to catch those on Lake Wanapetei through the ice as a kid!  I would LOVE to catch some on erie considering I live down here now...and from shore to boot?!?! to cool man! Make sure to send us over a report!  cheers, UF"
276224,qaz,2008-12-06 13:08:00,26,"Well Karen and I are heading down today, I just hope the ice in not piled up along the shore..I think the little creek will keep it clear, but you never know.   We're fishing at night so will what to see it in the day light first.   I'll try and get pics of the trip."
