This gave me enough time to start my Xmas shopping and I was able to escape to a local trail that I had never been on. Overall I was a little perterbed by the significant lack of wild life on this trail......  Here are a few shots that I took....keep in mind I'm getting used to the camera and i suffer from some bad camera shake. I heard it through the grapevine that santa is dropping off a tripod for me at my parents place           Lots of ruin and old buildings in this area....      This Mallard decided to float by me on the river  "
275576,Beats,2008-12-04 23:13:00,543,Nice pics.  No better spot than the woods to take some nice pictures.
275759,Leecher,2008-12-05 13:38:00,7832,"Great shots FishnNAutographs On the first pic, is that a deer rub on the tree?"
275761,bigugli,2008-12-05 13:51:00,6138,Nothing wrong with those pics at all.
275765,NAC,2008-12-05 14:16:00,369,"Walter Bean, Grand River Trail by chance?  near the Humane Society"
275766,fishing n autograph,2008-12-05 14:21:00,2540," yup, i went right instead of going left towards the old bridge......"
275767,fishing n autograph,2008-12-05 14:22:00,2540," not sure, i'm not a hunter so i don't exactly know what a rub looks like"
275769,Leecher,2008-12-05 14:26:00,7832, The tree in the forefront has a beige spot that looks like a deer rubbed it's antlers on it.... but could be mistaken
275771,Whitespinnerbait,2008-12-05 14:34:00,2038," The deer must have a square head ,cause the SPOT is awfully square looking to be a RUB"
275772,fishing n autograph,2008-12-05 14:34:00,2540," it's a strong possibility. I was in an area which is creeping close to what's called the ""Conestoga Corridor"" which is a part of the Grand River Valley that runs on the north end of Waterloo and the surrounding edges of Kitchener. According to the GRCA the corridor is home to approximately 150-200 adult white tails.... I've seen a few large bucks and does but they were closer to the village of Conestogo.."
275773,NAC,2008-12-05 14:35:00,369,"All the wildlife hangs out closer to the river near the lower trail.  Too much traffic on the upper. I used to run theat trail 3 days a week from the Lanc parking lot to Bingemans and back.  Nice inner city escape and if you time it right, there is a gold mine of fiddleheads in the area."
275777,fishing n autograph,2008-12-05 14:40:00,2540,"yea, i've come to appreciate what the grand river offers....lots of wild life to see if you're lucky, however, like i said, other than a pair of cardinals and the ducks there was nothing to be seen. I was even hoping for a rabbit or two lol...  i've come across more deer along the RIM park trail on the north end of Waterloo by the golf course than the Bingemans area...."
275780,Leecher,2008-12-05 14:46:00,7832," Cool than it just might be one     If there is that many deers and you've seen a few, be on the look out next time you go back..... you might even come accross deer scrapes on the ground."
