I didn't buy it because I already have one, and love it, and if the wife wasn't 5'2"" with cute blue eyes, I'd make her pull the second one!"
275985,ravinerat,2008-12-05 23:56:00,64,Cosco in Barrie now has Exuinox Trailboggan with tongue on for $269. These are a fairly good quality and will last for years. I have had mine over 10 years. I can refer you to a thread on toboggans on one of my snowmobile sites. It's quite extensive. Remeber you get what you pay for.  You can email if you need the like.     RR
