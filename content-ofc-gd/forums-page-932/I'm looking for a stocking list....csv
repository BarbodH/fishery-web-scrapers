I think its Frontenc county. My last step is calling the MNR office. But if some one has it i'd appreciate getting a copy, so i can for-go the run-around.  Thanks  -R-"
275991,ravinerat,2008-12-06 00:00:00,64,I think I do. I'll have a look through my piles of papers. Send me an email with stocking in the title and I'll forward.  RR

They're small lakes and kind of hard to get to in the summer, but if you had a light canoe you could do it.  I've also heard they can be really on shortly after first ice up."
