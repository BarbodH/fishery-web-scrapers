275508,wuchikubo,2008-12-04 19:24:00,1114,"Umm, I don't think so, but where's the property and how much are they asking for?"
275531,bigugli,2008-12-04 20:29:00,6138,"There used to be all sorts of strange looking homes, and people, in that neighbourhood years back. The face of one house used to be plastered in hubcaps. One yard was all pink flamingos. 'Aunty Doreen' and her cat haven always left the basement window open for all the neighbourhood cats. The 'Librarian', didn't know he had died til we smelt him 2 weeks later. A really different neighbourhood. My apartment was only a 5 minute walk from work at the Greenwood yard."
275560,misfish,2008-12-04 22:11:00,29133," Dosent look good for deer hunting, so I say, NO THANKS. Not the history had anything to do with it."

275590,mbac31,2008-12-04 23:47:00,904,Forget everything else. Imagine you were the guy that lived in the other half of that semi. Jeebus. Looks like one of those games that you toss rings for a toy you see at the CNE each year.

275686,huntervasili,2008-12-05 03:56:00,1604," Ha... Wonder how much value, or at least selling possibilities the neighbor has lost for his house cause of that... As mentioned definately should be some law, maybe a max # of garden gnomes or something... But that is probably profiling so I suppose it wont happen"
275779,Pete Maina,2008-12-05 14:46:00,213,"Amazing! What a place.  Yeah, to be a neighbor"
275781,Billy - Curtiss,2008-12-05 14:48:00,241," Yes it is! I've eaten slices there more times than I can count. Upstairs at the Monarch Tavern, Kaplanski is churning out the most outrageous smoked meat sandwiches this side of the eastern townships as well!"

273710,irishfield,2008-11-30 22:34:00,26272,LOL Regal.. you've got that right. Can you imagine being their neighbour...
273712,pigeonfisher,2008-11-30 22:39:00,696, Is San Francesco on Clinton St?  with the other sandwich shop in the white house (restaurant) beside it?  In my past I enjoyed some really nice hot italian sausage in those places.  And the Hot Meatball...YUM
273715,Bernie,2008-11-30 22:41:00,3190,Ya and where do you put all that crap when it isn't outside? Along with the Halloween stuff and the Easter stuff and the..............   No wonder there are storage buildings all over the country.
273717,fishindevil,2008-11-30 22:47:00,6254,"Can you imagine his hydro bill ????.  ....that is if they are all lighted,talk about fire hazard,thats just waiting for a group of kids to go to town ......"

273747,Clampet,2008-11-30 23:39:00,1947,"Bernie, they never store that stuff, it is on display 365 days per year. Here is a pic of it today.. and a couple of last Winter..    "

273750,irishfield,2008-11-30 23:42:00,26272,No wonder the neighbour on the left has planted trees and built a privacy fence up to their door.
273752,Bernie,2008-11-30 23:47:00,3190,"I'm usually not one to say ""there ought to be a law"" but in this case if there isn't - there should be.   I bet there are a dozen cats in there too."
273772,holdfast,2008-12-01 00:20:00,1813,"Never mind that, the cops might call in the Riot Police.  Looks like Hell is going to break out of there."
273803,Clampet,2008-12-01 01:22:00,1947," If hell were to break loose, it would of happened a long time ago, that place has been around fer a few years.  If you look carefully you can see the sign warning of the closed circuit camera."
275372,muskyhunter5150,2008-12-04 13:31:00,64,I've seen that house before there was a write up about it in either the Toronto Sun or Star.
275395,lew,2008-12-04 13:57:00,12767," Not that it matters Jed, but Jones & Dundas is a loooong ways from East York  JUst clarifying the story for you"
275396,Headhunter,2008-12-04 14:02:00,5703,"That place is only a couple of blocks from my old house, near Dundas and Greenwood. I gotta admit that my kids loved going past that place... even funnier was the look on their face, but funniest was me squirming trying to answer their question...  ""Daddy, why do these people do this????"" HH"
275399,wuchikubo,2008-12-04 14:18:00,1114,"Paul, those pics gives me the creeps! Certainly, not the common yardwork decor!"
275430,Headhunter,2008-12-04 15:53:00,5703,"I forgot to add that not only is it a residence, it also appears to be the warehouse that supplies all of T.O.'s dollars stores! LMAO HH"
