275930,Fisherman,2008-12-05 22:34:00,7201,"Depends what you're fishing for, you can make your own basic tip ups from scrap wood, if you're looking at the thing with the flag, well I'll leave that alone."
276046,Leecher,2008-12-06 01:34:00,7832," HUKDONFAWNIX,  For wooden: The best bang for your buck would be to make your own out of 1"" x 2"" x 4' of white pine....  that you can get at any hardware stores, it's cheep but involves a bit of work.   It's the reason why I don't buy the ones at CTC or Walmart, simply is a rip off in my opinion..... I started to make my own and really pleased with the results.  Here is my latest model that I made and will be using this coming hard water season      For plastic: There's the windlass like Clamp-it recommended, reliable and efficient but a little expensive and cannot comment on...... will leave that to your decision  Hope this helps.... tight lines Leechman"
276052,fishindevil,2008-12-06 01:43:00,6254,"I have been using the windlass for years,and think they are great !!! they are very durable,and if there is a wind they will jig up & down for you,and they are only about $20 bucks !!! or ya can use a homeade one,i have lots of different tip-ups,and all of them will do the job...."
276089,DANIMAL,2008-12-06 02:36:00,215,"Windlass tip ups work great, especially for dead bait. But since the spool stays out of the water it tends to freeze when temps get below zero. So if you are only going to get one, I'd go with something with a submerged spool like the standard Polar tip up."
