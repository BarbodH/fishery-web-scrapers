272202,jwl,2008-11-26 17:35:00,1056," gee thanks Rory, trying to make me really busy???, I just got finished last weekends derby  I will post details as I pull this together, I am waiting on some feedback as to a day, how many boaters ect..I just planted this bug within the last hour or so..not sure if this is going to be a wekday or weekend yet pending feedback..it's short notice, but a bunch of us nut cases will be fishing the next couple weeks anyways..the basic idea is a boater/non-boater day..we need to get a feel for boats before opening seats up...5-10 bucks entry fee, winner gets bragging rights(probably some sort of award) and all the cash goes in as a donation.  I am just tossing this around so I will keep updated as the next couple days goes by"
272263,Hellfish,2008-11-26 20:01:00,308,"LOL @Jack, this whole time i thought i was doing u a favour   If u need a hand let me know bro."
272320,jwl,2008-11-26 23:09:00,1056," I got a couple boats on board as of this evening, we just haven't hammered down the actual day/times yet, gonna see what works for most, you already know Hellfish there are a few of us who are going to be fishing in the next couple weeks a bunch anyways...so this will just give an extra reason and for a good cause to get out there.   Shouldn't have a problem about needing a hand I know alot of people will step in if I do...what I will need though is my 2 way radios..lol"
272322,Daplumma,2008-11-26 23:15:00,1961,The meaning is clear douG.Hard short term support is on the way but it still takes at least a week from the states. Joe
272330,douG,2008-11-26 23:23:00,2693,"God Bless, Joe.  Happy Thanksgiving!"
272702,Rich Clemens,2008-11-27 21:44:00,3131,"Because of the distance, it's hard for us Southern Boys to participate in som ethings.  Thank God this ain't one of them.    Hittin' the mailbox tomorrow morning."
272843,ctdd2006,2008-11-28 02:19:00,531,"I still have a few craftsman tool sets I can donate ( I own a sears dealer store).  They are new and in a box.  They are the ones you see ""on sale"" every other week in the flyer for 19.99 down from 79.99.  I have quite a few different  sets I bought to donate for cases like this.  I don't have pics though!  I can take a few tomorrow with cell phone and email to someone?  Perhaps they would be better served for the Niagara derby as prizes seeing as the proceeds are going to this worthy cause anyway???  Let me know.  I'd love to help."
273148,aplumma,2008-11-29 01:32:00,6896,Make sure you shake the envelope Joe sent.... I'm to cheap to buy my own stamps..... get well soon Rick and call if we can be of any more help.  Art
273395,jwl,2008-11-29 21:26:00,1056," any fellow OFNers going to be in the area next Saturday????, that's the day I think a few of us are going to get together and go fishing out on the river..a fun day fishing, and a bit of help for a good cause.  As for the tool set, thanks alot for the offer, I was going to try and figure something out so that the winner of the day could get a bit of recognition and perhaps go home with a little something.  It's nice of the offer, I am not doing this to try and take away from the cause..perhaps the tool set could be auctioned off, but if it was offered as a prize for a fun derby like I mentioned it would be put to a good cause, I have a couple boats and about a dozen people committed to the day..waiting to hear back from a couple more"
276174,ctdd2006,2008-12-06 05:38:00,531,what's the date?  Where's your nearest Sears store?  Tools will be out on Monday.  good luck!
271428,TJQ,2008-11-24 18:52:00,7806,"Over the past few months one of our moderators has seen a dramatic decline in his heath, that has affected his ability to work more than a couple days a week.   I count him as one of my close friends, as many many users here do.  He has been involved in helping me here since I can remember running any and all versions of my message board and keeping me calm when we run into trouble.  I have talked to him and he begrudgingly has allowed me to help him out in this fashion.  We've helped out numerous people here who have needed it, and now its Rick turn.  He has spent many many hours on this board moderating and making sure that everything runs as smooth as possible and I think its our turn to pay him back.  He just needs some help to get over this hump and through some surgery so he can get back on his feet again.  I am in the process of organizing some auctions on his behalf, and if you want to help right away, you can send some help his way at:  Rick O'Banion 14 Haight Street St. Catherines, ON  L2P 2M1  Lets get together and show everyone, once again, what kind of a community we have here."

271649,bigfish1965,2008-11-25 06:19:00,3382,"Thanks to all you guys. It has been quite a challenging year for me. I am seeing the surgeon on the 11th and should have a date set soon after. I am not looking forward to getting this type of surgery, but I have been battling this since the spring and all other options have been exhausted. Six months of this was just too much and waiting longer was creating other risks.... I am not looking forward to the recovery, but it has to be done. They seem fairly sure the cancer has not returned, but the damage has to be repaired and the growth have to come out. Get out the ice packs."
271789,Roy,2008-11-25 19:24:00,13728,HERE's a link to the auction forum.  Thanks very much for your help folks.
271792,Fishmaster,2008-11-25 19:29:00,920,I have a 2 Man Channel Cat Charter that i could donate ...
271884,DT10Sam,2008-11-25 23:33:00,480,"Well Rick is one of ours here on the forum, count us in and I will find something to send to the auction.  Kind Regards, Sam"
272010,douG,2008-11-26 02:46:00,2693,"We are seeing some very nice support here, that's how we roll at OFC.  What we need for Rick right now is some hard, short term support, if that meaning is clear.  A letter to TJ will result in a forward to Rick, with no names attached.  An auction is still a great idea, for the longer term.  I will definitely bid on a guide package, any takers?"
272197,Hellfish,2008-11-26 17:20:00,308,"Niagara River Steelheaders is putting a tourny on in early December, Niagara fishing has been invited and OFC should come down as well, the derby will be held from queenston on the Lower Niagara River, all proceeds will go towards Rick . Will post details later."
