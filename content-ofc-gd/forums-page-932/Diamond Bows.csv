275464,bassjnkie,2008-12-04 17:32:00,1101,Sorry found the info I needed. Apparently there made by bowtech.  Sorry again
275468,richyb,2008-12-04 17:35:00,774,My buddy has a diamond marquis and its a very quiet and fast bow.
275552,bucktail,2008-12-04 21:29:00,1857,"The Diamond Black Ice is a nice bow, very solid back wall but jumps a hair I found. Good deal for the money tho!! I boought a Hoyt Katera and love it, smooth, fast and forgiving."
275597,huntervasili,2008-12-04 23:55:00,1604,"I shoot the Diamond Justice, works great, not a problem with it so far. They are made by Bowtech they only use a single freedom cam though unlike the bowtech bows. I would recommend it as they are a good value and high quality bow. And they have the new model for this year out. It is in the BPS flyer for around 350 in a package..."
275602,danbo,2008-12-05 00:01:00,2646,There are very few BAD bows these days. It's all about adding the best components & set-up.
275621,Mattones,2008-12-05 00:36:00,587,i use the 08 Diamond Justice  BPS has a deal on an 09 Diamond package for under $400 Im tempted aha
275635,bassjnkie,2008-12-05 01:25:00,1101,"Thanks, sounds like it a good bow. I will let my buddy know. For me I think I will put an AlphaMax under the tree this year, I love the cam and 1/2.  Thanks again Daniel"
