With the extra 10 pounds I've picked up in the past few weeks I'll be able to make it through a tough winter.  Won't starve."
275818,TennesseeGuy,2008-12-05 16:41:00,957," I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'll take personal responsibility for making it through any recession.  It won't be my first challenge.  Any problems with it, go with a PM."
275829,Hotrod2066,2008-12-05 17:12:00,40,I think the recession would end alot sooner if the media would let up on the negativity and the sky is falling crap. The media feeds on negativity and makes things out to be alot worse than they are in reality.
275832,OhioFisherman,2008-12-05 17:16:00,6623,"Just some tough times ahead, numbers for next year are also gloomy, unusual for retail to be losing jobs in November, a time when they are usually doing some hiring for the Holiday shopping.  No one yet seems to have a good plan to fix the problem, just rumors of job creation when the next Prez shows up for work.  You have to think the tourism industry will be affected to a degree. A time to consider spending choices."
