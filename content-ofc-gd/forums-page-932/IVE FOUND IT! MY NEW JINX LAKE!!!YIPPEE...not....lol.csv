I only had a couple of hours again, but had already scoped out a spot that seemed to have walleye from what i was seeing on the sonar.  The spot i had found was half way across a 150yard narrows, where the weed/mud gave way to a more rocky bottom from what i could tell on the sonar.  I did however decide to drill holes at intervals from that half way point the remaining 75 yards to the opposite shore as the rocks on the opposite shore hit the water line vertically which usually means  steep if not vertical drop-off, just wanted to explore this tiny section of a new lake....see whats around and perhaps find a honey hole for when i drag Chuck and Dave out....wouldn't want them to start whining ""ah...there's no fish here""....lol.   Well, it went exactly as the last  trip...PIKE...PIKE....PERCH...PERCH....PIKE.....PIKE....PIKE....SOME MORE PERCH...PIKE....etc...etc... some nice aggressive pike....so lots of fun.  It was really cold yesterday.....minus 18 celcius with a wind gusting straight up the narrows at up to 33kmh....dont even wanna think what the wind chill was!   Anyway...after about an hour of non stop pike / perch action i headed back to the middle to get the evening bite where i had spotted plenty of what looked like walleye the day before.  I had also noticed that the walleye (if thats what they were, were shy of jigs and liking just the hook and split shot presentation, and had a rod set up that way already.  I dropped one rod down with a jig, then set up my sonar on the hole with the split shot/hook/minnow rod.   What followed was a comedy of errors....   As soon as i dropped the split shot line down the hole,  a very walleye like line on the sonar graph started to investigate my bait....just as that was happening...my other rod tried to dissappear down the hole....ran over...took the little jackfish off and back to my other rod.  The walleye was just sitting under the bait still....i gave it a slight twitch and it nailed it, unfortunately my reel was not working at all well, the handle kept coming lose, and the bale arm kept freezing in the semi open position...hard to set hooks and reel up.....anyway....this one did not get off....until its head poked through the ice....and IT WAS A WALLEYE...A BIG ONE TOO.....straight away i had my hand in the hole...but it was hard to grab the fish with my mitts on...so i quickly threw off the mit......and made another bare handed grab...getting my whole arm wet as the fish evaded my attempted grab dissappeared under the ice again. DARN IT!!!! am i jinxed on this lake or what!  The minnow was still on so i quickly dropped it back down the hole, watching the descent on the screen...it had made it half way down the 9' water column when the whole screen lit up as a huge Jackfish grabbed the bait and snapped me off.....AAARRRRRRGH.  I could not re-do my line as my hands were freezing already from the icy dunking,and after my frostbite episode last year i was not de-mitting (is that a word?..lol...is now) and with only 15 minutes left because of a dinner invitation that night...time was pressing and the walleye were too suspicious of the jig (i tried numerous jigs, different colours/size the day before) so i left waleyeless again...at least i know they are there....but it does feel like i'm jinxed as far as walleye go on this lake...lol.    Heres the piccys from my 2 hours yesterday. Did not take too many as it got really cold and i put the camera away with lots of hand warmers stuffed round it!                                         "
