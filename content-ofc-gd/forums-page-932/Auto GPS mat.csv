276023,lew,2008-12-06 00:55:00,12767,I don't like the idea of a suction cup mount on the windshield for a GPS and was thinking of getting one of these mats that sit on the dash. Acording to the right-ups and reviews they seems like a good idea and evidentely stay in place without slipping.  Figure I could just slide it under the seat to keep it out of sight when not in use.  Anybody ever use one ??  
276074,Beats,2008-12-06 02:25:00,543,"Can't say I've seen that before.  Seems like a decent alternative though.  Does it say how heavy it is?  Is it filled with sand, or do you fill it yourself??"
276084,tschirk,2008-12-06 02:32:00,261,I have the Garmin 4 legged bean bag version for when I travel & rent a car. It works great!
276114,Flyboy,2008-12-06 03:15:00,26,This morning I've seen the 4-legged Garmin sand filled base for 30% off (manager special)  at the Future Shop on Kennedy/Lawrence. Be aware the RAM type 'ball' mount may only fits selected Garmin GPS units. Check it out if you are in need of one. I have no experience with this type of mount so I can't comment on it.
276116,BillM,2008-12-06 03:18:00,17367,"Lew, you didn't get a dash mount plastic peice with your unit?  It has double sided tape on one side, and smooth plastic on the other.  You just use the suction cup against the smooth plastic like you do the windshield..."
276118,TennesseeGuy,2008-12-06 03:19:00,957,I use the same one as Ted for my Garmin.  It does the job and is worth the money$.
276192,lew,2008-12-06 10:37:00,12767," Thanks boyz, perhaps I'll check out that 4 legged item too.  I saw that bag for $25 on the  Tiger Direct site and they also sell it at Cabellas for about the same price and figured it was a good idea . I have a feeling if the thieves see the palstic discs  or suction cups they'll take that as an open invitation to bust into the car, unfortunately, but these bags could be easily hidden outta sight somewhere.  I don't have the GPS yet, but I had a long discussion about it with Santa and he (She) thinks there a great idea too so it may just be under the tree in a couple weeks"
276233,qmccharlie,2008-12-06 13:33:00,9,"I have a square bag for mine, got in on the internet and it was only about fifteen dollars. Works great."
276270,sonny,2008-12-06 16:23:00,511,"Hey lew,,my fathers garmin has the same type of bean bag thing and he has no trouble with it,,,and does exactly that,,throws it under the seat when parked!"
276284,Beats,2008-12-06 16:52:00,543,Sounds like it's worth purchasing.
276342,John,2008-12-06 18:40:00,2956,Definitely go with the bean bag rather than the windshield mound Lew. Great system and nothing is drilled or damaged.  J...
