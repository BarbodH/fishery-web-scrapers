So for our Svensk and Suomalainen members, and the harfers in between, Nothing like fresh baked cardamom cookies. Fresh from the oven.     I was worried I had forgotten how to make them. had a couple of false starts to the batch, but all is good now."
275960,kuhaman,2008-12-05 23:25:00,503,"Looks just like the cookies my mom used to make, YUMMY!"
275961,wuchikubo,2008-12-05 23:35:00,1114,"Stop that, I'm still at work and won't get dinner for another hour!!!"
275984,Fisherman,2008-12-05 23:55:00,7201,You...are being cruel to my tastebuds.  Now I'm going to have to look for my Moms recipe for those.
275993,Beats,2008-12-06 00:05:00,543,"Im a gingerbread man myself, but those look like some good cookies."
276010,bigugli,2008-12-06 00:41:00,6138,They are kinda like a ginger snap or butterscotch cookie. I'll be making snaps later. If I get really ambitious I might give Gram's shortbreads a try.
276066,misfish,2008-12-06 02:07:00,29133,"Although they look tastey,no one,AND I MEAN,NO ONE,can beat my late nans Mallasses raisin cookies. Hell I would eat them frozen solid ,right out of the freezer."
276100,Leecher,2008-12-06 02:53:00,7832,Bruce that looks real delicious.... good job But have to say that those would of been a good addition to the supper I just had Jacques
276142,bigugli,2008-12-06 04:22:00,6138," They will be put on the table tomorrow as part of a smorgasbord and fish fry.  My family used to always put up a huge open house at Christmas, but it faded away a few years after Gram's passing. 50-60 people would pass through our doors on Christmas eve, or on Boxing Day, for food, laughter and friendship.  It is a tradition long overdue.  Hyvaa Joulua ja Onnea Udele"

276375,bigugli,2008-12-06 19:53:00,6138,Right in the good old 5 Roses cookbook under butterscotch cookies. Use either the vanilla for flavouring or replace with Cardamom.
