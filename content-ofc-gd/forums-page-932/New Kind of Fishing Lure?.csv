275655,Greencoachdog,2008-12-05 02:32:00,8163,Amazing!  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28042380/
275662,purekgw,2008-12-05 02:58:00,585,wow lol
275665,Beats,2008-12-05 03:04:00,543,The story doesn't explain much.
275666,Leecher,2008-12-05 03:06:00,7832,Amazing is an understatement.... more like a freak moment  The guy that lost and found his ring should go out and buy a lottery ticket    it's his lucky day
275667,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-05 03:08:00,3761,"Wow that is a unbeleiveable story, kind of wondering as to why someone would keep a 8lb bass but atleast something good came from it."
275668,Dondorfish,2008-12-05 03:11:00,1000,Hey Wayne - they just might find one of you cameras yet!  Don  
275671,purekgw,2008-12-05 03:13:00,585,he might not have kept it bass like to puke all over
275672,Greencoachdog,2008-12-05 03:14:00,8163,  I'm pretty sure it was a Mexican fishing for Russian Sturgeon that caught the American Bass with the ring in it's stomach...  
275695,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-05 04:18:00,3761," I have never caught a largemouth that puked up anything, lot's of smallmouths however."
275698,Bernie,2008-12-05 04:20:00,3190,Can you fix up a jig in those colors Glen?
275752,Greencoachdog,2008-12-05 13:08:00,8163, You read my mind Bern!!!
275795,Bly,2008-12-05 15:50:00,1556,In the 1980's I was often told my earrings looked like fishing lures......maybe I should see if I have any left and try em out
275826,Bernie,2008-12-05 17:04:00,3190, 5 year old girls should not have been wearing earrings in the 80's Bly.
275834,smbhunter,2008-12-05 17:24:00,186,Cool story.
275867,douG,2008-12-05 19:15:00,2693,"Pretty dang smooth there, Bernie."
276077,fishindevil,2008-12-06 02:26:00,6254,"Good one bernie !!!!...lookin for brownie points eh ??? well he is very lucky to get it back but,how did it get inside the bass ????....man i better send him an e-mail lol..lol.."
276091,Bernie,2008-12-06 02:37:00,3190, Don't kid yourself there Shawn. Women rule the world. Gotta keep on the good side of them!
276214,Rich,2008-12-06 12:38:00,3927," Trust me, they do! Usually October/early November.. they gorge themselves so full that they puke while you're bringing them in the boat.  As for the story, that is almost unbelievable. lol the real story probably is he stole it from the guy in 1987 and felt guilty so made a crap story about a bass up now. LOL j/k"
