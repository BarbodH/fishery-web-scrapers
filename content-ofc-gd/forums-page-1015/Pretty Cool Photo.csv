214227,snag,2008-06-11 18:11:00,1932,"Cool,  I always love those shots. They are a metaphor for life.  What happened next?"

214234,snag,2008-06-11 18:21:00,1932, Hahahahaha
214244,Stoty,2008-06-11 18:38:00,2910,Thats pretty sweet. I wish that would happen to me one time!
214245,Kirk,2008-06-11 18:39:00,347,"At our cottage the end result would be guests having a choice of pickerel or pike fillet, pike landed by Easton"
214247,Stoty,2008-06-11 18:47:00,2910,Ha ha ha
214261,Joey,2008-06-11 19:28:00,9122,Pretty cool pic for sure.  It would seem fair to say either way the end result is that the pickerel is toast  Joey
214264,addy79,2008-06-11 19:35:00,573,nice....
214310,MuddyWater,2008-06-11 21:45:00,218,i was on scugog once and had a stringer with about 3 nice wallys on it. i noticed the string jerking and thrashing and i looked in horror to see about a 20 pound musky mauling one of my pickeral their was 2 casualties of my walleye and the musky slowly swam away it was wild.
214319,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-11 22:01:00,3761,Cool picture.
214369,bigfish1965,2008-06-12 01:03:00,3382,There's days on the French River where you can't get a walleye in without a pike crushing it. Makes me wonder why there aren't more big walleye coloured pike/musky baits.
214382,mattyk,2008-06-12 01:12:00,2110,i also had that happen on the french river. Pretty cool.
