214289,Mike the Pike,2008-06-11 21:07:00,3421,Well as some of you may have seen on the News we got nailed with F1 force winds here on the South-Shore of Montreal.111KPH winds  It is day 2 and still no electricity  Hydro Quebec informs us we may have our Power back by 11pm tonight.  Did anyone see the news with 7 over turned trucks on the Champlain bridge.  I have never seen so many trees blocking so many roads.  Luckily for me we have minimal damage just some broken eaves.  Well its bed early again tonight with the wife not so bad I say.  No OFC  At least its not cold like the 1998 ice storm.We conceived my son that cold January  Mike

Picked up my kids at my parents as they did not have school and my parents may be back on line late tonight.  One block from their home there were 2 hydro polls cut in half and hydro was putting up new ones also saw a tree section 30 inch diameter complety ripped from the tree.Its messy out here .  So much for going to bed early with the wife she will be surely itching to get back on facebook  Mike
