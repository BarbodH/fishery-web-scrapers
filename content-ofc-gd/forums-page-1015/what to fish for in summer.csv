I have been fishing for rainbows on the Maitland last fall and this this spring.  We are looking forward to bass season opening in a few weeks too.  As the pic shows below, botbot and I are also fishing for carp now( thank to the posts and help on this board)  I personally enjoy being on the river and  my daughter (botbot) just likes catching fish bigger than the ones I catch.  What types of fish could we have some fun catching together from shore?  Thanks  Splashhopper and Botbot  "
