214097,cranks bait,2008-06-11 11:38:00,721,I tried the search and got nothing.  I just bought a Navionic Gold card for my boat.  It comes with a Fish'n chip offer that says US only.  I know people have gotten the Canadian ones.  Just not sure how.  Could someone please let me know.  Thanks

214155,SlowPoke,2008-06-11 14:39:00,2984,the Fish'n chip would be pretty useless in Canada. You might be confusing this with the Hotmaps chip. -Brian
214162,mbac31,2008-06-11 14:45:00,904,Fishin chip was usless here. I did get one for the Southern US from my cousin buying me the unit. Great for US but not for here.

Not that I will use it much, but I'll have it.  And yes I do have a NY licence to fish there, as I end up in their waters all the time."

But i compared the gold plus and the free chip and didnt notice any more detail ........its free for a reason if you ask me."
