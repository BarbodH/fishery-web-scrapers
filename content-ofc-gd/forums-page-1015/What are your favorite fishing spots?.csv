Asking for these spots is considered untactful.  I put in years of research for every spot I fish.  You are naive to think that people are willing to provide this information.  It's akin to standing on Bay Street and asking every passerby what their salary is."

BTW, your secret spots are most likely alot of other people's secret spots"

207206,Rich Clemens,2008-05-27 21:39:00,3131,Weedbeds with a healthy bunch on cabbage or reeds. Rocky shoals  - open water or coming off or in proximity to islands. Guess it depends on what I'm fishing for.
