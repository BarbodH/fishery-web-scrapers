214216,Entropy,2008-06-11 17:53:00,747,"I need to replace some drywall right beside my new bathtub / shower insert.  What kind of drywall do I buy when I go to Home De pot?  Is it called green-board or blue-board, Iâ€™d like to buy which ever is more / most suitable to getting wet.  Thanks Entropy"
214220,packrat,2008-06-11 18:00:00,93,"It used to be called green board but now all Home depot carries is the ""blue"" board.  Both will do the job in the bathroom for you.  BTW stuff is not moisture proof-----it is however moisture resistant. If sealed properly takes a lot before it breaks down."
214231,dannyboy,2008-06-11 18:16:00,367,"Either blue or green will do, neither is really suitable to get wet but should be fine with an insert. Cement board is recommended under tiles.  Dan"
214251,misfish,2008-06-11 19:12:00,29133, I was going to recommend Cement board. Much more durable.
214255,workwear,2008-06-11 19:15:00,592,cement board is..with no question more durable.....but if it is a finished wall.....no tiles on top......then the blue board is recomended.....   good luck
214274,misfish,2008-06-11 19:54:00,29133," I was thinking he could plaster over the cement board, just recces it in a bit,but you are correct,if he dosent want to."
