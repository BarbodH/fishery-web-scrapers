If you have fished it for the Bass opener, please give me some input as to if it is worth heading up their for the opener, and if this tactic I described is what you would recommend. Also which part of the river would be better to fish, the upper stretches by the dam or the lower slow sections at the outflow of the mouth ? PM me if you'd rather  Thanks Dave"
213774,charlied,2008-06-10 19:32:00,584,i would do it if I were you.   I fish the grand river near caledonia in the summer with my float reel and floats and have great success with dew worms.

214367,packrat,2008-06-12 00:59:00,93,You might want to give the Bighead in Meaford  a shot as well if you're going to try for bass.  There is/used to be a Kids Derby on----last time I was there lots of small bass but you could get surprised sometimes.
214415,CLofchik,2008-06-12 02:09:00,854," I used to work in Brantford and spent some afternoons drifting pools with either a tube for bass or corn for carp.  You can find tube hooks without weight or DIY jig hooks, I found you really want to try and get a tube drifting horizontal."

214443,charlied,2008-06-12 03:15:00,584,"sell the pin...LOL, good one.  A pinner would never sell his pin unless upgrading.  I might try my fly rod this year for bass, could be interesting."
214451,danbo,2008-06-12 03:43:00,2646,I sold mine..do miss it sometimes! Dig the fly fishing more.. throw a bunny leech or hair mouse at 'em!
214473,Bojangles,2008-06-12 05:06:00,46,Some of my biggest 3.5-5lb smallies have come out of the Beaver river.. they do come in and its a spot that's good to hit for bass.. minnows are deadly there
