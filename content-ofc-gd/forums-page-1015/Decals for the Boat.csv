213435,muskymike,2008-06-10 02:32:00,772,"Hey all, I need some help.  I am going to be re-painting my Aluminum Boat. That means off with the old Lund Decals and time to source out some new ones. And some fresh Paint to make it look snazzy.  Now I am not sure about that part. Does anyone know of any graphics guys that can or if there is a place that carries the decals? Its a Lund WC-14. I am going to snoop around the Lund site to see if I can find anything out.  Any direction would be great.  Thanks in advance guys (and ladies)"
213439,danbo,2008-06-10 02:37:00,2646,See your local SignMaker/Painter . They can do anything these days.
213451,workwear,2008-06-10 02:52:00,592,you might wanna try ebay...there are some pretty good decals for a reasonable price......being sold and not as a bid item   just a though
213457,Mike the Pike,2008-06-10 03:04:00,3421,  Yup what Danbo says .  I am in the business I sell supplies to the sign makers they can do it quickly it would probably take weeks to get those decals from lund.

213463,Dondorfish,2008-06-10 03:08:00,1000,  Hey Mike - I was gonna say you can say that again - but I see you did ( double post )  -  LOL  Don
213483,forrest,2008-06-10 03:55:00,1032,"Do a before paint job, then after paint job pic.  Call Lund and they may send for free.  It is free advertising for them.  forrest"
213543,Guest lundboy,2008-06-10 12:27:00,0,"Lund decals will cost about $200.  That's what they are for my Mr. Pike.  If the ones you have aren't too fancy, it might be cheaper to get them from a sign shop,  but even some of those guys gouge pretty bad on vinyl cutting."
213546,corvette1,2008-06-10 12:34:00,1765,i got mine from the local lund dealer for my pro-v
213549,muskymike,2008-06-10 12:39:00,772,"I know there is a guy on here, I remember seeing his post when the Tourny was just starting. I cant remember what team or what his screen name was. Hopefully he will read this."
213944,forrest,2008-06-11 00:21:00,1032,"  $200!!???  I almost choked on my dinner.  If its a big decal package with pinstripes I can see that....but what about those smaller 8 by 14 ""Lund"" stickers?  forrest"
213999,Guest lundboy,2008-06-11 01:52:00,0," Just Lund logo, with long underline...  The fancy graphic stripes were a second decal kit that ran about the same price.  Seems the Lund logo is patented and the graphics are copyrighted.  So they charge big bucks."

214025,forrest,2008-06-11 02:39:00,1032," I take it that you are saying that someone else holds the copyright to the logo...strange.  If its a Lund logo......they are gouging.  Buy L U N D in a nice but plain font and put near transom on each side.  go to trade show or call up other companies for free logo....mercury, yamaha, OFC, Starcraft  and Pay a pin-striper for a custom graphic.  forrest"
214054,Guest lundboy,2008-06-11 03:44:00,0, Yep gouging.  They hold the copyright themselves.  Or I should say Brunswick does.
214056,danbo,2008-06-11 03:59:00,2646,How about some cans of Tremclad & some Masking Tape & try your own design or copy some others?
