212996,Smokey,2008-06-09 12:49:00,1278,Anyone know of a secure parking spot to leave a vehicle between Washago and Huntsville?  We are making the annual fishing trip and are going to meet in the area and take only one vehicle up this year. So I'm hoping to find a spot to leave a vehicle that would be safe.  Thanks for any ideas or suggestions.  Mike
