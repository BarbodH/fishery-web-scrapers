Was fishing the bank of this spot and seen several, and i am guessing that is why we cought no fish there, but as we were walking along side the bridge i saw another school of these fish. sorry could not get a side view but the best i could do from the bridge.You can see the shadow of the fish in these pictures. Also there is the area we fished.Just thought i would share my story"

213888,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-10 23:06:00,3761,It is hard to see and was hard to get a picture of.here i zoomed in on the middle pic. It is a gar pike just can't see the side of the fish from above but from the banks you can see them perfectly.

213907,danc,2008-06-10 23:35:00,4677,"Mike. If your camera can accept add on lenses, pick up a polarizer. If it can't, holding your polarized fishing glasses in front of your camera lens works in a pinch too."
213909,danbouck,2008-06-10 23:37:00,4380,  Don't feel bad I can see it in the picture!

213950,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-11 00:28:00,3761, Thanks a lot guys
214098,Victor,2008-06-11 11:39:00,1609,I see them alright lol. Have you tried catching them? (is there's a season for them? check the regs if you are to try ... i have no idea)  It'd be nice to catch one of this cool looking fish
214117,rhare,2008-06-11 12:02:00,387,"I can see it dude,   very cool fish, super aggressive on the right days. when I was in Niagara and port D I saw a bunch of them, lots here in Gbay too.  try this---  get a piece of nylon rope about 5"" long wrap the one end tight with clear hockey tape about a inch wide, burn the tip so it doesnt frey. thats your body. unwind and tease the other end. I put a sickle jig head through and push the barb through the tape. gives you something to tie on to and the barb will keep the rope on the hook.No to mention hook pike if they are in the mix. The Gar's little teeth will tangle into the nylon rope, dont set the hook or you will rip the rope out. Just apply steady pressure.  here's a pic of a hookless. "
214281,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-11 20:08:00,3761, Thats kind of cool. Might give that a try
214304,steve_paul,2008-06-11 21:33:00,658," That looks like something you don't find in the water, it looks like something the ladies buy at the store with Brown paper on the windows."
214314,splashhopper,2008-06-11 21:49:00,2931,saw some gar pike off the north shore of Lake Erie ( Oxley) last weekend while on a men's retreat.  forgot the camera but caught some small catfish( 5-10 lbs).. a lot of silver bass (1-2lbs) and some sheepheads(2-3 lbs)  no perch and no walleye   Splashhopper
214316,danbo,2008-06-11 21:53:00,2646,"Did you know, they got armour like skin? I taxidermied one years ago & had to use TinSnips to cut the skin, Just like thumbnails!! Dang."
214317,splashhopper,2008-06-11 21:56:00,2931,  I just tried them sitting here at my PC. lol
