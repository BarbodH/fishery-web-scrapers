211782,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-06 14:13:00,2050,"Hey buddy,  as you know I love my bluegill and I would try rock bass but for whatever reason the rockies in the lake that I fish are usually infested with those little black spot parasites..... I don't see why  they wouldn't be tasty though!  cheers, UF"
211790,TJQ,2008-06-06 14:24:00,7806, LOL... ill draw a picture....  ya...  i think I have an old photo somewhere...  
211801,fishinggeek,2008-06-06 14:35:00,325, Thanks for the recipe!    I hope to try it this weekend.
211802,fishnsled,2008-06-06 14:36:00,3520,  We may just have to try this on the fly-in trip this year.  We will substitue the rock bass for walleye though.
211814,TJQ,2008-06-06 14:48:00,7806,If ya want... throw some lemon juice and some garlic salt in the cavity while your cooking it.......  makes an old boot tasty!

214452,Stern Rules,2008-06-12 03:45:00,342,"I've asked Italo about rock bass and he said they're good to eat. I think he mentioned them being better in the colder months like the fall but they are good apparently. If he says so, believe it."
214643,Beans,2008-06-12 17:50:00,3339, Dang it Boss !!!...I woulda kept that 12 pound carp I caught last Tuesday if'n I had known...probably taste close to your fish...
211515,packrat,2008-06-05 23:26:00,93,"Have eaten RB over the years----used to get some with my Dad in the spring.  Took them home fried them up, Mom made french fries and if we were lucky had some wild asparagus to go with it all.  Didnt get any better then that."
211537,TJQ,2008-06-05 23:49:00,7806,Ya sorry about that!!!! through the mouth and the open cavity and stick it in the tail.... my mistake.....  it hangs upside down on the stick.
