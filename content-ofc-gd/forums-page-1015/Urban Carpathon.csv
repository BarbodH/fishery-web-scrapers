213160,kentooley,2008-06-09 19:25:00,208,Hi All  Made a couple of new friends from here (Anton & Andrew) and went to my not so secret carp spot on Sunday. Had a great time and we all got into a few fish.  Some of our friends also dropped by with one of mine catching her first ever carp...fun to watch.  Hope to do it again soon. Hope the pics aren't overkill. Enjoy!                        Her 1st Carp.  Pleasure meeting you guys!  Chris

213371,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-10 01:17:00,0,Nice! Looks like a carp fest! They have started to spawn and the action is picking up now!
213425,Victor,2008-06-10 02:22:00,1609,wow that's a darn good day! I was so tempted to head out to that spot on Sunday but I had to spend time with family and the girlfriend. Congrats on a great outing! Always nice to see some OFNers get together
213733,sharper,2008-06-10 18:38:00,279,"Looks like a crowd started developing as the day went on, great catches!"
213785,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-06-10 19:41:00,160,"  Well we got plently of comments form the on-lookers as well  we were standing to the side of a walk bridge, and some do not realize this and say things... sometimes stupid things... this girl (mid 20s) walks by and says to the folks who were walking with her “I just don’t understand how this bridge is standing!!! I mean, I don’t see any support underneath, can someone explain this to me?” lol, this bridge is about maybe 30ft in length, just across the creak! I guess what’s common sense for many could be very trivial to some"
213805,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-10 20:06:00,3761,I like the colors on them. Congrads on your success
214350,tjsa,2008-06-11 23:56:00,1578,"Great report Verminator, and I like the bucket hat. I work at Lakehead University, and I believe I remember seeing you. You would have definately seen me, setting up data projectors and laptops for profs to teach their courses."
214471,FishKing,2008-06-12 04:30:00,5,"christ, thats amazing! looks like a lot of fun"
214513,1leggedangler,2008-06-12 12:10:00,364,"What a CARPTASTIC Day!!! Those are some big freaking fish. Congrats on a awesome report!  Cheers, 1leg"
214526,tonyb,2008-06-12 12:42:00,1637,Just awesome!  I think it's pretty amazing that you can go get those numbers of fish from shore at pretty much anytime of the year and they are usually into the double-digits!  Good carpin' and also nice to see you drew a crowd from the people out for a walk.  It's always fun to show people that there are lots of healthy fish in Lake Ontario  Most non-fishermen think it's just a big cesspool and I'm sure that contributes to the blaze attitude people have about littereing/polluting in general around the waterbody.  Thanks for sharing! Tony
