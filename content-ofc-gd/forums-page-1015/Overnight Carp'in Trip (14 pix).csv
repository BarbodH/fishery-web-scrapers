204299,wolfville,2008-05-21 14:08:00,396,"  Yup, I'm been so wanting to go since last year.... Fished with Rich once in a different swim, didn't get him into any carp but sleded did get into a 24lb on his 6' rod.....they're definitely people I'd fish with any day."
204372,nautifish,2008-05-21 17:31:00,1416,Nice Job Victor.  Am hoping to get out again this evening and fish  for some Carp.  Been a week now since i last wet my line or it is two.....Heck i dunno i just know its been too long.....lol......
204422,Golfisher,2008-05-21 19:52:00,586,"That's enough carp porn to last me for the rest of the week.  WTG, guys!"
204610,frozen-fire,2008-05-22 02:22:00,542,wow... now that is a hardcore carp outing. i gotta get in on some of that!
206818,splashhopper,2008-05-27 01:59:00,2931,"when night fishing for carp, do u use a light on the tip of your rod to let you know u have a hit? Or some other set up ?  thanks splashhopper"
206820,MJL,2008-05-27 02:04:00,2427," All 3 of us have electronic bite alarms.  When a fish runs, they beep and there's an LED light that flashes.  We also use swingers/hangers which allow us to know if something is playing with the bait.  The lazy man's way of fishing "
206833,splashhopper,2008-05-27 02:15:00,2931, Electronic alarms? swingers and hangers?  sounds like a porn movie from the deep south?  what the heck are ya saying brother?   splashhopper
206839,MJL,2008-05-27 02:20:00,2427,"  When we get a run, our alarms do this   The little dangly thing in the vid is a hanger.  In the case a hooked fish swims towards you, the hanger/swinger will drop thus providing enough tension for the line to continue running over the bite alarm.  Hangers/Swingers are visual indicators.  MEANING:  you can watch when they rise and dip to tell if something is playing with your bait before they actually hook themselves."
206847,splashhopper,2008-05-27 02:29:00,2931,"so until i can get all rigged up like a delta fighter from the US army, can i just use a tippet light for my rod at night?"
206855,Victor,2008-05-27 02:32:00,1609,"that works, some people uses a bell as sound indicator .... but when the wind picks up it's alittle tough with the bell. I have also seen people hang a bobber on the line in between two of the rod guides ... it acts somewhat like a hanger. The light weight of the bobber will pull the line downwards due to gravity and when a fish takes line out the bobber will move"
206856,Victor,2008-05-27 02:35:00,1609,"o yeah. All the equipment is not neccessary at all ... you catch fish with way more expensive gear but you can also do the same using dirt cheap stuff. Just make sure you watch your rod, loosen the drag so your rod won't fly out when a carp takes it... i have seen it happen so many times already lol."
206858,MJL,2008-05-27 02:37:00,2427," You certainly can.  Most of the time when a carp takes the bait and gets hooked, they run like a demon possessed.  You'll probably hear your drag going before you turn around to see your rod tip doubled over"
206859,splashhopper,2008-05-27 02:44:00,2931,"  i think iwas getting a ""little excited"" with the hits tonight as i had my little girl with me and I really wanted to get one on the line for her try and bring in...  I kept trying to set the hook like it was a rainbow.... too quick on the draw i think ?  the two i got on though did just as u both said, grabbed the bait and raaaannnnnnn!  lol  i am gonna try again on Wednesday and friday night for a few hours.  right now i am just using bread balls and am getting lots of hits... no corn balls yet,,, might try ""spam"" too! lol  any thoughts for these Lake Erie trib carp ?"
206871,MJL,2008-05-27 03:01:00,2427," Pretty much carp will take anything edible.  I've caught carp on (in no particular order) canned corn, maize, bread, doughbaits (various recipes), worms, roe, chick peas, maple peas, boilies (in various flavours), peanuts, corn pops or puffs (can't remember the cereal), rubber corn, jumbo corn, carp pellets + other baits I can't remember.  With meaty or fishy baits, you usually end up getting a lot of bullheads or channel cats instead.  Carp will take Spam...It's actually what a lot of anglers in the UK and Europe use"
206898,wolfville,2008-05-27 04:37:00,396,"Bite alarms are not necessary for carp fishing to many people, but man am I addicted to the sound it makes ......"
206899,BFSC Kevin,2008-05-27 04:48:00,1351,.. lol wrong!! i REAALLY don\t like the looks of mirror carps...
206952,Victor,2008-05-27 11:48:00,1609," If you're using a hair rig, you pretty much don't need to set the hook. It should embed itself into the carp's mouth when it takes the bait and run, when you pick up your rod and set the drag back to normal, that tension should be enough to get the hook in. They have soft mouths and if you set it too hard it will just rip it and yank the hook out. Let us know how you make out!"
206996,Beans,2008-05-27 13:44:00,3339, Amen to that!!!...Sweet music to the ears!
214623,pikemaster66,2008-06-12 17:15:00,6,Nice fish. thats a good fishing trip by anyones standards
203824,Victor,2008-05-20 18:35:00,1609,"On Friday night, MJL, Wolfville and I decided to head out east for some carp fishing. It's been a while since we have fished and chilled at the bankside together. MJL and I got to the swim at around 9pm, wolfville has already dropped his rig into the water and had a line bump while we were setting up ... seemed like a good sign.  In the next 6 hours or so, it's pretty much Wolfville-the-old-man showing us how to catch a carp and the young boys taking the role of netboy and camera man.   I'll let the pics do the talking ...  First few of the night ...      MJL figured that he doesn't want to be outfished and lands his first of the night   Wolfville quickly responses and lands this one   Just when MJL and I think wolfville has landed his fair share of fish ... he brings this in ...   His new PB @ 29lbs and 35in, here's another look after he cleans her up   After releasing that fish, wolfville has decided that he has landed enough and he should probably be a good husband and head home. Originally MJL and I had plans to head up to peterborough for more carp action, however I was too tired to drive and action stayed somewhat consistent so we opt to stay.  Shortly after wolfville took off, MJL brought this one in...   Up till this point, i haven't had much of a line bump or a hit while the other two guys has gotten bumps consistently. At exactly 4am, the sweet sound of my alarm finally came on. You would have no idea how excited I was ... after a decent fight my first carp of 2008 was netted.  yeah i'm in pretty bad shape after waking up at 6am the earlier morning for work and having to soldier out the cold This fish was honoured to be my first of 08. He was so excited that he left some of its milt on MJL's net.  It seemed that the fish has started to feed more all of a sudden and MJL landed this one not long after   Everything died off after that, but the two of us got a chance for a quick nap. At 6:45am, we had a double header but MJL's fish took him into some snags and got loose. In a way it worked out better because my net was still in the car and his net was really far from me.   Moments later a nice suprise came for MJL, an absolutely stunning mirror carp.   This fish deserves a close up  I don't think anyone would call this one ugly eh?  As the sun came up rain started to come down and action completely stopped, we left at around 11 30am. All in all, wolfville landed 6-7, MJL landed 8 and I landed 2. They're all in the 12-20lb range with the except of wolfville's big girl. It was loads of fun and we gotta do it again sometime soon."
203836,ccmtcanada,2008-05-20 18:44:00,7971,"Wow...you guys had a great night/morning out there!  Congrats on a successful outing.  That mirror carp is quite the specimen!!  I wouldn't go as far as say it was nice looking, but it's a hell of a lot less ugly....LOL."
203844,fatherof3,2008-05-20 18:52:00,1769,"great report,would say you guys had a very good trip"
203846,Rich,2008-05-20 18:54:00,3927,"Wow, awesome stuff! Has Wolfville extended my invite to you guys yet? You're all welcome to get the heck down here for some big carp and different scenery. 29lbs - at my spot you can beat that!  Awesome stuff though. I often wondered about carp fishing at night. I've done it a few times with limited success. Guess I shouldn't pack the corn away after dark so soon anymore.  Next time you round up the boys, head down this way though, seriously - before they're gone!"
203849,wolfville,2008-05-20 18:58:00,396,"Thanks Victor... not trying to be a good husband/father... just didn't want to extend the lead too much ;-)  Thanks for the report, it was fun and we should do it again SOON."
203891,shane,2008-05-20 20:01:00,652,
203911,mattyk,2008-05-20 20:18:00,2110,some nice looking carp!
203916,tibbs,2008-05-20 20:21:00,650,Nice Job!!!  Looks like you had a blast with MJL and Wolfville.
203921,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-20 20:24:00,3761,"Man, you love to fish for carp. looks like those HUGE fish would give you a heck of a fight. congrads on the many fish"
203951,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-20 21:20:00,0,Great report. Sounds like you guys had a great time with a lot of scrappy carp! Looks really cold. You guys are 2 hardcore fisherman!
203979,ehg,2008-05-20 21:48:00,2666," You rarely see a mirror carp caught. Nice picture of it. Great report and write up.  Thanks for sharing, ehg"
204002,007,2008-05-20 22:31:00,537,Good job guys.  That's a nice haul for a night's fishing.  Congrats to all three of you for sticking at it - you look freezing.  Congrats to MJL on a 'rare' Ontario Mirror Carp.  007
204025,scuro,2008-05-20 23:06:00,386,YOu buddy are hardcore...surprised you napped at briefly just before sunrise. Lots of nice big fish! Far better then looking at those welterweight bows and walleye on the other weekend reports.
204047,MJL,2008-05-20 23:46:00,2427,"Great report Victor...I'm guessing we'll be doing something similar on Saturday at the carping g2g  Moment of the night was when CCMT and Bly came by for a quick visit. Bly described a log which couldn't be seen in the dark close to the far bank.  Bly ""There's a log over there that is excellent for holding fish"" MJL ""That's not good, I casted over there"" Bly ""That's great, that log holds fish underneath it"" MJL ""No, I mean I think I casted over it [the log]""  I finally got to Christen my new carp rod/baitrunner combo...A graduation present I got for myself.  We gotta do it again sometime this year. Road trip anyone?"
204057,sharper,2008-05-20 23:54:00,279,Nice report and pics!
204059,Moosebunk,2008-05-20 23:55:00,3970,Hey that's a load of crap!!!
204061,Moosebunk,2008-05-20 23:56:00,3970,"Ooops typo above... I mean ""carp."""
204089,Crazyhook,2008-05-21 00:37:00,1154,nice work guys! that is it I am going to the river!
204227,Victor,2008-05-21 11:04:00,1609,Thanks everyone!   Thanks for the invite Rich. We gotta figure out a time and take you up on that offer!
204232,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-21 11:22:00,1362,Nice fish guys!!
204260,dsn,2008-05-21 12:32:00,1018,"Wow, what an awesome report Victor . And it does look cold out there too. You guys should bring a tent next time and set it up to nap in and block the wind.  And why does MJL always get the mirror? I have seen mirrors but have yet to land one.   dsn"
204279,jediangler,2008-05-21 13:17:00,1923,"Great report Victor. Congrats on the 35""er Wolfville. MJL that certainly is a pretty carp. I haven't seen any mirrors in the Grand in my area. Did you ever catch any Victor last year when you where in Waterloo?"
204280,Victor,2008-05-21 13:23:00,1609," I haven't caught my first mirror ... definitely looking forward to that though. From what I heard from others, it seems that the lower Grand has alot of them."
204288,fishnsled,2008-05-21 13:43:00,3520,NICE fish and a great report.  That mirror carp looks pretty cool.  I'd never would have thought this until a couple of weeks ago when I got my first carp but....... I'm jealous......
204291,ccmtcanada,2008-05-21 13:54:00,7971, LOL
