Wouldn't charge. Went back to CT and got the Nautilus and it not only charges faster, but works like a charm. So if you guys wanna buy chargers? Dont be cheap. Invest in a good one! $100+  It says keep out of the rain, so I guess its not an onboard charger?Or does an on board charger also have to be hidden from the elements? I thought they were water proof, or is this just reffering to when it is charging?"
213756,jwl,2008-06-10 19:10:00,1056,"good to hear ya got it worked out..i have a nautalis charger too...works great, batteriews also nautalis..starting/cranking battery still great, deepcycle still charges good, both batteries 5 years old and going strong...the charger is a good charger, set it on auto and charge it up in the garage...I do this every time I pretty much drain my battery on the Minkotta when the testbutton says recharge."
213757,Victor,2008-06-10 19:10:00,1609,"What charger did you have before Johnny Bass?  I just bought the motomaster that was on sale for $69.99 at CTC on Sunday ... i think there are problems with my battery itself so i don't know if there's any issues with the charger ...  Now that I think of it, maybe I should just buy the onboard charger at Basspro for $99.99 ... it can charge both my cranking and deep cycle at the same time ..."
213758,misfish,2008-06-10 19:11:00,29133,"Johhny,it would say if it was an onboard. Most of the on boards that I have seen are water proof. Glad to hear all worked out for ya."
213762,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-10 19:18:00,0," I think it was the Eliminator or something like that. Bring it back and get the Nautilus or the onboard charger at BPS. They also charge the battery a lot quicker. Save you time and money.  I guess its not an onboard charger then Brian. But its got water on the package and with the words Nautilus, you'd think its water proof! Oh well.  But its got a 5 year warranty!!!"
213765,misfish,2008-06-10 19:23:00,29133,Nautilus what John???????? Make model?
213795,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-10 19:55:00,0,Model CT-1500A??? And I think it is made by motomaster. Nautilus. Apparently someone tiold me they come with a deionizing button(or something like that) But I guess this model doesn't
213804,Garry2Rs,2008-06-10 20:06:00,1425,"""Nautilus"" was the name of Capt. Nemo's submarine in the Julies Verne science fiction classic 20,00 Leagues Under the Sea. Do you suppose that this charger is also a submarine?.  It has the same name..."
213808,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-10 20:10:00,0, I assumed it was at least water proof like one!lol
213813,Garry2Rs,2008-06-10 20:21:00,1425,"This is also the name chosen by the US Navy for the first atomic powered submarine...If it glows in the dark, cover you balls when you use it!"
213817,misfish,2008-06-10 20:24:00,29133,"Found this John  Question Water proof? Is this unit water proof? asked 9 months ago by wrapper - Quebec on Motomaster Nautilus Intelligent Battery Charger1 answerAnswers answer 1 No, this unit is not water proof."
213820,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-10 20:28:00,0," I figured that much, with the big holes in the side and the wires exposed. Why they have water on the package as if it is a marine type charger, I don't know.  But an onboard battery charger is. Correct?  Either way, for now I am pleased with my purchase and the amount of time it took to charge the battery."
213868,Guest lundboy,2008-06-10 22:17:00,0,"You got the good charger... it's actually made by Schumacher, one of the best charger makers going....  http://store.schumachermart.com/battery-chargers-marine.html  It is a marine type charger, in that it is a deep cycle charger and also has AGM settings. It's classified as a portable charger. An on-board will have mounting holes on the case, and will be fully waterproof.  The Nautilus is not waterproof or even water resistant.... so keep it dry."
213876,Billy Bob,2008-06-10 22:34:00,5865,May I recommend a very good on-board charger that is waterproff and has performed without a problem.  Now I have had this charger for about 5 or 6 years. READ the info on it and remember Cabela's name is on it so they will stand behind it. Here it is http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...600056&rid=
214128,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-11 12:46:00,0,"Thanks guys! Bob, when this one breaks down I will definately buy an onboard charger and consider Cabela's."
214199,Tybo,2008-06-11 16:43:00,1373,"The nautilus case is made of plastic. If the charger shorts, you don't have to worry about getting electrocuted when you touch your boat."
