214462,jwl,2008-06-12 04:02:00,1056,"right on , some great big kid toys...either they really love ya or else they are trying to get rid of ya by sending ya out fishing more   You guys ever kinda notice though when it come to Father's Day it always turns out a bit different than ..Mother's Day???...for example, Mother's day...presents or what not aside, There's advertized ""Mother's day "" brunch things all over the place, restaurants with fancy dinner menus ect...and what do we do...we take our wives or mom's out for a nice expensive meal, or we may even go out of our way to cook up a nice dinner to show  our appreciation for some of the special ladie's in our lives.   Father's day on the other hand....someone, some where along the lines decided this was a good day for a BBQ to be the tradition.....then what do we get...adds in the flyers with a buck off a T-Bone for a ""father's day"" special, and when all is said and done...what winds up happening  .....we get shafted into to cooking our own dinner, and a bunch of other people's too"
