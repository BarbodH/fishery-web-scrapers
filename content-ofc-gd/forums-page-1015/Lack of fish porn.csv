214016,msp,2008-06-11 02:25:00,1336,"Hey guys, Im very dissappointed about the lack of fish porn lately. Its June 10 already!!!!!!!!!!! Gimme the goods guys, Im starting to jones. I dont want to be a hypocrite so I will try to do my part. Heres one of the smaller trout that my buddy Frank caught this year on an eastern trib. Please keep in mind that Frank is 6 foot 6 and 265 pounds. You guys can do the math and then argue about how much this fish weighs. See you guys next week with more fish porn."
214039,johnl,2008-06-11 03:15:00,197,Here's one i got on the opener.IMG]http://i277.photobucket.com/albums/kk42/johnl2008/000_0020.jpg[/img]
214041,johnl,2008-06-11 03:17:00,197,I'll get the hang of this i swear
214045,Greencoachdog,2008-06-11 03:21:00,8163,Sounds like you're already trolling msp!  Show us one you caught!
214047,johnl,2008-06-11 03:34:00,197,and a small brown from last year
214095,Victor,2008-06-11 11:36:00,1609,"that's a real small one indeed lol. Nice fish, thanks for sharing with us.  We did get some fish porn since muskie opened and we've got quite a number of muskie anglers here ... don't worry though, give it another 2 weeks, once bass opens ... you'll see alot more.  I just haven't caught much to report for the last 2-3 weeks lol ..."
214112,lew,2008-06-11 11:54:00,12767," You also need to understand that many of us on this board don't find it necessary to weigh, measure,  photograph and post pictures of every fish we catch, but will still often post a written report of our catches."
214118,tdotfisherman,2008-06-11 12:10:00,317,And I thought the 12 pound Steelhead I caught earlier this year was huge.. your buddy's fish is just off the charts..
214121,Greencoachdog,2008-06-11 12:20:00,8163," I wouldn't pay any mind to this guy Lew, you've posted your fair share of pics and we appreciate it!!!  msp has only posted 2 pics, one that looks pretty old and without a date that may or may not be him... and the other of a ""friend"" that was taken 2 months ago.  Maybe we'll start paying attention to him when he starts posting recent catch pics of his own... or not.  If he's that disappointed, he should do his part to help out the community!"
214156,Reef Runner,2008-06-11 14:40:00,981,"I'd love to help...but won't get out until after my exam.  Went out once last month to sctratch that itch and reported on the experience.  Expect more from me in about three weeks.  Lew, as always, brings up a good point.  I don't measure and photograph all the fish I catch.  If I catch 5 pike, my method is to photograph one that seems like the average size amongst all for my post.  But if its worthy of a photo, for colours or size, or a tourney entry...it's time for your close up fishy!  reefrunner"
214169,msp,2008-06-11 14:59:00,1336,"I have lots of porn for you, Green coachdog.Dont hold your breath, but I have some kick ass reports from the last Four weeks coming soon!!!!!!! I may have only posted two pictures so far and am considered a ""newbie""but I think that my upcoming posts will get me some respect.  P.S. I might be too good looking to post some of the fish that I caught."
214179,Victor,2008-06-11 15:32:00,1609,"  looking forward to that. Please, make sure that you have your shirt ON in the pics.   haha"
214196,Greencoachdog,2008-06-11 16:35:00,8163,"  Are you gonna Bull us to death, or are you gonna show us the money (shots)???"
214201,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-06-11 16:44:00,160,"Ok is this guy going to post his picts anytime soon??  well this might not be much, but here is one of mine "
214239,Greencoachdog,2008-06-11 18:30:00,8163," If fish pics is all you want to see, then go here:  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showforum=41  All more recent than the pic you posted.  Anybody can grab pics off the web or from friends, but it takes REAL effort to go out and CPR them yourself!!! Then you may or may not want to edit them, then upload them to a host, then post them to the board... and you might as well write a few words while you're doing that..."
214256,MuskieWannabe,2008-06-11 19:16:00,79,Here's my opener catch...
