213235,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-09 21:32:00,2050,"Well another weekend has come and gone, and with all the house renovations I've got going on I'm only able to sneak out from 5 a.m to about 10 a.m.  After seeing some quality carp reports I decided to put the little pontoon aside and hit my carp ""swim"" for the first time this season.  The morning started off just right, slept well, up before the alarm and out the door to watch the sun rise on my way down the road....   The mosquito's were ferocious, but I was stoked to make my way through the bush, down to my perfect little carp spot.  It's barely 5 minutes from my doorstep and always produces a good half dozen or more carp, even on short outings.  The second I cleared the bushes I was shocked to see a net strung across the creek. There was dead and struggling carp the whole way across.  Some had no tails left but were still gasping for air.....       I don't know if the ministry would do something like this as some sort of carp control but it seems like a cruel way to do it.  It's not like they were taking over the area, and even if they were, this creek dumps into Erie which has plenty more carp who'll run up-stream.  Anyways, I fished the area for a short while and didn't even get a tap.  On Saturday my new Humminbird 141c came in the mail.  I had to rip the cupboards out of the kitchen as promised to the fiance, but the second that was done I was in the garage installing it onto the personal pontoon boat...I was excited to test out the humminbird, and am also anxious for bass season so the game plan was to find suspended panfish near deeper weedlines and get them on crank baits.  Like fishing for tiny bass...  It wasn't long before I marked some fish and started piking them off with a perch pattered micro Rapala.   Most fish were caught in around 8 to 10 FOW right off the weed edge...the wind was howling so staying in the right area was a bit of a pain....I think I'll be buying a wind sock soon.  Water was 70 degrees and the big bluegill were guarding their nests in about 2 FOW.  Kept 1 gill just to add a little more meat to the table but left the other bigguns alone for genetic stock.    Dinner - Gotta get my Omega 3's for the week Snag....   Ended the weekend off with the family down at my own private little lake in the backyard...it's almost finished   Good luck out there UF"
213238,Burtess,2008-06-09 21:38:00,901,Thats a good assortment of panfish for a fishfry for sure!  Did you remove the net?  I would report that to the local MNR office and send your pics too.  Burt
213250,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-09 21:56:00,0,"Definately report this to the MNR. If it is them, thats fine but if its poachers, thats a no no!!!  And that micro perch actually catches fish?? I bought it and after using it and realizing I cant cast more than 10 feet with it and paid more than $8 for it I felt ripped off!!!Maybe I will give it a try some day when I am bored and want to target panfish!!  Thanks for the Report!"
213283,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-09 23:01:00,2050," I'm hoping somebody from around the long point area know's somebody from the MNR on here...otherwise I'll just look it up.  And yeah that little perch works great.  It's best used as more of a search bait, strolled behind the boat...once you get 1 you can switch it up to a float and micro tube or trout worm and destroy them.....but I'm sick of float fishing so I stuck it out with the crank and got my first two crappie of the season.  When strolling I find the mini floating rap has better action, but when casting this one is better because it sinks...so if the fish are in 5 to 8 FOW you can let is sink before retrieving...  cheers, UF"
213287,Joey,2008-06-09 23:09:00,9122,"Maybe its a native hunting net, that's a possibility.  Looks like a nice place to be, great looking panfish too.  Joey"
213288,ccmtcanada,2008-06-09 23:11:00,7971,"Fantastic report UF!  That net seems a bit suspicious to me, but then again, what do I know?  LOL.  Great assortment of panfish there...hope they made a nice snack for you!  Love that last shot of the family down at the ""dock"".....you going to stock that pond?? hehe."
213416,Rich,2008-06-10 02:10:00,3927,I'd like to find the arse who strung that net across there! There's a heck of a lot more than carp that run that creek. If it was the MNR - BAD SHOW!!!!  Nice work on the pannies though.
213430,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-10 02:29:00,2050," yeah man, I've caught everything there, bass, pike, pannies, catfish, carp, trout, bowfin you name it.....I'll look into it at some point tomorrow and see if I can come up with any info...."
213525,Victor,2008-06-10 11:30:00,1609,"That's a real shame with that net ...  Looks like all the gills you've been catching are all in good size, i rarely get one that big. Congrats on the add-on to your setup!"
213585,snag,2008-06-10 13:58:00,1932,That's a shocking discovery for sure.  Great report as always.  Now get back to work
213588,wolfville,2008-06-10 14:09:00,396,"Are people really that hungry to set a net like that? or just too stupid. Thanks for sharing the info. Please report that to MNR,  the toll free number 1-877-TIPS MNR (http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_166027.html) should work from your area too."
213601,fishnsled,2008-06-10 14:41:00,3520,"Thanks for the report UF. Some nice fish there too.  As Wolfville said, pick up the phone and call will ya!  I would like to know what the result is of the phone call.  Keep us updated bud."
213622,Mike Pike,2008-06-10 15:24:00,1332,Great report and pics!  And a very nice little haul of pan fishies for the fry pan!
213690,ccmtcanada,2008-06-10 17:43:00,7971, Will is becoming a carp activist....
214286,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-11 20:44:00,2050,"Quick update for those who were asking - My local CO phoned me back tonight about the net and nobody has any permits to be down there of any sort, so he's heading down to rip out the net tonight....if the owner hasn't already claimed it.  cheers, UF"

214374,BabyHerc,2008-06-12 01:05:00,285, A 7 foot ultralight rod with 4 lb test will cast that thing a mile.
214417,Mike the Pike,2008-06-12 02:17:00,3421,Excellent report UB nice pics
214420,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-12 02:26:00,2050," yeah man, I was only tossing it on a 5'5""UL with 8lb braid (equal to 1lb mono I believe) and a 4lb fluoro leader and could zing it as far as any big pike bait.  It's actually pretty heavy for a tiny bait.  That reservoir has bow's and brown's in it so I'm betting the trout patterned one would do well also.  Cheers"
