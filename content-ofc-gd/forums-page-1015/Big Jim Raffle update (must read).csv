Since compiling and posting the prize list we have had many generous donations to add to the list.  So many in fact that we have enough to add another prize!!  That's right a 5th draw prize!  And as with the others it will be headlined by a muskie charter, generously donated from Figure 8 muskie charters out of the Kawarthas.  So if you haven't bought your tickets yet, do it now to get in on over $6500.00 worth of awesome prizes.  I'll be posting a list of the prizes for the 5th draw soon.  Cheers  Matt"
