Tried Island Lake and only caught small ones,  I was thinking of Bellwood Lake their web site says trophy size pike??? Has anybody fished there???  Think I'll try it saturday anyway..  If anyone has any suggestions. I'm trying to stay close to the GTA"

214138,Buzz Bait,2008-06-11 13:30:00,4," I had the video camera running, my buddy caught the fish. actually he caught a smaller pike and as he was reeling it in the 40 incher (38 incher to be exact). grabbed a hold of it and we netted the 2 fish at once  we posted the video on YOU TUBE here's the link http://youtube.com/watch?v=wpx16rjE87c  check it out.."
214197,pokerdemon4,2008-06-11 16:38:00,135,A 40incher from mountsberg.  WOW.  Thats a nice one.
214205,jwl,2008-06-11 16:54:00,1056,"searching for really big pike is almost along the lines of big musky hunting..although you are more likely to catch a bunch of small pike in the quest than you are gonna catch a bunch of little muskies in the search.  In the hot summer months the big ones are probably few and far between, probably have better luck in the late fall...last year all the biggest pike I caught where in like January."
214211,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-11 17:27:00,2585,that is one big pike for mountsburg!  if you want big pike try the t.o islands.  cheers!
