214431,moose72,2008-06-12 02:53:00,28,Can anyone tell me where the best place to mount the transducer for a bow fishfinder is? Can I mount it to the trolling motor ?
214447,Sinker,2008-06-12 03:37:00,8692,"Yup, the trolling motor is the best spot.  You can just use a hose clamp and clamp it on the motor housing. Just watch the wire running down the shaft.....I found it to be a PITA.  Sinker"
214449,moose72,2008-06-12 03:38:00,28,thanks for the help Sinker
214454,jediangler,2008-06-12 03:46:00,1923,Eagle makes a kit for putting a transducer on the bottom of your trolling motor. Here is a pic of one on my transom trolling motor. I don't think it would be any different up front. 
214457,moose72,2008-06-12 03:51:00,28,Thats exactly what I had in mind. Thanks for the pic
