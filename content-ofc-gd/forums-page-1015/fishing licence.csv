214599,xrap,2008-06-12 16:55:00,683,I remember there being a topic  about this but I can't find it. Recently my cousin came from Poland  for a 2 month visit. He would like to go fishing with us. Does he need to purchase a fishing licence?

214615,Reef Runner,2008-06-12 17:11:00,981,"Yes, it may be more expensive because he is non-resident."
214617,mikethespike,2008-06-12 17:13:00,51,"yes he is required to have a license:  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_165323.html  fees here:  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsF...L02_165336.html  they just introduced the 8-day license for ontario, last year my mother (visiting from florida) had to get the 1 year non-resident license to go fishing for 2 days  hope this helps."
