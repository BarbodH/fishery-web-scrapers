212854,danbouck,2008-06-09 01:21:00,4380,Banana was the problem guaranteed!
212856,Tinman,2008-06-09 01:26:00,376,Banana in the tail pipe
212878,bassfighter,2008-06-09 02:16:00,366,"Only way to know is to use a test meter, check if it is the battery or charging system, if nothing wrong , check the color of spark plug, is it burning properly, if not replace it and try again. It could be one of the coil or could be one of the power pack.  Good luck"
212881,Mike the Pike,2008-06-09 02:24:00,3421,Does your boat have a built in gas tank or a five gallon tank.  Some of my previous boats had an air vent valve at the top of the fill cap if the air pressure is not released this can cause the engine to stall  the tank should be well vented when out on the water or your engine could perform like you have described.  Enjoy fishin with your son
212917,SlowPoke,2008-06-09 04:47:00,2984,"It sounds like a bad connection causing an intermittent problem. -was the main motor charging the battery during the ""ran it hard for an hour"" part? -does your key have to be on for the trim switch to work? If so, it may be a bad key switch. -possible bad stator depending on the high RPM cut-in for charging - I think it would be lower than 4000 RPM and probably wouldn't cause the trim to fail. -try tracing the power wire from the trim solenoid back to the source of power looking for bad connections or deteriorated wiring. ... or it could be the banana. -Brian"

214062,workwear,2008-06-11 04:17:00,592,thanks to everyone who responed......check out all the wiring on the motor and found no loose wires.....   was wondering if there is a diagnostics i can do.......would like to avoid the shop at all costs....
214064,sharper,2008-06-11 04:22:00,279,Isn't having a banana on a boat bad luck?
214137,davew3,2008-06-11 13:22:00,430,Sounds more like a fuel issue.  I would check all fuel lines and filters.  if you have an electronic fuel pump I would get it checked out as well. Maybe a little dirt that cleaned itself out . Good luck
214161,SlowPoke,2008-06-11 14:44:00,2984,And how would that cause the motor trim function to fail?
214171,muskymatt,2008-06-11 15:04:00,2608,Bananas are a slippery subject when it comes to boating.....  Leave your bananas on shore...lol 
214186,Clampet,2008-06-11 15:58:00,1947,What Mike said.  That sounds like it is starving for air.
214193,Reef Runner,2008-06-11 16:26:00,981,"It sounds like it starving for air, true, but that wouldnt explain the trim not functioning.  I would say its electrical, alternator dying on ya  , but just a logical guess based on the info you gave us.  ..or it was the banana.lol  Good looking lure musky matt, when's monkey season open up?  lol"
