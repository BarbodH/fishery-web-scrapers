Fished a couple hours with only a follow until a slender toothed esox grabbed the line, after a nice fight she was in my greedy little hands.        All in all it was a great night out, had lots of fun and thats the idea right?  The picture series is about 40 pics from the hookset right up to the release, Lisa has never seen a pike before and got a little trigger happy with the camera!  tightlines all"
