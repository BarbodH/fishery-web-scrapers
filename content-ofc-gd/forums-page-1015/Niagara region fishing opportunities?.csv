214476,Jonaton,2008-06-12 06:39:00,72,So next Saturday I will be heading out to the Niagara area and will have about 8 hours to kill and was hoping to wet a line. My friend and I have a boat but have no idea where to go or what species to target. I believe parts of the Niagara are fishable by boat but am unsure where to lauch from. Is there anywhere else in the general region that is accessible by boat or shore?. We do not have downriggers or equiptment for deep water trolling.  Any tips at all would help .  Thanks in advance Jonaton
