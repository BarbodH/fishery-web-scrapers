214432,Mike the Pike,2008-06-12 02:55:00,3421,  Now that was funny thanks for the laugh
214440,F7Firecat,2008-06-12 03:08:00,347,"You know guys its like I said it not the money thing of how much they cost its the ethics thing.  LOL  Im getting a huge laugh at you guys, alright for me to get bashed but please do not bash a fellow OFNER with a couple thosuand posts. Give it up.  I knew when I posted this that this is the type of reaction you guys would give me, and I just fueled the fire. Just goes to show what type of people are here. Its the good ole boys club!  LOL  please bash me somemore Im loving it"
214441,danbo,2008-06-12 03:12:00,2646,Bud..the jokes is you! Go back to your lawn bowling forum..
214442,Whopper,2008-06-12 03:15:00,2174,"Had two guys try to take one of mine on the West Arm last year while I was fishing around it.  I politely asked them in a loud tone of voice what the heck do you think your doing???  I wouldn't leave mine out over night either, always pick them up when I'm done, hey but that's just me. Didn't realize I was in a new club"
214444,Sinker,2008-06-12 03:33:00,8692,Maybe we need to do a new poll.  Do you leave your marker buoys out all night? Yes or no......  I'd bet the majority would be a big no.  I have a funny feeling you might be the only yes.......common sense ain't so common these days!!   Sinker
214446,danbo,2008-06-12 03:35:00,2646,Mabe we need to just ignore TROLLS..
214477,POLLIWOGG,2008-06-12 06:42:00,835,"A small marker left unattended  could easily be considered a hazard to navigation , they're not that easy to see in the day. Learn how to use ranges and you don't need a marker or a gps."
214482,Jer,2008-06-12 10:44:00,1426,I have to agree with the general concensus... Why would you leave markers out unattended?...talk about a safety hazard!
214519,holdfast,2008-06-12 12:34:00,1813," Hey thanks for the post, this is really entertaining watching all the tough guys come out of the woodwork.  I see how you feel about losing personal property.  Funny the markers never got touched until Sunday.  I bet its in the city right now.  Personally, I think there is enough private property along the shoreline, let alone floating!"
214531,Spiel,2008-06-12 12:50:00,9065,"....Well we're going in cirlces now and my heads spinning.  Lesson learned, don't leave marker buoys unattended it may be costly in more ways than one!"
214003,johnnyb,2008-06-11 02:01:00,3413,"pleasure boater on the pool --- LOL!  We have just achieved ""on fire"" status....nice!  I hope you are feeling a bit better, F7Firecat....it was a dumb thing that happened...but it's a dumb world we live in"
214017,forrest,2008-06-11 02:26:00,1032,they are not lobster traps.  At $5 a piece they are your gold but someone else's garbage.
214019,steverowbotham,2008-06-11 02:32:00,1800,"I agree that marker buoys are for temporary use.  I always pic kthem up when I'm done.  I have a GPS and 5 marker buoys.  If I saw one out there with no one around, I would have 6 marker buoys."
214027,BillM,2008-06-11 02:48:00,17367,"Doctrt: That's why you should park the truck against the trees, away from the ramp at the Maclean Lake launch.   You should see some of the people that 'try' and launch a boat there,  it's horrific."

214060,Greencoachdog,2008-06-11 04:09:00,8163,"  Yeah, that's the main problem with tillers... you can't see where you're going.   In a perfect world, those markers should have set there all season... but guess what?"
214092,Chris,2008-06-11 11:33:00,405,"There's an old saying. Finders keepers, losers weepers. No offence but if you leave your stuff out there unattended in this day and age, you should expect it to be gone."

214237,RangerGuy,2008-06-11 18:26:00,564,Shouldn't leave those little marker bouys for fishing over night anyways.. not on any lake especially one as busy as Gloucester Pool. For 2 reasons  1) YOUR GIVING YOUR SPOTS AWAY LOL! (Sorry couldn't help it)  2) It could get caught in somebody's prop and do damage OR a animal could get caught up in it.   I would tend to think someone trolling snagged it. I wouldn't throw it back in if I snagged it either I'd keep it.  Sorry man.. just my 2 cents
214241,Stoty,2008-06-11 18:34:00,2910, Totally agree!
214243,cram,2008-06-11 18:38:00,1733,"Anyone who leaves them out overnight (or when their boat is off the water), especially on Gloucester pool, deserves to lose them."
214248,Kirk,2008-06-11 18:49:00,347,"Leaving them out overnight sort of implies you own the lake...them disappearing is gods way of letting you know its a public lake.  I find marker buoys helpful, I have loads of them, didn't know people bought them...LOL"

214294,Sinker,2008-06-11 21:20:00,8692, As you should if no one is around........
214296,ehg,2008-06-11 21:24:00,2666,What kinda dumbdonkey leaves marker bouys at a fishing spot? I knew to take them when i left a fishing spot when i was 12 yrs. old. This thread should be locked based on stupidity.

214320,oncogene,2008-06-11 22:13:00,154,i duno... u left something out in a public area for 2 days.... shouldn't be surprised it's gone  The person(s) who took it may think s/he's doing a good thing by taking away the junk that somebody was too lazy to remove after fishing.... who knows.
214323,Gerritt,2008-06-11 22:24:00,6129,"Yeah were horse's asses because of you're serious lack of judgement...  It is always easier to blame others then to look in the mirror...  You screwed up, someone cleaned up after you.. Take you're lumps and move on..  but you are instead trying to start a riot..   Claiming theft... When infact I think that the person that did take you're markers was a Good Samaritan in my books... cleaning up the mess you left behind.  Please do me a favour.. leave a high end rod and reel in the water time.. so it is worth our while picking up after you.  G"
214340,misfish,2008-06-11 23:44:00,29133,"Maybe he was an OFC,er that wanted to share his favorite spot  Ok Im getting carried away.Thats it for me on this one.It,s been fun.   Can I lock it out??????"
213905,F7Firecat,2008-06-10 23:34:00,347,"Well I spent last weekend on the Pool for musky opener.  I threw out a few orange buoy markers, one was marking an isolated weed patch which there werent many of and one a main basin shoal shoal.  Anyway come back then next day they are still there, come back on Sunday night they are gone.  what the heck if people are that cheap that they need to take buoy markers the fishing world is in bad shape. Its not the fact that they cost 5 bucks total or so it the whole morals thing going on here.  Not to mention I was probably doing them a favour marking these two areas so they could fish.  Just need to get it off my chest!  Just hoping it wasnt an OFNER, if it was shame on you!  Bryan"
213917,bassjnkie,2008-06-10 23:43:00,1101,"That totally sucks  , but did you leave them out over night? If so, some idiots can resist free stuff.  Damn theives, Daniel OCH"
213918,smbhunter,2008-06-10 23:49:00,186,"By no means am I trying to be rude, but why would leave them in overnight? Maybe someone thought they were forgotten about and removed them, or was concerned about the line getting caught in a prop. Usually, marker buoys are only left in for short periods of time while fishing an area. Once the area is fished thoroughly, the marker is removed and the search for the next spot begins.  Or it could simply be exactly what you said, someone needed marker buoys and was too cheap to buy or make their own."
213919,purekgw,2008-06-10 23:49:00,585,happend to us before so we went out and bout a gps    and i know how you feel
213923,danc,2008-06-10 23:51:00,4677,"I wouldn't take them, but I'm not at all surprised that somebody did."

213962,solopaddler,2008-06-11 00:52:00,8605, I agree. I use markers all the time and always pick them up when I'm done fishing.
213964,BillM,2008-06-11 00:56:00,17367,Time to invest in a GPS!
213965,Gerritt,2008-06-11 00:58:00,6129,you can be upset... but I promise you if I found it wrapped around my prop... I would be PRAYING you had your name and number on it... a quick reverse lookup is all that would be required...  you're putting other people in jeopardy by leaving them out... If I would have seen them... they would have been thrown ashore.
213967,F7Firecat,2008-06-11 01:04:00,347,"Hey guys,  I got a GPS, ever try to motor up slowly with the electric to fish a small spot. The weed spot was small so I threw out markers so I could fish them the next morning bright and early, same with the mid lake shoal.  Like I said I could give a poop about the markers its the fact that there are asshats   out there who would take them, or shall I say Bottom feeders, thats what I said BOTTOMFEEDERS!    If they ended up in your prop well....... I guess you werent looking where you were going pretty typical of pleasure boaters on Gloucester though."
213974,danbo,2008-06-11 01:15:00,2646,That attitude won't win you any friends here Bud..
213976,danc,2008-06-11 01:18:00,4677,I had not thought about Gerritts point. But it's a good one. Surely you can't expect someone to be looking for marking buoys in the dark of night? A good gps can take you within 8 or 10 feet of the desired location. Marker buoys are for a temporary use.
213977,F7Firecat,2008-06-11 01:28:00,347,"Thats the way she goes, everyone is entitled to their opinion I guess."
213979,Terry,2008-06-11 01:32:00,14456,I don't know but if I come up to my favorite weed line and there is a marker bouy showing the stupid fishermen of the world where the spot is  I would remove it in a heart beat.........
213980,Doctrt,2008-06-11 01:32:00,141,"I fished Gloucester last year (parked at McLean Lake) and returned to find my front bumper had been creamed by someone.  No note, no nothing left.  Just a $600 repair bill.      I'd like to think there are a few moral fisherman left, but after hearing your story and seeing what happened to me, I may steer clear of the Pool.  T"
213982,misfish,2008-06-11 01:35:00,29133,"I AM LOL SO HARD RIGHT NOW AT THIS ONE. I came a cross one during a tourney. No one around for miles,ok 500 yards. Man what a spot. I nailed 6 fish and marked the spot on my GPS. Oh and I took the marker. Yes like G said. Not a safe thing for a prop."
