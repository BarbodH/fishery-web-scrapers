214147,dobee,2008-06-11 14:14:00,301,"I’m heading down to the Dominican at the end of July for a week and was wondering if anyone could recommend a resort or if anyone has been fishing there a  fishing charter/guide?  Not too sure what kind of fishing is best in the Dominican, hell I’ve never left Ontario lol…  Thanks so much, Joe"
214149,Reef Runner,2008-06-11 14:23:00,981,"I just came back from the Dominican and I had an awsome time.  We stayed at the Cameleon Majestic in Punta Cana, amazing place.  Didn't go on the fishing charter as the gentlemen ""trying"" to run it was a sleezeball and kept changing rates/hours/package.  He obviously didn't want to earn my business, just ween my wallet.  His loss, we had 12 potential clients.  Be wary of business practices down there.  Try the Dune buggies, best day trip EVER!!!!  reefrunner"
214154,Stoty,2008-06-11 14:37:00,2910,"I was in Punta Cana this past September and we stayed at the Melia Caribe. Beautiful resort with multiple pools (with swim up bars), 9 a la carte resturants, nightclub, casino, etc.  I agree with Reefrunner about the sleezeball people trying to get as much money out of you as they can.  Funny Story I wanted to buy my wife a little ""Punta Cana"" jewlery so I went into a shop on the beach (I had $15 US on me at the time), and found a nice bracelet/necklace set and asked how much. This dud pulled me aside and said $150 for the pair...I was like..sorry wasnt looking to spend that much...he asked how much I have on me...I said $15...he said no way, cant do it for that...then he said $75 for the pair....I said...i only have $15 on me. He then said $30 for the pair....to which I said forget it...and started to walk away...he then stopped me and said ok $15 for the pair. SOLD! He didnt own the shop, so he was trying to get $150 and give $15 to the owner and pocket the rest!"
214160,Reef Runner,2008-06-11 14:43:00,981,"LOL...typical of my experience Stoty, LOL."
214194,dobee,2008-06-11 16:28:00,301,lol.... sounds like good times! thanks for the replies guys.
214200,theRJ,2008-06-11 16:44:00,55,"As far as the fishing goes just look at the main lobby of your resort. If you booked with a large tour group, there will be a activities coordinator person in the lobby that'll set you up with a Charter for a set price. I went out for a half day for 90 bucks (shared charter with a bunch of people from other resorts) I caught the Dorado in my photo. 3 of us caught fish in one triple header. we also saw a mother Humback with calf and I say another humback do a full breach about a km away. Just make sure you bring some seasickness meds because the tradewinds leave you with 10-15ft rollers the whole time. Better safe then chucking when you should be reeling!   We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess and it was nice. My parents liked the Grand Bahia Principe better when they went a couple years ago.  RJ"
214203,steve_paul,2008-06-11 16:52:00,658,"We went out on a charter with this company in 2007, fishing was slow but he runs a good service, nice comfortable safe boat with lots of refreshments to keep you cool.  It will be smoking hot down there so the large canopy on the boat and the cold Presidente should keep you comfortable.  http://www.caribbeanoceanadventures.com/popfishing.html"
214210,highdrifter,2008-06-11 17:26:00,2534,What resort are you staying at?!  I'm sure there's reputable charter service run through your hotel.  Beware the charters run outside the resort though!!  I learned the hard way last time I was up there!  cheers HD
214214,Moosebunk,2008-06-11 17:34:00,3970,Ahhhh the Dominican.  The DUNG-HOLE of the entire Carib.  Do yourself a favor and rebook somewhere with some class.   My $.02 only.
214215,Stoty,2008-06-11 17:37:00,2910,Punta Cana is beautiful...not sure why you would say that. Bad experience maybe?  mmmmmmmmmmmm Presidente!!! Great beer! I could go for one of those right now actually!
214228,Reef Runner,2008-06-11 18:12:00,981,"PRESIDENTE!!!!!!  Man, good beer, but the drinks are so strong there, I think I was drinkin the beer to get sober.lol  I could go for one right now as well.lol"
214232,highdrifter,2008-06-11 18:16:00,2534," Good point.  The resort is guarded by gun point and your local attractions, other than the local cigar shop, will include putas and starving dogs.  If it's culture you're after... Santiago de Cuba!!  HD"
214238,Stoty,2008-06-11 18:29:00,2910,SO TRUE! hahaha
214360,Moosebunk,2008-06-12 00:36:00,3970,"Domincan leader in the early 80's decided no more money into the environment.  Ever since then, not a piece of garbage from the annual week long Mardi Gras in Peurto Plata has been picked up off the city beach.  Cruise ships won't even port there anymore.  Maybe that's why trips to the country are as cheap as Cuba... they have reason to sell at low cost because of political issues.  Mexico... they're a bargain for the simple reason it's all civil competetion to get tourists to one of their many many resort areas.  Dominican shop owners need not barter if you happen to go into the cities or towns.  Everyday people will do that for them.  And if you say no and hop on your moped to get away.... better look back and be sure no ones gunning to run you off the road just to steal the 4 bucks in your wallet.  That's how crude.  Punta Cuna I haven't been too.  I imagine it's a great looking sand dune like the many that can be found in countless other countries in the Gulf of Mexico and Central Americas.  It's all for the resort going (and staying and drinking and laying around) tourists right???  We stayed 5 star and still got off the resort everyday we were there so to get some sort of minimal touristy fill of the culture  Unimpressed.  Totally.  Sad that I hadn't instead returned to Costa Rica really.  Again, my $.02"
