How long will I use it before recharging if used at med to high, stop and go fishing...mostly for positioning the boat rather than trolling.   Will it last 10 hours running time before recharging? The 220 RC is a bit large in size for the limited space in my boat otherwise, I will get the higher rating battery."

I would just go for 180s if they are in your budget.  Don't get dual purpose, get deep cycle.  I have a 70lb 24 volt MinnKota with 2 type 27 180s:  At 70% I will get about 4hrs straight non stop trolling.  Other than that on a non-windy day with little current bass fishing, I can easily get about 2 full days fishing.  Recharge fully after every use.  At the least don't let them go more than 24 hours after using them. If you don't you will reduce the life of your batteries."

A decent deep cell battery really won't develope a ""memory"" like the batteries in rechargeable power tool for example, they are designed to slowly discharge, I just top mine up over night when needed the night before I plan on using it. Had mine since 2003"
