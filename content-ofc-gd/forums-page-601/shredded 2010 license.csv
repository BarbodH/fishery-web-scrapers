529097,Jer,2010-12-16 14:34:00,1426,I just realized I may have done a very silly thing the other day...  I received my new 3 year license and card and promptly shredded my old card just as I would an old credit card. It just occurred to me now that I might not be legal to fish now until Jan 1.
529100,Terry,2010-12-16 14:37:00,14456,http://outdoorscard.mnr.gov.on.ca/english/oc_initial.asp?tid=&s=19  chances are you can print one off here
529107,Jer,2010-12-16 14:58:00,1426,I just got off the phone with Outdoors Card services and was told my new card is valid immediately and it should not be an issue.  I hope a CO will agree.
529109,skeeter,2010-12-16 15:00:00,1907,"if you should get stopped before jan 1st, i would think after explaining it to the co, that he would check it with dispatch or just laugh at you.  if you are really worried about it then go thru the shredder, find the pieces and tape them back together.."
529112,Jer,2010-12-16 15:05:00,1426,  You would hope so...but you never know.
529118,irishfield,2010-12-16 15:22:00,26272,Yes.. your new OUTDOOR card is valid immediately as it only has an expiry date on it... BUT you no longer have a FISHING validation sticker for the 2010 season.. so they could violate you.
529120,skeeter,2010-12-16 15:28:00,1907,"did you get the name of the person you we talking to ? if not call back , go thru the same explanation and get a name. (just in case). irishfield has a valid point."
529122,ketchenany,2010-12-16 15:32:00,3229,  I'd stay home for a while
529135,Guest JPCT,2010-12-16 16:04:00,0,It's ok.  Seeing a CO is like seeing a sasquatch.
529138,Terry,2010-12-16 16:09:00,14456,As I said I just printed off a temp license for both this year and the next 3 years  to to the website and print off a temp...problem solved
529188,cwpowell,2010-12-16 18:24:00,265,"When you don't want to see them is the exact time they show up. Just like cops. When you need them, they're never around.  Should see lots on Simcoe in the first few weeks of ice!  "
529189,cwpowell,2010-12-16 18:26:00,265,I'd say if you plan to head out ice fishing before Jan 1. Check with the Ministry. Or if you want to be safe. Buy a new tag that could potentially save you a hundred and something dollar fine.
529221,Jer,2010-12-16 19:57:00,1426,  I feel violated by various government agencies everyday...
