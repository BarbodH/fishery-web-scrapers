529164,Ron,2010-12-16 17:03:00,1683,"A guy walks into a bar down in Alabama and orders a white wine. All the hillbillies sitting around the bar look up, expecting to see some pitiful Yankee from the north. The bartender says, ""You ain't from around here, are ya?"" The guy says, ""No, I'm from Wisconsin."" The bartender says, ""What do you do in Wisconsin?"" The guy says, ""I'm a taxidermist."" The bartender says,""A taxidermist? What in tarnation is a taxidermist? Do you drive a taxi?"" ""No, a taxidermist doesn't drive a taxi. I mount animals."" The bartender grins and hollers, ""It's okay boys. He's one of us. "
