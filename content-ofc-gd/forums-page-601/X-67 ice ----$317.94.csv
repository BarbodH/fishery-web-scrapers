Dejectedly I stopped at Le Baron's on the way home to see if they would come close to matching Radioworld's price.  I am a member after all.  I checked out the display and the listed sale price was $317.94.  Sold!  No more fishing in the dark.  Cheers, Mark"
529578,skeeter,2010-12-17 19:44:00,1907,$317.94 was that before or after your 10% members discount?
529582,BFSC Kevin,2010-12-17 19:54:00,1351,"according to their online catalog, it is 317.94 but it is a ""select special""... so i'm not sure if the 10% member discount will apply..."
529609,farsider,2010-12-17 20:57:00,456,"As it is already discounted, member discount is not applied.   I tried anyways at the cash...rebuffed with extreme prejudice.  Cheers,  Mark"
