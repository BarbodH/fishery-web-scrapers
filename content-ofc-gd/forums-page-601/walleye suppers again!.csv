528657,limeyangler,2010-12-15 04:27:00,5204,"Hi all,  Snuck out to the spot we hit on Sunday. No whitefish today, i did see a couple on the x67, they chased but would not commit. However, where the whitefish were scarce the walleye took up the slack. I'm gonna promise myself to re-tie my fluro leaders with the correct knot in futeure...i lost 2 monster walleye right at the hole today, one was close to 30"" for sure! bummer. Mind you i dont think i would have kept it, even though i needed just one for my limit, three keeper size is enough for the wife and me, i just would have liked the picture!  Here's the pics and vid.....i fished for exactly 2 hours, started slow but as the sun set, the fish turned on......was an awesome sunset on another chilly (-26) afternoon.                <object width=""640"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY8UMSjLu4s?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY8UMSjLu4s?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GY8UMSjLu4s?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""640"" height=""385""></embed></object>"
528660,miller,2010-12-15 04:36:00,223,"great report as usual, i must say i'm quite jealous, i cant wait to get out once its safe around here and put some fish on ice."
528661,GBW,2010-12-15 04:38:00,8460,"Simon, did I say ""I hate you"" today?  if not make a note...    Good job out there."
528668,ctranter,2010-12-15 05:03:00,543,This is one hell of a tease... nice eyes
528678,Twocoda,2010-12-15 06:13:00,4130,"yes Simon ....nice eyes....shame about the boots,coats.gloves and all that white crap around you though ...  from my hot hands holding cold drinks...to your frozen hands yearning for warm drinks... and vicariously through your lens...i applaud you"
528679,discophish,2010-12-15 06:40:00,392,Amazing take on your day Simon!  You sure are dangling a lot of carrots these days!  Were these fish shallow?  You mentioned 6fow.  I'm going to try again this year for the shallow whitefish.  I didn't have any luck with it last year.  Good luck on your next outing.  3rd time is a charm with your next big eye since you have already passed the 2nd!
528692,Rod Caster,2010-12-15 11:47:00,5784,Why Simon? Why?  You sure are maximizing your ice fishing time! I like your drive.  I use a Trilene knot sometimes for fluorocarbon...seems to hold quite well.
528699,corvette1,2010-12-15 12:53:00,1765,nice eyes simon congrats
528748,limeyangler,2010-12-15 15:39:00,5204," I'll make a mental note    Ahhh...i've seen these symptoms before, its the beginnings of a breakdown of denial, you'll be out there drilling holes soon .   Sorry Disco....i'm not in the swing of the icefishing reports just yet, your right...i'm being vague to say the least, the fish were at 20' to 25' FOW. Its a pretty much flat muddy bay....a nice drop off from the shore provides the only real 'structure', we just fished there because of being uncertain of ice thickness elsewhere on the lake, as the good spots are too far to walk out to. White jigs and tail hooked minnows were the ticket, although i did get a hit from a whitiefish on a Yum mini tube and hooked a pike on the same lure as seen in the picture.    thats the one i use too, will take the time to do it next time.   Thanks Corvy"
528764,Governator,2010-12-15 16:12:00,879,Don't forget the measureoonie lol.  Great report as usual.
528768,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-15 16:22:00,203,"Wow, very nice!!! Congratz!!!!   I must say I'm jealous haha!"
528789,Leecher,2010-12-15 17:11:00,7832,"Great report, pics and video Simon Got to love spending a couple of hours on the hard stuff and getting a limit of eyes   and that 24""er was a beaut Too bad about losing the big ones at the hole    would of been nice to see the pic of it   *cough* uni knot *cough cough*  p.s. do you always leave your pack of cigs on the ice near the hole while fishing Again great job and thanks for sharing Jacques"
528790,johnnyb,2010-12-15 17:17:00,3413,This is getting excessive!! Bordering on cruel and unusual!!! The only thing keeping me sane while watching....is that I'm hitting the ice this weekend!!! I'm working on my Limey accent...figure I gotta put as many odds in my favour for the ice-eyes
528801,lunkerbasshunter,2010-12-15 17:41:00,2585,"awesome report, pics and vids!  Cheers!"
528838,limeyangler,2010-12-15 19:52:00,5204," LOL...yeah...i thought that was funny too when i was replaying the video, just the ramblings of a guy spending too much time alone.    Not long for you guys now Smarty Pantz....looking forward to your ice reports, for someone as addicted to fishing as you(a very healthy addiction i might add) i imagine they are gonna be good.    I didn't get my limit in the end Jacques,left with a 17"" and two small ones...enuff for a feed. As for the ciggy pack, it wasn't there when i left...thats for sure!    Where ya goin JB? i think you already told us all but my brain has frost bite."
528847,johnnyb,2010-12-15 20:45:00,3413,"Going to Nosbonsing....got a room booked and bringing the wife and baby girl   I'll go out for the morning bite, come back for lunch, then we'll all head out and give it a go...going with a bunch of friends so there will be heated shelters, and plenty of helping hands.

Anyhoo...tight lines this weekend!     JD.....its not intentional(well maybe i do get a little kick out of it...hehe) but i know how it is waiting for the ice as long as we did this year....soon friend...soon...hang in there buddy!
