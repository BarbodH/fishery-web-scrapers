528947,Bunker,2010-12-16 02:09:00,29,I thought when the bear was reaching the top he was going to kick it in the head.... that video was awsome..............
528957,GBW,2010-12-16 02:20:00,8460,"I would have asked it where it learned to climb a ladder, after I screamed like a 4 year old school girl..."
528971,Joey,2010-12-16 02:48:00,9122,"That was awesome, but I'd probably be at the top of the tree at the point where he asked him what he was doing"
529001,Twocoda,2010-12-16 03:27:00,4130,that is an awesome video...but it makes me wonder if the bear is actually a pet and they were merely playing hide and seek...
