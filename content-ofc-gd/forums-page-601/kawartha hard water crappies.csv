My not so smart son decided to go on the lake last night with his machine and hit a slushy area that threw him for a loop and rolled the machine.  This was his second ride of the year and already has repairs! I don't know if he will ever learn, but thankfully he is alive. This was in the south end out from Highview Acres.  I saw open water about 5 days ago right by the two small islands. This area freezes before the big part of the lake, so take that into consideration."
