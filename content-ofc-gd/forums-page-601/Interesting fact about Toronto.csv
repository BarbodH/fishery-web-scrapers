528938,Dave Bailey,2010-12-16 01:39:00,1641,"FACT: A ladder is the cheapest and most useless piece of equipment in any contractor's arsenal.  EVIDENCE: Every couple of days the traffic reports are warning of a ladder in the road, usually on an expressway.  THEREFORE: Obviously if they lose one they can pick another up at the nearest dollar store, if they can be bothered.  Q.E.D."
