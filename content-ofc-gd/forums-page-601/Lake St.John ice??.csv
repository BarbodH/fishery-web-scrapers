526330,cheaptackle,2010-12-07 23:46:00,849,Just a bit in some of the shallow bays (like mine on the north end).  Wouldn't care to venture out on it at all yet.  Michael
526346,misfish,2010-12-08 00:20:00,29133,"I,ll just be in the area,not venturing anywhere. But when it,s safe,i,ll be out there."
526350,tknohpy,2010-12-08 00:41:00,162,What do you catch ice fishing there?  I used to go there with my grandparents when I was young.
526365,Gerritt,2010-12-08 01:37:00,6129,"Pike, Walleye and Perch are in the lake...  Pike seem to be the dominant species.  Mmmmmm...  G"

526590,cheaptackle,2010-12-08 22:41:00,849,Ice as far as I can see this morning before I left.  Guess it skimmed over last night.  Too dark when I got in to see very far but no open water where I could see.  Doubt it's more than a skim but if it holds who knows...?  Michael
526596,misfish,2010-12-08 22:58:00,29133," Temps are not looking good for a good solid freeze up,and this snow aint helpping either."
526624,cheaptackle,2010-12-09 00:20:00,849,"Hardly any snow here and the forecast doesn't show anything above zero except for Saturday, minus 18c tonight.  May be a good thing, y'all know how fast the forecast can change.  North end of Simcoe & what I can see of Cooch seem covered as well as of this evening just before dusk.  Not that I'd trust it yet of course, but a good start if the temps cooperate.  Michael"
