529475,jimmer,2010-12-17 15:01:00,2730,Have you tried sticking those hand warmer packs down in your boots? It difficult to keep your feet warm when they're sitting in temps like that.
529478,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-17 15:05:00,0, Buy boots that have lots of room for the toes and wear two pairs of thermol socks.
529479,thebigcatch,2010-12-17 15:05:00,138,I have tried them and they don't work my feet are as cold I have very good  socks that I use for icefishing and they don't work
529481,tb4me,2010-12-17 15:07:00,3295,2 Pairs of socks with the hand warmers in between the layers of sock..Works like a charm
529483,thebigcatch,2010-12-17 15:13:00,138,2 Pairs of socks with the hand warmers in between the layers of sock..Works like a charm   I did that but my wading boots are to tight with all that stuff in there lol I guess I'll have to Buy now boots
529484,brifishrgy,2010-12-17 15:13:00,559,"could always try electric socks, only prob with them I see is the batteries need to go on to of the socks, could always rewire them to have the batteries in your pant pocket  electric socks"
529486,solopaddler,2010-12-17 15:24:00,8605," So you're wearing stockingfoot waders? That's your problem.  In winter you should switch to a good pair of 5mm neoprene BOOTFOOT waders with insulated boots.  With the boots big enough to accomodate hvy socks and still leave wiggle room you're feet will be toasty.  These waders are good, cheap and super warm:  http://www.cabelas.com/product/Footwear/Mens-Footwear/Mens-Waders/Mens-Fishing-Waders%7C/pc/104797980/c/104747580/sc/104674680/i/103926780/Cabelas-Spring-Run8482-5mm-Felt-1000-gram-Waders-Regular/722709.uts?destination=/catalog/browse/footwear-mens-footwear-mens-waders-mens-fishing-waders/_/N-1101197/Ns-CATEGORY_SEQ_103926780"
529497,ctranter,2010-12-17 16:37:00,543,"My buddy DMASSE hinted me on this one after I nearly froze my toes off on our lasting outting.  I was wearing 3 pears of thick socks, but it was still DAMN cold and we were standing in 1/2 a foot of snow while fishing.  Check out wigwam socks (I like the ""Canadian"" model).  These things are seriously warm.  The only issue is that they are so warm that you will sweat in them, meaning it's good practice to wear a base layer (NOT COTTON) underneath to whisk away any moisture to an insulated layer.  Did I mention they are great for ice fishing?  Bass Pro and Gagnons carry them (probably many other stores too)."
529509,ccmtcanada,2010-12-17 17:08:00,7971,"You can find foot warmers...same as the hand ones, but not as bulky and designed for your feet.  You can also find even smaller ones that keep your toes warm.  They don't take up the same room inside your boot and for me they work great!  You could lose a layer of socks if you are putting more than two pairs on and replace with these.

Good luck!"
529524,thebigcatch,2010-12-17 17:44:00,138,Thaxz for all the help guys I will try and see if this works for me!
529542,mercman,2010-12-17 18:29:00,7054,"My brother has the same problem.His is caused by a condition i cant pronounce let alone spell. What he does is put insoles that reflect the heat back to his feet, and 2 pairs of browning hunting socks.These socks help keep moisture away from the feet, he says.  "
