528766,Headhunter,2010-12-15 16:13:00,5703,"Sorry for the delay in reporting this... I was in the Ajax Costco on Sunday and they have this http://www.costco.ca/Browse/Product.aspx?Prodid=10329725&search=Ice%20Auger&topnav=&Mo=0&cm_re=1_en-_-Top_Left_Nav-_-Top_search&lang=en-CA&Nr=P_CatalogName:BCCA&N=0&whse=BCCA&Dx=mode%20matchallpartial&Ntk=Text_Search&Dr=P_CatalogName:BCCA&Ne=4000000&D=Ice%20Auger&Ntt=Ice%20Auger&No=0&Nty=1&Ntx=mode%20matchallpartial in stock, actually they had 6 in stock on Sunday. The price was $289.00, which I thought was a good deal. Anyway, just thought I'd pass this along for those on the market for a new auger. HH"
528780,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-15 16:51:00,3761," 289, 299 seems to be the perfect price. There was a auger at CT in Lindsay for 299-3hp it was. If it's there after christmas im buying one. Can't beat it."
528890,Jer,2010-12-15 23:04:00,1426,"  I bought the Eskimo Mako at Costco a few weeks ago. I think it was $284.99.  The Mako has a 43cc motor, the one at CT for $299 is the Eskimo Sidewinder with only a 33cc motor if that makes much difference."
528903,trapshooter,2010-12-16 00:17:00,1234,I bought one of these last year and the Eskimo's are by far the easiest starting auger I've ever seen on the ice.
528961,GBW,2010-12-16 02:32:00,8460,"Mike, if it was a Jiffy you had seen there it is/was a refurbished unit.  CTC sells a LOT of refurb Jiffy units each year.  Oh and Costco offers a 2-year warranty and frankly they take back anything at any point as long as you have the bill.  Jer, the 43 is 2HP so the 22 it 1.5HP I would guess?  Ben, good to know as I bought one this year, yee haa!"
528966,Joey,2010-12-16 02:42:00,9122,"  Actually, they'll take back anything even if you don't have a bill.  I found that out a few weeks ago when I had to return something about 2 months after I bought it and could not find the bill.  They went clickity clickity on thier computer and it was there and they refunded no problem.  Actually, that's kind of scary - Big Costco Brother watching"
528968,GBW,2010-12-16 02:45:00,8460,they have the best return program over ANY store.
529020,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-16 04:07:00,3761,If I can find a fellow OFC member that want's to go for a drive from Lindsay to the nearest Costco let me know.
529021,pidge,2010-12-16 04:14:00,438,"Princess Auto has them as well, but I'd be lying on a price."
529022,irishfield,2010-12-16 04:19:00,26272,PA.. $500 and they're sold out according to their website.
529026,GBW,2010-12-16 04:32:00,8460,PM ME where you are at now as I MAY be able to help
