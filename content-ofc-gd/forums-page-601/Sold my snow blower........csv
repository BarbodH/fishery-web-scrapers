528506,lew,2010-12-14 22:28:00,12766,"Well, I've got a nearly new Toro sitting here, infact it's only been used twice and is still under full warranty, but after cleaning up the last snowfall I can't use it anymore because the handle that controls the chute is outta whack now and I can't aim it anymore.  I called the Toro dealership today and they said they'll come and pick it up and repair it under warranty , but to do that and then return it to me will cost me $100 which I'm certainly not gonna pay.  I had to load it into the back of the pick-up this afternoon, which wasn't easy by myself seeing as it weighs 222 pounds, and tomorrow I'll make the 40 mile round trip to drop it off.  They said it'll take about a week to fix it...if they've got the parts....then I'll have to do another 40 mile round trip to pick it up.  Sure hope winter doesn't get nasty for a week or so"

Here's last weeks snowfall for us in London  (what a great time to be off work with an arm injury)  so far we've already exceeded last years snowfall total, although it was almost a record low last year....  just to the north and west of us they have gotten almost 6 ft of the stuff over the last week and a half."

528895,lew,2010-12-15 23:50:00,12766, I had to go into town today to do some shopping so I dropped the Toro off on the way and they had the repair done in 15 minutes and it was ready to go again.  The Toro dealer is also a John Deere dealer and if there's waranty work to be done on my JD lawn tractor there's a $100 pick-up and delivery fee for that also.
