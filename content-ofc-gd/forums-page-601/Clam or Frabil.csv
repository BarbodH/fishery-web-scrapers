527990,fishhunter,2010-12-13 04:04:00,604,lol well Ron you were a good cook but Wayne had a nicer smile so we pull up to his drive up window now
528011,Terry,2010-12-13 11:15:00,14456,the fast food take out window is a nice feature on the Eskimo and Frabil  and service was great
528040,misfish,2010-12-13 13:23:00,29133," Thanks Wayne. Im looking for a two man for room.I had the pe-1. Just a little cramp with the suit on.If I dont find what Im looking for,I,ll give a shout. Thanks again."
528050,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-12-13 13:37:00,1362,"Al,  Give Stacy a call at ProTackle in Bellville....he had lots of Frabils last week. I just picked up some hyflex runners for mine...  http://www.protacklemuskyshop.com/newsshow.php?id=117"
528058,walleyejack,2010-12-13 13:59:00,358,"Thanks, will give them a call today,rather support an individual than corporate,but these times,everyone can use the business"
528568,2jack2,2010-12-15 00:06:00,92,"Hi Walleyejack, just checked, we have the Trekker for $399.99, 5 available to order, if you are still interested, give me a call at BPS, you can check the product out at http://www.basspro.com/Frabill-Trekker-Ice-Fishing-Shelter/product/10217247/-1719710 Thanks"
528602,walleyejack,2010-12-15 01:43:00,358,"  GRRRRRRRRRR I called up there and was told they are not available,only in the states.That is one of the fishing guys up there told me,and,I called twice and talked to two different people,the first one told me they didn t carry that model. I bought one from someone that one of the members on this board put me onto. thanks anyway for your help,maybe someon up there needs to refresh the sales people on the products they carry."
528641,muskymatt,2010-12-15 03:56:00,2608," Ditto...love my frabill, easy set up, lots of storage...very comfy."
528644,irishfield,2010-12-15 03:58:00,26272,"Walleyejack.. I told you 2jack2 (Jackie Chan) was the one to talk to at BPS.. not sure what's wrong with the rest of the crew. 2jack2 knows what's going on in there.  Once again.. thanks for waiting for me out in Scarberia tonight. Driving was rediculous taking an hour and a half to get from Sinai to the Town Centre, but at least I now have a two man hut for my neighbour up at the lake."
528649,walleyejack,2010-12-15 04:05:00,358, Your welcome.
528805,SylvanOwner,2010-12-15 17:53:00,266,"  Can you please let me know where you bought these from, just the thing I've been looking for.  I see you're from Ottawa, anyone know where in the GTA?  How do they attach?"
528831,ch312,2010-12-15 19:24:00,1590,"clam FTW  great product and excellent customer service. i received a 100% free clam 2000 a few years back because a sharp piece of plastic cut the tarp about 2"". i now have a yukon thermal and it's awesome.  like others have mentioned...it basically comes down to personal preference.  fishing world in hamilton has had the best prices for the 4 huts that we have purchased"
528855,daryl0815,2010-12-15 21:03:00,225,"Hey I noticed that you are from Whitby, so am I!  Gagnons in Oshawa has a decent deal on a Frabil right now, I wish I had the money to grab one!  http://www.store.gagnonsports.com/index.php?product=FRAB-6000  I was in there the other day, and it looks like a decent set-up.  Good luck! I hope to be on the hard water in the new year!"
528948,2jack2,2010-12-16 02:09:00,92, BPS has them
529254,camillj,2010-12-16 22:29:00,1988,Sorry boys .. Eastman 4 man ...cube for me .. bigger (alot) .. and lighter and easier to carry (drag) .... and for the extra minute and a half it takes to set up .. its soooo worth it....
529290,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-16 23:53:00,10439, I have a 2 man cube that I use during early ice and switch to my flip over once the ice is thick enough to drag it around with my 1000cc powered Yamaha sled. The extra weight doesn't bother me.
527815,walleyejack,2010-12-12 20:01:00,358,"I am sure this has been asked many times,Clam or Frabill flipover 2 man.No Frabill dealers in the GTA i can find,only Bass Pro.Any opinions on which is better would be appreciate it.Have read Clam has bolt problems,not a big deal go to Princess Auto and buy a few handfulls,if that is the only issue,I think Clam has heavier material,but don t know if they cut back on that also."
527817,fishermccann,2010-12-12 20:06:00,655,Mine is a Clam 2000 not a flip over but cabin style lots of room for 2 men a heater and a dog.
527831,Old Man,2010-12-12 21:14:00,822,I love my Frabill. Three years of extensive use and not one problem.  
527856,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-12 22:05:00,10439,I'm partial to my Frabil as well. Their customer service is what will keep me coming back!!!! I have heard Clams customer service is not as good.    
527862,walleyejack,2010-12-12 22:18:00,358,"i have heard that rumor also, can t find a dealer around Tornto tho"
527865,misfish,2010-12-12 22:33:00,29133,Anyone know whos selling the HT flips?  I had one and would like to buy another. I found that thier fabric was better/stronger then the frabil. JMO  Nice one man hut Dave.
527866,Grimace,2010-12-12 22:35:00,2020,"I can not speak for Clam but I do Love my Frabill Predator.  I am sure Clam make a good shelter, I just have not been in one so I can not endorse one."
527874,Dondorfish,2010-12-12 22:52:00,1000,Much like Grimace - only the other way - I have a Clam Guide ( 2 man flip) and love it - never tried the frabil.  Tracker (Don)
527884,Terry,2010-12-12 23:27:00,14456,I really like my clam  when I wore some holes in it I asked calm where I could buy some repair material.....they asked for my address and sent me a bunch free..........  sounds like great service to me
527900,Fisherman,2010-12-13 00:01:00,7201,"I won't buy another Frabil product after the royal corkscrewing I got from them, Clam with some aftermarket real stainless hardware, not the chinese junk, or, go buy one of the Otter huts, cost more, last longer."
527911,walleyejack,2010-12-13 00:44:00,358," I know Angling Outfitters in Woodstock where selling HT last year,not sure about this year,but i would assume so."
527916,irishfield,2010-12-13 00:54:00,26272," Definitely a real heavy fabric compared to Clam or Frabill Brian. I have a, basically new, PE-1 (one man) in the hangar if you're interested.  As for Clam / Frabill Al... tamato.. tomato... Both have about the same density fabric. I like the way my Frabil sits as a wind break and I can put various center poles in to make it overhang as a rain/snow shelter roof, yet still have it open to the elements. Terry and Lloyd's clams don't seem to do this.. but maybe they just don't bring the poles or bother to set them up the way I like mine. The bigger Clams like the Yukon have a deeper tobogan than my Frabill Trekker. I think it just comes right down to the personal touches on what you like seat wise, colour, tobogan depth etc."
527921,irishfield,2010-12-13 01:11:00,26272,As for a Frabill dealer Al.. I'm sure I saw them in LeBaron's catalogue.. Jackie Chan ( 2jack2 ) told me Bass Pro can get the trekker in for $399.. Canadian Tire sells the Trekker but it's $499 there.
527924,walleyejack,2010-12-13 01:17:00,358," I was searching their website for dealer locations,nothing comes up in Ontario,Bass pro has the predtor,don t want to spend that much.Maybe i call them tomorrow and see where their Ont.dealers are. Checked out the Otters,nice but about 150 more for the Wild,which is a little cheaper model,and the ice cabin is 300 more,not doing that, or ill be living in it full time,     hey that might not be a bad idea"
527925,walleyejack,2010-12-13 01:20:00,358," I did the Canadian tire thing today,they don t carry them,checked out Lebarons catalogue yesterday,only had HT I believe they were,and some Clams that were a little more $ than Gagnons even,will have to call.Maybe Bass Pro would order in,they don t stock the Trecker,is it a 2 man Wayne ? with paded swivel seats that are mounted to the sled ?"
527932,irishfield,2010-12-13 01:34:00,26272,Yes the trekker is a 2 man and there have been various seats. Some got ripped off for camp chairs.. mine has seats with a fold down back rest that slide along the tobogan edge... BUT they do NOT swivel.  They have one in stock in the Midland store according to the computer. It's been there since spring when I was hoping they'd have their usual 50% off sale and of course they didn't!  Pics of mine      
527937,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-13 01:44:00,10439, FYI It's not a Trekker it is called an Adventurer (made for CT) and it doesn't have the Trekkers stadium seats or stretcher poles. It comes with those little triangular folding seats (uber uncomfortable)  Even the one on display at our CT is an Adventurer with the crappy seats.
527938,irishfield,2010-12-13 01:45:00,26272,"It's actually called the Trekker again this years stock Dave. I know they threw in that oddball.. made for CTC Adventurer that you ""converted"" last year! lol"
527941,walleyejack,2010-12-13 01:46:00,358,"I like that setup Wayne,the seats on the sled and slide,don t care if they swivel. mm Interesting, the CTC in town here says none of the stores carry the Trekker this year,i ask him to check and he told me they dont,only reason there might be one somewhere is from last years stock,but it would be worth the drive to BP to save the $100 i guess. I didn t see any fish flipping in those pics, what up with that !!!"
527947,irishfield,2010-12-13 01:56:00,26272,"CTC Product #78-8193-8  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/SportsRec/Fishing/IceFishing/PRD~0788193P/Frabill%252BTrekker%252B2-Man%252BFlip-Over%252BIce%252BShelter.jsp?locale=en  In stock in Midland as of yesterday.. but I'd make them check physically at any location before venturing out. Also as Dave has pointed out.. be sure it's actually a Trekker and has the seats and centre poles.. 4 of them 2 spreaders, rear pole and the most important front telescopic one.  Also says it's in stock in Barrie and Orillia  http://www.canadiantire.ca/checkinventory/check_inventory.jsp?CTC_STORE_SEARCH%3C%3EshowCities=false&CTC_STORE_SEARCH%3C%3EshowResults=false&CTC_STORE_SEARCH%3C%3EprovinceList=&CTC_STORE_SEARCH%3C%3Etype=store&CTC_STORE_SEARCH%3C%3Epostal_cd=L4R5K9&CTC_STORE_SEARCH%3C%3EbackupType=store&PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524443321787&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=1408474396672364&bmForm=form_store_locator&bmFormID=1292205352545&bmSubmit=find_inv_stores&bmUID=1292205352545&bmHash=4d65d269ed86b530b17c8f96f23094c2c1d1cbfe"
527949,walleyejack,2010-12-13 02:00:00,358," Thanks, I guess the guy in my store doesn t know whats happ then."
527951,irishfield,2010-12-13 02:03:00,26272,"If you end up getting that one.. have them let you open it up... be sure those 4 poles are there and the solid seats. Dave got taken way up in Yellowknife, last year, for the economy version (Adventure made just for CTC) but him and Frabill came to an understanding pronto.  I just checked the stores ""local"" to Jennifer's here in the West end and all say check with store.. so NO stock in other words."
527955,walleyejack,2010-12-13 02:10:00,358," ok thanks for the good advice, I checked store out in Oshawa and Ajax and say in stock,the guy in Whitb store was lost in space i guess."
527965,Ron,2010-12-13 02:53:00,1683,"I got a Clam Yukon now but some times, I still miss my Eskimo quick flip. In fact, next year when I sell this one, I am going back to the Eskimo.  The Eskimo had a thicker toboggan and also had Velcro windows. This made it easier to be set up on the ice as a drive through window serving lunches."
527967,irishfield,2010-12-13 02:58:00,26272,I took over that side business Ron.. The Frabil windows velco in and out.. with the blackening flaps as well..
