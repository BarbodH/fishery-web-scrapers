528724,Beans,2010-12-15 14:47:00,3339,"  TRIP TO COSTCO      Yesterday, I was at my local COSTCO buying a large bag of Purina dog chow for my loyal pet, Biscuit, the Wonder Dog and was in the checkout line when a woman behind me asked if I had a dog. What did she think I had, an elephant? So, since I'm retired and have little to do, on impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was starting the Purina Diet once again. I added that I probably shouldn't, because I ended up in the hospital the last time, but that I'd lost 50 pounds before I awakened in an intensive care ward with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms. I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pants pockets with Purina nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete, so it works well and I was going to try it once again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in line was now enthralled with my story.) Horrified, she asked if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no, I stepped off a curb to sniff an Irish Setter's ass and a car hit the both of us. I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard. COSTCO won't let me shop there anymore.Better watch what you ask retired people. They have all the time in the world to think of crazy things to say. "

A lady came in one day and asked him where she could find the sanitary napkins, he told her and added if you need help fitting them I am available. She complained to the store manager and they fired him. Some people can`t take a joke."
