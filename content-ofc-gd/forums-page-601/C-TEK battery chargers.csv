528788,Roy,2010-12-15 17:09:00,13728,There was some talk of those chargers a few weeks ago and some guys were looking for them. Just received my CTC flyer and they're on special reg. $90. for $54. Sale starts Thursday or Friday....I never read that part.
528815,Fisherman,2010-12-15 18:34:00,7201,"I've got 2, they work like a charm."
528817,knightfisher,2010-12-15 18:56:00,237,"They work great, I recommend them."
528826,walleyejack,2010-12-15 19:19:00,358," They are good for trickle charge, like a battery maintaner ? 2map hr  ?"
528837,walleyejack,2010-12-15 19:43:00,358," In my flyer the C-teck was not on but this on was. Motomaster Eliminator Intelligent Battery Charger, 2A Product #11-1506-6 $60. for $35"
528900,icefisherman,2010-12-16 00:06:00,952,"Got mine couple months ago and it is the best charger I've ever owed...amazing piece of equipment, small and light but packed with top notch electronics...and very SMART ...one of my battery is currently sitting connected to it for the past few weeks. I'll connect it to the other battery in few weeks or so... Highly recommended.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
528907,Terry,2010-12-16 00:23:00,14456, it seems it's both a maintainer and a charger at 3.3 ah  I wouldn't want to use the trolling motor 2 days in a row...most likely take more then 24 hours to charge up a well used battery
528913,Fish Farmer,2010-12-16 00:36:00,2234,"Thanks Roy, I'll be checking our store. Last time it came on sale they were sold out."
529063,Roy,2010-12-16 13:31:00,13728,I just checked the flyer again and the Coleman SportCat heater is on sale at half price. That might also be a good deal for someone.
529458,Terry,2010-12-17 14:11:00,14456,it now showed up in their online flyer http://www.canadiantire.ca/browse/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524443306624&bmUID=1292595010859
