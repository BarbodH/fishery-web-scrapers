But then Again...I live in Kitchener, 40 minutes south west of the center of the Universe Snow here is easy, and rarely an issue."
528945,cram,2010-12-16 02:07:00,1733, There's a massive difference but you don't know til you try.  Ironically I think most mainstream winter tires are actually ice tires (vs. snow)
528950,Bernie,2010-12-16 02:12:00,3190,"Here is an article I wrote last winter on tires.  WINTER TIRES As a mechanic and a shop owner I get to try out various types of vehicles during test drives. So we get to try out different types of tires too. We learn what works well and what doesn't. Don't kid yourself, all season tires don't come close to a quality winter tire on ice and snow. And when you add studs to a winter tire it makes them incredibly good. I hope they allow studded tires where you drive. All season tires work well when they can contact the road surface directly, but when isolated from the road by ice and snow they just don't work. The compound of the tire is generally harder to resist summer heat that wears tires out and with the colder temperatures they just get stiffer. The winter tire compound is a little softer which allows a better contact patch with whatever is under it and the larger tread gaps pinch the snow to gain traction. Another big misconception with tires is putting them on the drive wheels only. OK, why not you ask? Well lets start with one of the most common vehicles on the road today, a family sedan, front wheel drive. On these cars your engine and transmission is front mounted, so a good part of the weight is front biased. So that puts lots of weight on your front wheels. Weight =traction, right? So you put your winter tires on the front and your already used all seasons on the back. Imagine now cruising down the freeway in 4 inches of fresh snow, ""man these winter tires are awesome !"" But you need to brake in a hurry for a deer coming out. Well those fresh winters do their job OK but the lightweight back end of your car hasn't the traction to handle the maneuver, the back end is sliding around sideways...hang on to it!!! Well you get the picture now. You need all 4.  DONT SPIN YOUR TIRES  How many times do you see it each slippery day? You know, the drivers wheels howling for mercy as they attempt to accelerate. Many vehicles today are equipped with traction control, there is a good reason for this accessory to your vehicle. If you can accelerate without spinning you will get moving faster than someone who is, and under more control too. A spinning tire will often create a hot spot under itself, melt the ice or snow and make it even more slippery. You even run the risk of getting yourself stuck in the rut you create. A spinning tire also will go sideways easier, as it loses traction it also loses some direction."
528956,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-16 02:20:00,0,"  Like anders said, my local highway is bad all winter. Caution and common sense go a long way. Next, you can tell me about that HUGE storm you got once up at the cottage in the kawarthas!  It was so bad, they had no internet for days! I love hearing about how bad it gets in the south."

528975,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-16 02:54:00,0,"  sometimes, young families use all seasons because they can't afford special tires for half the year.  and i stand by the fact that they are adequate if you exercise caution."

I can't believe they can confirm the direction of polarity though core samples.  Incredible.  Hmm, if I were you, I would be watching my neighbour a little closer.  Perhaps they are ""redistributing"" their snow while you are cozy inside watching tv.  hehe."
528478,mercman,2010-12-14 21:08:00,7054," humm....good idea. I'll let you know. What direction is it sposed to turn, and is the rotation affected by flotsam ?"
528479,kickingfrog,2010-12-14 21:15:00,8333,"A couple of other factors to be considered for central/southern ON:  Temperatures that bounce around that critical zero degrees Celsius leave roads much more treacherous than when its almost never near zero degrees, and change from minute to minute or Km by Km.  Lake affect snow with high winds. Higher moisture in the air that leads to more volatile and unpredictable weather.  The incredibly high number of people that live over an hour from the place they work.  The last point is based on our own choices, but is still a reality. Believe me, many of us would love to live closer to where we work, but the jobs are in one place, and where we want to/ can afford to live is in another.  This a diverse land, understand it, embrace it."
528579,cram,2010-12-15 00:47:00,1733,"Curious - how many of you northern guys have studs on your winter tires?  I know they're legal up there (and not here).  Do you use them?  If so, I assume the differnece is night and day?"
528583,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-15 00:51:00,0,i use motomaster all season radials.
528592,Twocoda,2010-12-15 01:20:00,4130, i could be wrong but ...i dont think studs are legal in ontario...alberta they are though ...
528594,Raf,2010-12-15 01:27:00,3495,"studs are legal in northern ontario.  the address on your license has to be north of sudbury - i believe that is the dividing line  warm water on huron and gbay from a hot summer, coupled with some really strong cold north winds has produced some nasty lake effect squalls responsible for all this mess.  the people in the affected areas are not unaccustomed to lots of snow by any means it's just been that much worse this year"
528603,Dave Bailey,2010-12-15 01:44:00,1641," And THAT is one of the things that northerners don't have to face. A streamer coming off Hudson Bay will never make it far enough to affect Sudbury, North Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Thunder Bay, etc. They aren't very predictable, and when they do occur they snake around like a whip, the tail end could be dumping snow on Brampton at 2pm and then move to Markham by 3, and back again by 4.   Another truism. There aren't many people in Sudbury who work in North Bay, nor many in Timmins who work in Cochrane. In most northern communities the work is where you live, down here your company might move around a few times for various reasons, and if you want to keep your job, benefits, and pension, you either move house or face a different and sometimes longer commute.  There's also the whole 'used to it' factor to consider. I don't laugh at Floridians when they get a rare belt of winter, they shouldn't be 'used to it', and instead I sympathize with their plight. Nor should they laugh at us when we get a stifling heat wave or the odd hurricane - we're not set up to handle it, and it would be uneconomical to be prepared for them all the time. Should we laugh at northerners when they come down here and get lost in a maze of Toronto traffic in a rush hour? I don't, and I've helped out quite a few with directions, advice, and even sometimes a 'follow me', even if it takes me out of my way. You can have a quiet chuckle among your fellows, but to throw it in the face of those who are genuinely inconvenienced is a bully tactic that is only done to make yourself feel superior. Next time a northern community is staring down a forest fire I can guarantee that southerners will not be laughing, instead we'll be sending aid."
528608,Dave Bailey,2010-12-15 01:52:00,1641," I think it's the French River, at least that was always the point at which license fees went down."
528611,kickingfrog,2010-12-15 02:03:00,8333,"All seasons are almost useless in winter. Next, we'll be hearing about modern televisions from a guy still using analog."

Ya they are ugly as hell, but i am safer with them on my car."
528666,troutologist,2010-12-15 05:01:00,951," Really?  SSM gets the bulk of its big snow events due to lake effect blowing across superior. it freezes over less frequently than Gbay/huron and would arguably have a greater effect as open water persists later into the winter. the snow belt just a few km north of town is intense, as is the one further north where I used to icefish."
528707,Dave Bailey,2010-12-15 13:42:00,1641," Yep, realised I screwed up on the Soo. Buffalo and the Niagara peninsula get basically the same thing, and if we get a weather pattern coming from the east we get whacked pretty good too. But it holds for most other places in the north."

Big problem I see is the distances people follow on the hwys down south, way too close to expeditiously maneuver should the need arise to do so.  Lot to be learn going to an empty parking lot learning how to correct skids etc. plus its good fun.

528405,Spiel,2010-12-14 16:42:00,9065,"  That's funny cause the one on that show from St. Catherines is my old bosses wife, she's brutal, snow or no snow!  "
528423,mercman,2010-12-14 17:34:00,7054," she is one scarey  driver !! I'm surprised they didnt call her insurance and cancel her.But the guy from Ottawa.....sheesh, take the bus man....Automotive bi-polarism...."
528429,cram,2010-12-14 18:06:00,1733," Major hwy that sees high volume.   Plus that area is 3+ hrs away from Toronto.  Its not ""the big city""."
528430,fishing n autograph,2010-12-14 18:16:00,2540, the media make a big deal out of anything?? C'mon that never happens.......
528431,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-14 18:17:00,0," Are you by chance stranded in your hyundai right now cram? Forgot the snowtires did we?  They're in the garage, right next to the common sense."
528437,cram,2010-12-14 18:45:00,1733," Yep, you got me.   You're so smart, Dr S.  Here's my point -- even if they're not as snow savvy as you, there were a bunch of families (some with little kids, i assume) stuck there all night.....and it was pretty cold last night.  I wouldn't be making fun of them."
528445,troutologist,2010-12-14 19:13:00,951,"In my limited perusing of the news I didn't get any numbers of snowfall, temps etc.  What was the cause of the strandings? Volume of snow? Lack of visibility? Read somewhere that 300 were caught out....seems like I am missing some of the story here. I guess I just don't understand how conditions came in so fast/severe that people were caught.  Goes to show how a survival kit in the vehicle can come in handy even if its there for years and never used. (ideally)"
527927,TJQ,2010-12-13 01:26:00,7806,"I love Canada. I love northern Ontario.  I love the fact that where I live there are 4 distinct seasons, each with its own little batch of problems.  Its winter... I think we can all agree on that.  We have at least a foot of blowing snow here and much more overnight. I had a hard time with my 4 wheeler, getting to the end of my driveway tonight where the snowplow on the transcanada highway is down to one lane and has seen fit to put the other lanes in my driveway... It was an adventure!!  Its like this every year... it was like this last year ... and it will be like this next year.  I live here and I expect it... I love it!!! It's called Canada.... in the winter.  ... but if I have to listen to one more Toronto newscaster on the TV whine about how bad the weather is there today.... and how the hotdog vendors couldn't sell hotdogs today .. or how the skating rinks were empty...... someones gonna wind up looking like Koscheck.... can someone from the GTA please go and explain to them where they live... in Canada.. please....  There. I feel better, thanks for listening."
527928,mercman,2010-12-13 01:30:00,7054,merry christmas TJ
527929,ctranter,2010-12-13 01:31:00,543,"I agree, Toronto is extremely lucky geographically.  Pretty much everyone else in every direction gets more snow, and Torontarians are serial complainers."
527930,Leecher,2010-12-13 01:33:00,7832,I feel better too TJ after reading this Leechman
527931,The Urban Fisherman,2010-12-13 01:34:00,2050,"if this was facebook I'd ""like"" your thread TJ! haha bring on the snow and more importantly THE ICE!  Cheers, Ryan"
527933,irishfield,2010-12-13 01:37:00,26272,Glad you got enough snow off the rock to crawl out and play with us today Boss !!
527936,TJQ,2010-12-13 01:43:00,7806," LOL... Ya i hear ya.. I haven't been on much lately... watching everyday... Its my busy time of year and the days are just flying by.. thats a fact.,	Ill do better I swear!!"
527950,Joey,2010-12-13 02:01:00,9122,"Yup, I hear ya TJ.  What bugs my butt is when they close schools and the school buses don't run when there's a smattering of snow."
527964,Dave Bailey,2010-12-13 02:52:00,1641,"To be fair, there are a few extra problems here that the rest of the province doesn't have to face. One is the amount of traffic, nobody else has the density we have here, and rush hours are hell on even a sunny August afternoon. Rush hour in a place like Sudbury only gets delays if someone is trying to join the drive-thru lineup at Timmies. The other is the type of snow we get. Toronto creates a heat bubble, we're a bit warmer than surrounding areas, and as a result we don't often get the fluffy, easily moved snow that areas even close by enjoy. We get a heavy wet crap that isn't easy to live with. I spent many years working at Pearson with airfield maintenance, clearing snow from runways, taxiways, aprons, and roads. Not fun. I've also spent time in places like Ottawa in winter, they're colder and they get stuff that's so light that all you need to do to clear your front steps is give a good sneeze. But I admit that I was profoundly embarrassed a few years ago when an Argos rally at city hall was canceled due to cold weather. That makes Torontonians look like ultra-wimps."
527969,walleyejack,2010-12-13 02:59:00,358,"i was pretty ticked off when watching the weather on ctv and she said it is going to be ""bitter cold the next few days"" -4 is bitter cold ? like she needs to smell the coffee."
527970,OhioFisherman,2010-12-13 03:03:00,6623,"LOL, it snows in Canada? What a surprise!"
527971,Twocoda,2010-12-13 03:06:00,4130, Busy time of year eh ...  ...wrapping prezzies for all us little good boys and girls? If you got my letter i sent you ....you can cancel the last 75 items on my list of wishes....but the first 225 items are a must....wake me up if you need a hand unloading the new boat... ill leave cookies out for you cheers
527973,mercman,2010-12-13 03:16:00,7054,"I tend to agree with Dave Bailey.Although winter in general is a beaufiful time of year,winter in a major city like T.O. or in my case,Montreal,has a whole different set of Rules.Traffic, snow removal,bad drivers, type of snowfal,(big cities tend to create a micro climate of warm air around itself) Plus Wind directed around and over high buildings, tends to increase in speed creating blowing snow an wind chill greater than surrounding areas. So in general,winter in big cities can seem tougher than in smaller more rural areas.But as a Montrealer,i must say that Torontonians are a bit wimpy though."

527983,hammercarp,2010-12-13 03:42:00,964,""".. can someone from the GTA please go and explain to them where they live... in Canada.. please...."" Toronto is in Canada? Actually Hamilton gets the best weather in Ontario, the part below the escarpment anyway. The section of land from Hamilton east along the southern shore of lake Ontario to the edge of Niagara Falls is protected from a lot of the worst weather."
527994,cram,2010-12-13 04:20:00,1733,"I think its news people making it seem important/newsworthy more than ""torontonians"" in general. Also, like Dave said -- snow impacts dense cities differently.  A moderate snowfall can turn a 20 min drive into a 2hr drive.  Not kidding."
527997,crossover,2010-12-13 04:37:00,172,50 years from now the climate will be to effed up to make a thread like this
527999,discophish,2010-12-13 04:58:00,392," Are you sure the network was not reporting on the hotdog vendors that checked into the addiction centers after ""blowing snow""?  No wonder they couldn't sell their hotdogs!  Lots of interesting things going on here, but no snow in the core."
528002,bigugli,2010-12-13 05:12:00,6138,"You have to remember that the weathermen in T.O. are pandering to a viewer audience that never grew up with real winters, or any winter, for that matter. They wear winter clothing the moment the needle hits 50F/10C. They'd lose their jobs if they stood up and said ""looks like we'll have lots of snow for the holidays, isn't it great?"""
528005,Cookslav,2010-12-13 05:55:00,1457,"Micro climates resulting in heavy snow & building driven winds??? LOL...Sounds Like The center of the universe can be a ruff place sometimes  Go visit London, or talk to the good folks in Huron and Bruce counties about ""heavy"" snow and winds, and they'll tell ya to blow your micro climate/building theory out the tail pipe  If you asked me... I think if Torontonian weather forecasters didn't have something to Gripe about they'd Have nothing to say at all."
528008,Whitespinnerbait,2010-12-13 10:16:00,2038,  Happens every year ......but the Media still makes a BIG deal out of it
528010,Rich Clemens,2010-12-13 11:14:00,3131,No worries TJ.  Ya only have a few more months to go.
528015,solopaddler,2010-12-13 12:02:00,8605,"Dave already touched on it, but if I lived in a less populated area with less traffic on the roads...bring it on baby!  Living down here, even a minor snow event is a major problem if you're forced to drive.  You're at the whim of every inept imbecile who can't drive in the snow."
528023,Handlebarz,2010-12-13 12:50:00,3790,what the hell we have a snow day at work today YEEHAW and heck we dont have that much snow on the ground but the blowing snow is making the HWY icy and for once the drivers have stuck together and called it quits for the day its about time our drivers stick together.  I love the snow but would rather sit and watch the other people slip and slide on the roadways.  bad side for me I will be out there around midnight tonight hitting the roads to make up for missing today.
528033,aplumma,2010-12-13 13:12:00,6896,Mornin T.J. at least you all have had more practice on the white stuff. Down here if we see white stuff we hop into our Soccer Mom SUV's and must run to the stores before we get snowed in for a day. While I don't mind the white stuff short term... we get snow then we warm up enough for it to melt off then repeat as it happens. I remember living in Michigan and it was around for months at a time but it changes into this hard substance that you cant make snowmen out of and to ski was just horrible. If we could get the media to put a positive spin on the whole snow thing the winters would be less of an issue and more of a pleasure for all.  Art
