529698,tknohpy,2010-12-18 01:03:00,162,Hey Guys  I am new to Hamilton and am thinking about trying some ice fishing on the lower Grand.  Would like to hook up with someone who has fished the area before and could show me a few places to start.  If you are interested let me know!

He has a tackle shop and a charter business, both by that name, on the lower Grand just past the beer store and over the tracks. He can send you the right way.  I have never been on the ice but he and others around here could be helpful. All the best."
