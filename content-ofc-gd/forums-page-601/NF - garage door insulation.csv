528616,Twocoda,2010-12-15 02:26:00,4130,im going to assume there are 2x6 walls above the 2x10 3 plys (floor Joists) and 4 ply in the third pic....they should be insulated R20 from the inside of the house....is the interior of the house in this room cathedral ceiling ...because moore vents were to be place all the way up the entire roof or a false roof was to be built from the inside to create 1 1/2 inch ventilation of the cathedral...if they foamed right to the sheeting (that your shingles are on ) its done wrong and heat and cold will transfer through ( hopefully this isnt the case ...because its a painful deal if it is )  in pic 3 i think i see batt insulation sticking out from the cathedral ceiling from the habitable space....no vents = not correct but it is hard to determine from these pics..  were the garage walls insulated ???if so ...they should have been insulated all the way up to the stick framing for the cathedral with vents ..  do you have pics after the insulation was installed???
528619,Twocoda,2010-12-15 02:35:00,4130,everywhere the duct work is ( inside the bulkhead) ...should have been insulated to code as if it was habitable space
528627,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-15 03:10:00,0,"That's truly fine electrical work. Must have been before they inspected it. How did they insulate that airspace, the bedroom wall and all the way through."
528645,GBW,2010-12-15 03:59:00,8460,"to TW and GB, I looked and no other pic's; and as far as I know they did 'staple' the wires down."
528646,GBW,2010-12-15 04:00:00,8460,If anyone would like to fight TARION about this PLEASE FEEL FREE to contact me!
528656,GBW,2010-12-15 04:26:00,8460,I was mad before I posted this about this problem here but now I'm VERY MAD!  I just went into my daughters room to give her a kiss goodnight and make sure she is tucked-in and her room is +17C!  The rest of the house is much warmer then that too. I know Tony (the site super.) here was a hard   on the guys but this is just wrong.  I even have the heat shrink wrap window covering on the windows in her room right now and it's still that cold.  Anyone want to take on Fernbrook?
528672,Twocoda,2010-12-15 05:14:00,4130,Geoff go around and adjust the heat vents to the rest of the house to see if you can blow more heat in the room for your daughter...maybe even close off the ones to rooms that arent being used ...check your furnace filter...(just thinking out loud)  is this the first time in two years you have noticed this problem?
528703,fisher,2010-12-15 13:24:00,451,"According to Tarion website, heat issues are covered for the first 2 years...  SECOND YEAR  TARION also has a second year form. The following items are covered for 2 years under TARION:  Water penetration of basement or foundation Water penetration of the rest of the building envelope Electrical system defects Plumbing system defects Heating system defects Exterior cladding defects Major structural defects Violation of the Ontario Building Codeâ€™s health and safety provisions."
528706,GBW,2010-12-15 13:41:00,8460,"Hey Twocoda, no this isn't the first time and I have closed all the other vents.  I even had the Terion people send out a person after the first year to test things and they said her room is fine for air flow and so forth.  I checked the filter the other day too and it's fine.  Fisher, I'm over 2-years in the house, coming up on 3 in the summer.  They told me to ""go away"" in a nice way..."
528732,smally21,2010-12-15 15:07:00,993,"tarion will just drag their heels until the warranty expires. i rarely  here of anyone getting satisfaction from them.  good building codes do not equal good building practices.  the majority of new homes are not thouroughly inspected anyway, lots of builders in our area are 'pre approved' as they have been around forever.  nice to see all these guys willing to help you out.  i have a feeling your garage door fix is going to grow and GROW.!!!!"
528739,GBW,2010-12-15 15:15:00,8460,I agree and I hope to have it fixed real soon.  One person has offered to provide me free white styrofoam to help out too.  His work get's lot's of it and has no use for it.
528746,torco,2010-12-15 15:25:00,656,"Well I have learned some valuable stuff from this thread.  My daughters room was 14 degrees the other night. We jacked up the heat abit and closed vents to other rooms to get her as much heat as we could, she is now around 17 degrees. She is 9 months old so its abit of concern.  Our house is 1970 sidesplit, the garage is concrete shell as far as I can tell. I am not sure what in the way of insulation is between us and the garage. I am also going to check out the windows they were replaced in the late 90's for proper insulation.  I may need to call someone in though based on what I have learned here, could be a big job.  Goodluck GBW, you wouldn't expect that on a new home."
528796,POLLIWOGG,2010-12-15 17:36:00,835,"Check tour attic, insulating was sometimes  done by the lowest guy in the pecking order on a job site and they rarely did good job. The most common mistake was not fully covering the top plate of the wall and sometimes the blown in stuff will blow around up there.  A lot of those 70's houses would overhang the basement for 2', some would put in some fiberglass and then cover with vented soffit. If this was not sealed up it was always cold.  You're best bet is to get a spray foam guy in, they've seen it all and can fix you up."
528800,POLLIWOGG,2010-12-15 17:40:00,835,"I renovated a house once, he had 5 bags of insulation in the ceiling but forgot to take it out of the bags and spread it around."
528843,Uncle Buck,2010-12-15 20:19:00,1000,my buddy used to work at a place that made garage doors...  they did tests and it's unbelievable how much energy you save by having an insulated garage door...  the father in law put the styrafoam panel in his... works good and cheap!!
528878,bigbuck,2010-12-15 22:06:00,2449,"I was flipping channels last night and at 11, lo and behold, Holmes Inspection was tackling  a house with multiple water leaks in the roof and a cold room over the garage. Insulation problems and having a vent blowing warm air into the space between the garage ceiling and the floor of the room without a cold air return were the issue. Check up in the attic to see if there is sufficient insulation and you'll have to rip out the drywall in the garage and have it spray foamed properly. Get a space heater to keep the room warm. Do what you have to do, a bit more on the hydro bill beats having a sick child. You should still be able to pursue Tarion since you did complain about the issue but did not have it resolved. I'd speak to a lawyer if I were you. A nasty letter from a lawyer can sometimes work miracles. Good luck Bud!!"
528894,Twocoda,2010-12-15 23:26:00,4130," based on the pitch of the cathedral ceiling im going to say the ceiling wasnt blown in ...its too steep for celulose to not sag to the bottom...  with the heat runs in the pics posted they look to be installed low below the floor joists...and if the bulk head wasnt treated as habitable space ...im betting the coolness of the bulkhead is cooling the air before it gets to the room....this is an easy fix though.... inconvenient ...but easy and painless..  Im going to assume your builders response wasnt favorable to what you wanted to hear  which is why you were forced to call Tarion in the first place...if i was you ...i would call your builder to come and see for himself now that the weather is cold out and if it remains an issue then revisit the Tarion route with a second opinion  In the meantime ...break out your ""Home Owners Package"" and read it thouroughly...so you understand the proper route to resolving this issue  If your builder is any kind of a company...they will make it right without involving Tarion ...too many marks against a certain company will increase his ""inventory and security"" payments to them for future builds...  Strik is right ....a builder will protect his standings with Tarion at any cost unless the home owner is totally incorrigible ( not saying this is the case here but it does happen and those people are out there) Ergo...Tarion is a ""God sent"" to some builders...  Someone suggested a space heater for the interim....good idea..do what ya have to do.."
528904,Gerritt,2010-12-16 00:18:00,6129,"What people fail to understand here is that Tarion is in fact controlled buy the large builders, intact many are on the Tarion board. Tar ion protects the builders not the homeowner."
528924,GBW,2010-12-16 01:07:00,8460,Thanks TW!  I will have a review of it when the Mrs' get's home to show me where she put it...
529197,Aaron Shirley,2010-12-16 18:43:00,655,"GBW, unfortunately, I purchased a Fernbrook home in Burlington over 5 years ago. I feel your pain. Nice looking home, but it was built like complete crap from workers that had no clue and didn`t care. Terion was little help with the huge list of problems. It was very frustrating to say the least. I am still finding things wrong every year that have to be fixed  Just in the last month alone I have learned of two major problems. I just put in a central vac unit last month and learned half the homes central vac rough-in doesn`t work and was never hooked up at all, including piping to the garage  Just this week my wife found all the windows and frames soaked and mouldy from heavy condensation all over the windows, and now I have to get someone in to look at that issue    and the list goes on...  I know there are horror stories from some builders, and unfotunately I think Fernbrook is near the top of the list. I will NEVER buy a Fernbrook home again, and neither will most people in my area. They are brutal IMO.  On a side note; I have a two-car garage with one big wooden door. I recently insulated the door by glueing the blue R10 2 inch sheets onto the inside of the door. *WARNING* The garage door is very heavy now! I didn`t realize how heavy it would make the door, so keep that in mind if you have one big door. It helped to keep my garage warmer, although I still have to insulate around the garage door and the wall to the outside, as they do not insulate that wall. I also put the weather strips all around the garage door which helped.  I have heaters in the garage installed on the ceiling aimed down at my boat to keep it warm and dry all winter, although I only put the heaters on for a day or two after a trip if the boat is wet or full of snow. Without heat, my garage stays between 5 to 10 C in the winter now and never gets below freezing."
529206,GBW,2010-12-16 18:56:00,8460,"Thanks for the info Aaron.  As for the windows, bleach will remove it then use the mold killing spray (I forget the name of it).  You have to open your blinds a bit in the day to let the window breath too.  I found that it helps."
528453,GBW,2010-12-14 19:54:00,8460,"Hey all  I'm just wondering if anyone here has installed garage door insulation.  How well does it work?  Will it help the room above the garage stay warmer?  I ask because my daughters room is over the garage, thanks.  Geoff"
528454,Roy,2010-12-14 19:56:00,13728,Great question Geoff. I'm looking for the same answers. I also need to change my door though. Also need to know which is the best door opener available.

528456,Roy,2010-12-14 20:00:00,13728, Really? Mine's a little bigger door... kind of like a garage and a half.
528458,Terry,2010-12-14 20:11:00,14456,it will help so will good sweeps on bottom and top and weather strips on sides  are you looking at the fiberglass with the vinyl on one side and you stick on pins to hold it

528461,bigbuck,2010-12-14 20:17:00,2449,"I hate to say this but is your garage drywalled?? If so, you may need to remove it to inspect the ducting and insulation. I don't know if you watch Holmes on Holmes but this is an issue that he has run into time and time again. The room should be as warm as the rest of the house. Are you still covered under the Tarion new home warranty??"
528462,Gerritt,2010-12-14 20:21:00,6129,"Geoff, perhaps I should make a road trip?  G"

And the house is 2.5 years old so Tarion will not do anything.  I have a buddy that got a insulation sprayer may come and visit and check it out.  Sure, it's up to you G if you want to treck out to Brooklin."
528466,GBW,2010-12-14 20:37:00,8460,"Same, the walls too."
528474,fish_fishburn,2010-12-14 21:03:00,1311,"I just used the 1"" white styrofoam insulation. Just cut it to size to fit the door panels then taped them together with duct tape at the seams and done. It's not the prettiest but it does the job. They have been on there for almost 15 yrs now and still no problems."
528476,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-14 21:06:00,0,Are you 100% sure there's insulation in the floor above the garage? I've seen it where the insulation was removed from a house before the drywall went up....or wasn't there to begin with. If it is insulated like you say it should be as warm as the rest of the house regardless if there's a door. Way to many times the insulation is minimal or there is none. An insulated door won't help unless you heat the garage.
528488,torco,2010-12-14 21:43:00,656,"I have 70's side split and my daughters bedroom is over the garage and is cold. I have new doors on the garage but little to no insulation in the garage at all. I am looking to beef it up while I am on parental leave in January.  Its amazing how much of difference it can make, I am surprised with the insulation that it is still cold, I would think insulating the garage door would have to help."
528491,Twocoda,2010-12-14 21:48:00,4130,  im going to answer this for him......of course there is ..otherwise the local building inspector didnt do his job when the house was being built...the reason it should be sprayed is to act as a vapour/carbon barrier as well as R value ....this has to be in place prior to getting an insulation/vapour pass for your permit  Roy_ when you purchase your new door for your garage ..buy an insulated door with the  supports (for attaching your door opener to) installed inside the door...if your garage is insulated im going to assume ...the wallls are R 13 (2x4) then you should match the R factor to that ( R 13 Door) R value in a door is only as good as the walls surrounding it Top of the line Chamberlain door openers ( red ones) are the best on the market will run you around 400 bucks but well worth it ...the key pads will give you  garage temp/time and a few other tweeks If your garage has 2x6 walls then it is likely insulated  R 20 (could be R 24 but unlikely)...match that to the purchase of an insulated garage door of an R value 19...  regardless of the R value of the door it has to be installed correctly or you will be defeating the purpose...this includes sufficient down pressure from the door opener to seal the floor  Geoff- just a thought ...you might want to check behind the window trim of the cold rooms to  ensure there is adequate insulation ( moisture on windows is a tell tale sign)...unless its the actual floor that cold then you may have to open up the ceiling to ensure the duct work is sprayed and not just sitting in a bulk head to cool by the time the warm air is sent to the rooms in question..  personally when i come across a build with this situation ( side/back splits) the ceiling in the garage is sprayed to R 40 and if the duct work is in a bulk head ...its insulated to another R 20 then boarded...   For those thinking that a heater in the garage will solve the problems ..your going to want to ensure there is a vapour barrier in the garage for the exterior walls...moisture will form and create different kinds of problems..
528492,irishfield,2010-12-14 21:48:00,26272,"If you're going new doors... Garaga insulated, professionally installed with their triple seals. I believe all mine are R12 or 13."
528495,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-14 22:00:00,0, My point.sorry if I wasnt clear enough. Shoulda added...  to the beginning of my post. Inspectors??    We dont need no stinkin inspectors eh.  ..How bout contractors? Just because it was built by one doesnt mean squatt. Ive seen it where contractors board garages with no insulation and I've seen it where conractors remove insulation to put in the next 10 row houses for inspection Same house same amount of insulation.  ... Passing inspection....
528505,Twocoda,2010-12-14 22:22:00,4130," a garage isnt habitable space...therefore ...does not require insulation or vapour barrier except on the walls /ceiling that is a divider to habitable space( hence the reason i suggested to investigate the walls before heating )  those days of removing insulation out of a house and moving it over to the next building are loooooong gone ...in the 70s it was a big thing because HUDAK back then wasnt up to speed as they should have been ...with Tarion in place these days ...any builder would be a complete idiot to try something like that today...its because of these idiots of yesteryear that the process of a build is so stringent today (not a bad thing) ..even the ""geared to income "" housing units of today are overkill with Geo thermal heating/cooling (at HUGE expense to the tax payers) but in the long run ...i suppose it makes it easier for the people that have to live in them make ends meet without the big utility bills"
528509,tb4me,2010-12-14 22:32:00,3295,"Hi there.. I didnt read any other responses on this issue yet so im sorry if it has already been said. You need to cut a hole in the drywall of garage ceiling to determine what the issue is. Insulating your garage door will do nothing. I do these rooms over garages all the time.in fact im on my 4th this week alone. I have seen all the builders tricks. Im almost willing to bet they used r28 pink insulation with the vapor barrior insalled on the wrong side of the insulation.There will also no doubt not be any tuck tape on the seams of the vapor barrior.I have seen where the builders actually use your hard earned $ to heat the cavity between the floor joists to the drywall. Of course that wont work and all that does is waste energy, no matter how you heat. There also may be 1/2 pound foam. If its foam and white and you are able to make a snow ball like thing its no good. That foam is an ""open cell"" foam and air will travel right thru it. The only way (in my mind) is to remove all drywall and any insulation (including the 1/2 pound) on the ceiling and have Insta Insulation in to apply aprox 3 to 4 inches of 2lb ""closed cell"" foam. The nice thing about the 2lb foam is it is a vapor barrior.It may cost you a couple thousand dollars but you will never have a cold room above again. Please feel free to PMme if you wish further information. Hope this info helps! Now to go back and read past posts! Good luck to all with cold rooms over garages. There realy is only one way to fix them."
528510,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-14 22:34:00,0, Iwasn't suggesting to insulate the garage. Just said it wouldn't work with keeping the floor above warm if it wasn't.... Don't kid yerself with what contractors  and inspectors are capable of. 70's It was late 80's actually when it was done. Mattamy homes was one of them.
528522,tb4me,2010-12-14 22:48:00,3295,GBfisher is 100% right...I worked for Empire homes a few years ago. All I did was Tarion work. The problem were having today is these bigger builders are using sub trades for this type of work. They would think nothing to swap n skimp to save a few pennies. Been there done that had to deal with the miserable homeowners to get the t-shirt. Truse me insulation issues are NOT just a thing of the 70's. I do referal work for 2 different insulation comapnys. I go in remove garage ceilings and prep for the insulation. when insulation is complete I return and reboard. And yes you wll want all your duct work foamed over too! Again good luck
528529,GBW,2010-12-14 22:57:00,8460,I thank you ALL for the replies!  I will post pic's of the garage during the build of the house later.
528569,strik,2010-12-15 00:07:00,175,  WOW well said  so truth full .... Does anyone know what a builder has to pay to have a house on the tarion warranty program trust me you do not want to mess this up over 200 dollars worth of insulation.. not saying peole dont make maskates but this is unlikely.. TWOCODA please drop me a pm
