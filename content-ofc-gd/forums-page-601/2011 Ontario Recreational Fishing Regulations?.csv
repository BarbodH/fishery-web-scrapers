529449,GBW,2010-12-17 13:50:00,8460,ouch.  I feel for that other Geoff...
529696,Michael_Brown,2010-12-18 00:55:00,411,I really like what they have printed at the bottom of page 3 in the zone 17 section.
526609,canadadude,2010-12-08 23:48:00,769,"Thankyou for your agreement your definitly on the right side of the fence, lets all get together and make our Lake Ontario Steelhead fishery the greatest fishery world wide, the potental is there and I still think Lake O Steel is the finest Steel out there. I'll put lake O Steelies agaianst any other in the province, the next step is to get them to spawning sites and then we will have a truely inceridible fishery"
526639,Terry,2010-12-09 00:55:00,14456,I know little if anything about the steelhead there  is it a put and take fishery is it stocked is it all natural reproduction is it a mix  if guys are getting 25 fish to take home it sounds like a pretty healthy fishery  are numbers declining drastically  or is it you want to catch more the 25 fish and release them to be caught again  ...
526650,canadadude,2010-12-09 01:21:00,769,"It is not a put and take fishery, Steelhead have been desiginated a speceies of a reproductive species in the Great Lakes.The MNR along with other juisdictions has given Steelhead(rainbows) a jurisdiction above a put& take fishery, the rainbow fishery is now a desired species and reproduction is encouraged.It is a big bonus for lake ontario fishers to finally get a non native speceies not designated put& take!"
526660,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-12-09 01:30:00,1107,"I hope this is true about the steelhead limits and I REALLY hope Lake Erie's limits will be adjusted also I hate seeing 10-15 wild hens laying in the grass gilled, no one need 30-40lbs of trout half of it (from once a year charter clients )prolly ends up buried in the bottom freezer and eventually thrown out this is good news for the great lakes steel head even if they are just talking about it"
526662,canadadude,2010-12-09 01:41:00,769,"To be more clear is they want rianbow trout to be a self sustaing population unlike browns/salmon which would be a put& take fishery, although Atlantic Salmon, lake trout fall under the self sustaing window.The goal of the MNR is to restore our lakes to a 1800's type natural regeneration, not likely going to happen"
526664,timmeh,2010-12-09 01:42:00,609," Currently it is a mix of stocked fish and natural reproduction. In the Canadian tribs it's mostly wild fish that are returning. The core issue is that since it's stocked, some see it as a put and take. It still is a healthy fishery, but it could be much more and not as reliant on stocking.  As far as number go about 20 years ago the spring run in the Ganny was ~15000 fish. Now it's ~5000, maybe. As mentioned the Americans lowered their limits and supposedly the fishing has greatly increased since."
526666,canadadude,2010-12-09 01:49:00,769,"ya dude I know what your saying, don't worry though the american boys get on this crap , I was discusted by the killing fields I've seen over there, one of the reasons I don't fish the American tribs it turns into slauter feild over there. You boys think the Bronte is bad go to Oswego"
526667,Terry,2010-12-09 01:52:00,14456, thanks for the info
526674,vinnimon,2010-12-09 02:10:00,2593,"  Dropping the limits to two in both Lake O and Lake E tribs, now that I can go for! As for the lakes, a lot of good gents spend a lot of money on their boats, charters etc. If they dropped the lakes limit to 3 or4, that would be ok with me! There is one  eerie trib I love to hit in the early winter. But now I only C & R. It was a great fshery and within 15 yrs the trout numbers in that trib dwindled quit a bit. Enough to not even take a handfull of roe from a hen!"
526675,canadadude,2010-12-09 02:10:00,769,"The problem is we deal with  the MNR we are  not allowed to put fish, in the stocking area, the fishers have no say, Atlantics yes, Steelhead NO , untill recently it's a crazy MNR deal, try to pen salmon now it's a freaking MNR catastropy , I'm telling you to put 10'000 salmon in a pen and raise them right is like pulling teeth, in fact pulling teeth would be easier. Puting fish in a nice stable enviroment is a good idea then you meet the MNR"
526691,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-12-09 02:48:00,1107," Vinny the tribs have been 2 bows for a sport lisence and 1 for conservation for a few years now only brown and speckle remain a 5 fish limit but as far as the guys spend lots on boats and charters doesn't make any sence to me ,they will still be able to take 2 fish home if they choose to and thats plenty of fish IMO ."
526730,Twocoda,2010-12-09 05:10:00,4130,its been like that in the maritimes( atlantic salmon) for as long as i can remember...  the two bow was imposed on Lake Huron about 15 years ago i think ....yes it was an uproar for those boys that came from inland...but it has been VERY beneficial to our rainbow population that it is now BETTER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN!!!!!!!!!!.....its almost a rare occasion to catch a stocked fish...im all for the limit   As for the Charters and derby people ....you can still catch 5 fish a day ...2 trout ..three salmon etc.... learn to deal with it and in 15 years from now youll be thanking the fish gods for incredible outings...  personally ...i have never kept a single fish from Lake O and regardless of the limit on any species ...Never will
526922,ctranter,2010-12-09 21:48:00,543,At least Ontario taxpayers will save millions in the future from prevented health care costs
528820,GBW,2010-12-15 19:03:00,8460,Has anyone seen them yet?  The 2011 Reg's that is...
528822,skeeter,2010-12-15 19:09:00,1907,yes i have!!!!!
528823,GBW,2010-12-15 19:10:00,8460,Where?  Any changes to zone 17?
528825,skeeter,2010-12-15 19:19:00,1907,"now that i have yous attention     internet posting comes first, then the paper."
528828,skeeter,2010-12-15 19:22:00,1907,"its coming Geoff, its coming. just cross your legs so your water doesn't break. slow deep breaths, the contractions will pass."
528829,GBW,2010-12-15 19:22:00,8460,U
528830,GBW,2010-12-15 19:23:00,8460,"so, how's the FISHing been..."
529438,skeeter,2010-12-17 13:30:00,1907,"SEE,SEE i told you they would come,  now stifle about my fishin"
529439,GBW,2010-12-17 13:31:00,8460,I just went there and found them before I came here.
529441,skeeter,2010-12-17 13:34:00,1907,thats your story and your sticking to it right geoff?
529442,GBW,2010-12-17 13:40:00,8460,you got it Dann.  Is that a fish?
529446,irishfield,2010-12-17 13:46:00,26272,I heard from a good source that Geoff is allowed to fish 365 days a year without any worry of being violated by the MNR !
525876,GBW,2010-12-06 16:36:00,8460,"Hey all.  I was just wondering if anyone has seen the 2011 Ontario Recreational Fishing Regulations as of yet?  If anyone has please let me know when you found it, thanks.  Geoff"
525895,jedimaster,2010-12-06 17:22:00,3472,Not me.
525896,Ron,2010-12-06 17:25:00,1683,"To the best of my knowledge, the regs are the same as last year."
525903,kickingfrog,2010-12-06 17:31:00,8333,The MNR website still has the 2010 regs posted.
525908,GBW,2010-12-06 17:48:00,8460,That's why I was asking.  I've got the ice season itch and want to be sure what I can keep in the new year.
525916,vinnimon,2010-12-06 17:59:00,2593,"They will probably be out the same time as the card renewalls are available, at the bait shops. Another next week or so!"
525919,skeeter,2010-12-06 18:06:00,1907,im on the phone with them now. i will let you know as soon as i do. before the internet WE used a device called the phone
525921,Pigeontroller,2010-12-06 18:14:00,2793,I far as I know there will a new publication for 2011/2012
525922,skeeter,2010-12-06 18:15:00,1907,well that didnt take to long .....LOL  internet posting in the next week or 2. paper version at the end of the month.
525924,GBW,2010-12-06 18:22:00,8460,Thank you.
525933,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-06 19:07:00,3761, Wait by renewall you mean me buying my 2011 conservation license sticker? I always thought you had to wait until the 2nd of January to get the sticker
525976,timmeh,2010-12-06 21:45:00,609,Has anyone heard any rumors of any significant changes in the new regs?
525982,GBW,2010-12-06 22:04:00,8460,"Mike, when is your card due?  If you need a new card then do it online for 3-years.  Most places get the sticker before the new year so you can be legit for walleye opener on scugog."
526072,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-07 03:24:00,3761, 2012 it expires sadly. So this means I wait until the 2nd still?
526080,GBW,2010-12-07 03:51:00,8460,"nope, late in the month you can get a new sticker"
526122,canadadude,2010-12-07 13:23:00,769,I've heard rumour of Rainbow Trout limits being cut to 2 on Lake Ontario from 5
526149,hirk,2010-12-07 14:18:00,571,"2011 stickers and new card apps. will be available at retailers any day now,there should be a new reg. book as well."
526158,GBW,2010-12-07 14:41:00,8460,"Tks Dave. Mike, call Hirk's at the end of the week to see if he has the new sticker so you don't have to wait."
526201,fishermccann,2010-12-07 17:42:00,655,"I just recieved my new card ( 2011-2013) in the mail, it took only 6 days from sending in the fee on line.  Great service."
526320,chilli,2010-12-07 23:21:00,199,I heard the same thing.
526361,timmeh,2010-12-08 01:26:00,609, I'm sure that will cause a bit of uproar with the blue zone crowd. And the charters of course. I'd actually be quite surprised if that change was made.
526401,irishfield,2010-12-08 05:18:00,26272,"Well they had no problems killing the winter fishing businesses of Zone 11... so Lake O charters shouldn't been an issue either for them. If scientifics back the changes fine.. but Zone 11 was feed by cottage associations not wanting people fishing ""their"" lake when they aren't around..."
526420,canadadude,2010-12-08 12:44:00,769,"The change is already been done on the American side without an uproar, Biologists on both sides of the lake have noticed dwindling Rainbow populations hence the new limits are being discussed.Two Steelies per person is plenty, there is no need for the charters to slaughter 20- 30 rainbows per trip, if you want to fish the blue zone take time to catch & release."
526427,Billy Bob,2010-12-08 13:27:00,5865,"The way things are going I could see in the future that we will purchase tags for all game species, like deer..."
526508,timmeh,2010-12-08 18:24:00,609," I agree completely. Those pics with 25 fish layed out on the grass are disgusting. I'm glad it's being changed, just surprised I haven't heard more about it."
