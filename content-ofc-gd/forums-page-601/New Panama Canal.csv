529465,bigugli,2010-12-17 14:39:00,6138,"It depends on the style of container. Most of the container cars up here are either single or double loads only. I believe Transport Canada has stricter load guidelines. Moot point, regardless.  There are no rail lines running from Japan, China, europe, the middle east, etc... to continental North America. To OF's point, this mass container traffic speaks volumes about the loss of the manufacturing industries both in Canada and the States"
529505,bucktail,2010-12-17 17:03:00,1857,They are mulling over the idea of a Bering Straight Tunnel....wow
529526,Billy Bob,2010-12-17 17:57:00,5865, Moot......err yes and no.....many ships can stop on the west coast and then ship via rail to anywhere in continent....that saves them from going to NY or wherever to unload. I'm sure many are doing this.....  I don't know for sure but I doubt the US Navy would allow any aircraft carriers to cross the Panama Canal even if they could. Anyone have any first class knowledge on this ? ? ?
529528,Billy Bob,2010-12-17 18:00:00,5865, Step lightly as I carry a big stick. And it ain't no Ugly Stick...  MERRY CHRISTMAS  It's Bob not Billy..but I'm going to see my son Billy this weekend.
529531,lew,2010-12-17 18:12:00,12766, I don't know either Billy...or is it Bob ?? ...but I also doubt very much that the Navy would want a 1/4 mile long carrier stuck mid-continent between locks with all the whaco terrorist types just sitting waiting for such an easy target.
529538,mercman,2010-12-17 18:21:00,7054,  just remember Bobby (-----------this is not 8 inches---------)
529551,Billy Bob,2010-12-17 18:49:00,5865,But at least it's inches and not centimeters or whatever you guys use up there....
529576,bigugli,2010-12-17 19:34:00,6138,Sadly it is a risk the USN runs any time they visit a foreign port. It had happened back during one of their middle east interventions. Successfully bombing the USS Cole in the port of Aden in 2000.
529579,Twocoda,2010-12-17 19:45:00,4130, my wife thinks its 9
529066,Billy Bob,2010-12-16 13:40:00,5865,How many of you Great White Guys knew they are building another canal in Panama right next to the one that already exist.....it will accomidate 140 wide ocean vessels compared to the 110 ft canal they now have....they will dig 51 miles across the country AND lower a huge lake in 5 YEARS while we can't even break ground (over 15 years now) on a new Peace Bridge that spans a river you can almost throw a rock across...  It's BOB not Billy...
529074,Roy,2010-12-16 13:53:00,13728," No, you're Billy and Bob's your uncle."
529075,Headhunter,2010-12-16 13:54:00,5703,Or... Robert's your father's brother! HH
529078,skeeter,2010-12-16 13:59:00,1907," Bob's your uncle or aunt, depending on how good the operation went!!!!!!!"
529085,mercman,2010-12-16 14:09:00,7054,"i have an aunt Norman BB, maybe you could introduce your uncle to 'her'  Now back to the Canal  The economic impact of a new canal probably far out weighs the economic impact of the Peace Bridge. Simple as that.  Morning Bob,   BTW !!!"
529151,Billy Bob,2010-12-16 16:45:00,5865," ""IF"" your aunt had balls, she would be your uncle..."
529182,dobee,2010-12-16 18:08:00,301,"i was in panama for my honeymoon in may... it is an amazing place, the size of the mountains they are cutting down are unreal... basically they are taking the ""S""  bends out of the canal and making in straight..."
529193,mercman,2010-12-16 18:37:00,7054,  my uncle has them but he is still my aunt
529200,Billy Bob,2010-12-16 18:51:00,5865, Are you originally from one of our southern states like Ken Tuc where their mother is also their aunt and they met at a family reunion...
529243,bigugli,2010-12-16 21:30:00,6138,"The economic value of the Peace Bridge  is nothing but chump change compared to the traffic through Panama. In addition there is this huge historically strategic value of the canal that is key to the United States ability to contol the Western hemisphere. The ability to shift a major fleet from Atlantic to Pacific in 3 days is huge.  The other alternative is for the super ships to round the Horn, a passage not to be taken lightly, even today."
529276,Twocoda,2010-12-16 23:25:00,4130,  she did ...many of them over the years...just none belonged to her   wonder if they will name the canal Balboa crossing?  uh oh ...now this is getting X rated with such talk of balls and canals
529280,Billy Bob,2010-12-16 23:36:00,5865,WAY back when the Panama Canal was first under construction the French started the project....of course we had to step in after they quit and finish the job....
529284,OhioFisherman,2010-12-16 23:43:00,6623,"None of our aircraft carriers can go through the Panama canal, they currently have to go all the way around South America to deploy to the Pacific. For what the new canal will cost they could send a lot of trains across the US for a long time. If they need more aircraft carriers in the Pacific it could take more time to get them there the way it is now."
529289,bigugli,2010-12-16 23:51:00,6138," Like I said, the long way is by taking a trip round either Cape. Both trips are lengthy, and the Horn is nasty."
529292,mercman,2010-12-16 23:57:00,7054,  disease and the lack of cigarettes and beer forced the french to head back to the homeland BB. Don't ya know yer histry 
529295,Billy Bob,2010-12-17 00:03:00,5865," That is exactly what I was trying to teach the youngans here...this was copied and pasted from Wikipedia..  ""The concept of a canal near Panama dates to the early 16th century. The first attempt to construct a canal began in 1880 under French leadership, but was abandoned after 21,900 workers died, largely from disease (particularly malaria and yellow fever) and landslides. The United States launched a second effort, incurring a further 5,600 deaths but succeeding in opening the canal in 1914. The U.S. controlled the canal and the Canal Zone surrounding it until the 1977 Torrijos–Carter Treaties provided for the transition of control to Panama. From 1979 to 1999 the canal was under joint U.S.–Panamanian administration, and from 31 December 1999 command of the waterway was assumed by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of the Panamanian government"".  Much more good learning about this canal.........http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal"
529405,OhioFisherman,2010-12-17 04:46:00,6623,"Yes bigugli, I saw a program on TV about them taking a carrier from the east coast around the horn to the Pacific, it didn`t look like a fun time. They must figure China will get mad once they figure out we probably won`t be able to pay back the loans? LOL"
529415,bigugli,2010-12-17 05:48:00,6138,"Right through Nam, the USN rotated ships to Japan through the canal. In the Korean War, Canada also ran her carriers through there. If the United States Navy learnt anything from the RN it is this. A nation's economic and political interests are only as secure as a nation's ability to protect and assert those interests. Oil in Alaska and Venezuela are vital to the economic needs on the west coast.  On an economic note, super container carriers carry as much as 15, 000 containers. That is 60 long trains in one load."
529419,Billy Bob,2010-12-17 11:32:00,5865," TV Trains (trailer vans)that now have been converted to mostly carrying containers could ship 15,000 containers with about 30 to 37 trains."
529430,lew,2010-12-17 12:50:00,12766,"My dad spent 5 years in the Canadian Navy during WW11 working on the Atlantic & Mediterranian   until Germany surrendered. It was then decided to send ships, including Dad's, to the Pacific  to help with the fight against Japan. They went down thru the Panama Canal and up the west coast to San Diego where they were getting ready to cross the Pacific when Japan surrendered and they were then sent home again.  Dad often talked about the Canal and said it was unbelievable that something so amazing was built with the equipment available at the time."
529431,OhioFisherman,2010-12-17 12:54:00,6623,"""On an economic note, super container carriers carry as much as 15, 000 containers. That is 60 long trains in one load.""  Yeppers, and people wonder why the jobs are disappearing here? follow the tracks! It`s not unusual to see mile long trains here blocking the road with containers double stacked on them."
529435,bigugli,2010-12-17 13:22:00,6138,"  I forgot, the USN did learn the lesson quite well. Standard reading for midshipmen at Annapolis;  ""The Influence of Sea Power Upon History"" by A T Mahan, plus other texts extolling the same principles by the same author"
529436,Roy,2010-12-17 13:23:00,13728," Paul, I would have thought that seeing empty trains would have been a sign of disappearing jobs?"
529456,Billy Bob,2010-12-17 14:10:00,5865," How would you know if the container car is empty....I could tell but that comes with 30 years of experience working on the RR.  Container cars carry usually 4 containers but there are a variety of container cars.....TV or container trains will usually run from 100-120 cars...so that could be 480 containers in one train...15,000 containers divided by 480 in American math equals just over 31 trains...far cry from 60 trains. And somebodies has to keep contributing to my pension..."
529464,Roy,2010-12-17 14:35:00,13728,"Sorry Billy, didn't mean to step on your experience."
