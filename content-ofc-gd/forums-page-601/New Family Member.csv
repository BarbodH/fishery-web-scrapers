528883,Twocoda,2010-12-15 22:26:00,4130,good choice !!!! Zoey ( our dog) has never complained about her handle...and she actually comes when called ( a definite bonus)

527656,Handlebarz,2010-12-12 02:25:00,3790,When we got out Lab last year my wife was racking her head for a name she kept asking me what a good name was I just kept telling her to wait until we meet the dog we will get and the name will be right there with the dog and sure enough when she picked out our Lab the son of the breeder was looking at him and said with paws that big your going to be a BRUISER the wife and I looked at each other and sure enough it stuck so now Bruiser is alomst 100lbs and crashes everything just like his old man LOL.  That is a cute pup and I am sure he will make a great life long friend hope the name comes soon for ya.
527658,Leecher,2010-12-12 02:41:00,7832,Mike I have the perfect name for your pup.... Nemo

527698,solopaddler,2010-12-12 12:11:00,8605," Exactly how long did you leave Kenai alone?  Oh wow    German Shorthair Pointer    Actually Pepper was what we named our first german shorthair, go figure.    It was a hard choice. We went there thinking we'd definitely be choosing a solid brown pup,but this little girl just gravitated towards us.   Thanks for the kind words everyone. Those of you who have pets know what a big deal it is."
527701,Spiel,2010-12-12 12:21:00,9065," Names, gosh so many options. My brother had a dog named Flair/Flare, always liked it. I read somewhere once (long time ago) that dogs respond well to sharp sounding single syllable (?) names....."

She is a beaut...congrates on the addition..."
527785,misfish,2010-12-12 18:49:00,29133,"  Funny. Thats the name my brothers kids gave my Winnie ,before I got her from him. She was still a wee pup,so wasnt use to be called upon yet."
527788,solopaddler,2010-12-12 18:59:00,8605," Actually Coke is on our list. Pretty close.    That's a great point about the short form, thanks!"
