528702,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-15 13:16:00,10439,Last Day!!!! Don't forget to vote before noon Eastern for your vote to count!!!!!!
528771,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-15 16:36:00,203,"  Awwwww, poor little puppy  At least it was rescued....Can't believe that guy did that Grrrrrrrr"
528778,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-15 16:48:00,10439,"The fat lady is warming up her pipes and we are still down 1000 votes............doesn't look good at this point, but she ain't singin' yet. We have clawed back over 1000 votes since 8AM so anything is possible!!!!"
528787,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-15 17:08:00,10439,"Well we missed first place by 848 votes but we still have a good chance coming in second like we did. The top 30 go into the finals where the judges figure out how to divvy up the $1,000,000. So keep yer fingas crossed.  Final tally 1st place 43,869 votes, 2nd place (us) 43,021!!! A dang fine result I think!!! Thanks to all that helped out and I'll keep y'all posted on the final results."
528794,mercman,2010-12-15 17:20:00,7054,"We gave it our best, and had fun doing it too."
528795,solopaddler,2010-12-15 17:32:00,8605,"The good thing is, even if you lose you win.  They're all worthy causes."
528870,Twocoda,2010-12-15 21:46:00,4130,"Scoring criteria  The Judging panel will evaluate the 30 finalist ideas based on these criteria:  Impact  How deeply are people affected by this idea, and how urgent is the need? How many people will this idea benefit, and will it be compelling for a broad audience?  Likelihood of Success  How likely is this idea to be successfully executed in the short term?  Longevity & Sustainability  How long will the idea's affect last? Will it require regular funding beyond the initial request? If so, is there a plan to obtain additional funding?  Originality  How original is the idea?  Submission Quality  How much effort went into this entry? Was it well thought through and clearly explained?    Should be interesting to see how this plays out ..."
528889,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-15 22:53:00,10439,"  Should be indeed.  They have been getting all kinds of donations from local business as well. BHP Diamonds have donated $20,000 and another business in town has donated $11,000 to the cause. If that doesn't prove the whole town is behind this thing I don't know what will. For a city as small as Yellowknife to get that many votes and almost place first with onlt 18,000 residents amazes me. Sure we had a lot of help but per capita we had an average of over 2 votes per every person in Yellowknife during the semis while the first place finisher averaged about 0.5 votes per person. Pretty cool."
528891,solopaddler,2010-12-15 23:04:00,8605,  I think it's more a reflection of how powerful a tool the internet is.  Regardless things are looking up for the homeless animals in YK and that's a good thing.
528893,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-15 23:16:00,10439,  Mike If that is truly the case they must be on dialup in Brantford.

527849,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-12 21:47:00,10439,  We're gonna need a lot more votes. The second place idea is less than 600 votes behind now. They found a bunch of votes starting on Friday and at the rate they're closing they will pass us later today or tomorrow.

528411,Spiel,2010-12-14 16:54:00,9065,I still have a few votes left and will use 'em all.
528415,blaque,2010-12-14 16:59:00,2419,This may have been mentioned earlier in thread.........but this then goes to finals and starts again?  Surely 2nd place would get you to the finals?
528435,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-14 18:40:00,10439,"  Once in the finals all is up to the judges. They will decide how the money will be spent between the 30 finalists. I think we would be guaranteed winning only if we were to come in first over all. Last year they picked 9 winners, so there's always a chance we could get funding coming in second but they could hardly say no if the little town of Yellowknife got the most votes.  PS. We're back in the lead by 300 votes!!!! This is going to kill me!!!!"
528436,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-14 18:45:00,203,"  Wahooo, in the lead again   35665 votes  I've posted this on a few other forums that I'm on & quite a few people from there have been voting & passing it along to other forums  Also on facebook, some of my friends have shared it on their wall as well"

Yes they do some good work for abandoned or mistreated animals, but IMO any money they receive will only free up more money to oppose our favored past-times. Sorry I can not support the SPCA in any form. JMO: Rick"
525668,Twocoda,2010-12-06 00:30:00,4130, so what your saying is ...because you hunt and fish ...you do not support the conservation of  animals as a whole?...everyone is entitled to their opinion though  ...i know several Humane Society workers that eat meat ... based on your thinking ...they shouldnt even eat meat...

To say I don't not do not support the conservation of animals as a whole is inaccurate. To say I oppose the SPCA's version of ""support the conservation of animals as a whole"" would be correct.

520200,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-15 17:51:00,10439,"Yellowkinfe SPCA needs your help. We are trying to become one of the winners a contest put on by Aviva Insurance. In the NWT we really need a proper animal shelter for unwanted pets. In our bush communities when someone doesn't want their pet they are just taken to the dump and shot. To me this is unacceptable and I urge you to vote to help us make it into the next round. If we garner enough votes in this third round of voting to be in the top 90 we will make it into the semi finals where we will have to be in the top 30 to make it to the finals.  Please help me and our unwanted pets build a warm, safe and comfortable place for them.  You need to register to vote and you can vote once a day between now and Nov 25th.  Aviva Community Fund Contest"
