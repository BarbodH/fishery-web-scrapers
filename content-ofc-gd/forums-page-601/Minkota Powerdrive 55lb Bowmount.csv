It was bought new about 6 years ago and used VERY sporadically at my water access camp in QC.  Sporadically because we're off the grid and charging is a pain.  It's in great shape, works fine but is missing the mounting plate.  Any idea what this would be worth?  I have absolutely no clue and want to get rid of it.  PM's would be fine.  Thanks guys."
529127,Spiel,2010-12-16 15:44:00,9065,"I had one, brand new was around $750 (?) plus taxes and mounting plate was near another $100.  If it's mint I'd say $500.00 would be fair but I could be way off base."
529150,solopaddler,2010-12-16 16:44:00,8605,Well it's missing the mounting bracket..  I was actually thinking $300 firm. Anyone else have any thoughts?  Is that fair?  (edit: the bracket is on my boat which is being stored in Rouyn. I'll be able to remove it next spring)
529215,discophish,2010-12-16 19:41:00,392,"Very fair price for $300.  I have the same motor.  The plate costs about $100, and is not included with the motor anyway.  Shouldn't have any problem selling it.  I bought mine at the fishing show, and I think I paid $600+ back then."
529223,aplumma,2010-12-16 20:21:00,6896,You got my vote for a firm 300.oo if I were in the market for a trolling motor.  Art
529224,jimmer,2010-12-16 20:28:00,2730,I agree with the $300.
529267,HTHM,2010-12-16 22:53:00,4082,If it was stronger I would be over that like a wool blanket. I need 70 + pounds.
529270,grt1,2010-12-16 23:08:00,638,"I got a maxxum 72 pound thrust with a 60"" shaft that I wanted $325. for it and a local guy in Sioux Lookout offered me $200, but for that price I'll keep it as a back up incase the new motor I bought gives up the ghost. So I think $250 to $300 is a fair price."
529274,solopaddler,2010-12-16 23:16:00,8605,Thanks guys
529296,spinnerbaitking,2010-12-17 00:05:00,1622,I have a buddy that was looking for one but he's in Teeswater would that be delivered lol Richard
