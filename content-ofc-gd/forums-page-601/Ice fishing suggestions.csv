528130,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-13 17:29:00,203,"Alright I just started ice fishing a lot last year. Don't have a flotation suit but would like to get one. Anyone have suggestions where I can get a nice one, which brand, company, etc & what you use?  thanks in advance!"
528131,Terry,2010-12-13 17:33:00,14456,"I think it depends on your wallet  the cheap ones will float you and that is what they are designed to do  but I find the cheaper ones are stiffer, heavier, sweat more...the more you spend the more comfortable you will be IMHO  I like 2 piece over one piece...."
528138,Smarty Pantz,2010-12-13 17:53:00,203,"  Well, I'd be willing to spend anywhere up to $400 for a good one & I would definitely go for the 2 pc as well. True, you get what you pay for"
528182,skeeter,2010-12-13 21:43:00,1907,"i only go out after the hut operators have started. then i follow someone else's trail. like terry said "" if the trail ends STOP, and turn back"""
528216,phiphntek,2010-12-13 23:51:00,115,I have 2 piece Helly Hanson. I like two piece becuase most times I walk. You will heat up in one or 2 piece if you're walking. After setting up. I take off the jacket.Tough to do in a 1 peice
528239,robp,2010-12-14 01:48:00,11,Mix dryer lint with vaseline to create waterproof fire starting tinder that burns for a long time and ignites easily. Cotton balls can also be used instead of lint.
528260,BillM,2010-12-14 02:43:00,17367,Nothing keeps you warm like a 1 piece floater
528275,GBW,2010-12-14 03:33:00,8460,"Yes, but I may change to a 2 piece in a few years."
528340,sauce,2010-12-14 13:50:00,219,"I know that when I travel a long distance, I'm more likely to take risks (ie. Fishing on thin ice) ""I've come this far..."" I know that I'm like that, so my solution is to start my ice season at spots close to home. Its a lot easier to accept defeat when you're only 15 minutes up the road. I'll wait a couple more weeks to fish the really good spots. Gear tips! These will help increase the life of your auger blades. 1. Don't lend your auger to strangers. 2. Never bang the blades on the ice or use a hard object to chip ice off. 3. New blades will last a long time if you drill slow and steady. 4.Take note if your auger has offset grips. If so, use it properly so that the blades and flutes turn true... I've watched guys fight to get through 6"" of ice cuz they don't realize they're spinning it wrong. It wont ""bite"" and it wants to skip and wander. 5. Use a rag to dry off the blades and then put the cover back on it when not in use. 6. If you're fishing with a partner, work the auger together. You'd be surprised how fast and effortlessly 2 guys can crank an 8"" hole thru a foot of ice."
528341,sauce,2010-12-14 13:54:00,219,I've heard this before. I understand why you'd roll down your windows. But what's the reason for not wearing a float suit? It doesn't do me much good if I'm not wearing it.
528345,Headhunter,2010-12-14 14:03:00,5703,"I'm suprised that no one has mentioned this yet... GET A WHITE BUCKET!!!! Seriously, they will hold your catch, you can mount PVC pipe on the outside of the bucket and they will act as rod holders... don't forget your ice scoop... A great big thermos for your favorite hot beverage (don't cheap out on a thermos, buy 100% stainless steel and it will last forever. Here's a tip re the thermos... Fill the thermos with boiling water and let it stand in the thermos for 10 minutes, before you put your hot beverage of choice in... your bevey will stay hot for a lot longer. If your fishing  in a place where you can remove your float suit and be warm, be sure to turn your float suit inside out to dry out all of the condensation, before you go back outside. Same goes for your boot insoles. HH"
528419,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-14 17:13:00,2582," Agree with HH 100%. I take soup/stew alot so I use a wide mouth thermos. I get tap water as hot as I can and fill my thermos. While this is going on I boil a kettle of water. When its boiled, I dump the hot tap water out of my thermos and fill the thermos with my boiled water and screw the lid on. Then I heat up my soup or stew. When it is bubbling good I dump the boiled water out of my thermos and fill the thermos with my soup/stew. Sounds like alot of work but this is all done while I'm waiting for the coffee maker to make my mug of coffee for the car ride to the lake. I always pack extra fleece cloths and I wrap my thermos up in one of my sweaters to help hold in the heat longer. I have been out when it is -20 celcius in my unheated portable and the soup I poured in my thermos at home at 5AM is still too hot to drink/eat an noon. A slice of homemade bread and some soup sure hits the spot on a cold day on the ice."
528432,torco,2010-12-14 18:20:00,656,Thanks for the responses to my question on life jackets. Lots of good info being shared which great for all.
528439,cram,2010-12-14 18:50:00,1733, Ha!  Had never heard of that.  Awesome.
528701,splashhopper,2010-12-15 13:08:00,2931,"What about ""ice fishing"" line ?  Is there really a difference with them vs a light mono ?"
528720,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-15 14:36:00,0," thanks... i missed that question earlier. as stated, it's an awesome firestarter.  it's not an aggressive flame, and it lights very easily with a spark...  going through the ice 2 hours on snowshoe from the car requires a quick fire!"
529631,splashhopper,2010-12-17 21:55:00,2931,"re-posted to try for an answer .. please .  What about ""ice fishing"" line ?  Is there really a difference with them vs a light mono ?"
529642,adempsey,2010-12-17 22:13:00,1498," Many will tell you it's just marketing.  Personally, I am not convinced it's any better.  Often you get line in more visible colors like blue and yellow though.  However, I try new lines every season.  I have six different rods with six different lines at the moment, two of which are sold as ice lines (Fireline Micro Ice and Power Pro Ice).  If I didn't want to play around I would probably just use Trilene XT or XL, which a lot of people use for ice fishing."
529654,Roy,2010-12-17 22:36:00,13728,Go with Trilene XT and forget about the ice lines.
527803,splashhopper,2010-12-12 19:42:00,2931,"Ok, so this is just my second season that i am amped to go ice fishing.  There were lots of questions that I had last season, but damned if I can remember them this season.  So, I will start this thread with safety suggestions for some of the new people here this year that may be wondering about trying ice fishing too.  Please add safety tips and suggestions for the newbies for equipment and techniques as you see fit.   Here is the first suggestion     PLEASE DO NOT HI JACK this thread and derail it in to side conversations.  This topic might be common sense for some and not so common sense for others.  Thanks  Splashopper"
527806,GBW,2010-12-12 19:48:00,8460,"Float suit, ice picks and cleats are a must have."
527807,Nipfisher,2010-12-12 19:48:00,2449,Don't eat yellow snow.
527808,GBW,2010-12-12 19:49:00,8460,Oh and I have a rope with me too
527811,Roy,2010-12-12 19:58:00,13728,"And I'm the smallest guy here and I still won't go out on less that 12"" of ice. Sorry, there are just way better ways to die and that one is not one of the good ones. Please be and stay safe out there."
527812,Terry,2010-12-12 20:00:00,14456,if the foot prints end ....turn back
527841,tapout,2010-12-12 21:34:00,166,Have a larger friend come along and have him lead the way out.
527842,BillM,2010-12-12 21:36:00,17367,"A floater suit and a set of ice picks incase you go in..  Never cheap out on a floater suit, that's the only thing between you and death  And if you go in the water, don't panic and freak out.  Stay calm, get your pics and pull yourself out.  Gear can be replaced, you not so much."
527843,Rod Caster,2010-12-12 21:37:00,5784,"if I am worried at all, I will drill holes every 10 feet or so to make sure the ice is thick enough and consistent.... Just don't drill holes in a tight cirlce with you in the middle."
527854,uglyfish,2010-12-12 21:59:00,981,Get urself a spud. Test the ice as u go out!
527858,cram,2010-12-12 22:09:00,1733,"I'm with Roy.  I stay off until the ice is good and thick.   Ice may be 6 inches where you measure it, and then be much thinner in an adjacent area where there's current, thicker snow, a sprinng, etc.   Why kill yourself?"
527860,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-12 22:13:00,2582,"Safety. Good topic.  1. I would suggest a good floater suit.  And ice pics. 2. Early ice, late ice or areas you are not familiar with...don't go alone. 3. Early and late ice...take a spud...and use it. 4. Flashlight/lantern if you are coming on or off in the dark. 5. Dress to stay warm 6. Take a compass/GPS. White outs or thick fog is scary...trust me on this. 7. Sunglasses and sun screen. Worst sunburn I ever got in my life was on a sunny day on the ice in February.  I hope everyone has a safe season on the hardwater."
528061,addy79,2010-12-13 14:25:00,573, huh???
528066,BillM,2010-12-13 14:32:00,17367, I guess you don't ice fish
528068,addy79,2010-12-13 14:39:00,573," I've gone a few times, but no idea what a ""spud"" is...  please advise"
528069,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-13 14:45:00,2582,A spud is generally a steel pole or bar with a sharpened end like a chisel. You give the ice a real good whack with it every few steps. If you go through before 3 real good whacks...GET THE HELL off the ice.
528071,addy79,2010-12-13 14:49:00,573,"ahhhh, i see...  I was expecting an ingenious way of using a potato to gauge ice thickness   LOL  good to know"
528073,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-13 14:55:00,0,"if you can afford a floater suit, they are ideal...  i however cannot!  what i do have is ice picks as discussed, and each member of my party typically has a 25 ft min. length of rope.  i also bring waterproof matches and a small ziploc with dryer lint/vaseline for waterproof firestarting gear...  once on the ice, watch for creek mouths, air holes/springs, and any other obvious disturbances on the ice surface."
528075,addy79,2010-12-13 14:57:00,573, can you expand on that?
528077,BillM,2010-12-13 15:03:00,17367," Dryer inlet guards whatever you are trying to light on fire from the wind, but an be opened a bit to provide oxygen to the fire if needed.  Vaseline keeps your skin/lips/whatever from getting wind burn/chapped, etc."
528079,addy79,2010-12-13 15:08:00,573,thanks
528090,torco,2010-12-13 15:51:00,656,"For people that don't have floater suits either because of cost or because they don't ice fish regularily enough to justify. Would wearing a life jacket over your winter coat be a good comprise?  Sorry if its a silly question, I went ice fishing about 4-5 times last year but don't have a floater suit or jacket."
528095,Terry,2010-12-13 15:59:00,14456," I would wear it under my winter coat  but sure, it will stop you from going under but will not help keep you warm while trying to get back out anything is better then nothing"
528099,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-13 16:06:00,2582,I ice fish ALL the time. In fact I enjoy it as much as summer fishing. At the time my current floater suit is PAST worn out...it probably would not even float someone half my weight...so it is useless for that. I am currently looking at replacing it with ICE ARMOUR which is bib style pants and a jacket that has no floatation properties at all.  With regards to a floater suit... I always suggest one. However if you take all the proper precautions I really don't think they are necessary.  I am a walker though. I would strongly  recommend a floater suit if you are taking a sled or ATV or your truck/car on the ice. When you are traveling at faster speeds then you can walk...the chances of getting in trouble before you know it...go way up.  As far as life jackets go. Outside of looking silly...they might be a good idea if it eases your mind...but I am unsure on there effectiveness in winter conditions...cause I don't know if they would help or hinder you actually being able to get out of the water if you did indeed go through the ice.  Bottom line for me is use common sense. In over 25 years on the ice I have not even got a wet foot...and I plan on keeping it that way.
528128,miller,2010-12-13 17:28:00,223," i've only got one ice season under my belt and ive gotten a few wet feet, but thats just because i didn't notice my friends frozen over hole, DOH!  lol"
