I just had the link e-mailed to me and had to share.   http://www.wreg.com/videobeta/?watchId=8ba6f8fc-90a2-4711-90ea-1884ec348310  I knew it wouldn't be long before someone found a way to do something like this.  It's a bit scary.

528939,Dave Bailey,2010-12-16 01:43:00,1641,"It's possible, but as yet it's not as bad as some think. Snopes has a piece on it here."
528946,Handlebarz,2010-12-16 02:08:00,3790,Our FAST cards for crossing the boarder has the same thing but they come with a sleeve that keeps a signal from getting out and can not be scanned when you have it inside the cover.
528954,fishing n autograph,2010-12-16 02:18:00,2540,glad i don't have pay pass.......doubt mastercard would give  me any more credit without their system crashing
528982,irishfield,2010-12-16 03:02:00,26272,"You don't need to have paypass..the chipped cards do it without having to enter a pin number. Leah found that out at No Frills here a couple weeks back when the check out gal grabbed her chipped mastercard and held it up to a sensor and ding..ding.. with no pin entry. What's the point of these ""great"" cards... no signature.. no  pin needed.. anyone can steal your card and use it anywhere with tap and go."
529016,GBW,2010-12-16 04:00:00,8460,A whole new meaning to that right there...
529017,fishing n autograph,2010-12-16 04:01:00,2540, I knew a few girls like that back in the day.....
