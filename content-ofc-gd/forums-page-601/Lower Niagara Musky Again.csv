529064,Aaron Shirley,2010-12-16 13:33:00,655,"I spent the last frosty day of the musky season trolling the lower Niagara River with Louis (aniceguy) in the hopes to get a nice musky over 40 inches. It was very cold out at -10 with a 20k plus wind from the NW. It's a good thing that we were protected a bit from the wind on the lower river Ontario shoreline. We trolled our butts off and cleared lines from debris constantly to no avail. We took the big skunk, a typical outing for the lower Niagara River. It is one tough musky fishery! I really wanted to hit the upper Niagara for a better chance at a nice musky, but with the high winds and -10 temps, we opted to fish in a little more comfort while being protected with the walls on the lower river. Oh well, we gave it all we could muster. Those upper river muskies will have to wait until next year now.  FYI the lower river was quite dirty with about 1.5 feet of vis. I could barely see my prop.  On to steelhead now!!!  Good fishing,  Aaron"
529279,Rod Caster,2010-12-16 23:33:00,5784,Nice try man. You sure like a challenge. Good luck with the steelies.
529311,Handlebarz,2010-12-17 01:21:00,3790,Hey Aaron at least you got out again that would have been more fun then working all day best part about today is there is one less day until 2011 season.
529433,corvette1,2010-12-17 13:22:00,1765,"you can't catch them if your not out there you guy's put in a full day it's tough enough in clear water much less dirty, it's not easy to catch ski's in the lower i got a nice one last year fishing for steel"
529469,rides85,2010-12-17 14:53:00,37,"Good to hear you got out on the last day of the season, My boat has been put away since late october. Its gonna be a long winter till the 3rd weekend in june"
529606,Rizzo,2010-12-17 20:52:00,4754,"you didn't miss much on the upper. I was out there last Saturday and visibility was around 10 inches! We tried to bonk one on the head for a couple of hours, then decided our time could be used more wisely so packed it up early and got the boat winterized."
529664,Leecher,2010-12-17 23:08:00,7832,Kudos to you and Louis for giving it all you got considering the below temps and nasty winds Leechman
529668,aniceguy,2010-12-17 23:15:00,1094,"That river never ceases to amaze me, Aaron knows it like the back of his hand, looking forward to more eye opening days on it.  Cold was an understatement, the tough part was us both resisting the obvious tempation roe in a pocket lol"
