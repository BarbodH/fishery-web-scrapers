Most car dealers are now giving 'FREE' winter tires when you buy a new vehicule.Of course we know that the cost is hidden in the price."

I can still remember getting in the car after it sitting for a number of hours and start driving away. The car would shake so bad from the flat spots; that you had to shut the ashtray or all the cigarette butts would be jumping out like popcorn. After 4 or 5 miles the tires would warm up and round out again. LOL Looking at today’s tires I can’t believe we accepted that, that was the best they had. Can you imagine; you’re in your brand new $2500.00 (Yes the decimal is in the right place LOL) Buick LaSabre and you turn to your buddy and say.

529487,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-17 15:26:00,0,"  The 400 is made of more cement then asphalt and I would assume that the roads up north are also. Even America roads are made of mostly cement(if I heard correctly).  I always wondered why they didn't make the 401 more cement based. EIther its to keep the asphalt people in business or its because the 401 sees the most traffic?????  The Asphalt is definetly a smoother drive but in the summer in a traffic jam due to road repairs, and in the winter snow(less traction), it doesn't make much of a difference.   1) I think its obvious they would do damage.  2) Because of too many irrresponsible drivers, sometimes the government has to step in, to keep people safe from these individuals and themselves.  3) Price gouging is part of the Capitalist system, and the government doesn't mind because more price gouging equals higher tax revenue for government.  4) I highly disagree that the difference between A/S and winters is minimal.  Never mind cross border shopping.We should get our tires made in China. $10 a tire.lol  What are your ideas to stop accidents from happening cookslav? And stop the insurance companies from continually raising rates(your paying for snow tires without actually getting any)? Which does not bring back the dead.....  Maybe we should get an insurance break for having snow tires. What do you guys think?"
529492,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-17 16:07:00,10439," Dan The new radial tires still turn square in the cold, it just needs to be colder. Any time the temps dip below -30 to -35 radials exhibit the same problems only not as bad and not as long as the old bias ply tires did. Mine were square for most of last week!!!! Not this week though now that we are receiving tropical temps approaching minus single digit temps."
529493,DRIFTER_016,2010-12-17 16:17:00,10439, The reason less concrete is used is due to several facts.  1/ Asphalt is more elastic and does better with freeze/thaw cycles.  2/ Asphalt is cheaper to use than concrete.  3/ Concrete is eaten away by salt.  4/ It takes longer to install concrete than asphalt.  5/ Conrete takes longer to cure before it can be put in service.

529563,jedimaster,2010-12-17 19:06:00,3472,"ABS Brakes and a new set of All Seasons will stop you no probelm in the winter. I have a Camry with ABS and All Seasons and a Corolla with Blizzaks and the Camry stops better on ice and snow. Cornering and initial traction are better on the corolla though. Would the Camry stop better with Snow tires, more than likely yes, but I drive within the conditions, leave space between me and front of the car, test the road conditions frequently by applying my brakes when its safe to do so.  I am not saying Snow tires are not worth the money, but it really needs to be justified as to where you live, and how much driving you do. If you stay in the GTA and you dont drive much than a new set of good All Seasons are probably gonna be fine IF you drive within the conditions you have. One of the conditions is the type of tires you have.  People tend to over drive the conditions, be that snow, ice, Vehicle options, Tire type etc....  This is why we see so many SUV's in the ditch, they can go but can't stop, so people don't realize it until they are sideways in a ditch.  Snow tires are great and find their way onto every car I own eventually in the winter, but to blanketly say AS tires are not appropriate is false.  If you are getting some New AS tires in the winter find the softest ones with deep and widely spaced lugs. Or do what I do, and buy a set of used snows and run them into the ground, whil you save up for a new set."

529580,DanD,2010-12-17 19:52:00,2223,  ABS brakes do not stop you and better then a non ABS vehicle. ABS will allow to steer the vehicle in a panic stop; because the wheels are not locked. In other words; if you’re in a panic stop heading towards a block wall; without ABS you’re going to hit the wall wherever. With ABS you’re still going to hit that wall but you’ll be able to pick the spot you’re going to hit. LOL  Dan.

529591,jedimaster,2010-12-17 20:15:00,3472,"On Ice and Snow, it does stop better. not sooner. Better. Stopping is not just comming to a stop its maintainin control of the vehicle. With loose conditions like gravel, sand, Snow non ABS will dig in better. But non the less ABS will still give you better control.  If you need to stop sooner drive slower. If yo uneed to brake in an emergency and react with steering, ABS is by far better.  "
529592,jedimaster,2010-12-17 20:17:00,3472,I still think the best thing is to have a 6 inch steel spike on everyones steering wheel.  Everyone would drive safer. I think this would prevent far more accidents than ABS or Snow tires combined. It may have some unintended consiquiences like natural selection though.

529281,cuzza,2010-12-16 23:38:00,467,"I'm a big fan of Michelin, have X-Ice for winter and Pilot Sports for summer and both are great, not sure what the do all season-wise though. They are more expensive but last longer so you'll have more useful tread for next winter.  Motomaster are CT own brand right? Your tyres are your only contact with the road so I wouldn't skimp on them especially as you're asking them to do a job you should really use two different types of tyre for."
529283,Billy Bob,2010-12-16 23:42:00,5865, Years ago we all has our snow tires on extra rims but now we have to have tire sensors in each rim so the cost is prohibited at $100 or more per tire sensor.......

It took a law forcing me to buy winter radials for me to really see the difference.and I DO really see the diference in traction and ability to manouver safely.It really is like night and day.If you have never tried both, you can not know the dif i'm talking about.

529333,mercman,2010-12-17 01:56:00,7054,"  Good question, I'll get back to you on that. They interviewed a few of the truckers involved in the stranding this week. all say they would not have had a problem with road conditions had it not been for motorists who had lost control. Also police said that they had baracaded the highway, but people were removing the barricades and kept on going down the highway. Thats totally nuts !!!"

Local delivery services like puro ups etc, must have dedicated winter tires on thier trucks in Quebec."
529345,SlowPoke,2010-12-17 02:32:00,2984," Obviously a truck accident is more likely to involve a road closure than a car accident. No, trucks do not require snow tires in Quebec.  Back to the topic... I would not recommend Motomaster SE. I had SE's and LE's on two different vehicles and I wouldn't waste my money on them again. For that matter, I wouldn't risk my money on any Motomaster tires. Poor wet/snow traction and suffered from shifted belts on both brands. I've had good luck with Cooper A/S as a low value tire on the van. On my Suburban, I switched from Michelin's to Toyo Open Country's and while the traction is good, extremely poor fuel economy and wandering is a major turn off. I regret not staying with Michelins I wish I could offer a brand/model specific to your application but it's been a while since we had a small-midsize car. I would look for something on tirerack.com with excellent wet weather reviews. Tread clearing be it water or snow is the key to good traction. You don't necessarily need an aggresive tread pattern to achieve this."

The modern day winter tires with softer rubber compounds, 1000's of sipes and better lug designs just bite into the snow or grip the ice better and get you where your trying to go. Even the old snow tires were FAR superior than summer tires.  I've owned everything from Corvairs to Rivieras to 4X4 pick-ups and jeeps and I've used snow or winter tires on every vehicle I've ever had. Back in the day most vehicles were rear wheel drive and we only put snow tires on the rear with sandbags in the trunk. It helped with traction but steering was poor until someone came up with the idea of using 4 snow tires, even on 2 wheel drive vehicles and that made a HUGE difference.  Over the years I've either driven or been a passenger in far too many vehicles in the snow and ice without winter tires and there's  absolutely no  comparison.....no matter what some folks say.  I purchased a new 2010 F-150 Super Crew 4X4 this year  that came with 18"" Goodyear Wranglers that may be great in the snow....or not....but I still went out a couple weeks back and bought 4 dedicated winter tires & rims for the snowy season.  Lots of extra $$$$ and the grey steel rims aren't nearly as purty as my OE chrome wheels, but in my opinion it's $$$$ well spent.  Every day it seems I get held up behind some guy who can't get traction in the snow or ice with his All Season Radials, even though he probably thinks winter tires are for wimps....or is it wussies"

Some of the larger retailers may still have in house stock on them? But the 205/65R15 is still a popular size and its over-all diameter is only .3” (point 3 of an inch) taller and .5” narrower; you’d never feel the difference. It sells about $10.00 cheaper.   Dan.

They do not track well in rain and snow in particular even though I was told that they were good. I have always been happy with Michelin, but not this time. I drive a Mazda 6 dedan. Fish_Fishburn was simply asking for opinions on which all season tire was the best and went into detail on why he does not want winter tires. I don't understand why so may people replied with their opinion on why he has to buy winter tires? There seems to be many people on this board these days that take over threads with their own opinions that completely side-track the posts. The guy asked a simple question and does not need a lecture as I've seen in many other posts. It really brings down the quality of the board in my opinion."

Crews will use salt, sand or a combination of the two depending on the forecasts and road conditions. All impact the environment to varying degrees and ways.

529203,Raf,2010-12-16 18:54:00,3495, Seems a lot of people like the silent armours.  They are well reviewed.  For me they are just not aggressive enough for mud/off road like the duratracs are while retaining the snowflake rating.

The problem with studs are pot holes.When the tire flex's it like to throw studs. The studs would chew out the pot hole worse, And ,of course you can't get away from the billions of pot holes there are by the end of the season from the plows ripping off the frost heaves.   If you don't run your A\S in salt and sand season you will get 120k Kms or more out of them. Tire science today is a art form.If you believe there is no difference. I say LOL.

529057,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-16 13:19:00,0," You know how long I have been thinking about this in regards to tires? That safety is compromised for profits(yes Bill, that is capitalism). Snow tires(tires in general) are over priced. Maybe because they dont sell enough of them. If they sold more, then the price should come down. But shouldn't they bring the price down FIRST, so people are persuaded to buy? No they would rather make less, charge more.  Just like those little Life jackets that cost over $100........  The majority of accidents on the roads are due to bad tires. Whether they are deflating(loosing air), bald(The owner cant afford new ones),ect.....  I say if you can afford them, buy Snow tires. And I say they should lower the price on snow tires. How much does a set cost in America Bill?  Anyways. I hear Michelin tires are good. Just remember. You get what you pay for. The more expensive they are, the better they usually are. In regards to durability, but not always for snow traction. Most A/S tires do not handle heavy snow fall, well.....  This thread wont get locked unless our expert snow driver from the Sue joins in again, and tells us of his superior driving skills.LOL"

Apparently there are studies to confirm this....By CAA, and AAA Who sell tires, and offer storage for your All season radial   I'll echo that,  I Guess chains don't work well enough for our governments Only expensive solluions Here  Hey I won't knock them till I try them, even though I have had NO issues with my all seasons. But that being said I don't like the idea of Being Mandated to buy these tires while the Government refuses to issue a tax credit to help.

529060,pikehunter,2010-12-16 13:26:00,1659,"We have far too many rules and regs for the cops and courts to deal with as it is. Adding this to the books won't help.  I still maintain it's not so much the type of tread but the way one drives. Common sense and the realization that it's snowy and icy makes a world of difference as well as the cars steering and brake condition. Guess it's easier to pass a new law than it is to teach people how to drive. Not saying they don't help but common sense is always good.  I drove an Aerostar, rear wheel drive only, for 13 years. Never had a snow or winter tire on it, ever. Was it tricky to drive? Sure at times but skill and awareness kept me out of dumb situations and the fact I always had decent all seasons on it and 100 pounds of sand in the rear end. Usually replaced the tires in the fall of the year when needed.  The present car is a front wheel drive with new Continental all seasons on it, so far it handles fine, I may consider winters next season, I'll see, but then again so far this year the Hammer hasn't seen enough snow to complain about. The kid on the other hand needed new tires and put a set of 4 cheap winters on his front drive Cougar, he says it handles great! Mind you I've never heard of HiFly tires before, but the tire shop convinced him they were just as good as the brand name and he is happy."
529067,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-12-16 13:41:00,0," Or is it because the chains destroy our ashphalt roads??    I don't think the government should mandate them either, but something definitely has to be done. Too many accidents,too many people dying too early. Sure many are from careless driving. But others? I think making tires more affordable would save lives(and cause less accidents).  Doesn't mater how good you think you drive. All it takes is someone behind you to rear end you and send you flying."

Anything 'car' related has become a necessity in this world, so they dont have to lower the price at all. we are slaves to our vehicules. Dont get me wrong, loads of us abolutely need a car or truck to make a living, but why do people living in dowtown major cities use a car to get to work? They could walk faster then the traffic they cause doing this.  in Canada, we LOVE our cars, and will defend our choices of vehicules, tires, gas, DRIVING SKILLS, and even the types of fluids they use. Like the commercials says  Hold on there....this aint no romance novel. It's just a sweet potatoe !!!! A car is a car is a car. Transportation, not an extension of our peepees IMHO"

Those people who have never tried good winter tires and say that all seasons are good enough do not know what they are talking about. I was one of those people as well. If you don't try them you'll never be a believer. As for spending the money on new tires and rims for snow tires, deal with a reputable tire shop, buy them, and if you buy a new vehicle, go back to the tire shop and they(most of them) will gladly give you trade in value for those that are only a year old, provided that there is still decent tread on them. There are always people looking for the same size tire and rim that you have on your vehicle. The nordic tire from good year is a good tire. NEVER COMPROMISE SAFETY FOR A FEW DOLLARS."

I Guess their roads are stronger  I don't believe either of us are old enough to have seen the day where Chains and Studs were allowed, so I guess we've never seen the damage they cause either, but it makes sense.  I just find it funny that its ok for the government to mandate a safety Product that ""I"" have to pay for when I'm not sold on it as being necessary while sitting here contemplateing a Cost efficient alternative. Sure it is deemed destructive by the same governmental Institution, but there are no public studies made available to suggest chains are destructive nor that Winter tires are necessary other then marketing collateral designed by companies that stand to Gain from the sale/storage of Tires.  And that Tough little pill becomes even harder to swallow when the same government that wants to make it Mandatory, While not providing statistical analysis, wants to maintain the current ban on Chains, and Studs while ALSO refusing to issue a Tax credit to consumers, NOR do they have any intention to tackle the apparent price gauging....I wonder if anyone is thinking about Billy’s comment about Cross border Business?  That’s not only a tough jagged pill...its down right sharp And for a guy like me who has no issues with the All season tires its just a bit much.  If the government wants to make it manditory so be it, But they need to Provide assistance for Low income families, Tax credits to the average Joe. And some official studies(not branded) made avaialble for public education would be ideal. No one wants a cost rammed down their throats.  Not to be an ass, but For every pro, there is an Anti... I know 2 mechanics who say the tires are ok, but between a set of BRAND NEW All seasons and Winter the difference is minimal. The real difference is when Joe Blow replaces his 4 year old radials with a brand new set of Winter tires....that will be an obvious improvment."

It is a directional tire with (like its name) three different tred designs in one tire. This tire has the snow flake designation as well; allowing it to be used if Ontario ever does bring in the snow tire law. They also have a 130,000klm tred life warranty; plus a $60.00 mail-in rebate on a set of four tires.  Dan."

I have never had snow tires before and have done pretty good with just all seasons. My..what did we do before they invented snow tires. Thanks Skeeter I will check kijiji out and see whats there. Snow tires won't save your life if you drive like a jackass. Just my opinion. Defensive driving and giving yourself more time to get to your destination in the winter will. What about the Motomaster SE someone was telling me they are a good all season tire with an agressive grip and do well in the snow?

529132,mercman,2010-12-16 16:00:00,7054," Just remember, its not the grip of the tire thats the most important. its the tire structure.Winter tires are constructed for winter conditions specifically.Softer rubber, deeper more jagged tread patern steel belts in different configuration.All season are ok for temps above 5C."
529140,POLLIWOGG,2010-12-16 16:17:00,835,I think studs are legal everywhere but Ontario but I might be wrong. They did studies that showed modern studs don't damage the road but the MTO can't agree on anything or admit being wr-r-r-ong.
