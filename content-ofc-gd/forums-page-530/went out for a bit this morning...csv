589921,Squid,2011-06-05 14:05:00,1656,Nice fish Randy!! never fished Tomiko lake.
589926,Muskieman,2011-06-05 14:24:00,2472,
589942,Handlebarz,2011-06-05 16:27:00,3790,Randy if we get back up there I will call ya before we head up for sure. Last time I was there it was busy as all hell down there and hard to launch. I would not want to be a un skilled person trying to launch there on may 24 weekend
589968,splashhopper,2011-06-05 19:36:00,2931,"  I hear ya Randy.... here is the one that i ""thought"" I had the sign in >>    "
589971,Joey,2011-06-05 19:55:00,9122,"Well there's quite a bit of a difference between his sign and your sign Splashhopper.  All yours says is 20.  As I said, if you want to make a formal complaint, go ahead and it will be voted on.  We already have a 26 inch pickerel anyhow so this will only add 1/2 inch to our team.  Nothing worth crying over."
589973,Joey,2011-06-05 20:03:00,9122,what was wrong with this one Splash?????  
589974,splashhopper,2011-06-05 20:09:00,2931,   Ooops  wrong pic  
589976,Leecher,2011-06-05 20:15:00,7832,Good going Randy   Love the dark colors on that one Quality gold Thanks for sharing Leechman
590000,Roy,2011-06-05 21:29:00,13728,"Beauty fish Randy, congrats!"
590001,irishfield,2011-06-05 21:32:00,26272,It's alright Joey... we all know what year it was in the picture by the size of Randy's stomach !!
590006,Spiel,2011-06-05 21:57:00,9065,"Well if I have to interject and I will, your fish is ""golden"" Randy as it's quite obvious we didn't have a ""Team 5, 5cale Bu5ster5 last year.  Nice, very nice Tomiko walleye Randy, end of debate!"

590125,SlowPoke,2011-06-06 03:28:00,2984,"  Ron, if you have issues with a tournament entry fish; take it up privately the poster, team captain or tournament organizer. Please don't hijack someones report.  Randy, nice fish! Thanks for sharing."
590203,johnnyb,2011-06-06 13:41:00,3413,"Great fish, Randy....to be honest, I've never heard anything good about the fishing on Tomiko.  Or maybe I'm just thinking of the icefishing....hmmm....crown land sites eh?"
589494,Muskieman,2011-06-03 17:30:00,2472,"I left home after dropping the kids off at school... made the 15 minute drive to Lake Tomiko...  The water was like glass and not a cloud in the sky except for the one that contained all the Blackflies.  I knew it was gonna be tough...  I managed to miss about 5 and land one ...   26.5""     If the clouds roll in tonight I'll be going back  Randy "
589497,g_clot,2011-06-03 17:36:00,104,That's one dark coloured walleye.  Nice pic.... no pun intended.
589498,kickingfrog,2011-06-03 17:44:00,8333,Nice fish! That's a dark fish for Nipissing (I'm assuming).
589500,Muskieman,2011-06-03 17:48:00,2472,  Tomiko
589501,kickingfrog,2011-06-03 17:49:00,8333,And that is what you get for asumin'.
589503,corvette1,2011-06-03 17:50:00,1765,nice eye
589524,Muskieman,2011-06-03 18:24:00,2472," Here are another 2 Walleye from Tomiko .. they're pretty dark too.. I've never seen a light colored one from there yet been fishing it for 35 years. 33.75"" & 34.5""  "
589555,Rod Caster,2011-06-03 19:16:00,5784,"those are some big fishies Randy! Well done sir, well done."
589569,Joey,2011-06-03 19:58:00,9122,Nice on Randy  Great job on showing them blackflies who's boss
589599,beginner,2011-06-03 21:16:00,542,"good lookin walleye... love the first pic, look like a baazooka!... (canon)"
589761,Joeytier,2011-06-04 16:53:00,3990,"Nice goin, Randy.  Yesterday was slow for me as well up on Marten (only managed one), but whacked 'em good early this morning before the winds picked up."
589768,Handlebarz,2011-06-04 18:07:00,3790,assBAG comes to mind when I here of people fishing Tomiko.   I only say that in envy of you living so close to there I sure do miss heading up to Tomiko it is a great place with many memories there for dad and I.  Great read Randy
589790,Mike01,2011-06-04 19:42:00,378,"Is the water darker on Tomiko, that could explain the colour..?"
589812,Muskieman,2011-06-04 22:15:00,2472," Yep .. exactly.. Tomiko is mostly pond water therefore a lot of tannins and has a reddish tea stained color.. It's main tributaries are the Tomiko River and Mosquito Creek which are both fed mostly by ponds..that may also explain the elevated Mercury levels..  according to ""Guide to Eating Ontario Sport Fish 2011-12"" Tomiko has a limit of 4 & 2 safe Walleye meals/month... vs Temagami at 8.. and Nipissing at 8 & 4."
589841,Grimace,2011-06-05 01:05:00,2020,"A real nice specimen.  Well done.  Did you jig her up? Or were you trolling?   In the shadow of your fishing line on your rod it looks like a split shot.  I am on my phone though, could be a jig."
589846,mercman,2011-06-05 01:17:00,7054,"Nice I'm going out for them tomorrow. Was out this morning, and i got them figured out now. Kept a close eye on the locals."
589849,Muskieman,2011-06-05 01:25:00,2472,"  slow vertical presentation..1/4Oz Northland Firetiger Fireball jig ,2"" VMC clip-on blood red treble trailer baited with a Dew-Worm in 20or so FOW.  Randy "
589853,Grimace,2011-06-05 01:36:00,2020,Great.  I love getting them on a jig.
589895,splashhopper,2011-06-05 10:38:00,2931,nice looking walleye.....  bummer about the OFC sign... no year in the pic
589897,Handlebarz,2011-06-05 11:19:00,3790,"Randy do you launch at the public one? And is it always busy with people camping there?  Here are a couple that dad and I got  dads 27 1/2""   even the dinner ones are dark   the Smallies were also dark "
589900,Joey,2011-06-05 11:47:00,9122," Uhhh, not sure what your point is here.  For the effort it looks like Randy took to get that beautiful specimen of fish in a picture with an OFC tourny sign I think that pic is quite acceptable for an entry.  Take it up with the board of directors privately if you want to question it!!!"
589907,splashhopper,2011-06-05 12:22:00,2931," Yes, it was a beauty fish.... no questions asked..  Two years ago I made the same mistake in a picture too and it really sucked because I didn't think to take a couple of shots, with the sign in, of the big assed bass that I caught.  There are many newbies on this  and in the tournament that may not be fully aware of the sign details requirement.  In case any of THEM are reading this post,, here is is what tripped ME up two years ago:  "" Qualifying fish:  Fish must be caught legally by angling methods only. No fish that appears to be caught illegally will be considered. Fish must be in season. Fish entered must comply with 'caught fish' regulations for the jurisdiction in which they are caught. Fish must be caught in waters of the the Province of Ontario (all of a body of water that lies at least partially within the boundaries of Ontario is considered Ontario waters; ie. all of Lake Erie is eligible). In the case of out of province members, fish must be caught in their home state or province or the waters previously outlined. Exceptions... no bass from California or Florida may be entered. You must provide a clear image of the fish. It is recommended, but not necessary, to have a measuring device in the image. You MUST include in the image the words 'OFC Community.com 2011' or 'OntarioFishing.net 2011'. You can write this down on anything you like, but it MUST be there. Do not enter fish without this requirement. The words OFC Community.com 2011 or OntarioFishing.net 2011 must be part of the original image and not edited in.""  Happy fishing."
589908,lunkerbasshunter,2011-06-05 12:24:00,2585,heard awesome things about tomiko  that is a nice fish  cheers!
589909,Joey,2011-06-05 12:26:00,9122," Well if that's the case alot of the entries already submitted wouldn't count as some of them only say OFC 2011, not OFC Community.com etc.  This is supposed to be a friendly tournament right?"
589912,limeyangler,2011-06-05 12:43:00,5204,Great fish Randy.  I have this thing about fishing walleye on flat calm days...never seem to do well.  You must be using the same barbless hooks I do.....missing 5
