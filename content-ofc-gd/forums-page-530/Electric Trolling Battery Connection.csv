590404,young_one,2011-06-06 23:17:00,620,"Quick question, forgot to take notes on how things were connected last fall... How should I connect these cables? Just want to make sure before I blow a fuse or something.  I have 12/24V, 8 Amps, 2 Banks on-board charger. 2 batteries and one trolling motor.    cables coming from charger (2 sets of positive and negative cables, and one bridge)   These are the cables coming from the electric trolling motor "
590406,Terry,2011-06-06 23:24:00,14456,are you sure it's 2 amps and 4 banks
590407,Terry,2011-06-06 23:29:00,14456,but with little info I am thinking it's a 24 volt motor so the batteries go in serial  and if so the red/red goes on the one pos terminal... it's yellow goes on the neg along with the black/neg wire from trolling motor  the single red goes on the other pos along with the red/pos wire to the trolling motor and it's yellow with the red goes on the neg  if it's 12 v then it's a whole different ball game
590408,young_one,2011-06-06 23:39:00,620," Yeah, you are right Terry! I believe its 12/24V, 8 Amps, 2 Banks"
590497,BFSC Kevin,2011-06-07 02:33:00,1351,want me to do it?
590506,irishfield,2011-06-07 02:47:00,26272,Leave them in next year!
590530,Roy,2011-06-07 06:26:00,13728,Here you go. Don't forget your breaker(s).  
590562,Fisherman,2011-06-07 11:21:00,7201,"Roy, it's past your bedtime   but you got it right.  The other fat red is for running the 2 batteries in series to make 24V"
