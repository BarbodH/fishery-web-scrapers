590140,ctdd2006,2011-06-06 04:07:00,531,...I've got a late 80's SeaNymph 17 footer side console...no top!  I love the boat and it treats us good other than the beating the sun gives us.  Any Suggestions?

590155,blue pickeral,2011-06-06 09:36:00,267,"Most boat upholstery/top/cover shops can make one up for you. Had one done for my boat for around $600. If you check a few marine supply catalogues, there are some ready made ones available from which you pick the size that fits your boat. A full cockpit cover that you can stand up under will be more expensive.  They are great protection from the sun and the rain."

They sold their business a few years ago but my sister in law (Kristina King) is still there looking after the administration. Whether you buy from them or not, it'd be worth your while to have a look through their website for tips on bimini tops.  This is one link: http://www.gmitopdesign.com/  This is another for FAQ: http://www.gmitopdesign.com/faq-e.html"
590167,mercman,2011-06-06 11:06:00,7054,"I had a bimini installed on my boat before i bought it.Plenty of head room.The casting deck, is clear, and the rear casting fishing chair is clear. Doesnt affect the ride when cruising either. You just have to be aware of the poles when casting or you can snap the tip off off your rod real easy"

590172,mercman,2011-06-06 11:42:00,7054," no comment Lew Lets just say, it wasnt my new rod"
