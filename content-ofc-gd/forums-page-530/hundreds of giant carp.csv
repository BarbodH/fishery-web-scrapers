I haven't ever really went carp fishing other than a long time ago, but I was thinking it might be fun to hook into one of these big beasts to see what they feel like. Anyone have any tips on fishing for them in a river from a boat? What do you need? hook size bait etc... I figure a circle hook some a a couple split shots and some of that carp bait stuff they sell in a bag at ctc?"

590686,Victor,2011-06-07 20:40:00,1609,Sweet corn on a hook would work. What Musky Mike said in terms of rig. Throw a few handful of corn into the area your fish as chum and cast your rig right in there. It's best if you can keep your hookbait stationary but it may be difficult if you are fishing from a boat.  With that said though I know a number of people who stalk them and have success just dragging the offering in front of the fish.  Good luck and let us know how you make out!
