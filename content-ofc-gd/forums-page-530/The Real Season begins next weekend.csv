590619,addy79,2011-06-07 14:35:00,573,"we fished Pigeon for about 8 hours yesterday and only had ONE follow! (shallow bay south of Gannon narrows)must've been doing something wrong...water was warmer than anticipated at up to 73 degrees.  we threw everything from big glider baits, handlebarz, marabous, grim reapers, believers, and on, and on, and on...  needless to say, im a little sore today  nonetheless, great day to be on the water"
590624,Rizzo,2011-06-07 15:13:00,4754,"yipes. I'll be at Pigeon Friday, hopefully things turn on by then. With those water temps might find the fish out at summer spots now closer to deep water"
590673,Sinker,2011-06-07 19:45:00,8692,"I pulled a 38""er off a deep weedline this morning on scugog. Water was 73 by the time I left. 70 when I launched. It was nice to get the smell in the boat again!!  S."
588854,Whitemikeca,2011-06-01 17:01:00,138, Unfortunately we won't be able to go up on saturday as its the old lady's birthday  We will be up Monday instead.  Hopefully you guys save some muskys for us to catch then.
588855,Whitemikeca,2011-06-01 17:03:00,138," Mike, I can't wait to put those lures of yours to the test.  My boat better smell like musky slime by the end of the day!!!"
588893,addy79,2011-06-01 18:35:00,573," HA! Oops! was hoping you missed that thread!  I luv that boat, buy a bigger one and sell the ""junker"" to me"
589193,ehg,2011-06-02 15:19:00,2666,"Yup, will be around Big Island on Pigeon Lake like last couple decades for this musky opener. Two more sleeps to go..."
589200,lew,2011-06-02 15:37:00,12766,"I'll be up around the island later in the day Eric, what boat are you gonna be in ??"
589204,ehg,2011-06-02 16:01:00,2666,"Hi Lew, will be one of the tinners with red sides up there. If i see you will wave or say hi. If i catch anything decent will put a little report on board here as well. Good fishing"
589212,lew,2011-06-02 16:43:00,12766," Thanks Eric, I'll watch for you.  Their calling for some showers up this way for the week-end so you may want to pack a rain jacket just in case."
589227,Squid,2011-06-02 18:03:00,1656,"Sounds like an ONFC G2G to me boyz!!! I haven't decided whether to go to LSC, Kawarthas or Lake erie   My plan to go north of north bay for the weekend with the boys did not pan out. Both have summer jobs and both have to work on Saturday and Sunday"
589248,landry,2011-06-02 20:30:00,1005,My weekend muskie opener trip just got cancelled last minute!!!!!! Feels like Christmas got cancelled:( Some things are more important than muskie fishing though - believe it or not. Landry   
589262,Squid,2011-06-02 21:41:00,1656,Kawarthas it is!! I'll be there with my bro in his legend!!!
589273,Pigeontroller,2011-06-02 22:34:00,2793,"I'll be on Pigeon, likely south end. Not in my boat but Bruno's grey Lund with a shinny new Yamaha F70!"
589339,Rizzo,2011-06-03 01:56:00,4754,"sounds like Pigeon will be shoulder to shoulder. Don't sting them all, I can't get there until Wednesday"
589449,Squid,2011-06-03 14:21:00,1656,wow lots of folks going to pigeon!! lets pick a vhf radio channel to chat on.
589461,mistaredone,2011-06-03 14:48:00,913,"It's a junker Mike but it puts you on the fish and kept us out of the freezing cold water last fall lol!  If you get another weekday off its my boat, my lake.  Did you get the Trinidad? "
589518,Whitemikeca,2011-06-03 18:15:00,138," Yeah I guess it is a junker Steve.  Oh well, I just need to get one more year out of her and then I will upgrade to something nice.  I did get the Trinidad.  Can't wait to give it a try on Monday.  June is pretty hard for me as its one of the busiest times of the year for me at work.  I will let you know if I get a free day for sure.  Looking forward to chasing those muskys on your Lake X.  In July I will literally have nothing to do at work so I plan on ""working from home"" (fishing   ) a lot!  We can definetly meet up then."
589657,Handlebarz,2011-06-04 02:33:00,3790,Well time for bed 4am will come quick Good luck to everyone chasing toothy critters tomorrow. I feel like I should be out there at the launch right now.
589681,Rizzo,2011-06-04 06:51:00,4754,"nuts, I should just be getting up to go fishing...instead I'm up because baby #4 is up screaming like a banshee. I've got some pretty stubborn kids when it comes to sleeping! Good luck everyone."
589713,ehg,2011-06-04 13:59:00,2666,Good thing the reality of having back surgery a week or so ago kept me off water today. Looks like it is going to storm all morning/afternoon. Any musky opener reports from today are going to be rain soaked.
589715,Spiel,2011-06-04 14:06:00,9065," I was thinking much the same thing Erik, while it hasn't rained yet here in Hamilton the skies are balck, thunder is rumbling and the winds are eerily calm, me thinks a storm is immanent. But then again I understand that's good for musky fishing.  I hope all our friends play safe and don't risk their necks for a fish."
589727,Spiel,2011-06-04 14:52:00,9065,"Well since my last post 40 minutes ago the weather has become severe, pissing rain, thunder, lightning with extreme winds out of a northerly direction and the temperature dropped quicky.  I hope all of our members (and non members) can see what's approaching with enough to time to get off the water safely. Very nasty out there!"
589729,Sinker,2011-06-04 15:01:00,8692,"Yep, its dirty up here in the Kawartha's too. Thunder, lightening and pouring rain. The wind isn't too bad though.....yet anyways.   S."
589730,Sinker,2011-06-04 15:02:00,8692,"Yep, its dirty up here in the Kawartha's too. Thunder, lightening and pouring rain. The wind isn't too bad though.....yet anyways.   S."
589732,Handlebarz,2011-06-04 15:09:00,3790,Thats funny about the rain I was cruising LSC this morning looking for cleaner water but chased down some huge rain drops so I turned the boat around and fished behind the storm it was kinda nice being on the right side of the rain.
589746,Jigger,2011-06-04 15:56:00,1237,Glad i took my time getting to the cottage today! Gonna load the boat shortly and go chase down some teeth! Stopped raining now and should be good to go within the half-hour! Let the games begin!
589762,Sinker,2011-06-04 16:53:00,8692,Sunshine here now. Good to go!!  S.
588446,lew,2011-05-31 15:04:00,12766,I'm heading to the shallow weed flats on Pigeon south of Gannons Narrows.
588448,Harrison,2011-05-31 15:09:00,2202," So am I, we might as well boat pool and save gas.  Where we meeting?"
588450,lew,2011-05-31 15:12:00,12766,I'm probably gonna launch at Gannons Narrows Marina Phil but not sure of the time yet.
588453,bigbuck,2011-05-31 15:28:00,2449,"Nice!!! I'm waiting for the 3rd sat in June as well. My had caught 2 a 48 and a 52incher in GBay over the past week walleye fishing. Figures, hopefully I get a couple 'eyes over the weekend to grace the pan while I patiently wait for the GBay opener."
588460,addy79,2011-05-31 16:02:00,573, DITTO!
588468,lew,2011-05-31 16:41:00,12766," This'll be me Addy, hopefully with a big stringer of muskies dragging behind  C'mon over & say hey if you spot us.  What boat will you be in ??   "
588474,addy79,2011-05-31 17:09:00,573," Sounds good, will do!  We'll be in a 15' White ""Canadian Classic"" junker boat with an old 45HP Merc. LOL  The boat is moored at Emerald Isle Marina.  Handlebarz are READY 2 FLY"
588477,TroutnMuskieHunter,2011-05-31 17:23:00,1362,I'm just itchin' to get out on the river lads!!!...season doesn't open here until June 17th but that give me some time to go on the annual fly-in trip coming up real soon!!!
588481,lew,2011-05-31 17:32:00,12766," I've probably seen your boat many times, I always use their ramp when I'm fishing Upper Buck."
588483,addy79,2011-05-31 17:42:00,573," its actually fellow OFC'er Whitemikeca's boat, I'll be the eager passenger sitting to his left.  good luck"
588485,Spiel,2011-05-31 17:50:00,9065,Well I don't get all excited about musky fishing per say but I'm almost finished a new musky rod that'll be heading to Lakair with me. Hopefully it'll catch me something.    
588514,mistyriver1,2011-05-31 19:49:00,600," Are you heading out with Sherri Lew?    That looks real nice Chris , nice job"
588529,lew,2011-05-31 20:20:00,12766," Absolutely Jim, she's had the musky bug real bad for a few years now and she joins me as often as possible.  Where bout's you guys heading on Saturday ??"
588530,mike rousseau,2011-05-31 20:22:00,4661,Itle be the rideau river for me and my buddies...  It's nice fishing a little river like that when your used to the st lawrence
588535,Jer,2011-05-31 20:38:00,1426, We might see you out there as well. That's our traditional musky opener water...
588536,mistyriver1,2011-05-31 20:39:00,600,"  Probably Kawarthas somewhere Lew, I'll probably end up just going to look for a shiny skeeter boat and follow it around"
588538,Spiel,2011-05-31 20:45:00,9065," Thanks Jim, much appreciated. I'm gonna make sure you fondle it, new business is always welcome."
588552,lew,2011-05-31 21:26:00,12766," I may be interested in up-grading to one of your works of art myself someday  Chris, just not sure about the fondling part though"
588553,Terry,2011-05-31 21:29:00,14456, that's just wrong
588555,Spiel,2011-05-31 21:36:00,9065,"    Sure, it sounds way wrong, I agree, but it's getting attention."
588627,muskymike,2011-06-01 00:39:00,772, Ditto for us. Just south of Manotick here.
588632,Handlebarz,2011-06-01 00:53:00,3790,  Jim if your going to follow that boat around on Pigeon don't follow it race around it full tilt pull up on the next point and cast your bobber it works like a charm  I know there are a few OFC members heading down to LSC I will be out with my little girl and having a blast with her. For the guys heading down here that I have not talked to  PLEASE WATCH OUT FOR FLOATING EVERYTHING OUT HERE!!! This spring has been cleaning out all the creeks fields and back yards you will find everything from twigs to full trees and they will be just under the water the water right now is very dirty and its hard to see these things so please be careful out here on LSC this weekend. Play safe and shoot me a PM if your heading down here or have a look for us we will be in this boat.   
588659,mike rousseau,2011-06-01 01:50:00,4661, Same
588687,Crazyhook,2011-06-01 02:54:00,1154,Can't wait to toss some big baits! Good luck everyone
588846,Whitemikeca,2011-06-01 16:55:00,138, Hey I take offence to you calling my boat a junker boat!!  That junker boat has treated me well the last 5 years.  You are no longer welcome aboard!!!!!
587627,mistyriver1,2011-05-29 01:30:00,600,At least in some places....Anybody else ready?  Got out last weekend for these guys as a warmup and hoping to get out tomorrow.     But I'm ready for these guys....Anybody else?        Wanna try out a few of these girls (as in double cow girls) that I made over the course of the winter....    Good luck to everyone this season...  Jim
587629,Terry,2011-05-29 01:34:00,14456,"I did not catch any MUSKIE last year but fished for them many times  so yeah, I am ready to correct that problem and get some real slime in my boat"
587631,landry,2011-05-29 01:43:00,1005,i like the crappie colour double ten bucktail - looks perty:) I can't wait till next weekend!!!!!! Better than Christmas.
587632,ehg,2011-05-29 01:44:00,2666,Gonna try the musky opener next weekend. Casting bucktails and trolling spinnerbaits hopefully will work.
587633,fishnsled,2011-05-29 01:44:00,3520,  I guess the real question would be which boat Terry? I'd stick with the #2 boat after your report from today.  Looking forward to chasing some muskies myself but it will be a couple of weeks before I can do so.
587634,asdve23rveavwa,2011-05-29 01:46:00,2690,I've been counting down the days for a couple weeks now...bring it on
587635,Joey,2011-05-29 01:46:00,9122,"Yep, ready and waiting Jim.  Good luck out there this year"
587639,Pigeontroller,2011-05-29 01:56:00,2793,SlimeTime!  
587652,mike rousseau,2011-05-29 02:37:00,4661,Got one by accident the other day...  Got me itchen real bad for opener...
587660,msp,2011-05-29 03:05:00,1336,Good luck next weekend ! That black & white double cowgirl looks mint
587688,Ron,2011-05-29 08:41:00,1683,This will be the first opener I will miss in many years for Muskie. I don't mind though as I will be getting my gear ready for my annual trip North!
587700,outllaw,2011-05-29 10:47:00,1232,"i will be on st clair running my minee mee,s up hi on the boards. been a long wait. try some handlebarz,up hi also. . the fish spawn is near finished but the waters gotta clear up."
587702,singingdog,2011-05-29 10:54:00,1047,Definitely ready. Yakfishing for musky: doesn't get much better than that.
587750,Garry2Rs,2011-05-29 14:18:00,1425,"Surprise, surprise there's nice weather predicted for next weekend too."
587756,Pigeontroller,2011-05-29 14:30:00,2793, Nice weather? I want Muskie Weather!!!
587757,Handlebarz,2011-05-29 14:34:00,3790,Yep it should all come together for us this week I was looking at the long range forecast for my area and the temps stating today will be in the 80's with NO RAIN after today (Will have to see about that) and then cooling a bit to make it bare able on the water next weekend.  Slowpoke was going to join me for opener but had to change plans something about working and putting food on the table at home talk about wrong priorities  My biggest hurdle is will the boat be back from the boat doctor? He called yesterday and found broken parts in the lower end but it ran fine last time out still hitting her normal top speeds WTH.  Oh yeah back to the topic at hand HECK YEAH I am ready for sure.  Jim you have some nice looking baits there I to like the blades on the striped one.  Cheers and good luck to everyone
587777,WeedLine,2011-05-29 15:23:00,322,"The baby loon and the orange bladed one look amazing, good job. Hope you get a few"
587778,houski,2011-05-29 15:27:00,61,"I've been waiting for June 4th, 2011, since December 16, 2010! Can't wait to smell like pennies again!  I'll be out somewhere in the Kawartha's next weekend for sure. Not too sure where yet though, I'm gonna have to talk it over with my fishing partner.  Good luck Ladies and Gents!"
587874,BillM,2011-05-29 23:02:00,17367,I'll be out in Gbay somewhere
587895,Pigeontroller,2011-05-29 23:54:00,2793, Hopefully not targeting Muskies as the season will be closed still on GB...
587897,redskullz,2011-05-29 23:57:00,55,"That loon lure looks amazing! Way to go! I have a little back lake where is a very goood chance at a muskie over the course of a weekend, but i cant get in there anymore with the 1.5km portage and my injured neck. Ah well.....i hope to get out to georgian bay and try for some."
587903,BillM,2011-05-30 00:20:00,17367," Nope, pike.  Just waiting for some nice weather to make the run I'm thinking about.  3rd sat in June for muskies on Gbay if I'm not mistaken."
587928,Rizzo,2011-05-30 01:06:00,4754,"can't get out for opener, but I have 3 days planned at Pigeon for the next week which is already keeping me awake at night. Been a lllloooooonnnnnnnggggggg winter. Even fired some of my new handlebarz bucktails out on Saturday while I was pike fishing. Man those things cast a mile!"
588360,Pigeontroller,2011-05-31 03:18:00,2793, You are correct Sir!
588435,ehg,2011-05-31 13:57:00,2666,"Really looking forward to musky opener on Kawarthas. Bucktails and musky spinnerbaits should work, this year i am going to try a musky size swimbait for first time. These 'swimbaits' are supposedly good but obviously learning curve is involved. Gonna need patience..."
