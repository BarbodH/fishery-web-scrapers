Great weather, too many little misshaps but we managed OK. Hooked onto a decent sheephead and passed the pole over to the Mrs while I swung the boat around and let her have the fun of reeling it in. They put up a nice little battle and since no others were caught I was glad to have let her pull it into the boat.  That's it, just one landed, a couple of missed ones and a little sunburn. Alot of boats out on the lower Grand today. Iv'e seen it worse but there is nothing like enjoying the almost solitude of a weekday on the water rather than the weekend crowd.  "
