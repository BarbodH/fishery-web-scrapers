You'll love his reply to the lady who interviewed him concerning guns and children. Regardless of how you feel about gun laws you gotta love this! This is one of the best comeback lines of all time. It is a portion of an ABC interview between a female broadcaster and General Cosgrove who was about to sponsor a Boy Scout Troop visiting his military headquarters.  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: So, General Cosgrove, what things are you going to teach these young boys when they visit your base?  GENERAL COSGROVE: We're going to teach them climbing, canoeing, archery and shooting.  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Shooting! That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?  GENERAL COSGROVE: I don't see why, they'll be properly supervised on the rifle range.  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Don't you admit that this is a terribly dangerous activity to be teaching children?  GENERAL COSGROVE: I don't see how. We will be teaching them proper rifle discipline before they even touch a firearm.  FEMALE INTERVIEWER: But you're equipping them to become violent killers.  GENERAL COSGROVE: Well, Ma'am, you're equipped to be a prostitute, but you're not one, are you?  The radio went silent and the interview ended."

One morning the husband returns after several hours of fishing and decides to take a short nap. Although she isn't familiar with the lake, the wife decides to take the boat. She motors out a short distance, anchors, and continues to read her book. Along comes the game warden in his boat. He pulls up alongside her and says,""Good morning, Ma'am, what are you doing?"" ""Reading my book,"" she replies, thinking isn't that obvious? ""You're in a restricted fishing area,"" he informs her. ""But officer, I'm not fishing. Can't you see that?"" ""Yes, but you have all the equipment. I'll have to take you in and write you up."" ""If you do that, I'll have to charge you with rape,"" says the woman. ""But I haven't even touched you,"" says the game warden. ""That's true, but you do have all the equipment."" MORAL: Never argue with a woman who reads."
