590098,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-06 02:28:00,4399,Just wondering if anybody has used the Navionics app for android phones?
590357,Raycaster,2011-06-06 20:24:00,528, I followed the thread on here about people really impressed with the app.  Purchased the app for my LG Optimus One Android phone $13.99. I was happy that it worked within itself without the need for a constant data hookup. Looked great and was excited about it but it didn't really work well.  Not sure if it was the phone or app or map information but accuracy was brutal.  Just got back from fishing the Ahmic Lake this weekend and the app basically reported I was fishing on land 90% of the time. No wonder it wasn't a great weekend!  The GPS's accuracy was good to about 500 yards! not 30 feet.  I realize maps get old and land reshapes but something was really off.  I'm going to send email to Navionics but for $13.99 I'm not too upset...
