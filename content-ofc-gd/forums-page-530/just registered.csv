590367,ChrisK,2011-06-06 20:53:00,2772,"Hey Dev,welcome aboard  Just to fill you all in to who this new kid on the block is he's a young fella who over the years has been growing up with us on the river. First time I met Devin he was about 8 or 9 years old watching us fish for steel from the riverbank in his rubbers. Over the years he's showed a lot of interest always asking questions,picking up a lot of good tips and finally making his way out of his rubber boots into a pair of waders.Also inherited some nice float fishing equipment from his big river brothers    and now stands with us catching steel like a seasoned pro at 14. Just recently Devin has decided to take up fly tying. Its been two weeks now and he's a real natural being able to tie some sweet steel head patterns... Anyhow welcome again to OFC Dev.....  "
