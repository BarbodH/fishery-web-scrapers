588640,Keenan,2011-06-01 01:14:00,59,Was at my mom's friends house today and he had a bunch of old lures that he got when his father passed away. I thought this one was really cool but he didn't know who made it or what it was called. He has taken it to tackle shops every where and nobody could tell him anything about it. Maybe someone on here knows? thought it would be worth a shot. Here are a few pics i took.

588646,Leecher,2011-06-01 01:20:00,7832,It looks similar to a flatfish....  but don't have a clue what it is    Neat looking bait though
588652,ChrisK,2011-06-01 01:28:00,2772,Kinda reminds me of a squid
588663,vance,2011-06-01 01:58:00,719,My dad's old tackle box has one of those in it I just wish I could ask him what it is.  vance

588676,GBW,2011-06-01 02:36:00,8460,I would be sending and email to http://driftertackle.com/ to see if it's one they made.
588803,Nipfisher,2011-06-01 15:19:00,2449,"Looks like it is part of the flat fish series or the ""canadian wiggler"" series. I have seen similar lures but always in the silver or green finish."
588814,Lip-ripper,2011-06-01 15:54:00,228,"looks like it could be an Antique ""Hot Shot"" or one of the Lures made by a company called ""Rush Tango"""
589944,Keenan,2011-06-05 16:36:00,59,Thanks guy. Could it be made by Heddon?
