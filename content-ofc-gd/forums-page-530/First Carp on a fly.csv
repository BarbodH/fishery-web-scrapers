589652,hawk-eye,2011-06-04 02:21:00,141,Well I finnaly got to put my beginer fly fishin skills to the test this morning. After working the graveyard shift and arriving home just as the sun was comming up I thought theres no way Im gonna go to bed with that dead wind and a nice little fog rolling over the surface of the river. I am by no means a fly angler but I like to play arround with it once and a while mainly targeting panfish. Knowing there are a lot of carp that like to feed on the surface down the river here I thought this would be a great oppertunity to give it a whirl. As I casted my first fly in front of a passing school I scared the hell outta them quickly learning that carp are easily spooked. Now Ive got to learn to ba a little more stelthy. After a half an hour or so of casting away from the fish to tune my casting a bit I headed back to the fish. Within a couple minutes of trying to steddy the heart rate as they were swimmin arround my fly one finnaly took it. What a blast! Ill be back at this again for sure.
