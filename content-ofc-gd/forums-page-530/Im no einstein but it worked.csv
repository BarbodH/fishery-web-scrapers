Yes I could have purchased 2 drift socks but seeing them in use, it would take up valiable space needed behind my boat. This am I had a brain fart at metro(5am), I asked for 2 eco shopping bags and nothing else besides some water. She looked at me a little odd and i told the quity pie its for the boat Anyhoo. I gave it a go,one on each side and it put me to the speed I wanted Call me cheap but they worked 2 bucks compared to 100 plus. Everyone told me it wouldnt work, haha!!!!!"
589830,misfish,2011-06-05 00:23:00,29133,IKEA bags works aswell.
589831,vinnimon,2011-06-05 00:30:00,2593,  Best thing brian is that its tucked closely to the corners without interfering with any lines
589850,Raf,2011-06-05 01:28:00,3495,one or two 5 gallon pails work good too
589851,Handlebarz,2011-06-05 01:31:00,3790,Only problem with 5 gallon pains is they sink when you take off and the boat is sluggish until you BLAST OFF and then remember that they were still tied off   :wallbash:     YES three walll bangs because I know dad and I did this at least 3 times in the past.
589870,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-05 02:29:00,1107,at least it wasn't a giant danforth anchor I saw a guy on plane in a 24' cruiser with a anchor skippin across the water behind him it almost hit the stern of the boat a few times before I flagged him down .I've used the white bucket drift socks to .
589917,Rod Caster,2011-06-05 13:14:00,5784,"That's a great idea. I'd like to use something like that in my canoe to slow dowqn the drifts, but it would be too dangerous. My einstein moment: forgot the anchor so tied up to a rock and it worked wonders"
589940,bassman,2011-06-05 16:18:00,384,"Any pics of your design? Just wondering where you cut the hole, and how long of a rope you use etc.  Nice idea!"
589960,vinnimon,2011-06-05 18:41:00,2593,"  design , just the way I purchased them. Tied off each handle on a short leash, just to tuck in tight at the corners of the stern. one thing I would to them is tie a tether to the base to reverse the bag while trying to pull it in. But its only 3 to 6 ft away from the boat For a buck who cares"
589980,Leecher,2011-06-05 20:24:00,7832,Right on Vinni    Good thinking Can't go wrong for the price Jacques
