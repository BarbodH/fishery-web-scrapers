Next week I have to renew 3 prescriptions . . . . .   for about $240.00 instead of $48.00 . . . .   many, many more don't want a strike any more than I do!! I'm also waiting for a knee replacement . .  .  .   the result of dragging a heavy satchel of mail up & down (broken) stairs for nearly 25 years! I just want to do the job I was hired to do . . . .   peacefully . . . . .   ."
589930,tb4me,2011-06-05 14:55:00,3295,Are you not still working? For some reason I thought there were striking at various locations only? no? Postal Strike? Legislate these unreallistic unions back to work or out on the street. A whole country should not be held hostage by  a union who obviously have no concept of what the average cat puts up with in most jobs for less money.
589936,ah_long,2011-06-05 15:52:00,354,"I wouldn't go all out and say that Union is a bad thing.. there are pros and cons with having a Union, it's just that nothing catches our attention more than a strike and more than often, people think that Unions love to go on strike. No one seems to say a bad thing about corporations and when they do lock outs in labour relation issues."
589943,Garry2Rs,2011-06-05 16:27:00,1425,"In the USA I get mail 6 days a week.  Delivery coast to coast takes two or three days.  The post boxes in my area are in groups of three so they're no more than one house away.  Postal rates are low.  When I leave, to come home to Canada, my mail is forward for free.  In Canada, I get mail 5 days a week.  Delivery is in the nature of ""Make a wish.""  My post box was moved a quarter mile down the road.  Why?  Because after all these years it wasn't safe for the mail person to stop in front of my house.  Moving my box across the road into the old third lane put in for the school bus wasn't viable...???  I guess that would have added an extra stop to the route.  Postal rates are 33% to 50% higher.  When I leave for the winter I have to pay $50.00 to send my mail to my daughter...To forward it to the States is so expensive, I wouldn't be able to afford to go south!  There is nothing in my mailbox these days that I couldn't get electronically, other than junk-mail or parcels. But anything bigger than a pack of cigarettes I have to pick up at the Post Office anyway.  I think that one of the courier services will be quick to pick up the slack in the parcel delivery business and I will have a net-gain in service.  Go C.U.P.E. Go...I won't miss you."

590118,redskullz,2011-06-06 03:15:00,55,"So the question(s) for me is should i sell a bunch of stuff on ebay or not? Should i buy some unpainted crankbait blanks, or is it destined that the blanks will be lost in limbo while CP is on strike?"
590182,bucktail,2011-06-06 12:31:00,1857,"Would not want to be in that position right now, with the demand for the postal service dropping, not much barganing leverage. At least I am ini the business that never goes down, delivering water to your house."
590187,Twocoda,2011-06-06 12:49:00,4130, Shouldnt an employer make money off the service they run?...maybe im taking your statement out of context but to me it sounds like because Canada Post makes money its the employees union(god) given rights to get more out of them...honestly...when the crap hits the fan for a bail out...and denied it ...then they will see how to make ends meet on a different kind of paper route
590188,Roy,2011-06-06 12:49:00,13728,A 24 hour break in postal delivery here in my area today. That will likely cripple the system.

Then the waiting game begins . . . .   who do you figure will run outta money and yell 'uncle' first . . . . .   then it'll be too late. There are plenty of us who'd be happy to take the money offered now & run, but there's a stumbling block called C. U. P. W., who are determined to get what THEY want for us, even if it kills US!!"

Would the federal government bail them out? No offence Terry, but at some point things will have to change, yes even in the government. Its a shame but instead if taking away sick days they should let all senior members have them but the line should be drawn here and now..Its simple, use them or loose them at the end of the year. I know guys that have over a years worth of sick days banked for retirement..That IMO is just wrong.. I'm not to sure how this will work out but I do know that Canada Post will drive a huge thick spike in the lid of the metaphorical coffin with another walkout.."
588573,lowerunit,2011-05-31 22:16:00,53,"The Post Office has made money for the last dozen years or more. And the sick time does not get payed out when you retire if you have 300 days banked they give you a nice hand shake and show you the door, absolutely nothing for them. They were always considered like insurance, to bank them in case someone broke a leg or got seriously sick."
588585,pics,2011-05-31 23:02:00,1268,"We never got sick days...if you are sick, you can take the day off without pay but you have to have a note from the doctor...that can be hard to do when you work in a 24hr 365day industry...try to get to your doctor an a sunday....If the posties strike i won't miss the bills but don't mess with my Ontario Out of Doors....."

This could be the worse thing they could do, Canada Post is becoming more and more irrelevant as time passes.  I would be impacted in no way if all mail delivery stopped.  Bills could be sent electronically, packages delivered via courier, magazine subs electronically, etc.  Imagine going to your employer and threatening to strike for (insert rediculous wage increase/benefit unheard of in the last decade to the rest of the real working world), they would laugh and show you the door!"
588790,fishermccann,2011-06-01 14:54:00,655,"I have worked for the CNR, the CIBC ,and now the City of Toronto, I have seen both sides of this issue. Everyone who does the same job in a union gets the same pay, but at the bank ,those who kissed the most a--  , got ""merit"" increases each year. So you may be doing the same job, the same way, but could earn many dollars less.  The bank was by far the most unfair employer. Also I have a friend who was in managment at Canada Post for 28 years , he was let go last year before he could reap the rewards of a great pention plan, CP did it just to save money.(his)."

589249,bubbles,2011-06-02 20:31:00,591,"I could care less if they strike.  Unions are learning the hard way that their days are numbered, they are useless.  They have taken things way too far and companies are starting to take a stand.  It's about time."

589263,Big Cliff,2011-06-02 21:43:00,6899,"As far as I am conserned Canada post (well, their union anyway) has written their own obituary.  For years we were held hostage. We had to pay what ever they dictated and be satisified with the service they offered. Their lack of service and costs involved necissated something better.  Then came Telex. That was a quick method of getting information from one place to another but it had it's limitations.  Next it was fax, again a big improvement, now you could send digital images, only in black and white but better than waiting a couple of days for the post office to deliver them (if they ever got there) and it was less expensive.  Now using email or text messaging we can send almost any information we want back and forth in seconds at very little or no cost. All these other systems were derived out of necessity!  No wonder Canada Post is going down the tubes. Think about it; you give customers less than state of the art service, charge them more than they need to pay, and tell them they can like it or lump it? Instead they should have been on the leading edge of delivering these services. Oh but wait the union wouldn't go for that, it might take mailmen (persons) off the streets and force them to work in offices developing software or doing customer support. Can't have that!!!!  Sorry but that is the way of the world, if I don't like what you are offering, I will find an alternative.  About the only thing that gets delivered to my mail box anymore is junk mail (oh wait, Canada Post delivers that) so should they be called mailmen or junkmen?  BTW, no disrespect is ment to any Canada Post employees, you have a job, and you do it, Kudos to you! i know several and they are all good people.  I do have one more question though; who voted in the union in the first place and why?  Could it have been for more money, benefits, a nice retirement package? Could it have been greed?  It is a long time in coming but I think that your union has just priced you out of a job or will in the near future!"

My sister works for the post office and is making huge $$$ in my books and hers also it's $24+/hr and she is a office manager yep passes out stamps and takes packages and stands around a lot I would say that's some great $$$ for the job. She voted to NOT STRIKE as she needs the $$$ but will be forced out if others vote to strike."

Who the hell wants to lose what was fought for in past contract negotiations?  However, dropping the starting pay to $18 and hour from the current $23 an hour does makes the me shake my head and  because there are a whole lot of underpaid workers and unemployed who would stand in line for hours or days to have the opportunity to get one of those jobs.
