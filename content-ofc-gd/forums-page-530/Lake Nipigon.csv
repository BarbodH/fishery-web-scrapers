589632,Ron,2011-06-04 00:27:00,1683,"Now how did I miss this report????  Looks like you boys had a stellar trip.  Were you guys able to get into Rea Lake or Teapot Lake?  We are hoping to explore Kelvin Islands this year. I am making room for an additional 40 liters of fuel in the boat for the trek.  Ahhh, the excitement of exploration!  Cheers, Ron..."
589643,Guidofisherman,2011-06-04 01:36:00,206,Now that's Nipigon fishing at its best. Three personal bests is spectacular. Congrats.

589705,schooner dave,2011-06-04 12:54:00,8,Looks like you had a fantastic trip...I love the nipigon area. I've been fortunate to be able to have been going to this area for the past 10 years every May. When the ice comes off  Nipigon has always been an issue. Last year my son and I fished around Shakespaere island and did really well for brookies. I also have never seen another boat on the water in May.  I'm wondering if I've been reading the MNR regs incorrectly though? My understanding is that Lake Trout season opens on the 4th Sat in May? It used to be the 1st Sat in May until the new MNR regs came into effect a few years ago. If there is an exception for Lake Nipigon? I'd love to know if there is as I've been missing out going for Lake Trout in early May.  For me the drive and fuel expense is well worth it...congrats again on a great trip.
590048,Toronto_Fisherman,2011-06-06 00:08:00,2,"Those pictures were incredible, they have me packing for my trip four days earlier.  Did you see much in the way of bears around Nipigon?"
590051,Handlebarz,2011-06-06 00:11:00,3790,Great report I sure do love these Nip reports
590055,danc,2011-06-06 00:18:00,4677," Saw one there yesterday that was about as high as the roof of my half ton. I got out of my truck and ran after her for a photo, but she was too fast for me. There was bear scat all over the road in the drive in too, so it looks like you'll be in luck. There's tons of them up there.  And like everything else in the Nipigon area, they grow up to be incredibly huge. My buddy had his boat seat eaten by one last week. Bring your camera."
