588760,craigdritchie,2011-06-01 13:25:00,1586,"The issue isn't whether or not the van can tow the boat. The question is, can you tow it without exposing yourself to unexpected risk?  By the time you factor in the weight of the boat, the trailer, the outboard, a couple of batteries, other boat gear and maybe half a tank of boat gas, you're going to be very close to hitting that 2,000 pound maximum towing weight - if not over it. Go fish on a rainy day and that carpeted deck will suck up a lot of water, adding even more weight.  If the weight of the trailer is approaching the maximum, then you need to look at your vehicle's GVWR, the Gross Vehicle Weight Rating. That's the maximum weight the vehicle can accommodate in total, including all passengers, gas in the van, all your cargo plus the weight of the towed boat. If you were to have any kind of accident and be found to be over your GVWR, your insurance is void.  Since Chrysler will rate the van to tow 3,800 pounds with a tow package, you should be okay. But make certain you get the tow package from Chrysler, as it may be required to attain a higher GVWR.  Just food for thought :-)"

589467,Banger68,2011-06-03 15:01:00,157,"I've towed my 18' Sylvan w/115 with my 2005 Town & Country w/3.8. The van pulls my boat fairly well, but I feel I'm at the vans safe limit and wouldn't go much heavier if any. My van does have the towing package that consists of a larger tranny cooler, oil cooler, larger rad (extra cooling), and the load leveling rear suspension. And my trailer does have brakes on it.  The van weights as much if not more then the small pickups and SUV's so I have never had an issue with it on the highway (tail wagging the dog problem). I've never had a problem on a ramp (knock on wood)but I haven't been on any extreme or bad repair ramps but I seem to do fine when 2wd trucks are spinning. You see the short comings of towing with a van on rough roads and such as it isn't as stiff (sturdy) as a vehicle with frame or 4WD.  With that said I've also pulled it with a full size Ram & a Grand Cherokee and it works out much better. They are just not working as hard.  Towing a 20' boat will be pushing it to the limit IMHO."
589490,alphaalpha,2011-06-03 17:01:00,475,"I picked up a 19xcaliber this year and I like it (upgraded the motor to a 115hp, max rated for 150).  A couple minor issues that I had to get fixed after as the early spring water was too high for them to put it in to water test it when I picked it up.  When I first ordered the boat I asked what the total weight of it + trailer and motor would be as I needed to buy a new vehicle to tow.  If I remember right the total empty weight of the package was ~2300lbs.  Put in a full tank of gas and all your gear (especially if going on a long camping trip or something) and that number goes up fast.  When looking I limited my search to SUV's that could tow at least 5000lbs so I wouldn't have a problem.  I picked up a 2005 nissan pathfinder and it is rated for 6000, is rear wheel drive with 4x4 also.  It has a 4.0L v6 and gets about 14.5L/100km.  I have no problems pulling it but you do notice that it is there especially going up large hills.  On a hot day going up a big hill on the hwy I wouldn't want to be pulling it with something that is at max towing capacity.  As far as breaking goes I don't have too much trouble but I make sure I leave lots of space.  I have had to break fairly hard a couple times though and haven't had a problem but it still makes me nervous and I do my best to avoid it.  -AA"
589491,doubleheader,2011-06-03 17:04:00,497,"As a kid I remember Dad pulling an 18' boat to Canada up the QEW with a Dodge Dart. Remeber those death traps? I would sit in the back seat praying to God we wouldn't crash as the boat pulled the back end of the car back and forth at highway speed. Point being, yes you can use your mini-van but you will have substantially reduced your margin of safety. I would urge you to consider a tow vehicle or a much smaller boat. Personally I wouldn't pull more than 1500 lbs with a front wheel drive mini-van."
589504,Wymen,2011-06-03 17:50:00,30,"This towing issue has also been concerning me and I'm still on the fence. I have mid-size passenger car, but it does have 4 wheel drive and I have concerns if it can tow a 15' or 16' boat /w gear and I'm trying to keep the weight <1200lbs to be safe.  Tow rating for my car according to european specs is 2500lbs..  North American specs does not mention a thing...  Dealer says a light load should be ok... (whatever that means)  Same concerns as what a lot of people have mentioned. - Tranny & brake wear due to excessive load. - traction and power when launching  IMO short drives vs long trips shouldn't matter.  The various parts of your car are still getting damaged.  It should be more along the lines of how frequent you plan on towing the boat.  If its once in a while, the damage will be minimal.  But if its frequent, even short trips will start to show damage.  Wymen"
589678,OutdoorDan,2011-06-04 05:51:00,325,"Everyone,  Thank you a lot for all the input. From this thread I gather that it's doable, but not exactly a great option or viable long term option to tow the boat with the van. For now I think that I will move on to deciding on the boat specifications, and deal with car issues situationally (meaning either upgrade to another car if/when needed or store the boat where I will be using it). I don't want to make a sacrifice for a smaller boat based on the vehicle as I essentially expect the boat to be a one in a lifetime purchase and want to get it right. I also want to be able to take the boat out on big water (Georgian Bay) comfortably, and fit my family and various equipment depending on time of year. Beyond that: who the hell ever wishes they had a smaller boat?!   With that said, I have a lot of questions with regard to the boat itself. Mods, is it okay to start a new thread with my boat questions, or should I continue that in this one?  Thanks,  Dan."
590575,33825,2011-06-07 12:31:00,7,"Dan,  I used to pull my 18' aluminum bowrider with my minivan and yes it can be done, but not safely or efficiently. If you are putting it in the water in the spring and taking it out in the fall then you could manage. However, if you fish (and trailer the boat a lot) by the time you start to see any issues it will be too late. I now have a 6cylinder 4.0L 4x4 and it does not have to work as hard and is awesome at the launch regardless of how shady the conditions are.  Keep your hooks sharp!"

588566,OutdoorDan,2011-05-31 22:04:00,325,"Hi all,  I've been lurking for a little and finally decided to join!    I'm currently in the process of purchasing a new boat. The front runner at the moment is the Legend 20 Excalibur, and while I have more questions about the boat and motor, that is for later. First I have to deal with figuring out how to tow it.    I currently have a 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan. As far as I understand, they have a 2000lb towing capacity (which would be right around the weight of the boat). I've also found that you can have a towing package installed on the car, which will get the towing capacity up to 3800lbs, which would seem plenty. However I understand that there is a difference between ""can tow"" and ""should tow,"" so I would really appreciate commentary on the matter. If I can't tow this boat, what is the biggest boat I can safely tow with my car? Are there any other implications I should be aware of? I understand I'm asking broad questions, I'm trying to get a good all-round understanding of all the issues at hand.    Getting another car instead of the caravan is not completely out of the question, however something I would very much like to avoid.    Thanks all for your help.    Dan."

588621,green&orange,2011-06-01 00:26:00,31,"Absolutely no disrespect to anyone here, but I think that towing that boat with a minivan is a mistake.  The tow rating of the vehicle typically includes gear and passengers in the vehicle.  The hull itself is 1500 lbs.  I'm not sure about the motor you are talking about but my 90 HP Merc 4 stroke is 400 lbs so you are at 1900 lbs minimum.  Add gas, boat gear, batteries, trailer itself, fishing gear and you are easily pushing 3500 lbs.  Add in gear and passengers and you will be right there.  Maybe if you are only going a few miles back and forth on the ramp.  But that would be it.  Pulling that rig up the ramp will be a challenge with the van IMO.  Sorry, just my take.  Good luck."

588707,OutdoorDan,2011-06-01 04:36:00,325,"Thanks everyone for the responses - keep them coming!  I also appreciate the discussion with regards to the Legend being a good choice. It's something I am strongly going to consider in the near future, but I need to sort out my vehicle situation first.  Spincast,  What exactly do I do to check if my car is equipped with a transmission cooler (in the sense that all cars have transmission coolers, so I assume I would be checking for an after market version). The car was bought used a few years ago. It had a hitch already so I am wondering if it may already have it installed by the previous owner.  Thanks!"
588713,spincast,2011-06-01 09:30:00,3279,"Check with a dealer. Give them the VIN and tell them what you plan on towing. You may need to install an upgraded cooler. Not sure about Chrysler products, but in my old mini van (GMC) it was recommended I install one by a few people I spoke to (mechanics and tranny shops), so I put one on to deal with the higher temps. My newer  Sante Fe and the Sierra both already had one, so it really depends on what it came with from the manufacturer - but a 20 fter and a full load will put a lot of heat on a mini van tranny. A couple hundred bucks on a cooler beats a few grand for a tranny + an afternoon on the side of the road."
588722,Billy Bob,2011-06-01 10:59:00,5865,"IF you are going to be towing locally (nearby lakes) I would say ""OK"" with the mini van...but if you are going to be doing ANY traveling you should get a full size truck to do your towing.  On a truck that has a factory tow package it includes more then just a tranny cooler...it comes with lower rear end gear ratio for towing, a tranny temp gauge, the correct wiring for 4 wire and or 7 wire connects and sometimes even heavy duty brakes and sway bars....adding just a tranny cooler to your mini van should be done for LOCAL towing but will not help you on long trips....stopping and even just handling will be a challenge and NOT a enjoyable trip each time out.  Sure you will see others with larger boats then they should have on their mini vans but that doesn't make it right...they are treading in dangerous waters IMHO.  Good Luck and Play it Safe, Bob"
588723,Fish Farmer,2011-06-01 11:00:00,2234,"Lets go the other way, why a bigger boat?? With the price of gas... you don't need a bigger boat to catch fish. Plus with a smaller boat you can keep your van. With a bigger boat your going to need a big tow vehicle (Truck SUV). The money you save on Gas and smaller vehicle, you can go more often. But if you must, go with a truck V8 4X4, as mentioned above, I've seen some ramp issues etc. ice, mud, steep, rocks on back lakes. Plus the safety for your family and others on the road. As Billy Bob says, good advice. OH"" and one day you will be down sizing when you see the picture"
588725,Gerry,2011-06-01 11:05:00,257,"I would never tow anything with a front wheel drive vehicle. Firstly, car companies exaggerate towing capacities by at least 25%. Caravans and the like have very weak trannys, brakes, etc when these need to be beefier for towing. Secondly, front wheel drive cars are dangerous. It's one thing to pull something, it's entirely another matter trying to stop or maneuvering in evasive situations. Thirdly, as one poster mentioned, pulling up a wet ramp is often problematic and makes others curse at the one who is spinning their tires and can't get the boat pulled out, tying up the ramp. Yeah, there are those who say my friend is doing it, or I've seen someone pulling a 20FTer, that doesn't mean it's safe. If it's not safe then you're a menace to yourself and others on the road, including me. I've always said that if you're towing something heavy, then tow with something heavy. IMO, the only safe way to tow is with a full size pickup and preferrably with 4x4....the longer the wheelbase the better."
588748,scugpg,2011-06-01 12:54:00,1373," That's what I thought as well. As for towing 2000lbs with that Van, I wouldn't do it. In my experience towing about 1/2 or less the rated max capacity is comfortable limit at least with the vehicles I've towed with."
588752,bigbuck,2011-06-01 13:16:00,2449,"Stick to 3/4 of the towing max. You have to remember that as you may have enough power to get it going, stopping is the big issue when it comes to towing. Also, make sure you have a towing package installed (big tranny cooler, those Chrysler trannies tend to be pretty weak). Make sure your trailer has at least surge brakes to help in emergencies. I don't believe you should be towing a tandem axle trailer with a minivan but I may be wrong. You also limit yourself to where you can launch, on a gravel ramp, you WILL get stuck, you need good concrete ramps to launch/retreive easily. The two launches I use are both concrete, I learned my lesson with gravel the first time I launched the boat (forgot the drain plug, thankfully the water was fairly warm). I tow my boat (around 3400lbs with trailer and loaded) with our Olds Silhouette that has a 3500lb towing cap and I don't tow when there are lots of cars on the road to be safe. Panic stops aren't fun esp. on the 400. My next vehicle is going to be a 1/2ton pickup when my car finally gives up the ghost. As for Legend boats, they seem to be fine, just make sure that you upgrade the motor on it, they keep the cost down by putting a small motor on, if you stick to a minimum of 75% of the rated hp capacity of the hull, you should be fine. Maxing it out really helps with resale down the line, it's a hit up front but at the end of the day, it makes it a more saleable boat.  Good luck with your purchase, please remember that BOAT stands for Break Out Another Thousand."
