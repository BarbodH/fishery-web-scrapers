590273,ryan a harris,2011-06-06 16:51:00,17,"Last Saturday I went into Lebaron (Mississauga location) for some line and check out their stuff. I have been shopping that store since was a kid, about 25 years now( I can even remember their old location on Dundas). They always have good deals on rods when I go. Well this time I was checking out the ""bargin bins"" & I picked up a Fenwick HMX 6'6"" 1 piece Med. casting rod, the sticker read $60. So of coarse I purchased it, too good of a deal to pass up right. Anyway I have an Abu Garcia 4600 baitcaster that I want to use with it, but it's a right had retrieve, I wonder if anyone would like to trade a lefty for a righty? If they are in the same shape.   Oh yeah, I'm pretty new to here, have been lurking for about 2 months now and I think this my 2nd post!!! So I'd like to hello to all of you, and I look forward to hopefully meeting some new fishing buddies this summer!!"
