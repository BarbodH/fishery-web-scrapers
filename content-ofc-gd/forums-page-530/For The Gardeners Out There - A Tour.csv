589808,Leecher,2011-06-04 21:03:00,7832,"First Saturday in a while I haven't been out fishing.... so today, spent my time in the back yard and thought I'd share some of the work I did  Planted additional veggies for the garden and cleaned out the flower beds of weeds  Don't get me wrong.... fishing is always in the back of my mind and my tackle is always ready    To begin.... my favorite place of all, where I sit down with coffee in hand first thing in the morning   This pic was taken this afternoon but early morning, the tree brings shade    My second favorite place to be in the afternoon.... very comfortable    Tomatoes      Sweet peppers    Garlic    Cucumbers and zucinies        Wax Beans.... just planted the seeds... not showing yet    Additional pics - little tour                  Now my wife just handed me a Seagate 1.5TB external drive.... guess what I'll be doing now  Hope you enjoy!!!

589811,Joey,2011-06-04 21:54:00,9122,Very nice backyard and garden you have there.  Thanks for the tour
589860,dave524,2011-06-05 01:58:00,4508,"Very nice, I'm a little more laid back on the pest control, the pests are pretty laid back too    Actually other than a few beet and carrot tops there is really no damage. I do have a larger garden so I can afford to share.  "
589866,ctdd2006,2011-06-05 02:08:00,531, How do you find time to fish?  I thought my yard kept me from my boat!?
589876,Leecher,2011-06-05 03:20:00,7832, Thanks Joey!!! Been working my butt off to rid the weeds back there.... I still have some but it's more manageable now   Thanks Dave!!!  Nice shot of the rabbit laying back   I work on it during the week and sometimes on weekends but that doesn't happen very often
589888,pikehunter,2011-06-05 09:46:00,1659,Nice!  And I like the fact you are reasponsible too! Not one of those peppers or tomatoes are going to escape from their cages.
589964,vinnimon,2011-06-05 18:46:00,2593,Nice  job jacques I like it

590037,ehg,2011-06-05 23:39:00,2666," Garden fresh produce is the best. All the hard work will be worth it as you harvest here and there. Wait till late summer, fresh fish and garden produce will rock your world.  Funny thing last year a cantaloupe seed must had been in my compost soil. When picking tomatoes and such i found one. It tasted great! entirely a surprise.  Nice going Jacques"
590068,kenzy31,2011-06-06 00:57:00,261,"very nice garden Leech!!  i just started my very first veggie garden this year.  i really like the screening you have to keep out the varmints, i may need something similar as i have a mole/vole issue in my yard.  here's a few pics of mine.                in the pots are 2 cherry tomatoe plants, habenero peppers, and ceyanne peppers. in the front are 6 cucumbers, in the left row are green and yellow beens. the back half of the centre and left rows are ring of fire peppers (ouch  ), pimentos, sweet red peppers, and sweet banana peppers!!

It also keeps squirls and cats out  Thanks for sharing the pics of your work   Thanks Corvy!!!   Thanks Julie!!!
590269,Rod Caster,2011-06-06 16:37:00,5784,  Your volleyball net is installed all wrong!  NOthing better than fresh eats from the Garden. Long ago you would have been a hunter AND a gatherer!!

590425,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-07 00:26:00,4399,"Nice yard, a labour of love I am sure!  Backyards are special places and it`s great to sit in the yard and enjoy a cup of coffee first thing or watch the birds at the feeder! Outside of my trailer my yard is my absolute favorite place!!!  "

590625,blaque,2011-06-07 15:17:00,2419,"Leech, i only wish i had half the green thumb you appear to have. I was born with black thumb unfortunately"
590672,Leecher,2011-06-07 19:44:00,7832, Thanks Blaque!!!  Over the years I picked up a tip or 2.... the most important thing is the earth and how you prepare it.  I use sheep manure and mix it in real good before planting with some bone meal
