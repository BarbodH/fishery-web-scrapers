590474,mercman,2011-06-07 02:09:00,7054,"I know this is probably a dumb question, but i really dont know the answer. Can i semi clean fish(take off head and guts) then freeze perch or bass etc, then thaw them later and fillet them? Is it more difficult to remove the skin from the fillet? I get off the water late sometimes and am too tired to start filleting fish.  Paul"
590477,Joeytier,2011-06-07 02:12:00,3990,"I've done this a few times.  Just remove the head and guts, and make sure you freeze them in water.  Keeps the flesh nice and firm."
590482,mercman,2011-06-07 02:15:00,7054,  Regular tap water?
590485,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-07 02:16:00,1107,we do it all the time Paul I even just fill the cooler with ice ontop of the fish whole and clean them the next day and I find they are easier to clean half frozen works for me .
590486,miller,2011-06-07 02:17:00,223,i find if you freeze fish then unthaw to fillet the meat is much more soft/mushy which made it harder to fillet. i never tried freezing it in water though as joey suggested.
590488,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-06-07 02:19:00,1107,  Thats why I use ice not a freezer they don't freeze solid just stay really cold.
590496,mercman,2011-06-07 02:33:00,7054,"Thanks guys I will give it a try next time. I've been cutting my time on the water, knowing that i have lots of fish to fillet when i get back home."
590500,Nipfisher,2011-06-07 02:40:00,2449, We all feel so sad for you Paul.
590503,HTHM,2011-06-07 02:44:00,4082,You braggin' or complainin'?
590507,mercman,2011-06-07 02:48:00,7054," Just perch Albert, nothing fllashy  That will come later when Bass opens"
590513,dhickey,2011-06-07 03:15:00,1038,I always freez fish in water . It keeps the frost off them. When you thaw it put it in a strainer with a damp cloth on top in the sink.  
590547,Billy Bob,2011-06-07 10:41:00,5865,"Merc if your going to clean them the next day or two you can just refrigerate them whole (wrapped in newspaper) until then....many fish clean houses pack them in crushed ice and just keep them cold until they are filleted....  Years ago when we still had 2 active smoke houses on Lake Erie that also sold fresh fish fillets...one in Dunkirk, NY and the other one about 15 west in Barcelona, NY I went with my fathers friend as he wanted to purchase fresh walleyes....they had them on the fin...the complete fish packed in crushed ice...Steve paid for the live weight of the fish and then the man filleted it for him....I'm sure that's exactly what you get when you pick out those nice fillets that are displayed in the display counter in the front of the store.  But anyways....yes, I have just wrapped them in newspaper and refrigerated them until morning MANY times when we night trolled for walleyes. Couldn't tell the difference except they were less slimmey because the newspaper soaked a lot of the slime up.  Bob"
590549,mercman,2011-06-07 10:54:00,7054,"excellent!!  That takes the pressure off for sure. When i get tired, i tend to want to go too fast, and start botching up the job.  Thanks all!!  Paul"
