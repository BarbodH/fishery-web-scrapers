590337,spoon,2011-06-06 19:00:00,74,"I tried Sufix 832 in 80 lbs for the first time Saturday morning. Line snapped throwing a 5 oz lure, line broke above the knot. One hour later line snapped again throwing a 3 oz lure, line snapped at the knot. Trip got kind of expensive at $30-$40 a lure.  Also, I've never seen another braid loose its color as fast as 832, almost all its color was gone after few hours of fishing.  I was afraid that Gore fiber might be a hype to lure us in, I guess they ""Caught"" us. Be forewarned."
590343,msp,2011-06-06 19:14:00,1336,My Sufix 832 is already white after 5 weeks of fishing. I dont think it casts any further than P.P. Any freshly spooled reel should cast far. We will have to see how it performs when temps drop below freezing. I suppose its all about personal preference.
590344,umKthxbye,2011-06-06 19:16:00,247," Thats strange. I've thrown some heavy lures an ended up birds nesting so the lure just whipped right back at me, I've got my 50lb 832 tied to a 20lb Fluorocarbon line with a double uni knot and have never have knot failure and I'm pretty aggressive when I cast. Even getting snagged with just the 832 tied on to a lure the hook bends before the knot or line does. My line has been getting fished 3-4 times a week for 3 months now has only lost the lime color of it but it's still looking yellow now. Maybe you got a bad batch. Or it's the knots your using. Ive been using a polamar and wet my line when I cinch it. Sucks that you lost lures cuz of that."
590345,manitoubass2,2011-06-06 19:16:00,11391," I guess it's give and take. From everything I've read, experienced and heard, seems inconsistency might be the issue. My experience has been great, and I've had zero issues with breakage. Haven't broke my line in close to three months.  Sounds like your experience is horrible though"
590379,GBW,2011-06-06 21:30:00,8460,"looks like i'm sticking with my spider wire braid for a bit longer, tks for the info. folks."
590405,GoneFishin,2011-06-06 23:19:00,349,"I didn't have any problems with 832 before in the spring when using 30lb. It held it's color well, and casts awesome. We also noticed it didn't retain as much water as PP when we were trolling in below freezing temps, which helped minimize freeze up. (could mean it might sink slower..) I just bought 4 more spools at CT though and will probably go back before the sales over to get some more. Hopefully they aren't putting a bad batch on clearance"
590574,bucktail,2011-06-07 12:28:00,1857,"I was going to email them and ask about the colour issue but I went on there web page and could not find a ""contact us "" link. Does anyone know one?"
590582,GBW,2011-06-07 12:47:00,8460,http://www.rapala.ca/contact/contact_us.php
590585,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-07 12:52:00,4399,"I used it for a hour on Saturday and my hands were green and the line is already starting to fade badly, there is obviously an issue. I have never had this happen with other line, let us know what Rapala has to say about it!"
590134,bucktail,2011-06-06 03:37:00,1857,"Finally got out to put the new Suffix line and the Sebil Swimmer to the test.  The Suffix 832 inline behaves much better out of the box then Power Pro or Fireline, less memory and stiffness the the other 2 braids and better casting. The draw backs are the one the colour bleeds quickly and I ended up with green hand! Also by the end of the day throwing big cranks it appeared to lose some of its shape and started to flatten like Power Pro does after a while. Over all I would buy it again and would rate it higher then the other superbraids.  As for the Sebile Magic Swimmer .. I used the 7inch silver and bkue herring colour sinking model. Looks great in the water at a medium retrieve.  3rd cast I get a nice 15 pound pike coming in late on the retrieve and and blow the hookset as he nipped at the tail.  Had a nother fish blow up on it before leaving.  Great start but my bad hookup % continues. Couldnt tell if it was the fish or me again.  Good review tho , definatly worth it.   Darren"
590136,lookinforwalleye,2011-06-06 03:43:00,4399,"I tried the Suffix this weekend aswell for the first time and I too had green hands, overall I really did see what all the hype was about. If I had to choose between the PP and the Suffix I would take the PP!"
590165,fish_fishburn,2011-06-06 10:47:00,1311,"I have 30# on my Stadic 4000 and its a nice limp line that casts well. I like it and didn't notice the colour coming off on my hands. Would definitely buy it again, good price point for this product as well."
590169,umKthxbye,2011-06-06 11:12:00,247,I've been using 832 lime green for about 3 month and haven't had any color come off on my hands. The color fades but not as fast as the other lines. I'll double check the gaps of the line on my reel with the one on the spool. I'll keep using it.
590173,singingdog,2011-06-06 11:45:00,1047, You might try a dressed treble on the tail....that sometimes gets the tail biters. I have put them on a few jointed swimbaits without affecting the action at all.
590174,coreyhkh,2011-06-06 12:11:00,163,"I have been using 832 since April and have caught over 300 fish this year using it, I would not go back to powerpro. Also I have not found that the line fades much it still looks almost new even after 2 months and nearly being used daily."
590179,bucktail,2011-06-06 12:27:00,1857,"Im going to try that trick of putting on a dressed treble I think! Good idea. As for the colour bleed maybe I got a bad batch, my hands were as green as if I had been weeding the garden., and the line on my reel looks like 3 year old power pro now. Still like it tho and definatly recommend it."
590194,Dan668,2011-06-06 13:12:00,1120,"I like 832 better than powerpro. I wasn't a fan of 20lb daiwa samurai, bought 55lb, hands down my favourite braid."
590199,FrankTheRabbit,2011-06-06 13:25:00,479,"They're having a sale at CT for a spool of 832 150yds for 15 bucks. Dunno if nit's still on sale, but check it out."
590202,Garry2Rs,2011-06-06 13:41:00,1425,"I have 30 pound on one reel and 10 on all my spinning reels. I haven't notice any colour on my hands, but with small diameters like mine there wouldn't be that much anyway.  By now we know that no superline will hold dye.  PP uses wax as it's colouring, Fireline uses dye and paint...At least this stuff is soft right out of the box and doesn't have to be ""broken-in.""  With the follower-late striker thing...There is an old Rapala thing that if the fish is accepting the bait it will hit it in the middle...If it's on the tail hook either the baits too big, or the wrong colour.  this isn't pure science, but it's worth considering.  In my lake, I caught a pike on a five inch Magic Swimmer first time out and several more hit four to five inch Husky Jerks, Live Target Smelt's and Long ""A's"" etc.  The fish we ate had a belly full of 4-5 inch Minnows."
590206,manitoubass2,2011-06-06 13:52:00,11391,"I've got Suffix 832 on 4 different rods now, and still love it. I did get one box where the line bled color and faded super fast. But the others where fine.  I still absolutely love this line though"
590209,johnnyb,2011-06-06 14:11:00,3413,"No colour bleed from my Suffix....really like it.  When you see those followers, look away and wait till you FEEL him   Very interesting bit from Garry about fish accepting the bait though....I like that."
590213,BillM,2011-06-06 14:19:00,17367,"A bit of green water on my Calais after the first few casts, but nothing like PPro..  Also noticed a waxy black substance come off the line while I was filling the reel.  Really enjoy the line, definitely casts further then the 20lb Suffix Siege I had on there.  No complaints from me."
590228,FrankTheRabbit,2011-06-06 14:39:00,479,I've only had colour come off from the braid when I was spooling my reel. I'd hold the line between my fingers as I reel in and I noticed a mossy green colour afterwords.  I was using the 30lb test on my spinning reel tossing a mepps spinner and a small tube jig. The line came off nicely off the reel.
590246,Rod Caster,2011-06-06 15:22:00,5784,"I tried the Suffix 20lbs on my Soron StX20 and was getting consistent knots and loops, even as I pared down the amount of line on the spool. I switched back to PP and had no issues. No more suffix for me...looks like everyone else is happy with it though."
590247,mercman,2011-06-06 15:24:00,7054,"I put some 832 on my main reel this spring and am impressed with how it casts, and how sensitive it is.i also rec'd a reel of Elite and a reel of Siege monofiliment by Suffix. Anyone ever tried these 2 lines?  "
590248,ckrb2007,2011-06-06 15:37:00,449,"I also noticed the green residue on my Revo STX and hands this weekend. Other then that, I was impressed with it's performance. I'll definitely be picking up a few more spools."
590250,manitoubass2,2011-06-06 15:46:00,11391," Are you talking about Suffix Elite? If so I didn't really care for it too much. It's better than Spiderwire and camo braid, but not as good as PP or 832.  I still have lots of it around, and only really use it in desperation for a day or two."
590256,mercman,2011-06-06 16:01:00,7054,"  No, the Elite and the Siege are Mono filiament lines. I recd a roll of each in a promotional package and wanted to spool either on my Ultralite setup. They gave me and 10lb Siege and an 8lb Elite."
590279,johnnyb,2011-06-06 17:02:00,3413,Canadian Tire still has the 832 on for $14 and change....at least in Oakville....I grabbed some 50lb today.  Stuff definitely seems darker on the spool than the 30lb I picked up earlier...will be interesting to see if it fades.  My 65# powerpro that I bought close to ten years ago is finally getting retired
590285,Lunkerhunter,2011-06-06 17:20:00,455,"i put 80 lb on my revo toro, used it this weekend and had green hands after i was finished, also noticed it dripping off the reel several times.  i have 40 lb on my jerkbait rod.. also noticed i had a green thumb at the end off the day.  i have 10 lb on my walleye rod... didnt notice the dye although it was a spinning reel compared to baitcaster.   great line though, definetely like it better than powerpro"
590291,ehg,2011-06-06 17:32:00,2666,"Just bought a new Abu Garcia baitcaster to replace a retired 13 yr. old Quantum Iron baitcaster. The Fireline from the old reel i put on the new reel. So the stuff from the bottom is now on top, this Fireline despite being 13 yrs. old is looking brand new  . No need for the Suffix. Good to hear the fish were chasing the Sebile Magic swimmer, thinking of buying a Storm Kickin' minnow which is sort of similar swimbait. Gives me a bit of confidence in rubber swimbaits for musky before even using or buying."
590292,JoshS,2011-06-06 17:33:00,729,I tried the 832 for the first time the morning... It definitely handles great out of the box and casts very well. Going to give it a good go the next couple days but so far so good.
590298,manitoubass2,2011-06-06 17:41:00,11391," Sorry mercman, for some reason I was thinking of Sufix performance.  I've never used the two mono's you mentioned"

There is a soft version, but I found soft swimbaits didn't last very long around toothy critters. Garry2R's"
