Started at 3pm and finished by 6pm.... 4 for 4 2 Kings (16 and 19 Lbs) and two bows both under 10 Lbs.  2 of the fish were on spoons and for the first time got the other two on Atomic fly and flasher. 100-200' of water 55' down and 115' on the wire dipsy with the fly.  Temps were very high both surface (62) and down (46-47)  My younger son was with me and while I was trying to put the boat back on the trailer and he was chasing the Canada geese (of so I thought) he decided to go for a swim at the launch while chasing a wooden stick floating by the dock. Oh well no problems just that he got a bit wet and rode home naked and covered with a blanket. It was probably only 3' deep and he was still with his life jacket...so just a bit of excitement for the end of the day .  Here is the shot of the three we took home...let the biggest King go...    Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

590515,SlowPoke,2011-06-07 03:26:00,2984,LOL!!! That'll be gone by tomorrow. I'm surprised those kids don't have fins and scales with all the fish they eat!   Well done again Emil. Sorry I couldn't be there today; too much on the go today and off to Moncton again tonight.
