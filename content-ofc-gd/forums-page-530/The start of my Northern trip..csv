484046,solopaddler,2010-07-10 11:26:00,8605,"Wow what a great trip Ron!, thanks for taking the time to post."
484057,Guidofisherman,2010-07-10 11:51:00,206,"Hi Ron: Loved your trip and great photos, including the underwater ones. I especially like the brook trout photos. I see you caught one of my tagged fish #1789. I originally tagged it on May 28 and it measured 21' and weighed 3.5 lbs. Let me know if you kept any stats on this fish. I hope you turned in the info to the MNR as it helps track the growth rates and population health. You can send the info to me or turn it in yourself. Here is the link. http://members.shaw....greporting.html That is one great fishing trip with all the species. Great work! Alan"
484341,ehg,2010-07-11 15:56:00,2666,WOW! Is there actually more to this trip to be posted?  What an incredible post thus far. Looks like you reached the pinnacle of freshwater fishing in Ontario. Thanks for posting!
484465,irishfield,2010-07-11 23:16:00,26272,Some real nice porn there Ron !!!  Guess my invite got lost in the mail....
484475,Handlebarz,2010-07-11 23:31:00,3790,Love that under water shot of the Musky I think I need one of them cameras

590054,irishfield,2011-06-06 00:15:00,26272, Guess it happened again...
590060,danc,2011-06-06 00:32:00,4677,15 Brookies landed on a day trip yesterday in my back yard. Please catch all of the pike up here and take them home with you. I'd sooner deal with a toothache than catch a pike.
590064,trapshooter,2011-06-06 00:51:00,1234,Awesome!!  Great fish and Pics!!
590067,green&orange,2011-06-06 00:55:00,31,  Agreed!
590074,WeedLine,2011-06-06 01:10:00,322,Awesome report and big fish there guys. Well done. Those are some nice specks
590075,danc,2011-06-06 01:14:00,4677,Keep in mind that this post is a year old.
590115,corvette1,2011-06-06 03:10:00,1765,awesome trip
482505,Ron,2010-07-05 13:44:00,1683,"I will start off with some photos of our fishing trip up North. Perhaps if I get time I will do a write up about our trip afterward. These are just some of the photos from one camera. There will be more to come including video, you have got to see the videos!  A 10 day trip tallied:  Probably 40 Brook Trout with 9 Brook Trout over 22 inches, largest being 25.5 inches. (about 7.5 lbs) Zero fish harvested. Dano caught 5 over 22 with a new PB @ 23 3/4"". In one day, personally I put over 100 Walleye in the boat (ya, a few were given the ceremonial drift wood sacrifice, along with a few cans of Beans and potatoes.) Dano was not far behind in the Walleye count and he also scored a new PB inland Lake Walleye.  Couldn't keep count of the amount of Pike caught but definitely some BIG GATORS were put in the Boat. Once again Dano got a new PB Pike @ 43"", you have got to see the shoulders on this girl. (pics coming soon).  I want to thank ""The Weekend Whiskey Fishermen"" (Dano, Keith and Jarrod) for a trip not soon to be forgotten. Special thanks goes out to Dano, had lots of giggles on the trip and can honestly say this has been one of my BESTEST fishing trips to date! Hey Dano, you ought to be in movies! ha ha ha (I can see a new fishing show appearing on WFN)  Cheers, enjoy the pics.  Ron...      The highly sought after trophy Whitefish, took almost the whole trip to finally catch our targeted species!                                                                  "
482508,Peps,2010-07-05 13:48:00,191,Wow!!!!
482511,BillM,2010-07-05 13:57:00,17367,"Ron, how's the water level out on the big lake?  From the looks of it, I'd say down 2ft or so?"
482512,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-05 13:58:00,0,INCREDIBLE!!! How much did a trip like that cost you????
482515,danc,2010-07-05 14:15:00,4677,Nice Ron. Too bad that I wasn't able to hook up with you guys for a few days. It would have been a blast for sure. This photo essay explains just why Northwestern Ontario residents don't do fly ins.  Maybe we'll catch up with you this fall??
482518,anders,2010-07-05 14:29:00,1168,Simply amazing!
482523,Spiel,2010-07-05 14:33:00,9065,"Well it looks like you guys had an awesome trip though you were definitely lacking one thing......ME!  Yes, I'm jealous."
482526,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-07-05 14:36:00,0,Lovin' the nip pics! That's one helluva trip!
482531,Joey,2010-07-05 14:47:00,9122,"Awesome pics Ron, I really like the underwater shot, I might have to get one of those cameras.  Can't wait for the full write up.  Joey"
482542,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-05 15:45:00,2690,All I can say is INCREDIBLE!!
482544,Spiel,2010-07-05 15:49:00,9065,"""The start of my Northern trip"" Wait a minute Ron, I thought the trip started with a phone call here to say hi to the Plummas while doing a drive by razzing at one of your buddies homes."
482579,Rich Clemens,2010-07-05 17:06:00,3131,Just the start of a trip ?    Catching fish like that would make an entire trip (or two or three) for me.    Thanks for taking the time to share the report and pics.
482590,Handlebarz,2010-07-05 17:47:00,3790,Dang how come you did not tell Jade about them fish last night???  That sure is one great start to a amazing trip Ron cant wait for the rest
482602,fishnsled,2010-07-05 18:25:00,3520,Very nice Ron! What camera were you using for the underwater shots? Looking to get one myself. Been playing around with a waterproof plastic bag housing and finding it a bit cumbersome. Looking forward to the rest of your trip.
482658,fish-miester,2010-07-05 20:54:00,864,"Im pretty sure i can speak for 99% of the people on here when I say, man  you make me jealous"
482674,Leecher,2010-07-05 21:33:00,7832,Absolutely phenomenal Congrats Ron and Co. Leechman
482678,PikeMolester,2010-07-05 21:46:00,428,I love throwing that exact Glidin' Rap
482750,Moosebunk,2010-07-06 00:52:00,3970,"That's quite a teaser Ron.  Getting me just jonzing for that northern trip of my own.  Water does look quite low in places.  Great post, thanks for that. Some stellar fish."
482760,Dutch,2010-07-06 01:15:00,831,Thanks for the great report - I gota get a GI Joe shirt like that!
482805,Ron,2010-07-06 03:23:00,1683,"Water was down on most of the lakes we fished. Nipigon was down about 3 feet.  I have never really figured out the cost of a trip like this. If I did tally it up, my wife would probably divorce me!  Your ears must have been ringing a more than a few times Dan. Not sure on a Fall trip though, we don't need to go as far now to find the fish we were catching.  I was thinking the same thing Joey. Seriously considering on accidentally driving over mine with the truck!   Would I do that? ha ha ha You would have fit right in Jester!  Now how could a person compete against anyone that catches a 49 1/4"" Muskie and taking home more than a few trophies for her efforts. Besides she would out fish me if Jade went up with us.   It was my buddy's camera and I think it was the Cannon Power Shot D10, awesome photos taken with it.     Thanks!  Cheers, Ron..."
482807,Bly,2010-07-06 03:26:00,1556,Excellent Ron!  Thanks!
482980,Terry,2010-07-06 20:19:00,14456,what a great trip  thanks for sharing
482993,Steve Piggott,2010-07-06 20:41:00,196,Were the pike caught on nipigon?  I see the back hooks had been cut off.Great photo now its going to be a long wait till May 2011 Planning a trip to nipigon next May. The plan is to camp on the islands for 10 days
482995,Tybo,2010-07-06 20:58:00,1373,"So, You would rather go north and do some great fishing. Then come to the Nip for beers and pike. So jealous."
483050,Duckie,2010-07-06 23:47:00,305,"I just had an orgasm.  whew. LOL.  those were AMAZING pics!  what a great trip you had!  monster pike, and that first smallie is MASSIVE!"
