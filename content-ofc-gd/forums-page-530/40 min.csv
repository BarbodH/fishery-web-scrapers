590030,GBW,2011-06-05 22:53:00,8460,"I went up to see my folks today as it was my dad's b-day.  So I packed my car with the kids, dog and fishing gear.  I left the Mrs at home as she had a lot to do for her other job (part time travel agent).  Got to the cottage, said ""so what's the plans for the day"" and I was told ""pull the hot-tub from here and out to the deck"".      So my mom looked after my kids while my dad and I took out a window and small section of wall and in 2 hours all was back almost like we never took it apart.  We all had some lunch, give my dad his b-day gift and then I'm asked ""are you going to go fishing now?""  My reply was ""well we are her for your b-day so it's your call"".  I got in about 40 min of fishing and I was rewarded with a 49.5CM walleye for my efforts of the day.  The ""Magic Grub"" worked again!  I was all freaked out when bringing the fish in because it fought like a 9LB SMB!  I have never had a walleye fight like that before!  I landed it (Bass tourney guy style) as I had no net with me, layed it on my new ""slot-stick"" and I was happy to see it was right there in the slot to go home for a feed, woohoo!  I did about 10 more casts and decided to head in because I had a meal and I was getting another sunburn.  When I get a chance I'll add the pic to the report (tomorrow).  I'm not sure what my dad appreciated more for his b-day.  The gift the kids picked out or the work done around his house/cottage?  Either way, I'm beat and ready for a shower, beer and bed.  Cheers.  Geoff"

590044,ketchenany,2011-06-05 23:57:00,3229,Better than pulling a wagon around at the fair! But you should have seen the kid's face.

590066,GBW,2011-06-06 00:55:00,8460,"At one point I swear I had a Musky on as they are in this area of the lake.  Maybe, but some tome times the looks in the wagon are far better.  Tks Paul, it was a busy day for sure!  I fell like a rented muel..."
