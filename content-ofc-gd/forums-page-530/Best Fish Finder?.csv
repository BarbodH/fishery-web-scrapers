Really pleased with it:  -easy to use for complete noob -GPS - track your route, mark fishing holes  -sharp color screen image even in bright sun for 'middle aged' challenged vision(for the money your friend could probably wrangle HDS 7 - larger screen)  -expandable - map chips, 3D add ons, network with other sonars, etc.  -lots of built in features that come in handy.  Best price when I was shopping was at Radio World and when extra rig was needed, RW had it to me in one day."
