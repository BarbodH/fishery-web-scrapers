1029610,irishfield,2018-06-12 04:48:00,26272,Leah's boat all spiffy'd up again in Egyptian Princess colour... 
1029612,lew,2018-06-12 09:55:00,12766,I still remember standing on the dock watching Pete catch the winning pike on his Jumla
1029613,John,2018-06-12 11:01:00,2956,I still have a few.... 
1029616,lew,2018-06-12 12:20:00,12766,"I forgot I had one on my old boat too Wayne, along with the original OF N sticker from days gone by. We sure had some fun times back in the day.  "
1029619,irishfield,2018-06-12 12:52:00,26272,"That was the ""second generation"" Jumla that Pete used though Lew, mfg'd by Avery! The original mystery bait originated on a BOQ gathering when Rick and I were fishing on a finger dock across from the Picton Inn and after Rick caught a fish someone asked what bait he was using and the rush was on to find the illusive Jumla in Egyptian Princess colour. A bait that never existed..."
1029623,lew,2018-06-12 14:34:00,12766,"Yeah, I was referring to the bait Avery made Wayne."
1029625,TJQ,2018-06-12 14:37:00,7806,Funny to see those Jumla Stickers.. lol.. on the day Avery Graduates with his Masters! - and Jaden also graduates with her Bachelors tomorrow!!
1029629,lew,2018-06-12 15:05:00,12766,"Great to hear both kids are doing so well TJ, it doesn't seem that long ago they were both so little.....or maybe it just means I'm getting old hahaha"
1029632,Terry,2018-06-12 15:10:00,14456,Ah yeah the memories what year would that be. The memory is the second thing to go.
1029634,Headhunter,2018-06-12 15:27:00,5703,We were up at Bernie's a couple of weeks ago and he had one out for us to peruse. Brought back some good memories of BOQ gtg's we used to have. HH
