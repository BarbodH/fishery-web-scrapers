1029433,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-07 21:32:00,8243,A famous OFCer. And I thought I was the only one. Way to go Kicking Frog. Is it out yet farsider? Do you have a link?
1029475,kickingfrog,2018-06-08 19:59:00,8333,Very cool. I haven't heard or seen this yet. I don't even remember submitting a photo recently. Was this online or in the magazine? Time to search. 
1029484,farsider,2018-06-08 23:21:00,456,Was the magazine.  Blurb with it said it was submitted by your brother. Cheers

1029705,kickingfrog,2018-06-13 19:17:00,8333,Well he's seen it. His two reactions: He thinks he's famous and he is not happy that they incorrectly said it was his biggest bass. His sister was even more excited and immediately asked when her photo was going to be in a magazine.
1029728,Rizzo,2018-06-14 02:05:00,4754,Tell him its fake news....media can't be trusted
