1029385,Woodsman,2018-06-07 01:29:00,1286,Great to know. Thanks.
1029418,smitty55,2018-06-07 16:09:00,928,"Tks, I'll have to check my stock. Great price for sure.  Cheers"

1029429,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-07 20:48:00,8243,"I was just there a few hrs ago, grrrrrr. Many guys call it Snake Oil, maybe, maybe not. I sleep better knowing I put some in. If you can read the fine print Seafoam says it can be used 1 to 1, now that would be expensive."
1029443,boombap,2018-06-08 00:21:00,310,"I've ran seafoam through the crankcase and gas tank of a old Honda CRV and it worked wonders. Same goes with my foxbody... ran it through the crankcase before a oil change and the car just plain ran better after some fresh plugs, the seafoam gunked them up pretty quick. My 50hp merc elpto gets a can of it every other gas tank. Edit: Thanks for the heads up.. will be stocking up soon."
1029455,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-08 05:11:00,8243,If Seafoam gunked them up why use it? I'm missing something.
1029457,AKRISONER,2018-06-08 10:19:00,5558,"canadian tire also gives back an additional 10% back in canadian tire money!  seafoam gunking stuff up? Never heard of it...i was a skeptic, didnt believe that a can of some brake cleaner was going to fix my 88 suzuki 15...sure enough one can and some ethanol free gas...changed the motor entirely. First  pull starts, smooth idle, way more power...I was sold"
1029465,KawarthaAngler,2018-06-08 14:47:00,273,Thanks for the tip!
1029483,boombap,2018-06-08 22:40:00,310,"It wasn't the seafoam that gunked things up. It was the seafoam doing what it does and cleaned things up, all that 30 yr old gunk in my unopened motor passed through did a toll on the plugs."
1029492,smitty55,2018-06-09 00:56:00,928,"Yep, and when it's used in  car gas tanks they recommend replacing the fuel filter due to all the crap it cleans up.  Cheers"
1029502,Lukasaurus,2018-06-09 13:02:00,19,Thanks for the heads up. I just ran out and I really don't want to pay the regular price.
1029520,wkrp,2018-06-09 19:51:00,656,Picked up my seasons supply this morning.
