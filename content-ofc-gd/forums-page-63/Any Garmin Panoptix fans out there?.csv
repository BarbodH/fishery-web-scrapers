1029730,b_cdot,2018-06-14 03:07:00,270,Looking at this option more and more lately. If anyone has any input whether it would be a good investment I'd like to hear your experience with it. I'm also curious if anyone has been able to mount the transducer to a Terrova.
1029731,DRIFTER_016,2018-06-14 03:22:00,10439,Their new Live Scope system looks freaking awesome!!!! But the $$$$!!!! https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/591379 I bought myself new Garmins a year or two ago. 
1029735,AKRISONER,2018-06-14 11:25:00,5558,"IMO where panoptix really shines is ice fishing...its just as good as anything on the water, but its leaps and bounds beyond anything when it comes to ice fishing. its a game changer."
1029737,Garnet,2018-06-14 13:28:00,2056,If you are tournament guy 360 or panoptic is necessary.
1029740,BassMan11,2018-06-14 13:41:00,583,Live Vu and Live Scope look amazing. Garmin is on the forefront of sonar innovation that for sure.
1029741,Lape0019,2018-06-14 13:53:00,647,"I am not sure I would agree with Garnet that 360 or panoptics are necessary but I will say they are cool. My tournament partner last year sold his 360 because you have to be essentially sitting still to get a clear picture. At least, that is what he found. I know a few guys with panoptics and they love it. One uses it a lot to look under docks for fish while the other uses it everywhere. and yeah, live scope looks awesome."
1029772,Garnet,2018-06-14 23:38:00,2056,Your partner should have worked a little harder at it. The 360 and panoptic guys are making good cast over and  over. Non user are lucky to get 20% good cast who wins this game.
1029792,mikeh,2018-06-15 03:44:00,824,"I am looking at new electronics also,I heard you can follow the contour lines with the hummingbird with a ultrex as well as spot lock. I think being able to follow the contour lines is an awesome feature."
1029793,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-15 05:17:00,8243,"I dunno. It seems to me as soon as the new technology is out it is a year outdated. But looking at the thing I sure would love me one. My Garmin's have always been my best electronics over the years. I still use a 23 year old black and white sonar. I use that for sonar and the Humminbird set on GPS. When I switch the HB to sonar to check the accuracy of the old, and I mean old Garmin it matches. HB shows a hook sure enough the old girl shows a nice fish image and a beeeeep beeeep, I wish a new huge Garmin like Big Dave's units were in the budget. Not this year. I'm afraid to ask, how much $$?"
1029806,DRIFTER_016,2018-06-15 17:28:00,10439,"I got them on sale. Ended up costing me somewhere between $1,500 and $1,700 all in for the two units. "
1029807,Terry,2018-06-15 17:39:00,14456,I have the  ECHOMAP 75SV Chirp  and just bought the Panoptix transduer for it
1029812,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-15 21:26:00,8243,"That is actually quite a fair price, no I should say great price considering a 5 inch Bird combo is going for around 500 bucks then you have to buy a card for it at another 100 or more depending on what maps you need. It would be tough for me to say no if a deal like that came up for me. All I would need to do is remove 1/2 of the new floor that was laid a few weeks back and return it to get the cash for the Garmins. You see another deal like that Dave and you have to let me know. Even if I no longer have the Bassassin I would need a new boat to justify the cost of the 2 units. It's kind of like my wife designing  a new kitchen remodel based on the new faucet style."
1029819,DRIFTER_016,2018-06-16 00:29:00,10439,"No problem OI. I'll let you know. My 9"" is chirp and the 7"" is the older non-chirp. I bought the 7"" for nav duty. It was on close out as they were being discontinued. The 9"" was on sale during boxing week."
1029847,Musky Plug,2018-06-16 22:41:00,398,"Just found this today, as someone said before new tech is quickly pushed aside by the newer tech. This is the newer version on panoptix. "
1029868,MJL,2018-06-17 13:27:00,2427,"I don't own a Panoptix unit (or a Garmin sonar), but I would love to try using it off a pier for staging salmon and trout from shore."
1029879,mikeh,2018-06-17 14:31:00,824,you forgot to mention your favourite fish CARP
1029924,PUMP KNOWS,2018-06-18 14:12:00,937,That would be very cool to see. I would love to buy one for ice fishing when the price starts dropping. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSzejb40idQ 
1029934,JoshS,2018-06-18 15:17:00,729,Man this is one category in fishing that progresses fast. Makes me want to hold off buying anything or make a lot more money!
1029945,BillM,2018-06-18 17:09:00,17367,This would be really cool..   You'd probably spend more time looking at the screen then fishing Mike!  lol!
1029958,grimsbylander,2018-06-18 18:44:00,3016,I'd like to try that out while bottom bouncing deep pools on the Niagara.
1029965,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-18 19:44:00,8243,"That's exactly what we did when I got my first Eagle Ultra 30 years ago. 3 guys huddled around the thing and no one watching until we hit a big rock sticking out of the water 3 feet. Duhhh. The 3 Stooges go fishing. It' true, you won't take on water with a big hole in the bow once you are on plane. The problem is the time you aren't running WOT."
1029976,MJL,2018-06-18 22:42:00,2427,"That would be true Bill. But considering that I do that ice fishing, I wouldn’t feel so bad.LOL      There’s a high probability that it will be stepped on or kicked off a crowded pier.   I’m patient and I can wait till the price comes down. Maybe.LOL"
1029988,BFSC Kevin,2018-06-19 13:06:00,1351,"Mike, Nike."
