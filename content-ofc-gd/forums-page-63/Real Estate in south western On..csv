Had a 100 year storm last fall that started the erosion of the lakefront. In order to reset the wall an excavator has to walk here in the water. Both the MNRF and the Long Point Conservation Authority approved my plan and issued the permits today. We can't put the machine in the water until July 2nd due to fish spawn, I have no problem with that, it is what it is. 3 weeks for approval from each beurocracy, (even spell check can't get that word). 3 weeks is fast, believe me. Hopefully we will put it on Com Free or Point2 by August 1st. Real Estate commissions are brutal. Brokers wake up every AM and their revenues go up by 3% a month because of the market. Great time to be an agent. 25 grand on 500K, not a bad day. If anyone is interested in a 1000 sqft. totally renovated, new furnace and central AC beachfront Lake Erie property where you can watch Small Mouth, Gar Pike and Carp spawn from the deck while having a Pop drop me a PM. Finders fee applies. I will put this on the classifieds Art."

My wife and I would visit for March Break. OL, if you are considering Spain, look in the Malaga area and specifically a town called Nerja. It is a beach town about 1/2 hour east of Malaga. 200 bars and restaurants that are in the down time during our winter. Lots to see within a couple of hours drive, menu of the day is $5.00 CAD and includes three courses and a bottle of wine. You can surf cast the Med, day trip to the Alhambra, take a ferry at Gibraltar and hit North Africa for the day. There is a ""Canadian"" village on the edge of town, it's a town house complex that is almost entirely filled with Snow Birds. Beats the crap outta Florida! HH"

A great option. We had a place in Fla. and sold before the recession then bought a place in Mesa Arizona for less than cheap during the recession, and sold last year, just too far and the US $ was a killer.

1029248,Lord Letto,2018-06-04 23:03:00,70,"On topic, anyone know the average or low end market price for a 5+ bedroom house, preferably in Waterloo region (rural/country area preferred)? My sister-in-law came home from somewhere Saturday morning & found a eviction notice (Notice to Terminate a Tenancy at the End of Term) with the reason being late rent payments, rent gets paid but normally just up to like 3-5 days late due to getting paid at the end of the week (Friday). She have had enough with dealing with landlords so she's looking at renting to own a house, we currently pay $1800/month + Utilities on top of that(Hydro, Water, Gas, ETC.) for rent & would prefer to spend a little less than that. We have until July 31st to move, I think she's looking at like $340k for a house but if a down payment is required I'm not sure if we could save 17k in time for a 5% down payment on a $340k house & a $1800-3600 down payment would only allow us to get a $36-72k house."

1029411,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-07 14:14:00,8243,"In KW a 5 bedroom home is nowhere close to 340K. That home doesn't exist sorry, anywhere in southern Ontario. You are talking close to or over a million.  Maybe a 2 bedroom townhouse for 340K, maybe. Go to Comfree.com  and search. close to 100% of all homes are listed there as Real Estate brokers also put their listings on Comfree. Being late in rent kills your credit rating,  3 to 5 days late is late. 1 day late is late. I would venture a guess she isn't going to qualify for a mortgage with only 5% down with the poor credit rating she now has. In a bullish real estate market that we have now rent to own is few and far between. I have had several tenants over the years. I depended on the rent coming in on time as I had mortgages, utilities, repairs, maintenance fees  and taxes to name just a few to pay on time and depended on that rent to pay them. I bet anyone would get pretty upset if their employer was 3 to 5 days late giving someone their pay. Same thing Leto. Sorry but I would evict her as well.  I'll leave it at that."

We are putting in an offer for a century home, actually older 1839, in Prescott ON. Nice area and fair real estate prices compared to anywhere in southern On. It actually has 5 bedrooms. 3 in main house and 2 bedroom rental apt. attached to main house. It was the housekeepers quarters before Canada became Canada. A solid stone Heritage home on new 10 yrs ago floor joists, main beams, solid footings and foundation.

Tough to hear, but they've cranked right down on lending rules, so that even if you could find a place for $340K, with no down payment and a rough credit history you'll be denied. Problem is the bank becomes your new landlord, and they don't put up with anything. My heart goes out to you, but your best bet is to find another rental with a landlord you can work with and begin saving up that down payment for the future. Easier said than done, I know."
1029427,AKRISONER,2018-06-07 19:42:00,5558,"lol $1,800 too much? The tenant that lived in my 700 square foot two bedroom apartment that I own was paying 1,850 a month. No storage locker and I live at lawrence and dufferin, technically north york and not the city of toronto. Most people with two bedrooms in the city of toronto are paying over 2 grand a month. A 1 bedroom apartment near transit in toronto is $1,200 minimum. 340k is your budget, you are going to need to move to sudbury or north bay..and even then you wont get 5 bedrooms.  Serious question, is there any particular reason you have to live in the GTA? Unless you have a really really great job, you can basically move the hell away and take a much worse job and have the same amount of money in your pocket at the end of every month because housing costs are so much cheaper away from the GTA. I heavily considered moving to North Bay, buying a house cash and then living with no mortgage and a pile of equity that I would invest. I would then take a job making 25% less and still have more money in my pocket at the end of every pay period. Only reason i decided to stay in toronto is because I dont know anyone in north bay or sudbury. If your whole family is looking to move, its worth considering."
1029430,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-07 21:07:00,8243,"I can't fathom living in the TO, Hamilton Niagara area with employment on the lower end of the pay scale. Why? Maybe to be close to family, friends maybe. It is more economical to move your entire family where rent isn't close to 2 grand. Post WW2 many young, and older folk immigrated to Canada and the US because cost of living was so high. You had a roof over your head but couldn't feed your family and vice versa. My Dad was born in Hamilton but when my Grandfather was sent to prison my Grandmother had to get her and her 4 kids back to Italy. At 20 my Father came back to Canada, 3000 or so miles from his Mother. Mom is from North Tonawanda NY, only a 75 minute drive. When I told them we were moving outside the area they didn't make a peep. As they say ya gotta do what ya gotta do. Letto you need to get out of Dodge(southern ON). My advice and a toonie will get you a coffee at Tim Hortons. Our offer was rejected 15 minutes after it was made. You guys know before the Lady that I share  kitchen with does.

I found a few unhatched chicks in my frying pan, what a stench. It must be nice to shop then ask ""How much."" I always paid cash before Interact or before they accepted VISA. I won't use Interact around here unless I have at least the same amount of cash in my pocket. We are still on land lines around here and it doesn't always work. I always calculate how much $$ the items were as I put them on the belt. I bet my wife as to how much, can't go over, come to think about it she owes me a few Samolians. Letto, the original thread I started was about moving to SW Ontario. You should consider SW Ontario. You can get a nice 3 bedroom home there for well under $200,000.00. Employment is tough. If a family works hard, very hard and pools it's money you have a chance at home ownership. Rents are nowhere what they are in Southern Ont. I've seen nice homes, nothing fancy for under 150 in fact. I know people that have cars in their driveways that total 150K. I know a few mortgage brokers that lend unsecured mortgages, you won't get 1 for 4% though, closer to 10%. 150K at 10% is about $1500.00 a month PIT. PM me if you wish."

The Algarve is hardly Portugal too... great tourist attractions and beaches but food and wine? Go to the north!
1029446,Woodsman,2018-06-08 00:59:00,1286,Lord Letto those prices you posted in most cases mean nothing. Unless you see the place and check it out completely they just could not be livable unless your happy with a dump needing extensive work? Or maybe right beside a train track? Listings are not always accurate. Fixer upper generally means total gut job.
1029447,Woodsman,2018-06-08 01:13:00,1286,"As for some of the places you listed? Atwood there is absolutely nothing there. Will need good transportation to get anywhere. Stratford at that price & location will be an old ran down place. Also on a very busy main Street. Dublin is about 10 mins from where I live. Place may be not bad but right on a busy highway in a place with nothing. No public transportation.  Virtually no services either for shopping, medical ect. Work opportunities there are almost zero but lots of work in Stratford about a 25 minute drive away. Better have your own car. Of the places you listed some may be not bad but in out of the way places & others in larger towns being far less of deal but with more services and some places do have public transportation. "
1029448,Tom S,2018-06-08 01:13:00,362,"To be very blunt, I don't think you're going to find a bank willing to lend someone in your situation money. And if someone is willing to lend you that kind of money run away from them because you're in for trouble. I'd recommend you look for an apartment to rent for yourself and your mother based on your income, somewhere with access to public transportation and maybe a better job market for yourself? Buying a house can't be a snap decision, you need a stable income and good credit at the least. Nothing wrong with renting until you can make the right purchase."

1029452,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-08 04:01:00,8243,"Man my thread has become interesting to say the least. No problem though I'll take interesting any day. Letto when you said you were house hunting I presumed you all had employment. I don't have any idea what OW or ODSP is but assume it is monetary assistance. Use the proper name once then go ahead and use the acronym, even what is supposed to be professional news media does the same thing, drives me bonkers. I don't know about the houses outside Hamilton as far as prices are, I know for certain the prices quoted for those places in Hammertown are about 1/2 of the market value, maybe less. The realtors advertise a ridiculously low price to get traffic from Toronto (T.O.herein to be referred to as Toronto), and fuel a bidding war. A close friend did the same last summer. A 3 bedroom on Magill St. where I had a tri plex rental 22 years back was advertised at $299,900.00. It sold for 540K and needed another 60K in reno's. No central A/C, oil furnace for radiated heat supplemented with electric heat, double brick with zero insulation. A freezer in the Winter and a Blast Furnace all summer. The house is over 100 years of and the basement always has 2"" of water in it. The foundation walls are stone on stone. The place hasn't seen an improvement in over 40 years. Knob and tube and a 60 AMP service that no Insurance company will insure for fire. Heck I sold my tri-plex for $230,000.00 then and my rental income was $2200.00 a month. What is shown on MLS often has nothing to do with the market value. Many of the houses I saw would probably need 100 grand to make it livable. Sweat equity though can save big bucks but materials are going up every day for no other reason other than they can to match the housing boom. To be blunt as well until you find good paying employment you shouldn't even be thinking about home ownership. I agree if living conditions with family are untenable Mom and yourself should rent a place on your own. One of the worse decisions one can make is to invest in property with Family. Even families that get along, sounds like yours doesn't. You will put what little money you can to contribute and never be on the deed. There are several agencies in Hamilton that I know provide good safe housing geared to income, Liuna is one, it's the Ontario Labour Union. Good luck going forward. And get off my thread. (just kidding Letto) Again good luck and happy fishing."

1028502,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-17 02:54:00,8243,".I mentioned earlier in the year we are relocating. We have an offer on a place in Chatham 2 blocks from the river, didn't get flooded last month. I have to tell you most all of that real estate in SW Ontario, Chatham-Kent, is the best buy in Ont. unless you go far north or north east of Ottawa. 1/2 hour from London and 1/2 hour from Windsor. Close to the 401 and 20 minutes from Erie. For a 3 bedroom,  recent reno'd 2 1/2 bath, tastily finished rec room, recent reno'd kitchen, an in ground pool, central AC,  2 car garage, 70X120 foot lot in a quiet mature neighbourhood you are looking at 250K, maximum. Want a place with an indoor pool we recently saw? $280,000.00, maybe. Want a project? Less than $175.000.00. There are dozens on the market. For 300K you get a 3500 ft.sq. McMansion. The unemployment rate there is something like 30% with the closures of car plants and ancillary plants. The Thames River runs through town with great fishing.The Detroit River, Lake St. Clair and Erie are 1/2 hour or so away. For anyone wanting to retire this is value beyond great value.  I feel for the guys out of work but that creates great bang for a buck. This is just a heads up for those retiring or downsizing. Out of work or very little work? Sell your home in Hamilton, Niagara Penn. or TO and buy 2 or 3 there and get into property management. Many students and workers commute to London. Even better value is New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. We just got back from house shopping there. Unbelievable what you can get for 250Kor less. The 2 1/2 month summers are an issue though, unless you go south from Nov to April. We can sell here and get a place in Chatham or out East and a very nice place south and put the change in the bank. Just some information we have learned that I want to pass on."

Would be nice to save a hour by routing through Chatham but for some reason I don't believe that would work. Times will vary some depending on start and finish points in each city.
1028513,Woodsman,2018-05-17 14:53:00,1286,Actually unemployment has play a big part in the area. Many of the good paying jobs disappeared a while ago(15-20 years ago). Good paying jobs in the area have never rebounded to the previous levels. Real Estate prices dropped and has not fully recovered. Many of the workforce has moved from the area which reduces the local unemployment rates.

1028526,lew,2018-05-17 20:35:00,12766,My brother drove across the prairies years ago and said it was so flat he could see the sun set & sunrise at the same time LOL
1028527,DRIFTER_016,2018-05-17 21:22:00,10439,My dad just moved to London. Not cheap at the old folks homes there. Or anywhere else for that matter. Costing him $66K per year to live there.
1028534,Jmeyer,2018-05-18 01:13:00,83,"I live close to Chatham and have worked in the new divisions over the last 20 years. Over the years manufacturing suffered and for a good stretch of time building on spec didn't pay because the market wasn't strong enough for a return on investment. Today a new bungalow 1300sqft is 300-330k and rising, much like other parts of the province we are now seeing folk bidding up 10-20% over asking and this attributed to the influx of people moving in from the GTA. If I were you I would have a look at port lambton and sombra as well, there are some great affordable little places close to the water plus you have split the distance between Chatham and Sarnia with the bonus of the ferry to Michigan."
1028536,Rizzo,2018-05-18 02:23:00,4754,Was fishing Belle River a couple years ago and picked up a real estate guide at good ol Edna's diner....I was stunned to see houses available for 160K. That would not even buy you a lot in Guelph never mind a structure to live in
1028545,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-18 13:27:00,8243,"We are about 15K from what was The Nanticoke coal fired plant. Before they shut down the yellow streak that was in the sky generally went across the lake towards NY or Ohio with the prevailing winds we have and never effected us. So I don't see much of a problem being east of Detroit. Besides I grew up and worked my entire life in the shadows of the Steel plants in Hamilton and air pollution is something I lived with my entire life before retiring here. The numbers our Governments quote for unemployment don't really reflect the number of people unemployed. From those who's benefits have ran out, on social assistance or disability pensions that are no longer looking or pensioners that need employment to make ends meet for example."
1028546,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-18 13:31:00,8243,Exactly Rizzo. If there is a property for sale in Ontario 2 hours outside the GTA my wife has seen it online. The best value without going 8 hours north or north east is Chatham-Kent. There are many places for less than 200K that aren't in the slums and don't need renovations.
1028548,Thrilla,2018-05-18 14:25:00,164,"Between st Clair river/lake/Detroit river/Erie you have the best fishing in the province. Catch walleye until your arms are numb.  Everyone likes the area they grew up in. But I say go for it. Like you say the price is right and you will not be disappointed at the different options there is to fish down here. If your a hunter we have it all as well. World class duck hunting, deer, turkey in abundance, corn fed too  don’t tell anyone though we have been in the boats for near 2 months catching eyes while I still see reports waiting for ice to clear from lakes"
1028549,craigdritchie,2018-05-18 14:29:00,1586,"If you want a real eye-opener, look outside of Ontario. Our place on the east coast was 12 years old when we bought it ... large waterfront lot at a river mouth ... the river has a good run of sea-run brookies all summer long (up to 6 pounds!), plus the occasional Atlantic. House was in beautiful shape and move-in condition ... bought for $190k. Yeah, it's cold there in the winters. But anyone can buy a place like that plus a condo in the sun for half what a dump in Toronto costs. Better quality of life and great fishing year-round. Just sayin ..."
1028591,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-19 13:35:00,8243,We have family in Halifax. Going east was an option and still may be. Great value in Moncton New Brunswick.
1028594,woodenboater,2018-05-19 18:59:00,2277,"I find as I get older, price of housing is definitely a factor but I'm looking at health care as well. is there a very good regional hospital nearby. I'd have no probs living Sudbury/ North Bay area or Thunder Bay. I think most accept that if an ambulance can't get to you in 30 minutes, you're toast. On a lighter note, scenery also plays a large part for me. Worked in s/w Ontario when I was younger and no way in Hades am I heading back that way, no matter how good the fishing lol. Give me G Bay or the West Arm any day"
1028615,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-20 16:11:00,8243,Health Care in London from Chatham-Kent is a shorter drive than where we are here to Hamilton.
1028657,kenzy31,2018-05-22 16:01:00,261,Moncton -- the butt-hole of the Maritimes! Haha ?
1028660,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-22 16:25:00,8243,"Those times are based on my wife driving her car, not my truck. We drove out there yesterday to look at a different property. It took longer than Google map showed as we took the scenic route along hwy #3."
1028661,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-22 16:42:00,8243,"The place we put an offer in fell through. I had my own Home Inspector drive out there last Friday. The place is in dire need of work on the perimeter drainage and basement foundation. Not cheap. I expected that as the place is around 100 years old and unless done recently I expect a 100 year old place will need something major. We looked at 3 properties yesterday. Every week more properties come up in Chatham-Kent and those listed drop their price. We also did a few drive by's in St. Thomas, a nice place to live I believe, not big not small with 40,000 citizens, prices there are reasonable as well compared to GTHNA. Minutes to Port. Stanley. Great fishing on Erie, golf and who cares what else as long as the fishing is great.  Pt. Stanley has really boomed since I first went there in the early 80's. There wasn't a single parking space as it looked like everyone from London was there for the 24 weekend. New home surveys, singles and beach front condos. A buddy bought a house there in 81, a block from the beach. He paid less than $20,000.00. It has to be around 600K today, at least."
1028667,Woodsman,2018-05-22 18:36:00,1286,You may want to look in the Seaforth area. (icluding other small places in the area) About a half hour to Bayfield or Goderich on Lake Huron. London and Kitchener about an hour and Stratford and Goderich about a half hour drive. Prices are quite reasonable here compared to larger places. The reason we bought here was you got far more house for your dollar here.

1028673,Old Ironmaker,2018-05-22 20:16:00,8243,"Mom and Dad are paying about the same in Hamilton, if they eat 25 bucks worth of food a week between them I would be surprised.  A Filipino at the Steel Plant who's wife was a RN opened a nursing home back in the 80's, they are now multi millionaires that own a chain of retirement residences and nursing homes. . I will have to mention that to my Lady. Thank you. To me I don't care how much it snows as we don't plan on being in Canada during the winters. For the price of 1 months rental property in south Fla. you can rent a home in south Portugal, housekeeper included for 4 months, or longer. The most expensive dinner for 4 of us, more food that can be eaten, copious bottles of wine included at The Algarve was 25 bucks Cdn. in 2015. Spain can be just as economical. Something like 3 bucks a bottle in Portugal. I just need to talk my Dr. into giving me 4 months worth of meds."
1028686,Woodsman,2018-05-22 21:30:00,1286,Last year I missed zero days at work in Stratford due to road closures from snow. In the last 6 years I've missed about 6 days due to snow. Yes it snows here but not like 20 years ago.
