Friday we arrived around 230ish and decided to not hit the windy lake.  Instead, Bernie melted some lead to make some jigs.  We then painted them up....these things have always worked great for us and I need to re-stock again! Caught a bunch of smaller walleye on Saturday but Will caught the first 21” one I’ve seen come out of that lake in 8 years on Sunday.  Was a great catch to end the weekend. As always, thanks Bernie for hosting us yet again up there!  Stay tuned for the Sept 2018 edition....            "

1029684,bigbuck,2018-06-13 12:34:00,2449,Not a bad haul of 'eyes..... Those jigs look pretty cool.
1029839,Toronto_Angler,2018-06-16 16:55:00,698,Always enjoy the posts from the yearly boys trip. Seems like you guys have quite the tradition going!
1029841,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-16 17:22:00,8243,"Them thar are some nice healthy lookin' Piks, and nice pics too. You guys have an assembly line going. I have to tell you though on our trips on a wind or rain out days the last thing we would be doing is working. No paint on the table, more like paint thinner such as Jamaica 151 Rum. You guys are party animals, did you ever see the movie?"
