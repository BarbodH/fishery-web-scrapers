Woke up to rain and wind at 4am.   Drove down to the bay and it was waves and whites caps. Oh what to do. I know, go home, grab the 6wt fly rod and box of flies I have been tying up and hit a couple of streams. So this I do and off I go. I really wanted to try my Master Splinter mouse tie. I did, and it looks so real like a mouse skittering across the water. Watching the tail move was so cool. I only brought the camera this morning,so no go pro vid. Sucks, as it would of been very cool to see. Large mouth are going to crush them. So with that entertainment out of the way, I opened the fly box and grab a dry fly. It didn't take long to start hooking into small trout. Size didn't matter to me, no sir.. The fact my own ties were catching was.    So with that first fly out of the way, lets try another. This one was stupid on. When I posted these when I made them, I said they were a ugly tie. John said  the fish do not  care, and he was right.       Hey, come back here,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Put in down to unhook a fish and it got away.  And why was hooking up  ?   Maybe I,ll bass fish Sunday. Then again, I do not mind this fun. I had both streams to myself this morning. There was no sign of any others had been there.  "
1030203,Terry,2018-06-23 18:27:00,14456,nice going i went down to the lake any ways and you were right..lots of waves..i worked on the boat instead
1030233,Rizzo,2018-06-24 01:42:00,4754,beauty fish. I had a very soggy baseball tourney today. Did hit a creek this evening with the kids but ours only has chubs and shiners...not as glamorous as your trout

1030264,BillM,2018-06-24 17:23:00,17367,Nice Brian!  I'd take those over bass any day of the week
1030266,misfish,2018-06-24 17:51:00,29133,"Thanks guys. Should of strolled more today, as my go to smallie spot was abandon. Not a fish to be seen. Not a bed as well. Terry covered more water then I and was the same. Well that was up til I left. It is becoming sand filled for some reason. No longer the rocks and weed beds.  Time for largies with the fly rod next weekend."
