1029867,MJL,2018-06-17 13:24:00,2427,"I've only fished in Winnipeg for one evening in August of 2014. My dad and I were driving from Toronto to Vancouver.  I believe we tried fishing around St Vital Park on the Red River. Didn't catch anything, but did see 1 massive dead channel cat on the bank. If I had to guess, it was around 15-20lbs. Definitely bigger than any channel cat I've caught in Ontario (my PB is 13lbs 8oz). One day I would love to go back with my carp gear and a bunch of worms to try for the channel cats.  Bring insect repellent...The mosquito is Manitoba's provincial bird for a reason.LOL"

They warn you stay in while they spray the city for bugs by air.  Had to run from the car to the Hotel to not get eaten alive. 7 weeks? You couldn't pay me enough, good luck."
