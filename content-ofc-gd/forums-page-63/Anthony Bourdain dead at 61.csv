I would consider writing a screenplay based on your post, maybe we can co-write it. I paid the $29.99 plus shipping for the online screen play writing course. It might be titled ""How A Cook Was Murdered By CNN """
1029784,bigugli,2018-06-15 02:28:00,6138,And here is why many serious anglers no longer see any point in contributing to OFC

But can pass on advice. We actually planned an outing with 2 boats tomorrow out of Pt. Maitland but have electricians coming. A called in an old favour. And it is the sons of my electrician that is semi retired. Can't really say ""Here's what I need boys, I'm going fishing."" Doesn't sit well with me. Even M2B2 is AWOL. 30 posts a day and now nothing. I hope he is OK."

1029809,Headhunter,2018-06-15 18:41:00,5703,"Well, my first thought in hearing that he was gone was, hey, didn't he have a young daughter? Admittedly, I was pretty offended when I read Snidley's post, but, it did get me thinking. We don't know the dynamics of his life and family. I am beginning to wonder if his 11 year old daughter is better off without him. Not to sound cold hearted, but , being on the road over 200 days a year and all the other obligations, maybe she is better off without him? That doesn't mean that I am not going to miss his show... HH"
1029814,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-15 21:55:00,8243,"HH many Dad's, good Dad's, and I know a few personally, that are on the road to feed their families and keep a roof over their heads 200 days, or more a year because that's what they do. Some have chosen to not travel to be at home more. Take any professional athlete, it's what they do. I wouldn't know if any child would say they would be better off without their Dad's or Mom's, (Mom's travel for living too) in their lives, for the rest of their lives. Our niece is a young Mom, she is an actor, singer and dancer. She has to go where the work is. She is currently away out west for a stage musical. She is a great Mother, it's just different than most of us that did or do the 9 to 5. Working shifts is about the same, you see co workers much more than you see your families. I worked about 20 Christmas and New Years in a row, not much different than being away for weeks at a time. When we were kids we didn't see Dad for a week while on afternoons or night shift."
1029816,bigugli,2018-06-15 22:33:00,6138,"How much time does a child really get with their 9-5 parent? Add in the commuting, overtime, etc..... My wife worked days and saw little of the children except on weekends for the first 10 years. I worked steady nights and sacrificed sleep so I could be there for the kids for 6 years, but when I took on the day job there were months where the kids barely ever saw me during the busy season. That is a reality for all except the bureacrats and teachers."
1029817,SirCranksalot,2018-06-15 22:48:00,3291,I must say that I disagree strongly with HH. Snidley's comments are so beyond the pale that I am speechless!!
1029823,Sterling,2018-06-16 02:05:00,477,"Correct, both hogwash, it's nearly 50% for mental illness and 3-5% for homosexuality. Estimates vary but it certainly isn't 10%, in fact it's theorized that sexual orientation is a sliding scale. Direct contradiction? Think of how badly you want to avoid death at all costs. This isn't unique to you; every organism is programmed that way. Lucid minds don't simply manage to bypass this hardwired survival mechanism. Depression is powerful and happens with or without drugs. You seem to suggest that drugs and alcohol are chiefly responsible for these problems, to this I posit a few facts; I would suggest that there IS indeed a relationship between drug abuse and mental illness/suicide HOWEVER they are not the principal forces at play."
1029824,scuro2,2018-06-16 02:29:00,904,"Snidley, that's about as close as you can get to an ""old man"" rant hopefully without being 80."
1029830,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-16 10:35:00,8243,"Oh Snidley my friend, my oh my. If I didn't know any better I was listening to SOME of my southern Red Neck cousins in Georgia."
1029832,SirCranksalot,2018-06-16 11:51:00,3291,"OI---a little 'topic drift', perhaps, but I understand your extended family are fairly recent immigrants (second gen?). My question is 'how does the USA turn such people into rednecks?""  Is there some special school they get sent to that dims their brain??  Maybe Ignoramus U?? "
1029837,Snidley,2018-06-16 16:16:00,620,"Just to clarify my point about Nixon. The methadone clinics in DC were not intended to benefit addicts it was to relieve the  pressure of rampant drug related crime against respectable DC residents which included congress.  It was a short lived experiment that worked and then was discarded. Bordains issue was not pot, it was booze, pills, coke, AND FOOD. This by his own addmission by the way. The man was a wasted mess that filled his body with toxins  (including from the excesses in food consumption itself ) and tried to counter it with pharmacy. As usual it did not work out. It did provide the viewing public with a flawed but entertaining character who used humor, black humour ultimately, to build an audience.  In the end it was his character flaws led him to end his own life. That rollercoaster is what made Bordain a celebrity and we got to view it as a form of entertainment. It's a tradeoff that has been the source of art and literature since civilization began. As I said I loved the show but the suicide was the part that made him a jerk and it was definitly not a suprise, it was inevitable and I for one am not overly broken up over it. People today have great faith in media driven expertise which parades out experts in science like it parades out experts in economics, politics and  statistics. The problem is that these experts have lots of theories that are little more that opinions that dovetail into the preconcieved notions of what that media outlet and it's viewership are comfortable with. In the field of mental illness this has led to a conflation, in mainstream media, that what used to be considered character flaws are now excused as mental illness. That's how you get 1 in 3 as certified crazy rather than lots of people with significant character flaws that should be addressed with personal dicipline not pharmacy from the medical establishment and fawning empathy from the public. .

1029840,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-16 17:13:00,8243,"Great Grandparents and Grand Parents emigrated to the USA in the 1890's on Mom's side, Dads parents came to Hamilton in the mid 20's. Dad was actually born here in 27' and went to Italy in 1930, long story, but a good one, stuff movies are made about. Organized crime, murder, intrigue, suspense just no sex or Rock N Rolla. Anyway my southern relatives got their red necks from bending over in the fields and getting sun burn on the back of their necks, or bending over for some other reason, use your imaginations. These are not stupid people, stupidity is a DNA thing passed on down in the gene pool, they or shall I say some are intelligent individuals that do stupid things. Just plain ignorant and know nothing of the counties or towns in the same counties where they live. Some are medical Doctors and successful professionals such as a 1st cousin that is (or is it whom is?) a Lawyer in Lawrenceville GA. Their politics and religion of which I will not comment on other to say they are not only as far right of centre one can be they are always right as in correct and you are just dead wrong, opinions don't cut it down there, I'm just wrong. All wearing MAGA hats in their Christmas e-card photo, including the Grand Kids. It sure makes for entertaining Family Reunions. So entertaining I haven't gone in 10 years, why bother? Plus I think I'm barred."
1029938,jimmer,2018-06-18 16:08:00,2730,I'll bet many people suffering from mental illness are glad you are not working in that field.
1029978,Snidley,2018-06-18 22:48:00,620,"It's interesting that you guys appear to be in the ascendance. Today the UN's mental health unit has described a new ""mental illness"". It is for gamers that can't stop playing video games. So now pastey nerds can get meds for uncontrolable gameplayitis as opposed to say, the parents pulling the plug on the nitwits computer"
1029996,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-19 14:29:00,8243,"The above Snidley I agree with. Pulling the plug however may contribute to teenage suicide. So we'll put them on Ritalin instead, a much easier solution."

RIP his show was pretty cool, it showed a side of many places that few white north americans would ever venture too. One of the coolest eps was him hanging out in the favelas in Brazil...Im still amazed that he survived some of his trips considering most white folks cant enter those areas unscathed no matter how much security they carry with them."

1029494,captpierre,2018-06-09 02:44:00,2521,I liked him too. Had his demons and addictions.  Often hinted in his show about the meaninglessness of modern society.  Might be the second of more suicides of weathy types who have everything but lack meaning and hope.

1029499,pics,2018-06-09 10:40:00,1268,This one really bothers me.. His show was by far my favorite and he never hid his past which was refreshing to see. One of the best story tellers of our time..
1029504,Canuck,2018-06-09 14:38:00,491,"Talk radio on Friday was all about this, with lots of mention of suicide help lines all through the day.  I guess lots of worry that it might tip some people.  He was so well respected and seemed to have it all.  Very very sad. If you or anyone you care about seems to be depressed, talk about it.  What’s the worst that can happen by asking if someone is OK?  At worst they will know you care and you are there for them.  A life may depend on it."
1029505,craigdritchie,2018-06-09 14:41:00,1586,I was saddened to hear this as well. Really liked his shows.
1029508,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-09 15:26:00,8243,"When I was told I just could not believe my ears. I had to check reputable news outlets to make sure it wasn't some idiots idea of a prank. We have followed his shows pre CNN for years. We have read his first book, he started his career as a Busboy on Cape Cod as a teen. My wife always said he could be an international secret agent based on the remote destinations he visited, you never know, look at Chuck Barris of the Gong Show and the Dating Game. I did mention after his debut show this year on CNN a few weeks ago he looked terrible and he hasn't aged well in the last few years, he liked his libations to say the least. He got divorced from his wife just last year. She was an aspiring MMA fighter, I believe she was Brazilian, can't recall her name, she seemed like a sweet heart on film. That must have hit him hard. Based on his shooting schedule and book appearances etc. he couldn't have been at home much. That alone will take it's toll on anyone. I still can't believe it."
1029548,Snidley,2018-06-10 17:29:00,620,"Too much travel, alcohol, drugs, romantic entanglements, tatoos and trying to keep straight with leftist ideals as represented by CNN. It all looked rosey from afar but too much of a good thing combined with the stress of delivering a quality TV show did him in. It is a shame because I really admired his show/ lifestyle but I have little sympathy to a rich successful guy abandoning an 11 year old girl via suicide. Time to remind men that part of being manley is to take knocks without capitulation as people are depending on you"
1029622,SaugaPikeSlayer,2018-06-12 14:27:00,48,Those damn tattoos and ‘leftist ideals’. You never hear of rightiwing tattoo-free people committing suicide. ?

Hard to stop someone from committing suicide if they have their mind set on it.  You can offer help, an ear or a referral, (which we should all do if we know of someone thinking about it) but it ultimately comes down to the individual. He was a celebrity, so how much did we really know about him."
1029753,lew,2018-06-14 18:57:00,12766,Back in my many years as a fireman in Toronto I responded to plenty of suicides and for the most part they were pretty sad situations. One from many years ago that always stuck with me was a 16 year old boy who put a sawed off 12 gauge to his right temple and pulled the trigger and basically left nothing above his shoulders. He'd be a senior citizen by now I always wondered what could make  a young kid so sad that he would do something so drastic.

I probably missed some, sorry. I was almost a Fire Fighter like my Father in Law and Brother in Law were until I spoke to a few of the guys after I applied. Fires and rescue I could handle, we did that at the Steel Plant already, and saving Cats in trees. The stories about attending suicides and seeing children that didn't make it kept me at the Steel plant for 25 more years. Thank you all for your service guys. I have been too close to those that have committed suicide in the last 25 years, close friends, family members and co-workers. More than a few from the outside looking in I thought they had it made in the shade. Well off, successful, handsome, beautiful, outgoing, talented beyond imagine, family men and women. I just can't fathom how much pain someone has to be in to go to that extreme. I just can't imagine. I didn't know anyone I went to school with in the 60's and early 70's that committed suicide. We just didn't hear about it back then. Today it seems to be a daily event, and tragically most are young. And it is SNIDLEY that wins Jack Ass comment of the month, maybe year but it's still early enough for me to take 1st place."
1029771,Snidley,2018-06-14 23:18:00,620,"Well here's some more for you guys to chew on. CNN, the leftist bastion of rectitude and flakey spin on just about everything hired a man that told everybody that would listen he was a pathetic soak, druggie, and womanizer sent him out on a job that entailed loads of drinking, late nights, long trips away from his family and even, on the Uraguay show,doing dope on tv ( Uraguay has legal weed, BUT only for Uraguaians not tourists) .  He then started tattooing himself after meeting/marrying the cage fighter he susiquently ditched for an ""actress"" but leaving an 11 year old behind.  It appears nobody at CNN noticed. Now it's boo-hoo, this is mysterious, how could it go so wrong? The writing was on the wall ...er arms, back, neck etc and further evidence was in the expense account. Everyone is responsible for him/herself and I think that is only right BUT selective tunnelvision is what this case is about and you guys have it...bad.  The idea that one in 3 humans is mentaly ill is complete hogwash, as is the clain that 10% of all males are homosexuals and that alchoholism is a disease. Like drugs it is an addiction that is fueled by deliberate misbehaviour and recognizing that is the key to actually conquering the demon rum, coke, oxy etc.   Appologists think that you can coddle your way out of problems but I have yet to see that happen anywhere in the world. Back in the late 70's Tricky Dick Nixon addressed the unbelievable Washington DC crime rate of the time with methadone clinics and it worked. He made the move not for the addicts but for the victims, DC citizens that faced a daily barrage of begging, purse snatching, muggings and breakins. Methadone works for some addicts in that they can function and the free drugs severely reduce the need to turn to crime to finance their addiction. They are still a mess however.  At some point the rights of normal people should prevail over the rights of addicts to carry on as they please and when they die prematurly IT IS THEIR OWN FAULT. Sober respectable people have rights which include the right to be protected from criminals as well as the right to be free of the obligation to take care of self destructive idiots that continue to do activities that are obviously dangerous even life threatening. Bottom line I liked the guy and the show but he was a jerk for killing himself and there is no excuse that is acceptable other than it is your right to live your life as you see fit .  To CNN I say you are the home of distorted leftist spin as much as Fox is the home of rightwing distorted  spin. But next time you want a foreighn correspondent to fill out your programing take a few moments to think over what you are asking them to do and contemplate whether the job might kill them. So.... carry on festooning yourself with ugly cartoons that are permanent and possibly toxic, keep drinking/drugging to oblivion it seems a significant number of people are with you."
