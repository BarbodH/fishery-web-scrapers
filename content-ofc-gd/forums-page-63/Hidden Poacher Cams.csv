1030159,Cast-Away,2018-06-22 12:30:00,790,Why would you knock it down? Nobody should be poaching.
1030160,DanD,2018-06-22 13:02:00,2223,Waist of more of our money. Unless a poacher has his name tattooed on his forehead; it's completely useless. Oh Look there was a poacher here; 10 hours ago? Dan.
1030161,G.mech,2018-06-22 13:17:00,830,"Uh-oh.....it seems like a few members may have lost their sense of humour &/or sarcasm.   I don't think there is a camera inside that nest.....maybe something a bit more hazardous. That said, nothing our government does these days is too surprising and they probably would have tried this method if they'd thought of it."
1030163,BillM,2018-06-22 13:26:00,17367,"Come on guys, you didn't get the joke?  LOL!!!"
1030164,Terry,2018-06-22 13:38:00,14456,Wow i  knew it was a joke. And thought it was a good one.   Lol
1030166,Canuck,2018-06-22 13:48:00,491,????
1030168,OhioFisherman,2018-06-22 14:22:00,6623,"LOL, I think Bill Dance ran into one of those in his bloopers videos?"
1030169,Fisherman,2018-06-22 15:05:00,7201,Who is going to change the batteries..
1030170,SirCranksalot,2018-06-22 16:23:00,3291,It's a sting operation! 
1030171,ratherboutdoors,2018-06-22 18:17:00,132,it was/is subtly golden!
1030174,aplumma,2018-06-22 18:29:00,6896,Saw a guy shoot one with a shotgun once lots of survivors lots of stings as well .lol. On another note taxidermists love to use abandoned ones for bear mounts and will pay good money for them.
1030177,misfish,2018-06-22 20:29:00,29133,"True story  Walking a trail to a fishing spot early morning. I always like to walk slow and watch for the animals. One time I see a trail cam on a tree. Just curious as to what it was pointing to, I walked up to it. Looking around at the area, I  look up to see if I can see a stand.  , Bow hunter in the tree. LOL. No words were spoke. I just walked off like I never noticed him. On the way back, he was packing up. We had a good laugh. He said you know, I had you in my sights. I guess maybe he thought I was going to scoop his cam."
1030181,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-22 20:41:00,8243,"I actual got the joke, took a few minutes but I got it, tee hee. True story, of course. I had a painter here 2 weeks ago, he tells me there is wasps nests in the gable vent he needs to paint,  I sealed it 20 years ago. I tell him no I sprayed insulation in it, go ahead paint it. He puts the brush to it and the Wasps next crumbled. No wasps in it, they're Mud Wasps here, dozey little buggers, this place was full of them when I bought it. Nests behind the drywall 4 feet high. Never been stung by a Mud Wasp. "
