Here are some of the highlights from the weekend.  It was a great time and we can't wait for the long weekend to hammer some bass and hit some northern lakes for some monster bass! Campfire!   A few of these post fishing   Some of these of these for night caps (maybe the best whiskey I have ever had made in Sundridge).  Double shot with ginger ale in a mug is my favourite summer time drink   The view   Father and Son!  Jumping off the rock!   We got a few of these guys but not much bigger.   The drive home knocked out with the pup on his chest is priceless!   Overall it was a great weekend with my son and I can't wait for a week up north starting next Thursday! Cheers!"

1030093,lunkerbasshunter,2018-06-21 13:19:00,2585,Yeah its funny how a lot of people on here like the same things Cheers!
1030094,lunkerbasshunter,2018-06-21 13:21:00,2585,Im not the most exepeirnced crappie fishermen.  I was told its normal for them not to really bite till July but last year we smashed them in early June so not sure if it was just a weird year or what.
