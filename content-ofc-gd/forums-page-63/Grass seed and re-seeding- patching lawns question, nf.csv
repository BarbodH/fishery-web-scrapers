I see grass in Hamilton and Caledonia that looks burnt. Maybe we have so much moisture in the air next to the lake and plenty of shade from the big trees on the property. Come to think of it we really don't have grass, more like 5 kinds of green weeds."
1029711,HTHM,2018-06-13 20:23:00,4082,"If you are going to seed, do it the last two weeks of August. Otherwise, just sod it,  water initially, every day for the next 7 days, every other day for the next 7 days, then every 3 days for the next 7 days. (At least two inches of water per application) The sod farmers have access to seed and chemicals that the common homeowner simply can't get. Source: have played in the dirt professionally for over 30 years."
1029713,AKRISONER,2018-06-13 20:30:00,5558,"i spent 3 years working in a cemetery regrowing grass on dug plots...the best method was first of all using the best soil you could by. No triple mix or any of that crap. you need something that is almost like straight manure, no sticks or other garbage...it should pretty much have the consistancy of potting soil. Lay that stuff down tick, then spread your seed on it...then take a roller to roll the seed into the soil. this keeps it exposed but allows it to germinate by not being buried. Then water is your friend, basically keep the soil damp at all times and cool. It doesnt usually work to well if its hot, it needs to be nice and cool out. That might be your problem is that its been too sunny and hot lately to get it going well. hopefully it works out for you! good luck. Also consider that your soil might have something wrong with it...bad PH or perhaps you are getting a bunch of salt on it from the winter or something? grass never likes to grow near salted sidewaks."

1029765,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-14 22:17:00,8243,"What type of roller would you use Akri? Can't agree more about the best soil. The stuff they sell like Scotts is more marketing than effective. If you have a connection with someone in the Municipality that has public Golf Courses or someone that works at a Golf Course they use the best seeds available, bar none. Grass is their livelihood. The stuff I used to get from my golf course grew on a Bowling Ball I tell ya'. Know any members of a course? They may be able to score you some grass. Not that kind."

1029811,aplumma,2018-06-15 20:38:00,6896,I have been using a product call grass seed mats from a landscape company. I lay it out and once the grass pokes thru I gently lift it and use it on another area. It is the only thing I have found that keeps the chickens from scratching for the grain. I also have a friend who works for a golf course and the seed mixes they use are the bomb. https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/ez-straw-grass-seed-germination-blanket-4-x-50-ft-200-sq-ft  Art

The point is that the Grass Boss gave me a grocery bag of seed. I don't know where you are Chris but you can have it. I asked what the combo is and John told me it would be like KFC giving out the secret chicken recipe. It's a mix of Fescue, Kentucky Blue Hybrid for our climates and a Bentgrass seed.

I redid at little section of my side yard. I have 4 plots, 2 different types of seeds, with burlap and without. Initial observations (lol)- I can see why it's best not to seed in summer, the strong sun can dry out the burlap pretty quickly. I'm guessing the burlap still retains more moisture in the soil because the soil isn't in direct sunlight. "

1030124,Headhunter,2018-06-21 19:43:00,5703,Keep the burlap on the grass until you see the blades of grass peaking through the burlap. Wait until you see lots of grass. Keep watering it every day so that the ground stays wet. You can cut it when you are ready. HH
1030128,BillM,2018-06-21 20:04:00,17367,"You wanna overseed in the fall, overseeding in the spring really isn't what you wanna do.    Fall seeding grass takes so much better.   We're talking October/November!"
1030130,chris.brock,2018-06-21 20:28:00,4053,"Too late, lol. I think I could have left it on for another couple days. I did see lots of grass poking through. The good thing is the coverage is good and uniform, not many sparse areas. I have seed and dirt leftover from the spring so I'm just playing around, trying to refine my techniques. I will over seed in the fall too Bill when it looks like we are going to have a stretch of rainy weather."

I've tried them all, CIL, Scotts etc. Tried different techniques with watering and top soil. Some germinate and some grass does grow but it's patchy and crappy looking. How do the guys that sell sod grow that thick, shag carpet like stuff? better chemicals that I can buy? I throw in a fish pic from last weekend for some fishing content, lol. "
1029557,Jmeyer,2018-06-11 01:44:00,83,"Sweet fish Chris, working in New development I've seen the struggle for great grass quick first hand and unfortunately the best results are sod laid in mid to late fall. Cooler wet conditions help it take root then the dormancy of winter makes for a great lawn. Spring is ok too but it's been so dry and its probably a bit late for seed or sod with good results"
1029559,bigugli,2018-06-11 03:32:00,6138,Seed soil fertilizer mix is something to apply in the earlier part of spring. later spring switch to sod or sod in the fall. Moisture retention and root development are everything. If you are laying sod on clay be sure to lay an inch of topsoil first.

1029561,craigdritchie,2018-06-11 12:03:00,1586,"Not much to it Chris. Lay down a solid coat of good grass seed, then cover it with an inch or so of topsoil mixed with some sort of fertilizer (bagged sheep manure from the garden center works great). Make sure you water it every day for at least three weeks. Ta-da! Nice thick grass. One more thing - the dirt needs some clay or peat moss mixed in to hold the water ... if its too sandy, the water just flows through and the grass will die. Nice speck by the way!  "
1029563,Headhunter,2018-06-11 12:34:00,5703,"In a white bucket, mix seed and top soil together. Put the mixture in the bare spots. Cover the mixture with burlap, tacking it down with pegs. Water it daily and do not allow anyone to trod upon it, until you see tiny blades of grass growing through the burlap. You can now remove the burlap and cut like any other part of the lawn. Most places on lawns that have dead spots are usually the result of two things. Grubs eating the roots of the grass or pet urine (females dogs) toxic to grass. If you suspect that dog pee is the culprit, you will need to dig out that section at least a foot below grade, fill it in with good top soil, they do the burlap trick. You will have green grass in under three weeks. HH"
1029571,Jds63,2018-06-11 14:07:00,1365,HH ... i'll have to try the burlap solution ... yep ... very true ... I've trained my dog to pee on a patch of rocks that i setup in the back yard ...when she peed on the grass it would die within a day ...
1029574,Headhunter,2018-06-11 14:28:00,5703,"Female dog urine is nasty stuff! I bet it would remove paint if it could! Yah, the burlap trick works great, just remember to mix the grass seed with top soil and it will be fine. HH"
1029578,GBW,2018-06-11 14:58:00,8460,Chris isn't a whit bucket sort of guy to me... My old dog Sierria I swear her pee made the grass grow 2x to the rest of the lawn for some reason!  But she never ate people food so maybe that could be why?

1029593,Tom S,2018-06-11 19:21:00,362,"I redid my entire back year a couple years ago. Killed everything, added in 10 yards of top soil, then seeded and watered. Used the Scotts coated seeds, worked fine. I followed the bag directions, but I feel I could have gone much heavier and had things fill in faster. My mistake was booking the first loads of the year (literally - the first loads) of topsoil from the supplier. It had sat all fall and early spring, and had plenty of weed seeds mixed in, which is now the new fight. Would have been better to wait a week or so until the top layer of soil from the pile had been sold to someone else, but I was anxious to get the job done."
1029595,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-11 19:28:00,8243,"Not rocket science Chris. I worked at a new Golf Course after I took my pension. The greenskeeper there could grow grass on a Bowling Ball. Look for a Bentgrass/Fescue mix. Or one or the other. If you can get some from a local Golf course is ideal. Best for our Southern Ont climate and that type of grass spreads like wildfire.  A few inches of good topsoil or triple mix. Spread the seeds on the topsoil by hand or a seed spreader depending on size of area and how small an opening you have on a spreader. Flip a tine rake over and use the smooth side to spread the seed. Water daily, when it looks to be muddy stop. Get your lawnmower ready. We did a pals 1/2 acre of seeded lawn around his new home. He was cutting grass in a month."
1029601,chris.brock,2018-06-11 21:18:00,4053,"The last few springs I pick up a yard of triple mix and work on the lawns. This year I started in early May and I am on my 3rd round of patching the patches, lol. I have tried mixing the seed and soil in a bucket. I haven't tried the burlap trick or the bentgrass/ fescue. I was guessing the depth the seeds are below the surface is critical but you guys are saying an inch of soil on top. "
1029604,craigdritchie,2018-06-12 00:39:00,1586,"That's about right, an inch or so is fine. you just have to be sure you water the hell out of it for a couple of weeks, so the seed doesn't dry out and that the roots go deep. Haven't tried the burlap trick but I expect that would work well,. Good idea."
1029607,smitty55,2018-06-12 03:36:00,928,"I use a similar strategy when I plant my basil, except I use white floating row cover. Soak the soil real good the first time then just wet the fabric daily. The soil stays moist and I get great germination and the seedlings have no prob lifting the light fabric.  Of course burlap is much heavier and will hold more moisture so it should work great as long as you don't let the grass get too long before lifting the tarp. If there's one absolute for me when it comes to grass seed success it's to make sure the soil never dries out, firstly to get even germination, but also depending on the amount of top dressing used, so you don't kill untold just sprouted seeds that could be close to the surface and dry out, as well as those sprouts deeper in the soil that  have to work harder to reach the surface. 	Good luck with it Chris."

1029651,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-12 20:01:00,8243,"I don't agree. The Sun has to get to the seed so why bury it. Burlap if you have a bird problem. You never see burlap on a Golf Course. Scarecrows, yes. And Big Ugly Bruce is bang on, early spring is best for seeding and fall is best for sodding. For the cost of a roll of sod I might consider living with it this summer and sod the thing this Fall. We in Canada and in the US are a few of the only nations that grow grass just to cut it. Most Europeans think we are nuts to spend all that time and money on lawn care. The water we waste to keep lawns plush and green is sinfull. I have never watered the lawn here in 22 years, ever. They cut grass by lighting it on fire in Italy. I'm surprised that peninsula hasn't sunk into the Sea with all that chamenta on the ground."
1029653,Lape0019,2018-06-12 20:13:00,647,"We have used the burlap trick in the past. Went so far as to make frames to cover in burlap. It gave the seeds some breathing room and the burlap held some moisture around a little longer. After a week, we had nice grass in that spot so we would move onto another. it took about a month or so to do the whole yard this way but the results were good."
1029656,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-12 21:57:00,8243,"OK I get it, burlap acts like mulch to hold moisture, not just for Birds eating the seeds. Give it a shot, better yet pave it. Chamenta doesn't need to be watered or mown."
