1029895,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-17 18:55:00,8243,"Did one once at the Bakery and picked it up. One of the guests was a Surgeon and who best to carve it. By the time he finished there wasn't a morsel of fat or skin on the table. We rescued the good parts and put it out it on the table. Fired him from carving the Porcetta, or anything from there on in. The Gen Xers in the Family won't touch anything like it. Not good for you, Grass and Kelp in a glass is though. Good more for me."
