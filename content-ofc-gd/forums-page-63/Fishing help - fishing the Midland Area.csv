I am hoping that someone could give me some suggestions as to where would be some good spots to fish and what I should be fishing for at this time of the year. Any and all help is greatly appreciated"
1029693,OhioFisherman,2018-06-13 15:09:00,6623,"To avoid any unpleasant experiences check your fishing regulations, I used to fish 3 states and Ontario, what is legal in one place may not be elsewhere."
1029694,AKRISONER,2018-06-13 15:49:00,5558,fish pike if you are fishing the bay...bass is still closed so put any that you catch back immediately and leave the spot.
1029708,aplumma,2018-06-13 19:53:00,6896,Feel free to give advise however if you are going to name spots keep them to P.M. please. Art
1029794,bobowski,2018-06-15 11:27:00,360,Be careful out there. Many rocks and shoals that are barely submerged with the water level being where its at. Look for healthy weeds in 10-15 fow adjacent to shallow bays and you should find some Pike. There's tons of pike in that area. Throw something big and flashy.
1029802,mikeh,2018-06-15 14:17:00,824,are you fishing from a boat or from shore?
1029880,Snidley,2018-06-17 15:08:00,620,"My sister lives on Midland Bay. When I'm there I fish the shoreline from my Hobie Floatcat rowboat. Consistently I look for onshore winds that stir up the shore and hit that shoreline with spinnerbaits, cranks and swimbaits. When it's calm I see other anglers fish/flip weedlines and holes in the weeds out further from shore from power boats using electronics I'm sure.Â  They are locals and they are there consistently so I'm sure they are getting fish. I get big Smallmouth and medium sized pike when I go out. Remember Midland Bay is rough, from wind but also from large boat traffic. On Thursday a woman drowned right in front of my sisters house when she got flipped out/off of her kayak. Her dog swam to shore but she washed up hours later. The bay gets REALLY rough so be carefull."
