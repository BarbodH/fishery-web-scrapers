1028866,Sterling,2018-05-28 12:53:00,477,"I plan on driving through some nasty overgrown roads in June and have been looking at some options for protecting paint. One option is a spray-on goop that is like rubber. It can be peeled off like, like that stuff women put on their face. There's also rolls of ""tape"", not pretty, but effective. I haven't found a product of this kind that I like. Does anyone here have experience with any such products and if so, which do you recommend?  Thanks"
1028868,AKRISONER,2018-05-28 13:16:00,5558,"for a cheap solution, id literally use painters tape...I used to painters tape my carbon fibre hood on my car when i was making trips up north...it worked really well! and it costs basically nothing. When done peel it off...it even holds up surprisingly well when it rains!"

1028958,mark demmery,2018-05-29 18:47:00,68,My buddies used to get that 3M clear film installed. Def more than painters tape...lol.  But it was good for a few years.

1028985,AKRISONER,2018-05-30 12:31:00,5558,if only we lived in a province where they didnt throw brine and salt on the roads because people cant friggin drive. 
1028991,Sterling,2018-05-30 14:09:00,477,"Wait - that thin painter's tape stuff? Wouldn't that take hours to cover a vehicle? Great product, awful website. Doesn't seem like they have popular models though like F150. Oh well - anyone want to partner up on a new business?"
1028993,AKRISONER,2018-05-30 14:43:00,5558,"You dont really need to cover the entire vehicle top to bottom do you? Even then, there is painters tape thats about 4 inches wide...it actually wouldnt take very long to do. I always did the front of the hood and then the bumper...it wasnt that bad. "
1028995,Sterling,2018-05-30 14:46:00,477,"I'd have to cover the entire sides of the vehicles, based on the amount of overgrowth I saw last time. Luckily we don't need to navigate this road this year, but it's always good to have a backup plan."
1028997,AKRISONER,2018-05-30 14:54:00,5558,with thicker width tape and 2 people...it wont take you very long at all...especially because it doesnt have to be precise at all.
1028998,Sterling,2018-05-30 14:57:00,477,Yeah it's not a bad option. 9 people tagging along... it would be done within 10 minutes.
