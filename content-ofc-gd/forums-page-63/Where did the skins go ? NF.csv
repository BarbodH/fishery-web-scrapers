1029865,woodenboater,2018-06-17 12:51:00,2277,"Site looks slightly different today, can't find the option to change skins. Just me or new look OFC ?  tia"
1029866,Terry,2018-06-17 12:59:00,14456,They just did an upgrade i would think they should return soon if they are compatible with the upgrade
1029870,Fisherman,2018-06-17 13:54:00,7201,Actually this is a better than the dark one.
1029873,npt1,2018-06-17 14:03:00,220,I like this one better also
1029876,BlueEye,2018-06-17 14:17:00,338,Happy Father's day guys.  I did an upgrade to the site this morning and also installed this as a new default skin on the site.  It should be much faster load times and easier to read than previous version.  I still got a couple things to do on it but just a quick notice as to what I am working behind the scenes here.  Glad to hear you guys like it so far ?
1029878,porkpie,2018-06-17 14:24:00,2521,Much better for mobile.  What would be even better is to get a mobile skin back.
1029883,ketchenany,2018-06-17 16:04:00,3229,"Yup,much better on the eyes."
1029886,misfish,2018-06-17 16:26:00,29133,"Yup, this old guy likes. I also seen alot of icons that can be used now. LMAO  ? Will come in handy Im sure ,when the 2019 hockey thread starts."
1029887,BlueEye,2018-06-17 16:30:00,338,Hahahah.... yeah part of the upgrade was a lot more icons/emojis (for better or worse I guess ?
1029893,misfish,2018-06-17 18:08:00,29133,"I for one love it. It,s INTERNATIONAL for, I LOVE YA. HA HA HA."
1029896,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-17 19:03:00,8243,"Blue, looks good. I presume the heart is a ""Like"" button? But now I can't send a PM, again. I finally was able to make my browser Google Chrome if that makes any difference. Thanks, Johnny D."
1029900,Fisherman,2018-06-17 19:47:00,7201,Check and see if you got my PM
1029904,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-17 20:35:00,8243,No PM.
1029905,Old Ironmaker,2018-06-17 20:37:00,8243,"Ok got it. I can't initiate one. When I select message nothing happens. If someone sends 1 I can reply, otherwise no go."
1029907,Fisherman,2018-06-17 21:10:00,7201,"Ok, I don't see a ""sent Items"" box either, maybe being worked on.  Rome wasn't built in a day and it takes me more than one day to eat a large pizza now."
1029913,cheaptackle,2018-06-17 23:50:00,849,Haven't tried any of the other features but I really like this look.  Reminds me of the older one.  Michael
1029914,smitty55,2018-06-18 00:01:00,928,Still missing the icon for last unread post on many of the threads. Tried it on chrome and same thing. Comes in handy on long threads with many pages.  Cheers
1029915,Dutch01,2018-06-18 03:57:00,1431,This! (Please!)
1029919,BlueEye,2018-06-18 12:42:00,338,"Good morning guys - Made a couple updates.  I'm not familiar with the icon you are talking about that takes you to the last unread comment but I think I figured out an equivalent solution. I've adjusted the board settings a little here:   	I've also noticed on the forum page itself, you will see the last page of the thread listed if there are mulitple pages: Hope this helps! Chad"
1029943,smitty55,2018-06-18 16:54:00,928,"Chad I'm referring to the dot or star that is just to the left of the thread title. Some have it , some don't. It was like that before as well. "
1029946,BlueEye,2018-06-18 17:12:00,338,Thanks for screen shot Smitty - very helpful.   It looks like you just have to be logged in and those dots or stars will appear there.  Here is what I'm seeing:   Clicking on those dots will take you to the first unread post.  The key I think is simply that you need to make sure you are logged in otherwise you won't ever see any dots. Thanks again - Chad
1029969,dave524,2018-06-18 20:39:00,4508,"When I am all caught up with a thread the dot goes away and the text of the name of the thread goes from bold to regular, could it just be you have read all the thread ? "
1029973,Fisherman,2018-06-18 21:35:00,7201,"Yes, same for me."
