1030086,rusmith,2018-06-21 12:37:00,1,Lived in Meaford for 13 years from 80 to 2003 In the early 90's we would go to here to fish Large mouth . 50 bass 2-6 lbs in and afternoon was not a problem . All released . Then about 94 Cronzy did a story on this lake in his Ontario fisherman rag. Went from 8 boats on lake on opener to hundreds with a line up a mile long to launch. Within 3 years no fish . And then other fish were showing up small mouth and pike which were never there . If you have a great spot keep it . It may not last. Very sad. I have a 6 lb Large mouth  mounted from this lake . And remember a friend catching one over 7 back in the day . Hope you had some luck
1029314,DJGeneral,2018-06-06 12:09:00,163,Hey guys just looking for any shore fishing spots on this lake ive heard about the public boat launch but its gets really busy with swimmers and boaters any help would be appreciated thanks
1029315,grimsbylander,2018-06-06 12:26:00,3016,The causeway would be best. Lot's of room down both sides and no issues with private property. It's about 1 km long. X marks the spot where I grew up.  Great place to spent summers back in the 70's  
1029325,DJGeneral,2018-06-06 13:38:00,163,Thanks a million! I heard it was really good back in 70's and 80's for fishing one more question where can i park? 
1029326,grimsbylander,2018-06-06 13:45:00,3016,I would think you could park along the causeway and fish 20' from your vehicle. I used to park my bicycle along there
1029327,DJGeneral,2018-06-06 13:46:00,163,LOL sounds good! thanks again
1029357,ketchenany,2018-06-06 17:20:00,3229,"No fish left, Grimsby landed them all. It was a big bike!"
1029359,misfish,2018-06-06 17:57:00,29133,"Back in the late 70,s and through out the 80,s, it was a big bass lake. Today, to much pressure and catch and keep. Not that I am against that. The laws the law. LOL"
1029360,grimsbylander,2018-06-06 18:00:00,3016,I had a bike trailer! haha
1029361,DJGeneral,2018-06-06 18:01:00,163, Do you guys suggest any other lakes in the area Ill be Staying in Markdale
1029362,DJGeneral,2018-06-06 18:01:00,163,lollll
1029364,grimsbylander,2018-06-06 18:04:00,3016,"Brian, when I lived there as a kid, I fished that lake every day in the summer and NEVER saw or caught a single largemouth....a million rock bass, yes. We all caught rainbow trout and brookies off the bridge on that causeway. It was later on in the 80's when the largies started showing up and yup, there were some pigs."
1029365,ketchenany,2018-06-06 18:51:00,3229,Lake Chapman's ice cream
1029366,DJGeneral,2018-06-06 19:08:00,163,nice one ketch lol
1029367,Fisherman,2018-06-06 19:15:00,7201,"Don't quote me but I'm pretty sure the last time I drove past there, there were NO Parking signs all along there."
1029368,DJGeneral,2018-06-06 19:20:00,163,Thanks for the heads up!
1029374,misfish,2018-06-06 20:34:00,29133,"I was introduced to the lake 79. We caught large mouth. Then they were not huge and yes, rainbows and brookies through the ice. The 80,s the bass were getting up in numbers and yes, some real pigs. Motor oil green 10"" worm. Yes, artificial back then byes. That back bay inlet Dave was the ticket."
1029375,grimsbylander,2018-06-06 20:49:00,3016,"Brian, did you ever go up to the traps? If you knew the lake, you may know the traps."
1029376,misfish,2018-06-06 20:55:00,29133,That must be a local thing . LOL Never heard of them. The last time I fished that lake was probly 10 years ago. Club tourny. There is this weed growth out there now that looks like huge umbrellas.  I  found the best bite was boiling spinner baits over the cabbage. Those bass would come out of no where.  The stump grounds is another great spot. You remember that rebel frog with the spinning back legs? KILLER. Probly how the buzz bait came about. LOL
1029391,grimsbylander,2018-06-07 02:56:00,3016,Lol stump fields! I remember when they were standing trees! You could cast from the bridge and get hung up in a 20' tree!
1029394,scuro2,2018-06-07 03:39:00,904,Isn't the water around the bridge 2-3 ft deep at best? Bring your topwater
1029395,Chuck Enwinde,2018-06-07 04:40:00,247,"Looks like you can park there, and fish there  https://www.google.com/maps/@44.3097289,-80.4864151,3a,59.8y,94.63h,88.07t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sDh1ClURzAjTUz9qpclhB7A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en Also all the fast moving streams in the area hold trout"
1029570,DJGeneral,2018-06-11 13:44:00,163,Thanks!!
1029649,Rattletrap2,2018-06-12 19:51:00,1652,Everything I have read says the Carp have really taken over and decimated the lake!
1030016,DJGeneral,2018-06-20 11:44:00,163,"Well Guys, I will be heading up there next week thursday for a week thanks for all the help tips, and tricks"
1030020,spinnerbaitking,2018-06-20 14:56:00,1622,Spinnerbaits are great but have some buzzbaits and spooks to throw early and late in the days. Tight Lines SBK
