282381,Patriot1,2008-12-21 17:33:00,8,"5 or 6 of my friends will be taking a fishing trip to Ontario in june probably.  Where should we go we are wanting good smallmouth, pike/muskie fishing?  Looking for a days drive from NE Ohio.  Not super expensive decent price, we are poor college age guys. Ive been looking at the French River, or Marten River.  But im looking for any other suggestions and where to stay.  Thanks for any help  Chris"
282383,Clampet,2008-12-21 17:36:00,1947,"Poor College age guys, huh? Pack a bag or two and head fer Algonquin Park. Fergit about marten River, nothing but skeeters. The French river, you can ill afford."
282387,Terry,2008-12-21 17:43:00,14456,you need to go at the very end of June  as that's when bass opens in many areas in ontario and muskie in the middle of june.........some areas do have bass open all year but check on the areas you want to go
282389,Grimace,2008-12-21 17:49:00,2020,If you have 5 or 6 guys the price on a cottage rental shouldn't sting too much once divided up.  The French could be done.  It puts you at an 8 or 9 hour drive which is not bad for a day of travel.
282399,Patriot1,2008-12-21 18:10:00,8,"Most of us are in college and a couple work.  So being in our early 20s we can't afford a fly-in trip or anything, we can probably afford to spend up to $600 a person.  Where is a good place to stay of the French river?  Which part of the river is best for fishing? Ive looked at the websites for Lunge lodge, and a couple in Wolseley Bay."
282400,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-21 18:12:00,2585,anywhere along georgian bay holds great fishing and if your camping you can save a ton of coin!  cheers!
282435,Grimace,2008-12-21 19:43:00,2020,"The French River Delta is pretty great.   Look for Bear's Den Lodge, they will come pick you up at Hartley's Bay and boat you in. It is about a five minute ride.  Walleye, Pike, Small Mouth Bass, and some monster Musky.  I liked it there, There is a lot of other places on the French as well I just mentioned that one because I believe the fishing is better on the Delta side and I have been to Bear's Den.  http://www.bearsdenlodge.com/  This is a really good resource as well http://www.ontariooutfittersnetwork.com/  as well as this http://www.getnorth.ca/   Good Luck."
282439,TJQ,2008-12-21 19:55:00,7806, Grimace is the man!!
282441,Grimace,2008-12-21 19:57:00,2020,I love the one with the map.   zooming into areas checking out lodges and dreaming of fishing trips.   I have fished every single one of those places in my mind.  lol
282446,Twocoda,2008-12-21 20:03:00,4130,Any where along Lake Huron is great fo fishing in June ...you can target bass/walleye in the larger rivers but if your boat is capable of handleing lake huron ....youll find fantastic salmon rainbow and lake trout fishing....Although there are cottages and bed and breakies scattered all up the coast  ( sarnia to tobermory)...camping is the way to go....Kincardine has a salmon derby on at the end of may beginning of june ..with great structure under the water meaning you dont hav to travel very far out on the lake to catch them ...( big bonus ...you can EAT everything!!!!) .....if your target time is end of june ...then i would say for jumbo perch ( huge yellow) port bruce on lake erie would be perfect for making your trip a lifetime memory....  Hope it helps and welcome to OFC
282459,pike slayer,2008-12-21 20:38:00,1177,"i say drive up through michigan to sault ste. marie and head north east towards the chapleau or wawa area. alot better fishing then south east. there are resorts in some areas but the best fishing is going ad bringing a tent or camper and parking at a lake for free. you guys just have to pay for gas, food, and booze. i know of lots of spots if interested pm me."
282461,watertight,2008-12-21 20:47:00,50,"Lake St. Claire has the species you're looking for You could call Bass Haven (519)354-4242 for info on bait,tackle, accomodations,etc. Hope this helps."
283024,Patriot1,2008-12-23 00:53:00,8,"thanks for all the replies so far, any other ideas would be helpful  Looking for smallmouths primarily.  Thanks Chris"
283027,BassAsin,2008-12-23 00:59:00,806,"if smallies are the primary marten river is a good choice, i have caught many there before as well lake nipissing is another good choice for smallies"
283055,brw,2008-12-23 02:06:00,101,Chris: Check out www.georgianbayfishing.com. Is 500 mi from NE Ohio --8.5 hr drive or less if you're closer to cleveland. it's a fishing camp 18 mi out in Georgian Bay about 10 min by boat from the mouth of the French. Lots of good smallie action and the camp is affordable by Ontario lodging standards. Might just be the right fit for you. Contact me privately if you want more information.
283128,bassman,2008-12-23 05:38:00,384,"West Nipissing Resort http://www.westnipissingresort.com/  I've gone up the last couple of years with 6-7 guys ans stayed at their Chalets. Great Pike fishing right off of the dock, but you can also rent a boat and go for smallies, muskie and walleye. Ian's also a great host.  Bryer's Lodge http://www.bryerlodge.com/  They're in Wolseley Bay on the French River. Same species as Nipissing.  Good Luck!"
283158,solopaddler,2008-12-23 10:19:00,8605,I'll second Georgian Bay fishing camp. Beautiful area and trophy fish of all species.  Beyond that you mentioned your budget was $600 each? You're definitely able to afford a fly in for that kind of coin. That's what I'd be looking at....
