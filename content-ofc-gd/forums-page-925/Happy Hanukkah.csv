Toronto man eats three kilos of latkes to win unusual New York contest By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Sunday, December 21, 2008   LAKE GROVE, New York - That’s a lot of latkes.  A 23-year-old mechanical engineering student downed 46 of the potato pancakes in eight minutes to win a contest at a Long Island deli.  Pete Czerwinski says he’d never eaten a latke before consuming about three kilos of them Sunday at Zan’s in Lake Grove.  The Toronto bodybuilder says he’s just ""a power eater"" whose brain never signals that he’s full.  Association of Independent Competitive Eaters Chairman Arnie Chapman says Czerwinski demolished the contest’s previous record of 31 latkes, set in 2006.  The pancakes are a traditional treat for Hanukkah, the eight-day Jewish Festival of Lights. It started Sunday evening."
