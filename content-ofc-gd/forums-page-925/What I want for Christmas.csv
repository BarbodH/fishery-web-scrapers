282212,jwl,2008-12-21 03:50:00,1056,you probably have to be pretty careful with that one.... if you fall asleep on the couch watching tv and you lose the remote down the cushions and roll over on it you never know what button you might hit  but..better than I got last year... piece of tail and a sweater......both where a bit too loose
282213,hammercarp,2008-12-21 04:05:00,964,Listen. Women and cats will do as they please and men and dogs might as well get used to it.

282232,qaz,2008-12-21 05:18:00,26,"My wife is happy to confuse that she married a ""bear shirter"" and says "" I'll can control him,, but pull the lease too tight and you'll get turned on'   She lets me have free run so to speak, but has no fear that I will go a stray.    Hey don't know for sure she means but she don't try to stop me from behind me.  She tells me she doesn't what me to change..she like me the way I am."
282260,Rich Clemens,2008-12-21 11:18:00,3131,I'm sure they make one of these for the ladies .... quite a bit larger with more buttons I hear.
282265,Big Cliff,2008-12-21 11:42:00,6899," True story: Many years ago when I was much younger and not quite so wise; I and a few friends were sitting in my den having a beer just after Christmas and someone asked me what I had gotten for Christmas. My words were very similar but what I didn't realize was that Sue had just come in behind me. She just smiled and said ""well I got about the same thing but mine were all about two sizes too small""! Needless to say the guys all thought it was REALLY funny and I haven't used that line since! LOL."
282273,Fisherman,2008-12-21 12:29:00,7201,"Where's the ""Make Butt smaller"" button?"
282274,musky_man,2008-12-21 12:33:00,159,What makes you think some ladies would not be happy with this gift too
282279,hammercarp,2008-12-21 13:15:00,964,Ah my friend there is defeatism and then there realism. I prefer to think of myself as a realist. Also that quote I used is a lot older than I am.
282310,douG,2008-12-21 14:59:00,2693,Many years ago my buddies chipped in and got me a sweater for my birthday.  I really wanted a moaner tho.
