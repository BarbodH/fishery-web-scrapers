283116,niagarafisher,2008-12-23 04:59:00,2,I've been up there 4 times in the last 2 years and most recently in late october only because my parents own a cottage on that chain of lakes.  The fishing there is tough to say the least.  We have caught a couple walleye (2) a few small pike and some smallies.  I tried once trolling for lake trout and managed 4 of them all around 1-2 pounds fishing in about 85-90 fow.  I heard it is supposed to be better ice fishing but have never triied it yet.  There are many back lakes only accessible by atv or snowmobile that have way better fishing.  I would recommend the lodge as they are very well kept and super nice people who run it.  All their boats and motors are new and always get repeat customers every year which speaks for itself. Niagarafisher
