282474,BassAsin,2008-12-21 21:22:00,806,never tried them myself but did see the IN-FISHERMAN using the other day looked like a handy rig!
282501,bassjnkie,2008-12-21 22:07:00,1101,"I made one a couple years ago (I did post it here), and attached a small siren. When to rod sets the hook the siren sounds. Has adjustable pin, so you can use different rod strengths. It works great, but never tried it on the ice. I'm not into ice fishing that much.  EDIT: Mine is only good for ice rods."
282524,Leecher,2008-12-21 22:51:00,7832,Never seen this setup before.... very interesting and cool idea Thanks for sharing pike slayer Leechman
282609,drwxr,2008-12-22 00:51:00,453,saw this some time ago   
282626,pike slayer,2008-12-22 01:30:00,1177,hey thanks for the pics efka. now the release of the rod is the ring falls off the eyelet when the rod moves down when the fish starts to run correct? then the board falls and the flag goes up right?
282649,drwxr,2008-12-22 01:56:00,453,"in pic#3 you can see that the line is loose, but when fish strikes its creates tension and the line moves the ring away from the eyelet and the rod pops up, and yes the the board falls and the flag goes up."
282658,Fisherman,2008-12-22 02:07:00,7201,Here's a couple more versions: www.iceshanty.com/ice_fishing/index.php?topic=92011.0  and www.iceshanty.com/ice_fishing/index.php?topic=16435.0    same sort of idea.
282709,Spinpin,2008-12-22 03:44:00,12,here is another rig.  http://www.automaticicefisherman.com/
282717,danc,2008-12-22 04:09:00,4677,"Personally I'd rather set the hook myself. There's nothing like feeling the bite with freezing bare hands and deciding when to set the hook. Having a machine do this for me would take away most, if not all of the fun if ice fishing."
282973,pike slayer,2008-12-22 22:58:00,1177,"i totally agree with you DanC but you cant be 2 places at once, jigging one rod in your hand and the other still line rigged with one of these slammer would be ideal in my mind!"
