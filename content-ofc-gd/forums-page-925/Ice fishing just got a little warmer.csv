282403,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-21 18:21:00,2585,awesome set up!  Cheers!
280978,limeyangler,2008-12-18 00:34:00,5204,"I took it out today for the first time, WOW....what a difference. It was -25 celcius when we arrived....although nice and sunny. But the difference between outside and inside was like two different universes, really noticed the difference...and we didn't even have a heater!!! And being mostly black it really soaked up the sun too.   This is not a sled for towing by hand though...holy crappolla is it heavy!!! My snowmachine is in for a service so me and my buddy pulled it out by hand...ok going DOWN to the lake....but coming UP was a real chore....i'm a little worried now as to whether even my snowmachine will manange...time will tell.   What i really loved was how easy it was to deploy and take down....litteraly 30seconds, just whip the elasticated cover off, all your gear is easy to get to and it just pulls up and clicks into place as you go.....so Run 'N'Gun style fishing will be a breeze!!!   NO PROBLEM GETTING DOWN TO THE LAKE....BUT ITS A HEAVY BEAST...DEFINITELY A SNOWMOBILE OR ATV NEEDED.         THE BLACK MATERIAL REALLY SOAKED UP THE SUN'S HEAT, LOL ...AND DAVE IS ALSO 6'4"" AND 250lbs....SO MAKES IT LOOK SMALL!!!         PLENTY OF ROOM INSIDE, AND WINDOWS ALL ROUND                It kinda sucked that we only caught small perch today.....but that lake is normally pretty good"
281027,Fisherman,2008-12-18 02:16:00,7201,"They are definitely nice huts, went to BPro this evening to get the mid sized one, all sold out except for the floor model, supposed to have a few more coming in the next while.  The bench seat is a little higher than some of the other swivel seat models, feels better on the back for me."
281058,buddyphil,2008-12-18 03:32:00,9,"nice hut!! i noticed a fish finder in one of your pics.....i dont think i recognize it ....it looks pretty good ,what make is that and where might i find it?  phil"
281066,limeyangler,2008-12-18 04:43:00,5204,"   Hey Phil,   The fishfinder is the Lowrance  X67C. An awesome little bit o gear....i use it on my boat in the summer too. You can buy it as an Ice fishing pack...but i just bought a battery and ""iceducer seperately and save over $100. I just took the mounting bracket off the boat.....attached it to a short pice of wood siding i had lying about...and put it in an old soft sided cooler. It has a LCD flasher mode too if flashers are your prefered fishfinder...and despite what some peple say the screen does not freeze in minus temps......it was outside the hut today as temps started dropping below -25 C.    Heres a clip of it in graph mode i made a few weeks back...great fun.    <embed width=""448"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://i263.photobucket.com/player.swf?file=http://vid263.photobucket.com/albums/ii158/vishuscirquel/MVI_2316.flv"">     AND I SHOULD BE GETTING PAID BY LOWRANCE AND OTTER TEAM WILD!!!!!"

281245,ciceri,2008-12-18 21:54:00,535,"what do these range from? i 'd like a 2 man one, and i have a snowmobile so i could pull it with that."
281338,Fisherman,2008-12-19 01:12:00,7201,"$399+tax at BPro when the are in stock, I'm waiting for more to come. Comes with the seat and travel cover."
282335,profisher25,2008-12-21 16:19:00,185,"This sled is amazing, im definitely going to have to try and get one myself, where did you buy it?"
