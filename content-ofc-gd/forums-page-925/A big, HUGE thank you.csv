I am going to try and send out PM's to each person involved and ...it may take me awhile to get to everyone! I am touched and humbled by it all. A special thanks to those who mailed me and sent me support outside of the auction. Your timing was perfect and I am forever grateful. I was at the specialists office Thursday and he had a good news/bad news combo for me. The good news is that the growth is not cancerous. The bad news is that the growth is not operable because of my previous cancer (orchiectomy) so we need to try and get rid of it with drugs. So I am on a neuro blocker for pain which really helps but really knocks me on my butt. I am sleeping through the night now though Actually sleeping about 12 hours a day now! But I can now stand up for about an hour finally. I have had this for about a year now and am glad to finally have some sort of treatment plan...I just wish I had not put it off for so long. Just figured if I ignored it, it would go away...it's a guy thing. For the technically or medically minded I have 2 spermatoceles and a hydrocele. None have increased in size over the last month however they have caused a condition called orchalgia. It is not life threatening, however, is..well, lets says very uncomfortable and leave it at that. I am on these meds for six weeks then back for re-assessment. If there is no change they will attempt to treat it with a more aggressive drugs. In the mean time I am resting and trying to get my weight back up to normal...lots of cookies should do the trick. Beer would help, but not allowed alcohol for now   THANK YOU EVERYONE!!!   "
