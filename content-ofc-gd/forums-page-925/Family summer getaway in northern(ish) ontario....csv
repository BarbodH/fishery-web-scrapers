276817,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-07 21:24:00,2050,"Hey guys,  Twice a summer my wife, daughter and I make the 6-7 hour drive up to my parents place in Hanmer, ON for long weekends - and it always seems so rushed.  You spend friday in the car, you're there all day saturday, usually running around visiting and such, then you leave sunday afternoon and make the long drive back.  It's never relaxing and we don't get to spend nearly enough ""quality"" time with my parents.  This spring we're slated to have another little one, so making the drive will become even tougher with two kids in the truck.  SO, my wife and I have decided that we're going to start a family tradition, that is to spend 1 week at a cabin somewhere up north with my parent's and who ever else wants to come out and visit during the week.  It has to be close enough to Sudbury that my extended family can come out for a day or two if they'd like.  I grew up fishing the west arm - my grandmother had a trailer @ victoria park off of musky bay road.  So right now I'm leaning towards that area, but if anybody has any suggestions I'm open for ideas.  I need a place to keep my boat docked for the week, and the more private of a cabin we can get the better!  Obviously fishing is important to me as well, my primary targets being Walleye, Pike and Smallies.  Panfish for the kids would be nice to.  Thanks a bunch for any leads.  Cheers, Ryan"

276834,crappieperchhunter,2008-12-07 22:40:00,2582,"Camp Horizon in Field. Stopped going 5 years ago when we bought our own cottage or we would still be going. Not the ritz...but clean comfortable and very reasonable. Nice shallow sandy beach for the little ones with a floating dock out deeper for the swimmers.  Fishing is very good for eyes, pike both sm & lm bass and muskies too. Even 10-12 inch perch 100 yards off the swimming area along the 12 foot weed line. Nice small sheltered lake. Absolutely loved it there. Denny and Ruth are good people. Always have a pot of coffee on at the lodge and Ruth makes the best maple walnut donuts I have ever had, along with other goodies.  It is very popular and many people come every year so book ASAP if anything is still available. When we went we had to book for the next summer while we where there, so good luck with getting in, but the place is great.  My family went 7 years in a row. My brothers family has been going for 12 years I think.  Pm me if you have anymore questions.  Regards, Steve"
276872,solopaddler,2008-12-08 00:19:00,8605,Hmmm..if it was me I'd look for a private rental. This is just one of many similar websites:  http://www.cottagelink.com/rentals.shtml
276918,Radnine,2008-12-08 01:49:00,1538,Solopaddler has the right idea with an Internet cottage search site. I have found two places on that site (in particular) and both have worked out fantastically. Plus it is just plain fun to see what's out there and to set goals. Good luck and great idea on the family vacation/tradition. Jim
276921,The Urban Fisherman,2008-12-08 01:57:00,2050,Thanks guys I appreciate all the input.  I'm actually putting a few hours in the office tonight and surfing all these sites while I wait for the computer to do it's thing every once in a while.... If anybody else has ideas don't be shy to toss them my way!  Cheers OFC
