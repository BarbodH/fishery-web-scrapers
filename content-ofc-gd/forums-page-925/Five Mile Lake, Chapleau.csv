277115,MZEHRING,2008-12-08 18:02:00,5,Has anyone ever fished Five Mile Lake Lodge near Chapleau? Thinking about going there next June and was looking for any advice as to how good the fishing is there. Any information would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!
277148,Chrispy,2008-12-08 19:57:00,168,If you are going to Five Mile Lake Lodge you will have a great time....I met Dave and Christine last spring and they are very nice people!!!  The fishing was a lot better than the lake that I was on about 10 miles down the road.....get in touch with Dave and he will let you know how the fishing was last spring.....   Chrispy!
277184,pike slayer,2008-12-08 22:17:00,1177,"i have personally not fished it but i have a book that describes the lake and it says ""Five Mile Lake-is the centrepiece of Five Mile Porvinical Park. This large lake offers a fun day of fishing for walleye, northern pike, sallmouth bass, and lake whitefish."" alot of those lakes are decent in that area. there is a trophy pike lake south of five mile close to burntwood but its some rough country getting there and is a trophy lake for a reason"
277219,MZEHRING,2008-12-08 23:30:00,5,"Chrispy, Did you actually fish it? Or did you just visit? I was curious as to how good the Smallmouth were in that lake?"
277317,dustink,2008-12-09 02:19:00,526,"Dave & Christine are great people and they run a good camp.  4 of us guys were there in '04 (U.S. Memorial day week) & '05 (July 4th week).  We camped one year and stayed in a cabin the other.  Good walleye...lots of pike but no real size....and, yes, smallies.  Caught a few pushing 5# on top water near the old ramp in the closed provincial park.  PM me if you need some more / detailed info....I think I have a marked map I could track down for you.  dk"
