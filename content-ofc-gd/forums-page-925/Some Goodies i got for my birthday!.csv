282455,MCTFisher9120,2008-12-21 20:28:00,3761,"I have a feeling about those goby's and minnow's. I think there going to work well, and the reviews on BPS are pretty good for all of those baits. I can't wait to go to BPS and spend some $$ on new Rapala baits"
282458,Rizzo,2008-12-21 20:36:00,4754,I used to use them but we have a bajillion pike in our lake and they tear 'em apart (ie bite the tail off and there goes the action)

282679,tibbs,2008-12-22 02:44:00,650,Happy B-Day!
282694,limeyangler,2008-12-22 03:01:00,5204,Happy birthday bro  fishermen are sooooooo easy to buy gifts for.....lol
282696,BassAsin,2008-12-22 03:03:00,806,thats right you can never have enough tackle rods reels etc   even though fishermen only use 40% of their tackle 10% of the time
282732,qaz,2008-12-22 06:06:00,26,"  I can second the good feelings about the goby's they are showing up in the stomachs of lots of fish, from Walleye to some of the trout and Salmon. They seem also be favorite of Bass..   Enjoy..the ""gifts""."
282922,GBW,2008-12-22 20:18:00,8460,I like the one's that are close to the live minnow you have there.  I have them in perch and walleye and catch walleye chucking those in the evening.  Most of those swimming baits that have the treble hook as well I like.  Happy belated as well...
282984,modny,2008-12-22 23:11:00,502,all aboard the rock and roll train  happy birthday sonny jim
