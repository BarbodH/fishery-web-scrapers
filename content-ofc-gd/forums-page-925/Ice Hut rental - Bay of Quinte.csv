282798,Steel28,2008-12-22 14:12:00,160,Dave is a good operator Clamp-It. His huts are nice and specious and always on fish. I think his prices (what you have posted) are great.
282803,Guest gbfisher,2008-12-22 14:35:00,0,"I guess you don't fish much with a complaint like that!! Better yet. Buy your own machine, your own hut, spend the time putting it out, blocking it up, chopping the holes open, buyin the bait and last but not least,,, bringin it back in and blocking it up for next season. 140 is cheap. Its no wonder they dont charge more. I know that Perch fishing on Simcoe in a hut can cost 40 per person, easy!  If you like to ice fish, its the price ya have to pay. Take yer pick..."
282807,Steel28,2008-12-22 14:38:00,160,Agree with GB 100%  Hey GB   See you on Kemp Bay soon.
282812,forrest,2008-12-22 15:13:00,1032, Did you find that shelter blowing across the lake?
282814,danbo,2008-12-22 15:28:00,2646,"Man, that's the Ritz compared to mine..  "
282895,forrest,2008-12-22 18:59:00,1032," Like I have not heard that lame one a few hundred times   If I wanted to I could say that sentence,but, there is no way I could make my face that ugly.  You can have the phrase and keep the face.  forrest"

282355,Woodsman,2008-12-21 16:42:00,1286,More than I would pay.
282357,Terry,2008-12-21 16:43:00,14456,"most on simcoe seem to be about 45 to 65 per person per day, so if you have 3 people not tooooooo bad I guess    but I think a buck a day is about the right amount to charge......LOL"
282359,irishfield,2008-12-21 16:46:00,26272,At least I know what to charge Terry now... plus lodging of course !
282366,Riparian,2008-12-21 17:04:00,269,Id say thats pretty steep
282405,BUSTER,2008-12-21 18:24:00,1336,"yip thats steep for me,  i paid 85 for a hut ,me and 2 kids ride out and back free bait ,propane heater,stove,lights also."
282423,camillj,2008-12-21 19:08:00,1988,Wow .. and I thought I paid alot fr my portable ($200) ... heh .. use it twice and Im ahead of the game.
282437,Beans,2008-12-21 19:48:00,3339,"Seems steep to me...  I believe Big Cliff was quoted $170 per person for the rental of an ice bungalow on Nippissing (meals not included)  You had the hut from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon, transportation and bait included...  A cheap motel is probably $35 a night per person and renting a hut for two days at Quinte @ $170 plus the cost of bait makes Nipissing's $170 look inviting..."
282465,Clampet,2008-12-21 20:59:00,1947,"Then there's this here model with dog fer $100.00, called the ""Beans"" special.. "
282497,forrest,2008-12-21 22:00:00,1032,"$170!  Wow!  Are they 20 x 20 with running water, big screen tv and a bar?"
282506,fishindevil,2008-12-21 22:18:00,6254,"Hey clampit, [emailÂ protected]  on the bay of quinte will rent a hut,and a cabin for $80 dollars per day !!!!and i think that includes bait,too!!!!... that price you have is way to high,ya just have to shop around,the guys mentioned above have been in the game along time and will get you into fish,check them out....cheers"
282514,lunkerbasshunter,2008-12-21 22:28:00,2585,"yeah 170 is very hgh, althoguh not sure if that is the going rate on quinte or not, but north of t.o they are way cheaper  Cheers!"
282521,Clampet,2008-12-21 22:44:00,1947,       
282523,fishboy,2008-12-21 22:48:00,550,yikes...is there a pole in that hut (& not meaning a fishing pole)...
282540,sandybay,2008-12-21 23:13:00,64,"Up here on Nipissing daily hut rentals go for $45.00 to 60.00 person, holes drilled and some include a dozen minnows per person."
282542,irishfield,2008-12-21 23:15:00,26272,    Okay Paul... is it $170 or $140 ?? and this is for 4 people.. =  only $35 each!
282546,mbac31,2008-12-21 23:23:00,904,Thats actually one hell of a deal. $35 bucks each with ride and all extras. You will be hard pressed to fin d cheaper.
282569,camillj,2008-12-21 23:49:00,1988,Yep ... better get the story straight ... thats completely different ..... like 400% different ...
282588,BUSTER,2008-12-22 00:14:00,1336,"35 each? nothing wrong with that, i may even take that offer!"
282671,richyb,2008-12-22 02:31:00,774,my hut is a 7x8 and has plenty of room for 4 guys
282675,irishfield,2008-12-22 02:38:00,26272, Nope.. not even in my drunk'n University days Paul! LMAO. College gals in the hottub... maybe....
282678,richyb,2008-12-22 02:43:00,774,They may be 10 but they are big buggers and atleast i have friends !!!!
282708,richyb,2008-12-22 03:43:00,774,Public ? who goes out in public ? .. and i guess your right 6x10 is way too small for 4 fellers wanting to have a pillow fight on their weekend pass from the loony bin      (  only joking its all in fun )
282710,Sugarpacket,2008-12-22 03:51:00,82,"Last time I rented one it was $35 per person, bait/ride included.. that was like 3 years back and not on Quinte of course.  Damn Sugarpacket being logged in. this post was by Rich (TM 2008)"
282738,waterwolf,2008-12-22 07:43:00,556,"10 x 6,, should be lots of room for 4 .ample room for stow . you're  not sleepin' in there .i'm sure there are outside lines to tend to for a good % of the time . $35 a head 's not bad at all.  been in tighter spaces and caught fish. it might be a bit small when the cheerleaders show up."
