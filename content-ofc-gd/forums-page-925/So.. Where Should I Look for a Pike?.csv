Goes to 16ft with deep weeds as well. Nailed hammerhandles all over the place but big ones usually evade me.  Where's a good starting point for a big pike through first ice?  Just makin' conversation.. too excited to sleep!"
282332,Leecher,2008-12-21 16:00:00,7832,"Rich, I'd start on the drop off and work your way to the shallows.... usually drop offs will hold bait fish, good starting point IMO  Good luck to ya Leechman"
282370,Riparian,2008-12-21 17:09:00,269,Try really large deadbaits hooked with a quickstrike under a tip up.
282741,waterwolf,2008-12-22 08:15:00,556,"find the deeper weed-beds with transition to shallows close by . stay flexible ,, cut your holes in various depths early and be prepared to move if certain holes don't produce.   on a shallow water-body stealth is essential ,, cut early , move quietly . i prefer SMALL portugese sardines dead-stickin' than any other ,,,. good luck."
