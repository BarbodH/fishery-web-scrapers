What did you catch? and what bait,Lure,Tackle did you use? sorry for all the questions but I have lived here for 27 years and have never tried fishing on the big Lake.  Any info that anyone has would be great, I am looking forward to the start of the softwater season. Thanks"

283060,Hubbard,2008-12-23 02:19:00,22,huh I guess nobody fishs Lake Huron well thanks for trying I guess.  Looks like I'll just have to go out and figure it out myself come summer.

I was working in Goderich this summer but I did not get to fish it at all.  Kincardine I heard was the best summer spot for salmon.  I also heard there was some smallies kicking around the rock piles down by St Joseph ( about 7 miles or so south of Bayfield).   But again I do not know first hand as I did not fish it.  There are a bunch of steelhead out in the lake somewhere as well.  I saw a pile of Carp in the Bayfield River by the boat launch if your into that sort of thing"
