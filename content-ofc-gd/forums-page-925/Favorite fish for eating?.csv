Sometimes I will make a sauce with lemon and dill and cover with it after the turn, about 5 minutes before serving.  Or, a dollop of mango curry sauce - great on salmon.

Of all the trout, small brookies are my favorite, fried whole in butter.  Of local freshwater I'll take pike over walleye and whitefish, BBQ'd on the plank.... with garlic butter.  Of all salmon I like Atlantic, again, cooked on the plank.... maybe with a little apple-curry, or maple salsa garnish.  For chowder if I can get arctic char that's the bomb.  Most flavourful.  Of southern Ontario fish I'll take perch over anything... except maybe crappie which I can't remember tasting but know I have.  Battered and deep fried with a good squeeze of lemon.  Louisianna or blackened catfish... droooooool!!!  LoneStar used to sell it with shrimp, was a favorite but not enough people ordered it so it got canned.  A shame.  Tried many ocean fish but I'd have to say halibut is number 1, followed closely by grouper and mahi mahi.  Red snapper and fresh yellowfin are pretty darned good also.   A favorite... impossible,"
