282735,waterwolf,2008-12-22 06:46:00,556,"probably a great idea ,  much easier on the ear drums ,,  more eco friendly and faster cutting . the catch must be the cost, no??"
282747,Grimace,2008-12-22 10:54:00,2020,"Looks neat.   The reverse thing is a bit silly, it wouldn't clean the hole but just throw all the crap back down the flights into the hole."
282960,johnnyb,2008-12-22 22:14:00,3413,"From what I've seen on predominantly U.S. boards, these things might really take off -- cost seems to be in and aroudn the $300 mark...if you were looking to buy your first auger, or already had a hand auger and wanted to go power, it seems to be a pretty good option"
282969,pike slayer,2008-12-22 22:46:00,1177,"i think that is such an awesome idea and that you can put it on a hand auger wow!! im in love! only thing i worry is if those batteries can actually hold up to the cold, my hand auger can handle the abuse of a motor. the only thing keeping me from buying one is the cost. im gonna put this in my favourites and it will be on the top of my wanted list for ice fishing next year. thanks alot danbo, your making me spend money!!"
283016,lookinforwalleye,2008-12-23 00:21:00,4399,"Looks like a cool gadget I wonder how it would handle 20"" of -20 hard ice.  The thing that bothers me and it`s not only this product but many many others out there is the 1 year warranty imho it does not say much about the faith they have in their products. Ice fishing season is around 3 months long around here and if you use it 2 or 3 times that`s less than 10 uses and if it dies after half a dozen uses your on your own."
283017,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-23 00:28:00,10439,"They have been getting very good reviews from those that own them on Ice Shanty. It's not for me though as they don't support 10"" drills and I don't know how many holes I could drill through 4 feet of ice!!"
283018,pike slayer,2008-12-23 00:37:00,1177,"20"" of ice? try close to 4feet and what that thing can handle! also good point with having a one year warrenty! i fish from december into april and go almost every weekend and do trips for a couple days at a time. i would give it the real test!"
