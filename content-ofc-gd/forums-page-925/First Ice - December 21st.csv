282464,Rich,2008-12-21 20:57:00,3927,"Headed out on the ice for the first (well second but first time with fishing rods) time today after long debate of whether or not to go out. Safe ice was not the issue, we tested in Thursday night and found 3 - 4 inches in most areas under some gray crap ice. However, there were 50kph winds forecasted today which we were not looking forward to. Ended up saying let's get out there anyway and off Sugarpacket, our friend Mark and I went in hopes of pike & panfish.  Hit the pond and were just blasted with wind immediately. We stuck it out in this spot for about a half hour and finally decided we'd look for some shelter on the other side of the pond.  Packed up and headed to the other side, drilled a test hole.. it was a bit thinner here but still safe close in. Dropped our lines and I rigged up the sonar which I just put fresh batteries in this morning. Flipped it on and... it showed 574 feet of water. WOW I never thought this pond was that deep. LOL But that's okay, the fish were sitting about 360 feet down. Obviously the finder is finally pooched after 12 years of abuse. After a couple minutes it gave no reading at all. The transducer is finally worn out.  Anywho, we fished blindly and got into a few panfish. Bites were few and far between, especially for Mark who never landed a fish today. He was happy to get out though.  Had a great time on the ice despite the brutal weather, looking forward to a (hopefully) long ice season!    "
