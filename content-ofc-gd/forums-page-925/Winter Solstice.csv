282254,Roy,2008-12-21 10:06:00,13728,"Good morning everyone! I know that Lew won't like to hear this but today is only the first day of winter. Today is the shortest day of the year....night being the longest DOHHHH. If you have something to do needing daylight, get crackin'. You only have eight and a half hours to do it in.  Have a great day everyone."
282255,motv8tr,2008-12-21 10:23:00,2587,"Well if this is the shortest day of the year, that means from here on in, the days get longer and spring is just around the corner  Maureen"
282257,Golfisher,2008-12-21 10:34:00,586,It can only get better from now on.
282258,Big Cliff,2008-12-21 10:34:00,6899,Spring won't get here quick enough for me! I'm tired of winter already and it just got here!
282259,Rich Clemens,2008-12-21 11:15:00,3131,Bring on the longer days.

282290,HTHM,2008-12-21 14:23:00,4082,It seems to happen every year around this time..... I guess it is an uphill battle from now on.
282346,Fisherman,2008-12-21 16:31:00,7201,"And here my teacher has been wrong all this time, he said all days are the same, just daylight hours change.   Hot water heater anyone.."

282519,Jigger,2008-12-21 22:40:00,1237,"Summers comin'!!! A little ice fishing to pass the time and then ice out lakers, then pike, then musky, and before you know it, bass opener!!! WOO-HOO!!!!"
282529,Bernie,2008-12-21 22:55:00,3190, Very interesting douG. 500 years before the great pyramids.............. That's before Roy was born.
282567,forrest,2008-12-21 23:46:00,1032,I like the solstice more than xmas and new years......the latter 2 are copycats of the original.
282628,Greencoachdog,2008-12-22 01:33:00,8163,... just that much closer to the Spring Equinox!!!
282630,danc,2008-12-22 01:39:00,4677, What did your biggest Spring Equinox weigh Dog?
282722,douG,2008-12-22 04:45:00,2693,"Bernie, that's exactly what I thought, 500 years before the Egyptians started to make their pyramids, the bloody Irish made a theatre that was lit up once a year by the sun, to celebrate the end of teh darkness.  The structure was built out of rocks.  That sounds as though they had some time on their hands, plenty o meat and hides, the kids were doing well at school and the retirement fund was coming along nicely.  That was a full thousand years before Stonehenge was built, too.  That accuracy of planning and design could exist 5000 (FIVE THOUSAND) years ago boggles this here mind.  Especially in Ireland.  I can say this really slow, one more time, for the Irish."
282729,danc,2008-12-22 05:41:00,4677, Thanks Douglas. I'll read this thread again tomorrow and try to figger it out.
282774,Greencoachdog,2008-12-22 13:04:00,8163, 6 3/4 lbs. (with a 2 oz. bottom bouncer stuffed up his butt!)    Very hard fighting fish and nearly impossible to land!!!  I had to fight this one for 10 days before I could tire him out enough to land him!!!
