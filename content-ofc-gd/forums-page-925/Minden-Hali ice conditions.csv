280796,NAC,2008-12-17 14:43:00,369,Just looking to see if anyone has any updates for that area?  Bancroft would be nice to hear from as well. I'll be up for a couple days over the holiday on Kashagawigamog.  Thanks.
280806,mikegta,2008-12-17 15:22:00,39,"yes an ice report from this area would be great as a bunch of us will also be fishing the area over the new years(kash lake, hali lake and eagle) and any more that might be suggested   thanks mike"
280810,Steel28,2008-12-17 15:28:00,160,Interested in conditions as well. Also if anyone ice fished Lake Benoir in Bancroft and can provide any tips (not spots) would be great. Will be up there from Dec.31st - Jan.5th. Thanks.
280845,NAC,2008-12-17 17:56:00,369,Just got off the phone with Kashaga Ken and he reports plenty of ice for fishing and that there has been sleds out on the lake all week.
281089,singingdog,2008-12-18 10:56:00,1047,"I would definitly be careful. Ice conditions this year are strange. Head lake - right in Haliburton - has had ice for over a month, with sleds on it daily. Kennisis lake and Horseshoe lake both had lots of open water right up until a week ago. We definitly lost ice during that last thaw, with open water showing up anywhere there is current."
282408,fishboy,2008-12-21 18:38:00,550,Glad to hear there's ice in Kashag...any other updates folks (please)-plan to head up in the next week near Carnavon.
