281104,Mike the Pike,2008-12-18 13:07:00,3421, 9lbs 9oz walleye Bay of Quinte.   9lbs 8oz Bay of Quinte.   PB large mouth this summer 3lbs.  Did not catch my first Muskie or Lake Trout there is always next year.  MTP
281108,John,2008-12-18 13:18:00,2956,"Didn't do well at all myself. Maybe had something to do with the fact that I spent way too much time working and not near enough time on the water.  The highlight of the year was taking my grandson Brent up to Lakair for his first ever fishing experience. He is now ""hooked"" and can't wait for next year....    "
281337,Toddyc20,2008-12-19 01:10:00,141,  My PB largemouth.    PB smallmouth    My first ever muskie.  Not the biggest fish in the lake but sure was exciting.
282340,profisher25,2008-12-21 16:26:00,185,"WOW, it seems that everyone has had a great year of fishing!  Well I congratulate you all, and wish you luck in the new year! Happy Fishin'"
280976,Big Cliff,2008-12-18 00:27:00,6899,"Well, I had many ""Catches of the year"".  Crappie fishing last winter with Beans on lake X. A wonderful time with a very special friend.  Our trip to Simco with Sly, Big Chev4X4, Tybo, and the beautiful Lady Walley and Joey, the catching wasn't the best but the company.... Well who could ask for more?  Spring fishing with photoz and CPH, man you guys sure made my day and Sue just hauled the last package of rainbow out of the freezer so I hope you are ready for next spring.  Crappie fishing with Meeley, Tony, Nanook, and Beans, your genorisity overwhelms me Tony, thank you again for the wonderful feed of slabs!  The wonderful OFNr's that came to help me with my dock this spring, What can I ever do to show you all how much I appreciate all your help? What was even more wonderful was that many of you were able to come back and brightened a weekend for Sue, Andy, and I this past summer. Each and every one of you is welcome here anytime you care to venture this way!  So Many wonderful catches of the year but I defy anone to up stage this one! This was my catch of the year and she captured my heart! What better catch could an old man ever hope to get than a hug from a princess!  How could anything so tiny make such a huge impression?      If I could have but one wish for next year it would be that each and everyone of you get such a hug from someone that means so much to you. Give and you will get!"

280996,mistyriver1,2008-12-18 01:14:00,600,"I'll never forget 2008, definitely a great year for me .  Two fifty inchers  The first one on Lac Seul in July ....     The second one in August on Lake Nipissing with Lew.....  "
280998,BassAsin,2008-12-18 01:19:00,806,"it sure was, my biggest to date for sure many in the 3-4 lb range but never over a 5 had no scale but have seen enough specks over 5 to know by now.my fathers largest speck is 5lb 10 oz and his buddy on that occasion caught a 6lb 10oz monster and i rounded out the bottom with 2 that weighed 3 14 a male and a female"
281091,qaz,2008-12-18 11:55:00,26,I got this one the end of November a little before the Lake Erie shore froze up now at the mill creek in Kingsville.     I caught her with a big worm and some bling...   
280285,Leecher,2008-12-16 17:31:00,7832,"For me, nothing big but plenty of them... and the ones that stands out are the following:  Hard water - 18"" Walleye    Pike - No measurements on that one    13"" Crappie    17"" SMB    Softwater - 5Lbs Channel Cat    4Lbs+ LMB    27"" Pike    Leechman"
280345,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-16 19:47:00,1362,"I didn't get out as much as I wanted this year but when I did, I managed to have some great outings....  Here's my PB Laker caught towards the end of July...    And here's the biggest Muskie of the season...close to my PB but not quite!!    And the most memorable fish and outing was when I was able to get Whitespinnerbait (Paul) into his first Muskie  "
280353,JohnF,2008-12-16 20:13:00,3494,"A great big beautiful smallmouth I caught on the Thames one morning with no witnesses, no camera and no way to properly measure it as I was standing in water up to my bellybutton. It's likely no one will ever believe me but I got the memory all the same. It was an exciting fish to catch.  JF"
280365,profisher25,2008-12-16 20:36:00,185,"I think my highlight of the year was my very first muskie. I unfortunately didn't do as much fishing as expected this year, but the muskie was a real treat for me. I think though that 09 is going to be my best fishing year for me, and i plan on hitting some new lakes, catching some new fish, and land that big trophy as well. those are my main goals for 09 fishing."
280366,silvio,2008-12-16 20:36:00,433,Couple of really spunky fall steelhead that I will never forget. Lost some really big ones this year hopefully all get them next year.      And also this beautiful coho a fight I will never forget.  
280367,snag,2008-12-16 20:36:00,1932," I believe you  Everyones been in that position.  I'll bet that if you had a camera and witnesses it may not have been caught. Just happens like that sometimes.  It was meant for private viewing, that's all."
280371,Cookslav,2008-12-16 20:39:00,1457,"I had a S-L-O-W year Not much time on the water between Moving early in the year, watching the 2 kids, and the birth of My Son in July....Ya I was swamped LOL!
