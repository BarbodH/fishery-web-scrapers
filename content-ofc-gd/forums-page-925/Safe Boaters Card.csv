282612,forrest,2008-12-22 00:57:00,1032,  There is an exception for rentals.
282615,brifishrgy,2008-12-22 01:10:00,559,"  I believe there is only an exception for guides (its their job and not ""recreation"" ... but I could be wrong)"
282617,jwl,2008-12-22 01:14:00,1056," I know people who have went on fishing trips over the last couple years and a liscence was required by the outfitters before they could rent a boat.  I myself have mine, have been in boats since I could walk, grew up running all different sized boats, way back over 20 years ago a marina on LSC when I was a teenager, my grandma had a cottage and I would rent a boat from the local marina,,,way back then, they didn't care about safety gear ect..the guy atthe marina would point me to the boat, hand me a lifejacket and say...""it's a Merc, if you have trouble starting it, goof around with the choke""   , and off I went.  Growing up as a somewhat experienced boater, I thought it was a little lame when they came out with the boater's cards that you could go online...fail, then write it again 2 seconds later with the answers in another window and pass as many people have gotten away with over the last few years."
282620,irishfield,2008-12-22 01:19:00,26272,"Rental agreement is still valid in lieu of a boaters card.. and why I have them at the camp for my ""guests"" to fill out to use a boat. One advantage of ""shell"" corporations I guess. lol"
282623,Greencoachdog,2008-12-22 01:25:00,8163,"We've only had them for aboot 10 yrs. now down here in 'Bama... it's printed on the back of our drivers license, so if you drove to the lake... you have your boating license with you!"
282785,Woodsman,2008-12-22 13:35:00,1286,"If I don't pass the test, can I try again?  The test can be written as often as required, although it is strongly recommended that a course be taken if you are unsuccessful the first time. The test can be written only once in every 24-hour period.  This was cut & pasted from the Transport Canada site. http://www.tc.gc.ca/marinesafety/debs/obs/...eratorfaq.htm#v Not saying how well it's enforced. Also other good info at the site.  Best Wishes: Rick"
283141,POLLIWOGG,2008-12-23 06:11:00,835,"There is a new set of rules for administering the test that make it harder to do at shows, you can't do it at your home or online other than a class setting. whoever is giving the test must have a set of the rules etc.  A lot of the new rules are being ignored same as the old ones.  The card is  a cash cow given to private organizations because no gov. org. wanted to do it, if they did it would be costing us a lot more in the form of a renewable license.  The hope that it would be a gateway to more advanced courses didn't pan out and attendance to advanced  courses actually dropped as people figured thats all they need.  The commercial boaters card is far more advanced than the PCOC and should be up and running by now but I haven't heard too much about it. This is what the guides and anyone working on a boat would need."
282576,camillj,2008-12-22 00:01:00,1988,Got mine a few years agos at the sportsman show .... but yes .. studying online is a good idea ... I was actually surprised how many types of marker bouys I had never come across ... most of the stuff should be intuitive to  a seasoned boater ... but some things I truly never knew ... and could have been a problem had I been boating in unfamilair waters ... anyhow .. I say ... get it and be done with it.
282607,Silo Buster,2008-12-22 00:48:00,81,"I wrote mine online and passed.I just read thru the book (brush up my  bouys).  When I did mine online,the site wanted me to have someone with a license watching for no cheating.They wanted that persons card #also.     What are the lodges going to do that rent boats out?,expect everyone to have a lic?"
282611,brifishrgy,2008-12-22 00:54:00,559,  Yup
