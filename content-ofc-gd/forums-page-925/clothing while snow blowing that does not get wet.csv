282646,irishfield,2008-12-22 01:51:00,26272,This is a fishing forum.. so I'll give you a fishing answer. Wear your floater suit  !
282647,Fisherman,2008-12-22 01:53:00,7201,"How about your Gortex rainsuit, after all it's water in another state."
282651,NANUK,2008-12-22 01:57:00,797,"Depending how cold it is, mostly I just wear my snowmobile bibs, any waterproof/replant jacket, a toque and gloves, you don't want to sweat while out in the cold"
282653,Rizzo,2008-12-22 02:02:00,4754,I pretty much turn and run when the wind shifts (and here I thought the guys with the cover were sissies)
282661,Greencoachdog,2008-12-22 02:10:00,8163,I like a nice pair of blue jeans and a cottin twill baseball cap.. shirt is optional!
282664,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-22 02:23:00,10439,Snowmobile suit or one of these:  http://woodstock.kijiji.ca/c-buy-and-sell-...QQAdIdZ71077753  
282666,Leecher,2008-12-22 02:23:00,7832,"Lloyd,  when there's wind I don't even go out... I just wait until it dies down.  Usually after sun down the winds diminish and I say usually, not always the case  My old hunting jacket, pair of insulated rubber boots with my beaver skin hat and mittens is what I use all the time for snowblowing the snow  Leechman"

282761,Spiel,2008-12-22 12:27:00,9065,"  Yeah, what Wayne said. Neighbours laugh at first but I stayed dry and they didn't. Don't over dress underneath one though."
282924,Canuck2fan,2008-12-22 20:27:00,1444,If you don't want to spend the dollars on a floater suit. Wait until Wally world has their clearance sale on the remington parkas and pants. Totally waterproof/windproof and you can use them for fishing in the cold. I have been out in rain/sleet storms for hours in mine and never had the moisture come through. In snow been out all day with it snowing real heavy same thing. The best part though is that the outside of it is like cotton so it doesn't get stiff and therefore restrict your ability to move...
282925,douG,2008-12-22 20:29:00,2693,"What Raf said, Goretex can't be beat."
282935,TJQ,2008-12-22 20:49:00,7806,I wear my floater suit...  very nice...
