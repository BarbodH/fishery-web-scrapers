282174,ciceri,2008-12-21 02:55:00,535,"i dont know if you guys have seen the sale on the 2 berkly ice rods at CT this week, but i picked it up. Came with a light action and a box of 4lbs micro ice, and the second rod is heavier and came with 6lbs to spool on to it.  Im wondering what i should use for a leader on the 6lbs, and how do you connect them and how long?  thanks"
282179,BassAsin,2008-12-21 03:05:00,806,i would likely bumb that 6 up to a deccent 10-20 braid same diameter so no line loss on the spool and you never know when you may latch into a monster that wants to run as for the leader i always use the thinest diameter leaders that are a 5lb test higher than the line i use and make sure they have a good swivel at the top if your gonna jig a spoon!
282181,ciceri,2008-12-21 03:09:00,535,"i was thinking of getting fireline crystal ice, but you only get like 50 yards or something, lol.  what else is out there for braided ice line?"
282182,Leecher,2008-12-21 03:11:00,7832,"You may want to use fluro leaders, 12"" long and use a uni to uni knot to connect them together. Leechman"
282184,BassAsin,2008-12-21 03:11:00,806,personally i use spiderwire XXX its the stuff in the yellow box very supple even in the cold and takes a good beating! 110yds to a spool the 20 lb is an 8 lb diameter i believe and the 10 lb is a 2 lbs diameter i believe i would try the 20 and i think its even on at CT for 15$ a spool right now a good price for braid!
282185,ciceri,2008-12-21 03:12:00,535,"do you buy them individually, or buy a spool and cut pieces off?"
282186,BassAsin,2008-12-21 03:13:00,806,used to love the fluro leader uni-uni until i got bit off one day and go steel all the way now! personal opinion though 1 out of a few hundred isnt bad though! who knows i may end up with problems with a steel leader yet!
282187,BassAsin,2008-12-21 03:14:00,806,i use steel leaders not fluro anymore but individual
282188,ciceri,2008-12-21 03:14:00,535," okay, sounds like a plan.  what do you guys do for attaching lures? i got one of those jigging rapalas and some jigs today, do i just straight tie, or can i use a small swivel so i can switch up?"
282190,BassAsin,2008-12-21 03:16:00,806,"i use a mustad 12"" steel leader so it has a good swivle at the top and an easy to change slasp on the bottom"
282194,Leecher,2008-12-21 03:28:00,7832, All depends on what species is being targetted.... if pike is the targetted specie then I would go with steel leaders and would change that 6Lbs mono for some 20Lbs PP braid.  all other species I'd go with fluro leaders uni to uni.  Jacques
282198,BassAsin,2008-12-21 03:33:00,806,good call jaques that is for when i'm fishing pike!!!! forgot to mention that!
282206,ciceri,2008-12-21 03:40:00,535,"thanks fellas, i'll see what i can find. I bought some little pink tube jig things today, so if i go fishing tomorrow i'll just jig those and see if i can get some perch or something."
