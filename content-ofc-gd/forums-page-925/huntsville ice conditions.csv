There was a good 3-4 inches of clear ice, covered by another 8 inches of slush which had frozen firm enough to walk on without breaking through...the auger pretty much fell through it though. Depending on the lake you're looking at, it could be dicey by the 27th.  Wherever you go, don't go alone, or without safety gear!  And like irishfield says, lots more snow....it's already waist deep!"
