278608,jeffw,2008-12-12 13:38:00,267,"I'm heading out on sun to do some icefishing and was wondering if anyone knew what the ice was like on North pigeon, little wren, and grindstone lake. Thanks Jeff"
278617,Jer,2008-12-12 13:57:00,1426,"I don't know those lakes in particular, but I was up that way (Minden, Carnarvon) yesterday.  They've got so much snow, I can't believe any ice would be any good."
278621,Steel28,2008-12-12 14:06:00,160,"Hey Jeff,  I'm going to check a few small lakes in Minden tomorrow morning.  Got my gear ready, spud bar and will let you know conditions."
278735,jeffw,2008-12-12 19:07:00,267,thanks I appreciate it. I will also post how I do

278989,singingdog,2008-12-13 11:26:00,1047,"It's very lake-specific right now. Smaller lakes may be good to go, but larger lakes still have lots of open water on them."
279388,Steel28,2008-12-14 14:18:00,160,"A bit late but..  North Pigeon has 3 inches slushed ice - no go.  Fished Cedar lake, about 4 inches."
279974,jeffw,2008-12-15 21:35:00,267,I found the same results on those two lakes. North pigeon is all black ice and hopefully the rain got rid of all the snow.

282829,Nemo,2008-12-22 16:05:00,727,Anyone with info on Kashag? Just wondering how the ice is and if there is any oopen ice left?  Nemo
