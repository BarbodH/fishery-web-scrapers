1062326,grimsbylander,2020-05-25 22:05:00,3016,Replaced all hooks. 	Red treble up front.  	Feathered treble with red thread on tail.  	Added extra split rings on trebles.  	Added line snap on nose.
1062327,David Chong,2020-05-25 22:08:00,836,"Nice job, although the middle hook is standard! The hooks that come on today's Yo-Zuri lures are top-notch, in fact the rear hook is the one that came with it, I just added some feathers!"
1062328,misfish,2020-05-25 22:09:00,29133,Yup Yup Yup and  Yup
1062329,grimsbylander,2020-05-25 22:11:00,3016,Interesting. I’ve only seen silver trebles on Yo Zuri’s. Nice!
1062330,grimsbylander,2020-05-25 22:12:00,3016,I think I won the old treble hooks he took off 😂
1062331,misfish,2020-05-25 22:17:00,29133,"Think I will start tying up trebles and sell them to David.  Maybe he can win some, if he can tell me the feathers and thread type used. HAHAHAHAHA"
1062334,David Chong,2020-05-25 23:46:00,836,Most of the 3DB & 3DS lures now have top quality black nickel hooks on them!
1062335,grimsbylander,2020-05-25 23:54:00,3016,That’s great actually. It’s always bugged me when hardbody bait companies put so much into their baits only to outfit them with substandard hooks. I particular Canadian company comes to mind. 😉
1062341,AKRISONER,2020-05-26 02:19:00,5558,"Even worse, a particular “high end” bass lure company based out of Japan that likes to charge north of $30 a lure has some of the worst hooks in the entire industry on their baits...nothing mega about the quality of their hooks at all. my favourite experience was the time a fish bent a hook out and the lure came flying out of its face right into my hand past the barb."
