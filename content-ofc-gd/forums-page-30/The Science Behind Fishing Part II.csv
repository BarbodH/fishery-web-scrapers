April 28th at 7:30 PM on the ""EVERYTHING You Wanted to Know About FISHING but were afraid 2 ask..."" group page https://www.facebook.com/groups/1421921441322251/ as I will be talking with Dr. Bruce Tufts, Professor of Fisheries & Conservation from Queen's University in Kingston! Dr. Tufts is one of the foremost experts on Smallmouth Bass behaviour, populations and biology in the world. He is also the person behind the practices of the Shimano Live Release System that most tournaments' live release are based on. Most recently, he helped put forward a proposal to create a ""Early Season Catch & Release Season"" in FMZ 20 along with a delayed opener for Smallies out there! Please join us and bring your questions and we'll try to answer as many as possible.  "
