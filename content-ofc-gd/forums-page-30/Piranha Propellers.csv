1061580,John Bacon,2020-05-09 22:40:00,3277,Has anyone tried a Piranha Prop?  Is their performance noticebly different than aluminum props.  	I am planning to switch to a four blade prop.  I remember seeing these at the Sportsman Show and was wondering how they perform.
1061583,Woodsman,2020-05-10 00:58:00,1286,Are they the replaceable blade props? 
1061584,John Bacon,2020-05-10 01:32:00,3277,Yes.  https://piranha.com/

1061809,lickmyarmpit,2020-05-14 18:22:00,359,I have one on the boat now 90hp merc. I fish alot of uncharted northern waters and it's saved me multiple times now.  Being able to lift the motor to swap out a broken blade is way more important to me than a bit of performance.  I guess it depends on how you use your rig.  I would definitely recommend if you are looking for durability and not performance.
1061821,Woodsman,2020-05-14 19:56:00,1286,lickmyarmpit I thought the blade flexibility would decrease performance but have not owned one so I didn't comment on that. 
1061881,John Bacon,2020-05-15 18:21:00,3277,Flexibility may actually improve the hole shot because the flexing effectively reduces pitch.  But you may lose some top end speed for the same reason.
1061907,lickmyarmpit,2020-05-16 01:12:00,359,Exactly she sits down on plane allot quicker but has lost a few mph wide open.  I run a deep wide Lund so going stupid fast was never really an option. Way too much drag for the 90.
