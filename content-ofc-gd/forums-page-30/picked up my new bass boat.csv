1061786,bow slayer,2020-05-14 11:07:00,1074,might be underpowered fast forward to 4:10 to see it in action https://m.youtube.com/c/cbmedia404
1061791,AKRISONER,2020-05-14 12:02:00,5558,lmao holy crap. Interesting they are using a turbo diesel for power. I guess they are probably grabbing small truck engines. When I heard 60psi I was thinking What the literal hell? Then I realized it was a turbo diesel lol. I wanna know who was the first guy to figure out you can go that fast on one of those hulls. Holy crap it seems scary and dangerous as all hell...probably because it is lol. Absolutely wild.
1061812,Bill,2020-05-14 18:54:00,140,Incredible. Not a ride I would take.
1061813,grimsbylander,2020-05-14 18:58:00,3016,Heck I would!! The real question is...where are they getting the loot to build $20k USD boats??? Lol
1061814,misfish,2020-05-14 19:01:00,29133,Just you tube these boats. There are many that have tweeked them out.
1061815,BillM,2020-05-14 19:07:00,17367,This is awesome.
1061818,aplumma,2020-05-14 19:45:00,6896,here is a little more of the backyard builds racing Art
1061839,dave524,2020-05-15 10:56:00,4508,"Reminds me of the popular sea fleas that were built from Mechanics Illustrated Plans around 1960, we didn't tweak the motors though"
1061862,mamona,2020-05-15 15:37:00,597,"OMG, they are flying. It looks like they have auto kill switch as well."
1061867,Freshtrax,2020-05-15 15:50:00,2215,With a job..just like you or I would?Â  Â Thailand has a fairly booming economy.   All I know is I want one for hauling duck decoys.
1061870,grimsbylander,2020-05-15 16:11:00,3016,"Sounds simple enough. Lol The average wage in Thailand is around $800CDN per month. So regardless of their economy, I didnâ€™t expect to see $20k USD boats."
1061871,dave524,2020-05-15 16:39:00,4508,"go for it, there is a few around Long Point.Â https://www.kijiji.ca/v-powerboat-motorboat/ottawa/last-one-sold-mud-motor-long-tail-motor-kit/1424311401"

1062310,dave524,2020-05-25 13:40:00,4508,"early 60's here, cable and pulley steering, the throttle you just reached back and twisted the tiller, one speed, flat outÂ ðŸ˜€"
1062332,DRIFTER_016,2020-05-25 23:35:00,10439,Those Thai's really do make bad a$$ surface drive rigs.
1062333,grimsbylander,2020-05-25 23:39:00,3016,How did we ever manage withoutÂ writing a test and gettingÂ a Pleasure craft licence??
1062338,dave524,2020-05-26 00:15:00,4508,"Still in elementary, probably 12 or 13, can you even get a license that young ?"
1062339,grimsbylander,2020-05-26 00:22:00,3016,"You can now, yes."
1062354,Rattletrap2,2020-05-26 13:22:00,1652,"My worst fear would be capsizing in that water! I don't imagine it is none too clean? If you survived the impact of the crash, probably come out without your finger and toe nails!"
