1061754,Terry,2020-05-13 19:03:00,14456,"Very cool i didn’t have time to watch it all right now   Will finish tonight but I love the way once they commit, they’re all in on the attack and it sure shows why strong leaders are needed"
1061768,OhioFisherman,2020-05-13 21:21:00,6623,Great shots of the bite!
1061769,David Chong,2020-05-13 21:22:00,836,Vicious strikes! Love how aggressive they can be at times and how timid at others!
1061771,PUMP KNOWS,2020-05-13 22:28:00,937,"In this video the baits were on a slow retrieve, they have more time to follow and analyze the bait.  When the baits are on a faster retrieve, they’re attacks are vicious. Thanks, I hope to capture some more after covid.  Do you still rep Mend-it?  I need that stuff for these swimbaits.  I can’t find that stuff anywhere in the GTA."
1061781,David Chong,2020-05-14 03:05:00,836,I do! Where do you usually shop at? They all have access to it!
1061799,PUMP KNOWS,2020-05-14 16:01:00,937,I just called JB Fishing Depot and the guy said they’re sold out.  He’s not sure if he’ll order anymore because of covid. Al Flahertys is another shop but I don’t think they carry it. I also shop at Sail but I’ve never seen them there. 
1061801,David Chong,2020-05-14 16:13:00,836,JB’s can definitely order them in! Let me see what I can do!

1062069,PUMP KNOWS,2020-05-20 02:59:00,937,"Awesome!  Thanks! Yes, I also use a gofish cam"
