1061230,Rizzo,2020-05-03 00:41:00,4754,almost musky spawning temps!
1061234,AKRISONER,2020-05-03 01:33:00,5558,Careful with Ernie! didnt know Limber tail was a thing until I saw my buddies dog get it in the spring. It was clearly very uncomfortable for the dog and took a few days to go away!
1061251,KraTToR,2020-05-03 17:22:00,506,"BOQ yesterday, 51 deg inner bay, 48 deg out on the reach. Fishing totally sucked, only heard of 4 'eyes being caught.Â  There were a fair amount of boats out as a lot of waterfront properties have their own launch.Â  OPP stopped us 2x, once in Hay Bay, 2nd time in the reach. "
1061269,BillM,2020-05-03 21:04:00,17367,My Yami F115 loves those cold water temps.Â  Best mileage of the season.

1062286,Rizzo,2020-05-25 00:04:00,4754,"we were swimming in the lake Friday, was pretty comfortable actually (even I had to go in to deal with a dock issue). Having said that, our lake is only 7-10 feet in most spots. Saw tons of bass in the shallows gettin busy...love this time of year!"
1062312,AKRISONER,2020-05-25 14:27:00,5558,"thats what i heard, huge schools of fish over the weekend on the tri lakes all in <4fow. love is in the air! or the water lol I dealt with my dock issues 2 weeks ago...wasnt so fun lol We have a dry suit thank god, but after 10 hours of diving down 8 feet to hook into chains in 40 something degree water I was over it lol"
