1062117,kickingfrog,2020-05-21 17:49:00,8333,Pike and eyes with maybe some pan fish to keep my daughter happy.
1062214,kickingfrog,2020-05-23 22:55:00,8333,Felt like an early summer day but with spring water temperatures. Nice to get out of the house and run the boat. Not much happened while casting and the kids find trolling too boring so we didn’t do much but my daughter was the one who landed the lone fish dragging lures. She was very proud to supply us with lunch today.
