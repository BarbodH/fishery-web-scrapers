The guide we had was doing his Masters on the Walleye population and habits in the lake. We were tagging all the Walleye that we released. We went back to the same spot 3 times over the week we were there and we caught several of the same Walleye 2 or 3 times. If we caught a tagged fish, the guide would record the tag number and he was surprised how many times we were catching the same fish."
