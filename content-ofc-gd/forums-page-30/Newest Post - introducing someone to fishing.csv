They absolutely love fishing when I take them, I just wish I could push them over that edge that makes them interested enough to start buying gear and really take it on."
1062209,gordy28,2020-05-23 19:17:00,638,Thanks!   That's funny. One of my cousins would only use a spin cast and did the flip over for the longest time. For sure.  Well maybe this summer w limited opportunities for adventure tips them over to the dark side! I definitely think the fact that we were on the cusp of driving played a role.  Fishing and camping was a new reason to drive lol.  Also helped that my parents had the trailer and the boat on Balsam.   Thanks for the read.
