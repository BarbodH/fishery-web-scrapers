1062033,Old Ironmaker,2020-05-19 10:50:00,8243,"CHCH TV announced that part of phase 1 of getting back to normal The Ontario Provincial Gov is allowing boat ramps to open. Now what? I can only go fishing with someone living at the same address as me. The last statement is mine and mine alone. Otherwise I won't be following social distancing guidelines, no?"
1062040,mamona,2020-05-19 14:47:00,597,I am wondering if there will be anyone enforcing the law at a boat launch.
1062042,irishfield,2020-05-19 14:56:00,26272,"Transport Canada's boating RECOMMENDATION is to only boat with members of your own household. That said it's not law and fishing in a 14' or larger boat and staying at your own ends =Â  more than 6' of seperation. To follow the social distancing rules under the emergency act, take separate vehicles to the launch, one guy puts the boat in and the other jumps in the nose. Doable and I have at least twoÂ buddiesÂ doing so since this all started."
1062055,misfish,2020-05-19 19:12:00,29133,Barrie marina to open Friday.
1062143,Old Ironmaker,2020-05-22 04:50:00,8243,"Does anyone know if the Port Maitland pier is open. Also the ramp there, is it opened? Our friend Huzzaba was asking me."
1062164,Terry,2020-05-22 18:43:00,14456,More open ramps  
1062165,misfish,2020-05-22 18:47:00,29133,2 toon launches open today. Let the fun begin. And stay the $%@$ away from me. ðŸ–•ðŸ˜‚
1062176,LefroyFisherman,2020-05-22 23:22:00,602,"Little patheticÂ trying to book a launch at Innisfil Beach, I tried a couple days ago and the closest I could find an open slot was like 4 days away at like 7pm, nothing in the morning ish for like a week. They are booking them in 30 minute intervals, so not very many per day. I'm very put off fishing in the boat right now... I have to be able to predict the weather a week in advance to be able to take my kid out fishing. We've just fished for perch in the local rivers around us."
1062179,Terry,2020-05-23 00:29:00,14456,Yup I ended up booking everyday next week. Just so I can get out on the nice days
1062183,Old Ironmaker,2020-05-23 02:56:00,8243,"For what it's worth. I'm told that 2 buddy's went out yesterday fishing on Erie. When they got back to the ramp an OPP ghost car and 2 constables are waiting for them. They told the Cops that they live together under the same roof. ID says either one guy isÂ  lying or one guy hasn't changed his address. No fine, just a warning. My question is it a fineable offence?"
1062203,Terry,2020-05-23 17:29:00,14456,"When non residents can launch at Innisfil beach park it just got much more expensive The cost to park at Innisfil Beach Park just went up. On May 13, Innisfil council approved the increase. Innisfil residents with valid parking passes can continue to park for free, but non-residents will have to fork out $10 per hour, up to a daily maximum of $50. Buses will have to pay $50, plus $10 for each person on-board, except for children under 10, who are free. Story continues below The fee to use the boat launch is also increasing to $25 per launch. In 2019, it cost $7 an hour up to a maximum of $45 to park at Innisfil Beach Park, and $20 to launch a boat. The 2019 price of $7 an hour for parking still applies at other town-operated lots within one kilometre of the Lake Simcoe shoreline in 2020. According to town staff, in 2019, parking revenue at Innisfil Beach Park was $332,433, and parking revenue at Shore Acres Drive and Guest Road was $32,717, for a total of $365,150. The fine for a parking infraction remains $75 for voluntary payment and $90 for a set fine."
