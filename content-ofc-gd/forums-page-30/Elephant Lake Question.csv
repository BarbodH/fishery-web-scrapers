Thanks for your help."
1061628,John Bacon,2020-05-11 13:10:00,3277,"It's a shallow weedy lake.  There are not too many rocks, but lots of stumps in many areas."
1061629,Simmer,2020-05-11 13:14:00,2,Is there decent areas for boating and tubing things with the kids or if they fall off will they be right in the weeds?
1061633,Ronzo,2020-05-11 14:36:00,124,"I haven't been on Elephant in years, but I remember it as pretty shallow and weedy, and very stumpy. If you use the Ontario GIS mapping software, you can click 'Map Layers', un-check Assessment Parcel, and if you scroll over to Elephant, it shows it as being weedy pretty well all over. https://www.gisapplication.lrc.gov.on.ca/matm/Index.html?site=Make_A_Topographic_Map&viewer=MATM&locale=en-US "

1061650,TheoSteel,2020-05-11 20:39:00,4,Spent most my time on Baptiste over the years . But also went to Elephant every time I was at Baptiste . It used to be one of the best lakes for Bass till the Pike took over . Lots of water between the 3 lakes . Not to populated as far as cottages . But yes Elephant is weedy and so is Baptiste when you get closer to shore in a lot of spots . Pike fishing is good and there are some nice ones around . There is a lot of wood under the water so be careful . Nice body of water for something without a large cottage population that is within a reasonable driving distance . Hope it works out for you

All three lakes are excellent for fishing with Elephant being the shallowest & weediest of all three. Baptiste is deep in areas and is more of a Shield lake as is Benoir! Great chain of lake to be on, stay in the markers while navigating between Elephant & Baptiste, lots of stumps off the channel!"
