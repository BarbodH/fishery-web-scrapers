1061581,Fisherman,2020-05-09 22:58:00,7201,Well I guess I'll have to leave at midnight now. 
1061582,Terry,2020-05-09 23:28:00,14456,"Well with Muskoka open.  	Kawartha lakes opening on the 14 kingston open Belleville, Picton  open north Frontenac and more ramps open. shouldn’t be too bad provincial parks opening for day pass. Their boat ramps are day pass accessible so I hope they are open"
1061626,dave524,2020-05-11 12:59:00,4508,"We have only flattened the curve here in Niagara, the numbers are not going down yet, what are these idiots thinking by opening things up so soon , going to end up losing the whole summer if it backfires  edit: just speaking as part of the most vulnerable segment of society"
1061627,SirCranksalot,2020-05-11 13:06:00,3291,They never did close it.!!! Maybe you can express the same sentiment to the town---contact info on-line 
1061630,Terry,2020-05-11 13:45:00,14456,"Whether they open a week ago or in 6 months without an effective vaccine when they open the numbers have to go up as long as the hospitals aren’t  full they need to open things up Ontario, Canada, the world will go teats up if we don’t stat back up and if that happens hospitals will close and no support for anything  o money equals many more deaths"
1061631,AKRISONER,2020-05-11 13:46:00,5558,i like what my muni did...kept it closed but allowed the marinas to put local's boats in the water. Stops people from coming from everywhere just to visit the community. If you have property you can come through a controlled environment and launch. (the marinas are being extremely strict and are requiring that you book a time to launch!)
1061635,Woodsman,2020-05-11 15:15:00,1286,"From the press release I seen the only day use activities allowed are walking, hiking, bird watching and biking. Beaches still off limits."
1061636,Terry,2020-05-11 15:19:00,14456,Yeah it sounds like no ramps open. Launching is not a social activity so I don’t why they don’t allow it
1061637,Woodsman,2020-05-11 16:10:00,1286,I agree Terry. Maybe their way of limiting people going to the parks?
1061638,Terry,2020-05-11 16:13:00,14456,I think the problem is the doctors(In charge of health units) that say it’s a high risk activity. Have cabin cruiser or  big sail boats and at a lot of marinas  they have a launching weekend and everyone comes and it’s a party. Everyone helps put the boats in and they drink and bbq  	Which has nothing to do with day trip boat launches  	These people in charge are real world ignorant  	And for that we get screwed
1061646,irishfield,2020-05-11 19:09:00,26272,Penetang and Midland launches still blocked off as of 20 minutes ago... I'm sure they'll stay that way until Marinas are given a green light to allow customers on their docks.
1061658,SirCranksalot,2020-05-12 00:16:00,3291,"Somehow the logic that applies in Penetang, Midland and elsewhere does not apply to Wasaga Beach!!  "
1061662,Fisherman,2020-05-12 01:19:00,7201,Now you know how many lunatics are running the asylums.
1061671,Woodsman,2020-05-12 02:43:00,1286,Looks like one of those doctors sure over stepped it. And not for the first time but this one sure has Human Rights problems all over this one. https://london.ctvnews.ca/farmers-should-throw-them-in-the-garbage-health-unit-issues-controversial-ids-for-migrant-workers-1.4934539?fbclid=IwAR1PmyDO7meHOzhs5Y0hDTCPOi6Mr3UMMQ_f3Ld6c_e4N1mCprw_3Hn4aeo
1061676,nlpaintballer,2020-05-12 10:59:00,122,"Since Haldimand-norfolk is the county that county has said no cottagers (otherwise it's a 5000.00 a day fine), maybe they just want the workers to have a pass that identifies them from the cottagers. That way it's easier for them to issue tickets. Ramps are still open in my area because we don't have the resources in our county to close all the ramps or even try to enforce it. Of course we have only 4 active cases for a population of over 100,000"
1061677,Terry,2020-05-12 12:43:00,14456,The mayors and health units have never had this much power and it’s going to their heads lots of draconian laws out there now
1061682,Fisherman,2020-05-12 13:25:00,7201,I think Innisfil is the synonym of Keswick for the west side of Cooks Bay.
1061685,BillM,2020-05-12 14:08:00,17367,"Now that's funny, lol!!"
