1061041,Snidley,2020-04-29 22:12:00,620,Excellent video. The single hook makes a big difference for snagging. That water looked ideal for using a Rebel Crick Hopper or Big Ant lure as well. Same technique but with a small wiggling lure. I use them always for Steelies but I replace the 2 tiny treble hooks with one (rear) treble hook and in deeper pools I put a bit of BB weight about 2 feet up the line¬† to get it down into the pool while not impeading the action. The steelies get pissed off and really nail it hard.
