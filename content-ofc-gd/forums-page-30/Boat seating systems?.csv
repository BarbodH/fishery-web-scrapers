I just priced out a bunch of Springfield Marine seats bases and pedestals. Boy is their stuff ever pricey!! I’m not married to their system and wondering if there’s other good, readily available systems to go with. I was considering their 2-3/8” taper-lock line  because I can clean out the sockets easily and it does not look like a fight to install or remove the posts. Are there any other good manufacturers lines that I should check out? I need bases, seats, swivels and preferably swivel slide with locks for the passenger and drivers seat. I would like good, rugged quality. And I don’t mind spending a bit of money on it if the quality is superior.  That being said, I do need to cost compare as there’s much more to do on this project than just seating, so if I can save some money for the other goodies I’d be a happy camper.  thanks in advance"
