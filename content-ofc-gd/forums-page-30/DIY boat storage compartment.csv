1061265,moses,2020-05-03 19:35:00,36,Hi group. I have and issue with storage on my 13 ft smoker craft. 2015 I believe. I have a solid floor with a split seat in the middle. I really want a compartment for storage. Is it advisable to remove foam and hinge the lid. to create a storage for my fishing tackle or gear. Will I compromise the boat. Moses 
1061267,Fisherman,2020-05-03 20:27:00,7201,"Boats are built around a structural ""base"", if you decide to change that, the boat may become ""floppy"".  A friend of mine did that, cut out part of the center bench seat, bad move.  The upright walls on either side crack right down to the hull and he needed to get it fixed.  Call Smokercraft, they make them."
1061268,moses,2020-05-03 21:00:00,36,Yes. I'll probably contact them. I know what they will probably say. Come in and talk to us about an upgrade.
1061270,moses,2020-05-03 21:18:00,36, Here's a pic of my split seat . Just want to remove the top. Hinge it. I'd have to remove the foam inside for storage. Thanks for your feed back. Moses  
1061271,Fisherman,2020-05-03 21:33:00,7201,"Well, then your not really removing anything other than foam, maybe you can put the foam in another spot to maintain flotation. Sorry, I misunderstood. Picture helps."
1061272,OhioFisherman,2020-05-03 21:40:00,6623,"Spots on those boats to place flotation look limited to me, and would it required a certified test to confirm the changes aren't unsafe? Just assuming the mfg is aware of storage shortages and would have done that if possible?"
1061273,misfish,2020-05-03 22:17:00,29133,"I believe I bought my 14.6 ft sylvan about 15 years ago . Not sure, but do know the 2nd owner still has it . I wanted a live well and a battery storage box  also a front casting deck . So  I cut a hole in the bow bench . Removed flotation foam, Installed a fabricated aluminum box to hold the battery with a lid. This also balanced the boat out with having a 20 hp merc and 6 hp kicker on the stern . The middle seat, I cut a 10 x 30 area out.  Removed flotation foam .Installed another fabricated aluminum box with lid, which was my live well. Installed air rater and bilge . Never really effected the boat or the way it floated or handled. Like I said, the 2nd owner still has and uses it .  For what you want to do, I would not even 2nd guess. Just do it."
1061281,moses,2020-05-04 02:03:00,36,Thanks. Sounds good 
1061283,Musky Plug,2020-05-04 02:46:00,398,Did this exact same thing on my last boat. 14’ crestliner.  Cut a 16” long opening removed foam for storage in the front bench. In the middle bench cut a 24” long opening removed foam and installed welded aluminum box with lid about 20”long x 8” deep x 6” height with recirc pump. Also didn’t affect boat performance. Just make sure to not affect your boat’s structure.
1061284,moses,2020-05-04 02:49:00,36,Thanks for your feed back. Because my boat is like New I'm always leery to drill holes in my boat. I'm getting over it.

1061337,moses,2020-05-05 02:31:00,36,I still have two full bench seat full of foam and floor. I get what your saying.
