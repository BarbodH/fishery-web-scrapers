1061450,PUMP KNOWS,2020-05-06 21:22:00,937,You’re not missing out on anything over here.  I wish I fished your tribs.
1061484,Bill,2020-05-07 10:49:00,140,Nice catches. Thanks for sharing
1061492,mamona,2020-05-07 13:49:00,597,"Very interesting, enjoyed the video."
1061500,msp,2020-05-07 16:33:00,1336,Its amazing how hard they smash the hardware. well done !
1061517,PUMP KNOWS,2020-05-08 03:53:00,937,Thanks guys 👍 it’s a great indicator when you know the fish are very aggressive.  I’ve had days when they wouldn’t hit a lure and would only take offerings under a float.
1061528,steellee,2020-05-08 14:55:00,21,Take it you just customized a black/gold rapala. Looks awesome. I do it often to my hardbaits too. Also like the spiral wrap rod you're running
1061586,PUMP KNOWS,2020-05-10 02:35:00,937,"I wish I was talented to customize my own baits but this was bought like that.  I wish I had a few more because I already lost 1 to a steelhead I bought this spiral wrap last fall and I’m liking it a lot.  I still gotta learn how to fight fish with a baitcaster, I find the drag not as smooth as a spinning reel.
