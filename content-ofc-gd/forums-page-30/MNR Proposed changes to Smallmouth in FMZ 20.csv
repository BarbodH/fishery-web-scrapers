1061706,KraTToR,2020-05-12 22:39:00,506,"The Ministry is seeking public input on proposed changes to the bass angling season in Fisheries Management Zone 20 (FMZ20) 	including separate open season dates for Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass and options for early season bass angling. 	Fisheries Management Concern 	The Ministry is concerned about the future of the 	Smallmouth Bass (SMB) bass fishery in FMZ20. Recent 	science indicates the current open season date (3rd Saturday 	in June) provides little protection to spawning fish which 	could result in a long-term population decline and reduced 	social and economic benefits. The current open season date 	for Largemouth Bass (LMB) provides sufficient protection. 	Fishing Seasons – Bass Management 	Typically, bass angling season is closed during spawning time 	to improve reproductive success. Bass are especially 	vulnerable during spawning because they guard their nest 	against predators and can be easily caught by anglers. Nest 	predation by Round Gobies and other species following the 	removal of the parent, even for short periods of time, has 	been well documented. 	Bass Spawning Time in Lake Ontario 	In southern Ontario, the timing and duration of bass 	spawning is closely related to water temperature and 	generally occurs from mid-May to mid-July. 	In Lake Ontario, LMB and SMB are typically found in different 	habitats which warm up at different rates in the spring. 	SMB that occupy deeper cold-water habitats in the main Lake 	and in the St. Lawrence River have been observed spawning 	much later than LMB in the warmer near shore areas. 	Changes to the FMZ20 Bass Season in 2013 	In 2013 the opening of bass season was made earlier by one 	week to open on the 3 	rd Saturday in June. At the time, it was 	believed that the earlier date aligned well with LMB spawning 	activity but there were concerns from stakeholders that SMB 	may not be sufficiently protected. MNRF acknowledged the 	potential risk to SMB and agreed to monitor the fishery and 	make adjustments if necessary. 	New Science - FMZ20 Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass spawning 	Queens University researchers, led by Dr. Bruce Tufts 	, conducted a three year study from 2014-2017 to evaluate the 	amount of protection provided by the current closed season for bass angling. The study examined the timing of spawning 	and development from egg to the swim-up fry stage (free swimming juvenile fish) for both LMB and SMB in the eastern basin 	of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. Reaching the swim –up fry stage (free swimming juvenile fish) is considered a 	nest protection threshold. Once “swim-up” is attained the nest is considered to be successful. 	The researchers conclude that there are important differences in the timing of spawning between the two species in Lake 	Ontario and the Upper St. Lawrence River and that the current dates for the open season provide minimal protection to 	Smallmouth Bass.  	Largemouth Bass and Smallmouth Bass can be distinguished by 	several anatomical features. They also prefer different habitats that 	impact spawning duration and the rate of juvenile development. Proposed Bass Fishing Season Change Fisheries Management Zone 20 	Keys findings from the Queens University Study: 	• By the 3rd Saturday in June (June 19 during the 3 year study) on 	average: 	• 58% of LMB nests had reached the swim-up developmental 	stage when parental guarding is complete. 	• 8% of SMB nests reached the swim-up development stage. 	• The difference between the bass species largely reflects the 	habitat preference for each species. 	• Nest observations were modelled using average seasonal 	temperature data to estimate the additional time required to 	improve spawning success. The data from the study indicates 	that on average 50% of SMB nests should reach swim-up stage 	by July 1st (Figure 1) 	Fisheries management perspective: achieving 50% nest success 	(nests with swim-up fry) should be considered a safe long-term 	management goal, while striving for 80% success is unrealistic and 	doesn’t typically occur in nature. 	Figure 1: By Bass season opening weekend (June 19 during 3- 	year study) only 8% of Smallmouth Bass nests have swim-up 	fry. An opening date of July 1st would offer protection for 50% 	of Smallmouth Bass nests. 	Management Options Considered: 	The Ministry, with the support of the FMZ20 Fisheries Advisory Council, considered the new research and evaluated a range 	of management options to improve protection of SMB including: 1) maintaining status quo - keeping bass opener the 3rd 	weekend in June; 2) change the opening date to July 1st for both LMB and SMB; 3) dividing the Zone into smaller sub-zones 	with a mid June opening date for warm areas (embayments) and July 1st for cold areas (open water areas) and 4) split the 	open season date for LMB (mid June) and SMB (July 1). The Ministry and the FMZ20 Council also considered and developed 	options for early season (pre-spawn) bass angling opportunities. Similar early season angling opportunities exist in several US 	States and in North Western Ontario. 	Proposed FMZ20 Regular Season For Bass 	Different opening season dates for Largemouth Bass and 	Smallmouth Bass: 	• Largemouth Bass – 3rd Saturday in June to December 	31 	• Smallmouth Bass – open 1st Saturday in July to 	December 31 	Maintain the aggregate catch and possession limits - Sport 	(6) and Conservation (2) for LMB and SMB combined. 	Rationale: This option provides sufficient protection for 	Smallmouth Bass, maintains and enhances angling and 	social and economic opportunities and is not overly 	complicated. 	Proposed Early Season Angling Options 	1. Early season angling for LMB and SMB (January 1 to 	May ) with catch and release (no harvest). 10 	2. (January season SMB Early for LMB and 1 to May 10) 	Conservation with reduced daily catch limit - Sport (2) 	(1) (catch and - exception: no early season harvest 	release only) in small waterbodies in FMZ20 such as: 	Lake Consecon, East and West Roblin Lake, Fish Lake, 	Lake, Lake on the Mountain Wellers Bay, Pleasant Bay, 	Hamilton Harbour 	3. Maintain status quo – no early season 	In both early season options (1 & 2) the season is closed between 	May 10 and the proposed opening date. (No bass angling would 	be allowed when the majority of bass are staging and spawning.) 	Provide Feedback 	The public is encouraged to provided feedback on the proposal changes to the regular season and the early season angling 	options. Please indicate by March 31, 2020 whether you support the proposed regular season and which early season 	option you prefer.

1061714,AKRISONER,2020-05-13 02:24:00,5558,The best thing for that fishery would be to not allow B1 to kill 400 4lb smallmouth over the course of a weekend without penalty.
1061719,grimsbylander,2020-05-13 04:39:00,3016,"“Not only did they kill 183 bass, they killed 183 of thebiggest bass in the area.” 	Last time you posted about this it was 183 bass and now they all 4 lber’s too! Exaggerating does nothing to gain credibility. It’s not great that it happened but suggesting THAT is a solution as opposed to seasonal adjustments is simply ridiculous."
1061721,dave524,2020-05-13 10:20:00,4508,"At Port Colborne and Long Point , there are sanctuary areas that don't open till 2 weeks after the regular opener. Been like that for all my 70 years, simple old solution to the problem, don't waste our money on analyzing the problem further, committees, boards, public feedback, just do it. As for preseasonn catch and release only ? I don't think many keep bass even during the open season."
1061724,AKRISONER,2020-05-13 11:43:00,5558,"I think when I last posted about it, the tournament wasn’t even over yet. They had over 100 competitors fish for 2 days with a 98% (I think is what I last read?) mortality rate. My original math was actually too low the first time I posted about this. Friggin unbelievable really? And on the st Lawrence? Not too many competitors coming in with less than 3lbers. im 100% a fan of bass tournaments, and am not one of the “anti tournament crowd” I realize bass tournaments are what literally keeps the entire fishing industry afloat for the most part because of the accessibility of it...but seriously, what happened there was simply not acceptable and means that either the company needs to invest more to manage fish suffering from Barotrauma, and hire some people that know what the heck they are doing. I don’t have the answers, but in speaking with a local, he has noticed a substantial decline in fishing in the area and it’s pretty apparent that it’s the tournaments that are causing it."
1061730,grimsbylander,2020-05-13 13:18:00,3016,"The tournament ran July 13/14...your post was July 24 so yes it was over.  	Everyone agrees that was an especially bad tournament for the mortality rate and because it’s a catch and release format, they need to do better during times of extreme weather. What I take issue with, is throwing one tournament series and one especially poor tournament out as a solution for an entire zone."
1061742,AKRISONER,2020-05-13 15:48:00,5558,"There’s a lot to the equation, but seriously that tournament alone had a devestating impact on the local fish population. Considering it specifically targeted the largest best spawning fish and killed hundreds of them from a specific stretch of water. That specific area is host to many many tournaments. If they continue to have the same problem’s it will literally finish the fishery off for good. Not far different from what happens in the lakes in the southern United States. Guntersville, santee Cooper, Kentucky lake, chickmauga all are tough fisheries and it’s because of the pounding that their tournaments place on their lakes. Even worse down there because they hammer them during the spawn. I fished santee Cooper last year and got skunked for three days straight, during the spring! That’s telling of what’s happened to that lake because of the extreme spawn tournament pressure considering a decade ago it was taking 40lbs pushing 50! In some instances to win tournaments on it. once again, I’m not anti tournament, but I’m also not anti common sense. We are blessed with the literal best bass fishing in the entire world in Ontario. If capitalist organizations want to use the resource as a revenue source, they should be held accountable for the health of the fishery. thats part of the problem, the outright disconnect between our tournament fishing organizations in canada and conservation efforts. whats going on in Texas with their share lunkers program is something that’s imo desperately needed up here in canada along with our already tight seasonal regulations."
1061760,grimsbylander,2020-05-13 20:16:00,3016,Loose facts = knee jerk reactions. Not sure why the MNR hasn’t caught on to your simple solution.
1061773,AKRISONER,2020-05-13 23:21:00,5558,"I don’t have a solution, I don’t know enough to know what the solution is nor do I have the resources available to me to know. Corporations and the government do though. Hence my point. The total lack of repercussions/changes to ensure that it never happens again is what I take issue with."
1061774,Jon,2020-05-13 23:37:00,209,I thought input for this proposal closed March 31st? FMZ20 Bass Season Proposed Changes Jon
1061779,grimsbylander,2020-05-14 01:22:00,3016,"You’re talking in circles. 	“The best thing for that fishery would be...”. Sounds like a solution to me. Please explain where you got the information that confirms there is a “total lack of repercussions/changes to ensure that it never happens again”. You know this how? Explain your research. The irony here is they practice catch and release because they care about the fishery. The truth is they can make it a derby, bonk fish on the head and be well within the limits. The MNR works hard to protect our fisheries so I ask, did the MNR lay charges(repercussions), cancel or issue controls on B1? Why not? "
1061789,singingdog,2020-05-14 11:31:00,1047,"Tournament fishing doesn't drive anything but more tournament fishing. It has absolutely nothing to do with why, or how I fish."
1061790,AKRISONER,2020-05-14 11:45:00,5558,"...except for any rods, reels, electronics, mapping software, trolling motors etc etc etc (should i go on?) that you use. All of that tech, refinement etc etc is alllll driven by the bass fishing and inshore fishing industry by our friends in the united states. The refinement of lures and reels comes from the guys on literally one specific lake (Lake Biwa) in Japan. Its the exact same relationship that F1 maintains with the car industry. Youd think that F1 has absolutely nothing to do with the pickup truck that you drive...except for the fact that every single vehicle produced has a limited slip differential in it. Trust me, the canadian tinner based walleye/trout fisherman makes up the smallest amount of revenue in the entire industry. Was talking with Dave Chong last week about this, the entirety of Canadian Bass Boat sales is trumped by almost any singular state in the United States. Thats pretty unbelievable isnt it? Population, and buying power, a strong dollar are pretty incredible things. Grimsby, the MNR by law openly publishes any charges/fines that they impose on people. Its all public record. I know that B1 addressed the issue because of Optics...which in any corporation are as important as almost anything. Could you imagine the optics in 2020 of catch and kill tournaments? Weve gone way past that, but personally I think even more can be done. Just look at what MLF is doing. (I dont personally know if that specifically is the answer because I still think weigh in's add a certain dynamic to tournament fishing) but at the same time this wasnt a small local family tournament, B1 is the real deal, big money, big names and they really really messed up. Im glad they addressed it, but I stand by my opinion that  after seeing what happened happen, we should be doing more to protect our fisheries and to make sure that it doesnt happen again. We may just have a difference of opinions on the matter."
1061792,Terry,2020-05-14 12:08:00,14456,"Tournaments has changed fishing in every way not just bass tournaments Walleye trout salmon panfish and  Muskie  	the sharing of information has changed  all aspects of fishing where , why and how we fish "
1061798,KraTToR,2020-05-14 13:43:00,506,"How did this turn into a tournament thing??? lol It seems that largies are ok because they spawn in warm shallow bays, not so much for the smallies, especially on the great lakes.  If you fish the opener at long point you'll notice that the SM population isn't what it used to be, quite possibly the hundreds of boats pulling them off their nest before the eggs have hatched or the fry haven't reached the freedom stage?
