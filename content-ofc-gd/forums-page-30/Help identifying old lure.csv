1061952,bam7mm,2020-05-17 12:57:00,1,Found this and some other old lures  
1061954,HikeClimbPaddle,2020-05-17 13:11:00,2,"I don't know, but by the looks of it I'm guessing the action is pretty good eh"
1061956,bushart,2020-05-17 13:48:00,2628,"Pretty sure it's an early version of a ""Dying Flutter"""
1061958,dave524,2020-05-17 14:50:00,4508,"I'd say it is a Heddon Dowagiac Minnow , but missing the front hooks. Worth some bucks in good condition with the box. Scroll down a bit   https://www.wideopenspaces.com/9-old-fishing-lures-tackle-box-just-hit-payday/"
1061959,Woodsman,2020-05-17 14:59:00,1286,Front hooks may have been removed so it would be legal to use here in Ontario
1061962,dave524,2020-05-17 15:25:00,4508,"The old days when the flatfish with 2 pairs of trebles on those hangers/spreaders were illegal too, could not even use 2 trebles on a musky quick strike harness."
1061963,OhioFisherman,2020-05-17 15:58:00,6623,"https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2499334.m570.l1313.TR1.TRC0.A0.H0.TRS0&_nkw=Heddon+Dowagiac+Minnow&_sacat=36169 Unless you are a lure collector and really know what you are doing you don't want to fiddle with those old lures, even attempting to clean them might cause some damage. i believe Dave made the right call on the lure, evidently there was a 3 and 5 hook version. That swivel on the front does not appear to be standard, again though, not an expert. Condition means a lot, but so does the rarity of the color and original packaging and any paperwork that went with the item. "
1061978,John Bacon,2020-05-17 22:50:00,3277,"When would Flatfish have been illegal?  For as long as I can remember, a treble counted as one hook when attached to an artificial lure, and four hooks were allowed per line.  So, four trebles on a lure would have been legal under those rules.  	Under the new rules, a treble counts as one hook regardless of whether it's attached to an artificial lure or not."
1061998,dave524,2020-05-18 12:25:00,4508,"Early '80's a treble still counted as 3 when live bait fishing, hence sucker rigs for Musky used a single and 1 treble. Later the rule was changed so a treble was considered 1 hook . A treble was always considered 1 hook for artificial  lures but only 3 were allowed on a plug, not sure when that was upped, definitely the rule in the '60/70's."
1062002,John Bacon,2020-05-18 14:42:00,3277,It was definitely four in the mid-eighties.  I didn't read the regs before that; so you could be right about a three hook limit in 60/70s.
