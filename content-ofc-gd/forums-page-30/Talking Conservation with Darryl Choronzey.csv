1061899,Lord Letto,2020-05-15 20:58:00,70,"I know Fish'n Canada started back in 1986 (so 34 years ago), Started with Reno & Angelo, Pete never came on as a host alongside them till later, his first appearance (named appearance anyway, not sure if he could be seen in the background of other episodes) was Episode 10 of 13 in Season 1 (1986) I'm not sure how old Pete is, but assuming late teens/early 20's back then, he sure looks good for being in his 50's i'm assuming."
