1062198,Weeds,2020-05-23 16:03:00,782,You haven’t heard? They’re getting rid of spring. Cost cutting.
1062199,AKRISONER,2020-05-23 16:13:00,5558,Supposed to be 30 come Tuesday...literally woke up to this 10 days ago?   
1062201,lew,2020-05-23 16:49:00,12766,I just came in from cutting grass for an hour and said to my wife that we seem to have jumped from a cold wet spring to mid-July in a few days  LOL

1062206,BillM,2020-05-23 18:04:00,17367,I'd like spring please.  Not ready for mid to high 20 degree temps just yet.
1062207,Terry,2020-05-23 18:52:00,14456,I would take spring all year long. I hate the heat of summer
1062208,Old Ironmaker,2020-05-23 19:15:00,8243,It seems like I woke up one day and there are leaves on the maple trees and green buds on the rest. Gardens pop up over night too.
