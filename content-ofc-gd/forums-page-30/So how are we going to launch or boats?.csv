1061468,panners,2020-05-07 00:06:00,7,Lol. Protests here are like setting up a road side coolaid stand with free coolaid and an apology to go along with it. The odd Militia group wouldn‚Äôt hurt here I suppose.
1061475,AKRISONER,2020-05-07 02:49:00,5558,Because we are smart enough to know that a boat ramp is less important than the lives of our fellow Canadians and the safety of our healthcare workers.  it sucks but we are putting faith in those that make the decisions are doing so in our best interest. boat ramps will re-open...when it is safe to do so which sounds like it will be soon.

1061193,AKRISONER,2020-05-02 12:00:00,5558,Speculating but I think they realize the financial impact that missing one of the four long weekends in a summer can have on marinas etc. I think dougie wants to give those businesses a break and get them running before the long weekend. im getting tired of working on my boat and not launching it lol...that first tank of gas is gonna be gonnnneeeee lol
1061222,Hack_Fisherman,2020-05-02 23:15:00,720,I heard that Premier Ford has allowed marinas to start preparing for the season. I hope that means public launches¬†are next
1061223,Woodsman,2020-05-02 23:42:00,1286,Unless in a marina or provincial park in most cases the public launches have not been shutdown by the province. That is on the local governments.
1061224,Terry,2020-05-02 23:46:00,14456,I have to believe every boater looking for an open ramp knows that But as ¬†marinas ramps open we all hope the municipalities see the light and open them too
1061225,Woodsman,2020-05-03 00:01:00,1286,Terry I wish you were correct but I see many posts on here and other sites trying to put the blame squarely on the province for all the ramp closures.
1061240,Canuck,2020-05-03 13:26:00,491,"So our marina can prep for launch, but for most of us that do all our own prep, we still can't go to the marina to get things ready.¬† No way I will let them launch my boat without me being there to make sure its properly prepped, properly tied up, canvas on properly, charger on.¬† So I will have to wait.¬† they won't even let me go get my dinghy off the bow so I could at least get on the water with that at the cottage.¬† Sooooo frustrating"

1060582,north560,2020-04-22 21:00:00,38,Up north you may need the skidoo to launch your boat. Lake still making ice.
1060583,AKRISONER,2020-04-22 21:09:00,5558,"supposed to be -12 in my neck of the woods, shes gonna ice up again lol second ice fishing season maybe?"

1060597,irishfield,2020-04-22 22:51:00,26272,Making ice every night this week...
1060621,Garnet,2020-04-23 10:58:00,2056,I sure learning will continue. Everyday the boat is launched something is learned.
1060897,irishfield,2020-04-27 17:04:00,26272,You'll have a hard time launching in Penetang or Midland. Shot I grabbed while we were out doing some essential travel to the banks outer wall deposit slot.

1060917,AKRISONER,2020-04-27 20:30:00,5558,Was announced today that opening parks is part of the first ‚Äúphase‚Äù of covid restriction reduction. So that‚Äôs about as good of news as we can get. I think May 2-4 might be the target but I‚Äôm just speculating.
1060918,BillM,2020-04-27 20:40:00,17367,"It could be under 1 or 2, clear as mud really."
1060921,John Bacon,2020-04-27 20:54:00,3277,"Going by this, it looks more like Stage 2 to me.¬† But hopefully it will be in Stage 1. Phase 2: Restart Ontario will take a three-stage approach to loosening emergency measures and reopening the economy: Stage 1:¬†Open select workplaces under modified operations (ex. curb-side pickup and deliveries), allow some small gatherings like funerals Stage 2:¬†Open more workplaces (may include some service industries, office and retail businesses), outdoor spaces, and allow some larger gatherings Stage 3:¬†Further relax the restrictions of public gatherings (large public gatherings like concerts and sporting events still be restricted), opening all workplaces responsibly"
1060929,Pigeontroller,2020-04-27 23:11:00,2793,This is getting to me! I wanna go fishing! Getting to do a burnout in Wayne's roadrunner would help!
1060995,GaraldT,2020-04-29 05:51:00,52,All parks to remain closed until May 31st was just announced last week. Brutal! https://www.ontarioparks.com/covid19
1060998,Bill,2020-04-29 11:25:00,140,I had the opportunity to buy a metallic green one back in the day. I thought the guy wanted too much so I foolishly passed on it.

1061018,Terry,2020-04-29 15:55:00,14456,Last I heard it‚Äôs how they are going to do it but they have not set a date. So it could be two weeks or two months ¬†or six months
1061045,irishfield,2020-04-29 23:16:00,26272,"Quebec has stated people can start going to their cottages North of Montreal starting May 4th, yet our local Health Board head is petitioning Ford to make it law Ontarians can't go to theirs!"
1059574,captpierre,2020-04-12 17:40:00,2521,Marinas and municipal launches closed for now üò≥

1059582,BillM,2020-04-12 18:40:00,17367,Beaches always worked when I was a kid.
1059586,Terry,2020-04-12 19:05:00,14456,"You look on google earth ¬†for cottages with their own boat ramps. ¬† Then¬†you drive by to see if they came up from the city if not ,you launch there and park in their¬†driveway the fine for trespassing 80 bucks the fine for launching at a posted ramp 800. Bucks you do the math. ¬†LOL"
1059588,misfish,2020-04-12 19:17:00,29133,"Park where allowed, put toon on shoulders,walk,slip toon into water and row . FISH. Repeat reverse when leaving . Pretty simple to me .  And yes come May opener if they do not close lakes to fishing, I will be performing said above Be well, be safe all ..  I wont be launching here, but you get the point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LOL Lift and slip,shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  "

1059602,Gil Levesque,2020-04-12 22:13:00,103,"Dont know how to share a link on my phone,but just read Michigan has banned all powered boats! Yikes!!"
1059605,grimsbylander,2020-04-12 22:21:00,3016,Throw a rake or a lawnmower in the truck and spend a half hour as repayment. You‚Äôd probably end up with permission to a private ramp.
1059608,kickingfrog,2020-04-12 23:04:00,8333,I've ordered 2 giant rubber bands and a ramp¬†from ACME. ¬†Most of the ratings were very good¬†but someone with the handle W.E. Coyote only gave it half a star. Photos to follow.

1059637,AKRISONER,2020-04-13 12:12:00,5558,In my yard once the spring mud dries up a bit. Luckily I‚Äôve got the rare gentle sand beach shoreline on Georgia bay! Heck if the water wasn‚Äôt so high itd be super easy. Might need to use a couple of sheets of plywood just to keep the tractor from sinking too much!

1059656,Garnet,2020-04-13 14:39:00,2056,Just reading a Rice Lake Boating Community's Post. States If your address is on the lake you can use launch and take truck trailer home. So nobody in village of Bewdley can launch if they are caught on water. They are not water front. Also anybody that owns a cottage on Rice will not be able to launch because there address will be else where. Sounds like cottage association bull. 
1059658,Terry,2020-04-13 14:55:00,14456,If you have to ask you don‚Äôt have the same type of humorist mind as I I thought it was damn funny
1059667,misfish,2020-04-13 16:09:00,29133,"Yup, and I fish with him . LOL"
1059681,grimsbylander,2020-04-13 17:31:00,3016,I bought one...when I pulled the lever the boat stayed and the lake took off.
1059695,BillM,2020-04-13 20:29:00,17367,I'm going fishing with Terry.
1059700,irishfield,2020-04-13 21:03:00,26272,"I thought it was a great plan ! Leah's dumass Father hasn't come back from the USA yet, so you could use his laneway and launch.. directly in from the channel can..."
