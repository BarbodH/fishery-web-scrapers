1061827,Terry,2020-05-14 22:27:00,14456,Yup I am booked for Saturday morning. We will see how that works out
1061829,dave524,2020-05-14 22:32:00,4508,"In '68 dad bought a cottage on Loon/Dudmon Lake in Haliburton for $8800, sold it in the late '80s for ten times that. It has been extensively renovated but I ran across it up for rent a few years ago , would have cost the same $8800 to rent for 4 weeks 🤯"
1061830,misfish,2020-05-14 22:52:00,29133,"Would love to be there and cheer for you bud, but I will be at my toon launch. I will be thinking about you though. You know where I will be."

1061834,irishfield,2020-05-15 02:40:00,26272,"Georgina opening all of their launches, no stipulations other than social distancing and listening to their staff."
1061836,Terry,2020-05-15 09:18:00,14456,According to the mayor everyone around the lake except Barrie tried to open on the same day
1061837,AKRISONER,2020-05-15 10:29:00,5558,Sounds like a lot of us will be fishing this weekend. I leave for pointe au baril at 8! Boat will be in the water by noon! Stay safe everyone and remember to bring gloves/sanitizer with you if you go to the launch. The docks etc etc can be contaminated! Stay safe and tight lines WOOO HOOOO!!!
1061840,misfish,2020-05-15 11:00:00,29133,"Thats cuz they need cranes to remove the huge barriers. LOL Heading out in a bit, will have an update."
1061843,kickingfrog,2020-05-15 12:20:00,8333,Heads up. This morning the radio is saying that many municipalities in Simcoe County are not opening public launches until later. Might what to check before dragging your boat to your usual spot.
1061846,Terry,2020-05-15 13:34:00,14456,For sure if the municipality hasn’t announced the ramp is open. Chances are it’s not both Keswick and Innisfil posted on their websites which ramps are open
1061850,misfish,2020-05-15 13:59:00,29133,"As I arrived,they were removing the last concrete barrier at Tiffen. Talking to one of the guys,resident only. That is just hear say."
1061852,cheaptackle,2020-05-15 14:10:00,849,Orillia just announced ramps will be open Saturday. 
1061878,BillM,2020-05-15 18:00:00,17367,"My precious will be released this weekend, or maybe early next week.  Who knows."

Members of the public will be allowed to launch their boats, in groups of less than five people who maintain a physical distance of at least six feet from each other. “Kawartha Lakes continues to take all necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of residents and staff,” states the municipality in a media release. “Boat launches will continue to be monitored closely and the closures could be reinstated if the municipality sees any increased signs of risk.”"
1061530,AKRISONER,2020-05-08 15:26:00,5558,hope my muni follows suit! we shall see

1061549,kickingfrog,2020-05-08 23:10:00,8333,Sarcasm.
1061550,AKRISONER,2020-05-08 23:12:00,5558,just to correct you...Thursday May 14th is their targeted opening. its posted on the kawarthas website
1061557,BillM,2020-05-09 03:21:00,17367,"I'll lose sleep over important things, not being able to fish while a pandemic plays out isn't one of them."
1061566,Fisherman,2020-05-09 15:17:00,7201,"With the amount of snow coming down, it looks more like a relapse of winter than spring.  Bull granola weather.  Robins have 3 little ones and worms have gone back deep."
1061567,panners,2020-05-09 15:25:00,7,It’s a late spring again so no rush. I have my own ramp and was out for short while a week ago when it was nice out. Lake was nice and quiet. Nice to see the return or the Loons getting ready to nest. As an avid angler I was humbled by the experience and realized that we need to slow down and not be so spoiled and impatient. I now feel that our lakes are much too busy with boaters and anglers anyway. Stop and smell the air and Just listen. What a beautiful country we have and we should be more appreciative for what we are so fortunate to be a part of.
1061570,misfish,2020-05-09 15:51:00,29133,"Yup  I was not about to go out and sit and get soaked. South side of the bay was nice,north side was a snow squall. Of course,I wanted to fish the north side .LOL Will see what Sunday brings ."
1061571,Fisherman,2020-05-09 15:57:00,7201,"Well according to these guys, a little less windy tomorrow and warmer. https://www.ventusky.com/?p=44.48;-79.18;8&l=gust&t=20200510/1500"

1061595,AKRISONER,2020-05-10 13:01:00,5558,Pointe au baril marinas are now open to ratepayers. No visitors allowed still. guess I’m in luck!
1061597,captpierre,2020-05-10 13:34:00,2521,I can hear the bugs giggling 😎

I don't know if public docs and piers will be open, but that is not the reason. My dad passed away 2 weeks ago from a ruptured abdominal aneurysm. Taking care of my mom well being is more important to me.  To all those that are going fishing good luck and catch one for my dad."

1061775,panners,2020-05-13 23:40:00,7,Absolutely
1061787,fisher,2020-05-14 11:15:00,451,The wait will be over on Saturday. Today Ford is announcing Marinas can start to open to the public starting Saturday. I hope the municipalities open up public launches at the same time. I would petition your councillor today.
1061797,AKRISONER,2020-05-14 13:14:00,5558,"Just proving how fast this stuff is moving, my township wrote up a document about opening the township marina, but got too tied up in the ""making this stuff only available for people with property in pointe au baril"" language, that the wording now implies that if you have road access even if you live in pointe au baril full time that you cant use the boat launch. Ive contacted the muni to see whats the deal."
1061825,LefroyFisherman,2020-05-14 22:15:00,602,"Sounds like Innisfil just opened their launch but residents only and you have too book your launch and pick up time lol, that will be interesting"
1061293,lastcall,2020-05-04 14:51:00,33,exactly!
1061322,AKRISONER,2020-05-04 22:58:00,5558,Announced today parts are going to be open very soon should things keep trending the right direction!!! We’re in business baby!
1061323,misfish,2020-05-04 23:05:00,29133,"Please post link to what you are stating  .  Many report stuff, but it,s a ghost theory lol."
1061324,AKRISONER,2020-05-04 23:07:00,5558,lets goooooo!!!!
1061325,misfish,2020-05-04 23:12:00,29133,"Parks and curb side has been going on for a while now. We need solid opening, but that will be BABY STEPS. I am waiting so badly for my curb side pick up at cabelas this week so I can tie more flys and forget about baking carbs.LOL"
1061326,Terry,2020-05-04 23:14:00,14456,His provincial parks and all retail but he also implied about three weeks away 
1061327,Fisherman,2020-05-04 23:28:00,7201,"Funny thing is I picked up my flowers and tomato's last saturday morning.  Called 2 days ahead, placed order, picked my pick up time and paid.  Went there at the prescribed time,  person comes and gets my order number, radios it to inside, out comes the cart with my order,  loaded into truck and outa there in about 10n minutes.  Very efficient.   Now if they would smack the dingbats in the grocery stores that just have to squeeze every damn loaf of bread and tomato, it would make me very happy."
1061328,misfish,2020-05-04 23:35:00,29133,"Oh come on now. I am sure you still like the odd squeeze of the walnuts,,,,,,,,,,,,🤣"
1061331,BillM,2020-05-05 00:34:00,17367,Well I got a new axle and some bigger rims/tires for the Lund.  Let's get this party started.
1061355,misfish,2020-05-05 14:43:00,29133,"So they open the garden gallery curbside pick up. That is great. It,s a start right ? Seems some are complaining they can not go and pick out what they want. Some people are just ignorant. Be thankful they even open. I started my mini grow today. Starting with chives . Will be starting peppers and tomatoes later after the snow fall this weekend.LOL. I have to grow everything in a large garden pot. But I am good with that. Anyone do those hanging tomato plants ?"
1061358,John Bacon,2020-05-05 15:23:00,3277,I have one that I have used a few times.  They work as long as you keep them watered. 
1061380,Woodsman,2020-05-05 21:36:00,1286,I tried for 2 years when I moved here. Didn't work for me. But I can't really blame the hanging basket system. I just don't get enough direct sun light. Got tomatoes but couldn't get them to ripen.
1061418,DanD,2020-05-06 14:26:00,2223,"Hey guys now that this thread's gone off the rails (not a bad thing); try hydroponics; no matter what scale (size of system) you use; it works great. I made up a system last year and couldn't believe the yield I got. Strawberries, lettuce, cabbage and peppers. Not sure what I'm putting in this year? It's easy just change the nutrients (Fertilizer) every other week and your done. No weeding, no bugs (cut worms to kill your veg) just watch for Afedes; a spray of dish washing soup and water will take care of them. These systems would be great for an apartment baloney,  Build to size of space; very versatile. I have (or hopefully will have again) a summer trailer and they do not allow gardens. Don't want the lots to get dug up; I guess? That's why I built this hydroponic garden. We couldn't eat the stuff as fast as it grew; so it became my neighbors veggie stand. Take what you want/need but leave me some. LOL Dan.  "
1061419,Fisherman,2020-05-06 14:40:00,7201,"After 4 pages of the wrong answers, I think the OP should go back and re phrase the title to ""When"" not ""How""  are we going to launch,  unless someone invents a trailer/boat catapult with some sort of end of the day retrieval system."
1061455,panners,2020-05-06 22:40:00,7,You park in my driveway and use my ramp I will drag your trailer and truck down the road to have it stripped and wait for you at my dock. Prepare to start bailing.
1061459,Terry,2020-05-06 23:30:00,14456,Cameras are active in my truck and I could use the insurance and they haven’t taken my assault rifles yet so fun wow but I take you you didn’t find my joke funny
1061460,Hollada,2020-05-06 23:32:00,1,Why don’t Canadians protest these over-reaching acts by your government?
1061463,porkpie,2020-05-06 23:54:00,2521,"Some are, but Canada is different than the USA.  It takes a lot to get Canadians fighting mad and it hasn’t got to that point.  If it drags on a lot longer it will happen more and more."
1061466,panners,2020-05-07 00:01:00,7,I did. Just a heads up. 😉
1061468,panners,2020-05-07 00:06:00,7,Lol. Protests here are like setting up a road side coolaid stand with free coolaid and an apology to go along with it. The odd Militia group wouldn’t hurt here I suppose.
1061475,AKRISONER,2020-05-07 02:49:00,5558,Because we are smart enough to know that a boat ramp is less important than the lives of our fellow Canadians and the safety of our healthcare workers.  it sucks but we are putting faith in those that make the decisions are doing so in our best interest. boat ramps will re-open...when it is safe to do so which sounds like it will be soon.
1061476,BillM,2020-05-07 03:19:00,17367,What are we going to protest against?  The fact boat ramps are closed?  Bigger things in life to lose sleep over.
1061519,fisher,2020-05-08 10:47:00,451,"With that attitude I guess you will rarely, if ever, lose sleep.   Good for you. my bet is that even if launches open up, municipalities will put some sort of restriction/by law in place to prevent out of towners from using ‘their’ boat ramps.  Sad days for many reasons."
1061522,Terry,2020-05-08 12:31:00,14456,"No restrictions lake of bays  Muskoka Kawarthas , Picton  kingston  Belleville but around lake simcoe they are talking about restrictions"
1061523,Garnet,2020-05-08 12:52:00,2056,Belleville launches open today. Kawaratha  Lakes launches open May 15 next fri. All social distance rules apply.
1061048,LeXXington,2020-04-29 23:39:00,1928,Wait till after May 1st.. The number of people \ business that have to skip on the rent payments in Toronto my force the door to open a little.  
1061052,Bill,2020-04-30 00:29:00,140,I would be pretty close if I had to guess what you have spent on the car. I work at a auto restoration business near Blenheim Ontario. But really a vehicle's value is  the owner's sentimental value. I have owned a 1969 Chevelle 300 Deluxe since 1979. I have refused ridiculous amounts of money from hopeful buyers because I do not want to sell it.
1061149,Terry,2020-05-01 18:48:00,14456,Today ford said some businesses can open Monday and starting Monday marinas can prepare to open. So that’s a start
1061151,misfish,2020-05-01 19:17:00,29133,"I got a text today, my toon marina is open. Guess Loony Tooner guys have essential access .🤣"
1061152,Terry,2020-05-01 19:20:00,14456,I hope I can get my folding boat in the same spot
1061153,kickingfrog,2020-05-01 19:45:00,8333,Property owners only pay property taxes on the days they are at their cottage right?
1061154,misfish,2020-05-01 19:55:00,29133,Toons only. Fold boat marina is still closed.🖐️
1061164,knightfisher,2020-05-01 22:46:00,237,Just heard Ford will be giving marinas the okay to open around May 4th
1061166,Terry,2020-05-01 22:57:00,14456,"Yeah look 5 posts up. Lol but no ,may 4 they can prepare to open  meaning   Bring I  employees and  get boats out of dry dock and fix problems with docks and boats but not open to the public till they announce it "
1061193,AKRISONER,2020-05-02 12:00:00,5558,Speculating but I think they realize the financial impact that missing one of the four long weekends in a summer can have on marinas etc. I think dougie wants to give those businesses a break and get them running before the long weekend. im getting tired of working on my boat and not launching it lol...that first tank of gas is gonna be gonnnneeeee lol
1061222,Hack_Fisherman,2020-05-02 23:15:00,720,I heard that Premier Ford has allowed marinas to start preparing for the season. I hope that means public launches are next
1061223,Woodsman,2020-05-02 23:42:00,1286,Unless in a marina or provincial park in most cases the public launches have not been shutdown by the province. That is on the local governments.
1061224,Terry,2020-05-02 23:46:00,14456,I have to believe every boater looking for an open ramp knows that But as  marinas ramps open we all hope the municipalities see the light and open them too
1061225,Woodsman,2020-05-03 00:01:00,1286,Terry I wish you were correct but I see many posts on here and other sites trying to put the blame squarely on the province for all the ramp closures.
1061240,Canuck,2020-05-03 13:26:00,491,"So our marina can prep for launch, but for most of us that do all our own prep, we still can't go to the marina to get things ready.  No way I will let them launch my boat without me being there to make sure its properly prepped, properly tied up, canvas on properly, charger on.  So I will have to wait.  they won't even let me go get my dinghy off the bow so I could at least get on the water with that at the cottage.  Sooooo frustrating"
1061241,Terry,2020-05-03 13:29:00,14456,i think it will change shortly kawarthas plan on opening boat ramps on may 12
1061242,lew,2020-05-03 13:56:00,12766,"Is that all ramps in the Kawarthas Terry, marinas and public  ?"
1061243,Terry,2020-05-03 14:15:00,14456,"It was in a Peterborough news paper Direct quote from the news release.. READ THE LAST SENTENCE.... This is not etched in stone yet.  Mayor Andy Letham says the city is targeting May 12 to reopen boat launches, landfills and open the rail trail to motorized vehicles. The rail trail would usually open around May 1, but will only be open to pedestrian traffic in light of COVID-19.  “These are outside activities. These are local decisions we can make on a local level, but it will depend on the provincial state of emergency and our local state of emergency as well,” Letham said at a media briefing on Thursday (April 23).   The province recently extended its state of emergency to May 12. As that’s the day the declaration could end, that’s the day the city is targeting.  Related Content   COVID-19 will have a 'huge impact' on local economy, says Kawartha Lakes mayor Letham stressed that anything could change between now and then with the pandemic, but he said he wanted to let residents know the city was “working on it.”  “There’s things we can do there to maintain distancing and put some parameters in place,” he said.  “I just want to stress that this is not a done deal. If we can continue on the route that we’re going, we’re on a good path over the next two or three weeks, then we can look at easing some of these things back into the community if we can do it safely.”"
1061245,lew,2020-05-03 15:13:00,12766,Thanks Terry
1061246,misfish,2020-05-03 15:51:00,29133,"Lets hope that smart heads keep this open when it does. We do not need luggans at the launches . They will get shut down real quick . Do not forget,everyone has a cell phone. A quick video and report and well, back to no launching . Myself I do not need one,but this does not mean I do not care for my fellow boat owners that need a launch . I am really looking forward to sitting on my toon in a couple of weeks . I also hope to be back to work in 7 days . I hope I can squeeze in the door .LOL"
1061253,irishfield,2020-05-03 17:24:00,26272,Just talking to my Son across our fence and the OPP called him yesterday and gave him(Communication Director for the twsp) crap for the Victoria Harbour wharf being blocked with cement barriers and the fact they had to help lift the airplane crash victim over said barriers with the paramedics. It was the OPP that requested the barriers be put in place....
1061259,lew,2020-05-03 17:53:00,12766,"^^^^ so what's the big deal if they had to help lift a body, police, fire & paramedics work together all the time."
1061261,BillM,2020-05-03 18:29:00,17367,"I counted a solid 15 trucks pulling bass boats southbound on the 400 yesterday, lol.   I'm sure they weren't getting them out of storage"
1061263,irishfield,2020-05-03 18:57:00,26272,"Apparently the OPP boat guys are a tad out of shape. No clue Lew.. he's been getting threats from all angles, even been called a Nazi..."
1061266,lew,2020-05-03 19:41:00,12766,If those cops actually complained about having to help the paramedics lift a body I'd be very surprised if a formal complaint wasn't submitted. Emergency crews always work as a team.
1059704,irishfield,2020-04-13 21:34:00,26272,18 days... and I don't think he has any plans to cross the border by then either...
1060406,gino,2020-04-21 12:14:00,400,"Hey guys, found this on a FB post. Looks like some ramps are opening. "
1060407,Terry,2020-04-21 12:30:00,14456,Yup I posted the same thing in another thread if closer ones to me don’t open up I will be on the road to open ramps come walleye opener
1060465,FishAbout,2020-04-21 21:29:00,106,Hopefully people only go if they live in the area. Fish alone or with people they live with or I'm sure it will be shut down like many others.
1060481,BillM,2020-04-21 23:06:00,17367,"As soon as a hundred people show up it's going to be closed, lol."
1060582,north560,2020-04-22 21:00:00,38,Up north you may need the skidoo to launch your boat. Lake still making ice.

1060597,irishfield,2020-04-22 22:51:00,26272,Making ice every night this week...
1060621,Garnet,2020-04-23 10:58:00,2056,I sure learning will continue. Everyday the boat is launched something is learned.
1060897,irishfield,2020-04-27 17:04:00,26272,You'll have a hard time launching in Penetang or Midland. Shot I grabbed while we were out doing some essential travel to the banks outer wall deposit slot.   
1060902,misfish,2020-04-27 17:49:00,29133,"No mud on the tires,drive must be nice and dry Wayne . Love dat car bud."

1060917,AKRISONER,2020-04-27 20:30:00,5558,Was announced today that opening parks is part of the first “phase” of covid restriction reduction. So that’s about as good of news as we can get. I think May 2-4 might be the target but I’m just speculating.
1060918,BillM,2020-04-27 20:40:00,17367,"It could be under 1 or 2, clear as mud really."
1060921,John Bacon,2020-04-27 20:54:00,3277,"Going by this, it looks more like Stage 2 to me.  But hopefully it will be in Stage 1. Phase 2: Restart Ontario will take a three-stage approach to loosening emergency measures and reopening the economy: Stage 1: Open select workplaces under modified operations (ex. curb-side pickup and deliveries), allow some small gatherings like funerals Stage 2: Open more workplaces (may include some service industries, office and retail businesses), outdoor spaces, and allow some larger gatherings Stage 3: Further relax the restrictions of public gatherings (large public gatherings like concerts and sporting events still be restricted), opening all workplaces responsibly"
1060929,Pigeontroller,2020-04-27 23:11:00,2793,This is getting to me! I wanna go fishing! Getting to do a burnout in Wayne's roadrunner would help!
1060995,GaraldT,2020-04-29 05:51:00,52,All parks to remain closed until May 31st was just announced last week. Brutal! https://www.ontarioparks.com/covid19
1060998,Bill,2020-04-29 11:25:00,140,I had the opportunity to buy a metallic green one back in the day. I thought the guy wanted too much so I foolishly passed on it.
1061015,irishfield,2020-04-29 15:29:00,26272,You don't want to know what I have in this one.. and my Dad bought it new! Been mine since '79.

1061017,misfish,2020-04-29 15:53:00,29133,"1st step  Is close the boarder to Quebec if they plan on going through with their start up . IMO, it is crazy what they want to do so soon ."
1061018,Terry,2020-04-29 15:55:00,14456,Last I heard it’s how they are going to do it but they have not set a date. So it could be two weeks or two months  or six months
1061045,irishfield,2020-04-29 23:16:00,26272,"Quebec has stated people can start going to their cottages North of Montreal starting May 4th, yet our local Health Board head is petitioning Ford to make it law Ontarians can't go to theirs!"
1059574,captpierre,2020-04-12 17:40:00,2521,Marinas and municipal launches closed for now 😳
1059576,LefroyFisherman,2020-04-12 17:51:00,602,Helicopter?
1059582,BillM,2020-04-12 18:40:00,17367,Beaches always worked when I was a kid.
1059586,Terry,2020-04-12 19:05:00,14456,"You look on google earth  for cottages with their own boat ramps.   Then you drive by to see if they came up from the city if not ,you launch there and park in their driveway the fine for trespassing 80 bucks the fine for launching at a posted ramp 800. Bucks you do the math.  LOL"
1059588,misfish,2020-04-12 19:17:00,29133,"Park where allowed, put toon on shoulders,walk,slip toon into water and row . FISH. Repeat reverse when leaving . Pretty simple to me .  And yes come May opener if they do not close lakes to fishing, I will be performing said above Be well, be safe all ..  I wont be launching here, but you get the point,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LOL Lift and slip,shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  "
1059599,Fisherman,2020-04-12 21:53:00,7201,"You know those steam launchers they use on aircraft carriers,  well don't forget to turn down the pressure a bit otherwise you might make contact with the far shore."
1059602,Gil Levesque,2020-04-12 22:13:00,103,"Dont know how to share a link on my phone,but just read Michigan has banned all powered boats! Yikes!!"
1059605,grimsbylander,2020-04-12 22:21:00,3016,Throw a rake or a lawnmower in the truck and spend a half hour as repayment. You’d probably end up with permission to a private ramp.
1059608,kickingfrog,2020-04-12 23:04:00,8333,I've ordered 2 giant rubber bands and a ramp from ACME.  Most of the ratings were very good but someone with the handle W.E. Coyote only gave it half a star. Photos to follow.

1059637,AKRISONER,2020-04-13 12:12:00,5558,In my yard once the spring mud dries up a bit. Luckily I’ve got the rare gentle sand beach shoreline on Georgia bay! Heck if the water wasn’t so high itd be super easy. Might need to use a couple of sheets of plywood just to keep the tractor from sinking too much!
1059642,misfish,2020-04-13 12:31:00,29133,"IT,S CLOSED It was just to show how easy I can transport my toon ."

1059653,Tjames09,2020-04-13 13:50:00,664,I hope this isn't a serious post....
1059655,porkpie,2020-04-13 14:36:00,2521,"Absolutely, take the lesser ticket every time.  The man knows what he’s talking about.  You’d better put a chain across your ramp...."
1059656,Garnet,2020-04-13 14:39:00,2056,Just reading a Rice Lake Boating Community's Post. States If your address is on the lake you can use launch and take truck trailer home. So nobody in village of Bewdley can launch if they are caught on water. They are not water front. Also anybody that owns a cottage on Rice will not be able to launch because there address will be else where. Sounds like cottage association bull. 
1059658,Terry,2020-04-13 14:55:00,14456,If you have to ask you don’t have the same type of humorist mind as I I thought it was damn funny
1059667,misfish,2020-04-13 16:09:00,29133,"Yup, and I fish with him . LOL"
1059681,grimsbylander,2020-04-13 17:31:00,3016,I bought one...when I pulled the lever the boat stayed and the lake took off.
1059695,BillM,2020-04-13 20:29:00,17367,I'm going fishing with Terry.
1059700,irishfield,2020-04-13 21:03:00,26272,"I thought it was a great plan ! Leah's dumass Father hasn't come back from the USA yet, so you could use his laneway and launch.. directly in from the channel can..."
1059702,Terry,2020-04-13 21:17:00,14456,Dang.  Walleye opener is coming soon. LOL
