1061504,bassman87,2020-05-07 19:50:00,586,i bet theyll do good during the spawn 
1061508,wkrp,2020-05-07 22:50:00,656,They look awfully familiar
1061518,PUMP KNOWS,2020-05-08 03:56:00,937,"I think their website isÂ like amazon, they just pull items from individual sellers. Has anyone ordered anything off their website before?"
1061520,nlpaintballer,2020-05-08 10:49:00,122,"I havent ordered anything, but their prices seem completely out of wack. 200.00 for a plastic boat gas tank compared to 39.99 on CT website. Didnt make sense. The product descriptions are funny too. Do you like fishing? This fishing lure can make you easier to fish. Its bright lustre can attract fish.?It targets fish in upper water, which is perfect for ocean boat fishing, ocean rock fishing, ocean beach fishing and so on. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£"

Â The only problem is that cold water in spring makes that effect only last for the first cast, and then they need to be buffed up again."
1061563,AKRISONER,2020-05-09 14:00:00,5558,Walmart is doing exactly what amazon has done. Youâ€™ll notice that now all items that are available in the United States are now available In canada as well. Same concept of using suppliers to feed their inventory network.  good news for buying boat parts etc. they have a strong automotive parts network as well in the US
