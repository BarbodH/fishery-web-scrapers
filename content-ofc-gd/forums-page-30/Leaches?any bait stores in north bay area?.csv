1061214,OhioFisherman,2020-05-02 19:47:00,6623,https://www.canpages.ca/page/ON/pointe-au-baril-station/e-r-tackle-bait/4095295 you might give this place a call and see what they carry for bait and if they are open for business? I don't know if it is the same place as I dealt with years ago but the old place had a stock tank of leeches.
1061217,cheaptackle,2020-05-02 21:56:00,849,"I don't know if any bait stores are open anywhere - not essential?  Trombly's tackle box up the road from me is shut tight but True Canadian Outdoors near Bass Pro seems to be open, give him (Nick) a shout to see if they have any.  Michael"
1061220,Woodsman,2020-05-02 22:47:00,1286,Hope your looking for future trips. Too early to see leaches in bait shops yet.
1061226,offgriddin,2020-05-03 00:26:00,39,"Yes this is for a future trip.i understand they usually dont start selling till mid may,though I did call a place in Vaughan today who has them maybe it is that true canadian outdoors,that sounds familiar."

1061393,G.mech,2020-05-06 00:47:00,830,Billy Bob's bait just off Hwy 11 on the south edge of North Bay had them last time I was there but it's been a couple of years.  They're on Lakeshore drive just west of 11. 
1061396,AKRISONER,2020-05-06 02:04:00,5558,I think the guy in pointe au baril still carries leaches I just never use em. pretty sure he had them listed up on the board last time I was there in the fall
