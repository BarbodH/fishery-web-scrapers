Loaded up. Then I see this wrapped up thing with just some brass showing. Pick it up,read the tag and say,no way. There is usually a note saying something is missing. I ask the lady if she could cut the tape and wrap so I could look at it. Sure as crap,it,was a Griffon  rotary vise and everything was in the bundle.  One motion jaw for all hook sizes .Reg $200 marked down to $19. I asked no questions. B-Line it to the cash,pay and yelling,start the Ram, start the Ram. LOL  Out with the old  In with the new "

1062070,PUMP KNOWS,2020-05-20 03:09:00,937,Sweet pick up! I wanted to buy my first fly vise.  A few days ago I had the Peak rotary vise in my Cabelas cart and it was on sale for $189 but I just checked now and it’s back to retail at $229 👎 I wonder how that Griffin vise dropped to $19?

1062109,Garnet,2020-05-21 11:12:00,2056,"Your old vise was my step up from Canadian Tire kit vise I started with. $60 from Sail I was ripping it. Couple years I'm thinking stepping up looking at $200-  300 vises. Then a Ganny legend OMJ was selling  fly stuff and part of that was a Renzetti ,what a step up. Just this last year I got the old out and tried using it Mmmm sold it."
