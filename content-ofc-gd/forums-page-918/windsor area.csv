The US side tried stocking programs in the 80's with limited success and a few still get caught in the spring while jigging the Det River for walleyes. The off shore fishing out of the ports of Wheatley and Erieau have unblelievable fisheries but that is done by boats using rigger and dipsey techniques. The Sarnia(60 miles) area has a bit of a run on the St. Clair river. You may want to contact the Blue Water Anglers club to learn more about their area if it works for you, "
