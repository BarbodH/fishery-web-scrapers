287623,walleyemaster,2009-01-04 14:13:00,325,went out sat morning on a lake in huntsville the ice was about 6 inches in some areas and about a foot in other areas..6 inches of snow covered the lake and i could see tracks from a snowmobile that had been on the lake maybe the day before...i got 1 lake trought and a few perch..my flasher was going crazy all day and my buddy jeff was marking fish all day on his finder..the fish were not hungry maybe next weekend...
