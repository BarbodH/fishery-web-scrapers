287559,T Fisher,2009-01-04 04:30:00,139,"Fished the Bog today for slab Crappies and put 33 on the ice from 3:45pm to 6ish. They were on fire for two hours then down to one every 15 minutes. We had a big crack and a bang it sounded like it was just behind us, the ice was making more ice that seemed to spook the fish. We fished in 11 ft of water with green weeds that did the trick as the small perch were in abundance with the odd Walleye hovering on bottom. The fish were taken on 1/8th oz white Crappie jig add a maggot and fish @ 5ft over 11 and fill your bucket.  P. S. of the 33 Crappie 9 were in the 14inch range."

287697,forrest,2009-01-04 18:39:00,1032, When the fish are active during the year I can't think of any other fish that looks as exciting/beautiful as a Crappie leaping out of cover to ambush a bait.  forrest

287740,lookinforwalleye,2009-01-04 21:11:00,4399,  I can`t think of anything more depressing than watching Crappie slurp up Walleye fry in the spring so keep hauling Crappie out of the lake.  Thank-you
287744,jediangler,2009-01-04 21:16:00,1923,"Crappie fight better, by weight, and taste as good or better than walleyes on the dinner table. Congrats on finding a successful pattern and sharing your info with us all    ."
288143,steelhedrmatt,2009-01-05 22:10:00,278, Couldn't have said it better myself.   Keep em all big AND small.  Crappies are the cockroaches of scugog.
