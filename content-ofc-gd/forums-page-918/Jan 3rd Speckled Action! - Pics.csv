We did not get setup until 10:30am and only had 4 bites during the 3.5hrs that we fished. We worked shallow shoreline structure with downed trees with a soft bottom and focussed on the 2 to 4' depths. We caught the fish using small hammered spoons tipped with a piece of worm and still lines with worms. Here is a pic of the the 1st (and largest) fish of the day....it was dang cold in the morning and you can see the ice starting to glaze on the fish within a couple of minutes of catching it.    Guess what is for dinner tonight!.......    Be carefull out there.... although we were on approx. 14"" of ice there were springs near the shore with thin ice or open water..... Greg."
