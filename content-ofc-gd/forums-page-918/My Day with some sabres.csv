286143,blaque,2008-12-31 15:53:00,2419,"Thought id share some of my morning i had this past saturday with Lindy Ruff and a couple of the Sabres. My nephew (and myself lol) were pretty lucky guys this past weekend. The coach for his travel team knows a few people in the sabres organization........and somehow he got Lindy Ruff to coach one of their practices. It was an awesome treat, meeting lindy and a couple other sabres along the way. I even got to sit in a couple of the sabres lockers as we were allowed into the locker rooms as well as sit on the players bench on the ice to watch the practice. Lindy and assitant coach Patrick did drills with the team for an hour and then played against the entire kids team. Lindy, patrick, the goaltender coach, along with my nephews coach played 4 on 20 lol......adults vs. the entire kids team all on the ice at once lol. Lindy and his squad of 4 won lol. This was a day i will remember for the rest of my life as im sure my nephew will as well. Im a die hard sabres fan now for over 30 years........and little jake, hes been one since he could watch them on the tube lol. Anyway, take a look at a few of my giddy moments..........   nephew in pominvilles locker  Ruffs pep talk before practice  film watching station  a few of the lockers  a few more  Me in the leading goal scorers locker (moment of a lifetime, and this is the pic i get!!!!!!!)  view from the bench  Paul Gaustad came out on the bench to watch  Same  I love this one, lilndy decided to show the boys how the one on one drill was gonna go, and picked my nephew to show them what he wanted them to do. My Nephew one on one with the coach of the Buffalo Sabres........Priceless!!!  Drawing out the playbook  The bench  ANother player/coach perspective lol  NEED WATER, Lindy is pushin us hard lol  Coach Ruff and his squad against the kids  Team photo, Lindy Ruff looking down on my nephew  The sabres tunnel, and yes i pretended i was stepping out on the ice for game seven of the stanley cup finals LOL  ANother blurry one, these 3 guys walked past me as i was comin off the bench to the hallway........Drew Stafford, Jaroslov Spacek, and Toni Lydman  Patrick Kaleta with my nephew for the end of the day.  Ill never experience something like this again, i thanked my nephews coaches/and Lindy Ruff immensely for a VERY memorable day. I still cant believe my picture in vaneks locker came out blurry!!!!!!!!!!!! Grrrrrrrr ANyway, i know it aint fishing, and i know it aint the team of choice lol, but  thought id share it as i know hockey is probbaly the second favorite topic here next to fishing lol."
