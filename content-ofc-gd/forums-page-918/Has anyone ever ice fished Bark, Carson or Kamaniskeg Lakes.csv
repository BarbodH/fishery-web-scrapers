I've been to Bark Lake a few years back but the only fish we caught through the ice were Ling!!!  WE fished the lake hard for 2 days and were a bit disappointed..."

There's a parking lot/public launch there to access the lake. Always a bunch of locals with huts out there so you can't miss the spot. There's an open channel of water flowing out into the lake there that doesn't freeze, don't get too close to the edge! The current seems to draw the lakers in there, it was always a hotspot  ."
287675,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-01-04 17:34:00,1362,Thanks for the reply Solopaddler...I'm going to try and plan a Laker and Whitie ice fishing weekend towards the end of February up in that area...
