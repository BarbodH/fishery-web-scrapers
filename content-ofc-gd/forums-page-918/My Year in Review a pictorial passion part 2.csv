A nicely colored up fish for fall     Another scenery shot.    A NY toad usually not this big for sure    Having thanksgiving Monday free and with the weather expected to be mint, I knew this was the last day for greens so off I went, happy I did as I found some really nice fish      Well with some serious steelhead under the belt Great lakes bass were still on the plate….I had 1 final tournament to fish I was going to fish some of the frosty’s but life and steelhead got into the way hopefully next year that’s not the case Anyhow on November 1 off I went across Erie in 5 footers I recall friends were on the water and even they had it rough…note to self the pinkie is still sore and don’t run across Erie in 5 footers in November without gloves ever again………did I say the pinkie is still sore and its 8 weeks later    Didn’t make money but again I met 1 really cool dude that day  Well I finally got the pleasure of meeting someone I had wanted to meet for some time it appears the bass bite got him this year too off we will go, of course with my buddy in tow…I was really hoping we would have a kick butt day and without a shadow of a doubt my friend sure had one hot hand      a nice scenery shot from the morning      And my buddy chillin after a serious fish pound I believe we were in the 50 plus fish for the day    Well in between all of this I finally took a few off and relaxed, the final trip of the year took me full circle to where I started the year on my beloved Credit        I hope next year is just as good I met new people, I fell back in love with bass my wife hasn’t killed me for all the “but I need it” purchases and God granted me  and those I love good health, therefore another year of "" I fish there fore I live""  Thanks for looking"
