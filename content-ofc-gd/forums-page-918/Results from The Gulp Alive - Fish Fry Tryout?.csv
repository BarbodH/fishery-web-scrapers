287830,Leecher,2009-01-05 00:38:00,7832,"Well guys finally gave the Gulp Alive Fish Fry a go today...... The plan was for Paul aka Whitespinnerbait and I to head out to McLaurin bay and try to entice the pannies to take our offerings while watching over our still lines..... temps was @ -8C with no winds, bright and sunny.... Left home at 1:00pm, had to make a detour to get a dozen minnows.... got there at 1:30pm, to our surprise, the Bay was full of anglers and ATV's racing around.... had a hard time deciding were to go.    Met Andrew at the entrance, a local guy that fishes the bay on softwater but never tried hard water before.... very cool guy and knowledgeable  Got to our spot and setup right away and was in 10 to 15 fow.  Rigged 3 of my tipups with live minnows and so did Paul.... Here a pic of mine    Did not take long, got my first perch jigging and just couldn't believe that I would get a strike that soon Here is a pic of it and the rig I was using....    We caught around 15 - 20 of them in a spawn of 2 hours and that's not counting the ones that tried to take the minnows on our tipups  Here is the results of the ones I caught.... nothing big but lots of them                      The big brute that Paul caught    and mine    and Andrew, his first fish on ice ever, WTG Andrew    The pike and bass were no where to be found but manage to catch this guy    Fish fry out numbered the live bait 20 to 2 and I will use it again for sure.... That's stuff is lethal and really works... once fish bites.... it won't let go Andrew and I manage a couple of double headers near the end and that was awesome..... the tipups did get some action but we weren't successfull at landing them, only got our minnows ripped off after setting the hook  Thanks Paul and Andrew for a great couple hours of fishing on ice Was real nice meeting you Andrew and fun watching you get your first fish on hard water Hope you enjoy Until next time Jacques aka Leechman  P.S.  RICH I think I have the answer to your question yesterday.... that stuff really works    Give it a go if you can buy it locally"

287878,Leecher,2009-01-05 02:09:00,7832," Thanks Rich.... I'm sure you'll have a blast with those... report back on your results   Thanks Kev.... You know me, medium size always I forgot to mention the truck that had sunken throught the ice and it's front end sticking out. I should of taken a pic    I think you can see it in the pic with my big perch... there's a couple of ATV's, top righ hand corner, next to my head. We were fishing in the same spot as last week..... there's an ice shack real close now Paul has the minnows and will be freezing them for the whities   Thanks Joco.... I though I'd see you there today since there was a lot of people.  May be next time   Thanks holdfast.... sorry but I can't tell you.... all fish were released today.  They had parasites on them and for that, don't keep'em   Thanks Glen.... That was a lot of fun today trying a new product and seeing results.  The one that Paul caught was the biggest and a handfull"
