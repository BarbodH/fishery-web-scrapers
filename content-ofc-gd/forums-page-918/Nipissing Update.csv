Nipissing has close to 12"" in most areas.  My shack is near deepwater point and I measured 10"" on the first and we are expecting pretty cold weather over the next little while.  I saw a few vehicles on the ice, and the waltontian in is running their bomardier.  I was out for only a few hours but we managed a good bunch of perch, all caught on a live shiner.  I plan on going out again on sunday so I will post another report sunday night.  Again, I hope everyone is well.  Mike"

287402,smbhunter,2009-01-03 22:34:00,186,"Thanks for the update. I'm heading up to Promised Land Camp on the 7th, so I hope the fishing is still good. We had a great time last year and everyone caught some walleye, with an average size of about 3 lbs. We were struggling to get a few keepers. Even managed 3 nice pike, 2 were about 6lbs and 1 was about 10-12. Saw the biggest pike I've ever seen up close, being caught which was about 45"". Lots of herring too. Still haven't caught a whitie on Nipissing, but maybe this year.  I'll post a report when I get back on the 9th."

287414,Bernie,2009-01-03 22:49:00,3190,Good for you getting out there Mike. It was a little cold out there with the wind. Sometimes I find if I am catching perch that I am in too deep of water.
