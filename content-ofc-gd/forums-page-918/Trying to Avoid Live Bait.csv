287228,Greencoachdog,2009-01-03 13:58:00,8163," That should be just right... your presentation must not look natural enough then.  These look good. http://dakotaangler.com/product_info.php?p...1fa5af43b8c77ff  http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http:/...=image&cd=1  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true  .. or you can stick your camera down one hole and empty your tackle box down the other hole, let the fish pic out the lure they like and maybe you can get a glimpse of the one they eat on the camera.   ... but why avoid live bait, you know it catches fish when nothing else will!  There's probably a couple hundred $$$ worth of lure suggestions on this thread, for baits that the fish may or may not bite!  If they don't eat the live bait you know for sure that they aren't hungry!!!"
287234,Spiel,2009-01-03 14:08:00,9065,  ....Sheer genius!
287237,Headhunter,2009-01-03 14:13:00,5703,"Rich, try this... use a Swedish Pimple, remove the hook and use a short lead, three inches tied to a small jig, with a power maggot. Drop it into the mud bottom and stir it up. then lift the rig slightly off the bottom and hold it still. It's a killer set up for Cooks! HH"
287271,DANIMAL,2009-01-03 15:53:00,215,"I have found power bait works better than gulp for panfish, through the ice anyways."
287346,Fishmaster,2009-01-03 19:47:00,920,Why are you trying to stay away from live minows Rich nobody have any up your way ...i don't think i would ever go Ice Fishing without Minnows ...
287348,douG,2009-01-03 19:56:00,2693,"Maybe  you are just not any good at fishing.  That realization has really helped with my lack of fishing success, and anything iced at all is a real bonus.  Hope this hleps."
287363,Cudz,2009-01-03 20:40:00,2652,Gulp fry is crazy.  Works well in the sume set up as a drop shot.  I also drop shot micro tubes.  2 or 3 at a time using 3 different colours. I drop shotted loads for fish through the ice last year with success.
287470,Rich,2009-01-04 01:23:00,3927," That is certainly the case, ice fishing anyway. I get lucky with live bait... which is why I'm trying to improve my skills with other things."
287498,Weeds,2009-01-04 02:40:00,782,"I'm going in the opposite direction to you I guess Rich. As I already know I'm fairly worthless as an angler so I figure this is the year that I'm going to start using minnows; and using them as often as I can catch them. Which probably won't be very often because, as previously stated, I'm a fairly useless fisherman. Kind of a catch 22 I guess.  P.S. Self improvement is the road to ruin."
287503,Greencoachdog,2009-01-04 02:48:00,8163,  ... you must eat a lot of vegetables eh?
287513,Weeds,2009-01-04 03:04:00,782," I have no clue what this means. Good thing, bad thing..........anybody? Should I be eating more vegetables? Should I be eating less? Que Pasa?   Ohhh. Maybe I get it. I don't eat alot of fish perhaps?"
287029,Rich,2009-01-02 19:09:00,3927,"I never thought the day would come when I couldn't get sunfish and perch to take an artificial offering. Been sitting on the same 2 schools of fish the last two days, watching them all day swimming up and turning away.  I've tried Gulp Alive maggots, Gulp waxies, Gulp minnows, tiny hair jigs, flies and tiny spoons. Only thing that got a couple bites was the Gulp Alive minnows, however they were too big (2.5"") and they simply nipped the tail and swam away.  I'm really trying to avoid relying on live bait this ice season, but as the days go by I find myself craving a big ol' bucket of minnows more and more!  Can anybody help?"
287032,steverowbotham,2009-01-02 19:22:00,1800,last year i caught em good just using the tail of the gulp live minnows ... only about a 1/2 inch worth
287036,MCTFisher9120,2009-01-02 19:26:00,3761,"I have these small 1"" crappy tubes that make my little brother happy fishing for sunfish and perch..."
287037,Canuck2fan,2009-01-02 19:31:00,1444,Rich how come you aren't cutting up the gulp to try smaller pieces? I find gulp live worked great until the fish went to school and learnt to avoid it this summer. I just found on smaller waters they caught on to it and it made the fishing tough when that happened. If you are fishing small ponds that might be the problem so change the shape because it sounds like they sure like the scent?
287038,shane,2009-01-02 19:32:00,652,  I only use the front halves.  We should split on a pack.
287039,tipupesox,2009-01-02 19:33:00,167,Purchase some micro tubes in your preferred colors and place them in the same bag as your Berkley Gulp products.  The scent will be absorbed into the micro jigs making them more productive.
287040,ChrisK,2009-01-02 19:33:00,2772,This may be old school but it worked for me when I was more of an avid ice fisherman....Local grocery store frozen section...Frozen squid cut into bite sized strips resembling a minnow...The stuff is rubbery and doesn't fall off easy and the fish seemed to like it....  Cheers !!!
287046,Court R,2009-01-02 19:56:00,213,My bait I use the most on hard water would be the jiggin rap.
287047,bigugli,2009-01-02 19:59:00,6138,"`1"" white or chartreuse twisters only using the tail half."
287049,OhioFisherman,2009-01-02 20:02:00,6623,"I don`t ice fish Rich, but I have used these even in the summer months, never the smallest ones but the bigger one work.  http://www.rapala.com/products/luresdetail...eshorsalt=Fresh  http://www.rapala.com/products/luresdetail...eshorsalt=Fresh"
287051,Rich,2009-01-02 20:09:00,3927,"All great suggestions and I thank you all! And yes I did try cutting the Gulp minnows into smaller pieces, they wouldn't even look at that lol. Will try out the other suggestions though and hopefully I'll have something to report!  Rich"
287054,Mike the Pike,2009-01-02 20:23:00,3421,can you purchase live maggots in your area .You will have to keep them warm though.
287056,Greencoachdog,2009-01-02 20:45:00,8163,"Maybe it isn't your bait, what lb. test line are you using? Braid, mono, or fluoro?  It sounds like the water is pretty clear where you are."
287062,johnnyb,2009-01-02 21:11:00,3413,"How about some flies, or little bug type micro jigs? (Ratso, genz bugs, etc.) See Slayingm's post with the pics of mayfly nymphs...."
287090,Leecher,2009-01-02 22:42:00,7832,"Rich,  I bought the Berkley product ""Gulp Alive fish fry"" with the little jig heads for pan fish and to me seemed to be the right combo to get the pan fish to strike..... I haven't tried them yet but will certainly cut them in halves and give it a go    Another product you may want to try in combination with the fry is the Berkley power paste, in yellow or pink.... it's for trout mainly but dip your jig head hook into the paste, cover it good and don't know why it wouldn't get results.  Hope this helps.... Jacques"
287106,sonny,2009-01-02 23:49:00,511,"Rich also remember that presentation is everything when panfish turn finicky,,,it may be as simple as a horizontal jig rather then vertical,,colour,deadsticking or ripping,,,i love the challenge,,,they will bite but experiment,,,i've had good luck with gulp red wax worms,,,but i really like the looks of that gulp fry!!"
287108,limeyangler,2009-01-02 23:54:00,5204,   I have tried these....THE WHITEFISH LOVED 'EM!   I might be going to a lake that holds perch tomorrow...will try 'em out and report back if i do.
287109,Rich,2009-01-02 23:58:00,3927,"Those Fish Fry things look awesome, hopefully they can live up to their name, I haven't had fresh pannies for quite some time.. haha I'll have to see if I can find them locally.  Have used live maggots and waxies in the past, and they work wonders. No doubt in my mind those bluegills would have lapped them up, but like I said I'm trying to avoid live bait.  And GCD I use 4lb ice line with a 2lb flouro lead .. I certainly hope I don't have to go lighter than that!"
287111,trapshooter,2009-01-03 00:02:00,1234,"Rich, look for the 'ratso' made by custom jigs and spins (I believe).  This is the most lethal panfish jig I've ever used."
287115,Leecher,2009-01-03 00:17:00,7832, Rich forgot to say that I bought them at Walmart and that the juice in the jar does not smell as bad as in the big bucket    you can also get the power maggots and rigged them onto the tear drop jigs like those below in the top right hand corner:    Jacques
287116,glen,2009-01-03 00:20:00,2641,It must be one heck of a tough bite.  Hopefully the fish will turn on and start hitting everything you put down there.  They have to eat sometime.
287122,misfish,2009-01-03 00:36:00,29133,"If you can get ahold of some simcoe bugs Rich,they work very well. I believe Ron has some photos of them."
287164,sonny,2009-01-03 02:42:00,511,"Just went to ct tonight and picked up some of the gulp fry,,,will let you know how they work up at simcoe tomorrow!!"
287173,holdfast,2009-01-03 03:07:00,1813,Small frozen dead Minnows
287199,crappieperchhunter,2009-01-03 04:53:00,2582,Rich my go to bait for perch on Simcoe is #2 sized jigging rap's  tipped with a neon pink power wiggler on the treble.. My fav colours are firetiger and parrot. Also chartruse with the red throat. Haven't used minnows on Simcoe for years.  Good luck at getting bit!!!!
