287597,Dnthmn,2009-01-04 07:17:00,128,Got back from bringing my Mom home a little while ago. She had been at our place for the past week helping us take care of our son because daycare was closed this week and work wasn't. After we got all of her stuff into the house I figured I would round up my ice fishing gear and bring it back to my place so it was on hand.  As I was rounding everything up it hit me that this will be the first time I go fishing since my Dad passed away back in October. Things just aren't going to be the same without him

He passed away in the spring.  I don't get to fish with my son nearly as often as I would like but the times we do are so very precious!  Family isn't great, family is EVERYTHING!"
