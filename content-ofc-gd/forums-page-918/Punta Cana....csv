287665,steve_paul,2009-01-04 17:02:00,658,"G, looking at getting away there in Feb this year and been doing some research.  This guy seems pretty good and is well respected on the DR message boards.  http://www.mikesmarina.info/  I also went out with this fellow when I was in Puerto Plata a couple of years ago, he also does charters out of Punta Cana as well - he had a nice set up and we had a good day out there.  http://www.caribbeanoceanadventures.com/fishing.htm   Also, you can check this site out too - lots of good reviews and a pretty active chat place for info on Punta Cana  http://debsdrtravels.proboards47.com/index.cgi"

Here is where we are staying... we wanted something smaller then the super hotels, all inclusive and somewhat private... we still have access to the larger resorts nearby for the nightlife if we need it..  Fairly newer hotel as well...  http://www.puntacanaprincess.com/  G"

288051,legacey,2009-01-05 18:50:00,127,"Hey Gerritt,  I'm heading to PP next week and staying at the Allegro Resort. I too was interested in looking into a fishing trip and added to a post that can be found here.   http://debsdrtravels.proboards47.com/index...mp;page=1#90392   Just thought maybe some of this may help as well. There's a topic regarding shore fishing contained somewhere on that site too and what to bring or grab from your buffet. Maybe worth while too.  I hope you have a fantastic time.  Cheers,  Paul"

One thing--not sure what package you have--we ended up picking the honeymoon package which included imported drinks on top of domestic--well the bartenders had trouble ""finding"" imported booze (clamato, MGD, smirnof, baileys, etc)--- I found asking them twice to look harder and a couple bucks helped solve the problem for the week.....  The fishing boats are a 15min walk down the beach--and if you deal directly with them you can cut a better deal on the spot rather then going through the hotel..  And if your getting your picture taken with the monkey---make sure to pick a nice one.  I had one nearly tear out my hair!!!  Hit the fondue restaurant and do the shrimp dish---its great..."
