I am looking to fish in the toronto area.........  I know this may seem strange, but I would like to target some of these fish in the spring  thanks!"
287896,fishermccann,2009-01-05 03:25:00,655,For sheapshead the mouth of Duffins creek or in front of the Pickering nuke plant at  any time of year!
287929,danbo,2009-01-05 05:43:00,2646,Most marinas or river-mouths. Ling are rare. A carolina-rig with a dew worm works. Still fishing..bring a chair.

There is a small channel near the foot of Liverpool Road. Those are good spots to try.  If you can travel a bit, towards Hamilton, I suggest going to the Grand River in the Dunnville area, there you can catch some monster channel cats."

One day I had a blast, the other time we went it had rained, the water was dirty and only a few fish were caught.  Well worth the trip, I'm telling you."
288126,bbog,2009-01-05 21:29:00,665,"You'll find Sheephead in Frenchman's Bay but you'll have to put up with the odd small Smallie as well.  Oh yeah, try from shore just past the canoe club and before private property by the channel."
