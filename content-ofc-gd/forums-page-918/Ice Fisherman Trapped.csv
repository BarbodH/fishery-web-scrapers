287272,Terry,2009-01-03 15:53:00,14456,"yeah but if I'm not mistaken you can go on line and find out the schedule of when ships are coming and going  I know they make announcements about when they are coming and going from midland  and my point is if I am fishing a body of water I check on things like that, scary yeas but very irresponsible fishermen I hope they charge them for the cost of rescue"

287576,forrest,2009-01-04 05:02:00,1032,  A ship passing through would be one of the last things on my mind.  Then again I am new to ice fishing.  Mistakes happen. Easy fix.  Setup fishing regs that prohibit fishing until an all clear is made for ship traffic......well I think that is easy.  forrest
