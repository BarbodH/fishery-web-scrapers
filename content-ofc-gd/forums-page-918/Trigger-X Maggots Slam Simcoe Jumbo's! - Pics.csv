286818,Slayingm,2009-01-02 02:31:00,204,"With the cold temps area's of Lake Simcoe have firmed up enough that I was able to get out to some of my favourite Perch grounds off the E. side of the lake.  Normark had just sent me some new samples of their new Trigger-X Pheromone scented plastic baits to try out so I was anxious to see how these new maggots and worms worked.  I rigged up 2 different combinations to try.  One was using the smallest size Blue Fox Lil'Foxee minnow in the custom colour that I designed for them....Chartreuse/White body, orange chin and a white/red tail.  I then impaled one of the Trigger-X maggots onto the hook and dropped it down and started bouncing it off the bottom with frequent pauses.  It wasn't long and 'Bang' the first of many big Jumbo's just slammed the new offering. Here is a shot of the 1st 2 fish I nailed....  I also had one of the Trigger-X mini worms hooked onto the treble of one of my favourite Perch spoons. Although it caught some really nice fish on that it was the Lil'Foxee jigging minnow with the Trigger-X maggot combination (both in Chartreuse and Red) that caught better numbers and especially size.  The biggest fish taken was a 14"" monster with lots of others in the 11 to 13"" range.  Here is a close-up pic of the new scented baits and the jigging minnow that I used.   I caught these fish working the inside turn of a flat in 25'.  When I checked out the stomach contents of the 1st one I cleaned its no wonder the big fish were here...... check out this close-up pic I took.... all their guts will loaded with these .   Happy New Year everyone and see you on the ice.... Greg."

286834,limeyangler,2009-01-02 03:00:00,5204,"Thats really cool, thats exactly the little beasties that the walleye here have been coughing up. I think thats why they have been attacking the split shot on my line and not the minnow. Might have to get me some of those maggots as a backup/go to bait.   Thanks for sharing."

286891,Spiel,2009-01-02 11:49:00,9065, ....Looks to me like mayfly nymphs.

287027,wuchikubo,2009-01-02 18:58:00,1114," Thanks, I looked them up on the net and I believe you're correct. Looks like I'll be tying up some mayfly nymphs and scud flys to kill some time before venturing out onto Lady Simcoe.  Thank you Brian as well.  Stan"
287044,Slayingm,2009-01-02 19:54:00,204,"  Hi Stan,  Spiel is right.... those are all mayfly nymphs and are in the .5 to 1"" size range.... Greg."
