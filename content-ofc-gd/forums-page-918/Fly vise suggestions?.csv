287445,SlowPoke,2009-01-04 00:24:00,2984,"I'm looking for a rotary vise under $100 for dressing trebles. In the future I might want to tie flies but for now I'm more concerned about stuffing big (5/0, 6/0) trebles in the jaws. Any suggestions? New or used is fine. -Brian"

287466,Handlebarz,2009-01-04 01:20:00,3790,Brian Princess Auto clamp on bench vice its big enough but small enough that it will hold the trebles GREAT that is what I use and for the stuff you are doing it will work great I think its only $14-$25.  I think they also have other stuff ya need just dont stay to long and you will be fine
287469,pirlo06,2009-01-04 01:23:00,17,"i bought an awesome rotary vice last year on ebay, if you dont need it right away check out ebay!"

287478,danbo,2009-01-04 01:40:00,2646,How about a Needle-nose Vice-grips to hold the treble hook at the eye. Then clamp the pliers in your workbench-vise.
287519,SlowPoke,2009-01-04 03:12:00,2984,"So far the Danvise is the leading candidate. I looked at an Integra Royale today and it was nice but not a true rotary. Because I'm new at this, I'd like something that won't frustrate me to no end and turn me off tying."
287604,Dnthmn,2009-01-04 08:14:00,128,"Slowpoke,  Let me know if your interested and I'll let you try my vise. It's a Zephyr EZ-Rotary. Retails for $49.99 from a local shop, if they still carry it. The Danvise is actually about $130.00 in Canada. We can meet up for a coffee or a wobbly pop and I'll bring the vice and some tying materials for you to test drive it."
287704,SlowPoke,2009-01-04 18:48:00,2984,  Thanks for the offer! I just ordered a Danvise from Cabela's. I'm not sure I would have if I saw the Zephyr first - that's a nice setup! Perhaps I should have done more homework but I'll keep the Zephyr in mind for my next one LOL. It seems everyone has some backups! -Brian
287716,Dnthmn,2009-01-04 19:29:00,128,Enjoy the Danvise. It is actually a better vise than the zephyr. I have hear it get a few bad review but they were all from people who did not understand how to adjust the jaws properly.  Here is a video that should help you get the most from yours. I hope it proves useful.  http://www.hatches.tv/play.php?vid=339
