287501,forrest,2009-01-04 02:46:00,1032,   GCD was playing coy so I I sent him a picture.  No room for misinterpretation anymore  I think if he video taped it it would be the most watched video on OFC ever.  forrest
287505,Greencoachdog,2009-01-04 02:51:00,8163, So how do y'all get them jet-skis' to run on that volcanic ash y'all have all over the place up there???  Did Mount. St. Helens pop again???
287330,forrest,2009-01-03 19:09:00,1032,So when it comes to ice fishing I do not hear a peep about fishing for bass under the ice.  How come?
287332,kemper,2009-01-03 19:12:00,2232,many (most?) places they are actually out of season.
287333,jwl,2009-01-03 19:12:00,1056, that's easy...most places bass season closes Nov 30 with the exception of a few places way up North that are open all year
287334,johnnyb,2009-01-03 19:13:00,3413,"Yup -- if you go to an american ice-fishing board, you'll hear all kinds of guys talking about bass under the ice....and like the others have said, in Ontario, bass season is only open wwwaaayyy up north"
287335,kemper,2009-01-03 19:16:00,2232,you guys are slow!
287339,Fisherman,2009-01-03 19:21:00,7201,"I think he was TROLLING and got a couple to bite.  If he doesn't know about the seasons, then it's time to read about targeting OOS species."
287340,forrest,2009-01-03 19:25:00,1032,"  Well you thought wrong (or are actually trolling).  As others have stated bass are open in Ontario all year in some areas.  This is an Ontario board.  Here is a link if you do not know about a change to the regs,  Zone 8 has them open (Timmins):  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Newsroom/Lates...NR_E004252.html   thank you to the other guys who posted especially johnnyb who pointed out that it is big in other areas.  I will go a looking to learn about bassies.  forrest"

287356,Cudz,2009-01-03 20:14:00,2652,One of the boys from Gatineau catches them in the winter.  They are open there in the winter.  He has a very cool pic of a smallie through the ice. My question is this: Why doesn't anyone catch oos bass on simcoe by accident.  I don't target them during winter obviously but I have never heard of anyone on simcoe actually catching one. Just wondering if anyone has ever caught one on simcoe through the ice?
287357,Bondar,2009-01-03 20:18:00,817,guys got a couple on scugog on opener that i talked to
287370,codered,2009-01-03 21:09:00,123,I have seen them the odd time fishing for pike in simcoe butt never caught one there threw the ice. During a walleye fishing trip on a very productive lake  I couldnt keep the bass of the line. not catching a walley in 2 days  butt over 15 big bass all over 3 lbs... thats just the way it goes some times... During the same trip there were otters swimming all around the open river mouth  . this may also be a reason the walleye were not around after the weekend I figured we should have tried the other end of the lake ... Do you think that the otters would have an effect on the fishing?
287378,johnnyb,2009-01-03 21:34:00,3413,"Interesting point about the otters...in hindsight, it's always better to have done something different     I've only ever caught smallmouth through the ice; one in Temagami, one in Muskoka, and my lovely wife just pulled a nice one up on Scugog this past week."
287383,Beans,2009-01-03 21:52:00,3339,Joey caught a bugle-mouth bass through the ice on simcoe...  
287390,Leecher,2009-01-03 22:09:00,7832, You are right Cudz.... up here bass season is open all year.... It closes March 31st 2009. Here is my first forrest    And my avatar is also from my first
287394,misfish,2009-01-03 22:14:00,29133,"Funny look,n bass.LOL  "
287397,Terry,2009-01-03 22:19:00,14456,"I have caught lots of bass on simcoe  through the ice  last year I would have caught a bunch, but I could see they were bass on my aquvu and pulled my jig away just before they bite"
287398,Rich,2009-01-03 22:22:00,3927,I've caught them incidentally of course while ice fishing many times for pike. Always thought it would be fun (and easy) if you could legally target them. Would like to travel stateside to do it one day.
287399,Leecher,2009-01-03 22:28:00,7832, Yeah and they sure talk funny too
287407,OhioFisherman,2009-01-03 22:42:00,6623,"Fresh water fish? Walleye, crappie, perch, bluegill,a steelhead? If I was inclined to eat them, and I would have to be stoned broke to have the desire to go out on ice in the cold to catch them.  Season is open here now till March 31st? had buddies that had bass tournaments in december and january as long as the water was open and still got them, takes a pretty good plan? Also know of people getting them thru the ice, but not considered that great of a food fish here by most people."
287416,steverowbotham,2009-01-03 23:03:00,1800," We get em all the time through the ice, but they go right back down the hole.  My g/f got a nice largie today"
287426,misfish,2009-01-03 23:39:00,29133, You stay off of little lake Steve. HAHAHAHA
287427,misfish,2009-01-03 23:40:00,29133," Thats funny,I thought they were speaking french.   J/K my friend.LOL"
287428,Greencoachdog,2009-01-03 23:47:00,8163," Green Trout are waaaaaaay overrated forrest... don't waste your time.   ... go for those 5-9"" Perch like everyone else does!!!        Bass flesh is tough, and only slackards that can't catch any other species eat them!"
287431,bigugli,2009-01-03 23:57:00,6138,Someone forgot to tell the bass the season was closed. Kept getting bass on teardrops tipped with gulp maggots today.
287441,forrest,2009-01-04 00:15:00,1032,Holy cow its raining bass talk!  The Quebec guys seem to have the inside scoop on them.  I hope to get a chance at them this winter (not OOS Bass).  Hey GCD...next time you go to take a snowmobile on a local lake get it on video.  I want to see  forrest
