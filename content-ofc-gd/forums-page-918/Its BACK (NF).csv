286192,hawkeye,2008-12-31 17:20:00,162,Funny when the skin changed(blue looking)  it was back  With the brown theme it's gone
286196,Fisherman,2008-12-31 17:39:00,7201,"Ya, it's a PITA, 2x click with IE, single with F/Fox, just I find F/Fox slower than molasses on some sites."
287669,hawkeye,2009-01-04 17:09:00,162,"No its more wierd than that, as a guest I get the brown skin and 1x clicks. Logged in as a member I get the blue one and 2x clicks.  Just something new to torment the members"
287677,Roy,2009-01-04 17:38:00,13728, Sorry Bud...we really DO try our best. I feel terrible that we put you through that agony. We'll work it out.
287779,Leecher,2009-01-04 22:54:00,7832,I just switched to Firefox last week and that 2x click just disappeared     Just download it and install it.... it's free and a lot faster than IE
