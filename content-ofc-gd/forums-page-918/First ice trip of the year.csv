Headed out this morning and fished Kemp for about a hour. we managed 5 Lakers between the 2 of us between 1.5-8lbs All fish tight on bottom in 105fow on a williams.  ice seemed good, about 4"" of black ice a few cracks here and there. By no means does that speak for the whole lake.   Only had the cellphone sry for the bad pic   Ryan  "
