288106,ScugogBoy,2009-01-05 20:57:00,36,"We did well this past weekend...got our limit of walley on Friday and Sunday (ate the ones from Friday on Sat night)....also had a great time hauling in slab crappies after dark..from 5:00 till about 9:00 pm both nights...they are abundant and bigger than last year....the trick was to find weeds and suspend maggots over 11 feet of water down 5 feet using the smallest ""russian jig/pimple"" you can get your hands on...""glow light-pink"""
288108,mukluk,2009-01-05 21:01:00,196,Atv's and snowmobiles are travelling the western arm of Scugog at least up to Goreskies. Beyond that could be dangerous in spots. Check first.
