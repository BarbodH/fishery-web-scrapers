287588,rbaquial,2009-01-04 06:40:00,968,I got 2 Abu's (C4 & Record) on hand for my attempt at Musky/Pike this coming year/season!
287591,Forester,2009-01-04 06:58:00,46,"CURADO 300 or 301 LH  is a good choice! First, it is lighter; Second, it is more comfort to handle than a calcutta400  size round baitcasting reel."
287791,Radnine,2009-01-04 23:37:00,1538,Perhaps you could make both GCD and Tybo happy by changing the lube in the reel and the lube in your hair
287571,goteeboy,2009-01-04 04:57:00,175,"IMHO, get a used shimano calcutta or a used daiwa luna 300 on ebay. if you're lucky you can get for about 100-150. those reels (especially the calcutta) have been tried and tested for years and are incredibly reliable. you can always upgrade the drag and bearings later too.  the luna was to be daiwa's calcutta killer.  i never had one, but i've only heard good things about it.  my calcutta is 15 yrs old and is still very smooth and those reels only have like 3BBs too.  the tolerances are very tight.  I think the pete maina's are crap...maybe i shouldn't say that...you get what you pay for...it's probably on par w/ the shimano cardiff.  my bro got two cardiffs,  and the quality is shoddy.  personally, i would try to get a round reel that's cold forged aluminum, meaning it's been carved out of a chunk of metal, instead of one that's been molded. the specs are much tighter.  I have an abu c4 too and i love it. i upgraded to a power handle and it's been fine, but my calcutta still casts better. you will pay more but in the long haul its worth it.  for me, i'm keeping my eye out for a 08 or 09 curado 300e. that's supposed to be the best low profile muskie reel. i've got small hands, so it'd suit me.  anyway good luck, happy reel hunting."
