287067,tibbs,2009-01-02 21:31:00,650,"Wow... Great Job!  I still haven't caught anything on the pin i got from you yet.  That's the problem with being only 15, I still have to get my parents to drive me when there not busy.And when there not the river is either blown or gin clear. Oh well, i guess i can wait.  Keep the reports coming!"

287619,Evan Gallimore,2009-01-04 13:36:00,37,Solid report! To bad the American fish fight like french solders!....lol
286715,ehg,2009-01-01 22:31:00,2666,"Wow, that is a ton of fish pictures you posted. Sounds like great timing and the right choice of river for fish.  Good to see you sharing the wealth of experience with those (Bill, Cliff) who have the same enthusiasm.  Thanks for posting report, ehg"
286724,msp,2009-01-01 22:48:00,1336,Looks like you guys had lots of fun. Smiles all around. Any big ones?
286736,centerpin_drift,2009-01-01 23:28:00,94,great report.... makes me wish the rivers in my stomping ground were still open  what kind of rod is that in the first picture posted??
286739,canadian_copper,2009-01-01 23:33:00,925,awsome as usual
286859,douG,2009-01-02 04:46:00,2693,"Mike, Even though the masters (you, BillM and Cliff) slayed'em, I somehow believe that the fish you enjoyed most was the first one that Liam caught.  That was a fabulous grin, one I remember on me a little while ago.  Solopaddler is a true expert in every sense - he will put you on fish, show you how to catch em, and then giggle along side as you hold a beautiful piece of fishy chrome.  Another great report, Mike.  Thanks."
