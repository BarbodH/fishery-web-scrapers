285290,okumasheffield,2008-12-29 22:41:00,318,Just got back from a quick 2-day trip to Windosr yesterday to find out my bathtub drain was clogged up.  It is so bad that there is no vertex or whirlpool on the surface when filled up with water ...  Could not figure out what could cause this since it was working just fine the morning I left  Tried Drain Auger from Home Depot with Drano MaxGel and it didnt work. The entire 8-feet Auger went all the way in and could not dig out anything  Help!

285296,Twocoda,2008-12-29 22:54:00,4130,the clog is probably sitting at 8 feet one inch ..... home hardware carries a snake 25 ' for like 14 bucks....its a hand cranker but it will get the job done...that was last year i had the same clog ....just outta reach ...  good luck
285310,Jigger,2008-12-29 23:13:00,1237,Plunger... Funny word when you write it. Does the toilet drain properly? Sink? You may just have alot of hair and crap built up in the bathtub strainer. Pop-up strainers collect a ton of stuff in bathtubs and should be checked every now and again...
285341,fishing,2008-12-30 00:06:00,167,"I had the same problem a week ago. Go to Canadian Tire, they sell a sort of liquid in a jar for it. Takes only 20 or 30 minutes. Costs about 4 or 5 dollars. Sodium hydroxide in the solution will clear the hair and fibres for you. Good luck."
285374,OhioFisherman,2008-12-30 00:57:00,6623,"Is anything else on the same pipe? My downstairs shower and kitchen sink use the same pipe to drain. Shower was slow draining and so was the kitchen sink, ran a snake (25 foot) thru to thr junction and didn`t really feel any blockage, then I put a couple cable ties on the end of the snake, cut them short like 3/4 inch and ran it thru.  Ran hot water into the sink and let it fill, it all backed up in the shower, grease build up, ran the snake thru again and it was all gone. Left the hot water run in the sink while I was doing it."
285384,sturgman,2008-12-30 01:05:00,249,"Not sure if this has been mentioned thus far, although if you are running a septic system and other drains in your house are sluggish also. You may only need to have your tank emptied. A tell tale sign your septic tank is full. Good Luck!!"
285403,nancur373,2008-12-30 01:45:00,1211,"I work in the business for a municipality. We do only municipal repairs but we investigate every call. If I have one piece of solid advice I have to give, it is to not call any company with the word ROOTER in it. Seen way too many botched jobs and people been taken advantaged of. If you have a septic tank make sure the chemical is safe for it. You can rent longer snakes at Home Depot for cheaper than buying. If you can't get it cleared call a plumber who has done fair work for someone you know.  Curt"
285474,okumasheffield,2008-12-30 03:40:00,318,I have checked all sinks & drains and they are all ok except the bathtub.  Are there other reasons to cause the clog in such a fast manner?  Going to try the 25 ft auger tomorrow
285488,Twocoda,2008-12-30 04:45:00,4130,yes thre are but it would be rude to say on a forum board ....so just a little advice....pick up a pair of latex gloves....
285638,shane,2008-12-30 16:57:00,652,"So?  Are you flowing yet?  Living in my own version of 'This Old Freakin' House',  drainage problems are pretty common around here so I find this interesting.  If you have access to the drain pipe in the basement or something, you could try running hot water into the bath-tub and then feeling the drain pipe with your hand at different spots and you might be able to find where the clog is.  Good luck."
285684,troutologist,2008-12-30 18:27:00,951,"Clear Line from home hardware it comes in a bottle in a sealed plastic bag. Never fails, just cut the top off a water bottle to use as a funnel as it my discolour your drain.  It stinks but works!"
285699,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-12-30 18:47:00,1362,Are you on a septic tank system or city sewer??
285714,Dano,2008-12-30 19:19:00,719,"Not trying to be a smart a s s here, but by the time you finish messing around with it, you would probably save money by calling a plumber, its what we do."
285807,Guest steel'n'esox,2008-12-30 23:01:00,0,"There is a product called clearline, it comes in a 1litre bottle and the product is a red liquid. I was told at a cash an carry plumbing shop to try thios if it does not work call a plumber, it hasnt failed me yet. wear rubber gloves and read the instructions carefully before using good luck"
285834,Daplumma,2008-12-30 23:32:00,1961,"That should do the trick,most tub drain lines are fairly short. Joe"
