287833,JeffBornFishin,2009-01-05 00:40:00,260,Won't be travelling anywhere tonight.  Got a heavy coat of freezing rain.  It is currently coming down heavy again.
287851,ccmtcanada,2009-01-05 00:59:00,7971,"Lasted about half an hour here.  Side street are a mess, but previously treated surfaces it's just wet.  401 is just fine thru Toronto and Durham.  Be careful...off and on ramps could be ugly!!"
287919,irishfield,2009-01-05 04:57:00,26272,Won't be travelling anywhere my   !! Wasn't fun I'll tell  ya... large rain drops freezing instantly on the windshield with FULL heat/fan on and only way to keep it partially clean was to keep pumping the winshield cleaner fluid to it (2 full jugs used today). Outside temp was -8C.... Conditions were this way all the way from just West of Kingston to Bowmanville... then again for most of the ride up the 400 just a few minutes ago.  Left Ottawa at 3:30.. just got home at 11:30. Lots of cars went off roading... and the worst are the middle lane... 40KPH with the 4 ways on.

287925,bigugli,2009-01-05 05:17:00,6138,I guess we missed it here in Beamsville. The heavy clouds moved in but did nothing.
287926,jwl,2009-01-05 05:21:00,1056,"just a drizzle here, enough to coat the driveway and vehicles a bit, I just went to check it out a second ago because I have plans to go on a mission down the Gorge in the morning and when I opened the side door, I scared the crap out of a big possum that scared the crap out of me when I opened the door and there was this hissing sound and gnarly looking teeth at my feet almost getting into the house"
