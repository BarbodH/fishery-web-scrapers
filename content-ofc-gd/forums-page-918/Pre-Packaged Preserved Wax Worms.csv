I don't want to go home skunked 3 times fishing perch and sunfish. lol  I bought some of the pre-packaged preserved waxies from CTC. Figured it's worth a try. Anyone else tried them? Are they as good as live stuff, or even close?"
287901,charlied,2009-01-05 03:43:00,584,I i tried them and they didn't work very well for me
287907,lickmyarmpit,2009-01-05 04:09:00,359,I tried them today and it was the old skunkaroo here too.
287976,xeon,2009-01-05 14:11:00,350,Ya I bought some too during the early season. They smell like alcohol. They were obviously designed to attract the fisherman not the fish.
