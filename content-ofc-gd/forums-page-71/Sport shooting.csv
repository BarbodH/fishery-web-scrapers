1022967,Dutch01,2018-02-15 15:21:00,1431,"So yeah, I helped get the other topic locked down (with a little help from my friends so to speak). Rules are rules, and I opposed the no political thread ruling at first, but now I think it's best for the community. I thought since I may have given some of you the impression I am ""anti-gun"" I would point out that I greatly enjoy target shooting, and I even shoot an AR sometimes. Here's a couple pics of my 14 year old Son and I shooting at the range. I am glad he's been taught proper gun handling and safety. I believe having used therm he will not have curiosity about guns and will be safer if he sees one (at a party, from a friend, whatever). It's a good pastime (although expensive!). Post a pic of yours if you like.   "
1022979,Pigeontroller,2018-02-15 17:51:00,2793,I really hope your Son never 'sees' a gun at a party.
1022981,Dutch01,2018-02-15 18:26:00,1431,I hope so too. But I'm not going to be naive. I saw more than a few street guns in my teens. He's smarter than I am so hopefully you're right.
1022982,DRIFTER_016,2018-02-15 18:26:00,10439,Big fan of trap and sporting clays myself. Sadly there is none up here in Yellowknife. Used to belong to the Sydenham Sportsmen's club and shot competitively. Was way too much fun.
1022984,Dutch01,2018-02-15 18:30:00,1431,"My gf shoots clays sometimes at the Galt Sportsman's Club and seems to enjoy it. I'm shooting a friend's guns at his home range in those pics. I'll get my own someday but right now not in the budget, sadly. I'm surprised there isn't a place up there for you to shoot clays. Seems like there'd be lots of interest..."
1022996,DRIFTER_016,2018-02-15 21:12:00,10439,Mostly rifle and some pistol at the gun club here. :'( 
1023027,vance,2018-02-16 03:55:00,719,"There is nothing wrong with knowing about guns. My dad was a 30 year vet with the Canadian army ,he was a Master Armourer and had the keys to the gun ranges and armouries. He was also the District Commissioner for the Boy Scouts and we scouts spent many a saturday on the gun ranges with the STRICTNESS OF SUPERVISON that you can imagine having fun firering a wide range of weapons. We all realized what a gun could do as many of our fathers had bullet scars in them and these party guys have no idea what a bullet will do to a human body...  vance"
1023067,aplumma,2018-02-16 23:52:00,6896,I think a shooting range is an excellent place to go and practice. We have 3 in the area that cater to all forms of shooting with one that has a  300 yd range for the big caliber guns. The cost for a membership varies one is $200.00 and the big caliber is $600.00 which has quite a few more amenities. I have enough land here to have a really nice pistol range that we can shoot up to 50 yards for sighting in rifles. All in all it makes for a good time for a group of us to go out back and shoot different weapons that we own. Art
1023070,Dutch01,2018-02-17 00:31:00,1431,"It's a lot of fun, even just as a guest. I think that range is about $700 a year, which isn't crazy at all really. Hard to fit in the budget though when I'm selling my boat because it's costing me that much a year in storage (and also because I'd like my kayak better!). If I had some land I'd do the same as you for sure."
1023074,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-17 01:50:00,8243,We would throw clay pigeons out over the lake until I got a visit from our local OPP. And they didn't leave until they took a few shots too.
1023076,Dutch01,2018-02-17 03:02:00,1431,Neighbors must have loved that!!!
1023078,lew,2018-02-17 11:53:00,12766,My daughter has never touched a gun in her life but today is her birthday and she wanted to go to a shooting range and fire guns for the 1st time ever so that's what they're doing. I don't know where they're going but it's an hour from Mississauga 
1023088,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-17 18:43:00,8243,It was the dead of winter. No one close.
1023090,Dutch01,2018-02-17 19:10:00,1431,I live in an apartment building in (near) Toronto so the idea of having no one around half the year sounds like heaven to me....
1023126,motv8tr,2018-02-18 18:48:00,2587,"I'm scheduled to take the gun course next month with a couple of co-workers.  After that I'm hoping to join the club in Barrie, I haven't shot often but enjoy the challenge of target shooting and hope to do more of it in the future. Maureen"
