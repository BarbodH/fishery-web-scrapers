1023093,Musky Plug,2018-02-17 21:38:00,398,"Drove by today, was at least a dozen huts out in the bay and half a dozen more in the bayfront park channel."
1023094,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-17 23:32:00,8243,"Fish Farmer, it wasn't I that ratted out. Old time OG Hamilton guys don't do that. Especially east enders."
1023096,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-17 23:39:00,8243,"That doesn't include everything from the Coke Oven By-Products dumped in there pre 1981. We made chemical weapons from the stuff for US and British forces for use in WW1 to give everyone an idea what is in there. When there was no longer a market for things like Mustard Gas it was just dumped into the Burlington Bay.  Including every one of the designated substances known to cause Cancer and many other birth defects in children. There will be those that will eat each and every single fish caught. No doubt in my mind, no doubt whatsoever. Idiots all."
1023097,G.mech,2018-02-17 23:50:00,830,"HInt; if the walleye look like this, throw them back.  They are hard to clean and quite bony.  "
1023099,Fish Farmer,2018-02-18 00:31:00,2234,"Saw that picture on another site Gmech, If you look closer a smaller fish is shoved under the gill plate. But hay have seen some scary looking fish before, like this Walleye we caught at Quinte few years back. They told us it's still ok to eat, Id want to see that person sit down and eat it. But your picture looks convincing just the same."
1023100,Fish Farmer,2018-02-18 00:39:00,2234,"I know Johnny, was a few on social media and the article in the spec etc. Was bound to get out anyway John, I hope they can nip it in the but and get the low limit introduced."
1023104,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-18 02:36:00,8243,Agreed 110%. It isn't a big body of water. It could easily be fished out even if it is all catch and release if what I read about the mortality rate of C&R of Walleye is close to accurate.
1023107,John Bacon,2018-02-18 03:08:00,3277,"If the MNR keeps stocking new fish to replace the ones that people eat, that may help remove some of the contaminants from the bay..."
1023108,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-18 03:26:00,8243,"OK you go first John. Hopefully some day it will be safe, I really hope so. I won't feel as guilty then. If you told me 20 years ago there would be Walleye in that cesspool I would call you crazy, so who knows? I fell in the East Side Lagoon that drained into the bay when I was a 16 year old HS kid working for a contractor after school. I was standing on the stuff for a few seconds before I went under. They sent me to the Stelco medical and gave me a shot of something and went back to work soaking wet. The things we had to do for 3 bucks an hour in grade 10 was insane. Good money then I tell ya. If today my parents would be reported to Child Protective Services. 16 freekin years old. I did buy a brand new car in grade 12 though. Best car in the teachers parking lot!!"
1022853,the spirit of fishing,2018-02-14 14:48:00,141,Just saw this in the Toronto Star . Thought GTA folks might be interested. https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/02/13/hamilton-harbour-turning-into-sport-fishing-haven-with-return-of-walleye.html
1022854,Dutch01,2018-02-14 14:53:00,1431,"Great read, thanks. Being in Markham I can't see myself making the trek to the Hammer, but for guys that live out there this is great news."
1022855,Acountdeleted,2018-02-14 14:55:00,2562,Those were all the walleye they released in the Toronto Harbour last year. They needed somewhere to run and BoQ was too far.
1022900,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-14 21:55:00,8243,"I wonder if there is a warning as for consumption of those Burlington Bay Walleye and Perch? I don't know when they changed the name to Hamilton Harbour, it was called Burlington Bay back when we were kids. Those Pics were not too smart to go to Hamilton. Oh wait, like many from TO maybe they are taking advantage of the cheap housing. Maybe smart after all."
1022902,misfish,2018-02-14 22:40:00,29133,Some people will eat anything and I sure it will get heavily fished now.
1022919,G.mech,2018-02-15 00:47:00,830,"Just for giggles I looked this up in the history books and the name was officially changed in 1919.   So how old does that make you OI 110 years or so???   In all reality though, I remember it being called Burlington Bay by the locals when I was a kid and that was in the 70's.  I guess they never got the e-mail."
1022926,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-15 02:02:00,8243,"You didn't believe me G.? I wouldn't embellish or make something up. Man I'm older but not that old, but our text books must have been and that's what everyone called it, I still do. I went to Bartonville School that was on Kenilworth South, it was 100 years old when I went to Kindergarten in 1958. Wow I am old. Burlington Bay has been cleaned up but not enough for me to eat from it. I worked next to it for 30 years and know what was dumped in it. Reduce pollution though dilution. Google Randle Reef, one of the hottest spots in the entire World. A few years ago I was sworn to secrecy by one of our members here as they were catching Pics through the ice. No secret now."
1022961,Mike Pike,2018-02-15 14:50:00,1332,"I think the walleye fishery will be safe in the harbour.  Of course, some people will consume the fish, but I'm betting the vast majority won't.  Also, it's not a shore fishery so most will need a boat to fish walleye. I believe eating fish out of the harbour is a big mistake.  The toxic Randle Reef, especially now that's it's being disturbed as it's being capped, as well as the old Woodward water treatment plant spewing into the contained harbour and toxic algea bloom every summer are just a few of the reasons. Also, people who choose to windsurf in the harbour do so at their own risk, me thinks."
1022962,Dutch01,2018-02-15 14:51:00,1431,"Does anyone know if the walleye stay in there all summer, or do they go out the main lake?"
1022965,AKRISONER,2018-02-15 15:07:00,5558,"my guess is that you would have a mix of both resident and migrating fish...at least in my personal experience, there are always straggler fish that seem to like their digs where they spawn and never leave."
1022966,Dutch01,2018-02-15 15:12:00,1431,"You're probably right. I was just thinking if it gets warm enough for am algae bloom, I'd be surprised the walleye would want to be in there during summer."
1022994,Musky Plug,2018-02-15 21:07:00,398,"This was my exact thought when I read the article.  It was nice to go out there and see one, or two boats max fishing.  IMO most stay and those that do leave the bay probably may never return. The bay is pretty deep, somewheres around 70-80ft if I'm not mistaken, maybe they wouldn't be affected by the algae bloom?"
1022999,Dutch01,2018-02-15 22:00:00,1431,Good point - I didn't realize it was that deep.
1023003,Acountdeleted,2018-02-15 23:13:00,2562,Navionics shows 20-30. I was trying to figure out where to fish it.
1023005,Rizzo,2018-02-15 23:25:00,4754,Nice to see
1023006,woodenboater,2018-02-15 23:27:00,2277,Hamilton Harbour gonna get hammered. heavily
1023012,Musky Plug,2018-02-16 00:07:00,398,"I'm not sure where you're looking, but the main basin of the bay is drops to about that depth."
1023021,Fish Farmer,2018-02-16 00:51:00,2234,"I Ice fished today close to shore behind Leander and was 41 FOW. theres spots that are almost 90 FOW Eating fish out of the harbor your taking a chance. With all the pharmaceuticals dumped in the harbor from the out of date sewage treatment plants in Dundas and Hamiltons Woodward plant Windamier basin, beware. Estrogen, Steroids, Birth Control, etc. are just a few that they mentioned in the Spectator dumped every day in the harbor. The Pike in the harbor do not produce because they found they had both female and male hormones. We've been catching these Walleye for awhile now but I release all. Few of us have been keeping it quiet worrying about being over harvested. They have to introduce some sort of 1 fish limit or slot, or the Walleye and other fish will be fished out. The fish safe eating guide book the they put out says they are safe to eat but they only check for PCBs, Mirex, Mercury. Not pharmaceuticals. So if you want to take a chance eating fish from the harbor, go for it. Near future you might have to sit down to pee.    "
1023022,Acountdeleted,2018-02-16 02:23:00,2562, Ah crud. I was looking west of the 403 for some reason.
1023029,smitty55,2018-02-16 04:06:00,928,"Yep, lots of water out there.  "
1023035,chris.brock,2018-02-16 14:01:00,4053,"There's depths to 80 feet (or more). If you drive down York Blvd and look out, you'll see where the guys are fishing. I think the water quality in the Harbor is ok now but the sediment is still heavily contaminated. I wouldn't eat anything from there."
1023036,Jon,2018-02-16 14:16:00,209,Here is a Master's thesis on walleye movement in the harbour. See Chapter 3. Walleye Movemement in Hamilton Harbour  Jon
1023071,Fish Farmer,2018-02-17 01:01:00,2234,Thanks for posting Jon
1023072,Fish Farmer,2018-02-17 01:07:00,2234,That white area is a dead zone no oxygen. High concentration of ammonia. Was told no fish will live in that area
1023092,Fish Farmer,2018-02-17 20:29:00,2234,Don't forget the regs state same rules as Quinte slot limit on the Hamilton Harbor
