1022684,OhioFisherman,2018-02-12 01:55:00,6623,"I used to use some very big minnows here for bait, also in PAB, one of the problems I had was the mono would sink after they swam around a while and leave me guessing if I had enough slack in for a good hook set. http://www.gink.com/GG-Products-StreamSide-Gink.html  That stuff had no problems keeping my 17 - 20# test mono floating, it may work on braid or flouro?"
1022685,Tom S,2018-02-12 01:57:00,362,"Yep. Can't stand it, hard to tie, hard to cut, kinks. Rio product is much better."
1022686,OhioFisherman,2018-02-12 02:07:00,6623,"http://www.lurepartsonline.com/Online-Store/Leader-Wire/Twist-Weld-Spool.html I have also used this before, it comes in some light sizes ( diameter ). No need for crimps."
1022767,kickingfrog,2018-02-13 01:04:00,8333,"I use that if I'm walleye fishing and pike are heavily in the mix, but for topwaters it would be heavier than flouro and, I'd think, less stretch."
1022778,chong,2018-02-13 02:41:00,102,i would use 20lb which would be the same as 30lb fluoro.
1021387,chong,2018-01-19 19:50:00,102,"Do any of you use a leader for frogging? Last summer i lost 5 frogs in one day because of pikes cutting my line,i'm using 40lb braid. I'm thinking of using a 6"" titanum leader."
1021388,BillM,2018-01-19 20:55:00,17367,"Nope, braid right to the frog.   Frogs aren't something I like to throw in pike territory because of exactly that.   You could try some thick mono  leader maybe?  40lb or so?   At least it wouldn't pull the frog down in the pockets like flouro or titanium would."
1021389,AKRISONER,2018-01-19 21:15:00,5558,heavy mono would be your only option...honestly ive spent a lot of time working with mono and fluro to find that sweet spot where the majority of the time pike wont cut it and 18lbish seems to be the sweet spot. The majority of the time if the line is fresh they dont cut it.
1021405,MJIG,2018-01-20 00:15:00,227,"Several years back, when I used a type of hollow plastic frog that had life-like legs out the back, pike would repeatedly take the back legs off completely with their initial chomp and/or puncture the plastic so that it would fill up with water. I went through 5 in one afternoon and gave up on the tactic of using those things in pike waters. We were after largemouth at the time. I would rather have lost the entire thing, I think.   "
1021409,chong,2018-01-20 01:17:00,102,"What brand mono would be good? I don'think a 6"" titanium leader would be heavy enough to pull the frog down. MJIG  fishing hollow belly frog are exciting and gives me a rush eveytime there is a blow up, that's why i like frogging. This is the other reason , a  22""er.  "
1021410,chong,2018-01-20 01:22:00,102,"what about this, has anyone used it before?  "
1021414,kickingfrog,2018-01-20 02:13:00,8333,"I've used flouro, mono and tied direct. For me the sinking of the flouro isn't much of an issue since I usually have all the line off the water. I do prefer to have something down there but more so for the stretch than the pike teeth."
1021428,buick14,2018-01-20 11:40:00,741,"Yes it works  well, and you don’t need to use a lot. Just watch your hands as it always finds a way to sting me every time (it’s seriouslysharp )"
1021431,DropShot'r,2018-01-20 13:11:00,62,"Several years  ago I was going through the same problems. I experimented with 25 & 40lb fluorocarbon leader material. Although stiff, one could still tie good knots with the 25lb fluoro. I found the 40lb so stiff it was impossible to tie proper knots with., it was almost like trying to tie a knot with a wire coat hanger....LOL If you want to pursue the fluoro leader option I would suggest crimping the leader. I use 65lb braid  for froggin'.  I do use a 2ft. leader of 65lb braid just for reducing abrasion on the main line.  You could also tie a small Spider Hitch with your braid then you would have a double line attached to your frog. I cut my bite-offs  dramatically by switching to LiveTarget from Spro, and I stopped trimming my tails. I suspect the longer tails had more to do with this than the brand of frog.  Good luck, Drop"
1021433,scuro2,2018-01-20 15:24:00,904,Assuming the biggest pike you might ever see is a 40 incher I'd go minimum 80 pound fluoro. If there are no big pike in that lake smaller.
1021435,aws,2018-01-20 15:28:00,53,steel leaders.
1021438,wallyboss,2018-01-20 18:12:00,1095,Make sure It's not because of a bad knot on your braid. Had a buddy a few years ago blaming his 4th lost frog to pike's. Until I watched him make his knot. Use a Palomar. Most other regular knots will slip especially with bigger braided line.
1021450,chong,2018-01-20 21:30:00,102,"i'm sure it's not the knot, when i go to set the hook and there's no tension ,the line comes flying back limp you know it's a pike"
1021474,AKRISONER,2018-01-21 14:09:00,5558,The reason Bill and I recommend mono is because steel and fluro don’t float and that can mess up the action on your top water
1021497,Tom S,2018-01-21 18:43:00,362,Has anyone tried the knot-able wire available for fly fishing toothy critters? I have a Rio spool that I was quite impressed with this summer. Easy to work with and not to heavy
1021501,kickingfrog,2018-01-21 19:25:00,8333,I use tie-able wire for jigging when the pike are common but since I've haven't had a problem with pike in my frog spots I haven't tried it. I guess the lack of stretch compared to mono/flouro would be a possible issue.
1021541,AKRISONER,2018-01-22 00:58:00,5558,"started using this stuff always when fly fishing on gbay because I cant afford to lose $15 streamers, and specifically when targeting pike in the spring...you cant beat it. Jesus its expensive though lol."
1021544,chong,2018-01-22 01:48:00,102,"i found this video, what do you think? will doubling the line help ? "
1021546,kickingfrog,2018-01-22 02:17:00,8333,"Interesting knot. I'll play around with it. He says it's x4 but that doesn't mean much for getting cut. The issue isn't so much breaking, but getting bit off."
1021675,msp,2018-01-24 00:52:00,1336,Just go straight braid. 65 pound. buy some extra frogs just in case
1021703,AKRISONER,2018-01-24 13:06:00,5558,"Lol try tie this when its -10 with 50kmh winds. No sense in doubling line, just go with a heavier lead?"
1021706,BillM,2018-01-24 14:04:00,17367,Who tossing frogs at -10 with 50km/h winds?  lol
1021707,AKRISONER,2018-01-24 14:07:00,5558,lol you never know here in Ontario what can happen  Could be one of those mornings where you go out in a parka and finish in a bathing suit.
1021715,Lape0019,2018-01-24 15:04:00,647,"I don't believe in leader materials for frogging. No matter how much the leader (flouro or metal), it will mess with the action of the frog in some way shape or form. I have used 65lb braid for years and can maybe think of two times where I have lost a frog. Am I lucky? maybe.. but I very rarely use leaders on anything and have not lost many lures."
1022682,chong,2018-02-12 01:24:00,102,"what  about this , anyone tried it?   "
