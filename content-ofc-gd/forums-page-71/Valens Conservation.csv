1022718,bassinator,2018-02-12 15:45:00,32,Hi All...has anyone fished Valens before. Heading up there in a few weeks and any info on where to start looking for crappies would be appreciated. I was told the max depth on the lake is around 14ft. Any info or insight would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks Jeff

It's been a Long Long Time Since I went ice Fishing (Sometime around 1999-2000 I guess, when I was about 10-11 Years Old), We Have no Gear for ice Fishing though I got a $20 Canadian Tire Gift Card for Christmas that I could use to get a Cheap Ice Fishing Rod/Reel Combo unless a normal Kids/Youth Rod would be OK, we might have 1 or 2 of those around that my Nieces could use if they decide to give it a try instead of skating. https://conservationhamilton.ca/valens-lake/ http://www.ontariofamilyfishing.com/events/anuual-ice-fishing-derby/"
