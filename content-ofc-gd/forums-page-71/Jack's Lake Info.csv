I know squat about the lake and am wondering if anyone here knows anything about it? We would prefer a lake that isn't a nut house in the summer and we would also like an opportunity to catch a few fish. Is this place a zoo in July and has anyone had any decent luck in it? We have a group of ten people which is making our search a challenge... any suggestions are welcome. We are willing to drive what it takes, within reason... HH"
1022020,FishFinder17,2018-01-29 15:59:00,139,Have a buddy who has a cottage there. Have never fished it myself but there are some monster Muskie on that lake. I believe it also has a healthy walleye population and even lake trout as parts of that lake are 150ft+ deep.

Its landlocked, so you won't have the traffic of the kawartha's, but still has lots of cottagers etc.....no busier than anywhere else will be then. I have a buddy with a place there and we always have a great time there. Let me know when your around and we can set up a jam session, its only 45 mins from my place lol  S."
1022029,Headhunter,2018-01-29 16:49:00,5703,"Thanks Shane! I doubt I'll be bringing any guitars up! We are looking at an island cottage, so we'll be boating in. I'll let you know once we have things figured out. HH"

1023147,tomkat,2018-02-18 23:36:00,246,Beautiful lake. Fished it a few times with little success for Muskie but lots of bass. Watch out for shoals lots of depth variation
