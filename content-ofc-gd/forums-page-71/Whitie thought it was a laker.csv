YAMADOOO MAN.  Plan was to hit a ""SPOT"" we do well down riggin. We get all set and WOW, the water is brown. Hard to mark a small jig past 90 fow. Gave it a go for a couple of hours, but fish that came in, never seen the bait. Move back in to a 115 ""SPOT"". WOW, it,s clean water. WTH. Started marking fish, and the, chase my bait game started. Up down, up down. No takers. Lunch time. Ah yes. Nothing like a couple of cheese dogs to fill a hunger. Leave the blade bait dead stick. Up one comes to 90. This fish was streaking. Laker on the move. Gets 1ft from the bait and I start reeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Lets start from the beginning again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ;D "

1022638,ketchenany,2018-02-10 23:30:00,3229,Looks good bud. You are getting to be quite a filmmaker! I see Oscar in the short fish category. The whitefish won’tvbe Happy when it sees the oil and batter.
1022640,huzzsaba,2018-02-10 23:42:00,884,Great Video as usual! Was out yesterday with the family for some perch fishing on cooks bay and the water was brownish color. Wonder if a glow jig or spoon helps in these conditions?
