1022734,Acountdeleted,2018-02-12 19:50:00,2562,"Hey everyone,  Just noticed one of my favourite lakes to ice fish changed its regs for 2018.  The new regs are 'No fishing from Jan 1 to fri before family day (Ontario). Does this mean you can start fishing the lake on the Friday or did I take a day off for nothing and have to push my fishing adventure back a day?  Thanks."
1022739,Sinker,2018-02-12 20:40:00,8692,Its pretty clear in writing.  Closed Jan. 1st TO the friday before family day.  Season opens saturday at 12:00:01 am.  S.  
1022740,misfish,2018-02-12 20:57:00,29133,"Yup, thats how I read it as well."
1022743,Acountdeleted,2018-02-12 21:13:00,2562,Crap. Thanks.  Was hoping To Friday meant To Friday at 12:01am.
1022752,BillM,2018-02-12 22:38:00,17367,"So it opens two days later then last year, lol."
1022754,SirCranksalot,2018-02-12 22:41:00,3291,"Why don't they just nail it down to Feb 10, say, so that it's always open on Fam Day? "
1022756,Acountdeleted,2018-02-12 22:58:00,2562,I’m just grouchy because I thought booking the day off meant there would be little pressure at my spot. Now I gotta get there at 4am.
1022758,G.mech,2018-02-12 23:38:00,830,"It is, The season is closed up to and including the Friday before Family Day each year according the OP..... Just for clarity on Page 8 of the regs and above each zone's season dates it states: So it says the season is closed until the Friday meaning Friday is 'Closed'.   With that said, I can't see any lake in the table or the exceptions that re-open before family day, most are the 3rd Friday in May....what lake are we looking at??"
1022772,Sinker,2018-02-13 02:09:00,8692,Um...read the title.  For many many years joe opened on feb 15th. They changed it when family day weekend was before the 15th and people omplained. Should have just left it the 15th.
1022775,G.mech,2018-02-13 02:27:00,830,"Thanks for that, I read the title and read the exceptions in the Zone 15 regs and can't see it.....what am I missing??? https://files.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/fishing/2018/2018-fmz-15-english.pdf "
1022776,Acountdeleted,2018-02-13 02:31:00,2562,Page 5 of 10 on the right side half way down. (I love the way we can upload photos now) 
1022777,G.mech,2018-02-13 02:34:00,830,DOH......okay thanks.   I am officially blind.  I read that at least 10 times and even after you showed me I had a hard time finding it.  If this is what old age has in store I don't think I want to see 55.
1022789,BillM,2018-02-13 14:52:00,17367,Should have left it the 15th as Sinker mentioned above.
1022790,Acountdeleted,2018-02-13 14:59:00,2562,"I wish. Months of planning for this day and I have to move it back. :S I mean, its not the end of the world. Its just frustrating.  In 2022 the lake will be closed until the 19th. I know its just a couple of days but still.  I wonder how many people will be out on the ice on the Friday because the didn't read the new regs."
1022796,AKRISONER,2018-02-13 16:44:00,5558,lol and you know the CO will be out there busting everyone too.
1022804,misfish,2018-02-13 18:27:00,29133,And showing no sympathy.  What Time we meeting up Jer ?LOL
1022806,BillM,2018-02-13 18:42:00,17367,No excuse for not reading the regs.
1022814,SirCranksalot,2018-02-13 20:08:00,3291,"You missed my point. If they fixed it at some date slightly before fam day----say the 10th---considering that fam day changes every year, then there would be no confusion like we are seeing here right now."
1022815,Acountdeleted,2018-02-13 20:11:00,2562,My confusion was mostly just because they changed the regs from 2017 to 2018.  Also more so wishful thinking then confusion.
1022825,drwxr,2018-02-13 22:53:00,453,"The should be no confusion. If you say you work monday to friday, it means you work the friday. If the regs state the ban is jan 1 to friday, it means the ban if still on for friday."
1022826,Acountdeleted,2018-02-13 23:16:00,2562,You clearly have never been to my office.
