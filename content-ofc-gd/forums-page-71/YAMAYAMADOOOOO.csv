1022224,Fisherman,2018-02-03 23:54:00,7201,"Quite the machine, remember seeing the one on #11 eons ago, way up on the pole.  Read somewhere there were a couple of mishaps with ATV's going for a plop in the cracks, both got rescued."
1022225,kickingfrog,2018-02-03 23:56:00,8333,That would be fun to tool around on.
1022233,LeXXington,2018-02-04 01:51:00,1928,Can I request a cappuccino machine ?

1022262,Terry,2018-02-04 16:24:00,14456,I said Extension Cord  as an excuse to not bring a cappuccino machine Now i have no reason not to
1022264,misfish,2018-02-04 16:49:00,29133,"You have a coffee maker already. Propane. If your not going to use it, I will. LOL"
