1023024,SirCranksalot,2018-02-16 02:48:00,3291,I guess I have never fished in current so strong that I could actually see the line move off the vertical.
1022617,huzzsaba,2018-02-10 15:37:00,884,"I spent some time this morning and came up with this setup. Found all the stuff in the garage,so looks pretty ghetto lol.  I think the angles are pretty straight. Hopefully it works for us tomorrow!  Going out with Bear point Ice huts. Praying to catch my first Laker and whitefish!  "
1022649,Woodsman,2018-02-11 02:08:00,1286,Have you tried hanging it in water. The wood may effect it from hanging straight up & down. That's the reason I let it hang by the cord using the bracket to keep it level. Gravity with the only floatation at the top. Good luck tomorrow. 
1022650,chris.brock,2018-02-11 02:14:00,4053,"yeah, that might not work Huzz unless you get some pretty heavy weight down on the dowel near the ducer. maybe bring a bunch of stuff from the garage and play around with it when the bite is slow, good luck tomorrow, let us know how you do "
1022651,Fisherman,2018-02-11 02:17:00,7201,"Piece of straight PEX pipe, 1/2 or 3/4 is all you need  with some zip tied pool noodle around the top."
1022652,SirCranksalot,2018-02-11 03:01:00,3291,"I put a pipe coupling at the bottom of mine. Also, don't tie cable to top---it will pull the 'pipe' off vertical. I abandoned my version in favor of using a couple of zip ties, one of them thru a loop in the cable---don't have a pic right now to show you. "
1022660,PUMP KNOWS,2018-02-11 14:26:00,937,Maybe this would work for you?  
1022669,Sinker,2018-02-11 20:59:00,8692,"I have a tite lock clamp on transducer holder I can sell you cheap if your interested. I'm near peterborough though....  It would work great, and I have never used it. Just clamp it on a bucket and your good to go.  S."
1022678,SirCranksalot,2018-02-12 00:47:00,3291,"yeah, that's the sort of set-up I use."
1022746,huzzsaba,2018-02-12 21:30:00,884,Thanks.  I will send you a pm about it.
1022747,huzzsaba,2018-02-12 21:32:00,884,Thanks. I will try that out.
1022749,misfish,2018-02-12 22:06:00,29133,"Wont work in Simcoe current. That,s why I made what I did. Can tilt it the direction the line goes. The stick part removes for my open water fishing on my toon."
1022751,SirCranksalot,2018-02-12 22:38:00,3291,Wow! You mean there is enough current to pull the cable off vertical?  I have heard of people putting it right at the surface. 
1022757,chris.brock,2018-02-12 23:10:00,4053,"Not the cable, current pulling the line on an angle when fishing deep. How did the sonar work Huzz?"
1022759,huzzsaba,2018-02-12 23:48:00,884,It worked fine although I took apart the setup I made.  was useless and tipping over as you mentioned. i just dropped the transducer down and tried to get it to sit at a good angle. I think most of my earlier troubles was due to the settings. i was able to fine tune the settings to work just right or close enough I think I will invest in an ice transducer and or slightly higher end sonar with flasher for next season. May also invest in a portable hut and auger. Who knows!
1022760,misfish,2018-02-12 23:57:00,29133,"When you do, I will hook you up with a few spots."
1022762,huzzsaba,2018-02-13 00:10:00,884,Thanks Brian! I figured its a one time investment which should pay off in one or 2 seasons.
1022768,misfish,2018-02-13 01:09:00,29133,"Oh it,s alot more then that. LOL  BUT, IT,S FUN"
1022839,SirCranksalot,2018-02-14 03:46:00,3291,"OK, but but how can you tell which way the current is running?"
1022843,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-14 05:53:00,8243,"If there was  ""like"" option this thread would get 2 pages of likes. I have been using sonar for over 25 years but have learned much on this thread. Thanks go to you all. I don't know what we did to pass time on a slow or non excitant bite before we had cartoons to watch. Oh yea, drank beer. On my very first unit other than the flasher has an ice fishing set up. A portable with solid horizontal rod that goes to a vertical steel rod and the transducer has a bubble on it that shows dead level. When in a boat it suction cups to the transom. Eagle Ultra Fish I.D. that I can still use to this day if I knew who borrowed it."
1022844,Chuck Enwinde,2018-02-14 06:37:00,247,"You'll notice which way your line is ""leaning"" in areas with current.  Sometimes on Quinte you need drill a seperate hole a few feet down current to pick up your bait."
1022845,misfish,2018-02-14 09:51:00,29133,"  One morning on Simcoe for ch its and giggles, we drilled to see how far the bait was . We drilled just over 15 ft away to mark buddys jig in 112 fow. Simcoe current gets crazy."
1022848,AKRISONER,2018-02-14 13:35:00,5558,"maybe ti was just me, but my piranha max boat transducer had some trouble in cold water as well. I would get transducer not connected message, as soon as the unit warmed up it had no issues. Obviously, once it was not below zero the thing never had an issue."
1022849,SirCranksalot,2018-02-14 13:53:00,3291,"The main purpose of a sonar, apart from telling you the depth, is to keep the fisherman entertained so he doesn't get bored or discouraged and go home!! That's how they help catch fish---the guys stay out longer! My buddy and I spent 2-3 hrs w/o a single bite but we were watching quite a few 'window shoppers' come along for a look. Prob female fish looking for a better deal a bit further along. Without that entertainment we would prob have left after an hr or so. After 2-3 hrs my buddy was ""rewarded"" by a big 'nice looking' ling!!"
1022851,jimmer,2018-02-14 14:18:00,2730,"I have noticed that mine is starting to die near the end of the day and I believe that it has to do with the battery.  It used to last me almost three days and now it is tough to make it through the day. I use the same set up as you.  Not sure how old you battery is, but that might be it."
1022927,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-15 03:22:00,8243,"Huzz,  I can't seem to be able to PM with the new format or I would have for this info. You need to get a copy of this Springs CAA magazine. The Volvo Agera RS Supercar has a top speed of 447.19 KPH, no not a typo, 447.19 KPH at I don't know how many G's welding you in the seat. The Polestar 1 looks like a 2 door Maserati concept car, the rear spoiler deploys from the trunk once the car hits 100KPH.

1022222,huzzsaba,2018-02-03 23:48:00,884,"I bought a used fishfinder a few years ago. Honestly I haven't used it much.  I used it twice this year however for ice fishing.  The fishfinder is a low end Lowrance X4.  Bought it just to play around with to get a feel of what a fishfinder does. It seems to work fine but I noticed that there may be some lag, and near the end of the ice fishing day, I was able to jig up and down but it never showed anything on the screen. By then I had packed it away thinking maybe the the boat transducer was not meant for the cold waters of ice fishing. Anyways, I am planning to go for Laker fishing next week with Bear Point Ice huts, and was hoping to use it, but feel it may not be useful.  maybe its due to the fact that it is a low end unit, or maybe something to do with the setting.  Depth and temps it shows fine.  I have been using it on the 200 khz setting, and kept the transducer pretty much in the correct position about a foot below the ice.  Here is a link to the fishfinder http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/lowrance-x-4-pro-fish-finder-0793989p.html  Any help would be appreciated."
1022223,Fisherman,2018-02-03 23:52:00,7201,"Big thing is to start with a good fully charged battery, make sure all connectors are clean and tight. Make sure the power/transducer cables are not corroded and fully inserted.   There are currents in the water and sometimes your jig or whatever you use may not show because it's outside the zone."
1022226,huzzsaba,2018-02-04 00:05:00,884,"Thanks for your reply Fisherman.  The battery was fully charged and I am sure the connections are all good.  I will double check though. Last I used it , was in 15 feet of water and I could see my lure on the bottom, so it was well within the zone.  Again it may be user error  on my part."
1022227,kickingfrog,2018-02-04 00:06:00,8333,"The water temp isn't a problem. As mentioned a battery getting low on charge might be. If you are pulling it out of the hole a lot you could have some ice forming on the 'ducer but that should melt. Definitely bring it. adjust the settings to increase the sensitivity and yes there is a lot of current areas where sometimes your presentation isn't ""in the cone""."
1022228,OhioFisherman,2018-02-04 00:09:00,6623,Since you mentioned near the end of the day? Maybe the cold was affecting the battery?
1022230,kickingfrog,2018-02-04 01:27:00,8333,My understanding is that some of the earlier generations of LCD's had problems below zero. Not sure if this would explain your problems though.
1022232,huzzsaba,2018-02-04 01:35:00,884,"Thanks for all the replies. It's possible it's the battery, however I doubt it is due to the cold since it was nice and toasty in the hut, and the fish finder and battery was sitting on the bench away from the ice Quick question, for laker fishing, should I keep it at 200 kHz or switch it to 83 khz? This is on simcoe btw so I guess the depth is 100 ft plus. First time trying this laker thing lol. Thanks again!"
1022235,Fisherman,2018-02-04 01:54:00,7201,"I can only say on my old one it had a 200 kHz transducer and I could mark a 1/4 ounce jig in 100 FOW.  same with any of the small williams spoons, etc."
1022239,huzzsaba,2018-02-04 02:47:00,884,I will give it a try at 200 kHz. Thanks
1022241,chris.brock,2018-02-04 02:54:00,4053,Do you have an ice transducer or are you trying to aim a regular transducer straight down in a vertical position?
1022242,huzzsaba,2018-02-04 03:00:00,884,"Chris, I am using the regular transducer. Best way to explain how it sits in the water is like the blade of a hockey stick. I will try to get a photo of it."
1022243,chris.brock,2018-02-04 03:06:00,4053,"I do that too. If it gets a little off kilter it can't mark your bait. Nothing wrong with a cheaper unit Huzz, just less definition and less fancy colors. Are you zooming in on bottom when you're down 100'?"
1022244,huzzsaba,2018-02-04 03:20:00,884,I haven't tried it yet a in anything more than 15 feet. I will be perch fishing this friday so I will play around with it some more to get a better feel for it.  Btw the battery charger you gave me is coming to good use ?
1022246,chris.brock,2018-02-04 04:42:00,4053,"like I said before, I have a bunch of chargers, I'm glad you could use it, very classy but not necessary or expected giving me a timmies card in return"
1022247,drwxr,2018-02-04 09:26:00,453,"it's too weak to mark small jigs in deep water, get something that has 500 RMS"
1022249,Woodsman,2018-02-04 12:06:00,1286,Make sure you transducer is hanging level in the water. If not the beam will be concentrated off to the side. Also increase your ping speed to the maximum speed.
1022253,Big Cliff,2018-02-04 13:06:00,6899,"Ice fishing is the perfect opportunity to learn how to use your fish finder, nice stable platform to work from! As for your transducer unless it's a dual frequency then set your unit to whatever the transducer frequency is (there should be a little tag on the cable that tells you what it is (probably 200 khz) Start off with something larger like a pop can filled with water and tied to a line so you have a good solid target to work with then play with your settings, I like a very high scroll speed because the screen refreshes quickly. Then play with your sensitivity settings and gain settings, when you can see the pop can at whatever depth try something smaller and adjust for that but only adjust one setting at a time until you figure out what works best for each setting then what combination. I would leave the zoom until the very last, I don't use mine a lot because I find it limits the detail on the rest of the water column (although there are times when it is really helpful). Learning how to interpret what you are seeing will really help too, I can't tell you how many guys I have watched trying to understand what they are seeing on the screen. Best thing though is fish with someone that has a unit and knows how to use it properly and will spend the time to help you, it makes the learning curve much shorter!"
1022254,Garnet,2018-02-04 13:27:00,2056,Your 2 main adjustments are ping speed and how fast your screen moves across I think it's called chart speed. I always jack both up to max and then slowly reduce. 
1022258,Mister G,2018-02-04 14:17:00,1429,"The 200h kz frequency will give you approximately 20 degree cone so it's about 1/3 of the depth......for example in 100' of water the cone circle would be about 33'. Now with the 83 hkz it will triple that area of cone circle and easier to find fish or see your jig. So a 60 degree circle. I have a excellent diagram of these cone angles and I ""think"" I just uploaded the pic. "
1022259,huzzsaba,2018-02-04 15:18:00,884,"    Thanks for all the above replies! Big Cliff, next trip is with the family perch fishing, and knowing too many lines in the water cause tangles, will leave the fishing duties for some time to the wife and kiddos while I play around with the settings and the angle of the transducer. Battery in currently on the charger.  Hopefully with some tweaking and monitoring the angle of transducer will solve my issues.  "
1022263,misfish,2018-02-04 16:28:00,29133,"Another thing is, is your ducer below the ice surface ? You need to be under it. I had a bit of a tracking issue yesterday. Tilting the ducer around seemed to help a bit, but not like it should be. I ended up chipping the ice away so the ducer would be under the ice surface. Worked fine after. I use a boat ducer for this unit. I have another that uses the ice ducer, but the 4"" screen drives me nuts.  "
1022301,huzzsaba,2018-02-04 23:31:00,884,"Brian, thanks for the photos.  Next time you go, if you don't mind take a photo of the orientation of the transducer when in the water. I am working on making something similar to what you have made.  Simple and genius!"
1022306,Woodsman,2018-02-05 09:32:00,1286,In the past I've used a set-up like this. 
1022325,Sinker,2018-02-05 15:47:00,8692,"The deeper you go, the more important it is to have the transducer perfectly level in the hole. Basically, the line on the transducer that sections it in half, is the line that needs to be level. If its out of level a few degrees, it makes a big difference. Not such an issue in 15ft of water, but in 100ft it is the difference between seeing your jig or not. S."
1022327,misfish,2018-02-05 16:42:00,29133,"Yupper  I usually drop my meegs down right at the start. Let it dead stick a few turns off the bottom, then set up my ducer."
