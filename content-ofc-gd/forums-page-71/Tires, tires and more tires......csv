1022750,John,2018-02-12 22:31:00,2956,I have a fair number of last season tires that I am moving out at cost or less to make room for 2018 inventory. There is everything from Truck tires to Performance Tires. Before I put them on Kijiji I figured I would give OFC members a look and see if anything floats your boat. I will install and balance any set for $50.00 including full manufacturers warranty and additional 5 year tire protection plan that gives free flat tire repair at over 70 stores in Ontario and pro-rated road hazard warranty. The Tire Protection Plan is $40.00 alone. If you want  a sneak preview send me size by PM.. I will post a list in classifieds tomorrow.......thanks Art for OK'ing this...

1022808,Old Ironmaker,2018-02-13 18:50:00,8243,Great gesture to offer them here 1st John. Where were you last Fall when I needed 8 tires?
1022809,John,2018-02-13 19:18:00,2956,"Thanks for the kind words. My Ad has been up on OFC for more than a year though. As always I offer OFC members the best possible prices on Tires and will always give 20% off labour and 10% off parts for any maintenance and repair work. Oil changes 29.95 for conventional, 49.95 for semi-synthetic and 69.95 for full synthetic get you up to 5 litres of oil, and a standard oil filter, (some vehicles use more oil and take non standard filters).....This includes a 30 point vehicle inspection..........we will never recommend any work not required and never pressure you into doing work that is required. However, we will tell you what is urgent and what can wait."
