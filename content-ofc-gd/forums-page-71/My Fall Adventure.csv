1022414,Roy,2018-02-06 14:17:00,13728,Outstanding report! Love those clips. Thanks for posting that!
1022421,Beavertail,2018-02-06 17:13:00,331,"Sweet video, really liked the Spey rod and the little bushcraft at the end!"
1022433,BillM,2018-02-06 19:23:00,17367,"Very nice, need to add pinks to my list this summer!"
1022435,misfish,2018-02-06 21:32:00,29133,"Enjoyed very much. Very nice river you have there. I caught myself watching the tip and line through out the fly section. . Im with Bill here, that would be a treat.  Are there drift boats in that area ? Guides?"
1022438,BillM,2018-02-07 00:14:00,17367,"Not going to see many driftboats up that way, Tyler Dunn would be the guy to talk to in the Sault if you wanna tackle some pinks."
1022439,misfish,2018-02-07 00:23:00,29133,"I do have a contact for the area Bill. A buddies son whom goes to collage up there, and is trying to be a MNR officer.  He is having a blast up there.  Wish I did this looking back 35 years ago.  Then again, I would missed the Sis pools down here. LOL  "
1022440,BillM,2018-02-07 00:25:00,17367,Get some spots and we'll make a weekend out of it
1022441,cl_fishin,2018-02-07 00:28:00,138,"Thanks guys, I really don't know of any drift boats around there, but Tyler Dunn would be a good place to start for a guide. "
1022446,misfish,2018-02-07 01:42:00,29133,Or yourself.
1022447,BillM,2018-02-07 03:08:00,17367,I've fished the Michipicoten when I was younger for pinks with the oldman in late August.   Always a riot.   Chinook fishing off the mouth into the big lake was always good as well.
