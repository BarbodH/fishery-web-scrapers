1021967,aws,2018-01-28 16:17:00,53,"from the free press ""In other news, recreational retailer SAIL will anchor the proposed PenEquity development south of Highway 401, just west of Wellington Road."""
1021974,Dutch01,2018-01-28 18:27:00,1431,"I dont live in the area, but it's nice to see a Canadian owned business expanding. Now if only they'd come to Markham. It's Oshawa or Vaughn for the nearest SAIL for me."
1021975,DanD,2018-01-28 18:44:00,2223,"Yeah there's a number of businesses moving out that way. Princess Auto has opened their new store, across from Costco (Kitty corner); supposedly a lot bigger and hopefully more organized? MY wife calls Princess Auto the MANS Avon store. LOL Dan."
1021981,misfish,2018-01-28 20:57:00,29133,"Need one to come to Barrie, and put Cabelas in their place. I do not mind driving to Vaughan, but would be nice."
1021984,ketchenany,2018-01-28 21:45:00,3229,Why would they put a Sail in Woody! Barrie having a lake close by would have made more sense. Come on B you like to mingle with the paesanos. Lol I have a bottle of wine with your name on it! And a book!!!!
1021986,captpierre,2018-01-28 22:19:00,2521,Agreed
1022009,bow slayer,2018-01-29 11:53:00,1074,they are also building a new costco and ikea in the same area so that area will be alot busier soon. I have heard sail will be moving into the current costco location once the new costco is built.
1022089,grimsbylander,2018-01-30 14:50:00,3016,I hope Sail drops a location across the street from every BPS and Cabelas in Canada. Having some competition up here is a very good thing.
1022091,misfish,2018-01-30 16:47:00,29133,"They had their chance here when Target closed up. Now it,s a Toy R Us. Closing up stores in the states and opened a new one in Barrie? REALLY???????? I believe the land that holds this large mega store collaboration, is American owned. I see sails opening up here in a year or two.  I have also been trying to find out when the Cabelas.ca here, changes it,s  name to BPS. They say they are Canadian owned and no affiliation. Hence why when you asked to have a item shipped up from the American store, they said no, we don't do that. "
1022113,LeXXington,2018-01-31 14:30:00,1928,Not that I don't love Sail and 100% support that it is Canadian. I just question its longevity. Its a private Canadian company that has no reason to post financials but expansion comes at a huge cost. Are the current stores making enough to expand or is it burning money in short term for long term gain. Retail is a tough market. 
1022117,misfish,2018-01-31 16:37:00,29133,"I have to admit, when I go to the one in Vaughan, it is not busy. Then again, Im not there during the peak seasons. Hunting for one. Im sure it,s very busy then. What I like about the store is the vast variety  and their prices. They beat BPS on most things I want. Heck, even Wal mart.  Edit to add, I support the local shop here, but he cant carry everything."
1022119,Bass Tard,2018-01-31 18:04:00,128,"I'm excited for it!  Angling Sports is a great store too, with good staff, but I like having options."
1022700,Handlebarz,2018-02-12 05:22:00,3790,We don't need a Sail store in London as there are a few great local stores that all provide amazing service to the local community. I hope that they don't get hurt with a big box moving in like other areas have.
1022712,lastcall,2018-02-12 14:29:00,33,Whenever I get a notice that Sail is having a sale I go to their site only to find that almost all sale items are not available at my location (Etobicoke) and they will not transfer from a store that has what I'm looking for. Very frustrating.
