1022727,glen,2018-02-12 18:59:00,2641,Didn’t fish while I was there but the surf pounds the north end. All kind of junk washes up on shore there.  Should be good fishing if not windy.  Guy I know did a charter and they did well off the north end.
1022728,ketchenany,2018-02-12 19:09:00,3229,I'm with Glen. always a steady east wind. We stayed at the Riu Palm Beach and it was gorgeous. Going to try Curacao in April.
1022736,bobowski,2018-02-12 20:16:00,360,Did a charter there about 5 years ago. Caught some Mahi Mahi's. We went out with Driftwood Charters.  
1022737,Sinker,2018-02-12 20:36:00,8692,"Thanks guys! Driftwood seems to be one of the popular ones. Mixed reviews. I never know where to book at these places, so I usually wait until I'm there and check out the boats when I get there to see who has what and who is actually catching. I'm not sure about aruba. I may book ahead. I will be fishing for sure. I'd love to get one of those mahi mahis!!!! Nice catch!! I always bring gear as well, so if there is any chance of shore fishing, I'm doing it.  S."
