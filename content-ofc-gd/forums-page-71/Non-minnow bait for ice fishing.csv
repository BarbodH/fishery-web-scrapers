1022116,Acountdeleted,2018-01-31 16:23:00,2562,"Still hoping to get out a few times before the season is over but one of the main factors is going to be that 2018 is on a budget. Though I can't do anything about the gas used to get to the lake I figure I can save a few bucks not buying minnows. Though the deal is good at a lot of places I don't really have a way of making salties or keeping them alive. So I figure I'll go another route.  I've heard good things about waxies and figure I can pick them up at the pet store. What else has worked for people that's live? I know the crazies like B will tell me not to use bait, but I have always found adding meat just seems to make the fish that much more hungry."
1022120,BillM,2018-01-31 18:17:00,17367,What are you fishing for?
1022122,Acountdeleted,2018-01-31 19:31:00,2562,I'll probably get out once more for perch and small lakers.
1022123,BillM,2018-01-31 19:33:00,17367,"Lakers no live bait required, really it's a waste especially on Simcoe.   For perch I like using maggots or wax worms.  Definitely cheaper then minnows."
1022124,misfish,2018-01-31 20:01:00,29133,Williams spoon. Catches everything.
1022125,porkpie,2018-01-31 20:21:00,2521,"I saw waxies for $7 for a dozen in a bait shop near guilford a while back.  I just about doubled over laughing.  I can get a scoop of minnows for about $6 on the west side, and $5 on the east side of Simcoe.  Pet shop waxies aren't super cheap either, it's probably just as economical to buy a scoop of minnows.  If you really want to save money all you need is a half minnow on a buckshot rattle spoon or jigging rap for perch, even jumbos will eat that happily.  Lakers I wouldn't really worry to much about bait but for perch it can make all the difference having a bit of scent.  Making salties is about as hard as dumping your remaining minnows in a ziplock and pouring in a bit of iodized salt on top.  That's all I've ever done for the last 25 years.  Anyway, waxworms definately won't be a big money saver in my experience.  They used to sell 50 for $5, but that's a long time ago.  Even power baits etc won't save you a lot of bread.  They dry out over time, or leak, and cost $7 a jar but can be pretty effective and I always carry some."
1022126,jimmer,2018-01-31 20:30:00,2730,"Geez, what's wrong with using little pieces of dew worms.  I buy a dozen at the beginning of the year and it usually last me the whole winter when going for panfish.  I just put a 1/4"" - 1/2"" piece on it lasts for a number of fish. I do like using minnows on Simcoe though, but worms have worked well for me there also. Wax worms are costly and they don't last long on the hook."
1022128,misfish,2018-01-31 21:35:00,29133,I had a jar for 4 years. Juice evaporated by then. Still work. $7 for a jar over that span is super cheap.
1022129,SylvanOwner,2018-01-31 21:43:00,266,buy a pack of white Power Grubs.  Tip spoon with one or even 2.  They last forever.  Lifetime supply in one bag....almost.
1022131,SirCranksalot,2018-01-31 22:15:00,3291,Why not just freeze the dead minnows instead of salting them?
1022139,smitty55,2018-02-01 01:32:00,928,They turn to mush once frozen. When salted they never freeze hard. Windshield washer fluid works well as a preservative too but I still add salt for flavour after taking them out of the freezer.  Cheers
1022146,Woodsman,2018-02-01 03:03:00,1286,"For perch once you catch one keeper remove the eye balls. Great bait which last for far more than one fish. Notice I said a ""keeper"". No plucking eye balls from a dink & than letting it go."
1022234,Acountdeleted,2018-02-04 01:54:00,2562,"Adding to this, anyone use these with success. $3 plus looks like they'll last a few trip. "
1022267,misfish,2018-02-04 17:36:00,29133,Where are they from ? What is in the brine ?  Think you get my point.
1022272,Acountdeleted,2018-02-04 18:18:00,2562,From Sail. Garenteed no VHS. Dunno. I'll taste one and tell you how good the brine is when I eat one.
1022273,misfish,2018-02-04 18:25:00,29133," LOL  See, I knew you knew. Feel free to put on a cracker."
1022274,misfish,2018-02-04 18:30:00,29133,"I remember when I first tried Uncle Josh minnows in a jar. Didnt work for me.  Jer, if you can get to a bait place, ask for the dead minnows. Im sure you will get a bunch at a real good price. Then salt them.     "

1022473,maker a laker,2018-02-07 19:17:00,33,"Guys, Tried the salted emerald shiners from SAIL this past weekend. Added them to a Williams ice blade & various jigs. They stay on as well as fresh live minnows without the thrashing around. Stiff enough to hook through the head no shredding or tearing. I cut a few into small pieces to salt various drilled holes over night as well. Did not specifically help with catching fish though. I will try them again on different lures. "
