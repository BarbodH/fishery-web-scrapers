57438,urbanangler1990,2007-04-09 17:24:00,933,"i have a question about the cork handle on these rods, they are split handle, have a space in between, what is this for? some people said its for casting, some for balance, some just cus the looks, is this a good spinning rod for plastics? tia"
57460,Headhunter,2007-04-09 18:12:00,5703,"I believe that they do that to the rod seat to increase the sensitivity to the angler. Direct hand contact to the blank is supposed to give you a better feel for light hits and taps. Quantum makes a pretty good rod for the money, heck, you can buy 4 for the price of some of the more expensive rods. I've had my 6.6ft Quamtum jiggin rod for many years, no problems. HH"
57470,Minnow,2007-04-09 18:33:00,177,Just as headhunter said it is for added sensitivity so that you can have direct contact with the graphite blank allowing you to feel more bites.
57474,Spiel,2007-04-09 18:50:00,9065,.....Since I don't know anyone who actually holds a spinning rod in this area I'd say it all about looks and even more so about cost cutting for the manufacturer. The price of cork is rather expensive.
57475,urbanangler1990,2007-04-09 18:52:00,933," hmm i noticing that too, its quite uncomfortable to hold it there"
57478,Headhunter,2007-04-09 19:04:00,5703,"Well, you could always ""Red Green"" it and add duct tape or black electrical tape! Just pretend it's an ice fishin rod!LOL HH"
57528,NANUK,2007-04-09 21:27:00,797,"Is this the type of handle you're talking about?    If yes, then it is mainly designed for drop shotting, I have never used one so don't know what would be the advantage,  but I do believe its just another design and the rod can be used for various applications besides drop shotting."
57560,grt1,2007-04-09 22:22:00,638,"I got one of these rods last year and I like it. I think it is mainly a design effort to make it look like the series one rod that was out a few years ago. Whatever the reason. I dont hold mine in that area, I just hold my finger over the line for feeling the bite."
57580,urbanangler1990,2007-04-09 22:50:00,933," yeah thats exactly the type im talking about, is that rod only used from a boat, and is used to jig with?"
57772,BabyHerc,2007-04-10 03:15:00,285,"Serves 2 purposes: first, it lightens up the outfit, and second, gives you a point closer to your body to keep a finger or 2 (or full hand) on the blank for sensitivity, while maintainting comfort."
57786,kennyman,2007-04-10 03:29:00,737,"I bought one of these after intense comparison shopping at the Spring Fishing show. It s an IM8 rod for a reasonable price. Looks good to me,but I've only used it in the rec room so far LOL. Oh yeah,the Quantum rep gave me a beauty free hat too."
