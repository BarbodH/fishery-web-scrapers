56251,BFSC Kevin,2007-04-06 22:14:00,1351,interesting.. nice to know.. thanks
56256,pikehunter,2007-04-06 22:34:00,1659,"I had a tax, probably this one, added to my bill at one of Niagara's restaurants one time. I questioned it and was told it was a tourist tax. That was the first and the last time I have seen it. I was also not told that it was not mandatory. So if it voluntary who would want to pay it?"
56258,fishindevil,2007-04-06 22:36:00,6254,"Thanks for the info...but why would they do this.  ..is it just to scam & screw people out of their money,isnt a tax like that illegal????  how can they do this, well i would like to screw them with my own version of levy tax.  ..."
56262,lew,2007-04-06 22:43:00,12767,"Not to hijack your thread Kelvin, but now that Toronto has been given the power from the province to impose it's own taxes, were gonna be looking at a whole list of things with additional taxes added on.  Booze, movies, entertainment, theaters and who knows what else.  Perhaps this is the same type of thing that Niagara is being allowed to do ??"
56264,John,2007-04-06 22:50:00,2956,"It seems like so called tourist areas have been granted the ability to impose a levy under the guise of tourism development! Guess where the additional few % points go......into the pockets of the already overpriced places that are charging it.  I was in Niagara on the Lake last year with my wife and we bought a few items to take back for our grandchildren. When we discovered the so called additional tax I challenged the store and they said it was a ""tourist tax"". When I asked whether it was a provincial or municipal tax she got a little upset and said ""it costs a lot to run a store you know"". At that point we left!"

56273,Clampet,2007-04-06 23:26:00,1947,"Corporate thievery, legal of course."
56276,express168,2007-04-06 23:39:00,327,"If I am not mistaken it has existed for a few years now and I believe it is meant to be pooled together for international promotion of the area. So for commercials and ads to attract Americans and the Japanese etc to the Falls as a tourist destination. Because it is not as if these hotels haven't already included advertising in the room rates they charge  . Typical Canadian solution , We will just add a new tax!"
56288,Loonietoon,2007-04-06 23:55:00,1450,"I only found out about this today.. my daughter was in Niagara Falls and also found it on her charge card.. Also found out that they don't have to tell you that its there... Wife found out about it on the radio the other day from a Radio talk host when he Questioned it on his meal bill and he was told it was a Voluntary Tax Levy and that if he did not want to pay it, then they would take it off his bill. Wife is going to see if he has it on his Web Site and I will let you all know.  Lew.. I know that Toronto want to put levy on thing to but if we let these people get a way with this type of thing, then they will do what ever they want and we wont be able to do a thing about it.  Will try to see if I can find the Web Site."
56295,Rich Clemens,2007-04-07 00:34:00,3131,"A voluntary tax and you don't have to pay it if you don't want to ?    Geez, I've never heard of that before ... anywhere.  I stayed just outside Niagara Falls on one of my fishing trips and didn't even take notice if it was applied or not.  I'll be staying there again this year and will have to keep this in mind.   Appreciate sharing this info."
57536,Rich Clemens,2007-04-09 21:46:00,3131,"I did a little searching and found mention of this.  http://www.niagarafalls.ca/tourism/index.asp  This is a little blurb from the above site.  Destination Marketing Fee (DMF) Is the 3% Destination Marketing Fee (DMF) or Destination Promotion Fee (DPF) a Tax? No, the fee is not a tax. It is a voluntary fee that is collected by establishments for additional marketing. As of 2004, the fee applies to guests rooms rented for less than 30 days. These legislated levies are automatically applied to a guestâ€™s hotel bill.  What other Cities have a DMF or similar fees? Many major North American cities have hotel taxes. Toronto, Hamilton, Ottawa, Edmonton are examples of different cities that collect a DMF from visitors. Others include Victoria, Quebec City, New York and Chicago.  What do the establishments do with the money raised from the DMF? In Niagara Falls the money they generate is earmarked for advertising and other initiatives to attract more tourists and deliver more services to visitors while in the City. The fee, when used for marketing, promotion and Destination enhancements, will ensure that Niagara Falls continues to be promoted as a must see destination and that visitor experiences in our destination will be enhanced through additional programming and special events"
57610,Loonietoon,2007-04-10 00:02:00,1450,Thanks Rich.. Still waiting for a response from the Radio Personality that is going to put it on his site as there has been a lot of people not knowing about it asking??/ This is also being applied to different things like food as well as other things. I think with the prices they charge they should be well covered with out putting more on the bill without telling the customer...???
57613,irishfield,2007-04-10 00:05:00,26272,"Question is...is it ""voluntary"" for the establishment to charge it....or ""voluntary"" for you to pay it??"
57616,Loonietoon,2007-04-10 00:12:00,1450,Wayne it is voluntary that you pay... Apparently you can have it removed from your bill
57623,grt1,2007-04-10 00:16:00,638,"this tax has been added to my bill in the City of Kenora also. However, when I questioned it nothing was said that it was voluntary. The hotel made it seem mandatory and I understand it is remitted to the City to promote the City. I have also paid this in Winnipeg at the Casinos."
