I'm going to put the dead minnows and worms into a blender untill there almost liquid and suck them into a large syringe and inject the soft plastic with the concoction.  Just another genius idea I though of today."
57655,Heybud_e,2007-04-10 00:43:00,208,"cool, your own Stink bait... maybe add some eggs of some sort... lemme know id like to try it out.."
57663,Roy,2007-04-10 00:49:00,13728,So who's breakfast are you making with the blender afterwards?

57809,pikehunter,2007-04-10 09:26:00,1659,Add some yogurt and ice and...MMMmmmmmmm...smoooothie
57818,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-10 11:03:00,181,Tell us how the fishing works out with those baits!
57821,aplumma,2007-04-10 11:07:00,6896,Since the amino acids break down and the scent changes you have a pretty good recipe for small catfish( less than 10 lbs) bait. After 10 lbs they need to become active predators to survive so live/fresh dead bait is the best option. One of the guys here blends and freezes it into chum blocks that he drifts behind the boat.

57836,Joey,2007-04-10 12:09:00,9122,Why don't you try freezing them and then thawing them out just before going on your next trip?  Might work.  Or what if you pickled them in a nice herring sauce?  Joey
