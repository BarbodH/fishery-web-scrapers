57282,douG,2007-04-09 03:37:00,2693,"HeyBud,  thass way too much info right there, esp about the sweating part.  Roy, nice job as always.  And Granny sounds like a real cutup, good genes in that family.  Like Roy sez,  that's the sorta attitude that works.  I'd be real careful with that keeper there.  As for Roy's attitude, that's just wrong."
