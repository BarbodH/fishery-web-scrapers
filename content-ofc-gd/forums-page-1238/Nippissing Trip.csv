Im planning a trip up to Nippissing this May/June and IM having a hard time investigating somewhere to stay. Any folks out there with any ideas for a week long stay on the Lake would be great. I dont need an ""A"" frame waterfront log cabin......but i would like a clean cabin on the water with a boat dock. Just a shot in the dark guys, thanks in advance......looking forward to conversing with a new group here!"

20440,setomonkey,2007-01-08 20:25:00,872,"I think there's a few fans of Lakair Lodge on the board...  Check out its neighbours too, like Samoset or Memquisit.  Mike"
20459,Bernie,2007-01-08 20:53:00,3190,"Also the other end of the lake is Promised Land Camp,Tom Rae Lodge,Sunset Cove,Sunlit Bay, Waltonian Inn and a host of others. If you decide to stay at the south shore side give me a pm and I will assist if you like."

20723,iceguy,2007-01-09 15:57:00,341, Is there another Hyatt in the Calander area... I think it's Rob Hyatt and he runs a good ship. Been to his bungalow's the last few years(not this year of course)
20759,snackpack5150,2007-01-09 18:14:00,79,We meaning my family have stayed at Promised Land camp a couple of  years in a row untill we bought our own cottage!!!... it's not a bible camp!!!  Frank and Claire do a great job of making sure you have everything you need. Cottages are very clean the grounds are the same if you haven't fished Nippising Frank will show you spots and is very informative as to what to use and the depth to fish and look for.   Good Luck  Ken

57757,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-10 02:34:00,212,I fished every part of that Lake for 8 years straight every May/June.  Have to say you cannot do better then West Bay area for Pike and Callender Bay for Walleye.  Take your pick.

57775,fishingguy28,2007-04-10 03:16:00,98,"been to a few of the mentioned places above..... 2 that  i have stayed at are sandy haven and Adventure camp ohio.... both are same in terms of the cabin quality, cleans and simple.... Tv's in both.... only difference is that sandy haven gives you the option to upgrade your boat to a nice one if your renting  and it's right on the lake.....Adventure camp ohio is on the south river and boats are simple 16ft with a 15 on the back....  other info   Sandy haven is more expensive, adventure camp ohio is cheaper.....  camp ohio also includes all the gas in the boat rental!!!"
