56802,Corey,2007-04-08 04:31:00,355,Oh my gosh. wow.
56803,taper,2007-04-08 04:38:00,611,Now that was an upset. Hope the Canadian get back on his game.
56805,andrey7474,2007-04-08 04:46:00,47,what's going on with mma world lately?
56808,glirw,2007-04-08 04:50:00,200,"There is something very weird in MMA right now , I can't explain it , it's like , the plague of the underdog !!  GSP will be back strong ... he just had a very stupid game plan in this fight ."
56809,Mattitude,2007-04-08 04:59:00,155,"Man I don't like that Hughes,  the smirk on his face after GSP got beat.  I think if GSP sees that he may want a shot at him again.  Diego had that coming to him as well, he was getting a little too confident."
56810,glirw,2007-04-08 05:04:00,200,"Hughes should have come into the cage afterwards and said : "" I was not impressed by your performance """
56814,andrey7474,2007-04-08 05:09:00,47,  )  +1
56816,Mattitude,2007-04-08 05:16:00,155,"That would be funny,  but GSP would still lay him out all over again."
56838,Chris,2007-04-08 11:22:00,405,Wowwwweeee
56852,Terry,2007-04-08 12:36:00,14456,good bye  Georges St-Pierre..what the hell was that....  couple of fights were great the rest were crap
56907,Deano,2007-04-08 15:21:00,767,"Sounds like most should stick to fishing. Open mouth, insert foots. LOL"
56911,Clampet,2007-04-08 15:28:00,1947," Yeah, I noticed that too.  Mr Bigmouth.  Jealous is all."
56917,glirw,2007-04-08 15:44:00,200,"In the post fight comments , GSP said he felt stiff coming into the fight , he wasn't mentally there ....  If you rewatch the fight ..... you can tell even from when he is walking to the cage and when he's in the cage that something is not right ... I saw it last night even before he lost .  Serra is bad for the sport. He can't defend the belt against Hughes , let alone Koschek , or George on a better day .  For those that follow Pride , Pride 34 , Sokodjou is gonna be the frikkin champ ! That dude is serious ...."
56929,fliptheslop,2007-04-08 16:00:00,112,"How can you say Serra is bad for the sport, when the underdog comes along and slaps the champ like that is the best thing for any sport, if you like the outcome or not, thats what makes the game worth watching. I bet your a habs fan"
56940,BLACKFISH88,2007-04-08 16:16:00,191,I think the undercards were the best fights they have nothing to lose I think these guys are too worried about reps and stats than just gettin it on. After they have actually done something it's almost like they are too afraid of losing... diego almost was in boxing mode little too much time with de la hoya???That fight couldve went 12 rounds the way those panzies were dancing around each other I thought they both disgraced the sport and all the training they had done. imho one of the worst mma fights I have seen.I think gsp just made a mistake footwork looked funny something was up with him I think.
56941,glirw,2007-04-08 16:17:00,200,"I am always rooting for the underdog , I love upsets , BUT  The reason I say Serra isn't good for the division is because he can't defend the belt for long. Like I said , Hughes has superior wrestling to him, but after last night definitely not superior striking. Koschek would give Serra a very good run for his money George in a rematch would demolish Serra ... take my word for it .  P.S. I'm an Inter Milan fan , haha Not into hockey .   UFC needs yellow cards for fights like Diego vs. Kos . These guys train for months for that one fight , if they come and stall , then they should stay home on the couch . The fight is organized so that the fighters can prove that theyre superior . Waiting for the other guy to make a mistake should result in a loss of points."
56947,fliptheslop,2007-04-08 16:22:00,112,"If thats what your thinking is, than GSP should never fight again, because he didnt do a very good job defending his title, to get beat by someone who is a so called 10 to 1 underdog,  Milan is that a Breed of dog"
56949,BLACKFISH88,2007-04-08 16:23:00,191,"UFC needs yellow cards for fights like Diego vs. Kos . These guys train for months for that one fight , if they come and stall , then they should stay home on the couch . The fight is organized so that the fighters can prove that theyre superior . Waiting for the other guy to make a mistake should result in a loss of points.  this is a very good idea I think they might better have been wearing dresses in there."
56951,TJQ,2007-04-08 16:29:00,7806,I just stopped crying...  George .......
57341,Bitsmith2k,2007-04-09 12:45:00,396,"wow.. i'm still in shock.. with all the hype around gsp being unbeatable, this is unreal.. he'll come back and be better for it..  i'm going to go on record now and say lindland beats fedor on sat. that would be icing on the cake with all the big upsets this year.."
57371,Bob Apple,2007-04-09 14:08:00,37,"Was it me or did Serra not seem that excited! Now What?  GSP vs Huges, or Huges vs Serra! Good for Serra, but he is going to be hard to listen to! BIG HEAD!"
57377,glirw,2007-04-09 14:31:00,200,"With all the upsets this year , Lindland over Fedor is very possible, if only Fedor was a mere mortal ! I will never put a dime against Fedor . I don't expect to see Fedor submitting Lindland , but a 2nd round GnP victory is pretty much how it's gonna go down lol.  Lindland has a chance here to pound out a decision, but it's a small chance, only if he lays on top for all rounds without getting stood up ."
55793,tonyb,2007-04-05 20:10:00,1637,Dream Fight #1  Fedor   VS Randy   or even Chuck Liddell for an all out brawl  Can't wait to see what this merger will bring us...oh yeah MORE BLOOD  Tony
55798,TJQ,2007-04-05 20:18:00,7806,I love Randy... but hes no match for Fedor...
55807,tonyb,2007-04-05 20:55:00,1637,Fedor is a machine...I hear ya.
55865,fliptheslop,2007-04-05 23:51:00,112,I dont care who wins just as long as josh koscak gets beat so bad he can never step in the ring again
56061,Bob Apple,2007-04-06 14:35:00,37,Kosh will lose by submission in the first round! My prediction!
56140,CoolB,2007-04-06 17:05:00,47, Gary Goodridge still fights for K1. In fact he just fought and won within the last month or 2. Gary is always a fun fighter to watch and very strong but is just a bit below the talent level of the elite fighters.  gary goodridge
56144,CoolB,2007-04-06 17:12:00,47, The Ferrita brothers bought Pride but it's not being amalgamated into the UFC. Pride will still be Pride but now it will be called Pride Worldwide. It is going to take on the unified US MMA rules but they will still be run as 2 separate entities with with superbowl type events a few times a year. What I really hope for is the fighters to fight for both orgs.  I can't wait too see what the Gp's will be like now.
56168,Bob Apple,2007-04-06 18:09:00,37,Has anyone heard about UFC's deal with HBO and if that is going to ever happen!
56198,Clampet,2007-04-06 19:12:00,1947,St Pierre is a French Canadian. Couture is French name. Questions?
56205,andrey7474,2007-04-06 19:26:00,47,"Sera just has no tools to beat GSP, period. Randy is a great fighter but not a threat to Fedor at all. imo, CroCop is the one who have the best chance to beat Fedor, so my dream match is CC vs Fedor-2 along with Chuck vs. Shogun and Hendersson vs. Andersson Silva"
56218,RobHall,2007-04-06 19:59:00,261,"My 3x Dream MMA fights are.....  George ""Rush"" St Pierre     vs   Diago ""Nightmare"" Sanchez     This would be an excellent matchup. Here you have the current welterweight champ and an up an coming MMA fighter who has been turning heads in the UFC. St Pierre lists his strengths as ""Takedowns, ground-n-pound and overall strength. Sanchez lists his strengths as ""ground-n-pound and speed"". Sanchez has not lost an MMA fight (19-0) and St Pierre (13-1) just recently beat the crap out of Matt Hughes. I think this fight may be one of the best....if and when it happens.  I think the winner of the Sanchez vs Koscheck fight should be next in line for a shot at the UFC welterweight title.      Chuck ""The Iceman"" Liddell    vs  Quinton ""Ramage"" Jackson     Chuck Liddell (20-3) only has one unavenged loss and that is to Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson (26-6). I think this MMA matchup will be a another great fight. I also think Chuck ""The Iceman"" Liddell will knock him out in the late rounds to avenge is only loss.   This rematch is confirmed for May 26th @ UFC 71.  I can't wait.      Fedor ""The Russian Experiment"" Emelianenko    vs   Kevin ""Grizzly"" Adams     The only reason why i picked this fight is because there is no human MMA fighter on the planet who can beat Fedor.  I would give this hairy guy a chance though.  However i still think Fedor knocks him out or turns him into a pretzel.    FOTB "
56248,dobee,2007-04-06 21:45:00,301,"Just wanna add to the UFC Super fights.... i think gsp will have no problem with serra, sure serra is a good fighter but he CANNOT finish his fights, almost all of his wins have been in a decision... diego has been training his stand up with oscar de la hoya, which is huge for him, cause his ground game is already awsome.... and Liddel has been quoted as saying he wants to move up in weight to ""KO"" cro-cop and fedor...... also, theyre has been rumors about maurico shogun signing a 2 fight deal with ufc. Which would be an amazing fight... also, liddell vs wanderlei...  anderson silva vs gomi....  and in june... Brock Lesner ..former wwe star brock vs hong man choi , on the right 7'2"" 364 lbs choi  what a fight that will be... its an awsome time for MMA!!!"
56249,bucktail,2007-04-06 21:57:00,1857,"I just hope St Pierre doesn't hurt this guy too bad.  So thats were Brock went, I know he tried out for the vikings after he left WWE"
56260,andrey7474,2007-04-06 22:41:00,47,"  let me guess: your another favorite forum is sherdog.net, correct?     p.s. Fedor - is by far my most favorite fighter, even our company's main database server is called Fedor. the web server is called CroCop...no joke"
56311,TJQ,2007-04-07 01:02:00,7806,Liddle will ko jackson.. and make him cry like a baby.. again.. on the other hand.. both fedor and cro cop.. would beat liddle...  IMHO
56332,glirw,2007-04-07 01:23:00,200,"Quinton would school Liddell , but the UFC are feeding him to Liddell too early .  If you gave Rampage one or two more fights , he would get used to cage fighting and the UFC , and then do his bread and butter and KTFO Lideell."
56338,GbayGiant,2007-04-07 01:38:00,1780," Ya, he was working at the Honda plant and got fired for stealing out of the cafeteria is what a co worker told me years ago."
56378,andrey7474,2007-04-07 02:45:00,47," lol, looks like you've never seen Rampage-Silva (2 fights) and Rampage/ Shogun. Jackson has changed after those three brutal beatings."
56430,CoolB,2007-04-07 05:21:00,47, Hmm is that a good or bad thing. Oh well I know it's one of my favorite forums.
56525,steverowbotham,2007-04-07 15:53:00,1800," That was before his UFC debut, like a decade ago.  Gary is still around, my brother trains with him, he is in Cali right now training for the Hawaiian Grand Prix at the end of the month."
56530,Jigger,2007-04-07 16:10:00,1237,"I see Serra getting beat pretty good, but his hands could get lucky, I guess. Sanchez should beat Kos tonight setting up a possible fight with GSP, in which we will see that he may have the tools to stay in a match with St.Pierre. His undoing will be his lack of smarts. GSPs arsenal is too great right now."
56599,andrey7474,2007-04-07 20:40:00,47, There is nothing bad about that. I asked because the idea about Fedor fighting bear was coming up there pretty frequently.
56651,glirw,2007-04-07 23:06:00,200,"  I've seen both Rampage-Shogun and Rampage-Silva ....  Don't forget that Liddell is a world away from being Silva / Rampage.  Chute Box fighters are waaaaay more aggressive than Jackson. Liddell is a master counterpuncher , and if Jackson plays his cards right , he can school liddell both standing and on the ground.  I see Jackson ground and pounding liddell in the second round."
56778,glirw,2007-04-08 03:13:00,200,"So far , very decent event .  Okami is going to have the middleweight belt with his strong clinch and counterpunching , and for the 2nd time , we are gonna have a champ that can't talk english .  The Kendall fight was great also .  Bring on KOs check ! I hope he gives Diego a beating , but I doubt it .   I love it how Dana's nazi-treatment towards Pride in the past is biting him in the butt , coz when he announced the purchase , nobody knew what the hell Pride is !!   Baaaaad business decision ."
56799,Corey,2007-04-08 04:18:00,355,"That Sanchez-Kos fight sucked. I am kinda impressed by Koscheck though, he fought a smart fight.  GSP-Serra intros going now.  cd."
55592,graftongal,2007-04-05 13:53:00,145,What are everyone's predictions for this Saturday's UFC fight? I am voting for St-Pierre.
55598,tonyb,2007-04-05 14:06:00,1637,St Pierre all the way!! Canadian eh!  Tony
55602,Bitsmith2k,2007-04-05 14:19:00,396,i hope sera doesnt get hurt
55610,graftongal,2007-04-05 14:35:00,145, St-Pierre and Jason MacDonald are my two favs in the UFC. Loiseau was doing really well too until his last couple of matches.    We can only hope!
55617,mdej,2007-04-05 14:49:00,98,Matt Serra should not even be in the octagon with STP.  After the last show STP put on its proven now he's for real.
55620,wildminnow,2007-04-05 14:52:00,27,"well lets just say ""oh Canada"" I hope serra has his life insurance up to date"

55623,tonyb,2007-04-05 14:53:00,1637,Anyone remember Gary Goodridge? he was a beast  I think he was from Barrie but he kinda slipped out of the spotlight.  Tony
55626,Bitsmith2k,2007-04-05 14:57:00,396,"just to play the devils advocate (i already put my vote for gsp in)... serra isnt a can, he went the distance with karo, and penn.. that was a freak shot that he took against shonie.. if georges gets sloppy, he could very well get caught in a sub.. and we'd have a 10-1 underdog win.."
55630,largemouth,2007-04-05 15:00:00,112," the question is, do you put your drink down while you watch?  Go George Go."
55646,Bob Apple,2007-04-05 15:24:00,37,"If Serra wins it will be the biggest upset in UFC history, and maybe in the history of all fighting sports.  They need to put something else on the card than what they have, this fight will be suck. The last fight night was one of the best ever!"
55652,glirw,2007-04-05 15:29:00,200,"I know MMA-Math doesn't work , but this really is a no brainer.  Serra is short, kinda like Sean Sherk ... if you remember that fight , Pierre jabbed the life outta Sherk , and always stayed out of his reach  .  IF Serra manages to close the distance , his wrestling isn't even superior to that of St. Pierre , as you saw in St. Pierre's last fight with Hughes , and we all know Hughes beat Serra before.  If the odds were a bit prettier, I'd put the house on St. Pierre.  What about Guillard vs. Stevenson  ? I'm picking stevenson by ground and pound ."
55663,Bitsmith2k,2007-04-05 15:45:00,396,sokudjou ktfo'ing lil' nog was a huge upset (i think the odds were +1600).. that said serra beating gsp would be huge..  i'm looking forward to guillard / stevenson.. i really have a dislike for guilard so i hope he gets tapped out..
55671,steverowbotham,2007-04-05 15:57:00,1800," My youngest brother trains with Gary, he's still around, but he's under contract with K-1, so thats where he's fighting now.  He's fighting in the k-1 Hawaiian Grand Prix on April 28."
55673,steverowbotham,2007-04-05 15:58:00,1800,No posts yet about Sanchez/Koscheck.  That will be the fight of the  night guaranteed!
55677,Bitsmith2k,2007-04-05 16:04:00,396," if diego wins i agree..  if kos wins, it will be a borefest decision.."

55694,TJQ,2007-04-05 16:42:00,7806,"GSP all the way!!  and a pride fight on Sunday... with Don Frye (one of his fight is my all time favorites) and butterbean..   Heres my all time favorite fight.. it was the first or second time I ever watched MMA  Not much finnesse... but these are some tough buggers....  WARNING - ITS PRETTY GRAPHIC....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KW_FpINwVU  Gotta love YouTube....  Frye returned to PRIDE in February of 2002, facing long-time rival Ken Shamrock at PRIDE 19. After a long, tough battle, Frye pulled out a decision victory. The two hugged after the fight ended, putting an end to their rivalry.    Frye vs. Takayama, PRIDE 21   Just four months after defeating Ken Shamrock, Frye returned to face Japanese pro wrestling legend Yoshihiro Takayama at PRIDE 21. In a fight that many consider to be one of PRIDE's most exciting matches, Frye and Takayama clinched in a ""hockey fight"" pose, each holding the head and hitting, with Takayama finally going to the body after more than a full minute of unrelenting, undefended shots. This would happen three times in the fight, until the referee stopped the bout after Frye mounted Takayama, who was visibly much worse for the wear."
55742,Rob,2007-04-05 18:12:00,467,"No more PRIDE fighting now, all UFC now that they bought them out. see here:  UFC  This will make the UFC alot more interestingand exciting. Like to see Emelianenko take on Cro Crop again but in a UFC match, that would be cool. Jackson and Liddel will be fighting in May so that will be another to watch as well. Go Liddel!!  Rob"

55748,Fishstick,2007-04-05 18:29:00,8,"I'm interested in seeing who is going to be in GSP's corner. GSP has been training with Renzo Gracie in NY for his past couple fights and John Danaher, one of Renzo's top instructors at the main school in NY, has been in his corner. Matt Serra happens to be a Renzo Gracie Balck Belt, I'm curious to see whats going to happen."

The possible Fights were even listed by Dana White at the Press conference. There are some articles on UFC.com if you want to read more!  This is a Great thing for MMA, Also if you watch Dana at the Press conference, its pretty funny what he says about other company's!"
55758,Bitsmith2k,2007-04-05 18:57:00,396,"the fertitta's actually bought pride, so technically it wasnt the ufc, or zuffa inc..   and as grizz said, they're 'supposed' to be operating as seperate entities, but since all ownership is on the same page, the dream fights are supposed to happen..  there's actually been quite a bit of rumbings goin on in the forums that ufc are going to announce big nog. as an aquisition tonite.. which would be really cool.. i also think on the pride side of things, if this is true, it opens up for a Barnett / Fedor fight.."
