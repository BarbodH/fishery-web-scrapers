57153,bucktail,2007-04-08 23:37:00,1857,Since we seem to be going backwards I was wondering if people would post there ice reports as opposed to there open water reports. I was at Quinte and it was all open yesterday but all of the coves and protected areas have refrozen. Also heard that alot of Simcoes open water has re frozen. Going to be a late ice out for sure. May 1st Geo Bay openor may need an auger in places with this forecast.
57158,fishindevil,2007-04-08 23:42:00,6254,"Man this weather really sucks thats for sure,some of the smaller creeks and rivers are freezing back up to here in southern ontario ,port darlington boat launch is still frozen all around the marina,i thought about maybe going out of the harbour and trolling for bows all around the breakwall,well thats not going to happen...so i hear what you mean...im getting real  ancy....cheers"
57163,ccmtcanada,2007-04-08 23:46:00,7971,Maybe all the people still ice fishing have fallen thru...and that's why there are no reports from them....
57168,Clampet,2007-04-08 23:49:00,1947," Wall, when they stop fallin' thru, we'll rest assured it is safe once agin. "

57249,Mike the Pike,2007-04-09 01:48:00,3421, I was in Northbay this weekend stopped at a local bait shop to try and renew my ontario fishing licence.The owner of the bait shop told people were going out saturday on Trout lake ice fishing.From what I could see Trout Lake was frozen solid and it looked safe to me.MTP
57254,fishboy,2007-04-09 02:04:00,550,Any ice-out/refreezing reports from  Minden/Haliburton?
57255,irishfield,2007-04-09 02:05:00,26272,Yep...they're still walking on Lake Temagami Mike. Probably some still driving on it!  Ice doesn't generally go out till first week of May. Last year April 21st was the earliest in recorded history for a clear lake.
57263,GbayGiant,2007-04-09 02:19:00,1780,"Got ice here on inshore Gbay, I threw a rock up in the air and it went though the ice today, so there's only like 2 inches, 2 nice warm windy days will do it, but the wallies are usually here spawning by no later than the 15 th so it could be a little late this year."
