57288,holdfast,2007-04-09 04:04:00,1813,"Roy I'm afraid your wrong.  they are all Canadian Citizens. Funny thing though, I didnt see too many so called new Canadains amongst the fighting troops unless they joined to to challenge traditition and then quit.  Although I was born in the USA, I still had to pledge an allegiance to the Queen at the time I lived 20 of 21 years in Canada. ( Had no Canadian Citizen papers)  Now for the Hockey.  I really hate the way the game has become to the Canadian teams.  I partly blame Bettman for that.  The game between Toronto and Montreal was pathetic with the penalty calls.  The ref played a key role in that game.  As a Montreal fan, I'm really disappointed on the way that team is being managed.  They are too small and easily intimidated.  That team has 14 or 15 Europeans and they play like the Europeans.  Most of them when they do attempt to hit they turn their back on the Opponent vice stand them up.  Don't get me wrong, there are three that play the game the way we played growing up.  Souray, Komisarek and Bouillon.  A Western Boy and 2 Americans.  As far as the rest, they play like theyre in the Quebec or European League. There is a difference in leagues.  Meaning, pass the puck as soon as you get it, when in the corners don't hang on too long, and if you think you might get hit go down or get rid of the puck.  What makes me mad, is how long they kept Brisbois, and now they will probably keep Markov over Souray.  As far as Koivu is concerned, sure he is talented, has guts, but he is too small as well as the rest of his team mates.  Maybe I'm wrong, but when I played hockey and the game was chippy, the Capt always seem to lead the way.  Usually he was a scrapper and gutsy, didn't fear no one, and usually was as tough as the other teams Capt or tough guys.  Yea I do like the hits, the fights, as well as the rest of the action.  Cant stand all the pushing, shoving, and mouthing off once the refs get in between.  And the penalties, you cant even blow on an opponent without getting called.  And what about all the Dives, pathetic. The game is turning into a kinder, gentler, kiss game.  Reminds me of the European leagues that Haley Wickenheiser played on."
57325,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-09 11:19:00,0," Funny how people see what they want to see, I saw Coliaccova interfere with Koivu without a call, he previously fell in the fence without any penalties from Koivu.  It's also funny that the dominating team has 2 more penalties then the team spending the majority of the game in their side of the ice."
57327,jughead,2007-04-09 11:27:00,92,"Can't we all just enjoy the magnificent Sens and throw our collective Canadian support behind them?  (sits back with coffe and awaits the barrage of choker jokes, euro captain jokes, etc. etc. etc.)"
57331,Northhunter,2007-04-09 12:09:00,214," 24 of 30 NHL teams had more PP opportunities at home than on the road.  25 of 30 NHL teams were shorthanded less at home than on the road.  The officiating almost always goes to the home team. That seems to hold especially true when in Toronto. I was told that in Saturday's game one ref made every single call ??  Going by memory here, but in the past couple seasons the Leafs have won more than a couple games against Montreal late in the 3rd or in overtime on power play goals"
57480,charlied,2007-04-09 19:12:00,584, No support here...even if the make the cup finals the will lose to the West...there are to many  strong teams in the west..... GO CANUCKS!!!!
57512,specktacklure,2007-04-09 20:51:00,56,No toughness in the west.Give it up Charlied they gave away their heart when they gave away Bertuzzi.East dominates look at the standings !! Pens don't stand a chance.This the Sens year.They have the goaltending and now the experience.Any great team has to lose in the playoffs before they can win....remember the Oilers ? Lost in the finals to the Islanders then the next year Gretzky and the boys went on a four year run !!! GO SENS GO
57559,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-09 22:22:00,0,Ya as always the west suck. Yes there are a couple of good teams but the rest are bad. And it takes playing good teams throughout the year to stay sharp. I bet if you looked at the record East vs West there would be a big difference even if some of the eastern teams get to play after 10 pm on a lot of those western trips.  Take the top 10 teams in the league and you'll find but a couple or 3 from the west.
57564,camillj,2007-04-09 22:24:00,1988,I think Ontario should call a referendum .... wouldnt that be something
57567,bigfish1965,2007-04-09 22:25:00,3382,They are all fodder for the mighty Sabres.
57578,Roy,2007-04-09 22:42:00,13728,Canadiens and Leafs did it right. They basically get the same pay as everyone else but now they can fish and relax while others risk serious injury.
57579,irishfield,2007-04-09 22:44:00,26272,"Call it Early Retirement, eh Roy !! LOL"
57614,charlied,2007-04-10 00:07:00,584," WOW...you need to look at the standing again....west teams have more points....seventh place in the west has 104 points...and in the East...93.  3 teams in the west over 110 points....east ..1.  if Ottawa was in the west they would be seventh, and the sixth, seventh and eighth place teams in the east would not even have made the playoffs in the west...in my eyes looking at the standings I would say point wise....like you told me too  they look pretty strong.   You are just biast and only look in the SENS view.  this bashing of the leafs could go on forever....but this started out as a congrats to the leafs for winning there last game and of course the Sens fans turn it into a leaf bashing ordeal.....go get your own damn post!"
57724,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-10 01:54:00,0,The horror this turned into a hockey post.  Teams in the west have more points because a lot of them suck. Look at the bottom of the pile in the east 5 teams were battling for 8th place and in the west well you can say 2 but actually the Flames were in 8th for weeks.
57733,ribak,2007-04-10 01:57:00,19,"How can you say the west sucks?? Detroit, Anaheim, even vancouver and dallas always perform well...sens and sabres are probably better because of the new nhl made for quicker and younger players, but you cant look at stats to say whether a team is good or not, look at edmonton last year....regular season is completely different from playoffs....unfortunately all the hope is left on the raptors!! GO RAPS"
57765,Northhunter,2007-04-10 02:50:00,214," Standings and points are two entirely different things. Because the western teams have more points does not mean they are better. They play in a different conference. Toronto played the other 4 teams in their division 32 times. Eight against Buffalo, 8 against Montreal, etc. and vice versa. Did they ever see Anaheim? Dallas? Did Vancouver play Philly? Montreal? Maybe once in 82 games.  Western teams went past regulation 134 times. Eastern teams: 147. If you look at the 9-12th seeded teams in each conference they combine for 355pts (East) vs. 320pts (West). 35 points is a pretty big difference. The stats would support that while the Eastern Conf. is more closely matched and more competitive, the playoff teams in the west were simply feeding off the weaker non-playoff teams. There are some very skilled teams in the west, but only one can make it to the finals and they better be damn afraid of who comes out of the east, whoever that may be.  And please drop the ""Leafs Bashing"" thing. Specktacklure's post did not mention the Leafs once, but because he's a Sens fan you felt compelled to bring it back up?? There may be a few Sens/Habs followers giving some ribbing, but that's only because we get it 10x worse from ""Leaf Nation / Center of the Universe"" about 300 days a year."
57781,kennyman,2007-04-10 03:23:00,737,Don't overlook Detroit or Anaheim. They're as good as the Sens or Sabres on any given night.
57792,charlied,2007-04-10 04:34:00,584,Thats what I have been trying to say but to many norrow minded hockey fans!
57060,irishfield,2007-04-08 21:42:00,26272,Yep...I think maybe Paul should call Montreal and see if they can get a group rate on the course....
57062,Tacklebuster,2007-04-08 21:43:00,303,Congratulations?  I would say thats counting your chicks before they hatched.  Go Islanders!  Leafs/Leaves don't deserve it.

57072,Dondorfish,2007-04-08 21:58:00,1000,Well - its not over yet for the leafs - New Jersey scored with under 1 second left to tie the game up - gone upstairs to see if it counts   Don
57083,98Fahrenheit,2007-04-08 22:23:00,108,Well .... guess I don't have to bring a radio to listen to the playoffs now when heading to go fishing!  Paul .... I believe Myrtle Beach has nice golf courses!  hahahah
57100,Tacklebuster,2007-04-08 22:51:00,303,Congrats Islander Fans!
57111,Raf,2007-04-08 23:10:00,3495,The only thing that 'sucks' about the leafs not making it is the fact that they almost made it and their draft pick will be mid-rnd 1/

57135,Dondorfish,2007-04-08 23:27:00,1000,"I know what ya mean Dan - but with the Habs out, and the Leafs out , maybe we can put all that energy into fishing and posting!   Don"
57143,DanTheMan,2007-04-08 23:30:00,257,"If spring could ever get here, maybe I will.  But the way its going, we will have ice here until May"
57147,Northhunter,2007-04-08 23:32:00,214,"I've been quiet since last night for obvious reasons (my freakin' team lost!!  lol). I said I was worried the game was in Toronto and in the end it may have been the difference. Seven power plays to Montreal's 4, and three 5 on 3's in what was the most important game of the year. Koivu's call early in the 3rd was tough to take - one hand on the stick reaching for the puck and Wellwood dives. Kubina knocked a net off as well.  I can't bring myself to cheer for another Canadian team just because they are Canadian. Of the six I am only fond of two (Montreal and Edmonton), and they are both out. I'd like to see what kind of damage Minnesota will do. Will probably keep an eye on Dallas as well. Dallas - Vancouver should be a good one!"
57152,Dondorfish,2007-04-08 23:37:00,1000,     I know what ya mean - I still have my ice gear out - might need it for the May 24 weekend   Don
57239,carll2,2007-04-09 01:09:00,443,please let the ice melt so i can leave already.. see what damnn hockey does to all of us!!
57246,Mike the Pike,2007-04-09 01:25:00,3421,Ok I am a little too late for the congrats for the leafs but Congrats to you leaf fans eventhough it was temporary.I know the habs have got first dibs on the many golf courses.  Now enough said bring on the spring and let the fishing begin
57250,holdfast,2007-04-09 01:55:00,1813,"As far as my prediction is concerned, Sundin, Nasland, Alfredson,Koivu, are all ging to enjoy family life somwhere near or in the land of volvo and ABBA.  Do you guys really think they can get their noses dirty to lead a stanley cup team.  They got nothing on the Brindamours, Sakics, Yzermans.  Maybe Calgarys Captain will show how to lead a Canadian team.  Ottawa, Mtl, Toronto, Vancouver should get their acts togeather and stop employing so many europeans"
57267,Northhunter,2007-04-09 02:22:00,214,"Don't be knockin' Koivu.  His rookie training camp they had to tell him not to hit his teammates so hard. He's only 5'10"". We all know about the cancer ordeal - missed 80 games, came back and they clinched a playoff spot on his return. I believe that was the year he lead them to an upset Over Boston after being down 3-1. The team was on the way to a 3-1 lead but folded last year after he was taken out in game 4 of the Carolina series by a high stick. Despite the blind spot it caused and playing a defensive system under Carbo, he put up the best point total of his career, including 15 points in the final 8 games. He's stated he would play a season without a paycheck if it meant a chance at the cup with the Habs.  Yeah, dump him. He sucks"
57271,holdfast,2007-04-09 02:29:00,1813,But he is sooo fragile
57275,Roy,2007-04-09 02:44:00,13728,"Our armed forces are made up almost entirely of Europeans.  So, I guess you're right....very fragile."
57278,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-09 02:46:00,212," With the utmost respect, Sakic and Yzerman looked to their left, right and behind them and saw all stars and hall of famers all around.  Including Forseberg, Lindstrom, Hasek, Datsuk, etc etc etc.  Sundin looks around and sees Andropov, Pono.....ky, Ian White with Brian McCabe and did we forget five hole playing net who could not stop beach ball when the game is on the line.  Also Sundin managed to captain his team to a gold medal in 06 while Sakic was the captain of Canada.  Don't get me wrong, I love the guys you refer to but they did have a little help including help from Europeans.  Given what Sundin has played with over the years and to put up the stats he has, this city should be grateful.  He also did it with a smile on his face and never publicly criticizing the city or its pathetic management.  He has earned my respect.  Can't comment on the other guys you mentioned."
56798,xrap,2007-04-08 04:15:00,683,Sabres are done if leafs are in
56801,Headhunter,2007-04-08 04:31:00,5703,"While admittedly entertaining, I thought the game was a really good display of Junior A goaltending, by both guys! Neither team has the goaltending it takes to go anywhere in the playoffs, so it's just another year of disappontment for this long suffering Leaf Fan! HH"
56807,taper,2007-04-08 04:49:00,611,I am a Leafs fan but have to agree if they make the play offs there going to get there butts kicked if the play like they have been.
56811,charlied,2007-04-08 05:04:00,584,"true but at least we may get 4 more games of leaf hockey.  I watch almost every game thats on tv, not just the leafs...so I just love hockey in general.  I just wanna watch more leaf games.  If they play Buffalo and lose oh well.  I am not bitter towards the leafs like alot of leaf fans are.  So what if people think it was a dissapointing season and hearing all the guys ticked off cause of management...doesn't bother me one bit...they are paid to entertain the fans and as a fan I was entertained for most of the season.  So my hat goes off to all the teams that made the playoffs....it was one heck of a year of hockey and alot of high scoring teams to boot!"
56812,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-08 05:07:00,181,"GO LEAFS GO! I'm watching the NJ game, they better win!"
56823,SlowPoke,2007-04-08 07:18:00,2984," You'll make a good Senators fan some day, just go easy on the cheese with that whine.   Leafs lost more then they won, Habs won more then they lost. I'm not sure why people (you're not alone) fail to consider the OTL's when quoting a percentage record. I hear it all the time on the radio... regular time or overtime, it's still a loss. Yes, the Hab's killed the Leafs in OT and I was sure it was going to come back to bite 'em.... i.e. Leafs win in overtime, Hab's still advance due to the extra point.   I agree completely... I'd love to see ten minutes of 4 on 4, I'd be exhausted just watching it."
56885,bucktail,2007-04-08 14:08:00,1857,"The Penguins vs Senators is going to be a GREAT first round matchup, not a SEns or Pitts fan but that is going to be the series I watch...Lots of offensive talent in that one. Heatly,Spezza,Crosby,Malkin  etc......   AWESOME!! If the Leafs make it they will get smoked by Buffalo..... Hell they got smoked by Buffalo when Buffalo basically played the Rochester Americans due to injuries earlier in the year."
56891,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-04-08 14:21:00,0,"That was a great game. The leafs have heart. Never gave up. The Canadian fans must have been laughing at 5-3. I dont think they are laughing anymore.  Islanders are playing well but if Brodeur plays, they are done.  Calgary is in but I think the Candian teams to watch are Ottawa and Vancouver. I like the fact Ottawa added Roberts and I like the Vancouver goaltending.  Buffalo has a good chance to win the cup."

As for the makebelieafs they only have a few more hours before they book their tee times.  As for last night's game I only got to watch some of the third period and it sure looked like I predicted that the fix was in. Two 5 on 3 in the first minutes of the third period and the rest of the period was played in the leafs end where white shirts were tripped pulled interfered with ect ect but no calls.  It's just sad that we'll have one less Canadian team in the playoffs, thank you Beteman."

Man I love it when the non-leaf fans talk crap.  So many leaf haters on here...whats the deal...this is a congrats post to the leafs not lets jump on the wagon and find another reason to bash them.

57030,steve_paul,2007-04-08 20:12:00,658," Enough talk of the reffing fix.  If you watched the 3rd you saw the uncalled slew foot by Koivu on Coliaccova, the uncalled cross check from behind on Deveraux, the uncalled 6 Canadiens on the ice near the bench on a bad change.  Leafs had 2 more PP than the Habs and made them count - hardly a fix."

56766,muskymatt,2007-04-08 02:43:00,2608,It was a bonus for the leafs to have an extra 2 players in stripped shirts on their taem ....the advantage of being at the centre of the universe... I hope buffalo pound the crap out of em ...that is if the Ilses don't eliminate them tomorrow..  Matt the leaf hater  
56767,xrap,2007-04-08 02:44:00,683,"  Last time I checked being  games over 500 is a winning record. And the reason why so many overtime loses is because leafs sucked in overtime, just remeber how many times montreal won in the over time or shootout.   LEAFS ALL THE WAY GO LEAFS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
56769,fishdawg,2007-04-08 02:45:00,912," I agree - but i dont mind the shootout , but make it 10 minutes of OT first of 4 on 4, most games should be able to end by then....  then have a shoot out if still tied, but eliminate the single point  winner gets 2, loser NOTHING"
56770,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-08 02:55:00,212,"Even though i am extremely disappointed with Leafs management, I think this team way over achieved for their level of talent.  Good on them.  Islanders will still be playing a AHL team tomorrow and Leafs season will be over.  With that said, last I checked before they introduced the OT and the single point for the loss there was no OT and it was considered a tie.  In essance Leafs poor OT record worked to Montreals good OT record.  Can't blame the point system for that one.  Leafs would have made it if OT did not exist."
56773,xrap,2007-04-08 03:06:00,683,"LOL, it's so funny how when the habs were ahead of the leafs you guys were cheering and saying your gonna kill the leafs and now when we beats you the excuses are already starting. Leafs are only ahead of us because of those cheap overtime loses   If the islanders win tommrow then oh well.. that's hockey. But atleast we can say we went out by kicking your ass ahahah GO LEAFS GO!!!!"
56775,charlied,2007-04-08 03:08:00,584,"Islanders playing an AHL team tomorrow......WHAT....New Jersey is by far an AHL team.  Yes Brodeur is a big reason the won alot of games this season but they have some pretty talented guys out there.  I hardly think a team that that has 106 points this season in the NHL is an AHL class team, plus Jersey has tonight off and Islanders played today!  Can't believe someone thinks Jersey is an AHL calibre team! WOW"
56777,bigfish1965,2007-04-08 03:13:00,3382,It matters not. Whomever gets 8th place is just fodder for the Sabres. GO SABRES!
56779,xrap,2007-04-08 03:14:00,683,  I don't think  he means jersey is a ahl team its jsut the jersey will be resting thier stars and playing the ahl rookies
56780,Dondorfish,2007-04-08 03:15:00,1000,Charlied : think what they meant by an AHL team was that they will sit out their stars as they don't need the points so why risk injury to thier talent that they will need healthy for the playoffs.   Don
56782,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-08 03:19:00,212," No, they are a very good team.  That is not what i mean. They have nothing to play for, can't advance or go back.  Last thing they want is to have one or two of their top players go down to an injury against an Islanders team that will be playing very hard for something.  Brodeur will sit and their top guys will have their playing min reduces.  The 3rd and 4th liners will get more playing time and a few guys who are on the bubble will be getting a look prior to the playoffs start by the NJ coaching staff. They have no reason to compete in this game and given the high intensity of NHL hockey, if one team is competing and the other is riding out the season, my guess is NY wins and wins big.  I may be wrong but as a Leaf fan I hope not.  I like the team but they do not have depth or talent and will get smoked by Buffalo and I don't want management to have any reason to keep Ferguson.  This guy is as bad a GM as they come.  Just look at his record.  Show me something that worked well that he did.  I will show you many moves that were total busts."
56784,danc,2007-04-08 03:20:00,4677,"Al this drama for a team that hasn't actually made the playoffs yet. And if they do, they'll get their butts kicked in the first round anyways. And for the record, I'm a Leafs fan. Or at least I try to be."
56785,charlied,2007-04-08 03:20:00,584,"who knows what they will do...but the season series is 5-1 for Jersey!  I don't see them sitting all or most there top players.  Oh ya Sabres suck...LOL  Kidding.  If leafs play bad defensively against the sabres they will more than likely sweep!  They need to win 2 in Buffalo thou.  Well the Flames are in now and take the final 8t place spot in the West...good for them, nice to see another canadian team in the playoffs!"
56791,kennyman,2007-04-08 03:35:00,737,"Classy move Tracker. I have to say if not a beautiful game it certainly was entertaining! I was on the edge of my seat more than once. Montreal versus Toronto to get into the playoffs. It doesn't get much better than that!It could have gone either way, but the Leafs really did deserve the win. It's not like Montreal didn't have any time to come back.  The Leafs just held them back. By the way,where was Kovalev tonight?I'd like to say I was sorry we eliminated Les Canadien,but I'm not. All the ribbing we Leaf fans took is only equalled by the whining Habs fans are doing now! If the Leafs get in the playoffs do I think we can beat the Sabres? No, I wouldn't bet my house on it ..... but I'll sure to whooping and hollering for a couple more days . Thanks again Tracker for the well wishing. That really was a classy move. Sorry I couldn't follow suit."
