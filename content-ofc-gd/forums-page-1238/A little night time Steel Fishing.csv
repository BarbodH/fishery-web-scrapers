56888,ccmtcanada,2007-04-08 14:15:00,7971,"Bly and I went out last night to try our luck at night fishing again.  Bly pulled one out in the dark last week, so we figured it was possible to do so!  We found a nice spot and began our fishing.  It was very cold last night...flurries....and when the wind picked up it sent shivers down our spines.  Long story short...the steelies weren't hitting anything we put out there, but my adrenaline did get pumped for a short while.  My float went down and I set the hook and pulled in my very first sucker.    Had to take a picture of it...since it's my first.  I was a little disappointed to find that they are not one of the species for OFAH angler awards or the OFC Tourney...LOL  Anyhow, hopefully I'll try out my luck today or tomorrow."

56899,The Urban Fisherman,2007-04-08 14:57:00,2050,"I've eaten them before.... they aren't bad except they have alot of tiny little bones in them that are IMPOSSIBLE to get out....heard if you score them every inch or so the oil will get in and dissolve the tiny bones but sure as poop we were pickin' bones out of our teeth all night!!!!  Congrats on the new species!  Cheers, UF"
