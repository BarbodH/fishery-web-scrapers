56588,cityfisher,2007-04-07 20:14:00,959,GO HABS !! leafs dont even deserve to be in the playoffs  !!
56590,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-07 20:16:00,0,"Only way makebeleafs win tonight is if the fix is in. The NHL might want to Leafs in the playoffs over the Habs. Lord knows it been done before. Just watch the refs, especially is Fraser is out there."
56593,Jigger,2007-04-07 20:31:00,1237,"Yah, Fraser has been a real blessing for the leafs in the past hasn't he? I guess those kind of comments are expected from a Sens fan. Envy has its place everywhere. I thought Sens fans would want the Leafs to limp in so that the ""mighty"" Senators would vanquish them like they have in all, No... some, NO... ONE playoff matchup.  I'm sure if Sundin had a Spezza or a killer like Heatly on his wing the Leafs would be a better team, but he doesn't  so..."
56595,Jigger,2007-04-07 20:33:00,1237,"Roberts will give the Sens fits again, so if the Sens do win against Pittsburg, they can always pretend they beat the Leafs when it counted."
56607,charlied,2007-04-07 21:03:00,584,"Sens won't beat the pens...no way!  Pens in 6 games.  as for the montreal fan saying Toronto don't deserve to be in the playoffs...neither does montreal....remember they are only 1 more point up on them and have way more talented players, so you do the math!  I agree bench steen and put in O'neill."
56618,Northhunter,2007-04-07 21:39:00,214, If this 3 point system wasn't in place the Leafs would be 6 or 7 points behind Montreal and out of the running.
56679,Jigger,2007-04-07 23:52:00,1237,Doesn't look like the Habs belong on an AHL rink so far. Nevermind the playoffs. Hope the Leafs can keep it up. Raycroft needs to stand on his head from here on in. GO LEAFS GO!!!
56697,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-08 00:21:00,212,"Leaf Ownership + Ferguson + (Raycroft, Kabina, McCabe and a bunch of other 4th liners) = Golf Season."
56698,Jigger,2007-04-08 00:22:00,1237,4-3 Habs... Tide turns awful fast.
56706,Northhunter,2007-04-08 00:51:00,214,5-4 after two. Habs just sat back and waited for a break in the storm
56737,steve_paul,2007-04-08 01:42:00,658, They musta put their umbrellas away too soon  Go Devils Go
56740,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-08 01:45:00,212,"Yup, just like i said earlier.  Islanders will be playing the NJ AHL team tomorrow.  At least it ended on a high note.  Only thing left is the shine the clubs, sharpen the hooks and fire Ferguson in the off season."
56741,urbanangler1990,2007-04-08 01:45:00,933,"OHHHH YEAHHHHHHHHH!!!  WHOOOOHOOOOOOOO!!!!  6-5  WOW WOW WOW!!  all in islanders hands now... raycroft, u gotta love him"
56745,bbnotty,2007-04-08 01:47:00,93,"wow, go leafs. or should i say go devils.  bb"
56835,Chris,2007-04-08 11:18:00,405,na na nana na naaaaa hey hey good night
57165,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-08 23:47:00,212, That last second goal was just the almighty (most likely a Wings fan this year) playing some final mind games with us hopeless leaf fanatics.  Can't say i did not see it coming but fell for it anyway.
57203,charlied,2007-04-09 00:24:00,584,ya they tried...oh well.  At least we get to watch what i think is gonna be the best play-off hockey in a long time.  Some awsome teams and so many good players this year!
56453,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-04-07 12:31:00,0,"Its gonna be a great game for sure. Although Montreal has been playing well in the last few games, Montreal does not play as well away. Leafs are going to have the fans behind them.  Hopefully we dont see any stupid penalties for the leafs or Montreal will capitalize with their power play.  I agree with the comment about McCabe....He is not worth a cent over 1.5 mil....If I were the coach, I would bench this guy every time we had the lead(even put in Belak to clear the rebounds or move players out of the way).  Raycroft is also not the greatest goalie and gives up too many rebounds that our defencemen should be clearing. The odds of the leafs winning the cup this year, does not loook good.  The rest of the team looks pretty  Whats really sad is that 2 teams like the Leafs and the Canadiens may not even make the playoffs this year. With the amount of fans and revenue these 2 teams have, they should at least be Stanley cup contenders. Especially now that the Canadian dollar is strengthening. The high American dollar was really hurting the Canadian teams, that couldn't afford the big salaries in American dollars. They should make the NHL like the NFL, where all teams share the profits.  May the best team win. I say its going to be a nailbiter to the end!"
56463,Northhunter,2007-04-07 13:02:00,214," The majority of the team was infected. The training staff had never seen anything like it. It's one thing to have a couple guys on IR, it's another to have a different player or two out every game for an extended period of time because the majority of your roster has a ""bug"". If 1-3 professional hockey players in peak physical condition (these guys are machines with access to some of the best medical attention offered) are sick enough to not dress for a game, how many are on the ice playing because they have to and aren't much better off? I don't think it's a coincidence that after the flu bug left the team they got healthy and started winning again."
56503,walleyejigger,2007-04-07 14:53:00,876,"i have said this before and will say it again, at the end of the season conferences should no longer exist, top seed plays 16th and so on, then anything could happen (playoff matchups) we will never have a chance to see toronto vs. montreal in a stanley cup final and that's a SHAME.  this last game of the season between these 2 teams is as good as it gets, there's more hype for this game than the stanley cup final ever will, i would pay a pretty pennie to attend, i can only imagine what scallped tickets are going for,  anyways..... GO HABS GO  if the habs don't win it won't be the end of the world, as neither team REALLY deserves to make it, i just hope its a great game and very close, back and forth all night, it will probably be the highest viewing CBC has had in a long long time, i know i'll be watching   HIP HIP HUET  welcome back crystal ball"
56509,Puckhead,2007-04-07 15:11:00,377,"Nail biter tonight for sure.  With the islanders game on at 1:00pm, I hope that there out by game time.  I hate the fact that a tie doesn""t help.  It would have been something if it was decided by a shootout."
56513,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-07 15:14:00,212,"Here is my take on what happens tonight.  Leafs will win, because they don't want to start the golf season on a loosing note and they get to continue to play mind games with all of us.  We as deranged Leaf fans will get an extra 24 hours to plan the parade route only to realize that the game they needed to win was on Thursday night.  That was when our beloved hockey team was shooting with golf clubs instead of hockey sticks and thinking how to get through the next 60 min without breaking a finger nail or hurting their golf grip.  NY Islanders will sweep their next two games and the Leafs and Habs will be playing skins in Florida and fishing for Snook on Monday.  Come to think of it, if I was Sundin looking to my left and my right and then watching McCabe behind me, thinking that this is what I have to carry into the playoffs, then early April golf and fishing sounds pretty good.  When was the last time this guy went some 10 games without a goal.  Can you say this thing can't finish soon enough.  By the way, I think straight up University is the best Cup route should the Islanders manage to pull a Leafs and give it away."
56514,Puckhead,2007-04-07 15:24:00,377,^hahaha....  I don't think the isles have a shot.  Winning 3 in a row now is tough at the best of times but 3 in 4 nights is near impossible.   Let's just hope they loose this afternoon so it's all settled by the time the puck drops tonight.
56528,Jigger,2007-04-07 15:57:00,1237,"If theres anytime that the guns have to come out its tonight. They can't afford to let the habs get any kind of momentum. IMO, they should sit Steen and put Green or O'Neill back in the lineup. Sundin needs to make tonight his night. Tucker has to PLAY tonight and Raycroft needs to not let any bad goals. Pretty simple, I guess. Should be a doozy. GO LEAFS GO!!!"
56535,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-07 16:31:00,0,Funny how people even think the makebeliefs have a chance at making the playoffs.  I'll be chearing for the winning team tonight.  GO SENS GO.
56539,Puckhead,2007-04-07 16:54:00,377,"^You almost had me there, then I realized your a Sens fan...   Your opinion has now been rendered irrelevant.    :D"
56544,Roy,2007-04-07 17:10:00,13728,HAHAHAHAHAHA
56546,98Fahrenheit,2007-04-07 17:17:00,108,"Dubielewicz  versus  Niittymaki.  2min gone in the first .... still 0-0  NYI - 3:36, M. Satan power-play goal (M. Bergeron, J. Blake)  End of First Period:  NY Islanders 1, Philadelphia 0.  Shots Flyers 11-Islanders 8"
56563,walleyejigger,2007-04-07 18:24:00,876,3-0 islanders half way thru 2nd  are the leafs done before they even get a chance to start  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
55888,darsky,2007-04-06 01:06:00,586,Pretty amazing to think that after 81 games-the whole shebang comes down to their very last game of the season. I for one will be cheering for Les Canadiens and have a place reserved on my sofa at 7pm on Sat nite. I hope it will be stimulating hockey.
55890,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-06 01:12:00,212,It will be painful if they make it.  A very frustrating team to cheer for.  Look completely disorganized tonight.  Would almost wish it ended on Saturday so i can focus on baseball and fishing.
55892,easton13th,2007-04-06 01:15:00,371,I am so confused.... My emotions are going crazy.   I just don't understand...Saturday night I will be pacing more than I am now....  Go HABS Go!!!!!
55893,ccmtcanada,2007-04-06 01:17:00,7971,"I think I'm gonna go fishing and NOT watch the game.  My heart will not be able to take it if the Leafs lose....plus if I catch a fish or two, I'll feel better that the night wasn't a complete waste of time...LOL"
55896,love2fishhave2work,2007-04-06 01:23:00,212,"2-2, we are going to the cup baby"

55905,holdfast,2007-04-06 01:50:00,1813,check the stats before crying edit
55906,fliptheslop,2007-04-06 01:50:00,112,I wish the Habs and Leafs could both make the playoffs that way evryone of you habs and leaf fans could have your hearts brokin when they get crushed in the first round GO FLAMES GO
55909,darsky,2007-04-06 02:04:00,586,not really talking about stats. And I am hardly crying
55910,98Fahrenheit,2007-04-06 02:05:00,108,even if the leafs win .... they have to rely on sunday's game between the devils and isles ..... and hope that brodeur will win it.
55921,GbayGiant,2007-04-06 02:18:00,1780,Go Raptors.
55922,bassmaster4,2007-04-06 02:22:00,801,i hate to say it but the leafs look like they are out of it a win on saturday in regulation would put them in but the islanders are a team who doesnt look liek they will choke from wat ive seen tonight leafs played bruatl the last 15 of the third
55924,bassmaster4,2007-04-06 02:27:00,801,  brodeur wont be playing most likely considering new jersey will be resting their guys up for the playoffs all teh big guys for nj will be sitting out and theyll put the crap holes out isles look to be taking eigth spot and they got philly staurday its gonna take a miracle for philly to beat them    GO LEAFS GO  hopefully leafs will amke it altrhough they dont have much of a chance now
55925,easton13th,2007-04-06 02:31:00,371,Devils have a back up goalie?

55975,charlied,2007-04-06 05:11:00,584,Brodeur will play...they will want him to add to most wins in a season in NHL history!
56000,snoil,2007-04-06 11:15:00,139,I don't think Brodeur will play either.Why risk injury just to add to a record he all ready owns.Soon enough he will have the all time shutout record and many more.Hopefully the Flyers beat the Islanders tomorrow afternoon.Expect the unexpected.
56002,Moosebunk,2007-04-06 12:09:00,3970,Islanders are going to spoil it all.
