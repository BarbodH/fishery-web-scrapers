57825,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-10 11:18:00,181,Is this tournament mostly boat fishing or shoreline fishing?  Bryce
57828,xrap,2007-04-10 11:24:00,683,"  Pretty much shoreline dominated, most of the fishing is done off the main pier in Dover."
57830,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-10 11:27:00,181,Thanks xrap! My parents have been talking about getting a boat for the summer. As much as Baseball and Hockey will have me busy    there is still some time to go out on a boat! I will talk to my dad on going to this tournament. Sounds like a fun tournament. Thanks.  Bryce
57831,BryceBurzynski,2007-04-10 11:28:00,181,"One more question, Is the main pier the pier right beside the beach?  Bryce"
