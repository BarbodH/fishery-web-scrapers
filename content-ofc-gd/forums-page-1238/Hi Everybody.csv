56652,Douger,2007-04-07 23:07:00,116,"I'm new to OFC so I thought I'd introduce myself.   My name is Doug and I'm a newbie steelheader.  I grew up in London, fished a lot around Owen Sound with my dad, and after years of wanting to pick up the rod again was introduced to steelheading by a friend from work.  I'm now totally obsessed.  Many thanks to Bly and Cliff for a great day on Oshawa Creek yesterday, and to Scott (CanadianCopper) for advice on beginner float rod.  Sincerely, Doug"

56881,Douger,2007-04-08 13:52:00,116,Thanks for all the kind replies.  The avatar pic is from Vietnam.  My wife was born there but raised in TO.  We went there for 5 weeks this past summer and had an amazing time.  We spent some great time with her extended family and toured most of the country from south to north.  -d-
