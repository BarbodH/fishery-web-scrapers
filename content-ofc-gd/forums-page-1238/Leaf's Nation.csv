57348,RobHall,2007-04-09 13:20:00,261,"  Good Luck Beerman.  As a Sens Fan....I agree with you with your prediction.  As much as i would like to see the Sens beat the Pens.  I think it will be a long series with the Pens winning the 7th game in OT.  Gary Roberts will also play a big role, in once again ending the Sens season early.  Then the real 2nd guessing will begin.  Muckler will be raked over the coals, for not acquiring Gary Roberts at the trade dealine.  The reason is plan and simple...he didn't want to sacrifice the teams future (Patrick Eaves) and overall long term regular season success for someone who he believed was not going to to be an impact player for the Sens in the Playoffs.  It's clear to me that Muckler is more conerned with long term regular season success and making the playoffs every year, then with sacrificing some of the Sens youth for a chance at a real Cup run.  You can tell that i really wanted the Sens to pick up Roberts, because i believe he has a few more good playoffs games in him.  I hope i'm wrong on this obviously, but i just can't shake the feeling that the Pens are a team of destiny this year.  How far they go is anyones guess.  Go Sens Go!!!!   FOTB "
57349,specktacklure,2007-04-09 13:22:00,56,If the Leafs had made the playoffs and the Sens had not you would have seen what a true bad hockey fan is. All you will here now is more whinning from Leaf nation.You have to play a whole season to make the playoffs not one game.Blown 4 goal lead against Buffalo .........ouch bet that hurts now !!! Trophy muskie you hit it right on the head !!! Champion is definitely coming from the east because you west coatsers are light weights.Lets see how well Pittsburgh does without the shootout when they actually have to score a real goal to win.Those young kids are going to fold like a house of cards GO SENS GO !!!
57350,specktacklure,2007-04-09 13:25:00,56,Jansens hit on Kaberle now that was priceless !!!
57353,RobHall,2007-04-09 13:32:00,261,"  Munchies...............$2.50  Case of Beer.........$25  Big comfy chair......$250  Big Screen TV........$2500  Watching the Sens play the Pens in what is most likely going to be one of the best 1st round playoff series, while knowing the Leafs are booking Tee times.............PRICELESS !!!!  Go Sens Go!!!  Golf Leafs Golf!!!   FOTB "
57360,beerman,2007-04-09 13:46:00,118,"I love hockey and I watch most games, no matter who plays. The Pens are young, and that may turn out to be a good thing. They don,t have much experience in the play offs at all, which may be a good thing to. I am happy with the year they had, no matter if they win another game or not.. I am also happy they are staying in the city.. Its been a great year here in pittsburgh, no mattter who wins this series..  PS..I also LOVE canada, which I will be comming up fishing may 30th, cochrane , ontario... I go every year, great country, great people, and AWESOME beer!!"
57362,Headhunter,2007-04-09 13:55:00,5703,"The Leaf's are in trouble for the next 3 years as they don't have a goal tender who can make the big save, when the team needs it most. Funny enough, I think Ottawa is in the same boat. Goaltending and defense with cups, so I have to say that Buffalo has the advantage. Perhaps the youth of Pittsburg can work to their advantage in a long series and you just can't count out Gary Roberts influence during the playoffs. I really hope that this long playoff drought hits home with MLSE and that the higher up heads roll down Bay street and into the harbour. Carp have to eat to, you know! HH"
57364,muskymatt,2007-04-09 13:57:00,2608, That is absolutely beautiful...  Matt
57373,specktacklure,2007-04-09 14:15:00,56,Ottawa doesn't have a goaltender that can make a big save ???? Are you kidding ? Emery Will take us to the cup no problem.Emery has more than proven his worth as a starting goalie in the NHL.You obviously haven't watched him play !!!!
57408,Headhunter,2007-04-09 16:13:00,5703,"Well, last time I checked, he hadn't won anything! He's not proven and has no real track record of success that would lead me to believe that he has what it takes to be an elite goalie. Elite goalies win cups for their teams. HH"
57417,Moosebunk,2007-04-09 16:32:00,3970,"As a Sens fan... Emery's playoff worth has yet to be seen.  It's a coin toss.  Nice to have a team in though,  And, no matter how my chosen team does at least it did better than one other for 2 years in a row now.  Playoffs help the lousy, no-fishing month of April pass."
57431,beerman,2007-04-09 17:10:00,118,"I agree Moose. Nothing compares to play off hockey, except that 25 lb pike on the end of your line... Hockey playoffs are the best..."

57529,steve_paul,2007-04-09 21:27:00,658," Didn't the same things get said about Lalime for a few years too - how did that work out??  As a hockey fan, I am looking forward to seeing the Pens / Sens series - should be some good fast hockey and hopefully a long series.  Watch out for the Sharks out west though.  Sharks over Sabres in the cup final."
57594,fishboy,2007-04-09 23:38:00,550,..at least we Leafers don't have to listen to the Hab fans....hopefully MLSE finally sees the light and blows the thing up and starts over
57602,charlied,2007-04-09 23:54:00,584,ya but we are hearing the Sens fans and they are just as bad if not worse!
57844,blaque,2007-04-10 12:27:00,2419,"I can tell you the beat on the street down here in Sabres country, We all had our fingers crossed that we wouldnt play Toronto in the first round."
57082,Moosebunk,2007-04-08 22:22:00,3970,"Could here a pin drop from far and wide at 6:13pm across the Leaf's Nation.  It'll be nice having full coverage for all the Sens games on CBC.  Go Sens Go.           little poke, that's all"
57087,muskymatt,2007-04-08 22:26:00,2608,Got that right moosebunk  Golf leafs golf  Matt

57102,charlied,2007-04-08 22:56:00,584,sens out..pens in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
57107,pidge,2007-04-08 23:06:00,438,"yup I prey the Pen's give it to the Sen's. Disapointed leafs didnt make it, but you knew that was coming.  Oh well"
57113,Jigger,2007-04-08 23:10:00,1237,"A great way to end a season... I bet Gary Bettmans phone is on fire right now... Why not just flip a coin and not have a season. NHL lost a good percentage of viewers with no Montreal and no Toronto, and NO GUYS, no matter how hard you want it to be Ottawa will NEVER be Canadas team.  GO CANUCKS!!!"
57123,bucktail,2007-04-08 23:22:00,1857,Im glad they are out. Moosebunk is right on having full coverage. Wether you like the Sens or Pens you have to admit that this series is going to be FUN to watch!! Skills!! As opposed to leafs getting bludgeoned by the Sabres!
57133,Jigger,2007-04-08 23:26:00,1237,"I think the Sabres would have been the best match-up for the Leafs... Oh well, I think the Pens vs Sens could end up being the best series in the East. Good Luck to all of you. At least I can watch hockey stress-free now"
57139,DanTheMan,2007-04-08 23:28:00,257,"Dont let the Islanders fool you, they will give the Sabres a better run then you think.Mark my words, the sabres dont win that easy, expescially if Dipietrio comes back.  I say the the Islanders in 7"
57150,jediangler,2007-04-08 23:36:00,1923,"The Islanders have to go with Doobie now, he got them there.  Doobie, Doobie, Doobie..."
57167,lunkerbasshunter,2007-04-08 23:49:00,2585,buffalo will take the isles in 5  pens in 7  i say buffallo and the ducks in the final.  As for the leafs....die hard leaf fan here.  but seriously if they would have made it to the playoffs they would have lost first round anyway. Until they get a solid 40+++ goal scorer to play with sundin and raycroft plays much better i think next year may be much of the same. Maybe a healthy wellwood and peca would have got them into the playoffs but i think raycrofts lack of confidence and average play would not have carried them to far.  Cheers!
57183,trapshooter,2007-04-09 00:06:00,1234,  You got it Raf.  Cup's coming to Buffalo
57196,charlied,2007-04-09 00:21:00,584,I think the cup is going to the West conference!

57206,charlied,2007-04-09 00:27:00,584,its funny how everybody jumps all over the leafs....you guys are true expressions of bad hockey fans thats for sure!
57214,jediangler,2007-04-09 00:32:00,1923,"Ha. Better a bad hockey fan, than a fan of bad hockey. Priceless photo muskymatt.  Penguins vs Wild  Wild wins the cup"
57221,Marty,2007-04-09 00:41:00,873,Let's Go Pens!  Their youth scares me but it sure beats last year.     Watch for me at the games wearing my OFC hat and my signed Crosby jersey!
57260,charlied,2007-04-09 02:18:00,584, Fan of bad hockey team over a bad hockey fan...NOT.....this is the reason for fights in the stands and stuff...bad hockey fans  make going to games not enjoyable.  People only point out the bad games the leafs play and not when they play really good hockey.
57324,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-04-09 11:08:00,0," Bad hockey fans, --------------- NOT.  Leafs are a bunch of goons and have been for years, never any actual hockey. Yes they beat the Sens in the playoffs but if was all about the goons and certainly not about the game of hockey. People hate them because of their dirty play and because TO is the center of the universe. LOL My god Sundin is their best player !!!!!! Who's next Tucker? Wonder why they are not in the playoffs.  BTW I'm not looking forward to national coverage on CBC. Those announcers are the worse, the old guys are so senile they'll be calling leafs players names all series long. They always were bias toward the leafs. The good thing is over here we'll be able to get it in French with the Habs out.  I would like to see Sens vs. Cannucks in the final but I am afraid it will be a team from CA.  Charlied you need to come to Ottawa for a Leafs game if you want to see what a bad fan is, the stands are full of them in blue and white jerseys.  Golf Leafs Golf"
57329,beerman,2007-04-09 11:58:00,118,"Hey everyone, I live in Pittsburgh, Pa. The city is going crazy for the PENS.. I called for play-off tickets 3 weeks ago, first 2 rounds sold out.. The fans will have what they call a black out, everyone will be wearing black!!  I did get tickets for my son and I, but I had to pay...... Anyways, Its gonna be a great series.... I say Pens in 7!!! Peace"
57339,thecraftyprince,2007-04-09 12:37:00,37,Big comfy armchair ...... $250  Big Screen Tv .............. $2500  Watching the sens choke on national TV .......... PRICELESS !!!
