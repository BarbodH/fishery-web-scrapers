57024,brandon,2007-04-08 19:42:00,857,keep this discussion goin guys.....dont worry about goin off topic.  I wanna know more thoughts about what people think about the transport going back to skeeters posts about transport during tourneys.  Anybody else have any insight on that?
57032,irishfield,2007-04-08 20:18:00,26272,Per the regs Brandon...illegal as soon as they pull that boat out of the water on the trailer and head for the weigh in. But that's not the only reg broken during Bass tourneys..but do we really want to go down that road again here?
57033,brandon,2007-04-08 20:20:00,857,apparently not.....thanks for clearing up my questions fellas

57044,ryanheritage,2007-04-08 20:57:00,180,"If you get a fish from a lake you cannot keep it. If you get a fish from a stocking facility you can keep it. The problem being if you are transporting live fish is that you could potentially be transporting disease or non native species (eggs, baitfish,) to different areas thus the dead fish thing. But if you were to get a stocking fish from a farm you can keep it and no it wouldn't be considered out of season if you caught it in your tank. ( private land). Lets think about this... You ever bought a live trout north of the cn rail tracks out of season? the ones swimming around in the grocery store tank? Or have you seen the demonstrations at Bass pro? I know this cause I have actullay asked this question. lol Yep too much paint chips as a kid.. I buy bait from a place called Leonards in Verona ontario, and he is the guy that supplies walleye, and catfish to Bass pro for that hhuge tank. He also supplies walleye fingerlings and other species for stocking programs throughout ontario. He has only had one problem.... Sending fish to tanks across the border(south). other then that don't fish out of season."
57162,Clampet,2007-04-08 23:45:00,1947,"  So Brandon is accosted by the Game Warden while jest steppin' off the local community dock, with none other than 2 live fish in a cooler.  ""'Scuse me"" ventured the game Warden.  ""I'm afraid I will have to charge you with the illegal transporting of fish that are out of season"".  ""You are mistaken, officer"" Brandon responded confidently. ""These here fish are my pets"".  ""Pets""? ""Yes"" ""How so""?  ""Well, I caught them last summer, while they were in season, and brought them home fer the kids.  They just love 'em.  Even named 'em Bob an Rob.  Ain't that cute""?  ""Well, nice try"" the game warden said.  "" I do not beleive you""!  ""Honest"" countered Brandon.  "" I bring them down here to the dock fer a little swim in the open water.  They have been trained by me an the kids with special signals, I usually have a smoke, while they swim around under the dock, an when I finish I give 'em the special signal, they return, and we go back home.  I can prove it"".  ""Well this I gotta see""  insisted the CO.  Wall, Brandon and the CO make their way to the end of the Pier, and brandon puts first one, then the other Fish gently into the water, and they both watch the two fish slowly swim a bit in a circle then go slowly down under the dock. Brandom lights up a smoke, and makes small talk with the Game Warden.  A cuople minutes go by and the CO says:  "" Ok, put that cigarette out and call back the fish"" ""What fish""?"

57223,Fishmaster,2007-04-09 00:47:00,920,Good one clampet ....  ..these are all good topics to bring up for people that don't no Regs ...there is nothing wrong with others opions but never go buy them ...
57013,easton13th,2007-04-08 18:52:00,371,"I guess the warrant issue is as clear as mud. I read the Laws as stated in e-laws.  1.A conservation officer may obtain a search warrant under Part VIII of the Provincial Offences Act .  2.If a conservation officer believes on reasonable grounds that there is in a building or other place any thing that will afford evidence of an offence under this Act but that the time required to obtain a search warrant would lead to the loss, removal or destruction of the evidence, the conservation officer may, without a search warrant, enter and search the building or other place.  3.A conservation officer who is lawfully in a building or other place may, without a warrant, seize any thing that he or she believes on reasonable grounds,  (a) has been obtained by the commission of an offence under this Act;  ( has been used in the commission of an offence under this Act;  © will afford evidence of the commission of an offence under this Act; or  (d) is intermixed with a thing referred to in clause (a), ( or ©.  4. ( that entry to the dwelling has been refused or there are reasonable grounds to believe that entry will be refused.  I guess YES they need a warrant BUT if they believe they need one they would have had it already... and if they don't have it already their arses are covered......so I guess in the long and short of it they don't really need one."
57018,Fisherman,2007-04-08 19:17:00,7201,"How about going back to the original question, nothing to do with out of season, TRANSPORT OF LIVE FISH, legal or not?"
57021,setomonkey,2007-04-08 19:34:00,872,"Sounds like a lot of unnecessary confusion & debate to me.  Avoid the hassle and leave the bass in the lake, or kill it and eat it.  Mike"
57022,Sinker,2007-04-08 19:35:00,8692," Not legal.  The question was pertaining to possession tho.......  ......its right in the title!  Easton,  2.If a conservation officer believes on reasonable grounds that there is in a building or other place any thing that will afford evidence of an offence under this Act but that the time required to obtain a search warrant would lead to the loss, removal or destruction of the evidence, the conservation officer may, without a search warrant, enter and search the building or other place.  In other words, exigent circumstances. Key words are in bold to the definition of exigent. Also, check  under search of a Dwelling......that may be different again, but I'm not positive in the FWCA. Need to see the definition of a dwelling first I guess. I don't have the time to check it out right now, but it will be in there.  They can't just come to your door and expect you to let them in for a search without a warrant for no reason. If someone has called and told them that you have 100 walleye in your freezer, then sure, they're coming in, no questions asked. That would be reasonable, and probable grounds.  I still say they don't give a rats ass whether you have a bass or any other kind of fish in your aquarium........you think they have time for something like that? I doubt it........  Sorry for getting off topic Brandon  Sinker"
