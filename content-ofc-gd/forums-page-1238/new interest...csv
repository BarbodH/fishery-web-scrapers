57234,Pigeontroller,2007-04-09 01:05:00,2793," Thats a vague question...These are two very different fish, that happen to both migrate at a similar time. Do you plan to fish small tribs for Spring Steelhead? Or cast the piers for Fall Chinook? Or maybe target them from a boat in August?"
57236,Heybud_e,2007-04-09 01:07:00,208,"ya i was thinking more off the pier fishing, but sometimes boating... PM if u dont mind Pigeontroller"
57251,Pigeontroller,2007-04-09 01:57:00,2793,"For casting from piers I would think a 8-10 foot med-hvy casting rod, with an Abu C3. Would also make a decent trolling rod."
57253,Heybud_e,2007-04-09 02:04:00,208,was actually just looking at a 8ft med-heavy rod at the BPS website....  http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...0002000_100-2-5  lookin at reels now... thanks pigeontroller
