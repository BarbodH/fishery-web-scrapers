57541,Roy,2007-04-09 21:58:00,13728,"OK, I have a soaked cedar plank on the BBQ with  some salmon backs on there and a dozen very large shrimps. I also have a half cup up Jack Daniels flakes in an aluminum pack with a hole through the top for some smoke flavour. What would you guys baste the stuff with? So far I've gotten answers like  'marmalade and maple syrup'...any thoughts please? It's a 40 minute deal...30 minutes left!"
57545,Jen,2007-04-09 22:06:00,833,"I would not baste them with anything, sounds perfect just the way you have it...  Jen"
57546,GbayGiant,2007-04-09 22:08:00,1780,Any Diana's sauce.
57547,canadian_copper,2007-04-09 22:08:00,925,IM WITH JEN ON THAT 1!!!
57548,Roy,2007-04-09 22:08:00,13728,Thanks Jen and GBG  also thanks to you CC.
57551,T Fisher,2007-04-09 22:09:00,139,"Try this....  SOYA SAUCE 3ts HONEY 5ts MUSTARD 2ts mix all and bast as needed  Yes simple, but good.  THE JACK, DRINK ACCORDINGLY."
57552,irishfield,2007-04-09 22:10:00,26272,Roy...just tip an Old Milwakee and make sure they don't catch on fire!
57558,fishboy,2007-04-09 22:20:00,550,"I'm probably too late but you can't go wrong with the maple syrup suggestion (water it down a bit) but it's not necessary with what you have.  Another idea is to lay thin slices of orange/lemon and red onion on the fish.  For the shrimp, try brushing them with oil and some dry cajun spice."
57563,Gerritt,2007-04-09 22:23:00,6129,I would go with real maple syrup...  not the cheap table syrup (aunt jamima stuff)  I do my Salmon w/ a Maple glaze often...  other then that I prefer Lemon Pepper bake and serve.  Gerritt.
57571,Big Cliff,2007-04-09 22:30:00,6899,"Best meal I ever served:  A dash of wine, a candles Glow. Blend with music, soft and slow. Serve with tender loving care! May this be one dish you will often share!  written by 'Big Cliff"""

57582,Jen,2007-04-09 22:55:00,833,"Ok, I like Cliff's recipe!  Being an upstanding member of the 2% here!  cheers  Jen"
57598,Roy,2007-04-09 23:48:00,13728,"Yes Cliff you silver tongued devil you....now I know why Sue worships the ground you walk on.  Well, I was gunna let it ride but it seemed a little dry so I basted with a little Portugese oil and the slightest bit of hoisin sauce. Worked out great. Thanks for the suggestions folks."

57751,POLLIWOGG,2007-04-10 02:19:00,835,"A little late but the first thing to come to mind was, Jack Daniels.  Also cures sea sickness."
57817,aplumma,2007-04-10 11:01:00,6896,Sorry I am to late for last nights salmon but here is a good one for tonights.  I was thinking more like  1/2 cup of orange juice 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar 1 teaspoon of white pepper 4 tablespoons of honey  warm in the microwave for 30 seconds and then whisk.  Adjust pepper for taste.   Art
