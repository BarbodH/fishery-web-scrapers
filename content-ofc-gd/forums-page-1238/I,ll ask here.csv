57375,misfish,2007-04-09 14:26:00,29133,"Im sure to get an answer,good or bad.  Why cant I reply to the Mercer thread? Is it because people that speak thier mind get banned from it?   Thank you   It seems the few, have more power, then the many."
57378,Terry,2007-04-09 14:34:00,14456,yeah I tried to reply yesterday and it was a locked thread..I see Roy could open it to comment  it doesn't make a level playing field
57380,misfish,2007-04-09 14:41:00,29133,"No lock symbol to be seen,Im guessing a certian few cannot reply.To that section of the board."
57384,Guest gbfisher,2007-04-09 15:12:00,0,I'm sure Dave would entertain yer PM's .......  I can't post on it either if that helps any...
57386,misfish,2007-04-09 15:16:00,29133,"Not towards Dave. Oh GB,sometimes.................................  LOL"
57388,Puckhead,2007-04-09 15:18:00,377,I suspect that section is for advertisers/contributors of the pay per use variety.
57389,Gerritt,2007-04-09 15:20:00,6129,I too was unable to comment... all I wanted to ask about was the twins  Gerritt.
57429,irishfield,2007-04-09 17:00:00,26272,"It looks like it may have been getting out of hand Brian (the announce section..not the Mercer post itself).....people like me posting stuff like the availablity of a limited edition boat etc and various other posts that I'm pretty sure weren't the intended purpose of the announce section. I wondered when the announce section was first put up, and it had the ""may have the smell of spam"" warning on it, how long it would last as an open post forum.  It now has the following disclaimer on it, ""You'll find announcements for fishing events, TV shows, meetings and sales in here. Caution: May Contain Advertising. New announcements require administrator approval"", so it's like being on Mod que. Post your announcement and someone will screen it before it goes out to the world. I can understand this whole heartedly and my suggestion to you..... if you'd like to comment on the mercer thread.... would be to highlight/copy and paste it to start a new thread in the General Discussion area.  Wayne"
57432,misfish,2007-04-09 17:13:00,29133,"  Ok,who,s paying you off.............................LOL"

57437,Roy,2007-04-09 17:22:00,13728,There are some really worthwhile announcements in there. Perhaps I shouldn't have answered the Toyota Texas Bass tourney thread...I just wanted to congratulate Dave Mercer and Fish Fishborne for their achievements.
57449,TJQ,2007-04-09 17:53:00,7806,LOL.. if we could keep the mods off it .....
57463,misfish,2007-04-09 18:17:00,29133,"Like I said,good or bad. Thanks,just a bit of a vent.  Alls well Roy,na worries."
57484,Dave Mercer,2007-04-09 19:22:00,148,"Hi All, well I am not sure what the issue is but feel free to PM me or email me threw my site. Once again thank you all for your support and take care.  Dave Mercer"
57502,misfish,2007-04-09 20:25:00,29133,"Oh now Im in big trouble. LOL   Dave, nothing with you. Congrats on the MC with Fish.  Talk soon.   Brian"
