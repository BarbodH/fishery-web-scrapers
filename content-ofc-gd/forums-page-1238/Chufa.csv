I have seen how good Chufa is at keeping turkeys around in a certain area but this was in some of the south eastern states... How well does it fare up here and how often must it be planted... Its going to be for turkeys of course but I wanted to know if it survives Ok in southern Ontario, which I figure it should and as well where I can get enough to plant on about an acre... Thanks for any help guys...   Bill"
