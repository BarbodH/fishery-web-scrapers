Wondering who that might be I answered the phone.  me: hello.  lady: hmm....hello (probably not recognizing my voice and a bit unsure if she dialed the correct #)  me: hello...  lady: hmm......  me: Hi, you probably dialed the wrong number?  lady: Have I reached Canada?  me: yeah, but you might have dialed the wrong number.  lady: but I reached Canada?  me: yeah....*#)*(#&)*)$)   Like there are only two phone #'s in Canada. Gosh.... Either I am not in a good mood working in my office 6pm on Sunday, or I am just a mean guy."
57114,Clampet,2007-04-08 23:11:00,1947,"That's why you have call display. When I get a call that I do not recognize (etc), I do not answer. If the caller doesn't leave a message, I do not concerm myself about who it is. A great invention."
57124,MJL,2007-04-08 23:22:00,2427,"Wolf, you missed a perfect opportunity to mess with her mind.  You can have the time of your life playing with wrong number callers or telemarketers.  I know I do...I'm a b@st@rd when it comes to telemarketers...If they have the nerve to call me while I'm cooking/eating or during my favourite TV show, they should at least be  prepared for the wrath coming to them    To this day, Master Card and the Toronto Sun still don't call my house   .  You should have asked her ""what are you wearing?"" or asked for her phone number so you could ""hook up"" later.  You often get some interesting responses."

57279,Beans,2007-04-09 02:47:00,3339,"In the interval (dead air) between my ""hello"" and their answer I hit the # key several times then hang up)...Andy Rooney of ""60 Minutes"" fame sez this confuses their computer automated calling machine and it deletes your number from their files...I guess it works as we don't get very many call any more...If I wasn't quick enough, I ask them to hang on for a minute as I have to tend to the baby...A few minutes later they usually hang up...LOL  He also suggests mailing any junk mail without your name and addy on it back in those prepaid envelopes...they still have to pay to receive them...  I kinda reuse junk mail as fire starter for the wood stove instead..."
