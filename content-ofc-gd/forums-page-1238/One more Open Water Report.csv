57372,zman,2007-04-09 14:11:00,179,Nice report I love fishing there
57391,Joey,2007-04-09 15:27:00,9122," Lew, boinging is a natural phenomenon that happens when you lean your rod against something to continue fishing while you take your gloves off to try to light a smoke in -10 wind chill and notice, out of the corner of your eye, an up and down movement of your rod tip in a way that was not happening when you were just sitting there doing nothing holding your rod and watching it intently  Hope this clears things up.  Joey"
57403,Douger,2007-04-09 15:50:00,116,Great weekend!  Congrats!  -d-

57514,easton13th,2007-04-09 20:59:00,371,"I get it ignore the rod,, ignore the fish and they hit! A watched rod never gets a hit... I will have to try it as other than the seagull I am on a skunk streak. But the season is young I hope......"

57678,Ron,2007-04-10 01:02:00,1683,"Nice read Joey, but why why why did you have to take a picture of my Summer retreat???"
57075,Joey,2007-04-08 22:07:00,9122,"What's Easter without a long weekend steelie fishing trip     Headed down to our favorite haunt Friday morning and checked in.  Our buddy Marlinda was running the joint for the winter again while her parents soak up the sun in Florida.  She's such a hoot and a really nice lady.  She came and joined us for a beer and a smoke and we caught up on old times.  She was mentioning she knows Shaun Rickard of OFC and Urban Outdoor Adventures.  She says Hi Shaun.    The weather was COLD all weekend and it snowed most of the time.  But we made out pretty good.  I started out with this 29 inch beauty (An entry for Team 2).    And then Paul pulled up the rear with this nice little male (he looks almost disappointed at the size   )     Nothing else for us Friday, but we were happy.  Saturday morning was not only cold, it was flipping cold  I got one on second drift, had a bit of a fight, and it was off again  We went back to the start of the drift again and right in the same spot I had the first one for the day on, I got another.  This time I set the hook    and was rewarded with this beauty    I know it was bigger than my first, but after netting her, she wrapped herself up in the line and by the time I got her unwrapped I didn't want to waste any more time with her out of the water so I didn't take a pic with the measuring tape or OFC sign.  I wanted to get her back into the water.  I gave her a moment to revive and down she swam.  Surprised my hands weren't black with frostbite after that tho.  Gosh they hurt, and for quite awhile too.  Nothing more caught Saturday, but I did manage to get some good pictures of ice and of a Turkey Vulture that swooped down to steal a sea gulls meal.            This morning we woke up to this outside the door of our room.    But we went down and launched anyhow and got chatting with Barry Pringle who was just out taking a look with his coffee and talking to fishermen.  We got a tip from a nice couple the night before about another drift so we decided to give that a try.  It paid off and second drift Paul gets this nice 29 incher.  I really gotta teach that boy to be more photogenic    Not much happend for awhile after that and I took a pic of a neat fort someone had constructed out of trees.    Then my rod started boinging and it was fish on.  Paul grabbed the net but this fish wasn't fighting quite like the others and I was a little disappointed when it surfaced.  But a fish is a fish, and I'm forever grateful for every one I catch.  A Sucker!!!!!    We called it a day after that and headed home.  We both had a great time and relaxed one more time before the big move at the end of the month.  Cheers and hope you enjoyed the report.  Joey"
