56963,fliptheslop,2007-04-08 17:00:00,112,I was wondering are steelhead eggs as good to use as salmon eggs for roe? Also does anyone have a simple but good way to cure them
57017,charlied,2007-04-08 19:02:00,584,I find them better....and what I do is just water harden them in the water you got the fish from.....the water is usually cold enough to harden them...keep in a bag for rinse them off and drain water...then put more stream water in there and leave for like 10-15 minutes...thats all I do!
