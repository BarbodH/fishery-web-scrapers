Bass and Walleye fishing was pretty good couple of weeks ago, don't let the heavy covers scare you, slowly present your texas whatever will catch you largies.  The walleye seemed to be quite active as the sun is going down in the evening...the chartreuse/white spinnerbait produced for us for both species this time of the day.   And there's alway the scrappy crappy to keep you busy.  Good fishing, let us know how you do."
95322,acemojo,2007-07-18 05:24:00,2,"Thanks for the info Redfin, I will be staying at Serpent mounds park. I will be looking for both bass and walleye and maybe as you said some crappie. Can't wait, thanks again"
95348,Rich,2007-07-18 11:04:00,3927,Don't be afraid to toss a 2 inch grub around for the 'eyes and crappies. You'd be surprised at how big some of the fish will be that will smack a little grub in Rice.
95428,redfin,2007-07-18 16:07:00,79,"I'll second that.  We found some small crappie behind Sugar island by the Indian River, and the kids were catching them with the beetle spinners.  You really don't have to go far as good walleye and bass fishing to be had near Serpend Mounds, or go across to the other side to White Island / Dunnette Landing area for some good bass action. P.S.  Bring topwater lures too for the evening bite.  Good fishing."
95453,Whopper,2007-07-18 17:07:00,2174,"Ace if you stand on the beach area at SP and look way out to your left is a island called Sugar. There is a massive weed bed off the west or right side of it, go out on the channel side and find an edge or hole and fish, water in that area is about six to eight foot deep. You can catch everything out there from panfish, bass and walleye. Just keep moving arond the edges and holes till you find them.  Good Luck  Whopper"
