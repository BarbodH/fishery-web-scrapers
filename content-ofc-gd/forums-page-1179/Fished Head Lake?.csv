95246,jjjiggin,2007-07-18 01:21:00,6,"Considering trying ""Head Lake"" (between Dalrymple and Balsam) next weekend. Has anyone fished it recently? Any luck? Advice? Most importantly - how and where is the launch?? I fish with my 10 year old so the launch needs to be half decent!  Thanks, JJJiggin  This is my 10 yr old with a couple of bass from Balsam!!  "
95251,bucktail,2007-07-18 01:32:00,1857,There are 2 launchs. One is off of Suter road and the other across from the store. be VERY careful in this lake. It has numerous schoals that come out of no where and is notoriopus for eating props. Especailly in the north end.
