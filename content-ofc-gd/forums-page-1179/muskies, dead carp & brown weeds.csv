94550,Mike Pike,2007-07-16 16:18:00,1332,"Well, you may not have made it out much so far this year Lew, but it doesn't look like you've missed a beat.  Good fish and thanks for the report and pics."
94558,ozaibak1,2007-07-16 16:36:00,401,"Too bad Pigeon lake has some bad weed, I had a rough trip there 2 weeks ago if you want some of the good stuff go to Stoney lake its nice and green and makes all the fish happy and mellow."
94586,lew,2007-07-16 17:26:00,12767," Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of healthy green weed on Pigeon, but there is  lots of bad stuff in some of my favorite spots that is not normally like that this time of year. This is something that has only happened this year.  As for Stoney, I was there last weekend, and yes there is lots of excellent green growth, but I also found alot of terrible stuff too, that wouldn't even attract all those dead carp that are floating everywhere.  I've been fishing the Kawarthas for a very long time, maybe 50 years, and I've just never before seen this much brown, slimey weed growth, and so close to the surface, before.  I just hope there isn't an underlying problem in those waters that may even be associated with the dead carp.......but I'm just thinking out loud about that ."
94628,wkrp,2007-07-16 18:29:00,656,Can the unusual weed growth be caused by the july weather in june or is it global warming ? However nice catch Lew as always.
94692,lookinforwalleye,2007-07-16 20:58:00,4399," Interesting comments on the Carp and weeds, when the Carp were dying off on Scugog I noticed the same thing no small fish they were all larger. And the weed is interesting as well this year on Scugog we have a real weed problem many of my good bass spot are so choked with milfoil they are inaccesible. The Nonquon river for example is usually difined by a healthy growth of reeds that creates a defined channel that leads to the river this year no reeds at all. I was talking to resident on Scugog and he figures the reason for the increased amount of weeds this year is because of the late freeze up and the lack of snow on the ice I don`t know if I buy that."
94773,Kerry,2007-07-16 23:52:00,383,I think that the months of Dec/Jan are playing heavily on what we're seeing now.I've never seen so many small fish around the boardwalk area here in Orillia as this spring.It was warm enough for spawning in early January.And weeds are already starting to die back around here in places.Imagine what it must be like in areas of the Kawartha's when the water level is adjusted as much as 4ft during the winter months.The combination has to put a strain on something.  Kerry
94794,Squid,2007-07-17 00:57:00,1656,Nice looking fish there Lew!!!
94799,snagmaster,2007-07-17 01:11:00,250,nice fish man ...im going to give pigeon a try this week
94841,Moosebunk,2007-07-17 02:54:00,3970,Weeds are a little slower up here this year Lew.  Ya still managed a few ski's for yer troubles.  Good show.
94864,hydro,2007-07-17 03:56:00,24,Should have just left the Kawarthas for us fisherman.  EVerything will spread through the system because of the boat traffic and canals.  Just like Pike will be into everything in here soon enough - invasive foreign species will wreak havoc even faster.  They can't even figure it out.
94232,lew,2007-07-15 23:04:00,12767,"I haven't been fishing much this year, but have been going out the odd time, so my daughter & I decided to head to Pigeon on Saturday for the 1st time this year to see if there were any muskies hanging around my favorite spots.  We launched the boat about 8:00 and headed to the 1st spot and were only casting about 10 minutes when I got this little guy.    We fished that spot for awhile then headed further north to another place I like and again got a fish within about 10 minutes.  We get quite a few muskies every year with lymphosarcoma and if you look on the sides of this fish you can see 2 scars that appear to have been lympho, but have healed over quite nicely. That's always a good sign.    We fished till around 2:00 and by then the wind was starting to get pretty strong and the waves on the big lake were making casting pretty difficult, so we trolled for awhile but never saw another fish so we called it a day and headed in.  I've been reading all the reports lately on the carp die-off in the Kawarthas but must admit I was really surprised at how many dead carp I saw on Pigeon Lake. I'd guess that in 6 hours I saw at  least 100 of them. Odd thing too was  the fact that it seemed like it was only very large fish that were dead and I don't think I saw any under about 10 pounds.  I spend an awful lot of time fishing the Kawarthas every year but don't recall ever seeing as much poor quality weed as this year, plus the amount of it compared to other years.  Some of the my normal spots that I fish all the time are nearly choked off with weeds right up to the surface, where normally at this time of year their 4 & 5 feet below the surface. Alot of the weeds are also brown and appear nearly dead, where normally their a very vivid green color until into the later months.  I wonder if there's any corrilation between all the poor quality weeds this year and the dead carp floating everywhere ??"
94233,Joey,2007-07-15 23:08:00,9122,"Hmm, you make an interesting point about the weeds and carp die off Lew.  It will be interesting to see what they come up with for a reason this is happening.  Nice muskies you and Sherri caught.  Great report.  Joey"
94235,Beans,2007-07-15 23:14:00,3339,Hey Lew...seems you were posting while I was sending you a PM...LOL
94238,Rizzo,2007-07-15 23:27:00,4754,"don't recall ever seeing as much poor quality weed as this year  ...funny how things taken out of context can be given a totally different meaning  nice fish though, good to see that they can heal nicely too after some pretty ugly ulcerations"
94240,addict,2007-07-15 23:29:00,475,"nice job on those lunge,its been awhile since i got a pigeon monster.cant seem to pull my fishin partner away from those bass lips and try for something with teeth.we too have noticed the crap brown weeds and lack of bright green ones there should be this time of year.thanks for the post i love those apex predators."
94247,Joey,2007-07-15 23:35:00,9122, Maybe the Carp are OD'ing on Bad Weed Rizz
94250,Rizzo,2007-07-15 23:37:00,4754,LOL I knew I could count on you Joey
94260,Handlebarz,2007-07-15 23:52:00,3790,Glad you had time to get out Lew I know we missed our date but i will be making up before the summer is out or maybe Sept I wonder when others will be holding the fish in your boat you shure know how to work the cast.
94295,Rich,2007-07-16 00:30:00,3927,I dunno the kawartha weed was always good to me!  Nice 'skies Lew!! God I wish I lived up there again..
94298,Nanook,2007-07-16 00:33:00,565, Nice job on the 'ski's Lew. as usual.  Todays local new's rag states that the MNR still dont know whats killing the Carp.
94315,Greencoachdog,2007-07-16 00:52:00,8163,"Great report and pics Lew!!!  That big Muskie smile never changes, does it?"
94318,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-07-16 00:56:00,0,Good to see you are catching a few Lew!
94342,Crazyhook,2007-07-16 01:55:00,1154,"great fish Lew, Man this carp this is not good"
94344,mattyk,2007-07-16 02:11:00,2110,nice report Lew. Thanks for sharing.
94369,Marty,2007-07-16 02:47:00,873,Nice report Lew.  Good to see some muskies to get me ready for my trip.
94376,Mike the Pike,2007-07-16 03:03:00,3421,Good to see you getting out Lew and nice to see a Muskie report.Sherri good on you for getting out with Lew.  Looking forward to the next report.MTP
94377,pikeie,2007-07-16 03:03:00,380,"you are sure right about this carp thing lew. tinbanger and i were out on pigeon on wednesday for a while harrassing the local bass population (man were there ever lots of small fish) only got 4, 2-2.5 lbsers out of the 20+ bass we caught. but there were dead carp in almost every spot we fished in some places the smell was unbarable ugh!! i will try to get a report up tomarrow night."
94403,b2kptbo,2007-07-16 09:55:00,1505,Nice report Lew and I've seen the brown weeds also...
94417,Roy,2007-07-16 10:47:00,13728,"Glad you're still bring them in Lew. I may be opening up a can of worms here but I think that long term, carp will spell the end of the Kawarthas as a fishing destination."
94418,misfish,2007-07-16 10:51:00,29133,WTG Lew.Awesome bud.  I was told that Chemong had dead carp and a few muskys floating around. My bro was there saturday fishing with his son.
94423,solopaddler,2007-07-16 11:15:00,8605," Hate to say it, but that could happen...  Anyhow, beyond the dead carp thing, nice report Lew."
94443,lew,2007-07-16 12:02:00,12767," You could be right Roy, but the way those critters are dropping, there may not be any left in the Kawarthas by the end of this year. From some of the reports around, the die-off is spreading thru the system pretty darned quick.  The stench in a few areas was enuff to chase me away, one small bay had about 6 rotting carcasses floating around in it"
94445,crappiesteve,2007-07-16 12:12:00,220,"Lew,you are smilling,they just can,t see under the stache  ,Nice couple of skiesWTG.  Steve"
94485,Beans,2007-07-16 13:44:00,3339,  People were saying that about Lake Scugog 60 years ago...sure took a long time to happen...I think it is just Ma Nature's way of thinning the herd...   A scientist in fish biology at Trent University thinks it is a carp specific virus...Peterborough Examiner 15 July 2007
94489,fishnsled,2007-07-16 13:56:00,3520,Great report Lew!  It certainly will be interesting to see if they do find any corrilation between the die off of carp and the poor quality of weeds in the lakes this year.
