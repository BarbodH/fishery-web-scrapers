94874,danw,2007-07-17 04:50:00,72,Just wondering do you bus there or drive there? And if you drive is there a place that you can drop off the car?
94893,MJL,2007-07-17 06:34:00,2427, I don't think I've ever seen free parking downtown...There are numerous pay parking lots around the area though.  I've always taken the TTC to the Islands except on one occasion where we parked the car at the lot at the bottom of Yonge st (I think)...It might have been around $8-10 to park for the day (I think)
