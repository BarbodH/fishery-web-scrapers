94557,Shaun Rickard,2007-07-16 16:30:00,144,"This past weekend I had the pleasure of fishing with my Nephew Janik Corbeil, C.J. Tracy and Ryan Wheeler.  Despite the annoying winds and extremely cool July air temps we made it out on the lake twice. Water temps on the lake out of Pickering, and many other areas in Ontario, are absolutely frigid for this time of the year. We were getting surface temps of anywhere from 46F to 54F. When you consider that generally at this time of year the surface temps on the big pond are around the 70F plus mark it gives you an idea of how cold the lake is right now. Air temps on the lake on Saturday when we headed out at 5.30am were an unbeleivable 9F  :shock:  Despite the adverse conditions we were able to boat some nice fish for the kids, it's a lot of fun watching the young guys fight these scrappy fish, and the looks on their faces when the Salmon and Trout were landed are priceless. One rule I have on my boat when kids are aboard is that they all get to fight a few fish before the adults have a go, it's important to keep them interested, the excitement of catching what they consider to be 'monster fish' works like a charm  :wink:  Water temps:  Surface - 46F to to 54F Down 40ft to 50ft - 39F to 45F  Depths and trolling speeds:  50ft to 80ft - Lines set down 20ft, 30ft, 40ft and 50ft (30 and 40ft being the most productive). Trolling speeds - 2.4 mph to 2.9 mph  Hot baits and lures:  1. Herring Strips fished on Teaser Heads (Silver/Red and Purple/Black/Silver) 6ft behind Hot Spot Flashers (Green/Silver and Silver/Silver). A great tip when running in shallow depths is to run only 2 rods with long leads back from the ball (75ft to 100ft), I am a great beleiver that less is more in situations like this  8) 2. Flies fished behind Smart Fish Flashers. 3. Rapala Deep Taildancers (Silver/Purple and Blue/Red/Silver) fished on long leads behind Off Shore Planer boards. this techique can be deadly 4. 12lb Shark Cannonbals. 5. P-Line Flourocarbon Leaders (30lb test for the Herring strip rigs and crankbaits and 50lb test for the flies).  Due to the cool water temps all across the Canadian side of the lake we have noticed that the fish are somewhat scattered. With the temps where they are the fish can be just about anywhere they like. The secret to our success was simply covering water until we found actively feeding fish.  Below are pictures of some of the fish and fun we had on the weekend. I would like to say congrats to both CJ and Janik on 'single handedly fighting and landing their first Trout and salmon, they both did a great job and fished liked true Professionals.                            Cheers, Shaun"
94566,dustink,2007-07-16 16:50:00,526,I'd say they had a great time...some real beauty fish there.  Congrats!!  dk
94583,StrikePro,2007-07-16 17:24:00,29,"I've often wondered about deep taildancers on a planer board.  I'm definitely going to give it a try now!  I headed off of Whitby both days as well.  Saturday was very poor (couldn't find a thing!)  Sunday was a different story.  We were 4 for 5 with 2 over 20 (22 and 24) with an 8 and a 17.  We were in 60-80 feet for all of our fish.  We were actually quite close to you when we got our 24, and all the others were out off Ajax.  The NK Mag in monkey puke caught me my 2 fish down 60 feet, and my dad caught his 2 on a '00' dodger with an atomik 3-fly rig.  Good fishing!"
94587,lunkerbasshunter,2007-07-16 17:33:00,2585,some great looking fish there!  Cheers!
94688,addict,2007-07-16 20:49:00,475,nice report.wont be long till i feel a sizzlin run of a great lakes salmon.can only imagine how hard they fight out there compared to when they reach the river mouths.
94694,bbog,2007-07-16 21:01:00,665,Fantastic report and pictures Shawn. This is what it is all about.
94699,StrikePro,2007-07-16 21:07:00,29,Nothing better than setting the hook into a 20+ pound king!
94770,JFR,2007-07-16 23:47:00,498,"Shaun, the smile of the lad's face, says it all.  Great report, healthy looking salmon.  Thanks for sharing your outing.  John"
94772,fatherof3,2007-07-16 23:52:00,1769,always good to see the kids having fun fishing. good job
94879,ilario,2007-07-17 05:29:00,166,the temps on lake O are really cool for this time of year...  u did well considering... i got skunked off bluffers on Sunday.. but i went out for only a couple of hours
95100,Shaun Rickard,2007-07-17 18:35:00,144,"Thanks guys, the kids certainly did enjoy themselves.  StrikePro, I would definately give them a shot, the way i look at it, good enough for the Walleye, good enough for the Salmon    Seriously though, when fishing relatively shallow water I think f you can get your baits back from and out from the boat the better chance you have of hooking up with fish you may have spooked with the boat on the way through an area. Especially in clear water.  Cheers, Shaun"
95105,BITEME,2007-07-17 18:54:00,1969,Nice Fish  where did you get the high collar  nautilus from ive been looking all over for one
95126,StrikePro,2007-07-17 19:38:00,29,"Yeah, whenever I'm fishing in less than 50 feet I don't bother running my downrigger and just run a dipsy."
95135,misfish,2007-07-17 20:03:00,29133,That one great report with pics Shaun. And thats one sweet looking set up. TFS
