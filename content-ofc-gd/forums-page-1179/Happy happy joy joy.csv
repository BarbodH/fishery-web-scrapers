94910,Terry,2007-07-17 10:25:00,14456,I guess I should fill up if they drop in the Bradford area too
94972,Headhunter,2007-07-17 13:52:00,5703,.97 cents I noticed on the way in this morning... hmmm I wonder what they will attribute this to and how long will it last? HH
94992,Golfisher,2007-07-17 14:35:00,586,We should build a tanker and start hoarding!
95144,Fishnfiend,2007-07-17 20:36:00,357,"so, $0.97 is a good deal?   Let's get excited when it gets down below $0.80.  I filled up on the way in this morning, too.  Every cent equals a dollar for me, so I capitalize whenever I can."
95175,motv8tr,2007-07-17 22:54:00,2587,I've been paying 86.9 to 87.3 for the last couple of months now...oh ya...that's diesel...sorry  They say the price drop is a higher amount of stores and the higher Canadian dollar ?  Maureen
95178,Greencoachdog,2007-07-17 23:01:00,8163,"Let's see... .97x3.8=$368.6 per U.S gallon, and we're still at $2.89 down here in Redneckville... still kinda pricey if ya ax me"
95184,Gerritt,2007-07-17 23:10:00,6129,wow our gas must be made of gold to warrant $368.6 Per US Gallon.... I say we sell all we have to the US and live free forever! LOL   Gerritt.
