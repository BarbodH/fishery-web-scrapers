95093,lew,2007-07-17 18:01:00,12767,"Congrats, that's a beautiful fish, but don't get too caught up in the size of them.  Unless your fishing a tourney or else it's a real monster, size doesn't really matter that much and some folks tend to get too caught up in how long or heavy a fish really is.  Just enjoy it for what it is"
