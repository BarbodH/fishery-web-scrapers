93391,Nemo,2007-07-12 16:48:00,727,Hey Keram if you haven't yet hit the search function quite a few threads. Including this link.  http://www.baptistelake.org/1fish.asp
93394,keram,2007-07-12 16:55:00,585,"I already did, not much info on this particular area."
93415,ranger520vx,2007-07-12 18:11:00,164,"Probably the best bay on the lake...Good Largemouth and Muskie in there.  Fish the moment. If calm, try a topwater, a little windy-try a spinnerbait.  Shoreline blown in slop will hold largemouth too-try texas rigged plastics."
93505,Baptiste,2007-07-13 00:28:00,37,"Keram, I'm with Ranger for technique. I don't know how to fish, but I've been catching fish at Baptiste all my life. Do you have a boat and what are you targeting? Panfish are everywhere but walleye, laketrout and others are pretty site specific. You can drive to High Falls for a great shore adventure or boat up to Elephant Lk with great selection along the way. Good Luck and remember the camera."
93706,keram,2007-07-13 17:43:00,585,"Thanks for advice guys.   Yes, I will have a boat, and I'm targetting..........  :dunno:  , so many species to chose. Oh, I know, I will be targetting everything  :thumbsup_anim:  Logo, tape and camera are ready."
93707,addy79,2007-07-13 17:51:00,573,"I know nothing of this area, sorry i couldnt be of more help. good luck!"
94212,John Bacon,2007-07-15 22:07:00,3277,The main species in Baptiste Lake are pike and bass.  Muskies can walleye are a bit more challenging.  The Lake trout are quite hard to come by.  I recommend that you try Dog Bay.  That is the large bay just to the left of the resort.  Try the mouths of of the west and north inlets of the main body of the bay.  Great for pike and bass with a good shot at walleye too.

I just posted some pics on my website  Click here...Baptise Lake 2007  We stayed at Sunrise Lodge aton the NE side of the lake, but where you are is really centrally located on the lake.  Smallies & walleye were deep on jigs, largemouth& pike were in the weeds.    "
