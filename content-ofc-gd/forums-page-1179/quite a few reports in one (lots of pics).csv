94855,pikeie,2007-07-17 03:33:00,380,"ok well we have been having many problems latly with our computer and our memory card reader for our camera. so we fished simcoe on july 1st, then july 7th we fished sparrow, then on july 11th we fished pigeon lake. we have been getting many numbers of fish latly on every trip we go out but we just havent been getting the size we have been looking for   but o well its still fun haha.  july 1st  so on canada day we decided what better way to celebrate our countrys birthday then to go fishing lol. so we were at our cottage on the north end of simcoe and we first decided to go look for some smallies, we only had a few hours to fish today but we wanted to try a shoal that we found earlyer this spring. so we fished it for a bit but the wind started to pick up and the waves were getting bigger. the conditions were not the best. we had a few hits on drop shots and a hit on a senko but we couldnt hook up with them. o well now the wind was fairly strong so went went to a shelterd bay and decided to try for some largemouth. good thing we did!! so we had three hours left to fish and right when we got into the bay fish were jumping everywhere! first we thought they were carp but i was soon convinced they were bass as i saw a nice 3 lbser or so jump right out of the water to hit a frog or somthing else crawling on the weed mats!! so within a 100 yard stretch bass were constanly coming out of the water as well with some HUGE carp eaisly in the 30+ pound range! (one was sitting right under our boat for a few minutes) so while im draging some frogs along the slop mats tinbanger tosses out a senko right into the thick of it, he gets a little tick sets the hook and out comes a very nice largie, after a very nice fight which wraped him in the weeds a few times he gets it in the boat.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1184639514  next i get a little bass probably in the 1 pound range then i get a better one  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1184639640 also caught on a senko lol  my brother hasnt caught any yet but 10 minutes after i catch one he gets his first probably 1 1/2 lbs range. he didnt want a pic, then he gets another and then another! all the same size but it was quick action!!  then i got a hit on the surface and it was a huge boil!! i set the hook and got one jump out of her then it shook the hook free, the fish didnt come compleatly out of the water but from what i saw and felt it was definatly 4+ and maybe 5 lbs man i was ticked!! o well.  my brother gets another hit and it comes to the boat all coverd in weeds, tinbanger sees the plastic hanging out and gos for the lip, i see him pull his thumb out of the mouht just as fast as he put it in! he says man this bass got teeth lol i look at his thumb and its bleeding pretty good lol, he pulls the weeds away and its a bowfin lol ahaha no wonder he got cut, soon after that the fish bit my brother off.  on the next few casts after that tinbanger pulls in another bass.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1184640395  after that we pull in a few more bass in the 1 1/2 pound range. and my brother hooks into another bowfin about double the size it was huge but it got off at the side of the boat. it was a great 4 hours on the water which we ened catching 10 bass and losing 2 nice ones.   july 7th  so we decided to hit one of our favrioute lakes in serch or some largies agian. we get to the lake and notice lots of boats on the water? we later find out they are prefishing for the tourny the next weekend. o well we will have to deal with the pressure its receving. we go to our first spot, a nice weed bed that slopes to deeper water fairly fast, no fish here so we go into the tick grass, tinbanger throughs out a gambler flapin shad  and is swiming it back when he gets a nice hit. a few nice jumps and the fish is in the boat.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1184641087 this fish was around 3 1/2 pounds not to bad for the first fish.  we start fishing agian and i get a hit, but i miss it (this happend alot this day haha) o well i get a small 1 pound bass and that was it, we start runing and gunning some docks to see what we can pick up. we get some small fish agian then my brother gets a nice fish of someones dock.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1184641378  we start fishing some more docks and can still only pick up some small fish agian, i cast to a dock and start talking to tinbanger for a few minutes, i left my line a little slack, but when i was done i plled my rod to just quiver my worm and i feel no weight, pull the line in and i got bit off stupid pike. we get 2 more small bas and then i get a decent one.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1184641654  after that i get another hit but i lose the fish real fast o well time to go.   july 11th  so me and tinbanger decide to get out for a quick fish in the morning before work. so we get out on the water and we get a nice view.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1184641947  so we fish for the first few hours and nothing much caught but u guessed it, about 10 one pound bas ugh! well i was very susprised at the amount of dead carp all over the place and all of the brown ""dead"" looking weeds? i dont kno whats up with all this. well we head up to the north east end ofthe lake to fish some docks and boat houses. and agian more dead carp, this time they really stink! we get to a boat house and tinbanger pitches under it, he get a hit but he broke his line on the hook set, we thought he had a nice fish, so we turn around and he tell me to thro a worm under it. i do and right when it hits the water a fish jump and takes it, i set the hook and its just a small fish so i thought no way this coulda broke him off, but when he gets in the boat i see my dads senko hanging out of his mouth, with 4 feet of floro trailing behind haha, he must of had a knick in his line thats why it broke lol.  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1184642766 you can see both worms in this picture lol.  so we get about 10 more about this size then i get a bit better one  http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v302/pik...pg?t=1184642825 this measured 15"" and what is the worst part this was about the biggest fish this day   we couldnt find any bigger bass but it was a good day on the water with 22 bas caught haha with avrage lenght of 12 or 13 inches.  sorry for the long read but i have been meaning to write this report for a while."
