93633,boatman,2007-07-13 13:09:00,350,"I just returned from visiting my family in Alberta. Spent a couple days in Calgary and kicked off Stampede week. Then I was off to my parents home on the BC/AB border in the Crowsnest Pass, Alberta.  http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto...0&password=  Crowsnest Mountain  http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto...0&password= More mountains  http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto...0&password=  This is the view in front of my parents home.  I spent three days fishing with my brother. The first day was more of a scouting trip looking for access. The second day we decided to hit the Old Man River above the reservoir. I forgot my camera that day so I don't have any photos except a panorama I took of the river valley the day before. We started the trip fly fishing, but since we both suck and my brother accidentally broke his rod, we switched to ultralight action spinning gear.  http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto...0&password=  Old Man River Valley  Fishing was good for me on the Old Man. I caught two Rainbows (12-14 inches) and my first Bull Trout (8 inches). It was small, but its not every day you catch an endangered species and get to add another species to the life list. I lost three more Rainbows trying to land them (we didn't have a net) and a number of missed bites, short strikes and followers. My brother didn't get a bite.  The following day was short since we only had the morning to fish. We decided to fish the Crowsnest River since it was closer and we didn't want to waste precious fishing anytime. Here are a few misc shots.  http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto...0&password= http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto...0&password= http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto...0&password=  This day my brother had better luck. He caught two small Rainbows and lost a couple trying to land them. I caught a couple more Rainbows, but the highlight was a 16-18 inch Bull Trout. It was a beautiful fish. Unfortunately, my brother was too far away at the time to get a photo so he was released without a photo.  http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto...0&password=  My brother with Rainbow.  And a couple shots of me.  http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto...0&password= http://www.myfishingpictures.com/showphoto...0&password=  It was a great trip. Wish I had more time to fish. However, it was just nice to fish with my brother again. We haven't really fished together since we were kids. This is how I want him to remember me when he's over in Afganistan next year."

93643,Joey,2007-07-13 13:42:00,9122,"Great report.  I've fished around those areas before.  Did you keep any bows.  They are some of the best tasting fish I've ever had.  A frying pan with a bit of butter and garlic, mmm, mmmm!!!  Joey"

93774,setomonkey,2007-07-13 20:45:00,872,"Nice report, I've been around that area, your pictures are great but no picture could do full justice to the scenery.  Mike"
94740,boatman,2007-07-16 22:36:00,350,"No Joey, we didn't keep any fish. As much as I would have like to, those rivers are heavily pressured so I thought it best to let them swim another day. However, if we had of been on a less pressured tributary we would have brought four of those tasty little guys home."
