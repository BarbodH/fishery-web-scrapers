94935,Whopper,2007-07-17 12:17:00,2174,"Take it to a canvas place they should be able to fix you up. Did the same with mine, it was a lot cheaper to have mine modified than to buy another.  Good Luck"
94938,taper,2007-07-17 12:22:00,611,If your talking about a bow mount I would recomend a quick release bracket and remove it when trailering or covered. It saves a lot of bouncing on the motor and nothing there for some one to steal.
94939,Pigeontroller,2007-07-17 12:24:00,2793,Ditto what Taper said!
94960,fishboy,2007-07-17 13:26:00,550,Yep-I agree; have one and it's an easy on/off.

95356,lew,2007-07-18 11:45:00,12767,"You can get your cover modified to fit right over your motor if you want.  Mine was custom made for my boat, including covering the troll motor completely, but then I went for a longer shaft on the motor, so I just took it back and had it modified to fit the new one. It was only about $100 for the adjustment, but certainly worth it.  You may not get the color to match the existing cover perfectly, but it should come pretty close.  "
