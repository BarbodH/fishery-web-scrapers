95319,Moosebunk,2007-07-18 04:44:00,3970,OK for smallies.  Right off the HWY I once accessed with my float tube for a couple hours.  A guy I knew had once said to fish around the island right in front of that access and if the smallies were hanging around they would be right on.  Fishing was OK.  Lots of choices in the vicinity of Net Lake for a variety of species.
