95028,little angler,2007-07-17 16:08:00,128,hey guys i found this muskie lure kicking around in my tackle box i was wondering if anyone could tell me if i troll with it or do i just cast it?Are there any techniques i shouldkeep in mind whne using it thnx in advance littleangler 
95029,Raf,2007-07-17 16:12:00,3495,"you can do either but it's a casting lure.  you can fish it any number of ways, cranked as hard as you can just under the surface, cranked slow.. it will catch anything that swims."
95030,Roy,2007-07-17 16:17:00,13728,"Little Angler, listen to Raf, he knows of which he speaks."
95045,Rizzo,2007-07-17 16:41:00,4754,"Yup, typically for casting, but the biggest musky I ever caught came on an almost identical bucktail while trolling.  Pike and bass love em too.  If you're going for the big game though, make sure you are prepared with bolt cutters, large net, good quality leaders/terminal tackle, heavy pound test line...it never ends.  My suggestion is don't get into musky fishing, get rid of that lure right now (send it to me and I will save you a lot of money )"
95059,John,2007-07-17 17:02:00,2956,What Raf said little angler. Best bit of advice I can give is make sure you sharpen the hooks well if it has been sitting around for a while.....
95062,little angler,2007-07-17 17:10:00,128,thnx guys!!!!the hooks are still really sharp
