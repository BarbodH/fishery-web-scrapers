95158,Greencoachdog,2007-07-17 21:49:00,8163,"  That's ok Bubba doug! Take as long as you want  Alot of these non/seldom/infrequent/one pic wonder posters don't realize how much time and effort goes into posting an ""Epic"" report like I know you're preparing. I for one will wait patiently whilst you work your magic, just give a holler when she's ready."
