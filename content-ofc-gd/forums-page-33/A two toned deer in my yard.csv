1056693,NILS Master Lures,2020-02-24 16:20:00,24,What a unique deer! Thanks for sharing the photos and your experiences. Too cool!
1056909,Out4Trout,2020-03-02 03:26:00,98,Fantastic pics of¬†a rare deer!!
1056928,lew,2020-03-02 20:25:00,12766,The white deer and her fawn are in my yard several times a day¬†now but today I saw a huge wound on the fawns side. Don't know if a coyote grabbed her or what but it's¬†really nasty. It's wide open and at least as big as a man's hand but it's not bleeding and she walks just fine and doesn't seem to be in any pain or distress and is eating well. Kinda hard to see in these pictures but it's on her left side directly in front of her back leg. I tried to enlarge it but don't know how to keep the bigger picture.  
1056935,ketchenany,2020-03-02 22:07:00,3229,Here is a ¬†close¬†¬†up. Hope it works.  
1056936,lew,2020-03-02 22:13:00,12766,"Thanks bud, that shows the injury quite clearly"
1056939,misfish,2020-03-02 23:25:00,29133,Could of been from jumping a wire fence.¬† Hind got caught up and struggled to get over it .
1056940,lew,2020-03-02 23:35:00,12766,"You could be right Brian, guess I'll never know for sure."
1057099,misfish,2020-03-09 20:52:00,29133,"I wish I had of brought my go pro or even my camera this morning Lew . I took a drive up to the parents this morning .¬† Mudder and pop have been feeding the turkeys and deer this winter as they have done since moving up there . When I rolled up over the hill, I almost took out a few on the road . Pulled in the drive, I was greeted by more turkeys . Almost ran 2 over. LOL The path walk down to the feeding area was iced over and pop didn't feel comfortable walking, so I did the chore and headed with a pail of feed for the deer . As I did, they just came out of no where . They knew it was not my pop¬† . They stayed back a bit, stomping their hooves in the snow telling me I was not their friend . I made my way down to the feed area slowly just watching for more to come out . I reached the area for dropping the feed and just stood there . There was a young one that really didn't know what the difference was and came right out and down to the feeding area .¬† He/she knew I had some feed . Was so cool .When the young one came to close, the doe stomped and the young one retreated . I laid the feed down and just stood there .¬† The leader of the group just stood back and gave me the stare down ( Like she was looking down the sight, instead of me at her ) . I was not moving til I had one deer come to the feed . One did for a short taste, then once again, the stomp and retreat . I gave in,¬† I was not the feeder and was not welcome . I walked back up the path¬† and they walked their way to the feed .  The lead doe never took her eyes off of me . Yes, she would dip her head for a quick nibble, but back up quick looking right at me . Before I was able to reach the top of the path, I hear my pop whistle . He told me he could walk out, not see them , give a whistle and see them come running down the hill side . Well,¬† while I was standing there , he whistled to ensure they were safe I guess . They, the deer , raised their heads and looked at him . What are you, the deer whisper ? I was at awe and can say ( no I am not a P3TA guy ) this was one of those man/ nature things, that just gets ya thinking .I only thought for a moment, as the¬† thought of how I miss venison sausages . It was a spectacular moment, I must say."
1057100,lew,2020-03-09 21:15:00,12766,You did today what I do every day Brian and really glad to hear how much you enjoyed it. 
1057101,misfish,2020-03-09 21:28:00,29133,"To¬† pat one on the head like my pop does, that would of been the top Lew ."
1057102,lew,2020-03-09 21:41:00,12766,I've got a feeling your gonna visit your Pop again very soon¬† LOL
1057103,misfish,2020-03-09 21:45:00,29133,He is on his last bag of feed . Time for them to get back to what nature offers .
1057106,lew,2020-03-09 22:38:00,12766,"Yup, I hear you, I'm about done myself."
1056413,lew,2020-02-15 19:33:00,12766,A week ago there was a deer in my yard that was half white & half brown but she disappeared before I could get my camera. Just an hour ago I looked out and she was here again but she started to head back into the woods but I was able to get this picture from the rear but you an see the two colors very clear. Pretty kool looking critter and certainly nothing I've ever seen before. Hopefully I can get a better shot if she returns. Just ignore the big ole turkey trying to hog the picture LOL 
1056414,misfish,2020-02-15 20:11:00,29133,Nice shot of the turkey Lew . Got yer own wild life zoo.
1056417,OhioFisherman,2020-02-15 20:42:00,6623,"Cool, unfortunately someone will think it would make a great trophy?"
1056419,lew,2020-02-15 20:47:00,12766,"Yeah, sadly¬†your right Paul, if it's unique someone will think it should be hanging on his wall."
1056425,cisco,2020-02-16 01:02:00,597,Nice pic of a piebald deer. Be nice to see eye coloration re degree of albinoism.¬†Not complete albino but extremely rare. Genetic weaknesses may take this doe earlier than normal plus the white will be easier to see from a predator or hunter vantage. May have similar young. Your area is shotgun/archery only I think with fairly abundant residences with less hunting going on so she may live long. Coyotes are getting thick so they probably pose biggest threat in your area Lew IMO.
1056427,lew,2020-02-16 01:34:00,12766,"Thanks Chris, never heard that term before but good to know some info on them, seem like they're quite rare. She has a young one with her but her markings are normal."
1056431,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-16 03:03:00,8243,"And here I thought we lived in a wildlife refuge. Nothing compared to your zoo big guy. I have seen hundreds of black and white Deer out here. They say Moooo rather than grunt. I am a bit of a citiot expert concerning aminals. I once bought a new pair of Cowboy boots to go to the Binbrook fair many years ago, I asked Ticha ""What's that stuff hanging off that humongous Lambs arse."" In between all the guffaw's of others she told me ""That's not a Lamb stupid it's a sheep and those are his balls."" Then of course I had to ask what the difference is it between a Lamb and a Sheep. Ya don't know till ya know."
1056498,lew,2020-02-18 22:17:00,12766,For anyone that may be interested this deer was here again today and I got a couple better pictures but still not great as she was quite a ways away at the far end of my yard.    
1056499,misfish,2020-02-18 22:33:00,29133,Get yourself a trail cam Lew . You will get great shots at that feeder. Put in on that ceder you trimmed the branches on. I enlarged the pic and didn't see the 2nd deer. Very cool bud.
1056500,lew,2020-02-18 22:45:00,12766,"I've actually thought about a camera Brian, there's always some interesting critter wandering thru the yard."
1056501,misfish,2020-02-18 22:48:00,29133,The night time shots will surprise you I am sure . They are easy to use. Just remove the SD card and plug into a camera and on the computer.
1056502,lew,2020-02-18 22:51:00,12766,"Thanks Brian, sounds interesting."
1056503,ketchenany,2020-02-18 23:53:00,3229,It‚Äôs there B. Just like the alarm lol. Great shot Lew 
1056504,LostAnotherOne,2020-02-19 00:04:00,956,Really like your feeding setup Lew.¬† We've have the same family of Blue Jays live in the pines for almost five years.¬† They know when the back door opens up they are going to get feed.
1056508,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-19 02:36:00,8243,"Amazing, I have never heard of let alone seen what Cisco referred to as ""Albinoism."" Thank you for the amazing photos you get at your place. Did I say amazing?¬† An article explaining ""Abinism"" in White Tail Deer. Albino, all white is something like 1 in over 30,000 Deer. A ""Piebald"" Deer is partially white. One thing I love about OFC is I can learn more than 1 thing everyday. And it keeps my noggin from going to mush. Thanks again Lew. https://www.deeranddeerhunting.com/content/blogs/dan-schmidt-deer-blog-whitetail-wisdom/just-rare-albino-deer"
1056513,SirCranksalot,2020-02-19 13:31:00,3291,OK---it's a new day so here's something new for you---That wasn't a 'sheep' you saw. That was a ram!!!üòÅüòâ
1056521,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-19 16:36:00,8243,An L.A. Ram?
1056525,Rodbender,2020-02-19 22:21:00,1027,Nice Lew I'd like a better pic of the fawn looks like really dark possible Melnistic ?
1056526,lew,2020-02-19 22:29:00,12766,"If you look at the left side of the very 1st¬†picture at the top of this page from last Saturday you can see the fawn much clearer, at least part of her, and you'll see she's not as dark as she appears in the other pictures. There's quite a few fawns around here and she's about the same colour as the others and she's always with the Piebald Deer."
1056555,lew,2020-02-20 20:46:00,12766,This pretty lady is¬† becoming a regular in my yard now and I got a couple good shots today.     
1056563,misfish,2020-02-20 23:02:00,29133,"Awesome Lew.¬† If thats the same fawn, then thats the mother.  And whats with¬† that turkey ? Hey,look at me . Hey,I am right here. "
1056565,lew,2020-02-20 23:45:00,12766,"It's hard to keep track of those Gobblers some days, there's so many of the silly things LOL   "
1056590,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-21 19:40:00,8243,"Now I'll post this in the right thread. I sent the pics to my cousin in the States. His group has a hunt camp in Western NY and they take young folks from the inner cities of Niagara Falls and Buffalo NY there to teach them safe gun handling and ethical hunting with emphasis on proper environmental stewardship. He asked me to thank you for the fantastic pics of the Piebald Deer (the new word of the week, maybe month.) He has never seen 1 either after 50 years of hunting."
1056595,Rattletrap2,2020-02-21 20:31:00,1652,"That is so cool Lew! In the one shot, there was a squirrel at the Doe's feet and now all those turkey's! All these creatures hanging out together to get some feed. We had an albino deer near our work quite¬† a few years ago in the Clairville Conservation area, but have not seen any for a few years now."
1056633,Sinker,2020-02-22 14:29:00,8692,Very cool Lew. Its amazing the wildlife you have there.  S.
