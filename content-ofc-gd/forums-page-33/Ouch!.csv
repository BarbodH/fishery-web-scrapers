1057199,crappieperchhunter,2020-03-12 17:45:00,2582,Looks gnarly. Pike fishing from shore when we where kids. My buddy and I and his younger brother. Â Gabbing and not paying attention my buddies brother went behind us to get something out of his tackle box just as I was casting and a buried a treble hook from my rapala in the back of his skull. Â No crying or carrying on as these brothers where farmers. We just jumped on our bikes and pedalled to the Fergus hospital about a mile away. I can still see my fluorescent orange rapala swinging off the back of his head as we travelled along. Got to the hospital and they shaved a good sized patch on his head bald so they could remove the hook. Within an hour we where fishing again. This was 40+Â years ago I assume Neils parents where contacted but no parents came to the hospital while this was going on. Â I can't imagine it would be handled the same way today.

1057212,Rizzo,2020-03-13 00:13:00,4754,"yup I cringed. Seen it happen to a fewÂ people, but never personally experienced it (thankfully)"
1057215,Crimsongulf,2020-03-13 01:36:00,294,Way back when I got hooked in the ear with a Devils Horse top water plug by a buddy.Â  This was sent to me a while back and I will take any fish hook over this.
