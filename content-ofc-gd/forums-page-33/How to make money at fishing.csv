A shore spot I fish in Bobcaygeon has the usual amount of garbage left by those too lazy to pick up after themselves. Last summer I started taking a shopping bag and cleaning up while I was there.  Lots of beer and cooler cans some weekends. Saved all the empties $$$ in a jar. Had over $30 by winter, enough for 3 bottles of the wine we enjoy.  I'm not getting rich but I'm having fun with it."
