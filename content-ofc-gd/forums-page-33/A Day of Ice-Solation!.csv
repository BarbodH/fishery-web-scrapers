1057588,David Chong,2020-03-20 00:49:00,836,"With all the uncertainty in the world today, I decided on some self-imposed ice-solation, trying to get another crack at Lake Simcoe before ice-out! The ice was still in good shape 15'-16"", even the shoreline although I'm sure that it will deteriorate quickly! My ice-solation day was spent with a friend and his son plus another friend and his two step sons. The weather was excellent, at least until the wind picked up at the end of the day! We caught enough nice fish for a couple of meals and the kids had a great time! Not sure how many more days on frozen lake Simcoe are left, might try to sneak out for another ice-solation day! Be careful out there, watch the shoreline ice!        "
1057589,Terry,2020-03-20 00:53:00,14456,Great way to spend a day during these crazy times  what. No Livescope perspective on that garmin

1057594,captpierre,2020-03-20 01:42:00,2521,Is that a cloud ofÂ perch on the graph or minnows?
1057603,David Chong,2020-03-20 08:47:00,836,Pretty sure it was a school of herring!
1057607,misfish,2020-03-20 11:07:00,29133,Nice David. Some sweet perchy candy and smiles . I may look at a spot in the morning. 
1057630,Fish Farmer,2020-03-20 15:39:00,2234,"Watch the thin spots Bro I'm starting the healing process now, hope I can get the boat out and get in it.ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜…"
1057732,Rizzo,2020-03-22 16:53:00,4754,wow some real nice perch there!
1057745,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-22 20:11:00,8243,"The smiles of the little ones says it all. I hope the ice is gone soon, planning a trip to Georgina for perch next month which isn't far off. "
1057749,misfish,2020-03-22 20:35:00,29133,"Bring yer cleats ,,,,,,,,,,,"
1057765,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-23 02:23:00,8243,"That much ice Brian? Not a single cube here on Erie. We have perch too, just hard to find in April. I will take a drive and see where all the boats are jammed up like the 401 when it had traffic. HTHM and I went one spring and did well. Might have been in May. Had to be 50 boats jammed next to one another outside Burwell or was it Bruce?"
1057793,misfish,2020-03-23 15:13:00,29133,"That side of the lake this year made ice way better then this side. There was reports guys still out on ATV,s chasing the yella bellies. 18-14 inches of ice ."
1057812,David Chong,2020-03-23 20:02:00,836,"I've been in 3 different areas over the last few days and there is 10-15"" of black ice all the way into shore in those areas! There are areas of the lake where the shoreline ice is eroding quickly, be super cautious in those areas especially as things can change while you are on the ice! Stay Safe out there!"
1057844,LefroyFisherman,2020-03-24 00:13:00,602,Shoreline pretty sketchy Innisfil beach side and down
1057846,misfish,2020-03-24 00:18:00,29133,"Why I have decided to put away the ice gear David and brought out the waders and long rod til open water gets here . Will float on my toon when the time comes for some yellas bellies and whities,when the season opens again.  Be safe all "
