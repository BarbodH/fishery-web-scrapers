It was cold but sunny and the wind wasn't nearly as bad as they called for plus the fishing was pretty good! Some great weights brought it by the top ten teams. My partner, Al Russell & I were lucky enough to win ""Big Fish"" of the event, unfortunately we were a fish shy of a limit, leaving us in the also-ran division! LOL The Jumbo weighed in a 1.765 lbs. came on a Jigging Rap and set an event record for ""Big Fish""! Slab Grabbers also played a key role in our bag. Great event that raised a lot of money to help people suffering from MS and research but Doug Poirier the creator and organizer of this event announced that this would be the last year for this event. His deteriorating health for MS makes it difficult for him to continue running it, hopefully someone picks up the reins. Kudos for Doug and all his volunteers for hosting a phenomenal event. Congrats to everyone in the top 10, I didn't get a list son you can check www.perchinforms.com for them later, of course there were the usual suspects up there!"
