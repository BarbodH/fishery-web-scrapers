1056973,akaShag,2020-03-04 01:33:00,2073,"More thoughts to answer Cliff's questions: I have driven this (legally, I think) along the side of the road.  It takes up a LOT more room than an ATV, and with the tracks on most shoulders would not be wide enough, ie you would be driving partly on the road and/or partly in the ditch. You will almost certainly need a bigger trailer than you have for an ATV. They are a fun rig to drive, and if you like attention when you pull in to a Canadian Tire or LCBO parking lot, for example, most times you will have somebody come on over and ask you about it. And they are PRICEY.  But then so are snowmobiles these years, and where I live the snowmobilers pretty much have to go someplace else to drive their sleds. HTH Doug"
1056974,Out4Trout,2020-03-04 02:56:00,98,Nice Rig - and lots of great info Doug!! Did a 400ft hill (with ~60% grade) factor into the decision on buying this machine? Len
1056975,Big Cliff,2020-03-04 09:53:00,6899,"Doug I can't thank you enough for all this information, I really, really appreciate it and all the other replies and suggestions! I am starting to think you are right, an Argo just isn't going to compensate for old age lol, the rough ride and potential to get REALLY stuck (the young at heart in me would have to find out what it won't go through at least a few times). I guess I   might have to start doing a little less exploring and accept this old nonsense. I might just take a drive down to visit you this spring just to buy you a coffee and say hi, I love to hook up even for an hour. Tight lines and stay safe. 😊"
1056987,akaShag,2020-03-05 15:17:00,2073,"Nope, the ATVs can climb the mountain with no problems.  BUT!  They don't float, and are not worth a hoot in snow over about ten inches or so.  They also don't go into some of the real gnarly bush and rocks where deer seem to go to die.  😉"
1057014,DanD,2020-03-06 13:09:00,2223,"Just thinking out of the box here; you have a quad right? If so maybe get a 12 or 14 foot tinny, with a 9.9 on the back. A tilt & load trailer that you can customize for on & off road use (oversize balloon tires, rollers instead of bunks ect). Why a tilt and load trailer; you really don't need a ramp to launch or retrieve your boat with one. When I had my 14' tinny; I'd launch it in the Thames river, from the bank and never got the wheels wet on the trailer. Yes that could mean a pick up to load the quad onto and to hook the boat to for highway use. Or it is legal to double trailer tow here in Ontario. I haven't read all of the regs on doing this; but what I did read was you cannot go over the towing capacity of the tow vehicle with both trailers attached.  There are other ways that you can carry/tow both toys. A hitch mount quad carrier with side loading ramps, a ball mount receiver attached (welded) to the back of the carrier, a weight distribution hitch to carry the tongue weight of the boat trailer. A nice small package to go down the road with? Just thinking out-loud? Dan."
1057019,DRIFTER_016,2020-03-06 16:17:00,10439,They don't float but with tracks the'll go through almost anything. They also have more ground clearance than an Argo. But there is that non-floating thing.
1057020,DRIFTER_016,2020-03-06 16:19:00,10439,I'm planning on a side by side with a roof rack to haul a tinny on. With tracks it will be very capable and can go most places. 
1057030,Fisherman,2020-03-06 20:36:00,7201,"That is certainly a viable option and cheaper.  Once the track kit is installed going back and forth between tires and tracks and pretty easy, just don't try swimming."
1057147,KawarthaAngler,2020-03-10 19:53:00,273,A fishing buddy of mine has one.  I've been in his and it's a rough ride.  But that thing will go anywhere and the fact that it floats is great peace-of-mind. Here's a pic of his.  
1057153,CRAPPIE,2020-03-10 21:49:00,213,How about a Wilcraft?
1057154,akaShag,2020-03-10 22:02:00,2073,"Well, I had to look that up, never heard of one before.  Very cool indeed.  BUT it looks like it would be useless in deep snow.  The hull would bottom out and there is not much ground clearance.  The Argo has the same issue unless it is equipped with tracks - a wheeled Argo is about done in eight inches of snow - you get high centred and can't move.  Been there, done that........🙄 Doug"
1057166,Big Cliff,2020-03-11 14:31:00,6899,I am guessing that would be about the same in thick mud too then?
1057167,Terry,2020-03-11 14:38:00,14456,A Wilcraft is useless in Canada
1057168,akaShag,2020-03-11 14:58:00,2073,"I have never been high-centred in mud, but if it was soupy, then yes I think a wheeled Argo would bog down in that.  Bogs are bad, because you are sometimes in water and sometimes on clumps of dirt, and if you get high-centred on a clump and all wheels in the water, you're screwed.  If I was going to go through a bog/swamp, I would bring an anchor on a length of rope.  If I got high-centred, I would throw the anchor as far as I could and use anchor rope as a winch strong point.  It would be messy.........."
1056631,Big Cliff,2020-02-22 14:15:00,6899,"Our primary use would be two guys accessing small back woods lakes to go fishing and fishing from it. We could encounter all sorts of stuff; muskeg, weeds, ice on the lake deep snow, just about anything you can imagine and stuff I wouldn't even try to take my ATV through. My son has been wanting one for years now but I've had some concerns: Can you drive it where you would normally drive an ATV, i.e down the shoulder of the road (where ATVs are permitted). Just how good/or bad would it be to fish from once you reach the lake. I realize that it would be a lot slower going down the road than my ATV would be but how is the ride? If you owned one, did you get as much use out of it as you thought you would before you bought it? If any of you have owned/used one I would really appreciate any and all feed back, 6 wheel, 8 wheel, tracks or not..... I have been reading everything I can find on them, some reviews are great, some not so (I wonder if some of the really good ones are biased). One thing I do know is that any reviews I get from you guys are going to be honest! It seems that there were a lot of improvements made in the 2019 models, they all sound to be really progressive, improvements to the steering, instrument panel. Any questions I should be asking? This would be a big investment for me so any help would be much appreciated!"
1056632,Sinker,2020-02-22 14:22:00,8692,"I've only ever been a passenger in one, on the ice, in winter. It was decent, but slow. The ride was brutal. Everything got banged around, including passengers.  Other than that, they go anywhere you point them. I know a few guys who use them for moose hunting, with tracks, and there's almost no stopping them.  S."
1056638,Big Cliff,2020-02-22 14:59:00,6899,"Thanks Shane, I was kind of wondering about that, my back is bad already, getting pounded around for an hour or so wouldn't be much fun! My ATV has independent suspension and adjustable shocks so it's a pretty smooth ride. Mind you sitting on the seat in some of those little boats we use for a couple of hours is pretty hard on the back anyway 😊"
1056640,Sinker,2020-02-22 16:13:00,8692,A side by side with a roof rack for the boat would be my choice. Then get some of those clamp on the bench seats for your back. S. 
1056641,porkpie,2020-02-22 16:14:00,2521,"Same scenario,  I’ve never owned one but a neighbour on the lake our family cottage is at owns one and has tracks for the winter. I’ve had a few rides across the lake in winter but never been on a trail with one.    It goes pretty good with tracks.  I can only imagine it would be a bit jarring over rough terrain.  I did know a guy who owned an older model although I never rode in his I do know he was always repairing something before moose season.  He was a pretty handy guy so it wasn’t an issue for him.  I sure wouldn’t mind a tracked argo for the winter but they are fairly cumbersome units."
1056644,Fisherman,2020-02-22 17:07:00,7201,"Well, the Good, the Bad and Ugly.  I had a 6x6 Bigfoot, complete with windshield, wipers, canvas top, outboard bracket and tracks and winch.  The Ugly, Got it second hand with low hours and it needed a bit of TLC, mostly wiping out the inside from having been put away wet, the carb needed a rebuild, dirty gas and gum.  Briggs & Stratton engine was a bit of a birch at times,  the throttle mechanism didn't have an accelerator pump so you couldn't give it full gas and go, it would stutter a bit and then go.  Once I figured that out, it was ok.  It also needed 3 new axle bearings,  easy enough to remove and replace,  they are a common size.  The Bad, well they can be a bit of a rough ride, you have to learn not to go over the rough ground at warp speed.  Add a gel cushion and it's remarkably better.  On flat ground they are fine.  The Good,  darn things near unstoppable unless you really want to bury it somewhere with a dead body in it, lol.  With the standard width track I never got stuck either, it would pretty well float on the snow.  For glare ice, there is a cleat kit for the tracks, gives more steering response.   The newer ones have a lot of upgrades in steering, brakes, alternator output, etc.  Why did I get rid of mine?  They are not allowed on club ATV trails, they don't fall under the 4/6 wheel ATV bracket that the clubs pay landowner insurance for.  Mine was plated/insured, etc and never had a problem driving down the side of the road to get onto Simcoe, local PD guys looked smiled and said carry on.   If you go with tracks, remember it will effect trailer width,  if you have an enclosed trailer,  figure out how you're going to get out unless you want to climb over stuff. "
1056648,grimsbylander,2020-02-22 20:32:00,3016,"I did work for Argo and spent time in the factory talking to the manufacturer about them. Short story, they are good at a lot of conditions but not great at any. They float, but are a poor substitute for an old 12’ aluminum boat. Same for land...four wheelers of side by sides are far superior...even with a trailer behind.  	Think about what you need it to do. If you need one vehicle for multiple tasks, an Argo is an excellent option."
1056659,chris.brock,2020-02-23 01:33:00,4053,"I'd somehow spend some time test driving one in various conditions before laying out that kind of money to buy one, there's probably a reason there's way more ATVs and sleds out in the bush instead of argos"
1056663,Big Cliff,2020-02-23 09:49:00,6899,"Thanks guys, this is all helping! The biggest problem for me is that at 74 I am  finding it hard to do things like wrestling even the little 30 lb Honda onto the back of a little tinny back in the bush. Loading and unloading all the gear into and out of the boat and stuff like that. I don't have the agility and balance I had even a few years ago lol. 10 or 15 years ago roof racks or trailers would have been no problem, heck two years ago I could even manage to lug the 15 hp and put it on the boat but I am afraid those days are just memories. Getting old isn't for sissys lol I would love to test drive one for a weekend under the same conditions that I would be using it anyone got one they would rent me for a weekend?"
1056679,DRIFTER_016,2020-02-24 01:55:00,10439,Why not talk to your local dealer? They might well have one you could test drive.
1056681,ketchenany,2020-02-24 02:22:00,3229,For a weekend? And test it!
1056682,DRIFTER_016,2020-02-24 02:26:00,10439,Yes. You'd be amazed what dealers will do to get a sale. 
1056735,dave524,2020-02-25 22:34:00,4508,One of these in your budget ? https://dirtwheelsmag.com/polaris-releases-the-rampage-a-truly-amphibious-machine/amp/?fbclid=IwAR3YjsVS-KiWAvIkc12Uq0TOnkmWvBD-v1ViaJZ536eebzII7Vw6-ZWU7U0
1056737,Fisherman,2020-02-25 23:08:00,7201,"Made by Polaris, I'd bring a back up snowmobile of another brand.🤣"
1056739,Big Cliff,2020-02-25 23:44:00,6899,Do I ever wish I had the budget for that thing 😁
1056750,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-26 05:36:00,8243,"I know nothing about Argo's except they haven't made the playoffs for a few years. The question I have is that you mentioned being able to drive a ATV on the shoulder of the road. I know it's illegal here in Haldimand county. How do I know? My next door neighbour got a ticket for it. The OPP were out in force in cottage country here on Erie and they had a zero tolerance day. They were ticketing golf carts as well. No plate, no drive. Some weekends out here there are more golf carts and ATV's on the road than cars."
1056782,Big Cliff,2020-02-26 21:17:00,6899,"Well I  did talk to a dealer in Sturgen Falls,  they can't rent me one because of insurance  (test drive in their parking lot only) however they did tell me I can rent one through Sturgeon Rental  so I  will be doing that this spring."
1056786,misfish,2020-02-26 22:42:00,29133,"Kiddy up go daddy,giddy up go."
1056787,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-26 23:32:00,8243,"Way back in 2011 when I pulled the trigger for my 1st brand new vehicle I've ever  bought for myself in the 40 years (I lie, my wonderful wife bought it for me) I have been buying cars, bikes and trucks the sales manager let us take a demonstrator over night to test drive, not the 1st time that has been done by me. The biggest financial investment a working person will make is buying a home. I've always said we get to test drive a vehicle but after a 30 minute walk around we have to decide to make the biggest purchase in our lives. I suggested to an agent years ago that a perspective buyer should be able to spend a night in the home, they have started to do just that for real estate, about time. I don't know how it works but it's being done and I would be open to it as we have our joint on the market."
1056853,David Chong,2020-02-28 21:30:00,836,Again I've only been in one as a passenger and I thought it was pretty tolerable but that was on some pretty smooth ice so I can't vouch for other terrain. Look forward to your report after trying one out!
1056967,Out4Trout,2020-03-03 21:47:00,98,"If I am not mistaken, our buddy Doug (member AkaShag) owns one... he may be able to help you on pros / cons / general experience https://ontariofishingcommunity.com/profile/23744-akashag/"
1056968,Fisherman,2020-03-03 22:36:00,7201,"Hahahaha, I remember the one Doug owned about 20 years ago, man did he have a bunch of headaches with that one.  Much older version that had roll pins in the axles, one snaps and slowly all the others go and then the tires won't turn.  spent many an hour fixing that thing,  new ones are far more reliable with splined axles.  Had a mechanical fuel pump that was shot too."
1056969,Out4Trout,2020-03-04 00:39:00,98,Sounds like fun...I think he has a newer Argo now... OP can reach out to him directly.
1056970,Fisherman,2020-03-04 01:21:00,7201,"Yes, 2016 or 17,  8 wheel with tracks, nice machine."
1056971,akaShag,2020-03-04 01:24:00,2073,"Fisherman sent me an e-mail asking, somewhat incredulously, if I bought another Argo.  Guilty as charged.  Then I went looking for this thread.  (You could have sent me a link, buddy............) I did own one many moons ago, an 8 wheeler with the so-called Super Tracks (extra wide).  It cost me several hundred dollars for every kilometer I ever drove it.  But I am not in any way mechanically inclined so could not do any of the work it needed. I did fish out of it a number of times.  It is very bow-heavy and if you have two men in the front seat you don't have much freeboard.  Unless you put a kicker motor on it, your propulsion is just the tires, so excruciatingly slow.  I did have a motor bracket, AND a bilge pump! With the tracks yes you can go just about anywhere, but once you are stuck, you are well and truly bogged.  I got bogged in slush about half-way up the hull one time, and that was a very exciting adventure indeed.  The young lad (Drew) that runs a tackle shop in Owen Sound still has nightmares about it...😉 There is no suspension, just the tires, so it is not a smooth ride over bumps and obstacles.  This is the case both with and without the tracks mounted. BUT!!!!!  they FLOAT, so if a person is ice fishing and goes through the ice, you are not going to drown.  You may die of hypothermia, but the bodies will be easy to find. The new models are a huge improvement over the old ones, much less inclined to break down.  You can mount a winch both on the front and on the back for gnarly spots, but of course there has to be something solid to hook up the winch cable. I decided to buy this new one because of the safety factor for ice fishing, and because it is VERY handy around my hunting property.  I can generally drive right up to a dead deer and just lift it into the back end. Cliff, I don't really believe this is the rig for you, but by all means if you want to drive one, come on down to Kingston and be my guest. Doug"
