While it is worse in South Oshawa than other places, unfortunately, this problem is not limited to Oshawa. There wasÂ a murder near here this summer, by a swarming gang of teen thugs. Guy was found in the St Lawrence river. The drugs that are around today are a scourge on our society. I agree with the OP in his statement about not being alone, but I would add, day or night. "
1038653,Old Ironmaker,2019-01-03 06:39:00,8243,Sorry to hear that Chris. But I can't get my head around any cover up of 3 civilian's. What would be the purpose?
1038805,chris.brock,2019-01-07 02:48:00,4053,The purpose would be respect for the deceased and the family of the deceased. It's a bad stigma if someone dies from a drug overdose. I totally get that and don't blame them for keeping the details to private.
1038859,smitty55,2019-01-08 00:55:00,928,Things are getting scary down in Athens are they Len?
1038861,AKRISONER,2019-01-08 01:31:00,5558,"Not such great advice, because in 99.9% of situations in Canada any culprit would not be carrying a firearm themselves and as such if you were to god forbid pull the trigger you would be finding yourself facing a first degree murder charge. Especially because you have clearly brought the weapon with you wherever you have gone. its no different than carrying a knife. I know plenty of people who carry a knife on them. They donâ€™t realize that if they ever use it on someone they will be getting an attempted murder / murder charge. i hope the police do their jobs effectively to stop the problem. If you choose to turn a blind eye though and be complacent you are potentially part of the problem. I understand that most of us feel that we can hold our own, but perhaps some neighborhood kids go for a bike ride or hike down the wrong path. We all have a job to be dilligent. im on a streak now of 6 consecutive trips through barrie stopping at either the Wendyâ€™s on Fairview or the shell on Bayfield and witnessing, drug dealing,Â prostitution, police standoffs and general tweaking by junkies making a scene."
1038870,ch312,2019-01-08 14:51:00,1590, You sure about that one?
1038872,AKRISONER,2019-01-08 15:15:00,5558,"yes, the act of carrying a knife and using it on someone immediately comes with the catch of it being premeditated. You can use items from the environment to defend yourself, but the fact that you are carrying a deadly weapon and then subsequently use it on a person means you were carrying the knife with the intent to use it to hurt someone. I am sure the court would hear you out if you were carrying a leatherman while fishing and used it to defend yourself after you got jumped by a junkie in the bushes...but if you carry a knife with you to the bar and decide to get in a fight and use the knife...you are toast."

1056914,AKRISONER,2020-03-02 12:55:00,5558,"synthetic drugs crystal meth and fentanylÂ have basically put that group of society at the edge. The epidemic spread through the midwest of the United States in the early 2000's. Its just made its way to Canada. Theres really no end in sight to it unless we either enforce harsher drug trafficking laws or they all kill themselves off. I lived in the downtown east side of vancouver where they had close to 1,000 people die from fentanyl overdose in 2019. Theres only 20,000 users total in the area. If 1,000 die per year it seemingly cleans itself up. Crazy enough the death rate has actually finally started to decline in BC because the users have basically overdosed themselves off. Long gone are the days of the ""local drunk"" in small towns. Now you have guys that havent slept in a week with super human strength running around stealing and doing anything to ensure their next fix. Its scary as hell. The beauty of all of this is that Toronto's gun crime problems are also directly related to it. The guys selling all of this crap are the ones shooting each other on our streets."
1056920,dave524,2020-03-02 16:43:00,4508,"Heard it said, maybe 30 years ago in the US, if the FBI was really serious about getting rid of the drug problem, the next time they grab a big shipment of drugs they would lace it with cyanide and let it back out on the street, simple supply and demand, no users ->no dealers. On the gun crime thing, since the 70's I was involved in protesting useless gun control, one figure that always stood out was 51% of murderers were previously known or had records with the police and 49% of victims also had records, probably not too different today, bad guys shooting bad guys."

The problem is that they shot up the front door of my building. Then another time they had a big shootout across the street and hit a poor lady in the head in front of her 4 childrenÂ ðŸ˜”

Anyone who fishes there alreadyÂ knows soÂ this isÂ for anyone who doesn't..... I strongly recommend fishing in groups only, and avoid darkness if you are fishing in south Oshawa. I've had some scary experiences this fall and I believe I would have been robbed (or worse) if I had not been fishing in a group of four guys. This isn't chicken little stuff, I'm talking three sketchy incidents just yesterday. Be alert andÂ payÂ attention out there guys."

1038325,Canuck,2018-12-26 18:59:00,491,"If this is happening, why wouldn't you report it to the Police so they can go down in the evening and see for themselves?Â  If you report the issue and sayÂ that you think kids may be in danger, they won't be able to ignore it."

1038329,aplumma,2018-12-26 19:51:00,6896,Please no specific locations or illegal practices posted here. As we all know Canada does not allow pistols or open carry so discussing it from the USAÂ  point of viewÂ will do nothing but get this locked. I am sorry that fishing in some areas is dangerous not from wildlife but from our own kind. If you identify an area andÂ enough people call the police it might get extra patrols or surveillance to calm it down. You should check with your local jurisdictions and see what personal protection is legally available to use in a dicey situation. One of the first things taught in crime prevention is to be aware of your surroundings and avoid areas that are considered dangerous. If you do go into an area that is dicey go with friends and have a phone handy to call for help.  Thank you Art

1038338,verno,2018-12-27 01:31:00,178," A lot of heavy drug use in the bush around the creek.Â  Desperate drug addicts don't care who they hurt to get their next fix.Â  The Methadone clinic is about 200 meters from the creek down there and the bike path that follows the creek makes a great highway for people that want to stay off the main street and out of sight.Â  The bush surrounding the creek is a Rabbit's warren and there are increasingly bigger tent cities growing in it.Â  Those tent cities attract drug users and those violent people that want to prey on drug users. If you look at the link below the problem is severe enough that the city has converted mailboxes to accept used needles.Â  3 of the locations are along the creek. https://www.oshawa.ca/residents/public-space-harm-reduction-needle-drop-boxes-.asp And its not just your stereotypical junkie either.Â  Our former neighbour who was doing well in life, owned her home and had at least 12 yrs into a mortgage that we lived next to her, worked downtown in the TD IT dept.Â  Died of an OD days after getting out of rehab.Â  She wasn't a violent predator, but I'm sure she had violent predators at her house by the looks of some of the characters I saw before we moved."
