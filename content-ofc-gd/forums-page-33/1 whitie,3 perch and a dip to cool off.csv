We was not sitting for long til it was moving time again and again and again. 11 x to be exact for me. We fished shallow, fished deeper then I like, went shallow and back to deep, til finally,Â  found some fish. There was lots,but they were very tight lipped.Â  Â During 10 am til 11:30, the iceÂ  banged,boomed and shifted like crazy once that east breeze started. Water was sloshing in the holes . Once Lord Simcoe finally calmed down, I was able to hook into 4 fish pretty quick and lose 2 . All with,n a span of 20 minutes. Then it shut down. Screen was white for an hour after . Called it quits . Walking was great. Just ice that required cleats for sure .  	Lord Sim played a little nasty on me once I got back to shore. The area was already sketchy getting on, but doable . When I got back well, not so. It was pick a spot and just get across . Well I picked a spot, shoot the smitty across first. My turn and well, dipdadip I go. Up to my waist . Funny how fast an ole man can jump out when he needs to . LOL Needless to say, this access spot is done . To bad as I was enjoying this new spot to me.  	Ended the morning with a whitie and 3 perch. Missed 2 other whities. On and offÂ  .   Dave fishfarmer walking off in the sunrise .       "

1057176,misfish,2020-03-11 19:20:00,29133,It was giving away everywhere I thought I could cross. Get close to the crack and I could feel the ice giving .
1057177,misfish,2020-03-11 19:30:00,29133,I hope Dave and his pal don't go for a dip. Long drive home for them byes.
1057179,misfish,2020-03-11 20:37:00,29133,Yummy  
1057180,ketchenany,2020-03-11 20:48:00,3229,glad you still got your eggs B. We dropped hut in crack it wasnâ€™t pretty getting it out.
1057183,misfish,2020-03-11 23:21:00,29133,"We all know the newfie jokes so, how many Italians did it take, to get it out ?ðŸ¤£"
1057185,ketchenany,2020-03-11 23:57:00,3229,"8 Italians, 2Â Â ATVs and a snow machine,Â it was an 8x10 and solid . One lesson learned after that Â ScenarioÂ always had 2 8x10 in the hut just in case we met a crack. We were lucky thereâ€™Â was a shelf under the crack. Or it was gonzo! Made for a wet day. Hope you were only waist deep."
