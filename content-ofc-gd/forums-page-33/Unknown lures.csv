1057113,malcolm,2020-03-09 23:36:00,8,"Hi everyone, I'm new to this forum and will need lots of help from the members here. I'm from across the pond, just moved here to Sault St Marie. First question... what type of fishing is best in my area?? Also please give me some idea of the type of traling or where is the best bank fishing?? I also have a few antique lures found in the house i bought. Can I put some pictures on here so maybe you members can give me some idea of their age & what they would be used for?? It is really beautiful here in Ontario. Thanks for all your help in advance.         "
1057128,kickingfrog,2020-03-10 02:27:00,8333,Welcome. I can't help with those lures or the local knowledge. From the fishing shows and magazines just about everything that swims is in your area.
1057129,HTHM,2020-03-10 03:02:00,4082,"Those lures may be worth a fair chunk of change, it appears that you have the original boxes. To a collector those are highly prized. There are others on this board that will be better able to advise you. Welcome."
1057130,Gil Levesque,2020-03-10 11:00:00,103,"Hi Malcomb,wellcome to a great forum. The St.Marys river is a fantastic fishery! As for the lures,check out Patrick Daradick,s website. Www ontariolures.com. Hes the man!! Cheers."
1057131,OhioFisherman,2020-03-10 12:25:00,6623,"Welcome Malcolm, https://www.ebay.com/itm/NICE-VINTAGE-HI-SPORT-LURE-11-25-19POT-FROG/123993438376?hash=item1cde95b8a8:g:h1MAAOSwqwhd4Xle There is a link to one of those lures on ebay, if you have the boxes or names on the lures you can research them there and get a rough idea of their value."
1057134,malcolm,2020-03-10 16:07:00,8,"Good morning everyone, thank you so much for your replies. I think I'm going to enjoy this forum and hope to have lots of talks on fishing & tackle. I mainly have bank fished in Britain but I'm looking forward to lots of lake fishing. I'm only a newbie to the fishing in Canada but enjoyed a trip to Neultin 2 years ago.    "

1057139,misfish,2020-03-10 17:16:00,29133,"Welcome Malcolm,  Did you fly fish over there ? Have watched so many great fly fishing videos from across the pond ."
1057150,malcolm,2020-03-10 21:03:00,8,"Hi Misfish, I did a lot of traling in quite a few lakes in the North of Manitoba Neultin, Windy River and a few others which I can't remember their names. But had a great time."
1057151,misfish,2020-03-10 21:06:00,29133,I meant in Britian . LOL
1057152,malcolm,2020-03-10 21:13:00,8,"Okay, I used to fish on the River Lea most of the time, but did go to Ireland a couple of times and Nrth Yorkshire Scotland."
1057159,akaShag,2020-03-11 12:23:00,2073,Indeed.  I would be doing a bit of research before I let them go.  Good luck. Doug
1057170,malcolm,2020-03-11 15:21:00,8,"Thank you akaShag, that one is not going for much.... I find a lot of ebay buyers are after something for nothing. It's the same on Amazon."
1057172,akaShag,2020-03-11 16:00:00,2073,"I did not look at that link.  My point is that SOME vintage lures fetch good money, and some research would be a good idea.  Please see my pm. Doug"
1057173,OhioFisherman,2020-03-11 16:58:00,6623,"akaShag is right, some of the lures, boxes, and paper work and even old fishing magazines can draw a good price. Ebay is sort of a zoo, you need all the possible info you can get on older stuff there, and condition can be everything. Some of those folks have no real clue about what they list, it's old so it has to be worth a lot? Well not really."
1057186,pike slayer,2020-03-12 00:52:00,1177,I live in the sault. If your looking to target certain fish or areas message me I can lead you in the right direction
1057189,David Chong,2020-03-12 01:51:00,836,"Some nice old lures that you have there! Welcome to the board, lots of knowledgeable anglers here! I don't get up that way very often but I'm sure that someone will have some good advice for you!"
1057196,malcolm,2020-03-12 15:17:00,8,"Thank you pikeslayer, I'll keep you in mind."
1057211,Rizzo,2020-03-13 00:12:00,4754,wow you got some real relics there...welcome
1057225,malcolm,2020-03-13 11:58:00,8,"Thanks Rizzo, they were found in the house I purchased."
1057510,Rattletrap2,2020-03-18 23:04:00,1652,"Welcome aboard Malcolm! I can't help much with the lures value, but personally, I think I would just make up a nice display and keep them. Pike Slayer and others would be a good resource for fishing in your new home area. I spent a fair bit of time working in The Sault back in the '80's and really fell in love with the place! One day, I hope to get back to the area. Enjoy your time on this board. A wealth of information on fishing and a whole lot more! Brian"
1057516,Fish Farmer,2020-03-19 01:25:00,2234,"Hi Malcolm, I'll send you a PM let you know a antique lure collector, he used to be president of the antique lure association. He may be interested in what you have and give you some info."
