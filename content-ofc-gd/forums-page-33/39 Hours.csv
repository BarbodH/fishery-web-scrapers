1056138,Moosebunk,2020-02-07 03:46:00,3970,Agreed! Those fish make me jealous too. lol
1056142,porkpie,2020-02-07 10:49:00,2521,"I’ve liked watching the show.  I’ve always enjoyed uncut angling, enjoys the Castellano fella and Taro Muratta has grown on me.  Conrad brothers are typical Canadian westerners and entertaining to watch.  I have tried hard with the 2 yanks, gone as far as trying to watch their channels outside of this 39 hours and I just can’t do it.  Particularly the Eric guy his constant yelling of “let’s go” and fist bumping of whoever is near him turns me right off.  The Alex kid, he’s not bad just not much personality and I don’t find him very entertaining. I’m sure he’s doing just fine though, so good for him!  Anyhow I’m rooting for the Canadians, any of them!"
1056571,Musky Plug,2020-02-21 05:17:00,398,"Finally got to watch the final two episodes along with the Q&A video after. Some parts were intense, but overall I thought it was a great series. Team Manitoba clutched a few fish that saved them and got them the W. Would've liked to see Taro and Paul win the show but that's fishing. In the Q&A video they did touch on couple things like the fly in fishing and gave a good explanation. All in all I thought it was a great series and looking forward to season 3."
1056572,BillM,2020-02-21 05:28:00,17367,"Liked the show,  really don't understand why the US team decided to chase a bluegill around for two episodes.  I'm sure they're both great fisherman, but that was such a weak showing.   Also, I don't agree at all with the Konrad boys pike that was weighed in.  Ganked right in the side, I don't careif the fish swiped at it or not, hooks gotta be on the head somewhere, lol. Also another pet peeve, show was based out of Canada, 3 out of 4 teams were Canadian, finale was in Winnipeg and all the merchandise sold is in US funds on the website.  I was going to buy a t-shirt and a hat but that came to $31 or so with $21 US shipping.   Nope!  Ridiculous."
1056573,Chuck Enwinde,2020-02-21 05:40:00,247,Been a long time since I've gotten hooked on a TV show but I really enjoyed this.  I was pulling for Paul and Taro but Team Manitoba deserved the win.  Aaron and Jay both fished really well and caught some awesome fish with chips on the table.  The Konrad brothers are just machines.  38 hours in and they're standing on opposite gunnels of the boat like they were born there.
1056594,Rattletrap2,2020-02-21 20:24:00,1652,"The whole series was fantastic! I really enjoyed it all. I was hoping our local boys would pull out a win, but they did just fine. I got to meet Paul Castellano at the fishing show last Sunday which was a pleasure. Aaron Wiebe has been making some awesome videos for a long time, and now that ""Jimmy Seahawk"" is producing, it can only get better."
1056629,Rizzo,2020-02-22 13:32:00,4754,"was a great watch again. Couple buddies of mine actually flew to Winnipeg to be a part of the finale. As they call it... ""full send"". I haven't seen the Q and A part yet, but I know they get a question or 2 in, and get a shout out for wearing our hockey team jersey's that evening...oh ya...and some drinking pictures with the boys after the Q and A was over. Worth a 2 day trip to Winnipeg I guess!"
1056687,AKRISONER,2020-02-24 14:31:00,5558,"Mr Frostbite googan baits was handling the merchandising. His personality take it or leave it but kudos to the kid for turning this stuff into a real business. Kind of the polar opposite of Aaron who wants nothing to do with anything anymore except fishing and his wife. I think the fame has got to him a bit and hes not a big fan of it but hes keeping it up simply to make ends meet. Was cheering for Paul and Taro and I thought they really stood a chance but Manitoba just had one better period when team tacklebox blanked and that was the difference. Was good to see Paul and Taro a bit more engaged this time around, Taro explained to me that the first time they were literally just doing it as a favour to Aaron, but this time it seems like the sponsors made it worth their while to spend 4 straight days doing this. Looking forward to my trip with Taro in July to talk about it more in depth. Im sure season 3 will get done, but im slightly wary of it becoming overblown and sold out like a normal fishing show. The Konrads? What i love about them is they break the fishing down to simple trusted techniques. Dont over complicate it and just read water incredibly. Theres a reason they catch world record caliber fish across multiple species. I would definitely say that this was the best collection of multispecies anglers ever gathered for one ""tournament"""
1056703,BillM,2020-02-24 20:32:00,17367,My thought is the Konrad boys had it easiest out of all the group's.
1056719,Moosebunk,2020-02-25 03:40:00,3970,"This Wednesday is gonna be soooo boring again. Really enjoyed the show, all personalities and the great showcasing of so many fish. Would love to see more but do agree with said above, that too much of it too often and it may get overplayed.  I'd think a good and easier step for these guys for something different, would be to pick some place none have been, that has plenty big fish in a few species, and make some kind of three day tourney out of it. Bill... snagging pike in murky waters is an art.  I'll give 'em the point for ganking, but only on one fish. lol."
1056734,Jds63,2020-02-25 22:29:00,1365,Season 1 and 2 were great . Looked forward to every Wednesday nights release of the next episode. Just hope Aaron will continue to put out more videos.
1056741,Tjames09,2020-02-26 01:21:00,664,"The US teams fishing boat with rods and tackle everywhere drove me bananas. Always stepping on rods, everything tangled. Not to mention fishing for a bluegill and rock bass for 20 hours lol. Meanwhile Konrads out there in a tin boat with one rod each."
1056833,Chuck Enwinde,2020-02-28 10:45:00,247,"The cast got together for some ice fishing on the Red River.  If your in to shenanigans, some of the vids are hilarious.  If you can handle Taro - it's some of his best work lol."
1056843,smitty55,2020-02-28 17:46:00,928,I can't seem to find that. Do you have a link? Tks
1056844,Chuck Enwinde,2020-02-28 19:06:00,247,"There were a few but in this one Taro is taunting Jay while he misses 10 fish in a a row lol.   Turns out Jimmy Seahawk is ""not as peaceful as you think""."
1055495,Moosebunk,2020-01-22 23:25:00,3970,"Yeah... Aaron flew through with High Arctic Lodge. Lucky guy was staying with them for a week, and it's quite the outfit being that every day they fly to a char location to fish.  Alex had missed his original flight out of the USA. By the time he arrived, 4 days of fishing had been lost to his week long trip. Yikes! Anyways, again I really enjoyed Aaron's company. Being that my 5 day trip had fallen on unlucky timing and I was out there alone sometimes dwelling on that difficult fishing, his day three appearance really lifted my spirits. Should be another solid episode tonight."
1055703,Musky Plug,2020-01-26 21:46:00,398,"Finally got a chance to watch episode 3. Thought it was good. Glad Taro and Paul are in the lead but I have a feeling the twins are a sleeper team with the access to those remote lakes. Alex wasn't that bad this time, other than the 10 million rods all over the deck of the boat which drove me nuts. Other than that didn't find him that bad.  I think it also has to do with the new youtube algorithm for monitizing videos. I've seen a few videos from others and they've been complaining about the fact if they swear they could be subject to de-monitizing. Also could be the G rating they're going for too."
1055827,GBW,2020-01-29 23:58:00,8460,Episode 4 is tonight at 8:30 on YouTube
1055852,Musky Plug,2020-01-30 21:16:00,398,Episode 4 I thought was pretty good overall. Good to see Taro and Paul in top spot!
1055897,OhioFisherman,2020-02-01 11:06:00,6623,Some of the same cast of characters.
1055900,Rattletrap2,2020-02-01 13:34:00,1652,"I followed all of Season one a couple of years back and am a huge fan of Aaron and Jay. They do some awesome filming and are true artists at their craft. For the life of me, I can't figure out why Sportsman channel has not picked up these guys! I mean You Tube is great, but they deserve a spot on television. I watch a lot of fishing shows on tv and can't stand ""Fishful Thinking""! Just too much of an ""infomercial""! He can't say two words without mentioning his sponsors products. The host himself is a great fisherman I remember from the old Molson Big Fish contest days in the '80's. I am really enjoying the Season Two episodes."
1055901,AKRISONER,2020-02-01 13:55:00,5558,But what the hell happened with the squirrel?!
1055903,Sinker,2020-02-01 14:59:00,8692,"I don't think they want to be on mainstream TV. They are making plenty of money off youtube, and they can do things the way they want, with no infomercials. I prefer youtube to be honest, TV sucks. Its all fake Bull.  S."
1055904,GBW,2020-02-01 15:26:00,8460,"HAHAHA, I was wondering the same thing. Like who got bit trying to get it out?"
1055915,Rattletrap2,2020-02-01 21:36:00,1652,"You are probably right Sinker! I guess I really have no concept of what You Tube pays. I know they make money based on Views, Likes, and Subscribers....and some ads as well! Who needs a tv network telling you what to say and do? lol"
1055916,AKRISONER,2020-02-01 21:46:00,5558,"I think for them it’s not about YouTube specifically. They aren’t in this to make money. You can tell weibe is making ends meet by his sponsorship deals which allow him to fish. Jay has a successful photography/media business, the Conrads are outdoor power equipment salesmen, taro, Paul and Eric are all guides and AP has business ventures such as fish frostbite and googan baits that are paying the bills. The YouTube stuff is all promo with a bit of cash incentive and definitely is not their primary income source. Hence they don’t just become a tv infomercial even though 39 hours is pushin kalin’s products pretty hard.  taro told me the first 39 hours was just done as a favour for Aaron. He even admitted they never took it seriously because there really wasn’t any sponsorship and actually cost them money to do. It’s good promo for their guiding businesses"
1055952,Sinker,2020-02-02 20:01:00,8692,"There are LOTS of people getting rich off Youtube. Lots. And very rich. These guys are just class acts, and do it because they are passionate about it. Sponsors and advertisers are likely knocking on their doors constantly, but if its not a product they use, and know works well, they turn them down.  Every time an ad shows up on a vid, they are making money. Then theres the sponsorships, and perks from everything else. To say Weibe is barely making ends meet is hilarious.Do you really believe that?  Look into it more.  The average youtuber gets paid $10-$50 per 1000 views. So you figure these guys are all getting hundreds of thousands of views per video, so thats pretty good money when they are putting out a video every week. If that's making ends meet, I'm dirt poor. S."
1055965,AKRISONER,2020-02-02 22:07:00,5558,"You need 50,000 views for a video to start making money. Look at the views for the 39 hours series it’s just over 100k for every video.  Aaron barely releases videos anymore because he doesn’t want to sell out that hard and doesn’t believe in releasing videos just for the sake of it. the pay rate is actually averages less than $5 per 1000 ad views. Aaron was living in his moms house until he got married. He also has released about a video a month average over the past year meaning he made $1,000 a month from YouTube...that’s hardly raking in the dough. He cares more about fishing and having the means to fish than making big dough. I’m thinking frostbite paid him more to put his name on their brand than he’s made the past few years off of YouTube. this set of 39 hours clearly was more organized sponsorship and monetarily wise. Hence the additional planning by all teams.  "
1055974,Musky Plug,2020-02-02 23:32:00,398," Yes, I would agree that there are a lot of people getting rich but I would say that Aaron isn’t one of them. He may be doing well but I wouldn’t say getting rich. Just because you have a channel doesn’t mean you rake in the cash. The only people that I’m aware of that make that kind of money from YouTube in the fishing niche are the Googan kids. I read an article a while ago that the Jon b kid and Rob we’re making approximately $10k american a month. However they were uploading a few times a week with couple hundred thousand views per video."
1055984,OhioFisherman,2020-02-03 10:11:00,6623,The vast majority of Americans would love to make 10k a month!
1055986,Terry,2020-02-03 10:23:00,14456,"Well yeah but you subtract the production cost and pay all the people involved and that 10,000 gets a lot smaller"
1056017,Musky Plug,2020-02-04 00:20:00,398,so would I! lol.
1056018,Musky Plug,2020-02-04 00:22:00,398,"Forsure. When all those guys started they did all the filming and editing themselves. They've only started having other people film and edit over the last couple years, after they had blown up."
1056026,Sinker,2020-02-04 10:28:00,8692,"I think your both bidding way low. I know, for a fact,  of a much smaller youtube channel that's making 200k US a year. It's right there in the math. Nobody watches TV anymore.  S."
1056040,Musky Plug,2020-02-04 17:00:00,398,Agreed. Can you say which Youtube channel it is?
1056049,BillM,2020-02-04 21:03:00,17367,"Youtube is all about ads being clicked, it's not about total # of views...   you can't take views, do some math then come up with the amount that person is making.  Not the way it works.  Now if you've got 100k views and 25k of those views are clicking through your ad base then you're going to see the $$$ role in.   Fishing products is a great way to do this (as is makeup, it's probably the #1)...  People always want the latest and greatest."
1056075,AKRISONER,2020-02-05 12:41:00,5558,i know someone that makes a couple hundred grand a year working for Mac cosmetics. Her job is to manage youtubers...
1056084,Musky Plug,2020-02-05 17:50:00,398, I'm in the wrong line of work. Maybe I should consider career change...
1056105,Chuck Enwinde,2020-02-06 07:57:00,247,SPOILER ALERT!! Pretty crazy brown that the Konrad brothers caught.  The addendum at the end of the show stated that it fell 1 inch shy of the catch and release world record - which is held by Eric Haataja.  These guys got some serious chops.  Really enjoying the series.  Hoping Taro and Paul kill it on Simcoe. 
1056130,BillM,2020-02-06 21:52:00,17367,They should ban triploids from any sort of record books and this show lol!
1053974,Musky Plug,2019-12-21 23:21:00,398,Trailer for the new season. Thought some might be interested.  
1054010,OhioFisherman,2019-12-23 16:08:00,6623,"I didn't know the program existed, I don't usually watch tv programming and refuse to pay for an expensive cable package. An interesting format, watched the first couple of episodes on youtube."
1054034,AKRISONER,2019-12-23 23:32:00,5558,Keep watching Ohio it’s a fantastic hilarious series. Taro is an absolute gem
1054304,David Chong,2019-12-30 21:35:00,836,I'm so glad that they did a second season! there are some great characters in these shows! Lots of laughs and some pretty good fish caught too!
1054811,AKRISONER,2020-01-10 16:33:00,5558,Sad Manny Milas isn’t involved this go around. That guy’s Al Linder impersonation literally makes me die every time.
1054812,David Chong,2020-01-10 16:45:00,836,Manny was a gem! 🤣🤣🤣
1054814,AKRISONER,2020-01-10 16:46:00,5558,"First episode was great. Of course Taro falls in the lake before even getting on the boat for the first time Hahahaa what a guy.  i can confirm, people may think Taro is putting it on because he’s on film...dude is 100% genuinely that wild and hilarious. Fishing with him was an absolute riot and I am planning on going with him again this year."
1054827,David Chong,2020-01-10 20:07:00,836,"Trust me, I know Taro & Paul very well and have fished with both of them There is no act with Taro, that is him through & through! I should post our old FishCity promo from a few years ago, he falls in a lot!"
1054838,Rizzo,2020-01-10 23:24:00,4754,"although I enjoyed it (a bit) some of it was a bit disappointing...such as: - the one team going to a fly-in...a bit unfair - the new format...39 straight hours was awesome last time (and funny). The new format won't be as good imo - the kid Alex from the States saying ""Oh My Gosh"" every 4 seconds was driving me insane...wanted to break the tv"
1054846,AKRISONER,2020-01-11 03:18:00,5558,"The fly in actually isn’t unfair because they have severely hindered their multi species ability by doing it. they basically have walleye, pike, lake trout, grayling , burbot and maybe whitefish  to target? Anything else is going to tough to gain points on. fishing Lake Ontario, erie and simcoe seems far more unfair to me. I agree about the timing change because it made it funnier when they were really really tired, but I get it that it’s a safety issue especially with them driving both boats and trucks around. The sponsors probably wanted nothing to do with them and driving around insanely sleep deprived. you aren’t alone with your feelings about AP bassin, he’s widely disliked by a lot of people, hence they keep referencing it non stop. Aaron weibe makes fun of him a bunch of it too on the frostbite fishing channel."
1054848,smitty55,2020-01-11 04:12:00,928,"I couldn't agree more, even right off the bat with him going to store to buy everything he seemed to grate on me. Best parts by far were those fish caught out of Cree Lake, that made it worthwhile watching."
1054853,cisco,2020-01-11 14:52:00,597,"Alex got there via rich dad or ? Not as good as 1st series. Guides?!?! To even things the Lake O crew should be in a huge charter boat with guides with known techniques for big chinooks, lakers, cohos, bows instead of worrying about waves."
1054854,Musky Plug,2020-01-11 15:29:00,398,"I thought he was going to completely fall in lol.  I agree with the fly in bit. Wasn't to keen on that as you already know they're going to get tanks from Cree Lake. And the young kid is definitely annoying as hell.    That kid and a few other kids, not really kids but guys approx 24-30 have the youtube fishing thing wrapped up. They have big sponsors and have the highest sub count exceeding a million subs, not Alex specifically but another one of them. As well as their own one of baits called Googan Baits. All of those things combined generate a big revenue stream for them. As well they are involved in some way with MLF fishing.  I believe Alex and Aaron as well as Jay have started a company fishing company called Frostbite Fishing. Making ice fishing stuff, rods and lures and other things from what I understand."
1054874,AKRISONER,2020-01-12 00:40:00,5558,"Frostbite is Alex’s company. He basically replicated the googan baits business plan and did it for ice fishing. He knew that the only way it would take off is getting weibe involved so he paid him to get involved/gave him a share in the company. I’m pretty certain alex has some well to do parents that are investing in their son’s business ventures. I don’t necessarily like the guy, but I don’t think he’s a bad person he’s just somewhat annoying in videos. He is definitely a decent little businessman though. Aaron specifically was responsible for developing frostbites line of rods. youll also notice that almost every single frostbite promo YouTube video features a close up of Aaron’s face. That’s what weibe has become, anything he touches basically turns to gold. it recently came  out that frostbites hard baits are exact replicas of another company called “euro tackle” baits. Turns out China sold their mold to frostbite. it’s easy to tell what’s going on when in the most recent frostbite video Aaron basically complains that Alex is forcing him to go out fishing with him for the purpose of promoting their products. In a way you can see how pained Aaron is by what he has become. The fame has become a curse for him and you can tell he doesn’t like selling out but he’s trying to make a living. I feel somewhat bad for him."
1054884,Moosebunk,2020-01-12 14:25:00,3970,"Everything is fleeting in the world of what’s cool in the moment.  Glad to see this show back!  However they do it this time around, it’ll be a joy to watch and I'm hoping it grows even bigger. Had a chance to walk a char river, chat plenty and fish half a day with Aaron this past summer.  He is impressive. Intelligent, interesting and funny to the core.  Days later at an airport, I met Alex briefly too.  Had no idea who he was so had no bias, he seemed quite a nice fella.  So, I get home, go online and look Alex up.  And although his videos aren’t what everyone likes, (albeit he still has a HUGE following which ""he"" created) it was many people comments of him that are much sh$&ier.  He’s a kid!  He’s having fun.  He’s trying to offer that to others and find his way... and those calling him names just says more about others than him.  Calling him a “trust fund baby,” “born with a silver spoon,” “comes from rich parents” etc., that's just pure jealousy and needless stupidity right there.  As if he could help that?  Don’t like him, have class and just kindly and quietly move on. Season 2 episode 1 is great!  Pizzing about the twins on a fly-in with guides on a PRE FISH, gimme a break!  The Sask boys don’t have nearly the water to work with that the other groups do and all groups have access to incredible multi-species in their regions. You can bet once the competition starts it’ll be Sean, Adam and the cameraman in a boat. Taro is GREAT!  And Paul is a machine.  So far I like this team more this season than I did last. Both are more cohesive this round.  Looking forward to seeing the damage they can pull off on our home waters.  Big part of me hopes they win this thing. “I miss Manny!”  “I miss Manny!”  “I miss Manny!”  Over and over in the comments section.  You know what, for pure entertainment value he is the guy to miss too.  Met Manny numerous times up on Great Bear, he is a total character.  But going forward, what a wicked team it’ll be to watch, seeing lifelong buds and great anglers Aaron and Jay together.  These two share a lot of solid info, constantly!  They are the best online to follow, period! Alex and Haajaataataaaajajaa!  Great!  Didn’t mind Alex’s segments one bit, in fact, may even want to root for this underdog and see him reel in some big fish of his own.  In Manitoba it’s “ohhhh my goodness” to everything right now.  With Alex it’s “Ohhhh my gosh!  Don’t think the boys are allowed to say “Holy f*#&” or “Holy s#%&” like half the people out there we share a boat with. lol These guys are participants and producers of the most fun, entertaining and oftentimes informative videos out there.  Enjoy that they are putting this out there."

1054981,Old Ironmaker,2020-01-14 09:46:00,8243,"At this time in a wet, damp, cold, cloudy and just miserable winter with another trip south months away I could really use a Taro fix. If I had 10% of his energy I would be doing a 10K run, OK 2K. I am having trouble getting to the show. Laptop says ""site unavailable"" or some such thing when I Google it. Can someone please give me a link to Face Book or where ever I can see the new series. Loved the last one. Moosebunk, bang on post. A member of The Great Generation at the plant once told me, ""Make them come up to your level, never go down to theirs."" That was over 40 years ago and it should be plastered at the top of every social media site. By the way my God Daughter just had her second Strawberry haired baby, in a row!!. You guys may just be taking over the planet Earth soon. Bill Taylor was the man. WW2 veteran and leader of men. He lied about his age and went to Europe at 17 years young. Some 17 year olds then and now were and are afraid to leave their basements. He was famous for holding court on the Blast Furnace Cast House floors sketching diagrams in chalk on anything that was flat. R.I.P. Bill."

Just like those TV shows where people are cooking, remodelling homes, gold mining, driving 53' rigs, tow truck operators and the list is long, even now toe nail trimmers and even pimple poppers. Fun Wow!!! Thousands of movie and television stars are now homeless because of Reality TV. Oh the tragedy  of it all."

Pretty crazy stuff. The point about them not swearing, Aaron and Jay are actually very religious and christian. Jay talks about it a bit when he talks about how he met his wife. They dont like to swear or say Oh my god even! The other guys just agree to keep the videos G rated. I can assure you that Taro and Paul swear just like the rest of us lol. Cant wait for eppy 3 tonight!"
