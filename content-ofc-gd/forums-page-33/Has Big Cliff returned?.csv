As far as I know I am fine, I am not showing any symptoms at this point, my temperature is normal, and to the best of my knowledge I haven't been in contact with anyone who is infected. So far so good but I don't want to risk contact with anyone just in case. I have plenty of food, enough medications to last me 4 weeks and enough work to do around here to keep me busy for a long time. Oh and plenty of TP lol. My goal right now is to make sure I am clear then try to help as many people as I can that are dealing with this.  "
