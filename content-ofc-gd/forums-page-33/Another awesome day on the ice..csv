1057049,lickmyarmpit,2020-03-08 13:52:00,359,Fished abitibi again yesterday what an amazing fishery.  Released a ton of smalls saugers and mooneye.  Brought home a good fry for today.  Still on over 2 feet of ice and not too slushy if you stay on the trails.  
1057058,gordy28,2020-03-08 20:10:00,638,Looks like a great day Thanks for sharing Andrew

1057065,akaShag,2020-03-09 00:06:00,2073,"Are there any outfitters on that lake yet?  A few years ago, there were none.  I'd like to fish Abitibi some winter.... Doug"
1057071,lickmyarmpit,2020-03-09 03:19:00,359,There isn't alot of work from the ontario side to maintain an operation. But man that is some good fishing .
1057077,pics,2020-03-09 12:07:00,1268,It's an interesting lake for sure.  The Ontario side is wilderness while the Quebec side is farmland.  The fish are light colored due to the suspended clay particles in the water.. Google earth gives you an idea of how vast the lake is.. I'd love to fish it one day..
1057080,akaShag,2020-03-09 13:39:00,2073,"Yes that is how things were a few years back when I was looking into it. I know a couple lads from Bancroft who go there every year after the spring opener.  They set up a camp and fish for about a week, and catch a ton of walleye.  I guess the shoals are pretty interesting............"
1057084,mitch seguin,2020-03-09 14:22:00,98,I never had a machine during my 15 year stay in Timmins and was always envious of the pics and stories of the ice fishing from that lake.  Thanks for sharing the pics.
1057085,mamona,2020-03-09 14:33:00,597,"I am wondering how much longer we can do ice fishing, +11°C today..."
1057088,lickmyarmpit,2020-03-09 14:56:00,359,I've fished it from my boat in the summer but again access isn't the best and it's a really dangerous lake.  There are no markers and rocky shoals everywhere that are impossible to see until it's too late. Because the water always has very low visibility.  Definitely gonna put in some more time this soft water season and make my own charts. It really is a huge lake.  Bigger than nipissing and simcoe.  
1057097,mitch seguin,2020-03-09 20:07:00,98,"Flew over this lake a few times when I worked there and it certainly is big.  With the poor water clarity (double double on a good day) a shoal is likely to chew up your lower unit before you even see it.  I fished with my young boys at the time and while I had the proper tow vehicle and two outboards, I wasn't willing to risk a breakdown out there.  Enjoy the exploring."
