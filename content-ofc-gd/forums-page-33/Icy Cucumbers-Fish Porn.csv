1056855,David Chong,2020-02-28 21:49:00,836,"Finally got out for some Whitie action, saw quite a few on the Garmin unit and few co-operated! The ones that did bite on a Meegs(Surprise) and the NEWÂ Freedom Blade Bait! When we moved into shallow water (28FOW) for some perch, I lost a Whitefish that was probably close to double digits on a Slab Grabber. Interestingly enough and maybe we can get some feedback from other Simcoe ice anglers, every fish we caught had no fin clips so I'm assuming that they're naturals! Fought it for a long time on 4 lbs. test and of course lost her right at the hole! LOL Got to test out my NEW Striker Climate Suit and I love it, very comfortable, warm and lots of practical features plus the security of the flotation. If anyone is looking for a new Floater Suit I would definitely recommend this brand! Gonna do a video on it shortly, will post it when it's done."

1056862,cisco,2020-02-28 22:08:00,597,Nice report! When were you out there? Lack of snow hints at several days ago notÂ now after the 'big dump'. Or has it all blown away?
