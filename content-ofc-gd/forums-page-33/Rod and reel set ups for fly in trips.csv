1057015,gordy28,2020-03-06 13:50:00,638,I don't consider myself a gearhead or an expert when it comes to rods and reels But often find its one of those things that first timers tend to ask about How many do you bring?  1 piece or two piece?  Braid or mono or flourocarbon? I bring three 1 piece rods - full details are up on a new post but definitely interested in hearing others opinions?  Especially for pike set ups https://www.northernjacks.com/post/my-rod-and-reel-set-up-for-a-fly-in-fishing-trip  The pike below was caught on an ultra light set up on our first fly in Cheers 	Andrew
