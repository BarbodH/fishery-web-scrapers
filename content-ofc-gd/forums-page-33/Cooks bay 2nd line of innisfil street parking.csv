1056342,huzzsaba,2020-02-13 07:10:00,884,"Anyone have any info on where to park there? Is it ok to park all along 2nd line. According to google street view, there are no no parking signs along the north side of 2nd line and none that I can see on Dempsey rd either. Im asking because we are approximately a group 12 cars and dont mind walking a bit as long as parking is allowed along those streets. Thanks"
1056344,Chuck Enwinde,2020-02-13 10:49:00,247,Parking spots have almost become like fishing spots - but not quite.Â  PM inbound.

1056366,BillM,2020-02-13 18:55:00,17367,12 cars?Â  Use the car pool lot and get that down to 3-4.

1056390,Headhunter,2020-02-14 13:42:00,5703,It's my understanding that folks are parking on the ice off of Keswick. Why pay or worry? HH
1056817,maker a laker,2020-02-27 19:27:00,33,"Simcoe ice off Keswick was 16-18 inches thick this past Saturday. Rayners road launch had 20-30 cars parked on the ice beside the peer. A bit of a hump at the end of the ramp, but ice wasÂ  rough with thin snow for decent traction. Walked out about 1km, saw another 30-40 vehicles on the ice. Side by Sides, Corollas, Civics, Jeeps, SUVs of all kinds. No pressure cracks off the peer like last year to stop people.Â No snow drifts to bog you down, so lots of cars all over the place."
1056818,misfish,2020-02-27 19:45:00,29133,That will not be the case after today. Lots of wind and snow here. Will hide all those danger spots.
1056846,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-28 19:19:00,8243,"12 cars! How many fishermen? Rent a couple of those 12 person vans for the day. With fuel for that convoy with parking costs and problems it might be less to rent 2 vans, if that's enough. 12 cars, Wowza."
1056849,Terry,2020-02-28 20:02:00,14456,"You would need an extraÂ van or two just for all the icefishing stuff , chairs , augersÂ and floater suits"

1056858,irishfield,2020-02-28 21:56:00,26272,"Maybe, but it would take two extras for Paul's!"
1056861,OhioFisherman,2020-02-28 22:04:00,6623,Maybe a charter bus to parking?
1056874,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-29 18:11:00,8243,"Not sure where Huzz lives, T.O. I think. 30 bucks in gas for 12 cars $360.00. Probably more like 50. $600.00. Yep charter a bus. Maybe 2 if Brian tags along."
1056878,misfish,2020-02-29 18:55:00,29133,"I live here.  The furthest I would have to travel is, 20 min away. Closest is 5 min away . The babyÂ  Ram ,carry's everything I need."
