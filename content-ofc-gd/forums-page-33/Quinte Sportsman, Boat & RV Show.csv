If so please drop by the ""EVERYTHING you wanted to know about FISHING but were afraid 2 ask..."" exhibit which will be located right at the main entrance! Check out this new educational showcase, would love your feedback and in return, if you mention this board, I'll give you a nice prize! There will also be some great FREE seminars to catch as well while you're there! Hope to see you all there!  "
