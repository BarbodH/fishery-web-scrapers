1057073,Out4Trout,2020-03-09 04:22:00,98,"This fella strolled past my trailcam, 2 weeks ago, in our woodlot. We live in a remote area, have seen a few black bears, lots of coyotes but this is the first cat on the trailcam.    "
1057075,Sandbag,2020-03-09 10:41:00,533,That's very cool.  Pretty elusive creatures.  Cheers  Craig
1057076,lew,2020-03-09 11:29:00,12766,Great catch of a beautiful rare animal for sure !! 
1057086,mamona,2020-03-09 14:35:00,597,Interesting... Any reason for the cat to be there?
1057096,SirCranksalot,2020-03-09 20:05:00,3291,.............but is Bob yer uncle?? 
1057110,DRIFTER_016,2020-03-09 22:53:00,10439,Saw one in December on my way South. First time I saw one was when ice fishing South East of Yellowknife. Saw a family group of 6 on the lake a few hundred yards from where I was fishing.
1057111,John Bacon,2020-03-09 23:16:00,3277,It's a remote area in the bush.  I can't think of a reason for it not to there. 
1057114,tomO,2020-03-10 00:05:00,363,Quite a lot of them around southeast Ohio.
1057115,Weeds,2020-03-10 00:13:00,782,Is that a bobcat or a lynx? Never been fortunate enough to see either and I wouldn’t know the difference if I did. Very cool though.
1057116,Out4Trout,2020-03-10 00:20:00,98,"Yes, they mate late January into early February. 60 day gestation, born in late March early April) Not often they are out in the daytime, but a higher probability during mating season. (She can't get any sleep)"
1057117,Out4Trout,2020-03-10 00:21:00,98,"Bobcat. Lynx have bigger feet, longer back legs than front, and ear tufts are longer. Lynx and bobcat ranges do overlap Sault through and around Superior, but not in this area."
1057118,Out4Trout,2020-03-10 00:23:00,98,Cool. I think up in NWT and Yukon it is exclusively Lynx range... close cousins of the Bobcat
1057119,Out4Trout,2020-03-10 00:25:00,98,Makes sense - some mountainous/rough country toward WVa. They are as far south as New Mexico apparently
1057123,DRIFTER_016,2020-03-10 01:06:00,10439,"Yep, just lynx up here."
1057132,LeXXington,2020-03-10 14:00:00,1928,cool picture
