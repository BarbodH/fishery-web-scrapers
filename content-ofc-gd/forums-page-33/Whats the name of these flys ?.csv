1057692,misfish,2020-03-21 16:25:00,29133,"They look like a large nymph , but can not seem to find them on line .  Staying busy in side .  "
1057693,Moosebunk,2020-03-21 16:28:00,3970,Those are bead and conehead Whooly Buggers bud.
1057695,misfish,2020-03-21 16:48:00,29133,"Wait, I forgot the pics of the fly I am looking for."
1057696,misfish,2020-03-21 16:52:00,29133,These ones    I just finished tying those woolys Drew.  
1057707,Gil Levesque,2020-03-21 23:20:00,103,Those are stonefly nymphs!here are some ive tied! I found them tedious especially the legs! 
1057708,misfish,2020-03-21 23:33:00,29133,"Thanks Gil  I thought they were some nymph ,but never seen them with the legs like that."
1057717,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-22 03:58:00,8243,Dat dem der are Briflies.
1057756,misfish,2020-03-22 21:48:00,29133,Went with what I had. They work  
1057787,Tom S,2020-03-23 14:11:00,362,"I like Skip Morris' version, adds a bit of hackle to give the illusion of legs and movement. http://www.skip-morris-fly-tying.com/hackled-skip-nymph.html Those look real nice Gil. Did you use lacquered turkey feathers for the wing cases?   "
1057797,misfish,2020-03-23 15:42:00,29133,"I knew mine were ugly. Nice ties . When I slow down,I can do better work, I just screwed around with what I had . Some of the ones I watched on you tube were crazy long to tie. I am not that dedicated yet, but when life slows down, I am sure I will .  For the life of me though, I can not get that dub to go tight on the thread . Thats why I prefer CDC feathers . Will even bulk up with peacock heral ."
1057814,misfish,2020-03-23 20:19:00,29133,Watched a good video at break time today . I know now how to put those top wings on . Stopped by Cabelas after work but they were lined up outside. 10 people at a time . All it takes is 10 people walking around for 1/2 hour and wait to go in. PASS.
1057820,RayK,2020-03-23 21:03:00,25,"The Stonefly is my goto Steelhead fly, with an Egg Fly dropper below it. Here’s a picture of a stonefly from 2 weeks ago on the snow next to the river bank."
1057825,misfish,2020-03-23 21:15:00,29133,WOW thank you for the pic Ray.
1057848,Tom S,2020-03-24 01:08:00,362,Less is more with dubbing. If you apply it to thickly it won't twist properly on the thread and won't sit nice on the fly. Try using half of what you're using right now.
1057874,Gil Levesque,2020-03-24 12:31:00,103,"Tom, on my first small ones i used short wide pieces of biot! Pita!!! Then i used turkey feathers painted with Fabric Fusion! Stays flexible when dry and easy to cut to shape! I also tried pieces of old VHS tape. Kinda worked! Experiment!! Cheers! And thanx for the compliment!"
