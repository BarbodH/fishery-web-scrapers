1056240,AKRISONER,2020-02-10 14:00:00,5558,"for how friggin big moose are, they may be some of the dumbest animals out there. They literally act and move around like a 2 year old stuck in andre the giants body lol. My dad had one decide to fight his car in Alberta."

1056254,lew,2020-02-11 13:26:00,12766,"She actually followed me, I saw her a couple hundred feet earlier and snapped this 2nd picture then I walked away and she went thru the trees and came out again and when I took the 1st picture she was only 50' away. Just a big ole friendly girlÂ  LOL "
1056960,Out4Trout,2020-03-03 16:08:00,98,Hilarious but glad they didn't get stomped
1056965,DRIFTER_016,2020-03-03 21:44:00,10439,I don't trust those things at all. Bears are more predictable than moose. One year I was sitting on some access stairs into the Russian River in Alaska when a 2 year old moose came up the river. It walked into the pool in front of me took a drink and then approached me. As I didn't want to get my butt kicked I stood up and backed away. Turns out he was just curious as he seemed to shrug his shoulders and turn back out into the river. He was only a few feet away when he turned.
