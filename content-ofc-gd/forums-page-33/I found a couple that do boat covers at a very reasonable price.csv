1057283,Old Ironmaker,2020-03-14 03:39:00,8243,I am getting a new Sunbrella travel cover done for my StarCraft Superfisherman 190 next week for $750.00. That is a very fair price after pricing one for a few years. If anyone is interested in getting a new cover PM me and I will give you their number. They are in Dunnville. I have nothing to do with their business other than as a customer. I have seen the work they do and was impressed. Johnny D
1057297,Spiel,2020-03-14 13:53:00,9065,They did my cover. 
1057850,pikehunter,2020-03-24 01:24:00,1659,"Likely the same people made the cover for my new boat back in 2005 when I bought a complete package from Riverside Marine in Dunnville. Did a great job of it, good price and it was made from Topgun material. I no longer have the boat ☹️"
1057855,Fish Farmer,2020-03-24 02:02:00,2234,That couple are members of our fishing club. They made a travel cover for my boat and a awning for my deck on the back of my house. 10X16
1057864,pikehunter,2020-03-24 08:52:00,1659,Nice size awning Dave.  Is it fixed or can you roll it up?
1057877,Fish Farmer,2020-03-24 13:07:00,2234,Yes it rolled up right now over winter soon to be put up. 
1057902,pikehunter,2020-03-24 20:41:00,1659,Quite the frame. Should do a good job of holdIng the awning together in the wind.
