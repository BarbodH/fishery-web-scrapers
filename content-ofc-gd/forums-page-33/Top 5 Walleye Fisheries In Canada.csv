1056917,OhioFisherman,2020-03-02 14:23:00,6623,"LOL, what did you win for those 3 fish? http://www.lakeeriefishingderby.com/2020-fall-brawl.html?fbclid=IwAR3_Iz-4XBbSWbXbkao3jb-cdIdkldqrKzd6esYCNswH76lIk3QN_7ostUE Actually winning that thing involves a good deal of luck, same could be said of a lot of fishing events though. We don't really have a Quinte here, so choice areas and spots can cover a lot of miles. In part you are competing against charter captains that operate as head boats during the brawl, they only want fall brawl participants. https://www.facebook.com/groups/301921010176028/ It is quite a distance to come for a lot of people, planning for someone not from the area can be very tough, because you are having to gamble on the weather also, some days you just aren't getting out to fish."
1056929,FILTHY OAR,2020-03-02 20:26:00,65,20lb Walleye ?Â  by the way no one targets walleye on Simcoe anymore.
1056930,Terry,2020-03-02 20:36:00,14456,People do target walleye on simcoe not as much as when we could fish for them till April. Â Ice fishing for them when the mouth of Talbot starts to open great shore fishing. But not season closes midlife March so timing sucks walleye opener has some real good shallow water trolling for them. And summer time night fishing could get you some great walleye my largest was 13.5. I was fishing from shore and that night I was a guy coming off the ice dragging a 15.5 and a 18.5. Â I canâ€™t believe he killed them. Sure they tasted like wood. I just snapped a photo took a weight Â and released them Â  But yeah people still target them
1056931,FILTHY OAR,2020-03-02 20:49:00,65,"Interesting, thought it was more of an incidential catch thingÂ then actually targeting them."
1057089,pics,2020-03-09 15:15:00,1268,I guess because it's a national magazine they have to include areas from across the country.Â  I would think NW ON has some of the best in the world..
1057092,misfish,2020-03-09 18:30:00,29133,Little lake in Barrie . Nuff said .

1056715,captpierre,2020-02-25 02:16:00,2521,Cool but how does Erie not make the list ðŸ˜³
1056716,Moosebunk,2020-02-25 03:24:00,3970,It's an advertisement really...
1056723,Garnet,2020-02-25 14:05:00,2056,Erie is just becoming general knowledge for the 3 rd time in my life.
1056724,Tjames09,2020-02-25 14:44:00,664,"theyÂ wereÂ the top 5, not anymore lol."
1056731,Jmeyer,2020-02-25 20:30:00,83,"Like bunk said it's just advertisements, it's the top 5 walleye lakes fishin canada has done a promo on this season. Theres so many great walleye destinations I'd hate to pick 5 and defend it."
1056784,captpierre,2020-02-26 22:18:00,2521,I read the Erie lake wide allowable catch limit in 2019 was 8.5 million walleye. ðŸ˜³ Â  Â Between sport and commercial fishing. Thatâ€™s a pile of eyes Iâ€™ll have to tap into some day.....says this Erie walleye virgin. Â ðŸ˜Ž 
1056788,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-26 23:45:00,8243,"Exactly captainpierre. Many polls have Erie as #1 in the world.Â  Bay of Quinte, yes. I've never fished for Pics west but there are thousands of Walleye factories in Ontario. They should take their Ontario Outdoors Cards from these 2 imposters. Blasphemy I say, blasphemy. "
1056789,captpierre,2020-02-26 23:54:00,2521,"Just did some math. At a 4 lb average thatâ€™s 17,000 tons of walleye harvestable ðŸ˜²"
1056791,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-27 01:02:00,8243,"I've seen the commercial boats come in at Port Dover just packed full of big Pickerel and Perch. Sad in many ways but those guys need to make a living too, I get that. No commercial fishing on the US side of Erie for many years now. I don't know about the other Great Lakes we share a border with."
1056792,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-27 01:06:00,8243,"If you ever get this way Capt. I will gladly have you out as my 1st mate. I have to warn you long lining is the most boring fishing I have ever done. It makes up for it when you have a 9 pounder on the end of your line as long as it doesn't turn out to be a farm animal, code words for Sheepshead. I hate them critters that impersonate a Pic."
1056797,captpierre,2020-02-27 01:57:00,2521,Thanks. I might take you up on that. Â  When theyâ€™re on I hear itâ€™s pretty easy to fill a cooler.
1056801,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-27 03:50:00,8243,You are welcome anytime. When they are on 3 fish will fill a big cooler!!!!!! We have had 6 fish coming in at 40 lbs. Actually sizes were down last year but everyone was limiting out. 1st time I have ever heard in the over 35 years fishing for them on Erie fishermen were culling limits.
1056834,Yellow Fever,2020-02-28 11:53:00,139,"Erie has numbers but Quinte has bigger fish, and i fish both places."
1056837,OhioFisherman,2020-02-28 13:53:00,6623,"How many auto workers, steel workers, and others in the manufacturing industry had to find other lines of work? It's sad that basically a few can spoil the fishing for many? I can still recall the battles here over buying out the commercial walleye netters, and their arguments that they weren't taking enough fish to hurt the population, but once they were gone from our waters here the walleye fishing on Erie returned. Sure there are other factor, weather, the spawn, but the biggest problem seemed to be the netters?"
1056841,Walltrout,2020-02-28 16:46:00,18,"Erie is a world class walleye, smallmouth and perch fishery. All other lakes are a distant second."
1056845,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-28 19:11:00,8243,"I don't disagree Paul, this has been aÂ  discussion that has taken place over a beer at the local watering holes for decades. I don't know the answer, if I did I would be in Parliament or Queens Park. The commercial guys argument is they do not harm the sport fishery and they bring in millions in revenue into our country fromÂ  overseas sales. Japan being their prime market."
1056851,David Chong,2020-02-28 21:20:00,836,My thoughts exactly!
1056871,limeyangler,2020-02-29 02:31:00,5204,Nothing in NW Ontario? Really? Lol.
1056875,Old Ironmaker,2020-02-29 18:21:00,8243,"I agree BOQ has bigger as in fatter fish, through the ice. We fished Big Island for years evert spring and the sizes averaged 2.5 pounds. Any day on Erie theÂ  average size is 5 lbs. Probably more. This past year however sizes were down but the # of fish caught everyday even by newbies were ridiculous."
1056877,lew,2020-02-29 18:46:00,12766,"That brings back a flood of memories John, every May 24 long weekend for most of my life Quinte was our annual springtime family fishing trip around Hay Bay. My dad, myself & my brother along with uncles, cousins, grandfather and friends. Kept it up for years but one by one they all started dying off until it was just my brother and I left and then he passed in 2007 and now I'm the only one left and that was it for the fishing trip....done. Still got a lifetime of great memories left though"
1056879,OhioFisherman,2020-02-29 20:17:00,6623,As the season progresses and gets nearer to the spawn those fish fatten up and eggs fully develop.
1056891,ehg,2020-03-01 03:34:00,2666,"TheyÂ  forgot to mention Simcoe. Saw lots of 20 lb fish when you could fish Talbot river by Gamebridge 30yrs ago. MyÂ  largestÂ thru ice was there. Wisely they put season back a couple weeks, Fished Quinte as well. Simcoe fish were bigger thru ice way back when you could fish late March."
1056904,dave524,2020-03-02 02:12:00,4508,"They forgot to mention the Moon River Basin, back in the 70's a guy I worked with, won the old Molson's Big Fish Contest with one at 17 and change.Â  Lot of big ones in the top ten from the Moon River back then."
1056912,Yellow Fever,2020-03-02 11:48:00,139,"I wasn't really taking the hard water fishery in to consideration, Quinte fall fish probably have the largest average. We never really get small fish. I have a buddy that wants me to go down and fish the Fall Brawl but in one day last fall i had 3 fish that would have topped the top 6 in the Brawl. Nobody even turns a head at a 10lb walleye"
