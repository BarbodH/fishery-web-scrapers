1057337,LefroyFisherman,2020-03-15 13:24:00,602,"I was wondering if anyone has seen the Perch Color In-Line spinners number 5 from blue fox. I had one for years and years that was amazing for pike, lent it to a buddy last fall and he proceeded to lose it fishing. I've been trying to find it ever since, I can find the smaller ones but not with the number 5 blades."
1057338,OhioFisherman,2020-03-15 14:53:00,6623,"I used Mepps or Rooster Tail for in line spinners, do you mean these?  https://www.thornebros.com/products/blue-fox-vibrax-chaser?variant=28695735894090"
1057352,LefroyFisherman,2020-03-15 18:46:00,602,"No, I use the Meeps Giant killer ones all the time with great success, but the Blue Fox brand worked really well also in 10-15 feet of water."
1057354,Kawartha Kev,2020-03-15 19:49:00,281,"Not sure which ""perch in line spinner"" you are talking about do you mean the fire tiger pattern perhaps check out Ebay here https://www.ebay.com/b/Blue-Fox-Perch-Fishing-Spinners/1493/bn_7215254 Kawartha Kev"
1057355,LefroyFisherman,2020-03-15 19:53:00,602,I meant perch colour blade
1057356,Kawartha Kev,2020-03-15 20:01:00,281,Hmm not sure I have seen that version I use a lot of the super vibrax musky baits in the large silver blade with black 
1057358,LefroyFisherman,2020-03-15 20:05:00,602,There found a picture of it I took before I gave it to the guy lol! It was a number 6 
1057359,Kawartha Kev,2020-03-15 20:08:00,281,I do have #6 blade with a kind of perch pattern on it with a gold color to the center part of the lure and a multi colored bucktail of yellow black and red perhaps the version you are talking about if you are talking pike/musky size lures Kawartha Kev 
1057360,Kawartha Kev,2020-03-15 20:08:00,281,Yup thats it I have one. Nothing left of your buck tail LOL!! Can't remember where or when I got it probably at one of the fishing or Sportmens shows some years ago.  
1057365,LefroyFisherman,2020-03-15 20:32:00,602,"It was pretty old, but would always catch fish! especially up near Norland. Simcoe I use mostly the giant killer meeps. Canadian tire has the same ones but only up to number 4."
1057366,Kawartha Kev,2020-03-15 20:44:00,281,I found this site online that carry's them including the perch version called Johnnyspond  if you want to try an online site http://www.johnnyspond.com/blue-fox-vibrax-musky-buck-lures.html Good luck Kawartha Kev They are from the US so might be pretty pricey with shipping
1057367,LefroyFisherman,2020-03-15 20:47:00,602,"Nice, Thanks "
1057492,Fang,2020-03-18 16:44:00,1330,"start with a gold on gold version and go to Deserres art store for permanent waterproof markers. They usually run about $3-4 each I have a bunch from there to recolor spoons, body baits and such. works well"
