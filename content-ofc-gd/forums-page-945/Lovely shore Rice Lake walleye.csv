264608,Steelcat,2008-11-04 16:59:00,191,"The weather was extremely calm yesterday night.  With this condition, it should be bad for walleye night shore fishing.  Nature is unpredictable and here's the results. The biggest of the night  Biggest vs smallest (13.5 inches)  Another big eye around 7 lbs  Shore big eye on jig/grub  A semi weird looking 19.5 inches eye  Yet another 6-7 lbs  All the mama/papa walleyes were released   Overall we caught 7 eyes from 13.5 inches to 28+ inches Never give up, just keep casting~!"
