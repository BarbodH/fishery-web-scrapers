264296,highdrifter,2008-11-03 15:06:00,2534,"Hey gang,  Played hooky on Friday and linked up with BC and Chris for a little trouting out East..  The conditions were tough, but we managed a few solid fish.  Weather wise, the day was absolutely gorgeous,  no doubt the last one in the high teens.  The fish stopped bitting when the sun became too intense, so we just chilled, soaked up the rays and enjoyed a couple larfs..  We're still learning the craft, and we gain a little more knowledge every time we hit the water.  This day was no exception.  Glass floats, ultra light fluro tipets, small hooks and small roe bags were an absolute must.  All fish were gleaming silver, fresh from the lake after the rains, and they all fought like they had roid rage!!  Here's some pics.  Enjoy.     Silver so intense, the glare makes you squint.     This buck went absolutely gonzo!     and the close-up.     This toad didn't mind sharing his hole.  He struck a pose for the shot.     You gotta love it!!     Billy..     Chris..     And moi..     Thanks for reading.  H to the D"

264391,highdrifter,2008-11-03 22:20:00,2534,"Awwww Snaglepuss..  The smell of skunk must permeate your work trousers lately..  Don't worry, I'm privy to a spot with mountains of beer cans.  I'll take you to it on Wednesday.  You can pick up cans while I work my crankbaits..  HD"
264398,WeedLine,2008-11-03 22:51:00,322,That fish is a female
264403,Spiel,2008-11-03 23:02:00,9065,....Good stuff guys. I'm still trying to find time to throw a line for steelies this fall.

264407,Greencoachdog,2008-11-03 23:16:00,8163,"Excellent report, pics, and fish Bubba!!!  Glad you could tear ""Wild Man"" Billy away from his ""metal"" mandolin for an outing!!!  Hosers!"
264411,highdrifter,2008-11-03 23:27:00,2534," Don't worry..  We rock it out whenever, wherever.  In fact, Chris and billy had a gig the night before if I remember.  They're called The White Squirrel Sinners..  Hey that's right up your alley dawg!  HD"
264412,Greencoachdog,2008-11-03 23:32:00,8163, I'm more of a Gray Squirrel Sinner nowadays!
264414,Greencoachdog,2008-11-03 23:38:00,8163,  He has become quite the critical one as of late eh?  Do you reckon he has been having to perform self Snagellation on his Snagella?  Perk up Bubba!... Ice out Poike are only 6 months away!!!
264418,Joey,2008-11-03 23:52:00,9122,"Gorgeous Fish there Fidel.  Looks like you guys had a nice, relaxing time  Joey"
264420,highdrifter,2008-11-03 23:54:00,2534, I reckon dawg..  That's what happens with self snagellation..  The baitcaster hand gets all cramped up and  focus is severely disrupted with all that snagelling..    So it's official.  I guess Grant is a hoser too!  
264421,highdrifter,2008-11-04 00:02:00,2534," Ah thanks darling..  We do make teamsters look like work horses..  Can't wait to do some more ""relaxing"" with you and Paul next year!!  Don't worry Glen..  We got you mang.  yyee yyeeeeeee HD"
264438,StoneFly,2008-11-04 00:52:00,574,"Nice Work Bud,...some fresh lookin chromers there.  You mentioned the last one to be in the high teens,..you should definately make a point of getting a pic of a fish that big with some reference.  Im not sayin I dont beleive you, but 'high teens' is a pic for showin off, sometimes the chrome of the season or maybe a lifetime.....ya know.  Cheers!!!"
264440,Greencoachdog,2008-11-04 00:58:00,8163,  He was talkin' about the outside temperature.
264441,chickenhawk,2008-11-04 01:00:00,612,weedline is right that fish is a hen....im not saying that becuz i think im a know it all either......so need to take offence to it....   Hawk
