263992,DMASSE,2008-11-02 15:15:00,420,Hello  A friend asked me when the lakes and rivers close in the Kawartha's  He was asking about Cameron and Balsam.  Can anyone tell me  any help would be appreciated  Dave
263994,Raf,2008-11-02 15:19:00,3495,http://mnr.gov.on.ca  nov 15th i believe
264021,GBW,2008-11-02 19:33:00,8460,correct
264108,Rizzo,2008-11-03 00:23:00,4754,"there are no fish in Balsam, tell them to try somewhere else  :angel:"
264227,e-z-out,2008-11-03 12:30:00,1052,  Only sunfish in Balsam  Yes the 15th is the closing date for the Kawartha's
264244,Billy Bob,2008-11-03 13:15:00,5865,WHY do they close down fishing in Kawarthas at all.
264291,irishfield,2008-11-03 14:55:00,26272, Because we've learned to preserve and conserve in Ontario!
264395,Billy Bob,2008-11-03 22:41:00,5865," But  this only applies to the Kawarthas and if you REALLY want to conserve then outlaw gill nets in Ontario waters of Lake Erie like we have done in NY, Pa and Ohio...."
