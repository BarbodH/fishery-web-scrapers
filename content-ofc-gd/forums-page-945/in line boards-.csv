But, we know nothing about planar boards (not much about walleye either ).  I think from the posts here we should be able to hook a few.....so planar boards.  We have planar boards that the main line slides through.  http://www.swboards.com/ (not trying to spam here) Are these good enough?  forrest"
264424,Terry,2008-11-04 00:18:00,14456,that don't look like any planer board I have ever seen / used
264435,PERCHER,2008-11-04 00:37:00,787,Try either one of these .Different strokes for different folks I personally prefer the second ones.These links should give almost all that you will need for Quinte Walleye.

264436,Fisherman,2008-11-04 00:48:00,7201,Where did you get them?
264443,forrest,2008-11-04 01:01:00,1032, A friend of a friend ordered them online (see weblink) and I blindly said I was in too.  Not saying that they are good or bad.....just don't know much about them.  forrest
264588,Headhunter,2008-11-04 13:53:00,5703,Those are new to me as well! I would assume that they will work like any other in-line board... watch yer graph and put yer lures in front of the fish and you should be golden! HH
