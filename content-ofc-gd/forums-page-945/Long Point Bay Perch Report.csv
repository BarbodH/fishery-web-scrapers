From 10 - 2 we never caught a fish besides a couple sunfish, moved around and finally found a little crater that was full of decent perch. Managed 25 in the pail at an average of 10 inches a piece. Only 6 throwback dinks and big fish of the day was 14 inches. Fish hit from about 2 til 5PM.  Almost all of them were caught on minnows but a few fell to worms when we ran out of minnows.  No more perch for me now til ice up. Bigger things on the agenda!"

264465,Greencoachdog,2008-11-04 01:35:00,8163,  Seafood dinner $7.95! = poor fisherman!
264496,Clampet,2008-11-04 02:48:00,1947," It was $9.95 fer the perch Dinner, but I added a Walleye fillet fer an extra $4.95."
