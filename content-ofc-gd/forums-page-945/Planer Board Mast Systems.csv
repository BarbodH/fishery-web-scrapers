264528,irishfield,2008-11-04 04:21:00,26272,Is how I did it when I had my Glastron... machined my own adapter and I still have it available for sale. Unfortunately mine was a solid insert that went in my seat post hole.. not like that one you have.   
264540,rhare,2008-11-04 05:04:00,387,Im pretty sure Big Jon sells the mast system your looking for.
264553,Billy Bob,2008-11-04 12:04:00,5865,I have  Cannon Mast that is in EXCELLENT shape I am willing to sell and I have boards for sale. The Cannon mast just like the Cannon downriggers are a cut above ANY others. They have a clutch system built into the reels so the handle does not spin while deploying the boards.  Bob
