Checking on our Lower Grand River fishery...Thank you to her for all her work.      It was a great day had by all...Thanks for coming out and participating in our 5th Annual Lower Grand Walleye Tournament.  Sorry about the lack of fish pictures, as fast as we could Weigh, scan and measure these fish it was a live release tournament so we didn't have a lot of time before needing to get these guys into the holding tank for release when all information was taken.  Steve and Jen"
264015,grt1,2008-11-02 19:02:00,638,"A couple of questions for you,  what kind of bait do you allow, live or artificial? What is that yellow thing with a circle in the last picture?  Growing up and learning to fish on the Grand River keeps me interested in what is happening down there.  Sometimes I wish I could have had a chance to fish further down the river than just the Brantford area."
264017,jjcanoe,2008-11-02 19:13:00,744,"yellow thing is a reader to check for electronic tags in the walleye, similar to the type a vet would use if you had a dog or ca with a microchip for ID  jjcanoe"
264020,lew,2008-11-02 19:24:00,12767,Thanks for the update Steve and good to see Bosc is still placing in the money as always.
264043,jwl,2008-11-02 21:46:00,1056,"great going on the day Steve, nice to see some good fish brought in.  pretty cool to see that the MNR came down with the PIT tag reader..that's a great idea, I wonder if we can get any feed-back to see if it's any of the fish I helped catch and tag over the last couple years...curious where any of the fish tagged that you know of???"
264049,Fishmaster,2008-11-02 22:35:00,920,All fish that we had for the tourney were taged 3 years ago no Pit Tags were found in any of the fish weighed in Saturday ...funny how you get diffrent schools of fish from year to year ...looks like its going to be another awesome winter ice fishing again ...

264357,jwl,2008-11-03 19:36:00,1056," right on Steve, thanks for filling me in,  I was curious to see, it's awesome to see the fishery there is so diverse, and I look forward to helping the MNR again in the spring.   One of the ""recaps"" we got before was from 2000, it is great to see all the different year classes of fish that come into there"
