264529,Wendel,2008-11-04 04:24:00,213,Was down at the Thames this weekend. This is my biggest musky I've yet to land. I all my excitement the fish was rather stressed so I let it go rather quickly without a measure. Any photoshop wizards that can guestimate the size of this one? I'm a pretty big guy.  I measured my shoulders at 24 inches across. My calcs have it around 47 or 48inches.  Let me know what you think.  
264531,irishfield,2008-11-04 04:31:00,26272,"Nice fish Wendal!! Length is hard in a pic. Even the same fish from different angles and holds changes the length preception immensely.  This one was exactly 48"" without a tail pinch.  "
264532,Wendel,2008-11-04 04:38:00,213,"Tell me about it... not a world record fish or anything, just a PB for me. Here is the release shot it did have some shoulders  "
264534,irishfield,2008-11-04 04:42:00,26272,"Looks a lot thicker there... just figured we have our arms about the same positon in each picture. My shoulders are about 22"". From that you can probably get a ratio to come close.  ..quick calcs from measuring the pictures has your fish at about 46"" but that could be off an inch or two for sure."
264536,Wendel,2008-11-04 04:47:00,213,46 works for me to!  It was a real brute coming in.
264549,Rich,2008-11-04 11:03:00,3927,"No matter what the exact length, it's a beauty! Congrats!"
264559,Greencoachdog,2008-11-04 12:30:00,8163,"Congrats on your PB Musky!!!  That is a very nice fish and I'd go along with the 48"" guesstimate!"
264561,lew,2008-11-04 12:47:00,12767,"Congrats on the PB musky Wendel !!    46, 47, 48 ??....... it doesn't really matter anyways does it ??....... it's a beaut no matter what size it is and good on you for being concerned with her time outta water rather than worrying about how big she was.  To me that's a sign of a real sportsman  I've never really understood anyways why some fishermen are so concerned about weighing,  measuring and photographing every fish they catch, no matter how small.  Again, congrats to you Wendel !!"
264565,silveradosheriff,2008-11-04 13:08:00,1025,46.625 :-)  Nice Fish!!!
264580,ccmtcanada,2008-11-04 13:41:00,7971,Beauty fish....and congrats on the PB!  Regardless of the size it's a great looking fish!!!!
264582,snag,2008-11-04 13:43:00,1932,What Mr.PB above said!  Congrats!
264600,Rizzo,2008-11-04 15:22:00,4754,"all I can see is a little red X, but sounds like everyone else is seeing a nice musky. I'd guesstimate the X at around 5 millimetres"
264619,fishnsled,2008-11-04 17:54:00,3520,Sweet looking fish.  Congrats on the PB!
264772,Wendel,2008-11-05 04:21:00,213," Thanks for the words Lew, I usually don't even measure musky, when I'm on the river I cringe at some of the guys that have every dude on the boat pose with the fish. As big and powerful as a musky is, it's probably the wimpiest fish in the lake, they are really fragile and you need to get them back in the water asap!"
264778,Wild,2008-11-05 04:37:00,704,"It's also important to have the proper landing equipment of proper size to prevent permanent damage to the Muskie, I hate to see fin splits!  Nice catch Wendel!"
264791,SNAGKING,2008-11-05 05:27:00,43,Nice musky!
264805,outllaw,2008-11-05 12:02:00,1232,great stuff wendel. putting the fish before the familiar photo ops. thinking like that will insure a future for every musky fisherman... i wish there were more like you. whether its a 50lber or a baby spottie they are all treasures.
