Managed 2 steelhead and 2 browns, one of which was an absolute slab of a male brown in the 15lb range. Landed the beast and another angler took a photo which mysteriously didn't appear on my camera  . I'm guessing he inadvertantly turned the camera off  .  Also missed a nice shot of a 7lb bow when it slipped out of my hands and back in the water..  I did get shots of the other two       Not bad for a morning of hacking around!"
