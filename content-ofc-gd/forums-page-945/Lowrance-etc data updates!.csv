Didn't think much of it the last time I saw it.. but this time I went out and checked my 112C and it was only on Version 1.8 (and I've had some issues with it)... Freeeeee update available for Version 2.4 There is also a beta only on Version 2.4.2.... to stop digital depth flashing (which I have a problem with some times) but gonna let them finish that one first before I try it.  I downloaded to an SD card - 15 seconds.. went out and put the card in the Lowrance and it auto updates itself as soon as you turn it on. It added a few features it appears... one (at least that I never noticed before) is the ability to select shallow water / deep water / slow troll / fast troll / general fishing / clear water / fresh water / sea water.  Looks like I now have to reset all my settings again though.  Will see if it makes any difference tomorrow hunting 'skis.  Not sure whom else has a 112C.... but I know Squid does. Peter.. do you have a reader to download it yourself, or do you want me to send you the card via mail ? ( and you can pass it on to the next guy or send it back to me)  Wayne  Link for downloads of all models  http://www.lowrance.com/en/Downloads/Produ...ftware-Updates/"

263872,Rich Clemens,2008-11-01 22:41:00,3131,I check their site periodically for updates for my H2O and LCX 28C HD units.   Have installed a few updates over the years.

Of course forgot to get an updated manual so now I am forced to learn it the old fashioned way. Thank god I never forget a spot..... just dont let my wife know that or she will nag....why do you need one!!!"
264152,irishfield,2008-11-03 02:09:00,26272,"What a difference on the screen data after this software update. Incredibly clearer fish marking and ""hooks"" that I didn't get before.  If you're unit is behind on software versions don't delay in updating !"
264568,RandyLinden,2008-11-04 13:13:00,40,Bucktail You can download Lowrance Manuals from their site as well. There are even updates available for manuals.  Here is the link:  http://www.lowrance.com/en/Downloads/Manuals/
