264962,Daplumma,2008-11-05 23:27:00,1961,I will congradulate Obama on running a great campaign.Not who I voted for but the country has spoken.Yes Rick you were correct but I sorta thought he would win also.I would like to have someone who has a bit more expierience and been vetted more thoroughly and not given a pass by the liberal press here.Bad news for me and other entrepreneurs in this country but it is important we give him a chance to work out his policies.The market was down quite a bit today.

264963,JohnF,2008-11-05 23:29:00,3494," Perhaps the lack of Canuck voter involvement is as much a result of sub-par political candidates and grey and greyer party lines as mere voter apathy. How many flavours of vanilla ice cream can one countenance before losing interest? Perhaps we Canucks are just becoming innured to having little to choose from and need someone to step up and offer a change, even if it's only putting the first woman or the first black man in the first office, or offering a change from the usual lies and political hackery. Hell, if some of our candidates up here in the frozen north would even be credible liars they might get my attention, but choosing between Dark Grey and Charcoal is pretty durned pedestrian. It's time we Canucks reared up on our hind legs and demanded a viable alternative from a political party. The ones we've got have lost their allure. We're mired in shades of boredom and chicanery, and the chicanery is of a low order. If the Green Party could only overcome their innate sense of typical Canuck insecurity and show some cojones they could probably garner loads of votes, if only as an attractive if unknown alternative, but they're too timid to step out of their ""we're not quite as obtrusive as those Green Peace freaks, but we'd like to see some change that doesn't offend anyone"" mode. Who says we have to subscribe to the liberal/conservative paradigm any longer? All we need is a viable, and ballsy, alternative.  Oops. I just fell off my soapbox. Gonna go now and wash away the bruising with a brew, Canuck, of course.  JF"
264980,BillM,2008-11-06 00:20:00,17367,At least the conspiracy theories and socialist rants are good for a laugh.
264984,Guest lundboy,2008-11-06 00:24:00,0," Yep, we'll all be laughing soon enough  If you don't think B.O. is a socialist then you don't know the meaning of the word socialist.  Or is there an acceptable degree of socialism that makes it not socialist?  Brzezinski is a notorious socialist."
264988,Roy,2008-11-06 00:30:00,13728,I guess some folks just don't understand what congratulation means.
264989,Marty,2008-11-06 00:32:00,873,"He deserves one huge congratulations.  He made history and ran a fabulous campaign.  He's has no excuses.  He'll have all the support he'll need in Congress.    What scares me is how he conceded last night that he'll need a second term to make a difference.   I wonder what would have happened if he spoke those words before he was elected.  I voted for him but I am having some anxiety over it.   He sure can speak but he hasn't done anything remotely political in his lifetime.   He has the biggest stage in the world to make his debut.   The best election sign I saw said ""Vote and Pray"".  Didn't mention a candidate.   Perhaps the most sensible slogan out there.  We need some serious campaign reform here.    The money and negativity in this election was both ridiculous and offensive.  P.S.  I understand Rick wanted this to be a pat on the back to Obama thread.  I doubt he really believed it would stay that way.  The entire election was contentious and very negative and Obama got about 53% of the popular vote.  47% of the voters didn't vote for the guy.   The nature of this thread alone invites debate."
264770,bigfish1965,2008-11-05 04:15:00,3382,"This is a thread for congrats only. The people of the US have voted and decided. I for one am happy to see it happen and glad to be witness to such an historical event. The world is going to change....how, we will soon see. Dunno if Barak is a fisherman or not. Post replies respectfully...      PS. Joe, Art, GCD.....told ya so!"
264773,Wendel,2008-11-05 04:23:00,213,"I bet he fishes, what kind respectable man doesn't? lol Will be interesting to see what he can do with the hand he's been dealt."
264774,kemper,2008-11-05 04:24:00,2232,Congrats to Obama.  Talk about being dealt a shiite hand though.  It will be interesting to see how the markets react tomorrow.. oh ya and the S&P was once again correct in predicting the President...something like 80%

264895,Greencoachdog,2008-11-05 19:07:00,8163,"We'll see how he does, my guess is at this time next year you won't be able to find anybody white or black that voted for him... kinda like after Clinton's ""don't ask-don't tell"" policy and the monica blewinski oops... couldn't find a soul that voted for him then... kinda makes you wonder how he got elected."
264897,BillM,2008-11-05 19:24:00,17367,"  lol, how do you figure that?  You'd rather have another Bush in the office for 4 more years?  Obama is a step in the right direction if you ask me."
264909,packrat,2008-11-05 20:35:00,93,"It will be interesting over the next few months to see how well he does with all that authority.  Certainly going to be under the microscope with some factions.   ""Nothing is as powerfull as an idea whose time has come"""
264918,Rich,2008-11-05 21:03:00,3927,Congrats Obama.  Bush fished and hunted.   just sayin.
264921,lookinforwalleye,2008-11-05 21:12:00,4399,"Yes historical event indeed, but what exactly is everybody expecting from this guy? He is one man and he still has to bend over to the political elite and the power brokers. Is he going to wave his magic ""it time for change"" wand and fix everything.  Kinda scary watching some of the people on TV last night looking at this man like they were in a trance, I was half expecting to see lightning bolts rain down from the sky.  After everything is said and done just remember that he is still a politician."
264925,misfish,2008-11-05 21:28:00,29133," Yes they are,but maybe this ,politician,can bring the US OF A back to where it was. He has no need for war,nor a father to carry out what he could not finish. I for one, look forward to seeing what this man can bring.  IMO"
264941,Rich Clemens,2008-11-05 22:20:00,3131,"I'm glad to see Barak won as well.  I just hope now, that the American people will give him a fair chance."

264949,Roy,2008-11-05 22:56:00,13728,This thread was started to congratulate President Elect Barak Obama not to start/fuel conspiracy theories.
264950,JohnF,2008-11-05 22:58:00,3494,"I'm neither liberal or conservative in American political terms, but going in I favoured McCain, although the idea of anything not Bush was appealing. I was disappointed when McCain let himself be over-handled in the campaign. He didn't come across as the guy I was expecting, the maverick, and having to carry a newby like Palin probably weighed heavy on his campaigning.  During the debates I definitely got the impression that Obama was better equipped for the role of statesman, although in terms of history I thought McCain had the goods. The GOP handlers kinda blew it for McCain though with their attempts at making him into a confrontational hardliner, obviously something counter to his nature. I think I'd like John McCain as a buddy, probably better than Barack Obama, but fate, and their handlers' judgement, have given the world Obama as a President. One can only hope that he's more than just a black candidate and can assume the reins of leadership of the greatest (most powerful) nation in the world. That cloak of American greatness is in dire danger of shifting to some Asian shoulders unless Obama et al prove worthy of the responsibility. Good luck to him and the USA in sustaining their role as world leader. I'm cheering here.  JF"
264951,Terry,2008-11-05 23:02:00,14456,if history holds true the grassy knoll will be getting a work out.....   I hope it's not true
264952,Mike Pike,2008-11-05 23:03:00,1332,"I love McCain and the hard life he had and and war he's fought.  If I was an American, I would have voted for McCain if he was running against anybody OTHER than Obama.  In 'my' perfect world, Barak wins and McCain is Vice President."
264955,Jigger,2008-11-05 23:09:00,1237,"I disagree that this thread should ever have been started. Since it is here though, I'll say that I'm very pleased that as many people got out and looked past racial boundaries to elect a black man into office. Definately a moment in history and one to be proud of in terms of humanity moving forward.  That being said, I'm very dissapointed in the Canadian voters who couldn't give a flying flock to get out and create the kind of movement that we saw yesterday in our neighbours down South.  Congrats Obama, hope what Irishfield said doesn't come to fruition. I kind of expect the same, unfortunately."
264958,Guest lundboy,2008-11-05 23:14:00,0," Conspiracy theories only exist for people who keep their head in the sand  The guys background and voting record speak for themselves.  People chose to ignore them and will pay the price.  (Not that they were given any real choices outside of Chuck Baldwin or Ron Paul)  After all his ""advisor"" is Zbigniew Brzezinski http://www.newswithviews.com/Briley2/patrick103.htm You wanna know what's in store read this: http://www.scribd.com/doc/6226735/Between-...niew-Brzezinski  Paul Martin's mentor, Maurice Strong was almost as despicable."
