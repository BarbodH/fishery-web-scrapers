264487,Rizzo,2008-11-04 02:33:00,4754,"The past 2 years I have caught an unusually high number of good size walleye while musky fishing. I'm talking 6 pound plus fish caught on big baits fished at a pretty good speed (hint to those who want walleye...speed up and get some bigger baits!). Last year I caught a real beauty on Head Lake on a suick, and a giant on Balsam on a 9 inch sledge. I think this next fish is the biggest one yet, and it hit the biggest bait yet. Caught this one in the Trent Severn system last week under bluebird skies in the middle of the day. It was caught in 30 feet of water while I was trolling a deep diving 12 inch custom musky bait made by OFC'er Robin (who I haven't heard from lately unfortunately). No offense, but these fish must taste REALLY good because I can't see anyone targetting them for the fight! It measured in at 28.5 inches in length and a girth of 15 inches. I generally don't weigh fish because I like to get them back in the water as soon as possible, but if anyone has a thought on the weight of this fish please post it here (and then I will give you the co-ordinates of where it was caught)  "
264489,irishfield,2008-11-04 02:36:00,26272,Quit playing with the bait and get back to fishing Rizzo !  What a pig.... 8.75 to 9.25 lbs
264490,Sinker,2008-11-04 02:40:00,8692,Beauty!!  I'd say Wayne has the weight right on!!  Sinker
264492,Joey,2008-11-04 02:42:00,9122,"Wow, that's a beauty Roger.  Why don't you go with even bigger baits and maybe you can get one like Paul's  Joey"
264501,kemper,2008-11-04 03:03:00,2232,Gigantic fish for the system
264515,highdrifter,2008-11-04 03:26:00,2534,Holly free hollies!  I feel your pain..  NOT.  I'd say darn near close to 10lbs.  NOICE. HD
264518,ccmtcanada,2008-11-04 03:37:00,7971,Wow...what a huge fish for that waterway!!!  I'd say 8 to 9 pounds as well.  Not a bad consolation prize I'd say!
264526,ehg,2008-11-04 04:13:00,2666,"That fish i would guess 8.5 to 9.5 lbs. Real nice fish for that type of water.  For comparison, caught this walleye in Kawarthas over 10 yrs. ago. It was 30 inches. It gave the fight of its life. Quick picture, then when releasing it was dead. Kept it therefore and it was 9.25 lbs.   You caught a nice, rare walleye for up there."
264530,Raf,2008-11-04 04:25:00,3495,"i got this one on thanksgiving trolling a 9"" grandma.   thought i had weeds.  nope.. just a wetsox.    i will see if i can find the pic of one JP caught throwing a big bobbie bait in 5' of weedy water.  it was a hog too."
264544,2 tone z71,2008-11-04 07:29:00,1311,Monsters man great walleye pics
264545,lew,2008-11-04 08:45:00,12767,"Beautiful fish Roger, infact far bigger than normal for the Kawarthas. It's always interesting when you latch onto something your not expecting.  On the other end of the scale, here's a little dink that wasn't paying too much attention to what he was grabbing onto  "
264546,Greencoachdog,2008-11-04 10:46:00,8163,Beautiful fish Rizz!!!  Thanks for taking the time to post that one!!!
264548,mattyk,2008-11-04 11:00:00,2110,great fish!
264550,Rich,2008-11-04 11:23:00,3927,"Aww man, you must be so embarassed to be holding that walleye when you wanted musky. lol  What a kawartha beast!"
264579,Headhunter,2008-11-04 13:41:00,5703,"Really nice fish for that body of water...congrats! Just goes to show that if you wanna catch big fish, especially this time of year, ya gotta use big baits! HH"
264583,azanier,2008-11-04 13:44:00,23,Very nice!
264585,snag,2008-11-04 13:47:00,1932,Man those are nice fish!
264598,Rizzo,2008-11-04 14:54:00,4754,"Thanks for the comments, and for posting other great ""incidental' walleye photos. I was hoping to hear ""10 pounder"" but I guess I'll have to settle for 9'ish. I certainly was shocked to catch one that big for the body of water"
264677,steelhedrmatt,2008-11-04 21:54:00,278,Cool when that happens.  Here's one that was real hungry. full size sinking bulldog. also caught in the Trent.  My Brother still brags about this one.     
264699,Mike the Pike,2008-11-04 23:10:00,3421,Is that the same report as last year  I would say 7 to 8lbs
264723,buckster,2008-11-05 00:28:00,530,"I got this while trolling a 10"" jake on pigeon It was 32"" long didn't weigh it but i think she went well over 10"
264725,buckster,2008-11-05 00:35:00,530,"oh and this one was 30"" and it hit a 10"" beleiver we took out this youngster and his dad for a shot at skis"
264752,GbayGiant,2008-11-05 02:24:00,1780,"The small ones think there big too, got this trolling 5mph at night, fish was only a couple inches bigger than the lure.   "
264785,gone_fishin,2008-11-05 05:13:00,481,here's a 28 incher from Chemong... 6Lb 14ozs (on a digital scale)... roughly the same length as yours... yours looks a little fatter however... so definitely over 7Lbs and probably pushing 8... NICE FISH!!!  
264863,Rizzo,2008-11-05 17:19:00,4754," wow, good memory...but no. I think I posted one I caught up near Parry Sound last year that went about 6 pounds but that was a different fish"
