Of note were these two:  2 x Garmin eTrex Legend Cx (colour with expanded memory capability) $100 ea. 1 x Garmin eTrex H (high sensitivity receiver) $93.  Some other non-notable units were available as well.  These would be great to mark favorite fishing or hunting spots.  Cheers, Barnie"

264747,Dabluz,2008-11-05 02:03:00,701,The Legend CX for 100 dollars is an excellent price.  A good 50% off.  This unit has the colour screen and expandable memory slot.  That makes it just as good as the 60C or the 76C except it does not have magnetic north (points to north when standing still) nor the altimeter.
