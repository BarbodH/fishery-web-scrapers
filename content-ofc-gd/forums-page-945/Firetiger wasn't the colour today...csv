264063,irishfield,2008-11-02 23:21:00,26272,......or many others for that matter!!  Out with Terry today on GBay from 9am to about 4:15. Water temp is about 46/47F.  Terry had one nice hard rip (in 27 feet of water) at about 9:20. That was it for the day.. other than this good fight Terry had.
264065,Terry,2008-11-02 23:24:00,14456,yeah you might say the fishing was slow  but it was still a good day on the water
264079,Dondorfish,2008-11-02 23:39:00,1000,Sounds much like our day yesterday on Quinte - oh well -better days ahead. I't still nice to get out on the water.  Don
264081,irishfield,2008-11-02 23:41:00,26272," Not sure about that Don.... is what is says on my Fathers Tombstone.  ""There are better days ahead"". Now why my Mother picked that... I'll never know!"
264082,tinbanger,2008-11-02 23:42:00,1028,"Full windshield and gloves   what wimps LOL   Actualy I had the mitts on today , sure was windy Boys.  Sorry to hear you didn't have much action , still lots of time  TB"
264083,irishfield,2008-11-02 23:44:00,26272,HAHA Dave... it was brisk out there. -3C to start the day and blowing pretty good. We came back across the open sound in 5 to 6 footers.
264084,Dondorfish,2008-11-02 23:44:00,1000,  Don
264087,tinbanger,2008-11-02 23:47:00,1028,"sounds like the weather a couple of weeks back , at least it wasn't raining ! TB"
264105,GbayGiant,2008-11-03 00:18:00,1780,"You'll get'em next time. So much for that nice day the weather network predicted 2 days ago, lol,  still says 15-16 degrees all week now, we'll see.  You guys left at the best time of day ? were you getting cold out there."
264107,Terry,2008-11-03 00:22:00,14456,no I had to get home......I think Wayne would have stayed for hours more.......
264110,irishfield,2008-11-03 00:26:00,26272,I think we did John... there was a minor moon phase from 10:09 to 11:09 and a major from 3:52 to 5:52. We got to fish them both... well 15 minutes of the major anyhow...... so Terry could get home before dark. Something about a child hood tramatic experience... LOL
264112,GbayGiant,2008-11-03 00:30:00,1780, I see.
264118,Terry,2008-11-03 00:41:00,14456,ah...it was dark before I got to midland 2 eye surgeries  and now driving in the dark is not the most fun part of the day  but it does make for an interesting time
264125,BillM,2008-11-03 00:55:00,17367,"Wayne, this day seems vaguely similar to one we had a few months ago"
264274,Bly,2008-11-03 14:21:00,1556,"Wayne, Terry.....I can sympathize"
264417,Joey,2008-11-03 23:49:00,9122,"Hey, it happens.  At least Terry got the adrenaline flowing for awhile.  You sure it wasn't a sheephead you lost Terry  Joey"
