My buddy landed a nice 4-5 pounder and a little shaker, but we left.  Headed to a different trib and he lands a 6 pounder on the first drift.  He ended up going 5/9 and I went 2/4. Thats the true dfference between a float reel and a spinning reel, I got schooled.  Man, I need to replace that float reel SOON!!  Fun morning out!  Water was clear, but for some reason the better fish were coming on big bright bags  "
264627,highdrifter,2008-11-04 18:33:00,2534,Yah the bigger roe bags still seem to pull fish..  Nicely done.  cheers HD
264663,wallacio,2008-11-04 20:25:00,475,"Nice fish, though I'm not following your logic on the float reel vs spinning reel comment as it relates to number of fish hooked (or landed) by you or your friend?"
264665,misfish,2008-11-04 20:59:00,29133,Nice fish Steve. This time of year I like the quarter zise bags verses the dime size. Congrats on the catches.
264666,dobee,2008-11-04 21:00:00,301,nice fish man!
264675,steverowbotham,2008-11-04 21:50:00,1800," A float reel gives you a much smoother, more natural drift.  It is much simpler to keep contact with your float.  The way the line spools off a spinning reel, there is generally more slack, then the line gets caught in the current and pulls the float unnaturally.  Last spring I used my buddies extra float reel all season and get sooooo many more fish with it.  A new one is on my christmas list."
264678,Paulus,2008-11-04 21:54:00,522, LOL! I can tell by the fast water in the background that the spinning reel made a huge difference  Maybe you should've bummed some roe bags from your buddy  p.-
264681,wallacio,2008-11-04 22:10:00,475,"  Gotcha, no argument there.   I just assumed that you had a float reel and were implying that your buddy with a spinning reel outfished you.   Hope Santa comes through for you!"
264682,solopaddler,2008-11-04 22:18:00,8605,"Nice fish Steve, glad to see you got out and caught one.  (A float reel is of little advantage in those types of waters. Careful manipulation of a spinning reel will reap the same results. If we ever get the chance to fish together I'll show you what I mean  )"
264689,rhare,2008-11-04 22:52:00,387,"who needs a float reel, if you spent less time on those damn bass you'd have the trout down to an art with a spinning reel!!  better yet get a set up with a nice light baitcast reel, the free spool is just as easy to control with your thumb.   Steve you coming down to the Niagara this fall???  Get your NYS liscense and lets get out!!!"
264708,steverowbotham,2008-11-04 23:33:00,1800," Seeing as I tied em all. haha  I dunno, he outfished me for sure."
264745,figureight,2008-11-05 01:58:00,40,Some of the best anglers I know that fish those ditches use spinning reels. Really makes no difference in that water.
