263784,Sinker,2008-11-01 13:25:00,8692,The MNR has a program going around here to try and gather some evidence about them. They have hair traps and trail cams set up on one property I hunt!! Some mornings its a little spooky waiting for legal shooting time to roll around.......They are around for sure!  Sinker
263797,pike slayer,2008-11-01 15:30:00,1177,i know theres lots in the sault area. my buddys dad works for the mnr and he said between 2005-2006 they captured 29 and relocated them to more remote locations. they dont want to go around and tell everyone cause it will just scare ppl.
263822,Billy Bob,2008-11-01 18:44:00,5865," I have to agree 100% with Sdog.  NONE ever trapped, none ever shot, none ever REALLY photographed. Sounds more like another possible BIGFOOT legend developing with NOW a possible escaped illegal pet on the loose."
263823,BUSTER,2008-11-01 18:53:00,1336,"lol you guy are joking right? iam born raised sudbury/elliot lk , 100% for sure they are here"
263828,misfish,2008-11-01 19:13:00,29133,"I would like to KNOW why you guys think,they are not here????????????????????? Our climate can sustain them,we have the wild life to feed them. For me I have ,pretty much sure have,seen one on my way up north. Theres no way Garfield looked this big."
263861,Cookslav,2008-11-01 21:35:00,1457,"I don't know how ""easy"" it is to hunt cougars? Maybe with a pack of hounds you could run one up a tree, but simply tracking down a cougar would be pretty tough IMO. that...and there is no season here in Ontario, so why would one try.  I think the evidence starting to pile up...only a matter of time till the MNR confirms it"
263869,Billy Bob,2008-11-01 22:34:00,5865, Well it's simply evidence. Have you trapped any or have you shot any. If not have any of your neighbors trapped any or shot any and if so do you have any pictures of said animals. This is WHY your DEC list them as a MAYBE for our discussion. UNTIL then they are just another BIGFOOT.
263871,irishfield,2008-11-01 22:40:00,26272,Strange that we need to retain or kill them to know that they're there. I know there's a Lynx on my Island in Temagami and I didn't need to get the rifle out to prove it ! That  Cormorant.. well that's another story... lol !
263878,FISHEYEZ,2008-11-01 23:13:00,49,"read through the post,   I am still laughing about all the ""cougar"" cracks. I am originally from London,ON and there were always sightings being reported in and around that area too, however they are always said to be ""Western"" Cougar, which are used as pets, or made their way here...  ""Eastern"" cougars are extinct..??"
263888,Billy Bob,2008-11-01 23:43:00,5865,"SO, then you can't be cited for shooting one and have it stuff (or trapped) and shown, HOWEVER where are these specimens ? ? ? Oh, there are coming as evidence right after they process the Loch Ness Monster and  Big Foot.............."
264003,Big Cliff,2008-11-02 16:59:00,6899,"I don't care if MNR or anyone else believes there are cougars in Ontario. Last spring I had one not 30' away from me while I was out on my deck early one morning. My neighbour saw it too but didn't realize what he had seen until we started talking about it the next day. It was early and still dark, he heard the noise and turned on his yard lights and saw something large in the yard, he thought it might have been a wolf, he never expected a cougar.  Believe it or not, doesn't matter to me, I KNOW what I saw and heard!"
264007,Muskieman,2008-11-02 17:27:00,2472,I am 100%  positive that they are here.
264031,bucktail,2008-11-02 20:14:00,1857,Cougars easy to hunt???   HAHAHAHA Your serious? without dogs you will NEVER see one. I have hunted out west for 15 years in a area that has lots. Seen prints in the snow once. That was after it stalked ME back to the cabin one night. My buddie who lives there and works the area every day has seen one live one. two dead from cars. There like smoke in the woods.
264035,Cookslav,2008-11-02 20:40:00,1457," Exsactly my thoughts. Cougars are extremely quiet, and smart preditors. I'd say the same for Lynx, and bobcat.... I know 100% they are here...the MNR agrees, and yet I've never seen a print left behind, or a kill site. Smart animals, that are usualy 2 steps ahead of us....unless you throw a pack of hounds after them"
264037,fishing n autograph,2008-11-02 20:49:00,2540,"Personally I haven't seen any Cougar in Ontario. I remember seeing one on the side of 1-495 in New York State though.  But just because I haven't seen one or taken a pic of one doesn't mean that I don't believe that they;re making a comeback. I'm sure I'll see one at some point,  But I remember MuskieStudd telling me one of his neighbours saw one in his neighbourhood"
264132,ehg,2008-11-03 01:06:00,2666,According to the above account it sounds like MNR has caught some but does'nt want to panic folks. Most of new reports on map are generally south of former range. We will see eventually i guess.
264140,nofish4me,2008-11-03 01:31:00,404," Saw one that looked like this, once. It had an Adam's Apple, pretty sure it was a male."

264187,John Bacon,2008-11-03 03:38:00,3277,My brother-in-law swears that he saw one on the ice on Baptiste Lake.
264210,singingdog,2008-11-03 10:40:00,1047,"When I said ""easy to hunt"" I meant with dogs...sorry, should have clarified that. Still waiting for a pic, even of some tracks."
264250,pameladallaire,2008-11-03 13:32:00,470,"Hi Everyone:  Just to clarify, the MNR does not trap and relocate pumas in Ontario, the trail cameras set up on properties are most likely the property of the Ontario Puma Foundation and anyone seeing a cougar in Ontario can email me or go to The Ontario Puma Foundation website to report a sighting.  I am the secretary of the foundation.  If you have questions, please feel free to contact me.  Thanks Nemo for posting the map.  Pam Dallaire  [emailÂ protected]"
264509,kemper,2008-11-04 03:14:00,2232,"I spotted a big cat up in the collingwood area one evening after coming off the slopes and heading to the car. I am not sure what it was, (probably not quite big enough to be a cougar) but it was big, wild and made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck"
263556,Pondo,2008-10-31 14:13:00,36,"Durham police are warning Pickering residents of a possible mountain lion on the loose.  ""We have heard of two independent reports describing an animal similar to a mountain lion, obviously we have to take that seriously,"" Durham Regional Police spokesman Dave Selby said.  Both sightings were in the area of Douglas Park in the Liverpool Rd. and Bayly St. area.  The first report was made to Pickering Animal Services on Oct. 16 by an adult walking in the park. The agency received a second report from a 12-year-old boy on Wednesday.  ""It could very well be an exotic pet on the loose,"" Selby said. ""Years ago, we had tiger sightings reported and it turns out someone was keeping a tiger as an exotic pet and it broke free, so that's definitely a possibility.""  Native mountain lions, or cougars, have not been seen in Ontario since 1884, Ministry of Natural Resources spokesman John Cooper said.  He advises residents in the area to be alert to wildlife, to travel in groups and to stay out out of wooded areas at dusk and dawn.  ""It's also a good idea to carry a whistle and use it to scare off the animal,"" Cooper said. ""If you see an animal that you feel threatened by, call 911 immediately.""  Anyone with information about this investigation is asked to call Durham police at 1-888-579-1520."
263557,ccmtcanada,2008-10-31 14:25:00,7971,Heard this on the news as well!!  Brian...try to control yourself on this one ok?? LOL
263558,silveradosheriff,2008-10-31 14:26:00,1025,Ah crap - wrong kind of cougars....
263561,johnnyb,2008-10-31 14:34:00,3413,"Cougars not seen in Ontario since 1884?  Are there other kinds of cougars (the animals, I mean...not the kind that hang out in bars!) in Ontario?  Because I'm sure there was one at the cottage a few years back, and a friend who grew up in Temagami said his dad, former OPP, had an encounter with one.  I know they're rare, but, 1884?"
263564,jwl,2008-10-31 14:39:00,1056,"not that uncommon over the last few years..there is a guy across the road at my trailer whom I have been talking to about this over the last couple years..he has on occassion gone out with the MNR to help investigate livestock killings in the Prince Edward County area, and upon thier investigations they found fur on a fence in a couple places that there where livestock killings and they did indeed prove through DNA tests come to the conclusion it was cougars in the area.   I also know that as part of a wildlife rehab program over a few years they have introduced radio collared cougars in a couple areas up through that way."
263566,DRIFTER_016,2008-10-31 14:54:00,10439,"I don't know what the big deal is, there were pics posted a week ago of the Bronte Cougar!!!!  "
263568,mbac31,2008-10-31 15:00:00,904,They are around here. We had a note in our mailbox 2 years ago about 2 cougars in our area. We were told to keep our animals under watch as well as our kids. One of my workers saw one or a large cat while taking the work truck home last year at Meadowvale and old finch crossing near the bridge. I think they have been introduced again by the Ministry. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Cougars same deal, but it would be really neat to be able to photograph it, as long as it doesn't maul me.."

263758,singingdog,2008-11-01 10:19:00,1047,"I'm not ready to buy the ""there's cougars in Ontario"" story yet. I know that there has been DNA proof of some droppings, but I believe it was an escapee.  If there are wild cougars in Ontario, where are the photos, paw prints, kill sites, shot animals....? As outdoorguy says, they are not difficult to hunt, with either a gun or a camera. We get the same 'sitings' in this area, but somehow nobody ever walks over and finds tracks where the cougar was walking."
263762,Muskieman,2008-11-01 11:09:00,2472,"We have a population here in West Nipissing...in fact less than 2 miles from my place ,,  A local farmer on Stewart Rd ...has pics...and Laurentian University professors are here regularly they set up cameras and such in trees....so far there are 4 confirmed individual cats.  The local cops are also aware of them..  My family and I have personally seen one on Clear Lk  Rd  this past labor day weekend.  No doubt in my mind that they're here in  Ontario.   RFS"
