264519,jdmls,2008-11-04 03:42:00,575,Nicely done there sir .... Beutiful fish    Keep em coming !!
264237,solopaddler,2008-11-03 13:01:00,8605,"I received an invite from my buddy Dave who's family owns an amazing waterfront cottage right in the heart of steelhead country up north to come up fish for a couple days. Joining us was our mutual friend Joe, one of my companions on the Alaskan trip.  Saturday far exceeded my expectations. The conditions were perfect: high, but very clear water. Normally on this river you're restricted to fishing the deeper holes as most of the river is just too skinny, but we hit fish everywhere on Saturday. The added water depth allowed the fish some measure of security and we found them in fast water pockets behind boulders, riffles, and tailouts that are normally rock gardens.  The uber clear water called for fluorocarbon tippets, but we had to run at least 6lb test or run the risk of losing fish. Small micro roe bags tied in white were the ticket, although Dave shocked at least one fish into smashing his pink plastic worm  .  There's definitely something to be said for wild steelhead, their power is just unreal. So hard and muscular they're incredibly hard to hold with every muscle twitching and quivering. They just never give up! These fish were all pure chrome and absolutely electric. If they had hair it would've been standing on end  .                                           Saturday evening we enjoyed our apres fish at Dave's place right on the water. What an incredible spot!        The money shot    Couldn't have been a more perfect day!  Sunday we fished a different river for just the morning. I hit one brute of a fish that just smoked me, snapping my tippet like thread...and that was it. Around 10:30 we decided to cut our losses and head home to our families earlier than expected. (Brownie points in the bank for next weekend  ).   The next couple of weeks are shaping up to be very prime if you're a steelhead fisherman. Get out and enjoy boys while it lasts!  Cheers,  Mike"

264257,BillM,2008-11-03 13:46:00,17367,"Mike,  Sounds like you had a great time!  Looks like I missed it by a day on the Saugeen.  My buddy hooked into 12 on the Sat, we hooked into 2 on the friday  Ah well, atleast it's raining in Barrie today, The Notty should be prime soon enough."
264261,solopaddler,2008-11-03 13:59:00,8605," Good stuff Bill. We contemplated the Saugeen for Sunday, wish we would have tried it. You're bang on about the Notty!"

264285,troutologist,2008-11-03 14:41:00,951,Another beauty day Mike. Good work.  Man am I getting primed up for the trip in a few weeks.  Keep it up!
264287,irishfield,2008-11-03 14:42:00,26272,When you said up North... well not quite where I thought ! LOL  Great stuff Mike !
264302,tonyb,2008-11-03 15:35:00,1637,"Simply amazing It's great that you take the time out to get some quality photos of fish.  Those wild fish sure look mean and lean, big difference to those 'other' fish that are in greater abundance south of the border"
264304,kemper,2008-11-03 15:48:00,2232,"amazing as usual!  Im getting my ars kicked by chrome so far this season, can wait to get into  some quality ones like that!  and you can always tell the difference between a wild fish and a stocker, they are just pure muscle"
264306,wallacio,2008-11-03 15:53:00,475,"A great weekend for sure Mike...I'm glad that you and Joe were able to make it up for a weekend at the cottage.   It's obviously a special place for me an my family, where we've made life-long friendships and spend as much time up there as possible.  The fact that it's so close to many fantastic rivers which see runs of wild Steelhead is just icing on the cake.  Too bad they didn't cooperate for us on Sunday but Saturday more than made up for things.  Looking forward to the next trip...with the girls still in Florida I'll be out again this weekend!"
264310,solopaddler,2008-11-03 16:07:00,8605,"  A special place is an understatement bud, I feel fortunate for the invite! Next 2-3 weeks are going to be fun indeed."
264311,tbayboy,2008-11-03 16:08:00,1497,"Another beautiful report Mike, thanks for sharing and reminding us that the hard water season is still a while off."
264313,douG,2008-11-03 16:13:00,2693,"Thanks for sharing your trip, Mike.  Great photos too."
