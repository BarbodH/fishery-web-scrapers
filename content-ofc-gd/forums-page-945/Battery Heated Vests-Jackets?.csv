I've seen some for hunters and bikers but have no experience with these vests/jackets.  I did a google search and found most are plug into the vehicle battery but I'm looking for battery operated ones.  I've looked at the sites from brookstone, widder, and staywarm. I'd prefer to buy from a Canadian store/distributor if possible.  Thanks for any info.  Stan"
