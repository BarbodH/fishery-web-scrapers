245388,Wild,2008-09-01 15:15:00,704,I guess there's not too much promotion yet and not the full range of products available like the USA but let's see how this grows.  I guess SIR was bought by Cabela's?  http://www.sirmailorder.ca/index.php?PHPSE...d1819b9dbebfee9
245392,glen,2008-09-01 15:25:00,2641,Thanks Wild.  It will come in handy if the dollar drops.
245428,Wild,2008-09-01 16:23:00,704,"looking at the order form the prices are in CDN funds and of course purchasing out of Provence means no PST  well except for Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland &  Labrador  which Add 13% Harmonized.  So depending on overall shipping costs Cabala's may have the right idea here."
245452,MCTFisher9120,2008-09-01 17:24:00,3761,Neat thanks for the link.
245455,misfish,2008-09-01 17:28:00,29133,"Theres a rumor going around here, that Cabelas is coming to the new mall thats being built at the old Molson park place."
245456,Fang,2008-09-01 17:30:00,1330,Was at the Cabelas(old SIR) this summer in Winnipeg. Had only recently converted over from SIR so stock was still fairly low. Prices very high but I think that was mostly due to Winnipeg and not Cabelas. Great hunting section though. Could have stayed for a few hours but only had about 30 minutes to kill
245463,Scott S,2008-09-01 17:39:00,203,I also heard of a fishing store but did not no what company. That would be awsome if this were true. I better start working some overtime!
245532,Wild,2008-09-01 19:17:00,704,"""The company had previously announced plans to build a store in Montreal in time for a fall of 2009 or spring of 2010 opening. Highby said its Canadian division could be worth US$200 million annually when it's fully established. He said he and Cabela's co-founder, Jim Cabela, both of whom met with S.I.R. employees on Wednesday night, have been well aware of S.I.R. and its position in the marketplace because they have hunted and fished across Canada for more than 30 years""  Just a small snip from this statement:  http://www.sirmailorder.ca/news_view.php?id=49  And I know that BPS is building in or around Montreal so Ontario must be next."
245603,carp-starter,2008-09-01 22:20:00,253,I saw that Cabela's website a couple of days ago. It is too bad that it has nothing much on fly tying. For me it has nothing.  At the start of 2007 I was under the impression that Cabela's was going to open a store in the spring of 2008 in Mirabel (north west of Montreal). Then I find out that BPS is going to open their store there. What happened? Or was I wrong? I was making plans to visit my Mom in Montreal in 2008. But I guess Cabela's had other plans.  I hope Cabela's opens a store at the old Molson's Park. BPS in Vaughan does not excite me and I have not been to this store so far.  I get the feeling that Cabela's as a store is on level one. And BPS is on level two. Only my feelings.  carp-starter
245685,SlowPoke,2008-09-02 01:22:00,2984,"I thought the same until I visited BP at Great Lakes Crossing. The staff was friendlier, store was cleaner/more organized and many of the prices were better than Cabela's in Dundee. The Vaughn BP store is nice enough but is ""level two"" compared to the Great Lakes Crossing location. -Brian"
245693,Fisherman,2008-09-02 01:32:00,7201,
245700,Rattletrap2,2008-09-02 01:44:00,1652,"I would agree with Slowpoke on this one! Michigan BPS is miles ahead of BPS Vaughn, and I also found the Cabelas store in Michigan  seemed to be going downhill. I've been to both of them many times over the year, but was very disappointed with cabelas last month. The stock in the store was depleted and employees did not seem to care much.  I really like the Gander Mountain stores too. Not as big as the others, but some good deals to be had and very friendly staff."
245758,sharper,2008-09-02 04:00:00,279,"It'll be great to have a cabela's here in Ontario, some competition for BPS."
245818,BillM,2008-09-02 13:21:00,17367," Now that would rock!!!  (Not like weekend commuter traffic needs to get any worse up here, lol)"
245841,Wild,2008-09-02 15:14:00,704,I don't think that Ontario is on the list yet at least according to Cabela's but Montreal is still in the works.
245868,danbo,2008-09-02 16:34:00,2646,LeBaron's gets my business..
264767,Wild,2008-11-05 03:53:00,704,"Cabela's Canada winter/holiday catalog has just arrived from Winnipeg. 227 pages thick filled with great hunting, fishing,outdoor gear all in Canadian $. Some Canadian exclusive items too. Well done Cabela's!"
