264363,Terry,2008-11-03 20:12:00,14456,"well lakers have been closed for over a month, so I wouldn't go after them  smallies are being caught lots out from the tiffin launch pike I don't know"
264371,Governator,2008-11-03 20:57:00,879,"I don't think there are pike in kempenfelt, the bulk are all in cook's bay.  Kemp is however loaded with fat perch right now."
264379,steverowbotham,2008-11-03 21:31:00,1800,"   Think again fella.  There's lots of big pike in Kempenfelt, caught them up to 41 inches."
264386,Governator,2008-11-03 21:47:00,879,"  Schaweet, I didn't know that (nice pic ).  I guess everyone always just names Cook's as the pike spot.  I gotta give kempenfelt a try then."
264482,Cudz,2008-11-04 02:23:00,2652,I have caught several pike in Kempenfelt including some nice 30+ inchers
