264527,krawler,2008-11-04 04:20:00,167,"Hoping to get out this weekend for some shallow water rainbow fishing with the mast and big boards.  i was hoping to go to the mouth of the notty or near collingwood.  Im assuming the bows should be in 15 fow give or take.  ive never had any success with planer boards, some success flatlining, mind you ive only ever done either a handful of times.  since im fishing in 15 fow using J5's, and ac shiners, i guess there is no point letting over 100 feet of line out.  should my leads be casting distance, 30 or so feet.  Troll aimlessely along the shoreline.  should i be looking for structure, deeper water, shallower.  basically any tips would be appreciated.  thanks"
264535,kemper,2008-11-04 04:44:00,2232,Since they can be  caught within casting distance of shore I assume depth is not a big issue. When I was surf casting last weekend I noticed some guys in little mini pontoon boat thingers flat line trolling 100 ft from shore and doing well

I think the more important question that should be asked is how far out from the boat should your boards be running? Given the clarity of the water and the fact that those lake residing trout are not accustomed to boats/motors, I would very seriously consider running your boards out as far as you can, to get yer baits in front of boat flaring fish.
