Thought I was just going to have the morning off so I didn't venture out of town and instead tried my usual spots in the downtown area.  Got absolutely nothing where I figured I would catch fish and then caught one fish where I was least expecting it.  Only fish of the day.  Caught it a 5 minute walk from my front door   Hooked  it about 5' from shore on my 3rd cast and thought it was a pike.  19.5 "" long.  I've now caught 2 that big in the Thames, thats my personal best.  Just under 3 lbs.  So yeah, pickerel are still around   This one was a fatty.    "

264459,Beats,2008-11-04 01:27:00,543,"I ate the fish for dinner and noticed that it had a single minnow in its stomach that was about the size of the knife handle pictured.  What a pig.  It looked way too big for the fish.  It looked like a 5"" or so smelt.  Probably wasn't a smelt, but that's what it looked like.  So I guess they are bulking up.  That's fine by me."
