Palin can take a joke but the guy at the end of the interview in the background kept saying ""hang up"" is the one who needs to develop a sense of humour.  It reminded me of the time Rick Mercer ambushed George Bush and asked how he would work with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Poutine. Bush replied that he looked forward to working with Prime Minister Poutine because he was a good leader and well respected.  Too Bad our leader was Jean Cretien and poutine is french fried potatoes with gravy and cheese on top.  People speculated that the reason Bush never made a trip to Canada to meet the Prime Minister for almost a year after his inauguration was because he was puncked so badly by Canadian Television"
