263875,Rich,2008-11-01 22:47:00,3927,"I know tiny creeks around here, some the size of ditches that get good runs of salmon every fall.. why the heck would the Grand, the biggest in the area, seemingly not have a salmon run to speak of. Sure, the odd fish is seen every year, but you'd think there would be the biggest run around on a river that size. Always seemed weird to me."
263893,Musky or Specks,2008-11-02 00:07:00,2710,It is kind of weird that it gets a huge rainbow run but hardly any salmon.
263912,okumasheffield,2008-11-02 01:16:00,318,The only place I have seen people fishing for rainbow is the dam  Does anyone else know other places?
263914,Rich,2008-11-02 01:21:00,3927,From the dam down to Lake Erie is full of good holes. Try York or the upper reaches of Cayuga.
263927,danbo,2008-11-02 02:18:00,2646,Lake Erie is managed for Walleyes & Rainbow Trout. Lake Ontario for Salmon.
263946,purekgw,2008-11-02 04:06:00,585,salmon are in there u just have to find em we always do
263958,Rich,2008-11-02 10:57:00,3927," Ah, so there are no rainbows in Lake O, or walleyes. And no salmon in Lake Erie. gotcha."
263984,OhioFisherman,2008-11-02 13:53:00,6623,"Rich, the Black river on this side of Lake Erie I have caught steelhead around the break walls at the mouth of the river, but never in the river itself. It is deep (up to 35 feet) wide and not wading water. No idea why we don`t see them in the river itself, smallies, largemouth, panfish though. Funny though, also caught largemouth around the breakwalls 20 feet down with the smallies. Dumb fish!"
264024,aniceguy,2008-11-02 19:40:00,1094,"what salmon are in the lake wont reproduce in the grand and as the dam is an unpassable barrier to Salmon and there is no suitable spawing or juvinile habitat below, the rainbows you do catch are all wild fish that are reproducing above it...in 100 years or so the grand strain will be a genetically unique species to the great lakes so protecting them now is crucial."
264567,TerryC,2008-11-04 13:09:00,196,"I don't think they are all wild fish above the dam, we catch a few erie steelheads around Caledonia and even as far up as Brantford. There is however an ever growing population of resident trout, as you stated. There is know mistaking the two once you have seen them."
264572,pikehunter,2008-11-04 13:23:00,1659,Why can't they get over the dam? There is a ladder around the other side of the island. Although built for walleye wouldn't other species use it? Dunnville fishway
264578,Fishmaster,2008-11-04 13:39:00,920,There is still a good run of Salmon that come in the River ...not like when i was a kid when we use to catch 5 to 10 a day but there is still a good run ...and yes Salmon and Bows use the latter ...
264590,aniceguy,2008-11-04 13:58:00,1094,mind posting some info on Salmon using the ladder....
264601,LeXXington,2008-11-04 15:22:00,1928,"I think if there was a larger response to stocking salmon in the Grand it coud become a world class Salmon river. I prefer Salmon in Ontario and stocking walleye in Erie,  I thought long ago there was talk about removing the dunville dam or changing it too allow fish to pass."
