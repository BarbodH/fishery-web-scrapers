804087,SirCranksalot,2013-08-20 18:45:00,3291,Found this 'old fashioned' lure washed ashore on a lake up North. Anyone know roughly how old and brand? 
804088,lew,2013-08-20 18:49:00,12766,Vamp Spook maybe
804089,Headhunter,2013-08-20 19:05:00,5703,Creek Chub Pikie perhaps? HH
804111,Walleye72,2013-08-20 20:47:00,156,That looks to be an old South Bend Pikeoreno.
804112,fishindevil,2013-08-20 20:50:00,6254,Cool find for sure !!!! Clean it up and keep it as a lucky keepsake !!!!!
804115,Bill Shearer,2013-08-20 20:54:00,456,The paint job on the OPs photo does not match the Pike-Oreno 
804119,Twocoda,2013-08-20 20:58:00,4130,I had one almost exactly like that except it had a little propeller on the front and it wasnt a diver...i would guess the late 70s or early 80s but they may still make them today... so who knows?
804120,misfish,2013-08-20 21:01:00,29133,No stamped markings on the bill/metal diver?  Nice find.
804135,Walleye72,2013-08-20 21:44:00,156," I see that newer South Bend lures were  painted with that chevron pattern, but perhaps older versions were not.     Jeeze, it was just a guess."
804144,Bill Shearer,2013-08-20 22:10:00,456,"Not criticizing. Just try to eliminate the possibilities. That colour pattern has been used by many manufacturers over the years, and it is difficult to pinpoint. No matter which brand it is, it's still a cool find."
804145,Roy,2013-08-20 22:10:00,13728,"It might be ""old fashioned"" but it's not old. That's a rebuild of a rebuild. Strip it down, sand it with 400 paper, seal it and repaint it the colour you like, It'll be worth more. Clear coat it once or twice with Devcon or somesuch and change the hardware. Judging the size of the bait, 1/0 Mustads would be ok."
804146,vance,2013-08-20 22:16:00,719,I have one of those that my dad left me and I have no idea of who it was made by but it has to be pre 60s.Since it is a 5 hour drive away from me I cant be positive but I am pretty sure as he never bought new lures after that because the old ones ALWAYS caught fish..  vance
804216,SirCranksalot,2013-08-21 01:58:00,3291,Thx---that bottom pic looks quite similar to my lure.
804271,Renegade67,2013-08-21 12:12:00,86,"I found one in my gramps box back in about 80, used it once and caught the only rainbow (4-5lb) my family has ever caught where we are on G Bay.   Give it a try!   I thought it would work good for pike...."
804459,Beans,2013-08-22 14:53:00,3339,My first guess was a River Runt...then maybe a Pikie minnow...
804502,SirCranksalot,2013-08-22 20:45:00,3291,"It had a steel leader on it, so probably was targeting pike."
805397,t4runner,2013-08-28 21:53:00,37,Looks like a Creek Chub.
805419,johnnyb,2013-08-28 23:53:00,3413,My first thought was CC Pikie as well.  My buddy found one years ago and it sparked his interest in vintage tackle collecting
805628,rufus,2013-08-30 02:37:00,267,It is a Paw Paw Pike Minnow.
