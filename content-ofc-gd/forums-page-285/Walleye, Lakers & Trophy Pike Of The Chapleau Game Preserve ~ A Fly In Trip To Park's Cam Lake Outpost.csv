794855,spinnerdoc,2013-06-26 10:26:00,556,Why so serious? Looks like a great trip.
794858,solopaddler,2013-06-26 10:42:00,8605," Edwin, you'd love a trip like this! You'll have to join me on one sometime."
794914,kickingfrog,2013-06-26 16:49:00,8333,As a fellow somewhat heavy eyebrowed person I too am frequently accused of being too serious in photos. I usually ask them why they are so serious about me looking serious.
794922,fishnsled,2013-06-26 18:06:00,3520,"   In Bill's defense, I'd call this a smile...maybe a grin....a smirk???      Have to agree, fishing is serious business."
794923,BillM,2013-06-26 18:09:00,17367,"Anytime I smile I look like a goof, so this is what I've come up with  :)"
794928,solopaddler,2013-06-26 18:52:00,8605, Only when you smile? You sure about that?   You left the barn door hanging wide open with that one buddy.  
795042,msp,2013-06-27 02:30:00,1336,Looks like a great time. thanks for putting it all together

795157,lhousesoccer,2013-06-27 17:47:00,442,"Man ... another trip.  What's next?  A Mongolian float trip for giant taimen?  That's a beast of a pike, Mike.  Not the numbers in the size range that the 'Skat produces, but to get fish like that PLUS walleye, PLUS lakers, just awesome!"
795561,TDunn,2013-06-29 14:53:00,680,What an awesome trip and report! Thanks Mike!  TDunn
796032,fishboy,2013-07-02 14:17:00,550,"in a word, awesome!!"
805086,Slingfisher,2013-08-26 16:19:00,8,"My son corresponded with Mike when he was looking for a trip for us to take.  He had never done a fly-in before so it was a great way to try it out.  Thanks Mike for all the help.  Turns out my son was doing this without my knowledge and booked this trip for us for my Birthday.  What a nice surprise.  We went to Abbey lake (just the 2 of us) and Mike was very helpful in providing tips to help make our trip more enjoyable and successful.  Although the spots he suggested didn't produce, most likely because of the weather we quickly found some great spots and were on fish most of the time.  The cabin is very nice, boat comfortable and the motors are fairly new.  Most of the pickerel were 15-19"" as we were led to believe but we did catch one 24"" and a few around 21"". We had a different fish recipe every night.  Unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate as it was cloudy, rainy, windy and cold (with sleet on the Tuesday) all week.  Except of course the day we arrived and the day we departed, lol.  There's a great spot overlooking the lake where we put a couple of chairs and enjoyed a cocktail or cold beer every afternoon (weather be damned). Almost all our fish were caught in 8-15 FOW and we were sometimes almost right on shore, fishing.  We took in a portable graph which was very helpful.  While driving around the lake we spotted some deep spots which ran from 60-80' and it seemed a natural for whitefish but there was no mention of them anywhere so we didn't try for any.  Wouldn't you know it, the last day of fishing I caught a whitefish in 10 FOW dragging a worm across bottom.  It fought like crazy and of course we thought it was a pike.  It wasn't until we got it to the boat we saw what it was.  A nice surprise! I would recommend this lake to anyone interested in targeting pickerel (ok, walleye if you want) and pike.  When you are in the right spot and the fish are on it is just one after another and frequent double headers. A couple of things.  We noticed only one boat had a front backrest. One boat didn't have one and the other boat had a broken one.  You will want the backrest if you are fishing all day, hope it gets fixed or replaced.  The choke on all the motors was either disabled or broken.  I couldn't get the motor to start unless I pulled the cover and manually increases the throttle while pulling the rope.  I eventually switched motors.  Not a big deal if you know a little about motors but might be difficult for a novice.  The generator, which the guys going out as we came in told us, had to be run on full choke the whole time.  On Wednesday, it quit altogether.  I thought they might have sent another one in when the plane was coming.  The family coming in when we were going out bought a generator and brought it in.  They were hoping to be reimbursed and I expect they would have been.  That's my only complaint. I'll post some pics and video when I get a chance. Again, thanks Mike."

794637,chris.brock,2013-06-25 08:00:00,4053,"wow, you guys really put some quality fish in the boat!  I've been to Cam/ Little Miss., although I've fished further north and paid a lot more money for a trip, Cam Lk was one of my favorite trips, thanks for the trip down memory lane  the first trip to Cam, my cousin caught a walleye just under 10 lbs on Cam (released it of course), the biggest walleye from any of our trips"
794643,solopaddler,2013-06-25 09:40:00,8605,"It's not just you, looks like a pike to me!  Thanks Chris!  Chris has been to Cam quite recently actually. He and his girl flew in there last July to clean up years of new growth for Martin and do a bit of fishing. You guys did a great job btw. Hope you don't mind me posting this Chris, but here's a ""before"" shot that Chris sent me last summer:    Regarding the large walleye your cousin caught in Cam, I saw the note he wrote about it in the cabin. It was on the underside of the bunk I slept on.  So which camp did you end up choosing for July anyway? I'll guess Muskrat?"
794644,spinnerdoc,2013-06-25 09:57:00,556,"Those lakers are awesome Mike, looks like an awesome fly in location. Thanks for sharing"

794674,Musky or Specks,2013-06-25 13:32:00,2710,Another great report Mike. A fly in for Lakers would be grand with day trips for eyes for the table. Another trip to look into.

794699,Krisco,2013-06-25 15:25:00,67," Mike, Another great report, thanks for putting that together! Looks like you guys had a great trip, can only imagine what you would have done with 7 days at your disposal.  We were up in that area the 1st week of June, fishing was fantastic but the black flies were absolutely brutal. Have never seen them that bad before, made for a long week but fun none the less.  You mentioned the mayfly hatch, we started to see belly’s full of them as the week went on depending on which end of the lake they came from as the hatch had just begun. High water levels made travel easy but lots of floating debris to contend with.  Kris"

794547,solopaddler,2013-06-24 23:33:00,8605,"In the heart of the Chapleau Game Preserve lies Little Missinaibi lake, an iconic Canadian fly in destination. A sprawling multi-armed lake of over 3600 acres and 50 miles of shoreline it's an anglers paradise. Dominated by towering cliffs, old growth pine and a plethora of ancient Indian pictographs it's a special place indeed.  Park's Fly In Fishing operates a rustic outpost on adjacent Cam lake with a trail behind it leading to a boat cache at Little Missinaibi. Cam/Little Miss was the only camp operated by Park's that I'd yet to fish. Truth be told I'd have fished Little Miss much sooner as there's two other outfitters operating camps of their own on the big lake. However they're much more expensive and in one case requires a minimum group of six to book.  The small but perfectly comfortable (and cheap) outpost on Cam lake, closed for a number of years and now reopened, presented a perfect opportunity to sample this great fishery. After talking with Martin Wearn, owner of Park's we chose a date in mid June and the stage was set.  Joining me on this adventure was my partner in crime on many a trip, Bill, and two other friends from the Hamilton area Greg and Craig.  It was to be a short trip, only 4 nights, and with an endless amount of water to cover and a perfect weather forecast on tap we were anxious to get in the air and get started.    This map clearly shows the vast amount of water we had awaiting us....      Spirits were high as we took off from the Chapleau River in an aging but well preserved Beaver aircraft and skimmed northward into the Game Preserve.               It's not a long flight, maybe 15 minutes, and in no time at all we banked and began to descend, preparing to land on Cam lake.     As mentioned the outpost is rustic, but it had a certain charm when spied for the first time. Set back from the lake in a grove of spruce with a comfortable covered porch in front to take in the view, it was all we'd hoped for and more.      After saying our goodbyes to the pilot, we quickly unloaded and unpacked, readying gear for our initial foray. There's a trail right behind the cabin that leads to a boat cache on Little Miss. Martin had flown in earlier in the spring with a work crew to clear and mark the trail, and at the same time flew in boats, motors and plenty of gas. Accomodating chap that Martin. All we had to do was carry our fishing tackle and lunch across the trail, everything else was waiting.  It didn't take long and we were packed and off down the trail, eager to fish.       It took us roughly 12 minutes give or take to traverse the trail, and our boats were soon in view.      The question now was where do we start? With so much water to cover it was a bit daunting, but we had a game plan. Simply looking at the map we were able to eliminate a vast amount of water. Being mid June and with the historically late spring we believed the fish would still be shallow. Inflowing creeks would be a key pattern, and there are dozens of those on Little Miss. In addition the substantial Missinaibi river flowed north out of the lake and appeared to be navigable for several km's before rapids halted your progress. We both felt that would be a great place to start so we made a beeline for it.  Once again our instincts proved correct as we found a huge pod of walleyes stacked on a bouldery hump on the inside bend of the river. I'd like to say we finessed them using live bait rigs and floating jig heads, but that would be a lie. These fish would've hit a beer cap. Bill slayed them on a simple Len Thompson 5 of diamonds spoon. I caught them on jigs, Husky Jerks, Williams Wablers...whatever caught my fancy.                              This short video clip shows just how crazy it was...       The balance of our short stay was spent fishing new water. We could have easily sat on a couple of prime spots and caught fish all day long, but we were drawn to explore. On the main lake itself we found concentrations of fish in several key spots: neckdown areas, warmer back bays, and either long reed points, or adjacent to banks of reeds. The key component being warmer water and mud bottoms. Why muddy bottoms? We were there at the height of the mayfly hatch and a large percentage of the fish were cruising these warm flats in search of emerging nymphs. On the main lake proper there's no doubt this hampered our success a bit, but we persevered.  In contrast to our crazy success in the outflow river, on the main lake we had to pull out all the tricks. A small chunk of worm threaded onto a slow death hook pulled behind a small bottom bouncer was lethal. Not surprising considering what the fish were feeding on.                                         As mentioned earlier there's several Indian pictograph sites on Little Missinaibi. It's not surprising to me at all that early natives held this lake in reverence. It's beauty is hard to describe.  Here's the best example that we found:                Of course no trip would be complete without a shore lunch and Little Miss has an amazing amount of picture perfect spots. One glorious sunny day all 4 of us met up, fish in tow and indulged ourselves.                        After lunch on that day we went for a tour down to the very south end of the lake. This short clip travelling through a narrows between two main lake islands shows some of the typical scenery we navigated through.           I havn't talked much about pike but we did catch a good number of them including this chunky mid 30's fish by Bill. That fish would prove to be a prelude for what was to come....       What makes this location truly stand out and something I've yet to mention, there's several other back lakes adjacent to Little Miss that are easily accessed and fished. Two in particular stand out: Elbow lake and Trump lake.  Elbow is a walleye and pike lake and is accessed via a narrow winding creek from the outflow river on Little Miss. It's easily navigable the entire way up with zero obstructions. From Elbow there's a short 200m trail into crystal clear and cold Trump lake which has lake trout.  On one of our days we planned an excursion in there, figuring we'd start with Trump then fish Elbow on the way out.  Here we are entering the narrow creek leading into Elbow lake.      It was a 5 minute boat ride up the creek and we were soon on Elbow lake. With lakers on our mind we made a beeline for the portage trail carrying our tackle across first, then motor and gas.      There were two boats cached at the end. One leaked a tiny bit, the other leaked a lot. We chose the former and were soon on our way.      Trump lake was a true gem. In sharp contrast to the shallow, warm tannin stained water we had been fishing, it was absolutely sparkling clear, clean and rocky. Just beautiful.  It took a bit of time to figure things out, but once we did we caught oodles of fish. They weren't big lakers by any means, 3lb's tops, but they fought like possessed demons and were absolutely beautiful.  Most of our fish were caught in 30-40' of water. Luhr Jensen Power Dive Minnows put a good number of fish in the boat, as did heavy bouncers and 3-way rigs with either tiny stickbaits pulled behind them or simply a 4"" Gulp minnow threaded onto a slow death hook (that was especially lethal!). We also caught a bunch of fish flatlining spoons along the shoreline, so really the fish were everywhere!                                  We fished Trump on our last full day and time was running out as the sun started to drop lower in the late afternoon. We still wanted to fish Elbow lake so we reluctantly packed out of Trump back to our boat on Elbow.  We caught a mix of pike and walleye as we worked our way down the lake having a blast in the process before IT happened.  In preparation for our trek into Trump lake we'd left all unnecessary equipment back at the landing. We weren't expecting any really large pike and large walleye are a cinch to grab anyway.  Of course Murphy's Law struck. Perhaps a large esox should have been expected, maybe even inevitable.    In any case, no cradle? No glove? No problem!!           This fish was actually heavier than anything I caught in the Attawapiskat a few weeks back. Just a remarkable fish and a great way to cap the trip!  After a bit of revival she shot away strong and fast. She's still there in Elbow growing even bigger...   We fished for a bit longer but everything was pretty anticlimactic after that. We caught a handful of chunky walleyes and released the last one in the golden glow of early evening. What Bill as a budding photographer calls the ""magic hour"".     Magic indeed.    For those that are interested I shot a short video tour of the outpost camp at Cam lake:      Speaking of Cam lake there ""is"" a substantial population of walleye and pike in there. With such a short amount of time to cover such a large amount of water Billy and I didn't fish it. We stuck to the larger water in the hopes of larger fish. The other two boys fished it for at least one full day and they had a blast catching tons of fish. I wish we could have devoted some time to it, but it'll have to wait 'till next time.  Speaking of which there will be a next time for sure. I believe that this may be Park's best outpost location, and that's saying a lot considering some of my previous trips. The sheer amount and variety of water to fish along with the added bonus of lake trout is what sets it apart. You'll never get bored at this location.  That said there is a 12-15 min trail to walk and the cabin is FAR from being the Ritz. If you can get past that then you'd probably love this place. I sure do.   Once again a big thanks go out to our hosts Martin and Jennifer Wearn of Park's Fly In Fishing. Those guys went WAY out of their way to accomodate my every need, thanks guys I'll be back!  Finally a thanks to my boat partner Bill, you're a good man. Thanks for putting up with me and letting me take the tiller for 4 straight days. And to Greg and Craig, you guys were a blast and made the trip truly memorable. We'll definitely do it again!    Hope you guys enjoy,    Cheers,   Mike                        "
