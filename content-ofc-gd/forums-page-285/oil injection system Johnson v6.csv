805325,steelhead75,2013-08-28 06:44:00,35,"i have the automatic oil injection system on my boat,  which i have never had before.  i have worries about  the system breaking down and harming  my engine .  was considering disconnecting it and mixing the fuel directly into the main tank on board ( 80 gallon) .  was wanting  some feed back on the pros and cons of this system and any good and or bad experiences you might have had with this system in the past. i have a low oil alarm and it works fine .  the other question i have is that  i want to put a kicker on the boat is it possible to T off the main fuel line for the motor or do i need to use a separate tank. my concern is that the addition might cause an air back flow from the main engine.  i was thinking that some kinda check valve  or anti back flow would take care of this.  your thoughts and experiences greatly appreciated  "

I think and is very reliable, pre 1991 had issues.There is whats called a 3 wire and a 4 wire vro, you want the 4 its the newer version. Nothing wrong with premixing just get a measuring bottle, its the way to go if your  oil injection is prone to failure. I mix now and did on my last engine but those are 2.5 litre merc v6's ,not as reliable as newer vro's"
