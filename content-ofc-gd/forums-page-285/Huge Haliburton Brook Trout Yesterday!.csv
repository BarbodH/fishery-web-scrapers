Enjoyed a couple of quiet days on some small back lakes near my property in Haliburton for some Rainbow and Specs.  Usually I find the fishing for Brookies tough this time of year and after trying gang-trolls with a worm tipped fly and various small spinners I came up empty.  That is when I switched over to the simplest type of fishing and slowed down using a slip bobber and worm!!  I fished the presentation off some rocky points and adjusted the depth of the worm so that it was approx. 15ft down. On my second cast I landed a huge 4lb Spec that ripped line away like a Pike when I set the hook on my Ultralight! The switch over to the float and worm allowed me to boat 7 specs yesterday including 2 over 3lbs. It was a good reminder to me that sometimes the simplest presentation can be the most effective as evidenced by these beauties!Be safe and Good Fish'n... Greg."
