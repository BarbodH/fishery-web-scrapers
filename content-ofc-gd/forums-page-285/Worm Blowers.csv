805187,coolwater,2013-08-27 14:55:00,43,"Does anyone know where I can buy some of these? I tried several outdoor stores online but couldn't find anything. (maybe using the wrong search terms) These are used to inflate worms for those who may not know what I'm talking about, usually in the form of a small plastic bottle with a needle attached."
805188,bigbuck,2013-08-27 15:02:00,2449,Just use a syringe. Ask your dr for one and let him know why you need it.
805189,BillM,2013-08-27 15:23:00,17367,Go to shoppers drug mart and ask the pharmacist.
805190,BFSC Kevin,2013-08-27 15:26:00,1351,I believe Lebaron sells them
805191,buick14,2013-08-27 15:28:00,741,"le baron i think ""lindy"" makes a worm blower.  theyre super cheap"
805193,ketchenany,2013-08-27 15:30:00,3229,"Use a by idle pump! Just kidding CT may have them, or if you have as small plastic bottle you can make one. Just sharpens ball inflater."
805194,coolwater,2013-08-27 15:37:00,43,Thanks for your replies. Will give LeBaron a try or the local pharmacist.
805196,OhioFisherman,2013-08-27 15:59:00,6623,"Just a note, here in the states the laws and legalities of having a syringe in your possession with out a prescription vary widely from state to state.  The lindy ones were cheap and hard to beat."
805202,Joeytier,2013-08-27 16:59:00,3990,Syringes work far nicer.
805204,Twocoda,2013-08-27 17:23:00,4130,worm blowers you buy in the sports stores have needles that are too fat and the worms eventually deflate...as suggested the hypodermic needles are far better...thinner the needle ...less likely to cause worm deflate ( i think i just made up a new condition for worms)
805205,Ralph Field,2013-08-27 17:27:00,1018, Can you get in trouble in the states if you have a Lindy inflator ?
805211,Twocoda,2013-08-27 17:53:00,4130,thats funny ...the right to bear arms but not a needle
805212,Roy,2013-08-27 17:54:00,13728,"Just put a toothpic in him,,,he'll float."
805223,NAW,2013-08-27 19:07:00,4022,I have a lindy one.  But the place I got it is no longer in business.  It worked great.  Don't use it much.  I would be very surprised if Bass Pro doesn't have them.
805224,'Kota'sDad,2013-08-27 19:08:00,7,BassPro shops - http://www.basspro.com/Lindy-Worm-Blower/product/58678/ - or go to Lindy's site and order on line.
805226,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-27 19:11:00,1022,Select pharmacies sell syringes too. The steroid freaks used to come in all the time at the ex's pharmacy to buy them.
805236,dave524,2013-08-27 21:08:00,4508,TSC would probably have them in the livestock medicine department.
805238,SirCranksalot,2013-08-27 21:09:00,3291, Strange might be a better term!
805267,OhioFisherman,2013-08-27 23:57:00,6623," No, it isn't considered drug paraphernalia, although one might wonder why a dirty syringe in a tackle box might be considered so?"
805271,Richie Razor,2013-08-28 00:11:00,536, Great tip.
805288,Canuck2fan,2013-08-28 01:13:00,1444,I got both of my lindy's at the local CTC and never have had a problem with the worm deflating... I used to use syringes but everyone would borrow it and not return the cap so it became more trouble than it was worth to carry them. I don't lend out the lindy for the same reason.
805291,SirCranksalot,2013-08-28 01:19:00,3291, Specially made worm PFDs would be the ultimate!
805305,BFSC Kevin,2013-08-28 03:39:00,1351,I was at markham Lebaron today. They have them in stock. $1 and change for one
