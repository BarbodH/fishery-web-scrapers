Between family commitments, family illnesses and winds messing with the few days left, it has been difficult getting something together, and harder getting a decent fish day together.  So this morning we got out a little later than normal and were greeted by an almost empty launch. The derby (ies) must be over.  We lost the first 4 hooks; some at the boat, some on the way. G became discouraged and passed the next fish to me to break the jinx. It worked. We ended up 6 for 13. Was a beauty day to be out on the water.     We kept a couple small  first year Chinook for the plates, and some trout for the smoker. the rest went back to play another day. Nice to finally put together the right components."

804946,spincast,2013-08-25 20:24:00,3279,"OOOh, that happened too, especially after he lost 3 in a row.  He was so mad, he pulled his hoodie up and shut er down. Then about half hour later when I said ""get the net"" he came alive.  After that it was non stop G questions."
804947,irishfield,2013-08-25 20:30:00,26272,Maybe it's just the boat... he never napped in mine!!
804955,spincast,2013-08-25 20:56:00,3279,or that you fish at more civilised times?  What was it you said about getting up at 4 or 5 am?
