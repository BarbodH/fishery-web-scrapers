The day started off with a awesome sun rise and little wind.    around 7:30 I had the first fish in the boat after a couple follows she hit. I cant wait to do the video as it was a awesome strike from out of no where she came and ate the bait    1 min after I let her go I hook into this mid 30"" class fish Teenagers as I call them    well the wife was not happy at all she did get a few follows but no takers, around 9am after I had a few more follows I get this teenage fish smack my bait    The wife is not not pleased at all she keeps casting her arse off and finnaly gets one on but to her displeasure she looses it (there will be no video of that)  It was my turn again I had a few more follows nothing big all teenagers that follow and go under the boat but this one came back and ate my bait the video is cool of it also. I will get the video up later if anyone wants to see it.    It was a great day we left the dock around 6:10 and were back to the dock a little after 10am before the heat of the day showed up. Now its nap time then back at it tonight."

804845,SlowPoke,2013-08-24 23:54:00,2984,"Well done Mike and Da.... , well just Mike I suppose. It was a small fish day today but after two, I had an epiphany and it relates to John's post about ""a lot of people would like a day of teenagers.""  I don't want to take Mike's post in a different direction so I make a post of my own and post a link here for anyone that cares lol http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=71245"
