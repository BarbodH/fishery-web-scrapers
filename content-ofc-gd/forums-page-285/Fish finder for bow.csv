805516,bigcreekdad,2013-08-29 15:17:00,546,Does anyone make a fairly inexpensive fish finder that comes with a transducer that attaches to the trolling motor?  My bow mounted Hummingbird has died after 10+ years of active duty.
805517,Raf,2013-08-29 15:20:00,3495,"i use an old eagle 320 up front.. you can get a bracket that you attach a regular transducer to which has a band that wraps around the trolling motor.  or you can go low-tech (like me) and just use regular ole elec. tape and a small piece of wood wedged between the ducer and motor to hold it at the right angle, then make a few wraps with the tape around the ducer/wood combo and motor."
