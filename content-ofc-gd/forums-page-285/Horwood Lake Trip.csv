Fishing was pretty good considering the cold front that came through on Wednesday with a hail storm.       We caught around 85 walleye/pickerel, 10 perch and 5 pike for the 2 of us that went. Nothing big with most of them around 1 to 1.5 lbs. The biggest we caught was about 2.5 lbs. The neighbors grandson(17) caught one that would go 3-3.5 lbs. The pike were all small with one better fish around 10 lbs but no picture. All the fish were caught on a jig and worm or a dropshot setup with just a worm on the hook. We did not fish hard with only about 5-6 hrs a day split between morning and night. All in all a very good trip and will likely do it again next year.      "

804873,adempsey,2013-08-25 06:02:00,1498,Always wanted to try Horwood again.  I know it should be a productive lake.   Looks like you guys did well.   That perch in the last picture looks like a big one!
804884,TJQ,2013-08-25 13:38:00,7806,Nice!!  makin me hungry...
804903,SirCranksalot,2013-08-25 17:10:00,3291,"Great fishing! So, is Horwood road accessible?"
804911,Tayzak15,2013-08-25 17:48:00,318,"Yep, one of if not my favorite lake to go to. You could get any size fishing boat in there just about. I would suggest a bowguard for a higher end/fiberglass boat though since you will need to drive at least 10-15km's down a dirt road to get to the launches."
804967,ctered,2013-08-25 21:31:00,40,I agree with Tayzak15 on the bowguard. We were lucky with a pontoon being high off the ground but you here the stones hitting the pontoons all the time. If I bring my glass boat next year I will be buying or making some sort of guard to keep all the stones from hitting my boat.
