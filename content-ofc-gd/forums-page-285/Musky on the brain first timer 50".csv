805282,Handlebarz,2013-08-28 00:49:00,3790,Thanks Davey  Yes Andrew it's a repeat of last fall I'm glad to see the years of work pay off its nice to have a plan and work it well. I'm just glad that the musky also want to eat.  One thing people fishing musky need to remember is change up things until you find out what they want. Pay attention to the little things to repeat good days.
