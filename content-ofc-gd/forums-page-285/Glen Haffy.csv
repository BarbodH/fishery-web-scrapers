804852,coolwater,2013-08-25 00:34:00,43,Just wondering if anyone has ever fished the Glen Haffy Conservation Area north of Toronto. There are trout ponds there I thought I might take the grandkids to but I have heard conflicting reports from local guys. I know there is a cost to fishing there but I was more interested in opinions of the quality of the facility and how the fishing is this time of year.  Thanks
804863,dhickey,2013-08-25 02:21:00,1038,I pass by there every morning and night on my way to and from work and I never see any one entering or leaving. I know it used to be stocked with trout from local trout farms north of there but they have shut down for about 6 years. Cant say that I have ever fished it but if its like other ponds around that area you would do well with sunfish and perch(small) maybe even the odd bass.

804890,Richie Razor,2013-08-25 14:53:00,536,"It's a great little spot, just pay entrance and an angling fee, no extra cost per pound/inch like the other pay to fish places, however there is only a two fish limit. Everything works there, worms, corn, trout dough, spinners, spoons, roe, flies, ect...... It still is a great little place with to catch trout in the middle of summer. Rather people keep trout out of here than from the creeks."
804893,Richie Razor,2013-08-25 15:39:00,536," I believe the TRCA has there own hatchery/rearing ponds specifically for their own stocking in various TRCA owned an operated areas, glen haffy, heart lake ect...."
804916,coolwater,2013-08-25 19:08:00,43,Thanks for all your replies. I might just take a chance and go there for a day. The kids will enjoy something different regardless if they catch anything.

804980,coolwater,2013-08-25 23:18:00,43,Great to hear. Makes me feel somewhat more optimistic. Thanks
804984,shimano19,2013-08-26 00:02:00,196,I used to go there all the time with my dad when I was younger. you would always go there and catch a rainbow or 2. that was a while ago though. not sure how the fishing is now but hey give it a try..let us know how you do. im curious
