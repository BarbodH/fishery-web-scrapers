I used this line for fishing below the lights on dams and it worked great for visibility. Most of the lines I have seen are clear although they advertise as clear/blue. I always used Stren or Trilene, maybe they don't make it anymore? Thanks"

805005,dhickey,2013-08-26 01:42:00,1038,I don't get it.? Why would you want a line so visible?  In my little mind if I can see it then the fish can as well? (leaders well choose what you like) I use my rod and line along with the lure/bait to tell me whats going on under water..  Don.
