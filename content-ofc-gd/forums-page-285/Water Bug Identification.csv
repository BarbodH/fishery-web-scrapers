In addition to the minnows, I trapped quite a few of these bugs as well.  Does anyone know what type of bugs these are?  Everyone was asking me, but I didn't know.  Bug 1:   Both the front and the backside    Bug 2:    Please note:  Bug 2 is not a crawfish.  I never tried fishing with them, maybe I should have.  Bill "
804765,mike rousseau,2013-08-24 15:40:00,4661,I've seen bug #1 before... But not bug #2...  Creepy...
804767,danc,2013-08-24 15:53:00,4677,I think #1 is a giant water beetle?? #2 looks to be some type of larvae. Dragonfly perhaps?

804875,strakey,2013-08-25 11:19:00,78,The first is a giant water beetle and the second from the side looks like a helagramite. If it had big pincers it is. Otherwise i think caddis fly would be it
804883,John Bacon,2013-08-25 13:35:00,3277,"If you find the first one still alive in your trap, I understand that deliver a rather painful bit."
805115,highdrifter,2013-08-26 19:53:00,2534,"First bug is Giant Water Bug.  It is not a beetle.  A beetle is from the order of coleoptera.  That bug is a ""true bug"" and is of the order of Hemiptera. Second bug is NOT a caddis.  The proportions and rostrum tell me that this is in fact a diving beetle larvae.  Both are predators and are piscivorous, meaning that they eat fish.  cheers HD"
805116,Spiel,2013-08-26 20:02:00,9065," I'm pretty certain that HD has nailed it, no question!"
805163,Joeytier,2013-08-27 03:02:00,3990,"Cool...shoulda fried em up!  Giant water bugs are a delicacy in some eastern cultures.  For me, more likely to induce vomiting."
