They obviously aren't the highest quality, but the reels and their drags seem surprisingly decent for such a low price and would be excellent for the kids and panfish.  On clearance for $8.90 per combo...you can get 3 combo's for the price of 1 at regular price!"

But hopefully will last a few summers till the kids grow up a bit and need better !!!!but it really is bad, bad quality crap for sure for qnything else !!!! Kids will enjoy them with a bobber hook & worm ...."
