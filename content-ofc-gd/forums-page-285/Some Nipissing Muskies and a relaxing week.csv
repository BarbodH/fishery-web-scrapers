805219,mistyriver1,2013-08-27 18:35:00,600,"Hi all. Haven't posted a report in a while so I thought I'd share a few pics from my trip a couple of weeks ago from Nipissing. A very relaxing week, got to fish with my buddy Lew one morning and spent some great time on the water. Muskies were cooperating quite well and got a bonus pike fish fry. I'll let the pics do the rest of the talking.... View from the cottage and the boat's parking spot... A nice fat 49 and a half incher.... Another chunky fish...46 incher... Nice to see different sizes being caught..my son's first of the week...  My new wall paper for my phone...my two boys and a healthy 43 incher.... and of course some scenery shots.... and the end of the week pike fish fry... I havent figured out the new (to me at least) formatting but thanks for reading. Jim"

805293,mistyriver1,2013-08-28 01:47:00,600,"Thanks for the replies everyone !  Phil- it was great seeing you and PJ again, wish you guys could have stayed longer.  Believer aka Jason-  I'll let you post that pic and make sure you put a disclaimer on it that it is not me LOL  Thanks Joey, sorry we missed you guys this year.  Drew - appreciate the comment, I will try and get some more reports up again.  Roy- its my favorite lake to fish for sure.  Some good karma in that boat, I think the previous owner may have passed it on to me ; )  Rich- there's a 50 incher up there waiting for ya, I have a feeling.  Ned - Missed you up there as well.  Hope all is well.  Mike - you'll be seeing us for sure and Ben has already said he wants to come down this year."

805341,Believer,2013-08-28 13:00:00,40,"lol, i'll let you guys be the judge if it looks like Jim or not."
805342,mistyriver1,2013-08-28 13:05:00,600,"HAHAHAHAHA  The sad thing is though that even though that gentleman is a tad more ""portly"" than me, he does bear a resemblance."
