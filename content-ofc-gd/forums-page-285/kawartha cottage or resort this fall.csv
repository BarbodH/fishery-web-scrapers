805251,scugpg,2013-08-27 22:21:00,1373,I'm looking for a private cottage or resort to stay at for a few days in the kawarthas area this fall and am looking for suggestions.  looking to fish mostly muskie and walleye and maybe some bass. prefer a private quiet spot instead of large resort etc. Any suggestions welcome.  Thanks

My favorite week to take off historically was next week and I'm on a somewhat busy portion of G Bay.  Almost like a ghost town after Monday..... I'm confident where ever u rent should be peaceful.   Hopefully the fish will cooperate for you.  Good luck!"
