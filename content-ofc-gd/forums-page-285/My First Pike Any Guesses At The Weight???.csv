804210,HyperActive,2013-08-21 01:49:00,56,"This is my first pike ever, I have never fished for them but this guy bit on a top water Rapala when I was fishing for bass today.  The fight was amazing, it was almost getting to the point where I was going to start yelling and ask a stranger to run to my van and grab the net I forgot and help me land him. I have 8 lbs line on and was getting worried it was going to snap.  This fish made my day ten times over!!!  Any guesses on the weight?  Thank you for looking!!!  "
804214,Terry,2013-08-21 01:55:00,14456,"you are better off not knowing the weight , just enjoy catching a fish  that gave you a good fight and lots of fun and a   personal best"
804218,Richie Razor,2013-08-21 02:35:00,536,No more than 5lbs. Nice pike!
804219,Freshtrax,2013-08-21 02:42:00,2215,"I would say around 7 or so,  congrats  on the toothy critter"
804220,HyperActive,2013-08-21 02:45:00,56,"I just had a positive brain wave and checked to see if there was a chart on line.  He measures 30', the two charts I viewed said he should weigh 7.5 lbs. I know he may not be the fattest but I am happy knowing he weighs between 5 and 7 pounds. I honestly thought he weighed more but this is a good gauge just for the sake of knowing."
804221,BillM,2013-08-21 02:45:00,17367,5lbs or so?
804233,vance,2013-08-21 03:28:00,719,"Its not how big it is but how much fun you had, 5-10-15 20-30 lbs there is not much difference its the thrill of it,and watching your hand shaking from the adrenalin rush afterwards and feeling your heart pounding is what fishing is all about.  vance"
804237,irishfield,2013-08-21 03:34:00,26272,I'm with Terry... who cares.. but if I had to put a weight on it I'd say 4 to 5 lbs. Takes a lot to put weight on a pike.
804256,Rich,2013-08-21 10:45:00,3927,Nice first pike to introduce you to the species!  Who cares about weight? Pike are measured in inches.
804294,mercman,2013-08-21 15:42:00,7054,Really nice fish !! Pike are a great first step towards Musky. ;-)
804302,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2013-08-21 16:22:00,535,"Don't listen to him! Stay far away from musky, unless you enjoy spending thousands of dollars....  Nice pike! It was just a few years ago I caught my first pike, I still remember what a thrill it was."
804482,adolson,2013-08-22 18:02:00,783,"That's definitely a nice first pike. I wouldn't start targetting them now, though... They're not all like that. At least not up where I live.  My biggest was 35"" (in a trout lake), but most of the time I get smaller ones, and even tiny ones like this:    Mind you, that's only when I'm forced to fish in a lake without any trout in it."
804483,northernpike56,2013-08-22 18:15:00,717,"+1 for size not mattering. Its a nice fish though for sure, first fish are always so cool to catch too. For me, I just have lake trout and musky left to catch, and I get excited even just fishing a lake that has them in it."
804485,bubbles,2013-08-22 18:31:00,591, As are other things in life........
804515,Rizzo,2013-08-22 22:24:00,4754,"thats a decent pike, has graduated from hammerhandle or snotrocket status so I'd say 5 or 6 pounds. Pretty good for a first one, there are plenty of smaller ones out there waiting to bite-off your bass lures"
804529,Fisherpete,2013-08-22 23:20:00,1814,"At 30"" it should be between 5 and 7 pounds or so. Most of mine in that size are around 6. I still remember my first vividly - was bass fishing on Simcoe when a 34"" 8.5lber destroyed my spinnerbait. That fish planted the seed to the esox fever that is with me to this day!"
805313,Twocoda,2013-08-28 05:00:00,4130,Ill give ya 4 to 5 pounds...and you can add the fisherman's tax to its weight...Nice shootin even though you missed your target
