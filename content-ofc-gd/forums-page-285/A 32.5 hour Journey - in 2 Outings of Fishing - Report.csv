804469,Leecher,2013-08-22 16:51:00,7832," Thanks Drew!!!  That laker was the first fish of the day... 5 - 10 min work out after arriving on the spot and it was FISH ON!!!  Gave me a great fight   bull dogging, gator roll and drag peeling was some of the highlights in this 15 min fight    Good thing I had spooled my reel with 14LBS mono the night before and Paul brought his Frabril musky size net    Couldn't imagine using my regular one I have for this brute.   Thanks Eric!!!  You bet   Thanks Roy!!!  Both days the wind was constant and had a good chop   Thanks Rick!!!   It was indeed a super time   Thanks Mike!!!   Thanks Frankie!!! 40 - 50 bass day of all sizes was what we experienced   Thanks Will!!!"
