804507,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-22 21:23:00,4399,"Just wondering what others have done, the manual says a shoot thru the hull method MAY diminish the returns on the down imaging side of the sonar.  I felt on my old fish finder that the shoot thru method affected the sonar returns, never gave accurate reading especially at speed. I am a little skittish about drilling into my fibreglass but I am thinking if I want the full benefit of down imaging then a transom mounted ducer is the way to go. The boat is Stratos 176XT wondering what other glass boat owners thoughts are on the install.  Thanks"
804508,Terry,2013-08-22 21:42:00,14456,"glue a good size piece of nylon or puck-board to your transom and screw the transducer to that, no holes in the fiberglass"
804510,aplumma,2013-08-22 21:48:00,6896,Down imaging needs to be on the back of the boat in the water shooting thru the hull gives poor returns. The puck board is the way to go.   Art
804512,irishfield,2013-08-22 22:00:00,26272,What glue did you use Terry.. it will be the next question !
804517,DRIFTER_016,2013-08-22 22:39:00,10439,I actually screwed my UHMW to the back of my boat. Sealed the screws with 3M 5200 marine sealant. I also ran a bead around the back side of the board including running around the screw holes before installing. It will never leak and lord help me if it ever needs to be removed.
804573,fishindevil,2013-08-23 08:21:00,6254,See the nylon on both sides marine silicone and screwed in !!!! So it's drill a few holes once and never again as I can change or add transducers and never have to drill anymore holes been working fine for 6yrs no leaks nothing !!!!! Or just silicone the nylon board it will hold no problems !!! Cheers

804598,mattp33,2013-08-23 13:19:00,290,I did a thru hull on my HDS skimmer ducer.  seems to work ok at speeds.  If I did it again I would use silicone instead of marine epoxy.  I think if I did do it again I would wet mount it actually.  If you have a structure scan it will NEED to be wet mounted

804629,JoshS,2013-08-23 17:43:00,729,"Anyone know where you can you pick up Nylon or puck board? Was out looking for it last week with no luck.... Heard starboard polysheets work well too., looks like the same stuff.  Are you guys securing the board with 3M 5200?"
804635,Bill Shearer,2013-08-23 17:59:00,456,"UHMW can be found at Lee Valley  http://www.leevalley.com/en/hardware/page.aspx?p=32045&cat=3,43576,32045"
804640,fishindevil,2013-08-23 18:32:00,6254,yes secure it with 3M 5200 !!!!  yes works awesome...
804641,fishindevil,2013-08-23 18:33:00,6254,marine silicone...
804643,JoshS,2013-08-23 18:52:00,729,"Awesome, thanks."
805304,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-28 03:03:00,4399,Install is done used the the puck board as suggested...can't wait to get the boat in the water and check out down imaging.
