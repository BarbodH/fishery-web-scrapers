The best part was I spent 30 minutes chasing this guy and changed baits 4 or 5 times going down the shore line.  He kept coming out for a peak but would not go away, just went from cover to cover.  Never seen anything like it before. The best part was how clean and healthy he looked, not a mark or scare."
