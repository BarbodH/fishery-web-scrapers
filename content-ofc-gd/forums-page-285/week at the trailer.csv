That put him atop the leader board for kids at the trailer park for the season so far, He was also leading last year until the last weekend but lost out... took some time out to get a pic or to of the local wildlifeThis little watersnake was sneaking up on the Bullfrog but decided against it (their brains do function! LOL) I got mine on Saturday afternoon 3lb 6oz smallie, got beaten by the boy again! jjcanoe"

805299,Rod Caster,2013-08-28 02:19:00,5784,Nice weekend. you should have caught and eaten both the frog and snake therefore establishing yourself as #1 predator haha.
