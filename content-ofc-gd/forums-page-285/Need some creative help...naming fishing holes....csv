804776,mike rousseau,2013-08-24 16:11:00,4661,So I'm running out of names for new fishing spots I'm finding... My fishing journal is getting confusing.... Lol  So I was wondering if you guys would post up some names for spots like... points... Banks... Rocks/stones.... Ripples... Etc...  In all seriousness I will be using a lot of these names....  I'm just not a super creative person....  Thanks...
804780,Dave Bailey,2013-08-24 16:28:00,1641,"Name some for the common wildflowers around them, like 'Aster Bay',  'Trillium Creek', etc. Just stay away from 'Poison Ivy Pond'."
804781,Muskieman,2013-08-24 16:36:00,2472,"Bikini Bay , Snag Pile , Stump Dump , Split Lip, Steven Seagull , Prop Rock , Li'l Dinks ... or how about naming your spots after OFC member names ?"
804783,mike rousseau,2013-08-24 16:37:00,4661,"That's not a bad idea...  ""Mercman's mud flat""  Lol"
804797,lew,2013-08-24 17:20:00,12766,..
804806,Roy,2013-08-24 18:30:00,13728,Name them the date you first fished or discovered them?
804807,Roy,2013-08-24 18:33:00,13728, Yeah sure...then all his LM Bass spots will be called Roy.
804812,irishfield,2013-08-24 19:37:00,26272,Waypoint 134.. 135... 136... 137 My lowrance don't give me names...
804822,mike rousseau,2013-08-24 20:38:00,4661, Lmao.....
804823,mike rousseau,2013-08-24 20:44:00,4661,"Thought about that...  With 300+ waypoints I think that would be confusing looking back years later at info....  ... Well 3 years ago when the water was 66 degrees we caught fish at waypoint 112... 228... And 301.... Where's that?.... Lemme check my GPS....  Most spots I try to name them based on something I can remember... For example... I have a spot I call ""The dead cow""... Because its the closest spot I fish to the dead cow I found this spring..."
804834,manitoubass2,2013-08-24 22:52:00,11391,"I actually keep journals for lakes lol. I make notes on water temp, structure species etc. so my way points are easily found in my journal"
804836,manitoubass2,2013-08-24 22:55:00,11391,"The lakes are easy, it's rivers that are tough. Rainy river for example, for years we had a sandbar off a point that was deadly for walleye pre and post spawn. 2 years later and it's all rock now. The river is constantly changing. I find water levels to be the most confusing to figure out year to year"
804886,SirCranksalot,2013-08-25 14:02:00,3291,Tell me where they are and I'll dream up some suitable names for you!!
804889,Rich,2013-08-25 14:43:00,3927,"I have fun naming all the coves and structure in the ponds out back. Makes for easy reference points as to where I caught a fish. I dunno what I'd do if I got to 300 waypoints though, lol grab a dictionary and pick random words!"
804891,Musky or Specks,2013-08-25 15:20:00,2710,"I generally name my spots after people Ive fished them with or something unique that happened there. Banana Hole,Robbies Run, Power Grub riffle etc."
804961,Garnet,2013-08-25 21:19:00,2056,"Lets see I have  hill, Gay Bay, and Ken's Is. Yes they all have stories."
804963,danc,2013-08-25 21:29:00,4677,"As long as nobody else on the planet knows where Chipmunk Cove, Butt's Bay and Sauna Rock Shoal are, I'll be happy. Just a few of the creative names that my Buds and I have made up."
804969,kickingfrog,2013-08-25 21:48:00,8333,"Does it makes sense to you to try to have a formula for spots? Species, bottom type etc?"
804971,dave524,2013-08-25 22:19:00,4508,I'd just call them waypoint 123 etc. as time passes they should earn their own nicknames based on your experiences good or bad.
805071,mercman,2013-08-26 14:59:00,7054,That would be way cool !!! Just stay away from Mercs Rockpile.
805083,mike rousseau,2013-08-26 16:09:00,4661,"That one is ""half throttle hell"".... Lmao"
805553,Fisherpete,2013-08-29 19:32:00,1814,"If ""banana hole"" has a story - please don't share it here as this forum is family friendly!!!"
