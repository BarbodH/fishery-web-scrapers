779190,lew,2013-04-12 10:17:00,12766," Have to disagree with you on that one Shayne, I get alot of  muskies trolling and it hardly cost me anything to rig my boat up the way I wanted it. Little bit of ingenuity and some elbow grease and your all set.  The custom track set-ups are nice, but definitely not required."
779191,Roy,2013-04-12 10:42:00,13728,I don't use tracks. These are all I use and they work just fine for me.   
779194,lew,2013-04-12 10:48:00,12766,"That's a nice setup Roy and funny thing is, I was putzing around on GOOGLE awile ago looking at Downeast setups and that picture came up along with the post you made about it on OFC back in 2009."
779195,Roy,2013-04-12 10:53:00,13728,hahaha  You can run but you can't hide. Uncle Buck made the bases for me....they're indestructible.
779200,lew,2013-04-12 11:08:00,12766, No safe havens in the modern world Roy LOL
779202,Rizzo,2013-04-12 11:43:00,4754,"So would those mounts just be screwed in (is that strong enough?) or would they be bolted through to the other side? And if bolted, what's on the other side (ie just some big washers or another big aluminum plate?)"
779209,Roy,2013-04-12 12:15:00,13728,Aluminum plates on both sides. Large washers would do fine though.
779212,Lunkerhunter,2013-04-12 12:35:00,455,i have trojan tackle rod holders and absolutely love them! dave does an awesome job and they are built like tanks.
779222,Lunkerhunter,2013-04-12 13:41:00,455,here are a couple pictures of the trojans i put on my boat.  dave put together 2 mounts that go on to my walker downrigger plates and he did one with a riser on the back deck for a prop wash rod.  the prop wash rod holder is not in the pics.    
779250,Pigeontroller,2013-04-12 15:18:00,2793,My Trojan Riser & Salty      Seat post & Scotty Powerlock plus Scotty extension   
779283,Crazy Ivan,2013-04-12 18:21:00,184,Nice set-up Roy. I run the same kind of mount as that and it works fine.  Also noticed the Brug. Nice.
779301,Sinker,2013-04-12 19:25:00,8692,"No, the tracks aren't ""required"", bbut they sure make things easy to remove for storage, transport, of if you want to take the kids tubing etc.  I don't think the alumacraft has rails either, but they do have some sort of system for mounting accessories.  S."
779311,trapshooter,2013-04-12 20:08:00,1234,"Track systems are awesome, I have Bert's on my boat with salty holders.  Bullet proof.  "
779328,irishfield,2013-04-12 21:24:00,26272,"Here's the nice thing with tracks.. when it's time to slap the tight trailering cover on and go...    Or maybe you want to have ""shore"" lunch on the boat!  "
779330,Sinker,2013-04-12 21:25:00,8692,Exactly! The only way to go if your installing rod holders on a boat IMO. Sooooo many options once the tracks are installed!  S.
804975,scugpg,2013-08-25 22:43:00,1373,for smaller boats 14-16ft would the regular down easter rod clamp to most gunwales or would the salty be a better choice?
804982,Sinker,2013-08-25 23:35:00,8692,"They'll both clamp on no problem, but the salty's are the way to go. Buy them once and be done.  S."
779086,Rizzo,2013-04-11 22:58:00,4754,"Never had rod holders in a boat, but now that I'll be trolling a lot more I want to get some holders mounted. My buddy mentionned something about Bert's?? but don't know what this is. I have one down easter (clamp on) that I bought years ago and then never used. I'd be looking to have 2 rod holders mounted on each side for a total of 4. I troll at breakneck speed so something SOLID is a must. Please provide suggestions, and if you have em, a photo of your set up! Thanks."
779087,mike rousseau,2013-04-11 22:59:00,4661,Does your clamp on fit on your boat..???  I'm assuming yes....  Just get 3 more...  Burt's systems are more for boats that cannot clamp on
779090,Raf,2013-04-11 23:02:00,3495,downeasters are the gold standard when it comes to muskie fishn.
779093,Rizzo,2013-04-11 23:08:00,4754,"haven't checked if the clamp on fits, as I just left a deposit on the boat today. Won't these clamp on do some serious damage to paint jobs? Maybe I don't understand where they clamp?"
779097,Raf,2013-04-11 23:20:00,3495,"you can put a small piece towel/tshirt around the clamping point.  alternately, you can get more permament downeaster solutions [ie. non-clamp on models that require mounting points."
779099,Rizzo,2013-04-11 23:27:00,4754,I think the mounted version might be best. Do they mount right on the top of the gunnel? If I recall correctly the gunnel is around 3 inches wide.
779100,farsider,2013-04-11 23:28:00,456,"Go with Trojan Tackle.   Just get a riser for your salty and get three more setups.  Cdn. made and a big Musky supporter runs the business.  http://trojantackle.ca/holders.htm  He sells tracks and all the accessories and will custom make something for you to exactly fit your needs if he doesn't already offer it.  Cheers, Mark"
779101,Nipfisher,2013-04-11 23:29:00,2449,If you are installing on a new boat go with the Traxstech (http://traxstech.com/) system or a rail system like Trojan Tackle. More options with less holes.  Farsider beat me to it.
779103,Raf,2013-04-11 23:32:00,3495,"have a look at http://trojantackle.ca/ for ideas  the 'mounted' ones are 'permament' in the sense that they are not quick and easy to remove.  so you may want to look at either the rail or clamp style attached to a mounting point/rail which is attached to your gunnel.  if your gunnels are in fact 3"" then you will not be able to clamp the clamp-on style directly to them."
779106,lew,2013-04-11 23:38:00,12766,"If you've got rails, that makes a great mounting spot Roger      Or you can even make your own like this one I use to run baits right in the propwash    "
779107,captpierre,2013-04-11 23:40:00,2521,I use 2 Scotty Orcas and am well satisfied.  Just can't angle them too far down  peter
779109,Nipfisher,2013-04-11 23:43:00,2449,I love the prop wash mount Lew. I remember seeing the post when you made it. Gonna have to find it again.
779110,lew,2013-04-11 23:45:00,12766," And it works really good too, I'm very happy with it.  I can put the bait anywhere I want around the prop or even directly behind it."
779111,Rizzo,2013-04-11 23:46:00,4754,Hew Lew..are those clamp on ones that just clamp to the rails? I don't have rails currently but it couldn't be too costly to get a couple rails on (could it?).
779114,Rizzo,2013-04-11 23:50:00,4754,"just checked the down easter on my current boat, it barely fits over that gunnel . No way will I be able to clamp on the alumacraft (at least not with that holder). Will need something with a wider gap"
779116,lew,2013-04-11 23:53:00,12766, Those particular clamps are made specifically for the rails Roger although I don't recall the model...maybe S-10 ??  Here's another holder I fashioned out of a solid aluminum tow bar. I made it so it sits right down inside the rear seat post hole and allows you to put the bait anywhere around the transom.  
779117,Rizzo,2013-04-12 00:00:00,4754,nice Lew! How did you get the right diameter post to fit down inside the seat mount? You must know someone with access to the right equipment!
779120,lew,2013-04-12 00:15:00,12766, Lotsa time with a fine tooth file Roger

779126,Pigeontroller,2013-04-12 00:29:00,2793,If you're coming to the Odyssey Saturday talk to Dave at the Trojan Tackle booth...He'll have some excellent display models there.
779129,irishfield,2013-04-12 00:38:00,26272,Roger... spend a bit of coin and do it right the first time. Put Traxstech (was Pursuit) or Bert's rails on if you have enough gunnel width. Then you can buy accessories as you go along and switch up for any species in less than 5 minutes!      
779155,F7Firecat,2013-04-12 02:30:00,347,"Dave Dutchak, Trojan Tackle nuff said!"
779158,Moosebunk,2013-04-12 02:39:00,3970,Hey.. for a different reason this pic just got posted in the other thread. lol.  Easy copy and paste.     Again... always fun tweakin' yer rig to suit your fishing.
779164,Sinker,2013-04-12 03:01:00,8692,"Yep, you gotta put tracks on that new boat fer sure! They're costly, but your wasting your $$ any other way!  Berts or trojan.  S."
779189,SlowPoke,2013-04-12 10:00:00,2984,Dont spend a dime until its in your driveway. Alumacraft has a new track/rail system similar to Lund but I dont know if the '12 models had it. Rear seats (flip or pedestal) and travel/storage covers may dictate mounting options.
