The night before we left I spread all the important stuff on the garage floor just to make sure I was not forgetting anything, nothing worse than working your tail off to get to lake X and discovering that you forgot your favorite/go too lure at home. I'm sure we have all been there before.     A couple pictures at the trail head after the bikes are ""loaded"" up and a pic of the gang along a good part of the trail       This time of the year we find the lake trout fairly deep (50-70ft) so the jigs are tied on , finders are juiced up and away we go . First drift through the bay we started to nail them .This one was caught on the first drop of the jig .    The afternoon went on and the fishing was great with us boating around 15 lake trout and a couple smallies. The next morning the lake trout were off a bit but the smallmouth were on fire just off a point in about 20ft of water in front of an old hunt camp , This was one of the biggest I caught that morning.    That night we had a lake trout shore lunch at camp , here is a pic. of my friend cleaning them up at camp.    The next day started well with a couple nice lake trout but the lake trout bite tailed off quick and we resorted to the smallmouth .    When we were fishing for the smallies up on the point we discovered that the lake trout were there as well in 15-25ft of water and surprisingly hitting our crayfish jigs . We caught around 10 lake trout this way , pretty crazy if you ask me . This was the bait/baits I was catching the lakers on that morning      It was a great trip and I can't wait for the next one in September , hope you enjoyed !   "
804901,Rod Caster,2013-08-25 17:06:00,5784,That looks like a really fun trip. I'd love to do a four wheeling backlake trip... never did one before.  Good tip/pattern for the shallower lakers. Everything eats crayfish I guess.
805029,fishindevil,2013-08-26 08:06:00,6254,Some very nice trout you guys got !!!!! Great pics too looks like a cool spot to go camp and get some shore lunch !!!  Nice smallie as well !!!!! Cheers
805041,TroutnMuskieHunter,2013-08-26 12:00:00,1362,Looks like a great spot to relax and have some good times with the boys!...nice Lakers.
805046,BillM,2013-08-26 12:19:00,17367,Nice man!  Don't lay love when those crayfish come up missing both claws?  LOL!!!
805138,Sinker,2013-08-26 22:26:00,8692,"Good stuff! Those are some nice trout! I've caught them on crayfish patterns before too. Pretty neat, eh?  S."
805145,Joeytier,2013-08-26 23:46:00,3990,Good stuff as always.  You've got the vertical jigging game figured out big time for the big lakers.
805175,wormdunker,2013-08-27 10:35:00,1711,Nice lakers & always fun to get the smallies too!
805254,Moosebunk,2013-08-27 22:28:00,3970,4X4'in and gettin' 'er done in the back bush.  Can't complain one little bit about those great smallie and laker results.  Good fishing.
805265,solopaddler,2013-08-27 23:51:00,8605,"Nice report, and definitely a unique way to catch those lakers!"
805506,4x4bassin,2013-08-29 14:24:00,1025,"Thanks for the comments guys , it sure was strange catching smallmouth and lake trout in 20 ft of water on the same small point and the same crawfish jig in the middle of August . I guess you just never know ! I am going back to the same lake in September and I will be going back to that point with a crawfish jig tied on for sure"
