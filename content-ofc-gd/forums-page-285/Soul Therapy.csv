804632,MJL,2013-08-23 17:45:00,2427,"As many of you know, back in February, I was diagnosed with cancer for a 2nd time in 2.5yrs. For 3 months I underwent one of the more intensive chemotherapy regimens available. Things didn’t go as smoothly as I had hoped and my treatment took longer than originally planned; anaphylaxis was one of the bigger issues.  By the end of it all, I was beaten and broken down. Throughout my treatment, I kept my eyes on what I wanted to do and the places I wanted to visit when it finished.  Have I accomplished what I wanted to do? Not even close  Am I having fun doing what I love to do, whenever I can do it? Absolutely.  The last 2 months I’ve been able to get out onto the water a few times to enjoy some Soul-therapy. There are very few things I enjoy doing more than my fishing & photography. My dad and friends helped drive me to the rivers and carry some of my gear down to the bank. Here are some pics that I took:  Carp    The release     Big Shoulders        Redhorse  According to a redhorse ID chart I found on Google, it looks like a silver redhorse. I caught a few with worms. They do fight well.      Sheepshead         Channel Catfish       White Bass           Mystery Gar  According to the fish ID experts that were contacted, it’s either a rare spotted gar or a Florida gar that someone released from an aquarium. Either case, it’s a neat catch.      One day I'd love to get underwater pictures of all the 154 species of freshwater fish in Ontario. In reality I probably won't get them all but I'd like to photograph as many as I can and have fun trying. Maybe in 20-30yrs I'll write a coffee table book.LOL  If there’s one thing I learned during this stint of chemo and watching streaming movies online while in quarantine, it’s rule #32 from Zombieland: “Enjoy the little things”  Cheers  Mike "
804633,irishfield,2013-08-23 17:55:00,26272,Glad you're getting in some fun Mike! Not many deserve such outings as you do !  Great underwater shots... you should do a book!
804634,msp,2013-08-23 17:55:00,1336,Great post MJL. Hope all is well on your end. Excellent photo skills too !  I too live by some Zombieland rules........  # 8 - Get a kick a$$ partner # 14- Always carry a change of underwear  Take care of yourself dude
804657,Dozer,2013-08-23 19:50:00,896,"Very cool dude, amazing shots - question for ya - are you shooting with a DSLR?  Underwater housing? Bag?"
804663,misfish,2013-08-23 20:04:00,29133,Sweet under water shot dude. I remember that redhorse you caught at the tressel. That was a pig. Nice to see you getting out  Maybe you can get up for a fall  morning steelhead fish.  Take care Mike.
804665,Bill Shearer,2013-08-23 20:13:00,456,Seriously good photos! Hope your convalescing continues to progress well.
804675,Locnar,2013-08-23 21:15:00,645,"Awesome photos, and some real nice fish to boot. That's a cool variety, was that all in one spot? Show the big C who's boss and kick its arse man! Hopefully things go well."
804682,timmeh,2013-08-23 21:51:00,609,"Best of luck with your battle, great to see you're getting out a bit. Great photos as always, can't wait to see some underwater trout photos this fall or next spring."
804686,MCTFisher9120,2013-08-23 22:00:00,3761,"Nice pictures and catches. I played around with underwater photo's/video with my Fuji camera, need to do more of it next time I'm out. Love underwater images.  Thanks for sharing,  MTBF"
804693,Rod Caster,2013-08-23 22:21:00,5784,Hope things only get better from here.  Man those photos are sweet. A lot of species we dont often see photographed.
804696,spincast,2013-08-23 22:37:00,3279,"Fantastic photos, and what a way to fight back."
804697,danc,2013-08-23 22:37:00,4677,Beautiful work Mike. I'd love to spend a couple days with you up here some time. Get yourself better Bud.

804745,spinnerdoc,2013-08-24 09:48:00,556,I've always admired your spirit Mike. Nothing ever dampens it. Best of luck in your recovery from chemo. And those are as usual stunning pics.

804772,Beans,2013-08-24 16:01:00,3339,Awesome shots Mike...I'm glad to hear you are getting out and about...  Your soul therapy is the same as my mental health therapy...  Anybody you know ???    
804774,Twocoda,2013-08-24 16:05:00,4130,Put me down for a autographed book because im not going to stand in a line at Chapters to get your signature on your book tour...Great shots Mike! Positive thoughts for victory!
804799,pics,2013-08-24 17:39:00,1268,"WOW, beautiful photos!!! Keep fighting the good fight!!"
804814,NAW,2013-08-24 19:44:00,4022,Amazing photos man!  Keep em coming!!!
804819,MJL,2013-08-24 20:35:00,2427,"Thanks guys for the comments. Glad you liked the pics. It really means a lot   Thanks MSP. I also live by Rule #31 - Check the backseat...I don't want anyone stealing my custom float rods    Thanks Dozer. I am shooting with a DSLR setup: - Canon 7D - Canon 8-15mm f/4L - Aquatech sport housing & dome port    I have used EWA Marine baggies in the past and the pics came out great and it was super easy to travel with. I would however not recommend them for use in sub-zero temps – The seams become brittle and fail.    Brian, I’m definitely making my way up to your neck of the woods this fall. I totally missed out on the spring steelhead/trout season this year.    Thanks Locnar. All but 1 of the pictures were taken from the same river. The fishing hasn’t been all that great for me this season numbers-wise (compared to what I normally average) but I guess it’s a good thing as I spend my time recovering    Thanks Mike. Do you still work at the shop? I may need to pop in for your advice on lures for bass next time I'm in the area   Dan, it's one of my dreams to come up to your neighbourhood and fish with you     We need to hook up again...It's been too long  And that was me 8lbs lighter than I am now.LOL  Thanks again guys"
804870,Joey,2013-08-25 03:10:00,9122,Those photos are impressive!!!   I'm glad you are getting a chance to do what you love and are kicking cancer's butt back!!!   Awesome stuff Mike!!!  Stay healthy bud!
804906,ehg,2013-08-25 17:26:00,2666,"Those are incredible photos! You have mad skillz!  That is probably a rare spotted gar. Found in couple spots Lake Erie shore/marsh  or eastern Lake Ontario shore/marsh.  Sad to see you battling the health issues, you will win out.  All the best!  ."
804910,misfish,2013-08-25 17:48:00,29133," Be sure to let me know when. I,ll be your bouro sp? (carrying guy) LOL"
804912,BillM,2013-08-25 17:53:00,17367,"Mike every time you post those underwater pics it makes me want to break out the credit card!  Absolutely amazing man    I've got a EWA marine baggie as well, I gotta see if I can jam my 10-22mm in there."
