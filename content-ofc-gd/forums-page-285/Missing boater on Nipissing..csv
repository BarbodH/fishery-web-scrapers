805097,Twocoda,2013-08-26 18:00:00,4130,smaller lakes have a tendency to have tighter waves (closer together) ...this is what causes so many problems...there isnt a bilge pump in the world that will keep up to a boat being swamped by a wave....but if someone reads this and it gets imbedded into their mind...it just may serve its purpose  Very sad for the family

805119,Old Ironmaker,2013-08-26 20:09:00,8243,"Very sad, deepest condolences. The man was from NB. I'm sure he was experienced. Which sometimes isn't enough.<br /><br />Over 30 years ago 5 men from the same family lost their lives on the south shore west of Calendar. All experienced boaters that played the wrong card. Sad, unfortunately it will happen again.<br /><br />I was safety checked recently by an OPP boat on Erie, they told me they found that same day 2 idiots in a canoe, no life jackets and 1 paddle drifting 5 miles from shore off of Nanticoke In the shipping lane!"
805300,Rod Caster,2013-08-28 02:25:00,5784,"Very sad and my heart goes out to the family  From what I understand, they were netting with new gear and the combination of weight (from fish and new nets) and weather was too much for their small boat. The man was wearing a lifejacket at the time but the waves were likely too powerful.  Very sad; they are good people from a good family too."
