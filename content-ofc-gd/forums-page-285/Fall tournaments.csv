Any information would be great. I have been hunting online and am only really coming across circuits and the larger tournaments.. the smaller ones seem to have dead links and phone numbers that don't work.  Thanks in advance! Cheers, Jb"

805067,JFish,2013-08-26 14:39:00,29,I would also love any info regarding these smaller tourneys.  My friend and I just have a small 14ft aluminum.  Until I get my new boat we can't compete in the various bass series within Ontario.  Thanks for any info.
