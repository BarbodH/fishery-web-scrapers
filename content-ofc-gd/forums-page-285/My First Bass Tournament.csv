805401,t4runner,2013-08-28 22:07:00,37,Congrats. Sounds like you had a great time!
805420,johnnyb,2013-08-28 23:57:00,3413,I've only done a couple very unofficial tournaments for mostly bragging rights.....and I find the competition thrilling.  You guys did great out there......and looking at the first couple pics.....you had to compete against a guy in a plane?!?!?!?!
804037,ccmtcanada,2013-08-20 15:17:00,7971,"I was vacationing up at my cousin's cottage up on Paudash Lake last week.  A few days before I headed up there, he sends me a text asking if I wanted to be his partner in a Charity Bass Tournament.  I figured if the entry fee didn't bankrupt me then why not?  My cousin fishes in a local tournament circuit, so I thought it would be cool to experience it all.  This past Sunday, we headed over to the registration table and took care of business there.  A tournament official came by and checked to make sure there was a working livewell on the boat as this was a live release event.  My cousin getting things ready as we waited for the 7am blast off...   At a few minutes to 7, everyone was jockeying for position...   I received this picture from the tournament organizers...shows us just starting to get up on plane at blast off.  Pretty cool shot if you ask me!  Taken from a bridge....we are the boat on the right.   As we sped to our first spot of the day, I took my iphone out...opened a GPS app and wanted to see how fast we were going.  We topped out at 122 km/h....the fastest I've ever been in a boat!  My face and cheeks began to vibrate so I hunkered down behind the windshield.  I was also sitting on my hat as I usually do when going ""fast"", but I shifted my weight ever so slightly and I could feel the wind rip it right out from underneath me!  It flew out of the boat in between us...we laughed all the way to the first spot!  The day was tough...caught a lot of 1 to 1.5 pounders, but the big fish eluded us.  Biggest fish for us was about 3.5 pounds.  A tournament official was blasting all over the lake snapping pictures (and making sure we were following rules I assume) and he captured this ""action"" shot.   It's amazing how fast the day goes.  Concentrating on every single cast....switching up baits to see what produced and what didn't.  No time to snap pictures as it was all business.  I really did have a blast out there though!  At the end of the day, we weighed in at just under 12 pounds for our 5 fish.  We weighed in 4th (out of I think 23 boats) and there were already 2 other teams ahead of us.  We figured we'd end up middle of the pack.  To our surprise, everyone else had a tough time out there as well...and we ended up in 5th place...the last money spot.  The winnings gave us back our entry fee so that was a nice bonus! "
804044,Luke V.,2013-08-20 15:44:00,286,Way to go! Getting back the entry fee is always the goal for tournament anglers!  Congrats on a top 5 finish
804046,fishnsled,2013-08-20 16:00:00,3520,"Nicely done!!  Always nice to get your money back, doesn't happen to often for most. Nice to have the bonus pics as well, that shot from the bridge is great.  Congrats to you both!!"
804057,Headhunter,2013-08-20 16:29:00,5703,"Nice job Cliff! unfortunately for you, your cousin now knows the stigma of the Cliff stripe! LOL Might be some time before you get a second call! LMAO!  HH"
804080,chris.brock,2013-08-20 17:59:00,4053,"very cool, I bet you're looking forward to another tourney now after the thrill of that one"
804086,gordy28,2013-08-20 18:43:00,638,Very cool - good for you and probably an awesome experience Something I always wanted to try - either enter into a local tourney w my brother in our boat or go as a co angler Very cool
804107,Twocoda,2013-08-20 20:30:00,4130,120 kph = hurry up and wait...placing in the tourney is a bonus...the real reward was the experience...Congrates!
804113,lookinforwalleye,2013-08-20 20:51:00,4399,Since you cashed a check I guess that means you are a professional fisherman!!!  Congrats
804117,misfish,2013-08-20 20:57:00,29133,AWESOME Cliff. Reading that report  brought  goose bumps of my very first tourny.  Cash back is a bonus.  Well done.
804272,ccmtcanada,2013-08-21 12:29:00,7971,Thanks everyone!  It was a really cool experience that's for sure.  As far as entering more...that remains to be seen!! LOL.
804304,Beans,2013-08-21 16:35:00,3339,Breaking even at the racetrack is a good day...  Congrats on placing fifth...
804309,mike rousseau,2013-08-21 17:11:00,4661,How did you like the stress/pressure of the tournament...?  It brings a whole other feeling to your day on the water....
804320,ccmtcanada,2013-08-21 18:54:00,7971,"Mike...because it was a charity tourney with just a $100 entry fee, there wasn't a lot of ""pressure"".  I found it to be challenging to have to be concentrating 100% of the time, but it wasn't a ""chore"".   It was sort of a ""let's do our best and see how we stack up"" sort of excitement feeling if that makes sense."
804349,Handlebarz,2013-08-21 21:42:00,3790,Very nice congrats
804381,kickingfrog,2013-08-22 00:57:00,8333,So are you saying there is more pressure when you're up at Bernie's? A 120kph in a boat eh. Ye haw!
804384,Moosebunk,2013-08-22 01:07:00,3970,Good show Cliff.  Another fishing experience under your belt.
804391,ccmtcanada,2013-08-22 01:52:00,7971,Yes....because Joe is always making fun of me up there.  Lol
804398,nexstar,2013-08-22 02:33:00,63,Congratz on cashing a cheque... It must be an awesome experience.
804484,northernpike56,2013-08-22 18:18:00,717,"122 km/h is so fast, fastest I've been on a boat is around 80 km /h and that felt crazy. How many hp is the motor?"
804494,ccmtcanada,2013-08-22 19:59:00,7971,He is running a two stroke 250hp monster on the back lol. We likely burned between $80 and $100 in gas that day!
804501,kickingfrog,2013-08-22 20:33:00,8333," Hmmmmm, sounds like someone didn't chip in for fuel?"
804503,ccmtcanada,2013-08-22 21:09:00,7971,Lol.  I did....but for me it's a one time expense!
804542,fishindevil,2013-08-23 00:42:00,6254,"Well done cliff !!!!! Welcome to the tournament world !!!!! It won't be your last,you have the fever now !!!! Congrats on cashing a cheque !!!"
804546,northernpike56,2013-08-23 00:58:00,717,"Thats crazy, but well worth the expense lol. Bet it was awesome. Even riding in a convertible at mid 120's km/h is sweet. Feels so awesome to have the wind in your face"
804551,Garnet,2013-08-23 01:35:00,2056,At this point you are a winner. Congrats.  Retire Now.
