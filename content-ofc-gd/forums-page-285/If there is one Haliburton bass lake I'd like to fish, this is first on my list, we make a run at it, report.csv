804056,chris.brock,2013-08-20 16:28:00,4053,"Me and my wife set out, with a canoe and camping gear, with hopes of getting to ""The Secret Lake""    The plan was to get close, set up a base camp, leaving most of our heavy camping gear behind, then make the final push to ""The Secret Lake""  Base Camp    We didn't make it, our energy was zapped from the trip in, when we set out for the ""Secret Lake"", the sight of the first giant log jam made us turn back.  The trip in wiped us out, there was too much of this    and too many of these    too much of this    and too many blow downs from the July 19th storm like this    We still had a good trip, caught some fish and enjoyed it all.  We borrowed a couple lawn chairs from this vacant fly-in camp near our base camp. We returned them the next day    Some rewards for our efforts    All fish released    I guess the ""Secret Lake"" will remain a secret, at least for now.  "
804172,aplumma,2013-08-20 23:47:00,6896,"Looks like a great trip for an adventure. Sorry the lake was not better as a fishing destination. Now post the GPS cord. so no one else makes the same ""mistake"" lol.   Art"
804177,kickingfrog,2013-08-21 00:01:00,8333,"Ya summer trips like that can be tough. Extra growth, lower water and higher weeds. Maybe put that in the spring time trip list pile. Still, it's hard to beat fresh air and some fish."
804181,bigugli,2013-08-21 00:08:00,6138,"You weren't trying to get into McLaren's were you? Great little bass hole, but all the land surrounding is owned by one family, but not the lake. They used to get quite destructive with trespassers decades back if you came in through the marsh."
804189,danc,2013-08-21 00:38:00,4677,That's awesome Chris. A+++ for effort. You'll get there another day I'm sure.
804195,NAW,2013-08-21 01:07:00,4022,That would be way more work than I would ever put towards a Bass!!  You made the right decision!  Nice read Chris.
804205,adempsey,2013-08-21 01:28:00,1498,"Quite the adventure!   Makes you wonder about flying in some times, although your trek was obviously not an easy one.  That outpost looks like it's had some recent repairs.  I guess they are still in operation?"
804211,dhickey,2013-08-21 01:50:00,1038,Nice job.  Nothing like making your way through bush and swamps to get a nice bass. It can be a hard go but well worth the effort.
804245,chris.brock,2013-08-21 04:28:00,4053," the report came across as a failure but it wasn't, we had a blast and the last fish pic is over 4 lbs, the bite seemed off but we still had decent fishing and 2 over 3 lbs  the GPS cord is ""if you've got a float plane, PM me"" Hahaha   I can tell you've done stuff like that, good advice for sure   no, never heard of McLaren's, feel free to PM me the location though, it sounds interesting   yep, still in operation, check your PMs, but if you're interested, I could give you some thoughts about that"
804668,highdrifter,2013-08-23 20:59:00,2534,Nice!!  Kawartha Highlands?!
804670,highdrifter,2013-08-23 20:59:00,2534,ppffftt never mind LOL
805010,johnnyb,2013-08-26 02:01:00,3413,Hey at least you tried....and the fishing was none too shabby at base camp by the looks of it.  Some thick nasty brush back there for sure.....one of these weekends we gotta hookup for a go at it
