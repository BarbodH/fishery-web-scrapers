804279,JustinHoffman,2013-08-21 14:00:00,482,"Hello All, The fishing on the Rideau River has been hot the last couple of days - in sharp contrast to the lacklustre action the previous weeks, smack in the middle of never-ending fronts. This is a short video I filmed on Monday. The largies were stacked on a mid-river wind-swept slop edge. Water depth was approximately 3 to 4 feet and flipping jigs accounted for all fish. "
804285,Roy,2013-08-21 14:38:00,13728,"Fantastic clip, Justin. What are the water temps like there.....low 70's maybe? Thanks for taking the time to post that for us."
804288,JustinHoffman,2013-08-21 14:51:00,482,"Thanks, Roy - water temps. ranged between 73 and 76 the two days I was out (Monday and Tuesday).  Cheers, Justin"
804289,OhioFisherman,2013-08-21 15:00:00,6623,"Great!   Just a tip,if you know someone that does window replacements see if they can get you a couple of old window weights. They are made of cast iron and cylindrical in shape and can slow down a drift on a windy day.   http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p3872.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0&_nkw=Cast+iron+window+sash+weights&_sacat=0&_from=R40"

804329,misfish,2013-08-21 20:21:00,29133,Jealous.
804364,JustinHoffman,2013-08-21 23:23:00,482,"Thanks, guys...  And OhioFisherman - I have a drift sock for that purpose. Works great  Good Fishing, Justin"
804392,nexstar,2013-08-22 02:16:00,63,This is a bass fisherman's dream.   Thanks for sharing.  What's the weight of your jig?
804397,moparhawk,2013-08-22 02:32:00,146,That's a great video.
804401,BillM,2013-08-22 02:45:00,17367,Nice Justin!
804404,woodenboater,2013-08-22 03:02:00,2277,"Man that's just great fishing Justin, non stop bassin'. Curious, I've never seen the mouth palm slap before for helping pop hooks/jigs. Also, would something like a Talon be useful in that shallow slop or do you like drifting into the beds ?"
804434,JustinHoffman,2013-08-22 12:10:00,482,"Nexstar - The jig is a 1/2oz Cx3 in black with a YUM trailer.  Woodenboater - I only use the ""mouth palm slap"" when fish are hooked on the inside top and the mouth and are sticking tight. I am actually not hitting the fish at all, just the head of the jig at the correct angle that pops it out quickly and easily almost every time. As for a talon - yes, would definitely work - especially when the wind is really howling. If the winds are calm, I prefer to cover water, so like to actively move with the trolling motor.  Good Fishing, Justin"
804540,woodenboater,2013-08-23 00:22:00,2277,"ah, cool thanks Justin. Kinda like ripping a bandage off huh  your video gives me another reason why I want to move to the Valley ! that and it's proximity to Quebec"
805073,JustinHoffman,2013-08-26 15:02:00,482,"Woodenboater - living up here is a gem in terms of fishing and outdoor opportunities. So many lakes so close. Quebec is still relatively untapped, and is home to some monster bass!  Hailing from Whitby, and having to fight to launch a boat in Scugog, Rice or the Kawarthas, Ottawa and the surrounds are a breath of fresh air  Good Fishing, Justin"
805447,nexstar,2013-08-29 02:48:00,63,Great info. Thanks for sharing. I wish the Kawartha Lakes have fishery like the Rideau River.
805482,mistaredone,2013-08-29 12:03:00,913,Love that region!  My best bass day ever came off the Rideau.  Totally felt like I was taping a really good bass show.  Great vid!  Thanks for sharing.
