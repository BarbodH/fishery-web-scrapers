805386,Governator,2013-08-28 20:55:00,879,"So a few weeks ago I was on a camping/fishing trip with my buddy, we had all our camping gear on the boat and were heading home when the fish finder went off.  So I dropped down a jig and landed a laker on the go    .  I threw it in the live well and took it home.  This was late on a Sunday and after unloading the gear at home I was pretty tired so I ended up just bagging the fish and tossed it in the deep freezer in the garage.  I've never done that before, as I've always cleaned them before storing.  I was thinking of thawing it in some cold water one morning and check it throughout the day.  Once it's partially thawed I'd clean it.  Do you think the meat would be tainted or fine?"
805388,Sinker,2013-08-28 20:59:00,8692,"It will be fine, no worries at all.  S."
805389,Rich,2013-08-28 21:02:00,3927,I've done it... No worries
805421,Locnar,2013-08-29 00:00:00,645,"I haven't done so with a trout, but I have with other fish. Tasted fine to me. I'm still alive. All is well."
805426,Richie Razor,2013-08-29 00:54:00,536,"I've never done it, but it should be fine as long as the fish is stil cold when dressing it. Commercial fisherman do it and sell the fish to the public, so I believe it'll be just fine"
805439,dhickey,2013-08-29 02:06:00,1038,Its fine. Thaw it out slow in the fridge.  I pack my fish in water and a large  zip lock bags. Just cut the fish into large pieces  (size depending?)
805475,fishindevil,2013-08-29 10:04:00,6254,Yup good to go !!!! Same thing happens when you toss a fish outside
805476,fishindevil,2013-08-29 10:05:00,6254,If the ice hut when you are ice fishing !!! Thaw it clean it and good to go !!!!!
805485,Fish4Eyes,2013-08-29 12:45:00,1022," I'm curious, why do you freeze the fish in water? Are the fillets fully submersed in water?"
805490,mike rousseau,2013-08-29 13:04:00,4661,That's how I do it.... Fillets in water... No air in the bag.... Last a long time in the freezer...
805521,Governator,2013-08-29 15:47:00,879,Great thanks guys!
805559,jimmer,2013-08-29 19:54:00,2730,"It's the only way to freeze fish for any length of time. I find trout don't last as long as warm water species, but still better than no water."
