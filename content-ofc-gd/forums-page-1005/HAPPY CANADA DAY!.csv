221709,Roy,2008-07-01 11:55:00,13728,"Have a great Canada Day everyone. This is my second favorite holiday. The first being Thanksgiving. I suppose that this day is a kind of a giving of thanks for being fortunate enough to live in this great country. I still find myself calling this day ""Dominion Day"" from time to time. Different name, same sentiment. For those of you who may not be familiar with  the beginnings of Canada Day, HERE is a short synopsis.  Enjoy OUR day!"

When I got home from work yesterday, there was an invitation on the front door from our neighbors to come by for a garden party to celebrate the neighbourhood and Canada Day.  Just got back and they are a lovely couple.  Lots of good conversation and so many hor's d'ovres I can't even think about cooking dinner now.  The weather was gorgeous too so it was a great day  Joey"
