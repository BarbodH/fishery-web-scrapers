They were all feeding pretty hard with loads of semi-digested crayfish flying all over the place.  I lost 3 bass that weighed over 4 pounds each. One broke the line and the other 2 spat it on a jump. I did manage to land a 3 pounder, several 2 pounders and countless 14 inchers. Drop shotting worked best by far.  Probably caught 25 bass and lost almost as many.  Need sharper hooks. "
