I never clean them the same day, always a day later, or in this case, today(holiday)  Ummmmmmmmmmmmmm  Fresh..........vs................whatever...............  Just finished filleting it, and cooking it, and eating it, along with scrambled eggs and toast,  and.................................honestly, other than being in the great outdoors,(where everything tastes different over an open fire, (even fried spam sandwiches, have ate them, they were good) | cannot tell the difference between fresh walleye or even 2 days later filleted walleye  I am quite sated presently, and I think I am gonna grab a cold beer to wash it down now, despite the hour.  Heck, its a holiday day!!!!!!!!"

Defrost it, clean it ,cook it and it always tastes great!!  I also noticed that if you put saran wrap on the fillets and let them sit in the fridge for a day, the fish is firmer and fries better also. I'll slightly rinse them in water right before,so the fish crisp sticks.The secret to great tasting fish is using roasted garlic and butter fish crisp and don't fry in burnt oil!!!"
221747,tjsa,2008-07-01 13:59:00,1578," I have indeed frozen them whole myself, when time is limited. I have not noticed any difference in taste when thawed, filleted, and cooked.  Never done the saran wrap thing though."
