221082,bbnotty,2008-06-29 20:28:00,93,"been looking to buy a canoe for a while now. started looking around and most likely have settled on buying a sportspal. I am looking at the 12 ft or the 14 ft, but not sure. 2 people will be in the canoe and it will mainly be used for fishing smaller lakes and rivers. My question is can i get away with buying the 12 ft or should i go for the 14 ft? any feedback is appreciated. Thanks  Berge"
221088,Musky or Specks,2008-06-29 20:43:00,2710,I cant see how two would be able to fish out of a 12ft. Personally I use a 17 and with gear and a cooler anything smaller would be unsuitable.
221090,danbo,2008-06-29 20:45:00,2646,Ditto! A Tandem kayak is fun too..Old Town Twin Otter.
221097,bbnotty,2008-06-29 21:03:00,93,"Musky or specks - makes sense, thanks i think the 14 may be the way to go. would be nice to go 16 but cost is an issue and i don't have that much gear anyway. Danbo - a tandem kayak eh, will have to check it out before deciding.  Thanks guys Berge"
221105,danbo,2008-06-29 21:47:00,2646,Buy a used one! Craigslist or Kijiji..galore!!
221123,jediangler,2008-06-29 22:47:00,1923,I have a 14' transom Sportpal and have been fishing out of it for 14yrs. My buddy bought the 12' transom 3yrs ago. The difference in weight is minimal (14'-58lbs & 12'-53lbs). There is plenty of room for two to fish out of both but more room for gear or a little one in the 14'. You won't be disappointed if you buy a Sportspal.
221379,bbnotty,2008-06-30 14:42:00,93,"Thanks jediangler. i've seen some of your posts. i've decided to go with the 14 ft, was trying to find a used one but no luck there so am now looking at new ones. Thanks again to all that helped me out.  Berge"
221444,johnnyb,2008-06-30 16:49:00,3413,"really can't find any used ones?  That's surprising...betweend Craig's List and Kijiji, there's usually some good options.  When I was looking for a used one around the middle of July last year, CTC put their 16' Coleman RAM-X on sale for $400 ... me and my buddy split it...not the lightest thing in the world, but was a good deal at the time.  I think they are under the Pelican name now...looks like the same boat."
221468,jediangler,2008-06-30 18:02:00,1923,"Sportspals are so well enjoyed by fishermen that they rarely make it up for sale to the general public when used. Usually they stay in the family or get passed on to good fishing buddies first. My brother and I got our first one from an Uncle who had it for 22yrs. That is why I had no hesitation when buying a brand new one. Those plastic canoes at CTC are fine for paddling but are nowhere near as stable as a Sportspal. I wouldn't want to try fishing for musky out of a Pelican, a Coleman or any other canoe. When I bought mine the guy selling it used his for duck hunting and had no problems unloading both barrells of his shotgun over the side without it getting tippy."
