I'm not giving away any secrets by posting to look for the armada offshore from Jackson's Point/Willow and you'll find lakers & whitefish.  Bass are around structure-most shoals hold bass. Same around big & small islands....lots of bass. I've only fished the south end of Simcoe....same boat as you, studying charts as we have a week's vacation on Simcoe's NW shore coming up."
