221602,Rich,2008-07-01 01:56:00,3927,Hit a semi-local pond up today and managed two half decent largies. One fell to a buzzbait and one to a tube jig. Lots of fun.    
221605,TJQ,2008-07-01 02:00:00,7806,Nice biguns'
221613,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-01 02:14:00,0,Those are nice pond bass!!
221619,Musky or Specks,2008-07-01 02:20:00,2710,Hey Rich you ever hit up Teeterville above the dam I 've got some really nice bass outta there.
221620,mattyk,2008-07-01 02:22:00,2110,some nice bass!
221624,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-01 02:25:00,2050,right on rich = thanks for the report dude
221625,Rich,2008-07-01 02:29:00,3927," Not for a couple of years, but yeah definitely some big ones lurking there. There are some other ponds around with some real giants. I know at the Delhi reservoir I saw one that looked about 7 pounds just sunning himself by the dam. Gotta love them trout eating bass!"
221705,b2kptbo,2008-07-01 11:45:00,1505,Couple nice ones for sure...
221802,jediangler,2008-07-01 16:51:00,1923,"Nice fish Rich. They are really light coloured, the water must be very cloudy. Am I right?"
221807,misfish,2008-07-01 17:00:00,29133,"Nice fish Rich. They seem to be whitish looking,whats the water like there?"
221934,Rich,2008-07-01 23:56:00,3927,"Indeed the water had a bit of a stain. Visibility was still probably 3 feet, but this pond is usually crystal clear. Probably the recent high winds we've had stirred it up."
221947,tbayboy,2008-07-02 00:35:00,1497,Couple beauties there Rich.  Nice stuff
221985,Mike the Pike,2008-07-02 01:41:00,3421,Nice looking buckets
