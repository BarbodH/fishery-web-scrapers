221147,tbayboy,2008-06-29 23:57:00,1497,"Ok weak title but luckly thats the worse part of the day Mikeh and I had today.  Started at Mikes house at 6am and by 6:45 we were near Port Perry - at least we think we were...  <a href=""   title=""Foggy Morning by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3237/2622112551_2c129fe0af_b.jpg""'>http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3237/2622112551_2c129fe0af_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Foggy Morning"" /></a>  Nice foggy start to the morning.  Once we got to the water however the fog had lifted and it was actually a pretty nice morning - overcast but no rain.   We headed to our first spot and we both put on top waters.  Why topwater? Well beside being just about the most fun you can have fishing its the easiest way to deal with Scugog:  <a href=""   title=""Can anything be in there by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3271/2622124513_c5786597f0_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Can anything be in there"" /></a>  Sometimes its hard to believe how many fish are lying below there but 3 casts in with his new lure (more on that later) and Mike gets the skunk off the boat and the Bass season started  <a href=""   title=""3 casts in by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3073/2622939304_6496ce1a11_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""3 casts in"" /></a>  That lure is a white X-Rap Walk 13.  Do yourself a favour and just go buy one now.  That lure put a beating on the Bog today.  All day long that thing was getting hits.  Largies and Muskies both (though someone missed the hookset on the Muskie - not pointing fingers but I didn't have one of those lures.....   )  Actually I shouldn't say anything as my topwater form was way off - I probably missed more than I got.  I think Mike was getting sick of seeing me jumping up and down on the back of his boat swearing at myself .  Luckily the fish were pretty aggresive and the firetiger skitter pop produced my first bass of the year  <a href=""   title=""Skitter prop bass by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3003/2622115091_365102616f_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Skitter prop bass"" /></a>  You see I WANTED to use my x-rap walk but someone left it in his pike box at home .....     So I was mixing up all day trying to compete with Mike and the magic horseshoe up its behind super bait but nothing compared.  Even when trying for Muskie I got downsized  <a href=""   title=""Big bait big fish? by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3143/2622116783_26a94ffb2b_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Big bait big fish?"" /></a>  Meanwhile Mike just kept plugging along  <a href=""   title=""Another Xrap Walk Largie by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3248/2622118093_9ab4022acb_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Another Xrap Walk Largie"" /></a>  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2622945144/"" title=""Come to daddy by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3245/2622945144_a5402a8383_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Come to daddy"" /></a>  <a href=""   title=""Mike with another by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/2622120865_330aeed36b_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Mike with another"" /></a>  Not that I wasn't pulling in my fair share of the real lunkers  <a href=""   title=""whos your daddy! by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3029/2622947812_ecceefa068_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""whos your daddy!"" /></a>    Took a bit of a break to admire the herons - they seem to be doing well this year, seeing lots of them wherever I go  <a href=""   title=""Scugog Heron in flight by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3257/2622123163_2bf530373e_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Scugog Heron in flight"" /></a>  In the meantime guess what Mike's doing  <a href=""   title=""Yep, the largies like the weeds by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3125/2622951762_f0dc4798f1_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Yep, the largies like the weeds"" /></a>  We moved away for a while to try trolling for some muskies but it didn't take long before we got the itch so we went back for one last trip to where we started the day.  Of course guess what lure Mike ties back on ..  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2622127353/"" title=""Xrap Walk yet again by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3256/2622127353_bcde0e153d_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Xrap Walk yet again"" /></a>  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2622954310/"" title=""One more for the show by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com /3055/2622954310_1267a0c9f0_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""One more for the show"" /></a>  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2622955432/"" title=""Ole Bucket Mouth by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3228/2622955432_825e974f65_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Ole Bucket Mouth"" /></a>  The last was the biggest of the day - nice big mouth but thin, they were all like that, big mouth empty stomach.    When she came in we could see some nasty weather blowing our way and heard our first thunder boom so we called it a day and headed for the launch.  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2622956544/"" title=""Time to leave by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3030/2622956544_b2037d4198_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Time to leave"" /></a>  Couldn't have timed it much better.  Well ok if we'd left 5 minutes earlier we would have stayed totally dry but compared to the guys in line to get off the water behind us I think we got off easy  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/emosworld/2622957670/"" title=""Got out just in time by Sean Maurik, on Flickr""><img src=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3007/2622957670_1b0b5f0298_b.jpg"" width=""1024"" height=""768"" alt=""Got out just in time"" /></a>  All in all a fun day.  I have to get back into topwater form (wait for the feel of the fish you stupid rookie!!) and I need to find my X-Rap walk and then I'll show Mike how to fish the Bog (I'd better cause I won't be able to use the - 'I don't have that good bait' excuse   )  Take care everyone Sean"
221152,Clampet,2008-06-30 00:04:00,1947,Man that is some thick carpet of weeds! No wonder they call it the 'Bog'!  Good pictures too!

221157,Greencoachdog,2008-06-30 00:26:00,8163,Great report and pics!!!
221166,jediangler,2008-06-30 00:51:00,1923,Well done gentlemen. I'll have to remember to bring my topwater box next trip to the Bog.
221177,Joey,2008-06-30 01:19:00,9122,"Great report and pictures.  I love the heron picture, that's awesome.  Great tip on the topwater.  I'll keep an eye out for one of them next time I'm at BPS or LeBaron.  That's a funky red line Mike is using.  Joey"
221254,Sinker,2008-06-30 04:15:00,8692,"You guys had a stellar day. That rap mike is using looks sweet too......  Looks like you got off the water just in time!! We got on the water, just after that stopped! It was good fishing to day!!  Sinker"
221278,Victor,2008-06-30 11:32:00,1609,Sounds like a fun day on the opener! That's some THICK weeds right there lol ... the fish probably couldn't even see the bait haha
221293,mattyk,2008-06-30 12:08:00,2110,"great report, some nice fish!"
221303,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-30 12:24:00,0,Excellent report. Good to hear you guys got into a mess of bass. Sounds like Mike gave you a schoolin .lol
221380,tbayboy,2008-06-30 14:45:00,1497,"Don't worry Johnny - we're going  back tomorrow and I'm hitting BPS and/or Lebarons tonight to make sure I can even the score.  Also going to try to ""accidentally"" drop his super lure while we're flying along rooster tailing it in the boat"

221417,mikeh,2008-06-30 16:10:00,824,"excellent report , that top water bait was definetaly the hot bait for the day."
221432,Want,2008-06-30 16:32:00,39,"Great pics. Moved my boat to Scugog late last August and gotta admit, the amount of weeds threw me. Didn;'t have much of a topwater selection so I've been buying. Read your post and went out this morning and bought the white X-Rap Walk 13 and the gold one. Thanks for sharing."
221487,ehg,2008-06-30 18:53:00,2666,"Great write up and excellent pictures! Looks like Mike had the right bait in the right spots when the fish were on.  Once i kept a largie from there and was surprised at how good it tasted.  Nice report, ehg"
221488,misfish,2008-06-30 19:02:00,29133,I love fishing over that stuff.Weather it be top water or boiling spinner baits. Great report and nice fish.
221496,gone_fishin,2008-06-30 19:23:00,481,"i have that lure, in the same colour even, wanted to try it for muskies on the bog... looks like it'll be good for the bass too!  great job guys!"
221497,mepps,2008-06-30 19:27:00,1301,"Awesome stuff, thats a solid day of topbogin'n!"
221643,ccmtcanada,2008-07-01 03:20:00,7971,Awesome report Sean!  You guys got into some nice bass up there.  We are headed to the bog first thing tomorrow with the little one to test out the new trolling motor.  Hopefully we'll catch a fish or two as well.
