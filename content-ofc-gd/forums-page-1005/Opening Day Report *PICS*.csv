The tournament is shorter than most 7:30 to 12:30 but it is lots of fun.  Rain greeted us early in the morning however by 10:00 AM the sky lightened and the fish turned on. Before the sun, our fish came on tubes and spider grubs, after the sun it was jerkbaits and spinnerbaits mostly.  Most teams caught between 12 and 15 bass for the 5 HR tournament.Weigh in at 12:30 under partly cloudy skies and it remained great for the BBQ.  I dont have them all, but the The top 4 Weights were:  Steve Rowbotham/Brent MacLennan           16.40 Lb    Bill Todd/Jo Ann Jackson                             16.00 Lb    Aaron Anders/Sarah                                     15.50 Lb    Scott Shaw                                                   13.95 Lb    A very fun day all in all"
