220347,Marty,2008-06-27 15:04:00,873,"I would just like to say that this year's Lakair trip was magical.    For the first time, my 5 year old son, Dawson, made it to Canada.  The members of this board are so special.   You made him feel so special.   He came home with more lures than his daddy owns.   Special thanks to TJ, Monique, Avery and Jaden for making him feel so special.    Thanks to Roy, John, Rick, Lew, Spiel and everyone else who were so good to him.  I know I'll leave somebody out and I apologize.   Everyone was so great.  I probably don't need many words with these pics because they obviously speak for themselves but here goes:  Dawson's first Canadian fish.   Think he's happy?    His first ""pickeral"", which ended up in his belly:    Another one.   Geez, they're getting bigger:    Dawson and his pappy with their tournament entries.   Pappy had two but one was released at the dock.    Dawson with his entry.    Hmmm, I wonder how many Dad caught (thanks Spiel and TJ).    Another one of them Canadian fish:    Dawson and TJ cooking up Dawson's first pick:      Pappy trying to pull off the country gentleman thing:    Glen trying to teach Dawson some southern arson things:    The little guy fished on that dock until he figured out how to cast one of those things:     Finally, three generations of Dietz's.    Truly unbelievable.     Thanks again everyone.    It was a blast."
220350,Spiel,2008-06-27 15:10:00,9065,"....Bravo, was good to meet the furture of the Dietz clan.  Nothing says good times like the smile on a young anglers face."
220351,lew,2008-06-27 15:11:00,12767,"That's by far the best Lakair report from this year Marty and it was such a treat seeing Dawson enjoying his 1st Canadian trip so much.  It was also great to see 3 generations of your family together like that.  I'd hoped you & I could have gotten a little musky fish'n in together this year but obviously that couldn't happen, but hopefully next time.  Have a blast on your up-coming French River trip too"
220352,Roy,2008-06-27 15:14:00,13728,"It was a pleasure seeing all three of you having a good time Marty. Great seeing you and Ed again and just super meeting up with the big guy, Dawson."
220355,ccmtcanada,2008-06-27 15:15:00,7971,Great meeting 3 generations!  The smiles say it all though.  Glad to hear you all had such a good time up there.  Hope to see you all again in about a year!
220357,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-27 15:26:00,0,Looks like the little guy enjoyed himself immensely. A fishing trip he wont forget anytime soon. I'm sure he is already looking forward to the next fishing trip in Canada. Thanks for sharing.
220381,LeXXington,2008-06-27 17:10:00,1928,Glad to see little Dawson out there we need more that age to ensure Lakair trip goes on for ever  One of these years I will get too bring my little guy too
220389,huntervasili,2008-06-27 17:31:00,1604,Great meeting the three of you and glad he enjoyed himself as much as you did. A beatiful final pic with the 3 generations of Dietz men
220407,motv8tr,2008-06-27 18:05:00,2587,"What a GREAT smile!!!  He's a sweet young man, but if he keeps taking lessons from Dawg on how to set fires, he's gonna need a good lawyer  Like the others said, it was great seeing three generations having such a good time together, and I'm sure there will be many more such trips in the future.....I just hope you survive getting out the door without the young fella to head up to the French  Maureen"
220412,John,2008-06-27 18:12:00,2956,"It's reports like this that make it all worthwhile. Seeing three generations, Dawson, Marty and Ed all enjoying themselves was a sight to behold.  Hope that Dawson told his Mom how many fish Daddy caught.......  Little worried there about him being coached by the 'bama pyromaniac though...."
220416,Kirk,2008-06-27 18:23:00,347,"Nice to see him smiling and must be a great feeling to have him eat his catch, healthy appetite.  good job"
220421,misfish,2008-06-27 18:53:00,29133,What a great report Marty. Love it when you see the kids smiling. Thanks for sharing.
220441,Rich Clemens,2008-06-27 20:16:00,3131,Same here for what the rest have said.  It was a pleasure meeting you folks and I didn't realize you live in the same state as I do.   Dawson was on cloud nine with his overstuffed bag of goodies at the end of the day on Saturday.   That's what it's all about.   My guess is that Dawson already made his reservations for next year.  Oh yeah ... he better bring a bigger bag.
220458,crappieperchhunter,2008-06-27 21:28:00,2582,These type of reports are what keeps me on this site. Thanx for sharing.
220461,Daplumma,2008-06-27 22:06:00,1961,"Was good to meet Dawson and see you and Ed again.Its scary how fast they grow up,seems like yesterday I was fishing every second I could when we would go on vacation. Joe"
220516,HTHM,2008-06-28 01:24:00,4082,"I wasn't there, but I would say it is these type of sites and people that cause these reports.  WTG Dawson!"
220542,wvmedic,2008-06-28 03:33:00,144,"Marty, great post glad to see Dawson enjoyed him self so much. By his smile in every picture itâ€™s quite evident that he did.  You are creating memories for him that he will never forget, I can tell you my first Canadian trip was around his age and about 5 subsequent trips all at Lakair. The last one when I was 15 that was some 25 years ago and I have not forgotten my trips there as a young man.  And think goodness I will be back there the first week of August to rekindle all of those memories.  Jeff."

221185,Joey,2008-06-30 01:32:00,9122,"Great report and  pics Marty.  Dawson is such an angel.  He sure looked like he enjoyed himself, well, until the tackle bag incident     But that worked itself out.  Looking forward to seeing you guys next year.  Will Dawson be coming again?  Joey"
221302,Chuck Best,2008-06-30 12:24:00,308,"Yup,it was a great time,fun had by all,and we've seen the pics......Now what we really want Marty....RECIPES,Com'on bud,don't be holding out on us.....LOL........TC and tight lines.....Chuck...."
221347,Smokey,2008-06-30 13:41:00,1278,"Awesome pics Marty. He has a great big smile in every pic while holding the fish, nice to see him out there enjoying himself.  Mike"
221453,Marty,2008-06-30 17:07:00,873,"Chuck,  I'll get them up soon under a different thread.   I gotta make some calls first to make sure I'm right when I post them."
221502,Squid,2008-06-30 19:42:00,1656,Awesome report Marty!! Dawson will have these memories for a long time.
