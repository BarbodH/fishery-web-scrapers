221640,solopaddler,2008-07-01 03:14:00,8605,Short but sweet report  . You're a lucky man to live so close to such a great spot!
221641,Rich,2008-07-01 03:15:00,3927,Awesome man! Glad to see the bigguns are still in there. I beat it to death last year and only caught dinks. Obviously you got da skills!  Congrats!
221722,The Urban Fisherman,2008-07-01 12:30:00,2050," Dude - I beat it to death last year to and never managed anything over 2lbs.  But on saturday they were everywhere - I saw one pod of 4 fish that were all easily as big as my PB.  I must have spotted 10 or more in that size range.  It was crazy, but they wouldn't bite if they could see you.  I had to back off and come back at them later on.  (a little trick I've recently learned) I knew where they were spawning from my bluegill trips, so I just fished in about 10 to 15 FOW off to the side.  If you ever fish it, fish it deep - that's where the brutes hang out.  Probably never happen again, but here's hoping.  Cheers.."
220798,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-29 00:14:00,2050,"Gotta keep this short as my daughter's sittin' on my lap and is more impatient than me!  Went to the little reservoir down the road today for bass opener...have a million things to get done to the house before my wedding august second so I promised the Fiance I'd be home for lunch.  Quick and simple...  Largemouth were post spawn, sitting on deeper weed edges and willing to eat.  I fished for about 3 hours, landed at least 40 fish, many of which were 2 to 3 lbs with one 19.5 inch bucket which was easily my PB largie.  temp: 72 Baits : Senko, Flippin' Jig, X-Rap.....   X-rap produced the bigguns of the day.  Happy opener all!  Cheers, UF"

221519,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-30 20:32:00,2050," nah I still haven't had a chance to put the camera in - there was a retired couple fishing not far from me on the dock and they helped me out.  I always bring my camera with me, but wasn't counting on catching a PB so I left it at home....GO FIGURE....ended up having them take pix for me with my camera phone...turned out ok!  Good fishin' all, Ryan"
