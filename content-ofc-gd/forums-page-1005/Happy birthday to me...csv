221435,JohnF,2008-06-30 16:33:00,3494," That's young too. Dayum. This is getting depressing. Seems there's only one person on this board I can call an old fart, and he's mere months older. Mebbe this explains why all the young kids hold doors for me, call me sir and offer to carry stuff to the car. Man, I'm gonna stop drinking Ovaltine.  Oh well, Happy Birthday Dano.  JF"
221478,douG,2008-06-30 18:32:00,2693,"There is nothing wrong at all with Ovaltine, I grew up sorta in Peterborough for heavens' sakes.  Happy Birfday to Dano, hope you enjoyed all the tributes due to you.  Best Fishes as well."
