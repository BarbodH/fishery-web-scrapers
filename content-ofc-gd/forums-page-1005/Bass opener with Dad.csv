220956,FISHINGNUT,2008-06-29 13:36:00,253,Well the morning wasnt looking good with all the rain but I had to get out so off we went .After sitting at the lake for an hour waiting for the rain to let up we finally got the boat in the water.We fished for a couple hours and didnt do to bad .We were worried the downpours and lightnig returning  so we fished the area pretty quick .Most were caught on senkos  and a couple on tubes on a variety of colours.
