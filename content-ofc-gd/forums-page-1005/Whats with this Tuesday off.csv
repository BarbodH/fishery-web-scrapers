221694,tjsa,2008-07-01 10:55:00,1578," Yeah, the Tuesday holiday is different, but I actually enjoyed working on the Monday, all my bosses booked off, no phone calls, relatively few e-mails, etc. etc.................. I had free reign to do lots of the little stuff that normally gets lost in the fray, and usually ends up biting me in the rear 3 months later. I didn't completely catch up on the little stuff, but I did make major inroads to offset their effect on me 3 months hence.   OHHHHH!!!!!!! and I am off on this coming Friday also, so I am in line with our American members for a nice long weekend coming up. Gotta love that."
