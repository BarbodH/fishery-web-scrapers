221365,TJQ,2008-06-30 14:25:00,7806,"Thanks for all the kind words!!  Its been three years in the making, but I think we are about as ""comfortable"" as you can get without actually building a cabin.  I was very happy to see the fishing pick up.  I really hope that we will be spending an inordinate amount of time up there this summer.  Now that the building is over....  the wifes looking for a paddle boat for up there!!"
221369,LeXXington,2008-06-30 14:28:00,1928,"Amazing pics TJ., Thanks for Sharing"
221372,Spiel,2008-06-30 14:32:00,9065,"....Now that's a full plate family weekend!  And that pike, whoa.....what a hog, nicely done Monique, nicely done!"
221374,Musky or Specks,2008-06-30 14:33:00,2710,Great Report. Thats one huge pike. Very girthy!!! Sounds like you have a great family and enjoy a wonderful outdoor lifestyle together. Your daughter is one tough cookie. My 16yr old son whines like a little girl when the black flies have him chewed up like that.
221376,Bly,2008-06-30 14:36:00,1556,"Excellent report Tj and Monique.......Sweeet Pike!!!    Camp Jiggy Jiggy looks great, you guys deserve it  Wondered how well that water heater would work...thanks for that.  Nice write up on the lures, I am hoping to get out this week and try out the top waters now that bass is open.  I haven't had much success with Bass, hoping to get an edge with the new lures  hehe   Thanks for taking the time to put that all together to share with us"

Avery is becoming a Man...What is that on his upper lip? forgot to wash up after dinner? And Jaden is becoming a lady in her own right... if she is willing to kiss a slimey green fish... I imagine them boys in Sturgeon Falls are in trouble!  Awesome family report TJ, thanks for sharing you're adventures with us.  G"

221223,oxcowboy,2008-06-30 02:44:00,544,"great report tj,  glad to see the fishing is picking up there.  i can only imagine how bad the skeeters are there.   they are bad enough on a dry year.  are the black flies still going strong or heading the other way?  my crappy dial up wont let me see the big pike, but i have a good imagination.  the camp looks great.   glad ya got into a ton of fish and some great family time.  jason"

221282,b2kptbo,2008-06-30 11:44:00,1505,"Really great report, a good way to start a Monday, thaks for sharing..."
221297,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-30 12:13:00,0,Excellent report!! The fishing has probably been slow because of the late summer. Water temps are down and so are the weeds. It should be picking up big time right about now.  That is one Monster pike!! I've heard of many big pike caught on top waters. Especially in the spring.That area certainly has a lot of potential for big fish. The fishing can only get better once you figure out that lake.
221317,Reef Runner,2008-06-30 12:52:00,981,"Ossie and Harriet's fishing adventure.  lol  Wonderful report TJ!  That is one monster pike, and on 8pound no leader, congrats Monique!  You got a slice of heaven there, and you kids are just angels (probably from Moniques side. hehe)  Thanks for sharin with us.  reefrunner"
