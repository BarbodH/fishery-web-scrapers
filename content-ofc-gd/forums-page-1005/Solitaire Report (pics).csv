221388,Reef Runner,2008-06-30 15:18:00,981,"Good day,  Five O'clock Friday leaving work and stuck in Toronto traffic, I was listening to the weather reports and figuring if I should head up to the cottage or not.  It called for rain and possible thunderstorms but hey, ya can't catch fish from the couch.  So with the weekend allotted for minor car maintanence and some   a stop at CTC and I was on the road by 8:30pm.  I arrived at my destination around 10:30pm.  Was too beat to get out on the lake so a peaceful campfire by the water and a couple Coronas to keep me company sufficed the evening's entertainment.  As my title indicates, it was the first time out there on my own this year.  So I had to get a stance goin for my future photos.  Here's me fishful thinking  Needless to say, it was released back into the atmosphere to grow up and get realistic about things.  Reality kicked in about half an hour later, when I get a hit on my trusty white spinnerbait running over top of a thick weedbed.  Measured in at 24inches.  Saw a really cool plane that was landing and taking off the water...look how close he was getting to some boats, hehe  I know there are some aviators here.    who can guess that plane!  Here is some take off shots.       I packed it in around 2pm totalling 4 pike and one dinky Largie that wasn't worth the photo, although it was my first legal bass of '08.  I was disappointed to see the guide tip on my spinning outfit damaged and kept slicing my braid.  She has been retired until I can fixn it up.  I cleaned out my massive K&N air filter and got the sunroof to open back up again (essential as I dont have AC).  Got back out on the water at 5pm and the sun came out to greet me.  Tossed out a couple of Ryan Landry's black lures and third cast in with the shallow runner rap I get a decent hit and manage to haul in this  Me thinks that lure will find a home in my box!  Another pike I scored later that evening.   I was on a mission to get some inches for the team,  and I finally got a decent pike to beat our 25incher on the board. 27inches, Taper, I'll send you a PM shortly.   Got off the water around 9:30pm.  Sunday the weather was cold, rain off and on.  I tossed everything I had in my box.  Did my usual milk run...nada.  Only bite I had was seeing my chartruse 5inch senko do a B-line on a short drop but I didn't get a good hook set.  I'll be back...grin.  Church is tossing lures listening to the History of Rock n' roll with Allan Cross in my Heaven.    Hope y'all enjoyed my report,  reefrunner"
