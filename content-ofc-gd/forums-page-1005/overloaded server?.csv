It lags on server requests or i get no response at all quite frequently..i would say they're less than 2-3 days apart for me.     If this is on a dedicated or co-located system, it might be time to upgrade or find a new host.  I'm guessing that's what caused the duplicate  post that just went up and it's happened to me before too."
