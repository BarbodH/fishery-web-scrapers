221861,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-01 20:03:00,0,Congrats on the first pickerel of the year and congrats to your daughter's first largie. I used to fish Hastings a lot when I was a kid and I used to haul in 1+lb bluegill after the other and lots of bass and pickerel in between. Now the fishing has died somewhat but there is still good fishing in that area. thanks for sharing.
