221509,Burtess,2008-06-30 19:59:00,901,"I am going down to Orlando and renting a house this fall and there is a couple of public ponds and a small lake near by.  I want to try for some exotics (tilapia, peacock bass, red devils, etc.) and am wondering if the local Walmart/Kmart etc. sells non-resident fishing licences.  I don't want to get down there and find out that Walmart/Kmart etc. only sells resident licences.  Anyone have any personal experience with this?  Thanks, Burt"

221567,Crazyhook,2008-07-01 00:03:00,1154,do a search you can get them online before you go
221570,wvmedic,2008-07-01 00:23:00,144,"Burt, not sure about Fl. But last year when we went to Ocracoke Island, Nc. We stopped at Kitty Hawk, NC and bought our saltwater license. And a month later we were in Wilmington, Nc and got our saltwater license at Wal-Mart.  I would say if they have a sporting goods dept. you will be good to go.  If in doubt you can call them and ask.  Wal-Mart 3838 S Semoran Blvd, Orlando, FL - (407) 277-4314â€Ž  Not sure if this will be the closest one to you there are 9 in that area but they should be able to tell you what you need to know.  Or you can get them online at Florida fish and wildlife or call 1-888-FISH FLORIDA.  Jeff."
221589,Greencoachdog,2008-07-01 01:31:00,8163,"I know you can get a non resident license at Wal-Mart, not sure about Kmart. There's also the Bas Pro as mentioned earlier.  Besides the small lakes and ponds, you may also want to try what I call ""ditch fishin'"". Fishing the small drainage ditches that criss cross down there. You can pull some really amazing fish out of those things with a small inline spinner, Tilapia, Oscars, Bowfin, Spotted Florida Catfish, Gar, and Bass to name just a few.  While driving around, if you should happen to see one (ditch) that looks accesable... pull over and try it! You can also catch Wild Golden Shiners with dough balls on a #8 hook and use them for BIG Bass bait on a 3/0 circle hook.  Be sure to take lotsa pics!!!  ... and try a big fat Marshmallow too!!!"
221592,mepps,2008-07-01 01:38:00,1301,I got a Georgia license at Walmart. Their Walmarts are so much better then ours.
221608,bassman,2008-07-01 02:08:00,384,You can order a license online at the link below:  http://myfwc.com/license.html  It takes about a week for you to receive in the mail. I just got mine this week.   Good luck
