221398,Weeds,2008-06-30 15:40:00,782,"Well, yesterday I decided I'd switch things up and give musky fishing a bit of a break and try for bass (which I can't seem to catch for the life of me) so I started the day tossing a 1/4 ounce jig and worm. My very first cast into a weedbed and a small perch takes the bait, and as I real it in a musky hits it maybe 5 feet from shore, was super cool to see as I've heard about it happening to others but never experienced it. Very, very cool. Almost immediately he bites through the line; I made no attempt to reel him in as my drag is set way to tight and theres 6lb mono on the ugly stik and I know a prolonged stress cause these guys to belly up. After a minute of basking in the experience I wonder if he'll strike again so I toss out the Suick on the Jerkbait rod. Strike he does, at least I'm assuming it was the same fish, and I land myself a chunky 36'er.  This Suick has got to be the best lure ever, it's pulling musky out of spots I've been blanked at countless times before. Next time I'm down in Toronto I wanna give it a go for pike (which I can't seem to catch either). Sorry, actually took a pic (crummy) but can't remember how to upload them. Well, Cheers...."

221425,TJQ,2008-06-30 16:20:00,7806,Thats a cool story!
221456,Reef Runner,2008-06-30 17:14:00,981,Cool experience.  Congrats on getting into some Ski's.

221485,tbayboy,2008-06-30 18:45:00,1497,Very cool Weeds.  I've just been converted to a suick fan myself.  Lets see that crummy pic !!!
221506,Weeds,2008-06-30 19:52:00,782,"Allright, but only cause you asked for it....probably take me less time to catch a ski than figure out how to post the pic, but give me a second here...."
221508,Weeds,2008-06-30 19:57:00,782,"   Is this right? Yep. After 20 something edits. Told you it was a real crappy pic, looks a little like a sardine. How does every one take such cool shots, only reason I even had the camera out was I figured he might hit again. Normally I'm kind of in a panic to get to get it unhooked and back in the water. I need a tripod or something. A fishing buddy would probably do too."
221639,Rich,2008-07-01 03:13:00,3927,"Nice one, looks like he has some battle scars on his tail too. Maybe he PO'd ""Omega Musky"""
221647,ccmtcanada,2008-07-01 03:22:00,7971,That's pretty cool!!!  And the pic isn't so bad...thanks for posting it!

221711,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-07-01 12:00:00,0,Looks like a good pic to me! Thanks for sharing!
221830,Weeds,2008-07-01 18:39:00,782,Well thanks for the encouragement gents....I'll try and get a more standard me and the fish pic next time. If I'm lucky maybe tonight. Although I really should be working.
