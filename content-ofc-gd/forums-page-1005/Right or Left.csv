221383,Greencoachdog,2008-06-30 14:54:00,8163, Nope!   ... just looks funny
221392,Reef Runner,2008-06-30 15:27:00,981,"Wow, I can't beleive this surfaced again.  Floated back up to the top of the bowl eh?  Well, originally I posted thgis topic because I was in the market for a baitcaster and never used one.  I noticed that those who spin left ofthen baitcast right.  I took the advice of many as to what you feel is more comfortable and ended up buying a lefty Abu C3 and I love it.  Became my new go to rod and reel combo.  Now I am to repay all your knowledge in fishing reports.  reefrunner"
221423,JohnF,2008-06-30 16:18:00,3494," So what's one more little detail with all there is to laugh at in my casting methodology? I had Garry and Albert in stitches the other day. Of course they were polite about it, and only laughed when they thought I wasn't looking.  JF"
221438,Greencoachdog,2008-06-30 16:38:00,8163," Welcome to the ""Run Away Thread"" club!!!"
221439,Roy,2008-06-30 16:41:00,13728,"If we had four hands, this thread would have 10 pages."
221106,JohnF,2008-06-29 21:51:00,3494," Us Canuckian boys grew up playing hockey. I guess when the coach said I need as many players who shoot left as right a bunch of us just said ""Yup, OK coach."" In fact I think most of us just felt more comfortable with our power and control hand on the top of the stick. For me it translated into baseball too, although while I played I wasn't a bad switch hitter. But I couldn't shoot right in hockey to save my soul. When I started to play golf left just felt better than right. My son, the golf pro, told me I had a beautiful swing right handed. Too bad I couldn't hit the damned ball. So left I hit it, not a helluva lot better, but better.  When I started fishing it seems that the cranks were always on the left side of the spinning reels so I just natcherly started cranking left. It felt good. I always cast with one hand with a spinning rod and it just seemed to be easier to time the line release and the wrist snap with my dominant hand. Cranking is a no brainer. Even my left hand can do it and nature has somehow arranged it that my left hand is not connected to my brain for anything requiring hand eye coordination.  Then I bought the baitcaster. Garry (of 2 RR's fame) kinda looked like he was gonna make me walk home from the middle of the lake when I sprung that fine little piece of equipment on him, but then he bit his tongue, said something like ""Yeah. Well, okay, if that's what you bought."" But after trying his, or mebbe it was Albert's, right hander I just didn't feel good with the crank in my right hand. Why would I add another step into the equation. Cast, switch, lock and wind - or cast, lock, switch and wind or just cast, wind. It's simply not intuitive. Seems to me all these right hand crankers are victims of a marketing paradigm, except the left handed ones. Efficiency dictates that I crank with the left hand. The damned rods are too heavy to trust to a single hand cast for one thing. I tried it off Garry's boat and felt like I came within an inch of chucking my shiny new Quantum in Whatchamacallit Lake. I like two hands for baitcasting. Mebbe when I grow up I'll be better at one handing  but for now I'm a two hander. I like where my left hand is positioned for getting to the crank to start the magic when the lure bounces off the dock and sinks to the right depth.  If it gives right handers intestinal gas issues, tough. That's why we're out in the open air. As long as yer downwind of me, let 'er rip. Just don't spook the fish.  JF"
221108,addict,2008-06-29 21:57:00,475,usually crank it with my right but if im feeling frisky ill crank it with the left
221143,jace,2008-06-29 23:52:00,472,"  sounds like me.  Although they sayyour power hand up front and pivot on the weaker arm, it feels awkward to me when i shoot  puck right handed.  It could also be that i'm weaker on that side of my skating too which throws in a whole new bag of reasons.    golf i'm right though.  hehe.  baseball right, i'm slightly in more control right hand bike turns unless it's a trike or quad.  ahah.   For distance, i need to cast both hands but it can be either side.  My right thumb is smarter than my left thumb but it doesn't cause any problems.  For pitching and flipping, i'm MUCH faster with the rod in the right hand but that's only becasue i started on a spinning rod ages ago, long before they called it pitching and flipping.  So how do you cast a pistol grip casting rod two handed?"
221154,Clampet,2008-06-30 00:09:00,1947,"I'm right handed and reel with my left. My right arm provides improved casting accuracy and strength for better control.  All my left hand has to do, is turn the handle in a circle. (And bail the boat  )."
221164,Greencoachdog,2008-06-30 00:46:00,8163, Aren't pistol grip rods for children?
221178,jace,2008-06-30 01:19:00,472,"  No, but they're becoming less popular.  You can still find the StCroix pistol grips without looking too hard.   It wasn't too long ago when pistol grips were all you saw on ""bass"" fishing gear.   In the last 2-3 years split grips have taken over and they're all the rage and kitty's butt in the must-have rods.   If you watch the custom rod scene, you'll be surprised how fast the big manufacturers pick up on the newest popular ideas in the custom rod market.  Besides the split grip, the latest things to make it into factory rods is Japanese hard EVA grips, rods with no foregrips (like Kistlers and TD), using just skeleton seats (no insert) with a fully exposed blank, and tiny single foot fly guides for running guides on spin/cast rods."
221196,Clampet,2008-06-30 01:50:00,1947," That's so gay, not that there is anything wrong with that."
221330,Garry2Rs,2008-06-30 13:12:00,1425,"If you are a Pro, use what you like! If you are a rookie learn to cast with a right handed reel if you are right handed, and vise-versa. I would be pleased to teach you using my equipment and I'm sure many other experienced guys would make the same offer.. As a beginner you don't know what's comfortable or efficient etc.  All you have is an idea based on doing something else. The world is full of typists who, on the first day of school thought they would never be able to type with there weak hand.... Once you are able to cast using ""standard"" equipment, you can make up your own mind what is right for you. Okay let's talk basics... With spinning tackle you hold the reel at the reel seat, unless you are a rookie...grin. You hook the line on your finger and release it as you cast.  This is a coordinated move and is easiest for most folks when they use their strong hand.  There is no need to reposition the hands after the cast and so it makes sense to reel with the weak hand. The same is true in fly fishing, although most fly reels are set-up to crank right... This is not true in bait casting! With most bait casting reels, unless your trolling, the preferred way to hold them is called ""palming.""  If you can't picture it already, all it means is that you hold the body of the reel in the palm of your hand.  The purpose is to eliminate the wobble caused by cranking.  If you hold the rod handle in casting position, like a pistol grip, the reel wants to torque up and down as you crank.  This is very tiring on the wrist of the hand holding the rod. You also look like a rookie...hahaha. By passing the rod from your casting hand to your weaker hand, you automatically take the reel in the palm of your hand. If you cast right, reel left there is no good way to change your hand position to this more comfortable and efficient grip. There are times when you see Pro's using wrong handed reels.  This is usually for Flipping and Pitching...Short, underhanded casts.  The bait is swung toward the target generally in thick cover and shallow water, and the problem is you can ""get bit"" and be snagged before you can get the reel back in gear.  Some reels come with a flipping switch, that lets you put the reel in gear without touching the crank-handle.  So far these are all on mid-price reels not top-of-the-line models, so some Pro's use reels that crank on the wrong side so that they can drop the reel into gear as the bait is falling. One last thought... About 20% of the world is left handed.  I read that 40% of the bait-casters that are sold are left handed. Most of the reels for sale on E-Bay are left handed...I thing about 20% of the people bought the wrong reel! By the way I am looking for a used left handed reel or two for my left handed clients."
221338,Greencoachdog,2008-06-30 13:29:00,8163, ... and that would be because they're just aboot useless!
221360,Greencoachdog,2008-06-30 14:17:00,8163,The ones that really make me laugh are the ones that hold a spinning rod upsidedown (reel on top) and turn the crank handle backwards!!!
172956,Billy - Curtiss,2008-03-18 11:00:00,241,It's the right hand for me all the way!
173002,Reef Runner,2008-03-18 13:34:00,981,"Great discussion  The third option in question 1 should say ambidexterous.  Thanks Dawg, been saying it wrong for all these years....lol, now where's my dunce cap?  Anyway, bought my new Abu 6501 C3 last night, left hand retrieve (hence the 01), and just can't wait to use it.  reefrunner"
173007,Terry,2008-03-18 13:48:00,14456,I'd give my left hand to be ambidextrous.....   left hand...ambidextrous....never mind..seemed funny at the time..........   spin left.. baitcaster right...
172643,MJL,2008-03-17 19:40:00,2427,"I guess I'm omnidextrous.  I think I was a natural born lefty who grew up in a world with almost everything geared towards righties.  My grandmother thought I was retarded when for the first 18yrs of my life, I didn't know how to use chop-sticks with my right hand...Tried them out with my left and within 10 seconds got the hang of it.  When I write, I'm pretty much a mirror image of a lefty which could explain why my writing is so nasty - Probably the result of looking at everyone else in kindergarten class and seeing what hands they were using.  For computer mice, both hands feel equally comfortable.  For spinning and centrepin reels, I crank with my left.  For baitcasting, either hands feels OK.  For fly fishing I cast with my right but can throw fairly tight loops to about 40ft with my left."
172658,Beans,2008-03-17 20:00:00,3339,"Christmas of 1948 I received my first rod and reel...up until then I used a bamboo cane pole...The rod was spring steel and the reel was a Shakespeare ""Wondereel"" (right hand retreive) (no free spool...everything turned when you casted...handle included) so I learned to cast with my right and switch hands to retreive...Along came open faced spinning reels with left hand retreive and found it easy to cast right and retreive left...but when the new version of baitcasters came on the market I naturally bought a right hand retreive 'cause it just felt right that way..."
172664,Rich Clemens,2008-03-17 20:09:00,3131,"I don't have any baitcasting reels (yet). I am right-handed, but all my open-faced spinner reels ... I reel with my left."
