We heartily congratulate our readers on the event, and fervently pray that all the blessings anticipated from the measure, by its promoters, may be fully realized. As far as the people of Upper Canada are concerned, the inauguration of the new constitution may well be heavily rejoiced over as the brightest day in their calendar. The Constitution of 1867 will be famous in the historical annals of Upper Canada, not only because it brought two flourishing Maritime states into alliance with the Canadas, and opened up new markets for our products, and a direct railway route to the Atlantic through British territory, but because it relieved the inhabitants of Western Canada from a system of injustice and demoralization under which they had suffered for a long series of years.""  Some didn't think so  On Confederation Day the Halifax Chronicle carried the following announcement: ""Died! Last night at 12 o'clock, the freed and enlightened province of Nova Scotia.""
