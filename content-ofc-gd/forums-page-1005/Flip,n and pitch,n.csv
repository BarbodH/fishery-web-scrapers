221363,Victor,2008-06-30 14:24:00,1609,Some nice bass Brian & Terry! It's such a sad sight to see all those floating carp...
221483,douG,2008-06-30 18:41:00,2693,Great to see two of my favourite board members on the water once again.  Best to Brian and Terry.  I have other favourite board members too.
221025,misfish,2008-06-29 17:46:00,29133,"Not touching a rod since last November,it was time to get out and get back into the swing of things. So after yesturday and seeing all the boats and fish,I was ready to hit the waters again. I met up with my bud Terry at the river and it was a great calm morning.    During our trip down the river,there was a stinch in the air. Hundreds of dead carp floating all along the banks. It was,a very sadding sight. Im not a carp fisher,but I can just amagine what this kind of site would mean to one.At first we thought it would be a waste of time fishing for them buckets with this kill happening,but we gave it a go anyways. Tought conditions to say the lease. Trying to pitch in good spots and there would be a dead carcuss in the same area. Decided to try a run further down the river,maybe the dead carp would be less. Sure enough we found a few good stretches where the carp die off was limited and we,well Terry started to get into them.     The forcasted rain that was to start around 9 am did not really appear,but we did get a bit of a drizzel,then Terry got another.    I believe the score at the end of the day was Terry 8,myself 3.He put the smack down on them. I told Terry I was fishing for quality,you know,those 5 good bites. Cant be playing with thos small fish. LOL Baits used today were craw tubes on jigs and beaver tails and  bucket slammers.   Terry has the rest of the phots as I knew my cam was crap,so we used his most of the time.Plus his makes my fish look bigger. HAHAHAHA  Thanks pal for the time today. Lets do it again real soon.Hope yer arm is ok for work Monday. It,s a beatch getting old aint it.LOL  Later bud"

221081,misfish,2008-06-29 20:28:00,29133,"When we were in the 19 footer, I had a chance. He couldnt cover everything,but when yer in a 16 footer,well,I get the endtrails sorta speak. Terry left me the back spots. I like the ones deep in there,he takes the front spots.(That didnt sound right I know   ) No worries,smallies will be his down fall.HAHAHAHA Im still smile,n about gett,n out.

221086,misfish,2008-06-29 20:38:00,29133," Yes he did,but,I thought I might fall off the seat,or the seat was booby trapped. HA"
221092,Terry,2008-06-29 20:56:00,14456,"so, you do know why I wanted you up front  now I have to reweild my seat"

221174,Joey,2008-06-30 01:13:00,9122,"Great report B.  You have no idea how happy it makes me to see you out there fishing again  Some beauty buckets there, although I'm skeptical about the last pic Terry posted  That's really a shame about the carp.  I sure hope they figure out the problem and fix it.  Joey"
