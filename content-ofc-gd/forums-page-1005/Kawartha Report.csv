221929,muskylund1,2008-07-01 23:39:00,18,"I just returned from a week on Lower Buckhorn. For the week we boated 16 muskies between my 83 year old Dad, my brother and myself..  The weather seemed to put the muskies off a bit and the average size was lower than normal. My buddy Jason who was staying in another cabin caught a 45"" at the beginning of the week. My best musky last week was a 38"" on a black/silver bucktail. My brother took a 40"" on an M&G Tandem Spin. I lost a low to mid 40 inch musky that bit me off on a Zara Spook with no leader. I'll have to remember to use a leader next time.  We also caught and released 7 Bass over 4 pounds, including 2 Smallmouths over 20"". Most of the Bass were taken on tube jigs, but at least of the 4 pounders was taken on a Zara Spook and Dad got a 20"" Smallmouth on a buzzbait.  No pics because the film is still in the camera. I will post some pics when I get them developed.  Tom"
