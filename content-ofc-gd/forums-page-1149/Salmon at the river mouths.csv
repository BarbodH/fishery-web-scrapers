113107,xrap,2007-09-12 20:12:00,683,  Don't forget the Harpons!!
113115,kemper,2007-09-12 20:38:00,2232,"Yep, was drifting yesterday. There are some browns in and I think I even spotted a bow. My trick? Stay away from the pools with fifteen 20 pounds class salmon and 8 guys trying to snag them. I shoot for the trout, and smaller salmon. Its called fishing, not snagging!"
