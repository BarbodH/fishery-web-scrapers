113355,addy79,2007-09-13 13:34:00,573,"well put Rico...  there are some very sensitive fishermen on this site, nobody can deny that!!  im surprised the thread hasn't been pulled yet! LOL"
113368,seansmith_smith,2007-09-13 13:56:00,32,"I was a little wary when i first saw the pic, but remembered the previous post explaining it when it was mentioned again.  And the previous post DID explain the giant musky head photo.  Lets hope that people don't start trying to alienate other perfectly responsible, law abiding anglers who chose to share their pictures, stories and experiences with the OFC Community who happen to practice fishing/hunting in a different manner than others by say; - keeping one or more of the dissappearing brook trout populationt eat - posting pictures of several full stringers of walleye, another struggling fish stock in areas - showing a photo of one or more dead deer, bear or moose There are countless scenarios that people may not agree with.  The point of this forum is to share ideas.  If our intent is to change another person's idea about environmental ethics, perhaps we can share our views rather than poopting on someone else's.  I thought the picture AND story about the musky was interesting...especially with the full explanation.  Thanks for sharing Nelly.  Smitty"
113402,lookinforwalleye,2007-09-13 15:14:00,4399,"I think you guys are missing the point I for one did not say anything illegal was done, and it`s not a issue of it being a Musky I would find a Walleye,Bass etc. head just as offensive. I have cleaned numerous fish but I would not think to post pictures of piles of fish heads or entrails what would be the point of that?  I enjoy looking at pictures of people`s catch but I would prefer to see a picture of the whole fish.  Instead of me moving on I think some of you guys need to give your collective head`s a good hard shake!"

Maybe there should be a (weak eyes and stomach) post on the heading...or beheading should I say.. :Gonefishing  Nice fish Nelly. How did the steaks taste anyway? White flakey sweet meat!!!

112945,lew,2007-09-12 12:36:00,12767,"Nelly, as I said in your original post a couple weeks back when you 1st caught that fish, you have absolutely nothing to apoligize for.....NOTHING !!!!!!! You weren't targetting muskies, and there isn't anything you can do to stop one from grabbing your bait, infact it seems 1/2 the muskies caught by members of this board are incidental.  You guys accidently caught 3 muskies that day and successfully released 2 of them, but the last one died on you, even though you tried for 30 minutes to revive her........I wonder how many of our so-called experts would work that hard themselves to try and save a fish.  I've been fishing for muskies for a very long time and have caught   100's of them, infact I landed 110 in 2004 alone, and have definetely had some die on me, and probably alot of others that died after the ""successful"" release. I have alot of $$$$ tied up in release tools and strive to do everything I can to ensure a safe release, but sometimes there's nothing you can do.  Too many folks around here who are unfamiliar with muskies or musky fishing in general are often very quick to criticize others when infact, they have no experience themselves, but often just like to hear themselves talk. Too many people catch 1 or 2 fish and suddenly become experts on everything pertaining to them.  We've lost most of our regular, successful,  musky fishermen from this board over the last couple years, and alot of others, myself included, seldom post musky reports anymore, because of so many negative comments from folks who know little of what they speak.  I hope you enjoyed your experience of catching that big girl Nelly, even though she died on you, but you can feel good with yourself that you at least did everything in your power to revive her, and thanks for taking the time to at least try.......many ""experts"" wouldn't have worked so hard."
112950,Squid,2007-09-12 12:42:00,1656,Good post Lew.
112973,mattyk,2007-09-12 13:54:00,2110,Lew said it very well.
112974,SHAD,2007-09-12 13:55:00,134,"Some dude's on this thread have issues man, lol  Many moons ago I read a biography from an old Musky hunter, can't remember this guy's name but apparently he was a legend.  Would go for weeks on the water in search for trophy's.  I think he was up on Nippissing or the French and he said he was starving, ran out of food, so guess what he caught, ate and survived on, that's right musky.  It's the only thing he said he knew how to catch.  Fishing and eating fish are part of our heritage.  Eat em' all if that's your fancy.  Fish of a thousand casts right, so there will still be plenty for ""non"" purists to catch"
112980,Rich,2007-09-12 14:04:00,3927,"If I were to put up a pic of a musky that size that I had mounted on the wall not near as many would be crying.  It's a fish, not a child. Get over it people.  Nice work nelly."

113103,Beans,2007-09-12 19:51:00,3339,  Nelly...you have been around this board for quite a while and should know that you can't please all the people all the time...I for one was not offended and it seems to me I have seen many muskie heads mounted in my travels over the years...I'm guessing it was a matter of economics and the flesh was eaten and the head mounted as taxidermy does not come cheap...  So keep on posting your pics and don't let the nervous nellies (pun intended) scare you away
113108,mistyjr1,2007-09-12 20:19:00,97," Matt I know that you are quite a successful muskie angler, but for you maybe that may not be considered a trophy, but to another it maybe considered a trophy fish or a fish of a life time. To me a muskie of any size is a trophy to some degree because its not like a bass where you can likely catch more than one in a day.  Corey"
113110,Deano,2007-09-12 20:32:00,767,Some things never change. LOL
113130,fishdawg,2007-09-12 21:14:00,912," dont wanna derail this thread but Darryl had done way more for this province's fishery than many seem to realize - upsets me a lot when i see stuff like this.....  and I also back on Lew 100% on his reply and yes it is a shame that we have lost the contribution of some fine anglers, i dont fault them at all for their decision......"
113134,Crazyhook,2007-09-12 21:38:00,1154,Good post Lew

113142,mcallister.grant,2007-09-12 22:24:00,327,"Well said Lew. Guys and gals, this is getting real old; real fast. He tried to revive the fish; it died; he ate it. I am also curious to know what everyone else who is up in arms about this, would have done with the fish? (Aside from take a picture of the whole thing)"
113152,dmo84,2007-09-12 23:09:00,8,"  Upset you when you see what?  I simply laughed because when I see someone eating fish I instantly think....Darryl Cronzy.  Every show ive ever seen of his the man is taking a break for a shorelunch......he loves to eat fish and does every show that was all.   ""Ohh jeez folks thats a nice one better keep him for a shorelunch"" Hahahaha"
113179,ch312,2007-09-13 00:20:00,1590, exactly! a muskie dies and people get their panties all twisted up. its only a fish  why was the pic removed?
113194,lunkerbasshunter,2007-09-13 00:55:00,2585,musky are great fish no doubt!  But come on? people were really ragging on this guy for eating a fish that died on him? im glad i have been busy with work.  i sure wouldn't have wanted to see that thread.  keep posting nelly!  Cheers!
113206,fishdawg,2007-09-13 01:21:00,912, my appologies to you LOLLH - as i was not reffering to you in particular
113225,stuntman,2007-09-13 02:05:00,96,What happened to the pic?
113238,Rich,2007-09-13 02:46:00,3927,Even if it didn't die he was well within his rights to eat it.

113316,ricoboxing,2007-09-13 11:25:00,398," it was only a picture of a fish head. if you've ever eaten a fish, im sure you've had to cut off the head. i guess deer hunters should not pose with their trophy deer or get the cape mounted, cause some people (especially P3TA treehuggers) may find it offensive.  Nothing illegal was done and this is a fishing forum, so if you don't wanna see a pic of a muskie head, then maybe next time don't click on a topic that says ""Pic of Muskie Head."""
113349,ch312,2007-09-13 13:25:00,1590, so can you please inform me why a picture of a fish on a fishing website is offensive? and here i thought we are suppose to use this site to share our fishing stories and pics. i guess its alright as long as it doesnt involve a dead muskie
113354,Terry,2007-09-13 13:34:00,14456,"there are people showing pictures of their catch all the time here some are dead some are on stringers some are cut up and some are cook some people even have the nerve to show them on a plate about to be eaten .... pictures of fish on a fishing website..who da thunk it if you find  a picture of legally caught fish offensive, it's time to move on  P3TA is looking for people to call their website home"
112749,nelly,2007-09-12 00:09:00,256,I don't know what to say other than to apologize and say Sorry to all the people that I offend.

Feel real bad and wish I could this back....First and last time pics for me.
112751,Gerritt,2007-09-12 00:12:00,6129,nelly.... while your pictures may not have been to somes liking.. I for one an happy that the fish that you could not revive was consumed and not wasted...   Sorry guys.. I may go against popular opinion but those are my thoughts.  Gerritt.

112798,bigfish1965,2007-09-12 01:17:00,3382,"Not eating it would be illegal. So what would you prefer the guy do? IF you fish, some will die.

112817,bigfish1965,2007-09-12 01:58:00,3382," You are correct that if the fish is unedible, then any charge is unlikley. But you would need knowledge of that BEFOREHAND for it to be a defense. Asking  bass fisherman to properly handle and release a musky is like me asking you to optimize the database for this site. Easy once you know how to do it, but if you don't have the experience, you're taking a shot in the dark. If and when you do have a musky not survive, Matt, you are obligated to harvest it provided the fish is in the proper slot. It is a far greater abuse of the resource to leave a legal floater than to not. This fish was legal by all accounts and the knowledge of its toxicity was apparently not on hand. This means the angler did the right and ethical thing. Case closed."
