112804,musky_man,2007-09-12 01:28:00,159,I've musky fished for 35+ years and have yet to lose a fish ... lucky -- maybe... but I have to beleive that some of that has to do with knowing how to handle them.  Do you have the right release tools and a proper net?  Sorry the fish was lost ... hope she was tasty ... better luck next time.
113070,tonyb,2007-09-12 18:35:00,1637,"""I've musky fished for 35+ years and have yet to lose a fish""  I find that hard to believe...nobody can claim that with 100% certainty.  It's a fact that a small percentage of all species of fish suffer post-release mortality, even though they appear to swim away strong.  Kudos to you musky_man, for understanding that certain fish require specialized tools and methods for ensuring greater live-release success.  I don't think there is any point in 'preaching to the choir' in this case as it was an incidental catch, and the fish was captured and consumed according to the provincial fishing regulations.  Tony"
113080,snag,2007-09-12 19:03:00,1932,"Do you still have the head?  Perhaps you could mount it?  Halloweens just around the corner, great mask!  Highdrifter was looking for a musky or pike head to get a tattoo of. I'm not joking!"
113082,Joey,2007-09-12 19:05:00,9122,"I heard of an old trick where you take the head and leave it on the ground in a spot where ants are and they'll take everything off and leave nothing but the bone scull.  You should try that, it would look pretty neat.  Joey"
113127,fishdawg,2007-09-12 21:04:00,912, it was an incidental catch i too had a legal muskie expire on me after it inhaled a small crankbait on me - it never had a chance - i now take a couple of extra measures when I am not targetting muskie too try & prevent it from happening it again
113135,Roy,2007-09-12 21:51:00,13728,"Nelly, it just occurred to me that if you went muskie fishing just once a week, our hit rate would increase by 2%.  I hope that all's well that ends well."
112672,nelly,2007-09-11 21:44:00,256,"Hello everyone. My friend's wife just e-mail me the pics of the muskie on pigeon lake from the labour day weekend. I would like to post it but do not know how. I am NOT good on the computer and do not have a digal cameral or a scanner to do it. If anyone out there would like to help me and don't mind, I will e-mail you the pics 4-5. Just PM me. Thanks alot!"

112697,Weeds,2007-09-11 22:41:00,782,  Wow. I thought you were kidding.
112708,Smokey,2007-09-11 22:53:00,1278,This isn't going to be pretty..............
112710,seansmith_smith,2007-09-11 22:54:00,32,that looks like it could engulf you're entire head!!!....must have been a big one.

112718,mgarre01,2007-09-11 23:00:00,6,Had to edit this post after reading the link.
112720,nelly,2007-09-11 23:01:00,256,"Thanks for all the help! Got to go for supper now and will be back. This is going to take awhile for me.  Joey and all the others, here is the post for this pic. READ this first.  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...mp;#entry108642"
112721,Smokey,2007-09-11 23:02:00,1278,I know I remember the story and he did the right thing by not wasting it but posting the pics will get a rise out of people right or wrong.
112732,solopaddler,2007-09-11 23:28:00,8605,"Hey wicked, I've got a new screensaver! "
112733,solopaddler,2007-09-11 23:31:00,8605,"Seriously though, no reason to doubt the man, he tried to revive it, couldn't, so it was eaten. Well done, and personally the pic doesn't bother me (although it definitely won't be my new screensaver  )"
112735,Dutch,2007-09-11 23:40:00,831,I guess opinions on eating muskie depend on whether an attempt was made to revive the fish (or a pic of the head maybe.....):  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...mp;#entry100362
112737,Joey,2007-09-11 23:42:00,9122,"Nelly, I did read the previous post.  Its just that a pic like that on a musky dominant board is not likely go go over well and people like myself might not see the point of posting it.  Kind of breaks your heart that's all.  Joey"
112738,snagmaster,2007-09-11 23:43:00,250,thats to bd the fish died but atleast you guys ate it...why would you post that pic tho?? guys on here dont like to see percious musky like that and niether do I
112742,Sinker,2007-09-11 23:51:00,8692,Good god.....get over it already people. Its a dead musky.....caught incidentally.....it died.....he ate it...end of story.  Life goes on.....  Sinker
112744,mgarre01,2007-09-11 23:55:00,6,  People get that. It's the head shot that's unsettling.
112745,Whopper,2007-09-11 23:59:00,2174,"I with Smokey and Joey on this one, no need to post the pic period.  Bad taste in my book!  You don't see other people posting beheaded pics of walleye, bass or even perch heads.   Whopper"
112746,Sinker,2007-09-12 00:00:00,8692, I think its safe to say we're all fisher people on here.  Never cleaned a fish before? Its just another fish head........  A lot of people seem to get a little over excited when it comes to a dead musky.  Sinker
