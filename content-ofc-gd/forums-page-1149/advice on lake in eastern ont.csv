I do not mind going to a lodge or resort, but am happy with a hotel. Equipment - 14' motorized canoe, pole. My wife will be with me so i am hoping the THIS TIME I can catch more than her. Species is not important, just good eating! Bass, pickerel, pike, or even good size panfish are fine. Thank you in advance."
