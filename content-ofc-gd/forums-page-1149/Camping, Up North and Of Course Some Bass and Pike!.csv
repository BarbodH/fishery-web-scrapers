112361,Minnow,2007-09-11 06:03:00,177,Hey Guys  Here is an early season pike I caught on the a pink x-rap in the moon river area! Caught about 5 pike that size and a couple bass by accident but all were  released    Then me and a couple friends headed up to Net lake in the Temagami area and hooked into some nice smallies and a couple pike            Found this guy all alone in the middle of the lake! Almost hit him with the boat saw the beaver dam by the shore so gave him a lift to safety!    Went camping near Killbear Provincial Park and hooked some of these nice bass on Flipping Jigs! All of them in about 5 feet of water around logs      And of course the Worlds Greatest Sport Fish! The always great fighter the rock bass!

112870,Minnow,2007-09-12 05:03:00,177,"Sorry guys for posting the first too pics of the largies, I forgot the policy of no OOS fish! Hope I didn't offend anyone won't happen again and took the pics down! We were actually targeting pike with my grandpa in a small inlet of moon river and happened to hook these two nice buckets by accident. I can assure you that they were quickly released! I put up the pike picture instead it is not as big as the bass but I can assure you it is in season! Sorry once again and I hope that the beaver pic is not an OOS catch will check the regs but he was a live release LOL!"
