112662,love2fishhave2work,2007-09-11 21:15:00,212,I was in NY about 20 blocks away on 9 11.  Tough to think about it.
112669,Lostchild,2007-09-11 21:31:00,153,"The Towers seem to be the thing that sticks out most in everybody's mind, (for obvious reasons) but let's not forget the attack on the Pentagon and the hero's ""flight 93."" God bless!"

112839,Rattletrap2,2007-09-12 02:37:00,1652,Thanks for the reminder Roy. I'll never forget the look in my Friends eyes when I told him what had happened. He was up helping us out here... doing some teaching... from his home in North Carolina.
112850,oxcowboy,2007-09-12 03:08:00,544,"i am 33 and 9-11 is easily the most tragic day in history of my life, i was teaching a class of 9th graders when we first heard the news,  it was hard to try and explain to them what was exactly going on,  i am proud to say that one of those students in that very class is now in the marines and is headed to iraq in about 3 weeks, i had a chance to talk to him this past weekend, and we recalled some of the things that happened that day.  i thanked him in advance for what he is about to do, and i am very proud of the man he has become.  please dont ever forget all that have gave their lives to defend the freedoms that we have, and also please thank all that have served to help keep it that way.  jason"
112855,holdfast,2007-09-12 03:11:00,1813,"Yea I remember clearly as I was standing on top of a truck camming it up when one of the guys announced it.  It was only the next day when it became clear to what happened when the Commanding Officer announced on Role call to 500 plus troops what had happened.  Even that early he announced that one of our closest allies and friends had been attacked and we would be fighting a war and an Enemy that would be Brutal and unconventional.  It wasn't long afterwards that General Hilliar revamped the forces to fight the way we fight now as a total force concept.  So far hes done a great job that should make everybody proud.  We have such a small force but do so much that we have always been the envy of all our allies.  I know first hand with my experience in Iraq/Kuwait, Croatia, Bosnia, and Macedonia and our cross training with the Americans and Brits.  Buy them a coffee and support them  Thanks"

The Innocent suffered hell's inferno, A senseless act that goes unforgotton, how could they? They will pay....

Out of the ashes came a tempting vengence But we are focused, we seek redemption, We are free, We'll stay free..

112878,dsn,2007-09-12 08:18:00,1018,Out of all the days of my life I can't remember what I was doing. But when 9/11 happened I can recall what I was doing that only day and where I was exactly when it took place. Weird.
112999,POLLIWOGG,2007-09-12 14:59:00,835,I wonder what they planned on doing with those nuke cruise missals  the other day? Was the attack called off or just saber rattling?
113150,ecxstriper,2007-09-12 23:03:00,343,Great topic Roy . I live 10 miles from ground 0 I wasn't here in 2001 but I have met many people who where on site and lost family there. While the site is being rebuilt the damaged and loss still effects famiiies  here.   The thing to remeber is love your family and be kind to one another .  Thanks again Roy
112402,Roy,2007-09-11 11:14:00,13728,"It was six years ago this morning. I just like for people to remember what a tragic day that was and the innocent people who died. I don't like political type threads but I think that it's good to remember and think about what really happened on our soil, North America, six years ago. This thread just serves ar a reminder. If it goes awry, it's gone."
112403,Greencoachdog,2007-09-11 11:17:00,8163,Thanks for remembering Roy.
112404,motv8tr,2007-09-11 11:23:00,2587,Hard to forget something like that...good reminder though  maureen
112407,fatherof3,2007-09-11 11:33:00,1769,something we should never forget
112410,ccmtcanada,2007-09-11 11:38:00,7971,A day that will be with me forever.  Never forget.
112412,pigeonfisher,2007-09-11 11:41:00,696,"That day was the beginning of a new generation.  In our history we have never been able to look at ONE DAY that set the pace for what the next generation will have to look for.  That was it!  Keep safe, everyone.  Remember those that we lost."
112414,silveradosheriff,2007-09-11 11:42:00,1025,God bless.
112415,mcallister.grant,2007-09-11 11:45:00,327,It is a day that changed the way we carry on our life. My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected.
112419,Joey,2007-09-11 11:49:00,9122,"Yes, I think we were ALL affected on way or another by the tragic events of that day.  Thanks for reminding us Roy.  Joey"
112425,John,2007-09-11 12:05:00,2956,"A day in history that changed all of our lives forever. Great post Roy........  I was at Heathrow Airport early on 9/11/01 and will never, ever forget that feeling as the BBC news broadcast the attack. It took me 4 days to get back to Toronto Pearson. While frustrated, I felt very proud that through the turmoil and confusion some 3,000 odd miles away, Canadians were volunteering their seats to get returning Americans back home, through Canada to be with their loved ones...  John..."
112427,Terry,2007-09-11 12:07:00,14456,this day changed our lives for ever...
112433,Guest gbfisher,2007-09-11 12:25:00,0,I remember. Only a few hours from now watching TV with one tower all ready burning and not knowing why....then the other tower was taken out!!  Not a good day but one worth remembering.
112434,Deano,2007-09-11 12:28:00,767,God bless and be safe everyone.
112437,Guest mistyriver1,2007-09-11 12:33:00,0,Nice post Roy.
112443,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-11 12:44:00,698,"I long for the way life was before 9/11, everything seemed so carefree. The world changed that day and I hope one day we will be carefree again. Today I will remember the victims, the families and the heroes of 9/11.  Not only did 9/11 bring out the worst of our society but it also brought out the best, one can't forget the rescue workers who risked and lost their lives as well as the Canadian families who lent a hand and help stranded passengers in newfoundland."
112490,OhioFisherman,2007-09-11 14:44:00,6623,A cowardly attack done by madmen.
112494,Moosebunk,2007-09-11 14:51:00,3970,"There were 4 of us on a 110km canoe route through Temagami.  It was final day of the 8 day trip when we paddled into the access point of the lake.  Having not had contact with the world in a week a fella up to us when we landed and told us of the attack on the towers.  My response... ""Yeah right, you probably tell that to all the trippers you see coming back.""  Awhile later when finally in the car the radio was turned on and the news was everywhere.  It was a really weird feeling I remember."
112498,davew3,2007-09-11 15:02:00,430,That was the day when our armed forces became committed to the fight against terror.  To this day men and women are still dying due to that terrible attack.  And many more are dying from illnesses from trying to rescue others.  Do not let anyone forget !
112501,Headhunter,2007-09-11 15:11:00,5703,There are few days that everyone can remember where they were when something happened... this is one. My thoughts to all who died and survived this terrible day. HH
112525,Jen,2007-09-11 15:48:00,833,"I stood watching the television with my four year old as the second plane flew into the buildings... he looked at me and said, ""Is this a movie Mommy?""  Thank you for the reminder Roy!!  God Bless!  Jen"
112526,lew,2007-09-11 15:50:00,12767,"The day after the attack, I was watching CNN and they were reporting from some Middle Eastern country......don't remember now which one and it doesn't really matter I spose......and it showed the people rejoycing in the street and celebrating the attack.  Then the camera moved to show a small girl about 5 years old, dancing and cheering and singing because they'd murdered so many innocent people.  I'll never forget that scene and it almost made me cry to think that a small child could be taught such hatred at such a young age, and she didn't even know why she hated an entire civilization, but was so happy that so many had died.  In a couple years she'll probably be one of the suicide bombers......so very sad......"
112528,TJQ,2007-09-11 15:57:00,7806,I stood there this summer...  I will never forget.
112582,blaque,2007-09-11 18:19:00,2419,"The towers were about 400 miles from my home outside of Buffalo. At the time i had never been there. New York city always seemed SOOOO far away........but when i watched what was happening on TV at work, in the cafeteria where all the people i worked with were just staring in silence.............i thought, man this is just right down the street that this act of war is taking place, as we spoke, as we sat there and watched it, we were being invaded no more than a 6-1/2 hour car ride from where we were. . It made it seem so much closer. Ive since been to New York City and its even spookier that i can be up at 6 AM and be in the area that this all happened by lunch time. I remember the guy in the cubicle next to me who always listened to headphones say a small plane ""ran into "" the trade center.......and remember pretty much every step of the news getting worse, and then going to the cafe to watch, and the second plane hitting, and everyone just looked at each other like it clicked instantly, this was happening on purpose. Just surreal........not one person at their desks, not one phone ringing, not one boss worrying about us getting back to work. Just everyone staring at this screen in awe. It was chilling, saddening, infuriating, and hard to believe at the same time. One of the most disgusting things ive ever witnessed."
112593,danbo,2007-09-11 18:39:00,2646,"Grieving is a painful process..hopefully the gift for us all, that were spared that terror, will be to live in peace & harmony now."
112649,Tarzan's Jane,2007-09-11 21:02:00,1183,I was on a picket line...someone had a radio...the sense that something beyond tragic was happening and the fear of not knowing how much more was going to take place was enough for me to put down my sign and say to heck with my fight for a 2% increase....I had to get home.  You just don't ever forget such horror.
