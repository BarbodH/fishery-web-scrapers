My clients were very happy because between the 4 of them they must of hooked 30+ fish...  The largest being somewhere in the high 20's  Broke in the new RAVEN MATRIX XL  float reel,  perfect reel for salmon with a larger diamiter it was great...  Also tried my new RAVEn IM9 15ft as well    What a backbone...

Any other fishing spots from shore?  Is Ashbridges Bay OK or are the fish heading up the rivers?  May try the humber. balsamj
