Saw a few jump but no takers.Cast out one last time and got a solid hit.Line takes off and fight is on.To make a long story short this one fought like crazy and took a while to come in.    I didn't have a scale but he measured around 26 inches.Was wondering if anyone can take a rough guess as to what the weight might be? This is my 5th big fish in 4 days from this spot,not back for being a 5 minute walk from my house.Hope this one shows up as my first post did not."

I'm lousy at guessing sizes but there's a calculator here: http://www.bassresource.com/bassfishing/fishcalculator.html (no idea how good it is) that says a 26"" carp should be around 10 pounds"
