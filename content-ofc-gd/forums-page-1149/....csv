113019,Roy,2007-09-12 16:04:00,13728,"Very entertaining, Bubba. That sheepie looks albino. That blue is CLEAN. That Bozo story was hilarious. It would have been much funnier if you'd had a fishing partner with you. Great stuff!"
113025,Mike the Pike,2007-09-12 16:20:00,3421,Thanks for laughs about the BOZO's Glen.At least you where not skunked man you must of held in alot laughing at the launch and let it out later.  Mike
113030,Whopper,2007-09-12 16:48:00,2174,Good report Glen.  I've got a question though....did you retire or what?  Cheers  Whopper
113032,Sherriff,2007-09-12 17:03:00,252,Always a good time watching at the launch.  I sometimes eat my lunch down at the launch just for the good times.  It is amazing how difficult people make it.  Everyone should get their system down and do it by themselves to make it more efficient.  Always seems the idiots that cannot launch properly are the ones who could care less about anyone else waiting..  Good report too....  Sherriff
113034,Joey,2007-09-12 17:12:00,9122,"Thanks for the chuckle of the day G.  Great fun at the launch today I see  Beanee Weenee's, yummm, and cold too, even better  Joey"
113036,Terry,2007-09-12 17:15:00,14456,and I thought those guys only use the ramps I'm at......Bozoisum  is universal I see
113041,Headhunter,2007-09-12 17:30:00,5703,"Sounds like you were fishin ""Clown Lake""! LOL Thanks for the laugh, it was a good read. HH"
113047,Rizzo,2007-09-12 17:40:00,4754,"Great report, especially enjoyed the launch story.  When I get too old to fish, somebody please park my sorry arse at a launch (preferably a shallow, gravel launch) so I can watch the fun one last time.  ...oh ya nearly forgot...mmmmmm twinkies"
113052,wallyboss,2007-09-12 17:45:00,1095,For about 3 years my boat was upside down on a utility trailer with the motor in a wooden box on the trailer.  I used to fish on week days or at night  so I wouldn't be in peoples way.  And even with that setup putting my 14footer in and out of the water by myself I was probably faster than a lot of those Bozo's. Now I have a boat trailer and I'm in and out under 4 minutes  5 if high winds.
113058,fatherof3,2007-09-12 17:57:00,1769,"that was an amusing read,thanks for sharing"
113064,SlowPoke,2007-09-12 18:03:00,2984,"When the Bozo's are on the ramp if you listen really well, you can hear the Mission Impossible theme. P.S. Try the pink worm of death. You can thank me later. -Brian"
113078,aplumma,2007-09-12 18:51:00,6896,"Let's see when I went fishin Saturdays lunch on the boat was bean dip with scoops corn chips, ritz crackers with vienna sausages and cold beer. I had to fire up the engines 1/2 hour later so I could breath I had some stinky people on board after lunch. So my question is did you eat the Twinkie or use it like a muffler????   Art"
113095,wolfville,2007-09-12 19:37:00,396,"Nice read....but, what happened to that 'thing'? Did you get an extra for your motor? LOL"
113137,lookinforwalleye,2007-09-12 21:59:00,4399,"I seem to recall the first time I launched my boat it was a bit of an adventure, I am sure glad you guys were not there to document my first launch."
113147,PERCHER,2007-09-12 22:46:00,787,Now that was funny.All the Bozos seem to hang out at boat ramps for some reason.
113287,Marc Thorpe,2007-09-13 08:46:00,621,"""This is the preferred lunch of athletic fishermen throughout the deep south!""  You keep eating those things and the mods will make you wear a shirt when posting  Just think about it Glen,you rib cage will disapear"
113288,Rich Clemens,2007-09-13 09:27:00,3131,Great report Glen.  Always nice to have a little entertainment glad you kept your cool on such a warm day.
113291,Spiel,2007-09-13 09:47:00,9065,"....Ah the tales of ""boat laaunch bozos"", often the highlight of many a trip. Always entertaining even if they be making me wait to launch. Good tale Glen, or would that be tail."
113312,Daplumma,2007-09-13 11:22:00,1961,Pepsi and a Twinkie!!??I had you pegged for a Moon Pie and RC cola kinda guy!Nice report bud. Joe
113325,dustink,2007-09-13 12:15:00,526,"Nice report...thanks for the laugh...  I just shook my head and told older Bozo ""I hate when that happens""! LOL..that's funny...."
113372,ccmtcanada,2007-09-13 14:03:00,7971,"LOL Glen...had me laughing out loud at the office!!  I dont have a boat, but have seen people...good and bad at boat launches.  A boat is in my future at some point...I just pray that you are not around to witness it....would hate to have it featured here on OFC.....LOL"
113433,wuchikubo,2007-09-13 17:47:00,1114,"Glen, what a read!  You should bring a video cam next time, it sounds like something for the TV!  Looks like a white crappie. I'm so used to seeing black crappie, it was a treat.  Marinas should have lessons for first timers, that MAY have helped a bit. Maybe not sometimes.  Thanks for the read."
