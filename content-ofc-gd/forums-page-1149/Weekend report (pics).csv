Went with friend to my favored lake. At six am was still dark and pretty windy so we put boat adrift and started casting . By 7 am we’ve landed 3 pikes. Action slowed down little bit, so we’ve moved to the other part of the lake. More pikes and some bass. Then I’ve had my best hour ever  . It started with 27” pike, then chunky walleye, then my biggest to date LM bass ( 4.5 lb). On the end I’ve lost something BIG  in the weeds under the boat.  When I’ve pulled out J11 rapala from the water, two points of the back treble were almost straight. On the end we’ve landed 10 pikes ( lost four), five LM, walleye and this mystery  brute I did not have a chance to see.  Few pics         "
