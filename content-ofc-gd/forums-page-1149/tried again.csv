The weather was ok when we arrived.A little overcast and calm.    But quickly turned to this.       Needless to say this put an end to our night as there was a lot of lightning as well.Sorry for the quality on some of the pics but I was walking trying to avoid getting caught in it.It didn't work as we were soaked all the way home.Hopefully will have a better report tomorrow."
