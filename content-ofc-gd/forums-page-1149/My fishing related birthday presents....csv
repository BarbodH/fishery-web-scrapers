113153,ccmtcanada,2007-09-12 23:11:00,7971,"Thanks everyone who wished me a happy birthday on the thread that Alex started today.  Anyhow, just wanted to share a few things I got for my birthday!!  I did get a new medium heavy rod, fast action yesterday....I landed that salmon with it last night.  Here's the other stuff I got.  If I'm going to try and get some nice Quinte Walleye for the OFC G2G in November...I'll need this stuff!!!  A Shimano trolling rod and an Okuma Magda Pro reel with line counter.  I know it's not high end stuff, but I'll realistically only be using it a few times a year in big waters.   I also got this stuff a few weeks ago...but it was an early birthday present....  Minnkota 30lb thrust Trolling motor....   And deep cycle marine battery with dual mode (10A and 2A) automatic charger.   Anyhow...my family rules...they sure know what to get me dont they??  Now...I gotta go fishing...hopefully a report later, but 4 nights in a row of catching salmon may be a bit too much to ask...but come on...it's my birthday right????  LOL."
