112700,Dozer,2007-09-11 22:47:00,896,"Okay, so I've outfitted myself with a pretty decent setup for trout / salmon fishing.  Got myself an 11 foot rod with a reel spooled with 10 lbs test braided line.  Gonna go to Whitby marina today and fish the canal.  So I've picked up a few spoons from Crappy Tire and I've got a question about the Little Cleo's in particular.  I purchased a few glow in the dark cleo's but my question is about setting them up to my line.  Some other spoons I've purchased came with little ""rings"" where I guess I tie my line to.  However, the Cleo's dont have any rings, just a hole on the top of the spoon.  Do I just tie my line to the ""hole""?  Any other tips would be appreciated.  Hopefully I'll come back with a few pictures  Thanks"
112709,Raf,2007-09-11 22:54:00,3495, The spoon will twist your line pretty good.  I would suggest at least a quality snap swivel and attaching the lure to it.  A mono or fluoro leader with a good swivel on one end and a snap on the other would be a good idea too.

112773,addict,2007-09-12 00:44:00,475,if u dont use a swivel u get mega line twist if u hook one without a swivel the line will snap because the edges on that hole are rough found that out the hard way ice fishing many moons ago
112787,Garyv,2007-09-12 00:58:00,547,"I add split rings to all my Salmon and Rainbow spoons and terminate to the main line with a good quality cross lock snap with swivel.  I also find that I get better hook ups with swash hooks instead of trebles.  Cleo's in our area are great for bows, and Shore fisherman use them all the time."
