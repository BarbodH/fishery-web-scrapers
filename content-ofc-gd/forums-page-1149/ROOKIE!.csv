Twenty minutes in im in a complete daydream while drifting a pool that is very clearly full of salmon, smart move eh? As im looking at the opposite bank i think to myself, self, you should probably look for your float. So I look for my float, hey, float, where are you!? This process takes aout 7-8 seconds to register in my dozed state, and it is the sight of a beautiful brown trout rocketing out of the water towards me with my roe in its yap that brings me back to reality. CRAP! So i reel in the slack like a madman, but I already knew this move was in vain and I was right as the brown threw my roe bag and dissapeared back into the depths.  I thought it was a little early for browns myself, but if there is some in there ill be breakin out the 4 lb leaders and tiny hooks because id rather drift trout than salmon any day!   Thought id share what NOT to do while drifting..."

113067,kemper,2007-09-12 18:14:00,2232,"Thats definatly a respectable brown!  This one was in the 8 pound range, and im still kicking myself for not being prepared. Its ok though, I had a little chat with the river and told mr. brown that i would be back tonight and not be so forgiving."
