112512,Jen,2007-09-11 15:24:00,833,"I read your reports and they always and I mean always make me so very happy.  You guys are doing so well in your quest for fish this year... WELL done!  Cheers,  Jen"
112527,LeXXington,2007-09-11 15:53:00,1928,"Great going. There are bigger ones out there Bly time will come and watch out  I love fall casting for the big ones,  Even having a boat in the fall I sometimes just go out of range where the peir casters are Drop the anchor and cast away from the boat. Hard to describe the power of a hit at high speed.  look forward to more posts and bigger fish"
112644,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-11 20:48:00,0,Nice Salmon!!! They are great fighters though the crowds can be too much at times!
112778,addict,2007-09-12 00:50:00,475,nice fish cliff.i seen bly at the tackle store today she said she broke her rod fighting one of those brutes.beats carp fishing hands down keep those posts coming.
112842,Douger,2007-09-12 02:42:00,116,"congrats on the pb, cliff.  you must have been stoked to hammer a hard-fightin' fresh one!  -d-"
112326,ccmtcanada,2007-09-11 03:00:00,7971,"Wow...that's all I can say.  Bly and I headed out again tonight...me in search of my second salmon from shore and she awaiting her first.  We got there at around 8pm...the sun was going down and there were quite a lot of people around.  This time, I didn't bother experimenting with crank baits and went straight to tossing my spoon.  About 45 minutes in (exactly 24 hours since I hooked my first one last night), I have a HUGE hit.  Quickly set the hook and the fight is on!!!  This one took off on a few hard runs, but I felt a little more confident and thumbed the spool as she started to run towards some snags in the water.  I thought I had lost her at one point...the line went completely slack....so I started to reel as fast as I could.  Wouldn't you know it...she was almost right in front of me!!  She took off on a few more quick runs, but she couldn't escape the net!!  Here she is...a real beauty and my new personal best.  She measured in at 38"" in length and came in at 18.5 pounds.  This also beats the current best for team 6!! We have a new entry in the OFC tourney.   After removing the hook, I looked in amazement...she completely destroyed the trebles and her teeth did a number on the paint.   I quickly replaced the trebles and started casting out again.  Apparently, my rod was no match for two powerful salmon as the tip broke off on my next cast out there.  We continued fishing...Bly had a few solid hits, but she was unlucky and didn't end up fighting one.  Her time will come...and you just know it...she'll beat my PB length by an inch and weight by a pound.  That's ok...I'm used to it now...between the two of us, she has the largest steelhead and walleye....LOL.  Anyhow....pretty tired...need sleep.  I'm still pumped....."

112444,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-11 12:46:00,698,Nice job! It sucks living in the east end. I have to wait until shore fishing at Bluffers heats up.
112450,ccmtcanada,2007-09-11 12:56:00,7971,"Thanks everyone....my goal this year was to catch one salmon that qualifies for an OFAH award.  This fish made it by a mere 2 inches.  If I dont catch another one this year, then I'll be very content with the successes I've already had....  now.....   I WANNA BIG MUSKIE!!!!!!! LOL"
112485,fishnsled,2007-09-11 14:31:00,3520,I told you it wouldn't be long before you broke your PB from the other night.  CONGRATS!!!  We'll see what we can do about the muskie when we get out.
112488,tbayboy,2007-09-11 14:37:00,1497,"Congrats Cliff and I'm sure your right - Bly is just letting your ego climb a bit so she can drop it that much further with her 40"" 20lber tonight .  Hmm now I'm gonna have to learn all about this salmon shore fishing stuff - when's payday or as I now call it ""give bass pro all my money day""?"
