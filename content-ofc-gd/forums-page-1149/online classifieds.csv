I have some sites I visit (including this one) and hope to get some more leads on where to look.  This is what I have so far.  Kijiji.com craigslist.org Buysellzone.com http://forums.fishontario.com/thread.jspa?...43&tstart=0 Here of course.  any more places I should be looking?   I have only found 2 places to put a hitch on my vehicle Uhaul and Canadian Tire.  Canadian Tire was gouging and Uhal......well I am a bit leary.  The 3 local mechanics dont do this.  Anyone know of a place east of TO that is good?  Stuntman"

107444,mugsmuffin,2007-08-25 04:50:00,17,Jensen trailers on Bloor St. in Oshawa or if there is Krown Rust Control they could help you out.
107460,Corey,2007-08-25 10:57:00,355,"What area do you live in? There are lots of places in or around hamilton. I personally go to The Hitchman on the hill just above Grimsby. Good people there, good prices."
107505,stuntman,2007-08-25 16:04:00,96,"Man, everything seems to be out near Hamilton!  I live in Whitby"
107581,Sinker,2007-08-25 20:59:00,8692,"Van and Truck world in oshawa should be able to help you out. Jenson trailers as well on bloor....If you want to go as far as the 115, there are a couple places there that will do it. Can't think of the names for some reason though....."
107644,boatman,2007-08-26 00:16:00,350,Van and Truck World (Hamilton) did my hitch. They were good and cheaper than most. CTC and UHAUL are way overpriced.
113214,stuntman,2007-09-13 01:41:00,96,"Thanks to boatman I checked out Van and Truck World in Oshawa for my hitch installation  I got a class 1 ""hidden hitch"" brand installed with wiring.  Unlike CT and Uhaul they were not gouging me.  I checked out Jensens on Bloor as well.  It took a couple of installers 45 min to install for 1.5 hours labour.  CT was quoting 2+1/2 hours and they were not the most expensive.  I don't have a trailer to test the wiring yet but Van and Truck World does a ton of hitches so I am confident all will be good.  I would recommend them to anyone (who I like   )   Stuntman"
