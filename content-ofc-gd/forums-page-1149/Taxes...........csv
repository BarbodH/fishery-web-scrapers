112438,John,2007-09-11 12:35:00,2956,"As some of you may know, I lost my Dad recently. My sister and I have been dealing with never ending layers of bureaucracy. Inheritance taxes in the UK are somewhat brutal once the estate is valued over a certain amount. I have always been of the opinion that the more tax I pay the more income I have therefore not it's necessarily a terribly bad thing...............however.........  I got the following in my e-mail this morning and had the usual chuckle. I don't typically pass these things along as a matter of course, but as I continued to read I realized that this is very close to my heart. If you read the whole thing, it's very close to reality!    Tax his land,  Tax his bed,  Tax the table  At which he's fed.    Tax his tractor,  Tax his mule,  Teach him taxes  Are the rule.    Tax his cow,  Tax his goat,  Tax his pants,  Tax his coat.    Tax his ties,  Tax his shirt,  Tax his work,  Tax his dirt.    Tax his tobacco,  Tax his drink,  Tax him if he  Tries to think.    Tax his cigars,  Tax his beers,  If he cries, then  Tax his tears.    Tax his car,  Tax his gas,  Find other ways  To tax his ass    Tax all he has  Then let him know  That you won't be done  Till he has no dough.    When he screams and hollers,  Then tax him some more,  Tax him till  He's good and sore.    Then tax his coffin ,  Tax his grave,  Tax the sod in  Which he's laid.    Put these words  upon his tomb,  "" Taxes drove me to my doom...""    When he's gone,  Do not relax,  Its time to apply  The inheritance tax.    Accounts Receivable Tax  Building Permit Tax  CDL license Tax  Cigarette Tax  Corporate Income Tax  Dog License Tax  Excise Taxes  Federal Income Tax  Federal Unemployment Tax  Fishing License Tax  Food License Tax  Fuel Permit Tax  Gasoline Tax  Gross Receipts Tax  Hunting License Tax  Inheritance Tax  Inventory Tax  Liquor Tax  Luxury Taxes  Marriage License Tax  Medicare Tax  Personal Property Tax  Property Tax  Real Estate Tax  Service Charge Tax  Social Security Tax  Road Usage Tax  Sales Tax  Recreational Vehicle Tax  School Tax  Income Tax  Unemployment Tax  Telephone Federal Excise Tax  Telephone Federal Universal Service Fee Tax  Telephone Federal, State and Local Surcharge Taxes  Telephone Minimum Usage Surcharge Tax  Telephone Recurring and Non-recurring Charges Tax  Telephone Provincial and Local tax  Telephone Usage Charge Tax  Utility Taxes  Vehicle License Registration Tax  Vehicle Sales Tax  Watercraft Registration Tax  Well Permit Tax  Workers Compensation Tax    STILL THINK THIS IS FUNNY?  Not one of these taxes existed less than 100 years ago, and our nation was the one of the most prosperous in the world. We had absolutely no national debt, had the largest middle class in the world, and Mom typically stayed home to raise the kids.    What the hell happened?"

112446,Deano,2007-09-11 12:48:00,767,"And when there taxed out, start charging for services not rendered. Pay for phone minutes, even if not used. Pay for delivery charge and storage of electricity and natural gas above what gas and electricity is actually used. Pay for 100's of channels although only one is watched at a time. Pay more to not have chemicals in your food.  Guaranteeing most will never be able to retire, this way you'll always keep working to pay more taxes. Welcome to freedom."
112453,fatherof3,2007-09-11 13:02:00,1769,so true
112458,bigbuck,2007-09-11 13:08:00,2449,"Way back when, all the government did for you was provide laws and some protection ie. army, navy and police and the like. Now, we have nice roads (for the most part, I can remember a lot of dirt roads and I'm in my mid '30s), healthcare, welfare, all sorts of other 'fares, etc... It has to get paid for and with the multiple layers of bureaucracy, lots of cash gets eaten up along the way. I've heard about how crazy the UK is for inheritance taxes. We moan here and the Probate fees are roughly 15 basis points ($15k on a $1million estate), + whatever investments there are outside of the house are taxed appropriately, still, not too bad of a deal if you do a proper estate plan which will cost you a few dollars but will save a ton for your heirs."
112474,Guest gbfisher,2007-09-11 13:33:00,0,"The saying you can't take it with you applies even after yer dead.  ""roughly 15 basis points ($15k on a $1million estate"")  Its a good thing that the person who died had enough to cover his death bill.  It sucks in a BIG WAY! ..........but its the price we pay to live where we want."
112476,Joey,2007-09-11 13:39:00,9122,"Oh, and lets not forget to tax the debt reduction charge on our electricity bill, which is neither a good nor a service  Joey"
112480,OhioFisherman,2007-09-11 14:20:00,6623,"The high price of freedom? You can live where you want, go where you want, buy what you want, LOL if you have enough money left after taxes! Oops scratch, Cuba! Like they say the only sure things in life are death and taxes."

112911,OhioFisherman,2007-09-12 11:15:00,6623,"A little boy wanted $100.00 to buy a new bike very badly and prayed for weeks, but nothing happened. Then he decided to write God a letter requesting the $100.00. When The postal authorities received the letter to God, USA, they decided to send it to the President. The president was so amused that he instructed his secretary to send the little boy a $5.00 bill. The president thought this would appear to be a lot of money to a little boy. The little boy was delighted with the $5.00 bill and sat down to write a thank-you note to God, which read: Dear God: Thank you very much for sending the money. However, I noticed that for some reason you sent it through Washington, DC., and those *******s deducted $95.00 in taxes. __________________"
