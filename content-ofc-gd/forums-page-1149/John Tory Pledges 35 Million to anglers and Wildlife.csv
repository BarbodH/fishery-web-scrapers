112558,Headhunter,2007-09-11 17:09:00,5703,"I had every intention of voting for the PC's, simply due to my disgust for Dalton and his boys! However, I now find myself in a real challenging position as I simply cannot vote for anyone who wants to fund religious based schools, with public money. IMHO-  we should not fund any faith based schools, and yes I do also mean the Catholic School boards as well. As this county becomes more and more ethnically diverse, we do need some kind of glue to hold us together, and separating our children based on religion is not the solution. Thant leaves me with the choices of NDP or Green and that's why I'm having a really hard time! Rhino's anyone!?LOL HH"
112560,ccmtcanada,2007-09-11 17:14:00,7971,HH - I loved the Rhino Party back in the 80's....paying down the debt with an american express card....LOL.  Pure genius.
112566,Headhunter,2007-09-11 17:27:00,5703,CLiff... I left out the Marijuana Party because I don't think they exist any more. That or they are all out gettin munchies some where!LOL HH
112599,tonyb,2007-09-11 18:47:00,1637,"On another board, John Tory actually spent a day fishing with Darryl Chronzey.  Now if any of you know anything about Darryl, you know that he speaks his mind and stands by his word.  He put John Tory through the wringer, sending a barrage of fishery related questions at him.  In the end, Chronzey was impressed, and truly believes that if elected John Tory will follow through on his promises.  (See the latest issue of Ontario Out of Doors, it has an election special with each platforms position on our hot natural resource based topics)  I responded to that thread stating this:  ""...it may be just politics, but for once fishing and hunting is getting into politics. ""  Agreed, If I am going to vote for a liar, at least the liar I vote for will have mentioned the word 'fish'...  And before you all jump on me for calling them liars, I mean it in a political sense, as in they won't keep all their pre-election promises.  So what the heck, I'll go out on a limb this year and vote for the guy who went fishing with Darryl  Tony"
112603,Squid,2007-09-11 19:10:00,1656,THIS IS A POLITICAL THREAD AND AS SUCH SHOULD BE LOCKED OR PULLED.
112618,Mike Pike,2007-09-11 19:55:00,1332,"Tory isn't a liar because he's a politician.  He's a liar because he's a fisherman!  lol  Sorry couldn't resist.  I'm still undecided, btw."
112629,SlowPoke,2007-09-11 20:13:00,2984,"Tory has my vote. IMO there is a difference between leaders and politicians. It's not often we get a chance to vote for a party with a true leader at the helm. Mike Harris was a leader and I voted for him. The difference is making the right decisions as unpopular as they may be.  I'm predominantly Liberal believing in the most amount of good for the most amount of people. I held my nose and voted for Eaves last time around - only because he was slightly less slimey than McGuinty and we knew what he was all about. (the devil you know...)  As for the school issue, we've been funding the Catholic School board with public money for as long as I can remember. How do we deny other religeons of funding when our population is based on immigration? I'd rather see non-secular school funding but the horse is already out of the barn.  -Brian"
112633,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-11 20:18:00,698,  You might be right Squid. I just started the thread to talk about MNR funding. It may be starting to get a little off track
112646,Pigeontroller,2007-09-11 20:57:00,2793,I think this thread is quite civil and should be left alone! This is an important issue that effects us all in our common interest of fishing!
112663,Squid,2007-09-11 21:19:00,1656,"Ok, then don't discuss the way someone is going to vote or breaking promises etc.. keep it on topic."
112831,Golfisher,2007-09-12 02:19:00,586,"I doubt there are enough people in Ontario who would base their vote solely on the pledge that any party makes regarding MNR funding to make any difference in terms of the actual election outcome.  There are a lot more and bigger fish to fry; compared to education, health, or fiscal policy, MNR funding is a none-issue for most voters.  I guarantee you that the majority of Ontarians don't even know what MNR stands for!"
112832,aniceguy,2007-09-12 02:24:00,1094,3 million sure do know the OMNR as they do buy a liscence to fish in this province
112910,DT10Sam,2007-09-12 11:15:00,480,"HHHhhhhmmmmmmmmmmmm.............let's see I own a fishing and hunting store (lots of guns)  MCGuinty wants to ban guns and does not care for hunters......does he even fish hhhhhhmmmmmmmmm..........He is a LIEBERAL oh well I never voted for him and he has not swayed me that way either.  I guess he is not the logical choice.  Regards, Sam"
112246,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-10 23:56:00,698,"Saw this posted over at the OFAH website. What do you guys think, legit or lip service?  http://www.ofah.org/GetPDF.cfm?ID=News/Joh...etter090107.pdf"
112248,urbanangler1990,2007-09-10 23:58:00,933,i cant decide from letter alone
112262,Bear,2007-09-11 00:44:00,106,"I hope its true, but he's a politician    . I guess we'll just wait and see.  When they come knocking this month maybe we should question them where they stand on the mnr issue  Bear"
112270,Cookslav,2007-09-11 00:54:00,1457,He's got my attention....
112272,Toronto_Angler,2007-09-11 00:57:00,698,I think if we create awareness that he has pledged this it would force him to be accountable for his promise. Hopefully we can spread it around so it doen't get buried as a footnote on the OFAH website.
112278,Rizzo,2007-09-11 01:15:00,4754,"sadly they are all a bunch of liars, and no, I do not feel I am overgeneralizing...its pretty much a proven fact.  Nonetheless I will give them my vote (lesser of the 2 evils in my opinion)"
112296,Roy,2007-09-11 01:58:00,13728,A pledge is only as good as the person's word making the pledge. I know it might be hitting close to home for a few people but that's the way it is.
112298,Pigeontroller,2007-09-11 02:08:00,2793,"You can bet Dalton's NOT going to do it, I say give Tory the chance..."
112300,Rombo,2007-09-11 02:13:00,39,i do a a lot of plumbing for politician's tory being one of them and i must say he seems to be the most honest one to date lets hope so.
112302,danc,2007-09-11 02:13:00,4677,"If Tory was smart, he'd pledge 100 million. Then give nothing. That's how Dalton got elected."
112303,Canuck2fan,2007-09-11 02:15:00,1444,This is the type of announcement I have been waiting to hear from any party to decide which party to vote for. I hope for his sake he isn't lying about this particular issue.... 25 million being restored in funding is a merely a start though. When you consider that Great Lakes supports a fishery worth 4.5 billion or so a year in both the U.S. and Canada it does seem kind of cheap.
112317,John Bacon,2007-09-11 02:45:00,3277,I honestly do believe that John Tory is different than the other politicians.  He's got my vote.
112342,Sounder82,2007-09-11 03:33:00,4,overall i think this is good for the fish and wildlife cause in ontario...but it begs the question...  ...how much of this is earmarked for Darryl Cronzy (aka Choronzey)??? or will that be a different announcement.
112346,aniceguy,2007-09-11 03:44:00,1094,"When the conservatives asked both John and I to write up a brief on what can be fixed within the OMNR we did, a full brief on all aspects.  I have met john many times and have conversed with him over conservation issues many more times.  Much of the tory platform came from our briefings to him and were reflected by other groups.  John is the real deal there is no doubt on that....  If you want conservation issues and more importantly the OMNR to regain its capacity to render services its intended for then vote for your local conservative canidate if not vote for good ole mc Squinty"
112349,scuro,2007-09-11 03:54:00,386,"It's 35 million earmarked for fish and wildlife (read hunting) programs. Granted any extra money, or fraction of extra money, would be nice, there are much bigger fish to fry in this next election."
112436,hawkeye,2007-09-11 12:31:00,162,"Like others have said, the lesser of evils. McSquinty lied his donkey off and now he wants another term. No thanks Dalton time to go home.  Maybe Tory will make a difference, maybe not, but IMHO he deserves a shot"
112447,Guest mistyriver1,2007-09-11 12:50:00,0,Any body else besides me think that Mcguinty looks like Norman Bates.
112451,Deano,2007-09-11 12:59:00,767,"He might as well promise the moon, it's been working for the liberals for as long as I can remember, and the people will once again believe them."
112513,Tacklebuster,2007-09-11 15:25:00,303," thats worth a chuckle, ""honestly and politicians"" in the same sentence."
112519,LeXXington,2007-09-11 15:36:00,1928,"I take the man at his word. Unfortunatly, we can only hope they tell us the truth and vote them out if not."
112521,Bear,2007-09-11 15:39:00,106,"PLEASE !!!!!!!!! KEEP HIM, we dont want him back in the part of the province  Bear"
112536,glen,2007-09-11 16:21:00,2641,I will give a Zillion of my own money if you elect me.
112540,TJQ,2007-09-11 16:29:00,7806,Thats not half enough for me.....
112542,wuchikubo,2007-09-11 16:37:00,1114,"It may sway my vote but the fact that the PC gov't cut alot of the funding to begin with when I was in University (more than a decade ago) still bites, it changed my studies and all. I still remember when I was looking for volunteer work at the Wye whats his name when they took 2/3rds funding away basically shutting down the places I could look for.  The McGuity Gov't has followed all other with their broken promises and makes it hard to believe them too.  I guess I'll still have to mull over it all as it comes closer.  Seems more like who hasn't ticked me off more vote."
112547,ccmtcanada,2007-09-11 16:45:00,7971,"I dont usually reply in political threads, but I thought I'd chime in on this one.....  In the Mike Harris days, he stated in his platform that he would cut cut cut.  Not only cut income tax, but cut all sorts of progams (education etc....).  Well, the Conservatives were voted in....even more impressive is that he actually DID what he said he would do.  Was he popular for it?  It depends on your point of view.  The funding to education hit a sore spot with many...but he did promise he was going to do it.  Did he cut income taxes?  Yep he did.  I didn't believe a word that McGuinty said, but I at least thought wouldn't raise or add any new taxes....jeez...he even put it in writing stating his promise.  When the health tax came into play, it just ticked me off.  I'll never vote Liberal again until they can prove to me that their word is worth anything....because right now, I cant believe a word they say.  So, back to the topic of this thread...if John Tory pledges 35 million, then I figure that's more than the Liberals have 'promised'....no vote swaying needed here....I never intended to vote Liberal anyways."
