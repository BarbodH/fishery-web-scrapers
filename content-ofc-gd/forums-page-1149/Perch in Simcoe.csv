113230,huntervasili,2007-09-13 02:21:00,1604,"When I was there a couple weeks ago we got on a few schools of em with fish reaching about 12"" and 1Lb... does that count for picking up? (we were fishing 14-16 FOW)"
113324,Sinker,2007-09-13 12:12:00,8692,It should be getting better by the week now. I want to get out this weekend for a  shot at them. This is the last weekend until hunting season starts........then my rods gather dust for a while.  By thanksgiving its usually on fire.  Sinker
113327,Terry,2007-09-13 12:20:00,14456,about 2 weeks should do it
113331,HUKDONFAWNIX,2007-09-13 12:34:00,135,Any general areas that are good to fish from a boat?  What about at the end of Tiffin St. from the docks?  When does that area start to turn on?  My little girl has started to really enjoy our shore lunches and I'm feeling a little pressure to deliver maybe one or two more before it's time to start thinking about Bambi and her friends.  lol.  I was disapointed that I missed last year's Perch run.  I wanna be in the thick of the action this year!  Thank you to everyone in advance for your help!

Will be heading out looking for the Birds(Terns) diving on the water after the bait phish, find them, and you'll find the Perch feeding. If you see my green Tracker stop and say Howdy"
