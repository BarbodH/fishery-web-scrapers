112843,balsamj,2007-09-12 02:42:00,4,Here is a picture of a mauskie I caught a few weeks ago...hope you enjoy.  Caught on ulta light tackle with perch pattern shad rap.  The real reson for this post is to get some help in finding a spot to fish salmon from shore.  I live in the beaches and want  to know if there is anywhere close by.  Much appreciated. balsamj

112970,Rizzo,2007-09-12 13:51:00,4754,"can't help you on the salmon but nice looking musky!  Looks like something took a chunk out of its tail at some point in its past.  One helpful recommendation though:  Take the hooks out before posing for the photo - if that fish thrashes around you've got trebles coming at you with a lot of speed, and if the unhooking job takes longer than expected, you can always opt to not take a photo to get the fish back in the water as soon as possible.  Either way, nice fish and good luck with the salmon"
113120,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-09-12 20:48:00,0,Nice musky! I agree. You should take the hooks out of the fish before holding it up! I have been stung by hooks and its not a good feeling....
113167,balsamj,2007-09-12 23:32:00,4,"Johnny Bass & Rizzo, Fish was landed boatside and tried to take the hooks out with no plyers.  proved too dificult so cut the line at swivel and held her for a quick poto and put her back in the water...took off with a splash and was doing just fine.  As far as I know its better to let her go with a little shad rap that will rust off in 3 days than to screw around with the hooks for 20 minutes.  I think I did the right thing...and i've got plenty of shad raps!  Thanks for the pointers though."

113244,vance,2007-09-13 03:11:00,719,Fished for 30 years and never needed pliers and then I caught a muskie-now I have pliers-- nice fish   vance
