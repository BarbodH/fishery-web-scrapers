This post is just a short photo summary of a few brookies from this spring and summer posted in 'my albums'. It was probably my most enjoyable year ever. While I haven't totalled things up, I tagged and released a bunch of brookies and tried to photograph them from a few different angles upon their release. I like Dan's idea to start a ""photograph forum"" to share ideas and techniques. Alan   "

In fact I know that he never wet a line. I wanted to go with him but I've got too much on my plate at work right now. There's always next year.."

I'd hoped to be up there this week but that too fell apart. Oh well guess I'll have to try for two trips next year. super pictures, congrats on a great year."
