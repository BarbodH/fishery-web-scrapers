505212,bassman,2010-09-20 12:41:00,384,"  Gord, yes we did. We tried three areas that have produced for us many times, but the musky had lockjaw.  The only highlight was pulling into the marina and seeing a young lad with a walleye. The smile on his face was priceless.  Oh well, sometimes the fish have to win too.  Cheers!"
