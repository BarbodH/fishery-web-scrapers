505222,Guest nuker,2010-09-20 13:40:00,0,"i have a bow mount transducer for my sonar that is strapped to the bottom of my trolling motor.  i can't figure out a good way to run the wiring without it being annoyingly in the way, hit by the prop, or getting pinched when over steering, etc...  pics would help, thanks!"

505275,Terry,2010-09-20 17:37:00,14456,some of the power head trolling motors you can't put it on the shaft except at the very bottom because shaft slides all the way through the power head each time you stow it
