No excuse but thats it Richard"

504807,spinnerbaitking,2010-09-18 00:25:00,1622,"Years ago we looked into fishing the inland lakes & extended season areas, for Bass, Pike & Musky afterTrout was closed Sept 30 & were told that we could do both, I'm sure it's been over 20 years, mostly fishing the lakes but definitely fishing the rivers a bit also, not real keen on being in a Canoe once the water gets to cold, but have used a small aluminum boat when available Richard"
