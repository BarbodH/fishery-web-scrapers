Problem is - the bench seats are all the way to the floor so I can't run pvc/abs along underneath the floor to run the wiring.  I want to find some sort of flexible conduit that I could run along the gunwale or the bench seats up to the front of the boat.  Would anyone know of something that would work? If there is such thing as 1 1/4'' big-O or something like that it could work.  Cheers,  Scugog"
505019,ch312,2010-09-19 15:03:00,1590,"they sell gray flexible conduit for electrical purposes. i forget what its called, but any supply store should be able to hook you up.  but, does it really need to be actual electrical conduit? for a boat i'd just use some type of hose to contain all the wires as it will likely be cheaper and do the same thing...  http://www.directindustry.com/prod/norres-schlauchtechnik-gmbh-co-kg/flexible-plastic-cable-protection-conduit-with-connecting-element-26237-377032.html"
505025,scugpg,2010-09-19 15:37:00,1373," Nope it doesn't have to be electrical conduit, just some decent hose would work. Do you have any suggestions? Would be nice to get something cost-effective.  PVC is like $6.00 for a 10ft piece too bad this won't work very well in this case."
505027,tb4me,2010-09-19 15:54:00,3295,I used a garden hose for my boat.It tucked right up under the gunwale nicely! Just a thought
505037,Matt15,2010-09-19 17:11:00,107,  You could use liquid tight. Its a flexible conduit. It comes in two sizes 1/2 and 3/4 and can be found an home depot.
505040,scugpg,2010-09-19 17:36:00,1373, That might be a bit small for 4ga wire though. I'll need at least a 1'' or 1 1/4'' diameter

505092,cram,2010-09-19 22:35:00,1733,Go to a pool supply store (Pioneer is often cheapest) and pick up 1or 1.5 inch flexible hose....its what they use for aboveground pools. Flexible but has some structure/rigidity.
505095,scugpg,2010-09-19 22:58:00,1373,I suppose I could use Black Flex-Loom...it won't get hooked up easily but won't keep much water out. Might be an option.  I'll check around town and see what some hose shops have for this application.
505134,alexmedic,2010-09-20 01:57:00,186,"Princess Auto.  Loom for a great price..  Every 8 inches or so, add a zip tie to keep it all together.."
505145,steelee,2010-09-20 02:22:00,13,"the electrical conduit mentioned above is called coreline, probably your best bet"
505177,cram,2010-09-20 09:47:00,1733,"btw - i don't mean the hard plastic hose. There is a rubberish hose material used for plumbing pools. Flexible, waterproof, and has a coil built in to the rubber for rigidity. Probably a dollar per foot."
