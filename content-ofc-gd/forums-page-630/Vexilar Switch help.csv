504942,Cudz,2010-09-18 23:23:00,2652,"The main power on/off rocker switch on my vexilar is pooched.  I need a new one but have looked all over in stores such as the source, princess auto, ideal supply, hobby shops etc for one but without luck. It is very small 6a 125vac the number on the side is j-606 6a 125vac. it looks like this and it is very small.  If anyone knows where I can get one (the closer to Barrie the better) could you please enlighten me. I need it by the weekend. thanks "
504943,ld17,2010-09-18 23:31:00,319,did you check the vexilar site for parts?  You would think they should have the part.
504945,Cudz,2010-09-18 23:50:00,2652,yes I did and I could not find it.
504993,Sandbag,2010-09-19 11:44:00,533,Cudz....that switch looks remarkable like the switch I recently replaced on my central vac power head/hose unit.  I had no problem locating one in Hamilton at any vacuum repair place.  I believe it was about ten bucks.  May be worth looking at  Cheers  Craig
