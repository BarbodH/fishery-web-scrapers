504981,ehg,2010-09-19 04:04:00,2666,"Was able to get out for my fourth day of fishing this summer Noticed the water was quite murky from algae bloom and the leaves were starting to turn a little. Showing fall is around the corner. Fishing was a little tough with the regular bass and panfish patterns not working at all, not even a rock bass.  So just trolled around for muskies. My buddy Dave put on a 12"" jointed perch Leo lure and nailed this decent fish.   Fish was 36 inches and getting chunky for the fall. Seems like the open deeper water muskies are more silvery and not barred much.  Trolled towards more shallow water out of the wind using musky spinnerbaits. Ended up catching this little one.   It was 32"" and more barred caught in much shallower water.  Caught some fish so it was a pretty good day"
504990,lew,2010-09-19 09:14:00,12766,Good stuff Eric.
504991,brickNblock,2010-09-19 10:21:00,598,"Nice catch, even nicer considering the amount of time you only managed this season Eric..SO FAR...! That 36"" looks much larger, healthy looking fish."
504999,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-19 12:31:00,0,"Great report.Two nice musky, no skunk and spent on the water with a good friend.Sounds like a good day to me too."
505023,Pigeontroller,2010-09-19 15:31:00,2793,"Yup, that first fish looks bigger than 36"" to me.  Good job Erik!"
505026,Joey,2010-09-19 15:54:00,9122,Good stuff Erik.  Glad you got into a couple.  The first one is very nice.  Joey
505067,ehg,2010-09-19 20:15:00,2666, Definitely not a spectacular day but any day fishing is better than none  Maybe that fish was a bit bigger didn't measure to accurately in the cradle. Caught it by the dropping springs coming out of fairly deep water;  read 22 ft when hooked. Thanks for replies!
505086,highdrifter,2010-09-19 22:01:00,2534,Nice tint to those fish budday!  They must be blending in with that bloom.  Now that is evolution!!  cheers HD
505122,Familyfisherman,2010-09-20 00:57:00,188,"We fished a tourney last weekend on Pigeon -- it was a multi-species tournament and muskies were not included...we had 3 on but with 6lb test we didn't land any, but the 2 we had a good view of were high teens/early twenties fish...Muskies are great fun, but on 6lb test the end result is retying your jigs..."
505139,limeyangler,2010-09-20 02:19:00,5204,"Great job Eric,  I think the 1st one looks bigger than 36"" too."
505311,ehg,2010-09-20 19:11:00,2666," Use to jig for walleyes often up there and had muskies hit the jigs. Sometimes they were to big to get in on 6lb test, the biggest muskies i saw were caught fishing for walleyes.  Thanks Simon, your posting of trips keeps me sharing as well"
505415,Leecher,2010-09-21 00:29:00,7832,Glad to see you got out and get into some beauties Erik Great job you two Thanks for sharing Leechman
505529,majorlifts,2010-09-21 17:29:00,171,"Ya, I think next time its Muskie trollin for me. Just bring the heavy gear and kill it. I think we can do much better as the months roll into November. Thanks EHG for the good day hitting muskies. I guess that punch in the stomach was really never meant to be. LOL!!"
