Just curious what kind of structure I can expect ? what the best types of baits would be for that lake ?  Thanks !

It is a very big lake, a lot of creek arm coves and deep, the shoreline can just drop away in areas. It is a TVA lake, Tennessee Valley Authority, a power and flood control lake, a dammed and flooded valley. Largemouth, Smallmouth, and spotted bass I think, also 1+ crappie are fairly common."

Bass are bass, some times the approach to fishing for them is different, google floatnfly, shakey head worm, a couple of popular methods in that area. You do have to find fish to catch them though?"
