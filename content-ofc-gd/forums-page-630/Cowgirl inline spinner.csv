505312,linweir,2010-09-20 19:12:00,202,Anyone used this muskie lure? I try to order a couple. Wonder if it's worth $30 each (much more expenisve than most bucktail spinners)? They look mint though.

505317,Garry2Rs,2010-09-20 19:21:00,1425,Buy a low gear reel if you are going to cast them...HAHAHA.
505329,Guest gbfisher,2010-09-20 19:48:00,0,I'd make my own blade bait rather than pay 30/bait. You could make 5 baits for that price. Lots of info online to do it yourself.
505371,Andy,2010-09-20 22:42:00,330,"  I haven't made the jump to anything that big blade wise, although the St. Clair Hounds I talked about in an earlier post come close bladewise. Cowgirls create a lot of drag, and a lot of reels (and fisherman) can't handle cranking them for any length of time. Last time out I spoke to a couple good fellows from the States and they always troll with one. A very popular lure that some would put ahead of sliced bread, as far as being the greatest thing. I have a number of the smaller Double Showgirls and DC-8 Llungen Tale bucktails that look cool, but haven't caught me any fish yet. This is quite possibly due to me having more confidence in other lures and switching up pretty quick. I'd sell ya 3 of my double 8 baits for that money if you lived close to Stratford and wanted to try something similar but in a little smaller size. But I digress. A lot of people love 'em. Do a search on a couple U.S. musky forums for more opinions on these baits. Andy"

In my humble opinion the D13 is probably a better trolling lure than casting lure, but I really like throwing the D10's and D8's."
505488,lew,2010-09-21 13:20:00,12766,I use the double Cowgirl style baits with blades up to #13 and use a 7000 series Abu which makes them pretty easy to crank. I'm not a fan of Abu's but the 7000 works well for this application.
505514,linweir,2010-09-21 15:41:00,202,"Thank you guys for these info. I made some similar (?) cowgirls type lures. I purchased skirts from Ebay, and put thme together with blades. Looks cool, and yes, it's cheap. May it work? I don't know, I haven't landed one using it, LOL. However I still wanna try real cowgirls. I'm told they're really productive."
