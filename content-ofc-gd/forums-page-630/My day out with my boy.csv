This post was inspired by the adventures of Ryan, Averie and Luc LOL"

505556,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-09-21 21:00:00,1107,Thanks merc. The bird was small about the size of a bluejay mabye a bit bigger.
505559,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-21 21:21:00,2690,"Great little post, and still a good story for Kaleb when he gets older. He may just have the ""fishing gods"" on his side hooking a trout right off the bat at the age of 2"
505569,danbouck,2010-09-21 21:41:00,4380,"Awesome, we should get him and Jacob out in the boat for some perch"
505571,Eazy,2010-09-21 21:44:00,260,Startin' him out early eh?
505580,Pigeontroller,2010-09-21 22:17:00,2793,Great pic of your Son!
505581,mercman,2010-09-21 22:24:00,7054," on second look, the tail markings look a bit like a peregrine falcon. they are a smaller bird about the size of a pigeon maybe slightly bigger. I cant think of another smaller preditory bird. looks bigger in the picture against the bg"
505660,Dave Bailey,2010-09-22 02:59:00,1641,"That is one cute kid, great pic!  And I'm thinking that the bird is a sharp-shinned hawk, if it was small then it would have been a male. The tail is too squared off for a peregrine. They also have longer legs and that one appears to be sitting higher on that perch than a falcon would:  "
505677,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-09-22 05:00:00,1107," Thanks he is a clown always messin around ,your the second to mention the SS hawk only thing I could find that looked simalar was a merlin or a harrier regardless it was cool to see they went right into the water just scrappin till the kingfisher got loose and took off .  Dan B for sure we should take them out perchin but Kalebs only good for a short trip."
