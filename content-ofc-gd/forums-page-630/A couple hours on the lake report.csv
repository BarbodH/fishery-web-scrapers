504862,limeyangler,2010-09-18 13:24:00,5204,"Hi all,  Got out with a couple of guys i know. Both fish tournaments(walleye) regularly as a team so was nice to be asked to come along in their boat. We have all fished this lake before although not together, so finding fish was not an issue, holding on them when we did find them was tricky though back trolling with a 9hp with 40-50kmh gusts, but hey...fall fishing is where its at for walleye and those conditions are the norm....suck it up...lol.  This Lake seems to be go deep or go home except for mid summer, i fished it on the ice last winter and fishing 50'+ was the key most days. We got our limit although time was an issue as we spent the first hour and a half trying to row back to shore in high winds with one paddle after the motor cut out, we ended up dismantling the gas tank to find the fuel hose had detached from the valve on the tank and was sitting at the bottom of the tank.  Jigs and large minnows and suckers was the bait, fish holding to drop offs from 20 to 40' and on the flats in 40' to 48'. Not my best video ever, but in a small 12' boat with three biggish guys in high winds made filming difficult, but the action was fast and furious, rob and I tied for first place with fish both at 23"". We did end up keeping our 1 over slot per person simply because we were running out of time to keep all under slot which is something i normally do, and turns out the boys practice to .   Here's some vid and pics of our little expedition which i will be repeating on Monday hopefully.
