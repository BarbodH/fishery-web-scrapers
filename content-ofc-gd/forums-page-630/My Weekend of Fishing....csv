505156,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-20 02:42:00,2050,"Saturday I volunteered my time to help untangle lines and bait hooks at the Facts of Fishing for Kids Day at Ontario Place.  So I decided it'd be a good idea to wake up at 3 a.m. and hit the mouth of the credit for a couple of hours first.  There was the usual packed house on the pier and in the 3 hours I spent out there nadda... not even any fish surfacing... But I got an arm workout and the sun rise was bad-ass.  Twilight...   Sunrise...   and wider shot...   After that I drove down to Ontario Place and had a great time with the kids!   One little guy caught an insanely huge crayfish... the picture doesn't do it justice!   Then today I decided it was about time to take the boy out and show him where Averie and I disappear to each weekend!    First time on the big lake with two kids meant Grandma had to tag along in case he lost it on the water! haha He turned out to be a champ and loved every bit of it...  The first step...   He had no problems going 25 MPH on the lake!   Averie let him use her rod at first because we haven't managed to buy Luke his own just yet... she used my ultralight for a while...   The kid got into her usual sunfish right off the bat...     But she didn't like using the big rod so we let her have her ice fishing rod back and luke and I used the ultra light...   Trying to figure out how to use the turny thing... haha   First fish (wish some serious help from dad)   We drifted along and caught all kinds of little dink perch but the kids had lots of fun...   Dad feelin' tall for once...   Pointing out seaguls...   Averie decided it'd be fun to show Luke how the boat Rocks back and forth! haha   Grandma even got in on the action...   Then we stopped by the ""lookout"" on our way home to say bye to The Bay for another weekend...   Hard to beat a country sunset after a couple hours on the water.   Sorry bout all the pix... I was just stoked about getting my boy out on the lake for the first time... And Grandma is trigger happy with the camera..  Enjoy your work weeks!  Cheers, Ryan"

Dano - he didn't get out in the boat as early as his big sister because I didn't know if I could handle both of them at once...  turns out it won't be a problem...  as for fishing next weekend feel free to fire me a PM... Friday I have a wedding out of  town so Saturday's a no go - and sunday I might be stuck catching up on some house work, but i'll see what I can do!  I'm outta here have a good week!  Cheers, Ryan"
