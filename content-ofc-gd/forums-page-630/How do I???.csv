505195,archer379,2010-09-20 12:05:00,277,Is it all the way down and won't go up
505210,Tom McCutcheon,2010-09-20 12:35:00,627,I am interested in this answer also. One of the posts on my boat seems a little sluggish and does not rise to full hight. I have tried adjusting the green screw on the top of the post but it doesn't help. SWIVEL EZE is the manufacturer.  Tom.

505217,Harrison,2010-09-20 13:14:00,2202,"I had to replace mine.  They pop up on Kijiji here and there, have an eye."

505294,Uncle Buck,2010-09-20 18:25:00,1000,"surprise, marina wants you to buy a new one..."
505297,HTHM,2010-09-20 18:27:00,4082,"No, it is all the way up and won't go down, I may have to see my doctor..... Given my height that could be a good thing though."
