505445,LeXXington,2010-09-21 02:10:00,1928,"That sucks, camera's or a pait ball gun"

505057,Gerritt,2010-09-19 19:33:00,6129,"Well it looks like my quiet little neighborhood is going to crap!  Neighbors car got stolen a month and a half ago... it was found.. trashed  2 weeks later some punks walked up the street slashing tire sidewalls of every car that was parked on the street, including my girlfriends work vehicle..  And now, my girlfriends car was stolen on thursday night.. found yesterday @ 8pm... we brought it home last night.... it was a disaster.. dirty underwear hanging off the rear view mirror, it was CAKED in mud... ignition was laying on the floor... 420.00 to the tow operator...  They stole it again last night!!!!! Jesus!  OPP called us @ 430am asking where our car was... we said we just got it back, it was in the driveway... the lady on the phone asked us to take another look.. sure enough the car was gone..  this time the punks trashed it into a ditch on the 403 @ Wilson st...  I live on a pretty quiet street.. and this has me fuming mad! I am about ready to turn off all the lights and wait with my 30-06 and wait for the buggers..  so now I am looking at another 500.00 charge to the tow company!... so almost 1000.00 down the drain because of a bunch of idiots.  /End Rant  G"
505058,Bernie,2010-09-19 19:44:00,3190,That sucks G. I'd love to catch them  They must know you are asleep at 8 PM too.
505059,Joey,2010-09-19 19:45:00,9122,"Geez Gerritt, that totally sucks.  You should install some cameras and catch the dirty brats in the act.  Now I'm just as mad as you are     I hate crap like that.  Joey"
505061,misfish,2010-09-19 19:57:00,29133,"When will it go back to the day,  when you caught them,gave them some good ole smacks and kicks to the ars, and gave them to the parents so they could smack them again  Got some crap going on here to aswell G.  Once again,the young offenders act makes them UNTOUCHABLE."
505062,Terry,2010-09-19 19:58:00,14456,I feel your pain  and that's why I have 8 video cameras around my property  and an UZI under my bed  ok no UZI but I am looking for one..LOL
505064,bassman87,2010-09-19 20:04:00,586,where do you live? brooklyn ny?
505066,GBW,2010-09-19 20:10:00,8460,"Sorry to hear G, I would look into the camera thing for sure!"
505069,Woodsman,2010-09-19 20:28:00,1286, Terry what the heck is an oozie? Is that when you stub your toe and it bleeds a little?  Sure you didn't mean UZI.
505071,Terry,2010-09-19 20:38:00,14456,well you can tell I really don't own one LOL...
505072,tb4me,2010-09-19 20:59:00,3295,"Considering where you live this doesnt suprise me.I have family there.They have just the same problems. Geez I could only imagine, Man I wouldnt want to live there.Id be in prison by now."
505076,mercman,2010-09-19 21:10:00,7054,"2 pool balls, an old hockey sock, and 15 minutes behind a closed door.I bet they would remember that the next time the urge to be jerks overtook them"
505101,ChrisK,2010-09-19 23:39:00,2772,Sorry to here that Gerritt. Hope they catch them. In our neighborhood everybody owns dogs and they all loose it when someone walks down the street day or night so its pretty safe.
505116,purekgw,2010-09-20 00:30:00,585,hey gerrit you still in Caledonia?!?
505120,outllaw,2010-09-20 00:55:00,1232,totally sucks. i would spend the next 500.00 on moving.
505154,Cast-Away,2010-09-20 02:35:00,790,Gerritt spend $100 on CAA+ and you will have no more towing bills!
505206,jbailey,2010-09-20 12:31:00,866,"ahh most of my family lives in Caledonia and they've had their cars stolen multiple times. More recently my cousin had his engine, gas tank and seats stolen out of his boat."
505211,Headhunter,2010-09-20 12:37:00,5703,I hear yah G! I pity the poor dude who tries again and you get ahold of 'em... HH
505233,torco,2010-09-20 14:52:00,656,Wow that sucks. I'd be moving or building some sort of fortress around my yard?
505237,ColdH20guy,2010-09-20 15:12:00,312,"[  Once again,the young offenders act makes them UNTOUCHABLE.   ?? how so?"
505247,Governator,2010-09-20 15:53:00,879,"At the very least, I'd put ""The Club"" on.  While it's not exactly professional car thief deterrent I think it would prevent most if not all amateurs.  Professionals take your car to sell it, amateurs take them for joy rides & pranks.  I would also at at least install motion sensor lights where the car is parked, unless it's on the street.  That way you would probably notice when they attempt it."
505252,Spiel,2010-09-20 16:17:00,9065,Brutal! Should I go shopping for a couple of baseball bats and a box of beer Gerritt........
505254,vinnimon,2010-09-20 16:25:00,2593,That really sucks Gerrit!Happened to me as well except for the second attempt I poopy(yes poopy trap ) trapped it! But my other car at the same time had the window smashed! They must of known I owned both!
505285,cityfisher,2010-09-20 18:09:00,959,thats brutal !! i guess no point going through insurance? deductable too high
505292,solopaddler,2010-09-20 18:24:00,8605," Caledonia, stolen car capital of Canada.    That's the sad truth.  My dad's truck was stolen in a Costco parking lot a few years back and ended up in....Caledonia.  A good friend also had his truck stolen from a Costco parking lot and it also ended up in.....Caledonia.  It seems to be a common theme.   In any case I'm sorry to hear of your troubles Gerritt."
505296,Uncle Buck,2010-09-20 18:27:00,1000,"have you thought about getting one of those battery disconnects, kills the power, install a key, it closes the circuit giving the vehicle power again?  also a friend of the family use to pull the fuse for the fuelpump cause he didn't drive the car often, it stopped it from getting stollen..."
