505338,super dave,2010-09-20 20:07:00,323,"Question for you Sportspal owners.  I just picked up a used one for pretty cheap but it needs some work done to it.  One of it being replacing the foam liner.  I know I can get a replacement one from the North Bay but by looking at it, it looks like a plain piece of closed cell foam.  Any of you owners replaced it by purchasing the foam somewhere else? Also a few of my steel ribs are missing.  I guess Iâ€™ll buy those directly from the company unless anyone else has any other suggestions.  Thanks in advance."
505345,HTHM,2010-09-20 20:25:00,4082,"They just re-did Solopaddlers Sportspal, it did not cost very much, and the boat is in great shape now. Might be worth going to the factory to get her re-done. He was VERY happy with what they did."
505346,solopaddler,2010-09-20 20:28:00,8605,"Yep, they did a great job and it was very reasonable.  I'd bring it to North Bay and have them refurbish it."
505366,jediangler,2010-09-20 22:16:00,1923,I drilled holes in all the aluminum ribs and made them permanent using stainless steel nuts and bolts. I replaced the foam sponsons on mine but never needed to replace the floor in 15yrs. I ordered the sponsons and installed them myself. I think the order came in to New Hamburg from North Bay in two weeks.
505367,splashhopper,2010-09-20 22:17:00,2931,is anybody heading up to North bay this fall?  I may send mine up as soon as bass season ends.
505434,Nipfisher,2010-09-21 01:26:00,2449,"Splashopper,  Come up in the winter for some Lake Nip. ice fishing. There are a few of us on here that are talking about a gtg in this area."
505623,splashhopper,2010-09-22 01:20:00,2931, I just may do that.... i got in to ice fishing last yr for the first time... would be nice to catch something bigger than perch through the ice too
505631,Muskieman,2010-09-22 02:10:00,2472,Great Idea!!!  Just talkin about that in Chat... OFC ... Nipissing Hardwater Reunion.  Randy 
505634,solopaddler,2010-09-22 02:14:00,8605, It's a great idea. If there are any walleye left to catch.
505644,Nipfisher,2010-09-22 02:28:00,2449,We can all hang out in Randy's Mallard. There are still lots of walleye to be caught. I'm interested in helping to organize it. Maybe a little friendly derby???
