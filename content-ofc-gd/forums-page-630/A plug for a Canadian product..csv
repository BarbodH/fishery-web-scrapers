505286,Andy,2010-09-20 18:10:00,330,"I just received a St. Clair Hound musky bucktail in the mail. It's a Canadian made product from the south shores of Lake St. Clair. Now I might be a little premature in my praise of the product, but I must say I'm impressed without having even used it. The price was reasonable, and it was in my mailbox within days. It it a beautiful bucktail. I have had good success with Mepps bucktails in the past and they remain a favorite lure.  I also have some double showgirls by Musky Mayhem. I have yet to get a fish on the Showgirls, and I must admit, part of the problem could be that I don't give them enough time in the water. But if the Hound works as good as it looks, I may sell the Showgirls to make room for more Hounds. I have a number of Double Showgirls, and I have yet to net a fish with any of them. So what I guess I'm saying is that if you believe buying Canadian helps us all, take a look at these lures. I am not affiliated with the company. I talked to the owner on the phone, and his service and attitude were great. I know Johnny Dadson makes a good lure as well, but I haven't purchased one of his lures, yet. Just something to think about if you're looking to add to your arsenal. (and who isn't) Andy  http://web.mac.com/dogriver1/Dog_River_Lodge_Lure_Company/Welcome.html"

But I do believe there are muskies over 70 lbs somewhere in Ontario.....I'm guessing GB and lurking the depths. And if we continue to have these mild winters the possibility of one being caught will increase."

505463,Dave Bailey,2010-09-21 04:29:00,1641,They're on my list at this post. Check it out for lots of Canadian manufacturers. I didn't know we had so many!
