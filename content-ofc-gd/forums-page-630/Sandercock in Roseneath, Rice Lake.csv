Ridge view cottages is offering accommodations at 25.00 per person per night. They would prefer a 2 night minimum though.  Here is their website and email address:  http://www.ridgeviewcottages.ca/ [emailÂ protected]"

I suggest sending him a PM or contacting him on the Rice Lake Fishing Board.  It might also be on the Rice Lake Tourist board under a new name.  I don't know where the old resort was located, so cannot help you there.  Good luck."
