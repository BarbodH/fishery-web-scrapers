505041,Gregoire,2010-09-19 17:48:00,1397,I went to a local antique market today. I picked up a few fishing lures. I was just looking for some input.  Here is a photo of the noteworthy lures I acquired:    There is a jointed believer in there (that is the reason I bought the lures). It is in a colour pattern that I don't think they make anymore. There is 2 Baglye's big b's I think that I got from another vendor. there is a bagley's crawfish. There are 2 big o's i believe. Also there are three in the package canadian northern spoons. I also got an older tackle box. I think I did well. Here are some other pics.  
505044,bow slayer,2010-09-19 18:01:00,1074,don't know what you paid for the northern lures in the package but they are selling them here in London at Liquidation World for 50 cents each.
505047,Gregoire,2010-09-19 18:31:00,1397,The northern lures came as a lot with the believer and the big o's . I didn't pay too much for them.
505049,MSBruno,2010-09-19 18:38:00,369,great pattern on the believer!
505084,dave524,2010-09-19 21:53:00,4508,"Looks like a Delfin Alligator in the bottom right of the first pic   Those things are legendary on spring spec lake trips, for me anyway. I could go spring spec fishing with those and EGB's and never want another spoon. Nice haul."
505089,Gregoire,2010-09-19 22:11:00,1397," That's what it says on the spoon, I've never heard of it, but I will keep it in mind. I've been dreaming of taking a spring trip to Algonquin. There's a purple lure with pink spots and a neon green belly. Does anyone know what that is?"
505096,Rizzo,2010-09-19 23:08:00,4754, Not sure what it is but I had one of those before. Pretty sure its something you'd pick up at a Giant Tiger or Dollar Store (I keep cheap stuff available for people renting my cottage). The one I had at the cottage caught me a few fish before someone lost it. Actually swam pretty good for a cheap bait. I remember fishing with a couple of my nephews and nobody would use that bait because it had pink polka dots...I put it on and nailed a 20 inch smallie within minutes!
505097,Crazy Ivan,2010-09-19 23:08:00,184,Hey Fishgreg - that is a luhr jensen power minnow.
505099,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-19 23:28:00,2690,"Sorry, should edit this...the purple/pink lure isn't the Alligator...it is the red/silver spoon. That is most definitely a Delfin Alligator.  Nice pick-up...do you want to sell it?  I picked one up myself years ago at a Flea market...still have it and a couple old ones...one of THE ALL TIME BEST Lake Huron steelhead spoons for whipping off the piers.  Kicks a Little Cleos butt most days."
505100,Gregoire,2010-09-19 23:37:00,1397,The bagley's lures I got are db-3's apparently they are not made anymore and are in high demand. Does anyone have any info on these?
505307,Garry2Rs,2010-09-20 19:00:00,1425,"If it's that brown one in the top left, they're the ones I used to use.  they're a balsa wood, teardrop shaped diver, much like the Rapala DT-10.  The finish used to crack after awhile, but they were a very good bass bait.  You can twitch them on the surface near cover, then crank down. Garry2R's"
505370,Gregoire,2010-09-20 22:34:00,1397, Thanks for the tip. I am not a huge bass fisher but I'll keep that in mind.
