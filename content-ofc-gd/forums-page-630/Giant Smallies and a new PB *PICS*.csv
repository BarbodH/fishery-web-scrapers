505304,steverowbotham,2010-09-20 18:46:00,1800,"It's that time of year!  I always look forward to fishing after Labour Day, its my favourite time of year!  I've been out quite a bit lately, and on Friday I took out a couple friends for the evening.  Launched at Smiths Bay and east to fish some islands and shoals.  The fish were very aggressive and we were able to land almost 20 fish in the 3-4.5 pound range including one about 5.5 caught by a good friend.  Fish were all caught on a variety of baits including jerkbaits, crankbaits, tubes and dropshotting slammers.  Very fun evening and nice to spend some fishing time with good friends, and no money on the line haha.   Noel's new PB @ 5lbs 8oz   Sunday I fished a tournament on Lake Couchiching.  I was on very big fish the weekend before but was unable to land many of the fish I hooked, a string of bad luck and stupid mistakes had cost me big.  So this weekend I needed revenge.  I went to my zone and caught a 3lbs largemouth on my 2nd cast.  Looking good.  An hour later and no more fish in the boat, I hit a stretch of docks.  I finished the stretch of docks without a sniff.  Uh oh.  Headed to some deep rock/weed transitions... got a 13 inch smallmouth ... eww. Went to some shallow reeds and started flipping matted grass/reeds.  I had a big bite under one of the mats and after I stuck her, I just couldnt haul her out and by the time I got in there, she was gone.  Finally made the choice to go fish for smallmouth and it was the right choice.  We landed about 12 good smallies and the choice was good enough to put us in 2nd place.  Was hoping for #1 for the 3rd year in a row, and #2 is becoming far too familiar, but I'll take it!  Kelli finished her old job on Friday and starts her new job on Wednesday, so with the incredible weather today, we decided to fish this morning.  On the water at about 8am.  We were visiting her parents in Innisfil so we launched there and fished my childhood stomping grounds.  I have to say, I'll be spending a lot more time visiting that area.  When I told my dad where we were going, he drove down to meet us.  With the flat calm weather, the shallow fish were pretty spooky for the most part, and didnt get bit for the hour before my dad arrived, but we finally found the right colour slammer and they would inhale it.  Still tricky to get bites, but we were able to get some and they were good ones! The highlight of the day and possibly the season was sliding the net under Kelli's PB smallmouth.  This thing was a moose!  She weighed in at 6lbs 13oz and was one of the fattest fish I have ever seen.  She spotted it cruising in about 14 feet of water and and threw her dropshot about 20 feet past it and the fish circled it 3 times before deciding to eat it.  Such an awesome fish!  There is just so much good water to fish on this lake, it never fails to amaze me!    "
505319,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-20 19:23:00,2690,"Congrats to Kelli!!!!  I definitely have to give those Simcoe smallies a shot.  Nicely done, Steve."

505326,Rod Caster,2010-09-20 19:39:00,5784,"Those look like tiger bass. What beauties and congrats to you two on catching and netting that monster. I'm so jealous, Simcoe spits at boat-less fishermen....except for perchin'."
505327,ehg,2010-09-20 19:44:00,2666,"Good going Steve! That is an incedible smallie for Kelli  Nearly 7lbs, congrats."
505330,steverowbotham,2010-09-20 19:48:00,1800,Her previous PB was 5lbs 4oz and for 3 years now she's wanted to break 6lbs.  She kinda shattered that lol

505361,steverowbotham,2010-09-20 21:55:00,1800, Probably the smoothest reel I've ever owned!
505362,steverowbotham,2010-09-20 21:56:00,1800," You're right.  I was surprised at how calm she stayed after its first jump.  She told me after its first jump, this is the biggest I've ever caught."
505364,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-20 22:00:00,0, What reel is it?

505515,fishindude,2010-09-21 15:43:00,220,"Way to go Steve, that fish is an absolute hawg. Congrats to your fiancee for catching it! You seem to have these Simcoe waters on lock, any chance the waters around Innisfil happen to be safe for a canoe under calm conditions? Not looking to venture too far from shore..  Thanks again for sharing your reports. Always a pleasure to read!"
505519,lew,2010-09-21 16:22:00,12766,"Steve, you must have an awful lot of happy friends and customers with all the huge bass your always putting them on.  Congrats to your GF, that smallie is a real beaut !!"
505589,Jigger,2010-09-21 23:03:00,1237,"You must really love her Steve. Alot of guys might've accidentally ""bumped"" into their wives/gf/fiance, and grabbed that rod while she was swimming... But you didn't. Good onya! Congrats on the new PB to the lucky lady!"
