745937,Reelaction,2012-11-23 14:19:00,33,"Hello Everyone.  I have been lurking on this board for quite some time now and have finally decided it was time to come out of the woodwork and begin contributing to this informative and interesting site.  I currently live in Kitcher and have been in this area for most of my life. My two favaourite fishing partners are my overly adventurous wife and my 13 year old son. Who I think will be a better fisherman some day than I am.  My current fishing includes great lakes trolling (Mostly Lake Erie) and jigging walleye, perch and bass out of my Lund tiller and 80 hp Yami. In the last couple of years, I have also enjoyed Kayak fishing with my wife in smaller lakes or rivers. Except for the one trip she talked me into paddling 5 miles offshore of longpoint. Good thing we hammered the perch.  I aslo enjoy fall fishing for Stealies and ice fishing. It's great that this sport has something to offer in every season.  I look forward to sharing our adventures with all of you   See you on the water Chris"
