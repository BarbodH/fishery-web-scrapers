745256,northernpike56,2012-11-20 01:41:00,717,"I broke off one tonight that had to be close to 6 or 8 pounds due to improper equipment (6'6M rod).What are my options for a 'proper' rod? Ideally, I want something 8'6-10'6 that can handle anything from a steelhead to a salmon, and is able to drift roe in the creeks as well as cast spoons from the pier. It has to be a 2 piece rod as well.If this 'ideal' rod does not actually exist, what would by my two best options for steelhead fishing/drifting roe, and salmon fishing/casting spoons?Thanks,Matt."
745258,trevy727,2012-11-20 01:53:00,351,"10'6"" MED light St Croix Avid. Sensitive tip and plenty of backbone."
745264,kemper,2012-11-20 02:07:00,2232,"That's a lot to ask from a single rod.  ""Float"" rods are designed to allow for light leads, and pier chuckers aren't for the most part.  I'm not saying that the two are mutually exclusive, but if its at all in the budget you might consider two rods instead of one.  I have a stable of sticks, and probably could set you up with an entry level float rod for very cheap. PM me if you are interested."
745271,chefboi17,2012-11-20 02:45:00,128,"I have a 9'6"" shimano clarus that sounds like what you want. Mine is a med 8-12lb. Its not quite as light action as you would want for small stream fishing with lighter leads, but it definately has the backbone to handle a lake run chinny from the pier."
745296,northernpike56,2012-11-20 03:54:00,717,"what about a 10'6 ML Fenwick elite tech? decent all-around rod?  or I could maybe get a 9'6-10'6 L Fenwick HMX for my steelhead, and a 9'6 M Fenwick Eagle for casting hardware to brown trout and salmon?"
745304,Twocoda,2012-11-20 05:59:00,4130,Raven RV or IM 9 ..youll turn a salmon around and finesse a bow to the bank....Now heres the GREAT part....CANADIAN COMPANY and no Bullpaddys when it comes to warranty...they cover mis-fortunate circumstances...
745321,BillM,2012-11-20 13:29:00,17367, I don't think he'll be chucking hardware with either of those
745324,GBW,2012-11-20 13:37:00,8460,"Anyone have any feedback on the ""Streamside Float Steelhead Fishing Rods""?  Not meaning to hijack the thread, just wondering..."
745325,Live2fish85,2012-11-20 13:40:00,1633,Streamside float rods are actually an awesome rod for the money. There warranty is good to. I was told about them by one of the best steelhead fisherman out there. Since then I got one and we also just started to carry them in our shop. They didn't last long.
745329,GBW,2012-11-20 13:50:00,8460,if I recall Canadian_Copper has some too.  I need to go get one in my hands then.  Tks.
745331,BillM,2012-11-20 14:25:00,17367,"Streamsides are hard to beat, great bang for the buck."
745364,northernpike56,2012-11-20 16:41:00,717,do they make spinning gear too?
745467,GBW,2012-11-21 03:43:00,8460,Streamside?  Yes they do.  Sinclair has one that I think he likes last I recall.  If he doesn't like it I get 1st dibbs!
746200,northernpike56,2012-11-24 05:10:00,717,"So... I went to SAIL today for the black friday sale, and bought a 10'6 medium power, moderate action, fenwick HMX. Thoughts on this rod? Good choice for drifting roe and casting lighter hardware? I think I'll buy a MH fast action rod this spring for casting heavier spoons for brown trout, such as a fenwick eagle or something, unless this rod I got already has the capabilities for casting heavier spoons for chinooks?"
746205,Twocoda,2012-11-24 06:20:00,4130,ive got the HMX 10 6 and the first one blew up on me in a matter of a few outings of being brand new...had an over the counter replacement and havent been able to hurt the rod in almost 9 years (i think)... i only use it for chucking hardware chinnies and bows...even the clackin raps @ 15 bucks a pop...so dont be scared to chuck heavier hardware...i run straight 10# test on mine for lures...the rod will tell you when you have to move your feet to chase down a fish...i worry about line....not the rod when fighting a heavy salmon....
746212,Canuck2fan,2012-11-24 11:53:00,1444,"Unfortunately finding one rod that is GREAT at all aspects of steelheading is all but impossible, since Shakespeare stopped making the Catera line of rods. The 11.5 ft model is perfect for drilling even the heaviest of spoons all night long. Then in the morning you can rig it for bottom bouncing or still fishing. As a float rod in moderate sized streams it is excellent.  The reason it can do all these things is a design feature I haven't seen on any other rod. All but the last 4 eyes on the rod are single foot which gives it incredible sensitivity, while the other eyes are double foot which give the rod incredible back bone and power to turn large fish. For incredible toughness and strength it is IM-8 but it weighs almost 3.5 ozs more than my 11.5 IM-8 Swan noodle rod (which is only good for float fishing). Another huge plus for the Catera is the short butt which doesn't get caught on clothing like many steelhead rods with long butts do. All for a rod that cost 69.95 I wish I had of bought more of them LOL.  Quantam makes a great 10.5 ft rod for float fishing small streams with a Michigan handle 55.00 at Angler Outfitters, and for chucking spoons and bottom bouncing/still fishing if you can find a shimano 10.5 ft convergence for around 65.00 with a michigan handle you should be able to cover just about any situation you mentioned.  If you are however hooked on Steelheading you better save some room in your storage area as your collection of rods will surely grow... I never go out without my Catera and one of my Swan rods along but I also have 5 no 6 other rods that I switch things up with from time to time LOL."
746477,Rich,2012-11-25 12:18:00,3927,"Use a noodle for floating, use a long spinning rod for chucking lures. 8' MH action rods will chuck a spoon a mile and wont break the bank."
