746223,fish_fishburn,2012-11-24 14:08:00,1311,Nice fish. speaking of Walleye has anyone been on the Ottawa River of late. I have been out twice this week and have been putting a beaten on them. Probably 20 fish in 6 hrs of fishing and the largest was 25 inch and the smallest about 18 inch. There deep 30 to 35 ft. Trolling TD-11 and reefers. Gold and black combo seems to be the hot colour. Sorry for h-jacking your thread.
