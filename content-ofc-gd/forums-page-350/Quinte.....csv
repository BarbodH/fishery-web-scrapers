742042,Gerritt,2012-11-04 18:18:00,6129,After a preliminary search.... I came up empty handed...  Are their Ice Bungalows for rent on BOQ? like their are on Nipissing?  I would really like to let the girlfriend experience ice fishing...  Any thoughts on an outfitter to use?  Thanks in advance!  G
742043,Spiel,2012-11-04 18:21:00,9065,Not sure about Quinte Gerritt but I believe there's a few options on Simcoe now that is still relatively close to home and of course it does offer a more varied species list.
742045,kickingfrog,2012-11-04 18:24:00,8333,I would think the much more unpredictable nature of the ice on Quinte would make them uncommon.
742046,Gerritt,2012-11-04 18:25:00,6129,Thanks Spiel I will look into it
742047,Gerritt,2012-11-04 18:26:00,6129,  You may be correct.... did not think of that... I figured someone out there had a business running servicing this niche.... in a bay or what have you...  but I do think you may be correct.  G
742050,bobowski,2012-11-04 18:58:00,360,There are no ice bungalows that i know of on quinte but there are a few hut operators.
742054,Gerritt,2012-11-04 19:27:00,6129,  Any you can suggest?
742058,irishfield,2012-11-04 20:10:00,26272,  Send Lloyd (Fishhunter) a PM Gerritt... he'll hook you up with I believe it's Dave. One of the charter guys does ice huts in the winter as well.
742060,Gerritt,2012-11-04 20:13:00,6129,Thanks Wayne!
742061,irishfield,2012-11-04 20:15:00,26272,Not sure how fast you'll hear back from him... he's out on the water doing a charter today... but then again it's tooooo dammmmn early to be thinking about ice fishing anyhow!!

742124,dhickey,2012-11-05 01:29:00,1038,Your more than welcome to join me on my winter trips up in my neck of the woods. Its not on the bay but you will enjoy the fishing on some of the back country lakes? If your set on fishing the bay I do know of a tournament fisherman that also guids year round on the bay. He might be a good starting point. Pm me or send me a text..  Don.
742130,Fish Farmer,2012-11-05 01:46:00,2234,"I've heard that those ice bungalows can be a bad thing Gerrit, confined for 2to3 days in a shack can be a little house bound. Mite turn your friend off of ice fishing. Maybe do day trips and stay in town so you enjoy a little night life thing and stretch the legs if you know what I'm saying. Just a suggestion."
742207,Harrison,2012-11-05 16:12:00,2202,"A good guide service on Quinte is usually on the move following the big fish and is as knowledgable on the safe ice as one can be.  This is why you hardly ever see a TV show host out there alone!  If you combine the above and the upredictable ice thi is why you do not see bungalows on Quinte.  The guys I used to refer all my clients to stopped guiding on the ice, but there are a few good ones in that listing provided above."
746257,Marko,2012-11-24 16:57:00,854,"Hey guys, I am going to bump this because couple of my friends and I are looking for a similar thing. We would like to stay there for couple days and find a place to sleep for couple of nights. Doesnt have to be fancy....just a roof over a head and some heat."
746262,Stoty,2012-11-24 17:31:00,2910,"No ice bungalow's on Quinte... but get in touch with Jeff C of the ""Quinte Ice Fishing Team"" if you're looking for a good guide service for the hardwater!"
746263,Stoty,2012-11-24 17:32:00,2910, Twin Peaks in Napanee is where I normally stay.
746749,fishhunter,2012-11-26 12:53:00,604,"Here you go, two choices  http://www.fishfindercharters.com/  or http://www.pbandjcharters.com/icefishing.html  Both stand up guys and would have no problem sending my solf water clients to."
746751,Roy,2012-11-26 13:14:00,13728,Thanks Lloyd.
747084,Marko,2012-11-27 13:41:00,854, Thank you Lloyd! I saved Dave`s phone number. Ice cant come fast enough now!! Funny thing is that i used to hate it...winter and ice.
