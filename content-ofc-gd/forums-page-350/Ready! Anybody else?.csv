746438,dhickey,2012-11-25 03:16:00,1038, i would realy be intrested in learning how that technique works?  Crowding isnt a problem for me..
746439,BillM,2012-11-25 03:18:00,17367, Guys were getting greased out on what little ice there was last year on Simcoe..  Complete madness.
746441,MJL,2012-11-25 03:32:00,2427," Indeed.  You know it’s bad when you can see the other angler’s lure on your sonar  If this year is the same as last, I may invest in a bunch of wacky waving inflatable arm flailing tube men to surround myself with and make the appearance that I’ve already been greased out"
746442,dhickey,2012-11-25 03:36:00,1038,  Like i said most of us southern Ontario boys have been ready to go since last March... That ice flow rescue thing last year was a good one :rofl2:dunno:

746510,BillM,2012-11-25 15:10:00,17367," Thanks Skip, appreciate the info."
746515,Rod Caster,2012-11-25 15:21:00,5784, The full arm jig is what I use for walleye on Nip as well. It's a great feeling when you go to sweep upwards and the rod loads right up!
746516,Rod Caster,2012-11-25 15:23:00,5784, to the shelter that doesn't fit in car. I'm looking at my packed up Eskimo in the sleigh and wondering where the hell I'm gonna put it inside the condo in the winter.
746518,GBW,2012-11-25 15:24:00,8460,Bath tub...
746521,Rod Caster,2012-11-25 15:29:00,5784, hahaha I've been known to use the tub as my melt station before. Sooooo....your probably not far off.
746523,limeyangler,2012-11-25 15:29:00,5204,Awesome post!  Those boots look really good.  We got snow last night....same night the lake locked up  Oh well.....looking forward to your reports Chad.
746526,Rod Caster,2012-11-25 15:34:00,5784," It might be a slushy start for you then.  NBay: -10 last night with fair winds and no snow, -8 right now with no snow  Boots are Cabelas Saskatchewan Pac Boots....they are actually on sale right now. I've had them for over 4 years and would recommend them for any outdoor activity where you stand in one location for any period of time. Walking....not as good."
746538,limeyangler,2012-11-25 16:08:00,5204,  Wow...youguys are getting more winter than us. Yup...slushy start for sure...only hope is that not much snow interest long term forecast here...but we all know how reliable the longterm forecast is  We might check some smaller walleye or brookie lakes next weekend.....where and what you starting with?  As for boots.....I have a 3 year old pair of Sorels...never had cold feet...like yours awkward to walk in...but standing by your line for a few hours andthey are wicked warm.  There is a silver lining in getting some snow here.....I get my new snowmachines on Thursday....Test ride Friday on the lawn!

746543,Rod Caster,2012-11-25 16:16:00,5784,That's right...the new sled. Not sure I'd be thinking about fishing with that beast on the way  It's either a very small walleye lake or a small splake lake for my starter. Already got plans in motion with JoeyTier.
746573,Lip-ripper,2012-11-25 19:24:00,228," Sounds good to me, I'm gonna try to get out alot more this winter"

746613,esoxansteel,2012-11-25 22:07:00,1307,"  Ive got 2 of them and if someone offered me 500.00 for 1, id say you just bought yourself a manual hand auger"

746706,adolson,2012-11-26 03:09:00,783,"I am working on making a second rig so that I will have two rods and two stationary rigs - enough for two people, so I can go with a friend or family member who doesn't have their own gear but would like to fish with me. The second stationary rig will come in handy on the colder days when I get too lazy to jig.  My rig is not really a traditional tip-up. Or maybe it is - I don't know much about ice fishing gear, really. But I love it. It's a hockey stick, a tip end from a 2-piece fishing rod, and an HT electronic spool/reel that beeps and flashes an LED when line is taken out, so you know if you get a bite without having to keep your eye on it every second. It worked very well for brookies last season.  My gear is pretty much ready. I'm not sure how much I'll be out this year though. I thought I would be out all the time, but now, I still care about fishing, but I don't want to miss anything with my son. I will definitely hit the ice a few times. Gotta get me some trout.  Hmm, if I bundle him up warm and take him, can I put four lines in?"

I'm very jealous of your 2 man hut    If you ever feel the need to drive up north into la belle province... be sure to give me a hauler... would be glad to show you some of my spots up here Jacques
746359,misfish,2012-11-24 23:37:00,29133," You have not fished with Terry. Thats a 1 MAN HUT.  Skip,Wally world has them. Dirt cheap.IMO"
746360,Rod Caster,2012-11-24 23:37:00,5784," Agreed! If you need any parts, I've got the contact information to the manufacturer in Toronto. They can supply any part for very cheap....like 50% below retail.   As far as the living room, I suggest checking with the wife and asking her first if her friends are coming over...it can (has) create a bit of a situation  Hut dimensions are: Height=68 inches Width=58 inches  It looks perfect for two people, tackle and a couple pops.  The auger is also extendible...I've only bottomed it out once and that was in far north Alberta. It's extremely light and easy cutting. Just like WD said, i've yet to find anything better for lightweight, cutting and portability."
746361,Rod Caster,2012-11-24 23:40:00,5784, D'oh!  actually that was the picture taken last year before I even had them on the ice once. I face them down now that I know....these things work like a charm and I can't wait for a big laker to start peeling line off as I run like a madman and trip all over my own feet and spill my beer and throw my gloves 30 feet in some random direction.

746366,Leecher,2012-11-24 23:53:00,7832, I figured it was the case   the cat was kind of familiar to me  Good luck with your upcoming opener... if you can't be good... be careful

It involves jumping as high as you can while you make a big upward sweep of the rod (the longer the better). I don't think I actually caught a fish with that technique, but it quickly scared off all the people that tried to park themselves right next to me"
