A road about 180 km east of Montreal was recently widened so drivers didn't have to manoeuvre around a bend that was deemed dangerous. However, the transport department and the hydro utility didn't communicate to have two hydro poles removed.  The regional director for the transport department admitted there was a miscommunication with Hydro-Quebec.  ""It's unacceptable,"" said Gilles Bourque. ""As the one responsible for the regional transport network, we should have ensured that this didn't happen.""  Gilles Therrien, owner of the company that executed the work, said he was embarrassed about the poles, but there was nothing he could do - he was just following orders, he said.  ""Everyone knows it looks crazy,"" he told QMI Agency. ""But the transport department is our client. You must understand, I was somewhat uncomfortable to criticize them.""  It will cost up to $10,000 to remove the poles and repair the road again.  The poles were reportedly removed late Tuesday."

746188,Fisherman,2012-11-24 03:31:00,7201,"Oh don't get me going on them,  back in the '70s listening to the morning news, it was common for the announcer to say, Highway 170 kills another(between Jonquiere and Chicoutimi), if they all weren't trying to be a bunch of Villeneuves, they might live longer.  Never figured out how a road could kill someone, but you try and get them to believe it."
