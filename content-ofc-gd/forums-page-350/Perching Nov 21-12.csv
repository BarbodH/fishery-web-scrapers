746258,Jen,2012-11-24 16:58:00,833,"I needed to be on the water on the 20th, but the day just didn't come together for me.  So we launched the boat on the 21st out of Sugarloaf Marina in the fog.  A short run and we dropped anchor!                The day was for my brother!  Fishing was who he was, who we were together!  Competitors, fishermen, warm or cold, good or bad weather, finding the SPOT or not, we always tried and today we did that... finding where the other boats were in the fog a few miles from the boat launch was a bonus, staying when most of them left a chance, limiting out a bonus!  What a great day with some great people!"
746260,i2cool2fool,2012-11-24 17:03:00,349,Nice haul! They'd make a tasty fish fry.

746273,Jen,2012-11-24 19:13:00,833,Thanks Roy but that wasn't me... That was my little sister and a friend of ours! Dad would have killed me had I not dressed her up in a float suit! lmao
746275,Roy,2012-11-24 19:26:00,13728,"Wow, you certainly are lookalikes. And yes, at this time of the year, float suits are indispensable."
746283,Leecher,2012-11-24 20:17:00,7832,That's awesome   I know exactly how you feel about getting out fishing and dedicate the day to loved ones    had a similar day as yours last January 7th... my dad would of been 80 years old and limited out on speckle trout  I'm sure your brother would of been proud of you   Kudos Bernadette Thanks for sharing!

746546,Jen,2012-11-25 16:46:00,833,"8.8 lbs once all cleaned and bagged...not bad for a couple of hours.  Minnows were from Erie Tracker... tiny little guys but they worked wonders  And yep, float suit for perch.  She was warm and I didn't have to hear it from my dad about taking his baby girl fishing in NOVEMBER!  You have no idea how that would go! lmao! Better to be safe than sorry!"
