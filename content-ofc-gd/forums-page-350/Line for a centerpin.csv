746771,Reelaction,2012-11-26 16:13:00,33,"Here's another vote for Maxima Ultra green. Great knot strength, shot holds well and doesn't damage line. No problem running a 6.8lb raven lead.  Have used this line for many years. Experimented with others but always went back to it on my float reel."
746833,Hairpy,2012-11-26 19:56:00,73,"8 or 10 lb Ande for a very long time , tried other mainlines but nothing works as good for my bad casting abilities  Joseph"
746847,Spiel,2012-11-26 20:11:00,9065,Maxima Ultra Green all the way!
746402,GBW,2012-11-25 01:49:00,8460,Hey all.  So I decided to give a centerpin rig another go.  I never used a 'hi-vis' line before as a main line but it seams everyone out there but me is now using a bringt colour line.  Is there one better for sun up or sun down applications then a standard mono?  Does it make a diff at all during the day?  With all the 'stealth' approach to fishing why a hi-vis line?  Yeah I know you still use a leader of some sort; just wondering why the bright line.  Is it to see the bight before you feel it?  What is a good line to use?  And NO I don't want the best I want the best bang for the buck plz.  Cheers.  Geoff
746403,BillM,2012-11-25 01:53:00,17367,"High vis line usually feels like rope, I hate the stuff.   12lb Raven is cheap and good, 10lb XT will also work just fine.   I run braid on both my setups until it gets below freezing, after that it's 8lb Drennan Super Specialist Mono."
746405,GBW,2012-11-25 01:57:00,8460,If that's the case then why bother use it?  Right now I have #14 suffex mono on and it's ok.
746407,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-25 01:59:00,10439, High viz sucks!!!! You end up having to run a shotline between your main line and leader. More places for things to go wrong.  I run 12# Raven green main line.
746408,BillM,2012-11-25 01:59:00,17367," I dunno, some guys like seeing their line, lol.  14 seems like a bit much, but if it works for ya, then stick with it.  I've heard the Raven is good stuff, nice and supple when it's cold, not much memory.."
746414,GBW,2012-11-25 02:04:00,8460,  Thank you both.  Case closed.  I'll go back to the Maxima green in #10 or 12 if not the Raven line soon.  Cheers.  Next topic!
746424,Canuck2fan,2012-11-25 02:19:00,1444,"No wonder I never catch any fish my line must be too light.... I use 8lb Raven Hi-vis green mainline now on all my reels including spinning love being able to see the line do things before the rod tip moves while perch fishing and bottom fishing for steelhead. I also use 4lb or 6lb Varnish for leaders for chrome... Or is it Vanish? Not supposed to work for leaders in any event, but then I seem to be catching more fish than my friends who use really really expensive line and leader material."
746425,BillM,2012-11-25 02:21:00,17367," It's Vanish   I use it for leads when fishing crappie, but they don't do much to bust me off.  8lb main line is fine, as long as you've matched your leader to it you're good to go..  You also might wanna check out Maxima Ultra green mono, a bit tougher then the Vanish and works just as good as flouro in my opinion."
746426,MJL,2012-11-25 02:22:00,2427,"I run 10 & 12lb Raven on my reels (Pretty much depends what the local tackle shops have in stock). I don’t run hi-vis at all (that’s just my preference). For Raven I run lines in either the blue/grey colour or green colour (also depends what the tackle shop has in stock at the time).  I’ve seen guys running hi-vis lines without a clear shot line and catching fish. Personally the only time I can think of it being useful is when fishing amongst a crowd of people – ie. Casting over each other’s lines. In my case, the rivers I fish the vast majority of the time are crowd free and worrying about other people seeing my line is not a problem.  Back in the day before Raven, I used to run Maxima UG in 8lb. I found that it handled pretty similar to 12lb Raven. Maxima in the higher lb test (12 & up) is pretty thick (IMO it's under rated as far as breaking strain goes) and if you're using smaller shots, you may need to use a thinner diameter shot line below."
746427,DMASSE,2012-11-25 02:23:00,420,I use a high viz line on all my setups.  I like being able to tell where my line is at all times...  The line I personally use is ANDE Green 8-10lbs  dave
746430,kemper,2012-11-25 02:36:00,2232,"Nanofil.  You can see it (if that's your thing, I don't think its useful), you can MEND it (this is very useful), it casts a mile, it floats, it doesn't stretch... should I go on?  Only downside is running a shotline. Not required but I find it to be helpful."
746432,BillM,2012-11-25 02:51:00,17367," You don't wanna fish this line in below zero temps, ice in the guides will rip it to shreds!  I also find after a while the first few feet will sink, I usually just cut it off and I'm back to mending like a champion!"
746449,kemper,2012-11-25 04:14:00,2232," Haven't had that problem Bill, what # are you running?"
746452,solopaddler,2012-11-25 04:38:00,8605," Agreed. The fact I have to run a shot line is a negative, but the advantages of this line outweigh that aspect.     Also true. It gets shredded once the temps get below zero. I'll be switching over to mono this week."
746469,Rich,2012-11-25 11:49:00,3927,I use 8lb berkley big game on my aventa.. works much better than the 10lb raven hi-vis that was on there previously. With a 6lb berkley professional grade flouro lead.
746472,davey buoy,2012-11-25 12:05:00,5505,"You always hear stealth,stealth when talking steel head. Than you see a guy this past week with high vis line and only 18"" fluro leader get two fish. Makes you wonder if the fish can really see much at all?. Lol. Maybe water clarity also plays into it?"
746473,Rich,2012-11-25 12:08:00,3927,"Theres a whole lotta myths to steelheading.. i went 3/7 on a trib on thursday, by #7 i realized i forgot to put a flouro lead on at all!"
746475,davey buoy,2012-11-25 12:10:00,5505," There you go,another good example.Thanks"
746494,dave524,2012-11-25 13:46:00,4508,"I use 10 Trilene XT on both my float reels, split one of those 330 yard reel fillers packs between them. 2 110 yd spools of Maxima ultra green in 4 and 6 lb test for leader material and I'm good till steelheading ends in May. 20 bucks covers line and leader for the season"
746507,Bondar,2012-11-25 15:03:00,817,"I use 10lb Berkley Big Game on my float reel and baitcaster and 8 on my spinning rods in the boat , I prefer the clear over the green . The clear seems better in the cold maybe it's just me lol"
746514,GBW,2012-11-25 15:20:00,8460,Thanks again folks.  I'm going to finish this season off with what I have on now as I use a #4 fly line as the leader and so far the drifts are fine.
746602,frozen-fire,2012-11-25 21:38:00,542,"Hey Geoff, I also use Raven 10lb mono as mainline. Hasn't given me any problems.  You need to convince Will to get back into river fishing!"
746621,GBW,2012-11-25 23:01:00,8460,It won't take much to do that.  I think he want's to get out next weekend.
746623,misfish,2012-11-25 23:05:00,29133,"Read this thread many times,want to post,but it would seem it all comes down to preference. I started out with braid as my main. Hated it.Tried the pline hydra float,no longer is it on my reel. Coating seperates. Went  to Maxima moss green, it,s a line I have used before on my spinning reel on the rivers. Now getting kinda experimental,I have Raven green 8pd HIGH VIS,SILK THROUGH THE EYS,as my main,very happy with it thus far all fall.My lead is Sufix floro. Very strong and has served me well.   Oh that PLINE HYDRA didnt go to waste. It,s my backing."
746625,GBW,2012-11-25 23:08:00,8460,good to know B; that the line didn't go to waste...  it sure would have here if I tried it and didn't like it....
