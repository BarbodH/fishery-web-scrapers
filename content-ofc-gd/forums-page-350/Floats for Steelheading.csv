746656,Twocoda,2012-11-26 00:34:00,4130,most fishermen buy those things and make up fish stories...
746695,skeeter,2012-11-26 02:15:00,1907,  That's only if Buffalo Bill flies in your supplies on time.  :tease:
746698,super dave,2012-11-26 02:23:00,323, Me too.  Mine aren't as pretty but they work fine.   Made a DIY lathe out of a dremel.
746700,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-26 02:23:00,10439,  You mean Buffalo Joe. I actually ran into Mikey at the NHL lockout tour charity game last week.
746478,Rich,2012-11-25 12:25:00,3927,"What kind do you use, when floating?  Up til this year i used blackbird phantom floats exclusively, until i picked up some larger sheffield slip floats this year. It took some adjusting, but i now love the flow-thru line style floats! So much more convenient.  What do you use?"
746481,Christopheraaron,2012-11-25 12:40:00,3525,"I use  phantoms, but I'm thinking of switching to slips because I fish a lot of deeper pools."
746483,ChrisK,2012-11-25 12:46:00,2772,Mostly Drennan loafers in the 2 to 3 gram. Suits my style of fishing.
746489,Twocoda,2012-11-25 13:06:00,4130,Mostly Drennen and Raven depending on water clarity...but since river traffic is getting out of control im contemplating using a beach ball as a float..so there is no excuse for others to cross my line..lol
746491,Fish Farmer,2012-11-25 13:22:00,2234, Now that made my morning. Now I have to clean my monitor
746499,bow slayer,2012-11-25 14:37:00,1074,"i like the cork ones ,can't remember the brand name,they are stamped with a logo with the letter S . The custom made ones they use to sell in Goderich Bait and Tackle (balsa) back 15-20 years ago worked well.I use to also use a Thill balsa that had a thin metal wire bottom,it was made for fast current,it let the bait get down stream ahead of the float with less drag on the wire bottom. I just can't seem to find them anymore,they worked very well."
746509,BillM,2012-11-25 15:09:00,17367,"Bowslayer, I think you are thinking of Streamside floats.  I run BC Supremes, Riverwoods and a few made by a buddy."
746525,MJL,2012-11-25 15:34:00,2427,I primarily use Riverwood floats...It's mostly what I can get for free by picking them off of trees and snags. Back in the day I used to run mostly Drennan Avons and Loafers but sold them all off for cheap because I just had a hard time seeing them.    Lebarons has a bunch of the Thill Turbomaster floats in stock in a few different sizes.
746539,kemper,2012-11-25 16:10:00,2232,"I turn my own slip floats, mostly from 6g to 15g."
746542,Garnet,2012-11-25 16:14:00,2056,Phantom has full line of slip floats clear plastic and balsam.
746549,Ainsley,2012-11-25 17:01:00,142, What material do you use? Balsa?
746576,bow slayer,2012-11-25 19:47:00,1074,"  yes streamside....funny thats what i was thinking,just wasn't sure"
746582,Spiel,2012-11-25 20:01:00,9065,  
746595,misfish,2012-11-25 21:16:00,29133,"  WOW those are so cool. I,ll bet their high end.How do you rig them?"
746596,Spiel,2012-11-25 21:18:00,9065, Red side up for visibility Brian.
746605,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-25 21:55:00,10439,Been making and using my own since the mid 80's.  
746606,misfish,2012-11-25 21:59:00,29133,Those are PURDY big guy.
746607,davey buoy,2012-11-25 21:59:00,5505,Real nice Dave!!!!!!!! Looks like different sizes/ weights.
746616,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-25 22:17:00,10439, 8-15 gm. I don't use baby floats any more.
746618,Twocoda,2012-11-25 22:31:00,4130, Am i the only one that wants to see a detailed thread of your production process from start to finish??? Nice work Dave
746619,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-25 22:38:00,10439, Gonna make a batch this winter. Maybe I'll doccument the process fer ya.
746620,misfish,2012-11-25 22:44:00,29133,"All kidding a side Dave. I was into making my own. I had a hand held drill, rig up on a jig. It was very rewarding to make.  My biggest problem back then (30 yrs), was finding the right seal for them. I tried the wood dope,but when left for a bit,they became sticky. I gave up.  I just seen your last post. Would love to see a step by step.  Nice work."
746629,BillM,2012-11-25 23:34:00,17367,"Mr.Orr, I'll happily purchase a dozen of those"
746644,Rich,2012-11-26 00:15:00,3927,Making your own floats is bad ass! I wanna try it!
746651,davey buoy,2012-11-26 00:23:00,5505, Talk about rewarding!!!!!!!!!that would be great to do!
