I am looking for a boot that I can put to the test. A couple of examples of their intended use would be fishing and hiking through the Niagara Gorge and upland bird hunting    Here's must must have list.  1) Must be waterproof. 2) Must be lightweight 3) Must be minimum 9"" high. Not looking for a low cut hiking style boot 4) Must offer good ankle support and an agressive tread. 5) Must be breathable, don't want my tootsies sweating, then freezing 6) Must offer enough warmth for standing around waiting for my float to go down.  Any suggestions are welcome.    Thanks for your help Chris"
746810,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-26 18:46:00,10439,I have a pair of Rocky's for hunting that are high tops with gortex and 1000gms of thinsulate that are good for that sort of thing.

""Nats"" are all rubber, lightweight & warm, with removable liners.  Also grip the ice & snow similar to winter tires.  I couldn't beleive how light they are when I first tried them.  Best rubber boot I ever used! Reasonably priced at $90.00."
