746762,NAW,2012-11-26 15:17:00,4022,"Had to use the golf as a show plow this morning.  Well. I guess it wasn't that bad.  About 10"" to 12"" in Orr lake.  There was even a small skim of ice Saturday morning in some of the bays.    The drive in was a little slow.  Thankfully, I put my winter tires on yesterday! "
746773,Rod Caster,2012-11-26 16:37:00,5784,"By all accounts, the small dose of snow in nbay is here stay. Good timing with the winters. Just got ours done on the wife's corolla... Three hours later i was driving on a flat tire. Ouch.you can bet I'm not paying them any extra work"
746777,Rich Clemens,2012-11-26 17:01:00,3131,"Pretty to see.  Probably not very long that we'll be seeing that stuff down our way.  Had a little dusting on the grass over Thanksgiving, but she didn't last long."
746805,GreenCanada,2012-11-26 18:31:00,375,"Wow, that's a really nice looking home N.A.W!"
746846,NAW,2012-11-26 20:10:00,4022, Thanks.  It's a   to heat!
746867,misfish,2012-11-26 21:00:00,29133, HA HA HA.   Now to follow some tracks bud.
746871,NAW,2012-11-26 21:02:00,4022,We set up 2 new stands on the weekend.  Hopefully they pan out for the late shotgun season next week!
747278,Joeytier,2012-11-27 22:31:00,3990,Yikes!  Glad we don't have that much powder up here.  No good for the ice!
747283,NAW,2012-11-27 22:41:00,4022,"I measured 13"" this morning...  Crazy.  That's over 30 cm of snow.  And it aint even December yet!  At this point, would the snow falling in the water help cool it down more?  Sure..Once the ice is there, snow is bad.  But to cool the water down before it freezes, is snow good?"
747286,aplumma,2012-11-27 22:46:00,6896,That is great man. I am so glad to see it snow up there. It means it hit the ground before it got down here.   Art
747288,NAW,2012-11-27 22:48:00,4022,"I'm not sure.  I don't see anything in the regs about it.  I thought I remember hearing something about restrictions on the lake.  To be honest, I've only lived in the area for a year.  And last winter the ice didn't form on the lake.  Every time I hit the spud, it went thru in one or two hits, all year..  The lake is full of natural springs, and has very inconsistent ice.  On that note...If you plan on going out, let me know"
747294,NAW,2012-11-27 22:59:00,4022,"I've only herd of one or two people that have ever caught a pike there in the past few years.  I also herd there are a few cottagers that have been importing fish in to the lake.  Crappies...  Not sure what that will do to the lake.  I have never heard of anyone catching a crappie in there before either.  And the bass.  Well, they are few and far between for the most part.  And they are fussy."
747322,Fisherman,2012-11-28 00:41:00,7201,"Bah, I think most of that will melt down on the weekend, supposed to hit +8 and a dump of rain."
747328,NAW,2012-11-28 00:53:00,4022, 100%.  It will be gone in no time.
747329,grimsbylander,2012-11-28 01:00:00,3016,I used to catch huge smallies on plastic worms and spinnerbaits around the pencil weed. Mind you that was 12 years ago.
