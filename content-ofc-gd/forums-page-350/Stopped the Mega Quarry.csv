745963,nancur373,2012-11-23 15:51:00,1211,"What is wrong with people these days. Don't you realize that rock had to be quarried to build your house? You can't stop development and advancement. Our country is growing and people need places to live. People don't mind quarries, power plants, industry, etc. as long as they're not in close proximity of them. Eventually money and power will win over protesters and forward movement will recommence. Did you know it takes approximately fifty trees to make the signs of the average protest?"
745985,Raf,2012-11-23 16:56:00,3495,"I think we all realize we need the dirt for infrastructure, housing, etc  however, I am not sure the highest point in southern ontario, where several headwaters start, on top of some of the best farming land in the region and then digging beneath the aquafir to boot is the best idea/place for it."
745999,Spiel,2012-11-23 18:08:00,9065, Bingo!

746002,BITEME,2012-11-23 18:24:00,1968,you are actually partly right the big issue was water purification
746476,Rich,2012-11-25 12:14:00,3927,Woulda made a big pond though.. lol
746535,Rattletrap2,2012-11-25 16:02:00,1652,"They have to start seriously looking at recycling the aggregate they have already extracted! Do you think dumping used concrete in  Lake Ontario to expand Toronto's waterfront is a good renewable practice? That land and the buildings on it are for profit only.  Like others have mentioned, the biggest problem with digging of this magnitude in this particular area, is the damage that could have been done to aquifers billions of years old that are vital to life as we know it."

745545,registerfly,2012-11-21 18:45:00,198,beat me to the punch.  do you have reason to doubt? hopefully this is true
745548,fishingwithbob,2012-11-21 18:51:00,123,"Nothing stopping them from re-applying for a smaller quarry to get their foot in the area without as much hassle (i.e. environmental assessments, etc.).    Wait to see if they put the land back up for sale or not.  That will be a key indicator of future plans, as I doubt they plan on getting into “potato farming“ like they said when they were purchasing the parcels.  "
745549,adempsey,2012-11-21 18:52:00,1498,"Somewhat shocked at this.  Although, I cannot say that I know the quarry would have had a negative affect on the environment, I am still happy that it's not going ahead."

745622,irishfield,2012-11-22 00:34:00,26272, Getting into? They ARE Ontario’s largest potato growing and packaging operation.!
745627,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-22 00:54:00,10439,Maybe they will just create 36 mini quarrys instead of one giant one.
745629,fishingwithbob,2012-11-22 00:59:00,123, Using the existing farms they purchased to be turned into the quarry.  Lets see how long they want to keep their money tied up with a green thumb.

745636,ketchenany,2012-11-22 01:25:00,3229,I have nice parcel in Aliston if they want to expand their potato operation. Just Potatoes.

745645,G.mech,2012-11-22 02:15:00,830,"Where does stone and gravel for our houses, roads, and buildings come from?  How far can it be trucked before the environmental impact from the diesel fuel and emissions from the trucks outweighs the inconvenience of having a quarry or a pit nearby?  At about 60 km, the cost of trucking equals the cost of the stone....how much are you willing to pay in cash and emissions to get this material that we all use???   None of us want this in our own backyards but in all reality, a pit or quary is one of the least intrusive forms of industry that we have....unfortunately, it's an evil necessity in this country."
745648,Roy,2012-11-22 02:22:00,13728, Well not for that little bit of knowledge. We've been posting about this in here since 2009 or earlier. I've been a little interested in it and have been keeping up on the situation.
745660,wallacio,2012-11-22 02:32:00,475," We definitely need aggregates for construction, infrastructure etc but the proposed quarry was not the way to do it espeically when the aquifer of key headwater rivers could have been severely impacted.  Thankfully responsible aggregate taking is gaining momentum so that this resource can be exploited without it coming at an unacceptable environmental cost.  http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/800009/momentum-continues-to-grow-for-socially-and-environmentally-responsible-aggregates-sera"

745704,pics,2012-11-22 05:39:00,1268,They bought the land from farmers who assumed they were only going to farm it. The quarry would have been very deep so the constant pumping would have lowered the water table enough to dry up wells and possibly ruined the headwaters of the credit......this is all old news....the US investors cared little about all the negative environmental stuff.....its all about profit$$$$$
745716,fishingwithbob,2012-11-22 13:02:00,123,"  yup, that would suck.  Maybe next year they should work a couple of extra months to be able to afford to get off the boat and onto land"

745730,BITEME,2012-11-22 13:48:00,1968,  i agree time to put the axe to them my buddy lives down the road in aberfoyle near a tap and his water levels(and others ) have been way off since they started to really pump he thinks even the chemistry of the water is changing    on a side note no rock house condo skyscraper bridge or any other aggregate based thing is worth the destruction of a billions of year old water filter
745895,TJQ,2012-11-23 03:20:00,7806,"Most people don't know this about me.. but I spent about 10 years as an environmental geology consultant that was pro quarry/industry. I managed projects and helped put in pits and quarrys up to 80 million tonnes. While weighing all the checks and balances.. everyone has to remember that these aggregate resources have to come form some where. Projects that large can do damage, but sometimes they are better than 10 smaller projects all doing damage. I think that what most people dont realize is that aggregates are like gold... decent rock/gravel just isnt everywhere. Not just any dirt can go into our nations highways, bridges and house foundations. LOL.. At least I never had to work on a new landfill.... whewwwww....  Not saying im pro quarry here.. but aggregates are like oil.. a finite resource...."

745925,Rod Caster,2012-11-23 12:11:00,5784,One of the biggest issues with this proposed quarry was the loss of food bearing land. They would be trading potatoes for backfill material. Near-city farms are very important!  It's like trading corn for car fuel
