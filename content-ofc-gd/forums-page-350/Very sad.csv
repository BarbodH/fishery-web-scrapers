746411,dhickey,2012-11-25 02:02:00,1038,The plain fact is that to many people dont understand common sence... For those that dont go on ice frequently then you shuold probably stay off it untill the locals say its good. Pushing your luck is best left to people that know whats going on. Ie/water temp/weather conditions/currents and probably most important sound...  This is truely a very sad event that could have been avioded.  Buy the way it is NEVER a good idea to skate on a freshly frozen pond or lake!!! as tempting as it is...  SD  WHY?
746416,Moosebunk,2012-11-25 02:06:00,3970,I feel for the boy and his living family... Grandpa at 64 should have known better I would think.  Tragic it is.
