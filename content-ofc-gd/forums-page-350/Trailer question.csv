Trailer is brand new...will it have plates already?....am I good to use it unregistered from manitoba to Ontario?  I am sure the dealer will know...but anybody here know the procedure....is there anything I need to sort out before I leave to purchase it and bring it home?  Thanks in advance.  Simon."
746998,Gerritt,2012-11-27 01:33:00,6129,Dealer should have everything sorted out for u.... Including registering the plate for the trailer.
747008,G.mech,2012-11-27 01:56:00,830,"  The dealer would likely provide Manitoba Plates.....in all honestly, i would either just take a plate with you to use until you get it home or get the dealer to fax you a copy of the documentation and take it to the MTO to get an Ontario plate before you go.  Once it's registered in Manitoba, it's going to be more difficult to transfer it here and cost you twice..."
747011,bigbuck,2012-11-27 02:06:00,2449,A Winnipeg dealer should be able to hook you up. They do a lot of biz w people from northwest ont.
747012,Gerritt,2012-11-27 02:06:00,6129,"I Should have mentioned it would be registered in manitoba with Manitoba plates...  Get the vin, model number and get the dealer to give u a bill of sale and register it here in Ontario before u go to Manitoba. Then u have your ontario plate."
747024,Bernie,2012-11-27 03:00:00,3190,We sell a lot of licensed vehicles out of province. We can get it registered in the province of choice. It may be worth the phone call to verify that has been done for you.
747064,limeyangler,2012-11-27 08:45:00,5204,Thanks guys....will call dealer in the morning...see if they will give temp plate....otherwise ask for VIN and bill of sale to register before i go and get my plate.
