746458,danc,2012-11-25 05:14:00,4677,"I've seen a few Moose in my travels in the past few weeks. I always enjoy seeing them. They tend to group up in the winter. The most I've ever seen (by far!) is between 15 and 20 in a herd on the highway to Red Lake about 8 years ago, in January. Once in a lifetime sight for sure.  Saw this guy near Red Lake a couple of years ago.  "

746692,Whopper,2012-11-26 02:10:00,2174,Dan more times than not I have seen plenty of moose traveling the 502 and the 105 and love seeing them. August on the 527  I probably saw one of the biggest bulls I've ever seen. I still am amazed at the site of them.
