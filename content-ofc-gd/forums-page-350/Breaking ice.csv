747031,Nipfisher,2012-11-27 03:37:00,2449,"I got a text this morning from Dan Columby asking me if I wanted to try for musky today on Nipissing? I am laid off now, so I figured why not. He said meet me at 11:30 and we will go open the launch. We drove from his house to the launch and when we parked I was suprised to see he had brought a spud bar, shovel, and several bags of sand/salt mix.  We broke the ice at shore and as far out as his spud bar on a rope would reach. It was close to 1"" in most places. Then I shoveled the launch and we spread 4 bags of sand/salt mix. We returned to his house to put on our floater suits and get the boat. When we returned to the launch the sand/salt had done the trick and it was bare to the pavement. Wish I had a photo of the launch before we did the work but here are the progress shots.        Here is a short video of the Cheif Commanda in it's winter home.   We foul hooked a cisco (lake herring) and hit 2 more (scales on hooks) but no musky on this trip. Water temps were 37-39 degrees. Air temp was -2 to -6 but sun was beautiful."

747043,danc,2012-11-27 04:29:00,4677, That would explain why you were skunked.  I know what you really meant. A hardcore effort for sure. Better luck next time Bud.
747055,Moosebunk,2012-11-27 06:10:00,3970,"Tough getting skis to chase with temps like that... even harder, doing figure 8's with your rod through the ice."
747059,cram,2012-11-27 06:40:00,1733,Good for you guys.  Sounds like a great trip even if the fish weren't cooperating.
747067,Nipfisher,2012-11-27 12:11:00,2449," Hey Dan, I edited the post thanks."
747068,Nipfisher,2012-11-27 12:15:00,2449,  We were all set up to fish the minor period which is only about an hour. Marked a ton of big fish hanging around under the bait and tried to run our lures within those bait schools. Either way a beautiful cold day on the lake with a good buddy.
747076,LucG,2012-11-27 13:14:00,779,You guys are nuts! But I am extemely jealous haha  Too bad your efforts were not rewarded with a musky. I stored my boat before I went deer hunting and I really regretted it when I got back. lol
747095,Rod Caster,2012-11-27 14:44:00,5784,Awesome! Me thinks he'll get another opportunity this year...back to warm temps next week  
747098,Nipfisher,2012-11-27 15:03:00,2449,  Nipissing closes to all species on Nov. 30th but Trout Lake is still fishable.
747350,Nipfisher,2012-11-28 02:02:00,2449,  Here is the accidental catch of the day.

747427,outllaw,2012-11-28 14:18:00,1232,sweet report. thats a dedicated musky hunt.
