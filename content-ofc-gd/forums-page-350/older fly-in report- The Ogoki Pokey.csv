741695,chris.brock,2012-11-02 17:11:00,4053,"it was mid August, the water was super low, no bugs was a bonus, stayed at John Rich's camp, flew with Nakina air, we did get 5 pike over 10 lbs but I don't know where those pictures are, this was my 2nd time to Ogoki, the last time I was there the water was super high, the fishing was quite different in the low water, in August  stayed at Twin Lakes the night before we flew in    lots of decent walleye    everybody having fun    speckled trout rapids below Kayedon    the owner John came in mid week, I got to fish with him for an afternoon, what a treat, he grew up on the lake, he showed us plenty of sunken islands and humps, after a couple drinks he started to chat more, great guy, great stories    John could clean a walleye in about 15 seconds    having a stretch break on a rocky island    time to fly out, this was the weather, we were stuck in camp for 36 hours, no beer or booze left, if you're going to be stranded, Ogoki Lake isn't a bad place to be, I was fine if we were stuck for even a couple more days, we fished but stayed fairly close to camp in case the Otter came in  "

741698,SirCranksalot,2012-11-02 17:17:00,3291,"Nice post, and pix---well, except for that election sign!"
741699,BillM,2012-11-02 17:19:00,17367,"I hope your burnt that election sign, lol!"
741700,chris.brock,2012-11-02 17:23:00,4053,"I think the Guergis sign was patching a hole in the cabin, so it stayed put, it would have went in the fire otherwise"
741702,BillM,2012-11-02 17:23:00,17367,At least you were making good use of the sign
741718,solopaddler,2012-11-02 19:03:00,8605,I noticed the sign right away. That's Eddie's (as in Eddienorth) cousin from the Barrie area.  Can't believe he dragged that up there LOL!  Always wanted to fish Ogoki. What was the outpost like? I'm guessing not overly luxurious.
741734,irishfield,2012-11-02 19:44:00,26272, Hope that's the only time he's nailed her to the wall !  Keep'm coming Chris... nothing like trips down memory lane!
741790,chris.brock,2012-11-02 22:59:00,4053,"John's outpost is top notch, new and clean, 3 bedroom, a bunkie also, 2 fridges work well, electric lights, hot water, shower  Wilderness North's camps look very well kept too, Leuenbergers Kayedon camp is great- idyllic spot, all log cabin with porch  I still prefer the older camps where you feel you don't have to take you boots off when you come inside, and you can feel the history of the place"
741858,gordy28,2012-11-03 11:07:00,638,Loving the old reports Chris I'm researching our 2014 trip so it's really helpful and helps stave off the winter blues Have you ever been to any air Cochrane or white River air camps Cheers Gordy
741863,solopaddler,2012-11-03 11:22:00,8605,"  I have flown with both. Both offer good fishing, but between the two I'd give the nod to WRA. Nicer lakes, better cabins and much more interesting terrain.  The only reason I don't use WRA all the time is because they're quite expensive.  For what they're charging I'll generally drive a bit further and fly out of Nakina instead.  If you have any questions about specific lakes shoot me a pm."
741865,SirCranksalot,2012-11-03 11:40:00,3291,  From what I've heard it is notably devoid of hookers!!
741866,gordy28,2012-11-03 11:41:00,638,Thanks Mike generous offer as always Will shoot you a Pm for sure. I like WRA for the cabins as well Parks based on your awesome reports is also in the mix as well Gordy
741902,Rich Clemens,2012-11-03 15:03:00,3131,Really neat to see.    Hope you have a lot more free time to push up posts like this.  I'm really enjoying them.
741918,RickOnt,2012-11-03 17:13:00,669,Chris  You mention John Rich Camps.  I cannot find ant info when searching that name. Where could I get more info?  Thanks Rick
741919,chris.brock,2012-11-03 17:24:00,4053,  http://www.ogokilakeoutfitters.com/  pm me if you want more info too
746245,wantabigone,2012-11-24 15:41:00,97,I too have been to John's cabin. The nice thing for him is he will let a group of 2 into his camp. Many places will only accept a group of 4. This was the first place we managed a 100+ fish day-all right in front of the cabin after running around the entire lake for a week.  His cabins are top notch (for an outpost) and he even has a sauna!   The only disappointing thing part for the 2 trips I took there was our inability to find big pike. We actually did catch one pike over 20 pounds fishing for walleye.  PM me as well if you want to discuss anything.
