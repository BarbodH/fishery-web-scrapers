746781,Toad Hunter,2012-11-26 17:09:00,261,"People were shocked that the crowd booed him ? well honestly, I'd like to know who the hell thought the lil turd from Stratford was in the same demographic as the CFL audience ? Just another example of how the CFL is a joke to -most- football fans I've talked to. Then again the Super Bowl half time shows as of late have been a touch off too IMO. GO FINS !"
746784,lookinforwalleye,2012-11-26 17:28:00,4399,"Argo`s played great and deserved the win, they got hot at the right time and really came together as a team!  As far as the CFL being a joke I guess your entitled to your opinion but in my opinion the CFL is a far superior game and is much more entertaining in general! Anybody find the Bills/Colts snoozefest entertaining?"
746842,davey buoy,2012-11-26 20:05:00,5505, You think Shania might of been a better choice???:I do .lol.
746859,jedimaster,2012-11-26 20:37:00,3472,"Fins fan hear, I find it difficult to stomach the CFL. I guess if I forced myself to not watch the NFL and only watch CFL I would convert after a few seasons. I mean its a bush league for washed up or not good enough NFL'ers. I would think most CFL players would trade in there jersey's for a practice squad NFL Jersey. That's the part I have trouble with.  I generally don't watch NFL half time shows either so that really doesn't come into the equation for me."
746861,kickingfrog,2012-11-26 20:38:00,8333,Football fan here.
746863,davey buoy,2012-11-26 20:43:00,5505,"Either way,we needed a Toronto big win. Far Far to long coming. Maybe the Jays will be the next big TO contender for #1. Would be nice!!."
746868,kickingfrog,2012-11-26 21:00:00,8333,Seeing the dome hopping last night was great. Hope to see it full at least for a few series next season for the Jays. And dare I say a play-off run?
746872,davey buoy,2012-11-26 21:03:00,5505, Why not? I might.
746977,Cudz,2012-11-27 00:37:00,2652,"I don't really agree with your idea of washed up nfl players in the cfl.  There are more young cfl players in the nfl.  Cfl is a great proving ground for players and young stars get noticed up here and make nfl teams. I love football in general and it is my favourite sport to watch and play. Although I didn't get drafted into the pros, I played at a fairly high level and I really appreciate the skill, speed, and strength of the nfl players.  They are truly the best of the best.  I do like the wide open, everyone in motion and big field (end zones too) of the cfl. THe faster play clock and one less down really makes it difficult to run out the clock.  What I don't like about the cfl is the amount of players and even marquis players that get traded on a regular basis. It makes it difficult for the fans to stick with and enjoy a teacm that constantly and consistently has a different group of players each year.  Aside from the Calvillo and the Alouettes, everyone just trades like there is no tomorrow. Some players have played for 5 teams in 7 years.  That is what needs to stop in the cfl."
746982,kickingfrog,2012-11-27 00:52:00,8333,Thank goodness chch has been showing James Bond movies every Monday night for the last several weeks. MNF has had a lot of dogs this year. Tonight's matchup has a combined record of 5-15.
747049,Toad Hunter,2012-11-27 05:26:00,261,"Another fins fan ?? woo hoo feel free to PM me if u ever wanna talk Fins, I'm a bit of a Finatic. I knew someone would chime in on my CFL is a joke comment, truth be told, I've heard a few people say they prefer CFL for previously mentioned reasons, I just can't stand it PUNT PUNT PUNT. But like i said too, most football fans I talk to prefer NFL hands down. As a Def. player and minded individual myself, I can see the enjoyment in the whole field position battle, just can't force myself to watch enough of it to really get into it. SIDE NOTE: anyone else find it funny though that Toronto hosted such a historic milestone of a Grey Cup ? I mean, any other CFL teamed city has FAR more fans and attendance on a regular basis from what I've heard. But maybe thats what the team needed to start filling seats. (of course couldn't hurt that that made and won it too I'm sure.)"
746650,Twocoda,2012-11-26 00:21:00,4130,Not sweating it ...we have to give toronto their handycap...just to keep the game entertaining...
746660,Christopheraaron,2012-11-26 00:58:00,3525, Lol! I'll just flip to wfn for a few mins
746661,Christopheraaron,2012-11-26 01:07:00,3525,Good after first half

746669,Christopheraaron,2012-11-26 01:37:00,3525,Yup.
746671,jedimaster,2012-11-26 01:38:00,3472,If anyone is really stuck for a feed post back here I can stream the game if you really need it.
746672,glen,2012-11-26 01:38:00,2641,People that stutter don't like it either.
746673,Twocoda,2012-11-26 01:39:00,4130,lets just say i wont be running out to purchase any of his music....im damaged goods now that i seen that halftime show  edit to correct photo 
746675,Gerritt,2012-11-26 01:40:00,6129,  is it Beiber free? I will pay a subscription fee for a year.... if I never see justin or that moron from mariana's trench again lol
746676,Gerritt,2012-11-26 01:42:00,6129,"  Lennon,Yoko and Pierre.....  Bieber wearing overalls with Harper? what have we become.....  God help the Bieber nation."
746679,jedimaster,2012-11-26 01:51:00,3472,"I shut it off for the halftime show, sounds like I didn't miss anything, lol"
746685,Handlebarz,2012-11-26 02:01:00,3790,I had it off for burber but the wife and kid girl in the house turned it up and took remote that is 3 min of my life lost.
746688,Christopheraaron,2012-11-26 02:04:00,3525,Lol Mike! Same thing for me.
746693,Handlebarz,2012-11-26 02:11:00,3790,Damn I gotta head to bed work will come early tomorrow wish I could stay awake longer. Looking forward to reading this thread at 4am or when I am sitting in my truck.
746709,Twocoda,2012-11-26 03:14:00,4130,ok 17 seconds left and im feeling a lil heat...lol....Congrates to the Argos...well deserved
746722,Cudz,2012-11-26 04:14:00,2652,"Game was good. Glenn was not.  Glad the double blue won!! Ok I am not as old as some of you so here we go.  Gordon lightfoot - whatever.  Looked like he was dead.  Not really impressed at all. Mariana's trench sucked large. Carly Rae Jepson (sp?) whatever. Not very entertaining. Bieber was at least entertaining to watch.  Put on the best show of the 4 singers by far.  Not even close.  Other than his saggy crotch pants, I thought he was good. Overall it was a weird mix of really old (lightfoot who is like 74 and caters to 60+ year olds I guess) and really young (the other 3 performances, probably catering to 10-17 year olds.)  Not sure they hit the mark with performance choice.  Nothing for the 25-50 year olds, which probably makes up most of the viewers and atendees of the game.  Odd"
746736,davey buoy,2012-11-26 08:50:00,5505,Congratulations fellows!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Well done.
746738,Handlebarz,2012-11-26 10:06:00,3790,That was a fast read lol.  I guess we're back to good old winternet.
746750,jedimaster,2012-11-26 12:59:00,3472,www.tsn.ca/cfl/story/?id=410291  Clearly bieber was a bad choice. He didn't even do any interviews with any canadian tv stations. America can have him...and i'll throw in a bag of pucks to sweeten the deal.  Now that cfl is done can we have the nhl back please? I forced myself to watch a soccer game last week.... one team got 1shot on net the entire game. Game ended 0-0 I tried watching a few marlie games but I just cant do it.
746757,Fish Farmer,2012-11-26 14:31:00,2234,"Lets get rid of NHL, bring back good old Canadian hockey and make it affordable to go CHL Gordon lightfoot was great to see and can still hold a tune. I hope I can still hold a rod at his age."
746594,Gerritt,2012-11-25 21:14:00,6129,well no TSN here..... Nor can I add it UGH.... Anyone have a online source to watch the game?  Thanks! G.

746599,glen,2012-11-25 21:21:00,2641,There is going to be a lot of disappointed people if it is only on tsn.  If there is a little ice on the field the can play for the Stanley cup too.
746600,tb4me,2012-11-25 21:33:00,3295,this link worked for me..May be gone by game start thou..Justin tv is quick to shut down the feeds....  http://www.justin.tv/argosfan#/w/4246486768/7

746608,kickingfrog,2012-11-25 22:03:00,8333,All CFL games have been exclusively on TSN for a few years now.
746614,Gerritt,2012-11-25 22:12:00,6129,Yup sucks ....
746615,fishdawg,2012-11-25 22:13:00,912,tsn.ca  isnt live streaming?
746617,Twocoda,2012-11-25 22:28:00,4130,Here ya go ...this site is very reliable...one of these links should work fine http://www.wiziwig.tv/broadcast.php?matchid=176045&part=sports
746628,Handlebarz,2012-11-25 23:27:00,3790,I don't use U.S. satellite as I like to many programs from Canada and would miss them if I did not have it. But I guess with the Internet you can get just about anything very cool.
746630,kickingfrog,2012-11-25 23:34:00,8333,Why watch it from tsn on line when you can get it from a sketchy website?
746632,Handlebarz,2012-11-25 23:44:00,3790,Dang 1st play 1st turn over

746638,i2cool2fool,2012-11-25 23:56:00,349,I sometimes listen to NASCAR races over my satellite radio while puttering out in the garage. I used to listen to hockey.....  Sometimes it's just as entertaining over the radio.
746639,Gerritt,2012-11-25 23:58:00,6129,  aerial footage only.... no scores no commentary.
746640,davey buoy,2012-11-25 23:59:00,5505, Use to work late and listen to hockey or baseball in the car on the way home. Wasn't to bad now that you mention it.
746641,Handlebarz,2012-11-26 00:04:00,3790,I love to listen to ball games NASCAR NHL on the radio it's even better when you know who they are talking about and use your mind to fill in the pictures.  I was not pleased at all with the anthem did he mess up and do a crappy cover up or just that stupid to make changes and add words and leave others out?  I am not a sens fan but love to listen to the OPP officer sing it there he should always do it.
746642,Gerritt,2012-11-26 00:06:00,6129,Thanks to (you know who you are) for the link.... working great!

746646,glen,2012-11-26 00:16:00,2641,These eyes are crying after that anthem. Hope Gordon does better.  Good game so far.
746647,davey buoy,2012-11-26 00:19:00,5505, It's getting better and better!!!!!
746649,Handlebarz,2012-11-26 00:21:00,3790,I'm sure beiber will make the half time well worth a trip to the store to get well anything.
