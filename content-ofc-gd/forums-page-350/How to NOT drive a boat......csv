745681,jedimaster,2012-11-22 03:10:00,3472,The first one is awesome. You cant train that sort of syncro in any dance or acting class.

745702,Hooked,2012-11-22 05:20:00,891,The woman in the green bikini held on like a champ though.  And that first remix vid is mint!
745786,Burtess,2012-11-22 19:59:00,901,All that and no tops came off  And what was that dude doing with the throttle lol....  on/off/on/off/on/off  Burt

745842,Banger68,2012-11-23 00:24:00,157,That lake is nuts. Like the 401 on water. Good LB fishing though.
745855,danc,2012-11-23 01:18:00,4677,"I've been on Lake of the Ozarks a few times. A buddy that I met at Kansas Speedway has a ""lake house"" there. There's so much boat traffic on that lake, that even on dead calm days there is 3 to 4 foot waves coming from every direction. Just crazy!"
745892,Stoty,2012-11-23 03:07:00,2910,"Apparently he failed his ""boaters exam""....    AMEN brother, what a tool behind the wheel!"
745893,danc,2012-11-23 03:14:00,4677," You don't need a boating accident to see bikini tops off on Lake of the Ozarks. When you get into some of the party back bays, there's more tops off than on. They don't call Missouri the ""show me state"" for nothing. Just saying..."
745903,Cudz,2012-11-23 04:00:00,2652,Lol.  Been in worse.  haha
745921,pikehunter,2012-11-23 11:18:00,1659,Don't see the humour in it. The guy at the helm is an idiot! Actually I want to say something more to the point but the forum censors won't allow me.  Just the type of  you want buzzing around while your fishing. Too bad he didn't bust himself up real bad just to teach him a lesson.

746008,jimmer,2012-11-23 18:38:00,2730,"It reminds me of a time I was in a cruise boat with a bunch of people and the operator decided to pull a 90 degree turn at high speed without warning. I was sitting down, then on the floor before I knew it. A person riding in the boat has no control once the operator loses control, you're at the mercy of......"
746032,aplumma,2012-11-23 19:37:00,6896,  Yeaaa everyone knows this has happened no where else but there.....    Art
746219,fish_fishburn,2012-11-24 13:42:00,1311,I would also bet money the bass boat pilot was inexperienced. His bow was way to light when he was approaching the camera boats wake. If i'm not mistaken that is a Triton he was running and those things are pretty flighty at WOT to begin with.
746492,northernpike56,2012-11-25 13:33:00,717,It was one of his first times driving his boat.
746495,solopaddler,2012-11-25 13:48:00,8605,I didn't any aspect of that video funny at all. Different strokes I guess.
745556,adempsey,2012-11-21 19:30:00,1498,
745557,BillM,2012-11-21 19:39:00,17367,There's a boat in that video?  I didn't notice
745560,davey buoy,2012-11-21 20:01:00,5505,"That can happen so easy at high speeds,once the captain's out of the helm,,couldn't help but notice the interior..Hope everyone was alright."
745563,jedimaster,2012-11-21 20:08:00,3472,Should I feel bad for laughing at this video?
745564,Grimace,2012-11-21 20:11:00,2020,"Absolutely not.  It's great, I like how the captain's glasses pop up after he hits the floor."
745566,davey buoy,2012-11-21 20:14:00,5505," Is it normal to put a camera up front looking back while your out for a cruise?,maybe,it was a bit funny I must say!"
745570,Joey,2012-11-21 20:38:00,9122,They're all damn lucky to be alive!!  Still made me laugh tho
745572,Hooked,2012-11-21 20:52:00,891, I couldn't stop laughing.  They got tossed around like rag dolls!
745579,F7Firecat,2012-11-21 21:42:00,347,lol the yellow bikini babe gets a face full lmao
745585,glen,2012-11-21 22:25:00,2641,I told you to sit down.
745587,Muskieman,2012-11-21 22:47:00,2472," Yes ! Why are they standing ?, Dudes sitting in the back seem to be fine .. I laughed as well ... I like the pilot , stiff as a nail hitting the deck ... No pity from this guy. ."
745588,backbay,2012-11-21 23:00:00,773,"Hmmmm, wonder how long this guy had owned his boat when this happened......... I demonstrated my compassion by only watching the vid about four times....."
745589,Roy,2012-11-21 23:01:00,13728,"Yes it is funny. When you think that one or more might be a son, daughter or grandchild....then it's just scary."
745596,woodenboater,2012-11-21 23:22:00,2277,"These people were SO lucky. Could easily have been more serious injuries, esp the girl who goes face first into the dash."
745599,irishfield,2012-11-21 23:27:00,26272,"Did she say ""filmed live by our own lake TV crew""?"
745601,Muskieman,2012-11-21 23:43:00,2472," I thought of that Roy .. But still , had my son / daughter / wife , old pal , come home with a black eye , goose egg or busted wrist , and then seen the video , I'd a laughed "" why were you standing ?"" keeps coming back , had he come home ( funeral home ) it would've been a different story ... I think these people all came out OK in the end ... Seems to be the inexperienced pilot and stupidity's fault ... maybe even an over zealous camera crew is to blame . "
745602,GreenCanada,2012-11-21 23:44:00,375, I couldn't agree with you more Roy. I'm surprised so many people find this amusing. I personally know of a few friends and others who made bad decisions and it cost them their lives...  That was a terrifying video to watch.
745603,glen,2012-11-21 23:46:00,2641,Ha look at that big wave. Lets see how much air we can get.  They did get good air.
745605,glen,2012-11-21 23:52:00,2641,Terrifying would be watching it live. Nothing you do about it now. Might as well watch a see where they went wrong.  If you go airbourne in a boat do it straight so the boat don't hook.
745618,fishindevil,2012-11-22 00:28:00,6254,Man that's scary !!!!! Could have had a terrible outcome !!!!! Luckily they were not killed !!!! .....
745623,iFish4real,2012-11-22 00:34:00,386,lol...see what happens if you're not wearing your seat belt
745626,limeyangler,2012-11-22 00:38:00,5204,almost peed watching....funny as hell
745652,livinisfishin,2012-11-22 02:25:00,661,Made me chuckle
745656,jedimaster,2012-11-22 02:28:00,3472,"The more I watches the more I laughed. I mean seriously lets hit one wake, and gun it into the next one. A hook is the only outcome. Lucky the force didn't rip there bikinis off."
745666,adempsey,2012-11-22 02:37:00,1498,"Of course, being the internet, there are some remixes of it.    "
