On another note  he and his partner brought in a 5 fish weight of 29 plus pounds!! "
745070,Skud,2012-11-19 05:03:00,739,What a piggy. That would be like catching a stump. What a thrill that would have been to catch. His heart must have stopped when he first laid eyes on that beast at the end of his line.

745980,Stoty,2012-11-23 16:27:00,2910, Didn't want to piss anyone off!!!
745982,capt bruce,2012-11-23 16:35:00,820," LMAO  >>> Pound for pound Smallies are by far the hardest fighting fresh water fish out there.. What a tank must of given you a fight to remember,only good thing I can think of for Gobies are Damn smallies grow HUGE on a diet of these things .. Great catch guys .."
745983,EC1,2012-11-23 16:39:00,930," Well Stoty, give a little bit of product insight and I'm sure no one will be upset  What is your general rule for using the 3 different slammers (Fat, Normal, and the Slim one)?"
746336,GBW,2012-11-24 22:35:00,8460,I think I would have wet myself a bit with a PIG like that one on my line!
746367,Familyfisherman,2012-11-24 23:54:00,188,"Fantastic fish!  My friend caught an 8.2lb smallie a couple weeks ago on Simcoe.  The picture is on another board, but he was by himself, so it isn't very good.  Such a difference in fish once they get much over 6lbs...just huge!"
