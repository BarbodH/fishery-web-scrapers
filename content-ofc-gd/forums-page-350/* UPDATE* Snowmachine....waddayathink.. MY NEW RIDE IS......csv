744887,Sinker,2012-11-18 16:25:00,8692,I still like the tundra myself.  You get that bigger sled stuck and you will be wishing it was a tundra.  Just my opinion.  S.
744896,Tybo,2012-11-18 17:10:00,1373,"Simon,I have a the expedition le with the 600sdi engine and it will go any where.Two flip up with all the gear for three and three on the sled was not a problem. I can break trail in deep snow.Slush hardly slows me down and it still lifts the skis and is quite fast.It`s a great all round sled."
744992,limeyangler,2012-11-19 00:12:00,5204,"  I hear ya Sinker...but I think it's a trade off between more likely to bog down in slush on the tundra but relatively easier to get out as opposed to less likely to get stuck but harder to get out when you do with the Expedition.   Hey Paul, what are the specs on your sled...track length...weight....hp?"
745002,Terry,2012-11-19 00:36:00,14456,"I have seen Tybo with 3 people on his and towing 2 huts behind, like they weren't even there"
745006,Tybo,2012-11-19 00:39:00,1373,"It`s 127in long x 48in. Ski stance is 40in. Weight is 630lbs. Track is 20in wide x 156in long 1.25. It has a ripsaw track on it and very wide skis. It is very comfortable to ride. I don`t know what the HP`s of the engine,But it`s more then enough. It`s a great sled. You should get one. You will have no worries out there. I`m thinking of studding the track. But it will cost a small fortune too do it right."
745039,Sharkbait22,2012-11-19 02:35:00,297,"Not a 100% on this.  Most sleds >500cc will not have too many problems in slush.  I say this because these sleds can move fast enough to stay on top of the slop.  Now if you need to slow down, you will sink and start ploughing.  A light sled with a large surface area contacting the snow (hence the numbers I posted earlier) likely means lower speeds while staying on top.  Imagine water skiing. Powder is one thing, slush is another.  Often they come hand in hand, particularly early in the year when the weight of the snow pushes down on the ice.  At the end of the season, travel earlier in the am when the slush is more frozen and hope for the best on return home â€“ or wait until it freezes at night again.  A big lug track will eat the slush but rougher ride on bare ice."
745078,limeyangler,2012-11-19 09:35:00,5204," I wish i could be more confident of the 600ACE.....but i dont want to buy what will be the last sled purchase for a long ...long time and end up underpowered.  The E-techs do seem nice and really rip as you say....even though they are good on gas i think the market is heading in the 4 stroke direction. 19mpg on a 1200 is good enough for me.    Thanks. I checked the stats.....its actually the E-tech that needs premium.     Thanks a million Paul....same track W/L as the 2013.....the 4 Tech 1200 is 35lbs heavier than yours. Fantastic to get your input....actual rider reviews...cant get better than that. It really looks like a great sled....will call some dealers on Monday morning...see what they can do.    We dont get much bare ice here, plenty of snow right up till a couple weeks before ice out. All i know is that i am getting a lot of feedback sugesting the 600ACE may be a little underpowered...maybe fine by myself not towing anything...but with a 3 man flip up with 200lbs+ of gear and a passenger...not so sure.  Like i said my old XLT (600lb) could power through some insanely deep slush with a passenger and my flip up.....only ever got stuck once...that was from a standing start.....as long as you pinned 'it as soon as you felt the slush...you were good....so i'm more confident and practised at avoiding slush hazards the horsepower way.....the 4 Tech 1200 has plenty of HP and some awesome flotation with the 20""x156"" track...not to mention the articulating rear suspension for backing up in deep snow (slush?).  I dont want to get too obsessed with the 'slush' factor in my decision making process....but since i dont 'trail ride' and ice fishing is what its for it high on the list of essential capabilities.  It does not harm that it is reprted to ride almost as nicely as a touring model, my wife and jack will appreciate that.    I'll be fine then.....the wife hardly ever comes out with me and i dont think i even have as many as 3 friends....lol"

If buying a sled myself I'd likely go that route too.  Bravo with no suspension is starting to kill the back... that Tundra is the next step up with some more engine and creature comforts.  About $3500 more though...  Don't like the Tundra seating as much and wish they'd either extend it or make some sort of cargo feature to the back but hey, you'll be riding smooth on a good engine.  Rotax has been decent for me in the past.  And if towing your gear that'll do just fine.  You'll be loving the snow this year."
745460,Bernie,2012-11-21 02:12:00,3190,"Ernie is right on. That 1200 4 stroke has been a terrific engine. I was doubtful of it when I first seen them in the sleds, but even the serious trail guys are using them now. If they come into the shop at all, it's usually for maintainence or chassis work, not the engine itself."

742617,dhickey,2012-11-08 01:12:00,1038,Well I certanly would not be intrested in starting a sled with a string at 7.30 am when its -40 combine that with cold ellectronics(fuel injection) and you would probably be going back into the cotage for a coffee and warm up you hands along with a few choice words along the way. Just my (exp) thoughts.
742618,limeyangler,2012-11-08 01:29:00,5204,"  I am getting a block heater for it, carrying jumper cables wherever i go( i know no use if i am alone), there is an onboard charger available as well as battery blankets."
742621,dhickey,2012-11-08 01:47:00,1038, Sounds like weight might become a problem? That also would make the sled harder to handle in most off trail situations.? Its always nice to be prepared for any forseable problem but when the going gets unexpectedly hard lighter is better not only that but sacrificing perfomance for the sake of (what if I need it)can get you in trouble.  travel lite thats my motto in the winter.

742653,ecmilley,2012-11-08 12:12:00,2163,"43 inches is not skinny, as for tippy many of the modern rider foward designs may appear tippy because you are sitting higher and with sleds built the last 15 years for the most part actually have suspension travel (i remember my 433gpx with a whopping 3 inches of travel if that)they handle better ride better, skandics or tundras are made for bushwhacking ice fishing running trap lines ect and are about the lightest of the utility sleds available it's a good choice enjoy it"
742655,F7Firecat,2012-11-08 12:40:00,347,"  Two pulls and a efi sled will start in the coldest of weather, 1st pull sets the efi for the conditions second pull it fires up, no fumling with the choke or throttle to get it to go like the old carb models"
742844,limeyangler,2012-11-09 03:45:00,5204," I give you full permission Bill...right up till the point the piston pops out!    Eever since seeing the venture lite a few years back i wanted one....but over the years i have been leaning more towards a utilty type sled. The viking looks good as do many other brands that make utility sleds...i just think the viking/bearcats/IQ600Widetracks/Skandics are overkill for what i want a sled for.   If i get it Ben you will for sure see it out on Bull...cant wait to try the GPS out on those depth contours we found.    good to hear, gives me a little more confidence to hear other people think this sled is a good choice.    Will do! I am hearing some good things about the ACE600    Yeah......i mean its rare i go on long excursions alone....but dropping the sort of cash i will be....i really dont want to have niggling worries about anything! But i am researching the options to lower the risks of being stuck out on the ice unable to start your ride home!  LOL.....Thank goodness you were there that day to unstuck the purple beast from el slusheroony....i was soaked....lol...GOOD TIMES!    The ski stance on the Tundra is actually 32"". Expedition looks nice too.     We dont have that much choice up here....you are lucky."
742845,limeyangler,2012-11-09 03:45:00,5204,"  Good to know Sinker...i think i'm getting closer to getting one.    Its actually 11"" skinnier than that ...32"" to be precise...do you think that will be a problem?    It does not have pull start...any pull starting would be an attempt to get the clutch to spin with a belt or piece of rope."
742852,mikemcmillan,2012-11-09 04:35:00,50,"I will second the long tracks, I have a 96 ski doo grand touring, geat for all around use and 2006 Yamaha Venture Tf with a 151 long track, this thing will pull a house. I have always been a ski doo fan but you just can't beat the reliability of a 4 stroke Yamaha.  Alos I think the ski stance on your new sled is 42 not 32. I don't think you will find any sleds out there with a 32 inch ski stance, maybe the old elans.  either way you will love the technology of the new machines. a pic of my Venture, I can't wait for the cold & snow.  Have fun with your new ride. "
742854,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-09 04:44:00,10439,"Simon That stance is pretty skinny. I thought you may have been mistaken but checked the site and it is indeed 32"" on the Tundra and the Skandic isn't much wider at 35 and change.  If it were me, I would get one of those Yamaha Venture Lites. They have a 43"" stance (the same as my Venture GT). Much more stable and I haven't really had any issues in the bush getting around with the extra width."
742869,ecmilley,2012-11-09 11:51:00,2163,"the skinny stance is fine if your into some back country boondocking, there that skinny so it's easy to lay on its side but not most stable ride, if your breaking trail in the backcountry and there is lots and lots of base this is what there made for. lots of choices out there for utility sleds. i am a yamaha fan but a rs viking is a 700+lb beast with a 151x20 track that will go anywhere but around 15k, both skidoo and polaris have some decent priced utilitys in low to med power ranges"
743040,Sharkbait22,2012-11-10 14:32:00,297,In the end you need to ask yourself if you will be  1) riding on lakes 2) riding on trails 3) riding long distances 4) breaking trail  The first three mean a comfortable heavier higher hp sled would do.  Remote lakes where few go mean a lighter sled because you'll be on your own to dig out when you get stuck.    A light sled helps you not get stuck but also get unstuck easier.  Know how to get unstuck.  There is also riding technique to avoid getting stuck.  http://www2.snowmobilecourse.com/wisconsin/study?chapter=5&page=15  Just for my own interest here are the mass to surface area stats for different sleds.

743142,limeyangler,2012-11-11 05:19:00,5204,"  Ok , I have to admit i have no idea how those numbers translate into stability on the trail/lake etc.  What i can say is that the criteria you list are exactly what i have been mulling over since the beginning of the 'sledquest'.  I had a touring model before so am familiar with the stability of a wider ski stance machine. I also appreciated the comfort factors.  I dont really travel too far but that could change so it has to be reasonably comfortable.  I carry passengers regularly so 2 -up is a must.  Weight of the sled is definitely a factor...so the lighter the better...i got my old touring model stuck a few times both on my own and with company.....not fun to get unstuck in either situation.  As far as breaking trail goes...i dont. But thats only because i never had the sled to attempt that....I would love to have that option with any new sled i got....that is the main reason i am leaning (no pun intended) towards the Tundra LT   I love the Yamaha's but dont want to go with the heavier touring models. I have always loved the venture Lite, and always thought that would be my sled if i ever found myself in a position of buying a new or newer sled. However, now i am in that position and i actually started to research whats available.....while i still like those models i am liking the ACE600 more than the 499CC of the yamahas.   So.....why oh why cant the Tundra have a slightly wider ski stance!!!!!  I am not at all worried about the 'tippy' factor if it was just me riding....i would learn to adapt and no doubt become a better and more confident rider when i mastered the technique. What worries me is having my wife or child riding with me on a tippy machine.   So another option is the Expedition Sport...with a ACE600 thrown in, adjustable ski stance of 38.4"" or 40.1"" with a more conventional suspension and the same 16"" x 156"" track as the Tundra....its a 2-up touring utility crossover...and still pretty light at 537lbs (Tundra is 505lbs). Only thing is there does not appear to be anything for the passenger to hold onto...and no grips option for that model in accessories!!!!   I'll tell you what though....gotta love this forum...so handy to have all this help and advice while trying to decide on my purchase...AWESOME....thanks"

I thought i was going to get an Skidoo Expedition Sport with a 600ACE engine (4 stroke).  However, I noticed while doing some research that the ACE600 might be a bit underpowered at 60hp. This was confirmed to me by a good fishing buddy from Kenora, he has info that the performance of that engine...while outstanding for its class, performed more like a 400.  60hp is not feeble by any means....but i just fear SLUSH! I want to have the power to get through with my hefty Otter 3 man shelter and a passenger.   Anyway.....I kinda ended up back looking at the utility sleds.....heavy but powerful with lots of flotation.   I'm kinda leaning towards the Expedition LE Rotax 4-Tec 1200   Not much heavier than my old XLT (67lbs heavier to be exact) but it has 130HP (40 hp more than the XLT). Granted it is geared differently and I wont be hitting 90mph......but i'm thinking the xtra HP and the 20"" x 154"" track and wide skis will deal with heavy slush as good as if not better than my old XLT (15""x133.5"").   Advice here would be good....i need edumacating on the horsepower thing....is more HP even with less speed capability going to mean better possibilities of 'POWERING' through slush?   What I have realised is that to get my 'perfect' sled that will do everything i want it to i.e.Lightweight, 2-up, on/off trail/breaking trail capable, fuel efficient, good stability and slush friendly, I can Have just about all that except the 'lightweight' aspect. To offset the weight go for power is my train of thought."
744850,lakerguy,2012-11-18 11:35:00,224,"Dont be afraid to look at a 600etec...lots of power compared to the ace.I thought about trading up my 2011 renegade 600etec to a 1200 renegade but the the thing that stops me is the 1200 in any configuration just seems like a tank imo. We just purchased a renegade 600ace and brought it home yesterday,couldnt resist ripping it across the lawn....the little ace rips for a 60 odd hp sled. If i was in the market for a sled for what your looking for it probably would have the 600etec in it...great on gas(approx 350 km per tank)doesn't stink like the old 2 strokes,does not use alot of oil,makes decent hp."
744873,ecmilley,2012-11-18 15:06:00,2163,"yes hp will power through slush, don't be worried about the bit of extra weight from the 4-tech it is a bomb proof engine easily outlast the chassis while the e-tech is the top of line 2 stoke it is still a 2 stroke and engine life can be a concern, double check the stats as well think the e tech requires premium fuel"
742299,limeyangler,2012-11-06 01:22:00,5204,"Hi all,  Thanks for all the advice and debate folks. Quite the journey deciding what to get.  Started off looking at Bearcats...Yammies and Skidoos.  Liked the Skidoos....liked the Skidoo 4 stroke 600ACE engine.  Thought about a Tundra Longtrack, a bit too tippy with the narrow ski stance.  Thought about an Expedition Sport, wider ski stance.  Got to thinking about power and after listening to a few folks here and elsewhere decided it might be a bit underpowered for either of the above models( particularly thinking about getting through slush with passenger and 300lb+ flip up shelter)  Was liking the idea of long and wide track, just not convinced the 600ACE would suffice. Looked at the next Expedition up with the 1200cc  4-Tech ....looking good.  Got some positive feedback about it from some members on here and a good fishing buddy....  sourced one in Winnipeg....  got a relatively good deal...  finance now in place.....  pick it up on Thurday with a new Triton aluminium trailer.   Looks like i will have to wait at least another 5 years for my quad....but oh well...at least i will have a nice ride for 4 months of the year.

742326,blue pickeral,2012-11-06 09:48:00,267,"Pay the extra money for the ACE600. About two years ago BRP decided to modify the 550 fan to meet emissions targets. This caused some of them to blow up within 300 miles of running. Motors were leaned out and there were problems with oil delivery systems not set up properly or no oil at all. One dealer was installing a thicker head gasket on new machines to make up for some compression problems as well.  The ACE is a very quiet, fuel efficient engine with plenty of power, certainly better than the fan. No blue smoke. You can stand beside it while running and talk to someone in a normal volume of voice."

Yup.....snowmachines insurance is not cheap (pro rata )"

My Alaskan friends have been able to start their SkiDoo ACE600's down to -40 without plugging in. I generally don't ride when it's -40 as it's too hard on the equipment."

742448,ctdd2006,2012-11-07 01:40:00,531,Tops on my wish list.  Enjoy!
742550,ecmilley,2012-11-07 21:26:00,2163,"stick to the 4 stroke it'll outlast the chassis, when it comes to there 2 stroke BRP means Bring Rods and Pistons"
742555,Old Man,2012-11-07 21:36:00,822,"That will be a big improvement over your old sled Simon.  Less likely to get extremely wet with that one  ""The only thing that is worrying me is no pull start..."" That would be my only concern as well, knowing the out of the way places some of us get to. I've never tried to manually start a cold 4 stroke, so not to sure if it should be a concern or not."
742559,ecmilley,2012-11-07 21:48:00,2163,well i can start my 1000cc yammy 4 cyl 4 stroke off the primary with a small flat belt no problem if i have to can't see it being much of a problem with a 600cc 2 cyl
742563,DRIFTER_016,2012-11-07 21:58:00,10439, I've never even thought of trying to pull start my 1000cc Yammy and I don't even worry that it would ever need to be. I also sled in much more remote places.  Note to self: put old belt in sleds emergency kit.

742615,Sharkbait22,2012-11-08 01:02:00,297," I have a 380 Skandic 2-up and it is a bit tippy on some surfaces. It just takes a litle more active riding - moving around on the sled to balance it. I rarely go much over 40-60km on lakes and less on trails while towing an otter sled. More stable with two people. The narrow ski width (43"") helps me a lot while moving through the bush. I really wouldn't worry about it. My next sled will be another Skandic or Expedition.  BTW my pull cord riped out last year while 30km or so from anywhere. Luckly I had some rope!"
