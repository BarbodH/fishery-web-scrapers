746226,Christopheraaron,2012-11-24 14:15:00,3525,Pretty sure it's private all the way around...
746241,CRAPPIE,2012-11-24 15:26:00,213," Hi Chris  Thanks for your information, I heard some members had their canoe fishing during the summer time, I know most of the place in this lake is private but got to have some access to the lake since they don't own the lake.  thanks again"
746246,Christopheraaron,2012-11-24 15:43:00,3525,My understanding is that it's like preston lake in the way that it's managed so yes it's public but you have to cross private land to reach it so unless you parachute in I don't think you can.

746321,GBW,2012-11-24 21:58:00,8460,"is that you ""ponny-boy""?  LOL!  Don't waste your time fishing that lake at all.  That is unless you want your car damaged then towed away then hey, go for it.  They don't like people that don't own land there..."
