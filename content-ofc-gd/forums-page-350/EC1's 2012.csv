745306,EC1,2012-11-20 07:16:00,930,"Since barely anyone posts reports anymore, let's just all do a 2012 summary. Summary for my year so far...  Blade baits are golden during the coldwater months    Can't seem to find any spring crappie fishing pictures.... Got a few here and there. Nothing special. Fished for walleye once as well.. Had a few decent fish but no PB's  Got better at fishing for lakers and whities   Jigging for softwater lakers is very similar to ice fishing for them    Figured out how to use a flipping jig(Never got anything over 3 with them though  )   Flipped all summer but got my biggest largemouth on a jerkbait in the early fall...   Fished the OBF this year, and embarassed myself big time.  The dropshot is my #1 Technique.... USE IT MORE.   Found the effectiveness of a football jig   Fall smallies are my absolute favourite thing to target after September. Here's a PB at 6+.   Put a few of non fishing friends onto a few days of decent fishing.     Goals for 2013 - Catch a 5+ Largie - Get better at jigs - Barely did any fall crappie fishing for 2012... Maybe get a few trips in for next year - Learn to fish crankbaits and swimbaits better"
745313,Live2fish85,2012-11-20 12:11:00,1633,Nice Report EC1.  Looks like you got some nice dishing in this year. That's a nice chunk of largie you got on the jerkbait.

745369,young_one,2012-11-20 17:41:00,620,Some new goals to consider for 2013 - spend less money on TW. - don't feed musky $25 jerkbaits
