He died sometime in 1990s and not much of his work is available these days. I would hold onto that print. It may not be worth much artistically in value, but he did qualitiy drawings and they are a nice addition to any wall."

In the last picture you see a printed page inwhich  goes on about his life and his anbitions and he was also a great song writter from what is written. His full name in english name is Fred Greene Sr. from Shoal Lake Reserve. I will try and get a better picture of his Art story and post it.If I have to I will type the words from it. I am not thinking of it as a money maker thing,but as a true native print that I am happy to have now. Thanks for your reply very much."
