Few hours of fishing produced 5 fish and lost 2. Only couple other boats out there. Fish were between 7 and 15Lbs. Spoons only. Tried dipsy, tried flies - no luck. And of the spoons the watermelon produced the most. Took a while to find them but then the show was on ;-) Best bite was around 150 fow down 60'.  Here are few pictures for your viewing pleasure:          Cheers, Ice Fisherman"

75566,icefisherman,2007-05-27 02:53:00,952,"Wayne,  I'll gladly trade you ALL I know about Lake O., Lake Erie and Lake Simcoe for the extremely useful info you are giving me about Temagami. I just want to learn more and more about fishing in different waters. And here is a real offer - any time you come down here to the Big Smoke and feel like fishing in the big water let me know few days ahead and we'll do it in my boat. Weekday or weekend - no problems.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
