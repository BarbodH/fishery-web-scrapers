I had my 5 year old distract a parent and I took out 2 kids and we found our spot to fish...hehe.  Seemed there was an OFAH event there....a ""Take your kid fishing"" day.  Wish I knew about it...it was just ending as we arrived.  Before long, I brought in this crayfish...it had a stranglehold on my worm!!!   My little one pulled this nice on in...there were a few kids watching her...at least 3 or 4 years older than her, and they all yelled....MOM!!! THIS LITTLE GIRL CAUGHT A FISH...LOOOOOK!!!!  PUT A WORM BACK ON MY HOOK!!!!  Guess they figured if a little kid like that can catch one, then they could too...little do they know my little one outfishes me!! haha.   I thought I was all prepared...she had sunscreen on, had snacks, water, even toiletries.  Then shortly after her sunfish, she started scratching...she had about 5 nice welts...courtesy of the local mosquito population.  She wanted to leave....all the way back to the car I heard ""Daddy...why didn't you bring the bug spray??""  Oh well, next time we'll be more prepared!!! LOL"
