75030,cthewrld,2007-05-25 13:26:00,99,I am at home recovering from a heart attack and would like to get out close to home to do some fishing.  Can anyone provide some feedback on Lake Wilcox?  I have been led to believe there is Pike fishing in the lake.  Any and all feedback is appreciated.
75068,bigbuck,2007-05-25 15:02:00,2449,"Supposedly there are some pike as well as bass in the lake. Try some live bait with a float, I don't think you'd want to be casting for hours on end since you are recovering from a heart attack. Good luck, a buddy of mine bought a house up there and is looking forward to carrying his rod a couple of blocks to fish."
75072,bowshep,2007-05-25 15:17:00,378,l to had a heart attack and lm glad l did. My life is what it is but different.Its what got me fishing again and the little stuff l use to get ticked off at wasn't so important. Good luck take it slow in this heat and drink lots of water. Peace Ken

But the crappie comes out at night, and I am not sure if others are allowed to fish there at night either. It is too weedy to fish from shore, as well. A small inflatable boat is advisable in this lake."
75204,Shaky,2007-05-25 20:50:00,25,I haven't fished it in years but when I did it was for bass.  We would just wade in and cast.  Good lake for bass but we never caught a pike but I guess they are in there.
75257,Baptiste,2007-05-26 00:13:00,37,Was Lake Wilcox outfitted with an underwater oxygen generator? I seem to recall something...I pass Wilcox and Bond every day and wonder about the the possibilities.
