75279,irishfield,2007-05-26 00:54:00,26272,Wednesday night they had reopened the highway from Sudbury to Timmins so hopefully it's still open for you fnf  And as for that Tornado...we left Halfway lake that morning for Hearst...good luck on our part..for a change.

The MNR still had the area barricaded off and were doing hot spot checks on foot and by helicopter. First time I have ever seen any thing like this and it is very sad to see our resources and country side damaged like this."
