75564,wmshaw,2007-05-27 02:46:00,42,Heading out fishing for whities tomorrow in the J.P. / Sibbald Point area and was wondering where a good place to park and launch my boat would be located.  I was thinking of launching from Sibbald Provincial Park and a friend suggested Bonnie Boats.  I am very familiar with the launch in Virginia Beach where I normally go out for perch and its about a 10 to 15 minute run over and so I just wanted to know what the other places are like for launching / parking and the respective costs.

75790,wmshaw,2007-05-27 23:16:00,42,Well I decided to launch from Sibbald Point Prov. Park this morning and I must say I really liked the launch there.  It is a nice concrete ramp that can easily accomodate 3 boats launching at the same time and the best part was the cost was only $11.00 which is considerably cheaper than parking and launching at Virginia Beach.
