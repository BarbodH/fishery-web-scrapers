Ended up with about a dozen nice male walleyes all about 14-18 inches, another dozen mooneye, and a couple big channel cats.  Took home my limit of walleye (4 here).  Dropped off some fish to Grandma and Grandpa and called 'er a night.  Not too shabby!"

Also, what did you catch them on? Jig and minnow? Husky Jerk? If so,what colour/pattern etc.? Just trying to learn here.  Oh I bet the grandparents were pretty happy. That was a very thoughtful thing to do. Obviously your Grandpa was an avid fisherman? Wish I had grandparents still."
