He decided he'd make the trek out our way to meet up with bly and I!  He's a great guy to fish wish...even brought coffee and timbits!  We tried 3 different places and the end result was no big fish.  I brought in a few bullhead...that's it! The first place we went, the waters were just MUD!  Tried another place and suddenly the winds picked up BIG TIME and we could barely cast. Before we knew it, it was past midnight!! Turns out that we work in basically the same building in Toronto...small world.  It was great meeting him...you can tell from his posts that he's a class act all the way...we're glad we had an opportunity to fish together.  Maybe next time we'll catch something!!!  He took a pic of one of my catches...maybe he'll post it later...."

The small world stuff was scary (we work in the same building and he knows a guy I went to University with).  Your both a load of fun and very friendly and I can attest that you really put in the work and deserve all the lunkers you land but when they say they don't always catch huge fish - their lying and here's the proof:  <a href=""   title=""Photo Sharing""><img src=""http://farm1.static.flickr.com/241/515109304_35f1f789e6.jpg"" width=""375"" height=""500"" alt=""cliffsgiant"" /></a>  Was a fun night even though I apparently would have been better off going with their daughter the next day - I think she's the true fishing guru in the family   Look forward to fishing with you both in the future."
