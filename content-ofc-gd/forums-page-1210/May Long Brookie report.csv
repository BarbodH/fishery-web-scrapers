74213,Guest Johnny Bass,2007-05-23 02:00:00,0,"Excellant report and scenery. If it wasn't for the COLD winters, I would move up there!!! And I did see the same star next to the moon, though they looked alot closer together down here!"
74216,mepps,2007-05-23 02:07:00,1301,I hope it warms up by friday - we will be passing through TB.
74227,tjsa,2007-05-23 02:28:00,1578,"Nice thought Mepps, but.............NOT, cooler temps all week, with rain in the forecasts, if ya can believe the wheater quackopractors."
74265,Moosebunk,2007-05-23 04:10:00,3970,Very nicely done Dan.  I feel ya on the chilly part.  The pelican shot is different eh...?  Caught a few brookies of my own but just waiting for my guest to type up the report.  Have a great season.
74268,Mike the Pike,2007-05-23 04:14:00,3421,Nice report Dan thats one frosty boat you got there. \When its cold there are no bugs and one can always dress for the cold. MTP
74372,easton13th,2007-05-23 15:28:00,371,"WOW! The ice, I can feel the cold in that pic!  Congrats on the persistence and the fish.  Easton"
74373,tbayboy,2007-05-23 15:33:00,1497,"Hey Dan, looks like your buddy was right about Venus:  http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap070523.html  ""The conjunction was captured in the above image taken from near Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Venus appears on the lower left of the above photo. """
74480,Guidofisherman,2007-05-23 22:54:00,206,"Great report Dan. Excellent photos....they bring a lot of good memories. I have only seen pelicans on Onaman Lake but never on Nip. I know the cold of May long! Good for you and ""C"".  You seem to have done well considering the conditions of the weekend."
74489,tjsa,2007-05-23 23:06:00,1578,"Hey Al, why are we not seeing a report from you this May long, or were you saner than the rest of us, and just stayed home,   :lol:  :lol:  :lol:  :lol:"
74579,Guidofisherman,2007-05-24 02:58:00,206,"For once  I came to my senses and stayed home. The weekend up here was brutal as Dan's pictures show. The tarp on my boat was so frozen, I couldn't open it to load the boat. However, I have been doing a bunch of steelheading last month on local rivers and am now wrapping up with a few dropbacks. I have had the good fortune to get out over a dozen times. Give it another week or so and I'll be hitting the speck scene. I just didn't want to ice fish for them.

74892,danc,2007-05-25 02:22:00,4677,"Thanks so much for the fantastic comments guys and gals. It's those type of comments that keep people motivated to put the time together to put such posts on the board. So keep them coming for all reports. Sorry about the late reply, but I had to head out of town Tuesday morning for a job at a gold mine in Marathon. There's a few people that had queries about my post that I'll be replying to through pm's. bucktail, Pam and tjsa to name a few. I'll be getting back to you guys within a few days. Guidofisherman??? It's time to go Bud. See ya out there."
75692,fishindevil,2007-05-27 17:49:00,6254,"Great report and pics dan,you guys went through hell & back,and it payed off,well done...and i didnt know that about those pelicans..  .hmmm thanks for letting us know....cheers"
73719,danc,2007-05-21 23:29:00,4677,"If you've already read tjsa's report, then you know that it was unseasonably cold up here for most of this past weekend. But it's nothing that we haven't seen before.  When you live ""up north"", the May long weekend can be 30C or -10C. This year much of it was -10C. I arrived at the lake with the boat in tow an hour or two before my partners were expected. They'd be pulling a camper. I thought that this would be a great opportunity to launch and go and catch a fish or two before they showed up. But when I looked out at the lake from the launch, I quickly changed my mind. A wicked wind was blowing right towards the launch churning up major white caps and stinging any exposed skin. I parked the boat on shore for the night and when my partners arrived, we set up camp and discussed fishing tactics for Saturday. However, this is what we awoke to Saturday morning.    Snow, freezing rain and those same biting winds kept us huddled in the camper for which turned out to be the entire day. A few games of cards and a couple of short walks kept us entertained for Saturday. On one of my walks, this guy flew up into a tree right in front of me. He was really chowing down on buds from this tree.    The skies started to clear on Saturday evening. This was a good sign for Sunday. My buddy said that this was Venus beside the moon. I wasn't sure.    Sure enough Sunday morning greeted us with clear sunny skies, although the wind still had a bite to it. As we gathered our gear together to launch the boat, we were treated to a rare sight. Two flocks of Pelicans circled over our camp site for about 10 minutes. I'm not sure if you guys have them in Southern Ontario, but they are a rare sight up here. They are awesome flyers. They reminded me of the Snow Birds the way that they were grouped in tight formation and their precision maneuvers were nothing short of amazing.    Finally to the fishing. We had to work for them, but we did ok. We ended up with about a dozen Brook Trout from about 14 to 21 inches in size. They were pretty good scrappers considering the 38F to 41F waters temps  that we caught them in. Here's a few fish pictures to round out my report.              I hope that your long weekend was at least warmer than ours."

It was only nice here on Saturday, then the wind ruined Sunday's fishing and the cold ruined Monday morning's fishing.  I'm sure you had a great time shootin the  tho eh!  Joey"

73862,ccmtcanada,2007-05-22 11:18:00,7971,Dan...great report!!!  The pics were great as usual too.  That was venus...was down at the lake and a star gazing club was down there with their telescopes...they told me that was venus...and they were offerring free peaks thru their equipment.  It was pretty cool.  Wow...those pics and temps remind me of my trib adventures in January!!  Crazy cold out there...but you guys fished anyways and were successful...now thats perseverence for you!!!  Thanks for the report....made me glad I dont live up there....LOL
73900,Roy,2007-05-22 12:42:00,13728,"Another beautiful report, Dan. Man that does look cold though. Your pics are exceptional."
73906,misfish,2007-05-22 12:49:00,29133,That pic of the boat would make a lesser man stay in bed.LOL  Nice report and pic bud. TFS.
73960,Puckhead,2007-05-22 14:29:00,377,"Great Report - man, you have one heck of a skilled eye with that camera - some of your shots are just brilliant!"
74006,tjsa,2007-05-22 16:51:00,1578,"D-D-D-D-Dan, you look c-c-c-c-cold,  Nice report btw, great pics as usual.  Wasn't too bad for us walking through the bush, everything was frozen to the branches all day, and we had our rain gear on, and the wollies. Guide icing was a problem, but easily solved, the water temp was warmer than the air temp, so sticking the rod in the water and swishing it a couple of times cleared the guides, sometimes leaving rings of ice on the line. But they broke quickly. One other problem I had was the line freezing on the spool, and had about 4  tangles, but got all of them cleared.     Glen, how can y'all stand it down there in all that heat??  Yes, we have white pelicans migrate up here every year. They are on Nipigon Lake, Black Sturgeon Lake, a couple of the other larger lakes near Nipigon, as well as Lake of the Woods, probably quite a few more also. I have seen them occasionally over the years, but never got anywhere near enough to them to take a decent picture, they are wary birds."
74012,fatherof3,2007-05-22 17:06:00,1769,very cool pics.thanks for sharing
74018,Entropy,2007-05-22 17:12:00,747,"Hmmm, and I thought I was cold laying on the lawn watching fire works.  Yikes!!"

74117,pameladallaire,2007-05-22 21:13:00,470,"Thanks for sharing your pics Dan.  We had the same weather.  I have a question about photographing wildlife with my new digital camera.  Should I be using manual exposure to get the correct lighting or do you use an auto setting.  Now remember, I'm a complete beginner when it comes to photography.  I just can't seem to get the lighting right.  Pam"
