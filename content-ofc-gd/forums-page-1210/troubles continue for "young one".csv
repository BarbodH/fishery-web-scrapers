They were offered help by a few people willing to tow them in after they were observed paddling home last weekend and they refused it...go figure. It seems they had killed thier batteries while trolling around Quinte. This is second hand but reliable info. again go figure. we learn by our mistakes. Can any of you remember when you got your first boat......"
75342,irishfield,2007-05-26 04:51:00,26272,Yep...was 7 years old..4HP Merc on a wood boat my 14 year old brother built.  Wouldn't doubt if they had a battery isolator that got wet and is toast...and batteries aren't charging. Just a shot in the dark...

The problem back then I believe was that ""red safety switch"" not set to proper position. Run/Off, it was in the middle As for the progress of our new boat, it's just taking a some time for the shop to finalize deals and installations. Again, nothing is finalized until I see the new boat on my drive way. I'll inform everyone as soon as I hear anything from the dealers."
75628,Guest Trophymuskie,2007-05-27 13:03:00,0,I remember renting a small boat with a 4HP from a local bait shop to go fish for a weekend. We actually were going to Deer Rock lake for some that know. We selected the best camping spot on the island and then we motored to the far end of the lake to fish. Well if we didn't have mechanical problems that had us spend 3 hours rowing back and ruining our weekend. Come to find out all we had done was break a shear pin. We didn't know any better and even so no spare was provided.  We did get another weekend rental from the shop owner.
