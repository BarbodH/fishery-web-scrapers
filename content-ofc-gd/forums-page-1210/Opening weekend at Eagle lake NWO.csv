75480,grt1,2007-05-26 22:12:00,638,"I just returned from the annual meeting (fishing,drinking, eating fest) of our Eagle Lake Hookers Club on Eagle Lake just west of Vermillion Bay.  Opening day saw rain,sleet,snow and wind. It was pretty miserable for fishing. I managed to get a 34"" lake trout the day before and on opening day I got a 23"" walleye (that was released) and a couple of eaters . This is unusual since opening weekend is not generally the time you can get the walleye in Eagle to bite. I guess the early spring and warm temps for the 3 weeks before the opening had warmed the water enough to get the walleye a little more active than they usually are for this time of the year.  On the Sunday I got another lake trout  that was 30"" and this one was in 8' of water where I was looking for wallleyes.  Monday produced another couple of eater walleye and a pike.  When we hold our annual meeting the main point of the whole thing  is the friends getting together to share a few pints (quite a few actully) and relax for a weekend. By getting a line wet and getting some fish was just a bonus."
