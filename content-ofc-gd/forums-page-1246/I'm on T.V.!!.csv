51581,Beans,2007-03-25 15:24:00,3339,Just caught the 10:30 repeat...Great show and you did great on it...
51787,Loonietoon,2007-03-26 00:49:00,1450,Great show Tony.. you should be proud of that show... Always watch the show with Arron & Barry.. I find it very informative ... there are not to many shows any more that take and spent the time to explain things. The only other ones are Shaun Rickard's Urban Outdoors and Charlie Wray's Fishful Fishing Show. These are the Shows for normal people in normal fishing areas that we can all get to.  Just my opinion and i'm sticking to it
51795,snag,2007-03-26 01:06:00,1932,"Wow Tony,  What a beautiful fish. I love it's tail.  Missed the show but I'll catch a re-run!"
51809,Pigeontroller,2007-03-26 01:40:00,2793,Good show!
51816,luv2drift,2007-03-26 01:51:00,147,Hi Tony I want to Fish Niagara with a centre pin ...What do you recommend gear wise and location wise?and I 'll be tuning in!
51900,tonyb,2007-03-26 12:46:00,1637,"Thanks for the kind words everyone,  I really did enjoy myself and always do when out fishing (How could you not?).  I remember when I got the call from Aaron... Aaron: Hey Tony, do you want to fish the lower Niagara tomorrow for Steelhead? Me: Heck yeah! Aaron: We'll also be filming for one of this year's episodes, is that ok!? Me: HECK YEAH! What will I have to say and/or do? Aaron: Nothing in particular, let's just go fishing, say what you want to say and we'll try to capture it on film.  Needless to say, it was great having no pressure and I just blabbed on all day about everything helpful I could think of.  (Although the tip I did on the baits took a few tries to get right without me smiling like an idiot the whole time or fumbling the words  Doug, you noticed that snarl of line!? hehehe  It just goes to show that those kind of things happen to everyone, I think that's a big part of the fun of fishing too when that sort of thing happens, can't be too serious! If you pay attention at the end of their episodes they try to include something funny like that on each show.  For anyone who missed the show, you can catch it on http://www.gettinghooked.net/Episodes.htm  Tony"
51921,Mike Pike,2007-03-26 13:51:00,1332,"Hey Tony, I caught the show on the weekend and didn't even know it was you until I read this thread!!!  Well, how cool is that!???  Congratulations Bud!  Some beauty fish you caught and an you came across really good on camera.  You have a good nature and attitude about you and I commend you on your stream rehab work with the club.  You definately deserve that spotlight with Aaron.  Congratz."
51926,Joey,2007-03-26 14:00:00,9122,"Awesome Tony, I missed it so I'll watch that when I get a free moment today.  Thanks  Joey"
51966,Marc Thorpe,2007-03-26 15:16:00,621,"Great show Tony and Aaron,enjoyed it very much"
51969,valerie,2007-03-26 15:28:00,83,"Nice Fish, caught most of the show i liked the double netting didnt know who you were but you sure did look like a pro."
50445,tonyb,2007-03-22 13:43:00,1637,"I was fortunate enough to be able to film an episode with Aaron for his show Getting Hooked with Aaron and Barry for Niagara River Steelies!  You can catch it on OLN this Sunday at 8:30am or 10:30am and then available online on their website after that.  If you haven't experienced drift fishing from a boat for Steelhead on the Niagara, you won't want to miss this episode.  We cover a lot of the basics and even manage to catch some fish.  The fish were quite acrobatic that day but I am not sure how much of that the cameraman caught on film as I would imagine it is difficult to capture those first leaps when you hook a fresh Steelie.  I also caught my biggest steelhead of the year, twice in the same day!  The biggest one came near the end of the show on a double-header, what a hog!  Hopefully I don't look like too much of an ass on T.V.  Check it out    Tony"
50447,Joey,2007-03-22 13:49:00,9122,"Awesome Tony, I'll be sure to tune in.  I'm sure you took a pic of your steelie with OFNcommunity.com for Team 2 right  Joey"

50456,suds,2007-03-22 14:12:00,70,"Cool, I'll be sure to catch it as well.   Nice fish Tony!!"
50566,bpsbassman,2007-03-22 17:50:00,941,That's awesome Tony!
50650,martymonty,2007-03-22 21:30:00,26,What is OLN? is it on basic cable or can it be seen on the net?? anyone know? I'd love to see this show
50661,GbayGiant,2007-03-22 22:01:00,1780,"Wow, thick tail on that one."
50663,Roy,2007-03-22 22:14:00,13728,"Way to go, Tony. I'd recommend this to anyone...sight unseen. Aaron, Barry and their team do an excellent show. Looking forward to viewing that episode."
50685,tjsa,2007-03-22 22:58:00,1578,"Nice fish Tony, and I am sure you will not be an ass on the show, you will be like any other angler enjoying the spoils of a successful fishing trip. Hope I am at home when it is on, my vcr's are shot, so I cannot record it, and I may be out fishing when it is aired. Guess my best option is Getting Hooked net, and downloading it, if I remember to do so, lol."
50691,Smokey,2007-03-22 23:12:00,1278,Cool I'm home this weekend and will be watching for it.
50703,Bernie,2007-03-22 23:51:00,3190,Good for you Tonyb.   Looking forward to watching it.
50705,tjsa,2007-03-22 23:56:00,1578,"If I wake up early enough,   I should see it, going out fishing saturday, 2 hr. drive, both ways, plus the fishing time, ooohhhhh, I am gonna be sooooooo trashed sunday morning."
50721,fishersquige,2007-03-23 01:03:00,52,Thats awesome!!!

50737,DT10Sam,2007-03-23 02:08:00,480,"Great job Tony, uuuuuuuummmmmmmmmm where is the OFNComminity.com sticker  Regards, Sam"
50753,ccmtcanada,2007-03-23 03:02:00,7971,Tony...I'll be sure to catch that show for sure!      You can bet that if you did look like an ass on TV that someone on here would be sure to let you know....lol.
50756,motv8tr,2007-03-23 03:14:00,2587,"Seems to me those guys are good luck when it comes to getting the big ones...I seem to remember something about a Musky???  Good stuff Tony, I should be able to watch it.  Maureen"
51520,Smokey,2007-03-25 13:15:00,1278,Congrats Tony I watched the show this morn. It twas a good one.
51543,Cast-Away,2007-03-25 14:20:00,790,I saw the show and thought that you were a natural Tony! They should hire you as a consultant.
51550,Snypa,2007-03-25 14:33:00,25,watching it right now !!  wtg tony.
51552,martymonty,2007-03-25 14:37:00,26,"You seem to know your stuff Tony.....I enjoyed the show and the tips, wish it was more recent,as I am planning to go out next week for my first try at them. Will let you know how I made out, the guys I am going with have caught them before."
51562,tjsa,2007-03-25 15:00:00,1578,"I am watching it right now, missed the earlier broadcast, I was still sleeping from fishing yesterday, lol.  WAY TO GO TONYB!!  You definately were enjoying yourself. Give yourself a pat on the back.  p.s. you will notice my highlighted colour is GREEN, cause I am envious,  And, youse guys are gonna just release the little 8 lb'r first  :lol:lol  before getting the other one out of the net.  Are your arms still sore?  Nice tip on identification, so many people do not know how to identify fish, regardless of combined limits.  AND,  you got to give some tips on baits and presentations in this episode. You sounded like a natural born fishing show host, even though you were the guest.  Did I say yet that I am envious?"
51565,douG,2007-03-25 15:02:00,2693,"Very nice, Tony.  I liked how the editors left in that segment with the mother of all snarls.  Congratulations,  you speak very well in front of the camera.  No ummmms, a pro job."
51575,ccmtcanada,2007-03-25 15:16:00,7971,Just caught the 1030 episode!  You did an awesome job Tony! You'd think you've been doing shows for a long time.  Great day of fishing there awesome steel and I learned a lot as well.  Congrats!
