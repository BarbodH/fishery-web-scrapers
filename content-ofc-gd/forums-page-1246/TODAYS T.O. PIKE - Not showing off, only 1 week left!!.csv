50604,snag,2007-03-22 19:17:00,1932,"First,  Sorry Aron and Fidel my cell is M.I.A.  Second,  Yes I'm grandstanding but only because Gerritt promised me he would shave his head if I caught some pike and I never know when I can get out!  Anyways, only 1 week to be sick of my perpetually pompous, pikey 'ports.  Today was odd, Rain, warm, Rain, cold  Anyways, The pike are on..... DON'T DELAY GO TODAY!   The scoop:  Had some great follows, Lost 2 Landed 2 (1 snotty)  Water shot (there's the bargain bin lure that yesterdays pike swallowed)   Head shot (brief vertical hold right after hook was removed. Her head was quite thick)   She was plump. 2 tons of fun. Spawn is on! Yeah baby, Yeah!!   Thanks, FishheadRic Lucid Highdrifter"

It'll kill me though...if I pull a nice walleye out by accident....cause I cant post on OOS fish...LOL.  You think if I photohop it just right I can make a walleye look like a pike???
