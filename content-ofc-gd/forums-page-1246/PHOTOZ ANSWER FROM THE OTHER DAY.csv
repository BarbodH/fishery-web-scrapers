Great job Scott...just tell me you didn't catch them where you saw us earlier that night!   We only stayed out another 1/2 hour after seeing you...the wind picked up and got cold...that and the crap was floating down river and had to dodge too many pieces of driftwood.  Nice work out there!

Then I stepped in the creek sans boots, and called it a night!  NICE BOWS CC!  lol, sweet fishing"

52158,young_one,2007-03-27 00:40:00,620,"Nice catch! hmmm where can i buy some loose Steelhead roe? Clearly my Salmon roe is not working, skunked twice now. (2nd time, i learnt not every day the river will give me that ""winter grn"" colour)"
52163,canadian_copper,2007-03-27 01:05:00,925,Ã§ant buy uncured roe bro!!! its against the law!!!! jigs and pinky works well too!!
52164,ccmtcanada,2007-03-27 01:08:00,7971," CC is right, but lots of bait stores carry cured loose roe...try Gagnon's in Oshawa...they had some cured trout roe the last time I was there."
