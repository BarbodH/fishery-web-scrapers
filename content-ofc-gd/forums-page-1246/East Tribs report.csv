Thought it would of cleared up a bit after the nice weather on Friday but with all the runoff they were both still really muddy. I made the trip so I dedicated some time to the mud for a few hours..Tried out some of Jim Butley's turbide/stained water techniques I read about in his book I picked up at the show, but unfortinately still got skunked.....must of seen 30 guys atleast 3-5 at every hole and didn't see one fish come out. The fish are in but moving alot with these levels..mid week should make for some promising conditions....  Good luck to you guys that can get out mid week....looking forward to seeing some pic heavy reports as I rave in jealousy from my desk at the office !!"
