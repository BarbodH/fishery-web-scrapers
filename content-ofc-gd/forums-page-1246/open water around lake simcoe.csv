51212,Terry,2007-03-24 13:27:00,14456,"well went for a drive to see if I could find a spot to fish open water... didn't have much luck, but a bit of wind and rain with the warm weather...soon  the holland river in Bradford is melting, but not ready yet     halfway haven still frozen, but the guys are icefishing for the crappie..I didn't see any action going on     Soldiers Bay ....soild ice       canal off Ravenshoe...starting, but a long way to go before a boat can get in      same canal off lakeshore road...they are still accessing the lake on the canal      the lake access off Glenwoods beach road is melting, but people still going out    lots of ice on the lake      the Jersey/Maskinonge rive in keswick is still hard as a rock      well maybe next weekend I will find some open water perch or crappie, the search continues"

51259,Steelcat,2007-03-24 17:22:00,191,"Thanks Terry, I was planning to go to Holland River tomorrow.  But after seeing your ice condition report, I guess I'll find another spot"
51276,boatman,2007-03-24 18:17:00,350,"Thanks a lot. I was wondering if this warm weather had opened up any access, yet."

51306,tinbanger,2007-03-24 19:55:00,1028,was in Orillia yesterday the narrows haven't really started to open up yet. TB
51326,Skud,2007-03-24 20:59:00,739,"Spent morning on Cook's Bay, 16 inches of ice but honeycombed. Only a few days left of safe ice IF you can get on from shore. Caught about 150 perch to get 30 keepers."
51653,jdmls,2007-03-25 19:28:00,575,great report....I was thinking of going down to check it out soon but it looks like its gonna be a few more weeks before we have some fishable water at the bottom of cooks
51657,Terry,2007-03-25 19:31:00,14456,I don't think it will be more then 2 weeks I will be checking when I can can't wait to get on the water
