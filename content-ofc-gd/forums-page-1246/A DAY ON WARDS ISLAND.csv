51907,valerie,2007-03-26 13:13:00,83,Well here we go . Saturday morning met up with my brothers at 7:30 am grabbed a cab at 8:00 got to the ferry dock at 8:20 and we were on the water by 8:30 . Very Very cold and windy the rain didnt start till we made it half way accross. At the island it was very quiet so we decided to walk the shore to find some good spots the east side by the closed down concrete dock was frezzing and supper windy with to much ice to fish off of so we went back to the west side of the ferry dock and tried our luck after about an hour with no luck we kept on walking west along the river where we tried but nothing either as we kept on treking the rain got worse and wind kept comming we decided to have a coffee and lunch at the cafe at 11:30 . After lunch we tried a spot where the river entered the lake for about an hour also no luck so we went back to the side of the ferry dock which seemed like the best spot also with no luck. All in all we didnt have any luck on saturday the 24th but we did get to have a good day of bonding which we hadnt had for a while. The weather of the day was won of the worst i have ever fished but still alot of fun i guess that is why we didnt see anyone else fishing throughout the day untill we were leaving when we spoke to a guy that was fishing off the dock. I guess i'll have to try again on saturday which is the last day for pike have a great day everyone happy fishing.

51909,Joey,2007-03-26 13:19:00,9122,"Well that's too bad about being skunked, but as you said, you got out and bonded, which is nice.  Better weather is on the way  Thanks for the report.  Joey"
51914,valerie,2007-03-26 13:38:00,83,Probably the worst repot but very hard to report when nothing is caught. A bad day of fishing is  better then a good day at work very very true. thanks for reading my report.
51918,Steelcat,2007-03-26 13:43:00,191,"Thanks for the report   I always see a day without fish as a day for me to test new lures.  See how they swim, how they dive etc.  Of course it's always fun in the outdoors~!"
51928,valerie,2007-03-26 14:04:00,83,Very true alot of the lures i was using were new and now i know how they swim good point thanks steelcat
