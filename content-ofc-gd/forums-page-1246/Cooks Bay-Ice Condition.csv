51244,luv2drift,2007-03-24 16:39:00,147,People are out at the end of my street in Lefroy right now?  the shore line must be getting spongie.
51245,BFSC Kevin,2007-03-24 16:40:00,1351,i'm doubting it.. saw that you might need some waders if you plan on going..lol
51253,ccmtcanada,2007-03-24 16:53:00,7971,Hard to say...temps for Barrie and area are going to be hovering around 10C during the day and above freezing at night too...
51255,nelly,2007-03-24 17:05:00,256,"I was hoping to get out in the mid week and do some perch fishing around Roches Point but not with wader's. Still early but I feel Team 3 needs to on the the board first, those dinks could give us some points as a start."

51334,luv2drift,2007-03-24 21:24:00,147,I just walked down to the end of my street people are out there(four or five) I am pretty sure they are americans renting in lefroy ...and they are absolutely out of their minds if they think it is safe. the ice has turned for solid black ice after that melt and freeze up two weeks ago and now is that dull spongy white/grey and the shoreline is melting fast!.
51619,jdmls,2007-03-25 17:17:00,575,great report....I was thinking of going down to check it out soon but it looks like its gonna be a few more weeks before we have some fishable water at the bottom of cooks
