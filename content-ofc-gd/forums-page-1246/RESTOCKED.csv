51616,jdmls,2007-03-25 17:00:00,575,"yup got to agree with Scott ...the riverwoods are hard to beat !!! I am surprised to see to see your confidence in white !! I have been confident in the pinks and purples as far as vibrant colours, but haven't given that much dedication to white jigs. I guess I am gonna have to spend a little more quality time trying em out.  cool idea with the LED floats !!"
