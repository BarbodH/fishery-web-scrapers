51601,Handlebarz,2007-03-25 16:05:00,3790,I have been looking for a bit now at different fishfinders and think this one might be right for me I was just wondering if anyone has used it before and how did ya like it? its only $199 at Wallywold in the USA so I figure that is pritty good for what I need.
