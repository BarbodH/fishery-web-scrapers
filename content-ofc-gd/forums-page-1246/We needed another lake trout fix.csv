Out onto the lake, and it was mostly slick ice, with a few snow patches, my sleigh tried to pass me a few times, lol.  Checked out one place my co-worker mentioned, cause he lived on this lake for years, but no one had fished there for quite some time, so off we went in search of a place someone else mentioned. Found the general area, and started drilling holes and checking depths, we were looking for 45-55 feet as that is where they had their success.  Ahhhhh, March 24th, 1C, and sunny.     My bud showing his dad how to use a Vexilar, which he borrowed from a bud.    Didn't manage to get a pic of my buds first fish, I was busy fishing myself, but took a long range photo of one of our fellow anglers nearby, one of our local CO's, practicing his ""use of force"" training on his first trout.    My second fish of the day, and an increase by one inch for team 8    My bud using the vexilar, it helped him land his first fish, but the other 2 he landed, it probably would not have had any impact, but he did have 3 other fish follow his jig for a few minutes, teasing them up off bottom about 10-15 ft. before they lost interest.   My bud putting the boots to his second keeper, lol.   My buds 2 fish he kept, he landed one more, but the pics of it being landed are on his camera.   I managed to complete my limit by 10:40 am, and spent a little more time jigging, and of course, boiling up deer sausage, and we called it a day at 2 pm. Unfortunately by buds dad missed the only fish he had hit his jig. But he did enjoy being out, since he had knee surgery back in september, and this was his first fishing trip since August."
51353,canadian_copper,2007-03-24 22:19:00,925,GREAT REPORT!!!! TX FOR SHARIN BRO!!!
51355,camillj,2007-03-24 22:22:00,1988,Nice going TJSA ... I woulda liked to do that today ... I am thinking there's no more ice at Lake Joe .. could be wrong though
51359,tjsa,2007-03-24 22:29:00,1578,"Ice is going to go fast up here if the forecast can be believed. Almost needed my auger extension 2 weeks ago, now its only 24 inches. Lots of evaporation occuring today, was quite wet when we drove off the lake, and on the way back home, lots of lakes had lots of water on them. And, we are supposed to get rain for the next 2 days, that will diminish ice thickness fast. Hopefully, we should get out one more time, but there might be walleye fishing in boats before the season closure, lol."
51360,brookieman,2007-03-24 22:39:00,68,hey are those Codet Wool Pants  your buddies wearing?
51363,Daplumma,2007-03-24 23:04:00,1961,"Good job bud,Whats for dinner? Joe"
51370,tjsa,2007-03-24 23:09:00,1578,"They are wool pants for sure, and I believe they are Codet, I own the same ones, but they are not here at present for me to confirm. They are still in my rack bag on my quad, which is at my buds place. I did not need to put them on today, no need. But, wool pants are THE ticket for fishing and hunting in cold weather. Today, is the first day ever, that I have not worn them when out fishing or hunting, they were just not needed for me today. And, I have been wearing wool pants for years out fishing and hunting."
51371,tjsa,2007-03-24 23:12:00,1578," Ummm, walleye actually, I gave one trout to my neighbor, and owe the other to my sister and bro in law."
