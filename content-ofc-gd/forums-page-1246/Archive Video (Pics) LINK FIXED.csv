51976,Basskicker,2007-03-26 15:45:00,421,Sorry about that.....wrong link. I found this new program to turn my pics into a slideshow....so I thought I'd try it out. Some of the pics are repeats and some are new...not much a selection of music to pick from but oh well.  Does anyone know of a similar program?  http://s105.photobucket.com/albums/m210/Ba...nt=fa24a091.pbr  Thanks for letting me know Jen  Jason
