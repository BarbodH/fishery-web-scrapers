51460,Whitemikeca,2007-03-25 04:08:00,138,I guess I should introduce myself since I haven't posted to this forum since last summer.  My name is Mike and I am a CA from Toronto.  I just got back into fishing last summer.  As a child I lived in the Peterborough area and I used to fish practically everyday but when I moved to T.O. I stopped fishing.  Last year I started back up again and I mostly rented boats and fished the Kawarthas for bass and muskie.  I posted a couple of reports of these trips on the old forum.  Once I put my rods away for winter I just couldn't shake the urge to go fishing.  So a couple of months ago I puchased a decent used boat(15ft and 50hp) so I wouldn't have to rent this summer.  I figured it was also time for some nicer equipment so yesterday I went to JB's and grabbed the following.  A Calais 200 for bass and a Calcutta TE 300 for muskie.  Now I just have to somehow find a way to pass the time until the Tri-lakes opens up for the season.  I will probably head down to the island tomorrow to test out my new gear so hopefully I can post a report for you guys.

51463,silveradosheriff,2007-03-25 04:15:00,1025,Welcome back - you'll definately enjoy those fine pieces of equipment!  :-)
51465,kennyman,2007-03-25 04:22:00,737,Phew!! Nice new toys. I sure would love to have that Calcutta. Happy fishing.
51467,Whitemikeca,2007-03-25 04:31:00,138,"Yeah I can't wait to try them out.  I have a question about oiling the reels.  I have some quantum ""hot sauce"" oil that I bought for my old baitcaster.  I am wondering if anyone knows if it is better that the standard oil that comes with the Shimano reels?"
51488,Roy,2007-03-25 11:11:00,13728,"The Hotsauce is really good stuff but the tube of Shimano 'sauce' that came with the Calcutta should last you several years. Good purchase, congrats."
51547,The Urban Fisherman,2007-03-25 14:26:00,2050,in my dreams!!!! SWEET new toys...  TUF
51556,Smokey,2007-03-25 14:44:00,1278,Congrats nice purchase and welcome aboard.
51592,Jen,2007-03-25 15:46:00,833,"Ok, there is a tad of jealousy...  Welcome back Mike, I look forward to seeing how your day went with your new toys!  Cheers, Jen"
51597,Slowhand,2007-03-25 15:52:00,13,"Oil that comes with Calcutta will last longer than Hot Sauce. However, Hot Sauce is more viscous. For heavier lures: stay with the Shimano oil.  BTW Nice reels: (I have a Conquest 201 DC: absolutely incredible reel) and a Conquest 51 that I added ZIP ABEC 7 bearings (my favourite for pitching light lures): 2 of my favourite reels."
51642,bucktail,2007-03-25 18:42:00,1857,Sweet!!
51678,irishfield,2007-03-25 21:00:00,26272,Nothing like a trip to JB's !! Thankfully... for my wallet...Brian was closed by the time I was getting out of downtown yesterday.
51765,Blake,2007-03-25 23:51:00,418,Very nice reels and thye setups look great!!!!!
51774,Rizzo,2007-03-26 00:23:00,4754,"In the immortal words of Roland Martin ""ooooooo son"" Those 2 rigs should brring you much enjoyment...in half a year...alright, a quarter of a year."
51836,Whitemikeca,2007-03-26 02:47:00,138,"Well, I braved it down to the waterfront today.  Unfortunately I had no luck.  It was too cold and windy.  Both reels felt really good.  The Calcutta was really smooth and I was able to cast heavy bucktails and crankbaits extremely far.  The Calais is a monster.  I couldn't believe the distance I could cast with it.  Unfortunately it got a little windy so I had to turn on 4 of the VBS brakes.  Its going to take a little while to get used to the free spool speed of the Calais as I am used to casting with my old Citica 200.  The fishing and the weather sucked but I was still worth it to try out the new gear.  Thanks for the tips re the oil.  I will stick with the stock Shimano oil for now."
51844,Golfisher,2007-03-26 03:07:00,586,"Mike, given your profession and the time of the year, shouldn't you have been counting beans this afternoon rather than venturing out to test your new gear?     Welcome to OFC."
51856,Whitemikeca,2007-03-26 03:34:00,138,"Its funny that you say that Golfisher because right now I am logged into my office VPN trying to get some work done.  Luckily for me I am in the audit division and not tax so while I am still busy, I am not 80+ hours per week busy."
