Here are some photo from Humber River   Look at these hardcore anglers   Left the river and head downtown immediately at 12.  Alot more anglers than yesterday.  Saw a kid lost a pike (line broke) right before my first cast.  After fishing for 3 hours, there wasn't even one single bite.  From what I heard, two kids got a 41 and 37 inches pike earlier in the day, and another guy got one as well.  I guess I shouldn't go to Humber River and should go straight to downtown.  By the way, where did the sun shine and the +10 C went as forcasted by the weather channel?  It was +2 C when we arrived, and the sky was worst than yesterday.  Even with the rain yesterday, we could still see the whole CN Tower, but today half of it was ""gone""."
