51743,eyefish,2007-03-25 23:16:00,135,made it out this morning and managed to do quite well my brother and i landed 7 fish today and lost 3 others. Lots of guys but not a whole lot of fish considering the amount of guys. Almost brought my digital but the last 3 times i have brought i have got skunked so figured i wouldnt try something different today...looks like I'm onto something!  Todd
