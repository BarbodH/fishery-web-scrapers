51741,muskieb,2007-03-25 23:12:00,58,"We went out yesterday out of Port Dalhousie, fished from the canal down to the bar, 20ft-100ft.  Picked up four lakers near the canal on spoons but couldn't find anything else out there willing to hit.  Lakers have been hot though the past few weeks out in front of the canal, biggest one yesterday was 18lbs.  Some excellent fun to be had out there if you are just looking for some fun, some of the lakers put on a pretty good fight.  Can't wait till the salmon show up.  How deep do you normally have to go in April to hook up with the salmon?"
51750,Fishmaster,2007-03-25 23:22:00,920,17 to 40 fow ...all depends on water temps looks for the warmest water you can find ..40 deg and above is good water
