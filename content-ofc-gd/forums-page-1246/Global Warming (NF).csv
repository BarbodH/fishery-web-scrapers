47831,TennesseeGuy,2007-03-16 14:00:00,957,My friends at Red Lake are experiencing  -11 F. right now.  I doubt if they're shopping for carbon credits today.
47902,POLLIWOGG,2007-03-16 17:15:00,835,With Hugo Chevez holding the debt of the carbon credit selling nations instead of the imf and wb I would think the carbon credit system is all but officially over.
52046,ehg,2007-03-26 18:40:00,2666, Just thought i'd bump this old thread on the hot topic today.  Would'nt hurt if we took responsibilty on a personal level to encorage a positive outlook. It would help all issues in a collective way.
47529,kennyman,2007-03-15 19:58:00,737,"Great point. If we can somehow save the rain forests,boreal forests etc. that are using the co2, it should greatly reduce the risk or at least slow the process. Our factories and power generation facilities(coal burning should be phased out not build more like the U.S.) are among the worst in the world and there's no reason for it. The factories have their emissions checked and when they are beyond allowable limits they pay the fine. This goes on every month and it's simply a matter of cash. The fine is cheaper than fixing the problem, so they pay the fine and don't worry about the emissions. It's part of the cost of doing business. Much of the pollutants can be filtered using giant catalytic convertors, but there is a cost involved. A cost the factory will never take on unless they are forced to. I know there is a fine line to walk between economics and the enviromental issues, but there are some things we can change. I believe emissions from cars are a necessary and small part of the problem, but we can even change that quite easily over time with ethanol (they should put the percentage used in regular gas up immediately to 10% and every year by a couple more percent) or even better check out this link. It's coming ..... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ry6w3mRm-FM . Hopefully more technologies such as this can save our bacon. Even if humans are not the sole cause, and I believe that to be true, we still should do what we can without turning the whole world upside down to do it. It has been pointed out that other countries such as China and India must also do their parts. Realistically they will continue to do so (keep polluting) and how are we going to stop them??? The only way is to make the solutions affordable and then by using trade embargos to force these countries into complying. We'll need a global effort to make any relevant impact at all. Nuclear technology is fine here,but very dangerous abroad. I'm not feeling very comforable about Asia and the Middle East having it,are you?There ARE solutions out there. I'm not sure the oil companies want them to come out though."
47707,holdfast,2007-03-16 03:43:00,1813,"OK I really gots to say something, ( Barely passed high school) in opposition to the Alarmists that have already convinced some or most people that the world will come to an end so to speak.  First of all when people start panicking they do one of two things.  Freeze like a deer caught in the headlights or run in the wrong direction like a chicken with their head cut off.  As much as I love Political Activists,(Ya as far as I'm concerned, get a job or if your really concerned join the military as they are at least trying to make a better world).  I really feel, that it might be too late.  Talking to my daughter (High School) I asked her Opinion on global warming.  Basically her opinion is what she seen on the Al Gore film that her class had to see in school.  Wow, we're going to have to put up with another generation of tree huggers.  So far activists have convinced  the majority, that nuclear energy is unsafe when in fact without the Russian tragedy, there has never been a death or accident from nuc power.  Its clean and cheap and ours.  As far as they're concerned, we should have wind mills  and solar panels all over the place.  Yea and even in our forests and lakes. No hunting or fishing, and eat lettuce.  Ride bicycles, build houses of straw and write on slate, no military for security, but go on UN missions and watch people get killed and massacred, because we are not supposed to show any aggression.  They've disrupted a peoples way of living in Newfoundland and the North.  Now they don't want poor countries to use their resources, lumber, coal, oil.  People (ya us) should mind their OWN business before putting demands on other peoples.  So where does that leave me.  First of all, I don't panic.  Call me selfish, but life is good now.  I did my job to help man kind ( I'm a do-er) 4 x 6 month tours lifting land mines on their INVITATION or Help. Winnipeg floods, Eastern Canada ice storm etc. I don't need to dress in green hair and dress as a wind mill smoking dope skipping school, job, or not looking for a job collecting social assistance.  I like our present government, haven't done nothing wrong yet! But there is an Opposition Idiot that may force him to do something stupid and expensive.  It really bugs me that there are two sides of things and we get plastered with what is fashionable or politically correct, sometimes we may be wrong.  Bottom line stop panicking otherwise it will be very expensive. And if people are going to publicly use statistics and Grade 3 bar graphs, how about linking us with your references.  That way some of us so called skeptical people like me can see the source of your information"

No problem! If they are willing to give me 5 to 10 thousand dollars in  rent based on generation? dude I got room in the back yard!  Live next to a nuke plant? yo momma! Safe ? with humans involved? LOL the lowest bidder gets the contract?  Down here they are still arguing over where they are going to store the spent fuel safely, could cost billions. The states with nuke plants don`t want it stored in their states, nice huh, we will put our pollution in your state?  Yes there are two sides to everything, wait till a problem occurs to try to fix it? Might be too late? We need to do a bit better job of maintaining our home?"
47760,Greencoachdog,2007-03-16 10:20:00,8163,"So!... the Sun is warming our globe?... who'da ever thunk it!!!  Ice Ages and Global Warming... everybody talks about the weather, but nobody ever does a damn thing about it!!!"
47765,Deano,2007-03-16 10:55:00,767,"Man caused the continent's to seperate. Man caused the deserts of the earth. Man caused the ice ages. People, it's an ever changing world, always was, always will be. The same people who are wrong about the weather 50% of the time 365 days of the year. Funny what people will believe. Most people even buy bottled water nowadays. If there's a way to make a buck, a good salesman will sell it. I guess if you beat a drum long enough, people will march to it. Funny, the world has survived for billions of years, man comes along and it ends in one hundred years. Soon we'll be taxed for the air we breath, sounds crazy now, but years from now people will be having the same debate."
47774,OhioFisherman,2007-03-16 11:20:00,6623,"LOL I used to buy gas for 31 cents a gallon the taxes on it are more than that, I bought a brand new dodge tradesman van in 1973, 3100 bucks, I bought a brand new split level home in December of 1974 for 28,900.  LOL Man has changed all that! It takes a lot longer to fix things after they screw them up?"

47265,bigfish1965,2007-03-15 02:24:00,3382,"First..Mars' mean surface temperature is -63° C. The polar ice caps are primarily made of frozen carbon dioxide which makes up 95% of its atmosphere. The seasonal changes to Mars temperatures allow some freezing and thawing to occur. It is never warm enough to melt water ice. The average temperature of the earth has risen 1.44°F over the last 100 years and 1.08° over the last 30 years. (Source:NASA) Sure, one and a half degrees sounds like nothing until you try and figure out the amounto of energy that would take. The top five warmest years in the last 125 years have all been in the last decade. Global warming is predicted to cause more EVENTS...not just of the warm variety. It provides the energy for bigger and badder storms. The top years for hurricanes and tornadoes have all been in the last decade. The US saw more tornadoes last year than any time in its recorded history. tornadoes need storms with energy...energy equals heat. Last years hurricanes fizzled because of El Nino countering the trade winds and driving the storms out to sea. To dismiss Global Warming is foolhardy at best. To believe itis the end of mankind is also foolish. But, there can be no dispute we are warmer than ever before."
