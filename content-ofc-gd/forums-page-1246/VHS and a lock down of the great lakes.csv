[emailÂ protected]  We just heard Ringwood stalking will go ahead as planned, which is good news. As Cronzy would say, GIVE EM HELL."
52097,mattyk,2007-03-26 20:55:00,2110,this is a serious topic. The potential implications could be serious. Very sad to here indeed.
51258,outdoorguy61,2007-03-24 17:16:00,220,"I am aware that some of the walleye groups are being jacked around.  I have also been told of at least one group being given the message that they would be trout getting eggs from Sault Ste. Marie, as opposed to Normandale. I was puzzled by that....is Normandale not online at the present time?  I wonder if the eggs collected for commenercial interests are affected. My hat is off to any native community hatchery interests that will likley not have to put up with any sillyness.  outdoorguy61"
51308,aniceguy,2007-03-24 19:57:00,1094,All rainbow trout production was moved to the sault that was a shock to me yesterday also.
51428,jjcanoe,2007-03-25 02:22:00,744,sorry double post  jjcanoe
51430,jjcanoe,2007-03-25 02:23:00,744," What they might be trying to accomplish with this point is:  Guy works at a hatchery and goes out for a few casts in the morning before work, catches an infected walleye of pike (remember the symtoms are not always visible) heads to (MNR or club) hatchery and handles fish or uses the same set of waders/boots/gloves/jacket covered with some VHS infected fish slime, and inadvertantly transfers the virus to the hatchery fish or a different watershed while out collecting eggs.  (yeah I know it's a stretch but it could happen)   All Rainbow and brow trout that were formerly at Normandale are now at the S.S.Marie hatchery.  Normandale will be strictly for raiseing Atlantics as of last fall.  Our club got our brown eggs early last winter from there and the hatch rate was amazing!  Rainbow eggs are coming soon. Our colllection permit expires at the end of March and we were out on Thursday collecting.  We got about 20 'bows from about 300m of stream ranging from 3-14lbs all the males were ready to rock but the females were different.  The large ones were still green (except for one) and the small ones were all spent. We ended up with only about 2000 eggs so the rest we'll be getting from S.S.Marie (if the MNR lets us!  jjcanoe"
51496,aniceguy,2007-03-25 11:40:00,1094,jj did your biologist not tell you to not collect gametes this yr.
51502,Handlebarz,2007-03-25 12:18:00,3790,this is all apart of the same things as the minnow ban I had brought up. It starts in one place and will not stop until we make our voice heard.   Why is it that most of the info we have to go on comes from the USA our MNR is not doing enough and that is not there fault they have been cut to very dangerious extent.  It seems that people did not care much a couple years ago when Gobies and drum died off or the big muskie dieoff of the St Lawerence then LSC. I do know that all the Sh!$ will hit the fan if we have a huge pickeral or pearch die off then we will get the support from the GOV.
51513,the captain,2007-03-25 12:58:00,2,GUYS HAVE A LOOK AT WWW.SPOONPULLERS.COM THERE IS ALOT OF INTEREST ON THE STOCKING OF FISH AND VHS AS A MATTER OF FACT IT IS FORBIDDEN AS OF LAST WEEK. WE ALL BETTER START LOOKING INTO THIS MESS.AND GET ON THE PHONE AND COMPLAIN.
51609,outdoorguy61,2007-03-25 16:34:00,220,"This needs to go ""public"". For those in MNR reading this, it usually sends shivers up their spines. Sadly I am too far away to do much with work, otherwise I would likley do the job myself.  outdoorguy61"
51766,jjcanoe,2007-03-25 23:53:00,744, We didn't get word of this until after we were done collecting for the day and got home to check E-mails.  Were were then told not to worry about it but hold off any future collections until furthur notice.  We don't have any plans to stock our brown trout quite yet but will do so when hatchery and donor stream temps are about equal. (as long as we are given the OK to do so) The rainbows won't be going anywhere for a while yet so they hopefully won't be affected.  jjcanoe
51768,aniceguy,2007-03-26 00:05:00,1094,sad to hear.
