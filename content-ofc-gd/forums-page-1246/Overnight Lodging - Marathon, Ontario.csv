51955,fishbait,2007-03-26 14:45:00,23,I am planning a stop in marathon for a little sleep.  Any motels or hotels that anyone has info on close to or right on 17.
51958,troutologist,2007-03-26 14:56:00,951,White lake lodge is about 15 minutes before marathon. They only have cabins but a one bedroom is like $60/night and you can fish right off the dock. You cook your own food though. Right on hwy 17
51959,douG,2007-03-26 15:06:00,2693,"I'd stay at the Marathon Harbour Inn, (807) 229-2121.  It's right beside the Prime Cuts Restaurant, and they offer highspeed internet access and a continental breakfast."
51962,irishfield,2007-03-26 15:11:00,26272,"There is, or at least was, a couple motels in Marathon. Many times full with construction/firefighters/etc though.  http://www.town.marathon.on.ca/"
52106,bigbuck,2007-03-26 21:19:00,2449,"There's 2 hotel/motels right on 17 across the street from each other. They're ok, definitely not Hilton's but decent for the money. Also, there is a PetroCan and restaurant that is owned by the same guy on the north side. The restaurant is pretty good for brekkie. We stayed there 2 years ago on the way to Kenora."
52115,danc,2007-03-26 21:39:00,4677,I usually stay at the Zero 100. It's pretty much right in the center of town. About 10 minutes off the highway. It's modern and clean. It has a restaurant and bar as well.
52121,Roy,2007-03-26 22:02:00,13728,"A restaurant and a bar, Dan??  WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOO!"
52137,tjsa,2007-03-26 22:40:00,1578,"The few times I have stayed in Marathon, it was always on the highway, the best western at the time, think it is still the same but don't know for sure. The zero100 is the main bar in town for sure. Always thought it was funny that the DJ had to climb a ladder to get into the dj booth though, lol. May not be the same now, haven't stayed there for over 15 years."
52157,fishbait,2007-03-27 00:36:00,23,Thanks for the ideas.  We are only staying one night and just need a place to sleep.
