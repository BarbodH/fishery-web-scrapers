52043,fishdawg,2007-03-26 18:24:00,912,"hey Jamie   $400 you can get you a decent grey-scale Lowrance/Eagle or a small colour one  - what type of fishing are you mostly going to be doing?  Flasher - hard to tell what your reffering to, but there are some fishfinders that now include a flasher page as well ( same thing as what a Vexilar or Marcum does)"
