51521,Bing,2007-03-25 13:16:00,33,I bought a new eagle fishfinder/gps last year and when I try to rename or edit a waypoint the unit keeps going back to the map screen before I can finish editing the waypoint name. Do I have to have the memory card in the unit to do this? Or is there something I am doing wrong obviously? Thanks again for your help. Bing
