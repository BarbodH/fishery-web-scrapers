51201,007,2007-03-24 12:17:00,537,Wow.  That's a beauty.  Its amazing how so many big fish in the UK are still caught with good old maggots.  I wish I could catch a perch half that size!  007
51208,mattyk,2007-03-24 13:09:00,2110,thats one big mama of a perch.
51669,fishboy,2007-03-25 20:13:00,550,"That's one honkin' perch-does anyone know the species?  (It's not ""our"" yellow perch is it?)"
51679,setomonkey,2007-03-25 21:03:00,872,"Big perch, alright...  I read the article too, interesting to learn a little about the techniques they use in the UK.  Mike"
51701,easton13th,2007-03-25 21:58:00,371,"Love the perch,,,would love even more to catch the walleye that could eat that perch."
51716,fishindevil,2007-03-25 22:34:00,6254,"WOW.....THATS THE BIGGEST PERCH I HAVE EVER SEEN  ,IS IT POSSIBLE IT COULD BE A WORLD RECORD TOO ?????     cheers"
51754,GbayGiant,2007-03-25 23:29:00,1780,"It's awesome how orange the fins are, it's also my favorite color on jigs and baits even in crystal clear water it seems to work on every species."
51761,Steelcat,2007-03-25 23:38:00,191,Holy beep~!  I wish I could catch that~!  Just imagine every single perch we caught in Ontario are at least half its size; then Ontario's anglers average weight will for sure increase alot.
