488613,troutologist,2010-07-26 19:38:00,951,"After a whirlwind of tournaments, travelling and guiding this spring/summer I finally got a chance to get out camping with my girlfriend again (last time was May Long weekend…)  After watching the radar for possible T-storms Friday, we hit the road with a promising weather report around 2pm.  Got to the lake, launch the boat and had camp set up by about 530pm.  Camp was on a small island, tucked off the main lake and away from much traffic and close to good fishing….perfect spot!!  Home for the weekend   The Boat   Alicia and pup who ran everywhere around the island at full speed all weekend, he really likes camping!   Without much hesitation we hit the water for the evening bite and found fish on a few of my go to spots, then hit tried a few new ones and found the same result.      Ready to help with the net at a moments notice….    After got back at dark and relaxed by the fire with some beer and bison burgers…a great night.  Rain started around midnight announcing bedtime, though let up around 4am.  Saturday dawned clear and calm, we got an early start as boat traffic (tournament weekend too) can be heavy. It got hot fast, no wind and no clouds forced us to take a few swimming breaks.  Again same results….the key was rigging or jigging leeches on points or humps.  They definitely had a preference for one technique over the other at different times throughout the day.   Got into a few better fish        Murphy helped me measure and release fish    Rain threatened on Saturday evening but never came, we caught some more walleye ate a late shore lunch and generally enjoyed life.  Got up Sunday, caught another pile of walleye, kept a few for dinner and had to head home early to take care of some work commitments. Great weekend, company, weather and fishing couldn’t have been better."
