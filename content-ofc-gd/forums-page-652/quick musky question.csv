While I'm going through all my gear, I thought of a question about musky leaders.  I have some fluoro leaders ranging from 12"" to 24"" and I'm wondering what lengths are preferred for casting compared to trolling.  My logic is that a shorter leader is desired for trolling, where as a longer lead would be better for casting, but I'm not entirely sure of this logic. Any insight would be a big help.  I have one more question about tactics... I have had success in the past in a current area that is usually a walleye spot, but I know some musky's move in there to ambush walleye.  There is a pretty strong current that has about a 25 foot basin and then runs right up to about 3-5 feet.  I managed to hook up with a 50""+ beauty about 6 years ago on a perch colour grandma at night in the full moon.  Other than trolling some big body baits up the current are there any other tips or lure selections I should consider when hitting this spot again?  Thanks in advance for any help!"
489077,Guest gbfisher,2010-07-28 03:39:00,0,Shorter leader for casting. Easier to cast a bait with a shorter leader and not as dangerous. Longer leader for trolling. I use a 4' lead for trolling.
489125,outllaw,2010-07-28 12:25:00,1232,we troll exclusively. the norm. is 5 ft leaders. a good snap and swivel at both ends.remember do NOT go to heavy theres a difference. some super heavy leaders will kill crankbait action.
489318,Lunkerhunter,2010-07-28 19:32:00,455,"short for casting as mentioned earlier because its easier to cast and longer leader for trolling.  as for lure recommendations, i did quite well on the french this year using an 8 inch believer."
489367,Pigeontroller,2010-07-28 21:50:00,2793,"12""-18"" for casting, much longer and it is impossible to do a proper Figure-8 or L-turn when you have a fish follow...And you will have them follow...Dam things!"
