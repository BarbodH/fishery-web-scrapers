Thanks "
488987,Fisherpete,2010-07-27 22:44:00,1814,"When the water is dirty or muddy, you want lures that make lots of noise and vibration... like the rattling crankbait you caught that one on, or spinnerbaits. Solid dark, or very bright colours should help too. Nice bucketmouth by the way!"
488992,Guest LivingLegend,2010-07-27 23:00:00,0,Man 7am to 3pm= 3 fish...... Thats a big stretch of time. All those hrs in one spot or did you venture around.......?

489188,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-28 14:17:00,0,Yep something with vibration. Like a spinner bait with colorado blades or a rattling crank bait. Chartreuse or jet black are my favorite colors for stained water. Scented baits and top waters work well also.  Oh nice bass.
