Do I need to invest into different lure set ups or will the Lakers hit the same salmon spoons I use on Lake O.  If there are any laker guru's on the board, I would sure appreciate info on types of lures and presentations to pick up for the outing, speed I should target trolling and depths this time of year.  Are lakers even hitting in July/August?  Much appreciated."
489001,LefroyFisherman,2010-07-27 23:46:00,602,I would also like to know if you can down rig for lakers this time of year?

Some drag or bounce their c/balls of the bottom, not something I do or would advise, it can be costly if you get hung up. Go to the north shore around the 14th of Oro, slow, slow trolling."
489089,Cudz,2010-07-28 05:18:00,2652,go with chrome and greens.  Spoons.  Last time I was out we did ok at 90' over 116 but in the past I would go 90' in 90' of water.  Some people use 20' leads off ball but I too use more than 50' leads.  7th line to the 5th works as well.  As does BBP.
