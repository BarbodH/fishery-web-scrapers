488789,DanD,2010-07-27 12:46:00,2223,"With the few different threads that have been posted about smokers & BBQ’s I thought I’d show you mine. It’s made out of an old oil tank, a ½ horse electric motor, a gear reduction box and too keep things in tune with fishing & boating; the spit rod is made from a stainless steel prop shaft from an inboard boat. Redneck all the way. LOL Last weekend's pork dressed out at 120lbs when we picked it up at the abattoir and there was still room on the spit to hang a larger pig. It went on the heat around 7;30am and it came off at about 5pm; I went through approx ½ a face cord of apple wood for the coals and smoke; plus 50lbs of lump coal to keep the heat stable. Let it sit on a cooling table for an hour or so and it was belly up to the table for approx. 70 of our guests. All I could see were people smiling, nodding and them licking their fingers. If you ever get a chance to go too a pig roast, don’t pass it up; you’ll never taste better pork then one done whole on a slow cooking wood fueled spit. Couldn’t keep up cutting the meat and crackling for them and there was three of us carving. These are the only pic’s I have so far; got them from my son’s phone; I was to busy cooking to take any. Yea that’s me in the red shirt.  Dan.      "

488801,Fish Farmer,2010-07-27 13:37:00,2234,"Man"" that looks good. Your right on tasting great. I was at a pig roast done the same way years ago, couldn't get enough. But your machine looks top notch."
488807,Grimace,2010-07-27 13:44:00,2020,That's excellent.  You just can't beat it.
488808,DanD,2010-07-27 13:44:00,2223, No I just do it for fun; I hold one most every summer for family & friends. Everybody pitches in with the work and we make it a get together or maybe better said an excuse for all of us to see each other. Why we need one not sure but this one works.  Dan.
488811,I'mHooked,2010-07-27 13:50:00,525,I think I need to go grill a pork chop for breakfast now!  I bet the aroma had people salivating all afternoon!

488820,Rattletrap2,2010-07-27 14:15:00,1652,"That looks great! Is that the ""RED/GREEN"" Signature Series model?  Just a question, how long does it take to get rid of the old oil smell and such from the tank?"
488825,DanD,2010-07-27 14:23:00,2223, ONE BIG   FIRE! After we split the drum in two; we had the thing glowing.  Uncle Red was the inspiration. LOL  Dan
488839,wkrp,2010-07-27 15:32:00,656,Awesome smoker . You are the king of smoke.
488841,Terry,2010-07-27 15:35:00,14456,NOW YOU'VE GONE AND DONE IT   I now have to find someone having a pig roast and get some
488847,alexcba,2010-07-27 15:49:00,634,we do this at my cousins house once every few weeks. one of my fav things about summer!
488849,DanD,2010-07-27 15:51:00,2223, Not sure about the king of smoke but maybe the king of soot. I ran into the “Big House” (the trailer park’s washrooms) to take a shower; while the pig was on the cooling table. I don’t think I’ve ever seen so much black water running off of me in my life. LOL Sorry no pictures.  Dan.
488850,asdve23rveavwa,2010-07-27 15:53:00,2690,"MMMMMM...all I hear in my head is Hank Jr...I cooked a pig in the ground, got some beer on ice...ALL MY ROWDY FRIENDS ARE COMING OVER TONIGHT!!!!!!!"
