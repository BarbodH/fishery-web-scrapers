Recently my manual start 20hp 2 stroke has been giving me some ignition grief. Simply put, no spark. I took it in last summer and was told that the stator plate needed to be replaced. So I replaced it $$$! It ran fine till one trip this spring. Now it won't start. I've been procrastinating and now feel that it must be fixed. Id like to know if there's a way to diagnose the source of the problem. I think it comes down to moisture/ wear and tear. Its possible that the stator is toast again. But it could also be the coils or the control box. How can I tell? I know there is a way to test every component of the ignition system using a multi meter. But I don't know where to begin. Thanks for any suggestions. And big thanks if you point out an easy fix"
