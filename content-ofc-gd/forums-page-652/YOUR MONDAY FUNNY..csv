One of the bags was ripped and every once in a while a $20 note fell out onto the footpath.  Noticing this, a  policeman stopped her, and said, ""Madam, there are $20 bills falling out of that bag.""  ""Oh really? Darn it!"" said the little old lady. ""I'd better go back and see if I can find them. Thanks for telling me officer.""  Well, now, not so fast,"" said the cop.  "" Where did you get all that money?  You didn't steal it, did you?""  ""Oh, no, no"", said the old lady. ""You see, my back yard is right next to the football stadium car park.  On game days, a lot of fans come and pee through a knot hole in the fence, right into my flower garden.  It used to really tick me off.  Kills the flowers, you know. Then I thought, 'Why not make the best of it? '  So, now, on game days, I stand behind the fence by the knot hole, real quiet, with my hedge clippers.  Every time some guy sticks his thing through my fence, I surprise him, grab hold of it and say, 'O.K., buddy!  Give me $20, or off it comes.'  ""Well, that seems only fair,"" said the cop, laughing. ""OK. Good luck! Oh, by the way, what's in the other bag?""  ""Well, you know"", said the little old lady, ""not everybody pays.""    "
