488824,walleyejack,2010-07-27 14:20:00,358,"I have a Magellan that i bought 4 yrs ago, wouldn t do it again,i have a Garmin I purchased 3 years ago, is awesome, probably a little more money than the Magellan, but in my mind it was worth it, if you want a Magellan I have one."

488834,Fisherman,2010-07-27 15:12:00,7201,"I've heard of a number of poeple that have had problems with Magellan products, keypads going bad and not covered by warranty or just plain bad service from Magellan.  I would go with Garmin or Lowrance."
488838,Terry,2010-07-27 15:27:00,14456,I agree with the other guys
488854,Rattletrap2,2010-07-27 15:58:00,1652,"Yep, another one in favour of Garmin here!"
488858,Fish Farmer,2010-07-27 16:14:00,2234,I can't complain about my Magellan Meridian had it for years ice & soft water fishing I've dropped it I don't know how many times and still going. Knock on wood. Maybe I'm just lucky.
489002,spincast,2010-07-27 23:48:00,3279,"bought a magellan explorist 500 on ebay this spring. It was a discontinued model but brand new $90 plus shipping or therabouts,  including shipping. Magellan topo map from the website - $ 45 download to my lap top as often as I want - likewise install on the hand held. So far - so good. I got EC10, bluff's bar, LPB launch point all marked and it got me to each of them just fine so far (but dont ask vinnimon and frankie65 about that one trip back to Jordon Harbour....... track ghost - good thing it wasn't foggy  . Still don't know if that was user or.... just one of those things)"
