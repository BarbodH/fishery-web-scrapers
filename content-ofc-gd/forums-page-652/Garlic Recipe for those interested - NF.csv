488345,Leecher,2010-07-26 00:58:00,7832,You guys remember this pic    It's been drying for the last 3 weeks and today was the day.... I keep my garlic in the freezer all year round and here is how I do it.  Started to separate the bulbs from the heads and this is the longest part about this recipe.  Separating is easy but removing the skin from it is a bit of a challenge..... sticky as hell after a while    I managed to clean half the crop (had 30 heads to clean) and ask my wife and daughter to help me while I was processing them in the food processor  Here's my half    Results after processing    Once it was all chopped finely.... added olive oil extra virgin to the mix.  I don't have the exact measurement but you want to obtain a good consistency similar to a mush.... add a little bit at a time.  In this batch used 1/3 of the bottle.  Here's the results.... you can see the oil in the mix    Once finish mixing.... pour into ice cube trays like in the next pic    Put in the freezer for 24 hours.  The next day run the under side under warm water so that the content detach from it and wrap each cubes into all purpose food packaging film.  Then into a zip lock bag freezer type and back into the freezer.  Garlic will keep for over a year this way and you won't need to chop them when you want to use in a recipe  Now the smell of garlic is all over the house but I'm not complaining    I kept the largest 6 heads for planting next fall.  I placed them into a paper bag and into the cupboard.  Leechman

488353,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-07-26 01:17:00,0,I thought this was a recipe for fish scent. I heard garlic works great! Mush it into a liquid and spray your bait with it! Never it tried it myself though.

488575,motion,2010-07-26 17:53:00,403,"Hey Jacques, there nothing that tastes better than a freshly filleted fish cooked in butter and garlic. I can smell the garlic from here! Great work.  Cheers."

488741,GBW,2010-07-27 03:27:00,8460,If you ever figure out how to make the spray like the YUM stuff Jacques I have to know!  I love that spray for soft plastics!  For some reason it's green
488760,Dusky,2010-07-27 04:34:00,310,Good stuff! nice way to keep the garlic over the year.
488859,davis,2010-07-27 16:20:00,128,"my god i love garlic! good stuff. i've got a whole lot of basil that would go well with that...  if you're not concerned about keeping the garlic clove whole, getting the skin off is as easy as giving them a quick smash with the side of your knife - skin should pop right off."
