488398,gino,2010-07-26 03:54:00,400,Hello everyone! I moved this year from KW to Essex county because of my job. I've been fishing here and there ...but I don't know the area to good and I realized that if you don't have a boat is hard to find some good spots. If anybody is from area i could use some help with some fishing locations. Thanks.

There are several channels to fish for Largemouth and panfish in those channels, just be careful of private property.  Many fish from shore right at the Lighthouse as well.  In the fall, this area gets very busy with Muskie fishermen both in boats and near the Lighthouse on shore.  There are also shore fishing opportunities for perch etc. in the Leamington and Wheatley areas, you just have to search them out.  Canoes can be rented at Point Pelee Provincial park and there can be some good Bass fishing in the marsh cuts at that location.  Good luck  Cheers  Craig"
