We fished from 8pm to 2am  Having never fished at night before with the exception of twice for walleye about 6 years ago, I had no idea what to expect and didnt bother to pre-fish for a small fun tournament.  It was a random draw tournament and I got drawn with my dad which was cool.  I decided to spend my hour and a half of light fishing for a big largemouth bite in the heavy cover.  That didnt pan out for us. So we went to fish a bunch of feeding flats that I like in the late afternoon and early evenings.  We managed 6 bites all night and landed 5 of them.  We got 2 fish on jitterbugs    and 3 on straight black senkos.  We weighed 13 pounds and placed 2nd.  1st place had just over 16lbs and they said they caught all of them in a 20 minute span in one location the size of their boat on black tubes.  I had a lot of fun and I really hope to do it again, heck maybe I'll head out tonight!  "

488536,motion,2010-07-26 16:23:00,403,Great stuff Steve. Was more amazing is that you showed up (on time!) for the Jr. tournament on Sunday morning on just a couple of hours sleep! Thanks again for helping them out by volunteering your time.  Cheers!

Just my feeling on it? on some lakes with a lot of boat traffic I think they move off of some areas when the boat traffic starts and don`t really get comfortable feeding on those spots until after the boat traffic has died down."
488701,Leecher,2010-07-27 01:51:00,7832,Congrats to the both of you on your 2nd place finish Steve Jitterbug is one of my favorites for top water..... I also like using a hoola Popper in black when it's pitch dark. Leechman
