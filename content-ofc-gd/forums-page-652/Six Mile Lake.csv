488581,jbailey,2010-07-26 18:13:00,866,Just heading up to Six Mile Lake for the first time and was wondering if anyone has positive or negative info to share!  Jb
488586,ohhenrygsr,2010-07-26 18:22:00,947,Awesome lake bring a GPS if you can
488651,bigugli,2010-07-26 21:08:00,6138,Even after 1 week you cannot adequately cover the lake. just take your time.
488668,NAW,2010-07-26 22:11:00,4022,"Meps spinner baits.  Change your speed up if your not getting bits.  Look for weed beds, there's lots of them."
488677,livinisfishin,2010-07-26 22:57:00,661,"I launch my boat at the provincial park ramp , funny thing is I've caught all of my fish in that little area . Pike, bass, perch. Crappie in the winter but that's a different area.  Forgot to mention I always do well with 1 1/2"" chartreuse. Twister tails!  Good luck!"
488685,Syn,2010-07-26 23:33:00,519,I'll be pike trolling and exploring the East side of the lake (East and North of Echo Rock) on Thur or Fri depending on the weather. Looks like the temp will cool down considerably after the Wed thunderstorm. I'll report back if I catch anything worth mentioning.
