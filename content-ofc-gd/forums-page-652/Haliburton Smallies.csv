Smallmouth were relating to boulders and rock, and at the primary break to deeper water.  Soft plastics such as tubes and stick baits were producing as were topwater lures like Skitter Pops and Pop R's.  Here were the best two fish a 18"" and a 20""er.  Sorry about the photo quality but I was solo and using my phone.  "

489355,fishboy,2010-07-28 21:12:00,550," I think you can rent from most resorts in the area.  You can likely find places on Kashag, 12 Mile (Wedgewood Marina) and I think Hawk Lake marina rents as well. 705-489-2429.  The best bet might be to call Minden Live Bait 705-286-4826"
