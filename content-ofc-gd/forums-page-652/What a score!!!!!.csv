Then just as I was about to leave he told me to wait a moment and he disapeared and when he came back, he had a piece of smoked walleye for me to try.  WHAT A TREAT! It was the best smoked walleye I have ever tasted. Then, just when I thought things couldn't get any better, he handed me a filet to bring home. Thank you so much Geoff for the wonderful conversation and that beautiful piece of smoked fish (some of which didn't make it home LOL).  Talk to you soon my friend!"

488955,GBW,2010-07-27 21:02:00,8460,"Thanks Cliff.  I enjoyed our chat very much too, thanks again.  As for the smoked walleye, not a problem at all.  I'm glad to hear you liked it.  Take care. Oh, I sent that email too"
488963,Michael_Brown,2010-07-27 21:14:00,411,Smoked walleye to Big Cliff?  Nice one.  Did you tell him that the GPS coordinates of a great walleye spot on Sturgeon were stamped into the fillet after he finished?

489058,GBW,2010-07-28 02:14:00,8460,"For those that want to know, here is how I do most fish.  I get a 450 or 500ML bottle of soy sauce and put it in a large pot. Add 1L of water 100ML of Honey 4 table spoons of VH brand ""sweet chili Thai"" either a had full of hot pepper rings or 2 small jalapeno peppers (cut to rings) Let simmer but not boil. Cool and then put fish in a container with enough brine to cover and the rest goes into a spray bottle. Let fish sit in the brine for 24 hours in the fridge. heat smoker and get the smoke going and add fish at 200* to 225* The wood chips I soak for 12 to 24 hours too and when I do fish it's 1/2 apple and 1/2 black cherry. I get them at Walmart for a decent price but this new smoker I need to use chunks but have a work around for now... with my propane smoker I'm done in 2 to 3.5 hrs depending on the thickness of the meat. I open the door from time to time to make sure the smoke is going good and when I do this I give the fish a little squirt/spray/mist of the brine I made so the meat is moist and has a lot of ALL flavors used. Good luck! Cheers. Geoff"
