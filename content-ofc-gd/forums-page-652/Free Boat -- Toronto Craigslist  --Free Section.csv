489147,g_clot,2010-07-28 13:14:00,104,Thanks - I just emailed them (hope it's still available).  I'll be near there tomorrow night.  Hopefully it fits on the roof of my Yukon XL okay.
489152,g_clot,2010-07-28 13:22:00,104,"response:  ""No, it does not have a trailer.  It also needs to be towed away by another boat.  Our property is on a cliff, so there's no way to get it onto a truck from here.  It's heavy.  Let me know if you have the means to take it.""  Sounds tough - but where there's a will there's a way."
