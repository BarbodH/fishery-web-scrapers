488860,rylan,2010-07-27 16:32:00,134,"I wanted to ask if anyone ever catches Walleye at night on top water.  if so, what do you use?"
488877,Beans,2010-07-27 17:48:00,3339, It was a long time ago as I don't fish at night anymore...but I have caught pickerel on a jitterbug after dark in the Otonabee while fishing for bass...not many mind ya...
488882,alexcba,2010-07-27 17:56:00,634,i've had them smack jointed raps when they broke the surface right infront of me at night..
488915,Spiel,2010-07-27 19:47:00,9065,"I've never used top water for night time walleye but I have had great success using 3.5"" and 5"" Bomber Long A's. A slow and steady retrieve over rock shoals or weed beds was key. Colour was not important."
488937,Jer,2010-07-27 20:33:00,1426,"I fish a popper pretty well every evening when the conditions allow. In 14 years since I moved here, I've caught two walleye doing this. One was just this year."
488950,BassMan11,2010-07-27 20:52:00,583,i caught 2 about 10 years ago in back to back casts on a zara spook puppy in about 2 feet of water between 2 islands.
488978,OhioFisherman,2010-07-27 22:09:00,6623,"Caught them on a lot of different lures, but never top water. I have seen them busting bait fish on the surface, so it is possible."
488991,Fisherpete,2010-07-27 22:53:00,1814,"I have caught a few on a jitterbug, a few on a rapala skitter pop, and a few on floating rapalas that were just sitting on the surface right beside the boat. But as others have said, it is a pretty rare occurence... slow reeled minnow type baits (jointed rap, x-rap) have been my best night-time walleye lures by far."
489032,Paully,2010-07-28 01:19:00,712,got one a few years ago in a jitterbug.. good luck
489038,Fishnwire,2010-07-28 01:29:00,983,"I've caught a hand full of walleye (including one about 4 pounds) on topwater baits, but I was always targeting smallies at the time.  As others have said, you'll eventually get a couple on top-water baits, but your night-time hours are probably better spent using other techniques.  My buddy on the French River goes out during the August full moon every year to a certain spot where all they do is troll Rapala type baits and all they catch is walleye in the ten pound range.  In the days before rubber nets and LED headlights he used to bring three or four mesh-type nets every night because trying to extract three trebles from one of those old nets in the dark was near impossible.  He'd cut the line, throw the tangled net in the front of the boat and worry about it in the daylight."
