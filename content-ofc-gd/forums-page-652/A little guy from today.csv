But I did luck into this little guy.A warrior amongst his peirs!With the same bait! Ive been sticking with one type of bait,and truely indeed the bite has been harder to acheive indeed!As one ofner mentioned previously! Ive tried rattlin spots,texas rigs,gulp alives as well.Only one bait and color produces fish so far!For the hungry bigger fish! Chartruese and white willow blade spinner bait!Brown and green is a hit or miss! Anyway,this is what I got for my hundreds of casts!It was a joy to release him for another fight one day!The scenery was awesome as well!     "
