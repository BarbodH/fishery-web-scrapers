488172,Spiel,2010-07-25 12:47:00,9065,"BRIGHTON, Ont. – The body of a drowned kayaker has been pulled from the waters of Lake Ontario.  Northumberland OPP said that three Brighton, Ont., men were kayaking in Presqu’ile Bay around midnight Friday when one of the men fell into the water and didn't resurface.  An extensive search was conducted in the area where the 29-year-old fell into the lake.  OPP canines, a helicopter from Canadian Forces Base Trenton, locals with boats and police divers were involved in the search effort, which ended Saturday morning when the body was spotted, recovered and transported to the coroner.  None of men were wearing lifejackets when the kayaks tipped, police said.  Police have not said if alcohol was a factor in the drowning.  An autopsy is scheduled for Sunday.  http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/07/24/14816956.html"

488790,blaque,2010-07-27 12:48:00,2419,We can all look back at things we may have done differently and decisions we've made that afterwards made us scratch our head. I dont think that calling out stupidity at the time of someones death is necassarily called for.  I feel for the victim and the ones sitting somewhere grieving for their child/dad/brother
488796,Fish Farmer,2010-07-27 13:17:00,2234, Well said Blague I'm sure that we all have done something stupid growing up. I still look back and consider myself lucky at things I've done. Still hurts when you lose a loved one. My condolences go out the the family
