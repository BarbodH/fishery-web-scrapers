523785,aplumma,2010-11-29 23:30:00,6896,  I hear he didn't because the pencil was to short....   Art

523790,AzuluSpookd,2010-11-29 23:55:00,348,"Too funny, eh? That was my bud up the road, he left his recycling bin for me to fill up, but didn't tell me about that....I had quite the laugh when I got there and saw it.  The neighbour was very funny tonight....I saw him walking the tree line in ""stealth"" mode....he must have forgot he was wearing bright orange, lol....he plopped his arse down 20yards from the pile, right in the bush....staring at the decoy for about 15 minutes, than got up and left....I was laughin' so hard....he was just waiting for him to come trottin' over to him...lol  :whistling:  "
523792,irishfield,2010-11-29 23:58:00,26272,Well it is a realistic decoy.. I took a picture of it this morning in the mist/fog... But when it didn't move for 1/2 an hour... lol
523801,AzuluSpookd,2010-11-30 00:26:00,348,"This is the guy I had at 20 yards, down in the swamp....He was around me for about 45 minutes...cute little fella  His left is about 8 inches, but his right is only a nub....very unique...has a relatively big body though....let him go....waitin' for calf sized  monster that Wayne took a pic of!!  Wayne, when I'm there again, I'll give you a hand doin' whatever it is you need a hand with...I just don't do dishes  "
523803,irishfield,2010-11-30 00:30:00,26272,Hey.. I know that spot! .. You should blur your backgrounds !!

523809,irishfield,2010-11-30 00:43:00,26272,"Is that a ""lucky"" strike?"
523811,AzuluSpookd,2010-11-30 00:46:00,348,I've even edited to see other hunter...he's hard to spot...
523830,Twocoda,2010-11-30 01:36:00,4130, Even funnier again if it was done with HIS pen and someone elses hand writing
