523712,Roy,2010-11-29 19:00:00,13728,We've just received a note from the website hosts saying that it was definitely a hardware failure and that all should be stable now.
523714,skeeter,2010-11-29 19:09:00,1907,roy: does this mean i have to pick up all the pieces of my hard drive now cause it wasnt just my comp?
523822,mercman,2010-11-30 01:20:00,7054,  Skeets step away from the computer....put the screwdriver away.
523828,Bernie,2010-11-30 01:28:00,3190,Seems to be flying along now. Thanks!
523531,Terry,2010-11-28 22:20:00,14456,at least for me it is incredibly incredibly slow loading in  anyone else  every other site seems fine
523534,Dondorfish,2010-11-28 22:26:00,1000,  SLOW!!! - takes 6 or 8 tries to even get on!   Don
523536,splashhopper,2010-11-28 22:32:00,2931,i am having the same issue
523539,misfish,2010-11-28 22:41:00,29133,"Crazy. I was reading a thread,then puff,no connection.  This is not good for the best Ontario fishing/outdoors/hunting site."
523540,Spiel,2010-11-28 22:43:00,9065,I'm only finding it slow when it's actually working.....
523541,Terry,2010-11-28 22:44:00,14456,and that's why I thought it would be good to let them know  10-4
523542,Spiel,2010-11-28 22:56:00,9065," I just checked with Roy, via e-mail and he has let them know Terry."
523543,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-28 22:56:00,10439,Been super slow since it blew up earlier this week.
523544,Bernie,2010-11-28 22:59:00,3190,"  Very good point Chris. Last night I gave up trying, just painfully slow today, as it has been for quite a while"
523546,Cast-Away,2010-11-28 23:02:00,790,I forgot what dial-up was like!
523547,GBW,2010-11-28 23:03:00,8460,it pooped the bed on me 90% of the time I tried to get on today...
523548,Billy Bob,2010-11-28 23:05:00,5865,"I have been getting this almost 50% of the time when trying to post...  ""Oops! Google Chrome could not connect to www.ofncommunity.com""  It's to a point where I'm spending time elsewhere.  Bob"
523549,misfish,2010-11-28 23:10:00,29133,"I feal like the rabbit in the hat. Sometimes he comes out,other times he dosent. Ok this is three times in the last 7 minutes I got booted out."
523563,Dave Bailey,2010-11-29 00:02:00,1641,Maybe the hamster needs feeding.
523565,Terry,2010-11-29 00:27:00,14456,"I think the sites servers have cabin fever  <embed width=""600"" height=""361"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowFullscreen=""true"" allowNetworking=""all"" wmode=""transparent"" src=""http://static.photobucket.com/player.swf"" flashvars=""file=http%3A%2F%2Fvid25.photobucket.com%2Falbums%2Fc52%2FMrbeee1954%2Fofnfever.mp4"">"
523570,SlowPoke,2010-11-29 01:35:00,2984,This is what happens when you move to a tiller server.
523574,ehg,2010-11-29 01:49:00,2666,Kinda frustrating just browsing here now.
523578,Fisherman,2010-11-29 02:49:00,7201,Looks like it's time to play solitaire....
523579,danc,2010-11-29 03:02:00,4677,"Not to worry. If this keeps up much longer, we will give everyone a full (or partial) refund."
523580,fishnsled,2010-11-29 03:12:00,3520," Yep, definitely should have gotten the console.    I'll put my refund back into the pot Dan;)"
523604,crappieperchhunter,2010-11-29 04:42:00,2582,I never realized just how much time I was spending on here until the last week happened.
523613,bigugli,2010-11-29 11:51:00,6138,I was too tired to get frustrated last night. After the second poop-out I crashed.
523700,Spiel,2010-11-29 18:40:00,9065,
523701,misfish,2010-11-29 18:43:00,29133,"pm,s working?"
523702,vinnimon,2010-11-29 18:45:00,2593,Everythings fine so far! The only time Im having issues is if Im playing mafia wars! Then go to OFC! Then things go for the carper!
