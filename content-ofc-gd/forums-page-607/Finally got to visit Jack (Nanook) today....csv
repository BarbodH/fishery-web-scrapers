He and Jackie are tickled pink to be home and teddy (the puppy) appreciates it also...Jack was sitting up in his big chair this morning but was propped up in the hospital bed they have for him this afternoon...It is opposite the sliding glass doors in the middle of their living room so he sees the outside...Jackie has their Christmas tree up and decorated already and a few other decorations around so the room is very bright and cheery...Jack was in good spirits and I was amazed how much use he has of his left hand already...""Gotta get it in shape to reel in a carp"" he said...  He hasn't started physical therapy for his legs yet...the therapist lady was coming next Tuesday but Jackie has to have Jack at the hospital in P'boro for his check-up that day...He can't walk on his own at present so Jackie has to assist him...  One of his wood carving pals dropped by with some books and patterns for wood burning so that is his next project I guess...  After two hours Jack was getting tired so Maribeth and I said our good-byes til next time...  Keep the good thoughts and prayers coming folks...his recovery will need them along with our good wishes and e-mails...he can't answer them himself yet but Jackie can for him...  [emailÂ protected]"
