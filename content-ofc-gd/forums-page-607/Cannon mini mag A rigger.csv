523716,vinnimon,2010-11-29 19:11:00,2593,"I found 3 in north bay and grimsby bait is looking as well! OUCH!!!!!! with NB prices for 2 I can buy a new electric rigger! On the one I have,I think the main gear is worn, the other the motor, windings are going for the carper!"
523796,HTHM,2010-11-30 00:11:00,4082,"take the motors into duke electric on Barton, they might be able to rewind them."
523798,irishfield,2010-11-30 00:15:00,26272,"If it still runs.. it's not the windings.. brushes maybe. Rebuilder would be where I would go first. I get my aircraft starters refurbished for under $80, just down the road, with brand new bendixs and solenoids. New they are $489 !"
523799,HTHM,2010-11-30 00:20:00,4082,"Durn ingineers, always makin us handy guys look like idjits.... Thanks for the tip,  Wayne, handy having an electrical engineer at our disposal  Today was not a waste, I learned something."
523800,irishfield,2010-11-30 00:23:00,26272,They're definitely a brushed motor Albert.. bein low volt DC and all ! Probably a real cheap repair... and you had Vince pointed in the right direction for sure.  As for Bay Distributors.. they are Canon's repair facility and they've been great to me.. of course I got all mine repaired under warrantee for free...
523833,NANUK,2010-11-30 01:50:00,797,"Cannon has a lifetime warranty on the motor, I would be calling their service center, I have had good experience with Mike's Reel Repair in BC (One of Cannon service center)"
523968,John,2010-11-30 16:53:00,2956,"As Stonefish says they have lifetime motor warranty because they are usually bulletproof and rarely have an issue. I am guessing that you are not getting power (sufficient power) to the motor and need to bypass the switch and circuitary to test each motor. Try taking getting power to the motor directly and if the rpm increases you have a switch or circuitary problem. If this doesn't work, I have a very good contact at Cannon who is very helpful. Before you spend money on motors that may be OK try the direct power and see what happens first. If not let me know and I will hook you up."
