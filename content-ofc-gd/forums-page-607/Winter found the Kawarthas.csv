523221,lew,2010-11-27 13:17:00,12766,"Opened the curtains this morning to the 1st real snowfall of the season around here. We've been lucky so far as it seems there's nasty weather all around us, specially over in the snowbelt.  Oh well, I put the snow tires on the truck yesterday and I've got a brand new snow blower just waiting to go, but I guess we need a bit more snow than what we got last night for that.  "

523338,Beans,2010-11-27 21:25:00,3339,27 November 2010     01 December 2009     Pretty close time wise but it got cold right after the snowfall last year and it stayed with us all winter...  They are calling for mild weather on Tuesday so I won't be using the snow blower yet...  Guess I better throw some logs in the back of the truck for traction...
523524,Garry2Rs,2010-11-28 22:02:00,1425,"Winter has settled in for me too...It was down to a chilly 50F this morning.    The white dot in the sky is a Blimp over the Yuma Proving Grounds, where Gen.Patton trained his Tank crews for North Africa and Normandy.  Someone told me the Blimp watches for Illegal Aliens crossing the desert, but I don't know for sure."
