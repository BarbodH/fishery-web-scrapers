523494,superdad,2010-11-28 17:15:00,353,Best of Luck in his retirement - now he can fish without pressure to produce a fishing show - There is a difference fishing for fun and having to catch fish.  BTW - His son is writing articles - saw one in Great Lakes Angler an issue or so ago.
523498,GBW,2010-11-28 18:48:00,8460,"I sent him and email yesterday, here is the reply.  "

523512,mukluk,2010-11-28 19:50:00,196,"Sure will miss Chronzy's fishing show. His campfire rants tell it like it is in most cases. On those really cold non-fishing Sat. and Sundays; I could always turn on the tv set and go fishing with him. ""Is this paradice or what""  Wish Chronzy all the best on his retirement and hope he still stays in the fishing limelight. We need guys like him."
523551,Joey,2010-11-28 23:11:00,9122,"I caught a bit of his show Saturday morn and he was talking about fish conservation and pro fishermen and he said something to the effect ""All you fishermen who dress up like Nascar drivers........   That gave me a good laugh"
523559,Gerritt,2010-11-28 23:44:00,6129,"Wish I could have been there and shared fried Muskie with him. I like Cronzy, always have.. he is a tell it like it is fella, which I appreciate. I would have sat down and had Muskie shore lunch with him anytime.  G"
523616,bushart,2010-11-29 12:00:00,2628,Man how could anyone eat a Muskie-------they're only good for the garden
523623,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-29 12:35:00,0,"I found the show ok. Most of the time he was using live bait, and you didn't learn too much about fishing technique. But you would learn about everything else when it comes to fishing. Especially cooking fish.lol Cronzy is a very opinionated guy and can ruffle a few feathers but he usually knows what he is talking about. Reminds me of a OFC board member.  If I have anything bad to say about Cronzy is sometime times he talks down to his guests on the show, and the way he treated his son some times annoyed me. But regardless, I'm sure his son loves having Cronzy as a dad.  I'm sure we haven't heard the last of Cronzy. You cant keep a guy like that down!"
523633,Stern Rules,2010-11-29 13:50:00,342,I just caught that episode yesterday but Pete Bowman told me Saturday at the OCS that he retired. Can't believe it. Gonna miss the guy.
523635,Rod Caster,2010-11-29 13:59:00,5784,Cronzy taught me that fish have no calories.  I liked the show and watched it whenever I could. Somebody in this thread said it earlier...at least he has the spine to speak up about things. ..and Don Cherry IS a good comparison.  Best wishes Darryl!
523646,John,2010-11-29 14:33:00,2956,"Not a big TV guy, but Cronzy had one of the few shows that I could watch start to finish without all the hootin' and hollerin' that drives me crazy.  Good luck and best wishes Darryl!"
523648,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-29 14:42:00,2690," I met him years ago, at a seminar in Kitchener, Roy.  Always outspoken, controversial, and yes did work hard to get to where he is at.  Somebody needs to keep our MNR on their toes, and, he has done so for many years.  Also was one of the pioneers of the CFIP (community fisheries involvement program) and led the charge to try to ban gill nets in the province. As for Josh, it is great seeing him follow in his dad's footsteps (although, a totally different style, lol). I mentioned on another forum, never underestimate what Darryl has done for our fishery here in Ontario."
523667,bigbuck,2010-11-29 15:30:00,2449,"Well, that's the end of an era of the little guy taking on the government on tv. Cronzy was outspoken and he unllike most other people who complain from their couch had the testees to actually take on the government with dumb policy decisions. He'd go fishing and keep a few for the pan, what is wrong with that???? He didn't break any rules. Have all of you had a nice 'Sweet 16' from a northern lake fried on an open fire on a beach?? It's a great experience and he pandered not to our friends south of the border BUT TO US!! So, hop in your car next summer, go up north, stay at a lodge for a few days for your holiday and catch some tasty 'eyes (that's what I want to do)!!! Good luck and good health to you Big Guy, I will miss your show."
523674,torco,2010-11-29 16:04:00,656,I definitely didn't always agree with him but he spoke his mind and cared about the fishery and anglers in this province and I appreciate that about him. Will miss watching his show from time to time.
523682,perchslayer666,2010-11-29 16:48:00,280,"I always liked Chronzy's show, and his shore lunches, always made me appreciate fishing for what it is, what is can be, and for enjoying the bounty of your catch. A real Canadian show, old school in nature which was always an invigorating show for my self.  Hopefully the new breed of fishing show hosts will incorporate more ""Chonzyisms"" into their shows."
523887,Rich,2010-11-30 12:24:00,3927,"His views on the outdoors are old-school mentalities and thank GOD he doesn't always get his way with the MNR or C&R would be illegal!  Out with the old, in with the new. He had his time."
523233,fisherman7,2010-11-27 14:16:00,325,I had Going Fishing this morning on in the background while I was reading the paper and did I hear correctly that Darryl is retiring? He said something about this would be the last time you see him on TV.
523237,Roy,2010-11-27 14:34:00,13728,Maybe he knows something about your TV that you don't.
523238,Terry,2010-11-27 14:38:00,14456, LOL
523240,Blue Lk,2010-11-27 14:45:00,337,What will he do with all his free time now?Fish?
523249,Guest gbfisher,2010-11-27 15:15:00,0,  probably eat more fish...
523255,canadadude,2010-11-27 15:22:00,769,"Forced retirment......I think maybe his opinions, right or wrong, are not going over well with sponsors or networks."
523259,spinnerbaitking,2010-11-27 15:27:00,1622,"Haven't watched the show for years, won't miss it Richard"
523261,Terry,2010-11-27 15:31:00,14456,"yeah he is packing it in  I think no one wanted to give him a BBQ this year so he said ""I'm out of here"""
523263,skeeter,2010-11-27 15:46:00,1907,"maybe he has been offered the position of ""head of ministry"" for the hunting and fishing!!!!!!!!!!!!!! "
523266,SlowPoke,2010-11-27 15:55:00,2984,"I almost wet myself with that one!  I doubt his opinions are forcing retirement; he may be retiring so he can say what's really on his mind! He's a very polarizing figure and love him or hate him, he's done a lot for our pasttime and I wish him good health and happiness in his retirement. I suspect this won't be the last we hear from him."
523268,BUSTER,2010-11-27 16:01:00,1336,true dat
523273,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-27 16:18:00,10439,"Yeah, I caught the end of his show as well and heard that. Too bad it wasn't Italo retiring!!!!!"
523290,Fish Farmer,2010-11-27 17:35:00,2234,"I'm with Slowpoke. The man did a lot for our sport, I hope he enjoys his retirement. He wasn't scared to speak his mind. I did watch the show this morning and was shocked to hear him say this will be the last you see me on TV."
523303,ch312,2010-11-27 18:56:00,1590,"well that sucks.  its not very often you have a host that isn't scared to ruffle a few feathers by being outspoken and honest. unfortunately, canada is full of spineless cowards who care more about making friends and money than speaking up, telling the truth, and making changes."
523316,Roy,2010-11-27 20:07:00,13728,"Y'now, I've never met the man. I'm sure that he's worked hard to get to be where he's at. It burns me to know that his son is on our board and reads (sometimes accidentally) negative comments about his Dad. Just sayin'...."
523324,lunkerbasshunter,2010-11-27 20:38:00,2585,like him or hate him at least he tells it like he sees it.  He doesn't play it for the sponsors like many other shows.  Good luck to him in his retirement if it is true.  Cheers!
523345,walleyejack,2010-11-27 22:01:00,358,"Yes he was ok, spoke his mind and am sure got into hot water a few times,was informative,had some good fireside chats,keeping in mind he had health issues last year or the year before,can t remember,that may have something to do with his retirement.Just my opinion,I think a few times he was half bombed out there,a little extra entertainment. Wish him good health and happy retirement ."
523453,alexmedic,2010-11-28 11:50:00,186,I've noticed that WFN no longer has him on.  Is he just not as popular as he used to be?
523454,bushart,2010-11-28 12:32:00,2628,I remember when he had his magazine-----put me on some local bass fishin at the time in the Saugeen River---caught lots and was fun canoe'n  It was good for a city kid to get specific info---went 2x---hardly hurt that fishery---hear it still good---maybe better.  Good Luck Darryl----Get to fish for fun now.
523455,fishdawg,2010-11-28 12:42:00,912,"right on Fish Farmer  im pretty sick & tires of all the couch potatoes bashing him and all the shore lunch cracks  i'll say it again, he's the ""don Cherry"" of ontario fishing,and love'em or hate'em  he has contributed a lot to this sport that we love"
523456,pikehunter,2010-11-28 12:46:00,1659,"Agree with Slowpoke. I wish him good health and a happy retirement....whatever retirement means to a guy that fishes for a living  He should take up politics, he's outspoken enough to put all the pointed headed idiots who hold office in their place!"
523459,Grimace,2010-11-28 13:10:00,2020,"Healthy and happy retirement to the Chronz.  A good egg.  I do not always agree with him but most times I do.  The Don Cherry of fishing.  My favourite quote was when he said ""If you do not take your kids fishing I hope when your 80 years old they run your wheelchair off the dock and into the lake.""    I laughed for about a half an hour over that one."
523460,Roy,2010-11-28 13:15:00,13728, *puts that one away for future use*
523462,Musky or Specks,2010-11-28 13:37:00,2710,"He took a lot of flack  but the ""where to"" articles and his Steelheading in Ontario book were great learning tools for a young man just starting out on his quest for exploring the fishing available in this province. Now I would freak if someone gave a hole by hole rundown on a river but it was great when you were a rookie."
523466,fisherman7,2010-11-28 13:54:00,325,I wonder if it didn't have something to do with his health issues?
