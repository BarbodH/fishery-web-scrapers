I am sitting in a restaurant in a small town with no tackle shop for miles that will be open. So, I was going throug a pastic bag of stuff I bought at the outdoors show in Walkerton last spring. I found some small floater jigs.  I am going to try them on a 2-3 flourocarbon leader with some slinky weights to try bottom bouncing first. Then, when my legs need a rest, I will add some weight and still fish this set up. Has anyone used these jigs before? If so, any suggestions as to working them is appreciated. Thanks. Splashhopper"

I rigged up a floater and was picking one up every 5-10 minutes....they thought it was a fluke. After 6-7 fish they both asked me for a floater. I still always keep a pack in my kit."

Although, I always think about sticking myself and injecting worm guts into my finger.....blech.  Probably should just clip the sharp point off, it would still be fine for worms.  I have only used floating jigs for walleye.   Not very often though."
