523374,Cudz,2010-11-27 23:29:00,2652,Managed to get out one last time before putting the boat away for the winter.  I was joined by Jigger who made the northern trek despite the nasty forecast. We got out there and got soaked by big chop coming over the bow.  THe wind was ridiculous and blowing the wrong direction.  We tried drop shotting with slammers but we were moving so fast it was hard to keep contact with our bait.  Finally decided to drag some new strikezone swimbaits curtosy of Mark Kulik and we actually managed 3 on the new baits.  I had the trolling motor on the whole time just to try and slow us down a bit and it ran out of juice after being on for 4 hours straight.  Bad day out on the lake always beats a good day at work.  Thank God for survival suits!!!  Here is what we were dealing with  First bass in swimbait (still in mouth)   Jigger with nice  Another clean fish 
523378,misfish,2010-11-27 23:49:00,29133,Nice clean fish . Lots of boats out in that area this week.
523383,Cudz,2010-11-28 00:07:00,2652,"Lol.  Not on this day.  There was only 1 boat out there and it was us.  Lots of those arctic loons still around.  We figured it was the loonies hanging out with the loons. PS sorry about the blurry pics, my camera is not good at all"
