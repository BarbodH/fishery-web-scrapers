""Nice beaver"" ""Thanks, I just had it stuffed yesterday"" ""Have you ever been to a turkish prison Billy?"" May he rest in peace, with a smile on his face combined with a look of complete confusion. HH"

523755,Muskieman,2010-11-29 21:07:00,2472,"“You're excited? You should feel my nipples!”  ---------------------------------------- Your dog sure has a surprised look on his face. That's because you're looking at his butt. Uh, then he's certainly not going to enjoy that treat I just fed to him. -------------------------------------------- You'd better tell the captain we've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital. A hospital? What is it? It's a big building with patients, but that's not important right now.  ------------------- The life of everyone on board depends upon just one thing: finding someone back there who can not only fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.  ---------- Leslie will be missed by many but will continue to make us laugh for years to come.
