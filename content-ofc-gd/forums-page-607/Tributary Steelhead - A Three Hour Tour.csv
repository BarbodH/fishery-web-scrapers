523831,Aaron Shirley,2010-11-30 01:36:00,655,"I got out this morning for a few hours to make some drifts on a Lake Ontario tributary. The water was just starting to clear from the rain and was still a bit murky, but very fishable with at least a foot of vis. It was a chilly morning out there, and I broke skim ice wading to some spots, but very peaceful. I ended up landing one and losing 2, all on large chart bags. Not bad for a quick fish, and not a person to be seen      Good fishing!  Aaron"
