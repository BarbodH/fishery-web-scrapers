523177,chris.brock,2010-11-27 02:17:00,4053,"I've had a GPS for 10 years but today we decided to try geocacheing We downloaded a cache, it was in a place where we normally walk the dog, it wasn't like the GPS lead us right to the spot, it was more like we kind of got close and had to snoop around, my wife found a plastic box in a dead fall tree, inside there was some cheap dollar store stuff and a book to sign, we signed it and put everything back, it was pretty cool anybody else have similar experiences?"
523178,BillM,2010-11-27 02:20:00,17367,I geocache for back lakes then get rewarded with pike and giant walters
523181,danc,2010-11-27 02:23:00,4677,I had a few finds a couple of years ago. It's fun. Gets you out of the house at least.
523185,chris.brock,2010-11-27 02:28:00,4053,giant walter?
523186,danc,2010-11-27 02:34:00,4677, AKA Walleye. I can guarantee you that Bill didn't find his biggest Brook Trout this way.   Or his biggest Pike.
523189,chris.brock,2010-11-27 02:43:00,4053,"that's cool, we call ""giant walters"" giant pics, the only fish we might find near this cache are probably some creek chubs in the overflow drainage"
523193,BillM,2010-11-27 03:16:00,17367," I got those waypoints marked and tucked away inside my security box, lol."
523212,Stern Rules,2010-11-27 07:22:00,342,I've been caching for a few years now. Most GPS's are accurate to within like 3m so it's not exact but also depends on if the person logged it accurately. They're usually fairly close. Some caches are better than others but it's fun to explore a new area. I like it.
523470,ctranter,2010-11-28 14:29:00,543,"I've found many cache's in Toronto.  I enjoy it because it's an easy way for my girlfriend and I to ""enjoy the outdoors"" without doing anything too hardcore.  It's also great if you have kids, they love the idea of a real life treasure hunt.  I recommend the cache's on the Toronto Islands.  They are easy to find, but if you want to find all of them it is a great walk.  Also there is a good string of them in Christie Pitts, I tihnk an OFNer planted them too.  TFTC!"
523572,ehg,2010-11-29 01:42:00,2666,"I planted some in the Christie Pits/Annex  area here in Toronto. Initially really got into it and found 150 of them in downtown Toronto area, have done little searching recently as my young daughter is losing interest. Was good fun for family getting out to new interesting places."
