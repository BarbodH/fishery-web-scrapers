522929,ripsomelips,2010-11-26 05:12:00,51,"HI All,  I'm looking for a nice, warm hut that will last me quite sometime. Looking for something durable and not too heavy since we're going to pull it out with other gear. Went to Basspro to check out the clam thermal base camp and the fabric is pretty nice and durable but it comes with the price tag of $330 plus tax. For full specs, check it out at	http://www.clamcorp.com/Shelters/PopUpCabin/BaseCampThermal/tabid/391/Default.aspx  Would anyone recommend this hut or are there better ones? Any suggestions would be great.  Thanks for reading, J.Fisher"

I just purchased a 3 Man Frabill Excursion from BP it weighs around 100lb so you have to be in shape to pull it but they say its meant for guys on foot...   Good Luck!"
523115,Sharkbait22,2010-11-26 22:37:00,297,"I have one and enjoy it.  I find fishing for long periods in -10 with wind tough, this shelter helps a lot which means I get out much more and comfortably. Once set up I'm not likely to move every hour. Now I have a Skandic sled and will likely move around more. It takes 10 minutes to setup, drill, anchor and start fishing. The thicker thermal fabric flaps less in the wind than the tine stuff - less condensation too. Strategically setting the shelter to split the wind and using the guide ropes helps stabilize.  Be careful not to bend the ice screws. I wasn't too please with the construction.  They could be made better.  The zippers could be a lot stronger - you must be careful.  The material will stretch in time and closing the zippers will be easier. I have a Buddy heater which heats it well. Good for the family - particully ladies (tinkle tinkle)."

523491,Rob,2010-11-28 16:27:00,467,  My buddy just bought one of these and it is very easy and quick to set up. The material is very good and the price including delivery is awesome.   Rob C
523576,Governator,2010-11-29 02:44:00,879,I just picked up the regular base camp model today (not thermal) from bass pro.  Xmas gift for myself lol.  I was originally looking at the frabill refuge or clam 2000 but after testing them out I was just sold on a pop up.
