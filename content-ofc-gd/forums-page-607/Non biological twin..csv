I couldn't remember catching this fish ... I showed it to all my family and lifelong friends just a few realized it wasn't me... I put this up as my ""facebook"" profile picture... I've had tons of compliments on ""my"" catch... I've always fessed up and NEVER claimed that I caught it.  Whaddaya think?  Me   Not me.   Me   Not me  Me   Me  Randy "

523309,mercman,2010-11-27 19:20:00,7054,"Randy, You're a far better looking specimen than your look a like IMHO anyway"
523335,crossover,2010-11-27 21:04:00,172,"because wearing a baseball cap, sunglasses, and sporting a goatee makes you a rare specimen"
523351,Nipfisher,2010-11-27 22:18:00,2449,"Randy, You should hire a P.I. to track him down. Send him to work for you so you can google images all day."
