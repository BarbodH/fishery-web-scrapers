521847,spincast,2010-11-20 23:44:00,3279,"Nice fish - No doubt about about it - Lloyd knows the waters... our charter with him this summer -  2 hours into the charter  he sayin' OK you got to let me know if its a keeper or release before we boat them, so we don't go over our limits - only a few of each left for us."

522172,fishhunter,2010-11-22 03:10:00,604,This was such a great day with weather. Water was calm and the fish had wide open mouths all day long. It was nice to see Orange Peel team out on his boat relaxing and cooking some fish for lunch. Hope you get your big motor working and look forward to seeing you guys next year.
