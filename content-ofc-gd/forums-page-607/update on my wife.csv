Now waiting for the appointment as to when???Hoping they are wrong because she does not have any of the symptoms that are associated with this cancer???/

523611,pikehunter,2010-11-29 11:28:00,1659,"All the best to your wife. Hope that they are wrong too. My wife went through a scare a couple of years ago, went through bunch of tests at the cancer clnic and had several follow up visits and found out that the Doc's assumption was wrong,(had me pretty worried for awhile) it does happen. If she is going to Juravinski Cancer Centre she is in good hands."
523618,lew,2010-11-29 12:12:00,12766,Best wishes to your wife Kelvin and hopefully they don't keep her waiting too long before they figure things out.

524079,Spiel,2010-11-30 23:36:00,9065, I too am hoping they're wrong Kelvin. Thanks for keeping us up to speed.
524084,GBW,2010-11-30 23:45:00,8460,so much on my plate as of late I missed this.  I hope they are WRONG and it was a bad scan/test.  I know what the waiting time is like and it SUCKS not knowing!  I'm not the praying kind but I'm sending best wishes your way.
