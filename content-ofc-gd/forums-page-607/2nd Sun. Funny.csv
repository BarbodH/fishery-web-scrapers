Be very sure you get this brand.   When you get home, lock your doors, draw the curtains and disconnect the phone  so you will not be disturbed. Change into very comfortable clothing and sit in your favorite chair. Open the package and remove the thermometer. Now, carefully place it on a table or a surface so that it will not become chipped or broken.  Now the fun part begins.  Take out the literature from the box and read it carefully. You will notice that in small print there is a statement:  ""Every Rectal Thermometer made by Johnson & Johnson is personally tested and then sanitized.""  Now, close your eyes and repeat out loud five times,' I am so glad I do not work in the thermometer quality control department at Johnson & Johnson.'  HAVE A NICE DAY; AND REMEMBER, THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE WITH A JOB THAT IS MORE OF A PAIN IN THE ASS THAN YOURS!  ...Remember, if you haven't got a smile on your face and laughter in your heart... Then you are just an old sour fart; Maybe you should go and work for Johnson and Johnson"
