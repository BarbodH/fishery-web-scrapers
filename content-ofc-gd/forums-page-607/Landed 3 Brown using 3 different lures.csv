Worked hard the whole day casting non stop.  Got all three Brown weighing average 5-6 lb  Lure used - a silver minnow 1 oz spoon, a Red devil 1oz spoon, and a Red/black rattler.  I was fishing by myself, and no one to take pictures with me on it,I wanted to speed up everything, so I did not even bother taking the fish out of the net. All fish were release.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/redspoon.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0002-2.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0004-1.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/withspoon.jpg  the 3 lures I had used http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/3lures.jpg  Found inside the stomach of the one of the fish that it regurgitated , 4-5"" minnows. He was greedy, still hungry for more that  got him in trouble . http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/minnow.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/closeup.jpg"
