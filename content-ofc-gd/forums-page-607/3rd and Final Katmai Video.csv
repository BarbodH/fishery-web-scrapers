523878,irishfield,2010-11-30 06:04:00,26272,Neat video Brandon!!!! I gotta ask.. are any of you carrying a firearm or bear banger at least???
523892,lunkerbasshunter,2010-11-30 12:42:00,2585,what is more crazy???  Getting that close to grizzly bears or driving from windsor ontraio to alaska?  Great vid!  Cheers!
523898,skeeter,2010-11-30 12:54:00,1907,"GREAT VIDEO!!!!!!  BUT:: is it just me or did anyone else notice that when the bear came calling and they packed up and moved, that they left the oldest guy trailing behind???  good game plan"
523956,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-30 15:53:00,10439,  As far as I know no firearms allowed in the McNeil River Wildlife Sanctuary.
523957,brandon,2010-11-30 16:10:00,857,"Drifter is correct about the no firearms however we were at the Brooks River, not McNeil.  And we had bear spray with us.  The problem with the bear bangers is that if you shoot it towards a bear and it goes off behind the bear, it may scare the bear in your direction!....but we had no close calls with the bears"
523986,DRIFTER_016,2010-11-30 18:06:00,10439," Same park, different river.   Didn't draw a permit huh?"
523999,brandon,2010-11-30 18:58:00,857,Nah I didn't draw one because I didn't apply for one.  I wanted to go to Brooks in the fall...notice how there were no other photographers in any of those videos other than the 4 others in my group...it was pretty nice to have the entire Brooks River to ourselves
