I might do a bit of steelheading before the new year but I’m pretty much done and the boat is going away.  I had a fantastic year landing lots of fish, putting clients on many PB’s and my inaugural ice guiding season was a success.  I met a lot of board members and I hope to meet many more in the future.  Let’s start off with the ice fishing season.  I spent a lot of time on the hardwater this season chasing lake trout.  Although we did get lots of whiteys, lakers were the main target.  After lots of tinkering, I designed a jig that helped me put a tremendous number of fish on the ice, although like all baits, some days were better than others.                    I didn’t get a chance to do much steelheading this season which is pretty unfortunate as I’ve taken a liking to it.  Did get out a few times though and managed fish each outing        Pike Season was also pretty short lived for me as we took some vacation time to Cuba and I was working long hours.  I did get out a bunch still and we managed some good fish.        Then bass season arrived.  The season started off with too much boat trouble and that hurt my first few tournament finishes of the season.  We got it fixed up though and the season began.  I had a great season, met lots of people and had some great days on the water.  Won AOY for our club again as well.  Enjoy the pics!   Casey Cup after our motor broke down, we just fished near the launch all day on the trolling motor.                                           Kelli’s PB @ 6lbs13oz              Thanks for reading!"
