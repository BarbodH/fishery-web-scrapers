After much research and visiting various breeders, I have decided to go with a chocolate lab. Below is a picture of my new little guy Toby.  He is a purebred, CKC registered energetic pup. We got him from a breeder (kind of an early Christmas gift from my kids). If he grows to look anything like his dad, he's going to be one handsome looking lab!  I'm looking forward to taking him up north with me to enjoy the water and to keep me company on my week-end fishing trips. I'll try to send some pictures of Toby when I get him out (an in) the water.  Cheers. "
523640,TJQ,2010-11-29 14:16:00,7806,Congrats!!
523644,tb4me,2010-11-29 14:30:00,3295,Awesome! If they could only stay that cute. You will love the new fishin buddie!
523645,bushart,2010-11-29 14:32:00,2628,Good lookin pup
523647,John,2010-11-29 14:41:00,2956,"Very cute pup, congrat's"
523652,motion,2010-11-29 14:51:00,403,"Thanks guys. Ya, they dont stay ""cute"" for long."
523685,kickingfrog,2010-11-29 17:31:00,8333, Ya that cute factor wears pretty thin when he chews that baseboard in the picture.
523686,irishfield,2010-11-29 17:34:00,26272,Just be kind to him when you add his rabbies and licence tag to that collar... electical tape them all together!
523693,motion,2010-11-29 17:52:00,403," Hey Wayne, thatâ€™s the kids idea with the big bone dog tag. Darn thing weighs almost as much as the pup! I will keep that idea in mind once he gets his full vaccination tag."
523696,fishermccann,2010-11-29 18:01:00,655,I was  wondering if Toby for a brown pup is pol. correct. My parents got a black cocker  from the pound called Sambo and just called him Sam so there would be no trouble! Just wondering! Congrats by the way he is a beauty.
523699,motion,2010-11-29 18:39:00,403,"I see where you're coming from, however (for the record) he is named after a Disney character Toby Tyler. I was a kid when the movie came out and it was a favorite of mine. It was either that or the wife's suggestion.........Hershey!!!"
523705,Joey,2010-11-29 18:52:00,9122,"what a cutie, congrats"
523706,fishermccann,2010-11-29 18:55:00,655,"I wanted to call my 3 yr. old Golden Ret. , Anne, but that was a no-no from the wife as that is her moms name, we called her Oakley instead , as in Anne Oakly."
523717,beginner,2010-11-29 19:12:00,542,congratz! cute pup..
523723,irishfield,2010-11-29 19:41:00,26272,  Give thought to how good a dogs hearing is.. tags clanking in their ears isn't kind and many guys also wonder why their dogs are deaf by 10 years old...  The tape is no big deal to unwind if someone finds the dog. Also engrave your phone number on the back of one of his tags!
523774,Bly,2010-11-29 22:28:00,1556,Congrats! Adorable
523891,rbaquial,2010-11-30 12:40:00,968,Cute Pup!! Can't wait to pick mine up in 2 weeks!

523946,motion,2010-11-30 15:23:00,403,Thanks. It was a tough decision for us as well. The Lab is what we ended up choosing for our family.  Cheers!
