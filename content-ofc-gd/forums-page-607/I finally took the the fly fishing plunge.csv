523341,muskymatt,2010-11-27 21:53:00,2608,"I took the plunge and bought some fly gear.  I had talked about it and considered it for quite some time now and seeing as Green Drake here in Ottawa had a pretty good sale on I decided I would take advantage of saving some money and buy now.  My introductory set up into fly fishing consists of  Orvis Clearwater 2 908-4 Tip 9.5 , 9' 8 wt.line 4 pc 3-1/2 oz rod Orvis Size 4 (gold) 72 ET 61 15 reel 2 spare spools Stillwater invis. sub-surface line Mainstream full sink line Wonderline power taper Gen 3 SA tippets Orvis leaders and an Orvis Fly bag.  Oh ....and six flies ...  Now all I have to do is either wait till spring, find a spot with open water in winter or move south  Can't wait to try it out."
523390,shane,2010-11-28 00:38:00,652,Looks good.  Might be a bit light for muskies tho'.
523408,muskymatt,2010-11-28 01:45:00,2608," Yup, actually I will not be targeting muskies on the fly. This equip is for anything else.Some species I will be targeting often are gar pike, salmon-trout, bass and pike.  It's just something I've always wanted to try, who knows maybe it'll all be for sale in 6 months time"
523440,Moosebunk,2010-11-28 05:36:00,3970,Welcome to a whole new world of expense Matt.  Good luck with it.
523461,dannyboy,2010-11-28 13:19:00,367,"Nice kit, join a local fly fishing club it is a great way to get started.  Oh, welcome to the dark side.  Dan"
523495,superdad,2010-11-28 17:18:00,353,Matt  Now you have gotten into another facet of fishing and off course you'll have to amass a vast supply of fly fishing stuff.  Next you'll start tying flies and then the real collecting begins.  Cheers  David  aka  Superdad
523689,cuzza,2010-11-29 17:43:00,467, Welcome  That's a perfect steelhead setup (an egg fly and indicator rig doesn't need any finesse to cast it) - get out there and try it out
523708,torco,2010-11-29 18:57:00,656,"Sounds like a nice set up. Orvis obviously makes a quality product and is a stout enough for the species your targeting.  As a newbie myself, welcome to the dark side or should I say the money side. Definitely hasn't been cheap getting up and running fly fishing but its been fun."
523735,bare foot wader,2010-11-29 20:02:00,1354,"whew, nice plunge...splurged on a solid first setup...if you can, I'd suggest try and exchange your full sink for a type 3 or 4 sinktip, a bit more versatile for your applications IMO  paying for casting lessons/guided trip is a bit pricey but will go a long way and quicken the learning curve...or join a club and get out on as many club trips/clinics as possible   extended season until dec 31 on a bunch of tribs and then year round sections as well, get out now before the spring chaos"
523839,Bear,2010-11-30 02:11:00,106,hard to imagine Matt with a fly set up when we see so many awesome Muskie in his grip  :rolleyes:  Congrats on the setup
523904,cuzza,2010-11-30 13:10:00,467,"You can get Muskie on the fly too - you might need more than an eight weight though!  http://www.thirdyearflyfisher.com/video scroll down to the player and hit play, it's ready to go."
523926,adempsey,2010-11-30 14:14:00,1498,"I am sure it won't be saving you much money in the long run, lol!  I have been avoiding float and fly fishing setups since I know that just means more and more gear for me to buy [i am a gear junky].   I stuck with fly fishing for pike with my spinning rod and a spin bubble.  Of course, as a result, I already started tying flies and I don't even really fly fish.  I really enjoy doing it though.   You won't look at the Christmas decorations in the stores the same after you start tying flies."
