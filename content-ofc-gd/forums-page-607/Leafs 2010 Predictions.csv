510373,bigugli,2010-10-08 16:08:00,6138,Jr A is better hockey than the Leafs these days   This from a die hard Bud fan
510378,Bernie,2010-10-08 16:19:00,3190,"Ha. I noticed the stats went up on the poll after the win last night. Win one game and they make the playoffs. Sorry guys and gals, my optimism has gone to almost zero after years of cheering them on. I refuse to believe or support them anymore until management actually proves they want to win rather than make money."
510381,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-08 16:22:00,2690," Actually Jr A hockey can be better than alot of NHL games.  As another die hard Leafs fan (key word being DIE) was it just me or was this game lacking in the usual Leafs/Hab intensity?  I know it was only the first game of the season, but, it was missing that oomph that the match-up usually provides.  Hopefully the Ottawa game Saturday has some fire to it."
510384,GBW,2010-10-08 16:37:00,8460,"Oh, are they going to use the parade route that's been planed for more then 40 years?  I better get a good seat then..."
510390,Mike Pike,2010-10-08 17:04:00,1332,I predict they'll be on top of the league after one game.
510409,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-08 18:25:00,0,Come on people! The leafs have a MUCH better team then they did the last few years! Especially goaltending! They will EASILY make the playoffs!  Yes Montreal played without 2 key defencemen but I think the Leafs played well.
511269,jedimaster,2010-10-12 16:07:00,3472,If they were to play every game rough and hard checking they will have a good chance at making the play-offs. I would expect this effort to die off around December and kick back in just in time to miss the play offs. I hope this early season success sticks for a while though.
511276,Carp,2010-10-12 16:31:00,1488,"My prediction is that the Leafs make the playoffs and get past the first round, but lose in the second round."
511323,misfish,2010-10-12 19:20:00,29133,"Leafs make the playoffs and get knocked out in the third round.MY VOTE.    One thing that stands out about this team then teams before,thier playing like a team.Not one player is sitting back counting on a few top guys to score.  Watching that Sens game,it was  a total team effort.To bad Niel and Fisher thought they could change things with 2 minutes left.  Oh,what was fisher thinking anyways?  The Pens might be a threat   ,but if the buds play like a team,the buds will prevail."
523710,jedimaster,2010-11-29 18:59:00,3472,Some interesting comments in this thread.  Now that they are solidly in 4th last in the league and under .500
523718,jediangler,2010-11-29 19:23:00,1923,"My prediction on Oct 7th looks good, Leafs will finish between 27 & 30th."
523733,craigdritchie,2010-11-29 19:56:00,1586,"I think mine is looking good too (posted same date).  Then again, I didn't think they would implode till January.  Playoffs? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
523764,Garry2Rs,2010-11-29 21:44:00,1425,"Being a Fan of any Toronto team is like loving a bad women. No matter what they do for you today, you know they will break your heart in the end!"
523765,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-11-29 21:45:00,0,"if the leafs season is a wound, these posts are the lemon juice!  LOL!"
523766,jedimaster,2010-11-29 21:49:00,3472,We will have to bounc this thread a few time this season to keep tabs. :)I too predicted below .500 I just don't think they have it in them. Its not that i dont' watch every damned game in hopes of something better. I was really hoping the goal tending would carry them. I guess they need to score more than 0 goals per game to even have a chance.
523770,Squid,2010-11-29 22:04:00,1656,  JB you are one hell of a leafs fan my friend. You stick to them like fish crisp on a fillet!! Good one you my misdirected friend.
523889,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-30 12:27:00,0, Its not over till the fat lady sings.
523895,asdve23rveavwa,2010-11-30 12:47:00,2690,Maybe we should change the poll to how many games this year will the Leafs score 2 or more goals
510159,jedimaster,2010-10-07 21:12:00,3472,Ok so Here it is the official Leafs 2010 Prediction Poll.  I am saying under 500 and out in the first round if they did make it to the show.  Post a comment with what your prediction is.
510171,bassmaster4,2010-10-07 21:50:00,801,make the playoffs out in the second round
510173,Dutchy,2010-10-07 21:53:00,416,"Under .500, no playoffs........"
510184,craigdritchie,2010-10-07 22:19:00,1586,"They are the Leafs.  As always, they will be unbeatable in November, when it doesn't really matter, then fold up like a cheap tent in the new year, when every point counts. Then right at the end they will come alive, and do everything possible to avoid even getting a good draft pick.  Coaches, forwards, defense, goalies, management - none of it matters. They are the Leafs. They will find a way to blow it.  Again.  Take it to the bank.  Under 500, and watching the playoffs on TV like everyone else."
510196,ADB,2010-10-07 23:06:00,444,"I am a huge Leafs fan...  But, if I had to bet on it, I would say they wouldn't make it.  However, they WILL be in the mix.  They won't finish 15th again, but maybe somewhere between 7-10."
510198,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-07 23:14:00,0,"it pains me to say, but the leafs are better than they were last year, and if healthy, will compete in the east for sure."
510200,Grimace,2010-10-07 23:17:00,2020,40-32-8.  88 points.   Tenth but heading in right direction.
510204,GBW,2010-10-07 23:29:00,8460,"Well, Dion can't even pick up the puck from the 'face-off' so is that a sign of things to come?  LOL"
510208,SBCregal,2010-10-07 23:38:00,688,"yup...sure is, whole season is make/break off the first faceoff"
510209,danbouck,2010-10-07 23:40:00,4380,Good ol Cambridge Winter Hawks boy got the first goal
510211,ctranter,2010-10-07 23:44:00,543,Price has had a stellar start to his 2010-2011 Season.  Did I mention today is opposite day?
510213,ketchenany,2010-10-07 23:45:00,3229,Global warming will have the golf courses opening earlier than usual in 2011.
510223,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-08 00:12:00,0,"Leafs will make the 3rd round of the playoffs. They will get rid of Caberle(for a forward) and Wilson(Especially).  Wilson says he does't want to play a defensive style like the other great leaf coaches. Sorry to break it to you Wilson? But defense wins stanley cups. Unless you have an overwhleming offence which is a defence of its own. But the leafs do not have an overwhelming offence. They need defence. You'd think Wilson would have figured this out after not having made the playoffs in how many years?  We have offence, we have defence and now we need a solid checking line. Shouldn't have gotten rid of Ponikarovsky.  I just missed the first 15 minutes of the first period but this year I will be watching the leafs again after many years. Looking forward to a great season."
510226,ctranter,2010-10-08 00:24:00,543," This team has lots of defensive talent.  Komi is playing his best yet as a leaf, Phaneuf I think is overhyped (especially after that extremely lengthy introduction!), but he is undisputably a talented player, Kaberle, who looks like he finally learned what offensive means, Beauchemin has been playing the body a lot more.  I hope they all have a great season, and I'll agree that Kaberle should go, but not for cheap.  As for the O, so far their top line has outplayed checking lines and top O lines as well.  The problem is, once they go off mistakes start to happen.  I like Freddy Sju, but their checking line lacks a tough, gritty forward, like Maltby."
510235,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-10-08 00:40:00,0,kaberle has been flying tonight.
510238,jediangler,2010-10-08 00:45:00,1923,"Leafs will finish somewhere between 27th & 30th, giving Boston another lottery pick, just like last year."
510244,chris.brock,2010-10-08 01:13:00,4053,"I'm a Leaf fan, but, I'd guess they will almost make the playoffs, I think you have to go to the bottom (and draft well) to get to the top, watch for the Oilers in 3 years, just like Chicago getting Toews and Kane, and Pittsburgh getting Crosby and Malkin, I don't think Kessel was worth what they gave up  3-1 Leafs over Habs right now, go Leafs go!"
510258,jjcanoe,2010-10-08 01:46:00,744,  But Dutchy you're a Pens fan who cheers for the Flyers.......
510265,Dutchy,2010-10-08 02:02:00,416, I cheered for the flyers when they were playing who..........???  :blahblah1:    Tell the whole story JJ.
510348,jedimaster,2010-10-08 14:09:00,3472,"I mean its not like we would expect the leafs to go from 29th to winning the cup. Realistically I would be happy if the leafs were fighting for a play off spot at the end of 82 games. If they get in thats a HUGE leap forward. This is my 2 year expectation. Then I would like to see them be a first round contender for 2 years. Once they are good enough to conend to win a first round anything can happen. In 4 years, Kadri and Schen will hopefully be dominant players."
510351,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-08 14:33:00,3761,Playoffs and Cup champions this season. Mark my words
510352,xkempx,2010-10-08 14:50:00,84,OFF to a good start..........they look Fresh
510355,torco,2010-10-08 15:00:00,656,I see them battling this year for a playoff spot that said they will probably finish around 10th in the conference.
510356,capt bruce,2010-10-08 15:01:00,820,"Are they better than last year ??? Looks like it but we will see tonight Montreal was missing some key guys so will not go by win last night . Play offs still a year away , without any draft picks , maybe longer , long time laf I mean leaf fan ,I was alive to see their last cup , ya Im real old , Still I will watch every game and chear for them , but I feel my heart breaking again , will be fun to compare the results in this poll in march .. Go Leafs GO"
510360,jbailey,2010-10-08 15:18:00,866,anyone see Eberle's goal against calgary!? just woooooooooow
