1014879,Fish frames,2017-10-06 00:52:00,36,Took out. Couple of cameras and headed to a local river to catch the salmon migration. They're pretty beat up this time of year but still a site to see jumping and swimming up the shallows.  
1014886,OhioFisherman,2017-10-06 01:50:00,6623,Do they spawn successfully there? Cool video.
1015362,Fish frames,2017-10-12 19:37:00,36,Successful - i doubt it.  The salmon fishery all over the Great Lakes relies heavily on stocking. Be interesting to hear others opinions.
1015366,John Bacon,2017-10-12 19:58:00,3277,Successful - i doubt it. The salmon fishery all over the Great Lakes relies heavily on stocking. Be interesting to hear others opinions.  Fin clipping studies from about five to ten years ago indicate that there was approximately a 50/50 split between hatchery and wild fish in Lake Ontario.  I don't have stats on individual rivers.  There would be large differences from one river to another.
1015377,BillM,2017-10-12 21:13:00,17367,Lots of natural reproduction in Lake O.   Great vid!
1015382,spincast,2017-10-12 22:28:00,3279,cool vid   .. last years stats from the NY on the Salmon river was a 50/50 ratio still of stocked vs naturals if I remember correctly.
1015383,chessy,2017-10-12 22:54:00,610,everything east of oshawa is 100 percent natrual reproduction
1015548,b_cdot,2017-10-15 13:38:00,270,"I know down here on Lake Erie we caught lots of wild steelhead when in past years you could tell they were stocked. I know this has nothing to do with Lake O. It's quite likely these steelhead spawn in ohio, pennsylvania or new york"
