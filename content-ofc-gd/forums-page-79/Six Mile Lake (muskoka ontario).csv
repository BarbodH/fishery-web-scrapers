726214,NAW,2012-08-30 20:39:00,4022," Next time your going to Six Mile, send me a PM.  I can give you some pointers on the lake..  As long as they stay of the main forum after"
1013858,krr6581,2017-09-21 00:28:00,5,"Well, here I am getting ready to fish Six Mile in a couple of weeks. Though I understand people not wanting to divulge their Honey Holes it seems like some kind of advice on areas of the lake to fish for different species would be helpful. Personally I prefer catching ol' Micropterus Salmoides more commonly called Mr. Largemouth. Call it my Southern Roots (Louisiana) or what have you.  It's been my experience where you catch one you'll also likely  catch a pike or two. I'm not asking for someone's Honey Hole information but I would like to narrow down the areas that tend to hold those big mouth bass. I would appreciate any information anyone would care to share.  Don't get me wrong if I find the smallmouth bite going on that would be fun too but I really like catching Largies. All my fish are catch and release. Ok, I ied...... if I catch a crappie or walleye (pickerel) they're going into the frying pan! Thanks"

1014671,krr6581,2017-10-02 20:57:00,5,Well either folks just ignored my question about Six MIle or nobody reads this forum anymore. I found fish and plenty of them. I went yesterday and found some nice Largies in the grass. found one Island that had a steep rocky bank on one side and lots of grass on the opposite side. On the steep side I found smallies up to 3lbs schooled up in a wolf pack and caught 4 of them. I also connected on a nice walleye there as well. On the grass side of the island I picked up several largemouth again up to 2lbs. There seemed to be largies everywhere I went. I found a drop off at 15 feet and threw a Tennessee Shad colored Fat Free Shad crankbait and caught 3. This is where my biggest fish of the day which was a little over 4 came from. If your willing to look around and take your time looking at your graph (if you have one) you can find a lot of fish.  Though I didn't fish for them I did find a bunch of walleye near another island on an underwater hump. They were laying right on the bottom. I was wishing I had a Lindy rig with leach.  I may have to go back and catch a bunch if they're still there as they fry nicely in my skillet. .  Bottom line is there are plenty of fish in Six Mile so just go and have fun. By the way all fish caught were released alive. Please practice catch and release so the next angler can enjoy having fun.
1014681,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-02 21:37:00,8243,"krr, you must have done some digging to bring up a 6 year old thread. As for the lake you sure hammered them, congrats. People do read this forum, regularly. But usually don't get too worked up over a 6 year old thread.  Why not introduce yourself as a new member? Welcome to OFC by the way.  Art, most of the forums I frequent have a rule that threads 6 months old can't be revisited unless by the OP. I don't know if that is good or a bad thing."
1015883,krr6581,2017-10-18 22:24:00,5,Unfortunately this was the only post I could find on Six Mile. I knew it was an old post but I really needed to figure out some areas that I could fish based on others comments. Looking at my Navionic charts for six mile there was little to no information on the lake and the same for the internet searches.  I went back to Six Mile 4 days later and was almost shut out. I only caught 3 fish on the next trip but one was a 5LB smallie. So not all was bad. There is really some great fishing to be had there but like any other lake or fishing trip situations change and the bite changes too.
585349,danz,2011-05-21 05:03:00,15,"Anyone ever fish here nfor pike? I may have a chance to get out for one day this weekend, never been before.  any tips? are there big pike in there?  also, out of curiosity are there any muskies in the lake? being that close to the Bay and the Pool you gotta figure they are in there no?  "
585418,BillM,2011-05-21 19:15:00,17367,"No muskies in Six Mile, it's a tough lake for pike/bass."
585422,irishfield,2011-05-21 19:41:00,26272,  It is odd... with just that dam in the way!  
585448,bow slayer,2011-05-21 22:47:00,1074,I have personally  seen a few musky that were caught on Six Mile so they are there.When I use to camp there back in the late 80s there was an older dutch gentleman camped beside me that brought one back with him one morning around 15 lbs.Then about 4 years ago I was fishing a shoal close to Pretty  Channel when the other boat near me landed a ski around the 12 lb mark.Yes they were both musky not pike.There is also a few hanging in the park office that were caught on Six Mile.
585463,crossover,2011-05-22 00:25:00,172,"I had a lot of luck on Six mile, but not by the park."
585560,misfish,2011-05-22 15:47:00,29133,Six mile has some great bass fishing. Just have to work to get them.
585865,mattyk,2011-05-23 17:10:00,2110,"There are pike in six mile, just look for the weeds and some deep water near by."
585887,NAW,2011-05-23 18:37:00,4022,"I've seen a few musky caught there too, but few and far between.  One guy showed me a video of him catching a massive musky there from last season.  Very very rare to see a ski on that lake.  The fishing is hit or miss there.  Troll a mepps spinner around weed beds and shoals.  I would be very surprised if you didn't catch a handful of pike.."
585897,bigugli,2011-05-23 19:31:00,6138,"Simple truth about 6Mile is this. There is plenty of good fishing. On weekends there is an excessive amount of highspeed boat traffic, so the fish is a little tougher. The same for many a larger Muskoka lake. Never used to be that way but that's the way it is now. I run up between Tues. and Fri."
586098,Bob,2011-05-24 10:39:00,370,"Nice photo, Wayne. I caught my PB wally just on the downstream side of that dam.  Way before yesterday, believe I was driving a '57 Pontiac at the time."
586118,bigugli,2011-05-24 13:03:00,6138,"We used to slide down White's Falls as kids,  beer in hand   How none of us ever got hurt is beyond me?"
586739,Bob,2011-05-26 03:13:00,370,"Yeah, we got away with a lot of stuff that would be verboten today. I remember getting on a Gray Coach bus with a shotgun in a case to go hunting numerous times and no one gave it a second thought.  Try it today.  There were no safety checks for cars or breathalizers for people or cars then.  My first car cost me $25.00.  No one cared if you had paper for boats and there was no such thing as a fishing license.  Remember the year they sold fishing licenses and then gave everyone their money back because administration costs were too high?  I never claimed my money back and still have the license."
722248,anglin jake,2012-08-13 13:27:00,2,"I went on a camping trip to six mile lake park and did some fishing while I was there.  I was there mid July.  There wasn't a lot of info on fishing the lake on the internet so I thought I would add my 2 cents to the internet world, especially since I will not be going back any time soon.  The fishing wasn't bad but wasn't great.  During the day, I had the most success fishing for bass around islands casting spinners and mid divers like a hot n' tot.  Mainly stuck with black and green.  Midday fishing was tough.  We had the most luck in the same spot, same time, everyday.  I don't remember exactly the time (don't usually have a watch when camping) but maybe around 630 - 7."
722262,NAW,2012-08-13 14:46:00,4022,":wallbash:  :wallbash:  Read the rules man..!  And maybe the ""Intro"" post as well.."
722270,SlowPoke,2012-08-13 16:07:00,2984,Having a rough day? How about trying something like this: Welcome to the board and thanks for your contribution. We look forward to seeing an introduction; tell us a bit about yourself and what you like to fish for.
722286,NAW,2012-08-13 17:12:00,4022," Your right slowpoke..  BUT  I have a cottage on this lake, and it's tough enough fishing as it is.  I don't appreciate people breaking the OFC rules and posting specific ""hot"" spots."
722288,Spiel,2012-08-13 17:17:00,9065, Unfortunately it would seem far too many here have never read the forum rules!
722354,Jer,2012-08-13 21:11:00,1426,"    I'm still looking for where he was specific in any way about any ""hot spot"".  The lake itself is hardly a secret with that big Provincial Park right there and all...    I can imagine the hords converging on the lake as we speak."
722358,BillM,2012-08-13 21:21:00,17367,The multiple bass tournaments ruined that lake a long time ago.
722360,misfish,2012-08-13 21:26:00,29133," Some how,most of his report has been removed. WTH."
722404,kevin booth,2012-08-14 00:37:00,57,"there is lots of pike and bass in six mile,there is also walleye and the odd musky in the lake as well but are very hard to find this time of year.good luck"
722410,woodenboater,2012-08-14 00:45:00,2277,Guess a Mod went in a tidied it up since it doesn't show it was edited. It was pretty specific from what I remember.
722414,BillM,2012-08-14 01:10:00,17367,"I wasn't very specific, the guy mentioned a single spot in a giant lake, lol..."
722469,NAW,2012-08-14 11:43:00,4022,"Whether the lake is big or small, it' still breaking the OFC rules.  It was specific details, about a specific spot on the lake.  I actually fish this exact location several times a year.  A mod went in and removed the specific details on the location, which I appreciate very much."
726179,anglin jake,2012-08-30 18:13:00,2,"  I apologize for breaking the rules.  When going to a new lake, I can usually find some information/tips on the internet.  Six Mile was extremely tough to find anything on.  I thought I would help out people in the same position as me who just want to catch fish.  I didn't think anything of it at the time but can see how people would be upset.  I am also not certain if it was the spot or if they just start biting in the evening and I just happened to be in the same spot, same time everyday since I was on my way back to the park."
