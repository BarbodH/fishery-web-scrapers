Started to drizzle on the way to my local, but that's ok, it,s not like I am made of sugar.  Arrive well before day light ( I don't like to be late and always want to be first ) So sat and waited on my favorite log by the river and enjoyed a cigar and my java. When I was able to see my float, I started drifting. This morning I was getting away from my awesome sweet/salty cured roe and going fresh. Reading something that MJL posted, I tried it. Well it didn't take long to get fish banked.  Think I might of pissed a couple of guys off that were chucking hardware, as I would hit fish right in front of them. Well not right in front of them, that would be rude, but out from them where they were chucking. LOL  Im sure John F was beside me and  LHAO as I hooked up with that MOJO rod.    Stopped in at my old friends place on the way home to offer him a fresh feed. I will never forget his smile when I offer him a fish.  I like shinny things,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  "

I only know what time the Sun comes up if I either am just coming home from the Casino's (down to once a month) or I can't sleep, usually the latter. You keep it up Sir. For me there was nothing better than to hit the water at daybreak, from shore out front here from the beach or in the boat, a hot coffee in one hand and a rod in the other. The quiet still water, the Sun peeking up over the east tree line, the cooing and the soft chirp of waking birds, the sudden breaking the silence by the odd dog barking in the distance wakening his pal to take him for a walk. Everything all to yourself. It feels like you are the only person in the World at that time of day."
1015624,PUMP KNOWS,2017-10-16 02:12:00,937,Sweet catches!  I started going all fresh last year and it produces.  I'll only cure if a batch of my eggs start getting funky and I'll pautzke brine them.

Nothing like just sitting there in quietness A branch snaps, is a deer coming to the waters edge? A hoot from an owl, a screech from a Blue Heron. A splash on the water. Is that a fish, a duck a beaver. The mind wanders and I get intrigued,  I could go on, but many think Im crazy already. So I,ll stop there. LOL     Sweet catches!  I started going all fresh last year and it produces.  I'll only cure if a batch of my eggs start getting funky and I'll pautzke brine them.  My sweet and salty is not going anywhere. It has it,s purpose one the colder water comes.    :clapping:  :clapping:  :worthy:  Thanks   Awesome pair of bows   Thanks dude.   Nice fishes and cool story to boot! Thanks for sharing.  Thanks Dusky  The MOJO rod, will be with me til the end.    Another fine post there Mr B *wishing I lived closer your way*   You got places close to you G. Only thing is, I wouldn't be eating them. LOL Me bad.  Great C&R tribes though."
