1016009,b_cdot,2017-10-21 00:39:00,270,Curious what transducer needs to be installed on lowrance hds 5 to be compatible with the built in terrova transducer. Been using generic 83/200 just wondering if this is optimal? Thanks!
1016017,gaspumper,2017-10-21 01:38:00,393,You ever get the transducer cable that broke spliced back together and working?
1016019,b_cdot,2017-10-21 01:55:00,270,Not yet. Will let you know. I have a bud stopping by this weekend with his soldering gear..fingers crossed

1016058,b_cdot,2017-10-21 23:45:00,270,Thats what its on now... just wondering whats optimal
