1014479,chris.brock,2017-09-29 15:34:00,4053," We get up in the air and the young pilot says ""do you have a camera?""  yes  ""does it shoot video?""  yep  ""you might want to get it out and start filming""    "
1014486,npt1,2017-09-29 16:51:00,220,"Nice video, but I would rather hear the noise of the engine and not a twangy guitar in the back ground that drowns out the power sound of the engine."

1014499,Old Ironmaker,2017-09-29 19:24:00,8243,"I have some time in when I was a kid taking flying lessons at Mount Hope.Most of the runways were dead straight, actually all of them where. Those bush Pilots are real Cowboys that know how to. ""Runway? I don't need no stinkin' runway!"" Wowza!  I can hear the Pilot saying to himself ""Scotty we need more power!"""

1014524,Terry,2017-09-29 23:50:00,14456,i thought it is against the law to just fly that close to the ground
1014542,BassMan11,2017-09-30 12:31:00,583,Awesome Chris! I had a flight like that out of Nakina last year. Although we had a very low ceiling and there was a reason for it. Average altitude was 350'.
1014551,lunkerbasshunter,2017-09-30 14:43:00,2585,That was awesome!  Cheers
1014882,chris.brock,2017-10-06 01:14:00,4053,"I'm pretty sure it is. The ceiling was low, but not that low, he was just screwing around.  To be honest I wasn't in the mood for it. I was burnt out and I just wanted to get home to my family. We saw lots of bald and golden eagles up there. I was worried about hitting one or spooking up a bunch of geese or ducks and hitting them."
1015074,Moosebunk,2017-10-09 04:40:00,3970,"Reminded me of a return from Hearst to Moose Factory.  Friend and pilot John flew us nearly the whole stretch low over the Missinaibi and Moose Rivers.  Hell's Gate, ThunderHouse, Moose River Crossing, etc., it was a joy to see those places up close and personal without a week long canoe trip attached."
1015209,can u fish,2017-10-11 01:18:00,326,"Wow that is crazy Chris have been on quite a few fly ins and that would not sit very well with me Flying at that altitude, if i remember correctly on my first ever fly in out of Nakina i had all kinds of questions for the pilot as it was  my first time in a float plane and i was in the the co pilot seat, we had a very low ceiling that morning and i had asked him if we would be flying below the low cloud cover, he said yes we are going to give her a go and he said as long as we are flying no lower than 500 ft all will be good so I am assuming that was the lowest altitude they were allowed to fly.  Cheers Mitch"
1015216,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-11 02:49:00,8243,"Those Bush Pilots don't need no stinking laws either, not all but some are real Cowboys. I don't think the owner of the plane would be too impressed either."
1015554,S.M.05,2017-10-15 14:08:00,145,"You guys smuggling fish in or what? Wild ride for sure.  BTW Don't post here much now but have enjoyed your last few reports Chris, keep them coming."
1015619,chris.brock,2017-10-16 01:04:00,4053,"Thanks Mike, it's good to have you around here."
