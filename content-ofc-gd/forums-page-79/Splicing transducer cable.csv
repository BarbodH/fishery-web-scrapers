1015581,smitty55,2017-10-15 17:35:00,928,"To be fair they are not repairable from a shop. They can be patched by a person though. If they repaired it and charged you only $100.00 you would expect it to preform perfectly for as long as the transducers life and would expect them to repair it for free if water got into the splice and stopped working. Worst would be they repair it and it does notwork %100 as well as it did before. So thats why you got the unrepairable answer. I hit cases in the plumbing profession that I will condemn a faucet and the homeowner decides to fix it himself. after he spends 2 hours and some jb weld he ""fixes"" it. If I did the same thing and gave him a 2 hour labor bill and a maybe it is fixed it would have been the same price for a new faucet. You can find in a plumbing warehouse a well wire splicing kit. The repair of the wire do as others have advised but while the wire is in two use the well wire splice shield it is a shrink tube with a special ooze inside that when heated to shrink makes the splice permanently water proof.  Good Luck   Art Yea, they are called environmental splices. I've used hundreds of them in the aviation industry on engine harnesses. You need a good heat gun with a u-shaped attachment on the end to deflect the heat to the back side of the splice so they shrink evenly for best results.  Cheers"
1015601,ecmilley,2017-10-15 22:17:00,2163,Yes repaired many never an issue I generally use shrink sleeve with the built in sealant to finish the repair
1015603,Woodsman,2017-10-15 22:48:00,1286,Not familar with the type of transducer. Is it a single/dual freq or does it also have sidescan/downimaging with the transducer. If it's one of those transducers with many different freqs I'd take Jos's word for it as not repairable. I've spliced an old single freq transducer but wouldn't expect good results with a multi freq one.
1015607,Terry,2017-10-15 23:15:00,14456,its transmitting a sound frequency not an rf frequency so the impedance of the wire is much less critical and should not be a problem
1015614,b_cdot,2017-10-16 00:07:00,270,I'll keep ppl updated on the process. Let you know if i have success or not.
1015615,b_cdot,2017-10-16 00:08:00,270, Definitely multi freq. 83/200 chirp 455/800. Total scan does it all
1015480,b_cdot,2017-10-14 20:49:00,270,"Big eff up yesterday. Totalscan transducer flew off the back of the boat yesterday. Wires were damaged by the prop but was able to save the transducer. Curious is this is fixable. Called angling outfitters, where i bought it from and i was told i am screwed. Just curious if anyone has had any luck repairing this? Should i even bother?"
1015482,Terry,2017-10-14 21:00:00,14456,i have fixed them before i took the shield wire from a piece of Coaxial cable and put it over  the wires and slide it out of the way solder  wires together and taped each wire then slide shielding over the joined wires making sure it is touching  the old shield wire or foil whatever was there  and tape tightly or shrink wrap
1015483,b_cdot,2017-10-14 21:21:00,270,So i might not be screwed? Why is angling outfitters telling me to toss it out?
1015484,porkpie,2017-10-14 21:21:00,2521,"Bummer!  I hope Terry's suggestion works for you, that's an expensive transducer!"
1015489,Fisherman,2017-10-14 21:58:00,7201,"What Terry said,  patience, small soldering iron, electronic solder, maybe some thin shrink tubes or liquid tape and shield."
1015491,b_cdot,2017-10-14 22:57:00,270, Think it was 350-400$. Cant believe it happened
1015492,b_cdot,2017-10-14 22:58:00,270,
1015493,Fisherman,2017-10-14 23:08:00,7201,"Serves me as a good reminder, I have to add a couple of cable holders to the back of the boat."
1015496,b_cdot,2017-10-14 23:18:00,270,Mine broke... not very effective when going 45mph
1015505,smitty55,2017-10-15 00:30:00,928,"Like Terry said, soldering the wires is easy, most important is to make sure the shields are well connected. I would try overlapping them to ensure good continuity and shrink sleeve real good so they don't move. Even if you have to cut back the outer sleeve some you can always shrink sleeve over that as well. Certainly worth trying as you have nothing to lose. Even if there is a bit of interference noise it could well still be quite functional. Good luck.  Cheers"
1015516,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-15 02:33:00,8243,"I was told not fixable but Terry said yes so I say yes too.  How does a transducer come off? When you remount it use 3M-5200. That is as long as you never want to take it off, that stuff is like welding plastic. 4200 if you want to remove something in the future.  I mounted mine on a piece of that plastic cutting board from Dollarama. 2 bucks."
1015522,b_cdot,2017-10-15 03:46:00,270,My mounting plate is fine. The screws ripped out of the mounting plate that connected the transducer to it. The mounting bracket has a small bend in it. Its quite possible something knocked it off. I cant make sense of it either
1015524,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-15 04:53:00,8243,We soak the screws in 5200 before going into the plate. We use a deep course thread screw.
1015526,b_cdot,2017-10-15 10:21:00,270,Definitely doing that! Is 5200 an epoxy or a glue?
1015541,Fisherman,2017-10-15 12:41:00,7201,"It's a glue and sealant, not epoxy."
1015543,dave524,2017-10-15 13:02:00,4508,"You need to maintain the impedance of the original Coax cable , usually either 50  or 75 Ohms , I would try to splice it with cable TV connectors before just soldering.."

I've got a few electricians at work I might talk to. Maybe they would be nice enough to help me out.
