There is no justification in picking only one solution. Electric cars and trucks doesn't solve global warming. You gotta deal with all of the marbles and each marble will likely require a different solution.  Now you can say then why are we dealing with the red marble because it doesn't solve anything and it costs those who don't have a lot of extra money?

Art  Scientists in the field state the issue is the probable catastrophic and lasting damage to our civilization caused by global warming. The solution is less CO2 in the atmosphere which means a reduction in world wide CO2 production. If the electricity for your electric car is produced by nuclear energy, solar, or wind...there will be a major overall reduction in CO2 pollution that your car will produce compared to a combustion engine. I'd hazard a guess that even electricity produced by natural gas generators for a electric car creates less CO2 then a combustion engine."
1014627,aplumma,2017-10-01 21:15:00,6896,"The level of CO2 in modern vehicles has greatly improved.   Quote Emissions of these air quality pollutants from road vehicles have been reduced by improving the quality of fuels and by setting increasingly stringent emission limits for new vehicles. As an example, it would take 50 new cars to produce the same quantity of air quality pollutant emissions per kilometre as a vehicle made in 1970. Over the last twenty years increasingly stringent emission limits have been set at a European level, starting with the ""Euro1"" limits in 1993. From September 2015 all new cars currently have to meet the Euro 6 standard. Since 1st January 2011 all models sold have had to meet the Euro 5 standard.  End Quote.  Taking this with a grain of salt and even halving the number of 50 claimed it would make more sense to give tax credits or a buy off all of the pre 2011 cars to reach these numbers before going to an alternative fuel vehicle. We already know no one wants a nuclear plant near them or a wind farm for that matter. Solar not yet it is still to cost prohibitive just look at how few solar houses you see in places that have access to the power grid. The area i live in had 1 year emission testing to keep your vehicle on the road they have been monitoring roadway CO2 levels and are finding so few vehicles failing the tests that they have moved to eliminate the emissions requirements. We then have to look at the fact that almost all of the contractors I know need a vehicle that can go over 200 miles a day and haul parts and tools that would tax even the most robust E vehicle. We could then explore the commercial vehicles used to haul products cross country. Think Boat, Railroad, tractor trailer or aircraft no amount of electricity can do there job. The final hurdle is what if you want to go on vacation from your house even as close as cottage country you would have to still have a car that uses some kind of fuel that is portable semi safe and cheap enough to make it possible for you to own and support the extra vehicle. A tax break and or an old vehicle buy back is a realistic way to lower emissions standards while E cars for the working, mass movement population technology is not there yet. It does have a place for the people who work 50 miles or less and commute but to set up the grid for any further is cost prohibitive  but that is not who they are targeting with a pick up.   Quote  In 2016, emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) by the U.S. electric power sector1 were 1,821 million metric tons, or about 35% of the total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions of 5,171 million metric tons.2 CO2 emissions from U.S. electric power sector by source, 2016    End Quote.

Per capita we are right up there with the leading emitters of CO2 but if you look by country China easily eclipses our emissions. When the overall goal is to get every country to significantly reduce CO2 emissions I don't think we can go with the argument that we have lots of trees so we have done our part.  Your quoted facts are for the US, which energy production wise pollutes a lot more than Canada. Worse, Trump is pushing for the creation of more coal plants.  Ontario no longer has coal fired generating plants so our emissions are down significantly... which is a good thing and is a fine example for the rest of the world. If we understand that the possibility of rising global temperatures is a threat to the world as we know it, then China and the rest of the world will have to lower and eventually almost eliminate the dependency on a carbon based economy   (this graph is for Ontario)   It is a valid argument that there are better targets then cars/trucks to reduce emissions ...like coal fired electrical generating plants. Canada has about 15 of them with most of them in the west. Compare that with 500 in the US and about 2000 in China.  To end on a positive note, the world focus on CO2 emissions has drastically cut into the production of new coal plants in India and China. https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/22/coal-power-plants-green-energy-china-india"
