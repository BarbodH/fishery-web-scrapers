1016036,manitoubass2,2017-10-21 14:50:00,11391,"Cool!  Not many around here, I've seen a few though.  One lady has 4 as pets, not even sure if that's legal? Lol"
1016037,huzzsaba,2017-10-21 14:53:00,884,"Cool!  Not many around here, I've seen a few though.   thats cuz they are all in the city!  Honestly, this year I have seen a surge in skunks in urban areas."
1016038,manitoubass2,2017-10-21 14:55:00,11391,"Now skunks on the other hand lol, those things are everywhere"
1016039,limeyangler,2017-10-21 15:06:00,5204,"Now skunks on the other hand lol, those things are everywhere   YUP!  Found this guy 3 days ago while clearing out the sunroom, lucky I never got sprayed. Left the door open for half an hour and he snuck in.    "
1016040,manitoubass2,2017-10-21 15:43:00,11391,I used to think skunks were kinda territorial.  About 30 years ago we had a skunk ripping open garbage nightly so my grandpa had my uncle bring out a pellet gun and a piece flank steak.  I joined just to watch  At dark he put out the steak in a semi lit area and we just sat there. After about 5 minutes we got the skunk!  Until 5 more minutes past lol. You could literally sit out all night shooting skunks.  Their populations must be HUGE
1016043,limeyangler,2017-10-21 16:39:00,5204,"Yeah, that's what the bugger had been doing the whole week, ripping garbage bags open, getting in the catflap"
1016044,GBW,2017-10-21 17:19:00,8460,"I had a big one in my yard last night, it was into the trash next door..."
1016052,ketchenany,2017-10-21 22:17:00,3229,"They must be moving north/northwest. Must be all of the junk food down here, want to eat healthy!"
1016053,manitoubass2,2017-10-21 22:22:00,11391,Lol millennial raccoons!
1016085,Rod Caster,2017-10-22 14:25:00,5784,I shot and ate a racoon the other day. It was rabid good.
1016088,Governator,2017-10-22 14:45:00,879,Raccoons are everywhere in the GTA and everytime I see one I replay the music in my head from the raccoon scenes from the movie The Great Outdoors lol.
1016090,DanD,2017-10-22 15:15:00,2223,"The Coon in your clip Simon may have been rabid? For it to walk up to your truck the way it did, is not normal at all. They're nocturnal and for it to even be out during the day, is in itself suspicious; as to its health. My daughter lives outside of Ilderton; if my son in-law sees a skunk or a coon out during the day, it gets trapped (if possible) or shot and taken into the vet; 90% are found to be rabid.  Dan."
1016100,SirCranksalot,2017-10-22 17:27:00,3291,If you ever run short of coons up there we can send you up a boxcar load or 2!! Free shipping incl!!
1016112,limeyangler,2017-10-22 19:55:00,5204," Exactly why I remained in the truck, one of the symptoms of rabies in animals is when they are unusually docile.  Lol....start a Davey Crocket hat business. Actually that's how they end up this far north, they get on a train, fall asleep or whatever and can't get off ."
1016113,manitoubass2,2017-10-22 20:29:00,11391,Lol reminds me of the 8 billion foxes hanging out at the mine last summer. Left my truck window down and a fox hopped in and tried to snag my lunch lol  Brave lil guys
1016117,limeyangler,2017-10-22 21:40:00,5204,"Too late, we all got rabies.......    "
1016118,manitoubass2,2017-10-22 21:42:00,11391,^^^  Post of the year ?????
1016204,jimmer,2017-10-24 20:05:00,2730,It might have been a released pet.
1016210,DanD,2017-10-24 20:21:00,2223,It might have been a released pet.  You go and check that out!!!!  Here kitty kitty and it turns into coonzilla. LOL  Dan.
1016212,DRIFTER_016,2017-10-24 21:00:00,10439,"Lol reminds me of the 8 billion foxes hanging out at the mine last summer. Left my truck window down and a fox hopped in and tried to snag my lunch lol  Brave lil guys  Had one come up to me while shore fishing here in town. They are super friendly. I was hand feeding him minnows.  I have a den in the hill at the foot of my driveway. There's always foxes around. My dog dislikes foxes for some reason.  No raccoons up here though. We have more menacing critters to deal with. Every year there are bears in town that need to be relocated. We've also had wolves, coyote's, lynx, cougar and I have even seen a wolverine on my street. Got some pretty cute critters about too. Ermine and pine martin as well as these fellas.    "
