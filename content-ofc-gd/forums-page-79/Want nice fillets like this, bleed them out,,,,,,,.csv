1016092,misfish,2017-10-22 15:29:00,29133,"I have been layed up the past 3 days with a wicked cold virus or sumthin. Pumped the body with vitamin C and slept something like 36 hours. Im not one for sitting around and it kills me when I cant get out fishing. Even had to pass up on my last toon outing of the year yesterday . Yes, it is getting put away today.  Woke up this morning and felt good enough to finally eat and drink something. Gave it an hour and said the hell with this, Im not sitting here today. Grabbed a tube of tied roe,rod,back pack and I was off. Even the mrs,s said, I knew you were not going to sit here. LOL It was a great few hours. Not a soul around and I went 4/5. What  a stellar morning.  Go to my back pack and no camera. Oh well.  Anyhoo,  I bleed my fish right after I get them if Im keeping. Cut the right spot and the blood gushes out. When I get home, I end up with fillets like this,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,    "
1016093,manitoubass2,2017-10-22 15:44:00,11391,"Nice work and great looking fillets!  How ya gonna cook em?  Also, glad your feeling better!"
1016094,Mister G,2017-10-22 15:53:00,1429,Looks like you  need to re-bleed them walleye fillets out again.........
1016095,huzzsaba,2017-10-22 16:16:00,884,those look tasty!
1016098,ketchenany,2017-10-22 17:25:00,3229,"I bled for you too. Good shot.  Cigars and slime will do it, give up the cigars, lol. Did you kiss Tarry?"
1016099,SirCranksalot,2017-10-22 17:25:00,3291,I guess you weren't at 'the bend' if you were alone!!
1016102,porkpie,2017-10-22 17:52:00,2521,"I've been snapping necks on my fish for many years.  Better quality meat, and if your keeping some eggs as well you'll get better quality roe."
1016103,misfish,2017-10-22 17:52:00,29133,I guess you weren't at 'the bend' if you were alone!!  OK  LOL
1016104,misfish,2017-10-22 18:00:00,29133,"Nice work and great looking fillets!  How ya gonna cook em?  Also, glad your feeling better!  Just broil and brush with garlic butter with some dill. Simple"
1016105,manitoubass2,2017-10-22 18:06:00,11391,Mmmmmm  Sometimes it's better to keep it simple.
1016107,woodenboater,2017-10-22 18:48:00,2277,"I'd love to take on of those, wrap it in foil with a good helping of unsalted butter, some fresh sage and s&p. mmm"
1016110,Sinker,2017-10-22 19:08:00,8692,"Broil them in a caserole dish in white wine, don't over cook them, it only takes like 5-7 mins.  Then make a dill sauce to put on them.  1/2 plain yogurt 1/2 sour creme dill weed to taste  When the fish is done, just brush a little of that sauce on and bobs your uncle.  So good!!  S."
1016120,PUMP KNOWS,2017-10-23 00:31:00,937,Very nice looking fillets.  Looks like the fillet knife is working just fine.
1016121,SirCranksalot,2017-10-23 00:51:00,3291,Looks like the same Dollarama special I got.
1016155,jimmer,2017-10-23 16:09:00,2730,Do you take the row of bones out of the fillets?  What's the best way to remove them?
1016158,BillM,2017-10-23 16:42:00,17367,"I usually cook steelhead or trout whole.  Meat just comes off, and zero bones."
1016162,Sinker,2017-10-23 18:15:00,8692,I pluck them out with needlenose pliers or forcepts.  S.
1016163,SirCranksalot,2017-10-23 18:16:00,3291,"I steak the upper part and cook with the bones, then just slab the lower part. Cook simply with little 'adulteration'. Skip the lemon---don't need it on fresh fish!"
1016166,misfish,2017-10-23 20:29:00,29133,"I pluck them out with needlenose pliers or forcepts.  S.  On larger fish, I will slide the blade along both sides of the hair bone. Just like I do on white fish. A good knife will do this nicely."
1016280,LittleWorm,2017-10-25 20:40:00,122,"I have seen videos and different people saying to bleed the fish but I myself have never done it. Will have to give it a try,,,,,if I ever catch a fish again that is! It's been a very bad year for me, every time I try to get out i've had wicked headaches . Get them about 5-6 times a week, finally after months and months of waiting I have an MRI set for Nov 27, wooohooo! Maybe they can figure out what wrong with my noggin."
