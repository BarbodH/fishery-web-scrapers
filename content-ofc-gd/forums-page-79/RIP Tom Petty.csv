1014913,Henricus,2017-10-06 13:16:00,118,"Favourite among a library of great music...Breakdown (live) where the crowd literally sings the first minute or two of the song and his response: ""gonna put me out of a job"".  Classic Petty."
1015029,pics,2017-10-08 13:21:00,1268,"Nice tribute on SNL to him as well as the victims who died in in Las Vegas. Jason Aldean, who was onstage during the shooting spree sang won't back down.."
1015036,Sinker,2017-10-08 14:41:00,8692,"Nice tribute, but Aldean has nothing on Tom. Nothing.  S."
1015045,misfish,2017-10-08 18:04:00,29133,"Nice tribute, but Aldean has nothing on Tom. Nothing.  S.   Either do you, but sing and play his songs. LOL  Aldean, rocks the country scene."
1015125,Sinker,2017-10-10 02:28:00,8692,"Im not a great singer or player but i still love to do both.  Im not big on Aldean....or any of the new country stuff really. I like chris stapleton and i do a couple eric church songs, but the rest i call wanna be country.  I dont mind the old country classics, but im more of a rock and roll guy.  S.   "
1015126,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-10 02:48:00,8243,"Jason Aldean is a singer songwriter, he has everything to do with Tom Petty."
1015269,Sinker,2017-10-11 22:11:00,8692,Tom petty is in a whole different league than Aldean. Maybe you missed my point?
1015272,smithy97,2017-10-11 22:21:00,70,"One of the best musicians of all time - 2017 has been a terrible year, we've lost some amazing talent so unexpectedly!"
1015291,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-12 01:11:00,8243,"That all depends if you are a fan of Aldean and don't know who Tom Petty is because you were born in 1999. Tom Petty is Mom and Dad's music to millennials Sinker. I didn't enjoy listening to Glen Miller, Doris Day and Louis Prima but Mom played their records all day long. Alllllllllllllll dayyyyyyyyyyyy long! Thank the Lord for the British invasion or I would have lost it when I was 9."
1015341,Sinker,2017-10-12 15:12:00,8692,Even millenials listen to Tom Petty man!  S.
1015354,Headhunter,2017-10-12 16:46:00,5703,"Tom Petty has sold over 80 million records... probably more since his passing has put his catalogue back up on the Billboard charts. Can't find Aldean's sales, but I would hazard a guess that they are not near the 80 mill + range. HH"
1015357,Sinker,2017-10-12 17:26:00,8692,"Yup, I read an article somewhere the other day saying Tom Petty's sales have increased dramatically since his death.  S."
1015373,bow slayer,2017-10-12 20:27:00,1074,my 2 sons aged 22 and 17 both listen to and love tom petty along with many other classic rock and this was after toms death.....all college students....they seem to know tom as well

Just Saturday we were at the club and this guy came in and he was a Tom Petty clone and we all remarked how uncanny the resemblance. He had a terrible voice that sounded great if that makes any sence.  Sad. condolences to his fans, friends and family."
