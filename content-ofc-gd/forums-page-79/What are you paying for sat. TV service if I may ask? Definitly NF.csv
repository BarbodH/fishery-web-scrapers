1015386,Raf,2017-10-12 23:40:00,3495," you will definately not get HBO.  you would be limited to the networks.  you're on the erie north shore correct?  you will pick up whatever US networks are based out of buffalo and erie, pa.  maybe cleveland?  punch in your co-ordinates here.  http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=90  the cost will depend on how much power you need.  you will likely want/need a decent roof/chimney mount.  as for streaming, i would look around at other options besides xplorenet.  maybe talk to neighbours to see what they are doing.  there may be a local company beaming wireless."
1015387,GBW,2017-10-13 00:13:00,8460,"The only way I see to get what we want, not need, is to wait until one or the other have a deal for switching over or having the current carrier to match the introductory offer.  Another way is to get friends and relatives to go on one bill. I don't know how that works, I know they must know where the dishes are and most homes don't have 6 receivers, or do they? We have 2 for only the 2 of us, so maybe.  We have friends that share the cost 5 ways or more in several remote locations, how does that work? They must know they aren't in the same house. I split up the quote a bit: Point 1, they will most times do the price match stuff. Point 2, Yeah you can have up to 6 receivers on 1 account and you ALL share the bill and the same channel pkg.  The bill goes to one house under one name.  Bell and Shaw have changed to One account for your home and ANOTHER account for the cottage/trailer.  In the past they didn't care if you had 2 properties. Point 3, the receiver cannot tell Bell or Shaw it's location unless it is plugged into an active phone jack.  The phone jack sends the info back to the provider to say you are ordering an on demand or pay per view movie vs calling in to order it.  They get you one way or another if you want the service. We in Canada sure get the short end when it comes to communications! 100% blame the CRTC!  They told all the carriers the new plans and packages and rates.  Trust me I blamed them all the time because it's 100% true the CRTC screws the consumer on TV and cell phone plans.  The home phone and internet plans are what they are."

It looks like we are paying the going rate for what we are getting. If I bundle with phone and internet I could save some money but swore we would never go with Bell internet again after receiving a bill for $1800.00 for a Demon Dialer charging LD rates from Sao Tome Africa getting into our landline about 16 years ago. Long story that was covered by The Hamilton Spectator and CBC news at the time. We weren't the only victims.  The plan is to relocate this coming spring so we will just stay with what we have for now and then reassess after we move.  1100 channels available and nothing on TV. I don't miss the days of having channels 1 through 13, and only 8 or so that was clear enough to watch, or do I?"

1015442,GBW,2017-10-14 00:30:00,8460,"FloatnFly, that happens in a few areas.  The switch (node) cannot take on any more so they use the old lines.  My address in Lindsay was to have Fibe Aug 14 2015 yet I cannot get it today.  They just started to do work this week to find the damage causing the delay.  Oh and I have even seen areas in Brooklin (Winchester and Anderson) that there was NO SAT TV tech for installs on 4 roads in the area.  It is what it is either a switch issue or a tech issue (tech being person or the software used to map areas of availability) that causes the problems...  And that's not just with Bell.  IO, when you do move check the homes on your list as to what you can get at the home from the providers web sites.  Oh and if you do cancel Bell but like it; have the Mrs make the new Bell account for the promo's.  You will not retain a home phone number that way however..."

PS to all.  If you call to cancel a home service contract before it's up (with Bell and the others should offer this too) and you tell them you have to cancel because you are leaving the service area (proof needed to an extent) or moving out of the Country for any reason the contract is null and void as they do not service the area you are moving to.

At the end of our driveway is one of those brown Bell box connections. Only 1 person now is connected to it, it was once 8 cottages, that is until I accidentally run it over with my truck or boat trailer.

I want to throw a foam brick at the TV. I'm really interested in a salad recipe at 7AM. I will watch it, for 15 minutes then go to a news program. I never want to see anyone lose a job but I did cheer under my breath when they gave the boot to that woman of which I won't name who did the features every morning, she had to be on some very expensive Cocaine to be that excited about replacement windows from Home Depot at 6 o'clock on a Monday morning.  I recently listened to someone in the know on a AM talk show talk about the major cost to the TV providers, Bell, Shaw, Rodgers etc. The major cost associated is the Pro. teams with NFL football being number 1, MLB second to the NHL last and below NCAA Football and B Ball. The little old lady next door that doesn't have TSN, Sportsnet etc. is paying 60% or more of her monthly bill towards the cost that the providers pay to the big leagues for television rights. I can't remember exactly how much ABC paid for the rights to televise Monday Night Football. I know it wasn't in the Millions, it was over a Billion USD. That Billion dollars is passed on to every little old lady that pays the $35.00 or whatever it is a month for basic cable."

1015289,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-12 01:00:00,8243,"I don't keep my eye on utilities at home. My wife does the utilities, I always check Hydro and Gas but not TV. I should be in the loop but am not, my head is in the sand so to speak. We have 1 Bell HD and 1 Bell SD box, both our boxes. All the movies except for Super Channel, we have HBO, TSN, all the upper HD channels. Time shifting as well. Today I got involved because the Sat. dish needs to be adjusted. Of course they said that a $75.00 service charge would apply and I told them to transfer me to customer service to cancel the thing after 17 years. 2 minutes latter they wave the charge, no shoot Sherlock. Any way I find we are paying close to $150.00 month and I find out movies are $6.99 each and average 4 month, man that's another 30 bucks plus tax. So lets say $120.00/ month all in. It was $55.00/month when I ordered it in 2000. I did look at going to Shaw when it was available 5 years ago and it was the same as Bell once all the promos expiered, about $95.00/month. It is the only other service I can get I'm told because of location.  We don't have enough bandwidth to go internet only and because of NFL games I wouldn't. Watched a game last year at my Brothers through the Internet and wanted to throw a foam brick through the screen with all the pixilation and tech difficulties.  What are you paying a month for Sat. TV, for what channels and with whom if I may ask?  Thanks ahead of time,  The guy stuck in the 90's and still has a VHS recorder and uses it."

I went with Netflix for movies and stuff, it's $11 a month  That's all HD as well with a pvr.  I've been going back and forth on deciding to go with an android box or not,  my gf parents went with iptv for a month, and it was horrible,  was probably just that the box was the cheapest on the market, but yea, bad"
1015301,GBW,2017-10-12 02:20:00,8460,"Well IO as I'm sure you recall I was a Bell rep till I left there recently.  As for HBO/TMN that's a $25 add on to ANY plan and about $37 if you have the Super Channel too.  As for general TV channels I say look at the channel line up in the Good pkg and then the Better pkg.  Those are the stock line up's. Let's say, the Good pkg + TMN/HBO covers you but the Mrs (or you) MUST have one or two missing channels...  That's fine you can add them to the Good for $4 or $7 per channel.  Still less than going to Better pkg.  You can also add a few ""a la cart"" channels for a flat fee to to the Good pkg BUT TMN/HBO are not in that as they are a premium pkg. Keep in mind TMN/HBO has some free on demand movies/shows but the $6.99 ones are Pay Per View On Demand.  That means not on the current month TMN pkg but if you really must see it you pay for it like you have been. Do you actually use the Time Shifting?  If not there is a cash savings there too. One thing I can say is that they are a true 1080P HD service for Sat TV and well; the other companies are not.  BlueRay vs VHS unless the others have done something new in the past 30 days... Keep in mind this one thing!  If ever calling looking for a loyalty team to cancel (any service carrier) the calmer and cool you are in that call the easier it is for the agent on the other end to be willing to help and the odds are you score a new deal and get what you want and get it done much faster. I was with a cable company for a while when I moved here.  I noted and called often about actual service issues I had.  Well, keeping calm and collected I was refunded $427 for my 'lack of service' when I called to cancel it. Feel free to pm me if you have any other questions about that company OI and what to do.  But really scan the channel line up in both Good and Better pkg's and you can see what I mean.  The ""Select"" pkg is no longer offered after the CRTC made all the new pkg's a year or so ago.  So if you change to a current pkg you cannot go back!!"

We don't watch because like I said it is sad to see these producers use peoples disabilities to sell Toyotas and condoms. I admit my guilty pleasure is 90 Day Fiancé, (please don't tell my wife). She knows and just shakes her head, anyway.......
