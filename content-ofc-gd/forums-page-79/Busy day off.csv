Monday was pickles and hamburger relish and getting some pork belly into a pail of brine. So far today I've been pouring lead for jigs and pencil weights. I'm now stewing down tomatoes for another batch of salsa.  Now you can eat your hearts out. Just finished a morning session with the smoker. 2 sets of honey garlic sausage and 8lbs of apple cured bacon just sitting on the counter cooling down.  Guess I'll reward myself and spend the rest of the afternoon fishing. "

I love my own or anyone's homemade cured port belly, smoked and then sliced into thin beacon strips. Good on you for having the time to do these kind of things. I wish I had more time; or possibly looked for the time?  Dan."
