Boat motor is likely using 80 - 90% of its power most times. We've all likely done this; at the end of a drift, we start the motor; barely let go of the key and we nail the throttle. Running half or better throttle in a chop and the prop comes out of the water. The tachometer pegs its needle; then the next second the prop is back in the water and drags the rpm down just as fast as they went up. In other words we beat the living crap out of boat motors. I'm surprised at how well they handle these beatings. So the harder we treat/beat on engines/motors the more frequent the service intervals.  Dan. I agree with everything you said, however these northern outboards sit more then they are used. I can see 5 years making sense in the south where the outboard can be used year round but up here it's sleeping most of the time."

1015085,captpierre,2017-10-09 15:44:00,2521,Looked in owners manual of my 10 yr old Yammy. Says timing belt should be replaced after 5 yrs. Haven't done it yet. I do my own regular end of season maintenance. Runs perfectly. I guess I should get that done. ??? I did change plugs and impeller at 5 yrs.
1015087,ecmilley,2017-10-09 16:40:00,2163,Yes get it done and pretty simple as far as timing belts go
1015093,Mister G,2017-10-09 19:44:00,1429,I don't know anything about Yammy's but if it's a interference motor and that belt breaks while running you now have a nice heavy anchor because the valves will be driven into the pistons. NOT GOOD....
1015101,16 Footer,2017-10-09 21:29:00,191,Why does your Yammy have a timing belt when a timing chain would last the life of the engine? Like car engines the timing belt is an unnecessary expensive repair when timing chains last the life of the engine.

Like car engines the timing belt is an unnecessary expensive repair when timing chains last the life of the engine.  I bought a used Chevy Chevette years ago, I had it about 8 years and had to replace the timing belt twice. I replaced them myself and thought it was pretty easy compared to replacing a timing chain. You are right though most timing chains never need to be replaced."

Like car engines the timing belt is an unnecessary expensive repair when timing chains last the life of the engine. Because timing belts are more precise then a chain that can stretch. Many fine tuned foreign car engines have belts rather then chains. Lexus has a 4.7L engine that has a timing belt while a Ford Tempo only uses chains.  Five years seems like a short duration for a outboard engine to have to change the timing belt. Most car/truck engines suggest the belt to be changed at about 145000 km.  This could be why Yammies run so much better then those ugly black anchors you always see on cheap boats....LOL

1015134,DanD,2017-10-10 10:49:00,2223,"If a manufacturer is trying to squeeze out as much HP, at the most cost effective way; a timing belt will win out every time. I'm not saying its the best thing to ever happen in engine design; but it works well in so many ways. The biggest thing to the manufacturer is the cost to produce a belt driven cam, rather then a chain driven. The next thing is weight 5-6 lbs of chain, compared to maybe a few ounces of a belt. Right there a belt is free HP; easier to spin something light. The only downfall is the service intervals of a belt.  Dan."

I had a chain go on my 5.6 liter V8 and it required an engine rebuild to the tune of $3500.00, in 88', ouch. Not 20,000 KM later the exact same thing happened so I took it to a Benz dealer and they did the rebuild and put in what they called a ""double"" timing chain. Is there such a thing? No cost to me. As for the first rebuild they said I should have gone to them first. Another expensive life lesson."
