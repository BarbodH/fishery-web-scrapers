Meet a really nice new CO today, saw the truck parked at my gate and then this poor guy walking the 1200 feet to the house so I meet him 1/2 way. He has taken the reins from Wayne Lintack and Rick Williams.  He's absolutely down to earth, looking for law breakers and nobody else. We had a good chat about conservation licences and Musky fishing, local hunters, poachers and many other things.  If you see anything amiss in Simcoe County call him and report it directly. Tell him I gave you the number.  Joseph Fralick 705 796 1699"
1015681,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-16 20:57:00,8243,Out with the old and in with the new. Some of the new CO's are retired Cops I have learned. They seem to take enforcement a bit more serious. That is until they have banged their heads against the stone walls of Queen's Park one too many times and become complacent like most that are on any job too long.
1015684,irishfield,2017-10-16 21:05:00,26272,This lad is about 35 I would say...
1015688,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-16 21:26:00,8243,"Yea that's old enough to retire from the Cop shop. Actually some pack it in after 10 years or so, get some meat on their resume and move to a less hazardous branch of law enforcement, or go into lucrative private security. One kid I know landed a job with a wealthy family for a 6 digit salary including a nice place on the estate, driving kids to school, wife shopping and the patriarch to the airport and meetings. Sometimes accompanying them on the private plane to exotic locals. Nice gig but on call 24/7/365."
1015698,crappieperchhunter,2017-10-16 22:37:00,2582,Nice gig but on call 24/7/365.  That not a nice gig...that's adequately compensated slavery.
1015701,misfish,2017-10-16 22:50:00,29133,Rick Williams  Will not meet a nicer guy in the field.
1015704,irishfield,2017-10-16 22:59:00,26272,.. or at your door Brian!  Not sure if Rick retired or not. Wayne has...
1015710,misfish,2017-10-16 23:07:00,29133,".. or at your door Brian!  Not sure if Rick retired or not. Wayne has...  Have not seen Rick around here for about a year.  Then again, have not seen a CO around here at all.  I do know  where they have been camped out. Snaggers beware.  No Sturgeon in that river."
1015745,tomkat,2017-10-17 13:48:00,246,"That must have been the same guy that I encountered on Georgian Bay years ago, really rude and lectured me about musky and conservation license. I just told him hes missing the point. He kinda put a damper on a beautiful day by getting under my skin. Started going on about convincing a judge I would be in possession if taking a picture blah blah blah. Im pretty safe though since I cant buy a musky in the bay!"
1015783,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-17 21:17:00,8243,"On call, not working 24/7. I take it you have never been in management. You do what ya gotta do."
1015787,crappieperchhunter,2017-10-17 22:08:00,2582,"On call, not working 24/7. I take it you have never been in management. You do what ya gotta do.  Yeah I've been in management. That's a different definition though. That's inadequately compensated slavery"
1015849,Acountdeleted,2017-10-18 16:35:00,2562, Yeah I've been in management. That's a different definition though. That's inadequately compensated slavery    (I'm going to let my Millennial roots show for a second)  Sounds a lot like doing an internship or a placement.
