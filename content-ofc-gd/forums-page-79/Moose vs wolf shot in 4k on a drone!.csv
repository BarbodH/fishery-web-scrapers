1015472,misfish,2017-10-14 18:18:00,29133,Very cool.  Thanks
1015474,manitoubass2,2017-10-14 18:42:00,11391,"Wow! Unreal shots! Thanks for sharing  I've never seen a lone wolf so aggressive, nor a cow so reluctant.  I think that moose is probably Ill or diseased.  Or maybe the wolf, or both?  That was really cool to see on a drone shot"
1015475,can u fish,2017-10-14 18:52:00,326,That is pretty awesome footage it seems like the wolf had spotted the drone and decided to give up his pursuit of the Moose very cool thanks for sharing.  Cheers Mitch
1015476,misfish,2017-10-14 18:55:00,29133,"At the end, you can see there were two. That would explain the lone wolf looking towards the shore all the time. Looking for help."
1015486,woodenboater,2017-10-14 21:31:00,2277,"If moose had gone to deeper waters earlier, canis lupus might have drowned trying for a meal. as it was, water eventually got deep enough the wolf let go, from what i saw."
1015487,manitoubass2,2017-10-14 21:43:00,11391,"Yep, that's why I found it odd it had not gone to deeper water earlier. It kept looking at land(but maybe that was because a 2nd wolf was there like Brian pointed out)  Im certainly no expert but I've seen this twice on small northern backlakes. Once with 3 wolves and once with a bear, and the moose just went full tilt into the water escaping both times no prob.  Again, awesome to see this footy! We don't get to see enough of the north American wild documented!"
1015488,captpierre,2017-10-14 21:45:00,2521,I suspect the moose had already been chased by the wolf. Standing out in the open water. No Lilly pads to eat. Surprised one wolf would take her on. Maybe she hurt other ones and they took off. Must be hungry.
1015517,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-15 02:40:00,8243,It won't load. Man I want to see it.

1015528,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-15 11:21:00,8243,"Thanks Terry, amazing stuff there. A lone Wolf to boot. My wife won't watch it. She thinks meat comes shrinkwrapped on Styrofoam and she grew up on a farm, she reminds me it was a fruit farm. I told her it's a happy ending, for the moose anyway.  Imagine how much money Helicopter services in the TV/Movie industry has lost to cheap drones? Lots.  While we are at it this video was in a window below the wolf/moose clip. Mother nature is amazing and with todays technology we get to have a birds eye view in HD. The only 1 I have to question is the last one where the girl is attacked riding her bike. The narrator sounds like the comedian that was the DJ on Rockabilly Super Sounds of the 70's.in Pulp Fiction I believe. Steven something.  "
1015565,leaf4,2017-10-15 16:08:00,2466,"I think the moose may have been injured from a prior attack maybe? I was surprised at how long the wolf held onto the front leg, if that hind leg was able to get some kicks in I don't think it would feel too good!"
