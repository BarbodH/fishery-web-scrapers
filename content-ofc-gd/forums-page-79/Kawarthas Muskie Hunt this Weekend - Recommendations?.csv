1015813,KraTToR,2017-10-18 11:14:00,506,Wind and weather reports for the entire weekend look favorable so a buddy and I are looking towards the kawarthas.  Any recommendations for lake/pattern?  I've heard that Sturgeon has been hot this year.  Thoughts?  Patrick.
1015886,Hank Jr,2017-10-18 22:38:00,146,"I sent you a PM just got back from a Oct 1 -8  trip we fished Balsam , Pigeon and Sturgeon and you are right Sturgeon was the best Lake for numbers and size . There were 3 different groups of people fishing Sturgeon around that week all did pretty good . If you want some help send me a email ."
1015893,Rizzo,2017-10-18 23:53:00,4754,How about St Clair? I think I bumped into you there a couple years ago. Maybe you are looking for something a bit more scenic?
1015925,jimmer,2017-10-19 16:14:00,2730,"Take Pigeon off your list.  The fall is very tough fishing on that lake.  Not to say you won't hit a good day, but the other prospects are a better bet.  Sturgeon for sure from what I hear."
1015929,Sinker,2017-10-19 17:18:00,8692,"I fish all those lakes, a lot, and honestly, they are all pretty much the same. If conditions are right, you will catch fish in any of them. If I were going musky fishing this weekend, I'd fish the east end of scugog, or pigeon. If you are more familiar with one lake over another, I'd stick with the ones you know best, they will all produce.  S."
1015955,AKRISONER,2017-10-19 20:48:00,5558,twin 10's in orange and black....just keep ripping them till you catch.
1015964,LostAnotherOne,2017-10-19 23:34:00,956,Caught three on upper buckhorn this past weekend.  Trolled using a bucktail with twin silver blades.  I have found i have landed more muskies since switching to silver blades instead of the orange blades these last couple of years.
1015967,KraTToR,2017-10-19 23:39:00,506,"Yea Rizzo, I'm working out near Bowmanville right now so Kawarthas are the ticket.  Thanks everyone, yes its def. a box of chocolates..lol  I'm think Sturgeon Saturday and if it produces I'll go back Sunday. If not, maybe Pigeon, Gannon's Narrows does produce from time to time."
1016056,smithy97,2017-10-21 23:24:00,70,Double 10's on Sturgeon payed off for me a couple weeks ago.
1016062,Tjames09,2017-10-22 01:40:00,664,"lots of people had this idea. Never seen so many boats on Sturgeon all fishing for musky. Was a crowded lake for Musky this Saturday, the east end had boats everywhere all look like they were musky fishing.  Yea Rizzo, I'm working out near Bowmanville right now so Kawarthas are the ticket.  Thanks everyone, yes its def. a box of chocolates..lol  I'm think Sturgeon Saturday and if it produces I'll go back Sunday. If not, maybe Pigeon, Gannon's Narrows does produce from time to time."
1016071,J Roelofsen,2017-10-22 02:52:00,84," I'll admit, I fished Sturgeon for the first time last weekend for the simple fact it's been talked up online recently. Just saying.....not trying to ruffle any feathers, I didn't find the traffic a big hindrance. Caught some fish and had a good time  Josh"
1016075,KraTToR,2017-10-22 10:39:00,506,"Heading back out to Sturg. today. Yesterday - saturday a buddy and myself caught 6, boated 4, and had several other hits and swirls.  Two were mid 40's others were around 38 to 42.  I guess that's why there a ton of boats out there...lol"
1016079,Hank Jr,2017-10-22 13:28:00,146,Sounds like a pretty good day of Muskie fishing . NO wonder you are going back today for more good luck .
1016084,Sinker,2017-10-22 14:19:00,8692,"I thought naming lakes wasn't allowed here.  Sturg has been getting POUNDED this year. More than I've ever seen. Opener was a joke. Seems like everyone is a musky fisherman now. I remember when people thought I was crazy to fish for musky. I liked that.  I just hope these ""musky pro's"" are taking good care of the fish. I have seen a lot of dead floaters out there, and some of them beautiful, big fish.  S."
1016086,fishermccann,2017-10-22 14:33:00,655,"Sinker in post # 5 you named lakes.... do as I say , not as I do ?"
1016089,Sinker,2017-10-22 15:05:00,8692,"I did, but I didn't say I caught a whole bunch of fish on lake X....just gave a suggestion."
1016096,fishermccann,2017-10-22 16:17:00,655,"As a long timer on here, who appears to know what he is talking about, some may take your opinion as gospel. Just saying."
1016106,J Roelofsen,2017-10-22 18:17:00,84,"IMO musky fishing is the next species that's gonna be seeing a BIG increase in interest. Steelhead happened about 5yrs ago, seems like everyone and their brother bought a centerpin and became a prostaffer for one company or another. It's gotten pretty bad in spots, to the point I've pretty well lost interest in several rivers I once enjoyed fishing.  IG and FB makes everything a competition and everyone a hero.....everyone is out to post more pics of more and bigger fish of a larger variety than the next guy. The fish unfortunately are on the losing end with horrible ethics and mishandling running rampant amongst the relatively uneducated newbs.  Josh"
1016109,Sinker,2017-10-22 19:00:00,8692,Haha...I doubt that very much. I will send them to Cameron from now on LOL  S.
1016143,fishermccann,2017-10-23 15:16:00,655,They would soon leave....only small wormy fish in Cameron.
1016145,jimmer,2017-10-23 15:43:00,2730,"Well I went against my advice and fished Pigeon on Sunday. I didn't get the boat out to go to another lake so we settled on Pigeon. Fished from 9am -4pm. Never saw or had a hit from a muskie. We used surface baits, cranks, jigs and numerous types of spinners. I did get a largemouth on a spinner though. LOL"
