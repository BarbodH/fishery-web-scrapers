1014911,Henricus,2017-10-06 13:11:00,118,"I am considering fishing Hamilton Harbour this weekend in my kayak and would like to hear about others recent successes.  Of course I am not looking for spots but I am curious as to frequency of catch and what species.  I understand walleye stocking seems to have taken hold and I expect largemouth and pike are in there.  Sheephead, salmon, trout and even muskie have been reported in past threads that I was researching.  I have actually been out in the spring where I felt I could literally walk across the water on the backs of all the carp.  But is there a smallmouth population worth targeting?  And as much as I enjoy hearing about a muskie caught 30 years ago I am more interested in experiences that occurred this summer and even in the last month or so.  Thanks in advance and I will let you know how I made out if I get out."
1014956,Henricus,2017-10-07 13:56:00,118,"Lasalle: closed Fishermans Wharf: closed Bronte: closed Strike 3, I'm out."
1014980,Rizzo,2017-10-07 23:10:00,4754,Too bad! Would like to know how you would do in there
1014982,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-08 00:28:00,8243,"Are they all closed because the gates are closed or no fishing posted? I would try Cootes Paradise. Less windy and have been told there are gamefish in there now as the Carp traps have worked. I would be wary of the wind in the bay. I have seen some mean water in there this time of the year especially. My department at the plant bordered the bay. East winds seemed to be worse than a west wind.  Be safe and good luck, report back."
1014992,Henricus,2017-10-08 01:44:00,118,"Lasalle was closed because the marina was pulling boats out.  Fisherman's Wharf, the gates were closed and locked.  Bronte was still closed ""due to damage""...from the high water levels I guess.  Hopefully I will get another shot but weather and schedule have to cooperate for it to happen.  Stay tuned."
1015001,Fish Farmer,2017-10-08 02:46:00,2234,"Go to Pier 4, it's open"
1015010,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-08 05:22:00,8243,Is Fisherman's Wharf where the launch is below the lift bridge? Planning on putting in at the bridge this week.
1015017,Henricus,2017-10-08 12:22:00,118,Yes....and I met another guy intending to launch there and he was just as surprised as I
1015018,dave524,2017-10-08 12:26:00,4508,It's a kayak ? do you really need a launch ?
1015022,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-08 13:03:00,8243,If Hammertown is anything like here 45 minutes south on Erie this AM I may not venture out in a Ore Freighter let alone a Kayak. Winds earlier at the Port Maitland weather buoy showed 77KPH winds earlier this AM. At 1 AM I'm out there like an idiot chasing patio furniture and got soaked after 2 minutes. Never did get back to sleep wondering which tree was going to come through the roof of this shack. Welcome Fall Windster Olympics.  Be careful my friend.
1015031,Henricus,2017-10-08 13:45:00,118,"""Kayak"" is a bit of a misnomer.  It's a Hobie PA14 and although I have launched without a ramp many times I was kind of committed to a launch the way I was rigged."
1015032,Loonietoon,2017-10-08 13:55:00,1450,Like Fishfarmer said.... got to pier 4 off Bay St and you can launch there any time.... wide open  launch
1015035,dwc67,2017-10-08 14:30:00,140,And as much as I enjoy hearing about a muskie caught 30 years ago I am more interested in experiences that occurred this summer lol how about a 36 incher caught off the weeds on the burlington side while fishing out of a kayak
1015042,Henricus,2017-10-08 17:30:00,118,"Awesome!  It's good to know there are still a few in there.  I assume you weren't targeting them??  I landed about a 34-35"" muskie in Cameron chasing smallies a couple of weeks ago in my PA...good times."
1015051,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-08 19:21:00,8243,"I just Googled your rig and watched a You Tube video, man that is more of a 14' boat than the toonie that I imagined it was. Nice ride and great exercise to boot."
1015083,Fish Farmer,2017-10-09 14:47:00,2234,"""2 x"" Go to Pier 4, it's open & free plus paved parking. plus it's where they released 200.000 Walleye. Heard a guy caught over 20 in the harbor couple weeks ago."
1015132,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-10 03:41:00,8243,A few years ago I was told it was a secret. The secret is out I guess. Guess who told me it was a secret?
1015322,Fish Farmer,2017-10-12 12:28:00,2234,"A few years ago I was told it was a secret. The secret is out I guess. Guess who told me it was a secret? Was it me Johnny, don't tell anyone"
1015336,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-12 14:44:00,8243,"Maybe. But if it was you weren't the only person that told me, a news segment on CHCH Channel 11 featured fishing Walleye in the bay."
