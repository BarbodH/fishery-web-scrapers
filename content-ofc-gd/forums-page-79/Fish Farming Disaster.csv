1015914,Fish Farmer,2017-10-19 11:01:00,2234,"Oh no, the world is coming to a end............again......LOL Sad but it's already started, just look at most people have a cel implanted into their hand. The cel is killing them selves walking out in-front of cars plus driving while celing  . Self checkouts, Gone to far being politically correct."
