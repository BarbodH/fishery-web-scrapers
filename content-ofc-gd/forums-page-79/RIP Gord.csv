1016033,Sinker,2017-10-21 14:16:00,8692,"I watched long time running last night with wet eyes. Man, some of the best times of my life have been listening to, or jamming hip tunes.  What always blows me away with Gords lyrics, is they mean so much to so many people, and all of them have a different meaning to each person. Its amazing how a whole country can relate to words, so deep, and all in a different meaning.  He will be missed, for sure, but always remembered.  S."
1016045,Pigeontroller,2017-10-21 17:22:00,2793,"Yup, was a good documentary, makes you realize how strong Gord was to get through that tour!"
1016078,fish_fishburn,2017-10-22 13:27:00,1311,"Big Hip fan here. So sad that Gord left us way to soon. The bands first 4 or 5 albums are the best in my opinion. CBC is sure milking this for all its worth, i'm sure Gord would be embarrassed by the whole deal they are putting on. Leave the man be. R.I.P. Gord Canada loves you."
1015817,SmokestackLightnin,2017-10-18 12:45:00,390,You fought a brave fight.  Thanks for everything. 
1015824,BillM,2017-10-18 13:35:00,17367,This really really sucks.
1015831,grimsbylander,2017-10-18 14:11:00,3016,A loss to millions. RIP
1015833,blaque,2017-10-18 14:46:00,2419,"Its the definition of unfair  Always remember his last visits to Buffalo on the water, one in a rainstorm"
1015838,Dutch01,2017-10-18 15:14:00,1431,A great talent and by all accounts a great man. RIP Gordie.
1015839,Jds63,2017-10-18 15:23:00,1365,"R.I.P Gord , Condolences to the Downie family ...  Thanks for all the great memories listening to your music .... truly a great Canadian !!!!!"
1015862,Cast-Away,2017-10-18 19:02:00,790,"One of the best Canadians for sure. His music touched millions. He is up there with other great Canadians living and dead such as Terry Fox, Fredrick Banting, Wayne Gretzky and Chris Hadfield to name but a few."
1015873,leaf4,2017-10-18 21:31:00,2466,"We lost a truly great man in Gord, all that embodies Canadiana shone through in how he entertained, his lyrics, style and demeanor made him a genuine guy.  Sad day today."
1015874,Pigeontroller,2017-10-18 21:40:00,2793,Man I'm sad...  
1015875,mike rousseau,2017-10-18 21:42:00,4661,Not often celebrity deaths hit home and upset me  Gord's passing has twisted my gut  His music accounts for about 10% of the songs on my phone  I was lucky enough to see the band perform live with my wife  My heart goes out to the family and the other band members... those guys are probably closer than most families
1015876,SirCranksalot,2017-10-18 21:49:00,3291,By all accounts a great human being----very sad news indeed!
1015880,muskymatt,2017-10-18 21:55:00,2608,"RIP Gord, a constant source of musical enjoyment for me and my wife for many many years. I saw them 7 times including the farewell tour in Ottawa "
1015890,FloatnFly,2017-10-18 23:06:00,1640,"Not often does a musician touch so many people.  I think just about everyone can relate to at least one of their songs.  I'm so glad I got to watch that final concert, rarely does a concert shut down a countrue  A truely great lose to music, and to Canada"
1015891,leaf4,2017-10-18 23:27:00,2466," A silver lining if you will, at least he got a farewell, and was able to really really know how much he was adored by this country and I'm sure by many many more."

1015898,Pigeontroller,2017-10-19 00:45:00,2793,"I like what the Prime Minister said, ""We are less as a Country without Gord Downie"""
1015906,Dave Bailey,2017-10-19 04:24:00,1641,"When I first heard about the diagnosis, I made a promise to myself: on the first clear night after Gord's death, I would drive to Bobcaygeon, and see the constellations reveal themselves one star at a time. I did that tonight. Here's what I put on facebook:  Lovely evening in Bobcaygeon, and I'm betting they will still be there, and long into the night. We saw the constellations reveal themselves one star at a time. The first was Aquila, the eagle. Very appropriate, given Gord's concern for the First Nations people's, and the importance their culture places on the eagle. And directly above our heads was Lyra, the lyre. It's the only constellation that represents a musical instrument, so again, fitting. I will always remember tonight.    People begin to gather at the waterfront      The Sun goes down          Candlelight on the footbridge            Local musician Richard Kyle entertains    Richard is part of a Tragically Hip tribute band, and knows the members personally.  When I left the crowd had grown considerably, and I'm sure they're still having a wonderful time."
1015917,SmokestackLightnin,2017-10-19 12:51:00,390,"To Dave Bailey, great post, thanks for sharing."
1015937,fish_fishburn,2017-10-19 17:39:00,1311,So cool.
1015942,AKRISONER,2017-10-19 18:36:00,5558,"amazing tribute, was choppin onions multiple times on during my drives yesterday when all of the radio stations down here in toronto were playing gord and gord only all day.  Man when fiddlers green came on...ouch"
1015960,Canuck,2017-10-19 22:20:00,491,"Like all of you, this hit me way harder than I thought.  Maybe getting older you start to think about mortality a bit more.  I watched a bit of the Kingston concert last night but was too emotional to enjoy it.  Will watch it on the weekend for sure.  Gord had this strange spell over us.  His lyrics were so deep and interesting.  He was an intellectual without being preachy.  He gave his poetry and let you figure it out. Humble and arrogant at the same time.He was such a great showman and one of the few bands that was even better live, and not because they played or sang the songs better.  It was something else.  It was the man.  I think there is something he has left behind for us that we will find out about soon.  I just have this feeling.  But even if he has just left the stage as he left it, its all good."
1015983,FloatnFly,2017-10-20 03:20:00,1640,"while going through videos, i found this, an unreleased song, never recorded in studio, but sang at live shows.  called montreal, commemorate the Ã‰cole Polytechnique massacre."
1015984,FloatnFly,2017-10-20 03:24:00,1640,and this one just gave me goosebumps...... a legendary Canadian song covered by a legendary Canadian band.....Enjoy!  
1015993,bow slayer,2017-10-20 14:05:00,1074,"the rock and roll talent we have lost the last few years is mind blowing,what makes it even harder is there is really nobody coming up to replace these icons.  RIP Gord."
1015997,Headhunter,2017-10-20 16:18:00,5703,"Completely agree Bowslayer. Not much ""new"" that matches the classic rock format and has the longevity to be an icon such as those we have lost lately. I honestly don't hold a lot of hope for the ""classic rock"" genre, as I do play in a classic rock bar band and gigs are getting harder to secure, as ""millennial's"" would rather Karaoke or a DJ as opposed to seeing a live band in the bars. My own one time seeing The Hip was when they opened for Rush at MLG many years ago. I'll never forget that show, not for the music, but for the first words outta Gord's mouth when he hit the stage... ""What a dump!"" And he was right, MLG was a dump! I still laugh out loud when I think of that show. HH"
