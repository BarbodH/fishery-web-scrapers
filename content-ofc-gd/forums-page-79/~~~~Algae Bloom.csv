Even at Harry's, but I spoke with him and he said I could, but good luck, because the river was clogged with a thick(2"") algae bloom cause by the fertilizers run off from the farm fields all the way down to the lake, lets hope the winds and rains we had on Sunday washes it out"
1015775,Mike Pike,2017-10-17 20:43:00,1332,Lots of blue/green algae in Hamilton Harbour as well unfortunately.  It's kept me away from carp fishing the harbour for weeks now.  I just don't like to play around the water there when it can make you sick if you're not careful.  (
1015780,Old Ironmaker,2017-10-17 21:06:00,8243,"We know all to well about Algae Bloom on Erie, 2"" thick try 2 feet thick here. Has been for years, it was here when I was an 8 year old staying at friends cottage on the lake. Why don't they get it on the US side like we do is my question?"
1015840,fishermccann,2017-10-18 15:40:00,655,Wind and currents would be my guess.
1015865,captpierre,2017-10-18 19:45:00,2521,News says big contributor to Erie is river running through Toledo Ohio. Draining immense acreage of  fertilized farmland. Didn't have a bloom here on Pigeon like some years. Zebra muscles bad on my water intake pipe. Maybe they helped.
