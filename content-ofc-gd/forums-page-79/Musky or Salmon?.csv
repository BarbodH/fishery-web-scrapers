1016026,JohnnyS,2017-10-21 03:44:00,13,Undetermined on whether to go out to Pigeon for musky or one last trip on Lake O to catch 2 yr old salmon.  Weather looks promising tomorrow so I'm thinking salmon.  Anyone having luck with musky so far this fall?
1016046,Pigeontroller,2017-10-21 17:23:00,2793,If you even have to ask...
1016047,irishfield,2017-10-21 20:13:00,26272,Too hot for Musky fishing... just doesn't feel right if you don't need a winter coat!!
1016049,porkpie,2017-10-21 20:56:00,2521,"For me that's a no brainer, I'd troll for salmon any day over catching musky.  Different strokes, do what moves you!"
1016054,captpierre,2017-10-21 22:22:00,2521,Muskie see a lot of lures in the Kawarthas this time of year. I do better in the spring on Pigeon. Had a good one grab my 2 lb smallie  the other day trolling for eyes. After jumping the bass got awefully heavy. Ski let go boat side. Maybe 40 in. Couldn't have been fun being that smallie ? I'd troll the blue zone weather permitting this time of year.
1016055,JohnnyS,2017-10-21 23:14:00,13,I went out for a few hours this afternoon.  Started in 240 FOW and trolled south.  Best action was in 280 - 300 FOW down 110'.  Temp break was at 105'.  Ended up 7/9 in just over 2.5 hrs of fishing.  I will wait for colder weather for some ski's.  Few weeks and I'll be out walleye fishing before I put the boat away on Nov 15.  I don't waste my time in the BON.
1016061,captpierre,2017-10-22 01:10:00,2521,That's great for 2.5 hrs Salmon and bows?
1016097,JohnnyS,2017-10-22 16:22:00,13,All kings from 5 - 11 lbs.  Lost a bow on 5 colour and that was the only hit on that.
