I have been surrounded by family, friends and neighbors and apologize for not getting back to everyone as promptly as I should.  Sue didn't want any sort of a funeral but we will be having a celebration of life  in a couple of weeks, I will start to sort out the details this week and post it on here.  If anyone does feel they would like to make a donation in She's name, her favorite charity was The Heart and Stroke and her full name was Susan Dale Bignell  Our address for those that have been asking is:  Pikeslayer has suggested that posting my address on line isn't a good idea so please contact him for our address.  Thanks Simon!   I am still trying to process everything, it's going to take time!"

She had suffered many heart attacks but survived them during the past 25 years. About two months ago she went into A-fib and attempts to correct it weren't successful but about a week ago she developed pneumonia. Up until this morning she was starting to show signs of improvement. Sadly her heart finally decided she had fought long and hard enough.  I am no longer half the man I used to be!
