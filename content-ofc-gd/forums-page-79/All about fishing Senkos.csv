1014452,SaugaPikeSlayer,2017-09-29 00:18:00,48," Nope.  If a pike does hit your senko they're most likely to snap your line.  Your better off using traditional pike lures.  If you do intend to target pike with senko's, just don't be that guy who uses them earlier in the season when bass season is closed.  Seen so many of these guys around that claim they're targeting pike but when they catch a bass, they gotta take pics with it.  Saw a few guys with little crank baits, light line, and no leader pre bass season this year also claiming to be out for pike. I don't play that game.  Had a really nice gar sniffer on a 4"" texas white senko earlier this month too. They seem interested in them that's for sure."
1014453,SaugaPikeSlayer,2017-09-29 00:24:00,48,Since I only got into Senko's this year I can respond about how to best store them over winter. Hopefully someone can chime in on that. I keep mine in the package in an plano box that has no dividers in it. I know some guys put them in ziplock bags. Not sure if they need to be sealed up that good or not.   I have a few bottles of the Yum F2 spray scent I got from the Le Baron sales. Thinking of marinading some senkos in zippies over the winter. Ill probably zippy the rest until next season..cant hurt.

1014869,SaugaPikeSlayer,2017-10-05 22:35:00,48,Even using the double o ring method they still seem to crack in the middle early.  Dingers and Stick-o's are my go to worms.
1014870,SaugaPikeSlayer,2017-10-05 22:36:00,48,Noted!
1014883,Bernie66,2017-10-06 01:27:00,123,Never found a need to marinate senko style baits.  Most brand names are impregnated with salt.  Bass seem to hold on to them forever.  That is why you hear of people finding sick looking bass with stomach clogged with soft plastic baits.  Marinating senkos can get very messy.  The high salt content of the Yamamoto senko is also why they break so easily.
1015145,MCTFisher9120,2017-10-10 13:57:00,3761,"Great bait to learn bass with Senko's are, but for me I catch too many small fish on them and big fish are just not consistent enough for the bait to be a player in the arsenal for me anymore so we don't even own a stick bait. I'd much rather fish quickly with tungsten texas-rigged plastic craws or lead flipping jig's and downsize the skirt, chunk and fall rate to adapt with poor fishing conditions.  For a rod a good 6'8-7'1M spinning or casting rod. Run light braid to a fluorocarbon leader. 15-10 or 20-12 would be perfect depending on the water clarity and cover."

I was fun fishing with my regular tournament partner one time, at a place we fished regularly, flipping and pitching plastic worms to cover, shallow clear water. We were using the same brand, style, and size worms, fishing the same spots with our casts, the only difference was color. I was using junebug, which had always worked well for both of us in the past, that day he put on a watermelon blue, and had 3-4 fish in the boat and I didn't get a hit, that was enough for me to go to that color! As soon as I changed colors bites happened and fish were caught.  After that incident we almost always used different colors when starting, dark and light. If we had been fishing alone? we might have stuck with one color and just figured the fish weren't there or inactive?"

1011468,bobowski,2017-08-16 19:09:00,360,Senko fishing wacky rigged can and has become addicting for me. Watching your line twitch or slowly getting pulled away and anticipating the hook set really gets the blood pumping. IMO its more about finding the fish and putting it in front of them fishing this way rather than the colour of the senko. Usually if the bass can see it on the fall they will hit it. With this being said I do try to stay more natural with my colour selection the more clear that the water is and use brighter colours in stained water.
1011488,misfish,2017-08-16 22:30:00,29133,"I have never had an issue using straight braid, I find when fishing bass, it,s a reaction bait. The spots I will fish them, are in heavy cover or under docks, floating swim platforms. If they want it, they will take it. I will make long casts, and just watch the line. I  rig it weedless. I will run the hook through it and up the line, and work it til 3/4 down the worm. Pop it through, and then just press the hook through the worm. I can drag it over pads and heavy cover. When I see an open hole, I just let it drop down.  I find this method has a better hook ratio for me. Hook in the middle, they can grab either end and the fish and you, miss.  Just my experience with the worm.  As for colors, well, I like pumpkin seed and white with black or gold fleck."
1011517,BassMan11,2017-08-17 12:31:00,583,I fish them on a Loomis 6'8 E6X medium x-fast paired with a Ci4 with 15lb power pro hi vis yellow line and a 12lb floro leader. I like a weighted wacky hook as I believe its a bit or versatile fishing shallow or deeper water. Lots of clear smallmouth lakes in the Ottawa valley and the fish are a bit deeper during the summer. I find on high pressure lake the wiggle of a Yamamoto might trigger a few more strikes then the other brands. If I am heading up north and bass are around I would get some Yum dingers as they are half the price and a bit more durable.  I have caught more numbers of fish on this bait than anything else. Although after a week of fishing it's tough to look back and see you went through over $100 in plastics worms.

This...  i literally used 1 single yum dinger for an entire weekend and caught over 15 fish on one worm.  Its true the yamasenkos have that ridiculous wobble, but i get p-oed when i cast and they rip in half."
1011522,KawarthaAngler,2017-08-17 13:26:00,273,"I have found it to be quite difficult to cast a weightless wacky worm setup on a bait caster because of the backlash.  The reel needs to be set pretty loose to get any casting distance on such a light lure and backlash was too common for me.  All my rods are bait casters, but I have one spinning reel setup and that is for wacky worm (which I usually have setup weightless because the lakes where I fish aren't very deep (less than 20ft))."
1011525,boombap,2017-08-17 13:43:00,310,I use baitcasters 90% of the time but I use a mojo bass 'wacky style' spinning rod for both my wacky and shaky heads. Works great.

1011534,AKRISONER,2017-08-17 15:56:00,5558,"Are you using an O-ring? Using one will extend the life of your worm immensely.  yes sometimes, but it has actually reduced my number of hook ups...sounds ridiculous but i notice a difference for sure."
1011535,KawarthaAngler,2017-08-17 16:01:00,273,It makes sense there would be less hookups due to the positioning of the hook in relation to the direction the fish attacks the worm.
1011573,SaugaPikeSlayer,2017-08-18 01:19:00,48,"Use two o rings..cross them over and stick the hook where they cross...the hook will also sit perpendicular to the worm, not parallel like it does with one ring."
