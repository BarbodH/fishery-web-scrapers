1015853,rhymobot,2017-10-18 17:57:00,174,Hi.  Each of those lakes are 55 to 65 minutes from me. I've only fished them as late as early August. I know the weeds are bad then. But can someone tell me from experience if around this time of the year they have died down to May or June levels?  I fish a small lake 45 minutes north of Barrie when I'm at the cottage and the past two Septembers the beautiful healthy looking weeds that hold so many bass in this 10 foot lake basically collapsed by mid Sept. Like right to the bottom. Not all the weed beds but I'd say most of them.  So I'm wondering what the above mentioned lakes might look like before I make the drive and pay to launch my inflatable.  Thanks for any tips.
