Spoke to a few local angler (the ones that are out almost every day) and they said it has been really slow, a few rainbow trout have been caught, mostly smaller ones (or so I've been told).  The river was busy with anglers, more that what I like to be around fishing with so my stay was about 1.5 hrs before I started exploring for less occupied locations.  As Wayne mentioned just above, with this rain maybe we'll see some more fish head into the river."

Planning on taking this Thursday & Friday off to fish for rainbow and maybe leftover salmons around Thornbury/Meaford area and curious about how the water level and rain condition have been  any more information would be greatly appreciated"
