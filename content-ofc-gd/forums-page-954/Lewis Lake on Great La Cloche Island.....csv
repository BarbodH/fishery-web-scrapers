I know the island is entirely privately owned, but I had read that Mr. Fielding at some point had a free public camp site on the lake. I think he died about 4 years ago and cannot find much further info. Also, if someone owns an island with lakes, does this mean they also own the islands on the lakes on the island?! Or would you be free to camp on them provided there is public access to the lake?"
