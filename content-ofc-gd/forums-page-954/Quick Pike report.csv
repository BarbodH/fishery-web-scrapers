257869,jjcanoe,2008-10-13 00:31:00,744,"Went out to Wildwood conservation area near St. Marys this afternoon for a few hours and all I we could manage was one pike.  But according to a few people we talked to ""you shoulda been here yesterday"" Beautiful day on the water, with just a few small gusts of wind to keep the heat away.  The water was pretty murky since the algae die-off. Got this guy on a chartreuse spinnerbait and measured him out at 30""     jjcanoe"
