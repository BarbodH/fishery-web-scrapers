247726,pikeie,2008-09-08 19:26:00,380,the entire river looks like this right now!! i just moved up to sault ste. marrie for school and the pink salmon fishing is amazing. there are schools of 200-300 fish moving at some times  i wish i could get some pictures up but i dont have a way to yet.
247759,bigugli,2008-09-08 21:16:00,6138," Fine, be that way!   JWL and I are both green with envy. Loved fishing below the dam."
247767,Dano,2008-09-08 21:36:00,719,Anyone ever see any indigenous fish aside from the suckers?
247775,Mattones,2008-09-08 22:06:00,587, haha. I didn't eat it. Just cut the head off.
247783,Dara,2008-09-08 22:35:00,3052,"  That camera is on the Michigan side of the river. Snagging is legal in Michigan  Not something I partake in, but, legal nonetheless"
247785,Dara,2008-09-08 22:37:00,3052,"  I'm guessing Sault College My son just started there, and my wife teaches there.  Oh yeah, the fishing part...Jumbo pearch are in at Bells point now. you can catch a bucket of 12 to 14 inchers in no time"
247911,dobee,2008-09-09 11:38:00,301,"wow, love this live feed!  im watching a massive lamprey having tis way with a small chinook.  this guy here looks like he has a tumor or something on his side   what a ton of fish! "
247913,solopaddler,2008-09-09 11:50:00,8605,"  Snagging used to be legal in Michigan, a loong time ago though. Those dark days spawned the infamous ""Michigan cricket"", a large chunk of lead moulded around a treble hook. A terminal rig favoured by countless bank mutants  .  If people are snagging in this day and age they're breaking the law."
247942,Wild,2008-09-09 13:32:00,704," This link comes from the Michigan DNR web site under unlawful activities read  ""snag fish or retain fish not hooked in the mouth"" near the end.  http://www.michigan.gov/documents/dnr/unla...es_229814_7.pdf    The web site: http://www.michigan.gov/documents/dnr/unla...es_229814_7.pdf  So I hope that clears up the issue for good in Michigan. However Illinois does seem to allow  snagging  for salmon in certain locations when I did a bit of research but I am not going to confirm it."
247969,pikeie,2008-09-09 16:01:00,380, yep fish and wildlife conservation tech
248015,Bob,2008-09-09 19:10:00,370,"I've been watching that for several years now.  The old camera was higher definition and easier to look at, don't know what happened there.  Got a surprise the other day though, I just happened to look in right before they yanked the camera to clean the lens and I was looking at clouds and a cleaner brush for a couple of minutes."
248056,Dara,2008-09-09 21:58:00,3052,"  Hmmmm OK, Sorry bout that. its been years since I fished over ther and haven't kept up. Hope I didn't get anybody busted"
248059,Dara,2008-09-09 21:59:00,3052,  Been years since I went there too. I woulda guessed Forestry tech.
258282,Wild,2008-10-14 18:02:00,704,Looks like the Coho's are now in the river
258329,rickster,2008-10-14 20:43:00,495,  maybe you should have a couple of drinks before your next outing
245895,Wild,2008-09-02 18:01:00,704,"This is the live video camera situated in the St Mary's River ( USA side)by the Edison Sault Power Station The link has been posted before but here is the large screen version  http://www.ustream.tv/videoplayerpopup/166657.usc    And the University link, with more info on the cam and location is on the site:  http://www.lssu.edu/arl/fishcam.php  And for the smaller video pic click:  http://www.lssu.edu/arl/fishcamlive.php   This is the Panoramio page with  one pic plus Google Earth location of the power plant.  http://www.panoramio.com/photo/1901743"

245905,yellowboat,2008-09-02 18:46:00,211,"Hmmm hope they wait for me, I'll be up in 2 weeks fishing the river."
245907,tbayboy,2008-09-02 19:01:00,1497,"The way they keep looking at the camera reminded me of this bit of classic movie trivia (The Meaning of Life)  FISH #1: Morning. FISH #2: Morning.

245909,ehg,2008-09-02 19:07:00,2666,"Kinda like having an aquarium in your computer.  This would be good for practicing salmon identification. Seen mostly Atlantics and the odd Pink(some with lamprey) so far. Great link, ehg"
245912,ccmtcanada,2008-09-02 19:15:00,7971, Problem is the fish I catch aren't that blurry....
245919,Carp,2008-09-02 19:39:00,1488,Very cool. Thanks for the link Wild. Now where exactly is it you said that camera was placed ?  Would be really neat to see more of these underwater cameras around.
245947,Wild,2008-09-02 20:55:00,704,Ooops  sorry guys I forgot to place the University Link I added more info.  Sometimes around 7 PM I noticed the suckers and carp will move in for dinner too.
245956,yellowboat,2008-09-02 21:46:00,211,"It's located at the Edison power house in the St Mary's river Sault Ste. Marie, MI"
245967,Marko,2008-09-02 22:17:00,854,Thats awesome! I wonder if they like marshmallows
245978,TJQ,2008-09-02 23:07:00,7806,Very cool.. LSSU is my Alma Mater - class of '87!!
247159,Wild,2008-09-06 16:00:00,704,Fish are really beginning to stack up!  TJ let's hear some stories about LSSU! Sounds like a great experience.
247166,Billy - Curtiss,2008-09-06 16:37:00,241,Mind blowing! Thanks for the link.
247168,Mattones,2008-09-06 16:48:00,587,I just saw a HUGEEE Eel on one of these guys. wow.
247170,jwl,2008-09-06 16:51:00,1056,"just an added reminder of what the water really looked like teaming with fish in a few spots I used to fish on the St Mary's, pretty cool to see all the fish, what a great teaser"
247171,Wild,2008-09-06 16:57:00,704,"That is a lamprey and yes I have seen some huge ones recently, actually more than I want to see."
247179,jwl,2008-09-06 17:16:00,1056," they have had huge lamprey problems for years in that area...right by the dam and locks on Canada side of the St Mary's is the MNR building, and a lamprey research lab...if you are fishing near there, there is a part that is open to the public you can go walk through and check it out and learn about lamprey's and some of the steps they take to try and control them..it's a pretty cool little thing.  Also right thereat the dam the MNR has a lamprey trap, when I lived there about 12 years ago I would often see them haul it up and empty it..they would litterally shovel them out of the trap into big green garbage cans on a flat bed truck, sometimes there where so many they spilled out overflowing onto the road"
247182,lunkerbasshunter,2008-09-06 17:28:00,2585,that is cool!  thanks for the link  cheers!
247184,Wild,2008-09-06 17:35:00,704,"Too bad there are no real predators of the lamprey in the great lakes besides man. I heard they are edible and considered to be a delicacy by some, well i don't know about that anyone try them?"
247193,TJQ,2008-09-06 18:15:00,7806, A great experience it was!!!   The last year I had a very light schedule... from what I remember.. stories... hmm don't really have any I can tell here... lol
247226,Dara,2008-09-06 20:57:00,3052,Hey guys  guess what   with a Michigan fishing license SNAGGING is legal right beside that camera
247246,Mattones,2008-09-06 22:48:00,587, When I was out on lake O on Sunday a friend caught one with a lamprey on it.
247277,Wild,2008-09-07 00:59:00,704,How did it taste Matt?
247692,mpt,2008-09-08 17:00:00,158,Snagging is only allowed if you're part of a treaty. I've never heard of eating lamprey i don't think they taste very good. Eel on the other hand are very tasty.
