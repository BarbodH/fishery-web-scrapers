257972,silverstreak,2008-10-13 15:35:00,146,Clear water weekend meant few chrome. A brown/orange jig combo( Daiichi hook) made all the difference. For those who want to try jigs.......Don't cheap out on jig Hooks or you may be talking about the one that got away. Spend the few extra pennies and the results will speak for themselves. Cheers.
