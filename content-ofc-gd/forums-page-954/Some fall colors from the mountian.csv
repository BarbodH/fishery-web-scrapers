I was asked to take a special lady out to see the colors of this time of year and I was not about to pass up on it. We headed to the mountians of Collingood and well the colors were not at thier peak,it was a great day and the scenery was awesome.              Amazing was this old chair lift.        We could hear this sound coming above us,but we have no idea what these birds are.They made a clucking sound. At first I thought they were swans,but they were not.    The mountain was very busy not with just site seeiers, but mountian bikers. Man some of these bikes were pretty hitec.    I found this perfect ledge for a photo op,but I was the only taker on it.LOL    The entertianment was also a great laugh.     Also founf my chandelier.LOL     Now for what I am thankful for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This women took me back after a month of hell.That I am truely grateful for.      Happy thanks giving to you all and enjoy and love what you have. I found out myself,I have everything I ever need right here."
