I figured everyone would be eating or hanging out with family for thanksgiving. There were two couples of eastern European decent set up still fishing for carp with corn off to one side and another gentleman using worms on the other side. We had about 30ft between them to cast our jig & grub combos hoping to catch some smallies.  I caught this one after about 5 minutes on a white 1/8oz jig & grub. My daughter, who had just learned to lip bass this summer at Pigeon lake, decided she would hold and release any fish I caught. She only fished about ten minutes before she lost interest.  She decided to name the fish as I caught them. This one was greeny.  This is stripes.  After having no action on her orange jig w/pumpkinseed grub, my wife and I swapped so she could throw the white one. I then caught this one on her jig and pole. It was the biggest of the evening and splashed my daughter when she released it.  The moon is almost full as we called it an evening just before 7pm. In the hour we spent there, I caught 6 smallies, the worm fisherman caught 2 suckers around 2lbs and the European couples landed and kept one carp around 5lbs and lost one at the shore that was close to 12lbs. They were all quite entertained by my little one as she talked to the fish when she released them. We said goodbye to everyone wishing them a happy thanksgiving and good luck. You gotta love the Grand   ."
