257702,jediangler,2008-10-12 04:54:00,1923,Sweet smallies bushart. You gotta love them when they colour up like that.

257727,bushart,2008-10-12 11:57:00,2628,"  Thanks for the invite---I've also got some boys from Florida that I guided for deer wanting me to come down---I may make it some year. Actually if your on one of those Lakair Pilgramages you could travel a little east and I could take you out on some different water (Ottawa Valley).  These fish did not come from Lake Simcoe, Couch, Erie, or the other bodies most connect with big smallies but from right near my home. Also if you guys get together around this time of year--Huge Smallies are extremely predictable and easy to catch---This picture was only 2 fish we photo'd most we caught were in this size class and one hawger in the 5 plus class.
