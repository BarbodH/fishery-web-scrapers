I prefere fly fishing, but i'll use spinner rods if i have to. I know there are many streams and lakes around me that have fish, but i am curios about the humber river.  I know they stock browns there, its just I have never caught one. The only thing i catch there is chub. I am just wondering if any body here has caught one in the upper river, thanks.  Small Catch"
