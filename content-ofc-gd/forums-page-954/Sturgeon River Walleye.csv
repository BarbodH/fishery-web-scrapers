258027,Muskieman,2008-10-13 20:20:00,2472,My daughter and I managed to catch 18 Walleye today and managed to keep 6... most were in the slot.  here's a pic.
258039,rob v,2008-10-13 21:10:00,535,Nice looking fish Dan.  I wasn't able to make it to Sturgeon falls/nippissing this year for the first time in about a dozen or so years.   The guys I usually went with were too tied up with work this year.  Hopefully next year we'll be able to put our annual trip together again.  I sure miss your part of the country at this time of the year ! Rob V

258083,Muskieman,2008-10-14 00:07:00,2472,  Megan was coughing on the water ... when it came time to take the pics she had put her PJ's on and grabbed the bottle of cough syrup...  That's what I take when I run out of Beer!
258084,Muskieman,2008-10-14 00:11:00,2472,   I seen Mario...  he was in a BIG fiberglass tub...25 foot or so.   ......  EH!   Clamp-It .....how do you know Mario &  Al   S...?................I used to work w/ Mario and I know Al pretty good too.... I did the airbrush on his limo.
258091,Greencoachdog,2008-10-14 00:34:00,8163,I see 3 Wall-ice and 3 Pickerals in that pic (the big ones are Wall-ice)  Nice fish and pic!!!
258094,rob v,2008-10-14 00:41:00,535,"That 25 foot fiberglass unit is likely the boat they took us out in the last 3 years.  They took us (3 or 4 guys) plus Mario and the boat owner, Mario's buddy Al - over to the mouth of the french.  Al's from southern ontario but spends a lot of time fishing Nippising.  We had great fishing out there the last 3 years and as you know Mario (and Al) know the water there pretty well.  Great guys, great water and great fishing.   Sure missed it this year."
