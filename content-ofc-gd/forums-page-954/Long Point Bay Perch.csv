Fish were between St. Williams and Port Rowan in about 6' of water. Unfortunatly I didn't get any pictures but I will be back out next weekend with my camera."

257971,danbouck,2008-10-13 15:23:00,4380, Ya there were quite a few out by EC10 and it started filling up where I was by the time I left. I was going to head out there to give it a shot but I figured there was no point in leaving a good spot.  and yes the perch sat next to the turkey at the dinner table
