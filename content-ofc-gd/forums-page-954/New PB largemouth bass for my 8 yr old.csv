Check out my 8 year old with his new PB largemouth. 3 lbs on the digital scale  Love the wacky style fishing. Casted out on my 103HA Steez and Avid rod, watch the line go sideways and handed the rod to my son. We were using circle hooks and told him that you do not have to set the hook just start reeling in. The results after a couple minute fight and some great jumps:    Jose"
