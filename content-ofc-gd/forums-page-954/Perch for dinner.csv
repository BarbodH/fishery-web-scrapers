The numbers were only okay but the size was poor.  Heard a couple of guys talking about perch on bluff's bar so with the great weather I decided to head out there.  Glad I did.   Had to mover around to find them, but when you got onto a pocket of fish they were pretty good.   Took home around 30 (just me fishing) with a couple approaching 14 inches.   Great day on the water.    "

258048,Leecher,2008-10-13 21:50:00,7832,Cool Rob V     Great job  Thanks for sharing Leechman
258063,Sandbag,2008-10-13 22:43:00,533,Nice Rob  How were the winds out at the Bluffs.  That can be a long ride back in if they pick up.  Cheers  Craig
258064,medmart,2008-10-13 22:44:00,587,Nice catch Rob V how long does it take you to clean them?  Rob
258066,rob v,2008-10-13 22:55:00,535,"Craig - The weather was great Friday - so in 20 minutes or so I was there.  But you're right - when/if the wind pick up it can be a lot longer.  Gotta watch the weather - or hug the shore.  Memart - cleaning is the price you pay.  I can have them done, bagged and in the fridge/freezer in a couple of hours.  That's why i don't like to keep anything much less than 8 or 9 inches or so.  But it's worth it."
