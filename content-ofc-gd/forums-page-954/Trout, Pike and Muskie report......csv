257625,ccmtcanada,2008-10-12 00:28:00,7971,"Bly and I have been out quite a bit in the past 2 or 3 weeks...mostly at night, but have been skunked on a fairly regular basis....LOL.  I figured I'd put a combo report of the past weeks......  A few weeks ago, we were trying in vain to catch some late Salmon....chucking cleos in hopes of another big one.  The only thing hitting that night was this surprise pike!   This past week, after the rains we had on Wednesday, we decided to hit a trib to see if we could coax any early steelhead to hit on Thursday night.  Conditions looked good....about 10 inches of visibility, levels slightly elevated.  Using roe, I managed to first pull this little guy from the dark waters....   Finally....the first decent sized steelhead for me...took me for a bit of a ride....had to get used to using the float rod again!!   Fast forward to today.  We had the whole day to fish, so we decided to see if there were any other steelhead in the creeks.  We arrived at the trib around 830 and started walking...methodically checking every likely spot they'd potentially hide out in.  All we could manage were a bunch around this size.  Still fun to catch though!     It soon got too HOT out to keep on walking the trib, so we came home around noon, hooked up the boat and headed off to Lake Scugog.  The conditions were great out there...no real winds, warm temperatures and hardly any boats out there.  We tried casting for muskie for a while with no action whatsoever, so we decided we'd troll around to cover more water.  For the first 3 hours we didn't even have a sniff.  Then finally....around 5pm, I feel a nice hit on the troll!  I begin to reel and fight the fish, but when it was about 30 feet from the boat I lost it!!  Crap!!  Carole then noticed that the moon had just poked over the horizon, and remembering what Lew said about moonrise and set...we decided to stay a little while longer.   Wouldn't you know it....about 20 minutes later, I feel another hit!  They had suddenly turned on and were chasing baits close to the surface.  This was to be the only fish in the boat for the day...a smallish one, but I'll take it any day!!!   Off to swim another day!   Well, that pretty much sums up our last 2 or 3 weeks of fishing.....hopefully we can get a few more fall muskies before the season closes!"

257764,limeyangler,2008-10-12 15:31:00,5204,Great report as per usual cliff....love the muskies you catch....i'm still a virgin (catching muskies that is.....otherwise my pregnant wife has some explaining to do)
257796,Greencoachdog,2008-10-12 18:37:00,8163,btw... The time spent not catching fish and catching small ones gives the big ones time for their mouths to heal up from that whippin' y'all put on them!!!  
257897,ehg,2008-10-13 01:51:00,2666,"Nice variety of fishes and real fine looking musky. Those larger bows are a blast and great fighters. Thanks for posting, ehg"
257989,ccmtcanada,2008-10-13 17:01:00,7971,Thanks everyone....seems like lots of fish...but catching in 4 of 16 outings isn't good....LOL.  And Glen...there are no other pics we are holding back at this point....haha.
258005,Wild,2008-10-13 18:14:00,704,"Ok so you guys haven't been pulling in the numbers of fish but all these ones are beauties! And it's great to see the youngins too.  hmmm now let's see, we need some walleye, jumbo perch, crappie and a few bass pic from you guys before the snow flies so get to it"

258301,snag,2008-10-14 19:07:00,1932,Brilliant as always!  Mixed bags are great.  I think you live in a central location to be able to hop to fruitful fishing holes by the hour.  Well done!
