258290,ehg,2008-10-14 18:39:00,2666,"Thanks for further replies! The last few larger muskies have been surprises while trolling over deep water towards structure. Hmmm... maybe a new strategy.  There seems to be large fish in that huge northern main basin of Pigeon. Meely caught a bunch around 50"" he posted this summer. Thanks again, ehg"
258295,snag,2008-10-14 18:58:00,1932,Nice to see that everytime you hit that Lake there are some nice catches.  I guess I'll have to go grab that shad now!  Thanks
258461,1Harringtona,2008-10-15 01:36:00,77,that 43 incher looks like it would eat you for lunch if you fell in the water lol
257699,ehg,2008-10-12 04:43:00,2666,"Hi folks, Had some time today so tried fishing Pigeon Lake. The bass seem to disappear from usual spots so walleye were targetted mostly on this fine fall day. It was real beautiful and quietish on the lake today. My buddy Dave was certainly happy to get out fishing.   Not much wind so vertical jigging for eyes seemed relaxing and the choice of day. Caught a bunch of smallish walleye this way.     None of these fish were very big but kept us busy catching and having fun. Dave says get the net but this one didn't turn out big either.  Were hitting these fish constantly was a gonna take a few home for eating but forgot to take any.  Caught some big colourful bluegill and rockbass as well.   Figured we would try trolling for muskies since might be last time up this way for the season. So i put on my trusty perch SuperShad Rap and buddy put on his favorite lure and trolling we went. Shortly into trolling while in middle of nowhere over 45' of water i got a hit. Turned out to be a chunky musky. Got it near the boat and it jumped and thrashed around.   Turned out to be a fat 43 inch fish.  Did get a picture with OFC sign for entry into tourney as well.  Didn't want to fish topwaters but with calm conditions tried anyways. Caught some little largies but didn't fish that way too long.   Turned out to be a real picturesque fall day with decent fishing, had a great time today. Too bad the days are shorter now it really flew by.  Cheers, ehg"

257748,Chris,2008-10-12 13:43:00,405,Rizzo  That's typical of suspended fish. Note that he caught it over 45' of water.  Nice muskie and a nice action shot!

257907,ehg,2008-10-13 02:21:00,2666,"Thanks for replies and happy thanksgiving! Certainly has been a beautiful weekend so far.   Thanks Mark, used those jig/sassy shad back in the CSF days, remember that... lol  Mike that is my oldest, most chewed up lure but it stll runs great and catches fish. I'll keep using it.  It was the quickest release of a fish for me. Couple quick pictures and it immediately took off once it hit the water. It was barely hooked. "
257930,solopaddler,2008-10-13 11:13:00,8605,Doesn't get much better than that.
