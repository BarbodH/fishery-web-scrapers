The CB was the first to fire, a little king about 8#.  picked up another king and a bow around 7-8#.  on spoons on the stackers around 25-35ft. nk28 wahoo and green frog.  Things started to slow so we headed out to 250fow. Found some better temps and started to mark some good fish. picked up a scrappy coho about 8# on the CB set up.  Then we got into a double of big bows, on the CB and the Skiens Machine. I was fighting mine when the rod beside me went I grabbed it too and past one off to my buddy. I landed mine a nice 15# hen still healing up from the spawn. The other fish was much bigger could have went almost 20# broke the 50# flouro leader at the boat. I lost my last CB fly. so I switch to a PRO AM fly and CB spinny and it fired for another king.  We ended up 6 or 7 for 10. with a good mix of fish. Slow ride back with that thick fog, thank god for electronics   The new Crazy B*tch spinny looks like its going to be a great combo!!        "
