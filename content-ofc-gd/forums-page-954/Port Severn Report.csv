256002,Rizzo,2008-10-06 21:55:00,4754,"Got out in the Port Severn area on Saturday. No luck for a long time and then the fish turned on. My partner caught a nice fat 42 inch fish trolling a black bucktail with orange blade as we trolled back and forth over a deep weed edge. We were in 20 feet of water when it hit as we were heading back towards the shallower weeds. A few hundred meters later, I caught my ugliest musky to date. Here it is, a face only a mother could love. Half his face was missing, and the body was real banged up too.   We caught the ugly one trolling across a rocky point, again in approx 20 feet of water. It was caught on a footlong Storm crankbait and measured in at 44 inches. Hit so hard I actually thought I had snagged bottom. Didn't even give me the telltale head shakes. We even backed up the boat to the spot only to have the fish surface beside the boat! Rather embarrassing to me as I was complaining about being snagged. I've heard of others think the same thing, but I always figured I would be able to tell the difference! "
256004,irishfield,2008-10-06 22:01:00,26272,"Good stuff Rizzo ! You'd think the poor bugger, looking like that, would have stopped chasing bait by now"
256005,Terry,2008-10-06 22:05:00,14456,he is ugly......
256006,Roy,2008-10-06 22:05:00,13728,"Congrats on the catches, Roger. Yeah, that one fish looks like it might have attacked one prop too many. You did good. Thanks for sharing that."
256011,fishnpro,2008-10-06 22:20:00,93,Looks like someone didn't take the time to take the hook out properly.
256020,mattyk,2008-10-06 23:01:00,2110,thanks for the report!
256039,AzuluSpookd,2008-10-07 00:08:00,348,That's the fish that GBFisher probably caught....cuz he trolls so fast
256050,bigugli,2008-10-07 00:28:00,6138,"It wouldn't surprise me if the big fellow had an argument with a prop. We were drift trolling on the electric when we got a big thump, thump, thump. Thought I hit a snag, turned of the motor. Looked down just in time to see one big muskie hit the prop and dive. Obviously our lures weren't big enough."
256053,fishindevil,2008-10-07 00:49:00,6254,"Well i guess one ugly muskie is better than no muskies right !!!??.  ...nice day on the water just the same,thanks for the report...cheers"
256057,Greencoachdog,2008-10-07 00:56:00,8163,"You were snagged Rizz!... in a fishes mouth!!!  That is one tough ol' bugger Musky!!!  Looks better than some of the kids these days with that ""piercing"" crap hanging out of their face!!!... and don't even get me started on the so called ""men"" that wear ear rings!!!"
256063,Leecher,2008-10-07 01:05:00,7832,Great stuff Rizzo     We got skunk yesterday so even I would of liked to hook something..... even the ugliest.  Good job and thanks for sharing Leechman
256065,Rizzo,2008-10-07 01:10:00,4754,"Here is another picture of the same fish...didn't have time to include it in initial report. Whoever was thinking this fish may have tangled with a prop may be on to something. It was pretty banged up but seems to have healed up alright, swam away strong from its latest misfortune as well!  "
256086,Joey,2008-10-07 02:33:00,9122,She's ugly yet beautiful at the same time  Couple more beer and she'll be gorgeous Roger  Joey
256090,Wild,2008-10-07 03:06:00,704,Yep surely looks like that one is hooked on crack.
256096,jwl,2008-10-07 03:31:00,1056,"the hit by a prop idea is no so far fetched..often for example at my trailer..boating down the lake in the mid lake open water, I spook muskies sitting on the top in the middle of nowhere..you could hit one...and in fall of 2007 while up at my trailer with a few fishing friends for a couple day mission, a big musky came and hit at my friend Bill's electric trolling motor, Bigugli was running the electrics, and they where working a weededge off from a sandy beach area when ...pathunk...!!!, he looks down to see the giant slowly swim away after not getting away with a meal  We kidded around about our baits being way to small after that"
256115,lew,2008-10-07 09:30:00,12767,"Looks like that ole boy has had a tough life Roger, but at least you got into a couple fish.We were over on GBay Saturday but other than one follow and a couple pike that was it for us for the day.  The Upper Niagara musky trip will be Dec 13th this year, hope your gonna join us as usual ??"
256121,b2kptbo,2008-10-07 10:50:00,1505,"Thats one beat-up ski, must be a pretty tough fish to rebound back..."
256124,MCTFisher9120,2008-10-07 11:01:00,3761,Congrads on the big fish!
256146,joonmoon,2008-10-07 13:24:00,528,"The snag/fish back up the boat thing is funny. Happens to a lot of us. Nice work with the ski, she really looks like she needs an attitude adjustment with the snarl and all. Awesome. WTG with the successful release."
257165,snag,2008-10-10 04:26:00,1932,"Very nice!  O.k. it was ugly but like my girlfriends from long ago......  Man,  THEY LOOK HOT NOW!!!!!!   "
257871,ravinerat,2008-10-13 00:36:00,64,That's one scary face for sure. Oh man don't think I want that in the boat.  RR
258046,Squid,2008-10-13 21:47:00,1656,Yeah I'd say that that fish tangled with a prop. Nice fish though Roger. See you on the upper.
