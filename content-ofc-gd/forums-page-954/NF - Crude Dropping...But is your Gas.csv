257256,anders,2008-10-10 14:10:00,1168,"Just wondering if your local gas stations are dropping there prices.  Crude is under 80 a barrel and we are still paying 121.  here.  We have been paying that for  few days now.  I know we have heard this all before, but just wondering if other stations are dropping the price in gas."
257260,youngvedder,2008-10-10 14:28:00,72,"gas went down to 105.5 the other day, but again as crude has gone down, our prices today have risen to 109.7.....hmmm, and they say price is directly proportionate!  I would love to see when crude was 80/barrel last year what was the price at the pump? I would bet it wasn't over $1/ltr...."
257261,yellowboat,2008-10-10 14:29:00,211,We were at 103 yesterday and this morning it was 107.  They're really gouging no eh!  Bend over for the weekend.
257276,Leecher,2008-10-10 15:07:00,7832,1.09 in the Outaouais region as of this morning
257279,Dartee,2008-10-10 15:14:00,47,Was $1.007/liter in Brockville this morn.
257282,ccmtcanada,2008-10-10 15:18:00,7971,My gas has gone down.  Oh wait...you mean for the car right?  Heard today the slight increase was due to profit taking despite the fact that oil went down.
257285,muskie_bob,2008-10-10 15:21:00,13,Gas was up to 1.09 in the Golden Horseshoe area in Ontario today.  One problem that is negatively affecting what we pay for gas besides taxes and gouging is the fact that the Canadian dollar has dropped over 10% in the last week or so and we pay for our gas in US$.  Still it is very frustrating.

257366,John,2008-10-10 19:00:00,2956,I get gas every time I get gas..........  Canadian $ is on a free fall so expect prices at the pump to increase regardless of the drop in crude.
257381,Wild,2008-10-10 19:27:00,704,"Your right John this will be their excuse. Worse than gas however, will the stores start raising prices on merchandise in time for us to buy Christmas."

HOWEVER, I fish out of Cattaraugus Creek (boat launch) when perch fishing Lake Erie and the Seneca Nation gas stations are down to $2.88 per US gallon. YES, you read it right under $3 per gallon here  BTW the perch fishing is pretty good in 72 feet of water. Got 25 Wed and another 30 today. Going out again in the morning while this GREAT fall weather holds."
257831,Billy Bob,2008-10-12 21:53:00,5865,CORRECTION............. Gas today at the Reservation was $2.66 per US gallon
257837,holdfast,2008-10-12 22:04:00,1813,Still 121 here.  I think they're waiting for crude to go up so they can start raising prices again.  This time using a high price to start with.  Crooks I say.  Id love to lynch someone.  I would laugh when he starts to cry.
