Still ticked with myself though, that I never thought to take a fishing rod with me and then we spent all Friday afternoon on the side of the Rideau River and I could have fished the whole stretch below the Bronson St Bridge from shore.  Some beautiful colours in the trees that line GBay right now for sure."
