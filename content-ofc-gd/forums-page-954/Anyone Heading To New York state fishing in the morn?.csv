257641,charlied,2008-10-12 01:08:00,584,just curious if anyone here was....cause I am.  Thought might be able to hook up with some partner fishing tribs!
257791,charlied,2008-10-12 17:58:00,584,it was a bust....kinda made me wanna throw up thou....100 snaggers fishing.  It was a disgace to call them fisherman.  I didn't even bring my rod out of the truck once I saw all the vehicles.  Will post the pics later! seen 30 fish landed in 10 minutes and all were snagged in the side!

257805,glirw,2008-10-12 20:21:00,200,"I guess when in Rome, get your butt back to Canada!"
257829,Billy Bob,2008-10-12 21:47:00,5865,"I have be to the Catt on Lake Erie Wed, Sat and Today.  NO ONE is stagging there. It is illegal to snag in NYS and there are MANY DEC officers in the field.  With all that said they are catching many stealhead at the Catt but I have been fishing perch. This is also the time to fill the freezer with JUMBO perch..........."
257867,charlied,2008-10-13 00:27:00,584,ya i made the bad decision of going to lake ontario tribs.  And yes I know it is not new news.
257942,tipupesox,2008-10-13 12:53:00,167,I won't even venture to a Lake Ontario trib in NYS until the cold weather sets in around November/December.  Not worth dealing with the yahoo's.  The Lake Erie streams are running gin clear but are holding fish but they have been pressured over the last week.  I generally don't fish the Catt in the Fall but I would say it is probably your best bet under the current conditions.  Need some rain to get a new push of fish and to make the fish less spooky.
257988,charlied,2008-10-13 16:54:00,584,"thanks for the advice tipupesox.....its hard cause I really only have sundays to fish, unless i get offered overtime.  can't wait till november cause thats when I start fishing whirlpool and devils hole."
257994,tipupesox,2008-10-13 17:22:00,167,"charlied,  I am sure you have the same type of issues on the Lake O tribs on your side of the pond.  I just don't enjoy fishing elbow to elbow with fellow fisherman that lack in ethics.  But even with that stated, the pressure on the Lake Erie tribs have increased and you are seeing some of the same unethical fishing techniques.  There are a lot of creeks to fish other than the larger flows, only problem is you don't get the large influx of fish.  The advantage is fishing the majority of the day seeing a low number of anglers, you just need to get out and investigate.  One day you may come across a gem.  I have a friend that lives right on 18 mile (Erie) in the event you ever need stream conditions.  Good fishing, Tom"
258104,charlied,2008-10-14 01:13:00,584,"i don't get out fishing much with working lots and workin on my house, so sometimes exploring is kinda hard to do...LOL.  I tried to explore last year but all the rivers were muddy and alittle high so fishing wasn't so go and last year I didn't get a NY state licence.  I live right in Fort Erie so its nothing to just hop over but its hard finding the time.  I was asking cause for a partner cause I don't like to fish over on the US tribs alone."
