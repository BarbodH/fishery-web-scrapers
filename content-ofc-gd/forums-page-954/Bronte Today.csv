257704,kemper,2008-10-12 05:05:00,2232,"Looks like its probably a resident. They get kinda 'boxy' like that, nice little fish too bad it got left for dead like that"
257797,Stern Rules,2008-10-12 18:37:00,342,"It did look fresh, Clamp It. It wasn't mushy and wasn't picked at at that point. When I came back down a seagull was picking at it. It definately wasn't there long and that was shortly after sunrise. What a waste of good fish."
