When other anglers are working small, twister tail jigs   with a vertical finesse approach, casting a swimbait can boat you plenty of   fish. This season give yourself an advantage, integrating swimbaits into your   walleye repertoire. Here's what you need to know about these productive   baits.  Eating Your Catch -   From Landing Net to Table By Justin Hoffman There's nothing more   fulfilling, both to the taste buds and the tummy, than that of freshly caught   fish. Whether they are cooked over the open flames of a campfire, pan-fried in   the kitchen, or baked on the BBQ, the tempting aromas and mouth-watering   flavours are just rewards for a hard day spent on the water. Add to that the   inherent health benefits that can be derived from regularly eating our finny   friends, and you've got yourself a true winner for the dinner   table.
