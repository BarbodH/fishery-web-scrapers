I am not sure what smallies are supposed to be doing this time of year so we started out by trolling with Rapalas (perch and a silver/black) with no success. I ended up grabbing this 3 odd pounder with the tried and true YUM dinger that has been grabbing them all summer.  Ran into a fellow OFC'er and others who all confirmed that the bite was tough. What a day though. Jim"
257678,Leecher,2008-10-12 03:13:00,7832,Great report and pic Jim  Sure was nice to be out on the water today  Thanks for sharing Leechman

Radine, this time of year tubes and drop shoting work best, colder water slower presentation, be aware of the wind as well , if it's blowing from the south fish the north sides of the reef ect. feed bag is on and there chasing the bait fish, the wind blows the bait fish around, yesterday was the bassmania tournament out there and there were bags of 25 pnds plus and a big fish of 6.40 pnds, there there you just have to find them."
