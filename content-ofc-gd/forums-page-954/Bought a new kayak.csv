257922,jediangler,2008-10-13 04:12:00,1923,"Drove 270km up to Bracebridge on Saturday to Muskoka Outfitters to buy a new kayak. Man the 400 was slow going. It took me 3.5hrs up and 2.5hrs back. Bought a Native Watercraft ultimate 12 tegris model. Man this sucker is light, 28lbs for a 12ft boat with the seat removed, 36lbs with it in.  Easy to put on the roof and didn't even notice it was up there when I was driving.   Here it is about to begin it's maiden voyage in the Grand river.  Anyone recognize this spot?  1st fish was a little smallie that hit a 1/16oz jig & grub combo in yellow.  This one hit a 1/8oz jig & grub in white. Ended up with 5 smallies, all around the same size, and one crappie. Nice day to be on the water. Saw 1 canoe and 5 kayaks in 2.5hrs. We are taking over the world people so throw away your operators cards and pick up a paddle   ."
257926,mikeymikey,2008-10-13 06:06:00,376,what pics?
257934,Greencoachdog,2008-10-13 12:08:00,8163,"Nice report and pics!!!  I've noticed that you're a master of the self-timer feature on the camera, good job!  Nice little boat too! You can't beat the MPG's on that one!!!"
257935,aplumma,2008-10-13 12:09:00,6896,very nice boat looks like just the ticket for a good falls worth of fishin  Art
257945,danbo,2008-10-13 13:35:00,2646,That's a step-up from the other boat. Fish on!
257951,Leecher,2008-10-13 14:05:00,7832,Great report and pics jediangler  Congratulation for your new boat    real nice Thanks for sharing Leechman
257952,irishfield,2008-10-13 14:07:00,26272, I'm with Mikey... seems any pics hosted on myfishingpics.com don't show for me on OFC...while everything else shows up fine.
257955,Wild,2008-10-13 14:19:00,704,I see the pics fine but would like more info on the spot.  I was also thinking that if you added some winglets to the canoe you might get better fuel economy
257956,jediangler,2008-10-13 14:20:00,1923,That is a step up danbo. I have had 4yrs of good use from my Canadian tire $279 special (they now sell for $399) but I had to find out if I was really into the sport before I invested big bucks. I've had my Sportspal canoe for 15yrs so I figured 15yrs from now I'll be 60 and I wanted something light enough that I could still roof it on the car.
257959,jediangler,2008-10-13 14:27:00,1923,Here is a link for you Wild. It has more historical info than anything but you can link on the trail map on the top left corner.  http://www.sju.ca/grt/pioneertower.htm  Kuntz park is where the tower is.
257986,fishindevil,2008-10-13 16:38:00,6254,Nice looking brand new fishing machine !!!!  and a great weekend to give her a maiden voyage !!!   nice fish as well as the pictures too !!..cheers
258002,Wild,2008-10-13 18:02:00,704,"Thanks Jedi  I will have to put this area on my places to see list, sure looks like a great area to try out the boat."
258122,tbayboy,2008-10-14 02:10:00,1497,"Nice ride Jedi, I've got serious yak envy (look out google, here I come!)"
258132,holdfast,2008-10-14 03:16:00,1813,"That looks like an awesome boat.  I have a few questions, Ive canoed a lot in the past and really don't know how heavy it is, its fiberglass.  If that is a Kayak because it sure looks close to a canoe, how sturdy/steady is it in comparison with a canoe.  How is it for trolling, do you double paddle or can you use a single paddle.  Also 39 lbs really seems light, what would a fiberglass canoe of the same size weigh just as a comparison.  bye the way nice pics, thanks"
258135,jediangler,2008-10-14 03:24:00,1923,"Well holdfast, it's considered a hybrid. Part canoe, part kayak. It is recommended to use a kayak paddle. It's made of Tegris which is used as bullet proof clothing for the military. It is less than 1/8 of an inch thick and weighs 28lbs with the seat removed. It has skirts that cover it and make it look more like a kayak but I haven't tried mine yet. Maybe tomorrow. I don't troll but you can stand up in it although I don't feel comfortable with that yet, that's how stable it is. Here is a link to a video on Youtube of a guy standing and flyfishing out of a Tegris 12.  "
258174,holdfast,2008-10-14 12:42:00,1813,"Give trolling a try also see if you can use a single paddle, rod on one side paddle on the other( no good to me if I cant troll).  A hybrid, interesting concept, let me know how it works out"
258175,silveradosheriff,2008-10-14 12:47:00,1025,Where are the riggers?  :-)
258184,joonmoon,2008-10-14 13:15:00,528,"Hey Bro, cool lookin yakoe or canak or whatever ya call it. did ya figure out a wheeled cart for this one? Yup I know the spot well, water looked clear and average level too. Gonna have to give it a shot again soon. Was there a few weeks ago and it was high and dirty only picked up one small smallie."
258194,lew,2008-10-14 13:36:00,12767,"Congrats on the new purchase jedi, I always enjoy reading about your yak adventures."
258219,b2kptbo,2008-10-14 15:09:00,1505,"Nice looking rig, should get ya in some good spots, enjoy..."
258238,skrillaguerilla,2008-10-14 16:14:00,30,what an awesome way to fish the grand! i would like to rent one and try it out when bass opens next spring!
258244,NAC,2008-10-14 16:34:00,369,"It is a great way to fish the Grand or many other waterbodies for that matter.  Just remember bass doesn't open until next summer, but it is open until end of Nov-08.  Expect lots of feedback on your new toy Jedi!"
258249,ccmtcanada,2008-10-14 17:04:00,7971,Sweet new setup!  Looking forward to more reports!  You going to mod it much?
258285,jediangler,2008-10-14 18:13:00,1923,"No Cliff, I think I'm pretty much going to leave it stock. I have to figure out a camera mount and mod my cart for the different hull design, other than that, maybe a FF for next year. Here is a link to the manufacturers website for anyone interested.  http://www.nativewatercraft.com/"
258296,snag,2008-10-14 19:00:00,1932,Sweet ride!  Definitely tweaked my interest.  Look forward to your reports.
