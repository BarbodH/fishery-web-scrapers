257860,Leecher,2008-10-12 23:56:00,7832,Great report and pics Woodsman  Looks like a fun 2 hours spent on the water.  Good job Thanks for sharing Leechman
257919,fishing,2008-10-13 03:50:00,167,"Nice pictures. Thanks for the report.  The Thames is a great place to fishing. We fished there once, caught a sheepshead. Saw other people caught a lot of silver bass. ""The carp"" is a sucker, white sucker. There are some fish pictures in the following link. http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/envision/guide/"
257928,Woodsman,2008-10-13 09:58:00,1286,I stand corrected. The colour and large scales initially confused me. Same colour & scales as the carp I caught a week ago. Mouth is different though.  Rick.
