414211,NAW,2009-12-21 18:25:00,4022,A buddy e-mailed me this earlier today.  The new “Pending” Archery Ontario moose record.  A big Soo bruiser!   http://sootoday.com/content/news/full_stor...oryNumber=43553
414212,smally21,2009-12-21 18:28:00,993,i don't know much about the moose scoring system. perhaps someone could share it with us non hunters.  what would this moose weigh in at??
414220,troutboy,2009-12-21 18:48:00,125,"I watched that youtube video of it being harvested,amazing how close they got to him!Thanks for posting!"
414221,richyb,2009-12-21 18:50:00,774,  The scoring system is the antlers.  It could be a small body but still be the world record because of its antlers. A big bull could be pushing over 1200 pounds.
414245,dickie,2009-12-21 19:55:00,64,I think he was closer to 1400 pounds
414248,Governator,2009-12-21 20:05:00,879,Sad to watch such a beautiful beast take his last breath.  (Obviously a non-hunter's perspective).
414249,NAW,2009-12-21 20:10:00,4022,"I actually just watched that video for the first time.  This is an older video.  I think it's been posted on here before.  Wups  Still a nice bull though, and a cool video."
414331,pike slayer,2009-12-22 00:50:00,1177,ya this has been posted before but nobody said anything about any record! thats sweet and sault boys to!!
414382,T Fisher,2009-12-22 03:22:00,139,"WOW.... SIMPLY AMAZING...... THAT IS A HUNTERS DREAM COME TRUE, CONGRAT'S TO THE HUNTERS ON A TROPHY OF A LIFETIME."
