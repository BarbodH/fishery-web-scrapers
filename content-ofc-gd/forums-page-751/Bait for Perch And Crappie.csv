393930,ERB,2009-10-17 19:49:00,35,Hello everyone I am getting ready for the ice fishing season. Seems like a lot of people use Gulp magots and waxies for perch and Crappie. I was just wondering what colour most people use? Also what other baits work well for you? Thanks

393937,ERB,2009-10-17 20:10:00,35, Thank you. You just put them on a small jig?
393939,johnnyb,2009-10-17 20:12:00,3413,"small jig, jigging spoon, bare hook with split shot...you can be creative.  But small jig is good.  I like micro tubes to bulk it up a bit."
393941,ERB,2009-10-17 20:12:00,35,   Cool thank you. What colour?
393944,GBW,2009-10-17 20:16:00,8460,"pink, white, red/white & yellow are what I use.  the white also glows if you charge it..."

394190,Greencoachdog,2009-10-18 23:58:00,8163,"Live minnows are my winter go to bait for Crappie!!!... but last winter some folks on here were raving about the Gulp Fish Fry, so I just recently purchased a couple of jars for this winter... I'll try them against the live minnows to see which works the best.  As far as color, if the water is really stained/dirty/muddy... pink works the best, if it's just a bit stained/dirty/muddy... then the color is yellow. if the water is clear... white is the color to go with! This holds true for jig colors and the plastic grubs/tubes that go on them.  For Crappie, pink/white can be killer... and so can chartreuse/black!.. and then there's the Electric Rooster pink/chartreuse!!!"
394237,Leecher,2009-10-19 01:33:00,7832,All good suggestions so far I use Gulp fish fry in white or chartreuse on a micro jig to get to the perch and pannies..... here is a pic    That stuff really works wonders Leechman
394242,OhioFisherman,2009-10-19 01:49:00,6623,"I don`t ice fish, I have fished for quite a long time though and for a variety of species at times, far and away the best bait I have seen for perch and crappie is emerald shiners, or they may be called lake minnows. They work any season I have fished and for a lot of different species. Just not my choice of bait for a long time as I generally fish for larger species and the lake minnows aren`t large enough to keep small fish away.  You can take the first crappie-perch you catch and scale a spot on the white belly with a pocket knife, cut a small strip of the scaled white belly meat, leave the skin on, meat will tear off easily with out it. Put it on a small jig or hook instead of a minnow.  Piece of worm will work for perch, haven`t had as much luck for crappie on live worms, but other might."

414533,ciceri,2009-12-22 18:41:00,535,"Pinhead minnows work good, and their cheap, $5 for a decent sized scoop, about 50 or more per scoop?"

I inch fish fry...1 inch minnows...minnow heads...maggots and/or waxworms...  They all look good for tipping a small Rapala jig or teardrop jig or tiny swedish pimple...or maybe on one of Dawg's sabiki rigs...  I have them all on my BPS wish list at present...can't make up my mind which..."
