414000,Twocoda,2009-12-20 23:11:00,4130,not at all Leechman...i personally hate techno music but finding it does have a purpose   feel free to add any ya want ...this stuff does make you feel something ....just not sure what the feeling is yet..
414002,splashhopper,2009-12-20 23:12:00,2931,There used to be a house in Willowdale did the same thing... he collected money for charity for it.... raised close to 10k / month and hydro gave him a credit for all the juice he used that month too

414010,Twocoda,2009-12-20 23:23:00,4130,Actually splash...a friend i used to go to school with in London ...use to add 10k lights to his house every year he had another child...i was thinking of him the other day and wondered if he was still over killing the lights ..so i typed into utube to see if his display was on there and sure enough it was ....thats how i found this Techno Stuff  here is the link for Dominics house on Saskatoon St...its made him kinda famous.....it used to be a real spectacle to see in person    Im not sure if Dominic still lives there and the new owners have kept up the tradition
