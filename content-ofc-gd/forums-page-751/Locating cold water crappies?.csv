The only problem i have with this is you can only catch fish when they move up on the flat which is only every few hours or so, sometimes only after dark also.."
413881,Beans,2009-12-20 15:41:00,3339,I'm thinking fish deep in the daylight and fish shallower in the early morning and late afternoons...

413903,Terry,2009-12-20 17:23:00,14456,"I like to find them on flats and weeds myself,  when they are there they are there to eat... but who knows where they will be in the kawartha lakes"
413996,FisherMike,2009-12-20 23:05:00,108,"i often find them right in tight to structure.  fallen trees are good spots.  if ice fishing and I see some branches exposed above the ice, I will often drill holes right in the thick of it.  ive been lucky a few times and pulled lots of fish from a single fallen tree, and then when it slows down i will look for another tree."
