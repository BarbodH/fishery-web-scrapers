Is there a chance that the engraver could wreck the reel?  Any tips I can pass on to the engraver to ensure this doesn't happen?  Anybody in the Barrie area that you would recommend?   Thanks for taking the time."
413933,irishfield,2009-12-20 19:26:00,26272,If it's anodized.. the engraving will be into bare aluminum and a POSSIBLE place for corrosion to start... but if kept clean and wiped down shouldnt' be an issue.

413978,Twocoda,2009-12-20 22:22:00,4130,Ill PM you my name so the engraver doesnt mess it up   seriously it shouldnt be a problem but if there is a concern of anodization you can always put a light clear coat of fingernail polish on it to seal but i dont think it is necessary  Someones going to be lucky Christmas morn ...i too bought my son a new float reel for Christmas and was considering engraving it...decided against it
