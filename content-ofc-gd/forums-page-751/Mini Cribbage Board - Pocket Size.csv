413741,Leecher,2009-12-20 02:16:00,7832,Here's what I've been doing today while waiting for the ice to thicken Managed to create the smallest cribbage board to date...... here is how I created it:  First got a few pieces of pine of same thinkness......    Glued them together.....      Cut the pieces to my likings and got the template done and a couple of coat of white....    Once done.... Got a a couple of coats of bright orange applied..... Dried fitted the template and applied tape to hold it in place.  Started to punch the holes for the outline of the game and drilled all the holes....    Since this piece was so small.... didn't have much choice but to keep the same spacing in between holes and had to mark them....    Finished adding the letraset      The underside....    After a couple of coats of varnish    To give you perpective      Hope you enjoy Leechman
