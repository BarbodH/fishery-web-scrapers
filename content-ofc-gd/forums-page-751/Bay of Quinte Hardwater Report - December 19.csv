413654,Jeff_C,2009-12-19 22:54:00,50,"We scouted yesterday morning checking out various areas of the Bay of Quinte that had safe enough ice to venture out on.  Most areas that we checked were not quite there yet with only 1 to 2 inches.  We found a place that had more and we figured that there should be fish there, but didn't have time to actually drop a line.  Today we headed out at first light on the hunt.  We were on 4.5 to 5"" of hard black ice.  Within a few minutes we began to mark some fish but we had to figure them out as they were not aggressive.  It didn't take too long to crack the code and we started chipping away at them.  They were short biting and stealing a lot of minnows.  A few fish were lost and one break off, but we ended up with a successful morning and were off the ice around 10:00am.  Here are a few pictures from the morning.  Jeff              "
