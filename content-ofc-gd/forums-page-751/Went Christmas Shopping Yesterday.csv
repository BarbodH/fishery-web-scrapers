414510,Leecher,2009-12-22 17:17:00,7832,I hear the little Foxee's are great lures You should be good for a while with all these
414513,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-22 17:36:00,10439,"  I've done well with the mid sized ones and the larger Badd Boyz jigs. I didn't even know that the lil foxee's came in a giant size, they should work great for our big lakers."
414515,Leecher,2009-12-22 17:44:00,7832," The mid size is what we use for whities down here.... Tell me Dave, have you done any ice fishing lately??"
414527,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-22 18:23:00,10439,"I haven't been able to get out yet this winter (too much OT at work   ) Right now I'm at the parents house in Belwood   when I should be home making swiss cheese of all the lakes. The forcast for the 2 weeks I'm here is beautiful back in Yellowknife, then it turns to crap as soon as I get home!!! Two weeks ago we had highs of -49C and just as it warms up into the high teens to -25 I have to hop on a plane and leave.  The one bright spot will be the few days of winter steelheading I get to do.   That and filling up on stuff I can't get back home like the odd lure or two."
