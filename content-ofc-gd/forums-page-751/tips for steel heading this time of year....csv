I was hoping to get some advice in terms of what to use and techniques... thanks in advance for the help!  derrick

You may be better off shooting over to the huron side. The saugeen is big and fast enough that there should be fishable water from the dam down to the graveyard. The sauble may be an option as well, it takes longer to freeze. If you're using roe try hot pink. For whatever reason in ice water the bright colour seems to ilicit hits. Jigs tipped with maggots or waxworms would be a good choice as well. Good luck."
