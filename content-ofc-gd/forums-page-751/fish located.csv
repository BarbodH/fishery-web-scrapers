413701,Twocoda,2009-12-20 00:31:00,4130,yep
413706,fishinguypat,2009-12-20 01:06:00,547,anyone else have a better answer?
413712,irishfield,2009-12-20 01:17:00,26272,How about get off the couch and find out for yourself for once... and report back so another couch potato can get out based on your advise!
413750,fishinguypat,2009-12-20 02:44:00,547,no... i'm just sayin is it iced over?
413757,GoneFishin,2009-12-20 03:07:00,349,"There's ice, not sure about the fish though.. Got out this morning but no luck. Only 3 inches of ice where I was."
413768,irishfield,2009-12-20 03:34:00,26272,Goderich looked pretty open on Thursday... . but there's a group of PEng's from Denver that are looking for new employment !! 
413773,fishinguypat,2009-12-20 03:55:00,547,do you think i should try the harbours?
413968,fishinguypat,2009-12-20 21:32:00,547,yeah i went and didn't catch anything because of the bad conditions. do any of you guys ice fish in the harbour?
414035,Twocoda,2009-12-21 00:24:00,4130,nope
414089,NAC,2009-12-21 03:27:00,369,"  Wow, they sure put a lot of time into that to see it in that mess now."
414094,irishfield,2009-12-21 03:42:00,26272,Luckily it happened at 3 in the morning.. and not when 30 men were working inside it earlier in the day on Wednesday. The underground crew thought there was an earthquake !
