413788,Weeds,2009-12-20 05:08:00,782,"Howdy all, I'm heading down to Mexico in a few days and figured for a change I might actually try to do a little fishing while on familly vacation. Nothing fancy, nothing expensive and definately no guides or charters. I'll throw the nigh invulnerable two piece Ugly Stik in the suitcase, the Daiwa Exceler spooled with 14 to 20 pound Vanish (hey, it works for me) , a pack of Senkos and two white Spinnerbaits. If I get the opportunity I figure I might take a few casts here and there, kind of like I might at home. Anyone got any advice? Are Bass there plentiful and gigantic or few and far between? Any clue as to regulations  or if there even are any regarding licences?"
413795,Sinker,2009-12-20 05:50:00,8692,I'm pretty sure you need a guide to fish down there. I did where I was anyways. We were on the mayan riviera.  S.

He didn't speak any English and I speak little Spanish so we didn't communicate well but he was using red/maroon plastic minnows on a weighted jig. He did tell me me he'd caught a couple of fish about 18-20"" long.  Where are you going? I'll be in Cancun on the second of Jan.  JF"
