414307,misfish,2009-12-21 23:57:00,29133,"I have had this goalie stick now, for almost 20+ years. I have shown it to a few older fellas at work,one being a goalie from the 60,s.He said that Johnny Bower used the same brand when he played.  Can anyone date this stick and give me a value on it?  The stick is still in mint shape.No seperating of the blade.      Made in Canada    Thanks"
414310,Twocoda,2009-12-22 00:03:00,4130,oh man... can i remeber that stick...HEAVY with about ten pounds of resin on it ...mid/late 70s i would think is when i used one very similar to that  if you do find a savvy hockey collector let me know ...i have something very rare
414316,misfish,2009-12-22 00:11:00,29133,This stick is not heavy at all.I was also told it dated back earllier then that.
414317,irishfield,2009-12-22 00:11:00,26272,Maple... At $300 a bush cord....probably about $5 for the fireplace! lol  Sorry bud... can't help ya. A rare item these days.....
414319,Leecher,2009-12-22 00:21:00,7832,If I was you B..... I'd make a nice tipup with it  wink wink  or a cribbage board   Joke / joke  Sorry can't help you with how much this one is worth J
414325,fishforfun,2009-12-22 00:31:00,105,Johnny Bower Brian. The stick is definately old I would agree with 60's vintage but value would be based on history as much as age ie who did it belong to?
414328,misfish,2009-12-22 00:40:00,29133,"No history that I know of.  I was, like told,the same brand of stick, was used by Johnny.  Thank for the correction on the spelling."
414337,fishforfun,2009-12-22 01:00:00,105,"Baurer Bower both were big names in the game. Well it's a classic goal stick, personally it would have a spot of honour above my beer fridge   Other than that don't know how you would value it but someone may."
414344,misfish,2009-12-22 01:22:00,29133,"  Thats where it has been.  The only other wooden Canadian made stick, I have ever owned and used, was a Wally. It was made in Newhamberg Ont.Where I played in my younger days. If you wanted a heavy (deffencemen chopping stick),that would be the one.Not sure they even exsit anymore."
414353,walleyejigger,2009-12-22 02:02:00,876,"give that stick to a kid these days and he'd break his arm with the weight of it   sorry cant help you with what it would be worth, the shaft would make some good tip ups."
414357,Fishn Technishn,2009-12-22 02:22:00,198,"WOW! Johnny Bower was a BIG HERO in London when I was a kid. I have a ltd edition print of his, hangin in the family room!  I remember Wally sticks!! My 1st ""curved"" stick was a Wally! My dad wouldn't let me  use a Wally Warp until I scored 3 goals in 1 game. Took some trying but I finally got it. My dad took me to the store that day!! Not sure who was more proud....me or dad!!  I had to use a Green Flash up until that day....now that was HEAVY!!  Good luck on the value of that old ""AXE"" , lol,  it is a real BEAUT!!  FT"
414366,Rob,2009-12-22 02:54:00,467, I bet it belonged to Brian's dad who then used it on Brian when he was MIS Behavin!!  :P  Rob
414368,T Fisher,2009-12-22 02:57:00,139,"Hockey related what's it worth.  A 1967 stanley cup champions Toronto Maple Leafs hockey stick signed by every player, coach and all other staff that were on the 1967 leafs.  WHAT'S IT WORTH ???????"
414374,irishfield,2009-12-22 03:05:00,26272,Looks like $599 retail T Fisher.. guy on Craiglist wants a $1000...
414415,John,2009-12-22 12:53:00,2956," Hey Wayne, I'll take a couple of bush cords delivered to Burlington......"
414490,jediangler,2009-12-22 15:41:00,1923,Track Johnny Bower down and get him to sign it. Then put it on ebay and you might get something.
414516,uglyfish,2009-12-22 17:50:00,981,"its not worth much... its just a stick like any other my friend. if it was signed, or had been used by someone famous, that would be a different story.  its value would be more of a sentimental sort, had it been passed  along in the family, or was given by a parent or grandparent. its more of a keepsake now. i have an OLD player stick that i got from my grandpa many years ago, solid 1 piece stick. once i have a place that i can properly decorate, it will have a place on my wall.  so, again, sorry to be the one to break it to ya, but as for value, not much at all. a collector someplace might pay a few bucks to add to his collection, but ur better off keeping it, and proudly displaying a classic piece of our game above the fireplace."
414524,Terry,2009-12-22 18:15:00,14456,maybe this will help   
414531,Rob,2009-12-22 18:33:00,467,Looks like a million bucks Terry!! Brian's buying everyone beer and wings tonight  Rob C
414559,misfish,2009-12-22 20:21:00,29133," I had no intentions of selling it.I was curious.  Thanks for the reply.   If you ask my pop Rob,he,ll tell ya it never fazed on me one bit."
414568,camillj,2009-12-22 20:49:00,1988,Johnny does a LOT of charity events these days .. he'll most likely be glad to sign it for you he's a real gentleman ! ... then in another 20 years it really WILL be worth something .. especially if you get a picture of him signing it with you in the picture (I did that with a leafs jersey)
