The walleye bite compared to last year was not as good for size and not as numerous, but managed at least two or three fish per short outing. Mixed in with those walleye were some other species which were great to catch as well.      Got out for my first ice fishing trip for the 09/10 season for a couple of hours this afternoon.  The bite was very good and managed to land 18 walleye/sauger.  Kept a few for the dinner table.  The largest fish of the afternoon was a 20"" walleye and the ice was around 5"" in depth.  Hopefully the fishing will stay consistent for a while longer.  "
