413907,redneck666,2009-12-20 17:35:00,563,im new to ice fishing. this will be my first season. im a 220-225lb guy. what thickness ice of should there be for my size? and how long into the season should i wait before i set foot on the ice? AND is there anyone on this board that fishes lake george during hard water? if so are there any decent/good spots for perch and walleye?
413962,Leecher,2009-12-20 21:16:00,7832,"6"" of black ice should do..... if you feel uncertain about it.... don't even step onto it.  Mid January is usually safe to walk on.  As for your lake question.... sorry can't help you with that one. Leechman"
413966,GBW,2009-12-20 21:25:00,8460,"also, make sure you have a float suite.  rather be safe then...."
413967,Paully,2009-12-20 21:25:00,712,From what i gather 4 - 6 inches is good for 200lbs and up....
413997,icedude,2009-12-20 23:05:00,459,would agree--TMI-weigh in at a not so   Kewl 200 lbs--the sled is -500 pounds  do the math  if you like that puddle jumping stufF --Ravine Rat--where are you when i need you--would recommend you put the boots to it--NEVER S-L-O-W down    Merry Christmas PHOTOZ  Trust the mail this Christmas did not do you in  Paul
414088,redneck666,2009-12-21 03:27:00,563, thanks for the post. but i havent even got the slightest clue as to what you wrote haha.
414090,redneck666,2009-12-21 03:29:00,563, thanks for the help. im usually a pretty brave soul. but im a little more catious on ice cause i fell through a number of times. still dont have a floater suit though. might be a good idea to invest in one cause of all my bad luck haha!
414096,icedude,2009-12-21 03:46:00,459,hahaha--sorry BRN- was a trifle cryptic---lol----you're as safe as mothers milk on 4-6 inches of ice--at 225 pounds --walking one assumes    --let us know how you make out!    dress safely--Have FUN  Merry Christmas
414115,redneck666,2009-12-21 06:46:00,563,well i wont be out for a bit yet. im waiting for huts/other fisherman to start appearig on leigh's bay in the st. mary's river. then wait for reports to come in about the ice at my new found favorite lake.
