Are they planning on incorporating the side scan technologyinto the the HDS series main body insteaa\d of having it as seperate module?  looking to upgrade next year and dont want to buy "" the year before""  Thanks  darren"
412667,Gman,2009-12-17 01:40:00,126,I'm not entirely sure however I am confident Jocelyn at Angling Outfitters in Woodstock can give you the details.  He's doing all the electronics on my new ride including the Lowrance side imaging which includes the down scan.  Cheers G.
412681,Terry,2009-12-17 01:57:00,14456,"it is my understanding that the side scan will always be an add-on  but the Broadband Sounder started as an add-on too, so who knows"

414138,Gman,2009-12-21 13:44:00,126,"If you're looking at the side imaging and structure scan you will require the LSS-1 module and LSS-1 transducer.  From talking with several people much closer than I they don't believe there are any plans to incorporate the technology in to the head unit as it will only increase the price while not everyone is interested in paying for the technology.  Hope this helps.  Cheers, G."
