The holiday's are a great time to remember what life is all about - family and friends. Thank you all for being friends and thanks for your support all year long.  Oh ya another thing Christmas is about is gifts lol! So here's what I want. We will have some cool things happening on our You Tube Channel in the next few weeks. but we need as may subscribers as possible to make it happen.  So if you can please subscribe it's free and you will really like what we have coming out there. However I need you guys to subscribe to make this happen.  Once again Merry Christmas and I hope to see you all in the new year.  Here's the link to our YouTube channel. http://www.youtube.com/user/factsoffishing  "
