Only thing different done to the day before was since i had a buddy with me we drilled a few more holes out to the deeper water...the ice is good all the way across now...averaging around 8-9"".  I got one small sauger on a jiggin' rap in the deep water....then we slowly moved our way back top the shallows for the evening bite, jigging pre-drilled holes along the way, with no takers.  the bite came on from aabout 3-4pm then just turned off like someone had flicked a switch.  The most productive hole the day before yesterday was again the 'honey hole', and not being a gentleman i took that hole for myself....lol.  In fact all the fish except the one sauger and one that got off for Paul...which would have been the biggest fish (always the way) came out of that hole again.  Paul did not get a fish unfortunately ...but he got a walleye supper chez Limey's last night so he cant complain.....lol.   EAGLE LAKE PART II  "
413884,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-20 15:52:00,2582," Funny how that is sometimes. I have been out with a group of 3-4 others...many times...and 80% of the fish come out of that one honey hole. Doesn't matter who is fishing it, or what they are using.  Thx again for the report Simon. My perch spot still isn't good to go yet...so I slept in  ....Next weekend for sure though."
