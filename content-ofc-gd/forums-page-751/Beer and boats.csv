414284,lew,2009-12-21 22:27:00,12766,"Back in the day it was very common to have a beer or 2 while you were out fishing and nobody really ever gave it a second thought, but I spose things have changed alot over the years.  Myself & 2 buds were heading out from the trailer park one afternoon about 25 years ago for a few hours of fishing and threw 6 beers in the icebox just like we always did. As we were motoring down the lake...I was driving....we got stopped by the police boat. He gave the boat the usual check for safety gear, then asked me what was in the icebox. I said we've got 6 beers for the fishing trip and he said ""thank you sir,  have a great day  and good luck fishing""  Everybody was sober, polite & friendly and the coppers weren't the least bit concerned.  About 10 years ago 2 friends of mine were out fishing the same lake and got stopped by the police. The friend driving the boat was drinking a bottle of water but his brother had a beer in the cooler that he hadn't opened yet. He had to dump the beer in the lake and was given a $150 fine.  Just similar incidents with different outcomes."

413569,mikemicropterus,2009-12-19 17:32:00,22,"Interesting fact  60% of all fatalities on the water are alcohol related and these fatalities were from falling overboard while URINATING THEIR LAST ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE!!!!  So guys drink up if you want to risk becoming a marshmellow, thats what the rescue people call you after you have been submerged for a few week or so. Hopefully you would pop up to the surface after a day or so from bloating but if it's too deep and real cold water you will not be found possibly, all for a BEER. Hardly seems worth it if you have a wife and kids to come back to.  Why not get a really fast boat and get your thrills from that, I know that a 20 minute run at 70 plus mph in my boat is better than any drink I ever had.  And speaking of governments that want to treat you like a child, thats what was elected, a legislating liberal agenda meant to label everyone a possible tax cash cow throuygh fines levies and user fees. At least the conservatives let you die first before they introduced legislation to limit each persons personal freedom. I'm OK if you personal freedoms don't infringe on mine."

413579,Fishnwire,2009-12-19 18:11:00,983, I wonder what percentage of fatalities on the water are a result of excessive speeds.  I'd feel safer on a body of water full of drunken canoeists than I would if there was one sober guy out there in a speedboat flying around doing 70.
413582,Cookslav,2009-12-19 18:20:00,1457,  Ain't that the truth...
413583,mikemicropterus,2009-12-19 18:27:00,22," Less than 10% and I was wrong as to the percentage falling overboard it's closer to 75% and 40% of the fatalities invloved alcohol, so there are more drunks out there than we know.  And to say I'd rather see a a bunch of drunks out canoeing than a controlled boat going fast driven by an experienced SOBER driver scares me.   It's a bass boat just to get the record straight and you'd look good out there surrounded by all those drunken canoeists but you'd probably be spending more of your time pulling them from the water than actually enjoying yourself on the water.   Have you ever tried to piss from a canoe when your intoxicated. The water looks awfully deep and cold.   You missed my point obviously"
413685,Cookslav,2009-12-19 23:41:00,1457,"Just for the record... There are a lotta points being missed LOL.... (Lots folks are passionate about this one I see)  The thread I started refered to ""a"" Beer in a non motorized boat...not being smashed drunk in a canoe, and trying to pee Thats something different all together, but point taken."
413850,marine5068,2009-12-20 14:53:00,26,"I watched the Canadian Cops show once last year on TV and the OPP were catching everyone in canoes that came around a bend on The Grand River near London Ontario. They took ALL the alcohol, including the unopened ones and dumped it on the ground. One woman started to argue with a cop and say that they were unopened and why would they be pricks like that. That's when the female officer told her that she could also strip search her if she thought she was under the influence of other substances. It was fun to see actually. The guys were WAY more level headed then the mouthy girls. You girls need to smarten up when you're out drunk in public. Too mouthy sometimes. They all got warnings on public drunkenness but also large fines for open liquor in public. That's the law."
413946,yakpiker,2009-12-20 20:25:00,160,I almost died in a paddleboat a couple of summers ago.  They are very tippy with only one person...especially when your drunk buddy sitting on the dock decides to grab a corner.  Darn thing flipped over and landed on my head...knocked me cold and gashed me for a dozen stitches.  I still remember sinking to the bottom before my friends pulled me out.  Sit on top kayaks are much more stable...especially when no beer is in play.
414001,ctranter,2009-12-20 23:12:00,543,"I have had the privilege of having the only cottage on a small-med lake near parry sound for my entire life.  Even since slightly before being of legal drinking age, I have enjoyed various quantities of beer out on the water.  Legalities are the last thing I'm thinking about while fishing and drinking, but safety is always a concern.  I never drink to the point where I put myself or others at risk by driving the boat into a rock or something.  The best part is, if officials ever decided to randomly search this needle in a haystack, I could be back on my dock before they parked their truck by the launch.  Id love to share the location of the lake with yall, since its the best smallmouth fishing Ive ever seen, it wouldn't be in my best interest"

414219,Cookslav,2009-12-21 18:48:00,1457," Unless your willing to pay $110 fine and dump your beer out ""if"" caught of course.

Its not legal, but then again neither is J walking....  You'll get a fine, but your not going to loose you licence, have your insurance sky rocket, or spend time in jail. A beer in a canoe may end up costing you $110 though...thats an expensive brew I tell ya"

414274,Woodsman,2009-12-21 21:47:00,1286,"I have a hard time with your statement ""If and when I am caught and fined I will stop going to Ontario""  that your basing your decision to continue to come to our province on not being able to break our laws without consequences. My guess with an attitude like that you would most likely skip out the province without paying the fine also. If you knowingly break a law you should be at least ready to pay the piper if caught and fined & not blame anyone but yourself."
412851,bigfish1965,2009-12-17 15:31:00,3382," Rented cottages and such qualify as residences by law. It is where you are living. Why would a rented ice cabin be different? And Dara...really? Laws have never been aimed at those who are responsible. Unfortunately too few of us are. Again, you live where you can go on a lake and not see a boat all day, but where most people live the lakes are as busy as a highway and you'd better have your wits about you or trouble is soon to follow."
412855,cram,2009-12-17 15:38:00,1733,"I wish the laws here were based on a foundation of self-reliance.  If i'm doing somethign that puts others at risk, then by all means i should be restricted from doing that.  I don't need laws that keep me from doing somethign to myself.  If i'm having a beer in a canoe, i don't see who i am harming."
412857,bigfish1965,2009-12-17 15:43:00,3382, The people who try to rescue you if you get stupid drunk and tip.... There are as many fatalities in unpowered boats than powered boats.
412871,smally21,2009-12-17 16:08:00,993,"  unfortunately rick is right on here.  while you should be allowed to do stupid things (say base jumping for example) we live in a place where all efforts are made to rescue/recover the 'daring' among us.  so that dude had every right to jump off the escarpment with a parachute in his hand.  however he didn't have the right to endanger the emergency personnel who had a duty to remove him from the side of the cliff he mangled himself on.  so we have laws (lots of them!) to prohibit these actions.  maybe a bad example but the idea is the same.  and by the way i don't see the harm in having a cold one in your canoe!  empties, i beleive, are construed as refuse not alcohol."
412881,Hud,2009-12-17 16:32:00,140,  kind of what I thought but hey was the one with the badge and gun  lol
412888,Weeds,2009-12-17 16:47:00,782,  If one or two beers gets you stupid drunk you probably should not be drinking anywhere. One or two beers don't tip canoes.
412896,JohnF,2009-12-17 17:17:00,3494," It's the thin edge of the wedge. Most restrictive laws (and which ones aren't to most folks?) originate out of the inability of a few to exercise proper judgment and self control. The majority therefore are assumed to subscribe to the same standard of irresponsibility. If the enforcement of laws was predicated on the individual's self assessed standards of responsibility there'd be no need for the laws.  Do you know anyone who doesn't think ""I'm perfect, but I'm just not so sure about you.""  JF"
412898,cram,2009-12-17 17:20:00,1733," Rick - you think its appropriate that because some guy gets ""stupid drunk"" somewhere and kills himself i can't have 2 beers in my canoe when i go for a an afternoon paddle and hike?  I would much prefer a little flavour of self reliance in our laws.  Why should we govern society down to the lowest common denominator?   Govern and restrict the ""majority"" of us as though we are the few dumb and really reckless people in the minority?  That is one aspect i like about the US.   Hurt someone, you are incredibly liable, but you're not governed like a daycare facility.  One day we'll all have to wear safety helmets to walk down the sidewalk."
412903,JohnF,2009-12-17 17:41:00,3494," Unfortunately applying the ""lowest common denominator"" rule is about all that works. I'll use myself as an example. I believe I'm an above average driver. I've had one accident in almost 50 years of driving and it was nowhere close to being my fault. A semi crossed the median and took out 11 cars on the 401 in a snowstorm. I'm not a lane jumper. I maintain my vehicles mechanically to the highest practical standard with good tires etc. I consider the road and weather conditions and try to never drive beyond my abilities to react to situations within my control. I have a bit of racing experience. I never drive if I've been drinking at all. But I always liked to drive fast so it would be nice if I could explain to the cop who stops me that for all those reasons I should be exempt from silly restrictive speed laws. And of course if I get away with it because I'm such a credible soul, then the guy who thinks he's an excellent fdriver with only a few lite beers under his belt has a similar argument for why he should be exempt, and his buddy who says he can hold his liquor even better is right in claiming that he's perfectly in control with 3 or 4 lite beers in him, etc etc. Ultimately we get to the guy who says he can guzzle a quart of scotch and still see to drive asking why he should be restricted.  Drivers and drinkers are really just like a union. Everything is geared to the lowest common denominator. The responsible folks suffer for the stupidity, laziness, irresponsibility or whatever of the lowest of the order.  Imagine if there were no drinking and/or driving laws. Our world would be an exciting place. Sometimes laws are an inconvenience but think about all the laws that make your life safer or more comfortable.  JF"
412914,cram,2009-12-17 18:09:00,1733," Like i said, John -- if you're doing something that endangers others than i *get* putting restrictions on the lowest common denominator.  Speeding, aggressive driving, or drinking and driving endanger others.  Me having 2 beers in my canoe is in no way endangering anyone.  In fact, if i have 3 beers in my canoe i am likely DUI....so as far as the law is concerned i am a bigger hazard to society than the guy driving down a 50km/hr road at 98km/hr.  Think about THAT for a minute."
412918,Fish4Eyes,2009-12-17 18:18:00,1022,"If you really need the beer that bad, then drink it before heading out. Beer is not crack, you do not hurt and feel pain if you don't have it. Dependent on who you ask I suppose"

412933,basketclam,2009-12-17 19:07:00,115,"The long and the short of it is that you either have to be at a residence or a licensed estabilishment to drink booze.  If you're camping, your campsite is considered a residence.  If you're on a boat that's not moving (anchored), and it has facilities, it can be considered a residence.  Your run of the mill canoe isn't a residence."
412941,cram,2009-12-17 19:16:00,1733,  Which means having a beer in your canoe is illegal.....which to me is crazy

As far as your canoe, you are sitting in the #1 killer as far as vessels on the water and the #1 reason is booze so your going to be charged with something.  Get a paddle boat, nobody has died using a paddle boat yet."

412966,Muskieman,2009-12-17 20:51:00,2472,Well....  In 2000 I was in a paddleboat that had a built-in cooler{ full of Molson EX & Smirnoff Ice}... sunshade.. stereo and rodholders... My buddy and I paddled all over Nipissing's Cache Bay with it.   By the time we made it to the mouth of the Veuve River we were going in circles...PLASTERED!!!  We were using weeds as bait our shorts as facilities and looked like Lobsters..  And out of nowhere the OPP!!  They told us that they were 20 yards away all along for the past 10 minutes laughing at us. We had the lifejackets and the whole shebang ... we even kept the empties and were good boys and didn't pollute the lake.  Charges were: Public Intoxication  65$ If I remember correctly.. We were not put under arrest our Booze was not confiscated and we were allowed to leave VIA paddleboat so long as we didn't drive when we got to shore.   But on the other hand.............  After camping on an Island on Gull Lake hwy 805 60 miles from nowhere.... My buddy came ashore sober after spending a night on an Island with his wife. The alcohol he had brought with him for the week was In the bow of the boat  a half full 60oz of rye.  The OPP made him pour it over the firepit and proceeded to charge him with open alcohol...110.00$ 60 miles in the bush...It was 7:00 in the morning ...go figure..   I guess you never know.  RFS 
412978,aplumma,2009-12-17 21:28:00,6896,Here in the States you need a boat with a head /kitchen and berth. The Boat is anchored also. I have had many people on board and I ask them to use a coolie cover and not to flaunt that it is a beer. I as the captain do not drink alcohol while on the water period because even one beer in fact even one USA beer is enough to slow your judgment in a critical time sensitive decision. Yes even if it is a canoe you can cause a situation to become more severe than it would be before even one USA beer.   Art
412982,splashhopper,2009-12-17 21:47:00,2931,One day we'll all have to wear safety helmets to walk down the sidewalk.    and what's wrong with that ?  When I was drinking like a fiend.... a helmet would have come in real handy
413103,basketclam,2009-12-18 02:59:00,115,  I'll second that.  I'm sure more than a few of us are guilty of needing helmets once or twice in our lives.
413106,Dara,2009-12-18 03:16:00,3052," Rick, I'm not saying get sloshed and test the law. I'm saying you are renting basically a cabin on the lake for the night and you are allowed to have a beer or 2. Getting drunk and going around the lake is drunk out of residence, and not what I am recomending. Even up here if we leave our camp site and go fishing we will be charged if caught.  As said above, you can't just anchor and drink, residence means living there and that means at least for the night. If you are packed up the next day and leaving it is no longer a residence. And if you have a 14' boat and a tent on shore a shovel is your facilities.    But it is the law. it is drinking out of residence and if you pre drink and are drunk when you go out then its drunk in public.   Pick your times to drink. Alcohol isn't a requirement for fun.  And generally a cop will consider the circumstances and act acordingly.  I have pulled plenty of crap in my day and not been busted for anything yet."
413107,Cookslav,2009-12-18 03:18:00,1457,"Truth be told... A beer in the canoe/paddle boat won't harm a soul(unless of course you get fined $110 for a drink in a non residence) A dozen in the wrong situation might though.  Caution, moderation, and common sence is the key.  My query was pretty specific, and I recieved an answer I'm comfy with. A beer in at anchor in a non motorized watercraft is not legal, allthough its not going to cost me my licence either Cheers,"
412688,Cookslav,2009-12-17 02:11:00,1457,"Curiosity has the best of me and perhaps this topic has been done before but for myself this is a bit hazy... Maybe there are others who would like to know as well?  I could be wrong but, Can I not drink a beer, while not under power, and at anchor? If I'm not driving, not over the limit, not under power or mobile. Especially in say a canoe or non motorized water craft? Or a water craft with only an electric motor....is this grounds for DUI?  I'm not talking about getting crap faced and operating a boat I'm saying one beer, while at anchor in a non motorized boat.  If this is indeed illegal how do the rental house boats get away with being allowed to drink while at anchor? Or any boat parked in a Marina, or anchored in a back bay some were  Just curious how that works?"
412691,BillM,2009-12-17 02:13:00,17367,
412693,muskymatt,2009-12-17 02:15:00,2608,In Ontario youmust have a head and a galley and you must be anchored. No person is permitted to consume alcohol while the boat is in motion. Then once you have pulled up anchor and continue on your way the captain can not be over the limit.  Quebec is totally different.
412694,irishfield,2009-12-17 02:16:00,26272,It's called liquor other than residence.. and a charge that has existed as long as I've been alive. You cannot drink alchol anywhere (in Ontario) but in a place that is considered a residence.. or space you are renting like a camp site in a PPark... or campsite on the lake etc. If you are transporting the alcohol anywhere other than directly from one residence to another (and can prove it like cottage to home) you better have a full case count while underway. Houseboats and full head crusiers get away with it because the have FULL living facilities.  Now if you are in the USA.. different story depending on state/county etc. I've sat on the steps of the Capital building in DC and drank a beer. Under age.. but ..
412695,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-17 02:18:00,0,In NY you can drink and boat all day long............  Not sure why that is but it is...

412699,Cookslav,2009-12-17 02:25:00,1457," That makes sence, but I'm talking a Canoe, Paddle boat, plastic non motorized punt. Not sure if that clasifies as ""pleasure craft""....I don't beleive you need your Pleasure craft Licence to drive any of the above right?   Makes total sence wayne, But could you be nailed for DUI is what I'm wondering? heck I've had a beer in a canoe in the park a few time... I know its a faux pas for some, and camp tradition for others right? I could easily see a fine, for drinking in Public for sure or some other similar fine, but a $150 fine beats the heck outta a lost license right?"
412701,irishfield,2009-12-17 02:27:00,26272,"  The new law states impared operation of a VESSEL. They can take that right down to being on a floating chair if they really want to, to ruin your day."
412704,Fishnwire,2009-12-17 02:31:00,983," My brother-in-law from Texas pulled a can of beer from his carry on and cracked it at the Toronto airport after they touched down.  He couldn't understand why my sister freaked out.  When told he couldn't drink in the car he just kept saying, ""But I ain't drivin'!"".  He told me back home you can have a passenger passed out with an open bottle in his hand and a backseat full of empties, and as long as you don't blow over you're good to go."
412705,Cookslav,2009-12-17 02:32:00,1457,"Ah...  I feel like a lush continuing the thread but I seriously want to know LOL...  So what if the person is not Impared? One drink, in a non motorized, non pleasure craft, at anchor, not under way....perhaps in a floating chair"
412706,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-17 02:32:00,0, Water on the water...canadian beer on the pier.....
412708,irishfield,2009-12-17 02:35:00,26272, Just the liquor other than residence fine.... but if you blow over .05 your floating chair will be impounded and you have to swim home ! lol
412709,Cookslav,2009-12-17 02:37:00,1457,
412710,Fishnwire,2009-12-17 02:39:00,983,"  I think you could be charged, but under the circumstances you are descibing, the cop would have to be a real prick to give you anything more than a warning and ask you to take it to the porch.  You never know though."
412711,Dara,2009-12-17 02:41:00,3052,  Because in the US you are considered an adult. in Canada the government wants to be your mama
412725,kickingfrog,2009-12-17 03:33:00,8333, Then by all means move 3 miles south and become one.
412727,Dara,2009-12-17 03:37:00,3052,  1 mile...and i visit there lots..but there is enough better here to keep me here
412791,Whopper,2009-12-17 12:27:00,2174," This is exactly the way it was explained to me, absolutely no open containers period unless you can comply with the full living facilities    You would be hard pressed to get away with that now Wayne A lot has changed since you were a kid"
412802,Hud,2009-12-17 12:57:00,140,"I rented an ice hut on the Bog last winter for the weekend.   I had beds, stove, etc and there was an outhouse not 25 meters from the hut.  I was told by OPP that I couldn't drink.  I found that interesting.  Lucky for me they showed up in the morning when all I had to show was empties."
412804,azebra,2009-12-17 13:06:00,168,"if your not on some popular lake, some small up north  lake, just nurse your darn beer! keep it low.. and dont get drunk cuz it your own life.. funny tho i remember 15 years ago+ my uncle and dad used to drink and boat all the time up north,, I guess times have changed.."
412820,solopaddler,2009-12-17 14:14:00,8605," Yes, yes it is."
412823,Dara,2009-12-17 14:22:00,3052,"  He was lying to you. Its your residence so you can drink there. You could have a tent and a pee pot, as long as you are spending the night you can drink."
412834,blaque,2009-12-17 14:50:00,2419," I wouldnt listen to a whole lot this guy has to say after hearing this. I got a buddy like this. Before he gets all revved up and his stories start to snowball and get out of control, I stop him and say....""DUDE, dont be that guy..... Start over and tell us what really happened"""
412842,Fisherman,2009-12-17 15:16:00,7201,"You had better get a legal interpretation of residence, rented ice huts are NOT. Maybe ""up north"" things are done different, but the rules are still the same.  Look under the LLA."
412849,smally21,2009-12-17 15:26:00,993,"it is interesting how often i have this discussion with boaters and fisherman.  put the liquor licence act into the search engine and read the section regarding watercraft.  it is prohibited to convey alcohol on a boat with the following two exceptions, blah blah blah.  print it off and laminate and keep it in your boat so when some OPP dude gives you his interpretation you can discuss the real thing. perhaps not by coincidence, i haven't been too popular with the officers that stopped me.  the answers are out there, why not go to the source to know for sure!"
