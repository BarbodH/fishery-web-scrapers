We purchased ""Hooked! Again"" for the wii and it is the worst game ever!!!!  If you are thinking of buying a child or a ""big kid"" this gift for christmas....just save everyone a headache and the 59$ plus tax. Get them some fishing gear or a gift card to their favorite tackle shop (like I wish I did now...) because this game does nothing but disappoint!  Rant over."

414482,johnnyb,2009-12-22 15:23:00,3413,pro pilkki is amazing...that would be awesome on the wii.
