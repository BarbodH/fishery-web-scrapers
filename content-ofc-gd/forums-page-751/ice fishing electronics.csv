414359,Guest gbfisher,2009-12-22 02:45:00,0,Most electronics interfere with each other. It's nothing new. No big issue.
414362,Curtis,2009-12-22 02:47:00,83,from my experiance a flasher and a graph will interfer but i have never had a problem with two flashers in one area.. i could be wrong i usualy fish alone but when i have fished with other anglers using flashers i have had no problems but always with sonar units.
414367,Terry,2009-12-22 02:56:00,14456,if you  have a different ping speed on each unit it helps to reduce interference
414369,vinnimon,2009-12-22 02:57:00,2593,"I guess if i did the math with cone angles and depth,I could figure out the spacing between holes.The aqua view was my main concern.Possiby throwing off signals.I was ice fishing last year,my finder showed fish,and looking threw the view there was nothing.10 fow,very clear,no fish on the monitor,but lots on my finder.My hummingbird was brand new,so was the view."

414373,Terry,2009-12-22 03:02:00,14456,the fishfinder should show the camera as a solid line that doesn't change and will not affect the fishfinder any other way

414387,Terry,2009-12-22 03:35:00,14456,oh and ping speed is the space between each ping(signal bust)
414392,vinnimon,2009-12-22 04:07:00,2593,Thank you sir for the info.happy holidays to you as well.Ill go see if the wife will give me the H/J for xmass.
