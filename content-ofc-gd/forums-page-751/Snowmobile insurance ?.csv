414184,Dara,2009-12-21 17:02:00,3052,  It wouldn't fit down our trails
414198,Terry,2009-12-21 17:54:00,14456,chainsaw and dynamite will fix that..LOL
414218,Fisherman,2009-12-21 18:48:00,7201,"#1. Don't tell storys, and ""they"" won't know any better, call TD Primmum, it's also on line.  I'll bet you can get the basic coverage for around $120-$150 a year to keep it legal.  What do you use it for, puttering around on the farm and local trails where no permit is required."
414268,boatman,2009-12-21 21:14:00,350, TD was prepared to insure my 1973 Ski Doo 440 for the same as my 1993 Polaris 440 so I'd say give them a call.
414532,ciceri,2009-12-22 18:36:00,535,"I don't think they go by the size of the sled anymore, just who's riding it and the year.  Oh, and we also use TD."
414541,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-22 19:16:00,10439," Only large chunks of granite and they don't move too quickly, so it's pretty easy to get out of the way of them.     Yep, wouldn't fit down ours either. There is no such thing as a groomed trail where I live. Some are so narrow it's barely wide enough to fit the ski width."
414543,Terry,2009-12-22 19:24:00,14456,"yeah I guess it's about 10"" wider then a skidoo"
414558,Anderson,2009-12-22 20:20:00,32,"It ain""t pretty but it  drags my butt to where I gotta go I""m thinkin that 150 a year is reasonable I don't PUI or DUI  or SUI Just want to be covered when the other guy hits me and it ain't that wide Put yer head down and pinn it Sure to leave ya stranded Glad I have sno shoes They start everytime"
414604,Dara,2009-12-22 22:39:00,3052,  Plus the guys that broke the trail would toss you off of it for messing things up with those tracks.  They just aren't the proper vehicle for backwoods winter fishing
414609,Terry,2009-12-22 22:58:00,14456,in BC mountains they are the standard now...well the 4 track ones are ....no snowmobile can go where they go so I guess it depends on where you are
413797,cityfisher,2009-12-20 07:21:00,959,"Hi all  wondering how much I should expect to pay To insure a 97-2001 2up sled under 600cc,s?? I have a quad but would like something that can get me into back lakes  thanks!"
413804,Terry,2009-12-20 11:04:00,14456,
413815,cityfisher,2009-12-20 13:25:00,959,Thanks Terry but I'm pretty sure that quads with tracks are not aloumd on ofsc trails which would be a problem
413821,Terry,2009-12-20 13:47:00,14456,if it's the trail to a back lake there is no problem  add this and your good to go 
413822,cityfisher,2009-12-20 13:51:00,959,I might want to do some trail riding tooo  why only the half tracks??
413825,Terry,2009-12-20 13:56:00,14456,less to go wrong if a track comes off you can still travel  you lose no speed  you can put them on a 2X4 atv  I would think it would be possible to license it as a snowmobile    oh and on topic..LOL 2004  skidoo legend 500cc..152.00 a year
413826,Sandbag,2009-12-20 13:58:00,533,cityfisher  I have a 1999 ski-doo mxz 600 and I pay $150.00/year.  That is with TD Insurance.  Cheers  Craig
413832,Fisherman,2009-12-20 14:06:00,7201,"Ah, I don't think so,  with that logic, you could find someone to put a set of skis and tracks on your pick up and call it an oversized snowmobile.  My ATV floats and has provisions for an outboard, but it's still an ATV, not a boat."
413835,Terry,2009-12-20 14:10:00,14456,"well I know a guy who built his own snowmobile and got it licensed, it look more like a small car then a skidoo, I have seen snowmobiles with two tracks so I would think it comes down to the definition of what a snowmobile is  "
413916,boatman,2009-12-20 18:24:00,350, Those buggers! I pay TD $160 before tax for a 1993 Polaris Trail Deluxe 440 (with two up seat and reverse) and I'm located in Ancaster.  When I called around last year looking the the best deal TD came back with the best price.
413939,musky66,2009-12-20 20:09:00,273,I second TD Insurance. I had my sleds with them for years. My 18 year old son just insured a 2001 Mach Z triple for well under 300 with everything except collision.
413940,limeyangler,2009-12-20 20:11:00,5204,I 3rd TD insurance...best by far.  some insurers wont even insure sleds over 700cc.
413985,Wally,2009-12-20 22:31:00,28,TD  all the bells and whistle's $160
414069,Lunkerhunter,2009-12-21 02:01:00,455,i just got an 03 arctic cat pantera 550CC and it was 160. it is with intact insurance  it wont be too bad if your under 600CC i was told.
414080,richyb,2009-12-21 02:53:00,774,1994 zr 580   $150 with TD
414082,redneck666,2009-12-21 03:18:00,563,1981 ski-doo citation 3500 377cc $180..... older sled should be cheaper... but i got a cheaper insurance company this year so we'll see.
414085,Dara,2009-12-21 03:26:00,3052,"I got a quote for a new sled I'm considering and it was $882.00 for full coverage..Right now fire theft for the year and liability for the season is $450.  994 cc  Terry, that rig wouldn't be much good to you up here for fishing"
414102,richyb,2009-12-21 04:00:00,774,Hey terry is that a hitch a track?
414122,Terry,2009-12-21 10:48:00,14456,yeah it is a hitch a track
414147,DRIFTER_016,2009-12-21 14:05:00,10439,  My 1000cc 2008 Yamaha RS Venture GT is right around $300 with no collision and $800 with.
414152,Terry,2009-12-21 14:12:00,14456, why wouldn't it I was told it has a lighter footprint then a skidoo?
414155,Anderson,2009-12-21 14:33:00,32,I have an 81 citation with a 377 and they said that they wouldn't insure it Now what do I do cut up my fishing liscence???
414162,Dara,2009-12-21 15:09:00,3052,  that was for an Apex ltx gt  I'm on an 06 rage right now..same motor as your Venture..good thing you got nothing to hit up there so you don't need collision
414171,Fisherman,2009-12-21 15:52:00,7201,Who is the insurance company?  I know some will only give you the basic PL/PD with no fire/theft/collision for the older machines.
414182,Anderson,2009-12-21 16:49:00,32,"How much for the year???? I deal with Aviva Thats what they told me IT""s tooooo old Then when I said I wanted for fishing They told me a price around 450 because if it goes through the ice then there is salvage and dangerous chemical and yadda yadda yadda I""m sure she is still yappin about it The sled isn""t worth that But it starts on half a pull"
