413321,basskicker09,2009-12-18 23:05:00,144,is berkley vannish a true flourocarbon or not we have a reel spooled up with twenty pound and i want to know so i can use it as leader material for ice fishing for pike
413325,timmeh,2009-12-18 23:14:00,609,"A decent size pike can bite through that in it's sleep, but for smaller fish you may be okay. If you're targeting larger ones you'll probably want to go up to a higher pound test and get actual fluro leader material - it's a little tougher than vanish."
413331,redneck666,2009-12-18 23:24:00,563," i got one word to describe it.... CRAP!  other people may have different opinions. but with my use of it, i was very disapointed. broke even when tying knots, broke when i got a fish on, even the slightest abrations will kill the line and its certainly not very abrasion resistant. if i was you i would stick to the wire leaders, but to each their own. oh wait im talkin about soft water, lol. i still wouldnt use it for hard water either. go with real flouro that has proven good in the past. (i spooled my whole rod with vanish. i dont use flouro leaders just straight up wire, unless i got a flouro worm harness)  good luck,  JP"
413695,uglyfish,2009-12-20 00:02:00,981," AGREED!!! dont use the vanish!! the stuff is horrible. twists up too much, and has a very weak breaking strength."
413704,redneck666,2009-12-20 00:49:00,563,ya thats right i forgot to mention the amount of twist that comes with that line....
413787,Dabluz,2009-12-20 04:49:00,701,"What I find funny about Berkley Vanish is the fact that it is expensive.  Just about everybody knows that it's crap yet every year I keep seeing the stuff for sale.  The Vanish ""leader material"" is stiffer and harder (I cut my line with my teeth) and yet I will never use it again.  Maybe using some 20 lb Vanish on a baitcasting reel would be ok since baitcast reels do not twist the line.  I suggest that anyone who does want to use 20 or 25 lb test Vanish on a baitcasting outfit to buy Dollarstore lures.  I've used the large banana style minnow baits for pike and they work great.  However, I haven't caught any real big pike with them yet."
413790,jace,2009-12-20 05:38:00,472,"Yes, it's a real FC line, not a co-polymer.     Try it for yourself, you might like it.  Vanish was one of the early FC lines and it's still on the market so it must be selling.   As for using it as leader material, it depends on the fish and conditions.   The only line i wouldn't use as leader is Sufix elite mono, it's soft and one of the least abrasion resistant lines i've ever used."
413905,redneck666,2009-12-20 17:27:00,563,"heres a thought fer you guys. 10lb berkley trilene extra tough line is really abrasion resistant when i use it, i was trolling with my line (12lb vanish) and my father was trolling with his line (10lb trilene XT) and half way through a very productive day with walleye and pike my line was the most abraded while his line was almost perfect! trilene XT is good line IMO.  JP"

413981,vinnimon,2009-12-20 22:28:00,2593,"I gave it a try once in a tourney.Its called Vanish because,when you use it ,it vanishes from your spool.Then I tried another brand the same thing.There on sale and selling for a reason.No different with tools."
413987,vinnimon,2009-12-20 22:36:00,2593,"My oldest at 8yrs old,had more luck with 4lb xl on an ultralight rod,a 5 lbs sucker.than what I got on the 8lbs vanish.A 2lb or so bass snapped the line.She was fishing in rock structure.me in pools on the river."
414074,fishindude,2009-12-21 02:31:00,220,"Has anyone tried the Transition version of the Berkley Vanish? Is it any better than the clear one?  Like everyone else has already posted, the clear Vanish is simply terrible."
414076,Mike01,2009-12-21 02:43:00,378,"I used 20lbs all summer as leader material.  Never once had a problem.  I ever used it when I was down in Florida fishing for redfish around mangroves and docks, never once broke off."
414081,redneck666,2009-12-21 03:15:00,563," oh ya! hahaha! i remember that thread, lol."
414099,ohhenrygsr,2009-12-21 03:48:00,947,  LOL all i gotta say is I've been using Seaguar and have never looked back.  Once you go Seaguar you don't go back
414106,danc,2009-12-21 04:32:00,4677," I don't know why you'd want to spend that kind of cash just to be stealthy for Pike. I'm pretty sure that you could use 1/4"" yellow nylon rope for a leader and be just as successful."
414114,redneck666,2009-12-21 06:43:00,563,DanC has a point!
414378,Dabluz,2009-12-22 03:15:00,701,Pike often attack the walleyes that are on the end of my fishing chain that is hanging from my boat or canoe.  Everything is quite visible.
414528,rapala14,2009-12-22 18:30:00,44,Absolute garbage.   Tried it for the first time this year for rainbows.  took it off and respooled with XT a couple days later.  I've felt less ripped off at small town strip clubs
414678,Dabluz,2009-12-23 01:30:00,701,"  I often cut my line with my teeth and it's quite easy to feel the difference in the hardness of different lines.  I can't cut braid or Fireline no matter how small it is and how hard and long I grind my teeth.  Yes, XT is very hard and therefore very abrasion resistant....for a mono or a fluorocarbon line.  I wouldn't use it on a spinning reel with a small spool or for a spinng combo for casting but for trolling, I haven't found any better for the same price.  Yes, it's been around for about 40 years yet it's hard to improve on a good thing.  I haven't used it with a baitcasting combo but I bet it works great.  If you do a search on the internet using the words ""fishing line abrasion test"" you will find a lot of interesting info."
414731,bigugli,2009-12-23 03:59:00,6138, the place i will be fishing for pike is on a small pond or lake in our area called martindale pond it receives a good amout of ice fishing pressure and have tried wire in the past with no luck then last year i used braid and did ok so i want to improve my odds even more due to i dont like perching so much when there are monster pike to be had LOL  thanks for all the info ill will give it a shot but not keep my hopes up lol and i wont rant about it if it keeps breaking but i will light it on fire if it does because it seems like a fun thing to do  crap forgot to sign myself in this post is by Rob D
