414320,raptorfan,2009-12-22 00:21:00,126,lots of open water when I was there today
414329,Stern Rules,2009-12-22 00:42:00,342,Thanks. I must check it out tomorrow then. Did you fish it at all?
414700,raptorfan,2009-12-23 02:16:00,126,"no, was just driving through for work.  Was through there again tonight on my way home, and every pond is icing over now, with snow on the ice"
414715,Stern Rules,2009-12-23 02:47:00,342,Well I guess I might not head out there tomorrow then. Was gonna go today but hit Bass Pro instead. Thanks for the info.
