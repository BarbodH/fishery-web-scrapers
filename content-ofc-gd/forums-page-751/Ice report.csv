411106,Joeytier,2009-12-12 01:06:00,3990,I'd wager that BOQ ice is FAR more dangerous than any of the Kawarthas.
411123,cowanjo,2009-12-12 02:33:00,249,"I have set up a rink over one of my favourite fishing holes in the past three winters. We love it up there - is it risky - maybe - before I sent the kids out I did the work and drilled some holes to see. I waited to feb so I guess I tried to limit the risk.  Please take your garbage with you, have a beer at my place afterwards and cook and share the fish at my place'  John C"
411141,Paully,2009-12-12 06:04:00,712, try not to ruffle your feathers crappiePH....  sometimes jokes are just meant to be jokes..  Obviously nobody wants anyone to lose their life..
411143,lew,2009-12-12 09:50:00,12766,"Every year when the ice starts to form there's a discussion on this board about folks pushing their luck and heading onto the ice too early and somebody going thru & drowning.....EVERY year.  Jediangler is a good guy and I doubt he was trying to stir anybodies pot, it's just that folks are now going to be heading onto the Kawartha ice for the 1st time, in unfamiliar territory, and as mentioned by Raf, there's ALOT of current in some of the areas that will keep the ice thin while it looks good on top.  New water.....new dangers"
411152,Jer,2009-12-12 11:46:00,1426,"  If you wanna fish the narrows at any time of year, you'll need a boat...it never freezes over, open water all winter.  Some people must think that since there has never been fishing through the ice around here, noone has ever been on it. If you drive across the causeway on Chemong, you'll see that the lake is very busy all winter long with everything except ice fishing, most years there is an ""ice-road"" on Chemong from the causeway all the way to Curve Lake.  As long as I've lived here, there have been very few, if any, cases of people or vehicles going through the ice and trust me, there are lots of vehicles out there every year. It's not just fishermen who use the ice. Sure there are lots of places to avoid due to current. such as Gannons Narrows, but if people excersise caution and common sense (I know, I know...it's not so common anymore) you'll be fine.  As Michael said, ice-fishermen are some of the safest people on the ice. There will always be ""yahoos"" who push the envelope but you don't need a fishing season to bring them out of the woodwork.  My guess is the first drowning you hear of on the Kawarthas this year, if there are any, won't be a fisherman.  The ice has always been here and people have always been using it for fun and transportation, just that now we get to drill a few holes and hopefully pull a few fish through them."
411175,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-12 13:27:00,2582,  No feathers ruffled here....I would rather focus on the positives this new opportunity brings all of us rather then the negatives...that's all.  Everybody play safe and enjoy there time on the hardwater this winter. I know I'm just ITCHING to get out
411202,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-12 14:35:00,1362,   Well......good old Mother Nature put a dent in my Muskie Hunt overnight and it's now time to put the gear away until next June  Here's a pic from Friday and what I woke up to today      There's even the odd pressure crack!!    Be safe out there folks!!!  Steve
411303,Beans,2009-12-12 19:48:00,3339, I thought the doctor gave you sumpin' for that...
411381,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-13 00:34:00,2582,  Nothing the Doc can do Beansie...only cure is 4+ inches of ice.
411394,Jer,2009-12-13 01:32:00,1426,"I bought a new 6"" hand auger at BPS today. Punched a few holes just off shore in my bay, already a good 5"" of ice. Hopefully the snow stays away and we can get some good ice building weather. Buckhorn is frozen over as far as I can see as of yesterday morning."
411909,Beans,2009-12-14 22:03:00,3339,14 Dec 2009...Cloudy and visibility poor...+1*C  Took a look out over the north end of Tait's Bay this afternoon...Looks like ice but mostly slush...In the first picture that is Hurricane Point way out near the center...In the second picture Hurricane Point is over on the left:      With the cold temps expected in the next few days it should firm up in time for New Years Day 2010...  I will take more pics later in the week and next week...  15 Dec 2009...Sunny and clear -2*C  Just got back from grocery shopping in town...I noticed the area out beyond Hurricane Point (south shore of Tait's Bay is open water...considering that would be the natural flow of the current in the lake I wasn't suprised...
412154,jimmer,2009-12-15 15:23:00,2730,"Pigeon south of Grenadier Island still has open water where the main current flows, so it will need some colder weather to tighten up for the opening."
413938,Beans,2009-12-20 20:04:00,3339,"20 December 2009...Ice update  Same two pics as taken above on the 14th dec 09 only no slush anywhere...      Note toboggan tracks out to a skating rink the neighborhood kids cleared:    I wandered over to our beach area and chopped a hole about 15 feet off shore...found a good five inches of ice over 3 fow (notice spud sitting on bottom) so I'll guess we will be good to go on 1st January 2010 barring any severe thawing...    On my way back to my truck I saw a guy walking in from behind the island in the second picture...he sez there is pretty well a uniform 5 inches of ice all over the area he walked...  Once we get a foot or more of ice, finding a place to drive on will be the next challenge..."
413956,Jer,2009-12-20 21:08:00,1426,"  I hear ya Beans, I keep hoping to run into the guy who plows our road so I can ask him to keep our rough boat launch at the end of the road clear of any snow banks.  I walked halfway out into the bay today, drilled a bunch of holes all about 6"".  On Thursday I saw some snowmobile tracks on Chemong by the causeway already. A little dicy there I would imagine, It's only been frozen over about a week. The ice in front of my place has been there almost three weeks."
413961,GBW,2009-12-20 21:13:00,8460,"Nope, no potatoes in those pic's..."
413990,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-20 22:43:00,2582,  Thx for the update Beansie. There a good chance the crappies & gills might not be to far from that skating rink  I'm really looking forward to Kawartha ice. Sounds good for Jan 1st.
410693,jimmer,2009-12-10 20:47:00,2730,Well the lower end of Pigeon Lake has started to freeze over.  I have heard that there are a few anglers itching to get out there and try the new panfish season.  Not sure that the lower end will produce as it is very shallow in the winter and we don't have much luck with panfish in the fall in that area.  I'm hoping to try north of Grenadier Island once it is safe.  Anyone alse planning on trying that area?
410733,Beans,2009-12-10 22:33:00,3339,No ice at the top end of Pigeon...just lots of whitecaps with the winds we are having...  The lagoon where we dock our boats was half open water and the other half looks like the wind has pushed a lot of slush in...
410804,Joeytier,2009-12-11 00:57:00,3990,"Are these changes to zone 17 effective immediately, or do people still have to wait until 2010 to be able to fish these lakes?  If possible, I'd like to hit a few of these lakes as soon as I possibly can."
410809,Michael_Brown,2009-12-11 01:03:00,411,"The new regulations do not come into effect until Jan 1, 2010 in zone 17. We will have to wait until then, although Pigeon should be frozen by then."
410810,Joeytier,2009-12-11 01:04:00,3990,Alright.  Thanks for clearing that up.
410820,Tom McCutcheon,2009-12-11 01:35:00,627,"The bay I am on is frozen solid this morning. Probably 2 to 3 inches.  There was a deer walking down the far side late this afternoon. Still too soon to venture out though, open water at the mouth of the bay. If this keeps up we will be in good shape by 2010.  Tom."
410822,irishfield,2009-12-11 01:40:00,26272,+C temps Sunday/Monday/Tuesday.. might even get one more kick at the Muskie on GBay come Tuesday !!
410834,jediangler,2009-12-11 02:32:00,1923,Any bets on which Kawartha lake claims the first ice fisherman? I figure by Jan. 3rd someone will go down for the count.
410837,Paully,2009-12-11 02:49:00,712, This will be a sad day.. but i say Pigeon lake
410868,Twocoda,2009-12-11 05:47:00,4130, for that very reason is why i dont ice fish
410873,Jer,2009-12-11 10:59:00,1426,   ...because nobody ever falls out of a boat and drowns in open water...
410877,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-11 11:57:00,1362,  I'll be out on the water for a last Muskie hunt all weekend here on the Mighty O....good luck Wayne
410879,Roy,2009-12-11 12:11:00,13728,"Good luck to you out there, Steve. Stay safe out there."
410880,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-12-11 12:15:00,1362, Thanks Roy   ....we'll all be wearing our survival suits for sure!!!! 
410898,jimmer,2009-12-11 14:09:00,2730,I sure hope that anglers avoid Gannons Narrows.
410936,Beans,2009-12-11 16:05:00,3339, I think as long as people avoid going near the bridges where there is current they may do well over by the east side...don't know for sure as I've only fished open water at Gannons...
410964,Michael_Brown,2009-12-11 18:12:00,411,"  With that kind of thinking it's a wonder any angler ever survive's fishing a new body of water. I wonder jediangler how you have made it this far considering how ""dangerous"" fishing is.  Personally I use good judgement, look at maps ask questions and proceed with caution anytime I'm accessing new water, winter or summer.  Smart ass comments aside, it's exciting acessing new water to fish. Caution is used and lessons are learned to hopefully make it a fun day. The oppourtunity to fish these lakes in the winter is fanatstic. I realize that accidents can happen but they will everywhere people access new water regardless of the season. Ice anglers are some of the safest people out there, as we carry tools to check the ice depth.  Be safe and have fun."
410971,jediangler,2009-12-11 18:51:00,1923,"If I put your rose coloured glasses on Michael I see no one going out on the ice too early, no one drinking while ice-fishing, no one leaving their garbage behind on the ice, everyone wearing their survival suits and ice-picks, everyone checking ice thickness on lakes never before fished, nobody keeping any walleye, no one trespassing on private property for access and no drowning deaths this winter in the Kawarthas.  I have to take the glasses off now they're giving me a headache.  I wish everyone a safe winter season but I'm a realist at heart.  By the way my bets on Sturgeon lake."
411002,Michael_Brown,2009-12-11 20:20:00,411,Well we will have to agree to disagree. I will keep my rose coloured glasses because I like them better than the dark ones that only see negative.  I hope people enjoy the new oppourtunies with their family and friends. Spend time angling with their children in this great region and have a safe and happy winter.
411003,Paully,2009-12-11 20:21:00,712,  Well said...  Wait till people bring their trucks out there
411034,Sinker,2009-12-11 21:59:00,8692,"What makes the Kawartha's any more dangerous than say.....simcoe?  Icefishing is dangerous, anywhere you go. Lose touch with common sense and good judgment, and people die in the best of conditions.   Looking at this opportunity as a manner of killing people is wacked if you ask me. Placing bets is just sick!!  S."
411036,Guest steel'n'esox,2009-12-11 22:09:00,0,"It doesnt matter which lake you ice fish people take risks, are uninformed, or are jacked up on good ole Whisky or maybe a little cheeb to boot, as they say know your limit play within it, If people can loose vehicles in Temagami theyll loose them in the Kawarthas as well, if there stupid enough to take a vehicle out on the ice, at least keep the doors open for a quick exit. Cant wait for the new fishin opportunities, with lakes like eels and anstruther etc been closed in 1986 for a five year period to see if populations build guess what 23 years later there still closed?  Maybe more opportunities will generate more licences and more revenue for the government to put in the general kiddy to pave roads etc"
411088,Meely,2009-12-12 00:30:00,282,"I have been speaking with a lot of the ""yocals"" in the area over the past few years..... It seems they all say the same thing.  You REALLY have to be careful out on Pigeon as there are some really crazy spots with bad current. I understand that most lakes have crazy current ""zones"" but I would imagine Pigeon etc isnt that well travelled in the winter............  I know there are a lot of sledders but I personally havent had ANY experience out on this lake in the winter. SO....... I think Im gonna tak'er nice and easy and cautiously do some more homework before I venture out.  Meely"
411096,Raf,2009-12-12 00:35:00,3495," there is current in a lot of areas on the kawarthas and since ice fishn is a new thing on the lakes, many people may not be aware of these areas."
411104,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-12 01:02:00,2582,  Gotta agree with you Shayne. I just find it classless and disturbing. We all know the risks and the unfortunate things that can/will happen. But to make a game of it. Not my style thank you.
