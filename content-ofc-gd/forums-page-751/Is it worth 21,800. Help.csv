413476,Handlebarz,2009-12-19 09:56:00,3790,I would suggest you look for just a boat then head over to Angling outfitters and have your boat rigged up for you people try and get as much as they can for the old stuff when its a package deal Jos will set you up and it will be for what you need not what was on the boat you go in tell him what you are fishing for and what bodies of water he will set you up and you will not have any problems if you do he will replace or fix stuff right away not Bull here he is the man and stands behind what he does.  I bought a 1994 a couple seasons ago and it has been a amazing boat you can find some older boats in great shape and alot better deals then what that person wants (I know you passed on it) the winter is here and this is the time to buy with Christmas and lack of work in some areas you will find a better deal and I bet even a steal. but consider going with out all the works and add on later. even a kicker later will save you $$$  One other thing you dont need a pass port to go into the USA get the up graded drivers licence and your good to go.

If you go on a public forum to ask for advice you have to be a little more humble. You came  here to serve yourself and not offer anything. From what I read, you got a lot of good advice, and some of it required a little bit of effort, and you were hesitant. Some people made a few nasty remarks, and I cannot say that they were all unwarrented. However you were completely out of line in your last post . By doing what you did, it shows that you used this forum in an utterly self serving manner, and getting what you were looking for, and now by saying what you did, you wiil probably not post again. You should not only give a big thankyou from what you got from this forum, but give a SINSCERE apology for what you added to this forum. This is a perspective from a NUETRAL reader."
414584,bigfish1965,2009-12-22 21:56:00,3382,We don't want his apology..and besides he can't post it now anyway  Any doubt about what he was has been vanquished.

No one has said anything about that one that i am very interested in. I understand it is used but it is used very lightly and there is still a warranty so i think that it would be ok. I would like to know from you guys becuase some of you may have bought a few boats in your time. Im sure there are a few boat delers and mechanics around which would know what the price should be. That is why i come here and yes i am taking advice from you all as i just turned down the last boat because of OFC's help. I want to find a good deal if it takes time ""so be it"" but i am in the looking -buying mode right now and i will be jumping quickly on a boat if the price is right, and that is why i come here to post the boats that i find that i like. Then to get an opinion about it. Isnt it what this forum is about? I must say that everyone has been really good and i hope that i may still be able to get some help here. If you guys find anything that may be worth me looking at please feel free to post the link.  FYI - I DONT WANT TO BUY FROM THE STATES. I dont want it. I am sure i may find a few deals there. But i am a newbee when it comes to that and i just am not comfortable buying from the states. canadian only. Thanks"

413133,bigfish1965,2009-12-18 05:30:00,3382,"Lots of us have said plenty about the boat...such as don't buy it without driving it, take it to a qualified marina and get it looked after. Some have said pass on it completely. No one has said GO BUY IT. Which is what you want someone to say.   So here it is in a nutshell. IMHO you are taking a huge risk buying this boat, but you have made up your mind and are just trying to get someone to agree. You have made excuse after excuse to not look elsewhere or go to the Boat Show or the Spring Fishing SHow or the Sportsman Show. Buy the damm boat. Take your chances that you pissed away 20 grand when you could get so much more for the same cash. Its your money...do what you want. But for the love of gawd stop asking the same questions and putting up roadblocks. None of us will be in the boat or making the payments..you will. Can you live with that risk? I would not pay more than 16K for that boat no matter what. You don't even know if there is compression in the cylinders!!"
413134,fishnpro,2009-12-18 05:32:00,93,"OK, first off if you have nothing positive to add why do you even bother posting or looking at the post all together.

Blew 16 G's!! on a boat after looking at it twice....after i REPLACED: the motor, the steering, the trim, and the trolling motor.....the thing runs great......$35000 later...... Darryl,  you know who this is.....buddy take my advice.......BUY A NEW BOAT!!!!!!......warranties and boats are a blessing...don't make the same mistake i did.......even if you throw $20 G's on a new boat worth twice that, it'll be loaded to the T * * 's and covered by warranty.....give me a call when you get in and we`ll go look at a few if you want......talk to you soon bud."
413136,bigfish1965,2009-12-18 05:38:00,3382, Effective oversight is not always positive. We have been trying to gently to push him away from this deal. And you are saying the same thing we are....don't buy the boat. He ain't listening.

413146,pikehunter,2009-12-18 10:42:00,1659,"Just buy the bloody boat and get it over with. Let us know next season after you have ran it a couple of times how great a deal it was.  You have received good sound advise but like Rick said, you just want someone to agree that it is a good deal so you can justify your decision.  Don't know if you have 20 G's burning a hole in your pocket or if you are borrowing the coin, not my business or my problem but I will quote what my father once said to me. ""If you have to borrow the money to buy a new car you probably can't afford it but if you insist on going in the hole then at least buy a new one, so you will have some guaranty of quality."" In my opinion a boat is much the same as a car, however a car does get you to work so you can make the money to pay for your dreams.  I may not have a fancy big boat with a lot of neat toys attached to it but it is paid for, bought it new in '05, boat, motor, trailer, custom cover and a fish finder. I purchased it in the fall with a down payment and no loan but had it all paid for in cash when I took delivery the following April. That was the agreement, a deposit and as long as it was paid out in full by delivery it was mine. Just loved dropping by the dealer throughout the winter with a grand or more cash in hand every once in a while to pay them."
413176,bigredfisher,2009-12-18 14:46:00,300,"im not buying the boat, because of your advice. I am taking all the advice i can, that is why i am asking. I will be looking aswell. I would love to take it for a test drive but unless i drive to the niagra i dont think that is possible. Unless some ramps on ontario dont freeze, any suggestions?  I have passed on that boat which is what i was suggested to do. Trust me i am listening and taking all the advice i can. Im am not trying to wait for the advice i want to hear. I am looking for the real truthfull answer. I am about to spend 20 k on a boat so that is why i am being a lil picky here... wouldnt you??????.  i do want to make this clear. I have looked at new boats and cant find a package deal or even try to make my own. It all works out to be over 20 k.  i would like to find everything included for 20k downriggers, gps, kicker, radio, vhf. the boats that were suggested to me are 20k and dont have anything. I could easily put 10 grand into that and i cant do that.  so please let me know your suggestions..... i am listening and taking all the advice i can.  ps: if you come across anything that seems like it fits what i want. Please feel free to post the link. thanks  ps: I am not borrowing the coin. I already have it. Just to let you know."
413178,troutologist,2009-12-18 14:53:00,951,Have you thought about a canoe?  The purchase of a boat seems a little complex for you.

413181,Vanselena,2009-12-18 14:56:00,269, I've heard so many horror stories about this particular boat and dealer.
413182,bigredfisher,2009-12-18 14:57:00,300,ill keep that in mind what is the name of the dealership?
413183,charlesn,2009-12-18 15:00:00,551,"People are saying to wait for the boat show and to buy new.  Asking why the rush?  Here's a couple thoughts:  1) People are selling boats now because they don't want to store for the winter or are in desperate financial straits.  Now is the time to take advantage of them - as crass as that may sound.  It's a negotiation, you want every tool at your disposal to get the price down.  A couple thousand can buy a lot of goodies for the boat.  2) Buy new?  NEVER.  I will let someone else take that first and biggest depreciation hit.  I have nothing against the boat dealers or used boat sellers of Ontario/Canada, but I always buy south because I'm not a rich enough person to be spending $25K for convenience when I can get it for $20K by making a road trip.  The dollar is strong enough now to make it a no brainer.  The variety and number of used boats in the states also fosters price competition, offers colour/motor/feature selection and thus you are better able to ""shop around"" in the comfort of your office chair.  3) Boat show deals.  Are there some decent deals available?  Yes.  Do they take advantage of the fact that DEMAND is at a peak during the show while supply remains relatively stable?  Yes.  They count on the emotion of you seeing a bunch of other people looking at ""your"" potential boat and hope it will be a mitigating factor in your signing on the dotted line.  It is a good place to go and look at a bunch of different models and such, but if you know what you are looking for, I don't think it is the best bet.  Just my personal opinions from having been in the boat market 4-5 times in the past decade.  As far as the boat listed on this thread, I'd pass on it.  Much better deals to be had.  Also, not saying it's the case for bigred, but some people cannot get a passport and some people just don't want or need one.  For me, it's a necessity for the NY bass season, but I'd also say it is worth it for a one-time trip to pick up a boat.  Grab a buddy, make a weekend fishing trip out of it.  You get good times and save a bundle on a boat.  The best boat shopping/browsing site I've found is boattraderonline.com"
413184,bigredfisher,2009-12-18 15:04:00,300,thank you soo much. I wont be around for the show but i want to find something while i am down in ontario. I just got to find the right one. thanks soo much for the advice
413205,jimmer,2009-12-18 16:40:00,2730,"Hang in there Bigredfisher and be patient.  I don't think the boats will be flying off the sales market at this time of the year.  You shouldn't miss out on one if you are waiting to think about the deal, and if you do miss out, another will come along.  Nothing wrong with asking for advice here, especially with some of the scams that are showing up on other websites."

Its December.........you can't use a boat for months. Take your time with a purchase like that.  BTW, I was looking at a 22' Starcraft Center console, with a 175 merc saltwater, 9.9 kicker for 10G's. Both engines were 2007's, the hull was a late 90's in mint condition. There are lots of good boats out there for the coin you want to spend.

MI has so many cheap boats - they are really hurting down there. A year and a half ago I bought a 2003 Fishhawk 1650 with a 70 4 stroke, trailer... that was in super shape for 8500 Cdn once I paid taxes and everything. The same boat was actually selling, not listed, for over 12 000 in Ontario at the time. Not bragging just giving an example. My friend just got a 1700 FHawk with a 90 2 stroke that was barely used for even less - and yes he is bragging:) Look into it. Test drive the boat on a lake! All you need is the boat and trailer title and make sure the trailer still has the legal info sticker on it. You must have all of these things from the seller - not copies and titles must be clear. Stop in at the border and pay GST on the way back home. I figure i saved $3000 for driving 6 hours - that's $500 an hour. Well worth it to me. Landry"

Go to the shows,you will surprised at the deals they have.  Wish I had 20,g,s to blow on a boat.Hell if I did,it wouldnt be on a used one.  Theres something marshy about this."
413083,Roy,2009-12-18 02:09:00,13728, Ding ding.... we have a winner!  I'm awed by the generosity and patience of our members. Thank you guys.
413085,irishfield,2009-12-18 02:17:00,26272,Thank goodness the customs office at the Kebec border has an express bypass.. or you might not get home for Christmas...  
413086,HTHM,2009-12-18 02:19:00,4082,If nothing else I found a great site to look for boats.....other than the ones I frequent.
413088,BillM,2009-12-18 02:24:00,17367,"All the guys here are willing to help, but I still wouldn't be dropping 20k on a boat because someone on a online forum thinks it's a good deal....  Go to the shows, figure out exactly what you want, then make an informed decision."

412743,bigredfisher,2009-12-17 04:29:00,300,hi this is the boat that i am about to purchase. Davey feel free to add your imput aswell. It comes with 2 electric riggers with auto stop and 1 gps/sonar fish finder. It comes with 2 yamaha motors (2008 motors no more than 50 hrs on them). What is the approximate value for this boat. I want to make sure that its worth it. what do you guys think? here are some pics.....             thanks. bigredfisher
412745,irishfield,2009-12-17 04:30:00,26272,I was right.. the cover doesn't match the carpet ! lol  What year is this boat that you were buying for sure>??  Is the full top any good... looks kinda rough in the picture.
412751,grt1,2009-12-17 04:47:00,638,"This is the way I would look at it, The motors are 2 years old with VERY little time on them , they were probably worth 15,000 for the big motor and 6,000 for the little one (at least here in Red Lake), The depreciation for the blue book on them may make them worth considerably less, but since you are looking at the total package, they are still worth 15,000 together to you. The downriggers and other accessories are easily worth a 1000 and the boat trailer is worth 500, ,so that is 16,500 leaving the rest for the value of the boat. Any boat that floats up our way is worth 1000 and this boat looks in pretty good shape and worth the difference they are asking.  To me, I think this is a pretty good deal, I'm sure the seller could get more up here if it were located here."

412754,bigfish1965,2009-12-17 05:02:00,3382,I have alarm bells going off because of the three different carpets in there. Was it sunk? I cannot imagine why someone would do that.
412756,irishfield,2009-12-17 05:04:00,26272,But Rick.. you didn't care about carpet colour yesterday ! lol Why we've been trying to tell this lad something for weeks...
412761,bigfish1965,2009-12-17 05:26:00,3382,I thought it had all ONE carpet color. Having three different colors means something completely different. The original beige is on the vertical surfaces with red and green on the floors. Is there any duct tape?
412762,bigredfisher,2009-12-17 05:29:00,300,nope no duct tape
412764,irishfield,2009-12-17 05:37:00,26272,What year is the boat??? Is the green carpet just thrown down over top of the red?
412766,bigredfisher,2009-12-17 05:40:00,300,the boat is a 2001 and motors 2008 no i think that the carpet is whole
412768,irishfield,2009-12-17 05:55:00,26272,"Page 19 has your boat..  http://www.princecraft.com/upload//archive...f4-c027f79eb8fa  Suggested USA value +  add adjustments for the new motors of course! Motors are worth about $12,000 more RETAIL than the old ones.  http://www.nadaguides.com/default.aspx?LI=...c=mr&gtc=MR"
412771,Dutch,2009-12-17 06:29:00,831,"Definitely NOT worth that money IMO.  Seller is trying to get too much for the ""new"" motors.  Did you check kijiji for comparables - you won't find the exact same one, but probably something similar.  NADA guides are OK, but are relied on more heavily in the US.  Most boats in Canada sell for a premium of the nada guide amounts.  Speaking of US boats - have you looked for one there?  The dollar is very favourable right now and it is really quite easy to bring them across the border.  DON'T be in a huury when buying a boat - you will find one eventually.  Being in a hurry leads to irrational decisons.  The boats looks terrible with all those different carpets in there - should raise alarm bells....  A boat that size ""should"" have a built in gas tank, but I see a jerry can in there - why?  Can you water test it somewhere?  If you can't don't buy it.  For comparison purposes, I had a line on a new non-current 2007 with a 2009 115, only 17 foot though with full top and 55 pound tm for $17K taxes in.  I guess no kicker and no riggers, but still that boat is 9 years old...just seems like a lot to pay."
412785,danbouck,2009-12-17 12:00:00,4380,No
412788,Fisherman,2009-12-17 12:21:00,7201,"Why not just go and buy a new boat, it will solve a lot of your headaches."
412793,Jer,2009-12-17 12:28:00,1426,"Has the seller given you a reason for the tri-colour carpet? It certainly didn't come from the factory like that unless it was a Christmas special (green & red).  Why the newer motors? What happened to the original motors? Generally a boat like that would have been sold as a package of some sort with factory or dealer installed motors.  Why the portable gas tank? I hope it's just hooked up to the kicker because somebody was too lazy to tee into the built in tank, I'm sure it has one. I wouldn't want to go too far with a 115 drinking from a 5 gallon tank, even if it is a 4 stroke.  Too many questions to spend that kinda dough in my opinion.  Seerms to me the boat has been sunk (and left submerged for some period of time). It would answer all the above concerns. The original carpet, motor and fuel tank were all damaged, contaminated or ruined to some extent for some reason.  If you got over 20 grand to spend on a boat, why you would even look at used packages like that is beyond me."
412797,dave524,2009-12-17 12:43:00,4508,"No, in addition to the other boat issues I think I see a dent just above one of the guide bunks, any more?  For example, here is a similar vintage hull, somewhat larger, looks to be in far nicer shape, well cared for, well equipped with lots of extras, something someone took a little pride in. OK, there is a known issue with the main power, but with months till spring and  12G's of wiggle room for repower or rebuild, you could come off with a much nicer package IMHO.  For that money,  I would be looking for a hull in this shape.  http://forums.quintefishing.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=7951"
412800,Mike01,2009-12-17 12:50:00,378,"If the guys are right and this boat has sunk at some point it will never be the same no matter how much they try and dress it up.  Trust me, I've been there!!"
412801,azebra,2009-12-17 12:56:00,168,Diddo.. maybe just worn out? so.. AstroTurf?
412803,craigdritchie,2009-12-17 12:57:00,1586,"Dude, you so should have bought that red Lund in Lewiston. With the $14,000 you would have saved, you could have paid someone to go get it and deliver it right to your driveway, and still had at least $12,000 left over."
412808,bushart,2009-12-17 13:21:00,2628,I'm saying the $$$ is too much.  *****This Is Key***---Don't buy any Used boat without putting in the water---are you able to do this in your area-this time of year?  I think you can shop around----you may find a better deal in the spring when people are trading in for new models.  Downriggers and electronics can always be installed by you on another craft.  Bushart
412822,justin elia,2009-12-17 14:20:00,151,"When I purchased my boat, I made sure to get it inspected by a professional.  Try Doug at Bay City Marine in Hamilton or Top Gun Marine in Bradford.  Also find out where the owner got the boat serviced; if at all, they might be able to help.  If the owner wants to sell it, have him tow to the shop and pay for the inspection.  Best $100 you can spend.  You should do all this before trying to speculate what its worth.  I also agree with Bushart, make sure you take it for a spin too."
412825,hirk,2009-12-17 14:25:00,571,"For the same money you could get the same boat in mint condition.It may be functionally sound but thats not very old for having the carpet redone.My general impression is that it has not been well looked after because if there was ANY pride of ownership he would NEVER have put that junk carpet in the boat to begin with,100% pass on this 1 Darryl."
412891,bigredfisher,2009-12-17 17:07:00,300,the carpet hasnt been redone as i thought it had been. The green carpet was just thrown on there to protect the red carpet. What do you think is it a go or a no go?
412906,Meegs,2009-12-17 17:50:00,249,"i just came from dropping off our boat at the Legend dealer and was having a look around.   they have some pretty sweet 18-20' boats out there ready to fish with riggers, rods, trolling motor, full enclosures for anywhere from 18500-25000 and there all BRAND NEW!    i think id be having a look around"
412907,bigredfisher,2009-12-17 17:51:00,300,what i did(based on some of the quotes here) was offer him 19 k for it. Is that still to high. I dont think hes gonna take it though so thanks for the help. I think that im gonna walk. Thanks soo much. If he does decide to take 19 for it (very doubtful) so i go for it. I am on the search again. Feel free to add some links to good deals cause i dont know. I just checked out bigfatbass.com.   let me know thanks again  bigredfisher
