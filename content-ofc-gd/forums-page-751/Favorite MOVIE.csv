414121,lew,2009-12-21 10:34:00,12766,"My brother & I were kids in the 50's so the Christmas Story always brings back lotsa fun memories and is an absolute favorite of mine, but I haven't seen it around for a few years now.  Christmas Vacation is hilarious too, but my problem  is, I haven't got the patience to sit thru a 2 hour movie but I've seen about a dozen 15 minute clips so far this season so I think I've just about got the whole show covered this year  Last time I was in a movie theater was 1977 when Close Encounters came out"
414125,blarg,2009-12-21 12:02:00,289,  You should see your doctor   rudolph or charlie brown
414131,solopaddler,2009-12-21 13:15:00,8605,Watching The Polar Express has become a yearly tradition with my little ones. Great movie.
414132,Harrison,2009-12-21 13:25:00,2202,"No doubt, Christmas vacation, mainly because of Cousin ""Pooper was full"" Eddie (his character inspired 2 halloween costumes for me) and the rant by Clark about his boss. John Hughes was a genius."
414133,NAC,2009-12-21 13:28:00,369,  definitely! One of my all time favourite Candy movies too.
414134,Governator,2009-12-21 13:35:00,879,"1. A Christmas Carol (I've seen like 10 different versions, it's just a good story all around) 2. Home Alone 3. Christmas Vacation"

414203,rylan,2009-12-21 17:59:00,134,and everyone forgot about the best Christmas movie:      PLATOON   
414209,packrat,2009-12-21 18:22:00,93,  Right on---no contest!!!!
414216,bigbuck,2009-12-21 18:46:00,2449,"Christmas Vacation!!!! Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Kiss my A.....s, Kiss her A....s, Kiss his A....s..............  A great movie full of laughs, classic Chevy Chase. We saw Christmas Carol (the new animated version) and it was great but a bit much for my little ones (almost 5 and 3). Stuck to Dickens' original story line quite well.  And A Christmas Story, great movie. I never did get a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas."
414253,Cookslav,2009-12-21 20:18:00,1457,"A Christmas Carol   Ditto,  My Family and I always watch it Christmas eve, and Also watch its a Wonderfull life. I think I could Quote every line from either movie from memory LOL...  ""Are there no Prisons, Are there no work houses?"" LOL!"
414257,Anderson,2009-12-21 20:47:00,32,I think Titanic is a great Christmas movie Just to let people know what cold water feels like Seriously though Hands down Planes Trains and Automoblies Steve and John together brings a tear to my eye.....
414294,steverowbotham,2009-12-21 23:27:00,1800,"I love, in no particular order:  Home Alone, A Christmas Story, Bad Santa, Elf, Planes Trains and Automobiles and Santa Claus"

414308,jaydub,2009-12-22 00:00:00,145,It's a toss up between Home Alone and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation...both classics!
414313,misfish,2009-12-22 00:08:00,29133,"Not many with the older spiritual shows.  Im surprised.  King of Kings is another fav.  I do like the,,,,  Wonderfull world and the Christmas story,Frosty,Charlie Brown,the Grinch (the old one,not Jim Careys.LOL aswell.  Not a big fan of the run off spoofs. IMO,there is no real meaning of the season."
414347,JohnF,2009-12-22 01:32:00,3494,"A Christmas Story - cuz it reminds me of Christmas as a kid, except for sticking my tongue to a post.  It's a Wonderful Life - a real feel good story  Going My Way - for the great music  Not sure of the order but they're my staples.  JF"
414351,walleyejigger,2009-12-22 01:58:00,876,"without a doubt A Christmas Story  when Ralphie helps with the flat tire...
