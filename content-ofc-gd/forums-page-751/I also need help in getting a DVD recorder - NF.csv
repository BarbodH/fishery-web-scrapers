414119,carp-starter,2009-12-21 09:04:00,253,"I also need help in buying a DVD recorder. I know almost nothing about DVD recorders.  I have 2 tube TVs - 1 is 20 inches and the 2nd is 35 inches. And I will not upgrade unless I have to when one TV dies.  I had a VCR to record programs but it died. I am not into watching TV programs but it is nice to record a program and watch another when there are 2 programs that I like and they are on at the same time. I do not need anything more than a basic TV and basic TV programs. I do not need nor want to upgrade to something more that Cogeco has  and wants me to get. I do not need and want HD TV or anything else.  Instead of buying a VCR from Future Shop, I would like to buy a DVD.  dave524's is a good suggestion (another thread) and the price is good.  http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetai...8436&catid=  Will this record TV programs with what I have in TVs and what I have from Cogeco - the most basic stuff.  Another DVD recorder caught my eye when I checked Future Shop.  http://www.futureshop.ca/catalog/proddetai...111&catid=#  From what I know, this unit will record under the same conditions as the above unit except that this unit can also record onto the 160GB hard drive. I also assume that later on one can copy a recorded hard drive program onto a DVD.  How many hours can one record onto a 160GB hard drive on a DVD recorder? I think that being able to record onto the recorder hard drive is a good feature.  I think that only 2 hours can be recorded onto a RW DVD. If one wanted to record 4 hours of programs, one would need a hard drive.  This is one area in which I am almost totally dumb - but this is my problem.  Thank you all.  carp-starter"
414124,dave524,2009-12-21 11:04:00,4508," You generally have the option of recording anywhere from 2 to 6 hours on a DVD RW with a DVD recorder. The 2 hour option will be indistingushable from the original TV program, the 4 and 6 hour option will be more on the quality of your VHS machine, increasing image degradation with increased time. If you can afford it , the hard drive option would be nice though."
414128,Cast-Away,2009-12-21 12:53:00,790,"I have a 160gb recorder and it is good for about 70 hours of recording. I've been recording 4 1 hour shows since the beginning of September and have not deleted anything yet. I also recorded Braveheart, edited out the commercials and burned it to a DVD.  You can also watch a previously recorded show while the machine is taping a new show. The same goes for watching a DVD while the machine records. What I let the best is that I can come home part way through a show that is recording, hit the play button and watch it while it is still recording!  These machines are much better than a PVR because you can play, watch and burn DVD's."

Our first was a expensive Pioneer hard drive unit and that last a little over a year you know just after the warranty expired.We tried another brand and pretty much had the same result, we are now on our third unit a simple DVD recorder and so far it`s still working touch wood. If this one craps out that is it it`s back to a VCR if I can find.  It sounds like you are just into basic TV so a simple VCR may be the best option."

I much prefer the DVD over the old VCR...time slip features, easy editing, etc...can record 4 hrs of ""good"" quality...2 hrs of excellent.  The hard drive option sounds excellent if you don't mind spending a few extra dollars...also the way to go if you plan on recording a large amount while away from home on vacation or any other reason."
414314,carp-starter,2009-12-22 00:09:00,253,"Thank you everyone for your replies. Everyone's post-reply has been very helpful.  I decided to buy the $299.99 unit with a hard drive. It will do a lot more than those without a hard drive.  In my case, $300.00 is the break point. If I can get 4 to 5 years of use and the cost of the unit is not more than $300.00, then I can be happy and call it to be ""disposable"".  The extended warranty at Future is $49.99 for 2 years. I think this is 1 year from Sony and 1 year from Future and so the cost, in my opinion, is high. But I guess I have to buy it because just like lookinforwalleye had posted, stuff you buy DIES - ""just after the warranty expired.""  FYI  I read somewhere about PVRs that you can buy and/or rent.  I live in Oakville and the ""provider"" for just about everything is Cogeco. If I were to buy a PVR from Cogeco (I think it is a PVR and not something else), this PVR is no good  when you move to another area where Cogeco is not a provider. OR if you decided to go with another provider, a Cogeco PVR  would not work.  It is the same problem that we once had with cell phones. If you have a Bell phone and wanted to go to Rogers, the Bell phone would be no good. Now, I think, things have changhed - you can use the same cell no matter who the provider is. If true, be aware of this.  For those people who have a DVD recorder or are converting to DVD but still have VCR tapes, check CTC. They have one VCR for about $55.00 bucks - I might get one since I have about 30 tapes of recorded TV programs.  Again, thank you all for your info.  carp-starter"
