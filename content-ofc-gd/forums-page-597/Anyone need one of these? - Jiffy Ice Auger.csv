532230,Big Cliff,2010-12-27 22:06:00,6899,"Don't you just have to change the auger to go from 8 to 10""?"
532234,Dondorfish,2010-12-27 22:17:00,1000,Yup - thats all I did with my 8 inch Strikemaster - got a deal on a brand new 10 inch auger - and just switched the auger.  Tracker (Don)
532235,misfish,2010-12-27 22:17:00,29133," I would think Cliff the power/cc.would be dif,NO?  Maybe not. Checked out the thier site.  Are the ice drills made for the Jiffy 3500 Series - 30 Series Models and the Jiffy 2500 Series - 70 Series Models interchangeable? Yes. Jiffy has gone to a universal system for ice drills. The 6"", 8"", 9"" will fit 2500 Series and 3500 Series units. The 10"" is for the 3500 Series only.  Q&A FORUM  http://www.jiffyonice.com/EComStore/pages/qanda.aspx"

532272,Big Cliff,2010-12-28 01:46:00,6899, Don't buy it if he won't let you start it first!
532298,Burtess,2010-12-28 03:46:00,901,From the pic on Kijiji it doesn't look like there is a blade guard on it and he has it resting right on the concrete..... I would let this one go inless the replacement blades are had really cheap.... who knows how he routinely treated it?  Burt
