Does anyone know where I can find some to buy???   Also, do you guys think rainbow trout roe will do the trick as a substitute??   Snagmasteral"
531745,canadian_copper,2010-12-25 02:28:00,925,"ONLY PLACE TO FIND BROWN ROE IS IN A BROWN  LOL IF U HAVE TO USE ROE(WHICH IS PERSONALLY MY LAST RESORT) I LIKE CHINNY EGGS. NICE AND BIG. U CAN GET CURED RAINBOW OR CHINNY ROE AT MOST TACKLE SHOPS BUT IF U WANT FRESH YA HAVE TO CATCH ON YOURSELF. OR HATCHERIES SOMETIMES SELL IT I THINK. GIVE RIVERWOOD JIGS A SHOT A THE 3""BERKLEY PINKIES. YOU WILL FIND THEM VERY PRODUCTIVE AND ALOT LESS MESS THEN ROE"

531971,sirfish,2010-12-26 04:41:00,175,Find yourself a donation of juicey steelie skein and tie it into quarter size balls and start from there. I save some skein from the previous year and use it as a start till I get my brown. Good luck.
531976,BillM,2010-12-26 05:12:00,17367,Lower Niagara right now?  Big ass emerald shiners..
531997,WeedLine,2010-12-26 14:15:00,322,I have a freezer full. You can have some for free.
532004,canadadude,2010-12-26 15:16:00,769,"Try Yarn or streamers, they may be going on the winter streamer bite soon, roe slows down in the winter.  Try Pete's tackle they sell hatchery Brown roe 10 bags $5.00. I think they sell it loose awell, still expensive but a better deal."
