532391,Headhunter,2010-12-28 20:04:00,5703,"Hey guys, Heading out to lower the perch population on Cook's and wondering if anyone has been out around Keswick in the last day or so? We'll be walkin out. Any updates are appreciated! Thanks, HH"
532392,irishfield,2010-12-28 20:06:00,26272,Send Terry an email Joe... I think he had thoughts of going out there somewhere & was gonna take the sled..
532393,Terry,2010-12-28 20:06:00,14456,"I don't know but the gilford side is good, when are you going"
532395,Terry,2010-12-28 20:29:00,14456,hey Wayne and I posted at the same time
532396,irishfield,2010-12-28 20:30:00,26272,Yah.. so.. if we could just catch fish at the same time we'd have something to talk about!
532397,Terry,2010-12-28 20:32:00,14456,like that would ever happen   I think posting at the same time is as close as we will get to that
532399,fishnsled,2010-12-28 20:40:00,3520, I'd agree with that.  Just leave Wayne at home and you'll do fine Terry. Just look at the incredible fishing you had on Quinte this fall.....not so much the other day....just sayin'.  I'll be with the crew tomorrow and looking to be heading out on the ice for 7amish.
532410,Terry,2010-12-28 21:15:00,14456,    looks like it is safe
532414,Fish Farmer,2010-12-28 21:33:00,2234,"Terry, Looking at that picture, some people just don't learn. Parking all together on the ice."
532426,fishnsled,2010-12-28 22:45:00,3520,"That picture is just crazy!! Couldn't agree more with you Dave,, especially this early into the season. When will people learn.  :wallbash:"
532429,aplumma,2010-12-28 22:49:00,6896,  Down here in the south we call that a car wash in the making....  Art
532438,Headhunter,2010-12-28 23:07:00,5703,"Thanks for the updates guys! Terry, I'll pm you my cell phone number and I'll even turn the darn thing on! Maybe/hopefully we can hook up! I'll try and remember to bring my video camera as I would like to get video of those cars breakin through the ice!!!! HH"
532441,Terry,2010-12-28 23:13:00,14456,got it   those cars are at the south end of Keswick  there is a ft of ice there and is not deep there at all
532463,LeXXington,2010-12-29 00:06:00,1928,"LOL, sure someone has the picture from a few years ago when they all parked like at yorkdale mall and sunk"
532485,mistyriver1,2010-12-29 01:28:00,600,First time I ever took my son out ice fishing and we walked back to this..same spot..and no my car is not there.   
532488,Fish Farmer,2010-12-29 01:34:00,2234,Good one Art
532489,skeeter,2010-12-29 01:37:00,1907,the shore line where those idiots parked now has a big crack in it and the cars wont be parking there any time soon. when you go down the ramp take a hard left to get out onto the ice. look before you leap.
532559,GBW,2010-12-29 15:19:00,8460,I prefer to park where the ground is solid...  Good luck out there HH and crew.
