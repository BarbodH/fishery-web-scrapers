Once the ball of algae was pulled off it was actually a tag. The tag was orange and it had a phone number on it. I released the perch after showing it to my buddy and I never had anything to write the Phone # down with so of course I forgot it.  Does anyone know if this is an Orillia perch festival tagged perch or a MNR tag. I'm just curious.  BTW there was an open sore where it was stuck in the fish. Didn't seem very good for the perches health.Do these tags eventually fall out?

532482,SBCregal,2010-12-29 01:25:00,688,arent there tagged perch for a tournament starting next fall? tagged fish before then gets you into the tournament with no entry fee?

Years ago when they used to tag the rainbow at the Ganaraska fishway they used small yellow and then eventually clear tags which were attached  through the dorsal fin with a small piece of fishing line and a number on it but not a phone number.This tag was not attached in a good area of the fish and there was a sore on the fish from it.It didn't look like a ministry tag unless they have changed them over the years.
532582,bigugli,2010-12-29 16:49:00,6138,I've seen a couple of tagged fish that have had sores develop around the pin site. I was told it can depend as much on the time of year the fish is tagged. Especially warm water with higher bacteria/algae counts. Glad to hear you had a very productive day on the ice.
