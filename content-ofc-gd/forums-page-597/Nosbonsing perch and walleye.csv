532135,Rod Caster,2010-12-27 14:09:00,5784,"Firstly I'd like to say Merry Christmas to everyone.  Secondly I'd like to say I love ice fishing.  Caught 25 perch on Dec 24 and 25 again on Dec 26.  Caught 1 walleye Dec 24 and 1 again on Dec 26 (notice a pattern?)  The perch action is furious with a swedish pimple or a small shinner.  Caught the walleye with a swedish pimple both nights. It's not a monster but it's a good ice breaker.  Sorry for the crummy shots, first time using the BB camera.        "
