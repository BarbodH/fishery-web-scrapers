531851,Cudz,2010-12-25 16:10:00,2652,All 3 of my kids busted into my room at 5:28 ready to unwrap presents.  That is really early (unless there is fishing involved) Don't even know how they do it considering my eldest went to bed very close to midnight.
531853,Roy,2010-12-25 16:12:00,13728,"AHHHHHH, the power of Santa!"
531854,Spiel,2010-12-25 16:13:00,9065,"I can't but I know Solopaddler can.  My 3 spent the night at their mothers and didn't get up till 10:00, teenagers. But when I talked to  them at 10:30 they sounded like a bunch of 5 year olds!  Kids, God bless 'em."
531862,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-25 16:45:00,2582,"I'm worse then the kids. When my son and daughter where small, I was the one up BEFORE 5:28. The only light on in the house would be the tree lights plugged in and me waiting with a coffee...smiling and staring at the tree...just WAITING for the show to begin  :thumbsup_anim:  Most years the presents where unwrapped well before the sun came up.  Enjoy it while you can...they grow up real fast."

531868,rob v,2010-12-25 17:19:00,535,"Enjoy it while you can guys... mine are 25 and 22 and it just isn't the same.... esp with one on the other side of the country.  Listening to her unwrap her gift over the phone was nice .. but just not the same !  My favourite day of the year is/was Christmas morning - so much excitement, wonder and togetherness.  A wonderful time indeed."
531874,solopaddler,2010-12-25 17:51:00,8605," Yeah, mine were up at 2am, then 3am, and we finally all got up at 4:30.  Cooking now for 16, should be a fun day."

This morning when my wife and I woke up at 8am I commented that this will be the latest we sleep in on christmas day for a looooong time. BTW yesterday he started climbing out of his crib, soon to be bed.  He ""helped"" everyone open their presents. Priceless!  Even if I did get anything, I have everything I could possibly want."
