531895,crappieperchhunter,2010-12-25 19:19:00,2582,Debbe tried crock pot stuffing last year...man does it turn out good. And Debbe always had great stuffing before trying this.Great time saver and now we can have stuffing even if we don't have a bird with it. Only downside is I AM PICKING at it ALL the time. It's about 1/3 gone before it gets anywhere near the table. As a matter of fact that is what I am doing right now...supervising the crock pot to ensure a quality product for Xmas dinner tonight  BTW nice looking bird you got going there.
