532092,limeyangler,2010-12-27 00:55:00,5204,"Great report WM,  Not a bad first fish at all!  I noticed the 'fish-TV' in the piccy....how do you find them?"
532093,walleye_man,2010-12-27 00:59:00,135,thanks man not nearly as nice as your fish but.... there really good you just need to figure out how to keep it still and how to stear it to keep it on your jig
532094,limeyangler,2010-12-27 01:04:00,5204,"  Cool, i'm tempted to get one. There is something called a camera compass (click here to view) which is meant to help steer it."
