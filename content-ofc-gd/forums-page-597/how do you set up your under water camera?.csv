531954,walleye_man,2010-12-26 02:42:00,135,well i have had my underwater camera for a while now but have not been able to figure out how to set it up well so you can watch your jig well fishing and i have watched a tone of awesome vids of people doing this but i cant figure out how to set it all up  anyone want to help me out here? thanks alot chevy
531956,Terry,2010-12-26 02:49:00,14456,"well I drill 2 holes no more then 3 ft apart drop the jig down one and the camera down the other  I then look at the fishfinder to make sure the jig and camera are at the same depth, then I start turning the camera while jigging till I see it it the camera is pointing at nothing I find it make things look darker till something comes into focus ....if you are on bottom things are often brighter then if you are off the bottom because the sand reflects the light"
531958,walleye_man,2010-12-26 02:57:00,135, how do you turn the camera though and have it stay in place?
531959,Terry,2010-12-26 03:06:00,14456,I have what they call a camera compass 
531960,walleye_man,2010-12-26 03:12:00,135,  looks like something that can be pretty easily made thanks alot terry ill try it out tomorow and see how it goes
532008,fishermccann,2010-12-26 15:38:00,655,I have an aqua-view Quad 360 with 4 cameras . In the big rental huts all four of us can watch our speaders at the same time. i would not go ice fishing without it.
532163,GoneFishin,2010-12-27 17:40:00,349,"I don't think there is a really easy way.  Takes a while to set up most of the time but I found angling the camera down a bit helps a lot. I wish I could figure something out, it would get a lot more use if I did."
532228,LeXXington,2010-12-27 22:01:00,1928,Same as What Terry Said. It does take a bit to find your bait once that's done its fun to watch.  I sometimes use the camera to bounce of the bottom to get fish to come over a see
532231,Roy,2010-12-27 22:09:00,13728,There's also a difference between lake fishing and river fishing. They make cams that are specifically designed for current.
