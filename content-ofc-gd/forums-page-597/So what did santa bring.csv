532010,fishing n autograph,2010-12-26 15:54:00,2540,"well, this year I gave my wife and her parents a trip to California so my father-in-law could see his father who is getting over a broken leg. So my wife did a hell of a lot of shopping and my daughter got to go to Disneyland which was awesome.  For me I got a Canon 60D and a Sigma 120-400mm lens"
532012,I'mHooked,2010-12-26 16:16:00,525,I was all excited to pull a Frabill Tru-Trax net out of a big long box shipped from LeBaron...only to find the hoop had been crushed in transit.  At least everyone is healthy!
532018,Joey,2010-12-26 16:46:00,9122,"Well Santa was good to us this year, and along with some lovely jewellery, here are the fishing related items we got.  Paul got me this nifty pair of HEATED boots from Columbia      I got Paul a few musky hats     Some Helly Hansen Under Armour      An Eddie Bauer Folding Shovel and Fog Off sponge      I also got him a few funny posters for his man cave     Love this one!        I haven't drawn in over 25 years, so decided to give it a whirl again and took pencil to paper and drew Paul from a picture with one of his Lakair Musky.     Merry Chritmas All.  May you all have a healthy, happy and prosperous New Year!!!!  Joey"
532022,JohnF,2010-12-26 17:13:00,3494,"No fishing gear, but frankly, I buy what I want when I want it. And I'd rather pick out my own stuff than pretend to be thrilled with what other people pick out.  On the other hand I was thrilled with the Pro 5 Kitchenaid stand mixer I got. With it were a pasta roller/cutter, a sausage stuffer, a meat grinder and a slicer/dicer attachment all driven off the main unit. Pretty cool. I actually picked it all out thinking I was doing it for a gift for our son who has recently, with his gf/partner, gotten into cooking. They were very pleased with theirs as well.  I also got a beautiful glazed cast iron casserole that I've been wanting for a while. I think it's very nifty to be able to use one pot to sear or precook stuff on the stove top and then just transfer to the oven to finish cooking. Besides, good cast iron is the way to go for cooking many things, and it's great exercise lifting those heavy pots and pans.  The other notable gift is a plastic moose that lifts his tail and poops out brown jelly beans when you press down on his back. For some reason my wife doesn't think it looks nice on the coffee table in a grove of stained glass evergreen trees that our son made years ago with a little guidance from my sister.  JF"

I added a Panasonic BLU Ray player and have a pair of Pinacle 10"" 125 watt powered subs and a Yamaha HTR6295 Networked/3D 7.2 channel surround sound receiver on order. They were sold out of the center channel speaker I was after and the rears will have to wait for the bank account to refill some. The subs were 75% off and the receiver was 50% off.
