Thanks"
531932,Stoty,2010-12-25 22:45:00,2910,"The ice around big island is very good! It was a good 5-6"" last weekend so there should be much more than that now!  Always be safe, and check while you head out there, though."

531989,Stoty,2010-12-26 13:10:00,2910,"From what I've seen, people park on the side of the road and just walk down. It's a pretty good hike as well."

532045,Stoty,2010-12-26 19:19:00,2910," As of Wednesday, there was maybe an inch or two of snow, not much at all. Makes for a slippery time though! I bailed a few times, flat out on my   ! lol Spikes are your friends!   Thanks Remo!  Thanks for the tip about Big Island parking.. I hadn't heard of any tickets yet, but now I know!"
