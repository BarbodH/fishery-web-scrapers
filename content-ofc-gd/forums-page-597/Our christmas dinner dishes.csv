531824,splashhopper,2010-12-25 14:24:00,2931,Not a turkey in sight for us. ( my wife is Filipino)  
531832,bassman87,2010-12-25 14:49:00,586,mmmmmmmm looks goood
531834,tjsa,2010-12-25 14:59:00,1578,"Dunno, going to my sister's place later today. Turkey will be on the menu, but it could be anything else after that."
531837,Beans,2010-12-25 15:09:00,3339,Looks good to me...I'm not a fan of turkey...  Tomorrow (Boxing Day) is our big family dinner in a church hall...  Nobody has a house big enough to accomodate 70 (?) people...
531838,misfish,2010-12-25 15:21:00,29133,That works for me splash. Looks yummy.
531848,Rich Clemens,2010-12-25 16:01:00,3131,Is that an 'extra' plate that I see there.
531852,Roy,2010-12-25 16:10:00,13728,"Good looking meal Splash. Funny you mention the extra plate, Rich. My grandmother always had an extra plate at the table...year round as did my mother. I found it to be a nice tradition and have carried on. It's a nice sentiment that anyone could drop by and you have a place for them all set up and ready.  Merry Christmas."
531873,splashhopper,2010-12-25 17:48:00,2931, Yes it was Rich:  It was there for my closest friend that passed away unexpectedly in August. He came to our last 17 Christmas's.
