During fall, these sleek predators will feed  heartily to pack on energy reserves to help them survive winter's  hardships. There are few better ways to catch pike in cold-water  than using big profile jigs, and giant tubes are a particularly  productive bait.  Equipment  101 - Gear Ratios, Thrust, and Drift Socks By Justin Hoffman The more we know and understand about our fishing equipment, the  better prepared we are when it comes time to rely on it. This  insight also allows us to make informed decisions on what will  make the best fit for purchasing products. Here is some advice  for getting your head around reels, motors, and socks.  Cover  Two Zones By Pete Maina Edge fishing is common for all species of fish. Often, some of  the better areas to target in a system that has them - are  distinct breaklines from shallow to deep water. These become  natural travel and cover zones; more specifically, fish often  congregate on more extreme areas of irregular breaklines (sharp  points and inside turns).  Bronzeback  Bonanza By J.P. DeRose For years I was a diehard deep weed line angler for big fall  largemouth bass. I would fish until the end of November,  searching for the greenest weeds in the lake. Some days were  unbelievable, where you would catch 25 - 30, 3 pound plus  buckets, other days you would get 10 or 15. I swore I had the  greatest thing going, that is, until I was invited to fish  smallmouth bass in November.  To  Catch a King Salmon By Tyler Dunn By the beginning of October, rivers that are flowing into the  Great Lakes will be receiving a run of chinook salmon. For many  anglers this is the only time of year when big fish are easily  accessible. There is no need for big boats with 200 horsepower  engines. Instead, a small aluminum or a pair of waders can give  you the means of hooking up with a giant salmon.  Dave  Mercer - First Cast in baseball History!

On  September 21st at 7:00pm Dave became the first person in the  history of the league to ""cast"" (with rod and reel) the  opening pitch, kicking off the game between the Toronto Blue  Jays® and Baltimore Orioles  and  Dave's  Newsest Video!!
