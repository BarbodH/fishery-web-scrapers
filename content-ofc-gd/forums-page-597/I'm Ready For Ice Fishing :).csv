532229,Leecher,2010-12-27 22:03:00,7832," Glad you were able to get out Bruce and baptize the new fish hut     I don't have one and this year, the car is not an option  But I'll try and get a report tomorrow father daughter duo style"
531053,Leecher,2010-12-22 21:44:00,7832,"I just got back from my favorite store and purchased some additional stuff for my arsenal     As if I needed it like my wife always says at this time of year    Yes I do dear  Was able to pickup a box for my spinnerbaits I made      Lots of room left for some more Now onto the good stuff for the up coming season.... well I have basically most of the stuff I need but there's always some additional items that once I glance at them.... it's a must have     Not the most expensive but will compliment very nicely with the stuff I already have  First item to make the voyage to the cash register was a container of  Gulp Alive 1"" black shad minnows, then a package of Mustad hooks Octopus beak in size 4 ultra point, then a container of salmon eggs garlic scent and last but not least, some leader tying material, a spool of Trilene cold weather 12 Lbs mono in blue      Now I'm all set and ready to go I still got to make the leaders but that won't take too long What about you.... are you ready??? Leechman"
531087,Terry,2010-12-22 22:59:00,14456,"I LIKE THE 1"" minnow gulp I don't use spinnerbaits too much in the winter unless I get to Florida  I am about as ready as I am going to get"
531090,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-22 23:07:00,2690,"Jacques, man, I am BEYOND ready!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
531091,Leecher,2010-12-22 23:09:00,7832," Yeah the 1"" minnow Gulp are going to be lethal I think.... first time they make an appearance on the shelves and I noticed them  As for the spinnerbaits.... I don't either  What are you going to be targeting next Terry? Status says 1 1/2 days to go Leechman"
531092,Leecher,2010-12-22 23:11:00,7832," I know Frankie!!!  I just can't wait any longer ""insert shaking emotion here"""
531095,Terry,2010-12-22 23:14:00,14456,I will target perch one or 2 more times I might have to figure out how to hook into some ice-carp come Jan 1 it's lake trout and whitefish and I bit of walleye fishing
531100,Leecher,2010-12-22 23:19:00,7832, Carp on ice would be awesome Terry    I guess chumming with corn will be next on your to do list next time out eh?
531102,Terry,2010-12-22 23:20:00,14456,I don't know  I have never fished for carp summer or winter
531103,Leecher,2010-12-22 23:23:00,7832, There's always a first.... Mike aka MJL can help you out with that species I'm sure
531110,Leecher,2010-12-22 23:40:00,7832,Another item on the shelves that got my attention is the Lindy Darter's    But at $7.99 a piece not including taxes just turned me off  Oh well may be next season
531118,Terry,2010-12-22 23:52:00,14456,is that the one that is something like a rattletrap type bait..if it is I think there are times it could really draw in fish
531122,Leecher,2010-12-22 23:56:00,7832, Yes it is!!!  First time seeing those too on the shelves in the ice fishing section    Lots of different color patterns.... I think we should look at Ben Beattie's post and get what he was using for them monsters he caught
531128,BillM,2010-12-23 00:02:00,17367,"Was already out and laid a nice little beating on some jumbos   Going out again very soon.  A good 6inches of ice where I was, no problems."
531133,Leecher,2010-12-23 00:09:00,7832,"Awesome Bill    Good to hear that you laid a beating on them     Up here, haven't ventured out yet but I suspect we have a good 5"" to 6"" of good ice on the lakes not the rivers  Ottawa R is still wide open    Good luck on your next quest"
531136,BillM,2010-12-23 00:13:00,17367,"Thanks man, I'm just waiting for the whities and lakers this year out on Simcoe.  Can't wait!!!"
531139,misfish,2010-12-23 00:22:00,29133," Hey, hey,hey,dont forget about a crappie outing."
531141,Terry,2010-12-23 00:25:00,14456,my last outing was pretty crappy...LOL  yeah they would be fun to catch too
531146,Leecher,2010-12-23 00:34:00,7832,There's a spot up where I'm going for crappies but don't know if I can stop the car on the side of the road  Only one way to find out is to go by when I return
531156,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-23 01:07:00,2690,"  You betcha!!  I'm with Bill and Terry, those Simcoe lakers/whities are calling my name.  Hoping to get out opening weekend, ice permitting!! Also looking to get out once or twice next week on my holidays!"
531158,Leecher,2010-12-23 01:14:00,7832, Same here    a hole week with nothing to do but fishing   making the leaders as I type this
531175,asdve23rveavwa,2010-12-23 01:57:00,2690,"  Good luck, Jacques!! One thing I didn't mention, is how badly those Quinte walleye are calling my name, as well!!!!!!!"
531180,Leecher,2010-12-23 02:08:00,7832, LOL I'm sure they are waiting for you to drop them a line Good luck to you too Frank
531230,adempsey,2010-12-23 06:09:00,1498,"I like your spinnerbaits.  I have a couple of spinnerbait boxes, but I picked up a binder instead last summer.  I much prefer the binder since it's more compact and has a better shape for storage."
532192,Leecher,2010-12-27 19:31:00,7832, Thanks FishLogic!!!  Yeah those spinnerbait sleeves would be better for storage but I didn't want the skirts to get squished while being in storage over the hard water season  I got all my hard water gear prepped today.... I was going out this morning but the North Westerly winds was too brutal     tomorrow looks better wind wise so I'm heading out for sure   Leechman
532227,bigugli,2010-12-27 21:59:00,6138,We braved the elements today. Had to baptize my new fish hut with some slime. Nice to be out of the wind in roomy comfort.
