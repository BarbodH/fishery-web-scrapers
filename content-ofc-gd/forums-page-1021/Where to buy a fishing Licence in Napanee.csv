193657,Mike the Pike,2008-04-29 01:00:00,3421,Hey folks I will be heading off to Bay of Quinte for 4 days May 16th I need to pick up a licence for my Dad who is 69 but must purchase a licence because he is from out of province.  Can I pick up a licence at CDN tire I expect to arrive in Napanee around 8am. Is there another place I could go to pick up my Dad's licence.  Mike the Pike

209726,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-02 16:57:00,314,I dont think any crappy tire's sell them anymore......  I know in belleville they dont.
209728,largemouth,2008-06-02 16:58:00,112,phoning canadian tire directly never crossed your mind?  Is it your smithwick rouge i still have?
