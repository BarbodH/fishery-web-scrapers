209263,Rich,2008-06-01 12:20:00,3927,Awesome report! Interesting fillet job too.
209609,ccmtcanada,2008-06-02 11:32:00,7971," Now I don't know a lot about using a filet knife on a fish, but I'm pretty sure you're supposed to keep the stuff you cut off....not the rest of the carcass....  Great report Glen!  And you're right....I'd probably have to dunk myself in the lake a few times unless that boat of yours has air conditioning!!  As for Carp...are you able to anchor and stay stationary.  I think the key is to keep your bait perfectly still while they come along and feed.  Carp up here tend  to stay really shallow too...in 3 feet of water...not sure if they feed down in the depths.  At least the bite turned on after the rains and you brought dinner home!  Bly and I have to head down your way one of these years....probably NOT in the summer months though....LOL.  Great report and pics as usual!"
209615,Victor,2008-06-02 11:45:00,1609,Sounds like a great day on the water! Dinner too!  I wonder how it feels like fighting 5 fish on the same line ...

209050,packrat,2008-05-31 17:36:00,93,Nice catch of fish there.    I like the fillet job you do----Dr Diggity Dawg's miracle diet plan  ---very neat
209053,jwl,2008-05-31 17:50:00,1056,"thanks for teasing us with the hot weather, good haul for the day...so you are allowed to have that many hooks on your line down there...5 at a time fish..yee haww"
209054,SlowPoke,2008-05-31 18:03:00,2984,Great report G. I hate those hot sticky windless days when a dip in the water will only make you hotter! -Brian
209057,Mike the Pike,2008-05-31 18:08:00,3421,WTG Dog nice report are you cutting down on your tanning?  Have a tasty supper?Bonne appetit mon ami de Hog Swaller.  81 F. I have never seen that here just in my swimming pool.

209072,ehg,2008-05-31 19:04:00,2666,"Great report and pics, always get a laugh from your reports and learn how to spell. (For ex.  i learned how to spell Hugh Jass)  I guess those white/yellow/silver/striped bass are good eating. What are they more like Crappie flesh or LB bass flesh?  Thanks for post,  ehg"
209073,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-31 19:04:00,0,"Great report. Looks like the fishing has been good to you. Before and after rain can be very productive. Thats one thing about down south. Its great weather but when its hot, its too hot! I was in Florida once in April and I couldn't handle it!! Can you imagine July, August? And this quote scares me!!! ""it's like trying to breathe with your head in a bucket of mud."" and this is in May!!!  Still. At least you got a longer fishing season and I suggest going for a dip every once in awhile. That heat can be brutal!!"
209086,Badger Shark,2008-05-31 19:20:00,291,"Great report, makes me miss my trips down to my mothers place on the Mississippi coast.  I loved the hot humid weather, it was like walking out into a sauna and the water at the beaches was like bathwater. You had to go out to the islands and swim to get any relief.  But hurricane Katrina decided to come ashore and directly hit my moms town with the eye and a 33ft sorm surge so no more town.  She lost everything and moved back here after 26 years.  Apparently the town is starting to recover, I hope she moves back down there, I love the south and the people are great, nice, friendly and relaxed, and laid back.  Always love to read your reports and see your pics."
209090,danbo,2008-05-31 19:25:00,2646,Dang! I'm hoppin' a bus & comin' down for dindin!
209093,SlowPoke,2008-05-31 19:38:00,2984,"Don't be so hard on yourself, I'm sure there are some good Canadians that could tolerate an entire day of fishing with you."

209111,kickingfrog,2008-05-31 20:25:00,8333, I've seen that picture of you with a nice warm sweater on with a nice northern eye... at the end of June!
209132,Tarzan's Jane,2008-05-31 21:47:00,1183,Enjoyed reading your report...love the pics...especially the ones of you waiting  haha...I wonder if Cliff could use that pic...is there not anything you could do while waiting?
209133,Mike the Pike,2008-05-31 21:49:00,3421,  Did you mean this one KF.Its just a sweat shirt he does have some canadian in him after all he married one.  From what I hear about last years Lakair trip I would have been wearing a sweat shirt too.  So dog when you movin toSouthern Ontario.They get less snow than us
209134,wgk36,2008-05-31 21:49:00,69,Great report Dog. A hot day on the water is alot better than an air conditioned day in the office.
209159,fishindevil,2008-05-31 23:59:00,6254,"Good fishin glen !!!!   nice scenery there too,some nice fillets there as well..  ..what time is dinner ??? lol.  .lol   cheers dawg"
