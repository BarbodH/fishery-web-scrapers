209781,crappieperchhunter,2008-06-02 19:01:00,2582,Nice job. The picture looks like Scugog. If it is I guess some survived the die off last year.
209784,Marko,2008-06-02 19:06:00,854,"ahh thats a baby  . Just messing with you man, nice looking fish. They are as scrapy as they come"
209798,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-02 19:57:00,3761, Yup it was Lake Scugog.  Aside of this what would a approx weight be on this. my guess was between 5 and 10lbs. Not to sure.
209896,bassjnkie,2008-06-02 23:59:00,1101,Nice carp. That is an easy 6-7lb carp.  WTG!!!  Daniel www.ontariocarphunters.com
