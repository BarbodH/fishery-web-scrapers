209308,BENNY,2008-06-01 17:27:00,37,"Just curious where people like to order from for various types of tackle, I need to order a couple specific things but was trying to avoid the states(Cabelas/Basspro/Ebay) and BassPro store is quite the drive for me.  Anyone frequent any online sellers with fair prices and decent ship time within Canada/Ontario."

209310,silveradosheriff,2008-06-01 17:38:00,1025,Don't be shy to try Cabellas!
209316,ozaibak1,2008-06-01 18:00:00,401,"I bought a large supply of tackle from Cabela's this year after hearing about it from someone else on the board, and have to say I was quite satisfied with their prices selection and service, I saved a bundle vs buying from BPS here, I would recommend too."
209325,BENNY,2008-06-01 18:58:00,37,  How long did it take to get it shipped here?  And I couldnt find what I need on the Lebarons site G
209326,Gerritt,2008-06-01 19:05:00,6129,what is it you are looking for?  G
209334,Canuck2fan,2008-06-01 19:16:00,1444,I pity you if you have to go the Cabelas route the taxes shipping and handling fees can easily increase the cost by 50% or more...... The days of deals using cross border shipping seem to long gone anytime I price anything from BPS or Cabelas these days.  LeBarons is awesome to order from because in Ontario you don't pay PST most times that covers the bulk of the shipping for me and with gas the price it is not having a three hour return trip is just another bonus.
209335,Guest robw,2008-06-01 19:27:00,0,"What kind of stuff are you looking for? I just bought some trolling spoons and flys from SpoonMaster. Their prices were good and fast shipping. Anything else and you might want to try Cabela's. If you find any more, I would'nt mind checking them out as well."
209338,BENNY,2008-06-01 19:31:00,37, Looking for a couple different types of Blue Fox Vibrax... mailny the Double header and the Musky Bucks.. I see the classic ones on Lebarons site but no other ones....Double Header
209340,Guest robw,2008-06-01 19:39:00,0,"The Vibrax are my favorite lures. I've always been able to get them at Canadian Tire, and my LFS. There has got to be someone near you that either carries them or can order them. See if Blue Fox has a list of Distributors on their website."

209358,BENNY,2008-06-01 20:36:00,37,"Thanks everyone I will try Cabelas or Lebarons if they have it, CTC here Doesnt have them but I will figure somethin out just though I would ask.  Thanks Again  Benny"
209373,BillM,2008-06-01 22:26:00,17367,"If you want muskie baits, you can't beat JB's..  Great selection, decent prices..."
209379,Rich,2008-06-01 22:44:00,3927,"Always dealt well with Cabelas and BPS online. Only problem I had with Cabelas is that they simply left the package on the front porch if we weren't home - which lead to one of the reels we ordered getting stolen (Cabelas was great about this, and sent out another one free of charge). If the order was from BPS they would leave a note saying there was a package at the post office for us.  Either way, shipping was never much."
209401,silveradosheriff,2008-06-01 23:25:00,1025," By decent prices, do you mean the highest prices that you have ever paid?"
209444,Fisherman,2008-06-02 00:37:00,7201,
209471,danc,2008-06-02 01:23:00,4677,Cabelas fan here. They're shipping/brokerage fees are high but I have the option of shopping right at their stores or picking things up at the border.  You'll never get better customer service from anywhere else. Shop carefully and you'll find some incredible deals.
209472,Sinker,2008-06-02 01:24:00,8692,"I've never had any issues with cabelas. Even on large items, I still seem to save a little. The beauty is they have what I want, and the quality is top notch. I don't get much fishing gear there, but almost all my hunting gear comes from them. Its always at my door within a week.  Sinker"
209475,muskymike,2008-06-02 01:28:00,772," Tundra I would have to disagree with you here, its hit or miss with Musky Baits and JB's is by no means the most expensive I have seen.  They have been nothing but great with me. Other then a miscommunication error."
209482,allbusiness,2008-06-02 01:36:00,23,"I found the shipping cost to be way too high at cabela's and BPS, AND they charge you 13% sales tax? I may be wrong but I thought if you only had to pay pst/gst if you bought something in Ontario, outside of ontario you shouldn't have to pay any tax at all. I find it hard to believe cabela's is going to take all that tax they collect from ontario customers and hand it over to the ontario government.  IMO you can't beat Ebay when it come to fishing gear, lures, line, reels, you name it - you can find it a whole lot cheaper on ebay, with the most reasonable shipping rates (most of the time). Just make sure they ship it USPS and not UPS (You have to pay a ridiculous brokerage fee with UPS) with USPS you don't have to pay any duty/brokerage fee at all. AND on Ebay you pay no tax."
