Im with a guide for the opener on a lake near Orillia.  Totally pumped.  Tested out the C3 on the pike opener near Bancroft and loved it.  All the fish that day came on a buckaboo in 13 feet of water over some pretty well grown cabbage in the center of that part of the lake.  I had a great time bomb casting magnum zara spooks and will have to dedicate some top water time this Saturday.  Tested out my entire arsenal of musky gear from shore on lake O.  Had my first birds nest bomb casting a bulldawg early in the day but dont think ill have that problem too often.  I found the show girl the biggest bucktail id throw with that reel. Some good warn weather this week will hopefully turn the fish on.  Good luck to everyone.  Looking forward to the reports Sun/Monday and remember without pics its just a fishing story."
