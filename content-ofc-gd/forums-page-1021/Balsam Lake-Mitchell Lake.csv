209114,mbac31,2008-05-31 20:38:00,904,Just wondering if the slot size is still in effect now that the new regs call for 3 under 18 and one over. I dont keep them anyways but just wondering.

209155,mbac31,2008-05-31 23:15:00,904,Thats what I thought. I was just trying to settle a question that came up. I have misplaced the regs. Thanks man.
209339,bbog,2008-06-01 19:35:00,665,"Balsam and Mitchell restrictions on Walleye - 3 sport, 1 conservation and none between 14.6 and 21.7 inches (and they are all just over the minimum slot size, e.g. dinks!   )"
209374,fishinfool,2008-06-01 22:30:00,366,"While we are on the subject, does anyone know whether or not there is a slot size on Lake Dalrymple. I looked for the Lake but could not find it in the regs. Sorry smalliefisher for taking your thread, just figured it's kind of a similar question.  Thanks"
209463,Rizzo,2008-06-02 01:10:00,4754,"I'm surprised to see these regs on Balsam.  I fished it for musky around 5 times last year and I think I caught incidental pickeral every time.  One was a real brute too, about 7 pounds caught on a 9 inch sledge in the middle of the day.  Seems like there is a healthy population in there, i definitely caught more eyes than skis!"
209582,mbac31,2008-06-02 09:40:00,904,They wont be that healthy in there for that long anymore. I have caught another pike in there. Seems to  me that they are getting in there more often now. That lake is getting infested with Muskie as well.
