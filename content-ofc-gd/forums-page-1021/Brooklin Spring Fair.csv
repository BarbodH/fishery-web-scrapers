209721,GBW,2008-06-02 16:53:00,8460,Hi All.  Well it's that time of year again.  Time for the 97th annual Brooklin Spring Fair.  (I'm only posting this as I am seeing more and more OFC members with Brooklin listed under the location.)  I'll see you at the fair...  Think I'll get in trouble if I try and turn the dunk tank into a casting pond?  Geoff W
