After paying 18 dollars for 2 adult day pass and fishing passes we had to almost fight our way to the water at the lower pond. But after about 45 min. there were only about a dozen of us left. Used spinners with no luck. Then worm and bobber with no luck. But then we went to little wite and green powerbaits with bobber and the tiny sinkers and they just kept hitting like crazy. Cought about 12 - 15 in 2 hours between me and the wife. Nothing real big but we kept three for dinner tonight. Saw a lot being caught on flyrod too. And a few nice ones.

209581,nancur373,2008-06-02 09:22:00,1211,There is a limit of 2 per paying customer. You have to show your fishing reciept to the park guys if they ask. I saw a few people who only kept one and kept releasing the others till they were ready to go and they would keep the last one. If you have 2 keepers in your posession you have to stop fishing.
