209318,rhare,2008-06-01 18:36:00,387,"Since yesterday was a bit of a write off with the weather we had to change plans a bit, waited out the muddy water and loaded up the canoe for some night fishing. After bouncing around bottom with jigs and missing a few small guys we decided to dock the canoe and cast some crankbaits. The fish where rolling and jumping all over the place but seemed uninterested in our offerings. Just as we are about to call it a night Dan gets a good hit. The fish starts to peel down river hummm, catfish?? after a good 5 min battle on a light rod and 6lbs a nice big walleye rolls infront of the dock. We dont use a net so things got a little tense trying to get her ashore but what a beauty. 29"" and 10lbs a quick pic and away she went.     "
