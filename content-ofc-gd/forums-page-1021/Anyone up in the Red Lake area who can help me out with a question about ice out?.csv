200820,[email protected],2008-05-13 00:58:00,33,"Well Connie the recent reports from the pilot on the Viking outpost blog sure are encouraging,hopefully Kevin will just be able to pick us up and take us into camp normally just like any other week without having to do anything different because of ice issues. Late last week i was starting to make plans to do something else during my vacation week because it just was not looking good for the trip but after this recent news it is a full go ahead and i am going to get on that plane to Winnipeg Monday morning no matter what i hear for the rest of the week!"
209977,TennesseeGuy,2008-06-03 01:53:00,957,"My predictions came true, but I was lucky.  We went in minutes after wind blew ice away from the dock at Little Vermilion.  Thanks Mr. Sun and thanks Ms Wind."
209990,danc,2008-06-03 02:03:00,4677,"  Glad to hear that Connie. I wasn't as lucky. My lake of choice was still a solid chunk of ice on our May long weekend. I was forced to fish for Walleyes for the first time in about 20 May long weekends. Despite freezing winds, we did quite well. I enjoyed it. I was fishing a little southeast of you near Ignace."
200691,[email protected],2008-05-12 22:21:00,33,"Thanks for the info grt1,i am just hoping what i heard about Red lake being the last lake in the area to open up is true and that Nungesser is well ahead of what they are seeing there because those pics you took make it look like it will be awhile before that part of the lake is open. Kevin has been saying for almost 2 weeks that he expects ice out on Nungesser to come no later than the 18th,it sure is starting to look like he knew what he was talking about based on the observations of the pilot who went on the scouting mission yesterday!"
200715,BryonG,2008-05-12 22:57:00,52,You will have a great time at Anglers Kingdom. I was up there last fall the end of Sept. Very cool piece of water.Kevin will put you on fish.The only problem you will have is not wanting to come back home
200745,[email protected],2008-05-12 23:25:00,33,"Yes Chef i saw your post with all the pics and it made it even harder to wait for the trip,that is why i have been freaking out so much about this ice situation because i am just so damn ready to get up there and actually fish somewhere where there is a pretty decent chance of putting a 40+"" Pike in the boat rather than these over fished waters around where i live where you would be lucky to get a 30 incher along with a few hammer handles. Just praying for this ice to melt so i can get up there and see what it is all about."
200761,TennesseeGuy,2008-05-12 23:40:00,957,"Ben, believe me when I tell you Kevin will find a way to get you to camp and put you on some good fish."
200762,BryonG,2008-05-12 23:40:00,52,No worries..........All will be fine.......I am headed for the Winnipeg river next week myself.When you cross the border everything is fine..The Fishing Gods will look after the little things
194890,Basskicker,2008-05-01 11:48:00,421,"Check out this link....it shows the ice conditions for Northwestern Ontario on a daily basis.  I'm not sure of the exact location of Nungesser Lake, but this satellite link will definately help. I use it every year to determine when to head up to my secret spot north of Cochrane.

194993,grt1,2008-05-01 15:46:00,638,thats an interesting link and from what ive seen it stops short of the Red Lake area . Nungessor will not be seen on this photo
195053,[email protected],2008-05-01 18:05:00,33,"I don't even know what area i am looking at on that map of the ice,is that Red Lake in the top left of the picture? I see you can look at different pics,maybe someone who knows the area can find one with Nungesser in it."
195054,Whopper,2008-05-01 18:07:00,2174,"I believe the bigger lake on the left is Lake of the Woods, I'm with grt1, don't think it shows far enough north for Red Lake area"
195056,Basskicker,2008-05-01 19:04:00,421,"You are correct it doesn't show Nungesser. Unfortunately there are no satellite images that far north on that site, or any other site that I know off.  That is lake of the woods of the near top left and Lac Seul on the top almost middle.  http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/  1)Google-Modis Rapidfire 2)Under Quick Links choose-Near-Real-Time-Subsets 3)Select any ""Red Square"" on the world map. 4)Enjoy  Jason"
195063,[email protected],2008-05-01 19:18:00,33,Newest forecast is showing 4 to 6 straight days of rain starting on the 9th with highs in the low 50's to low 60's and then jumping up to the low 70's the day after the rain ends. I am no expert on ice but i would think those type of conditions would really put a hurting on it.
198438,[email protected],2008-05-08 06:26:00,33,"Connie,have you heard anything from up that way about the ice? I sent an email to Kevin yesterday, he is still going with the 18th as his ice out prediction for lake Nungesser . The forecast was looking great a couple days ago with a few days in the 70's coming up in a week or so but it has now changed to 50's with a chance of rain and does not look like it will be much above 60 for most of the month. Keeping my fingers crossed,it is gonna be close."
