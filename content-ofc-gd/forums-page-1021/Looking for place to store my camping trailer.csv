209360,Black_Blade,2008-06-01 20:40:00,258,"Just found out that the place where I'm storing my trailer,boat and canoe on Courtice Rd, will have to close up (owner is in a squabble with township).  I'm hoping an OFC member from the Oshawa area might be able to recommend a place to store my stuff for a reasonable amount.  I had originally stored my stuff at a place up off Stevenson Rd north, but he charges a ridiculous amount and I got the impression that my ""well worn"" old camper wasn't fancy enough to fit in with all the other big RV's etc.  It's bad enough that the government has both hands in your pocket these days...without being gouged everywhere else you turn as well!"
209408,forrest,2008-06-01 23:35:00,1032,  There is a place just north of Garden and Martinet in Whitby.  On the west side beside the hearing doctor guy.  They store boats for the winter so they may be worth a shot.    forrest
209548,Sinker,2008-06-02 03:45:00,8692,"There is a place on Hwy. 2 east of bowmanville, west of the 115, on the north side. I don't have a number, but they are easy to find.  Sinker"
209604,Billy Bob,2008-06-02 11:25:00,5865,"I would talk around town and see if someone in your area has some room for your trailer. I have stored my boat in somebody's garage for YEARS without having to pay a dime. This past winter I found a guy that I use to work with that goes to Florida for the whole winter with his wife. I store my boat in his heated garage and look after the house while they are gone. I put the boat in there after they left for Florida and get it out before they come home. It's a WIN - WIN situation for both of us.  Good Luck Searching, Bob"
209624,Ned Devine,2008-06-02 12:00:00,13,There is a trailer / boat storage area on Thornton Road just north of Taunton.  It will be on the east side of Thorton before you reach Conlin Rd.  It is heavily treed in that area so go slow or you may drive right past it.  A friend of mine has stored his trailer there for a few years.
