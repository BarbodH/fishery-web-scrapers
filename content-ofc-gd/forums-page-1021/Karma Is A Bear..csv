209626,scuro,2008-06-02 12:07:00,386,My few encounters with bears have led me to believe that they are not an intelligent animal. Some are very fearful and hightail it as soon as they see or hear humans and others don't. I wouldn't be carrying a gun unless there was cause but what about a cap-gun or firecrackers...or come to think of it a hand held air siren? A dude I fished with recently had problems with bears and he had an assortment of stuff at the ready.

209756,Joey,2008-06-02 17:34:00,9122,"What an awesome report Drew.  Was just wondering tho, at what point when you were slathering on the coconut smelling cream did it dawn on you that it might not be a good idea  Glad to hear to you are okay.  We had many encounters on the townsite in Elliot Lake with black and brown bears.  They sure can give you a scare when you walk into them.  Joey"
209778,Dusky,2008-06-02 18:44:00,310,The deep woods can quickly make logical men pretty spiritual some days.  Ahh man... talk about it....  Good to read your experience!

209858,wuchikubo,2008-06-02 22:12:00,1114,"Always an incredible read with beautiful pics too.  Your skill at story telling is great as like many others have said, it had the effect of bringing back memories of similar moments in one's life to bring your description even closer to visualization.  "

209458,Big Cliff,2008-06-02 01:03:00,6899,"What a wonderful report, felt like I was right there with you! I've had several bear encounters in the bush over the years, but I usually had a gun close at hand. Never did have to use it but it was nice to know that if I did, I could.  Thanks for the report and pictures!"
209465,Greencoachdog,2008-06-02 01:11:00,8163,Great report and pics!!!  You may want to consider carring one of these the next time you're in the Bear Woods without a firearm: http://www.safetycentral.com/safesoundlarge.html
209470,holdfast,2008-06-02 01:19:00,1813,Yup great report.  Thought I was there too.  Wheres my Southern Comfort. (LO)

209486,darsky,2008-06-02 01:45:00,586,MB-why not have a firearm with you that far in the bush?   Just curious?
209487,scuro,2008-06-02 01:46:00,386,Fine report Drew. Ever think about bringing a capgun?  ..or are you thinking about it now?
209495,johnnyb,2008-06-02 01:56:00,3413,wow..that is an amazing report....truly on the edge of my seat! Thanks for sharing
209497,holdfast,2008-06-02 01:57:00,1813,How about a flare Gun.  Would it be considered a firearm?  as some parks prohibit it.  But a flaregun you would not need a licence.  Just a question and thought.
209499,rob v,2008-06-02 02:02:00,535,Excellant report - thanks for sharing your adventure.
209514,Moosebunk,2008-06-02 02:21:00,3970,"Thanks all.  Don't carry a gun because I've never had any desire to hunt. 1.  I'm not a big fan of game meats, although I'd take a moose tenderloin if marinated a few days. 2.  I have my hands full and mind totally occupied with fishing.  To me it's a hobby, turned obsession, made outdoor lifestyle, that so far has never stopped offering peace of mind, something new to learn, something new or bigger to catch, some new place to go that'll be outside and maybe on the frontier, and maybe something to share at times with others.  Hunting would just make my head explode. 3.  I'm a southpaw with a master right eye.  Rifles were never comfortable and I couldn't hit a gofer at 10 feet.   This was the first encounter with a black bear in camp.   This is the second weird encounter with a bear in two months.  On one of the last thursdays in April before break-up, I had to work a nightshift in Moosonee.  The river was thawing out but skidoo taxis were still taking people to and from the island to the mainland.  I went down to get a taxi but no one was working.  I waited.  And waited.  Having to get to work I decided to walk across the river.  It was wet, but thick, with only a couple spots of candle ice, sun was still out.  It's about 2.5km.  Total from home to work 4km.  I rounded the bend of an island about half way across and noticed alot of people standing on the shoreline at Moosonee.  Totally alone out there it wasn't until I got all the way across (much of the crowd had cleared) that someone told me everyone was out because a polar bear had been sited on the river and they all wanted to see.  Guess me being the only one out there on the river as bait, I got lucky and we didn't cross paths.  Next bear I see will be a grizzly."
209522,Tomcat,2008-06-02 02:51:00,395,"As always, thanks for sharing. Your description of your visit with the black bear brought back memories of some trips into Algonquin Park."
209554,wolfville,2008-06-02 03:59:00,396,"Wow, nice read... I can almost hear the bear cracking the stick... thanks so much for sharing."
209566,Mike the Pike,2008-06-02 04:44:00,3421,Thanks again Andrew for a nice read and my favorite pics are the ones with a view from the front of your canoe while going full speed ahead.  I have to admit you had my heart beating fast when you described the bear ouside the tent.  I can remember some 30yrs ago camping with my mom in Northern ontario when a bear shows up and flips moms old blue metal Coleman cooler .Well she would have none of this ran for 2 metal pots banged them together and the bear ran off.  That is different a white fish in your report.
209586,solopaddler,2008-06-02 10:13:00,8605,"That was great bud, you've definitely got a knack for story telling!"
209588,danbo,2008-06-02 10:33:00,2646,Atta boy! That  bear's just curious to see who's trespassing thats all.
209613,wgk36,2008-06-02 11:40:00,69,"Great report!  Great narative! Great pics!  I remember when I was a kid (close to 30 years ago) up in de la Verendrye Park (Northern Quebec).  We were on a fishing and canoe trip with the boy scouts.  After several days  when we got back to the cars, a bear had left his calling card, doing some SERIOUS damage.  I don't remember exactly why (I was just a kid).  Someone must have left someting out that the bear wanted.  Good on you for keeping your cool"
