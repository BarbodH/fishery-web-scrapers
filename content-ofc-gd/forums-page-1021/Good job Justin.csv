Although some may think this is new,it has been around for sometime,just new lures to use with it.LOL Well I guess it depends on the way you did it. I use to throw my baits out and just tap the rod blank and this would make the rod shake/twitch,transponding to the line to the bait. None the less,great report. Thanks for taking the time to do up a great write. Happy hook,n Whats with this ROCKSTAR.He dosent even have a guitar? LOL Nice baits Bud.  AH crap ,almost forgot the boss."
