209526,Mike the Pike,2008-06-02 03:04:00,3421,Well sounds like a nice trip Sonny too bad about the camera.  One you should always use the wrist strap near water.  I also attached a shimano laniyard to my camera and when in doubt that goes around my neck.  Good luck camera shopping look on the bright side cameras are coming way down in price.
