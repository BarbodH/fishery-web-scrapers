210000,splashhopper,2008-06-03 02:22:00,2931,I SKUNKED my daddy tonight. I got one carp and he only got some bites !  Botbot
209501,splashhopper,2008-06-02 02:03:00,2931," Today was Chanelle's first time fishing. What a start she had !  This is the first fish she ever caught. It was approximately 33"" long and 20-25 lbs carp caught in Black Creek off of Lake Erie today.  She caught it on a ""$13.00 kids special"" fishing rod/reel combo from Walmart with a #10 size hook and a bread ball with corn. The fish was so large, it almost pulled her in to the river. She only weighs 52lbs and the fish was approximately half her weight !  Chanelle hooked the fish and due to the the splint on her left hand( from a broken bone in her last Taekwondo tournament) she had to ask for some help from me. She yelled for help and handed the pole to me with EXPLICIT instructions not to lose the fish daddy.  She encouraged me along like an experienced fishergirl! Chanelle got the net out and tried to lift the fish up, but could not. It was just tooo heavy !  Needless to say, she wants to go fishing again real soon !  An hour or so later, she caught a second one, all by herself, about half the size of this one and bigger than the ONLY one I caught today!  waaahhh....  And she is still rubbing it in my nose as I send this to you all.   God bless  Chanelle and Ron Hunter  PS.. she wants to know if she can be an honorary member of Team 8 too?  Here is a second pic to give you an idea of the length and girth of this fish >> "

209535,ccmtcanada,2008-06-02 03:28:00,7971,"Awesome stuff!  Yep...when you start to bring the daughter's fishing, say goodbye to catching them yourself.  I believe their pure spirits appease the fishing gods and they hook up exponentially compared to us parents....hehe.  She's a real cutie....hopefully a lifelong fishing partner!"
209574,The Urban Fisherman,2008-06-02 07:36:00,2050,"oh man that's awesome! congrats to your daughter...can't wait until mine's old enough to wrestle with carp!  Cheers, UF"

209592,splashhopper,2008-06-02 10:52:00,2931," Interesting you say that about us not catching them and they do. I was blown away again by her ability to see the hits on her line when i couldn't. I think i need to egt my eyes checked soon.  She says she wants to go fishing with me again, so we are gonna try to make Monday nights a weekly deal for her and I while she recovers from her Taekwando injury."

209717,bassjnkie,2008-06-02 16:46:00,1101,"Nice carp. Sorry but it's not 20-25Lb, That baby is pushing close 30Lbs easy.  When it comes to measuring a carp for weight, it can't be done. We tried different ways, and the only way is a scale or guess.  Congrats on you Daughters Personal best  WTG!! Daniel www.ontariocarphunter.com"
