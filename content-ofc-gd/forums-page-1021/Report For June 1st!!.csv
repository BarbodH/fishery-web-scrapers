I though dang that was sweet since i wasnt expecting anything and i nearly made the decision to go home and call it a night! Good thing i didnt because just as the sun was setting i put a on a different lure and sure enough wham! The third pickeral ive ever caught and it was visually a new pb! Well looking at the pics now i realize the fish looks a lot happier then me .....! Anyways thought id share the pics, enjoy!!       Jason"
