209295,RobHall,2008-06-01 16:01:00,261,"I used KONK Insect Repellant last year on a mosquito infested camping trip.  DWO was good, but not quite as good as KONK IMO."
209296,forrest,2008-06-01 16:03:00,1032,Does not seem like anyone else is complaining about the repelents melting plastics or scaring off fish (it does scare them off doesn't it?)  I could not find anything on Muskol but I did find some health stuff about Off and Listerine for those interested:  http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/product.php?prod_id=26188  http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/product.php?prod_id=47700  forrest
209313,Big Cliff,2008-06-01 17:46:00,6899,"Isn't anything safe anymore? That was some interesting reading, thanks for the links!  At least with the Listerine, you don't spray yourself with it just the area around you."
209317,Cookslav,2008-06-01 18:02:00,1457,"In bad bug conditions... Long pants and a sweater with Deet spray around my Neck, wrists, and Ankles. Have a good hat on, and smoke a cigar. Or if its hot get a bug jacket and do the same.  That will pretty much cover you, but also if your out for more then 2 days...incorporate lots of Garlic, leeks, and onions into your meals, and be sure to drink lots of Beer! It works incredibly well, so you won't need the Deet after about day 2... This method works so well that It actualy repells women as well LOL!  But seriously... The coverage of the netting keeps you safe, while the deet keeps them away from any openings in the suit, and the smoke from the cigar keeps 'em out of your face. The natural odors you'll sweat out after 2 days will then take over for the deet. But if your only out there for a weekend, the deet will do. Nice thing about this method is you don't need much deet either....just a bit round the edges. Some guys I know will spray their hat, and pants around the waist as well but, they also have been known to have holes in their hats, and pants LOL!"
209323,Beans,2008-06-01 18:54:00,3339,I tried the listerine method and didn't find it very effective while working in the garage...nice minty smell but that was it !...Used to use a can of no-name flying insect repellant that did the trick but was leery of breathing that stuff...  I wonder if being diabetic...sweet blood...makes me more vulnerable to insect bites...  Any other diabetics find this ???
209324,MCTFisher9120,2008-06-01 18:56:00,3761,Besides the bug spray i will stand in the smoke from the fire or walk around the site with a burning stick. THEY DONT LIKE SMOKE. But not always good cause we generally start a fire after fishing.
209332,Gerritt,2008-06-01 19:13:00,6129,"For whatever reason bugs are attracted to me, more so then those around me.. must be my good looks  The reason I like the stuff that Joe and Art have is that VERY little goes a very long way and most of it actually winds up where you put it.. vs those aerosol cans where maybe 20% lands where you spray it.  The difference between the two is the higher the concentration of DEET the longer it protects you from bugs... it is not any better at repelling them, it just lasts longer.. while you are respraying again with about 20% actually getting where you want it I an good for the night..  G"
209361,Black_Blade,2008-06-01 20:58:00,258, I think you are supposed to use the original variety (the stuff that smells like hospital disinfectant)
209477,holdfast,2008-06-02 01:31:00,1813," Yup, just make sure you wash your hands, otherwise you will melt anything plastic.  Reel handles, rod handles, line, plastic worms, SKIN"
209571,Live2Fish83,2008-06-02 05:07:00,26,Muskol all the way!!!
209715,Danubian,2008-06-02 16:40:00,65,"I honestly don't remember what brand of insect repellant I use - it may be Muskol very well as Deep Woods Off. But it's been a while since I stopped applying it directly on my skin. (That was because I once put spray on my hands and then smear it on my sweaty face and neck; 10 minutes later I could't feel my lips, like I've been to the dentist.) I do camp quite a lot and I prefer to wear a bug jacket and a pair of long pants -microfibre like texture. I still spray my clothes and my cap, but I try to minimize the skin contact. Other things I noticed: - smoke ""baths"" work well (even after showers, because it neuters the sweet scents of shampoo/soap) and smoke is a good antibacterial. - eat garlic at least 24 hrs in advance; your sweat becomes quite repellant for insects. (For avoiding the garlic breath, I use to just cut the garlic in pieces large enough just to not get choked with and swallow them with beer/wine/juice, just like when taking medicine. Actually I like the smell/taste of garlic, but I want to spare the people who don't.)  Mosquitos don't bother me much, hate the blackflies, but the odd deerfly bite could get me a swollen foot -if the bite was in the foot/toes area. It lasts for a couple of hours and then is fine."
209724,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-02 16:55:00,314,Vaporub  works like a champ.!!!!!!!!!!
209736,anders,2008-06-02 17:15:00,1168,There is a product we get across the river in Sault Michigan.  Has over 90% deet.  Dont need much of that stuff and works awsome.  I heard that bugs are attracted to bananas?  Anyone else heard of this??
209739,dannyboy,2008-06-02 17:18:00,367,"A bug jacket if the bugs are bad.  DEET is nasty stuff, unless you are in areas of bug borne diseases, the relief is not worth the side effects. In Canada manufactures have been forced to reduce the concentrations of DEET to less than 30%, it cannot be recommended for use on toddlers or infants and only recommend limited use on children under 12 using concentrations of 10% or less.  Dan"
209755,highdrifter,2008-06-02 17:33:00,2534,Hard to believe.. I was introduced to this bug remedy during my last Algonquin trip...  Mouth Wash!! Scope being the preferred brand..  Makes the bugs go bu-bye and leaves your skin feeling fresh and tingly!  cheers HD
209758,Dabluz,2008-06-02 17:40:00,701,"Yep....Dannyboy is right, DEET concentration is limited to about 34% I think.  Funny thing about DEET.  No matter what the concentration is....it's effective.  The concentration of DEET determines how long it will last.  The 5% stuff is just as good as the 100% stuff....you just have to apply it more often.  Usually, you only need insect repellant for a short period anyway.  95% of the time, I use something like Skintastic or Skin so Soft which has about 5% DEET.  I did use some military spray one time about 25 years ago.  It was in spray form and was close to 100% DEET.  I accidentally sprayed my lips and they were numb for the whole day.  The stuff was meant for clothes only.  I still have some old bottles of OFF, Muskol and ZZZ.....100% DEET but rarely use the stuff.  However, I most often carry the stuff because there can be times when it just has to be used.  In an emergency situation....like when you have to change a tire and you are nearby a swamp or when you have to walk to civilization after a breakdown.  The big problem with this stuff is the fact that my skin gets all dry....my ears turn into dry leaves.  And.....it STINKS like old dog breath.  There was a time when Noxzema had a suntan lotion/deet combination.  I used that for a few decades.  Great for keeping the insects away, great smell, skin felt soft and non-oily and it did work as a sun protector too.  However, no such product exists any longer due to the fact that sun protector is supposed to enter the skin while DEET is not supposed to enter the skin due to it's toxicity.  I live in the Saguenay Region of Quebec.  The whole area is litterally covered in small bodies of water.  I rarely have to use insect repellant because once out on the water, there are few insects.  It's just when it's time to load the canoe on the vehicule in the late afternoon or evening that the bugs are at their worst."
208950,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-31 13:24:00,3761,Saw in another thread something about bug spray. Well everybody gets bugs when you are camping or out on the water so share what is your most favorite bug spray. I have tried Deep Woods Off and it works fairly good for me but this year i am going to give Muskol a try. It has 23.5% Deet in it.
208951,Gerritt,2008-05-31 13:27:00,6129,Max-Deet...   The stuff the rednecks gave me two years ago  G
208952,forrest,2008-05-31 13:28:00,1032, none....yep...no bug spray for me.  Too many chemicals and they scare away the fish.  That and after the first 20 bites of the season they don't bother me.  I say...suck it up or wear a skeeter hat.  forrest
208954,jwl,2008-05-31 13:35:00,1056,"me too, as little as possible...if I do put some on it's most likely the Off Skintastic kind I have for the kids....but if I am feeling romantic and want to put out a more manly scent it's Muskol all the way  .   I generally try not to use it at all really. They don't usually bug me too much..if it's bad for skeeters at night time I generally just roll myself around in the camp fire smoke for a bit....don't shower for the whole time camping/fishing  and sit beside as many girls as you can, the bugs like biting them better than boys....seems they are warmer than us so the bugs are more attracted to them."
208955,danbouck,2008-05-31 13:37:00,4380,I've used Deep wood before but am trying Muskol this year
208968,Clampet,2008-05-31 13:56:00,1947,"I can remember around the late '60's Off did not work, but Muskol did, so I became a Muskol customer. I find the spray convenient and less messy."
208982,jwl,2008-05-31 14:17:00,1056,Benadryl and vodka highballs...after you have about 6-7 the cherry taste starts to grow on ya
208990,Clampet,2008-05-31 14:31:00,1947,Is it any good fer a bug repellant? 
209004,darsky,2008-05-31 14:50:00,586,bounce
209005,bassjnkie,2008-05-31 14:58:00,1101,"military issue bug spray, work good.  Daniel"
209011,Zubris21,2008-05-31 15:32:00,563,"I don't use any at all!  I do a lot of camping but usually don't get into black fly swarms so it's only mosquitos I have to deal with and they don't bother me much.  On the other hand my recent trip to Bay of  Quinte saw quite a few bugs, and the three other people I was with tried out the Burt's Bees all natural bug spray.  They were very happy with how it worked and it actually smelled nice compared to many other bug sprays."
209018,jwl,2008-05-31 15:48:00,1056,"  well if you do get bit, after a few you won't feel it, and no swelling or itching at the same time"
209067,BillM,2008-05-31 18:45:00,17367,"Muskol, the old stuff I've had in my tackle box for years.  You know, the stuff they can't sell anymore"
209105,Big Cliff,2008-05-31 20:03:00,6899,"I have not tried this yet but a couple of friends have told me that it works: I am not a great fan of some of the chemicals in the commercial bug sprays.   The best way of getting rid of mosquitoes is Listerine, the original medicinal type. The Dollar Store-type works, too. I was at a deck party awhile back, and the bugs were having a ball biting everyone. A man at the party sprayed the lawn and deck floor with Listerine, and the little demons disappeared. The next year I filled a 4-ounce spray bottle and used it around my seat whenever I saw mosquitoes. And voila! That worked as well. It worked at a picnic where we sprayed the area around the food table, the children's swing area, and the standing water nearby. During the summer, I don't leave home without it.....Pass it on.   OUR FRIEND'S COMMENTS: I tried this on my deck and around all of my doors. It works - in fact, it killed them instantly. I bought my bottle from Target and it cost me $1.89. It really doesn't take much, and it is a big bottle, too; so it is not as expensive to use as the can of spray you buy that doesn't last 30 minutes. So, try this, please. It will last a couple of days. Don't spray directly on a wood door (like your front door), but spray around the frame. Spray around the window frames and even inside the dog house if you have one. Also can be used to dab any bites you receive. It will stop the itching quicker and go away faster."
209140,Guest robw,2008-05-31 22:12:00,0,Rapala X-Rap....??
209149,Mike the Pike,2008-05-31 22:29:00,3421, I am with Bill good old Muskol but remember no deodorant no scented soaps or shampoos this will make one hell of a difference.
209172,Tarzan's Jane,2008-06-01 00:35:00,1183,Skin So Soft from Avon...the oil...yep it works.  Have heard about the Listerine from quite a few people too...haven't yet tried it though.
209176,crappieperchhunter,2008-06-01 00:48:00,2582,"If you are sitting out at home...plug in a fan!!! Seriously...it works real well. Debbe and I discovered this a few years ago while trying to sit out one evening and enjoy some time on our front porch. Just like a windy day...lotsa wind....no bugs. However 2 fans would be optimal as a few of the little buggers figure out how to sneak up on you on the leaward side of the fan!!!  Other then that go for the highest DEET you can get, but be warned this stuff is NOT good for you. Better to plan outdoor time around those little buggers schedule/peak season's"
209189,danc,2008-06-01 01:49:00,4677,I too would rather get eaten alive than spray any concoction over my body.
209204,kennyman,2008-06-01 03:26:00,737,"We use Deep Woods Off when we're camping and it seems to work great. We try not to use it too much, but sometimes you just have to. I think I'll buy some listerine and try it. Does it work on coons too?"
209208,FinS,2008-06-01 03:37:00,463,  i think i might try this out and a plus i will smell minty fresh lol but serious i will test it at let yous all know how well it works
209256,Rich,2008-06-01 12:03:00,3927,"I'll only use it if the mosquitoes are REALLY bad, and I use Muskol. I find it to be the best of the commercial sprays."
209270,Sinker,2008-06-01 13:51:00,8692,Can't beat a good bug jacket!!! Best thing since sliced bread!  Sinker
209273,Black_Blade,2008-06-01 13:55:00,258,"Hasn't government ruled that all these products have only a certain amount of deet in them now?  I recall as a kid when Muskol first came out and it worked amazing...then again what did we have for comparison...the old original OFF (remember them dumb commercials of sticking your arm into the clear box with the mosquitos? LOL)  My dad was convinced that the stuff actually attracted the bugs....lol.  My dad used to have a jar of some kind of cream with oil of citronella in it.  The smell of it will forever take me back to camping and fishing trips with dad...but effective?....nope.  Now that regulations have put all of the bug repellents pretty much on the same level, I don't imagine there is much real difference (at least of the ones that rely of deet).  For the record tho...I have always used the Deep Woods OFF (once I got over the trepidation from using anything from OFF after the orange stuff)  I found it worked best and now that they have the no scent variety, even better!  (Remember the great commercials for Deep Woods....where the people would be out in the middle of nowhere and that deep voice saying DEEP WOODS would make them look around....)"
209289,Mary Penny,2008-06-01 15:38:00,5,"I also think Muskol is the best spray on the market, however, for those that don't like the chemical, taking 100 mg of vitamin B1 every day (starting well before the season) helps repel mosquitos and those that do bite, the bite itself is small and heals up right away.  I've done this the last several yrs and it works noticably well.  Mary Penny"
