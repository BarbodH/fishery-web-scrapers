209769,spoonman,2008-06-02 18:00:00,103,I managed to get out last week with Mark a client of mine from the States. It was Marks first time fishing Lake Ontario ever. The water was cold a mere 48degrees but the fish were there. The key to our success was fishing in the deeper water. We ended up 5-9 with all fish weighing between 14-17lbs. Mark with his first Lake Ontario Salmon  Mark with about a 15lb spring salmon   Another nice fish mark landed fresh silver great fight   Mark dockside with a couple of nice Salmon to take back home   Cheers Al
