209389,gone_fishin,2008-06-01 23:12:00,481,"under your pictures (in photobucket) there will be a line of code that says ""Direct Link"".  then when you are ready to post, use the ""insert image"" button (it has a picture of some hills and the sun, and it is directly below the font dropdown box). Copy the the ""direct link"" from your photo and paste it in the ""insert image"" box that appears.  and voila! you have posted your picture."
