I've tried them all at one point, all were safe and did make a difference, some small some big.  Something like this (or google for others) http://www.speedwaymotors.com/m/858_Truck-...ance-Chips.html  Be sure to research the chips if you decide to go that way.  Some require other engine changes."
209055,oncogene,2008-05-31 18:07:00,154," That will not be the future.  Hydrogen & Oxygen..... sounds free.... but no, not really.  Where do u get the hydrogen & oxygen? From electrolysis of water. What do you use to electrolyse water? Electricity. How you get electricity? By burning gas & coal and what not.   So in reality, all hydrogen is really another form of transporting energy, it's NOT a new energy SOURCE.   Same thing with all these ""bio-fuel"" that is make from corn or whatever. It's stupid. Sure it's cleaner. But it's not another new energy source at all. To grow corn what u need? Fertilizers. What does fertilizer come from? Oil. Not to mention all the machinery and labour, all of which cost alot of energy, to grow and maintain the crops."
209092,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-31 19:37:00,0, Really?Can't you get electricity from a battery? Also solar energy may be another form of energy not required by burning coal.  Hydrogen is not only not a new energy source? Its the oldest known energy source. The sun has been burning off it for millenniums.  And you don't need machinery to mine coal or oil and convert it to energy??  And fertilizer comes from oil???  All I know is what we have now is obviously not working. Can you imagine growing your own fuel in your backyard? There are countries where farmers are allowed to run their vehicles off of vegetables. But they are not allowed on main roads. Probably because they lack the umph to get them up to high speeds. I think ethanol has potential to make up for the umph of gasoline.

209138,Canuck2fan,2008-05-31 22:07:00,1444,"A perfect cheap renewable source of energy to convert water into to hydrogen is tidal power. You then use the hydrogen to produce more electricity then you use electric cars.... Two problems it cuts out the oil companies so it ain't going to happen and the second reason is it would take a lot of co-operation between the provinces to run the extra power grids and we are just too stupid as Canadians to worry about ourselves first. The coastal provinces could produce the electricity. Quebec and Ontario could make the vehicles. Alberta, Saskatchewan could still export their oil to the U.S. Manitoba well they still have the peg and polar bear tours in Churchill so they are covered. All the technology is available it all works so what is the problem holding us back.. Lack of leadership.

208227,Guest lundboy,2008-05-29 20:39:00,0," America may have been number one, but the vultures are swooping in, look who's buying up your (as well as ours) roads, power generation, and water plants as well as other infrastructure to collect the debts.... Europe and Asia!  Let's not forget that oil is bought and sold in U.S. Dollars which is worth about 1 cent now compared to 1917 (since the creation of the private Federal Reserve Bank) due to inflation.  The U.S. Dollar has lost about 60% of it's world value since the intro of the Euro. This is a major reason why oil prices have risen so drastically recently despite popular belief that OPEC is causing it.  Remember every time the world private central banks (including the Bank of Canada) pump 10 or 50 billion into the world economy to pump up the markets and bail out failing banks, that money comes out of thin air, indebted against the tax payer as a bond. That bond gets sold on the bond market mixed with junk bonds these days, and is indebted to the tax payer at interest to the private central banks.  They make the money back twice by lending fiat currency credits (with next to no backing, called fractional reserve lending), and then selling the debt (bond, from the word bondage) to other countries.  By pumping cash into the economy, the dollar, your savings etc. gets watered down.  And the amount you have to pay for things goes up due to the weaker purchasing power of the dollar.  That is basically what inflation is.  The Dow maybe sitting at 12,000 but in actual reality it is closer to 6,000 because of the weakness in the dollar.  This is an example only (not real figures) e.g. $100 billion currency in the US economy, quart of milk = $2.00 Pump in another $100 billion, quart of milk = $4.00  By doubling the currency in circulation, the dollar is devalued by half.  If you look at the devaluation of the US dollar, as compared to the increase in price of a barrel of oil, there is an almost opposite correlation. This is why Iran, Russia, Venezuela have now refused to trade oil in dollars.  That is why OPEC is now considering it, but they are too controlled by Big Oil and the US/UK to attempt it.  This is also why there is so much saber rattling at Iran.  Blindly saying America is #1, and refusing to see the possibility of a country on the verge of collapse, is not a wise choice.  Everything the governments do is pretty well based on three phases, PROBLEM, REACTION, SOLUTION  Right now we are in the problem, almost reaction phase (people are getting reactive to the price of gas),  unfortunately the SOLUTION phase will not be liked.  Ok. I'm done lecturing, we all really need to look at the real reasoning behind what we are seeing now, and will see shortly."

208373,allbusiness,2008-05-30 02:04:00,23,"I heard gas prices are expected to rise up to 4$/litre over the next 5-6 years, which is possible, I think they are paying close to that over in europe. It's likely too that the bank of canada will raise interest rates back up to 10 - 14% to help stop all the inflation, (which would hopefully lower the price of fuel)  Could you imagine if your mortgage renewed at 11% instead of 5% AND you were paying 4$/litre for gas?  I might pull a John Denver and bury gas tanks in the back yard and start hording gas."
208399,OhioFisherman,2008-05-30 02:45:00,6623,"Fish Farmer it may help but my opinion more of a gimmick. Back in the old days some engines had some lets say less than ideal air flow characteristics. One of the trips for the hot rodders was to port and polish the heads(exhaust side, intake side can cause fuel mixing problems) match a set of headers to the exhaust ports because stock exhaust manifolds on most cars were pretty restrictive but a lot quieter.  A lot of these may have been corrected by trying to get smaller engines to do more for fuel economy."

Needless to say there was a steady stream of traffic screaming by me I did not pass one person even the truckers were passing me, so my conclusion is that people are not interested yet in saving 20-30 percent on their fuel bill by slowing down a bit.  My driving style has changed, with my daily business vehicle(Buick V6) I can get over 35 MPG on the hwy which is pretty good for a full size car. With my truck (Durango V8) I can 23 MPG on the hwy which I think is pretty good for that type of vehicle. If I could only figure out how to get 20 MPG out of the Yamaha.
