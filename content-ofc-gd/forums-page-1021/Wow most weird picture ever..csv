208941,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-31 13:06:00,3761,Thought i would share this picture. I'm not sure if it's real
208943,Gerritt,2008-05-31 13:10:00,6129,I think this picture shows up here weekly LOL..  smaller fish inside the larger ones gill plate.  G
208945,Tarzan's Jane,2008-05-31 13:12:00,1183,First time I've seen it....thanks for sharing Mike.
208946,Beats,2008-05-31 13:14:00,543,Yeah this pic and the one with the (Dutch?) guy sitting in a boat holding a massive pike are fascinating to people for some reason and get posted many times each year for the first time
208948,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-31 13:19:00,3761," Is it really, man thats some pretty neat camera work....i thought it had 2 bodies for a second. This was my first time i saw it also."
208956,danbouck,2008-05-31 13:38:00,4380,  Wasn't that just caught in Ontario
208979,Rizzo,2008-05-31 14:14:00,4754,"what really surprises me is not the little guy in the big guys gills, but the fact that there are people who have never seen this before! Like others have said, its this one and the big (I believe) Italian pike that keep showing up about 5-10 times a year."
208996,Spiel,2008-05-31 14:35:00,9065,"  ....Camera work? I believe what has happened is first a small pike was tied to the end of a small rope and tossed over the side of the boat. A second larger pike subsequently followed then dragged around in the water beside the boat, the force causing it to slide down over the head of the smaller pike. Admittedly though this does show up frequently."
209014,Zubris21,2008-05-31 15:36:00,563,"First time I've seen it as well....  I don't really see how one fish is inside the others gill plate, looks like there are 2 distinct jaw lines.  Looks to me (based on the line between the 2 fish) that this picture has been photoshopped to make it look like conjoined twins or something."
209052,MCTFisher9120,2008-05-31 17:45:00,3761,O ok i see it now lol.
209097,CLofchik,2008-05-31 19:45:00,854,"Lol, I remember seeing that pic on another forum the first time around 1997 or so.  NOW, for a truely original pic check out the carp I caught in Hamilton yesterday, half his face is missing and he still picked up a bait & swam away fine, DANG.  "

209196,Tinman,2008-06-01 02:43:00,376,"al right then, i can now taste supper, for the second time!"
209199,xrap,2008-06-01 03:14:00,683,"I've been out to lake erie few time this year and eevry trip I seen a carp with soem kind of diseae on it slowly swimming and dying, and just last night I saw a few minnow witht he same thing. Here in this picture you can't see it clearly but thiers a big white tumor on it, kinda what the carps had.  "
209364,Rich,2008-06-01 21:17:00,3927,Typical Hamilton Harbour.. lol
209395,Weeds,2008-06-01 23:19:00,782,I feel naive in asking but is that Carp pic for real?? I've never seen anything like that.
