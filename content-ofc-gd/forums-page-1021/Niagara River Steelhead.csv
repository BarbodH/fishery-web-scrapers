Rain poured down once we got there @ 6am, which made for some intense fog in the morningââ‚¬¦    From there on it was clear skies until mid-afternoon. Hit a few fish in the first couple of drifts within the first hour, Then we put down the bottom bouncing rods and picked up the centre pins for some amazing Niagara center pin action! We set up around 9 and it was on, nailed fish for the rest of the day. We hooked up to 28 fish in 5 hours between the 3 of us on the pins, biggest was pushing 9 lbs. Bringing them in was tough with the strong current, but we managed.         messin with the fisheye lens..    Around 3 the storm came in and kicked us off the river. rain hurts when your roaring down the niagara..    We had a great time out there with Paul. If you havent hit the niagara i highly recommend Paul from www.castadventures.ca, he knows his stuff, looking forward to next time Paul.   Take Care, Joe"
