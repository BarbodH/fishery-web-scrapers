We will be targeting pike and pickerel for the most part, but we have heard that there are lake trout in the lake.  We were going to try trolling for some lakers at some point.  I was just wondering if anyone has ever fished Lake Herridge for Lakers before?  If so, were you successful? How big were the fish that you caught?  Do you have any tips for success? (any tips for pike or pickerel would be appreciated as well).   Thanks."
