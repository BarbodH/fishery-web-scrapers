234277,joonmoon,2008-07-30 02:58:00,528,My buddy Jimmy and I were down and fishin @ Port Maitland by 9:30am today. We trolled crankbaits upstream a few kms and paused to fish with jigs/grubs worm combinations several times but the heat and lack of wind was unbearable so we continued trolling. By early afternoon we had what felt like a few bites but nothing to show for it. Switched to a worm harness and began trolling back to the launch downstream. We were about 1 1/2km from Erie when he had a nibbler and shortly there after...landed his first eye of the season. Good job by the guide finally...lol.
