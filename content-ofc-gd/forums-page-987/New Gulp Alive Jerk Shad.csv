234210,e-z-out,2008-07-30 00:05:00,1052,Now whos going to go and buy one and tell us all about it
234240,Leecher,2008-07-30 00:53:00,7832,Ummmmm....new container design....hope it doesn't leak like the other ones  Leechman
234242,MrMike,2008-07-30 00:55:00,153,if they dont leak they last to long
234250,bassmaster4,2008-07-30 01:00:00,801,LOL theres a color called nuclear chicken glow
234251,Mike the Pike,2008-07-30 01:08:00,3421, You're so right Jacques since I first bought my Gulp Leeches I have been leaving them at home because that container leaks and when the juice ends up in the boat it smells like 1000 year old fish.  $20.00 for smelly leaky juice I feel berkely should send us all a replacement leak proof container.  Its a rip off and on not one Walleye on those leeches.
234256,Leecher,2008-07-30 01:32:00,7832," Mike, have you tried the 3"" minnow grub in the chartreuse color?? I have a bucket and almost near the end now.... bought it in may just before opening day and caught some eyes with them.  What I do is add a real leech to my jig to give it extra flavour.  So far so good...been lucky.  When I ran out of grubs will use the juice and add it to the Gulp packs I have.... the ones that say x400 on them. For smallies, I use the 7"" minnow worm, cherryseed.....a real killer.  Leechman"
234270,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-30 02:28:00,3761,"O im not going to get this, and i most likely will never get a ""Gulp Alive"" product again. Just thought i would share the new design as i was browsing around on the bass pro site. I already have regular Gulp jerk shad's. I just think it is kind of stupid the design. It looks like the same lid as before. Now there is just more juice to splash around and leak. As a side question, PM me anybody and tell me how the Jerk Shad works for bass. I have the solid white color in the 5inch. Not planning on getting more would just like a little info on how to properly work this bait.....if anybody has used it and does not mind."
234271,Cudz,2008-07-30 02:33:00,2652,"Many pro bass guys use the jerk shad as their go to bait.  They run it texas style with big hooks and cast over weeds twitching it like a hard jerk bait.  If the fish are deeper, they will use a weighed 5/0 worm hook so it gets down a bit.  I have a bunch of them but am reluctant to use them because in the same situation I would probably go for a slower presentation like a senko.  One day when I have more time I will try them properly."
234436,Rich,2008-07-30 18:51:00,3927,"Can't stand that Gulp stuff, never caught a fish on it anyway. Their senko wannabes were the worst. Sunk like a rock and no action."
