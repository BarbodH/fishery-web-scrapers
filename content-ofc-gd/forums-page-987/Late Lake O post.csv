233507,GNODDY,2008-07-28 01:42:00,163,Went out with Lloyd and the new U & Me boat last week for an evening of Chinooks. Lloyd was telling me how the boat was so much better to fish from bit I didn't believe him until we were out. Perfect setup for some monster Chinooks. Went 3 for 7 that night and we were only out for a few hours. Some pics below of the fish. I can't wait to get out on Quinte in that boat. For anyone who needs a good charter for Lake O out of Port Hope of Quinte give Lloyd a call.  http://www.stevemorissette.com/uandme/index.html      Cheers
