My favorite picture as you enter Belle River   Well the day starts out early for our guys getting cups of bait ready for the kids thanks Marty Cody and John I guess George was looking for new bait colors LOL    I got to have the honers of measuring alot of the fish and watch the kids come with ther ecatch and the huge smiles. Marty and Terry were also getting slimmed but it was not the good kind sheep head and rock bass were in huge numbers. Here is Marty measuring the 20"" sheep head that was the big fish for the day.     we had teens out who were fishing for the first time and had a blast here is one of them wit hhis first fish ever.   the kids were everywhere fishing any where the water was you could fins some one at one point or another this dock was not bare for long this was first thing in the am.    the measuring table was also a big hit.     yes I would have had the same look on my face if some one like that asked to take my picture LOL :mrgreen:   this was a blast no mom or daughter wanted to hold the big fish.   Well now for the meat of the day all the kids were done fishing and ready for some prizes we had alot to hand out so I will only post a few pics.       Not bad first fish of your life and you get a new rod   all the kids now need to get there sugar rush so we gave out the grab bags and candy   The belle River Chapter of Muskies Canda also donated two prize packs for both boys and girls here is a picture of the young guy but the girl must have left before we had time to get a picture with her..    Last but not least this could not happen with out all the help from the members of the Belle River chapter of Muskies Canada and the Belle river BIA helpers thanks to all here are the Belle river members that made it out.

234022,GBW,2008-07-29 13:36:00,8460,Great job EVERYONE!!!!
234175,Handlebarz,2008-07-29 22:32:00,3790,thanks for the kind words these events are where the future lies if kids events did not take place then there would not be alot of seeds planted to keep them interested we get alot of people that come up and thank all of the people who run these events and let us know this is the only chance they get to fish???????? I dont understand because the fish are in the same place every weekend and the place is open to the public but either way its great to have them out and if we get one new kid hooked on fishing each time then it was well worth it. I cant wait for the next event
234181,FinS,2008-07-29 22:54:00,463,great job to the chapter and yourself Mike a big kudos to u  i was gonna bring my 3 boys out twins 2 and older guy is 4 but we had a family thing that day im sure my oldest would have loved it there should be more and more things like this for the kids next year i am certain i will attend with the boys congrats again
