234421,luv2drift,2008-07-30 18:19:00,147,Has anyone ever fished Bob Lake.  Muskoka/ Haliburton area. If so what can I expect and what should I use. Just wondering if it is a trout lake or a bass/pike/walleye lake?

234473,solopaddler,2008-07-30 20:24:00,8605,If it's the one in Haliburton I'm familiar with it. Unless it's changed there was smallmouth and lake trout when I fished it years ago. Call the MNR district office in Minden and ask to speak to a biologist. They'll gladly give you the up to date lowdown on the lake as well as other possible fishing opportunities in the area.
234628,Braz,2008-07-31 01:49:00,9,Wow this is a blast from the past for me...I used to spend about 3 weeks a year with my family here.  My brother and I fished the hell out of this lake with not much luck unless you consider rock bass good fishing.  It is a deep lake so we finally got wise and more experienced.  Now we are talking a good 15-20 years ago but there is some big Lake Trout in this lake that we finally found.  This will date how long ago it was but we started trolling using Pink Ladies to get us deeper with spoons and we nailed big Lake Trout.  To date the only mounted fish I have.  Not a big lake but a nice spot.  If you see the cottage built on a huge rock that is where we stayed.  Good luck and take pictures!
