234362,ChrisK,2008-07-30 14:48:00,2772,And on that note...I think everything has been said that needs to be said here....  Cheers
234335,DT10Sam,2008-07-30 12:48:00,480,"I have been staying clear of commenting on most threads due to the fact that there are far too many that wish to bash others etc and being an owner of a shop I sometimes have to bite my tongue on some of the things that get posted here as it might reflect on my business, and today's society there are many that require us sponsors or shop owners etc to be politically correct. I know that I have posted my comments on other boards in regards to the fishing in the area and I get immediately stomped on for telling the truth. Seems that I might be hurting the area if I post the truth, however I do feel comfortable stating other wise..............just like on this thread this fish is definitely not a chinook and I feel that the thread should be locked to prevent any bashing to the angler etc.  I know that the mods are monitoring this thread closely to prevent some immature posters from starting to bash........... there might be an error here by the angler and then again there might not be. The case is that there is a proud angler that posted his catch that he caught from a pier and he felt that he harvested a chinook salmon. Sometimes it is better to send a pic to one of the mods or one of the most experienced anglers on this forum to get a correct identification if you are not sure of the species of fish.  Spiel is extremely knowledgeable of the species as seen in other posts etc. so he would be a good person to contact in a case such as this. To be politically correct I then decided to side with Spiel so that I would not receive flamed emails as I have in the past.  It is time to lock this thread and move on and to side on the politically correct nice salmon, (I do know what species this is).  Regards, Sam"
233717,CLofchik,2008-07-28 17:32:00,854,"Some guys live for opening day of bass, others for fall steel.  I love fall chinooks off the piers, late summer gun metal freight trains, giddity giddity.  On hearing rumours that an early run was on I couldn't help myself and roused early to be casting before dawn.  Ahhhh, the ozone hiss of the flash warming up, following the graceful arc of the glo spoon descending towards the calm waters like a falling star landing in an inland sea.  Feeling the thump-thump of the spoon slowly working, the anticipation of the strike that may never come.  But this morning the wait isn't a long one, a STRIKE, a short hit but that was definitely a FISH.  Only five casts in, this is going to be a memorable morning.  Another half hour of casting, varying retrieves, the occasional large fish rising, was that a carp or something more silver?  Then the hit, BAMMMM, slam the rod back quickly three times to lay the big single hook in deep and the weight is still there, then the familiar cry that hasn't been uttered since last season, FISH ON!  A few head shakes, then the run.  Drag screams as line melts off the spool as the silver fresh fish moves quickly left, then out of the water in three successive leaps.  The barely dawn light glistens from it's silvery blue sides as it crashes back down into the water and begins a quick bulldogging fight, trying to keep deep but the steady pressure of braid & flourocarbon eventually wins the tug of war. Coming to net after a valiant fight the exhausted fish lays quietly as the first king of the season hits the concrete.  Wooooo baby this is going to be a banner season!    Glorious colours, from an inch away it's hard for the wide angle to capture all of the fish...................................                               Okay, it may be a little small, but it's still a KING.  First one of the year. Woot, another 12.5"" for Team #4  "
233728,highdrifter,2008-07-28 18:07:00,2534,"OH now you've done it!  If you were working on tipping the scales for a mass pandemonium to the piers, then mission accomplished!  LOL  That's a purty little king though.  Congrats.  Me want.. ME WANT!!  cheers HD"
233735,Leecher,2008-07-28 18:22:00,7832,Great job CLofchik That sure was a fun read  Thanks for sharing Leechman
233758,splashhopper,2008-07-28 19:31:00,2931,"Umm..I Googled ""Armpit of Ontario"" and didn't see where that was  I guess i will wait for the run at ""The Prettiest Town in Canada"".  to come in too.  Thanks for the teaser though LoL  Splashhopper"
233760,modny,2008-07-28 19:42:00,502,nice catch  what pier were u fishing from>??
233764,highdrifter,2008-07-28 19:57:00,2534, 
233775,Hooked,2008-07-28 20:18:00,891,  I was thinking the exact same thing.
233776,salmon,2008-07-28 20:20:00,334,Nice I can see the line up at Lebarons for the Cleos LOL Jose
233778,lookinforwalleye,2008-07-28 20:22:00,4399,That`s some blow by blow account for a 12 incher!  I can`t wait for the report for the 25 pounder!!
233782,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-07-28 20:32:00,1362,great report  thanks for the good read!
233783,StrealHeader,2008-07-28 20:38:00,56,Is it just me or did you slaughter an atlantic?
233787,wallacio,2008-07-28 20:47:00,475,"Difficult to say from the photo but the overall shape and forked tail does suggest an Atlantic (only 1 over 24.8"" may be retained)."
233790,highdrifter,2008-07-28 20:55:00,2534," WHOAH.  Another funny!!  j/k  Personaly, I don't feel that slaughter is the right word here.  It would be more along the lines of harvest... Nothing wrong with that.  He wasn't exactly lining fish with marshmellows.  I can see why you would think it's a salmo salar because of the markings, but young jack kings (this fish is probably a year old) also have these markings..  I'm pretty positive that it's a chinny.  Anyone care to back me up on this one?  HD"
233796,DT10Sam,2008-07-28 21:00:00,480,"Pretty sure that is not a chinook check the tail on it and it will tell you that it is another salmon....most likely an Atlantic.  I have been fishing chinooks for some time and the young shakers that we get definitely do not have the same tail as the one in the pic and the colours are different.  You will have google some pics and you will see that it is not a chinook.  Regards, Sam"
233798,Spiel,2008-07-28 21:06:00,9065,....Coho
233800,DT10Sam,2008-07-28 21:09:00,480,Spiel is right Coho and not Atlantic.
233801,steverowbotham,2008-07-28 21:09:00,1800,"pretty sure its an atlantic, meaning that the harvest was not legal seeing as it would have to be greater than 24.8 inches."
233807,highdrifter,2008-07-28 21:16:00,2534," Maybe a coho?  I'm not convinced that it's an atlantic.  The jaw line and eyes just arn't right.  Also, young chinook parr do have forked tails..."
233808,wuchikubo,2008-07-28 21:17:00,1114,I think it's a Coho too. No large black spots on back or gill plate.
233810,highdrifter,2008-07-28 21:19:00,2534, You ever caught one?
233812,Spiel,2008-07-28 21:21:00,9065,"....My thoughts....  While I'm not certain it's a Coho I am certain it's not an Atlantic. The caudal peduncle, to small and to narrow. The tail to deeply forked which now leads me to this....Pink. Pinks have very deep forked tails. Or a real possibility, Pinook!  Oh yes I have caught an seen a handful of Atlantics.  A few better shots would help."
233817,scuro,2008-07-28 21:32:00,386,  Armpit of Ontario has got to be Sudbury or the Hammer.
233820,Greencoachdog,2008-07-28 21:39:00,8163,Noice fish!!!  It looks like cutbait for Catfish to me... but what does a Redneck know aboot Salmonoids?
233870,Joey,2008-07-28 23:48:00,9122,"Awesome, way to go.  We'll take as many points as we can get  Nice fish.  Joey"
233890,Burtess,2008-07-29 01:24:00,901,"For comparison, here is an atlantic I caught off a Lake O pier in the spring of '07.  The heavy scale loss looks similar to the scale loss on the fish I caught.  Coho and chinook do not usually lose that many scales with gentle handling.  Head looks a little large compared to the body though...    Burt"
