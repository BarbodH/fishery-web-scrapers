234299,icefisherman,2008-07-30 04:00:00,952,"Well after reading few reports from the Blue Zone today and keep reading about if for few years I've decided to make a run to it this afternoon. It took me about 25 min to 320 fow, dropped rods down and trolled to 341 and then back to 280...lots of good hits...lost track at some point but must have been 8 for 14 or so. Mostly bows but 3-4 Kings as well. Anywhere from 3-4 Lbs to 14 Lbs. No time for pictures as rods kept me busy all the time for the three hours we were there...didn't get chance to sit much ;D Most hits on leadcore (6 colors) and riggers 35' down. Tried flies  - nothing.....all hits on spoons...black/purple did the most damage...at one point I've lost the treble together with the ring but saved the lure itself...put new hook and got 4 more fish on it. Watermelon got some hits, blue/silver/white did as well...and black and silver did good too. Speed 2.7-2.8 mph  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
