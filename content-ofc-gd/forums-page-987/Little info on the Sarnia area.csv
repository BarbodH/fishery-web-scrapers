Never been there, and I am not well informed of the Depths, structure, prime species or even the best way to approach this water.  We're tagging along with another boat who fishes the area with some limited success(Pickeral & Perch) They like to drift and bottom bounce for pickeral useing leetches, worm harness's jigs etc... Appearently the current is swift, so this is the ideal method according to them. Any body else concur, or disagree?  I'm easy...I just want to maximize my time on the water. Not sure if there are there better opportunitys for other speicies, or if the riggers would come in handy at all? Just feeling out my options. Thanks! "
