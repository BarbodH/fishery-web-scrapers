Solo posted this Bass...but I loved the rock wall background in this one....   Here's a neat pic of a pike I was bringing in....   Here's some of the wildlife we saw.  Figures that a few of them were on top of garbage in this remote area.....          Finally...some scenery pics....      In case you missed the videos on the other thread...here they are again....
