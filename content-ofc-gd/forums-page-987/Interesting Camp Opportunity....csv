Norcan Lake Log Cabin (Near calabogie)  Location: North Canonto concession 3 lot 22, property Roll No 1042 110-040-16200 on Norcan Lake in the Township of North Frontenac  Size: roughly 24 x 20 with a loft about 24 x 10 and is about 20 years old (MNR estimate)  Info: The land use permit allows youth groups to lease the land for $738.30 per year. The new lessees will purchase the cabin for $1 from Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada to formalize the transfer.  The cabin itself is in sound structural condition and I could not find any leaks due to a solid roof. The Windows are all intact and the doors have locks.  The decking at the front of the cabin will need to be reinforced as some of the support members and components are rotting as they are not protected by the overhanging roof.  The inside of the cabin will need a good cleaning due to a few years of non-use and there is some debris around the property that should be cleaned up. (i.e. old inner tubes, a rusty old barrel, etc.  The cabin sits upon the edge of a hill with a great view over the lake. The lake is beautiful and the surrounding area pristine.
