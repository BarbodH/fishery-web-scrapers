I did manage to find the video by searching.  Here's the direct link: http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=kUY2rwhV-U8  Really enjoyed watching the little guy dart around your yard - thanks for posting it!  Great picture quality, too.  That cat sure doesn't take no for an answer, does she?"

234771,blaque,2008-07-31 12:26:00,2419,"sweet footage, not to take away from your vid, but did anyone also take a look at Tod the Fox in the related videos to the right. Its a domesticated pet fox that has all kinds of videos from its owner. Pretty neat, i think its a bit much for a pet, but pretty cute none the less"
