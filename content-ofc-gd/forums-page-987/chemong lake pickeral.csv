234205,skeeter,2008-07-29 23:46:00,1907,"july 19th my buddy Shane came up to my trailer on chemong to do a little fishing. we went out at 7am and trolled for a couple of hours. we were getting some little ones hitting the lures but nothing to brag about. then i had a light hit, figuring it was a small bass i just gave the rod a jerk to set the hook. then bam, the rod bends right over ,yank yank yank. i said to Shane, i think i got a pickeral. first comes the head shakes--oh ya its a pickeral!!!! then the line starts ripping out of my reel---damn its not a pickeral, its a muskie i said. a few more hard pulls then it starts to come in like a pickeral-- now were both confused its staying down deep so we cant see it. im waiting for it to see the boat, if it takes off running then we know its a muskie. instead it comes up to the surface. HOLY CRAP its a pickeral. Shane quick get the net, as i said it i turned toward him and he already has it in hand. poof-- in goes the net and up comes the pickeral all in one motion what a way to break in the new net!!!! thanks shane.. its nice to know i have a couple of good fishing buddy's i can count on. 25""  5lb 3oz if you look at the tail you can see why were confused. somebody else wanted him for his own dinner- mr muskie. ( Tracker was still sleeping )  when you comming back up shane??  CCMT you can add this to our TEAM EXTREME total if you dont mind.. www.ontarioanglerawards.com/user.cfm?UID=10047 "
