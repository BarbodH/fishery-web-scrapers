Also, they don't fight worth a damn. Generally you set the hook and reel 'em in, nothing at all like the acrobatics of a wild fish. Another factor, the ones here in Ontario (Georgian Bay mostly) have been engineered to spawn in the fall. If you catch a short, fat blunt nosed rainbow spitting loose eggs or milt in Oct or Nov you can be a guaranteed it's not a wild fish..."
