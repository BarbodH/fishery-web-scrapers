Thanks  Oh.....also,thinking about Century Lodge on Eagle in September......anyone with any info on this place?"
234425,Slimeball,2008-07-30 18:29:00,30," Do you mean LOTW? Eagle should be on Navionics Hot Maps Premium 08' Canada chip. The owners of Century Lodge are from my home state of Michigan. I have not been to Century but have talked with them many times and have a friend that chases muskies there every summer. Osbourne and Nivens Bay are a shallower, darker sector of Eagle. Big muskies and great smallmouth. Bob M. fishes out of Century lodge alot, you can view some episodes here http://www.myoutdoortv.com/new/simply-fishing.html click on Bart & Bob Osbourne Bay muskies episode.  Good luck! Jay"
