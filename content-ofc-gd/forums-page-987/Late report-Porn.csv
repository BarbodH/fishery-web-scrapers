234523,mistaredone,2008-07-30 22:18:00,913,My best man and I went out the day befor my wedding up to Cameron Lake for a few hours of Musky fishing.  After about an Hour and a half we moved two fish burning bucktails on a out side weed line drift.  Secound drift I hit right at the spot I missed a fish on a botched figure 8.  She came in at only 34'' but was a clean fish and had lots of fight in her  http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/m...ng/IMG_1700.jpg  http://s305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/m...¤t=IMG_1700.jpg  The second fish came half way through my victory cigar.  This one was a little bigger at 40'' she came from almost the same spot.  Outside weed edge with a nice deep drop off close by.   http://s305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/m...¤t=IMG_1703.jpg http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/m...ng/IMG_1703.jpg  http://s305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/m...¤t=IMG_1708.jpg http://i305.photobucket.com/albums/nn211/m...ng/IMG_1708.jpg  Now the wedding and honeymoon are over im looking to go strong into late summer/fall musky fishing.  To answer a question I have asked on this board I would go 80 rather than 65lb braid.  I had each on two reels and lost one lure on a mid cast tangle on the 65 spider wire.  Also moving to power pro because spider wire slips through plainer boards.  Anyone have problems with Musky Mayhem floro leaders?  I had two snaps break on one trip!  Hope the pics work.  Enjoy!
