CCMT & Bly are great people to know, we had a blast with them . if they are the example of the kind of people that are members on this board then im  going to show up at a lot more OFC G2G's and for the rest of the the OFC members , you guy's should come out to the G2G's they have, and meet up with the others that are there. Tracker and I went to the g2g last fall in quinte and it to was a great time. all in all our g2g went good, especialy for bly and i, we kicked ccmt & trackers butts fishing----LOL-- ps: keeping the crappies was Bly's idea. thats my story and im sticking to it!!!!   Tracker and i both have told you that the invite back up to our places is an open invitation!!!! "

We should see about heading up again before the summer is up.....our team needs a good muskie...maybe we should target them one day to see if we can upgrade our tiny one!!  LOL.
