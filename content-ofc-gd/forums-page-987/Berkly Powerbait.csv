234049,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-29 15:19:00,3761,I have never really used to many of their products. For bass what products are good to use.  Thanks for any help.  Mike
234054,tibbs,2008-07-29 15:48:00,650,I like there powerworms and tubes for bass.
234056,MuddyWater,2008-07-29 15:51:00,218,yumm works better for me and way cheaper
234058,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-29 15:56:00,3761," I also love YUM baits, i would just like a little diversity in my box. Try something new."
234063,MuddyWater,2008-07-29 16:02:00,218,also remember if its working dont change anything lol
234087,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-29 17:01:00,3761," I don't want to change just maybe get more stuff. Every company has their ""really good"" baits and this is why i am asking for powerbait right now and not Zoom, or Mizmo. Once in a while we need to try something new to further improve our fishing abilities.  Mike"
234091,GBW,2008-07-29 17:07:00,8460," oh and the 3"" yellow jigging grub is ok too..."
234122,jediangler,2008-07-29 19:37:00,1923,"Pick up some 1/8oz jigs in yellow or orange and tip them with the pumpkinseed/chartreuese 3"" power grubs. Works on everything that swims."
234195,BabyHerc,2008-07-29 23:21:00,285,"I like all the Berkley Baits.  4"" Power Craw and 10"" Power Worm get my top two votes."
234259,bassmaster4,2008-07-30 01:53:00,801,i like the realstix they work well for smallies
234267,Cudz,2008-07-30 02:24:00,2652,try some of their new hollow belly swimbaits.  I have heard they work alright.  They are not too $$.  Spend a bit more and buy gulp stuff. I think it is better.  I feel as though I am working for them these days.
234358,Gianeye,2008-07-30 14:32:00,7,"Power worms are excellent as are the tubes. Go for natural colours.  I love the grubs for walleye, white being an excellent choice. For some reason I catch more walleye on the power grub than on gulp."
234360,cranks bait,2008-07-30 14:38:00,721,"I used a 3"" tube from them last night.  Didn't catch any fish.  On the bright side, my wife thought I was hanging out with some young chick because I had glitter and sparkles all over me.  I thought I was going fishing, not getting all decked up to go to a disco."
234433,Rich,2008-07-30 18:45:00,3927,Power worms and power tubes are proven catchers for quite some time now. I think the first pack of plastic worms I ever bought with my own money were Power Worms.
