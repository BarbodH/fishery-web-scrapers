233098,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-07-26 16:42:00,0,"man O man,  my centerpin reel started rusting already ... why dont rainbows spawn all year round ... then none of us have to wait!"
233119,Canuck2fan,2008-07-26 17:57:00,1444, Here is the funny thing if you know how to float for steelies you should be able to the same thing for bass using gulp live or live leeches but you never heard from me LOL..... The trouble is most true steelheaders don't recognize their favourite haunts unless there is a foot of snow on the ground and ice bergs floating by while they wade along looking for spots.
233151,JoshS,2008-07-26 19:42:00,729,"bows, browns, cohos..  I missed most of the last five seasons being out here in Montreal hopefully I'll get a few drifts in this fall."

233639,aniceguy,2008-07-28 13:02:00,1094,I gotta admit I look forward to those cool days of the fall too a few pics to add      
233648,ccmtcanada,2008-07-28 13:16:00,7971,Here's a few...as much as I LOVE steelhead fishing....I can wait another month I think.    These was taken from a protected spot....it was amazing seeing them come in from the big lake and into this tiny little creek....    
233653,modny,2008-07-28 13:17:00,502,",man i really want to get into this fall rainbow action...  is there anything special that i would need? or can i use spinning gear?"
233671,Wild,2008-07-28 13:55:00,704,Spectacular pics guys! Sure makes one look forward to the fall.
233706,Headhunter,2008-07-28 17:17:00,5703,"Those fish are abundantly available right now in 360 feet of water.... and no one to push you out of the way and nothing but blue sky and tons of open water! And it's virtually impossible to line them"" HH"
233712,ccmtcanada,2008-07-28 17:24:00,7971, Thanks Joe...so...my chest waders likely wouldn't do out there?? LOL.  Maybe I'll use a float tube....how far off shore is 360 feet of water???  So what you are telling me is to leave the marshmallows on shore for that outing??? hehe.
233719,Canuck2fan,2008-07-28 17:35:00,1444," You can use spinning gear. Although longer rods help because then you can use lighter line (which isn't nearly as important as it used to be now with fluoro leaders) You can use a 7ft spinning rod I would recommend a reel that holds at least 250yds plus of 8 lb line though. A 7ft rod for chucking spoons for salmon is ok and you may just hook into something. If you get a salmon off a pier you will understand pretty quickly why I suggest the reel needs to hold 250yds of line. LOL I have been very close to being spooled and my reel will take 330 yds of 6lb test easily.... some fish just don't want to come in and if you add a outgoing river current they can go a ways before tiring out.  Also with a rod that short you can try bottom fishing off of piers. Basics are a 3ft 6lb fluoro leader, with a number 12 or 10 size hook with a number 10 or 12 swivel above the swivel you put on an sliding sinker the size will depend on the current use the lightest sinker you can that will still hold bottom I have found that the pyramid sinkers work better than the egg type. For bait can blow up a worm or use a roe bag tied with some floaters in it as the bait has to be up off the bottom. Keep your bail open and use a small weighted bottle or stone to keep your line tight..... Watch for that little bottle to fall over take up the slack and nail that steelie, and hang on.  While it is possible to float fish with a 7ft spinning rod I would recommend only doing that off a pier too, because in a river you are going to having such short drifts that unless you out there by yourself you are going to hearing a lot of comments from other anglers. I love the looks you get when you float fish off a pier..... you know everybody is calling you an idiot until you land the first fish of the day that is LOL."
233720,Headhunter,2008-07-28 17:38:00,5703,"Cliff, you will hit 300ft of water at around the 12 mile mark! You may want to consider the ""deep spool"" for that amount of line! HH"
233748,cplummer,2008-07-28 19:13:00,165,Dang  i miss the steel bad...  last season i landed a total of 217 steelies out of the mighty niagara with the biggest being just shy of 19 lbs... BRING IN..  out with the warm in with the cold!!!!!

234182,solopaddler,2008-07-29 22:55:00,8605,"To answer your question, I love 'em, but I have no problem waiting for them.  There's a time and place (and season) for everything....."
232739,MuddyWater,2008-07-25 17:16:00,218,i cant wait till those nice shiny rainbows start showing up. hopefully we get lots of rain in the fall to get rid of those stinky salmon so those nice rainbows will challenge me for the 15th year in a row or something like that  im pumped!!! 
232757,highdrifter,2008-07-25 18:14:00,2534,"MMMEEEEEE  There's nothing like the pull of a fresh steelhead, a gleaming silver bullet of pure muscle, the acrobatics, the feeling of being soo.... ALIVE!  For now I'll content myself with northerns I guess..  AH now I'm happy.  Back to work.  cheers HD"

232776,tdotfisherman,2008-07-25 18:36:00,317,"The funny thing is, the only real thing about the Fall that I'm really looking forward to is fishing Salmon and Trout up the rivers and creeks.. Besides that, nothing."
232790,blaque,2008-07-25 19:04:00,2419," Amen to that Buck, heres for hoping for a wet remainder of the summer as well"
232802,modny,2008-07-25 19:18:00,502,"i can't wait to fish for some fall rainbows.  i've never done it before so i'm really looking forward to it...hopefully i can partner up with someone for a day so i can learn how to get a couple.  i've been doing some reading, but hookin up with an OFC'r would be a tonne better.  do u use light tackle for them?"
232806,Greencoachdog,2008-07-25 19:25:00,8163,"  HOT DAMN!!!   ... yer gonna target them ""Nuke Fish""... aintcha???  *Glow*"

232826,Greencoachdog,2008-07-25 20:28:00,8163,  Try using a hook... near the water!!!
232873,jwl,2008-07-25 23:35:00,1056," I,m with you man, I can't wait until all the rejects go home during the annual ""salmon angler"" run and the mess they all bring along  to be over...the days start to get cold,the snow to start to fly,put on the float suits,load up the boat,and have another killer winter like we did last year man by putting a few hundred steelies in the boat"
232875,camillj,2008-07-25 23:40:00,1988,sheesh lads ... dont wish your life away ... theres plenty of summer left ... but only 5 months until Christmas !!!
232880,misfish,2008-07-25 23:51:00,29133,"Im looking forward to it,but not sure how Im going to like my new float set up.I,ll be virgining it this fall. I maybe asking you float PROS,a few question when the time comes. Either I,ll get the hang of it,or the ol Hell bender will be in hand come the time."
232898,Mark Mc,2008-07-26 00:59:00,8,"Don't get me wrong, I like summer a bit but nothing beats fall and winter time. Especially when it comes to fishing the steelies. Heres a few notty chromers to wet the appetite for the upcoming bow season.      "
232902,Marko,2008-07-26 01:08:00,854,Steelheads are one of the most beautiful fish around. Love those pics of steel in snow!
232911,ironstone74,2008-07-26 01:23:00,201,Yes fellas it won't be long now.  I picked up an Islander centerpin from JC and am looking to upgrade the big stick too!  Bring on the crisp air and bright CHROME  It's better to have fished and lost than to never have fished at all!  Paul
232956,addict,2008-07-26 02:55:00,475,brrrr dont get me wrong i love chrome and fish em all fall and winter but ill take warm weather smallies and buckets any day.i prefer to have feeling in my fingers when i fish.
