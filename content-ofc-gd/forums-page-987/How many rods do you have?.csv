232841,Hawg Hunter,2008-07-25 21:23:00,204,"OPPS never fill out a poll with your wife standing beside you talking,i put my answer for how many rods i take in the boat and not how many i own,i have just been informed lol that i have 44 rods and reels,how-ever i told her i don't use then all some have no line on them. WRONG THING TO SAY LOL I now have been informed were having a garage sale LOL.LOL.LOL.  TAKER EASY ALL  Hawg Hunter"
232848,misfish,2008-07-25 21:53:00,29133," Time and place, is very important to some of us.LOL"
232860,Handlebarz,2008-07-25 22:31:00,3790,  Yep and it was bought back in the 80's and still works great I love it even thought I did just buy two new one in the last week or so they are them Twitching ones and they are awesome for fishing two rods for pickeral on the lake you can set the line out and twitch it back in one hand it is amazing how far these have come.
233001,jace,2008-07-26 08:09:00,472,"  cool.  you don't see many old Bantams still being used.  You must be talking about the Daiwa ""twitching bar.""  I bought the Viento with that a few years ago, nice reels for sure.   It's one of the farthest casting, low profile reels i have.  With a longer rod, that reel can cast it down to the backing.   and it palms really well for all day comfort.   I think you'll enjoy them enough to retire the old bantam."

234018,mistyriver1,2008-07-29 13:25:00,600,17  (includes 3 icefishing combos)
234085,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-29 16:58:00,3761,ok so so far there is 176 votes and i am surprised but not very. Many of the users are adults and have been collecting rods for years and this does not surprise me now that many of the votes are for 20 rods and up. Keep the votes going maybe we can reach 200.
234161,solopaddler,2008-07-29 21:37:00,8605,"I used to have an ungodly number of rods/reels but have pared the selection down somewhat over the years. If all the rods you own are higher end, and/or custom, a handful of sticks like that could easily equate into a forest of cheaper rods. Everything is relative.  Which would you rather have one Ferrari or a dozen Honda Civics?"
234168,Canuck2fan,2008-07-29 22:01:00,1444, I don't know what car I would prefer if money was no object.... I might be getting too old to heal successfully from owning a Ferrari if I really put it through it paces to enjoy it LOL. Speaking of exotic Italian machines I did see the darnest thing a couple of minutes ago. I was at Giant Tiger here getting some milk for tomorrows coffee fix and as I am walking in there was a Lambougina Diablo crusing along as the driver was checking out the display racks of clothing for sale... Now I do actually know the next door neighbour of the car owner and they are pretty close I got to remember to find out if it a real one or a kit car.... Either way it was a funny site seeing it at a discount store LOL.
234169,Mattones,2008-07-29 22:09:00,587,"Three. Ones my girlfriends rod now, and the one i used before is a P.O.S from wal-mart Its reel is broken and when a fish takes the line you cant reel it in. haha I should take it apart but meh."
234238,MrMike,2008-07-30 00:53:00,153,more every week
232353,misfish,2008-07-24 20:53:00,29133,I think you missed the dingy thread.LOL
232365,Handlebarz,2008-07-24 21:12:00,3790,I will not count just stay safe with over 20 the wife is all good wit hthe rods we have I think she gets a little worked up when we go musky hunting and also bait fish fishing (pickerl perch bass) in the same trip out she knows that the boat is going to be loaded down with troling musky rods casting musky rods and all the other little rods and bait casters. I must say that for all the extra rods that head out on them trips I do keep them up front with me so that the family does not have to trip over them. As for my favorite rod for bait caster it would still have to be.    
232502,misfish,2008-07-25 00:03:00,29133, 
232636,modny,2008-07-25 11:15:00,502,"i want to get a really long rod for slip bobber fishing, and still got to get a microlite rod"
232641,jace,2008-07-25 11:48:00,472,  Is that an older BM50?    bantam.
231401,fishindevil,2008-07-23 01:08:00,6254,"Well at last count 43 rods and about 50 reels !!!!!!     heck i have almost 20 that are just walleye rods,and 10 or so just for salmon fishing on lake ontario,you need a new chart for us hardcore guys !!!!!!...."
231403,Daplumma,2008-07-23 01:09:00,1961,Me too Dan. Joe
231408,Spiel,2008-07-23 01:14:00,9065, ....So it doesn't just happen to me?
231412,misfish,2008-07-23 01:18:00,29133," I had one of them once,twice removed.LOL HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA"
231414,jwl,2008-07-23 01:20:00,1056,"If I think about it, I think I have more then I posted in my vote..lol  2 ultralite spinning combos 6-Med action spinning combos 1-noodle rod 2- heavy action spinning rods I use for trolling and musky fishing  plus some misc rods and reels in the shed at my trailer for just incase..lol"
231418,Dabluz,2008-07-23 01:25:00,701,"I don't have anywhere near the budget that most fishermen have but I do have over 20 rods and just as many good reels to go with them.  Ok....I'm old and I do have rods that are over 10 years old.  However, all of them are graphite rods.  My last addition is a Fenwick HMX fly rod for no 9 line and a Fenwick Knighthawk reel to go with it.  I won this outfit in a fishing contest this spring.  I rarely buy any rods or reels unless they are really at a fantastic sale price.  Example:  Berkley Lightning Rod baitcaster for 20 dollars last year, new Shimano Calyx 100A for 30 dollars last year, new Shimano Cardif 101 for 50 bucks (delivered) from last year, some almost new Daiwa H103 Procaster Z and X reels for about 15 dollars each on Ebay, tow 7 foot 1 piece Team Daiwa Tierra baitcasting rod for 25 dollars each (delivered), new Okuma Stinson spinning reel that I won with a bunch of stuff in another contest last winter, a Shimano Symetre 2000 spinning reel on sale a few years ago, 2 brand new Berkley Salmon series 2 piece baitcasters 8 1/2 feet long for 20 dollars each at a liquidation store, etc etc.  It's a question of just waiting until a bargain happens and then taking good care of the item after that."
231419,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-23 01:25:00,3761,"Holy crap everyone 40 and 50 rods. I should of made more choices. wow, some people have to much money to spend."
231420,holdfast,2008-07-23 01:28:00,1813,"I got enough for an Army.  Some I never even used because they re too shiny, I know, but at least I don't gamble"
231423,Canuck2fan,2008-07-23 01:30:00,1444, Nope..... and it doesn't matter which courier either if it says fragile the box must have one or preferably two holes punched or kicked in it. Maybe fragile means ventilate in some language?
231425,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-23 01:31:00,3761,"Well to tell the truth as i age i want to have the following rods. I want a rod for each application: crankbaits,jerkbaits,topwater,heavy cover,spinnerbaits,livebait and that should do me"
231429,misfish,2008-07-23 01:35:00,29133,And what kind of rod would that be?
231435,richyb,2008-07-23 01:39:00,774,"I mainly use my med heavy casting rod for crankbaits,jerkbaits,topwater,heavy cover,spinnerbaits,,   then i use my spinning rods for the soft plastics ...   and i use that same spinning rod for having fun with a worm and bobber ( maybe a few bubblies are involved off the dock the odd time   )  ...  The only time i use my med casting rod is when theres no chance of any big fish and defnitly no muskie ."
231436,danbo,2008-07-23 01:40:00,2646,"Geez, I thinned my collection way down..4 flyrod/reels,3 spinning,1 casting & 2 ice-fishing.."
231437,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-23 01:41:00,3761, something light in action.

231443,Burning Babies,2008-07-23 01:52:00,150,I own close to 20.  Just over a dozen of those get used regularly.  Right now I usually have nine in the boat.
231444,misfish,2008-07-23 01:53:00,29133,How many lures go with those?  Thats another story aint it.LOL
231451,Fisherpete,2008-07-23 02:08:00,1814,"19 rods for me, 9 reels.  There were more but I sold off a half dozen earlier this year.  Lures - don't even go there!"

231483,MrMike,2008-07-23 03:38:00,153,22 and counting
231550,Victor,2008-07-23 11:29:00,1609,"i have around 10-12 at the moment.. but i see that will grow real quick as I fish for quite a few different species ... also want to get into fly/float fishing as well haha.  Thank you for this thread MTBF. It gives me a perfect excuse to buy more lol ""lots of other people have like 40-50 rods!""."
231591,doubleheader,2008-07-23 13:07:00,497,"I literally have no idea but I'm sure between my spinning, fly, casting, trolling, and noodle I'm close to 50. Of those probably 10 get 85% of the use."
231606,Garyv,2008-07-23 13:53:00,547,20+++ in fact I still have one of my first bamboo poles and the old pocket fisherman.
231617,Leecher,2008-07-23 14:33:00,7832,"Man I guess I wasnt paying attention as to how many rods I have  Seriously......only have 8 spinning rods, 1 big game, 1 ultra light and only use 2 at a time while fishing  Question:  Does tipups for ice fishing count??  If it does, then I have 30 - 50 of them...... I make my own  Leechman"
231338,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-22 23:46:00,3761,Just curious to see how many rods people are using out on the water. My guess is most people are from 1-3 but who knows. I only have 2 but will be getting a third.
231340,mbac31,2008-07-22 23:50:00,904,"I wont post how many for fear my wife will see. I think you would be surprised how many some people actually do have. Including my fly fishing, salmon, trout, ocean, bass, walleye muskie, etc. I have acumullated a few over the years."

231345,misfish,2008-07-22 23:56:00,29133,"  Still counting.I,ll get back to you on this one.LOL"
231348,Canuck2fan,2008-07-22 23:58:00,1444,I refuse to answer on the grounds that I would have to go into my fishing room and count them..... Also your poll makes no provision for rods that are in the mail having just been ordered but are not yet technically in ones possession.  Seriously I only have about 8 or so....
231349,troutologist,2008-07-22 23:59:00,951,Did actually counting make anybody else laugh and shake your head?   And I still need more...
231351,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-23 00:01:00,3761,gee i wonder how many Bob Izumi or Dave Mercer has......
231353,mbac31,2008-07-23 00:03:00,904,"I dont think I can count that high anymore. LOL. I have gone as far as getting them custom built now as I cant find anything on the shelf that suits me anymore.  Can you say ""TACKLEHOLIC"" "
231354,misfish,2008-07-23 00:07:00,29133," LOL Each time I grab a rod,I say I can put this bait on it,then theres the other baits that need rods to go with. It,s a never ending saga, Ok, I just looked over at the rod holder,I got 27. Thats just my bass,n stuff. I got  others tucked away for the fall and spring spieces.Oh, then theres the ice fishing thing that happens. Maybe another 8 for so. Thank gawd there is no Ocean around here. Oh wait. I got 3 down riggers too. Man I got to have a sale.LOL"
231355,Canuck2fan,2008-07-23 00:11:00,1444," NO laughing here I got a little ticked because looking reminded that I need two different types of rods that I CAN""T find anywhwere without compromising part of what I am looking for.... So now I am thinking screw it I will get into making my own but realize that would be a whole other nightmare LOL.  Lastly I just remembered that my holiest of holies is still sitting there with one eye where I punched out the ceramic. I need to get it fixed but it is my baby so bascially in all honesty anyone who fixes it is really putting their physical safety on the line because if anything bad happened to that particular rod I just could not be held responsible for how I would react. (which is why it is still sitting in the closet not fixed until I save up enough money for bail in case things go horribly wrong LOL)"

My rod stand does have a few extra spots open tho ....  maybe a house warming present?"
231372,Spiel,2008-07-23 00:33:00,9065," You realize of course Brian that if I screw up I won't be able to fix any of your rods.  As for how many, I still don't have one for every application and I'm fixing on having two or three for every application so I best not mess with Canuck2fan's rod."
231373,mkeyes,2008-07-23 00:34:00,26,"Right now I have three rods on the boat. One set up for top water. One set up with a pickerel rig. One set up for trolling with a jig, ready to add gulp.  I have asked for a Bass Pro gift certificate for my birthday because I would like to have a second rod set up with a pickerel rig. Lord knows my fav spot eats gear!!! But at least all I lose is the stuff at the end of the line....not like hubby who cast in and lost hold...opps there goes his fav 5' ultra light ugly stick hmmmmm. He ordered that one up from the states so I am hoping that I will be able to get him another one at BassPro.  Amazing how much equipment some of you guys have!!!!! I am jealous"

Couriers and I have do not have a happy relationship..... to me fragile MEANS fragile. To them it seems to say drop kick the SNOT of it till it quits moving. LOL.

I have looked on Ebay for years no luck on finding one.  However and this is a true story a friend of a friend who's sister's, uncle's, brother's, motherinlaws half cousion twice removed is reported to have one in a display case in their ""sports room"" that is not for sale because although they have never went ""fishing"" they sometime may find the time to see what all the fuss is about..... I thought it was a joke until the buddy who told me about seeing it clicked a picture with his camera phone just to drive me crazy."
