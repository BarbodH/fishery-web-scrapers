224605,muskymatt,2008-07-07 23:45:00,2608,Hey folks...  Just about 3 weeks left to buy tickets.  There are still a few left so buy them up.  6 fantastic prizes to get in on and only $5 a ticket.  Cheers  M.
226428,misfish,2008-07-11 20:56:00,29133,"Im sorry that I did not post this much earlier,but when I was up at Davids kids fishing day,he had the tickets up there for sale. I had asked if he had seen him. David  had dinner with the Big Guy that week and said he was in good spirits. I hear now there is some Goverment input for the funds on new drugs. Hope there is some to help out the cost for Big Jim.  Anyone have an Email for him? Pm if you like. Thanks Brian"

206080,Roy,2008-05-25 19:15:00,13728,I received this from Matt Clay this morning.
206083,muskymatt,2008-05-25 19:21:00,2608,Thanks Roy.
206093,carcham333,2008-05-25 19:38:00,6,I guess there is no need to be a member of MC to participate to this fundraiser? Thanks
206101,muskymatt,2008-05-25 19:56:00,2608,No. You do not have to be a member of MCI. This is to get support for Big Jim from the entire angling community.  Please buy as many tickets as you can to help.  If anyone needs any info feel free to contact me anytime.  Together we can all make a difference.
206114,Rich Clemens,2008-05-25 20:39:00,3131,Big Jim's a great guy and have met him a couple times when we were in Smith's Falls.  My father and step mother had the opportunity to spend a day on the water with Jim.  I know he'll beat this thing.
206497,Bear,2008-05-26 15:40:00,106," Matt, when and where will the tickets be available. His LARGENESS, is a close friend to many here at the shop. I'll spread the word here. Bear"
206518,capt bruce,2008-05-26 16:28:00,820,"Big Jim is a great guy anything I can do I will , he will beat this"
206526,muskymatt,2008-05-26 16:45:00,2608," Tickets are mostly available thru Jim Hutchings and myslf as explained at the bottom of the raffle sheet.  If you want tickets I'll have them from the printer tomorrow morning , you can call me at (613)723-9234 and I can get you as many as you need/like."
206581,bpsbassman,2008-05-26 18:13:00,941,"That's terrible news.  Jim is a fighter and if anybody can beat this, he is one of them."
206585,muskymatt,2008-05-26 18:19:00,2608,Hopefully we can all step up and support this effort to make things a little easier for Jim.  Each prize draw is valued at over  $1200   so 20$ worth of tickets is a great deal.  Like I said ...every penny goes to Jim.
206623,misfish,2008-05-26 19:32:00,29133,Thanks Roy. Met Jim on more then one occasion and a great guy with some great stories. Just ordered some tickets from Matt.  Thoughts and prayers go out to Jim and his family.
206803,muskymatt,2008-05-27 01:46:00,2608," It is amazing the stories Big Jim has. I've stood and listened as well, and enjoyed every minute.  Our goal is to make a difference through ticket sales  and we have lots of tickets to sell.  Please feel free to contact me anytime we can get them to anyone fast.  Thanks  M."
