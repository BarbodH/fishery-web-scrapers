I am heading up to that area for the weekend to fish.  Unfortunately I think I may be clearing roadways instead.  Darn micro bursts up there make for a lot of work.  although it also creates a lot of bass cover on the shore lines too."

Posted By Greg Hoekstra Posted 1 day ago   Environment Canada is investigating whether a tornado touched down near Coboconk on Saturday, just south of the border between Haliburton County and the City of Kawartha Lakes.  According to reports by the Canadian Press, a visitor to the area snapped photos of a column of cloud extending downward into a tree-lined hillside near Small Shadow Lake. The incident caused no injuries but tore down a swath of trees in its path. The surrounding area was also deluged by 35 millimetres of rain and hail Saturday afternoon.  At press time Environment Canada had not confirmed whether the incident was in fact a tornado, though the agency did say there were no other reports of funnel cloud sightings anywhere in the province.  Coboconk is located approximately 35 kilometres south of Minden on Highway 35.  For an update on the story see tomorrowâ€™s Minden Times."
