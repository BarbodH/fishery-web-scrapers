700563,tbayboy,2012-05-28 21:53:00,1497,"Some of you may have heard of the flooding happening in Thunder Bay that caused them to declare a state of emergency.  Pretty ugly stuff, still trying to get hold of my family up there to see if they're places are ok but this made me laugh, only in Thunder Bay:    EDIT: Turns out it's not a real pic from T Bay but then again some of those brookies could muscle their way across just fine  Here's a good link for the more dramatic photos: http://www.tbnewswatch.com/news/211833/Your-view-Flood  Hope everyone up there is making out ok."
700569,danc,2012-05-28 22:11:00,4677,"We are currently under a state of emergency up here mainly because our sewage treatment facility is flooded and partially under water. The pumps have been damaged and stopped working. Apparently we got over 100 mm of rain last night, and we were already on a flood alert before that. Many basements in the city have up to 5 feet of water in them. Mines fine.  I think that the fish on the road photo is a hoax. All the vegetation is in full bloom up here and in that photo it appears that nothing is in bloom.  Here's some photos that did come my way today from around the city.            "
700575,kickingfrog,2012-05-28 22:19:00,8333,Wow. And down here in central Ontario we've had squat but need of bad.
700585,adempsey,2012-05-28 22:37:00,1498,"Wow I had no idea.  Hope everyone recovers from this soon.   The destructive power of water never ceases to amaze me.  Also, I don't think that photo is fake, but I would agree it probably is from somewhere else."
700587,mercman,2012-05-28 22:44:00,7054,"Wow !! Thats terrible Dan.I sure hope the get things fixed up quickly. If you need anything, drop me a note and i'll get it to ya."
700588,Christopheraaron,2012-05-28 22:49:00,3525,"Pic doesn't look like a fake, wish we had some of that rain..."
700598,danc,2012-05-28 23:21:00,4677," A hoax is a deliberately fabricated falsehood made to masquerade as truth.  And thanks Paul. I'm just fine here. I had a very normal day here today. In fact even better. The city owned indoor swimming pool that I'm working at was closed down today to minimize water usage, so the 80 year old ladies that are usually there for their morning swim were sent home today, and us workers had the place to ourselves."
700600,Christopheraaron,2012-05-28 23:25:00,3525, Really!
700619,tbayboy,2012-05-28 23:54:00,1497,Your right Dan - that'll teach me to trust twitter   Here it is back in a 2011 Oregon article:  http://www.fws.gov/news/blog/index.cfm/2011/12/28/Top-Three-Caption-Calls-of-2011
700659,hoby5,2012-05-29 01:34:00,42,"Brutal floods all over that area and here we've got a 40,000 hecter fire going on not a great start to the fishing season"
700665,danc,2012-05-29 01:52:00,4677,"Weird, weird weather for sure TrueNorth. We had unheard of temps in the mid 80's F here in March. It seems that extremes are becoming more frequent each year. I hope that you guys get that fire situation under control soon."
700669,NAW,2012-05-29 02:06:00,4022,I had no clue that was going on.  Had a bunch of friends up there for a SAR meeting a few weeks back.  Craziness.
700713,BillM,2012-05-29 11:23:00,17367,Glad I left two days early!
700721,Fish4Eyes,2012-05-29 12:01:00,1022,The power of water is unbelievable. Hope all works out. I've seen videos where water washes out and separates a roadway like in DanC's first pic in 10-15min.
700989,danc,2012-05-29 21:34:00,4677,"It's still pretty much a state of chaos here today for many residents. By the sounds of things, there are hundreds (perhaps thousands) of homes with several feet of water in their basements still, as of today. People are trying to pump the water out (if you are lucky enough to get your hands on a pump) but it keeps coming back in just as fast. Many of these homes have had their power and natural gas cut off to reduce safety risks. We are still under a state of emergency here, mainly to try to get federal and provincial help from what I understand. The insurance claims will be monumental I'm sure.  CTV News report of whats happening here"
700991,lew,2012-05-29 21:46:00,12766,"Sounds bad up there Dan, hope things improve quickly for everybody."
700997,Joey,2012-05-29 21:58:00,9122,Well hope your home stays safe and sound Dan.  Man some of those roads are brutal.  That'll stop you in a hurry going down one of those roads in the dark
701004,danc,2012-05-29 22:14:00,4677,Thanks Joey and Lew. I have personally not been affected by this. My life goes on as normal. I'm one of the lucky ones. In times like this you have to be thankful and do what you can to help others. A facebook page has been set up HERE. I'll keep my eye on this and donate when and where I can.
701010,Roy,2012-05-29 22:48:00,13728,Best of luck Dan. I hope you stay high and dry.
701023,Christopheraaron,2012-05-29 23:38:00,3525,"Man, anyone would be insane to want to be in ontario right now, heat wave down south, fires east, and floods north, just weird and unbearable."
