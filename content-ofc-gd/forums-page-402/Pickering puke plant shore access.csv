701109,redpearl99,2012-05-30 05:10:00,259,Can someone tell me whether this spot (red line) is accessible for shore fishing ? thanks   
701118,Djeep,2012-05-30 10:54:00,199,If I remember correctly I believe there is a fence
701123,woodenboater,2012-05-30 11:10:00,2277,what Djeep said. The marked fence is where the waterfront trail turns north.

701132,Dave Bailey,2012-05-30 11:51:00,1641,"I live very near there, and I can tell you that the area in question is accessible for shore fishing if you walk around the fence. It means that you need to wade through the water, but there are benefits. Not long after doing so you will be treated to a free ride in a nice vehicle, whereupon after answering a few simple questions you may be treated to an all-expenses-paid few nights in an rather exclusive hotel, with round-the-clock security for your safety. If you play your cards right you may even be allowed to extend your vacation, and you won't be bothered by annoying friends and family.  "

701187,redpearl99,2012-05-30 14:45:00,259,I see what you guys are talking about     has anyone fished off the non fenced portion of Waterfront Trail?
701216,ricoboxing,2012-05-30 16:23:00,398,very little structure unless you can cast 500m.I take the kids there to throw rocks in the water when im in the area
701325,redpearl99,2012-05-30 22:20:00,259,from the looks of this it seems to be Carp heaven    you think there will still be great success from shore?
701326,Christopheraaron,2012-05-30 22:26:00,3525,"Seen that episode a few times, if you've got a boat I'm sure it'd be great!"
701341,redpearl99,2012-05-30 23:35:00,259,I only have an inflatable paddle boat I use to fish small lakes  I think Ill give that spot a try next time.  I've caught a 25lb+ Carp just down the road so I know they're definitely in that area
701342,Christopheraaron,2012-05-30 23:38:00,3525,"mmmm, might work on a calm day, good drag system against a 20+ pound carp!"
