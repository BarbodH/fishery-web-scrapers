700117,woodenboater,2012-05-27 18:50:00,2277,"Yup, other sites I belong to 'suffer' the same issues of the disproportionate ratio between the number of members and the numbers who actually contribute. Not much can be done about this from what I've learned as a member and admin of another site. We've talked about time caps on members in that if they didn't have x number of posts within a time period, they were sent a reminder and if no progress, their membership spiked. That never went anywhere and we just accepted it for what it was. That would would have hurt good members who gave much of their knowledge to those asking, just not online.  All one can do is appreciate those (and there are many here) who post trip reports or reviews, and thusly, make this place the great site, and resource, that it is. There are always going to be the givers and unfortunately, the takers."
700123,aplumma,2012-05-27 19:06:00,6896,"As far as a members only area to get people to sign up we just don't need it at this time. We are not selling anything so whether we have 7000 or 15000 members it is information we are not selling.  The site has only one advertiser and it is Google. We decided a long time ago that we are not running this site to make money it is truly only alive because of the free time and effort of the mod's and owners. We donate our time because it is a place for us to talk and swop stories with our old and new friends. If or when Google does not bring in enough to pay the bills then we will ""resupply"" the kitty from our pockets and pay the bills. We have a wealth of hero's here they are usually unnamed and unsung by their wishes they donate time or products to make the board's presents seen at local charity or worth while events. If we all donated just a little of our time to say Hi to a new member or great post we would go far to smooth the rough spots we seem to hit every once in a while. There are petty wars going on behind the scenes on every forum some here like to make it public some can take it to P.M. and get it resolved without the drama. Funny though the most popular threads are the ones that have conflict in them. We let them go as long as they are in the bounds of the rules and if not it then gets locked. We try to be as liberal as we can be with the rules and while some see it as letting some talk and some not it really is how you are making your point that counts. If we all could realize and keep in mind it isn't personal when we Mod we would have a lot less P.M. grumping and more posted reports on what we all are here for Fishing.  Sorry now back to the topic and Grimace and Musky Mike time for you to go to P.M. please.  Thanks  Art"
700146,adempsey,2012-05-27 20:31:00,1498,"I don't see how a member viewing a post and not replying or contributing is any different than a non-member doing the same thing. So, to me, it's a moot argument.  Besides, the site would likely lose revenue if it went members only unless it was a paid membership.  Why do people have to reply to every thread they read anyway?  Oftentimes people just have nothing to say.  I'd rather have fewer replies than people posting nonsense to increase their post count."

I found this board a while back, checked out a few of the topics, felt like it would be a fun forum to get involved in, and signed up.  I read the terms of use and made note of the rules, especially those regarding topics like ""hot spots,"" and I respect them to the best of my ability.  I live in London and I fish a lot around this area, mainly because I have a young daughter and I can't really get away very much these days.  Many of the places I've mentioned in my past posts are no secret to anyone.  If I happen to stumble on a really good place to fish outside of my regular haunts, I won't broadcast it in the open forums, but will gladly share through PMs/emails to other members if they're interested.  I would expect the same conduct and courtesy from fellow board members if I happened to have questions about fishing opportunities outside of my general area.  Plus, it's fun just to swap stories, because everybody who likes to fish has something unique to share, and that's something that should always be encouraged.  There's a lot to be learned here, much more than just where the fish happen to be biting on any given day...  I guess you have to just leave the doors open and hope for the best as far as new members are concerned.

As the thread went on for quite a while I 'dropped' in to view it several times and eventually chimed in with a post. Then I naturally checked back to see the reaction to my post. So my ratio was maybe 5 or 6 to 1. If I wasn't a member my ratio would have been 5 or 6 to 0, not a huge difference. For anyone but repeat contributors to a given thread the ratio would tend to be at least 2:1 i.e. read, post, check to see reaction to post. I don't think registering to view is going to change these numbers significantly but will cut down on the number of new members.(BTW, I viewed this thread several times before making this post)"

700017,Rich Clemens,2012-05-27 12:00:00,3131,"Just about all of us were ""lurkers"" at one point.  However, we made the decision and hopefully contribute as we can.  If we look for activity, one thing we have to consider is the knowledge of the member and what posting they do.    I'll put myself on the line here.  1).  Am I a marine mechanic ?  Nope.  If it's broke or not working - I'm outta luck. 2).  Am I a car/truck mechanic ?  Nope  (see above). 3).  Do I have knowledge/experience of various waters in Ontario ?  Nope.  I visit the same places each year. 4).  Am I am multi-species fisherman ?  Nope. 5).  Am I a hockey fan ?  Nope 6).  Do I fish a lot each year ?  Nope.  I spend three weeks in Ontario each year.  Back home, I can count on one hand the number of times my boat is in the water - with fingers left over.  And the list could go on.  However, once in a while someone will come on and ask about bodies of water that I have fished.  For these, I try to jump on them either posting here or PM.  Personally, that makes me feel good that I was (or hope I was) able to provide something helpful and informative. With limited fishing trips.  I post when I think I have something positive to offer. I try to post a report each time so as to continue sharing what I can with the very fine members of OFC - which may only be a few times each year.  I've had the distinct pleasure of meeting dozens of members on here at the GTG and even had the opportunity to spend some time fishing with some of these members.  I WOULD NOT trade any of this - at any price.  From some posts here, I agree that we get a lot of great reports and each one, the member is taking the time to share his/her fishing experience and not always a lot of replies.  Funny that how pretty much every new member gets a reponse that we like pictures.  If we really mean that, when the newbie does post, we should acknowledge his/her post when the do.  Something I should be doing a lot more of - but fail to do.  Maybe I am missing the point, but I've been thinking about this thread a bit.   Maybe we need to be a little better at really giving the new members a warm welcome and some on going encouragement.  Rich"

Infact everyone in my family were anglers and we always had boats my entire life and I couldn't even to begin to know how many fishing trips we took. Thing is though, taking pictures of fish was never a priority and was only reserved for an exceptional fish. I fished Quinte for decades but don't think I ever took a picture of a pickeral.  I joined this board about 10 years ago and noticed how everyone was interested in pictures so I posted the few I had of muskies. After that I got a 1/2 decent camera and started taking  pictures to post and continued like that for a few years.  Thing is though, one fish looks just like all the rest and again I lost interest in taking them and only took the odd pic of a bigger fish. I took some pics last year of a couple decent muskies I caught on Nip and posted them for my 1st fishing report in about 3 years.  I still fish lots although not as much as a few years ago, but taking pictures is low on my to-do list.  I'm sure many guys who have been fishing as long as me feel the same and perhaps that's why you don't always see alot of pictures from some members."
700050,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 14:00:00,4661,  i find this interesting....  first that you think so highly of yourself that youll be mobbed at the boat launch...  and second... theses shills you speak of.... YOU will never REALLY know which members do things to be a nice guy or have other motives... like mercman... he speaks very highly of the trips he has taken with me... is that because i give him a deal to do so...?... because he hopes to help his new found friend find success...?... or because he wants to let OFC members know about the great times he has had so they might experience the same...or many other possible reasons... YOU will never know the truth but can make all the assumptions you want... a site as big as this will get members of all sorts with all kinds of reasons for being here... assuming that members are making posts to sell themselves or a product is a crappy way to look at things and i feel bad that you like to see the world around you in this manner... i like to assume the best about people...i like to think everyone here is primarily here to help and share and in the end if that helps them in their work life then thats a bonus for them... i think having business owners that can be considered experts in their line of work around here is very helpful to our members...                 and as far as the OP  if this wasnt a public forum i wouldnt be here... thats for sure... i definatly wouldnt sign up for a forum to read the one article i searched for on google... but google kept showing hits to my searches on the OFC site...and i was getting some really good info... so i figured i should become a member so i could ask as well as answer questions and be a part of a community...   ...

700094,Grimace,2012-05-27 17:09:00,2020,"@Musky Mike.    No I don't think that much of myself that I think I would be mobbed at a boat launch.  That is a ridiculous, assinine, and knowingly false statement by you.  I have been vocal about shills and people that use this site for monetary gain and we have crossed swords here a few times about how I view people promoting their guiding service and taking advantage of the site.  You do not appreciate my view on the subject so you are using hyperbole to try to discredit me.   My commentary was made without you in mind but now that you bring it up I don't believe telling OFNers that you caught 1000 walleye in a season helps anyone catch any fish unless of course they purchase your services as a result of that statement.   Making alot of reports and throwing up pictures all the time with little mention of what techniques were used is considered by many to be an excellent contribution but to me teaching and sharing knowledge of certain situations is more valuable.  Even if there is no pictures.  My idea of what makes a good contributer on this site is different than many others I guess but no less valid.  Promotional staff really get under my skin.  My defense against what I consider to be people taking advantage is done out of respect for this site.  In response to your knowingly false assertion that I think so highly of myself that I would be mobbed at boat launches:  On the contrary, I am the complete opposite, that is the heart of my point.  I just don't want to be recognized anywhere.  There is HUGE amount of traffic here, HUGE.   My comment was related to the amount if traffic this site gets not to any perceived sense of self greatness.  I recognize OFNers at plenty of boat launches and I just don't want to be launching at Port Credit lets say and have half a dozen people know who I am because they lurk on this website.  It would have zero to do with being a good or bad fisherman. It has to do with unwanted exposure on a website with massive amounts of traffic.  My experience here is also greatly enhanced by the PM function.  I share my tips for free.  I think this is a great forum for many reasons. Lots of great info is shared.  I like sharing and recieving tactics for several different species on several different bodies of water so long as it is not too specific to a fishing spot in particular.  This is the essence of a good fishing forum.  Sharing tactics is a more healthy way to promote fishing on the Internet than sharing spots.  I just don't find it necessary plaster my face all over a fishing report.  Like I said, I don't need any, however small, notoriety from it and I have no interest in gaining monetarily from it.  Anyways, I love this site, maybe for different reasons than many others but I love it all the same.  I have gained valuable information here from members and shared it alike and that is what I believe to be the spirit in which it was created.  Cheers."
700108,mike rousseau,2012-05-27 18:04:00,4661, as someone that uses PMs i find it interesting that you assume i dont... i have to clean out my PM box on a regular basis from all the questions members ask me... and i do my best to answer all their questions to the best of my ability... and if i cant give them an answer im confident in... i tell them they should start a thread and see what the other members say...  and as far as how i catch my fish... most people here know 90 percent of my fishing is structure trolling... for musky or walleye... and that i fish the st.lawrence river...  and yes i have some secrets... and i keep these secrets among close friends and family... and im sure a lot of people here have techniques and patterns  that they havent smeared all over the internet...  if your gunna ask what launch i use every day... or ask me to explain in detail my exact pattern and locations i fish... i think im being reasonable in not answering those questions...

700114,Grimace,2012-05-27 18:37:00,2020,"I never said that you didn't use PM's.  I also didn't say that you should be telling people what launch you are using in fact my position on that is, as I have repeatedly stated is just the opposite.  I made a general statement about my OFC experience.  You used that to draw me into a one on one melee with you which I am not going to waste any more time on.  A general statement to the forum  If I became a guide tomorrow (which I will never do) I would have too much respect for this forum to turn around and shamelessly promote myself on it.  There are plenty of guides on this forum that act well within what I believe to be the boundaries of good taste.  A young man on Lake Simcoe comes to mind, as he has been posting reports and helping people from day one, before he was a guide, and now that he is a guide he has altered his postings in a respectful way, even though if he didn't,  I certainly think everyone would look the other way due to his great track record.  A few years back, we had a group of guys guiding on a certain large body of water and when anybody asked a general question was asked that body of water one of them would chime in the thread and just to say ""If you want to catch fish there we would love to take you out for a day of guided fishing PM me or contact me at this number"".  That was, in my mind, one of the most blatant and disrespectful uses of the forum in my recent memory.  That is my position on people selling themselves on the forum.   You want to advertise call TJ and buy a strip, I am sure the price is reasonable, you get to expand your client base and our forum benefits from the help.  Everyone wins.  Cheers."

699667,misfish,2012-05-25 22:54:00,29133,"My thing is,I love to fish and report my days events.Thats what this sites all about) I have tried to cut out the back ground (hate when I have to do that) I,m forced to knell down and show bank shots or fish just on the bank.(not liked by many steelhead anglers,but what to do) My laker reports,well,most know where I live and where the fish are on Simcoe,so what the hell is one to do. I had a few pm,s asking depths and lures. I responded to one local known member."

699670,beagle dad,2012-05-25 22:57:00,224,i have met and fished with cpl of members...my use is to meet like minded individuals who wants to have fun and catch fish..my frustration comes from people who back door info for their own profit i'm not sure sites like this benefit from those that take and dont give back...hence the state of our fisheries..whats left for future generations
699676,lew,2012-05-25 23:05:00,12766,"Doesn't really matter to me one way or the other whether folks are members or not. If they want  free info they can still get it.  Sorta like the rule we have here where you must have 25 posts under your belt before you can advertise in the classifieds. Guys just register, then reply to 25 posts in short order and post their stuff for sale and then they never post again.  Or what about the guys who are only here for their own self promotion ??  They never join a conversation, never post reports, never reply to anything, infact some almost never even come into the main forum page, they just sit in the background promoting themselves.  Some things there's just not much you can do about other than  accept it and go about your own business."
699679,mercman,2012-05-25 23:15:00,7054,  Dang......how d'ya do that......................must be a camera in here somewhere
699724,Roy,2012-05-26 01:06:00,13728, The reason that's there Lew is to stop spam bots from getting in and it works better than anything else we've ever tried.  edited to add: You'll also notice that our newest member is our 8022nd member but his board number is 13175. That's because we screen everyone who comes in here.....40% didn't make the cut. It's the best we can do for the time being.
699725,BillM,2012-05-26 01:15:00,17367,This is why people really need to be aware of what they're posting..  I don't post many threads anymore and this is the reason.   No way I'm giving away info/conditions to someone who's just going to exploit the resource.
699729,Jigger,2012-05-26 01:26:00,1237, This pretty well sums it up for me.
699730,whiskywizard,2012-05-26 01:30:00,305,"Don't forget that many ""lurkers"" are proper members who didn't log in for a given session.    ."
699731,Twocoda,2012-05-26 01:30:00,4130," its about time you fessed up and took responsibility for not packing duct tape for their recent holey canoe scenario...in the words of Donald Trump ""YOUR FIRED! Now get outta here!""    Initially i was going to say this site may need the traffic of the ""lurkers"" to generate more sponsors but i decided not to say that because to quote you B "" My thing is, I love to fish and report my days events"" and for that...thats what makes this forum work as well as it does...i enjoy reading peoples adventures on here and quite impressed with quality of the reports...its all about the fun of our passion and sharing it with each other...if someone learns something along the way...well i guess you get to sleep good at night that you helped out someone you dont even know...(noble gesture)  Keep in mind everyone moves and beats to their own drum...when i found this site and read 6 or 7 threads...i signed up immediately...some others it may take years to climb out of the shadows (if ever) ...i can think of a few people that are members on this forum that have less than 10 posts but are active in reading all the time and been members for years long before me..Some may find it intimidating to compare their writing abilities to some of the others on here...what ever the reason...its their loss that they wont get the satisfaction of sharing the rewards that come with being an active member such as making new friends...personally i havent yet posted a fishing report by choice...but still consider myself an active member that enjoys checking in on a daily basis"
699732,spincast,2012-05-26 01:31:00,3279,"an interesting thought, and I have to admit there are times I am dumbfounded at the views to some posts and the poor reply counts - but where do you draw the line? I see a lot of members who have been members way longer than me, have way fewer  posts than me, but offer a report or opinion once in a while. Many of them quality. How long are you a member without a post before you are cut off? How long in between posts? As an example, one member who has something like 20,000+ posts (and shall go un named but you all know who)   wont be posting for several months becuase he is doing what we would all love to do - turning off the internet, relaxing and fishing. We gonna cut him out? I think like most things in life, take from it what you want and ignore the rest. Give what you want and hopefully it is appreciated.  I have met some great freinds through this place. Two of them before I had really posted anything. Whats that worth? Priceless. You have something you want to show and share, but dont want the lurkers to see? PM your buds, or perhaps use another social media outlet. Its a forum, not a club. just my $0.02 now back to reading those fishing posts."
699733,grimsbylander,2012-05-26 01:38:00,3016,Another site I am a member of mandates that user names be first name last name. No secrets and alias's to hide behind. You also have to be a member to view forums. I'm not saying its better...just different.
699735,Kerry,2012-05-26 01:47:00,383,"Hey Brian, Here's my take.I am probably a lurker more often than not on most boards I am registered on and mostly because I have my computer set to clear everything as soon as I am done a session.Therefore I have to sign in on each and every board,fishing or not if I want to contribute.For the most part I only post when I feel I have a reason to.SO having said that I usually lurk at least once a day and probably view about 30 percent of the daily posts.I might post once a week so my ratio is really 'lurker sided'.For me the reading is more of a daily wind-down and unless something pekes my interest I'll post.So here you go! Kerry"
699736,Dutch,2012-05-26 01:50:00,831,"If a members only section would increase the number of reports, then I would be all for it."
699739,Rod Caster,2012-05-26 02:02:00,5784,"If this wasn't public, we would have a slower board and we'd be without a lot of great members who just happened to stumble upon this site doing a google search. I like the public factor and believe its the reason why OFC attracts so many views/members.  As a personal rule, I like to post as much fishing related stuff as possible, ""good jobs"" and as many reports as possible. I feel that this stuff ""pays"" my way into this community."
699740,Moosebunk,2012-05-26 02:03:00,3970,"It's ""fishing"" that fuels; or should fuel, the OFC engine.  I kinda get what Brian is saying, as you would expect that all angler members fishing and contributing reports should receive the best acknowledgements/feedback for their efforts from those they are willing to ""give"" to.  A no-lurker format could make view numbers and responses to threads a more balanced and personable experience.  Even if people just simply log-in in order to view but never say or contribute anything, then even that still somewhat enhances a membership and helps better define ""community.""  I rarely post nowadays here other than in peoples reports to say thanks, great job, give feedback or ask about something... because A) they made an effort to report, and B.) it's of interest, and C) it's appreciated that they did report and D) because the hope is they will continue to do it.  Surely there are others who when posting a report hope that it's well received and appreciated, and I have always found OFC gracious in that respect with me, but it's not always the case with all others or even as a general rule of thumb.  So that leads to...  ... I would love to see a fishing reports and a general discussion section separate here and I've always thought that OFC could in the very least entertain a trial period for this.  All anglers here contributing to ""fishing experiences"" should not have their moments lost to pages 3,4,5 and beyond, within a few days because ""other"" threads simply wash them away.  Those are peoples proud and/or interesting fishing moments, and threads like someones rant of the day, or some political thread, or news item, or question about home improvements, isn't often IMO as news worthy as say, JohnnyB's recent trip to Temagami, Dan's speckle weekend, Cookslav's trip to Algonquin, Lungelarry's PB 50-incher, Brian's day steelheading... etc.  Personal Fishing reports like that from signed-in members should have a main stage where they remain in the OFC theatre until only the next fishing show earns it's place at the top of the Box Office.  As a ""community,"" visitors (members) here will gain more in fishing and probably friendship.  Such a section to view should also be open only to those signed-in.  Idle topics of lesser interests to the masses (being that we are or should all be here in a sense for ""fishing) should not take away, make less difficult to find or view, or somedays take center-stage over membership contributions in fishing.  I'll be expecting a few to say, ""but it ain't broke so why fix it.""  And they're right... not saying anything is broke.  And neither is my truck, but it still went in the shop today for a check and a tweak and I drove it away feeling that it was going to run better.  Just my $0.02."
699770,Toad Hunter,2012-05-26 04:32:00,261,"I have to ask... is this topic a result of my topic i posted about my new fishfinder, and asking why I had 105 views and no comments ? And I will admit, I have lurked for a while _ but will add it is only because as a new member, I had posted a few questions and got little help, negative feed back etc. so I was discouraged, and have kinda sat back. But now, with my new boat, trailer back in the highlands etc. I look forward to posting some nice reports (that I know we all get off on), and taking advantage of the full benefits this forum can offer by.. maybe becoming a ""regular"" ?? - and well, if I am wrong as to my thoughts on as to why this topic was brought up - I will chalk this up as another case of myown Larry David-esc paranoia as a result of too much times ""in the bush"""
699771,Toad Hunter,2012-05-26 04:37:00,261,"but if I'm RIGHT , than are you not admitting to have lurked yourself ?  jk"
699773,Grimace,2012-05-26 05:14:00,2020,"I will be honest.   I do not post my reports because I do not want to be famous.  lol.  I will PM people as I often do with help but I no longer post reports because this site is just too bloody big and I do not want people to recognize me at the boat launch.  I still try to contribute with advice and help but I do not want to slather pictures of myself here with fish as I have nothing to promote.  I often speak out against the shills on here but am often ridiculed by the sycophants who believe that the Pro (motional not fessional) Staff that shill here are doing it in the best interest of the membership not themselves.  I equate these people with the guy in the strip joint that thinks the broad really likes him.  I respect many people on this board.  I have friends on this board but I think it is just to big to be posting pictures of myself on it.  Like I said, I have nothing to sell.  If I PM you with info. you know it doesn't come at a price.  Cheers"
699789,misfish,2012-05-26 09:53:00,29133,  NO
699791,spincast,2012-05-26 10:07:00,3279,"kind of ironic, huh? This post has more responses than most of our fishing posts"
699792,limeyangler,2012-05-26 10:26:00,5204,  Exactly what i was thinking.
699625,misfish,2012-05-25 21:32:00,29133,"Im seeing a lot of reports that are being viewed,many many times more then replies to the OP. Myself,theres a lot of free loading going on. I,m thinking maybe you should be a member to view. If you are truly into fishing and the outdoors,you should join up to view the contents here.  This is just my opinion.  I take no offence if you disagree."
699627,Big Cliff,2012-05-25 21:35:00,6899,I totally agree! If you aren't willing to contribute then you are not a true OFC member in the spirit of OFC.
699629,beagle dad,2012-05-25 21:37:00,224,in my opinion if ur not willing to contribute and help why bother viewing ...people looking for secrets?  ... i have none...lol
699631,Fisherpete,2012-05-25 21:39:00,1814,"I think that even if we made people take the two minutes to sign up to be able to read posts, most would still just remain as lurkers who just read but don't post..."
699638,Roy,2012-05-25 21:55:00,13728,"That's a good question, Dave. FisherPete has that pegged pretty well. This is the situation as we know it. The number of views vs. the number of replies will never make sense. If I post a fishing report, depending on the time of day, subject title etc...I'll get 5 views. Then someone replies. Once the reply is posted, the 5 people who viewed and myself go back to view the thread again to see what the the reply was. And on it goes. Very soon you end up with 150 views and 4 replies. Very few lurkers come in to read reports because there is just too much to read and they have no search privilege.  So to answer your question, NO, I don't think so.  PS. There are other readers as well....the bots...Google, Yahoo, Bing and the like."
699639,BucktownAngler,2012-05-25 21:55:00,582,I agree definetly.
699640,Christopheraaron,2012-05-25 21:55:00,3525, True but it does discourage.
699641,Big Cliff,2012-05-25 21:55:00,6899," That is why if I am giving someone information I will either PM or email them. I don't post anything specific on the open form anymore. You want to know what is really going on in my neck of the woods. You PM or email me. If you are a contributor I'll reply, if not, forget it!"
699642,BucktownAngler,2012-05-25 21:57:00,582,"  Search priviledge is not needed, you can find anything on google."
699643,BucktownAngler,2012-05-25 22:00:00,582," not necessarily true.  Many times at work i've wanted to post a reply to something, but didnt have my login info handy so i didnt bother.  Im sure people may have wanted to add something or post something, but then realize you have to sign up, and just say ""forget it"""
699644,Roy,2012-05-25 22:01:00,13728, You're right....and that makes the members only thing redundant eh?

699648,Christopheraaron,2012-05-25 22:20:00,3525," Another thing to add, it took me years to join and I admit that I was snooping a bit, it's way more fun actually being on here, and I regret lurking...  I was deterred by signing up"
699650,Roy,2012-05-25 22:22:00,13728," Just one cowgirl would be fine with me, Pete. If they happen to be twins well hey, that's fine too!"
699652,Ralph Field,2012-05-25 22:23:00,1018,"This "" problem"" exists on all forums. There are some forums where people just sign up to be able to buy and sell in the classified section and never post their views, perhaps because they think that they are much better fishermen than the rest of us. Also lurking occurs on all boards and cannot be controlled. I always go back to view what people have said in threads where I have posted a reply as Roy said this is the point of the forum."
699653,beagle dad,2012-05-25 22:25:00,224,notice this topic has 13 replies 0 views.....try topic hot spot on any lake you want...replies low..views sky rocket ...imagine showing up to fishing spot  with 1/3 of views sitting in boats taking bushels of fish home true fishers will meet face to face  and help 1 another..taking from our resources waht is used. not stocked in a freezer....sry  bought this rant but seen happen
699654,Steve,2012-05-25 22:30:00,2075,"only board that i'm part of that doesn't have lurking is a members only/invite only board.  every other public board has lurking. i think it's just part of the deal. if anyone can join and be a member, which is the intent of 95% of internet sites, then you just gotta get used to it.  i don't see how making this a members only board would make it any different."
