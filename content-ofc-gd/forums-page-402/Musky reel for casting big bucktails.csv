700874,robfrawley,2012-05-29 16:53:00,25,"Hey Guys,  Im in the market for a new musky reel. I want something that is ideal for casting big bucktails - double 8's and double 10 cowgirls.  What gear ratio is best recommended? Any certain/ specific reels that are designed exactly for this style of fishing?  I need a left hand retrieve. Budget is around $300 or so.  Any help is greatly appreciated.  Thanks,  Rob"

700922,Gregoire,2012-05-29 18:53:00,1397," If you are looking at a combo to burn bucktails you should be looking at Avet reels. They fit into your price range but are non level wind and have a lever drag, so a bit different from a conventional musky reel. If you want to go more expensive shimano makes an ocea jigger in lefty, but it is 500+. If you just want to pull in big blades easily I would agree with PABMusky and go with the winch. I just bought one and will be using it this weekend. I have heard from several people that it makes pulling in the big blades effortless."

701073,Nipfisher,2012-05-30 01:44:00,2449,I use a Shimano Curado 300DSV. It is a great reel for big bucktails.  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewshimanocurado300dhsvpg3.html
701090,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-30 02:52:00,535,"I use the revo toro winch for bucktails and I like it, has a good feel in your hand as well. Can't burn them really fast but you can cast double 10's all day long with it."
701198,cram,2012-05-30 15:20:00,1733,Just throw double 8s and you won't need to worry about it.
701210,John,2012-05-30 15:51:00,2956,I use a 7001 Abu for larger bucktails and I don't have big hands. Price is right and it does the job.
701215,kickingfrog,2012-05-30 16:18:00,8333,  I believe that reel hasn't been made for a few years now. In my opinion the newer Curados do not measure up and you'll have to pry my 300DSV from my cold dead hands.
701217,bigbuck,2012-05-30 16:26:00,2449,"Abu 7000i. Big, strong with a low gear ratio made up for by a large spool. It can double as your trolling reel."
