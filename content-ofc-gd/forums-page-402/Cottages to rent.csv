BUT we are open to suggestions.  Anyone familiar with the area to make any suggestions of cottages to rent or a nice place to stay ??? The girls want pretty nice accommodation.... they aren't really the ""outdoorsy"" kind of girls ! haha  It would probably be the end of July/early august Time frame.  Any suggestions would be great."
701202,adempsey,2012-05-30 15:29:00,1498,I'd look for a private rental.   My buddy goes up there all the time with his family and rents private cottages.  Plenty of sites that list rentals.  Good luck!  http://www.rentcottage.com/browse_by_area.cfm?area=lions%20head http://www.rentcottage.com/browse_by_area.cfm?area=tobermory http://www.thebrucepeninsula.ca/cottages-for-rent-bruce-peninsula.html?catid=25 http://www.cottageportal.com/SaubleBeachCottageRentals.cfm http://www.cottagesincanada.com/cottage-rentals/ontario/bruce-peninsula-lake-huron
