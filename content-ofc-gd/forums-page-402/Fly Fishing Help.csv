701063,Broker,2012-05-30 01:25:00,482,"Went out on the river tonight after 2 weeks of practising casting in the backyard. Thought I was doing well for until a fish hit , and another , and another and ended up having my fly taken under atleast 7 times. didnt get one fish on. so my question is, when a fish takes the fly under what do i do ? Set the hook ? new to this so any tips would be great help"
701066,BillM,2012-05-30 01:28:00,17367,"Yup, setting the hook might help.  Although with a flyrod it's not like you've gotta drive the hook into their brains.  Just lift up on the rod and you should be good."
701069,monsterfish,2012-05-30 01:34:00,48,Sharpen your hooks!  Always sharpen your Hooks!
701075,timmeh,2012-05-30 01:47:00,609,Also may have been chubs. Sometimes they hit flies but aren't big enough to actually eat them.
701077,Broker,2012-05-30 01:53:00,482,"that could have been what it was, because they were surely not big"
701079,The JAY,2012-05-30 02:01:00,239,"If you were fishing in the Grand, they were probably Mooneye. They hit fast and spit just as quick...."
701081,Broker,2012-05-30 02:10:00,482,"Yeah i was on the grand but i think it was the chubs like timmeh said because they weren't very large, although i have no idea how big mooneye get"
701093,Christopheraaron,2012-05-30 03:00:00,3525,"Wait a few days until the weather cools, the rivers will as well and the trout will become more active. As for setting the hook, just like bill said, just lift the rod tip and be ready for a fight!"
701122,Broker,2012-05-30 11:08:00,482,"Im on the lower grand, so there isnt any active trout. I was just practising for whatever bites"
701126,Christopheraaron,2012-05-30 11:17:00,3525,"Oh, ok. There are supposed to be a lot of silver bass in there right now, maybe you should tie up some small clouser minnows and try for them?"
701128,misfish,2012-05-30 11:44:00,29133, LOL I was chubb fly fishing on the weekend.LOL  Yes the chubb will hit the fly. I was surprised at some. They would hit as soon as the fly hit the water. Very aggrasive.
701131,aplumma,2012-05-30 11:50:00,6896,I found a piece of red yarn and a flock of chicken an excellent way to sharpen your skills in the back yard.  Art
701135,Broker,2012-05-30 12:03:00,482,"going to go again tonight, an see if i can pull one out so i can identify whats been hitting so much"
701137,Christopheraaron,2012-05-30 12:12:00,3525,"Chub, even small ones like small (up to size 8) flies, try a small beadhead wooly bugger and I guarantee you'll catch one."
701144,Broker,2012-05-30 12:18:00,482,haha alright I will try that out tonight! I'll letcha know how I do.
701177,solopaddler,2012-05-30 14:25:00,8605,"Based on your description you were fishing dry flies and susequently had fish strike and take your fly under?  Many many times fish simply prefer to eat flies sub surface, whether it's because they're keying on emergers or for some other unfathomable reason.  Sometimes what appears to be a strike is often the fish slapping at the fly with it's tail or possibly nudging it with its snout to submerge it where they can suck it in at their leisure.  In such instances the obvious answer is use a sub surface fly, usually a nymph of some type.  Alternatively when your dry fly disappears in a showy splash count to three then slowly raise the rod and set the hook. You need to give them a bit more time to eat your fly when they're doing this.  The ultimate example of this for me occurred many years ago when fly fishing for whitefish. I missed over a dozen spectacular hits before it dawned on me what was happening. The whitefish were indeed keying on the mayflies on the surface. But because of their underslung mouth were coming up and submerging the fly with their noses, then sucking them in underwater.  After I figured that out I had to force myself to wait before the lifting the rod...a very hard thing to do...but it worked. I started hooking fish hand over fist."
701260,dave524,2012-05-30 18:27:00,4508," Same here, especially when I was younger and reflexes were faster, would set the hook when the fish broke surface and pull the fly away from it, my solution was to foucus on the nail knot joining the leader to the fly line and only strike after it moved ."
701273,Broker,2012-05-30 19:34:00,482,"Yes thats what happened, and I had no idea what to do because I have been focusing so much on casting I forgot about the other basics haha."
701283,Live2fish85,2012-05-30 20:24:00,1633,"I can almost garuntee that if you are fishing abobe the dunnville dam towards york and caledonia that it is mooneye that are taking the flies. I have been down a few times and some gentlemen that were fly fishing were catching tons of them, said they go down there often as his brother was just learning."
701288,Broker,2012-05-30 20:32:00,482,Guess theres only one way to find out and that is to catch one ! Haha
701304,Christopheraaron,2012-05-30 21:09:00,3525,It may be easier to take spinning gear and drift some worms. Almost all fish take worms and you will have a better chance catching it on spinning gear.
701306,Broker,2012-05-30 21:15:00,482,Yeah but I am trying to figure out fly fishing and catch my first fish on a fly rod. On spinning gear I have a secret spot for walleye which I wouldn't be able to resist going to
701308,misfish,2012-05-30 21:19:00,29133," Some like to do it the easy way Shasta  Good on ya for sticking to the fly. Im a newbi as well. It,s a blast. Rewarding when you can get something on a fly."
701310,Broker,2012-05-30 21:23:00,482,"  I saw your first fly catch, she's a beauty! don't think mine will be as pretty.."
701311,Christopheraaron,2012-05-30 21:24:00,3525,You take that back! I was suggesting that he use worms to figure out what was biting!
