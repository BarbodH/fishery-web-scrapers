701640,Billy Bob,2012-05-31 21:09:00,5865," It is the U.S.A. MARINES who are special in every respect...the first to hit the beach...the first to be dropped behind enemy lines....they are known as ""THE GRUNTS"" who know no pain....they are ""The Few, The PROUD, The MARINES"".....it don't get no better then that.......I have several friends that are MARINES and I worked with a couple of them.....after serving in war time.....they are NOT the average guy walking down the street....they are VERY PROUD soldiers that would still today die for their country....they have my utmost respect....unless you personally know one, you wouldn't know what I'm talking about.....  Years ago I worked with a Joe H. that was a HUGE Marine....not only in heart but also in body......Joe was 6'-5"" tall and over 300 lbs....Joe was also just a couple of years of retirement.....but you would have no idea that he was that old..................Joe wasn't even in my department.....he was a conductor/switchman and at the time we worked at a very small yard that everyone got along......this one day he had something going.....to this day I still don't know what it was....but he couldn't make it in to work that morning but hope to be there ASAP....I answered the phone when he called in.....he asked me if I could cover for him until he could make it in......he was in luck....it was a slow day for me......I did all his work that day as I worked hand in hand with his department on a daily basis and knew their routeen .....Joe finally make it in around 2pm and by that time 99% of his work was done....by then I was off on another assignment at a industry site.....I never said anything to Joe and he never did to me....it was just a courtesy thing between us...I figure he had some kind of medical procedure he didn't want to talk about....  Later that year Joe got a nice settlement from the RR for a previous injury that happen YEARS before I even met the man......instead of just keeping the money he took out EVERYONE and their wife's from his department, including the bosses he worked with in beginning November....plus one guy from the mechanical department...yep, me and my wife to  one of the most expensive restaurants in our area.....and I mean he paid for EVERYTHING....drinks, wine, champagne...dinner and flaming desserts....I felt embarrassed and offered to pay the tip, which would have been $200.....no, it was all on Marine Joe...what I didn't know it was the official Birthday of the USMC...."

They went above and beyond throughout her ordeal. All you ever read is bad press regarding veteran treatment and recovery, some is likley true, most is likely fiction, and nearly all is from earlier conflicts. Our experience was and continues to be the best treatment available from the best doctors with the best equipment. Your family are all Great Americans."

700385,Billy Bob,2012-05-28 12:23:00,5865,"This past Thursday my bride and I made the 400 mile trip to Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Beavercreek, Ohio (near Dayton, Ohio) to celebrate his residency graduation as a doctor with the U.S.A. Air Force.  Capt Tim graduated with Honors and was awarded the Military Excellence Award in his class of 50 residences and another 45 interns graduating.  We had the pleasure to see and meet the Air Force Surgeon General Three Star Lt. General (Dr) Charles B. Green who was at the ceremony to pass on the certificates.......see here if your interested.... http://www.that other site.mil/information/bios/bio.asp?bioid=5613  So it was a Proud Moment for the wife and I as we got to see our son take another great step forward to what he has worked so hard for...  Tim was accepted to do a Fellowship in Washington, DC where he will practicing  and learning his speciality at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland to become the next ""House"" to run a critical care unit for his country.  During Lt Gen Green's Speech we learned that if you arrive at a Air Force Hospital with a pulse you have a 98% chance of survival.....it only takes the Air Force between 20 - 30 minutes to completely set up a hospital anywhere in the world......and the Air Force moved 90,000 patience and have only lost 4 soldiers....not perfect but pretty close to it....  But anyway's here some photo's for those who might be interested in viewing....     "
700389,motv8tr,2012-05-28 12:41:00,2587,"wow, that is no easy feat!!!!  You and your wife have every right to be proud!!!!  Congrats to your son!!!!  Maureen"

700397,Billy Bob,2012-05-28 12:51:00,5865,THANK YOU both.......those are VERY KIND words....  You may notice he's a bit young.....when he graduated from Medical School in Syracuse he was at the time the  youngest doctor in country....but he's still getting a receding hair line....LOL
700399,Ralph Field,2012-05-28 12:54:00,1018,You and your wife have every right to be proud of your son's tremendous accomplishment and his posting at probably the best known military hospital in your nation.

700413,Billy Bob,2012-05-28 13:37:00,5865," The New Walter Reed Hospital is really the Bethesda Naval Hospital....I just learned this past weekend that when they closed the old Walter Reed Hospital they renamed the Bethesda Naval Hospital ""Walter Reed""....if you remember....the old Walter Reed was basically condemned."

700486,NAW,2012-05-28 17:58:00,4022,Wow BB..  That's one heck of an accomplishment. You must be beyond proud!
700531,Cast-Away,2012-05-28 20:38:00,790,"Congratulations Bob! I had a friend in the US Navy do the same thing. He was in the ROTC, they put him through college and then into the Navy as a weapons officer in the back of an F-14. After his first tour was over, he applied to medical school through the Navy and was accepted. After serving for many years he opened an orthopedic practice in Chicago post military. Your military really takes care of those who serve with these fantastic opportunities."

700543,Billy Bob,2012-05-28 20:54:00,5865, Because of his commitment to the Air Force it's been 3 years since we could fish or hunt together......his brother and I miss him on those annual fishing/hunting trips....but there is a  chance now that he's going to settle in for the next 3 years in DC he may be able to come home this deer season....but it's too early right now to know for sure.
