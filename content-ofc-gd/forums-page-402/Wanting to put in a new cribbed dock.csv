Not interested in anything else due to function and esthetics (done my homework). So I am interested in anyone who has had experience with any companies/contractors located in/servicing Seguin Township.  Company/Contractor will be responsible for: Any/all permit requirements. Ensuring all applicable laws and environmental standards are adhered to. Design & cost. Installation & warranty. Must be WSIB compliant and carry liability insurance.  If any members have REPUTABLE & RELIABLE contacts/referrals please PM me. I am interested in late fall or spring 2013 installation.  Regards, Simon"
