The speed looks navigable by waders for the most part so I can check out the narrower stretches but what about from Macdonnell to Eramosa where it's much wider? And from Woodlawn south to the damn? Are these stretches shallow enough to wade through?  The other thing I'm wondering about is where the Speed and Eramosa meet there's The Boathouse which rents out canoes and kayaks. Wondering if it's worth taking my inflatable boat either downstream or upstream from there and fishing. And if so, where I could even blow up and then launch the inflatable? Maybe at Marianne's Park?   Thanks for any info.   If there's no point in boating these rivers maybe I'll try casting from shore in the Speed and then move on to Guelph Lake for some boating."

701519,rhymobot,2012-05-31 14:55:00,174, Thanks but which dam do you mean? The one south of Woodlawn beside the baseball diamonds?
