700439,johnnyb,2012-05-28 15:10:00,3413,"As many of you know, I'm lucky enough to have in-laws with a cottage on Gull Lake, near Minden. As many of you also know, I have been UNlucky enough not to land a laker over the slot limit.    ...    ...    Until now!!! Started things out right this year, as I finally got a chance to get back to the in-law's cottage for the first time this year. (No...that's not true...trolled the lake in early spring...but it was a skunfest which I have repressed until now)  Saturday morning I was up early, and had the rigger, rod-holder and sonar clamped to the boat by 6. Surface temps were already up in the mid 60's, and I had a nice section of 40' flat in mind that produced lakers in early summer for me last year.  By 6:25 I had this guy in the boat -- a solid 24 inches of slot-busting laker!!!        Trolled around until 9, but could only get one more hit, which shook itself off on the way up. Nice way to start the season though!    "
700464,Dan668,2012-05-28 16:21:00,1120,Congrats. I landed one over the slot last week. First time on that lake. Only fished for 2 hours. The rest of my friends wanted to swim and cruise instead
700471,beagle dad,2012-05-28 16:47:00,224,NICE FISH!!!  HAVE FISHED THAT LAKE NUMEROUS TIMES  NEVER HAD MUCH LUCK WITH RIGGERS ...HOWEVER HAVE CAUGHT MANY LAKERS NOT IN SLOT WITH STEEL LINE I FIND THAT MANY OF THE BIG FISH IN 30-50 FT OF WATER
700477,jimmer,2012-05-28 17:15:00,2730,Nice one John! I'm kicking myself for not getting out for lakers this spring. Walleye are a nice replacement though.
700517,Joeytier,2012-05-28 20:20:00,3990,That thing is FAT!
700618,RickOnt,2012-05-28 23:54:00,669,"Hey Johnny  He will go ""Nice"" on the BBQ  Rick"
700674,Moosebunk,2012-05-29 02:31:00,3970,Holy Moly Johnny B... that laker is nearly as warped as you are.
700783,johnnyb,2012-05-29 14:05:00,3413,I do confess to using the laker as a drift sock...that second pic is light on the EAP and heavy on the WLF (water logged fish)  I'm glad he was over the slot though....pretty much bled to death in the boat just getting the hooks out....absolutely inhaled the spoon and had a case of treble-itis in the gill-ular region
700786,steverowbotham,2012-05-29 14:06:00,1800,nice greaser!  Gotta love those dartees
701085,Rod Caster,2012-05-30 02:31:00,5784,Either you have a small head or its got a huge mouth or your holding it way out. Haha.  Nice catch!! Beats my pb laker hands down
701086,BillM,2012-05-30 02:37:00,17367,"I have a feeling that fish isn't going to taste very good, lol."
701087,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-05-30 02:39:00,535,Great catch! Makes me want to try for Lakers again this year.
701136,12footspringbok,2012-05-30 12:07:00,459,Nothing I look more forward to than trolling for some grease on a nice summer day...  Thanks for sharing
701192,johnnyb,2012-05-30 15:00:00,3413," Little bit of EAP going on....but it did have a good sized maw    I admit, it looks horrible in that last shot off the dock....but the flesh was pale orange...got smothered in some montreal steak spice, sweet chili peppers, slapped on the grill and drizzled with syrup.  Went down just fine"
701195,Harrison,2012-05-30 15:08:00,2202,Syrup as in Maple?
701196,johnnyb,2012-05-30 15:15:00,3413,
701201,dave524,2012-05-30 15:23:00,4508," Nice fish, when my folks had the place in Haliburton we used to get a few Bows mixed in with the Lakers in the spring, they had the most orange flesh of any bow I've caught. If you can figure out a summer pattern for them they would be a good addition to the menue. We always got them where the Gull River dumped in the lake at the north end, but early like May 24 weekend."
701209,BillM,2012-05-30 15:50:00,17367,"Johnny, I'd eat dog food with maple syrup on it!  LOL!"
701211,johnnyb,2012-05-30 15:57:00,3413,  I have a feeling there are a ton of species to be caught where the river flows in....I've heard of many different surprises....would be amazing to pull in a bow!  Sounds like some evening flatline trolls are in order this summer....
701272,misfish,2012-05-30 19:32:00,29133,Nice fattie John. Well done.
