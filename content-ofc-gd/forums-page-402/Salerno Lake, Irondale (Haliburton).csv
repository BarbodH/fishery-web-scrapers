I've recently become a cottage owner on Salerno Lake in Irondale (between Kinmount and Gooderham).  Has anyone fished the lake? Any experiences and/or wisdom you can share would be greatly appreciated.  Cheers."
701219,NAW,2012-05-30 16:36:00,4022,I've never fished the lake.  Welcome aboard though!

701224,John,2012-05-30 16:49:00,2956,Welcome aboard. Not sure this would be a destination lake for most on this board unless you have a cottage there. Small lake but appears to have a healthy population of most sought after species. Google is your friend....

701239,Fish4Eyes,2012-05-30 17:37:00,1022,"My friends dad owns a cottage on the lake and I have fished it several times. He is very friendly and i'm sure you will run into him sooner than later as he talks to everyone on the lake. His name is Miro, tell him Ned says hi if you see him. I have never fished a lake that is so deep so close to the shore, almost around the entire perimeter of the lake too. Your in 25' 10-15' away from the shore. Good part is there is not many hazards on the water because of this. PM me for more details with regards to the fishing."
