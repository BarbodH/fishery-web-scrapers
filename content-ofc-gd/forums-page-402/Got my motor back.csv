701664,mike rousseau,2012-05-31 21:52:00,4661,Finally got my boat back from the mechanic...  After changing the head gasket without results... He decided to replace several other gaskets... And apparently with a Honda you have to pretty well completely tear apart the entire outboard to work on it... I guess at one point there was only about 10% of the motor left on the boat...  Anyways... Took it for a good rip after I picked It up today and all seems good... Did about a 5km run at WOT and no issues... Then I slowed down and trolled for 20 minutes and she's purring.....  I'm just so glad to have my boat back...

701669,workwear,2012-05-31 22:16:00,592,great news mike!!!.....ever find out what was wrong with it??
701671,mike rousseau,2012-05-31 22:18:00,4661,He figures at one point it might have overheated damaging one or more gaskets... So he changed a bunch of mojor gaskets in the power head i guess and it seems  to have worked...
701672,mike rousseau,2012-05-31 22:19:00,4661,Also he said the timing was off  And he had to adjust the carbs as well...
