I had been moving between ottawa and toronto a fair bit so it was the best option for a 'home' phone service (especially for a student that has been cell phone free since 2003). With the VOIP service I was also able to use the service at any cottage or hotel in North America that provided free internet ....Just a note in case you are considering the VOIP service, the modem they provide is a little bulky but still mobile if you choose to carry it along when ever you travel. Thats my 2 cents...  Oh! customer service has been pretty decent. Have not had to yell at anyone the way my folks and siblings do with Rogers and Bell on a regular basis.  Cheers!"
