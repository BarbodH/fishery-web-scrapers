I have a buddy who is looking to work up north (lives in london and wants to maintain it as a base). I have tried to help him look for jobs, but apart from the odd job on the HRDC website, we are clueless as to what companies operate up North. I am talking about mining etc, he has an excavator licence.  Could anybody enlighten us to what the main mining companies (or anything else) up north are? Any info would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Doug.  P.S, I haven't been fishing and won't be until bass opener, but I continue to live vicariously through all the reports on here"

701749,Nipfisher,2012-06-01 02:26:00,2449,"Check into the Seegmiller Group of companies. They are located in Kitchener but have recently bought out several smaller companies in the North. Last year they bought the company I was working for called Bruman Construction and Leasing.    This year they successfully bid on a 17 million dollar job to repair and resurface part of Hiughway 11 N around Sundridge. They will definately need machine operators.   Also try Kirkland Gold Inc. in Kirkland Lake, and Au Rico Gold in Matachewan. There are tons of mines in the Kirkland Lake, Larder Lake areas and also around Timmins."
