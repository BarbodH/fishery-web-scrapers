700986,misfish,2012-05-29 21:13:00,29133, And G did a fine job.
700992,mistaredone,2012-05-29 21:48:00,913,Sweet rig!!  Looks well put together. Enjoy.
700995,Joey,2012-05-29 21:54:00,9122,"Congrats, she's a beaut and I'm sure will bring you years of enjoyable fishing"
700998,whiskywizard,2012-05-29 22:00:00,305,"According to the manual, it looks like the 2011 40HP etec is NMEA 2000 ready. With an interface cable, you can connect to a NMEA 2000 backbone and feed that into the Lowrance plotter. It will display engine data.  ===================  From page 44 of the ETEC 40hp 2011 owners manual:IMPORTANT: Your outboard may be equipped with an optional engine monitoring system such as I-Command, SystemCheck,or equivalent. The engine monitoring system warns you of conditions that could damage your outboard. The monitoring system consists of a dashmounted gauge, a warning horn, sensors on the engine and oil tank, and related wiring. The system is compatible with the Evinrude Modular Wiring System (MWS) or can be connected to an I-Command system, or other NMEA 2000 compliant CANbus instruments. GAUGES Gauges are available in several styles, such as a digital I-Command gauge with LCD displays or a basic SystemCheck gauge. 1. Typical I-Command Digital gauge 2. Typical SystemCheck gauge Function The EMM activates the warning horn and the gauge displays as follows: • LOW OIL means that oil in the tank is at reserve level (about 1/4 full). • NO OIL indicates an oil delivery problem such as an empty oil tank or damaged oil system. • WATER TEMP or HOT indicates an engine or EMM overheat condition. • CHECK ENGINE or FAULT is used to indicate other fault conditions identified by the EMM. For I-Command and other gauges, refer to the gauge user’s guide for gauge displays, operation, warnings, and monitoring instructions. SYSTEM SELF-TEST During engine start-up, pause with the key switch in the ON position. The monitoring system self-tests by sounding a half-second beep. SystemCheck gauges self-test by turning the indicator lights on simultaneously, then off in sequence. IMPORTANT: If the self-test does not happen as stated, see your Dealer. ENGINE MONITOR WARNINGS Engine monitor system warnings activate the horn for 10 seconds and the appropriate gauge light for a minimum of 30 seconds, or until alarm is acknowledged. If the failure is momentary (for example, oil moving in the tank), the engine monitor gauge light or display may remain ON for a full 30 seconds before going out. If the unsafe operating condition continues, a light or display remains ON until the key is turned OFF or the failure is corrected. The warning will reoccur at the next startup if the problem is not corrected. If the EMM senses a problem could cause permanent engine damage, it will also limit engine speed to 1200 RPM. This additional protection feature is referred to as S.A.F.E. (Speed Adjusting Failsafe Electronics). If the engine was running faster than 1200 RPM when the S.A.F.E. mode activated, it will shake noticeably. Under certain operating conditions the EMM will shut OFF the engine.   "
700999,aplumma,2012-05-29 22:04:00,6896,I was born wrong for that thing it is a right handed tiller.   Very cool boat congratulations.   Art
701000,Rich Clemens,2012-05-29 22:04:00,3131,Sweet.   Kinda like the layout inside.  Sounds like you're gonna have a great set up when your all said and done.    Congrats.
701013,Djeep,2012-05-29 22:49:00,199,looks awesome man
701016,hoby5,2012-05-29 22:56:00,42,congratz beauty of a rig
701148,Lunker777,2012-05-30 12:26:00,866,"Thanks everyone !!!!  I was talkin with Jos @ angling outfitters and he has talked me out of the 80# and into a 55# thrust. Im going to try it for a couple weeks and if I dont like it, I can swap it for the difference.  Im really leary of a 55# thrust.... but my boat only weighs approx 1000lbs... plus my gear and two people... so around 1500lbs. I think a 55# should handle that all day long.... also, Ill be running a dual battery 12V system."
701149,lew,2012-05-30 12:30:00,12766,"I'd go with the 80, there's no such thing as too much power."
701151,Harrison,2012-05-30 12:32:00,2202, x2
701155,Gerritt,2012-05-30 12:48:00,6129,I had a 55lb Minnkota on my 1778... and on a breezy day boat control was difficult... it is a Wide boat and has alot of surface area.... I would go with the 80lb to save yourself alot of headaches. This comes from personal experience.  on a side note... make sure you are pulling the 2 additional plugs from the rear (3 Total) after every outing.... they tend to get water in them.   G
701179,ccmtcanada,2012-05-30 14:30:00,7971,Now that is a SWEET looking ride!! Congrats!!
701220,bigbuck,2012-05-30 16:39:00,2449,"Nice ride. Get'r slimed up reeeeal good! BTW, go with the biggest trolling motor you can afford. You WON'T regret it."
701223,Millhouse2020,2012-05-30 16:44:00,152,Beautiful machine!  I think you will be impressed with the E-Tec and its power.  I would also have to agree to go with the most powerful trolling motor you can get as well.
700818,Lunker777,2012-05-29 15:32:00,866,"Hey everyone ... FINALLY got to pick up the new boat last Friday night, (after about 2 1/2 months ) I spent all day Saturday installing the F/F and adjusting a few things. I took her out Sunday morning bright and early for the maiden voyage.  I was able to reach 32mph with myself and my FIL & gear in the boat. It handles very well and is nice and stable in the rough water we had Sunday.  Im awaiting a 80# Terrova w/ I pilot. & another HDS7.  now on to the pics...  Out with the old !!!!! 14.5ft Springbok, 18HP merc. The whole package was about 30+ years old... dings, dents, cracks, you name it. But it last 3 seasons... and it was my gateway to fishing and getting on the water. There was no more shore fishing for me once this little beast came around. It will be missed............. NOT !!!!!!    And in with the NEW !!! 2012 Polar Kraft 1778WT w/ 40HP E-tec. Two HDS7's, 80# Terrova ( on back order )            Leaving the launch after the maiden voyage     There is still some setup I need to do, Install the second HDS7,  and mount the trolling motor/ batteries, I would like to possibly come up with a second floor to drop in over the factory floor so I can mount some seat bases for a casting seat. The factory floor isn'y really think enough for mounting pedestal seats.  Thanks for looking.... any questions.. ask !!"
700820,BFSC Kevin,2012-05-29 15:33:00,1351,i love it. grats
700822,BFSC Kevin,2012-05-29 15:36:00,1351,is the etec connected to the hds? that way it can show all the information of your motor
700823,johnnyb,2012-05-29 15:37:00,3413,Beautiful rig....very nice upgrade!  Lookin' forward to seeing some pics with slime
700829,Lunker777,2012-05-29 15:43:00,866, Thanks !!!  I went in and asked the dealer yesterday and he told me either 90HP or 115HP and up ONLY  I wish I could though
700830,Lunker777,2012-05-29 15:44:00,866," Thanks.... already got some slime on her, but I didnt take any pics...  haha"

700853,bdox,2012-05-29 16:15:00,329," Sweet rig and truck. Interesting design on the transom, with the motor set forward like that. I will have to add this hull to my list of hulls to research."
700864,mercman,2012-05-29 16:33:00,7054,Nice ride Dude !!! Congrats  No go git er slimed !!!!!
700869,Lunker777,2012-05-29 16:43:00,866," The ""pontoons"" are filled with foam and the idea of it is to get the boat planed out faster. They ARE NOT water tight though... :/"
700873,curlrap,2012-05-29 16:52:00,58,What pitch do you have on your prop. I have a 15 pitch on my Tracker Super Guide and average 28 mph with my 40 e-tech.
700900,Lunker777,2012-05-29 17:47:00,866, I believe its a 13 pitch ?  I want to see what it'll do with just myself and flat water.
700909,DaveMc,2012-05-29 18:07:00,89,"Hey Ty, nice boat, have fun with the back order on the 80 terrova LOL talking to the rep last week about getting one for my new ride and he said they cant keep them in, their flying out the doors faster than they are coming in right now LOL"
700923,RangerGuy,2012-05-29 18:53:00,564,Awesome rig man! I looked at polar kraft 20' Outlander.. they look like a very well built boat.  To be totally honest the only reason I didn't get one is the size.. I felt it was to big to handle by myself in a wind when duck hunting.   Your gonna love it..
700941,misfish,2012-05-29 19:44:00,29133,I really like that.  Care to share the price? Pm if you like.
