701797,12footspringbok,2012-06-01 11:18:00,459,I caught a massive bowfin last weekend the thing was at least 10 pounds... My fishing partner asked if I wanted it netted...   I woulda cut my line if it didn't have my a 12 dollar lure hanging out of it mouth. In hindsite i really should have taken a pictutre of it...  It was kinda cool looking in a scary way.
