Sure enough not long into our afternoon troll they came over to us. We reel in, cause they usually want to see what your using and other members from our group said they came aboard and did an intense search.  I place my rod over the side of the boat while they talked to us - very friendly btw - ""We're doing a survey, how many have you caught.......""  whammo my rod folds over, worm harness 5 feet behind the boat got slammed by a 22.5"" wally eye. Suspended fish was the lesson and a good laugh from the game warden.  The thing that got me was that he very strongly suggested that I keep the fish, legal yes, but bigger then I would like to keep.  None the less it's good to see my fishing fees ""at work""!    Side note: No figure 8 was used, but I hope to this weekend!"
700862,johnnyb,2012-05-29 16:29:00,3413,"Nice timing on the fish....and nice to see the MNR doing the rounds.  22.5 is a great keeper...cut out the dark line and it's delicious!  I was leary about keeping 26 and 27's, but not after grilling them up"
700904,mirogak,2012-05-29 17:53:00,387,What dark line?
700927,Pikeslayer,2012-05-29 19:00:00,1443," AKA the bloodline.   <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/9IiqUo8rNoA"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>   Instead of 'pinching', I start with a couple of small cuts with the filet knife.  Slayer"
700947,misfish,2012-05-29 19:51:00,29133,That was very cool.
700954,Joeytier,2012-05-29 20:02:00,3990,"Very cool story.  Walleye that size are usually bigger than what I would keep anywhere else, but on Quinte they're pretty well ideal.  Some days it's tough to find any that are smaller than that."
701095,mirogak,2012-05-30 03:13:00,387,Wow .. I never knew that.  Thanks bud.  Good to know.
701178,Homer Is King,2012-05-30 14:27:00,305,"Perfect Timing!!  I agree, I love to see the MNR out."
701182,jedimaster,2012-05-30 14:33:00,3472,Thats how I have been doing my waleye fillets for a long time.
