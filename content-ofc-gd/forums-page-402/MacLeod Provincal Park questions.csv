After doing a little research I figure my plan is to leave Mississauga on Thursday June 21st at about 5am to arrive at MacLeod Provincal Park at around 5-6pm (The park is just south of Gearlton off highway 11 about 4 hours east of Thunder Bay). The question I have is the Provincal Parks website left a few key points of information out of their park description. Most specificly when the front office closes to be able to book a campsite and how busy the park tends to be (Its first come first serve or campsites.)  Has anyone in the OFC community been before or know of anyone who has been before? I'm just worried I'll get there, be out of luck for a site and then have to spring for a Gearlton hotel room or drive back to Hearst for a campsite.  PS - Fishing report is most definatly to follow."
701279,johnnyb,2012-05-30 20:11:00,3413,I find with the northern parks it's easier just to call them directly and get the info.
701331,Acountdeleted,2012-05-30 22:52:00,2562,"Good call, I was hoping though someone had gone before just to fill me in if the sites were any good, if they took good care of the park. etc. All that stuff they probabally won't tell me by calling."

Of the three parks that we quickly toured in that area I'd rate Nagagamisis as the nicest then Fushimi, then Macleod. Didn't actually stay at any of them but drove around them to look at the campsite talk to the rangers and any campers. The fishing from the people we talked to was probably the best at Fushimi."
701399,Acountdeleted,2012-05-31 03:32:00,2562,  Awesome. Thanks for the heads up. I'm definatally going to look Fushimi up now.
