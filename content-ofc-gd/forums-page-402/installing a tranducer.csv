700789,JorgeCarlos,2012-05-29 14:10:00,109,"i was thinking to install the transducer on the inside of the hull,will i lose the water temp on the fishfinder or i will still see it?? thanks all"
700793,BillM,2012-05-29 14:19:00,17367,Why on the inside?
700808,JorgeCarlos,2012-05-29 14:53:00,109,"i went to bass pro yesterday and the worker at service dept said i dont need to make no holes on the boat, and the transon is not straight, is a in/outboard motor, boat is a tahoe Q5 fishing."
700809,BillM,2012-05-29 14:57:00,17367,"I wouldn't listen to him...  It doesn't matter if the transom isn't straight (None of them are), you can rotate the transducer so it's sitting horizontal..."
700810,whiskywizard,2012-05-29 15:03:00,305,"There are some real advantages to mounting a transducer inside the hull on a fibreglass boat.  The depth sounder signal will pass through the 'glass without a problem, as long as the hull isn't cored. Your temperature sender will work, but it will be slightly slower responding to changes in water temperature. It will take a few seconds for the hull to adjust to lake temp.  If you decide to go this way, there are few important steps to take as you plan and execute the installation. None are difficult."

701370,Terry,2012-05-31 01:46:00,14456,mount it inside and forget about it..it will work great'  sometimes salesmen do know what they are talking about
701426,Stoty,2012-05-31 09:37:00,2910, Yup! Totally agree with Terry! My Nitro's ducer is on the inside and temp gauge works great.   Edit: typo
