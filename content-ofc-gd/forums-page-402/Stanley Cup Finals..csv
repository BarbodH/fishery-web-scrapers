699753,Nipfisher,2012-05-26 02:55:00,2449,What do you think? I'll take Kings in 6. What a strange play-offs this has been.
699754,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-26 02:57:00,2690,"Marty vs Quick, bring it on!!!!"
699757,rickster,2012-05-26 03:08:00,495,devils in six.....maybe seven
699760,Rod Caster,2012-05-26 03:12:00,5784,I'd love to see brodeur hold up another lord stanley.
699761,Dan668,2012-05-26 03:21:00,1120,Devils
699762,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-26 03:40:00,10439,  Tough to call but I say Kings in 6.
699766,Stoty,2012-05-26 04:12:00,2910,"Kings in 6  Gonna be a great series for sure! NYR are WAY too boring to watch, IMO."
699775,Toad Hunter,2012-05-26 06:20:00,261,"As a rangers fan - I feel obligated to hope the devils take it, least then I can say ""beaten by the best"" - now, realistically, I think the Kings got it- only team that's been clean all the way thru."
699787,davey buoy,2012-05-26 09:28:00,5505,"LA in 6 as well. Large, solid well coached team."
699809,Rizzo,2012-05-26 11:42:00,4754,"I know nothing about LA, but after seeing them in the first round they became my choice...not gonna change my mind now."
699814,Christopheraaron,2012-05-26 12:29:00,3525,"Kings in 4, long shot ya, but if they're going to win anyway might as well go for the long shot."
699833,Jigger,2012-05-26 14:29:00,1237,"Im on the Brodeur bandwagon this year. Would love to see him raise the Cup one last time. Boy, how good would Parise look in Blue and White? Thats going to be a large tab for some team to pick up either way.  The Kings have looked incredible so far though. Very deep team and some incredible talent.  Im gonna say itll be a goaltender battle with the Marty of old prevailing in 7."
699848,tb4me,2012-05-26 16:24:00,3295,"Hey as a Leaf fan I say go Devils go...I have a tad bit of trivia for ya all..Who was the last man from Brantford Ontario to get the game winning goal, to hoist his team into the Stanley Cup fianls? Thats Easy Adam Henrique, thats who! Way to go kid!   As for Brodeur, id love to see the man hoist lord Stanleys mug once more..I say down with the kings....."
699853,Grimace,2012-05-26 16:54:00,2020,Being a Guelph Storm fan I am rooting for LA.  Doughty and Brown are former Storm.  Callahan and Girardi are out.   I was not fond of New York's style anyways.   I have a great deal of respect for Pete DeBoer it would be nice to see him raise the cup.   Kovalchuk has turned into an all around player and is very impressive.  Both teams are great stories and that makes for an interesting cup finals.  I think it is absolutely laughable that they are not starting the series until Wednesday.
700344,Stoty,2012-05-28 03:26:00,2910,Brodeur has already hoisted the cup... it's time for a changing of the guard and give Quick his first! He's def gonna be one of the league's best goalies for many years to come!
700579,Pikeslayer,2012-05-28 22:28:00,1443,My team wins every year. GO.................GO!!!!
700599,Jacob,2012-05-28 23:24:00,186,"Kings in 7 all the way, they deserve it, beating out all of the top teams in their conference."
700601,Rod Caster,2012-05-28 23:30:00,5784, X2  Devils in 6
700642,muskymatt,2012-05-29 01:03:00,2608,If the Laff fans are pulling for Jersey then it's go Kings for me!!  
700695,Stoty,2012-05-29 04:03:00,2910," That means the Leafs will sign him in about 14 years then! And trade their 1st and 2nd round picks for him at the tender age of 45, LMAO!!!!"
700700,davey buoy,2012-05-29 08:14:00,5505, Isn't that the truth!!!!!!
701014,hoby5,2012-05-29 22:53:00,42,Devils in 6
