I know I will be over 4500 kg, do i have to get a CVOR number registered for my business or is annual safety for truck and trailer and  a logged walk around sufficient.  Thanks,  Bryan"

701779,Skipper D,2012-06-01 09:45:00,1970,"  You answered all your own questions Bryan , except the daily inspection walk around is a must no matter how you registered but you still fall under all the other rules that come with owning a commercial vehicle  , 4500 kg 's and under means you don't have to do the daily trip log book and no CVOR is needed , any thing over 4500kg's you need to have all of the above . This is how i was give their law to me by them , any vehicle i have here registered at 4500kg's is not listed on my ministry of transportation carrier fleet list , every vehicle that i have 4600 kg's and over is . Hope this coen sides with your pm's ."
