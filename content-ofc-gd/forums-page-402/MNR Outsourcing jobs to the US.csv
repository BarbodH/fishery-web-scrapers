Essentially, since January, our hunting and fishing license information are being kept by a company in Tennessee, called Active Outdoors. Personally, it's such a bone headed move and how this got around in the first place is completely lost to me.  There are countless issues at hand, but for the most part, our privacy may be at jeopardy due to the American's Patriotic Act and also the fact we're outsourcing jobs from Ontario to the US.  Anyhow, you could read a bit about it here or Google it for other sources.  http://www.thestar.c...g-deal-with-u-s"
