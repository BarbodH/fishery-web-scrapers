700744,Jer,2012-05-29 12:35:00,1426,"I've had a few tussles with some hooks over the years...  The first was when my buddy managed to hook the back of my neck with a spoon on his backcast. I felt a whack on the back of my head and at first thought he had just hooked my hat, there was no pain. When I removed my hat, the line was right through the adjustment hole at the back with the lure firmly imbedded in my neck. After a few minutes with my buddies tugging and pulling to no effect, off to the hospital we went. I could hear the giggles from people behind me in line once they noticed the shiny gold spoon hanging from the back of my head. Removal was painless at the ER.  Another trip was cut short at the dock when my buddy managed to hook his finger real bad simply putting his rods in the boat, off to the ER he went.  I've removed a couple myself by pushing the point through, cutting the shank and pulling the hook through. One on my thigh, another in my hand.  The worst by far though, was while poorly handling a small musky. It thrashed while trying to remove the hooks and, for just a brief moment, was attached to my arm by the second treble on the lure. The fish came off on it's own and I was left with a very large hook firmly imbedded in my forearm. We made the mistake of cutting the shank before we had the point coming back through and after a few minutes of fiddling managed to lose the entire hook inside my arm. Needless to say, off to the ER once again. They had to X-ray my arm to locate the hook and still the doctor had a heck of a time finding it while digging around in there, even threatening to leave it in as he was getting frustrated. Eventually he got the hook and removed it. He had to slice me for 4 stitches that time."

700952,doubleheader,2012-05-29 19:58:00,497,"I've never buried a hook in myself, close a few times but been lucky. I've had others in the boat do it, no big deal, humans are rational, you can talk to them, dogs on the other hand..... I was fishing musky by myself with my lab. I headed to camp for a quick lunch and thought my two rods were in a safe place, even though I had left big stick baits on them. My lab tripped on the handles running to the bow, the rods tumbled forward , and she had hooks from two different lures buried in her paw. She started yelping and trying to jump away. No one was around to help, I kept her calm enough to first unhook the lures then unscrew the hooks. My cutters were in the back of the boat though, so I just sat there with her for about 30 minutes, afraid to leave the dog alone for that she would get hooked in the the mouth trying to pull them out. Finally this little kid came walking by. He was good enough to go get some help. within a couple minutes his dad showed up, handed me my cutters and I cut off the hooks. They were fortunately both already protruding thru the paw so it was a simple cut and pull. By the end of this ordeal I was a mess, my lab jumped off the boat and went swimming. She never even limped. Never again will I leave musky baits on an unused rod in my boat."

I was paddling with the rod stashed at the stern but with the lure still on the line. In the process of landing I hooked my hand. Fortunately, my friend Howard who is very patient, prepared and methodical had a pair of mini pliers in his kit. He very slowly worked it back out the way it went in----fairly painless."

701098,rufus,2012-05-30 03:47:00,267,"I have had a few hooks stuck in me over the years. The worst incident resulted in the scar in the photo.    I had caught a large pike which I was holding in one hand while attempting to remove the Canadian Wiggler with the other. It started thrashing and I ended up with one of the hooks buried in my hand. The whole hook was in right up around the bend and the point and barb were deep in my hand. There was no way I was going to be able to get that hook out myself and the fish was still thrashing. I had a 12 lb fish attached to a hook that was embedded in my hand. All I could do was snip the hook off and since it was so deep, when I cut it right where the 3 hooks in the treble all come together there was only about 1/4 inch of the hook sticking out of my hand.  After a 3 hour wait in the hospital my hand had swelled up and the hook had completely disappeared in my hand. The only choice the Dr. had was to cut it out.  I was advised to never cut off a hook and to come in with the whole lure attached. That wasn't really an option  in my case because of the thrashing pike nailed to my left hand. The best option t the time was to get him off me as quick as possible. "

Cause he only used baitcasters for fishing and as a youngster they can be tricky to use...  So anyways...  I got a bad tangle with my brother one day perch fishing...  Well after 20 minutes or so of dad trying to untangle the mess and me totally zoned out daydreaming...  Don't I feel a tug on my line...  I think you can see where this is going...  So I sets the hook as hard as I can.... Amazingly dad wasn't hooked... But I'll never....ever... Forget the look I got from him...  It just felt like such a good bite...lol

It was getting near dark and I started putting loose tackle back in the boxes. My brother was standing up front casting a rapala J13. He made his cast and on the backswing the rear treble hook caught me in the eyelid, luckily it didn't hit my eyeball! My dad ended up having to cut it out as the barb had penetrated the skin. All we had was a large filet knife that he used while resting it between his thumb and forefinger. To be honest I was terrified that I wouldn't be able to see and my brother was so upset that he vomited. Everything turned out alright and I ended up with a good story to tell."

700438,Musky or Specks,2012-05-28 14:51:00,2710,"I've buried a hook in myself so many times removing it is like blowing my nose. First time it was a rapala in my calf climbing down a steep hill when I was sixteen. Removed by a doctor after a 3 hour wait. Next time was first day in residence at the University of Windsor. Couldn't wait to get down and fish under the Ambassador Bridge. One of my little plano tackle boxes had spilled in my duffle and when I reached in BAM Mepps embedded in my hand. Hook removed after a 2 hour wait by campus doctor. Both times they gave me a local and just pushed the point through, cut off the barb and removed the hook. Next time it happened I had caught a snot rocket and was holding him behind the head when he slipped out of my hand and the rapala with pike still attached and thrashing went into the web of my thumb and index finger. I decided I wasn't waiting all that time for a DR to remove it so just pushed the barb through myself cut the hook right there on the side of the river and kept on fishing. Now I mostly fish barbless not only do the fish release easier but so do I."

Literally first cast he hooked his drunken self in the arse. He honestly beleived he hooked into a fish and was trying to set the hook and each time he yelped. Must of set 3 times then the line broke.  Thought I was going to die of laughter, I can barely type this as I remember.  Then he turned to me with this paniced look and said and I quote ""I lost it, I think it was huge, do you see it?""  I was out of commission for a good 15 minutes.  You can't make that up.  Off to Barrys Bay hospital, good thing we took him while he was still numb."
700450,backbay,2012-05-28 15:29:00,773,"I too, have done it far more times than I care to admit! Two times come immediately to mind, though. A few years ago, I was attaching a lure to the hook holder, when it slipped/missed, whatever, and embedded a hook well past the barb, as my medium weight rod sprung itself straight. No way was I going trek to Parry Sound, and ruin the afternoon, so I set about removing the thing, grabbing the pliers to get it out. No dice, as no matter how I hauled, the pain overcame my efforts, when I tried to pull it out. Off to the cottage to enlist the aid of my best friend, using the line around the shank and yank method. He took one look at me, and all but fainted, tough guy that he is. I worked on it for a while longer, and finally, we decided to consult a retired doctor we knew of who cottaged not far away. When we arrived at his place, a dock party was in full swing. We had phoned before, and were expected, and it was nice to be handed a Heineken as we arrived. The Good Doctor made his way down to the dock, large beer stein in hand, and led me back upstairs to the picnic table outside. ""Let me get my kit"" he, said, ""I might have some anesthetic."" I was delighted!  The doc returned, opened a plastic tackle box, revealing a couple of band aids, and a set of forceps. I was crestfallen.... He then proceeded to yard on the hook, saying, ""I hear there's a trick to this"", but after a few tries, he pulled it out, and left my finger entact. It didn't feel great, but was better than a road trip to the hospital. We thanked our hosts, after some small talk, and left.  Another occasion was a brutal self-removal at the gas dock of the Moon River Marina. I noticed a lure had become stuck in my rain jacket, and in the process of working it out, I jabbed the thing, again, past the barb. I knew the only thing worse than putting up with horsing it out myself, would be to walk into the marina and face the ridicule of the staff, who I know well, so again, I simply refused to let me problems fester, and hauled it out on my own. I haven't stuck myself for a few years: hopefully, I'm not due."

What exactly Happened:  I just landed a Salmon while I shore fished that day, then went to my car to grab a garbage bag to keep my catch. There was another angler who fished beside me complained that evening that other non anglers behind us have blasted their car sound system and talked so loud. The angler was bothered and irritated the whole time we were fishing, he dropped his 12' rod all the way back behind him during his cast, wanted to ensure those bystanders were far enough to not come any closer.  Just less than 10 minutes, by that time I came back, Ambulance and police arrived to question the incident. I found out that couple of the Bystanders came to look at my salmon that was on the ground while I was away, that was when the angler fishing beside my spot accidentally hooked one guy. The angler called the cop in since he was concern that he might get beaten up by the group of guys. We all left the area after what had happened!  ANOTHER FUNNY STORY: My non-coordinated accountant was never allowed to fish again after he hooked his wife's arm with a crankbait during casting! Can't blame him!"
700483,jimmer,2012-05-28 17:36:00,2730,"When I was around 14 years old, I hooked myself in the head with a mepps. My father tried pulling it out with a pair of pliers, which didn't go over well and ended up at the hospital to have it removed. Was up at the French River Delta a few years back. I was bent over the boat ready to net a pike that buddy had loaded up and the spoon released from the fish right into my wrist (two hooks). That was very close to a large vein, so I proceded to take a disposable shaver apart after trying a knife. Then cut a hole so the point could be punched through on one and cut down to the barb on the other. I didn't realize how tough our skin really is and how low of a pain thresh hold I have when cutting slowly. LOL Years ago I was casting for muskie with suicks, my brother was at the other end of the boat when I hit him in the head with the lure. No need to remove hooks as they came out with the follow through, just left a nice gash and I got his hat. LOL A buddy was fiddling around with a LM Bass he had caught on a J12 rapala and in my mind I was thinking he's going to get it with the way he was handling the fish, then low and behold the fish flipped and stuck him in the joint of his thumb. I was able to get the treble off of the lure, had him hold the eye down tight and I wrapped with braided, told him I was counting to three and pulled on two. That hook came right out, but the yelp was hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing. Also almost got it when leaning over the side of the boat to grab a muskie. That little bugger decided to jump and I threw my arm up to protect my face. Finally got the fish in and released it when I realized that there were three punctures on the length of my forearm. That one still gives me those ""whatiffs"". I'm actually amazed at how few times I experienced something like this for the amount of fishing I do."

Spiel and Crappiesteve yanked them out and cleaned me up in no time.  Second time I tried to flip a pike into the boat as we forgot the net.  Just as it was over the boat it flipped off the homemade 5 odd bucktail I made and the line swung around and embedded itself into my upper arm so deep I could not move it or the tendons and nerves killed. Kevin at Lakair cut the hook.  Misfish's wife Betty drove me to emerg and they gave me a local, made another incision and pushed the barb through and pulled it out.

At that age I had no clue as to what I was doing (not really any better today, lol). Somehow, my line never even hit the water. After hours and hours, I had this burning sensation in my armpit, and I kept fiddling with it. My Dad asks to take a look, and the hook was imbedded into my armpit???? I don't recall how he got it out? and I probably don't want to know .  Around age 22, me and two friends found ourselves stranded way up in the north arm of Rainy Lake. During a shorefish my buddy mishandled a decent size pike and it shook off, the treble hook went in deep into the web of his thumb. No other choice but to ""punch"" it through. After a few shots of the hard stuff, I nodded to my other buddy, and I punched him in the opposite arm. While he was distracted my other friend pulled the hook through. We cut the barb off and it slid out easily. He still tells of his warrior tale today, lol.  Thats it for me thank goodness. But I will say my glasses have been hit by others casting in the boat, numerous times. I always, always have my glasses on.

On thursday I had my second experience when I took a co-worker out pike fishing and he hooked his finger in one side and out the other.  That made it easy as the bard was already out and exposed.  We snipped the hook and pulled it out.  After a dose of hydrogen peroxide, he wanted to keep fishing."

I tried to remove it but it was buried too deep so I just cut the shank and headed back to shore then into the local clinic in Lakefield.  As I walked in I was met by a doctor who looked at my finger and took me into his office to extract it. He said it was my lucky day as this was his 1st day in his new practice and I was his 1st ever patient.  He said  seeing as it was only a bass hook he'd just yank it out and I wouldn't need any freezing.  I told him if he ever expected to meet the  2nd patient of his career he'd better freeze my finger and freeze it good  We both had a good laff and he froze it and removed it.

He was hoping to land something BIG... well....  With about his 5th cast with that big Pink thing, I hear this loud, snap, slap, yelp and then some ""choice"" words... I look back to see my massive 6'6"" buddy with this huge pink frog hanging from the side of his cheek/ear!  At first, I thought it was ""stuck"" to him because of the moisture on it, combined with the humid day. After about three seconds, I can see that the huge hook, has indeed gone straight through his ear!  At that time, he also didnt realize that it was actually THROUGH his ear, and he's yanking on it trying to ""peel"" it from his cheek as he also thought it was just stuck to him. I then proceeded to tell him that it is through his ear with the barb on the other side! He then asked ""like, ALL the way through?"" I said.. ""yup, like a 7"" PINK earring!"" LOL  I reached down for the camera to capture this moment on film, but as I was about to line up the shot... my (much larger than me) buddy said (in a serious voice) ""put the camera down..."" to which I gladly agreed!  Well, the buddy who made the ""cast"", decides that he'll just take a pair of pliers and cut off the end of the hook below the barb, and we'll just slide the hook back out........... WRONG!!! As he tried to cut the (thick) hook with the pliers... they slipped and almost ripped my other buddies ear off!  Let's just say that I'm glad we were on crown land with no one else around because people may have been offended by the vocabulary coming from our boat!  Once we got him calmed down a bit... we decide to pinch the barb and try and push the hook back through. Well, after a couple tries, it worked! After a quick dose of rubbing alcohol to clean up the ""wound"", and a few band-aid's... we were back on the hunt for some toothy monsters!  Words can't explain turning around and seeing your massive 6'6"" buddy with a huge PINK frog hanging from his ear, and my other buddy standing there in shock, not knowing to ""dump or get off the pot""!"
