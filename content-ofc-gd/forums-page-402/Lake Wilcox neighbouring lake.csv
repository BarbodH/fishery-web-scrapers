700605,Christopheraaron,2012-05-28 23:34:00,3525,"On google maps it shows a small lake next to lake wilcox in richmond hill? It looks like there might be a way to get in on the south side, is this public or private?"
700636,Rizzo,2012-05-29 00:44:00,4754,"could it be Bond Lake? Been years since I was there, at that time access was private but we had permission"
700643,davis,2012-05-29 01:03:00,128,"that'd be Bond Lake. Technically its off limits, but that doesn't seem to stop people these days. You'll see it on the East side of Yonge street when you're going north into OakRidges"
700650,Christopheraaron,2012-05-29 01:15:00,3525,"NOT BOND! I know where that is and that it is off limits, look on google maps and you'll see a small almost pond lake just a couple of blocks south of the lake."
700656,redpearl99,2012-05-29 01:25:00,259,that is a fishing conservation zone.  I use to hope the fence with my friends when I was a kid many yrs back to go fishing there but then stopped after the MNR officer found us one sunny day.  I was great fishing though.  A pike every couple casts if I can remember
700726,Christopheraaron,2012-05-29 12:12:00,3525,"Welcome redpearl, thanks for that info, it looked just too good to be true, you don't find ponds like that very often."
700748,Snidley,2012-05-29 13:04:00,620,Wilcox used to be one of my favorite lakes for great Pike and huge largemouth. I would launch my Hobbie kickboat at the rowing area and park across the street. Then the aerators broke and it became a swamp. Have they replaced the aerators yet?
700888,Christopheraaron,2012-05-29 17:09:00,3525,"Don't know but there are some carp anglers taking notice of the lake now, so probably not"
701107,redpearl99,2012-05-30 05:04:00,259,"yep there's lots of carp in Wilcox.  You can see nice 20lbs feeding by the public dock in the morning.  I've also gone there quite a bit for pike and bass, though last year was just terrible.  Thinking of going there for some pan fish soon"
701125,Christopheraaron,2012-05-30 11:15:00,3525,"I fished it early this year on some pretty ugly days before pike closed, notta, I think it's probably fished better from a boat or just in the summer."
701204,davis,2012-05-30 15:31:00,128,"oh, you mean the pond/swamp that's showing surrounded by a few streets (sandbanks, bayview park ln, etc...)? my buddy built a house there on park crescent that backed onto that area - he sold it 5 years ago but from what i can remember it didn't look like a promising spot. more like a swamp then a pond, but I could be wrong..."
701229,Christopheraaron,2012-05-30 17:01:00,3525,"Looks very nice, and deep from maps."
701265,cityfisher,2012-05-30 18:38:00,959,i used to live 2 mins from wilcox and bond...only went a couple times and caight some hammer handles... it gets very swampy during the summer time
701333,Acountdeleted,2012-05-30 22:58:00,2562,"Wilcox should improve over the next few years with all the habitat restoration the Toronto Conservation authority has completed. Lots of very young small bass in there. I hear rumors of walleye from the locals but have never seen any, Same with pike close to a meter. I'd love to fish in there but I'm pretty sure all the land is private surrounding it."
701336,Christopheraaron,2012-05-30 23:07:00,3525,"Not stall private, but I wouldn't be surprised if it did, there are 3 parks on the shoreline, mind you all are very small and you can only fish at one of them, you can take a boat out with a trolling motor from sunset beach park there are no rentals."
701345,redpearl99,2012-05-30 23:43:00,259,"the best spot I've found is on the north east edge, caught many pike and bass there"
701631,Christopheraaron,2012-05-31 20:51:00,3525,"Are you fishing from the canoe club? They don't really allow fishing from there, although everyone does."
701638,redpearl99,2012-05-31 21:08:00,259,I fish from a boat
701639,Christopheraaron,2012-05-31 21:09:00,3525,"Gottcha, might just have to try from the canoe next week!"
