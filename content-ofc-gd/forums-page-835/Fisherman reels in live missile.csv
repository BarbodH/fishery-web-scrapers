350366,splashhopper,2009-06-09 22:21:00,2931,"MADEIRA BEACH, Fla. — Authorities in Florida say a commercial fisherman reeled in a live missile in the Gulf of Mexico and kept it on his boat for 10 days.  The sheriff’s office in Pinellas County says the boat’s captain, Rodney Salomon, hooked the air-to-air guided missile 80 kilometres off the Panhandle town of Panama City.  The U.S. air force and navy use Gulf waters off the Panhandle for weapons training.  Salomon had the missile aboard his boat for 10 days before returning Monday to port in Madeira Beach, near St. Petersburg.  A bomb squad was called in from MacDill Air Force Base and dismantled the missile in an empty parking lot.   The bomb squad said the missile was very corroded from floating in salt water for a long time. They said it was live and in a very unstable state."

350888,dave524,2009-06-11 00:00:00,4508,I understand that the Dunnville Airport was a WWII training facility and that the marsh was used for bombing practice with the possibility of a few pieces of unexploded ordanace existing buried there.
350896,Rich,2009-06-11 00:41:00,3927,Dunnville? You sure that wasn't a nuclear test site?
