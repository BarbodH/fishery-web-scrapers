350958,rob v,2009-06-11 02:46:00,535,"I'm trying to figure out how to go about mounting a downrigger or two on my crestliner.   The gunnel on my boat is 3 inches wide and the mounting base/plates on my big john downriggers is 4"" square.    I would like to mount them on the gunnel some how but I can't decide how.   I was  thinking of mounting the base plate to the gunnel with the extra 1"" hanging over the inside edge of the gunnel with a 1"" peice of aluminium angle under the extra edge and attached to the side of the gunnel.  Not really excited about mounting a board across the stern. I looked into the Bert's mounting system - but the base plate for that system is 3 1/2 "" wide - which would leave an extra 1/4"" over each side if I centred it on the gunnel.  I may have to consider that option.  Anybody have any other ideas/suggestions ?  Thanks."

351022,rob v,2009-06-11 12:24:00,535,"Thanks for the suggestion Sonny - similar to the Bert's system - again the track is 3 1/2"" wide and my gunnel is only 3"" wide."
351035,John,2009-06-11 13:46:00,2956," Rob, how about this T-Bolt mounting bracket. It allows you to mount a track above the gunnel. You can then take the 'riggers off and mount rod holders or other stuff on the track.  http://www.traxstech.com/store/t_bolt_mounting.htm"
351075,bdox,2009-06-11 15:44:00,329," I might be wrong, but that looks like it's for boats that have a factory track system already installed."
351102,Dara,2009-06-11 17:15:00,3052,"Lets see your boat.  I just did mine. I used the holes already there from the cleats. Bent a piece of stainless steel at work, used a file and sander to get rid of the sharp edges and give it a brushed finnish.    I couldn't and didn't want to put a board across because there is a seat mount in the way.  If you show a picture maybe we can come up with something"
351108,Bob Devine,2009-06-11 17:31:00,251,"Rob, I have 2-6"" tracks for my boat. They don't have to go on the gunnels as you see by my pics. I have also seen people put them just in front of where I mounted mine on the carpet. All you need is a 4""x6"" area to work with when using Berts track system.  "
351110,rob v,2009-06-11 17:37:00,535,Dara/Bob - some good info - thanks.
351112,tipupesox,2009-06-11 17:40:00,167,Another option would be to install 2 flush mount rod holders and than purchase 2 gimbal mount brackets like these:  http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...rset=ISO-8859-1  Tom
351118,Fang,2009-06-11 18:07:00,1330,"Rob  I run a Crestliner 1750 with I think the same gunnels. I have 6"" wide Aluminum brackets (1/8"" thick) very similar to Dara post. They bolt in to the gunnel and then tie into back deck.  I'll post a couple of pics later. I run cannon mag 10's  with the old cannon swivel bases and the plates are very solid."
351139,Spiel,2009-06-11 19:12:00,9065,Walker Downriggers also offer a gimble mount style bracket (Quick Mount Base) for built in rod holders.  They also have a Narrow Base Angle Stand available. (2-1/2 X 6)  While I don't have them they are a nice option that allows for quick and easy removal of the downriggers when not needed and leaves a couple of rod holders behind.
