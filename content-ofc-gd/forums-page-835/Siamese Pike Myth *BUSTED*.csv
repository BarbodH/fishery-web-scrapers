350531,mikeh,2009-06-10 03:12:00,824,"no comment on the sweatshirt....but you guys sure have some good fishing in your area,thanks for sharing."
349389,Fishing 24/7,2009-06-07 22:26:00,709,OK for years me and paul have been telling people.  This is a MyTH DUMB DUMBS!  This is the original Siamese pike that went WORLD WIDE.    EVERY site says its a true 2 bodied pike....  Or is it realy.   take 2 pike.    Shove small pike into larger pikes GILL.  BADABING BADABOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      IV CAUGHT A FREAK OF NATURE! :x  :shock:  Incredible what people will believe!  Now the story behind how these pike were caught!  We start the day @ 8 am.  Dead calm water.....  Pike are still on shore and in the salad bars.(in lakes)  cast out the Famous S-B.  Set the hook hard cause the fish were bitting LIGHT.  just sticking there nose in the spinner baits buisness.!  GO EM!      Release the Gator.     Cast once Cast twice.  Hit the shore .  This one is 1.2 inches from shore.    just got a action shot of this one he jumped and Gator spin then BYE BYE SIR OLD GATOR!  Buzzbait isnt always the lure of choice this time of the year  but in small lakes were the water is hotter.  They will give you the ride of you life.  I cast the B-BAIT. in lilly pads and this one was ready to hit.!      Black B-B #1 on my list.  Then its my GOOD OL' PALS turn.  FISH ON!    a nice rocket! 8)    Fished from 8 till 11  then went for some good old poutine!  then from 1 to 2 pm and called it a day.  this is a verry small lake so 5-6 full rounds and most of the fish are spooked or nailed you lure.  kept two 4-5 lbs pike for super!    SOOOO the next time someone shows you this pictures and says ITS REAL ITS REAL.  show him this report .  just the proper way to SHUT HIM UP!
349410,Sandbag,2009-06-07 23:14:00,533,Go Team FILA  Cheers  Craig
349419,Rizzo,2009-06-07 23:44:00,4754,"sorry to burst your bubble but I'm pretty sure that ""myth"" was disproved a LONG time ago...actually I would have thought it hard to even find someone (at least any fisherperson) who still (or ever) believed it"
349421,Fishing 24/7,2009-06-07 23:59:00,709,Oh yeah thanks for the correction.  sadly it was republished in a fishing mag i read and im getting sick of seeing this picture.  what a stupid myth.
349466,msp,2009-06-08 01:42:00,1336,Winds from the North............do not go forth.    nice pike report!!! Thanks
349479,lookinforwalleye,2009-06-08 02:04:00,4399,some folk have way too much time on their hands!!
349487,splashhopper,2009-06-08 02:31:00,2931,nice fish....  maybe botbot and I should invite you two along to show us how to fish for them too  ...lol
349496,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-08 02:55:00,0,the best thing about this myth was that i got it in emails where it was supposedly caught in totally different geographical areas...as if the myth wasn't bad enough on it's own.
349927,Fishing 24/7,2009-06-09 00:14:00,709,  i cant believe this Myth is still traveling on the emails.   too much time on my hands.  i think not sir took me 2 seconds to do this.  the first guy that did this is a famous looser.  how can you lie about a stupid thing like that.  anyways.  thanx for the great replies guys!
349957,bucktail,2009-06-09 01:01:00,1857,Thank you!!!!!!!!
350096,Fishnwire,2009-06-09 12:28:00,983,"It's not really any of my business...but is there some reason why you and your chum appear to be wearing the same shirt?  Secondly, the first photo...the one we all got in our E-mail (while obviously fake) looks a lot more convincing than the one you took.  I'm not saying one is genuine and one is not, but the photos you staged look like two pike with their heads touching and not some sort of one-headed/two-bodied mutant.  IMO."

350277,EC1,2009-06-09 18:28:00,930,"nice pike report! the picture would look better if the pike under the gill plat were turned slightly more to the same profile as the first pike. Either way, thanks for proving it !"

Pm Daplumma or Aplumma, I think I heard one ogf them say they always wear a Lobster Bib when they know they're gonna blow a Seal... maybe they can tell you a cheap place to buy them... I think Aplumma buys them by the gross..."
