350912,laszlo,2009-06-11 01:20:00,487,first off...16 MORE DAYS UNTIL BASS SEASON!!!  now to the point. just wondering if anyone knows if large mouth and small mouth spawn at the same time. i'm personally not sure but do know that small mouth like cooler waters.  if the small mouth do spawn earlier then should there be a different start date to the season???  thoughts please...
350915,Gerritt,2009-06-11 01:24:00,6129,and I hear the can of worms being opened....  Small mouth are pulled off their nests AFTER the season has opened in ALOT of cases on ALOT of lakes.......  I wont add any more fuel to the upcoming fire I foresee coming..  G.

In response to this, is an early Catch and Release only season has been introduced on some larger lakes...like Champlain etc.  In warmer areas, of the USA. Bass spawn over as much as 5 or 6 months!  Here in Ontario, Bass are doing very well, you don't have to worry about them. If you want to do your part to insure the future of fishing learn CPR! Catch, Photograph, and Release."

351038,charlesn,2009-06-11 14:02:00,551,"laszlo, from what I have seen, smallmouth do prefer cooler temperatures in general than largemouth.  They probably can spawn in cooler water too as I've seen beds in 24' of water on Lake Erie for example.  Largemouth on the other hand generally spawn in the shallow muck and the shallow muck (perhaps because it's a darker bottom) seems to warm up quicker, so even though the largemouth might need warmer temperatures to spawn (I think they are pretty close as I've seen a largemouth on a bed 10 feet from a smallmouth on a bed this spring), the type of spawning habitat dictates that the largemouth are done with their spawn first.  I'm no biologist or rocket scientist, just my observations over the years that it seems like the largies are always done their thing well before opener and the smallies are done their thing closer to opener and sometimes on in to the season on deeper cooler lakes.  Also, I think light penetration, moon phase and hours of sunlight have a big impact on the spawn cycle as well, so it's not like as soon as the water hits X degrees the fish are suddenly all doing the nasty or that they will necessarily start dropping eggs in April if the there is super mild weather for a while.  I've also seen ""confused"" fish doing a false spawn well in to August.  I don't know if this answers your question or confuses you further."
