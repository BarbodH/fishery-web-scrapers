Not looking for anyone to give up a honey hole but just looking for any info on free boat ramps and some general feedback on the lake.  any info is appreciated. thanks and tight lines."
351068,DMASSE,2009-06-11 15:33:00,420,"There is a free boat ramp in Fenlon Falls  by the swing bridge.     I think there is one in Rosedale as well.   If you fish cameron  fish closer to rosedale area,  there is a area called the five fingers  (most northern) part of cameron,   GREAT musky fishing....   Also look for the deepest channel on a map,  Closest to  Fenlon and it also great for PICS   Dave"
