350106,Greencoachdog,2009-06-09 12:48:00,8163,"If you were Walleye fishing and caught Smallies... wouldn't that make those Smalleyes???  Some good lookin' fish there!!!  The self timer is a breeze once you get used to it, you may have better luck setting your camera on a boat seat to take the self timer pics though.... i've just never had a good feeling about putting a tripod in a boat."
