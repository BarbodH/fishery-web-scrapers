350676,John,2009-06-10 13:53:00,2956, Had him worried though!  I think that these reel designers and manufacturers discriminate against us left crankers...  Imagine Easton telling us that they are not going to make lefty sticks any more..
350719,JohnF,2009-06-10 15:32:00,3494, Easton could hardly refuse the hockey jocks after making left handed bats for the ball players all those years.  JF

350723,Squid,2009-06-10 15:45:00,1656,Well I have a pete mania musky reel that I bought off of Lew who bought it for his daughter Sherri. She used it twice and wanted a lLH retrieve. I used it 3 times last summer as I have a shimano calcutta that I use 98 % of the time. So here is the problem. The reel will not wind the line because the part that moves across and feeds the line in to the reel broke. This reel has maybe 10 hrs on it. What do I do with it?
350724,Raf,2009-06-10 15:47:00,3495,"chalk it up to experience, toss it and remember to buy quantum, abu, shimano or another established brand next time pete.  aikmans might be able to fix it for you but not sure if he'd have the right parts. cant hurt to ask."
350732,Roy,2009-06-10 16:10:00,13728, Sue Lew maybe?
350763,Fishn Technishn,2009-06-10 18:37:00,198,Send it to ME!! I usually only get left crank reels now but about the only right crank one I WILL use is my Maina reel. Can always use it for a spare or parts. How much? FT
347953,mistaredone,2009-06-03 19:50:00,913,BP is out of stock on maina reels days befor the musky opener. I'm hearing two weeks for re-stock. Anyone here work for bp?  Anyone able to contact Pete?  If that was my company i would want to know and would be pissed.  What a time to run out of stock. Anyone have a cheap set up suggestion?  I'm looking for another combo for myself and my buddy. 7-8 foot MH
347960,steverowbotham,2009-06-03 20:03:00,1800,"I work for BPS but there's really nothing we can do about it.  Our distribution centre in Springfield, MO decides what we get and when we get it.  It's a busy time of year right now, doing the best we can."
347970,Roy,2009-06-03 20:27:00,13728,I'll talk to Pete...I'm sure he can fix you up. Quickly too!
347971,mistaredone,2009-06-03 20:30:00,913,I'm a produce manager and i understand distro problems but when I can't get Christmas trees in December I call a lumber jack. Sometimes it helps going to the source to get problems fixed.
347972,Roy,2009-06-03 20:34:00,13728, You got that one right too!
347973,Weekend Warrior,2009-06-03 20:35:00,27,"I was there the other day and they had the Maina reels in a combo...there were 5 or so there. I think the combo was $150.  My buddy mentioned that he bought one and it was junk - I don't have a recommendation of another reel of comparable price, but if I were in the market I would be considering other options even if BPS had the reel in stock."
347976,Bitsmith2k,2009-06-03 20:41:00,396," really? i picked up a low profile one last year, and its easily my favourite baitcaster... never had a problem with it.."
347981,Weekend Warrior,2009-06-03 20:53:00,27,"  I guess that's why it helps to get lots of different opinions  Looking at the reviews, it seems more people like it than not, so you aren't alone in your endorsement.  BPS online says it is on clearance. Are you sure they are getting more in?  Link"
347994,perchslayer666,2009-06-03 21:45:00,280,"I have one of these reel (low profile) it is awsome, durable and holds a good amount of line, got it on sale for $79 last year"
348006,mikeh,2009-06-03 22:13:00,824,"If Roy can't help you with the Pete Maina reel . I'd recommend the new Curado 300 series, it's on sale at bass pro for $199. If you want a light rod look at the Fig rods at JB's."
348020,SBCregal,2009-06-03 22:55:00,688,"I was told there is a redesigned model coming out, or something like that when I went up and bought mine a month or 2 ago.  When I was there they were out of the high ratio reel so I ended up buying the 4.2:1 ratio reel.  ryan"
348032,Pete Maina,2009-06-03 23:30:00,213,"Hi All,  Hope OFNER's doing well out there ... and catching fish, and getting ready for the seasons ... muskies upcoming pretty soon.  My buddy Roy alerted me to this issue here (thanks, oh tall one   ). Seriously, appreciate you letting me know on this friend.  So here's the deal: The current round reels are being discontinued. I found out in early April at a trip to corporate ... it's really about me being a bit persnickity about what my name is on ... the round reels have been tremendous - and still are really, but last year there was a bit of an uptick in complaints and problems, as compared to near none, previously. I reported some of the stuff to corporate, and asked them to look into it. Apparently tooling just getting old and tolerances poorer, were the findings - And, the source not willing to retool; so rather than let things get to the point of lots of troubles, it's cancelled and looking for new round reel (or something more large line capacity) source. There's likely some left in some places, and I'd say grab 'em where you can find 'em ('cuz honestly still think best quality reel out there for the price - no doubt), but for now gonna be low-profile only until we get something I & Bass Pro are comfortable with.  As I see a couple have mentioned here, the low profile reel actually does everything needed for muskie/pike angling. With today's lines, it holds plenty for casting. I mainly use the 80lb. Spiderwire Ultracast and can get plenty on.  Sorry about this, and no real ""notice"" ... but when left with a choice of having reels that would consistently see more negative quality issues that I'd be using (and with my name on it) - that wasn't an exciting option. Too bad they wouldn't retool; great reels.  Hope this answers the questions, and hope we are able to find a suitable replacement for larger line capacity reel. In the meantime, I expect folks would be happy with the low profile as an option.  Best Fishes!  Pete"
348042,leighfns,2009-06-03 23:50:00,103,I have a used one that I can part with as I just got a daiwa luna .  I live in Belleville though...  I will be out on Stoco for opener let me know if you are interested...
348131,mistaredone,2009-06-04 02:59:00,913,"Thanks for taking the time Pete!  Glad to hear your taking action and have pride in your product.  The low profile reels are also out of stock at BP.  I ended up taking my buddy to JB'S and outfitted him with a C3 6500 on a StCroix for more $$$  I'm gonna hold out for the Maina low profile combo, hope its in stock soon $199 is a great price.  I'll stop in BP on the way up north friday.  Love the show!  Keep the big girls coming!  Thanks for the help Roy.  Steve"
348195,Pete Maina,2009-06-04 11:50:00,213,Thanks Steve and Roy.  Hopefully they can get some of those low profiles in soon  Pete
348202,Roy,2009-06-04 11:57:00,13728,I have two of the round ones and they've been really good....still are. I haven't got a low profile model but I tried one of Marc Thorpe's last season and  I was surprised at what it can handle....for the size I mean.  I'm glad you stepped in so quickly Pete.....that's a real good thing . Thank you
348349,bigbuck,2009-06-04 17:38:00,2449,"Hey Pete!! What's shakin'?? Anyways, Pete's rods and reels are fantastic for the money that you spend on them. They really are the greatest bang for the buck. For the price of a Calcutta TE, you can get 2 full outfits (rods/reels) + line and a few bucks to spare on a couple of lures. The low profile reel is sweet and I'll be adding one to the arsenal at some point but after picking up a trailer and a boat, it ain't happenin' anytime too soon. Pete if you want to fish Georgian Bay, drop me a line.  Bruce"
348404,kickingfrog,2009-06-04 20:41:00,8333,"  ""surprised at what it can handle... for the size I mean.""  I was thinking the same thing about you Roy.   I have a Calcutta TE and Curado D 300 that I love, but I think I'll give the Maina stuff a look see the next time I'm in a store."
348436,JohnF,2009-06-04 21:31:00,3494,Sad that they haven't realized there are left handed crankers out here too.  JF
348653,Pete Maina,2009-06-05 14:20:00,213,"Hey guys,  Thanks again Roy, appreciate you letting me know on this. Thanks Bruce ... and thanks for the invite man.  I hear John ... apparently they don't think there are enuf of you lefties (when I ask about that - they say really don't sell enuf) ... how many are you willing to buy  Pete"
348661,John,2009-06-05 14:38:00,2956,Thanks for the feedback Pete. I'm like John F I haven't learned to crank with my right hand yet....... . But I do like the reel.
348723,JohnF,2009-06-05 18:45:00,3494," Only one, but us Canuckians have always led the way in leftiness. Apparently it's cuz we all grew up playing hockey. Most of us are naturally right handed but hockey, baseball and fishing seem to bring out lefty genes.  JF"
348728,kickingfrog,2009-06-05 18:59:00,8333,"Reeling with your left hand and holding the rod with you right does not make you left-handed. It means you're right handed. Sort of like catching a baseball with your left hand making someone lefthanded.  I don't know why or how baitcast reels used to be only available in a right-hand reel option, but it is one of the few things that benefited me (besides most things in sports) as a lefty."
350566,Roy,2009-06-10 04:27:00,13728,"For those of you looking for a Pete Maina round reel, I think I've found a supplier. These people are well known in our community and are also advertisers with us. Give them and the Maina reel a try. You won't regret it. Click HERE"
