350829,Tybo,2009-06-10 21:20:00,1373,"So it came down to this. You had to get a guide. TISK, TISK!!  Nice fish though."
350995,limeyangler,2009-06-11 09:41:00,5204,you mean you all kept your limit!!!?....ok ....ok...i am joking....lol...JOKING!!!!  great stuff Mike....guess team 3 gets some more inches....WTG
351036,fishhunter,2009-06-11 13:54:00,604,TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS 1ST FISHING FOR ANY FISH IN THE SUMMER IS HARD ON A FISH. WITH THE WATER BEING SO WARM IT MAKES IT HARD TO RELEASE IF YOU HAVE A LONG FIGHT. I HAVE FOUND IF YOU GET THE BOWS IN THE UPPER WATER 40 AND UP AND DONT USE A NET JUST USE PLIERS IN THE WATER YOU HAVE A GOOD SHOT AT THEM LIVING TO BITE ANOTHER DAY. 2ND WHEN YOU FISH LAKE O YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU WILL CATCH I SET A PATTERN THAT WORKS FOR SALMON AND BOWS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. SOME OF MY BEST SALMON DAYS HAVE BEEN IN THE BLUE WATER SO IN THE END ITS SET THE RODS AND SEE WHAT BITES. KEEP YOUR FIGHTS SHORT AND KEEP THE LINES SHALLOW IF YOU WANT TO LET A FISH GO.
351051,Headhunter,2009-06-11 15:02:00,5703,"Thanks for that Lloyd! BTW -  YOU DON""T HAVE TO YELL! LMAO HH"
349499,bassmastermike,2009-06-08 03:03:00,295,"Well i dont know where to begin, First of all i would like to say WOW!! this being my first charter on the big water of lake O i will never forget this experiance. Woke up bright and early Saturday morning to meet Lloyd at the boat, when i arrived i met two other guys from the board AILE GOBY and NANCUR373 and his father down from down east for a visit. After a brief introduction we all loaded on the boat with our Tim Horton's and we were off a little ahead of schedual 4:50 am...  So we all sat down and Lloyd put the throttle to the floor and we were on our way to an undisclosed detinationLOL and along the way we got to enjoy a breathtaking sunrise...       Then at last we arrived and Lloyd turned on FRED the autopilot and got to work right away getting everything set up for us.. WOW this guy works hard. After everything was set up we all threw a couple bucks overboard for the fishing Gods!   The Gods must of really liked our donation because at 5:26 the first rod went off and i was up first... What a beauty Rainbow    Next up it was NANCUR373's father WTG pops!!!    NANCUR373's turn!!    AILE Your up!!!!    Double Header!!!!    Group Photo   What an amazing day of fishing and conversation and i learned a whole bunch too!! If you wanna catch fish Lloyd knows how to put u on fish! this will be one of my most  (EPIC) fishing adventures yet. Thanks to my new fellow fishermen and to the Captain of the pirate ship Cheers to you all. We managed to land 20 fish in the boat by 11 am now thats what i call an amazing day... Here are a few pictures of my wonderful ending to the story DINNER yum yum   "
349504,e-z-out,2009-06-08 03:27:00,1052,Saturday was a blast it was nice to meet you Mike hope to get out for some bass with you some time.  I might get out this saturday or sunday with Lloyd depends on when my son is born. For anyone heading out with Lloyd you're going to have a blast.  Thanks again Lloyd for a great time on Lake O
349511,BillM,2009-06-08 03:39:00,17367,"Nice bows, how many of them made it into the box?"
349512,bassmastermike,2009-06-08 03:43:00,295,We all kept the limit!!
349519,BillM,2009-06-08 03:55:00,17367,  I hope for the bow population everyone in that pic had conservation licenses
349522,Sinker,2009-06-08 04:01:00,8692," Actually, its none of your business how many fish they kept. They are all within thier legal right to keep a limit. Why not just say thanks for the report, and keep your opinion to yourself??  Good fishin fella's. Lloyd knows his stuff for sure. I've never fished with him before, but I've talked to him several times at the launches around here, and he's always been willing to share valuable info with me.  Sinker"
349524,siwash,2009-06-08 04:18:00,683, I AGREE! Good going...  P.S. more than 50% of Lake O's bow pop is stocked (i.e. put-and-take)
349526,BillM,2009-06-08 04:24:00,17367," I guess you missed the little smiley face at the end of my post, lol  Relax kid."
349529,Sinker,2009-06-08 04:55:00,8692," No, actually I didn't. All I missed was the part where you said thanks for the report, or good going, or congrats..........anything positive would have been nice. It was afterall a great report.  And who you callin' kid?"
349531,nancur373,2009-06-08 05:27:00,1211,Ok guys. Calm down. What a great day on the water. Me and my Dad's first time on lake O (well his first time to Ontario period). What a blast! Rarely a dull moment. Not much 'dead air'. BIG THANKS to Lloyd of U and Me Guide Service. Man he knows where they are. Nice meeting you Mike. Hope to see you again.
349548,solopaddler,2009-06-08 11:00:00,8605,"Right on Mike, glad to see you boys had a good trip!"
349551,smokin joe,2009-06-08 11:19:00,226,Congrats guys! Thanks for the great report and pics
349555,fishhunter,2009-06-08 11:34:00,604,Just so you all know 9 kept others all let go at the boat and never netted or touched.Pliers are always used in the water to let fish go so not harmed. Like always was a blast spending time with OFC guys.
349557,Greencoachdog,2009-06-08 11:38:00,8163,Great report and pics Mike!!!  Looks like a very fun day with some board members!!!  Ain't nothin' wrong at all with keeping your limit for a very tasty looking dinner!!!  Thanks for posting that report!
349559,medmart,2009-06-08 11:50:00,587,Great report mike you can't go wrong fishing with Lloyd and you where with good company that makes for a great day  Rob

349621,Steel28,2009-06-08 15:00:00,160,Great report!
349693,Joey,2009-06-08 17:40:00,9122,Awesome report Mike.  Looks like a great day of fishing.  Way to go on some nice bows  Joey
349776,bassmastermike,2009-06-08 19:59:00,295,Thanks for all the positive replies !! All fish in this report were enjoyed to the max!!!! Not an ounce of waste..
350431,Leecher,2009-06-10 00:21:00,7832,The fishing gods was certainly on your side.... great looking bows Thanks for sharing Leechman
350432,Whitespinnerbait,2009-06-10 00:27:00,2038,Great report and read right there ...  And now i'm hungry as hell after seeing the pics of the trout all cooked up and stuff ..  :worthy:
350672,Mike Pike,2009-06-10 13:42:00,1332,"Now, that's what a charter fishing trip is all about!  Good fishing and some good friends.  Thanks for sharing that adventure, right down to the great looking meal you prepared!!!  Cheers!"
350703,Headhunter,2009-06-10 14:48:00,5703,"Way ta go boys! You can certainly tell that you guys had a blast! Lloyd's a great guy, fun to spend time with and yah, he knows his stuff. Pass me a lemon, would ya Lloyd! Just a question for you guys and I certainly don't want to start anything... I've fished Lake O in the summer in the blue water and have found that the survival rate for those bows seems to be very low. Can the same thing be said catching them at this time of year, with the surface temp being cooler? Again, I'm just curious! Thanks again for the great report and pics! HH"
350717,LeXXington,2009-06-10 15:28:00,1928,"WTG Mike and group.  Loyd really know's his stuff and is a great guy.  Like HH just got a question, were you fishing particular for Bows or were they the ones hitting.  I have been out once this year and all I got was bows too??  Thanks"
350793,steverowbotham,2009-06-10 19:29:00,1800,cant beat that
