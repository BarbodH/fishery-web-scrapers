What I can't find is any reviews of the cottages or customer feedback and was wondering if anyone has been and stayed anywhere at the lake that could give a fair review? I see there are lots of resorts and most of the pricing is the same, but would like to hear any good or bad reviews. I'm not looking for anything overly fancy (guides, fly-outs and such) just a convienet location, clean cottages, good equipment (boats) and access to stores/town.  I plan on driving, one week stay from Toronto.  Thanks in advance  Jason"
