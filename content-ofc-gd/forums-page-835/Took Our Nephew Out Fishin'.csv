349990,Rich,2009-06-09 01:51:00,3927,"Sugarpacket and I took our nephew Isaiah out fishing this afternoon in hopes of some big carp. Unfortunately Isaiah by pure chance never had any takers good enough to set the hook into. Sugarpacket and I each got into a fish. The one time Isaiah's rod doubled over he was far too distracted by the snails he picked to play with. lol  Either way, we all had fun. Isaiah really loves to fish and didn't really mind at all not catching any.  And yes, those are flowers in our hair. LOL Kids make ya do the strangest things. The flowers were ""good luck""          "
