349520,douG,2009-06-08 03:56:00,2693,"I firmly believe that new life is a joy to all of us.  As for advice, JohnF accurately described the situation 15 or twenty years from now.  This is the time to get your hooks in, while your kid still thinks you are the man.  You want to be a part of his new experiences; read to him everyday, starting now.  Have baths together, feed him and change him.  And listen.  Congratulations to you and your wife."
349593,Uncle Buck,2009-06-08 13:46:00,1000,Congrats to you and your Family

349657,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-06-08 16:21:00,0," probably more than half!  in 2007 i spent about 70-80 days on the water... i'm guessing that's going go to go down a lot!  BUT, when he's old enough to come with me, it will more than make up for it.  Plus, I travel for work to a lot of great fishing destinations...Salmon River, Nipigon, French River etc...   Thanks for all the congrats and well wishes folks!"

349992,Pigeontroller,2009-06-09 01:53:00,2793,Congrats! Nothing in life is as amazing as seeing your first child come into this world!  Interesting name choice! A good family friend who's been gone some years now was from Denmark and his name was Kaj. I always liked it and if I were to have another Son that would be his 1st or maybe 2nd name.
350016,wuchikubo,2009-06-09 02:26:00,1114,Congrats!!!  All those early hours waking up for fishing training will come in handy for a little while  I hope all the family is doing well.  Stan
350074,Dnthmn,2009-06-09 06:25:00,128,"Congrats and tell Kai I said Happy Birthday!  He could not have picked a better day to arrive (Yes, it's my birthday too!)  Little tip, I was able to get out and do more fishing while the missus was still off on Mat leave. Just take a late night or early morning feeding, then when  his belly's full and his bum is changed, lay him back down to sleep and hit the water. By the way, diaper then bottle in that order only. Don't want to take the advice then I'm not responsible for what happens  Congrats again."

349391,JohnF,2009-06-07 22:32:00,3494,"Dunno why you say it's clearly not fishing related yet. It is most definitely fishing related, as well related to every non-work pleasure in which you indulge. At the risk of sounding condescending my son, control of your life has now been relegated to a higher power - yer wife, with a lot of influence from the little one. You will go fishing when they say you can. It's that simple. If you try to carpe diem (seize the day for those who didn't study latin) you'll find yerself in doodoo so deep you couldn't cast a 2 oz weight on 10# braid out of it if it were air. Purty good analogy for a fishing site huh?  And the best part is that unless yer a total dipstick as a father you won't even mind. We all discovered when our kids came along that we no longer were rulers of our own domain - the kids were, hands down, and we loved it.  But take comfort in the fact that before very long they'll be treating you like the hero of their world and dragging you out to fish with them, and asking you to teach them how to ride a bike, and one day, if you really do an exceptional job as a pop, he'll even ask you for advice on girls, but don't count on that one. I don't know anyone who ever made it to the top of that particular mountain. Settle for them occasionally treating you like yer a little bit cool, like when I told my youngest I knew the Wild Strawberries and was gonna introduce him to them. He was kinda like ""Dad, how come you know them?"" as if they had some kind of social disease if they were friends of mine. To this day he still acts like that was some kind of aberration on their part.  We fathers do what we can to be the centre of our kids' lives, and settle for whatever bone they throw us, cuz that's what Dads do. Enjoy the trip for the next 20 years. It takes at least that long before they realize that parents are people too.  I'm envious. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.  JF"
349429,troutologist,2009-06-08 00:22:00,951,Congrats bud! I'm quite willing to let you live vicariously through my fishing exploits.  Hope the family is all doing well.
349431,danbouck,2009-06-08 00:24:00,4380,Congrats
349433,bigugli,2009-06-08 00:27:00,6138,"Congratulations. Now begins a wonderful, and often crazy new adventure  . Enjoy and relish every minute. They grow up faster than you expect. Today he is a bundle of joy. Next thing you know he's graduating high school  ."
349455,Dara,2009-06-08 01:17:00,3052,"Congrats on the new one. And...congrats on the timing too. Nobody else mentioned it but we must always remember the timing.  No weddings or birthdays anywhere near an opening day of anything.  I almost blew it with my second. He was born 2 weeks before opening of deer season.  And don't marry a woman with a birthday near any openers either.  I see so many guys getting married on the May long weekend. It really is sad.   Anyway...congrats again and have lots of fun with him. They grow up way too fast, and its over before you know it."
349485,Sinker,2009-06-08 02:28:00,8692," How could you possibly forget the most important opener of them all?? I guess you don't fish musky????  Congrats Dr!! It is, at the very least, a life changing experience. At least you can take him musky fishing for his birthday every year  Sinker"
349488,Dara,2009-06-08 02:39:00,3052,"  Ummmm...we don't have much in the way of Muskie up here, plus...its the 3rd Sarurday in June in his area.  You can plan for a season, but not in every place in the country...sheesh"
349491,Rattletrap2,2009-06-08 02:48:00,1652,"Congrats to you both! And, a true Canadian he is.....already wearing his toque!"
