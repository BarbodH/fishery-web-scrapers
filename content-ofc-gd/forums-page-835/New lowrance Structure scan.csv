350121,mbac31,2009-06-09 13:08:00,904,I cant wait for this add on for the New HDS units. Seems to be way better than Humminbird's side imaging.  
350150,BillM,2009-06-09 14:19:00,17367,"It seems better because it's most likely a higher res.  I'm sure Humminbird has something similar coming down the pipe.  Although, those pictures are pretty awesome."
350155,ohhenrygsr,2009-06-09 14:24:00,947,Yea plus i think the lowrance unit can scan at a higher speed. It's funny how the military have been using these units for along time now.
350156,moemoe,2009-06-09 14:24:00,352,"Wow, thats impressive detailed bottom info"
350400,bucktail,2009-06-09 23:43:00,1857,"Looks awesome, I have started saving for one a few weeks ago. I do wish the side scan was in colour as it would help out with the density readings for your returns."
350413,danbouck,2009-06-09 23:58:00,4380,Can anybody guess on a price?
350425,Terry,2009-06-10 00:11:00,14456,"I think I need one  wow   they said if you build it,  they will come        wow I all most did   I wannnnnt it"
350478,Dara,2009-06-10 01:55:00,3052,  I think the military has a bit better budget than we do too
350492,BITEME,2009-06-10 02:12:00,1968,If you need it to catch fish take up golf!!!
350583,Sinker,2009-06-10 06:35:00,8692,  Thanks for beating me to it!!!!!  I have better things to blow my $ on!!!
350637,big guy,2009-06-10 12:14:00,414,"Whatever happened to reading and teaching yourself about how to do a certain thing, or talking to people who will educate you, whatever happened to learning? No, let's just buy this gadget and drive around the lake all day until we see fish on the monitor. Do we as not a society watch enough TV already? Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought getting outside, getting out on the lake was to reap the benefits of being outside and seeing what's around us. Sure we'd be outside, but we'd still be watching this little TV like devise and not appreciating everything else.  There are obviously some very smart people in the world, people who invent things like this, but by making them, it's making it easier for people who will buy them, making them lazy, thus not making them smarter. Maybe gadgets like that should be banned.  Anyway, seeing them is one thing, catching them is another I guess eh?"
