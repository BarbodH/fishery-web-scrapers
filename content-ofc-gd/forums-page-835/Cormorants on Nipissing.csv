349784,Jonny,2009-06-08 20:16:00,1380," You might not have heard of the worst of it (or the best of it).  The cormorants on Nipissing and the Great Lakes are double-crested cormorants. I read an article recently where there's concern among some locals about the disappearance of a small population of dc cormorants in Maine. Apparently, there, dc cormorants are rare, although very common elsewhere. The reason for their dwindling number? The resurgence of bald eagles! The eagles feed on their chicks. Maybe we should encourage a breeding population of bald eagles in this neck of the woods!  We do all sorts of things to alter, adjust, improve, enhance and protect the environment and its benefits to us. Stocking of lakes, anyone? How about the spraying of spruce budworm that devastate the aesthetic and commercial possibilities of forests? Or the campaign to get rid of those pesky pine bark beetle invaders that are cutting huge swaths through BC forests?  The ""hands off"" approach is not somehow the golden objective. We have our needs too, and they are not necessarily incompatible with nature as a whole. We can manage resources and we also know enough to create or maintain a balance that suits us in some small ways.  Getting rid of cormorants on Nipissing is a no-brainer. The balance that we painstakingly created between sport fishing, native fishing (which takes well over half of the catch in Nipissing), and sustainability of the resource, is in danger of being upset by proliferating cormorants. The lake was fine when there were none, it would be fine without them again, and more suited to our recreational use. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. All wildlife is not sacrosanct.  ------------------------------  EDIT - correction. The article I found some time ago mentioned dc cormorants as being rare in Maine. I searched this again, and it's great cormorants which are rare there, although common elsewhere. Bald eagles are predators of both.  http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/enviro...les_N.htm?imw=Y"
349840,JimC,2009-06-08 22:01:00,86,"Haven't posted in a long long time, but check this forum from time to time ... this topic is one I just have to weigh in on.  I grew up in North Bay, and fished with my father and uncles as a kid.  Never ever saw a Cormorant back then.  Although I long ago moved to Southern Ont.  I have a fondness for North Bay and think Lake Nipissing is a tremendous resource for the area. As such I have been returning with my wife and kids for 30 years to rent a cottage on NW Nipissing,  do a little fishing and a whole lot of relaxing. I started bringing five guys from work to the same Camp some thirteen years ago to catch a few Walleye, and relax.   We haven't missed a year, and were there again for the second week of the opener.  Now here's the kicker .. we were the ONLY ONES there in Camp!     Sure some of that could be blamed on the recession,  but even before that.  there were a lot of folks we talked to that had also been coming to Lake Nipissing for years, but were now discouraged by the obviously enormous Cormorant population and a corresponding reduction of fishing success.    The last two years six guys fishing six hours a day for six days managed to scrape together enough Walleye for ONE meal, and not a big meal,  each year.     Now before you snicker about our prowess as fishermen,   some of us definitely know how to get Walleye interested. In the early years this same group sometimes caught (and mostly released) up to 150 Walleye during our stay.  We didn't see many / any cormorants then. So what's happening?  Well we too spotted that 1000+ bird flock mentioned earlier in this thread,  plus many smaller groups.  We're talking Cache Bay area out towards the Hardwoods,  Pickerel rock, etc.      What hit us over the head was the lack of Perch.    All week we caught ONE freakin Perch.  One.     In years past we would go through a full flat of worms no problem.   This year,  maybe two dozen worms,  and some of those were due to dragging to death behind a spinner,  for hours till they drowned!  So what about the poor guy who invested in the Camp?     ... a camp that can accomodate maybe 70+ vacationers at a time, and used to regularly.   and here were the Six of us and a lot of empty cottages and idle boats.     I am sure this is happening most everywhere on the Lake and Tourism is a very important resource for the North Bay,  Calender,  Sturgeon Falls and surrounding area.    Big economic impact no doubt.     I am going to have some work to do to convince my fishing buddies to ante up and return next spring to spend our tourist dollars.  My Questions: 1.  Why do local politicians not put more pressure on the MNR to take action and allow a controlled cull?  2.  Why do the First Nations not take action NOW?    Perhaps I am wrong in assuming they would be exempt from prosecution under current laws?   My thinking is that they have the right to do whatever to sustain their food supply.   ie. Walleye.  So simply put,  as I have seen with my own eyes.    1000 Cormorant flock =  bad news for Perch / sunfish  =  bye bye Walleye and Pike.  Something really needs to be done.   A cull would help.  It's happened elsewhere (eg. Algonquin Park) ... why not Lake Nipissing .. before its too late (if it isn't already)."
349843,Billy Bob,2009-06-08 22:05:00,5865,Evidently you didn't read the link about the cormorants.  If you believe what it says that although the cormorants are always thought to be a threat to fish populations this is far from the truth.  Bob
349852,Terry,2009-06-08 22:22:00,14456,"I do disagree with the report I have read other reports that say they dive to 35 ft and have been seen eating fish up to 2lbs including bass pike and walleye and have seen pictures to back it up  your report keeps stating that fish numbers were declining before the return of the bird, so they are not responsible well maybe but having 1500 birds eating a 2lb fish each day sure isn't going to help the fish population ...."
349855,JohnF,2009-06-08 22:34:00,3494, I was told by a diver on Lake Erie that he was passed at 50' by a diving cormorant. Not sure what that means in terms of the damage they do but I found it interesting.  JF
349868,JimC,2009-06-08 22:55:00,86," well bob,  no I didn't read the 'linked' report ... but have read many reports on this subject in the past.     I really don't give a rat's ass about reports commissioned by gosh-knows-who.  But, what I believe is that DB Cormorants are primarily a coastal prevalent species ... thus the diving capability.    Lake Nip with an average depth of maybe 12ft - 15ft. just makes it an unfair fight for the Perch et al that the Lake depends on to sustain and grow the Walleye population.   and Pike as well.  The ""slot"" was brought in about 7 years ago I believe it was, to help reverse declining Walleye populations.    I didn't see large numbers (or any) Cormorants back then.  I believe the 'slot' helps,  especially now that it applies year round,  but the invasive Cormorants negate good 'spawn' years,  based on real life results.  It sucks when you want to bring your family to a special place,  sustain a long vacation tradition,  teach your kids and grand kids to fish,  and catch nada."
349879,cram,2009-06-08 23:12:00,1733," Bob, its an interesting report but they seem to measure impact on important species by how many salmonoids the cormorants eat.  What about the shallow water fish like bass, pike, etc?  What about the prey species?  What about the damage to islands/vegetation that they glaze over?"
349881,Billy Bob,2009-06-08 23:13:00,5865,"Hey guys, it not MY report it's your Canadian Government that did the report.  I tend to side with all of you. If they opened a shotgun season on these birds I have enough ammo to take out about 1000 myself.......  If you read the report and it's a LONG ONE.........it really only talks about the Great Lakes that have much larger fish populations.........I can see where in a smaller lake that they could devastate a fish population.  One thing to think about though is if there are a lot of cormorants on your lake you must have a pretty good fish population or they would just relocate to another lake that does.  Bob"
349937,laszlo,2009-06-09 00:29:00,487,i thought the fish in the lake were for the birds as well as us???
349943,JohnF,2009-06-09 00:40:00,3494, Could we train the Cormorants to love Gobies?  JF
349946,Jonny,2009-06-09 00:45:00,1380," Once they've done their part to decimate the stock, they can move on. Those of us who live on this lake or depend on it for livelihood, can't.  If a study has been done on Nipissing cormorants to see what they eat, I haven't heard about it. My gut feeling is that the ones I am seeing are feasting mainly on perch and other small fish, including some small pickerel, but whether they're going for small game or non-game classified fish, they can't help but have an impact in the numbers that there are.  To simply assume that they are a non-issue, as the MNR does, I think is a reprehensible head-in-the-sand approach. These birds have the potential to be able to undo all the conservation measures that have been taken. Why are we not hearing anything proactive from the MNR?  I did read the entire report, thanks. I maintain some considerable skepticism about the conclusions, and their applicability to this lake.  What would I like to see? A determined effort to spray the eggs of nesting cormorants (they're bloody well easy to find!), an effort lasting 3 to 5 years, only necessary during the nesting season of course. I'm not so sure about the efficacy of shooting them by means of organized culls. I don't think you could get rid of enough of them, but perhaps I'm wrong.  I know that if they start nesting on the beautiful islands near us and turning them into stinking wastelands, I'll be screaming bloody murder. I expect to have to do that any spring now."
349949,Jonny,2009-06-09 00:50:00,1380," Osprey and kingfishers and mergansers, fine. Thousands of invasive cormorants, no."

350056,cram,2009-06-09 03:57:00,1733,They are essentially an invasive species.  If they were a fish or a weed or a moth or a rat we'd be trying hard to get rid of them.
350143,Jonny,2009-06-09 14:09:00,1380,"I was using the video feature on my digital camera (Olympus 550 - 12x optical zoom) to record some ducks feeding under our bird feeder by the shore when I saw a string of cormorants winging by about a half mile out to go fishing further down the bay. I turned the camera on them.  Last night I took another look at the video on my laptop and slowed it down so I could count.  750 cormorants in that one flock, and it's early in the year!  In late August it will be more like about 1500."
350202,4thgen,2009-06-09 15:51:00,157," Good job in posting something that lays out the facts while letting people come to their own conclusions, although claiming to want to shoot them regardless really makes you sound like one of those inbred freaks that just plain gets off on killing things.  Government studies can't always be depended on for accuracy but this one seems to sum up the facts pretty well.  As for the ""every cormorant eats a two pound fish a day"" argument -- have you seen that picture of an osprey with a 30"" musky? Does that mean that every osprey is going to catch a 30"" musky every day?"
350211,Jonny,2009-06-09 16:07:00,1380," Government studies tend to have a political component, that's why we take them with a grain of salt, no matter what is being studied. And this study looks only at the Great Lakes. That is a limiting factor as well. We have no idea of what the impact is on a lake like Nipissing which has a different makeup and which already has heavy pressure on it.  I would welcome at least a study, government or not, but total inaction is not welcome."
350230,Billy Bob,2009-06-09 17:00:00,5865," Yep, that's me a inbred freak that met his wife at a family reunion...........  Young lad, stop back around when your no longer wet behind the ears........   Billy Bob The Inbred Freak"
350418,JimC,2009-06-10 00:03:00,86,"ok I have finally read the Cormorant Study via link provided by Billy Bob ... who is just the messenger here, so don't shoot him ... and besides I think he has more ammo than anyone else.  :-)  so here's the thing.   as far as I'm concerned,  the ""study""  relates to the Great Lakes which is fine in itself;  however,  it is pretty much totally irrelevant as far as LAKE NIPISSING is concerned.   Why?   well, as I mentioned in my initial comment on this subject,  Lake Nip is a very SHALLOW LAKE on average 12-15ft is my understanding.  In fact I think unusually shallow relative to its area.  Great Lakes are deeper and much larger in area.  Cormorants can dive to the bottom in most of Lake Nipissing.    Cormorants eat Perch,  lots of them.    We no longer see Perch in any quantity in Lake Nipissing,  if at all.  I truly believe that if left unchecked,  the rapidly adapting, and exploding population of the Cormorant will deal a severe, if not deadly, blow to the Lake Nipissing and District Tourism industry.  No one has commented about the First Nations taking action NOW,  to protect their vested interest for food and to also sell Walleye and Pike,  which I believe they can now do.    Maybe they are doing what they can, like egg oiling ... but a controlled cull is also going to be needed to keep the Cormorants in check, imho.  This is not just about me wanting to catch a bunch of Walleye when I want.   it is about local employment thru a vibrant tourism industry,  and controlling pollution caused by an out of control colony of these voracious, mainly sea-going birds.  Wake up folks,  before its too late.   Write the MNR,  the local Mayors,  your MPP (yeah that will help!),  the LOCAL NEWSPAPER (www.nugget.ca).    I am going to get off my a** and do just that this week.    It may not help,  but I'll feel a heck of a lot better by trying to make a difference.     ok I'm done."
350453,Sharkbait22,2009-06-10 01:11:00,297,"Don't know if there is any truth in this, but I have heard that we humans have facilitated the return of cormorants.   One theory is that we have fished-out many of the large predators in lakes across NA.  Numbers aren't what they once were.  Predators eat the smaller bait fish so in their absence the baitfish numbers went up.  Cormorants will eat small game fish (e.g., 30 cm pike) but rely more on smaller prey. Oddly enough, I have notice a lot more perch in Nip over the last 5-6 years. It's all we catch ice fishing! I real pain.   Does anyone have an idea when cormorants became numerous?  What other factors could explain low numbers of walleye.  I didn't read the EC report.  Perhaps I will. I love Nipissing and don't care for the bird. Pelicans are next.  Cheers."

349347,Jonny,2009-06-07 20:58:00,1380,"Where we live, on the shore of the Great North Bay, Lake Nipissing, we are regularly treated to a sight we would rather do without. Every summer there are numerous days when we see cormorants winging in from the south side of the lake. When whatever triggers them to come fishing up here on the north side, you can watch them with a pair of binoculars, winging in from a distance and stacked up in flights looking like nothing as much as squadrons of WWII bombers, in wave after wave.  When they land they start moving parallel to the shore like a rolling carpet, the ones at the front of the flock diving, the ones at the rear taking off and leap-frogging over the seething mass of other birds. It's like a giant vacuum cleaner moving along the bay, and it can go for miles before they've had enough.  At times when the flock is the largest, I've done counts on them, and I have seen flocks that easily top a thousand birds.  Once I estimated 1500. I've contacted the MNR about controlling them and the answer is twofold: 1) We're monitoring them (whatever that means) and 2) Cormorants are native to Lake Nipissing.  Native, my foot.  When I was a kid, I fished Lake Nipissing with great regularity with my parents in the 50's and 60's and we didn't even know what a cormorant looked like.  With all the other fishing pressure on this lake, summer and winter, we (as the expression goes) ""don't need no stinkin' cormorants""!  I know they're a problem elsewhere too. Is there anywhere where they are being controlled?"
349348,Billy Bob,2009-06-07 21:03:00,5865,The tree hugging NUT cases out there will protect these OVER populated birds to no end.

They're in big flocks then, as they're migrating north again. I'd bet if you put a few decoys up in the trees of a small island on any body of water, you'd smash them all day long. I'd be more than willing to donate a few cases of ammo to have a public cull on them.........what fun that would be!!!! We don't need to irradicate them, just keep thier numbers in check. Sure, they're native, but never in the numbers we have now!!! We even have special seasons on geese where you can kill up to 10 birds per hunter per day, and have a couple dozen in your possesion.

349370,JohnF,2009-06-07 21:44:00,3494,"I've come to the conclusion that the tree hugger types don't get it. The natural evolution of our planet is dependent to a very large degree what we humans do to impact it. If we collectively choose to eradicate Cormorants then that's the way it was meant to be. We're the dominant species at the moment. It's ridiculous to say that we mustn't meddle in Mother Nature's grand plan cuz we're an inherent part of it, and so is whatever we do. I know that sounds callous, but the fact is that trying to second guess nature's reaction to our impact is stupid. It is what it is. That being said we all need to be prepared to accept the consequences of our impact, or be prepared to explain to our grandchildren why there are no more Cormorants (they crapped too many islands to death), Manatees (they were too stupid and slow to get out of the way of our props), etc.  Take the island crap murder to it's limit and what do you have? The earth is dead, void of living vegetation. We're too good at protecting those things we deem to need protection. What we don't do so well is compensate for the harm those protected species do to our environment. We try, but we generally get it wrong. Perhaps the smartest move is to go with the flow. When the cormorants are all gone we'll have to deal with the proliferation of whatever little aquatic critters or green growing things (like Kudzu) that is no longer contained by their crapping presence. Mother Nature is way too sophisticated and convoluted for us to win in the guessing game so why not go with our instincts. Fight the Cormorants and the Gobies and the Zebra mussels to the best of our ability. We'll get the most years of comfort and enjoyment out of our planet before we turn it into a dead thing. Given the twists and turns of space planet death is probably inevitable anyway, whether we bring it on or nature does with a huge astroid or a drop in heat from the sun.  We are what we are. If that means we're gonna do ourselves in, so be it. Let's enjoy whatever time we have here. That doesn't mean we have to be totally irresponsible in dumping huge amounts of toxic waste into our ground water, but worrying about the continued existence, even the proliferation, of individual species is most likely beyond our ability as only one more extant animal.  How's that for a huge philosophical rush of blood to the head. Now I'm gonna go and bbq a huge bloody steak and kill off a few potatoes and carrots to boot. I might even open a bottle of wine.

349371,Billy Bob,2009-06-07 21:45:00,5865,Years ago several charter captains on the east end of Lake Ontario (NY) took it upon themselves to take out MANY cormorants with their shotguns on some island. Rumor has it they killed about 500 birds but the word leaked out about the whole deal and some paid hefty fines while others even spent time in jail...  I would of chipped in to bail them out ...
349372,JohnF,2009-06-07 21:51:00,3494,"  When I was a kid my folks would take us to the nearest city (Stratford) to watch the local cops blast at the starlings hanging around the city hall. This was an annual event and was well-attended by watchers. Doesn't seem to have a durned thang for th starlings although I have to say they don't seem to be quite as numerous as they apparently were way back when. That's probably not a bad thang.  I remember as a kid being encouraged to go to the local dump to shoot rats. We'd tape a flashlite to the gun barrel or just shine the car headlights into the garbage. We got lots and lots of huge rats but they don't seem to have gone away because of it. Man does what he's gotta do to control his environment. If we manage to remain the alpha critter we'll keep trying to have our way.  The critters that are meant to survive, like man has so far, will. The others will fade away whatever we do. I believe that.  JF"
349476,Jonny,2009-06-08 02:02:00,1380,"I know that technically cormorants were ""native"" to Lake Nipissing. There were supposedly a few breeding pairs here in the 40's or 50's. So that's the excuse for letting them proliferate on the lake and do nothing. The MNR has totally dropped the ball on this. Personally I think they just can't be bothered to address the problem and so turn a deaf ear, even though they know with absolute certainty that the cormorants are impacting the fish population and they are despoiling islands which now look like a forest fire has scorched the trees dead.  Cormorants are VERMIN... they should be treated as such.  This lake had a perfectly good natural balance when there were NONE of them to be seen. There wouldn't be a single reason to miss them if they were gone. Not a one! If they were rats infesting a town, we'd see some action soon enough, but their impact is underwater and on often remote islands. Out of sight, out of mind, the MNR must figure. On this issue they have ZERO respect from me.  And it sounds like the MNR is similarly inactive, or actually obstructive, on the issue of cormorants in other areas as well."
349483,Sinker,2009-06-08 02:19:00,8692,"MNR......Ministry of NO RESULTS!!  They all know very well about the impact of those sky rats. Its just a long and painful process to do anything about it, and as long as they can sit on thier   and collect thier pay, they won't do a thing about it until its too late.  Same as always, too little, too late!!!!  Sinker"
349598,edmichit,2009-06-08 14:06:00,145,Problem would be solved if they tasted any good.
349606,Jonny,2009-06-08 14:29:00,1380,"I've been told that oiling the eggs would be a good way to get rid of them. Destroy the eggs and they would just lay more, but if they're oiled they'll sit on them but they won't hatch. Anybody else heard that?"
349608,Billy Bob,2009-06-08 14:34:00,5865," Yes, our DEC has been doing this on a limited basis with the Canada goose population here."
349613,Sinker,2009-06-08 14:54:00,8692, Have you tried them??
349618,Jonny,2009-06-08 14:58:00,1380," Think ""fish duck"" (i.e. merganser). Ever try one of those?  I have.  Once."
349721,4thgen,2009-06-08 18:19:00,157," I was going to quote everyhting you've typed but I figure that this single sentence sums up your knowledge of the natural world quite well. Are you actually saying that humans haven't been responsible for any extinctions?  I can see that the ""pseudo-science cormorant hating bandwagon"" is all full up, so I guess I'll just have to take a different path. Hmmm... a species that is growing exponentially and degrading the areas they inhabit? I'm pretty sure that I can think of another species that matches, but on a planetary scale as opposed to a few small islands...  Good luck to all those who live in ignorant bliss, I envy you."
349732,Guest gbfisher,2009-06-08 18:35:00,0,Wait till ya see the Pelicans show up........... I seen one or two every year since the cormorants have come back....  Get out the shot gun and shoot away if they bother you that much. The numbers out on Georgian Bay have declined...maybe cause they went inland.....
349733,Rich Clemens,2009-06-08 18:37:00,3131,"Yeah .... saw two of those suckas flying over the Rideau this past week.   Used to see a lot more, but I guess they have moved on."
349743,Jonny,2009-06-08 18:53:00,1380," I really dislike these ""man is the worst animal"" arguments. They're an excuse for doing nothing when something needs to be done.  We change the natural world when we want to. We do it all the time. In a lot of cases the change is either questionable or downright bad for the environment. That's the basis for your attitude, and I wouldn't say that generally it's a poor attitude; I have that same attitude myself --- most of the time.  But in cases like this, getting rid of a geographic population of a part of a proliferating species is not bad, or even questionable. Like I said, the balance of nature on Nipissing, and I daresay other places in the Great Lakes area, was fine without cormorants. If they degrade the environment, which they do, and if they compete for resources with us, which they do, and if they are an invasive species, which they are, there's absolutely nothing wrong with us doing something about it. Nothing will be affected (except in a positive way) but the cormorants.  Our use and enjoyment of the environment and its resources, within sustainablity guidelines, is a fact and will not change. The presence of cormorants doesn't have to be a fact."
349749,JohnF,2009-06-08 18:59:00,3494," Not saying that at all, at least not with the same meaning you're giving it.  I'm saying that man is an evolving critter on this earth. If it's natural for critters in the wild to eliminate some of their neighbours at some point in their evolution then why is every bit of man's tinkering wrong? Isn't it logical that a certain amount of what man does will impact on other critters? Trying to second guess that process is therefore contrary to the natural course of things in some cases. Perhaps there are certain instances when man simply has to meddle, that it's preordained by Mother Nature and if man doesn't do it, she will some other way. Dunno how we know which times we should and when we shouldn't but are we right to always assume we're wrong about meddling?.  Perhaps the eradication of cormorants is the best way for nature to accommodate evolving man, and by trying to make less of a footprint we actually do more harm in the end. I realize that's kinda convoluted thinking and probably off the mark, but who knows for sure? Perhaps it really just comes down to the survival of the fittest after all.  JF"
349759,laszlo,2009-06-08 19:18:00,487,"this elitist mentality, we as humans have embraced so gracefully, is what blinds us so severely. anything we do to alter the natural state of the environment for the sake of our own 'CONVENIENCES' is so selfish and down right idiotic. when it comes to SURVIVAL…well now this is something different all together."
349771,Headhunter,2009-06-08 19:45:00,5703,"Funny how threads like this one have a way of opening a can of worms! Gonna sit back, grab some popcorn, maybe a cold one and watch this thread crumble in obscurity! Boy am I ever mellowing in my old age! HH  PS... I'll limit the number of breathes I take to ensure that I'm not harming the planet... now if I only had a pair of rocket boots, I wouldn't leave a foot print anywhere... Doh... forgot about carbon!"
349772,JohnF,2009-06-08 19:48:00,3494, Perhaps just put a muffler on the gas passer.  JF
