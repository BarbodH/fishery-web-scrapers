I mean why do I have all these level wind oufits designed for small lake trouting, big water trouting and of course steelies (that's a trout). Not to mention numerous casting outfits designed specifically for walleye.  Oh and my favourite perch outfit on the big lakes, you guessed it......baitcaster.   Guess I'll have to convert to bass fishing."
350738,CLofchik,2009-06-10 16:49:00,854," Uh, you mean those reels that cast like more like a bailless spinning reel with a FIXED spool rather than a baitcaster?  Those ones?   Not as silly as I look trying to lift up my glass at the end of the day with the horrible misshapen claw of a hand I have after it's been cramped up trying to hold a ""low profile"" baitcaster all day.  No wonder those pro's cast so damn fast, their rod hand is done by noon!   Bah haaa haaaa that's an awesome demontration of skill, which is the reason he's using a baitcaster.  The superior casting velocity acheived with spinning reels would make it too easy!   You mean the myriad of outfits designed & promoted to catch the walleye FISHERMEN dontcha? There's this island in the South Pacific that's been setup to help deprogram former cult members, I think it might find some use here.  Some good beach fishing too.......but then again most surf casters are using spinning outfits, oh no!  If it makes you feel better you can retrieve backwards with the reel upside down"

On the scale that is used for bearing is a scale on 1 to 9,by two's 1,3,5.7.9. 1 being the softest. The hard the bearing. The harder it's for the friction to cause heat. Less friction= less drag."

351044,dave524,2009-06-11 14:24:00,4508,"  This is not the first time that concept has been tried. Wish I could remember the manufacturer but I recall pictures of a reel from ads in the 50 or 60's that instead of an eyelet had a piece of square stock with a twist in it that when it revolved would lay the line on the spool evenly. My dad was a tournament caster in the late 40's and early 50's winning T.A.H.A. championships at the C.N.E. , learned to fish with better quality knucklebusters of that era , Langely's , Inglis/Shakespeares , was pretty into it as a teen.  EDIT: found a pic of what I remember, was more of a trolling type reel from Penn, but the concept is so close I would wonder about patent infringement if it applies after 35+ years  http://cgi.ebay.com/Vintage-Penn-LEVELINE-...=item1e5726aa86"

350579,GoneFishin,2009-06-10 05:59:00,349,"You can cast quickly because you pull it out of the water and start casting right away no grabbing your line and flipping your bail, more accuart because you can control your casting distance with your thumb. You CAN cast farther because your bait stays straight in the air because of the little tension on the line. They are geared better for retrieving baits. You can hold more/heavy line on them, and well, they just make your day so much more enjoyable!"
350582,Jonny,2009-06-10 06:20:00,1380," You mean ""correct"". But if your cast is good in the first place, you shouldn't need to correct. And you're working with two variables - the sweep of the rod, and thumb pressure. That unnecessarily complicates things.   That tension on the line is drag. Drag = less distance."
350652,Garry2Rs,2009-06-10 12:53:00,1425,"100% correct again!  It amazes me how you always know exactly what people mean, even though that's not what they said...this is truly an amazing gift! Your analysis of the drag issue with bait cast reels is spot on too! Unlike the your Spincasters and Spinning reels they don't operate in the frictionless vacuum, between your ears."

350679,solopaddler,2009-06-10 13:55:00,8605, Billy!!! I was wondering if someone would bring up that point. I guess all the pros who compete in distance casting competions are doing it all wrong eh?

To say that spinning reel don't suffer from line twist is defying physics... Science doesn't lie.  Pulling power is definitely advantage baitcaster, when was the last time you loaded up your spinning reel with 50lb braid and pulled largies out of the lilly pads? lol  Even 20lb mono is easier handled on a baitcaster then it is a spinning reel.   Your casting performance suffers more on a spinning reel, then it does a bait caster simply because of how the reel is designed and how the line leaves the reel (again, science, physics all that good stuff)"

350158,Cookslav,2009-06-09 14:30:00,1457,"LOL... This thread is hilarious!  You simply cannot pit one over the other as they have different jobs to fill. This is like the Tiller vrs Console Debate  Its all dependant on the ""type"" of fishing your doing.... In an ideal world your not going to use lighter line, and a medium action rod set with spinning gear if your flipping in the slop for Largies... You could...but of course thats not the ideal set up right? On the flip side, your not going to use heavy line with a heavy action rod and bait caster to fish Browns & Bows in the Spring run right?  Each set up has advantages that work better then the other in certain situations. You could easily work one all the time, but by haveing a choice you mearly increase your odds of landing fish, and in some cases Make your day a little easier and less frustrating.  But to each there own... The funny thing about fishing is contrary to popular beleif,  its actually not about catching fish.... Its about having a good time, and enjoying yourself ""while trying"" to catch fish. If a certain combo makes it more enjoyable to you then have at it.  IMO they all have their time and place just like a tiller, or console.  Its cool to have a preference, But a preferance doesn't make it better for all..."
350159,Jonny,2009-06-09 14:36:00,1380," No, experience doesn't lie, like I just explained above. Some line twist happens on spinning reels, granted (I already did), but line twist is a non-issue in spinning reels used for casting because whatever twist is there is unnoticeable. Spinning reels aren't popular for casting for nothing.   You fish them with 50 lb braid!? Now that's specialized fishing! Akin to me using 50 lb steel line on my #47 Penn Mariner to horse those lake trout up from the depths.   As I've already pointed out, it doesn't suffer. If it did happen, spinning reels would rightly be shunned. In actual practice, a spinning reel works fine, cast after cast."
350160,BillM,2009-06-09 14:41:00,17367,"Load your spinning reel up with 20lb mono and I'll do the same with my bait caster, I guarantee you I'll out cast you every single time without much effort.  Are you honestly going to argue that?  You should start using facts and not your 'personal experiences' to try and prove points, they'll hold a lot more water.  The next thing you'll tell me is that centerpins don't suffer from line twist either."

My 10 year old has been throwing a bait caster for three years.  Get out and practice !!!  If you don't want to use one then don't but don't put down something just cause you don't know how to use it properly or have never tried.
350173,Roy,2009-06-09 15:07:00,13728,"I can cast farther than you! hahahaha I can cast as far with my baitcasters as with my spinning reels but that's certainly not the goal. The farther away the bait is from me, the less control I have over it. They both have their application but I now have 3 baitcasters to every one spinning reel. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of line over runs I get in a season. I get more line loops around the rod tip with spinning reels than birdsnest....by a long shot.  But hey, that's just my opinion."
350199,Jonny,2009-06-09 15:42:00,1380," Probably not, as I haven't made the comparison myself in any meaningful way where I would stake what I say on it, because my spinning reels are loaded with 14 lb at the maximum. The 20 lb I mentioned I clearly qualified with a disadvantage, and I don't use it. To quote myself:    In case you haven't noticed, this thread is all about personal experience, from both sides. Unless of course if you think that someone with a preference for baitcasters states only facts and someone with a preference for spinning reels states only conjecture.  You don't believe when I tell you that I've casted for hundreds of hours with a spinning reel and not noticed line twist degrading performance? Fine. You can believe I was lying just so I could make a point.   You're not reading, you're projecting. I've already made two things clear - 1) Spinning reels have a line twist problem when used for trolling with certain baits  2) A certain amount of line twist, though it might be present from casting, is not detrimental to performance.   Using a baitcaster isn't rocket science. If you're a fisherman you don't have much problem using a baitcaster.  I don't believe I've ever stated that a spinning reel is better than a baitcaster, but a thread like this certainly flushes out those who think a baitcaster is sine qua non and is somehow elite equipment. Like this very comment, implying that someone with a preference for a spinning reel (for most fishing) is somehow incompetent."

350224,CLofchik,2009-06-09 16:43:00,854," Lol, I use a baitcaster & heavy rod with 20lb PP for steel in the spring.  Actually it's my favourite way to fish for them, though I don't do it often anymore. And I use a heavy spinning outfit to fish for bass in the summer.  Heh, I have problems with convention I guess   Put a 1oz. weight onto your heavy spinning outfit. Put a 1oz. weight onto your heavy casting outfit.  Open bail/freespool at the same time.  Which one hit the ground first?  Gee, the one with the less resistance.  Psssst I'll give you a hint, it's spool doesn't revolve.  This more than anything pretty much highlights alot of peoples misconceptions, spinning outfits don't stop at 6'6"" ubiquitous ""medium light"" with 2000 sized reels.  More than anything I've used 14-20lb. mono, and now braid, on my spinning outfits for twenty years.  Before I had a drivers license I was chucking 1-2oz. rigs with spinning outfits, and always out distanced baitcasters.  I've had this argument dozens of times on the pierheads, against four or five different generations of baitcasters.  And still your $500 baitcaster with a computer chip and self engergizing diodes can't outcast a lowly Mitchell 300 with 20lb mono.  Can't be done, just can't, so stop arguing casting distance, it's bringing a knife to a gunfight.  Now can people come up with scenarios (excuses?) where baitcasters are better?  Sure, but I can't think of a single time I thought slinging 100lb. mono with a 16oz. lure/anchor/depth charge was actually a good way to go about catching fish.  Must be a good workout though.  It's like justifying a Hummer.  Baitcasters are fishing bling.   Aaaargh, I still can't quite figure what the most annoying sound in all of fishingdom is.  It's a close call between carpers and their beep-beep pods and that damn electronic Shimano.  Wheeeeeeeezzz, sounds like a nerdy mouse with tuberculosis."

I am real good with a spinning reel, but cannot come close to the consistent accuracy that I get with a baitcaster. This only applies when casting to cover. In open-water situations, I will take the spinning reel any time. If you always cast to open water, and distance is an issue, then spinning reels are going to do it for you. If you want pinpoint accuracy to cover, then a baitcaster is a better tool.  Drag? Using the drag on a spinning reel is for folks that don't know how to backreel"
349917,Jonny,2009-06-08 23:54:00,1380," OK, but what do most baitcasters do? The standard models come with right-hand crank, don't they, even though most people are right-handed? Some baitcasting reel don't come in left-hand models, and you pay extra on a lot of reels to get left-hand crank. So unless I'm mistaken, most right-handers will cast with the right hand and then switch the rod to the left hand for retrieve. Doesn't make any sense.   That's like calling a trout fisherman who fishes with worms a bigot, when it's the fly fishermen who are the ones with ""attitude"".  Of course a levelwind is better for heavy gear. I wouldn't claim it wasn't. You're right that certain things have certain uses, but even the term ""baitcaster"" puts an implied limit on what we're actually talking about - using a reel to cast for fish. As far as ""feel"" is concerned, it's probably impossible to have better feel with a good baitcaster than a good spinning reel, or vice versa. All your reel does is take up line; if you think about it, it's the quality and weight of the rod that gives you ""feel"", wouldn't you say?  ""Friction on retrieve is waaaay higher"" - I'd be interested to know what you think would cause that. The friction of the line coming in through the guides should be the same. You think the line passing over a roller on the bail of a spinning reel makes for ""way"" more friction?   I've been casting all my life. Yeah, I can put it where I want it almost all the time. Can't you?   Now that's something that makes sense.   I mentioned it primarily because there were a couple of comments about the bail on a spinning reel being a nuisance. Anyone who fishes a lot with a baitcaster is sure to be proficient despite the switch, or the necessity for a two-handed cast. Anyone who fishes a lot with a spinning reel is sure to find that opening the bail is second nature.  I wouldn't argue that a spinning reel is better than a baitcaster but I'm skeptical that a baitcaster is better than a spinning reel. I think a good portion of it is just mystique. But yes, of course there are situations which call for a level-wind (not necessarily a baitcaster), and there may be a few particular ways in particular situations where a baitcaster might be preferred (i.e. ""pitching""), just like a spinning reel might be for others.  I've never intentionally targeted largemouth. We have very few in Northeastern Ontario. But I can cast into a small open spot in lily pads, or hit just at the edge of the branches of a fallen tree or a beaver house.  I love using my Ambassador to troll (14 lb test) but not because I think it's better, just because it's different. And for heavier trolling I like using my Penn 209. For the rest I think my spinning reels are fine, and it would be very hard to out-do them, having more to do with the proficiency of the person using the equipment rather than the equipment itself."
349923,Jonny,2009-06-09 00:11:00,1380,"The stuff about less tumbling of the bait, and splashless entry (if you think that in a particular situation you'd rahter go with not spooking fish than with getting their attention), makes sense, but precisely because there is more drag to casting than to spinning. The baitcasting reel has an initial inertia to overcome, and the speed of the spool determines how fast the line will go out. But that, if you think about it, makes a baitcasting reel less likely to give you as long a cast as a spinning reel, contrary to some of what I'm reading here."
349941,Bernie66,2009-06-09 00:38:00,123,"It is like the mono vs braid debate.  There is a time and a place for everything.  You wouldn't use a baitcaster when you are fishing for walleye with a 1/8 oz jig, conversely you wouldn't flip for largies in the mats on spinning gear with 30lb line. There is however one advantage baitcasters have over spinning that no one have mention, line twists. When drag is pulled on a baitcaster, line come straight off the spool.  With a spinning reel, line twist is inherent in the design everytime you retrieve line and when line is pulled off against the drag."

349968,Garry2Rs,2009-06-09 01:07:00,1425,"You spinning guys have it 100% right... I will buy all your nasty old casting reels for five dollars each, so you can buy some new line to replace the twisted stuff you used last week."
349975,JohnF,2009-06-09 01:21:00,3494, U R a tricksy one.  JF
349988,Pigeontroller,2009-06-09 01:49:00,2793,Asking this question means you have not used a casting rod/reel for its intended purpose very much. When it comes to casting lures such as spinnerbaits and crankbaits(Bass or Muskie sized) you can not beat a Baitcast rod/reel. That doesn't mean there's anything wrong with sticking to a Spinning outfit if thats what works for you.
349993,dada2727,2009-06-09 01:54:00,108,"My 2 cents....  Both rods have their place, but as a general rule of thumb, spinners are better for lighter applications and baitcasters for heavier as a general rule of thumb.  I wouldn't spool anything over 12lb test on a spinning reel personally.  Baitcasters have far better control, you can't argue that factor.  I have my thumb on the spool the whole time, I can slow it down whenever I want.  Also, I believe that baitcaster cast heavier baits further too.   When you cast a spinning reel, the line comes of in circles the size of the spool, which creates a lot of friction in that first guide.  That's why the first guide on spinning rods are much larger than baitcasters.  And if a baitcaster has a non-disengaging levelwind, there is less friction going through the guids than a spincaster, thus giving you more distance.  This is all assuming that you have all your brakes backed right off which most of us do anyways after we learn to thumb the spool.  A disadvantage of the baitcaster is casting in wind.  This is where the spincast takes over, they just simply cast better into the wind.  flippin and pitchin'-baitcaster for accuracy, quiet entry and power to turn heads in weeds.  Finesse fishing - spincast  Musky fishing - All baitcasting in my opinion.  They last thing I wanna do is hold a 16 oz bait by my finger all day!  To sum it all up, trying to decide which one is better is like trying to decide whether a 5 iron or a 9 iron is better is golf.  They each have thier own situations where one shines over the other."
349999,brw,2009-06-09 02:02:00,101,"For me it's a matter of ergonomics. Try casting a 4-5 inch swimbait or a large jerkbait for a long time on a spinning reel and it will take a toll on the wrists. Same thing with trolling with a big bait w/ a spinner. It's nice to take a break from the spinning reel with a different profile reel like a baitcaster. Also, the other posters make a good point about the ability of a baitcaster to put some muscle and real cranking power to a large fish headed for wood or thick weeds. Give them a shot by practicing with a rubber sinker in the backyard until you get proficient. Once you get comfortable with how to control them, I bet you'll enjoy them and add them to your arsenal.  Hope this helps and good luck. Only 4 days until we leave for NE corner of Georgian Bay. Hope a 10 lb eye and a 20 lb pike are in my boys' near future...."
350001,duber,2009-06-09 02:03:00,220,Anyone mention that you can cover water with a baitcaster faster than a spinning real.I like both but if I need to find fish fast I'll pick up my curado.
350010,Jonny,2009-06-09 02:19:00,1380," I actually asked the question primarily to see if there was anything behind the mystique. I see that there are a couple of things, but considering most of the fishing I do, I don't see changing things too much, except giving my baitcaster a little more of a look in certain situations.   I don't get line twist. I either use my baitcaster or Penn for trolling, and that's the only thing where line twist has ever been an issue for me, and only with certain kinds of terminal tackle.  You can see by your offer how overpriced a lot of casting reels actually are.  Just kidding, really. If you like 'em, buy 'em.  One of the slickest casters I ever had was a spincast. Now there's a whole other story!"

Accuracy is nice, quiet presentation as well.. though with practice both can be achieved with a spinning reel too. But once you toss that plastic bait into that little pocket in the brushpile with your spinning reel, good luck horsing him out with light line!"
350032,Cudz,2009-06-09 02:54:00,2652,"Heavy line applications -  Baitcaster Pitching/flipping - Baitcaster Pulling power - Baitcaster 1/2 oz + lures - Baitcaster Trolling - Baitcaster Speed from time bait is out of the water until it is back in again on a cast - Baitcaster (watch KVD fish!!!) I also belive that a good baitcaster has a smoother drag than a spinning reel.  Light line applications (10 pound and under) - spinning finesse fishing, drop shot, shakey head, wacky 4"" senko - spinning dragging tubes - spinning throwing into the wind - spinning throwing light lures - spinning"
350057,Bassaholic,2009-06-09 04:02:00,74,"  I'm no expert but here's my take. I'm just 25 but I've been fishing for about 24 of those years. For most of those early years I used spinning gear exclusively and was basically happy with it. But about 10yrs ago I got my first baitcaster and it really opened my eyes. I suddenly was able to fish certain techniques that I wasn't able to before. Flipping jigs, 1/2oz spinnerbaits, buzzbaits, frogs and crankbaits just were never easy to fish on normal spinning gear. Now sure if you're content with just using #7 jointed Rapalas and lures under 1/4oz all the time then stick with spinning gear. But if you want to be able to fish different techniques and not struggle with it then I'd recommend a good baitcaster to any new bass angler. Bottom line is personally I'd never go back to just using all spinning gear. But I still love my spinning reels for tubes, dropshots and other light plastics...oh and like garry said if anyone has been influenced by some of the ""advice"" given here and now want to sell their ""overrated"" baitcasters I'll gladly take them off their hands for $5.50."
350058,charlesn,2009-06-09 04:06:00,551,"OK, a couple more points.  Everyone seems to discount spinning tackle for heavy duty slop and stuff but consider this, a lot of giant bass have been caught on a 14-15' cane pole with NO reel.  Just dippin' into the pockets with a line and a big arse pole.  And for the spinning purists, consider the walleye pros that use handlining in lieu of a spinning reel.  Are they just trying to prove a point?  I think this proves that the reel is just a part of the equation and everybody has their favourite based on the technique.  Holdfast, I know you're probably just stirring the pot to agitate suckers like me, but well, I just can't resist.  You're saying that professionals fishing for hundreds of thousands of dollars, sometimes up to a million dollars at an event will use inferior equipment because it was given to them?  Really?!?  So these professionals are not like in any other profession where they try to use the best (within reason) equipment for the job?  They risk losing a million dollars to save a couple thousand dollars on reel purchases?  All just to get suckers like me to buy these fancy shmancy shiny bait cast reels?  Well, it worked as I own a bunch!  lol  Jocko, there is a tremendous and underutilized largemouth fishery on Nipissing from what I've heard.  I was really looking forward to going up there but the tournament series folded and it's far enough of a drive to dissuade me from trying a day trip.  The last major tournament up there was won on largemouth and not from a lack of smallmouth experts as all the top guns were there.  I think the simple fact is that they are overlooked.  Even the last time I was on Nipissing maybe 10 years ago, there was a decent population of largies in South Bay in the pads and reeds.  If Lakair was a weekend later I'd even try to come up and prove it as when given the choice, I'll always target largies first."
350069,holdfast,2009-06-09 05:32:00,1813," Yup and I will stand up to what I say.  Thats why they look like walking Bill Boards when they go fishing.  And they will use inferior Expensive equipment if it gives them money.  Of course to lure you Charles, the Consumer to buy the product.  Just because Bob uses Yummy doesnt mean it really out catches fish that swim."
350087,duber,2009-06-09 11:38:00,220,What Cudz said sums up my thoughts exactly.

350113,Garry2Rs,2009-06-09 12:53:00,1425,"If you don't have line twist problems, you need to get out more! The design of spinning and spincasting reels puts twist into the line.  If your doubt my word, buy a paper streamer at the dollar store and pull the ribbon off the end of the spool the way the line comes off of all spinning reels.  Spincaster's work by pinching the line between the spool and the close-face housing when you push the button, this is not a light weight line friendly design...On the cast the line flows off the spool, up over the spool lip and then must immediately funnel down to go through the small opening in the housing...That's at approaches four 45 degree turns in about one inch...The word is friction and it steals distance from your cast.  Dear spinning friends and line twist devotees: I have no intention of getting into a bidding war with Bassaholic, but I will match his offer of $5.50 a piece for all of your birds nest building, curse causing, hackle raising, hair tearing, ire invoking, mentally challenging, nerve fraying, out-dated, over-rated, poorly produced, questionable-quality, rage-raising, stomach knotting, spool-jamming, temper twisting, ulcer causing, vomit launching, wrist wrecking, wretched and exasperating baitcasting reels. Thank You 2R's"
350126,Jonny,2009-06-09 13:20:00,1380,"Cudz you mention ""pulling power""...  I can't see this being ""advantage baitcaster"". If I want pulling power with a spinning reel, I can use a slightly heavier line (i.e. 14 lb test) and a slightly heavier, shorter rod. Then set the drag at the heavy end and I can pull to turn a fish or get it out of cover as well as a baitcaster could. Both are limited by how much strain you can put on the line. What test of line are you talking about for pulling power on a baitcaster? You can horse a fish, yes, but the heavier you go in test, the more you sacrifice in casting performance with either type of reel. I can (and have) put 20 lb in a spinning reel, and I can pull the boat with it when I get snagged! But I lose distance.  And speed (bait in to bait out)...  I think you probably have a point there, if a few seconds per cast is important, but I just don't see myself emulating the tourney fishermen to whom whipping the water is a necessity. I tend to fish with less frenzy because I'm out for recreation, not to win a prize.  ***  I've been thinking more about the idea that baitcasters can throw more accurately. I wonder if it boils down to baitcasters tending to go with heavier baits. You can throw a heavier bait more accurately than a light bait... but that holds true for a spinning reel as well.  Those one-pound baits that some guys are talking about? I'd never cast for any length of time with one of those. Them's trollin' baits, son, on a levelwind and a stiff rod.   You could very well be right, Charles. I used to catch some largemouth in weedy areas like Marsh Bay (near the mouth of the French), but I don't get there any more. The north side of the lake has less of that sheltered water, but I'm sure there must be a few largemouth here. I moved here just a few years ago and I've avoided spots like that because they're just so chock full of rocky shoals. But I've got a few ideas about places to try along the shore if I can winkle myself in there with my 2 HP kicker."
350136,Jonny,2009-06-09 13:52:00,1380," I get out plenty, thanks.  I don't need to do a ""test"". My test is what works, and I can fish with the same line all summer - some still fishing, some drifting, a lot of casting - and I don't have to worry about twist. If the line has a little twist in it, it's so minor as to be unnoticeable. The place where twist is a nuisance is with trolling baits that will twist the line (i.e. lures and spoons, but not with Rapalas and the like), but I use level-wind for that. I don't think you've fished consistently with a spinning reel if you think that casting causes a problem with line twist.  When I was a teenager I fished with probably an intensity I've never matched, shore-fishing stretches of the Vermillion River for pike and bass, usually with cheap Canadian Tire imitations of Daredevils because I could afford to lose a few. Those suckers will twist up the line on a spinning reel so badly if you use them for trolling that I bet nothing can match them. But I would cast all day with them, day after day, hundreds of casts a day, and I didn't have a problem.  If I had had line twist it would have robbed me of casting distance (REALLY important if you're shore-fishing). So no, I don't buy the line twist argument one bit, except for trolling with certain types of bait.   Yes, I'm aware of that. But go figure, I've used a couple of spincasters that can cast like hell. They shouldn't, but they do. Smooth and LONG. I have no idea why.   The baitcaster manufacturers can see you coming. It's the mystique thing. Premium price for ""premium"" gear.  But no, it's also likely that it's more expensive to produce a good baitcaster than it is to produce a good spinning reel, because of the disadvantage in physics that has to be overcome. The line flows freely off a spinning reel, without the spool moving, so it's only the diameter of the spool and the design of the lip of the spool, and how full it is of line, that determine how the line slips off the reel. In a baitcaster, the spool has to rotate at a precise speed because if it goes too slow it will drag on the bait and cut your distance, and if it goes too fast you'll end up with a nice backlash. The spinning reel is just a simpler, more efficient design."
349614,Jonny,2009-06-08 14:56:00,1380,"When I was a kid, I was taught to fish with a spinning reel, and I still can't see an advantage to using a baitcaster (levelwind).  Is there a baitcaster out there that can top a spinning reel for distance, for example?  I remember the days in the 50's when my Mom, who liked a levelwind for trolling, would try once in a while to cast with it and end up with some beautiful backlash birdnests. I know they're much better now, but I still can't warm up to a baitcaster for casting. I have a nice Abu-Garcia Ambassador and use it for trolling."
349619,Raf,2009-06-08 15:00:00,3495,"let me know a spinning reel that'll cast a 16oz lure.  spinning reels have their places.. ie. jigging, ice fishn and casting light baits ie. weightless plastics for bass"
349626,Lunker777,2009-06-08 15:04:00,866,"New to the sport myself... so Ill try and give my 2 cents. A baitcaster has more torque than a spinning reel to help pull those fish out of the weeds. They also help with line spin as they are levelwind. Plus I think they are built a little heavier to help with the bigger fish. As far as casting distance, I think I could cast my bait caster just as far as my spinning reels depending on the lures of course. But spinning is good for lighter lures and plastics. Thats the only place I would use them. Again, Im not a pro so... I just thought I would add some input haha"

349659,muddler,2009-06-08 16:22:00,623,There's a couple of advantages to using a bait cast outfit over a spinning outfit.  The one I like the most is thumb control. I can control the length of a cast by using my thumb to shorten the cast by just pressing on the spool.  I can keep the line pinched between my thumb and index finger when fishing a plastic worm. I can feel the light pickup trough the line way easier than using a spinning oufit.  Surface lures are just easier to conrol/fish than on a spinnining outfit.  Drag can be icreased by just using your thumb on the spool. Great for emergengy turning of a big fish.  A properly balanced baitcaster just feels lighter than a spinning outfit.   muddler
349687,hirk,2009-06-08 17:25:00,571,"The single biggest reason to use one now? Accuracy,yes you can spool spinning reels with heavy braid and get heavy rods which used to be an advantage to casting reels but you will never beable to place a lure as accurately with a spinning reel."
349689,John Bacon,2009-06-08 17:37:00,3277,"If I try casting a large Suick with a spinning real, it will foul the lure on almost every cast.  I don't have this problem when casing with a bait caster.  The Suick will tumble through the air when I cast with a bait caster, the line will end up wrapped around the lure on almost every cast.  With a bait caster the lure will fly backward through the air and not tumble; and thus avoid wrapping the line around the lure."
349707,CLofchik,2009-06-08 17:59:00,854,"I don't know about accuracy, I can fire offhand casts alot easier with a spinning outfit than a baitcaster, like seeing a fish or fishy structure at 3 o'clock after retrieving in from 10 o'clock.  And there's no switching hands with a spinning reel.  And I hate how wet my hands get with spray off the line on a baitcaster.  I've always preferred spinning over casters, but am making a deliberate effort this year to get more proficient with them.  Really just because I own a few that have been barely touched and it seems like a waste, I don't know if I'll ever buy another caster that isn't meant for trolling.  Spinning:  Longer casts, no you can't cast a similiar sized lure the same distance with a baitcaster.  You just can't.....get over it. Price, spinning reels are about 1/3 cheaper. Better drags on spinning reels, you just can't cram anywhere near the disc surface in a casting reel. Retrieve, you can pick up slack line or running fish alot quicker on spinning reels.  Casting:  Lighter, more compact setup thats better the heavier your line gets.  In my mind the cutoff point is around 20lb/test, around there you're better off with a lighter casting reel to fish all day than some 14oz. spinning monstrosity.  2000 or 3000 sized spinning reels just aren't built strong enough to handle that strength that for long before exploding.   4000 sized reels are getting too big to be casting all day.  More capacity for size.  Really more of a concern for trolling, but if you need more than 200m of line on a reel you need a caster."
349754,BillM,2009-06-08 19:07:00,17367," I dunno about this one...  I could see with a lower end, or mid level reel, but if you have ever made a cast with a good baitcaster, they go for miles.   I can rocket Zara Spook Jr's with my Shimano Calais further then I ever have with a spinning outfit, not to mention the control I have over it compared to a spinning setup.  A night and day difference between that and the Citica I started out with.  I won't even mention how far I can toss muskie lures with my Abu Record 60/Shimano Compre 8' combo.  Alot of the distance has to do with a combination of the correct rod/reel for the job."
349766,CLofchik,2009-06-08 19:39:00,854," Yup. And I've done enough spinning vs. casting throwdowns on the pier heads to put that issue to rest permanently.  I just don't get how people can even think to argue that somehow there's some magic bearings that will make a baitcasters spool revolve with less friction than simply line flowing off a fixed spool.  Just think about it a sec, can't be done. Equal length rods, equal action rods, same line, same size lure.....spinning will outdistance casters every time.  Won't even be close.  Find me at the end of August casting for salmon and we'll wager on it.  And about ""control""........I'd wager it would take a newbie alot less time to learn how to feather line off a spinning reel than learning how to merely cast a baitcaster.  Face it, for the most part baitcasters are fishing bling toys.  If you're not trolling for salmon or casting for muskies there is precious little advantage to baitcasters, toss price in the equation and it's no contest.  There is simply nothing in freshwater you can do with a baitcaster you can't learn to do just as well with a spinning reel, alot of things you can do alot better with spinning reels, and cheaper.  ""But I can work a bait slower with more precision with a baitcaster!"" -- Uh......just slow down. ""But I can cast more accurately with a baitcaster!"" --  Sure.....pitching baits 30' away in thick weeds for largemouth you might have a point.  So if all you do is fish for largemouth in thick weeds all summer long go nuts.  Double that length to an actual cast in anything approaching open water and it becomes pointless.  What were the other advantages of baitcasters again?  Sincerely CL, Team Spinning Advocate"
349804,BillM,2009-06-08 20:55:00,17367,"Hrm....  The gear design of a baitcaster is far stronger then that of a spinning wheel.  That's not my opinion, that's physics.  (I dunno if you want to argue this one, but by all means give it a shot)  Sure your spinning reel is easier to fish, but that makes it better?  Sounds like the bait caster got the best of you recently   I find my bait caster a lot more enjoyable to fish (but again that's personal preference)  I'm not even going to bring up the fact that your spinning reel has a bail and a bail spring, you lose points just for that.  Casting anything larger then a 1-2oz lure, advantage bait caster.  Comfort, line control and accurate casting.... bait caster.  Although comfort is a personal thing, you can scratch that off the list if you want.  Lighter lines, lighter lures.... spinning setup for sure.  Furthest casting? Depends completely on what you are throwing, I think there are to many factors (rod length, action, lure weight, line etc etc)  But I'll definitely bring a bait cast setup and toss Cleo's with you off the pier in the fall.  Just and FYI, I'll bring what's best for the job, don't handicap me with your spinning rod specifications"
349811,Jonny,2009-06-08 21:07:00,1380,"I've fished with spinning reels all my life, and baitcasters here and there, and I have to say that CLofchik says a lot of things that I would say.  Distance - just not possible for a well-matched baitcaster combo to outcast a well-matched spinning outfit for just about all of the casting possibilities. CLofchik mentioned why.  Accuracy - Defnitely no more accurate than a spinning reel combo in good, practiced hands.  Casting control with finger on the spool - not necessary when you can already cast accurately.  Line compatibility - yes baitcasters can take heavier line, that's what makes them good trolling reels. For the normal 6 to 14 lb. test for casting, that's a moot point.  Thumb on the spool for extra drag -  why? To ""turn"" a big fish? You'll turn him when he gets tired, and he'll tire faster if your drag is set well. Mess with a well-set drag and PING, there goes your line.  Quick slack for light-biting fish - with a spinning reel, you fish with an open bail and hold the line againat the rod handle with your index finger. Instant slack.  Line feel - you can pinch the line between thumb and index on a spinning reel too.  Still fishing or drifting - toss up. It's nice to fish with something different once in a while, so a baitcaster can be nice. Disadvantage - every time you put your rod down, it turns upside down. On the other hand, the weight on a spinning outfit is where it shoud natually be, on the bottom of the rod.  Ease of use - Here's a thing that's got me wondering. Me being a lefty, I find a baitcaster perfect for me because I handle the rod with my left hand and crank with the right. But what about right-handers? Baitcasters virtually all crank with the right hand, as far as I know. Do right-handers actually retrieve with the left hand holding the rod, and cast with the right hand??? If that's so, that's a HUGE drawback, having to change hands for every cast and retrieve.  Cost - baitcast manufacturers obviously see you coming.  Mystique - I guess baitcasters win hands-down."
349817,Bondar,2009-06-08 21:23:00,817,"on  my spinning outfits i reel with my left hand and hold with my right,  same as my casting reels (left handed version)"
349824,camillj,2009-06-08 21:31:00,1988,"I grew up as a spinning bigot (partly because I just couldnt get a baitcaster to match my ability with spinning gear... but all that changed since Lew introduced me to a Calcutta 400 CT .... I would NEVER think of tossing a musky bait with anything else now.... as for trolling for goliaths in salt water there is no question that the big PENN's out perform anything that spins ... period .... I still DO however love my Whisker 1300 on a 10 1/2' rod for drifting steel (or tossing a cleo from a pier)... so everything has its place and if used properly has its advantages ... for example,  I wouldnt even consider putting lead-core on a spinning outfit - the reel would last a week.  By the way speaking about friction, the friction on the retrieve is wayyyy higher on spinning gear than on the baitcaster ... and for my money (since I have no trouble reaching the target most times) the real difference in feel comes when you are fighting a fish (or working your bait)... my next investment is more likely to be a high quality baitcaster than another spinning reel ... just my 3 1/2 cents."
349830,salmon,2009-06-08 21:40:00,334,"Yep I grew up using spinning gear exclusively. But now I have a Steez, Calais 100 and an Calais 200DC, I have not touched a spinning reel.  Hey CLofchik I' ll take you up on the friendly side by side casting competition. Jose"
349833,BillM,2009-06-08 21:57:00,17367," It must be awesome to make perfect casts, 100% of the time"
349837,charlesn,2009-06-08 21:58:00,551,"Saying one is better than the other for all things is probably an over generalization.   If one was better for everything, do you think pros fishing for upwards of a MILLION dollars would not just always use the ""better"" reel.  Certain conditions and techniques can have an equipment preference, but it is certainly not a limiting factor.  Baitcasting affords a few technique specific advantages related to the entry of the bait in to the water.  Pitching is a technique integral to largemouth bass fishing.  A soft, subtle entry of the bait in to the water is a key element of the technique.  You can do it with a spinning rod, but it is very difficult to master the splashless entry compared to a baitcaster.  Even a novice can master a splashless entry with a baitcaster with some practice.  Feathering the spool on a spinning rod is a lot harder to  master with the heavier baits used predominantly for bass.  On the other hand, skipping a bait like a senko under a dock or tree with a spinning reel is a lot easier for a novice than with a baitcaster.  Can it be done, yes, I have seen guys skip a big fat flippin' jig with a baitcaster with uncanny accuracy for a remarkable distance, but that takes a lot of practice.  But just about anyone can pick up a spinning rod and begin skipping baits.  And maybe it's just me but for side-arm casting spinnerbaits around and under targets (flooded timber for example) a baitcaster is just a lot more comfortable and getting that silent entry even on longer casts is a lot easier with baitcasting.  For dropping a bait down in deep water on a fish you see on the graph, the spinning rod does a better job for the applications I have tried (tube, drop-shot & spoon) because it allows for a freer truer fall.  Another thing to consider is line twist.  Line twist is inherent in a spinning reel's design and can be a very frustrating thing, more frustrating than a backlash in a baitcaster because a backlash once it is picked out is done with.  Line twist even if you can ""save it"" the first time or two, just gets worse and worse and you have to respool to totally get rid of it.  For me I'd say I fish about 50/50 of each.  Smallies are fished primarily with spinning and Largies primarily with baitcasting.  But I always have both.  I have used a screwdriver as a hammer in the past, but if I can, I'd prefer to carry both.  As far as switching hands when casting (but not pitching), this is an often over exaggerated thing.  I have done it since I first picked up a baitcaster and can tell you that by the time the bait has entered the strike zone (water) my hands are in a position to set the hook and I have never once missed a fish from switching hands.  I don't cast one-handed though, all of my actual casting (spinning or baitcasting) is of the two-handed variety as perhaps I am a weakling.  lol  The Baitcaster vs Spinning wars pre-date the internet, but the truth remains that there will be advantages for one or the other in some techniques and they will be a matter of preference for some techniques, but there is not a single technique out there that you simply could not do with one or the other.  Fish what you enjoy fishing with.  The fish really don't care!"
349841,drwxr,2009-06-08 22:02:00,453, mind sharing some pictures of the 16 oz lure? just curious...
349846,BillM,2009-06-08 22:09:00,17367, Musky Innovations makes a 15inch 16oz Super Magnum Bulldawg.  
349875,holdfast,2009-06-08 23:05:00,1813," Agree 100 Percent.  Bait casters way overrated.  People buy them because the pros use em.  but they get them for free.  My Bait Casters when used are for trolling.  Advantage- Holds more line, Balances better with a Bigger Rod, no Line twist to wory about.  Disadvantages- Uncomfortable, Casts are weaker and more prone to Tangle.  Drag system sucks, Not as smooth.  EXPENSIVE and Breaks more often  Oh- If I was ever going to use a 16 Oz Jig, Id invest in two Spinning Reels with one heavier.  Cheaper than one Baitcaster.    Way Way Overated.  Its Marketing and sucker fishermen."
349884,drwxr,2009-06-08 23:17:00,453,"i like the info in this post since i never used baitcaster myself, but just wondering if anyone used surf spinning reels for musky, i read that suft fishing guys use heavy sinkers kind of like that bull dawg, that is one huge lure BillM."
