350407,bassboy,2009-06-09 23:48:00,161," Thanks BillM.  You took the words right out of my mouth.    Lunker.....if you have A-plan it will knock at least 3k off I think......I buy mine on A/Z plan and thats what I seem to remember. A plan is almost always BELOW the cost of what the dealer can even pay for it IIRC.  The Five-0 event is still on according to their website (0 down, 0% interest, 0$ first months payment, 0 due on delvery and 0 security deposit)......so I would go to another dealer if you are still interested, and dont mess around with pricing.....just tell them its A plan then they cant screw you......Some dealers do not like to sell on A plan because they make very little on it. I thought the practice of turning away A plan sales went away but it seems its still going on......"

Milage towing was atrocious, and had no guts on the hills, I think the new ones are only rated at 24 miles a gallon, Would'nt thank you for another one."
350610,Lunker777,2009-06-10 10:59:00,866, What engine did it have ? and was it 2wd or 4x4
350627,boatman,2009-06-10 11:54:00,350," Sounds like someone who has no experience with a Ranger.  I asked this same question a few years ago. After reading all the reviews and getting all the biased answers I decided to buy a Ranger. Now keep in mind I'm not partial to any automaker, but if I was it would be GM trucks over Ford. I much prefer our GM work trucks to our Fords.  The truck I bought replaced a 1999 Cavalier Z24 that I used to haul my 14.5' boat with 30 hp motor shown in my avatar. I decided to buy a 2004 extended cab EDGE with 3.0L engine, auto trans in 2x4. I bought my boxliner from a member here for half price compared to all other sources at the time. I believe it was Percher from Burlington (sorry if I got that wrong). Contact him if you need one.  My truck now has 120,000 km. Aside from regular oil changes I hadn't put anything into it until recently. I replaced the MAF sensor at 110,000 km. I replaced the muffler and flushed the brake fluid yesterday. I will need new front brakes soon, but the rear are fine.  I only have three complaints about the truck.  1) The seat has no height adjustment. At only 6 feet tall my head is nearly bumping the ceiling. 2) I should have bought 4x4. Snowy/icy roads are trouble. Never any trouble at the boat launch. 3) The OEM pads seem extra soft and leave dust like crazy.  I'll drive this truck until it dies. Then I will research its replacement. I may not end up with another Ford, but I would not hesistate to buy another Ranger. In the current market place with the current vehicles available I would choose the Ranger again. To me, resale means nothing since I plan to use the truck up. Therefore, there is no benefit to buying a Toyota or Nissan since they are no more reliable.  It is of course, your choice. Good luck with whatever you choose."

350737,Billy Bob,2009-06-10 16:44:00,5865,"Most times you are really much better off with a full size truck.......the small/mid size trucks DO NOT get much better gas mileage than the full size trucks and get LESS mileage than what a full size truck gets when towing. Not to mention how much taxing is being placed on that smaller tow vehicle.  I have had both so I am speaking from experience.......not to mention how much better  and SAFER towing is with a full size truck.  That was my #1 reason I went back to a full size truck. I have towed my boat all over the US and through Ontario and when I had a smaller truck I really had to watch myself on long trips. If I was fully loaded I would have to stay at 60 mph at the most and then leave plenty of room for stopping. I was always a bit nervous while towing with my FORD Escape......... I no longer have those fears with my full size truck.  But to each his own.....but if you think you are  going to save a  lot of gas with the smaller tow vehicle, well it just doesn't work out like that......."
350742,wask,2009-06-10 17:07:00,174,"I had a 94 Ranger that I towed an 1978 15 foot (or 18 ft. can't remember) with from Georgia to West Virginia through the mountains and used the same truck to dump it in several lakes (including Chemong) for a couple of years.  I was 4.0L, 2WD and I only ever had problem on one ramp that was remote and rarely used.  It was concrete but had a ton of algae and vegetation on it but I made it out after some spinning.  I was running Bridgestone Duelers, which were dogs and I hated them.  I think if you have a 2wd and some BFG AT K/Os which I had on at the end, you would have zero problem."

Toyota will inspect it first and if it the mechanic sees the rust as not being worth repairing, they will give you 150% of the Tacoma in excellent condition for your year. For example, if you currently own a 1997 Taco that's in poor shape and you have the rust issue, they will buy back your Taco for the market value of a 1997 Taco in excellent condition plus 50%. How's that for taking care of your customers? Also, they've extended the rust warranty to fifteen years as well.

349632,craigdritchie,2009-06-08 15:21:00,1586,"I've had four Rangers in my life, and have driven them all over North America without ever having any problems whatsoever. An extended cab model with 4x4, automatic transmission and a 4.0L engine will tow a 20-foot bass boat with no problem whatsoever. I think they're now rated to about 6,000 pounds towing capacity ... you can find the up-to-date info on Ford's website (www.ford.ca).  FX4 is one of several option groups available for 4x4 Rangers. It is not the only 4x4 model.  Ranger is a good truck that's relatively cheap to buy, cheap to insure, and cheap to drive. Costs about $60 - $65 to fill the tank, and on average you get about 500 km to empty. The 4x4 will go through anything, and the 4.0L engine is just about bullet-proof. Last one I had (a black 2005 extended cab 4x4) was the only domestic compact truck recommended by both Consumer Reports and Lemon-Aid (both said it has much better reliability and a lower cost to maintain than anything from GM or Chrysler. I never spend a cent on anything besides oil changes and worn-out tires.)  Spend the extra for 4x4 and upgrade tires - you will appreciate it on slippery ramps or any time it snows.  Likes: Great value for money, fun to drive, fairly easy on gas, never gets stuck, hauls just about anything, comfy seats, keeps its value well.  Dislikes: No heated seats (not even as an option), additional cost for cap or bed lid, extended cab doesn't have the tightest turning radius.  Overall: Reliability equal to Toyota or Nissan, but Ranger is costs less to buy, costs less to insure, and for the most part, Ford has had better financing rates than any of the Japanese automakers (I think my last Ranger was 1.9%, and Toyota was about 5.9% at the time).  No-brainer, to me."
349677,Chris,2009-06-08 17:11:00,405,I believe Ford has 0% financing  for 60mos. on all the Rangers right now. A few months ago it $3500 cash back. They got some good deals going on. Always heard good things about the Rangers. The Mazda's are the exact same truck but are approx. $3000 more.
349678,blue pickeral,2009-06-08 17:11:00,267,-some trouble with the 4.0 L engine - timing chain tensioner/valve train -has not had a significant update in many years -small cab - get the extended cab -reliability? - do an internet search for  Ford/Mazda truck forums and see what common problems are. -may be able to get better deal by going between Ford and Mazda dealers as the B series Mazda is the same truck off the same line. Mazda may have different options available than Ford and vice versa. -would also look into Nissan / Suzuki for similar reasons as Suzuki's new pick up is a re-badged Nissan. -save up for a Toyota

The rough 4.0-liter V6 isn't particularly powerful or efficient. Handling is reluctant, and when unloaded, the rear of the truck can step out on bumpy corners or washboard roads. The ride is stiff and snappy. Stopping distances are long. The narrow cabin is noisy inside and has rudimentary levels of comfort and fit and finish.

It's ungainly and stiff-riding; has a rough and noisy, inefficient engine; and a cramped, uncomfortable cabin. The interior is crudely finished. Compact dimensions and a usefully sized bed are the Ranger's only pluses. Even if you took thousands off its list price, the Ranger still would not be a bargain. This test applies to the virtually identical Mazda B4000 as well. THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE Ride comfort & noise: The ride is harsh and snappy. Common road bumps come through as hard slams and some impacts make the whole structure shake. Jitters and bounces follow you onto the highway. Noise sources abound from the rough engine, tires, and relentless wind.  Handling: The Ranger feels clumsy and requires lots of steering input from the driver when tackling turns. Body lean is not excessive, but the tires are quick to protest. When unloaded, the rear end kicks out easily over washboard roads and potholes. A 45-foot turning circle hampers maneuverability in tight spaces. Though it reached its cornering limits early and managed only a low speed through our avoidance maneuver, the Ranger proved ultimately secure. Electronic stability control could help, and will be standard for the 2010 model. In off-road situations the Ranger does the job, but limited suspension travel compromises traction.  Powertrain: A 207-hp, 4.0-liter V6 engine provides reasonably good performance overall, but its average fuel consumption of 16 mpg overall is not much better than that of much bigger, more powerful pickups. It's too bad that Ford doesn't offer one of the quieter, more modern, and less thirsty V6s it uses on other models. The Ranger was able to tow our 5,000-pound trailer up to 60 mph in 25.5 seconds, a decent performance. The five-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly. The four-wheel drive is a part-time system only.  Braking: Fair overall, with long stops, especially on wet pavement.  Headlights: There is good forward illumination, but the pattern is very spotty and uneven.  INSIDE THE CABIN Driving position: It's difficult to find a good driving position partly because the steering wheel doesn't adjust. Short drivers wanted to sit higher and had trouble reaching the pedals. Leg, knee, and head room are OK, but elbow and shoulder space are tight. The side and rear views are obscured by wide roof pillars, thick head restraints, and small windows.  Seat comfort and access: The Ranger's front seats are very firm, with long, flat cushions and little side support. Seat adjustments are limited to recline and fore/aft positions. A very narrow perch in the center of the front bench gives scant seating for three across. In the rear, the two tiny, center-facing jump seats are barely habitable and best left unused. Most found the running board got in the way more than it helped with access. There are useful grab handles on the inside front roof pillars. Rear reverse-opening doors can open once the front seat occupants remove their seatbelts. But since the two jump seats face inwards, they must be folded away in order to access the center area and then folded out again to seat someone.  Controls and gauges: The gauges are clear enough but pick up reflections and are partly blocked by the steering wheel. Most controls are simple, but the radio lacks a separate tuning knob. The climate system lacks versatility and there's no rear defroster.  Interior fit and finish: Interior features harken back to earlier times. The plastics are mostly hard and cheap-looking. Screw heads are exposed and the door panel flexes when you pull the door shut. The floor has loose plastic matting instead of carpeting.  Cabin storage and cargo room: The Ranger has moderate cabin storage, with a large compartment in the front center seatback armrest and open bins mounted on the center floor. The glove compartment and door pockets are small, and everything is downright no-frills basic. The cargo box is fairly commodious, and with the tailgate down the bed can support loads that are 7.5 feet long.  SAFETY NOTES Safety belts: Front outboard safety belts have pretensioners. The center front position has a lap belt only. The occupant sensing system in the passenger's front seat detects if a small occupant, such as a child, is seated there and will disable the air bag for that position. The rear jump seats have no shoulder belts.  Air bags: Standard driver and passenger front-impact air bags.  Head restraints: Restraints for the outboard front seats are sufficiently tall. Rear and front-center seats lack restraints.  Crash-avoidance systems: Aside from antilock brakes, the Ford Ranger is not equipped with any advanced crash avoidance features.  Driving with kids: Rear-facing seats should never be installed in front. Front-facing seats can be secured in front passenger outboard position as long as the front seats are pushed back as far as possible from the air bag. Front-facing seats were also not secure in the center front position. There are two top-tether anchors at the base of the front passenger and center seats but the Ranger does not have any lower-LATCH anchors. Use of child seats in jump seats not allowed by child-seat manufacturers. There is no safe position for rear-facing seats.  RELIABILITY We expect reliability to be average, according to our latest subscriber survey. Tested model: 2009 Sport extended cab 4WD, 4.0-liter V6, 5-speed automatic Major options: Limited slip, slding rear window, power equipment group."

350141,bassboy,2009-06-09 14:03:00,161,"I have owned 2 rangers.....I had a 1988 XLT with a 2.9 and 5 speed....and I put 320,000 KM on when I sold it, and the guy that bought it off me put another 200,000 plus on it before he got rid of it. No major problems with it other that periodical maintenance and the like.....only thing I would have changed was to get extended cab.  I have a 2006 currently but will get to that after I comment on the following:     The 4.0L engine....at least the one I have is not rough, and not underpowered (208 HP and 235Lb/ft tq) Handling on a truck is quite often reluctant and I have not driven a truck yet that did not want to step out on bumpy corners or washboard when it was unloaded. The brakes are good (but could be better). The cabin is narrow.....but it is a small truck. It is far from noisy inside (it is quieter than the 2001 Malibu my wife used to own), and the comfort of the interior and the fit and finish is far from rudimentary.  I dont have the jump seats so cant comment.  Keep in mind that reviews are VERY subjective...at least in my opinion.....and...what are they comparing it to?? There is no other truck in this class on the market.  There is NO comparison between a Ranger, and any other full sized truck out there...they are two different animals.     First off...Toyota does not make a small truck any more. The Mazda and the Ford are the SAME truck, only differences being cosmetic. All the engines in the Ranger/Mazda trucks are Ford engines (2.3l push rod engine, 3.0l V6 and the 4.0l V6) and the Mazda is not smaller than the Ranger. They come off the same assembly line.  Anyway....not here to start a peeing match.....  My Ranger is a 2006, with XLT level trim 4.0l engine, 5 speed manual, 3.55:1 limited slip rear differential.  The seats are comfortable, the interior is quiet, and there are no rattles or squeaks from the interior components even in the cold (if the fit and finish were crap as stated in the review above I don't believe I could say what I just said about the interior). I have had no problems with it up until now (125,000 km) and don't foresee any in the future.  It pulls my 16ft Tracker superguide with ease. If I were to change anything on it.....I would have gotten 4WD.   The FX4 is not the only 4WD model......however the FX4 package comes with a few extras..I believe steering stabilizer, skid plates and a few other goodies. The Ranger does NOT come with a bunch of options like the F150......so dont expect them.......however....I feel its a great truck for the money.....especially now......there are some good deals on. I can pick up the same truck today as I did almost 4 years ago, but add 4WD for almost  the same price,  financing is 0% over 60 months and they have job loss protection now I believe....in fact had I not gotten laid off and month and a half ago I would have had a new one already. The fuel economy with the 4.0L is about 11L/100km or about 24 MPG TOWING THE BOAT.......not the best but acceptable to me.....as for the 2.3L I am not sure.......but in my mind.....if I am buying a truck to do any sort of work with......a 4 cyl is out of the question.  Anyway.....those are my experiences and opinions and my opinions only.....I hope this helps with your decision and if you want to talk more feel free to send me a PM.   Bill"
350201,Billy Bob,2009-06-09 15:46:00,5865," Bill it's nice to see you are enjoying your Ford Ranger but I have to call you on a few things you said as I quoted them above.  1) You stated the reviews from Consumer Reports is very subjective and that's just the point here. I would have to go with a NON OWNER who does this for a living rather than someone who is trying to convince someone else how good his/her truck is......  2) Toyota indeed makes a small truck it's called the ""Tocoma"" and it's earned the best truck in the small truck class, much unlike the Ranger that rated dead last. At the bottom I included a link for one.........  3) Sorry but I don't believe your Ranger is getting 24 miles to the GALLON towing the boat. That's even more then the EPA rating without towing the boat.  http://www.toyota.com/byt/pub/init.do?zipC...amp;x=0&y=0"

I had a Ranger and it sucked, I have also had 3 Chevy and 2 cost me more than they were worth. If you want the quality and resale value invest in a good truck, not something that will lose 1/2 it's value when you drive it off the lot. Good luck with your purchase either way."
350223,Lunker777,2009-06-09 16:40:00,866,Well thank you all for the input... It really helped me out.  BUT..Last night he had called me gave me a price of $425/mnth over 60 mnths @0% ( I owe alot more on my car than its worth so thats where the higher payment comes into play) He was selling me the truck for $20000  So I asked if A-plan would help the price abit and he said he had to do some figuring and would give me a call back... Called back this morning and says that 0% is now off the truck... so that will make my payment REDICULOUS ! So I dont think I'll be getting a new truck for a while... Ill have to ask the father n'law to borrow his ride !  Thanks again for the help !
350228,Billy Bob,2009-06-09 16:53:00,5865,"Sorry to hear that you were getting ""Jerked"" around by the salesman...........that's what's typically called ""Low Balling"" in the industry. There are many different forms of it but it basically means you are given a low ball price to keep you interested in the vehicle they have and you have shown some interest in. They expect you to get excited about the new car/truck and you have told friends and family you're getting a new ride because of this great deal you're getting. Then at the last minute they left something out of the price or they made a error on the figures, etc.......... then because the customer is so close to getting his new ride he agrees to pay the extra amount just so he can have it.  BTW this might have been a Blessing in disguise after reading the Consumer's Report on the Ford Ranger.   Bob"
350231,Lunker777,2009-06-09 17:04:00,866," I dont think he was low balling me, he knows I used to be in the business and that I know the tricks of the trade hahahah But I know they did have 0% for 60 months yesterday, I saw the paper. HE said they changed it this morning.  Oh well.... I even at the figures he gave me yesterday I wasn't planning on doing anything.... my insurance would go up almost $60 a month... so that right there was the decision maker for me ! Plus I think its a smarter move to drive my car till its paid off... that way I can start fresh and not have deficiency in my new loan !"
