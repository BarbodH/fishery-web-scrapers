But when your having 30 + fish days whats not to love! We spent most of the time jigging for lakers and the action has been steady.working 80fow with tubes and spoons has been the ticket. Lots of fish over 10lbs and a couple pigs. The whities have also been around in the bunches and provide some steady action inbetween lakers. In 4 days on the water we've boated over 150 fish. The fishing is going to be hot for the next couple weeks, if you have the chance get out and take advantage!  Tightlines  Ryan Hare We Pound 'Em Fishing          Her first fish ever              "
