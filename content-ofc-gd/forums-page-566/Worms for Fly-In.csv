559331,danc,2011-03-08 00:45:00,4677," Was that shot taken on a fly in Billy Bob??  We do agree on this issue though. I wouldn't bring any organic bait on a fly in. If you need live bait on a fly in, time to find another location. Besides some frozen ciscoes for off the dock fishing in Red Lake last summer, I haven't used organic bait anywhere in well over a decade."
559332,Billy Bob,2011-03-08 00:48:00,5865," I agree.....my first Fly-In was out of Nakina...a lake they called Aba (short for a hard to say Indian name)..there was 8 of us, one was a outdoor writer who kept count everyday of each boat's catch...at the end of the week we caught 1080 walleyes and 278 pike....  We had no bait with us."
559333,solopaddler,2011-03-08 00:49:00,8605, Depends on the lake really. 90% of the time it's jigs tipped with a piece of worm or crankbaits.
559335,solopaddler,2011-03-08 00:53:00,8605,  Well I'm not going argue the live bait point anymore. Each to their own.  Funny you mention Abamassagi though. Ironically enough I'm bringing my wife and two young kids there for a week in July.  I will be bringing worms.  We'll double your count easy.
559336,Billy Bob,2011-03-08 00:53:00,5865," YES, don't you see the plane big propellers in the back ground...LOL  That was on Erie in front of the old steel plant...I only used it as a example....  When the water is warm and fish are bugging (eating bugs on the bottom) a all black bucktail jig looks like a bug to them. I have probably caught more fish (mostly walleye and smallmouth) than any other bait/lure I have every used.  While crappie fishing I also use jigs (no bait) in white or chartreuse mostly.  Bob"
559339,Billy Bob,2011-03-08 00:58:00,5865," I hope you do....great lake for walleyes and the kids will have a ball...  True story.....the guy I teamed up with in my boat on that trip NEVER casted all week long....he just dropped his jig down to the bottom (7-8') and jigged it along as we drifted the current areas while he drank JD and beer non stop, even in the morning with his coffee.....I would be dead if I drank half of what he did.  Make sure you rest before going, you're going to need it..."
559341,solopaddler,2011-03-08 01:08:00,8605,  It's going to be a fun trip for sure. Aba as you're well aware is a walleye factory.  First trip to a truly outstanding destination for my two little ones. Can't wait to get them onto a pile of fish.  Should be an interesting adventure too. We've booked one of the camps but instead of flying in a local Ojibway is going to take us down the river by boat into the lake.
559342,TennesseeGuy,2011-03-08 01:14:00,957," Bob, join me in May and the two of us will probably match your 8 man catch, without live bait.  Ask JP about May 2005.  Ask Whopper about May 2007, May 2008 & May 2009.  Ask me about May 2004.  And on and on and on.  Jigs and grubs for walleyes.  JSM and Suicks for pike.  I don't count fish.  Measure my success by the ton."
559343,TennesseeGuy,2011-03-08 01:19:00,957, I understand.  Fishing was so good that your beer got warm before you could drink it.  You'll miss Red Lake after retirement.  Get ready for company.  The annual May invasion is coming.
559345,Billy Bob,2011-03-08 01:23:00,5865, I LIKE that line.....  I gave up counting fish years ago....  BTW where are we fishing in May .....
559348,TennesseeGuy,2011-03-08 01:29:00,957,"  Be cautious, I may call your hand.  You'd be a good fishing partner."
559352,Billy Bob,2011-03-08 01:33:00,5865, And we wouldn't have to worry who's bringing the bait...
559354,sneak_e_pete,2011-03-08 01:40:00,540,"Holy replies.  I agree that live bait might not be necessary, but I'm driving 18 hours, spending 2 years savings, and am inaccessible for a week.  If a flat of worms is going to make the difference, I am going to bring them....just in case.  I live in Grimsby and am looking for a shop that will sell in bulk."
559356,TennesseeGuy,2011-03-08 01:42:00,957, Bring a sharp fillet knife.  We'll butcher some walleyes.
559362,solopaddler,2011-03-08 01:55:00,8605," When I lived in Grimsby I bought my worms in bulk from Grimsby Tackle, no problem.  If Grimsby can't help you Bill's Bait and Tackle on Upper James in Hamilton sells worms in bulk too. His prices may actually be better as well.  And you're right to bring them, believe me.  I've done (I think) 33 fly ins over the years as well as countless weeks paddling and fishing northwestern Ontario.  Yes, there's many instances where bait is redundant.  Then again there's been plenty of times where they'll double your catch. No need to take a chance on that for the sake of 30 bucks worth of worms."
559458,Billy Bob,2011-03-08 12:30:00,5865,I have a collection of them....along with many home made bucktail jigs...
559481,Whopper,2011-03-08 13:44:00,2174," LOL May 2009 I tried to keep count and quit after the first two hours of the first day, it was unreal. Grubs weren't even needed   Can't get here soon enough for me, I'll be armed and ready for battle. The fish will probably win"
559499,moose,2011-03-08 14:31:00,266,If in Toronto I know a guy five hundred worms 30$
559504,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-08 14:44:00,2582,Have you researched your area? And when are you going?  I have done 4 Fly-ins out of the Chapleau area...as soon as the ice is off and the season first opens. Worms where pretty much useless in the cold early season water on all four lakes we tried. The eyes wanted minnows. They would outfish worms by a mile.  Just throwing that out there. If it comes down to taking one or the other...make sure you have what's working.
559574,camillj,2011-03-08 18:52:00,1988,Noone says you cant catch fish without live bait ... but ...nuthin catches smallies like a little piece of worm on a single hook with a single split shot .... nothin ... and THAT is why it is illegal on most Bass tourney's  And if a bucktail nails a dozen pickereyes then a bucktail with a little 'viande' nails two dozen ... its just the way it is.
559650,Billy Bob,2011-03-08 23:56:00,5865," The reason minnows out fished worms on you're early fly in trips is because the fish were NOT bugging......and that's because there were no bugs as of yet....come back in a few weeks and things change....early cold water = minnows or minnow type baits......warmer water = bugs, worms or jigs looking like bugs...  I am not saying worms don't work or are not the proper choice for every fishing situation.....on Lake Erie I wouldn't bother to go walleye fishing without worms aboard...but there's a reason for that.....on SMALL lakes trolling and or drifting worm harnesses is NOT necessary but they will still catch fish. However, you're working a LOT harder for said fish IMHO...  Now none of the above is a HARD RULE but more a general rule....there are exceptions to every rule and Lake Erie is a good example.  Bob"
559657,Billy Bob,2011-03-09 00:05:00,5865," Hi camillj,  No disrespect but I have to take some exceptions to your post.  Anytime you care to fish smallies on Lake Erie I will bet lunch you will not out fish me using just a bucktail jig to your single hooked worm.  The reason it's illegal to use live bait or any live bait has more to do with NO LIVE BAIT SPONSORS than any other reason....money talks, live bait walks....  And on your ""viande"" quote.......all I have to say is....you don't fish bucktail jigs."
559217,sneak_e_pete,2011-03-07 20:29:00,540,"Hi there, looking to get some worms for a fly-in.  They need to be in bedding rather than soil and I am looking at bringing around 100-150...any ideas on how to get them/do this?"
559221,solopaddler,2011-03-07 20:38:00,8605,"  I say this in the most facetious way possible.  First,buy the worms, then buy some bedding. Then pack the worms in the bedding and place them in a suitable container."
559230,adempsey,2011-03-07 21:05:00,1498," Lol.  When I went to a fly-in lodge last year I brought in about 120 worms.  To do so I picked up a Frabill Worm Habitat and some worm bedding.  The bedding is basically shredded paper that you add water too [you must squeeze it out so it's just damp, not soaked].  Some people like the Fat & Sassy bedding since you don't need to add water.  I researched a couple of bait shops that were on my route, stopped in and bought some worms [although, I am sure it's cheaper to order a bunch ahead of time].   Removed the worms from the dirt or moss they were in and added them to the container containing the prepared bedding [i prepared my bedding in the hotel we stayed at overnight en route to our fly out location].  Taped up the sides of the box with packing tape and labeled it with my name.  Stored it overnight in the fridge.  Took what I needed for the day each morning and returned what I didn't use at the end of the day.  They were still fat and juicy at the end of my trip.  I still had at least half the worms left at the end of the week and donated them to the lodge.   Returned home with an empty container and half my bedding for next time!"
559232,sneak_e_pete,2011-03-07 21:06:00,540,"Thanks...kinda gathered the general process of buying worms and putting them in bedding.  However, the places I know sell them in soil and they are also quite expensive per dozen...was looking for alternatives."
559234,solopaddler,2011-03-07 21:08:00,8605," Most places will sell a flat of 500, sometimes half a flat.  When I fly in for a week I always bring a flat.."
559235,corvette1,2011-03-07 21:10:00,1765,half a flat last year was 30.00 bucks if your just fishing for eyes you will need more then 100
559242,adempsey,2011-03-07 21:24:00,1498,"Are you in the US or Canada?   If the US you can try here: http://www.vadosbait.com/  Otherwise, just call your outfitter and ask them.  They should know where to order them from."
559253,kickingfrog,2011-03-07 21:56:00,8333,"Your trip, your choice, but is bringing live worms on a fly-in worth it?  I've never been, but I am going this fall.  I just figured with weight restrictions and ""beverage"" requirements that baits in bedding would be something worth not bringing.  Take lots of photos and let us know how it goes."
559259,solopaddler,2011-03-07 22:04:00,8605,  Well I'll assume we'll be fishing together Rob since the other guys are bringing their sons.  There will be worms in my boat.  Even on the most virgin of waters tipping your jig with half a worm will result in waaaay more walleye.
559269,TennesseeGuy,2011-03-07 22:16:00,957,"I recently bought Nightcrawler Secrets, books 1 and 2.  Lots of good information.  All nightcrawlers aren't the same.  Lunkers love nightcrawlers is another good reading source."
559300,kickingfrog,2011-03-07 23:49:00,8333, No issues with that. The weight comes out of your quota.
559302,solopaddler,2011-03-07 23:52:00,8605, Dontcha watch the Cronz? You need a little piece of northern sirloin on that jig son!
559306,Billy Bob,2011-03-07 23:54:00,5865,I have only been on three different fly in's and all I have to say is if you need worms on said fly in you should be choosing another fly in outfitter....  I'll catch as many if not more using black bucktail jigs then someone using worms.
559310,skeeter,2011-03-08 00:01:00,1907,"sneak_e_pete : you need to tell us where you are located, so our help will help."
559311,BillM,2011-03-08 00:05:00,17367, How do those bucktails look on a worm harness?  I'd assume a wee bit funny.
559313,Billy Bob,2011-03-08 00:10:00,5865, You just hook 3 jigs together and toss that thing out there and hang on...LOL...
559316,adempsey,2011-03-08 00:20:00,1498," I am surprised there is actually a book dedicated to Nightcrawlers, let alone three!!!!  I have to check these out."

559323,kickingfrog,2011-03-08 00:30:00,8333," Longer than the gulp worm? or a real worm? I haven't had as much luck with gulp leaches compared to the worms, but I keep using them."
559324,BillM,2011-03-08 00:31:00,17367," Real worm  Although on the few flyins I've been on, you could use rope on a harness and catch fish, lol."
559326,Billy Bob,2011-03-08 00:33:00,5865,Black Bucktail Jigs......no bait of any kind...       #2 son drinking beer and kicking back while the old man does all the work...LOL   White bucktail jigs with no bait of any kind...   ......

I'll guarantee you the walleye fishing out of Folyet doesn't hold a candle to what you'll find north of Nakina.  Anyhow Rob, we can test this out scientific-like next September.  Gulp VS Live Worms  Get ready to ruuumble!  "
