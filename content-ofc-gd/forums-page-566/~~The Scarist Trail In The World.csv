560019,I'mHooked,2011-03-09 20:39:00,525,Wow! all those videos are incredible!  All we need is HD helmet cam video of some extreme angling!
560072,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-09 22:34:00,10439,"  The smart ones were harnessed in, but the guy with the camera and the guy in front of him near the end weren't."
560097,adempsey,2011-03-09 23:56:00,1498,Nobody else noticed that Solo was there too (check at 6:12)? That guy has been everywhere!!
560114,blaque,2011-03-10 00:37:00,2419,That'll get ya puckered up for sure.  Forget the guys walkin it...............Id like to meet the guys that BUILT it
560123,Rod Caster,2011-03-10 00:57:00,5784,  I was thinking the same thing! that's all concrete.  I'd fall and die within three steps.
560194,Cudz,2011-03-10 05:02:00,2652,There were guys on the trail who were harnessed but our guy the camera toting dude was not harnessed.  Insane.
560197,irishfield,2011-03-10 05:09:00,26272,Walkin  a sidewalk in TO was more dangerous than that this evening....
560518,Slop,2011-03-11 02:58:00,151,I've enjoyed all the links so far.  There is nothing like getting high on the job.  http://www.liveleak.com/mp53/player.swf?config=http://www.liveleak.com/mp53/player_config.php?token=07b_1284580365%26embed=1

559635,oldphart,2011-03-08 23:05:00,665,"~~~~check out this site, then go change your pants  http://www.angelfire.com/ak2/intelligencerreport/scariest_path.html"
559636,Governator,2011-03-08 23:07:00,879,woooow.. when he walked on that little beam cause the path is broken is crazy.  Not unless my life depended on it.
559639,d_paluch,2011-03-08 23:35:00,343,absolutely insane! I want to try it!  Anyone else wondering what the fishing's like in the waters below?
559643,BUSTER,2011-03-08 23:45:00,1336,WOW
559644,danbouck,2011-03-08 23:46:00,4380,INSANE!
559645,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-08 23:49:00,10439,"HMMMMM, looks like they may have been neglecting some maintenance on that pathway."
559662,mercman,2011-03-09 00:12:00,7054,OMG......... i couldnt watch the whole thing.I was getting vertigo.Insane for sure.
559673,Joeytier,2011-03-09 00:24:00,3990,The harnesses totally compromise the experience
559674,cranks bait,2011-03-09 00:29:00,721,Now that is cool.  The filmer is definately balsy to not be clipped in and walking all that with a camera.
559695,bucktail,2011-03-09 01:26:00,1857,"Amazing, thanks for sharing that!! Awesome!!!!!"
559698,alexmedic,2011-03-09 01:35:00,186,"Awesome!  Even scarier, check out this downhill race from the same web page!  Chile Race"
559707,Muskieman,2011-03-09 01:43:00,2472,NUTS!!!  Gimme 2 minutes....
559710,BUSTER,2011-03-09 01:45:00,1336,Holy snikies
559716,Nipfisher,2011-03-09 01:57:00,2449, My training wheels would never hold up on the stairs.
559732,cranks bait,2011-03-09 02:42:00,721,"  No Way, that is sweet.  I loved that vid.  I would do both the trail and the bike, but the bike has me jazzed, common spring!!!!"
559734,splashhopper,2011-03-09 02:52:00,2931,woah... i still feel queezie
559740,ranksda58,2011-03-09 03:00:00,69,"never, ever, everevereverever would i even consider that...those guys have some giant cahones"
559759,Dara,2011-03-09 03:35:00,3052,"Its all in what you're used to, and I'm going to have bad dreams tonight"
559794,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-09 05:32:00,10439,Or maybe a nice scenic trail ride on your dirt bike.  Scenic Trail Ride
559799,Live2fish85,2011-03-09 07:10:00,1633,LOL wow that's crazy I would like to do that just for the view some of those mountain faces were amazing.
559862,smally21,2011-03-09 14:24:00,993,the dog in the bike race also has some nerve
559869,Governator,2011-03-09 14:43:00,879,"The bike one is really cool too, although a fall there might be a broken arm/ribs some bruises (or nothing at all).  The fact that if you slip walking across a 4"" beam hundreds of feet in the air just to take in some cool views freaks me out more for sure.  If the bridge crumbles or you slip you die lol"
559908,ranksda58,2011-03-09 16:52:00,69,"it looked like they were harnessed in...at one point i saw i guy with a harness clip off that cable that runs along the mountain wall but either way, like i said, never ever ever......."
559912,Live2fish85,2011-03-09 17:06:00,1633,Yea the bike video is neat but really it's no worst then doing downhill biking through the forest. But it is still a great video and a decent run that they have there.
559927,Pikeslayer,2011-03-09 17:33:00,1443, Same thing here Paul. I had to turn it off half way through. I'll watch the rest when I'm safe in bed.
