559576,lew,2011-03-08 19:04:00,12766,"Spotted this little gem popping up in my front garden today, so maybe it's a sign that winter is finally on the way out.  Course, there's still the 6"" of snow that the weather dood is calling for late tomorrow afternoon.  "
559578,Roy,2011-03-08 19:16:00,13728,"A sure sign of spring, Lew. My flower beds still have at least 3 feet of snow on them so it'll be sometime in April before I see a crocus working its way out of the earth. Thanks for the breath of spring."
559580,bubbles,2011-03-08 19:19:00,591,It can't come soon enough.  I just went for a ride down to the river to have a look and see how much ice is flowing.  My guess is 2 more weeks and there will be boats out there pulling in them eyes!  I can't wait.
559581,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-08 19:20:00,2582,I went to the garden center Saturday and got my onion sets and seed potatoes. Bring it on I say.  Thx for sharing the pic Lew

559591,OhioFisherman,2011-03-08 20:02:00,6623,"Snow is almost gone here again, that will probably change in a day or two, it`s still March, but Muskies are in season."
559605,bigbuck,2011-03-08 20:57:00,2449,"I HOPE I HOPE I HOPE!!! I'm getting tired of this winter, it's been cold and long. A few more weeks till pike opens on GBay. Time to start getting my gear ready."
559687,danc,2011-03-09 01:01:00,4677,It was a very mild -28F when I started work this morning. A lot nicer than yesterdays -33F though. Yes Lew. I can almost smell the flowers now.
559689,jjcanoe,2011-03-09 01:06:00,744,"check out your neighbourhood home depot, I've been delivering loads of mulch and topsoil by the trailer load for almost a month now!"
559803,lew,2011-03-09 09:24:00,12766,Was in Home Depot yesterday and all the snowblowers & shovels are gone and are replaced with riding mowers & rakes.  But we've  gotta get thru the nastiness the weather dood is still calling for later to-day
559807,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-09 10:13:00,1107,I sure hope so Lew I'm so sick of winter
559861,Billy Bob,2011-03-09 14:15:00,5865,I'm wishing I was fishing but it looks more like the beginning of Feb then March here. Snow is falling as I type.....Grrrrrrrrrrr
