560094,ADB,2011-03-09 23:42:00,444,"For those interested, I found out from someone I know from when I used to work there that Le Baron will now carry both Live Target and Gary Yamamoto worms.  Most Live Targets are $11.76 and the Yamamotos are $7.63.  I was pretty surprised as they always resist change at that place."
560096,adempsey,2011-03-09 23:53:00,1498,Good to know.  They really needed to expand their plastics section [not to mention some other areas].  Especially at the Markham location.    Hopefully they will get some of the grubs too.
560099,ah_long,2011-03-10 00:03:00,354,"finally, it's about time.. They really need to stock up their Markham location... they run out of the good colors/sizes all the time.. Mississauga is much better in terms of selection, if only it's closer"

560161,Gregoire,2011-03-10 02:32:00,1397,I am shocked at how poor their selection is. I have no idea why they do not carry st. croix rods. I was at gagnon's the other day and the rod selections was much better.

I like to pick them up and let them sparkle in my hand before I buy them. The last thing I wanna do is stare at them through a glass case."
