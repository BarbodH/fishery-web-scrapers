I have never been there..I guess they have booked with an outfitter. First are there any locals that giv me ice conditions? I realy dont want to drive all that way to find out were out of luck. Secondly, what can I expect to catch and what gear do you all recomend I bring? I know so many questions but I honestly hoping to have one last kick at the cat before hard water goes away!!! Thanks in advance folks!!"
559602,adempsey,2011-03-08 20:51:00,1498, I was thinking about heading up there myself toward the end of the month.  You could call one of the outfitters on the lake to get a price quote and some other information:  Lake Bernard Bait & Outfitters - 705-384-7948 Carter's Charters - 705-752-0758 All Seasons Fishing Guide - 705-386-7562

It's usually a good one for the kids. The fishing can be good. If you have a rental I may know one of the guys who runs it. Message me if you need info."
