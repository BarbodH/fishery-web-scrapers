558164,Rod Caster,2011-03-05 00:11:00,5784,"Jim Jigger and I went on a day trip a couple weeks ago looking for monster lakers. He was going to post this but, hahahaha, kept hitting the backspace button when we wasn't in the ""editor"" mode and quit trying.  I mapped out some lakes off of Red Squirrel road, studies depths and had some 7-10"" frozen and salted chub ready as ammo. The plan semed flawless, except for one thing: Red Squirrel road never quite melted and my truck is useless in deep snow. After playing the drums on my dashboard a few times, we turned around and decided to take the ice road on Lake Temagami and look for fish, blindly. I used my rod and auger as a depth finder...I must have drilled 50 holes that day looking for shoals and depth changes. Jim Jigger pulled in two decent size lakers and missed another at the hole. I, unfortunately come home with nothing but a sore auger shoulder.  We had some misfortune, but overall it was a fantastic trip and a good learning experience on Temagami.              Enjoy"
558175,irishfield,2011-03-05 00:42:00,26272,Great adventure RC !! You threw those big Chubs in the ditch at Red Squirrel.. correct?
558193,Rod Caster,2011-03-05 01:05:00,5784,  Actually they are sitting somewhere near the L.Tem Access road. haha.
558201,irishfield,2011-03-05 01:19:00,26272,I figured you were a responsible lad !! Only lake in 11 that they left the 5.1 inch bait restriction on.. dead or alive.  Not that it stops people..  
558205,Rod Caster,2011-03-05 01:25:00,5784,"i've had those things frozen for over 5 months... I was upset at wasting them, but that's the way it goes.  It's quite the unique reg, I'm not sure I understand it. Are they trying to reduce the opportunity to catch bigger fish? Are they trying to keep suckers out of the lake?"
558206,irishfield,2011-03-05 01:26:00,26272,No.. they are dictating catch and release in a devious way ! They tried the same Reg in the Ottawa and public out cry made them retract it. Nobody screamed loud enough in Zone 11.
558549,johnnyb,2011-03-05 22:53:00,3413,"Now there's no law against using two minnows at the same time, right?  So what if I had two 5""minnows pinned together nose to tail (I'm thinking deadbait here)....that would be within the letter of the law, no?"
558553,irishfield,2011-03-05 23:01:00,26272,"Guess said bait would be longer than 5.1 "" John. Their (MNR) claim was those fishing with bait bigger than 5.1"" are using rigs that end up deep hooking their catch and it's DOA. So what if you're fising within the regs and only keeping your 2 lakers/day."
558611,Rod Caster,2011-03-06 01:27:00,5784,"  ah yes, the old 6 hook suprise.  I'm quite sure that if you had a smaller bait that the chances of a deep hook become greater, since the fish could swallow it easier. Not that it matters for me, I couldn't catch fish on temagami if my bait was a 5 inch stick of TNT"
559584,johnnyb,2011-03-08 19:28:00,3413,"Would be nice if they would simply outlaw gorge hooks, which (I think) is the method they believe is causing the deep hooking.  "
