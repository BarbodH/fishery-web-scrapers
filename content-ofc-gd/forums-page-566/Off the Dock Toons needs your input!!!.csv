560027,Harrison,2011-03-09 20:52:00,2202,"Hi all, hope you are enjoying the our toons here on OFC.  We have permission from the powers that be to post this survey.  Myself and Maureen from Off the Dock Toons are in the process of creating an animated short pilot of our toons for TV.  We have put together a small survey posted on our site. We were hoping we could recruit a few OFC folks to take a second and fill it out for us.  There are some great things are happening with OTD in the short time since creation. However, we are very interested in collecting your input so we have all the ammunition we can when we are presenting this.  Help us get a fun fishing cartoon on the air!  Thank you in advance for your time.  Phil and Maureen Creators ""Off the Dock"" Toons"
