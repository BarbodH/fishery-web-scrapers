559171,bigbuck,2011-03-07 18:29:00,2449,"Having been a Financial Advisor and Insurance Advisor for the past 14 years having seen Asian flu, the collapse of LTC, the Tech bubble and resultant Rubble, 9/11, the banking system locking up in '07 and the subsequent implosion in '08, I can still say that had you invested CONSERVATIVELY in Canada, you'd be doing fine. The problem with most people is that they jump into the market when everyone is making money and sell when they lose. I have clients who make A LOT of money who stress out about how they can make their RRSP contribution, never mind a TFSA contribution. Too many people are living beyond their means using credit cards and suck the equity out of their houses thru lines of credit. Stick to living off 90% of what you make and invest 10% for the long term. YOU WILL retire comfortably if you start that when you are young. Remember in the market, ""Pigs get slaughtered"". If you are greedy, you'll get killed sooner or later. GICs are good for keeping a few grand around for incidental expenses and short term savings. Times are a lot different from when our parents and grandparents grew up with very little. There are too many ways out there to suck cash out of your pocket, cell phones, internet access, digital/satellite HD tv, leasing (as opposed to buying expensive cars), big houses, etc...etc....etc... Do you NEED all of this stuff?? I still have 3 tube tvs in the house, the newest is 8years old, the other two are 17 years old, basic cable, a basic high speed internet connection, cheap cell phone deal for my wife 9(mine is expensive but I need it for work), decent home with a very small mortgage and 2 8 year old vehicles on the driveway. We eat very well but that is because I shop for specials. I deal with these issues on a daily basis and most people don't get it until I get them to start journalling their daily expenses to see where their money leaks out. $10/day at Starbucks is ridiculous, get a couple of medium Timmies for $3 or drink the free coffee at the office or here is a novel idea, bring a thermos from home (I do when I'm on the road seeing clients). No shame in brownbagging folks!!! Bring a lunch from home whether it's leftovers or a sandwich. TREAT yourself to a lunch out ONCE a week, not every single day. I can go on and on and on. Conclusion: Be smart with what you earn, live within your means and you will be fine."
559199,bigugli,2011-03-07 19:42:00,6138,"Hey Bigbuck, you said the pigs/greedy, get slaughtered. You are quite right. In my case, the pigs were the investment advisors. I fed them my savings and the ""conservative"" funds they put them in got slaughtered. The one pension fund has not paid out to a single pensioner in 3 years. Seems it had lost 90% of its previous value. It might start paying off after half of the contributors have died. I'll trust the mob before I ever trust a banker or financial advisor again."

558654,Old Man,2011-03-06 03:22:00,822,"Some rules of investing:  1) Start early, time is your friend. Compounding is wonderful. 2) Invest on a regular basis. 3) Spread it around. Get a nice mix of equity based and debt based investments. 4) Understand what you are investing in and the risks. Understand yourself and the risk level you're comfortable with. 5) Educate yourself. Don't rely on a ""investment advisor"" (basically they are salesmen) 6) Invest for the long term. Don't jerk your money from here to there trying to catch the next big wave. Review and tweak your portfolio once or twice a year. 7) Know and understand the tax implications of each investment and plan for them."

This is the second time I put over $100.00 in, the first was Katrina . . . 	when I heard they might run outta $1.35 gas, I filled up, but within days it bottomed out, back to $.89.9. THIS time it ain't gonna bottom out . . . .   there's talk we could see it at $1.50+ by summer!  In March of 2008 my car insurance was about $1100.00, in 2009 it went to $1450.00 . . .   .   last year it jumped to $1980.00 so I went from Economical to RBC at $1710.00. This year RBC has now cranked it up to $2100.00, and to add insult to injury I now have about half the coverage!! I nearly wore out my dialing finger . . . .  it's like they all are reading from the same script . . . . .   RBC at $2114.00 is the cheapest. But they have ANOTHER l'il scam going . . .   if you take your home insurance with the car insurance, they will discount the car insurance so you get the home insurance FREE?? I suspect if you do that, they will crank the home insurance way y y y up next year, and since you chose the 'package,' you now MUST keep it?  And while I got a good rant going, just wait till the other member of that unholy trio (the banks, of course) starts crankin' up interest rates! I generally save my pennies all year, then take a short-term loan from my line-of-credit, to chuck into an RRSP which I pay back when I get my tax refund. The nerve these guys got . . . 	I put my money in a GIC for a year . . . .    1.25% interest . . . . 	but I have to borrow some back, temporarily . . . . 	at 5.25% . . . .  now if that ain't legal robbery, w'ot'in'ell is?  So o o o  .  .  .    those of you with a house & mortgage, who have a fixed income or salary . . .   1 or 2 cars to insure, that might be gas guzzlers and kids to support . . . .  what are YOU gonna do? I'd like to hear what you plan on doing this summer . . . .   staying home? I'm lucky . . . .   I don't owe a nickle and am on my own, and my l'il Montana van isn't really bad on fuel . . .  but when a round trip up to the Kawarthas starts costin' $60.00 I'll be doin' my fishin' a lot closer to home. I can just imagine what it'll cost to drag a boat & trailer with a 4X4, then fill up the truck AND boat for a nice  leisurely day on the lake . . . 	O W W W W  I   T   C    H! Ah h h h . . . .

I kinda share the same opinion as Roy...I guess I'm just numb from it now...they have wore me down to the point of not even registering concern as they bend me over.  However I really am concerned about the future for my kids sometimes.  I truly believe they are the first generation in my life time that are going to be worse off then the previous generations.  It had to happen sometime. It is just unfortunate that most of the generation has never been taught how to be frugal...was never a need in the recent ages of plenty...so they are like lambs to the slaughter.

558294,Big Cliff,2011-03-05 12:51:00,6899,"Steve Steve Steve; Man you just have to get out fishing before it's too late LOL!  I do agree with you though, everytime you turn around someone up there is trying to take something from you. Our taxes keep going up and there isn't anything we can do about it. As CPH puts it, ""bend over"".  You can keep cutting back and pinching pennies all you want, the better you get at doing that the less revnue our government and institutions are going to get so they will just raise taxes higher to off set it.  What are you trying to save up for anyway, your golden years? By the time you get enough saved up to enjoy them, you'll be to old to do anything. Oh well, your kids will have fun with the money some day.  I am at that point where I'm tired of working most of my life to support some politician gets more time off than the school kids do and I pay them about 3 times my annual wages to do it.  The solution is simple, quit working, spend your time fishing or whatever you enjoy doing. Spend your money, go in debt to the hilt if you have to. When you aren't working anymore and all your money is gone, you will qualify for welfare. All the money you borrowed to buy new fishing gear and stuff; well now you claim bankruptsy, since you don't have a job or any resourses, you don't have to repay it.  You'll get free health care, drugs, glasses, dental, and you'll get enough money to buy food, pay rent and utilities and have plenty of time to go fishing! Isn't that what you have been trying to accomplish anyway? Oh, and move to the Kawarthas and rent a nice small house now so that when you are out of money welfare will end up paying the rent and utilities for you.... Then you don't need to spend a lot of money on gas to go fishing anymore!!!!"

A lot of this is spawned by the same greedy oil speculators that drove the economy down not long ago---and no secret---every item somehow is tied to oil----heat---food transport---manufacturing..fishing....and so on.  Now a small percentage of fat cats don't care---they're making the bucks---they just pay.  It's our shrinking middle class that now will hold their dollars closer because the squeeze is on---Bills have to be paid now with HST---We are forced to hold on to $$$---not buying hurts the economy...We're right back where we started.  Heaven forbid anyone thinks of the people that are barely getting by----what do they have to go without now? It will be harder for the middle class to give more to help---they're being stretched also and left with less dispoable income to help.

Watching a gas hike of 20% over a year, and the subsequent price hikes on everything else, there are consequences. Scrimping and saving are the order of the day. Meat only gets bought, in bulk, if it's on for cheap. I have a set limit on my gas allowance unless I make extra. Slobby's and the Stupidstore are not in my budget. I have taken the lessons learnt by my grandparents, through war and depression, to heart. We waste too much time and effort on frivolous ""I wants"", and don't focus enough on needs. We don't need a TV plus accessories in every room. Can't justify $500 on a rod and reel. I've been quite creative in finding extra money the past couple of years. Despite my disabilities I refuse to give up, surrender, and lock myself in my room. There aren't too many options Pension funds and RSP's aren't that secure. Funds fail, go bankrupt. At the flip of a switch, governments can change the rules and start taxing the RSP's. They already did that on some money funds a few years back. The food banks and benevolent funds can't keep up in most cities. Churches are, once again, opening soup kitchens. There are a lot of people without heat and hydro, again, this winter. That is the lot in life for a number of low income and fixed income families."

""The secret to money is to make it work for you"" This statement was passed on to me by a little old man one day. Over the years by trial and error I have been able to find some of the ways he eluded too. Most times if you take the time to talk to your bank rep. you will find that certain accounts can yield more interest than others. You can also find that those accounts can be raised to a preferred rate just by asking. The banks also have starter accounts that will pay up to 3% which you can have an automatically drawn from another account. While it is limited to about 1200.00 a year it is a start. This all sounds good but if you have debt then all of the % the bank can give you will not offset the % you are paying them. Focus on the largest debt % first and work hard to pay off one of the debt cards you have. After it is paid off go down the line and pay them all off. If you have a car payment nows the time to work on this one if it is a higher percent than than your mortgage. Now you have gotten to the point were the only debt you have is the house. Support your 401 or SEP to its maximum amount and then pay down your mortgage as fast as you can.  So were is all of this extra money you have? It's in your pocket and leaking out because you don't have a budget. Sit down and write a budget and stick to it. You would be amazed at how you spend your money keep a log for a week and you will see holes all over the place. If you want a good book to read Dave Ramsey he has programs that will give you the support and the reasons on how to get out of debt. He is not a debt consolidation service he is a guy that gives you the tools needed to fix your money issues with hard work and will power all for the price of the book.   Art"

I noticed everywhere I shop the prices are going up very quickly.  Salaries definitely are not going up that fast....if at all.   I've seen more lay offs, forced time off and pay cuts than anything else.  Those Fat Cats have been sitting quietly in the corner waiting for things to seem like they were improving to jump out and start clawing at our money again.   I think that's now.   I don't see how this is sustainable.  Are we just going to end up working to live?  Some won't even be lucky enough to do that.   IMO that's where most of the middle class is headed if things don't change."
558428,Fisherman,2011-03-05 17:29:00,7201,"I think one of the most important rules that you can live buy was mentioned above, the WANT vs. NEED rule.  I'm not talking about basic life items, but the more frivalous things that you believe you can't live without, 3 TV's, the complete line up of cable or satellite service,  dining out far too often, go to the movies, and oh ya, that ""special"" rod and reel that is supposed to catch more fish.  A mega sized house complete with the mega electric and gas bill, the 3 cell phones and all the different iPods/iPads.  Do ya really need the $XXXX sized fish finder or will the $xxx one work.  Another thing that a lot of people don't do anymore is live with a hard and fast budget.  My wife puts away the money to run our daily bills, house taxes, ins, hydro, heat, cable/phone/internet, groceries, etc in one account.  There's NO DIPPING allowed.  Leftovers at the end of the month are placed in another rainy day account for bigger ticket items like washer/dryer/fridge.   If the money isn't there, it sure doesn't get spent ahead of of time.  One of the biggest things that should scare a lot of people is their personal debt load, last study shows it's about 150%, for those who don't know what that means, people are spending $150 dollars for every $100 they earn.  DUH.  Anyway, just an opinion."
558496,irishfield,2011-03-05 20:29:00,26272,"  Sorry DSN, your rights?? What about the rights of the people you owed money to?? Sad you haven't the dignity to worry about someone else feeding their family, just as long as you can clear your debt and carry on.  And Steve.. YOU control your money. Don't lose sight of that and you'll be just fine!"
558500,Billy Bob,2011-03-05 20:48:00,5865,"Actually when you come down to it we don't need half of the crap we have.....cell phones, big screen TV's, Cable or Satellite, computers, internet service and MANY more things we did without until recently....  My mother always said ""watch your pennies and your dollars will take care of themselves""...."
558565,bigugli,2011-03-05 23:51:00,6138,"My mother thought she had enough, according to all the bankers and advisors. Then came the collapse in  I.T. stocks and she lost 20%. Then they changed the rules and started taxing ""safe funds"" and she lost 10% more. The recession, so far, has cost her close to 15% of her fund values. One heck of a beating in just over 10 years. So much for being comfortable, eh?"
558582,hammercarp,2011-03-06 00:43:00,964,"My answer to your question is, ""Not You"" at least not the value of your money. This inflation is the result of the financial crisis that nearly sank the worlds economy. When I started a post about the crooks that did this ( Inside Job )  there was not a bit of interest on this forum. The guys that caused this and future financial troubles yet to come class all got bonuses again in 2010. They could not give a crap about the price of gas, heating oil, insurance and the like."
