560041,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-09 21:17:00,2690,"I still think the thing that many are missing on this hit, is the fact that Chara saw the opportunity to take this guy out.  His head was up, he knew where ""patches"" was going to hit...he didn't hit him too hard, or in the head, but he made the conscious decision to put the guy into the stanchion.  To me, this is intent to injure...and if Chara played for my team, I would still believe this."
560044,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-09 21:37:00,2582,"Not often I agree with the NHL's decisions on such matters, but I feel they made the correct one on this one.  It is hockey not RINGETTE.  The only thing I will say is I feel Chara knew 100% what he was doing. He saw the opportunity to bang up his opponent and he took it. Hockey is a rough game played by rough men.  I however don't think in a million years he would want to end someone's career. He is a tough physical player/but not a goon, and the league recognized that in there decision."
560047,jedimaster,2011-03-09 21:39:00,3472,"The reality is he rode him out of the play in a dirty interference hit. He got a penalty and a game misconduct. Thats about what is to be expected from that hit. If it was on the other side of the rink I doub't he would have even got a penalty. Its very unfortunate he got hurt, but I don't think the league can go and hand out suspensions for Interence plays. It was dirty yes, but he got the penatly for the late hit. It wasn't a suspendable hit. But the result was very very unfortunate. I am sure the March 24th game in Mtl will be a blood bath for sure. I wouldn't be surprised if chara is a healthy scratch."
560048,Peps,2011-03-09 21:40:00,191,"I agree with what said a few post ago, if you played hockey or even know the game a little........Chara knew exactly what he was doing"
560056,solopaddler,2011-03-09 21:51:00,8605," I would agree with that IF the Montreal player was standing still. He wasn't and neither was Chara.  Fact is he was trying to blow by Chara along the boards and Chara reacted at high speed by trying to angle him into the boards.  The entire episode was played out at high speed.  All you guys claiming foul who supposedly have played the game and know it inside out, well you're wrong."
560057,Radnine,2011-03-09 21:53:00,1538,"I have not read the whole thread guys so forgive me if someone has brought this up, but why is there a stanchion to be hit into? Nets were put on pegs because of injuries to players running into (or checked into) them, why not a break-away stanchion (or something that eliminates the opportunity)? Jim"
560059,tb4me,2011-03-09 21:55:00,3295,"All i have to say is that was a clean hit. If anything that useless section of glass shouldn't even be there..its only there to protect the useless commentator like Healy or Maguire. I say loose the glass shove the bums up in the press box where they belong and this never happened. Just imagine how poor Chara feels after breaking a guys neck. As for the habs fans, bring on the cheese to go with the wine. As for Max Pacioretty I hope for a speedy recovery. Good clean hit and a good call by the league..For once the NHL made the right decision"
560061,misfish,2011-03-09 22:01:00,29133,"  I dont be thinking so.They (montreal) can bring who ever they want to make the pay back.Anyone goes after Chara,thier in the box. It happens all the time.       As for the hit, IMO, he rode the guy to the boards like many do. Just happen that that STANCHION got in the way.Dosent mean it was intent.  Too bad it wasnt Avery.  Now theres a guy that needs a STANCHION.    Anyone ever watch Stevens hits?"
560062,wallyboss,2011-03-09 22:05:00,1095,Nobody can say that Chara didn't use his hands to push Pac's head in the stanchion. Check the picture on that link.  http://www.ottawacitizen.com/sports/index.html
560065,Governator,2011-03-09 22:16:00,879,"  Look more closely, he's hitting the numbers on Max's shoulder, it's not a headshot.  It's just the angle that makes it appear that way."
560067,solopaddler,2011-03-09 22:21:00,8605,Isn't it amazing how much passion hockey inspires? It truly is a part of the fabric of our culture. Whether we agree or disagree it's a glue that helps bind our nation together.
560068,jediangler,2011-03-09 22:26:00,1923,Who are the habs gonna send after Chara next game? If they call up another guy like White the league will not let him play and fine the Habs. If they're gonna poke the big man they better bring more ambulances than they usually do. Only Hall Gill is close to his weight class but he wouldn't stand a chance against Lucic let alone Chara. Maybe Habs fans will get the picture when they remove that stretch of glass from the Bell Centre.
560069,Cudz,2011-03-09 22:27:00,2652,Exactly.  If you watch it on slow mo you might think it is on purpose but the game is not played at that speed.  Chara might have given him an extra little shove but there is no way he could have planned that.  At the speed they were going no chance.  It was unfortunate but not intentional.
560077,ehg,2011-03-09 22:42:00,2666," Born in Montreal and raised as a Hab fan here but i don't think Chara was making an effort to injure.  Wow, are people ever getting riled up here."
560078,Roy,2011-03-09 22:43:00,13728,"I think you've covered every angle of this most recent, wonderful moment in this great sport."
559951,spooner_jr,2011-03-09 18:16:00,193,The other tell is Chara's reaction...none.  If he didn't realize what he was doing I think he would have had more of a what the hell look on his face.
559956,solopaddler,2011-03-09 18:26:00,8605,"None of the talking heads on any of the sports networks believe there was an intent to injure.  I feel terrible for the kid though, tough break."
559974,kickingfrog,2011-03-09 18:59:00,8333, Might get awful quiet.

559979,Governator,2011-03-09 19:17:00,879,"This is really hard to judge...  I know almost any Chara hit I've seen looks the same with the left shoulder/arm shoving guys.  That's essentially how he hits. It doesn't justify smoking a guy in to the turnbuckle but it makes me think he didn't intend to injure him, it's how he naturally throws guys in to the boards.  I sure hope it wasn't intentional, I can't imagine too many guys thinking ""I'd love to smoke this guys head right in to the post and break his neck""...  As for Max, I just hope he can make a recovery and end up back in the NHL.  He'll probably never play the same again sadly."
559993,bubbles,2011-03-09 19:42:00,591,"If you have ever played you know as well as I do that he knew EXACTLY what he was doing.  He should be out for as long as Max is, plus tax."
559997,corvette1,2011-03-09 19:55:00,1765,so lets not hit anymore play allstar hockey 12-11 games

560005,lakerguy,2011-03-09 20:24:00,224,  Agreed 100%  He did push....nothing clean about it.
560007,Governator,2011-03-09 20:31:00,879,"There will be no suspension:    Statement from NHL Sr. V.P. of Hockey Operations Mike Murphy on Chara hit Wednesday, 03.09.2011 / 3:25 PM / News NHL.com  Share  TORONTO â€“ National Hockey League Senior Vice President of Hockey Operations Mike Murphy today issued the following statement on Boston Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara's hit in NHL game #996 last night against the Montreal Canadiens:  ""I conducted a hearing with Boston Bruins' defenseman Zdeno Chara with respect to the major penalty for interference and game misconduct that he was assessed at 19:44 of the second period for a hit on Max Pacioretty of the Montreal Canadiens.  ""After a thorough review of the video I can find no basis to impose supplemental discipline. This hit resulted from a play that evolved and then happened very quickly -- with both players skating in the same direction and with Chara attempting to angle his opponent into the boards. I could not find any evidence to suggest that, beyond this being a correct call for interference, that Chara targeted the head of his opponent, left his feet or delivered the check in any other manner that could be deemed to be dangerous.  ""This was a hockey play that resulted in an injury because of the player colliding with the stanchion and then the ice surface. In reviewing this play, I also took into consideration that Chara has not been involved in a supplemental discipline incident during his 13-year NHL career."""
560009,jedimaster,2011-03-09 20:32:00,3472,"I don't think he is gonna get a big suspension. In fact he may not even get one at all. The media have already dismissed this as a normal run of the mill rub you out of the play and finish your check with a very unfortunate ending. Yah he rubbed him out, yah he probably rubbed him out into the turnbuckle on purpose but its been done a billion times before and never been suspendable. I doubt he will get anything more than a 5 game suspension. My guess is he will not even get a suspension."
560010,GBW,2011-03-09 20:32:00,8460,and no fine or suspension either.  just announced.
560013,glen,2011-03-09 20:34:00,2641,Chara needs to get his on the ice.
560015,jedimaster,2011-03-09 20:37:00,3472,"Well there it is decision has been handed down, no suspension for the hit."
560016,Leecher,2011-03-09 20:37:00,7832,I'm blown away whith the leagues decision
560018,GBW,2011-03-09 20:39:00,8460,Oh well.  Someone will try and get him.  And on that note I'm done with this one...
560021,Headhunter,2011-03-09 20:40:00,5703,"Good luck finding volunteers to take on that task... the man is not only huge, powerful and possessing a bit of a mean streak, he also practices Olympic style wrestling in the off season with his Czeck buddies... anyone remember the McCabe incident? HH"
560024,misfish,2011-03-09 20:47:00,29133,"  LOL Just like my grand daughter whiping around her drag doll. That was halarious.McCabe would go down,Chara lifted him back up to deliever more punishment."
560025,solopaddler,2011-03-09 20:50:00,8605,Not unexpectedly the league made the correct decision.
560026,Grimace,2011-03-09 20:50:00,2020,The league is inviting a goat show for the next game.  They love this.
560028,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-09 20:56:00,0,"like i said, the only people that think it's dirty are habs fans...  league officials included."
560033,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-09 21:05:00,2690," Actually I am far from a Habs fan, but, I still think it was dirty, and, that he knew exactly what was going to happen.  Oh, well...the decision has been made. Makes me laugh when I see the 10 game suspension that was handed out last week for a hit that was 1/10 as vicious.  Chara has been walking a fine line lately, his will come..."

559853,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 13:53:00,4399,  When we go on our trip in September we are going to have to agree to no hockey talk!
559855,rickster,2011-03-09 13:55:00,495, i am sure as an unbiased fan that if you think the chara hit was dirty than you must agree that the patches hit on eaton was dirty as well as was the kostopoulos hit on stuart or kostopoulos on van ryn   ahhhh habs fans...must be nice to live life with blinders on  almost as bad as leaf fans  ya the hit looks bad (maybe even dirty) in slow motion  but remember the game IS NOT played in slow motion  hope patches in ok
559857,corvette1,2011-03-09 14:07:00,1765,clean hit he is so big any hit hurts if the stanion was not there just a hit into the boards any one who has played the game was tought finish your check hope pacioretty is ok
559859,bigugli,2011-03-09 14:12:00,6138,"Ever since Philadelphia started their goon squad, the game has gradually spiralled downward. I remember only too well the stitches, black eyes and missing teeth. I've had all of them playing hockey. Played goal before masks were mandatory ( masks were for sissies) and got a concussion for my efforts. That happens when you play the game. If you played a dirty game you got benched for 2 reasons: a) for playing dirty,  to avoid a grudge game. Repeat the mistakes and you were off the team."
559864,perchslayer666,2011-03-09 14:29:00,280,"Wow, are people blind here??? Chara pushes the guy right into the turnbuckle... It's clear as day... Watch it again and tell me that Chara didn't push ""Patches""...   Let's get something straight, I'm 100% against the ""Panzification"" of the game, but this was a dirty, malicious move by Chara, and he should be suspended and fined large. Chara's lucky he didn't kill him."
559866,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-09 14:35:00,2690," I totally agree, he was looking right where he was going...total intent to injure...how is it clean when he knows what the outcome will be.  I love hitting, but come on, anybody that thinks this was clean...watch it again."
559880,Grimace,2011-03-09 15:05:00,2020,Fan 590 just reported that Pacciorety (sp?) has a severe concussion and neck damage.  That is a big loss for the Habs.  He has 14 10 24 points in 37 games so that is a 30 goal scorer over a full season.  I am no habs fan.  But that is tough.
559888,JohnF,2011-03-09 15:43:00,3494,"There are checks and there are checks. Not all of them involve body contact. Looked to me like Chara had finished the check when he put the puck behind Pac-whatever. (note - Mea culpa. I just saw a different vid and the puck was fired down into the Boston end not back, so Chara was in fact doing his job by taking out the offensive player, albeit late and away from the puck but that's nothing new in hockey. The rest of the para is clipped because it was all based on a mistaken assumption.) The rest still applies though.  Sure it was bad luck that the Habs player got hurt because I don't think Chara meant to injure him. These guys are all well aware of what that can mean, particularly now that the cases are starting to go to court. I think Chara did mean though to hurt him as much as he possibly could. There's a big difference there.  I know it's not Chara's fault he towers over most other players but is it remotely possible that he and the other oversized guys have a little extra responsibility to tone it down when they have such an obvious size advantage? I've seen a few hits from him this year that as far as I'm concerned are close to taking him into the Pronger school of bullying. I see nothing to respect there. It's a shame he can't just accept the credit he gets for being a solid defenceman without being a bully to boot but that seems to be what the fans want today. I think it's (almost) incredible that a guy that big can still be as relatively nimble as Chara is, as a skater and a puck handler. Sure there's lots of guys better than him in the coordination department but we all know that when it comes to hand/eye and straight muscle coordination the little guys have a huge advantage over the big ones. When I watch him play I keep thinking about Manute Bol (sp?) stilting his way up and down the court. He ran, and I use the word loosely, like he had an extra knee joint on each leg. That guy could hardly walk. It would have been a hoot to watch him try to skate, and I'm not sure he was even proportionately as big when compared to his playing colleagues as Chara is when compared to his.  Be interesting to see what the league does with this. It's getting to be a very complicated thing for them. I'm worried that one day soon the result will be ridiculously draconian solutions that ignore the nuances and address only the result of a big hit. That's wrong in a game that is so fast and physical by it's very nature.  JF"
559891,Live2fish85,2011-03-09 16:03:00,1633,I read above that he was just doing his job. If he wasn't trying to injure him he would have keep with him and took him into the boards but he hit him directly into the Stanion and if he finished the check he would have done it differently he more so pushed him. Im all about big hits but get rid of the clown for a few games.
559892,Mike Pike,2011-03-09 16:03:00,1332,"It would happen if Chara had hit Campbell's kid!  Yup, Campbell should go, if only for his conflict of interest in handing out punishment."
559897,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 16:18:00,4399,"The bottom line here is the Bruins have always been a tough team and there is nothing wrong with that but they are always a team that looks to bully the opposition and look for retribution  and thats what this hit ways nothing more nothing less, that little push that Max gave Chara is the cause of this and the dust just a guy looking for revenge he saw 67 and took his opportunity.  If you think the Bruins don`t look for retribution just look at Lucic trying to goad Pouliot into a fight last night, what do you think that was all about?  If the league see`s this for what I think it was/is then a lengthy suspension will be handed out if they see it as a guy just finishing his check then this league is messed up!!!"
559906,Leecher,2011-03-09 16:44:00,7832,"WOW.... lots of diverse opinions on here   I know some of you guys see it has a ""clean check"" and some don't but one wonders what was going on in Chara's head at that very moment when he raised his foreharms to give Max the extra push  My intentions of posting this was certainly not to get a war of words going amongst fans and none fans   but to post what had just happened.  Now it's up to the league to determine Chara's outcome.... does he get away with it or does he get nail??  Only time will tell.  Leechman"
559907,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 16:52:00,4399,Just want to thank our mods for editting my post!
559911,Mike Pike,2011-03-09 17:03:00,1332,His hearing with Mike Murphy is scheduled for 12 noon today.
559913,glen,2011-03-09 17:10:00,2641,Dirty hit.  Chara needs to get some.
559917,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 17:15:00,4399,"  Well I guess thats better than Campbell given that Campbell has a history of trying to influence. Amazing this guy still has a job at the NHL, the old boys club at work I guess!"
559920,Live2fish85,2011-03-09 17:19:00,1633,"I don't think that you can say he did it because Max pushed Chara, But I will say that Chara knew what he was doing and it was dirty. I just don't think he did it over a push I think Chara did it because he's a big goof and has no respect for people and there careers."
559921,Grimace,2011-03-09 17:21:00,2020,A telephone hearing means that it will be less than a 5 game suspension.
559923,Grimace,2011-03-09 17:25:00,2020,Severe concussion and a broken 4th vertebrae.   Not good.
559926,Leecher,2011-03-09 17:29:00,7832," Yep, he's out for the rest of the season"
559931,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 17:43:00,4399," So esentially Chara broke his neck!  He`ll be lucky if he plays again,remember Steve Moore!!!   I would say more but the mods will just edit so why bother!"
559935,spooner_jr,2011-03-09 17:54:00,193,"If you don't think Chara intentionally put him into the turnbuckle, you've never played the game.  If Chara was skating backwards and put him in I could buy that he didn't see it, but he was skating directly towards it, and he knew it was there.  Chara has had a bee in his bonnet for Pacioretty since the shove from behind."
559939,Leecher,2011-03-09 17:59:00,7832," Max P. has a long recovery road ahead of him and if he comes back, he'll never be the same player he was..... very sad"
559940,Live2fish85,2011-03-09 18:00:00,1633,Yea you can see that he clearly knew what he was doing and it looks as if Chara reacted as soon as he seen the Glass. I hope that this isn't going to end Pacioretty's Career.
559949,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-09 18:12:00,2582,I tried to stay out of this one...cause I don't cheer for either team or either individual player. But I'm a hockey fan so I got lured in...  I agree with Solo 100% on this one.  I mean he wasn't even close to having a full head of steam going...they where both cruising. An unfortunate outcome for a routine check of riding someone off into the boards.     
559780,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 04:22:00,4399,Word is from Max`s father that he is going to be okay!!!
559782,Rod Caster,2011-03-09 04:23:00,5784,"Brutal hit. Chara knew what he was doing and could have pulled back... unless he has absolutely no spatial cognition, he obviously knew the stanchion was there. Perfect example of a lack of respect for other players."
559783,DanTheMan,2011-03-09 04:24:00,257, I think you hit a nerve on that one!!!
559786,rickster,2011-03-09 04:40:00,495, like paciorettys hit on eaton not too long ago
559788,GBW,2011-03-09 04:41:00,8460,"I can see if it was a hip-check and the other player hit the stanchion as a ""I didn't mean to send him there"" or as a ""mistake"" but that hit could have been avoided."
559789,irishfield,2011-03-09 04:42:00,26272,Chara's been a big goon for years...
559793,PikeMolester,2011-03-09 05:30:00,428,For those thinking Chara's actions were not deliberate... This http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ow1cw8l_rm8&feature=fvst and this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2XhQI3K37c show Chara losing his little neanderthal barbarian mind when he is frustrated and embarrassed. He clearly targeted Pacioretty 2 other times before tonight's incident. In the second video Chara b-lines right to Max and starts throwing punches while Max is tangling with another Bruin already. Then tonight this...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx2AxYxgqRA Look at the directionality he launches Pacioretty. Its not 90 degrees into the boards. He shoves him straight ahead directly into the glass. No doubt in my mind it was an action with intent to injure.
559800,Live2fish85,2011-03-09 07:21:00,1633,Even though I hate the Habs I can't see how anyone would think that was clean Chara seen the glass and then hits Max right for it. I can't stand Chara I think he deserves a big suspension. Thats worst then some of these head hits there calling and he knew what he was doing.
559802,jediangler,2011-03-09 09:17:00,1923,"As a Bruins fan, in all seriousness, any play that ends with a Hab going off the ice on a stretcher is a good play. Chara gets a fine and no suspension."
559805,solopaddler,2011-03-09 10:10:00,8605,"I've looked at that vid about a dozen times, completely unbiased.  Sorry, but it didn't look that bad to me, Chara hit him with his shoulder. It certainly wasn't boarding, or a head shot.  The man is so huge and overpowering that an otherwise normal hit has huge consequences for a guy like ""patches"".  And yes, I'd feel exactly the same way if it was Kessel being pummeled.  In ""patches"" case the phrase ""live by the sword, die by the sword"" comes to mind.  Obviously I hope the kid isn't hurt, but hockey is more or less a blood sport. If you find it too rough then don't watch.  No way should Chara be suspended."
559806,solopaddler,2011-03-09 10:11:00,8605,  You've got to be kidding me.
559809,Whitespinnerbait,2011-03-09 10:23:00,2038,Clean Hit
559811,fish_fishburn,2011-03-09 11:19:00,1311,"Sorry boys, but that was a clean hit. Chara was just doing his job and not letting patches get by. When your on the ice you dont know where the glass starts and ends, everything is happening so fast. I have played alot of hockey in my day and have been on both sides of a hit like that. Just the way it is."
559814,DanTheMan,2011-03-09 12:01:00,257," Ya, just like this play, right??? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaG4GSyQ-tQ  WHAT EVER!!!!!"
559823,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 12:43:00,4399,  Clearly the hit you are refering too was checking from behind but it has exactly what to do with this incident?
559826,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 12:46:00,4399,  Incredible!!!  I`d like too spend 10 minutes on the ice with you ya
559830,kickingfrog,2011-03-09 13:02:00,8333,A fanatics role is to overreact.
559834,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 13:09:00,4399,  Overreacting is somewhat easier when you are bomdarded with stupid summations and ridiculous comments!
559839,bigugli,2011-03-09 13:27:00,6138,"It appears, as someone else pointed out, that hockey, today is a blood sport. A game where hospitalizing your opponent is as important as goal scoring.  It's not the game it used to be, that's for sure. This violent game is also trickling down into junior levels with on ice brawls and after game brawls occurring at the 15-16yr old level."
559840,blaque,2011-03-09 13:27:00,2419,"i root for neither team.......actually i dislike both teams and especially chara. I saw it as driving thru a check, and my guess is he probably wanted to sensationalize the hit by stoppin him cold on the stantion........but i wouldnt imagine he intended for the outcome he got. All that being said.........im not chara or patch nor was i in the building so my comments dont amount to a hill of beans."
559842,kickingfrog,2011-03-09 13:37:00,8333, My thoughts exactly.
559843,kickingfrog,2011-03-09 13:39:00,8333, Isn't it great when you look back on the past and only remember the parts you want.
559848,asdve23rveavwa,2011-03-09 13:46:00,2690,"Just watched it, as well, the announcers made the case that travelling at those speeds Chara didn't know where he was, His head was up, he knew exactly where he was.....dirty hit, all the way...has to be a suspension!"
559850,Grimace,2011-03-09 13:51:00,2020,"Tony Massaroti wrote a good article in the Boston Globe today about this hit.  It is titled ""Chara hit difficult to defend"".  I personally did not like the hit.  These guys know where they are on the ice at all times. Plus there was no puck.  I say give him 10 games.  Will not happen because even though Campbell is not presiding over the case he will still have input on it.  Time for Campbell to go."
559851,dobee,2011-03-09 13:52:00,301,"clean hit, just bad luck..  how many times in a game does a forward try and beat the defencemen on the outside and he gets rubbed out?? ALL THE TIME.. this was just bad luck that the partition was there and he kissed it.  If he get rubbed out into the bench the crowd would be cheering and you wouldnt hear two peeps about it."
559731,Leecher,2011-03-09 02:42:00,7832,I don't know if you guys are watching but Chara almost decapitated Pacioretty with a vicious hit  The second period was ended while the emergency staff tended to the injured player.... Man I know it's a physical game but does it really has to be that way  All I can say is I hope Chara get's a big fine for what he did  Hope that Max pulls through
559735,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 02:53:00,4399,"Disgusting hit he intentionally drove his head into the stanchions, he has been looking for an opportunity since that little push a while back. I would like to see a big suspension but that cutless wonder Campbell will not send a message.  Lets hope Patches neck is not broken!!!"
559738,jedimaster,2011-03-09 02:57:00,3472,"Tough hit. That kinda thing has happened millions of times, gettin ridden into the pillars. I thin I would agree with a suspension and I would agree without a suspension. I am really on the fence about this one. I heard he is moving all his limbs, hopefully he is not too badly hurt. I am sure this hit will bring more blood in the next game. Hope it all works out for this young lad."
559739,Leecher,2011-03-09 02:58:00,7832, No kidding    It blows my mind to see a player do that type of coward hit
559742,jedimaster,2011-03-09 03:02:00,3472,Yah you know after seeing the replay a few more times it really looks like chara gave him an extra run with the forearm into the pillar on purpose. I am gonna get off the fence now. Chara should get suspension.
559743,Leecher,2011-03-09 03:05:00,7832, Well here's the replay of it here.... you be the judge  
559748,jedimaster,2011-03-09 03:18:00,3472,All the analysts are calling it a clean finish to a check. I have to disagree. It looked like from the play chara looked up to the boards before he ran his forearm up and gave him the extra push.
559750,chessy,2011-03-09 03:19:00,610,"he new precicly what he was doing, he rode him and could have pinched him off at any time, but like was said here he gave him the extra heave hoe, you can tell by his reaction that he new what he did it was the what me look just like the crosby hit  THE OLD  WHAT DID I DO look  min 10 games  buck chicken pluck betmen wont do it  and i like boston ... so there is no biast here"
559754,bigugli,2011-03-09 03:24:00,6138,"Coming to an arena near you, ""Rollerball"", or Gladiators on ice."
559756,Joeytier,2011-03-09 03:26:00,3990,"I don't see the intent to injure.  I see a big defenceman finishing his check.  Chara is about as clean a hockey player I can think of, to be honest.  I just hope Max isn't too banged up.  And yes, I am a Habs fan."
559758,kickingfrog,2011-03-09 03:31:00,8333,"The nhl has had hits like this for years. The Al Iafrate hit is but one of many. The nhl has chosen not to address the problem properly by padding these areas better, or eliminating the glass in that particular area all together. But hey, those tv talking heads that sit between the benches now sure need to be protected."
559760,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 03:36:00,4399," Go have another drink, Chara`s a bully plain and simple.  You probably think the Maclaren hit on Zednik a few years ago was just a big defenceman finishing his check."
559761,ctranter,2011-03-09 03:37:00,543,"You never wanna see that happen, but I don't think Chara's intent was to plow his face into the stanchion.  I think he tried to finish his check and ride Pacioretty into the boards, taking him out of the play, but instead put too much into his check.  Don't get me wrong, accidents still have consequences and I'm sure the league will come down on him, especially if Pacioretty is seriously injured afterward.  But to me, it's just a crappy accident that can happen with hockey (like getting your face sliced up by a camera hole.  I consider a check from behind 2-3 feet off the boards to be a much more egregious offense.  Hopefully the kid is ok."
559762,Joeytier,2011-03-09 03:38:00,3990,"Since neither of us will ever know one way or another, I'd suggest you stop with the personal attacks, bucko."
559763,canadadude,2011-03-09 03:40:00,769,"He got a game misconduct, so it wasn't to clean according to the ref"
559764,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-03-09 03:41:00,0,"Wasn't really that dirty, it just ended bad... I guess Chara might still get suspended, but he shouldn't.  Seems that the only people that are upset are habs fans.  ""Qu'elle surprise"""
559765,BillM,2011-03-09 03:42:00,17367,"I wonder what Iafrate thinks of this hit, lol"
559766,kickingfrog,2011-03-09 03:43:00,8333,"'Cause no ref has ever made a mistake? Or made a call in the home teams favour? Or a call for the phabs????  The ref called the result, not the play. Should have been 2 minutes for interference."
559767,canadadude,2011-03-09 03:44:00,769,Whats considered dirty? when his actual head is severed and rolls around the rink.....give me a break
559769,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 03:51:00,4399,"  Imagine that!!!  Seems all the hab haters think its not all that bad, probably a different story if it was Phil Kessel on the recieving end of the hit!!!"
559770,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 03:54:00,4399,  Interference   I am starting to worry about you Rob!!!
559771,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 04:00:00,4399," If I remember correctly Al was hit before the stanchion and slide across the boards on his   and hit the stanchion back first and his hair exploded, I don`t think Tom laidlaw drove him into the stanchion!"
559772,GBW,2011-03-09 04:00:00,8460,"after looking at this time and time again; it's a dirty hit IMHO.  I plalyed rep hockey for many a year and did have an honest chance at going on but 2 hit's like that cut me off from playing.  I can honestly say (and yes, this isn't right) that when I was boarder line not being able to make the bigs that I would consider hitting a person in this 'dead' zone but didn't."
559773,brifishrgy,2011-03-09 04:02:00,559,just watched it on youtube .. Chara will be sitting  .. he deserves at least 20 but they will probably let him off with 2
559779,perchslayer666,2011-03-09 04:20:00,280,Bruuuuuutal hit.... Patches could have been killed.
