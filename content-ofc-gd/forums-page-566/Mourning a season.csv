559357,Rod Caster,2011-03-08 01:42:00,5784,"A buddy just texted me ""Only one week left on Nipissing"".  Is anyone else aleady missing winter, fearing spring and dreading another boring summer?"
559358,BillM,2011-03-08 01:47:00,17367,"You aren't trying hard enough if summer or spring is boring, lol.   Bring on the steelhead, then the residents, then the warm water species, by the time that's all over we are back into steelhead and then icefishing.  It never stops!"
559361,cheaptackle,2011-03-08 01:52:00,849,"Chad you losing it or something?  From what I know of you you're a 365 day per year guy - not chunks here and there!  Especially in your area!  Buck up there dude, change tackle and have at it!  Michael"
559369,mercman,2011-03-08 02:13:00,7054,surely.....you jest RC !! I have my new boat coming in a few weeks and i cant wait to get  her on the water !!!Come on softwater season.
559372,Nipfisher,2011-03-08 02:34:00,2449,R.C. I have 3 boats (motors) and a canoe. We'll take a quad trip this year into the deep bush. When I get permission we can hit a few remote lakes.
559380,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-08 02:40:00,2050,Good Riddance I say!
559381,dhickey,2011-03-08 02:42:00,1038,winter and ice fishing should be year round.	i would go north but theirs no work.  so i gotta wait for long weekends good freinds and bass..  
559402,irishfield,2011-03-08 03:47:00,26272,Temagami is open 'till the 20th!!!
559419,Joeytier,2011-03-08 04:40:00,3990,Close to a month of back lake troutin for this guy.  The best is yet to come
559426,dhickey,2011-03-08 05:01:00,1038, whats it like ? never been there.  early spring ice stable? what about the fishing? so many questions .no body i know has any ansures?????
559427,Cookslav,2011-03-08 05:05:00,1457,"Ya...I'm done LOL!  I'd like to get out again, as my first, last and only time on the ice this year came in February and it was S-L-O-W.....to say the least. But I think I'm euker'd.... Bring on the big thaw"
559451,camillj,2011-03-08 11:20:00,1988,In a strange sort of way I have to agree ... Hardwater season seems to be the shortest one to me ... really only a month or two of opportunity ... and lucky to get out 2 or three times ... oh well ... One of the things I love about Ontario ... we get FOUR seasons... bring on the chrome !!!
559460,Rod Caster,2011-03-08 12:33:00,5784,"Merc- Indeed I jest. I was kidding...kind of!  JoeyT- back lake trout fishing, defnitly a late season treat!  Cheaptackle- I believe there are 365 1/4 days in a year.  Irish- Temagami is on my list of re-visits, as long as the weather doesn't turn like last year. It was +20 in late march,2010.  NipFisher - Great offer! Yes, we definitly have to do a back-bush adventure this year  In some ways it sucks living in a condo... I can't even park a boat. If I could own a little tinny I think I'd be missing winter a little less."
559463,grt1,2011-03-08 12:40:00,638,"-31 degrees here this morning, 4 feet of ice on the lake, I sure pity you southern ontario guys who get to put their boats in early. LOL  I just wish it would warm up and melt."
559483,Leecher,2011-03-08 13:50:00,7832,"Chad, season close March 31st up here.... still lots of fishing opportunities left compared to last year which we had an early thaw  Then it's square tails in late April  ps Did you get that pic of the big walleye you caught sent to Geoff??"
559490,Rod Caster,2011-03-08 14:01:00,5784," I put it on the Team 8 page and he said he'd submit it. Either way, you still have 23 days to beat it! haha"
559492,Leecher,2011-03-08 14:04:00,7832, 
559498,irishfield,2011-03-08 14:25:00,26272,I also should clarify.. that is only Lakers that close on the 20th.. other species remain open beyond that!
559528,perchslayer666,2011-03-08 15:58:00,280,"This year it'll be a late winter, hopefully you can still be on cooks bay ice until early april this year.... Nothing beats late ice Yellows and Crappies...  But yea, can't wait for open water pickeral and bass fishin' and really just the feeling of cruisin on the boat on a nice summer's morning."
559532,DRIFTER_016,2011-03-08 16:03:00,10439,  Depends where in the North you go. Plenty of work in my neck of the woods and we still have about 2 more months of ice fishing to go. Sorry we don't got none of them dumb green fish up here though.
559536,Twocoda,2011-03-08 16:07:00,4130,Mourning the passing of winter is like mourning the passing of gas... WHAT A RELIEF ITS GONE!!!
559542,Rod Caster,2011-03-08 16:31:00,5784,  
559641,spincast,2011-03-08 23:41:00,3279,"  my sentiments exactly I will gladly mourn the loss of gloves, toques, boots, snow shovels and treacerous roads in exchange for shorts, boats, soft water and swimsuits- you have the black arm band, I'll take sunscreen and a cool ale on the patio relaxing in the warmth of the sun! Bring it on"
559817,cityfisher,2011-03-09 12:25:00,959,"Ice fishing is ok, I do it to get by the winter , spring summer is the best"
560023,I'mHooked,2011-03-09 20:46:00,525, Good one! Who needs the Greenies when your average Laker is probably north of 20lbs!
