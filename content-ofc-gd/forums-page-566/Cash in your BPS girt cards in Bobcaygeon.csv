559928,Beans,2011-03-09 17:33:00,3339, Thanks Daryl...At todays gas prices it costs just too damn much to drive to BPS and back especially when I only get 6.5 kilometers per liter... from my old ('95) Ford 150 Enforcer...   
560199,Sinker,2011-03-10 05:27:00,8692,How is the selection in that shop? I've never been there. I'm gonna have to check it out asap....  S.

560335,Sinker,2011-03-10 19:46:00,8692,do they sell hunting gear in there too? Where is this place? Never seen it before........  S.
560443,Beans,2011-03-11 00:27:00,3339, Yes they sell hunting stuff Shane...at least I saw them sell a cross bow last time I was in there...  They are located next door to Corky's Small Engine Repair just east of the four stop sign corner at the north end of town...
