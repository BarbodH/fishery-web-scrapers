559527,Beans,2011-03-08 15:54:00,3339,  Gas Coupon      I didn't realize this but these coupons are good for one Liter of gas at most retailers. I've seen them around lots but never knew what they were for.  You probably have one lying around somewhere -     Make sure to use it before it expires!!        v    v    v    v    v    v          
559538,tb4me,2011-03-08 16:16:00,3295,"lol and yikes all a the same time....wont be long my friend, wont be long"
559540,Beans,2011-03-08 16:23:00,3339, I understand it is damn near that a gallon in the states...   
559548,crappieperchhunter,2011-03-08 17:13:00,2582,Debbe lets me have 2 of those shiny blue bills a week. Sometimes 3 a week if I am really good
559691,jjcanoe,2011-03-09 01:09:00,744,I printed off a hundred of them!  no expiry date!!!!  (runs to the store to get more printer ink)  jjcanoe
559699,cheaptackle,2011-03-09 01:35:00,849,"ummmm..... 4.54 litres in a Canuck Gallon.... $1.219 per litre....  Carry the three etc. and add it all up and...                           $5.53426 per freakin gallon!  I might be a half century old but I can remember as a kid of about 8 when the old man carped about it getting over 20 cents per gallon!  But... In a lot of places you'll pay more than a buck plus taxes for 1/2 litre bottle of water, so at least gas is cheaper than that!  (grrrrrrrrrrr...!!!!)  Michael"
559702,Rod Caster,2011-03-09 01:39:00,5784, Is gas going up or is our money getting worthless???
559706,cheaptackle,2011-03-09 01:43:00,849,"Dunno which but I think I'm going to start accepting our second official currency as payment, use it to buy gift cards and use those to buy gas (it works!)  Michael"
559709,irishfield,2011-03-09 01:44:00,26272, YES!
559711,vinnimon,2011-03-09 01:51:00,2593,  Received an older version of that one not too long ago as change But he says he gets them all the time
559713,Fisherman,2011-03-09 01:52:00,7201," And you wonder why people don't have a pot to whizz in or a window to throw it out of.  As part of my taxes,  I pay a $1.18 for a cubic metre of city tap water, for those that can't figure it out, 1 cubic metre equals 1000 one litre bottles and at the rate above would sell for about $2000.  But, it wouldn't be cool to run your water through a Brita filter and fill up your own container now would it.   I understand some have low quality water, but,  most of the world I see wandering around with a water bottle in hand need a healthy smack upside the noggin, not to mention the waste of plastic."
559715,mercman,2011-03-09 01:56:00,7054,Wow....a 5 buck bill !!!! I havent seen one of those in years I thought they were extinct.
559720,lookinforwalleye,2011-03-09 02:05:00,4399,judging by the number of large p/u and SUV`s commuting down highway at 110 km/hr with only a driver in the vehicle I would suggest the price of gas is not an issue!
559721,Rod Caster,2011-03-09 02:10:00,5784,  Correct. In europe the price of fuel is much higher.
559723,Fisherman,2011-03-09 02:15:00,7201,"It's more than just the price of gas in Europe that affects what people drive.  Engine size per ccm, HP, amount of pollution, size of vehicle, etc.  It all adds up for your licence."
559816,Billy Bob,2011-03-09 12:16:00,5865," It's either that or walk.......one thing I notice when traveling in Canada, especially the 401 and QEW.....all the people who live on east side of Ontario work on the west side of Ontario and all the people who live on the west side of Ontario work on the east of Ontario....now if we could just get these folks to switch houses there would be no traffic when I'm towing my boat to go fishing.  See it's not that hard to solve these traffic problems....you just have to think like a Yank....   And the price of gasoline will go back to $.20 per liter...."
559821,mercman,2011-03-09 12:33:00,7054, BB....yer a legend in yer own mind but it is a great idea though
559901,Beans,2011-03-09 16:34:00,3339, At 3.79 liters per 1 US gallon x $1.219 =$4.62 per Us gallon  I guess it is still worth while buying your gas in the states if you live near the border but not by much as some states are close to $4.00 per gallon...      
559941,Billy Bob,2011-03-09 18:01:00,5865, At the present time.....and I STRESS present time our gas is running between $3.66 to $3.69 per gallon.  I have seen the gas station closest to me has gone up 3 times in 24 hours.
