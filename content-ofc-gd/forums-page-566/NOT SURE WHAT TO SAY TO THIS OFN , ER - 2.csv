A couple months ago I posted on the network that I was in search for a fishfinder , well wouldn't you know it I got a PM the next day from Mercman telling me he had an extra finder and I could have it ! Well I promptly sent him a PM back saying you mean ""FREE"" and he replied yes ""FREE"" I won't get into details about the model but just to say its not a cheap unit that's for sure . He even sent it to my door from Quebec for nothing. I hope everyone here realizes what a great bunch of people we have on this fourm and as well as what a generous person Paul is !!!  Thanks again Paul Cheers Dave"

559450,Fishnwire,2011-03-08 11:08:00,983,I'm in need of a new (insert whatever Mercman has an extra one of) myself.  Seriously though...sounds like a class act.
559489,GBW,2011-03-08 13:58:00,8460,very cool
559491,Leecher,2011-03-08 14:01:00,7832,Right on Paul   WTG

559494,skeeter,2011-03-08 14:10:00,1907,"A class act indeed ! That's not the first time he has done something like that for someone on this board. He has a big heart and is funny as hell !! There is a lot of stuff he does here that goes unnoticed, like making banners for other fishing teams, back ground pictures ect. And he sells an awesome bar b q sauce called ""Cattle Boyz"""
559508,Live2fish85,2011-03-08 14:55:00,1633,Thats Awesome and a great deal for you. It's nice to see that there are people out there that still have heart and decency. In Hamilton here most people just beat you up and take your stuff. lol
559515,fishnsled,2011-03-08 15:19:00,3520," Just checked them out on the web, lots of good stuff there. Thanks for the heads up Skeeter and good on a Paul!!"

559552,MCTFisher9120,2011-03-08 17:32:00,3761,"Cliff gave me a good deal on my portable fish finder the fall before last, I was new to the area and after a few PM's he came to my house and dropped it off, even threw in a pack of brand new batteries. Also dealing with another few members selling my rods and reels I thought I offered good deals back and well it pays off in the end, a bunch of really great guys here that deserve a  A great community indeed."
559557,mercman,2011-03-08 17:45:00,7054,Thanks guys !!! I would do the same for any and all of you.  I was in the market for a Nav card for my Humminbird.A member(who will remain anonymous because i'm sure he would want it that way)Gave me one for free. UNBELIEVABLE !!! You are all familly and this is and incredible place to live.   
559571,HTHM,2011-03-08 18:35:00,4082,"I would have to agree, Paul's OK. We spent a little time together over dinner not that long ago, and both enjoyed the experience. Probably my experience was better than his, but the next time I'm in town, we are gonna hit the water together."
559589,mercman,2011-03-08 19:56:00,7054," Sheesh.......you guys are gonna ruin my reputation.The pleasure was all mine Albert.  The fact is, i'm pretty sure from what i have seen in here, this kinda stuff happens alot.Most of the time it goes un noticed. Its just the way we seem to be."
559599,mattybculp,2011-03-08 20:46:00,388,"I cant agree more with the above postings, I keep telling all my friends what a fantastic forum website we have here. Such a great mix of individuals.
