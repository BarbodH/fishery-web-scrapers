559068,Mike01,2011-03-07 13:12:00,378,"Might pick up a couple of these while I'm in Florida, has anyone tried them yet?"
559074,Grimace,2011-03-07 13:43:00,2020,My dad has one.  Not a very good rod at all.  My mother saw someone on tv going on about how amazing it was so she went out and bought one for dad.   We fish walleye so that rod is not good for the subtle bite.  If your fishing for aggressive bass or whatever I am sure it would be fine.  But again I must say that the rod did not impress me one bit.  But to be fair most rods in that price range are of little use to me.
559075,GBW,2011-03-07 13:44:00,8460,I have a Voltaeus and like it.  It's much better then an Ugly Stik.  BPS and other places sell them so no need to wait to go to FLA to get one.
559138,Jacob,2011-03-07 16:57:00,186,It's farly lite but more expensive than the ugly stick.
559154,LucG,2011-03-07 17:35:00,779,"Ive got a 6'6"" Med Fast casting rod and I've got it paired with a Shimano Crusix. I'm not sure if its the reel or rod, but I don't seem to like it at all. Havent had the chance to experiment with diff combos and lines, but theres something about the stainless steel guides that I don't like. Are stainless guides better for mono vs braid?"
559198,archer379,2011-03-07 19:42:00,277,i have one not all that inpressed with it.
559550,cwpowell,2011-03-08 17:30:00,265,I have one I love it. Caught lots of walleye on it this past summer. It's pretty much my main rod. I would by another in a heartbeat.
559590,jedimaster,2011-03-08 20:00:00,3472,I heard you can catch a shark with it.
559594,Mike01,2011-03-08 20:15:00,378,"I watched a guy bring a shark in on a Barbie rod, now thats impressive"
559753,BillM,2011-03-09 03:21:00,17367,"Sounds like the Ugly Stick, lots of umph, but zero feel."
559768,The Urban Fisherman,2011-03-09 03:48:00,2050,"wow - tough crowd...depends on what you're using it for... Obviously it's a far cry from a crucial or compre or anything as such but it certainly has it's place...  And to some people it might be the only decent rod within their price point.  First off it comes in various sizes and actions, so if you're not using the right action or size rod for what you're doing of course you aren't going to feel anything.  Personally I'm planning to get one as a carp rod, as it can certainly handle the power of a big carp, and I don't have to worry to much about beating the rod up while crawling through the bush to get to my fav. carp spots.  It's also a good spinnerbait rod, crankbait rod, anything that you're going to cast and retrieve because when you get a hit you're gonna know it.  These are just my thoughts, you can take them however you think.  Pick the rod up in a store and see how you like the feel.  I was a fan of the metal guides on berkly ligtning rods and still use one as my panfish stick, but for the price point, I'm very please with what I see in the Voltaeus.  There's going to be a couple in my arsenal this year for sure, right along side my Crucials, Compre's and my little old lightning rod panfish stick.  Cheers, Ryan"
