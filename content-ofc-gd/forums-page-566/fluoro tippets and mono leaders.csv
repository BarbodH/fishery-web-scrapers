Now is it just me or when tying the triple surgeon, and bringing the line through the looping,  I find the two pieces don't stick together like mono 2 mono? Don't know if I'm clear on that. Anyone else experiencing that? Thanks....tight lines! Fred"

When I joining similar light floro to mono (8lb or less) I found  that nothing beats the strength and ease of the Orvis tippet knot. Don't be fooled by the simplicity of this knot, it is very very strong and reliable.  I have used it for over 15 years and its is awesome.  For larger diameters the stre3ngth of the knot is not that important so the surgeon's knot is fine.  muddler"

559679,Garnet,2011-03-09 00:37:00,2056,I've used the triple surgeon on every size Spider Thread Braid. Don't go to far apart in diameter and hold all 4 lines and pull at same time to cinch down.
