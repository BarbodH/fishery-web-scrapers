560003,bassfighter,2011-03-09 20:22:00,366,"Hooked up with Rade, who has not fish the entire winter months, invited him to fish on Tuesday. We appreciated the nice weather we had. It was sunny and hardly any wind. Since few fish were landed by everyone on site, I would not consider it a good fishing day, maybe a tanning day would be more appropriate.  Water clarity was 5 ft Temp = close to zero degrees by 1pm. Wind = 5-15km, mostly calm Number of anglers on site = 10-15 # of fish I had witness landed that day among all anglers on site = less than 8 in 6 hours we were there.  We originally wanted to fish the Niagara river, after we got there, the trail was the iciest I have ever witness, probably from last few days of warm rainy weather. Rade fell twice just hiking 20 meters on his way down on the Icy stairway. I then insisted that we fish it next time and head back up to avoid further casualties. Viewed from the top, we only saw two anglers down there that day.  Then we tried another spot of Niagara, few guys were already fishing there. Fish it for 1.5 hours till 10am. No luck for anyone, just hang up galore for all of us. Around 10:30am, we switched location and city. Being somewhat lucky, got my fish after my second cast bottom bouncing using my tweaked pinked bucktail. Then skunk the entire day, just trying to develop some arm muscle.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/joshbrown2.jpg  Improvised Bucktail with Pink grub http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/pinkbucktail.jpg  Fake pink hair material used to make bucktail. From Dollarama http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/pinkhairforbucktail.jpg  Since fishing slowed down by 5:00pm and 3 other anglers around by then, Rade gave me some lesson on how to cast with my $30 Ukraine made centerpin. It was cool learning how to cast and practice. By 5:30pm, we decided to head back home.  Rade, an experience Pinner tried my centerpin and said he was impress with the $30 price I paid off ebay, he said its action was as decent as any $200 pin out there. The water current pace where we were fishing was not fast at all, yet the float was stripping my line off my pin with no hesitation. I was impress with both the action of the pin and the Siglon line. Mastering the weight distribution of a float and counterbalancing with right amount of split shot, to be applied to the speed of a water current will all be my next challenge.  Image of the $30 Ukraine made Centerpin backing were added with Aqua colored Vinyl & cork pad from Michael craft store, then some 15lb mono line, Fluro pink colored 12 lb Siglon F line from ebay that cost me $20 and finally 10 lb flurocarbon leader. http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/centerpin1.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/centerpinwithfloat.jpg  Rade was using his Okuma centerpin that has a built in drag magnetic system, he was also using my 3/4 oz pink bucktail without any hang up issue. Fished from 10-15 foot depth, He landed his first fish for this winter season, a 8-10lb dark colored steelhead around 2:30pm. I seldom see anyone using a Centerpin in that spot, I have to try that next time, less potential hang up float fishing. Most people bottom bounce and still get snag. While I Cast, bottom bounce then apply slow retrieve. The place was quite snaggable, I lost 2 buck tailed jig head, snagged more than 10 times throughout the day, got lucky being patient unsnagging it off the bottom. Here are some of RadeÂ’s pictures; He will post more his photos soon.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/Fishandpin.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/rade2.jpg  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/radesteelhead.jpg  One of the biggest frustration I was getting lately was my line kept on snagging into other inconsiderate angler's line. On one occasion while it was not too busy late in the afternoon, one angler fishing on one end of the boardwalk (the distance of a basketball court size away) drifted his line all the way to the other end where we were fishing. When I caught his line, I thought I caught a fish since no one was beside me, I was shock, mad, and yielded at him to fish just on his spot. Lack of fishing success and experience made some anglers desperate and annoying."

560022,TDunn,2011-03-09 20:41:00,680,I fished Port D once....I had the same problem.  Nice fish!   TDunn
560030,misfish,2011-03-09 21:01:00,29133,"Thanks for the great report.   FYI  When posting pics from photobucket,use the bottom img icon,right click then paste here.    When I fished port,we fished the dam. Tricky foot steps were required to get passed the guys next to you to bring the fish down to the end of the wall.Even pass yer rod to a guy and make a move to get passed another angler.Never an issue.Whats going on these days with anglers?"
560031,BillM,2011-03-09 21:02:00,17367,"I dunno, I used to fish Port D all the time when I lived there.  The powerplant, the 3 falls, all over the place.  Never had a single issue back then."
560039,misfish,2011-03-09 21:13:00,29133, Darn pinners are to blame.
560042,BillM,2011-03-09 21:21:00,17367,"I don't think it's the pinners casting their BB rigs at boats that float to close to the pier, lol."
560050,ketchenany,2011-03-09 21:42:00,3229, It must have been when they were all trying to fend off the Americans!
560124,canadadude,2011-03-10 01:03:00,769,"The biggest problem in Port D is anglers short casting lower in the drift, they cast over the upper anglers line constantly forcing frustrating tangles.Short casters essentially cut the drift off for all the anglers fishing above them, there is a reason why everyone fires long casts along that drift, to avoid tangling up and cutting off the drift.It can get alittle heated at times when 1 angler cuts the drift off for 10-15 others drifting the wall.Tangle ups still occure but if everyone cooperates lots of anglers can drift the area with little or no problems"
560203,Live2fish85,2011-03-10 07:12:00,1633,Hey Great report bassfighter seeing all the reports of the Niagara River is killing me and seeing the nice fish. I can't wait to get down there. Nice Fish.
