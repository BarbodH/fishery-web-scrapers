559938,Roy,2011-03-09 17:57:00,13728,Very nice and a great looking meal. Congrats to you!
559943,Live2fish85,2011-03-09 18:01:00,1633,"Looks like A nice meal, Whitefish are a ugly fish but taste amazing."
559957,frozen-fire,2011-03-09 18:28:00,542,They're both stocked fish  The one to the right has it's left pectoral clipped and the one to the left has it's adipose fin clipped.  I had my first taste of fried whitie a couple weeks ago and it's delicious.
559958,frozen-fire,2011-03-09 18:29:00,542,Did you find that they smell like cucumbers? LOL
559959,Headhunter,2011-03-09 18:32:00,5703,"What, no flippin noodles! Your mom makes great noodles, they should be on every plate you have! Congrats on the catch and that plate looks delicious! HH"
559966,Leecher,2011-03-09 18:50:00,7832,WTG young_one     Congrats
559970,Spiel,2011-03-09 18:53:00,9065," Yep, adipose clip.   So it's not just me....LOL  Congratuations Young One, they are yummy, no doubt about it."
559973,johnnyb,2011-03-09 18:58:00,3413,"Nicely done, young_one....no question they are extremely tasty!"
559980,misfish,2011-03-09 19:20:00,29133,Well done.Nice fried fish too.    Yep they sure do.
559981,BillM,2011-03-09 19:22:00,17367,"The naturals are a lot smaller on average then those fish and have a distinct gold tinge to them, gotta make sure you let those ones go"
559984,GBW,2011-03-09 19:24:00,8460,and hear I was under the impression they had a date with my smoker...
559987,young_one,2011-03-09 19:33:00,620,Brooklyn is not exactly down the street from my place I'll rain check the next available whitie
559990,GBW,2011-03-09 19:40:00,8460,"LOL, what do you mean?  It's only a full hour round trip out of your way... it's all good y_o"
559996,Spiel,2011-03-09 19:55:00,9065,"  I disagree, 35 years I've fished that lake with whitefish a main target and I totally disagree with your statement Bill.  Colour variations and size have nothing to do with the stocked vs. natural population."
560002,BillM,2011-03-09 20:14:00,17367,"  That's cool, I've spent quite a few days out there in the past 3 years.   I'm not the only one that's noticed this"
560020,misfish,2011-03-09 20:40:00,29133,"Non the less,nice to see natural whities and lakers."
560045,skeeter,2011-03-09 21:38:00,1907,"You just had to go and tease everyone didnt you .  Nice going, good looking fish and i have to agree with Headhunter, wheres those great noodles?"
560051,Gerritt,2011-03-09 21:43:00,6129,Noodles....  Armageddon!  G
560070,GBW,2011-03-09 22:33:00,8460,AHHAHAHAHAHA  you pay now!
