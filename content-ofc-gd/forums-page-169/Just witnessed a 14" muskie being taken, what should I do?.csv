921848,Big Cliff,2015-06-26 18:39:00,6899,"Now I don't fish muskie although in the 14 years I have been here I have caught plenty however, the only one I have ever kept was one that got the hooks into the gills and was clearly going to die. Right or wrong, I will not waste food, just my up bringing.  Today however I witnessed first hand a 14"" muskie being taken and harvested for food. At first I was really angry and shouted out some obsenities but then I thought ""well, might be that there is family to feed.  I spent a bit of time thinking about the times in my life where things were tough; living on strike pay of $11.00 a week where every meal was KD and whatever I could get to go with it in season or not.  I thought about not being able to understanding the rules or the laws! Then I went in the house, got myself a cold beer and wondered how that osprey could possibly have carried that muskie right up and over my head without the least feeling of guilt and I thought to myself ""life is good""!"

921850,SirCranksalot,2015-06-26 18:47:00,3291,"Damn Ospreys they don't care about slot sizes, they feel sooooo entitled  No doubt someone will chime in to contend it wasn't a real osprey---it was a native guy who figured out another way to destroy fish!!  Or the osprey had the spirit of a native?!"
921854,woodenboater,2015-06-26 19:12:00,2277,ha ha. now if it was a cormorant....
921857,Big Cliff,2015-06-26 19:28:00,6899,Oh I see lots of them out here taking fish that I often wonder how they can even swollow them! I'm sure plenty of them are muskie.
921860,crappieperchhunter,2015-06-26 19:33:00,2582,Thx for the laugh Cliff. As long as the osprey didn't jump out of a boat onto the muskies back no one will care
921861,Big Cliff,2015-06-26 19:36:00,6899,"LOL, well the muskie might"
921864,manitoubass2,2015-06-26 19:55:00,11391,"Holy crap, Cliff has morals similar to mine!"
921868,misfish,2015-06-26 20:39:00,29133,Thx for the laugh Cliff. As long as the osprey didn't jump out of a boat onto the muskies back no one will care  
921871,mr blizzard,2015-06-26 21:11:00,1589,"Your a good man Cliff  I wanted to reach through the screen to grap the guys throat,,,,,but as I read on I realized bulls dont have wings LOL  Good one"
921879,Walleye72,2015-06-26 21:38:00,156,Got me right until the end.  I'm on a laptop and I had to scroll down to read it all.  I'm thinking how much meat can there be on a tiny little musky like that?  I suppose you could make soup.  LOL!!
921880,cheaptackle,2015-06-26 21:48:00,849,"The thought of Cliff's blood boiling over witnessing illegal harvesting got mine into a nuclear meltdown.  I had to read it twice to calm myself at the end.  If I wake up chuckling at 3:30 in the morning I will look up Cliff's phone number that he's always posting to offer his help and guffaw loudly when he answers.  Long days, hot sun, and heavy labor can sure make one susceptible!  Good One Cliff - I have been thoroughly taken!  Michael"
921881,Rodbender,2015-06-26 21:54:00,1027,Cliff I may have to have a beer with you and catch that perpetrator in Flight with my camera  might have to call Joey in for backup probably a female Osprey
921883,Big Cliff,2015-06-26 22:29:00,6899,"It sure is a beautiful sight to see and we have the luxery of being right in an area where we have a couple of them that seem to like to feed. It isn't unusual for us to see 15 or 20+ dives a day although to be honest with you, most of them come up with pan fish.  Oh, and you and Joey (as long as Paul approves) would be more than welcome to come and camp out on our deck anytime and take pictures until you run out of memory cards."
921884,Beans,2015-06-26 22:45:00,3339,You got me with this Cliff...LOL
921888,John Bacon,2015-06-26 23:33:00,3277,"Was the 14"" with or without pinching the tail?"
921941,Fisherpete,2015-06-27 14:09:00,1814,Lmao this post is awesome. Thanks for the laugh.
921949,Lunatic,2015-06-27 15:33:00,536,im applying for an osprey status card.
921950,crappieperchhunter,2015-06-27 15:34:00,2582,im applying for an osprey status card. thx for the chuckle
922009,Paudash,2015-06-27 21:31:00,273,funny thing is I have seen osprey 4-5 times with fish and every time it has been a small musky
