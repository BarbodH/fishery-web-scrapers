921894,msp,2015-06-27 00:34:00,1336,I was invited up to a cottage on Long Lake ( Frontenac ) for the August long weekend. Searched for some info but didn't find much. Im wondering if it worth bringing the boat. If anyone has any info about the lake it would be much appreciated. PM if you prefer Thanks
