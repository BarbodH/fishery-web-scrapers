I have been before, but never fished Stormy or Clear lakes, and hoping to give at least one of them a try when we are up there- any one care to share some ideas?  areas to try, or avoid with a 18 footer? PMs greatly appreciated "
922016,KraTToR,2015-06-27 21:56:00,506,"Restoule camp ground is pretty decent but the government boat launch in town is better than the one in the PP.  I've heard on good authority that the fishing is better in Stormy (more structure) but I'm not sure about the launch... would be interested to find out tho..  One note, my navionics chip didn't have a chart for either lake.."
922018,musky666,2015-06-27 22:03:00,126,launch for Stormy in PP looks pretty good- great view at any rate.
922061,porkpie,2015-06-28 02:46:00,2521,"Stormy launch is great.  The Restoule PP launches aren't worth a darn.  As mentioned, use the launch in Restoule.  It's off, wait for it.... Government dock road lol.  I've had good success in both Stormy and Restoule, but you need to put some time in.  I only do well when I don't have kids in the boat.  A day trip to North bay is worthwhile depending how long you are there.  Worm harnesses trolled slow will keep the kids entertained, tough to find keepers though.  Great launch off Premier road right in town. Have fun."

922075,bow slayer,2015-06-28 11:24:00,1074,spincast if you want to pm me I can answer your questions and help you out. I have been camping and fishing at restoule for 27 years.

922088,porkpie,2015-06-28 13:31:00,2521,"Bells ramp has half the concert slab blown out due to ice.  Might be iffy with a heavy boat, quite a bit of sand.  Apparently they are replacing it, but it might be a few weeks."
922257,bow slayer,2015-06-29 02:34:00,1074,"that ramp always has issues  with the concrete slabs,use to work alot better with just sand"
