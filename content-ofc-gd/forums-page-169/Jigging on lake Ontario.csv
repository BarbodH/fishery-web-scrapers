Thanks for the jiggs Steve. My biggest today was 36"" After got rough and couldn't stay on the spot so went back trolling and picked up 1 King about 15 Lbs. Hope to get out there again. Man when they hit it's like your on bottom."
921769,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-26 05:47:00,8243,It's all CGI don't let him fool you. If I may ask what would a Laker of that size weigh? Just in case it was real!

921844,Jds63,2015-06-26 18:04:00,1365,"Great video !!! Nice boat , lots of room !"
921865,davey buoy,2015-06-26 20:00:00,5505,CGI ?? 18 Lbs Computer generated image I believe lol.
921900,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-27 01:19:00,8243,"CGI, I think, that's how they can make Arnold Swartzenegger look 40 years younger in the new Terminator movie."
921918,Moosebunk,2015-06-27 03:07:00,3970,This is a real treat Steve.  Nicely done.  The most fun way to catch lakers for sure.
921940,moocow,2015-06-27 13:53:00,9,"Thats what I call fishing ! Too many times when Ive been out trolling and dragging everything but the kitchen sink I often wonder "" why aren't  I jigging with a minnow "" or wow what a nice fish too bad the fight ended so quickly and the fish is half dead. On Erie we troll lead cores etc and yes its a very productive method for big walleyes, but the fight equates to dragging up a wet sock. By then the fish is beyond resuscitation. Anybody have recommendations on productive jigging methods / etc for Erie walleye? Id rather give up some quantity for quality?"
921997,SirCranksalot,2015-06-27 20:44:00,3291,sounds like a lot more fun than downrigging. I guess you need some sort of 'autopilot' or whatever to keep your boat in one spot-----or maybe 500 ft of rope!?
922112,Fish Farmer,2015-06-28 16:18:00,2234,"I can't wait till this wind stops to get out there again. As SCL says, lots of rope for sure.   Or an ipilot."

Nice of Steve to share with ya me bye.  I have tried jigging out there before bro but I couldn't stay on one spot because of currant and wind. I think the ipilot is a must or a real long anchor rope. I'll post some results if I get a calm day to be able to jig again, Steve made it look easy, the man was catching steady, his #'s would blow you away."
922138,Steve Piggott,2015-06-28 18:11:00,196,It has to be nice an calm to sit in one spot. but I have also caught them dragging tubes  
922142,misfish,2015-06-28 18:28:00,29133,Great picture of the ole bye Steve.
920253,Steve Piggott,2015-06-16 15:20:00,196,Fun jigging for laker give it a try.   
920256,mike rousseau,2015-06-16 15:40:00,4661,Looks like a blast...
920259,BillM,2015-06-16 15:46:00,17367,Such an under utilized techniques on the big lakes!   Guys trolling around while you're smashing fish    Good job!
920261,shimano19,2015-06-16 15:48:00,196,That looks like an awesome time
920262,Headhunter,2015-06-16 15:58:00,5703,That looks like a bit of fun!!!!! HH
920263,mattyk,2015-06-16 16:22:00,2110,Awesome outing!
920280,Joeytier,2015-06-16 18:21:00,3990,"Looks like a total blast, does lake O even have small lake trout?"
920288,Dave Bailey,2015-06-16 19:07:00,1641,"I would do it. The only lake trout I ever caught was while drop-shotting for smallmouth, can't see why that wouldn't work either."
920310,landry,2015-06-16 20:47:00,1005,Awesome. Would that work all summer Steve?
920312,BillM,2015-06-16 20:48:00,17367,Awesome. Would that work all summer Steve?  You better believe it.
920323,misfish,2015-06-16 21:07:00,29133,Thats a sweet video Steve. Nice handling of the fish as well solo.  Like the boat set up as well. Lots of room to move around.
920325,Mister G,2015-06-16 21:26:00,1429,I don't believe any of this.....it's fake........you must troll to catch fish.......LOL
920326,jtracc,2015-06-16 21:34:00,97,"How often does Lake Ontario stay nice and calm like that? I have tried jigging for them at my buddies cottage in haliberton. It's a blast, they not as big as those lake O beauties but man they can hit hard."
920367,Steve Piggott,2015-06-17 01:57:00,196,Works all summer.Look for places  with steep edges or humps in  70 to 110 ft is where I catch most of my lakers .You have to pick your days when you fish the big lake.Spoons and big twister tails work well also.Talk to your friend that troll the lake and see what depth they been picking up lakers. That is where I start looking for fish.If you mark fish near the bottom they are lakers.
920370,Lunkerhunter,2015-06-17 02:54:00,455,Great video Steve. Looks like a blast
920389,ckewley,2015-06-17 11:38:00,699,Awesome video
920405,msp,2015-06-17 14:28:00,1336,Awesome ! what are you using ?
920423,fishdawg,2015-06-17 16:26:00,912,"Good stuff Steve, I always enjoy the different ways you achieve success on the water. No doubt in my mind, Lake Ontario has the best and least utilized lake trout fishing in the province as far as numbers and average size goes."
920442,fishnsled,2015-06-17 17:46:00,3520,Great video and an awesome day on the water.
920453,mistaredone,2015-06-17 19:20:00,913,That looks awesome!!!!  I'm totally going to give that a try
920496,BITEME,2015-06-17 22:05:00,1968,Next on my to do list Thanks Peter
920507,fishindevil,2015-06-17 22:46:00,6254,Awesome vid !!! And nice fish too !!!! Jigging on lake o is awesome and is a great way to catch them too !!!!! Thanks for sharing
920536,buckster,2015-06-18 01:19:00,530,Well done!
920561,PUMP KNOWS,2015-06-18 03:07:00,937,Wow... thanks for sharing
920575,Steve,2015-06-18 11:18:00,2075,"great vid Steve.  As the King fishing declines year by year (or at least it has over the last three), I see more and more anglers taking advantage of the Lake Trout fishery on Lake O.  When I started 10 years ago, a 20lbs Laker was really big.  Now they are getting 35lbs.  and Mid 20lbs fish are common.  No longer does one need to fly to exotic resorts up north to tangle with 30lbs plus lakers....we have them right at our back door.  I still prefer the flat lining for trout in tight, but jigging for trout can be just as rewarding."
