He looks exactly to a ""T"" exactly how I pictured him tattoos, happy smile and all. Atypical Navy man.  In my 13+ years on this board Johnny, I think your the ONLY person to ever say I had a happy smile, infact most seem to think I look grumpy.  Glad to see you recognized the truth"
922308,Joey,2015-06-29 14:02:00,9122,"wow beauty report thank you for taking the time. Totally sucks about the gas, crossing fingers I never have to live that out!   Thanks Roger.   I hope you never have to do that either.  Sitting there all alone on the side of the road I thought I heard the faint sound of banjos playing   I always love your reports with all the great pictures of the wildlife! The fish pics are nice too! Thanks for sharing.   Thanks so much Matt.   Sorry B and I couldn't get up this year, we missed you guys but lived it a little through Joey's report. Looks like an awesome time was had as always! Glad you took Roy with you..........  Sorry you and Barb missed it too bud   so the bite on the water was slow but the 'bite' on land looked consistent and no one got skunked either ))   "

Great report Joey and fantastic pics!"

Seriously though, I love your photography.  Not only are you so very talented but you obviously like birds, and I love to watch birds. Congratulations on the ski's."
922349,Joey,2015-06-29 17:44:00,9122,"Thanks Will, Mr. Blizzard and Doubleheader  And yes doubleheader, I love taking bird shots and have learned alot about them since I started."

922157,Joey,2015-06-28 19:45:00,9122,"Had a great week up at Mashkinonje Lodge with the great company of Lew, Diane, Rich and Patsy.  We arrived on Saturday, June 20th and they helped us unload our gear into the cottage, that was a nice helping hand after a long drive.  Sat around and gabbed for a bit and then we all started making our suppers.  BBQ's ribs for us and twice baked potatoes.  I ended up burning my arm on the oven grate taking the potatoes out.  Nice scar and it was fun to take care of the rest of the week in the sun!!  Sunday Lew and I fished Muskrat for a few hours.  It was a beauty day and Lew managed 1 pike.  I got skunked    Oh well, was nice weather and great company.  Steak for dinner - YES!  Monday Paul and I fished Muskrat again and got 1 pike each.  We knew we were having a fish fry later in the week hosted by Regan and Goldie so we kept them.  We tried our hand at pickerel later that evening, but only managed some perch - no keepers.  Mosquitos drove us all in by 9:30, which seemed to be the golden mosquito hour every night.  Burgers and salad for dinner.  Thundered all Monday night and poured rain.  We all awoke to terrible winds Tuesday.  Winds too big to be fishing in so we all sat around and made fun of each other   Diane cooked us a great spaghetti dinner.  Goldie brought Caesar Salad, Patsy brought two pies for dessert and I brought buns and fresh grated Parmesan cheese.  Leslie and Zach from Lakair joined us.  Great night, great food and great company!!!  We were all itching to head out Wednesday morning after being grounded all Tuesday due to the winds so we roared down to Muskrat and 3rd cast Paul gets a nice musky - 42 or so inches (we didn't measure).  About an hour later I hooked into a nice one.  We measured her at 44"".  I was happy with that.  Shrimp on the Barbi for supper!  Thursday we headed into town for some supplies in Noelville and Diane joined us for the ride as she needed a few things aswell.  Paul and I fished all afternoon but only caught a rock bass and two mussels (the mussels at the same time on one lure trolling a five of diamonds)   We did our fish fry after Rich and Patsy upped the pike catch by 3 or 4 more.  Enough for the crew there and some more.  Everyone else added to the supper and it was a real feast.  Regan got schooled on deepfrying 101  Up and out Friday for what we knew was our last day to fish.  Paul caught 2 pike and I caught 1 (the biggest ).  25.5 inches, not bad.  Diane made us up a nice chili dinner and once again, nobody starved and we sat around the fire after holding our full bellies.  Check out is at 9 a.m. so we packed most of the stuff up Friday night and we all headed out in the morning     Paul and I had a shock when the gas guage went from 1/4 tank to 0 in about 5 seconds flat.  We pulled off the highway and found a gas station up the road - guess what, they didn't have Diesel and said the closest place was 15 minutes up the highway.  We proceeded crossing our fingers we would make it, but alas, 5 minutes into the drive we ran out.  Pulled over and Paul got out and hitch hiked to the gas station, bought the diesel and hitch hiked back.  While I sat there waiting, about an hour and a half, one of the guys from camp that we had met last year and was there again this year (Adam) saw our truck and boat on the side of the road.  There was no place to pull over so he went all the way to the next turn off and ran back to ask if we were okay.  I was taken by his thoughtfulness to take the time to see if we were okay and if we needed any help.  It was a good jog for him too.  He said he would look for Paul and if they saw him would pick him up, but otherwise we exchanged phone numbers and he asked me to text him if Paul made it back soon.  Sure enough about 10 minutes later Paul did make it back and I texted Adam and thanked him.  So from the two people that picked up Paul and Adam and his buds stopping, we have renewed faith there are still some great and wonderful people who help their fellow man  So home now to some rainy weather.  Gave me a day to download my pics, and here they are.  Hope you enjoy!

922167,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-28 20:00:00,8243,"It sure sounds like you guys had a blast and might have to join Jenny Craig after those scarfs. And you did great fishing too. Can it get any better?  It will take me a bit to go through the pics. How did we afford the days when we had to either get them developed or even the costs for a darkroom? Didn't take 10 rolls of 36 in a week I guess.  I love Noelville, I forgot that French is the primary lingo spoken that way and it was a culture shock to see all the signs in French first.  Did Reagan put ina proper launch there. I hate those rocks right behind the launch, that's my one and only peeve, oh and we stayed in the cottage were the water is 5 feet from the front door. No drinking and going for a walk at night.  Did you find out when the show Italo shot with Reagan will air, or did I miss it?  Great opener girl. Congrats.  JD"

He will launch the boat for you tho and take it out, he did it for us.  Regan did talk about the show, but I think it aired already?   I'll have to ask him.  Thanks Oldironmaker, it was a great week indeed!!"
