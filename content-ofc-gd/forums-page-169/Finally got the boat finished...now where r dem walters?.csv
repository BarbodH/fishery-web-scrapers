LOL…yup, I am a bit early on that lake though, they were still mostly in the 17' to 8' range. The ones that were in deeper water tended to be suspended half way up the water column.   nice job on the restore. that first eye is a beaut  Thanks, still not done completely but the urge to fish and the fact I have an effective bilge pump trumped being patient and doing more tedious work. Next year!LOLOL.   Great video, Simon. You did a super job on the boat refurb as well. Thanks for sharing.  Thanks Roy, more to come. I have actually started to pay a little bit more attention to my Youtube account other than just a means to host videos, turns out I could have been making money on them for years…lol.   Thanks for that, very cool video...especially seeing the fish on the sonar screen. Definitely my favourite method for catching Walleye(or any fish for that matter), soooo much fun!  I call it 'X-Box' fishing.   That was a great video! Seeing fish on the screen adds a whole new level on excitement. Thanks for sharing. Oh and the ""200 trips to Canadian Tire"" comment was perfect. Been there!!  lol ""been there"" 200 times!   Great vid Simon. Like the work you did on the tinner.  Started to laugh at the up they come, then back they go  down. See lots of that here. LOL Frustrating yes, but fun none the less.  Thanks for sharing.  Sometimes its almost better to know they aint there!"
