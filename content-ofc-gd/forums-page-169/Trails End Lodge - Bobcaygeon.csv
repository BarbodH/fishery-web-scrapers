922376,scugpg,2015-06-29 19:53:00,1373,Had the opportunity to stay there recently along with family. What a lovely resort and couldn't believe how good of condition all the cabins are in. Didn't get a chance to fish Pigeon much as was busy with the folks but have stayed there in past years and did well for walleye and even a few muskie. The north end has some great spots for them. Just wanted to mention it in case anyone else is looking for accommodations in the area to give Norm a call.
