922707,Gerritt,2015-07-01 13:39:00,6129,Well I went out fishing yesterday afternoon and wore my US navy issue gortex rain coat.... Best rain coat I have ever owned! Well I took a tumble on the way out losing my footing on a bluff... I'm a little sore but otherwise ok.  How can I clean this jacket? Because it's navy issue it didn't come with care instructions etc.  Any advice how to clean this jacket?  Thanks!  G

922712,Gerritt,2015-07-01 13:56:00,6129,Thanks!!! I was a little concerned with throwing it in the machine.  Never even thought to check out gore-Tex's site lol! I come here for just about everything!
922765,Fisherpete,2015-07-01 18:09:00,1814,Thanks - was wondering about this myself. Remember hearing about a product called Nik-wax (sp?) that you can also use?

Not to the same extent as new but acceptable. Especially worked well on the seam areas to reseal them. Remembering that this is on a 25 year old rain suit, it is fine for summer wear.

Both do an equally good job, IMO. Similar pricing. NikWax can be bought at MEC, and I get Graingers from Sail. I do mine at least once a year with the waterproofing. It keeps the water beading on the surface of the gear. Waders and jackets"
