Took the parents out yesterday evening and dragged lures around - didn't even get a nibble (as discussed earlier).  Went back today with some live bait. 6in suckers (went with Luc's advice). Got a couple bumps, one knock-off and caught a smallish laker. Released without any issues.  Spoke to several other guys and nobody seems to be doing well, guess it wasn't a good week for trout this time. Maybe next year.  "
921931,Rod Caster,2015-06-27 12:23:00,5784,Better than a skunk! Nice weather eh?
922310,LucG,2015-06-29 14:08:00,779,"Any atlantics Luc? Or all Lakers?  No atlantics. All lakers.  Since I started this thread I guess I'll give it some closing comments.

920539,Sterling,2015-06-18 01:32:00,477,"Anybody here have experience fishing for Trout in Trout Lake, North Bay?  It's open for 1 week starting Saturday. I can't imagine the trout population is pressured much... so the fishing must be good while it's allowed.  I'll probably find a deep spot and fish the thermocline, otherwise I'm at a loss.  Any tips?"
920542,Joeytier,2015-06-18 01:39:00,3990,"It holds lots of lake trout and atlantic salmon.  If you know how to fish for trout you'll find fish!  I'll be out there once or twice next week trolling around.  The thermocline will not be deep, but the fish may be, since the primary forage (smelt) are typically deep water bait fish."
920552,Dave Bailey,2015-06-18 02:34:00,1641,"Yeah, 1964! My uncle was a meathead at the Bomarc base, took us kids there, and that's where I caught my first pike."

I'm pretty new to downrigging but I figure gang trolls and a threaded minnow?"
920557,Gallie,2015-06-18 02:57:00,1215,"If that doesnt work you can try running a spoon off the ball, i havent seen too many deep water fish that wont hit a good spoon."
920570,musky666,2015-06-18 09:51:00,126,Might be worth a trip into Turtle Lake at the east end- we were in there looking for Musky last summer and there were a few boats trolling in the 'middle'. Watch for rocks and shoals however... I found one
920573,Parnelly,2015-06-18 11:10:00,108,"Turtle lake is awesome for Bass and Musky. Stay to the right side going in. However, I think he's looking for Trout."
920588,Rod Caster,2015-06-18 13:00:00,5784,"I'd love to hit an Atlantic this year! From what I've heard, they feed quite shallow and long-lining flutter spoons works.  For the lake trout, Joey put up good advice/information"
920629,Sterling,2015-06-18 17:18:00,477,Are you sure there are salmon in the lake? I figured the MNR had just used a blanket limit.
920645,Joeytier,2015-06-18 19:43:00,3990,"There are plenty of atlantic salmon in trout lake, yes."
920650,esoxansteel,2015-06-18 20:17:00,1307,"Yes there are Landlocks (Atlantics) in Trout Lake, they were stocked many years ago, and apparently were restocked again after a spill in Mink Creek which feeds into Trout Lake."
920652,musky666,2015-06-18 20:43:00,126,Pretty sure the fellows in the middle or deeper area were down rigging- for Lakers I assumed.
920653,Joeytier,2015-06-18 21:12:00,3990,"Four Mile Creek took the spill in the 70's, and is now a sanctuary from hwy 63 down, acting as a 'nursery' for the atlantics."
920666,chris.brock,2015-06-18 23:44:00,4053,"So what's the deal with the Atlantics? I always thought they were a struggling, vulnerable natural population. Were they stocked and naturally reproduced?  Pretty unique story either way."
920679,Nipfisher,2015-06-19 03:14:00,2449,Every year I have buddies that fish it for Lakers during the brief open period. They get their limits in under 30 minutes of fishing. I think Joeytier may know a thing or two about those silver walleye....lmao
920687,Rod Caster,2015-06-19 12:05:00,5784,"They were stocked, then they started reproducing (think Lake O rainbows). There is a good report somewhere on the internet about them. The only known spawning area is Four Mile Creek (also where the spill took place years ago)... one year they counted like 3 or 4 fish that was it.  I think its very cool that they are in the lake, but I wish they continued stocking them and created a fishery instead of just locking down the lake for trout and salmon. Either way, I hope to get out for trout/salmon this year for the first time."
920726,Sterling,2015-06-19 18:20:00,477,"Nipfisher: any idea whereabouts they're fishing? I figure it can't be rocket surgery - find a deepish spot and put riggers at 25-40ft?  Rod Caster: I read through the report. Very interesting. The population was introduced in the early 1900s, decimated in 1967, and once again introduced in the late 80s. The population was struggling in the early 90s but I presume it's healthier now.  Atlantic Salmon were in lake Ontario but we managed to extirpate them from even that lake. From what I read only Trout Lake has a self-sustained population of landlocked salmon in Ontario. Neat stuff."
920765,esoxansteel,2015-06-20 00:18:00,1307,"Lake Champlaine is also another one of those interesting fisheries that sports Landlocks as well   New Brunswicks St John river is also another one, that sports muskies and some very large ones, with abnormally large girths, and also Atlantics, and ironically the Atlantics DO NOT make up a very large portion of the muskies diet in that river considering the massive girths of some of these fish,  Odd ball fisheries are unique and interesting"
920802,Rod Caster,2015-06-20 12:30:00,5784,"I believe the population is healthier now; you hear more reports of guys accidentally hooking into them.  Four Mile Creek used to be the main location for smelting in North Bay. It's been a sanctuary for years, but the MNR just let it happen. As of a couple years ago they enforced it better... I'm sure that'll be good for the young Atlantics.  For years now I've planned on going to the creek to count/watch the Atlantics in the fall, somehow that never happens. I guess counting Atlantics for no purpose other than my own is not high on my priority list."
921364,Sterling,2015-06-23 23:28:00,477,"So, anyone have any luck?  Haven't been out yet unfortunately, hoping to get out there tomorrow, weather permitting."
921370,Joeytier,2015-06-24 00:18:00,3990,"I wont be able to make it this week, unfortunately"
921415,Rod Caster,2015-06-24 12:09:00,5784,"Ya, Joey bailed on me.  Lots of boats out there... a guy showed me a 23lb trout he caught last year!"
921833,Sterling,2015-06-26 16:33:00,477,"Went out for 4 hours yesterday and... nada. Fishing with gang trolls + spoons at varying depths. Depth finder wouldn't show a thermocline (first time in deep water with that unit) so I was pretty bummed about that.  Spoke to 2 other boats and they didn't have any luck.  Also spoke to a guy at the landing that caught one while trolling for eyes (too big, released).  Take 2 tonight with threaded minnows."
921835,LucG,2015-06-26 16:48:00,779,"I've been out three times this week. Caught fish 2 of 3 outings. Most the fish were released, with 2 being of legal size. Largest was about 13 lbs.  I was fishing with steel line, 6"" spoon, with a threaded 6"" suckers. I was fishing just above bottom, with most fish biting seconds after making bottom contact. Depths was between 40-60.  My partner was fishing lead core with a gang troll and spoon with no luck. Closes tonight, go get em while you can. Good luck!"
921842,Joeytier,2015-06-26 17:58:00,3990,Any atlantics Luc? Or all Lakers?
