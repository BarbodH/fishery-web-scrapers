Not necessarily,  if you only buy stuff with credit which you were going to pay for cash anyway, and then pay it off right away, its a great way to build credit rating, its when you go over your expendable income when you get into trouble.  for example, if you're buying something for $200, and have the cash readily available, then use your card, and pay it off immediately"

I asked him if there was anything they could see that I should have done differently and he said NOT to worry it wasn't my problem and they were going to fix everything.

As a looked down at the transactions I noticed five that I didn't recognize.  Four were from ruletap.com and one was from allotect.com.  Have no idea who either of them are from.  Never had this happen to me, but I knew what to do and kind of panicked.  It totaled almost four hundred dollars.  I called MC and told them my problem and they said they are going to deal with it.  Hopefully I can get this all straightened out.  Going to call them again to see if anything was fixed.  Oh and to make things worst when I called MC I couldn't even understand what the lady was talking about cause her accent was pretty strong and I think she was on speed lol."

921437,fishing n autograph,2015-06-24 15:14:00,2540,I had the same problem. I opened a Kohls MasterCard in the US but never activated it. A year later I get a statement from Kohls saying I owe them $800 from a purchase of luggage in Wichita KS. I called the store up and told them what happened. It was resolved thankfully.
921439,fishnsled,2015-06-24 15:25:00,3520,"I'm surprised they didn't call you about the transactions.  It's happened twice to me, once for 2 $50 iTunes gift cards - they got my card number from a gas station.  I very rarely use the card and it is usually for gas just to let them know I'm still alive.  They were going to investigate and I had to sign an affidavit saying that I did not make those purchases.  With that card I always got the ""you've got a great credit rating and we are increasing your amount on the card"".  Recently, they sent me a letter stating that they were reducing the amount do to security reasons and if I needed it increased to give them a call.  A wise move on their part.  The other time (years later) was that I had made a couple of small online purchases on secured accounts, so I thought.  Got a call the very next day asking about my recent transactions.  Someone was trying to pay there Rogers account with my card.  I was instructed not to make any payments other than the amount I legitimately owed and they would deal with the rest.  Both times I was impressed that they were on it so fast and they treated me quite well.  Cards were cancelled immediately and new ones came in a couple of days.  Not a big deal for me either time but rather unsettling how these crooks work so fast.  Over cautious these days and that likely is still not enough.  I'm sure things will be back to normal for you pretty soon but is a pain in the   to have to go through this at all."

I didn't realize my card was gone for about 8 hours along with all ID except my passport that the hotel takes and gives back when you pay the bill, thank goodness. I always thought I was too street smart to get pick pocketed, think again. I had about 50 pounds in my pocket and needed to pay for the 3 nights in the hotel and needed cash to get home. In the 8 hrs they had my card they ran up a bill of about 5 grand. Visa was good about it and wired me $1000.00 pounds. I was livid though, how can someone use a card  when I have a pin number? Ok, I told them I was travelling Europe but so much for security. Apparently rural areas of the UK were not yet on the chip thing so all you did was sign. They even got the guys on camera but not much they can do sitting at their monitors at the police station. I hardly ever saw a cop in public, they are all indoors monitoring those CCTV or whatever they are called fighting crime from air conditioned offices. I now use the card for gas only at Petro Canada and that's it, another for CTC and that's it. Same for my wife gas, hotels and restaurants only. Anything else isn't mine."

I hung up and call my financial institution and there are no compromises on any of my accounts or cards. Just a heads up- if you get a call like that, hang up and call you bank yourself, using the number on the back of your card. At least then, you will know who you are talking to and will be able to sort out who is who and protect yourself. HH"

I guess it is true what you said about someone cashing a fake cheque on someone's account, back in the day, that it would have been their money. I could care less though because I NEVER had someone else cash a cheque on my account. So not sure how big a problem it was. In my small town back then all the tellers at both branches of my bank knew me by sight... Maybe in bigger centers it was easier to cash a fraudulent cheque on someone else's account?  I have had 3 separate incidents of my cards being compromised in the last 5yrs and they won't even tell you where or how it happened... Now you just get word your card was cancelled and they are sending you a new one. Only once did they even question whether I had made the transactions or not so they KNEW before hand in 2 cases it wasn't me? Yet they couldn't stop it from going through....  The meaning of customer service to financial institutions today is more like the term used for having a prize animal serviced for breeding if you know what I mean....  We get serviced alright all the time."
