922036,Fisherpete,2015-06-28 00:29:00,1814,"4 of us muskie hunters headed up to fish Restoule Lake for a few days last weekend. After getting a few general location tips from OFC members (thanks guys), we set out and explored the lake, which is not mapped on Navionics. Very nice scenery, dark stained water at an ideal temperature and... no weeds yet. This made for a very tough bite as the muskies were certainly not in their typical summer locations in any numbers. We gave it our all, but three of the four members of this esoxy cast left Restoule with a white stripe up their backs. Luckily yours truly was not one of the three, I managed four muskies (33"",35"",36.5"" and 39""). We had some follows also, but really nothing that looked over 40"". The fish have a very different look up there - extremely dark coloration to the point where you can hardly see their backs in the stained water. Pretty cool.  The fishing was really tough on the last day we were there, so we headed home a touch early and hit Kawartha lakes for the evening - the boys really needed a tug at the end of their line. Andy and I launched the boat, drove to a trolling pass, and in less than 10 seconds he was fighting a muskie. No joke. Makes you wonder why we ever leave the Kawarthas! He proceeded to land three, including a very nice 40.25"" chunker. The other two boys had a couple big follows but still went home smelling like Pepe le Pieu.  Anyways, here's some pics.

922042,Fisherpete,2015-06-28 00:35:00,1814,"We heard that Stormy has some good fishing, but didn't have enough time to explore it. Maybe next time. Hope you find the big one we were after!"
922065,Gallie,2015-06-28 03:41:00,1215,Good work pete! Those skis ate really dark!
922069,Bondar,2015-06-28 05:27:00,817,"Cool looking fish, nice job!"
922071,Rich Clemens,2015-06-28 10:06:00,3131,Glad to see some folks were having some success.   Was on the west arm of Nipissing last week and never saw one.
922073,bow slayer,2015-06-28 10:54:00,1074,"yes there are alot bigger skis in Restoule,I have seen many over 40, and yes I think the fishing for them is better in Stormy and Clear,if there is a next trip for you there definately give those 2 lakes some time.Still some nice fish."
922077,Moosebunk,2015-06-28 11:48:00,3970,"Nicely done Pete.  Dissect some new water and beat a favorite haunt, doesn't matter, you put 'em in the boat."
922079,musky666,2015-06-28 11:57:00,126,"Pretty nice, hope to hit Restoule later this season. Was closer to North bay for last week- one in boat and one follow was it from the Muskies..."
922102,Fisherpete,2015-06-28 14:54:00,1814,"There are big ones in there for sure, we just had a hard time finding them without any cabbage. We tried fishing rock also. Will give it another go later in the season."
922103,misfish,2015-06-28 15:02:00,29133,The ones you are holding pete have some great green hue (sp) color. Very cool.  Andrews holding a couple of nice beasts.  And stop hogging all the fish will ya. Share with your friends.
922108,manitoubass2,2015-06-28 15:54:00,11391,Wow look at those colours!!!!  ??????  Great fish!

922298,Lunkerhunter,2015-06-29 13:02:00,455,that was a fun weekend away pete! and yes you had the mojo going up on restoule for sure. kicked all our butts  funny how things can be so different when you switch bodies of water.  the next time I fish restoule will definitely be when the weeds are established.
922323,theduster23,2015-06-29 15:06:00,11,Looking to head up to stormy / restoule shortly as well.... any and all tips appreciated!
922333,fishnsled,2015-06-29 16:17:00,3520,Nice report Pete! Pretty cool how dark they are up there.  That fish of Andrew's is a beauty!  Good seeing you the other night and we will have to make some arrangements to get some time on the water together this year.  Thanks for the report!
