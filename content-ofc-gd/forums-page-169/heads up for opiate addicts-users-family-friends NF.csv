922038,pics,2015-06-28 00:31:00,1268,My mother was addicted to pills when I grew up and later in life my stepfather and father in laws were drunks. I'm one that tends to shut out those that are a negative influence in my life and maybe fisherman has the same view but didn't express it properly. I grew up in a really crappy environment and my biggest fear is losing everything I've worked for. It's only later in life that I realize how lucky I am that I don't have any addictions to drugs and alcohol....
922047,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-28 01:24:00,8243,"I hear you Pics. My 54 year old brother had the world by the balls, VP of Canadian sales for a large US corp. at the age of 38, an exec for another large Canadian company. He was pulling in well over 6 digits in the 80's. He is a full blown junkie now and is awaiting trial for distribution. As he couldn't hold down a job it is alleged he was selling and that way he would have a constant supply. Lost everything he had. Is not allowed to see his grand children. It is really easy to say we must love them unconditionally and support them. He lived with us 15 years ago ""until he could get back on his feet"", That fiasco lasted a year until we just could not stand the cheating, lying, stealing, hurting and betraying everyone around him. I have seen him once in the last year. I have had to wash my hands of him, I will not have my life ruined by his addiction. We have all tried our best and even tough love hasn't worked. What is left to do? I don't have an answer, for the last 30 years I have been searching foe one. I will get that phone call any day now. Your brother is dead, I know it's coming and I don't feel anything because I am did my, I should say we did our best but it wasn't good enough and now we are numb."

921846,JoshS,2015-06-26 18:24:00,729,"Addiction generally stems from much greater issues (mental health). Recreational use aside, addiction is a horrific disease. Couple that with mental health issues and most effected have little hope to live a normal life. Imagine trying to do that. For those that ""have no sympathy""... I feel sorry for your ignorance. I'd keep the ""no sympathy"" comments to yourself."

So I'm not too quick to write them off. ymmv obviously  There was a photo essay a few years ago looking at coal miners in Kentucky or West Virginia. The miners would work in seams and tunnels that required them to hunch over all day. So after years of this, back pain was a serious issue and oxycontin was one way to deal with it. Unfortunately, some couldn't get off the use when they got better, if they even got better at all.  It was an honest look at what should be a dying industry but is still an economic driver in many southern communities, and it's effect on the miners, their families and the communities as they try to deal with this problem."

I know that's a common problem with oxy. My wife was on it briefly after an operation and that prospect scared the livin bejeezus out of her as we had read and heard of how common and easy it was to slip into an addiction. http://oxywatchdog.com/oxy-stories/"
921966,Big Cliff,2015-06-27 18:25:00,6899,"Two years ago a very wonderful young man entered my life, his name was John and he was only 23 years old. John had a rough start in life, parents that tried but were always busy doing their own thing. You have all seen or heard it before, it is way too common. John found company with some wrong people and ended up into drugs, not a hard mistake to make.  When I met him he was fresh out of rehab, his step father didn't want anything to do with him, his father had given up on him, his mother was doing her best but she had issues of her own to deal with and wasn't doing a great job of it.  John and I quickly became friends, he would come and hang out with me in my shop and seemed to love to learn and boy was that kid smart. We spent many hours working on lawn mowers, trimmers, chain saws. There wasn't a day we spent together that he didn't make me so proud of him.  We would spend hours just hanging out and talking about anything and everything, school, life, girls..... I even got him interested in fishing, set him up with a rod and some tackle and we'd go down to the dock and tease each other about the fish we were going to catch (or lost)and we'd drink a beer or two and just be together. He was a wonderful human being!  I hadn't seen John for about a week when I got the call that he had had a slip and od! He didn't make it.  I was so angry at first, how could he do that to me, to us, and why would he? Then his step father came to see me and told me that ""well, John's demons got the better of him but the good thing was it was only going to cost them $450.00 for the funeral""!  Then I started to understand, if that is the kind of life you have been brought up into and those are the kind of attitudes you have pushed at you every day, how can you ever value life?  His step father still walks this earth today but it was a close call, I came very close to doing something that would have ruined not only my life but my families lives too.  You may not have sympathy, you may not even have empathy, but until you have fought the fight, walked the walk, and lived the life, no man has the right to judge anyone else.  RIP John you will forever be in my heart! For the rest of you; never look down on anyone unless you are offering them a hand up!"

921975,manitoubass2,2015-06-27 19:23:00,11391,"Cliff, thats very tragic, but all too common.  I have addicts in my family on my wifes side. I do everything to help them. Feed them, take them fishing, got them jobs etc.  They are AWESOME PEOPLE, but just cant kick it. Sad really, theyve lost wives and kids.  But i know, im a prescribed addict. I know the struggle. I wont give up on them, just like you didnt.  And i have friends and family that dont give up on me. Amazing what love and understanding can do.  And just because someone is an addict(not directed at you cliff) doesnt mean they arent brilliant, great human beings?  Sorry for the loss cliff, it happens. Thats a tough on to swallow for sure.  But all we can do is be humane, when people struggle, help them out. Not even just with addictions either.  Help the old lady that cant cut her grass. Listen to the war vet get crap off his chest, listen to the child being bullied in school, listen to the gay boy/girl thats not accepted in school.

People hooked on narcotics taking what they think are light drugs are sold fentanyl instead and paying the ultimate price. These people are to be pitied not condemned Narcotic addiction is incredibly powerful and good people get hooked after taking these meds for pain. Sad but real.

I can understand your sentiment on drug users Fisherman; why or how people get started taking drugs, is the only place where I agree with you thou. Once they get hooked on the high from any type drug, they will take anything to get stoned; it's an addiction that for some; they just can't help themselves. I text my nephew as soon as I read the post; we have tried everything with this kid (he's 40 plus; but still a kid in my mind, that I remember holding when he was a baby) we and professionals cannot get him and keep him strait?

921774,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-26 07:44:00,8243,"Rick my sincerest condolences. I have lost a few friends through this horrid disease myself and empathize.  Addiction to anything is truly tragic. Anyone with an attitude concerning addiction like Fisherman has never had someone close to him suffers from this dreaded disease. It will eventually affect someone close to us all, it is all in the numbers. I have never known an addict that wanted to be an addict. Everyone equates an addict as the person that robs his or her grandmother of her CPP to score. I am an addict. I have been on opiates since my first knee surgery in 1978. As I continued to have pain countless other injuries the Tylenol 1's just did nothing then you graduate to 3's, then 4's then Oxycocet, then Codeine Contin, then higher doses of Codeine Contin with Oxycocet for break through pain, then another stronger opiate combined with Fentanyl patches. It's a never ending cycle. After 35 years you think I could just stop tomorrow? I don't think so. I have been weaning myself off the stuff for the last year under the supervision of my Physician. Now I'm back down to Tylenol #3. But I'm still an addict by definition. Many people I know got addicted while undergoing Cancer treatments, some lived some didn't. I imagine Fisherman has no sympathy for them either.  John F. Kennedy was addicted to Adderall, what an idiot he was, no sympathy from me."
