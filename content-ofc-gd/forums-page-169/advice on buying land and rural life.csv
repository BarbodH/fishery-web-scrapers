We rent a 3 bedroom 2 story house. A little ovee 800 per month including utilities  Im not rich by any means. In fact im on ei for the second time in my life right now. Wife works a good job. I worked the oilfields for abit(too tough on me and the kiddos).  Just be smart. My pops always told me, if you cant pay your bills on one weeks cheque, you cant afford it. For us thats a combined income but a very good strategy.  Do you by any chance live on manitoulin island?  Curious because of your username.  I will be camping out at Manitoulin resort on lake Manitoo at the end of this month."

The wife loves it to the point where she says ""lets buy one"".  They are more affordable and I must say nicer in Michigan for the price.  Why I haven't considered it yet?  Because I would love to own something here in Canada, plus I am sure buying something another country has its fair share of homework and strings attached, but that is a whole different topic."

921926,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-27 08:43:00,8243,"This thread has gotten me worked up and tighter than a drum. Well I had the laptop on the back deck and have been fooling around on it late because I haven't been sleeping very well and took a nap this afternoon that lasted about 5 hours. So here I am sitting on the deck and about an hour ago I hear splashing on the shoreline, I'm thinking maybe the Carp are back and don't pay much attention to it. About 45 minutes ago I realize those aren't Carp those are Smallies feeding on the Mayflies that are buzzing around my screen. Then I realize, this is after midnight, Bass season is OPEN. I grab a flashlight and grab a rod from the shed. Put a topwater on and gingerly head down the rocks to the beach. First cast, tug on the Rapalla Skitter Popper twice and fish on. It's pitch black out and she comes out of the water at least 4 times. I'm praying please don't spit it out, please I want to see how beautiful you are. About 2 minutes latter that feels like 30 minutes she is at the waters edge covered in green algae. I reach down and lip her hoping not to fill my hand with 6 hooks on 2 trebles as I can hardly see her. She is about 20 inches, 3 pounds maybe, normally I would tell you 4. I grab the light and I know I don't have any pliers. The back hook is in her lip maybe, maybe 1/4 inch. The hook comes out as smooth as a baby's bum. I admire her for a few seconds clean her off kiss her on the check and gently send her on her way, what a beautiful Bass, my favorite of the year.  I'm not moving anytime soon. I am going to sleep like a baby now.  Good Night and have fun if you are heading out for the opener, I will be back on the beach in a few hours if the wind and rain holds off. Not a bad opener1 cast 1 fish. I don't want to be greedy so I quit while ahead. Wowa we wa.  I love it here, again.  edit: clean her off, kiss her on the cheek and send her on her way, something I did in my 20's, but not with female fish! I know PG rated Speil. I can't help meself."
921930,Rod Caster,2015-06-27 12:21:00,5784,"Unorganized Township means there is no municipal government. If there is a community, there is often a Local Service Boards that administers/sets taxes on things like roads maintenance, community center, volunteer fire. Everything is run by volunteers. For small communities, it's the best government system because the townies run it and have a true interest in keeping costs low and service quality high. No waste of taxes on politicians or high-level managers or administration. Other than provinicial tax portions and school taxes, all the other tax dollar go directly to services. Awesome isn't it?  Unorganized Territory is an even higher level of unorganization. A lot of place far north have that designation."
921942,huzzsaba,2015-06-27 14:55:00,884,"Rod Caster $1000.00 per square foot for a pre fab? Where,  Malibu next door to Tom Cruise? Typo I think.  What many people don't realize a seasonal residential property if financed through a traditional mortgage the down payment is 30% or even higher depending on the lender.  Something that is funny was when friends of ours that came out to see us when we bought this place on the lake many years ago. John and Judy were here for a bit and Judy turned to John and said "" I want a place on the lake too John, I love this"" About 10 minutes latter when I was refilling libations I heard a blood curdling scream, I thought someone had been seriously injured. I ran to the deck and saw Judy with her hands over her head and violently shaking. She saw a spider. Needless to say she never visited again or bought a place near the lake.  Our taxes were $750.00 a year in 1996, they are now $4200.00. No sewer, no water, no snow clearing on private right of way, mail delivery a kilometer down the road. Garbage must be taken about 500 meters away on main road, efore 7AM because it will be strewn everywhere if the night before by coons and coyotes, no transportation services, no street lights, no side walks, 500 meter stone roadway you must clear of snow and repair (your newly washed car lasts newly washed for a few feet) no taxi service, no fast food delivery, heck no fast food for 40KM. Closest place to get an emergency quart of milk is a 15 minute drive, maybe an hour in a storm. The list of things one from the city takes for granted can become a real pain out here. Constant white outs and 6 foot high drifts, be prepared to miss some time if commuting to work, it will happen. Some nights spring and summer all lights must be off and TV off when sand flies and fish flies attach the cottage all might long. No snow removal on main roads until accumulation is over 20CM or something like that and then they have 24 hours to clear it, drifts along the lakeshore don't count. No newspaper delivery to the door, you will find it in a plastic bag in the snow only after it has been run over by a snow plow. Local news is a weekly paper, you will find out your neighbours funeral was 5 days ago. Zero local news because the local radio station is not powerful enough to reach your place and the closest city could care less unless there is civil unrest. Wake up one morning to the sight of 150 wind turbines, 3 of which are 600 meters from the cottage, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, 24 hours a day for 365 days a year. Hydro black outs, but only when it rains, gets windy or snows. Calling the Spiderman 3 times a year unless you want to wake up with a closed eye because a spider bit you. Call 911 and wait for 25 minutes (unless they are on another call) minimum and then there's the 25 minute drive to the hospital then wait for the emergency radiologist to drive the 50 minutes from home, unless it's snowing. Loose your license and man you have a problem. Not just from drinking and driving, what about due to diabetes etc?  I could go on but won't. Some of these things seem trivial but put 20 trivial things together and it can get tiring. The crazy thing is we may move away from the lake but I can never live in the city again unless it's a matter of health. Lol I think this pretty much sums it up!"
921954,crappieperchhunter,2015-06-27 15:50:00,2582,"On the upper Bruce there used to be a government program that if you had a minimum of 2 acres,I believe, and you agreed to not develop it in any way they paid your property taxes. We bought a chunk of bush between Johnson's Harbour and  Willow creek on the Huron side and we qualified for it, but never filled out the paperwork  because we where unsure what we where going to do with the parcel of land. Held onto it for a few years and then sold it when we decided to cottage in the Kawartha's instead.  Just thought I'd throw this up here for someone to consider and check into if they are interested."
922021,Rod Caster,2015-06-27 22:38:00,5784,"Same idea for the Managed Forest Tax Incentive Program MFTIP. If you own 10 acres of land or more, you can reduce your land taxes drastically by writing up a forest management plan and getting it approved by the MNR. If you don't plan on developing the all of the land, it's a great option and it's SUPER simple and painless."
922113,OhioFisherman,2015-06-28 16:22:00,6623,"I have no idea how your tax structure works up there, I live in a rural township here, it has zoning requirements, mobile homes are not allowed and there is a 3 acre minimum lot size to build a home. I live around 10 miles from a small city (population around 25k), if I moved there my property taxes would double to support multi-layers of government and city provided services. It never seemed worthwhile to me to pay around 400 bucks a month for a lot of services that I didn't really need or want.  We have 3 township trustees that run the townships business, they are part time, our police protection is thru the county sheriff's department and they do a good job, there is of course a fee included in our taxes, but lower than a full time police force would cost.  We have a fire station, new one built around 10 years ago, staffed by volunteer firemen and rescue squad, at a lower cost than a full time force, they also do a good job.  The township plows and repairs the roads, we have city water, septic systems, a community ballpark, cemetary, and not a lot else to pay for besides schools included in our tax bills.  Having the family on board is a big deal, especially over time, my daughters liked it here, until they grew breasts, then there wasn't enough excitement! LOL My son, now 26, still loves it here and still lives with me. I traded up, I got a dog and ditched the wife! LOL"
922172,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-28 20:17:00,8243,"Our propert taxes, here in Southern Ont. at least are based on assessed values done by an independent contractor every 10 or so years. Basically they take the most expensive house on the street or neighbourhood and the least expensive and the average is the value. Not much if any consideration is given for lack of services. The municipality will increase taxes annually based on where they sit after they have mismanaged the county. That is a simplification for sure but that how it basically works here in Haldimand county that borders the city of Hamilton, Lake Erie , Niagara, Brantford and Norfolk. The largest county in Southern Ont with only 45K residence. About an hours drive from one end to another N to s, E to W. That's a lot of county to maintain for 45K folks."
922293,OhioFisherman,2015-06-29 12:38:00,6623,"My county is a bit smaller Old, with around 4 times the population. They do our property taxes on assessed value too. As I recall they have a van that drives around with a camera mounted on top and take pictures, that also allows them to determine if you have built anything without the required permits."
922296,Rod Caster,2015-06-29 12:51:00,5784,"OI, a lot of small townships/communities are mismanaged in the same way. My inlaws live near Barry's Bay where they get literally no services and their taxes are like $4,000 for 35 acres. There are sand-floor homes, garbage-land properties and you bring your own garbage to the hole which is the dump. They are paying for salaries and administration of nothing, except highly marked-up road maintenance.  In my opinion, some of these smaller, very rural communities with high tax ratios and little to no services, should dissolve their municipal governments and operate under local services boards. Now mind you, that option may only be available in Northern Ontario..?? not sure about that. Also, it would require local leadership and volunteers... so good luck with that."
922526,huzzsaba,2015-06-30 18:25:00,884,"Thank you everyone for taking the time out and replying.  And thank you Old Ironmaker for your PM.  I am not one that likes to start a thread and leave it hanging but my laptop power cord decided to stop working leaving everyone at home to fight over one computer lol.  There is so much valuable information in this thread.  Basically after reading as much as I could, I feel the best route to consider is to buy something that will appreciate in value ie waterfront or riverfront property with a house on it already.  Use it during vacation times and rent it out to non party crowd when I am not using it.  Moving for long term would be tough for the time being due to schools and other medical amenities required by a family member.  I and the wife am pretty handy around the house so small repairs don't intimidate us once we get a place. I guess the last remaining concern would be the taxes vs appreciation vs usage or revenue.  In the end, like a lot of you mentioned, is to do my homework. I will have some time this summer so I will go look at some places and definitely do some research on my options. I definitely will be returning to this thread to look over the loads of advice as I go along.  Thanks!"

I have noticed though that I have a lot more to do in the new setting than my wife. Hunting and fishing are a walk or a short drive from the new house.  My wife on the other hand is lost at times unless I'm around. No neighbours!  She liked to walk with the neighbour next door.  The roads were paved and safe for walking, unlike the high, speed gravel roads in the country.  It was a great move for me and a pretty good move for my wife but I actually spend more time at home and less time hunting/fishing since my wife relies on my company to enjoy the country-side.

Maybe a 1000 a square for the foundation.  CPH, none of those little things bothered me 20 years ago as much as they do now. What really bothers me is the taxes. Taxed 4500 a month for exactly what is what I would like to know? We buy water, maintain and pay for the system to get the water into the cottage and then out againWhat's a pump I asked my country raised lady. Then  $175.00 to pump out the holding tank. Do not have any county services except uh,,,,,,,,,nothing but a roadway. Oh we have a library and of course you can't swing a cat without hitting a new arena, I actually like the kids now have world class facilities and don't mind paying for that a bit."

Lots of small towns...we are in and love Bobcaygeon.....with lots to offer and less of the negatives you are having grief  with.  I think small towns are a good balance between the madness of the GTA/Ham and the inconvenience of the boonies. A number of small towns along G. Bay from Owen Sound to Waub are quite civilized.

No sewer, no water, no snow clearing on private right of way, mail delivery a kilometer down the road. Garbage must be taken about 500 meters away on main road, efore 7AM because it will be strewn everywhere if the night before by coons and coyotes, no transportation services, no street lights, no side walks, 500 meter stone roadway you must clear of snow and repair (your newly washed car lasts newly washed for a few feet) no taxi service, no fast food delivery, heck no fast food for 40KM.  $4200 for taxes is insane. I'm paying 3 grand here in Grimsby for a small bungalow and there is a rumour they may actually go down this year. Got a hospital 5 minutes away, can see the lake looking down the street, launch ramp is 2 minutes away, of course all the sewers, water, snow removal, ( they even do the sidewalk often b4 the street), even still have a mailman delivering to the door. Think I would have bailed at the wind turbines."

I pay $300.00 a year to maintain my water supply (I do have a state of the art system though) get my septic system pumped about every two years ($185.00) and lord help me if the well craps out!  I love living on the lake but when we bought this place our taxes were $1600.00 a year. Our services were actually better than what we have today, but our taxes have more than doubled. Mind you, so have our property values but what does that really have to do with it? Just because I have worked hard to make my property better than the one next door my taxes go up and their's didn't?????"
921922,fishindevil,2015-06-27 06:58:00,6254,The pros of living in rural or country sure outweigh the cons that's for sure !!!! In my opinion anyways .....
921923,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-27 07:06:00,8243,"You are bang on Big Guy, we keep the property nice and the taxes go up, retirees buy a small cottage out here, tear it down and build a McMansion and MY taxes go up. The beef I have is the lack of any services. Add to my taxes the cost of hauling water and pumping the cistern out and you have to add another few thousand. And basically zero services in return, nothing. I forgot to add the cost of cutting down 2 huge Ash trees last year, add $2000.00, and that was a deal. We aren't talking a 3000 sqaure foot home here it's a bit more than 1000 sqft. and no garage. I just don't think the taxes are fair compared to urban life. Yes taxes are based on assessed value, but I think the assessed value is off because of the lack of services. Heck because we don't have public transportation the K's on the vehicles alone require far more maintenance.  Don't get me wrong I will never live in a big city again unless I absolutely must, but many don't consider how much more rural living really costs. I always hear "" Man, I can get a huge home in the sticks for pennies on the dollar compared to the city"", well add it up and it isn't that much less if anything."
921924,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-27 07:24:00,8243,"M2B2.  I don't think you will get your place here in Haldimand for double that price plus all utilities. In fact I know you won't. A small cottage down the lane is going for $1100.00 plus, it's 2 bedroom with a garden shed. It is waterfront though. a friend rents a 3 bedroom on a farm and the farm is worked by the owner. The house leaks like a sieve and he has to truck in propane and buy firewood and he pays $1500.00/mth. We were considering renting out Mom and Dad's place in the city when they moved into the retirement residence and the agent told us the rent would be around $1800.00 plus utilities. I wish we did, the same house would have brought another 50K a year latter, housing in Hamilton is booming. Sorry OP, hi jacking in progress, call 911."

921518,huzzsaba,2015-06-24 20:23:00,884,"I know many on this board live in rural areas and always wondered what it is like.  I would love to get out there and have a nice piece of land which would keep me busy, possibly one on the waterfront.  My wife however is not too keen on the idea of being away from civilization and I understand her point of view.  So what advice can you guys give me on buying land that is suited to build something down the line.  I am thinking maybe a small cottage for vacationing or to drive up to on my days off.  Maybe even to rent out for cottagers.  I guess my question is, is it worth it? My wife is totally fine with the a few days here and there out in rural areas but not long term.  Maybe buy a land and build something small.  What does it cost to build a small cottage? Maybe 1500 square foot 2 bedroom unit?  Maybe just buy something with a house already on it?  But the intention is to buy something fairly cheap cash and build something slowly when cash is available.   I know there is much more involved and would love to hear from you guys in this regards.  Thanks"
921521,ketchenany,2015-06-24 20:28:00,3229,"IF you buy something check the zoning carefully for now and in the future. I had place that was zoned agricultural and a stream, that stream was protected. It will stay that way for ever. No dividing, no house NOTHING. Doesn't appreciate much"

921531,chris.brock,2015-06-24 21:38:00,4053,In Haliburton the minimum is 850 square feet.  The price for land on desirable lakes in cottage country can be pretty high.  Renting the place out is definitely an option during the summer to bring in some money.

Barely doubled in value in 25 years. If they would have bought closure to the GTA and very small zoned residential or commercial they would have made millions. They stream ran into the Notty noth of 89 and it was locked could not even build a bridge across. I only saw Chubb in there but they insisted on other species!  Shop carefully and do your homework.  Also if you do buy make a profit later in life it's capital gains time. It's where I am now. On ther other hand I know people who have made millions buying and selling land.  Good luck."

921571,pics,2015-06-25 01:17:00,1268,Buying a rural property vs a cottage.. hmm.. depends on where you look and how far you want to drive as far as price goes.. a simple cottage can cost big bucks and not all rural property can be built on. Riverfront can be a much cheaper option.. having the  wife on board with any decision will make your life a whole lot easier ....

One thing to consider though would be to get a place somewhere near a small town. We live about 10 minutes drive to Lindsay which offers my wife all the medical, shopping, social requirements to keep her happy and I can catch fish off my dock and shoot turkeys from my garage if I want.  A simple walk across the road and there is plenty of hunting available."
921581,woodenboater,2015-06-25 02:28:00,2277,"If you buy land, take a look at unorganised townships. For the most part it's a free for all. Can't recall the downside to them, maybe no services like a dump etc..  I have acreage south of North Bay and it mostly wooded, softwood for the most part. It's not worth the hassle to rent it out as it's off grid and I'd prefer to let friends use it if they're in the area. It's primarily a ""get the hell out of the city and hear nothing and burn copious amounts of wood in the pit"" kind of property. Moose, deer and bear are around. Great skies and neighbours. and lots of blueberries, blackberries and raspberries.  Waterfront is another, more costly situation. I guess you have to decide if this is a long term strategy and how much you want to sink in it and if you see yourself retiring there. Healthcare being the primary issue for most thinking of living year round."
921582,SirCranksalot,2015-06-25 02:29:00,3291,"We moved to Wasaga after we retired and really enjoy it. Town is big enough to have most all the services and, contrary to what many might think, most all the town is quite quiet."
921593,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-25 05:06:00,8243,"Rent a few cottages for at least 2 weeks and your wife will either say I love this or I will see you latter. Asking what a 1500 sqft cottage costs is like asking how long is a rope? It all depends on what you want in it. Peel and stick floors tiles or marble, laminate counters or granite. It's never the wrong time to buy land in my opinion. If you are waiting for the prices to go down you will be waiting for life. I rented cottages in several different areas to see where I would like to be and most importantly if my wife enjoyed cottage living, I shopped for 20 years before I knew where I didn't want to be and what I could afford. Tich is from the country and did not want country life, but being on the water for her is different than being on a farm. I lived in the city for 40 years and always knew I wanted to be in the country. Now 20 years latter I am ready to go back to civilization. Too damp by the water, too cold in the winter (city cold winds and big lake cold winds are completely different) the Dr's office is an hours drive, way too much grass to cut and too much snow to clear. I can't do all the handy man stuff as easily now. If you are not handy you better buy new or build. You need to do your homework and this is a good place to start but the most important thing is knowing your budget and sticking to it. The main reason we bought where we are is the lack of traffic to get to Lake Erie, and the fishing. Most all of our neighbours are former cottage owners from TO that had cottages north and were sick of the drive, We are about 2 hours from Toronto and depending where you are would think you are up north. Some sold their places north and bought here for 1/2 the price for more cottage, most are homes now not really cottages, many now including us live here full time. That's another thing some counties will consider cottages seasonal residential and require you to be out for 6 months, it's not something they dare to challenge you on unless you are on deeded land. Another consideration is right of ways, no public access to your property, that can be a challenge.  Budget, budget that's what it's all about.  Good luck, you may need it."
921598,crappieperchhunter,2015-06-25 09:43:00,2582,"If the wife's not on board don't bother would be my short answer.  In the mean time do some homework  and rent a place for short trips together. Maybe she will ""get it"" after some exposure. And Big Cliff had some good advice about making it close to a small town. A short afternoon jaunt into civilization can be great for many reasons for the both of you.  Edit to add. Civilization must include but is not limited to a liquor/Beer store, a women clothing/shoe store, at least one decent restaurant and a Canadian Tire"

921646,Rod Caster,2015-06-25 16:16:00,5784,"Taxes in unorganized townships are going up this year and over the next several years. It won't be a ridiculous jump, but it'll be significant. All the northern municipalities with high taxes are blaming unorganized twps. for being a burden on their services... it's just tax envy from their own spending/salaries/mismanagement and since city services cannot be used by non-residents for free they really have no good reason for saying that... people in North Bay actually tell me I should pay them to use their roads hahaha..maybe I'll take all my business elsewhere then, and at the same time everyone from out of town should pay a toll to have the right to enter North Bay hahaha.  Anyway, what you are looking for will be very expensive and restrictive. Buy a property you can live and play on...much cheaper and more options to be had. As for the wife, I know a few people who their spouses said they need civilization, until they move to the country, then they say they could never leave. It's just a lifestyle change, but usually people get used to it. Be prepared to buy lots of screen for a porch/gazebo!!  Waterfront land will cost over 100,000 at the very least. Buiding a rentable place will be well over 100,000 and you still have septic, well, driveway, chattels, dock etc. A pre-fab is about $1,000/sq.ft installed (based on my local research). Lake front property is crazy expensive nowdays...on the plus side for those who buy now, it will likely keep going up in value."

My first choice by a large margin is unorganised lakeside. I was able to build my own place without any building permits,no building inspecter,just hydro & septic permits & inspections required. I did follow building code rules but was not subject to the whims of some local ""expert"" Living in the country with several acres is my second choice,but not a close second. I am about 10 minutes from a village with an LCBO,grocery store,medical clinic & gas station. I am about 30 minutes from the same small city Simon mentioned in his earlier post.
