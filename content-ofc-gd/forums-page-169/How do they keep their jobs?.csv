What a fiasco that was. Unions voted him in and then he turned around and decimated the work force with Ray Days. Legislated companies as ""Too large to fail"" that allowed corporations to raid pension funds of working people then those same workers find out the pension funds are no longer there when it their time to retire. It's not as bad now that it has been, not to say it's good, there are many levels of terrible. I know there are folks on this site that lost portions of their pensions or lost all of it."

How many of old timers share their nude pics with opposite sex in their pre-teen or even teens? Now with cell phone cameras in kids hand that is more common problem than one can think.. heck they even have a term for that called “sexting”.  How many of you participated in cyber-sex chats.. now that is stomping ground for child sex predators to lure the young child’s. That is just tip of ice burg. Sex education in this time and age is not limited to someone sexual orientation but also about educating what is out there and what is good or bad for kids.

It should be our right to decide for for ourselves as well as our children.    By the way, how did tree cutting and sign posting turn into this?  This should be more about a decades' worth of corruption, scandals, boondoggles and utter incompetent governance by the most oppressive, finger wagging, nanny statist pieces of crap this bankrupt province has and/or will ever see.

All were right under the hydro lines and in fact, most of them were already within a foot or two of the line. How much money has hydro just spent cutting treas away from hydro lines in Ontairo? Who is paying Hydro to do it? What idiot just approved the planting of all of these trees and how come they get to keep their job?  Driving up Hwy. 12; little village, speed sign 50 km/ph.... fifty yards further and clearly in sight 70 km/ph begins! Fifty yards past that another sign and clearly within sight, 80 km/ph begins. I can only wonder how much each of these signs cost, what it costs to install and how much do we spend maintaining them. Our tax dollars hard at work????????  Out in a rural area, no sidewalks, nothing much to walk to anyway there is a set of traffic lights with one of those nice walk/dont walk count down traffic lights. What idiot in there right mind got away with approving that? These people shouldn't have a job where they have the power to make decisions to spend our money! Who is their boss and why do they even have a job if they can't supervise their employees and make them accountable?  It is time for some accountability. Our seniors can go hungry, without heat, be told we have to start paying for our own medications because our government is running out of money but we can donate billions to other countries?  Billions get pissed up against the wall, senitors get charged, but no one is really ever held acountabile and now our members of parliment don't want to have to account for their expense claims? It's our money that they are spending for their lavish trips and if they do get caught they don't even get a slap on the wrist. Lets you and I try defrauding people and see what happens.

By who's standards?  Teaching little kids about masterbation, same sex relationships????? If I as an adult was to talk to a 12 or 14 year old girl about anything to do with sex I would be in jail so fast and I would be labeled a sexual devient!

922493,netminder,2015-06-30 14:25:00,514,"The Ontario Liberals are the most corrupt, wasteful and self-righteous group of politicians I've heard of for this province. I've only been voting for 10 years, so I don't have much to base this on, but I doubt many disagree. However...  Sex education needs to be in our schools. When I was in high school (grade 9 or 10), sex ed was taught by my gym teacher. I think he did a decent job, but it didn't teach me anything I didn't know. (use a rubber, diseases are a thing, etc.)  Sex ed needs to be updated. Children need to know the dangers of online sex. How accessible was the hardcore xxx stuff when you were a kid? Hell, even myself growing up through my teenage years with semi-early access to the internet I had to search hard. Now, with google and all those ""amateur"" free sites you can look at whatever you want, whenever you want and think it's normal and OK. I've spoken to girls my age (mid to late 20's), and they tell me that many guys my age have no idea how sex works, or think it goes something like you see in pornography.  People need to be comfortable with who they are. No one is forcing it on you, they're just asking that you accept it as reality. I occasionally get uncomfortable with gay culture, but no one is asking me to like it. The gay pride parade is simply bringing awareness to their cause. The same as all those cancer walks, etc. really don't put much money towards research, but do raise awareness. It's more of a party for like-minded people to get together and celebrate a society where this type of thing isn't (or shouldn't be) discriminated against. Would you rather it be like in Istanbul where they fired water cannons and tear gas to disperse the gay pride parade? http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/turkish-police-use-water-cannons-tear-gas-disperse-gay-pride-n383386  And finally, and probably on-topic, the trees are likely being planted along the side of the road to help block wind and drifting snow. It's been thrown around in Dufferin County to do the same, as it might make things safer. As for the hydro lines, well there's only so much real estate in the road allowance, and I doubt the farmers would be willing to give up their land to plant the trees."

This was on Markham Road below Steeles Ave in a well developed area, no farmers fields within miles and plenty of buildings to block any drifting snow. There was plenty of room on the oposite side of the road to plant the trees and no hydro lines to worry about. Where is the logic in that?  I've just watched Hydro spend most of last summer and the last three months already cutting trees and brush back from hydro lines. I can only imagine what that is costing us the tax payer."

You are the person to give the shirt off your back to someone that doesn't have one. But sometimes you come out with some opinions that even though I respect I have to shake my head at. We are of the same age and grew up at the same time. Do I want kids to grow up in a time similar to ours? I hope to hell not. I won't go into one of my lecturers diatribes but I will tell you this. I lived in the days where Mr. and Mrs. Cleaver lived across the street and we played with the little Beaver and Wally. I over heard Mrs. Cleaver tell the Beav when she didn't know I was in the driveway that she didn't want those dirty Italians playing on their side of the street because all the good Canadian neighbours will talk.  When the Police and Firefighters march in a parade what are they doing but showing how proud they are to be what they are? Do members of the Knights of Columbus join in a parade to try and make people believe in Roman Catholicism, or the Orangemen march to sway you to become Protestant? No they are showing that they are proud of who they are and what they represent. So what's the difference if someone marches in a Gay Pride parade? Not much.  Would I rather have my child today learn his or her sex ed. and the importance of respecting members of the opposite sex by a professional educator in school or learn it behind the steel scrap yard where pre teen and teen boys pay Joan Doe who turns out is mentally challenged a nickel to cop a feel?

922149,Big Cliff,2015-06-28 19:22:00,6899,"Johnny, not always agreeing with me is a good thing! Perhaps it is my age, up bringing, or just the fact that after putting in almost 40 hours of work in three days just to try to keep our heads above water I get a little too sensitive when I see the things that I mentioned in my OP.  I always welcome discussion as long as it stays civil and I am always open to listening to and trying to undestand other peopls point of views. Often I have learned from posting on this board that there are things I hadn't thought of prior to posting, I haven't always agreed but I do try hard to understand things from other peoples perspectives. Learning is good even at my age!  I choose to accept that some people, for what ever reason feel that it is their right to practice gay sex but I don't stand out on the street or up on stage going ""I am hetrosexual, how wonderful is that""? Perhaps that is why I resist when the Premier of our province thinks that her sexual orientation should be a priority and brodcast all over the world; just not very professional in my books!   Sometimes it is harder to say what is on your mind and leave yourself open to judgement by others than it is to keep your mouth shut and just go with the flow. The older I get the easier it is becoming to say what I do think which, if it is a problem then it is likely somebody elses problem LOL.  It has been a problem in Canada for way too long. We are so afraid of offending others that we would rather just keep our heads down and try to make everyone else happy. Believe me, one thing I have learned is; it doesn't work! If you don't say what you think then you are relying on others to say what they think and govern your life. Where would women be today if a few hadn't spoken out? Say what you think as long as you don't let it become personal!   Things have changed so much since I was a child, we didn't have the same level of communication that the kids have today, heck I can remember getting the National Geographic magazines so we could see pictures of bare breasts. OMG if you managed to score a Playboy magazine... oh you were the hero of all your buddies  These days it's hard to find a show on TV that doesn't show full frontal nudity and any child can get their fill of sex on the internet (regardless of what some of you parents think of your ""parental block"").Most 12 yearolds already know way more about sex than I did at 18 (in many cases they've already had more sex than I did at 18).  I guess I am old fasion and I still feel that a marrage should be between a man and a woman. I still believe that it is a man's responsibility to support and take care of his family and it is a woman's place to support her man and take care of her family. Their jobs might be different but their roles and responsibilities are equal and the same. I think that god gave us the equipment and the natural instincts we have today for a reason!  To me it is just part of nature, female fish lay eggs, male fish provide the sperm, it's how a species survives.  Oh WTH. If it makes you happy, just do it!"

I think the church has no business in either our government or schools. Even though I was raised Catholic my Mom would not let us go to the catholic schools that were a lot closer to us and most of my friends and cousins went to. The sexual preference of anyone in public should remain private. Anyone can celebrate anything they want, as long as not a single penny of my tax dollars support it. Yes any parade or festival will use my tax dollars somewhere down the line for extra policing etc. That incenses me. Just because I am a bit more tolerant of things like the choice of a woman to control her own right to life or otherwise to a Gay Pride parade for a baby boomer doesn't mean I think it is right to me morally or jives with my religious or political beliefs. I always like to play devils advocate in a civil manner.  M2B2, If there is indeed life after death I want to come back as my parents grandchildren or one of your kids.

I see many people in the public that shouldn't have kids; I'd rather rely on the schools to teach kids these things, than their lunatic, lazy, worthless parents. When I was in school, being gay was a bad thing and we were brutally mean to anyway who wasn't straight as an arrow... man were we mean and I regret it. My dad was a teacher and he had strong anti-gay attitudes as well!..not anymore.  The culture based on 'traditions' and religions is absolutely counter-intuitive, both to science and to society. I'd rather over-liberal weirdos over right-wing brainwashed idiots. I fall in the middle somewhere I think.  There is definitely waste in Government, and Hydro one drives me friggen nuts, but government also has a role in society as much as the economy.  I agree that financially this provincial government has screwed up big time and I'm personally feeling the pinch in taxes, higher rates etc. and will not vote for them next time (nor did I last time!). I can however, separate the financial failures from the positive gains in some circles of society and the environment.  The current federal government has been good to me financially, but they are creating a culture that I feel is anti-canadian and it's pisses me off so I won't vote for them either.  Life is hard to balance,there are a lot of things to get over and move-on from. I'm very happy with my life at home, so the things I can't control don't bother me so much.  Hear,hear!! Right on!!"
922238,Oggie,2015-06-29 01:23:00,588,"I taught biology to every high school grade for over 30 years.  Sex education was taught as part of sexual reproduction.  We dealt with reproduction in fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.  Humans are the same as most other vertebrates in that they have the same ""issues"" and orientations as other species.  What we're after in teaching this is tolerance and acceptance.  We're not teaching to push any particular viewpoint just a more inclusive society.  It's OK to be yourself regardless of your sexual orientation or identity.  Most parents don't have that discussion with their kids (I know I didn't). It's much easier dealing with the subject in a classroom where the kids feel more comfortable to comment and ask questions.  Has all this helped ....yes! The fact that the average post on this thread is tolerant suggests we are a more tolerant society. You should have heard my dad's views on these topics.  Fortunately I had teachers that opened my mind so I could decide for myself. "
922240,Christopheraaron,2015-06-29 01:28:00,3525,"Here's my view, and I'm not going to say any more because I may say something I'll regret. To everyone saying that it's not the government's place to instil morals on your kids, I will agree, to a point. However, when parents believe it is their right to teach children to discriminate, be it against a race, religion (or lack thereof), sexuality or anything else, all that can come of it is more closed minded thinking that only separates us all and causes other unacceptable behaviours that I'm sure no matter when you grew up would not be considered right if directed toward someone ""normal"", like yourself. I don't care for Wynn myself, but I'll say this, it is absolutely government's job to do what is best for each and every one of us and to make sure that we all live the best lives we can, the only way for us to accept each other is to recognize that not all people think the same. The amount of hate for people who are ""different"" I've seen in schools by kids at a young age is sickening and if parents aren't willing to raise their kids to respect others then what option does the government have but to at the least present the other side of the story; that others may not act or think like you, but in the end, we all live in the same country, we all fly the same flag, and we all bleed red, and that people should be judged only upon their actions, and not by who they are born as."

All of these law makers, politicians and other all knowing gurus that seem to know what is good for us all, should have spent more quality time with a fishing pole in their hands"

All of these law makers, politicians and other all knowing gurus that seem to know what is good for us all, should have spent more quality time with a fishing pole in their hands We'll never see the LGBT community outnumber everyone else, because it's simply not as common in nature as people who are straight. All that everyone behind this is pushing for is us to stop making such a big deal about it, whether you like it or not these sexual orientations have always been around, but it's funny, when we ostracized them and told them they were going to hell for being who they are you just didn't hear about it, strange right? These are PEOPLE we're talking about, and thinking they're any less human than others is a terrible thought. These relationships aren't being shoved in your face, do you notice when a man and a woman are together? I bet not, because we've accepted it as the norm, to truly accept others we must get used to seeing these things without reacting."
922254,Christopheraaron,2015-06-29 02:14:00,3525,"Chris are you sure your not in your 30's?  Lol Arthritis through my legs, working 5 days a week and arguing online, sure feels like it haha."
922259,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-29 02:45:00,8243,"If you think you feel you are the old age of 30 Chris what in hell are you going do when you are the ripe old age of 31? That hilarious Chris.  My mother who always said she wasn't prejudice is the most racist person I have ever known. She was born in New York City in 1932. She was raised by Italian immigrants in an Italian neighbourhood in Brooklyn that moved to the Buffalo area after WW2. I can tell you a hundred stories of how we were subliminally taught to be racists. For some miracle my 2 brothers and I are not. One story that sums it up. When I was in grade school the teacher asked the class "" What is your favorite nut to eat ?"" I replied "" N word toes."" I cringe typing it. I had no idea what that meant. My teacher did and kept me after school. In the 60's if you saw someone Black in Hamilton he played for the Tiger Cats. That is racist in itself but 99% true. My dad worked with a man at the steel plant that was Black and guess what? He was a former Ti-Cat. I can't believe we  didn't end up being card carrying members of the KKK, so it doesn't mean we all are a product of our environment, thank goodness. My Mother was just as bad as the racist woman across the street. Your hair would curl if I told you some of things my parents taught us. They were more than happy for us to bring a girl home when we were older as long as they weren't N word ers, slant I's, wet backs, paki, Nazi's or Jewish, Prodestant was OK because they all started out as Roman Catholic. It might be OK if they weren't Italian except northern Italians, that was the worse, don't ask me why. Man I can hardly type all that, my apologies to all my friends.  How in God's name did I survive her? Still am, she's 84 and still at it, bless her."
922266,manitoubass2,2015-06-29 02:59:00,11391,"OI Chris isnt near 30 lol.  Im the total opposite of you. My family was not racist at all.  When my gramps left the war his good friend and partner in the war was native. Hes smuggled back a dutch women.  He played hockey with my gramps and boy some of the looks(ive only heard through stories)  Later on I learned about racism in high school. Even then I never bought in. Again it was the natives, most hated them. But it was weird because wven the natives hated other natives from different reserves? Never really learned why? I know now as adults we travel from rez to rez for pow wows and everyone is super nice.  I dont know many asians up here, ive worked with some and same crap. Super nice people. Worked with french canadians, hard to work with but super nice people. Travelled europe, super nice people.  Just finished working a project about 9 montha ago and 3 guys were from africa. Probably the best dudes I worked with. Talk about a sense of humour and good food! I still message those guys for a laugh now and again  Like Chris said were all just people. No big deal"
922267,Christopheraaron,2015-06-29 03:05:00,3525,"That's just it, all of this hate is built into our culture, I don't blame anyone for having strong feelings about these matters, we've been raised on it."
921855,Big Cliff,2015-06-26 19:26:00,6899,"Driving through Scarborough the other day I saw all these beautiful trees just waiting to be planted along the side of the road, there were a couple of hundred of them, beautiful, straight, tall.  All were right under the hydro lines and in fact, most of them were already within a foot or two of the line. How much money has hydro just spent cutting treas away from hydro lines in Ontairo? Who is paying Hydro to do it? What idiot just approved the planting of all of these trees and how come they get to keep their job?  Driving up Hwy. 12; little village, speed sign 50 km/ph.... fifty yards further and clearly in sight 70 km/ph begins! Fifty yards past that another sign and clearly within sight, 80 km/ph begins. I can only wonder how much each of these signs cost, what it costs to install and how much do we spend maintaining them. Our tax dollars hard at work????????  Out in a rural area, no sidewalks, nothing much to walk to anyway there is a set of traffic lights with one of those nice walk/dont walk count down traffic lights. What idiot in there right mind got away with approving that? These people shouldn't have a job where they have the power to make decisions to spend our money! Who is their boss and why do they even have a job if they can't supervise their employees and make them accountable?  It is time for some accountability. Our seniors can go hungry, without heat, be told we have to start paying for our own medications because our government is running out of money but we can donate billions to other countries?  Billions get pissed up against the wall, senitors get charged, but no one is really ever held acountabile and now our members of parliment don't want to have to account for their expense claims? It's our money that they are spending for their lavish trips and if they do get caught they don't even get a slap on the wrist. Lets you and I try defrauding people and see what happens.  Lastly our wonderful Premier gets up on stage at the Gay Pride Paride and states "" I am Lesbien and the Permier of Ontario, how wonderful is that?"" I can only imagine what the out cry would be if I got up in front of thousands of people and said ""I am hetrosexual and I am a truck driver"". OMG I would be labeled sexist so fast!!!!!  I really don't care if she is lesbien but I do care that it seems to be her priority and now she is dictating that our children and grand children should be taught that this is a normal and acceptable thing? By who's standards?  Teaching little kids about masterbation, same sex relationships????? If I as an adult was to talk to a 12 or 14 year old girl about anything to do with sex I would be in jail so fast and I would be labeled a sexual devient! Strangly our wonderful Premier thinks it's ok for our teachers to do it? Not in my books, but how does she get away with it?  Sorry for the rant folks but I do find it frustrating!"

921869,mr blizzard,2015-06-26 20:52:00,1589,"Big Cliff , extremely well said and so truthful in everyway  Any premier is to represent the govt period, not to talk about sex, and yes some things that are being taught in schools now is mind bogeling.  If my teachers had talked about some of this stuff I would have gone to the school board , u are there for an education not someone elses views about what is sexualy right or wrong. Those are individual personal choices , not the educational system.  Many morals and values have been watered down so much over the years I can only wonder what some of the people who gave their lives fighting for this country would be thinking"
921870,dave524,2015-06-26 21:02:00,4508,"You must live close to my Brother, he watches them get pulled over all the time from his shop.  he has the auto body shop I suspect, I'm below the escarpment but watch my speed every time through there."
921872,Rod Caster,2015-06-26 21:11:00,5784,"Don't they say 1 in 10 people are gay? If that's true, and based on tv culture I'd say it is, then why not teach it in school? I see many people in the public that shouldn't have kids; I'd rather rely on the schools to teach kids these things, than their lunatic, lazy, worthless parents. When I was in school, being gay was a bad thing and we were brutally mean to anyway who wasn't straight as an arrow... man were we mean and I regret it. My dad was a teacher and he had strong anti-gay attitudes as well!..not anymore.  The culture based on 'traditions' and religions is absolutely counter-intuitive, both to science and to society. I'd rather over-liberal weirdos over right-wing brainwashed idiots. I fall in the middle somewhere I think.  There is definitely waste in Government, and Hydro one drives me friggen nuts, but government also has a role in society as much as the economy.  I agree that financially this provincial government has screwed up big time and I'm personally feeling the pinch in taxes, higher rates etc. and will not vote for them next time (nor did I last time!). I can however, separate the financial failures from the positive gains in some circles of society and the environment.  The current federal government has been good to me financially, but they are creating a culture that I feel is anti-canadian and it's pisses me off so I won't vote for them either.  Life is hard to balance,there are a lot of things to get over and move-on from. I'm very happy with my life at home, so the things I can't control don't bother me so much."
921875,Big Cliff,2015-06-26 21:22:00,6899,"I have many friends that are ""gay"", I have a 14 year old great grandaughter that has decided that she is lisbian and I love her to pieces. I don't go around saying ""I am hetrosexual"", they don't go around saying ""I am Gay"".  Each to their own but no one has the right to push their orientation on anyone else! Let me catch you trying to tell some 12 or 14 year old girl all about masterbation and sex and I will personally show you what I think about your attitude!!!!! You can do and be whatever you want to do and be but not when it comes to children!"
921878,wkrp,2015-06-26 21:36:00,656,Maybe its time for a Heterosexual  parade . Would  they let that happen. That would be discriminating wouldnt it. I also have gay friends and I respect them. Politicians would do anything for a vote. Slimebuckets.
921882,Big Cliff,2015-06-26 22:22:00,6899,"I would march in that parade.... Heck I'd even lead it and be PROUD to do it. We could call it the PROUD parade. I wonder if Wynne would support it, I wonder if Tory and his family would march with us?"
921892,Fishwilly,2015-06-27 00:22:00,206,I'm also at a loss for words....the world is gone sideways and it ain't ever gonna be right again. You can take that to the bank!!

921936,outllaw,2015-06-27 12:51:00,1232,agreed cliff.its not the world we grew up in now is it.
921943,craigdritchie,2015-06-27 15:03:00,1586,Of course it's screwed up Cliff. Liberals in power. What else would you expect?
921971,Joeytier,2015-06-27 19:09:00,3990,"How exactly are kids getting homosexuality forced on them??? By being taught that it exists, and that it's okay?  I guess you'd rather have educators, guidance counsellors etc remain silent about the topic and let those poor kids spend their entire adolescence confused and likely bullied and depressed?  Any idea how high the suicide rate is amongst homosexual teens, even in Canada?  Its scary high, and this hear nothing see nothing say nothing model of sex education in this country has a lot to do with it.  It's amazing the level of homophobia that is tolerated on this board.  And no I didn't vote liberal in the last election but I like to think I'm level headed enough to see this is a progressive move towards a more inclusive society.  One day my daughter will be taking part in these classes and I'm glad for it."
921981,Big Cliff,2015-06-27 19:49:00,6899,"So you are telling me that having some man talking to your 10 or 12 year old daughter about sex, masterbation, anal, oral.... sex is ok with you?  You do have a right to your sexual choices and beliefs in this country, in many others you would be stoned or whatever.  In Canada we tend to be tolerant but I believe it is a parents place to teach our children about these things and that no one else has the right to impose their views or standards on our families values.  I would love to see your reaction if some man came up to your 12 year old daughter or son on the street and decided to teach her/him all about sex! Well, it isn't my place to say, you might be alright with that! I sure wouldn't!  You know what though; good for you, at least you didn't vote Liberal!"
921984,Joeytier,2015-06-27 20:06:00,3990,"Try approaching an educator with that argument.  I know a few, and I'm sure they'd love to be likened to 'some guy on the street'.  No one is 'imposing' their views on anyone, merely educating.  I guess you don't believe in drug education either?  It's well documented around the world that societies with extensive sex-ed youth programs and more liberal views on sex in general have far lower STI and teen pregnancy rates.  I guess people hard facts don't mean much when your mind is sealed shut to new ideas."
921985,Big Cliff,2015-06-27 20:13:00,6899,So you are saying that a stranger talking to your kids about sex is ok with you? Each to their own!
922019,KraTToR,2015-06-27 22:04:00,506,"If you think this is bad, just imagine if we all voted NDP... It will be interesting to see what happens in Alberta.. I believe the culture out there is less tolerant than we are (Ontario) on such matters of sexuality.  Even though as a race we sometimes feel we've come so far, things like this show me how far we've yet to go.  To the OP, thanks for the refreshing perspective to what our current reality looks like.  Bravo."
922020,Terry,2015-06-27 22:34:00,14456,wait till you hear how much the Liberals are spending to put co-gender washrooms in the schools  for the boys that think they are girls and the girls that think they are boys  maybe its trans-gender   but you get the ideal
922024,Pigeontroller,2015-06-27 23:00:00,2793,You know what scares me more than the fear mongering redneck Bull in this thread?  I'm afraid some of you are going to vote for Harper in the fall!
922031,Weeds,2015-06-27 23:52:00,782,I think it's fair to make some distinction between teachers and strangers. It's not like you are going to let a stranger take your kid on a field trip. I see where you are coming from though Cliff.
922032,grimsbylander,2015-06-28 00:01:00,3016,"Change terrifies some people. Some react by quietly observing to see what happens next, hoping for the best. Others openly vocalize against the change by pointing out what might happen. Regardless it's not the topic that is the issue, it's the fact it's different. It's change. When you look around and your big beefs are how close together traffic signs are or trees planted near hydro lines, you should be smiling."
922035,moxie,2015-06-28 00:26:00,1566,"Why would they care? It isn't their money. And besides, there are no consequences. The provincial government is the largest employer in the province and therefore have the largest voting block in their hip pocket. Ontario; Home of the self serving public servant. What a travesty."
