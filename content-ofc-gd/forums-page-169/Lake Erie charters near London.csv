921190,DanD,2015-06-23 12:48:00,2223,"Here's a link to a few charter services around Long point and surrounding area.  http://www.longpoint.on.ca/site_sponsors.htm  You could also call the locale marinas around Port Stanley, Port Bruce and Port Burwell.  They're all apporx a half hour too an hour out of London.  Dan."

921206,10point,2015-06-23 13:41:00,165,"Thanks guys, are there any party boats where you go out with others? Would just be a couple of us so I'm looking to keep cost down. Just returned from a week of fishing in Ontario."
921210,G.mech,2015-06-23 14:01:00,830,"You could try Port Glasgow too, it is often better walleye and rainbow fishing early in the season.  The Bruce/Burwell action doesn't really heat up until later in July but being further West, Glasgow turns on mid June.  It is only 45 minutes from London, has a very nice marina, an is very close to the fishing grounds.  Scrimmy's Sportfishing was popular but he moved out west so I'm not sure who is running charters down there now but I know there is a few.  Here is a link to the marina who can likely help you out.  http://ontariomarinas.notjustfishing.com/portglasgow.shtml"
921215,Sandbag,2015-06-23 14:26:00,533,I can recommend Butcher Boy Charters in Erieau.  Will have you on Walleye and Rainbows on Lake Erie.  Cheers  Craig

921220,Old Ironmaker,2015-06-23 14:35:00,8243,"10 point. You won't find many ""party"" boats  here in Ontario. There is one that I know of that runs out of Port Dover of which the name eludes me. You have to understand this is Ontario, our government thinks we are too irresponsible to party. There are plenty of charters out of Ports, Burwell, Bruce and Stanley. I don't know anything about places west of Stanley."
