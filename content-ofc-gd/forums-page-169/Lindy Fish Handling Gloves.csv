922037,James77,2015-06-28 00:31:00,175,"Hey, I'm using one currently. It works really well. I use it on my left hand which is what I use to grab the fish. You only need one. The black portion on the glove is hookproof, and is the same material used to prevent law enforcement from hyperdermic needles. Protects most of your hand from the hooks and teeth. There are still vulnerable spots so you still have to be careful. You could basically lip a musky or walleye with these things.  Downside is they are hard to clean and will always have a ""musky"" smell."

This 43.5"" with a big ol' head on her inhaled his small bucktail, and would not open it's mouth... for some reason I didn't have jaw spreaders in the boat. So I put on the gloves, and pried open the mouth with my hands.  They work very well LOL.  The only real negative - as mentioned by James - they can get smelly and look a bit dorky in pictures. But from a safety perspective, awesome.    "
922335,fisherman7,2015-06-29 16:21:00,325,I use them all the time. When I come home from a trip I throw them in the laundry with the rest of my gear and hang them to dry. Then don't smell after that - till the next outing!
