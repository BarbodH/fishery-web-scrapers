Tops of the trees were just starting to flick thier leaves.    Then by 6am, I was in this.    Then by 7 am, I said uncle. 1/5-2 ft rollers.    I wasnt worried about any danger to myself, as the toon is great in this stuff. It,was my legs, They were getting tired of staying on spots. They were none stop flipping just to keep from being twisted and turned.  Few fish were caught on spinner baits and lost a tank that spit the bait as I was just about to grab the net.   I just rode the rollers in. Free ride.LOL  Sunday does not look any better, but if theres an opening, I,ll be back at it.  BASS SEASON IS NOW HERE.  So I guess the ole saying is true, but I was never a sailor.."
