You probably still won't have put you boat in the water by then anyway!!!!

922945,mr blizzard,2015-07-02 21:35:00,1589,"Did you check wholesale sports? Hi cram yes I did get ahold of them thanks, they said approx 3 weeks to get here as well,, did finally get my wife out today she can face the back and troll but I cant hold a rod out to the side while steering, a little to much strain yet on the rib muscles, but slowly getting better, she did not get any fish but she sure enjoyed being on the water finally"

921976,G.mech,2015-06-27 19:27:00,830,They are Salty down east holders I believe and they are bulletproof:  http://www.down-east.com/website_006.htm  Not exactly sure who sells them but they are available locally somewhere I'm sure (well maybe not in Yellowknife but somewhere....)

921978,G.mech,2015-06-27 19:38:00,830,"Im sure it,s not the one you seen  Those Orca's are really cool too and operate somewhat like the Salty's....Canadian Tire does sell them for about 50 bucks"

Not only for just rod holders, but when I want to drag a harnness and dont want to hold on to the rod. I know they are over kill, but what the hell."

921991,G.mech,2015-06-27 20:23:00,830,Canadian Tire sells them but you might have to order them in....51 bucks.   When you said you saw them 3 years ago it threw me a bit since I thought the Orca's were newer than that.....I guess I was wrong (again today)....they came out in 2012.

922013,KraTToR,2015-06-27 21:46:00,506,Its either the Scotty Orca (I have 2) or the Folbe.  The Folbe's are spendy but the best you can get.  They make this configuration in 2 sizes.  I use the Orcas for big trolling rods.. IE. Muskie.
922055,John Bacon,2015-06-28 02:14:00,3277,"Has anyone tried Orcas with Dipseys or in-line-planer boards on the bigs lakes for salmon, etc.?  I broke a Scotty Quick-Draw with an in-line planer  on Lake Ontario.  The Orcas may be a good replacement if it is tough enough."
922097,misfish,2015-06-28 14:35:00,29133,Another option John.  Never tried them.  
922101,Fisherpete,2015-06-28 14:51:00,1814,"I use the orcas for dispeys, they work great. Because your drag is not locked down like when muskie trolling there is not much stress on them even when a big king hits."
922131,cram,2015-06-28 17:52:00,1733,I picked up some Orcas from wholesalesports.com.  Good price and they actually had inventory (other places I checked didn't).

922224,Fisherpete,2015-06-28 23:43:00,1814,SAIL carries Orcas also.
922225,fishindevil,2015-06-28 23:53:00,6254,Yes the Scotty orcas !!!! They are the best that's the commercial I was in last fall !!! I used them and they are awesome !!!!   Thanks Chris !!!!

922443,Sinker,2015-06-30 01:50:00,8692,I like the down east salties better after using both types.  S.
922445,Pikeslayer,2015-06-30 02:00:00,1443,"I have never used the salties & am somewhere between a newbie & veteran fishing Salmon on LO. Have hooked and landed all my biggest fish on Orcas holding wire dipsey combos off both sides of the boat & lead core down the chute. If drags are set proper, you will never have an issue with the Orcas."
