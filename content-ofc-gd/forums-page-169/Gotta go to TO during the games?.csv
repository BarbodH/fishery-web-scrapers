922066,Dave Bailey,2015-06-28 05:04:00,1641,"no real reason to worry, nobody is coming to Toronto for the games.  2nd class event with 3rd class athletes  Wanna bet? But will certainly answer a question that most of us in the GTA ask at least once every day: Can Toronto area traffic get any worse?"
922072,Big Cliff,2015-06-28 10:20:00,6899,"I drive in and around Toronto a couple of days a week, I always have my radio on 680, they are usually very good about keeping you updated about trafic conditions."
922145,ketchenany,2015-06-28 19:09:00,3229,"Cliff I do the same BUT they always report on HIGHWAY traffic, UNLESS one of the major routes has an accident. NOtT everyone drives on the highway, me included.  There is an app that came out and it shows where traffic is/will be backed up! Right  The other night I approached Dufferin along Steels, just crawling, ok it's raining, fine get to Keele same thing approach the subway construction, here is a guy in the left lane stopped with his 4way siting in the SUV, across the street two I say two paid officer sitting around waiting for some construction equipment to cross so they can stop traffic. WHY in the (bad word) didn't they just push him 10 feet off the road! AND clear the problem! can't do that with the money they are being paid I guess."

Would not have believed it if I had not seen it myself,  I drive a ton around the city and the police are the worse, I under stand and agree that they have to pull people over but why do they stay to do the paper work before they move on,"
