1064543,Lostchild,2020-08-01 14:36:00,153,"I have a brand new 14ft Smokercraft¬†wide/deep tiller with a 2008 30hp¬†4 stroke Mercury.¬† It is pretty much a bare bones boat, no flooring or livewell. I get 28mph top speed trimmed out and can troll down to 1.98mph on calm water. When by myself I do have a slight lean to the right, which I find is normal for most smaller boats, I compensate for the lean by putting my battery and gas tank to the opposite side. I would question your theory of the foam being saturated, I am not sure but wouldn't they of used closed foam which wouldn't absorb water? And if not then I would think that all the foam thru out the boat would be saturated from the water leeching thru, not just the one side?  "
1064559,Raycaster,2020-08-02 13:43:00,528,"From what I have seen from other older boats is that the Expanding foam Injected eventually will become saturated if soaked for a long time. I am not 100% sure on my boat frame but most are sectioned off for strength underneath. This is all speculation as I have not seen any build pics or info. I may take a peak in the winter as shifting everything in the boat to the left side still doesn‚Äôt level the boat even with a full live well, 2 27 batteries and 80 minn Kota on the left side. I do realize the boat is shallow so even if the foam is soaked on the right side it shouldn‚Äôt be a huge weight but given there is only one console and starboard has a wider gunwale the boat would have a natural starboard tilt especially with a 200lb driver. If bored I may cut a bit in the winter for a peek. Secondly patching the front right hole inside would be reassuring for the next year. "
1064570,John Bacon,2020-08-02 16:27:00,3277,"I found a piece of foam that had come loose and was sitting in the bilge on my 1994 Alumicraft.¬† It sank, so I don't think the foam was of much use.¬† The entire boat sank not too long after that.  	I have been told the newer boats use better foam. "
1064571,cisco,2020-08-02 16:33:00,597,looking at the hull pics and hearing how you have been compensating like crazy it occurred to me that the hull has been bent/reshaped/twisted to push it up on one side thus changing¬†the flotation and planing abilities on that¬†side.
1064572,Ralph Zettler,2020-08-02 16:36:00,10,"My Legend is a 2000 15' Prosport 40 4stroke¬† when I replaced the floor and put vinyl down there was no flotation on the floor just blocks at the rear ,ahead of the bait well and up at the bow bench seat In hind site I should have put close cell foam board in the floor which is probably next on my list As to your listing prob my boat also lists but to the port side with a passenger Kind of used to it now    "
1064573,cisco,2020-08-02 16:45:00,597,"BTW a great way acc to some boat build forums to provide flotation is to install a bunch of various-sized cleaned out and capped plastic motor oil jugs.¬† Easy to install, cheap, light and effective."

1065153,Raycaster,2020-08-21 14:45:00,528,"Update. Took a peek and drilled a 2‚Äù circle in the storage floor. 1) Foam not saturated. 	2) Floor frame makes it almost impossible to remove and fix any cracks. 3) Removing engine, flipping hull over and aluminum brazing any ¬†Hull crack is the only real option. The thought of removing foam to get at any cracks is a non-starter. Do able but so is building an Egyptian pyramid. The boat only had a few cups of water in it after a week in the water, not enough even to use bilge. The epoxy patch seems fine for now and if needs yearly touchups its acceptable. The main problem of the lean is probably as most have mentioned caused by the console and fat driver on the right side in a basically oversized jonboat. The cutout is being properly fixed with marine adhesive and rivets.  "
1065367,Lostchild,2020-09-01 15:35:00,153,I meant to mention those 2¬†spare wires you have on the motor maybe for a rpm gauge or possibly a trim gauge???
1065369,Raycaster,2020-09-01 15:50:00,528,"LostChild, the color is aged but tan/brown seems to be a trim guage wire. I have left them unattached as the engines has been running perfect. Every bit of logic points to them being connected together but until I see a tech give me the ok I will leave well enough alone. The trim Control on the engine and on the throttle work 100% and I dont have a trim guage on my console so I black taped them apart. "
1065419,JMFJMF,2020-09-03 00:52:00,18,"I had the same problem on a 16 ft Cutter pushed by a 70HP Evinrude, and for years couldn't find the cure. (I received a lot of useless advice including from licensed and experienced boat mechanics who made me change the prop, add a planing wing, move the battery and gas tanks, etc). Until one day I discovered by pure chance that by trimming out the engine (which did not have power trim, just a pin) by 3 positions the problem was fully resolved. I encountered this again on another boat and sure enough the same remedy worked on it too."
1065420,AKRISONER,2020-09-03 02:46:00,5558,"lol if only my boats problems could be fixed by me dieting and exercising....*sigh* that little leak doesnt even count. My tinner even brand new also always managed to get a little bit of water in it after a week on the water and I know for certain it wasnt leaking, I think the majority of it simply came from when you land fish, wet nets, morning dew¬†etc etc."

1064337,Raycaster,2020-07-26 17:14:00,528,"I ended up with a used 2003 Legend Xcite 164 (16ft Aluminum) this summer and fairly happy. Of course with all used boats there are expected problems and mine is that the boat leans to starboard pretty good. I have 2 trolling batteries (27s) in the front left and try to pile everything to counter the lean but its still prominent. Nothing looked out of whack on the boat or hull and beside my 200lb¬† I could never figure out the tilt.  Well, I may have found it. I usually try to balance the boat and even sit on the edge of the seat to flatten out boat but flying out the other day I just put up with the lean and flew out towards the skyway. Half way there I noticed I was taking on an unusual amount of water. Long story short, went home , filled boat with some water to test and notice a slight leak along a bend in the front starboard side.Repaired with Marine JBWeld (I know not permanent) but looks decent. Okay, story getting long... My main reason to post this is does anyone support my reasoning that due to this gash the foam has become waterlogged on the starboard side causing the tilt? I've heard waterlogged foam can add 100 or 200lbs easily. Nothing else with the boat structure looks like it would cause the tilt so this may be it? Now the million dollar question... Has anyone dismantled a 2003 16' legend to get at the foam? The one thing that I really liked about the boat is the floor is screwed in (very few rivets) and all metal besides tops. It looks like I can be done over the winter but having someone that has done this already would give me some confidence it can be done. The boat is bone dry right now in the driveway but I think 90% of all articles I have read say only ripping it out will fix it and 1000 fans won't do it.  "
1064338,lew,2020-07-26 17:35:00,12766,A 16' Legend isn't a very big boat and if your in the boat by yourself your 200lbs will definitely throw the boat over to the right side. It could very well be wet foam but I'm guessing it may just be your own weight all on one side plus the added weight of the steering console that's causing the issue.
1064339,leaf4,2020-07-26 17:36:00,2466,I have a similar boat (06) with a similar problem but I don't take on much water that I'm aware of. Had it sitting for a week up at the cottage and every day was dry. But the lean is very prominent. Gas and battery go on the opposite side.
1064344,Raycaster,2020-07-26 18:28:00,528,"Thank you for replies guys. OK, I won't tackle that right away and will see if the ""fix"" settles things. Yes, I should of mentioned the XCite 164 is not a Deep V boat so not much depth under floor for sure. Also didn't mention I usually have livewell empty (port side) which would add weight also for balance. The Legend does look like the floor is removable as the center metal panel is accessible. I could remove that but boat lower frame may block off from each side probably. I could easily just cut a nice square patch out of the front starboard storage floor to look below, its directly above fixed leak. Big thanks to members here as hearing someone with comparable situations or experience can REALLY calm a ""New to Me"" boat owner."
1064347,dave524,2020-07-26 19:10:00,4508,"The torque of the motor naturally causes a boat to lean to the left/port under power , that is why they are set up with the driver's seat on the right /starboard to offset this, does it level out under power ?"
1064348,Raycaster,2020-07-26 19:44:00,528,No it does not level out unless an adult sit front port side. Moving battery to port side really isn't an option as the gas tank sit back port side. Would love to move main battery to front storage but wiring might be prohibitive. I probably will move trolling motor to left but probably not a huge change as the head balances it out.  
1064360,cisco,2020-07-26 22:26:00,597,Try it with the livewell full. Maybe the design is taking this into account. I'd sure try this before removing the floors and foam.
1064376,Garnet,2020-07-27 10:49:00,2056,You could run your trolling motor off other side.
1064377,misfish,2020-07-27 11:00:00,29133,"With a crack like that,I would say the foam is saturated. Who knows how long it,s been like that. "
1064381,Cast-Away,2020-07-27 13:12:00,790,"I have my 2000 17"" Legend taken apart at a marina last fall to have 11 rivets replaced. I was told up front that cutting out the old floatation will be a big part of the labour because it is spray foam which adheres to the honeycomb pattern of supports under the hull. The total bill was $5,000 which included replacing the floatation foam, flooring and carpet. There was 90 hours of labour in total. I know yours is a crack and not rivets but just giving you an idea of what was involved."
1064383,Raycaster,2020-07-27 13:34:00,528,"MisFish I totally agree that I have no idea how long that hole has been there. The previous owner warned me that it had a tilt but its still 50/50 if he knew about the damage. A more diligent buyer would of seen that but its a lesson learned and no use dwelling on it. Cast-Away thanks for the heads up. The floor and console look removable easily enough if it gets worse or I get bored. I'm heading to Balsam for a week in August with the boat in the water for a week. That will help the decision also as sitting in the water may highlight any other problem or if my patch was unsuccessful. The front right storage is directly above the patch so I would be able to get at the area (cut square patch out) and remove insulation from that pocket and patch from inside. I will keep an eye on it, drive with a full livewell and switch trolling motor side. I think Lew's suggestion that there really isn't a ton of foam down there to cause a massive weight shift and Leaf4 noting that this lean may be design related and normal will slow down my attack mode of pulling the boat apart asap and I will wait and see. The Balsam trip may provide some answers. Thanks to everyone for the input."
1064385,lew,2020-07-27 14:09:00,12766,"Sorry Raycaster but that's not what I was implying, I was just suggesting on smaller side console boats that one person sitting behind the wheel will definitely cause it to lean that way. My Bro in Law had a similar size Legend and it leaned like yours from Day 1."
1064391,leaf4,2020-07-27 16:06:00,2466,"I'm surprised with the amount of battery you have in there running a 25. I am desperately wanting to swap the 25 for a 50 because I can reach max of 20mph in it, less with the trolling motor and battery in the front. In the middle of upgrading to a larger house so don't feel like shelling out the cash for one at the moment when I know I'll have a bunch of moving expenses lol"
1064395,Raycaster,2020-07-27 16:38:00,528,"I'm getting 22mph max on calm water, 20 with a passenger. Compared with my old pontoon with a 30hp I am lightning fast now! The boat has a Canadian rating of 40hp max and US 50hp max. I may grumble later but coming from a old pontoon boat I'm happy with the speed. I may get 2 more batteries for the trolling motor as the 80 Minn Kota lasts about 90mins at 2.2-2.4mph for trolling on Lake Ontario. There is a battery tray between the 2 middle storage (under pedestal support) so maybe 1 there and 1 to the left side of the front middle storage. "
1064396,leaf4,2020-07-27 16:43:00,2466,"That's funny, I have a 50hp rating for Canada and 55 for the US. And yeah I'm typically 20 with a passenger, I've been up to 24 but that was an empty boat just emergency gear and myself lol. Still not fast enough I'd like to get 30-35 as some areas of quinte I fish there's opportunity to go far depending on what I'm targeting."
1064412,John Bacon,2020-07-27 22:32:00,3277,How old are the batteries?¬† 90 minutes seems pretty short even at high power.
1064413,Terry,2020-07-27 22:50:00,14456,"The term Trolling motor is really a misnomer for electric motors, they were made more a positioning motors. ¬†Your little¬†outboard should troll as slow as you need and use very little fuel at those speeds"
1064414,Raycaster,2020-07-27 23:05:00,528,The 27s are 2016 and I think 90 minutes is about right as its probably pulling close to 50Amps at 8 or 9. On can go a whole week on Balsam just holding position etc. but keeping between 2.2 and 3mph on Lake Ontario does pull some juice. I find my 25hp struggles to stay under 3mph but I'm just still learning the ins and outs of the boat. Actual used a drift sock last time out to slow down. 
1064415,Terry,2020-07-27 23:09:00,14456,Wow a 25 should troll under 2 mph all¬†day long i think it needs¬†a tune up
1064416,Raycaster,2020-07-27 23:57:00,528,"Terry you are probably 100% right. When I got it I replaced plugs, oil, oil filter, lower gear oil and fuel filter. Haven't done impeller but its on my list. A tech tuneup in the fall is probably a great idea. I still never resolved the disconnected 2 wires but that's a different thread and that tech tuneup would fix that too. BTW, Its a 2004 Mercury 25hp 4 Stroke Big Foot. I only have had a 1982 Yamaha 30hp 2 Stroke to compare.  "
1064423,cisco,2020-07-28 01:32:00,597,After reading Lew's post that his relative had same issue from new with a similar boat you should do as stated above to see if it's a design thing. A livewell full is a couple hundred pounds. And your live well is on the high side. When full it simply has to make the boat more level.
1064424,misfish,2020-07-28 08:50:00,29133,"For sure like Terry said,you should be trolling easy at 2 mph even less I would think with a 4 stroke."
1064425,Garnet,2020-07-28 11:42:00,2056,Trim your motor up when trolling to slow it down. Keep eye on water pressure. My old Mariner turned pee'r upside down getting a little height on water so I could hear it and see with sideways glance. Had a 175 Rude same thing.
1064426,Raycaster,2020-07-28 12:08:00,528,"Trim motor up, of course! Will watch water pressure for sure Thank you. You guys are awesome. "
