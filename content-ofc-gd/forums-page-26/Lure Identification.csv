1065409,akaShag,2020-09-02 16:30:00,2073,"Good luck finding the replacement tails.Â  They were a PITA and I am guessing most folks threw them out, like I did..............."
1065425,OhioFisherman,2020-09-03 12:46:00,6623,"Just my take on that lure? a soft tail lip less crank bait, in waters with a lot of toothy fish that could be an issue."
1065426,akaShag,2020-09-03 12:48:00,2073,"And the plastic replacement tails were hard to find, generally not available in colours one would use, and they dried out quickly, even in a sealed bag.Â  On the other hand, the wet lure tail turned almost slimy..............."
1065432,akaShag,2020-09-03 13:50:00,2073,Sounds like you and I had similar experiences with them..............ðŸ˜‰ Doug
1065437,OhioFisherman,2020-09-03 15:02:00,6623,"LOL, Doug, fortunately that was an experience I managed to miss! Looking at some of the pricey hard baits with soft plastic tails like the s waver just makes me wonder? They aren't much good without the tail? and only the mfg has the tails?"
1065467,akaShag,2020-09-03 21:41:00,2073,"I am not familiar with any modern lures of this design, but yes that was surely the case with the Power Rattle.Â  It was pricey and had the negative issues I mentioned earlier.Â  I had TWO of them (different colours of course) and threw them both out years ago. And FWIW I do not recall them being particularly effective.Â  In my memory, an original floating Rapala or a white Big O fished the pants off the Power Rattle in the same body of water at the same time. Doug PS)Â  Then I really re-discovered jigs (and jig-like techniques like Texas rigged worms) and never looked back...................."
1065551,OhioFisherman,2020-09-05 23:09:00,6623,"https://discounttackle.com/products/river2sea-s-waver-120 not exactly the same design, but the same future issue possible with finding a replacement tail? I have caught a lot of fish on lipless crankbaits just never saw a need for one with a soft tail, and even with the hard bait ones on any given day one by one mfg might work better than one by a different mfg. Jigs and worms!"
