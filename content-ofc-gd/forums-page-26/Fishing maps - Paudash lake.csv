870686,Master of Bait,2014-09-04 13:58:00,196,"Hi folks,  I'm fishing Paudash Lake next weekend - competing in a friendly tourney with some buddies.  I'm looking for a map (adventure maps style) and I wonder if I can pick something up in/around Toronto rather than sending for it in the mail.  Any suggestions?  Alternatively, if anyone has sent out for a map, what was your experience like, with turnaround time, etc.?  Also, if anyone has any bass fishing tips for Paudash in mid-September, I'm all ears!  As a matter of fish porn, I traveled to New Brunswick in July to visit family and caught some striped bass, right off the beach(!), using mackerel chunks at night with a rising tide.  Not to worry, I ran inside to take this pic then ran back out and released this guy - he was in great shape.  Cheers,  MoB    "

1009948,johnbug,2017-07-26 19:38:00,2,Thanks. How do I view the map with the fishing spots?
1009957,OhioFisherman,2017-07-26 22:04:00,6623,"  It's another good looking Canadian lake, just from the boat tour video I see spots I would be trying for bass."
1009960,fishindevil,2017-07-26 22:24:00,6254,I have spent many hours on paudash lake and have done very well in the past....
1009965,Pikeslayer,2017-07-26 23:00:00,1443,"1. Launch your boat and seek out other fisherman on the water. Anchor right beside them and ask them; What are you catching? What baits are best? Don't have one? Ask them for their spare. Where are the best spots on this lake? Do you have GPS waypoints?What are the best times of day? When you're done with the first boat, mark the waypoint and move on to the next and repeat. 2. If there's only a few boats on the water, look for docks with really nice fishing boats tied up. Tie off at the dock and walk up to the cottage and knock on the door. Ask all the questions above. Also a good time to ask to use their bathroom.  Will sure make life much more convenient for yourself?  p.s. All the fishing spots in the map posted are clearly marked in blue. You just need to look a little harder."
