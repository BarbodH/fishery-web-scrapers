1065181,misfish,2020-08-23 16:17:00,29133,"All these years of saying never,I decided to get my first tat. My youngest son has reached his certification to do ink work. He has been working at it for a long time. A friend of his that has been doing it for many long years, took him under his fin and has coached him. He is now part of the company . He does all his own drawings and has these crazy apps that I have no idea how to use. Today was the out lay. 3 weeks from now he will start the coloring. This is on my casting and drift arm.  Chasing tails. There will be water drops and a splash around the tail when he starts the coloring . Looking forward to the finished art work .    "

1065185,TJQ,2020-08-23 16:40:00,7806,LOL.. love it!
1065186,joeybacala,2020-08-23 16:45:00,63,I always say the same thing. Actually it was a promise I made my dad when I was younger to respect the wishes of the house.Â  I will say though when done wellÂ it is beautiful.Â  Congrats on the tattoo and much success to your son.
1065187,Terry,2020-08-23 16:53:00,14456,We use to line up and pay at the carnival to see that tattooed lady now they are everywhere
1065188,misfish,2020-08-23 17:03:00,29133,"Oh I still have to deal with me mudder when she see,s it."
1065189,misfish,2020-08-23 17:03:00,29133,"Look,don't touch.LOL"
1065190,shanty gord,2020-08-23 17:17:00,16,Never say never lol. Canâ€™t wait to see it finished. Thatâ€™s really cool that it is done by your son
1065192,Fisherman,2020-08-23 18:08:00,7201,"I remember about 10 years ago my boss said he saw this real cute woman at the beach and as she walked by saw her tattoo across her back about lower bikini height.Â  He wasn't quite sure what the tattoo represented but came to the conclusion when that same woman becomes about 50 years old, the tattoo would resemble an octopus boinking a starfish.Â  I just about pee'd my pants.Â Â  So true."
1065194,joeybacala,2020-08-23 21:05:00,63,Have fun with that.Â ðŸ˜€

Very easy to remember when I got my 1st tattoo, myself and my 3 buds went up to the Navy recruiting office at Young & St. Clair and joined the Navy then drove down to Jarvis & Dundas and all got tattooed. While we were sitting in the tat shop it came over the radio that JFK had just been shot. Nov. 22 1963 Long time ago now."

1065199,Streamhound,2020-08-23 22:39:00,36,I love my Brookies but not enough to get inked
1065200,glen,2020-08-23 23:31:00,2641,No problem getting a tattoo. Â If you donâ€™t like it you can get it removed. Iâ€™m not sure how they removeÂ it thoughÂ Â Â Â might be a belt sander.Â  	I saw one that was a giant pickerel across a guys back. Â If it was real it would have been a 25lber.
1065201,grimsbylander,2020-08-24 00:50:00,3016,Depends when he got it. If I got a 6 lbâ€™r across my back when I was 16 it would be a 25 lbâ€™r now!
1065222,akaShag,2020-08-25 13:10:00,2073,Wear long sleeves.Â  Like wearing a turtle neck sweater when you were a teenager to hide the hickies..............
1065229,Headhunter,2020-08-25 18:35:00,5703,"Well Brian, should ever question yourself why I'm freezing my arse off catching nothing, you now have a permanent reminder! Glad your happy with it, personally, I have enough troubles with the orifices I was born with, to add thousands more! HH"
1065241,Old Ironmaker,2020-08-26 01:04:00,8243,I have thought about it. But why would anyone try and go beyond perfection? My ex wifes grand Dad who fought bravely I'm sure in WW1 was tattooed from neck to navel. And at 90 something was proud to show anyone. Some things you just can't unsee. I'm sure some ink that looks great at 21 not so great at 71. deleted
1065243,akaShag,2020-08-26 01:08:00,2073,"Here's one for you, OIM. Doug "
1065244,Old Ironmaker,2020-08-26 01:16:00,8243,"Ahh thanks Shag. Another one I can't unsee. I can't imagine what a woman would think the 1st time the guy took his shirt off. Or it might be a she, or one of the letters of that long acronym."
