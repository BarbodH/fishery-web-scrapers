1065086,DRIFTER_016,2020-08-19 01:49:00,10439,Haven't been there in many years but I used to use the town launch right in Honey Harbour. Just looked on Google Earth and I don't even recognize the place anymore. Can't even figure out where the town dock/launch is. There's marinas everywhere. Life was better before all this development. Looks like it's still there Honey Harbour Park Landing is the name of the place. Lots and lots of Marinas with launches too.
1065088,irishfield,2020-08-19 02:09:00,26272,All I know for sure is the launch across the the beer store/school is gone.. 
1065089,DRIFTER_016,2020-08-19 02:24:00,10439,That's the one I used to use. Looks like it's still there on the map.

1065094,AKRISONER,2020-08-19 11:32:00,5558,Yup the place is completely developed out the ying yang now. I don’t believe there is a public launch/parking anymore. hence the ask. Some marinas are also stupid with their launching prices. I expect to pay $20 even $30 but I’ve seen ridiculous crap like $50+ which I’m just not willing to pay to launch and park for a day
1065097,BillM,2020-08-19 14:57:00,17367,"Public ramp is still there, been closed for a looong time.   Launch at Village.   $20, with the high water the ramp is basically gone however, bring your rubber boots."
