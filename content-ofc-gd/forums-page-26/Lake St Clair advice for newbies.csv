Canadian side and waters only please. No passport Any tips at all would be great. Never been and hope to get into some really nice fish
1065065,glen,2020-08-18 15:12:00,2641,Do you have gear for monsters?   Did you see my post?
1065066,LeXXington,2020-08-18 15:15:00,1928,Try fishing for Walleye .. always works for my monster musky
1065076,outllaw,2020-08-18 21:28:00,1232,hi try east of belle river. bucktails from handlebarz baits are working well. try trolling them..run a 5 ox weight inline ahead a 5ft leader troll at 3.9-4.1. for cranks run them up hi in the top 7ft at same speeds. good luck be safe..
1065085,Rizzo,2020-08-19 01:46:00,4754,what he said. Bring a big net and make sure you have heavy enough gear. Fish stress easy in warm water. fortunately these cool nights should be helping. You can also launch at Lighthouse cove and basically troll the whole way to Belle...been there done that
