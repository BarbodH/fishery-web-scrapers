1065075,Old Ironmaker,2020-08-18 21:21:00,8243,"You have special skills there Spiel. I'm not sure what you are building but I know it will be great when you are finished. The most expensive rod I have was around 100 bucks and I won that in The Stelco Fishing Club draw many, many years ago so I'm not a customer but an admirer."

1065092,smitty55,2020-08-19 03:35:00,928,OI If I have it right that's the butt section of a fly rod in Speckled Trout pattern. You can see where the reel mounts in the bottom. Spiel I'm just curious as to that wire running through. Is it just for hanging? Lovely work btw.
1065095,Spiel,2020-08-19 12:29:00,9065,"Thank you Sir.  	Yes the wire is just for hanging after clear coating. And the rod is a light 2 piece spinning rod, the reel seat and the fore grip were made to appear to be seamless in design. "

1065099,akaShag,2020-08-19 15:09:00,2073,Looking forward to seeing pics of the finished product!  It looks awesome. Doug
1065100,LeXXington,2020-08-19 15:47:00,1928,wow! nice work
1065113,grimsbylander,2020-08-19 21:58:00,3016,Beautiful Spiel. Did you mount the part in the cross slide so you could use the chuck to rotate the form cutter?
1065116,Old Ironmaker,2020-08-20 01:13:00,8243,"A spinning rod. I would be afraid to use it in case I scratch the thing. It was the wire that threw me too Smitty. Chris, I ran into Jim McK*&$ a few weeks back. He said to say Hi. He hasn't changed much. I think you may remember him from our office."
1065119,ketchenany,2020-08-20 10:43:00,3229,Beautiful  work!
1065125,Spiel,2020-08-20 12:33:00,9065,"I remember him well John, I even had opportunity to train his daughter Sarah some years later in the Plate Mill cranes. Very nice young lady.  	I'm experimenting with a new coating on the reel seat, it's used on Mag Rims so I suspect (hope) that it is very durable. Thank you and yes, cross slide with a vertical riser."
