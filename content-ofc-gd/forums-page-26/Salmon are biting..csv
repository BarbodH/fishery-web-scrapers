1065105,Fisherman,2020-08-19 17:55:00,7201,"In the boat, was a super calm day, just a ripple on the water.  I  really have to cherry pick the days or the back punishes me."
1065108,misfish,2020-08-19 19:54:00,29133,"I was a bit to early to get a jar, as he was just prepping for the canning.  I think I will drop off a catch and share, if he is willing to can for me."

1065142,Old Ironmaker,2020-08-21 01:39:00,8243,"Nice fish fr sure. I wonder if they are hitting out in the lake. Lake Ontario. Big Dave Drifter,  there were some powerful drugs in the late 60's and early 70's when I was in High School and I see they are still available. I did not try any and I didn't smoke anything until grade 13 and I didn't inhale. And yes I walked 8 miles 1 way in 3 feet of snow to get to school. The bus was 10 cents but that dime bought me a burger or fries in the cafeteria at lunch. I always could sell my salami or prosciutto with roasted red pepper or eggplant for 2 burgers and fries. I hated those sangwidges my mangi buddies loved them."
