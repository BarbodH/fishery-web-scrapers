1064990,irishfield,2020-08-16 21:26:00,26272,"Why I told Glen to bring it to me... as I have a few rivets. Although returning things to where they once were, before the Daughter's wedding in the hangar last Fall, didn't go quite as smooth as I'd hoped... but I have the right stuff somewhere.. LOL   "
1064991,John,2020-08-16 21:52:00,2956,This is the way to go Glen....
1064993,wkrp,2020-08-16 22:12:00,656,I hope Transport Canada doesn't see that
1064994,irishfield,2020-08-16 22:50:00,26272,"How do you know at least 2 TC inspectors haven't already??.. and they had a damn good laugh like everyone else that's seen the ""pick up"". They don't care as to what I assemble/repair their amateur builts with! I don't work on certified airplanes and this isn't the only stock of rivets I have, just the stuff that had the marine heads in it.... somewhere under there. I tipped the shelves, did some swearing and walked away 2 months ago!"

1065019,cisco,2020-08-17 20:31:00,597,"Wayne you're a good man to offer up the help. With summer student work available I suggest hiring a youngster to well.... ""See that bunch of stuff that fell off the shelf and got kinda mixed up? Put it all back on the shelf sorted proper."" For you a tax write off/business expense. For a kid some needed dough. AND you can turn your back on it like it never happened rather than cussing each time you think of it or walk past. What I'd do anyways."
1065026,irishfield,2020-08-17 21:18:00,26272,"I had a single employee in the ""skunk works"" years ago and quickly remembered why I walked out of our 100+ employee plastics plant. I'm done.. not going back in time. I have no income, nothing to write off against and enough ""losses for future years"" available on both businesses that I'll never see them used in my life time even if I suddenly got a contract from JT!  . I have two airplanes left to refurbish, then sell and then it's auction time here. I've said it for years and need to take my own advise, life's too damn short! Especially considering Jennifer has now been gone for 5 years. Glen and I have spent a lot of time on the water together, his best claim to fame is a 14'r with Terry as a witness, then a snagged fishing rod and yes there was a Muskie in the mix. He knows fully that it is an open offer and there was no $ figure stated as it wasn't going to cost him anything."
1065029,Hack_Fisherman,2020-08-17 21:44:00,720,I see these tiny rivets as a trades equivalent but well played! could be worse I suppose. Like iPhone screws
1065030,irishfield,2020-08-17 21:46:00,26272,There's a box or two of AN470-AD1-4's or 5's in there... they'll get vacuumed up! LOL
1065031,misfish,2020-08-17 22:32:00,29133,"Hey Glen  When yer ready to rip and throw,I have a great sawzal. If it breaks through the haul, not to worry. Wayne can fix that too."
1065033,wkrp,2020-08-17 23:01:00,656,Ok guys  I have to chime in  but I  think  that Flex Seal might be the solution. I can bring the screen door. Lol
1064929,glen,2020-08-15 20:46:00,2641,About 40 rivits and the keel has a crack. I guess about a couple gph. I’m still ok to use it because I have a 750gph pump.  But I’m going to stay within 10miles of shore.  For sale one gentle used boat pick up on the bottom of the lake.    	With that many rivits loose I’m worried the boat might brake in half on a wave.    the hull has a lot of paint on it.   	so fill the keel crack with JB weld and paint the rivits again I guess.   	Any thoughts?
1064930,wkrp,2020-08-15 20:53:00,656,Tighten up the rivets if you have access on both sides and 3m 5200 on the crack
1064933,Cast-Away,2020-08-15 21:59:00,790,"Hey Glen, if you want to have it professionally repaired let me know. I can recommend a place near London that fixed mine last year. Not cheap but it was done right."
1064941,irishfield,2020-08-15 23:56:00,26272,"I know a guy, but he's on holidays!"
1064945,Old Ironmaker,2020-08-16 00:38:00,8243,"I know a guy but he's retired. I can say with certainty if you can see 40 loose rivets there are another 40 you can't see. I don't know how old the boat is but like everything else boats have a best before date that after that date we start to throw good money at. It's odd to me that we are more than willing to lose money trading in or scraping cars and trucks  and buying something newer or new but insist that 40 year old boats and motors run like they are new.  I agree boats are toys and vehicles get us to work and back so we can buy more toys. edit: What's the 10 mile thing? You can swim 10 miles, man you should be in the  Fisherman Olympics. They are cancelled this year."
1064947,glen,2020-08-16 01:00:00,2641,I know there are different options. That’s why I’m really thinking.  I bought a brand new motor and had a custom trailer made to my spec.  I redid this boat about 15 years ago.  Trailering has been hard on the boat.   	If I pull the floor out now I can’t fish anymore this year.  But I want to redo the floor and change the layout a bit.  I have more faith in new rivits then tightening the old ones.  40 seems like a bit of work though.    	I doubt a new boat would take the pounding. Don’t you fell safer when you can still see shore.  (10 miles).
1064952,AKRISONER,2020-08-16 04:21:00,5558,Do you mind sharing the make and year of your boat?
1064953,glen,2020-08-16 11:49:00,2641,"1975 Starcraft kingfisher.   	Poorly treated. Rammed rocks.   I’ve trailered it about 60,000km over the years. mid season brake down blues."

1064962,Whitespinnerbait,2020-08-16 13:25:00,2038,Time for the Boat Graveyard...😉
1064965,glen,2020-08-16 13:30:00,2641,What are the paying for scrap painted aluminum?
1064969,Hack_Fisherman,2020-08-16 14:16:00,720,"I’d pay scrap value for it!! OP; it’s tough to find any boats this year, I bought and sold one in a week, had several more disappear before I could inquire. (Within days of listing) I say patch it up with 5200 and use gently for the rest of the season. Repair this winter. if rivets are really bad, what about using closed end pop rivets wicked in a bit of 5200 as a temp repair?"
1064971,glen,2020-08-16 14:46:00,2641,"I see now that   Somewhere on the keel, water is leaking and coming out the keel rib drain hole. ( The boat has three ribs with drain holes.)As if 40 leaking rivets ain’t bad enough.   	10gph leaks total I guess.    	Come  on give me a break I want to go fishing."
1064972,Hack_Fisherman,2020-08-16 15:20:00,720,I wonder if the keel plug (sealant in the keel trough where the hull begins to fold together to form the bow) is leaking. I had a tin boat where the caulking had shrunk and it was a pretty fast leak.
1064973,Cast-Away,2020-08-16 15:21:00,790,Heritage Marine in London. They replaced 11 rivets and replaced the floor and carpeting. They did a great job.
1064974,pics,2020-08-16 15:47:00,1268,Its going to cost more that the boat is worth unless you strip it right down yourself.. then theres the rebuild..
1064977,glen,2020-08-16 16:08:00,2641,How do you measure the cost of lost fishing time.
1064978,Cast-Away,2020-08-16 16:13:00,790,"My rebuild was $4,800 Glen on a 19 year old boat."
1064979,irishfield,2020-08-16 16:15:00,26272,"Fish out the season Glen, then rip the floor out and bring it up to me...."
1064980,wkrp,2020-08-16 16:18:00,656,40 leaky rivets is no big deal 3 hour job once you have access. I would be concerned about the hull leak which if a crack is the culprit then a aluminum doubler repair would be required.
1064984,misfish,2020-08-16 16:39:00,29133,Be sure to deliver after 10 am Glen . Seems to be a rule about showing up early .. LOL  Nice offer Wayne.
1064985,AKRISONER,2020-08-16 17:45:00,5558,Not sure I’d sink a ton into a 1975 if you’ve got the outboard. lots of aluminum hulls to be found with no motor. especially any guys running those early 2000’s two strokes. They all blew and left the owners with no motor.
1064987,Fisherman,2020-08-16 19:34:00,7201,"On the humourous side, you could get a few cans of that flex seal and spray it shut,  buddy on the commercial does it with a screen door bottomed boat.   No screen doors were hurt during the commercial. I'd be actively looking for another hull, fall is fast approaching and some don't want to store their stuff, good deals to be had. "
1064988,floater,2020-08-16 20:12:00,220,I have an open floor plan 14 foot deep and wide. It too was leaking from so many rivets it would sink in four days if I left it in the water. I removed the interior floors and everything and found most of the water was coming in from the bottom of the transom. I ended up replacing 150 rivets. I used the airplane rivets and a bucking block and it was actually very easy to do. Just very noisy. It took me about two weeks to do the whole job because it took awhile to find a place that sold the rivets. I say fix it.
