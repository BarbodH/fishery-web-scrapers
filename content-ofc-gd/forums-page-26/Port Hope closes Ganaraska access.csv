1065412,BillM,2020-09-02 16:49:00,17367,Going to be good returns in the next 3-4 years.  Sucks for some but nothing but positives from a fishery standpoint.   Instagram and Facebook might be a bit upset with the lack of hero shots.
1065413,grimsbylander,2020-09-02 18:14:00,3016,"Great for the fishery yes, but sales at the Peter Street beer store are going to take a beating. 😁"
1065417,misfish,2020-09-02 22:48:00,29133,Atlantic numbers are going to flourish.
1065418,Rustic-Fisher,2020-09-03 00:28:00,826,"My Opinion ... This is great news ! we're 10 min N of the town , so were kind of local.  Every year since we've lived here (4yrs) i 've taken my now 10 year old down to fish for Salmon .  THIS year  it was insane !!! crazier than other years . Great chance to teach a new angler about ethics ........... "
