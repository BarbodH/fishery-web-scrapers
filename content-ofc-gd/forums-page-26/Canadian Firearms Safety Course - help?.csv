1065275,Canuck,2020-08-28 18:45:00,491,"Guys, I neglected to renew my Firearms License a few years back and unfortunately my firearms safety course 45 or so years ago is no longer recognized, so the RCMP have told me I need to take the CFAC before my licence will be approved.  A bit of a pain, but I understand the reasoning - I guess. Problem is that the CFAC courses were all shut down for COVID and there is an enormous backlog and its been hard to find a course with an opening anywhere near home (Oakville ) or our cottage (Penetang).  If any of you know anyone that is accredited to teach the CFAC, can you help me out?  The RCMP told me that they can extend the deadline for my application expiring given the COVID issues, but I want to get this done ASAP. Thanks"

1065289,Canuck,2020-08-29 17:15:00,491,"I agree. Don't let your Possession and Acquisition licence go un-renewed.  If you do, you have to start over with a full RCMP application, and take the CFAC course again."
