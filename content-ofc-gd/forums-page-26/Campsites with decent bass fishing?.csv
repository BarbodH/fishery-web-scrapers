Is it possible that an admin could delete the original post?** Hi All, Me and a few buddies want to get away for a weekend fishing. Can anyone suggest a few options for campsites (tenting) that offer ok bass fishing on a lake, within about 2 hours or so of Toronto? We have a 14 foot boat with motor and will need to launch it. Thanks for any help!"

1064863,Rizzo,2020-08-14 12:17:00,4754,I used to catch a lot of Bass at 6 mile lake PP....30 years ago when I went there regularly
1064865,David Chong,2020-08-14 13:02:00,836,I would second that suggestion! Bass Lake Provincial Park is a nice little park and the bass fishing is pretty good!
1064866,David Chong,2020-08-14 13:03:00,836,"Another great choice, Balsam Lake Provincial Park is also a good option! Lots of choices!"
1064872,AKRISONER,2020-08-14 13:33:00,5558,Emily. Pigeon has really good largemouth down in the south end. Dece smallies up north too. A bit further but Sturgeon Bay has really good smallmouth fishing.
1064874,David Chong,2020-08-14 13:36:00,836,So many choices!Â ðŸ˜„
1064875,AKRISONER,2020-08-14 13:52:00,5558,Ontario without a doubt has the best bass fishing anywhere in the world. Personally I would pick lakes where I can avoid crowds or if Im only running a 14 foot tinner where I can avoid getting swamped. Aside from that you can basically pick your poison.
1064876,beenfishing,2020-08-14 14:32:00,21,Thanks everyone. Good advice! I'm going to look up the places you suggested.
1064914,pics,2020-08-15 12:12:00,1268,For Bass I would second Emily PP..
1064921,Terry,2020-08-15 16:48:00,14456,"I agree, you can start fishing right at the ramp"

1065039,beenfishing,2020-08-18 00:43:00,21,Thanks Icon!
1065040,beenfishing,2020-08-18 00:43:00,21,Thanks Terry!
1065041,beenfishing,2020-08-18 00:44:00,21,Good option - thanks Drifter!
1065043,DRIFTER_016,2020-08-18 01:34:00,10439,Used to go there all the time back in the day. Would load up my 12 foot tinny with 5 1/2 hp Johnson and make the trip. 
1065203,jimmer,2020-08-24 16:54:00,2730,"I know many have mentioned Emily Park, but the lake is getting a super amount of pressure this year and the fishing is suffering from my experience. Pick a nice small lake in Haliburton County around West Guilford, you will enjoy the lower amount of boat traffic and no deer flies."
1065225,mamona,2020-08-25 14:04:00,597,Second to that.
