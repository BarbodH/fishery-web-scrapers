1065644,Hank Jr,2020-09-10 15:49:00,146,Hi Everyone My son and I can't make our fall trip to Canada because of the border being closed . So we are going to try a lake in NY for Muskies in Oct . Have any of you guys fished this lake ? I know its a long shot just trying to get as much info as I can for our trip . Thanks for your help .  Hank Jr
1065650,grimsbylander,2020-09-10 17:52:00,3016,I’ve fished a few bass tournaments on Chautaugua but never musky. That lake has a very healthy population of bass considering how hard it gets hit. Let us know how you make out.
1065654,OhioFisherman,2020-09-10 19:00:00,6623,"I have fished it before, but not for 17 years or so, it did seem to have a healthy muskie population back then and some one in our bass club usually hooked on in every tournament trip there. North end of the lake is deeper overall than the south end, using the I-86 bridge as the center point, but ski's seem to be on both ends and the middle."

1065676,Rizzo,2020-09-11 12:55:00,4754,Never fished it but have often heard of it! Exciting to try new waters. Would be great to hear a report later on how it worked out
1065679,AKRISONER,2020-09-11 13:49:00,5558,"that release was cringeworthy, why the heck didnt the guy tail it longer? He then comments ""im surprised it survived""  anyways not to thread hijack...sorry ahaha I would take note of what you see in that video, those guys are targeting an area near a major overpass, time to hop on google maps and use streetview to figure out the area they are fishing.

1065685,Hank Jr,2020-09-11 16:15:00,146,Thanks for the help . A couple guys from NY who I helped with their Kawartha's trip sent me some good info and a map with areas to try . I hope we will be able to boat a few
