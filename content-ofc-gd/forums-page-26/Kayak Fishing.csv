Thanks."
1065374,Dutch01,2020-09-01 19:27:00,1431,"If you're on Facebook checkout Kawartha Kayak Fishing Club (Kawartha area), Hard Knox Kayak Fishing (Niagara/Southwestern Ontario) and KAAO - Kayak Anglers Association of the Outaouais (Eastern Ontario).  Loads of great guys and gals to exhange tips and ideas, and all three groups have regular kayak fishing get togethers. Silent Lake Provincial Park is no motors allowed, there's loads but that's one just off the top of my head."

1065378,gordy28,2020-09-01 20:56:00,638,Not sure where you live but around the GTA a lot of the conservation area's are perfect for kayak fishing A few I have tried: Island Lake in Orangeville Kelso in Milton Guelph Lake in Guelph Rockwood Conservation area in Rockwood  Also check out the Backroad Map Books - there is one called Ontario Cottage Country I believe and its great for finding smaller out of the way lakes to check out  Cheers Andrew
