714932,Stoty,2012-07-16 15:07:00,2910,I was thinking about doing a weekend trip to Weslemkoon Lake later this summer and was wondering if there are any campgrounds (for tents) on the lake at all?  Any help is much appreciated!
714935,4x4bassin,2012-07-16 15:34:00,1025,"If I remember there was a guy on this board back in the spring talking about his resort/campground on that lake but the thread was shot down (spam) Sorry , can't remember the name of it ! From what I have been told , Weslemkoon is a great bass lake , good luck"
714973,SirCranksalot,2012-07-16 16:40:00,3291,"If there are none on W'koon, then there's some on Otter, which is really part of the same lake(access thru narrow channel)."
714974,Stoty,2012-07-16 16:41:00,2910,Do you have the names or links to any of those on Otter?
714981,hirk,2012-07-16 16:57:00,571,There is a resort at the very south end with a launch and tent camping near the channel to ephrinham lake. You drive through Gilmore and the road takes you right to the resort.
715004,cityfisher,2012-07-16 18:43:00,959,"lots of crown land in the area, if you dont mind REAL camping. Ive always stay at the lodge on the south though..."
715026,skidoosafari,2012-07-16 19:49:00,46,"Pretty sure that lakes all fished out, come to think of it I think it dried up with all this hot weather we have been getting. Lol Hidden cove cottage resort. 2040 Hartsmere Road RR1 McArthurs Mills, Ontario (613) 474-3284 This one's at the north end of the lake.  I will be in that neck of the woods this weekend."
715028,Stoty,2012-07-16 19:53:00,2910, I'd be totally down for crown land camping....problem is can't charge batteries.
715031,SirCranksalot,2012-07-16 20:03:00,3291,"  Stoty,  that's what I meant when I mentioned Otter.  "
715060,Stoty,2012-07-16 21:03:00,2910," Do they have tent sites available, do you know?"
715061,Roy,2012-07-16 21:06:00,13728, Get a few friends to lend you a coupla power packs.
715327,cityfisher,2012-07-17 14:48:00,959, +1  I have the big 800w powerpack(crappy tire) and have used it to charge my trolling motors overnight while camping.
715500,misfish,2012-07-17 21:11:00,29133,"Weslemkoon Lake  When I seen your post about Weslemkoon Lake Jamie,I wanted to post right away,but sat back and reflected on my past. I had one of my best weeks vacation on that lake, with my family and my grandfather and his brother(my uncle).When I was 22 yoa. It,s a great lake.Many places to fish for bass. Pads and weeds and rock edges. My grandfathers rule was,early morning,and hit the lake after dinner.Man,he knew this lake. If Im not mistaken,my go to lure back then was the,frog pattern beno. Wonder what a sinko would of done back then? LOL   Have a great time if you head there. It is a great bass lake.  Sorry cant help with a camp ground. Like I said,I was 22."
715574,Stoty,2012-07-18 00:56:00,2910,I located a campground this morning and have booked the trip! Can't wait! Thanks again for all input!
724522,206,2012-08-23 12:46:00,563, If you have gone how did you make out?  Anyone know if there is a public launch on Weslemkoon?
724699,Stoty,2012-08-24 02:38:00,2910,"Ya, I went a couple weekends ago.... Caught a ton of fish, but only a few ""bigger"" ones. lots in the 1-2lb range.  Apparently this year has been really tough fishing according to the locals. They've had a season-long derby and the fish that was leading it is 4.2lbs.  I caught a 4.56lb'er.... but the derby was only open to residents of the resort we stayed on. Darn!   Not sure about the boat launch question, as I used the one that the resort had."

1065359,dave524,2020-09-01 13:19:00,4508,"I was there 20 years ago, as I recall the majourity of cottages were water access, including the friend's I was at. The access road on the south end dead ended at a marina with a large parking lot, maybe it has changed but I wouldn't get my hopes up."
