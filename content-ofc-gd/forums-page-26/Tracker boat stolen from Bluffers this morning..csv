1064831,John Bacon,2020-08-13 15:46:00,3277,Someone had their Tracker boat stolen from the Bluffers parking lot this morning. Â I am not sure of the specific model; but it was a pretty large boat. They parked at the public launch and left to help a friend pull a boat from the marina and their boat & trailer had been removed from their truck. Â I saw the boat around 7:00 am this morning. Â It was gone by 8:45 am. Â If anyone else saw the boat parked in the public launch between those times it may help narrow the time down a bit. 
1064835,Terry,2020-08-13 16:19:00,14456,Wow some people have balls.
1064836,John Bacon,2020-08-13 16:39:00,3277,STOLEN BOAT  PLEASE CALL 9-1-1 TO REPORT SIGHTINGS  STOLEN FROM BLUFFERS PARK MARINA ON TRAILER ON THURSDAY AUGUST 13 BETWEEN 730-845am (black trailer with grey cover) Trailer plate S46 69E
1064837,Fisherman,2020-08-13 18:21:00,7201,Well hopefully there's insurance.Â  But why steal a cracker. Feel sad for the owner.
1064847,Whitespinnerbait,2020-08-13 22:53:00,2038,Insurance job ???
1064851,AKRISONER,2020-08-14 00:32:00,5558,guy is pretty well known on social media and connected to this site through 1 degree of separation.Â   	dudes also a hardcore fisherman so I donâ€™t see why heâ€™d get rid of the boat when heâ€™d just need another one. Toronto and the GTA just keeps getting worse by the year for this crap as the city gets bigger and bigger 
1064852,Whitespinnerbait,2020-08-14 00:49:00,2038,"Well, sounds like some pretty brave individuals to pull something like that offÂ ðŸ¤¤"
1064854,npt1,2020-08-14 00:59:00,220,"YES, It's put an entire new meaning to the phrase--------- what is your hitch ""BALL SIZE""."
1064855,John Bacon,2020-08-14 01:01:00,3277,I highly doubt that. 
1064896,Hack_Fisherman,2020-08-14 22:07:00,720,"That sucks, 600v antitheft systems should be legal. I hope it gets recovered"
1064899,Terry,2020-08-14 22:37:00,14456,It hasÂ been recovered 
1064910,John Bacon,2020-08-15 02:08:00,3277,Good news.Â  Did they catch the guy(s) that took it?
1064911,Fisherman,2020-08-15 02:30:00,7201,"Apparently the boat is a disaster, more or less trash and everything worth anything removed."
1064913,DRIFTER_016,2020-08-15 04:44:00,10439,They didn't get the big motor off though.
