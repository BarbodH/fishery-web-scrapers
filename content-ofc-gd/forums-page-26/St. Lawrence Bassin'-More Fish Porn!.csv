We fished anywhere from 15-50 FOW and caught some beautiful Smallies, there were also lots of smaller specimens. By no means was the fishing easy but always fun to try something new and catch a few hawgs! The majority of the fish came on a dropshot rig, a Ned rig or a Carolina rig! A Z-Man TrickShotZ for dropshotting, Finesse TRD for Ned rigging and a Diesel MinnowÂ for Carolina rigging were the ticket, still blown away by how long these baits last on the hook!        "

1064938,David Chong,2020-08-15 23:05:00,836,Tried some different areas based how it looks on the Relief Shading! Gives you a different perspective on what the bottom looks like as opposed to just depth lines.
