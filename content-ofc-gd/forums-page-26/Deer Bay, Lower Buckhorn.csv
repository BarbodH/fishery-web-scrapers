1065472,David Chong,2020-09-04 00:34:00,836,I haven't fished Deer Bay in Lower Buckhorn for years but the weeds were not too bad! There is quite a bit near shore but once you got out to 10-12 FOW there usually was a nice edge!
1065489,mamona,2020-09-04 14:41:00,597,"Yeah, weeds are not bad over there. You will be fine. Different story if you go on the other side of the channel. "
