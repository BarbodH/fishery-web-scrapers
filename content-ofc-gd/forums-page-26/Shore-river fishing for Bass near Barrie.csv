I'm kind of at a loss for where to find them this late in the year. Normally I'd start at the Nottawasaga river, but the Essa township requires an access pass that they are no longer selling due to COVID. I know lake simcoe has some excellent bass but its hard to get to a lot of the beds without a boat, and this late in the year in Simcoe I imagine they're holding on the rock ledges around the bays and probably up at big bay point. I was thinking maybe the Holland might have some bass, if anyone has any good spots I'm all ears. Thanks in advance, Mitch "
