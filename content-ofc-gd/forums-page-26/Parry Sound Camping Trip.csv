1065015,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-17 19:39:00,602,"Just got back from a 4 night family camping/fishing trip in Parry Sound. Save to say we did very well! My son caught quite a few bass He had a huge one break off a couple days ago, that was cruising around under a dock, so we came back this morning before heading back home and he caught it this time. The Monster was 20 inches long, 6 inches thick, 6.4 pounds! we are going to be a replica made, it swam away just fine. Awesome fish!         "
1065017,misfish,2020-08-17 20:01:00,29133,Great job kiddo.
1065027,irishfield,2020-08-17 21:26:00,26272,"NICE.. NICE.. NICE... a fishing report ! What a lucky lad that child of yours, enjoying the outdoors and fish to boot!"
1065028,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-17 21:39:00,602,"He definitely has the fishing bug now, he loves it! I'm more of a guide now which I really don't mind, awesome seeing him get excited and catch some big ones. We drove around up in the Parry Sound area just looking for spots and boat launches to fish from, it was a good time exploring, love that area up there. Never ending supply of little lakes that hold monsters. "
1065036,Rizzo,2020-08-18 00:03:00,4754,Slob of a bass! Congrats. We used to have a place near Parry Sound and I had a few fish like that living around the dock. I would feed them worms by the dozen...then every once in a while put a hook in a worm and tell a visiting kid to dangle it off the dock. Many a happy kid caught a pb off that dock! and a 5 or 6 lb bass on a scoobie doo rod is great fun to watch
1065037,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-18 00:06:00,602,Awesome! Sometimes I wonder why we spent X amount on everything and then itâ€™s a little kid with a worm and a Disney rod that catches the huge ones lol!
1065038,wkrp,2020-08-18 00:12:00,656,Thats FishingÂ  and what an awesome outcome . Never to be forgotten. Hi 5Â from me
1065051,gordy28,2020-08-18 11:37:00,638,That looks like an awesome trip and a fisherman for life! Â  Congrats thatâ€™s a beauty fish Andrew
1065052,AKRISONER,2020-08-18 11:59:00,5558,that fish is an absolute cow. Unreal.  IMO you just ruined fishing for your kid for life. 6.4 is going to take a long long time for him to beat ahahaÂ ðŸ˜„ Unreal man. Plenty of anglers will fish their entire lives in Ontario and never run into a bass that big. I still havent! and I live in the area!
1065053,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-18 12:01:00,602,"Ya I know, Iâ€™ve spoiled him, everything is small now lol!"
1065055,AKRISONER,2020-08-18 12:03:00,5558,those 3lb smallies just arent going to cut it anymore lol
1065056,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-18 12:09:00,602,"Sorry guys, canâ€™t stop sharing these "
1065057,Fisherman,2020-08-18 12:47:00,7201,"You are doing a pretty good job of starting a new angler,Â  looks like he's pretty happy."
1065060,mamona,2020-08-18 14:10:00,597,Nothing better than successful fishing trip for a kid. He will remember that for sure
1065093,Freshtrax,2020-08-19 04:36:00,2215,Awesome.Â  His face says it all.Â  Â  Â Good job dad.
1065101,LeXXington,2020-08-19 15:53:00,1928,Love the pictures!
1065106,Cando,2020-08-19 18:01:00,90,Very nice. Glad he was able to go back and catch it
1065133,fundseeker,2020-08-20 15:10:00,27,"I'm Glad you enjoyed your camping /Fishing trip in ""The Hoot"" . ( ""refers to frequent train whistles in and around the town"") I've been fortunate to live here for 35 years. ""Ya'll Come Back Now"""
1065141,LefroyFisherman,2020-08-20 21:13:00,602,"We were staying at the Parry Sound KOA. Ya, I wasn't too amused with the Trains blowing their horns every 5 mins during the night, brutal. We got earplugs the next bunch of nights. I'm looking to get a trailer up there and I'll be sure too make note of the track locations lol!"
