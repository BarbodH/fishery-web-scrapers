I've got all the methods for gitting to them, stell, rigger etc, but other than watching the finder, want to know more about how to isolate the depths. Thanksm, Thrasher"

Provided of course, that you are allowed more than one rod per angler. If not, then multiple passes at different depth where you see them on the finder. Hope that helps."
