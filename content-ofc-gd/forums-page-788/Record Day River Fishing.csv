383190,laszlo,2009-09-15 01:26:00,487,"Total Hours Fishing: 6  Total Fish Landed: 19     ***NEW RECORD FOR A HALF DAY OF FISHING***  13 Smallies - Largest 14""  5 Walleye - Largest 16""  1 Largemouth - 14""  What a day. The bite stayed on the entire time I was fishing. Tube Jigs all the way. Just changed up the size and colour when the bite slowed down.  Don't have days like this too often. Usually average one fish per hour. The larger fish did elude me though.   All the walleye were about this size consistantly.     All the smallies were around the same size as well.      Now it's time to wait for the Rainbows.  Oh...what's with all the styrofoam containers??? I must have seen at least 30 of them all over the place."
