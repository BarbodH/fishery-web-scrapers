382735,fishinguypat,2009-09-13 20:09:00,547,how are the salmon conditions coming?i've heard there almost all stacked up around the piers now and the next rain will hit them up the river...what are the best baits to use when they enter the river cause i am considering bronte creek next week...
382737,CLofchik,2009-09-13 20:13:00,854,"Consider another river. Worst season at Bronte in 20 years.  I thought last year was bad, I didn't know bad until this season."
382738,hendrix,2009-09-13 20:15:00,61,"throw shiny things off the piers, seems to work pretty well"
382739,Ziki,2009-09-13 20:17:00,128, ya no kidding. What is going on with Bronte? all other rivers have got at least SOME fish.
382779,tdotfisherman,2009-09-13 23:02:00,317,"I've had a better year so far off the West End tribs/piers/mouths than I did last year.. my first 20 hours of fishing last fall I didn't catch one fish, this year my first 20 hours have yielded 3 salmon on, and 1 Chinook landed. 20 hours is a fair amount, but we're not exactly targeting small Rock Bass here are we?"
382824,ironstone74,2009-09-14 01:30:00,201," Yeah it's brutal.  I'm selling my gear... 13' Frontier 20 bucks, Islander 20 bucks.  Worst it's been in 24.5 years."
382830,mooseroo,2009-09-14 01:45:00,80,"We were out on the West pier at Port Hope on Friday night and the Salmon were hitting pretty regularly. There were a good 20-30 people along the pier. ""FISH ON... COMING UP""  We were chucking spoons and while we didn't have any luck, there were a lot of landed fish.  Good luck out there!"
