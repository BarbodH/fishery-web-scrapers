382688,River Rat,2009-09-13 15:39:00,161,"These sites are good for general information to point a guy in the right direction. IMO, time on the water is the best way to ""gather inormation"", not the internet......a guy that spends 500 hours a year on Simcoe (for example) deserves to reap the benifit of the time and expense of putting that kind of TIME ON THE WATER. Many of the people that visit these sites have no idea what kind of commitment it takes to learn how to consistantly hook fish under changing conditions. A point in the right direction is nice, most tackle shops will do that for you too....turn off the computer, get outside, meet people...fill gas tanks and fight with your wives to get away fishing....the payoff is so much better when you suffer a bit to get it!!!  RR"
382693,Radnine,2009-09-13 15:54:00,1538," I agree with your post, as it pertains to fishing. But this site is about way more than where the fish are biting or how to catch them. In fact, I think that it is in this regard that critics of the board misunderstand it the most. Jim"

382221,brw,2009-09-11 18:22:00,101,"My take on this board is entirely different. It is one of the most civil boards I have seen. By and large, if people disagree, there is a minimal amount of name calling and personal attacks. In fact, I made an observation the other day to my son: as an American, I have been increasingly appalled at the complete lack of decorum and the instant launching of crude and shameless personal attacks on a number of ""american"" Internet sites like CNN, or even ESPN.  By comparison, this Board is refreshingly civil compared to those sites. In my years travelling to Canada (over 30 years now and counting), I have come to the belief, rightly or wrongly, that by and large, my experience with Canadians is that they are much more tempered, civil, and laid back than the folks in my country. There are always exceptions to the rule, of course. But we are becoming more polarized every day here, shouting louder at each other at every turn, and it's disappointing. I'm no expert, but I don't get that same feeling here or at other Canadian sites I visit.  I also think that as avid fishermen, we are generally a more affable lot and that contributes too to the largely good vibes on this Board.  So hat's off to OFC and its members. It's one of my favorite sites around."

382227,aplumma,2009-09-11 19:09:00,6896,I have found that every comment ever made has the potential to be misunderstood by a few. I admit that we all take the liberties to say something to someone on the board that between the two of us is understood but read by the others on the internet it looks different. I can say that I have called Roy a dwarf... T.J. a fuzzy bear and Glen a redneck or worse. All three of them know that Roy is the tallest man I know not in height but in life. T.J. if his heart got any bigger he would explode and Glen has the education and the back round to qualify as a scholar on more subjects than I can count.  I have also found that as time goes on and you take the time to be here you will learn who in the back round knows what kind of information they specialize in. To take advise from people you don't know is down right dangerous. I would no sooner trust any information I give you no matter how good it sounds on painting but if you asked Roy or Pam you would find info you can bank on. With a knowledge base this broad full of specialist you will find that a P.M. to the right person is the correct way to get the answers on any subject. The key though is to put your time in on the board posting pictures or information so that people feel like expending the energy to answer your questions. I can honestly say that their are over a hundred people who with a phone call would jump at the chance to help me when the day comes that I need it because of the past seeds that I have sowed here on OFC.

382517,Big Cliff,2009-09-12 21:08:00,6899,"I've been hanging around this board for a while now, I've sort of lost count but it has to be close to 10 years. When the board changed a few years back I opted to not keep my old post count; history never really did interest me much. I have looked at a few other sites, even registered on a few but never found a place that I was as comfortable as right here!  Over the years I have made so many wonderful friends that I couldn't possably count them all, as time has gone by, some have moved on for one reason or another but many have stayed part of my life. Some I have never even met, some I have enjoyed many wonderful fishing trips with. Some I only get to see once or twice a year but I cherish each and every one of them just the same.  I have had the pleasure of being able to be a part of the ""Fishing for Tyler"" event (which is such a pleasure and an honor), go on some of the most wonderful charters in my life, get advise and help on almost any topic often within minutes of asking, and when I asked for help to put my docks in last year, 16 people showed up in cold windy weather, and before you could say ""thank you"" the docks were in. You tell me, do you know any other websites where that would happen?  This board may not be to everyones liking, no matter how hard you try, you just can't please everyone! If you feel this isn't the place for you then you should explore other options. I am always sad to see someone go (well almost)   but if you do take the time to hang around you will quickly find that this isn't just a message board, it is a family.  So, go if you must; stay if you will. Keep it civil and the door will always be open."

381752,Roy,2009-09-10 12:33:00,13728,"Well said, Bill."
381768,MJL,2009-09-10 13:17:00,2427," The way I see things.  It was free to sign up and it costs nothing to leave – Why complain?  Everything about the use of this message board is done voluntarily by its members.  You can give a lot of tips out to others and you can get a lot back (In most cases like others have said, you get what you give)…You however are not guaranteed or entitled to getting answers for questions or replies to your posts.  Be prepared to receive replies you weren’t expecting (if any).  OFC is what it is…The information contained within these pages is free for members, lurkers and Google-bots alike to view and make use of the information.  I personally don’t reply very often to requests asking where I’ve been fishing (especially to those who have a post count of zero) – I’m not an ass (Really I’m not) – I just don’t appreciate seeing spent fishing line and empty beer bottles dumped in my favourite fishing spots by those who might have less of an appreciation of the environment than I do.  I’m sure you would agree with that as well…If I remember correctly, you yourself ripped the piss out of a 17 yr old kid earlier this spring for posting the name of a certain steelhead creek who was only trying to help somebody out. Would I feel the same if my home spot was posted on the net?  Probably…I certainly would’ve handled it differently though.  If you absolutely need an answer for fixing a motorcycle, car or lawn tractor, like GCD mentioned, a reputable mechanic is the way to go…You’ll pay some $, but you’ll get an answer for it.  Failing that, try an automobile based message board.  Failing all of that, OFC – but be prepared to receive replies or answers you might not be looking for or ones that won’t be as helpful as if you went to the mechanic yourself.  If OFC doesn’t provide you the answers for your fishing questions, there are other resources available to you:  Stop in at the nearest tackle shop and chat with the owner, take a walk or scout out the lake/river/stream you want to fish and talk to the anglers there (I see very few people doing this).  You can also hire a fishing guide for the day, pick up a few books from the bookstore or library (definite goldmine here), use the “Ask Italo” feature on the Canadian Sport-fishing web-site or ask a pro on WFN (a couple of which already use OFC), etc.  As great as OFC is – I really hate to say this – It isn’t the “be-all” of fishing information.  Be pro-active and resourceful in your quest for information.  I still can’t understand why so many people get worked up about message boards…People were fishing long before the internet came into conception right?  At least I was…  OFC is great, I’ve met so many people who share the same passion of fishing that I have and can communicate with those who are literally thousands of km away.  I’ve posted fishing reports in the past and received free advice on where to try next without even asking for it from members I’ve never met or spoken to previously.  Lurkers who have never posted a single thing on OFC have recognized me out on the water and given me tips and free bait when they see me.  The members of this board, given an introduction with some participation now and then, are some of the friendliest and most helpful people you can find. Several of the members have guided me around their home waters FOR FREE (a $375 value each trip).  Saying please and thank you really does go a long way.  I came for some fishing tips but stayed because of the people."

The OFC is an all encompassing board, you can ask just about anything here and someone will answer your question. This is the place to be, hang your hat, go to the G2G's and the swills ( Steve!! ) once you become family there is no getting away from it.

We know how it works. There are about 5,000 members here and a lot of them are close friends. What bothers me about all of this is that a few mentally challenged folks are able to pit friends against each other.  The mentally challenged that I refer to are online as we speak and are  revelling in their success. That REALLY bothers me. This is the most active fishing site in North America so you just HAVE to understand that the dinks who want recognition will hit this one first. I'm quite sick of all of this and will deal with it severely as it happens now. I hope that the 'dudes' who want to leave just leave. We really don't have time for this crap.

I tell all guys and try to answer most posts usually but have no problem sharing and even offering open seats most of the time.  I have found there have been a few idiots lately on the board but overall I find this one to be the best. There has been a few guys name calling but that just shows there character and sometimes it takes very little time to reveal.  GCD is kinda like the comic releif of the site and to read his posts makes my day sometimes. Funny and angry and sarcastic all at once. He is like our own Howard Stern,LOL.  Overall the site sems to be the best. I dont get any I have won a million dollars and I need to send $5000 to Nigeria type of emails. Site is clean and the mods do a hell of a job. You will get alot of people who need to vent sometimes but everyone has a bad day now and then. I'm on every board out there and I seem to frequent this the most.  Keep up the good work guys"

381324,anders,2009-09-09 18:23:00,1168,  You post all the time??   You joined in '07 and you dont even have 200 posts...well less than 1 a day....but thanks for always posting!  Cmon man....lighten up...go have a beer!

381337,ecmilley,2009-09-09 18:37:00,2163,looks like we can start the console tiller debate 8 months early why we are at it
381346,BITEME,2009-09-09 18:51:00,1968, SO what your saying is your like a hemorrhoid kinda hanging around outta sight and every so often pop out to cause discomfort. Preperation H is now being applied liberally to you.
381349,TJQ,2009-09-09 18:54:00,7806,"LOL.. the ""winternet""...  I gotta remember that one.. and GB... I've got big shoulders..  yup one more year of this I can retire on social assistance.."
381353,timmeh,2009-09-09 18:58:00,609,"  You're right on, this is the exact problem as to why some fishing questions aren't answered. People lurk around, read reports and take and take and take but offer nothing back. They want to know exactly where to go, what to use to catch fish. Instead of doing the leg work they expect someone else to do it for them.  The other problem is the silly season is beginning. Everyone wants to catch the big ""salmons and trouts"" in the rivers but instead of actually going out and fishing for them they sit in front of their computer instead.  Like you said when people ask for beginners help and tips it's fine, and people will help. But when people ask for specific info, about locations especially, you have to understand most people don't want to give their hotspots out over the internet."
381357,Governator,2009-09-09 19:03:00,879,"  nothing to see here, carry on carry on"
381358,Nemo,2009-09-09 19:09:00,727,"Looks like an early fall...  Man I have been hanging around here for years and taking notes on all the spots and still haven't caught anything. Maybe I should give up and start hitting the automotive sites.  FWIW most people just like reading the posts and the seeing the fish porn. They are not trying to corner the fish market with insider info.  If you don't like it remember what they say... ""You should have been here yesterday!""  Bonne Chance"
381360,Terry,2009-09-09 19:12:00,14456,"yup this isn't everyone's cup of tea, hope you find a new home that suits you better   but but like any Community there are good days and bad days good guys and bad guys  jokers and serious people who only want to see post about fishing  some of us if we don't  take or meds, we can get out of hand  some people will always jump on others about how/where/why they fish/how they hold the fish/and release the fish but that's life on every board...  but if you   hold a dead muskie/bass on shore with it's faded dead eyes, do say you caught it trolling and released it or only had it on a stringer to take a picture...or you will get people jumping on you  don't tell people you went fishing by yourself and after a while put a minnow on you second rod to see if that would work while pitching top water, then get upset change you story and get all pissy ..you will get jumped on   if you ask a question and someone takes the time to dug out the old photo, scan it upload it and give you the info you were looking for...say thank you..or don't be surprised if he has a negative reply on your next topic ..  if you ask about an area to fish and someone gives the names of some lake where you want to fish..say thank you...don't just leave that thread dead and start another one asking for info on them lakes, then wonder why no one wants to respond to you or give a negative reply to your next post..  in most cases you get what you give   make a point to acknowledge people who have resounded to you question  ....  oh and lots of people will make a post on your thread that has nothing to do with your topic and you get mad but they were helping you..they couldn't answer your question but by posting on your thread it brought it bak to the top so more people would see your question   hey where is the OFC COMMUNITY song...... we need it here"

381471,Spiel,2009-09-09 22:37:00,9065," I've never understood the reasoning behind one's need to announce their displeasure before they depart. Is there something to be gained by this?    You've mentioned this before. If it annoys you, you could always start up your own fishing message forum and format it any way that pleases you."
381476,misfish,2009-09-09 22:44:00,29133, Thats been done before. Didnt work as I recall.
381233,bigredfisher,2009-09-09 14:41:00,300,"I would like to know what happened to the OFC board. This used to be a great board with lots of info. Now all it is is a place to run people down when they ask a question. Comeon people come on this board wanting to get some info and that is what it was made for. Now everone is afraid to make a post asking a question without getting run down. I will no longer be visting for a while because this has got to be too much. I post a question about my car even and get run down what the hell is with that. This board needs a serious ""clean up"" and untill then i will be sticking to ************  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH"

The board can run great for long periods of time and then for a few weeks, not so great.. its funny... wait till xmas around here... and big red... your more than free to frequent any message board you like.  Id prefer it, (and I edited your post...) if you wouldn't purposely send people to another board.. that's just not good karma.. or good etiquette."

381249,bigredfisher,2009-09-09 15:03:00,300,i post all the time. i think that people know me pretty good around here. I see that everyone responds to guys who have 1 post and asking questions about where to go.
381250,TJQ,2009-09-09 15:05:00,7806,LOL.. OFC is not going anywhere...  there's not alot of other boards that even come close to the traffic this one has.. and with that high volume of users/traffic there are always issues...  I've been at this for close to ten years now and I've seen it all.  Bashers come and Bashers go... we do the best we can.
381251,Fishnwire,2009-09-09 15:05:00,983,"I don't like it either when posters feel the need to make a comment that adds absolutely nothing of value to the thread.  I think in this case they offered what little advice they could.  They could have been a little nicer about it, but saying you were ""run down"" might be being slightly oversensitive.  I'm pretty sure the crack about your car never having any power to start with was meant as a friendly joke.  Basically nobody could offer you any particularily useful advice, and that's that.  Hopefully you won't stay away long.  Cheers and tight lines."

The thing about the growing membership is it adds more resources(more people, more experience) But you get  's too...  You need to learn to filter a bit, and knowing who is actually a wealth of knowledge vs. a Joker vs. an  Takes time, and patronage to the board. Like it or not you take your fate in your own hands when you take advice on this board...unless you know who is who. Like wise there is no reason to get upset at comments thrown your way unless you know the latter. (stix and stones bud...) Of course there are some who will bash, but they come and go, and IMO the inconvenience is vastly outweighed by the good folks, and buckets of knowledge they have to share.  I hope you change you mind, and put some time in deciphering the good from the bad, as its worth it in the end. Cheers,"

381266,perchslayer666,2009-09-09 16:00:00,280,"I’m a lurker that has been viewing the board for the past 3-4 years, and I must say there are lots (too much) nit-pickers on this board that like to show off they’re knowledge more than an actual fishing report contributions, and it really does bring down the quality of the threads. My advise to Bigredfisher, is if you’re looking for information, use the search tool, and you’ll have several years of reports for your viewing, and you don’t have to deal with the Online Fishing board Nazi’s that threaten the genuine fishing attitude and make-up that this board at one time had.  Tip – If you want less idiot posters (one on this thread already) simply do not respond to them, don’t fuel the fire, and they’ll stop or better yet go away for good. It’s simple message board economics, lol   Oh ya BTW - I don’t post here because I don’t have to, but I did join because more members give more $$ to the mods, and they deserve it for this undertaking that is OFC."

Damn THAT'S IT, I'm so tired of idiot question askers ignoring answers they don't want to hear or skip entirely because they're too busy with sand in their mangina's.

I don't mean to come across rude with this but at the end of the day this is a fishing board and were all not licensed mechanics.  I simply had no idea what a oz sensor is (or whatever it's called) so I didn't reply.  You got several good replys there for a pretty complicated question.  You mentioned people reply to the guys with 1 post and tell them where to go, well that's simply because most of us can answer a fishing question here and direct them.  Just my 2 cents, don't sweat the litttle stuff!"

381309,cuzza,2009-09-09 17:54:00,467," Not singling you out but aren't people like you the root of the problem? Those who are prepared to sign up (not sure about the mods getting any $$ for it) and take what they want from others without giving anything back?  I understand people not wanting to say ""fish here, with this bait, at this depth, on this rig"" as trying things out is how you learn and become more competent but I can also see how it could be interpreted as unhelpful."
