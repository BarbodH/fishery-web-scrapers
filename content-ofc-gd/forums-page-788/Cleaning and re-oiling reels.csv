First time I tried I couldn't get the braking mechanism back in place in my Daiwa...ended up taking it to a local bait and tackle store for repairs...  Spinning reels are a bit less complicated...

Wiser's video is the perfect demonstration for cleaning reels, only difference I use Reel Butter. BTW, going to a dealer could cost a pretty penny if you have a few reels, call first."
