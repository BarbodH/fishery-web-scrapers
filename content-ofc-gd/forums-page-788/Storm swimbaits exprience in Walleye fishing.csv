382983,bigreddog,2009-09-14 16:17:00,84,"Not sure that I would consider this a ""favourite,"" since I've only used the one, but I've caught walleye in the past with the Storm Wildeye Live Goby, which I presume is a swimbait of sorts.  Since gobies and sculpin are found mostly along lake and river bottoms (use it areas where gobies have been reported), it's fairly easy to fish:  Chuck it out, and drag it slowly back along the bottom.  It's not something I'll regularly include in my arsenal, but that's just me and my preference for light, versatile tackle."
382985,backbay,2009-09-14 16:36:00,773,"Sorry I can't reply as far as walleye are concerned, Behnam, but the 4"" fire tiger kickin' minnow was great for bass and especially pike all summer. I'm going to get one of the larger versions for the fall season. They're pretty reasonably priced, too."
383000,GBW,2009-09-14 17:30:00,8460,i like these 2 the best.   just cast out and bring back nice and slow...
383006,Dabluz,2009-09-14 17:58:00,701,"I've tried some of those jigs with soft minnow bodies made by Storm.  Yes, the walleye seem to like them but the hooks are too heavy to my liking.  You really have to strike hard to sink the hook past the barb.  Since I usually use 4 or 6 lb mono on a fast action medium light rod, I have not had much luck hooking walleye with those jigs.  So far I get better results using 1/8 to 1/4 ounce bare jigs baited with a nightcrawler."
383011,Kinger,2009-09-14 18:16:00,351,"Won't have to gut any of the walleyes, those hooks will do a fine job of that."
383033,leighfns,2009-09-14 19:34:00,103,I use berkley hand pour swimbaits and they seem to work well for the walleye..   Slow steady retrieve with pauses every now and then.  Still prefer to use crankbaits or spinnerbaits though
