I found these boats to be very cheap. a 21 footer with a 96"" beam, with 115hp, trailer, top, only for 27k? what's the catch? (Outlander 2010T) I realize 27k for a boat this size you cannot expect the same as the ones where you pay 65k. But I am looking for the areas where one would have to compromise on when paying for this boat.  it only weighs 1400 pounds.. that's is feather weight for a boat that length and width.  that might be an issue, when in big chopy waters.  Does anybody own a polar kraft?"
