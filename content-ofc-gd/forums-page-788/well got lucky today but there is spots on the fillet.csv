I baged up the spotted fillets on there  own just in case this means they are no good
382838,GBW,2009-09-14 02:04:00,8460,"cut them out if you want to, you are fine."
382844,pike slayer,2009-09-14 02:12:00,1177,"i believe they are some type of parasite but they are more of a skin thing and dont normall go deep into the actual meat. i cant say for sure what it is but ive been told you can eat fish like that with no problems, ive been eating them like that for years and i still feel fine!"
382845,GBW,2009-09-14 02:16:00,8460,"fish get worms, that is what it is.  warm water = worms in fish not in the deep colder water.  if you see spots on the fish when you catch it and it should not have those spots, it's got worms..."
382848,pike slayer,2009-09-14 02:27:00,1177,"worms in a fish are like yellowly, brown, white rice looking things in the flesh arent they?"
382849,GBW,2009-09-14 02:31:00,8460,i've seen darker and told it was worms.  but i'm no expert by far...
382855,fishing,2009-09-14 02:56:00,167,"http://www.ene.gov.on.ca/publications/590b14.pdf Please see Page 15, ""Black spot"".  It also appears in fins and sometime in scales. So sometimes we can see black spots before skin the fish. Some of fish, like yellow perch and pike, from warm shallow ponds have the black spot. Much less in cold, deep and clean water."
382856,bigugli,2009-09-14 02:59:00,6138,"The yellowy spots  in the flesh are the live parasite. The black spot is the remnant after they die. Both are absolutely harmless to humans. Cook your fish properly and all is good. The warmer and shallower the water is in which a fish resides, the greater the number of little yellow worms."

383125,misfish,2009-09-14 23:06:00,29133,"Sounds like a shallow warm pond, for catch and release to me.  Fish eat worms,not humans.EEEEEEK"

383301,Jonny,2009-09-15 03:08:00,1380,"Fillets should be clean, clear meat. Regardless of whether anybody says you can eat suspect fillets, I personally wouldn't."
