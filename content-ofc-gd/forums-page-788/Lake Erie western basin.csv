Some of the bigger fish are starting to return with some larger 6-10# being caught. We are still running harnesses as the water has not cooled off too much yet. Fished Leamington today boating 18 walleyes in 2 passes. No real pattern on colour but speed was key with strongs winds blowing today a drift sock made it more managable. "
