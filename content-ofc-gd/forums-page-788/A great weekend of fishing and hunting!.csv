I have spent the last eight weeks off due to surgery and was thrilled to get back out side, fishing and hunting.  The weekend started Friday in Ridgeway hunting for geese... The day after opening season they were already flying high and hesitant in landing amoung our decoys, however we did manage two in the couple of hours that we stayed out.   My First Goose of the Season  Steve and Zoe, Always great hunting partners  On Saturday Steve was Running his 3rd Annual Walleye Hunters Tournament... with the way fishing has been on Lake Erie this year the turnout was good, by mid morning we were dealing with a six foot chop, and no fish... Steve decided to head into shallow water where we managed to pick up a couple of fish putting us third in the Tournament...   We placed third with two fish in Fishmasters Walleye Hunters Tournament on Saturday  First Fish  Second Fish  The weekend was a great one!  Thank you so much to Steve for including me not only Friday for Hunting but Saturday as part of his team...  Cheers,  jen ( Bernadette)"
