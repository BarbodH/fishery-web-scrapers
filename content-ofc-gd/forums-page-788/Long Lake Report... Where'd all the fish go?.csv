383218,wask,2009-09-15 01:55:00,174," This if my first photo report and probably my last full day of fishing for the season.  I was at Long Lake, in the Kawartha Highlands near Apsley.  Last time I was here was two years ago and I had an incredible day.  Hauled in three largemouth over 3 pounds and a small mouth that was almost five pounds.  These pics shocked me at the quality since they were taken with my Blackberry Storm.    I rolled out of bed to semi-sunny skies in Peterborough, but as I traveled further toward Apsley, the skies were looking pretty bleak.  In fact the temperature had dropped to 15 (18 in Ptbo) and even was spitting rain on my as I traveled up highway 28.  Needless to say I wasn't thrilled.  When I got to the boat launch, this is what it looked like...    Since the weatherman said it was going to be 23 and sunny, I was sorely disappointed.  With the chop on the water, courtesy of the breeze, I decided to run to Apsley to pick up a long sleeve shirt, presumably the only XL that was for sale in town today and it looked like two stores were open.  After picking up some warmth, I headed back to the lake to launch.  It was still a little dreary, but if you've been to the Kawartha Highlands, it is always a place full of stunning scenery.      Naturally, I was heading into the wind, going three horses strong in my 12 ft. tinner.  I puttered around and realized fighting the chop was going to be a battle all day.    I fished around in the small bay near the marina and found nothing that the fish or I liked.  I headed up the main body of the lake, and after about an hour, the Lord finally decided to give me a glimpse of sunlight.    After fshing away the morning, I came to the portage to Buzzard Lake      The guy at the store told me it was 540 meters from lake to lake, so I counted it by steps... right around 500 steps for me... I don't think my stride is a meter?  Here are some more pics of Buzzard...         I left the portage and headed a little further north to where Long turns into Loucks Lake with the plan to let the wind drift my back the way I had come, fishing as I go.  I pulled out the bait caster and promptly got some action...    There was one bright spot in the experience to this point...    I brought along an old spool of Berkley TriMax, 17lb test I had picked up in a huge lot of line off of ebay that I had bought for some old wood spools that were included, with this being a bonus.  I stripped off the old 12lb test line and set up to spool my bait caster on the water.  I find this to be a really neat setup from this spool of line, it has a clip on case so you can just clip it on your rod and reel.  Makes things easier for sure, I'll be using this for spooling from now on...    As i drifted along, I finally got some bots on old reliable, the smoke colored senko.  One lucky cast, wait... wait... set the hook and...    That pretty much summed up the day.  I did catch a half dozen more, none more than a pound.  I need to do some reading on finding bass in the wind because it really made for a huge challenge for the day.  I headed in early, my flat bottom 12 footer wasn't made to deal with the wind, so when it picked up, I packed up.   All in all it was a great day, as is any day spent on the water as opposed to spent in the cubicle...       [/size]  "
383226,scuro2,2009-09-15 02:06:00,904,We've all had a day like that. Thanks for posting...I like the map so that I can get a sense of the landscape in that area.
383227,Rizzo,2009-09-15 02:06:00,4754,"some great looking photos, especially from a blackberry! Who needs a camera?"
383388,wask,2009-09-15 12:54:00,174," No doubt.  It has a 3.3 MP camera and I knew it was decent, but I really feel like it was great.  I'm shocked.  I almost dropped it over the side a couple of times, which would have been bad... ha."
383418,johnnyb,2009-09-15 13:47:00,3413,"Sounds like a pretty good report...but I'm at work and can't see the pics   Will check 'em out when I get home...I've got the same bb camera, and it's amazing! Just curious...you portaged the tinner?  By yourself? My $0.02 for the wind troubles --> DRIFT SOCK!  Sooo worth it"
383421,wask,2009-09-15 13:58:00,174,"Yeah, wasn't clear on that.  I just walked the portage to check it out, didn't actually portage.  I stayed on long.  I'm thinking of a way to put wheels on my boat, but that is a project for the winter or something.  That would be a one man portage though with wheels on the boat.  "
383423,solopaddler,2009-09-15 14:08:00,8605,Cool report and beautiful scenery thanks. Trimax hasn't been around for years. 18-19 years ago it was my favourite line and incredibly expensive. I was sad to see it discontinued. Be interesting to see if line that old holds up.
383449,wask,2009-09-15 15:44:00,174,"  I didn't actually catch any fish on it, but from everything I've seen from casting and getting snagged up yesterday, it is still fine.  I think I have 2 or 3 more rolls of it too."
383462,Greencoachdog,2009-09-15 16:33:00,8163,That was a great report for your day out!!!  Thanks for taking the time to post it!!!
