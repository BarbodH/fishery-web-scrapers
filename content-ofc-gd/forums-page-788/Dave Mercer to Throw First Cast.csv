Mods please don't shut down the trash talkers my only question to them is HOW MUCH will they be donating to Cancer that day? If they wish we would love to have them sit in the Facts of Fishing section with me and maybe I can give them a hug as it sounds like that is what they need lol!  LOVE ALWAYS HUGS AND KISSES! Dave"
383165,Roy,2009-09-15 00:30:00,13728, What I like about this whole thing aside from the fact that some help will be generated for the fight against cancer is that for the first time in history will the sport of baseball  be elevated to our niveau!
