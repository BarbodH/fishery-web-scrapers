381696,Dutchy,2009-09-10 03:44:00,416,"Yar, I go to get me one of those winter hats as well."
381822,TJQ,2009-09-10 15:32:00,7806,I guess I better order some in!!
382061,Greencoachdog,2009-09-11 02:11:00,8163,"If you can get TJ into enough Moonshine, they're free!!!.. but don't tell Monique!!!"
382080,Twocoda,2009-09-11 02:53:00,4130,if i buy two hats ...do i get a vest crest for free ???
382239,aplumma,2009-09-11 19:36:00,6896,Someone found that if you wrestle T.J. to the ground you can get a free shirt with $5.00 in the front pocket.       Art
382318,skinny,2009-09-11 23:48:00,442,cool stuff by chance wil they take paypal as my credit card is in the freezer
382319,misfish,2009-09-11 23:50:00,29133,"Gots to put some flames on them hats,cause OFC is HOT."
382321,TJQ,2009-09-11 23:55:00,7806,"LOL.. Oll get some ""hot"" ones made...  and ya.. i can take paypal."
382327,Roy,2009-09-12 00:01:00,13728,"  I will also accept pay, PAL!"
382331,misfish,2009-09-12 00:21:00,29133, eh??????
382368,HTHM,2009-09-12 02:03:00,4082,I would rather wrestle Monique than TJ to the ground.... There is a line crossed in there somewhere...
382524,aplumma,2009-09-12 21:37:00,6896,  T.J. is much easier to wrestle he has lots of hair to hold on too. Besides if Monique don't want to wrestle it would be like trying to shave a wildcat in a phone booth I think.   Art
382525,misfish,2009-09-12 22:01:00,29133,"Just think,TJ VS,,,,,,,,The ANIMAL       VS   "

382560,misfish,2009-09-13 00:52:00,29133," Manly? Manly? Did you say manly? I,ll show you manly. SRY this is a family site.LOL"
382649,Spiel,2009-09-13 12:50:00,9065,  I think you mean manely....
382664,aplumma,2009-09-13 14:22:00,6896,shhhhh looks like the fuzz showed up. hide the beers and the pot so we don't get busted..... I havent had to said that since the 80's      art
