382609,Leecher,2009-09-13 04:06:00,7832,"Today was such a beautiful day that Paul and I decided to hit one of our local lakes for Bass.  The plan was to spend the afternoon on the water and get back out at sundown... Did not get a temperature reading before we left but the wind was pretty calm coming from the West.  Got to the launch and noticed Fishing 24/7 aka Kevin's truck was already there.  Got the boat launched and proceeded to the hump in the middle of the lake and did not get much out of this attempt, a few little ones on spinnerbait and bigO.  We then proceeded to work the shore line with Gulp and got rewarded with this decent one    We kept working at it without much showing for our efforts  but the bite was real tough compared to the last time we were out on this lake     the water was low with the weeds decaying making the water tainted with lots of debris on top.  We tried working around the many islands and at this point switched to a yellow red eye spinnerbait.... got a few little ones but that was it.  We then hit one of the bays and switched to Gulp again and got into a frenzy for a short time.  Managed to land a 16 1/2"" one.... here's the pic    and another shot    Paul also got a decent one    On our way to another bay, a family of loons (7 of them) were out on the hunt.... got a pic of them    After that we switched to top water lures, jitterbug and buzzbait and tried until sundown but the bass were no where to be found.  Back at the launch is where the adventure began.... We saw Kevin leave with his truck and proceeded ourselves to the launch.... I don't want to get into details cause I don't know if Paul wants to talk about it but the frame of the car got stuck on a rock and took us 2.5 hours to get the car and boat out of the water  Hope you enjoy Leechman"

Tell Paul that Rednecks tow their boats with pickup trucks for a reason!  ... and you can tell us the rest of the story, I don't think Paul will mind!  Thanks for taking the time to post your adventure!!!"

382653,Fishing 24/7,2009-09-13 12:55:00,709,Well GCD.  if your going to ask....  today was stephanies day out.  she chooses what we do all day.  she manedged to get some nice numbers.  to start with she caught her first bass on the flip.    Then there was a bass i missed earlier just when we arived .  i pitched a log and a seriouse bass fallowed the lure right to the boat but i guess we were to close.  i marked the spot and we fished 4-5 houres.  then we came back.  Put this in your brain. when you see a big one come back he will still be right there.  this happened a couple of times.  with out a dought. she flips the same log.( a pefect cast might i add)  and BOOM. he takes the lure!      4.2 large mouth bass. (not her personnal best) but didnt want to miss it.  I lipped the bass right out of the water. she was saying .  manque les pas .manque les pas .manque les pas .manque les pas .manque les pas .manque les pas .manque les pas .manque les pas .manque les pas .  it was a hard day out on a great lake . but with the nice weather and the odd fish who cares!
