PS - I'm wading and dragging a drop shot  I have not had a lot of line breaks with it, it is stretchy but now reading reviews, people seem to dog it.  Please advise."
383009,Guest gbfisher,2009-09-14 18:06:00,0,I switched from Power Pro to spider wire Stealth due to line snaps. Havent had any with Spider wire. Stuff is golden. Thats with 80 lb test though. I know a few Musky guides who use it as well.
