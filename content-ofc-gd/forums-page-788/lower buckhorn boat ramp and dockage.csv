382162,smally21,2009-09-11 13:26:00,993,"so i rented this cottage on the mississauga river about 1km from buckhorn.  river was navigable in my 18' stratos but BARELY.  did it a couple times and decided not worth it and decided to find a spot at the local marina or resort for the week.  so this casey fella at sunrise resort moves a bunch of boats to make room for me last minute, gives me a great spot and then proceeds to charge me peanuts for the week.  so just a good word for this guy helped me out use his ramp if you're up that way its only 10 bucks."
382187,Billy Bob,2009-09-11 15:17:00,5865,ONLY $10 to launch your boat.......     I am guessing you get a lunch with this launch...Right....  It nice to hear you found someone to tend to your needs but $10 for to launch your boat IMHO is waterway robbery....
382192,johnnyb,2009-09-11 15:44:00,3413,"You would think so, BillyBob, but...$10 in (Ontario) cottage country is a bargain!  Was up at a completely out of the way little lake a couple weeks back, one little trailer park on the lake and a few cottages...buddy wanted $30 to launch...which is expected for the big waterways. Thanks for the tip smally21....how was the fishing?"
382196,Billy Bob,2009-09-11 15:58:00,5865,I rented a cottage on Stoney in late June and had to launch near Pine Vista resort and only paid $6. The launch wasn't owned by the resort but rather a store owner right by the launch but parking was extra (don't know how much).
382222,Lunker777,2009-09-11 18:24:00,866,Thats awsome he helped ya out !!!  $30 to launch ???????????????? Holy crap !  I dont pay a thing if I launch at my usuall spot... but then I have to motor across the bay which takes about 10 mins in my boat.... or I could launch across the bay and pay $5 on one side of the marina.... or theres another launch right across the marina and I would pay $13 hahah The 2 launches are literally ACROSS from each other in the marina... ones 5 bucks and the other over double that ! The great thing is... on busy weekends... the more expensive launch in the one thats always backed up. I remember on weekend... there was probably 15 people waiting to launch.... we pulled around to the other side and dropped right in !
382235,johnnyb,2009-09-11 19:25:00,3413,"Oh yeah...I never did pay the $30...we drove up the road, found a spot to park and hand-bombed it in   One day, when I have a bigger boat, I'll miss my little tinner"
382248,smally21,2009-09-11 20:23:00,993,"i,m not interested in hearing what a sucker i am for paying for a boat ramp.  the posting is about a guy helping me out and now you are accusing him of robbing me. -"
382535,Lunker777,2009-09-12 22:47:00,866, I hope your not directing that towards me.... I said it was great he helped ya out  I also commented that $30 to launch a boat is ridiculous ! If you dont agree with me.....then I wish I had your bank account !
382706,Billy Bob,2009-09-13 17:18:00,5865, You're the first one to mention the cost of the launch.......
382716,smally21,2009-09-13 18:34:00,993, is this not what you said? i offered a nice guy some props and you accuse him of robbing me? anyhow i shouldn't be namecalling just wasn't the response i expected.  ive edited the post with apologies.
382745,Radnine,2009-09-13 20:42:00,1538, Thanks for the tip. I know that the thread is not about debating the cost of doing business but 10 bucks is more than fair. Jim
382766,Billy Bob,2009-09-13 22:30:00,5865,So I have to ask......is there no FREE boat launches on these lakes as in access sites or parks with boat launches. We have pretty much free launches on just about every lake in NY or at least State Parks with boat launches. But in the event you must pay to launch here it's only $5- $7.  Isn't this where some of the fishing license money should be going ?  In NYS it does.
382956,Andy,2009-09-14 15:07:00,330,"As far as I'm  concerned, $10.00 is a small price to pay for a launch that will get your boat in and out without problems. All it would take is one small scrape or ding on the boat or trailer at a less than adequate launch and I'd curse myself for not spending the $10.00."
382961,Raf,2009-09-14 15:21:00,3495,"there are many free launches, most are gov't run, on larger bodies of water.  what is being talked about here are private launches."
382978,charlesn,2009-09-14 15:58:00,551,"I do not know of a public free launch on Lower Buckhorn.  The two I've always used a marina in Deer Bay and Sunrise Resort are fee-based and not a rip off as at least the ramps are somewhat maintained.  Have used a few ""free"" ramps in my time and the damage to the trailer and inconvenience factor make the $10 well worth it.  The guy at Sunrise is a great fellow.  Very friendly and helpful.  Would recommend that ramp to anyone."
