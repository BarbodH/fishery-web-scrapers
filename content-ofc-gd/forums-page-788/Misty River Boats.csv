150717,fishinggeek,2008-01-14 16:21:00,325,"Misty River boats look interesting.  Anyone have any opinions on them, either positive or negative?  Too bad they weren't at the boat show this week."
150777,GbayGiant,2008-01-14 20:35:00,1780,"I haven't seen any new ones but the old tinnies they made I see a lot of, they hold up good, the name brand isn't popular but  they've been around for a long time so they can't be too bad."
150780,mistyriver1,2008-01-14 20:46:00,600,I like em  I can't comment on the newer ones either but mine's an 89 and I'm very happy with it.  She's a wide and deep hull handles the choppy water very well.  
150797,fishinggeek,2008-01-14 21:16:00,325,"Thanks MR and GBG for the input, and keep them coming please.  What really intrigued me is the composite flooring.  I would want a boat to last as long as possible, and the idea of plywood in rain, sun, snow, and whatever else we put our boats through doesn't sound that good.  Plus a retired boat dealer told me that was the brand he would choose if he were me.  He said they had the fewest problems of the different boats he saw in his many years working."
150832,GbayGiant,2008-01-14 22:26:00,1780,"If I could get a new boat I think it would be a Stanley or similar. Welded aluminum, no paint ever just chrome, no wood ever and snap in carpet = no maintenance and looks good forever. Just pressure wash it once a year and clean or replace the carpet in minutes."
150842,woodro,2008-01-14 22:55:00,168,"I've heard many good things about these boats. Canadian made with Lifetime warranty is always a good thing in my opinion. It all depend on what you're planning on using the boat for ie. species of fish, body of water fishing, tiller or console. GBay Giant has mentioned another extremely good boat that will last you a lifetime. Stanley boats are no Bull boat but esthetically not very pleasing. Stanley boats  The numer one Aluminum boat made in the industry for quality, durability and esthetics in my opinion is Harbercraft. The gauge of aluminum used for the hauls of these boats is twice as thick as Misty River, Lund, Legend, and Tracker. The thick gauged aluminum combined with the one piece haul construction makes this boat virtually indestructible. If you have a chance check it out this week at the show, I'm pretty sure they're there. I remember seeing them last year."
150846,kuhaman,2008-01-14 23:02:00,503,Im sure they are probably great boats(They are one of Italo Labignons sponsers) but in my opinion nuthin beats a Lund.
150863,pikehunter,2008-01-14 23:26:00,1659," Yep, they are built like a tank, solid and welded heavy heavy heavy gauge aluminum. But expensive! If I could afford one then sure Stanley would be a consideration. But if you are going to spend that much then think about a Lund, Crestliner, Polar Kraft or Princecraft and get more bells and whistles!"
150879,Gerritt,2008-01-14 23:43:00,6129,Mmmmm Polar kraft.... now were talking!  G
150923,linweir,2008-01-15 01:09:00,202,Alumicraft maybe. I will consider Boston Whaler as #1 big water boat.
150924,Grimace,2008-01-15 01:14:00,2020,I like those Custom Weld boats with the jets.   I saw them at the show and I was really impressed.   Lots of coin though.   they even have cab heat
382606,John Bacon,2009-09-13 03:47:00,3277,"Does anybody know the Misty River website, or a dealer in the GTA area?  I am interested in their boats but cannot seem to find much on the web about them."
382657,Terry,2009-09-13 14:03:00,14456,  SPAM  LOL
