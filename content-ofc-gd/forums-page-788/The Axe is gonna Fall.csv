381593,Spiel,2009-09-10 01:22:00,9065,"I suspect that there are many here who have never read the following and some who clearly need to be reminded.  The Rules  We'll keep it simple. Be nice and be respectful. Like your Mom probably told you, if you have nothing nice to say, then say nothing at all.  Debate is encouraged, but please follow the basic guidelines of debate. No name calling. Back up your claims with proof. Don't get your knickers in a knot if someone disagrees. KEEP IT CIVIL!  Things that will not be tolerated. Flaming, baiting, name calling, prejudice, racism, swearing, spam, and general boorishness.  Deleted or locked posts. If you disagree with a moderators decision to lock or delete a post, send them a Personal Message. DO NOT make a post complaining about it. We have opened the forums to children so we expect you to show them how adults should behave.  Spam will get you banned faster than anything else. Spam is any unsolicited business ad or offer. If someone happens to ask about a product or service you may offer, then you are of course free to mention it. If you come in here and spam, you will be given a pretty rude welcome by the population and it will only hurt your business! We have very reasonable ad rates and can set you up very quickly.Contact TJQ for ad rates.  We would prefer that you do not post pictures of fish caught out of season.  Please do not post VERY SPECIFIC information on fishing spots, ie pinpoint locations and maps. It is our belief that sharing this type of knowledge to the general public is not at all good for the resource itself. When communicating info on spots, please keep it to email or a PM.  Please do not post copyrighted material. Please keep your avatars tasteful and not degrading or insulting to any race, sex, religion or political entity.  One image in a signature is allowed. Images in signatures must not be greater than 500 pixels wide and 75 pixels in height. Signature images must not be more than 100K in file size. Its OK to have a link to a website in your signature line, but if you do so it is mandatory to have a prominent link back to www.ofncommunity.com on the site.  Signatures must also conform to language and content guidelines. If you post is not about fishing please put ""NF"" at the end of the subject thread!  If your post contains hunting images that may offend some, please note Hunting Images in your post description.  We have a group of Administrators and Moderators all here to help you out.If you have any questions, ask us!  Troublemakers will be warned and then if that doesn't work, placed on a Mod Queue. This means every post you make will need to be approved before it is visible. If being in mod queue doesn't help, offenders will be banned.  Posting profanity, (swearing) is not permitted (this includes video)! Neither is the use of creative spelling or the use of characters to get around the swear filters. Offending posts will be deleted! We have children on the site, so behave accordingly.  Get together threads may be requested to be pinned, but no longer than 30 days before the event.

381630,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-10 01:55:00,3761,"You mod's must be busy because flaming goes on here every day as well as the first line saying if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all.  Not hard to follow so I'll be good for now on i guess. However, if this stupid Scugog River doesn't start to produce I might get into the ""adult"" mode and be a pain in the butt."
382119,Spiel,2009-09-11 11:23:00,9065, I would delete your bogus TJ Quesnel account but then TJ would have to delete his bogus Daplumma account.

Perhaps we would all benefit from being shown what a ""flame"", an off-colour, or racially insensitive post actually looks like. I can guarantee that the people doing it don't think that they are doing anything wrong (perhaps even me included!?!). Jim"
