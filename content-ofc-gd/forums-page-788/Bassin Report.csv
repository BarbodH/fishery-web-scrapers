We did quite well with both lm and sm. The bass were caught on texas rigged powerbaits, spinner baits and Yum dingers. Water was approx 72F and fish were caught at various depths, from 3fow to 17fow.  First fish of the day. Action shot of a nice sm     Biggest bass for us that day.   Some other bass we caught during the day.  "
