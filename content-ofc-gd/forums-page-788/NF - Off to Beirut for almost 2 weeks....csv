382668,ccmtcanada,2009-09-13 14:36:00,7971,This time I hope to have a fishing report!  I'm being sent back for work...but will be there over a weekend this time.  I've looked into fishing charters and will be booking one as soon as I land.  They have assured me they have lots of space left.  We'll be targeting Amberjacks in the Mediterranean Sea.  Good fishing everyone!  I'll be following the board from overseas...

If the family needs ANYTHING while you are away, all they have to do is call or if Bly and Sydney want to come up fishing, we'd love to have them, they don't even have to bring their rods, I've got more than enough!"

Be prepared to have your arms pulled out of the sockets at the shoulder... and you may be sore for a day or two after if they put you on the big ones (30+ lbs)  Looking forward to another one of your great reports!!!
