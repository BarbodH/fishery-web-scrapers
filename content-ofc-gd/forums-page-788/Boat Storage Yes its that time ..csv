382414,mrpike,2009-09-12 04:13:00,151,Well it is that time of year again. I am looking for boat storage for my boat and I am sure others are also . Some need outdoor and some like it indoors for their boats . I myself like indoors for my boat . IF anyone out there knows of a place that offers both in and outdoor storage can they please post it . THE name of the place a number to call and the location would help a lot of people out this fall .  I would also like to know just what you all think is a fare price for boat storage should be . ( indoor or outdoor )  per month.   THANKS MR PIKE.
382429,Guest skeeter99,2009-09-12 06:42:00,0,  $150 for outdoor storage / winter nov to may  $200 to $250 for indoor storage/ winter nov to may  at least that is what they are charging in the durham region
382459,wmshaw,2009-09-12 13:53:00,42,"  Are the prices quotes for a season or are those monthly prices.  When I had my boat last year, my dealer in Markham quoted $150 a month for heated indoor storage.  Bill"
382537,Guest skeeter99,2009-09-12 23:13:00,0,  no those are season price
382546,danbouck,2009-09-13 00:07:00,4380,Storage??? not for a few more months
382571,Alumacraft,2009-09-13 01:54:00,139,Mine's never been winterized or stored for the winter  
382654,John Bacon,2009-09-13 13:26:00,3277,  Why would anyone want heated storage for a boat?  There is nothing on a boat that will be harmed by freezing.
382685,danbouck,2009-09-13 15:30:00,4380, I believe there is quite a few things that can be damaged if not properly stored or winterized.
382700,bassfighter,2009-09-13 16:49:00,366,craig list has one for $25 per month outdoor at hamilton area.  new market john 905-836-6321 20 or 25/month  905 473 5288 gord 25 per month pefferlaw
382702,HTHM,2009-09-13 16:54:00,4082,I have room in the Hamilton area for outdoor storage. $150.00 for the season.
382740,smally21,2009-09-13 20:27:00,993,"these all sound like great prices.  most outdoor i found in hamilton area was around 80/month, indoor around 100+/mnth and indoor heated was 150+/mnth.  prperly winterized and stored boats can be stored without heating, so i left it outside in the cold. i would love to have a heated spot so i could use it all year worry free, but lots of storage guys dont like you coming and going. Plus not to paint then all with the same brush but it can't be that unusual that they shut the heat off after they are full! good luck"
382769,Billy Bob,2009-09-13 22:37:00,5865,Put a add in the paper you will care for snow birds house while they sun bathe in Florida if you can store your boat in their garage for FREE. This has worked for me for the last 3 winters.....
382831,bow slayer,2009-09-14 01:46:00,1074,"If anyone needs storage in the London area,I pay only 75 bucks for the season for outdoor and it is covered by a carport,out of the sun and rain/snow. He has room for a couple more or did last year and for the price you can't go wrong.Anyone want more info let me know."
382832,Bondar,2009-09-14 01:51:00,817,  Exactly what i was thinking  Bring on the ice the boat is just coming out of storage LOL
382840,John Bacon,2009-09-14 02:06:00,3277, I didn't say not to winterize it.  I only said that they didn't need to be stored in a heated facility.  It just seems to be a waste to pay for all that heat all winter long.
382851,Pigeontroller,2009-09-14 02:42:00,2793,"Winter storage for me cost $17,000. Course, thats for life! Heated garage, handy place to work on the boat over the winter, ready to go anytime!!! "
382942,Fish4Eyes,2009-09-14 14:12:00,1022, If you can get prices that cheap I would be subcontracting out this type of service.
