383277,wask,2009-09-15 02:43:00,174,"What kind of waders?  What purpose?  There are so many kinds and uses, its hard to say.  69.99 for regular old rubber chest waders is a good deal.  If you are going cold water, Neoprene is probably what you want."
383285,rbaquial,2009-09-15 02:47:00,968,"Go with LLBEAN (LLBEAN.COM) They have an AMAZING selection... and they're decently priced too. BEST PART - They are ""LIFETIME WARRANTY""... ....Had a buddy gimme info on this a loong time back."

383296,timmeh,2009-09-15 02:59:00,609,"Honestly if you're barely using them just about any pair will do fine, no need to spend big $$ on something you use a couple times a year. Just make sure you take care of them. After you wear them don't stuff them back in the box, hang them up somewhere. Neoprene is an option but personally I don't like them. You can wear rubber one in cold water if you dress warmly and wear wool socks.  But if you really want to be comfortable breathable waders are the way to go... more money but worth it imo. And if you're comfortable you may find you use them more than planned."
383310,ironstone74,2009-09-15 03:35:00,201,Up until a few days ago I fished with 3mm neoprene waders.  They lasted about 11 years with light use.  I upgraded to Simms G3s which are pricey but should perform well.  I would recommend rubber or vinyl for the number of times you are planning on.  Neos are a level up and then Gore-Tex/ breathables are the cat's meow.  Paul
