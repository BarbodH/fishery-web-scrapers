186736,lunkerbasshunter,2008-04-14 00:40:00,2585,that is a great story!  one that you will never forget! not sure if t against the rules or not.  cheers!
186740,Greencoachdog,2008-04-14 00:45:00,8163,"That is a great story/read/pic Lew!!!  If you released the fish, you didn't do anything wrong in my book. Even technically, I say you brought the fish to the boat on your rod and reel and you stayed in the boat when you grabbed it. I don't think a fish has to pass over the gunwale on a hook to be legal.  Thanks again for the great read and pic!!!"
187010,wallyboss,2008-04-14 16:14:00,1095,"I am pretty sure that he saw that on FLW tour show on WFN last week or so. I think that the tourney rule is that you cannot get off your boat during the tounament. And that is why when he broke his line and saw it floating that he jumped in but kept one hand on his boat, to meet the rule."
187018,Reef Runner,2008-04-14 16:29:00,981,"I don't think you broke any rule out there, but could be wrong.  Seeing as it went back unharmed I see no issue.  I had a similar experience fighting a HUGE ski out of a canoe.  had to shore land'er and as soon as I got it close the hook popped out.  Hell, I jumped in the water with my shoes on and was cold, but not miserable, the whole day.  Good story and pics Lew, now to print T-shirts that say ""don't screw with Lew""  reefrunner"
187023,Carp,2008-04-14 16:34:00,1488,  My money is on the OFNer.   Great story L.
187057,POLLIWOGG,2008-04-14 17:21:00,835,"Its against the law to take a fish by hand, I'm surprised that everyone here doesn't know that.  Having said that, if you loose a walleye at the ice 9 times out of 10 you can reach in and grab it."
187060,Reef Runner,2008-04-14 17:32:00,981,"Good to know POLLIWOG.  Thanks for chiming in, as it only happened once to me I will be sure not to have it happen again.  Thanks again,  reefrunner"
187063,GBW,2008-04-14 17:38:00,8460,But can Lew catch a minnow with chopsticks like “Daniel-Son” did with a fly?  HAHA
187067,Gerritt,2008-04-14 17:44:00,6129,"  He can... Blind folded, with both arms tied behind his back while singing Kumbya  G"
186435,lew,2008-04-13 12:15:00,12767,"I was just reading iceguys post about the tourney angler jumping in the water to grab a fish after his line snapped, and they said he didn't break any rules cause he kept his hand on the boat at all times.  It reminded me of a musky I got several years ago under similar circumstances, but I've often wondered if I broke a rule.  It was back in the days before I used a net to land muskies and always just grabbed them by the gill plate to bring them in.  It was very late at night and we were casting  large spinner baits in shallow water when I got her. I had her right beside the boat and was holding my rod high to keep tension on the line, and just as I reached down to grab her with my free hand, the hook popped outta her mouth and she started to take off.  Without even thinking, I grabbed for her when she was about 3 feet away and taking off in a hurry and darned near fell outta the boat, but I was able to get her by the tail and haul her back into the boat for a picture.  'She was a thin fish and not real long so I don't know why I went to so much trouble for a picture, but maybe it was just a reflex action or something   .  Anyways, I originally hooked her legally, but she managed to escape, and I then more or less caught her again by hand without using a fishin pole and I've always felt what I did was against the rules.......any thoughts ??  "
186438,Gerritt,2008-04-13 12:32:00,6129,I think it is a great story to tell the grand kids Lew.  I see nothing wrong with it.. reflexes are what they are.  G
186450,cranks bait,2008-04-13 13:02:00,721,"If you were in a tourney, I don't think it would count as you did not have the fish with the lure or in the net, thus no control of the fish.  That being said, who cares great story.  Deffinately a story for the grandkids.  Write the story beside the picture for all to read.  Heck you could even tell the story as you just caught it by hand.  Big Bad Lew the Great Muskie Catcher!!!!"
186452,Handlebarz,2008-04-13 13:04:00,3790,Yes you did and for a punishment I will accept the duty of collecting a day out fishing musky with ya Lew.  I guess its on the same level as do I take a pic of OOS fish nothing in the rules that I know of that say you can not hand catch them is there just like there is not rule that sais I can not take a pics of a OOS fish when releasing her?
186455,Rich,2008-04-13 13:15:00,3927,"If you did break the rules, who cares! Judging by those reflexes, you'd have the CO's gun out of his holster and pointed at him before he had a chance to ask for your license!"
186456,Gerritt,2008-04-13 13:17:00,6129,   HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!  Lew vs. Chuck Norris?  G
186461,Deano,2008-04-13 13:32:00,767,"Tarred and Feathered, yup, you should be tarred and feathered.  Great story Lew. Really that's all that matters, a great memory and experience.  Enjoy."
186467,Joey,2008-04-13 13:44:00,9122,"Great story Lew.  Kinda like my whitefish this year.  Before I knew it, my instincts just kicked in and my arm was down the fishing hole and I had the fish by the tail, hauled her out and was soaked and exhilirated at the same time.  I did actually call the MNR to find out if it was legal.  The MNR officer I talked to thought it was a great story too and said it was basically a fluke that I did it.  They are more worried about people grabbing spawning Salmon and Pickerel in the rivers he said, when they are vulnerable.  He had a good laugh and told me to have a nice day.  So, No, I don't think you broke the rules.  You are human and you are a fisherman and your instinct kicked in.  I'm pretty sure tho I won't be able to do that this week where we are going tho  Joey"
186481,Mike the Pike,2008-04-13 14:12:00,3421,Wow Lew what a great story I guess you don't have slimy hands.  Can you do that in Quinte too with the eyes.   When in need a man does not let that tail get away   Thanks for that Lew between those negative steelie reports and the motor bashing nice to see some real fish pics.  Ah April 26th can't come soon enough.  MTP
186484,brickNblock,2008-04-13 14:24:00,598,"Gerrit may be thee 'InternetHero' but, Lew, you an Joey are my fishing heroes for sure. As others stated..awesome story for the grandkids... It a story Ill be telling my immediate lads about.....they hunt the lunge too!"
186485,Gerritt,2008-04-13 14:30:00,6129,When did I get that title??  G
186486,Cory,2008-04-13 14:32:00,170,I thought you would have lipped it Lew.....
186488,JohnF,2008-04-13 14:37:00,3494, Wouldn't that be kinda like videotaping the speedometer as you head up Hwy 400 at 175 kph?  At least shut off the autodate feature on the camera.  JF
186498,lew,2008-04-13 14:55:00,12767,"Thanks for the laffs guys & gals  That's definetely a true story but I was just hoping to lighten the mood a little bit as things have been a tad testy around here lately.  We actually got 3 fish that night but that one was the most memorable.  And Mr. Eh, you already know the answer to your suggestion for punishment"
186501,LeXXington,2008-04-13 15:03:00,1928,Great story
186518,Tybo,2008-04-13 15:46:00,1373,  Jeez you got a short memory G  Quote by Gerritt:  Internet Hero eh?  w00t! Where is my cape??!!  To Infinity and Beyond!  G  Oh so Pretty Internet Hero
186520,irishfield,2008-04-13 16:07:00,26272, NO NO NO... Landlocked held that title last night.... Keep up Pete. !
186530,Gerritt,2008-04-13 16:45:00,6129,Hahahhaha!  G
186552,Maverick,2008-04-13 18:21:00,371,"Not sure what the rules are but what the CO's don't see won't hurt them. I caught a 4lb bass in a minnow net swimming after him with flippers and a snorkel   , I wonder what the rules are with catching fish by hand."
186555,Ben_Daniels,2008-04-13 18:34:00,435,I have no idea about the rules ...but awesome story! Lew's a Musky Ninja  -Ben
186570,SlowPoke,2008-04-13 19:17:00,2984,"  Chuck Norris wears ""Lew"" pyjamas."
186649,mepps,2008-04-13 22:21:00,1301,"Awesome story Lew.  I heard that Lews tears are Chuck Norris' kryptonite.  To bad Lew never cries.  I have the same thing happen witha big pike, Im not sure who was more surprised when I grabbed the fish, me or the pike.  I didnt even know there was such a rule, when I was 12 we used to grab suckers in small creeks with our bare hands all the time. "
186675,mattyk,2008-04-13 23:10:00,2110,"does sound like a pretty neat story. I have tried that before, but the fish got away."
186688,Casey123,2008-04-13 23:30:00,461," That is because you are not Lew, the fishing Ninja, I see movie rights all over this story."
186710,mistyriver1,2008-04-14 00:08:00,600,Not sure if ya broke any rules or not Lew but it's a great story.  Thanks for sharing.
