187519,irishfield,2008-04-15 13:20:00,26272,Satelitte shows the harbour clear of ice...but I have some doubts. Hopefully someone can confirm that lives close by.
187543,KyleM,2008-04-15 14:20:00,218,"Most of deep bay has little to no floating ice but theres a decent build up at the narrows into the sound. I think itll be another week before everythings off our back bay...  Wayne, I suspect the sound is good to go but just to be safe give crazy Tony a call at Divers nook......705-746-9757"
187620,irishfield,2008-04-15 17:10:00,26272,Ice breaker came into Midland yesterday and I've got a few days of work before I can play with the boat... so should be good by the time I can.  Mike... call the number Kyle supplied. He might think he's in Northern Alberta... but his heart lives in Deep Bay Parry Sound! LOL
