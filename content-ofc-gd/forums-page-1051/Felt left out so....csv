186809,huntervasili,2008-04-14 02:30:00,1604,"Well decided to head to the fly fishing show today before work and I was looking for a reel... after fitting 10 or so reels on my rod I found 2 that balanced nicely, the orvis Battenkill and a sage. The orvis was the better fit to my rod and the colour complimented it as did the weight as it was the lighter of the 7wt reels I could find. So a few bills later and here are the results...  Cant wait to get into some steel now... I definitely needed this stuff for out west and figured might as well spend the money and get the good stuff... Tight loops, Bill"
186814,Mike the Pike,2008-04-14 02:38:00,3421,Nice load of goodies Bill now I want to see some results young man
186819,Bernie,2008-04-14 02:50:00,3190,It sure looks good Bill. I have never tried a fly rod. Maybe a few lessons in May?
186865,Greencoachdog,2008-04-14 10:28:00,8163,"Oh Gawd!!!... now you're one of ""them"".  I can catch just as many or more fish with a spinning rod than with one of them flimsy Willer Tree branches!!!... can you get your money back???"
186877,ccmtcanada,2008-04-14 11:21:00,7971,LOL Glen....  Great stuff Bill!  Lookin forward to your reports with the new gear.

187115,Headhunter,2008-04-14 19:09:00,5703,"Sorry to break it to you Bill, but someone cut off the butt section on that rod! I have no idea how you could possibly use a rod with no butt section! How the heck do you get it to stay in the rod holder?! Looks very pretty Bill, yah, bring some up to Bernie's and we'll catch spotted eyes with those suckers! (or maybe just some suckers!LOL) HH"

187272,Ramble,2008-04-14 23:11:00,713,beauty of a reel....very easy on the eyes. What kinda rod is it on.  -R-
187414,huntervasili,2008-04-15 03:12:00,1604,"D&M regal, which I found out uses talon blanks... its a light rod and I went through nearly 8 or 10 reels trying to get one light enough to balance... But I got it and am ready to go... only a matter of time now..."
