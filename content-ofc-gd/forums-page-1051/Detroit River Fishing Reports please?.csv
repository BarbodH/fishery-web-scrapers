I saw a handful of boats out but couldn't see if they were landing anything.  I plan on going shore casting again tonight if the weather holds up, and I'll let you know.  As for a boat launch I have no idea,  I don't have a boat and haven't been in the area for very long."

The Michingan Walleye Tour stopped in on the river this past wknd and with the cold and winds the winners still managed 53# for 10 walleyes.  http://www.michiganwalleyetour.com/2008/index.html"
