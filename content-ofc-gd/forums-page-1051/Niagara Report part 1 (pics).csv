We've had some SMOKING days on the river, and a few where we struggled to boat fish! On a positive note, out of the past 26 days out only 4 were slow      We've boated some real hogs and shared some great laughs in the Boat! Classic running and gunning has been the key! Moving until you locate fish, then working the area hard!      Had Cliff and JWL out for a day, Check out the catch of the day        RC Car LOL!   Top Baits:  Roe; Hot pink both in clear and stain water. Clear water white, yellow, peach rainbow bags.  Minnows: Small!   K-wick fish: silver blue, skunk, gold, silver chart.  Streamer: white, white pink, white black back.   Smelt have just started to show up in the past four days. With this the lakers have turned back on in the glen! We boated some good ones!       View Part 2 for more.   See you on the river,  Paul Castellano Cast Adventures"
