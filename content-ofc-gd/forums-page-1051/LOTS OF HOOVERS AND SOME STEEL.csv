I got out thursday for a couple hours and got in to one of those 2lb cookie cutters...couldn't believe the fight it put up...Then I remembered that all the chrome in the last month were coming out of subzero temp's......can't wait for the ackrobats on the opener !!!"

187439,cplummer,2008-04-15 03:57:00,165,no the trout eat sucker spawn as well..   it's a steelie  revenge i guess  lol on the niagara when steel gets close to spawning this sucker spawn pattern turns them right on.... if it works... DO  IT        giver a try   you'll love the results..
187523,MJL,2008-04-15 13:29:00,2427,"Great job CC...They're small but they're still so beautiful.  Hopefully I'll be able to get out this week.  After 7months of not fishing, suckers don't seem all that bad."
