The fishin prices are: Full day (8 hours)- $1250 3/4 Day (6 hours)-$950 1/2 Day (4 hours)-$650  Now, if you want to see them topless out at sea it's another $100.00 an hour/girl. Not too sure what constitutes ""regular boating duties"" here, but I'm sure all the ""crew"" are highy trained....  Sorry ladies, there doesnt seem to be an option for you...  Wayne, think this would fly at Temagami? LOL!"
