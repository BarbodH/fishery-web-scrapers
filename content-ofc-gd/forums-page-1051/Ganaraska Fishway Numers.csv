Let me say that this board is great and full of really good and valuable info, I am or was a really avid fisherman but due to many different reasons my fishing has been dramatically reduced. After many years it looks like I will finally get a chance at a good Rainbow Opener but for the life of me I can not find the link for the Ganny numbers this year, any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!  Just a side note I live in the Vaughan area and would like to hook up with anybody to chase some chrome.  Thanks"
