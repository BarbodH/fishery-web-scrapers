186095,jjcanoe,2008-04-12 20:19:00,744,"Just wondering what colour preferences everyone has, and why you like them or is there a difference.  jjcanoe"
186100,lew,2008-04-12 20:34:00,12767,"I've been using grey H2Optics for a few years now and like the color, but the amber is nice on dull rainy days."
186101,Canuck2fan,2008-04-12 20:36:00,1444,"One colour won't cut it when it comes to your eyes.... My glasses came with three sets of lens the colours are amber, grey and vermillion. If you have intense sunshine you use the grey, lower level sun the amber and the vermillion stay in the case till I figure out what they are for LOL."
186105,kickingfrog,2008-04-12 20:45:00,8333,"I agree with the Fan above, two tints are very useful, if not necessary. Excuse me, I'm now going to find out exactly what colour vermilion is."
186113,kickingfrog,2008-04-12 20:53:00,8333,"Another note about sunglasses and being out on the water. It doesn't hurt to take a quick look at the sky every now and again without the glasses on. I've found that some of those sunglasses that ""brighten"" up or make things ""sharper"" tend to also disguise the light conditions or weather changes. You don't want to be far from home and realize that a storm has come up.  Vermilion is an orangeish red."

186338,jjcanoe,2008-04-13 03:11:00,744,"Grey and amber are apparently the 2 most common colours. I didn't realize that there are a lot of other shades of shades.  I've got a set of amber and also grey, the amber I keep in the truck for driving and the grey I use for fishing and driving my car.  jjcanoe"
186423,Mark Kulik,2008-04-13 11:16:00,348,"I use Solar Bat in Mossback green-this color was invented by an optician, and has a patent-great for sight fishing and work well in cloud and sun.-a lot of my fishing is done on Simcoe where visual is very important.  Mark -"
186430,jwoolley,2008-04-13 11:49:00,25,"I have amber and gray, I used the amber (Angler Eyes) on the open water in lake Ontario last season and they worked very well. If I didn't have them I would not have lasted vary long in the intense light that the sun was causing when bouncing back off of the haze."
186525,Silver Tracker,2008-04-13 16:27:00,12,Its simple- Hobie Sightmasters- Yellow- glass - not plastic- not a better sunglass made in my opinion.  Thats why half the pro's in the US wear them.
186696,Raf,2008-04-13 23:43:00,3495,what about the other half?
186732,jjcanoe,2008-04-14 00:35:00,744,400+ views and only 47 votes!?  I put the question out on another board and grey is the the pick over there so far.  Very interesting  jjcanoe

187016,kennyman,2008-04-14 16:26:00,737,"I don't have any specific ""fishing glasses"". I use the same ones I drive with. I think they're Foster Grants from Wallymart. Is that why I don't catch any fish? If not, it's a great excuse. I lose or wreck all mine anyway so I can't see paying a couple hundred bucks for glasses to sit on."
