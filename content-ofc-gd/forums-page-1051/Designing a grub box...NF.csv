Just curious to see others, as it may have a handy feature to include in my design. So far I know I want the front to open out to a work surface, will incorporate a plastic cutting board into it.  Will be using 1/4"" ply for most construction, I guess box joints on all edges would be the strongest way to go...backed up by 1x1 strips glued and nailed in the corners.  Searched for images etc on google, but not really too much came back for what I would find useful, since alot of them were pretty big and meant to be hauled in a truck etc.  All ideas welcomed!"
