186789,KyleM,2008-04-14 01:54:00,218,I have a feeling this board has maxed out on new ideas for threads.
186795,Rustic-Fisher,2008-04-14 02:05:00,826,"Yikes, remember its just a hobby dude!!!! Just like reading message boards about things we all enjoy doing! or want to learn more about. Deep breaths, . LOL...  RF"

186831,Moosebunk,2008-04-14 03:23:00,3970,"Anyone is welcome at my spots. Please pm me and I'll send you right to them. Be prepared to fish above the 51st.  Now, your turn to share."

186853,jonnybass,2008-04-14 05:00:00,346," Geeeze, you try to be helpful on this forum, and this is the crap you get!  Nice.  I've never seen such a GREEDY group of people like some of the people here.  Reading crap like this, you would think that there aren't enough fish in Ontario for everyone to catch their fair share!"
186854,camillj,2008-04-14 05:43:00,1988,"Not sure what all the bunk is about ... I still fish the Wilmot, and Oshawa, and Bowmanville and many of the other tribs mentioned ... ALONE ... most of the time because thats how I prefer to do it ... and if you want  you can too... you just have to be prepared to walk and know what you're looking for.   By the way I was at the Credit on Friday ... chocolate milk ... totally blown."
186855,Tdel,2008-04-14 06:04:00,393,"Usually I stay away from threads like these ones which lately, has been a lot.  OFC is reminding me of ""The Zoo"" when it was around.  All of this blocking of background, pm me and I will tell you, do as I do, don't give out any info, instigating, arguing, I'm right and your wrong kind of attitude isn't very friendly at all.  What has happened here!  Tom"
186864,Roy,2008-04-14 10:23:00,13728,"It's the same thing every year, Tom and while it's no fun at all, it at least tells us that softwater season is just around the corner. We really try to smooth it over but it isn't always very easy."

186871,OhioFisherman,2008-04-14 10:54:00,6623,Keep up the good work! Nothing like a healthy rant!  Steelhead? Kind of like artificial insemination. Real men chase pickeral?
186889,Spiel,2008-04-14 11:46:00,9065," ....I fish center pins, have for nearly 30 years. Had no idea I was a  ""centre pin elitist morons"".   Don't you mean ""sots"", I think it'd be more fitting."
186902,TOM C,2008-04-14 12:21:00,76,   Pickeral are like BIGFOOTeveryone has heard of them but never seen one   THEIR FREAKIN WALLEYE    lol
186915,fishinggeek,2008-04-14 13:08:00,325,  That really sucks and ruins things for a lot of us.  I don't even fish for stealhead but I enjoy reading the posts.  I don't think anyone here should be looking down on you and telling you how to post.
186918,Rich,2008-04-14 13:10:00,3927,freakin' steelheaders.. i tell ya.  12 creeks in an area with 2 million people and they think they can claim ownership over one.  When does musky open again?
186926,bigfish1965,2008-04-14 13:29:00,3382,"I think it is time to put this baby to bed. Let's just finish by saying the internet has good and bad influences on fishing.It helps people understand and is easily the single biggest influence on the cach and release and selective harvest culture we have mostly adapted. It is the best and fastest source of information. But that instant information does have it drawbacks. I know we'd all like to think our spot is 'our spot'. But face it, the more anglers there are the more people are buying licenses and fishing equipment and voting in elections. And we need that more than anything else. If you are the only one fishing a body of water and something happens to it, do you think anyone will care? But if many of us do, and someone pollutes or backfills or does something else damaging, the chorus of voices will get things fixed...usually anyway."
186695,Gerritt,2008-04-13 23:43:00,6129,"  Because the centre pin elitist morons would protest parliament hill threatening hunger strikes.... and the liberal idiots in the GTA would listen to their plight.. I like steelhead fishing... but these morons make it alot less appealing.. they prefer to fish and pose as if they were on the cover of a magazine.. where as I prefer to fish for fish..  As of late the mods of this site have been conscious of this.... and I applaud it...  Hence the reason you will not see a steelhead post from me... I learned my lesson two years ago from a member on this board..... since then not a friggen chance would I post a steelhead report.. it is just not worth it... Yet.. he posts about his exploits and you all love him for it... He knows who he is.....  so I choose to keep my adventures to myself because of this person and those that are like minded, of which there are many  I inform those that are like minded as me, and we share info via PM.. I might share the odd picture or two on the board though..  Overall though unless it is a group trip I tend to keep things to myself as I do not need the hassles from the year round steelheaders  I know that spot, your holding the fish wrong, why did you not edit out the background now millions will be there..... etc etc etc etc..  unfortunately many feel the same.. it never used to be like this..    I fish for fish...  others fish for internet steelhead forum glory.... enjoy it boys.  G"
186698,irishfield,2008-04-13 23:49:00,26272,"Hey... don't be wrappin us all up in ""you all"" !"
186746,PatrickGG,2008-04-14 00:55:00,562,"I would Trade off a Secret spot for another NOT! Bad start for a intro, we all know the fisherman codes and ethics here no need for stomping somebody for your personal reasons P.M the person or persons and deal with it."
186748,lunkerbasshunter,2008-04-14 00:56:00,2585,"ummm i kind of thought this site was about sharing reports, pics and experiences???  if you think you have a secret spot your pretty crazy. google earth pretty well opened up every body of water in the province to anyone."
186750,Casey123,2008-04-14 00:58:00,461,"mmmmmmmmmm....Google Earth, A great way to find new spots......secret spots...so we can post our GPS coirdinates here and ruin them for all future generations."
186762,kickingfrog,2008-04-14 01:13:00,8333,"I've got a spot so secret, the fish don't even know about it. Surprisingly enough there's no fishermen there either.  Isn't funny how all the fish seems to know where to go so that they end up where the fishermen are? How do they do that? They must be really smart."
186764,irishfield,2008-04-14 01:15:00,26272,I was just browsing around Google Earth as matter of fact. Noted how clear of passes they've made along the North shore of Lake Ontario. I can read the A/C unit model number off the Nuclear plant roof at Darlington! LOL Nice creek just west of it that's probably loaded with phish. A few more over from there.. Nice and clear on the Nottawasga coast line as well.... think I can see the fish in the ladder on the Beaver!  Now just wish they'd do some more passes for clarity where I really need them.. like my land up North so I can sever it on my computer in advance... before paying a surveyor to do it officially.
186768,Rizzo,2008-04-14 01:18:00,4754," that's your opinion.  For some people it may actually be about catching fish to feed your family...and if you can get that done sooner, you can get back and spend some time with said family."
186773,lunkerbasshunter,2008-04-14 01:24:00,2585," Fishermen not practicing catch and release ruin fishing spots not google earth, fishing shows, internet forums.  if all fishermen were like musky fishermen and practiced c&r more seriously could you imagine how strong the fishing would be in this province?  Which by the way already could be considered the fresh water fishing capital of the world.   just my 2 cents worth  Cheers!"
186585,brrutled,2008-04-13 20:33:00,3,"Hey there everyone, my name is Bryan and im rather new to this forum.  One thing i'd like to bring up is the fact that everyone here is far too trustworthy. The fact that you would let people in on little known secrets only to have them turn into streams that are just like, for instance, Bowmanville, or even the Wilmot creek. Rarely, if ever can you go to these creeks even on monday moornings and find less than four cars parked there. no doubt the cars of fisherman going on the advice of others. there are still a few creeks that are somewhat private, howvwer that is rapidly changing due to the posts of many. please, if you go exploring and find a killer spot good for you, but don't support the death of fishing and the now elusive ""secret spot"" because you want to be ""cool"" or popular on this site. this post may just go out to johnnybass, or it may not. Thank you all, Bryan"
186586,irishfield,2008-04-13 20:36:00,26272,Please spell his handle correctly and at least take out the H !  Been nice having you around Bryan...
186587,chickenhawk,2008-04-13 20:37:00,612,AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ATTA BOY BRYAN!!!!!! WHEW I CAN TELL THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE A BEAUTY!!!!!
186588,Dondorfish,2008-04-13 20:37:00,1000,What!!! - there's a creek at Wilmont and at Bowmanville??? - you don't say! - now I know where I'll be first chance I get!  Get Real - they are no secret!  Oh - and welcome to the board!   Don
186589,jughead,2008-04-13 20:41:00,92,I showed my secret spot to a girl in highschool and her Dad made her break up with me and threatened to punch me in the mouth. I don't recall seeing many cars but I was pretty scared and not really paying attention.
186590,chickenhawk,2008-04-13 20:41:00,612,he wasnt talking about bowmanville and wilmot actually he was using them as examples there cheif.....
186592,Casey123,2008-04-13 20:43:00,461,"I bet that before Johnny B opened his big mouth, no one ever fished either of these creeks, you probably had both of them all to yourself.  Get a life, you are probably not off to a real good start on the board.  Johnny, no offense, not sure if yourmouthis big or not  LOL, nor did I see any posts divulging the mother of all spots on ths board...but if you want you can PM them to me.   "
186593,jughead,2008-04-13 20:43:00,92,"You spelled ""chef"" wrong."
186595,Roy,2008-04-13 20:45:00,13728,I have a secret spot just loaded with Float guys.
186596,irishfield,2008-04-13 20:46:00,26272,He's not helping his guiding gig either jughead..
186599,irishfield,2008-04-13 20:47:00,26272,2 million people living on a postage stamp and they think there are secret spots and that nobody else fishes in the big smoke.
186600,brrutled,2008-04-13 20:49:00,3,"Now Now, not saying these spots are entirely secret, but atleast they aren't full of lazy sods who can't explore creeks for there own, and typically those creeks that are fished far less are WAY cleaner, when's the last time you saw the willy have no coffee cups and hook packadges sitting around on the bank? just a thought"
186603,Casey123,2008-04-13 20:52:00,461,"Probably should have had a thought before your first post singled out another member.  The idea of the board is to have fun, share advice etc., if it was that big of a concern you could have sent him a pm."
186606,irishfield,2008-04-13 20:55:00,26272," I see the current lot of pigs, from the same careless ancestors, are still fishing it I see. Garbage lined the streams back in '85 too (but of course I suspect you may have been in diapers or just a glint in your papas eye back then). That was about the last time I chased a fish species during their spawn. Funny how everything else is protected during same..."
186607,irishfield,2008-04-13 20:56:00,26272, I'm sure he thought...
186608,brrutled,2008-04-13 21:01:00,3,"No no, i thought this out well in advance of my posting. this post should be read by everyone who thinks that they need to seek the advice of others. fishing is about getting off of your butt, getting out there and exploring whilst having fun ejoying the beauty of the outdoors. it seems like everyone is just thinking about catching more and bigger fish, the bigger the better blah blah blah. all those hotshots who think they know it all need to be taken down a notch and taught to realize that it isn't the size or the numbers, its getting out and enjoying the sport. when it all comes to an end who cares if you caught a bigger fish, if you can't have fun doing it, for example pushing your way into a hole, then why do people that truly enjoy the outdoors even bother with it anymore? Have fun with your crowded creeks and declining populations of fish. you're no better than those who take more than theyre limit and come back again day after day."
186610,irishfield,2008-04-13 21:05:00,26272,"If you are concerned about declining populations... stop fishing for the things during their spawning run! I did so 23 years ago. And on the subject of declining numbers... I know at least one river ""lift"" that has triple the numbers of last year."
186611,danc,2008-04-13 21:06:00,4677, Not me. I like to catch less and smaller fish.
186612,Roy,2008-04-13 21:06:00,13728,Another float guy for my secret spot.
186613,Abberz,2008-04-13 21:07:00,140,"I don't have a whole lot of experience with trout fishing and now I know why....man I love my boat, deep weedbeds, and unmarked shoals."

186615,forrest,2008-04-13 21:10:00,1032,Secret spots?  From what I see board members go to great lengths to disguise the background of their pictures of caught fish.  Who the heck is going to go through a ton of hardwork and then specify the location of a structure they found in an open forum?   forrest
186616,danc,2008-04-13 21:11:00,4677," They do Wayne. Can you pm me a few spots where I can catch next to nothing and if I do happen to catch something, it will be small?"
186617,chickenhawk,2008-04-13 21:13:00,612, what did i have to do with this post? i jus thought it was hilarious and i understood what he was saying......man i am staying out of this before it gets any worse....
