187271,Billy Bob,2008-04-14 23:09:00,5865,"I can give you general info not because I don't want to share hotspots but rather because I don't stream fish anymore. You are speaking about stream fishing right, if not the lower Niagara River is the best for boat fishing and some shore fishing at Art Park and Devil's hole.  Now if you want to Lake Erie fish streams from shore or wading I would start from Eighteen Mile Creek in Derby, NY and then going west to Cattaraugus Creek that is in Silver Creek, NY and then finally Chautauqua Creek near Barcelona, NY. There are campgrounds in those areas. Here's a campground link for almost anywhere.  http://www.epgsoft.com/CampgroundMap/  Here's one of the top bait shops that is right by the Catt. Call Ricky Miller bait shop at 716-934-2477. Ricky can answer most of your questions and he's right on top of what's going on in the streams. Also here's a link for our weekly outdoor writer Will Elliott that updates every Thursday in the Buffalo News and also some info in the Sunday paper. http://www.buffalonews.com/sports/other/fi...ory/319825.html  I hope this helped.  Bob"

I ended up hooking more bass and carp then steelhead.  Maybe the same for Erie.  We did a trip last year beginning of april and there were tons of suckers in Elk.  Also, they recently released a ton of smolts on some of the stocked streams in PA so they will attacking your roe bags.   It seems a lot of PAers call it quits once the smolts are released. Maybe Ohio?  Never been but some say its better late spring.  They have the manistee strain."
