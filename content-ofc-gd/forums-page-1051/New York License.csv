Cheers  Ian"

187548,super dave,2008-04-15 14:34:00,323,Go to the nearest walmart on the US side and buy one.  Some walmarts are 24hrs but the vender that sells licenses sometimes does not open until 9-10am.  Learned that the hard way.
187558,The Urban Fisherman,2008-04-15 14:54:00,2050," Yepp, got mine at wal mart on my way to the lake in the morning!  Cheers, UF"

187577,Billy Bob,2008-04-15 15:34:00,5865,For faster service because sometimes Walmarts here don't have anyone in the Sporting Goods section you can obtain a license at any of Dick's Sporting Goods stores or any of our town halls.
187612,Gerry,2008-04-15 16:48:00,257,The on-line method only works for renewals.
187650,cranks bait,2008-04-15 18:28:00,721," I take it this means that the only way to get one is to physically waste a day to go to the States to get a lic.?  Guess I'll have to rethink doing the WFN Canadian Open in Kingston, as I cannot see me going to the other side for just a licence, which is required."
187733,walleyemen,2008-04-15 20:55:00,316,"I got mine a Dick's a few weeks back, pretty painless was very disappointed in Dick's though, not much at all for what i was looking for Gander wasn't much better and the prices were higher for some stuff than they are here, that's why they call it shopping."
187741,DANIMAL,2008-04-15 21:20:00,215,I do mine over the phone and get it in the mail in about 2-3 weeks.  1-866-933-2257
