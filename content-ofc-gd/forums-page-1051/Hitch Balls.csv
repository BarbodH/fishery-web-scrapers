186061,Radnine,2008-04-12 18:43:00,1538,"This is almost as bad as ""What hand do you crank with?"". But I am wondering if you lube the ball on your hitch? Dry metal to metal contact is almost never a good thing, no?"
186063,tinbanger,2008-04-12 18:46:00,1028,sure do .  axel grease when it looks dry   Yeah you right it does sound  TB
186065,irishfield,2008-04-12 18:55:00,26272,The only ones that don't are those that can't figure out how to get a good ground for their lights to work... lol
186066,Billy Bob,2008-04-12 18:58:00,5865,"Nope, I have never lubed my balls  Seriously, NO never. It would be really messing after awhile and have never seen a reason to start doing this however, I have heard of it."
186069,mbac31,2008-04-12 19:03:00,904,I always have. Keeps everything from rusting and makes for a nicer and quicker attachment. Grease keeps everything workin.
186092,Fisherman,2008-04-12 20:11:00,7201,"If you don't, you might be one of those that has his ball and nut slowly undo from metal to metal friction, then you'll have more of a problem that one messy ball, you might just end up with Andretti streaks in the skivvies."
186117,musky66,2008-04-12 20:58:00,273,"Yep, just a little. Keep a ball cover on it when not towing to keep it off of my hands, pant legs etc."
186271,Radnine,2008-04-13 01:47:00,1538,Thanks as always boys. Jim
186291,Greencoachdog,2008-04-13 02:20:00,8163,"No, but I've worn a shorn scrotum for the past decade... there's really nothing like it!!!"
186416,OhioFisherman,2008-04-13 10:51:00,6623,"They also sell stainless steel hitch balls, another option. I don`t grease the ball but the locking mechanism on the tongue of the trailer, it also will rust up preventing a good ground. White lithium spray on grease."
186534,irishfield,2008-04-13 17:01:00,26272,"You're not supposed to be using the trailer ball as a ground connection Paul.... Just wish someone would tell Shorelandr that. They failed to put a ground strap to the frame on my new trailers wiring. Guess when they switched to LED lights, which work just great, they didn't think to still ground the frame itself..... backing up electric brake dump valve just don't work without a negative wire !"
186535,Pigeontroller,2008-04-13 17:03:00,2793,"Oh, nevermind, I thought it was ""Itchy Balls, do you lube"""
186860,OhioFisherman,2008-04-14 08:15:00,6623,I know Wayne seems like a short cut a lot of the trailer mfgs use. My boat trailer and utility trailer both came from the factory with the ground wire from the trailer wiring harness attached to the trailer(cut from the plug).
186927,John,2008-04-14 13:30:00,2956," Yup that's what the lube is for Glen, stops the 'itch!"
