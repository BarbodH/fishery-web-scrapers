I know you are supposed to re spool but I was lazy, tested the line and it seemed fine. I used that reel and my buddy used his with the same lure and I out fished him two to one. I have been trying to find out what make of line this is so I guess the question here is who makes the best fluorescent green or yellow mono?"
