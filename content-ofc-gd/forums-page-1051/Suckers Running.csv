There are lots of creeks running all over the place and I'd like to do some fishing.  I am told that there are Speckled Trout in some but they are out of season for another couple weeks and by that time I wont be here any more.  There is a creek behind my house that I am told has runs of great big carp, though at first glace I dont see any fish in there at all.  I know in the summer I've never seen carp in there nor any large fish,  just small minnow types.   So my questions are:  What time of year is best to target suckers or carp as the case may be? What is the best bait, presentation and method to fish them? What characteristics define the type of stream suckers would run up or could be found in?  Thanks for any suggestions!   - James"

186672,forrest,2008-04-13 23:05:00,1032,"Suckers?  eeewwwww!!!!  I remember those things carpeting the river bed 2 deep.  use worms, corn or small spinners to catch those roaches of the water.  forrest"
186674,kingjames_2nd,2008-04-13 23:06:00,72,"Noooo!  ohhh... No!!!!  awww  man.      Thanks for clearing that up for me.  I didnt look close enough at the regs I guess.  bwaaaa.  I guess I have to drive it to zone 15 in which case I may as well get into some lakers , splakers or  brookies.   I`m still curious about the habits of the sucker fish though if any one still  wants to chime in with some amazing information!  Thanks again,   James"
186677,Ramble,2008-04-13 23:12:00,713,"I love sucker fishing....i usually use a jig with a gob of worm. The jig should have just enough weight to get it down thought the current. Then put the jig RIGHT infront of their face. Can't wait till exams are over to catch a few around home.  They are FAR from the ""roaches of the water""... i'm not sure where your home is, but there is probably a creek near your home with them.  Good Luck.  -R-"
186892,tinbanger,2008-04-14 11:57:00,1028,"look for some larger pools they are easy to spot ,and a jig head /worms are perfect. Not much of a science to it . we use ultralights for the fun .    TB"
187175,MuddyWater,2008-04-14 21:06:00,218,the eastern tribs of lake o are completely blasted with them. not a fan of catching those they dont fight and they smell really bad if you catch one give it a good smell. i dont know what smells more muskie or sucker lol
