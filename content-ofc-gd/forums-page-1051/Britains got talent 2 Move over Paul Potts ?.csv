186487,Mike the Pike,2008-04-13 14:35:00,3421,Hey Clive good to see you are back .  You are due to send us a Carp report with pics.  Was thinking of you the other day as I watched a Carp fishing tournament on WFN from the UK winner took 25 000 pounds.  What impressed me was all those rod extentions to reach the fish.  Hope to see some fish  pics soon if not send us some Golf pics  MTP

He nailed it, pure and true.  Our Charlotte did a similar thing a few years ago, I think.  Thanks for sharing that.  I loved the Paul Potts story too."
