Seriously, when a PM is recieved you can click on the members name and there'll be a pop-up and will clearly state 'Add to Friends List' I dont think you even have to have been sent a PM... Try clicking on any member and somewhere at the top by their name if you scroll close there'll be another pop-up and it'll say the same thing..'Add to Friends List'  Dont add me........ j/k Hope it was a help. bNb"
