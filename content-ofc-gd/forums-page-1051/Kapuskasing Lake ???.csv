Has anyone here ever fished Kapuskasing Lake (Chapleau Game Reserve) and if so what is it like ? I am planning a trip up there this summer to do a little fishin but I have no idea what it's like and what to take for lures. We are staying in a lodge just outside the town of Elsa. Any info would help me out alot. Thanks in advance 4x4

I would imagine that you are in for a real treat if you're on any of the lakes in that Game Reserve on the May long weekend.  If I remember to check my maps when I get home, I'll see if the lake you're talking about is anywhere near some of the other lakes I fished."
