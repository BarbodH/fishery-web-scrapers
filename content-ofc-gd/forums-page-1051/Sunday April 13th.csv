186807,live2fish,2008-04-14 02:28:00,70,Headed back out tonight after the seas calmed. Launched at around 4 and we were king bound. Got set up around 4:30 5 and shortly after we had our first fish in the boat. Little while later the rigger fires and im onto a nice on but the hooks pop out inches away from the net. A little lul now but we get one more good rip and end up loosing it after about 30 seconds. Back at her a couple nights threw the week and will update on the king situation.  tony with holding the only one landed   Bowen
