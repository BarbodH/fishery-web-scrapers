187535,FLEX ROD,2008-04-15 13:58:00,394,"Help please, I picked up a new 13' Raven on Saturday and I am curious how others pick the location for their fishing reel.  In the past I have always tried to find the center / balance point of the rod with the reel temporarily attached and that is my location, but the new Raven has a nice long handle so I was thinking that I would position the reel high enough so that the end of the handle is just at the end of my elbow.  All advice is greatly appreciated.  And a quick second question, what do you use to attach the reel, clear hockey tape or electrical tape?  Thanks,  FLEX"

187540,MJL,2008-04-15 14:13:00,2427,"For me, I normally line up the reel seat to have the butt end line up with my elbow.  I hate having long butt grips - I find they get caught up in my wading jacket when casting and trying to land fish.  I don't use sliding rings to attach my reels.  I prefer fixed reel seats.  My dad uses electrical tape on his sliding rings...He never had a problem."
187541,danbo,2008-04-15 14:13:00,2646,  Use the rings to hold the reel to the rod. Cut 2 pieces of bicycle inner-tube to cover the rings after. No tape! Leave lots of the rod butt out so you can tuck it under arm.

187545,wallyboss,2008-04-15 14:32:00,1095,I use self-amalgamating rubber tape on all my ice rods.  That tape has no sticky residue.  Main reason that I would not use electrical tape.
187547,MJL,2008-04-15 14:34:00,2427,"I think Danbo was referring to using the inner tube, you won't need to use tape.  I've got this cool shrink grip material I use for my carp rod butt grips and I would imagine it probably would work the same as Danbo's method - albeit a more permanent solution."
