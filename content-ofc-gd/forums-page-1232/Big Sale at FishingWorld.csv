61574,huey graphite,2007-04-18 12:49:00,362,"Thanks for posting this as well as the details in the Announcements. I did not see starting and ending dates for the sale and if the items listed were for the duration of the sale or on specific days.  Any idea?  (I know, I know why not just pick up the phone and call. That's the next step)"
