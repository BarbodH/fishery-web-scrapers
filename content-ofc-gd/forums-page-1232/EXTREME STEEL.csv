60936,canadian_copper,2007-04-16 23:20:00,925,a bud sent me a link from another board and it looks like some vhs signs!!!
60943,muskymatt,2007-04-16 23:28:00,2608,"I was doing some more checking and it seems up to now Salmonoids have not been affected( I could be wrong ) .But it looks an awful lot like VHS. Here is a link ,.,,I hope I'm not over stepping my rights by posting it. If I have ,I apologise  Matt  http://www.muskiescanada.ca/Articles/VHS_A..._Fact_Sheet.pdf"
60947,canadian_copper,2007-04-16 23:32:00,925,they almost closed all the fish ladders this yr cause of it!!! they say its been in the rivers for a few yrs now!!! trout definatly do have it!!
60973,ccmtcanada,2007-04-17 00:29:00,7971,Nice job out there Scott!  Winds and rain were a bit extreme today...it's great to see you landing 3!!!  That one is banged up pretty bad...and unfortunately it does look like VHS.
60977,Douger,2007-04-17 00:34:00,116,"great job, considering the wind (a float fisherman's worst nightmare?). -d-"
60988,Mike the Pike,2007-04-17 00:46:00,3421,WTG Scott.Thanks for the pics.MTP
61081,Minnow,2007-04-17 05:43:00,177,"The determination paid off, hats off for being on the creek with the 50 k winds! Just proves you can catch steel in any conditions!"
61086,solopaddler,2007-04-17 09:08:00,8605," Fairly common symptoms of stress in post spawn fish IMO. I've yet to see symptoms of VHS in Lake O, Michigan, Huron or Georgian Bay steelhead, but it's full blown in many of the fish from Erie's south shore, no doubt about that unfortunately.  Nice catch BTW!"
61092,canadian_copper,2007-04-17 10:28:00,925,HER OTHER SIDE HAD SOME ROTTING FLESH!!! REGARDLESS VHS IS HERE AND TX FOR THE COMMENTS FELLAS
61136,cheese,2007-04-17 14:17:00,27,"What should we do with a fish that we suspect has VHS? Releasing it does not seem like a good idea..... Thanks, BG"
61587,Fishmaster,2007-04-18 13:17:00,920,That fish has had the life sucked outa it by a Lampray ....that is not VHS ...no bulged eye's no red around the gills ...ive done my share of collecting info on VHS ....we have been shocking fish in the grand river for over a week now no sighs of VHS ...was at a meeting last night for the Daffsco Anglers Club  and John Copper from the MNR was there and all the live fish they have tested came back NIL of VHS ..not saying its not out there but is very slim ..like i said a Lampry has got the best of that nice trout ..not sure if you Trout guys no that if they ever ban bait because of VHS say good bye to your Roe ...
