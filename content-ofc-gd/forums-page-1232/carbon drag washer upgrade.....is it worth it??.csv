I followed suit and had mine done, and love it.  Big difference on the drag , especially when cranking it down for trolling.  I would recommend it , it was only 30$ for the switch. As for where to upgrade in the GTA I'm not sure but if you contact a Shimano dealer/repair shop you might be able to find out where.  Matt"

I ordered mine by telephone. Excellent service and economical. I haven't used them on the water yet, but the drags are significantly smoother, especially when cranked down tight. I used the Carbontex washers with a light coating of the grease Smoooooth Drag sells. Do a Google search and they'll come right up. Do a search for drag maintenance, Curado drag washer replacement, etc. There are a number of sites giving step by step instructions. Good luck, Andy"
