61854,taper,2007-04-18 23:12:00,611,I have 2 new diawa line counters that I need to spool up and am wondering what you guys would recommend. I will be using them to pull inline planer boards  and probably Dipsy divers.

61873,Mike the Pike,2007-04-18 23:43:00,3421,Before you make a line choice find out if the clips on your planer boards can clip on to braid if they don't you will have to make one full wrap around over the release clips or the braid will just keep slipping out.I have 2 types of boards the yellow off shore models which work OK  and work well with mono.I have a new board which is orange called the Church walleye board.This has now become my favorite.clip to the braid and will not slip.  I don't like my boards to release so I put the maximum tension and they stay on.Retrieving boards after they release is difficult.The other option would let the board slide down the line but the board ends up clunking the fish on the head.  I prefer snap weights over dipsy divers.Really simple to use.up to 3oz weights  here is a pick.I use 20lb mono on the yellow board or 10lb braid on the orange board.   I also use Diawa reels with the line counter.     Mike
61906,taper,2007-04-19 00:28:00,611,I use the Offshore boards with updated clips (OR18) and the tattle tale flag kits. These clips are supposed to work well with braid but I have not tried them yet  with braid. What are the advantages of braid for Dipsy use.
61917,Mike the Pike,2007-04-19 00:44:00,3421,Should be no problem taper.Smaller line diameter should get you down deep.MTP  Oh I have the flags on the offshores.I just didn't want to be flashy.
