60994,fishergirl72,2007-04-17 01:05:00,455,"Thank you very much BITEME!I want to personally thank you for all of your support and well wishes that you have shown me when my brother-in-law was recently in Afganhistan. For me the picture is hard for me to see but unfortunately, that is one of the downfalls of their job, but they left us by protecting our country and proud doing it. I will NEVER forget what OUR miltitary (past and present) have done for us and our country! ""LEST WE FORGET"" My heartfelt condolences go out to their family, friends and comrades."
61068,finfan,2007-04-17 04:01:00,44,For all who defend our right to live free and have died doing so. I would like to say thank you. There's no words to describe the pain they must all suffer everyday and how much I'm forever indebted to all of our soldiers for keeping us safe. God bless
