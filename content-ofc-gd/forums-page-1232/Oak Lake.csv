I just did a topo search and it found Oak Lakes in Peterborough, Algoma, Hastings, Parry Sound, Victoria, Kenora, Thunder Bay, and Nippissing.  Here's one site to purchase...not sure if it's the right Oak Lake though.....  http://www.maptown.com/canadiantopographical/52k.html"

He may also tell you a few hot spots to try. Good bass lake, and I hear good for walleye too, no luck for eyes when I fished there once last fall.  Good luck!"
