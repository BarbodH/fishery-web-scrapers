61692,Headhunter,2007-04-18 17:37:00,5703,I'd expect to use up on heck of alot of Ketchup! HH
61694,foggy,2007-04-18 17:39:00,38,"   oh nooo  lol ,,thats what i was afraid of"
61695,keram,2007-04-18 17:41:00,585,"I know nothing about Grand River, but if you are so desperate try A&P or Lablaws  P.S. My freezer is empty too"
61696,Patches,2007-04-18 17:43:00,48,"I've eaten my far share of silver bass and channel cats from the St. Clair river and they're quite eatable.  I've been told that if you soak sheephead fillets in brine over night, then boil them they are quite good."
61704,foggy,2007-04-18 18:07:00,38,"thanks for the replies, i'll have to try a silver bass sometime, and maybe even a sheepshead"
61726,Hellfish,2007-04-18 18:56:00,308,"I guess it would be worth to try it once, doubt i would ever try it but let us know how it goes."
61734,Beans,2007-04-18 19:15:00,3339,"Don't be too quick to pass over on those brown bullheads...They were a staple part of my diet during the summers of my youth...  I think they list them as ""Mountain Trout"" on the menus in some parts of the southern states...  A good soaking in heavily salted water (brine) overnite will get rid of any muddy taste...then rinse well...roll in a mixture of flour, cornmeal, salt and pepper and fry them up in hot lard....yummmm  Or do as I did and get the wife to pick up some battered haddock fillets at M & M Meats... (on sale for $9.99 this week)...LOL"
61738,Mike Pike,2007-04-18 19:21:00,1332,"Here's an idea, go fish the Grand but on your way home, drop by the the fresh fish counter at your grocery store and pick yourself up something.  You get your fishing in AND a fresh meal of fish."
61742,jil101ca,2007-04-18 19:36:00,41,bullhead and silver bass both fry up yummmmmy. I was just talking with mom about going after some bullheads soon.
61746,Joey,2007-04-18 19:41:00,9122," Wow, does that ever sound appetizing  Think I'll pass!!!  Joey"
61749,Roy,2007-04-18 19:43:00,13728,Anything that you have to soak in salt & water overnight is not fit for human consumption.
61752,Puckhead,2007-04-18 19:48:00,377,^ exactly
61754,Terry,2007-04-18 19:52:00,14456,"I'm with Beans on this one bullheads from simcoe are great tasting, I have not eatten them in years but we use to camp out on the shores of simcoe and cook up a mess of them each night"
61759,Puckhead,2007-04-18 20:00:00,377,"Well how come you don't see a bullhead in your neat little signature graffic thingy?  eh? eh?... yeah, that's what I thought:  'Cause they are nasty..."
61773,fishdawg,2007-04-18 20:36:00,912,"mmmmm frsh cats or bullheads from cool spring water - real good never had silver bass myself, have herd they are quite good as well"
61774,Terry,2007-04-18 20:39:00,14456,when I get a good picture I will add it to the signature...LOL
61776,Rich,2007-04-18 20:46:00,3927,Bullheads are awesome filleted and fried just like perch. Give it a try. It could be one of the tastiest fish I've ever eaten.  Silver bass are comparable to crappie or other bass as well. Best eaten fresh though.
61779,Patches,2007-04-18 20:52:00,48,Well you've convinced my to try the Bullheads with that perch comment.  I know a place to catch them by the barrel full.  Will report back on taste.
61780,foggy,2007-04-18 20:52:00,38,"sweet, thanks guys . looks like me and my dad will be trying out some bullheads and silver bass at the grand this weekend,,,if they're biting"
61787,ch312,2007-04-18 21:06:00,1590," to make a statement like that, you have obviously have never tried eating them. fyi, i know a bunch of people that prefer bullhead over trout. why not try it before telling people they taste bad? if you like other fish and have tried it and still dont like it, the fish was either raw, spoiled, or you cooked the guts instead of the flesh  yet another misinformed fisherman i guess. ah well, more for me and the others that know how great they taste"
61858,Greencoachdog,2007-04-18 23:16:00,8163,"Bullheads are delicious!!! Silver (White) Bass are a Temperate Bass and are better if the lateral line is filleted out when cleaning the fish, Sucker meat is white but boney... I've never tried one but would if given the chance. I will personally pass on the Sheepshead, tried it before and it was VERY stong tasting. I've never tried Carp but have heard some people rave about it, I think it's all in the way you prepare them."
61871,huntervasili,2007-04-18 23:37:00,1604,ooo how about gobies and mudpuppies
61934,oxcowboy,2007-04-19 01:06:00,544,"a 2or 3 lb sheephead isnt too bad, keep em fresh, and deep fry it.  i think it is very simialr to a bass.  i cant say i have ever ate a bullhead, but channel cats and flat heads are great with a cajun batter.  jason"
61979,Weeds,2007-04-19 02:11:00,782,"Anybody ever tried Burbot or Ling? Caught an episode of ""Ray Mears BushCraft"" on television the other night and he was catching them ice fishing. He claimed they made great eating."
