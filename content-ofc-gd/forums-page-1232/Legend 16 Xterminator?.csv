61283,davew3,2007-04-17 20:02:00,430,"I too looked at a package so I called Legend up north and spoke to a rep.  After upgrading the engine and other little items the price went up $5000.00 from the advertized price. Give them a call, who knows, you may work something out. I ended up buying a used Starcraft for half the price. Good luck"
61316,mdej,2007-04-17 21:09:00,98,I have no thoughts on the legend.  But I can tell you I love my Lowe and if I was to buy new my next boat would be a Lowe FM165 or FM175... or the Fish & Ski version.
61365,sonny,2007-04-17 22:30:00,511,"Last year i purchased the 16 xtreme legend,,,it came with a 40hp so upgraded to a 60hp 4stroke,,,couldn't be happier!!,,,handles well and fishes even better!!!!!"
61416,AzuluSpookd,2007-04-18 00:27:00,348,"Its all personal preference with the manufacturer...  I was in the market for almost a year...  I must have taken about 10 different trips to the barrie legend dealer...I was adimant that I was going to get a legend...because I truly thought the price was cheaper....  then...after adding the motor that I truly wanted and other options....I took all of the information and went to parry sound to Jack Burny marina.....told him what I wanted.....and asked what they could do....  Ended up going with the 1650 Sport Fish, with a 90 4 stroke (max) and a heavy duty trailor and all of the options that I wanted with the legend....I chose a non-current model (still has the same warranty and still new) and a non-current model motor (warranty started the day I bought it).....  The boat ended up being cheaper than the legend...and the legend only came with a 60 4 stroke....  I am very happy with my crestliner, but at the end of the day, it came down to the best deal for me.  Now...had legend given me a great deal....I would be in a legend at this moment."
61477,lookinforwalleye,2007-04-18 02:27:00,4399,Wise choice on the Crestliner I would think that Crestliner would have a better resale value than the Legend.
60864,pikehunter,2007-04-16 21:08:00,1659,"Another thought, before you make your final decision as to which is the best for you, check the fine print on the Legend brochure and with the dealer. Add it all up, every last little detail. Do the same with Lowe. You might find that they are a bit closer in price than what first appears. Legend has lots of extra charges added on at the bottom line. Everything from shipping to hooking up the motor.  Clarify the very, very bottom line on both boats, then compare the true price.  Best of luck."
60926,taper,2007-04-16 23:06:00,611,Check it out as pikehunter said and what ever you decide I would pay a little extra and go 4 stroke. If you want to troll and not buy a kicker.
60933,easton13th,2007-04-16 23:18:00,371,I did not experience any out of the ordinary prices..what you see is what you get on the Legend. If a dealer is charging extra shop around. The price in the catalogue was accurate to a T. Maybe I was just lucky BUT shop around.....
60937,lew,2007-04-16 23:23:00,12767," Check to be sure what the maximum horsepower recommendation is on those boats. Alot of times boats have what appears to be a very attractive pricetag, but in actual fact the boat is so grossly underpowered it couldn't get on plane even if there was only one person in it.  I've seen Legend boats with 50 HP motors advertised very cheap to the unsuspecting or inexperienced buyer, but when you read the fine print you find the boat is actually rated for up to 150 HP.........3 times the horsepower  that comes with the package.  It would hardly pull it self away from the dock.  Just be sure what your buying before you sign the dotted line."
60944,GbayGiant,2007-04-16 23:29:00,1780,"The only bad thing I hear about Legends is their sneaky advertisements. Remember they advertise the prices with the minimum HP, say the boat your looking at comes with a 50hp the max HP for that boat is probably like a 115hp, so you at least need something in the middle a 90hp, so that will be the difference there. Are they good boats ? I think so. Are they really cheaper ? Don't think so.  Sorry Lew, we must have been typing at the same time."
60996,JerseyDog,2007-04-17 01:09:00,190,"Remember as well, you can and should ALWAYS negotiate on a high ticket item like a car or boat.  I bet you can grind almost $1,500 off that Lowe package without too much trouble. Also, with something like a boat that you could possibly keep for 10-20 years, the extra few bucks now to get exactly what you want will pay huge dividends in the long run."
61040,pikehunter,2007-04-17 02:36:00,1659,"Check this page out from Legends website regarding motor upgrades. Legend Upgrade Options The boat you are looking at comes with a Merc 2 stroke 50ELPTO. The upgrades to larger motors or to 4 stroke are in the thousands.  And as for the ""hidden charges"" I was speaking of is mentioned right here, at the page bottom. Xterminator16 Note that the $ amount of the extra charges are not stated. Maybe in the actual paper brochure they are, at least they used to be, in real fine print in the back.  Get everything in detail, then compare. I'm not trying to critique Legend, just like some others said, we're only making you aware of how they market their product. Read all the fine print, just like the car ads in the paper, you know the ones advertising the great lease rates and the 0% financing and then you get out the magnifying glass to read the bottom line minuscule print!"
61051,steverowbotham,2007-04-17 03:03:00,1800," My legend has a 96"" beam and a 4 stroke engine.  in 4 years, have never had a problem that wasnt my fault (aka torn props)"
61130,duber,2007-04-17 14:06:00,220,"Wow thanks for all the input guys  The max hp on the Legend is 75 so I think the 50 hp 2stroke would be ok.I'm not sure of the max on the Lowe.The dealer I was talking to doesn't charge for set-up but there is frieght on the Legend and the Lowe.I'm kind of leaning towards the Lowe for a couple reasons.The 2"" wider beam,it comes with 3 seats so I only need to buy one more seat and the Lowe has a built in gas tank in the floor for added stability.As for as either boat being to small for the bay the boat I fish in the bay with now has a 55 inch beam so a 80 inch boat would seem like a small tugboat to me.The Lowe is a little heavier and wider so I may have to up the hp on it if that is the one I buy.I'm going to see if I can take both out for a spin before I buy as well.The Lowe is definently going to cost more money and that may be a huge factor for a guy with 3 daughters coming into their teen years  .Maybe I will have to finance it over 40 years  .  Thanks again, Wes"
61138,lew,2007-04-17 14:27:00,12767,"Duber, go back and read what you just posted and I think you'll see why the Lowe is the better choice for you to buy. I don't think there's any comparison between the 2 boats.  As for the motor, it'd be in your best interest to max out the horsepower if you can swing it. If it's rated for a 75 and only comes with a 50, your more than 30% underpowered and that makes a huge difference if your carrying 3-4 people plus all the gear.  Those 3 girls of yours are gonna want to go tubing behind that new boat too  The smaller the motor on a boat, the harder it has to work to do the same job. If you go with the maximum HP, it'll cost you a bit more, but it'll be working far less to move the boat and could infact even use less fuel to do the same job.  Just something to think about."
61141,duber,2007-04-17 14:48:00,220,Yah I think your right Lew the Lowe is the best boat.I'm not sure of were I can go with the motor but I am going to check it out.I will need a good motor if the girls want to go tubing cause those heavy wool ankle length swimsuits get heavy when wet   Wes
61142,lew,2007-04-17 14:52:00,12767," Yeah I know what your saying, I've got a daughter too"
61215,blaque,2007-04-17 17:24:00,2419,"  Thats priceless LOL!!! I dont have a daughter, but i have a neice that Im a father figure to. She's 11 and i figure by the time she hits her teens, she will hate me for being the overprotective bear that i am. lol"
