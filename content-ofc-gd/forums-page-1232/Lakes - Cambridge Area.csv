I've tried driving, but all the south-side lanes are private and the northside don't have any parking spaces.  Almost feel like I'm intruding by simply driving in...  And I so want to fish it!!!  "

If you got a non motorized boat use it the lake is really weedy and hold some nice size largies and be nice people that live on the lake they pay to maintain the lake and stock it also."
