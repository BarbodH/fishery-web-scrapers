Good Luck to whoevers fishing anything... CPR Catch Photo Release is all I do for them trout, letem live to be caught another year  Bill"
61348,canadian_copper,2007-04-17 22:02:00,925,I USUALLY DONT BOTHER WITH OPENER(CROWDS AND THE SLAUGHTER REALLY TURNS ME OFF IT). BUT I BELIEVE GOOD OLD VERNO HAS SOME PRIVATE LAND SO I MAY DROP A LINE OR 2  LOL  I KNOW OPENER IS A BIG DEAL FOR MOST (CAUSE WE ALL DONT GOT THE THE OPPS I GET TO FISH ) BUT LETS PUT A FEW BACK AND CLEAN UP OUR MESSES!!!
61350,majorlifts,2007-04-17 22:11:00,171,I have a sweet spot on the Ganaraska. Not a soul around cept me and the steelies. April 28th could not come any sooner.
61351,majorlifts,2007-04-17 22:12:00,171,"Oh yes, and it will be flies only, barbless black wooly buggers."
61362,fishindevil,2007-04-17 22:27:00,6254,Ive been fishing 2 creeks on private property for about 15yrs and always have a blast where i fish most of the big bows have already finished there business but there is always several to be had and lots of small trout 10-20inches and browns that are residents so i never take any of those and in the past few years the browns seem to be getiing bigger i like to think its because of catch & release..  .so im looking forward to a great day of trouting as usual...then on the sunday i will prob hit the kawarthas for some crappie action....cant wait ....cheers and good-luck
61363,huntervasili,2007-04-17 22:27:00,1604,I am a barbless fly guy too... and I always bring more off the river than what I bring on... I hate the litter and trout dont like them litter bugs either...
61367,majorlifts,2007-04-17 22:33:00,171,The place I go on the Gany is surprisingly clean. In fact last time I was there I traveled 1 km on the Gany and only found a pair of socks on shore. I guess some one fell in and forgot their socks haha. This was a week after the opener.
61370,spanky,2007-04-17 22:41:00,195,"no where, sadly the niagara region doesn't have much (read anything) in the way of trib fishing..."
61391,ketchenany,2007-04-17 23:23:00,3229,"I'm with CC one this one, started doing the river thing in '68 in the Collingwood area, but after a few years it became a ZOO and gave it up. Go out but please don't destroy the place and clean up after yourself. Good luck to all . . ."
61393,misfish,2007-04-17 23:47:00,29133,"Once again the time comes and it,s like christmas day to some. Back when I was hot and heavy into the rainbow opener,I would book the day before off and get all my row made up,yarn flies nicely trimed and make sure everything was in great working order. Reels full of new 8 pound mono,clear back then. Make up some sandwiches and enough water for the days outing. I use to fish the credit,all the well known spots back then. Streetsville was the hot spot,next was Eldorado Park. I even found a piece of farm land that I never seen a soul for 3 years til one day ,I came down the path to find a couple of guys with thier laterns and cooler. Oh was I ticked that day. Not even a foot step I seen there in the years I fished there.  Any ways,I found that the weeks after opening were the best. All the, got to get there and got to catch a bow guys,had had thier fill and the spots I fished were very open and the fish where plentiful.  You guys that put up with the shoulder to shoulder opening days will Im sure, come to realize the same as I and CC. Let the opening hounds have thier day,the next few weeks will be much more relaxing and enjoyable.  I have not fished an opener in many years. I cant stand the shoulder to shoulder guys up here and like I said,WHATS THE RUSH.  For you trouters that will be out there,have a great time and remember,it,s a fish,no need getting upset because some guy/gal dosent pull in thier line when you YELL FISH ON.  "
61396,huntervasili,2007-04-17 23:50:00,1604,"Yup... I dont do the ""shoulder to shoulder"" stuff... I will be on private property with 10 people fishing that day max..."
61397,bassmaster4,2007-04-17 23:54:00,801,im hitting a stocked pond LOL
61423,Heybud_e,2007-04-18 00:54:00,208,anyone fished the grand river Cayuga part? just curious as to what may be caught in there..
61424,The Urban Fisherman,2007-04-18 00:54:00,2050,"It's my first spring in this part of ontario, and first year steelheading so I've never seen the shoulder to shoulder opener before......not to excited about it though!  I imagine it's alot like the mouth of the credit when the salmon start moving in, in the fall....  This past weekend I fished the credit from about 5:30 a.m. until 7:30 I was alone....took a walk downstream for a couple hours, came back to the ""hole"" that I was fishing earlier and almost fell on my butt when I saw at least 10 people fishing the same drift......buuuuummmeeeeerrrrrr   Good luck to all, UF"
61426,huntervasili,2007-04-18 01:01:00,1604,"Cayuga is mainly warmwater species... bass, pike, panfish, maybe walleye... I fish upper grand-paris and further north for trout"
61432,Heybud_e,2007-04-18 01:08:00,208,"thanks BP, i ask because i drive right by it on my way into P Dover.. will have to stop and check it out some time..."
61437,huntervasili,2007-04-18 01:18:00,1604,"not a problem... I personally dont fish the lower river as my target species, trout, arent too often found down there..."
61439,Heybud_e,2007-04-18 01:23:00,208,i fish wherever there is water lol never really targeted a specific species..
61443,huntervasili,2007-04-18 01:29:00,1604,I fish em all but I target Rainbows and Browns on the Grand with my fly rod
61450,xrap,2007-04-18 01:45:00,683,Hey bud if your looking for a place on the grand for steel try Caledonia or York.
61512,kemper,2007-04-18 03:53:00,2232,"Ill be fishing a VERY well known trib, and I wont see a sole all day. Thats because theres a section with no road access for 4 km in either direction, and I hike right into the middle every opener.  Its great!"
61539,canadian_copper,2007-04-18 10:23:00,925,KEMPER DONT MIND THAT LITTLE BLACK BOX WITH THE FLASHING LIGHT IN YOUR BACKPACK!!! JUST MY GPS TRACKER  LOL
61549,ccmtcanada,2007-04-18 11:33:00,7971,Bly and I will be out there somewhere...I was shown a great spot this past weekend that no one knows about.  He's seen maybe 2 or 3 other guys fishing this spot on trout opener.  Cant wait!  They are calling for temps near 20c....that'll be awesome!
61557,mrdylan,2007-04-18 11:52:00,111,Anyone fished the Oshawa creek for these? I am thinking of giving it a Try but more in the North End anyone know if they reach that high? I know I have seen some dead by this park we used to take the kids to but I have never seen anyone fish there before.
61566,Marko,2007-04-18 12:28:00,854,Last year i went to Elora first day after the season openned and i was the only one fishing there. Rest of the people were busy bbquing and playing with their dogs
