61418,express168,2007-04-18 00:35:00,327,"Here is a birthday joke for you,  a newfie goes to the circus and see's a man that says ""step right up and have my elephant guess your age."" Well the newfie doesn't believe this for a minute and watches a little girl walk up and ask the elephant "" How old am I"" , the elephant stomps ten times with his foot, "" wow how did he know I was ten "" says the little girl. Next a little boy asks "" how old am I "" , the elephant stomps 5 times,  ""how did he know I was 5 ! "". Well the newfie still not convinced asks the elephant "" How old am I"", the elephant quickly lets off three consecutive farts! The newfie in an astonished voice says  ""Now how in the world did that elephant know that I was FARTY TREE years old!""  Happy birthday Misfish and hopefully many more to come."
