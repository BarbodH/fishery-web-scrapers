I didnt know crap back then, still dont. haha.  One time A mnr guy nailed me, I caught a fish south of the ladder in Bville creek. I caught it in the safe zone far away from the ladder in fact I was 20 yards from the boarder line. the unfortunate thing is I was fishing with light gear and this fish went 15 20 lbs it was huge, and it dragged me into the boarder and thats when the mnr guy first walked up.  I tried to explain but he wouldnt have it. He took my gear and gave me a fine with a court date. I gathered witnesses who saw what happened and they were nice enough to show on my court date. I was cleared and got my gear back a week later."
