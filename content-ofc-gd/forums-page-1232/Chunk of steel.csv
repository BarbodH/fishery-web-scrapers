61428,silverstreak,2007-04-18 01:04:00,146,"Thanks Boy's Marabou and Rabbit steelhead jigs will often out-perform roe presentations , infact I use them for 95 % of all my steelie fishing. I have used a wide range of colours and colour combo's with great success. I love trying colours which most others seem to ignore. One of those colours is brown and orange amongst many others. What I love most about jigs (other than how productive they are) is that I found a ""roe alternative""which means all my steelies live to spawn another day. Don't get me wrong..... nothing wrong with keeping a fish now and then if you are so inclined either. As for fishing these day's........the best is yet to come. "
