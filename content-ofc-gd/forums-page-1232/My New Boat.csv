60842,moosehead,2007-04-16 20:24:00,90,"Congrats Roger  Yes the new one has quite a bit deeper hull and sits nicely in the water, should be able to handle some bigger waves. Looking forward to Sunday and the opening toonie tourney, the new web site looks great."
60850,bpsbassman,2007-04-16 20:41:00,941,"Thanks Ken, It should be an interesting year.  Let's hope YOUR new boat can get you out of the bride's maid role and allow you to pick up ""Angler of the Year"" status.  I'll be right on your butt!! See you Sunday. How about pics of your new vessel??"

61154,Headhunter,2007-04-17 15:24:00,5703,Sweet ride Roger! That boat screams Quinte with that nice deep hull! No excuses this fall! HH
61159,Joey,2007-04-17 15:33:00,9122,Very nice Roger.  I'm jealous  Joey
61173,glen,2007-04-17 16:19:00,2641,That  boat would be perfect for me.  Nice ride. Congrats.
61250,moosehead,2007-04-17 18:49:00,90," I have had it out only once for a test drive, did not have the camara with me. I will have to take some pictures this Sunday and post a report, it is a 1998 Legend V151 Viper powered by a 40 merc 4 stroke."
61256,keram,2007-04-17 18:59:00,585,"Looks good Roger  I'm sure she will treat you well  P.S. I'm not sure, but if you still have two boats......   some 2x4 and duct tape + couple hrs of elbow grease = catamaran. With it you can troll from Florida to Spain"
61285,Spiel,2007-04-17 20:07:00,9065,"....Congratulations Roger that's a nice looking ride. I must admit though, I sure like that motor."
60479,bpsbassman,2007-04-16 02:06:00,941,"Some of you may remember that I bought a new Tracker Pro Guide 16V last December.  At that time the plan was to take the 60 from my '99 Tracker and just sell the old boat and trailer.  A few weeks ago I decided to go for broke (heavy on the broke) and added a 75 four stroke Merc to the deal.  The logic being that it would be easier to sell the old boat with a motor and I would be buying a boat AND motor with full warranty, plus I got a GREAT deal on the motor from my wonderful part time employer Bass Pro.  There is no way that I would have been able to afford this boat if it wasn't for the generous way that they treat their employees!  (shameless spam  ) I picked up the new boat 2 weeks ago and have sat frustrated with the rotten weather waiting for an opportunity for the maiden launch and also to get the old boat out to ensure everything was still working perfectly.  With a small window of opportunity on Saturday with calm winds and some brief sunshine (and still cool temps) I made a very tough decision to forego Musky Odessey and get both boats in the water.  Everything worked great on both boats Now I have to get the old boat (Hawg 3) prepped for sale and the new boat (Hawg 4) prepped for our first Toonie Tourney this coming Sunday.  Boy am I pumped!!  Yeehaa!!  The current owner of two boats.  The old boat has served me well in the 3 years I've had it.   The new one is significantly deeper and wider than the old one.   My retirement boat??????   Sorry I missed everyone at Musky Odeyssey, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. One week to go to hopefully get into some action."

You made a good move going with the new and bigger motor too and you should be really happy with that set-up.

60549,Rich Clemens,2007-04-16 10:15:00,3131,Nice Ride BPS.  My first boat was the Pro Angler V16.   Had it a couple years and moved up to the Targa V17 Deep-V.  I really like the stability and the extr room.  You're gonna enjoy that one and may the fishing gods smile upon you and your new ride.

60691,bpsbassman,2007-04-16 16:56:00,941,Thanks for all the kind comments folks.  This one is certainly my favourite.   I wonder if I bought a 17' Targa if I would look even younger  It would be good to see you out on Sunday Mark.  In fact everyone is welcome.  Just bring a Toonie and an attitude to have fun.
