60997,Beans,2007-04-17 01:10:00,3339,"Subject: Getting a passport  Dear Mr. Minister,  I'm in the process of renewing my passport, and still cannot believe this.  How is it that Radio Shack has my address and telephone number and knows that I bought a t.v. cable from them back in 1997,and yet, the Federal Government is still asking me where I was born and on what date.  For crying out loud, do you guys do this by hand? My birth date, you have on my social insurance card, is on all the income tax forms I've filed for the past 30 years, my health insurance card, my driver's license, on the last eight bloody passports I've had, on all those stupid customs declaration forms I've had to fill out before being allowed off the planes over the last 30 years, and all those insufferable census forms that are done at election times.  Would somebody please take note, once and for all, that my mother's name is Maryanne, my father's name is Robert and I'd be absolutely astounded if that ever changed between now and when I die!...DAMN! I apologize, Mr. Minister. I'm really pi--ed off this morning.  Between you an' me, I've had enough! You send the application to my house, then you ask me for my damn address. What is going on? You have a gang of Neanderthals workin' there!  Look at my damn picture. Do I look like Bin Laden? I don't want to dig up Yasser Arafat, for crying out loud. I just want to go and park my butt on a sandy beach.  And would someone please tell me, why would you give a sh-- whether I plan on visiting a farm in the next 15 days? If I ever got the urge to do something weird to a chicken or a goat, believe you me, I'd sure as hell not want to tell anyone!  Well, I have to go now, 'cause I have to go to the other end of the city and get another damn copy of my birth certificate, to the tune of $60! Would it be so complicated to have all the services in the same spot to assist in the issuance of a new passport the same day??  Nooooo, that'd be too easy and maybe make sense, You'd rather have us running all over the damn place like chickens with our heads cut off, then find some idiot to confirm that it's really me on the stupid picture - you know, the one where we're not allowed to smile?!  Hey, you know why we can't smile? We're BLOODY ticked off!  Signed - An Irate Canadian Citizen"

61002,GbayGiant,2007-04-17 01:36:00,1780,They'll be putting computer chips in babies at birth soon enough.
61005,Heybud_e,2007-04-17 01:40:00,208,"is that with, or without tracking capabilities.. because if its with tracking capabilities.. im for it,  everytime i turn my head it seems as though some child was abducted, or lost.... i know i wouldnt be able to cope with the fact my child was abducted or lost.. it would probably kill me.... Bud"
61007,GbayGiant,2007-04-17 01:48:00,1780,"You get tracking for 3 easy payments of only $20000, the money goes straight to the government for extra 100"" plasma TV's in their offices."
61014,Terry,2007-04-17 02:03:00,14456,why is it  We know exactly where one cow with Mad-cow-disease is located among the millions and millions of cows in Canada but we haven't got a clue as to where thousands of Illegal immigrants and Terrorists are located. Maybe we should put the Department of Agriculture in charge of immigration.
61017,Dondorfish,2007-04-17 02:08:00,1000,Maybe we should put the gps tracking chips in them!  Don
61023,Heybud_e,2007-04-17 02:13:00,208,welllll... could always put me in charge..  nice post GB lol plasma in office..
61031,holdfast,2007-04-17 02:22:00,1813,Hey you got to give our New Canadians that work for the government time to interpret our language to theirs.  We do have to meet government quotas to ensure that they are an equal opportunity employer
61093,Deano,2007-04-17 11:04:00,767,"yep, that's a Canadave rant, always told it like it is."
61100,mrdylan,2007-04-17 11:52:00,111,"Oh they have your name etc. We got a letter yesterday from Unemployment because we went to Florida last November (from donations for my sons Cancer) and now they want to take back my wifes EI for those 2 weeks because she wasn't available to work as she had stated. ALL of the money we spent down there was donations to my son and we never touched my pay or her EI once it went towards rent, life etc. I assure you we can not afford a trip to forida on our own.  Reason they found out was the customs declaration form, even states it in the letter.  We wrote a hand written response and if they persue it further we will be going to the media about it and also that we now get audited every single year when we do our taxes because we have so much medical expenses to claim. I totaly understand where they are coming from but given our situation or others for that matter and the reason for the trip they could cut some slack every now and again. You actually pay into EI not like welfare hence the name employment ""insurance"". I know people that have worked for years and never had to file a claim and then when they do they get the same crap in return. Even better is they are sitting on a massive surplus no doubt due to  like this."
