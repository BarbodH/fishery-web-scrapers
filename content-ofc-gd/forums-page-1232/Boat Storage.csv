I live in the city and have my boat stored in a storage facility near Rutherford and   hyw# 400. I have had it there for the last few years. Problem is they sold to new owners and the rent just doubled.  My son and I fish the waters of Simcoe, Couch, Bass Lake, and Sparrow.  We often camp out at Bass Lake for some weedend fun.  Any sugggestions on where I can store my boat. It would be nice to find a place near hyw #400 on our way up north.  Thanks in advance."

61670,misfish,2007-04-18 16:40:00,29133,Thats a good place. For 100 bucks you got a wind protected launch lots of parking for the year. And you dont have to go far to catch some decent fish.  Welcome. I fish the same waters. If a see the red rocket give a wave.
61681,JFR,2007-04-18 17:07:00,498,"If you do your fishing in Simcoe County, try Innisfil Self Storage on County Rd.4 (Hwy 11--Yonge St), just south of the Innisfil Beach Road. You have good access to Simcoe, Cook Bay, then a little north to Kempenfelt Bay, and hwy access to the rest of the lakes you have interest in.  The only trouble is getting 24hours/7 days access.  My buddy Tiny stored his boat at the same place on Weston Rd and Rutherford that you did. I think the new owners are just waiting for the developers.  Good Luck  John"
61688,motion,2007-04-18 17:18:00,403,I agree John. I used to pay 50.00/month just a few years ago. They now want 150.00/month for out-door storage. I have one month left before the rates sky-rocket. At that rate it makes we think about selling my boat.......but that aint going to happen!!!!
