Unbelievable money in that area as seen here by Shaq's Mommas house......rumour has it property taxes are the better part of $180K.      The fishing was a bit slow, with only a half dozen bass.  This little lady come off of Barry Larkin's dock.    The guide was running a 200 hp E-tec on a 20' Stratos and holy cow did that little baby fly.  Definately fun!"
61015,bpsbassman,2007-04-17 02:03:00,941,I'm jealous SS.  Maybe when I go down next year I will finally get into some FLorida Bass. Sounds like a great day on the water.

61386,pidge,2007-04-17 23:13:00,438,"sweet deal open water, and its warm. Could that house get any bloody bigger how was the weather by the way? how manys days fishing did you do? I just got done looking at the same thing,  but theres so many guides to choose from. How was yours?"
61440,silveradosheriff,2007-04-18 01:25:00,1025,"Hi Pidge, I just did one morning with Captain Tim Frey (http://www.bassfishingfl.com). He is a nice guy and knows the area very well.  One thing to watch is that most of guides like to use live bait, which is very productive - but not my favourite type of fishing. If you want to use artificials exclusively - be sure to specify that up front so that the guide doesn't get (and bill you for) shiners.  :-)"
