But the misty cloud cover and the smell of the soil thawing in the don valley is telling me otherwise. Winter apparently IS over and I just know those pike are playing sweet love songs in the harbour.  Regardless of the over-exposure of the urban fishing scene and the surplus of local anglers lately, i predict an insanely successful pike season!  Good luck and I'm sure I'll see some of you out there enjoying it too! C&R!   P.S. Snag, fiddle, sorry for my hermit-hood. I just didn't have the itch. But i'm starting to tingle a bit."

61372,majorlifts,2007-04-17 22:47:00,171,"Lucid is not a newbie, Im sure you already knew that, and pike unfortunately closed early this season for lake Ontario. I have been going down to the spit, and the Islands for 8 years now maybe longer, EHG would know, but I have not seen more than two people at one time fishing there. Overexposure? doubt it. Have no fear Lucid you will have plenty of room on shore. I also have a little tip for you. if you dont already know, when bass opens there is some nice 5 pounders there as well. Bob Izumi did a show there once, and Im not talking the carp one."
