60164,Fishmaster,2007-04-15 13:42:00,920,I think this is a awesome way of cleaning up our river banks and fishing spots ...what a great idea ....
61165,Fishmaster,2007-04-17 15:52:00,920,Bags are now in ..if your out this way stop in on your way out fishing ..Fishmaster
61347,finfan,2007-04-17 22:02:00,44,I've always picked up after myself and after others too! I'm very pleased to see that some have actually taken the bull by the horns and get people active in keeping our environment clean and clear of trash. Fantastic idea and you can bet that I will continue collecting trash every time I'm out fishing.
59646,Remo,2007-04-13 20:32:00,33,"Hey DMASSE, Thanks for your offer to help. I called the store and let them I would be by on Saturday probably before noon to drop off the bags. I will ask for you when I get there hopefully you will be in. Thanks again, Remo"
59656,huntervasili,2007-04-13 20:54:00,1604,"Yup... Conservation and this clean-up stuff gives us fishermen a good image and on top of that a nice clean river or creek to fish on... I know I will do my part as I always have tried to do, whether or not I pick up some of these cool littlbe bags"
59668,Heybud_e,2007-04-13 21:21:00,208,what cha reccon we do wiff al deese trash bags when their full??? i know i have a 2 bag limit... just curious...Bud
59676,Remo,2007-04-13 21:47:00,33,"Well  if where you fish if there aren't any public trash  cans about, I guess you have to make the call whether or not it will fit into your two bag limit at home. Sorry, I know its not a not a very good answer, its all I got though.  Remo"
