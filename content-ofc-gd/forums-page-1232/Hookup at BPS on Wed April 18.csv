60335,Corey,2007-04-15 21:40:00,355,"Hey ladies & gents...  A few of us from the Hamilton and area contingient of OFC are making a trip to BPS on Wednesday April 18. We plan to go after we are done working, so about 5:30 to 6PM ish.  So far we have Gerritt, Jen and myself in for the trip. If any of you would like to come and do some group shopping it would be more than a pleasure to meet you all.  As well, if you haven't read about Speedtroll and his son Chris, we are going to piece together some tackle and lures to go along with the incredible donations of others to make Chris's life a little bit better.  Corey"
60337,Jen,2007-04-15 21:45:00,833,"If anyone would like to come yet have no transportation, I am more than happy to pick you up along the way, I have room for three more!  Leaving Hamilton around 4:00pm.  Cheers,  Jen"
60339,Heybud_e,2007-04-15 21:46:00,208,"well, going wednesday might just be in the works, Tracker and myself are planning to get up there someday this week, as our schedules are pretty different it makes it hard to plan for a day, would be awesome to meet some of you folks, till further notice...  Bud"
60344,Roy,2007-04-15 21:49:00,13728,Can you pick me up around 4PM Jen?
60345,Corey,2007-04-15 21:49:00,355,"At this point I will be getting picked up by Jen from my work on the way there, but if enough people want to make a couple of carpools for the trip, I can fit myself and 4 people comfotably in my ""Soccer mom Corey minivan"".  If I am not mistaken Jen smokes in her truck, as do I smoke in my van, so as long as you don't burn any holes people are welcome to smoke in my mobile as well.  cd."
60346,Jen,2007-04-15 21:50:00,833,If you meet me at Corey's work sure Roy!

60366,Jen,2007-04-15 22:41:00,833,"It will be nice meeting you Tracker, Corey, and Gerritt!  Just want to clarify, what is a Newbie and how do you decide who that is in a group of OFC'ers?  LOL  Also, Corey made a great suggestion in a post here...  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=4089  He suggested we get together a box and send it off after we all meet up on Wednesday.  Cheers  Jen  p.s.  Gerritt , you have nothing to worry about, I won't be playing with a .410 and they don't sell 9mm amo at BPS.   lol"
