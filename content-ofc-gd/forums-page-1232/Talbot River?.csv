61265,Mattitude,2007-04-17 19:21:00,155,I was at the Talbot river on Sunday and the walleye have not come up the river yet.  I was wondering if anyone has heard anything in the past couple days.  Seems they are really late this year.
61286,crappieperchhunter,2007-04-17 20:07:00,2582,I will be up that way maybe Friday. I will check out the dam and let you know. BTW no perch in yet either....as of yesterday.
61479,Mattitude,2007-04-18 02:32:00,155,I ended up checking it out again and turns out they are there now.  Some nice big ones too if anyones interested.  I'll be getting some pics and posting them soon.
