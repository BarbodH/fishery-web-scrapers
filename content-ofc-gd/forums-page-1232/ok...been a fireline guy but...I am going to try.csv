61275,ssauvain,2007-04-17 19:40:00,77,some power pro. Is it basically like Fireline??? Also use it in tannin colored water...so what color should I use?????
61277,urbanangler1990,2007-04-17 19:45:00,933,"power pro is thin, and it casts smooth, havent tried fireline yet, and am told to go with power pro always, i got the new red phantom, disappears under 5, 10 feet, cus its the first color in the spectrum to fade underwater..."
61279,Raf,2007-04-17 19:46:00,3495,"you'll never go back to fireline  urbanangler, it's true that red is the first colour to fade under water.. fades to black.  the red line is nothing but a gimmick."
61280,xrap,2007-04-17 19:46:00,683,power pro is braided line. Best coulor is moss green
61543,hawg_hauler,2007-04-18 11:02:00,69,Power pro is extremely limp compared to Fireline and it might take some getting used to. The sensitivity factor will astonish you as you can feel everything with Power pro. I am not very fond of the stuff but I use it for the sensitivity factor alone.
61579,ssauvain,2007-04-18 13:01:00,77,Ok I am getting sold on using it. Now if I was to use the 6lb. fireline for my walleye fishing...what test should I use of power pro? I am thinking of my two spinning pflueger putting 20 lb. on and one of my pike rods 30 lb...does that sound about right???? Thanks for all the help folks.
61642,Raf,2007-04-18 15:21:00,3495,"sure does.  the idea with braided lines is to match the diameter of the line, not line stregth to whatever you are using (ie. 12lb Mono = 50lb PP)"
61741,kemper,2007-04-18 19:32:00,2232,"I use 40 lb PP on my heavy bass stick. You know how getting stuck in a stem of a lillypad is usually an  issue.... well with PP you can pull up the whole patch and then some. Seriously strong stuff, and the vision factor isnt really a problem especially when fishing cover."
