60968,GbayGiant,2007-04-17 00:17:00,1780,Well once again my buddy sent me these pics in a Email with no story    but WOW! imagine seeing this outside your door ?            
60970,Bernie,2007-04-17 00:23:00,3190,Not that I have ever seen one but it appears it's a young one. Still wouldnt want to see one at my door. I would on the other hand like to see one in the bush-at a distance.
60972,fishindevil,2007-04-17 00:27:00,6254,"Big cats look so amazing.  ..but man you wouldnt want to mess with one thats for sure,i wonder why the cat came so close seeing how they are very elusive,and are rarley seen.  ..thanks for sharing really cool pics...cheers"
60974,solopaddler,2007-04-17 00:29:00,8605,That's amazing!
60979,Northhunter,2007-04-17 00:36:00,214,That first pic is too cool.  Not that I'd feel that way if I walked into my kitchen to see that lookin' back at me!
60982,Joey,2007-04-17 00:37:00,9122,"Holy Crap, maybe the racoons aren't so bad.  I'd be afraid to go out in the backyard at night if I saw that on my deck that's for sure.  Great pics.  Thanks  Joey"
61019,easton13th,2007-04-17 02:09:00,371,I would have had an accident in my...well whatever. I would have been scared!
61022,Steelcat,2007-04-17 02:12:00,191,"What a beautiful kitty cat~!  I think my mouth would be like ""cat"" in the last picture WIDE open~!"
61024,Cookslav,2007-04-17 02:15:00,1457,"I' am guessing they feed it?  That is incredibly odd to have a big Cat come that close, let alone stick around for a close encounter with a camera? If they are not feeding it... I'd be very worried about the mind frame/mental health of that particular cat.  But either way those are some cool pics. Thanks for shareing."
61027,camillj,2007-04-17 02:19:00,1988,hmmmmmm.... great pics .. but .... reallly .... I am thinking ..... family pet
61028,nautifish,2007-04-17 02:20:00,1416, Yup i agree cookslave. Allthough it may be an awesome thing to see out ur very own back door i would have very many concerns. Especially if i had young children. They''re has actually been reported incidents in the states of mountain lions taking small children from there very own back yards.  I would be watching my outdoor surroundings very carefully. I AM NOT SURE HOW OLD THE CHILDREN ARE BUT IF I WAS TOO SEE THAT on my back door i would be calling someone to have the animal relocated back out to a more secluded erea away from humans.

61067,OhioFisherman,2007-04-17 03:59:00,6623,"Oh no! LOL not what I would like outside my door or in my county! Cats are cool! in a zoo!  Years ago a buddy and me didn`t have anything to do so we got a case of beer, took our b-b guns and drove to a deserted industrial section of the Cleveland shoreline. We had a few beers, shot the heck out of some beer cans, I turned around and sitting on the broken concrete rubble was an Ocelot watching us. Not real big as big cats go, but certainly something you wouldn`t expect to see roaming around Cleveland.  LOL my buddy want to use it for a target, I didn`t want to do anything to tick it off, we decided the inside of the car was a better place to be. Half drunks and pink elephants? a couple weeks later there was a story in the paper someone caught it."
61082,ch312,2007-04-17 06:19:00,1590,the good ole SSS saying comes to mind
61098,ccmtcanada,2007-04-17 11:48:00,7971,Snopes come through again...but a cat that big should be in a zoo...and not on my porch!!!
61308,mdej,2007-04-17 20:58:00,98,"Okay Rick, do you Snopes everything you read or just have a large memory bank of urban myths.  Regardless of the story, as some point someone did take the pictures (Dr.ZZZ) and even at they they were neat."
61309,bigfish1965,2007-04-17 21:02:00,3382,"I just remembered that one from a year or so ago. Still very cool pictures.  99% of stuff from email is urban myth and usually the harder the email attempts to add credence, the less it deserves."
61321,Dano,2007-04-17 21:16:00,719,I dont believe snopes either. Clearly its Steve French looking for a little chronic.
61339,ecxstriper,2007-04-17 21:46:00,343,Don't care if it is legend or not would love to have that cat hanging out around my house. Big predators are a rare sight and becoming rarer every year.
61378,bigfish1965,2007-04-17 23:00:00,3382,AH HA HA! Classic.
61448,bucktail,2007-04-18 01:43:00,1857,Watched one on the portage from Head to the the Hog. There closer then you think.
