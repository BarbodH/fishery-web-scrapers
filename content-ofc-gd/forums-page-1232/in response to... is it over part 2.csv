61926,lucid,2007-04-19 00:56:00,9,"in response to...  - Snag aka snog (??) aka master/professional chameleon of photographic impersonation:  Sorry about the newbness! You're right, no introduction or anything. That is over the the top newbness! But I really don't have any cool pictures or good stories to tell!! In reply to your PM... I'm game so long as we have those incredibly effective oars still?   - Dude (why has everyone changed their names! I'm lost and confused)  ""if you dont already know, when bass opens there is some nice 5 pounders there as well.""  You can walk right up and tickle them even. Ask Ricoh! And if you so happen to enter into that bass tournament out of O.P. I suggest you always throw a follow up when you're partner has one on. You'll get a 20+ lbs. bag within about 5 minutes. It's the leap frog technique. Ask Fidel! hehe   - Mako aka Aron aka crazy toronto harbour wave runner (you hit that wave on purpose, don't pretend like you didn't lol)  ""There is no pike in the harbour. Spread the word ""  I wouldn't know, I caught all mine smack in the middle of april down behind the mcdonald's on ontario street in st. catharines. no seriously!! (*evil grin*)  Now i'm going to have to post that pic of my first pike. It actually DID come from that spot. It was bait. I know. But I felt victorious!   - brickNblock  ""Tell FHR I still have that great map he made up of the islands.""  Actually I made that. But I sometimes wish I hadn't. It's like a key to the city (or the lighthouse). Power has it's price. Use it well   - LeXXington  ""you guys are almost-famous down there""  Almost? We spend most of our time waving and nodding and signing women's bras. You'd wonder how we actually make the time to fish.   - Fiddler (I'm not even gonna attempt to go through your aka's)  ""I've got a bottle of El Jimador with your name on it.""  As long as it doesn't say El Carpo. Miss you too buddy. Poker night coming up.   - Ricoh  DUDE. I thought you might've left on me! I'm really glad you're in town still, we have alot of winter hibernation to make up for. How's melrose? How are you? Call me man!   - Jigger  I want to come!!! I want to come!! hehe. The senko-musky day. I had a blast man. I definitely hope we manage some trips out this year. I'll give ya the tour of my area for some nice bass. I'll drop you my number in PM.   Cheers everybody. Sorry to compile everything in one big post. It makes me look way cooler though doesn't it?  I'll stop now *bows head in shame*  "
61972,snag,2007-04-19 02:01:00,1932,Ya ya  Just bring your game.  
61980,majorlifts,2007-04-19 02:12:00,171,"Ya I know, I used to be majorlifts on the old board, but I thought Dude would be easier for people to write when replying. Confusing I know. I  tried to figure out how to change it back to majorlifts but I couldnt, so I left it."
61983,majorlifts,2007-04-19 02:15:00,171,Ehg and I tried for some pike but there was still way too much ice and the season closed way to early for us to even have a chance to pretest the water depth and gear.
