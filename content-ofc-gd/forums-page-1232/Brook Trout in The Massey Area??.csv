61267,TJQ,2007-04-17 19:25:00,7806,Does anyone know of any lakes/streams in the Massey area that hold specks??
61270,brookieman,2007-04-17 19:33:00,68,I'm pretty sure the Aux Sauble river that crosses HWY 17 holds specks.  Don't believe that's too far from Massey
61296,solopaddler,2007-04-17 20:28:00,8605,"Yes indeed, the upper Aux Sable is very decent for specks. That would be the Massey area as well. If you or whoever you're inquiring for has no qualms about driving a little further I know some decent speck lakes north of Blind River. PM me if you want the info  cheers,  Mike"
