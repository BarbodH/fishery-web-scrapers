With the itch to fish me and my cousin went to the Narrows yesterday to fish for perch. I don't owe a boat, so most fishing I do is from the shore. Expecting not to catch anything just to heal the itch and wet some lines and that was case. No bite at all.  Anyways, I want to take my cousin for fishing again, he's quite new in Canada, and need some advice of where we can go to fish some crappies or perch or even some catfish from the shore. You can send me a message if you want to.  Thanks in advance!"
