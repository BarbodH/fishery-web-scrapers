61323,mdej,2007-04-17 21:17:00,98, Roy - Looks like your boat is trapped.  Now you have to wait for everyone else to get the heck out of your way in the morning   Man my boat would be out of place with that collection of equipment.
61328,douG,2007-04-17 21:26:00,2693,Somebody must have done some crazy photoshopping on that launch photo.  Where is the console on that Lund with the 75?
