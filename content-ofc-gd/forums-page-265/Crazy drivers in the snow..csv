825522,pidge,2013-12-20 23:03:00,438,"Just got back from a nice trip with the miss' to see the Bobby Orr hall of fame in Parry Sound (she's the Bruins fan....Big time) Just past the 400/11 split it was nasty this past Wedensday. Whiteouts where I had to drop the speed to 5km/hr and even less. The roads were a complete dogs breakfast. I shook my head at the heros trying to pass. I drive a 4x4 and know better than to try and pass some one with road conditions like what I seen the other day. A little but of me always wishes to see JoBlow in his Jetta or whatever off in a snow bank for pullin stunts like that. Unbelievable. I rember my driving instructor from way back telling the students if you drive from Toronto to Niagra it'll take X amount of time. If you do the same trip and speed you'll arrive 5 miniuts earlier. At what speed I forget, but the point was is it worth five miniuts? I've always held that thought in my head and just wanted to pass it along. I think it drives home the point. It's been a good way I thought of putting it in perspective. Slow down. you may like what you wouldnt see driving like a jackass. By the way no one out fishing on the lake that the hall of fame is surrounded by. Nice place. Safe driving all."
825525,aplumma,2013-12-20 23:25:00,6896,"A car driving 60 mph is going a mile a minute. A car driving 75 mph is going 1 1/4 miles a minute . If you maintain 15 mph over the speed limit for 60 minutes straight you have arrived at your destination 15 minutes faster. This is equal to 4 average red light signals, one stop at Timmy Hortons or 1/4 of the time it takes for the police officer to write you a ticket. Slow down it can save you or more importantly some other innocent persons life.    Art"
825534,pidge,2013-12-20 23:52:00,438,Much thanks Art for the math portion. You seem to get it.  Now to teach others lol. Safe drives tonight and this weekend fellas and ladies. It's not lookin good out there.
825553,fishing n autograph,2013-12-21 01:03:00,2540,How long does it take to write a ticket???
825609,vance,2013-12-21 02:21:00,719,The last time I was stopped(30yrs ago) the officer asked me if I was in a hurry and I said I was sort of (9mph over) it took him 35 minutes to tell me to slow down.Didnt get a ticket BUT the date was pissed at me for being late and it was a BAD start to the evening that ended worse...So how long was it ETERNITY  vance
825677,fishing n autograph,2013-12-21 11:49:00,2540,Lol that before computers and all the technology we have. To be honest I can generate 5 tickets in less than 5 minutes now and that with our new redundant system. The old e-ticketing program was way faster and I could literally stop a car and issue a ticket in less than 2 minutes
825778,aplumma,2013-12-21 22:00:00,6896,Much thanks Art for the math portion. You seem to get it.  Now to teach others lol. Safe drives tonight and this weekend fellas and ladies. It's not lookin good out there. I taught defensive driving for DMV for a few years for extra money back in the mid 80's. I wish it was mandatory for all drivers instead of just the ones that had 5 points or more on their license.   Art
825793,bigugli,2013-12-21 23:05:00,6138,"Back in the early 70's, the stepfather had me ride along in the cruiser while he ran speed traps. He could easily write a ticket every 5 minutes. Of course they were half filled out minus time, speed, and direction of travel. Yes Toronto had ticket quotas way back then. If a speeder came by while he was writing one ticket, I just had to yell out the cruiser window and Gord would flag the next fool over. I just wrote out the indicated speed for him."
824903,npt1,2013-12-18 00:38:00,220,"Hi All,  I was driving to the station to day in St. David's and could not believe the way motorists drive like it was a spring day. Saw 2 cars in the ditch after they took out the fence that separates QEW from service road. Another oncoming car began doing 360 s, lucky for me we were on a 2 lane road by this time. He spun around 3 times, went back into his own lane, went  into the ditch backwards and his headlights lit up the dark sky overhead. What is it with these idiots not slowing down for the road conditions???? No wonder we all pay such outrageous insurance rates!!!! How was your drive today????????? Npt1 "
824913,chris.brock,2013-12-18 01:17:00,4053,"I did a 20k motorcycle trip through the US and Canada (in warmer weather), the drivers in Southern ON are the worst, I don't know why this is, but I hear ya'"
824923,porkpie,2013-12-18 01:50:00,2521,"My drive was great heading down highway 6 for night shift, until dummy that was doing 40kph in the outside lane towing a trailer decided that he would suddenly veer into my lane while I was trying to pass him at a very reasonable for conditions 70kph after having driven behind him for 10 minutes.  Fortunately I was able to easily avoid him.  Not all accidents are caused by excess speed.  Some are caused by people's paralysis and inability to drive in poor conditions.  If this is how you drive when the roads get bad, then stay home!"
824927,vance,2013-12-18 02:02:00,719,"You have to remember that we have been conditioned to believe that if we put winter tires on our car AND have 4 wheel drive and have traction control we can drive as FAST as we want.Yeah right,I haven't been in the ditch since 1964 and I was in a winter car rally in Quebec!!!!!! Went from Oshawa to Richmond Hill on saturday and could not believe the idiots out there.  vance"

824937,Fisherman,2013-12-18 02:22:00,7201,"What you see when you don't have a videocam.  Putting along at work tonight on the snowmobile alongside the fenceline, I see a car coming in the distance, kinda weavingn a bit, I stop.  As the car gets closer, I can see the head of the driver is down, (texting shall we guess), and it keeps coming and coming into the curve and then PLOOF into the snowbank.  Even during the PLOOF into the snowbank, she didn't break her fixation from the phone or ipad ipod whatever the jeeze she was cranking on.  Window rolls down, I ask are you okay, oh like yaaa.  You have a phone I ask and up pops the hand with the phone.....dizzy, dizzy, dizzy. Another 50 feet and she would have kissed a major hydro pole and I be stuck doing F/A and having to write a report."
824948,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-18 02:52:00,8243,"It can sure be scary out there. Not always younger drivers but it came to my attention this past bit of weather that many kids here in southern On have never driven in these conditions as we really haven't had snow to speak of for years.  One kid told me they wouldn't put speedometers on cars that read 220KPH if the car can't go that fast. I know it will never happen but road tests should also be done on snow and ice, especially in northern North America. Testing should be done on a road for those over 80, not just a written test.  Drivers here are no better or worse than other provinces or states, now Europe is different. Want a thrill drive in Europe. In Italy you pull the sideview mirrors in while negotiating mountain roads, so you don't lose one when you hit the other guys mirror, then if you beep the horn before taking a curve at 140 you have the right of way!!!  Driving in the Middle East and India is absolute insanity. Lines painted on roads are a suggestion only, turn signal levers are to hang a hat on, the turn signal lights are smashed anyway.  The best drivers ever are in Finland. Worse India."

824951,irishfield,2013-12-18 03:00:00,26272,From watching drivers education cars.. .. they go right along with expecting teachers (no disrespect) to teach your kids all of life's little mysteries! Sorry but that's your job!  First thing I taught my kids... slow before the corner.. foot totally OFF the brake before the turn.. and if that doesn't work.. that's what the gas pedal is for! Three kids and they have never been in the ditch and we have a notorious S turn that claims hundreds every winter on the way to our place.  Part 2.. NEVER sit at a stop sign when someone puts their right signal light on..... because they didn't have me train them on winter driving skills. They're gonna smack right into your drivers door. Get moving...and now! That one has paid off many times thank god!
824952,bigugli,2013-12-18 03:00:00,6138,"I'm getting very good at spotting the accidents looking for a place to happen. Must have been a good dozen in the ditches lining the QEW from Grimsby to St Kitts Sunday morning, and a few more this morning. The ones doing 140k when they hit the grease patch. The guys riding the brakes in the snow. Braking while changing lanes on the highway. Especially love the fools playing chicken with a loaded rig."
824959,woodenboater,2013-12-18 03:18:00,2277,"After China, Alberta had the most insane drivers I've ever seen (Italians are just fast). Driving from Edmonton to Calgary on Hwy 2 one winter was eye opening. Super slick roads with glare all over, (cars in ditches EVERYWHERE) and people are bombing along at 120+. I thought I had a heavy foot but in these conditions I was blown away by the other drivers. Just shook my head and watched the parade as I continued on."
824960,irishfield,2013-12-18 03:21:00,26272,I've never been in the ditch unless I wanted to be there... now that's where 4 wheel drive shines when the brake is not an option!
