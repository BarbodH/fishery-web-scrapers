825117,Handlebarz,2013-12-18 22:41:00,3790,"Well it was a great year for myself and people on my boat here are a few of the fish caught this year. I boated 8 over 50"" this year myself with a 54"" New PB that came on a double header with Ron and a great 52"" for him that was a blast and will not be forgotten any time soon.  My wife caught a new PB casting musky 49.25"" her biggest is a 50"" trolling.  Lots of big fish in the boat with many 46""-49""  I only managed to get out 24 days this year well that is the amount of logs I have for fishing I might have missed a couple days. I did miss all the great fall fishing with only hitting the water 4 times since the end of September. I cant wait for June 7th 2014  All our fish were caught casting there might be one or two caught trolling but we only trolled a few hours all season long. Like I was saying I did not get my fall fishing in so my trolling time was way down.                                                   "
