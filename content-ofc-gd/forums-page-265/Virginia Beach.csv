Neither one managed to be a steady paycheck although they were fun as heck. Now I work in the trucking industry even though that was never a life goal but guess what I 'm rocketing up the ladder in it because there is such a shortage in the industry. Banking the money for fishing,only work a four day week(35hrs but paid for 40)Try to tell the younger generation its a lucrative field to get into and will only get better but they all expect 6 figure salaries right out of school. Never going to happen.As for sharing spots on the iinternet it's going to happen. Anyone who knows how to filter searches can mine out some info. The reason for all the no parkingno access on Simcoe is the gentrification of the land. The rich buy up all the waterfront property and don't want the unwashed sharing their paradise and they hold sway with city councils and zoning committees."

That's an easy answer, you aren't advertising it to kids. I belong to a few clubs as well but only one of them has another youth member. Do you think these clubs ever had kids involved? Probably not, I can tell you there are lots of kids out there who love to fish but a club isn't always the most inviting setting for them (I just so happen to like sitting around the conservation meetings, I'm weird )."

Simcoe is everybody's lake, just because you spent 80 years fishing it doesn't mean you have anymore rights than a newbie fishing it for the first time, after doing some quick research on the web. Like seriously are you that threatened that more and more people are fishing the lake? IT'S NOT YOURS - fish, have fun, and go home happy, you'll live longer.  Some of you are missing the big picture here. While Simcoe has always been a very popular place, why is it that so many no parking signs and complaints from residents have come about in just the last few years? Why is it that the very spot the OP was referring too (VB) allowed parking on the road ""forever"" and just in the last couple years parking on the road has resulted in parking tickets?  Spot specific internet reports, that's why    Also, the daily ice and fishing reports from a select few are posted simply because it benefits themselves through bait sales, hut rentals, or guiding services."

Even the ""educated"" middle class are being slowly pushed down the economic wealth ladder. I agree that many people feel entitled nowadays. We all are free to choose our own destiny in this country, provided we have the necessary work ethic and skills. However, times will be tougher for our children. I encourage my children to work hard and jump through the right hoops so that they can choose a career that is rewarding in their future.

To be honest, it's benefited me as well though, as back in the day I had to guestimate from experience just how many days after a rain that I could fish a river etc.  and you got pretty good at it after a while, but there was the odd busted trip because it had rained harder, or there was more runoff than you thought.

You see the politicians will be reelected not by fishermen, but by the locals that live beside the lake.

825341,lovetofish,2013-12-20 01:04:00,500,"I may not have put 25 years in, but I have put the last 8 years in. Fishing almost every weekend, sometimes twice a weekend. Dragging my portable around by hand. And I have learned things from this message board. If your against the internet and sharing of information, why are you on a message board in the first place?"
825344,jbailey,2013-12-20 01:09:00,866,Not too mention that influx over 25 years could be a result of the ridiculous population growth of southern Ontario
825347,Richie Razor,2013-12-20 01:21:00,536,"Man, some of you guys really need to get out more.  Simcoe is everybody's lake, just because you spent 80 years fishing it doesn't mean you have anymore rights than a newbie fishing it for the first time, after doing some quick research on the web. Like seriously are you that threatened that more and more people are fishing the lake? IT'S NOT YOURS - fish, have fun, and go home happy, you'll live longer."
825349,gaspumper,2013-12-20 01:34:00,393,Some people  think it's there lake and the rest of you stay to hell off it.
825350,Sinker,2013-12-20 01:39:00,8692,"Hahaha.....you guys kill me. of course its not my lake, and I dont mind fishing with people either, all im saying id if we keep this info open to anyone, the lake wont take the pressure. Go fish, have fun, share with your friends and family, just keep it off the internet....simple!  Im not saying I own the lake and I dont want anyone else on it, just that the ease of access to information these days is doing damage to the lakes and fish populations.  You guys need to lighten up, not me...think about it! If you like to fish lake simecoe (or any other lake) dont tell the whole world about it, or the next time you go, you wont have a spot to fish.  Pretty straight forward if you ask me....  S."
825353,Sinker,2013-12-20 01:44:00,8692,"Your totally missing my point.  I share lots of info, and help TONS of people, just not on a public forum.  Everything here is just a google search away, you dont even have to be a member. Any poacher, garbage dumper, theif etc can obtain this info, anytime, and the click of a mouse.  I have no problem sharing info, just not on a public forum. I actually come here for the non-fishing posts, and ive learned TONS of stuff from this site.  Keep your spots tight lipped, trust me, you'll thank me later!  S."
825355,Christopheraaron,2013-12-20 01:48:00,3525,"Have to say I agree with S, there is a lot of info posted out there that shouldn't be. That said I don't think that it is wrong for people to post reports that could keep people safer than they would be otherwise."
825359,Acountdeleted,2013-12-20 02:07:00,2562,"The thing is though, the internet is a great resource to get out and learn 'HOW' to ice fish. I have been fishing for almost 25 years now but I only got into ice fishing a few years ago. Before then I had rented huts on Scugog and Guelph lake and I didn't really have much fun. Joining this message board, getting some info on the gear I needed and learning about ""Safe ice' were all key to getting me interested in ice fishing and have been keeping me safe. If it wasn't for this forum and some helpful members I would probably be going out this winter on 3 inches of ice in shorts and a t-shirt (ok maybe not that crazy, but you get the idea).  This forum told me about Simcoe and where to catch piles and piles of perch and it was great and it was a start.  I dunno, I feel like without sharing information and things like 'the blue ice report' there would be a lot more people going through the ice, probably me included."

825364,lovetofish,2013-12-20 02:35:00,500,It was a youtube video. You would find it there via a google search
825374,BillM,2013-12-20 03:04:00,17367,"Do people think Simcoe wasn't busy 25 years ago?  I remember fishing out of Lefroy with the old man when I was a little kid, it was like a city out on the ice.  Hundreds of cars, huts, peopl walking, etc...   all over the place."
824889,lovetofish,2013-12-17 23:45:00,500,"Anyone know how much ice there is at Virginia Beach? I know there is 4"" at Gilford Road in Cook's bay. Getting the ich to get out there.  Thanks in advance  LTF"
824915,Cosmos,2013-12-18 01:21:00,588,4-5 inches. I am planning to go and check it tomorrow.
824916,Luke V.,2013-12-18 01:27:00,286,There is 5 solid inches of black ice from the reports I read this afternoon
824930,lovetofish,2013-12-18 02:08:00,500,Someone sent me a cool video
824932,lovetofish,2013-12-18 02:10:00,500,No more video
825022,Sinker,2013-12-18 15:48:00,8692,"These guys doing the video reports of ice conditions are going to wreck the lake. I've been fishing port bolster side for many, many years, and there was never a problem finding a spot to park. Last year, this guy was posting videos from this side, and I couldn't even find a parking spot. Not to mention all the garbage, and crap lying around.  Local residents aren't going to put up with the crowds he's drawing over there for very long, then we'll all be screwed for a place to go.  Why can't people just keep they're yaps shut?? I guess they like the pat on the back?? I don't get it.  S."

I guess they like the pat on the back?? I don't get it.  S. I agree. The last 2-3 winters Port Bolster has seen more winter fishing pressure then the previous 10 winters combined IMHO. I get there early well before sun up and still have several people beat me there. That never used to happen.  John is a good guy and I believe he is only trying to be helpful and promote fishing. However as you mentioned the hordes are never respectful and eventually if the locals get fed up we will all lose more access points."
825031,Renegade67,2013-12-18 16:21:00,86,Yup that ice report was bitter sweet....  Nice to know but it does ring the dinner bell for many.    They say theres millions of perch in Simcoe.... lets hope that report is true!
825060,Sinker,2013-12-18 18:07:00,8692,"Ya, there used to be millions of whities too.....we all know where they went!!!  S."

825087,Cosmos,2013-12-18 19:50:00,588,"Came back.  Started at 7 am, saw only one guy on ice. More people came later. Ice is good 4-5 inches and it's black. Fishing was quite slow. We started at 9 fow and moved numerous times. Caught about a dozen of decent size perch with biggest ones 13 and 12 inches. Left around 1 pm. It's a lot of snow on ice so moving around it's quite difficult. Saw some people on atv's. There's a road from shore to island."
825094,ketchenany,2013-12-18 20:40:00,3229,You told them?
825096,landry,2013-12-18 21:16:00,1005,"I think Johns reports are fine. He is not saying where they r biting. He is a good guy. One of the main reasons that shore has been busy is due to poor ice conditions, at least two years ago anyways, that kept people off whitey and laker spots. And the perching is good along that shore too."
825097,limeyangler,2013-12-18 21:18:00,5204,i liked the flyover ... Me too…i want a drone for my GoPro this xmas.
825105,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-18 21:57:00,4399,there are still ice fishermen out there that don`t know about Simcoe...  I guess Mr.Wyhte does not subscribe to the it`s my lake you stay away theory!!!
825132,GbayGiant,2013-12-18 23:26:00,1780,There always has to be a Hero.  
825152,BillM,2013-12-19 00:39:00,17367,"You told them?  I wish I was in the 'know', I think I landed one whitie last year, lol!   Lakers on the other hand last year were off the hook!"
825189,Sinker,2013-12-19 03:48:00,8692,"Whats wrong with people actually getting off their couch and checking for themselves? If you dont think these internet reports, and now videos, add to the crowds, im sorry, but your dead wrong!  S."
825194,johnl,2013-12-19 04:55:00,197,"I'm not trying to be rude but isn't lake simcoe the most ice fished lake in north America?i';m sure these videos don't help but anyone who has seen the weather forecast knows its been making ice. Tell the people you see litter or keep more than their limits that they are in the wrong instead of complaining on the internet .p,.s. I've only fished simcoe maybe10 times when I was a kid but plan to ice fish it in the future just my 2 cents"
825195,lovetofish,2013-12-19 05:06:00,500,"Just so you know I posted the viseo because I found it interesting and thought other people might like it too. My hut goes out at Virginia Beach, so if I was ruining anything for anyone then i was ruining it for myself too! The crowds at Simcoe will always be growing and it will always piss off local residence. I'm sure this viseo isn't going to wreck the perch population or magically put garbage all over the ice. It is and always has been the responsibility of the fisherman to clean up after themselves. If i have drawn to big of a crowd to Virginia Beach, then I am sorry. Guess I get excited right before the ice fishing season starts"
825196,Acountdeleted,2013-12-19 05:49:00,2562,"I like Simcoe but I know if I go there its going to be busy. That being said, there are lots of good lakes that are just a little further of a drive away from there. I know that if I want peace and quiet its worth it to make a bit more of a trip."

I will agree with the junk and the mess people make. There is no excuse for that and it really bothers me when I see all that nonsense on the launch or ice."
825198,gotfish,2013-12-19 07:02:00,53,John's vidios are about safety. I appreciate every one of them. if you dont like the crouds then you best be going out on weekdays or another lake. Being so close to the largest city in Canada what would you expect. Thanks for the vidio.
