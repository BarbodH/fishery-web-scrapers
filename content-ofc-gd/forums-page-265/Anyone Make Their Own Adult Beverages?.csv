Grappa comes from the last squeezings of grape, and from wine that didn't quite turn out right. As for shine, it was always made from whatever fruit was leftover. Old apples in the cellar, canned fruit turned brown from age, soft taters, etc... It all boiled down nicely. Used to be easy to find locals who kept a cooker in back somewhere."

Most apples finish at 6-7% with no sugar added if you let it sit until fermentation stops naturally. You'd need to add a ton of sugar and use a high alcohol producing yeast to get that high of an alcohol content. I imagine you'd need to back sweeten that with a bunch of sweetener to make it drinkable.   Reminds me of my first batch of red wine I made when I was 18-19 which turned out to be over 14%. One bottle and you're beyond tipsy and I still feel bad for the hotel cleaners who had to clean all that pink puke off the sheets a couple times while I was working in Windsor

You might have to distill twice.  David (Hick!!)  aka  Superdad    You are correct about acetone production. There is also methanol which is even worse. They are the most volatile of the alcohols and as such boil @ the lowest temp and come off first. This is why the fore shots (between 50ml and 200ml depending on distillation method) are discarded. The heads ( early safe distillate) and tails (late distillate) are mostly recycled in the next run as they contain off flavours that can adversely effect  taste. You are then left with the hearts which is the purest ethanol that is saved.  Technically illegal yes but there are tens of thousands of people making for their own consumption. I certainly wouldn't be selling any to anyone as this will get you in a heap of trouble in a hurry."
