826186,wormdunker,2013-12-23 09:54:00,1711,Newf - that's too bad about the split of those huge limbs.  Looks like a crane & bucket job to me.

826227,Joey,2013-12-23 16:53:00,9122,Well there has been way more damage since I took these yesterday.  Lots more trees gone today  My van in the front drive    This is in my backyard.  The neighbors black willow is slowly taking out my birch and my cedar hedge.                                  An Opportunist                            
826228,darsky,2013-12-23 17:15:00,586,Joey-your part of RH looks much diff than the area that my Bro lives in. Much nicer with the big ol trees.
826236,fishnsled,2013-12-23 18:06:00,3520,"Well no pics to add as of yet as the internet is down at home, fine at work of course.  Neighbourhood is a mess like many other here, went 26 hours or so with no power but came back on around 5am this morning.  Was talking with Headhunter and he's still without power and not sure when he'll get it back.  He had a good neighbour drop off a load of firewood to help him out and is OK for now."
826240,Christopheraaron,2013-12-23 19:18:00,3525,"Can't post pics yet but Joey pretty much summed it up for us, lots and lots of trees split, cable lines across the street in a few places, neighbours power line saw a few branches pull it to the ground (almost ripped it out if the roof). Going on 38 hours with no power for us."
826258,Governator,2013-12-23 20:22:00,879,Up here in Barrie all is good...  Not nearly the ice to report like those south of us.  We just have a lot more snow than any of these pics as usual.
826261,ehg,2013-12-23 20:29:00,2666,"Good of people to put up pics. Luckily i never lost power here at my location.downtown T.O. Know many people a few blocks away that are freezing.     As bad as you guys in Toronto got it (and I DO feel bad for the ones suffering)  it does not even come CLOSE to what I went through back in '98. Multiply it by 5 (total days) and then you can really relate. Most affected had no power for 7-12 days. The military was called in to help clear the trees. I think it was something like 30-50 mm each day. Fond memories. Good luck with the clean up. We just got ice pellets today-no biggie.  The Ottawa- Montreal ice storm of 1998 probably might have been the worse ever in Canada. Had friends in Montreal that had power back after few days. Friends south of Ottawa  around Smith Falls had no power for a few weeks.  Lucked out downtown here but know many not far away that are having a frozen Christmas. This storm  has caused loss of power to well  over half million people in Toronto area. STILL. With the temps. dropping the complaints are going to really increase over next few days.  This might be 2nd biggest ice storm , next to 1998. The population with no power this Christmas is huge."
826267,misfish,2013-12-23 21:25:00,29133,"Snow over night,nothing but blue skies here now.Temps are dropping fast. Thankfully.  Looks like fishing grounds will have 6 inches or more, of frozen slush,and 4-5 inches of black ice come morning.."
826272,Ice Fishing Ham,2013-12-23 22:08:00,83,We had the power out for 36 hours. The ice sure made a mess of the Pine in the back yard not to mention the shed.    The bird feed looked kinda neat.    Got a new vanity plate for the truck.   
826278,ccmtcanada,2013-12-23 22:25:00,7971,I had been spared power loss until 11pm last night.  Luckily it came back on at around 4am...all the lights coming on woke me up!
826351,RangerGuy,2013-12-24 02:29:00,564,"No power since Sunday,fallen branch pulled our hydro wire right out of our meter.  I was airing my young dog she was just starting to poop. When I heard a large crack, I yelled ""here"" a she bolted to me... Another branch just missed her  We were very lucky!  Fixed my hydro meter today, passed inspection now its a waiting game for hydro to hook us up again.  oh I got 5 trees to cut down as well lol!"
826359,irishfield,2013-12-24 03:03:00,26272,"Was a hard push today.. with 8 or 9"" of new snow and 3/4"" of ice on top of it. Gonna be a long winter.... already running out of room to push the snow and I started at 3x the width of the laneway pushing it back onto the lawn! Gotta love living 3500 feet South of Georgian Bay on the high point of land!"
826382,BillM,2013-12-24 03:55:00,17367,"A little salt on the driveway so my 80 year olf neighbours don't break a hip!  Other then that, nothing crazy up here.  More snow then rain."
826384,Joey,2013-12-24 03:58:00,9122,"What a winter wonderland Hun!!!  I took a few more pics this afternoon.  All these old trees that have been in the neighborhood forever, it just breaks my heart.  Some will not make it I'm sure                   And now for the beauty of it, here are some cool photos.  This first one was a stick in the ground at my mother's apartment building.  You couldn't make that ball on the top if you tried.                       "

825919,ccmtcanada,2013-12-22 13:38:00,7971,Street lights lit this up like a Christmas tree last night   Woke up today to see branches from town trees broken and resting on my fence....     About 2cm of ice build up on everything.   I'm glad I have nowhere to go today!

Was just going to plow as it didn't look like it was doing anything outside, and the radar shows nothing, but stepping out the door realized it's raining so I'll just throw another log in the fire and put my feet up!"
825952,Fisherman,2013-12-22 15:40:00,7201,"Is that FF hosing down the power line?  Ya, another 3-4 inches of snow a thin crust of ice and that's it."
