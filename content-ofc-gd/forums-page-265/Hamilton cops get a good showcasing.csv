824446,Twocoda,2013-12-15 23:04:00,4130,i know eh ...then when he realizes the camera he wants a spit hood...to cover up ...i watched it maybe 10 times and dont see him spit ....actually he just finished complimenting the one cop for being a gentleman...total brutality for sure
824511,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-16 06:05:00,8243,"The guy that took the video was apparently fired from the store he worked at. He left the store unattended to hassle Mark and his partner. Looks good on him.  I love when the clerk from the video store taking the video says "" I know the law dude, I took the law and did good in it"", I guess he didn't decide to make it his career."

824529,manitoubass2,2013-12-16 12:18:00,11391,"With the amount of policing this days and the abuses of law and authority, is anyone really surprised that civilians are video taping at any chance they get?  When we are constantly under a video camera citizens will do the same to those in positions of authority. That being said, i will agree that there are ignorant and criminal citizens as well as ignorant and criminal cops. Works both ways. Ah the times we live in. People are afraid of being shot or tazed for nothing or silly little violations. This is what you end up with..."
824576,ch312,2013-12-16 17:37:00,1590,"In my opinion he was harassing the cops while they were trying to do their job. Record it; by all means but if you aren't going to be part of the solution then stay out of the way! They had their hands full as it was trying to get her to settle down. That idiot shooting his mouth off wasn't helping at all. But that is just MHO  I see where you're coming from and it's gotta be hard for cops to deal with that crap, but cops are trained to deal with situations such as this and these cops did exactly what they're supposed to do. Arresting someone simply because they are voicing their opinion would be an abuse of power and a perfect example of this was the G20 crap where police detained peaceful protesters and even people who were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Arresting the cameraman would have resulted in another ""abuse of power"" video rather than everyone praising them.   And no, I'm not anti police. That chick on the ground should have met Mr. Taser"

824796,Rich,2013-12-17 13:02:00,3927,"Oh for sure, dont get me wrong. I said 'less' as in certainly less than our Norfolk OPP ... All I see is abuse of power from those guys.  I think the Hamilton cops just keep busier and don't have as much time to stray away for kicks.  I dunno. All I hear is what I hear, I'm no cop and couldn't imagine dealing with the things they do on a daily basis. I'm glad there's some strong enough to stay true to their duties."
824798,lew,2013-12-17 13:10:00,12766,"There's thousands of fantastic cops all across this county that do an amazing job of keeping things safe for us and we never hear a word about them.  But when one goes bad, it's all anyone talks about."
824813,fishing n autograph,2013-12-17 15:37:00,2540,Yup. I've never had a public complaint and I go about doing my job the same way every day. I work with 40 fantastic hard working guys who are just like me.  Like Lew said 1 guy gets in trouble and that's all that anyone talks about.
824831,aplumma,2013-12-17 17:59:00,6896,Truth is I have never had a bad police officer talk to me ever. I have had 2 tickets in my life and both of them were my fault. They treated me as well as I treated them and there are no hard feelings. I talk to a lot of them unofficially when I get the chance and they put their pants on one leg at a time same as I do. It is a job that most do not want because of the attitude some people give the police who are keeping things safe for all of us.  Hats off to everyone who does a job that is dangerous or unpleasant so we all can live a better  or safer life.   Art
824945,HTHM,2013-12-18 02:49:00,4082,"And now they have to deal with this tragedy: http://www.thespec.com/news-story/4276167-police-officer-not-expected-to-survive-shooting/  A Hamilton police officer critically injured in a shooting at the central police station Tuesday afternoon is not expected to survive. That's the word from Hamilton police in a statement issued just before 6 p.m. The officer shot himself in the locker room of the King William Street station after 1 p.m. Police said the officer was in critical condition in hospital. Hamilton police Chief Glenn De Caire issued a ""must read memo"" to staff informing them of a critical incident at the building, The Spectator has learned. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the officer's family and we will support them in every way,"" Police Chief Glenn De Caire said in the public statement. ""Our Critical Incident Response Team is now responding to support our members through this."" The chief has asked Halton police to conduct an investigation into the incident. Police said it is a ""non-criminal investigation."" Police said the chief or any member of the service will not provide any further comment on the incident and the service is asking the news media to ""be respectful of our members and service at this time."" Officers from other stations were called in to cover for their colleagues at the central station following the shooting."

It's about on par with an 8 year old throwing a temper tantrum, anyway here's the link!    here's the CBC story on it too.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/hamilton-police-arrest-video-goes-viral-1.2461046  The guy who takes the video makes himself look like an absolute knob too which is also really funny."

The cameraman did nothing that was against the law and was simply recording an event occurring in a public place. If it weren't for video cameras there would be far more police brutality and no punishment for those who choose to abuse their power as the police never do anything wrong, unless there is evidence to prove otherwise. There is nothing better than video evidence.  That pathetic excuse for a cop from Barrie who beat a guy while he was handcuffed being a perfect example.   Every cop should be forced to wear a camera with audio which records their activities from the start of their shift right until they head home. Not only would this prevent brutality and corruption, it would also help the police in the event of a lawsuit claiming brutality or excessive force as well as being a very valuable training aid for other cops."

Bernie is the chair of the Hamilton Police Service's Board. He is one proud pop. Marks probably been hearing about what it means to be a good cop his whole life from Dad.  Bernie hasn't been well and hasn't been able to attend to his civic duties for a while now, hope he's feeling better.  Way to go Mark.  Rich there's good and bad everywhere, there are some really bad cops in Hamilton. Problem is you never hear about the really good one's."
