825281,Squid,2013-12-19 18:56:00,1656,It was not my intention to make this a attack on public employees more of a I hate Service Canada Employment Insurance Division rant.  I have used other services of Service Canada and Ontario with no issues what so ever.  Sorry I brought it up... Sorry for the thread being hijacked....
825302,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-19 20:54:00,4399,No problem...I should have know better than to start this type thread in the first place.

825339,lookinforwalleye,2013-12-20 00:58:00,4399,Really....appreciate the contribution...  :wallbash:
825348,Rod Caster,2013-12-20 01:29:00,5784,As good of a contributation as a government-service-rant topic is on a fishing forum I suppose.
825373,SirCranksalot,2013-12-20 03:00:00,3291,"And the difference in service between the two is......?  See post 21--one is federal, one is provincial."
825398,Fish Farmer,2013-12-20 13:44:00,2234," I feel your pain... Then again if you went to get your fishing licence at Service Canada which is the federal government, it would have been really interesting if someone could have helped you. Fishing licences come from the ONTARIO government.  No offence LOL. Isn't our fishing licence now an U.S. thing now. Something else we lost. I know the new hunting card looks like crap.  Lew, Don't feel bad buddy. I worked at Stelco and everyone said Stelco workers went there to sleep, I got painter as-well. We did have a few Fresh-Air-Thieves as I called them. We have politicians, then we have workers. Merry Christmas Lew"
825399,lew,2013-12-20 13:57:00,12766,"I don't don't feel bad Dave, just get tired of the crap somedays but all's good.  Merry Christmas to you & yours as well my friend !!"

A week and a half ago I went to the one in Barrie,  10 wickets, 7 tellers or agents.  6 were for healt cards and D/L.  1 was there for fish/hunt licence renewal.  I stood there while she dealt with a welfare scam artist.  I even asked if any of the others were cross trained, it was like I was asking for the impossible..that's why I think of them as Beans."

If I could go back in time I'd have gone for a goverment job, little work, lots of money!  I have to agree with Lew.... painting a pretty broad stroke there. Also aren't your licence bureaus franchised out. The one where I live is and the one in the town I work in is as well.  I laughed when I went to get my last plate renewal, I walked in and there was NO ONE there? I went outside and here was the OWNER of the franchise looking at and sitting in a car that a guy had bought his wife (a friend of hers) as a gift for her 60th birthday... She hadn't seen me go in, but headed in right away. I had to stand there for 20 more minutes while she got him his personalized plates and discuss what kind of scalloped potatoes she should bring to the party that night. Then just when it was my turn a dealer walked in and she told me to wait because the dealer had called and needed a set of plates for a car that was being picked up right away.... This is in a town of 8000 people so much for small town hospitality. I asked who owned the franchise so I could call them later and complain, she grinned and said you are talking to her."

Well you got three out of four, no more printer.  The last one was used may 3 times a year, the ink dried up and cost more than the darn printer, otherwise I would have gone that route.

824883,porkpie,2013-12-17 23:17:00,2521,"Having spent a considerable amount of time in the public service, I can say with no doubt that there are plenty of useless slugs.  There are however many outstanding, hard working individuals that work on a 24 hour basis to keep the wheels from falling off the bus.  I have watched guys freeze their cans off to fix a main break at 3am at minus 30, while working their buts off, to the guys i saw driving the plows all night last night to clear the roads. i have seen people go out if their way to find info on things they have absolutely nothing to do with, just to help out a member of the public.  I've seen this over and over, and fortunately I can say that I have seen more good than bad, however there is no question that a small section of the public service feels entitled to whatever they can get, for as little effort as possible.  But guess what, I worked in the private sector previous to this, and saw a fair number of those same useless slugs doing the same thing, and I saw many of them keep jobs past the point where they should've been let go.  Anyone collecting a government paycheck is going to be a natural target for those that assume we are getting a better deal.  That is part of the gig, and I long ago stopped worrying about it!"
