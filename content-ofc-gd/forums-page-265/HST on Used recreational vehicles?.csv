826315,Skud,2013-12-24 00:23:00,739,I have been trying to find a definite answer to that question online but can not find any info on paying tax on a used atv when I buy one privately. Anyone know the deal on this? I would guess that it includes boats.

826322,porkpie,2013-12-24 00:43:00,2521,You must pay HST when transferring the bike into your name regrettably.
826325,krixxer,2013-12-24 01:04:00,274,I've registered a few thing under the bartering system. Cars go by the book but things get iffy with motorcycles boats etc.. try it if you can get the owner to collaborate
826329,GBW,2013-12-24 01:43:00,8460,"You should pay taxes on your ""purchase price"" but if the price is too low for the Govt then they audit it and make you pay a min. tax.  So if you buy a quad for $3500 and they seller says ""$100"" then when you go to Svc ON they ding you on what is Fare Market Value according to them.  That's how they taxed me on my tinny when I bought it off a friend of the family.  Considering my purchase price was much lower than FMV according to them."
826385,Nipfisher,2013-12-24 04:04:00,2449,"Get the bill of sale to say ""Sold as-is"" or ""for parts"" then the seller can put a nominal amount like $200-$500. Geoff is right though if it is a 2010 600cc bike/sled then they wont accept $500 as the sale price.  Other thing is if you buy a boat on a trailer then only the trailer is transferable so get the bill of sale to say $100 for the trailer (boat and motor can be any amount). Trailer can also be registered as home-made so registration/ownership is not as important as it is on a sled/bike."
