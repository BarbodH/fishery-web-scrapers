824451,Sinker,2013-12-15 23:29:00,8692,"Where u stayin....what resort?  Been a few times. Fishing can be good from the bridges at night, and at slack tide.  S."
824588,jimmer,2013-12-16 18:35:00,2730,"I actually saw some nice size fish right on the beach early in the morning. Kind of kicked myself for not bringing a rod. You obviously cross a causeway to get to the island, so that's a possibility also. I'm surprised that they don't push the fishing more, because the mangroves look amazing."
824597,Sinker,2013-12-16 19:17:00,8692,"If your at the right resort, there is some great shore fishing.  The bridges are decent, but nothing to really get excited about. Will you catch fish? Absolutley, will it be the trip of a lifetime? Nope!  S."
824609,fishingwithbob,2013-12-16 20:11:00,123,Just walk down by the “clothing optional” beach area and fish near the rocks there.  Watched some nice cuda’s come out from there.  You may not like the view though
824661,Headhunter,2013-12-16 23:16:00,5703,"Yah, but how was the fishing? HH"
824663,aplumma,2013-12-16 23:27:00,6896,I don't know if I want to see a blazing white winter burned person naked getting their first chunk of sun.    Art
824817,fishingwithbob,2013-12-17 16:05:00,123,"Yah, but how was the fishing? HH  Saw a couple of needle fish there too, but then again it was pretty cold out that day"
824826,highdrifter,2013-12-17 17:14:00,2534,Causeway between Cayo Coco and Moron holds fish in the openings when the tide goes out.. Got a few cudas and jacks closer to Moron...  Made friends with a dude at the resort and rented a car... drove around and fished all week..  It was a blast!!
824836,aznphil,2013-12-17 18:28:00,73,"I stayed at Memories.  To fish shoreline you will need to hike or get car transportation, the lagoons are in the back holding fish, best bridge is the one next to the Delphinaria (Dolphin pen).  I booked the fly fishing for ~$290, no tarpon caught just jacks, staff is so-so.  Am told not to book the deep water excursion.  PS Don't fish by the beach i picked up hooks and sinkers left by morons.....ppl are everywhere snorkelling..."
