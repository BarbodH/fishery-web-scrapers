825232,Raf,2013-12-19 14:09:00,3495,"wormdunker, Art gave you the way to size an inverter.  I agree, running deep cycles + inverter in not ideal if you get hit with an extended outage however, the genny was not in the budget this year hence my battery backup solution.  at least being a fisherman, i know my deep cycles are in good shape though!"
825238,wormdunker,2013-12-19 14:46:00,1711,"Thanx for your replies.  Sounds like a gas genny is the way to go.  I like Honda generators, used them at work - they're bullett proof & quiet!  Any comments on which gen to purchase?"
825240,Entropy,2013-12-19 15:02:00,747,"If you are running a sump pump get one that is at lest 2700 watt running, and at least 3000 watt start up.  I picked up my 3000/4000 champion at CTC for $300, comes with a wheel kit.  Had one with out a wheel kit in the past and am glad I have with now.  Steer away from the 1000 / 1200 watt ones, as many will agree they are not suitable for most sump pumps."

Not sure what you find paranoid about being prepared for winter storms Shane, infact I seem to recall you talking recently about having good winter tires on your car, so isn't that being ready for a storm ??  Extra firewood for a wood stove, maybe a generator to run the essentials in your home, some flashlights nearby for when the power goes out, maybe a full propane tank for the BBQ ??  I carry a box in my truck with extra warm clothes and spare winter boots, a box of sand and a shovel....just in case.  I dunno, but I always admire folks who are ready for what Mother Nature throws at them, rather than the guy who just sits back, does nothing, and then whine because a big snow storm caught him off guard."

I have listed them below - items ready to be put into action if necessary. 1 - airtight wood stove in the basement along with 4 cords of dry wood 2 -  coleman cook stove & coleman lantern - fuel for both 3 -  natural gas BBQ for cooking 4  - candles, waterproof matches, approximately 7 flashlights 5 -  600 watt motomaster eliminator power inverter 6 - Mr. Heater Buddy & several 1lb propane bottles 7 -  Propane heater that attaches to a 20 lb propane bottle - (just filled the bottle yesterday!) 8 - 2 deep cycle batteries, 2 different inverters.  Do you guys know what size of inverter I need to power my sump pump? 9 - brand new zippo lighter 10 -  2 brand new zippo hand warmers (the metal type u fill with lighter fluid).  I just purchased them for the upcoming hard water season. 11 - 2012 Polaris atv, filled with gas - ready for an emergency run to the beer store!!"
825222,aplumma,2013-12-19 13:06:00,6896,Raf   I have a sump & deep cycle batteries.  What type of inverter do I need to power my sump in an emergency?  Thanx Look on the tag and see if it lists the amp draw of the sump pump. take that number and multiply it by 120 volts then multiply it by 1.5 the final # is the watts needed to start and run the sump pump. I personally would not go the battery route because they need to always be charged and the amount of energy they store is finite. Most systems that run a battery sump pump find that they ignore them till they don't work. Take the same watts formula and buy a small generator then you can rotate it from the sump to the freezer or other appliance and keep more than one item running. The smaller units are quieter and use less gas than the bigger ones so the impact on the neighbors is minimum.   Art
