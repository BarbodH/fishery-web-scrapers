825530,Fish Farmer,2013-12-20 23:34:00,2234," Do you use the traditional smooth bore with no optics while shooting rifled slugs? I did when I began hunting deer 11-12 years ago and my maximum effective range was 75 yards under ideal conditions. Then I bought a rifled barrel, 1.5-4.5 x 32mm scope, a few boxes of sabots, and was amazed that my groups at 150 yards were the same as the ""traditional"" setup would shoot at 50 yards.  Today's slug guns and sabots are basically short range rifles. I really recommend the H&R single shots for a very accurate gun at a low price and I'll never shoot a 12 gauge slug again after shooting the 20 gauge. I agree with you on shooting on a still target. But most deer that we see in the controlled hunt are on the move. Even at 40 yards your lucky to get a good kill shot. Yes, I use a smooth deer barrel with fiber optic sights. Model 12 Winchester that was custom modified by Elies gunsmith in Simcoe. I still have the original barrel for duck shooting."

I still have the original barrel for duck shooting.  I tagged a deer yesterday at 34 yards with my crossbow as it was walking left to right in thick cover.  This season I didn't use a stand or shotgun and did nothing but still hunt with the crossbow. This is the 4th deer I've taken in 4 seasons while still hunting with the crossbow with shots being at 11, 12, 20, and 34 yards. You sure learn a lot about your quarry when still hunting with a bow and sneaking up to them at such close range.  A 40 yard shot with a slug should be a guaranteed kill, unless the drivers in your group are pushing the bush too quickly and loudly resulting in running deer rather than deer that are slowly moving away from the drivers. Having the drivers move slowly and quietly towards the blockers usually results in much easier shots and the groups who do this tend to be more successful than the groups who simply go stomping through the bush making all kinds of racket. You may benefit from using buckshot by the sounds of it, providing you're willing to spend the money finding the load that your gun/choke combination shoots the best as what patterns great in one gun may be worthless in another.  My crossbow shoots tighter groups at 50 yards than the majority of smooth bore shotguns I've seen or used at the same range."

825121,aplumma,2013-12-18 22:49:00,6896,My favorite is snap shooting at rabbits. You get a tractor and bushhog and make a large square. you post one man on each corner shooting in one direction. As the tractor cuts the square from the outside in the rabbits jump out and run thru the cleared section. The action is fast and the shooting is challenging. We also used to wade thru the swamps and shoot squirrel from the trees. Find a squirrel post one man on the tree and the other person walks to the other side to chase him around till one of you gets a shot. While hunting is a lot of fun I also like to target shoot using bowling pins swinging on a rope. We use pistols at close range and back off for the rifles at one range we had a 50 Caliber sniper rifle shooting at a 12 inch disk at 800 yards. While it was costing $5.00 a shot  the excitement of hitting the gong was worth every penny.   Art

The process of cutting the field is something that is needed to be done  the rabbits are just a byproduct of the job. I can remember the sheriff and a few local politicians being on the hunt from time to time.  Mainly good memories from a time that has passed...

Off a rest and with a scope mounted, 3"" groups at 125 yards and 4"" at 150 yards with Remington copper solids was the norm. At 100 yards using the rifle sights it would shoot 4"" groups all day long, but the price of sabots limited the fun.

Good enough for me.  S. What Sinker said, I too use an 870 and no problem at 70-100 yards with a slug.  Now I do have one place where I hunt and use buckshot, actually I use a Remington 3"" magnum 00 buck buffered load and the longest shot I have made with it was about 70 yards and I did drop the deer. The thing most guys do wrong with buck shot at the longer distances is they think they have to aim high, believe me you don't, hold right on target or you will be shooting over the deer. (same thing goes for slugs too)  At 80 yards you are going to have ""about"" a 4' spread, with 15 pellets (lots of variables here, barrel length/choke/buffered/non buffered/ ........ (and they will still have plenty of volicity) there is a very good chance you will put a couple in the lung/heart area. I'm not suggesting that you go out with 00 buck and start shooting deer at 70 or 80 yards but it is capable of dropping a deer at that range.  As for damage to the meat, I've seen as much or more damaged meat from slugs as I have from buck shot, again so many variables!  As for your gun choice; well I have had my Remington 870 for probably 25 years now, it has been dragged through the mud, wet, frozen, in short used hard and this thing just keeps doing it's job. Not fancy but a good solid well built gun!"

824227,richyb,2013-12-14 15:11:00,774,depends on your hunting situation. If you are still hunting and may have a 100 yard shot I would go with slugs. If you are hunting with other people dogging deer that will be running hard and close to you then buckshot is the way to go.

824560,ch312,2013-12-16 16:06:00,1590,"    Those companies who make the buckshot, professional hunters, hunting guides, and ethical hunters who use buckshot each season all recommend using buckshot at typical bow hunting ranges with an absolute maximum of 40-50 yards. A 4 ft pattern is not to be considered adequate for any animal and I cannot being to understand how anyone in their right mind would even attempt such a ridiculous shot. Buckshot doesn't have spectacular penetration at 50 yards and at 75 yards each 00 pellet will have less than 100 ft/lbs of energy meaning you'll be very luck to penetrate the offside lung and any experienced knows that a deer with a one intact lung can run very far. I've rolled coyotes at 50-55 yards with 00 buck and penetration wasn't very impressive, even though they're smaller with much smaller rib bones than deer.  Visit any hunting forum and start a poll asking the maximum effective range of buckshot and I'll bet less than 1% would suggest using buckshot for any animal over 50-60 yards."
