826113,BIG FISH,2013-12-23 01:01:00,54,"hey folks, just a quick video of a walleye trip from this fall, caught tons of fish, but always gotta let the big girls go!  do you practice catch and release???  "
826126,gaspumper,2013-12-23 01:48:00,393,Anything over 3 lbs goes back.
826131,vance,2013-12-23 01:57:00,719,The big breeders always go back if they are mine and I am not above SHAMING anyone who I am fishing with to let theirs go to !!!!!!!!!   vance
826156,Acountdeleted,2013-12-23 03:49:00,2562,I approve of these messages and follow them as well. I like the taste of the 1-1.5 pound walleyes better anyways.
826210,Rich,2013-12-23 14:44:00,3927,Catch and release 'big' anything!
826214,limeyangler,2013-12-23 15:08:00,5204,"I agree with catching and releasing the big ones, however I will occasionally keep one if I have a fish fry event on the horizon.  That being said if it became law that you could not keep anything over a certain size i would strictly adhere to that regulation. On certain lakes I fish I release all the big fish as they won't, in my opinion, handle the pressure like some of the bigger bodies of water."
826218,mike rousseau,2013-12-23 15:46:00,4661,Big is relative to the fishery....
826219,GbayGiant,2013-12-23 15:48:00,1780,Size limits are dictated by the OMNR. I follow their Regulations and do not need OPO's  Cheers  
826220,dave524,2013-12-23 15:59:00,4508,"Big is relative to the fishery....  So, true. Fish over 5 pounds are normal on Erie. Y'all  go hungry looking for 1 to 1 1/2 pound eater size fish. Unless you're talking about the perch"
826222,grt1,2013-12-23 16:13:00,638,"the tourist camps on our lake have had a policy of no walleye over 18 inches for years and the fishing has improved immensely and most of the US visitors I see with big fish, now take pictures and release the big ones.  the locals here though have a different feeling and follow the regulations that allows one over the slot size"
826223,ch312,2013-12-23 16:16:00,1590," So, true. Fish over 5 pounds are normal on Erie. Y'all  go hungry looking for 1 to 1 1/2 pound eater size fish. Unless you're talking about the perch  x 2  I've only been trolling on Erie for a couple years and have caught dozens of walleye so far with only one being under 20""...around 2 1/2 - 3 lbs I'd guess. The fish in the video may be big for the body of water that you're fishing, but on Erie those fish are under the average size from what I've seen."
