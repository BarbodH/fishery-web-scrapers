825765,aplumma,2013-12-21 21:31:00,6896,I think I found me a new best friend. I am a sucker for sweet types of breads. nice job.   Art
825773,206,2013-12-21 21:48:00,563,WoW... I bought a tube of Pillsbury chocolate chunk cookie dough but it never even made it to the oven
825774,Roy,2013-12-21 21:48:00,13728,"Looks great, Bruce. I'm sure they won't last long.  Art, don't call them ""sweetbreads"" here. Sweetbreads are something entirely different. J loves them, I make them for her but I need a lot of sauce to get them down."
825779,aplumma,2013-12-21 22:08:00,6896,Yea I promise yaa that the other sweetbread is one I haven't had to eat in years I just don't care for organ meat for the most parts.   Art
825807,wormdunker,2013-12-21 23:50:00,1711,Way to go Ugly!  My family is Slovak.  Gramma used to bake poppy seed cakes & walnut bread.  I purchased some in Windsor last week at the local market.  Almost as good as gramma's.  Pulla looks awesome!!

825828,limeyangler,2013-12-22 00:26:00,5204,"The swedes do a similar style thing…forgotten the name of it, used to eat loads when i lived there as a kid. looks great even without the marzipan…now all you need is my address to send a parcel"
825830,bigugli,2013-12-22 00:32:00,6138,"The other bread would be vetebrod, something I have not seen made in near 40 years With any of these braids, nothing beats fresh from the oven with a big dollop of fresh churned spread on top."
825835,Fisherman,2013-12-22 00:57:00,7201,"Well we have audio and video, thank god there's no smello meter attached to the computer.  Cardamom cookies, where did I put last years recipe.  Got to try my hand at cinnimon rolls again, but not that pilsbury junk."
