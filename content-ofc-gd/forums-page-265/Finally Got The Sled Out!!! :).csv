The trails are still pretty rough and could use more snow but I have seen them worse.  Went out for a short 2 hour shakedown cruise to make sure all is good and to let my sledding muscles remember what to do. It usually takes me a couple of rides to get back into riding shape.  Took a couple of pics while out on the big lake.    We are supposed to get some snow tonight and tomorrow and ahead of the front we got a kick donkey sun dog.
