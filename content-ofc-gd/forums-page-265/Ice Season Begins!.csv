825113,Rich,2013-12-18 22:28:00,3927,"Now, don't get me wrong. The ice isn't safe. We had to walk and spud our way around this particular place to find 4"". Most places were not even walkable. That's why backgrounds are blurred. I don't want anyone assuming the whole place is safe from my post and having an accident.  BUT.... when we found safe ice - we found some beautiful kickoff pike!        I'm sure the time is very near that we can confidently walk wherever we feel like, but that time is not now!! If you're going out anywhere in southwestern ontario bring a spud and use it OFTEN. You can be on 4"" next step could be 1""..  I even likely won't risk it again until I hear the place has a good 3-4"" all the way across. It was sketchy. Lol  Stay safe and happy early ice season!"

825158,Rod Caster,2013-12-19 01:17:00,5784,"great start! can't wait for mine.... and we already have 8"" haha"
825162,GBW,2013-12-19 01:35:00,8460,"The good news Rich is you guys were smart, safe AND got into some fish to top it off.  Good on ya!"
825163,limeyangler,2013-12-19 01:39:00,5204,great stuff Rich.
825172,John Bacon,2013-12-19 02:14:00,3277,"I got out on Sunday too.  A good 5"" of clear ice where I was fishing.  I was one for two with the pike.  I hope to be back out this weekend.  http://s1204.photobucket.com/user/tennis_pwn/media/P1010370.jpg.html?sort=3&o=0"
825277,Rich,2013-12-19 18:52:00,3927,Nice pike JB!! They were on fire everywhere on Sunday I guess! Haha
825279,NAW,2013-12-19 18:55:00,4022,Nice!  I never go first ice with out my float suite though...
825517,pidge,2013-12-20 22:48:00,438,"Nice catch man. You guys are braver than me  I like your rod holder, it appears you don't have to bed over. Is that homemade? Be careful out there fellas."
825542,Rich,2013-12-21 00:14:00,3927,"It's an HT Tip-Down rod holder, its supposed to rocket the rod into the little lock if there's a fish on.. it usually tips right over if it gets a strike that hard but indeed it is nice not to have to bend over!"
825593,Richie Razor,2013-12-21 02:07:00,536,Nice Stinky pike day.
