The fact that you are comparing homosexuality to bestiality and pedophilia is absolutely ridiculous.  There is a reason why everyone in society agrees the latter two are despicable acts.... because children and animals cannot consent to sex.  On the other hand, what two consenting gay adults want to do does not affect anyone.  I couldnt care less what 2 gay dudes want to do in the privacy of their own home.  The fact that you also bring up the recent prostitution case also shows me you have not read the decision and are just typing based on your own morality and not facts.  There is a reason why all three levels of court and 9-0 unanimous decision by the supreme court said that current prostitution laws are unconstitutional... because as much as it may shock you, prostitutes are humans too and have the right to protect themselves and not be murdered.  The court's decision was really a no-brainer and was based on the law and not on religious morality.... the way it should be with our impartial judiciary"

There were many myths and still are many about the disease, they have tracked it back atleast 70 years but the end result is that the patient zero is recorded as having slept with over 1,000 men (many after he knew about the infection) and from that point is spread among the homosexual population and then continued to spread through bi-sexual and heterosexual sex, prostitution increased the spread rapidly in Africa and Asia.  So what where her conclusions that differ from mine?  Come now... you can't honestly believe the universe popped out of nothing and that enzymes, proteins, DNA, cell membranes can for by chance, even the die hard hate-thiest like Richard Dawkins talks about Pan-spermia now  and even Christopher Hitchen's brother became a Christian after he decided to open his mind.

It depends on where you are it ranges from a river we use jetdrive boats on because it is shallow up to 28ft Cruiser I have on the lower Potomac river. The areas are only 60 miles apart by road. It can also be run down to the ocean in 4 hours. The upper Potomac is rich in it's small mouth bass and channel catfish. Lower down below  Great Falls you can pick up walleye in a very few selected areas as well as some trophy small mouth. You continue down river where it is still freshwater and will fish for large mouth , striper bass, shad, 4 different species of catfish including the 60lb + blue catfish and the fun to catch snake-heads. We then enter into the brackish to saltwater and then you can fish for 10 different species that are fun and great eating. To fish it effectively you actually need from a canoe to a 30ft bay boat. If you are getting back down here shoot me a P.M. if our schedules are good we can go for a blast or I can give you a few tips on the area.   Art"

As far as i can tell most of the storm here is over this guy saying that homosexuality is a sin. I could not disagree with this more wholeheartedly. Here is a perfect example of what i was just talking about above.  Was Phil being hateful/homophobic? I've certainly heard worse, but to say this is ok…IN MY OPINION….because it is informed by faith in a particular religion does not wash, some very nasty things (note i refrain using the word 'evil' because of its religious baggage) have been done in history that were quite ok at the time because this or that deity said it was.  Things change over time, I remember as a kid stuff that was blatantly racist and sexist was acceptable on TV, this is no longer the case because people campaigned to change that, challenging the power structures(read religion among others)that perpetuated these hateful, bigoted myths.   So…back to what Phil said……there is a clip on youtube that I love.

Phil spoke his mine in what he believes. You must not believe in the bible or a religion.  Secondly your post is no different than what he did, only difference is you weren't being interviewed on GQ.

Actually, i was raised catholic.  So i feel comfortable telling you to keep your pseudo-religious psycho babble to yourself. None of it is relevant here as it pertains to one man pissing on the lifestyle and choices of individuals as it pertains to their sexual interests.  Ah Catholic... no wonder the hostility, I hope you find true Christianity someday is all I will say on that.....  He also ""pissed"" on those sleeping around and other but the media doesn't care about that.  So many seem to be excited about the opprtunity of pissing on his viewpoint and rather intollerent as compared to his views on life  ""in adherence to his Christian faith while pointing out that he “would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me.”     ...“I myself am a product of the ’60s” who indulged in sex and drugs until hitting bottom and accepting Jesus as his saviour, he said in a statement. Although his mission is to teach people that men and women are meant to be together, Robertson said he “would never treat anyone with disrespect” because they are different.  Sadly so many show his views and beliefs no respect it seems so they can dismiss what he has done with his life.  Seems to me he spoke truth though but then those slandering him don't like the full truth...... GQ said he then paraphrases a biblical reference: “Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers — they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.”    Interesting statement I just read on the National Post.  The Robertson family, meanwhile, has released a statement responding to the controversy, in which the Duck Dynasty stars thank fans for their “prayers and support,” and reiterates that Phil Robertson’s “beliefs are grounded in the teachings of the Bible.” “Phil is a Godly man who follows what the Bible says are the greatest commandments: ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart’ and “Love your neighbor as yourself,’ ” the statement reads. “Phil would never incite or encourage hate. We are disappointed that Phil has been placed on hiatus for expressing his faith, which is his constitutionally protected right.” “We are in discussions with A&E to see what that means for the future of Duck Dynasty,” the family continues. “Again, thank you for your continued support of our family.”   I think I will add a DD ""Happy Happy Happy"" shirt to my wish list."

He has that right just as A&E has the right to fire an employee who they felt violated their code of conduct.  You cause your employers headaches...they might let you go.  It's the same for all of us and has NOTHING to do with free speech.  I'll bet very few people who feel Phil's first amendment rights were violated felt the same when Bill Mayer got fired for his 9/11 comment about the relative courage of a suicide attack vs pressing a button that launches a missile.  People are usually more eager to stand up for ""freedom of speech"" when they agree with the speaker.  Duck Dynasty is without a doubt the single most contrived ""realty show"" I have ever seen.  Phil must have been aware that the Hollywood liberals who produce the show orchestrate every move they make and word they say...and that they're not going to stand by and let him jeopardize the revenue stream they've got going on.  A&E probably over-reacted, and since (I'm guessing) most DD fans aren't exactly offended by what he said, he'll probably be back on the show after issuing some sort of semi-apologetic statement or ""clarification"".  Moreover, it's quite possible that they're purposefully milking the situation for publicity."

Just a little while back he took issue with the producers of the show because of them editing out some of his biblical beliefs and prayer and the end of each show, they supposedly consided on that note.
