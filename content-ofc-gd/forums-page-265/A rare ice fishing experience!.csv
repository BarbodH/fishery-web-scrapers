826092,NAW,2013-12-22 23:43:00,4022,For those who recognize this location...  It's a rare occasion to be the only one on the lake!!!   I tried 4 other locations first.  Got my car stuck about 10 times!!  Roads where not plowed yet!!  Caught about 20 fish.  Tossed back the dinks!  Came back with 10 just to keep the little man happy!

826172,Moosebunk,2013-12-23 06:23:00,3970,Lotsa slush and snow will probably keep a good few of the walkers off the ice.  This year might be tougher all around for many wanting distant access.  Good day out for ya dood!
826184,wormdunker,2013-12-23 09:34:00,1711,Good on ya!  Awesome pic of your little guy!  He'll be joining you on the ice real soon.  Merry Christmas to you & your family Nick.
826198,NAW,2013-12-23 13:31:00,4022,Thanks guys.  I was a soupy mess out there.  Some places it was over my knees!  And the freezing rain never really let up all morning.  Still a fun time though!

826249,jedimaster,2013-12-23 19:49:00,3472,Is there a river behind you to the right with a bridge? If so I recognize that exact spot actually. Surprised that no one was out on the sunken island or out near the bouy yet.
