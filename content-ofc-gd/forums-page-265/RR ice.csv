Shoveled te snow off and had good cold days since:) ventured down this am after coffee, drilled my way out with my new shark and made it 30-40 ft out with 11"". So out we go to play with some fishies and new toys:) my new auger is amazing, love it. Got it on the cheap too$175 used once. Now im anxious to try my brand new 4x elite:) weather is nice, bout -13 should br diwn there all day! Letshope the fish cooperate but will be fun regardless."
