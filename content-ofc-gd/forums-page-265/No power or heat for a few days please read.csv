Turn off the main water and open all of the faucets both hot and cold. If you have a drain valve or bleed on the main water valve open that also. Turn off the breaker to the water heater you can drain the heater if you want it is not likely to freeze over a day or two.. Flush the toilets and then add antifreeze to the tank and the bowls as well as the traps in the sinks. Finally dump a little in the dishwasher and the washer machine. This should try to keep you from having frozen pipes and slit pipes. If you have a question feel free to P.M. me I will answer them as quickly as I can.   Art
