825413,miami,2013-12-20 14:46:00,29,"I have read and re-read the 2014 Reg's and if I can't get an answer from members - in the know - on this excellent forum, I guess my next move would be to contact the MNR.  As a senior (66yrs and counting) what am I allowed to possess? My limit would fall under - Sport or Conservation - (need help on this as I could find nothing in the reg's)?  Lastly, I do not want to take my hard copy Provincial drivers lic onto the Ice. Would not a Photocopy be sufficient to provide proof of age?  Getting old is worst than growing up...................lol  Thanks for taking the time,  Robert"

825430,vance,2013-12-20 15:23:00,719,"You always do as I just did,for $9.95 you can get a fishing out doors card from the MNR that is good for 3 years and thats all the ID you need..   vance"
825434,miami,2013-12-20 15:35:00,29,"Thank you Terry - I kinda thought so, but better to be sure than sorry.  Vance - I was not aware I could purchase an Outdoor Card for the 3 years - Thank you for info. Going Monday to Service Ontario.  Robert"
825438,Christopheraaron,2013-12-20 15:48:00,3525,"yup, it is sport."
825440,Old Man,2013-12-20 15:50:00,822,"Robert, you don't need an Outdoors Card to fish if you're 65 years of age and older and an Ontario or Canadian resident. All you need is any form of Federal or Provincial Government ID that proves your age. Your Drivers License or Health Card is all all you would need to carry while fishing."
825442,Christopheraaron,2013-12-20 15:52:00,3525,All you need is any form of Federal or Provincial Government ID that proves your age. Your drivers license or Health Card is all all you would need to carry while fishing. Does health card really cut it? I thought it had to be photo...
825444,Old Man,2013-12-20 15:55:00,822,"Regs just say any form of Government Issued ID Federal, Provincial or Territorial, that has your name on it and date of birth. Doesn't say anything about photo ID."
825445,Terry,2013-12-20 15:55:00,14456,many new health cards are  now photo id
825453,miami,2013-12-20 16:16:00,29,"Terry's right. I had my Health Crad renewed in July - Photo on it. I think I'll just stick with my original plan and Phot copy my driv lic. Geez I'd hate to drop that in a hole, Thanks guys, Robert"
825455,BillM,2013-12-20 16:18:00,17367,Sport.  Any government issued ID will be fine for proof of age.
825489,Fisherman,2013-12-20 20:56:00,7201,Health cards are not allowed to used as ID.  http://A health card cannot be accepted as valid photo ID in many cases because of the Personal Health Information Protection Act
825491,Big Cliff,2013-12-20 21:12:00,6899,"I have been checked a couple of times now and they never asked for proof of age. When asked for a fishing license, I just say don't need one, I'm a senior. So far that has been fine."
825492,BillM,2013-12-20 21:15:00,17367,"I have been checked a couple of times now and they never asked for proof of age. When asked for a fishing license, I just say don't need one, I'm a senior. So far that has been fine.  My old man usually shows him his drivers license.  Although I think out of the 4-5 times we've been checked, they only wanted to see it once."
825497,Old Man,2013-12-20 21:45:00,822,"The exact wording in the Regulations is "" A person is deemed to be the holder of a Recreational Fishing License if they are: Resident of Ontario and Canada under 18 years old, or 65 years of age or older and in possession of any license, permit, certificate, or identification card issued by the Government of Canada or a provincial or territorial government of Canada that indicates their name and date of birth.""  Doesn't mention Photo ID and doesn't exclude Health Cards. The protection of Health Card applies to anyone specifically requesting you to use your Health Card for ID (No one's allowed to ask you for your health card , other than the hospital and the like), same for Social Insurance Cards, not allowed. That said, a person may voluntarily use either as ID if they so wish."
825612,vance,2013-12-21 02:30:00,719,Yeah but cliff LOOKS LIKE a senior   vance
825639,Woodsman,2013-12-21 03:46:00,1286,"A CO can refuse a photo copy. ID must be a government issued card, permit, license or certificate."
825640,irishfield,2013-12-21 03:48:00,26272,Can't refuse a photocopy of a disability parking permit... and they are technically illegal to copy in the first place ... lol
825643,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-21 03:57:00,8243,"A real piece of work CO told a friend the copy of the disability parking permit wasn't valid. So he had a choice to get a ticket for no fishing permit or park a mile from the pond or get a parking ticket. I would have taken the fine for no fishing license and met the guy in court. Or showed him the scars.  There are other ways to prove disability, what if someone doesn't have a parking permit?"
825646,irishfield,2013-12-21 04:17:00,26272,Then the CO would look like a real loser in court. 
825705,Woodsman,2013-12-21 16:09:00,1286,Can't refuse a photocopy of a disability parking permit... and they are technically illegal to copy in the first place ... lol My refference to a police officer refusing a photo copy was in respect to being used as a valid ID. As for a photo copy of an accessible parking permit it is valid for proof of disability for fishing purposes as it is specifically authorized. No such authorization is in affect to use a photo copy for parking purposes.
825706,Beans,2013-12-21 16:20:00,3339,Did sumpin' change ?...When I turned 65 and started getting my OAS and CPP pensions the federal government sent me a senior citizen card...Nice of them to let us know we are old...
825708,Woodsman,2013-12-21 16:28:00,1286,"There are other ways to prove disability, what if someone doesn't have a parking permit? If they wish to fish as a deemed to be a license holder they need a possess either a valid CNIB National Identity Card or an Accessible Parking Permit (photo or electronic copies permitted). Accessible Parking Permits are free to those who qualify and are specific to the person not the vehicle. Permit holder must be the driver or a passenger in the vehicle for the Permit to be used. My guess as to the reason for allowing photo copies is it would be impossible to have the original permit in the parked car & also with the person who is away from the vehicle fishing."
