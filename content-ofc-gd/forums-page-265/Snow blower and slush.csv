My neighbor came over yesterday, his snow blower ran fine but when he engaged the auger it just made a grinding noise. Fortunatly he stopped as soon as he realized something was wrong. Turned out he had put it away without compleatly clearing all the slush from the impeller and it had frozen. I have seen them take the gear out of the differental when people do this and it is an expensive fix (the gear is worth anywhere from $60.00 to $80.00) so just make sure before you put your snow blower away that you make sure the impeller and auger are free of slush."

Great advice Cliff.I run the auger out of the snow all the way to the shed.My trouble is the plastic shute with the gear and pinion.Must pour hot water on both to avoid breaking a cotter pin."
