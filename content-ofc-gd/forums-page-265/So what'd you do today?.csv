825271,ch312,2013-12-19 18:22:00,1590,I wonder how much the rescuee was billed to cover the rescue?
825343,Richie Razor,2013-12-20 01:07:00,536,Are you guys not reading the 2nd post? Kickingfrog was not the guy out there on the crane being rescued..... Lol
824860,kickingfrog,2013-12-17 21:21:00,8333,No big deal just went to work on a construction crane and then had a massive explosion and fire underneath me. I climbed out the end of the boom and waited for an hour while the flames went higher and then I was rescued by a helicopter.
824862,kickingfrog,2013-12-17 21:22:00,8333,Not me. I just picked up a sick 20 month old early from daycare.

824866,kickingfrog,2013-12-17 21:30:00,8333,I would think at this point most of the major tv news would have it.

824875,Fisherman,2013-12-17 22:38:00,7201,"Went to Hoffmans in Stayner this morning, loaded up on on smoked ham, beef rouladen, pepperettes and a bunch of other goodies.  Came home, off to the garage, mixed a litre of gas for the old auger,  3 primes, 2nd pull and it awoke from its off season slumber.  Not bad for a 20+ year old Jiffy."
824881,Rustic-Fisher,2013-12-17 23:05:00,826,Nice !!!!Amazing rescue by the SAR techs at CFB Trenton !!! Almost as good as firing up a 20 year old jiffy LOL.
