And lots of privacy but she needs her wifi A cottage would be ideal but a lodge will do. Any ideas on we could get away? I stayed for a few days at Talisman Resort and thought it was  cool but  I see it is in receivership / tax sale  , we really need this , thanks"
826115,SirCranksalot,2013-12-23 01:03:00,3291,There are usually lots of cottages for rent here in Wasaga in winter. Blue mtn is quite close for skiing and we have a provincial park in town that has plenty of space for walking or snowshoeing. ( or XC skiing)
