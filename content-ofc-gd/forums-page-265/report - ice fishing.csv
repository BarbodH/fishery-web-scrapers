825859,NAW,2013-12-22 02:37:00,4022,Nice!!!!!!
825862,Rod Caster,2013-12-22 02:50:00,5784,"Long drive, short report  It was a short, but good outing. Why didn't you mention anything about catching a pike? haha.  That walleye you're holding is a beast!"
825863,adolson,2013-12-22 02:53:00,783,"No pics, no proof, no pike."
825864,NAW,2013-12-22 02:55:00,4022,How did the sled run chad?
825866,Rod Caster,2013-12-22 03:02:00,5784,"Forward good...reverse is grindy. I'm happy with the sled but I'm worried about the reverse function in the chaincase. I gotta get that looked at soon.  The snow banks are tiny and fluffy right now, it's tough to load the sled back into the truck."

825925,limeyangler,2013-12-22 13:52:00,5204,Great outing guys. Come on Chad…put some effort in…just lift the sled back on the truck (says the man with the gimpy elbow)
825929,S.M.05,2013-12-22 13:59:00,145,Those are some nice bars of gold guys.
