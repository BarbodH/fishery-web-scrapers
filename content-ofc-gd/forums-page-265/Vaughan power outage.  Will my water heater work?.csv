826009,fisher,2013-12-22 19:29:00,451,Thinking about work tomorrow and if the how water tank will have hot water if the power stays off?   Anyone know.  It's a 13 year old house with a 5 year old gas water heater from direct energy.  Thanks
826014,Rattletrap2,2013-12-22 19:43:00,1652,"Depends on the model. If it is the old conventional type with a standing pilot, then it will still fire. If it is power vented with an ignition system and ventor motor...not so much!  In my case, I have the old style, but my water is pumped from a well. I'm out of luck! Also, if I shower in the basement, I would have no waste pump to pump it up to the septic. Screwed again!"
826015,Bill Shearer,2013-12-22 19:52:00,456,"Rattletrap has it right, if you can't see power wires going to anything, then you will be good to go. Bathroom might be cold though."
826020,Old Ironmaker,2013-12-22 20:10:00,8243,"Depending on how long the power has been out the water may be hot enough now to shower etc.. Do what you need to do in the AM now. Open a hot water tap, is it still hot or warm? If it's not hot it's not heating and will be colder tomorrow."

826035,fisher,2013-12-22 21:11:00,451,It's vented outside so likely I am screwed.  May have to shower and shave tonight. Thanks.
826040,mosquito,2013-12-22 21:28:00,111,"Go down and turn it up... if it comes on you are good, all water heaters are vented otherwise you would be putting CO2 and CO into our house.  Direct Energy....  ... they were at my house ONCE... never again, their prices are horrendous and the work they do... I have nothing nice to say and well my neighbour threw them out when they were working on his furnace a couple years ago."

Sponge bath..bah..just wiggle your way through the snowbank barebutt..be a man."
826108,flippin,2013-12-23 00:51:00,34,Really?  I was told by another member to be careful what I say! It has a Powervent therefore it requires hydo! If you had a conventional water heater you would be fine till it ran out!  !! Gas is Gas! Anyways tomorrow you will be fine1 Hydro will be back on! flip
826167,nancur373,2013-12-23 04:51:00,1211,My hot water was fine during about 30 hours of power outage. She's an old girl. 1989 gas fired.
826418,Steve,2013-12-24 07:13:00,2075,our hot water worked (gas fired) through our 47 hours without power.  we resorted to a few late night hot showers.
