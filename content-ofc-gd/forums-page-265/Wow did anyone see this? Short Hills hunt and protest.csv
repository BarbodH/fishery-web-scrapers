825285,ch312,2013-12-19 19:07:00,1590,"While deer are ""part of the landscape"", they are large animals and cause millions of dollars worth of property damage every year and cause thousands of accidents across North America, with some resulting in people dying. Hunting is the cheapest and likely most effective method of lowering the deer populations, even if it's conducted within city limits where it's 100% legal. In the video they mentioned they've tried miles of fencing and it doesn't work to keep the deer out and controlling deer populations, which are devastating the gardens and trees by the sounds of it, is the only answer. It is the Royal Botanical Gardens, not Royal Whitetail Deer Refuge   As for that guys comments, I think he considers the deer his pets and is unaware that deer have been known to run up to 100 yards before expiring, even with a double lung or heart shot from an arrow or slug.    The only thing that I dislike about these culls is that it's only open to natives and not all hunters. To make thing's fair they should have a draw system which allows people from any ethnic background to participate"

We have a protected area on the west side of the escarpment.  walking trails, mountain biking trails, etc.  I started mountain biking these trails in about 1990 (10 years old).  We would see nice deer (big ones too) when we rode.  It was a beautiful area.  I need to clarify this is DIRECTLY in city limits (I mean, back yards backing directly onto the property, with homes surrounding the entire property). Its not an ""edge"" or anything like that.  about four years ago some neighbours started seeing blood on the trails. Thinking the worst they called the cops. Cops set up a watch and found natives going in at night and using crossbows, shooting deer.  this was rather alarming, as this had never been done before, native, non native, or the alike.  so the natives were told you are directly in city limits, stop it.  of course the next thing that happened is we had bands from all over the area protesting their right to hunt this land.

If there is to be hunting on adjacent and/or city limits property, then full communication, debate and rules need to be written...for everyones sake.

Hunting within city limits is 100% legal according to the MNR and it is up to each municipality to set their own bylaws if firearms and bows can or cannot be used within city limits. That said, Hamilton does allow the use of firearms and bows for hunting within the city limits providing the user is fully licensed, ensures their projectiles do not leave the property, and is more than 100 meters from any dwelling.  While I disagree with allowing only natives to participate, in this case they are permitted to hunt within city limits and the public was blocked from the park during the native hunt as people setting off fireworks would interfere with the hunt and cause problems.   Follow this link for detailed maps (the area you're describing is on one of the maps) and firearms related bylaws.  http://www.hamilton.ca/NR/rdonlyres/6B512F07-8535-4A14-AC46-D24735E4AD6F/0/05114.pdf   "

You would need to obtain written permission from the landowner (City of Hamilton I guess?) in order to legally hunt the area, something I doubt would happen.  Why not fire off an email seeking permission to hunt the park and see what they say?"
820458,ch312,2013-11-26 17:24:00,1590,"Nice bit of constructive information there CH132 thanks for your insight  Just trying to educate everyone as it's a very common misconception that hunting within city limits is prohibited everywhere when in fact it is up to each municipality to set their own bylaws.  Unfortunately, Brantford does not allow the discharge of firearms or bows within city limits except at approved ranges."
820461,ch312,2013-11-26 17:39:00,1590,"Another interesting link and survey for the area discussed.  http://www.animalalliance.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/AncasterWinteringDeerSurvey2009FinalMarch11-2010.pdf   It turns out that this 2009 winter survey found that the area where this hunt occurred has the highest deer concentration in the area with 1.21 deer per hectare. 1 deer per hectare = 100 deer per square kilometer so this survey found that the area where this hunt occurred had a deer density of 121 deer per square kilometer!  That's a ridiculous amount of deer (unhealthy for the herd) and it was likely the result of this survey that justified allowing the hunt. Why bother using taxpayer dollars to fund a cull when natives can reduce the population for free?   While it's not fair that only natives were allowed to hunt, it was a cheap and easy fix to reduce deer numbers to better the herd."

""My property backs onto the KILLING ZONE I have lived here for over 40 years The deer are part of the landscape in my garden I am able to identify many of the individuals by their antler shape their colour and by their habits. Last spring One of the “ladies” had her twins up close to the house and she allowed me to film it. Around this time last year another of “the ladies” came here to die she was SHOT I was able to track her back to where she was shot. If I could track her (I am almost 70) the Hunter could have tracked her and put her out of her misery. The RBG will never see another penny of support from me any any others I can influence""  Yes, some sensationalism, but unless you are a hardened hunter I'm quite sure none of us want a dying animal coming to our property to die cause the hunter wasn't responsible enough to finish off their job."
