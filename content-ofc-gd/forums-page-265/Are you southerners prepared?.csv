826061,Beans,2013-12-22 22:26:00,3339,Thanks Cliff...Here is the latest: 
826064,aplumma,2013-12-22 22:37:00,6896,If you are going to be without power and the temperatures in the house could reach freezing don't forget to winterize your house. Turn off the main water and open all of the faucets both hot and cold. If you have a drain valve or bleed on the main water valve open that also. Turn off the breaker to the water heater you can drain the heater if you want it is not likely to freeze over a day or two.. Flush the toilets and then add antifreeze to the tank and the bowls as well as the traps in the sinks. Finally dump a little in the dishwasher and the washer machine. This should try to keep you from having frozen pipes and slit pipes. If you have a question feel free to P.M. me I will answer them as quickly as I can.   Art
826072,Entropy,2013-12-22 22:50:00,747,good point ART

825937,Roy,2013-12-22 14:30:00,13728,Active Outages: 485 Affected Customers: 99216  Most are along the Lake Ontario shores down as far as Brockville. Not much around your place Lew....closest is probably Roseneath with 20 or so powerless households. Hydro One reports are upgraded every 15 minutes. Most existing outages are scheduled to be restored later this morning. A very few of them won't be restored before tomorrow.
825940,lew,2013-12-22 14:39:00,12766,You two sound like a mortician trying to drum up business. lol  I just want to be able to justify spending all that money Art
825941,Big Cliff,2013-12-22 14:44:00,6899,"That is only hydro one customers Roy. There are a lot of areas ie Toronto, Milton, etc that are not shown on the hydro one site.  Parts of Lindsay were/are without power and that is just within the last hour. As of 5:30 this morning the weather network was showing 135,000 without power at that point, hydro one only listed about 50,000. We are getting heavy freezing rain here right now, I have a feeling the worst is yet to come."

825955,G.mech,2013-12-22 15:45:00,830," I just want to be able to justify spending all that money Art  I put an automatic unit in about 10 years ago and every time it runs I am sooooooo thankful I have it.  My wife thought I was an idiot when I installed it but now she is all for it as well.  It doesn't run everything in the house but all the critical stuff is running (sump pumps, water pump, water heater, a few lights and outlets, beer fridge in the garage, fish freezer,  big screen, etc).  Be patient, someday you will be thankful too.  The ice in Norfolk county is building rapidly and it's still coming down quite hard here.  Gonna be a big mess if it keeps up much longer.  Everybody stay safe, we don't need any more broken legs before Christmas."

I have been sick and unable to test it out and repair the last while. Thankfully, my neighbour was able to borrow a generator and I could also plug my sump pump into it. Once I was in the clear, the power came back on.  I have a few branches down on the property but no real damage.  I better get that generator going and back to monthly starts."

825974,irishfield,2013-12-22 17:13:00,26272,Got a hose you can hook to the hot water tap at the washing machine Shayne and spray the limb ends and melt some ice off?

825981,Woodsman,2013-12-22 17:58:00,1286,Our power went out from about 10 am to noon today. Lots of limbs down around town but ice is melting off the trees now.

Saves me getting hit by dead heads when the tree falls the conventional way in the forest!  We've still got power up here... but the almost invisible rain is really starting to be visible on the trees so who knows for how long. Oh well.. like I said in another thread... I go to bed at night and I get up in the morning.. but of course I can do that because I have a generator, three fireplaces in the house, a wood stove in the workshop, two tractors (one with a bucket and hoe), two chainsaws and a hydraulic splitter... oh and 500 gallons of AV gas and 300 gallons (700 if I include the furnace tanks) of diesel on site."

Just spent 2 1/2 hours out there with the snow blower and shovel, as I put the snow blower away the freezing rain started again.

826049,Entropy,2013-12-22 21:58:00,747,"Toronto Hydro crews assessing damage and responding to emergency calls, asking customers to 'share the power'    TORONTO, Dec. 22, 2013 /CNW/ - Toronto Hydro-Electric System (Toronto Hydro) is reporting that over 250,000 customers are without power across the city as a result of the ice storm.  Areas with overhead power lines are the hardest hit: Etobicoke, North York and Scarborough. Toronto Hydro is concerned that wind gusts and further adverse weather will hamper the restoration efforts.   As a result of the volume of calls that continue to come in, and the current weather conditions, Toronto Hydro is asking customers to prepare for the worst-case scenario. While the utility hopes to have everyone restored by Wednesday, it is asking customers to make alternate arrangements, if possible.   There are a number of customers who may have special needs or are elderly; Toronto Hydro asks that residents check on their neighbours.   For customers with electricity service, Toronto Hydro is asking that they ""share the power"" and consider inviting neighbours inside.   The City of Toronto has also opened a number of warming stations, they can be found at www.toronto.ca   Toronto Hydro crews are working to on public safety calls first, then on to restore priority customers such as hospitals, city services and TTC.  All available resources have been deployed and crews are working as quickly as possible to restore power."
