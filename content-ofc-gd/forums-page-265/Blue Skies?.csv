825870,fishnsled,2013-12-22 03:08:00,3520,Been getting brown outs in the Durham region but no light show....other then the lights going dim...pretty boring.  lol.
825871,Terry,2013-12-22 03:08:00,14456,Paul quit doing blue angels..........lol   it can be lightning
825873,4x4bassin,2013-12-22 03:11:00,1025,I just seen on the news that there is a lot of transformer problems/fires(not surprised) north of Toronto Joey . You are lucky you still have power if you are seeing this in your area ! Just snow so far around my neck of the woods .
825874,Joey,2013-12-22 03:14:00,9122,"LOL Terry.  Well it just did not look like regular lightening, and it stayed bright for longer than lightening does.  It does look very dark over that area so I'm thinking transformer.  I just went and got a few flashlights and lit a few candles just in case.  Everything here is Covered in ice and it has been freezing rain all afternoon."
825879,Entropy,2013-12-22 03:33:00,747,"I just heard about this on 680am, they said it was arcing with the lines.  Didn't explain it much, something about the lines being weighed down.  Entropy"

825882,irishfield,2013-12-22 03:44:00,26272,Apparently the power is out on Yonge St in RH Hun... high voltage lines arcing makes much sense as to what you are seeing. Snowing up here... had ice this morning.
825884,woodenboater,2013-12-22 03:56:00,2277,"yeah, friends in RH are watching a great light show from their upper floor condo, lots of transformers blowing up north of Toronto. We still have power but am reading on Twitter that many friends have gone dark."
825943,EC1,2013-12-22 14:49:00,930,"Was watching that lightshow on my drive down the 404 yesterday night as well! Kept thinking that I've never seen green lightning before! The trees are all getting very droopy, so hopefully they get to thaw out or we're probably going to lose a lot of trees in the next little while."
