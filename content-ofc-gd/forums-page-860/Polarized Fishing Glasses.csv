333664,Beans,2009-04-22 21:47:00,3339," You are absolutly right my friend...stopped by Mark's Worm Warehouse for some 1 3/4 inch Fin S shads and some 1/16 ounce lunker jigs and Mark had a bunch of the ""Fitovers"" for $19.99 Got me a pair of them...a bit tight going on (prob loosen up in time) but very comfortable to wear and what a difference !!!  Dropped by the new Kawartha Lakes Outdoors store in town and met Paul Clark and his dad (I think it was his dad)...They didn't have exactly what I wanted but they do have a good selection of stuff...If anybody is in Bobcaygeon and want to check them out they are in the back of the building where McDoos restaurant is opposite the Municipal parking lot...  My bro-in-law (uncle Dave) is coming here Friday for a few days of crappie fishing (got any venison pepperettes Meely? Or were they Joe's?)...we will both have a look at both stores then...He loves to buy real ugly lookin' lures...  ...you should see the apartment size tackle boxes he lugs around...full of Ugly Lures"
333798,dsn,2009-04-23 01:48:00,1018,I also need corrective eye wear while fishing too. What I used to do was go buy a regular pair of polarized sunglasses from BPS and take it to my optometrist and ask him to come of with the lens to fit frame ( cut shape of the lens to fit). You'd be surprised how cheap that was... it's usually the frame that costs the big bucks.  My optometrist sold frames but I pointed out to him none of the frames blocked light from coming in through the sides. So he spoke to the lab techs and they made it happen !!! Just tell them you need a pair of frames that blocks the light from coming in through the side of the face.  If you decided to try this route check the thickness of your lenses around the bottom. If it's thick you might have to choose a thicker frame. If not then your ok with a narrower frame cause this is what's going to hold your lens. I think BPS has cheap fishing sunglasses on sale for $6 bucks I picked up two. Cause I'll be updating my presciption soon as well.  One thing they pointed out... the sunglasses that have a single panel that blocks the light on the side of the frame is better than the wrap around ones when it comes to prescriptions. Cause when they do the wrap around with a prescription lens you might get distortions looking through the side of the lens. Can make you dizzy after a while.  And don't worry if the frame doesn't have sqrews to put the lenses in the frame. They melted my frame and put the frame back to its original shape with the prescription polarized lens in it flawlessly. Truely amazing !!

333980,Markystang,2009-04-23 16:45:00,131,"I had a pair of the Cocoons(til I left them on the bumper of my truck and drove off  ). They were great imo. After a full day of wearing them, they tended to get heavy on my face and hurt the backs of my ears, but it's to be expected when wearing 2 pairs of glasses... Other than wearing regular polarized glasses with contact lenses, it's the only way to go as far as I'm concerned."
333986,Bernie,2009-04-23 16:56:00,3190,I can't justify spending a lot on sunglasses. Too easy to lose or damage in most of my boating situations. Had an expensive set fall off the console while under way and promptly blew out the back of the boat.

I have been looking at sun glasses that go over my glasses on the BPS site. Just wondering if getting these would be a good idea, there are good reviews on the site but I wanted to see if I could get a bit more re insurance on this issue...also $$ is a factor so prescription polarized sun glasses is not a option at this time  These glasses i have been looking at are called Cocoons Over-Glasses Sun Glasses.

329505,bigugli,2009-04-13 12:36:00,6138,"I have a pair of wrap arounds to put over my glasses. They aren't bad, but not as good a lens as my old prescription shades. One drawback when driving. There is a blind spot on either side  of the frames so you have to turn your head to the side more to check your blind spot. New script shades are out of my league as well. I paid $200 20years back. I was quoted $600+ last fall. The scripted polarized were very good and far more durable than most sunglasses on the market."
329509,JFR,2009-04-13 12:41:00,498,My wife has a pair and she says  they are great.  We picked hers up at the eye care centre in the Wally World store. I know they weren't as expensive as the one's at BPS.  John
329512,Great Lake Steel,2009-04-13 12:49:00,41,I had a pair of custom polarized clip ons made and couldn't be happier. I can still use them if I change my prescription they work great and hug the frames so I have the same fov as i'm used to!
329516,Beans,2009-04-13 13:09:00,3339,I have been tempted to order a pair of those over your glasses frames I saw advertised on TV for $29.95 plus S&H...You get a bonus clip to hang them on your sun visor...and a second pair for night driving...  It would cost me more than the price in gas to drive to BPS...  Unfortunately I didn't get the phone number...anyone ?

If you have an old pair of glasses lying around, you should be able to get polarized perscription lenses in them relatively cheap."

Recently was at the Cottage Life show and came across sunglasses, polarized with a 2.00 bifocal. $20.00 each and I got 2 pair, they are very clear and cut the glare. The placement of the corrective lens isn't a problem."
329579,Raf,2009-04-13 16:52:00,3495,are contacts not an option? that way you can use non-prescription polarized glasses.

329652,SBCregal,2009-04-13 21:34:00,688,"i bought a pair of cocoons last summer.  i was looking for something to wear over my glasses as well, tried on several cheaper pairs but i found the cocoons were the only ones that felt comfortable and didnt feel like they were about to fall off of my head.  they're great.  they are a little bulkier than normal sunglasses but nothing thats too big.  my plan was to keep them for just fishing but i wear them all the time now.  the arms/frame are a softer feeling rubber than most of the fitover glasses i saw and the arms are flexible and hold their shape so you can adjust the glasses to your face.  i'd recommend them 100%  after i got mine my father and mother both went out and got a pair...and my gf wants me to take her to get some too.  i was going to get mine at bass pro  but i found that lebaron had them cheaper...by about 10 bucks. when i got there they were on sale too so i got mine for just under 30 bucks i think  (basspro was 44.99 at the time)   hope this helps  ryan   just saw the post that mentioned bigger blind spots.... the cocoons have the small lens on the side by the temple area so the blindspots arent quite as big, they dont seem like you're looking down a tunnel."
329775,Radnine,2009-04-14 00:44:00,1538,I got a pair of polarized prescription Ray Bans this time around. I am hoping that they work well on the water. What I find when I wear them though is that my eyes sort of sting. I am not sure if it is whatever they put on them to polarize them or what (or it's just my imagination). Jim
329926,Seaweed,2009-04-14 12:37:00,135,Hi  My 2cents on this issue.  I have worn glasses all my life.  Spent many years fishing without polarized shades. I love these glasses.  They have totally changed the way I fish.  Fitovers Sunglasses  I find these fit way better over glasses then Cocoons do.  No I'm not sponsored by them either.
329935,mdej,2009-04-14 13:21:00,98,I'm with Seaweed.  I use fitovers as well.  I have 3 pairs.  One in the boat and one in the truck and car.  I think that you can get them for like 20-25$ at lebarons and in person at BassPro.  I use the large size.  After a long day on the water they can get uncomfortable on the nose but thats a compromise I'm willing to make for convenience and cost.  I don't think they work as well as real polarized len's in higher end products.  But when you wear glasses these are a great choice.
330033,hotrod,2009-04-14 19:10:00,103,Dad has the same issue and he's been wearing the fitovers for years.
330047,bigfish1965,2009-04-14 20:05:00,3382,"The danger with wearing prescription sunglasses is eye damage. I kept getting headaches from my clip on polarized lenses and asked my optometrist why. Modern lens styles tend to be very small. Putting a sun blocking device over just the lens causes the iris to open more. However the light coming in from the top, sides and bottom is still very much unfiltered...you get your iris opening and closing several times per second and are allowing alot of ultra-violet light into your eye. Wear the big ugly wrap arounds to make sure you protect your eyes and minimize ultra violet exposure,"
330064,dave524,2009-04-14 20:55:00,4508,"I have been wearing Aspex Eyewear Easy Clips for probably 6 years now. I think my last set of frames were under a $100 including the polarized clip-ons.  These are not your normal clips , the accessory sunglass lens fits extremely close to the perscription lens so that you or others are not aware that they are not just sunglasses.  This closeness causes the only downside in that if a drop of sweat from your brow gets into the tight space between the lenses if spreads to about the size of a quarter necessitating you dry them or suffer blurry vision in that eye , hope you  understand what I am meaning.   Check them out here, it is the best solution I have found for aging eyesight/polarized lenses.  http://www.aspexeyewear.com/"
330134,aws,2009-04-14 23:38:00,53,I got a pair for Christmas.  I love them.  They are a bit heavy - wearing two pair of glasses but the lenses are good quality and the frame is meant to cut out glare that comes from the sides.   There is also the drawback of wearing two pair of glasses with lessened ventilation on a hot humid day. You can get a cheaper pair from Walmart in the States I do not know if they are the same quality ( google fitovers and you will find cocoons and the walmart brand are made by the same company.  I inquired at walmart in Canada  they do not carry them).  Hope this helps
