332541,PBR COWBOY,2009-04-20 15:58:00,1,"Hey guys,  Never really went out to target perch before, but i got the boat all ready last weekend and well i hear its supposed to be sunny and 20+ all weekend.  I was thinking of headn to kawarthas possibly Stoney, what lake would you guys recommend for perch up that way???  Thanks!  Jonas"
332549,Ron,2009-04-20 16:11:00,1683,I wouldn't recommend any lake in the Kawarthas just yet as it isn't open until the 4th Saturday in April. All of zone 17 is closed to fishing with a few exceptions. Sure would be nice to get out on the water in this area though.
332554,Michael_Brown,2009-04-20 16:18:00,411,Hey Ron.  This Sat.is the 4 Sat. in April.  Stony might be a good choice. Not sure. I have heard Balsam is a good perch lake and I know Chemong lake has some decent fish. I would try sandy flats in 5 or 6 feet of water.  Good Luck.
332579,ecmilley,2009-04-20 18:06:00,2163,"lots of perch in all the lakes as for size think there all pretty similar, now if going for crappies, rice pigeon and scugog have lots a slabs swimmin around"
332667,ozaibak1,2009-04-20 20:50:00,401,"Have had good luck for perch on Stoney, hit up all the back-bays they are there in droves."
332671,Laker272,2009-04-20 20:57:00,45,"I would search out the crappie instead of the perch. Once your onto them, your on them good. Alot better fight then the perch IMO. Look for areas that the water warms up the fastest. Structure, cane, tribs."
332786,fishdawg,2009-04-21 00:13:00,912,"only once have i caught two 10"" + fish one day on the Kawarthas.... they just dont get big there.... or they are hidding in a spot i havent found...."
332789,mattyk,2009-04-21 00:19:00,2110,Simcoe has bigger perch.
333634,express168,2009-04-22 20:45:00,327," Yah, in the Musky and Bass!"
333890,Jer,2009-04-23 12:06:00,1426,"Once...and only once, about 8 or 9 years ago, we had a run of huge perch off of my dock for a day or two in early November. These were Simcoe class fish on Buckhorn like I've never seen before or since (besides the odd one off).  We've tried to duplicate every fall since and haven't been able. We had some freaky Indian summer weather that fall I remember."
333897,jeffw,2009-04-23 12:16:00,267,I've caught some big jumbos in sturgeon lake. Check out sheltered back bays with weeds or wood. Emily creek is another good areato fish.
