333353,BassAsin,2009-04-22 04:10:00,806,"So my girlfriends grandmother broke her hip this past Friday.  shes 62 and involved in her community more than anybody could imagine.  She raises money for minor sports is part of the royal purple, cooks such incredible food for bonspiels, banquets and many other events, she picks up garbage on her daily walk, and many other unselfish and greatly appreciated gestures. She is an amazing person who means so much to a community without ever asking for anything in return. having been diagnosed with diabetes a few years ago, recently having surgery to correct her glaucoma, having to make repeated trips to Toronto and now having broke her hip Friday outside of the high school going in to collect a donation for the united church, it seems as though the saying ""when it rains it pours"" has struck her with bad luck.  As the story turns out two young teenagers from the school assisted her in getting up and calling the ambulance. The school has asked for the two students to come forth as many thank you letters are awaiting them from friends, family and others of Helen.   The two young men have not come forth wishing to remain anonymous not wanting any praise or pats on the back from anybody, i guess it just goes to show that there are some people out there who are very thoughtful at heart and help make the world a better place.  Matt!"

333375,Nippissinger,2009-04-22 08:57:00,53,"Hey BassAsin, give granny our best and we pray she recovers fully. It is an unfortunate happening.  It is also very nice to hear our teens are not afraid to jump in and assist their fellow people in distress. A very heart warming story.  Nippers"
333376,lew,2009-04-22 09:01:00,12766,"Some people spend a lifetime seeking praise, others don't need it.  Sounds like your GF's grandmother, plus the 2 boys that helped her are all pretty good people and hopefully she has a speedy recovery.  She sounds like quite the lady."
333396,tinbanger,2009-04-22 11:35:00,1028,"Give our best to your grandmother .  She sounds like a great lady!  There are LOTS of great kids out there ,unfortunatly the few rotten apples get the headlines!  TB"
333540,xeon,2009-04-22 17:49:00,350," Haha no, there shouldnt be anything haunting about helping people."
333721,Leecher,2009-04-22 23:01:00,7832,Sorry to hear about this awful accident Matt Sound like she's one very special person in her community.... Wishing her a speedy recovery Jacques
333761,Rizzo,2009-04-23 00:34:00,4754,"here's wishing your grandmother a speedy recovery, it sounds like she will be missed while she is recovering. As far as the 2 helpers remaining anonymous I would do the same.  They were just doing what you would expect of anyone who would come upon a person in distress. The truly sad part is that there are many who would not do what you would expect! I guess that's why in today's society we are surprised when someone actually does something nice. Good for them for helping, and I agree with their decision to remain anonymous."
333766,solopaddler,2009-04-23 00:49:00,8605,Great story!

(the patients)  followed by "" actually who the hell is gonna bring me  lunch?"" hhaha she's smiling and lookin up hoping to be home in a few days.  Matt!"
