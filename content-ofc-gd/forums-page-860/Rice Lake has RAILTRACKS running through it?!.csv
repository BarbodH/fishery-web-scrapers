334255,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-24 06:02:00,270,Friday ! thunderstorms....hmmmm Well I will leave it up to my fishing friend nippissinger but still going to give it a whirl.....yes too windy everyone stay home the Lake is all MINE brouhaha!
334256,rbaquial,2009-04-24 06:05:00,968,"Well, being my Father-In-Law is dying to go out fishing - and the likelyhood of us NOT going fishing on the boat - would u guys advise just stay close to shore and fish the bays NEAR Bewdley? (stupid question, I know - but I wanted to ask)"
334259,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-24 08:55:00,270,Dude if your not renting a boat and want to find some good spots there are a few government docks in the area I heard are good to fish from !   http://www.thefishinguide.com/rice.shtml   found this amazing website ..I heard GoresLanding is a good spot .  
333858,rbaquial,2009-04-23 05:10:00,968,"Hey OFC'ers,  So, I was doing a search online for this ""Infamous"" Rail Tracks that run through Rice Lake. I still haven't found where it is... but I'm still searching....I think I might have it narrowed down... but I want to confirm on other sites (or through someone here on OFC). PM me if you'd like to share with me where they are...Like I said, I think I might have narrowed it down... but I need to get confirmations...Besides, we're renting a boat and I don't want to waste time riding the boat, when I could be fishing, ya know? Can anyone kindly point out WHERE I can find these ""tracks"" that run through it? I remember seeing it on a map once before....  Anyway, I came across  THIS ARTICLE  from another fishing forum on  THEE STRANGEST  thing ever used to fish...read the bottom article. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS?! Hahahaha... I find this IMPOSSIBLE!! I mean.... how did someone ""accidently"" come across this discovery...""Hmm, I tried all my lures....oh! here's that C _ _ A M that my wife was looking for.... oh well, lets try it out!......BAM!! FISH ON!!""  Anyway, just 2 things I thought I'd share and ask...  Thanks, Rob"
333864,adempsey,2009-04-23 06:49:00,1498,There used to be a rail line going across the lake from back in the day (1850's) when everything was constructed in straight lines.   It runs through Tic island (formerly Ticket island).  It was built to connect Cobourg to Peterborough.  Head toward Tic island and you will see the marker buoys where you supposed to pass through to avoid the sunken railway.  http://www.harwoodmuseum.ca/railway3.htm
333865,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-23 06:50:00,270,guy above beat me to it oh well  !
333877,Terry,2009-04-23 10:08:00,14456,it's like 12 km from bewdly you can head for marker buoy T429
333899,Stoty,2009-04-23 12:24:00,2910,"They are about half way up the lake, extending from Tic island west to the Indian reserve (on the other side of the lake). If you're renting a boat from Bewdley, you dont have to worry about them, because I doubt your going to make a 2 hour run up the lake in a rental boat."
333902,Stoty,2009-04-23 12:30:00,2910,Here is where they are.  The red line is the tracks...the blue are the ONLY safe places to cross (between the markers)   
333918,Garnet,2009-04-23 13:03:00,2056,Rice is pretty friendly if run out of Beweldy  pass the first island's the lake will open up. On the north side there is a white church with a steeple to the south you will see a resort with Orange roofs this is you're  warning.  No amount of time savings is worth not going to the markers.  Starting on the north side right at shoreline there are markers buoys.   In the middle of the lake traveling either east or west aim for the second Island you come to the buoy's.  Tick on north side right at shore there are buoys.  Now 2/3 from Tick to south shore there is un marked pass threw go slow it's about 8ft wide and 1 boat at a time.  Garnet
333920,aniceguy,2009-04-23 13:07:00,1094,having been the recipiant of finding the tracks unwillingly make sure you do find the channel and stay in it
333928,Stoty,2009-04-23 13:45:00,2910," HIGHLY discourage a person new to the lake to use this....WAY too risky. Take the extra 2 mins, and go to the bouys on tick island."
333930,diggyj,2009-04-23 14:03:00,548,TICK ISLAND
333957,Garnet,2009-04-23 15:32:00,2056,I didn't really mean slow. Get on your strolling motor and fish way threw.  Garnet
333987,Hooked,2009-04-23 16:56:00,891,"  If you plan on fishing their, definately don't rent a boat from Bewdley, like Stoty said, it'll take you 2 hours to get there and by the time you get back, you'll have an empty tank.  Also check out alot of the coves by their on the north shore, just anchor and you'll catch virtually every variety of fish in that lake in one place.  Let us know how ya do, I'm heading up there in July and possibly a weekend in May."
334030,rbaquial,2009-04-23 19:42:00,968, Doh!    We did... Any idea how big of a motor they have on their boats? We're probably gonna work the in-land bays that are near Bewdley... I was thinking we wouldn't make it that far out with enough time to fish....
334032,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-23 19:46:00,270,  ask around Rob I'm sure you can get action around Bewdly for fishing!  It's a huge lake Im sure you'll be fine /
334038,Sinker,2009-04-23 19:56:00,8692,"You guys don't have to go far for crappies out of Bewdley. They're calling for a SW wind at 25km for saturday, that wind can whip up that lake pretty good. I wouldn't go too far in a rental. They're 14fters with 9.9's. Stick to the Bewdley area, you'll see all the boats fishing crappie on the north shore. Stick to that area. I would bring an extra length of rope to add to your anchor line, the ones supplied are too short for a wind like that. Nothing worse than finding fish, and not holding with your anchor.  Sinker"
334039,rbaquial,2009-04-23 19:58:00,968,"Yeah, I was going to ask around anyway - but I thought I would try and get an answer ahead of time.  Sinker - I think that's what we're gonna plan on doing anyway....stick around Bewdley for Crappies. I'm definitely going to bring some extra rope for the anchor.  Thanks everyone who helped me out!! I'll make a report when I come back - hopefully, I won't forget my camera!"
334043,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-23 20:01:00,270,don't forget your camera man
334050,MillerPhoto,2009-04-23 20:17:00,147,"Something neat when I went to google to look at the map satilite photo of the lake.. If you zoom in enough, the south end of the lakes photos have been updated with Winter! photos.. so you can see what half the lake looks like frozen!   "
334065,Stoty,2009-04-23 20:56:00,2910," Haha, yes I noticed that, hence why I zoomed out a bit for the view! Didnt want to confuse anyone!"
334067,misfish,2009-04-23 21:02:00,29133,"With the right amount of speed and trim,U CAN DO IT.LOL J/K  Follow the markers."
334095,JeffBornFishin,2009-04-23 22:34:00,260,"It is very difficult not to see where the tracks are.  A friendly reminder unless you have detailed local knowledge of the water you are on you must have a current edition of the Small-Craft Nautical Charts for the water you are on.  Now I have been going to Rice since i was 5 years old.  Guess what...still got with a chart  Two years ago a guy I know that used to dock at our marina ventured out to Rice with the wife and kids.  Hit the rocks/tracks at 40 mph and destroyed the boat.  His wife and kids are now terrified and dont want to go out in the ""new"" boat.  Always be safe and prepared.  Conditions change very fast there with the winds.  Be prepared to get off the water quickly if need be."
334154,mikeh,2009-04-24 00:27:00,824,"One tip I can give about Rice or any lake is to check the wind direction and velocity the day before and plan your day, for instance it says 30 km sw on sat and sun which is pretty substantial on Rice, I've seen it get pretty choppy when the wind blows the length of the lake. I'd probably fish close to Bewdley or the south shoreline or around the islands looking for weed beds."
334239,Hooked,2009-04-24 04:15:00,891,"The good thing about Rice, pretty much all shorelines contain all sorts of fish.  It's a panfish factory there for sure.  If you can, just stay to the shore from where the wind is coming from, will cut down alot of the wind for ya's.  Good luck."
334242,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-24 04:59:00,270,who said anything about being Windy this Saturday ..its going to be calm warm and ooh yes full of fishies Cant wait to see all those reports!  Ps don't forget your cameras ( should be kept in the tackle box the night before ) lol
334254,Sinker,2009-04-24 05:53:00,8692,  These guys seem to think its going to be windy. Bad direction for Rice. I might cancel my plans to head out there if its that windy.  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/caon0151  Sinker
