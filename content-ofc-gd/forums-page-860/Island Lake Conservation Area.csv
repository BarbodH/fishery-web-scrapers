334111,MSBruno,2009-04-23 23:04:00,369,Been there in the past and only caught small bass and very small hammer handles ... been skunked a few times too.  Worth going back?  Any tips and tricks?
334117,jediangler,2009-04-23 23:17:00,1923,"Both pike and bass are closed right now so you should probably wait till those seasons open. There are perch and crappie in Island lake, but they are even harder to find. Small jigs and grubs or tubes under floats will work."
