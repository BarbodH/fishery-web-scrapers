333655,xionicz,2009-04-22 21:26:00,2,"First off I would like to say Hi to everyone here, as I just signed up to the forums.  With the season just about to open up for trout I would love to get out and try my luck with these great fish, specifically with the rainbows.  I was wondering if anyone here could direct me in some nice spots that I could try my luck at.  I am located in whitby, ontario aka Durham.  I would prefer something closer.  Thanks in advanced!"
333660,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-22 21:41:00,270,there are thousand of opportunities to fish for raindows  in and around you area! check google for rivers and lakes near you  http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source...=10&iwloc=A
333665,ADB,2009-04-22 21:47:00,444,"Welcome to the board, Xionicz.  Most people are not going to give you any exact spots on where to catch rainbows.  However, there are some of the more popular rivers near you.  Just west of you there's the Rouge River and Duffins Creek, and east of you there's Oshawa Creek, Bomanville, Wilmot, and the Ganaraska.  Again, hardly anyone will give you any exact spots, so the best thing you can do is to get out there and just fish.  Explore the tributaries I mentioned and see what you can do.  Good luck on opener."

333956,fishermccann,2009-04-23 15:29:00,655,"For your first time  I think Sat. morning may not be your best bet, could sour you on stream fishing for a while."
333958,BillM,2009-04-23 15:35:00,17367," Get ready for the chaos...  I'm hitting some small creeks/rivers Sat morning, everyone else can fight over the steelhead."

334064,justin elia,2009-04-23 20:54:00,151,"Durham region is a very popular area for anglers to target Rainbows.  Pick any river out there and there should be fish around.  Be prepared however to share the river with many other anglers.  Be curtious, kind and respectful.  Good luck.  J"
