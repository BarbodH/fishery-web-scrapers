333762,Bing,2009-04-23 00:43:00,33,"Hi guys thought I would do a little maintenance on my 9.9 Mercury fourstroke. I ordered a oil filter for it and not that I have it, I can't find where the oil filter even is LOL. Can anyone give me a hint.  Thanks,  Bing"
333765,irishfield,2009-04-23 00:49:00,26272,There isn't one.. how did you order a filter for it?
333775,Bing,2009-04-23 00:59:00,33,I read in the owner's manuel to replace the oil and oil filter every 100 hours or once a year. I called my local Mercury dealer and asked for a oil filter and gave him the serial number. They actually ordered one in and I have it. I can't find one on the motor. Boy do I feel stupid.
333786,irishfield,2009-04-23 01:11:00,26272,You shouldn't .. but the dealer sure should !!!!
333790,mbac31,2009-04-23 01:18:00,904,I think that you are talking about the Gas/Oil water seperator. Maybe?
333791,irishfield,2009-04-23 01:23:00,26272,No the manual does actually say to change the oil and filter every 100 hrs or once a year... there just isn't a filter. Same dialog in my 9.9 pro kicker manual.
333797,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-23 01:44:00,947,Weird could there be like a internal one sorta like a tube style oil filter you gotta take out of the engine.  Just a guess i know he said he gave the model number and all
333823,irishfield,2009-04-23 02:37:00,26272,Okay.. this one peaked my curiosity... apparently '95 to '02 use a filter like this    I also see listings for this filter for 8/9.9 and 15    .. but have no idea what year they go on. All I know is my  2007 doesn't have an oil filter... not one that I've found at least ! lol
333834,fishboy,2009-04-23 03:10:00,550,so do they just rely on the annual oil change to keep things clean?
333837,irishfield,2009-04-23 03:12:00,26272,Yep.. same as my 5 Hp Honda 4 Stroke.. no filter... no big deal if you do the annual change. We run 100/150/210/285 HP aircraft engines 50 hours or more between oil changes without filters in many cases.
333852,NANUK,2009-04-23 04:07:00,797," The top one is just an oil stainer, its a Yamaha power head, if thats the one in your motor and the screen is not damaged Just clean it with some solvent, dry and put it back. no need to replace."
333900,ecmilley,2009-04-23 12:25:00,2163,"my 9.9hp merc 4-stroke has an oil filter on the port side of the engine, it's a 2003 model year, it's also the same filter on yamaha snowmobiles and motorcycles the wix or fram number i just can't remember right now"
333976,irishfield,2009-04-23 16:28:00,26272,Well I had to go look again.. just to be sure all this aluminum dust hadn't really set into my brain... and nope there is no filter on my 2007 9.9 4 stroke pro kicker.
333977,ecmilley,2009-04-23 16:34:00,2163,weird wonder why they would have a filter on the 2003 and not the 2007
333978,irishfield,2009-04-23 16:36:00,26272,I don't know.. if yours is the screen type thing.. as has been said they were yamaha power heads.. from '95 to '02.. so maybe your '03 was an early production still using the screen?  When you say the port side of the engine.. under the cowling or on the side of the case.. maybe I have been into too much aluminum dust..
334056,ecmilley,2009-04-23 20:28:00,2163,"under the cowling toward the rear of the engine and it's a regular spin on oil filter, pretty sure this is a yamaha power head, it doesn't have a screen anywhere that i seen"
334106,irishfield,2009-04-23 22:55:00,26272,I looked again... and definitely no filter or screen.. Dug out the manual... no mention of a filter in it either. Shows how to drain and fill the oil... no filter install/#/info what so ever. Guess they determined it was a cost reduction they could make without reliability issues.
334297,Bing,2009-04-24 12:31:00,33,"Thanks for all of your replies guys, I guess I will bring the oil filter back. My 9.9 is a 2007 or 2008 and definetly no oil filter. All the maintenance is done now it is time to FISH."
