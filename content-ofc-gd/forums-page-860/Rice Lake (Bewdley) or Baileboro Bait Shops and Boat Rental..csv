Also, do they rent boats... if not... where can we rent one? OH!! Also... does a person without a ""BOAT LICENSE"" have to have one to rent a boat?  lastly, if you had a choice to fish either L. SIMCOE or RICE LAKE.... which would you choose, and why? (asking, because my father-in-law really wants to hook into some good sized fish)."
333340,rbaquial,2009-04-22 03:22:00,968,Anybody know of any baitshops in Baileboro or Bewdley.....near RICE LAKE?
333342,mikeh,2009-04-22 03:27:00,824,"right in Bewdley at the water there is a bait shop, for spring crappie I don't think you need minnows, just a slip float, a few micro tubes and maybe a white maribou jig with a pink head."
333345,EC1,2009-04-22 03:43:00,930,"Assuming you want crappie in quality, I'd go to Rice lake over simcoe any day. Crappie there are more common and average size I think is better than Simcoe's"

333433,rbaquial,2009-04-22 13:47:00,968,Thanks Hirk - I'm thinking that's where we'll more than likely end up going. I'm still checking out the other options (Buck's Boat Rentals & Rice Lake Boat Rentals)....So far BJ has the lead  Thanks Again Everyone!
