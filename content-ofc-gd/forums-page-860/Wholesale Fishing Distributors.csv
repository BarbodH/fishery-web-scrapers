There will be minimum orders $500, $1000. Redwing Tackle, Lucky Strike, and almost every company sell direct to retails.  The next level is KTL, Marrice, Perry's Tackle and dozens of guys rep. small amount of products.  The standard rule is everybody makes 100%.  So if your buddy has the cash on 30 days to get best prices he will make 200% by cutting out those middle guys.  Garnet"
