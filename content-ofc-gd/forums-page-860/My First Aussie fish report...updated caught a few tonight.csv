332925,Fudd,2009-04-21 09:06:00,94,"So we made our way to Killarney for some surf fishing. Weather was beautiful for this time of year and around 24 degrees. Headed out around 5pm with the hopes of some big salmon. Unforunately they were not around, the tiddlers were stealing our bait left and right. I finally hooked one about 12cm's i was to embarrassed to take a photo. I had 1 good strike for the 2hrs we were down there but snapped a few nice photos of the area.  some photos of the bait we use.. pipi's(clams) and Blue bait.    some shots of the area... the rock you see is a lava flow from a near by volcano          "
332927,solopaddler,2009-04-21 09:42:00,8605,Very nice pictures. I had no idea there were any salmon down under. Do they ascend any rivers?
332928,Fudd,2009-04-21 09:49:00,94," We actually have a healthy amount of Chinook, Rainbow, Brown, and atlantics. They are all stock and in the lakes. The salmon i was after are the Australian Ocean going ones. Pictured below.  Not me but a good pic of a salmon that i am targetting.  "
332938,solopaddler,2009-04-21 11:01:00,8605,"Cool looking fish, looks kind of like an amberjack. I'll guess ""salmon"" is a local name for them."
332941,Fudd,2009-04-21 11:12:00,94,"  That is there actual name here, Eastern Australian Salmon Arripis trutta (Forster, 1801). Australia has several Salmon native to the Southern hemisphere. They are not related to the North American variety."
332949,solopaddler,2009-04-21 11:48:00,8605," You made me check wickipedia   .  Very interesting fish indeed. Says early settlers called them ""salmon"" 'cause of their vague resemblance to the fish of their homeland. I guess the name stuck."
332951,Fudd,2009-04-21 11:53:00,94,"Yer, i think they are actually a member of the ocean perch family. Now to really confuse the matter, we also have Blue Salmon and king salmon(threadfin). They both look more like catfish. They confuse me even more, because they also have a thriving chinook and atlantic salmon fishery here... confused yet?. i am"

333019,Joey,2009-04-21 14:14:00,9122,Great pictures and that is very interesting about the names of the fish.  Wish our weather looked like that here today  Joey

333398,Fudd,2009-04-22 11:37:00,94,"Well went out again tonight and caught a few fish pictured below, also hooked in to a shark!!!!... Was about a 3ft Gummy shark, but i did not have my wire on and it eventually broke me off in the surf, last picture is me with the bugger on, sure puts a bend into my 14ft surf rod.  Typical Aussie Salmon, a bit on the small side but very good fun, they constantly jump and run.      "
