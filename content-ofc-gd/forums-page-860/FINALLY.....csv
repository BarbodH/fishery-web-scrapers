333350,Stoty,2009-04-22 04:01:00,2910, HA! I see you haven't lost your sense of humor eh Lois!
333368,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-22 07:28:00,270,sweat boat Stoty!
333369,RuNnYoOzE,2009-04-22 07:30:00,270,  I've heard only good things about Toyota trucks!  smart strong and the most fuel efficient.....great towing capacities !
333395,Billy Bob,2009-04-22 11:34:00,5865,Also with a 4X4 that sits up much higher you can see right over the boat when towing it. I really like that part as well as having all the power to go but also to STOP like the boat isn't there.....  Bob
333399,tinbanger,2009-04-22 11:38:00,1028,  for sure ! Some people seem to forget about the stopping part !  TB
333404,wolfmachine,2009-04-22 12:27:00,89,"i dont think those trucks are intended for towing. infact, they have stickers on them that say so"
333442,Zubris21,2009-04-22 14:25:00,563,Beauty boat Stoty.  Can't wait to see lots of reports!
333450,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-22 14:41:00,0, HUH?..  Not my fault you can't hear your motor running.  ........Where do the riggers or salties go on that rig? and No fish to show for your first time out?.....Hope that isnt an omen!....
333523,Stoty,2009-04-22 17:26:00,2910," My speedo goes up to 180 km/h...which it isnt intended to go that fast either... I like to live on the edge....   Riggers????? what are they There will be no such thing on my boat! lol  No rods in the boat, it was my first ride in her. This weekend on the other hand....."
333550,Guest gbfisher,2009-04-22 18:25:00,0,well..  ..the things you need in order to catch real fish.  .......... other than green carp.....  They're incidental don't ya know.... You should have bought a pleasure craft if you didnt want to fish...No rods.  .No excuse!....lol...
333726,Leecher,2009-04-22 23:07:00,7832,Great looking ride Stoty  Now go get it slimmed a little Leechman
333776,BUSTER,2009-04-23 01:01:00,1336,VERY NICE!  now go get that smell of skunk off it and get the fishy smell rockin!   looking forward to the reports.
333836,Ron,2009-04-23 03:11:00,1683,"Stoty!  Another home town boy! I actually think I know where that green garage door is toward the East end. I will have to drive down from Smurfsville to confirm, perhaps check out the skate board park. If that's the case, I'm only a few blocks away.  Cheers, Ron..."
333936,BillM,2009-04-23 14:25:00,17367,"  Oh geez, don't make me post my oldmans Duramax again  :)"
333939,Dara,2009-04-23 14:32:00,3052,"  You have an ""old man""?"
333941,diggyj,2009-04-23 14:40:00,548,Sweet ride...................  Dirk
333054,Stoty,2009-04-21 15:35:00,2910,"Since the weather was decent this past weekend, I decided to FINALLY get my new Ranger out for my first spin! Needless to say.....I'm in love!!!  Here are some snapshots!                  Can't wait to be able to fish out of it the next two weekends!!"
333057,2 tone z71,2009-04-21 15:37:00,1311,"well how she ride ,top end ,stability,looks purdy in the water"
333059,e-z-out,2009-04-21 15:40:00,1052,Looking good how is the towing with the extream?
333062,Stoty,2009-04-21 15:44:00,2910,"She rides pretty good!! Lake O, was pretty rough, caught some air, but she took it all in stride!  I opened it up about 80% inside the harbour though...got to about 42 mph. Top end will be around 50 mph ish.  Xtreme tows it no problem, lots of power. I'm looking to unload it, and get something 4x4 though, in case of bad ramps. Anyone interested in the truck?! lol"
333064,GBW,2009-04-21 15:50:00,8460,"looks like a nice ride for sure, congrats!"
333065,e-z-out,2009-04-21 15:51:00,1052,I use to have one and i never did tow anything with it. Going with a 4x4 is the only way to go your right for the bad ramps we tend to find. Good luck
333070,MCTFisher9120,2009-04-21 16:10:00,3761,"Sweet ride man, get somebody to get some photos of you hitting waves out there! Hope to see lot's of reports soon."
333072,ccmtcanada,2009-04-21 16:15:00,7971,Now that a sweet boat Stoty!!!  Congrats on a successful maiden voyage!
333074,BillM,2009-04-21 16:15:00,17367,"Stoty, nice boat man!!  Trade in the Xtreme for a ZR2   Should take care of any 4x4 issues you'll ever have, lol"
333083,The Urban Fisherman,2009-04-21 16:38:00,2050,"If I were in your shoes I'd have slimmed that boat weeks ago brother! haha (i'm talkin' fish slime by the way) Congrats dude, 50mph is fast enough for me, and you'll get some sweet mileage out of that 4 stroke yammy.  Cheers, UF"
333123,hotrod,2009-04-21 18:50:00,103,Nice looking boat and it must have been great to get out there. I just dropped mine off yesterday for a spring tuneup and then I'll be out there too. First pike tourny is May 3rd and I can't wait!
333130,cityfisher,2009-04-21 19:28:00,959,Sick ride! Congrats
333131,purekgw,2009-04-21 19:47:00,585,what would u sell the truck for?!?
333136,lew,2009-04-21 20:24:00,12766,The boat looks REALLY good Stoty and hopefully you'll get alot of great years out of it.  There's an answer to your PM waiting for you too.
333148,charlesn,2009-04-21 21:13:00,551,"Stoty,  Before you spend the money on 4x4 consider if you really need to do it.  It may sound hypocritical coming from someone who has owned 4 trucks - all with 4x4, but the 4x4 saved my butt maybe like once or twice in 13 years of trailering.  It's nice when the algae gets up on the ramp where the rear wheels are and on the rare occasion where you do some extreme launching, but with a bass boat, you're not likely to be going off-road and trailering in places that are not intended for launching a boat.  I can't remember a single instance last year where I ""needed"" 4x4 to get up the ramp.  Most times the truck stays in 2WD anyways.  If you can afford a new truck or want to match the truck colour to the boat, that's cool, but I'd recommend using the existing truck for a season and see how many times you feel it was even questionable as to whether you need 4x4 or not.  You can buy a lot of gas and baits for the cost of 4x4.  Great looking ride and enjoy the season.  There's nothing like that first legal bass in your very own rig.  Peace, Charles"
333152,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-04-21 21:22:00,1362,Super looking boat Stoty...the grin on your face says it all!!
333154,grt1,2009-04-21 21:28:00,638,"Well I hate to tellyou this but I think I can hook you up with a better deal. I got a 1975 starcraft bowrider with a 1985  100 hp merc on it and it ridesl like a dream, once you put in the one missing rivet and clean the pine needles out of the carpet.  I'll trade you even if you can deliver that lemon of yours to Red Lake, Heck I'll even give you a cruise a day tank of gas for your trouble, I don't think you would be upset with the deal since by the time you get the starcraft back down south you won't even notice the dents in the sideof it from the pounding against the dock.  Does this sound like I'm jealous, You're right!! great boat, you'll never get tired of driving it."
333160,mikeh,2009-04-21 21:36:00,824,"95 percent of the time I use 2wd to pull the boat out, there are a few ramps that require 4wd such as the ones around Waubaushene or if you try and launch off the beach in Frenchmans Bay. I've seen people get stuck there with 2wd minivans. good luck with the new boat."
333172,Billy Bob,2009-04-21 22:15:00,5865,"Here's your answer to your towing needs. This baby pulls my boat up, down and all around with out even knowing it's back there. Also GREAT for deer hunting...... "
333178,Stoty,2009-04-21 22:32:00,2910,It's not just the 4x4 that I'm thinking about....look how LOW my truck is as well.....  I needed a tractor to pull my truck out last summer with a 16ft aluminum on the back.......might be a little embarassing to have a Ranger on the back this year.....
333248,tinbanger,2009-04-22 00:41:00,1028,"nice boat , and that smile says it all.  Good to see the PDF as well  tb"
333286,Mike the Pike,2009-04-22 01:31:00,3421,Very nice lookin ride man.In all your pics with you in them you coudn't look happier it just needs some fish slime.
333301,aniceguy,2009-04-22 01:49:00,1094,  naw its a ranger guys will understand  glad to see it all worked out for you
333309,irishfield,2009-04-22 01:56:00,26272,Just take gbfisher with you Jamie... he has the truck going up the ramp before you can shut the motor off.. so you can push !
333325,Dara,2009-04-22 02:34:00,3052,"  I have one a them, and what you have behind it is exactly what I have to pull this weekend.  I got a deer with my Ford, nuthin with the Toyota yet"
