334151,tinbanger,2009-04-24 00:22:00,1028,"not sure when you are going and what you are targetting ?  Pike , I ususally have most luck in the central and east portions ( water 4-10 feet) lots of small fish with the 24 "" and up  Bass later in the year , do well along the far shore .  good luck  TB"
334165,goteeboy,2009-04-24 01:00:00,175,"from the launch to the other side of the lake the underwater contour is basically a 'W' shape.  from shore..shallow -getting deeper to about 15 ft and a hump at the center of the lake to 5 ft to about 12 feet and then shallows to shore. so i have the most success along any weed edge or along the weed flats, avoid all open water.  pike are ubiquitous."

334221,fishboy,2009-04-24 03:15:00,550, curious-where's the launch and what's the fee?
334224,Stoty,2009-04-24 03:29:00,2910,you can only access that lake by 1 road...there's two launches I believe.  $5 to launch...at least it was when I was there.
334228,Greencoachdog,2009-04-24 03:37:00,8163,  ... maybe I need to reread the initial post?... don't remember him saying he wanted to go for the Dinker Perchies...   ... but if that's what he's after... You Da Man Bubba!!!
