334171,ohhenrygsr,2009-04-24 01:11:00,947,why would you go from a 20Hp to a 5hp?
334172,Fisherman,2009-04-24 01:12:00,7201,"As long as the previous owner didn't use it as a cement mixer..   then all should be okay. Check compression by slowly pulling the starter through a complete cycle.  Maybe have the owner remove the sparkplug and check for oil fouling which may indicate ring or valve seal problems.  I just picked up a 1990's 8Hp, thanks to Big Cliffs manual, found the part numbers for the impeller, and carb gasket that needed replacing.  One pull and it runs like a ...Honda, no smoke or shaking."
334174,duckdog,2009-04-24 01:13:00,162,"Cause the boats rated for a 15hp and my 20hp that I kept off my old boat seems to be a bit heavy and I like the idea of a quiter motor, and I will be fishing mainly smaller lakes this year and I am curious"
334202,boatman,2009-04-24 02:15:00,350,"Its a fine motor. I have no first hand experience with them, but I understand they were good. I'd rather a Honda than a Mariner. However, its not much of a trade in my opinion. I'd hold out for at least an 8 hp. Or better, yet a nice Johnson/Evinrude 9.9/15 hp."
