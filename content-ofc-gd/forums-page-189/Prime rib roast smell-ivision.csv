899983,Freshtrax,2015-02-24 16:43:00,2215,Lol steaks.
900702,kickingfrog,2015-02-28 23:27:00,8333,A photo was taken of the Yorkshire:  
900704,lew,2015-02-28 23:30:00,12766,"They look good Rob, ALMOST as good as my wifes"
899582,kickingfrog,2015-02-22 18:14:00,8333,House is full of the aroma of rosemary and beefy goodness. It's time now for low and slow... and a skate in the front yard.  
899587,misfish,2015-02-22 19:01:00,29133,Very nice Rob.  I walked into the smell of a good hearty stew cooking away.
899593,lew,2015-02-22 19:37:00,12766,"Lookin good Rob, not much beats a good Prime Rib"
899600,Bill Shearer,2015-02-22 20:14:00,456,"Medium rare Prime Rib! Served with au jus gravy, and horse radish that clears the sinuses with every bite! Awesome! That roast looks delicious!"
899604,kickingfrog,2015-02-22 20:23:00,8333,And giant light as air Yorkshire pudding.
899605,lew,2015-02-22 20:27:00,12766,"And giant light as air Yorkshire pudding.  Sorry Rob, but my wife makes the absolute best Yorkshires in the entire universe LOL"
899608,misfish,2015-02-22 20:29:00,29133,And giant light as air Yorkshire pudding.  Oh stop it now.LOL  Im having duffs with my stew.
899610,lew,2015-02-22 20:30:00,12766,"   Im having duffs with my stew  If you were in the Navy Brian, duff would be desert."
899616,kickingfrog,2015-02-22 20:45:00,8333," Sorry Rob, but my wife makes the absolute best Yorkshires in the entire universe LOL Well, the only way to tell would be a home and home cook-off to see for sure. The only losers would be our belts."
899617,misfish,2015-02-22 20:46:00,29133," If you were in the Navy Brian, duff would be desert.  Im not sure about that Lew.  My late nan made these flour based light pillow dumping that just tasted so good when we would sup up the stew gravy.  I guess if you put some powder sugar on them,they would be desert."
899618,lew,2015-02-22 20:49:00,12766,"Well, the only way to tell would be a home and home cook-off to see for sure. The only losers would be our belts.  We had a similar thread here a few years back and just by coincidence it was a Sunday and my wife had Yorkshires cooking. When they came out I posted a picture and I think everyone here wanted one LOL  Your right though Rob, nobody loses when there's GOOD Yorkshires on the menu."
899619,lew,2015-02-22 20:51:00,12766," Im not sure about that Lew.  My late nan made these flour based light pillow dumping that just tasted so good when we would sup up the stew gravy.  I guess if you put some powder sugar on them,they would be desert.  I hear ya Brian and I'll bet your nan's dumplings were fantastic.  I was just referring to the fact that ""duff"" is navy slang for desert."
899626,manitoubass2,2015-02-22 21:25:00,11391,Now thats a MEAL!!!  Looks like it would be amazing KF
899652,Pikeslayer,2015-02-22 23:01:00,1443,Looks like you seared that sucker & let it rest before low & slow?  Yum yum.
899658,kickingfrog,2015-02-22 23:22:00,8333,Looks like you seared that sucker & let it rest before low & slow?  Yum yum. 450 for 30 minutes and then 275 until medium rare.   Edit to add that this was the last photo because things get hot and heavy near the end with the gravy and Yorkshires.
899675,Pikeslayer,2015-02-23 00:50:00,1443,PERFECT
899745,Mister G,2015-02-23 12:36:00,1429,Never heard of slow roasting a Standing Rib Roast.......but then again I do it in a charcoal grill.
899756,Headhunter,2015-02-23 13:54:00,5703,"That's good eats right there! That said, in the first pic, you have the roast up side down! Bones down and fat on top so that as it cooks, the juices run into the roast. HH"
899788,fish_fishburn,2015-02-23 17:46:00,1311,That looks awesome. Next time cook it with the cap facing up and bones down. Cooks better that way.
899819,kickingfrog,2015-02-23 20:08:00,8333,"That's good eats right there! That said, in the first pic, you have the roast up side down! Bones down and fat on top so that as it cooks, the juices run into the roast. HH  That was after the 30 minutes at 450 degrees. I pulled it out to flip it (take a photo) and turn down the oven."
899823,Headhunter,2015-02-23 20:47:00,5703,"I used to do the high heat blast to start the roast, but lately I prefer the low and slow method at 265 degrees. I found I was burning the spices on the outside of the roast with the high heat. HH"
899842,Bill Shearer,2015-02-23 22:44:00,456,"Can you explain the bed of celery/onions/carrots and what they are used for? Is it just for flavor of the gravy, and then discarded? Or do you blend it up for a base for leftover  stew?"
899860,kickingfrog,2015-02-23 23:34:00,8333,"Ya, the celery, carrots, garlic onions and extra rosemary are in the pan to flavour the sauce and get the roast up of the bottom of the pan. Although it's the chef's privilege to eat a few before the pan is deglazed with red wine."
899862,Mister G,2015-02-23 23:37:00,1429,"I also cook with ""wine"" but have never put any if the food....................LOL"
899878,Bill Shearer,2015-02-24 00:35:00,456,Thanks
