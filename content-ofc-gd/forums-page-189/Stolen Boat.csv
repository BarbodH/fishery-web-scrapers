901259,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-03 20:47:00,8243,"M2B2, well that makes at least one person that enjoy them.  Now that this thread has taken a 180 degree turn from where it started I will encourage all that are interested in knowing bit of history on what has transpired in Caledonia up to a few years back. Thinks have been quiet as of late. This past summer the northern portion of the land that is now under the ownership of the province had some activity. The properties of the residents that back on to the DCE were using some of the land to grow veggie gardens. Individuals that have taken control of this provincially owned land started erecting fencing so the locals could not use this to grow food. The only other thing that has happened is the Cayuga bridge on Hwy 3 that crosses the Grand River was 99% finished. The Haudnesasne (sic) group has stopped work on the bridge demanding many hundreds of thousands of dollars, or is it millions, from the Gov. as they say this area was never settled in the land claims a few hundred years ago.  Please try and read Christine Blanchfords book entitled "" Helpless, Caledonia's Nightmare of Fear and Anarchy and How the Law Failed All of Us."". $9.99 from Amazon.  I found it the least biased account of the goings on and most detailed account."

Contrary to popular belief ""natives"" are not paid with your tax dollars as many ignorantly believe.  Aboriginals are not any more entitled then anyone else, but they pursue what is legally owed to then by binding contract.  Many have mental health issues and substance abuse issues from the colonization and being forced into residential schools to ""kill the indian in the child"".  Do a little research.  My mother in law was raped and starved off and on by priests and nuns. She was deprived of her parents and culture for 13 years. She was routinely beaten and fed scraps.  In a court of law she was awarded 120,000 for her troubles. Sounds nice hey? Not really. She has horrible panic attacks, cant sleep etc.  Why? Good question for another topic"

We can put a man on the moon, stop terrorist before they get going, transplant hearts and otherwise re-build a man, then so we can put a stop to this non-sense. HOWEVER, you need pressure on the authorities so they want to stop these illegal acts in their tracts. Everything else then falls in place.

901228,Roe Bag,2015-03-03 18:24:00,246,"Lived in Caledonia for the past 27 years. Some of the nicest people I've met or dealt with are from the Reserve. People are people. Bad apples in every batch. During the Douglas Creek stand off, the real trouble makers were militants. Mostly from south of the border. They know they'd be shot if they pulled that crap in the US.  On another note, an area resident parked his truck at the Legion in Caledonia one night.  Went in for a few. Came out and started screaming that his truck had been stolen. Told the police he was on his way home from work when he stopped in. All of his equipment was in the truck. He embelished anything and everything he could in terms of contents for the theft report. He was a small time handyman/renovator.  He had his two sons steal it. The boys took the truck out onto the reserve and torched it. One of the boys had a problem with keeping his mouth shut. Was bragging to his friends about it in a local Timmy's. Turned out he was in close proximity to an off-duty police officer. BUSTED!  All parties involved were non-native.  All were convicted. Whole lot of insurance fraud going on. Especially in difficult times."

There is a lot of propaganda on the site; but read through that and it does show that there is two tiered law enforcement here in Ontario and the cops are afraid of acting.  Dan."

The Aluminum will be cut up and because thieves are stupid and greedy in most cases as are some scrap dealers They will scrap the Aluminum too. If the police really want to solve auto and marine thefts they should put the pressure on the buyer of obvious hot items. No market for getting rid of questionable items, no more getting rid of hot scrap. We were picking up a set of tires for buddy's Jeep a few years back and I eaves dropped the conversation between thief and scrap dealer. The thief has a truckload of a parted out Hummer, only the engine was missing , zero sign of an accident or fire. If a seller can't prove where he got it, no cash."
900813,irishfield,2015-03-01 21:34:00,26272,I doubt they'd scrap a 15' boat for the price of aluminum scrap... surely there's a camera somewhere on the QEW that picked this boat up heading for a restamp and resale.

You don't want to know how I know this but it involves two 20 ft Rangers with 225's. We kept two brand new sponsored Rangers in our yard behind a locked fence and gate with an alarm.They were in and out with both boats in under five minutes. Was called by the police two days later as they found both boats and trailers burned to a crisp in an abandoned gravel pit. 6 months later police pull over suspicious pick up and trailer on the 400 north with a lot of rec equipment on it, Everything on it was stolen including both of the 225 mercs from the boats, Guy didn't get charged with anything other than possesion of stolen goods over 5k. Now it just so happens that he was wanted on a murder warrent so no one needs to worry for a bit as he's locked away for a while."
900819,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-01 22:34:00,8243,"Not a bad ending to a bad story Musky+Specks  Irish, that would one dumb criminal to tow a boat down a heavily traveled highway in winter. There are many back roads from Binbrook. Talk about stopping a ""suspicious vehicle"". That would be more suspicious than a truck driving down a road and deemed to be ""suspicious"". What is and is not suspicious will be something we may be talking about soon considering Harpers new legislation giving authorities a broader range and a more liberal definition to stop anyone anytime because they look ""suspicious.""  As I said earlier criminals can be dumb and stupid. Like a successful drug dealer driving around in a inconspicuous Red Ferrari or Lambo rather than a 7 year old Volvo."

There is a local sheeny man (not a thief) that drives many K's to root through recycle boxes for empty booze bottles and any length of wire. He will strip wire and when he has enough for hours to get 5 bucks of copper. I tried to explain to him that he spends more on fuel than the meager money he comes out of The Beer Store or scrap yard with. He says he would be staring at 4 walls otherwise, he is 100% right.

No one knows what really was happening here  or can understand what it felt like unless they lived in Haldimand, even more so if they lived south of the river or close by the DCE. I gave my Mom the book Christine Blanchford wrote about DCE to read, she simply refused to believe a word of it. She said that could never happen in Canada.  The co worker of my wife had he almost new truck stolen from the parking lot of the Shoppers in Caledonia in broad daylight. The OPP looked at the very good security video. They told her point blank they are fairly sure they know exactly where the truck is and no local judge will ever give them a court order to search the property. Even if they turned over the case to the Six Nations police. They basically told her not to dwell on it, she will never see her truck again."

If I was quite sure it was a certain individual or group of individuals, I would contact the authorities immediately. Why don't you? I really don't like the profiling but hey, that's just my opinion. We live in a land of rainbows and unicorns up here in Canada. That boat could have been taken by anyone but lets not kid ourselves here. From smokes to assault rifles the Res carries all and there isn't a set of hard assed nuts in all levels of law enforcement and/or govt that would dare to do anything about it. Ask the Israelis how much worse things would be there if they didn't learn habits and tendencies of those who would want to exterminate them from existence. Just my opinion."
