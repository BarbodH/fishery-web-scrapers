But people will go into the malls, slide their hands down the handrails, then go eat lunch and think nothing of it, lol! You can justify anything with anything to make something sound less dramatic.  The simple point here is (and probably why this was posted), is that this business is sloppy and serving food to the public should be done so with respect and care.  The fact that they let this kid walk around barefoot is a clear indication that they don't really care about safety regulations and probably doesn't stop at bare feet in the kitchen."
901250,manitoubass2,2015-03-03 20:12:00,11391,So logical its funny???
901258,Steve,2015-03-03 20:46:00,2075,"Bill, I'll help you on that one...cause, you need it, lol.  To attempt to make your comparison somewhat logical and accurate, you would need to have a server, or food preparer, do that, then make someone's food afterward, without washing their hands, or wearing gloves.  you can scratch your balls, pick your nose, then pick your ass and eat your food directly afterwards.....just can't serve someone else food after doing it...  hope this helps clarify bills silly comparison."

901265,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-03 21:20:00,8243,"I delivered bread in the early 70's to restaurants in Hamilton for Roma. After seeing what I saw I would never set foot into some, as if I could afford it. When I could afford dining out it is not unusual for me to ask if I could peek into the kitchen. If they say of course I was good to order, if they say no, usually citing something about insurance I just leave. If it was a first date I would only go to a place I new the owners and staff. I have seen some very scary things in ""clean"" eateries. If the bathrooms were not spotless I guarantee you the kitchens reflected the same or worse conditions. The last restaurant my family took over had the skeletal remains of either huge rodents or small cats behind the equipment, ugly. Another quick way of determining a restaurants cleanliness is to take a look at their back door area where the garbage is kept. If the dumpster is overflowing and bags and boxes are strewn around on the ground I guarantee you rodents are not far away. Generally speaking chain restaurants are the cleanest because they must maintain franchise standards or loose their franchise which is very expensive."
901269,LostAnotherOne,2015-03-03 21:48:00,956,I worked in the pizza industry for a little over 5 years in my early twenties.  Work for both independent and franchise.  One thing I learned is to never buy pizza from a non franchised store.  Non franchised stores have no supervisors except the health inspectors that will make an appearance twice a year as opposed to franchised stores where they have company supervisors who are in and out of the stores on a weekly basis.
901270,SirCranksalot,2015-03-03 21:55:00,3291,"I read some of the Youtube comments. It's amazing(well, sad, actually that violation of food regs will bring on all sorts of ignorant racist comments."

901056,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-02 21:05:00,8243,"The health issue is simply having the kids dirty feet on the counter, the Safety aspect is a slip, trip and fall on the slippery ceramic floor covered in who knows what. All commercial kitchens in Ontario must have a floor surface that is constructed of a fire retardant and easily cleaned. I can know without looking that that floor is ceramic.  I can only read so many YouTube comments, full of trollers who's comments are only there to inflame.  I'm with Ketchinany. Only 2 places I will get Pizza and both are owned by family members."
901057,Fisherman,2015-03-02 21:08:00,7201,One reason we make our own.  :whistling: You make your own toe jam..
901068,leaf4,2015-03-02 21:49:00,2466,"Lol the one comment I loved, something along the lines of ""they hung up on me, all I asked for was a foot pizza with extra toe nail clippings"" I would die of laughter hearing that in person"
901069,irishfield,2015-03-02 21:52:00,26272,"Some just worry too much and have nothing better to do than post stuff like this on Youtube. The tales I could tell about some restaurants that I delivered milk to in my younger days, when I worked summers for Beatrice Foods... and we still ordered Chinese from at least one of the places I had to chase things out of the bag dispenser while changing bags and the pizza joint is still in town 35 years later as well!"
901073,Terry,2015-03-02 22:00:00,14456,I dont see the big deal here as long as they keep their hair nets and pants on. wash their hands after wiping their butts they can run around bare foot all they and their kids want
901074,leaf4,2015-03-02 22:09:00,2466,"Floors of restaurants in general aren't the cleanest places, I wouldn't want a child running about the place and climbing on stuff if I were ordering from there either"
901078,irishfield,2015-03-02 22:19:00,26272,"Just saw the added picture with the kid up there..... bare foot on the cutting table probably not a great thing, but then again when was it sanitized last anyhow! lol"
901079,Terry,2015-03-02 22:26:00,14456,ok that picture wasn't there before  that does make it a bit more of a health problem
901080,Steve,2015-03-02 22:41:00,2075,"ya, that's not good.  can't have that kind of stuff going down where you are selling food to the public.  at home? sure.  not selling food to the public."
