901413,S.M.05,2015-03-04 01:53:00,145,Nice to see the pics that go along with the tales of your latest northern adventures. With all that hiking around it looks like you'll be beating me in to those back lakes.
901418,solopaddler,2015-03-04 01:59:00,8605,"Cool report Bunk, enjoyed that."
901569,Moosebunk,2015-03-04 19:16:00,3970,"I guess Otter trail???  Missed that!  Think you're right (and Doug too) Weird spot for an otter to be, quite far off the river but, come to think of it I've seen much similar tracks to that and it spotted the otter to go with it.  That is one heck of a sleigh (the yellow one)! Me wantee!      Joe's didn't come with the wood rails.  If it had, he'd be the first to take 'em off.  It's about 8 feet long.  The Boggan I have is the Polar Plus.  They are lighter and more durable than the fiberglass Labradors, and the longer they are the less chance of flipping at higher speeds.  I was going to say Mr. Snuffleupagus dragging his trunk but figured I had a better chance with a sealion.  lol!   Always cool to come across something new in your adventures.  Cool report as always Bunk!!   Mr. Snuffleupagus... yeah, the Big Bird family often sees him roaming around.  Quiet elephant, bit of a hermit, chills with Bigfoot too.  With all that hiking around it looks like you'll be beating me in to those back lakes.  After a week home Mike... pretty well a couch potato again.  House of Cards has me glued to the toob too.   Thanks for the replies gentlemen."
901624,Bernie,2015-03-04 23:04:00,3190,Enjoyed that report Andrew. An interesting perspective. I work with many of the residents at the DeBeers mine and am getting to know some of them well. I am really enjoying learning their perspective on life and points of view. Many are shy until you take the time to sit down and have a quiet conversation. Have not yet made the trek to Attawapiskat on the ice road. But still a possibility this year. Apparently the ice road this year is the best one ever. Smooth and thick.
901647,bigbuck,2015-03-05 00:31:00,2449,Very cool. Definitely a life experience being up there in the winter.

But still a possibility this year.Apparently the ice road this year is the best one ever. Smooth and thick.  You're working with a nephew up there Bernie and a good friend of our family from Timmins.  The ice road is incredible this year, you're right.  In places walking it, I'd have to walk tight to the banks keeping one foot to the snow sometimes for a mile cause otherwise the whole road side to side was a sheet of slick glass waiting to slip me up.  Friend travels from Mattice to Attawapiskat in about 8-9 hours... that's a good quick tour through the forest and swamps, and saw many ice road truckers while out walking some days.  Always in convoy and everyone of them waves hello.  Would like to load up the snowmobile in the truck some year and do some fishing along that entire route.  Had my buddy and I had the time off together, was considering going about 60K up towards the mine by truck, offloading a sled and attempting to get some ice fishing in at an area I remember was good come spring for mostly walleye and pike, but, we didn't get time. It was freeeeeeking cold Jan and Feb so not too upset it didn't happen.  Anyways, good to hear you're enjoying yourself Bernie.  The quiet and shy with many people often changes to friendly, humorous and open.  Show any of the younger generation your skills if you can, there's always room for more experienced workers back in the communities."

901019,Tomcat,2015-03-02 17:44:00,395,Thanks for sharing Drew. Pictures of the owl in flight were indeed the prize.
901020,Cast-Away,2015-03-02 17:45:00,790,I love the owl pics!

901101,Sinker,2015-03-03 00:36:00,8692,Thanks for sharing your journey dood! See ya thursday! You can tell me all about it while I kick your butt in the big fish derby! HA!!  S.
901111,chris.brock,2015-03-03 01:29:00,4053,"Rugged country up there Bunk. Fishing is great but working up a sweat hiking, snowshoeing, or x- country skiing is good for the mind, body and soul.  You ever read Hap Wilson's books?  I guess Otter trail???"
901117,Rod Caster,2015-03-03 02:31:00,5784,"That is one heck of a sleigh (the yellow one)! Me wantee!  Not nearly on the same scale as you, but I spend a good bit of time in Fort Chipewyan in Northern Alberta over several years. There certainly is a similarity when it comes to small, isolated, delta northern communities; looking back, I'm also glad that I took the time to discover the community and be inspired by its natural surroundings, not so much the people, but my job required very little human contact... I just wish I had accepted that boat ride on Lake Athabasca. Enough digression, great read and photos, thanks for posting."
901123,sleepjigging,2015-03-03 03:52:00,207,Awesome
901124,Tim Mills,2015-03-03 03:58:00,476,Love the Owl shots and the guys at the bus stop
901130,Moosebunk,2015-03-03 04:29:00,3970,"Thanks gents!  Will try for some fish next time or maybe somewhere new.  The place I want to try and get to most for work is Pangirtung at the moment.  To hike the foothills and photograph Thor Peak and Mt. Odin and maybe catch some char inbetween shifts would be worth paying the employer for any work offered. lol.

I just wish I had accepted that boat ride on Lake Athabasca. Enough digression, great read and photos, thanks for posting.  Read a little about ""Fort Chip"" last fall on route to Athabasca and you did miss out with that boat ride.  You needed a rod too for that float.  With respects to small and isolated communities as well, often there is nothing much bigger and more inspiring than the outdoors which surround them.  You ever read Hap Wilson's books?  I guess Otter trail???  Oddly no Chris.  Even when we had one on hand to use his maps during a 2001 - 9/11 Temagami canoe trip, I didn't pay close enough attention.  Those will be collectors items some day wouldn't ya think?  Thanks for sharing your journey dood! See ya thursday! You can tell me all about it while I kick your butt in the big fish derby! HA!!S.  It'll be a great time and looking forward to it.  You can have all the big fish you want too... although my money would be on Lori, Brenda......... or maybe even WIG.  Great report Bunk!  Another beautiful part of the province that so few will ever see, thanks for sharing.  As for the track in the snow, I'd say beaver but that is just a guess.  Maybe a sealion?  Have no idea Will but likely not a sealion. lol.  Something dragging it's belly anyways.  Found lots of different tracks out there and couldn't tell ya what 90% of them were."
901142,Guidofisherman,2015-03-03 11:40:00,206,"What an enjoyable read. Loved how you turn the cold north winter into a a positive experience to be celebrated. While I'm a little one dimensional, I appreciate your diversity of out door experiences. Thanks for sharing."
901171,Moosebunk,2015-03-03 14:22:00,3970,Loved how you turn the cold north winter into a a positive experience to be celebrated.  That right there Al summarized the whole trek and post perfectly.  Celebrating the winter cold in the sunny south like you've been could be quite positive too.
