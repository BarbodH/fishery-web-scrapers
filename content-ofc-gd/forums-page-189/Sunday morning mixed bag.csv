Fishing has been good all year as far as I'm concerned  with alot more natural whitefish in good sizes I've noticed. Lost alot more than I old like to admit today... but completely  operator error.  Gotta leave phone in truck next time...  (yea right)  hope the pics and video turned out.  Been awhile since I've posted pics.  Blk gold and blk chartreuse  did all the damage again today.  All fish were less than 40 fow
