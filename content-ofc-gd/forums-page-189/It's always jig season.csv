900577,crappieperchhunter,2015-02-28 12:44:00,2582,Beautiful work Roy. It's easy to see you enjoy the process and are not just cranking out cookie cutter jig heads. Do you do panfish  sized stuff....1/32 or 1/16size ?
900580,Roy,2015-02-28 13:06:00,13728,"Thanks Crappieperchhunter,  For the time being, the smallest I have is an 1/8th ounce."
900601,PUMP KNOWS,2015-02-28 16:05:00,937,What do you guys target with these jigs?  I never had any luck with jigs before but I would like to learn how to fish them this year.

If you were to make it to the Trent river in Trenton the first week of the season,I would be glad to take you out and show you how we use them for walleye ."
900632,Steve,2015-02-28 19:20:00,2075,"black and yellow bucktail jig...if sunfish are around, they are amazing! roy, those look great!"
900698,Roy,2015-02-28 23:02:00,13728,Thanks Steve. Very kind of you.

900739,singingdog,2015-03-01 12:14:00,1047,"What do you guys target with these jigs?  I never had any luck with jigs before but I would like to learn how to fish them this year. Bass, walleye, lakers, brookies, pike, early season musky. Hair jigs are one of the most versatile lures around, and can save you a pile of $ on plastics.  Here are some that I tie    "
900753,OhioFisherman,2015-03-01 15:03:00,6623,"Nice work! I especially like the style of the top two by singing dog!  "" What do you guys target with these jigs? ""  Largemouth, smallmouth, but anything that swims might eat one, I have caught walleye on them and hooked muskies on them, although not intentionally.  Fish don't have trouble finding a small jig in the pitch black of night, a 1/8 ounce or 3/16th is fine as long as you have a decent hook in it for bass. A small pork frog or plastic on it and you're good to go!"
899693,Roy,2015-02-23 01:25:00,13728,"Well, for most people anyway. Around this time of the year I start to crank them out for the soft water season and for friends who use them. It'd be nice to get tying tips from people who make their own. I buy the best materials/components I can find. I pour my own lead, paint the heads, choose and tie appropriate bucktail, seal everything with epoxy and all is well.  I use Gamakatsu 604's for the models shown in the pic. They work really well. I make the tails a lot thinner than I used to and it makes an enormous difference. Let's hear how you guys do yours.   "
899697,spincast,2015-02-23 01:33:00,3279,Nice work Roy.
899698,Roy,2015-02-23 01:37:00,13728,Thanks Bud.. I appreciate it.
899700,gaspumper,2015-02-23 01:39:00,393,Nice looking Jigs.Here are some of the ones I make. 
899701,Roy,2015-02-23 01:40:00,13728,"BTW, those are from left right. 5/8. 1/2, 3/8 and 1/4 ounce."
899702,Roy,2015-02-23 01:42:00,13728,Very very nice GasPumper! I'm impressed.
899703,bigugli,2015-02-23 01:42:00,6138,"Look great Roy.  I've learnt, as well, that there is such a thing as too much bucktail on the jig. I like to glue the threads twice when tying.  Sorry, no  pics for now, this old loaner can't post up pics, too outdated for photobucket or my camera program."
899705,Roy,2015-02-23 01:46:00,13728,I glue at every wrap.... it's a mental problem I have.
899707,buckster,2015-02-23 01:50:00,530,Nice looking jigs fellas!    I like to add a few strands of crystal flash on the ones I tie.  It gives it a nice touch.
899708,gaspumper,2015-02-23 01:57:00,393,"Funny you mention you glue after every wrap,I started tying in 1975 up until 2 year ago I never glued a jig,now after I finish  tying a jig I add head cement.I wholesale to several stores,and sell to a lot of fishermen in the area."
899719,gaspumper,2015-02-23 02:05:00,393,Here are some other jigs I make.I tie 1/4-3/8-1/2-3/4-and 2 ounce jig in 18 different colors. 
899728,bigugli,2015-02-23 02:57:00,6138, You're not the only person I heard that does not glue their strands.
899801,mike rousseau,2015-02-23 19:05:00,4661,Never tried bucktail jigs...  They look great Roy....
899802,manitoubass2,2015-02-23 19:08:00,11391,They can be deadly on walleye and other panfish. I mainly use them for lakers though.  Im sure they work on pike and musky as well
899809,Mike Pike,2015-02-23 19:40:00,1332,"Really beeeeautiful work there Roy.  Must be well satisfying catching a fish with something you crafted yourself, much like the flytiers would.  You know, even that photo of all the jigs would look great framed!!!"
899833,misfish,2015-02-23 21:52:00,29133,"Those are real purdy brudder. I finally got back the ones you gave me on our charter a couple years ago. LOL  I,ll be giving them a go this spring."
899953,singingdog,2015-02-24 13:08:00,1047,"Nice bucktails! IMHO, you can go even sparser than that, especially for clear water fishing. Nice to see someone using good hooks on bucktails. So many of the jigs I see in tackle shops have crappy hooks."
899957,cram,2015-02-24 13:45:00,1733,"Really nice work.  Those are beauties, guys."
900457,can u fish,2015-02-27 16:11:00,326,Nice looking bucktails there Roy that is all we ever used for walleye fishing the many lakes on Parc de La Verandrye when I was a young lad it has been a while since I have jigged with bucktails now it is jigs with twister tails or with some form of artificial bait.  Cheers Mitch...
900471,Beavertail,2015-02-27 17:17:00,331,"Hey Roy, just curious...why are thinned out tails on bucktails more effective? Seems counter-intuitive to me.  I just ordered some online, since quality jigs are rare in stores around my neck of the woods. I've never used them before, it's been all plastic up till now. I'm pretty excited to try them out this season. BTW, your jigs look mighty fine."
900500,Gerritt,2015-02-27 19:13:00,6129,One question Roy..... Where can I order some?
900509,esoxansteel,2015-02-27 20:09:00,1307,"Hey Roy, just curious...why are thinned out tails on bucktails more effective? Seems counter-intuitive to me.

I'm pretty excited to try them out this season. BTW, your jigs look mighty fine.    Thinner hair allows more hair movement, and pulsing when jiggin, or with any movement ie wind induced current etc, as its not all bulked up, it will also allow for a quicker penetration into the weeds, on the fall, as theres less resistance with less hair, which can be a benefit, or not depending if you want a slower fall, or a faster fall, i tie both for active fish i want a fast fall, and for neutral or inactive fish a slower fall     my 2 cents for what its worth"
900545,Beavertail,2015-02-28 00:48:00,331,Thanks liverelease...that all makes sense.
900570,singingdog,2015-02-28 11:02:00,1047,"I also think that thinner jigs, when in the water, give that translucent quality that a small baitfish has. I make an exception with bear-hair jigs for cold water smallies; I tie those fairly thick."
900573,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-28 11:24:00,8243,"My first impression was they sure look well made, the second was that sure looks to be many jigs. I was  going to ask do you guys sell them or do you guys loose a lot? And my question was answered by gaspumper. Do you sell them Roy? No I don't work for the IRS. When we fished near north and the Ottawa we made our own and poured plastics as well. Other than a Tube I haven't used either plastic or Marabou since moving to Erie. That's a lie, I haven't used other jigs since I find certain tubes out fishes other jigs 10 to 1.  Roy I bought the standard molds at a great price south of Niagara Falls NY. They were of better quality of those I bought up here. No imperfections and the molds seemed to last forever. It was an advantage to have a massive Tool and Die shop at the plant and an oldtimer there loved fishing and made me all the molds for my plastic Beetle Spinner Shads, twister tails and worms. I had him mold a spot in the grub heads and worms to take a small piece of Alka Seltzer. I wonder if anyone still uses Alka Setzer or Brioski  (sic) in their Tubes or plastics?"
