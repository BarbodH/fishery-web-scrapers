901312,kickingfrog,2015-03-03 22:59:00,8333,"dont know how busy it is these days but we went mid week, first thing in the morning to avoid the crowds (i hate crowds). not cheap, but worth it if you have kids.   Even odds that Raf is making the exact same face.  My son loved it and we'll go again and again. Take TTC or GO to save on parking and the kids get a train ride as well. And yes, buy your tickets in advance."
901321,kickingfrog,2015-03-03 23:21:00,8333,"Surprised you fellow fish lovers aren't opposed to the aquarium. I've never been, but I do hear that there are lots of very impressive areas there.  Keep in mind that these fish are probably replaced regularly. Are we really wasting fish's lives by putting them on display and killing them slowly? All the while someone in an office is profitting from these animals' lives?  Valid considerations, although fish lovers isn't the best descriptor. As well, some ""bird lovers"" feed migrating birds during the winter and interfering with their natural migrations, while others might keep a song bird in a cage,  Anyway, back to the well morality of aquariums  Part of the counter would be that due to where many of us live we'll never see these types of animals, it allows us to better appreciate them and maybe consider them when dealing with the environment. Some of these aquariums (not sure about this one) also study and research these animals to better understand them and how we might help them in their natural habitats that we are encroaching on more, and more each day.  That doesn't give aquariums free reign either and we should ask questions and hold them accountable for their displays."

901372,Rattletrap2,2015-03-04 00:44:00,1652,I was extremely fortunate to be invited to a private party there last Spring. This Company rented out the whole place from 6pm to 10 pm and provided free food and drinks. Most of the people attending were drawn to the free bar....so I had the place virtually to myself for the evening! Awesome experience!
901440,MJL,2015-03-04 02:57:00,2427,"I went in August with my sister, brother in-law and 2 nephews. As others have mentioned, buy the tickets in advance or you could be waiting for a while (probably not so much a problem if you go during the week during a snow storm). Great place to visit and wouldn't mind going back in a few years. Would've loved to have a go with the fishing rod in the shark tank.LOL                                   "

901150,Acountdeleted,2015-03-03 12:19:00,2562,I loved it. The girlfriend pet sting rays and sharks. I never wanted to leave the fresh water section. They have paddle fish!!!
901153,Steve,2015-03-03 12:29:00,2075,"it is very cool.  however, due to location, it is not overly cheap by any means.  a few friends from Hamilton have mentioned they thought the cost did not equal the return - I don't agree.  But just a heads up."
901156,FloatnFly,2015-03-03 13:08:00,1640,great place! apparently seeing this guy is rare.  only problem i had was the raging head ache afterward due to bent glass everywhere and magnification from it.

901185,mepps,2015-03-03 15:51:00,1301,"great shot Raf!  I got the year pass almost a year ago and have been several time. Personally I have more negative things to say than positive, but most are related to the overcrowding.  If you go on weekend, expect a TON of people. Expect to spend a lot. Expect to have the nearby parking lot full if there are any other events at the Metro Centre/Skydome/CN tower.  The design has a lot of bottleneck areas and people will bunch up. Expect people to bump into you, especially when you are tying to take a photo. Don't expect them to apologize. Expect a lot of strollers to hot your ankles. Expect people to try push in front of you if there is a lineup forming. Expect very few food options, and lineups for food (which I found strange considering the high quality food right next door at the CN tower). Better off getting some street-meat outside before/after visiting.  On a good note, expect to see some awesome displays (even if they are a little small for such big fish). There is a ton of different species to check out, including some big sharks. My 7 year old son loves to go, but I find myself spending less time looking at fish more time trying to keep an eye on him so he isn't swept away in the crowds.  My expectations were very high, but thats only because I have visited some of the top aquariums in the world (such as Georgia Aquarium) which put this one to shame in every way.   easyfish - I hear ya bud. It is a little sad if you stop to think about it. Much like to zoo I guess. I'd like to think the people working there really do care about the welfare of the animals though."
901198,Gallie,2015-03-03 16:54:00,1215,"I have no argument for this because you are right, i have always had pets in aquariums and terrariums but have often wondered about the morality of it. Is it wrong for me to have a tarantula in captivity for my enjoyment? Is it wrong for anyone to keep anything as a pet? Since we are on the topic is it wrong for us to use live bait? Hooking worms minnows and etc to catch fish? And lastly to hook and fight a fish undoubtedly stressing it out and risking its life for our personal pleasure just to let it go so someone else can do the same? I understand  these are not directly related but if im going to ask myself tough moral questions it always comes back to the one regarding my greatest passion in life. For now though if im going to keep fishing and i have already visited and therefore supported the aquarium, ill have to leave those questions for another day."

901219,Headhunter,2015-03-03 17:55:00,5703,"Easyfish, your comment got me thinking... should we have animals in our possession for our own gratification? So, I decided to ask an expert... my Lab. We had a good chat and decided that he much preferred to be fed by us as opposed to chasing his meals and fighting for territory with all the other dogs. He feels pretty comfortable in his bed and figures that it is worth it to him to give up some of his personal freedoms, in order to live a happy life with our family. I know he can't speak for the animals at Ripley's, nor can he speak for the various animals locked in the zoo, but I thought I would pass this along so perhaps you can gain an appreciation for another point of view. Your mileage may differ. HH  PS... I would quote you but I haven't been able to do that since the last system upgrade here. "

901234,manitoubass2,2015-03-03 18:50:00,11391,Huskies.  Pretty sure they just wanna eat the fish.  But if the fish are gonna die might as not go to waste
901236,Beavertail,2015-03-03 18:55:00,331,"Keeping animals in captivity for our own enjoyment is a personal, moral issue. However, keeping low intelligent critters like fish and tarantulas in captivity, compared with keeping highly evolved animals like chimps and dolphins are worlds apart IMO. I'm completely speculating here, but pretty sure those fish don't know any better...and are just as content as their wild brethren all the while getting free meals and not stressing over getting eaten by something bigger."
