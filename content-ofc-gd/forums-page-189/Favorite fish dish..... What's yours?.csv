901687,bigugli,2015-03-05 03:44:00,6138,  I'm just not fond of cod in general.  I can still remember the smell of the gut piles some 40 years later.  We were downwind of a fish wharf and packing plant for a couple of summers down east.
901692,Sinker,2015-03-05 04:55:00,8692,"I'll take a fresh cod any day! I was raised on it. You'd think a guy would get sick of it, after hauling traps full of them 3 times a day, cleaning up to 15,000 lbs of them.....but I still love it. The last time I was in NFLD, the first one I jigged up I took a bite out of it lol.  My old man salts his own still to this day.  Gerrit, that salt cod meal you posted is similar to what we call ""fish, fat, taties an dat"". Its basically the same, but we use fried salt pork ""scrunchions"" for the fat part, and dont add the hot sauce.  The fish and brewis is basically boiled salt cod, with hard bread. You could google it.  Cod au gratin...or whatever fish you choose ( I like perch or pike, has to be kinda meaty, solid fish). Just take a glass pan (9 x 13) make a white sauce (butter, flour and water basically) put a layer of fillets, layer of white sauce, then your favourite cheddar, another layer of fish, sauce cheese....until full. Top off with cracker crumbs and more cheddar, bake until ready.  Can you tell I just wing it? LOL. No real recipes.  Its funny how newfies and europeans share a lot of similar meals.  My old man is a chef. I grew up eating well, and still love to cook. I do 90 percent of the cooking at home too.  S."
900993,Gerritt,2015-03-02 16:44:00,6129,"EVOO=extra virgin olive oil:)  No problem with the questions, happy to answer them:)  I think this dish is well worth the effort and anticipation.... We make several batches of the cod at a time to freeze and pull out when we want it... Usually 2-3 times a months. We love it:)"
900996,manitoubass2,2015-03-02 16:51:00,11391,"If you like to cook(or love to cook)  You should always have EVOO on hand.  Stuff is amazing.  To see how amazing it is, make some spaghetti. Drizzle with olive oil, add salt and pepper, and a little parmesan cheese.  Thats traditional pasta on my italian side(of course gramps makes his own noodles)  And serve on polenta if you can  Just remember olive oil burns at 350 I think? Its not fit for deep frying etc"
901041,bigugli,2015-03-02 19:35:00,6138,"  I like dishes with polenta, but polenta does not agree with me. A tad too heavy."
901044,bigugli,2015-03-02 19:41:00,6138,"Dried, salted/flaked cod are a European staple, but I've never been a big fan whether it be Italian bacala al sugo, or it be Scandinavian lutefisk in creme sauce.  However I do get a hankering for Dutch lekkerbekes or kibblings like what I get at St Jakobs market. Usually, one helping just isn't enough."
901045,manitoubass2,2015-03-02 19:45:00,11391,Nah. Serve appropriately. If its too heavy adjust. Polenta is of the gods

Most included homemade wine in the dish...  While I dont have my own wine cellar, this dish is on par with the various versions other family members make...  Take your bacalhau or salt cod cut into large pieces and soak for 5 days changing out the water often... Every 6-12 hours.  make sure the cod is completely covered in water... I find a large measure cup is handy for this...  Portion and freeze until ready to use.... Do not soak them to thaw... Keep in the freezer bag and thaw the fish in it.  Next pour olive oil in a pan and add chopped onions...     Cook till translucent...   Here is the soaked fish ready for the pan...    And the garlic.... Lots of it. And not the cheap Chinese crap. Get Canadian garlic if you can.... US garlic is not bad either...    Some green onions too...    Getting happy...... Together    This is a must have in any European mans pantry... Not too spicy, and not too much salt. Perfect for cooking with.    Getting even happier!..... Smells so good!    And here is the end result... Served with mashed potatoes and corn. With a fresh baguette for the sauce..... Along with a nice Cab. Sauv.      Always served family style.  Hope you enjoy...  And share yours!

Wicked good dish and the whole house smells fantastic lol  I served ours with some fry bread to clean up the sauce. Nothing else. The dish speaks for itself?"

The best fish dish I ever tasted in my life was at the Fraser River Fishing Lodge.  The chef poached some halibut stuffed with salmon in a very light buttery wine sauce.  It was simple but intensely delicious... and really, it's hard to beat both those fish even when they're cooked poorly."

901534,Joey,2015-03-04 15:54:00,9122,"That looks so good G.   I have tried many recipes, but my tried and true fave has always been the easy, plain old trout fried in butter, garlic and a bit of salt and pepper.  Used to catch them fresh out of the Bow River in the mountains outside of Canmore, AB and just fry them up right there in the pan.  I did it with the trout we caught out of Lake of Bays last year too and was still as delish as ever."
901540,jimmer,2015-03-04 16:12:00,2730,"Any white meat made in a peanut/curry/spicy sauce with peppers and onions. I prefer bluegill for this, but have made it with walleye and pike also. Marinate the fillets in a curry spice mix. Cut up some peppers and onions and cook in some extra virgin olive oil Add a can of coconut milk when peppers and onions are tender. Add a teaspoon of peanut buttter into milk and any spices that you like. (I use a package satay mix) Bring to a simmer so the mixture is bubbling slightly. Lay fish on top of this and cover until fish flakes. Stir all together gently and serve over a bed of rice or whatever. A nice change from the breaded and fried fish."

901551,bigugli,2015-03-04 16:59:00,6138,"  Simple to do.  I'm only guessing on measures because we have never actually measured out  or written the recipe. Growing up in Gram's kitchen, you learned. Recipe can be done without the stock, simple adding 2-3 qts water instead. Makes a milder, (not as full, in my opinion) flavour. The fish heads are strictly for making your stock. Done the night you clean your fish. Last time around it was 2 dozen perch heads, tsp salt 1/2 tsp pepper, pinch of garlic, 1/2 dozen allspice balls simmering in 2-3 qts. water for about  1 hr, or reduced by half. Pour into fine strainer, and there is your stock. Get  2 fine chopped onion, saute til soft in 2 tbsp butter. Pour in stock and add 1/2 a celery stem diced, 1 large peeled carrot diced, 4-5 large taters, in 1"" cubes, and 1/2 dozen more whole allspice (When kids see them in the bowl, you tell them those are the fish eyes).  Slow boil for 20 minutes. Now the good stuff. We used pike because that was the easiest way to cook pike. My folks never fileted pike. Add 2lbs boneless filets of any white fish, I'll also add clams with juice, small shrimp, scallops, seafood medley, whatever floats your boat. Let that simmer 10 minutes. To this you the add 2 qts. Milk and cream, mixed to how rich you want it. Add a little more salt and pepper to taste if desired. This will still need to cook another 15 minutes on lower heat. Stir constantly. When it's this thick it sticks to the bottom real easy.  You should wind up with a gallon of hearty goodness."

This fish itself is firm and flakey but holds together well and has a slight salty taste, but it's different then just throwing table salt on something, that's the only way I can describe it.  I would typically use 1/4 cup of EVO and 1/4 of the paste (more of a sauce really) but you can adjust this to taste.  We would typically boil up rough cut potatoes or have a rice pilaf with this dish... But we had some left over mashed potatoes so I fried them up to use em up.  Give it a try, I think you might be surprised. Be sure to change the water at least once a day twice if possible.. And in the 5th day every 6 or so hours to cut out as much of the salt as possible  Let me know how you made out, I bet you won't be disappointed!  G"
