900303,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-26 16:18:00,8243,"I know everything north was late i.e. weed growth. I can only talk about Erie. Even though the lake was 100% frozen for the first time in many, many years the Bass and Walleye were right on time. Bass were off the beds before opening. Some how the lake temps came up very fast in June. The perch however stayed deep and stayed there all season here.  I can't see this fishing season as much different, perhaps a bit better because last winter was colder than this year. That cold snap in December lasted until April. Yesterday a farmer I know well told us this spring will bring winter temps, I wanted to bop him in the snazz."
900308,mattaw,2015-02-26 17:00:00,162,"Things can change quickly. But we can't control the weather. Last year was one of my best years ever, you just have to be prepared to experiment to find a pattern that is working and grind it out. Not the most fun at all times, but interesting and quite a learning experience."
900329,NAW,2015-02-26 20:04:00,4022,I love getting of for hardwater perch on simcoe in a t-shirt.!
900408,bobowski,2015-02-27 06:44:00,360,Fishing on the ice listening to the Jays game is a beautiful thing.
900428,Sinker,2015-02-27 13:26:00,8692,"Yep, some of the best fishing, and get a tan without sweating your butt off. LOVE spring hardwater fishing!  S."
900440,JoshS,2015-02-27 14:22:00,729,I'm a fan of the later spring. Still too early to say though...
900486,Sinker,2015-02-27 18:16:00,8692,"Yes, too early to predict a late spring for sure. I don't know why people are so up in arms about a tough winter. Its been nothing close to a hard winter. Im tapping trees today. I know its early, but its going to happen sooner or later.  S."
900495,crappieperchhunter,2015-02-27 18:53:00,2582,"Yes, too early to predict a late spring for sure. I don't know why people are so up in arms about a tough winter.

Did you fall and hurt yourself recently  February has been harsh. More cold and snow in a 4 week span then I have every experienced. But December and January where awesome. I'd take our Dec-Jan weather we got this year every winter for the rest of my life if I could get it."
900510,Sinker,2015-02-27 20:11:00,8692,"Nope, no injuries lately. We have school groups starting next week, so have to have everything done. My trees at home won't be touched for a while yet.  S."

900525,PUMP KNOWS,2015-02-27 22:21:00,937,"Last year was so brutal but a good angler finds what has changed and changes his game plan.  And I agree, give us spring this time instead of jumping right into summer."
900594,OhioFisherman,2015-02-28 14:29:00,6623,"Here in the tropics it was -14 f when I woke up, the last day of February? Unless the spring heats up fast here we may have ice around the docks and marinas into April? Usually next month sometime (March) is the start of the spring walleye run up some of the rivers, and April is usually prime crappie time, that may get delayed a bit?  We are currently at our 5th winter on record with days below zero f, there is more ice on the lakes and snow pack on the ground than normal, that usually means the water isn't going to warm up anytime soon?  The county that I live in has the largest number of private ponds in the state, I suspect that winter fish kill will be a problem for a lot of them.  http://ohioline.osu.edu/a-fact/0008.html"
900168,knightfisher,2015-02-25 21:09:00,237,I'm thinking ice out will be later this year.  Will this delay spawning in some species ?  Do you think this will change the timing of the spring bite ?  Wondering what your thoughts are.  
900170,ccmtcanada,2015-02-25 21:16:00,7971,Was a very late spring last year and yes it did affect the spawn.  Fishing was really tough for me in the spring and early summer.  Fish weren't in the same spots they usually were!!!
900172,Fisherpete,2015-02-25 21:19:00,1814,"Yes, yes and yes. Everything will happen later...  I'm hoping Lake O does not stay cold all summer like last year either..."
900173,esoxansteel,2015-02-25 21:22:00,1307,"Had to adjust somewhat, for the first time i added a stinger hook on the back of my bucktails for walleyes, and 70% of my walleyes were on the stinger in May, Pond weed was slow to develop, but was still present in July so it hung on later"
900178,chris.brock,2015-02-25 21:29:00,4053,"Things can change quick, but if it's late like last year, fine with me.  I thought the walleye fishing was great early season, plus flat lining lakers on May 2-4 weekend.  I booked the week off before May 2-4 this year"
900181,BillM,2015-02-25 21:41:00,17367,As long as we don't go from winter right into summer like last year we'll be fine.  We barely had a spring last year!  That screwed up pretty much everything.
900196,Joeytier,2015-02-25 22:48:00,3990,"Kind of hard to say this early on whether or not it will be a late spring, since it's not even march yet"
900197,Rich Clemens,2015-02-25 22:57:00,3131,"Yeah ..... It was a fought year last year catching fish while we were up there.  Lots of follows, but no takers"
900201,spincast,2015-02-25 23:22:00,3279,"Yes, yes and yes. Everything will happen later...  I'm hoping Lake O does not stay cold all summer like last year either... X2 on that one Pete, but it sure isn't looking good right now, .. http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/the-great-lakes-freeze-up-is-in-full-swing-heres-what-it-looks-like/45873/  Cover on February 21: 52.7 per cent 2014 maximum: 61.5 per cent 14 day forecast still doesn't show any highs above freezing, and the daily lows still dipping frequently into the double digits."
900202,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-25 23:39:00,956,Now I see why I sucked last year.  It was the weather and not me.
900209,FloatnFly,2015-02-26 00:18:00,1640,"means cold waters once again, unless this summer is outlandishly hot, they won't warm up above 65F  As long as we don't go from winter right into summer like last year we'll be fine.  We barely had a spring last year!  That screwed up pretty much everything.   we actually had a good spring last year, think you're thinking of 2013, but heres the 2014 monthly weather for Toronto https://weatherspark.com/history/28448/2014/Toronto-Ontario-Canada"
900210,Gallie,2015-02-26 00:19:00,1215,"I did really well for pike crappie and carp last spring, the salmon were tough to find in the summer though as they were scattered like the temperatures. However we still managed to find a few tyees. And muskie is muskie lol"

900221,Joeytier,2015-02-26 01:11:00,3990,No kidding!  Even up north January and December were both very relatively mild without a ton of snow and all of a sudden it's a brutal winter after 2-3 weeks of seasonal weather.  It's only February people!!
900222,gaspumper,2015-02-26 01:14:00,393,I find the later the spring the better the walleye bite at Quinte.
900226,ecmilley,2015-02-26 01:36:00,2163,Last years late spring made some days tougher but overall was a great spring for crappie and eyes
900247,mike rousseau,2015-02-26 05:58:00,4661,It will definitely be a late spring... And yes it will effect fishing...  The st lawrence seaway won't open till the end of March this year...  I can't remember the last time I couldn't get the boat in the river in March... But I doubt I'll be able to this year...  Just have to adapt a bit...  Had one of my best years last year but I made a lot of changes....
900248,mike rousseau,2015-02-26 06:01:00,4661,It's been a beautiful winter...  But the ice coverage (at least here) this year is more then I've seen in a while...
900250,fishindevil,2015-02-26 10:03:00,6254,Yes going to be a delayed spring for sure and will affect the bite !!!! Going to be a cold spring too as the Great Lakes are almost all frozen & all that cold water will affect our weather for sure bring ing more rain & cold weather and unstable weather according to those who know !!!!  And iff the azz hats lower the Kawartha lakes any lower than they are right now we won't have a launch to use !!!!! Down 3-4 feet  crazy lowest I have seen
900255,Gallie,2015-02-26 12:30:00,1215,That oughta produce a few motor ticklers in some spots ?
900295,Lunkerhunter,2015-02-26 15:44:00,455,"I too am enjoying this years winter. fishing has been great too so that is a bonus. sled trails are beautiful right now too, finally putting some kms on my machine.  also last year fishing was incredible. yes you have to adapt but from catfish to muskie they all need to eat."
900301,AKRISONER,2015-02-26 16:06:00,5558,"i caught pickerels on GB all the way to Canada day last year, thats unheard of for us.  Usually come June the fish are gone out into the open areas and fishing becomes way more difficult.  I didnt mind the lower weed cover, kept a lot of spots active longer before they became surfaced out. Last years fishing wasnt bad for me at all. Kept the bigger fish out of the bigger water and back in the channels longer.  Also cant complain about jiggin perch in April hard water."
