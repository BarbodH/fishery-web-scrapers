I have been doing real good on splake fishing at school but it felt nice to have something on the line that put up a fight Anyhow, we got 10 fish in total and lost numerous amount of fish mid fight   damn humpacks!!!! The key to this trip... the tactics that I would use for perch fishing... Shallow water was key for these buggers!!  well heres a look at the fish                Now its back up to school for some splake and smelt fishing...  Tight lines, Luc"

900169,luclarochelle,2015-02-25 21:10:00,37,How deep did you find the whitey's at Luc ? 30 to 50 fow
900183,misfish,2015-02-25 21:47:00,29133,"Thats some real nice fish there dude.  If you get into the smelts,mind posting a pic of them. Would like to see the size your getting."
900186,luclarochelle,2015-02-25 22:05:00,37,  This is about the average size of the smelt as well as the splake!!
900189,misfish,2015-02-25 22:21:00,29133,"Nice.  I enjoy catching them, as I love eating them."
900194,xxgoaler,2015-02-25 22:44:00,106,"Thanks Luc, been fishing just over 50 fow, maybe time to come in a bit, nice fish, need me some, the wife has been trying to hook one but unsuccessful so far this year.  Maybe this weekend"
900211,123chadder,2015-02-26 00:21:00,165,"Whities have been extremely shallow this year, blame the gobies!   Good shooting! i cant catch them in any less than 90 fow....."
900217,luclarochelle,2015-02-26 00:48:00,37,i cant catch them in any less than 90 fow..... They are all over the place!! I just tried something new and got success! Ive never had much luck in deep water myself but have marked a ton of whities out in the 90 fow range. It comes down to a preference thing for sure
900259,Mister G,2015-02-26 13:01:00,1429,They are all over the place!! I just tried something new and got success! Ive never had much luck in deep water myself but have marked a ton of whities out in the 90 fow range. It comes down to a preference thing for sure Those shallow water fish are on the feed while those deep water fish are mostly not.  NICE CATCH AND GREAT REPORT ! ! !
900263,BillM,2015-02-26 13:10:00,17367,"i cant catch them in any less than 90 fow.....  When you think you're too shallow, go shallower"
900264,Tim Mills,2015-02-26 13:10:00,476,Impressive
