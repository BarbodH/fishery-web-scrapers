900844,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-02 00:20:00,8243,"Back in the 70's 3 men, the father, the son and son in law all lost their lives on a calm day on Nipissing. They were neighbors of my in-laws. They had bought a cottage west of the place they had sold. The idea was to load the swimming raft with furniture and boxes tie it all down and tow it with a cedar strip with a 15 horse to the new place around the point and across a bay. It would have saved hours of work if it worked out , it did not. They loaded for the last trip and the folks on land left by car to meet them at the dock. The friends and family on land waited but the boat never showed up. Someone went back to the cottage hoping to find the boat and raft there presuming that they may have backtracked if there was a problem. A half hour went by when the OPP and an EMS bus showed up. Somehow the boat and raft capsized. All 3 men drowned. To this day there is no definitive answer for the family as no one witnessed it. Loosing 3 men from the same family on the same afternoon must be beyond tragic. There many lessons to be learned here."
901005,Dave Bailey,2015-03-02 17:05:00,1641,"Probably this.  Nothing crazy, the worst part was getting it caught on the rope while loading the boat back up and heading to Soldiers Memorial in Orillia, lol!   Back on the water by 10:30     Same place I had this one removed, I'll bet they do a roaring trade every summer!    My daughter hooked me, we kid her that she caught a 180 lb loudmouth bass."

It also fits with what I humbly call Bailey's First Law: Necessity may be the mother of invention, but laziness is usually the father."
901159,Dave Bailey,2015-03-03 13:40:00,1641,"Back in '06 we took a family vacation up in Moosonee, stayed at Tidewater Provincial Park. One day we paid one of the local water taxi guys to take us fishing a few kilometres up the river, in one of those big James Bay freighter canoes. Just started to hook into some nice fish when the sky suddenly turned black. Ok, pack up the gear and scream as fast as we could back to town - looked up and saw a funnel cloud starting directly above the canoe. Fortunately it didn't develop past a small spike, but then the hail started. Our guide gunned it for an island in the river and we hit the beach like a military assault. He got the wife and kids under a tarp that he wedged into some tree roots coming out of an embankment about 2 metres high, while I was jumping on the anchor to make sure it was driven securely into the gravel. After it let up a bit we got back, and had him drop us off in town, where we got a hotel room instead of going back to the campsite. Talked to some locals in a restaurant that night and they told us that it was the worst storm they could ever remember, and that there were reliable reports of tornadoes touching down in the muskeg west of town."

900129,Gregoire,2015-02-25 15:54:00,1397,"The scariest thing that ever happened to me was on LOTW on a musky trip. I was fishing with Cowanjo, and another guy who we met at Sandy's Blackhawk. We had located a big fish that was about 35km from camp, in a place where not a lot of other boats were fishing. We managed to boat her that night, a big fish that won John the biggest fish at the University of Essox musky school that week. When we decided to start up the motor to head back to camp, right as night had started to fall, it would the motor was dead.  Those of you who have been to LOTW will know that it is a huge body of water, with 10's of thousands of islands, not to mentions bays and channels. We were well off the beaten path, and had not seen another boat that evening. We had not even seen a cottage that night, and did not know of any camps, or habitable shorelines that were close by. We all had cell phones on us, but none of us had reception. Luckily, just as our motor died, a boat puled close to us. We managed to flag him down, and he came by to check on us. The following is my recollection of our encounter:  Guy in a new Ranger with a 250 and a 15hp on the back ""What's up guys?"" Us: ""Can you help us out, our motor won't start"" Ranger Guy ""I just pulled in to this reef and it's primetime, I don't want to mess up my fishing"" Us ""We are kinda stuck and our camp is 30 km's away, is there anything you can do?"" Ranger Guy ""Why don't you keep trying the motor, I'm just going to fish this reef again."" He motors over to the reef.  We try for what seems like an hour to get the motor started, but It was probably 10 minutes or so. The guy is in sight, and just keeps fishing. Finally he hits his motor, and comes over to see us.  Ranger Guy ""Any luck?"" Us ""None, the motor seems dead. Any Chance you can help us out?"" Ranger Guy Stammers a bit, seems to want to keep fishing and pretend like he never saw us. ""My camp is in the opposite direction of you guys."" Us ""Maybe you could give one of us a lift back to camp? We are really sorry, but we are stuck."" Ranger guy ""I was all set up to fish this reef, and it is just getting in to the prime time, are you sure there's nothing else I can do? Us ""We are sorry to be such a pain, but we are stuck, and really need some help.""  Anyway, after what seemed like an endless dialogue the guy finally agrees to take John back to the camp. leaving Tim and I in the boat. So we end up in the middle of nowhere, using the trolling motor to slowly motor in the direction of camp.  Eventually a boat with Jim Saric, Steve Heiting and Kevin Schmidt came to rescue us, just around the time that a large lightning storm was rolling in. The first thing Heiting says to us is, ""I heard you caught a big one, can I see the pic?""  We ended up docking our boat at an abandoned summer camp, Friday the 13th styles. I was the first on the dock, and my first step went through a rotted out plank. I fall down, avoid injury, get up and make a joke about it. Saric scolds me and tells me to hurry up, as there is a storm coming. Heiting reminds us to bring the camera, as we'll want the pic of the big girl. We then have a frantic ride in to camp trying to beat the oncoming storm.  The tow craziest things were: 1. Ranger guy, who if he wasn't sure that we could identify his boat probably would have left us there, and; 2. Spending an hour and a half in what seemed like total darkness using the trolling motor to make our way back to camp. I was so nervous i just kept rambling, because I was totally terrified."
900140,Joey,2015-02-25 17:58:00,9122,"Jeez Dan, the guy in the Ranger was a jerk for sure.  Isn't it illegal to leave a person in a boat stranded if you are able to help them????"
900141,Gregoire,2015-02-25 18:05:00,1397,"I'm guessing that is why they helped us out, but they sure were not happy about it. The irony of it all is that on the way back to our camp their engine light turned on. Turned out they were really low on engine oil. John had to scramble to find some at our camp for their boat sop they could make it back to camp."

Right place right time for the rescue"
900230,Acountdeleted,2015-02-26 02:03:00,2562," How are you still alive?!?!   I have been very blessed to just have 'near misses' over the years. Kayaked to the Toroto islands, South winds picked up and I had to power paddle back up the Eastern gap to get back to Cherry beach. Made it but my arms were unbelievably sore.  Was on a lake 30 km away from Lac Seul when it was hit by a Tornado..... Geez, was that really 7 years ago? We were on a long narrow finger lake about an hours boat ride from camp in a 12ft with a 9.9 and the waves were HUGE. We thought for sure we were going to have to spend the night on an island until the lodge owner came and rescued us.  Had to take a 12 foot boat from Frenchmans bay to Duffins creek to install some temp loggers. On the ride back, waves are close to 3 feet. I ask the girl with me 'do you trust me' she says yes. We get back an hour later, safe but she looks like a ghost. All she has to say is 'let's never do that again'.  My closest brush with death wasn't even fishing but rather tree planting. Middle of June in Hearst. Wake up to clear sky's and 5 degree temps so I throw on a few layers. Bus drops a small group of us off to finish a job. 30 minutes later, torrential downpour and my layers of cotton are soaked. I had to keep moving to keep warm and planted a ton of trees but by about 4pm I'm thinking if the bus doesn't get there soon, I may come close to hypothermia. Thankfully it wasn't long after that it did. I tried feeling bad for myself that day until I learned a girl on another crew did that same day in a t-shirt. Man, women are tough."
900232,solopaddler,2015-02-26 02:10:00,8605,"I hope this does not come across as rude because it's not the intent.  How are you still alive?!?!  Not rude at all. The answer is a little bit of skill and a lot of luck. Bear in mind the law of averages played a role in the number of mishaps. For a great many years all I did - literally was travel the north paddling and fishing.  When I write a book I'm going to call it ""I almost died!"""

Like most folks I've towed a few boats in or offered help in other ways but always wonder exactly what we were obligated to do as far as the law goes.  I talked to an OPP Marine unit cop last summer and asked him how far we were required to tow someone and he said there is actually nothing specifically layed out for that. He said basically you have to help someone in distress as long as your not endangering your own life but how far you tow them is more or less up to you.  Actually, I think he was sorta stuck for answer."

Hmmmmmm............. anyway, last year while helping release a muskie the fish slashed and somehow caught my knuckle. 2 deep tooth gashes right to the bone. Blood everywhere. Didn't even know it happened till Dax told me I was bleeding. We wrapped it up and caught several more muskie that day . While fishing bass I had a fish hit my rapala popper. I set the hook right at the same time as the fish jumped, and the lure shot out of its mouth like a slingshot. The back treble went right through my shorts into my knee. Pushed it through, cut it and carried on."

And it wasn't only your shirt you took off to dry out. That is a image I can not get out of my head. You did a complete backward 360, at least a 8.9 from the Italian judge.

900789,lunkerbasshunter,2015-03-01 18:57:00,2585,"I was fishing the south bay of Lake nipissing about 7 plus years ago.  I was on the west side where the mouth of the south river meets the lake. Was trolling for ""eyes"" when I saw about 10 to 15 large cruisers rushing inland.  By the time I got me gear locked up and moved east to see over the treeline it was to late.  A major storm blew threw and I rushed with my little 9.9 hp and 16ft tinner rented from fish bay into an empty boat house.  I knew the area and the one boat house was only a few years old.  Good call cause the other one that I could have hid in actually was blown over.  Not sure if it was a twister or not but when you are in a boat house with a tin roof in a major storm it is pretty well the scariest thing possible.  When the storm passed and I got out, it was crazy the damage.  Boat houses, boats, docks and trees all over the place.  Took 5 hours on lk nipissing rd to to get out because of the tree limbs littered on the roads."
900793,manitoubass2,2015-03-01 19:10:00,11391,Man that would be scary!  Ive been near three tornados in my life and they are so crazy! Only one on the water though.  I was fishing a small inland lake with my mom and dad. A storm popped up quick and we hit shore quickly.  That was insane. Within minutes it was completely black. My mom and i held each other down while looking for shelter. It was kinda like what id assume walking on the moon is like lol.  Trees crashed all around us for a good 3 minutes or so and in the dark it was very scary.  And as quick as it came it was over. As the sun came back out it was a miracle nobody was hit by a tree. Trees over everywhere.  But about 100 yards away every tree seemed to be broken at the same angle. I think that was the tornados path.  Scary stuff indeed
900800,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-01 20:03:00,8243,"Those are some scary stories boys and girls, very scary.  No other body of water can blow up faster than Nipissing. The inlaws had a place between Callander and South Bay. Brother in law Bobby and my self headed out to Gull Rock on  table flat water with Bluebird skies. It became jet black over Sturgeon Falls in a matter of minute. We knew enough to head in forthwith. By the time we got about a mile the storm was on us. We also knew well enough to find the closest shoreline as well. The mistake Bobby made, he was at the business end of the 18 foot Powassin  with the 20 on back not me, was to turn 90 degrees to the shoreline. I perched myself at the bow to watch for rocks. I will never forget what I saw when we were at the crest of a 6 foot wave and never want to see again. When we hit the top of a  wave I could look down and could see wet sand and wet rocks. Just as the nose if that boat was ready to hit bottom the water would fill that abyss. He quickly decided to start riding the waves at an angle and with about 8"" of water by the time we beached the barge and kissed the ground. That storm lasted what seemed to be forever because all I could think was we were going to spend a cold wet night in cold wet clothes. No light, matched, dry clothes, the cell phone had not yet been invented and no food. There isn't a day I head out on any water without having the aforementioned items and much more including a VHF radio, never"

I remember it had been ultra dry weather for about a week and this day was exceptionally hot. We could hear the thunder off in the distance and I was getting excited. I kept thinking 'a dash of rain will be perfect to cool things off'. It was more then a dash of rain, trees were blowing over, logs were getting tossed around. We hid behind a slash pile under tubs to protect ourselves. Thankfully no one was hurt.  After the storm, I'm walking along the path and Dynamic_bear is on the bus going the other way.

Stayed in the lodge for 3 days then crossed back to the north shore again. We checked the weather for a week before the trip and knew the weather would be good.  Long trip in a 14 footer but you could sure see how folks could get into a heap of trouble on that big old lake.

I was only a few miles from him so I called him and we arranged to hook up.  I arrived at his house a couple days later, we did a bit of small talk then headed out. We trolled for 20 minutes then swung into a bay to do some casting and on about the 5th cast I got this girl. Trouble was when I reached in the net for her she swung around and ripped her teeth across the index finger on my left hand and tore it open bad enough that a pool of blood was rapidly forming around my feet.  I wanted a picture of the fish but the problem was this boat had a white vinyl floor and I was quickly making it look like a war zone.  Anyways, the picture was taken, the fish was released unharmed and my finger was wrapped up and then I cleaned up the boat.  I'd only just met this guy less than an hour ago and didn't assume he was too impressed but we became good friends and often laughed about it later on.  You can see the blood on my left hand   "

It went through the sole of my boot right through my foot and out the top of my boot.  7.Was swept over a dam in November while wading at the top into some heavy white water. Lost pretty much everything and was banged up pretty good.   There are many more, but those are the ones that pop to mind."

900017,solopaddler,2015-02-24 20:36:00,8605,"Okay, Mike wins.   I'd like to hear more about the polar bear story  Okay.  I was in the midst of a really long 3 month solo canoe trip and was on the lower Winisk River maybe 10km's upstream from Peawanuck and the coast of Hudson's Bay.. In the middle of the night I was awoken by some loud noises and peeked outside my tent. There were 3 polar bears in my camp tossing my pots and pans around. They were between me and my canoe so I couldn't make a break for it. They also knew damn well I was in the tent - they kept glancing over at me.  Bear in mind my panic level was rising, I had no firearm and there were no trees to climb.  I put my shoes on then when they looked preoccupied I slipped out the back of my tent through the vestibule and started running upstream, FAST. I had passed a small cabin the day before and knew it was about 1/2km upstream from my campsite.  I made it to the cabin in the dark with no light, expecting to be pulled down by one of the bears at any moment. Raced around the cabin in a panic and couldn't get in - it was boarded up like fort knox with thick heavy plywood over the windows and doors with nails sticking out to deter bears. I grabbed the eave and managed to dead lift myself up to the edge of the roof then pulled myself up onto it. Within 30 seconds all 3 bears trotted into the clearing. At any given time over the course of the next 21/2 days at least one, sometimes all 3 bears were siting there in the clearing staring at me. There is zero doubt they would have eaten me.  I was starting to get weak and was desperate to make a move when a freighter with two natives came from upstream. At that point there was one bear in the clearing. They stopped, looked at the bear, looked at me, then burst out laughing. The guy in the stern pulled out a rifle and fired a couple of warning shots scaring off the bear. Then they helped me into the boat, gave me food and water and brought me back to my camp.  Amazingly my tent and canoe were undamaged but all my pots and pans were crushed and littered with puncture holes. They helped me pack everything up, gave me a pot and small pan to use and I went on my way.  Took me a good week to recover from that physically. Mentally I was pretty freaked out especially at night until I was far enough away from the coast. Finished that particular trip in Sioux Lookout 11/2 months later with some pretty amazing stories to tell..."

900025,Gallie,2015-02-24 21:35:00,1215,"I was fighting a decent sized pike on a canadian wiggler and when he jumped and spit the lure out it hit me square in the face, 1 treble pinched my eyelid to my cheek and the other was buried in my face below it. Im not a patient man and i proceeded to gently remove the eye hook by hand and had to use pliers for the one in my cheek. To this day it is rare to see me fish without shades. I got caught on simcoe outside of cooks bay in my tinny when a violent storm rolled through and barely made it back to shore. I have had several pike get my fingers at one point or another but a particularily bad one happened on a fishing trip when he got my whole thumb in his mouth and shook which shredded the skin and flesh right off, i wrapped that up and dealt with it at camp as best i could that night. When i lived in coldwater there was a smaller river up the road from me and i went through the ice, i was completely submerged and it took me close to 5 min to break the weaker ice away to climb out. I then had to walk almost a mile home which led to hours in the tub trying to keep frostbite and hypothermia away.  That may seem like a lot but ive got many more too, not to mention the stories i could tell of injuries and close calls to friends as well. Anyone who says fishing isnt a risky business at times is dead wrong. As long as you have water underneath you there is always the possibility of trouble.

900052,HTHM,2015-02-24 23:53:00,4082,"So the much anticipated weekend has arrived......I'm goin' up to the kawarthas to meet and greet some fellow OFC'ers. Big Cliff is first on the list. He sends me detailed directions....I have a GPS. Need I say more? Yes I do. I plug his address into the GPS, it finds it no problem at all. So up the 115\35 I go. I recall that I need to drive to the first light, la de da de da, I drive PAST the exit for 35 to Lindsay 'cause there is no light to be seen as of yet. When I get to the 7a exit I'm thinkin' (a rare thing for me), I didn't think I needed to drive all the way to Peterborough.....This is at 6:30 in the morning, Cliff said that he is up at 5 am every morning so I reluctantly decide to call. I wake up his wife, (an incredibly warm woman BTW), and she gets out of bed and goes to the top of the driveway into the shop and lets Cliff know that I need directions. (All of this time my GPS is telling me that I need to go back, but, NOOOOOOOO I know better because I remember the directions that Cliff gave me. Well to make a long story shorter, I managed to find his home, (nestled right on the shore of Sturgeon lake), and sat down to a coffee, while waiting for Beans, my fishing partner for the day. We laughed about my misadventures on the way up, and put that down to experience. Beans arrives, introductions are made, equipment compared, anticipation of a good day is in the air. The downpour had stopped, the sun was out, life is GOOD! So, off to the launch we go, the launch went smoothly, Beans is in my, (yet to be slimed), boat, with no trouble at all. I park the van and trailer, make my way to the boat, fire her up and help Beans into the dodge van captian's chair that I had mounted on the front bench seat of my 14' narrow beam boat. Now, a word about Beans.....Besides being one of the nicest and most worthy of respect men that I have had the pleasure of meeting, he is also an very experienced fisherman. He's gotta have 30+ years of experience on me. As well, he is a large man, in heart and goodnature as well as girth. OK here is the situation, an older, robust man sitting on a seat that is elevated 8 inches above the gunwales supported by a 10"" circular base fastened to a fiberglass bench seat . The base is 12"" high. Nothing wrong with that picture, right? So here we are on the lake; Beans has pulled in two perch, I am still waiting to get a bite. I ask Beans how he likes the seat, ""It is very comfortable"" he says. I am curious as this is the shakedown cruise with the new seat. I believe him and envy him as it does look very comfy. Beans leans back as he says this, and to my abject, unaldulterated, complete HORROR! he continues to lean back and back and into the drink he goes! I still have a vivid mental image of Beans' head entering the water, he completley upside down, still seated in the chair, legs kicking vainly in the air for some type of purchase, with a look of absolute shock and surprise etched into his face. Now at this moment in time I am thinking that I have killed him, he is going to drown, and it is my fault. So I do what any reasonable man would do, I panic. Thankfully he does not. Beans makes his way to the surface clutches at the side of the boat, and says something to the effect of "" That was interesting"", and I am thinking how the *(*%*)%((*#$%# am I gonna get him back in??????!!!!! Fortunatly there are two men nearby in a bass boat, I call them over and they CALMLY get us cooled off, well Beans was already cool, he was IN the water after all, and get Beans into a life jacket, haul him into their boat, and transfer him back to mine. They were the true heros of the situation, regretably we did not get their names. (So if you recognize this situation, and lurk the board, THANK YOU!!!!!!) If you are members here, stand and be counted. During all of this Beans is concerned for me, because he can see the huge impact that this has had on me. I am not doing well....Need less to say, that was the end of the outing.   And now the turnabout, ""cause that's fair play...  Old Ironmaker and I had arranged to hook up for perch last Saturday. We met at the appointed time in the appointed place, got introductions out of the way, transferred rods and tackle into his boat, and down the road we went. Destination Port Burwell. Upon arrival it was scene out of traffic nightmares...in the space used for 6 truck and trailer combo's there was 20, we get lined up to launch, enquire about minnows, none to be had. Well shucks we can't launch without bait, made inquiries and found that there were minnows available just down the road. So off the Port Stanley we go. The launch at Port stanley was amazing! Ten bucks to launch, and they have a young fellow to help with your bow lines, hold your boat, whatever needs to be done. We were very impressed by the service here. Minnows were 5 bucks a scoop and quite a few in a scoop as well. Down the river we go to the perching grounds. Two clusters of boat to choose from , we get to a respectful distance and anchor. While fishing for perch, (they were on smoulder but we did OK), it happens. The anchor rope wrapped around the locking latch and released the seat base. Base of the seat comes out, I fall backwards and perform a less than graceful backwards cannonball into the SIXTY TWO degree water. I can only imagine the look on my face as I tumbled over the edge of the boat. I felt my sunglasses slip of my face and start the downward journey to the bottom of erie. Made a feeble attempt to grab them, but missed due to the fact that I was more concerned with getting to the surface than saving my glasses. Make it to the surface, grab the gunnel and there was a conversation regarding getting back in boat, made my way to the back of the boat and climbed up the boarding ladder. Handy things i tell ya! Offers to return to shore are made, declined, squeeze out the water in my shirts and return to fishing. The ensuing conversation included a reference to this story, as I told Old Ironmaker about it and now, as a result, Norm can see turnabout comes to those that wait.  I still feel bad about what I did to you Norm, it was absolute foolish design on my part that put overboard. If this case it was a simple error in tie-off of the anchor rope. All's well that ends well, as they say."

It was worst bumpy ride to the shore on tailgate of tundra truck. Funny part that I was already going to my car with my limit when this happened."

You can ask any person who doesn't fish if they think fishing has its dangers and they will probably laugh.  Try putting that person in the middle of two fisherman in a boat throwing a double treble hook lure for 8 hours haha.  A lot of you dudes have been fishing a lot longer then I have so I got one question for you.  What's the worst fishing accident you have had?"

Wrong move. I was sent air borne. I had enough hang time in the air to look down at the console with the realization that the landing was going to hurt. The head hit the corner of the console, just missing my eye. A few stitches and stunned a little but back fishing the next opportunity I got."
899931,Joey,2015-02-24 03:58:00,9122,"I've had a hook or two in the hand  We had two near misses though.  First one was on Simcoe, out near Fox Island.  Sun was just coming up and Paul and I were casting in the Tracker.  A boat coming East towards us obviously didn't see us due to the sun coming up in his eyes.  He keeps getting closer and closer and finally Paul crouches down on the bow (he was working the trolling motor) and says duck.   The boat finally realizes we are there and does a sharp turn to the right and soaks us both.  Stops his motor and slowly drifts off.   He says ""Sorry.""   Paul yells back at him ""Sorry???  Sorry doesn't cut it buddy."" and they guy drives off at rapid speed.   If he had hit us straight on, I can't say what would have happened, but I bet it would not have been good.  The other time we were out at Bronte on Lake Ontario.  Clear weather, not a spit of wind, got the salmon rods out and started trolling.  All of a sudden a wind picked up and then it was game on.  We barely made it to shore and the bow of the boat was going under each wave as we hit it.  Paul told me to turn my seat around and not look up front.   I just hung on to the HS handle and prayed this was not my day to die.  We could not head straight to shore as the wind was coming from the wrong angle.  Once we got to shore, I actually kissed the pavement thanking God I was still alive!!"

However when we where kids  a friends younger brother tagged along and one time I cast without looking and he was standing right behind me. Buried the treble of my orange rapala right in the back of his skull. Jumped on our bikes and pedalled to the hospital...the whole way watching the orange rap swinging off the back of his head. They shaved a big bald spot on the back of his head and got the hook out in no time....so we pedalled back to our spot and continued fishing. I have no recollection of his parents coming to the hospital...the father worked in construction and was out of town and the mom was an at home mom with no car....I don't know if they where even contacted. I don't think that would be a hospitals procedure today.

Yup missed the boat and 99% of me went into the drink. The 1% that didn't, was my right big toe that was stuck through one of the D rings on the dock. After untangling myself and back on the dock, it wasn't hard to see that the toe was broke. It was like it was saluting the other toes on my foot. Here's the good part, this happened the second day of a 9 day stay at Eddie North's fly-in camp, on the Attawapiskat river. My brother and I had dreamed of a fly-in for years and there was no way I was letting this cut the trip short. I wrapped the toe tight against my foot with a cloth and black electrical tape. My brother has an open script for percocet; so I dove into his stash. A couple of percs, a couple shots of rye and I was good to go.  Dan."

My father tried to yank it out with pliers, but eventually ended up at the hospital. Had a muskie clamp down on my index finger when I was trying to unhook it. Ended up with  8 stitches. Also had 2 hooks on a treble imbedded in my wrist after I was trying to net a pike and the hooks let loose. Buddy had his rod loaded up, so it the lure came at me like a slingshot. It was not fun getting those out because of the way the skin was bunched up by the hooks. That was at the mouth of the French River Delta. Had to take a shaving razor apart to get the blades and then cut the hooks out. I always carry a surgical blade with me now."

We arrived on Friday at about 4:30pm and it had rained through the day on Friday and there was about an inch of water on the ice. Saturday morning, I was visiting another hut when my bud in our hut started yelling my two tip ups were going crazy. Running from one hut to the other, I stepped in a hole which had opened up due to the rain. My left ankle was shattered and I broke my left leg in three places between the ankle and the knee. Crawled back to my hut and waited for Floyd to check on us and get a lift into the Beaverton medical clinic. The Dr. said ""yep it's broken and you can either go to Orillia or drive back to London to have it fixed"". We arrived in London about 10:00pm and I had consumed TOO MUCH Canadian Club pain reliever for the surgery, so I had to wait until Sunday morning for everthing to get repaired. 30 years later and the ankle still swells up and I can tell it's going to rain about an hour ahead of time because the pins and screws in my ankle start to ache. Caught a few white fish though while I was waiting for Floyd and the Bombardier, which my wife enjoyed."
