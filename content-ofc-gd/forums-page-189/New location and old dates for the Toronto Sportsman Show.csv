901248,John Bacon,2015-03-03 20:10:00,3277,The 2016 Toronto Sportsman Show will be moving to the International Centre and going back to the old March dates.  I hope the new location allows them to drop the exhibitor fees enough to bring back some of the smaller players.  http://www.torontosportshow.ca/    
901268,Shloim,2015-03-03 21:47:00,515,Why do these shows make me feel like I'm paying to get in to a BPS store?
901280,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-03 22:16:00,937,"If by changing and moving dates make a better show, then I'm all down for it."
901304,John Bacon,2015-03-03 22:49:00,3277,Why do these shows make me feel like I'm paying to get in to a BPS store?  To each there own.  I enjoyed the show a lot more than I enjoy a trip to BPS.
901306,captpierre,2015-03-03 22:50:00,2521,Good move as far as I'm concerned
901364,bigugli,2015-03-04 00:24:00,6138,Glad to see it move back to the March break. The difference in vendor fees is not that great.
901415,Acountdeleted,2015-03-04 01:54:00,2562,Which one is the international centre again? Sadly this means they probably won't have the minimal ice fishing gear they had in the past.
901417,irishfield,2015-03-04 01:55:00,26272,Airport Rd and Derry Rd Jeremy.. free parking and easier access.
901421,4x4bassin,2015-03-04 02:00:00,1025,It's actually Airport Rd and Derry Rd . I know that's what you ment Irish . Great location and free parking like Irish said !
901425,irishfield,2015-03-04 02:06:00,26272,Man you type slow.. lol
901426,solopaddler,2015-03-04 02:11:00,8605,Great news!
901447,Acountdeleted,2015-03-04 03:07:00,2562,Oooooh. That one. I like that venue way better.
901451,kickingfrog,2015-03-04 03:19:00,8333,It still won't be the same without the smell of horses and retrievers.
901463,pics,2015-03-04 03:52:00,1268,I loved the old location but it was becoming too expensive to go so I welcome the change. Free parking saves at least $15 and you don't have to get near downtown...
901515,John Bacon,2015-03-04 14:18:00,3277,"It still won't be the same without the smell of horses and retrievers.  Yes, those were the days when the Horse Palace was used for the dogs shows and some other shows as well.  Too bad that they lost that."
901522,ratherboutdoors,2015-03-04 14:52:00,132,"I miss the old show; rode an elephant, saw that big bear from a movie, rodeo, eating lunch while watching the retriever trials, etc...  So much more than just shopping the newest gadgets."
901587,Handlebarz,2015-03-04 19:55:00,3790,Will have to see what there prices are like if its doable I will get a booth at that show to help support it abs see if it can get better. I know one of the bigges complaints I heard this year at the fishing and boat show about the other one was location and parking. Hope it will be better.
