900579,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-28 12:56:00,8243,"The biggest mistake the scientists did was name this CO2 thing ""Global Warming"" rather than ""Extreme Weather Phenomenon""  The bones and former muscles can no longer participate in the Winter sports, heck walking from the truck to the store is a chore now. There was a time we had a Sunday Hockey game on the lake every week when we had ice, Nordic Skiing, Cross country Skiing, snowshoeing up north, ice fishing and we even would break through the skim of ice at the local Marina with the boat to hit the warm water outflow at Nanticoke and of course Ice Fishing. I envy all you folks that can still do all that, especially as Seniors, good for you, I'm jealous too.  To keep busy we work on the boats in a nice heated Quanset hut. Almost have the 28 foot  Grew ready to put outside in the next few weeks then my StarCraft goes in and I will be changing the steering cable and replace some carpeting. Then the 23 foot Grew Cuddy goes in to mount a buddy's Stainless Downrigger platform and rod holders across the back. I just make sure Featherstone Ted has the shop nice and warm before heading over.  When I was at the plant I remember 92' and 93' we got a cold snap in November and it lasted until April. I called it the Winter Olympics. 52"" Baywater lines frozen solid, then 3/8 inch armor plate would split open ans send that water 40 feet in the air @ 90PSI and 2200 gallons a MINUTE. It would be a giant snow making machine. Frozen Blast Furnace and Coke Oven gas lines, when they thaw and split CO blowing everywhere, instrument air lines frozen, and, and, and. We used to start the Winterizing program the second week of December.  And to answer the question, yes this Winter will end just in time for next Winter is how I feel somedays. It's the first time we haven't gone south, with the additional health insurance and the exchange and service charges it's not in the budget. We are planning on taking that train excursion (CP Rail ) I think through the Rockies to BC this summer Our friends go down for 8 weeks and last week was the first time it hit 70F, poor Louis and Linda, I feel for them, not."

This year  their out of country health insurance was gonna cost them $8000 for 6 months so they had to stay home.  Their sure not enjoying their 1st Canadian winter since 1967 LOL"
900586,porkpie,2015-02-28 13:57:00,2521,"This winter has been relatively short.  Last winter started to suck the life out of me a little bit, but when I look at my shift calender and figure out just how few days of ice fishing I can squeeze in with famy obligations, this winter is starting to look shorter and shorter."
900590,Rich Clemens,2015-02-28 14:20:00,3131,It sure has been a long and cold one down here as well.  Longer cold stretches than normal. I think I'm ready t start cutting the grass again. I think Spring will be late again and really hose up the fishing for the musky opener.  No worries.  We'll have some good/close friends to spend the week with while we're up north - and we're looking forward to that.
900596,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-28 14:46:00,8243,"Yes Lou. One gets to a fair financial position and bam, health care for out of province costs kick in. The one and only reason Mom and Dad sold in Port Charlotte a few years after Dad turned 80. His health insurance wasn't all that bad after he turned 80. At 88 he takes one Statin a day for BP, bless him. Mom turned 80 and no way anyone I know could afford the 6K a month for Blue Cross Blue Shield. She can not go to NY for 1 day, 1 hour or 1 minute as I could not find any insurance provider to cover her. She is American and has missed many relatives funerals as of late. Long story. The 100K lifetime plan they have from Dad's retirement does not go far at a few thousand a day USD plus procedures etc. Lucky they sold before the real estate crash down in the US. The guy that bought it from them in 06' lost it in 08' and my cousin bought for 20 cents on the $ and far less than he paid for his new Dodge Ram. I can't believe the number of retirees that DO NOT get a primary payer beyond their company coverage. Both young and old.  My former business partner took 6 stitches to the noggin when we were down for a Conference and the bill came to $8000.00.  I was told we should get additional coverage for out of province. I'm not so sure about that."

This year  their out of country health insurance was gonna cost them $8000 for 6 months so they had to stay home.  Their sure not enjoying their 1st Canadian winter since 1967 LOL We tried to get health insurance for Sue so we could go down South for a few weeks this year. The best price we could get was over $1000.00 A DAY! Even then there were so many exclusions there is no way we could afford to take the chance.  As an alternitave, we just go away once a month for a weekend (in Ontario) Stay at a nice place (usually with a spa and a fireplace), eat what ever we want, and just pretend we are somewhere warm LOL."

Took me 2 hours of digging ice and snow to get to the thermostat, then realized it must be the breaker. Kept kicking out. Ran an extension cord to a plug, A OK. Today the sink won't drain, grey water bed frozen to the sink, can't wait until something splits. Dirty pots, pans and dishes everywhere. We are getting hammered tonight from the south and the north west 70K winds blowing last weeks snow everywhere. My wife has to work until midnight and has a 35 minute drive in June. She has the 4X4 but I don't think that will help. I don't know how bad it really is because every window and door has 3"" of snow on it and I can't see 10 feet out there. I'm thinking of driving to Caledonia and driving her home in the truck. If I get stuck in the front wheel drive Altima they will find me in April, I can see the headlines "" Missing idiot found in middle of bean field 2 months latter"" Looks like another 100 plus bucks for a motel room in Hamilton. No way she will ask friends to let her in at 1AM.  Oh well 20 some odd days to spring."

No matter what I just get cold and never catch fish  I am starting to wake up at nights from dreams about ice out laker fishing  In past years I have always dealt with the winter by living in hockey rinks 4-5 days a week but now my kids of aged out and one is off to college and the other will be going next year  This is how I have spent my winter so far I have finished the basement I redid my daughters room painted the entrance into the house I am now in them middle of a kitchen remodel which I hope to have done next week if my wife can ever pick the paint colours  for you other non ice fishermen what do you do to make it through the winter

Luremaking.com has some ways to spend an afternoon, no matter what your favourtite fishing method. As a few have said though it can be additive, and before you know it you have spinners and harnesses and jigs and spoons everywhere.

The rest of the time I'm either clearing the driveway or trying to think of excuses to not bother cleaning the driveway.
