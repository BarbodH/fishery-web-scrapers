900578,NAW,2015-02-28 12:46:00,4022,Right on man!  I was an FE Madill Mustang back in my day.  Wingham (and that area in general) was a great place to be raised!  Good on your for helping educate these kids.!
900583,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-28 13:32:00,8243,Fantastic work you are doing with our future stewards there Richard. Getting them involved in conservation at the grassroots level is paramount to our future fishery. I can't thank you enough.  Been 23 years since we fished around Wingham. Is the Ice Cream stand still there? I did some damage to my body with that great Ice Cream. Did some brain damage at the Legion too. I think we camped behind the Legion back then.  Thank you again.
900584,crappieperchhunter,2015-02-28 13:40:00,2582,Get them interested and involved...that's the way to do it. Great job for putting this all together. Thx for sharing.
