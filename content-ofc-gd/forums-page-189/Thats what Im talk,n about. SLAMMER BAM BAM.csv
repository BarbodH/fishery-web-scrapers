Went to a whitey spot, I went 3/3 and he went 5/6... most of them between 10am and noon. Crazy bite window. Smallest was around 4lbs, biggest 6.  I also caught a bonus beauty laker... on my ultralight perch rod... 4lb test... 10+ minute battle! Came in lust like a whitey on bottom... hovered... then SMASH game on!  I'll add some pics later.  Pete"

900909,Moosebunk,2015-03-02 05:51:00,3970,You won't forget this chunker on the wonky clunker reel.
901729,S.M.05,2015-03-05 15:01:00,145,Nice thick laker! Makes all the trips worth it when you stick it to one like that.
900649,misfish,2015-02-28 20:07:00,29133,"It was only a matter of time before I got my slammer bam bam going. Well not really,as I suck when it comes to hard water lakers. LOL  But right off the hop,the arcade chase game was on. The X4 Elite was lighting up. Dead stick a slammer at 80 fow and jig a spoon at the bottom in 93 fow. Probly had 5 chases that didnt hook up in the first half hour. Even had one chase from 80 all the way up to 20 and didnt connect. Could,nt figure out the retreive speed they were looking to attack at. Also couldnt believe they by passed the spoon and zoomed right up to the slammer. The next chase I figured just wait til he was on it,then burn it up. That was the ticket. That laker was on a mission and slam bam bam,he smoked it.  Bringing up this fish was a battle for sure. When it was at the 50 mark, my handle went wonky. The screw had come loose on the other side. So keeping tension on the fish,I was able to get it tighen up and get the fish to the hole. He had him self wrapped around the line a couple of times,so it was pretty intense trying to get him free of the wrap line and not lose him. It worked out for me. Get the head in the 24 inch thick ice hole and there was no where for him to go but out. After this one there were another 5-7 chases,but they just turned down.  What a blast.  27.""5  long.    "
