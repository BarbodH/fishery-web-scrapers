Was uncanny how those bass didn't even look at a typical retrieve. Yet when he slowed way down and either let the lure suspend, or better yet sink and then sit on the bottom, they were all over it. Add to that, you stay longer in the strike zone. Class act at the end answering questions Going to get back into Countdown Raps. Thanks Mike."
