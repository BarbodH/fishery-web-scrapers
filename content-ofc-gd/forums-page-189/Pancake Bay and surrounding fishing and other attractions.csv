900191,huzzsaba,2015-02-25 22:38:00,884,"I have booked a campsite at pancake bay Provincial Park this July.  I am really looking forward to this trip and hope to get some fishing done. Any suggestions on lakes in the area for fishing?  I read that Batchwana River may hold some fish and possibly some trout.  There are other lakes in the area, and I'm pretty sure there are fish, but would rather go where somewhere that is known to hold fish.  I will mainly be fishing from shore.   If there are other places worth visiting in the area, please do let me know.  its a good 10 hour drive so would like to see as much as possible during our visit.  Thanks"
900195,Joeytier,2015-02-25 22:46:00,3990,"Just about every river and creek from there north crossing the highway hold brookies, that alone could keep you busy the whole trip!"
900198,huzzsaba,2015-02-25 22:59:00,884,"Thanks for the reply.  Quick question, if I find a spot, is it ok to park the car on the shoulder and go down to the water since there will be no parking lot near these spots?  I have seen cars parked on the shoulders all the time near creeks and rivers, but was always unsure if it is a violation."
900216,pike slayer,2015-02-26 00:48:00,1177,Joey tier is correct. Just about every river from the sault to wawa and beyond will be holding fish. there is always parking along side the rivers some more sketchy then others for getting stuck. There are also lakes along side of the highway in the lake superior provincial park past pancake. Now if you were to bring a boat/canoe there are some good inland lakes in the area but aren't very fishable from shore. The trails in can also be sketchy and not very car friendly.

900288,Algoma Guy,2015-02-26 15:24:00,19,You have picked an awsome spot for a vacation!  Like worm dangler said a lot of the rivers will hold fish although July isn't the ideal time.  There are some popular spots along the highway that provide parking but you can park on the shoulder if you would like to explore too.  Send me a Pm if you would like and I can point you in the right direction.
900599,huzzsaba,2015-02-28 15:39:00,884,Thanks for the replies.  I will probably stick with Pancake river and at the most wander out to Batchawana river.  Any recommendations on one or two lures and bait that are good for brook trout?
900623,TDunn,2015-02-28 17:56:00,680,"Go to batch over the cake. Throw spinners, Cleos. July your gonna get brookies, smallies, resident bows and maybe walleye. Hope for some rain just before your trip.....  TDunn"
900773,huzzsaba,2015-03-01 17:27:00,884,"Tdunn,  you mean right at the mouth of the river on the south side of Batchawana Provincial Park?"
901630,TDunn,2015-03-04 23:26:00,680,"Hmmm not so much there for the trout. That's more up stream. Bass and Pike should be around tho. Never know what you will get at the mouth.... Check the regs if you plan on keeping some brookies. The superior tribs north have a 22"" slot for the most part.  Nothing can be kept under. Just a heads up  TDunn"
