901132,manitoubass2,2015-03-03 04:35:00,11391,Ill comment on this tomorrow. Its far more complicated
901137,Moosebunk,2015-03-03 04:46:00,3970,"I have just been diagnosed with tennis elbow, the only repetitive motions I do that could cause it are jigging. Man is it ever painful, makes brushing your teeth or holding a coffee mug difficult.  Anyone else ever have a similar fishing injury?  It can actually last for months.  Had it as well two winters back.  Using the hand auger for most of the season didn't help at all.  Called it auger elbow but there was plenty jigging going on that ice season too.  Last year on Slave with the week of lakers there it crept back and by weeks end was purdy sore on hooksets especially.  Your best defense after it goes away is to stretch and work-out your arms and build as much strength as you can in the supporting muscles.  Golfing is not your friend...  The joys of getting older. lol."
901145,Yellow Fever,2015-03-03 11:53:00,139,"As mentioned I get it so bad I cant lift a coffee....I have to go to physio 2-3  times a week for massage, acupuncture  and current....have to wear a  elbow band all the time now....takes forever to heal as mentio ed..might heal quicker if I quit playing hockey 2 times a week but???  It definitely will heal quicker with treatment other than the  peas and ice packs"
901147,Garnet,2015-03-03 12:08:00,2056,I'm sure Yellow has been shown the proper tension on arm bans.  To tight is just as bad as not wearing them. At the thickest point of your forearm just needs to be compressed a little bit. Get your therapist or pharmacist to show how to wear them.  Do all the things above but mostly rest.
901151,Acountdeleted,2015-03-03 12:20:00,2562,If they told me to ice it I would go ice fishing.  Feel better soon.
901154,bigugli,2015-03-03 12:51:00,6138,Last spring I buggered up the tendons in the wrist and forearm from all the casting and jigging I was doing. Spent a large part of the later spring and summer wearing a support. Even with the support there were a couple of days of jigging on Biscotasi that were brutal.
901001,Burtess,2015-03-02 16:59:00,901,"I have just been diagnosed with tennis elbow, the only repetitive motions I do that could cause it are jigging.  Man is it ever painful, makes brushing your teeth or holding a coffee mug difficult.  Have been told to ice it and rest it for 2 weeks..... This is going to be difficult as there is another month left of ice fishing season!!!  Anyone else ever have a similar fishing injury?  Burt"
901002,BillM,2015-03-02 17:01:00,17367,You sure that's from fishing?  lol
901004,Gerritt,2015-03-02 17:03:00,6129,My wife has it also....... Just sayin'  Never played tennis in her life  But seriously she does have it and uses a frozen bag of peas every once in awhile... Best u can do is let it heal.
901006,manitoubass2,2015-03-02 17:05:00,11391,"Haha bill.  Yep ice it up. Take some fish oil to increase healthy inflammation.  Stay away from NSAIDS if possible, they reduce positive and negative inflammation and that prolongs healing.  Tennis elbow can be a pita taking months to heal.  Jig (or tug lol) with the opposite hand.  RICE"
901008,Burtess,2015-03-02 17:12:00,901,Lol I was told by the guys at work to do the backhand jigging method for a while till it heals.  I'll get some ice on it tonight and see how it goes.  Burt
901010,manitoubass2,2015-03-02 17:16:00,11391, Then after 4 or 5 days alternate between ice and heat. Ice takes down the inflammation.  Heat promotes blood flow to the injured area.  Dont overuse that arm or its gonna take months to heal.  I cant see this being caused by jigging but who knows? Usually it would take more stress then that.  What did your dr say?
901028,Dave Bailey,2015-03-02 18:15:00,1641,"You sure that's from fishing?  lol  High school friend of mine got a badly sprained wrist when he slipped off the couch during some, uh, extracurricular activities. Since his paramour was a cheerleader, he called it a football injury."
901030,Headhunter,2015-03-02 18:19:00,5703,Run set lines... problem solved! HH
901034,MJL,2015-03-02 19:04:00,2427,A few years ago I got tennis elbow after a couple days of ripping bucktails for walleyes. Ice and rest for a couple of weeks and all is good.
901036,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-02 19:14:00,8243,"I as well was diagnosed with Tennis elbow. I told my Dr. I haven't played tennis in years, he said ""OK Fishing elbow then."" So I asked him for a RX for a downrigger.  But seriously baby it for a few weeks. I didn't and 25 years latter it still hurts under load. It hurts most swinging a framing hammer and golfing. I can not troll using my right arm to this day.  ICE= ICE/COMPRESSION/ELEVATION  Put it in a sling after you have iced it and wrapped it in a 6 inch Ace bandage. If not that inflammation may act up for the rest of your life."
901037,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-02 19:19:00,8243,I will ice for no more than 5 minutes every 4 hours. I've know guys that have actually gotten frost bite using ice from the freezer. Use medicinal frozen peas or corn.
901038,manitoubass2,2015-03-02 19:27:00,11391,"Use ice or a cold pack, but never directly on the skin. Always make sure there is a barrier, whether it be a piece of cloth or something else. Dont apply ice directly to skin"
901040,mitch seguin,2015-03-02 19:31:00,98,"Been there.  You can purchase an elbow velcro ice wrap.  Pluck it out of deep freeze and strap it down for your icing time.  When finished, throw it back in the deep freeze for your next session.  I brought mine to work to max out on the icing period.  I was advised 20 minutes on/off for the first few days."
901043,4x4bassin,2015-03-02 19:39:00,1025,"Had that injury a couple years ago and yes it was a PITA to heal . Could barely lift a coffee like you said . Took at least 4 months to heal properly (didn't rest it do to work and fishing ) Anyways I found ice helped it as well as one of those arm band things that they sell at the drug store designed for tennis elbow ! It wraps around the forearm just below the elbow providing support to the injured area . Go get one , they work . Some are better then others so its trial and error . Good luck"
901050,NAW,2015-03-02 20:12:00,4022,I know where you can get some ice...
901075,Burtess,2015-03-02 22:13:00,901,Back in the fall after a day bushwhacking steelhead I started to get numbness in the last three fingers on my left hand.  I figured I had banged my elbow and pinched a nerve or something.  On and off numbness continues until now.... and now it's pain on the outside of the elbow.  Doc said to ice it 3X per day and not to use it.  Going to be difficult as I drive a stick too so us both hands all the time.  I will pick up a brace and try that too.  Thanks for the advise!  Burt
901076,Garnet,2015-03-02 22:15:00,2056,I've controlled mine for 25 years by never fishing with out arm bans. Putting them on after pain starts is closing the barn door after the horse left.
901089,musky666,2015-03-02 23:20:00,126,Had the same thing- figured it was from trolling big baits and reefing ahead with left arm while driving boat. Went to physio- got acupuncture and shock treatment- along with exercises- worked really well. Got some back now though so gotta get on with the exercises again.
901096,manitoubass2,2015-03-03 00:12:00,11391, Sorry garnet I misread that... so I adjusted my post
901103,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-03 00:43:00,937,Thats what the injury is called.  I had a weird feeling at my elbow this fall and winter and it was my first time experiencing it.
901109,manitoubass2,2015-03-03 01:07:00,11391," Ive had it twice and its not fun, almost as bad as planter fasciitis which is like walking on broken glass for months on end)  And it can last a long time"
901114,Raf,2015-03-03 01:46:00,3495,"had a bout with golfer's elbow (no I dont golf, likely got it from poor form lifting weights), very similar to tennis elbow but it affects the inside of the elbow as opposed to the outside.  took a long time to heal.  i went to a sports therapist who performed ART (active release technique) and that seemed to help considerably."
901115,manitoubass2,2015-03-03 01:57:00,11391,Same way I got tennis elbow. It was either too wide of a grip on barbell curls or from tricep pull downs. (Or both)
901121,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-03 03:47:00,8243,"There was a significant increase in weight training in the early 70's. There were very few gyms and even less individuals who knew what they were talking about. A strength coach for any sport had not yet been invented. If you looked at a common work out from the 70's you would cringe. You learned how to lift by reading Joe Weiders articles in magazines low reps with massive loads. Now that I'm 60 my joints are bone on bone, there are hairline stress fractures in almost every large joint. Was it from lifting heavy? Maybe. Lifting wrong, most likely.  It wasn't only the 70's that we did things wrong. In the 90's 2 of the worlds best golfers swore by weight training, no one in golf had ever trained their bodies with heavy weights. One was David Duval the second is Tiger Woods, neither are playing today on tour. Neither are 40 yet."
901128,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-03 04:23:00,937,"If it was tennis elbow youd know it. Super annoying pain non stop from just doing simple little things.  Ive had it twice and its not fun, almost as bad as planter fasciitis which is like walking on broken glass for months on end)  And it can last a long time   Thanks for clearing that up.  I had planters foot at one point and that was horrible...I remember suffering for a month before I got it checked out.  I even remember trying to go to the gym and combat this pain on the treadmill."
