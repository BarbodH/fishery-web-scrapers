Lloyd took the last fish crisp I had in the cupboard last week... added some cracker flakes for chicken coating that Leah had in there, some flour from the can and various spices to make the minimal ingredients we had on hand to stretch and cover enough fillets for the four of us to eat one night out of the deep fryer. Was delicious... not quite as good as TJ's secret recipe, but if I shared that I'd be blacklisted further than I already am!"

900820,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-01 22:42:00,8243,Have to mention our monthly fishfry of last summers perch and Pickerel I used crunched up cheezy Ritz crackers as coating and it turned out really well. We cooked up about 2 pounds of rather large Pickerel cheeks and that was a very special treat. I had a cheek burger with a slice of cheddar and a dollop of Tarter to die for.
900822,Bill Shearer,2015-03-01 22:49:00,456,My error! Reverse the order of the egg wash and the dry combo mix. It's been a while since I've fried anything! Damn doctors orders! But if I last longer then all is well.
900825,Gerritt,2015-03-01 23:15:00,6129,Did they have a run on Ritz crackers?
900827,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-01 23:18:00,8243,The way I look at the fried food thing is this. The great benefits of eating that oh so good for you fish far out weighs the bad of frying it in bread crumbs or flour based coating. So I'll call it a wash. That way I can have that double Big Mac as long as I eat a Yogurt in the morning and try and burn 1000 calories during that day.

It is all in ones perception.  If want to lower the glycemic hit just use brown rice flour with a bit of corn starch or corn meal with seasoning, to dredge, then the eggs and in the rice flour mix again. It is lighter tasting and lets the flavour of the fish come through. I make a gluten free mix this way and it works on chicken, pork chops and fish quite well. The trick is to coat and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to let the breading set."

The amount of moisture in the onion is going to make adhesion of the breading more difficult than fish or chicken.  I do make onion rings by soaking the rings in buttermilk overnight in the fridge. Drain the buttermilk off in a sieve coat with.  3/4 cup of flour 1/4 cup cornstarch 2 tbsp corn meal for crunch optional 1 tbsp lawrys seasoning salt  Refrigerate for 30 minutes then fry, if you don't refrigerate them coated it doesn't stick nearly as well."

The fish crisp in the first coat will give you the flavor, the powdered saltine crackers will give you a light crunch coating.  NOBODY mentioned the most important step you MUST do when use a dry mix breading!!!!  After you have it coated let the coating set and rest by layering in between wax paper and chilling for at least a half hour in the fridge. Doing this will change the way you think about dry mixes vs batters as a coating for fish. You will get a crisper more evenly browned product even using 3/4"" of oil in a skillet.

900794,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-01 19:13:00,8243,"There are so many batter and dry recipes I don't think I will live long enough to try them all.  Culinary experts always use these 2 rules of thumb for the crispiest frying. Dry, wet, dry. You fill in the ingredients. The other is to have whatever you are frying at room temperature and pat as dry as possible before coating.  I was turned on to Japanese Panko crumbs years ago but could never find then in grocery stores, I finally found them in an Asian grocery store in Hamilton. Most big box grocery stores regularly stock them now. Panko is double baked which results in a crispy result. Panko does well in a Microwave as someone already mentioned.  Big Cliff your recipe calls for 1 cup of flour per pound of fish. My Diabetes specialist would ring my neck if I ate a cup of white flour for one meal. And my head would probably explode.

In another bowl add oil to water then pour into a well in the dry ingredients. Beat until well blended and smooth. Makes enough for about 1 kg of fish.  Pat the fillets dry, dip them into the batter, drain off any excess and deep fry until golden.  Over the years I have tried a lot of different batters, some pre made, beer batters, you name it. This one is a beautiful, light batter (but you can make it much thicker if you want, just cut back on the water).  Of all the ones I have ever tried this one is by far my favorite. You can add onion powder, garlic powder, or just about anything your heart desires to it if you want but I really like a light crisp batter that seals in the flavour and moisture of the fish, this one does that for me."
