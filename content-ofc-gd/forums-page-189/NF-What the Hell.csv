I honestly don't think so cause after the ruling last Friday that he was allowed to travel out of the hospital he will be the most monitored person in Canada.  I doubt the hospital will say ""Ok Vince we will see you tomorrow.  Enjoy your trip to Winnipeg"".  Hopefully they have a system in place where he can be watch by either a nurse or doctor while taking his medication at his specific times.  Still don't agree with the whole ruling."

You would not want to know with how I believe we should deal with violent offenders LOL.  That being said the situation with criminally insane people is different for one major reason. They don't do time in jail because they are ill, they get to be treated for their illness. As soon as they are deemed not to be ill they can be released back into society, because they were never guilty the ""illness"" was. That release comes because a doctor or panel of doctors says that they are safe to be out in public again.  I just think the doctors should be personally invested in that decision....

901491,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-04 07:26:00,8243,"I whole heartedly agree that mental illness is an illness that may or may not be treatable. My uncle suffers from Alzheimer's, my 87 year old father does not understand it. He thinks his brother has a choice. I tried to explain he has a broken brain, his response is ""it's all in his head!"" Our health care professionals that are responsible for this mans release should, as some here have said, be tied to their decision for the lifetime of their patient. What we have here is a prime example of responsibility without accountability.  The litmus test here should be if the physician is confident enough to release the patient he should be confident enough to have that patient as a house guest for a period of time. And his or her children or grand children will be staying in the same home for the duration. Then lets see what they decide to do with them. The utter degree of horror that went along with this murder has brought this case notoriety and international attention. These types of homicides occur regularly, dead is dead. Not with such horrible post-mortem acts but dead is dead. But they will garner a few columns on page 4, maybe. I will chip in a few extra tax bucks myself to keep him behind bars to ensure he takes his meds. Or the cost could be offset by releasing a few hundred marijuana offenders from our prison systems or deport a few non Canadians to their home land where they don't want then either.  There is no cure, only treatment. At the least he should report daily to a clinic where they watch him take the meds to control his admitted insanity. Maybe that would be inconvenient for him. I don't know if it was here on OFC but I read a comment that says what I think well. "" The liberals idea of being tough on crime is longer suspended sentences."""
901495,Sandbag,2015-03-04 11:50:00,533,"Over the last number of years our governments have attempted to save money in the health care field by attempting to treat people with mental illness in the community as opposed to hospital treatment.  While this sounds good in theory as being more humane than inpatient treatment, unfortunately people with mental illness do not always believe that are ill and often stop taking the medications prescribed to control their particular condition.  Now when this person reaches the crisis stage because they havn't taken their medication, their contact is with first responders being police, fire or ambulance attendants. I also believe this is the reason there are so many more letal confrontations with first responders in the community now.  I would never want to label someone suffering with a mental illness as criminal, but surely there has to be some safeguards for the community before someone like the accused from the Greyhound bus is released back into the community.  I can't imagine being a member of his family hearing this person will be back in the community.  Cheers  Craig"
