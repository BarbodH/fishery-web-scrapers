901087,Joey,2015-03-02 23:17:00,9122,"We had planned on fishing with JP Bushey today, but his toddler got sick and he had to cancel (hope he's okay now JP).   So we did our usual BBP fishing and the wind was extremely out of hand.  So much more than the weather network and news said it was going to be.  I even looked on my iphone as I braced myself in my hut hoping it did not tip over and it said 34 kph, but I'd bet it was at least 50 kph and gusting higher.  I took a quick video with my phone as we were packing up.   There are other huts out there, but you can't see them because of the ""snow devils"" that were all around.   Kind of cool to see.  No fish to be had though    We did mark them and had some small chases, but no takers!!!  "
901090,Terry,2015-03-02 23:22:00,14456,wow you guys are brave out there  in that wind
901091,motv8tr,2015-03-02 23:27:00,2587,Yup a wee bit of a breeze out there.
901092,irishfield,2015-03-02 23:28:00,26272,"Jesus.. it must be windy, Paul's wearing gloves!"
901105,Joey,2015-03-03 00:46:00,9122,"Jesus.. it must be windy, Paul's wearing gloves!  Yup, he's not a glove man"
901177,SirCranksalot,2015-03-03 14:39:00,3291,We were hunkered down in a pop up on Lake Joe. I went outside and drilled a second hole but didn't get back to it with my rod for a few minutes. By then I couldn't find the hole!    According to Env Can there were gusts to about 40 kph.
901235,misfish,2015-03-03 18:51:00,29133,Gusts to 50 here in Barrie.  Sorry ya didn't get any hook ups J.  This coming weekend looks prime again.  I cant believe Im waiting til the end of the season to get my first white fish again.

I cant believe Im waiting til the end of the season to get my first white fish again.   We will be out there B. Paul took the week off so we can go any day we want really.   Yesterday was a disaster and today they called for 30 to 35 K winds up there.   We're having quite the snowstorm right now and I just walked Ralphie and it's very slippery out there.   Almost fell on my tush several times.   I caught nothing last year and so far nothing this year, so I'm just hoping for a laker or two (no, not the beer LOL).  I hear shallow is the way to go right now from several different people."
901241,BillM,2015-03-03 19:32:00,17367,"Shallow for sure if you want whities Joey, they are in there chowing down on gobies."
901276,blaque,2015-03-03 22:09:00,2419,"looks lonely out there...........  The funny part is, your videos autoplayed.......and after the ice video, i saw your frenchy rubbing his itchy butt on a poor pink toy of some kind LMAO"

901329,Moosebunk,2015-03-03 23:34:00,3970,"I was gonna say the same Blaque.  Wouldn't want to be handling that toy and playing fetch too often with it.  Scuzzy wind.  Chillin is fine, but wind chillin always blows."
901340,Joey,2015-03-03 23:48:00,9122,"Trust me, he has the cleanest butt on earth.   I need to buy shares in Huggies baby wipes     They're making a killing off me"
