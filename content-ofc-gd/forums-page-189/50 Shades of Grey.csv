A few days before the group’s annual departure date, John’s wife puts her foot down and tells him he is not going. John’s fishing buddies are very upset that he can’t go, but what can they do? Two days later the three get to the camping site to ﬁnd John sitting there with his tent set up, ﬁrewood gathered, and dinner cooking on the fire, drinking a cold beer. “Heck John, how long you been here, and how did you talk your missus into letting you go?” “Well, I have been here since last night. Yesterday evening, I was sitting in my recliner when my wife came up behind me, put her hands over my eyes, and asked, ‘Guess who?”‘ I pulled her hands off, and there she was, wearing a nightie. She took my hand and pulled me into the bedroom, where she’d lit candles and put rose petals all over the place. Well, she’s been reading ’50 shades of Grey’…. On the bed she had handcuffs, and ropes! She told me to tie her up and cuff her to the bed, so I did. And then she said, ‘Do whatever you want.‘ So, boys, here I am!"
