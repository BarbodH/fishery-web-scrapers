900258,Mister G,2015-02-26 12:55:00,1429,"Visited a Cabelas in South Carolina this morning and while it wasn't a monster store (Michigan and Pennsylvania have those), it was noticeably larger than the Barrie store. Seemed to have same depth but wider. Fishing and hunting depts were WAY bigger. Everything else looked the same. The Cave had some decent stuff, more than the Barrie location at least. I agree, the Hamburg, PA store is AWESOME that has 3 restaurants in it to give you a prospective on how large it really is (265,000 sq feet) compared to the new sized down stores that are now all under 90,000 sq feet. Cabela's has decided all their newer stores now will be the down sized store so they can expand to more markets across North America.  And for those who keep using the term ""Big Box Store"" when referring to Cabela's couldn't be further from the truth. They all are themed stores that have vaulted ceilings and outdoor/hunting/fishing decor to the max. A big box store is like a Walmart as it's just a huge store contained in a box like exterior. Many of you mom and pop stores could be described as small box stores.  We all have our own preferences when it comes to shopping for whatever, and that is the way it should be to keep prices as low as possible. Without that competition our prices would be much higher on our adult toys."

I've been to 6 different stores in the US, and while I've enjoyed the experience each time, I'd say my combined spending of all those visits is considerably less than $500.00. Store prices are simply too expensive. I, like most of you, are looking for a complete line of whatever it is I'm looking to buy. For instance, if it's a rod, I want to be able to look at a variety of similar rods, including brands I know, before making my decision. I want to look at customer reviews, I want to feel like I'm getting a deal (I almost never buy unless it's a sale), I want it delivered promptly, and I want excellent customer service if I have a question or problem. In fairness to Cabelas, through their on-line shopping they deliver on most of the above quite regularly, certainly better than most of their competitors, albeit not as well as they did a few years ago.  I don't need 200 catalogs delivered to my house every year, and that may actually be understated, and I definitely don't need or want a hard bound catalog. I honestly don't think one of those catalogs has ever influenced a buying decision for me, and I have tried to opt out of the catalogs before, it doesn't seem to work.

It was a sad day when they closed... I have $100 in BPS gift cards that I have had for well over four years! I haven't been there in that time and have no interest in making the trip...

If they didn't have something it probably didn't exist. I walked out of there with a shotgun I bought my brother for Christmas around 73, didn't even ask my name.  This topic has been discussed before but that's all good there are many new members here since then.  BPS on line is all in US funds, I went all the way to the 400 to pick up 2 trolling rod combos and was told the price was in US funds, come on man.  I was on the Sail site just yesterday, the worst search engine I have used.  I'll stick to our local shops. The only big box store I do frequent is Canadian Tire in Dunnville. It always has a well stocked fishing section with tackle specific to the Grand River i.e. Hot N Tots and deep water minnow baits for Erie. They always have a bin of rod and reel combos on sale. Buddy scored a Rappala line counter combo spooled with braid for 75 bucks at CTC and I bought my wife a medium light Rappala combo that is perfect for perch here for $19.99. I told her it was hers."

HOWEVER, you will never get all those things you listed AND always get the lowest price from the same retailer.  I don't find Cabela's lacking in anything I need. They might not have it at your local Cabela's store but a simple click of the mouse and  you can order it and have it shipped to that store for FREE. It don't get no better then that. And no one, I repeat NO ONE has better customer service in the retail industry then Cabela's in my experience. But I do agree they are not a bottom bargain price store anymore.  NO store will always have everything you need on the shelf no matter what kind of store it is. At least that has been my experience.  As far as the constant catalogs that keep coming weekly or 2-3X a week.........that was my biggest whine for Cabela's........so about 4-5 years ago on Cabela's forum site I brought that up to a Cabela's forum administrator and he took down my info and the catalogs did not all go away but now only get one maybe a month and I no longer get that hard covered book that comes shipped wrapped in cardboard."

At that time, we always had two people in the department during weekdays, and usually 3 (more around Thanksgiving and Christmas) on weekends. In addition, you could not work in many departments (fishing, fly fishing, guns, archery etc) without a pretty extensive background in it.  In fly fishing, we had every type of gear imaginable. You could very seldom come in looking for something and not find it. WE had fly fishermen from several states and ONtario that came to our department regularly. THat was only a few years after the Cabelas brothers sold out and went public.  Then, things started to change. THey started eliminating positions for several seasoned outfitters, then hired them back at lower pay. THe purchasing was all centralized in Nebraska. IE...they bought merchandise for all stores, not individually based upon what type of outdoor sport was biggest in a certain locale. THey also cut way back on specialty merchandise, which affected the fly fishing department greatly. To my knowledge, there was no regional to store specific purchasing. For example, many of our customers fished MIchigan's famous Au SAble River. A book written by the (now) late Rusty Gates on the Au Sable would have sold like hot cakes o=in out department. Rusty was/is damn near considered a god to Au SAble and Michigan fly fishers. I tried to get the book in the store. It was turned down, because we couldn't guarantee a certain number of books sold. Another example....a lure called the Golden Nugget is one of the most famous lures used in Lake ERie walleye fishing going back to the 60's. Cabelas in Dundee did not stock them, yet they host a walleye tournament on Lake Erie annually.  Also, during my 2 year tenure, there seemed to be as much emphasis on outfitters selling Cabelas Visa cards as outdoor merchandise. Now they push warranties....why would anyone buy a warranty on a fly rod that comes with manufacturer warranties from 5 to 25 years. When I go to Cabelas now, there is one person in fly fishing, and their stock is maybe half what it used to be. THe department itself has never been busy when I've been there. Also, there seem to be more part time workers, many younger, who really don't have the experience in some of these areas (IMO).  Very sad...it used to be a special place t go to, and to work. I think going public resulted in the way it is today, and, from what I heard, a lot of management hiring from big retail --- K Mart etc.  Sorry for the rant.  That's a sad tale, bigcreekdad.  It really shows that when companies go public, their service to their customers dwindles.  It also is usually worse for employees, who have to do more work because there is less of them( and thefore have less time to spend with customers ).  Sure publicly traded companies are focused on their customers, as long as you understand that those customers are their shareholders.    ."

I've never been in a Cabelas store but had always heard great things about the American branches and most say their far better than BPS. I'm a long ways from the new Barrie store but had planned on taking a drive over there just to see it but since it's opening last year I don't think I've heard a single good thing about it on this board so it looks like I'm gonna take a pass on the visit.  Thanks for the heads up boyz.

899761,BillM,2015-02-23 14:23:00,17367,"Add me to the 'I think I'll just go to Canadian Tire in Barrie' club. Stopped by Cabela's once, definitely disappointed.  Do you enjoy the higher prices at Canadian Tire better? lol!  The south end store it out to lunch on their lure prices.  First time I've seen a $18 Rapala."
899769,porkpie,2015-02-23 14:45:00,2521,"I shop at canadian tire a lot.  Closest place to me with a little bit of everything, including tackle.  If I want to buy something I just take my iPhone in with the lebarons catalogue loaded up and price match plus I get 10 percent back in ct money.  Sometimes they whine a little, but they always do it.  They don't have everything a lebarons carries though, but you csn easily get an $18 rapala marked down.  Plus they often clear stuff out.  I just picked up some $20 sebiles for $5.  Yep, I like CT!"

899771,buick14,2015-02-23 15:03:00,741,Ya normally I look at the prices at CT and laugh when it comes to fishing stuff.....I have also seen some pretty stellar blowouts on lures also so I always swing by and look when I go.  Didnt know about the price match thing though....I guess Im gunna go in with my catalog from le baron and point out all the over priced husky jerks they've got....Still can't believe how cheap huskies are at le baron for the hj12-14

Of course it depends on what you're buying. Then again, I'm not the type to sweat spending two or three extra bucks a few times a year. If I was that worried, I could certainly find other areas to make that up.. So what do you want? Lousy selection where you might find something similar to what you want for a 'great price', or just go and spend the two or three dollars and get what you want? Canadian Tire certainly doesn't have an endless selection, but it's better than Cabela's. I could also drive to Bass Pro Shops, but then I'm down those few bucks you're saving in order to pay for gas."
899776,OhioFisherman,2015-02-23 15:51:00,6623,"It's been a long time since I went up north to Ontario, but even back in the 1960's your tackle prices were scary compared to prices here. At some of the smaller tackle shops here you also had the same problem though, sticker shock!  I used to make an annual early spring trip with friends to Cabela's in Dundee and BPS in Auburn Hills, no complaints, but I knew what I was looking for and kept my purchases mostly limited to those items.  Golden Nugget? Not a bad walleye lure, but the Erie Dearie was a lot more common in stores and tackle shops here along the lakefront, and usually cheaper! Overload? You also had the Storm Hot'n tot Pygmy spins and some others as I recall?  Once you got 15 - 20 miles of the lakefront the tackle selections in some stores changed radically, it just wasn't profitable to stock tackle that didn't sell well in the area."
899781,Acountdeleted,2015-02-23 16:19:00,2562,"If you are in Barrie or are making the trip, take the extra time and go to Trombleys in Orillia. They have some lures there I hadn't seen anywhere else in about 15 years.  Out of the big box stores I find myself going to Sail more and more. Sometimes BPS is good too."
899798,jimmer,2015-02-23 18:54:00,2730,"So, is Cabelas going to go the way of Target??? Out of touch with their consumers?"
899804,woodenboater,2015-02-23 19:16:00,2277,"Visited a Cabelas in South Carolina this morning and while it wasn't a monster store (Michigan and Pennsylvania have those), it was noticeably larger than the Barrie store. Seemed to have same depth but wider. Fishing and hunting depts were WAY bigger. Everything else looked the same. The Cave had some decent stuff, more than the Barrie location at least."
899806,dave524,2015-02-23 19:29:00,4508,"My experience with Cabelas goes back to the mail order from the US back in the late 80's, at that time I felt they  catered to the hunting and fly fishing market as opposed to Bass Pro who were more true to their name. Outfitting for a horseback hunt in the Idaho back country, Cabelas was hands down the best store or Montana blue ribbon river fly fishing trip , again Cabelas was the place. Back in the 70's , early 80's we had the "" Outdoor Stores "" , oldtimers will remember  them."

899826,Sinker,2015-02-23 21:31:00,8692,"I miss tightlines. They were awesome!!  I have no time for the big box shops. I went to lebarons in Mississauga for the first time this weekend, just because I was in the area, and I spent about $30. They didn't have what I needed. My local guy down the road (BJ's Bait and Tackle) has it all every time......and I can go in and spend an hour just shooting the bull over a cup of coffee if I want. I can also call him and make arrangements for a late/early pick up of bait, or order pretty much anything I might need, whether its fishing tackle, boat supplies/parts, trailer supplies/parts.....screw the big box stores, they got nothing on the smaller shops.  S."
899828,lew,2015-02-23 21:41:00,12766,"I miss tightlines. They were awesome!!  When I lived in the city I did most of my shopping at JB's out in Etobicoke mainly because they carry the best selection of musky gear, but when I was travelling up to the trailer north of Peterboro and needed any other gear I always stopped in at Tightlines.  Good selection of stuff and John and the crew were great guys to just yak with."
