901262,Raycaster,2015-03-03 20:58:00,528,Tired of my crappie pontoon going sideways on me when loading. Last year I made 2 guide bars and welded to back of trailer but had a little mishap...  When I was in Fenelon Falls I stopped at a Marina and noticed they had nice adjustable guide bars on the new model pontoon trailers. I asked inside and they had them in their catalog but it was end of season so I thought I'd wait.  Any chance they are available to order in Canada?    
901266,DRIFTER_016,2015-03-03 21:35:00,10439,Something like this?  http://www.amazon.ca/C-E-Smith-Pontoon-Post-Guide-On/dp/B000A87848  Lots more options if you order from the states though.
901472,Sinker,2015-03-04 04:19:00,8692,Take those pics to a welding/fabricating shop with your pontoon on the trailer and I bet they could rig it up for ya.  S.
901496,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-04 12:03:00,8243,"I have everything you would need to make a pair if you look at the image from Drifter. The upper back of a steel patio chair complete with 90 degree bend cut in 1/2. A few feet of 1.5 "" PVC, duct tape and 2 caps. A good metal blade on a Sawzall, 4 ""C"" clamps and you are good to go. The tubing on the patio chairs I have slated for a spring yard sale is actually square tubing, perfect. Even round tubing will work with a few tweaks. 4 ""C"" clamps don't come anywhere near the $159.00 they want, nuts. I don't know where you are Raycaster but the chair is yours if you want."
901504,DanD,2015-03-04 13:21:00,2223,Go to any automotive exhaust shop; they'll have the tubing and can put the 90Â° bend in it. I wouldn't think it would cost you any more than 20 or 30 bucks; then finish it off as ironmaker has suggested. That's what I made a set of boat guides out of; the 20 gauge tubing was more than strong enough. Dan.

901616,Raycaster,2015-03-04 22:23:00,528,Thx guys for the ideas.  Last year I basically cut some angle iron (From a old bed frame) rust painted and enclosed it with pvc tubing with cap and welded it on. Looked clean and professional and worked great except for a little mishap at the Mitchel Bay Marina.  I'm in the Hamilton area and I'm the last guy to open his wallet but the idea of simple u-bolts for adjustment and not having to bug for welding favors is appealing this time.  I'll keep a look out and maybe give the marinas a call.
