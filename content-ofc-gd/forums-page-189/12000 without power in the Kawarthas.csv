900633,Big Cliff,2015-02-28 19:26:00,6899,"Just heard from a friend that there are about 12000 without power in the Kawarthas. He tried to find out from Hydro when it would be back on but hasn't been able to get an answer yet.  If you know anyone in the area that needs a generator, I have a 6500 watt one sitting here ready to go and will loan it to anyone that needs it but unfortunatly I can't deliver it, my trailer is frozen into the ground. I will help deliver it and set it up and I have two full cans of gas, just replace what you use.  If you know someone that needs it please call me cell # 705-928-8899, it is going to be a cold night."

900636,lew,2015-02-28 19:38:00,12766,"Powers good over here Cliff but if needed, Mr. Generac has my back."
900637,Fisherman,2015-02-28 19:43:00,7201,Must have been Mike Harris again.   Damm cold weather to have the juice freeze up.
900639,Big Cliff,2015-02-28 19:47:00,6899,"You sir are the greatest! can we nominate Cliff for the order of Ontario! No my friend, just doing what almost any other member of OFC would do, offer to help someone in need. We all do what we can, that is what makes this place so special."
900641,woodenboater,2015-02-28 19:54:00,2277,friend in Beaverton is doing fine thanks to Generac  3 hours so far
900644,ketchenany,2015-02-28 19:58:00,3229,"Cliff when it comes to help, YOU are at the top of the pile! BTW I'd do the same. I live on a street with a lot of older couples (70+) and when it snows I take care of their needs.  I believe we're are here for a short time why not do what we can.  Crystal clear here in Woody BTW. Bought a Genny last year and haven't started it yet  Going to hardwire it to the house this spring."

You have to understand; ANY time I have ever needed help in anyway with anything, members of this community have been here so fast and helped so much it was overwhelming at times. It is an honor and a pleasure to be able to do something in return!"
900648,lew,2015-02-28 20:05:00,12766,"friend in Beaverton is doing fine thanks to Generac  3 hours so far  Our power has gone out 4 or 5 times this winter and it sure is nice to know that within about 10 seconds Generac automatically kicks in and my house is running normally again and with a 1500 litre propane tank I'm good for a long time.  Half the homes on this road have them and we stay nice and warm while the other half waits in the cold and dark for power to be restored.  I've said it before, but it's some of the best $$$$ I've ever spent."
900660,Sinker,2015-02-28 20:47:00,8692,All good at my place.  S.
900667,woodenboater,2015-02-28 20:53:00,2277,quick question for you Lew (and anyone with a Generac). Obviously it would depend on size but I'm curious if they're safe from being most five finger discounters. Will they need lots of manpower to haul away ? Just looking down the road and exploring options.   tia

Just looking down the road and exploring options.   tia  Like anything else, I spose if someone wanted it bad enough they could take it. Took several guys to unload it from the truck and set it up so a few guys could definitely take it. They'd have to disconnect the plumbing too but that's not a big deal either.  They'll steal the roof off your house if they want it bad enough LOL  "
900693,woodenboater,2015-02-28 22:39:00,2277,"thanks Lew. I've seen some Generacs and always wondered about security. My acreage is pretty safe and far enough away from town to discourage people. Also there are enough decent neighbours around with eagle eyes.  Basically I'm looking at options between bringing in the grid, solar or a Generac. or a combo of solar and Generac"
900695,Fisherman,2015-02-28 22:43:00,7201,"Basically I'm looking at options between bringing in the grid, solar or a Generac. or a combo of solar and GeneracIf  If I was a bunch younger, I'd strap some panels to the south wall.  They have some great new Li Ion batteries now, fast recharge and high capacity."
900701,woodenboater,2015-02-28 23:14:00,2277,"Funny you mention Li Ion batteries. While in SC, stopped by booth of a manufacturer of Li Ion batteries and they were fairly spend but will need to look at specs to see if they're the Holy Grail. Think Total sells them up here.  Back on topic, has power come back for those affected ?"
