900676,manitoubass2,2015-02-28 21:05:00,11391,Well I fish alot lew.  Id rather pay once up front then numerous times down the road.  Do it right the first time lol.  Ive saved for this for along time so....
900677,manitoubass2,2015-02-28 21:06:00,11391,"Ill have to look that up, doesnt sound familiar?  Def game for a beer and a chat!"
900678,cowanjo,2015-02-28 21:07:00,249,Take a look at musky first often the rods you will want 86 minimum my opinion will come up - don't go any shorter - I like the big nasty and sling blade I have winch on sling and tranx on nasty.
900679,manitoubass2,2015-02-28 21:11:00,11391,"Darn. I was gonna wait but im so tempted to order lol.  Thanks for all the advice!  Ill be honest i love walleye and bass and pike, i just need a new thrill"
900692,Raf,2015-02-28 22:38:00,3495,those will become dinner fish and offseason fish  8'6 is good for most baits. i prefer a 7'6 for jerkbaits though  dependns how tall you are and whether you fish off the front or back of the boat
900697,lew,2015-02-28 22:49:00,12766," 8'6 is good for most baits. i prefer a 7'6 for jerkbaits though  dependns how tall you are and whether you fish off the front or back of the boat  I agree Raf, shorter rods work better for jerk / twitch baits  My preference is 7' with a 7000 Abu"
900700,Andy,2015-02-28 23:05:00,330,"Musky Hunter is on WFN at 2 pm on Saturdays. The same episode will be aired again during next week, I can't remember the day and time off hand. Most of the show Jim was throwing Cowgirls and Bill was throwing  a crank bait that looked like a Big Game twitch bait in white perch. They were throwing at the shoreline and they talked about the usual stuff like weeds, weed lines and points. A number of fish were caught after prolonged figure 8s. It was unbelievable how many times they had to go around for a couple of the fish they nailed. Water was stained pretty good."
900703,Fisherpete,2015-02-28 23:28:00,1814,You will want a big rod for the Tranx... Like cowanjo mentioned it pairs very well with the 9' St. Croix Big Nasty. $400 though...

900718,Handlebarz,2015-03-01 01:17:00,3790,Same here have had the tranx a couple seasons but just got my Nast last year it's so far and above from the TI 9' I had before.  The musky hunter will be on at 11pm tonight.
900730,Gregoire,2015-03-01 03:25:00,1397,"If you are going with the Tranx and pairing it with an 8'6"" rod or larger I'd go with a high speed reel and a jerkbait rod for the other rod."
900492,Gregoire,2015-02-27 18:45:00,1397,"Good to hear that you are not fishing clear water. It sounds like all you will have to do is work on your figure 8. The better you get at it, the more fish you will land."
900504,Fisherpete,2015-02-27 19:26:00,1814,Go out with Darcy Cox. You will learn a ton.
900522,manitoubass2,2015-02-27 22:14:00,11391,Gotta contact #?
900523,Fisherpete,2015-02-27 22:20:00,1814,"Here's his Facebook page, Andrew (Lunkerhunter) can send you his contact info. We went out with him the past two summers - you won't be disppointed!"

900535,Roy,2015-02-27 23:57:00,13728,I have an idea. Give Marc Thorpe a call. He'll give you the best advice you need for the biggest fish on the Larry or the Ottawa.

900552,Pigeontroller,2015-02-28 01:32:00,2793,"I can't believe its not been mentioned yet, most important gear to have for Muskie...Proper release tools. #1 a good Muskie specific net, Frabill Big Game, or Big Kahuna(deep boats). Long nose pliers, and most importantly HOOK CUTTERS. Knipex brand mini bolt cutters are worth the extra $$, CT mini 8'' bolt cutters are better than nothing..."

900554,scugpg,2015-02-28 01:40:00,1373,Good point. Stow master or frabill power stow also very good net options if you don't have much room to store in the boat. Recall a store in international falls used to carry them last time I was up there.
900561,Handlebarz,2015-02-28 03:17:00,3790,We were waiting for you
900564,manitoubass2,2015-02-28 03:33:00,11391,Hey hey hey!!!!  Probably wasnt mentioned because its winter still lol.  Ill be getting frabill big game and knipex for sure. I got the pliers already.  Man im excited!!!!  First year goal is to get some 40's(hopefully)  Anything bigger will be a big bonus.
900585,cowanjo,2015-02-28 13:46:00,249,"Year one at Lake of the woods if I could start all over heres what I would have  Big Nasty Revo Toro Winch 60/61 150 PLB mono leader Handlebarz LoTW Special (just ask Mike to make one) - plus Silver Black and chartreuse Black (3 colours) Oriellys glide baits - catches a few but finds all the ones for the baits above (two colours) Gold with orange and black with orange Hosebait  What dax said - knipex, Big kahuna, pliers, Camera and no one mentioned loads of sunscreen/lip stuff.  You will get one greater that 40 for sure  - and listen to Fisherpete he did the guide trip with Andrew there last year and slayed them  have a great time we will be there in July again come have a beer"
900612,manitoubass2,2015-02-28 16:44:00,11391,Where do youse stay cowanjo?
900634,Andy,2015-02-28 19:35:00,330,"Today's Musky Hunter episode was on LOTW with Bill Sandy. It was worth watching, especially if you are going to be fishing there.  Double 10s are obviously a go to lure. Saric says he favours a selection of double 10s, a couple shallow invaders, a black bulldawg, a jerkbait ( he pushes Phantoms) and a shallow raider crankbait."
900640,manitoubass2,2015-02-28 19:50:00,11391,Uggh. I dont get wfn(is that whats its on?)  Saric is an animal  Think i might just order some of his videos today

900672,manitoubass2,2015-02-28 20:58:00,11391,500 down the drain.  Just ordered a tranx?  Time to practice the righty lol
900674,manitoubass2,2015-02-28 21:04:00,11391,"And now a revo toro winch...  Ill calm down now and order rods in a few weeks.  So is is pretty universal to go with a 8' and a 8'6""?"

900342,Handlebarz,2015-02-26 22:37:00,3790,"For the rod on big bucktails if you have the extra cash go for the sling blade or big nasty. Don't get anything shorter then 8'6"" if your looking for a serious full time rod.  As for reels the Abu NACL 60 series is great and will stand up to the big musky up there. If you have crazy cash then the Tranx is awesome I have it on the big nasty and its great for big blades all day."
900343,manitoubass2,2015-02-26 22:41:00,11391,"Yeah tranx is abit much, but well see lol.  Does the revo toro winch or calcutta b come in lefty?"
900344,manitoubass2,2015-02-26 22:45:00,11391,Well im off to go spend some shooniya?
900345,Fisherpete,2015-02-26 22:48:00,1814,"I had a Curado 300 EJ, which is the beefed up version of a Curado. Overall it was NOT a great muskie reel. Very weak drag does not allow for effective hooksets. Higher gearing is not ideal for hard pulling baits. You will burn yourself (and the reel) out fast trying to reel in blades with a Curado.  Read the other current post on muskie rods and reels - there is a ton of discussion about muskie reels there. If I was just to have one reel, as Lew said it would be a round Shimano. Whether it be a B, D or TE series, so long as it is in the 400 size.  What is your budget?  As for tackle, I just finished texting another budding muskie fisherman a list of lures - he said he wanted to start with 8, and what would I suggest. This was my list:  1) Twin ten - natural colour 2) Twin ten - bright colour 3) 9' Grandma or similar crankbait 4) Muskie sized spinnerbait (M&G, Northland Booty Call or similar) 5) Top raider or similar 6) Suick or Sledge or similar 7) Shallow Invader crankbait 8) Hellhound or similar glide bait  There is no true deep diving lure on that list, but for LOTW I don't even use them. I would add a big plastic or two (Bulldawg, Titan tube) to that list, but to throw them you might need a different rod.  Hope this helps  Pete"
900346,lew,2015-02-26 22:49:00,12766,"Does the calcutta b come in lefty?  I don't believe it does, sorry didn't realize you were looking for lefty"
900348,manitoubass2,2015-02-26 22:52:00,11391,"Budget is about $2000  For rods baits and reel. I may wait on some baits and order blades from mike.  Just depends on what I find  And lew i prefer lefty but righties are fine too.  I just prefer to hookset with my right arm, feels more natural"
900349,lew,2015-02-26 22:57:00,12766,I may wait on some baits and order blades from mike.    Before ordering baits I'd check with the locals and see what colors work where your gonna be fishing. Musky baits can be crazy expensive and no sense buying what doesn't work for a particular area. Get an idea then contact Mike and he'll set you up.  PS... orange blades on a BIG black skirt will boat you a biggun anywhere
900350,chris.brock,2015-02-26 23:11:00,4053,"I don't know Rick, are you sure you want to spend that much before you've tried it?  You could use your pike outfit and buy a few new baits, try it out and see if it's your cup of tea.  oh yeah, I have a 20 year old Curado, lots of hours burning big buck tails, it's still fine and did not burn out"
900351,Raf,2015-02-26 23:13:00,3495,"for what it's worth 80% of the time I am casting in the summer I'm either throwing a bootail of some sort or a jerkbait like a suick/wades wabbler.  this is fishing shield water like you'll encounter on LOTW.   i used to be a lure junky but have found that KISS (keep it simple stupid) applies to me and muskie fishing best.   i've found (for me a least) it's better to learn to work a small number of select lures really well and when/where to use them than it is to have a boatload of lures and my catching has increased.  if someone asked me what are the first lures they should buy I would tell them a bootail, a 9-10"" jerkbait, a topraider and a 10"" jake.  never fished LOTW but from what I've read and heard, the top water bite can be pretty hot up there so I'd invest in a topraider.  Any colour is good as long as its black."
900354,Fisherpete,2015-02-26 23:36:00,1814,"I used to have every lure in every colour possible - but have really downsized in the last two seasons. as Raf said, not necessary. A few proven performers, used properly will catch you plenty of fish. I do have a good selection of blades however, but they vary in weight and blade size as well as colour. Casting in heavy weeds and rocks - lighter. Deeper structure - heavier."
900364,rufus,2015-02-27 00:07:00,267,"The Revo Toro Winch comes left or right.   Yeah tranx is abit much, but well see lol.Does the revo toro winch or calcutta b come in lefty?"

900370,Handlebarz,2015-02-27 00:29:00,3790,Gord Pyzer just did a awesome seminar at musky Sunday on lotw it was great and very educational for anyone fishing that area. He talked about the different parts of the lake and how they all break down. The colour choices for each area this was a must see for guys fishing that area.
900374,manitoubass2,2015-02-27 00:46:00,11391,"Yeah I was just there a few months back. He orders in some grubs for me.  and chris I said I had $2000, lol doesnt mean thats what id spend haha.  so figure 8 is indeed shut down?  canadian tire sucked. Id rather wait and get proper gear.  so all in all i walked away with a musky hunter magazine, pretty dissapointing but I got lots of time yet.  i talked abit to mike and told him my go too for big pike always involves black lol.  so im happy to hear a few seasoned musky guys say black"
900375,manitoubass2,2015-02-27 00:49:00,11391,Gord is the man! I read everything i can from him. We chat once in awhile on facecrack about rainy river. Doods awesome!  If i ever get the chance to attend his seminars ill be there as quick as possible!
900376,Raf,2015-02-27 00:51:00,3495,"dick pearson is another name you should pay attention to, NWO & muskies are his thing.  not sure how many seminars he does these days but he has a book & dvd (muskies on the shield) that is a worthwhile read and watch"
900377,manitoubass2,2015-02-27 00:54:00,11391,Thanks raf!
900412,solopaddler,2015-02-27 11:09:00,8605,"Hey Rick I fully agree with previous comments suggesting round reels. As a lefty myself I've tried them all. My strong recommendation would be the Daiwa Luna 300L. Smooth, solid as a Swiss watch and a better reel at least imo than the Calcutta B series."
900416,scugpg,2015-02-27 11:58:00,1373,The Toro NaCl 51 or 61(both leftys) is a very nice reel. Versatile gear ratio and not too big to handle. Also has a bait clicker and could double as a trolling reel once in a while. Looks sharp too.  St Croix legend tournament 8'6 sling blade is a great one to start with if you're just after 1 rod for now.  Could always order from pro tackle in Belleville believe they have free shipping if you can't find a deal locally.
900424,Andy,2015-02-27 13:07:00,330,"Having a basement full of lures, if I had to start again I would get.... 1. An okuma musky rod, heavy action in the 7' 4"", 7' 6"" or 8' length. All just a little over $100.00. I have the 7' 4"" that I use for jerkbaits. It's a little stiff for smaller bucktails, but it will work for pretty much anything, including smaller bulldawgs. I would avoid a 9' rod for a first  rod. 2. Abu Garcia Revo NaCl Toro, the 50 size. Great all purpose reel if you can afford it. Other reels I use and like are the Curado 300 and the Okuma Citrix. The Okuma Komodo also looks good. 3. 9 inch weighted firetiger suick. A great jerkbait. 4. Salmo skinner 20 in real roach color. A great crankbait. 5. A couple single bladed bucktails like  a Mepps Giant Killer,  a Mepps Musky marabou, Mepps Magnum or a Windells Harasser. I still prefer my single bladed bucktails. Maybe a  double 8 or double 9 bucktail or two. Silver and black, orange and black, chartreuse and black are good colors. Yellow has been good to me as well. I personally don't enjoy throwing double tens, so I might be missing out on some fish, but that's the way it is for me. It might be different if I had a reel like the Tranx, but I don't.  I would talk to someone who fishes the area about double tens. They would tell you if they are a must have bait or not. 6. A topraider. 7. A regular black and orange bulldawg or Super D. 8. A large spinnerbait or two. Orange and black and something else. Northland Bionic bucktail spinnerbaits are fairly economical and they work. From there you can figure out what lures you like fishing best and then add to your collection. I personally can throw rise and dive jerkbaits all day, so I have lots of sledges, suicks, wades wobblers, bobbies etc. Yet I can't catch fish on a glider like a hellhound or a phantom. It doesn't make sense, but that's the way it is. It makes no sense to get too many of one lure type until you've spent some time on the water. Spend the rest of your money on 80-100 lb moss green braid, leaders, tools, gloves and a nice net. That's my two cents worth. Andy"
900443,rufus,2015-02-27 14:50:00,267,"Double tens are extremely popular in the area. One of the reasons I bought my Revo Toro Winch is because you can throw double tens all day long and reeling them in not tiring at all. That is what the winch was designed for - reeling in big lures that generate a lot of resistance.   I personally don't enjoy throwing double tens, so I might be missing out on some fish, but that's the way it is for me. It might be different if I had a reel like the Tranx, but I don't.  I would talk to someone who fishes the area about double tens. They would tell you if they are a must have bait or not. "
900452,Gregoire,2015-02-27 15:37:00,1397,"If you have a good budget, like you seem to have, do not cheap out on the rod, especially if you will be casting 10's all day long, and doing an 8 at the end of each cast. For that reason I would recommend the big nasty. This rod is the best bucktail and figure 8 rod in my opinion. The stiff tip especially makes doing 8's easier, especially at the end of the day. I also feel like you get a better and quicker hookset with the big nasty, something that is essential when hooking fish boat side. For a lefty the revo winch is the best bucktail reel IMHO, and can be used for other lures as well. If I could only have one combo it would be a winch on a big nasty.  As far as tackle goes I would get some double tens, a topraider, a side to side topwater, and a shallow invader in the regular and mag size, and a dive and rise bait like a suick.  From what I have heard, the eastern part of LOTW has much clearer water, and lower density of fish. I would also echo that you should hire a guide, but for multiple days, in quicken the learning curve. I think with a guide booking booking mulitple days in a row makes them more familiar with you, and more likely for you to pick up on how they pattern fish, so that you can use the information yourself.  From my experience fishing on LOTW and fishing musky in general, I can say without a doubt that you will be missing fish if you are not throwing a double ten. They are especially key for performing the figure 8, and for going back on fish that you have seen previously. That does not mean that you will not be able to catch fish on other baits, I have hooked fish on LOTW on cranks, jerks and rubber, but if you want your best chance to catch fish in almost any musky lake, you should be casting a double 10."
900453,Lunkerhunter,2015-02-27 15:49:00,455,I have a few revo toro's 61 (lefty) and have been pretty happy with them. I have had to get them serviced at least every 2 years but I use them quite a bit.  I recently bought a Calcutta 401D which is also a lefty reel and have to say I enjoy using it more than the toro's. The toros are low profile so they are a bit more comfortable but the Calcutta is much smoother and overall performs better in my opinion. I recently bought another 401D I liked it so much  I also have a okuma komodo which they make with a high gear ratio. I use this on my jerkbait/topwater rod and really enjoy it. Its also a low profile reel and much cheaper than the above options. I prefer this reel over the daiwa lexa 400 and they are similar priced.  as for rods I would stick with the st Croix legends or the NEW shimano compres if you want to save a few bucks. I say new because the old ones are heavy as hell but I have used the new ones and they weren't bad.  also I once stayed in the clear water on lake of the woods with fisherpete......we drove 30 miles one way to get the hell out of that area each day....needless to say we have never been back to the clear water.
900456,manitoubass2,2015-02-27 16:06:00,11391,"I dont fish clearwater at all. Nice area to camp thats about it.  I have one spot I cant wait to try, ive marked tons of musky while walleye fishing. Its of an island, its breaks into a point. One side is 7-9fow and rock, has a nice eddie, then drops to 20fow with some nice weeds. Does that sound good to the musky guys???  Im going to ponder the rods and reels, i might go with two each and order them online.  Wait for most my baits when the shop in nestor opens, and order some from mike as well.  Ill wait until the shop opens for my net, cutters and terminal tackle.  Feel free to keep up the suggestions. Gives me some studying material for those boring days im not out sledding or fishing lol.  Im for sure going out with a guide at least two days. I hear a good local reasonably close to me is chuck leach. Anyone heard anything? I think hes arou d northwest angle but im not sure  I should also clarify im located on the south east side. Water is not very clear.  Anyone with navionics see if you can find brule point or brule island. That will give you an idea of where i launch, at morson"

Also canadian tire here is stocked well with musky gear.  Ill keep ya updated as i drive around and hit up shops.  I know there is good ones in nestor falls and souix narrows as well(south of kenora on the way to emo or fort frances)
900296,Lunkerhunter,2015-02-26 15:46:00,455,yes I have been to the shops in fort frances and Sioux narrows. they aren't too bad if your in those areas but a bit of a hike from kenora
900299,manitoubass2,2015-02-26 15:53:00,11391,Yep..  And fort frances sucks for musky gear anyhow lol  I just mentioned that because i didnt look at where youd be heading from
900300,Handlebarz,2015-02-26 15:54:00,3790,Lotw is everyone's destination goal I also heard that Ryan closed shop it was from one of his close friends I heard it from plus he would shut it down for the winter months and go home to Winnipeg.  I have never fished it but have many customers that do alot and their bait of choice is inline bucktails. They all seem to do best on them but use jerk bait or glide baits to find musky or top water baits like the top raider.  If you need flashabou I can help out and you will save alot over the prices up there even when you add in the shipping.  Have a great time up north
900302,Old Ironmaker,2015-02-26 16:11:00,8243,"M2B2, I used a Shimano Curado on my fall Musky trip. I'm not a level wind guy and I didn't get 1 backlash, not a one. If it's in your budget go for 1. Take a look at Mike P's website on the above post. He is getting a great reputation across North America. Thank goodeness there aren't any Musky waters nearby me otherwise I'd be living in a tent and have the house full of Musky stuff. Good luck. What's good luck in your language?"
900319,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-26 19:16:00,956,"That musky that I'm holding Rick was caught using a 6"" perch by Live Target.  Grab a lure for every depth.  One that goes just under the surface.  Another 5-10 feet and another that can get down 15 plus feet.  Trolling is the key.  That's just my two cents, but there's guys on here a lot better then I am at musky fishing."
900321,lew,2015-02-26 19:25:00,12766,Trolling is the key.  If your not doing a lot of casting in shallower water around structure your gonna be missing a HUGE amount of big fish.  Trolling is good but there's many many big fish taken while casting.  Mix it up and find what's working.
900322,esoxansteel,2015-02-26 19:28:00,1307,"Mike P's   (HandleBarz)   are certainly popular, and very effective within the muskies range, but from MCI members who fish LOTW, they are even more effective within that body of water, they are tough as nails, and start up is fantastic, and you dont waste half the cast waiting for the blades to start turning, always figure eight on LOTW as on average 7 of 10 fish come on it"
900323,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-26 19:30:00,956,"That's right Lew.  Gotta say nothing beats catching a musky while casting.  I say Rick is since you just moved to LOTW and you don't know the water yet you should consider hiring a guide.  They are pretty expensive, but can save you a lot of time and money(gas) looking for them."
900324,Gregoire,2015-02-26 19:34:00,1397,"Trolling is great in the fall, but you could catch a lot of fish on LOTW by throwing bucktails. I echo the sentiment to contact Mike P. He'll hook you up with a bunch of buctails at a fraction of the retail cost. LOTW is also a huge lake, which differs greatly depending on the area of the lake that you are fishing, and density of musky changing as well. However, no matter the part of LOTW you will find really big musky."
900325,manitoubass2,2015-02-26 19:45:00,11391,"Mike has already extended his hand(of course).  So my main goal now is rod and reel. Im a lefty so im probably gonna lean towards the curado if i can find any. Is it the 301e everyone raves about?  Ill be casting more then trolling. Thats how i like to fish walleye/bass/pike.  I did just move closer to LOTWs but ive fished it a million times, but almost all that is on the east side, been a few times north. But ill mainly stick to the east side and spend the next 5 years learning it for musky instead of walleye lol.  Seems figure 8 baits may be closed. But ill double check around 4. Phone is outta service but who knows?  Slim pickens here, seems most in the area order online or buy at canadian tire, which does have a good selection here."
900327,LostAnotherOne,2015-02-26 19:52:00,956,When fishing on a lake that could produce a big musky I always say be careful what you wish for cause it could come true.  I almost fell out of the boat the first time a big musky followed my lure up to the boat lol.  No joking.  Knees buckled and almost in I went.  You will get a big one on the side of your boat.  Good luck.

900335,manitoubass2,2015-02-26 21:58:00,11391,"K boys, im looking for a reel.  Any suggestions really quick?  Which make of curado?  Anyone try revo rocket?  Id rather go curado but i need to hold a reel first"
900337,rufus,2015-02-26 22:15:00,267,Not the rocket but I have the Revo Toro Winch and it works well for me.
900338,lew,2015-02-26 22:18:00,12766,"I'd move up to one on the Shimano round reels, maybe a Calcutta B 400 series but that's just me. You may just tie into a huge fish on LOTW and I wouldn't want to chance it with a Curado, even though their a decent reel."
900339,bigbuck,2015-02-26 22:26:00,2449,"Shimano reel and a St Croix Premier or Legend rod, 7ft+ in Med Hvy action to toss bucktails. And a 7ft or less in hvy or x/hvy to toss glide baits and jerk baits. Then a nice Shimano Tekota on a 8ft glass trolling rod. All spooled with 80lb minimum braided line. Some floro leaders and a hard wire steel leader for jerks and gliders. A few bucktails, a couple Suicks, Hellhound, Top Raiders, the list goes on and on. LOTW is my all time favourite body of water. Musky, pike, walleye, bass..... + the most beautiful scenery."
