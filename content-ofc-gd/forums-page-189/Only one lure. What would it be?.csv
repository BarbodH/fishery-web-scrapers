897343,manitoubass2,2015-02-11 03:59:00,11391,We should do it again. But different then the dollerama derby.  Any gear you choose but you have to use the lure mentioned in the thread.

I want mine with a 3/0 EWG hook and if it's not cheating I'd like to carry a few split shot.  Surface lures are fun, but if that's all you got, there are going to be some long days. Crank baits and jerk baits are great, but there are summer days when you are going to retrieve move weeds than fish.  There's also the question of depth...unless you're throwing a sinking bait, you are stuck within a depth range.  Inline and bent wire baits and spoons have to be kept moving.  Anything that spins doesn't work that well around weeds, and on some days, the flash will put the fish down.  Jig are deadly, and would be my second choice.  The problem is I wouldn't want to be stuck with only one profile all season and everywhere...You can drag, hop or swim a jig, but if you're stuck with one profile and one weight /style of jig head this isn't going to allow that much versatility..  Enter the Mid-size worm either mid-brown or dark green.  It can be fished on top, in the middle or on the bottom.  The variations are almost endless... Move it fast, slow, or not at all. Hooked weedless or wacky or as a drop shot. Change the profile by splitting it in half length-wise for a finesse drop-shot. Bite off a chunk to reduce it's length and profile.

A paddle tail on a weedless bass jig, with a matching skirt would be an outstanding big fish bait.  Multi-species, weedless, fishes all depths.  Hop it, swim it, or drag it...The only short fall is size, half the time it will be too big or too small,.  You can cut some off or trim the skirt to make it look smaller,.  It needs to be moving to work the tail, but on a lot of days, it might be best.  Over the summer it might very well win weight, but not numbers."

897823,manitoubass2,2015-02-13 04:15:00,11391,Garry2s  Look on the first page at my post.  The reasons I chose that bait is because I can fish it numerous ways for a multitude of species. On ice or soft water.  Only difference between you and I is I chose a shakey head jig?
897843,Garry2Rs,2015-02-13 10:12:00,1425,I'm going to use a split-shot right next to the knot when I want to do shaky head...grin. Speaking of shaky heads...Have you ever tried the Z-man baits?

If you were told you were only allowed to use one artificial fishing bait, in one colour (you can use different sizes) what would it be?

For years, my top brand would be the Rebel one that swims backwords but as of recent I think I would take the Live target one in dark brown. It means I would have to ice fish with only minnows and a hook from now on, but the number of Bass, Walleye and Pike I land off of that crank over the summer make up for it.  How about you guys?
