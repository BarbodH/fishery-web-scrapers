900916,Woodsman,2015-03-02 07:05:00,1286,Damn I lose an hour of time off my ice bungaloo rental!!!
900919,Canuck2fan,2015-03-02 10:09:00,1444,"Yep looks like another year of not being out steelhead fishing during the change... Having it change so early means the ice is still in big time, even with the mini thaw coming this week.  Before George Bush messed with it being the first Sunday in April, I had some great days on the tribs during the change, even though the fish still starting biting at the old time."
900921,dave524,2015-03-02 10:26:00,4508,"i thought we did that in spring, thanks, wouldn't have guessed it was that time again looking outside."
