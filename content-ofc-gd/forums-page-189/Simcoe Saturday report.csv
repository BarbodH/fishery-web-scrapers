900812,irishfield,2015-03-01 21:30:00,26272,"Boys in Temagami had to figure out how to get water hot first and then pour it on their buddy heaters 1lb tank before it would work correctly, for most of the week. Was so cold (-39 to -30) they just couldnt' make vapour, while I had no issues with my 20 lbr.  Edit... give thought to the water in the hole you drilled is at ZERO C !"
900868,icefisherman,2015-03-02 01:52:00,952,"Yes Wayne, the tech support guy said the  bigger 20 lbs tank is less affected of this phenomenon as it is higher pressure. But the small one needs to be able to contact with outside air to warm up as the propane inside boils at -43 degrees Celsius. This is the reason for the frost on the outside of the tank. I got about 4 hrs on low from my 1 lb refilled tank on Sat.  Cheers, Ice Fisherman"
900869,irishfield,2015-03-02 01:55:00,26272,"As noted... if you're having problems, just dip your tank in the hole for a bit.. the water is ZERO degrees."
