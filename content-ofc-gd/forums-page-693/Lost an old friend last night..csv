460162,greenfshrmn,2010-04-26 23:47:00,65,"Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.  All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together...."

460170,Rich Clemens,2010-04-26 23:56:00,3131,"This was sent to me - and I just hung on to it.   TREAT ME KINDLY  Treat me kindly, my beloved friend, For no heart in all the world is more grateful for kindness than the loving heart of me.  Do not break my spirit with a stick, For though I should lick your hand between blows, your patience and understanding will more quickly teach me the things you would have me learn.  Speak to me often, For your voice is the world's sweetest music, as you must know by the fierce wagging of my tail when your footsteps fall upon my ears.  Please take me inside when it is cold and wet, For I am a domesticated animal, no longer accustomed to the bitter elements. I ask no greater glory than the privilege of sitting at your feet beside the hearth.  Keep my pan filled with water, for I cannot tell you when I suffer thirst. Feed me clean food that I may stay well, to romp and play and do your bidding, to walk by your side, and stand ready, willing and able to protect you with my life, should your life be in danger.  And, my friend, when I am very old, and I no longer enjoy good health, hearing and good sight, do not make heroic efforts to keep me going.  I am not having fun. Please see that my trusting life is taken gently. I shall leave this earth knowing with the last breath I drew, that my fate was always safest in your hand.  --- By Beth Norman Harris 1968 ---"

460226,tightline,2010-04-27 01:57:00,322,"I just had to put down my Shepard Tessa in February...I got her as a pup at 6 weeks and had 13 amazing years with her.  She went coast to coast with me 2 trips both in the back of my truck(front when she decided the slider was a doggy door)..She had a stroke one night and couldn't lift her head anymore and as much as it pained me I couldn't live with myself to see her living like that.. I miss her everyday and haven't been able to bring myself to find another yet(maybe soon I need a boat buddy)  Sorry you had to go through that lookinforwalleye, its as hard for most as when a family member dies, May he be surrounded by tennis balls and jerky treats til you see him again.  Here's a pic of my old girl just to tribute the fallen "
460277,Rattletrap2,2010-04-27 03:13:00,1652,"Sorry to read this news Gord. Our condolences for sure.  Our own old guy is 14 this year and is showing some serious signs of decline. He stumbles on the stairs a lot and just tonight, he stumbled coming across the bridge and I thought his hind legs had given out completely. It is difficult to see this happen to him and I can't imagine the loss you are feeling over Baron."
459884,lookinforwalleye,2010-04-26 15:05:00,4399,"Baron the family pet of 15 years died in his sleep last night,now I know how some of you guys felt when you went through this. He has been going downhill the last month or so but we did not have the heart to put him down as he did not seem to be in any pain so we thought we would let nature run it`s course,It`s a tough deal for sure!"

They are such close friends  MEMORIES  ""Not the least hard thing to bear when they go from us, these quiet friends, is that they carry away with them so many years of our lives. Yet, if they find warmth therein, who would begrudge them those years that they have so guarded? And whatever they take, be sure they have deserved.""  --- John Galsworthy ---"
460160,misfish,2010-04-26 23:45:00,29133," Billy, I couldnt/didnt want to either,but had to, as the rest of the family was not able.   Those that think a pet is just a pet,and thats all they are too you,,,,,,,,,,,,   Shame on you.  I will give you this one piece of advise if I may.Dont be rushing out for a replacement, thinking it will ease your pain.Give it time.It,s been 5 years for me.I really want another shorthair or lab,but not the time just yet."
