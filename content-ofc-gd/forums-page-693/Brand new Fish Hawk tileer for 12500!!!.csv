460138,landry,2010-04-26 23:19:00,1005,"Just a heads up. I just bought a boat in the states and I love it but I can't stop looking so I found this SWEET deal. Google ""sitemash crestliner"" and get to jaxed.com.Type in Fish Hawk and voila - a brand new crestliner fish hawk 1600 tiller with 60 hp 4 stroke merc on it being sold by a dealer. This is no scam. It is from a closed dealership being sold by an existing one in Chicago area. NEW - 12500 + Canadian taxes (13%) + 209 RIV trailer fee. Just trying to help out my fellow Canadians!!!!! This boat will be gone by tomorrow for sure! I have owned 2 side console versions of this boat and it is a sweet ride. Landry"
