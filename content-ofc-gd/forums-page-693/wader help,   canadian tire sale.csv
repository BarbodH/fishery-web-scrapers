460456,bow slayer,2010-04-27 17:51:00,1074,"I picked up a pair of the half price ones at CT. They seemed to be alright   for 100 bucks ,the brand name is WOODS.They are boot foot with a felt bottom. This will be my first pair of boot foot waders. My last ones were Fenwick breathable stocking foot which have lasted 10 years and before that I had 5mmm Bare neopreme. I hated those,starting leaking after 2 seasons and pain in the ass to put on/off.Boot foot just seemed to be easier to put on/take off."
