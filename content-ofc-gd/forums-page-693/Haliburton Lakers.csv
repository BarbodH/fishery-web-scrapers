459719,chris.brock,2010-04-26 01:11:00,4053,"2 lakers and 3 ciscoes, all 70 to 90 feet down, vertical jigging a spoon, they didn't seem very active and lots were suspended at all different depths  I could see the MNR CO talking to some guys taking their boat out, they were there talking a long time (around an hour) so I guess there was trouble, when the CO left I over heard the guys saying ""he must have had binoculars"" and something about ""a border-line slot fish"", busted!"
459782,singingdog,2010-04-26 10:18:00,1047,What lake were you fishing? I'm finding the same thing....fish suspended all over the place from 7' right to the bottom.
459801,solopaddler,2010-04-26 11:58:00,8605,"Gotta love ice out lakers.  In my experience no matter how many fish you mark down deep this time of year, you'll generally catch more flatlining. Active fish are near the top feeding."
460114,singingdog,2010-04-26 22:49:00,1047," That's what I usually figure, but I am having very little luck. 58 degree water, showing lots of fish at 7-10' deep, throwing all the usual presentations at them but no takers. Any tips?"

460159,Jigger,2010-04-26 23:44:00,1237,"Lipless crankbaits are also your friend. Casting for lakers is my favourite thing to do. Although 58deg is pushing a little deeper. If you think there in 7-10fow, cast away. Rippin hair jigs is also a good thing."
460384,johnnyb,2010-04-27 14:47:00,3413,"Check out TDunn's report...further north (ie. colder water...no?) and started to have success down deep.  I'm not reading a ton of successful shallow laker reports yet this year...don't know what's happening, but it does kinda sound like they're down a bit deeper than usual"
460396,jimmer,2010-04-27 15:29:00,2730,"Hey Johnnyb Maybe the water warmed up faster this spring.  I did have some luck in shallow, but they were definitely finicky.  Tipping with a live minnow helped."
460422,johnnyb,2010-04-27 16:20:00,3413,"makes sense that the water would warm up quicker...that's for sure.  Also makes sense that you caught a few...'cuz you always do!!!  White twister tail and a minnow, eh...?"
460454,Aaron Shirley,2010-04-27 17:44:00,655,"Hey Chris, glad to hear you got some. Knowing the lakes you fish, that's a decent day no? Surprised you had to fish that deep at this time of year!"
