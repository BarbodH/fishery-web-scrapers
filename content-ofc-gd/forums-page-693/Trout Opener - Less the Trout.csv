Yes, it was a possibility to get into a few but this destination can be difficult for drop backs but did provide other critters.  The Set Up     Vast Exploration     Cats On The Pin       As expected, we didn't hook into any Steel. The count in the end though was a mixed bag.  5 Channel Cats 3 OOS Walleye 2 OOS Smallies 1 Rock Bass 1 Mooneye   The rain held off just enough to still be able to chill around the fire with a few drinks, good food and some sweet tunes!

460050,Roy,2010-04-26 20:25:00,13728,Sounds like a pretty comfy time to me....minus the JD though. I'll bring a box of Ol' Milwackie.
