459213,Leecher,2010-04-24 02:47:00,7832,"My god ....  manage to get out fishing on softwater after a long awaited time lapse from the icy counter-top LOL  I was real glad to get out there and was a real tough day trying for them square tails.  The cold front that kicked in last night, really put a damper on the bite.... was 1 for 3, and at least did not come back empty  Put a little video together.... Don't laugh about the ""SO EM"" statement....it does come up often LOL  enjoy!!!

459231,Leecher,2010-04-24 03:40:00,7832, Thanks waterwolf!!!  Not a cloud in the sky but the wind was brutal.... kept changing direction on us     Going back soon for some more but will wait on the new moon phase   Thanks Tibbs!!!  Good luck to you tomorrow     Hope you have better luck than I had today.... was real tough bite to say the least
459236,Mike the Pike,2010-04-24 04:19:00,3421,At least you didn't get skunked Jacques are you trying to get your own show on WFN.
459267,Leecher,2010-04-24 12:45:00,7832, Thanks Mike!!!  Yeah just got that one after switching lures..... Caught it on the walleye rig (white slip bobber type).  There was a lot of locals fishing yesterday and not too many hooked some.  About the show.... no not too good in front of the CAM.... uummm too much LOL just having fun
459268,limeyangler,2010-04-24 12:52:00,5204,"Great Video Jacques, tough bite eh? yeah...it happens...but you got one , that helps. gotta love those mepps black fury...so effective for so many species...i even caught walleye on those last year when everything else was not working.   I should send you my raw video footage so you can do the production work...great job on the vid!"
459269,Leecher,2010-04-24 13:03:00,7832," Thanks Simon!!!  Yeah them square tails were tight lipped yesterday but was real nice to be out and finally hook into one     I tried the mepps for a little while and on my 4th or 5th cast, had a huge one follow it to shore and turned at the last second just missing the tip of the treble  I pretty sure it was a rainbow.... would of been nice to land that one.  Oh well thems are the breaks I guess.... but there's always next time  Windows Movie Maker is a great little program to create vids.... I'm getting the hand of it I guess"
459276,Whitespinnerbait,2010-04-24 13:33:00,2038,At least you got out fishing Jacques......catching a fish is always a Bonus........I'm stuck at home looking at birds flying around.....

459484,solopaddler,2010-04-25 11:02:00,8605,"Wish I could see the video, it's not working for me.  You'll get 'em next time I'm sure Jacques."
459494,Leecher,2010-04-25 12:38:00,7832," Thanks Mike!!!  Have you tried clicking on the play button at the bottom left?? What a difference from last year temp wise..... I think the moon phase had an effect on them.  Last year was 7 for 8 and it was the day before the new moon.... This year, new moon was on 14th and got 1 for 3.... 11 1/2"" incher  Ah well there's always next time. Thanks again Mike!!! Jacques"
