We were able to hook into 2 with got off, with out any problems, I had bought some Pink hooks thunken they would work just as well as Red hooks, should have check closer, they were barbless, no wonder why I kept losing phish all winter. So we changed side of the lake to some hidden bays, and harbours, and out of a small weed mat pulled a very nice looken 2lb. largie. Day ended with 2 lost Crappies, 1 Perch, 2 Sunfish, and 1 largie, and a great day of phishen with MikeH who answered my post looken for a partner. Thanks again Mike for a great time out"
