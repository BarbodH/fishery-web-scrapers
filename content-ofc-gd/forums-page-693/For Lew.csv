His home town is in the background I send this to you for the same reason he sent it to me. Looks like a good day on the water to me!

Wildest trip I ever made was running thru 75' waves while crossing the North Sea on our way in to Norway. That's the kinda stuff that stays with you for a lifetime.  Here's a great website you may enjoy too Pete with forums for most of the Navies of the world including some good stuff about Canadian ships.  http://www.worldnavalships.com/forums/index.php"
