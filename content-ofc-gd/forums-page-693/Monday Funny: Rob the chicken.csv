He awoke before the Pearly Gates, where St. Peter said, 'You died in your sleep, Rob....'  Rob was stunned. 'I'm dead? No, I can't be! I've got too much to live for. Send me back!'  St. Peter said, 'I'm sorry, but there's only one way you can go back, and that is as a chicken.'  Rob was devastated, but begged St. Peter to send him to a farm near his home..... The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking, and pecking the ground.  A rooster strolled past. 'So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?'  'Not bad,' replied Rob the hen, 'but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I'm gonna explode!'  'You're ovulating,' explained the rooster. 'Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before? '  'Never,' said Rob.  'Well, just relax and let it happen,' says the rooster. 'It's no big deal.'  Rob did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg!  Rob was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. He soon laid another egg -- his joy was overwhelming.  As he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard his wife yell.....  ""ROB, wake up. You crap the bed!'"
