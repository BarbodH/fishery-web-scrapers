459746,Dutchy,2010-04-26 01:54:00,416,"Me, splashhopper (Sleeping til 5am) and JJcanoe hit a Huron creek at midnight hoping to slam some big bows. Knew there would be alot of dropbacks, but were also hoping to hit into some big brookies (which didn't happen). I had walked the creek a week beforehand and seen some spots that were packed with fish.  Things started slowly, lost one decent sized fish, then started hitting these little roebag thiefs:    JJcanoe managed to nab a couple of 7 inch shakers further upstream. He was fishing the creek in a forest and after he came back we heard the coyotes howling. They seemed fairly close.  Then we moved to a known hotspot which had been crowded at midnight. 2nd drift and I started slamming them, this 26 inch female the biggest:    Ended up getting 6 bows ranging from 2lb to her above. All of the bows went back (including her above) except one spawned out smaller female that I kept. To try and help them get back to the lake, we put them downstream of a big logjam, but not surprisingly most just sat in the creek like this 4lb male I caught:    Lots of fun had by all Dutchy"

460028,JohnF,2010-04-26 19:36:00,3494, He's fine. He wears scuba gear to wade. It just looks kinda funny seeing the 13 footer with a hand attached sticking outa the creek.  JF
