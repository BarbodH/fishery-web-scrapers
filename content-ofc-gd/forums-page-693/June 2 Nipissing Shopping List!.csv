We are not completely inexperienced but have never been to Nipissing before or actively pursued Walleye in any water we have fished. May question for those of you who have fished this time of year at Nipissing is: What should we bring for lures/bait? As well, how would you use these choices? If one does not work what would you move to next? We will be staying at Cozy Cove Cottages which I beleive is at the west edge of Callander Bay.  Any and all help on how to make our trip successful is appreciated!  Thanks,  Chris"

I prefer using a Chartreuse/Orange or White/Chartreuse or Chartreuse/Black 3/8 Jig tipped with a 2""-2.5"" Red/Yellow Dace..... Same combo with a trailer hook using a worm should work just as well.  Wally Diver or Wally Minnow work very well while trolled over humps.  Don't forget the pike gear .. ya might wanna go cast some weedbeds.  Have Fun!!  RFS "

459852,LucG,2010-04-26 13:25:00,779, Bring some water as well. The lake is still quite low.

459925,kickingfrog,2010-04-26 16:20:00,8333,"All the above will work. One of my first options is drifting or trolling crawler harnesses behind 3 ways or bottom bouncers. I've been using scented plastic worms for a number of years up there and I don't if I'll ever bother with live worms again. If you find the fish but aren't getting bit, use a slip sinker with a minnow, leach or worm."
