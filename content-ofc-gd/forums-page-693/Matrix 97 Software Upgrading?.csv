I know they're older and not supported by Humminbird anymore (technology moves too fast), but they do have the latest upgrade available on their site with instructions on downloading. I tried to download using a SD card but have had no luck. I believe the model may be too old for this method. So, before I buy the recommended AS PC2 cable package from Humminbird, I was wondering if anyone has ever done the upgrade, how did it work out and did you see any significant changes?  Larry"
