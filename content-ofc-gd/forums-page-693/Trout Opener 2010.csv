459328,tibbs,2010-04-24 19:36:00,650,I woke up at 4:00am this morning to go steelhead fishing. I think i went 5 for 7 today. I didn't take pictures of all the fish I caught.  Here are the pics:    This was my first fish of the day. It took me for quite an adventure downstream.       Some underwater pictures.          All fish were released unharmed.  I'll probably head out again tomorrow.  Hope everyone else had a great day fishing!
459329,solopaddler,2010-04-24 19:46:00,8605,Way to go kid!  Couple of those underwater shots are great.
459332,douG,2010-04-24 19:56:00,2693,Loving the u/w shots.  I'd take some snaps like that but I'm afraid that I would get my camera wet.  Nice shootin'.
459343,tibbs,2010-04-24 21:14:00,650,Thanks for the replies Solo and Doug!  I'll hopefully take some more underwater pics tomorrow.
459344,limeyangler,2010-04-24 21:17:00,5204,Great stuff Tibbs...i also love the underwater shots. Is it mandatory to catch and release...or just your choice....just wondering is all
459357,tibbs,2010-04-24 21:48:00,650," No, it's not mandatory catch and release. Sometimes I wish it was!"
459361,limeyangler,2010-04-24 21:54:00,5204,I do a lot of catch and release too....in fact i say i release way more than i keep...i will go for walleye and not keep a single one sometimes...much to the bewilderment of some people.
459362,Whitespinnerbait,2010-04-24 21:56:00,2038,Cool report if I don't say so myself..
459365,ehg,2010-04-24 22:06:00,2666,The underwater pictures are the best! What a cool way to spice up a report. Thanks very much
459368,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-24 22:18:00,3761,"Nice job, saw a guy catch some smaller trout while I was sucker fishing this morning.  Thanks for the report, MTBF"

459402,wildeye rainbow,2010-04-25 00:21:00,123,"Nice bows!  I was out doing my traditional opener on a local brown trib.  Water was real low & super clear.  I did get one 8 lb. golden fish though,..., unfortunately, it was a carp.  Great fight on my light tackle.  Although I did get graced with the skunk, it was still nice just being out walking the stream.  WR"
459627,tibbs,2010-04-25 21:49:00,650,"Thanks for the comments!  I went out again today, but wasn't as successful. I went 1 to 2 for steelhead. I also took some underwater pictures, but they didn't turn out the best. I'll post them anyways.        I did catch a nice surprise though.        Even though I didn't catch to many fish, I still had a great day on the river."
