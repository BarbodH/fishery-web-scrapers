459986,commie,2010-04-26 18:12:00,29,I am looking for a fishing guide for within 2 hour drive of the GTA. Needs to hold 2-3 person. Any good recommendations?  Looking for ones that will provide some insightful techinques into Walleye or Bass fishing.  thanks.
460024,saspirilli,2010-04-26 19:28:00,27,We used Greg Klatt for walleye in the Kawarthas and he was great - a very successful morning on the lake:  http://www.profishntanglingservices.com/
460027,Bob Devine,2010-04-26 19:35:00,251,Greg knows the Kawarthas very well. 3 hrs you can be in Windsor and fish the best walleye waters with no slot size and a 6 fish limit. Walleye season is open and the catch and release season of Michigan bass opened on the wknd.
460100,dheitzner,2010-04-26 22:26:00,314,Paul Castelano is one of the best bass fishermen that I have ever had the pleasure of fishing with. http://www.castadventures.ca/ Darcy
460109,irishfield,2010-04-26 22:47:00,26272,"Bay of Quinte for big Walleye.. Lloyd Daume - U & Me Charters. Check the business section, he even had a special offer for OFC'rs going on.."
460140,uglyfish,2010-04-26 23:20:00,981,"i HIGHLY recommend bob devine! spent the weekend in windsor fishing walleyes with him, hes a great guy to spend a day on the water with and will put u on fish!"
460169,scugpg,2010-04-26 23:56:00,1373, Yup give Bob a call. Pretty tough to find bigger walleye/muskie/bass than the Detroit River/Lake St. Clair waters.

460344,RudeBuoy,2010-04-27 12:52:00,28,"All of the above have great reputations, and you can't go wrong. I'll add one more though - look into Taro Murata from Fish City Tours."
460345,dobee,2010-04-27 12:54:00,301,  i second paul castellano. hell of a guide!
460399,dheitzner,2010-04-27 15:37:00,314," He really is.  I consider myself a pretty good angler, but he really blew me away. Can't wait, heading out with him on Sunday for some May steelhead action! Darcy"
460448,JPD,2010-04-27 17:26:00,296,All great suggestions... Simon Frost is another phenomenal guide for Lake Erie smallmouth... and guides on other waters as well but would highly recommend a day with Simon on Erie. Simon Frost Charters  JP
