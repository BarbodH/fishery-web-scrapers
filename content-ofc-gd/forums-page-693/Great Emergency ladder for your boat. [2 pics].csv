If anyone has tried to climb in their boat wherein a wet survival suit in freezing water with out a ladder they can attest to the fact that is almost impossible.  I find it hard even in the summer wherein my trunks to easily hop in.  I stumbled on a photo on some Texas fishing board showing this eladder, did some research and found out the company. I had to order directly from them in Texas but it is exactly what I have been looking for.  It has a pin on the side which you pull out to slide the ladder down.  Thought I would share encase others are looking for this solution.      "

459671,irishfield,2010-04-26 00:13:00,26272,If memory serves me right.. which it rarely does... Lew put one of those (or similar) on his Skeeter.  Not sure what you paid direct.. but hopefully cheaper than boaterplus at $240  http://www.boatersplus.com/r-and-r-design-inc-emergency-exit-ladder-with-bracket.html

I have looked into it and I have decided to fab one up at work I will post pictures. On a side note for anyone wanting to find out what it would be like to go over the side take a buddy out  put on your float suit tie a rope on to yourself and jump in .There use to be a saying and I think it was a commercial for some kids program KNOWING IS HALF THE BATTLE.

We were filming a show one time and I set the hook off balance and fell right off the deck off the bass boat into a huge slop mat in 5 ft of water.  Took 2 guys to get me back in, if I was alone, not sure I could of."

And with the exchange rate, shipping & a small customs charge it was at my door for $244.67  Pricey for 8 pounds of metal but I was tired of looking and would be kicking my self if this year I flopped over and was hanging off my transom freezing my nads off.
