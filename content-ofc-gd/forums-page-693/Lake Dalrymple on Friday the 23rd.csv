459386,Toddyc20,2010-04-24 23:36:00,141,Well I went fishing on Friday morning to see if I could pull in a pike or two.  I went out with two friends and we fished for about 4 1/2 hrs.  We got on the water at around 6:30am and starting working shallow weeds.  Our first fish hit at around 8:40 and it was a small OOS bass.  That bass was quickly unhooked and deposited back into the lake.  About 1 hour later we managed to land one of our target species but it was a bit on the small side.  I would guess around 18 inches.  So all in all a slow day of fishing but one thing I can say is that I must have seen 8-10 decent looking fish.  The would either follow or be swimming around near the boat and I could see them with my polarized glasses.  Maybe when the water is a bit warmer those bigger fish will become more active.  Water temp was 53 F.

459478,bigugli,2010-04-25 10:04:00,6138,Just have to slow down and downsize the presentation if the bite is off. Maybe offer them something they have not seen a thousand times before. The lake sees a lot of angling pressure each year.
459850,johnnyb,2010-04-26 13:19:00,3413,If you can see those big'uns...try twitching a bait (hard or soft minnow bait) in front of them....just let it lay on bottom and see what happens
459854,Toddyc20,2010-04-26 13:29:00,141,This is some great advice.  Thanks to everyone for the help.  I'm always looking to learn more fishing skills.
