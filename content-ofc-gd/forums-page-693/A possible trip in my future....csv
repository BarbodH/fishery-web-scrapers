This will be her first step to her eventual goal of a placement with the MNR, or a similar organization.  Anyway, she's off to Sleeping Giant, just east of Thunder Bay, for an 8 week stint. This looks like a grand opportunity for Dad to be the hero and drive her up to her Summer job... Oh, yeah, I hear that there's fishing up that way too...  Hints are always welcome as to a good place to wet a line, if you know the area..."
460038,TC1OZ,2010-04-26 19:59:00,987," If the fishing is good, you'll be bringing ""care packages"" every weekend!  Sorry I have no tips for you! Good luck to your daughter."
460043,The JAY,2010-04-26 20:12:00,239,"For an 18 hour drive from Hamilton, I doubt it'll be every weekend, but that would be nice... LOL  Thanks!"
460044,Mykester,2010-04-26 20:15:00,241,"Daughter, eh?"
