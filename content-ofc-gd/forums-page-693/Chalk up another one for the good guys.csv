459539,Kinger,2010-04-25 16:08:00,351,I love it.  Its our duty to protect our fisheries!!
459542,bigfish1965,2010-04-25 16:18:00,3382,"I think it happens less actually...the ethical angler numbers are quite high. It is just that we have nearly live info on what is going on, so it seems higher than it is. That being said, the only acceptable level of poaching is ZERO."
459565,Big Cliff,2010-04-25 17:35:00,6899," My wife can! Just after we got married I got into bed one night and noticed a big pair of scissors tied to the headboard of our bed. When I asked what that was all about, she quietly replied ""That's just in case I ever find out you have been cheating on me""! I couldn't sleep for three nights and I hadn't even done anything wrong. Those Scisors are still attached to our headboard and yes, I still have all my parts LOL."
459618,RudeBuoy,2010-04-25 20:57:00,28,Too bad it doesn't always work out so easily. Good on the neighbours for placing the call.
459643,Radnine,2010-04-25 22:44:00,1538," Speaking of not always working so easily,I have to ask this Cliff: How did your neighbour know how many fish they had on board from shore? And what would the OPP had done if they had been within limit and no OOS? Jim"
459644,Michael_Brown,2010-04-25 22:46:00,411,Great news on the enforcement of the new regulations.  Sad thing is that for the 80-90 years here in the kawartha's this behaviour was legal for panfish. This is why the work of the MNR and fishery council was so important. Glad to see an end to the abusive overharvest. It will take a few years for everyone to get the message but thankfully these changes are here to stay.
459729,Big Cliff,2010-04-26 01:20:00,6899," They didn't know how many fish these guys had but they knew it was well over 60. These guys were anchored 20' off the dock in clear sight of several homes none of which was more than 100' away.  I have a spotting scope that I use here quite often, I can see a fishing rod quite clearly from a mile away it would be no problem to watch someone fishing and see if they were releasing or keeping them."
459894,jimmer,2010-04-26 15:38:00,2730,Those numbers are scary! Great job with keeping an eye out Cliff and your neighbours did well to call in what they saw.  That's the way to do it.
459899,jimmer,2010-04-26 15:40:00,2730,I would like to add that I hope the fines are substantial enough to deter others from coming to the Kawarthas for a freezer full of fish.  There is absolutely no need for some one to keep that many fish.  I cleaned 20 bluegills the other day and probably ended up with a couple of pounds of boneless fillets.  That's two meals for the family.
459917,Jackie,2010-04-26 16:08:00,124,"Keeping 450 fish is just retarded......they were probably going to sell it to the supermarket or something...freaking ignorants. Glad that they were caught, GOOD JOB GUYS! KEEP IT UP. this is the only way we can stop those idiots from destroying our fisheries.  "
459305,Big Cliff,2010-04-24 16:22:00,6899,"Was talking with a local fellow this morning, they observed two anglers fishing in front of their place catching and keeping well in excess of their limit. They phoned the OPP who responded promptly and nailed these two anglers with in excess of 450 fish, some OOS.   to the locals    to the OPP for responding promptly and doing something about it. Come fishing on Sturgeon Lake, and a good time will be had by all. Come poaching and your ass is grass, we've had enough!"
459307,e-z-out,2010-04-24 16:33:00,1052,Good to hear Cliff i hope this stops maybe just one other angler from doing the same.
459309,alphaalpha,2010-04-24 16:34:00,475,I love it!
459311,Dutch,2010-04-24 16:40:00,831,"Yes, this is good news.  It sounds as though the positive new fishing regulations in FMZ17 have brought the limit issues to the forefront.  It also appears that calling local police or OPP is the way to go vs. the TIPS line....."
459317,johnnyb,2010-04-24 17:28:00,3413,fantastic!!!
459319,Stern Rules,2010-04-24 17:42:00,342,450 fish is ridiculous. Glad they got busted.
459320,perodimi,2010-04-24 17:56:00,124,"450 is just out of control!  I wonder how much poaching they've been doing before they got caught. Who knows what else they're into as well. People like this have no regard or repect for anything including you and I. As I grow older, I find myself becoming less tolerant and more vocal toward idiots like this, enough is enough.  Thanks for posting this Cliff.  Peter"
459321,shane,2010-04-24 18:21:00,652,Good for the good guys.
459322,fish_fishburn,2010-04-24 18:28:00,1311,I hope they get a search warrant and go and check there freezers as well. Can just imagine what is in there.
459323,Whitespinnerbait,2010-04-24 19:15:00,2038,  Probably another couple of thousand...
459325,Sinker,2010-04-24 19:16:00,8692,SWEET!!!
459326,Rich Clemens,2010-04-24 19:23:00,3131,Good to see they got out there right away and catch them in the act.  Hope their pocketbooks get hit hard for something like this and that they never hold a rod again.
459346,brifishrgy,2010-04-24 21:20:00,559,"  I believe game wardens don't need search warrants, could be wrong though, its been known to happen every once in a while"
459352,bill smy,2010-04-24 21:31:00,31,saw some people today get busted on a trib for keeping 6 trout more than there limit and also with out a licensce.  Nice to see the CO's doing something
459354,Garry2Rs,2010-04-24 21:36:00,1425,Great news! Congrats to Cliff and the neighborhood watch...grin.
459410,Ron,2010-04-25 00:59:00,1683,"Great to hear Cliff.  Hopefully the word gets out and these guys stop the over harvest and maybe, just maybe, the Crappies and Sunfish get bigger so we all can enjoy the fishing opportunities!  Cheers, Ron..."
459415,Daplumma,2010-04-25 01:06:00,1961,"Thats a bit harsh there Rich,however will they pee? Joe"
459417,GoneFishin,2010-04-25 01:15:00,349,"That's good, I'm glad they are responding to people's complaints.  Is it just me or does there seem to be a lot more CO's out there this year? I've been stopped 4 times so far, on shore in areas I never thought they would patrol, and it's been a different co every time. I've got no reason to complain at all, but I'm just not use to being asked for my license by them or even seeing them around :S"
459426,skeeter,2010-04-25 01:47:00,1907,"MNR OFFICERS do not need a search warrant to search. they can enter your place at any time with probable cause.  Big Cliff, I am very happy to hear they got caught, now lets hope they get nailed to the wall by the justice system."
459493,wormdunker,2010-04-25 12:25:00,1711,"Good to hear they got busted.  I fish for a small meal, release alot especially while having a good day catching.  I want my grandchildren to be able to catch a fish in their future.  Thanx Cliff."
459496,Roy,2010-04-25 12:40:00,13728,"You and your neighbourhood are doing good for the fishery, Cliff. Good on ya."
459498,TroutnMuskieHunter,2010-04-25 12:45:00,1362,That's great news Cliff!!....kudos to the people that called the OPP!!
459499,Radnine,2010-04-25 12:48:00,1538,"It's tough to get away with anything in this technologically advanced world, just ask Tiger Woods. I am glad to hear that the OPP responded in a timely fashion (as opposed to the old ""called and no one showed up 'til two days later""). Wouldn't it be great if poachers have met their match in the cell phone and an educated public. Now, can Big Cliff halt infidelity.... Jim"
459517,Rattletrap2,2010-04-25 14:26:00,1652,"Sad to hear that this sort of thing is happening out there, and glad to hear that you folks are doing something about it!  Just a few other comments or thoughts: -Is it just me, or is this activity of keeping outrageous numbers of fish on the rise? -Imagine how much of this is going on that Cliff and his neighbours don't see? - What about all the other lakes? Who is watching them? - What kind of people walk amongst us that feel they can rape the lakes and rivers in this way without any regard whatsoever for the future generations? - Is this activity in way connected to the new open seasons and extended seasons?  My blood just boils at these thoughts!"
459521,Twocoda,2010-04-25 14:54:00,4130, you cant carry the weight of the world on your shoulders....youll get crushed  Good on ya Cliff...maybe create an aura of no tolerance and eyes are always watching
