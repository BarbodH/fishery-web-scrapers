As a bunch of you are aware I was on the search for a CHEAP tinny to put on top of my tent trailer for camping trips. I ended up finding one for $200    The paint was horrible, flaking off bright red. I was going to just live with it but I couldn't. So I took her into the shop Friday afternoon and started stripping her down. This is the best part, the paint flew off with a blow gun    I got everything prepped and started goin at it. The color is the same as the tent trailer so when she goes on top it matches perfectly (almost   )  Had my son helping me (FYI - Clean blackberry lens before taking pics)    Spent about 4 hours on it Friday, 2 Saturday and 1 tonight      I wanted to turn the boat over and all I thought about was Albert's thread   . Luckily this thing is light and I had a forklift   So I hooked her at the bow, lifted it up and spun the back by hand.        I got her all finished up and loaded into my truck. She is light enough to toss around by myself which is great    Hope you enjoyed"
