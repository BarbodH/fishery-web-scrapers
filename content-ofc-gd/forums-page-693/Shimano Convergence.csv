Ill inspect the condition when I come to pick it up... but a friend of mine bought a whack load of rods off this particular guide and they were mint !  Just wondering if that is a good deal Ã‰ Thanks !
459843,Syn,2010-04-26 13:04:00,519,pretty good deal. Worth $70+tax new @ Lebarons.
460080,jedimaster,2010-04-26 21:44:00,3472,Yep they are good rods and thats a good deal. If you break it you can upgrade to a better one and pay the difference. I broke a convergance and got a new compre for 40 bucks or something like that.
