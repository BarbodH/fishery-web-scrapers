Non-stop action from the time we got there. It was funny seeing him catch those jumbos on a bare jigheads after we ran out of our minnows!!!  Thanks for the picture of us on our boat. That’s one of the best picture of the boat if seen. I'm stuck in the city this week-end so I won’t be out there again. Oh well, I guess I'll have to make time in the next few week-ends to get back out on the water.  Tony"
