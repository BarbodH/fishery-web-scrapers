459724,HTHM,2010-04-26 01:15:00,4082,"I need a large tank compressor for a day, in order to refinish my hull. My twin tank Makita does not have the volume of air I need to run a spray gun. Is there anyone in the Hamilton area that would have one availible for a day? I have 220 availible @ 30 amps. And yes I will pick it up and return it, (well depending on how good it is.....  )"
