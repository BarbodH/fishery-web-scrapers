460229,soggey,2010-04-27 02:05:00,20,"I was there Sat for opener. Water is extremely low and clear. Very little fishable water. The level dropped 2 inches on sat so I cant imagine what it looks like now. Didnt see any fish caught, lots of parr around and chub but thats it. Fished the upper river too with the same result. I think the fish did there thing and got the heck out fast. IMO save the gas not worth the trip."
