460074,MCTFisher9120,2010-04-26 21:03:00,3761,"Ok, so here is the deal. For my forage fish collection this summer I need to collect 12 fish and photograph 3 of them. Along with a technical report and detailed charts and fish specimen forms I need a so called UTM map for each site where the fish was collected. I've tried google a bit but I can't seem to find a free UTM map. The area I am collecting in is part of the Leeds and Thousand Islands township with 2-3 lakes and rivers in the area.Where can I find one of these maps that I can print off to use. The local library might have a map but would like to prepare myself in advance just in case.And help would be greatly appreciated by this fello Fleming student Thanks,Mike"

460359,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-04-27 13:33:00,0,Danny beat me to it.  I did that assignment at Sault College.  Since then I've actually continued to collect my own personal collection.  I thought about it last night at work while watching a bunch of spawning rainbow darters.
