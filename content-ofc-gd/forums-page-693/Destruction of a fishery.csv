456016,Big Cliff,2010-04-14 21:17:00,6899,"Good work Bruce, without you, none of this would have happened! It isn't a solution but at least it is a start. Just let us know what we have to do to keep the pressure on until a solution is reached. 100's if not thousands are watching!"
456414,bigugli,2010-04-15 18:29:00,6138,"At this point in time, much seems to be happening. It would appear that a group of government agencies have gotten involved, but are keeping silent while they investigate. Certainly different from the response of 'our hands are tied'. I have shied away from the newsmedia to give some people time to get organized. Seems we've attracted enough attention to our problem that the media are now looking for us. I really do expect a fairly positive outcome."
456423,Spiel,2010-04-15 18:47:00,9065,"The silt cloths in place are only a result of pressure and exposure I'm sure, a band aid solution at best (and seriously, how effective?), far too late in my opinion.  But as mentioned it's a start. Thanks for the updates Bruce."
456429,Michael_Brown,2010-04-15 19:06:00,411,"Great work on this issue.  Don't always assume silence means thay are working on it. As the person filing the complaint, you are allowed follow-up information concerning the status or outcome of the investigation. A freedom of information request will ensure they are following up as required. Might seem excessive but I can assure you it will bring this file to immediate attention in it's repective offices.  The media is still a good option as accountablity to the public is always better when the majority of the public are aware of the issue. This will also send a message to others in the area that may have thought this shoreline clearing was a good idea.  The more squeak the better."
456511,JohnF,2010-04-15 22:16:00,3494, I was thinking that if you ignore the media they might end up going to the politicians and bureaucrats for comment which will bring more pressure to bear.  JF
456513,JohnF,2010-04-15 22:19:00,3494,"Besides, the politicans get training in dealing with the media. Us common folk are grist for their invention mill. I am a firm believer in the ""no comment"" policy. I've had my comments butchered in the press often enough to now know better.  JF"
459971,bigugli,2010-04-26 17:39:00,6138,"Just a short update. The DFO has deemed, from information provided by the NPCA, that there has been no actual disturbance or damage to the stream bed   so they will take this no further action. The MNR and NPCA are still working with the landowner to rectify the situation."
459984,Fisherman,2010-04-26 18:08:00,7201,"Hard to believe that ""they"" believe that no damage or disturbance has been done.  I'm sure if it was the average Joe Schmuck that perpetrated this, he'd be replanting every weed and blade of grass that was disturbed."
460053,Big Cliff,2010-04-26 20:29:00,6899,"Bruce, do you happen to have the name of the DFO employee that deemed there was no damage to the creek bed? I think a letter to their boss demanding that they be retrained would be in order. What do they think all that silt will have done?"
460089,JohnF,2010-04-26 22:00:00,3494,"Jeez. Our local conservation authority won't let the local country club trim the grass down to water's edge to prtect the sanctity (or something) of the watercourse. So now our previously nicely trimmed creek shores are big ole shaggy messes that eat up golf balls galore.  If one authority figgers mere trimming of weeds is a nono, how can another not see the potential for damage in totally screwing with the shoreline in your example?  Methinks the owner might just know someone (or be someone) after all.  Good try but I think you're seeing a little influence at play here. Might be something for the press to have some fun with after all if the other layers of bureaucracy all roll over as well.  JF"
449437,Michael_Brown,2010-03-29 15:36:00,411, I don't think she considers me a friend.     Public awareness of an issue is a good thing. Trying to take on a complex issue by yourself is difficult and frustrating. Other concerned anglers and citizens may wish to become involved if they are aware of the issue.  Good Job on taking some action over this issue.
449469,bigugli,2010-03-29 17:04:00,6138,The local club is on board with this being as it is right in their backyard. They will also be doing some lobbying.  No stranger to stirring things up. I've embarrassed a few public officials in the past and I am only too well aware of how to utilize media when necessary.

Priority of action will lie with NPCA and DFO. NPCA may be hamstrung by a 6 month statute of limitations   The DFO has only just assigned the file to a biologist. Who has not yet seen the file. Our natural resources might just be squandered in red tape  Seems I may just have to get right UGLI"
450725,Big Cliff,2010-04-01 15:09:00,6899," This is just plain nuts!  ""MNR does not have hard proof of equipment working the water's edge, or destroying shoreline, so they have little to work with.""  What do they think did this a beaver? Have you thought about contacting the OFAH? If they were too get involved, they might know how to put some pressure on the right people after all many OFNr's are members of the OFAH and this is the sort of thing that needs to bee looked into. If you have a problem getting OFAH to help you, let me know! I'm not afraid to make some phone calls and demand answers.  Last year when I wanted to STOP my shore line from eroding into the lake I had to get a letter from DFO saying it was ok to put filter cloth along the shore line to prevent further errosion. Now this jerk destroy's a shore line and no one seems to want to act? I'm with you Bruce, time to get UGLY and demand some answers! If I had done something like that I'd have been so burried in red tape, bull crap, and threats of legal action I'd have probably had to sell this place.  If you get me the names and emails of any local MPs/MPPs and the exact address of the jerk (his name would help too) I'll start sending emails.  Cliff"
450726,canadadude,2010-04-01 15:12:00,769,"What do you mean no proof, do they think the shoreline got like that naturally. The proof is pretty obvious OPEN YOUR EYES!!!! Pretty feeble excuse if you ask me,again there just passing the buck. Wait till I see Randy hehehehe."

450746,mikethespike,2010-04-01 15:54:00,51," There is hard evidence, its just a question of how much they're willing to pay for it.  There are archived satellite imagery of the area for sure, google might be able to help..."
450750,bigfish1965,2010-04-01 16:13:00,3382,"The MNR basically has to catch someone in the act. Just like fishing. But they can order a restoration..essentially telling him if he touches it again, say hello to the fine book. DFO has more authority..the town does too, but most don't have the resources to act on something like this."

450772,Big Cliff,2010-04-01 17:01:00,6899," Someone mentioned back toward the beginning of this thread that the property owner was the Mayor. All I can say is ""the bigger they are the more fun it is to watch them fall"". See, I'm old, I don't care who I piss off. If it is in fact the mayor then it is time he became accountable. Gee isn't that a wonderful thought, politicians being held accountabile?"
450789,JohnF,2010-04-01 18:02:00,3494,"Sounds like it might be time to mention it to someone in the media, preferably someone who likes to stir the pot.

As it was explained (off the record) to me. Political risk is a large part of risk assessment in government. The more voices singing out, the better. Government does not respond to silence. E-mail the DFO,MNR and NPCA. IF you have an OFAH membership, let the OFAH know your concern. What happened here has also happened everywhere in this province and it takes noise to make it stop. Here are the MPP's concerned: [email protected] [email protected] the biologist at the NPCA [email protected] Rattle their chains. I would think that Hudak, as leader of the opposition might like to embarass the liberal govt."
452563,JohnF,2010-04-06 14:15:00,3494,How about someone with an understanding of the area etc and some skill with the language drafting a short explanation/complaint that can be sent by the rest of us to the people named above. There's no point in me trying to explain the problem when I have only the vaguest idea of where it is. I didn't used to think repetitive emails meant anything but I've found out that it's the numbers that matter to politicians.  JF
452622,Dutchy,2010-04-06 16:23:00,416, As a biologist I could draft something if bigugli gives me the specific details. I can add in the sexy biological terminology and make them feel guilty as hell.
452641,JohnF,2010-04-06 17:16:00,3494, Guilty is good with politicians as long as it's very very public. In private they seem to wear it quite comfortably.  JF
455236,bigugli,2010-04-13 00:12:00,6138,"Well, today we started a letter writing campaign in Niagara that I was going to bring forward on OFC. Things, however, seemed to have moved very suddenly.

446689,canadadude,2010-03-23 01:01:00,769,"The dune was destroyed 50yrs ago when the original camp ground was built not to mention the QEW and 2 service roads.This hardly an example of an original dune ecosystem, are we talking about the same area here?There has been developement on this piece of land longer then I've been on this planet,it is now a municipal park setting hardly a protected natural area.I think the chain saws, lawn mowers and weed whips are doing more damage to the scrub brush then a few bonfires.For years this area was a private campground which was given to the town of Lincoln who have kept it as a day use park and beach area."

Media attention will increase the response and awareness of the levels of enforcement. The managers that direct the investigators will never want to look poorly in the public eye. Good media coverage will ensure action will be taken and not just warnings. I would definately suggest contacting the local news station and newspapers. Public awareness will increase focus on this issue and will trigger other agencies that might be intrested in this shoddy work. Political knee jerk reactions can be very effective when they think they are being held accoutable to the public.

Then they are applied for by groups for conservation efforts in THE AREA that the fine was levied.  This is separate from the remediation required by the landowner.
445570,cheaptackle,2010-03-19 21:04:00,849,Wonder if that might be the surcharge added to fines such as these?  Think it's something like 25% is automatically added.

445703,tnt,2010-03-20 00:44:00,63,"I agree, give the authorities time to do their thing.  What I meant is if it dos get swept under the carpet then it's time to stir the pot a bit."
445722,HTHM,2010-03-20 01:11:00,4082,The Niagara Escarpement commision would probably have something to say as well. That is one agency you DO NOT want to mess with!
445726,tjsa,2010-03-20 01:11:00,1578," Yeah, until their opposition hears about it. Lets face it, if it was indeed the mayor who did this, he or she had opposition in the election.  The opposition will jump all over this given the chance to. How much the party in question could deflect toward the contractor remains to be seen."
445744,JohnF,2010-03-20 01:39:00,3494,Has it been confirmed that it's actually the mayor's property? I sorta assumed that the statement was made tongue in cheek and has gotten out of control. Maybe I was wrong but if not it's a stunt the press would be proud of.  JF
445752,Daplumma,2010-03-20 01:52:00,1961,"Thats a big no-no here also.A guy cut down a bunch of trees to get a better ""view"" of the Potomac a few years back.Monster sized fines for him.Good job,do you have any before pics? Joe"
446152,bigugli,2010-03-22 01:58:00,6138,The area was verdant and lush. Just teeming with life.    the beaver den  
446155,BillM,2010-03-22 02:06:00,17367,"After seeing those last pics, what could actually spawn and survive in that muck?"
446163,StoneFly,2010-03-22 02:26:00,574, dont catfish spawn in that soup and live in it...?  where is Dawgy to chime in on those creepy excuse for a fish?
446164,BillM,2010-03-22 02:28:00,17367,"  Yeah, I would think catfish could tolerate it, but I dunno what else."
446169,StoneFly,2010-03-22 02:45:00,574," WHeeeeew...for a minute I though this was a real river....that being said,...there are no silt fences or any erosion bariers,.totally illegal, not too mention the change of landscape,....Having a bit of background in this area...I know it is a MAJOR issue!!!"
446174,Nemo,2010-03-22 02:52:00,727,"Bigugli, the MNR will be all over this guy. Been there done that when we built a dock.  I would love to see some before pictures if you have any... so would the MNR."
446274,canadadude,2010-03-22 13:02:00,769,"Channel cats survive and in fact thrive in this pond, aswell as crappie, sunfish,largies it is abit of a mud hole at times. As for Lake Ontario fish using it for spawning I'm not so sure, it's tough for the fish to get into at the mouth, however Salmon use to run it during high water levels.I forgot to mention carp, there's some monster's in there aswell  The sad part is this dude ruined a big part of the natural shoreline,the stupid thing is by removing the trees,vines and ground cover his backyard will soon slump into the pond. Unless this guy spends a few thousand dollars in retaining walls and such he's going to have one big mess on his hands."
446292,bigugli,2010-03-22 13:42:00,6138,"The lake run fish came in last year in very large schools.  Huge schools of shiners ( food for the bigger fish ), yellow and white perch, sheephead, carp, channel cats, even some bows.  Water looks fairly dark with mud most times, but so does the Grand, and it's teeming with life."
445417,bigugli,2010-03-19 14:08:00,6138,"Many of you will remember my slew of springtime posts from a Niagara honey hole. It held an abundance of transient spawning fish, and varied wildlife. Well it seem the one landowner decided to destroy the shoreline habitat for his viewing pleasure. All the shoreline structure, plant life and habitat has been bulldozed and destroyed as well as part of the spawning bed.      THis area was teeming with life last spring. Nothing will be living here for years to come. I accept the landowners right to alter/improve his property. I have a problem when such action causes serious damage to our public waterways and resources. There are no silt and erosion barriers in place so the topsoil just silts up the spawning areas of the shallow bay. Every tree, limb or snag in the water has been removed. Put simply he altered the bed where schools of lake run perch, drum, cats, shiners, etc... come in to spawn. They may be rich but they is stoopid!"
445421,Fisherman,2010-03-19 14:14:00,7201,Don't know if the enviro guys would have something to say about making alterations like that.
445425,Michael_Brown,2010-03-19 14:21:00,411,"1-800-268-6060  Spills Action Centre   File a complaint. If you don't probably nobody else will either. Your right about the stream encroachment, missing silt fence and bank erosion. Just because they are wealthy doesn't give them the right to destry a spawning creek. There are plenty of ways to build a home along a stream and improve the view without trashing the entire eco-system.  If you call they will forward the information to the proper agency and they have to respond to the complaint. You are even allowed as the complaintant to request a follow up to find out the resolution under Freedom of Information.    Your duty as a concern angler."
445426,basketclam,2010-03-19 14:23:00,115,Have you contacted the DFO in Burlington?  It might be worth your while to make a call.
445437,pikeie,2010-03-19 14:54:00,380,That is probably a violation of the fisheries act. The act is in place to protect all fish and there habitat... i would give a CO a call or the DFO for that matter.
445440,troutologist,2010-03-19 15:00:00,951,"If it works the same as some other jurisditions, call the Conservation Authority that governs the watershed area. Then call the local Ministry of the Environment Office.  You can call the SAC number (above) but call and talk to the environmental officer that deals with that area personally.  I would be shocked if this undertaking had a permit, if it did they didn't follow it at all.  Permitting of this nature is usually done by the CA with input from the province and feds, fisheries act violation for sure."
445442,JohnF,2010-03-19 15:04:00,3494,Keep us posted on how it plays out. It would be nice to learn that that property owner got slammed hard. Even if there were permits in place I doubt if they were meant to allow that kind of shoreline modification so there's bound to be repercussions of some kind.  JF
445447,Harrison,2010-03-19 15:16:00,2202,"The conservatiion authority would be ones to contact.  They would have to approve any construction long before it even begins with an environmental assestment on waterfront properties.  If the home owner did not do so, I understand the fines can be quite heavy.  or as troutologist said!"
445451,bigugli,2010-03-19 15:23:00,6138,Left messages with NPCA.  DFO is steaming. I'm chasing MNR red tape. Think a call to the media may be next on the agenda.
445456,NAW,2010-03-19 15:49:00,4022,"Keep it up man.  Make sure you let us know what the results are.  Ya, I bet the DFO is steaming..  My cousins girlfriend works for the DFO, I'm imagining what she would be saying looking at those pics..  Not very nice words, that’s for sure."
445459,radar,2010-03-19 16:07:00,138,Thanks for following up!
445465,alphaalpha,2010-03-19 16:21:00,475,"Good on ya for taking action, most probably wouldn't.  Thanks for keeping up the fight to protect our environment!"
445466,GBW,2010-03-19 16:21:00,8460,"hey, that's my house....      JUST KIDDING!!!!!  Good job making those calls as I'm sure the home owner didn't get a permit to do that."
445467,DRIFTER_016,2010-03-19 16:21:00,10439,"  Exactly, if found to be outside of the law thay will have to put it back the way it was and get a nice hefty fine to boot!!!!"
445474,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-19 16:34:00,0,"mnr lands management have inspectors who do this type of compliance monitoring.  if there was work permits issued to work on their land, they would have been issued by the mnr under the public lands act work permit process.  if there was no permits issued, an inspector can visit the site and issue the appropriate fines.  also, i would imagine theses folks would be interested in this as well: http://www.escarpment.org/home/index.php"
445480,Big Cliff,2010-03-19 16:57:00,6899,"Good for you Bruce for taking action on this I too would be very interested in the outcome.  Two summers ago a neighbour got caught raking some weeds in front of his dock so his kids could swim, he got fined $2500.00 because he didn't have a permit to clear the weeds. He was told that he was being let of lightly and that the fine could have been much larger.  When we had to repair our shore line last spring we had to get permission from DFO and had to put silt barriers in place, filter cloth to prevent any further errosion and beach rock to insure that the filter cloth couldn't shift.  These guys clearly have not taken any steps to prevent damage to the fisheries. This fine could be huge and they could have to pay to return the area to it's previous state."
445481,dheitzner,2010-03-19 16:57:00,314,"HUUUUUGGGGGEEEEE Kudos to Bigugli for not only bringing this to light, but for following up on it. As stated, the Conservation Authority, Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources are the ones to call, and if the homeowner didn't have a permit, all of the above will have their shorts in a major knot...Ouch. As some are surely aware, if you don't follw the rules set out by these departments, they will throw the book at you: fines and restoration of the area in question to its original state.  Non-complience could lead to jail time. I would be absolutely shocked if anyone granted this clown a permit to alter the shoreline like that. Again, great job Bigugli.  I'd really like to see what comes of this. Darcy"
445512,Fish4Eyes,2010-03-19 18:45:00,1022,The DFO is going to be his worst nightmare. No vegetation on that slope is screaming soil erosion. The only legal way to stop it is vegetation.
445520,Paully,2010-03-19 19:10:00,712,Very interesting.. lets see what comes of this.  I'll go make some popcorn..
445526,packrat,2010-03-19 19:26:00,93,"I'm sure this is going to generate a whole lot more attention then this person ever imagined.  Where are the tree hugging, placard waving environmentalists when you need them????"
445531,troutologist,2010-03-19 19:39:00,951,"  They are stopping the ""glamorous"" slaughter that hunting and fishing present....no worries about the slow affixiation of an ecosystem, not enough conflict or media attention.  Imagine if they championed ecosystem issues like this? What a lobby group the environmentalists and sportsmen could be if aligned to a common goal of protecting the natural world....alas they are often sensationalists with little information on the topics they spout off about (just watch a lady denouncing the seal hunt get hakapiked at a conference a few weeks ago...the fine DFO folks came armed with facts and not ignorance and a loud voice...)   I digress, good on the gent who is taking action, all of us should be so dilligent and do our part to be stewards of our lands and waters."
445543,JohnF,2010-03-19 20:12:00,3494, Besides there's no blood or fur involved.  JF
445548,bigugli,2010-03-19 20:20:00,6138,"There are ways and means by which a land owner can make waterfront improvents that are beneficial for all concerned. That is not the case here. Along that bank was a thick shoreline growth of dogwoods, scrub willow, wild rose. Beneath was an under layer of marginal water grasses, weeds and a couple of pockets of water lily. Along that bank was the den of a river beaver. During the warm months, kingfishers, orioles, blackbirds, cardinal, etc... would nest there. Herons and bitterns would perch on some of the standing dead wood looking for their next meals. There were painted turtles in among the shoreline wood.  Loss of the spawning bed will gradually mean the loss of those schools of lake run fish that spawn there. I have worked on a few waterfront projects and I still can't believe the shortsightedness of this landowner. No responsible landscaper should ever be so careless. I've seen it happen a few time up in the Muskokas and Haliburtons, and the consequences were huge. On one lake the cost to restore the habitat drove the offender into bankruptcy. He had dumped some 30 truck loads of sand into a grass marsh to build the perfect beach.  The MNR has begun investigating."
445552,Spiel,2010-03-19 20:23:00,9065," Good for you Bruce, keep us posted on any info you obtain on this matter."
445555,cheaptackle,2010-03-19 20:25:00,849, YEEESSSSSSSS!  Michael
