460147,Mike the Pike,2010-04-26 23:28:00,3421, Actually Jacques it was very cold Sunday morning forgot my tuque in the van. Found some hand warmers in my box and I was using them.That fish was caught at 7am it was still quite chilly at that time.  In the afternoon it warmed up a little.We jigged for some perch to keep the young lad happy. The protected bays were warm when we returned to the launch at 3pm I had gone back to a t-shirt.  Was a great day.Thanks for the kind words.MTP
