Now my Mom is 92 and has been living in an old fogeys home for about 4 years now and doesn't drive. She gave up her licence shortly after she passed her last test at 80 and returned the licence to MTO..about 12 years ago.  She just got a letter from MTO stating that her licence has been suspended due to a medical condition and if she wishes to renew will be treated as a Novice driver.  I know there is Government RED Tape and extreme waiting periods for paperwork to make it from one desk to the next to cancel her licence..12 years ago, but this one takes the better part of the whole cake.  I'd say we are dealing with a bunch of vegetables but, that would be an insult to Peas & Carrots, Corn on the Cob and all the vegetables.  I think I'm going to have some fun on the phone tomorrow.

459631,JohnF,2010-04-25 22:09:00,3494,Why not just ignore it and let them suspend her licence or whatever they do.  Might lead to even more entertaining stuff.  JF
