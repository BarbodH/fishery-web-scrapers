I had historically always spent my last Saturday in April chasing brook trout in small watersheds across western ontario.  I have always enjoyed it, and liked avoiding the crowds.  After LOTS of coaxing, I joined a buddy in the GTA to chase some ""upper reach"" chrome.  We arrived at 4:18am to the river and there was already about 30 cars and a half dozen bonfires going.  My buddy started fishing before me, but I made my first drift at 5:38am and had my first fish in my hand at 5:38am, a little smolt.  By 5:41 I had a 4 pounder on the bank.  By 9am I had gone 6 for 20 (not including the countless smolts and parrs).  I lost so many fish to the wood and poor hooksets.  Everything before 9am was on small white roe bags.  By 9am, with the high skies and GIN clear water, the fishing died.  I managed 2 more fish by 10am drifting a scud pattern and called it quits by 10:30am.  No big fish today, mostly little 3-4 pound cookie cutter fish.  Didnt take many pictures as the action was fast and furious when it came.  I wont say where I was, but I can say I spotted many OFNers including Silvio, Kemper and Snagmasteral from across the way.     "
