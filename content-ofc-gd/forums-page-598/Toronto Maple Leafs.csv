531332,Rod Caster,2010-12-23 17:33:00,5784,"my my what feeble fans you have Maple Leafs.  I've been a Phoenix fan (the franshise) since they were the jets...and sucked for MANY years. Even Gretzky couldn't revive that team, boy what a sad state we were in. Now, we are competitive at least. Either way I'll cheer for them no matter what, it's called loyalty people...I feel bad for your spouses. (half joke don't lose your poop please).  If I saw some dink throw waffles at a Phoenix game I wouldn't be happy and would NOT support him. Some of you fans are getting what you deserve from this running gag for being so flaky. You are the waffles as far as I'm concerned.  The leafs will get better soon, there's no where to go but up...stick with them and you'll have well deserved pride when they make the playoffs in the coming years.  Go Underdogs Go!"
531335,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-23 17:37:00,0," as a sens fan who hates the leafs i still say this...  The leafs have ARGUABLY the most passionate and devoted fans in the NHL, and they deserve better than what they've been given the last 6 years.  i applaud the waffle tosser.  he probably should have waited for a break in the play, but the embarrassment this is causing the players and organization...  even worse, i find myself HAVING to cheer for Toronto because Boston is only getting better from Burke's disaster.  kessel is a decent player but he's the only top 6 forward on the team."

531546,glen,2010-12-24 14:24:00,2641,Maybe the leafs should put out an ice fishing team  .  I guess they would still loose.  They would fish all day with no hits.

It's like Christmas early with easter and birthdays thrown in for fun..  Leaf fans outright bashing their team...a team that has sucked for over forty years....  ...and who calls them slow...  Not only are the leaf fans bashing the team, but the management and the coachs too...the best thing is they are argueing who's most to blame....hahahah   I LOVE IT  Thanks Leaf fans...for giving me the best Christmas present I've ever received!!!"
531014,jedimaster,2010-12-22 19:59:00,3472,Yah the don't show up thing is never gonna happen. I think I woudl just throw the noname waffles and not the good eggo one's. The noname ones are more apprpriate as they usually taste a bit stale.

Clouston and Murray are as goud as gone and Murray got one coach too many.  I am just not sure what a send fan has to be happy about.  As far as the waffles, I love it. Looks good on em"

531033,muskymatt,2010-12-22 20:26:00,2608," Yeah I have to admit the Sens suck...pretty much from top to bottom right now. That said, as you guys are still laff fans, I still support my sens. I hope they dump the overpaid under achieving old guys and bring in some new talent. As long as Burke isn't hired they have a chance to get some good draft picks  So in the mean time I will continue to bash the laffs....why you ask?  Because they still suck,even if just a little bit more than the Sens"
531034,fisher,2010-12-22 20:28:00,451,I think this guy was planted by the NHL.  After all the NHL is trying to raise its profile with our American neighbours (they already put Crosby and company on Price Is Right) and the publicity this could generate will be pretty wide spread.  Maybe even a late night show appearance on Letterman (or more likely George Strombo).
531039,Flappn,2010-12-22 20:41:00,245,"The ""don't show up"" will work. Your going to tell me 100% of the seats are owned by Corporations? Let the corporate clowns show up...there only there for an hour anyway. I would estimate that only 30-40% of the seats are owned by corporations. ACC starts only filling up by half or less....changes will be made. I wont go even if I get free tickets....by the time you pay parking/food/booze I would much rather spend that money on a nice dinner at home watching the Black Hawks...a real team...that funny enough sucked bad earlier on in the 2000's but rebuilt and won the cup. Enough is enough with the Leafs."
531041,Grimace,2010-12-22 20:53:00,2020,"It won't work because the problem is not that they are not trying, the problem is incompetence. Before the salary cap they spent tons of dough on salary, just the wrong players.  After the lock out, they have not gotten the draft game.  Simple, they are trying but are incompetent."
531042,Jds63,2010-12-22 20:56:00,1365,"I am a Leaf fan and i just nearly pissed my pants laughing looking at the waffle pics  Kudos to the guy who threw the waffles,  That first period against the Thrashers looked like the leafs were a Junior C team, and people payed good money for that ?"
531059,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-22 21:51:00,0,sens definitely suck but our fanbase hasn't hit the waffle tossin' stage yet.  i wish they would though because murray has been dragging whats left of our cup run team since 2007.  we need a wake up as well!  waffle-gate could be just what leaf nation needs to wake up and take their team back.  it's like likely though... apparently detractors will be banned for life!
531074,Grimace,2010-12-22 22:18:00,2020,Wafflegate.  I love it.
531124,jediangler,2010-12-22 23:57:00,1923,"Maybe ""Throwing out the Waffle"" will be the catch phrase of those Leaf fans that have finally had enough. They are tossing their allegiances and loyalty to the team over the glass like so many frozen waffles. Getting kicked out and banned for life will suit them fine as they clear their Leaf merchandise and prepare to cheer for a new team. Last year a Leaf fan advertised on ebay that he would cheer for the team chosen by the highest bidder. He got $25 bucks and is now  Dallas Stars fan."
531148,fish_fishburn,2010-12-23 00:43:00,1311,I think a bag of horse manure would be more appropriate. The leafs suck so bad and have for a long time.
531302,bucktail,2010-12-23 14:54:00,1857,I agree that bags of dog feces would be more approriate!! The leafs have been putting that on the ice for 40 years...its the fans turn! As for hat trick hats.....it's the leafs!!!!!!!  That's never going to happen!!!
530924,jedimaster,2010-12-22 16:03:00,3472,"ok so the guy that threw waffles on the ice against the trashers got banned for life from the ACC and all MLSE events. The SUCK!!!

530944,jedimaster,2010-12-22 16:51:00,3472,funniest thing is he managed to walk into the rink and sit there for half a game with a box of waffles.

Patrick kaleta nearly knocked a guy senseless with bullet like lefts last week.  Some guy threw a box of waffles on the ice and he's no longer welcome??  Im just being facetious (?sp?)  Waffles are actually not much of a concern. They can see them from the other side of the ice. Its the dreaded penny or dime on the ice that could really put a player out for a while."
530950,solopaddler,2010-12-22 17:08:00,8605,"I still don't get it, why waffles?  Is there some kind of imagery I'm missing here?  Surely he could have come up with something better. (I can think of plenty of things I'd love to hurl besides waffles.  )"

They tried booing they tried paper bags. even Beauchimnin says the fans have every right to do this. I think it should be only during play stoppage thou.Or the last minute. I say waffel them to death boys! If somone wants to give me a ticket to a game ill gladly toss some out there! Id love to be behind Wilson...Id nail that   real good..Again awesome and this is from a Pissed off long time leafs fan!!!Time to act now Fans we have thier attention,..."
530954,solopaddler,2010-12-22 17:16:00,8605, Me too.  If it has to be waffles at least make sure they're frozen.
530956,Harrison,2010-12-22 17:31:00,2202," I saw the quote but forget exactly how it went.  Something around ""they have to wake up and smell the breakfast"""
530957,jedimaster,2010-12-22 17:31:00,3472,I think the waffles are awesome. Its the fact that they don't make sense. Just like the leafs. I too think that it should happen right after a goal versus during play. But seriously ban the guy for life? Thats a little extreme.
530962,tb4me,2010-12-22 17:46:00,3295,"How on earth would they ever enforce a lifetime ban anyway? Thats just silly. So I guess that there will be no more chuck a puck or hats when there is a hat trick scored. Its to bad we dont get another leafs game untill after xmas. Finally somthing to look forward too. As for the Waffles its a ""pun"" on thier season. Wilson ""waffled"" the coaching and Burke ""waffled"" the draft picks. And well the leafs ""waffel"" al games they play. It makes perfect sence when you think about it. The fans have to stick with this. They have the Media's attention and most importantly the other Fans too!!"

530982,Flappn,2010-12-22 18:34:00,245,Bottom line is the leafs suck and it's unacceptable for such a hockey town like Toronto. Screw the waffles....DON'T SHOW UP it's the only thing that will work!!
530984,tb4me,2010-12-22 18:37:00,3295,I both agree and disagree with your statement.yes the leafs do suck and its very unacceptable for a town like Toronto. However as long as the majority of tickets are bought up by the corps they will have nothing to worry about. Whats the point in getting $600 in tickets and not going? Not to argue but the ol dont go wont work.
531003,jediangler,2010-12-22 19:34:00,1923,  I think the fans are trying to tell the team they need a good breakfast before the next game. I believe as long as they throw eggos and not the square waffles it's OK. Someone could lose an eye from those pointy corners.
