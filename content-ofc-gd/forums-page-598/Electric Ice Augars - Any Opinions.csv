Sorry if this has been posted about before.  http://www.jiffyonice.com  Anyone use them before?  I'm wondering what the battery life is like?  Also the charging time?  Can they be charged using a solar panel charger while out on the ice?  No loud gas motor sounds like a good thing, less chance of breaking down, less noise, polution, etc...  They're a little pricy.  $450 for an 8"" on BPS website..  I guess that's not to bad..  What do you folks think?"

If they use modern batteries (Li-Ion, etc.) - about 1000 cycles. Chsrging time depends on battery as well. Some of the modern ones could be charged really quick! As for solar panel - I don't see why not to use it... You won't be able to charge it fast, though... Icegator sells electric augers as well. With modern battery technology we will probably have nice electric augers in a few years!"
