Home turf whitefish   My dad, Me, and the Steve (the seller, good guy)  Last April after finishing up my post-secondary schooling I decided to treat myself to a bassboat.  I've wanted one of these bad boys for a long time.  My dad and I drove 14 hours each way from Brechin to Appleton, Wisconsin, to pick her up.  I'm going to be broke for a long time but I couldn't be happier.     A couple largies from the Upper Niagara River.   A couple Simcoe Smallies.  Man, those can be tough fish to catch at times.   A couple more from Simcoe"
