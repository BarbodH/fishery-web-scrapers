531405,bronze_back,2010-12-23 23:47:00,17,I will be in Trenton at the family in laws for a few days after Christmas and was thinking of starting off the ice fishing season in style. Just wondering if anybody can point me in the right direction as to where I can rent a hut around Trenton. I guess I should also add the most important question- is there enough safe ice out there yet? Thanks in advance.

It's closest part of Bay if you are in Trenton. Ice was Ok - solid 6', don't go close to the mouth of Trent river - it's not safe. Fishing was slow for me. I didn't get any walleys, just a lot of small perch. If you need direction how to get where i can share with you."
