530955,Bigworm,2010-12-22 17:25:00,119,"Just got back from the cottage 15min north of Carnarvon. No one was on the following lakes. Hall, Kushog, Kabakwa, Boshkung.  The ice is not safe yet. My lake is quite a bit smaller and it has 7 "" but alot of slush/wet spots. There is 1 1/2 feet of snow.  Mark"
530966,Terry,2010-12-22 17:52:00,14456,thanks for the info  the snow sure will not help lakes freeze
531232,adempsey,2010-12-23 06:12:00,1498,"I am curious, is Kabakwa a popular lake for ice fishing?  Probably going to spend a day on it in Feb."
531266,Bigworm,2010-12-23 13:05:00,119,  The fishing is tough and the fish are few and far between. You can spend a whole day with not even a hit. There are much better options.
531473,fishboy,2010-12-24 04:27:00,550,thanks for the update...we're on Bosh and I haven't been up since November
531544,chris.brock,2010-12-24 14:20:00,4053,"it's been 15 years or so, but we used to do ok on Kabakwa (we called it Peach Lk), lakers down near the bottom and rainbows just under the ice (I can remember seeing the rainbows cruise by, looking down the hole)"
531567,fishboy,2010-12-24 16:26:00,550,good thing there's limited access...the fishing pressure just doubled lol
