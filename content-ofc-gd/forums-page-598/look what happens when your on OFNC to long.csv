I guess I should have got off my arse sooner but did not and I missed out on the picture every kid has tried to get the big guy in red was already here and I missed him because I was on OFC surfing the web DANG you OFC and Brian for the other thread.  Well I did get some pics of what he left and also had to take a pic of my sons letter to him the big guy in red did not get to the cookies so I know I was close to finding him here I will be up for a few more hours trying to catch him just in case he wants the oreo's.      His letter said dear Santa I give you then the heart I guess he knows Santa does not need a long letter just get to the goodies and get out of here LOL. Oh yeah the envelope has 3 wood Christmas ornaments he made for Santa he used a envelope from his B-Day last month and just crossed out his name and added Santa it was so neat to see his eyes when he came up with the idea. Oh to be 6 again and have such belief that there is so much good out there.
