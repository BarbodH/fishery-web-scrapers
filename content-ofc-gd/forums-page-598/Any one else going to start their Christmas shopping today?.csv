531505,lew,2010-12-24 12:21:00,12766," You'll be fine, everybody else is finished their shopping already so you should have the mall all to yourself today"

531539,irishfield,2010-12-24 14:09:00,26272,I'll be doing the rest of mine between now and 2pm and then back to the hospital for the night. The malls have been empty all week. I parked at the doors on Wednesday at BPS.. as well as Upper Canada Mall in Newmarket and the Georgian Mall in Barrie. Only parking lot that is hard to get a spot in is the LCBO !

531565,muddler,2010-12-24 16:17:00,623,"Back when I was single and just out of school, my best buddy and I would wait until the last shopping day before Christmas. We'd start at 7:00 am with a breakfast at som  rsturaunt and then hit every mall we could that day. Oftem the fitst gify didn't get bought until about 4:00 pm. Then the panic would start. What a roit. We had a blast Christmas shopping. We did that for about 20 years until we both got married and had a family. Miss the old days.  Now I start my Christmas shopping in July and look all year for those special gifts.  It's just not the same.   muddler"
