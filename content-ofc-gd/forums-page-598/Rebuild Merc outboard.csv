531436,chris.brock,2010-12-24 02:42:00,4053,"I'm not a marine mechanic, I've been around outboards most of my life though, and I'm not a big fan of the older merc 2 strokes,  you don't give us much details though (what year it is, how much use) maybe it's not worth rebuilding"
531471,skeeter,2010-12-24 04:17:00,1907,heres a start for you... since i have been down this road  price starts at $500 per cylinder.
531487,irishfield,2010-12-24 05:58:00,26272,If you are going to open the motor up... you do all four! Pointless only doing two cylinders.

531530,corvette1,2010-12-24 13:38:00,1765,i had mine 115 done at blackbird in pa couple hour drive in at 8am out at 4.30 same day service rebuild 4 carbs droped lower unit new power head full one year warranty that's unheard of awesome job it was just under 2000 grand
531559,linweir,2010-12-24 15:17:00,202,Thanx guys. I am think of getting a new one instead of rebuilding.  Happy Holiday.
531563,esoxansteel,2010-12-24 16:05:00,1307,"  Exaxtly I had my 60 3 cyl Johnson rebuilt and it was 1500 dollars that was 8 years ago, but 500.00 per cylinder would be a starting point, also as Wayne mentioned, motor is open you should do the other 2 as well, providing the motor is worth the 2000 plus 2 rebuild, furthermore make sure you premix yourself, to make sure your getting the proper lubrication"

531692,Tybo,2010-12-24 22:26:00,1373,It may be worth to look into a power head that's already rebuilt?
