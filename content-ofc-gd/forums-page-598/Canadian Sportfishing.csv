530060,fishboy,2010-12-19 15:25:00,550, I saw the show-nice work.  My buddy is the marketing guy there and I think we can safely say the folks that work there now have moved past the past...
530268,canadadude,2010-12-20 14:36:00,769,"Here in Niagara I run into Italo all the time on the Niagara or Port Dalhousie, he is a great guy to fish with, very polite and has some good tips.He is always friendly and truely is a class guy, a breath a fresh air around here some days."
530281,bigbuck,2010-12-20 15:22:00,2449,"Don't bash on how the guy talks, I've seen Italo at a couple of the fishing shows and he is always very helpful and humble, some of the others have too much of an ego. He paid the price for his transgressions, move on with it guys. Stoty, good for you guys, it gets your name out there for the cost of gas."
530318,Twocoda,2010-12-20 18:30:00,4130, I concur...are they even allowed to fish in Canada...bet they even cheat on their golf scores
530324,Lunkerhunter,2010-12-20 18:54:00,455,congrats g2! show was great.... gave away a nice crappie spot though. hahaha  cheers
530335,Harrison,2010-12-20 19:52:00,2202," 3 or 4 boats one day.  10-12 after the post was made in the spring about filming there.  Part of the game unfortunately.  Wait til this spring.  Been there, done it.  We've ruined a couple lil spots filming over the years.  As years go by you relieze how valuable these little gems were.  There are no secreet spots, just well kept ones."
530341,Stoty,2010-12-20 20:08:00,2910," Agreed, and thanks!"
531316,Shaun Rickard,2010-12-23 15:27:00,144," Congrats Stoty, didn't see the show but I remember the first time I shot a TV show when I was a Guide, and it was quite a thrill. Ignore the negative and focus on the positive mate  Cheers, Shaun"
531382,Dano,2010-12-23 21:47:00,719, If you couldnt see this coming..........
531384,jimmer,2010-12-23 21:47:00,2730,"Hey guys! The post was about Stoty (OFC'R) and his G2 fishing.  He has been great to me when I have asked him for advise on fishing certain areas. Give him credit for posting. Hang in there Stoty.  I hope to fish with you some day. I wish I was making a living from fishing, however, I'm still fishing even if it doesn't pay!"
531385,Dano,2010-12-23 21:47:00,719, whatever duuuude!
529811,Stoty,2010-12-18 14:47:00,2910,"Hey all,  Just thought I'd share that G2 Angling will be hosting Italo as were fishing for spring Crappie on Lake Scugog!  My partner Grant is fishing with Italo as I'm running the camera boat! I think I sneak in the background a few times though! Lol"
529814,fishermccann,2010-12-18 14:51:00,655,"Saw it , I did not know that was you. Good show today usually not so good."
529815,skeeter,2010-12-18 14:53:00,1907,you mean italo actually fished in Canada?
529831,Stoty,2010-12-18 15:55:00,2910, I was the one in the blue ice armor suit in the background in the Ranger. lol
529841,Ron,2010-12-18 16:24:00,1683,"Fell sorry for ya,  I lost respect for Henry and Italo many years ago. I tell them that to their face as well.  Cheers, Ron..."
529849,BillM,2010-12-18 17:14:00,17367,Did Grant enjoy being talked to like a 5 year old?  lol
529859,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-18 17:37:00,0,Canadian who?  To much talk and never enough fishing. Goes for all the shows if ya ask me. 3 fish can make a show. Rather spend the time fishing than watching.  OH Henry...it's a BIG ONE.......
529887,brifishrgy,2010-12-18 18:45:00,559,good job Stoty  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGy-nq09kXk
529891,Stoty,2010-12-18 18:52:00,2910,"Yet another post that turns sour.... gotta love it. Man oh man, why do I even bother?!?"
529894,brifishrgy,2010-12-18 19:09:00,559,they are just jealous
529908,Familyfisherman,2010-12-18 20:01:00,188,"Italo's a great guy, and nice job on the show!  Hope things at G2 are going well -- it's Kevin, you took my dad and I out last fall -- fishing was tough, but we enjoyed it and learned some things.  All the best, and Merry Christmas! Kevin"
529909,Rizzo,2010-12-18 20:05:00,4754,"sorry, missed it. Not generally a big fan of Italo anymore but would have watched it in support of an OFC'er. I was actually Italo for halloween once and my friend (who has a bit of a hawaian look to him) was Henry. That was a LONG time ago (long before their ""I didn't know that wasn't allowed"" incident. Wasn't too hard being Italo because of his distinct way of speaking (as others have referred to). Can't remember what my buddy did to ""ham"" up the Henry role...he did get really hammered though that night, maybe that was enough. Most people had no clue who we were anyways"
529917,Stoty,2010-12-18 20:21:00,2910,"Lol, that's classic!!"
529918,solopaddler,2010-12-18 20:27:00,8605," You might want to consider the fact that you've hitched your horse to the wrong cart.  Anyhow, congrat's to you. It's great to see someone making a living at something we all love!    Absolutely not.    Yes, exactly the way I feel!"
529927,linweir,2010-12-18 21:30:00,202,Missed it because I was watching a hunting show. Italo is a great guy. His show has alot of good things to share.
529935,Whopper,2010-12-18 22:01:00,2174,"I highly doubt it, seriously"
529936,vinnimon,2010-12-18 22:01:00,2593,Congrats Stoty! I will leave it on that notion!
529937,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-18 22:15:00,0,I've fished with Italo and his daughter.
529938,kingofthesteelhead,2010-12-18 22:21:00,140,Knew Italo long time ago when he had a tackle shop on Simcoe street in Oshawa and then went into the taxidermy business and moved it to Newcastle. He snubbed me at a weigh in at a bass tournament on Scugog and I lost all respect for the man.Some of the hijinks they have pulled on the show I am surprised they still have sponsors for the show. He looks awful thin as if something is wrong with him as he was always a bit on the heavy side.
529939,misfish,2010-12-18 22:25:00,29133,"   Ya dont say,,,,,,,"
529954,Mike Pike,2010-12-18 23:29:00,1332,"Hey, I caught that show and enjoyed it, Stoty.  Fishing early spring crappie is great.  It's cold, the land is still barren and the birds are just starting to return and call.  Congratulations to you and your buddy.  It looked pretty cold, but y'all were dressed for it.  My appreciation for Italo has grown since he agreed to fish with a Sens fan!  LOL  Keep at it!"
529959,Guest gbfisher,2010-12-18 23:47:00,0, yup.
529969,mistaredone,2010-12-19 00:44:00,913,"Funny thing was I saw it on the guide, found out it was on crappie and passed. Too bad. Congrats on being a part of it and getting on tv:)"
529991,Stoty,2010-12-19 02:15:00,2910, Who's the Sens fan?
530001,Mike Pike,2010-12-19 03:03:00,1332,"Dohhh!  Sorry Stoty, I coulda sworn you were an Ottawa fan.  That was pretty offensive, so I do apologize.  lol"
