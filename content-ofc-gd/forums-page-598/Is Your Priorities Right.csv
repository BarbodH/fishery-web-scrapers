531846,Cudz,2010-12-25 15:57:00,2652,My 4 year of old does not want to talk to grandparents or relatives.  We force her and eventually she does it.  THe two older kids love talking to the grandparents and thanking them for the gifts.  Don't feel put out it is just the age.  I however would have made her talk to at least say thank you.
