531750,Handlebarz,2010-12-25 02:56:00,3790,Brian as a kid I was always awake very early and was not afraid to get everyone up to let them know that Santa was here and he left alot of presents but we have been lucky Jade never got up early and Mikey has been the same way heck I am usually the one waking them up it sucks to sit there waiting for the kids to get up LOL.  I guess I am trying to say i would love a 4am wake up call from him.  Cheers
