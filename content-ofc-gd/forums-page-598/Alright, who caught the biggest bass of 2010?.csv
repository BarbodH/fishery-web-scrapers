531440,ADB,2010-12-24 02:52:00,444, I read that too.  I considered writing a letter to the editor lol.
530796,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-22 02:24:00,3761,"Just wondering if we know who caught the biggest Largemouth and Smallmouth bass of this past season. Biggest for me was a 5lb 8oz and a 5.0oz, never breached the 6lb mark but got over the 4lb mark a couple times.  Hope the ice fishing has been good for everybody, I'll be on my first trip out this coming Sunday/Monday.  Happy Fishing, MTBF  5.0   5-8 "
530806,richyb,2010-12-22 02:37:00,774,Too bad those bass didnt like to eat. They would be monsters if they had guts ... nice bass.
530807,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-12-22 02:38:00,76,"Nice largies !  Got a few smallies over 6.  Here is one from Erie. 6.1 Lbs(weighed)....terrible picture, doesn't do it justice.  I want a 5 LB largie next year !....I will flip till my arms fall off if I have to haha "
530810,Joey,2010-12-22 02:41:00,9122,"Well it was in the stomach of my musky, so hard to get an accurate length and weight"
530812,Roy,2010-12-22 03:34:00,13728,"Joey, you're a cutie and a smart one too!"
530813,Leecher,2010-12-22 03:35:00,7832,Not me.... been targeting specks all season long Nice looking largies Mike btw Leechman
530818,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-22 03:50:00,3761," O I know, the first was a little over 22"" I think same as the 2nd fish. Easily would of been 6lbr's but that's the game. I fished deep water and caught 3lb fish that were the length of 2lbr's...just got to find the fatty's earlier in the season next summer.  Nice smallie buddy, I had one around 3 and a half out of Sturgeon Lake...nothing any better though.  Let's continue the hunt"
530839,HTHM,2010-12-22 05:27:00,4082,I would have to say Garry2R's did on opening day. 7.14 pounds
530842,Bondar,2010-12-22 07:58:00,817,"I skipped the 6 pound club this year and got a 21- 1/2 ""  7.2 smallie  on Erie LOL  now in search of the 8 lber "
530844,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-12-22 08:45:00,0,"nothing over about 5 this year, but my #'s of fish between 3-5 look promising for the coming years."
530856,Pigeontroller,2010-12-22 11:59:00,2793,"If you insist on comparing bait sizes...Here's MY biggest, certainly not THE biggest...   "
530859,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-12-22 12:28:00,76, I hate you ...lol
530861,jbailey,2010-12-22 12:36:00,866,"i knew wiser's 7.2 smallie would show up, that thing is huge!!!"
530863,MCTFisher9120,2010-12-22 12:46:00,3761,"Perhaps that's the biggest smallie then of the season. I remember that fish, wow what a pig."

530971,kickingfrog,2010-12-22 17:58:00,8333,  Does it count if I used a 6 pounder for bait?  Nice basses!
530988,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-12-22 18:48:00,1107,This is my biggest for the year never broke 5lbs on LMB but this smally was 5.14lbs on a tourney scale  
530990,jedimaster,2010-12-22 18:59:00,3472,Both over 6 on tournament scales.      
531000,jediangler,2010-12-22 19:25:00,1923,"Anyone can catch big bass, it's the little ones that are hard to catch. "
531105,Gregoire,2010-12-22 23:25:00,1397,I got one of those musky fishing. Yeah you heard me right. The worst part is that was the highlight of my day.
531116,jediangler,2010-12-22 23:48:00,1923,"I was fishing for panfish when I caught that little guy and he was my only fish of that day too, hence the picture to prove I caught something."
531138,BillM,2010-12-23 00:20:00,17367,"I just got a Canada Outdoors magazine and some guy sent in a pic of a 12.3lb 25in bass, lol..  I about pissed my pants."
531174,pooch,2010-12-23 01:56:00,139,"I didn't catch it, but this was the biggest bass I saw all year and he weighted it in at a tourney. Caught by James Paluch during the BPS Lake Simcoe Open Oct 2010 - 8.05 lbs!    It's the one in his right hand ;-)"
531430,grt1,2010-12-24 02:00:00,638,"Well I didn't get the biggest but I might have caught the smallest!!!!  One day on a wind swept bay appropriately named Bass Bay, I got, using a 2 inch minnow on a jig, a real scrapper and a rock at the same time, a 2 inch smallmouth.  My camera quit working prior to the catch so I couldn't get a picture but I measured it against my little finger and it wasn't as long as my finger, but I could still lip it!!!!"
