The company I have been working for has been growing extreamly well over the past year and now we are just too busy for me to handle all the sales by myself so we need to hire someone that lives in that area.  You should enjoy meeting people, have a good background in sales, be willing to work both on your own and as part of a team. You must have your own car but a car allowance will be provided. this is a salary + comissions (and they are very generous).  If you are interested, please send your resumes to [emailÂ protected] or if you have any questions, you can give me a call 705-328-0577"
