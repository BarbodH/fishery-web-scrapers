531167,mercman,2010-12-23 01:36:00,7054,"So whats changed in your life to bring on the Blues B. heres a few quotes to cheer you up.  Dave Barry Once again we find ourselves enmeshed in the Holiday Season, that very special time of year when we join with our loved ones in sharing centuries-old traditions such as trying to find a parking space at the mall. We traditionally do this in my family by driving around the parking lot until we see a shopper emerge from the mall, then we follow her, in very much the same spirit as the Three Wise Men, who 2,000 years ago followed a star, week after week, until it led them to a parking space.  Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer...? If I could work my will,"" said Scrooge indignantly, ""every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' upon his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!"""

My Christmas will be blessed as I will be able to spend it with my family in my childhood  home. Been wanting to do this since she was born. Now she can get to experience it and enjoy it.

531341,bigugli,2010-12-23 18:02:00,6138,"Your right  Mr B. Things aren't the same from Christmases past. We don't live in Mom and Dad'e house, the guests have changed, kids grown up. The flavour and tone of the season has changed. No more coming and going with a glass of cheer at each stop. There would be 40-50 people stopping at our home to avail themselves of some old fashioned hospitality and friendship on Christmas eve. There are no more carolers and ""Sally Ann"" bands on the street corners. Then there is all this politically correct bumpf. Long and short, regardless of the trivial and commercial nonsense, no matter what the year has dealt us, what matters most is how you keep Christmas in your heart.  Gotta run. Still got a full day's Christmas baking to finish."
