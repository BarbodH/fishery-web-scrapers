Off to a specialty shop to get gravidlax, 3 types of sil, hard rye, and cheeses. Now in Finnish and Scandinavian households, All the best goodies are saved for this holiday. So we had to make cookies.   bread  A wee break for some early ice fishing   more bread, Pulla  And a mountain of more cookies.   Along with that there was peanut brittle, turnip casserole, creamed onions, etc...... to be readied today. Takes a lot to be ready for 3 straight days of feasting and an open door to all who venture forth. I have my puolukka and elderberry brandy in good supply so I may raise a glass or more to you all and wish good health and a Merry Christmas to one and all.  Hyyvaa Joulua"
