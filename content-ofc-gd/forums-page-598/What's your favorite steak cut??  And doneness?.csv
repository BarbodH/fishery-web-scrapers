531154,Beans,2010-12-23 01:06:00,3339,I'd rather a prime rib roast medium rare than steak...sometimes I'll cut off a couple of steaks before putting into oven if it is a large roast for BBQing another day...  Don't have it much married to a vegetarian but luckily she eats fish and dairy...
531159,12footspringbok,2010-12-23 01:14:00,459,   Like mine more medium thought. Friend of mine just opened a butcher shop in town and carries some AAA natural local beef and the steaks have been consistently excellent.
531190,skeeter,2010-12-23 02:32:00,1907,any kind of steak medium rare done on the bar b q with a bottle of heinz ketchup!!!!

531202,HTHM,2010-12-23 03:09:00,4082,I would suggest you would be better off getting 5 one pound lobsters that on 5 pounder. The flavour is MUCH better in a smaller lobster than in an old market sized lobster IMHO.
531229,adempsey,2010-12-23 06:04:00,1498,"NOTHING compares to a nice blue or rare cut of beef tenderloin.  They melts in your mouth!  Forget the sauces too, they just ruin it."
531231,Burtess,2010-12-23 06:11:00,901,"For those of you that grill your steak ""hot and fast"" to somewhere in the vicinity of med-rare give this a try....  On thick cuts (ribeyes!!), say around 2"", try a ""reverse sear"".  Bank the coals to one side (or for gas grills one side on high, one side on med/low) and lay the room temp steak on the cool side. Cook on the cool side until the steak warms and starts to grey on the outside.  This gives time for the enzymes in the steak to ""activate"" and start tenderizing the meat before they are deactivated by heat.  After the steak is fully warmed, transfer to the hot side to carmelize the outer layer for flavour.  It is a myth that searing seals in juices, you sear for flavour.  This will give you a steak with a very even cook.... med. rare throughout... no grey outsides and blue insides.  Give it a shot.  Burt"

I rub that all over a nice Delmonico (rib eye) from Buckingham's Butcher in the shwa and cook it over a hot grill for 6 to 7 minutes per side depending on how thick to a perfect medium rare every time. Make sure you only flip the steak once. mmmmmmmmm good!!

Now I don't even have open it, I just have to see the title and my mouth starts to water. Anybody else hear that bell?  My go to steak is strip loin, or any of the other names it goes by. But who would limit themselves to just one cut all the time?"
531550,bigbuck,2010-12-24 14:40:00,2449,"I cut meat since I was 13 all the way through university. I can tell you this, the most flavourful juicy steak is a nice thick 1.5-2 inch Rib Steak (gotta have the bone for the extra flavour it imparts to the meat). Only some Garlic Salt and a bit of black pepper cooked over Sugar Maple.  Meat is different now then it was in the early 90's and earlier. Back then, we used to dry age it for a minimum of 21 days before breaking up the hinds and fronts. Now it comes precut in boxes and is wet aged. Don't let anyone and I mean anyone tell you that wet aging is better. The old school steakhouses used to dry age their own meat in their coolers until mould was growing on the fat. Once cut and trimmed, those steaks didn't need a knife, a fork would suffice.  With boxed beef these days, butchers are increasingly becoming a rare breed. My old neighbour who owns Upper Cut Meats in the St Lawrence market laments that he can't find a good boner (yeah yeah, don't laugh, that is the guy who makes the money for the butcher shops, he trims the steaks and bones and makes hamburger). All the big chain stores sell boxed beef or pre cut pre packaged beef. At most, they just need someone to slice it and package it. Ask these guys to break up a hind and they'll look at you kinda funny. Back in the days of Knob Hill Farms, we kept the chain stores honest on their pricing, anyone price out steaks lately??? They are more than double what they used to be and you know what, the farmers are getting the same money for the cows if not less, go figure. The money is all going to the packers and retailers. We are getting hosed.  As for the poster above who buys the reduced steaks that are grey on the verge of going green, you've got the right idea. BUT don't cook a green steak, that's gone bad or is pretty close, don't take the chance on that. Grey and dark are more preferable than bright red. The problems these days with E Coli are serious and are only going to get worse with the corn fed beef we have now, cows aren't supposed to be fed corn, they are supposed to eat grass. Feed them what they are supposed to eat and then they don't need antibiotics, grass diets reduce E Coli by over 95%. Only problem, grass diets result in more inconsistent and slightly tougher meat something which we as a society don't like. We want our steaks and all our food for that matter to look perfect."
531727,Burtess,2010-12-25 00:27:00,901," Be VERY careful with this...  Aging a single steak is not recommended, either wet or dry.  Generally it is safe to ""wet age"" a larger cut of beef in cryovac in the fridge, this will tenderize the meat but will not enhance flavour.  Dry aging a cut of meat at home is some work... you need to have it out and free to dry, covered in cheese cloth, in the fridge.  The cheese cloth should be changed daily and you should use the cut within a week.  Before cooking you need to cut off the dried areas.  Dry aging will remove moisture from the cut and concentrate flavours.  Doing this either way will not result in green meat (???), it will still be red and fresh looking after trimming.  Burt"

We are doing prime rib roast ourselves. Age it in the fridge for 5-7 days on a wire rack then roast at 200 F until the meat thermometer says 136. Some roasted veggies, parsnips, rutabaga,  onions, sweet potatoes and some chunks of freah pinapple... marinated in a toasted cumin seed, lemon, olive oil brown sugar sauce. And a small spinach and blue cheese salad.  Oh and perhaps a few bottles of vino to toast in the New Year and wash supper down.  Then up at 5AM   for walleye opener on Scugog."
