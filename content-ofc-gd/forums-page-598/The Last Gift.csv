As always, the parking lot was full to overflowing.In the store people,mostly guys on the last ""Oh Crap i forgot a gift"" mission. Usually its the jewellery counter,and i wasnt disapponted.All the guys there looked scared stiff.One guy just bought a ring without asking the size or anything.Ya that one.....Just give me a box, i'll get my daughter to wrap it. If she doesnt like it can she bring it back......if thats not her birthstone, can she change it to another one.....  Clothing dept, samething.Guys were grabing stuff and putting it in there carts without even looking at the size,no to mention the color. But the best is the 'deer caught in a headlight' look. Every guy that i passed, was looking in someone elses cart,trying to get ideas for themselves. Last minute shopping is where i find Christmas.The Mall music, the smiling faces,the empty shelves,and everyone you meet says MERRY CHRISTMAS"
