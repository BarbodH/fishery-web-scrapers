528352,jeffw,2010-12-14 14:16:00,267,"Just wondering if anyone could give any reports for the smaller lakes. North pigeon, buller, or lakes around wren lake. I might be heading up there tommorrow if anyones interested. Cheers Jeff"
528397,fishboy,2010-12-14 16:13:00,550,please let us know what you see...any reports would be great
528399,GBW,2010-12-14 16:19:00,8460,the ice just came in 4 days ago on 4 mile lake due to all the high winds.
528421,rfmcrx,2010-12-14 17:29:00,42,"Most of the smaller lakes are frozen. so i imagine wren will be solid. You could also try lost lake, as it will be frozen. even some of the smaller lakes on the way in to sherbourne lake."
528808,singingdog,2010-12-15 18:01:00,1047,"smaller, sheltered lakes like wren and buller should be OK if there isn't current. Some of the smaller lakes up here have been frozen for almost 2 weeks. Larger lakes with any wave action are definitly dicey."
528930,jeffw,2010-12-16 01:29:00,267,Thanks for the help guys I ended up going to lk st.john. Cheers Jeff
528951,GBW,2010-12-16 02:13:00,8460,and how was the ice and fishing?
529317,jeffw,2010-12-17 01:35:00,267,"4-6"" of black ice where I was. 2 nice hits and a giant perch. Cheers Jeff"
529399,chris.brock,2010-12-17 04:25:00,4053,"-18 tonight and finally no wind, I'm guessing the big lakes freeze over tonight, I'll be up there Saturday to see what's going on and will report back  ps, the Leafs are sucking again"
530160,chris.brock,2010-12-19 23:43:00,4053,"I was up to Gull Lake, south of Minden on the weekend, Gull is totally frozen over with a few odd looking wet spots, cut a hole and there seems to be around 6 inches of good, clear ice, I was in a back bay though I also cut a hole on Little Gull (smaller lake) which had frozen over alot earlier, the ice was poor and slushy and about 6 inches also about an inch of snow on the lakes, 8 or 10 inches in the bush  looks like there will be fishing come Jan 1st"
530222,myot,2010-12-20 02:36:00,131,the lake I fished abit south of minden had 4'' to 5'' of black with an inch of white ontop the bite was prety slow 12 lakers between 5 guys none bigger than 3lbs  Dan
530303,MJIG,2010-12-20 17:08:00,227, What are the open season dates for Lake Trout on that lake?
530404,jeffw,2010-12-21 00:07:00,267,jan 1st on gull lake but some lakes in that area are open all year. Check your regs b4 heading out on a lake someone on another board was poaching and un aware. Cheers Jeff
530524,myot,2010-12-21 12:03:00,131,The lake we fished is open all year  Dan
530547,johnnyb,2010-12-21 14:00:00,3413,Yep....plenty of year round lake trout (and brook trout) opportunities...listed in the regs
530775,chris.brock,2010-12-22 01:47:00,4053,"lots of lakes open all year (stocked fish) up there, not many south of Minden and not many that can produce 12 fish up to 3lbs in an day though (I've tried them all)"
530937,myot,2010-12-22 16:45:00,131,"that's why I didn't name the lake. I'm sure if I did instead of nobody fishing it, it would be a zoo   Dan"
531444,chris.brock,2010-12-24 03:02:00,4053,"it's cottage country, and anyone who explores it knows there isn't any hidden gems, too many people, too much talk, too many 4 wheelers and sleds to keep anything secret"
