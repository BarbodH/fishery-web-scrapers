698671,davey buoy,2012-05-22 20:51:00,5505, Too cute Brian!!
698674,Joey,2012-05-22 20:54:00,9122,OMG what a sweetie B.  Well Ralphie still does attack ninja style and he's 8 months old now  Not sure when they become (not) puppies but he still acts like one that's for sure so I'm guessing when he's a year he'll be more like a doggie than a puppy?
698675,mercman,2012-05-22 20:56:00,7054, You'd be laffin on the other side if he got those pointy little puppy teeth jammed in that big toe of yours !!
698676,misfish,2012-05-22 20:57:00,29133," He dont bite me. I leave the mrs,s toes for that."
698678,misfish,2012-05-22 21:01:00,29133,"  Not sure if Gizmo will grow out of puppy,he will only reach 5 pounds.LOL  His bark is ear percing at times."
698679,lew,2012-05-22 21:05:00,12766,He's turning out to be a great little pup there Brian and you guys are gonna be buds for a long time to come.   They never grow up Joey.  Marvin's going on 16 and he wears me out every day just trying to keep up with him
698701,bigugli,2012-05-22 22:29:00,6138,Casey loves to chew on me socks and toes.  He has settled down a bit the past couple of weeks. Every morning he's at the farm putting the 120lb chocolate lab in his place. That Gizmo is cute.
698702,motv8tr,2012-05-22 22:37:00,2587,"""The Beast"" aka Rudy will be a year and a half tomorrow, and he still acts like a puppy....imagine, 200lbs chasing a moth in the flashlight beam....ok if you're ready for it, but if he catches you off guard....lol  He also chases shadows, flies, pretty much anything that moves  Glad you're enjoying your pup Brian, sadly I am unable to watch the videos posted here....might have to try and access them on my phone....hmmmm....
