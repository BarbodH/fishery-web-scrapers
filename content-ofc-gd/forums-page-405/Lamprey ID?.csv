698766,GreenCanada,2012-05-23 01:27:00,375,"Just caught what I believe to be a 22"" lamprey in the Credit River. This was a first for me and I wasn't 100% positive it was an invasive sea lamprey so I released it after taking a few photographs.  Could anyone help me identify this for future reference?  Thanks  Rob        "

698812,GreenCanada,2012-05-23 02:39:00,375," I couldn't agree more. I always make sure to identify something before deciding to retain, especially when they may be a legally protected species.  "
