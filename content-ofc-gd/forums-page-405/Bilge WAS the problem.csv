Put it back together. Nothing. Do this 3 times. Blow through it. Nothing. Finally found a small piece of plastic lodged way down in there. Took it out and she worked like a charm! Go to mount it on the base again and can't seem to mount the thing...turns out the little piece of plastic that was jammed in there was a mounting tab that had broken off! Oh well, boat stays indoors so only need the bilge on those rare rainy fishing days anyways. Its not mounted on the base anymore but I'm sure if I put a bag of sand on it it would stay put (not a lot of space down there anyways)."
