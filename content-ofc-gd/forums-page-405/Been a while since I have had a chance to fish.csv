We were fishing LSC in 14fow using harnesses copper with crawlers we were off the water before 9:30 with these 9 also lost a few and had many sheep, silvers,perch, SM and a LM to round the day.  I hope everyone else had a great long weekend I know we did with family friends and fireworks last night and a early day fishing before the heat it sure did round out a great week.    "
