698146,bushy23,2012-05-21 11:12:00,10,I pick up by 185 Lund Tyee today.  It has sat in the Grand River every summer and is stained from the water line down.  I am looking for some advice or products to help get this cleaned up.  Your help would be appreciated.  Thanks.

698285,Handlebarz,2012-05-21 21:21:00,3790,Like billy said take it fishing for a day then clean it after as it will soften the scum. As for what cleaner I am not sure.
698312,landry,2012-05-21 22:20:00,1005, magic eraser may work - but it is a micro-abrasive pad so that is your call. It should remove it. After that spray a vinegar/water mix on it and wipe after loading on the trailer - I just started doing this and it gets rid of water spots.
698316,bushy23,2012-05-21 22:26:00,10,I have tried several cleaners today and had little success.  The boat has been dry docked since last fall.  I think I will take her fishing and let it soak for a few hours in fresh water. Hopefully that will loosen things up a bit.

698571,kickingfrog,2012-05-22 16:30:00,8333,Would a high pressure washer help if used with some of the cleaners mentioned?

698580,bushy23,2012-05-22 16:48:00,10,Picked up some Starbrite Hull Cleaner today.  I will let you all know how I make out.  Thanks for all the tips.
698615,bigbuck,2012-05-22 18:32:00,2449,You don't need a pressure hose. Regular garden hose works just fine.
698620,Fish4Eyes,2012-05-22 18:38:00,1022,Let us know how you make out. I got the same thing on my boat just from day trips to the Grand.
698696,mukluk,2012-05-22 22:04:00,196,X4 on the Starbrite Hull Cleaner from CTC. Been using it on my aluminum for 4 years now; no problems such as eating the paint or dulling paint etc. Just follow instructions and I follow up with a coating of carnuuba wax.
