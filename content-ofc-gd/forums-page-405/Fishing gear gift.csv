What he gave me was a number 2 and a number 3 mid depth Vibrax Blue Fox lures , one silver , one gold . Any one  here use thease ?  I can tell their for top water fishing and can'nt wait to see if they work ."
698868,Stoty,2012-05-23 11:36:00,2910,"Very nice gesture on his part to thank you for taking him out! Sounds like a decent guy for sure!  Aren't the Vibrax models, spinners?  I dont see a ""mid depth"" model on Blue Fox's Website ?  Edit - typo"
698942,cuzza,2012-05-23 14:36:00,467,"Nice gesture  Do they look like this?    The std Vibrax Classic is classed as mid-depth - they'll take trout, bass and pike (I've had best results with the black blades like a Mepps Black Fury but I'm sure what you have will do the job nicely too."
699039,GreenCanada,2012-05-23 21:20:00,375,They work very well for me.
699042,misfish,2012-05-23 21:26:00,29133,"The number 1 spinner, for when the kings are in the river.IMO"
699081,Skipper D,2012-05-23 23:42:00,1970,"  Thats the one , only my no#2 is gold . package read at 45'o mid depth blade runs at 2 to 4 feet ."
699086,Marko,2012-05-24 00:27:00,854,Bass can not resist them especially on rivers with a little bit of current. I have few silver ones (one with the purple part in the middle works the best) i find that the silver ones out fish the gold ones for some reason....good luck!
699087,northernpike56,2012-05-24 00:31:00,717,"those vibrax spinners are great- I have about 10 of them ranging from size 0 to 5. on the #2 and 3 I have caught SM, pike, rainbow trout, and brown trout. I find they work great in rivers if you cast them a bit upstream then reel in."
699100,eman,2012-05-24 01:29:00,101,Great search lure when fishing new waters cause just about nothing will bite. I have caught smallies and pike the most.
