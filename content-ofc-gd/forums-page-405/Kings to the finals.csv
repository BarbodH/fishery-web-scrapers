698836,Dan668,2012-05-23 04:51:00,1120,Close game. Wanted phx though. The reffing in this playoffs has been downright awful IMO.
698837,Stoty,2012-05-23 05:09:00,2910,LA - 2012 Cup Champs! They're a great team who works their  's off! Def well deserved!
698841,spinnerbaitking,2012-05-23 08:04:00,1622,"Missed the Game went fishing on Lake Huron, should have watched the Game, lake was rough & fish were tight mouthed lol, any body but New York Tight Lines SBK"
698842,davey buoy,2012-05-23 08:35:00,5505,"Good game!,also wanted Phx to win.."
698855,Fish Farmer,2012-05-23 10:41:00,2234,"I'd sooner catch and eat a Cohoe, but Kings do fight better. Phx Tubes work great on Bass."
698856,Rod Caster,2012-05-23 10:52:00,5784,"Wanted PHX but LA was clearly better. Except Mike Smith, that guy was incredible not matter what the silly analists try to say to humble his talents in these playoffs."

698873,Jacob,2012-05-23 11:49:00,186,"I think they deserve a cup, they've played some of the best teams and stiill came out on top and i can see them doing it again against NJ or NY.  They're not a team composed of top players but they're able to play as a team."
698875,Harrison,2012-05-23 12:03:00,2202,"I gambled on LA in a pool.  Lucky, but too bad I pick Philly on the other side or I would be almost double in points."
698878,Rizzo,2012-05-23 12:05:00,4754,they've been looking like a team of destiny since the first round
698881,kickingfrog,2012-05-23 12:08:00,8333,"The puck hit the glass, the audio was quite clear."
698920,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-23 13:39:00,2690,"From what I've seen this year, definitely the team to beat.  Would love to see Brodeur vs Quick."
