698585,stainer,2012-05-22 16:56:00,13,"Loved the movie. I wish they chose a better villain, though. I loved Starks comment about the ""glorified glowstick"" that Loki uses.  Did anyone recognize the villain in the teaser after the credits? Looked like Red Skeleton from the Captain America movie to me."
698586,Musky or Specks,2012-05-22 16:58:00,2710,Thanos my friend  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanos  Sorry my geek is showing
698790,stainer,2012-05-23 02:05:00,13, No apology necessary. You're right!  I thought was Apocalypse when I first saw it.
699018,Mike Pike,2012-05-23 19:49:00,1332,"Pretty easy for me.  It was without doubt my favourite.  Certainly the most entertaining and the strongest cast, I think.  And I agree, I could do without that crazy voice on Batman."
699028,ld17,2012-05-23 20:19:00,319,"Ok I have to throw my 2 cents in here.  The movie was good but not that good.  Comparing it to starwars come on?  Story line aliens invade earth, and earth well.... I won't ruin it for the one's that haven't seen it.  My rating 8 out of 10.  Starwars 10 out of 10.  Jurassic park 10 out of 10.  Just so you get an idea."
699031,jedimaster,2012-05-23 20:30:00,3472, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs6hmyFXuyg I posted this on youtube after I saw the movie at 3am. Its thanos. Get your geek on.
699045,GreenCanada,2012-05-23 21:41:00,375,"Pretty good movie, but I thought it was about 20-30 mins too long. Some parts seemed to drag on at times.  Overall though I did enjoy it and was glad to see it on the big screen."
699181,d_paluch,2012-05-24 12:15:00,343,Good movie sure....but overrated in my opinion.  I'm more excited for the dark Knight and more so for the amazing Spiderman.
692963,jedimaster,2012-05-04 14:31:00,3472,Keep this thread spoiler free...But damn go see that damn movie. best movie I have seen since Lord of the Rings. In fact I would put this up against any one of the LOTR movies. Saw it at 12:02am and when it was over at almost 3am people were on there feet cheering.
692966,danbouck,2012-05-04 14:39:00,4380,"How does it compare to the pre movies (iron man, hulk, captain america)?"
692973,Musky or Specks,2012-05-04 14:50:00,2710,If your a Joss Wheadon fan you should go see Cabin in the Woods he did a great job with that one too
692982,jedimaster,2012-05-04 15:09:00,3472,"I was not a big fan of the Hulk, Loved the first Iron man, Captain America was pretty good. This movie blows them all away. The hulk was AMAZING!!!!! IMO the hulk STOLE the movie. He was awesome. If you even moderately enjoyed any of those go see this damn movie. I am a big movie guy, I see everything. Cabin in the Woods was also enjoyable but a total Snore compare to this."
692983,Headhunter,2012-05-04 15:16:00,5703,Two words... Scarlet Johansson!!!!!!!! Humina humina humina!!! HH

693077,mercman,2012-05-04 20:32:00,7054,"As a young fella,I used to be in love with Diana Riggs .That was Humina humina humina"
693144,Joeytier,2012-05-05 00:20:00,3990,"The Hulk and both Iron Man films are absolute garbage in my opinion, but the general consensus is that this one blows them out of the water."
693516,skeeter99,2012-05-06 17:49:00,109,did you stay for the credits and see the extra two scenes after the credits most movies always slide something in after but these were actually really cool
693518,Terry,2012-05-06 17:54:00,14456,I liked the movie  Hulk did have some funny stuff....
693523,Fish Farmer,2012-05-06 18:01:00,2234,Is it a fishing movie?
693533,lew,2012-05-06 18:16:00,12766,Last time I was in a movie theater was in 1977 when my wife and I went to see Jaws when it 1st came out.  Guess things have changed a bit since then
693555,I'mHooked,2012-05-06 19:14:00,525,"Took my 12 year old to the 11am IMAX 3D on Friday...shhhh, don't tell his teacher! Was definitely the best of the Marvel movies to date. Some seriously funny one liners etc.  Great flick! Even rivals Star Wars!"
693570,Musky or Specks,2012-05-06 19:54:00,2710,Joss Wheadon needs to make a Hulk movie with Mark Ruffalo. They get Hulk
693573,danbouck,2012-05-06 19:59:00,4380,Just got back from seeing it in 3D. One of the best movies that I have ever seen!
693593,Twocoda,2012-05-06 20:40:00,4130,
698431,crappieperchhunter,2012-05-22 04:48:00,2582,Seen this on the weekend at Highlands Cinema in Kinmount. I am not a regular movie goer...but I can say without hesitation that this was far and away the best movie I have seen in a long long time.  A must see IMHO  :thumbsup_anim:
698490,Headhunter,2012-05-22 13:31:00,5703,"Took the wife and kids on Sunday night... great flick! Hulk definately steals the show... ""Hey, I 'm a God, you can't hurt me... then the Hulk takes over! LOL HH"
698515,Musky or Specks,2012-05-22 14:00:00,2710,Saw it for the second time this time IMAX. I haven't paid to see a movie a second time in forever. Its good
698533,crappieperchhunter,2012-05-22 14:36:00,2582, I'm still smiling about that part and when the Hulk and Thor are side by side during a bit of a breather in the action and the Hulk has just a little bit more steam to blow off..lol.
698539,Jds63,2012-05-22 14:46:00,1365,  Yes those were great scences for sure .... great movie ... worth the price of admission !
698543,asdve23rveavwa,2012-05-22 14:50:00,2690,Saw it at the drive-in Sunday night.  Didn't get the 3D there (obviously) but was still a great ride.
698554,lhousesoccer,2012-05-22 15:31:00,442,"The whole movie was awesome, but that moment was the first time I actually laughed out loud.  Took my wife and son to see it at the Bank of Nova Scotia IMAX Theatre on Ste-Catherine Street in Montreal on Sunday.  Saw it in AVX-3D - whatever that is.  All I know is that we had to go up 5 levels of escalators to enter Theatre 7, and then the IMAX screen went all the way back down to the first level, and sound was Dolby 7.1.  Never seen a screen so big - and the Avengers made every use of it.  My son's a huge IronMan fan, and it was awesome to see him so excited when he flies onto the screen the first time!  Great movie."
698563,Mike Pike,2012-05-22 16:07:00,1332,I've seen it twice so far and will probably catch it one more time before it leaves the theaters( which doesn't look like it will be anytime soon ).  A great flick to be sure and even greater if you're a comic geek like me.  The cast was tremendous and the brilliant acting really enhanced the total movie experience!
698577,jedimaster,2012-05-22 16:45:00,3472,"So here is the questions. where does this stand for you on the all time greatest list of comic genre movies... Superman, Dark Knight, Avengers, Xmen etc... I would have to say even though the IMDB ratings for Dark Knight are higher I enjoyed Avengers much more. I just couldn't take the funny voice for batman. The orginal superman movies had an awe about them though..."
