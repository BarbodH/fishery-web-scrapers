698756,troutologist,2012-05-23 01:03:00,951,"Just got back from a great extra long weekend on LOTW. What an amazing body of water with the infinite bays and twisting channels, with tons of secluded islands to set up camp on. The weather started out like July but quickly remembered it was May and T storms and rain moved in to mess up the ridiculous laker bite we were on...Alicia could not keep them off a blue deep diver....I only had 1 in that colour and it was the definite preference of the trout.      Since walleye opened Saturday, we spent the day chasing ol' marble eyes in my favourite way, rigging leeches shallow. Managed to get into a few good fish for photos and a few better fish for the pan. Water temps were in the range of 55-60F depending on where we stopped. Really used the side imaging to good advantage this weekend finding small rockpiles on large sand flats which concentrated the otherwise scattered fish. While graphing the spots I pulled a variety of cranks and hit a few fish, but nothing outperformed the Lindy Rigged leech in 3-12fow.  We were fortunate to sort through some nicer fish securing more to try out some different shorelunch ideas, including walleye tacos.  Here are a few more pics. What a great weekend, with excellent company, excellent fishing and a mixed bag of weather.              "
698758,Rod Caster,2012-05-23 01:07:00,5784,You deserve all those nice fish... good ol' Jets fans  That first laker was a beauty. I'm hoping to latch into one or two of those this summer.  
698767,kickingfrog,2012-05-23 01:30:00,8333,That's a sweet looking package.
698774,Gregoire,2012-05-23 01:45:00,1397,Are you talking about the fish or something else?

698793,Joey,2012-05-23 02:06:00,9122,"Wow, looks like a little piece of heaven there.  Huge laker there and the pickerel ain't too shabby either  Excellent report and pics!"

698815,captpierre,2012-05-23 02:50:00,2521,Boy would I like to spend a couple of weeks on that lake.  Much boat traffic?
698820,troutologist,2012-05-23 02:59:00,951, Fair amount around but we stay off  the beaten path.    Thanks for the comments folks

698910,adempsey,2012-05-23 13:27:00,1498,"Looks like a great time!   Love the last shot, really makes me yearn for the ""north""."
698911,Spiel,2012-05-23 13:30:00,9065,Good stuff Jay.  If it weren't for the wave wackers on the back of your boat I'd have sworn it was mine.

699011,jigsnreels,2012-05-23 19:13:00,133,"Nice fishing.  My dad was in the military and we were posted to Sioux Lookout for a couple of years.  We did the Vermilion River a lot, and the walleye fishing there was ridiculous.  I really miss that part of the province, especially when I see pictures like these... looks like you had an amazing time!"
699015,fishnsled,2012-05-23 19:25:00,3520,Now that's a great long weekend! I've got the bug to get back there after looking at those pics.
699053,troutologist,2012-05-23 21:55:00,951,  Its a great boat Spiel...yours would look good parked on LOTW!!  Those are White Caps...they saved me a number of soakings this weekend when the weather was poor.
