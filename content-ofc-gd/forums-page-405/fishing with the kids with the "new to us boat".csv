698893,sash,2012-05-23 12:42:00,26,"last summer we went to golden beach resort and rented a boat for a few days and had a blast, so we decided to get a fishing boat for the family, my bro also has an rv so we thought this would be a perfect compliment to it.  we looked and looked and found a sylvan 16 deep v, live well, lowrance x 96 and foot controlled bow trolling motor with a 25 horse tiller on the back. was really happy to have the extra room of the tiller and be able to keep the kids on the lower deck if the waves are a little bad.  well we took it to island lake reservoir to get some fish slime on it, my step son, niece and nephew are all on the way to fishing by themselves except baiting and unhooking, they are recognizing the bite and when they have a fish on...they were doing so well my bro and i actually had time to sit and enjoy the long weekend as we watched them catching.not that we didn't pick up a rod and hit some double headers also.
