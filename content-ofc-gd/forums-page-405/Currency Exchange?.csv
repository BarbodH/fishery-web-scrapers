698950,woodenboater,2012-05-23 15:01:00,2277,"I probably would since you may not get favourable exchanges at gas stations, corner stores etc.. May only be a few bucks overall so ymmv."
698972,Billy Bob,2012-05-23 16:27:00,5865, Good Chart.....but they never give you the full amount...always a service charge...damn bankers....  BTW we always got the best rates at a Canadian casino......but now they closed the one at Fort Erie....
699001,wjw,2012-05-23 18:19:00,35," If you have friends that cross the border to hit the casinos you can make arrangements to buy their currency, thus avoiding the service fee."
699009,fishermccann,2012-05-23 19:05:00,655,"WHY? We will take it( if we have too), at par."
699021,aplumma,2012-05-23 19:54:00,6896,I use my Credit card as often as possible. Make sure you call them before you leave and inform them it will be used in Canada from this date till that date. You should also bring back up cash though as you get further out from the main cities they may decline your card for suspicious reasons.   Art
699023,misfish,2012-05-23 19:59:00,29133," Sad state, this world is becoming.  Enjoy your time up here,BM."
699025,Billy Bob,2012-05-23 20:03:00,5865,Most if not all gas stations will not allow me (USA Credit Card) to use my credit card at the pump.....  If the credit card companies REALLY wanted to completely eliminate CC fraud then they would make everyone use a pin number when using a CC during the purchase....same as using a debit card.
699029,craigdritchie,2012-05-23 20:22:00,1586,"Not everyone will. Lots of counterfeiting these days. Many places will not accept US cash, at any rate of exchange.  Beyond that, some days it's below par!"
699046,aplumma,2012-05-23 21:44:00,6896," I hear yaa. I purchased gas as we crossed the border last year with a credit card and paid for my Lodging at Lak Air then on the return trip stopped outside of Sudbury for fuel and was told my card was declined. I explained that I had no cash and it was either the card that I had used twice in Canada or get out the siphon hose. He swiped the card ""again"" and it was accepted. I returned home and found out that the USA and Canada are far from being friends with each other regarding credit card usage. Friends who have visited and tried to use there cards have had difficulty getting gas stations and smaller stores to accept them I can only guess because of the added international fees that are charged. It is a shame something that should make your travels easier can be such a pain in the butt depending on the merchants.   Art"
699051,woodenboater,2012-05-23 21:55:00,2277,"BB,  Most places here are already using PIN and all my transactions (cedit and debit) are pinned. Still gotta shield the keypad when inputting the PIN though...makes one less likely (fingers crossed) to have probs if your card is skimmed."
699052,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-23 21:55:00,10439, No different when I try to use my credit card at US gas stations. I have to go inside tell the attendant I'm from Canada and I can't use my card in the pump so they usually just authorize it and I go and pump then come back in the store. A total PIA!!!!  My CC is a PIN protected card. The US gas attendants I talk to know right away I'm Canadian because of the chip in my CC.
699054,OhioFisherman,2012-05-23 21:56:00,6623,"  That is actually the same here, a couple hundred miles from the border they don`t want to deal with Canadian cash. The banks here also tag you when you go to exchange it."
699056,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-23 21:59:00,10439,I usually buy my Yankee $$$ @ my bank before I go to the states but if I need more while there I just hit up a banks money machine and pull some more out of my account. The conversion is done by my bank and I get the same rate. There may be a couple of bucks for the out of branch withdrawl but it's not much.
699057,danc,2012-05-23 22:05:00,4677, You sure it isn't because of your accent? Eh?
699063,DRIFTER_016,2012-05-23 22:21:00,10439," I doan know what yer talkin aboot, EH!!! Hoser!!!!"
699066,Billy Bob,2012-05-23 22:35:00,5865, Alway's loved that name you guys use up there.....but the true meaning escapes me.....
699067,misfish,2012-05-23 22:39:00,29133," You are hip, live in the city, you go to all the cool shows, wear plaid shirts, ripped jeans, oversize coats and insist on drinking the cheapest crap beer you can find. Yes your cloths may be from a thrift store but not out of necessity, the toque that never leaves your unwashed head is a fashion accessory and that smell, well that you can't fake. You're not from small town Canada you POSER HOSER!  <object style=""height: 390px; width: 640px""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPRaD6TKLc?version=3&feature=player_detailpage""><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPRaD6TKLc?version=3&feature=player_detailpage""><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""><param name=""allowScriptAccess"" value=""always""><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPRaD6TKLc?version=3&feature=player_detailpage"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowfullscreen=""true"" allowScriptAccess=""always"" width=""640"" height=""360""></object>"
