699184,mike rousseau,2012-05-24 12:21:00,4661,I gotta try to get one of those... I know a few spots that always have gar there... Just never tried...
699188,Christopheraaron,2012-05-24 12:29:00,3525,Nice fish!
699268,jedimaster,2012-05-24 18:07:00,3472,"Cool, I wish I knew a spot where there was gar, would love to try for them. I can't say i have ever even seen one while on the water."
699290,jigsnreels,2012-05-24 19:13:00,133," I've seen a couple of people pull them out of the forks of the Thames.  Not sure if they were just randoms or if they're actually resident in that part of the river.  Most people fish for carp or catfish in that area, although I've heard of everything from rainbows to even muskie coming out of there..."
699310,Christopheraaron,2012-05-24 19:59:00,3525," I'll be going out sometime to quitnte for gar this year, most of the shallow bays are supposed to have them."
