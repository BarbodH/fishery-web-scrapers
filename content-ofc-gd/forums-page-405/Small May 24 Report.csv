698564,Musky or Specks,2012-05-22 16:10:00,2710,I had posted in my report last week that I thought the water was still too high and a touch on the cold side for the brook trout fishing to have reached its peak. So Saturday I headed out with my son to see if it was bang on. May 24 is very late for this type of fishing normally by now the water has warmed up to much and the big specks are all up in the tribs seeking some cold water refuge.  Well the water levels when we arrived were perfect and I had high hopes but the temp was a little to high already (68) I'm thinking it would have been perfect on Wednesday/Thursday.  We manage to catch a bunch of specks just all smaller fish.  Some pics      A little video and pic of the best fish  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZYmFoscggI    Hope everyone weekend went well Speck fishing is almost over time to start thinking about Ski's
