698672,Pikeslayer,2012-05-22 20:51:00,1443,"Needless to say, the weather was EPIC. No excuses because of Lady Nature. We fished hard Saturday & Sunday. Early, mid day & evening bite. Only managed to pick up one decent walleye and quite a few hammer handles throughout both days. It became quite evident that an early spawn had occured and typical 'opener' tactits and locations were out the window. Sunday night, we decided to confer with Jose. Proved to be a good move as the more we 'conferred' the clearer things became and we formulated a plan for Monday morning. We slept in and started our hunt with late June locations and tactics in mind. Location A - zippo Plan B - zilch Hit our third and final location just before 11:00 am. Located the vertical drops on both sides of a submerged outcrop/shelf and anchored into position. By noon we harvested these  (much to the disbelief of 2 other boats anchored nearby):    Dead baiting took 3 walleye including the largest. Drop shot with X Zone Swammers took the 2 pike + 1 walleye. We held the spot until 12:45 but the bite just totally shut down at high noon. Right place @ the right time.  An awesome weekend and one EPIC hour.    Back at 'er next weekend. Can't wait.  Slayer"

698688,Jacob,2012-05-22 21:39:00,186,"Great fish, sounds like a great weekend."
698689,Pikeslayer,2012-05-22 21:48:00,1443,Thx Joey. Actually about a third of that (all the pike) got cooked in an awesome Ackee dish last night. The rest (vaccum sealed and frozen) will be distributed amongst family and friends. Next weekend will be C & R. I need a rest.  That would be the FISHCLEANER PRO 5000 Skip. The cordless model is not as effective. Me and the Mrs are still adventurous Brian. Gotta give a lot of credit to our friend 'Jose'
