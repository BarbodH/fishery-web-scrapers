We have always taken a portable ""rabbit ears"" type of antenna that just clips onto the back of the TV but seeing as that type of signal is no longer available I was wondering if there's any type of portable antenna that is now available to pick up the digital signal ??"
698847,lew,2012-05-23 09:49:00,12766,I now have the info I need.
698848,Billy Bob,2012-05-23 09:50:00,5865,The digital signal you speak of is UHF frequency and is weak......but those rabbit ears will pick it up if your close enough.

698852,lew,2012-05-23 10:11:00,12766,"We just use a small flatscreen Skip and even with the old rabbit ears we could pick up a couple channels but as I said, it's only for the odd time when the weather gets miserable outside."
698854,Skipper D,2012-05-23 10:41:00,1970,"I hear ya Lew , to avoid that same problem last summer before taking the camper on holidays , i bought a new antena to put on it so we could still watch tv before going to  bed out in the middle of no where ,  it did'nt look much differant then the one i took off , but what ever they sold me did the job ok , i bought it over here on hiway 11 at the Hitch House ."
