698967,jigsnreels,2012-05-23 16:10:00,133,"This link on baitfish has been posted in a couple of other topics:  http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/regions/central/pub/baitfish-appat-on/pdf/baitfish-poissons-appats-on_e.pdf  Check out ""golden shiner,"" and compare it to ""rudd,"" which is directly beneath it.  The lack of scales on the belly between the pelvic and anal fins and the width of the anal fin itself are the giveaways.  Judging by this resource, this certainly looks like a golden shiner..."
698979,Jon,2012-05-23 16:40:00,209,"The Ontario record Golden Shiner is 9.1 inches and based on the float and roe bag size, this fish appears bigger than that. The Ontario record Rudd is 15 inches so Rudd seems right to me. Golden Shiners also have clear or yellow fins, while these are obviously red. Rudd and Golden Shiners are known to hybridize so that id can be confusing.  Jon"
699027,jimmer,2012-05-23 20:15:00,2730,I would also have to say it's a shiner based on the anal fin.
678579,blaque,2012-03-22 19:46:00,2419,"Was out this past weekend ""steelhead fishing"". Only problem was the steelhead had competition and these guys won by a landslide. Believe they are Golden Rudd?   "
678580,limeyangler,2012-03-22 19:51:00,5204,"WOW...Rudd...that brings back memories of fishing off my garden wall in the Thames River, London, England."
678582,Christopheraaron,2012-03-22 19:53:00,3525,looks a bit like a roach?
678583,blaque,2012-03-22 19:55:00,2419," Ya i thought that also......its a fish i rarely see either way so, not too sure on identification"
678584,blaque,2012-03-22 19:57:00,2419,"Think a roach has a forked tail though, dunno"
678586,blaque,2012-03-22 20:06:00,2419," Ahhh, so your the one who brought them here"
678590,limeyangler,2012-03-22 20:14:00,5204, They are pike dead bait in Europe!
678593,misfish,2012-03-22 20:17:00,29133,Waste of a good roe bag.
678600,blaque,2012-03-22 20:24:00,2419,"  Ya, they seem ideal under a big ole' drennan piker float. This guy however, and its hard to tell, was a good handful in size. Actually most of them were. Maybe a bit big for bait, although, bigger the bait...bigger the fish"
678640,Rod Caster,2012-03-22 22:14:00,5784,Cool looking fish. Are they considered invasive? Are you supposed to release them or kill them?
678644,DRIFTER_016,2012-03-22 22:39:00,10439, They look like they would be perfect chunked up and used for catfish bait.
678660,bigugli,2012-03-22 23:32:00,6138,They are invasives. Destroy and inform the MNR of the sighting.
678663,cuzza,2012-03-22 23:35:00,467,"Definitely a Rudd, reminds me of catching them on the surface on floating maggots as a kid"
696606,jigsnreels,2012-05-15 20:55:00,133,I believe that's a golden shiner.
696715,Snidley,2012-05-16 01:32:00,620,I second Golden Shiner. The head and the anal fin  clinch it for me but they do look very similar. Catfish bait either way.
696743,danjang,2012-05-16 03:11:00,148,"Rudds have red or orange fins, so it's most likely a rudd. They could hybridize though!"
696765,fishindevil,2012-05-16 10:31:00,6254,"it is a rudd,and you are supposed to kill it and call the mnr to report where you caught it !!! its an invasive species....it is not a golden shinner its a rudd..."
696766,Roy,2012-05-16 10:42:00,13728,"I agree, rudd it is. Illegal to use as bait also, whether it be live or in chunks. The golden shiner on the other hand is a very popular bait and only slightly resembles the rudd."
696772,bigugli,2012-05-16 11:01:00,6138,The giveaway on the Rudd is the pink eyeball.
696788,jigsnreels,2012-05-16 12:09:00,133,"The rudd also has a distinctly larger eye than the golden shiner, and they're more silvery in the body as opposed to the overall golden colour that this photo displays.  Both fish have reddish fins.  The rudd has a shorter anal fin, whereas the shiner's anal fin is broader and extends further along toward the tail, as above.  Shiners can get to be quite big, it's not uncommon to find one in the 6 inch range.  So I still say it's a shiner.  Where was this taken?  Shiners are definitely native to the Thames and its tribs, they are not invasives."
696792,blaque,2012-05-16 12:31:00,2419, This was caught on a South shore Lake Ont. tributary. 18 Mile to be exact
696829,hoby5,2012-05-16 14:45:00,42,Looks like a Rudd to me destroy and contact local MNR.
696836,tonyb,2012-05-16 15:08:00,1637,"Rudd....definately kill them and report to the NYSDEC.  I'm sure they are aware, but if you were catching lots of them that's not really a good sign  I've also seen confirmations of Rudd catches from the lower Niagara River."
696841,jigsnreels,2012-05-16 15:25:00,133,"  Of course, if they are shiners, I think the NYSDEC folks will get a bit aggravated if they start getting tons of reports about species that have every right to be in 18 Mile."
696928,bigugli,2012-05-16 20:11:00,6138,Send the jpeg to the MNR and they will get back to you in a week's time with a verification.
