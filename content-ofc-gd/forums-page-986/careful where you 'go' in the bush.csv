235049,Greencoachdog,2008-08-01 01:21:00,8163,  Uhhhh... the other kind of skeeter skeeter...
235058,skeeter,2008-08-01 01:43:00,1907,LOL---I COULDNT RESIST
235170,snag,2008-08-01 13:09:00,1932," No dream baby,  I bit you.  and there is no cure for love."
235186,Joey,2008-08-01 14:08:00,9122,Oh my
235195,Raf,2008-08-01 14:30:00,3495,"ohh man, i'm taking notes snag.  that's a good one.  :clapping:"
235236,Greencoachdog,2008-08-01 15:34:00,8163,  That would explain the swelling.
235333,snag,2008-08-01 19:40:00,1932,
234496,Rizzo,2008-07-30 21:03:00,4754,relocated it to the neighbours? Sure hope its like that Australian Simpson's episode where the neighbour is 10 km's away! Relocate it to our neighbours up north it would make it back in 8.5 seconds
234507,snag,2008-07-30 21:27:00,1932," I spun him around a few times to confuse him.  Actually, I was afraid my home made noose would choke him as he was going INSANE. So I decided to let him go after sprinting for about 5 min.  I'm sure you're right though.  All I cared about was my wife not standing on the kitchen table with a broom shrieking at a peice of rope at 4am."
234542,Joey,2008-07-30 22:55:00,9122,"This is funny.  After reading this post, and especially solopaddler's reply, I had a very vivid dream last night.  I dreamt that I was bitten by a rattlesnake and we were in a remote area, but some stranger had some ""homemade"" antivenom and gave me a few shots.  I remember my hand and legs got all swollen and they were going to give me more and I didn't want them to because of Raf saying it only works once.  Boy was I glad to wake up, but it gave me a chuckle that a thread from OFC could invade my sleep like that  Joey"
234615,skeeter,2008-07-31 01:42:00,1907, hey greencoachdog thats not nice what did i do???  lol........
233492,Raf,2008-07-28 01:03:00,3495,sighted this wknd        eastern massassauga rattlesnake  it's a good thing they are timid and will let you know you're getting too close!!
233493,Wild,2008-07-28 01:08:00,704,Do they really taste like chicken?
233494,Raf,2008-07-28 01:09:00,3495,"if i had to compare, i'd say bald eagle."
233501,Rizzo,2008-07-28 01:26:00,4754,I find they do not make very good toilet paper
233503,fishindevil,2008-07-28 01:29:00,6254,I think they taste like out of season spawning bass !!!!
233504,lunkerbasshunter,2008-07-28 01:30:00,2585,where did you see that?
233509,mikeymikey,2008-07-28 01:44:00,376,never knew there were rattlesnakes here i would kill'em
233511,jwl,2008-07-28 01:46:00,1056,"good think you didn't run into that while you where caught with your pants down  or it was beside the wrong tree, and you litterally pi$$ed it off"
233512,MrMike,2008-07-28 01:46:00,153,"They are protected,neat pic"
233526,Mattones,2008-07-28 02:02:00,587,i have yet to see one:(
233562,cram,2008-07-28 03:23:00,1733,Why kill them?  That's just ignorant.
233570,Cudz,2008-07-28 03:53:00,2652,I beg to differ.  I think they taste exactly like bottle nose dolphin.
233574,spinnerdoc,2008-07-28 04:12:00,556,i think anything you've never tasted bef tastes like chicken. i would not kill them either one their protected and 2 they wont bite you if you leave em alone. seen one of these at cyprus lake provincial park at tobermory years back
233577,Raf,2008-07-28 04:34:00,3495, He is 2 for 2!
233582,Greencoachdog,2008-07-28 09:43:00,8163,Very cool pics Raf! A snake has to be one tough bugger to live in the GWN!... and killing one out in the wild is ignorant. They're the best friend you never knew you had.  Too bad they don't eat skeeters!!!
233611,Victor,2008-07-28 11:20:00,1609,Recipes Recipes Recipes!?  It's gotta be the way you guys are cooking it
233615,brickNblock,2008-07-28 11:23:00,598,nice pic Raf.....did you take the shot?  One wouldnt need a laxative at a time like that if One had bowel prob's for sure.  .....I'll back some of you...it would be ignorant to even think of harming one of these babies.
233642,Raf,2008-07-28 13:04:00,3495," yessir, i did"
233654,mistyriver1,2008-07-28 13:17:00,600,Cool shot Raf !!!  That must have woke you up
233667,sturgman,2008-07-28 13:45:00,249,A French River Rattler perhaps?
233673,bbog,2008-07-28 13:58:00,665,You don't have to go that far to see them. Lots around just to shy to be seen by most.
233677,Joey,2008-07-28 14:14:00,9122,"Very cool pic Raf.  I've never seen one up close and personal, and I'd like to keep it that way.  Nothing against snakes, I love them, but rattlers don't appeal to me  Joey"
233681,tip-up,2008-07-28 15:05:00,94,Cute little bugger...
233689,keram,2008-07-28 16:04:00,585,"This snake is on protected species list. Killing it can be costly.  From Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act:  Penalty  102.  (1) A person convicted of an offence under this Act is liable to a fine of not more than $25,000, to imprisonment for a term of not more than one year, or to both. "
233693,Reef Runner,2008-07-28 16:23:00,980,"A rare sighting Raf, thanks for sharing it with us.  In my years of stompping around the Massassauga PP, Moon River, etc. only ever encountered one suninn itself on a rock.  Very cool."
