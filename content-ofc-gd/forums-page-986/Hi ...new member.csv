234883,GaryJ,2008-07-31 18:32:00,12,"Hi all,  New member on the board and very long term lurker.  Like to fish but don't find the time/have people to go with. Hoping to make meeting some new fishing fish friends.  I live in Toronto and fish within 1.5 hrs (give or take) of the city - primarily shore fishing unless I buy a boat (which I might but it'll have to be something that doesn't take up my driveway space).    I rent a cottage every year in the Kawarthas and will be looking for some tips/tricks/hot spots.   "

234895,BillsTheBassMan,2008-07-31 18:52:00,932,Welcome aboard Gary!  Do you rent your cottage for the whole summer?  I've been thinking about finding a crappy cottage on a nice lake and renting it for the entire summer and doing some fix ups to it for a lower rental rate.

Nice to meet you...pull up a chair, enjoy and ask your questions.  You may not always find what you are looking for, but what do you want for free?"
