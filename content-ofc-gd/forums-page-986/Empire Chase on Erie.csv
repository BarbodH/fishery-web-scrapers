235204,Cudz,2008-08-01 14:44:00,2652,The BASS Elite are on Erie out of Buffalo.  Good bags of smallmouth from the first day despite terrible (dangerous) conditions.  They are catching most big smallies between 35 and 45 ft.  My question is this:  I know Erie is a bit different but is it possible to catch smallies on Simcoe or Georgian Bay (at this time of year) in that depth of water?  The reason I ask is that I was out on Georgian Bay yesterday and was fishing 6 - 13 ft water for smallies and only managed a few dinks.  Largemouth were in shallow but I couldn't find the smallies.  PS  John Bondy is sitting in 7th place after day 1.  Go John!
