235146,rhare,2008-08-01 12:13:00,387,"Myself and a couple friends headed out for a run at some chinny's yesterday. Beautiful day nice and sunny with a bit of a breeze to keep the heat down. we started at about 2:30 and fished untill about 7. It was getting choppy at that point so we headed in.  Great day out there, we landed 7 lost 4 at the boat broke 2 off and missed a few knock offs. Good mix of bows and chinny's biggest going around 18lbs and the biggest bow around 12. we fished around 300fow between 40-60ft down. Almost all fish came off Dreamweaver spoons, 30ft back at around 2.7mph. All but one swam to see another day,    my first fish downrigging on my own boat!   Dan with a PB bow.          "

235214,douG,2008-08-01 14:55:00,2693,Nice feesh.  I'm thinking about trying out of Port Hope on Sunday.  Did you have any trouble with the water fleas?
235221,highdrifter,2008-08-01 15:09:00,2534,Right on!!  Silver soo bright it hurts to look at them beauts.  Well done.  cheers! HD
235240,mattyk,2008-08-01 15:50:00,2110,some really nice looking fish!
235250,rhare,2008-08-01 16:11:00,387,"      The water fleas are intense, we lost at least 4 fish because of them. I havent fished Lake O with riggers for over 10 years and the fleas werent there then. We had way too light of line only 10-12lbs and they would build up quite bad at times. I'm respooling with 30lbs Big game as I hear it works as well as the flea flicker line and run floro leaders."
