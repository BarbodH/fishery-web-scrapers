235149,Craig,2008-08-01 12:19:00,33,When are they recommended?  Trout/Salmon?
235324,Uncle Buck,2008-08-01 19:10:00,1000,"Wire Dipsy definitely needs a snubber...  Braid Dipsy should get one aswell or , splice on a piece of mono to act as a shock absorber...  if using a mono dipsy, then make sure you check your release tension... you don't want to be reeling in a loaded dipsy with 300feet of line...  Note: Don't pump the rod when walleye fishing, it aint a salmon, and you'll pull the hook out..."
235334,Bitsmith2k,2008-08-01 19:42:00,396," hey UB, learned that one last week on erie, didnt even know there was a fish on. there i am reefing on the rod trying to get the release to err release.. reeled up alot of line only to see a fish on the end too..  any tips on setting that release properly?"
235355,jwl,2008-08-01 20:21:00,1056,"Uncle Buck has a great piece of advice there about..NOT pumping rod....just reel...reel...and ummm...reel  We aren't running snubbers for eyes........braid on the rods...long floro leads on the harnesses, samer as the small dipsies off the inline boards.  You want the dipsies set so just a good solid jerk/hookset should release them,tough on the arms reeling in  a fish on a loaded dipsy"
235363,Bitsmith2k,2008-08-01 20:37:00,396,"i think i'll have to do a little playin around to get it setup proper.. you're not kidding about it being tough on the arms, i'll chalk it up to being good rehab.."
234423,Billy Bob,2008-07-30 18:27:00,5865, We fish either out of the Catt or Dunkirk Harbor (NY side) and we don't even slow the boat down in August until we hit 80-85 foot. There is a LOT of water deeper that the walleyes will school into starting in August and continue until sometime in September when the first fall type storm rolls in. The deepest I have ever caught a walleye in was 120 feet right on the bottom but that was with a downrigger. I often fish 90-100 feet of water for walleyes in Lake Erie.  I use the large dipsy's and can easily get them down to 65 without using wire line. I like 30# Power Pro with 20# Fluorocarbon leaders. Large worm harnesses have been doing the best the last few years over lures.  One thing that hasn't been mention here and is VERY important is you MUST have a quality rod holder for your dipsy diver rod.  You will not last 10 minutes holding a rod that is dragging a dipsy diver around. The pull is tremendous.
234446,PALEFACE,2008-07-30 19:13:00,10,"So many ways to catch eyes on Erie it's almost ridiculous.  How you approach it really depends on what part of the lake you're fishing. Fishing the shallow West end, guys pull up limits quickly on bottom bouncers with worm harnesses at a slow troll.  For the most part, they're fishing close to bottom in water that's less than 35 feet deep.  A lot of fish are caught suspended off bottom on cranks too though... In the mid lake section from say Pt Pelee to Long point, guys do well fishing 5 or more miles off shore.  Lots of bonus rainbows too.  Fish can be caught from 10 - 50 feet down in this area.  Here, they troll a bit faster with spoons and medium size cranks.  Run cranks on mono or leadcore behind planer boards or on mono off the riggers.  Snap weights are another nice trick to get some extra depth on a crank.  For spoons...  Dipseys, riggers, lead core, cookies Further East, from say Long point right to fort Erie, guys typically fish deep like in the middle section.  Slow trolling dipseys with oversize worm harnesses and large cranks off the riggers.  There are shallow opportunities here too, but for the most part, fish are in 30+ feet of water. If you are new to fishing worm harnesses, there are a few details that are very important that you need to consider. 1. make sure that your worm is hooked dead straight.  When it's in the water, it will stretch out.  If you haven't spaced the hooks out right, the worm will sag and spin and won't be as appealing to the fish.  It will eventually break and you'll be dragging two pieces of worm... 2.  Harnesses are a slow troll presentation.  For the most part, under 2mph.  You can fish faster, but start off slow. 3.  Harnesses and cranks work well together at these lower speeds.  Spoons need more speed to get the right action.  If you are running a four rod spread, two harnesses on dipseys and two cranks on in line planer boards cover a nice swath. 4.  Play with lead length, blade size and colour.  Sometimes, you need small blades.  Other times, two oversize blades will get more bites.  Sometimes, a 3 foot lead off a dipsey will work, but other times, it needs to be at least 8.  Obviously, different colours will work better in different conditions....  experiment 5. make sure the leaders on your harnesses are in good shape and those hooks must be extra sharp. Best of luck!"
234613,audio_mad,2008-07-31 01:38:00,28,"My Goodness, You really filled me up with info here. I got now the main idea with dipseys and different set ups. I guess it's going to take time to master those things but I will definitely try and hope for best... Thanks again, Mad"
234847,Uncle Buck,2008-07-31 16:48:00,1000,all this from cabelas shipped to my door for $300 CDN after taxes/duty/brokerage etc... this was also when our dollar wasn't at par...    As for Rodholders...  go with Saltys for using with dipsys...  
235042,jwl,2008-08-01 01:03:00,1056,"got these ones in 80 fow just 2 days ago..          big dipsies 150-175 feet back-these where hitting the fish in the 50-70 foot range over 80fow  small dipsies on inline boards staggered 200-300 feet off the back-these where hitting the fish in the 30-40 foot range over 80 fow   line counters help alot with trying to figure out which pattern is working better, when you get a fish just look at the reel first before you pop it out or try to remember how you have your spread set out there.  We even got one of our fish the other day before we even had all the rods set out.  Don't fish where all the huge clouds of bait are...I know it looks tempting but I bet ya you will catch them just before and just past all the bait  it takes a while to learn how to use all the set-ups ect...another thing you might want to take note of...run  longgggggggggg leads off the dipsies and jets..people make the mistake of just putting the worm harness right on the divers, we where probably running 8-12 foot leads on average....colour doesn't really seem to be a factor right now..but travelling does..it's quite the trek to 80 fow"
235144,Craig,2008-08-01 12:07:00,33,Are snubbers recommended for the Dipsy's?  Do you guys use them?  There is a great article/chart on the Luhr Jensen site under Tech Tips.  FYI.
235145,Billy Bob,2008-08-01 12:10:00,5865,Snubbers are NOT needed for walleye fishing while using Dipsy Divers.
