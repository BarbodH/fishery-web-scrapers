234985,nancur373,2008-07-31 22:42:00,1211,I'm looking for a bow mount trolling motor for my boat and want to know what's the smalles size I can go. Since I'm going to but one used I don't want to go too small. Too big is OK. It is a Thornes 15.5'. Here are some pics.  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...mp;#entry231850  Thanks people.  Curt
234987,Billy Bob,2008-07-31 22:46:00,5865,Any 40lb thrust of power  will be fine.
234994,ccmtcanada,2008-07-31 23:06:00,7971,I agree with Billy Bob.  I had a 30lb thrust that worked great in calm conditions with a similar sized tinny.  A 40 will do you just fine I would think.
234996,kennyman,2008-07-31 23:09:00,737,"I have a similar tinny and just bought a Motor Guide 46lb from LeBaron for $165.94 and if you have a membership you get an extra 10% discount It ended being under $170 with tax. It has the 3 blade machete prop as well (better than the 2 for cutting through weeds) . I couldn't pass it up. I'm sure with that boat, a couple of guys and some gear that a 46lb'er should move you pretty good through the water."
235013,ccmtcanada,2008-07-31 23:40:00,7971,There's a 46lb motorguide transom for sale in the classifieds section as well.
235023,Greencoachdog,2008-08-01 00:14:00,8163,"A 40-55 lb. should do well on that boat, if you can afford it... go with the variable speed instead of the 5 speed."
235051,nancur373,2008-08-01 01:24:00,1211,It's a transom mount. I'm looking for bow mount. Thanks tho.  Curt
235052,ccmtcanada,2008-08-01 01:26:00,7971, Would help if I could read eh?? LOL.  Good luck!
235148,ecmilley,2008-08-01 12:17:00,2163,"I would chose the 55 in a heartbeat, smaller motors do well in calm conditions but the minute there a bit of chop or some wind yoiu get turned right around with the smaller motors, it's worth the extra dough for the bigger one"
235173,lookinforwalleye,2008-08-01 13:15:00,4399,I have a 55 Lb. on my 16.5 foot Alumacraft and it does a decent job on a calm day when the wind picks up it just gets by and when the wind really howls it is next to useless. If I were to do it again a would go with a 24 volt system and a much higher thrust.  Go with 55 Lbs thrust as a minimum.
235174,jwl,2008-08-01 13:21:00,1056,"I have a 40lb on my Legend and it does me just fine....I don't use it when it's too windy anyways,I do however use it alot on the lower Niagara for boat control  when drifting for steelies and it will last all day no probs."
