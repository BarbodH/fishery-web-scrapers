235200,wuchikubo,2008-08-01 14:38:00,1114,"Gee thanks alot for making me feel even more hungry after a light breakfast!  Looks tasty, I wonder if there is any difference in meat taste (base without including the spices) compared to those found locally.  One's I've tried in Ontario are somewhere between a shrimp and a lobster taste with a slightly softer texture. They are yummy for those willing to give it a try."
235202,blarg,2008-08-01 14:42:00,289," ahh, im down"

235344,Rich,2008-08-01 19:56:00,3927,I don't think I'd be frying the crayfish out of the Lynn River anytime soon!
235357,tjsa,2008-08-01 20:24:00,1578," I think you guys down south are about a half bubble off of plumb, lol"
235369,Mike01,2008-08-01 21:12:00,378,"mmm...had them down in New Orleans, they were so good.  They make a great po' boys too."
235395,aplumma,2008-08-01 22:26:00,6896,  Is that why we are called A plumb a   and DA plumb a   Art
235399,tjsa,2008-08-01 22:42:00,1578," lol            never thought of that, but thanks for bringing ut up Art."
235412,Greencoachdog,2008-08-01 23:21:00,8163,"  ... actually, cooked crustacean poopies is quite good... but is an acquired taste..."
234933,aplumma,2008-07-31 20:08:00,6896,"O.K. it appears that up North you all don't know what to do with crawfish when you catch em. Her's a few pictures that will clear it up for you.    First of all you have to rent yourself one official hound dog to lay on the front porch.    Next you set up the okra frying station    Then you hire an ugly cook     Heres the fried okra ready to eat     now the important part THE CRAWFISH    Heres the plate loaded with Crawfish, onions, potatoes, celery, and garlic cloves all boiled in some spicy crawfish boil    Now the most important ingredient add a group of your best friends, turn on some zydeco and some ice cold beer and enjoy the food.

234939,GBW,2008-07-31 20:20:00,8460,"but if you use them to fish, catch fish, clean fish, cook fish, you have a lot less work in eating process.  more time for beer too"
234940,Bitsmith2k,2008-07-31 20:23:00,396," thought the same thing, till we stumbled on a fry one year in new orleans.. they're awesome.."

234949,Grimace,2008-07-31 20:42:00,2020,"Suck the head, Pinch the tail"

234962,JohnF,2008-07-31 21:34:00,3494, Sounds like a date.  JF
234963,JohnF,2008-07-31 21:34:00,3494, There's a reason we used to call 'em crabs when I was a kid.  JF
234968,misfish,2008-07-31 21:53:00,29133,"I buy them at the local Zhers here. They are awesome. The best part is everyone here thinks they are gross,so I get to eat them ALL.LOL"
234970,oncogene,2008-07-31 21:55:00,154, why not? it's not much different then shrimps
234977,Roy,2008-07-31 22:18:00,13728,DANG!!!! I shoulda been sitting at that table! That looks scrumptious! I love crawfish.
234981,e-z-out,2008-07-31 22:33:00,1052,I love them so good.
234990,Musky or Specks,2008-07-31 22:50:00,2710,Quick question whats the process of eating them? Shell and all? Or do you peel the shells off?
235000,JohnF,2008-07-31 23:13:00,3494, Lotsa steam and butter. Then you strip off the shells. Add garlic and even more butter to the white parts. Then put the white parts in the garbage. Then you go to Harvey's for a burger.  JF
235003,Greencoachdog,2008-07-31 23:29:00,8163," First you pinch the tail off, then turn the head around and suck all the guts out the ""hole""... then peel and eat the tail!!!  Art, you done good on hirin' the ugly cook!!! I don't think you could've picked a more qualified one!  Joe, that aint enough fried Okra for me to even think about startin' to eat it... are y'all on ""short rations""???  Why did y'all paint them crawdads orange???"
235022,aplumma,2008-08-01 00:13:00,6896,"Well dawg the okra was only the first batch of many served that evening. The orange color they turned was from the spices we boil with. We add beer, vinegar, garlic cloves, Zaterians crawfish boil, salt, red pepper, and lemons.  To Eat them you first tear the front of the shell from the meaty tail section. Then take the head and give it a quick suck to get a burst of flavor and the fat ""mustard"" from their. Then pinch the base of the tail to free the meat and then peel the shell like a shrimp. You end up with a piece of meat about the size of your pinky from the knuckle to the tip. Repeat as often as you can till they are all eaten washing it down with your favorite brown pop.  TSC"
235027,Greencoachdog,2008-08-01 00:24:00,8163," Ok! Thought you might be tryin' to watch yer girlish figure on the okra... the amount in that pic looked like just enough to piss me off!  Y'all must go light on the spices when cookin the ""dads""... mine turn red... but when y'all live as far north as y'all do I gues ya can't expect too much.   ... and we both know what the ""mustard"" really is... don't we?"
235036,danbo,2008-08-01 00:54:00,2646,"we both know what the ""mustard"" really is... don't we?    ""Gagger"".. if it's what I think it is.."
235193,Zubris21,2008-08-01 14:17:00,563,"Never had Crawfish, or Okra before, but I certainly wouldn't hesitate to give them a try.  Looks Delicious!  I can't believe some people say they would never eat this.... come on, be adventurous!"
235194,blarg,2008-08-01 14:22:00,289,"ive eaten lots of lobster, and shrimp, but ive never sucked face with one...braaaaaaiiinnsss?"
235197,douG,2008-08-01 14:35:00,2693,"No, no.  The 'mustard' is like the 'tomalley' from the body of a lobster.  It's liver, and it's delicious.  So are the mudbugs."
