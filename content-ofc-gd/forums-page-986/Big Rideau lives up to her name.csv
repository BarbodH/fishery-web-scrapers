Went out onto the Big Rideau for lakers and caught 2 of them....One was about 2lbs...    and the other was this guy...      32"" x 18"" @ 13lbs....That almost doubles my old PB of 7lbs.  So a great morning for sure."

234885,Almontefisher,2008-07-31 18:33:00,18,I just found out that I have been added to Team #9 in the tourney and this fish will probably not qualify as I did not have the logo etc in the pics    Sorry guys I will have the proper items next time.
