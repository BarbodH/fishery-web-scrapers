234314,ccmtcanada,2008-07-30 11:08:00,7971,Great first report Steve!  Glad to hear you had a great outing....I have learned a TON from other members of the board as well.  When I was caught in thunderstorms on the weekend my mind kept wandering to that thread about lightning from a few weeks ago....LOL.  I kept looking at the tip of my fishing rod to see if it started to crackle a bit.  Looking forward to more of your reports!

234359,snag,2008-07-30 14:35:00,1932,"Hey Steve,  Is this you?  I came across it by accident seconds after seeing your intro!  "
234397,skdds,2008-07-30 16:55:00,195,"Ya that's Me! that pic is from june 2008. The Pike was caught in the T.O islands by Alan Slocombe of ""Al's Adventures"". guiding. I went out with him to learn about...catching pike. Had a great time. He snagged the pike on a crackbait or stickbait of sorts, I believe, and I got to get it to the boat. Really nice fish, and made for some nice pics. Where did you find the photo?-sk"
234399,skdds,2008-07-30 16:57:00,195,sorry that was a crankbait...not a crackbait...but that might also work..LOL-sk
234703,snag,2008-07-31 03:53:00,1932,"  Um,  I dunno.  I was doing a random search of toronto pike and after all the fishing fury spam I found that pic. I think it was on fish ontario's forum?????  It's weird, I just recognized your pic!!!     Uh, dude, Can you hook me up with pike zing?  Just kidding, heh heh  (pm me if you can, just be cool about it.)"
235079,skdds,2008-08-01 02:34:00,195,"Hey snag, Sorry! no pike zing here...worms do work well too however. Could you post (or pm me) the link to the photo if you can, I'm curious where it ended up.. weird eh. Thanks!"
