On both weekends the rivers have been swollen and almost unfishable from shore.  Next to NO FISH for me on either weekends too... waahhhh  So, instead of driving home all depressed and such, I drove many gravel roads scouting the Maitland and Nine Mile rivers for some good looking entry spots for the fall salmon and trout runs. ( and i marked them on my handy little PAPER map too so i wouldn't forget them ! lol)  I posted this today as I remembered someone pointing a link for Real Time Hydrometric tables and i found it hard to use the search button here to find the exact posting. I hope the title of this post will make it easier to find this link for others when they want it.  I checked the two rivers I like fishing and they are both down a half meter from last weekend!  yippeee....  Here is the link for anyone that is interested in finding out river levels BEFORE you drive a few hours out >>> http://scitech.pyr.ec.gc.ca/waterweb/hydroPortfolio.asp   I hope this helps others too.  Have a fun and safe Long weekend.  Splashhopper and Botbot"
