234879,BillsTheBassMan,2008-07-31 18:27:00,932,"A group of friend and myself had rented a cottage in Mid-July on the west side of Sparrow Lake.  The fishing was rarely GREAT, but it was always consistent, despite a pretty nasty wind system that came through midweek.  Quick Note (for the Carp Watchers) - We did notice (and smelled) quite a few dead Carp.  On our first night on the water we were skunked  I had been previously warned that this was a distinct possibility on Sparrow.  Thankfully, that was the only skunking of the week (fishing wise - we had a run in with a few real skunks   )  Our second day had us fishing the weedline in Duck Bay, located on SouthWest Sparrow.  Action picked up and we landed 6-10 Fish - Pike and Bass - all Medium Range.  About half were caught on live minnows, the others on bottom lures - I landed a few on a Gulp-Tipped Jig head.  We came in from the lake at about 6pm, got some eats and debated what to do with the night.  Member Timmeh and myself decided to fish a nearby dock (with permission of course).  One of our other fishing buddies was bold in stating ""I'll crap myself in front of everyone if you guys catch fish there.""  Let's just say we're still waiting for the performance.  In fact, the dock was the best producer all week.  It had great structure:  Rocks, Cabbage, Wild Rice, and the boat channel within casting range (providing a huge ledge).  Unfortunately, we somewhat listened to our pessimist friend and did not bring a net to the dock . . . leaving us asking a little girl to use hers as we brought in pike after pike:  (one in picture caught near dusk on a Rapala X-Rap XR-8 in Glass Ghost)    Naturally, the next afternoon we decided to ride the dock again for some midday fishing.  Timmeh and I had to have landed 15 Bass - all reasonably sized, including this lunker (caught on a 5"" Yamasenko - Green Watermelon - Sunny conditions):  I did not have my scale   any weight estimates you guys have I would love to hear!    Before travelling to Sparrow, I did a fair amount of lake research, including quite a bit on OFC.  I was told that catching Walleye in the summer was quite rare.  In fact, we were staying near some fellas who said they had been lodging at Sparrow for 12 years and had yet to land a Walleye.  We were probably lucky to land the two that we did.  Seen here is the only fish we kept all week (Both Walleye caught on Crankbaits - Pale Green Wally Diver, Rapala X-Rap XR-8 Blue):    Member Timmeh also caught this SMB with absolutely incredible colours.  He was 2.5-3 lbs.  Nice looking fish! (but he'll have to write what he caught it on, I forget):    Throughout the week artificial lures outfished live bait.  My two best producers were by far the 5"" Green Watermelon Yamasenko, and a Rapala SR-5 Blue Silver Shad Rap.  The Rapala caught most of the fish our group landed on the troll.  It hit pike and bass.  Lots of small bass, but a few decent ones.  The rest of the group tied on blue lures and it really seemed to be the colour of the week.  X-Raps were good producers throughout the week as well.  BIG THANKS to OFC Members Musky or Specs, Memart and Misfit for their help giving me tips concerning Sparrow Lake before the trip.   Your tips and advice proved to be helpful!  I hope you like the fish porn from the week.  I'll be happy to answer any questions you guys have concerning Sparrow!"
234904,Leecher,2008-07-31 19:12:00,7832,Great report BillsTheBassMan  For the bass on second pic.....I'd say 3.2lbs.... real chunky one  Thanks for sharing! Leechman
234910,Musky or Specks,2008-07-31 19:20:00,2710,Thanks for the report. Glad to hear you guys had a good time. I am only to happy to have helped. Sparrow is always a fairly consistant lake and probably one of the better choices for guys just starting out.
