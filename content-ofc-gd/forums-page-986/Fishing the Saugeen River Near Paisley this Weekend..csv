I've seen some fishing shows on the Saugeen River, but we've never experienced the fish they always seem to get.  I'm wondering if anyone has had success in the Saugeen near Paisley.  If so, what were you getting, and how were you getting them?  For your services, I'll provide some fish porn at the end of the weekend!  (Provided we can get some lunkers   )  Thanks as Always, Ryan"
