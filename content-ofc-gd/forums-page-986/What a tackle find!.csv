234890,Guest lundboy,2008-07-31 18:38:00,0,"I wandered into an automotive parts store today to find that the place was full of fishing tackle!  Older fishing tackle, like Lucky Strike ""Ol Wooden Plugs"" and Dar-Devels and Storm Crank Baits, ratlin spots etc.  Mostly from the late 70s & 80s.  Tons of stuff.  Even a brand new Lowrance portable flasher from days gone by. Cane poles, Fiberglass rods.  The place used to be a distributor, but gave it up becuase they were getting stiffed for payment from tackle shops.  But he still has all his old stock.  Some out front, and some in the back that you have to use a flashlight to rummage through.  The place used to be called ""Lucky Lou's"", now it's Western Automotive.  On Eglinton just past Dixie:  http://411.ca/profileservlet?customerId=2987365  He will make you a deal for cash."
234898,danbo,2008-07-31 18:59:00,2646,Cool..I got tons o'stuff there years back! I thought he was gone.
234909,1leggedangler,2008-07-31 19:18:00,364,"Thanks for the head's up LB. Love to rummage through the bins to find hidden treasures!!!  Cheers, 1leg"
234944,Hooked,2008-07-31 20:30:00,891,"I recall when I use to go to the Sportsmen Show in the early 90's.  There would be a guy who would yell out deals out of nowhere.  He would just pour out boxes of reels on the floor, stand on a table and hold a rod up....and yell out the deal, actually, the deals were absolutely fantanstic too!  Not sure if they called him Lucky Lou or Crazy Lou?  But I'm wondering if he owned that place?  Nice find nonetheless."
234948,johnnyb,2008-07-31 20:41:00,3413,"Wow...I can't believe he's still going...when I went in there, maybe, 10 years aog after he moved from the actual Lucky Lou's location to Western Automotive, I thought he said he was carrying the fishing stuff until it disappeared.  Of course, that could still be the case....he had a lot of stuff...."
234956,Garyv,2008-07-31 21:09:00,547,"Cool...I purchased my first Loran and hand held GPS from them.  Still have my rain gear folded up in a Lucky Lou's bag.  He used to have a guy, I think his name was John, working for him that was a wealth of info when plotters were first coming out."
234957,Guest lundboy,2008-07-31 21:10:00,0," He still has a lot of stuff, and none of it's new so he hasn't been restocking."
234975,johnnyb,2008-07-31 22:02:00,3413,I still have a Mann's bucket o'bait....lots of goodies in there that I should really use more often!  I know where I'll be stopping next time I'm in that neighbourhood!  Thanks Lundboy!
234998,Clampet,2008-07-31 23:10:00,1947,"Yeah.......         it's a shame the fish are 'hep' to those old lures, and can't be fooled by them anymore."
235006,Guest lundboy,2008-07-31 23:33:00,0," Only the old timers would avoid them, the young'uns maybe see them as something differnt."
235007,johnnyb,2008-07-31 23:33:00,3413,"Hey, what goes around, comes around....pretty soon ""retro"" is gonna be all the rage, and Mooselook wobbler's will be a commodity    One of the back lakes I've been fishing just warmed up to tube jigs this year....only about 10 years behind the trend...just like me!"
235010,Guest lundboy,2008-07-31 23:35:00,0,It was fun just to snoop through what he had...  Here's what I bought $20 cash:
