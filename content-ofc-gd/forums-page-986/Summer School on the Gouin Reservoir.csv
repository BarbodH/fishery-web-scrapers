225530,McQ,2008-07-09 20:21:00,38,Heading up to the Gouin Reservoir Aug 18th - 24th. A six day adventure on one of the best walleye spots in North America.  I've arranged some prizing and there will be tons of info sharing over the six days.  Here's the lodge location  This is my 20th year on the reservoir and the fishing is great.  If you have an interest in joining the group send me a PM and I'll forward the details.  Bill
225701,McQ,2008-07-10 11:19:00,38,A couple of teaser pics:  Ronnie lets me hold his 32 1/2 incher last week - a 12 lb walleye is a treat to have a handle on.    Me running the river to get out into big bay for some late summer action - it's a gorgeous place.    A shore lunch from a couple of years ago - beautiful beaches everywhere.     August is a great time - the fish are at their summer peak and a variety of tactics can be employed.  You will not only have an enjoyable holiday but you will also gain valuable knowledge in walleye techniques.

225763,tipupesox,2008-07-10 13:50:00,167,"Have to agree the Gouin is a beautiful body of water and a great fishery.  We have fished the area twice with another outfitter and have never been disappointed, the place is a walleye factory.  Best of luck on your adventure ........  Tom"

Tipupesox, I've had the pleasure of fishing out of most of the outfitters on the Gouin and can say that while each area has its own characteristics the fishing is GREAT. Nemio is special because of the location -"

228521,Tomcat,2008-07-16 18:39:00,395,"I had the pleasure of sharing a boat with McQ for a week at Nemio's in Aug 05. McQ is an astute walleye fisherman with loads of experience fishing the Gouin. Nemio accommodations and equipment were excellent and the fishing was good. As a consequence, I've already signed up for the Aug 08 trip. Its a great opportunity for some good fun and good fishing as well as a chance to learn a little from a walleye expert. Hope to see some OFNers join us."

235192,McQ,2008-08-01 14:15:00,38,"We leave on the 18th of August, still room for a couple of adventurers.  The fishing is reported ""GREAT"" - a ton of bigger fish are being caught this year and because of the higher water in areas where they have never been before so there is even more water to explore.  I'll be in a different area the week before and it looks promising too."
