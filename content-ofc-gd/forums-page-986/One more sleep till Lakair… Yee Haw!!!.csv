234989,Beans,2008-07-31 22:50:00,3339,"Say ""Hi"" to Leslie and Kevin from the gang at OFC for us..."
235025,wvmedic,2008-08-01 00:15:00,144,Will do Beans.  Jeff.
235028,Greencoachdog,2008-08-01 00:27:00,8163,Hope you catch bunches of big fish Jeff!!!   Could you swing by and pick me up on the way???
235048,Gerry,2008-08-01 01:19:00,257,"I'll be out that way this weekend so if you see this big white Ranger, holler and I'll come over. I'll be up the Arm a bit further at my brother's place but I'll be cruising on Sunday."
235099,wvmedic,2008-08-01 03:27:00,144,"GCD, we would have to swing a little south to pick you up Brother but I would like to meet you. Wish I could make the September OFC G2G but it just aint in the cards.  Hope to get to one of the G2G soon though...  Gerry I will keep an eye out for you, I think we will be spending some time east of Squaw Island where it opens up and around the islands beyond there if memory serves me correct. It has been 25 years though, that is where we fished mostly when I was a kid, and some west of warren bay.   Jeff."
235132,Seaweed,2008-08-01 10:22:00,135,We will see you up there WVMedic.  I am leaving Ottawa today... for the West Arm.  Going to enjoy a week of paradise in one of my favorite little fishing holes in Ontario.  Can't wait.... could hardly sleep.  Hope I don't forget the boat.  A nice report should be coming next week.
