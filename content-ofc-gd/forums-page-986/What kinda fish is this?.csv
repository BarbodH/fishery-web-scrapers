234712,holdfast,2008-07-31 04:44:00,1813,That would be a Living fossil.  A Bowfin
234720,Musky or Specks,2008-07-31 06:07:00,2710,Yup thats a bowfin. You can alays tell by the eye on the tail
234722,Raf,2008-07-31 06:10:00,3495,that's about as close as i like getting to them..nasty things with an attitude.  here's what they look like a little younger  
234728,Cudz,2008-07-31 08:39:00,2652,I kinda like them.  I caught a 4 pound bowfin once while fishing for LM and it destroyed my spinnerbait.  Got to love a fish that is only 4 pounds and will demo a lure. I thought I had a 10 pound LM on when it hit.
234741,Greencoachdog,2008-07-31 11:06:00,8163,  Awwww! Now ain't that cute!... The Musky guy is skeered of a little ol' Grinnel!!!
234742,Roy,2008-07-31 11:06:00,13728,"One thing for sure, you don't want to be lipping them."
234743,modny,2008-07-31 11:09:00,502,they are good eating.  i love them served with a side of sauteed garbage and a nice tall glass of sewer water
234756,Billy Bob,2008-07-31 11:41:00,5865, Sounds like the same thing we use to garnish sewer trout here.
234759,Greencoachdog,2008-07-31 11:45:00,8163,"  They are edible, but the flesh is mushy and only fit for a fish soup."
234767,modny,2008-07-31 12:11:00,502,   i just puked in my mouth a little bit
234769,Greencoachdog,2008-07-31 12:18:00,8163, Oh yeah?... well let's see if we can't get some of that on the keyboard!  Look at this!!! http://www.911caviar.com/miva/merchant.mvc...an_black_bowfin
234775,ecmilley,2008-07-31 12:39:00,2163,"well it's cetainly not a atlantic salmon, must be a bowfin"
234786,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-31 13:18:00,3761,"O ya its a bowfin. I will almost guarantee i will have of photo of myself and a bowfin when i get back from Kingston. Every year we catch these fish and as said we always think they are going to be a 10 pound largemouth, these things grow pretty big my pappa caught one 2 years ago and weighed 8 1/2 pounds no lie. My biggest is around 4lbs. Mean fish but they give lot's of fight!"
234827,Rich,2008-07-31 15:32:00,3927,No fair I want to catch one!
234836,Rizzo,2008-07-31 16:17:00,4754,"ooooh that is the dreaded ""mother-in-law fish"". Will go straight for the ol gonads and won't let go"
234848,highdrifter,2008-07-31 16:49:00,2534,Coelacanth!!  bowfin it is.  I've heard the term dogfish as well.  Feisty buggers though.  I've had some run ins with em.  Like Roy said.  Don't lip em.  Their mouthparts are made for crushing.  I think I read somewhere that their bite pressure is the strongest of any fresh water fish!  I still think they're pretty though.  ahhh lookit the little thing..  it's soo cute!  HD
234849,BFSC Kevin,2008-07-31 16:53:00,1351,bowfin aka dog fish
234852,highdrifter,2008-07-31 17:05:00,2534," Cmon down brotha!  We could sight fish for them exclusively.  They luuuvv worms, and they fight like bass on speed!"
