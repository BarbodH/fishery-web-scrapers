235302,Craig,2008-08-01 17:49:00,33,Saw this in the CTC flyer today.  It's says it's good for trolling motors.  Is this a lighter option for my trolling motor/canoe set up than having to lug the heavy battery around?  Would it last a day?  Thanks
235306,Terry,2008-08-01 18:11:00,14456,"well that is a question that is hard to answer without you yelling us what you have now and how long it lasts  but without info a   Motomaster Nautilus Starting & Deep Cycle Battery  From $89.99 10-2499 Amp Hour Capacity: 70, 10-2799 Amp Hour Capacity: 93.. and the one you are looking at is  33AH deep-cycle battery, ideal for powering trolling motors  so it will last 1/3 as long as the regular battery so if you battery is about the same as the  Motomaster Nautilus Starting & Deep Cycle Battery with Amp Hour Capacity: 93  and if it will run your motor/canoe for 3 days then the booster pack will last one day...if that helps"
235308,Craig,2008-08-01 18:17:00,33,"That's exactly what I wanted to know. Terry, thank you very much."
235313,Rich,2008-08-01 18:32:00,3927,Runs mine about 6-8 hours running hard. Very convenient for my needs.
235314,Craig,2008-08-01 18:34:00,33,That's not bad at all.  I have a little generator back at camp that I'd be able to recharge it with. Is it heavy?
235319,Rich,2008-08-01 18:41:00,3927,Very light in comparison to a deep cycle battery. Maybe 20 - 25lbs. The handle is also much more convenient to carry it around than the plastic straps on batteries.  The other features seem to come in handy more often than I thought too. The air pump is kinda weak though. Good for bike tires that's about it.
