234983,JohnF,2008-07-31 22:38:00,3494,"So I went into a Dollarama store in some little bitty burg on Georgian Bay and there were all these green lizards - so I bought some. Frankly, I think they'll scare the crap outa my resident SMB but he says they work, so I'm loading up, next time out, with 8"" Smoke/Chartreuse Rattle Lizards. We'll see how they work.  I also grabbed some 8"" Rattle Ribbon Tail Worms in motor oil and purple colours plus a few packs of Storm Hair Jigs. The hair jigs look big enuf fer a smallish musky to feed on - I've caught smaller wgsf, but it'll be fun scaring the snot outa the local fish population. They aren't biting anyway. If I start catching living fish on these peculiar pieces of rigging, then Dawg is my new hero, along with the guy who invented Dollarama stores.  It just occurred to me that a snake smaller than these plastic lizards scared my wife this weekend on Manitoulin Island. Hopefully the fish have bigger cojones than my wife - hmm - I'd better work on that statement. Ignore it fer now.  JF"

234988,danbo,2008-07-31 22:47:00,2646,John..don't help that crazy Redneck or his head will swell even more!
234992,Greencoachdog,2008-07-31 22:56:00,8163,"John, I think a 4"" plastic lizard will do better for your creek SMB. The 8"" are a LMB bait, and you won't have to worry about catching a bunch of dinks on an 8""er, when that Largie eats that 8"" lizard... it'll be a good solid fish!"
234995,JohnF,2008-07-31 23:08:00,3494," So that's a gay-ron-tee that I'll only get PB largemouths with the 8"" bait? I'm takin' a whole herd of them the next time I go to Garry2r's. Yee-haw! No more dinks.  JF"
234999,JohnF,2008-07-31 23:11:00,3494," Now ya tell me. I was just fishin' fer lakers on manitoulin on Tuesday. We had just about reached the point where we'd jig with Tinkerbells if we'd had any, and all of a sudden we got a doubleheader of little bitty lakers, but lakers nonetheless. We ate 'em both. Of course I'm not sure my BIL woulda stopped the big boat fer any pansy jiggin"".  JF"
