Well I can't offer too much as I have a cottage rented in that general area a week from now, but have never actually been up there yet. I did however find a map of the lake at anglers atlas. It seems to hold small and largemouth bass, muskie and perch and seems to be a moderately deep weed free lake. There seems to be many accessable lakes up there within about a 10 minute drive.  http://www.anglersatlas.com/lakes/25336/  This is a map for the lake, you will need to register to download it but there are many excellent maps here, so it seems worth it to do so."
