234646,Garyv,2008-07-31 02:16:00,547,"The beginning of June a buddy and I took a fishing trip north, to a somewhat remote area.  I believe others that post here have also have been there so the question is where are we and what is the town's name....and this is all there is one store.  I'll post the answer in a day or so unless someone gets it first.  "
234647,Rich,2008-07-31 02:17:00,3927,Random guess: Gowganda?
234648,Garyv,2008-07-31 02:20:00,547, Nope Gowganda is a thriving metropolis compare to this place!
234652,Nemo,2008-07-31 02:21:00,727,Bisco ?
234654,Whopper,2008-07-31 02:21:00,2174,I don't have a clue Gary but I'm glad to hear you went fishing
234656,Garyv,2008-07-31 02:22:00,547,  Geeze that was quick!!!!!
234659,bassmaster4,2008-07-31 02:24:00,801,gogama? woops didnt see the reply above LOL
234660,Nemo,2008-07-31 02:26:00,727,Bisco General Store here are some old photos  http://www.ontarioabandonedplaces.com/bisco/bisco.asp
234689,Canuck,2008-07-31 03:18:00,491,Been there.  We launched a canoe trip years ago and went from Bisco up to near Chapleau by canoe.  Great country.  Portaging across the height of land there is no picnic though.  The rivers dry up into wandering swamps for about 4 miles before you start to pick up the north flowing river.  The road into bisco isn't really a road if I recall.  Hard to believe anyone still lives there.
234694,solopaddler,2008-07-31 03:23:00,8605,Yep that be Bisco. That stinkin' Sultan Road has me cursed. Every time I've travelled it (except  for once) I've blown a tire. I swear the rocks are sharper up there or something.
234697,sconceptor,2008-07-31 03:27:00,146,"Bisco.......was there last year.....Izumi or somebody did a show on it this year.......road is fine....I'd drive a hybrid honda civic down it if that's all I owned.   It's on a major road used for the lumber Industry and Bisco is a ""resort"" hamlet  so the road is always in decent shape......now after a big rain storm it might be tough.....Roads past Kipiwa in Quebec were much worse, but improving as the logging keeps going to the new areas....."
234698,modny,2008-07-31 03:33:00,502,"  yea man, thats a rough road. i have travelled it many a time.  i drove my 88 jeep cherokee right into a HOLE on that road. it gets washed out pretty bad after serious storms.  i remember driving through numerous tropical storms late at night on that road also..."
234724,Musky or Specks,2008-07-31 06:12:00,2710,Some of the best drive to zander fishing there is.
234750,Greencoachdog,2008-07-31 11:28:00,8163,So now that we know where you were... what did you catch???
234763,blaque,2008-07-31 11:55:00,2419,Population of 22! in the off season. Yowza! I couldnt even imagine.......although theres some days i wish i only had 22 people to deal with lol
234932,kuhaman,2008-07-31 20:07:00,503,"Good old bisco, Ive been goin there every summer for the last 20 years and the fishing is always awesome.The sultan road sure can be nasty sometimes but its well worth the drive. The pic in my avatar is a pic of bisco."
234959,Garyv,2008-07-31 21:25:00,547,"   Walleye and Pike...Weather was very rainy with a fair amount of cold and warm fronts.  We got out every day some were better than others.  One day great luck on black and silver 2 to 4"" rapalas another red and white spinners.  You had to keep switching lures to see what they wanted.  Stayed at Ritchie's ""End of Trail Lodge"" now owned by a lady, Erin Drysdale (sp?) Did the plan where they provide the food and you make it yourself in your cabin when you want it.  Both Paul and I really liked this plan.  We didn't have to do any shopping or drag our food in, what they supplied  was great, plenty of it and you didn't have to adhere to any schedule.  We both would do it again anytime.  The Fishin Canada bunch did a show this year from Ritchies but we booked before we saw the show."
