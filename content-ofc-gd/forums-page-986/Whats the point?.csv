235005,Raf,2008-07-31 23:32:00,3495,"Jigger, I think the landscape has changed a great deal since the days of the old UofT board or even boards like this one that came after.  They've become much more popular. With that, certainly comes a lot of good but also a few negatives.  Many peopel have taken things to private msgs and/or smaller more specialized sites.  People are still willing to help out though, maybe through different means.  ...and no, never once did Jigs ask for spots."
235011,MCTFisher9120,2008-07-31 23:38:00,3761,Thats a 100 now!!
235012,ccmtcanada,2008-07-31 23:39:00,7971," No worries Jigger!  From what I've heard from guys like Sinker, you are a really great guy....and if he'd have you on his boat anytime, then the same goes for me too.  I know you never asked for spots....threads tend to go off on tangents sometimes.  Anyhow...hope you're having a better day today."
235015,GBW,2008-07-31 23:43:00,8460,"before GCD says it, is it group hug time?    J/K  HAHA"
235016,JFR,2008-07-31 23:46:00,498," It is quite understandable to have an off day.  I takes a pretty big person to admit it.  As seen, many made lite of the entire thread.  No harm, no faul.  Just John"
235017,Mark Kulik,2008-07-31 23:51:00,348,"WE all have dad days, dude I just wanted you to chill and enjoy the sport! have a great season.  Mark"
235033,lookinforwalleye,2008-08-01 00:44:00,4399,  Just don`t take this whole thing to seriously it`s only fishing for crying out load!!!

235004,johnnyb,2008-07-31 23:31:00,3413,"Well that's the great thing about this board... a lot of the people on are down right honest, and speak their minds.  We all have bad days...and there's certainly nothing wrong with being reminded that we should ask ourselves why we DO post every once in a while...kind of like ""you should constantly look at life from a different perspective"" a la Dead Poet's Society"

234568,solopaddler,2008-07-30 23:53:00,8605," I'm guessing your question is rhetorical.  You know as well as I do Roy that's the way most members think.  That's why this board is so popular. It's strength is in it's members and over time has attracted a singularly outstanding group of regular contributors.  As far as sharing info goes everyone's different. Some guys like to read In Fisherman, other guys like to read the more esoteric ramblings found in Sports Afield or Outdoor Life.  Personally I have a more esoteric bent when it comes to my reading and writing.  Each to his own.  If someone asks me directly for info I'm always happy to respond  ."
234606,blarg,2008-07-31 01:16:00,289,"this board has been very helpful to me, i've done plenty of fishing but fishing nipissing for walleye and bass was new to me, and other questions ive asked have been answered, now, not every answer is a goldmine      but thats to be expected.  I have caught some fish, and i would have posted some results by now, if i could find the damn usb cable for my camera..  anywhoo, if i knew that everyone fished the way i think we all should then i suppose i and alot of others would be more forthcoming in general (not just on here) but there are alot of people out there that have the attitude of ""its just a fish"""
234631,fishdawg,2008-07-31 01:53:00,912, well said there Boostnawd there's only soo much spare time nowadays for the computer... the few moment i get i'll share specific info with a close network of pals I can trust & and as well through PM's

I think the water is to clear, or warm or there are too many rocks or weeds. Its not me, thats for sure hahaha.....no seriously PM me please"

I am seriously considering painting my boat black with a white stripe down the middle. The OFC'ers that I have shared a boat with were more than generous with their information and teaching...however I must be a very poor student. I would be over the moon if I was able to post some fish porn, and one day it will happen. As long as I keep trying, and experimenting one day I will hit the formula for that day."

234495,Clampet,2008-07-30 21:00:00,1947,"This whole board thingy is about entertainment. Fishing is entertainment, unless you do it for a living, then it ain't fun anymore.  If members are posting stuff you don't feel is relevant, don't get all upset about it.  You are taking this thing way too seriously."
234498,Wild,2008-07-30 21:04:00,704, And the fun begins! 
234502,Roy,2008-07-30 21:10:00,13728,I just can't wait for that report from Limerick Lake. I've never been there.
234503,snag,2008-07-30 21:20:00,1932,"I'm an open book.  However, there seems to be residual Vaseline on my camera lens from the previous evenings drudgery that makes it appear that I'm hiding something.    I want you to know where I fish,  I just don't want you there.    (Not you Jiggsy, I always like your posts!)   I'll try to be more open in the future!"
234505,ccmtcanada,2008-07-30 21:26:00,7971,"When I read this board, I'm not necessarily looking for information.  I really enjoy seeing other people succeed, whether they are new to fishing or not.  I enjoy hearing the funny stories that come out of fishing trips....I feel I get to know people a little through them.  Why do I post?  I post to share my experiences....and I suppose to brag a little when I happen to get a big fish.  Until this past spring, almost all of my reports were from shore.  Do I publicly give out locations where I am fishing?  No I don't, but I will answer questions if they are asked in the thread.  If the answer is sensitive in nature, I'll PM the answer to them.  I've met up with fellow OFNers and taken them to my shore spots....or at least told them in detail where to go for good shore access, and what to use.  As you said, understandably, I do not give out certain honey holes.  I also do not divulge information that others have given me in confidence."
234506,blaque,2008-07-30 21:27:00,2419,"Ive read it a thousand times on here , its because ""WE LIKE PICTURES""!  Seriously though, for myself.,  i dont fish 95% of the waters that are reported on here.........im in Yankeeville USA.......so most times, im just lookin at the pics for the enjoyment of lookin at the fish. I am not scouting out water that ill never make it to anyway. Of course i read the reports that go along with anything, but if its just a visual of a guys day........well, a picture is worth a thousand words, its OK by me."
234510,Jigger,2008-07-30 21:31:00,1237,"I think the guys who think I'm panhandling for spots are severely mistaken. I don't want your spots. If I happen to find one of ""your"" spots along the way, I'll fish it and that will be that. Think of it like Real Fishing vs In-Fisherman. Bobby likes to catch his fish and have a great laugh, but its mostly entertainment with little relevant info. IN-Fisherman aims to inform. Thats the difference. I find alot of posts entertaining, but few are truly informative.  Yeah, I've asked specific questions to posts and have been answered in some, not in others. I don't take it too seriously. I fish for fun and to connect. I've also had tons of help through the PM route and have given out my fair share as well. Its a great tool.  Again, if you think I want your spots, you're quite mistaken. I won't tell you where my spots are either, but I will tell you how they're constructed and how I fished them on a given day.  Take it however you want, just make sure you're answering the post, not something you've read into it."
234515,ehg,2008-07-30 22:02:00,2666,"Jigger, i think this board has so increased in post volume the last couple of years that it is harder for a post to stick around for good comments.  But to answer your question ""Why post?"", i'll post just because i have a digi camera and it's an easy way to share my fishing story if anyone cares. I'll try to share lures, depths, methods if i can remember. Kinda like In-Fishermen or Fish n' Canada back did before internet. Not worried about lurkers, as well i've done posts showing backgrounds, methods, lures etc... went back to these places and found no one there, i was almost peeved no one took advantage of advice. Anyways keep posting, if you please, but don't expect much;  however some will be thankful of your goodwill in sharing. ehg"
234517,Greencoachdog,2008-07-30 22:10:00,8163,"I got a little ahead of myself on my first post to this thread.  I think the main reason folks post fish/report pics on this board is ""the proud angler showing off their catch""!... and I don't know about y'all, but I enjoy reading/seeing them! I don't think any of us get out as much as we would like to (if you have the time, you usually don't have the money... and if you have the money, you don't have the time  )... it's kinda like taking a trip and never leaving the farm.  If you look at the number of members this board has and then look at the number of people that post reports regularly... the percentage is pretty low.  It takes a certain amount of time and effort to post a report on this board. Time that some folks don't have, and an effort that some folks aren't willing to make.... which brings me to another point. If you should happen to read a report that entertains you... hit the reply button and give them a little compliment, it wont take you near as long to compliment them as it did for them to make the report."
234521,misfish,2008-07-30 22:16:00,29133,"I think in my reports I give enough. Not sure what more anyone wants from a report. I give baits used and how(hell even show the baits in thier yaps most of the time), and the type of structure. Sure there is probly more info I could give,but I learned from learning and watching the area around me. I think a report on the water is plenty good enough as far as I am concern. Yes I fish with probly the same two, three people from this board,but Im comfortable with that. Like I have said before,I SHARE THE GOOD STUFF VIA PM. If I were to see a report about something I passed on,that would be the end of that. Someone said it,s the WWW. That is your answer from me.  Enjoy what the site offers,or not."
234522,danbo,2008-07-30 22:17:00,2646,"I showed a co-worker a nice pickeral spot on Stoney Lake. He went to that spot every weekend for the rest of the season, with his friends! The only reason he's still alive is I'm a law-abiding guy now."

I check in 20 times a day ... because I am LOOKING FOR (hoping for) fishing porn ... so dont stop ....I post when I have something of value to add ... to give something back ... the rest is really more about sharing some comradery amongst likeminded folk who give a hoot about the same things I do ... dont crticize it ... enjoy it ...

234476,Raf,2008-07-30 20:25:00,3495,"Jigger, I am guilty of doing what you describe on this site.  My thoughts are there are far too many lurkers and people expecting a handout here.  For better or worse, the powers that be decided this to be 'much more than a fishing site' which has worked to bring in volume.   There are other places where I may go into more detail.   Walmart vs JBs.  I do post fish porn here, cause as a fisherman, I love fish porn and  I know there are people here who like to stare at fish porn.  However, I choose not to divulge info in any reports.  As you found out,  I'll probably share it in PM."
234477,Terry,2008-07-30 20:25:00,14456,people put whatever they want into their posts  and that is fine by me  and the internet is not the place to reveal all  and as I have found too much info can hurt a lake  let people reveal what they want and if you want more ask them....

I guess I could be less aloof in regards to specific details, but I don't wanna.  There's just too much at stake.  PMs are definately the way to go.  I've never steered someone wrong this way.  I love fish porn too.  The dirtier the better!!  I've become so desencitized that nothing excites me, exept for good ol fish porn.  cheers HD"
234486,Greencoachdog,2008-07-30 20:47:00,8163,"First of all Jigger, there's the reply button at the bottom of the thread. If you would like to know some particulars, just ask!... but it would probably be better to PM, as most folks that take the time to post here don't want to give away particulars to the lurkers (people that only take and never give anything back to the board)  I've found that members that post regularly are usually more than willing to help out other regular posting members... and it doesn't stop there. There's a lot of help for the Newbies too... but don't just take and not give anything back, the helping hand will be a waining one under those circumstances."

234489,lookinforwalleye,2008-07-30 20:51:00,4399," Whats the point!!! You mean like the silly reply above. LOL   I tend to agree with some of your points trying to get some of the people here to share useful information about a lake,techniques or specific baits is akin to pulling teeth the exception would be if you belong to the old boys network you will probably do okay. Sharing info on batteries,fishfinders,trailers,boats, what kind of trucks and motors you like or dislike etc. is no problem as they do not actually involve a fish or a body of water.  I asked a question recently on a specific lake (and I was not asking for GPS locations) that I was planning on fishing with my son for the first time and I recieved 1 response that was helpful and a handful of the usual responses from guys who think they are funny.  My advice if your looking for useful information buy a map book or a chart or visit the local bait shop or marina and spend a couple of bucks you will probably get all the info you need."
