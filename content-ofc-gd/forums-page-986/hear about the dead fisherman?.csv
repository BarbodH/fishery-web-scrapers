The only thing unusual was a  piece of fishing line in his eye.   The doctors and family were baffled until they xrayed his head and saw the 3 oz sinker attached to the line.  It entered at corner of eye socket so the eye wasn't obviously damaged, went through brain, and hit the back of his skull."

Here's a link to the news story.  http://www.nypost.com/seven/07312008/news/...rror_122360.htm   FISHING-LURE HORROR By TODD VENEZIA and GINGER ADAMS OTIS  A Long Island fisherman has died after a freak accident in which a weighted lure hit him in the eye and lodged in his brain.  Jaime Chicas, 21, was angling on some rocks at Jones Beach at about 8 p.m. Friday when his line snapped back and a 3-ounce sinker recoiled violently, penetrating his eye socket and hitting his brain.  Chicas' brother-in-law Jose Gonzalez, was about 30 feet away when he heard Chicas groaning.  ""We were just sitting there. It was pretty tranquil, kind of getting dark,"" Gonzalez told The Post. ""We didn't see anything, but then my cousin and I both heard him groaning. We ran to him and he was down, lying on the rocks.""  ""There was so much blood. We could see something had gone in his eye.""  Chicas was pronounced brain dead Tuesday at Nassau University Medical Center.  He leaves behind a baby and a 19-year-old wife in El Salvador. He had come to the United States illegally about a year ago and was looking for work in Long Island."
