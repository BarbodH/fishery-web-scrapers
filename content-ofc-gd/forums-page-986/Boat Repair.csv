235171,yellowboat,2008-08-01 13:10:00,211,"As Zamboni stated you can fix the boat from the outside using ""Blind Rivets"" (similar to Pop rivets but the stem gets locked in the rivet with a mechanical lock, these are structural fasterers) and can be installed with a regular Pop rivet gun(may cause damage to the gun with prolong use but is ok for a few) I would also suggest installing them with a high quality non silicone sealent.  They run about a $1 a peice.  If you decide to buy the boat and want to go this route PM me and I can give you a contact for these fasteners."
235177,Greencoachdog,2008-08-01 13:33:00,8163,"I mainly agree with some of the replies here but common sense tells me:  1. Blind rivets are ok for repairing a limited number of rivets... but they're not as strong as the original rivets.  2. Resetting a rivet will work for a while... but that rivet has already been weakened and should really be replaced.  3. Checking the floatation foam for waterlogging is a good idea but will require disassembly, or partial disassembly of the boats interior. If the boat hasn't been ""slipped"" (docked on the water) for a season while it was leaking... the foam should be ok."
235179,yellowboat,2008-08-01 13:45:00,211,"Greencoachdog I will have to disagree with you for the strength of a Blind Rivet, the rivets I suggested are stronger than solid rivet as they have a steal shank inside that is mechanically locked that provides a shear strength of 1030 lbs and a tensile strenght of 445 lbs."
235191,Zamboni,2008-08-01 14:14:00,235," Bad cases will show on way boat sits in water, and how it handles. Remove the outboard, or account for all weight and use scales at truck shop if your suspicous. Too many boats sit on trailer without angle to stern or plugs out and foam becomes saturated.  I have a long term project, a Boston Whaler 19' that had over 600 lbs of water in the foam....bought as salvage hull. Some people buy boats in worse condition thinking they're usable.  My experience with boat sellers, disclosure and claims of how honest the vendor is make me suspicious....start with foam, and do a comp and leak down test on that motor. Hope I don't come off as too negative/untrusting but I've been amazed at how people will misrepresnt items for sale."
235199,Greencoachdog,2008-08-01 14:38:00,8163," I understand your thinking YB... and I would guess you're talking about a 316 grade stainless steel shank (marine grade), but it is a ""mechanical fastener"" by which I mean the fastener has a moving part in itself and could be the source for to points of entry for water instead of one. I know there are marine grade blind rivets and they're probably very good products and would work well in a limited number!  ... but I personally would rather have a solid rivet... but hey!... that's just me!!!    Zamboni... you make a very good point!  ... and partial disassembly isn't that bad if you're mechanically inclined, the removal of the rear deck is pretty simple and is where I would start checking for waterlogging... but I like your idea of weighing as well!"
235216,yellowboat,2008-08-01 14:56:00,211,"Actually I'm not talking 316 SS, the rivet I'm suggesting is a Monel shank (Aircraft Grade).  And for it leaking that is why I had suggested wet installing with a non silicone sealent.  If you intrested http://www.cherryaerospace.com/files/pdf/catalog/CA-1011.pdf"
235256,nautifish,2008-08-01 16:14:00,1416,Thanx so much for all the Info Guy's greatly appreciated.  Took a look at the boat last night. The hull looks to need to much work. Sinns reckons the boat has hit something at one time but cant be sure. This guy brought it from someone else had not had it long when he got it in the water found water coming in. Says he does not have the time to repair it which is why he is selling. I just got a bad gut feeling and i allways allways go with my gut feeling.  So we passed on this one.  But thanx so much again Guys.   Your Great.  Nauti.
