235448,mikeh,2008-08-02 01:55:00,824,one of the most horrific crimes in this country. too bad they didn't shoot him .
235457,Burtess,2008-08-02 02:42:00,901," This is exactly what went through my mind.  What is the deal with a 4 hour stand-off?  They knew he killed someone, why not storm the bus and either take him into custody or be done with him.  I think in the US this may have turned out differently...  Burt"
235462,keram,2008-08-02 03:12:00,585,"  By no means I'm an expert on this, but the first thing which occupied my mind is that these officers are just normal, like you and me. Regardless of the reason, thay did not want to kill another ""human beeing""  ( he was no danger anymore), and live with it for the rest of their lives. Saying that I wish they did, but I can understand why they did not kill him"
235467,Greencoachdog,2008-08-02 03:35:00,8163,"Certainly a horrific crime!... but not really that unusual in the world we live in today.  If the people that commited these crimes had to suffer the same agony as their victims, you can bet there would be considerably fewer of them!  I read about this on the News and would've really rather it hadn't showed up in my ""Happy Place""... but I understand why it did."
235468,Spiel,2008-08-02 03:37:00,9065,....Can't imagine there's much left to say that hasn't been said.
235235,Cookslav,2008-08-01 15:30:00,1457," I agree... I just wish the Government would open their bloody eyes and ears and change the System. People with severe mental illness be it Violent, delusional, or self destructive ""NEED"" to be ""institutionalized"", and need constant supervision until they can be cured....if they can be cured, and the only way to determine that safely is to have them supervised in an institution The Family and friends need to have more of a say when it comes to getting loved ones help plain and simple.  Mentally ill people don't know they are ill... if their family and friends are telling the police and doctors this, there needs to be more then a 72 hour evaluation put in place, its not near enough! Its entirely possible that This tragedy could have been avoided had there been a better system in place..."
235249,fishing,2008-08-01 16:06:00,167,"Very sorry to hear this news! Cops did a good job. Not sure if it's related to any illness?  A Report on Mental Illnesses in Canada Mental illnesses touch the lives of all Canadians, exerting a major effect on relationships, education, productivity and overall quality of life. Approximately 20% of individuals will experience a mental illness during their lifetime, and the remaining 80% will be affected by an illness in family members, friends or colleagues. ...... http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/miic-m...f/men_ill_e.pdf  Mental Disorders in America Mental disorders are common in the United States and internationally. An estimated 26.2 percent of Americans ages 18 and older — about one in four adults — suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year.(1) When applied to the 2004 U.S. Census residential population estimate for ages 18 and older, this figure translates to 57.7 million people.(2) Even though mental disorders are widespread in the population, the main burden of illness is concentrated in a much smaller proportion — about 6 percent, or 1 in 17 — who suffer from a serious mental illness.(1) In addition, mental disorders are the leading cause of disability in the U.S. and Canada for ages 15-44.(3) Many people suffer from more than one mental disorder at a given time. Nearly half (45 percent) of those with any mental disorder meet criteria for 2 or more disorders, with severity strongly related to comorbidity.(1) http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publication...n-america.shtml"
235318,Rich,2008-08-01 18:39:00,3927,"That is a sick crime, completely baffling. Apparently the guy has no criminal record, no history of mental illness. A seemingly random, incredibly violent crime. Makes me feel sad for humanity in general."
235328,danbo,2008-08-01 19:31:00,2646,I guess y'all never been on a long bus-ride?  It's hell.
