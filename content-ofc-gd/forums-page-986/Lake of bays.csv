235220,Sike-1,2008-08-01 15:07:00,3,AWESOME! Thanks for the reply Mark. Advice on a lake from a fisherman of your stature is as good as i could have ever hoped.  I planned on fishing the jerkbaits anyway ( i never start a day without one tied on anyways  )... so this is good to hear.  Is there a good topo map of the lake available anywhere?   thanks

235225,Sike-1,2008-08-01 15:13:00,3,"  Is it accurate? I had a small map of LOB i got from the MNR, but it was WAAAAAY off.  Thanks"
235227,yellowboat,2008-08-01 15:19:00,211,I'm not sure how accurate it is.  I don't know the lake well.
