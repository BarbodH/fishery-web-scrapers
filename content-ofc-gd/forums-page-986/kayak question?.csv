232083,johnl,2008-07-24 03:57:00,197,do you need to wear a life jacket in a kayak or a canoe?
232084,Pigeontroller,2008-07-24 03:59:00,2793,"Just like a powerboat, you have to have one on board. But in a Kayak or Canoe your chances of ending up in the water are much,much higher! So wearing it is wise!"
232085,Rich,2008-07-24 03:59:00,3927,"Legally, no. It needs to be on board, that's it.  Common sense would state, yes - wear one. Both are very easy to tip."
232086,johnl,2008-07-24 04:04:00,197,thanks for the answer
232121,Zamboni,2008-07-24 11:22:00,235,"Your going to need a few more items than life jacket to be compliant-get one of those kits with whistle, rope-bailing bucket at CT and put it in the kayak."
232169,danbo,2008-07-24 13:32:00,2646,Next time your on the water..tip it over & try to put your jacket on after your up to your neck in it!
