Things looked pretty bleak until I found.....SHORTWAVE MARINE AT 110 LAKESHORE ROAD E. PORT CREDIT, ONTARIO. Tel. 905-278-0972. They repaired my rigger for a reasonable price and shipped back to me. Rigger is working fine....no problems.  Gaye Smith Lake Temagami, Ont."
1033286,smitty55,2018-08-30 01:02:00,928,Good stuff. That company has been around for a long time. Back in the 90's they serviced my Lowrance 1510B paper graph and did a great job. New transducer and tuned to it. Never would have figured they did riggers too.  Cheers
