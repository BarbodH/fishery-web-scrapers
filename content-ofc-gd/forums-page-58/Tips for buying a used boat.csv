1034018,JoePa,2018-09-14 19:03:00,179,The one thing about an old boat is if it is pretty old and made before 4 stroke engines were common the plate on the boat lists  the maximum HP that can be used but this figure was based on a lighter 2 stroke engine - I am not sure if the weight of the engine dictates the maximum motor size or is it strictly the HP of the motor that limits the motor size for the boat - so if you put a 4 stroke on the boat do you need to lower the HP of the motor because of the heavier weight -
1034022,grimsbylander,2018-09-14 19:46:00,3016,You have to you at the specs and compare the actual difference. Outboard engineers have really closed the gap on the weight differential. A Mercury 250hp ProXs 2 stroke is 505lbs. The new 250hp 4 stroke 4.6L V8 is 527lbs. A transom designed to handle the torque load of a 250hp shouldn't be jeopardized by <50lbs.
