1033499,OhioFisherman,2018-09-04 12:32:00,6623,Hope that works out! They might need more than 3000 though?
1033518,Mike Pike,2018-09-04 17:26:00,1332,"That's really exciting news Ohio.  I love when efforts are made to repopulate our waters with native species, especially ancient ones like sturgeon. I've never ever seen a sturgeon in the wild in my life!"
1033542,OhioFisherman,2018-09-05 02:01:00,6623,"Mike, I have never seen one in the wild myself. There has been a few news reports over the years here of an occasional catch, but very few and very far between. I watched a video earlier this year of Mark Zona and Jordan Lee fishing Lake St. Clair, Jordan hooked one the estimated to be around 100 pounds, he played it for a long time but lost it. "
1033544,OhioFisherman,2018-09-05 02:10:00,6623,"Mike, I also watched a few videos of people diving ship wrecks on Lake Erie, burbot are still around!"
1033546,Mike Pike,2018-09-05 13:11:00,1332,"That's unbelievable about Burbot in Erie.  I know a few people catch 'em icefishing on Lake Simcoe up here, but I've never heard of one being caught in Erie.  You certainly don't think of Erie for Burbot, anyway. Man, I gotta get out more!"
1033578,Gil Levesque,2018-09-06 23:40:00,103,Icaught a ling(burbot) in the upper niagara near the peace bridge several years ago! Surprised the hell outta me!! The upper niagara has it all!!!
1033579,Canuck,2018-09-06 23:58:00,491,Wonder if sturgeon eat gobies too?
1033581,OhioFisherman,2018-09-07 03:16:00,6623,"Canuck, just guessing with a sturgeon's mouth being on the bottom of their face that bottom dwelling fish like gobies would be a prime meal for them? Aren't sturgeon typically bottom dwellers? Gil, when I was very young I remember my dad talking about ice fishing for burbot "" lawyers "" at a place about 50 miles east of Cleveland, I don't know of anyone that has caught them recently. I was surprised to see them in the diving videos, most people I know don't bottom fish in those kind of depths though."
