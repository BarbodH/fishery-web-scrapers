1033098,Marty,2018-08-26 17:27:00,873,"I'm a little late in posting the report but the fishing was on fire a few weeks ago on Nip and the Upper French during our annual trip to Sandy Haven Camp.   Can't count the number of walleyes.  We had multiple 60+ days.   The bass fishing was fantastic and even though we didn't target muskies much, we had two follows and caught a number of decent pike.   Can't wait till next year! "
1033100,porkpie,2018-08-26 17:55:00,2521,Nice pics!  It sure was another ridiculously good season on Nip.
1033101,misfish,2018-08-26 17:58:00,29133,When do the Bills draft yer boy as a defensive tackle?  Nice fish and nice to hear from you Marty.
1033102,OhioFisherman,2018-08-26 18:05:00,6623,"Great pics and report, those walleyes have some awful white bellies?"
1033107,Joeytier,2018-08-26 20:32:00,3990,"Great fishing.  Nip rocks, but you seem to have figured that out already."
1033112,aplumma,2018-08-26 22:09:00,6896,Looks like a good Trip up North Marty with the whole family.  Art
1033119,wantabigone,2018-08-27 01:34:00,97,fantastic 
1033133,Hank Jr,2018-08-27 15:38:00,146,Nice fish and great report looks like everyone had a good time
1033134,John,2018-08-27 15:52:00,2956,Great pics and awesome report Marty. Miss you guys!
1033174,TJQ,2018-08-28 01:30:00,7806,"Looks like you had a blast, glad to see Ed doing well!!"
1033182,Freshtrax,2018-08-28 04:35:00,2215,Nice. Been meaning to get out there all summer I only seem to ever fish it in the winter
1033183,grimsbylander,2018-08-28 12:11:00,3016,"I love fish pics, but this has to be my favorite picture of the lot. Congrats on a great vacation."
1033190,Marty,2018-08-28 14:48:00,873,"Thanks for that comment.  It has even more meaning when you know that my mother (the wife of the guy on the left and the grandmother of the kid on the right) unexpectedly passed away two weeks before that photo was taken.  My dad wasn't going to go on this trip because he didn't want my mother to be alone that week but after she passed, he agreed that she would want him to go.  That trip was about much more than the fish caught."
1033191,lew,2018-08-28 14:58:00,12766,"Sorry to hear about your Mom Marty, that's always tough but good to know your Dad enjoyed the trip along with you guys."
1033193,grimsbylander,2018-08-28 15:29:00,3016,"I'm very sorry to hear about your loss. Yes, there was just something about that picture that made me think that years from now when the fish are long forgotten, that picture will still make you smile. Frame it...it's a keeper."
1033213,JimCC,2018-08-28 23:55:00,7,"Very sorry about the sudden loss of your Mom, Marty;   it must have been very tough on your Dad to make the trip,  but out on the water,  with you and your son, catching all those awesome Walleye and Bass,  must certainly have been therapeutic for him and all of you,  in some way. Thanks for sharing your experience here ... and the pics were Great !"
1033288,nkuchmak,2018-08-30 02:32:00,25,Wow great photos and a great family trip! Thanks for sharing.
