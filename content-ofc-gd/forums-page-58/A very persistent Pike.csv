1033327,FishFishing,2018-08-30 18:37:00,31,"I wish but no, just a little obsessed with the show"
1033328,grimsbylander,2018-08-30 19:02:00,3016,"Post away! With the exception of politics, whatever floats your boat! Oh, and guns...and cormorants...and strangely enough, small containers of premixed gas sold at exorbitant ant prices! LOL"
1033331,Terry,2018-08-30 19:38:00,14456,"Cool , i was just curious"
1033673,Rizzo,2018-09-09 21:21:00,4754,Have seen fish choke on other fish...but never seen that. I have caught muskies though that bit onto a fish on my line and refused to let go. Into the net you go! Not even a hook in their mouth...makes for easy release.
1033675,chris.brock,2018-09-09 22:29:00,4053,"I've seen stuff like that a few times. I saw a 6 pound pike choked dead with a 3 pound walleye jammed in it's mouth on the Albany River. 2 weeks ago on Ogoki Lake, we saw a fish's tail sticking out of the water waving in the air. We boated over to check it out. A small pike had a just slightly smaller pike by the head and wouldn't let go. My brother landed a 22 pound pike that attacked the walleye on his line and wouldn't let go for the 5 minute fight. The pike was never actually hooked. A couple weeks ago we shot a video of a 5 pound pike chomping a 1.5 pound walleye on the line. The funny thing was the pike kept chomping up and down like Pac Man."
