1033729,Big Cliff,2018-09-10 17:22:00,6899,"Hey guys, Thanks for checking up on me! Been trying to keep myself busy; rented a small apartment up in Noelville for a couple of months  and spent a lot of time with the kids. That, spending time with my brother, and life in general has kept me pretty well occupied for the last several months. ?"
1033731,bigugli,2018-09-10 18:23:00,6138,Good to hear you are doing well.
1033736,woodenboater,2018-09-10 19:59:00,2277,quite a few members I who seem to have gone dark. Mike from Cornwall who posted a lot about muskies is one.
1033738,captpierre,2018-09-10 20:19:00,2521,Posting from my phone is sometimes rediculously slow.  I’ve  often stopped writing a post  after a few words. This post is only somewhat  slow. Wondering if that’s the reason people have stopped. Good to hear from you Cliff
1033762,Old Ironmaker,2018-09-11 00:14:00,8243,"People  come and people go. Manitou called me last month, I was wondering where he went too. He's OK."
1033764,Hack_Fisherman,2018-09-11 00:20:00,720,This site is horrible to post on often. Hope they fix it
1033790,Loonietoon,2018-09-11 14:39:00,1450,Happy to hear all is well my friend ?
1033793,Old Ironmaker,2018-09-11 15:23:00,8243,Posting here was painful. It is much better since I loaded Google Chrome but still not great. Type text and nothing happens then it all shows up eventually and then locks up like right now. It's the only site that this happens to me.
1034074,bigbuck,2018-09-16 12:08:00,2449,Good to hear he's OK.
