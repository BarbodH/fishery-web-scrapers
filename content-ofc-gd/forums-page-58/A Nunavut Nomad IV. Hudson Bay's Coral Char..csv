1032275,Moosebunk,2018-08-06 15:36:00,3970,"During July while contracted to work in Coral Harbour, Nunavut, I was treated to six days out on the tundra fishing arctic char.  With rather tempered expectations but high hopes, an unforgettable experience would quite exceed anything I could have imagined ahead of time. This is a heavy picture loaded story inspired from places atop Hudson Bay few will ever visit, written for the spirit of fishing adventure.  Read on if you like... http://bunksoutdoorangle.com/a-nunavut-nomad-iv-hudson-bays-coral-char/   Thanks for reading, Bunk.

1032301,Freshtrax,2018-08-07 02:29:00,2215,Crazy read.   Awesome as usual 
1032305,Chuck Enwinde,2018-08-07 05:21:00,247,"Wicked and wild.  Is that the same Brody that used to take awesome pictures, and still does?"
1032351,Moosebunk,2018-08-08 02:57:00,3970,"Might just be the same fella Chuck..? Brody hasn't been at it long but the CBC Nunavut Facebook page has surely posted a good number of his arctic photos. Would guess that happy kids, huskies and any other animals he can photograph as his favorites but, he certainly did an amazing job on the fish and rainbow shots in this post. Thanks to those few who read and enjoyed."

1033403,Moosebunk,2018-09-02 16:05:00,3970,"10 years ago I fished char for the first time too. Since then, been back four more times and now basically plan each summer for it.  They are a fish that both ruins your life and makes ya incredibly happy. lol. Thanks Bill. Plenty practice. The next one will be even better, that's always the goal anyways."
