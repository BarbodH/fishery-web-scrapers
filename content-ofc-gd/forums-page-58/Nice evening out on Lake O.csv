1033603,BillM,2018-09-07 16:23:00,17367,"Decided to head out on Lake O yesterday evening to see if we could get a few staggers to go.    The winds finally changed to the north so I was hoping the warm water would finally be pushed off the shore line.  Plan was to go out for a few hours before dark and mess around with the riggers and dipsys then come in close once it got dark and cast.    Started in 50FOW with a blank screen, wasted 10 mins doing that until we pulled up and headed a bit deeper.   80ft seemed to be the ticket as I was marking fish hugging bottom.  Figuring they were lakers I decided what the hell lets at least move some rods.   Ran SD + flies + Nasty boys on the dipsys and a JPlug and a Nasty boy off the riggers.   Figured out real soon these weren't lakers but chinooks.  80ft down over 85-100ft was the ticket.   Tally for the night was 8 chinook and one beauty Coho.  Most of the action came off the deep stuff, but we did get the coho on the SD+fly and another chinny off the dipsys once it started to get dark.   Once it got dark I pulled up and got ready for casting.   Water was way to warm, wasted 2hrs casting and packed it in.   Need a few days of strong N winds to get rid of that warm water then it should be on.    Kept a shaker for a friend, the rest are back swimming.     I let her do all the reeling, she complained about sore arms     "

1033605,BillM,2018-09-07 17:29:00,17367,"I didn't wanna overwhelm her too much, lol!"
1033608,OhioFisherman,2018-09-07 17:43:00,6623,"Lucky you got out before the weekend? The forecast here doesn't look good for late Saturday thru Monday, 40 mile an hour winds and up to 7 inches of rain."
1033610,BillM,2018-09-07 17:50:00,17367,"Weekend isn't too bad up here, looks like Monday isn't going to be very nice though."
1033632,spincast,2018-09-07 23:35:00,3279,"nice going. Its been one of those years on our side  - where you gotta go with your gut to connect, great way to spend an evening "
1033637,LostAnotherOne,2018-09-08 01:38:00,956,Be careful Bill. Shes gonna end up beating all your PB.
1033645,BillM,2018-09-08 14:58:00,17367,"Yeah it was nice to pattern them out fairly quickly.   Funny thing is there was a spot that just produced fish after fish, every time I circled back and trolled through a rod went off.   I should have vertical jigged them just for the fun of it, lol."
1033672,chris.brock,2018-09-09 19:21:00,4053,"Nicely done! That's exciting fishing, I'm sure your better half had a blast. It looks like some rain is coming and some of those fish might be on the move."
1033674,BillM,2018-09-09 21:29:00,17367,"Yeah I hope so, I'd like her to get a few while casting at night.  That's a riot."
