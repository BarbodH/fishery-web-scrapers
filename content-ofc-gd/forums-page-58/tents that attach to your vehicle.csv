1032698,kickingfrog,2018-08-16 02:50:00,8333,How much space would be between the wheel wells in a pick-up?
1032700,riddickulous,2018-08-16 04:04:00,27,"I have a napier suv 82000 tent. I enjoy it for car-camping for versatility. It is meant for use with SUV, it's not one that uses a pick-up truck bed. It can function as a stand-alone tent. Then it has a sleeve that can wrap around an open SUV hatch. It can be tightened to keep the bugs out, even has a screen door if there are bugs. Pros: - you can sleep in the car, or sleep in the tent; the tent feels so much roomier with the suv attached; the tent can function as a stand-alone tent by zipping up the sleeve and driving away; its much easier to grab stuff from the car when you don't need to go outside; if a bear comes you can jump in the car; its a nice tent even without the connection - i've slept 4 comfortably, and i can stand up easily inside. Cons: - you cannot leave the car running; you have to let the exhaust cool before putting the sleeve on; there is chance bugs can wiggle through the sleeve or come in from the suv; it can be difficult to park the car in the exact location if you want to reconnect the car after leaving; takes a little longer to set up; quite a large and heavy tent"
1032701,ckewley,2018-08-16 11:27:00,699,"Pretty much sums it up! I used it mainly to get dressed as I could stand up & to unload all the crap out of the car for day trips. My bed was in the back of my Rav4 so I left the rear door open all night for air flow, no issues with bugs or rain! It would run down my roof under the sleeve then channel around the door, the bottom of the sleeve has drain holes, no issues. Re-attaching the car wasn't a problem after the first few failed attempts, you figure it out pretty quickly. Now would I buy one? short answer is yes,  because of the lady friend, on my own I'd say no. That one for the back of the pick up looks bitchn though"
1032754,GBW,2018-08-17 17:11:00,8460,"Depends on the truck, full size vs mid size.  I know you can sleep 2 adults in a mid size as I've done it.  The tent I posted is $400 or $450?  That price range at least pre tax..."
1032763,kickingfrog,2018-08-17 20:21:00,8333,Comical to think of these 2 adults sleeping in the back of a truckbed. 
1032764,woodenboater,2018-08-17 20:31:00,2277,I've always jonesed for something like these. Basspro used to sell something similar but there's nothing on their site now. Not great if you plan to move often so pretty well basecamp I think. http://dingodoza.com.au
1032767,kickingfrog,2018-08-17 21:19:00,8333,I think Nissan had something similar a few years ago but the price I saw was thousands of dollars and I can't see any reason to pay a premium to be off the ground. 
1033055,Freshtrax,2018-08-25 14:13:00,2215,Buy a really good tent if you plan on using it more than once a summer.  I have a eureka timberline a frame could camp in a hurricane and not get wet. Should last another 15-20 years
1033236,bpsbassman,2018-08-29 13:37:00,941,"I call this the RogMahal!!? Used it several times and it has worked awesome, even in torrential downpour Sleep in the van, high and dry.  Use the main tent for dressing, guests and my coffee maker and fan?  Use the side entrance to keep other stuff dry.   Love it!  Paid for itself after the  first trip!  The van disattaches in seconds if you need to go somewhere and the tent can be used standalone.       "
1032602,kickingfrog,2018-08-14 03:20:00,8333,We're getting a new vehicle and you can get a tent that attaches to the hatch at the back. My first thought is that a good tent is better than anything that attaches to the back but thought I'd see what the gang here has experienced. How is the seal around the hatch? I'd think it would be a possible mosquito issue?
1032603,OhioFisherman,2018-08-14 03:55:00,6623,"I have never used one kick, not much of a tenter in my past, but this place has some examples of them for suvs and pickups. https://www.jcwhitney.com/results/?N=0&amp;Nr=wpn_cat_name:Outdoor+%26+Camping+Gear"
1032604,dave524,2018-08-14 09:04:00,4508,"Makes no sense to me, it ties the vehicle up ,  a separate tent frees up the vehicle and is probably roomier."
1032609,SylvanOwner,2018-08-14 16:21:00,266,I'm with Dave on this.  Thought the idea looked cool when I first saw it a few years ago but when you think about it in practical terms....makes no sense imho
1032612,grimsbylander,2018-08-14 18:59:00,3016,"From what I've seen, most people that use those tents still have a separate tent for storage, changing, etc. and just use the vehicle tent for sleeping. Personally, I have had a few uncomfortable and damp nights in a tent and like the idea of being up off the ground if it's raining. I'm older now too and getting spoiled! lol I'd consider getting an additional, cheaper utility tent and investigating decent vehicle tent as well. Asking about the setup effort is important just in case you need the vehicle during the day though to me, 10 minutes of setup is worth not sleeping on the ground."
1032614,Chuck Enwinde,2018-08-14 19:26:00,247,I know @CKewley used one for his NFLD trip earlier in the summer.  He could probably provide some insight.
1032619,Fang,2018-08-14 20:48:00,1330,"when I used to fish a lot of back lakes up north we did a couple nights in the back of a pick up using a Napier truck tent. It's very useful when backroading and flat camp ground areas are non existent. We just parked at the end of the road, launched the canoe and set the tent up on the truck bed. My buddy paid under $200 if I remember for his tent I think he bought his off Amazon. It was a bit better sleeping up off the ground especially in bear country. "
1032623,misfish,2018-08-14 21:44:00,29133,Exactly what I am looking for Paul.
1032625,GBW,2018-08-14 21:50:00,8460,This is what the pick up one's look like  
1032626,pike slayer,2018-08-14 22:10:00,1177,I bought one of those SUV tent a few years ago thinking it was a great idea. I never ended up using it. It's a dust collector. I bought a tent trailer directly after. Sold it for a before one. Then yoloed leased property bought a 26' camper and I'm building a cabin. I suggest just skip tent and camper stage and go straight to a cabin haha
1032629,huzzsaba,2018-08-14 22:56:00,884,I second that.
1032631,huzzsaba,2018-08-14 22:58:00,884, The bigger question in my opinion is what car are you looking to get?  You may be able to sleep in the car if its a bigger size suv or van.
1032634,misfish,2018-08-14 23:22:00,29133,Some of you guys miss the whole camping out thing in the 21 century.
1032636,Terry,2018-08-14 23:33:00,14456,"For me, roughing it is a hotel that ends room service at 9pm "
1032642,kickingfrog,2018-08-15 00:12:00,8333,"Ya, between a stand alone tent, sleeping in the vehicle and no-tell-motels I don't see this being something I need/want. Thanks for the feedback."
1032653,Fisherman,2018-08-15 01:43:00,7201,What kind of vehicle are you getting?  Maybe there's some more ideas.
1032657,kickingfrog,2018-08-15 03:21:00,8333,Nissan pathfinder.
1032664,dave524,2018-08-15 11:40:00,4508,"The worst thing they did was get rid of the bench seat in the front of pickups, slept on that bench quite a few times steelheading and duck hunting and pickups had 2 doors and eight foot boxes."
1032668,grimsbylander,2018-08-15 12:14:00,3016,"Very nice. I used to drive a 4Runner and this size truck is great for running down fire roads into back lakes. Mind you, this was before 4 wheelers were popular. Slept in the back of that truck more than once....once even while fishing! lol"
1032669,porkpie,2018-08-15 12:27:00,2521,"Not me pal.  I've camped everywhere, including some really remote spots.  Unless my kids specifically ask to camp, no way I'm sleeping in a tent again lol."
1032680,pike slayer,2018-08-15 16:12:00,1177,If you sleep in the vehicle I highly recommend making some kind of screen to fit in the window cause it will get hot and stuffy and you don't want to let the skeletons in
1032681,canoehead,2018-08-15 16:41:00,2,Yep. Terrible.
1032686,canoehead,2018-08-15 20:31:00,2,
1032687,kickingfrog,2018-08-15 20:38:00,8333,About the only time I sleep in my vehicle now is hunting so heat isn't usually a problem. I find sleeping in the front with the seats reclined is as comfortable as in the back of the SUV with the seats flat.
1032696,HTHM,2018-08-16 01:34:00,4082,I have on of these and find that it is a great option to have available.
