1032857,floater,2018-08-21 15:02:00,220,Heading to the Gaspe area for a two week drive. I'm wondering if anyone has gone that way and fished for Mackeral? We will be staying at Gaspesie and Forillon National parks and driving all around the coastal areas. I don't want to buy the Atlantic Fishing licence so we won't be fishing any inland waters.

A bit of a drive to get there though, bugs were next to nill. Looking to do something besides fish, Mont Lyall agate mine was pretty awesome, just south of the park."

1033231,zippyfx,2018-08-29 13:09:00,5,Last time I was there was years ago but you should talk to the locals when the caplin are running in the nights. They should be spawning in the evening on the shores around this time.  I saw some locals bring out the big rods and cast over the caplin to catch the predators chasing them into the shallows.
