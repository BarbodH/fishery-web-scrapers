I'm terrible at articulating myself in writing but I started thinking about something my dad told me a few years back, he said ""this is not a dress rehearsal"", in other words get out there and do what makes you happy, this is it! I could have mown the lawn, cleaned the house,truck,garage etc...etc...but I figure I won't be on my death bed wishing I had done those things, so I indulged my passion and took the dog for a walk, caught some fish and made a video, guess what, the truck is still dirty and our new kitten puked in an already messy house....life goes on.  "
1033860,grimsbylander,2018-09-12 14:21:00,3016,Another great video sir and your write up on the money. I found myself watching the dog and his reaction instead of the fish! lol
1033864,Headhunter,2018-09-12 16:22:00,5703,"That's livin Simon! Thanks for posting this, it sure helped to raise my spirits! ""Just gotta get it past the Pike""... made me LOL HH "
1033889,Rattletrap2,2018-09-12 22:02:00,1652,You Sir are living a charmed life up there! Enjoy!
1033890,misfish,2018-09-12 22:45:00,29133,Thanks Simon.  Rolof seems to be settling down. LOL
1033895,spincast,2018-09-12 23:09:00,3279,"awesome - put a smile on my face, thanks for sharing.  That drone gets some seriously nice shots. your Dad's a smart guy"
1033914,limeyangler,2018-09-13 13:27:00,5204,"LOL...I just realized that Roloff now responds to the 'beep' of the goPro, he knows when it beeps that it is fish on and comes running...smart pup.   Thanks HH, without fail a pike tries to snatch a walleye at that spot, I have use of a cache boat there if I want, must get my act together and take advantage of that, would be an interesting day casting some big lures in there.   I have my struggles, but it certainly helps to have struggles here than on the TTC....lol.   Yeah, he does not even go in after the beaver there, just barks from shore.   I used the drone yesterday to scope out a new logging road which I figured must go pretty close to a lake that has AMAZING walleye fishing but is really only accessible in the winter....looks promising."
1033989,gordy28,2018-09-14 01:53:00,638,As always really enjoyed the post and the video your Dads advice and you sharing it was also great. Cheers Gordy
