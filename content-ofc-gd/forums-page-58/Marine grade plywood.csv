1033433,Hack_Fisherman,2018-09-02 22:11:00,720, Do you add grit to keep it anti slip?
1033480,JoePa,2018-09-03 22:43:00,179,No - the part that I had done earlier isn't slippery - I used a flat water based paint - I generally have sneakers on or other rubber bottom shoes when in the boat - I don't know how it would be if the floor was wet and I had other type shoes on

1033558,33825,2018-09-05 22:54:00,7,"I did my floor a couple years back and marine ply was not worth the cost. At Robert Bury lumber they have plywood made for billboards that’s made of fir at about $60 a sheet. I know a guy that worked for the highways department who said guys would use it for floors in their boats after it was used for a billboard for ten years or so and it was still plenty strong enough. Anyway, I went this route and it was much cheaper and has not disappointed in any manner. I did cover it in vinyl as well. The vinyl cost me about $200 bucks for my 18’ boat. It was money well spent for sure. Just my opinion, Good luck with the job! Keep your hooks sharp!"
1033567,JoePa,2018-09-06 13:22:00,179,If your worried about a slippery deck there is a produce that would take care of that - it is called Tuff Coat - non skid coating - it is rubberized deck coating polyurethane safety coating - it can be obtained at Wholesale Marine in the net

1032938,misfish,2018-08-22 21:43:00,29133,"If you seal the plywood PROPERLY, it will last years Mr.B. I did my own floors years back if you remember . The boat is still the same with the new owner."

1032943,Pikeslayer,2018-08-22 22:27:00,1443,"I think you'll find the smaller urban centres (i.e. Georgetown) lumber yards more accommodating in bringing in special orders such as MG plywood? I helped a lake neighbour source MG in Parry Sound earlier this year. Both Rona & Home Hardware Building Centre were more than happy to special order without surcharges. We went with HH as their delivery was only 5 days as it was added to an incoming stock order.  	I didn't call by phone, I visited both stores to inquire. It's too easy to say ""no"" over the phone Edit to add: You will still need2 part epoxy to seal cut/trimmed exposed wood & those sheets are extra heavy  "

1032957,pikeyminnow,2018-08-23 12:56:00,18,I’m not sure where you’re located but I bought some a few years back at Monaghan Lumber near Peterborough. And I know Peacock Lumber in Oshawa carries it as well although they just had a fire there in the past week or so and don’t know how much damage was done so am not sure if they’re still open. It’s not cheap but if you’re doing it once you might as well do it right in my opinion.
1032958,dave524,2018-08-23 13:41:00,4508,"Unless you are actually building a hull with plywood you are wasting money buying marine plywood for things like floor or transom replacement, the difference is in the quality of the veneers not  longevity.

1032960,grimsbylander,2018-08-23 13:44:00,3016,"Before deciding on marine plywood, I'd suggest evaluating a few other things such as the overall age of the boat and how long he wants to keep it. I had the same look on my face when my 82 year old neighbour paid a premium for 50 year shingles  lol The boat is a 1980, ok...what about everything else? Motor? The flooring should be the longest lasting item on a boat from a cost perspective. Properly sealed plywood or pressure treated(under carpet) might just outlast the rest of a 1980 boat...and save him some money. jmho Good luck!"

1033043,Hack_Fisherman,2018-08-25 01:40:00,720,.  My 1975 Starcraft has the original and now rotten ply. Which was only sheathing grade. No sealer.  Marine ply is only important when constructing new plywood boats. Sealed standard ply is all needed

1033299,Steve Piggott,2018-08-30 12:32:00,196,The weight of the wood that I removed was the same as the poly
1033317,Sinker,2018-08-30 15:55:00,8692,"Yeah, I guess when you compare waterlogged, soft plywood it would be comparable, but a full 4x8 sheet of 3/4"" poly is much heavier than plywood. Its a great way to go though, it certainly won't get heavier. I have been considering the same as a I have a good source for it.  4x8x3/4"" plywood is 70lbs 4x8x3/4 HDPE is 120lbs S."
