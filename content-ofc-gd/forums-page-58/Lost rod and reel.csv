Pflueger reel, Berkley rod, bright yellow braid, may have had a pop-r style lure on it. Went back Sunday and is wasn't there. Reward. Call or text me at 705 795 6579. Thanks."

1033685,grimsbylander,2018-09-10 01:13:00,3016,"Geezz I'll bet the little guy feels horrible. Hope someone posts it ""FOUND"" somewhere."
1033732,kickingfrog,2018-09-10 18:52:00,8333,"Ya, it was his first very own rod and reel and he feels pretty bad. The flip side is he isn't going to miss out on a fishing trip because of it and maybe he'll learn a lesson on keeping track of his stuff. All part of growing up."
