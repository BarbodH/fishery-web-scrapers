1033250,Reef Runner,2018-08-29 16:20:00,980,"Hello all: Quick question on Balsam walleyes: FM17 regs  S:4, must be between 35-50cm, Balsam exception S:3, cannot be between 37-55cm.  Therefore, if I'm reading these right, I can keep 3 cigars between 35-36cm? That's a tiny window. Sporting license of course. Let's not turn this into a guys keep 'em anyway and locals do this and that.  Just lookin' to stay legal on the long weekend.  Thanks a bunch. Reef."
1033252,cheaptackle,2018-08-29 16:33:00,849,"Not a balsam angler but the way I read what you posted is that you cannot keep anything 37-55 cm, above or below is ok.  Balsam would be an exception to the 35-50, replaced by the nothing between the 37-55.   Haven't read that section to confirm.  Anyone else got input on this?  Michael"
1033253,Terry,2018-08-29 16:37:00,14456,Yes 3 fish none between 14.6 and 21.7 inches
1033255,David Chong,2018-08-29 17:05:00,836,"Yes, Balsam is almost the reverse slot of the rest of the Kawarthas! Balsam Lake was the first lake in the Kawarthas to have a slot!"
1033256,Reef Runner,2018-08-29 17:41:00,980,"Thanks for the guidance fellas. I was reading the regs and exception in congruity...aka thinking I could only keep three between 35-36cm lol better make sure that tape measure is accurate. Over/under Balsam slot, from what I'm understanding, good to go. Thanks for clearing it up.  "
1033276,GBW,2018-08-29 21:54:00,8460,"Yes, Over and Under for Balsam"
1033298,captpierre,2018-08-30 12:29:00,2521,Pinched or not pinched tail ?
1033300,Terry,2018-08-30 12:49:00,14456,"Size Limits – All size limits refer to total length which is a measure from the tip of the mouth with the jaws closed to the tip of the tail, with the tail fin lobes compressed to give the maximum possible length."
1033318,Sinker,2018-08-30 15:59:00,8692,Its always the maximum possible length.
