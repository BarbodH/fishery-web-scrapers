1033836,buick14,2018-09-11 23:33:00,741,"This things looks like it has been left out in that parking lot and sun all day.  If I look closely, I think I see a tire mark from one of those fat bikes. not sure why everybody feels the need to do crap like this.  I saw an African cichlid in Etobicoke creek by the airport this summer, thriving.......but not for long *smh*"
1033983,pics,2018-09-14 01:08:00,1268,It's possible that they could survive the warm water outflow around the steel mills for a short time...
1034002,jimmer,2018-09-14 13:31:00,2730,"The eye looks a little too good for it to be a fish that was left laying in the parking lot. The colour is probably washed out because of the environment. I have seen a koi swimming around in Paudash Lake for the last few years. I forgot to check when I was there last weekend, it tends to stick to the same fallen tree."
1034003,Mike Pike,2018-09-14 13:38:00,1332,Just saw an article in the Hamilton Spectator last week that said there have been several catches of Tilapia in Hammy Harbour as well as a Chinese Crab and this catfish found in the aquarium trade. Not just reproduction to be concerned with but the transfer of diseases to native species.
1034012,Snidley,2018-09-14 16:40:00,620," if you go to a Chinese grocery store you will see that there are multiple colour patterns in Tillapia. This is one of those colours. The very nature of aquarium life for food fish also washes out the colour, even in the grey ones. You can see this clearly when you see the largemouth bass they sell as ""Green Bass"". The bass look like a ghost bass pattern with pale green and ghostly black markings. It bugs me to see largemouth as an aquarium food fish but there it is."
1030434,John Bacon,2018-06-29 01:56:00,3277,"Someone on Facebook claims to have caught three tilapia from Lake Ontario in the Burlington area.  I doubt that they will make it through the winter.  But if they do, we may have another species in the Lake"
1030439,captpierre,2018-06-29 12:15:00,2521,Wow. Not sure about their biology but I hope you’re right.
1030447,jimmer,2018-06-29 13:45:00,2730,They won't survive.  They go belly up down in Florida when the temps drop to around zero from what I have seen.
1030448,G.mech,2018-06-29 13:52:00,830,"According to my son who is a resident biologist on a large commercial tilapia farm, tilapia are intolerant to cold and start to die off when the water temps drop to below 55oF.   Although some could survive, it is highly unlikely they could reproduce in the temperatures found in Lake O. I suppose he should know and I can assure you that these little tidbits of relatively useless information cost me dearly so I'm going to have to go along with his answer I guess."
1030454,OhioFisherman,2018-06-29 14:42:00,6623,"LOL, I feel your pain! It cost me a lot of money for my daughter to learn how to castrate a hog! Ya the book says the cold will kill them."
1030462,dave524,2018-06-29 16:34:00,4508,Probably a WGSF ?
1030464,jimmer,2018-06-29 17:01:00,2730,They might have been crappie that were miss identified as Tilapia.
1030467,Snidley,2018-06-29 17:31:00,620,Or White Perch. The look similar to a Tilapia
1030468,John Bacon,2018-06-29 17:37:00,3277," No, there were pictures and biologist on the thread.  They were tilapia.  Probably a hybrid of a nile tilapia."
1030473,jimmer,2018-06-29 18:26:00,2730,"Actually this is terrible news. Obviously someone is trying to stock the fish in the lake, on purpose or ignorantly.  Tilapia are not your normal aquarium fish that someone wants to get rid of.  They won't survive, but the next species someone tries just might take hold."
1033690,Dubz905,2018-09-10 10:58:00,7,hey that guy who said he caught them was me. There are alot of them out there 
1033691,Dubz905,2018-09-10 11:00:00,7,
1033692,grimsbylander,2018-09-10 11:04:00,3016,Calico bass
1033693,Dubz905,2018-09-10 11:16:00,7,Ministry already took them and said otherwise
1033694,Dubz905,2018-09-10 11:17:00,7,And I have caught those down in california alittle different
1033696,grimsbylander,2018-09-10 11:21:00,3016,"If you stick around long enough, you'll see the humour is that "
1033697,Dubz905,2018-09-10 12:10:00,7,Ya but i have physically caught calico bass before and that's no where even close. The ones I got were farmed tilapia. Even had all the top fin cut off
1033699,Terry,2018-09-10 12:34:00,14456,There was humour  in his post most people here knows lately there have been posts about Calico bass and what they are  and the smiley face beside means joke was intended 
1033702,Dubz905,2018-09-10 12:44:00,7,I'm a group virgin ok. Haven't popped my cherry yet lololol
1033705,David Chong,2018-09-10 12:57:00,836,WOW ? Crazy stuff! Any word back from the Ministry?
1033712,Dubz905,2018-09-10 13:38:00,7,It's the ministry they just say they will look into it. I even volunteered to take them out and show them.
1033713,grimsbylander,2018-09-10 14:11:00,3016,Thanks Terry! Should have went with pickerel  dang.
1033714,jimmer,2018-09-10 14:25:00,2730,Oh no...... 
1033733,G.mech,2018-09-10 19:11:00,830,"I asked my son who is a biologist & currently babysitting about 600,000 tilapia on a fish farm if he thought that's what this was.  His reply:  Hopefully he's right in the fact that they won't be able to reproduce....."
1033735,grimsbylander,2018-09-10 19:49:00,3016,"Does your son happen to sleep under his desk all day?? Oops wrong episode lol Good information, thanks!"
