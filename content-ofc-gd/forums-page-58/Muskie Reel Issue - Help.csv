1033436,Marty,2018-09-02 22:24:00,873,"Bought a used Abu C4 left handed version for my son.    Although it technically used, it was only used once and the owner hated using a baitcaster and dumped it.    It's spooled with PowerPro and it looks like it was never in the water.   For some reason, it's a little difficult to crank. I took it apart to check lubrication and when I took off the right side plate, it reeled smoothly.  Looks well-lubricated.  When I put the side plate back on, it's tough to retrieve again.  If I loosen the screws again, it's easy to retrieve.  I'm confused why tightening the side plate appears to be the issue.  Any thoughts?"
1033441,OhioFisherman,2018-09-02 23:37:00,6623,I don't suppose it is possible for the spool adjustment knob to be cranked down too hard?
1033443,grimsbylander,2018-09-03 01:01:00,3016,"Funny, without seeing the reel , I was thinking the same thing. Maybe back it right off, tighten down the side plate and then try it?"
1033444,cheaptackle,2018-09-03 01:02:00,849,I did a quick giggle search for schematics for your real and got a huge amount of hits.  I did that in hopes of putting a link here to help as it almost sounds like a missing spacer maybe.  I can't determine which reel may be yours.  I searched abu garcia c4 schematics.  Maybe if you try the search you can identify the exact reel schematic and determine if you may be actually missing something.

1033446,OhioFisherman,2018-09-03 01:19:00,6623,"grim, just thinking if the previous owner was having trouble adapting to a baitcaster he might have cranked that knob down trying to prevent backlashes? When I first got sick I bought 3 of those lefties, 4- 5- 6- series from a guy on ebay, displays and never fished. I put line on a couple of them but only used one once, my hands stopped working well enough for me to use a baitcaster without tossing it overboard."
1033448,BillM,2018-09-03 03:49:00,17367,Sounds exactly like the tensioner is cranked down.
1033474,misfish,2018-09-03 21:09:00,29133,"Theres your problem.  What Bill said. Cranked to hard ,it is hard to reel."
1033486,Marty,2018-09-04 00:06:00,873,"Thanks Gents.  All good.   Don't think the tensioner was the issue because the reel casted like a charm, it was just tough to retrieve.   I pull the reel apart, reassembled it and it works like a charm.  Who knows."
1033491,OhioFisherman,2018-09-04 00:45:00,6623,Well we tried! Glad that worked out for you.
1033513,captpierre,2018-09-04 16:14:00,2521,I’d have several parts left over if i tried that ?
