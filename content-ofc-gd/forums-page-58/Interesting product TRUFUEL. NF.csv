1033511,grimsbylander,2018-09-04 15:15:00,3016,"I have a question that's kind of related...maybe. As an alternative to the whole storing gas debate, has anyone had first hand experience with the cordless lithium powered string trimmers? My neighbour has had one for about a year and loves it. Just not sure what to buy and what will handle a 90'x130' lot. Sorry if I'm highjacking your thread Brian, I just thought it may be a good alternative for condo's etc.?"
1033514,misfish,2018-09-04 16:36:00,29133,"That is why I live in a condo, trimming aint my problem. LOL"
1033527,grimsbylander,2018-09-04 18:25:00,3016,Ah...good point. Someone did mention condo's but no lawn care would be nice.
1033529,JoePa,2018-09-04 18:56:00,179,Trufuel at $9.00 a liter - holy mackeral - I can buy ethanol free 95 octane gas at $3.45 a gallon - add a half ounce of stabilizer and some 50 to 1 oil and I have the same thing at approx. $ 1.00 a liter - sounds like a ripe off - I cut about 5 cords of wood each year at that rate I'd go broke - if you use a lot of gas in you chainsaw you would be better to find some ethanol free  gas and mix it with a stabilizer and oil yourself - just saying 
1033535,misfish,2018-09-04 21:10:00,29133,Yup got that.  I dont need fuel and oils and stabilizer lying around. Get my friendly deed done with a can or two and I have nothing left behind. 18 bucks aint going to break me once a year..  CONVENIENCE.
1033541,John Bacon,2018-09-05 01:52:00,3277,Mine works fine for me.  My actual lot is only about 47' x 110'.  But I also maintain two boulevards and a greenway.
1033548,Sterling,2018-09-05 14:14:00,477,"Check out electric augers, they're awesome. Though if you can't charge the batteries you're SOL, unless you buy spares."
1033549,Terry,2018-09-05 15:02:00,14456,"I have a had time spending 7 or 800 bucks for a battery auger and 200plus for a second battery   just too cheap, i do have a dewalt/clam drill auger but on 2 or 3 ft of ice i like gas "
1033550,Sterling,2018-09-05 15:48:00,477,"I'm not sure when the price went bananas on the ion series. But I paid $400 at Crappy tire a couple years ago. Agreed that $800 is excessive, hope that's just temporary. There are some hidden benefits of battery augers; no fuel, oil, stuff on your hands, carb kits, etc."
1033577,Dutch01,2018-09-06 19:35:00,1431,"I don't really understand why everyone is struggling to understand this point. So you're cheap and want to spend less? Great, have at 'er. Why care that we find a few extra dollars for convenience works for us????"
1033059,misfish,2018-08-25 16:52:00,29133,"Thought I would share this. I was talking to a fellow worker yesterday about gas stations having a premix pump for boats and what not. I thought this would a great addition to a station. Would save having to have gas cans and oils lying around the garage.. Messy stuff. Then he tells me about this product that is premixed in a can , Trufuel. I was like . He,s been using it for awhile now for when he just need enough for his chain saw. I was thinking this is pretty cool. So today I bought a can to use in my chain saw. I only have a 16"" Stihl and it sips, also, living in a condo, I do not need a gerry can sitting around stinking up the joint. So I filled up the saw and man, this stuff fired it right up. For my needs once or twice a year, and for $9 for a liter can, it,s worth it to me. They have 50-1 and 40-1 and 4 stroke.  https://trufuel50.com/product-info/"
1033061,Dutch01,2018-08-25 17:05:00,1431,"I've been using this stuff in my gas auger for years, it's great ?"
1033063,Acountdeleted,2018-08-25 17:15:00,2562,It’s super great. We use that as well as the STHIL pre-mix. If you use it the warentee is still valid. Only thing is it’s expensive. $10 a litre. I think i’d Rather do my own mixing.
1033071,Dutch01,2018-08-25 20:48:00,1431,I doubt my auger even uses a whole can per season so $10 a liter is not really an issue for me.
1033072,John Bacon,2018-08-25 21:04:00,3277,"So the four stroke is just gasoline.  Or, by the sounds of it, gasoline with stabilizer added."
1033073,misfish,2018-08-25 21:17:00,29133,No idea John.  Im going with the 50-1 can. Maybe call W-5 on that one. LOL

1033126,grimsbylander,2018-08-27 12:18:00,3016,LOL I'm with Terry on this...I'm waaaay too cheap to spend that much on convenience. haha
1033128,Dutch01,2018-08-27 13:22:00,1431,I'm with you. I live in an apartment. A can lasts me all season and this stuff never goes bad. Its also not just premixed gas. It's better and cleaner. It won't gum up carbs. I can understand not wanting the cost if you're using liters per trip but it's perfect for me.
1033131,Terry,2018-08-27 15:09:00,14456,A quarter liter of mixed isn’t going to do anything to 80 liters in your truck but give it to a homeless person on the street if it scares you.
1033135,SirCranksalot,2018-08-27 16:23:00,3291,Yup---If lived in a condo I'd do the same! Different strokes for different folks!!

1033142,aplumma,2018-08-27 18:37:00,6896,"The safe to store in a condo makes me wonder. The product is 99% gasoline with the additives used in Sta-bil Marine 360 makes it good for 2 years of storage. The only difference on the product is it is in a metal can that is resealable which will keep it from releasing vapors into a living space. It is just as flammable as gas that comes from the gas station. The metal gas cans that are rated for gasoline will provide the same ease of storage as the metal tru fuel can does. So the next time you empty the tru fuel bottle use sta bil,quality 2 stroke oil and your favorite non ethanol or ethanol fuel with the sta bil product and you will have the same product much cheaper.

1033323,Sinker,2018-08-30 18:11:00,8692,I have way too many 2 strokes that run 50:1 to pay $10/litre. I keep a 20l jerry can mixed all the time.  Boat has its own tank that's also 50:1.
