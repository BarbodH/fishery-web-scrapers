1033278,dave524,2018-08-29 22:47:00,4508,"The Crappie I caught in my youth, 50's and 60's,  were as I recall all White Crappie. I don't recall Black Crappie till I lived in Port Rowan 1973 to 75 and fished the Inner Bay at Long Point and they soon became my favourite table fare."
1033279,OhioFisherman,2018-08-29 23:30:00,6623,"My dad and my brother used to go to Dale Hollow lake in Kentucky/Tennessee in the 60's for spring crappie fishing, he said a lot of people there called them calico bass, I thought it was a southern thing."
1033287,206,2018-08-30 01:58:00,563,"I wish someone would say YES they are invasive... Then I wouldn't feel so bad harvesting a freezer full every spring when they come in to spawn. I feel bad seeing the eggs when I fillet the 12-14 inch ones I keep, but that's the only time I can seem to find them"
1033354,jimmer,2018-08-31 17:54:00,2730,You shouldn't feel too bad if you follow the limits in the regs.
1033366,dave524,2018-08-31 20:26:00,4508,"yes they are invasive, for most of my time on earth there was no limit on Crappie , Perch and Sunfish,  keep your limit and eat them frequently, and catch another possession limit,  DON""T feel guiltly"
1033371,GBW,2018-08-31 22:51:00,8460,Keep eating...    I still wonder how that one your daughter caught on 4ML got in there
1033520,Mike Pike,2018-09-04 17:43:00,1332,"Hey, the Harbour is clean now and everything's great."
1033525,AKRISONER,2018-09-04 18:15:00,5558,"this is all about as confusing as the whole jackfish, walleye, pickerel, chain pickerel, northern pike lingo crap that goes on lol. If you go around talking about Calico bass these days and you arent talking about anything but Kelp Bass, most people are going to think you are nuts.  Theres a whole pile of guys in California that fish Kelp/calico bass and a lot of the tactics are exactly the same as fishing large/smallmouth bass. The water they fish tends to be deeper, so guys use a lot of swimbaits/underspin/jig type gear. Check out the company warbaits and their signature warblade. "
1033526,grimsbylander,2018-09-04 18:22:00,3016,Enjoy!! I will respectively pass on eating fish from there ? lol
1033534,aplumma,2018-09-04 20:13:00,6896,White crappie and black crappie are two different species that are rarely identified correctly and reality in most cases doesn't matter. The name that covers both are Calico bass and Sac o lait (cajun). Art 
1033036,Hack_Fisherman,2018-08-24 23:13:00,720,"I had a great week fishing this past week. Nothing huge but gobs of fish. I had a local tell me “someone must have dumped crappie in there” which I hear often about perch etc. (I’m assuming crappie, like perch are spread by eggs on waterfoul legs) but my question is, are they invasive and problematic to sport fish? He told me they eat walleye eggs. After this comment, I also had to wonder if they’d had many under water predators that can eat them due to their large disk shape"
1033037,Pikeslayer,2018-08-24 23:43:00,1443,No.
1033039,OhioFisherman,2018-08-25 00:46:00,6623,"http://www.fishingsimcoe.com/conservation/invading-species It probably all depends on the body of water you are fishing in, crappie eat a lot of baitfish, and you can only assume smaller young gamefish?"
1033041,Hack_Fisherman,2018-08-25 01:00:00,720,Thanks guys. Are they native to Southern and Eastern Ontario? This was on a small lake near Perth. They were hitting like crazy  and I had a great time
1033042,OhioFisherman,2018-08-25 01:22:00,6623,"No idea of their "" native "" range up there, but they get them all over Ontario, even places like Lake of the woods."
1033045,grimsbylander,2018-08-25 03:06:00,3016,Black crappie are only considered delicious
1033050,aplumma,2018-08-25 13:18:00,6896,I have a trophy lake that I fish and largemouth bass up to 8 lbs and crappie of 13 inches are co existing. It could get out of balance but they are no more harmful than bluegill and bass combination. The advantage of it is the crappie are excellent table fare and I slow troll for the crappie as I cast for bass. A bonus crappie every little bit is a blast. Art
1033053,dave524,2018-08-25 13:45:00,4508,"Given the choice of Black Crappie or Rock Bass as an invasive species in a lake, I'd rather the Crappie, we had WGSF's get into a Haliburton smallie lake years ago, fishing was never as good. At least Crappie are tastey."
1033057,Hack_Fisherman,2018-08-25 16:30:00,720,We were at a borrowed cottage so I didn’t keep any. I could have had quite the feed or freezer full  what are WGSF’s??
1033062,grimsbylander,2018-08-25 17:09:00,3016,We need to talk. Lol
1033064,dave524,2018-08-25 17:48:00,4508,"WGSF, World's Greatest Sport Fish , aka Rock Bass . They used to go by that on this board in years past"
1033065,misfish,2018-08-25 18:01:00,29133,Wonder what ever happen to the WGSF guy?
1033141,jimmer,2018-08-27 18:26:00,2730,"I'm sure that crappie are native to the great lakes and have slowly spread to inland lakes through the lock systems, accidental transfer or intentional illegal stocking."
1033143,Lape0019,2018-08-27 18:38:00,647,"If you were fishing the Perth area, they are most definitely native to the area. It's very possible the local has just never caught them before. They aren't exactly easy to locate typically during the summer months. Unless you're going out f you way to catch them in the spring or fall, no one would ever know they were there. I've caught some pretty big one jerkbaiting for bass in the fall. They are a fun fish when you find a school."
1033172,sauce,2018-08-28 01:19:00,219,"I don't know the exact time frame, but a lot of people blame black crappie for the decline of the walleye population on lake scugog. Yes/ no / maybe? I really don't know if this is true or not. There are surely members on this site that could elaborate..."
1033173,David Chong,2018-08-28 01:21:00,836,"Many lakes in that area have Black Crappies that are native! Enjoy, catch lots! Oh BTW they are delicious!"

1033179,Terry,2018-08-28 01:53:00,14456,Many lakes near Perth they are native but scugog and Simcoe didn’t have crappie when I first started fishing the lakes
1033199,misfish,2018-08-28 20:26:00,29133,They were transplanted by seagull poop. LOL  Are Calico bass  crappie? Did we make a new name for the calico? Renamed it crappie? Like walleye vs pickeral.  I remember as a kid catching use ones on GBAY. I was told they were calico bass then ?
1033200,grimsbylander,2018-08-28 20:31:00,3016,I think the calico handle is just another slang name we Canadians are famous for. lol I had to google calico bass and they're actually a saltwater fish.
1033202,misfish,2018-08-28 20:39:00,29133,Well the one I caught was in a marina in port severn. Everyone said it was a calico bass. I thought they were saying chemical bass. LOL
1033203,grimsbylander,2018-08-28 20:49:00,3016,"No, that's Hamilton port!! hahaha"
1033204,Terry,2018-08-28 21:08:00,14456,yup Everyone called them calico bass in the smith falls area years ago
1033225,zippyfx,2018-08-29 12:05:00,5,"Black Crappie are not considered invasive but they having been moving northaward in the province for years. They are becomming more and more common in the Ottawa area. Invasiveness is a tricky subject. As it was in the region it was has not been dicussed as invassive as it was part of our eco system; Likley there is no threat or concern to the local ecosystems as we had similar fish (Small/largemouth bass, Sunfish) with similar habits. Likley the balance of the poplation to some small degree will shift but it is unlikley that oen will win out over the other.  They do have natural predators in the enviroment so they will be in check. That being said Pike are considred invasive in zone 15 as they are affecting the ecosystem as a top of the food chain predator; There ""invasion"" through algonquin park is being tracked very carefully. They are directly impacting the ecosystem of the lakes they are introduced to.  "
