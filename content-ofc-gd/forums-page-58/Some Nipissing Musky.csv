1033214,Joeytier,2018-08-29 00:02:00,3990,Me and a friend made a short little video of a musky trip we made on Nipissing a couple weeks ago.  Lots of musky guys around here (something I am not) so i figured I'd share.

1033281,Rich Clemens,2018-08-29 23:34:00,3131,I'll be up there in 10 days .    Hope they are still hungry.     A week on Nippissing and a week down on the French River
1033283,Joeytier,2018-08-29 23:48:00,3990,"I don't know enough to say whether they will be or not, but I do know the days are getting short and the single digit over night lows are getting common.  Water temps are getting cooler and the fish will be thinking about fall."
1033294,Freshtrax,2018-08-30 04:54:00,2215,Nice saw this one the other day.  I can't imagine the laughs had in the boat with Niko for a day.
