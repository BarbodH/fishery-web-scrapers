1033739,captpierre,2018-09-10 20:25:00,2521,Lucky to catch this girl on a black bucktail jig last week. Eyes have been slow otherwise. Water was 74F. 
1033740,dave524,2018-09-10 20:39:00,4508,"Yeah , nice chompers. I never figured out why a hammerhandle pike can bite you off in the blink of an eye on straight mono and a much larger Walleye can't."
1033750,Dutch01,2018-09-10 22:26:00,1431,"Pike teeth are like a blade, walleye teeth are like a spear tip."
1033834,Canuck,2018-09-11 23:24:00,491,The guys down south think speckled sea trout have nasty teeth.  They ain't got nothin' on a crazy canuck wally.
