1032965,Headhunter,2018-08-23 15:07:00,5703,"Hey folks! I am asking this question on behalf of my brother. He has a fishfinder' that has GPS, temp and speed. I think it's a lowrance. Recently, it is not marking bottom, but all other functions work as they are supposed to. The transducer was checked for proper location, tilt and connections, all looks right. The unit is fairly old. Would it be a reasonable idea to simply change out the transducer? Is this the likely culprit? Ideally, he does not want to buy an entirely new unit. Any advice appreciated! HH"
1032966,Terry,2018-08-23 15:16:00,14456,Older units do burn out transducers the best thing is to try his unit on another ducer older units you should be able to feel the pulse  on the bottom of the ducer  when running 
1032967,grimsbylander,2018-08-23 15:17:00,3016,"Transducers absolutely have a shelf life and need replacing. If the transducer is older than say, 6-8 years, depending on the use it's seen it may need replaced. If possible, try another transducer manually to see if it works."
1032968,grimsbylander,2018-08-23 15:20:00,3016,Terry types faster than I do! lol
1032969,Headhunter,2018-08-23 15:25:00,5703,"Thanks guys! That was my feeling as well, but I sure appreciate you guys chiming in! HH"
1032970,misfish,2018-08-23 16:00:00,29133,"He,s retired thats why. Is it possible he might of left the finder on while out of the water? I did that once and burnt out the transducer. Over heated I was told."
1032971,Headhunter,2018-08-23 18:07:00,5703,Thanks Brian! HH
1032974,David Chong,2018-08-23 19:59:00,836,Transducer do need to be replaced. you can test the unit with another transducer or often you can turn on your unit with the transducer out of the water and you should be able to hear if it is working!
1032975,misfish,2018-08-23 20:03:00,29133,"I can hear mine clicking away on my pontoon, even a foot down in the water."
1032976,Garnet,2018-08-23 20:26:00,2056,Angler Outfitters  Woodstock is a place you might get older transducer.
1032979,grimsbylander,2018-08-23 21:02:00,3016,"This is a fact. It may not be necessary but if I'm largie fishing up shallow(<4') and tight to the boat(flipping docks, wood, etc.), I'll put my graphs on standby. That turns off two transducers from clicking away."
1032980,misfish,2018-08-23 21:08:00,29133,"If Im fishing largies, I don't need a finder going. ?"
1032981,grimsbylander,2018-08-23 21:15:00,3016,"LOL your noggin has build in GPS! hahaha I can't remember what I had for breakfast let alone every dock, stump and weedbed I have marked."
1033144,jimmer,2018-08-27 18:41:00,2730,"I just replaced a transducer on my fish finder. It wouldn't mark the temp and it showed all kinds of wacky depths. It clicked away when it wasn't working, so you can't depend on that as a sign that the transducer is shot. The new transducer fixed everything."
1033148,SirCranksalot,2018-08-27 20:20:00,3291,I was warned by a Lowrance rep not to let it run out of the water for very long---they overheat and burn out. 
1033234,Headhunter,2018-08-29 13:22:00,5703,"Update... he can hear the transducer pinging in the driveway. The main unit seems to be running rather warm, it's warm to the touch. He did contact the folks in Woodstock, Angling Specialties and it looks like a new unit is in order. Thanks to all who chimed in. HH"
