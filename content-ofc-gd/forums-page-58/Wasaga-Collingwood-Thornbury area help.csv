I’m from that area and know my spots and all but don’t know what the run is like this year. I’ve been away at university the past few weeks so I haven’t been able to monitor activity or really talk to anyone knowledgeable about the current fishing in the area. Any help regarding the amount of fish in the area rivers would be much appreciated.  Thank you"
