20806,Rich,2007-01-09 20:30:00,3927,"Well we headed out hoping for pike or crappie to start.. no pike to speak of but one nice crappie after many hours waiting. Nautifish said to give my best smile, so I gave a smile that screams ""I'mmm HAAANNNDSSOMMMMEEE""    After that it was slow.. just 3 small perch between the two of us but oh well better than being at home all day. I also got a sweet new hat, I think it was good luck!    "
