19966,mason05,2007-01-07 17:14:00,258,"I headed out this morning to my local pike hole.  Water levels were really high.  Spent about 2 hours washing a dozen different lures.  Had a couple of follows but nothing looked to be biting.  I was getting ready to pack it in when suddenly ""Wham!"" fish on.  This guy put up a good little scrap including many head shakes.  He took my perch xrap pretty deep but suprisingly he blasted off when he was re-introduced to his home.    First fish of 2007 and I can't beleive it came from soft water in early January.  Cheers,  Corn Nug"

19978,Clampet,2007-01-07 17:45:00,1947,"Cute. I wonder if the toxins are low enough for consumption. Pike that size can be good, 'cept fer the bones."
19983,mason05,2007-01-07 17:57:00,258,Sherriff - It's to bad you couldn't make it.  It was a very nice crisp morning out there.  Clampet - I'm actually allergic to fish but some of my buds have kept them for the pan.  They're all still alive and somewhat normal after eating them.
19996,ccmtcanada,2007-01-07 18:24:00,7971,Great report and congrats on your first fish of 2007!  Your hard work and dedication paid off this time!  Nice Pike too!

20996,kennyman,2007-01-10 05:15:00,737,Nice pike. Love the markings on the fins. Looks like camo (I guess it is). Sweet. I'm Jones'n for some pike action now. Thanks LOL.
