Looking at the action of the bait attached to the Carolina rig you can readily see why it is so effective when the bass are either being defensively aggressive, or opportunistically feeding. As the rig is drawn across the bottom the bait can move, depending on the forces it may encounter, 180 degrees to the distance of the length of the leader. As it hits resistance from weed for example and than releases it can spring right or left, upward, or forward of the weight. This not only gives the bait great action but also covers the water in any direction equal distance from the weight. If the bait moves into the territory of the bass it could react. With this you should also readily see why slow movement of the weight during the retrieve is so important. Whether eating or defending the bass needs the opportunity to decide and by moving slowly you give him that much more chance to decide in your favor. You have all heard many times what is meant by the word slow but I will say it one more time. When you think you are moving the bait slowly then you need to slow down some more.   In order to move the bait slowly you need to use the rod rather than the reel to move the bait. Even if your reel has a slow retrieve it is too fast for the Carolina rig. To understand how to move the rig, picture the baits location as 12 o’clock. Using a dragging motion to the side, move the tip of the rod very slowly from 12 to 2 o’clock. Left-handers would go from 12 to 10 o’clock. The longer the rod, the greater the distance is between 12 and 2, (or 12 and 10), which is why we recommended the longer rod back at the beginning. If you feel a hit during the drag quickly return to the 12 o’clock by picking up the slack with the reel, being sure to keep the line taut, and set the hook. The longer rod also gives you more leverage for the hook set. The key to the reel down is keeping the line taut. If you throw slack line at the bass you will be setting the hook on slack line.   Sensing the hit with the Carolina rig is the same as sensing the hit with any other plastic bait rig. If it feels different than hit it! The bass as I said earlier may be testing it for food quality, or they may be pushing it, or head butting it, so if doubt enters you mind hit it! Another hit to watch for is revealed in line movement. The bass just might pick the bait up and move off to investigate its quality. They do this to hide it from other bass in the vicinity, but rest assured, in most cases if you don’t react they will eventually reject the offering and you will be left holding the bag so to speak. You have probably experienced this as the three tic hit. The bass picks it up, turns, and spits it out in rejection. Get the hit before the third tic!   Setting the hook: Speed is the requirement for a good hookset, not power or distance of the rod sweep!   The Bait: Last and least discussed but certainly extremely important is your choice of baits. However the choice is an easy one to make. Color should be your first consideration and the formula for this is generally dark colors in darker water and light colors in lighter water. Shape and size are experimental and subjective matters. Very little that you throw to the bass for its consideration is going to look anything like the real thing so if you have a bait that you are confident in that would be your best first choice. Remember that your strikes are going to come from either aggression or the possibility of opportunity from the bass so go with what you like. We find that the best of all the plastics on a Carolina rig are the Senkos but again that is a subjective choice. By using a plastic that you have confidence in you will tend to throw it more often rather than giving up and going to another bait.   When fishing an area with this rig, keep in mind that its function by design is to meet the need of placing the bait just about into the mouth of the bass. Be thorough with its use and cover all the water. Too often I see people using this bait like they are throwing spinner bait. Target your casts to land no more than the length of your leader from the last cast and you will be very successful with this bait. Keep it slow, concentrate in order to sense the hit, and aggressively set the hook. Above all, use it long enough to give it the opportunity to show you why it is considered the most effective method of catching the wily bass. It won’t take you long to be a Carolina rig expert.
