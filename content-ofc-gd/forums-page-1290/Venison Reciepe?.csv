20903,walleyejigger,2007-01-10 00:53:00,876,"hey  sorry to hear about the severe allergies must be tough on the family  i have an easy recipe but not sure if it clears your allergy list as i don't have it here so i wasn't able to check the ingredients list  i use this on bear roast and i'm sure venison would be great as well  simply  a pack of lipton's onion soup mix  mix with about 1cup of water pour over roast cook in slow cooker for many hours the longer it's in there the tenderer it'll be  i usually add carrots and potatoes, could put cabbage yellow beans and other veggies (if they're not legumes, that word always confuses me as for a french boy like me ""legume"" is french for vegetable)  if it passes your list try it out you won't be disappointed (and it's super easy)"
20912,Gerritt,2007-01-10 01:06:00,6129,Thanks for the reply walleyejigger... unfortunatly Liptons onion Soup is something we cannot use.  Thanks for the reply though!  Gerritt.

20974,oxcowboy,2007-01-10 03:21:00,544,"heres one that i  like, not sure if all of the ingredients will work for ya though.   venison roast cream of mushroom soup potatoes carrots bell pepper cut into strips spiced to your taste and about 1 cup of water per pound  slow cook untill done.  hope this helps some. jason"
20976,Fisherman,2007-01-10 03:26:00,7201,"The only thing that I can recommend after trying many recipes, is that you must cook(roast) it slow, and keep the temps down around 275 degrees. Start it off in a hot open oiled roasting pan, (Dutch oven is ideal, slow cooker is okay too), sear the meat, then turn the temps down to around 275, add water and put the lid on, check every 1/2 hour to make sure there is some liquid, add what you are allowed to. I would NOT add salt, it takes the moisture out of the meat while cooking, salt to taste afterwards. Make sure you remove any fat from the meat and replace with a bit of beef fat if it's allowed.  Deer fat tastes too harsh."
20977,Crazyhook,2007-01-10 03:33:00,1154,if you like spicy food... mariade the venison in Caribean jerk sauce ( a few hours... then BBQ) then cover in Montreal steak spice  just awesome!
21180,turtle,2007-01-10 23:36:00,274,"I marinate the roast for 24-48 hours in mostly red wine with some red wine vinegar, olive oil, garlic, black pepper and soy sauce (you would want to leave the soy out).  I sear the roast all around in a hot pan then wrap with side bacon. I then cook the roast with the marinade in the pan in a 350 degree oven for 15 (rare) to 20 (well done- max for me) minutes per pound.  Turns out moist, but dont overcook.  I tried the crock pot slow cook method as well but prefer the above."
21276,Cookslav,2007-01-11 03:52:00,1457,"Make this Raspberry Chipotle sauce  1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 cup small diced onion 2 teaspoons minced garlic 2 teaspoons chipotle chiles in adobo, chopped 2 pints fresh raspberries, rinsed 1 cup Rasperry Jam 1/2 cup raspberry vinegar 1 bunch chopped cilantro 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup red wine  and if you can find it....but its hard to find 3 Table spoons of ground Pepperberry(its an Australian spice) Marinate the roast in half the mix overnight. Cook your roast to your likeing, and baste the Roast again with the rest of the sauce with 15 minutes left to caramalize the Glaze a bit.  Serve with a side of rich red wine beef jus or veal demi...but lots of vino is a must!  Absolutley yummm...."
21355,duber,2007-01-11 15:11:00,220,"My favorite recipie is simple put the roast in a roasting pan , wipe the roast down with olive oil , season with salt and pepper , put the oven on grill , put the roast in close to the burner with no lid on and sear the outside of the roast (won't take long) , take it back out and add some wine and lots of FRESH rosemarie and some fresh Italian parsely , put it back in the oven with the lid on and set heat at 275f and cook till it flakes with a fork(4-5 hrs).Add more wine if it gets down on liquid when it is cooking."
