20377,oldphart,2007-01-08 17:03:00,665,"~~~Headed up to Lake Haliburton, to my favorite Ice Phishen hole for some Lakers. The key to catching any phish was bring a boat. It was great getting to my spot with out walkng through 1.5ft. of snow and 4"" on slush, and I Hate Slush. We stopped off at Eagle lake Adventure Bait and Tackle, to get our minnows and check with Terry as to what ramp we could use, the lake was down about 4ft.  He directed us to a safe ramp and we headed out to our spot. we hit the 70ft mark and started marling phish on bottom, so we anchored and right off the bat WalleyeDreamer land his 1st.  and by 1 oclock we  had 5 lakes in the well releasing 2 others losing 7 and this was  the bigest of the day caught by me  Team work played a major part here WD doing his best not to land his Sons phish   Want to thank Terry for checking out the ramps for us, and if the weaher holds, I just may be back up this weekend again with my boat "
