21040,jason27fish,2007-01-10 14:16:00,90,I was just wondering if anyone that is up by orilla could tell me how thick the ice is and when you think that it will finally be safe to go out fishing.
21041,Jer,2007-01-10 14:21:00,1426,My guess would be that it just froze over last night...   ...maybe...
21047,Terry,2007-01-10 14:43:00,14456,"yeah, one day doesn't, isn't couldn't, shouldn't won't,  make near enough ice...but wish it would"
21093,irishfield,2007-01-10 17:43:00,26272,With the winds last night...did it even freeze at all ? !
21109,JPD,2007-01-10 18:45:00,296,"Great point Irish. Winds will wreak havoc on ice formation more than the temps sometimes. No winds and cold temps can get you a couple of inches a night, -20 and 50 km winds gets you nothing but a pile of crap on one end of the lake.  Be careful out there.  JP"
21119,Bernie,2007-01-10 19:16:00,3190,I was just out on a test drive and drove over the bridge that crosses the South River at Powassan. The South River drains into Nipissing. There is still a large amount of water flow. So dont forget guys there will still be this flow at other areas as well. So PLEASE be doggone careful!!!!!!This creates currents in many lakes and will keep ice from forming in certain spots.
21144,irishfield,2007-01-10 20:42:00,26272,I was just to town and back and even though it's still -8C....Not a speck of ice formed on Midland Harbour last night. Not even in the Bay Port Marina docks...so water temp is an issue as much as the wind/waves.
21150,cityfisher,2007-01-10 21:01:00,959,i was up in orillia last night.... no ice anywhere !
