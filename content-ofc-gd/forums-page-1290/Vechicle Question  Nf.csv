20793,Entropy,2007-01-09 19:54:00,747,"  Oh, .... well I just bought one of thouse pigs, and it rides fine !!!!  2000 Chev Tracker, love it!!    A co-worker of mine has just put the third trany in his Honda, just over 90 000 km's.  He bought a honda for the quality, now thinks it's a joke, .. or a lemon."
20796,Bernie,2007-01-09 19:58:00,3190,The 2000 Tracker is not a bad vehicle..Mostly Suzuki engineering.
20799,Entropy,2007-01-09 20:07:00,747,"Went to pick up an air filter ... $35 !!!!! omg, I guess that's the suzuki in it.... much more that the $7 one for my 350 chev.  Any one know of a cheaper air filter for a 2000 Chev Tracker 4 door, with 4x4, and A/C 2.0L?  One that will do as good as job but cheaper?"
20801,Guidofisherman,2007-01-09 20:10:00,206,"I've been a Ford guy since 1966, but that is about to change. I've owned several Ford sedans, a couple of F150s and currently own two SUVs (1991 and 2002). The reliability after a few years is terrible. I bought out the 2002 Explorer lease thinking it was great and even bought the best extended warranty for it. In the past year and half, it has been in 5 times for transmission repairs, two drive shafts and still there is rear end noise. Just two weeks ago the small tailgate split in two. That cost me $350 as it is not covered. I have written to Ford with no reply. Locally, they said it was a ""known issue"".  I have since torn up the new lease agreement for my wife's car. I am going Japanese. Alan"
20805,Bernie,2007-01-09 20:18:00,3190,entropy...there are a lot of aftermarket air filters makers out there. My suggestion is to get a quality filter. I think your model has a mass air flow sensor. (I dont know if you have the 1.6 or 2.0 engine) .There are technical service bulletins out for a lot of manufacturers that state do not use aftermarket filters that contain oil  in the filter. (K&N as an example) These can contaminate the sensor and cause a buildup of debris on the hotwire. This will give the ECU(computer) false airflow readings and reduce fuel economy. This is true-seen it for for myself.
20807,ccmtcanada,2007-01-09 20:34:00,7971,"My mother and father-in-law have been long time GM employees.  She no longer works there, but he does.  They've always bought GM because of their discounts....they said they'd always do so because of that.  When I came into the picture, she asked me what car I'd buy.  Talk about a loaded question seeing that I'm Japanese....LOL.  I decided to be honest and I said my next car would be a Toyota Camry.....for comfort and reliability.  She just said ""Oh...."".  Next thing I hear is that she's going car shopping.  After test driving  GMs at a local dealer, she spies a Toyota dealership on the way home.  She pulls in and test drives the Camry.  She bought it!!!! LOL.  She's very happy with it and has never had any problems......"
20827,ecmilley,2007-01-09 21:58:00,2163,"the gap has really narrowed beween domestics and offshore  manufacturing these days in the last 5 years there has been a  noticeable increase in quality in gm cars. Iknow and work in this industry as well, the jap cars biggest problems seem to be power windows, brake longevity and  transmission troubles (honda toyota nissan mazda)as well as higher maintenance costs. the gm cars seem pretty solid with the exception of the odd crapcan same for ford, i am not a fan of chrysler but the are getting better as well(other than the mini-van) No matter what you buy it is always a gamble there is good and bad, my parents have 2 equinox's no troubles happy with them, sister has saturns great car till 200k then started to have some minor probs, i have a hyundai (2003 tiburon) with 308k and no real problems to speak of."
20901,Steve,2007-01-10 00:42:00,2075,"Clampet, do u have any suggestions for my situation?"
20938,pigeonfisher,2007-01-10 02:25:00,696,try the Nissan Armada...you will be truly impressed.  The Pathfinder would also suit almost all of your applications I am sure.  Otherwise look for an old Land Cruiser.
21003,Steve,2007-01-10 12:07:00,2075,"thanks for the help all....  i think its good to see when it comes to work trucks, trucks that are going to be used, the domestic companies still rule.....  my foreign options are very very slim. two or three options. Domestic i could look at at least six or seven models.  although the domestic manufacturers have a long way to come to join the imports regarding cars, when talking trucks, the domestic market still has the strongest vehicles.  who knows what i end up with, but it'll be better than my chevy lumina car for towing."
21009,Chris,2007-01-10 12:56:00,405,"I don't think GM gets it.   Saw on the news last night how GM is concerned that Toyota will soon be bumping them out of the number one spot regarding the sales of North American internal combustion powered vehicles. To gain back lost ground GM is concentrating on better styling. Better styling???? Just my opinion, but they should forget trying to lure customers with pretty cars and useless electronic features and concentrate on quality. Frankly, their stuff is cheap junk.  Whoever mentioned the $35.00 import air filter should replace a wheel bearing on a GM. I was quoted over $400 by GM just to purchase a wheel bearing....no installation. I had a local garage install an after-market wheel bearing for $280.00. (Still overpriced but a far cry from GM's price).  The only reason domestic trucks are bigger sellers is because the imports are just breaking into the full-size truck market and don't have the selection of vehicles that the domestics provide.  I personally have trouble believing that the gap between domestic and import quality has shrunk. The quality of GM products has certainly not been improved in the last 5 years. I guess when a company spends more per vehicle on pensions than on steel the quality has to go downhill.  Good luck Steve if ya buy GM.....you're gonna need it."
21017,Harrison,2007-01-10 13:30:00,2202,"Die Hard buy North American products guy here, I have owned trucks from all 3 domestics.  But, with a new family, somewhat fixed income, I put the odds in our favour for reliability...  I now drive a Toyota.  Steve, 4 Runner all the way.  Friend has one, IMO allround wicked working machine.  From 4wheelin into back lakes to towing his 19ft pro V."
21024,Steve,2007-01-10 13:50:00,2075,thanks for that advice Harrison.  I'll definitely take a Hard Look at the 4Runner when making my purchase. Any year(s) better or worse than another?
21025,jason27fish,2007-01-10 13:55:00,90,Gm is going down
21049,Harrison,2007-01-10 14:50:00,2202, That I am not sure about.  His is a 2002 I think.  Searching for a pic of it half way out in Frenchmans bay launching the boat in feb but can't find it to answer your queenston inquiry.  Good Luck with it.
21094,Steve,2007-01-10 17:49:00,2075,"again, thanks harrison.  its tough when i go to the dealerships and they recommend some little s10 or something because i'm not towing too much....however, when i try to explain some of the various launching conditions i've been through, they just roll their eyes and recommend me a little pickup.  now frenchmans bay in february, thats the kind of launching conditions i will be doing.....i took a couple pictures of my launching conditions with me to the honda dealership when i went there.....the launching in january at pyzners/Quinte had him calling me nutz, and advising me that honda hasn't released anything that would be of my benefit....but at least he was being honest.  I'm checking 4runners right now, and they are rather affordable....i think i'll try testdriving a couple 2004 4Runners.....  thanks again man.  (spring salmon is less than 3 months away.   )"
21099,Raf,2007-01-10 18:00:00,3495,"steve, a 4runner or pathfinder with proper tires and 4x4 should have no issues.  they are thirsty for a 6cyl particularly when towing though (shouldn't use OD thus your RPMs are higher).  i use my jeep cherokee and have launched on some icy/crappy launches as well.  flip it into 4x4 and no problems.  biggest boat so far has been a 17ft lund side console w/90 4stroke.  i have no doubt that it could pull a bigger boat, the issue with the cherokee are the crappy stock brakes.  a surge brake on the trailer would certainly help with that."
21100,Steve,2007-01-10 18:06:00,2075,"the 8 cylinder model for 4runner is what i was looking at, but it appears both the 6 and the 8 cylinder model engines need premium octane gas?  i hope that isn't the case, as the costs associated go way up."
21101,SHAD,2007-01-10 18:10:00,134," Now I know your fibbing, lol!  You would never go to a Honda dealership and you don't fish..........BURN!  Has schmelly finally seen the light and the errors of the north american made vehicle"
20338,thud,2007-01-08 14:34:00,5,"Hi guys, I work at the autoplant that makes the Equinox/Torrnet in Ingersoll, Ontario.  Our plant is a GM/ Suzuki joint venture.  Meaning that we build based on the Japanese way of building cars. I am just a monkey on the line but our plant ranks at the top of GM's North America operations for quality.  The Equinox/Torrnet actually replaced the chevy Tracker.  They totally gutted the plant and brought in new tooling.  We don't share any parts with the Aztex.  The Saturn Vue is based on the same platform as the Equniox/Torrent.  The new Suzuki XL-7 is an extended version that we started building in September.  I shop at my local fishing store instead of BPS, because I get better service and my money stays in the community.  The same thing should go for large purchases (when possible).  If you have a choice in new vehicles and one is built in Ontario, I hope that we would rather buy local so that Ontario can keep the jobs here.  I don't want to preach here everyone can make their own choices but our kids will need jobs someday."
20350,Bernie,2007-01-08 14:55:00,3190,Buying a GM car right now is like being a Maple Leafs fan. The product is there and its not very good. People keep going to the games but why?  Ps..I dont like the way it is. I know we should support local business. I want domestic product to do well. I just wish they would pull up their socks and get it done!
20428,Fisherman,2007-01-08 19:54:00,7201,"That's like saying we cleaned out the barn, but brought in some new cows and pigs. Ya, it still smells like crapola."
20471,thud,2007-01-08 21:15:00,5,I was just trying make the point that no tooling was carried over between platforms (tracker to equinox) Using you analogy we went from pigs to cows.
20491,Bernie,2007-01-08 21:48:00,3190,"Hi Thud...I wasn't questioning the way they are put together what is questioned is the engineering and quality of material. Kudos go out to the guys on the line. I once worked for Ford. I know how a lot of it goes. In the last month we had two domestic 2003 vehicles in here with rusted out brake lines. Ball joints and tie rod ends on some even newer with less than 40k on them.  What can I say? My customers ask me..What should I buy? Japanese does excel. I have to tell them how I feel. My peers will agree. In my line of business I prefer working on domestic cars. Parts availability and prices, information on servicing and so forth makes them easier to repair but necessary to repair more often. How do I feel when a young familys car needs a new front wheel bearing on their 3 year old but out of warranty vehicle that they have another 2 or 3 years to pay on? I feel like rolling my toolbox into the creek and go back to driving truck. But I refuse to stick my head in the sand. I will help them the best I can.  Thats enough  ...my rant ..no more from me on this."
20512,holdfast,2007-01-08 22:33:00,1813,"Again, Check out CAA and CR before making that big purchase.  Id like to buy a car where the warranty will outlast the payments.  All I know is that I owned a new Hyundai Pony in 87, a new Nisson Multi in 90, a new Sentra in 94 and now a 99 Civic I bought last year with 101,000 KMs for less than $6000 and no warranty, but chances are its going to last for 300,000 Kms. I now have 127,000 with only oil changes. If you buy new make sure the warranty outlasts the payments, if thats possible.  My wife bought a 5 year old Mazda protege that lasted 6 years with only minor repairs.  Again it was a car that was less than $5,ooo dollars and had about 57,000 Kms.  I figure you got to be either rich, or stupid to buy brand new these days.  Jap cars rule and if it wasnt for import taxes, we would not have any domestic cars or jobs.  Junk, junk and poor warrantys.  Seems like the only people that like domestic HERE, are the prod workers and mechanics."

20771,Steve,2007-01-09 18:49:00,2075,"Question for those who dislike the north american vehicles.  I'm looking at buying a four wheel drive SUV, that has a V8 Engine. Currently i'm looking at a 2005 or 2006 Tahoe.  Is there ANY foreign market vehicle that could be trusted towing out of the Niagara River in February?  I know the cars are better build overseas, but is there an SUV (i dont need a pickup, as i need the room inside an SUV for rods), that can meet my needs that isn't domestic?  I've spoke to a few auto dealerships, including the Honda dealership, and when showing him teh launching conditions on the niagara river and quinte in the winter months, he said he wouldn't recommend any Honda's for my purpose.  I'd like to at least weigh my 'foreign options', but so far i've yet to find one. I know about the Armada, and thats just too expensive."
20773,jediangler,2007-01-09 18:51:00,1923,"This might be a side-step but, the Aztec was made in Ramos Mexico along with the Sunfire. This plant now builds the Rendezvous for Buick and the HHR for Chevy. This is Mexico's oldest GM plant and this is the best they can do? I'd trust the Ingersol boys with their affiliation with Suzuki first. I work with owners of both the Torrent and the Equinox. They have had no problems in the first year of ownership. I would look at a Toyota Highlander and pay the extra bucks for the reliability that will surely outlast anything GM can offer.  Hey Steve, try to take out a Toyota FJ Cruiser, it's a six cyl but should be plenty powerful enough. If you must have an 8 cyl, try the 4runner. If they are too expensive it is because they are far superior in quality."
20776,Steve,2007-01-09 19:03:00,2075,"actually, the 4Runner is a little cheaper for the comparable year and km Tahoe.  never wanted to own a Toyota though....hmmm.....  do u know anyone who has ever used a 4Runner for real work situations? Id love to talk to someone who has put their 4Runner through some extreme conditions.....  (not saying it wont at all, just would love to hear some first hand knowledge...)  Thanks for the advice."
20780,jediangler,2007-01-09 19:16:00,1923,"Had a buddy at work who used a 4runner to haul 2 jetskis on a trailer for many years. His was a 1995 model and he had 375,000km on it when he rolled it in 2001."
20787,Bernie,2007-01-09 19:31:00,3190,"Out of curiosity Dan, did you look at the Honda Ridgeline? I haven't researched them for towing capacity but you would think it should be capable of a good sized boat. The back end should be lockable for your rods and stuff. Once you have a pickup its hard to live without them."
20789,ecmilley,2007-01-09 19:35:00,2163,if you like the tahoe stick with it a v-8 toyota or nissan real world conditions they are worse on fuel than the gm 5.3 l v-8
