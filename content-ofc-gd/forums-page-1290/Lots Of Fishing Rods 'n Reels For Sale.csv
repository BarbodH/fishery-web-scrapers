As we wait for hard water to get our ice fishing season underway, thought I'd re-post a Classifieds ad for a pile of rods and reels I have for sale.  Just to be forthright, I did post this stuff back in the late fall but I think I may have had lofty expectations regarding how much I would be able to get for the stuff.  So, if anyone got sticker shock when I sent you my original list, I apologize for that.  Good news is, I've done my homework this time, and the new list is priced in keeping with re-sale of preowned and brand new merchandise.  Plus, THERE'S SOME BRAND NEW ST. CROIX RODS IN THE MIX!!!  So, go check out the ad and hopefully we can do some deals.  Kind regards, Paul"
