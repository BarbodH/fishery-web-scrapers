19777,Bernie,2007-01-06 20:25:00,3190,Wow...and I thought I fished quite a bit..Nothing compared to that...congrats to you and your wonderful lifestyle. Some dandy fish there.
19785,jediangler,2007-01-06 20:50:00,1923,"Wow, you're my hero. I'd say that would be a decade's worth of fish for me. Wish I could get out on the water as often as you do. In 1993, when I was unemployed, I got out 73 times. I guess that's why they call them the ""Good old days"". Looking forward to all your reports for 2007.  You've got my vote for OFC'er of the year."
19819,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-07 00:55:00,0,"Nice recap MB, great pictures and post."
19999,Squid,2007-01-07 18:52:00,1656,Nice pictures there Moose!! Were those lakers caught off the niagara bar?
20007,trapshooter,2007-01-07 19:18:00,1234,"Wow!!  Awesome pics, stories and stats MB.  Thanks for sharing.  Cheers, ben."
20015,setomonkey,2007-01-07 20:04:00,872,"What a year, thanks for the overview and reminder of some of the great reports you've postd in 2006.  As a fellow geek, I'm impressed with the numbers you posted too. Lots of interesting details, though the one that got me is how many days you managed (62).  That's probably 2-2.5 seasons of fishing days for me.  I've got to get out more.  Mike"
20030,Moosebunk,2007-01-07 20:55:00,3970,"Thanks OFC'ers, always a pleasure posting reports here as the gang is always super supportive.  It was one heckuva good year, just wish I could have gotten out more.   The period in July and August with the motor down and out, the early flash freeze on the river in November causing the boat to go away, and a back injury set me back about 8-10 fishing outings.  Shift work sure has it's perks as it gives me about 200 or more days off a year.  Again, glad the reports from the north give pleasure to some.  I sure enjoy making them happen.   Next year should be alright too."
20052,Britmick,2007-01-07 21:36:00,29,"Thank you for the superb report Moosebunk, its always a treat to read your latest news and see your wonderful pictures.  Sadly we get to Canada all too often and certainly not to your area, but the scenery pictures take my mind off living in the overcrowded S.E. of England.  Great stuff, Mick"
20086,The Urban Fisherman,2007-01-07 23:09:00,2050,wow!  Good idea on the record keeping! I didn't catch enough fish in '06 to have to write it down! haha  Gook Luck in '07!  UF
20569,dustink,2007-01-08 23:58:00,526,"Not sure how I missed this report, but WOW.  Great Year in Review, MB!  Thanks for taking the time to share awesome stories with us.  I hope you have a great 2007....and share the adventures with us!  dk"
20608,GbayGiant,2007-01-09 02:21:00,1780,Your going to need a personal accountant for those numbers.  Nice pics.
20734,Cookslav,2007-01-09 17:18:00,1457,Man... looks like a great year for you...to bad about the summer that never came. But then again you made out like a bandit with 62 days on the water!!!! I just showed that to my wife....she can't say much about my measly 5 trips This year   I think the Stat collecting is a cool idea...I might give that a shot next season just for kicks
20897,Tacklebuster,2007-01-10 00:35:00,303,"Can't get enough of your reports, thanks."
19575,Moosebunk,2007-01-06 04:43:00,3970,"Tonnes of pic's here as 2006 was another wonderful year on the waters all over Ontario.   Winter was highlighted by 3 different trips and a dozen or so days around home on the Moose.  In February a small group of us skidoo'd 80km up to Halfway Point for brookies, a trip that produced no fish but was an awesome ride north.  Early March my oldest daughter and I joined friends on Temagami for a good bonding experience.  Late March saw Floatfishin' and Fishforfun join Bren and I for Kesagami pike and eyes, and, we slayed 'em good.   1st fish of 2006.                   Spring came in early and because of it I was able to get my boat on the water earlier than normal.  With pike open all year up here I ended up targetting them more often and it unfortunately meant giving up some time for searun specks.  The budding season was highlighted by the walleye opener on the Cheepas and Moose rivers, but it also became a season where I hosted more folks than usual and we had some good successful outings. June 6th I pinned a personal best walleye on a pink grub.                        Summer and fall next post below.  Summer never actually came.  The months that were supposed to be warm and dry were wet and all over the place.  I remember a little snow late one night in August as well when camping with the kids.  The few things that saved the season were the trips to M-Cabi and the Ekwan River, a week off on Snare Lake, five days south with buddies, and the boat project.  Ekwan with my brother in law ended up basically the highlight of the year, and on that trip a personal best pike for weight was landed.                       Autumn was tough.  Fishing was tough.  Winter was seemingly coming early and prematurely the boat was put away.  I usually love the fall pike season but this year they were a month behind I'd bet on stacking at the backbays where whities go to spawn.  A trip south at the end of September followed by a last kick at the can for lakers after Xmas made the long waits for frozen ice a little more bearable.  Some different species were caught but my pride and joy was catching my first brown trout.                       Now, for the geeky stuff.  Yeah, I keep good records.  I imagine most would if they lived where I do and found they had the time I have.  So here's some stuff I find interesting.  Total fish recorded.  331 + 185+/- (M-cabi/Ekwan) Total fish 516.  Pike 178, walleye 264, bass 38, trout 16.  Best fishing weather at home, calm, sunny and hot.  Total fishing days = 62. (67 in 2005)  Total hours 276.5 making an average of 4.5 hours per outing.  No catch days = 10.  (17 in 2005)  Days out with the family for fishing = 15. (8 in 2005)  Average catch per outing = 5.34 fish (8.32 fish incl. M-Cabi and Ekwan trips).  2002 was 2.95, 2003 = 3.18, 2004 = 3.32, 2005 = 5.06 (6.80 incl M-Cabi trip)  Average catch per hour = 1.2 / 1.87 (M&E)  Goals met. Increase catch average, new PB walleye, family out 12 or more times, catch 1 new species.  Goals not met, catching 1st lake sturgeon and new PB brookie.  Next years goals, PB pike 20lb+, increase catch average, catch 1 new species, catch at least 10 brookies.  Geeeeeeeeeek I told ya.  Bring on 07."
19579,G-loomis,2007-01-06 04:53:00,19,"wow!!! nice pics, I like the pic where the plane is on the ice, keep them coming."
19580,douG,2007-01-06 04:59:00,2693,"Ahhh.  Now I understand how to do it.  Congratulations on a terrific year (more fish and hours fishin than any other OFNer, I would expect).  For anyone who has in their sad,  pathetic lifetimes ever wetted a line, that post is a fastasy come true.  Amazing fish, scenery, and fish as well.  Thanks, Moosebunk.  We could do with more pics of your kids, tho, darn cute."
19581,Moosebunk,2007-01-06 05:02:00,3970,"The hungry household kept a few too.  10 pike, 82 walleye and 7 trout.  Tonights dinner I called the ""Lake Erie Feed.""  Cedar smoked rainbow trout with an onion, pepper, mango and curry salsa, and, walleye bacon tornadoes marinated in balsamic vinaigrette and strawberry juice.  Never eat too much fish.  It's the best meat for ya.   How true."

19666,Rich Clemens,2007-01-06 13:46:00,3131,"Now that is what I call a report !!  Great fishing through the seasons, lots of time on the water, familty along.  Sounds like a great year and an even better one yet to come."
19672,Clampet,2007-01-06 13:53:00,1947,"You got some dandies! I noticed some of the Pike in the first few pictures look quite lean. The waters must be relatively clean, and the fish look very healthy."
19679,steve_paul,2007-01-06 14:09:00,658,"Awesome report MB, thanks for sharing your year with us.  Amazing pics, beautiful scenery, great fish."
19685,pameladallaire,2007-01-06 14:34:00,470,"Thanks for the summary.  We are still waiting for the book version.   Seriously,  consider a book of fishing in the north. You'd make a great writer.   I'd buy a copy.  Pam"
19691,Smokey,2007-01-06 14:47:00,1278,I knew this would be a great read and of course always great pics. Thanks for the report on your year and congrats on a sucessful year.  Mike
