One of many many perch.   approaching the first Trent/Severn lock N. of Couchiching.   Some boats in the lock after the water has drained.     Looking down at the lock   Wife hiding behind shades   The knife is soon to come.   My son's first Smallie   Here is one of many we caught that day   The boat gets a clean up.   So this is how to polish your boat the easy way, buy an electric polisher on sale for 20 bucks and let your son play with it.   I was going to post a few more, but that should do it for now.  Oh yeah.. ignore the time stamps on the pics, I didn't notice thaat it was wrong until it was too late."
