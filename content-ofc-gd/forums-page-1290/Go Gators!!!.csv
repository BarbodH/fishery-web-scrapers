20617,Crazyhook,2007-01-09 03:15:00,1154,looking great so far!
20656,Rich Clemens,2007-01-09 11:02:00,3131,Yeah ... Don't think many were expecting a blowout by Florida State.  Now they have National Titles in basketball and football.
20681,tomO,2007-01-09 13:47:00,363,"Boy, what happened to Ohio State. They weren't in it at all. Oh well any team can have a bad game,they had a great season nothing to be ashamed of."
20685,dustink,2007-01-09 14:00:00,526,Yeah...that was a trip to the woodshed for the boys from Columbus!  Ouch!  dk
20687,Whopper,2007-01-09 14:12:00,2174," mudbutt I could give you a whole list of things that happen to Ohio State but now it's a mute point. Really disappointed that a Jim Tressel coached team looked the way they did from top to bottom. Congrats to the Florida Gators they truly deserved it. Can't recall the buckeyes under Coach Tressel looking that bad, kind of reminded me of the Cooper era. The only bright spot I witnessed was a local kid that grew up minutes from my house and have known him since he was about six years old was Marcus Freeman #1 on the buckeyes roster played a decent game.  Whopper"

20864,bucktail,2007-01-09 23:30:00,1857,I couldn't get into the game at all this year. There was WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too much time off between games this year. It felt like the start of the 2007 season not the end of the 2006 season.
