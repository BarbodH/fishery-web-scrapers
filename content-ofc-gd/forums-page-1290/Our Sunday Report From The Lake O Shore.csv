20678,Guest mistyriver1,2007-01-09 13:42:00,0,"Corey and I hit the islands area on Sunday to try for some pike.  The weather was beautiful, slight overcast and no wind (5 degrees).  Threw a bunch of baits but no takers.  The day wasn't an entire loss though, ran into some nice wildlife.  First was this guy....      Further along the shore, we ran into a few of these guys...       Lastly, we ran into this little guy.  I've been told it's a wood duck, is this correct ? I'm not sure what he was but he was sure nice looking.   I really like this shot...I caught him just as he was diving for some fish...   Even when you don't get any fish, it's still nice to get out.  Jim"

20769,dwc67,2007-01-09 18:46:00,140,nice  the colds coming 14 day forecast says it's supposed to be frigid next week
20840,walleyejigger,2007-01-09 22:34:00,876,"very nice pics, especially the duck diving,  im no expert on ducks but know a little and it doesn't really look like a wood duck to me, if it is it's a female with very odd colour patches, at first look i would have said maybe a gadwall???????"
20844,bigfish1965,2007-01-09 22:38:00,3382,Duck looks like maybe an Oldsquaw?? Can't believe the turtles aren't hibernating!
20845,Pigeontroller,2007-01-09 22:39:00,2793,"Wow, a Red Eared Slider! Those Turtles are native to the southern USA, I wonder how he got there?  Nice pics Misty."
20846,Sinker,2007-01-09 22:42:00,8692,Nice pics........the duck is a hen Oldsquaw......or long tailed duck.  Sinker
