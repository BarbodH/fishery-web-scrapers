Just in time for my vacation  I don't know how to do the link thing, but here it is  http://www.theweathernetwork.com/weather/1...es/CAON0040.htm  Happy winter  Maureen"
21033,jason27fish,2007-01-10 14:06:00,90,cant wait for the ice but down here its supposed to be a warm weekend with rain on friday. but from then on it looks good
21036,Jer,2007-01-10 14:09:00,1426,"Glad to see it Maureen,  We have a (already rescheduled) trip to Nipissing next Friday. The forecast looks good for some solid ice making til then. Out in front of my place, Buckhorn is frozen almost all the way across for the first time since before the new year."
21089,irishfield,2007-01-10 17:35:00,26272,That wind would have kept most wide open areas from freezing last night due to wave action. This snow fall won't help ice formation unfortunately!  I also need the snow to melt again...and that looks like Friday up here Maureen. I cut up a bunch of wood on Sunday afternoon and it's now lying under the snow and needs to be found and split!
