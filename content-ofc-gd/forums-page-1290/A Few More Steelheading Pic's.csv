20791,solopaddler,2007-01-09 19:49:00,8605,"Now that I've figured out how to do this properly, here's a bunch more pic's. Some scenery shots along with some fish. Some are recent, most are from earlier this fall. Enjoy!             These last 2 are really cool. It's really hard to capture shots like these usually...   Cheers!"

21004,Harrison,2007-01-10 12:17:00,2202,Nice shots... not the same ole' cookie cutters either hahha.. kidding.  ps. how many shots went to waste to get those sweet airbourne ones?  Wasted to many to count myself...
21005,solopaddler,2007-01-10 12:31:00,8605,"The airborne shots were taken by a good friend of mine who forwarded them to me (I'm standing beside my friend Dave who's fighting the fish). Anyhow, the shots were taken with a standard 35mm camera believe it or not, nothing special. That particular fish was out of the water probably 20 times, don't think he wasted too many shots, just got lucky! And yeah, the fish pics I posted are all wild Georgian Bay and Lake Huron chromers (definitely not cookie cutters)  cheers"
21030,jason27fish,2007-01-10 14:01:00,90,nice report the pics of the fish jumping are just amazing
