I got the first bass of a white spinner bait and the second off a perch coloured xrap if memory serves me correctly.      TJ was asking about the island in my sig pic.  I figure I'd post a larger image of it.  Excellent example of the good 'ol boys having a blast and getting eaten alive by black flies.  I'm third from the left in the back row.    Just thought I'd fire some pics out on a quiet night here on OFC.  Cheers,  Corn Nug"
