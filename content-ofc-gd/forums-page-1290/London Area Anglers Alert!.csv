The guest speaker this month is Jeff Brick from the Upper Thames River Cons. Auth.  Also on tap, the Brown trout are in the hatchery and already at swim up stage. What to do with the walleye hatchery (dismantle or status quo) What's going on with Springbank dam and the now defunct London Sport Fishery, and info on the annual boathouse sale, and hopefully some info on the new website, and as always tons of SCUTTLEBUTT!  Hope to see some new faces out there. Thanks  jjcanoe   http://www.anglers.org"
