21059,Hooked,2007-01-10 15:31:00,891,"Thats not an ice hut, thats my new home!  Wow, why would you ever want to leave that?  That is NICE."
21061,Rich,2007-01-10 15:34:00,3927,That's one heck of a garden shed

21086,snag,2007-01-10 17:24:00,1932,"My new winter home, sweet!"
21154,Hooked,2007-01-10 21:10:00,891,"I think if the owner would add some pontoons, would make an awesome craft on the soft water too!  I think I'm in love."
21164,huntervasili,2007-01-10 22:43:00,1604,Even has sattelite eh... sure didnt leave a thing that most people have at their house out... except maybe an INDOOR freezer
21177,Bernie,2007-01-10 23:28:00,3190,No trees to block the sun to the solar panel either.
21181,Carp,2007-01-10 23:45:00,1488,"  We use a metal bar to lift the hut and place 2x4's under the edges to keep it from freezing to the ice. The gap is filled up with snow on the ice surface. If the sun warms the ice surface enough to allow the 2x4's to sink a bit, we just put more wood under it. Sometimes it's necessary to chip a bit of ice along the edges before raising the hut.  At the end of the season, there's usually enough ice to get the hut off safely. The operator who stores our hut during the off season, also puts it out and brings it in for us. He uses a large metal framed sleigh attached to his ATV. He keeps an eye on the ice conditions and will bring the huts in a bit before season's end if necessary, but it's never been a problem yet. Last year, there was good ice too late in the season, so the huts never saw the lake.  A few years it's been late January or early February befoe the hut got out on the lake. Last year is the first time I can remember we didn't get the hut out on the lake for the entire season. Hope it gets frigid in a hurry. I'm praying for -30 Celcius....... but just for a few days."

20958,Carp,2007-01-10 02:51:00,1488,"WOW !!!  Your right Joey. If I had a hut like that, why would I want to leave ?  Beds, TV, magazines, comfy chairs, microwave, toaster oven, frying pans, solar power, satellite dish, lots of storage space, wood stove for heating and cooking, etc, etc.  Looks like about an 8 x 12 ft. beauty. Lots of work went into that hut. Must weigh an awful lot though. I'd be scared to catch a fish and get slime all over the place."
20961,Crazyhook,2007-01-10 02:53:00,1154,that is just awesome!
20962,irishfield,2007-01-10 02:55:00,26272,So...how do you dig something like that back out of the ice to get if off before melt down?
20963,Mike the Pike,2007-01-10 02:59:00,3421,Thats simple Wayne an F-150 will do the job we have seen the pictures of what your truck can pull.  Which hole is the toilet?
20979,urbanangler1990,2007-01-10 03:37:00,933,  First available    thats a castle of a hut!
20988,JerseyDog,2007-01-10 04:02:00,190,"WOW!  If you look on the back, he appears to have some kind of hitch apparatus also installed.  Apparently he didn't forget a thing when putting the hut together (except perhaps a steel door and about 50 locks!)."
20994,Sherriff,2007-01-10 04:47:00,252,"WOw, I may actually get the wife out on the ice in a hut like that...  Sherriff"
21006,Blake,2007-01-10 12:35:00,418,That's ice fishing in style.  Even with my bad back I could still go out in that one.  Great idea and planning WOW.
