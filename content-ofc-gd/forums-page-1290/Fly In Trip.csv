20861,solopaddler,2007-01-09 23:27:00,8605,"In that area I've flown a bunch of times with Hawk Air out of Hawk Junction about 30km east of Wawa. The lakes are mostly on the smaller side, but are generally very good fishing, and unlike a lot of the lakes north and east of there which are mostly shallow, featureless, ""dishpan"" lakes typical of the James Bay lowlands, these lakes are generally a bit more rocky, clear and deep with more typical Canadian shield terrain. Most of their lakes are Walleye and Pike lakes, but they do have some Brook Trout and Lake Trout lakes as well. I can personally recommend Duffy, Wejin, Little Missinaibi Pichogen and Puskuta for Walleye and Pike, and Mcrea and South Greenhill for Brookies. Below is a pic of a decent pike I caught in Pichogen a few years back..... good luck! "

21078,TennesseeGuy,2007-01-10 16:57:00,957,"douG, be sure to have Jim Booi demonstrate filleting fish with his broad ax.  Good luck at Trout Lake."
21079,dustink,2007-01-10 16:59:00,526,"I've flown with Hawk Air several time, and had the same good experiences as solopaddler.    Breckenridge Lake - Pike, Walleye  Easey Point - Pike Walleye  Daisey - Pike    Hawk Air's website    Good luck!  dk"
21087,lew,2007-01-10 17:25:00,12767,VERY impressive pike solopaddler !!
21088,TennesseeGuy,2007-01-10 17:34:00,957,Right Lew.  And she has an empty belly.  I'd like to see a photo of her when her stomach is full.
21102,iceguy,2007-01-10 18:18:00,341,Thanks fishless cause of this post I'm gonna have to try some Wawa fly in fishing... Sounds like a few guys here had a good time with that Hawk air. Checked out there website and looks pretty solid. Good luck with the trip.
21106,solopaddler,2007-01-10 18:32:00,8605,"Actually, that pike was caught in mid-Sept when it was probably as fat and robust as it would ever get. The forage base in most of those small lakes is restricted to Walleye and Perch which makes growing big pike pretty difficult. Anharea Lake (another of Hawk Air's lakes) is one notable exception. It's a deep, clear, lake trout/pike lake, with a substantial whitefish population as well. Lots of juicy, high protein soft-finned forage! I would say that in general, catching a really big pike in any of those lakes is more of a fluke than anything. If you really want to target them up there it's pretty much a seasonal fishery: be the first group in there in May when they open, and fish the typical early spring pike spots.....They're all very consistent walleye lakes however, which is what I primarily fly in for up there anyway."

21166,Smokey,2007-01-10 22:48:00,1278,I flew out with Hawk air about 7 yrs ago or so to Goat lake. The weather was warm and the fishing was slow but had a great time. His camps are in great shape as are the boats and motors. The walk over to little goat was worth it with bigger fish.
