So far the days have been beautiful, a few showers, and a bit of wind but reasonably warm. This morning the sun is shining, the seas are calm, I think I am goingto have a steak and eggs then spend the rest of the day sitting on the pier enjoying the sun and meeting some of the locals.  Have a super day all!"
