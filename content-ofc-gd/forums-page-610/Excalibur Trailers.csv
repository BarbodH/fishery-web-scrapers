521000,spooner_jr,2010-11-17 19:55:00,193,I had one of their boat trailers for a couple of years. No issues with it.
521013,Fang,2010-11-17 20:36:00,1330,no experience with their trailers but when my boat trailer was in needs of parts and repair they were great to deal with. Got everything I needed and prices were very good.  I've been looking at their ATV trailers and tryng to get some pricing.

521566,FSNmachine,2010-11-19 21:08:00,22,I bought a boat trailer from them in 2007 and sold it this spring with the boat but had no issues with the workmanship or the materials. It never saw salt or winter being a boat trailer and their price was a selling factor for sure.
