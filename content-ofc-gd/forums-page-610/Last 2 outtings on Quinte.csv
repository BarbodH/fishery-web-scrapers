520760,Gman,2010-11-17 01:09:00,126,"Fished Quinte the past 2 weekends and it’s been slow. Absolutely gorgeous days to be outdoors and in a boat taking in the scenery however those beautiful high pressure days with little to no wind which are a true rarity at this time of year are keeping the water temps up and the fishing slow.  You really have to work at grinding’em out and keeping your baits in the water as much as possible.  After this week’s visit the temps are still at 52 degrees in the reach. Plenty of boat activity which is expected given the weather and no real pattern as we heard people catching fish on this color, that color this speed and that.  The most consistent bite I would have to say has been the jigging bite (which we're not doing) with a bunch of eaters being caught with some piggies in the mix however that’s gonna happen when you have 40-60 boats jigging any one area.  The most productive baits the past 2 weekends in the Ranger were the Reefers as well as the Rapala diving Husky Jerks on long lines as well as divers trolling slow, like 1.4-1.6mph.  Our biggest so far has been 11#.  Here’s a bunch of shots from the past 2 outings –      My buddy Tim in his new Ranger 620                                                                              Good fishing!   Cheers G."
