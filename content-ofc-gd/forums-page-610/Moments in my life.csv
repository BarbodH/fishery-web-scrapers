520870,Marc Thorpe,2010-11-17 11:08:00,621,"Tks  Wayne the Fitting song for that moment is ""Basket Case"" by Green Day  Darren ,for some of us ,we still get to experience those memories,for others its no longer physically possible. In hopes those not able, enjoyed the ""moments"" captured through the lens and shared go far beyond any fish  Joey the most fitting line "" The screaming filled my head all day""  Many songs are fitting for the moment and others tell the story of those moments  The fish like many will be forgotten ,but the memories will be engraved in Time  Tks glad you enjoyed"
520976,Tom McCutcheon,2010-11-17 18:19:00,627,"That is one memory that is truly etched in my brain. Three days with Marc was an unforgetable experience.  You have what every Muskie Nut could only dream about Marc and you do it so well.  Do you know how many ""special coloured"" bucktails I have made since then? None of them have accomplished the same thing as that day.  Be well my friend.  Tom."
