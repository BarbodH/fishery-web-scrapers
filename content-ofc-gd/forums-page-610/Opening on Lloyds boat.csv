521735,Carp,2010-11-20 13:34:00,1488,"2 of my kids play hockey on the weekends. If it wasn't for that, I'd scoop this spot in a flash.  Now that I think of it, they both have games this afternoon and practices tonight, so Sunday................... Might be able to get a day trip in with our own boat. Hmmm !!!  Better work on the kitchen renovations today before the games or she's gonna blow a gasket if I take off. We're hosting Christmas dinner with her side."

521218,irishfield,2010-11-18 17:15:00,26272, I gave it to Terry so he could attend perfect view...
521219,irishfield,2010-11-18 17:16:00,26272,Hey someone grab it... shared room at the picton Harbour and an easy walk to Lloyd's boat for 6am.  ..and so the person that JUMPS UP and grabs this knows the routine...  Up at 5 / 5:15.. off to Timmies for breakfast and the 24 hour grocery store for pre-made lunch.. to boat for a 6 am departure. We go out for supper. Saturday night will be JJ's steak house. We just found over the years making your own food is not economical or productive to fishing time!
521234,johnnyb,2010-11-18 18:00:00,3413,Ohhhh this is painful.  Sorry you can't go Wayne....but even MORE sorry that I can't!     Hope somebody jumps on what is sure to be a golden opportunity.

521384,irishfield,2010-11-19 01:56:00,26272,"It really is Frankie... room is BOOKED.. boat is FULLY EQUIPPED. . you need nothing but your fishing licence and wallet to pay  your share of the room, a bit of boat gas and your food.. as this isn't a charter. It was a bunch of friends going fishing for the last weekend before the boat gets towed home. I usually do that.. but Terry's little Dodge is gonna try it this round..."

Have been on his boat three times this year, so I pretty much know the routine ""off by heart"". Sorry, that you have to miss it, and hope all goes well with your daughter!! I'm a bit frustrated that I can't swing it, but, surely not nearly as much as you are!!!"
521399,GBW,2010-11-19 03:00:00,8460,"if I wasn't going to p-vue with the others, HELL I'de be all over it!"
