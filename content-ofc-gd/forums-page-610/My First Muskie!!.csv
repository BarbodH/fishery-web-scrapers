520582,brandon,2010-11-16 20:10:00,857,"I know a lot of you guys keep bugging me about only posting photography reports and never fishing reports....well today, I went fishing.  A guy by the name of Jon Bondy lives in my apartment building, and if any of you fish the Detroit River or St. Clair, chances are you've heard of his bait...The Bondy Bait.  Anyways Jon Invited me out for some Muskie fishing this morning on the river.  I've never fished for muskie before and the only one I've ever caught was about 18"" long while Bass fishing...so it doesn't really count.  Jon fishes the river almost daily so I was quite confident he could put me on a fish.  We were on the water at 630 and it was a very slow start...in fact so slow, that this fish was caught on our LAST pass before heading in around 1230pm.  Alright enough typing, here's the pic...oh and I don't want to get in trouble for posting links but if you guys are interested in fishing with Jon or checking out his bait, feel free to google....  48"" November Muskie   November Muskie! by bbroderick86, on Flickr"

520972,mpt,2010-11-17 18:11:00,158,Great fish. You didn't describe the hit. Usually with the bondy bait the hits are violent.
520982,brandon,2010-11-17 18:34:00,857,Unfortunately I didn't get to experience one of the violent hits that often occurs with the Bondy Bait.  In my case the line just went slack on the drop...and man what a feeling setting the hook into such a fish!!
