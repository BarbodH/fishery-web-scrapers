520553,Familyfisherman,2010-11-16 19:20:00,188,"I've been out 4 times now for smallies on Simcoe...previously I'd heard how great the fall fishing was, but the few attempts I made were less then successful.  Actually, we'd caught more incidental trout then bass!  As I posted previously Mark Kulik provided us with some new baits he's made, and a few tips on how to fish them...armed with this one and only strategy we've managed to improve our results greatly!  I've taken 6 people out in 4 trips, and each person has set a PB -- so it's been a lot of fun for us!  Here's some pics of the last few outings...we were out today and had 8 fish, 3 over 5lbs, but no real brutes...but it was a very nice morning to be out.  Good luck! My first fish...5.2lbs   Cory's best, 5lbs10ozs   This one was tagged -- we caught 2 tagged bass   Dave's Best...just around 5lbs   I'll add a few more on another post..."
520559,Familyfisherman,2010-11-16 19:24:00,188,Here's a few more...  Josh's best so far...just over 4lbs   Nice fat fish   One from this morning   Even caught a rod   It's been great -- hope we get out a few more times weather-permitting!  Thanks Mark Kulik for all your help! Kevin
