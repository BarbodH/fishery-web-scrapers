I am just curious if its best to use the skeen in the rivers or bottom fishing the mouth of the river. thanks  here is a pic of the one I kept  "

521630,solopaddler,2010-11-19 23:21:00,8605,"IMO opinion skein is far superior scraped, dried and tied into bags than loose mature roe...anytime of the year. Softer with more scent = more fish.  Tie it up and use it now in the rivers.  As far as the rainbow skein being too immature to use this time of year, it really depends on the fish.  Many of the seemingly stocked domestic strain fish I've been catching recently are full of very mature beautiful skeined eggs.  I've been fishing this roe tied up the last few trips and have literally destroyed fish with it."
