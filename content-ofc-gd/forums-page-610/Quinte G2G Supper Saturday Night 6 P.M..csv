520808,Joey,2010-11-17 02:47:00,9122,"Need a head count to make reservations for Saturday night in Picton.  JJ's Texas Grill, 105 Main Street BLOOMFIELD, ON K0K 1G0 Phone: 613-393-1727 and boy do they know how to cook a steak.  Also has a big screen TV if there's any sports on.  You's guys over at Perfect Vu could probably pony up a few bucks and share a minivan taxi if you're worried about driving.  Just a thought.  So who's coming?  Were already at 8 from the other thread so add a number if you're coming or might come if a DD or Taxi can take you.  Somebody needs to take this dang trophy from cluttering up our den"

520995,Pikeslayer,2010-11-17 19:23:00,1443," I'm fishing with a group out of West Lake Willows (of whom I have never met any   ) this weekend. It looks like JJ's is not far from there so I wouldn't mind trying to meet up to shake some hands and put some faces to names. It would be post dinner though.  Regards, Pikeslayer"
