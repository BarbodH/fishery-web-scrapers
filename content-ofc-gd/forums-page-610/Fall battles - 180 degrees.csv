519775,buckster,2010-11-14 02:10:00,530,Stay positive Mike!   Sometimes the best therapy can be done on the riverbank if you're still feeling upto it
520505,MJL,2010-11-16 17:03:00,2427,"Cheers guys.  After visiting various clinics for ultrasounds, blood work, X-rays, etc, I will be going in for surgery on Thursday.  Doesn't sound fun by any means - especially after looking at various diagrams - but the only choice my urologist gave me were stitches or staples.LOL  On the bright side, I plan to spoil myself with a new underwater case for my DSLR and may order a slightly bigger version of the centrepin I already have but really do love - In stealth fighter black of course  Thanks again guys for your support.  The last few days have been way better for me mentally    Physically, the doctors and lab techs are impressed with my fitness levels and are optimistic about my recovery...Steelheading and bushwhacking trout streams will do that for you   I can't wait Mike!"
520509,bigfish1965,2010-11-16 17:08:00,3382," Good luck MJ. Keep your humour high...ask the nurse to see 'If this looks swollen"" to her..that one kept me occupied for the duration"

520725,bassnass,2010-11-17 00:18:00,174,Dude!  What DSLR do you shoot?!  I didn't know you could get UW cases for the big cams...I may pee a lil!  Stiches - they look cool and any med. prof. you know can pull em out.
520768,MJL,2010-11-17 01:23:00,2427," I have a canon 40D.  The UW case I plan to get is more like a glorified zip-lock baggie with a lens port (EWA Marine).  For $260 It's way cheaper than the replacement cost should I dunk the camera...I tend to destroy cameras while steelheading...At least 1 or 2 per year  Alternatively, I could save up for a professional polycarbonate one with full controls...but I'd rather spend that kinda coin on some new fishing tackle"
521528,Sinker,2010-11-19 18:39:00,8692,"Mike,  I haven't been online for a while, and just read this now. I have goosebumps all over. I can only assume your doing well, and on the road to recovery. If you need anything, just say the word. I'll be looking forward to chatting with you soon!!!  Take care bud, and keep your chin up. You'll have this whipped in no time!  S."

519350,MJL,2010-11-12 03:30:00,2427,"Thanks again guys for the incredible support you’ve given me - I truly can't express my gratitude towards the whole OFC community.  I spent the last couple hours replying to all the PM’s I could and will continue to do so for as long as they come – I’ve even been informed that one angling crush of mine (and many) has read this thread  I sneaked a few quick looks at the ultrasound pics but as someone who hadn’t taken biology beyond the twelfth grade, one fuzzy blob looked exactly like the next fuzzy blob.  I’ll have to continue my wait for a diagnosis   It involves the careful and deliberate attempt to manipulate rod angles (while fighting strong, powerful, or out of control fish) so that hooked fish will mysteriously (and magically) swim right to the rod tip...So that you can pounce on them...Especially if it’s a fish worthy of a hero shot"

However, you sound like you have a good support network. Don't hesitate to lean on them (or us). Also want to reassure you that if you do have the surgery...No difference afterward Sending Good Karma waves you way! Jewelbee"

519079,MJL,2010-11-11 03:43:00,2427,"I haven’t been fishing much this fall – Probably only 7 or so trips from the beginning of October.  Despite the lower than normal water conditions, the fishing for the most part has been great with some nice fish coming out.          Been fishing a fair bit with Frozen Fire...He lives down the street from me and fishes daily anyway    After a year of pretty intensive research, and a lifetime of reading about it in books, I finally made the pilgrimage on the weekend to one special steelhead river I still had yet to fish – Frozen Fire would be my partner in crime for our maiden voyage.  Large in both length and width (compared to most other rivers I regularly fish), I was pretty jazzed and blown away by the scenery. We treated it like a scouting trip and trekked through as much territory as we could humanly possible and drove the backroads, highways and concessions we could find to safely reach the river.  Didn’t start out so good though.  The first hour was spent playing fetch with a lost German Shorthair Pointer who adopted us as playmates and followed us around – By fetch, she tried to retrieve our drifting floats as they went down river.  High energy is an understatement.  She just wouldn’t quit!    With so much prime looking water, it certainly was a little tougher river to read but insanely fun to fish – I can’t remember the last time I was as excited to go fishing. We didn’t get into any large fish but we did manage to pull out some hard fighting, wild, chrome fish from the various pools and logjams.  They were still a bit of a handful even with the down & dirty technique          I have to give many special thanks to Buckster, Solopaddler, and Wallacio for their wonderful words of wisdom they gave me prior to the trip .  They certainly boosted our confidence and we both managed to land some fish.   ~   The below text may not be as easy for some to read compared to the above - Especially for my closer partners in crime on the water to whom I consider as much a part of my family...On a personal note, it wasn't as easy for me to write compared to the poetry and DIY washing machine manuals I've written in the past.  I may be hanging up the steelhead kit for the next little while.  From the looks of it, I may be battling another adversary shortly where my knowledge of rivers, drifting floats, tossing spinners, steelhead, and the down & dirty technique may not come in as handy.  After visiting a couple of doctors/specialists the last few days, and being poked & prodded a number of times in some uncomfortable places, there’s a more than probable chance that I will be battling testicular cancer (Not 100% sure yet).  How aggressive or whether it has already spread in some way, shape or form, I don’t know yet either but it's pretty nerve racking thinking about it.  The doctors seem to be quite concerned about the case.  I go for an ultrasound tomorrow.  I promised a few people on the board that I’d hook up with them this fall for steelhead (to big, distant rivers as well as to a few smaller local ditches...possibly with the prospect of a burger afterwards) but that may have to wait for a bit depending on the results of the ultrasound tomorrow.  I'm currently finding solace in my loving family, close friends, listening to my Mozart MP3s and spinning a couple of my centrepin reels around in front of the computer while surfing OFC.  I'm not usually one to ask for anything that I couldn't find or get myself first, but if you can spare a bit of Luck and Karma and send it my way, I’d greatly appreciate it.   Many thanks in advance  Mike"
519082,mercman,2010-11-11 03:53:00,7054,Be positive bud.Speedy recovery and i pray those docs are wrong.Keep us updated and i will ask my higher power to see if he can pull some strings for ya   Paul

I am glad you posted this. More guys and parents need to be aware of the high incidence of this disease amongst young men.  I am crossing my fingers that it is just a hydrocele!! If not, we are here and we will support you..and probably make fun of you when we can Call me if you need anything!  Rick, Uniballer since 1998."

Perhaps it was a sign of good things to come and a message to tell you that everything will be just fine.  The community will stay strong for you Mike.  It's relieving to hear such reassuring words from people like Rick, who has been down the same path."

As many have said and will say, stay positive and do not hesitate to lean on family and friends when needed.

There isn’t much I can eloquently write without getting somewhat teary eyed.  The good Lord blessed me with a pretty sick and terrible sense of humor and that seems to be getting me and my family through things.  As I've told a few others, I first logged into OFC back in 2005 and can't think of another community I'd rather be a part of - I came for the tips but stayed for the people.  I'll let you guys know how it goes   Walleye have always been my arch nemesis...If you catch one, can I touch it?  Thanks Carole    Being the gentleman that I am, it would only be proper after the first or second date    (j/k)  Thanks Wayne for the kind words and thoughts and hope all goes well with Jen.   Absolutely...No question about it  Thanks again guys.  I really appreciate all the support that you've given me.  Cheers & Smiles  Mike"
519188,fishnsled,2010-11-11 16:40:00,3520,Great report and pics Mike. Almost makes me want to hit the rivers again. Now that the boat is on the D.L. list I may have to make a point of it.  A few of years ago I was also poked and prodded in places most likely similar to what you have been through. My outcome was good and I only have a yearly check up on the prostate and a PSA test at this point in time. It can be hell going through the waiting but be strong and positive. Not easily done but it sounds like you have a great support group. You'll be in my thoughts and prayers along with a few others. Here's hoping for good news!
519200,highdrifter,2010-11-11 17:48:00,2534,Nice chromeage bud!!  Tough breaks about your possible cancer..  I hope the results are negative and wish you all the best.  I'm confident that your die hard steelheading life style will keep you strong and healthy.  cheers HD
