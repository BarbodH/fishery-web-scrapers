520742,strik,2010-11-17 00:44:00,175,Hello All  Just want to say great site  lots of info  and seems like a lot of great people....  Im in the market for a new fishfinder moslty just do downrigging. I was looking at the bird 788ci or lowrance hds 5  then seen the lowrance elite 5. Anyone have a unit they would recomend for downrigging im just not sure the down/side imingine is even a factor for me i can see why one would like it for other types of fishing but for downrigging not sure it matters. I fish mostly lake huron and georgian bay thanks all

I usually have 70% of the screen for the gps and the rest with the sonar. The upgrade of the lss-1 unit is so sensative it will pick up the rope of my anchor.  Art
