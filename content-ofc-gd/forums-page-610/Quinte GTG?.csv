518326,GBW,2010-11-08 03:09:00,8460,Well I hope you can make it Wayne.  Seen enough pic's of your mug and read enough reports to feel that I know you.  I know times are not well so you do what you need to do and we can shake hands another time then if we must wait.
518327,irishfield,2010-11-08 03:12:00,26272,"Won't know until late Wednesday night if I'll be heading to Lloyd's Thursday. Jen's Chemo is Monday/Tuesday and we'll see how the first one goes. Lexxington is ""batter up"" for my spot and a welcomed extra if I indeed make it down."
518334,GBW,2010-11-08 03:56:00,8460,You do what you need to do Wayne.  The fish will be there for years to come...

We can all take the grand toal and split it at the end so it's equal for everyone?  Just an idea...  Randy, get Wayne to fly you down if he is going to make the trip."

There is a fire pit between our cabin's as well as a fire pit down by the docks.  In total for the two cabin's we are looking at $791.00 (after taxes) / x # of people from the 19th to 21st.  We are all set and so are you.  Again, Gerrit, Bitsmith, HH and fishnsled; are we good with that change?   Randy, we have room left for one more if you want to make the long treck."

517403,Headhunter,2010-11-04 15:18:00,5703,That's probably a fair assumtion Lew... now I know why may hair stands up every time I hear that name... HH

We have some guides with expereince on here we can hire, plus we can use my old contacts from the states and hit the US show circut.  We can have seasonal OFC GTG's aswell.  We can do it right.  I am half joking...."
517408,Joey,2010-11-04 15:35:00,9122," That's just awful Lew.  I booked mine, they ASKED for my credit card number and then they sent me a confirmation email stating the date and cottage booked.  Don't know who this moron is who is giving others a hard time, but I'll definately have a word with Jennifer and Kevin.  Not like it will matter anyhow, but something should be said.  Joey"
517411,lew,2010-11-04 15:52:00,12766,"We book motels a couple times a year and they nearly always ask for a card #, infact I'm booked into a motel in Chatham this weekend and just gave my # this morning.  That's why I was surprised when the guy at Merlands said he didn't require my # and I even  told my wife about it.  Oh well, it'll be the last time I ever offer to give my $$$$ to those folks, I'm sure some other resort would appreciate it more."

As for the boat being fixed, Should be ready in the Spring. One disabled boat is not top of the list when you have dozens to winterize. One upset guy or an angry mob?    You can have all the tools but if you don't know how to use them, what good are they?    It might have been open water in the Kawarthas? You might be thinking of Ken. Was I hungover? Must be an age thing.    Sorry to hear that you and Phil cannot make the trip. More sorry that Merlands just about ruined your weekend.  UNREAL!!!!!!"
517470,bassnass,2010-11-04 19:59:00,174,"Yes!  Open Water Kawarthas!  And Ken! And fish whistles!  Holy shniekies - I remember that hangover - but if I've got the opportunity, I'm not passin' up on fishin'!!  Yep - rip jigged for eyes, floated for crappies...I believe it was Balsam?  Dunno.  Doesn't matter.  IT'S QUINTE, NOW!  - Like hearing about Merland Parks' disorganization - good to avoid places like that.  Imagine showin' up and being told ""Who are you?""  *queit little twig snaps*  It's called a computer folks.  Get one.  Sorry to hear about someone visiting sick kids - hopefully none too serious.  Whatever the case - they're the best in the world!"
517472,bassnass,2010-11-04 20:01:00,174,"Grasshopper - ha!  I read the emails, not the posts - so much lost in translations!  I thought grasshopper was referring to learning to avoid Merland! lol"
517476,bassnass,2010-11-04 20:09:00,174,And PS!  I could teach you a thing or two about using 'tool'...but i'm afraid you'd take me up on the offer!!  (Damn...I need to read everything!)
517482,LeXXington,2010-11-04 20:30:00,1928,"OK, looks like I am all set for the 19th weekend. See everyone there  thanks  Lexx"
517502,GBW,2010-11-04 21:49:00,8460,"LincolnG, are you coming with us then?  If so, we need to figure out the boat situation and we will need to move to the bigger cabin (if we can)"
517505,irishfield,2010-11-04 21:53:00,26272,"Sorry to hear you are off to Sick Kids Phil.. been there done that, but they are GREAT people and will take the bestest care of your little sweetie. Good chance I'll be across the street at Mount Sinai with one of our little sweeties, now 25, at the same time and if so maybe we need to do lunch or supper.  Lexx, great that you'll be aboard the U and Me express fishing machine with the motley crew. I hope that I'm there as well to enjoy a much needed weekend.. but we'll see where we are at come Thursday the 18th."
517508,bassnass,2010-11-04 22:04:00,174,"Well - I think, as of right now, I've filled a spot in my buddy's boat - comin down Next weekend and the week after...week after being the GTG, if I'm I've not had TMR.  We were thinkin' about squatting at a no-tell motel, but the cabin thing would be way better - cause we could whistle and drink with y'all.  (Prol. more drinkin'...).  But there would be three of us.  Don't know how that would work and don't wanna be a PITA.  But would DEF. like to get in on the comradarie.  So, if three of us could be accomodated, I think that would be AWESOME.  I'm not fussy...I can pass out drunk anywhere!  There other two guys (one older in spirit, one just older) are good dudes - father/son in law team - they'd prolly want a bed.  So...thoughts??"
517510,Muskieman,2010-11-04 22:11:00,2472,I am so willing to go ... are there any OFC Northerners that are going ? I'll split on gas and lodging... or we can take my stuff and vice versa....

Seems a bunch were willing to give them a second chance.... perhaps it is only the odd person that gets the gears???.. some did not believe us about our experiance.. perhaps more do now.  Wish I could have shaken you're hand again...  and whatever the issue is.. I hope it is not too serious!  G

And drink has been known to erase memory.  Did I take a butt-load of pix and vidy (my motto: ""Capture the moment.  All of them.""), cuz that would have been me.  Was I unbelievably handsome?  Cuz that wouldn't have been me.  Either way...I'll remember the next time.  Because the next time, *ALL* of us are going to pull PB's outta that bay!  Dammit!  We'll talk Sunday about stuff'n'things!  I'm 'kid-in-a-topless-candy-store' excited!"
517388,Headhunter,2010-11-04 14:08:00,5703,"We picked you up in Will's truck, you were some what ""over served"" the previous night and passed out in the back of Will's truck, until we got to Simcoe... then you fished like a trooper all day! Let me know when you find a topless candy store, that would peak my interest! HH"
517393,lew,2010-11-04 14:39:00,12766,"Myself and Harrison had cabin 7 booked at Merland Park for the November G2G but somethings come up and we have to cancel, unfortunately.  Probably a good thing though cause I just called Merland Park to cancel our reservation for cabin 7 only to be told that I must be mistaken because it's already booked to ANOTHER party and they have no record of me ever calling.........UN-BELIEVABLE !!!!  I told her the reservation was made back in September and when I offered the guy my credit card number over the phone he told me they don't take card numbers but not to worry cause he marked me in the reservation book himself and I was all set.  If your booked at Merlands, ya better check.  They received some really bad OFC reviews a couple years ago for this very same crap but it would appear as if nothing has improved there at all."

508147,superdad,2010-09-30 12:30:00,353,"As Grateful Fisherman said, that's the weekend for Quintefishing G2G.  ""this year we will have the get together at Perfect Vue cottages with hosts Joanne and Larry. The date will be Friday November 19th-Sunday November 21st. In addition Sheldon Hatch aka Eye Tracker will join us Saturday evening at the Perfect Vue Rec centre, with computer, overhead and slide projector in hand, to give us a seminar on fall walleye trolling tactics. Its going to be a great weekend""  It's also the Santa Claus parade in TO and my grandsons birthday - guess where I will be??????"
508148,tknohpy,2010-09-30 12:37:00,162,Hopefully fishing Superdad  I would be happy with spending my Birthday out on the boat with my grandpa
508152,Headhunter,2010-09-30 13:20:00,5703,"Well Brian, I would say based on my experience of yesterday, they are not off to a good start! I followed up with them this morning, trying to understand how I was refused a cottage, only to find out that both Joey and Lew were able to book, when I was refused hours earlier... After much appologizing for the ""mix up"" I'm still left scratching my head.  So, we will have yet another dis-funtional GTG as again this year, we will not be together as a group. HH I hope the Quinte Fishing board group like beer!"
508153,Harrison,2010-09-30 13:27:00,2202, I bet they saw your shirt.  We aren't to far from each other bud.
508161,Headhunter,2010-09-30 13:50:00,5703,"Well, your at least partially right Phil, we really aren't that far, but we certainly are far enough away based on the volumes of BEER that are going to be consumed and knowing the group I'll be with, no one is going to volunteer to be the DD! RE the shirt... as a wise mod once said to me... ""You know joe, not everyone could get away with wearing a shirt like that"" HH"
508177,lew,2010-09-30 14:41:00,12766,"Hey Joe, I wonder if you and I were even talking to the same guy yesterday. When I called in the afternoon there was no hesitation at all when he said they had one small cabin and 2 motel units still available."
508179,Headhunter,2010-09-30 14:50:00,5703,"I don't know Lew... all I can say is what was said to me. I was not asked how many people I needed a cottage for...I was told in no uncertain terms that there were no cottages available for that weekend... and I called at around 11:00am, yesterday.  I'm wondering if there may be a ""non drinker"" who wouldn't mind picking up some drunken fools and driving us to Merlands so we can at least get some time together as a group... but I suspect that there aren't that many fools around! HH"
508185,Spiel,2010-09-30 15:12:00,9065,"  LOL....I've been called a lot of things Joe but ""wise"" is a new one for me.....  But I do stand firmly behind the quoted comment....."
508188,Headhunter,2010-09-30 15:28:00,5703, HH
508193,Joey,2010-09-30 15:49:00,9122," If it is not too far, I might be inclined to do that, being a non-drinker, especially just picking up, but if its too late dropping off, maybe a taxi would work?  Just don't call me a fool"
508199,Headhunter,2010-09-30 15:54:00,5703,"You're too kind Joey! And no, I wouldn't call you a fool! At least not until we get dropped off back at Perfect Vue! Just a joke folks, just a joke! HH"
508471,fishhunter,2010-10-01 11:08:00,604,"WELL LOOKS LIKE IM IN AGAIN. GOT MY TEAM TOGETHER. WAYNE, DAN AND MYSELF THINK I MAY ASK THAT TERRY GUY LOL WE ARE IN FOR FRI SAT SUN. JOE CALL ME TONIGHT ON MY CELL ILL BE ON MY BOAT IN PICTON"

507793,GBW,2010-09-28 23:36:00,8460,let's just say lot's of people and they all drink a lot.  it's more of the gathering then the fishing for some.  FYI this is my 1st year (if I can make it).
507816,Roy,2010-09-29 00:25:00,13728,"So who else wants to join in the fun? There's still a bit of time to get your acts together but reservations will need to be made. Boat spots should be available for everyone. Cold and wind are usually there as well at that time of the year so warm, waterproof clothing are important. Floatsuits are almost indispensable. Let's hear your plans."
507824,Daplumma,2010-09-29 00:41:00,1961,"There is a chance of this happeneing for me.Where are people staying,not much of a camper in November in Canada.Will prolly need a spot in a boat or I could bring a boat but will need someone to guide me to those monster walleyes. Joe"
507831,GBW,2010-09-29 01:04:00,8460,"Joe, I think the plan this year is Merland Park and it's a cabin, not a tent   I could be wrongm on the location though...  As for the boat, I'm sure there are many folks here that can help you find the spots if you did bring your boat."
507835,Roy,2010-09-29 01:11:00,13728," Dang, Joe! If you could make it, it would make the whole GTG much more worthwhile for everyone! Give me some news!"
507836,Joey,2010-09-29 01:15:00,9122,"Well if us newlyweds can drag ourselves from the bedroom long enough, we'll probably go  Joey"
507843,GBW,2010-09-29 01:34:00,8460,"What place has the fire pit?  I think it's going to be needed as there are so mane new folks (like me) who want to go.  Where's the best place to sit and chat (other then in a boat) with new 'friends'?  A FIRE...  After all, we need a few garbage can's with ice for all the keg's thatleetboy is going to bring so we need some space outside by a fire...  PS, so far I'm in as I checked with the Mrs and as far as we know there is no family functions that weekend."
507844,GBW,2010-09-29 01:36:00,8460,"OR, can we make a fire pit? As far as I'm concerned my bed is a place for a few hours and the rest of the time is for fishing and fun.  I don't care where we go.  Fishing + OFC folks + Beer + fire = a hell of a good time in my mind..."
507848,Joey,2010-09-29 01:49:00,9122, Merland Park in Picton.
507851,GBW,2010-09-29 01:57:00,8460,"Thanks Joey, now get back to the newlywed thing would ya..."
507852,Roy,2010-09-29 02:05:00,13728,Here's the link to Merland Park. http://www.merlandpark.com/
507888,GBW,2010-09-29 12:50:00,8460,What about Perfect Vue Resort?
507889,Bitsmith2k,2010-09-29 12:51:00,396," i could be wrong, but you possibly sold me a couple kegs late last winter/early spring, that have been awesome brew keggles for me.."
507899,thatleetboy,2010-09-29 13:33:00,143, Might have been me. I do remember selling a pair to a guy who said he was really into fishing!
507948,Headhunter,2010-09-29 17:19:00,5703,"I called Merlands this morning, they say they are booked solid for the weekend of the 19th, 20th and 21st. NO COTTAGES AVAILABLE!!!! I have booked myself and Bitsmith into Perfect Vue for those dates. I believe that they have more cottages available... they can be reached at 613 354 3001. FishnSled, my cottage sleeps four, should you be able to get away! HH"
507950,GBW,2010-09-29 17:22:00,8460,I'm in too.
507965,Joey,2010-09-29 19:34:00,9122,Just talked to Merland and booked there.  They still have 1 cabin and 2 motel rooms.
507966,Headhunter,2010-09-29 19:39:00,5703,"Well Joey, you must have more magic than me, cause I called at around 11:00am today. A gentleman answered the phone and practically laughed at me when I inquired as to cottages available for the weekend of Nov. 19, 20 and 21st. Hmmmm... don't really know what to think of this?! HH"
507967,Roy,2010-09-29 19:40:00,13728,"hahahahaha I love it when a ""guestimate"" happens. We get the fire pit again."
507969,Joey,2010-09-29 19:54:00,9122, I think it is the size of the cabins Joe.  You are probably looking for one with a bedroom or two?
507973,Roy,2010-09-29 20:26:00,13728," I'm quite sure that's what it is as well, Joey."
507974,Terry,2010-09-29 20:30:00,14456, so you are saying size matters..?....    LOL
507986,GBW,2010-09-29 21:44:00,8460,"Nope, I was sitting beside him when he was told ""no space, we are booked solid for that weekend"""
507991,fish_fishburn,2010-09-29 22:20:00,1311,"Well that really sucks. I am booked there for 24,25,26, would of been grreat to be able to meet everyone. Do me a big favour and don't burn down Mikey Bigfish cabin because that is where I am staying."
507993,lew,2010-09-29 22:27:00,12766,Harrison and I are now booked into cabin 7 at Merlands for the 19th & 20th and there's still 2 motel rooms left.  As of 2 hours ago anyways.
507699,Headhunter,2010-09-28 16:38:00,5703,"Hey guys, I am trying to get my life organized and in doing so, I have to start to book the time for the GTG. I know that there has been a bunch of stuff said and what not, but let's cut to the chase here... is it happening and if so, when? At this point I don't really care if we are in the same place or not, it seems that we are hard pressed as a group to agree on much. Is it possible to at least agree upon a date? Man, it seems like we are trying to heard cats here! HH"
507714,GBW,2010-09-28 18:23:00,8460,"Ok, what's going on with this as I was thinking of trying to make it this year.  Even more so if I need to take a day off work.  Something tells me calling in sick isn't an option..."
507719,fishnsled,2010-09-28 18:48:00,3520,It seems that in the past it has been the second weekend in November which would be the 13th & 14th this year.  I have confirmed that I will be down there the weekend before but could easily pop in the following weekend as well for a visit.
507721,Headhunter,2010-09-28 18:52:00,5703,"Well, thanks to the both of you for replying... however, given that I have spoken to BOTH OF YOU TODAY, your insight into the weekend is well, moot! Anyone else care to toss their two cents in? HH"
507725,misfish,2010-09-28 19:08:00,29133,"Im waiting to hear back from Terry.But he,s waiting to hear from someone else,whom is waiting to hear from another guy.Thats where it stand now for me."
507729,Roy,2010-09-28 19:21:00,13728,My best guestimate would be the weekend of the 20th at Merland Park. But that's just a guess.
507732,Harrison,2010-09-28 19:39:00,2202,I could possibly swing the 20th weekend if someone has room for a guide who is currently boatless but I could find the right ride by then.
507734,lew,2010-09-28 19:44:00,12766,"Hey Phil, I think I'm gonna go this year and your more than welcome in my boat."
507738,Harrison,2010-09-28 19:55:00,2202,"Ok, I am in.  Thanks Lew.  Maybe this year we can have a few more of the original BOQ MTGers show up!  Actually I'd like the see JP, Diplip, Lipdip, dipnsip, other whatever show up too.  I'll BBQ though."
507742,Roy,2010-09-28 20:13:00,13728,"See what a gentle, guiding hand can do?"
507750,Ron,2010-09-28 20:38:00,1683,The weekend of the 20th works for me. The weekend before is closer on the Kawarthas for walleye and I wouldn't miss that for the world.
507751,HTHM,2010-09-28 20:59:00,4082,I'm in.
507752,Roy,2010-09-28 21:02:00,13728,"This here's the rubber ducky.....mercy sakes alive, looks like we got us a convoy!"
507754,thatleetboy,2010-09-28 21:07:00,143,"Can anyone join in on this?  Or is it one of those ""gold membership"" things ?    I'm a noob, just wondering what the deal is...  Anyhow, I don't have a boat, but I make my own beer, and it's pretty darn good!   Cheers"
507761,misfish,2010-09-28 21:38:00,29133, Ya better have lots.
507762,Terry,2010-09-28 21:41:00,14456,anyone can join in  looks like the 20th and looks like most will be staying at Merland Park  I have no idea what my plans are but I will be on the BOQ that weekend
507765,GBW,2010-09-28 21:48:00,8460,"the 20th?  I have to check...  to the poster about beer.  do you do keg's?  you're going to need a few...okay, maybe a dozen...  *edit* I won't have a boat either so I would need a spot too."
507767,lew,2010-09-28 21:56:00,12766,The 20th is a Saturday  so I'm assuming we'll all be heading down on the 19th ??
507770,oldphart,2010-09-28 22:14:00,665,"~~~Yep it's that time of year again,put me down for a maybe, need to talk to a couple of guys"
507772,Roy,2010-09-28 22:25:00,13728," Yeah it would be the 19th Lew but I'm sure that some folks could only get there early on the Saturday. But hey...EVERYDAY is Saturday for you, Bud!"
507774,lew,2010-09-28 22:29:00,12766, You got that right my friend
507777,misfish,2010-09-28 22:49:00,29133,"    Ok,thats enough of that trash talk."
507784,thatleetboy,2010-09-28 23:17:00,143," Yeah, I keg my beer, and my brew kettle is 130 litres. Don't ask... We all get carried away with our hobbies!  Sooo.... how many guys will show up for the BOQ GTG?"
507786,HTHM,2010-09-28 23:21:00,4082,"I have many times been called something that rymes with duck, but never a rubber duck. I am not sure how to deal with that......"
507787,HTHM,2010-09-28 23:22:00,4082,Now that we know there is free beer....everyone!
