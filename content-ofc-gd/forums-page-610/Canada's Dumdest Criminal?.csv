521244,Garry2Rs,2010-11-18 18:54:00,1425,Here's my vote for Canada's Dumdest Criminal...
521264,skeeter,2010-11-18 20:09:00,1907,"i think they should charge him.  armed robbery trespassing possession of a dangerous weapon and attempted murder that might make further idiots think once, cause we know they can't think twice!"
521267,fishing n autograph,2010-11-18 20:29:00,2540," Charges would most likely be armed robbery, weapons dangerous, and it would be a stretch but assault with a weapon. Trespassing is a provincial charge that really is only a $65 ticket that carries no real weight....  And if experience has taught me anything...there are no smart criminals"
521269,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-11-18 20:45:00,0," and accountans/book keepers,lawyers and politicans(who are lawyers), ect.....The smart ones are the ones who know the laws inside out and the loop holes.  The funniest comment was ""I cant wait until he successfully sues"". Can you imagine he sues for getting injured on the property? I've heard worse things and they won...."
521279,irishfield,2010-11-18 21:30:00,26272," You might want to look into that a little harder Dave... wanna see my cancelled cheques to a lawyer for almost $7k, to defend against said charge brought about by a psychotic neighbour that convinced the OPP to lay said charge against me in 1994 when I'd never even stepped foot on their property??"
521285,fishing n autograph,2010-11-18 21:47:00,2540,"Wow, that's news to me because the TPA charge for trespassing is $65 and carries the same weight as speeding. Might have changed because there no criminal charge for trespassing....but then again that was 1994 and things might have changed"
521288,fishing n autograph,2010-11-18 21:48:00,2540,Could have been trespass by night which is prowling under the criminal code
521293,Rod Caster,2010-11-18 21:56:00,5784,My vote goes to someone that rhymes with Malton McMinty.
521327,Dave Bailey,2010-11-18 23:53:00,1641," If I recall correctly there is a charge called 'Criminal Trespass', which probably treats a different class of crime and carries a stiffer penalty. But I'm no lawyer..."
521339,fishing n autograph,2010-11-19 00:15:00,2540,"No, I double checked the criminal code just to be sure... There's what's called trespass or prowl by night but as for trespassing that's it. There is also criminal harassment and a section of mischief that is close to trespassing but the true definition of trespassing which we all know, being on a property without permission etc is a provincial offence"
521341,fishing n autograph,2010-11-19 00:16:00,2540,"But things do change, I've read reports from 10-15 yrs ago where the charges laid don't exist anymore or the title and wording has changed"
521373,John Bacon,2010-11-19 01:31:00,3277, You only talk to the stupid one; the ones you don't catch are the smart ones
521375,John Bacon,2010-11-19 01:35:00,3277, I am an accountant with bookkeeping experience what crimes have I supposedly committed?  I resent being labelled as a criminal based on my profession.
521427,NAW,2010-11-19 04:01:00,4022,  Really?  You can't take a joke?
