520879,dave524,2010-11-17 11:50:00,4508,This book and the other in the series is well spoken of:  http://www.fishusa.com/Precision-Trolling-Big-Water-2nd-Edition_p.html

520911,Pikeslayer,2010-11-17 14:32:00,1443," Got to agree with GMAN 'support those who put it together' and your local tackle shop. Most LO tackle shops carry these and I have even seen copies in BPS. They are well put together with heavy laminate (waterproof) stock and D rings. They reference all types of lines (mono, braid, leadcore, wire & copper), all divers & ball & snap weights. In '09 I was 'guessing' with my wire/diver combos and had limited success off these rigs. I bought the book earlier this year and my w/d combos were as productive as the downriggers (love the sound of wire zinging). This 'tool' is a must have on your boat. It would be a nice Christmas present. Put it on your list. You won't regret it. Regards, Pikeslayer"

521145,spincast,2010-11-18 10:23:00,3279,Vince - let me now if you want one - I have to hit that store again soon and I can pick you one up if there are any left.
