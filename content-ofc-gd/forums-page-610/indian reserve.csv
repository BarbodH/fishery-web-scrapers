521462,Canadave,2010-11-19 13:40:00,62,Take exit 566 off the 401 and go south about 2 clicks or so.  If I remember correctly it's about 30 kl east of Belleville but I could be wrong. You'll see a convenience store on the left called Confederate. There's a store on the right before you get to Confederate but I don't know what their prices are like ... probably the same.  The bags of weeds with the blue stripe were $15 about two weeks ago and $12 a couple of months before that.  Exit 566 means you're 566 Kl. from the beginning of the 401 at Windsor so whatever exit number you're at will tell you how far it is to 566.
