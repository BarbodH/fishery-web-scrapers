520905,bigbuck,2010-11-17 14:04:00,2449,"There's bass, pike and a few pickerel to be had. I have fished the area 15-20 years ago and it was decent. I can't remember how deep the lake is though."
520923,RickOnt,2010-11-17 14:54:00,669,Thanks Buck  I am assuming you are referring to summer!!!Did you do any IceFishing??  I have read of Icefishing on nearby Bernard Lake.  Rick
520928,steelhedrmatt,2010-11-17 15:27:00,278,"we used to go there every year, winter and summer.  summer fishing wasn't too bad, not very consistant. Winter was slow at best. winter pike fishing was just ok, but the pics seemed to dissapear. (or I wasnt fishing the right spot) if you go there in the winter, try off the rock face. that's where we would get most of our pike, and watch the ice near the mouth of the mag, (both sides) it's scketchy at best.  (usually open water)  Hope this helps"
520946,RickOnt,2010-11-17 16:36:00,669,"Hey Matt  I hear Ya on the ""Right Spot""  I have that problem also  LOL   How was the Pic fishing in the summer???   I see you are in Bradford  Do you IceFish on Simcoe???  Rick"
521014,Flappn,2010-11-17 20:37:00,245,Not really sure about pickeral lake but Doe Lake just up the Magnetawan from Pickeral Lake has good walleye fishing. You have to be fishing in Big Doe however.
521038,Smarty Pantz,2010-11-17 22:06:00,203,  Yes made it there myself & fishing was awesome!!!
