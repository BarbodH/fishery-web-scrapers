I know it sure was windy here today, anyone have an update on the water clarity in the upper river? I know I asked this once before a year or two ago and someone was able to post an actual live satellite picture of the river. If anyone is able to do this tomorrow some time I'd be very grateful (I'd do it myself but not sure where they found live pictures of the river.)"
521062,denisk,2010-11-17 23:53:00,163,Probally to cloudy for a good satellite shot.  THe river was starting to get dirty at the end of the day but with the winds laying down and staying somewhat lower I'd say you'll have about 3-5 vis on the upper for friday.  It's fishable for steelies but I'd be chasing muskie that's like the best conditions you could hope for.  I have a bunch of Red October baits if your chasing Esox...
521069,Rizzo,2010-11-18 00:42:00,4754,that's what I wanted to hear! I will be after musky. Was out 2 weeks ago in gin-clear water and managed one small one (35 inches?)Please excuse my ignorance but what is a red october bait?

521150,denisk,2010-11-18 11:53:00,163,Twisted tube is lights out on a niagara drift google red october baits
521193,Alumacraft,2010-11-18 16:22:00,139,Hey Dennis what the verdict on the visiblity on the upper today. Thanks Rob
521195,bassfighter,2010-11-18 16:38:00,366,"  I normally used this site for rough info on water clarity at niagara, http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/modis/region_map.html  Between lake erie and lake ontario is niagara river, if mouth of upper niagara on Lake Erie map looks stained, chances are the upper river will also be murky. however if you look at mouth of lower niagara on the lake ontario map section, and the color might not look too bad, chance are lower river is more fishable.  Sometimes the sattelite image are covered with clouds, then it is almost impossible to know what is happening on the river. Put a post at niagarafishing.net site as well, hope someone will add their input on water clarity."
