521567,MJL,2010-11-19 21:13:00,2427,"Surgery was delayed by 4hrs but it went well from what I was told by the people doing it.  No swelling with only some pain where the incision was made for now - They opted to use staples to zip me up.  Pain isn't enough to really warrant use of pain killers...I actually put myself through a lot more while doing the Navy Seal fitness program for the months prior  Frozen Fire, his girlfriend and Victor stopped by last night and dropped off a couple fishing/photography books and DVDs  Thanks a lot guys.  Really appreciate the support you've given me over the last couple weeks"
521570,The Urban Fisherman,2010-11-19 21:17:00,2050,Glad to hear it went well and that they didn't slice anything in the wrong spot buddy!

520737,hammercarp,2010-11-17 00:35:00,964,My thoughts are with you Mike and I hope for a speedy recovery.
520763,MJL,2010-11-17 01:11:00,2427,"Thanks guys...Can’t say it enough and won’t stop appreciating it all. Rick has been as close to a big brother I could ever ask for during this time, and has been guiding me through the processes (some of which will suck but that's the nature of it).  I consider OFC and all of its members part of my lifestyle, my religion and my family    I promise I won't lick my stitches...  Or my genitals   That would depend on the nurse   Definitely!  One other athlete I do admire a lot is Lance Mackey (an esophageal cancer survivor and 4 time winner of the Iditarod...Along with a few Yukon Quest victories).  I may never race 16 sled dogs across Alaska in 9 days, but his upbeat, positive and humble attitudes are what I admire the most and will probably get me through the times that really suck  Cheers & all smiles"
520783,bigfish1965,2010-11-17 02:08:00,3382,"If you get bored Mike...just remember to call over to the cutest nurse as you point to your incision.. ""Does this look swollen to you?"""
