520831,lookinforwalleye,2010-11-17 03:31:00,4399,I would think the main difference would be the inerds would be corrosion resistant.
520847,timmeh,2010-11-17 04:07:00,609," Yep, but not just the inside parts. Different materials and/or finishing to prevent the salt damage."
520907,DoubleDigits,2010-11-17 14:11:00,140," Hi there. I've had an ID here for a while, but haven't been compelled to post anything yet. As to your question, some high-end saltwater reels have a 'sealed' drag system, with a rubber washer that keeps the brine out of your gears. However, I have fished many, many hours in saltwater with gear that was only ever intended for fresh. Mind you, I was very meticulous about cleaning my gear after each use, and I used a lubricant that was saltwater repellent. I would assume that you are asking because you will be doing some fishing in the salt. If this is the case, I would just use the gear that you've got, and clean it thoroughly the same day that you use it."
520913,cwpowell,2010-11-17 14:39:00,265,"Well truth be told, I was looking on the bass pro website thinking about purchasing a new reel, or two and noticed the salt water section apart from the freshwater and saw a lot of nice reels in the saltwater section."
520924,DoubleDigits,2010-11-17 14:55:00,140," Yeah, well that would be the other difference! High quality drags, all-metal, and so on. Go for the Saltiga! lol. The Diawa Tierra is a nice affordable reel with a sealed drag, all-metal, etc. "
520955,cwpowell,2010-11-17 17:01:00,265,"Looks nice doubledigits but I am more partial to Penn or Shimano reels, I've never tried any diawa reels except for the $29 combos."
