146566,kemper,2007-12-30 20:13:00,2232,"Went out today in search of the might steelhead, and decided that it was a perfect day to pop the cherry on my new and first ever float reel. Went to Duffins by 930 am with NO LUCK and everyone around was saying the same thing. Well, I guess ill hop back in the car and hit my home trib, and am I ever glad that I did. Landed my first ever fish on the pin, and what a surprise it was!  Yes, almost in January and I still catch browns, but steelhead? no i long distance release those Here he is in all his  glory!    Now the thing about this 'brown' was that it was unlike any brown ive ever seen. Mouth was small and not hooked, colour was almost an irridescent blue and there was a different spotting pattern along the back. It is hard to tell from the picture but this fish looked more like an atlantic to me. Also, the tail was not square. It was a male fish. What do you guys think?  I am being serious, but i also think that the whole debate is one that I may not have wished to bring back..."

146570,Roy,2007-12-30 20:26:00,13728,"That's a brown, and a cutie too. WTG on your first pin fish. It's safe to eat by the way. It's under 11lbs.  A beautiful fish."
146572,Spiel,2007-12-30 21:04:00,9065,"....Yep it's a brown, a spawned out female (note the loose folds in the belly) starting to lose her spawning colours. Congrats on breaking in the new reel."
