147095,Dondorfish,2008-01-01 17:23:00,1000,"Happy New Year to everyone on the board! I would like to build a sled to tow behind my atv and snowmobile. I want to build it as light as possible and figure aluminum framework would be the best to go to. Can anyone suggest a place where I can purchase aluminum channel (approx 1&1/4"" ) and also angle.  Any help would be greatly appreciated     Don   "
147099,irishfield,2008-01-01 17:32:00,26272,http://www.peckovers.com/  Click Peckovers Concord  Not sure how small an order they'll sell though Don...and they have changed ownership since my last big order so not sure if anything has changed there. Other option is the cheap aluminum (and I'm not talking price) at Princess Auto. Probably good enough for what you want and won't suffer from granular disintigration over the time period you'll be using it.
147103,Fang,2008-01-01 17:45:00,1330,Metal Supermarkets should have everything you're looking for  http://www.metalsupermarkets.com/MSC-store...O&REGION=ON
147104,Corey,2008-01-01 17:52:00,355,"Go to Glanford Iron on Tyneside Rd, their prices are half of Metal Supermarket and have 10X the amount of inventory. They are located just south of Hamilton, less than an hour drive for you. You can't go wrong with them. I have bought tons of metal from them.  cd."
147107,Gerritt,2008-01-01 17:56:00,6129,Don let me know exactly what you are looking for... sizing... ie. 2x2 square tube 10'  I will price it out @ Maintenance Metals in Vaughan... (I have an account there)  G..
147130,fishinfool,2008-01-01 19:40:00,366,"Ability Metals in Pickering is another good spot, it is just south of Tightlines on Brock Rd. I will also be needing some aluminum to rebuild my boat over the next couple of months so hopefully you will get lots of responses here and I can price around.  Good Luck"
147143,Pigeontroller,2008-01-01 20:50:00,2793,"Don, you could try Niagara Glass on Dunkirk rd.  See Tim the owner, tell him Dax sent ya!"
147216,Vanselena,2008-01-02 01:39:00,269,I would think the cheapest place would be a scrap metal yard. Try Greenspoons ask for Moe Greenspoon.
