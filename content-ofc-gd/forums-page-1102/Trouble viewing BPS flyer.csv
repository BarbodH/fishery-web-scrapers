I am usuing Opera if that helps and have checked the firewall and all those things I can think of....any other suggestions?  Even clicking on their ""having trouble"" link doesn't help.  Ok I think I've figured it out..tried it on IE and it seems they've changed to using Adobe Flash player...that just takes way too long to download....guess they didn't think of us poor folks on dial up  Not sure if I'll bother going down tomorrow or not...prefer to have an idea of what's on sale before I enter into the mayhem and madness  Maureen"
