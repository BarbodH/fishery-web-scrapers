146649,Greencoachdog,2007-12-31 02:53:00,8163,"Great report and pics Joey!!!   Too bad about the fish, sometimes ya gotta give the little ones the sore-mouth so the big fat lazy ones can get around to bitin'.  All those people so close yet so far! Somebody needs to set up an OFC flag or banner to attract attention... maybe fire off a couple flares or something!"
