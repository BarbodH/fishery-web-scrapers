146938,bassfanatic25,2008-01-01 00:06:00,36,Got my renewal in the mail about 5 weeks ago.  Sent a cheque in right away for the 3 year sport license and have not received the Outdoors Card as of yet!!!!  Is it possible to get a temporary license on the MNR web site even though I have already sent in a cheque????  I should have just done it online!!!  Thanks
