I hope everyone has a safe New Years Eve and a happy and fishful 2008. Here's the year end report as averaged from our three different stat programs.

(450 Gb) Server Uptime:99.999999%+  Number of new members; 1,495 Number of new posts: 126,000  We seeem to have found a great balance between growth and still feeling like a community. Members have come and some have gone and life goes on. It has truly developed into the ""Community' idea that we all had in mind when we went with this platform. Mostly about fishing...but all about fishermen(and women..I need a non-gender specific term).  Thanks from the head geek for those who helped by offering suggestions or sending me emails when there was an issue. We can't make it all things for all people, but I think from a software point of view, we've made it as close as we can. Thanks to Invision Power Services for their superior hosting and software and to Kim Ritchie for her graphics work. Most of all thanks to the members for making it what it is!"
