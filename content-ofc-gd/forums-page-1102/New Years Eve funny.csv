The Indiana State Wage & Hour Department claimed he was not paying proper wages to his help and sent an agent out to interview him.  'I need a list of your employees and how much you pay them,' demanded the agent.  'Well,' replied the farmer, 'there's my farm hand who's been with me for 3 years.   I pay him $200 a week plus free room and board.  The cook has been here for 18 months, and I pay her $150 per week plus free room and board.  Then there's the half-wit who works about 18 hours every day and does about 90% of all the work around here.   He makes about $10 per week, pays his own room and board, and I buy him a bottle of bourbon every Saturday night. He also sleeps with my wife occasionally.'  'That's the guy I want to talk to - - - the half-wit,' says the agent.  'That would be me,'  replied the farmer."
