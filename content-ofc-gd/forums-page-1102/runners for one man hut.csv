146745,medmart,2007-12-31 15:34:00,587,I just picked up a one hut at bass pro is it worth putting on the sled runners i will be pulling it by hand Thanks in advance  rob
146749,Dondorfish,2007-12-31 15:44:00,1000,they do help - but you can also pick up a set of downhill skis to put under the hut. A one man hut shouldn't be that hard to pull - but if it is - try the skis - work great - just make sure you pick up downhill skis - not cross country skis. I bought mine at a re-use store for $15.00. Hope this helps.   Don
146754,musky66,2007-12-31 15:55:00,273,"Put some old Ice Rink board plastic under my hut runners once- way slippery! Used the thinner 1/4"" stuff from the top rail of the boards on the underside of the 2x8"" runners and it was easy to pull. Hard to find that type of plastic in rinks anymore though- new dasher systems don't use it. Ask the rink staff nicely at an older facility and you may get lucky!"
146756,mcallister.grant,2007-12-31 16:00:00,327,Probably a good idea! Downhills skis and not x-country though! Good luck and congrats on your purchase!

146786,misfish,2007-12-31 16:48:00,29133,Hey Rob. Dosent pop have some of that teflon left? If not I got some here.    I guess that one day out in the wind made up yer mind eh. l m a o  Good on ya for buying one.The trick is to go light when yer hauling it. You dont need a whole bunch of gear like someone we know.
146787,Terry,2007-12-31 16:51:00,14456,I found the pulled easier by hand without runners but if you are going to pull it by atv or snowmobile then get runners
146883,Sinker,2007-12-31 21:22:00,8692,"They save  your sled for sure. Not sure if its easier to pull or not. I know if I didn't have them on mine, it would prolly be worn thru the sled by now. I pull mine with a machine though.......I'd put something on there.  Sinker"
146948,Kerry,2008-01-01 00:43:00,383,I'll be due to replace the sliders on my sled(snowmobile that is) after the warmup next week.I'm gonna use the old ones on mine.Got any buddies that might have some old ones lying around? Kerry
