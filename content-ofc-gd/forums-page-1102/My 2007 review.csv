Out of the few times I got out a couple of the trips were successful. Had this one blow up and totally miss my jackpot. About 20 casts back to the same spot and she inhaled it deep.   cut the hooks, revived her and she swam away with lots of energy. I really hope she made it.   A nice little fall pig for my brother.   My bass season was pretty good. No real huge fish but a lot of really nice ones, a few of my biggest this year came while musky fishing.      I tried a new kind of fishing this year, open water trolling (down rigging, planer boarding, that sort of stuff). I learned this is not one of my favourite ways to fish, but cought some nice fish doing it, including my PB. walleye at 8.6 lbs.      Didnt do much ''trib fishing'' this year, but got out on the big river a few times with decent success.     One of my highlites of the year was catching a 54'' sturgeon while dragging a tube on lake Ontario for bass, took close to half a hour to bring it in.   All around it was a pretty decent year, my only regret is that I did not spend enough time on musky."
