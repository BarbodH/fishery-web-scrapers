146858,krawler,2007-12-31 20:14:00,167,"Would like to target more bass this summer and would really like to fish heavy weeds in severn sound.  I understand you need heavy line, a stiff sensitive rod for hauling the fish out of the weeds.  Wondering if i could find a rod that i can cast with too for spinnerbaits and topwater.  Hope to use this rod for big pike action as well.  Dont have a lot of cash but want a decent outfit.  Ive also never fished with a baitcaster, only ever used spinning reel.  so recommnedations on an afforable reel would be great too.  so recommendaion on rod/reel would be great.   i know its a long way off but im sick in bed and have nothing else to think about.  thanks"

146901,SlowPoke,2007-12-31 22:32:00,2984,"I don't know what your budget is this would make a nice mid-range combo...  Shimano Corvalus 200/300/400 ($69-$79) http://tinyurl.com/2dut9a St. Croix Triumph TRC70MHF 7' med-heavy fast ($70) http://tinyurl.com/yvmzky  I have a Shimano Corsair 400 (Corvalus predecessor) and the same rod. I'm quite happy with it! I've found that the 'cheap' St. Croix has more backbone and as much sensitivity as my medium action Shimano Compre rod at half the price I paid a couple years ago. The reel is reliable but not bullet proof and it's pretty user friendly if you're trying baitcasters for the first time. It doesn't have the VBS (Variable Brake System) but if you're tossing 1/2oz + baits it shouldn't be much of an issue. Spending a little more to get into cast control systems is not money wasted. For example, the Shimano Cardiff for $99-$109 http://tinyurl.com/ytmu47"
146903,PERCHER,2007-12-31 22:38:00,787,I agree with Brian on th Cardiff.It was my first bait caster and it is a great all around reell.Well worth the little extra. Dan
146904,danbo,2007-12-31 22:42:00,2646,"A medium-heavy rod is perfect. Spinning; I'd suggest a Daiwa Exceler 3000 size on a Shakespeare Ugly Stik. Load it with #20 Power Pro line & use a steel leader for pike, fluorocarbon for bass."
