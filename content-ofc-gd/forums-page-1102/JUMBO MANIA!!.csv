146595,ranger520vx,2007-12-30 23:42:00,164,"   Wow.....  stiff and sore but all if GREAT when you have a real good day on the ice.  Fished east side of Simcoe today on about 8 inches of ice in 16 FOW and had non stop action all day long. Seen hundreds of perch swim under hole today with some real monsters.  All fish caught sight fishing with jiggin rap WC3 in silver. SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWW hovering, not jigging key.  Released 2 dozen at 13 inches and kept count of 11 inches. Landed well over 150 today. Best bite 9-11am. Slippery, bring cleats.   "
