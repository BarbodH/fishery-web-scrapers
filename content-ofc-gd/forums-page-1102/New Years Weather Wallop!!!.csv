Please be aware of a heavy snowfall warning for most of Southern Ontario...starting in the Toronto area around midnight and earlier to the west.  The snow is supposed to start falling as people head home from their parties, so please be safe!  Here's the text from Environment Canada. ==================================================================== ..Heavy snowfall to start the new year..  A low pressure system developing over Missouri will intensify and track northeastward to lie over Lake Erie new years morning..Then over eastern New York state Tuesday evening. To the north of the track...A general 15 centimetre snowfall is expected along the 401 corridor.  Snow is expected to develop over southwestern Ontario this evening...Reaching Toronto and the Golden Horseshoe area about the time that the new year is heralded in. The snow will then continue to spread eastward reaching easternmost sections new years morning.  While snowfall amounts for most areas will be near 15 centimetres locales near eastern Lake Ontario could see amounts up to 25 centimetres.  Snow will gradually taper off during the day Tuesday over most of southern Ontario. However the improvement is not expected to reach eastern sections until Tuesday night. In addition lake effect snow in northerly winds off Lake Huron will cause the storm to persist through Tuesday night for areas near the Michigan border.  Cold Arctic air will move into all regions Tuesday night and Wednesday. ================================================================== Check this link for the latest updates.... http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/warnings/son_e.html  Live Southern Ontario radar updates can be found here...check as midnight approaches... http://www.weatheroffice.gc.ca/radar/index_e.html?id=WKR  Here's a wider view of radar.... http://www.accuweather.com/radar-large.asp...nal&large=1"

146857,mcallister.grant,2007-12-31 20:11:00,327,Thanks for the heads up Cliff!!!

146862,irishfield,2007-12-31 20:44:00,26272,Yah Yah Yah !! LOL  Already a mulit-car pile up on 26 just North of Barrie.
146868,douG,2007-12-31 20:55:00,2693,"I think it's absurd that accidents on the 400 series of highways can last for 10 or fifteen minutes.  Even if the cars are only doing 110 or 120, they are bumper to bumper at that speed!  This leaves no reaction time of course, with the forementioned result.  I tell my kids that it's not enough to slow down in bad weather, the crucial part is more room around your car!  A safe and Happy New Year to my OFC friends and their families too."
