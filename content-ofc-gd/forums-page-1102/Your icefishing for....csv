146989,wuchikubo,2008-01-01 03:34:00,1114,"Cool link G.  I've heard about catching smelt through the ice but wow that's awesome. Mmmm yummy bbq'ed smelt on the ice.  However the price was a bit steep for fishing for smelt, about $8 for adults and $4 for kids. I'll have to check out the ice fishing tents when I visit Japan next time.  Stan"
146990,Terry,2008-01-01 03:45:00,14456,you use to be able to fish for them in big numbers on simcoe but I like to kill clean and remove the head before I cook or eat them

147208,Riparian,2008-01-02 00:45:00,269,I just read an article in the latest In-Fisherman about this. They are my favourite pike bait.
