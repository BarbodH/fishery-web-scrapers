146695,mbac31,2007-12-31 12:17:00,904,Lookin for info if anyone has used the new Lakemaster Pro maps yet.
146696,mbac31,2007-12-31 12:20:00,904,They also have the Navionics for someone who wants one for Canada on sale this week at Cabelas http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/template...&hasJS=true
146697,Roy,2007-12-31 12:32:00,13728,I have all of Canada now so I don't think I need any right now. But those prices are excellent!
146699,Terry,2007-12-31 12:44:00,14456,"if I read it right it's their 2006 card, and only the lakes with a * beside them is on the card the rest of the lakes named are on the 2007 card"
146701,motv8tr,2007-12-31 12:56:00,2587,"not sure how to read that, but from what I can see it doesn't have Gbay, Pigeon or Simcoe on it...Dang, could have been a real deal, but I guess there's no point now  Would have cost me 82.71  Maureen"
146702,mbac31,2007-12-31 12:58:00,904,Hey at $59 bucks you cant go wrong. Stll alot of the main lakes there.
146711,Roy,2007-12-31 13:26:00,13728," What you have to remember Maureen is that the Hotmaps are no more than an addendum to the regular Navionics charts. The bodies of water that you name are all on one chip.....the regular Great Lakes chip. It has the GL and the Rideau and the Trent system including all of the Kawarthas , the Larry the Ottawa   etc....."
146716,motv8tr,2007-12-31 13:37:00,2587,"Thanks Roy, other than Nippising those would be the only one's I'd need at least for the forseeable future.  So I'll stick with the regular one....guess I'll get that when I buy my GPS  Maureen"
146778,bucktail,2007-12-31 16:37:00,1857,The good part of it is that it has some of the Muskoka lakes on it. I have the eastern great lakes chips so this should fill the rest of the list of lakes up for me.Wish it had Muskoka but it does have Vernon and others. Thanks for posting!!
