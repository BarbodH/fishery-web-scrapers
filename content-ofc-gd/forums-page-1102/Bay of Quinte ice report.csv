146254,skevys,2007-12-29 14:23:00,27,Just to let you all know what’s happening with the ice. Since the warm weather and the rains we are losing our ice in a lot of spots. I personally will not recommend ice fishing anywhere on the B.O.Q... There are way too many spots that are just not safe (period). Yesterday they opened up 2 shoots at full blast at dam 1 on the Trent River and this is now a DEFINITE place to STAY AWAY from at this time. The Moria River in Belleville is also flowing high and fast so the same applies for it as the Trent. I have been out driving around and have seen a lot of places with the ice has broken away from the shore line. With all these conditions I have personally cancelled all of my guide bookings at this time and have no idea at this time when I’ll rebook. I know some will disagree with some of my observations but the fellows I depend on have been ice fishing for years around here and they have the same attitude as mine. STAY OFF THE ICE EVERYWHERE ON THE B.O.Q. Our long range forecast is stating some very cold nights for next week so we will see what happens. I’ll let you all know for sure next week after we get the cold weather back. Thx. and sorry for the bad report but I still maintain that lives are more important than the almighty dollar……….Ron
