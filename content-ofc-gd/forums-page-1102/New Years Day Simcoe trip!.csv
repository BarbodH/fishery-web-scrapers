146884,tapout,2007-12-31 21:24:00,166,"Hey everyone,  Since many were mentioning they are going to Simcoe I'd thought I'd like to see who is going for sure and I've decided I'm gonna go too.  I was at Gilford Yesterday and Virginia Beach 2 days earlier and VB gets my vote as for the location for tomorrow.  Lots of action and Size.  Also I'm leaving from Brampton so if anyone wants to hook up to share costs then post back here or send me an email and we'll take it from there.  Cheers all.  Tony"
146888,kuhaman,2007-12-31 21:41:00,503,"I'll be out there.Goin out from Gilford,some buddys and I rented a hut. Cant wait!!!!!!"
146902,bassfanatic25,2007-12-31 22:34:00,36,I will also be going out of Gilford!!!!   Should be a fun and snowy day!!!!LOL
146905,Terry,2007-12-31 22:45:00,14456,"yeah, I hope it isn't too snowy"
146906,ccmtcanada,2007-12-31 22:45:00,7971,"Sounds like fun!  Just be careful getting there....heavy snowfall warning beginning tonight.  The further north you go the less the snow, so it could be good for you.  If you're coming from the south, leave early and take it slow.  Good luck!"
146908,ranger520vx,2007-12-31 22:52:00,164,ill be there in the blue CLAM.  come by and say hi!!
146915,PERCHER,2007-12-31 23:06:00,787,Fishindevil and myself will also be there.Also in a blue Clam.I think we need some OFC flags to fly on our huts so we can tell whos who.
146916,Terry,2007-12-31 23:10:00,14456,"does anyone have radios marine or frs we could use them..........  and where is everyone going, I still thinking Gilford"
146921,tapout,2007-12-31 23:23:00,166,"Hey Terry,  It seems to me most are heading to Gilford but I am still thinking Virginia Beach for me.  Adds about 20 - 25 minutes to my trip but its worth it I think.  Better size and you don't really have to go that far out.  Lots of action at Gilford for sure but mostly all dinks."
146922,Mike the Pike,2007-12-31 23:29:00,3421, Now Terry I am not worried about you and lots of snow you have more toys and survival gizmo's than the eskimos not to mention chains on your ATV.Sheesh go fish and give us a report
146926,Tybo,2007-12-31 23:44:00,1373,Joey an I will be there. With a sled and a blue CLAM.
146940,knotaclue,2008-01-01 00:09:00,136,Can’t convince any of my fishing buddy’s’ to go so I may show up alone. Only thing holding me back is the snowy weather forecast
