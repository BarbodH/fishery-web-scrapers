We are supposed to be going in at the end of the month to do some trout fishing but I am wondering if we will be able to ?  Any info would be appreciated. Happy New Years to all.  Be safe on the ice."

You might check with Terry at Eagle Lake Adventures, or Minden bait and Tackle, Norland Tackle Shop has the best bait in the area, on Hwy 35, and has up to date reports"
146790,Jigger,2007-12-31 16:58:00,1237,Was on 12Mile Lake over Christmas. 5-6in of ice. By the 28th the shore ice was very slushy for the first 8-10ft. Without a good cold snap I think it'll be pretty sketchy out there. Esp. on the main lake sections.
