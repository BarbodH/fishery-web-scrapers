146911,steelhedrmatt,2007-12-31 22:55:00,278,"He's usually open NYD, but I wouldn't give that guy a dime of your money. what a scammer. If its just bait your after, the guys will be open I think on the ice at Gilford. just my opinion."
146917,mbac31,2007-12-31 23:11:00,904,"Thanks alot guys,  He is open from 5am to 12pm tomorrow. He has alot of hard to find items there. He has alot of Marks dropshot slammer baits."
146974,mbac31,2008-01-01 02:22:00,904,Does anyone know if he sells licences. I need to get one for a friend of mine.
146978,Loonietoon,2008-01-01 02:32:00,1450,Yes he does
146979,mbac31,2008-01-01 02:36:00,904, Thanks alot man.

147128,mcallister.grant,2008-01-01 19:32:00,327,I prefer the guy on the ice at Gilford. And he usually always has minnows!
147375,fishboy,2008-01-02 19:39:00,550,Pete has minnows there on the ice; I think a second guy has also set up shop.
