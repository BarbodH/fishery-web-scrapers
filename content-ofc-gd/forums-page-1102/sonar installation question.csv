147068,lew,2008-01-01 16:05:00,12767,"Hey boyz, I'm reading over the manual for my new sonar ( Lowrance X510c ) and it says I should install an on / off switch to prevent electrolosis from happening in the power cable. Evidentely this can happen even if the unit is shut off if it isn't hooked to a switch.  Just so I'm clear on this......  Would I install a toggle switch on the dashboard and run the positive lead from the sonar to one side of it, then come off the other side and  go to the fuse panel, and then run the negative wire from the unit straight to ground ??   And one other question.......   I always take my GPS ( Globalmap 7200 ) outta the boat at the end of the day, but the manual says if it's going to be left in the boat continuously, it should also be connected to a switch as the antenna is still drawing juice from the battery even when turned off.  Could I hook the GPS & sonar both to the same switch and then ground them both together ??  Any thoughts ??"
147071,Vanselena,2008-01-01 16:21:00,269,"  You are correct in how to power the unit, the only thing I would add is when you gather power from the battery to  the switch put in an inline fuse.  You can power the sonar and GPS to the same switch.  Remember to run your transducer cable away from any power source.  Transducer installation is a whole other discussion."
147072,sonny,2008-01-01 16:22:00,511,"hey lew,,,ya always want to have the fuse before the switch,,,so it would go,,,battery-fuse-switch-unit....  and as for hooking them up together,,,i don't see a problem other then an interferance problem arising,,,as for electrical no problem,,,but don't forget the larger the load the larger diameter wire you will need to carry it!"
147074,lew,2008-01-01 16:26:00,12767,Thanks guys  Each of these units will be plugged into the fuse panel under the console and will each be on a seperate 3 amp fuse in the block.
147084,irishfield,2008-01-01 16:46:00,26272,Lew.. does your boat not have a master switch on the console? Does it not shut off the entire fuse panel? I know you never run your live well.. let alone when you're not on the water.. so why add another switch? Just hook them to the fuse panel.
147089,lew,2008-01-01 17:00:00,12767,"Nope, no master switch on my boat Wayne, everything runs off seperate switches. I disconnected the livewell and now use that switch to power some interior lights that I installed for night fishing.  When I remove my current sonar, that will free up  a spot on the fuse panel to hook up the new one."
147090,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-01 17:03:00,0,Livewell/Lurebox...  .....Great suggestion Wayne. Be the way to go for sure Lew.
147093,irishfield,2008-01-01 17:18:00,26272,Well guess you need a switch for them then Lew...thought I'd save you a step when you get to the barn!
147100,lew,2008-01-01 17:34:00,12767," Hey Andy, when you've got more oversized baits than space, ya gotta stuff them in any free space ya can find    And Wayne, it'll be an easy job, there's already a knock-out on the dash for another switch."
