Had a wonderfull time skating and playing hockey with my son,makes one want to quit old habits and gain some breath back.We'll see if my will will allow me to overcome.  ya know what hits the most at 40,realizing your kids soon will be on their way to building their owns lives  Jamie,50,not yet man I still holding out hope on anti aging I sorta like the Vinegar years  Happy Birhday to Pete Maina also many happy returns"

147248,darsky,2008-01-02 04:00:00,586,Vinigar years ? More like viagara years.  So you and Petey share the same birthday ? Are you sure you are not long lost twins? A short one that looks like Rod Stewart and a tall one that looks like Peter Frampton- I've seen weirder
147281,graftongal,2008-01-02 11:43:00,145,"Happy belated birthday Marc!!! And Pete too of course! Maybe there is something to being blessed by the musky gods by being born on the first day of the year???  I'm very glad to hear that you got out to play hockey with your son, I'm sure that meant a lot to you."
