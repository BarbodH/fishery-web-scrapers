147021,lew,2008-01-01 11:24:00,12767,It's a good man that treats his dog like a friend.  Thanks for the updates Rick.
147031,JFR,2008-01-01 12:42:00,498,This is great news Rick...happy for you that Jack will be making a full recovery  Have a safe and happy new year.  John
147049,John,2008-01-01 14:34:00,2956,That's great news Rick. Thanks for the update and the pic's. He is in good hands and is a lucky boy.......  John..
146768,bigfish1965,2007-12-31 16:23:00,3382,"Well Jack is home an recouperating. His brother...our golden retriever, was sent to my mother's house for awhile until Jack is better. It would have been too risky having the two of them here since neither seems to know when it is a good time to play or not. Jack is recovering slower than most..he is very tentative on the hardwood floors and doesn't want to get up at all. Can't say I blame him. But progress is being made. I'm off over the next several days and he won't be alone for quite awhile.He detests the cone and can't seem to figure out how to lie down when he has it on. But fortunately it doesn't have to be on him much. I have to use a sling set-up to help him walk and support his hind end for now. In a few weeks he should be walking unaided. Here's a few pics I just took....  Jack wants to thank everyone for their kind wishes and for those who helped in other ways especially.   "
146770,TJQ,2007-12-31 16:24:00,7806,Hes well on the way to recovery... hes got a good friend.
146772,pigeonfisher,2007-12-31 16:29:00,696,"Looks good, Rick.  Hope he picks up over the next few days."
146774,Dondorfish,2007-12-31 16:30:00,1000,Thats GREAT news Rick. Jack is lucky to have a friend that cares so much. Good on you Rick for doin' the right thing! Happy New Year to you and Jack   Don
146779,Greencoachdog,2007-12-31 16:39:00,8163,"Thats great Rick!!! Poor Feller, he looks soooo stoned in the middle pic. I'm sure he'll make a full recovery!"
146783,shane,2007-12-31 16:44:00,652,WTG Jack!    He'll be smiling again in no time.
146785,mcallister.grant,2007-12-31 16:46:00,327,Good to see that he has made it home!!! I am sure he will be better in no time!!!

146871,Rich Clemens,2007-12-31 21:00:00,3131,Good deal Rick.  At least he is home and in familiar surroundings.   He may get used to being waited on hand and foot ... even carried out to do his business.    He may get to like that.   Glad to see he's starting the healing process and don't be too quick on those slippery hardwood floors.  We don't want any slips.
146873,DebS,2007-12-31 21:06:00,56,"Hi Rick, What a good way to end the year - seeing Jack back at home & on his way to recovery! He does look a bit wary in the pictures, but I'm sure he feels great just being home with you again. (And I'm sure that you're just on top of the world to have him back with you again, knowing he's on his way to feeling better than before). I wish you both a very Happy New Year & good health to Jack in 2008!!! DebS"
146881,MAzing,2007-12-31 21:18:00,43,"Lucky dog, I wish I got that kind of support from the wife once back home after my many operations.  MA"

147011,Cookslav,2008-01-01 06:39:00,1457,"Tis But a flesh wound!  Nice to hear he's comming along...sounds like you have the time to support him well, so I'd a bet a speedy recovery is forecast."
147019,Big Cliff,2008-01-01 10:46:00,6899,"What a wonderful way to start off the New Year!  If you go to CTC and pick up a couple of those cheap carpet runners and put them where he needs to go, that will make it easier for him to get around and avoid slips. We had to do that for Andy when he buggered up his leg, worked well and didn't cost a lot."
