146664,wallyboss,2007-12-31 03:41:00,1095,Three weeks to the day.  They could've changed the picture on it. !!!
146694,motv8tr,2007-12-31 12:16:00,2587,"I'll hopefully get mine today, provided CTC has them in now  Maureen"
146698,Roy,2007-12-31 12:35:00,13728,I hope I get mine today. I'm walkin' crooked...my wallet is kinda lopsided without it.
146811,Kerry,2007-12-31 18:14:00,383,"Well talk about leaving it last minute,I just got mine 2 minutes ago.I'm good for 3 more years.Since it took so long you think they could have updated the picture on the card...like maybe a musky or somethin'.I liked the old one with the walleyes on it.Hope the artist gets royalties  cause it looks like he's out of a job. Kerry"
146838,fishfarmer2,2007-12-31 19:18:00,76,I just recived my licence to-day on the 31st how do you like that ?? I turn 62 in 2007 i think its my last licence to buy next time i will be 65 am i right (Boys)  *Happy-New-Year*
146855,Roy,2007-12-31 20:00:00,13728,I JUST got mine a few minutes ago! WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
146890,misfish,2007-12-31 21:45:00,29133,"It would seem the CTC here in Barrie,BOTH,SOUTH AND NORTH stores, do not yet have thiers in the stores. Wal mat not aswell,either store,NORTH OR SOUTH. Local tackle store wont carry them,his perogertive.  What a load of CRAP. Not that Im worried ,as I got to work for the next week or so before getting out,but this is just WRONG.  Good for you all that got yers. This online thing may be good for others,but not for those that CANT.  Happy new year to you all,"
146895,tapout,2007-12-31 22:04:00,166,I just heard the biggest load of crap from the CTC here in Brampton  South.  I just called and enquired about buying my licence there and they said they have them in store but the MNR has told them they are forbidden to sell them until January.  Sounds kinda odd to me.  Anyone know anything about this?
146898,misfish,2007-12-31 22:10:00,29133,Yep same crap here.
146946,skeeter,2008-01-01 00:28:00,1907,fyi: if you know where there is a kiosk for renewing your license plate on your cars they also sell the fishing license's at them too!!! and its very easy and fast with a dated receipt...    Dann
146988,mistyriver1,2008-01-01 03:31:00,600,Bass Pro has em.  Got my sticker yesterday.
147057,FISHINGNUT,2008-01-01 15:33:00,253,Still none here in the KW area talked to 5 different places again on Monday .They all told me the same thing it seems 50 cases aloted for the area got lost in transit somehow .I dont plan on getting out in the next week any ways but I have been trying for the last 3 weeks around here to get one.I know I can get one on line but not every one has the internet.Looks like the MNR dropped the ball once again.
147062,Roy,2008-01-01 15:44:00,13728,"Careful what you say, the MNR is monitoring the site."
147063,Greencoachdog,2008-01-01 15:49:00,8163,I heard that the fine for not having a license is actually less than the license itself... so I woudn't really worry about it.
145742,Dondorfish,2007-12-27 16:45:00,1000,Just a friendly reminder that with the New Year comes the renewal of your fishing Liscences. I always buy the 3 year so that I only have to worry about it every 3 years - this is the year - guess I'll be on - line this afternoon.   Happy New Year all!    Don  
145743,mistyriver1,2007-12-27 16:49:00,600,"Thanks for posting, I did forget."
145747,corvette1,2007-12-27 17:02:00,1765,canadian tire did not have any yet
145759,spoonmaster,2007-12-27 17:32:00,45,"I got mine on-line the other day, Quick and Easy!!!"
145761,JerseyDog,2007-12-27 17:34:00,190,"During a license stop a couple of years ago, the CO told me that if you have the three year, they can find you on the system and can see that your tags are up to date. Saved us a fine that day."
145773,reelinrolly,2007-12-27 18:23:00,281,whats the link for online renewal??
145782,Dondorfish,2007-12-27 18:56:00,1000,www.outdoorscard.mnr.gov.on.ca
145784,POLLIWOGG,2007-12-27 18:57:00,835,"Jerseydog you were lucky, you could still have been charged with failure to show a license.  Used to be they could look you up on the system and double your fine if you were licensed  but didn't have it on you. It was cheaper not to have a license at all."
145787,mbac31,2007-12-27 19:16:00,904,Bass Pro is open on New Years day from 12 pm to 6 pm. They have tons in stock.
145790,Canuck2fan,2007-12-27 19:20:00,1444,I paid for my 3yr renewal on the 29th of November and still haven't gotten the new one in the mail.... I have to find out what I have to do so I can go fishing on the first if it doesn't show up tomorrow.  I do have a print out promising that my outdoor card will arrive in 20 days though LOL so that only makes it about 8 days too late now.  only the government could be this incompetent...
145795,Roy,2007-12-27 19:51:00,13728,Got my 3 year sports mid November and I still only have the print out.
145810,Fisherman,2007-12-27 20:26:00,7201,"Ditto for me, those cretins sure are quick to throw the bill to the credit card, but where's my card. I guess the printout will have to do for now."
145820,addict,2007-12-27 21:09:00,475,thanks for the reminder i totally forgot.
146011,hawkeye,2007-12-28 13:05:00,162,'bout the only good thing about getting older is once past 65 you can forget about the license stuff
146018,Smokey,2007-12-28 13:31:00,1278," I'm with Roy and Fisherman and still haven't recieved mine. Of course when you order it they say delivery is 3 weeks, I'm glad I printed off the temporary as well to keep in my fishing kit."
146019,Tdel,2007-12-28 13:32:00,393,I also bought my 3 year small game and fishing licence online Nov 29th/07 and I am still waiting for the card to arrive in the mail.   I was wondering if I was alone waiting for the card but I guess I am not the only one.  Good thing I printed out the licence.  Tom
146043,Kerry,2007-12-28 14:50:00,383,Sheesh! There must be something up with Nov 29th as I'm still waiting for mine too.If I knew they were going to make me wait 5-6 weeks on line I would have mailed it out. Kerry
146044,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-28 15:07:00,0,Renewed it online myself in November. STILL waiting as well for the plastic. Have the paper print out though.
146047,Guest gbfisher,2007-12-28 15:34:00,0,Not waiting anymore. I just got mine in the mail!!!.... Some ones ears must have been burning
146048,fishnsled,2007-12-28 15:45:00,3520,Good to know gbfisher.  Like some others here I've got the paper copy from when I applied online back in mid November.  So hopefully I'll have mine when I get home from work today.

146076,Fisherman,2007-12-28 17:47:00,7201,"Ya, musta been all the grumpin, got mine today, one headache less."
146078,Tdel,2007-12-28 17:52:00,393,All that whining must of worked because I just got my card in the mail this afternoon too.  Tom.
146096,Canuck2fan,2007-12-28 19:31:00,1444,YEAH my rant worked too!!!! It came in the mail today for me TOO....  Nothing like waiting till the last minute though. I would have been ticked since I only printed off the receipt.... I figured I had lots of time. I just hope the sometimers I suffer from allows me to remember not to trust them when I reup in 2010.... LOL
146097,Burtess,2007-12-28 19:40:00,901,"Wow, they must have been working over the holidays, mine arrived today as well...."
