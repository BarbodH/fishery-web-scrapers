146215,Baptiste,2007-12-29 04:46:00,37,Somebody parked a car inside Al's tonight...I'd avoid the place tomorrow.
146216,urbanangler1990,2007-12-29 05:08:00,933,parked inside? what do you mean
146217,Baptiste,2007-12-29 05:20:00,37,CTV News @ 11:30 Apparently mechanical problems caused the car to drive right through the front window. Looks like a major clean up on Saturday.
146240,Photoz,2007-12-29 13:03:00,792,"Methinks this could be opportunity knocking . . .      I smell a BI I I  I   I    G sale comin' up . . .    only, instead of 'Door-Crasher Specials,' it'll be 'WINDOW-CRASHER Specials?'"
146243,FishFinder,2007-12-29 13:25:00,481,I hope DMASSE is ok.
146244,lew,2007-12-29 13:28:00,12767,"Flaherty's is a nice store, hopefully everything works out for them."
146249,misfish,2007-12-29 13:51:00,29133,"How old is that store? I can remember it from when I was a young,n. It,s on Dufferin right? Just down from the Fair bank swimm,n pond."
146251,Photoz,2007-12-29 14:14:00,792,I THINK it MIGHT have been an Army/Navy surplus store at one time?
146257,motv8tr,2007-12-29 14:36:00,2587,"I'm sorry to hear that, I hope no one was hurt and I'm sure the folks at Flaherty's will be back up and running in no time.  Maureen"
146270,ketchenany,2007-12-29 15:37:00,3229,"Yes Photoz, I lived close by when I was young and that's where we picked up any outdoor stuff that we needed. haven't been in many, many years but one of these days . . . They'll be up in no time."
146279,DMASSE,2007-12-29 16:12:00,420,ALL IS WELL NO ONE WAS HURT  Last night myself and Sam were working around the front of the store when I heard Sam yell Watch out..  I Mercedes Benz crashed at high speed into the front of the main Window.    It missed the counter and flew between the main wall and the counter....    Luckly no one was in the store at the time and that sam and I were on the other side of the counter...  We watched the vidoe ( cool to see )  but scary at the same time...  we both were standing there not more that 5 minutes earlier.  STORE IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS and we will move on..  Dave

146344,HTHM,2007-12-29 20:53:00,4082,"First of all I am glad to hear no-one was hurt! I gotta ask, did you use the line "" Well, thats the way the Mercedes bends""???? As well, are you going to post the video? Best wishes with the insurance company dealings."
146439,DMASSE,2007-12-30 03:10:00,420,"First of all I was trying to explain to everyone who entered the store that it was not a SMASH AND GRAB thing.  Then it went to a DRIVE THRU  SERVICE,  Then finally a DOOR (and Window) CRASHER..  I think people like that  one the best...  I am trying to figue out how to post the pics from my RAZOR   but so far no luck  It scared the craaaap out of me and I couldnt believe even that I was safe I could have died..   we aswser the phone where the car was 10 times a hr.  and some how no one was killed....  anyway its done and I will post the pic and hopefully the video later  Dave"
