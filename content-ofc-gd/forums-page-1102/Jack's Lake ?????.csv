145434,Big Cliff,2007-12-26 13:09:00,6899,"Got a few days off and was thinking I might try to get a day out on the ice. I was just wondering what the ice was like on Jack's lake, are there any huts out yet? It's a long drive up there just to check out the ice conditions.  A sled just went through Sturgeon Lake a few days ago (guy got out OK but I'm not sure if they recovered the sled or not)."
145480,Roy,2007-12-26 16:53:00,13728,Wish I could help you Cliff. You just be careful out there!
145592,icewalker28,2007-12-26 22:52:00,39,"I called Sunday.There have beeen people out fishing but there was too much slush on the ice. I am going up on Friday so i will report what i find. Last i heard there was about 4-5 inches , around when we got the rain. Hopefully she held up with the cold weather."
145672,Big Cliff,2007-12-27 09:20:00,6899,"Thanks icewalker28, I wonder if we are talking about the same Jacks Lake as I see you are in North Bay, I'm over near Peterborough."
146376,icewalker28,2007-12-29 22:28:00,39,"I am in Hamilton now but am origanilly from Peterborough. I am visiting for the holidays and doing some fishing while i'm here. I went up yesterday and we caught 3 crappie , on at 13"" and the other two were smaller. Seen 3 other nice 12 or 13"" caught. Slow day but the crappie went nice with the perch from simcoe the day before. Ice was 8-10 of good black and 2 inches of white on top of that. about 10 guys out. I will put the post and pics up tonight."
146599,fishnpro,2007-12-30 23:52:00,93,"Was out on jacks yesterday and only manage to get one walleye, there was about 8 inches of black ice and about 2-3 inches on white ice. Was also talking to a local and he was saying that hurricane point area is still unsafe."
146638,icewalker28,2007-12-31 02:16:00,39,Here are the pics of Jack Lake 2 days ago. Heading back up tomorrow morning.   
146682,Big Cliff,2007-12-31 11:31:00,6899,"Thanks for the report, much appreciated! We have a few cold days ahead of us then things warm up a bit, 8-10"" of ice is about what I feel comfortable taking my quad out on. got your ice fishing gear ready Beans? (Oh and I'll bring the helmits this time LOL)"
146740,Beans,2007-12-31 15:12:00,3339,Just say when...I'm probably free that day...
146791,Garry2Rs,2007-12-31 16:59:00,1425,"Ice Walker, were your pictures taken in Brooks Bay?  In the summer I live about 14K from there and fish Jack's a lot. Before I got the place down south, I spent a couple of winters in Apsley and recall seeing a line of huts out and to the right of the puplic boat launch. Garry2rs"
146935,icewalker28,2008-01-01 00:00:00,39,That's the one garry. Beautiful lake and close to home which is nice.
