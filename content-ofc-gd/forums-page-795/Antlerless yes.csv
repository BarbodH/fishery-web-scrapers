376340,Jay T,2009-08-25 16:34:00,282,"I got mine, and my extra tag too.. I can't wait to get out in the woods again, and have some peace and quiet. I am still waiting for my big buck from last year to get out of my taxidermists hands, hopefully soon."
376411,richyb,2009-08-25 19:43:00,774,"This is the first year I havent got a doe tag for the rifle hunt. Buck only tag for me, but other camp members have doe tags so life is good. Not lucky in the moose draw either. CALF !!!"
376421,misfish,2009-08-25 20:18:00,29133,"  Wizeninhymer  The land owner is now in the new house.I get daily reports, as he also works in the plant.    I dont think the rifle hunt/control hunt ones are out yet????????????????? Just the archury tags."
376422,misfish,2009-08-25 20:21:00,29133, I bought a big knife.
376454,richyb,2009-08-25 21:16:00,774,  Yes the rifle ones are the same time as the archery tags. The controlled shotgun hasnt happend yet I dont think. My brother got a doe archery for 76
376462,misfish,2009-08-25 21:25:00,29133,Cool thanks. 76 here aswell. Phelpston. Applied for the control aswell. Hope my pop gets his doe tag. That will be the second week hunt for me and my bro and pop.
376480,Skud,2009-08-25 21:48:00,739,Recieved my antlerless for WMU 77 yesturday also. Going to try to get an extra tag now.
376484,misfish,2009-08-25 21:54:00,29133, Thats yer pops place Doug? Maybe do some swap hunts this season?
376502,Jonny,2009-08-25 22:54:00,1380,Got my antlerless tag today. WMU 37.
376506,richyb,2009-08-25 23:03:00,774,"Man , am I the only one that didnt get a doe tag ? what a rip"
376509,evster,2009-08-25 23:06:00,367,Seeing this post and getting an email from my dad I figured mine would be here as well.  It was in the mailbox.  43B for me.  I'll be using it in muzzleloader season in December though.
376513,tjsa,2009-08-25 23:12:00,1578,"The only way we up here in WMU 13 don't get an antlerless tag is if we do not apply, but it is a flippin' huge management area compared to southern Ontario, with the option to purchase more deer tags, antlered only I believe. I do not buy the extra tags so I am not that sure of what I just said. 3 guys, 3 deer, lots of meat. At least enough for us. Now, if I can only get out hunting. Work, and life, has been an issue the last couple of years"
376519,misfish,2009-08-25 23:23:00,29133,Still snowing up there Tom? LOL
376624,tjsa,2009-08-26 02:37:00,1578,"We finally got expected summer weather last week, for about 4 days. I ain't complaining though, I hate the heat wave weather. Most times this summer the highs have been in the 18-22C range, with minimal precipitation until until the last 3 weeks. Then the skies have opened up on us at times. We do need the rain though, just people lament at the rain ruining their weekends, I just fished through it a couple of times, And, the winds have been a pain, just a different year up here for us weather wise."
376704,K_F,2009-08-26 12:02:00,107,I guess thats one of the benefits of hunting down here at home. Antlerless tags are not hard to come by.  I got mine and my additional tag in the mail last night - WMU 87.  35 days to go!!!!!
377348,Skud,2009-08-28 04:00:00,739," Sure, if you like having cold feet while you watch the squirrels play all day."
