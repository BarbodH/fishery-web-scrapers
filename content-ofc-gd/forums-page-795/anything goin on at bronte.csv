376772,shoreman4,2009-08-26 15:55:00,8,Hey Hey  Just wondering if there coming into the rivers yet
376849,Uncle Buck,2009-08-26 20:13:00,1000,"in all honesty, i doubt you'll get many/any replies... if there are fish running, no one is/should be dumb enough to post it on a public board... there is enough fishing pressure with out having it blasted all over the internet... we all know there are lurkers viewing these forums, there is no need to cause added fishing pressure...  only way you're going to honestly find out is making your way down and seeing for yourself... you should then keep that info to yourself..."
376865,LeXXington,2009-08-26 20:39:00,1928,The water's are still very warm. Can't say for sure but I would wait a while
376893,JFish,2009-08-26 21:33:00,29,I have been there twice now and too tell you the truth..I haven't heard a fish jump and I haven't seen a fish caught yet.  I think it's still really early this year for some reason.  JFish
376896,redneck666,2009-08-26 21:43:00,563,ya even up here in SSM its slow...... there is the seldom salmon caught but i havent seen one come outta the rapids yet. just below the rapids and powerhouse is where their being caught.
376923,Fish Farmer,2009-08-26 23:16:00,2234,"Last week I did good out in the Blue Zone east of 50Pt. 270 to 290 FTW. 15 plus Rainbows. I think I may go tomorrow, off 50Pt."
377147,tonyb,2009-08-27 16:59:00,1637,"Further to what Uncle Buck said...It's end of summer, and every year when the temps start dropping at night and there are heavy rains you can expect salmon and trout to move towards great lakes tributaries.  I can gaurantee you that, until the day there are no more salmon or trout in the Great Lakes.  Successful , migratory salmonid fishing is a game of timing, and putting in your time.  Sometimes you can fish 5 nights in a row and get skunked, but on that 6th night you could land 10 fish.  Do you think the guy who has just spent 5 nights skunked and one night catching & releasing double his limit is going to post on here in a public forum right away and let you know where, when, and what he caught his fish on???  Be honest with yourself, and have some good sense.  It's called fishing, not catching, now get out there and go fishing!  Tony"
377195,redneck666,2009-08-27 19:30:00,563,"ya, true. these guys got some good points."
377355,fishinguypat,2009-08-28 04:50:00,547,but than again what the halibut is this forum for? asking measly questions about fishing and getting poor answers from people trying to fool you?or should this forum be about putting people on fish and helping everyone have a good time fishing and hunting...we pay our taxes and we buy fishing licences every year so can we have the right to ask others on the internet questions on where the fish are?...  not to take one out of cronzy's books but ...damn MNR!!!    naw this forum is great just jokin
377374,bucktail,2009-08-28 11:19:00,1857,Yoou might want to wait till we get a west wind to blow some of this warm water out. It has been piling up in this corner of the lake for over a week. Early runnning They will come in in good numbers after the next westerly blow that pushes this warm water out.
377429,JFish,2009-08-28 15:04:00,29,Out again last night.  Nothing much going on.  I myself have still not had the chance of hearing or seeing one jump yet.  Clearly not time yet when you only have 4-5 people total on both piers.  JFish
377458,tonyb,2009-08-28 16:56:00,1637,"JFish, was that you sitting at the end of the Pier on the lighthouse side around 6:30-7pm? nobody was there yet...I was heading out for the evening troll..Black Lund"
377669,camillj,2009-08-29 04:25:00,1988,This rain and drop in temps might see them starting to stage ....
377672,JFish,2009-08-29 05:35:00,29,"Hey Tony, no that wasn't me.  I didn't get there until probably 8:30 or so and there were already a couple people there who left after about 5-10 mins.  JFish"
