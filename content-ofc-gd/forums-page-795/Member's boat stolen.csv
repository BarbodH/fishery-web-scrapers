375800,huey graphite,2009-08-24 13:13:00,362,That's a shame. Hope he gets it back. Can you tell us whereabouts it was taken from?
375893,Handlebarz,2009-08-24 17:01:00,3790,dang that sure does suck where was it taken from Rick?
375987,pro190,2009-08-24 22:25:00,13," Hi, It was my boat that was stolen and it was stolen from the east end of Ottawa (Orleans area)."
375997,bigfish1965,2009-08-24 23:01:00,3382,I would guess it is far from where it was taken by now. The last boat theft ring ended up being in Quebec somewhere IIRC.
