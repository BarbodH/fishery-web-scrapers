377768,Dean Ellison,2009-08-29 15:54:00,39,"  I use my graph also, but it's hooked up to the starting battery. Up front I have a cheaper graph without this function hooked up to a second trolling motor battery...hence the need for a seperate voltmeter."
377803,Billy Bob,2009-08-29 18:13:00,5865,I got a battery meter from Cabela's that monitors both of my batteries. It reads in percentages and changes every 5 seconds while monitoring each battery. They had it on sale for $14.95 and it came with about $10 worth of wire. Definitely worth having one.
