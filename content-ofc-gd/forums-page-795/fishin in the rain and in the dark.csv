As the rain started,, the action did too..... I got 4 small ones tonight....  and one huuge one.... under a tree about 3 feet from shore in the POURING rain !  check the bucket on this baby >>   here is another shot..... sorry it's a bit fuzzy... It was taken on my Blackberry and I was afraid of getting it wet...      What are the thoughts about weighing fish... ie... does it not rip a hole in their mouth ? I am thinking of getting a small digital scale to keep better track of what I am catching."
377603,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-29 02:31:00,0,weight them in something.
377605,Cudz,2009-08-29 02:32:00,2652,That's right!  Way to go
377609,ironstone74,2009-08-29 02:36:00,201,Nice fish man.  I know if you get length and girth you can calculate weight.
377646,Cudz,2009-08-29 03:13:00,2652,"You wouldn't want to rip a hole in a fish's mouth, that might hurt them.  lol! You can weigh you fish carefully by putting the hook of the scale near the bottom where the 2 gill plates meet.  Mind the gills though. I don't do that.  I actually make a new small hole in the bottom lip below the bone where there is a thin layer of skin only.  I figure it can't hurt them that much.  I see teenagers all over the place with lip rings and piercings all over and round the mouth and they aren't crying."

377688,Cudz,2009-08-29 11:10:00,2652,"Exactly. Go to IKEA, buy one of their bags ($1.00). catch fish.  put water in the bag. put bag on scale. Turn scale on.  Put fish in bag.  Done"
