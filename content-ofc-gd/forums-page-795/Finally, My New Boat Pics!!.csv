376622,rtrudeau,2009-08-26 02:35:00,57,Finally sort of figured out how to post a pic again. Here are a few pics of my new (to me ) Starcraft 17ft. Fishmaster. This replaces my 14 ft. tinner with a 15 hp. Johnson. Thanks to FISHERMAN for the advice on adding plug for trolling motor and a battery relay. I am looking forward to many years on this baby!!
