Also the White & McKay 13 was on sale a couple of weeks ago in LCBO's for 21.00 (reduced from 41.00).  It is a nice blend as well.  I truly enjoy the Bruichladich myself, the last bottle I bought was over 100.00 and that was 7 years ago.  A great gentleman from the board once brought me a bottle back from Scotland...nice fella."

376827,Headhunter,2009-08-26 19:18:00,5703,"Well, I for one am very happy that the brewers in this country, have absolutely no idea how much us beer drinkers in this province would actually pay, to keep our beer flowing! HH"
376833,Lunatic,2009-08-26 19:31:00,536,"NOOO!!  hmm,because of low sales, they are going to raise prices......interesting concept"
376851,kickingfrog,2009-08-26 20:16:00,8333, Sounds like an executive from an oil company is running the brewery.
376857,LeXXington,2009-08-26 20:27:00,1928,Just more business for the micro brews..

376918,Fish Farmer,2009-08-26 23:11:00,2234,Looks like I'll be jumping ship. Lakeport looks pretty good now.
376921,Greencoachdog,2009-08-26 23:15:00,8163,Beer is for pregnant women and small children!!!

376935,Greencoachdog,2009-08-26 23:55:00,8163,"  Yeah, they sell real beer and ales here... we use them for mouthwash!"
376969,Whitespinnerbait,2009-08-27 01:11:00,2038,No one really believes that the ''PRICE '' would ever stop someone from drinking Beer......
376970,pigeonfisher,2009-08-27 01:12:00,696,"If any of you ever get up this way (Southern PA or Maryland) you should check out our local favorite.  National BohemianNatty Bo!.  It is presented as being from the land of pleasant living.  I agree!  Another cool PA beer factoid is the eternal tap in St. Mary's, PA.  Learn about the Eternal Tap  PA's most famous beer is now being distributed across the Eastern Seaboard to compete with Sam Adams, Yuengling Lager.  Here we just order ""A lager"" from the waitress or bartender and our beer will be delivered cold, no questions asked.  My beer of choice these days is Yuengling Premium Light.  Americas Oldest Brewery.  If you haven't had ""a Lager"" you should keep American beer slams to a minimum."
376974,Greencoachdog,2009-08-27 01:18:00,8163,  Success!!!... we have brainwashed another Canuckian!!!   ... I've got a Loggerhead... does that count???

376978,pigeonfisher,2009-08-27 01:22:00,696,"I failed to mention that three cases combined...  Straub Natty Bo Yuengling Premium Lite  24 cans x 3 cases = 72 beers 3 cases (11.45+10.95+15.00) = 37.40  You could subtract 1.50 if you buy them ""warm"" as they do charge here for cold beer."

377009,Bob,2009-08-27 02:21:00,370,"I likely haven't had more than 15 or 18 beers in the last 3 years, since I developed diabetes and any more than 1 skyrockets my glucose readings.  I was always an ale drinker though, as in the time and place that I grew up, lager was considered a ladies' drink.  Real men drank ale.  Thankfully, scotch doesn't have the same effect on my glucose and if they mess with the price of Johnny Walker anymore, I can find something else.  I'm not real picky."
377046,bigugli,2009-08-27 07:25:00,6138,"I've had the Yeungling down in PA. Not bad fer a ""lager"".  I'll stick to my ales, reds, porter and stout. Otherwise known as man beer. Olands Red, now there is a beer."
