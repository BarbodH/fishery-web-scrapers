377637,pikeie,2009-08-29 03:01:00,380,"Well as most of you know, I spent my summer a little further north then im used to. I had a co-op placement this summer on Lake of the Woods. I was working and guideing out of Wiley Point lodge which is part of the Toem Resorts chain. I dont think there would have been a better way to spend my summer, it was incredable! The fishing was amazing and the views were fantastic. Every day I got up I could not belive I was getting payed to stay up there. Although I didnt get out guideing as much as I had wished, I had my fair share of days on the water. And I loved every minute of it! So i decided to share some pictures with the rest of you. I had a great season for everything but Muskie. Although I got guests into quite a few fish I my self could only manage 3  . It was very strange because I had so many follows it was starting to get annoying, I think i really have to practise my figure eight over the winter haha.  Anyways here are some pictures I promised.   a beauty 20"" smallie   another nice one   a few decent walleye off the dock   a 37"" northern off the dock   my first forty plus northern! 41.5""   another nice smallie Tinbanger got while he came up to vist   a decent northern Tinbanger got   a nice walleye my bro got no measurement but 27-28""   a 31.5 inch walleye i guided this summer infact i got this guy 2 of them back to back, twin fish lol   me cooking shorelunch     our shorelunch mix   the final product   the main lodge   the boathouse and some of the cabins   the docks, this was during the Rapala Pro staff visit hense all th 620vs's haha   LOTW sunset...   Me and my bro is one of the camp boats. A 17`triumph with 40 horse E-tecs    my 42.5 inch muskie my biggest of the year, but i had guests boat plenty of muskies in the high 40`s. dont worry thats my blood and i have the scars to prove it haha  So i had a great time and am definatly thinking of doing it agian!  any questions feel free to ask!"

377657,kickingfrog,2009-08-29 03:31:00,8333,You will have those stories to tell for the rest of your life.
377677,Handlebarz,2009-08-29 10:16:00,3790,Dang and to think back when I did Co-op I waitsed it at a Ford dealership fixing cars and never went into that job market wish I had been smart enough to do the same as you congrats on such a sweet summer job.  And for all you other your gunns on the OFC site take a lesson from Pikeie and Brandon (he spent a couple summers up north also) dont worry about making all the biggest parties for every summer there is alot of time to party after school is out.  WOW I sound like a old man now that suck's but is true.

377685,solopaddler,2009-08-29 10:56:00,8605,"Outstanding, what a great experience. I've done it myself and I know, it's not all fun guiding. It's usually long days and a lot of work. If you can I'd definitely go back next year. I'd assume you'd get more days on the water...  Cheers"

377729,Spiel,2009-08-29 13:22:00,9065,I know I could have been happy in my youth spending my summers like that instead of partying and chasing women.  Hell I may do it in my retirement someday.
