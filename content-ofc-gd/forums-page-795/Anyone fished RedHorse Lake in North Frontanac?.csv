377692,Ranger22,2009-08-29 11:16:00,18,I have fished Red Horse for Years. Are you Bass Fishing or Lake Trout Fishing? The lake is deep with areas up too 140' but has some great Bass fishing on the deeper edges of the weed beds. There are both LM and SM Bass and good Pike fishing also. I use mostly senkos wacky rigged with baby bass doing the best. I will be up over labor day weekend and plan on hitting Red Horse often.
