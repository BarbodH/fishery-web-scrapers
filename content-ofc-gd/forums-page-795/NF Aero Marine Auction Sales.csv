377479,Fish4Eyes,2009-08-28 19:15:00,1022,For any who is interested in a bowrider/atv/camper. Here is the sale list.  Anybody been to this particular one?  http://aeromarineauctions.com/sales_items.htm
377530,Cudz,2009-08-28 22:35:00,2652,I have been.  It is all a bit shady at times.  I saw one guy who bid against himself 3 times.  You really have to be careful.  There are some good deals but not as good as you expect.  The other thing that really sucks about it is that you never get the trailer with the boat.  You have to bid on the trailer seperately from the boat even if it is a custom trailer that is made specifically for that boat.  It is a bit of a joke that way. You must also pay both taxes and an extra 10% brokerage fee.  so that is 23% more than the price you bid on the boat and trailer (or pretty close to that)
