Two of these boys have never known their father and ride to church on a bus and this will be their first adventure out into the bush camping (Kawartha Highlands).  There are three others going with me, so their will be seven of us altogether.  I have one canoe and my jon boat set up and ready to go and I need another canoe.  There is an outside chance I have on lined up to borrow from a fellow I work with, but if that falls through, anyone know of a cheap place to rent a canoe in the Kawartas?  Not much of a canoe man myself (flipped the last one I was in so I bought a jon boat, lol), any info is greatly appreciated."

377343,wask,2009-08-28 03:19:00,174," Yes, yes and yes.  That will be priority number one.  There are actually only two that have never been on the water before in some capacity.  We will be all saftied up, have no fear.  For that reason we will be in a spot with little to no traffic, very small water, ect. ect.  Will definitely be a learning experience."
