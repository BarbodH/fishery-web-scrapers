Living here temporarly and until I get back to bobcaygeon next year, the only close spots I know of are alway very busy and have cars flying by. (port perry causeway and just west of there).  Any help would be appreciated, just looking for some panfish and will be releasing everything."
377687,Bly,2009-08-29 11:01:00,1556,"Scugog is really your best location but instead of the causeway, try the boat launch and or the docks in town.   Only other places that come to mind would be the conservation areas....Heber Downs and Lynne Shores.  Good Luck"
