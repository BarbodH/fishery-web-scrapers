377023,HTHM,2009-08-27 03:23:00,4082,"As some of the members here know, my father passed away early this morning. So to help me deal with my grief and loss my oldest child and her fiance took me out fishing tonight..........boy does she know her Dad. It was just what I needed! Did not catch a thing except for relief. I found out the most gratifing thing a father could hear; not only do my children love me, they also like me. I will miss my Dad terribly, but I will also thank him every time I pick up a tool and use it with skill. Most of my skills I aquired from his teaching. He taught me to weild a pipe wrench, screwdriver, hammer, but most importantly the value of family.  So I say again, thanks Dad!"
