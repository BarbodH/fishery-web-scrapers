375775,kenzy31,2009-08-24 06:26:00,261,"hey all, i'm posting this question to inquire about some fishing opportunities with these areas in mind.  i will be moving my younger sister back to Carleton U. on Labour Day weekend and am bringing my rod and some tackle with me to try and get in a few hours of fishing.  wouldn't mind getting into a brooktrout or 2, i enjoy bass fishing and pike is one of my faves.  i'm not at all familliar with these parts so any and all education is greatly appreciated.  love the board guys, it gets me through some loooong 12 hr shifts on the weekends here at work!!  thanks, Jesse"
375776,hoot33,2009-08-24 07:01:00,93,are you looking for shore fishing or will you have/rent a boat?
375777,kenzy31,2009-08-24 07:22:00,261,"shore fishing, gas is going to cost enough in my truck without towing my 18' boat! lol"
376808,kenzy31,2009-08-26 17:51:00,261,"hey hoot, noticed you from ottawa from your report on top water walleye.  nice fish by the way!!  wondering if you wanted to hook up for a fish on the long weekend when i'm in town?  let me know, would be cool to get some insight from a local and fellow OFC'r! lol  thanks bud"
376818,hoot33,2009-08-26 18:40:00,93,"lol you chose the only weekend im not free, On the labour day weekend Im going to a family cottage on Lake Baptiste, gonna go assault the bass for about 10 hours a day .  If your ever in the area again let me know though "
377558,kenzy31,2009-08-29 00:37:00,261,"ahh well, guess i'll just have to wing it!!     good luck on your bass hunt, look forward to the post with your results."
377572,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-08-29 01:25:00,0,"every year i've visited ottawa i've fished for smallies right in the city. if you don't mind wading in the wader, the rapids in britannia were spectacular for smallies...didn't get much over 2lbs but we used to catch dozens every outing on small mepps."
377576,Dean Ellison,2009-08-29 01:46:00,39,"Check out Dick Bell Park (about 15km from downtown). I witnessed many people fishing the outer harbour wall (all rip rap) when I was there in late July. I was fishing for Musky from a boat so I can't tell you what's there (I'll post a report when I have time, titled Fishing in the City), but  I suspect at sunset, bass, pike, musky and walleye. Anywhere along the Rideau (hope I spelled that right) is likely good too. It was my impression that not many people in Ottawa fish, (either that or the locals are tight lipped)   .  Good Fishin' to Ya."
377650,Cudz,2009-08-29 03:19:00,2652,"Aren't fishing 24/7, Whitespinnerbait, and Leechman from Gatineau?  Pretty sure they might be.  You need to hook up with those kids.  Shoot them a PM.  They catch fish.  THey could probably point you in the right direction. I believe Gatineau is Hull, but again I could be wrong.  Anyway it is the city directly across the river from ottawa, like 3 minutes away."
377666,kenzy31,2009-08-29 04:12:00,261,ya iwas thinking the same thing Cudz.  but also wondering about license requirements for crossing over.  should check into
377674,trout-eater,2009-08-29 08:21:00,21,"http://www.fish-hawk.net/index.php?page=2  lot's of people fish in ottawa. check out that site, it should help you out. just do a search"
377675,Roy,2009-08-29 09:43:00,13728," Ontario and Quebec have a reciprocal agreement for fishing permits on boundary waters such as the Ottawa River. On this river, only one permit is needed, either an Ontario or a Quebec license."
377770,Dean Ellison,2009-08-29 16:02:00,39," That's fine while in a boat, but does that also apply to shore fishing on Quebec side??? The regs weren't to clear on this."
377785,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-08-29 17:16:00,1362, Would you be interested in trying your luck for some Muskie  ?????.....
377792,Cudz,2009-08-29 17:29:00,2652,Do it! Do it! Not only do you have a shot at a muskie but you even get to go on a pontoon boat (possibly)!  I love pontoon boats.
377866,kenzy31,2009-08-29 23:34:00,261,  HELL YES!!!  never fished for them before but would love to!  how do we make this happen??
377870,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-08-29 23:59:00,1362, Send me a pm of the dates you're in town along with a phone#
377875,Mike the Pike,2009-08-30 00:16:00,3421, Yes Paul I would I start covering Ottawa next week as my Company has expanded my territory so I can increase my sales.  BTW I have not caught my first Muskie yet.Hint hint.
377948,Cudz,2009-08-30 05:04:00,2652,"Hey guys don't forget; boats run on gas, not thanks. lol"
