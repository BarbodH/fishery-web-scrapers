377878,Fang,2009-08-30 00:30:00,1330,Drive across the bridge and turn left at the lights. It's about 100 yards on your left. There's no docks or signs so don't blink. You can circle around and park on the south side of the road or back up a couple streets off the road. There is a marina and pay to use ramp on the south side.  Ive got a 1750 crestliner and the public ramp was a little hard on my trailer. It starts off shallow and then just drops so your trialer rails most likely will bottom out.  Remember it's 10km/hr no wake all the way to the rail bridge. Cottagers are all out and they've been known take boat numbers on anyone pushing the speed
