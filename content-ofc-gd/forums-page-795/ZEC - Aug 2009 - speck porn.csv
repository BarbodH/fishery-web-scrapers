377690,Greencoachdog,2009-08-29 11:14:00,8163,"Great pics and some really nice fish!!!  Good friends and good fishing make for excellent memories!!!  Be careful fishing barefooted like that, I imagine a hook in the foot would be pretty painful."

377953,camillj,2009-08-30 05:30:00,1988,Thanks folks ... yes its a piece of heaven ... whats odd about it is that we are actually in the clouds ... the clouds are literally on the lake at times ... its way up high in the mountains so I guess its the closest I can get to heaven with a fishin rod in my hand  I happen to believe that specks are one of natures purdiest and tastiest fish  ... and I am so thankful to be have the privelege to partake ... one day I'll see if we can organize a G2G for anyone interested in the 10 hr drive ....  And dont worry dawg ... I keep the hooks away from my toes
