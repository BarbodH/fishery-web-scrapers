377470,bubbles,2009-08-28 18:26:00,591,"I have an ""oldie but goodie"" 50HP merc that has a slight attitude lately and I am looking for some advice. Everytime I try to fire it up it takes a long time to get it going, maybe 5 minutes of trying or so, turns over well, just wont fire.  Here is the kicker, if I fire it in the drive way no issues, and once it has been running in the water it fires within 1/2 a turn.  I can be out all day, starting and stopping the motor and will not have the issue again, ...................................until next time I put it in the water ofcourse.  My motor has been doing this for a couple years now and I would like to fix it if at all possible.  Thanks Kev"
