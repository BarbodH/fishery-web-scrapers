Imagine using medium action spinning gear and catching a fish I would compare to a smallmouth but on steroids.  Had the pleasure of fishing for tarpon on a trip to Puerto Rico.  Had a 100 lbs. class fish on but lost it near the boat when the leader broke.  Lost another quality fish when it jumped out of the water like a missile.  I was in complete awe that I forgot to bow to the mighty king.  I was able to land two smaller tarpon around 15-20 lbs.  Amazing how they turn there bodies sideways, just like smallies, thumping there tails trying to stay down.  Tom"

Caught a few smaller cudas from around the marina at the hotel we stayed at.  One of our friends is looking at renting a house in Big Pine Key in February.  If all goeas as planned, I will hopefully have a chance at catching another silver king.  Tom"
