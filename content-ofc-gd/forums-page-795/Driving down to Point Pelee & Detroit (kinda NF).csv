There wouldn't be much fishing time as I'm with the whole family. As of now, we plan to visit Point Pelee National Park, spend a day on Pelee Island. Of course we'll go over to states side for BPS and prime outlet for the ladies.  Am I missing anything here? I will try to squeeze in a few hours of fishing I guess, any ""must-fish"" areas?  Thank you once again!  Victor"

Its supposed to be the same Latitude? as california..  When i was there we rented these crappy bikes for an outragous price and rode around the island.. There is a restaurant on one side, not sure which one.  If you want to bring a rod around there are some alright looking spots off the side of the road.. kinda like lake ontario.. deep with large retaining rocks.. maybe some smallies hiding in there.  Have fun.."
377359,Victor,2009-08-28 05:37:00,1609,Thanks Pikehunter & Shore_Lunch  We do plan on renting bikes at pelee island ... $20 for a full day ... helps kill some time I guess as I don't think there is really that much to do on the island. I will bring a travel rod and try to catch a fish or two.  Thanks again.
