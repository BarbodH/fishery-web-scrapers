377500,Douger,2009-08-28 20:42:00,116,If anyone knows a reliable seller I'd appreciate it (i.e. honest - no poaching).  OR... Last year I missed a chance to go in on some roe with someone who had access to hatchery roe. I could have got a pound of it pretty cheap.  I'd be interested if anyone has access to bulk roe.  Thanks!
