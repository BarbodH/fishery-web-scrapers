363262,hawg_hauler,2009-07-17 11:30:00,69,One important factor to keep in mind! There is a Mercury dealer on every corner in Ontario. The same can't be said for the competition. Summer is short and being able to get service and/or parts fast might be key in choosing your brand!
363268,Raf,2009-07-17 11:49:00,3495," 25hp is 25hp, whether it's from a 2, 4 or 2000 stroke engine.  there may be small differences in where in the powerband (rpm)  power is made and 2 strokes typically make more torque earlier in the rpm band (quicker to get on plane) but let's ignore that for now.  the big difference lies in power to weight ratio.  take a 3000lb 200hp car and race it against a 2000lb 200hp one, everything else being equal - which one will win?"
363301,Jonny,2009-07-17 14:02:00,1380,So going to a different pitch prop on the same motor won't change your top speed?
363302,Dara,2009-07-17 14:11:00,3052,"  There is only so far you can go with a prop, then you over rev the motor. The right one is the right one"
363309,scugpg,2009-07-17 14:26:00,1373,"You can't get rid of the added weight from a four stroke. What ever motor you get - go with the max power. Do it once, do it right.  For arguments sake, would a 20hp 2-stroke be about the same speed on his boat as a 25hp 4 stroke given the weight difference?  Anyone: How efficient are the new 2-stroke outboards (non-etec). From the article about they were comparing the Direct injected 2 strokes vs. 4 strokes. Other than the Etec I don't believe they come in as low as 25hp?"
363310,Jonny,2009-07-17 14:29:00,1380,"Maybe I don't understand prop pitch. I'm not being facetious, it's quite possible I don't.  Here's my understanding...  Coarser pitch means each blade takes a bigger bite out of the water, so it pushes more water --- harder to do, so the motor has to work harder and the RPM's would be lower. But the boat should go faster if the motor isn't overloaded. So ideally a prop should be set to as coarse a pitch as the motor can handle. So a prop that makes the boat go faster would actually not be able to over-rev the motor.  Does that sound right, or am I out in left field? (I have a feeling I might be WAY out there!)"
363590,hawg_hauler,2009-07-18 03:41:00,69,Yes and no. Prop pitch should be based on the boat and the normal load that said boat would see. A guy that spends most of his time in the boat by himself would get away with a higher pitch than a family of four would in the same boat! This is especially so with smaller boats. you want to see max rpm or close to it under normal load and normal conditions in order for your motor to perform well. This also gets complicated with small engines as most manufactures supply props with engines under 25hp.

Try to find a 2 stroke that is a few years old that runs 100:1. Oil injection is way better though if you can find one.  An Etec or 4 Stroke you're looking at about 40-50lbs of more weight in a 25 I believe."
362696,jr7roo,2009-07-16 00:22:00,14,First Thanks to everyone who replied and gave me there opinion After reading all your responds and doing lots more research on my own  I broke it down to a choice of 2 (Really liked the ETEC but it's just not in the budget at this time)  25hp  2 stroke Mercury   115lbs    $2549 20hp 4 stroke Mercury 2009  157lbs     $ 2899 (Discount price through a friend who don't have 2 strokes available)  I thought they didn't make 2 stroke mercury any more...I found a dealer that told me they had a 25hp 2 stroke mercury Brand New!! My first question to him was what year is it...The dealer replied and said Mercury don't put years on there motors any more they build there motor as LOTS...I was a little unsure about the answer he gave me thinking he was not telling me the truth and he  just wanted to sell me a older motor cleaning it up removing the date label on the older motor and sell it as a newer motor... so I decided to do much more research and I phoned Mercury Marine Canada...I asked them do they still sell NEW 2 stroke motors she answered YES we produce a certain amount of 2 stroke motors and distribute them to certain dealers every year...Then I asked her are the motors 2009 dated she said they DON'T date them any more there motors are build as lots and the lots can go back in date as far as one and a half years but on there motor crate there is a date that tells you when the motor was produced... When I heard this I realized the dealer was telling me the truth.  So here's where I am ONE last question  Can you tell me the average price on maintenance for a 4 stroke and 2 stroke Yearly? (as I am shying away from the 4 stroke as I heard they are MUCH higher and expensive to maintain)  Thanks jr7roo
362710,hawg_hauler,2009-07-16 00:56:00,69,This year is the final build year for all Mercury two stroke carburetor engines from 20hp to 115hp. If engines were not ordered by dealers by July 1st they won't be getting any.  The price for annual service to a four stroke would not be anymore than the amount of oil a two stroke is going to burn in a season.
362716,2 tone z71,2009-07-16 01:02:00,1311," my DS 650 Baha is a single cyl 4 Stroke,Bombi knows how to do it ,well Rotax anyhow,they also have supercharged and non 4 stroke Seadoos,I also thought they brought out a 4TEC in the Rev,either was when I took the cover off my Etec 115 I couldent see the block anywhere a MASS of sensors wires plugs crap,a modern day 4 stroke I could lay my hand flat all over the place ,Yamahas anyhow,so ticked off at my Etec sold boat and all,think your Etec is the crap ill give ya names and numbers of people with blown up ones in under 100hrs,think it wont need service for 3 yrs dont Kiss your mechanic good bye just yet"
362730,Fisherman,2009-07-16 01:25:00,7201," Well here's one last answer for the 4 Stroke average maintenance cost.   I know somebody(don't care to look it up who) that spouted of the much higher cost of maintenance for the 4 stroke, I call Bull Dung, he doesn't know what he's talking about.    Anyway, I fuel filter, (no name brand will do) $4.00, one oil filter, they run about $4-$6, depends where you buy them. Two litres of good 10/30 or 10/40 motor oil, about $6-$10, depends on your brand.  One 500ml container of 75/90(maybe 80/90 depends on your mfgr) marine lower gear oil, around $5-$7.   That's for a years fishing, total $25-$30 of maintneance, gas not included.  There you go."
362732,danbouck,2009-07-16 01:31:00,4380,  Bang on! Maintenance on a 4 stroke is not expensive at all. For that price I would go 4 stroke 100%
362734,Dara,2009-07-16 01:35:00,3052,"  Other than the 2 litres of motor oil and the oil filter, its the same as a 2 stroke. The 2 stroke needs oil in the gas and ya gots to carry spare plugs in case you foul em.  Black huh...you know how to swear?  Tough decision really. Thats a good price for that 25, 2 smoke A 15 yammie is a grand more"
362775,F7Firecat,2009-07-16 02:42:00,347,"fisherman sure likes his 4 stroke LOL maybe more than his wife  Honestly on a small little tinner boat like that I'd go with the etec, less weight which is huge on a small boat, about the same in gas consumption, add 2 stroke oil oil when needed just pull and go. Sparkplugs.... the things will last forever these days they run so clean.  And before I get bashed I own a Verado and love it also just like fisherman loves his honda."
362817,pikehunter,2009-07-16 09:58:00,1659," Sounds like a reasonable price. Is it a short shaft and pull start? I think at the price it probably is. Also are there any other charges that were not mentioned to you? My 2005, 25hp, 2 stroke (not E Tec) Johnson long shaft with electric start was more than that when it was new."
362822,hawg_hauler,2009-07-16 11:11:00,69,"Go with the two stroke, it's cheaper and it is five more horsepower. Both should come with a three year warranty (verify this with your dealer). You will get better performance from the two stroke. In my honest opinion, anyone who could have had the opportunity to take both engines out for a test on the same boat would pick the two stroke every time. They even run pretty quiet nowadays."
362824,Fisherman,2009-07-16 11:21:00,7201,"Well it's more reliable than the wife, never says no to going fishing, never misses a stroke, low maintenance, did I mention it never misses a stroke,  , not like you 2 stroke guys"

362860,Billy Bob,2009-07-16 13:12:00,5865,"The owner of Ivanhoe Lodge told me he removed all his 4 stroke small outboards that were only 1 year old because of the extra weight AND they couldn't get out of their own way. Traded them all in for 2 stroke Yammys. He had too many complaints from his clients about the lack of speed.  The extra 42 lbs could be crucial in a small boat. AND the two stroke will give you more power and speed than the same hp in a four stroke. This might not effect you or it might depending on how much other weight you fish with....do you fish alone or with someone........how heavy are you and or fishing partners.....  Now both of these factors might not play into your decision depending how small of a hull you boat is. Here is what I would consider giving the two choices you have with everything being equal.  1) Is the 2 stroke oil injected or do you have to mix oil manually each time you need gas. If not injected I would go for the 4 stroker.  2) Are you handy to do your own oil changes, etc........... if not go with the 2 stroker. The prices everyone here have quoted is ONLY the parts, labor is going to COST you much more if you take the engine to the dealer for maintenance.......  3) Saving $350 PLUS all your taxes up there comes to what, almost $1000.........LOL  You are in a great position, purchasing new power for you fishing machine. Try to chew the dealer down with today's economy. Too bad your not  dealing with tow different dealers on the engines you have to choose from. Working one against the other always helps.........you should be making a offer on the engine of your choice.......the price is always dictated by the BUYER.....retail is for suckers (not the fish)....  Now go purchase one of those motors, report back and catch some fish before the ice returns.  Bob"
362884,pikehunter,2009-07-16 14:00:00,1659,"Billy Bob made some good points.  A lot of folks say 4 stroke or nothing, but what size motor or boat are the guys saying this running? Remember a 20 or 25 hp tiller with the operator (especially a heavy dude) at the throttle is quite different than a larger motor with a skinny guy at the wheel on a console boat. Every pound added at the back of a boat can make a difference, that 20, 30 or 40 pounds in added motor weight is a factor.  BTW, I have no problem adding oil to my 2 stroke, pretty simple, just add 1/2 a small bottle to 12.5 litres of gas or a full one to a full tank which is about 24 litres just before putting the gas into the tank. As for maintenance I just change the bottom end oil in the fall, fog the engine and grease the fittings, done!"
362898,scugpg,2009-07-16 14:24:00,1373,On a small boat like BillyBob said I'd be going with the 2 stroke. Weight is crucial - 43lbs less + 5 extra ponies will be really nice! plus you're saving money.  I think Yamaha is the only one that does 100:1 mix though?
362912,Jonny,2009-07-16 14:40:00,1380," I've been adding oil to the gas for my 2 stroke motors for so long that it's just an accepted ritual. It's not a hassle.  One of my motors is a 1980 25 HP Mercury tiller handle, used to be my primary motor and has seen a LOT of use. I take care with it so it still looks shiny and much newer (had to re-paint the lower unit --- too many miles of gravel road). Proper gas/oil mixture (careful about that), lower unit oil change before winter storage, carb cleaner in the gas at least for one tank-full a year, fresh plugs once a year, and it's still going strong, never needed any other maintenance. A real workhorse.  I don't know if they build them the same any more, but based on this motor I'd buy two-stroke again with no problem."
362930,Dara,2009-07-16 15:31:00,3052,I personally wouldn't both with a 4 stroke under 30 hp To me the biggest reason for a 4 stroke is fuel savings. That counts in your 50 and up motors. These little 25's sip it anyway. 20 hp 100:1 Yammie is my call. But at 2500 for the black 25...why not
362937,Raf,2009-07-16 15:44:00,3495,"I think I agree with Dara, in the small motor class, unless you're finding the 4str at a great bargoon I would go 2.  I dont believe there's a huge fuel savings in these small motors."
363093,Calender Don,2009-07-16 22:00:00,39,I have a 14' boat with a 15hp Yammie it's a four stroke by myself in the boat 23mph and I'm 240 lbs trust me four stroke are faster than the older 2 stroke. If I add a buddy thats 200lbs I'm about 19-20 mph according to my GPS (garmin)
363103,Jonny,2009-07-16 22:57:00,1380,So where are these differences in actual power (either way) between 2 stroke and 4 stroke?  Ft/lbs of torque (affecting prop pitch)? RPM's? It should be quantifiable.
363104,Billy Bob,2009-07-16 23:04:00,5865, If you have used both in real life fishing situations then the answers are right in front of you...........

My two stroke Johnson is light at 75lbs, my Honda's a little heavier around 105.  From a 20L tank, my two stroke gets about 75km to my four strokes 90km.  I never did mind mixing the oil and gas.  If I had to chose just one though, the 4-stroke would be it.   For your boat go the max horsepower.  For smaller 4-stroke outboards choose Honda first... the rest in whatever order ya want.  However, if you think you'll be boating in places where a solid lower end is important for taking the odd bump... choose Honda or Johnson before Merc or Yamaha."

This is my First boat ever owned and would like to hear some feedback before I go and make the big purchase.  My questions to the forum is Would you purchase a 2 stroke or 4 stroke and why? Would you purchase Mercury/Evinrude/Yamaha/Johnson ETC why? Would you max out the hp and purchase a 25hp or go smaller to 15hp or 20hp?  Thanks jr7roo  
360949,Fish4Eyes,2009-07-11 16:32:00,1022,"All the above mentioned are good brands. If your buying new something to consider would be which brand offers the best warranty. 4 stroke costs more, but is much quieter, better on gas, and doesn't smoke as much."
360952,SBCregal,2009-07-11 16:51:00,688,"4 strokes are also quite a bit heavier, the 4 stroke merc 25 comes in somewhere around 170lbs or so.  i believe the more current 2 strokes use much less oil in the mixture so they'll be considerably cleaner than the old 2 stroke motors."
360975,danbouck,2009-07-11 18:47:00,4380,"You're going to get every different answer possible on this one.  IMO If you can afford to max out the HP do it. All the big brands are good, I have a 4 stroke merc and it's fantastic. I also have a 70's Johnson that's great. I would go for the 4-stroke just because it's cleaner, quieter and better on gas. Again it depends on your budget."
360976,glen,2009-07-11 18:52:00,2641,Would you purchase a 2 stroke or 4 stroke and why? Would you purchase Mercury/Evinrude/Yamaha/Johnson ETC why? Would you max out the hp and purchase a 25hp or go smaller to 15hp or 20hp?  Four stroke burns way less gas. The plugs last a long time.  No gas/oil fumes.  Any brand is ok i guess.  Max the hp because then you can run the motor at 3/4 throttle and save on gas.
360977,Billy Bob,2009-07-11 19:19:00,5865,"If you're concerned with all out speed the 2 stroke engine is the way to go and that would be the Evinrude ETEC engine. http://www.evinrude.com/en-US/Flash/index.html  For quietness I would look at a 4 stroke Honda or Yammy outboard. But 4 strokers are more money and more maintenance and more weight and that could be a safety factor in a small boat.  If it was me purchasing a brand new motor right now it would be the Evinrude ETEC series.  Good Luck with the New Rig,  Bob"
360990,Bigfisherman,2009-07-11 19:51:00,100," I second that! A 25hp Etec would be sweet! I love my 75Hp Etec, awesome motor."

361030,NAW,2009-07-11 21:54:00,4022,"You also have to consider what you are going to be using the boat for.  A 25Hp 4 stroke, as previously mentioned, is a heavy motor.  If you’re going to be taking the motor on and off the boat a lot, then you'd better have a strong back!!  I park my boat in front of my house all the time, and for that reason, I remove my motor almost every time I use it (15 Hp merc 2 stroke).  It's light, and easy to move around.  Not the case with a 4 stroke of similar or greater Hp.  However, the 4 strokes are far better for the environment.  It's a bit of a toss up.  If I had the cash, I’d get a 4-stroke, 25 Hp for that specific boat.  But I’d also get a real nice locking device so I could sleep at night, and not worry about my motor getting swiped."

361066,Billy Bob,2009-07-12 00:34:00,5865," The Evidrude ETEC outboards are maintenance free for 3 years. Not so with 4 stroke engines with periodic oil changes plus many are required to return to the dealer so the heads can be re torqued, etc..........None of this is required on the ETEC motor. The two stroke ETEC will produce more HP faster than your 4 stroke Honda. It just the way it is.... Now don't get me wrong, I think the Honda is a great motor and the quietest of the bunch but it's just not the best at everything.  I even bought my wife a Honda Civic for herself. Honda is world wide know for producing great motors......"

Lower unit oil, once a year.  So I am assuming then that the Etec takes less than 1.7qt(1.6l) of oil per year to inject with the gas ,cause that's all it takes for an engine oil change for the Honda. Soooo, I think you might be paddling a bit after your 1.7qt of oil run out in the oil reservoir in the Etec while the 4 strokes are still merrily motoring along.  Go back to the dealer for periodic maintenance, jeez, mine must be coming soon I hope,,,13 years and not back yet, seems like a pretty good track record."
361083,Greencoachdog,2009-07-12 01:08:00,8163,"You'll be happier with a 4 stroke... I'll never go back to a 2 stroke!!!  All the major brands are good... but I keep seeing 'Rudes and Johnsons painted black, it makes them go faster yanno!!!"
361105,craigdritchie,2009-07-12 02:24:00,1586,"Assuming you're looking at a new motor, your choices are pretty simple. Johnson went out of business a couple of years ago (for the second time), so they're out of the picture. The only two-stroke left on the market in the size range you're looking at is the Evinrude. Pretty much every other engine manufacturer out there - Yamaha, Suzuki, Honda, Mercury, Nissan and Tohatsu - scrapped their small two-strokes years ago, and have been building four-strokes ever since. On that basis alone, guess which type of engine is more popular?  Four strokes don't require you to burn oil with your gas, so they're way cleaner. They don't pollute, they don't smoke, they are amazing on fuel and they're far more reliable. True, they are also a bit larger and heavier than a  two-stroke, but whoopee do - the benefits more than make up for that. First time you troll on a windy day and don't have to inhale all that engine exhaust stench, you'll realize how much better they are. Or when you fish all day and catch yourself tapping the fuel gauge because it still hasn't moved. It's not broke - small four strokes are just really good on gas.  Some people like the Evinrude E-Tecs, but I confess I'm not one of them. The fact Evinrude doesn't have many dealers around here any more is a real concern. I think there might be more Yamaha dealers in the GTA than there are Evinrude dealers in all of Ontario. That's something to think about if you ever need parts (even something as simple as a new prop).  Everyone has their own opinions, preferences and biases. Take them all with a grain of salt - mine included. Go talk to a couple of different dealers and see what they have to say. Ask about warranty coverage, about service plans, and about the availability of parts, props, and such. If you stick with a major brand (Yamaha, Suzuki, Merc or Honda) and buy from an established dealership, it's hard to go wrong.  Oh - be sure to ask about non-current engines. Some dealers still have (or can get) brand new 2008 engines. Sales have been slow this year, and there are still a lot of '08s in the pipeline. You can likely get a better deal on one of these."

361117,Jonny,2009-07-12 03:02:00,1380,"Once your motor weight goes above about 100 lbs. you'll have a hard time handling it by yourself, even to get it onto and off the transom, if that's a consideration.  For that boat, I'd seriously look at something like this...  http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/products/produc...up=O#contentTop  or this...  http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/products/produc...up=O#contentTop  I'm not so sure any boat should be powered by a motor that hits the max rating.  Two stroke/four stroke, I think it's a toss-up.  If money is a consideration, I'd look around for a well-cared-for used motor, even 15 to 20 yrs. old. They're out there.  ---  ""Exhaust stench""? Man that's perfume! I've loved that smell ever since I was a kid. But you don't get much of it, if any, with thru-the-prop exhaust."
361138,DRIFTER_016,2009-07-12 03:32:00,10439,FYI Mercury has a standard 3 year warranty on thier motors and if you buy before the end of July they'll add 2 more years. We have been running Merc 30hp 4 strokes at our lodge for about 7 or 8 years and they extremely well. You don't really have to worry about theft as they are bolted on (they don't use the clamps).
361177,pikehunter,2009-07-12 09:30:00,1659,"When I first read your question I thought you would have to go for a 4 stroke because they didn't make an Etec in a 25hp. Then I looked it up, they now do make a 25hp Etec engine! Finally I thought, wish they had it out in 2005 when I bought my new 2 stroke 25hp Johnson.  Either way you will have a motor which is heavier than an old style 2 stroke. I think I like the Etec more than the 4 stroke because of the maintenance and the slight weight advantage. The Etec is a very quiet motor just like the 4 stroke.  How do they compare in price?"
361178,Roy,2009-07-12 10:19:00,13728,"I think that most guys will boast about what they currently own. I'm no different. I have a 4 stroke Mercury and I find it very reliable, quiet and economic. I think that Yamaha is a good brand to buy as well but I don't own one. I just Googled Etec recalls and that just doesn't impress me at all.  Keep in mind that this is just my opinion as a satisfied Merc owner."
361197,hawg_hauler,2009-07-12 13:18:00,69,"First and foremost Mercury is my brand of choice, however with a two stroke direct injected outboard available in a 25hp model, I would have a hard time buying black. Two stroke direct injected engines run as clean if not cleaner than a slobbering four stroke carburetor engine (which the majority in this hp range would be). They use very little oil and are extremely good on fuel and you don't have to stand at the dock for five minutes while your engine warms up!  In this case don't worry about the brand, go for the technology."
361209,Billy Bob,2009-07-12 14:19:00,5865," I took your advice and did both (merc and ETEC) and they are about the same when googled.....the results is something that can be researched and found on just about ANY product out there. There is always someone have problems with something they buy......I don't put too much faith in that kind of thing...  BTW I don't own either but if I was in the market I would be comparing Honda, Yammy and ETEC engines......I had a Merc years ago and the bad taste is still there but doesn't mean they make a bad motor...."
361264,musky_man,2009-07-12 19:13:00,159,Personally I'd go E-tec      
361428,solopaddler,2009-07-13 11:31:00,8605,"I happen to have a 25hp Yamaha 2 stroke for sale, would be perfect for your boat. Check the classifieds...."
361450,Dara,2009-07-13 12:53:00,3052,Evinrude Etec is Bombardier. They just refuse to make a 4 stroke. Even in their snowmobiles. They are doing everything they can to stick with a 2 stroke while every other manufacturer is developing 4 stroke technology.
