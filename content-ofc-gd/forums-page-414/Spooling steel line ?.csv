690958,mattybculp,2012-04-28 19:58:00,388,Hi guys I have recently purchased a newline counter reel a new steel line rod and of course some steel line. Im a newbie when it comes to steel lining and im wondering about the method of putting it on my reel . Any particular knots to secure it to the reel ? any particular method for spooling it on ? thanks guys
690961,Raf,2012-04-28 20:17:00,3495,Make sure you spool it on with lots of tension.  A partner helps.. they can hold the spool on a screwdriver and with work gloves put tension on it while you spool it on.
690973,mattybculp,2012-04-28 21:23:00,388,thanks raf. Would you use any tape ie duct tape for some backing for the line to grab on to?
691069,Joeytier,2012-04-29 01:52:00,3990,"Before you put it to use, let out the entire spool and reel it in nice and tight.  Don't put steel right to the spool.  Dacron backing is the way to go."
691116,Sinker,2012-04-29 03:48:00,8692,"I used 30lb mono backing, then the wire, and like Joey said, let it all out with a big plug on and reel it back in when your trolling to ""stretch"" it out.  S."

If so make sure you never ever have any loose line.  When tying your knot to the big swivel, put a giant bead on before the knot.  Always reel your line all the way until the bead touches the tip of your rod.  This makes sure you always have tight line even when you are not using the rod.  Also, do not break the rod down into two pieces for transport.  Loose wire line is disaster.  I use rods with roller guides for my wire set ups.  It is the way to go."
691138,Grimace,2012-04-29 11:57:00,2020,"Also, here are some pictures of the best knot too use to tie the swivel on the end of your line.   Don't forget the big bead.  http://www.lotsa.org/Wire%20Line%20Knot.htm  Also a video http://www.fishdoctorcharters.com/videos/video3W.html  Good luck."
