691361,Gregoire,2012-04-30 10:43:00,1397,"I have no experience with that particular store, but I almost always pay duty when purchasing baits from American retail stores. A good way to avoid taxes, and to pay cheaper postage is to get t=your purchase delivered to the states and to pick it up in the states yourself. A google search for ""ship to buffalo"" could give you some details."

691377,BillM,2012-04-30 13:04:00,17367,etackle.ca is another great choice!  Phil will take care of you.
691393,Henricus,2012-04-30 13:42:00,118,"All good choices but without criticizing other stores, the one I cited has something at 40% off any other place I have checked.  It's hard to pass that up when I was planning on buying 2."
691401,BillM,2012-04-30 14:05:00,17367,Make sure you add duty/brokerage and shipping to the overall price    If they don't ship USPS you'll REALLY get hammered with brokerage.  Goodluck!
