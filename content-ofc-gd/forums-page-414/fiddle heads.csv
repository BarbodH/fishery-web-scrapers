691291,Drock6687,2012-04-29 23:51:00,90,been reading about them in a couple postings here...was out trout fishing today and the shore around the creek was absolutely full of them...you eat them?
691294,ketchenany,2012-04-30 00:02:00,3229,Where we you fishing?  I have to find a place close to  Cookstown next year! Timing is of the essence in getting them! Misfish seem to be top dog here!
691301,Dave Bailey,2012-04-30 00:22:00,1641," Yep, they're early, unopened, fern fronds. Not for me though, veggies and I don't get along too well, all the water and fibre aggravate my IBS. But they are popular, here's a Wikipedia story about fiddleheads.  Looking at pictures you can see how they got their nickname.  "
691444,misfish,2012-04-30 15:52:00,29133,You can still get them. They are behind. Many clumps havent even started to sprout.  Im a weekend fiddler.
691488,blaque,2012-04-30 18:01:00,2419,"Im glad someone posted the question.....Im completely in the dark about this fiddlehead craze. Never heard of them outside of OFC.  So whats the deal, what do they taste like, how do you cook em, can you eat em raw in a salad, can i find them down here in new york?"

691612,Rattletrap2,2012-04-30 20:57:00,1652,"They are definitely behind this year. I have some up close to the house, but along the river they are not showing yet. Probably after this week though."
691620,misfish,2012-04-30 21:21:00,29133,"  Hi ya Mr.B.  I am finding the one,s that get the sun, are done now. Got to get in where the shade and cold nights are keeping them slow growing.  You know where the old tracks were on hwy 10?(oh that,s dating myself)LOL Thats where my pop took us all the time. Fish a bit,then fiddle hunt.Was a great long day."
