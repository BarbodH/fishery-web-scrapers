691403,Jer,2012-04-30 14:06:00,1426,"   ...and where exactly does it say that?  Though I agree, the shots in the grass of an OOS fish are in bad taste...not to mention the hat..."
691405,BillM,2012-04-30 14:06:00,17367,"Luckily this time of year the water is still cold, I'm sure that did zero harm to the fish..    Bass are pretty resilient."
691412,chuckymcd,2012-04-30 14:13:00,144," This topic has been brought up quite a bit over the time ive spent on this site.  I thought we all came to the conclusion that it is ok to snap a quick picture and release the fish.  That being said, the pics on the grass we probably could have done with out.  And the Hat is great BTW"
691417,Trevor0179,2012-04-30 14:25:00,65,Fish was out of the water for for less then a min I was fishing with an my eleven year old son it was biggest bass he had seen seen so he asked if we could take a picture if anyone one has a problem go fly a kite
