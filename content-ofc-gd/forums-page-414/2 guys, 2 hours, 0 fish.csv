Well, the warmest we could find was about 47Â° We tried shallow, we tried sheltered, we tried deep, we even tried live bait. Nada, not a single fish. Finally after two hours of not even getting a bite we decided to head back and just try to enjoy the sunshine and sit on the deck. Dinner is now in the oven and I'm going to have a well earned nap. Catching is lousy, life is good!"

691016,Jer,2012-04-28 23:51:00,1426,Fishing was tough today Cliff. My buddy and I managed a crappie each and a few little bluegill for a few hours effort. Lots more boats out today then I've seen so far this year but didn't see anybody really catching.
