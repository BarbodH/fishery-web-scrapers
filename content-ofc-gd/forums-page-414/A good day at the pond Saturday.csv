691168,aplumma,2012-04-29 13:31:00,6896,On a cool and overcast day I felt the strong pull to hit pond X. All in all there were lots of 1-3 lbers that came to the boat but these are some of the better fish of the day.   First fish was  on the second cast using a storm 3 inch live swimming lure     this one found a white frog to be his choice of breakfast    this picture doesn't do justice as to how big this ones mouth was.    A white spinner bait was the key to getting this one to the boat.   The tape measure on the side of the boat is from Lake Nippissing the red part is the slot limit for walleye. I wish the numbers were easier to read. None of the fish were weighted just a quick picture and back in the water to be enjoyed by others.    Art

691212,Rod Caster,2012-04-29 16:56:00,5784,"Since that's a Nip measuring tape, looks like the bass' tail is halfway into the slot zone, which puts it at 50 cms or around 20 inches.  Either way, I don't need a measurment, all those fish are a great catch by any standard!"
691663,Leecher,2012-04-30 22:58:00,7832,Good job Art  Looks like the green trouts were more than willing to come out to play     All caught on different baits Some good looking ones in them pics... AWESOME
