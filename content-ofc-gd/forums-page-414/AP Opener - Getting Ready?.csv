690373,mirogak,2012-04-26 19:42:00,387, Mike/Brad  What do guys think what the water temp will be like given the temp forecast for the next 3 days. Highs of 3 and 4 and lows of -6 and -4.  Miro
690375,BillM,2012-04-26 19:44:00,17367,Cold.
690379,Christopheraaron,2012-04-26 20:07:00,3525,"It won't affect the deeper lakes as much, but it could affect the bite on the surface."
690384,colin519,2012-04-26 20:19:00,101,"I'm going to Algonquin in a few weeks and I'm just bringing a small selection of my gear, but thats because my gear is mostly bass related. Going to try an ultralight spinning rod and a fly rod a bit.  Might try the 3 way swivel thing if it's warm but I think it'll still be cool enough to catch at a reasonable depth."
690385,solopaddler,2012-04-26 20:28:00,8605,"Hard to say for sure but I'd guess around 48 farenheit give or take.  Fortunately it will be sunny on Sat. Despite the coolish temps there will for sure be an afternoon bite, especially on the smaller shallower lakes."
690426,mirogak,2012-04-26 22:50:00,387,Yes - Sunday is even more sunnier and Monday warmer ... After that it is all uphill ....
690477,Sinker,2012-04-27 02:52:00,8692,"I just got back from 3 days of troutin outside of the park. The water was between 40-46 on the lakes we fished. Best action was in the afternoon, on the lake we found the warmest water.  We had horrible conditions, obviously. I'm already itching to go back up to redeem myself. I think it will still be a week or two before things really get going.  Good luck this weekend fella's!  S."
690487,Musky or Specks,2012-04-27 03:30:00,2710,Dang I've had to change my plans and can't get to the park this weekend. Just hitting some small streams in whatever spare time I have and AP will have to wait for next weekend now.
690522,Rod Caster,2012-04-27 12:02:00,5784,"That sucks Brad  My old man is making a trip a northern lake in AP. You'd swear this lake is void of life in the summer, but spring is a different story."
691352,mirogak,2012-04-30 05:40:00,387,"Just got back hugely disappointed ... No action. Good thing you didn't go Brad. They just weren't biting. Report to come later. Too tired now. I think in two weeks time, things will be different."
691522,Realsteel19,2012-04-30 18:51:00,19,Tried spinners for steel for the first time. Im hooked
689685,mirogak,2012-04-24 00:28:00,387,"Think I am ready from an inventory perspective ... nightcrawlers are the only thing remaining which I will pick on the way up there....  Now, if I can only lay my hands on this elusive creature.  Any additional suggestions?  Miro                        "
689691,Christopheraaron,2012-04-24 00:42:00,3525,Jigs always seem to produce there. Good luck!
689693,solopaddler,2012-04-24 00:49:00,8605,"Good selection! That btw isn't the cart from MEC that I was referring to.  This is the one: http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Paddling/CarRacksCarts/PRD~4015-488/wck-expedition-canoe-cart.jsp   If you're able to locate a couple of #2 copper E.G.B. spoons they work pretty good.  Some tiny diving shad raps in both perch and crawdad are also deadly at times.  Also something I always do is buy my worms beforehand, remove them from the dirt and pack them in worm bedding. Less messy, much lighter, and they stay livlier."
689699,mirogak,2012-04-24 01:02:00,387," You know Mike - I figured that out when you mentioned ""Cadillac of carts""  ... I went for the cheaper 100$ one ... I have been spending a bit too much.  I'll see how this goes and need be I can always upgrade.  Thx for the worm suggestion.  PS: As you can see, I am slowly also getting ready for a backcounty trip by mid-summer - just gotta get some light camping gear.  Ciao, Miro"
689701,Christopheraaron,2012-04-24 01:03:00,3525,And remember no live bait! Don't want to make the fishing too easy for you
689708,mirogak,2012-04-24 01:10:00,387, Yes of course - have too much respect for AP to do that.
689725,camillj,2012-04-24 02:21:00,1988,I dont see any white (with red dot) mooselooks in there ....or Mickey Finns ... or Montreal Darks
689728,SirCranksalot,2012-04-24 02:31:00,3291,If no live bait is allowed then worms aren't allowed.
689729,mirogak,2012-04-24 02:33:00,387," Hahahah love your signature ... that's what my dad tells me ""you never around on summer weekends .. where the hell are you boy!"""
689732,mirogak,2012-04-24 02:41:00,387, This what you mean    Ok - I'll keep it on my to-do list for next trip.
689737,BillM,2012-04-24 03:14:00,17367,"I love those zonkers, great for resident fish!  you definitely want some perch coloured shad raps!  killer for brookies."
689739,Paulus,2012-04-24 03:16:00,522," I took this advice a long time ago & can tell you that it's worth listening to. Excellent point as usual, Mike!  p.-"
689743,Ainsley,2012-04-24 03:39:00,142,"Great looking conehead zuddlers, I've been meaning to try tying some up. Those panther martin spinners should do well as well as the spoons. My fav spoons have been the Williams warblers and the EGB spoons."
689788,Realsteel19,2012-04-24 12:48:00,19,Those nymph and stone patterns are amazing. did you tie?
689794,solopaddler,2012-04-24 13:20:00,8605,Hardware     Flies       
689796,BillM,2012-04-24 13:23:00,17367,Mike those big giant floating bugs in the last box will work well in August
689798,solopaddler,2012-04-24 13:34:00,8605,"    BIG brookies like a big meal, these will work better.       "
689799,BillM,2012-04-24 13:37:00,17367,I need to order some of those!
689879,mirogak,2012-04-24 19:43:00,387,"Sorry Mike - that was too graphic for me ... please advise of x rating prior to posting  I am glad to see that what I am taking, you also have in your arsenal.  @real - no I did not tie those but I suspect that is going to become my next hobby.  Just waiting to build my new shed."
689880,mirogak,2012-04-24 19:44:00,387,"Hey Mike,  I noticed that you weren't packing any dry flies - do you think there won't be much action on the surface this time of the year?"
689881,solopaddler,2012-04-24 19:49:00,8605,"  The last small box is all dries, just in case. And no I'm not really expecting much surface action with this cool weather.  If there is it'll be a small window in the evening most likely."
689883,Christopheraaron,2012-04-24 19:49:00,3525, You see that last box? Bring a selection but dries should work well for the next while.
689923,mirogak,2012-04-24 22:05:00,387, Not sure how I missed that ... thx.
689999,SirCranksalot,2012-04-25 01:51:00,3291,"It's good to know that I'm not alone in taking a 'kitchen sink"" approach to taking lure etc on a fishing trip. But what I find is that I just use a handful of the 'tried and true' or 'lucky' ones even though I have a box full(or 2) to choose from. Anyone else do the same?"
690001,solopaddler,2012-04-25 01:58:00,8605,"  No Harold, I use them all."
