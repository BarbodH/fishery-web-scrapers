690870,Fishing 24/7,2012-04-28 12:34:00,709,  unlike the last 3 years the fish wernt tight to the trees on the opener usualy i will fish in the fallen trees but after a full round of the lake nothing hit.... then i was like 100 ' out from shore and casting in front of the drops and thats when they started to hit like crazy they would come straight from the deep and smash the lures in a second.   mepps black fury #1-2  small spoons that replicate a minnow.  worms.  its all good bud.  oh yeah and windy days RULE!  the fish arent spooked  and smash everything in there way.

691072,Leecher,2012-04-29 02:07:00,7832,"Kevin,  I see you're using Windows 7 live Movie Maker... Great added video effects in this version  But you must be more creative in the selection music side of things  I'm more incline to rock or hard rock or off the charts in new age for my choice of sounds but that's just me  Here's an excerpt of what I like    Enjoy"
