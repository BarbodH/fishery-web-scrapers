691143,Nipfisher,2012-04-29 12:15:00,2449, 1st thing I thought when I saw the picture. That's what I would do.
691172,aplumma,2012-04-29 13:45:00,6896,Redrilling will raise it higher and it's ability to read will be compromised. You will need to redrill the mount lower. You can try to drill the shaft from the top then take a cabinet screw with a square shank head. Drill thru both sides of the top mounting ring and down thru the shaft. Drill the hole slightly smaller than the screw except in the top of the ring slightly larger than the micro head on the screw. Then screw thru the ring to the bottom so the bolt can be replaced. Use a water proof epoxy on the face of the crack before you screw together and let dry. If this fails the transponder you have can be purchased on line for around $65.00 good luck with the repair I hope it holds.   Art
691184,mercman,2012-04-29 15:02:00,7054,"We spend hundreds and even thousands on fishing equipment every dang year.There is no way that can be fixed properly enough to risk ruining a days fishing. It may hold for a week or a month, but it WILL fail someday when you are counting on it the most. Buy a new one, and get fishing Cut the cable at the transducer,tape the new cable really good to the old one, and use the old cable like a fiche to route the new cable to its destination."
691192,Tybo,2012-04-29 15:25:00,1373,Broke one like that years ago.Did what Art says with some gorilla glue.sold the boat four years later and it was still intacked. I used a sheet metal screw.higher threads.
691344,marrex_mike,2012-04-30 03:44:00,40,I can't tell if your boat is glass or aluminum? If it's fiberglass you can apoxy the transducer to the bottom of the hull on the inside of the boat..in which case you wouldn't need to buy a new one or fix that one.. Google it and I'm sure you will find instructions on how exactly it's done.
691436,doubleheader,2012-04-30 15:16:00,497, I broke one very simiarly 3 years ago and glued it together with a 2 part epoxy. It hasn't failed yet.
691052,rob v,2012-04-29 01:21:00,535,"So today I'm replacing my bilge pump and while doing that I knock my transducer by accident with my knee... and you guessed it - busted the darn thing.  Not a happy camper.   The arm/elbow that holds the transducer body to the bracket cracked in two.  It's a plastic arm that just snapped. Transducer body is fine.  So now I'm trying to figure out how to fix it without replacing the darn thing.   I was hoping to glue the two pieces back together    Any suggestions ?  I'm thinking some crazy glue or contact cement, but I'm hoping someone else out there has experienced the same thing and can provide me with the benefit of their experience."
691055,Sinker,2012-04-29 01:24:00,8692,"I did the same thing with the lawn mower. Was cutting the grass and just knocked it right off.  Buy a new one. I couldn't get it to stay together. Well, I did....but it always broke again when I needed it most. It was more frustrating than anything!   S."
691056,mrpike,2012-04-29 01:24:00,151,
691059,aplumma,2012-04-29 01:27:00,6896,Sorry I got to vote for replacement. The composite plastics are tough to get bonded together. The good news is they are generally less than $100.00.   Art
691060,mrpike,2012-04-29 01:28:00,151,"Sorry to tell you this but I think you are done like dinner on fixing that one,  I have tryed to glue them with no luck at all. soon as I gun the boat BANG !!! its gone again. I wish you luck."
691063,irishfield,2012-04-29 01:30:00,26272,I'd have to see where and how it was broken.. but considering a $100 plus replacement I'd be workin on a $2 solution!
691065,aplumma,2012-04-29 01:41:00,6896," That easy to say when you got a machine shop in the back yard. lol  You have the same problem I have here on the farm when someone tells me that its broken I find myself saying ""challenge accepted"" then spending $200.00 for the tool to fix it because you can never have to many tools.    Art"
691076,rob v,2012-04-29 02:13:00,535,  I'm with you Wayne -   here's a pci - not sure how well you can see it - but  
691077,mercman,2012-04-29 02:14:00,7054,Show us a picture. I bet one of us can come up with a solution  
691080,rob v,2012-04-29 02:25:00,535,not sure how this might look... but   
691082,ah_long,2012-04-29 02:26:00,354,You should just buy mine and keep the busted one as a spare...
691083,Terry,2012-04-29 02:26:00,14456,"I will bet it's a pretty easy fix, but it may not look pretty when you're done a photo or 2 would help"
691087,irishfield,2012-04-29 02:27:00,26272, Oh.. you've seen my work before!!!
691102,SlowPoke,2012-04-29 03:04:00,2984, That'll teach ya for mounting a transducer on your lawn mower!
691104,Skipper D,2012-04-29 03:15:00,1970,where do you find glue that works in water ?????????  
691106,mercman,2012-04-29 03:18:00,7054,"  Ya have to take it out of the water, then let the glue dry before putting it back in the water. Silly little man"
691108,Bob,2012-04-29 03:23:00,370,There is a two part crazy glue or super glue that's designed for hard plastic. The first part is a prep thing and the second part is the actual glue. I've only ever used it once but it worked fine for what I was using it on. Don't remember what that was either. Might be worth a look?
691110,Sinker,2012-04-29 03:32:00,8692,"I tried all kinds of glues, and epoxies, but they never held up. Hot glue actually held up the longest. I ended up using that transducer for my ice graph, and put a new one on the boat.  S."
691114,mike rousseau,2012-04-29 03:44:00,4661,Well.... Might be a long shot... But if your gunna toss it anyways... Try melting both sides a bit and put it back together... Should make a strong weld I would think...
691127,Skipper D,2012-04-29 09:39:00,1970,"click on picture to see , you can't ruin it .... so drill a new hole , put the bolt back thru it , you might have to shim up both sides with barb type flat washers to keep it locked in place ."
691128,blue pickeral,2012-04-29 09:52:00,267,"It's not on the side of the tube, but I'd try using Lepages PLP construction adhesive. Used it on all kinds of materials, including building up layers on the inside of a cracked and leaking toilet tank (dried out and glue built up to 1/4 inch or so)and it has worked magnificently. Perhaps using a 'plastic' glue for the joining surfaces of the crack to hold together, then building an exterior layer with the PLP will give it the strength the bond needs to survive boat speeds in water."
691131,Billy Bob,2012-04-29 10:40:00,5865,"If this is a glass boat, mount it inside the boat."
691133,whiskywizard,2012-04-29 11:05:00,305,"I'd attempt a $5 repair before I replaced it.  I'd use one of the kneaded epoxies.  Like this. Available at all marine stores, big box building stores and Canadian Tire   And I'd drill small matching holes in the broken faces of the 2 parts and dowel them with a steel dowel made from cutting a common nail. Add extra epoxy around the exterior of the neck of the break to build up some extra support."
691134,rob v,2012-04-29 11:43:00,535,wow - some great ideas - thanks.
691139,misfish,2012-04-29 12:03:00,29133,"  Yep what BB said.  Find a spot on the hull near the transom. Clean and give a light sanding and whip the dust away. Take a small container like a small sour cream plastic container. Cut the bottom out. Place the container on the spot,fill with 2 parts epoxsy. Push the transducer into it."
