690513,limeyangler,2012-04-27 11:35:00,5204,"Hi all,   Me again...lol.   Went out for some lakers today. With the water temps hovering just above 40 degrees F i spent the first hour and a half trolling the shallows with a variety of rigs/jigs/spoons and hardbaits.....with only a pike to show for it. I then spent another hour checking out deeper water with no reward. I decided to get some relief and targeted bass on a spot i know....they were there in numbers!  Jig and minnow did the damage. They were in 14'FOW behind a windswept shaol. Man....the wind was relentless today......all i can say is that the I-pilot did its job flawlessly again....i really cant sing it's praises enough....i have not even used the track record feature....spot lock is like having a guide in the boat every trip....held me on the spot within feet of where i wanted for a whole hour in 25kmh head on winds!!! Battery was still at 80% when i got home.   Best of all was i hooked into a trout casting a jig and minnow for bass in 12'FOW...supper accomplished too! Great little session, bleedin' freezin'....did not get much above 4 Degrees C.    <iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/AXj153pKM7g"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>                       "

690551,johnnyb,2012-04-27 13:28:00,3413,"Nice work!  I've had trouble locating the trout, water temps the same...low 40's.  Only one I found was.....next to a couple bass I caught   My bass were out of season down here in the sowth....so they didn't count fer nuttin"
690557,limeyangler,2012-04-27 13:34:00,5204,  Nope....line twited around it on the way in.    Yeah.....was a tough morning till i decided to break for Bass. I think the way the shoal was located/wind direction made a perfect ambush point.  Yeah...i am lucky to have a year round bass season JB...not complaining one bit.
690580,Rod Caster,2012-04-27 15:03:00,5784,"Stacked, hungry and legal bass in the early spring? Simon, you successfully jealousized a lot of people here."

690804,Moosebunk,2012-04-28 01:57:00,3970,"That's one skinny looking spring laker Simon... but at 22 inches thereabouts, a goody!  Good fishing dood."

690989,Leecher,2012-04-28 21:58:00,7832,Good job in switching to plan B Simon    Looks like the bass were stacked up in that 14FOW   Bronzeback are a riot to catch on a jig  I see that it was windy and cold up your way    Had the same over here yesterday without the sun poking thru    At least there was no ice on the lakes I targeted  Again good job  and thanks for sharing!

691151,limeyangler,2012-04-29 12:45:00,5204,"  Thanks Jacques.....sorry dude....finding it hard not to say 'Leechy'. I really gave myself a hard time for not being able to stick at the trolling till i found them....but i quit beating myself up after the first bass.....lol. My trout was skinny as a supermodel though...a bit like the one you got there the other day too, weird.      Cheers Paul, you mention heaven....lol....well i aint quite there yet....hopefully thats where i am heading though...hehehe     Thanks Mike, i think i am getting to the point where a go pro would be handy......its really hard to film all this stuff some days."
