691307,Gerry,2012-04-30 00:33:00,257,"Now that's terrible. The water isn't very deep there, its a shallow ramp. Its mind boggling why the occupants couldn't have gotten out."
691309,BillM,2012-04-30 00:39:00,17367,How do you miss that stop and caution sign??  They must have been moving.
691315,DRIFTER_016,2012-04-30 00:52:00,10439,  Could be a DUI as well. Guess it will be known when the autopsies are done.
