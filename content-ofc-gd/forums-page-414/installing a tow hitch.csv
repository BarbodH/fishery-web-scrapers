691215,kickingfrog,2012-04-29 17:54:00,8333,"So the plan is to get a gently used vehicle that will be used to haul our expanding family around and tow a boat. Where does someone get a hitch installed besides the dealer? It will be a 7 passenger suv.  I'm sure I've seen it discussed here previously, but I couldn't find it in my searches.  Thanks guys."
691216,Fishnwire,2012-04-29 18:06:00,983,"I hear U-haul does it.  In Sudbury there's a place called Larry's Service Centre that works on trailers and tow vehicles only...maybe where you are there's a similar outfit.  I'd try the local yellow pages under ""trailers"".  My dad had it done at CTC, but he bought the hitch there...probably whoever sells you the hitch can do it or at least point you in the right direction.  I'd get one that is removable...it'll save you banging your shins into it when you don't need it.  Take it off and lock it up inside the truck when it's not in use...otherwise it might go missing."
691218,workwear,2012-04-29 18:19:00,592,any mechanic shop will do it.....my mechanic installed mine for free....4 bolts and taaa-daaaa
691219,ccmtcanada,2012-04-29 18:19:00,7971,"I find U-haul is about as cheap as it gets and they do a good job at the one on Taunton in Oshawa.  In fact, I'll be making an appt there very soon for a new class II hitch."
691220,misfish,2012-04-29 18:26:00,29133,Check your pm for local.
691222,kickingfrog,2012-04-29 18:35:00,8333,"Thanks guys. U-haul rings a bell. Thanks for the pm Brian, I will shop around."
691228,mistaredone,2012-04-29 19:26:00,913,Hitch city in GTA or Barrie. U haul sounds scary.
691230,ccmtcanada,2012-04-29 19:44:00,7971,I've had a few done at U Haul and watched as they installed everything and they are very efficient at it.  I've never had issues with their hitches.  Takes less than an hour...wiring included.
691256,Billy Bob,2012-04-29 21:35:00,5865,Buy one somewhere and put the thing on yourself....not much harder then hooking on the boat in the morning...
691284,waso,2012-04-29 23:22:00,44, Hitch factory on the mountain in hamilton.  They do the installs for lots of dealers.  I just went direct to them and they were half the price for a Class 3 hitch.
691302,SlowPoke,2012-04-30 00:24:00,2984,"Any RV dealer should be able to set you up. Avoid ""universal"" hitches if you can. I wouldn't go to U-Haul for the same reason I wouldn't go to Jiffy Lube."
691303,Raf,2012-04-30 00:27:00,3495,i think many 7 psngr SUVs come with a tow package anyway so it may be a moot point.   u-haul did mine on my old jeep.
691306,dave524,2012-04-30 00:33:00,4508,"bought a trailer years ago and recently had these guys put a hitch on a new vehicle, getting too old to crawl underneath they know their stuff  http://hitchmantrailers.ca/catalog/"
691311,lovetofish,2012-04-30 00:44:00,500,"Not a big deal where you go, pretty easy to do!  You would have to a moron to screw that up"
691331,GoneFishin,2012-04-30 01:59:00,349,"I put one on my old gmc. Went to the junk yard and picked one up for 40 bucks, 4 bolts later and she was on there snug."
691360,Skipper D,2012-04-30 10:39:00,1970,You can always get it done here if its the best OFC member deal your looking for .
691374,Ainsley,2012-04-30 12:42:00,142,"I've heard the u-haul hitches are made by curt, who in turn makes some of the nicest setups. I have a curt on my forester and am very happy with it. The install is super easy as others have mentioned. Check out etrailer dot com for pricing and some really good video tutorials."
691419,ccmtcanada,2012-04-30 14:33:00,7971,Ainsley....those videos are great!  Thanks for posting the website.
691463,ricoboxing,2012-04-30 17:00:00,398,"I bought a uhaul hitch, and got my friend to do it. I had some rust so I couldn't bolt it on with a wrench, needed air tools. Don't 4get the wiring kit. That's probably a little harder to do then the hitch."
