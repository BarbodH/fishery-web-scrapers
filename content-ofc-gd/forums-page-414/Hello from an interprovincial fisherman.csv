I have also worked in Terrace Bay Ontario in 1981, I was in Pembroke for studies in 1983-1984 & loved the Algonquin Park hoping to go back there this summer with my son. I have a 14 foot aluminium boat & a 20 hp motor, a project fiberglass boat of 13.5 ft no motor tought I gave it to my uncle. I am also a deer hunter.  I am in numerous fishing & hunting forums, so do not be surprised if you do not see me often on this forum."
