690995,waterwolf,2012-04-28 22:21:00,556,"turned out better than i thought possible. my new hunting partner i and met up and exchanged plans for the morning hunt. as soon as we get out of our trucks , gobbler fires up. he went north ,me south. last years corn stubble is sticking out a bit ,but a real good field to set up as birds are noticeable as they peek over the hump in the field to check things out.i started with a light yelp ,then clucked a bit.. 15 minutes, that tom ran straight at me stopped at  the decoy and stayed in strut way too long. patience ,, gone. it couldn't have gone any better.didn't have a chance  to weigh it but was told for sure over 20 lbs. 40 yds '3in mag. remington express pump did it's job. got a few pictures , just been a while since i,ve posted any . i'm on it."

691111,Sinker,2012-04-29 03:34:00,8692,"Sounds like a 2 year old to me. Could be a 3 year old, but more than likely 2.  S."
691118,waterwolf,2012-04-29 03:51:00,556,"how do i know, what should i be looking for?"
691119,Sinker,2012-04-29 03:57:00,8692,"Lenght of spurs, length of beard, and the tail feathers.  I'm simply judging by the length of spurs. He could be a 3 year old, but I'm betting on 2.  If it was a 1 year old, he would just have little nubby spurs. If he was 3 they should be over an inch.  Sounds like you guys already got the boss tom, and this guy was looking for his turn at some action!  Keep in mind, none of this is exact science!  S."
691120,waterwolf,2012-04-29 04:25:00,556,"at least 4 gobblers still in the area ! honestly , i've been dealt a great hand here.our field then a long field in front ,, then a long strip of woods . 6 maybe 700 yards. birds fired up all along the edge but won't commit. but that's after 2 shots fired so morning may be different.i'm gonna move my set-up, call a little different an try to flirt with these big boys."
