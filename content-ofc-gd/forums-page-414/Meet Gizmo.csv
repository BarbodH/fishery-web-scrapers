691049,Leecher,2012-04-29 01:15:00,7832, Cute doesn't cut it... after looking again.... he's adorable   I'm sure he'll bring you lots of joy in the years to come
691051,GBW,2012-04-29 01:17:00,8460,"ummmm,any dog can be trained, but it's the owners job to do it, not the dogs."
691058,puncho,2012-04-29 01:26:00,6,"  We tried but he was already 1 year & a half old & came with his bad habits too, what may not have helped I guess is t we where act that we were not at home enough too, me & my wife had dogs before too & never had that problem before, it was like 2 months we had it when we made the decision we could not keep him, now we have a cat & she is litter trained."
691061,misfish,2012-04-29 01:29:00,29133,Right on Geoff
691112,bassman87,2012-04-29 03:39:00,586,cute pup

691198,misfish,2012-04-29 15:38:00,29133,Oh I see you have a MAN dog.   And I have been corrected.  Giz is a Bichon Yorkie.
691199,asdve23rveavwa,2012-04-29 15:41:00,2690,You just got two giant AWWWWWWWWWW'S here.  Giz is too cute!
691201,mercman,2012-04-29 15:45:00,7054,"Hello Gizmo!  Now, you listen to Uncle Paul. Daddy likes to fish the rivers and streams, OK? You tell him to get one of those shoulder type bags, big enough for you to ride in, so he can take you with him, and he can teach you all about them little trouty things he calls fish .....Got it?"
691203,misfish,2012-04-29 15:55:00,29133,"Remember when you brought your new born home??????  Up at any hour. Boy there were some memories returned.  I know it will get better,,,,,,,,,,  Now he has his own little area. Yep,growing again BB.   "
691214,Twocoda,2012-04-29 17:27:00,4130,heres some sleeping/growing music for Gizmo  
691225,Billy Bob,2012-04-29 19:02:00,5865,If you want to keep the dog from growing....keep it awake as much as possible and when it's awake give it cigarettes....it will stunt their growth....LOL...
691226,misfish,2012-04-29 19:11:00,29133," Thanks Dave,I knew I should of turned the speakers down."
691229,NAW,2012-04-29 19:44:00,4022,AWESOME!!!  I was wondering when I would see a post like this from you!!  Reminds me a lot of Riley when she was a pup.  Before she turned white.      
691231,Big Cliff,2012-04-29 19:48:00,6899,"I'll see your Giz and raise you two spastic beagles!  Actually I don't think any home is complete without a dog in it and I wouldn't trade Mandy for anything, she is actually starting to turn out to be a good dog! Glad to see you got one too!"
691359,motv8tr,2012-04-30 10:39:00,2587,"cute little pup Brian, I'm sure he'll be a great companion for many years....  Maureen"
691364,bigugli,2012-04-30 11:29:00,6138,"Just wait until the pup discovers the taste of fish. The moment I start warming the pan, the dogs are in the  kitchen wrapped around my feet. So far, Casey has not made an attempt at stealing from the table."
691458,fishingwithbob,2012-04-30 16:34:00,123,"  Ya, that was probably worked out best for the dog.  Hopefully he went to a home that could take care of him.  Cute pup Brian, enjoy"
691475,misfish,2012-04-30 17:35:00,29133,"Seems the little fella has a touch of kennel cough. Im surprised, as he came from a purebreed breeder.Vet says he,ll be fine in a day or two.No worries. A= check up other then that."
691572,Moosebunk,2012-04-30 20:18:00,3970,Ahhhh cute little ankle biter that one.
691685,FisherJuli,2012-04-30 23:40:00,125,"That is a cute puppy indeed! Frank showed me the pics already, but I had to jump on myself to say awwwwww!!"
690909,misfish,2012-04-28 16:55:00,29133,"While I was fishing today,the mrs,s sends a txt. Look what I got today. OH OH   Get home,and there he was. I just looked at him and said,welcome to your new home. Memories of cuddles rushed through me,and it was kinda emotional.  He hops over to me,gives me the sniff over and looks up.  Betty didnt name him yet,she let me do the honor.    GIZMO          He,s got lots of character."
690911,Beans,2012-04-28 17:11:00,3339,"Reminds me of when Maribeth and Maureen met me at the bus stop with this mangy piece of scruff...Riley !!!  All I could ask was ""Why didn't you get a real dog ""      I came to love him after time...and was quite upset when we had to have him put down...he had a good home for over ten years..."
690920,lovetofish,2012-04-28 17:44:00,500,Cute lookin pup. Wouldn't trade my dog for the world!
690921,lew,2012-04-28 17:47:00,12766,Cute little pup Brian and you'll give him as good a home and make him as welcome to your family as Cuddles.  I think Gizmo looks like Marvin when he was a pup  
690922,bigugli,2012-04-28 17:52:00,6138,"I see you two got bit by the puppy bug after visiting with Casey last week  Sure looks like a cute little fella. He'll grow on you real quick, too"

690931,lew,2012-04-28 18:16:00,12766," So is Marvin Brian and your in for a real treat, their absolutely fantastic dogs and as friendly and loving as any pooch you'll ever find.  Betty made a great choice !!"

690977,Leecher,2012-04-28 21:26:00,7832,"Cute little pup Brian!  Gizmo, fitting name"
691042,misfish,2012-04-29 01:06:00,29133,"  The name came to me right away,as soon as I seen his face.Been a great an exciting day,to say the least."
691044,misfish,2012-04-29 01:09:00,29133," He ain,t the man dog Ryan,,but,Giz seems to think he is.LOL"
691045,Joeytier,2012-04-29 01:09:00,3990,Shoulda named him stinger...
691046,puncho,2012-04-29 01:12:00,6,We had one similar about 6 months ago but had to returned to the SPCA because he was not clean at all & destroyed numerous items in the house his name was Gamik :   I must admit I was a bit sad of the outcome.
