690983,Grimace,2012-04-28 21:35:00,2020,"   So why are the people that are not contributing anything to the foundation trying to rip them you ask?  A.  No one is ripping.   Just asking questions.  Questions that can be easily answered at that.  B.  Don't you think it is a little presumptuous of you to assume the people here who have questions are people who are not giving? or as you put it ""not giving a dime"".  Quite a few cheques (canadian spelling) have made it OFAH's way from me, not that I need to state that to qualify my concerns and questions as a member.  I do not mean any disrespect but I can't have you suggest that myself (or anyone else in this thread for that matter) are non contributors or don't pay a dime.  I can not sit here and have you suggest that we are ""tearing into"" the OFAH either.  Just questions.  I am also very mildly curious as to why you felt so moved as to rip into the people in this thread, as you say, you have no real interest in it.   Anyways, it is quite clear that the OFAH is choosing not to respond.  This evasiveness about the actual numbers of the lottery raises eyebrows.  I think if the lottery was in fact making money the OFAH would have just stated that and shown the numbers.  We will see I suppose."
690986,Grimace,2012-04-28 21:43:00,2020,"  And for the record, I viewed my membership to the OFAH (and still do to a certain degree) very much as Carp stated he feels about his membership. It was at this point in the thread where I was eager to hear the OFAH's response and was quite disappointed in the apparent 'snow job' that was being given in response.  I am sorry if that upsets you."
691054,aplumma,2012-04-29 01:24:00,6896,"Simply said if someone don't feel they are getting what they want from the program or it is not using your money effectively  Grimace ( I am answering your question not singling you out) then don't contribute. If this was a mandatory pay association that you could not opted out on then sure you got a beef and it should be answered.  A. The information is there and there are 3 ways listed for you to get it. The company does not have the time to come on and have a sit down and provide it to you in the format that you requested simple enough to read. If they do take the time and expense to do this will someone hold a witch hunt because of the accountants fees?  B. Actually if you support something financially why would you not also support it whole heartily? If the local church is not doing good things with my money should I still give it to them? (no) People who voluntarily give funds to a program that they mistrust which is what a few of you all are saying in different wordings need to not support it and give up the right to complain/question/ grump what ever word they use. Then they will become the people who get the benefit with out spending a dime.  No disrespect is taken your opinion is yours to have...as well is mine. The view I have of this is drawing on by my background in business as a business owner, a fund raiser, a coordinator of events and even a moderator on a few forums on the internet. So far some of the members are getting edgy because a major company has not taken the time on a weekend to get the accountants/legal department/public relations to address a question on a small public forum... how dare they.....   The answer to your mild curiosity is the same answer to this question Why did I join a board in Canada which is 8 hours away 14 years ago? Then drive 6 times + for 14 hours a year to visit with members. Spending over $ 1000.00 a year to fish and camp and enjoy the wonderful outdoors you have. Then average 12 hours a week on the board giving of my free time and money to keep this board running. If you haven't guessed the answer it because I love Canada it is the best neighbor I could ever ask for. I love the resources you have with the fishing and the availability of waters that all can fish.   Finally the Snow job as it has been called.... give them a break it the weekend one of the members has already taken the time to give you a place to get the answers to the general question of where does the money go? Now if you are serious about wanting to get an answer take some time off of work go to the headquarters and sit down with there accounting department. Remembering that someone has to pay for the time they are talking to you. If anyone shows me those two sacrifices then I will feel then that they are serious about wanting an answer that as of this thread never entered their mind.  Grimace I am not upset if I came across as that I apologize. I however am dishearten at how fast some people have started questioning/ accusing in a round about way that an organization is ducking the question on a weekend because the answer was not immediately forth coming for free with no effort on their part.   For future reference I think my deeds and actions to many members and friends I have proven that I care about both Canada and the people that live there and have every right to participate in discussions both as a participant and as a Moderator of this forum.  As I wrote this I may have used the word ""you"" ""we"" ""they"" they are not meant personally but should be read as non specific unless a specific name was used.   Art"
691073,chessy,2012-04-29 02:09:00,610,"aplumma You may not be aware but the OFAH is mandatory in some parts for instance hunting certain county forest require Mandatory ofah memberships. to belong to most gun clubs requires mandatory ofah memberships , when you ask for a copy of the ofah insurance policy you are told you are not allowed to see the policy .So your first statement about not being mandatory when in fact it is in some areas. The ofah came to this board and danced there way around the question when a simple answer  could have be made  yes it made a profit or no it  did not . as far as being a member and complaining, i am a tax payer of ontario and i pay lots of taxes when the provincial and federal government give them 1.9million a year then it is every ones business  where they spend there money !! I despise the ofah but this is not a lynch mob this is all about accountability to the tax payers of ontario  and to the members of the OFAH"
691088,Grimace,2012-04-29 02:29:00,2020," I guess that would be my question going forward would it not?  And yes you are singling me out.   Not correct.  This is not a volunteer program, this is an organization run by a dozen (give or take) people that are paid a very nice amount of money to make decisions as to what we must focus our efforts on and how we should spend the money that is raised (if any....) The volunteers of which you speak are people like yours truly (not the ingrates you have suggested we are) the members who sell the tickets and buy the tickets, and do things for our local clubs.  The people we (the members and volunteers) are asking the questions of are well paid and not as you have suggested, volunteers.   What is this babble?  Do you really think people should mindlessly throw their money into something with not ever being allowed to question/direct/have an opinion on.  I have no interest in discussing your local church as it has no place here.  OFAH is not a religion, I do not have to have blind ""faith"" in it without question.  I have not been throwing my money into a program which I mistrust.  I trusted it, until now.  I have questions that should be easily answered.   My question was not why you were so moved as to join a fishing board in Canada.  My question was why you were so moved as to 'rip' members of a club for asking questions of that club when you made a point of stating that it didn't have much to do with you.  I never questioned your integrity or reasoning for being a member or moderator on this board.     The wallbash icon would either indicate that you were upset or that you think that the people who have asked the questions here are profoundly unwarranted.    I am not complaining about a snow job in the sense that they have not took the time to reply on a weekend (it wasn't the weekend yesterday).  My complaint is with the fact that the reply given was a non reply.  They will not answer the simple question - Does the OFAH lottery lose money?  It is not, as you suggest ""where does the money go"" question.  That question can't be answered or asked until we know if there is any money to begin with.  As to your sacrifice comment, no, I am not taking a day off work to drive 4 hours to Peterborough on the slight chance that maybe they will be a little more forthcoming.  I have a family to raise and time is of a premium.  After 12 hour days and my commute home, I am lucky just to say good night to my wife and have a peek in at my little one.    I do not doubt that for a moment.  I never suggested otherwise.   My beef is that you would make false claims and try to create an environment where I would not be taken seriously in a discussion only as a participant and not a moderator of this forum.   You did single me out.  I have done nothing untoward here.  I have not been disingenuous in any way.  I have not used any hyperbole to try to make any points (which I don't have, just questions).  If you feel that I have broken the rules of this forum than (as you know) you can ban me.  But I do not think that you should so easily discount my questioning of an organization that I belong to."
691097,Mike the Pike,2012-04-29 02:54:00,3421,I have previously supported this organization in the past even though I live in La Belle Province.  I would like to purchase tickets myself but the rules state I must be in the province of Ontario  in order to purchase tickets.  does any one know if I can buy these tickets somewhere near ottawa as I travel to Gatineau and ottawa for work.  Peterbough is just too far for me.   MTP
691115,Sinker,2012-04-29 03:45:00,8692," Oh, I'm pretty sure they would find a way to take your money, Mike!  I""m going to wait till after the weekend to read a response.  I have heard of other ""fundraisers"" put on by ofah, where OFAH ends up with more money than the charity they are raising money for. How does that work?  For the record, I am no longer a member. I have my reasons, and I won't bring them up in this thread, but they are with warrant.  S."

691751,Roy,2012-05-01 01:33:00,13728,Wow.
691771,John Bacon,2012-05-01 02:15:00,3277, Do you want to be able to collect your prize if you win? That may be an issue if you win... especially if it is one of the larger prizes. If you know someone in Ontario then you could probably have lottery tickets sent to their address.
691772,Mike the Pike,2012-05-01 02:23:00,3421, John read the rules! I am allowed to win the prizes but the rules state I must purchase the tickets  in Ontario.  Si if I was to purchase in Ontario there would be no issue.At this point I don't think I will go out of my way to try and win a nice prize as the odds are not in my favor.  MTP
690692,ofah,2012-04-27 20:24:00,3,"The OFAH would like to provide the following clarifications:  The OFAH compensated 99 persons over the course of 2010; the $2.3 million payroll covered all salaries, benefits and mandatory employment expenses (e.g. CPP, EI, WSIB, EHT, etc.) related to those employment opportunities.  The OFAH Conservation Centre and the OFAH|Mario Cortellucci Hunting & Fishing Heritage Centre were built on land donated by an OFAH member near the banks of the Otonabee River. Each building was entirely financed using funds donated expressly for that purpose. No membership fees were used in the construction of these facilities.  The OFAH Conservation Lottery is the largest fundraiser for the Federation, with all proceeds (net of the fundraising costs) directed to approved fish and wildlife programs in current and future years. We are required, under the terms of our provincial lottery licence, to ensure that, over time, no net proceeds are left unspent. Members are welcome to opt out of selling lottery tickets by contacting our office, and all members are entitled to request complete audited financial statements by calling us at 705-748-6324.  The 2011 OFAH Annual Report is a public document that is available at www.ofah.org/report.  Additional questions may be directed to [email protected]"
690698,Roy,2012-04-27 20:46:00,13728,Thank you. Sounds clear to me.
690702,Grimace,2012-04-27 20:55:00,2020,  I was hoping the OFAH would clarify.  That statement doesn't say much of anything.   It just points everyone back to the annual report.
690703,kickingfrog,2012-04-27 20:59:00,8333,That is what's referred to as a political answer.
690706,Sinker,2012-04-27 21:13:00,8692,I call it beating around the bush.  Or Bull.  S.
690708,Roy,2012-04-27 21:35:00,13728,"Then I guess that those of us who are members can get the financial statements and take it from there. I must say that I find it a little disheartening that the strongest/only voice that Ontario outdoors people have is being attacked by the very people who could be working with them to make things better. But hey, that's just my opinion."
690711,Grimace,2012-04-27 21:50:00,2020,With all due respect Roy questions are not attacks.  The question of what the actual numbers of the lottery are could be easily answered here.  I didn't see anything wrong with Fisher asking for some clarification nor did I see anything wrong with people chiming in with their interest in hearing an answer.  The non answer is raising questions.  I plan on phoning the number and seeing what I get but I am not very optimistic because the OFAH seems evasive.
690712,Roy,2012-04-27 21:59:00,13728,"Grimace, I understand your point completely and my choice of words was probably not the best. What I'm saying is, financial statements are available to members and it would most likely be in the best interest of outdoors people to try to work with the federation not against. I'll stay out of this, I just thought another opinion wouldn't hurt."
690715,irishfield,2012-04-27 22:11:00,26272, Knowing how to read a P & L would probably help some folks as well Roy!
690718,Grimace,2012-04-27 22:18:00,2020,I totally get what your saying as well Roy.  This whole subject has perked my ears up a bit that's all.  I have been a happy member for years and have no interest in any crusade against the OFAH (as you undoubtedly have no interest in hosting such an event) I was just hoping for a bit more of a satisfying answer.  Looks like I will have to get it the hard way.
690722,Grimace,2012-04-27 22:28:00,2020," I'm not dumb, just busy lol  :-).  We have been pullIng 12's at work for over a month now. I was hoping the dude would just post the lottery info and end it.  Checking on this site with the iPhone is easier than digging through pages of rubble trying to find the buried info in between lifts at work.  Like I said, this has piqued my interest now and I am going to request the lottery info if I ever get some time.  Edit: typo. Again...."
690723,irishfield,2012-04-27 22:30:00,26272,  Wasn't directed at you Dave.. or anyone in general. Most people can't read or understand a P & L Statement. I'd be interested to see how a lottery costs more money to put on than it brings in as well and be billed as their major fund raiser.
690737,Grimace,2012-04-27 22:53:00,2020,I get ya Wayne.  I didn't really take it that way anyhow.  That's why I put the smiley face thingy there.
690749,SirCranksalot,2012-04-27 23:33:00,3291, No kidding. What a snow job!! Seems to me that if OFAH wants to get more people on their side they would be a bit more forthcoming with straight answers.

So this volunteer program is giving from what I read a powerful voice in the management of the resources in Canada. Why are the people that are not contributing anything to the foundation trying to rip them and if you are just cancel your unhappy membership? You are getting the benefit of what they do to improve the sportsman and environment in Canada and not paying a dime.  If you want better than what they are doing be the solution before you tear into the best answer you got right now.

Outreach does happen on-site, at the Hunting and Fishing Heritage Centre and the Shimano Fishing Pond.

689947,chessy,2012-04-24 23:34:00,610," Well chris. yes you get what you pay for .. your anual report says nothing about profit from lottery just the number of tickets sold. on the paper work i have it breaks down the lottery and other fundrasiers and the lottery was at a loss last year .. i would suggest you go to head office and ask for yourself  and come back here and say in a public fourm that i am WRONG ... again for a proper assessment call revenue canada and get the paper work and see who is wrong.. and i say again the lottery was  run at a loss AND one more thing every other fundraiser you have you list the profit, but never mentioned the profit/LOSS of the lottery that should send alarms off on ever person that reads it."
690025,fisher,2012-04-25 12:09:00,451,"After speaking to my dad about the Lottery and that he is not on the hook for the money, he said he may just buy the tickets next year (as long as he receioves them), but now after hearing that the Lottery is really losing money, I may have him reconsider.  So, I reviewed the 88 page report as Chris suggested but cannot locate anything about the profit/loss of the Lottery specifically.  The only thing I do see is the net fundraising for 2011 was $136,254 on the financial statements (but this appears to be for all fundrasing activities).  A breakdown of each fundrasing event would be more telling.  The report does also say 413,000 tickets were sold but, again, no breakdown of the expenses.  Also, if you are raising close to $800,000 in ticket sales for the Lottery (I believe it is $2 each ticket), how can the net fundraising amount only be $136,254 for ALL fundraising activities (and there are a few of them)?  I'd be curious for the actual numbers.  Chessy, can you not post the line by line numbers of what you have from Rev Canada?"
690162,Roy,2012-04-25 22:07:00,13728,I've been convinced to open this one back up...as long as it stays civil. Thanks.
690165,BucktownAngler,2012-04-25 22:14:00,582," Good call, im curious to hear the outcome on this one"
690166,Grimace,2012-04-25 22:19:00,2020,Excellent.  As an OFAH member I am eager to see Mr Robinson's response.
690167,chessy,2012-04-25 22:20:00,610,thank you for opening it back up.. i am waiting for the reply
690176,jedimaster,2012-04-25 22:42:00,3472,I just got a similar letter saying I didn't return the tickets. I don't even recall getting any tickets. I also join OFAH for a club. There are some good things they do but this lottery thing is not one of them imo.
690568,BucktownAngler,2012-04-27 14:40:00,582,"boy, this post died quick  would love a response from the OFAH guy"
690573,Roy,2012-04-27 14:47:00,13728,It'll be back. There's no sense discussing this any further if we don't have and answer from OFAH but I'm certain that it's forthcoming.
