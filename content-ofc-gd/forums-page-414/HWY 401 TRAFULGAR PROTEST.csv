690683,BillM,2012-04-27 20:10:00,17367,"When's the protest start?  I just drove up from the big smoke, it was smooth sailing the entire way."
690686,Christopheraaron,2012-04-27 20:12:00,3525,"Now I'm worried, I'm going up at 6:30 AM tomorrow..."
690689,misfish,2012-04-27 20:16:00,29133,"They/news, on the radio have been reporting it the last three days,but it seems no one can say why. It,s at the truck inspection station. You didnt see aline up of trucks? Maybe I mis heard the hwy #. Maybe it,s the 401."
690690,TJQ,2012-04-27 20:18:00,7806,I would imagine the price of gas....
690691,misfish,2012-04-27 20:20:00,29133,"  Before Tybo corrects you Boss,it,s DESIEL."

690729,misfish,2012-04-27 22:38:00,29133,Thanks bdox.  Guess the price of lettuce is still safe.
690732,Billy Bob,2012-04-27 22:43:00,5865,"Oh OK, I thought it was about me driving in the center lane yesterday...."
690742,lickmyarmpit,2012-04-27 23:16:00,359,"They started there yesterday, supposedly they are getting fined regularly for being overloaded.  There was about fifty or sixty of them blocking the scales last night causing everybody to rubberneck."
690757,Christopheraaron,2012-04-27 23:57:00,3525,"Whoops, thought this thread said 400, I'm safe, for now."
690882,Carp,2012-04-28 14:15:00,1488,"Stuck in the backup the last 2 days. Not crazy about the traffic, but I understand their pains."
690888,tb4me,2012-04-28 14:45:00,3295,I wish they would protest the price of fuel..They are the guys n gals that could actually do somthing...If the trucks stop so does EVERYTHING..
690905,Fisherman,2012-04-28 16:24:00,7201," Well if they're that stoopid and can't figure out that overload=ticket, then maybe they should be pushing a wheelbarrow.  Oh right, wheelbarrows don't go 135km/h when overloaded."
690939,lew,2012-04-28 18:42:00,12766, It's stamped right on my wheelbarrow tire that I'm not allowed to go on the hiway with it. Takes me darned near forever to get any place having to run down the back roads to avoid the coppers
