690445,Fisherman,2012-04-26 23:59:00,7201,"Just a heads up for those that need another basic anchor, Navy style(not that the Air Force ever used anchors), 15lb for $17.99, and 28lb for $29.99 at your favourite PA store. Starts Tuesday."
690458,whiskywizard,2012-04-27 01:13:00,305,I guess I'm out of the loop... What is a PA store?
690459,Jer_H,2012-04-27 01:15:00,25,Princess auto
690460,skeeter,2012-04-27 01:16:00,1907,Princess Auto !!!  :thumbsup_anim:  :thumbsup_anim:  The man cave store.
690485,nofish4me,2012-04-27 03:12:00,404,  I've got stuff from PA that I'll give you to use for boat anchor.
690510,whiskywizard,2012-04-27 11:10:00,305,"Ahhh yes.  I never thought of Princess Auto.  I guess i havent started to connect them with fishing/marine because what Ive seen there so far was pretty low quality.  I suspect it will improve over time, just like their tools have."
690511,aplumma,2012-04-27 11:10:00,6896,So the air force does not use anchors but they are on sale in the auto parts store? I see said the blind man as he whipped out his hammer and saw....   Art
690512,Dave Bailey,2012-04-27 11:34:00,1641," Oh yeah? Dad flew these with the RAF Coastal Command, I'll ask him...  "
690943,soobnoob,2012-04-28 18:46:00,55,anybody know what weight is recommended for a 14 ft fishing boat?
690954,nofish4me,2012-04-28 19:41:00,404,"  Not sure, but I have a 350ci with a 4 barrel carb that would be, just perfect for you.  I'll PM address where you can pick it up."
690976,Fisherman,2012-04-28 21:25:00,7201," You should be okay with the 15 lb version.  Just remember to add about 3-4 feet of galvanized chain, then the rope. Otherwise, if you don't want to use the 350ci as above, you can alsways use the black version..a Merc."
691028,skeeter,2012-04-29 00:33:00,1907,"  Then that is your fault. If you read the store return policy, you wouldn't have a problem.  "" The Princess Auto Guarantee No sale is final until you're satisfied. We guarantee to make it right. We will repair, replace or refund any product to your satisfaction"". :thumbsup_anim:  Yes I have returned stuff with no questions asked, other then ""What is your phone number""."
691236,Dave Bailey,2012-04-29 20:48:00,1641," Just asked Dad, yep, the Short Sunderland had a regular old anchor up in the bow, near the nose gun turret.  But you're out of luck, he didn't manage to liberate any when he left."
691241,lew,2012-04-29 21:16:00,12766, I spose if they ever ran outta bullets they could have dropped the anchors on the subs
691255,Dave Bailey,2012-04-29 21:32:00,1641," ""Fritz, der Britishers iss gettink desparate!"""
691280,ecmilley,2012-04-29 23:07:00,2163,When I seen the title I thought F150's were on sale again
