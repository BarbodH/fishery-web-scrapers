Please check out the article about those changes before you head this way. I hope this information will save you some frustration.

691153,Grimace,2012-04-29 12:45:00,2020,Thanks for posting that article.  I have not fished the Detroit river in a few years.  It is a great place to fish.  I hope they lighten up a bit.  When I fish the Niagara River I always just go wherever I want to.  I know that on the New York State side it is law to always have your life jacket on when your boat is under power so I abide and always have my NYS licence on me.  This is making me think that I had better call someone and check to see if any laws have changed.  I haven't been in NYS waters in a few years but I always renew my NYS licence just in case the situation arises.
691163,Ralph Field,2012-04-29 13:14:00,1018,I think that boaters in the Niagara region have been dealing with these changes also. At least they seem to be applying the same set of rules on our boundary waters.
