691234,Big Cliff,2012-04-29 20:39:00,6899,"Wife decides that this weekend we have a ""FEW"" things to get done around here. Opening weekend is coming up and a good fishing buddy is planning to come up so I figure, ""work this weekend"" fish the next couple.  Well, the TV in the basement has to be moved up stairs to the living room, the TV in the living room has to be moved to the craft room, the TV in the craft room has to be moved to the basement. We had a water leak last year, need to do some fix ups. Need to get some stuff for the gardens.  Oh you think that is it? Wait, there is more; the cabnet in the basement has to be moved to the bedroom, the (whatever you call it) in the downstairs bathroom has to be moved to the upstairs laundry room. The TV in the craft room now has to be mounted on the wall, why? Well, it just makes sense! Then there are the holes in the wall that have to be filled, others that have to be drilled, and to top it all off, when I tried to put the new brackets on the TV in the craft room, wouldn't you know it, I cracked the screen! Now I need a new flat screen TV for Sue's craft room.  Now, I have just put in a 42.5 hour week at work, spent most of Saturday busting my ass to try to get things done around here. Spent most of today trying to get things done around here, ended up needing a new TV, and thinking who is smarter, the people that sit and collect wellfair or me?  No, it doesn't end there, there is more! Sue is taking care of the neighbours cat while they are away for a week. So, for the last three days she hasn't seen the cat but she can hear it crying. So today I go down to see if I can find the cat because Sue is worried. Dropped my $40.00 flashlight and watched it roll down the stairs and seperate as it bounced off the concrete at the bottom. Never did find the stupid cat and spent close to two hours searching. Flashlight is toast!  If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck at all!  Unless you can top this, I don't ever want to read another rant on this board!"

691237,mercman,2012-04-29 20:52:00,7054,"I smashed my thumb with the hammer on friday, putting up nails in the garden shed for new garden tools. Saturday it was throbbing so bad, i got out my dremel with a diamond bit on it. Someone told me to drill a hole  to let out the pressure.It worked, the blood spurt out, hit me in the eye, i dropped the dremel.It hit the maple kitchen table going 16000,did a pirouette in the wood and landed on the cushion floor where it carved a nice deisgn in it."
