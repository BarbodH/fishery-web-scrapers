Maybe it was the whole fly-in, fresh walleye, good company and cold beer but give this one a try  In a standard pot add 1 big table spoon of real butter. Dice 1/3 onion for each can of beans and simmer onions lightly in the butter. The key here is not to reduce the onion down but keep them slightly firm in texture Squeeze 1/4 lemon per can of beans onto the onions Add 1 tea spoon per can of your fav hot sauce (I add the Thai Sweet Chili sauce and triple it up to 3x) Add your beans and heat through   The guides called these BAD A** BEANS"
