691337,Bing,2012-04-30 02:18:00,33,Any ideas what the black flys and mosquitos will be like May 24 weekend? Heading to Restoule for five days
691340,kickingfrog,2012-04-30 02:42:00,8333,"Usually they are out but not at peak, really depends on the weather between now and then."
691341,TJQ,2012-04-30 02:57:00,7806,"Thats three weeks form now, I was just telling the wife, it will be interesting to see what the bugs do, its been a wierd spring."
691362,aplumma,2012-04-30 11:14:00,6896,I sure am glad I don't have to get a bug forecast before fishing down here. I would almost give up fishing I think....   Art
691366,bigbuck,2012-04-30 11:49:00,2449,"Wear proper clothing, cover all exposed skin with Muskol and you will be fine. The bugs will cruise around you but won't be biting. Its all about preparation folks."
691382,johnnyb,2012-04-30 13:26:00,3413,"The last three years, I've been in Temagami for May opener,  and they always seem to be just starting out, noticeable on the warmest days, but haven't been an issue.  However, when I get back to Muskoka at the end of each trip to drop off the boat, they seem to be in full swing and feeding heavily.  The bug spray will be very accessible when we go in this year...."
691384,BillM,2012-04-30 13:28:00,17367,I've been getting attacked in Coldwater for the past two weeks.   They will be out in full force by then!
691453,soobnoob,2012-04-30 16:27:00,55,who even knows anymore with the flux in temperatures so far this year... prepare for the worst n' hope for the best
691473,Rizzo,2012-04-30 17:34:00,4754,"oh ya, it will be ignorant. I have stopped making any May 24 plans that involve going north if my wife is involved. If its a boys week-end thing, put on the bug helmets and go for it! If the wimmin are coming and want to go for ""long romantic walks in the woods"" you are toast"
691547,4x4bassin,2012-04-30 19:33:00,1025," I couldn't agree more with this quote ! I can tell you that every May long weekend I go on a annual backwoods trip into central Ontario and the blackflies are bad but the mosquitos are non existent. This year is definitly different with the warm March and cool/cold and dry April . I was just up in the Loring area this past weekend and there wasn't a blackfly anywhere and in past years they were out buzzing around . It has been a cold , dry spring in that area ( trees haven't even budded out yet and lakes are low and cold ) so I think the bugs won't be as bad as in previous years but if it is warm and wet for the next couple weeks all bets are off and my theory will be wrong ! Here's hoping for a cool couple weeks"
691596,Christopheraaron,2012-04-30 20:35:00,3525,"Even if they are bad, fishing's worth it!"
691642,irishfield,2012-04-30 22:23:00,26272,  They always come out the Friday of the May 24... as they know that new blood is coming to the Provincal Park on opening day!!
691658,Joeytier,2012-04-30 22:40:00,3990,Giddy up!  I spent a day or two on Restoule last May long and you betcha there was blackflies
691660,fisherman7,2012-04-30 22:46:00,325,"I've been going to McQuaby Lake for May 24 for the last 20 years. Generally they are just coming out and are not too bad, but this is a wierd spring for sure!"
691681,cram,2012-04-30 23:34:00,1733,"Drier spring, so i bet there are fewer bugs."
