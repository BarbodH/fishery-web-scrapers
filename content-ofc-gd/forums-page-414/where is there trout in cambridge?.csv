I have tried many sections of the grand river and a few creeks people have mentioned to me but no luck. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated."

691177,Canuck2fan,2012-04-29 14:12:00,1444,My understanding is if you aren't fly fishing you aren't likely to ever get them in that area.... As for spots used to be just like any creek trout.  Anywhere there is a rock for them to sit behind as the current goes by you might find one. If there are over hanging branches that will almost certainly cause you to cast into them EVEN better. If you can find a spot where the temp of water drops a few degrees due to depth or shade would probably help too.
