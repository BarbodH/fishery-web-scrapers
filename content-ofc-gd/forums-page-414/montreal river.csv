Lots of different water and structure, decent numbers of walleye, pike and bass; but we didnâ€™t see much in size. It was good though because my son at the time was only something like 8 or 10 back then and he was catching fish. The part that impressed me about Marsh Bay itself was that even though there was quite a few cottages/homes along the shoreline; there were still a lot of wildlife mixed in. Beaver, muskrat and otter, were a common sight, which I thought was a good sign of a healthy waterway? Watch out for the deadheads some sections of the river are loaded with them, especially in the shallower areas and back bays.  Dan."
