612344,kickingfrog,2011-08-15 17:46:00,8333,I was watching a bit of the Bills preseason game on the weekend. Turns out timmies is the official bla bla bla to the Bills.  And they position themselves as a caf√© and bakery down there. Who knew?
612345,motion,2011-08-15 17:47:00,403,"Amazing isnt it. We have so many with in a few blocks of one another, we can walk from line-up to line-up. I wish I knew what they put in their darn coffee.............."

612358,Billy Bob,2011-08-15 18:05:00,5865," YEP, here if you get your coffee at one Timmy's and forget the creamer, you can just walk down to the next Timmy's but you will pass a Dunkin Donuts on the way....  At one time my community was noted for the most bars/taverns/gill mills per square mile....now it's coffee shops.."
