Now it looks like Ranger also has a pair of new boats for 2012.  The all-new Z520 and Z522 each get a higher front casting deck for better accuracy when pitching and flipping, which also results in more in-deck storage and rod locker storage as well. Further, the two new models will each get a recessed foot pedal in the front deck. Both new models take a 20-inch shaft outboard, and have all the standard Ranger Comanche features.  Ranger will offer a Touring Package on these two models that adds a keel protector, deluxe traveling boat cover, water line stripe, oxygenator, trailer parking brake and aluminum wheels from American Racing. The trailer parking brake, in particular, is a stellar feature.  I have no idea what they cost. They're Rangers. They won't be cheap.  Click here for pictures.    EDIT - fixed broken link"
