612094,Terry,2011-08-14 19:30:00,14456,"For Peanut Dipping Sauce: 1 small piece of lemon grass, chopped Freshly grated ginger-to taste 1 cup water ½ cup hoisin sauce 3 tablespoons smooth peanut butter 1½ tablespoons sugar  To make the peanut dipping sauce: In a small sauce pan, simmer lemon grass in the water for 5 minutes, strain out the lemongrass and add the remaining ingredients to the water. Whisk well and simmer an additional 5 minutes. If the sauce doesn't thicken, whisk for one minute over medium heat. Pour into individual serving cups and serve with spring rolls.
