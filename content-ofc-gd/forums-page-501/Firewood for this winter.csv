612775,crappieperchhunter,2011-08-17 00:28:00,2582,So I had a few trees taken down at the cottage. One was a nice birch that I'm cutting up to bring home and burn in my wood stove. I figure maybe 1/2 a bush cord total. I have always bought seasoned firewood and never used fresh wood I have cut myself.  My question is this. I just stacked the first bunch...smaller pieces/limb wood.... of it directly in my garage. It will be totally out of the weather. Will it be seasoned/dry enough for me to burn this winter or should I wait until next winter? And what about the body wood if I get it split and stored out of the weather?  Thx to all for any helpful info.

We,ll be cutting again in september and it will be outside stacked til next fall.  year/4 seasons, is the rule.Well the old rule anyways."

612808,vance,2011-08-17 01:32:00,719,According to the old timers and from what I have seen birch needs to be split or peeled as the bark seals in the water and causes it to rot in no time..  vance
612810,irishfield,2011-08-17 01:34:00,26272,Definitely.. Birch MUST be split or it will rot within it's own bark. Split it's good for years.. but should be left to air dry for at least 9 months.. a year being better
612868,barrystrs,2011-08-17 03:24:00,75,"I agree, birch needs to be split, even if it is not big.  It will dry much faster if it is piled single row in direct sunlight."
