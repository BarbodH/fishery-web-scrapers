611810,rufus,2011-08-13 12:06:00,267,"I started using a drop shot rig for walleye a few years ago and for one year it was almost all I used. Very simple and effective even when fish are just nibbling. It catches all sizes too - my fishing buddy caught a 28 inch walleye using the technique. Maybe something to add to your bag o' tricks if you are not already using it.   <center><iframe width=""560"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/nL70dURteHw"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>"
611813,Terry,2011-08-13 12:09:00,14456,drop shot rig is basically what I used as a kid but with livebait might be time to try it again..thanks for the tip
611847,Rod Caster,2011-08-13 14:23:00,5784,"I used this technique a few times last year and did pretty well... I sort of forgot about it this year, going back to more traditional methods. Thanks for the reminder! Next time I'm out, I'll try the d-shot again."
611894,ohhenrygsr,2011-08-13 18:47:00,947,LOL i love when he first dropped his rig in the water. I saw he had a bite before he did lol
611895,Roy,2011-08-13 19:12:00,13728,"Thanks for that, NWO. I don't for the life of me know when they started calling it ""dropshotting"". Up until my teens that's the only way I ever fished."
611979,gogu392,2011-08-14 02:10:00,142, Thank you for sharing.
611989,rufus,2011-08-14 02:51:00,267,"When I was a kid (Canadian) Pickerel Rigs were all the rage. When you think about it, they were basically a dropshot rig with two hooks. I have been reliving some old memories recently - using the Pickerel Rig with frozen minnows occasionally too. They still work  I was lurking at an American fishing forum a couple of years ago and they were discussing (laughing at) the Pickerel Rig because of the metal arms and red beads - they couldn't see how it could catch fish. That is what made me give it a try again!"
611994,mercman,2011-08-14 03:21:00,7054,"I used these rigs this year with much success for Jumbo Perch. I had forgotten all about them until i saw them again at CT and picked some up.They work amazingly well too Very interesting video, thanks for putting it up."
611999,Jds63,2011-08-14 03:53:00,1365,"very nice video , I like that technique as well, thanks"
612008,adolson,2011-08-14 04:56:00,783,"This is what did the last two trips to Mattagami Lake, got some walleye that way, yup. The people I was fishing with were not doing it this way, they put the sinker above the hook. We all caught fish. I didn't know it was called something specific or anything. But now I do."
612039,Rich,2011-08-14 13:06:00,3927,"Before bass fishermen stole the rig idea and labelled it ""drop shotting"" it was called a ""pickerel rig"".."
612049,bucktail,2011-08-14 15:19:00,1857,"All the time now, have a rig devoted to it. I get bit with plastics as good as i wou;ld with live bait but without the mess."
612343,Leecher,2011-08-15 17:40:00,7832,"I always have a pack of pickerel rig in my tackle box and use them in the boat when anchored.... I've caught bass, pike, cats, eyes etc... on it with live leeches.  It's especially good when fish are hugging bottom Thanks for sharing the video NWO! Leechman"
