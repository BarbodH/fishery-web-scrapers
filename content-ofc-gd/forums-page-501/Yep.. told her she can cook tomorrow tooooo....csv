612783,irishfield,2011-08-17 00:37:00,26272,"She also made a dipping sauce from balsamic, red wine, brown sugar and garlic to dip the filet in !"

612788,Joey,2011-08-17 00:46:00,9122,I must not have heard the phone ring for our invite for dinner   My Sunday supper looks not too bad too  
612792,spincast,2011-08-17 00:50:00,3279,very nice Joey - where'd you get the spit? I've been looking for one long enough for ours.
612797,Joey,2011-08-17 01:02:00,9122," Thanks, got it at Home Depot."
612807,Terry,2011-08-17 01:30:00,14456,I hear if you dip it in garlic butter it tastes like..  never mind I think that one has been done   looks good
612819,Roy,2011-08-17 01:56:00,13728,Kristal! Were you afraid the asparagus was gunna escape? Poor lil' things....
612821,irishfield,2011-08-17 02:00:00,26272,She hog tied them good Roy... no getting away for them little suckers!
612844,NAW,2011-08-17 02:32:00,4022,"That looks incredible.  Gunna try that, maybe this week."
612845,irishfield,2011-08-17 02:35:00,26272,"The ""fillets"" where just some cheap cuts of Sirloin grilling. 4 steaks... $10 total ! She wrapped them with bacon and lightly seasoned them.  Last week I bought 4 ""true"" steak cuts that cost me $50. They didn't hold a candle to tonights meal..."
612863,bigbuck,2011-08-17 03:17:00,2449,Don't go calling Sirloin 'cheap'!! It would make for a tastier steak than fillet since it has some more fat content. Just a bit of garlic salt and a touch of black pepper is all you need on a nice steak. Now you are making me hungry and it's bedtime!
612864,irishfield,2011-08-17 03:19:00,26272,AT $10 for 4 that size.. CHEAP ! LOL. I grew up in a butcher shop...
612879,Terry,2011-08-17 09:04:00,14456," why, didn't they want you in the house  "
612887,misfish,2011-08-17 10:19:00,29133, LMAO Good one Terry.
612903,Headhunter,2011-08-17 12:40:00,5703,"Uhmm... I don't see anywhere in this thread giving me my due, for introducing you to the wrapped aspargas!!!!!! I do believe I was the first to get you to eat the stuff... I guess my cheque is in the mail! Good lookin vitals there... next time put a cherry tomato or two on the tooth pics! HH"
612940,irishfield,2011-08-17 14:54:00,26272,LOL Joe... yah I have to give you credit as I wouldn't touch those green things with a ten foot pole my entire life until I was starving at the BOQ waiting for Terry to cook a meal ! LOL  Kristal picked the meal with no input from what we wanted... just a coincidence...  ..and Terry... it was pretty much one and the same. I was 4 when Dad bought our store and I played with my little wooden train set on the meat room floor or played in the walk in cooler. Not much has changed...now it's a beer fridge. lol
612945,Spiel,2011-08-17 15:09:00,9065,"  I was in the same boat Wayne until Joe cooked them up for a group of us at Bernie's. My mouth is watering just thinking about them.....  I'm hoping they'll be on the menu in September Joe....*hint, hint*  "
