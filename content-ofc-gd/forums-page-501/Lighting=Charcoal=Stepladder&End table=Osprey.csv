Strange, it was there two days before. A Lighting storm went through the area on Friday night, maybe ????  Sure enough upon checking it out , the nest was completey Obliterated A few charcoal sticks were visible around the Base of the Tower.         Then a Beautiful appearance from one  of the Soya Bean rows ....A Fledging        Apparently, the parents won't go to the ground to feed the chick.....And the chick won't get Airborne from the ground = Stepladder and an old end table.        Update to follow ....But things are not looking good for the chick and Mother to re-unite  Oh ya, the Bass  "
