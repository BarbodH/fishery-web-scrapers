612375,NAW,2011-08-15 18:55:00,4022,"I need some help.  I use a Symetre 1000FJ on my ice fishing and walleye rod.  After this ice fishing season, I started having issues with it.  The reel as started to tighten up.  It progressively gets worse until I take it apart, and clean it.  After that, it gets a little better, but it never feels like it used to.  So this time, I took it right apart.  Stripped it right down.  Now it's making a grinding noise.  I'm sure it's an assembly issue.  Has anyone else had their reel tighten up like that?  And if so, and tips on how to fix it once and for all."
612395,esoxansteel,2011-08-15 19:25:00,1307,"Yes I call it the shimano bump, and I had then do it from the saharas up to the stellas, on the higher end reels noy sure about the symetres there is a red gasket on the bottom of the rotor head that can get out of shape causing the reel to stiffen, also the bump im refering to is a dead spot when the slowly reeling in as in draggin a tube, or fishin a walleye jig slowly, once the side plate is removed and the main gear is moved a couple of teeth it will work for a bit and do the same, its a shame that so many parts are made offshore, the tolorences are just not there, but dont worry as a previous thread mentioned shimano will only stock parts for a 5 year period, that way it forces you to by more of that junk, or get smart and look elsewhere, if shimanos pro-staff had to you their equipment for over a year, like most of us, they to would realize what junk they have to say nice things about"

612415,Gregoire,2011-08-15 20:15:00,1397," Wow...that is one of the most intelligent posts I have read in a while. You make a really good point. We complain about buying cheap products, but not about the price. It is possible to buy reels that are made in north america, they are just more expensive, so most of us don't want to spend more. Same with rods. The manufacturers are just giving us what we are asking for, a lower cost item. I think the blame here should go to the consumer, because we want the impossible. Low cost products that are made of high quality materials. Also people say that things were built better back in the day, but they also cost a lot more, people just had a lot less stuff so they could afford to spend more. I, like a lot of other people fall for the more is better lifestyle. Heck, I own two finesse fishing rods, and I will probably only use them 5 times a year. There is a price to pay. As a society we want to own more things. In order to afford them they are made cheaper...sorry for the rant."
612436,jedimaster,2011-08-15 21:13:00,3472,"I doubt many reels are designed and tested for cold weather like we see in canadian ice fishing. Expansion, freezing etc... all plays havoc on metal and plastic pieces. Thats why I only take my junk reels ice fishing. Its probably a gear, or washer."
612526,Dabluz,2011-08-16 02:37:00,701,"I have a Shimano Symetre 2000 that I bought over 10 years ago.  It's still as smooth as ever.  If I turn off the anti-reverse, the reel turns until the handle is in the down position.  I use this reel for everything from small brook trout, smelt, walleye, pike and landlocked salmon."
612564,NAW,2011-08-16 12:34:00,4022,"When I first bought the reel, I noticed a very very slight noise when I reeled it fast.  I should have returned it then.  I tinkered with the gears a little more, and got it back together.  Not quite as smooth as when it was new..  But good enough for now.  Thanks for replies guys!"
612591,bigbuck,2011-08-16 14:13:00,2449,Send it in to Shimano to get reworked.
612594,NAW,2011-08-16 14:20:00,4022, What would they charge for something like that?
612598,bigbuck,2011-08-16 14:26:00,2449,Probably no more than 20-40 bucks.
612607,Gregoire,2011-08-16 14:56:00,1397,You want might want to phone in or send an e-mail to make sure that they have the parts for the reel to be serviced. There was a post on here not too long ago about shimano changing their service policies.
