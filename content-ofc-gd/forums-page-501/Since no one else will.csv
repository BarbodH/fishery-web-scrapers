IMO he was the best rock and roll artist,gospel artist.If he were alive today,there would be no one that could touch him as far as ticket sales go.You would never see him at Rama til he was maybe 90.LOL  Heres what  that I like the best.

612744,mercman,2011-08-16 23:26:00,7054,"Hail to the King of Rock and Roll. I can remember exactly where i was and what i was doing the day he died.People were weeping openly all around me, it was a sad day indeed."
612745,crappieperchhunter,2011-08-16 23:28:00,2582,"Slightly before my time...but alot of his stuff is timeless. I think ""In the Ghetto"" is one of my FAV's of his too.  I think your mistaken about the death thing though Brian. He was 2 behind me in line at No Frills today"

612757,irishfield,2011-08-17 00:00:00,26272,I was fifteen and can tell you exactly whom I was chasing... but Elvis... not a clue (at the time anyhow).
612764,misfish,2011-08-17 00:11:00,29133,"  I was 13 then. Back then, live performaces were the norm on TV by the top performers, not like today, where ya got to pay big ticket prices to see them at a show and not on TV.  I was out playing with a some friends and came home to find my mom crying. Asked her why? When she told me,I couldnt believe it. 13 going on 18."
612768,lookinforwalleye,2011-08-17 00:19:00,4399,"I was 20 at the time and was a big Elvis fan both movies and music, had just got home from work and heard.  It was a shock!  Viva Las Vegas forever!!!   13 back then Brian your just a young whipper snapper!!!"
612772,misfish,2011-08-17 00:24:00,29133," Back then ,it was Donny or Elvis."
612780,bucktail,2011-08-17 00:35:00,1857,Come on everyone knows he lives in Tweed and pumps gas for a living!
612787,mercman,2011-08-17 00:45:00,7054, You were only 15  Cripes.....where can i find some old coots i can relate to in here  I bet you dont even know who Phylis Diller is  Young bucks.....sheesh
612790,misfish,2011-08-17 00:47:00,29133," HA HA HA HA ,Oh I DO.    DARYLYN."
612806,mercman,2011-08-17 01:29:00,7054,  You're an old soul Brian.
612811,Terry,2011-08-17 01:34:00,14456, yeah I am telling you she took vitamin A vitamin B vitamin C vitamin D vitamin E ..but she still looked like H  what was her husband..fang or something like that
612816,bigugli,2011-08-17 01:56:00,6138,"I think I dated her younger sister  Elvis didn't have too many fans around my neighbourhood, but we loved teasing the ladies who drooled over the ""Pelvis"". Often at risk of severe pain."
612817,mercman,2011-08-17 01:56:00,7054," And, she's still alive   My mother-in-law had a pain beneath her left breast. Turned out to be a trick knee.  The reason women don't play football is because 11 of them would never wear the same outfit in public.  We spend the first twelve months of our children's lives teaching them to walk and talk and the next twelve telling them to sit down and shut up.  You know you're old if your walker has an airbag"
612837,Rattletrap2,2011-08-17 02:25:00,1652,"Hate to break it to ya Mr. B, but I was in Vegas last week and saw him wandering the streets several times!"
612913,Beans,2011-08-17 13:25:00,3339, I think Elvis and a bunch of his offspring were up in Collingwood for a family reunion earlier this year...   
612918,Beans,2011-08-17 13:54:00,3339, I was 41 and had been under the tutelage of Smith and Wilson for 5 years the day Elvis died...  Big Cliff and Lew were about 31 years old then...is that older and cootier enough for you ?  Dunno how old Roy might have been then...when he was born...Yonge Street was still a forest and Christ was just a yearling...
612921,blaque,2011-08-17 14:01:00,2419,"I was 6 when he died......but i remember my dad listening to elvis non stop in the car when we drove down to Disney World,... Bout 28 hours of Elvis lol. Wasnt exactly what i wanted to hear, but listening to it now brings me back to those road trips to Florida. Fond memories for sure.  I went to high school with a guy that has been a full time Elvis impersonator since he graduated high school. Pretty famous here in western new york actually."
612922,Gregoire,2011-08-17 14:03:00,1397,I thought this post would be about releasing a big salmon. I'm slightly disappointed. By the way I was in my mom's womb.
612927,Roy,2011-08-17 14:29:00,13728," Yeah, our history books had but two or three paragraphs. The average life span was only 41 back then so I guess we've both dodged the bullet pretty well eh Norm? Of course I never reached the average height so we're even."
612952,motion,2011-08-17 15:20:00,403,"Hey Brian, I think you should change the topic heading to ""How old are you""  Ya, I remember that tragic event 34 years ago. Seems like just yesterday though."
612958,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-17 15:44:00,2690,"I was 12, never a big Elvis fan, but the dude sure could sing!  My fave is probably Suspicious Minds."
