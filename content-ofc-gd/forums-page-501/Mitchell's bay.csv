I can see that the water has continued to be a bit muddy this year, and was wondering if that is affecting things.  Thanks in advance."

612519,Djeep,2011-08-16 02:17:00,199,"The water is dirtier than usual, however, if you get out a couple miles (~3 miles) in some deeper water it clears right up. I've had good success on lsc lately in around 10 fow with weeds up to 5 fow or so on crankbaits and spinnerbaits. Fish are scattered on this pattern but average size of both smallies and largies has been good. Here's a 20"" smallie I picked up this past saturday. I've been consistently getting a fish or two like this most trips this season out of the bay covering water - power fishing, with plenty of other good fish. Get out there and good luck! Look for the 'ol red lund.  "
