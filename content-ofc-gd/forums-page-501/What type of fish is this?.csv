This weekend they have started catching these fish out of the blue. Never caught them before, never seen them in the lake before....  They figure it is a creek chub or a common dace....basically some variety of minnow. Does anyone on here know for sure? Also would this be a species that occurs naturally in that area or would this have been dumped overboard by an uneducated esox angler? Odd that they have NEVER caught them before and now they have caught multiple in the past week. Thanks in advance for any insight you can offer. Bosh"

612907,Roy,2011-08-17 12:52:00,13728,Looks like a fall fish from here.
612908,Roy,2011-08-17 12:54:00,13728,"Looks like we're on the same schedule, Bucktail. Are you on your 4th coffee as well?"
612910,bucktail,2011-08-17 12:58:00,1857,Nope just finished first but I am going to need 4 this morning to get my brain in gear!!  
612911,bdox,2011-08-17 13:01:00,329,Pretty sure that's a cisco
612912,Spiel,2011-08-17 13:16:00,9065,Looks like a Fallfish to me.
612934,mbosh1980,2011-08-17 14:37:00,349,Thanks guys
612949,hammercarp,2011-08-17 15:15:00,964,My guess is fallfish. I have caught them from shore on a worm under a float and even on small spinners.
