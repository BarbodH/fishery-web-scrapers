612361,newb09,2011-08-15 18:13:00,49,Can we fish just up from the maid of the mist?  Thanks
612538,newb09,2011-08-16 04:21:00,49,I appreciate the overwhelming responses. For those who would like to know I found out it is illegal to be there.
612541,markiemark70,2011-08-16 04:41:00,158,Thanks for the info. It's too bad no one made the effort to let you in on an unwritten rule around here: make you first post an introduction rather than a request and you will be welcomed.  Thanks for the info re the Niagara river. Now how about you tell us what you are fishing for and maybe show us a pic or two. We like fish porn.  Welcome.

612693,newb09,2011-08-16 20:31:00,49, thanks for letting me know. I will post a brief introduction of myself 
612694,newb09,2011-08-16 20:34:00,49," Actually to do a fishing show there, they need a special permit to get there.  here is an old discussion about the same topic  http://www.niagarafishing.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=17455   "

Sometimes I'd bike afterschool, sometimes we'd drive with friends or my parents would drop me off. Never asked for access and never were told to leave.  Always felt like i was in the wrong place but a couple fish would take care of that. Had a barrel go over one day.  Access may have changed since 911.  Aside from steelies and salmon there are big smallies down there.  Good luck and watch your step."
