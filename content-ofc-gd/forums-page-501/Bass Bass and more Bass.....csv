612815,limeyangler,2011-08-17 01:52:00,5204,Thats insane Cliff!!!   Those bass are freeks!
612173,ccmtcanada,2011-08-15 00:40:00,7971,"Well, after getting home from Alberta on Thursday night, I headed to my cousin's cottage again for Friday evening.  He was late getting there, so I made myself at home on the back deck overlooking the bay the cottage is on.  I walked down to the dock and I saw a HUGE bass staring back at me!  I ran to the car to get my fishing rod and started throwing all I had at that fish...but it wasn't interested enough to bite.  It came out a few times...then slowly backed up.  The sun was going down, so I just made a few casts from the dock and caught 3 from there.    One from the dock...   The next morning we were up and on the water by 820ish.  They were calling for rain on and off all day, but there was none to be seen.  Historically I have sucked at bass fishing, but recently I have been working on fishing weightless and paying close attention to my line as my bait slowly drops.  It's paid off, as I seem to be catching them now!   My cousin with a great 5.2 pounder!   Another one from the first day....   After having a great rib dinner and watching fishing shows and movies I headed to bed...completely exhausted.  We were up around 730ish Sunday morning...and as I enjoyed my coffee, the fog was clearing nicely....   We were only out a few hours...it was pretty windy and a tough fish, but we managed to pull some nice ones from the weedbeds.   "
612174,Nipfisher,2011-08-15 00:42:00,2449,Well done. Looks like a nice place.
612176,Rizzo,2011-08-15 00:44:00,4754,great report. I started weightless fishing about 20 years ago and have never gone back. You're right about watching the line! I'm often setting hooks before even feeling anything. A few days ago I posted my cottage for rent in the classifieds section and the bass shown in that thread were also all caught with some kind of weightless presentation. These are some real beauties you got into! Congrats

612179,Grimace,2011-08-15 00:49:00,2020,Two thumbs up!!
612187,spinnerbaitking,2011-08-15 01:06:00,1622,"Wow I really need to get out of here, you sure did figure out how to catch them  SBK"
612196,Rod Caster,2011-08-15 01:44:00,5784,You got the bass-monkey off your back. I'd say your doing very well now! Great report.

612203,young_one,2011-08-15 02:32:00,620,pink mixed worm with elastic bands? Nice report! I definitely need to fish slower at times.
612213,fishnsled,2011-08-15 03:07:00,3520,When are you starting the tournament trail Cliff?? Some really nice fish there!!
612227,Terry,2011-08-15 09:36:00,14456,real nice fish
612233,fishindevil,2011-08-15 10:43:00,6254,"awesome cliff !!! some very nice bass for sure,it looks like a great place too ...cheers"
612267,Harrison,2011-08-15 14:06:00,2202,Really Nice fish Cliff.  I love that lake.
612270,ccmtcanada,2011-08-15 14:12:00,7971, Rizzo...seeing your line suddenly speed up or change directions is pretty cool to see!  On calm days it's much easier...will have to look into high visibility line for those choppy days on the water.  Your cottage looks great btw!    You are too funny merc!    Those pink/brown ones and just straight black worked well!  Tournaments?? LOL.
612273,johnnyb,2011-08-15 14:17:00,3413,"Great stuff Cliff...you seem to be getting out a lot lately...or posting more...very happy for you  It's so awesome going on line movement alone when you set the hook, and come up against a solid fish....good job on switching up and learning the tactic"
612285,Headhunter,2011-08-15 15:04:00,5703,Nice Cliff! Great to see you getting out more... HH
612321,eman,2011-08-15 16:40:00,101,"Those are some beauty Bass, nice job!  Speaking of weightless baits......I suck with them. I have mainly tried senkos (weightless or w/ small weighted hook) and can't get a fish to bite. I think I'm missing alot of fish on the fall.  I have no confidence in them, and usually switch back to 7"" berky power worm texas rigged (1/4 oz of bigger) depending on weeds & depth. I see tons of people using them and having success. I must be doing something wrong or have bricks for arms.  I like the high vis line idea.  Any tips would be apprciated. thanks"
612347,Leecher,2011-08-15 17:50:00,7832,Some nice bass Cliff That 5.2Lb'er is a beauty!!! Congrats to your cousin Thanks for sharing Leechman

612357,GBW,2011-08-15 18:01:00,8460,"so you figured out the trick did you?  you know, the one where you say ""this spot isn't know for ____"" and you get the big ones..."
612512,WeedLine,2011-08-16 01:58:00,322,Great looking fish. Those are some big bass
612677,nexstar,2011-08-16 19:52:00,63,I love weightless presentation too. it caught me the most fish. 5' senko on a 4/0 hook texas rigged and bass can't resist.  good report
612758,spincast,2011-08-17 00:00:00,3279,nice fish - and beauty lake. Congrats
