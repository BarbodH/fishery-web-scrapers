612609,mike rousseau,2011-08-16 15:10:00,4661,Hey  I'm looking to stock up on big live bait for fall musky...  I'm looking for pretty much any minnow 8-12 inches... preferably creek chubs or suckers...  I live between Montreal and Ottawa...  And I'm looking for a store that can get me at least... 36 minnows... I would take more if they can get it...
612625,cram,2011-08-16 15:48:00,1733," Can't help you on where to buy, but curious -- how do you keep them from swallowing the bait?  I use big minnows for pike fishing in the spring and as hard as we try still have mortality.  Difference is we can eat the pike."
612627,mercman,2011-08-16 15:55:00,7054,"Mike, i just spoke with Lauzon's, the owner, and he can get them for you on order. He has contacts and suppliers that can get them that size. give him a call.514-453-5018  "
612637,The Urban Fisherman,2011-08-16 16:22:00,2050," Man when I lived in Sudbury, where I grew up I could get those in a night or two in my minnow traps for free! I have to think that you could do the same in your area?  Trapping minnows was a great bonding experience for me and my Dad - something I really should do with my own kids.  Cheers - and good luck finding your bait!  Ryan"
612638,mike rousseau,2011-08-16 16:32:00,4661,It's hard to trap minnows 9-12 inches... Lots of by-catches... I'd rather buy them...
612639,mike rousseau,2011-08-16 16:34:00,4661, I've never gut hooked a musky... Never... I use a large single big gun catfish hook... You do miss enough fish but they will hit several times before getting spooked...
612664,Jigs,2011-08-16 19:08:00,136,I know this guy used to have them in the fall. (Fran-Val in St-Zotique) This was a couple years ago though. It's a bit closer than Dorion for you also. I'd give him a ring first to make sure.   http://www.canpages....l#mapdirections   Also this guy in Cornwall always has minnows year round. Not sure about anything that big though.  http://www.yellowperchcompany.com/
612676,Musky or Specks,2011-08-16 19:51:00,2710,Why not just go angle them. Little bit of cheese on a hook in the creeks right in town here get us plenty for the fall. Keep them in an aerated bucket. Go catch them mid september.
612771,ChrisK,2011-08-17 00:21:00,2772,Agreed..This is a great way to catch big chub in a hurry and its quite fun to be honest. We used to go down to the crick in one of the deeper runs and catch up a doz in no time with a small hook and piece of worm...
612795,mike rousseau,2011-08-17 00:52:00,4661,If I knew where they were I would catch them... But I don't... So I'm looking for a place to buy them...
