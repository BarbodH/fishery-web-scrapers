We had got as far as the end of the pier after a few miles and turned around due to the waves. No problem as I told my girls, we will go fishing for another big boy called the toothy critter We tried very hard indeed and decided to call it quits in the mid am due to the storm that may aproach us All I told them was maybe next time we can try again, they were happy as glee Anyhow, I was here on OFC at mid day and received a pm from an invite I proposed a while back. So off I went to meet up with live2fish85 after lunch and hit lady O again. This time it was east bound, and still chancing the weather. Off we went to my stomping grounds. After setting all the lines up, within 20 minutes, at the corner of my eye I saw a twitch on the rigger rod. Well as he was my guest I told him to grab it. Sure enough a bow was landed and returned safely to its elders After that we went on to troll for the mamas and papas.  Sure enough I decided to turn on the vhf and guess what, time to pull the lines in head full tilt for shore. A major storm was aproaching. We made it back safe and sound thank god.  We did not get skunked and it wasnt anything to write home about. But I had a great day a fishing with a great gent, thats all that counts  Heres the monster of the day "

612547,ccmtcanada,2011-08-16 11:01:00,7971,That fish is a lot bigger than you think...no arm extension!!  The great thing about fishing with friends is its not always about the catching.  Good on you for getting out and heeding the weather!  You worked hard for that fish!
