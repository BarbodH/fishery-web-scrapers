612520,Pikeslayer,2011-08-16 02:18:00,1443,  Yep. Totally nice! Thx guys.  Nice to have the fishery in our back yard. BC's still on my bucket list though.
612524,Pikeslayer,2011-08-16 02:28:00,1443,Hope you get one Adam. I didn't bother withe derby ticket this year. Lots of guests and a few charity outings pretty much disqualifies any fish on my boat. Ggod luck to you It was pretty bouncy out there on Sunday. Pretty sure that put some added stress on the lines. Lesson learned though. Check cable more often.  Thx Wayne. Sure was a confidence builder/payback after a couple of clusters on Saturday.
612528,Joeytier,2011-08-16 02:45:00,3990,"Lost probes always suck, but that's a hell of a fish.  Only one tyee for myself as well.  Good to see ya supporting Tightline.  used to work there myself not long ago."
612557,corvette1,2011-08-16 12:02:00,1765,awesome king
612570,Harrison,2011-08-16 12:57:00,2202,Great report
612593,I'mHooked,2011-08-16 14:14:00,525,"Well, with what I recall of your reaction to the 13+lb PB 'bow a few weeks ago, I can only imagine the colourful language on this haul!  See...you posting video is like me posting pictures!  Looks like was an awesome outing. Any bananas on the boat? Maybe that's why the cable broke?"
612597,Pikeslayer,2011-08-16 14:23:00,1443, Hmmm Craig. One would require proof (such as a photo) that there were actually bananas on the boat. Maybe your son could help you figure out photobucket
612605,I'mHooked,2011-08-16 14:55:00,525," Ok, ok, well it's not photobucket, but I have managed at least these:  Good looking crew!   Yes, those are bananas that almost blend in with the banana coloured shirt.   The intense ""please don't let this one break off"" determination with this guy was increadible! (Good thing you had a capable net attendent  ) "
612383,Pikeslayer,2011-08-15 19:07:00,1443,"Took out my son-in-law and the outlaws (his parents) on LO yesterday. After a not great day prior (due to motor/equip malfunctions), I was looking for redemption. Based on the recent previous outings, I had a program and was determined to stick with it. We got a late start as the outlaws were a little late rising. Anyways, on the water @ 7:30, waypoints @ 8:00 and all six lines in by 8:15. We stayed clear of the packs and shared our 'zone' with maybe 3-4 other boats. We were marking huge (I mean really huge bait balls) every 10/15 minutes. I marked each with a wp and had a new route programmed into the Lowrance. We had a few shakers (released) in the first 30 minutes. First good fish came at approx 9:00. Here's a short clip (camera battery was low  and wanted to preserve power for something significant ).  <iframe width=""425"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/UXBTXgR6nIY"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  It was a solid 10 minute fight and weighed in @ 16.9 lbs. A quick torpedo back in the water, no upgrade = no picture.  Next 60 minutes was more shakers and a few knock offs & a nice 6 lb bow, but we stuck to the program. 10:15 we got a monster hit of the port wire line, but it broke off. At the same time, we were changing spoons on the riggers and lost the Moor Sub Troll probe & topedo weight due to a kink in the line??? I took it in stride, but now we were fishing blind and the winds had turned and came from the east. We stuck with the known depths, maintained our route and carried on (with 2 less lines in the water). 10:30 am port side wire fires again, outlaw Steve is up. The dipsey was set 150' back. When the fish stopped peeling wire, there was 390' feet of wire between Steve and a big fish. Here's a short clip (batteries  ) just about the time the wire stopped singing;  <iframe width=""425"" height=""349"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/b_eZ0V2Udtg"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>  So 20 minutes later, not withstanding some tense drama and a challenging net job off the stern, the King came to Daddy. Here's Steve's ""4 lbs maybe 5""    A little assistance was required to torpedo the fish back in the water.    32.4 lbs on a rapala electronic hand scale. The first tyee ever for our 'crew'.  It's 11:00 am after the adventure is over. Waves and winds had picked up substantially and it was time to head back to port. It was a relatively short day on the water but certainly one of the most memorable ever.  As mentioned, this was a 'pricey' fish; Lost torpedo weight..............$35.00 Lost probe unit.....................$190.00 Fish of a lifetime.........................................  NEXT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Slayer  ps. How the heck can I get the actual youtube video on the post????????????????"

612491,spincast,2011-08-16 00:50:00,3279,"Very Nice -. Congrats. There must have been a fish in the lake with wire cutters on Sunday - cause I lost a ball too?! Wire looked fine when it went down, and was cut clean as whistle when it came up. No fraying, just sliced - but waited until I hit the retrive to part company ."
612497,irishfield,2011-08-16 00:57:00,26272,At the price of Lead these days there maybe a scuba diver out there collecting them!  Nice to top the 30 lb mark Simon !
