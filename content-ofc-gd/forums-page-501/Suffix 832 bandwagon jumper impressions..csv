601520,BillM,2011-07-11 15:56:00,17367, Perhaps myself and Terry and the rest of the guys who've had problems can get a few tips from you pros...
601531,umKthxbye,2011-07-11 16:24:00,247,Maybe one day I can take you under my wing young patawan. Lol.  I just meant that new line requires adjustments. PP is stiffer te the 832 so by adjusting your technique you can avoid the problems.
601534,bdox,2011-07-11 16:30:00,329,"I tossed cranks for a couple hours last night on 20lb 832. Not a single issue. The line is very supple and casts great. I didn't have any wrapping problems, although I wasn't fishing contact baits, and I'm assuming that's where people are experiencing problems.  One thing people aren't getting though, is that wrapping is a trade-off of a supple line. You WILL experience tip-wrap. Wind will make it even worse.  I will stick to PowerPro for my bottom/contact presentations, and keep 832 for my reaction/moving baits, due to the casting efficiency."
601555,BillM,2011-07-11 16:57:00,17367," Not a line you wanna be tossing topwaters with (especially walk the dog types)..  Like I mentioned before, switched back to PP, problems are gone.  We'll see how long it stays on my spinning setups"
601786,peter23,2011-07-11 23:26:00,95,havent had much wrapping around the tip but my line broke randomlly a couple times and no other braid has done this except for the suffix.
601818,solopaddler,2011-07-12 00:35:00,8605,I've been using 10lb on my spinning reels and 40 and 50lb on my casting reels this year.  Other than color fading it's performed great.
601950,fish_fishburn,2011-07-12 11:35:00,1311,"All these problems seem really strange to me.  I have been using this line on a baitcaster and a spinning reel and haven't encountered any of these problems. I have used it for about a month now and it still looks the same as the day I put it on, even the colour is the same, no bleeding. Try letting all your line out behind the boat for ten minutes or so with nothing tied to it as your trolling, it sucks for bites but when you reel it in and give it a go all your misfortunes will probably be gone. I love this line and will be buying more. The line I am currently using is 20lb. As for PP I have only used it once about 5 yrs ago in a bass tourney. Broke off 50lb test slaying largies about three times that day and that was the end of my experiment with that stuff."
602073,BillM,2011-07-12 20:50:00,17367," You haven't had any bleeding issues?  My once green line is now a nice tinge of yellow, lol."
602076,mercman,2011-07-12 21:01:00,7054,"Every braid i have ever used has bled and changed colors, except spiderwire white Doesnt matter what make or color other than white, it bled out quickly.   "
602077,BillM,2011-07-12 21:08:00,17367,Maybe we weren't blessed with magic line like it seems some people were.  To bad!  lol
602079,danbouck,2011-07-12 21:19:00,4380,"My magic line has performed great, no complaints."
602084,BillM,2011-07-12 21:38:00,17367," Dan, you kiss pike, someone is shining down on you  :)"
612329,johnnyb,2011-08-15 17:00:00,3413,"Had to drag this thread up because I had a shocking revelation on the weekend.  My powerpro destroys suffix for casting distance and smoothness on the SPINNING reel. I've been using 2 baitcast and 2 spinning combos all summer, with one of each combo having pp and one having suffix.  Suffix is 30#test, I believe pp is the same...or whatever's closest.  Both new spools of line. I really can't tell any difference with the baitcaster....and with the spinning combos, I haven't done much casting with the pp combo.  MOstly been dropshotting with it, and tossing worms with the suffix-spool. So......I switched spinning reels, and used the reel with pp to start tossing worms....and WOW what a difference!  There's just no resistance as it comes off the spool, while the Suffix seems to be tightly wound, and really cuts down on distance. I grabbed the suffix combo and tied on an x-rap....fairly disappointing casting distance, I gotta say. I would consider chalking this up to a difference in the reels themselves....but the suffix is much noisier as it comes off the spool, and I can feel the lure's momentum being compromised.  The powerpro practically falls off the reel, and now I have an insane worm combo Perhaps suffix is good for people having issue with extra loops and tangles.....but I usually pay close enough attention that this is not a problem for me.  I really thought the lines were comparable in every other regard so far....but this pretty much seals the deal for me.....suffix is allowed on baitcasters....but not much point in buying it over powerpro unless it's on sale."
612330,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-08-15 17:07:00,1107,  I haven't had hardly any fading on mine it's a bit lighter green but not much
612359,bucktail,2011-08-15 18:10:00,1857,Half of my rods with this on have had little fading while a couple of others have had extreme fading ( so bad that I had green hands at the end of the day). Strange!!
600674,Spiel,2011-07-08 17:50:00,9065,Haven't yet tried it Bill but given your report (and knowledge) I'm not likely too.
600675,johnnyb,2011-07-08 17:51:00,3413,"I've been running 30lb on an MH baitcaster and a M spinning outfit....same spool of suffix on both.  Not a ton of bleeding....zero breaks....and I have to say...I no tip-wrapping issues to speak of.  Having been a long time PP user...I don't see many significant advantages in this stuff....but perhaps it floats a bit better, which I love when fishing the wacky worm."
600682,Old Man,2011-07-08 18:02:00,822,"  I agree 100%. Bad enough on a calm day, add a bit of wind and it will drive you crazy. I've used it on a spinning outfit and had problems as well."
600683,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-07-08 18:06:00,0,I also use the 30 lb 832.  i've been using it this year fishing the river for 'eyes.  excellent sensitivity as i tick the rocks even in the heavy current areas and i've yet to lose a lure other than jigs.  I found PP tough to fish with for reasons similar to your complaints so perhaps variations in guide choice and gear ratios affects these lines differently.  If you don't mind trying the 30lb it might help your situation but if you prefer the lower diameter of the PP then why fix what isn't broken?
600692,Harrison,2011-07-08 18:21:00,2202," Gordie, see those two lures.  The green and black one.  Take the black one and put it in a package that says ""Cloudy"".  Take the green one and put it in the ""Sunny"" package.  Now take that top water lure and put in the ""dawn & dusk"" package.....  Wait a sec, that may actually sell... above is trademarked, copyright of plentyofphil.com"
600703,bdox,2011-07-08 18:42:00,329,"Well, if you don't like the 832 there is going to be a new entry from Shimano/Powerpro coming out before the end of the summer.  This is the 2012 Stradic FJ spooled with ""PowerPro Super 8 Slick""  "
600713,umKthxbye,2011-07-08 20:01:00,247,I've never had issue with mine. I use the 50lb neon lime. I've been using it since March I think and the color is still yellow but has faded from the neon lime. No bleeding when I used it fresh out of the spool. No random line breaks at all. I've had some good snags and manage to catch a few trees. I've also found that it doesn't fray like the other braids I've used. I've got nothing negative about this line other then I want to see the neon lime come to Canada ASAP.  I fish Lake O from shore and take lots of wind every time I go out and haven't had any issues. Anytime it wraps around my first guide its cuz I did something to make that happen during the cast. But a quick flick of the rod takes it out.
600714,msp,2011-07-08 20:03:00,1336,I will switch back to P.P as well. If it aint broke dont fix it.
600732,GBW,2011-07-08 21:05:00,8460,interesting read now that a lot of you have had a decent amount of time to test it out.  for now I'll sitck to my spiderwire in the green moss for braid.
600737,fisherboy,2011-07-08 21:21:00,48,"I actually had a lot of problems with PP 8lb wrapping around the guides, when I jig (sometimes over-zealously) with my spinning rod... Never tried the Suffix though but I likely won't after reading this post."
600743,blarg,2011-07-08 21:52:00,289,"I have been using 10lb mostly fishing jigs for bass, it seems fine, i don't think it's much different than the pp, it might cast a little better."
600772,RickOnt,2011-07-08 23:40:00,669,"Now That's ""FUNNY"""
600801,Moosebunk,2011-07-09 00:39:00,3970,"Hadn't tried it Bill.  Problem with experimenting so far, it's failed.  PP is still best on for me.  Thanks for the review."
600877,Cudz,2011-07-09 04:28:00,2652,I once used 15 pound pp on a Baicaster and had all the same problems you are experiencing.  Have never put anything less than 30 pound on baitcasters since and never the issues.  I don't like to go less than 15 pound test on spinning setups either.  Try 30 pound and I bet your issues of breaking and looping around eyes is gone.
600890,dhickey,2011-07-09 07:11:00,1038,Sufix is going in the fire pit. Waist of money.. Power pro is no better... I will gladly replace my spools with 8 pound mono!! Half the cost better results. Last long wknd I put down my crucial with sufix (to many problems over last 6 outings). picked up the comprey with 6 pound mono never lost a fish(4-5lbs bass and 4 pike 3- 8 lbs).. Going to try the flouro but dont have high expectations.  Wouldnt even put the suckixxxx on my icefishing pertch gear..
600907,archie_james_c,2011-07-09 11:37:00,618,Yup the stuff is sub par IMO. I'll stick to 8lb PP on my spinning rods
600926,Live2fish85,2011-07-09 13:31:00,1633,I had similar problems with the Suffix 832. I also found that the gore in the line was to be a pain allowing the ling the braid to slide up the gore and wrinkle when it snapped. I won't be using it again thats forsure.
600939,GBW,2011-07-09 14:19:00,8460,"Chris, are you saying that the gore fiber stayed straight while the braid moved around it thus causing break off spots?  just asking as that's how I read your reply.  thanks."
601176,BillM,2011-07-10 17:48:00,17367,"Put 20lb PPro back on the Calais yesterday, problems are gone.  I did notice the 832 liked to fray a lot as well.  Live and learn I guess.  I've still got some on a few of my spinning setups, but will probably be going back to 6lb Fireline Crystal on them to."
601308,umKthxbye,2011-07-11 01:22:00,247,"Weird, I found it to fray allot less."
601309,BillM,2011-07-11 01:24:00,17367,  I had frays all up and down the first 6ft of line after half a day of fishing..
601316,ckrb2007,2011-07-11 01:32:00,449,"I just got back from 2 weeks of kawartha fishing. The Abu Verdict/Abu Revo combo was spooled with 50lb Sufix 832 to try it out. I really have no complaints other then my reel is all green from the dye coming off. I was happy with the performance especially the casting distance. Also, kinda weird but I found that it wasn't as noisy as PPro when reeling in a fish. I'd buy it again for sure but I am partial to PPro.  Cheers, Colin"
601337,coreyhkh,2011-07-11 01:54:00,163,"I use 20 pound on all my spinning reels and I have had know problems with the stuff, I also use Powerpro and its goof but it does not cast as good. When people have problems with line I find its 99% user error."
601340,BillM,2011-07-11 02:03:00,17367," Who's talking about spinning outfits here?  If I had highframes on my St.Croix Avid, I doubt I'd have any line wrap issues either, lol.."
601505,umKthxbye,2011-07-11 15:10:00,247,I agree 100% on user error. The only time I got tip wrap was when I tried to set the hook and there was nothing to set in so the line just came flying back. When I put the tip down to start reeling in the line was wrapped. That to me is user error. I'm talking baitcaster.
600610,BillM,2011-07-08 16:26:00,17367,"I've been fishing this line for a few weeks (3+ days a weeks since pike opener) here are a couple of my impressions for anyone that is thinking of taking the plunge.  1. Line casts pretty good, I don't know how much better it is then the Suffix High Performance braid I had on my Calais before.  If it's an improvement, it's nothing crazy.  2. I've NEVER had a line that likes to wrap around the guides like this before.  Set the hook, miss a fish, get out of a snag and you'll be unwrapped line from your guides.  Drives me insane (Never had this issue with PPro, the old Suffix or even Fireline)  3. Colour bleed..  Not really a big deal to me, all braid likes to bleed.  Is about as bad as PPro is...  4. Random line breakage.  Have had this a few times, this line isn't as tough as PPro for sure...  I've had 4 line snaps in the past 3 weeks, weird.   Worth the hype?  I don't think so."
600613,mbosh1980,2011-07-08 16:29:00,349,"Thanks for the input. The braid I've got on my reels should last  bit, but good to see some honest opinions on here."
600614,mbosh1980,2011-07-08 16:30:00,349,
600615,mbosh1980,2011-07-08 16:30:00,349,how did I do that now...jeesh
600618,Terry,2011-07-08 16:33:00,14456,I was not as pleased as I thought I would be with it  lots of wrapping around the tip
600619,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-08 16:34:00,2690,"Hey, Bill!  Used it for four outings.  Definited color bleed, but, not an issue for me either. No problems with breakage, pulled up some pretty good structure with it Haven't noticed it wrapping around my guides. Love the way it casts.  Overall, I'd say if you can get it for $14.99 definitely worth it.  Like I said, though, only used it for four trips."
600623,BillM,2011-07-08 16:41:00,17367," Ok, so I'm not going crazy  :)"
600624,Old Man,2011-07-08 16:42:00,822,"Roughly the same impression I had with it after a month of using it.  I found it cast better than PP, color bleed was worse than PP, tangled way more than PP, never had any problem with random breakage.  That said, I switched both the wife's and my rigs back to Power Pro the other day. The tangeling was driving us crazy. Been out 3 times with the PP and things have been way better."
600625,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-08 16:42:00,2690, Are you guys using it on baitcaster or spinning rigs?  Or both  ?
600632,Lunkerhunter,2011-07-08 16:47:00,455,"i have it on several reels, definetely notice a bit better casting distance than the ppro.  i do not notice the line twist however i always use a swivel.  the color bleed on mine is inconsistent. on some of my reels it has turned almost white it has bled so much. on 1 of my reels it hasnt bled at all. weird. not too much of an issue for me though as i use flourocarbon leader most of the time.  i havent had any line breaks and have caught 19 muskie on the one combo.. 4 over 40 inches too. seems to be pretty solid.  overall impressions is that its not that much better if at all than power pro. my original impression was that it was better, but the more i use it the more and more things i notice."
600633,BillM,2011-07-08 16:47:00,17367, Baitcaster..   6lb Fireline Crystal on my spinning rigs.  LunkerHunter: I didn't have any issues with line twist either    It's the fact that it's wrapping around the guides that I (and Terry) have an issue with.  Maybe to limp for it's own good
600634,Harrison,2011-07-08 16:47:00,2202,"I found it way too limp.  So I soaked it in some viagara and bingo - no more tip problems.  Sorry, had to.  Seriously, I used it once on a windy day and switched back to my regular power pro."
600636,BillM,2011-07-08 16:49:00,17367,  LOL!!!!
600643,Dan668,2011-07-08 16:56:00,1120,"Tried it out last week. in the low test range its pretty good on my spinning reel, had zero problems. Colour bleed, thats about it. But for baitcasters, still doesnt match up to 55lb daiwa samurai. My favourite line."
600646,Nipfisher,2011-07-08 16:57:00,2449,On my spinning reels I switched from mono to 832. I am running the 20 # and don't have issues with breakage. It has completely bled and looks like dental floss now. I get some wrapping around the tip but never around the guides. I have 50 # PP on my Castaic and I get it wrapped around the tip too? I bought the 50# 832 and haven't tried it out yet.
600651,asdve23rveavwa,2011-07-08 17:01:00,2690," I've been using the 20 lb on a spinning outfit with bucktails, no issues with the tangles. Did load up my new baitcast combo with it...I'm curious to see if I get the tangles you and a few others have been."
600652,FrankTheRabbit,2011-07-08 17:03:00,479,"I've been using the 30lb test on my spinning reel on a 7ft rod. I haven't noticed any more or less wrap arounds than float fishing with mono. I find that it does wrap around the guides when I raise my rod up to untangle my bait.  Casting seems nice and the colour fade has been slight so it's still green. Not as dark as when it once was in the packaging. I haven't hooked onto anything more than 5lbs and the line held its own.  The only thing I do notice is it does fray slightly. When I tie knots onto my swivels, the tag end does fray. If you have a knick in your line, it would be best to cut & retie.  I bought my stuff when it was on sale at CT. For that price, it performs very nicely. Regular priced 832 is not worth the premium.  I've come to the conclusion that there's some quality control issues. It seems that there are batches of 832 that perform and under perform to their standards. That's not how a spool of regularly priced ($24) braid should be."
600653,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-07-08 17:08:00,1107,"I have used it quite a bit now 65lb,40,30,20lb I have noticed with the 20 it wraps on the tip but I just point the tip at the water and shake it and it's off no problem with breakage or bleeding so far I like this braid better than anything else I have tried"
600662,Roy,2011-07-08 17:31:00,13728,"It only wraps around the guides eh? HAHAHAHAHA That's a relief.  Hey Gordie! Last night I dreamed I was fishing with a flexible carrot. That's beautiful, Frank, call production and marketing, tell'em I want a million units on the market next month. We'll call'em Carrot Stix!  Hey boss, consumer research says the fishing geniuses want to match the hatch. Go for it, Gordie! But boss, the only colours we have left in the paint department makes a kind of a monkey puke colour. Close enough Gord......put'em out there. They'll buy'em.  Blood red hooks to imitate injured prey? But boss, I hear that underwater the red appears as a dark grey or black. As long as it looks like red when it's on the shelves Gordo.... Gotcha boss.   I'm really glad you guys aren't into sky diving."
600663,BillM,2011-07-08 17:33:00,17367," When I bring a fish in, it sounds just like any other braid does.  I'm sure the guys fishing it with spinning rods have less issues with guide wrap then the baitcast guys do seeing that their guides are usually highframe and way off the blank."
600668,kickingfrog,2011-07-08 17:39:00,8333,"I've barly used the 832 so far. My initial impression was that there was not much difference, good or bad. But not enough time/use to really say at this point.  Is it a new rod?"
600669,BillM,2011-07-08 17:41:00,17367," New rod?  No, I've landed hundreds of fish on this thing.  Only thing new in the equation is the line"
600671,kickingfrog,2011-07-08 17:45:00,8333, Just spitballin'.  Is the line diameter the same what was on the rod previously?
600672,BillM,2011-07-08 17:47:00,17367," Yup.. I think it's the 'limpness' of this new line that's most likely the issue.  When wet it likes to lay down on the blank anytime there is slack and wraps itself up.  Perhaps I'll have to try some on my spinning outfits and see how it goes.   Perhaps maybe even moving up to 30-40lb might help on the baitcaster, currently running 20lb."
600673,mercman,2011-07-08 17:48:00,7054," Nope, you are not crazy, but the line wrap is driving me totally nuts So much so, that i may never use it again."
