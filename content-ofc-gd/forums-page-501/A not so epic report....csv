612653,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-16 18:10:00,0,"A few status update requests for a report so I figured I'd share what I had.  As some of you may recall I previously enjoyed making 5-10 minute videos for each of my adventures but I just haven't had the time!  The last year has been crazy for me to say the least.  After being laid off from my job working in Sea Lamprey Control, I decided that I wanted to get into something that had more opportunity.  Getting laid off every year was getting old, and traveling all summer long wasn't easy on the family.  I decided I would apply for funding to go back to school!  This past year I took a welding course at a local private college, which I graduated from in June.  Since then I've been trying to find a job and haven't dedicated the amount of time I typically do to fishing.  I'm sure all you fellas (and ladies) with kids etc. know about this all too well.  When I have gotten out this summer, it was often close to home, most often on the St. Mary's River system. The fishing has been decent, but I typically didn't take the number of photos and videos I used to.  Right at the top of my fishing neglect list is bass fishing.  Typically I have spent up to 20 days on the water fishing for bass in july and august, this year it's been 2.  Last night, my father-in-law and took to the back country to catch some smallies.  For 45 minutes we searched for fish and only caught a few small bass.  At around 7pm last night we started to get into fish and before I knew it we couldn't do wrong.  In very short order we managed to get about 40 bass between the 2 of us.  I would wager that half of these fish were caught fishing underneath the boat (there was dozens of bass all around us).  It was by far the craziest frenzy of action I have ever seen.  Fish were herding minnows in the shallows, jumping all around, and hitting everything from small jigs to topwater.  It was totally awesome and something I really needed.  I only took a few pics but it was just too fun to worry about.  Here are the two nicest fish for each of us.  Cheers.   "

Its ashame because i really like being able to look back at old photos and being able to show friends and family, and we all know pics or it didn't happen...LOL"
612657,Rod Caster,2011-08-16 18:26:00,5784,Gotta love a good bass frenzy. Good luck with the new career moving forward. How was the walleye fishing the other night? Any keepers?
612658,johnnyb,2011-08-16 18:33:00,3413,BEAUTIES!!!!  Nicely done sir
612659,bushart,2011-08-16 18:35:00,2628,Looks good doc.  Glad to see you washin out those old Budweiser cans to drink water in the boat---atta way to think conservation
612663,Cookslav,2011-08-16 19:06:00,1457,Nice look'n smallies! Those black tanks are AWESOME on top water when they are willing to commit.  Love those skitter pops....they are by far my favorite top water baits.
612665,Grimace,2011-08-16 19:08:00,2020,"Good for you on the outing.  Good luck with your career, I hope something really good pops up for you.  Those really good fishing days mean so much more when you do not get out as much.  I had a 15 salmon night a couple of weeks back and it was extra sweet because I do not go out nearly as often anymore due to long hours and a little boy.  Glad you got into a bunch. Cheers."
612699,mercman,2011-08-16 20:55:00,7054,"Doc, those aint Bass, they is 'Holy Cows.' !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Really nice ones too  Thanks   Paul"

612709,rufus,2011-08-16 21:36:00,267,A couple of beauts! Sounds like you hit the motherload and had a heck of an evening. Terrific!
612710,irishfield,2011-08-16 21:39:00,26272,Looked like a great night out Lucas !
612715,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-16 21:57:00,0, The nerve of some anglers.  It would seem that some irresponsible idiots left 2 cold beer sitting on a rock at the far end of the lake.  My father in law and I saw fit to empty them on the shore and transport the 2 empties back to town  for a 20 cent deposit.  A guys gotta put gas in the snowmobile somehow!
612721,bushart,2011-08-16 22:16:00,2628,I hear ya Doc and applaud your green perspective  After Terry's Camera episode at the fly in I would hate to see any mix-ups on film.
