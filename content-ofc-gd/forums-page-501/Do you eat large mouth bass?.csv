611595,Nipfisher,2011-08-12 13:48:00,2449,  Wow Rod Caster said the rock bass stunk up his condo. My largie just stunk up my kitchen.
611600,Nipfisher,2011-08-12 14:01:00,2449,  What exactly is a good sized rock bass?
611664,Bernie66,2011-08-12 18:24:00,123, I've caught some over a pound in cooks bay. Tasty.
611703,bigreddog,2011-08-12 20:56:00,84,= Anything that doesn't make you feel like you're wasting your life away cleaning.  It's all pretty subjective.
612003,steelie hunter,2011-08-14 04:09:00,55,Why eat them when you can release them? They are a great fighting sport fish!!
612027,Black_Blade,2011-08-14 12:11:00,258,"all I've ever been able to catch have been bass, with the odd pike here and there, and have never minded the taste of either species of bass.  Fish Crisp is darn good stuff!"
612028,Black_Blade,2011-08-14 12:12:00,258,Wife is a picky fish eater and also likes bass.
612228,crappieperchhunter,2011-08-15 09:56:00,2582, I thought I was the only one. Walleye for table fare are the most over rated fish on the planet IMHO. A cottage in the Kawartha's and I have not kept one for the table for years now. Crappies Bluegills and any good sized perch are all I harvest for the table up there.
611408,Nipfisher,2011-08-11 20:13:00,2449,"Just curious if anyone eats LMB and how they cook them? I have had SMB quite a bit but Rod Caster was surprised when I said I would keep the largie.  Stunk when I filleted it, will it taste good with a little fish crisp?"
611413,asdve23rveavwa,2011-08-11 20:21:00,2690,"I have eaten both, probably been about 10 years since I've eaten either though. Soaking them in milk will help. Bass have turned into a strictly catch and release fish for me.  Most of the time, the waters that I catch them in have plenty of panfish if I do want a meal."
611419,mercman,2011-08-11 20:31:00,7054,"I eat LMB, and i really like it.I guess the taste chages from one place to the other, depending on what they eat. I either deep fry them in batter, or even better, tin foil, butter, garlic, and a touch of Cattle Boyz BBQ sauce, put a scallion on each fillet. Oven at 3235f for 20-25 minutes. I find LMB very lite tasting, almost bland.You have to spice it up a little bit.  "
611420,misfish,2011-08-11 20:31:00,29133," As a kid growing up and fishing with my pop,we kept  smallies for the fry. They tasted like fish. I have tried one large mouth, my whole life and it tasted like ,,crap.  Butter milk is the best for soaking IMO."
611429,Jigs,2011-08-11 20:47:00,136, BBQ sauce with freshwater fish huh? Interesting....I'll have to try that.
611431,Pikeslayer,2011-08-11 20:53:00,1443,No & maybe.  I like pike.  Slayer
611432,mercman,2011-08-11 20:53:00,7054,  Not just any BBQ sauce. Cattle Boyz Just ask MM how he likes that stuff
611435,Nipfisher,2011-08-11 21:00:00,2449,O.K. I'll give it a go. Thanks guys. I'll try the batter and pan fry method 1st and save the fancy stuff for when I'm trying to impress someone.
611438,Terry,2011-08-11 21:04:00,14456,if you put enough sauces and batters and vinegar ketchup and what not you can make a rubber boot taste OK    just saying
611439,eman,2011-08-11 21:06:00,101,I have eaten them twice in my life.....sadly I enjoyed both experiences.  My policy is stricky catch & release too. I figured the fish gods won't shine down on me when I'm warming up the skillet. Maybe why I never seem to catch pickeral!
611440,mike rousseau,2011-08-11 21:06:00,4661,Cattle boyz BBQ sauce is my new cocain...  And if you catch largies in nice clean water... Good eats... If you get them up a swampy little creek that drains all the local farm land... The lmb might taste like cow poo
611444,Rod Caster,2011-08-11 21:08:00,5784,Bbq sauce on bass... Does that make it poor man's steak?
611449,bushart,2011-08-11 21:32:00,2628,Yes  We go old school--fresh not frozen-----fried in Butter---salt/pepper--garlic powder  Like better than smb
611451,smally21,2011-08-11 21:42:00,993,"the few times i've tried LMB they have been very soft fleshed, a little gross when your thumb punches thru a fresh fillet you are trying to hold.  i think it has more to do with the water temp and ""sunbaked"" nature of the fish, when caught in an 80+ degree shallow lake the fish comes out half cooked!.  now a smally from an ice cold northern lake , seems like the flesh is firmer and much more palatable.  tried a scugog largie once - turned me off not just LMB, but shallow water fish forever."
611455,Bernie66,2011-08-11 21:59:00,123,"Personally, I like LM better than SM for table fare. The flesh is firmer I find.  You can fry the fillets up in beer batter or steam it whole with green onions, ginger and soy sauce. That's how they cook them in the chinese restaurants.  Check out the chinese markets down in T.O., they sell farmed LMs. They call them green bass and you can order it in the local eateries."

611463,Ron,2011-08-11 22:47:00,1683,"Anyone that has ever fished Lingham Lake and did not eat Large mouth bass or Small mouth bass from that lake has missed out on some of the best tasting fish in Ontario. when we went into Lingham, we went with canoe, fish was our staple for dinner every night."
611476,Rizzo,2011-08-11 23:53:00,4754,eat a largemouth?? Might as well drink a cup of bilge water to wash it down...yuck   (mind you I can barely choke down pickerel so possibly not your most reliable source for opinion)
611485,fish_fishburn,2011-08-12 00:43:00,1311,"I don't eat Smallies there gross.  But if I deep hook a largie I have no problem eating them. I cut it in bite size chunks then beer batter and deep fry, good eats right there."
611496,Dave Bailey,2011-08-12 01:12:00,1641," So, if a largemouth tastes like crap, do crappie taste like largemouth?"
611497,Roy,2011-08-12 01:20:00,13728,I hear that if you dip'em in garlic butter they become poor man's lobster.
611510,Nipfisher,2011-08-12 02:54:00,2449,  Flesh was firm as pike. A little more reddish in colour but still looked like fish. I'll let you all know how it tastes tomorrow.
611567,Rod Caster,2011-08-12 12:33:00,5784,"Did you keep it's face as a puke bucket, just in case?"
611574,johnnyb,2011-08-12 12:51:00,3413,"I love'em....have eaten plenty.  Toss up between them and smallmouth....I've had some nasty smallies....not too many unpleasant largies though.  This year, I've been grilling most of them. Fillet gets seasoned with whatever (salt, lemon-pepper, sweet chili, oregano are just a few) and I plop it down on a hot grill...flip it once...it's done when it gets flaky.  I thought it would be pretty dull with no grease or butter....but it's great."
611588,bigreddog,2011-08-12 13:34:00,84,"I've eaten both -- but I think it's critical that they're basically fresh out of the water -- more so than other fish.  Even then, it's not something I'd want to do more than once or twice a year.  It just doesn't compare to walleye or crappie, or even a good sized rocky."
