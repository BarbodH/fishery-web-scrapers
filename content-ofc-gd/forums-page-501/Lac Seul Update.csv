612510,WeedLine,2011-08-16 01:50:00,322,Why can't I catch muskies like that? Great job Ben

612534,limeyangler,2011-08-16 03:49:00,5204,   LOL...i know what you mean Joey...and i live here!   Awesome as per usual Ben...hope to catch up with you on BiG Sandy for some whities after your busy season is done.
612738,ehg,2011-08-16 23:17:00,2666,WOW! Lac Seul must surpass Lake of the Woods for greatest multi-species freshwater fishing. It must take super skills and determination to hit that many brutes. Thanks for sharing.
612743,trapshooter,2011-08-16 23:25:00,1234,"Hey gang, thanks for the great feedback.  I feel truly privileged to live here and fish these waters. Lac Seul is a fisherman's paradise, no question."
611919,trapshooter,2011-08-13 21:39:00,1234,"With a day off the water here I decided it was time to get caught up with everyone on the OFC.  First, I can't believe how fast the season has flown by.  Summer is going to quickly become fall in NW Ontario.  I already have a tree in my yard that is turning yellow and dropping leaves.  Anyhow, fishing has been great this summer.  Lots and lots of walleye, some big pike and big muskie as well.  Didn't put a lot of effort into bass or lake trout this summer but still got a few nice ones.  I'll let the pictures do most of the talking rather then blabbing on and on.  Here's a sample of some of the nicer fish from this season.  WALLEYE              My wife with a nice one that she caught.      MUSKIE - it has been a great season for catching muskie on Lac Seul.  Lots of action, some near misses and some great fish in the net.  This is what I live for!!  Why not start it off with a bang!  This fish was on the 3rd day of the season and was the 3rd muskie in my boat.  It ate a Jimmy on the 1st spot of the day, 10 casts in.  Biggest I've guided yet this year @ 53.5""  A real Lac Seul fatty!  Another chunk for my buddy Dave... just a hair under 50""   Love this release shot too.   New PB for me this summer @ 51-inches.  Definitely helped ease the pain of losing one about the same size earlier that day!     Some more muskies....            This is a 52-incher that ate a top-water bait at dusk.  I'd been chasing this fish for a couple weeks!   These next 3 were all caught in one evening.       Another one for Brett from Thorne Bros.  We have good luck together!   These next fish were part of a 4 fish day.  Could have been 5 fish but I lost a big one.  Talk about a game of highs and lows!  The 2 mid-forty's fish I got helped ease the pain though.  They've been hitting good lately in the first hour after the sun goes down.        Thought this was a muskie.... but I'll take a 41"" pike any day of the week!    Here's a couple lake trout we jigged up on Big Vermilion lake.  Definitely fun for a change!      They don't run very big on that lake but when you can catch fifty lakers in the 3-6# range in a day it's all good fun.  Looking forward to heading up to Richter Lake with some OFNers Sept 3-10 on the Eddie North trip.  That's going to be here before we know it!!  After that back to chasing muskie until freeze up.  Yes... it's an ADDICTION!!  haha.  Cheers and good fishing everyone,  ben"

611926,danc,2011-08-13 21:58:00,4677,Some really awesome fish there Ben. Always nice to see a post from you. I've driven past that lake way too many times. As recent as last Wednesday in fact. One of these days I'm going to pull over and have a closer look.

611932,trapshooter,2011-08-13 22:08:00,1234, Let me know if you're coming through Sioux Lookout Dan and we can try to line something up.
611939,Hooked,2011-08-13 22:22:00,891,I have a strange feeling that some day I should fish that lake.   Never seen so many quality sized fish.  I would definitely say you have had a good summer so far!  Nicely done is an understatement.
