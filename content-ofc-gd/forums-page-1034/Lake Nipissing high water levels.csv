North Bay Nugget Article:  Lake levels ‘not at any critical stage’ Posted By Dave Dale Posted 11 hours ago Lake Nipissing is filling up with recent rainfall pushing the water level to the top of its operating range and the flow out of the French River is above the long-term average.  But a Ministry of Natural Resources official said the heavy volumes feeding the lake are “trending down” and little precipitation is expected in the near future.  “We’re not at any critical stage in any sense,” said Phil Hall, ministry lands and water specialist and chairman of a group of watershed representatives and dam operators.  The Sturgeon-Nipissing-French-Wanapitei Water Management Group held its weekly telephone conference call Monday when Lake Nipissing was 14 centimetres above the long-term average.  Public Works Canada, which operates the dams on the French River, reported it is 20 cm above the long-term average at Dry Pine Bay, which equates to 45 cubic metres per second more than the average.  Hall said the 40 millimetres of rainfall on the weekend, followed by more Wednesday, is pushing the lake upward to the top of the range this morning.  He said Lake Nipissing was at  195.92 metres above sea level Thursday morning and the top of the operating range (for watercraft navigation and shoreline properties) is 195.95 metres.  It could still handle a bit more, Hall said, although strong easterly winds could cause wave action that might damage shoreline properties such as Jocko Point.  He was told the walleye spawn hit its peak last week and the lake and French River levels have been good from the start.  “The trick is you don’t want to spill all of the water at once . . . you need to support a decent flow to protect the eggs (in the French River),” he said, while keeping enough water in Lake Nipissing for navigation purposes in case June and July are dry."
199354,Muskieman,2008-05-09 22:56:00,2472,I'll tell ya that the Sturgeon River dam is running full rip !  { Sturgeon River is the largest and main tributary to Nipissing}  No signs of letting up   ..they have a week to shut them down or minimize the flow.. if they can't the Opening day will be ruined next weekend for the river fishermen and 1k from the mouth... all though these conditions usually bring a spectacular Pike opportunity in Cache Bay.... The water is very stained right now... kinda like a double double  but is slowly clearing.  I'm keeping a close eye on it ... 'cause I'll be one of those fishermen next weekend!  If i see that the water hasn't cleared up or the water flow hasn't diminished I'll opt for a little lake north of here.  :Gonefishing:   Randy from Sturgeon.

There's no way I'll get my boat up there next weekend if conditions don't change   it's pretty wild under the bridges right now. You took that pic from the Cannon at the Legion.."
