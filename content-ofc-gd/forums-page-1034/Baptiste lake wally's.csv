I think that you would be much better off targeting pike which are plentiful in the lake.  The walleye that I have caught have come on a variety of lures including; Benos, Shad Raps, Canadian Wigglers, Erie Dearies, and spinner baits.  I have found Thomson 5 o Diamonds to be effective on pike.  Spinner baits and rattle baits work well on pike too.  I believe that Baptiste Lake Marina rents boats, they are on Baptiste Lake Road South."
