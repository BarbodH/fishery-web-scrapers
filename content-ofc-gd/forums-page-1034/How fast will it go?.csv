199741,ccmtcanada,2008-05-11 02:02:00,7971,"I have a 14 foot aluminum, no flooring, large deep cycle battery, 30 lb thrust trolling motor, 18hp mercury motor, say 100 pounds of gear.  Bly and I had it out today at had it running full out for the first time since we bought it.  The GPS clocked us going at 21.2 mph (34 km/h) on pretty calm waters.  Not sure how much weight the floors weigh, but if it's just you in there, you should be able to beat our speed."
