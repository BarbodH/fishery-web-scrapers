All pike were caught on frozen smelts lol People were slamming crappies at the same spot, green and white jigs seemed to do the trick. Decided to keep 2 for some fish fry, here are pics  "

199865,CLofchik,2008-05-11 14:16:00,854,"Did you cure your smelts with anything? Frozen smelts are usually pretty soft, I like to cover them with a pile of sea salt or pickling salt and let them sit in the fridge for a day before I use them.  They harden up and hold a hook a lot better.  Works well on shrimp also, makes good catfish & trout bait."
199965,Marko,2008-05-11 19:12:00,854,"No i didnt cure then with anything, just let them thaw for a bit and used them like that. Went through a 1lb bag in 3-4 hours, two guys fishing. The only reason why we used them cuz sobeys was on our way and the tackle store was on the other side of the city lol"
