Friday I found a few nice Crappie in the hurricane point area. I talked to a local who said they had been in the bay I was fishing all week but had moved out recently... Like I should feel better? Anyway, Saturday I went back to my old haunts near Buckhorn and caught 40 with my neighbour and his daughter. Here are some blurry photos of 11 inch + fish taken by the 8 year old... please excuse my hamming it up for the little girl...grin.   "
