199971,splashhopper,2008-05-11 19:19:00,2931,"I tried a ""wooly bugger"" on an 6lb main line with a 4'-4lb leader and no wait or float on Saturday in a little hole i was fishing. Just jigging it up and down under a tree.. WHAMMMO!  Rainbow hit it so hard I almost dropped my rod !  Lost the fish after a minute as I couldn't really tell how deep he was because I couldnt see the swivel where my mainline atttached to the leader. ( That's my excuse and I am sticking to it to! lol)  Then i tried putting the little jig under the float to no avail.  So i go back to the first set up and WHAMMO! Another one nails it and i just played it right out till he was done! ( fried him up on shore about 30 minutes later too)  So my question is:  How the heck do i fish those jigs in other spots on the river ? Under a float?  Straight line  and leader and weight  and with some kind of marker on it?   Any suggestions ( with pics) would be great.  Thankx  splashopper"

200062,splashhopper,2008-05-11 22:16:00,2931,usually a regular float but can use a slip float if need be.
