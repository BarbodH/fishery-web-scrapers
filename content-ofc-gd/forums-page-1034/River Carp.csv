199532,mattyk,2008-05-10 13:47:00,2110,Well I used some advice from some people here on hair rigs and some bollies. I ended up with 2 nice carp this morning. My first U.S. carp. Put up a great fight.    
199556,shane,2008-05-10 15:09:00,652,HA HA!  American carps are just as pretty as Canadian Carps.  Nice catch.
