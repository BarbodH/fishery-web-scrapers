198389,e-z-out,2008-05-08 02:37:00,1052,  Thats what the wife said. I'll see what i can do since i know i'm already looking at a $300 rental for the 3 days weekend.
198392,e-z-out,2008-05-08 02:40:00,1052,Thanks again to all that helped in finding me a rental boat for the long weekend. This has to be one of the best sites for help when it comes to fishing and info. My hat is off to all of you may the fishing gods help you land the big ones this year.
200036,e-z-out,2008-05-11 21:37:00,1052,Well bad news people looks like i'll be boatless again Oak Shores Marina cant rent me the boat since i need to tow it to Buckhorn and they dont have any boat trailers left. Guess i'm out of luck once again So back to looking for a boat rental
200050,Beans,2008-05-11 22:00:00,3339,"Seeing as how you are only a short drive up the road from Oak Shores, why not leave the boat docked at Oak Shores and drive over there when you want to use it...as Meely said you got your choice of three different lakes to fish in...?"
200057,e-z-out,2008-05-11 22:07:00,1052,Thats true Beans but i realy love fishing Lower Buckhorn i've been fishing that lake as long as i can remember. I guess if all plans fail i'll have to fish another lake
197957,e-z-out,2008-05-07 14:46:00,1052,Well by the looks of it i wont have my boat for the May24th long weekend since the dealer messed up on my order when ordering my boat. Delay time 3 weeks. All the boat rentals in Buckhorn have been filled for the May24th long weekend. So what dose one do now????????????? Any idea guys?  Any one know of somone or some place in the Kawartha Lakes that would rent me a boat for 3 day. I've checked the net and have found a few places but all booked for the long weekend.
197958,Meely,2008-05-07 14:49:00,282,Check Oak Shores Marina. They are located on Little Bald Lake which connects to Pigeon Lake.  http://www.profilecanada.com/companydetail...a_Bobcaygeon_ON  Meely
197965,e-z-out,2008-05-07 15:10:00,1052,Thanks Meely just tryed calling them but the phone just keeps rining. Will have to try them later
197974,JohnAB,2008-05-07 15:25:00,178,"Geesh, dealers fault, does he not have a boat in stock he can let you use for the weekend?"
197983,e-z-out,2008-05-07 15:33:00,1052,  Asked him that already. He dose and it's a little 8 footer with paddles. if it comes down to it i'll end up taking what i can. I just want to fish it was a long winter and we all know how that can be. You spend 32gs and get a 8 footer with paddles for your long weekend. this sucks big time
197992,Golfisher,2008-05-07 15:57:00,586, I suppose it could have been a canoe.  But this gotta hurt a bit.
197993,e-z-out,2008-05-07 16:03:00,1052,  It hurts alot already I guess in the end i'll be fishing from shore. I hope i find a boat to rent soon
198004,Garry2Rs,2008-05-07 16:19:00,1425,"My neighbour has a 14 foot tinny with a 9.5 Johnson that he wants to sell for about a $1100.00 I think I could persuade him to rent it, but what do you think would be a fair offer for the long weekend? The boat doesn't come with a trailer, so unless you have roof racks, or a pick-up, he would have to deliver it... You might want to throw a few extra bucks in the offer for delivery."
198027,Casey123,2008-05-07 16:44:00,461," I didn't know they made them that small, my float tube is almost as big! LOL  Oh man does that suck"
198028,e-z-out,2008-05-07 16:46:00,1052,"  Hey garry how close are you to SUNRISE RESORT is located beside Lock 31 in Buckhorn at the junction of Hwy #23 (old 507) and 36, 32 km. north of Peterborough?  Would he rent it for 150 for saturday May 17th to sunday May 18th? and 50 to drop it off and pick it up later? I'm just guessing prices let me know if hes ok with that or if hes willing to rent to boat out first."
198029,e-z-out,2008-05-07 16:49:00,1052,  Yes they do make them that small I'm stressing over nothing. I'm happy just fishing and getting out of the city with the wife a my little one.
198030,Casey123,2008-05-07 16:52:00,461,"Aile your right, while it sucks not to have your own boat, it is better to dwell on the fact that you will have time to spend with your wife and child. It is a long weekend and you will be nowhere near the big smoke.   The only thing you may consider is the following:  Your wife and you might have to take turns going out in the boat as it may not fit two adults!   Just teasing, no matter what happens enjoy the time away."
198033,e-z-out,2008-05-07 16:57:00,1052,  Thanks for the kind words 4reel. I love fishing it keeps me happy and always smiling. the little one will hav e her first fishing trip this year already have her gear. Picked up a few things for her at BPS on the weekend for this trip.
198056,Garry2Rs,2008-05-07 17:50:00,1425,"Give me until this evening to present your offer, I will get back to you by Six PM. I know Sunrise and often launch there, so the drop-off and pick-up will be no problem."
198060,e-z-out,2008-05-07 17:58:00,1052,  Sweet thanks again Garry hope he goes for it.
198148,Garry2Rs,2008-05-07 21:13:00,1425,"Sorry AILE; He said that because that is the May 2-4 weekend he's not interested in renting the boat. This is the weekend that most people open their cottages, and he wants the boat here where people going by can see that it's for sale. I tried to reason with him that a ""bird in the hand was worth two in the bush,"" but he wouldn't budge. Again, I'm sorry for getting your hopes up, but I'm sure we can both see his point. Garry2R's"
198158,e-z-out,2008-05-07 21:26:00,1052,  Well garry you tried and all i can say is thank you very much. I understand and can only hope somone on the fourms can help me out. But if nothing i'll be more then happy to fish from shore with the family.
198163,Meely,2008-05-07 21:35:00,282,"Hey AG ,  I just called Oak Shores Marina and spoke with a Margaret. She mentioned she has a 14 and 16 footer available still....... HURRY !!!  Meely"

198173,e-z-out,2008-05-07 21:52:00,1052," Sweet i called them again and booked the 14"" footer for the weekend. Meely you just made my weekend even better thanks again."
198175,Meely,2008-05-07 21:56:00,282,"No probs. I'm glad it worked out for ya. From the marina, you have access to a ton of water (Little Bald, Big Bald Lake, and Pigeon). Not sure if your staying in Buckhorn but its only a 10 min drive if u are.  Maybe I'll see you on the water.   Meely"
198176,Dondorfish,2008-05-07 21:57:00,1000,I just love happy endings!   Don  
198295,HTHM,2008-05-08 00:19:00,4082,Backcharge the cost of the rental to the marina that you are getting your new boat from.
198308,ccmtcanada,2008-05-08 00:42:00,7971,Great stuff...this community comes through for someone again!!  Hat's off to Meely and everyone else who tried to help out!
