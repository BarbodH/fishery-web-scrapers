Weathers nice, get off work at noon , what to do uhmmm, call my buddy Kevin and make plans to fish the upper niagara river on the N.y side for bass, get there around 5 p.m and start out quest for our first of the season bass, Kevin nails a nice one right away drop shotting a poor boy gobie...  Drift some more nothing, must have been a lucky fish, so we head over to around the Grand Island bridge and decide to change tactics, this time it's the x-rap , bang Kevin nails another fatty...    nothing much after that, took some nice pics of the top of niagara fall on our way back in to chippawa creek, wish i could get back out today but it's mumma's day!!!
