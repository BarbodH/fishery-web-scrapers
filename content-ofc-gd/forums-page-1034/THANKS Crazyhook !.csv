Called Crazyhook while passing the Corel Centre on the 417 and went directly to his place of employment. Was really unfortunate.. but I only got to spend, at the most, 3 minutes talking to Jamie while he handed me 10 of his custom hand tied flies/jigs.  Wished I could have stayed longer Jamie.. but we had an hour to get to our daughters apartment.. get changed and be at a wedding right downtown on George St. Got there with about 10 mintues to spare and pulled into the underground parking lot to find the gate down and a note in the kiosk window ""BACK IN 10 minutes""!  Anyhow THANKS immensely for these Jamie.. they'll hopefully get put to good use on Nipigon in August and the smaller ones may see a back lake for Brookies as well in the next few weeks.  Your boat spot is reserved for fall 'ski on GBay Bud !  Cheers, Wayne"
