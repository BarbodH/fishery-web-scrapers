The wife and I work on Lake of the Woods and we were wondering if anyone knew if the Little Traverese in particular was ice free yet. We know most of the lake is now free but we need to go through the Little Traverse to get to camp. We left from Peterborough this past Tuesday and we got held up in Thunder Bay Wed to this morning, waiting for the ice to be free. We are now in Fort Frances and would like to leave tomorrow(especialy since there are no hotel rooms for tomorrow night....figures).  Anyway any info would be great.  Just other info,  As far as we could tell Rainy Lake looks ice free as do all but one lake between Thunder Bay and Fort Frances, travelling down Hwy 11.  About half the lakes between Timmins and Thunder Bay still had lots of ice on them as of Wednesdy. Nipigon was still about half covered in ice again as of wednesday but looked like it should be free by now. Not a great help but just thought I would share.  Thanks again."

Walleye season opens May 10 and anglers are eager to hit the open water. Rainy river is open for all boats and the lake is open a mile past Pine Island. The Northwest Angle Inlet is open and around the Islands they are seeing it break up with a channel of water already accessible.  Reports from the DNR Baudette area fisheries show that the current status of the Lake of the Woods walleye fishery is good. Walleye abundance and fishery health indicators show that we have a strong population on the lake.  You donâ€™t want to miss this great Walleye opener. We invite you to call now for reservations at any of our lodging facilities. Check out our web site for more information at www.lakeofthewoodsmn.com or call 1-800-382-FISH."
