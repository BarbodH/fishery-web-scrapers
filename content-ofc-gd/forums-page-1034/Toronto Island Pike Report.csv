199677,ranger520vx,2008-05-11 00:02:00,164,Well it was tough to get any over 30 inches today. Water temps upwards of 52 degrees as opposed to last weeks 43-46.  My wife and I enjoyed the morning setting hook on numerous Pike with no other boats around.     Weed is starting to grow up about 2 feet in 10-15 depths.  All fish on suspending jerkbaits with 10 second pauses between twitches.  had to get them down about 6 over 8- 10 foot depths.   Video

199752,mikeymikey,2008-05-11 02:30:00,376,"wow great, atleast you caught few. i've had only one follow, two swim & one small one hooked today.  maybe i should pause more than 2 seconds between jerk.   Question:  are you using a leader?  because i tried both wire and fluro (80lb) and it makes my lures sink.  Even HJ13. slowly but still~"
