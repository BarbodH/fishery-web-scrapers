Around 11:30 we headed for Buckhorn, the village, and our favourite Crappies spots. Mike, my neighbour, caught a very nice one.  14.5 inches...  My best was only 12.5 inches but it was a new PB for me....  The wind was very strong and one of the girls started to feel cold, so we called it a day after 3 hours, with enough for supper in the live well. Garry2R's"

200265,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-05-12 01:56:00,0,Thats a nice slab. Haven't had a crappie fry in awhile. I wonder if there is more meat on a 14 inch crappie or 14 inch Jumbo Perch?
