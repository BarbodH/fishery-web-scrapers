199961,splashhopper,2008-05-11 19:08:00,2931,"ok,, so I LOVE staying out on the river AAALLLLL day( and my wife is ok with it too) and I want to eat some FRESH fish right out of the river..  I carry a small napsack with me with water and usually a sandwich and some fruit.  What ways can I cook some fresh trout or crappies on the shore over an open fire. I really DON'T want to lug a cast iron pan around with some cooking oil either.  Any suggestions?  Thanks  splashopper"
199967,MuddyWater,2008-05-11 19:14:00,218,cut the head and tail of a trout and pack his gut with veggies and butter then roll it up in tinfoil and put in some coals and dont burn it lol
199970,oxcowboy,2008-05-11 19:17:00,544,"try wrapping in tin foil ad some squeeze butter with some seasoning and throw them in some hot coals for a bit.  sounds good to me, i have done this with catfish many of times.  jason"
