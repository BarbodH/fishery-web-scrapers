199229,KyleM,2008-05-09 17:15:00,218,"After fighting with mortgage lenders for 3 months, Andrea and I have finally settled on some property outside of town here in Grande Prairie, Alberta. Thank you very much to all those who PM'd me with advice on lenders! Also, thanks to Rick (bigfish) for posting his bad experience with his ledner. We were between two lenders when his story popped up, it was a no brainer for us to steer clear.  Anyhow, we decided that this place would be perfect to set up camp while we start building a log home in the next few years. It has a mobile to live in for a few years and most importantly, its out of town with 5.11 acres.  Im  north of town now aswell which will cut my commute to Great Slave Lake from 8 hours to 7 hours and 40 min lol  All comming into the backyard... Elk Deer Moose Black and the odd Grizzly bears     "

199353,OhioFisherman,2008-05-09 22:56:00,6623,"Officially Trailer Trash!!!  you need a pick up on blocks in the picture to qualify for the elitist position of trailer trash, not everyone is acceptable. Maybe your trailer in my neighbors back yard will get you approved?  Nice looking place!"
199358,KyleM,2008-05-09 23:04:00,218,"I can arrange for a few pick-ups.....need something for my cat to live in LOL  Peter, I have a kitchen/vanity/bar business going. Right now Im installing kitchens for 5 major builders in town here...P&G Kitchens is subcontracting me out for now.   Andreas working for a great denta office in town as a dental assistant.  How are they liking it out here?  I remember talking to you about it over PM. You came home and left them out here did you?  My girlfriend would like to do the same to me.  Cookslav's little brother was out here for awhile but I think he's heading back to Ontario."
199414,Cookslav,2008-05-10 01:49:00,1457,"Yup...my brother was in Grande Prarie, and is in Calgary now, but was ""supposed"" to be comming Back in the Summer, but just prolonged it indefinately. He wants to save up some more Cash LOL...  I Heard it grows on trees out there  Kyle thats a Nice spot you got there, I'm Jealous.... I'd consider the move myself...the Wife...not in this life time.  But if I ever get that Great slave trip hooked up, maybe I'll just get stuck"

199500,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-05-10 11:00:00,1362,Nice piece of property you got there Kyle  .......  what type of log home are you guys thinkin' bout putting up??.......we built a log home a few years back and it was a lot of work but well worth the sweat!!!....we absolutely love it!!!!
199502,Rich Clemens,2008-05-10 11:15:00,3131,That looks like a fantastic place KyleM ... a little envy here.   Congrats ... you'll love it there.
199522,Smokey,2008-05-10 12:42:00,1278,Very nice Kyle. Looks like you have a place to live at out there. Must be awesome seeing all the wildlife. Congrats and Good Luck out there.  Mike
199675,irishfield,2008-05-10 23:55:00,26272,Congrats Kyle ! Now you're thinking right! Nothing wrong with your plans bud. We lived in a 32 foot (normal travel) trailer for a year+ when I sold everything to start our business... with 2 kids I might add. Tuck what would be those high mortage payments on a house away for a few years and you'll be sitting pretty if you do so. Don't be tempted to spend it on frivilous things.
199751,motv8tr,2008-05-11 02:27:00,2587,Congrats Kyle!!!  Looks like an amazing spot!!!  Maureen
