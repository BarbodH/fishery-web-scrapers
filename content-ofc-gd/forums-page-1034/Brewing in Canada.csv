I made my own when I was drinking harder, even though it could be bought for around $10 a case at the time.  In the U.S. we are allowed to make 80 gallons a year per household.  What's the deal with you guys?  I still have two fermentation tanks, several cases of bottles and lots of other equipment.  I might do a little cooking one of these nights.  Two cases would last me about 2 months, unless I had one of my favorite Canadians as a guest.  One of my board member friends could handle a week's supply before breakfast.  And I haven't even met T.J."

Tennessee, I'm not sure what the legal edicts are up here in Canada for brewing your own but there are some conditions to abide to. All I can say to that is to never give any of that to minors and I always have my guests stay overnight after they've been drinking my beer.  There is also no drinking at the fishing hole unless overnight arrangements are in place. It's better to sleep under the stars than behind bars.  Cheers!  "
199922,Spiel,2008-05-11 17:39:00,9065,....Been brewing my own in the basement on and off for 20 plus years. At the height of things I was brewing as many as a dozen different types. Usually had two double batches going at a time and a cold room stuffed full of beer. Many friends would have chosen to by from me over the brewers retail generic tasteless swill because they favored mine. Problem was I was drinking it as fast as I could make it! So I gave it up and the consumption of beer for the most part (had to) and I'm giving all my equipment to some young fella that keeps asking when I'll deliver it.
