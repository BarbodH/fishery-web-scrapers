200324,e-z-out,2008-05-12 03:23:00,1052,do they look anything like this?
200325,jace,2008-05-12 03:24:00,472," yeah, they get them.  so do a lot of other fish.   a lot of saltwater fish get worms about 1mm diameter and up to a few inches long that burrow through the meat.  it's disgusting to see.   In both cases though, cook it and you're fine."
