I have been off all week fishing with my wife for Simcoe perch and Kawartha crappies since last Saturday with the exception of Wednesday. It was a very good week with lots of good fish everyday! I still haven't had enough.
199437,Mike the Pike,2008-05-10 02:46:00,3421,Well picking up my boat at the dealer had a few bugs on the new boat to iron out like lockable rod storage did not lock.
