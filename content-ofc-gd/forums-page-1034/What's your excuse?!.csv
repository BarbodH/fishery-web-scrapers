I've been working on the thing for 4 hours today. The first time of the year that I go to fire it up it's a royal pain in the butt. Then she runs great all season  I think it's time to unload it. Before I burn it.   Hookset."

Or make mom breakfast, then go to church THEN fish for the afternoon.  but I'm whistlin' while I work, and the day's almost over."
199611,OhioFisherman,2008-05-10 20:26:00,6623," LOL Phil, my son and his girlfriend are near there today, the school gathering at Cedar Point after yesterday`s prom night. Grand kids spent the night cause my wife doesn`t work till tomorrow evening.  Don`t know if Joe could carry the tackle bag with out you and Deg to help, I haven`t down sized yet. Just one of those days where I am better off inside. A very long drive for me and hard to get motivated to fish for walleyes, especially on Lake Erie."

199617,danc,2008-05-10 20:59:00,4677,"I too just got in the house after getting the boat ready most of the day. Like Roy, mine,s a 60 HP Merc 4 stroke. Mine is a 2001 though and it came with a steering wheel. You'll love it Roy. Mine started today after cranking for about half a second. And it hasn't been started since last September. Anyways I changed some fluids, lubed things up, and installed a 12 volt plug in. I bought a nice little power inverter a while ago that will come in handy. It also has a USB connection so that I can run my GPS, cell phone and MP3 player in the boat. Nice. I'm looking so forward to next weekend..."
199671,Canuck2fan,2008-05-10 23:46:00,1444,"I am not fishing right now because I am all tuckered out from fishing all afternoon..... I went into work at 5AM got done at 7:30 AM no OPP around LOL Did the grocery shopping on the way home. Watched F1 qualifying. Laughed when my dad stopped by to help my neighbour fix his car just after 9AM cause they couldn't come fishing.  Stopped by the big dam in town to get minnows it was hard slogging to get two dozen. After the attractant worked I finally caught some beauties though. However I got a parking ticket because it took so long. I got back to the car just as he was leaving the ticket and it was just 25 minutes till you didn't have to pay as well, but people were lining up for spots so I can't really complain. He said that is too bad too that I wasn't just a bit quicker the meter had just turned when he got done the car beside me sooooooo he had no choice (yeah right).... For the eight bucks for the ticket I could have bought the minnows and been fishing earlier geessshhh.  So I got 3 pike and now they are off the list for this year which is good. I forgot my hair rigs so I didn't even attempt going after carp, but I did catch a couple dozen catfish. Who seemed to enjoy the minnows more than the pike. I even caught 3 catfish on a silver spoon and that is caught like in the mouth and everything. I did accidently also snag 2 catfish too, they are attacking anything that comes near their small fry with a vengence."

Ain't gonna miss that.  This league was formed last year and lets young kids with disabilities play 3 innings of T-bal.  Everyone on the team bats each inning, everyone scores, and the last person up in the inning always hits a home run.  Game ends in a tie.  Sure is inspiring to see kids with a variety of disabilities, including wheel chairs, breathing machines, etc. play and have a great time.  Ani't gonna miss it .... if the rain stops.  Today ...
