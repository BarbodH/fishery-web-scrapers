198381,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-08 02:31:00,0,Have anyone caught any rainbows in any rivers since last weekend?  Are they still in rivers or the trout season is officially done?
198404,MJL,2008-05-08 02:54:00,2427,I imagine the headwaters of rivers and smaller creeks are pretty close to being done.  Scouted a few tribs during the past week and a lot of them were almost devoid of fish.  Bigger rivers where fish go up further will still probably have decent numbers.  In general think big.
198412,Sinker,2008-05-08 02:59:00,8692,"Lower sections should still have dropbacks in them. I'd assume water temps are still nice and cold.....so they'll stick it out for a bit yet. Some of my best steelheading has been later in the season......most guys think its over.....meanwhile, I'm fishing a pool in the lower stretches thats loaded with hungry dropbacks.  don't forget the marshmallows  Sinker"
198413,ccmtcanada,2008-05-08 03:00:00,7971,"Some dropbacks may still come back down the tribs to the big lake, but it's pretty much done until fall."
198417,Musky or Specks,2008-05-08 03:19:00,2710,I 'm sworn to secrecy but I know a spot that holds dropbacks until the water gets high in the fall again. Way up river.
198422,Toronto_Angler,2008-05-08 03:30:00,698, Is your pm box full yet? LOL!
198423,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-08 03:31:00,0,"Oh man, please tell me there are still some trout somewhere .. otherwise, i feel something empty inside of me ..  started this crazy rainbow trout fishing last Nov and got hooked on it .. have been fishing them weekends after weekends ... regardless of weather .. (I swear I will NEVER and NEVER fish in -10c weather anymore)  not to mention all gears have purchased from first centerpin, first float rod, to first everything since then ...  it has been pretty much what has kept me going for the past couple months .. and now it is over and have to wait until the fall?  oh man, there is something in my eyes ... what am i going to do? do you really expect me spending weekend and weekends with GF?"
198426,bow slayer,2008-05-08 03:50:00,1074,I catch dropbacks right to the first week of june on a couple huron tribs I fish and the best part I am usually the only one on the river. They are there fish deep holes close to the lake you will find them.
198434,Sinker,2008-05-08 04:30:00,8692,Best thing to do is get off the puter and go look for  yourself. Nobody is going to tell you that there is a pool on XXX creek loaded with dropbacks.  You'll prolly find the motherload!  Sinker
198462,Rich,2008-05-08 11:12:00,3927,Rainbows down here were pretty much gone as soon as opener hit.
198620,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-08 14:25:00,0,"I know how selfish river fishmen can be, trust me.  that is why I am asking for the rivers, not spots the reason I am asking is that I have checked out 3 of eastern tribs and havent seen anything at the lower section close to the lake .. and wonder if they are still there or gone ... so that I can plan my weekends accordingly  Cheers!"
198623,MJL,2008-05-08 14:33:00,2427," Move to Michigan for the skamania - Steelhead almost all year round  Steelhead are still around (at least for Lake O tribs I scouted) - should be there for the next little while.  With that said, expect to do a fair bit of driving.  On Wednesday my dad and I drove 300km to land 1 fish (my fish   )  If you're feeling adventurous, load up the car and head north to Lake Superior.  You've got the St. Mary's, Nipigon river, steel river, jackpine plus dozen more tribs to fish"
198624,Tacklebuster,2008-05-08 14:34:00,303,"They are still in there.  I went 1/5 the day before yesterday.  You just have to keep looking, and you will find them.  "
198803,jdmls,2008-05-08 20:24:00,575,"take a drive to Tanglebury....the steel comes in and out until about the middle of June...... On worms you will get into the football smallies too.......AFTER the opener of course, LOL"
199361,Paulus,2008-05-09 23:08:00,522,"If the same old spots aren't holding any fishing, try new spots on the same old rivers - or try new rivers. I fished mostly in the East this year, and there are still fish to be found, for sure. A map and two feet will be your best tools to help find fish this time of year  p.-"
199423,kentooley,2008-05-10 01:59:00,208,I hit the Credit this morning for a couple of hours and landed a really fresh looking male~5lbs...caught it on my first drift and thought I was going to have a banner day  ....unfortunately that was it. Would have stuck around a bit longer but it was getting pretty windy.
199445,jonnybass,2008-05-10 03:07:00,346,"LOL, some guys here are killing me!  You guys do realize that it was a LATE RUN this year right? On most of the major rivers, ALL of the steelies are still in there! The guys ""in the know"" have zip-locked mouths because they want you to stay at home while they slaughter steel.  I know first hand that a MAJOR steelhead river has 100% of the run still in the river. They're wayyyy up and just starting to come back down. You'll be smoking drop-backs into June if you're still interested.  The major runs were just entering the river mouths the week before opener... Damn, some are still spawning. You do the math.  "
199463,danc,2008-05-10 03:54:00,4677,Depends on where you are in the province. My Steelhead season starts in another month. Pre spawn fish in mid June. Can't wait...
199484,camillj,2008-05-10 06:30:00,1988,The only month its really hard to catch steel in the tribs is july/aug .... thats 10 months of serious fishin guys ... you just gotta enjoy the walk as much as the catchin
199490,l2p,2008-05-10 08:39:00,346,"^^ correction, not all tribs still have steelhead up. fished an east trib the other day worked our way from up river all the way down and found 5 fish in a 6 km strech of river. alot of fish are happily swiming out in the lake."
199626,jonnybass,2008-05-10 21:40:00,346,"Carefully re-read what I said. no need for a ""correction""."
199721,DonF,2008-05-11 01:39:00,11,Caught some nice ones Mon and Tues in the Beaver at Thornbury. My brother has been up there all week and they are still running.   
199732,Guest Fishing For Life,2008-05-11 01:54:00,0,Nice !!!!  gotta pack up to fish!
