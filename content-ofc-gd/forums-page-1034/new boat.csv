199951,Radnine,2008-05-11 18:50:00,1538,"Hi All, I took the new boat out for the first time yesterday (it is a 2008 Fish Hawk) All went very well but for the fact that I thought the steering was very “heavy” (like two hands required). Will the steering loosen up after some use (there is no tension adjustment on the steering that I know of)? Can some of my fellow ""new boat"" guys help me out on this? Thanks, Jim"
199953,danbouck,2008-05-11 18:54:00,4380,My new boat is a little stiff as well. I will be getting them to look at it.
199969,mikeh,2008-05-11 19:16:00,824,does it have a place to inject lube on the motor? mine has two fittings that I inject lube to make the motor turn better.
199977,irishfield,2008-05-11 19:26:00,26272,Tiller.. console...cable steering..rack'n pinion..hydraulic?
199978,steverowbotham,2008-05-11 19:34:00,1800,steering cable is seized up by the sounds of it
200080,OhioFisherman,2008-05-11 22:51:00,6623,"Like mikeh says there should be a couple grease fittings near the pivot point on the motor, a marine grade grease probably your best bet in them. Owners manual should mention what to use.  They also make a grease fitting that slides over the steering control shaft that attaches to the motor, just looks like a nut with a grease fitting and allows you to keep it greased, got mine on close out but the cost is 10-15 bucks."
200157,Radnine,2008-05-11 23:58:00,1538,"Hey good news! I just read the manual and there is a steering tension adjustment on the motor (page 53 Dan). By cracky, I'll have at 'er tomorrow. .........reading the manual, who'd of thunk it? Thanks all. Jim"
200189,purekgw,2008-05-12 00:44:00,585,nice boat we got a fish hawk  what size tho?
200193,ccmtcanada,2008-05-12 00:45:00,7971, Now be honest....did your wife tell you to read it?? LOL.
200293,Mike the Pike,2008-05-12 02:34:00,3421,  Funny one Cliff.  No problems with steering a tiller.
200314,POLLIWOGG,2008-05-12 03:12:00,835,Is it stiff all the time or just under way?  If its just under way you may have to adjust a trim tab behind the prop to compensate for prop walk.
200316,Pigeontroller,2008-05-12 03:14:00,2793,"""no feedback"" steering feels alittle stiff, but its nice when you let go of the wheel and don't go into a turn, and your motor stays put while trailering..."
