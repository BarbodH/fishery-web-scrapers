My mom is 75 years old and still very active in the affairs of others. She has always be a good manager and cares about tons of people, regardless of how old we (7) children are today, she still think about our affairs.  I remembered when I was 21 years old and was broken hearted once off a relationship, She gave me some advice on how to survive the ordeal , and how to handle the situation in an honorable way.  MY mom has the character similar to this passage:  10  A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.  11 Her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value.  12 She brings him good, not harm, all the days of her life.  13 She selects wool and flax and works with eager hands.  14 She is like the merchant ships, bringing her food from afar.  15 She gets up while it is still dark; she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls.  16 She considers a field and buys it; out of her earnings she plants a vineyard.  17 She sets about her work vigorously; her arms are strong for her tasks.  18 She sees that her trading is profitable, and her lamp does not go out at night.  19 In her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers.  20 She opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy.  21 When it snows, she has no fear for her household; for all of them are clothed in scarlet.  22 She makes coverings for her bed; she is clothed in fine linen and purple.  23 Her husband is respected at the city gate, where he takes his seat among the elders of the land.  24 She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies the merchants with sashes.  25 She is clothed with strength and dignity; she can laugh at the days to come.  26 She speaks with wisdom, and faithful instruction is on her tongue.  27 She watches over the affairs of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.  28 Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:  29 ""Many women do noble things, but you surpass them all.""  30 Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.  31 Give her the reward she has earned, and let her works bring her praise at the city gate."

200087,HTHM,2008-05-11 23:05:00,4082,"One of my favorite sayings I learned from her, ""Sometimes you just have to row with the oars you've got"" A great way to accept one's circumstances regardless of how good or bad they are."
