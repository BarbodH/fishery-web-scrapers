198771,fishing n autograph,2008-05-08 19:07:00,2540,"Hey guys, I'm just as fed up with little punks as everyone else...but the problem isn't the Youth Criminal Justice Act....it's not the police....it's the parents, or lack there of and it's the court system. In my opinion after working in the legal system as the idiot catcher and as a youth probation officer, it's the court system. The YCJA does work if it's used right, however in most jurisdictions the court system doesn't know how to properly implement them because there isn't a youth only court."
198776,Want,2008-05-08 19:20:00,39,"Let's face it. I don't know the stats but I'm betting that 20-30% of these young punks are going to do time in the slammer at one point or another in their lives. You know: assault and battery, aggravated assault, dangersous weapons, threatening and so on.  If they beat up innocent people now, a number of them will do a lot worse later. The problem is that they don't ""pay"" for hurting people now. These types of psychos only know one way: beat or be beat. I don't have ANY sympathy for them at all. Lock them away. They'll surely wind up there anyway."
198777,bigbuck,2008-05-08 19:21:00,2449,"We need Turkish prisons here. Wake up each day to a beating and eat bread and water for a couple of years with a hole in the floor to do your business, somehow, I don't think there would be much of a problem for repeat offenders and for them, the Chinese 9mm in the back of the would be nice. Parents are way to easy on their kids these days. I don't get people. If I had the police show up on the doorstep when I was a kid I would be begging them to take me away, jail would be preferable to the shots my dad would have given me."

198800,steverowbotham,2008-05-08 20:21:00,1800,"makes me sick.  What ever happened to a one on one throwdown?  I am not a very confrontational person, but I have seen my share of scraps, mostly stemming from multiple people beating up on one friend.  Just ridiculous.  Kids these days (I never thought I would be saying that ... I used to shake my head when my dad said it)"
198805,bpsbassman,2008-05-08 20:34:00,941,"If you can't do anything with the kids, then throw the parents in the clink for awhile.  Maybe they'll figure it out! Pure Bull."
198811,bushart,2008-05-08 21:28:00,2628,Just read on my homepage that there was a student stabbed in a east TO high school---so this ends.....where????
198823,danbo,2008-05-08 21:56:00,2646,"Where are the parents?  Both are at work trying to keep a roof over their heads. Of course there's more single Moms these days too. Society is to blame for it. Violence is everywhere in the media..try to watch your nightly News on TV without shaking your head in sorrow.. These kids need ""creative guidance"" with sports,music,art,etc..but it costs time & money. Outcast kids usually seek others of the same for friendship & protection. Thus, gang mentality creeps in..usually with one or two Disturbed kids that become leaders of the pack. Until Society steps up, this stuff will just keep spreading........"
198865,caper,2008-05-08 23:27:00,210, The YCJA is worse than the Young Offenders Act it replaced. And having a youth only court doesn't help one bit.
198881,irishfield,2008-05-09 00:01:00,26272, Now you're talking bud !  Burn a hole thru the first one... the rest don't wait for the reload!  Self defence system of choice for Truckers world wide!
198894,muskymike,2008-05-09 00:23:00,772,"If we cant abolish the YOA then at least lets publish some names and the names of their parents. As someone said earlier, shame is a motivator. Let the public know who is doing it. We have a group of kid in our neighborhood that seem to think slashing tires is fun and damaging parked cars. its not a one-off situation either, its happened a few times. Well turns out some people found out who they were and gave them a little ""talkin"" to with some help of fists and boots, they have not caused anything in our neighborhood since then. Cops were called many times and nothing was done. The whole neighborhood is in for protecting what is ours and keeping it safe for everyone. If the law cant do anything about it, citizens will unfortunately."
198906,danc,2008-05-09 00:34:00,4677," Pretty poor journalism, but I get the point. Very sad to see this happening."
198908,Andy,2008-05-09 00:35:00,330,"From the little I've read, it seems when a fellow in the military commits an offence and is placed in a military detention centre, the punishment is regimented and harsh. Yet when an person outside the military commits an offence, our punishment is often little more than a slap on the wrist with zero accountability after a phony apology blaming everyone else but themselves for their conduct. Seems strange to have such different approaches to those who offend. Andy"
198913,Mattones,2008-05-09 00:43:00,587,That is so horrible! These kids should face hefty time. But Once they start crying they will only get a slap on the wrist.
199052,Clampet,2008-05-09 10:54:00,1947,"Why is it we aren't allowed to operate a motor vehicle without first proving our worthiness by successfully passing a written test and then a driving test of our skills to obtain permission in the form of a driver's license? Would it not stand to reason, that in order to bring human beings into the world, we should be deemed fit and capable parents?  I know it sounds George Orwell(ish) (1984), but it could be done.  Every child born could have their reproductive capabilities put on hold as to such time when said hopefull parents could then could prove their ability to provide a nurturing enviro.  Many people have multiple children as a meal ticket, to support themselves.  It is not fair for the children or the taxpayers."
199884,wacky tambaqui,2008-05-11 14:56:00,33," The Y.O.A. needs to be repealed and replaced with the doli incapax clause as seen in the case of the murder of James Bulger in Liverpool:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger  If those brats want to play like grown-ups, let them pay like grown-ups. Seeing that the Canadian Injustice system seems to encourage, promote, and support that kind of behavior, we honest working folks end up the losers when the case goes to court.  We have a choice when it comes to dealing and living with brats who gain for themselves at the expense of others with such legal impunity. We can continue to have our lives ruined by such individuals and groups, or we can take matters in our own hands (albeit with high legal risk) and apply our own solution: Frontier Justice. One thing: make sure you have no witnesses who might go against you."
198705,bushart,2008-05-08 16:13:00,2628,I usually use a step stool for getting on/off my high horse.  Granted some of what you say is very true--I grew up watching Elmer blow daffy's bill everywhere but Tuesday and it did'nt make me a murderer (fish/deer excepted)  I'm far from a politically/social teaching genius but the years have taught me a few things. such as  My wife stayed home to raise our 2 kids---did we struggle --you bet--was it worth it--u bet  Anyway I'm currently formulating an opinion/overview of what this latest generation is doing.  For time and eternity every generation except the last few has had some hard issues to face--be they war/famine/disease/depression--whatever  Now us boomers and maybe post boomers worked at achieving something through the ranks and times have been good.  Now this latest group only sees the material gains and not what it took to get them nor have they had to suffer ( North America) any hard times---look at the mortgage crisis in the US--it almost took down the country.  It all boils down to instant gratification and even at that 12 year old stage it appears heading down a dangerous path and I'm not sure all the social experts do either.  Damn I fell off my step stool  Bushart

198716,brownsound1113,2008-05-08 16:38:00,5,"All these kids know that they are protected under the YOA. I'm all for giving kids a second chance, but certain things need to be severely punished. Gang violence and crimes where the safety and security of a person is threatened need to be treated as serious offences.  Also, this crap about not publishing the names is bull. The public should know which kids in society are misguided and need to be re-educated on how to live peacefully. Besides, shame can be a powerful motivator too. The shame will be the kid's and the parent's and may force some real results."
