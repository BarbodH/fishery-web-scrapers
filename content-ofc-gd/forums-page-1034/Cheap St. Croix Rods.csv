199769,BFSC Kevin,2008-05-11 03:01:00,1351,REALLY?!??! my girlfriend lives just right there!! i gotta go check it out tomorrow!
199797,jace,2008-05-11 04:19:00,472,"Is it an authorized dealer?  I thought StCroix sold under the fixed price strategy.  If it's not authorized dealer, you might have problems getting any kind of warranty service through them.   That's the problem with buying a lot of things from ebay, sure they're the real items, but 1/2 the price on premium products is for the warranty and most items are not covered when bought from unauthorized dealers like  ebay retailers."
199800,Eason,2008-05-11 04:51:00,5, i asked the owner how come the price is so cheap..they said coz they're grand opening so st. croix allow them to have 10% off..but only last 2 weeks tho..i think they're authorized dealer
199810,jace,2008-05-11 06:43:00,472,"great!   that's a good find then.   Which model avid did you get?   I have a few of them myself, mostly the longer 8.5/9' salmon/steelhead rods.  I suppose they aren't the same since mine are all the older, pre ""IPC technology"", flat gray colored avids."
199811,Eason,2008-05-11 07:02:00,5, I got a 6'9..6-10lb for the walleye season..the new IPC tech is great..it's lighter & more sensitive then b4..
