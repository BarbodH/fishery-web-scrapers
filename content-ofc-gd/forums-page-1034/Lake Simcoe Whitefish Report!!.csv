It went from calm like below my wife Janice captured at about 7am at the dock @ Sibbalds to about 3 foot chop from the east by 930am.     In that time, we hooked into numerous Lake Simcoe Whitefish using Silver & Blue Willaims Whitefish and the ""mean green Meegs"" jigged in 66 FOW . The fish wanted it hovering about 6 inches above bottom and we played video games on the sonar tempting them to hammer the lure.  Theres a good fish fry in our future.....but moms getting a fillet gift wrapped later also.    "
