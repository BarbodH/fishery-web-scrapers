200404,bushart,2008-05-12 12:16:00,2628,Hey Guys/Gals  I moved to zone 15 from NW Ontario recently and I have a quick question---Tomorrow the wife and I are gonna go after lakers but I believe there's crappies in this lake.  Any tips on where and how deep to look this time of year? also bait choices?  Also I see there's a walleye slot now---used to that  Thanks
200412,Stoty,2008-05-12 12:30:00,2910,"The crappie should still be relatively shallow right now. Look for them in the 5-10 ft range around weedbeds.  Micro tubes, grubs spinners, and crankbaits are a must have. If you find schools of crappie/perch, try turing your boat around 180 degrees and throwing crankbaits and grubs for walleyes. They shouldnt be too far behind."
200415,Sinker,2008-05-12 12:31:00,8692," I like 2"" grubs, FIN-S minnows/shads, and 2""tubes under a float.  Look for shallow bays, in full sun. They are looking for the warmest water around. Shallow bays with a dark bottom seem to produce best for me, as do marinas and docks. Usually, if they are there, you'll catch them.  Good luck! Sinker"
