199743,charlied,2008-05-11 02:04:00,584,Being a former top canadian track and field athlete I hate to see Canadian Athletes treated unfairly.  This goes on way to much.  My girlfriend owns a Gymnastics club so I know what it takes to be a gymnast and to be the number 1 all around gymnast in Canada and not be selected to the Olympic team is crazy and makes me very sick to my stomach.   Please help this young Athlete out guys.  Thanks!  http://www.petitiononline.com/canwag/petition.html

200298,John Bacon,2008-05-12 02:46:00,3277,What is the reason that she was left off of the Olympic team?  I apologize if it was stated on link but I didn't see it.  It is something that I would want to know before signing the petition.
