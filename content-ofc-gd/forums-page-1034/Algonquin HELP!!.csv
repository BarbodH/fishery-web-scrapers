I have never fished trout mostly pike and walleye. I will be on Rock lake due to being on a school trip so we cant go to far into the interior. Anyways was wondering if any of my bass, pike and walleye gear will work. Are there Pike and Walleye or all trout?  Any help would be awsome  Thanks"

What i suggest to use is heavy spinners, so they go deeper trout cuz they like colder water. Run the ridges and structures. Also use alot of perch coloured lures...im going to be using Husyky jerks cuz they go deep. Ill also be jigging around deep rock structures with white and chartreuse twister tales. IF you are going to be canoeing, you can put some weights on the line and troll...that should be a success. Hope ive helped. Take some pictures if you can... beware of Blackflies cuz they are hatching! All the best! Pachone"

I fish trout all the time, and we only caught rock bass. Just to tell you the best place to fish is the weeds of rock lake, this is what it looks like    "
