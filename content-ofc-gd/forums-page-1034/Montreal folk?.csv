The Hoser-Frog in the vid and I may look similar because we wear glasses... but I don't own a ""Kenora Dinner Jacket""... maybe I could borrow yours sometime???   ... btw... I had to watch the vid aboot a dozen times to understand aboot half of what he was saying, that ""Paris Talk"" plum evades me!!!"
