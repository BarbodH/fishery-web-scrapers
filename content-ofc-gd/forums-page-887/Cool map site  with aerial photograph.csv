So you can see how your house looks from different aerial views.

313622,Cast-Away,2009-03-05 19:16:00,790,Thanks for the site. The images are more up to date than Google Maps.
313662,lookinforwalleye,2009-03-05 21:08:00,4399,  My son`s old red car is still in the drive way and it been gone for a year and a half!!
313664,Joey,2009-03-05 21:10:00,9122,"Very cool, thanks for that link.  Joey"
313697,kickingfrog,2009-03-05 22:11:00,8333,"As my brother said when I first told him about goggle maps, satellite shots and that you could see cars parked in drive-ways: ""Adulterers beware""."
313709,irishfield,2009-03-05 22:31:00,26272,"Yep.. and the detail gets better and better.  Anyone that wants to hit the back country of Simcoe County may wanna hit this map, that my son has been doing lots of work on as IT Coordinator for Tay Township. It has detail that is absolutely amazing.. because it's done from aerial photography at low level.. not satelitte. Bad part about it... township uses it to see what you've changed in your yard !!!!  http://maps.simcoe.ca/"

313790,Cast-Away,2009-03-06 01:26:00,790,"Wayne, check out the shoals on that PM that I sent you using this site!"
313793,Bernie,2009-03-06 01:38:00,3190,Way cool. This is the first one I have seen that shows my boathouse- in good detail too. Can't see the cottage for trees.
