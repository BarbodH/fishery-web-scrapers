313806,Fang,2009-03-06 01:50:00,1330,"It's me again  #1 Extreme Reel Fan  A few years back I picked up my first Extreme. I now have 6 and use these for all type of fishing especially flipping and pitchin for bass. Fished side be side with a Curado 200 I have. The Curados a better reel but for $69 I don't think you can buy a better bait caster. Cast spinnerbaits like a dream.  I'll use the same reel pitchin 50lb braid for largemouth and then respool 10lb and fish topwater smallies.  I really like them and they've never let me down.  I bought a 200 sized last spring and it took all the abuse in Northern Manitoba catching 40"" + pike and big lakers"
