I do not download all that much from Torrents, and when I do, its mainly TV shows I have missed.  The main site I use, the first thing you see when you enter the site is ...""UNLESS YOU LIVE IN CANADA, DOWNLOADING TORRENTS MAY BE ILLEGAL....""    I have always thought that there is nothing under Canadian law that makes downloading a movie illegal.   Maybe I am just naive."
314047,Raf,2009-03-06 17:24:00,3495," fair enough.. however, how long have cassettes been around? the industry did not crumble!!  people continued to make record profits.  chriss' example of radiohead doing their thing is a great example of artists getting with the times!  i believe david bowie and prince did similar things or gave their music away for free.   get your stuff out there and the people will come."

314006,Bitsmith2k,2009-03-06 16:08:00,396," you can legally make copies of them for your own use.. as rick said earlier, you're levied on all your recordable media and  recording devices.. that actually makes it legal to duplicate for personal use..  i'm pretty sure it was illegal to do back in the tape deck days.. the problem wasn't that big of a deal because people weren't digitally recording and mass distributing via the internet back then..  the book analogy doesnt work.. to make it work you'd have to think of it along the lines of photocopying each page and giving that to your friends.. the way i understand it you can give your old books away..  either way downloading copywrited material is wrong.. i dont go to the car dealership and just take a car because they're overpriced..  when my wife or someone asks me what software package to download in order to get music, i tell them iTunes.. you pay a buck a song (or whatever it is) and its yours, legal, and you dont have to worry about inadvertantly downloading something bad...  and in my experience playing the guitar is considerably more difficult than writing a computer program.."

314024,fish_finder,2009-03-06 16:36:00,370,"WOW!!!!  Jeez, does anyone really have any idea about copyright laws in Canada??????  Clearly not!  I've been involved in writing, recording and performing music for about 15 years.  I'm also a film maker.  With that said, I've done my fair share of research into copyright law, and being Canadian, particularly Canadian copyright law.  Laws in Canada are NOT what they are in the states or other countries for that matter.   The DMCA laws that the states put in place have all but destroyed rights that any user has.  Those big record companies......lets just say they aren't too pleased with the laws.  Chris in particular, have a look at this book:  http://www.amazon.ca/Canadian-Copyright-Ci...y/dp/1897071302  I'd also urge others to pick one up.....your library should have one.  After all, Canadian copyright - users rights, is what allows us to obtain materials free from libraries.....and that includes music and movies.  I see no use in owning the book unless you are creating and copywriting works for distribution.  The book has been very useful for me.  Its a great book for any artist, performer, author, musician..........you name it!  dave"
314025,danbouck,2009-03-06 16:39:00,4380, I disagree 100%
314027,Raf,2009-03-06 16:43:00,3495,sink or swim  its clear the 'old way' of doing things is no longer viable.  some artists have discovered they dont need a label and can produce a quality product and distribute it on the net for free.  others continue to bend over for the 'man' (rec exec) and are whining.  you aren't going to stop people from downloading music on the net.  it's a new frontier for the brave..
314028,fish_finder,2009-03-06 16:46:00,370," Precisely Raf!  Anyone even considering trying to make a buck from selling CD's is nuts!!!  100% nuts!  Money in the music industry is made from those massive stadium shows......you know, like 300$ a ticket to see U2 or something like that.  CD's, sorry, but in my experience, yes, I've had music distributed on 'Labels' and there ain't even enough money made to buy a big mac......"
314029,Bitsmith2k,2009-03-06 16:49:00,396, hah.. i've got lots of dev. buddies that do both extremely well.. i just dont have a musical bone in my body..
314031,Chris,2009-03-06 16:51:00,405, I am well versed in Canadian copyright laws. What have I said that makes you think I need to read the book.
314032,Chris,2009-03-06 16:52:00,405, You are 100% correct and you also make my point very well. You can't make money selling something that people steal.
314033,Chris,2009-03-06 16:54:00,405,"Dan Bouck  But you do get paid for writing that computer program, right?"
314035,Danubian,2009-03-06 16:54:00,65," I guess, the epitome of this heated thread would be reached when someone will download an illicit copy of the Canadian Copyright book. HAAAHAA!"
314036,Raf,2009-03-06 16:57:00,3495, Artists *never* made any significant money from selling cds/vinyl.  Majority of their income comes from touring and merchandise sales.  Rec. companies on the other hand... we can do without them.
314037,Danubian,2009-03-06 17:00:00,65," But of course, my brave paddawan... Particularly when one writes cracking software, it pays a lot, but it's rather satisfaction than money. And all the GPL and Open Source software, what would you say about that?"
314038,Stoty,2009-03-06 17:02:00,2910," Not necessarily! I've written a lot of them that I haven't been paid for.  But like people have said, things are different now. The internet is the way of the world, and people need to adapt to it, in order to be successful."
314040,Chris,2009-03-06 17:10:00,405," Wrong!!!!  Artists do make more money touring, but they can also make a pile selling cd's (the key word being ""selling"") My nephew Dane Mills was one of the original members of The Arcade Fire (over 1,000,000 records sold) and he made 60K just on their 7-song EP that they recorded themselves in a barn. Once people bought their full cd they went on their website and bought up all their EP's. I think they made at least two extra runs of 15,000 and 10,000 copies.  Raf they did this without a major behind them. They went indie with Merge Records out of North Carolina. Two weeks before they recorded their debut album, Funeral, they drove from Montreal to Brockville to play a show for $50 in front of 100 people.  Also what about Radiohead. They recorded their last cd themselves and put it on the internet and said you pay what you want. In the first month they sold a million copies for an average price of $8 per cd. That would take a headliner like Avril Levigne (who is at the top of the payscale) about 4 concerts to make a million. But how many shows would Avril be playing and how many free downloads would there be if people had not bought her cd first? It's all inter-related.  If you think stealing is OK just because YOU feel it is part of some brave new world, go ahead and teach your kids just that. Don't complain if someone steals your fishing tackle tho'."
314041,bigfish1965,2009-03-06 17:11:00,3382," The internet is a two sided coin, Chris. Many bands would not exist today if not for the internet. I own coprighted material too..lots of it, including a piece of this site. Does it get ripped off? All the time. Is there anything I can do? Not alot. There are bands I have bought CD's from after downloading a few of their songs. They would have NEVER slod me anything had I not d/l a song of theirs first. Musicians are doing quite well and up and coming bands had trouble geting signed long before the internet. That 19 yr old rap star who just got busted for beating his girlfriend did it in his LAMBOURGHINI Many artisits openly promote people downloading music. They know it is their best chance of getting noticed. I have attended several concerts of the band I mentioned earlier as far away as Florida. So my money spent on music has indeed tripled at least because of downloading. Part of the issue is I cannot go into a music store anymore and get what I want. If I want to replace my original Boston album...good luck. Downloading things like Photoshop etc is not costing Adobe much, if anything, because at $1000 a copy, it is not being downloaded by anyone who would have bought it in the first place. Now, how many guitar tabs have you looked up online, chris? Thats illegal too. Every musician I know does it. And is it harder to play guitar or program...its a toss up. Music remains made of the same chords, but computer languages change all the time. At the end of it all, no one has been convicted of it..it is not illegal, it is a violation of your user agreement and is a civil matter, not a criminal one. It is not theft because all people have done is rearrange binaries in their computer memory. But going into a store and lifting an actual CD is illegal and criminal. They took and tangible item. It is similar to the picture of an out of season fish, not really illegal, maybe, well no one has been busted for it, so no one can say yes."
314044,Headhunter,2009-03-06 17:16:00,5703,"Sorry, I have to disagree Raf... Artist's made great money off of record sales historically, that is until audio cassettes became popular, only to be replaced by file sharing. Not all artists, mind you, the successful one's.  What I find most shocking here is two things...  1. people are defending their right to steal. 2. people responding to the thread changing peoples names, ie Chrissy!  Who do you think you are , Joe Bowen? You may not agree with Chris or others opposed to YOUR point of view, but historically, we here have not lowered ourselves to calling each other names... it's about respect man... show some decorum!

313816,Danubian,2009-03-06 02:08:00,65,"From the second e-mail published here:  Because of privacy concerns, we cannot give any  information regarding the plaintiff, as we do not provide any  information to the plaintiff about you except if ordered by a court of  law. If you want to know who the plaintiff is, you can search on the  internet who is the copyright owner of the material referenced in the  complaint.  My understanding is that: 1) There is a plaintiff which filed a complaint against/at the ISP 2) The ISP is keeping a traffic log - obviously...- that could be used in an investigation if ordered by a court of law  I think that the simplest scenario of this story is where the ""plaintiff"" - i.e. Adobe Corp - planted the file as a bait, then it recorded all the accesses and in the end, it sent mass complaint e-mails to the originating ISPs, most probably only to those ISPs which are under US, Canadian or EU jurisdiction.  Pursuing someone in justice for such a minor thing as in downloading PhotoShop, or ""In Bruges"", is rather a joke. Their legal costs would be huge and the ""return of investment"" uncertain. How do they decide to sue Joe Millionaire and not Ricky Burgerflipper? Do they hire an investigator first? Or maybe they sue both guys, and if so, for how much in punitive damages?...  I am not saying ""keep downloading from torrents"", but you got my point. And yes, if you can find a proxy, preferably from a country that cannot be summoned in a US or Canadian court, the sooner the better.

313829,bigfish1965,2009-03-06 02:20:00,3382,"The legality in Canada is very ambiguous. If I loan my purchased DVD to you, I am technically also breaking the law. Our courts recognized that this was impossible to monitor. There is a special fee we pay on all blank Cd's and DVD's which goes to a fund and is distributed to recording/movie studios...sort of a buy off so we don't have to deal with the whole privacy thing. Getting a conviction here is dam near impossible which is why we don't see the stuff like you see in the US with the RIAA. I have no idea what I am really downloading until it is done. It could be Stairway to Heaven, it could be some guys dog barking for an hour. No one monitoring my usage knows what I am getting either. The act of ripping a CD I bought and putting it on my iPod is also illegal..but also unenforceable and no court in the land wants to touch it and since the recording companies already lost here once when the court ruled the ISP could not provide information to the plaintiff, they do not want to go to court and lose and blow the whole thing wide open."
313925,Chris,2009-03-06 11:27:00,405,"As the owner of copyrighted material that is for sale I have one comment for those who steal copyrighted material. You are thieves plain and simple. No better than someone who breaks into your home and steals your stuff. Chances are you won't get charged, but your only hurting yourselves. I see people on this message board complainging about the bailouts and white collar crimes that go unpunished. I see people on here just about jump out of their pants if someone trolls two lines or even keeps a legal fish. Yet when it comes to stealing something it's OK with you.  Picture it from this perspective. You pay hard earned cash to buy a guitar and then spend money to take lessons and then hone your craft for years and years until you can play. Then you join a band and you work your ass off to rehearse enough songs to play live. Then you play live for several years to get good at it (that is if some DJ playing someone else's music hasn't eliminated the live venue). Then you spend all the money you made gigging for the last 5 years to record your own original music. Then you pay to have it mastered, then your pay again to have it reproduced. Then you pay to advertise, promote and distribute your cd. You sell some (never making your money back) and then all of a sudden it's on the internet and some shmuck is downloading it for free.  Let's look at another perspective. After all the Bull in the first part of the last paragraph, you get recognized by a major label (BTW there are only 3 major labels left and they will fold soon as well) and they have you come in to record your songs for a cd. They front you 250K to record and another 250K in tour support. If you have a previous successful cd you would probably get more, including cash to pay for a reknowned producer. The band then sells a million records (not likely with all the thieves out there). But the record company only pays the band about 10% of the earnings (that's how record deals work). But first, out of that 10% the band must pay back the record company all that money that was fronted to them in the first place. In most cases bands do not see a profit until their third or even fourth million selling cd. Most of the rich and famous bands you see are not rich at all (unless you're a mega-star). It's all image and not like was in the sixties or seventies.  Less than 10% of bands recorded by a major label will sell more than 10,000 copies of their cd. Meaning they will fold. A famous musician wasv recently quoted saying ""There used to be a hundred bands out there each selling a million cds. Now there are a million bands out there selling a hundred cds.""  Knock yourselves out guys and keep stealing. Eventually all the good musicians will give it up. Many have already. Joni Mitchell, one of North America's greatest songwriters can't get a record deal because there's no room for her beside Brittany, Christina and Avril, who all sell regurgitated crap."
313958,Headhunter,2009-03-06 13:56:00,5703,"Well put Chris S! I have to admitt to down loading musci files, but I will also say that all of the music I have down loeaded, I have on vinyl.

I have never down loaded a movie, no interest...but I can most certain appreciate what you have said, and whole heartedly agree. HH"
313964,chukkk,2009-03-06 14:15:00,57," I  love how musicians or musician wannabees always have an excuse as to why someone doesn't  run out and buy there  original music especially in Canada. The 'original"" music usually is crap that is why the masses don't storm tyour door. Generally when you have to pay to make your own CD  there is a message there . Joni Mitchel is old news and I can see why she doesnt compete with the Brittany Spears , Rhianna crowd.  So please if you want to be a musician and  famous go to American Idol and audition, that will seperate the men from the boys."
313977,Zebco,2009-03-06 15:00:00,123,"That Chris guys is so famous nobody knows who he is, must be the internets fault.

313978,Danubian,2009-03-06 15:05:00,65," Chris, Your efforts to learn playing the guitar are very pale compared to the efforts of a guy that learned to program a computer. Then, it comes into play your musical genius VS his technical genius (to create ripping tools, protection crackers, P2P software and so on). So far you're at par...  But anyway, I'd say that both of you do what you do out of dedication, professional vocation and [why not?] an amount of sacrifice.  If you're worth anything whatsoever, you'll surface anyway.

Ill be thinking about you guys this year when I troll for muskies with two rods out. Maybe keep a couple dozen bass for the freezer and throw some garbage around just for good measure.   Haha, Chuckles, that comment speaks volumes about your musical tastes, besides I think only two of America's Idols have gone on to bigger better things.

281330,Roy,2008-12-19 00:54:00,13728,I would take it seriously.
281339,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-19 01:13:00,10439,"Of course it's illegal to share files using P2P software such as Bit Torrent. Your ISP is using software to gather info on P2P protocol transfers on their network. All the info gathered will be stored in a database incase there are lawsuits filed as there were in the Napster suits. The info can be used to charge and or sue you for theft of intellectual property. Now you are informed, download at your own risk!!!"
281342,fishing n autograph,2008-12-19 01:15:00,2540,Means nothing....a few buddies of mine are employees at Rogers and it's a scare tactic
281344,irishfield,2008-12-19 01:16:00,26272,Internet provider is trying to cut your bandwidth usage !
281360,Terry,2008-12-19 01:46:00,14456,I thought in canada they said downloading copyrighted stuff still is legal uploading the same may be illegal in canada that is why maybe you shouldn't use Bit Torrent they upload the same time they download do it the old fashion way..get it off off file share sites
281361,Gerritt,2008-12-19 01:46:00,6129,I have one word for you regarding this.... Proxies... find out what they are and use them.  class dismissed.  G
281364,darsky,2008-12-19 01:52:00,586,  I thought about that until I realized I get billed a flat $25.00 when I go over.
281365,Beats,2008-12-19 01:52:00,543,"The thing with torrents, especially private trackers is that in order to be a member you must seed (share) back whatever you download.  So a 4 gig DVDR becomes closer to 8 gigs once seeded back.  So internet providers have caught on and are trying to throttle torrent traffic to try and turn ppl away from torrents.  I have no idea why you would have thought it was legal to share copyrighted material.  While nothing pops up to prevent you from downloading anything, it doesn't mean its legal.  Like anything in life, when  laws are in place but not enforced it doesn't take long for ppl to assume its ok and believe they won't get dealt with.  I use private trackers myself and get incredibly high speeds and don't have to worry (as much) about security as with public trackers or low level private sites like Demonoid.  ISP's like Rogers have, in recent months, installed bandwidth caps (60 gigs) to try and fight torrents and their high use of bandwidth.  Adding a $/gig charge for additional use is how it works now."

281370,DRIFTER_016,2008-12-19 01:58:00,10439,  There are other ways of dealing with high bandwidth traffic. I used to run a small ISP and would limit the available bandwidth on a protocol basis and used QOS (Quality of Service) to reserve bandwitdh for time/bandwidth sensitive protocols such as VOIP and Streaming Media.
281372,highdrifter,2008-12-19 02:00:00,2534,"Wow.  Sounds like you're under their radar...  Even if it's a scare tactic, I'd take the warning seriously.  Ever try using Scrapetorrent and Vuse?  Used them for years and never had a problem..  I'd look into this a little bit further though.  Looks like they're monitoring your IP!!  cheers HD"
281373,irishfield,2008-12-19 02:02:00,26272,"HD.. wait until they send his better half a list of all the other ""sites"" he's been watching videos on !"
281384,modny,2008-12-19 02:23:00,502,just make sure u dont seed back
281385,ch312,2008-12-19 02:26:00,1590,ive been downloading everything from music up to hardcore software for at least 7 years and i have received ONE email from rogers. they actually turned off the internet for 1 week. i ended up getting credit on the account because of that...  and the reason they suspended my internet? i downloaded a no-cd patch for a game my buddy gave me. odd how i get a warning from a legal game but not the other ones i downloaded
281390,Beats,2008-12-19 02:29:00,543,  If you understood the whole idea of the torrent system you would know that doesn't work too well.  The idea is to create a system where ppl share files instead of just taking them.  Users who share back at a good rate have exceptionally better download speeds than those who try and limit their uploads.  If all you want is to download and not have to share back then perhaps you should get into newsgroups.
281398,darsky,2008-12-19 02:46:00,586,  ...she knows em all.Heck-when things are good we watch em together. And HD I have been using Vuze / Azureus for years and I received this. Actually I got TWO emails. One was for Transporter 3 the other was for W.
281406,PatrickGG,2008-12-19 03:04:00,562,"Firewall your P.C and i Don't know if your hooked up to a router? they do have there own Firewalls that prevents hackers from accessing your P.C, and Routers always assign the same IP address to a host based on its MAC address, the only thing is your gonna have to learn how to assign ports to specific programs to access the internet."
281412,BillM,2008-12-19 03:11:00,17367,I'd add this to the junk folder.
281421,Raf,2008-12-19 03:19:00,3495,have a look at a piece of software called peer guardian
281423,highdrifter,2008-12-19 03:23:00,2534," Ah c'mon.. no bits here, just good ol streaming video.  A new day brings a whole new whack of fine adult entertainment!!  "
281447,Stoty,2008-12-19 03:53:00,2910,Can't say I'd be giving out my IP address though! Especially with the latest IE security breach!  Might wanna edit that out with some xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
281520,Paulus,2008-12-19 13:56:00,522,"I wouldn't sweat it. I've received two of these notices myself over the past year. Guantanamo Bay might be considered an upgrade over the Shwa - especially tonight with all the snow that's coming... First off, it's not that it's legal to share, but it is not illegal to make or obtain a copy. Bla bla over whether torrent downloading is sharing or copying. Who cares. Secondly, whatever file that that notice identifies should be removed from the list of files you're sharing. They're not sending you the notice over your acquisition of it, rather they are telling you that you're not allowed to distribute it to others (..for money, which they can't prove but which is definitely illegal in Canada). Finally, cycle the material that you have available on your HD for sharing with others. This means that you still get good download speeds, while avoiding this kind of crap. I limit my uploads per session to 10 files. BTW the IP that they identify in the mail piece resides at the ISP, not on your computer, your router or your firewall.  p.-"
281535,ch312,2008-12-19 14:30:00,1590, it makes no difference at all if you post it online or not as anyone with the intent of attacking your computer can have your IP address in the blink of an eye.  hackers are always a step ahead...
