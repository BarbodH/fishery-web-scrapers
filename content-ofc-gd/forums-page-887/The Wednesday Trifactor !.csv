313439,Jigger,2009-03-05 04:31:00,1237,"Irishfield, you have by far the coolest ""I wonder what I should do today?"" option going. And who could complain about the fuel costs? Awesome!  I want to build one too."
313456,OhioFisherman,2009-03-05 08:27:00,6623,"If I had to get into a plane to fish I might have became a hunter. Great report though Wayne, airplanes look cool, my favorite is the P-51D, to look at.  That lake herring? Is that the same as a Moon Eye? Got something that looked like that from a bait store up there when I bought bait. Didn`t know what it was and told the guy I didn`t want it because I didn`t know if it was legal as bait."
313459,Terry,2009-03-05 10:34:00,14456,lake herring = cisco
313473,motv8tr,2009-03-05 12:06:00,2587,"Grerat stuff Wayne, that's a heck of a way to spend a day...  Maureen"
313478,LeXXington,2009-03-05 12:29:00,1928,That would almost make me actaully enjoy Ice fishing.  Great pics Wayne.
313479,b2kptbo,2009-03-05 12:31:00,1505,"Wow talk about changing spots, that's the way to do it, good one..."

313493,corvette1,2009-03-05 13:09:00,1765,congrats wayne the only way to travel much safer than the 401
313494,ehg,2009-03-05 13:12:00,2666,Was going to post the same comment about 'run and gun'. Maybe there should be a float plane ice fishing tourney!
313495,TroutnMuskieHunter,2009-03-05 13:18:00,1362,Great report Wayne....
313512,Headhunter,2009-03-05 13:47:00,5703,"Ok... so let me get this straight... you had this means of transportation the whole time, but left it at home, then we travel over one hundred miles on snow machines to get to a lake you then tell me you can land and take off from and are looking forward to the 8 minute ride from the cottage... so now you post this report adding salt to the wound... in hindsight... I'd have done the same thing! LOL Nice Wayne... thanks for posting! HH"
313533,irishfield,2009-03-05 15:04:00,26272," Crips Joe... by the time your Grandkids come along you'll be telling the story that we went 400 miles each way by dog sled, two days in a row, just to fish for Brookies! lol"

313570,Jds63,2009-03-05 16:32:00,1365,"That is an amazing lifestyle, and talented to say the least."
313337,irishfield,2009-03-05 01:57:00,26272,"So with OFC down for a day + I got so much work done in the shop that the boss gave me a day off.  Sunshine, not too cold.. a bit of a breeze and the solution of what to do with the day didn't take long to figure out.  Somehow I've been hooked onto this dumb sport called ice fishing and it didn't take me long to get my vehicle loaded up!    Moments later I was saying goodbye to Penetang around 10:45 am..... and hello to the gorgeous view of Georgian Bay    Port Severn outflow is starting to work it's magic on the ice.    Only 14 minutes later I was settled in and fishing Matchedash Lake !    Didn't mark a darn thing for about an hour... so I moved up the lake a bit.    Didn't mark anything there either... so I gave it 30 minutes and then packed up and decided where to go next.  Outflow from Six Mile Lake into the pool.    Heck.. why not fish Six Mile....    Gave it a quick circle looking for structure and open current areas ....and a total of 12 minutes after leaving Matchedash I was marking a school of fish!    Trying to get them to cooperate    ..and wouldn't you now !    Played with them for about an hour... hoping something big would come along, but nope... so packed up and headed back towards home.    You take the long way... I'll take the high way..    Then I decided to make it a triple play. Why not fish Georgian Bay.    Gave it some thought... checked out the current areas and then picked a spot out by Governors Island.    So 10 minutes after leaving Six Mile Lake I was set up and jigging way out on Georgian Bay! Was marking some stuff on bottom in 68FOW that wasn't cooperating.. wandered around a bit and then came back just in time to see something just going off the screen that was marked about 30 feet down. Brought my spoons up and it came back. Took a bit of coaxing but it hit hard. Peeled dragged.. thinking I had a nice pickeral coming up I was surprised by my first ever Lake Herring.. and a nice one at that. And you wonder how them Muskie's get big! lol    The auger makes a great camera holder !    Sun is getting low... time to go..      Headin towards home    7 minutes later I was home in the yard at 4:55pm!  Now the only question is... why'd I wait this long to get hooked on ice fishing. Total travel time to do 3 lakes and get home 43 minutes. Total fuel burn.. 4 US gallons = 15 litres !"
313343,Bernie,2009-03-05 02:11:00,3190,Wow Wayne thats friggen incredible. I wanna hang out with you for a day like that.
313344,Leecher,2009-03-05 02:12:00,7832,Great report and pics Wayne  Got to love it when you get time on your hands.... and what better way then spending it flying into 3 different lakes for a shot at hard water fishing  That herring is a fine looking one      congratulations Thanks for sharing your fly-in adventure Leechman
313345,Paully,2009-03-05 02:13:00,712,Thats awsome!   :worthy:  You sure cant go wrong doing it that way!
313351,irishfield,2009-03-05 02:18:00,26272, Well you can... if you notice in the first picture of the airplane the skis are down. Don't do that on glare polished ice. I weather cocked and was blown straight to shore from the middle of the lake before I could get the engine shut down.. door open and jump out hanging onto the wing strut to get it to stop going like a curling rock before I hit shore! Note all the other shots are wheels down!
313354,Sinker,2009-03-05 02:19:00,8692,Now thats the way to travel!!! Friggen awesome!  Sinker

313364,Terry,2009-03-05 02:30:00,14456,"I think they would know , what I did  and we have an agreement about only so many people off at one time....  if I called in sick after asking those days off...people would be POed....AND THEY HAVE BEEN GOOD TO ME  I am thinking it's too far to go just for Sat. and Sun"

313368,the spirit of fishing,2009-03-05 02:37:00,141,Great report-really love the aerial shots. I'm not familiar with that area but it sure sounds like an efficient way to cover 43 minutes of travel time!

313374,Cast-Away,2009-03-05 02:50:00,790,"Wayne, you are the luckiest bum alive! I am extremely jealous. I love trying to figure out the land forms without reading the captions like the shot of Present and Beuseile Island, then Giants Tomb later on. I sent you a PM with a summer time hotspot."
313376,solopaddler,2009-03-05 02:55:00,8605," Yep I hear ya. Flying your own plane is after all the sport for the masses, heck everybody's doing it these days LOL!  Y'know I'm gonna get right on that tomorrow, see if maybe I can Red Green something together in the backyard. (They don't call duct tape 100mph tape fer nuthin'!  )"
313378,irishfield,2009-03-05 02:59:00,26272,"LOL Mike... I've got lots of aluminum if you wanna do it the right way. I built everything in that airplane except the wheels/tires, propellor and panel instruments"
