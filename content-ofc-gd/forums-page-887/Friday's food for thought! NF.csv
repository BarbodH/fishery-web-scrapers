Then using God's bountiful gifts, Satan created Dairy Ice Cream and  Magnums. And Satan said, 'You want hot fudge with that? And Man said,  'Yes!' And Woman said, 'I'll have one too with chocolate chips'. And lo  they gained 10 pounds.  And God created the healthy yoghurt that woman might keep the figure that  man found so fair.    And Satan brought forth white flour from the wheat and sugar from the cane  and combined them. And Woman went from size 12 to size 14.    So God said, 'Try my fresh green salad'. And Satan presented Blue Cheese  dressing and garlic croutons on the side. And Man and Woman unfastened  their belts following the repast.    God then said 'I have sent you healthy vegetables and olive oil in which to  cook them'..    And Satan brought forth deep fried coconut king prawns, butter-dipped  lobster chunks and chicken fried steak, so big it needed its own platter,  and Man's cholesterol went through the roof.    Then God brought forth the potato; naturally low in fat and brimming with  potassium and good nutrition.    Then Satan peeled off the healthy skin and sliced the starchy centre into  chips and deep-fried them in animal fats adding copious quantities of salt.  And Man put on more pounds. God then brought forth running shoes so that  his Children might lose those extra pounds.    And Satan came forth with a cable TV with remote control so Man would not  have to toil changing the channels. And Man and Woman laughed and cried  before the flickering light and started wearing stretch jogging suits.    Then God gave lean beef so that Man might consume fewer calories and still  satisfy his appetite.    And Satan created McDonalds and the $2 double cheeseburger. Then Satan said  'You want fries with that?' and Man replied, 'Yes, and super size 'em'. And  Satan said, 'It is good.' And Man and Woman went into cardiac arrest.    God sighed ......... And created quadruple by-pass surgery.    And then ............ Satan chuckled and created the National Health  Service.    THE FINAL WORD ON NUTRITION    After an exhaustive review of the research literature, here's the final  word on nutrition and health.:    1.   Japanese eat very little fat and suffer fewer heart attacks than us.  2.   Mexicans eat a lot of fat and suffer fewer heart attacks than us.  3.   Chinese drink very little red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks than  us.  4.   Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine and suffer fewer heart  attacks than us.  5.   Germans drink beer and eat lots of sausages and fats and suffer fewer  heart attacks than us.  6.   The French eat foie-Gras, full fat cheese and drink red wine and  suffer fewer heart attacks than us    CONCLUSION: Eat and drink what you like.  Speaking English is apparently  what kills you.  HH"
