313125,Dan668,2009-03-04 17:33:00,1120,"Adding another reel / rod to my collection  Have a 6'8 MH Cumura / Daiwa Alpha F 6'6 MH Xtreme bps rod / Shimano Curado B  Was looking for a burner reel such as a revo or zillion or new curado.  Any recommendations, torn on what to get.  thanks"
313131,salmon,2009-03-04 17:53:00,334," Steez 103SHA if price in no object. I have the 103HA best reels on the market, better than my Calais The Curado are also nice I have the E5   Jose"
313165,Dan668,2009-03-04 19:32:00,1120,Money isn't an issue. But I could get a good reel and rod for that price. Both my reels have a slower rate of retrieve so I want a quicker ratio. Fish for pike bass and walleye.
313170,Dan668,2009-03-04 19:38:00,1120,Could always get a m action rod and switch the reels around Lol. I don't really follow a rod for specific techniques.  As long as I have a rod ready without having to retie every lure.
313176,salmon,2009-03-04 19:44:00,334,Look at these options  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewshimanochr...chdpreview.html  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewquantum2009reelspre.html  http://www.tackletour.com/reviewcuradociticapreview09.html  Jose
313188,Dan668,2009-03-04 20:15:00,1120,Want to stay away from quantum. havent had much luck with them in the past I do however prefer magnetic brake. easier to change. although i can cast with either methods no problem. Any rod recommendations. Stuck with shimano before because of their warranty.
313385,EC1,2009-03-05 03:08:00,930,"I've read good reviews of this on another site --> the Daiwa Zillion. Price is considerably lower than the Steez, and has the fastest retrieve ratio out there.  7.3 : 1  I'm not positive to how much it costs in CDN, but good luck in choosing your reels!  Here's the link to the reel: http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/s...0001000_100-1-1"
313394,Cudz,2009-03-05 03:19:00,2652,If I had the choice right now I would like to give some of the new e21 rods a shot.  I would probably mate it with a new curado 200.
313438,Dan668,2009-03-05 04:29:00,1120,I do like the zillion. Would of bought japanese but the exchange rate  sucks now. Which e21. Looked at them before. There warranty any good in Canada
313442,Dan668,2009-03-05 04:36:00,1120,I read someplace that their guided aren't the greatest. I use braid most of the tome to.
313444,EC1,2009-03-05 04:43:00,930,"e21 is carrot stix. I am telling you from reading that people love the gold carrot stix, which is supposedly very light. Lifetime warranty, and their head office is in downtown Toronto, you probably should look into them."
313469,Cudz,2009-03-05 11:47:00,2652,"I hope they are guaranteed in Canada, it is a canadian company.  Keep the money in Canada. I was thinking of the gold carrot.  Supposed to be real nice"
313531,Dan668,2009-03-05 15:02:00,1120,Ha the gold one is sort of pricey. Have to order from the states to
313594,GoneFishin,2009-03-05 18:05:00,349, You can find them around Ontario. I was set on getting a carrot stix or two but after I handled one in Gagnons Sports I decided it wasn't for me. They seem like a fairly beefy rod although they are supposed to be really light and didn't seem very sensitive. I think I'm gonna go with the Premier or Mojo. I haven't had much experience with higher end rods though but it would probably be a good idea to handle one before buying off the internet.
313603,Dan668,2009-03-05 18:17:00,1120,Might go for a powell rod.maybe a heavier rod since one I use for cranks and spinners and the other is around.  Anyone order from tackle warehouse before.
313679,Dan668,2009-03-05 21:38:00,1120,flipping and pitching worthwhile techniques to learn? What species is it good for
313864,Cudz,2009-03-06 03:42:00,2652,"I have ordered from there before.  They have good service but be careful ordering rods from the states.  I have done so in the past and out of 4 rods, 2 have arrived broken despite the fragile stickers all over the tube. BPS has St Croix mojos for sale.  about $100 and they are pretty beefy."
