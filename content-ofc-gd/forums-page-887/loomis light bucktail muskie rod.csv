314286,tomkat,2009-03-07 03:21:00,246,Does anyone use the 7'9'' loomis light bucktail muskie rod? And if so what do you think? I just bought one on ebay and thought it might be a nice Kawartha rod.
314320,mikeh,2009-03-07 04:57:00,824,What are the specs on the rod?  I'd be happy to test it on the Kawartha's for ya
