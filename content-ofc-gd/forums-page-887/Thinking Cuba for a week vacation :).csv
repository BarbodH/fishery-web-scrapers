Ive never been to cuba and though id give it a try since they have great beachs and I heard decent DIY fishing... Last couple years ive been going to Jamaica, Cozumel, or dominican.  Has anyone been to any of these locations during that time of the year? how is the fishing on these small islands.  Im looking for something that I could fish near the resort or within a short drive away.. .Fishing from the beach would be ideal.  Any recommendations would be appreciated.   *** My gf is trying to get us to go in early may and im like "" You crazy ! I cant miss Walleye opener then pike opener then whitefish opener ! Ontario is prime in may !"

313626,cityfisher,2009-03-05 19:22:00,959, Thanks for the link ! Nice pics !  How was the beach? My GF loves snorkeling and I heard Cayo COco sometimes gets hit with alot of wind makin snorkeling / swimming a pain.

Some one I know caught it in her eye and she had to stay there in hospitals for an extra week.  Her eye would have exploded if she flew in a plane, it was that swelled.  I have been to Cayo Coco 3 times and the water is awsome there for snorkeling and swimming"
