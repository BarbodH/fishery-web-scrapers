313741,Cookslav,2009-03-06 00:02:00,1457,"How quickly is the ice gonna go? Was hoping to get out on the ice this weekend but geeeeze....16 degrees tommorrow, with 11 on Saturday. I'm definatly no expert but I'm guessing its all down hill from here"
313743,Terry,2009-03-06 00:06:00,14456,rivers and edges can be affected but the lake no problem
313753,Leecher,2009-03-06 00:25:00,7832,I would not worry either.... might want to bring rubber boots and cleats tho.... could be a little wet on the surface Leechman
313794,kickingfrog,2009-03-06 01:39:00,8333,16 is warm but it's the rain (that's in the forecast as well) that will melt the ice faster. It couldn't wait 2 more weekends?
313799,Cookslav,2009-03-06 01:44:00,1457,"LOL...ya I'm a big Chicken I guess. There was an easy 18"" of ice last weekend, so I guess it should be fine minus the edge... There is Zero Current there so I'm guessing it'll be ok. Its just I've never ventured out there in that kind of weather..."
313807,Leecher,2009-03-06 01:52:00,7832," No worries.... go for it and enjoy your day out But like I said in my previous thread, bring some rubber boots and cleats cause it will be wet and slippery Leechman"
313813,Cookslav,2009-03-06 02:03:00,1457, Will do for sure thanks for the advice
313820,Bernie,2009-03-06 02:13:00,3190,Seeing the odd lightning flash to the north of me. Still at 0 right now but it's coming up.
313830,Leecher,2009-03-06 02:20:00,7832," Hey Bernie, it's -5 up here right now and the winds are from the east.... suppose to get 5-10cm of snow and then turning to freezing rain  Hoping to get out tomorrow for a little while if the weather holds"
313838,Bernie,2009-03-06 02:31:00,3190,Snow isn't as bad as freezing rain Jacques. We have been putting up with a sheet of ice everywhere since a quick melt a week ago.  It's been so cold that the sand just blows off it in the shade. A thaw will be welcomed here to get rid of it. I wanted to get my family out this weekend fishing but it will end up too wet and sloppy out there.
