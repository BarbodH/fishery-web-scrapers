After a couple of times failing, I finally catch my first!   Sorry for the really bad pic, I was stupid to have been fishing for pike 2m above the water with no net, it looks like a fingerling doesn't it? Thanks to one of the guys that were fishing there, he helped me release it without me having to swim with the pike! No closeups, But my guess would be that fish was ~20"" and weighed 3-4 pounds.  Casted for approx. 2 Hours, and it was well worth it. Glad to have also met another OFC'er - Anton! Thanks Anton, for giving me some tips and pointers about pike fishing. Sorry for making you stop at the gas station though, I really did fill up 83.3 for Premium gas at like 10 this morning at that gas station!"
