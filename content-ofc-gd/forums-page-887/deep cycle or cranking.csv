313938,sonny,2009-03-06 12:20:00,511,"Ok over the last couple of years my cranking battery has had some accesories added to it,,,sonar,lighting and downrigggers,,,the question is now that the battery need replacing would a deep cycle battery last longer under theses circumstances.  What are you running?"
313941,Greencoachdog,2009-03-06 12:35:00,8163,"I don't think so, you need the cranking battery for the cold craking amps for your motor. They don't last forever, but will be ok with all the stuff you mentioned."
313942,Whitespinnerbait,2009-03-06 12:39:00,2038,They do sell combo    deep cycle / cranking batteries ........
313944,sonny,2009-03-06 12:43:00,511,"  I was also wondering about these,,,and i forgot to mention alot of the time when operating the down riggers the main motor is off and trolling with a kicker that is not charging the battery."
313945,diggyj,2009-03-06 12:45:00,548,"My boat only has a fish finder, nav lights and live well so when I recently picked up a new battery I asked around and even the people at INTERSTATE Batteries told me to just go with the Deep Cycle Battery.   If you are running a bunch of other things like radio, trolling motor, etc then a cranking would be better."
313947,Billy Bob,2009-03-06 13:12:00,5865,"A deep cycle battery should be only used for the trolling motor and the main starting battery should be enough to handle GPS/Sonar combo, live well, VHF radio, bilge bump and running lights. I have a Delco Voyager for 8 years taking care of all of this while my deep cycle battery is only hooked up to the trolling motor. I also have a on-board charging system that is hook up to both batteries. This is plug in once I return home or at the dock that I am staying at.  DEEP CYCLE BATTERIES SHOULD NOT BE HOOKED UP THE THE OUTBOARD IF IT HAS A ALTERNATOR. THIS SMALL CHARGE IS NOT GOOD FOR THE DEEP CYCLE BATTERY.  Bob"
313950,ssminnow,2009-03-06 13:20:00,48,"I have the same situation as you (fishfinder, gps, 2 downriggers and use kicker).  I picked up one of the energizer deep/cycle batteries and have had no problems.  Probably not the best batteries but pretty cheap and the one I have in my 14' just used for lights and starting is going on 6 or 7 years."
