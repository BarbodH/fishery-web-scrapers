313875,TJQ,2009-03-06 04:06:00,7806,Yup!!  a pair a day for a while!!
313877,kickingfrog,2009-03-06 04:13:00,8333, Sounds good.  Tickets are $17 each for adults. You can save $2 per ticket online before Mar 9th. A man has to eat a lot of those sausage samples to make back $17 times 2!
313884,rbaquial,2009-03-06 04:26:00,968,"If you go to LeBaron, they're giving away $2-OFF COUPONS - I apologize to the person whom I said that there were coupons off for the 'SPRING BOAT/FISHING SHOW'... I got it confused with the 'SPORTSMEN'S SHOW'.....My Fault!  w00t!! I'm gonna be glued to my computer for the next week or so.... whoa! just managed to find 1 ADVANTAGE of being JOBLESS 'cause of the RECESSION........ _ i _   _ i _ _ e _ s   _ n   _ _ n!!  *"
313888,TJQ,2009-03-06 04:35:00,7806,I dunno... maybe giving away free tickets is too spammy for douG.. perhaps I should run it by him first.
