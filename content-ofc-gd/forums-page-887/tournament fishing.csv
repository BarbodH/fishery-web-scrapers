313315,OhioFisherman,2009-03-05 01:15:00,6623,"Dad got me started on the fishing deal, 4 boys and dad loved to fish, it took for 3 of us to one degree or another and just advanced from there.  Tournaments started for me back in the late 70`s, worked with a guy that also loved to fish for bass, dad was a depression kid and fish were food, panfish, walleye. So me and my buddy did the bass deal, open tournaments to keep the schedule free for family.  Joined a club in the later 80`s and fish their tournies, opens and some bigger tournaments. Just my form of gambling, I was outside where I loved to be,and involved in ""the game"" not a spectator.  Every day, every tournament was a separate challenge, a do over, find the answer to the problem, catch the biggest fish the fastest, get a limit. With the bass they got a do over too.  The bass club was a complete accident for me, just happened to be talking to one of my customers one day and some how fishing got mentioned. I told her I mostly fish for bass and she mentioned her son-in-law did too and we met a short time later. He was in the club, mostly guys he worked with but open to all.  No serious issues with the club, a good group of guys, some just got a little crazy with driving distances for a 1 day event, we fished 3 states, 1 days should be kept close to home."

313350,ohhenrygsr,2009-03-05 02:17:00,947,"Hey Pike Slayer well i got hooked on tournament fishing about 8 years ago.  I love the competition and the thrill you get when your blasting off and weighing in.  Some of the key points i picked up during my career in tournament fishing is you can never be prepared enough for the day of the tournament  Pre-fishing is a great way to prepare yourself for tournament day and doing your homework on the lake your gonna fish will make you a better tournament angler and fisherman in general.  Rod Selection is also another critical tool, you can never have enough rods.  But i would have a good selection to cover the basic baits  -A Top water Rod -Spinner Bait Rod -Jerk Bait Rod -Stick bait Rod -Drop Shot rod  Those are the basic Rod setups i carry.  Here is a list of tools and equipment i always carry on the boat when i'm in a tournament.  - Culling system including a balance beam - Rain Gear - Map or GPS/Fishfinder combo - Towel - VHF Radio  Those are just some of the stuff i can think of right now lol  here are some websites you can check out to get an idea on the tournament scene  http://bigfatbass.com/  http://www.bassresource.com/bassfish/bass_...ournaments.html  check them out.  I hope this helps"

314154,fishdawg,2009-03-06 22:24:00,912,time & money are the two main things required to get in competitive fishing  now it all depends too on what main species you wish to fish for and as well what kind of boat motor you have  if you wanna just have some fun and not get totally serious then there are lots of low key derbys or one day tournies for many different species depending on the waterbodies tht are near you. For these a typical modest boat/motor would suit you well
