313688,aplumma,2009-03-05 21:58:00,6896,I have played around with a few of the 70 and 80's cars and in their day they were fast but give me a 2000+ and then we can talk about lots of HP with minimum weight. I would say though if I am looking to be noticed I love the body lines of the older cars though.   Art

313406,kemper,2009-03-05 03:35:00,2232,Cool story...too bad its an Iroc  I would be much more impressed with say a '70 Mach 1 fastback
313415,Bernie,2009-03-05 03:42:00,3190,Mom's 1995 Roadmaster excites me more than that one. junk they were !

Cost 25,000 to fix the engine, breaks everything else that broke from the factory.  Guy figures he might get some money for the rims and trashed the car.  Good old Mid 80's north american made car.  How a lot has changed since the mid 80's"

313586,Bernie,2009-03-05 17:45:00,3190,In 84 all they had was a 305 HO 4 barrel carb. No 350. And they were notoriously gutless wonders. A paltry 190 hp@4800 rpm with somewhat respectable torque 240lb/ft@3200. Somebody put a 350 in yours by mistake -right? Here's my whistle
313590,huey graphite,2009-03-05 17:53:00,362,"Not much of a car enthusiast, but bought myself a '86 RS Camaro in 1990 as a gift to myself for graduating college. I put 300,000kms on it and had few mechanical problems."

313597,bow slayer,2009-03-05 18:08:00,1074,I use to regularly embarress the owners of the Irocs with 350 TPI and all the 5.0 mustangs back in the late 80's with my Buick Grand National. I still own it today with only 90 ks on it.
313608,irishfield,2009-03-05 18:44:00,26272,Bernie... lol  Buy it Darrell and we'll go to Taledaga and see how it does against mine.  
313610,BillM,2009-03-05 18:52:00,17367,"Wayne, did you wipe all of my drool off the car?  lol"
313611,Bernie,2009-03-05 19:03:00,3190,Hop in a Subaru WRX and push the throttle down. 4 wheel peel is an apt description. Love the car! There are others out there too but I really would like one of those.
313613,Raf,2009-03-05 19:05:00,3495, awd is great.. i owned the competition; mitsubishi eclipse turbo awd that wasn't stock for very long.  there is a replacement for displacement - forced induction.

313623,Raf,2009-03-05 19:19:00,3495,  I had a 1st gen.  4g63 was a 6 bolt & bulletproof in that generation.  crankwalk started in the 2g 7 bolt motors. poor sods left by mitsubishi to rot
313634,ecmilley,2009-03-05 19:55:00,2163,"I had several z's and miss everyone of them, can you compare mid 80's power levels to what we have today? a corvette in 85 had all of 230 hp l98 engine. today a zr1 is pushing 625 or so"
313639,Bernie,2009-03-05 20:19:00,3190,"You can't EC. You are right. Had a couple late 70's Z's too. A set of cylinder heads, an intake, camshaft plus a few other fun items....Wahoo we have a car."
