Anyway, I just wanted to know if anyone here makes their own spinners, buzzbaits, in-line spinners etc...? (Aside from KEMPER, whom already posted just recently) If so, what are some reputable companies out there that I can use that you would recommend?  Thanks!!"

Never really played around with them much, a lot of muskie stuff winds up in close out bins here, and some good name brand in-lines for bass also."
