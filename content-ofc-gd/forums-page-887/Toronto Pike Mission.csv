Weather was great today and it was sunny so I was looking forward to a great day. The morning started out by seeing about 20 or so deer just behind our backyard fence.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05  A nice site to start the day off. Drove into the city and tried my first spot but due to the cold sanp we had over the past couple of days, a thin sheet of ice has once again formed and made it difficult to cast. Had to be careful to find open spots. When I got out of the car, the temp gauge showed, 0.5 C   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05  As the winds and currents picked up, larger sheets of ice drifted by. There was some guy there also and he was not having any luck either. He was joined by a buddy of his, and they still had no luck, just like me.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05  After spending a couple of hours at this particular spot, I decided to move to another spot. As you can see the AM temps, even though they were above freezing, still caused my line guide to ice up. When I left the car showed a temp of 5 C   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05  Since nothing was doing, posed for a few pics. Weather was quite nice, actually peeled the jacket off.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05  Moved on to my second spot and this time there were no openings large enough to cast.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05  Time for another picture as my line didn't even hit the water at this location.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05  The ducks were seeing more action than I was.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05  Made my way to my final spot in the city and once again, shut out due to mother nature.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05  Headed back to the east end of the city and decided to try one more spot before calling it a day.  Finally this spot had enough open water to cast. There were a couple of guys at this spot and I asked if they caught anything and between them, they said they landed 5 all together.   By diggyj, shot with DSC-W5 at 2009-03-05  A perfect spot with rocks(rip/rap).  Grab my rods and decided to wet a line for a bit. Started at this spot at around 2 pm and at 2:45 I caught my first and only pike of the day. It was about 20-22 inches in length. Wasn't even worth pulling the camera out as I wasn't prepared and didn't want to take the little critter out of the water for any prolonged period of time. Stayed until 3:30pm and decided to call it a day.  Enjoyed being outside and casting for PIKE even though I only managed to catch one small one. Nothing better than being in the great outdoors and breathing in the cool, crisp winter air.  Dirk...."
