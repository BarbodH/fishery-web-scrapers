Weather was absolutely amazing, when I hit the water around 2 pm the car thermometer was reading a balmy 17 C. Spent a total of 2 and 1/2 hours on the water. Again I was getting frustrated as the action was slow to say the least.  It wasn't until about 3:45 pm that I saw some signs of life. As my lure got just about a foot or two from the shore I noticed a follower but this particular Pike was quite small and it did not take the bait.  Just at about that point the wind shifted and a few large ice slabs started drifting to the east. Made casting a challenge.  Then finally at around 4pm after a small pause in my retrieve I feel a strike and I set the hook. Line starts to peel of of my SHIMANO baitcaster. I am very happy with the Citica 200E, and my Crucial rod.  After a short battle, won by me, I managed to land this 33"" beast. Quickly put it on the scale and it weighed just over 10 lbs. Was a bit chunky in the belly. Let her go to be caught another day.   By diggyj, shot with CYBERSHOT at 2009-03-06  At this point I was very happy. Perserverance finally paid off. All in all, a great late afternoon outing. Great weather, and one fish. Nothing beats the excitment of landing a lunker and spending a day in the great outdoors.  Dirk...."
