314138,waterwolf,2009-03-06 21:58:00,556,"Hit Lake x chasing the elusive 40 in. ghost that haunts this lake (of this I'm sure. lol) Not the perfect conditions for a trophy, but if you don't shoot, you don't score. With bluebird skies, lack of any snow on the ice and a strong wind blowin' , camp was set up amongst these stumps to prevent my gear from flyin' down the lake at Mach 5.    With a late bite, the first pike showed up at 11:15 and was iced without event. Fish #2 was mean, very angry. Had her on for maybe 5 secconds, got off. Checked the bait, adjusted it and sent it back down the hole. 2 seconds later, BAM!! She's back on! While i was removing my hook i saw a deeply rooted hook attached to some mono. Hook was too deep to get at so i tried to trim the mono as much as possible with clippers. She grew impatient and let me know it.   The average fish today 28 in. Dead stickin' sometimes poses a threat to a good relaease due to deep hook-ups. Barbless hooks,  extra long pliers, and  a delicate touch are critical.  Line or leader rash. Ouch.  Best photos of the day are healthy releases. 4 beauty pike went back down the hole.    Days events: 4 iced, 1 lost at the hole, 3 hits missed, a decent day, kept me busy.  Sorry for the lack of imagination with the photos but the cold wind was freezin' the fish up fast, no time to get creative.  Oh yeah, one question, who is this? Perch, Blue Gill, or Crappie?                     (2 in. long) "
314144,GBW,2009-03-06 22:06:00,8460,nice day for sure. the last one looks more like a perch of the 3 you listed but I have never seen one that small to say for sure...
314159,Leecher,2009-03-06 22:34:00,7832,"Great report and pics waterwolf  Looks like you had a good time out there Nasty fight on the 4th pic you had to put up with    Yeah pike are unpredictable and trash a lot when out of water.... hope you are OK and not too much damage to your hand  The last pic, tough to identify, it has the markings of the perch and the V in the tail tells me that it's not My guess is a crappie but could be mistaken.... never seen that kind that small.  Again great job and thanks for sharing Leechman"
314161,purekgw,2009-03-06 22:44:00,585,looks kinda like a rock bass to me and thats one nasty hand lol
314183,irishfield,2009-03-06 23:47:00,26272,That'll teach you to be a caring individual !  Some nice pike there Waterwolf.
314189,Moosebunk,2009-03-07 00:04:00,3970,"Good lookin' fish, not so good looking wounds.  Try and keep the gore to a minimum in your posts dood. lol."
314312,trapshooter,2009-03-07 04:31:00,1234,Good fishing wolf.  I love a good pike scrap through the ice myself.
314313,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2009-03-07 04:36:00,160,thats a pretty hand you got there!!! ohh and nice pike! lol
314317,waterwolf,2009-03-07 04:47:00,556,"do a lot of solo fishing which leads to poor pic. quailty for sure.  irish , you're right ,if  they 're healthy ,, they're releaseed,.  if i get grabbed doin' a good deed next time ,, i might develope an appetite."
314331,gone_fishin,2009-03-07 05:11:00,481,Nice Pike!!! and great release shots! the last pic is a rockbass... check out the red eye!!! perch and crappie don't have that... the only other fish that has a red eye like that is a smallmouth bass... and it's not a smallie!
