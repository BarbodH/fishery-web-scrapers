301885,kemper,2009-02-05 19:37:00,2232,"Its been way too cold outside for me, so i've been tryin out some new jig patterns.  Let me know what you think about them, and if anyones got any suggestions for a pattern ill spin them up. Keeps me busy and sane between studying!                  Is it spring yet??????  keep one eye open for a website comin from me in the future.  gotta get rid of some of these buggers"
301886,misfish,2009-02-05 19:42:00,29133,"Im not a jig man,but they look very nice. Great work there Kemper."
301888,capt bruce,2009-02-05 19:45:00,820,"great looking work there , keep it up"
301890,buckster,2009-02-05 19:50:00,530,Nice work........ u handing out any demos? lol
301892,msp,2009-02-05 19:52:00,1336,Nice lookin jigs. Dont be afraid to try different patterns. You will be surprised what actually works. Those steelies will hit almost anything. Try tipping them with maggots.......absolutly deadly in the cold weather.
301893,kemper,2009-02-05 19:58:00,2232," HA not at the price im currently tying the dang things at. Once I get ahold of a better supplier then well see. Come fishin with me, and you get to demo whatever you want  Yep Ive seen some strange things too, the jigs tipped with pinkies were hot this fall."
301897,Bly,2009-02-05 20:00:00,1556,Nice work Kemper.   Do I detect a bit of sparkle in the second picture?  Hard to tell on my screen.    2 of my favs have a bit of sparkle to them
301898,buckster,2009-02-05 20:02:00,530,
301899,kemper,2009-02-05 20:04:00,2232,"  you sure do detect a bit of sparkle there bly  I cant wait to get out, hoping for nice temps on reading week to get it started!"
301900,Leecher,2009-02-05 20:05:00,7832,Awesome Kemp     Great job
301902,aniceguy,2009-02-05 20:07:00,1094,I ll be happy to field test them for ya
301905,kemper,2009-02-05 20:07:00,2232,  Sounds good.  You'll find me out there from the end of Feb. untill they are gone.
301906,fishnsled,2009-02-05 20:08:00,3520,Very nice Kemper.  These should help off set the costs of your education a bit. Or maybe just give you a few bucks for more fishing tackle.
301918,Mike Pike,2009-02-05 20:37:00,1332,"Terrific stuff, Kemper.  Must be very satisfying making your own jigs and catching fish with 'em.  Keep it up!"
301948,SlowPoke,2009-02-05 21:31:00,2984,Keep them seperate or they'll multiply.
301965,Beans,2009-02-05 22:03:00,3339," I'm thinkin' some of those white ones or pink/white might catch a crappie in the spring depending on the size of the hooks...  Might replace the ""Tony Specials"" EH ?"
301998,kemper,2009-02-05 23:16:00,2232,  oh they sure do!  planning on marketing a crappie/panfish jig down the road too
302011,buckster,2009-02-05 23:35:00,530,  Come on Beans nothing can replace the Tony Specials
302020,bigugli,2009-02-05 23:51:00,6138,Well done
302031,jdmls,2009-02-06 00:08:00,575,"Now all you have to do is get over the fear of loosing them ....  Dude, figure out a way for us to start pouring our own pink worms !!... I am gonna buy stocks in berkley at the rate I was buying them at last year !!!  Temps are looking good in the next few weeks... Soon my friend,  soon !!"
302065,gotguns,2009-02-06 01:12:00,17,"Man, I'm heading to the boat show next week and wan't to buy some of those there or at basspro. Around here pink and white are deadly for walleye. 8-15 ft of water along the weeds and in the pockets. Gotta get me some."
302264,Dnthmn,2009-02-06 08:45:00,128, How bout a trade for a set of steelie flies?
313896,rbaquial,2009-03-06 04:47:00,968,Yo Kemper!! I wanted to get into this stuff too... I just had absolutely no idea on how to go about it...and STILL DONT!  WICKED STUFF DUDE!!
