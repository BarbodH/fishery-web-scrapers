314247,bbog,2009-03-07 02:03:00,665,"I was out today. There is a fair amount of water on top of smooth ice (ankle deep in a lot of areas). Ice is no less than 20"" thick though.  You will need your cleats and watch for holes in the ice. Noticed a few big enough to drop into. After this weekend it gets cold again and should deal with the slop on top. Interesting that there was no slush.."
