314178,trapshooter,2009-03-06 23:39:00,1234,"Hey thanks everyone.  Kelly has been checking out your comments and I think it's going to her head. haha.  Simon - yes, good eye.  I got the jr. version of yours.  Does a good job in my little Fish Trap Guide.  We also cook lunch on it! lol."
313655,trapshooter,2009-03-05 20:50:00,1234,"Kelly had a day off today so we loaded up the gear and hit the ice looking for walleye.  She's not one for the cold and doesn't get out ice fishing much.  In fact, she's never caught a fish through the ice.  Of course, she ends up landing a dandy.... her first fish through the ice ever is this fat 24"" walleye      She played it like a pro on my UL set-up with 4lb test.  We hit a few under 18"" that we kept for the pan, including one that kelly got jigging.  Man, was I ever proud of her hookset - hard and fast!    Here was my prize for the day.  At least it'll eat  "
313657,Joey,2009-03-05 20:57:00,9122,"The women rule once again  Nice fish, congrats to the wife on a fine catch.  Joey"

313672,Lunker777,2009-03-05 21:23:00,866,I was i could get my Girlfriend into fishing. She likes fishing for bluegills and is content. Im trying to talk her into a boat so that we can get out on the water and catch something BIG... well bigger then a bluegill haha  Congrats to the wife for the first fish through the ice ! It was a good one !!!
313692,GBW,2009-03-05 22:01:00,8460,"All nice fish for sure Ben.  lunker, you have access to a dock in the evening during the softwater season?  if so get her to fish with a jitterbug off that dock.  if she get's a nice fish then you are more likely to get her out in the boat.  that is my wifes fav. way to fish, on the dock in the evening BUT she will go out for trips in the boat too now that she has a 2.5LB bass under her belt..."
313700,diggyj,2009-03-05 22:12:00,548,"Holy smokes, her's certainly tops yours. That is one big fat walleye. Great catch and nice report.  Dirk.."

My sister outfished me by far only on her 2nd time ever fishing, and 1st time on the ice, it was the best trip!"
313712,Leecher,2009-03-05 22:36:00,7832,"Great report and pics Ben  Congratulations to Kelly for her first    Monster eye    Beauty Bet she's hook now and won't let you off the hook that easily next time you got out for eyes, well let just say that you won't be able to say that it's for research  Great job you guys.... keep it up and thanks for sharing Leechman"
