311035,rockfish,2009-02-26 03:35:00,91,"Another fine set of toothies there Snag, who woulda thought so close to the big cities and the odd species around the nuke plants. I've been having the same thoughts about being more careful with fish and not lying them on a hard surface (concrete) or in gravel. I always try to unhook my fish on a soft surface, even if the grass is frozen."

313967,snag,2009-03-06 14:24:00,1932,  That might have killed it for me!!!   Next thing you know I'll get some incurable dwarfing disease!  
313979,Greencoachdog,2009-03-06 15:08:00,8163, That only happens when you mix too much Carp slime and cardboard glue!!!  Pike slime and cardboard glue however is mother natures Viagra!!!
313983,ccmtcanada,2009-03-06 15:29:00,7971,Not sure how I missed this report...great job as usual Grant!  I haven't caught a fish since last year...LOL.  Thanks for posting that picture Glen...reminds me I have to mix up some carp chum soon...  As long as we are talking strategies for sign holding...here's another from last year....   Or my favourite....Mike the Pike....   And for the record...Terry photoshopped that perch shot...it was a massive 3 foot perch...
314193,Moosebunk,2009-03-07 00:11:00,3970,"Must be the nightshifts but I think I had deja-vu with this post.  Have you caught a nemo before?  Anyways, good city piking for ya as always."
314194,snag,2009-03-07 00:14:00,1932, I thought they took your key to the cabinets at work away??
314304,Moosebunk,2009-03-07 04:11:00,3970,"No, no, no... maybe that's it.  I think you're right... I have been in the cupboards a little too often.  Perks of being the keyholder, the gatekeeper and the master of the Moose. Hahaha"
309891,snag,2009-02-23 16:07:00,1932,"This is Tony,  He finds and fines poachers etc. I have his business card if anyone needs it.      Met my bro for breakfast way to early and later got into some pike    I tried team, but failed to get the sign in the pic and an accurate measurement. I couldn't feel my bloody fingers.    I refuse to put a pike on the ground for this tourney thing. So I might be useless.  Just a wee fatty    This guy hit hard and put up a nice fight. When I opened it's mouth, the lure fell out. Wasn't even hooked. Just wanted the food??    Nice size too.    O.k. I know I've blurred the pics, but I can tell you that we were near PICKERING.  I admit, I've lurked and stalked EHG's post to get some of those heat lovin' nuclear fish.  Well, here is my first catch from nuclear fisshion'  But what is it Erik?  It shook the hook but I quickly jumped down and grabbed it.     Awwwww, It even has my eyes.  It was released quickly.   Cheers,  Snag"
309892,capt bruce,2009-02-23 16:10:00,820,Great fish as allways snag . been hit and miss at lunch mostly miss last week too cold for me today but thursday and friday looks to be good for lunch ..
309901,BillM,2009-02-23 16:32:00,17367,"Snag, I think you caught Nemo."
309904,salmon,2009-02-23 16:42:00,334,"WTG Snag, as usual great report. The last one was a monster  Jose"
309918,diggyj,2009-02-23 17:10:00,548,"LMAO....that's awsome. Looks like the fish Bart Simpson caught, minus the extra eye. Great report as usual.  Dirk...."
309931,snag,2009-02-23 18:03:00,1932," My son would be bawling if he saw that!   Thanks Jose, my brother had me meet him at 5am that day for breakfast and when that one hit I ""woke-up""   It looked like it was molting so a 3rd eye may be coming!"
309961,smokin joe,2009-02-23 19:36:00,226,Great pics and post Snag well done     Glad to hear that you're thinking of the fish's well being when taking pics and not just laying them on the ground  Here's a suggestion for you that may help.  What about using a clip of some sort to clip the sign in the middle of the tape measure somewhere?  I would think that as long as you're showing an accurate measurement that it would be acceptable.
309970,bigugli,2009-02-23 20:07:00,6138,"As always, nice looking pike."
309971,snag,2009-02-23 20:15:00,1932," Thanks Joe,  The wind picked up to 60mph so I have to figure out a way to do it.  As you said, the fishes well being is most important.   Thanks Ugli!  (sounds funny when I type that!)"
310076,maybe,2009-02-24 00:31:00,307,"I can forgive one or two posts without a tourney sign.  Ask Rowbotham - he took up a place on my team all last year, posted a ton of brag pics to the general forum....and didn't bother to put a team sign in a single one of em.  CCMT had a neat solution last year - if you can't set the fish down, hold the sign in your teeth.  Tadaa!  I think that orange critter deserves bonus inches for cuteness.  Do you happen to have a profile shot of it?  It'd make a fun team banner."
310108,Rizzo,2009-02-24 02:06:00,4754,"right on snag, those are some great looking fish. nicely done"
310162,highdrifter,2009-02-24 04:53:00,2534,Master is pleased.   :closedeyes:  It's obvious that you've found a healthy balance between work and play..  and you're getting away with it scott free ya turd!  They musta just loved how you volunteered for the show on Saturday..  Very crafty..  Esox Incognito HAHAAH!!  WORD HD
310168,Bernie,2009-02-24 05:08:00,3190,Hilarous post! Snag if there is anytime you want to come up and fish with me give me a call. You can wear a mask if you would like to remain anonymous.
310169,hammercarp,2009-02-24 05:08:00,964,"""I refuse to put a pike on the ground for this tourney thing. So I might be useless."" Us carp guys use unhooking mats. They really help reducing damage to your catch and I find that the fish settles down faster so its easier to unhook. I bought a padded beach mat at Giant Tiger for $6.99."
310175,solopaddler,2009-02-24 10:46:00,8605,Nice fishies!
310196,maybe,2009-02-24 13:07:00,307,"Hadn't thought of that, hammercarp - thanks."
310205,ehg,2009-02-24 13:35:00,2666,"Ha Ha, way to go on the pikes there Grant  The humour of this post belies the fact of the difficulty of catching said fishes at this time of the year.  I think that last fish is a nuclearized Northern Big-Eyed Pic (sic). Usually they are netted in that phase and sold to Dollaramas. As long as that C.O isn't watching. Tough identification there.  ehg"
310235,snag,2009-02-24 15:18:00,1932," Sorry boss  I'll try the Cliff trick.  I'll try to get some more pics of the orange critter   Thanks Riz!   That's all that matters...........    Thanks for the invite Bernie! Much obliged!  I don't conceal my spots or beauty outside of the city.  But I'll where a mask if you want    Thanks Hammer,  I still find that pike will flip around and off the mat pretty quickly. The slime will come off too fast. Plus I would have a hard time driving around with a stinky slimed-mat in my car!!    I knew you would know this fish!  Thanks,  It definitely preferred plastic bait over live bait"
310252,hammercarp,2009-02-24 15:56:00,964,Plus I would have a hard time driving around with a stinky slimed-mat in my car!!  Yup. But look at it this way. Your car would smell like sucess!

I actually drop in here when I'm on hold with the phone or some rambling co-worker is standing across from me telling me about there dull kids disasterously dull hockey game.  Oh,  Live person on the phone,,   Sell, sell, sell"
310265,Leecher,2009-02-24 16:17:00,7832,Great report and pics Grant  Beautiful gators....  congratulations Thanks for sharing Jacques

310274,MJL,2009-02-24 16:35:00,2427,"Awesome thread...Too funny  As for the unhooking mat, if the wifey asks about the smell, you can tell her you got lucky with Becky from Marketing"
