313578,Baptiste,2009-03-05 17:10:00,37,I'm kinda partial to the Haliburton and Bancroft area. I can keep an eye on things from home if this link works. http://www.halcom.ca/haliburton.php
313585,Garry2Rs,2009-03-05 17:42:00,1425,"A lot of great places on or near Highway #17 have already been mentioned, but they're too far from the ""Big Smoke"" for me.  I like the North Kawarthas because you have the lower property cost, low taxes, clean water and plenty of great fishing without the five to eight hour drive to actually reach ""Northern Ontario."""
313589,bigugli,2009-03-05 17:53:00,6138,I guess Bala is a good town. Don't seem to remember too much from my visits there
313592,highdrifter,2009-03-05 18:02:00,2534, Moonbeam... for the muchachitas and the back country lakes..  Kenora is very nice also..  I'd go once a week when I worked on a fishing lodge in LOTW.   Think I might just settle there one day!  Goddun Jim!
313602,bow slayer,2009-03-05 18:16:00,1074,for a big town i would say North bay.It has everything you could want and is surrounded by great fishing opportunities. For a small village Restoule I have been going there for 20 years now and will be again this summer.
313604,OhioFisherman,2009-03-05 18:17:00,6623,"Haven`t been to many towns up there Parry Sound, Sudbury, can`t count Pointe Au Baril not big enough to be a town? Some place around Rice lake and Beaver lake when I was a kid, can`t even remember the names of them. All were nicer than Cleveland! Was in Gravenhurst once also, buddy`s uncle had a gas station dinner there, also nice."
313605,ColdH20guy,2009-03-05 18:28:00,312,"Hi guys Just joined today and must say, awesome sight!! thanks I lived in Sioux Lookout for 3 years and awesome walleye for sure; returned home to Coldwater/Orillia and am now partial to Gloucester Pool/Severn River south of Big Chute Marine Railway......bass all over the place.. thanks for all the great reads on here.. cheers"

313627,Billy - Curtiss,2009-03-05 19:23:00,241, I spent a considerable amount of time in Callander in my teens when I lived in Astorville. I would have to say that Sudbury is my favorite northern town. I've got great friends there and the fishing just outside of the city can be amazing.
313632,Fishnwire,2009-03-05 19:39:00,983,"I lived just outside of Toronto (Mississauga) for over five years, and I was homesick for Sudbury the whole time.  I always knew that living down there was only temporary for me and that I'd come home some day.  If I was still living down there I'm pretty sure I'd have blown my brains out by now.  Anyone ever hear of Capreol?  It's just outside of Sudbury.  There are endless miles of bush roads and quad trails back there.  I wish I was there right now."
313633,Billy - Curtiss,2009-03-05 19:48:00,241, Yeah dude. Ever fish Hunter Lake up past Moose Mountain?!
313636,tdotfisherman,2009-03-05 20:09:00,317,"My favourite town away from Toronto is Pointe au Baril.. great fishing and great times. I can't wait until April to open up the cottage, and for May when Pike and Walleye open to fish.."

313665,Peps,2009-03-05 21:13:00,191,"Mckellar, Ont spent my summers there as a kid, not much of a town general store and gas station...great fishing on Manitouwabing lake and some others surrounding the area.    Peps"
313744,gdelongchamp,2009-03-06 00:07:00,199,"McKenzie Island and Red Lake.  Great people, great fishing, great bars, great hunting,  Lived on the island for twenty years, and was minutes away away from my favourite fishing hole. From the house by my island truck to the dock and out to my fishing hole in five minutes or less, with my fifty hp.  To-day it's a hot mining community (Goldcorp and Cambpell Red Lake Mines) and unfortunately the Gold Eagle Hotel on McKenzie Island is long shut down."
313755,Musky or Specks,2009-03-06 00:27:00,2710,#1 choice would be Restoule # 2 would be Nipigon # 3 Wawa #4 Temagami (cant beleive it hasnt been mentioned yet.)

313835,crappieperchhunter,2009-03-06 02:26:00,2582,Bobcaygeon is our Happy place. Has everything Debbe and I need for a happy retirement.  We have a little place in town up there we use as a summer cottage and plan on moving in full time when we retire. Can walk to everything in town and lots of things to do and places to fish. Taxes are less then 1/3 what I pay in Oshawa so that's a bonus too.  I worked for the MNR in the early 80's based on Helen Lake outta Nipigon. Also worked Fire crew outta Armstrong for part of that summer as well. These would be my 2nd choices...but a little too far off the beaten track for Debbe I think...especially Armstrong!!!!
313939,Jer,2009-03-06 12:20:00,1426,"I'm probably biased, and it's not really ""up-north"", but my 'new' hometown of Ennismore is just like paradise (especially having grown up in Mississauga).  Nestled right amidst the Tri-Lakes, almost totally surrounded by water: Pigeon to the west, Buckhorn to the north and Chemong to the east."
313940,Spiel,2009-03-06 12:33:00,9065,I've always had a fondenss for the Meaford / Thornbury area. South shore of beautiful Georgian Bay and central to most of the areas steelhead fishing.

312382,nofish4me,2009-03-01 21:37:00,404,"I've lived in some great places, etc., etc.. One of the places that always intrigues me is, Cobalt. If I could broaden this, it would be the Tri-Town area."
312387,Bernie,2009-03-01 21:53:00,3190,"Powassan has to be at the top of my list. People are friendly, close to schools, good doctors, quiet streets, very low crime and best of all close to Lake Nipissing. O ya............I live there/here."
312403,trapshooter,2009-03-01 22:32:00,1234, Amen.  That's why I moved here.
312571,Radnine,2009-03-02 02:09:00,1538, Congratulations! And good luck with your search.
312573,BillM,2009-03-02 02:15:00,17367,"I dunno if I have a favourite town, but there are certain places that I pass that means I am on my way!!!  Port Severn for example when the Canadian shield really starts to show it's face.   Any of the dirt sideroads I hit when chasing specs, just can't beat the smell for some reason..."
312575,Marty,2009-03-02 02:19:00,873,"For me, it's Sturgeon Falls.  Since I was about 13 years old my dad, brother and I have been making the trip to Nip/Upper French launching out of there.   As fate would have it, years later I met TJ, his wonderful wife Monique and the kids, Avery and Jaden.  I treasure their friendship and look forward to travelling there for years to come."
312578,Guest skeeter99,2009-03-02 02:23:00,0,"I would say kapuskasing  all the lakes up there are 100 walleye a day lakes, with huge pike if you get bored of walleye fishing  and the strip club in town the name eludes me at the moment  but in order for the stripper to dance you had to put a quarter in the jukebox, great times"
312590,holdfast,2009-03-02 02:42:00,1813,Kenora for Ontario  If not Big River SK.  Lots of lakes to explore and Prince Albert is only an hour and a bit away to shop

312616,steelheader42,2009-03-02 03:08:00,44,I would have to say  Restoule so many memories has a kid fishing Commanda Lake.
312620,ehg,2009-03-02 03:16:00,2666,That would be my answer as well. Really like the north end of Pigeon Lake around there. Spent my summers there as a kid
312627,scuro2,2009-03-02 03:27:00,904,"Terrace BC, made an impression on me, the mountains, the rivers...all just stunning. For that far north...the town still has some funkiness, and you can get into some very serious fishing."

312659,Hooked,2009-03-02 06:05:00,891,"  I'll have to agree there jds63, as well as Dorset.  When ever I've spent time on Halls Lake, which has been plenty, I've always found myself in those 2 towns for a visit or 2.  Plus the ice cream is great in Dorset, and the lookout tower there is phenomenal too."

Up north to me is anywhere 75-100 miles north of the GTA or so ! haha  I love being surrounded by trees and water and wilderness... Ive travelled quite a bit for my age(23) Thailand, england, vancouver, mexico, blah blah blah..... NOTHING compares to the great north... In my opinion at least."
312864,wallyboss,2009-03-02 18:33:00,1095,"  Drew, Hearst has always been like that!! I remember a couple of Hockey tournaments there when I was in my teens. (30 some years ago)  Tabernac I was glad to be French!!!!!!"
312873,diggyj,2009-03-02 19:12:00,548,I would say BALA. I always have a blast when I go there. A portion of the weekend is always a haze due to generous portions of alcohol.  Seems like a good idea at the time but always regret it the next day....  headache.
312238,Radnine,2009-03-01 15:12:00,1538,"OK, this is definitely a winter subject. What is your favourite ""Up North"" type town? Those of you from the north might not get this at all, but your towns and bodies of water hold a fascination to those of us that are not. Mine is Bobcaygeon Ontario. I know that it is not really the north, but it is a place that I have very fond memories of, and where the cottage/fishing lifestyle was implanted in my brain. I remember walking along the break-wall down Front Street to the damn, and sitting on the railings at the locks looking at boats and girls. I didn't realize it at the time, but I was goal setting. I now take my family (and my boat) there whenever I can. We still love walking through town on a sunny day and fishing for everything in Sturgeon Lake. What makes it even better now is that I get to enjoy a pint of draft on a patio bar somewhere. Sorry if this comes off as a little juvenile, put it down to cabin fever. Jim"
312246,bigugli,2009-03-01 15:30:00,6138,"Nothing juvenile about it at all. A good part of my growing up was the Muskokas. I still love the small towns, although most are slowly dying.  Coldwater, Mactier, Waubushene and Honey Harbour were bustling towns in their day.  I miss the pier at Jackson's Point. I have had great times in Haliburton and Minden. Have a soft spot for the Soo. It's all about the fun and the memories we attach to these places.  I still haven't seen 10% of this province or fished 1% of it's lakes, but I'm working on it."
312249,solopaddler,2009-03-01 15:38:00,8605,"Armstrong on the cnr tracks N/E of Thunder Bay. So many of my expeditions have begun or ended there, it holds a lot of memories for me."

312255,GeorgeJ,2009-03-01 15:50:00,207,"Bancroft, nice town with neat little shops, Thomas Oliver's tavern, the Timmies has the best view of any I've ever been in ( last week we sat there watching guys climbing the cliff directly across the street) and the the town is very ATV and snowmobile friendly with a main trail running right through town."

312279,JeffBornFishin,2009-03-01 16:28:00,260, If you want some spectacular views of the Eagles Nest go out Airport Rd.  It gives a stunning view from a distance.  Take a drive out 28 East or do the loop through Maynooth to Combermere and back through 28 East.  Fall is the best time.  You can also take Boulter Rd. off of 28 East and follow it through Carlow...awesome valley views to the east.
312292,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-01 17:13:00,10439,The town of Nipigon has always been a favorite of mine. Kenora is another good one so many good fishing spots around.
312305,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-03-01 17:47:00,0,"I will second Drifter's vote for Nipigon.  I was on a work trip up there two years ago and was able to finish ONLY after 4-5pm. In the lower nipigon near the highway we caught silver steelies that were shaped like footballs.  A short drive to frazer lake (a drive to spot) and we could catch our limit of walleye in no  time.  we've had 4 people fishing in a 14 foot boat jigging one and and we still caught limits.  the stretch of salmonid streams in the area are prettier than any other i've worked on in the great lakes...  oh yeah, did i mention the nipigon river!  fishing that river was incredible.  our around average brookie was over 3 lbs with one coming in at 6.  my partner also caught a few nice big whities on his flyrod and fought about a 10 lb laker to the side of our small boat.  it is seriously a paradise."
312313,JohnAB,2009-03-01 18:06:00,178,My vote goes to Sioux Lookout. Absolutely awesome fishing.
312316,DRIFTER_016,2009-03-01 18:17:00,10439, Don't forget the giant Lakers and Brookies in Lake Nipigon.

312370,JohnF,2009-03-01 21:13:00,3494,"Excellent timing for this thread. My plan for next summer is to start hauling my good wife to some of these towns in hopes she'll be smitten and agree to buying a modest little place for us to use in the summer. We're close enough to retired now and we both have retirement work that we can do from pretty much anywhere in Ontario with a bit of planning. I'm less excited about a sandy beach than a nice rocky shore, preferably lots of different ones, and a few bass, pike, and pickerel would be fine. I might even get her interested in fishing again. Keep the suggestions coming.  JF"
