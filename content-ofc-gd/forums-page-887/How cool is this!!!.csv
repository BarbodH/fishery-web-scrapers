313895,Marty,2009-03-06 04:47:00,873,Cool idea.  Just wish I was closer to you all.   Hopefully OFC can help get the word out and make it a great success.
313902,JPD,2009-03-06 05:37:00,296,"hometownhandyman, the absolute master when it comes to trolling Erie's Western basis is Paul Powis who will be covering a bunch on getting rainbows and walleyes out of the Erieau area. There's a good reason why he's one of the busiest guides going!!  The alternative lure idea is one that will be stressed since it can be very valuable, especially fishing trout when everybody and their brother is drifting roe bags around...fish get conditioned and something different is all they need at times...  Great feedback guys, I appreciate it and will work hard to get as well rounded on the whole topic as I can.... speaking of which, I'm supposed to meet Dave in 4 1/2 hours to fish the Niagara!!!  Can't wait!"
313909,danc,2009-03-06 07:24:00,4677, You're kidding. Right?? Seriously.
313928,Roy,2009-03-06 11:42:00,13728,"Dave, quite the trinity you, JP and Paul form. Seems like you've put together a winning combination in a package that anyone within driving distance should attend. Congrats to you...I know you'll be playing to full houses and having a great time doing it.  As for this thread and where it should be placed on this board, in light of the generosity and selfless things you've always done for our community (lots that most people don't know about), I'd post this thread along with any other endeavours you might be entertaining, anywhere on this board that your heart desires.  Congrats to you, I know that this is another winner and thank you for sharing it with our community."
314019,Joey,2009-03-06 16:28:00,9122," Hmmm, not sure what this comment is all about.  Anything that has to do with Dave Mercer should belong in any Section TJ wants on this board, and that's all I gotta say about that.  Joey"
314030,Beans,2009-03-06 16:49:00,3339, You tell 'em Joey...  Maybe someone needs a bit of Joey roughin' up...  
314042,lookinforwalleye,2009-03-06 17:12:00,4399, Doug needs a hug!!!
314043,douG,2009-03-06 17:14:00,2693,"OK, OK, I feel hugged now.  Thanks. I had the wrong idea before.  Sorry."
314102,LeXXington,2009-03-06 19:56:00,1928,How about recording it for a webcast? Be a nice GTG event
314167,Handlebarz,2009-03-06 23:08:00,3790,I will be at the Sarnia one and would like to see the erie section as I still want to get over there to have some fun.  As for the rivers I like the ideas on the flow of the river I notice that the eyes switch from one side to the other when heading up and back from spawn I understand it but would love to learn more about this.  I also fished the rivers in Goderich area and would like to learn some new stuff for it we would use roe some times but I liked spoons any other ideas would be great.  Some lessons on the St.Clair river fishing for eyes salmon and bows would be great as I have never done it there but want to try it out this year.  Are kids welcome for the night?
314217,JPD,2009-03-07 00:56:00,296,"MrEH, kids are most welcome and we hope there are a bunch of them in attendance... this event will be a great family night out for a couple of hours, show starts at 7 and will be done before 9, plenty of time to get the kiddies back to bed  We are looking forward to meeting up with a bunch of OFC'ers at these events, including their families...and you'll love Powis' seminar on trolling.. he really has it down pat!"

313675,BUSTER,2009-03-05 21:28:00,1336,How do we get tickets?
313686,motv8tr,2009-03-05 21:56:00,2587,Very cool...too bad none are in or close to my neighborhood....hopefully one day  Maureen

So please spread the word to all you friends the more the better. Let's pack the house so Subway wants to do a bunch of these in the future!"
313693,aplumma,2009-03-05 22:01:00,6896,Thanks Subway for supporting the local fisheries. You just earned yourself another couple of lunches from a devoted customer.   Art
313733,Handlebarz,2009-03-05 23:33:00,3790,Dave that is very cool I hope to get out for the Sarnia one now to see if I can get the next day off work. Dang I guess we will just call in late LOL.
313746,JPD,2009-03-06 00:10:00,296,"Hey guys, just wanted to touch base with everyone on this seminar series....  This is going to be a really cool deal and unlike anything ever done.... Dave is really going all out to create not only a talk but a show out of the night... he has set up to have two big screens on either side of the stage and an awesome sound system with added videos... this will definitely be a show for the whole family...  My question for this community is regarding the type of stuff that anglers want to hear... I will be doing a ""River"" fishing talk and focus on a bunch of species that are commonly caught in rivers like Walleye, Smallmouth Bass and Trout / Salmon. What kind of information is everyone looking for...  Are things like Specifics on lures, lines and rod Actions something needed, how about stuff like colors based on water clarities or detailed information on rigging options?  I would love to hear what topics are of the most interest... I know this community has a bunch of great contributors and a great cross section of the angling community as a whole... Your thoughts on this would be very valuable...  JP"
313750,GBW,2009-03-06 00:20:00,8460,"well JP my thoughts are; come out to Durham for one of these events   it'a not far for you and Dave (sorry, not sure about Paul) to come out this way... Have a good time guys! Geoff W"
313761,rob v,2009-03-06 00:34:00,535,look'n forward to the London show.  I think it would be good to cover off some of the tried and true techniques plus some of the newer products/theories/techniques.   Maybe a tech talk would be good - how to make best use of your sonar/gps tools  &/or how to properly use them.
313764,Lunker777,2009-03-06 00:37:00,866," Hey JP  I would be interested in knowing the different lures and set ups that are best for walleye and SMB when it comes to river fishing. Maybe some techniques and tips on where to find the fish aswell ?  I havent done much river fishing, so its all REALLY new to me !!! hahah Anything that you decide to cover is going to be valuable !!  Pretty excited for the show guys !"
313767,JPD,2009-03-06 00:49:00,296,"Thanks guys, I am already working on it and have included ""reading The water"" as a major part of it... teaching people where to look for those fish and how to properly use current to your advantage when presenting the bait...  keep the ideas coming guys...  JP"

313797,BUSTER,2009-03-06 01:42:00,1336,"I think that this topic would be great , anything on flowing water and how to read and use eddies,touch on fast current and where the flow slow's down also would be great.....  your secret baits, tips and tricks wont hurt!  cant wait .. i'd be more interested in eyes than SMB"
313852,douG,2009-03-06 03:01:00,2693,"Not spam, but UBERSPAM.  It might seem to some that this thread is all about marketing and selling something.  If that is true, it doesn't belong here.  I support this board, but not this thread."
313853,danbouck,2009-03-06 03:05:00,4380,"Sounds great, I'll be at the Kitchener one or possibly the Brantford one!"
313854,Greencoachdog,2009-03-06 03:08:00,8163, It actually looks like an announcement to me... eh?
313855,douG,2009-03-06 03:11:00,2693,
313867,TJQ,2009-03-06 03:49:00,7806,"Well doug & GCD the announcements have the reply feature turned off.  I thought that a bit of dialog to support two good friends of the board who not only support just about every charity function and tourney, sponsor great contests and just about everything else we do could use a little extra press."
313871,bigfish1965,2009-03-06 03:52:00,3382,"Using your fishfinder in a river has always been a thing with me. I used to fish only where fish showed up, but soon found that currents can camouflage a fish or two...or more. Fishing the French River was crazy that way...baitfish on the sonar..but no walleye, yet drop down a line..fish on! You might do well to help the shore guys. My walleye in my avatar was a shore walleye caught in a large creek...a very large creek, but a creek nonetheless."
313872,Greencoachdog,2009-03-06 03:54:00,8163, You're exactly right Bossman!!!  I was just scolding Douglas about that!!!
313881,JPD,2009-03-06 04:22:00,296,"You're absolutely right Rick, the problem with current is the turbulence, much like how your transducer will be less accurate when your boat is moving with the big motor... there are some settings that can help that on most units but the most important factor is always the transducer mounting... definitely something I can touch upon...  Doug, sorry you feel that way, this is however a completely free seminar series, there is nothing sold at these events it's just about information regarding techniques and tactics to increase your success. Our job is to promote this sport above all else since we all feel that it is without a doubt the greatest past time going..."
313882,GBW,2009-03-06 04:22:00,8460,"ok, when it comes to river/creek fishing with what and how to use other then roe are ideas.  I am just getting my feet wet (so to say) when it comes to river fishing so other things like the gear to use (as well as your other comment JP on reading the water) would be great. Geoff W"
313883,GBW,2009-03-06 04:26:00,8460,"JP, he's just being bitter as he cannot make a show...    J/K!  not to sure what his reason is to be honest but a great reply on your part.  the CBAF is lucky to have you. Geoff W"
