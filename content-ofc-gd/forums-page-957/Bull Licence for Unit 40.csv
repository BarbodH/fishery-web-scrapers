256192,TJQ,2008-10-07 16:19:00,7806,I have a client that has had a last min cancellation and all of a sudden has a Bull Moose License Available for Area 40 (Temagami and area)  This is a good opportunity as there are not many tags in the area.  If anyone's interested PM me and ill send you to my client.

256227,wallyboss,2008-10-07 18:27:00,1095,Are those tags transferable???
256231,TJQ,2008-10-07 18:58:00,7806,"It belongs to an outfitter... so yes,...."
256248,PAZE,2008-10-07 20:23:00,132,Is he giveing it away or is he selling it?  Paul
256315,highdrifter,2008-10-08 00:24:00,2534," Package for 2, including accomodations and a bull tag.  Only a 1000 bones a person!  Don't know how many tags are allocated for zone 40, but we havn't had one for 8 years.  We really get the sour end of that deal eh?!  HD"
256318,irishfield,2008-10-08 00:28:00,26272,If nobody jumps on it let me know TJ... I don't think anyone that I know in the Temagami town site has been able to get a bull tag in the last 4 years.
