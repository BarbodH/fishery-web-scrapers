255813,TennesseeGuy,2008-10-06 01:49:00,957,"You guys boated some nice fish, but there was a whole lot more to the trip than just catching.  Thanks for bring us the report.  One problem though.  I don't think you should have cooked and eaten Dan's hand.  What's wrong with you Canadians?"
255815,irishfield,2008-10-06 01:53:00,26272, Yes there was Connie.... we're just not allowed to talk about it yet!
255825,Wild,2008-10-06 02:13:00,704,Love this report and what a great catch but ... did somebody forget to feed Roy? The ski has a wider mid section!
255845,Mike the Pike,2008-10-06 02:45:00,3421,Super report Wayne and a job well done by Marc eventhough conditions have been tough this year.  good thing you went to Roy's for dinner the hand looked good until ya burnt it

256066,Moosebunk,2008-10-07 01:13:00,3970,"On account of last years bum-whipping you two yahoos put on the Larryskis I would say this years results were a little bit of a fishes revenge.  But, that's fishing... muskie fishing at that.  Dan got the biggest last year didn't he???  Guess you fellas are even now.  Great fish Wayne, GREAT!  Enjoyed the installment doods.  Ti'll next year I guess."
256120,Marc Thorpe,2008-10-07 10:40:00,621,"Hey Wayne and  Dan aka (R...... R.......) Take it like a man  Tks for the wonderful time,once again great laughs and time Beyond the fish we were in stitches most of the time,Dan and Wayne are funny Tks to Roy and J for the great feed,as usual its scrumptious This year has been good,with numbers down somewhat but overall great big ones the same as years previous High water has spread fish out and basically taken their 10 year cycle of home ranges away from them ,so many fish are roaming searching themselves somewhat because of areas previously being low water areas and this year opening many new areas in which the fish can use  I see Wayne you have not had your hair cut yet I think you would look good like this "
