254084,HTHM,2008-09-30 21:19:00,4082,SEE!!! this is what happens when you go to Buffalo to blow a few bucks...
254086,HTHM,2008-09-30 21:22:00,4082,I am looking for some cabinmates for Friday night of this weekend. We will share expenses and stories....
254100,Mike the Pike,2008-09-30 21:48:00,3421,So hometown are you coming to Quinte????In November????
254106,oldphart,2008-09-30 22:03:00,665,"~~~~I've got it stapled to my head ""Your only allowed 4 Walleye"" won't make that mistake again enough said"
254213,HTHM,2008-10-01 03:08:00,4082,That is the plan
254217,ctdd2006,2008-10-01 03:24:00,531,"I've got an older Sea Nymph ""Fishing Machine"" (front and back casting decks w/chairs) I just bought used.....I've always wanted to try the BOQ in the fall!  Is my boat safe there?  Is it worth the 8 hour drive south???  I've mounted a couple riggers on it and it's an awesome mid size lake boat!  I fish the north channel of Huron around the spanish river a lot but we don't get the monsters the BOQ produces!"
254219,Badger Shark,2008-10-01 03:27:00,291,Sorry Steve I have no concept of time or dates at the moment with being off work.  I guess I better check with Andy and make sure that the motel is booked for the Friday and Sat. nights.  I am hoping to get down there as much as possible.
254262,Mike the Pike,2008-10-01 12:12:00,3421,  Yes the BOQ is worth the trip.Quinte is a hit and miss sometimes when the bite is on in November you can be rewarded with several double digit fish when these fish shut down then it becomes tough to entice them to bite.  If you have a 16 ft boat you will be fine.As for downriggers you could use them but if you plan on releasing the big walleye do not go down more than 30ft or there is a good chance the walleye's swim bladder will bloat and the fish could die.Almost the same as a diver who can get the bends.Most will use planer boards.If the bite is not on we ahve a good gathering of OFC members This is the place to be if you want to catch trophy walleye.Perhaps we will see you there.MTP
254327,Headhunter,2008-10-01 15:44:00,5703,"Bumpety bump, for the sake of the lumps! HH"
254331,POLLIWOGG,2008-10-01 15:52:00,835,When you put riggers on keep a pair of side cutters handy as it takes about 3 seconds for a following sea to swamp a small craft when the riggers snag bottom.
254332,Bitsmith2k,2008-10-01 15:54:00,396,"Gerritt, make sure you bring something to lock bedroom doors..  when i've had a few drinks, sometimes i forget where the bathroom is.. good thing corey was awake and pointed me in the right direction last year.."
254345,ctdd2006,2008-10-01 16:44:00,531,I always prefer casting and drifting and bouncing jigs for my eyes.  Is it an option then?   Never used planer boards but would love to try!
254353,Headhunter,2008-10-01 17:27:00,5703,"Of course you can ply any tactic you wish! FYI... the ""biggins"" are coming in from Lake O and staging for their spring spawn. During this time, they are also fattening up for the winter. They follow the schools of bait fish into Quinte, they too are on a spawning run. The key to success on Quinte is to find pods of ACTIVE fish. You could get lucky and find a pod in the area you are jigging, but experience has shown that covering as much water as possible, is the best way to connect with active fish. There are a number of ""spots"" that have been targeted by jiggers and I assume they have a measure of success. I can only relate my personal experience and your chances of catching a double digit Pickereye to me anyway, are much higher trolling planer boards with large cranks. Dipsey's, Lead Core and riggers have their place as well. I hope this helps! HH"
254383,LeXXington,2008-10-01 19:06:00,1928,"  Just booked,  14th and 15th.. Now if I can get the 13th off from the Boss  See you all there"
254495,ctdd2006,2008-10-02 01:36:00,531,Thanks on the info!  I've got the lead core gear we use here for lakers......I never thought of that!  Gonna do my homework on planer boards!  I'm really going to try to make it that way for the GTG!
254496,skeeter,2008-10-02 01:41:00,1907,"are some of the members taking 2 way radio's ? it would be nice to share where they are hitting, and just incase of an emergency??  if so what channel would we use?  Dann"
254510,Mike the Pike,2008-10-02 02:10:00,3421, I know Percher has got one but you can't miss him he will be the guy with the shiny new boat
254759,Headhunter,2008-10-02 19:39:00,5703,Bump... for the sake of those who have missed it! Peter....? HH
254933,HTHM,2008-10-03 03:46:00,4082,OK that didn't work  ...anyone need a cabinmate for the Friday night?
254966,Gerritt,2008-10-03 11:22:00,6129,  Dude... there is just something sooo wrong about that statement... Beer goggles suck!  G
255183,medmart,2008-10-03 22:59:00,587,Hey guys i would like to go so does anyone need a room mate before i book something  Thanks Rob
255306,Mike the Pike,2008-10-04 03:09:00,3421, Memart you have a pm possible cottage buddies
255970,PERCHER,2008-10-06 19:10:00,787,Where is BITME and Pointed?Are you guys going or what? We should do a role call just for Perfect Vue and lets see how many of us will be there.
255975,HTHM,2008-10-06 19:50:00,4082,Good Idea! I will start a thread on just that.
253094,Grimace,2008-09-27 18:49:00,2020,"You guys should look into perfect vue or bayview.    They are closer to mouth of Hay Bay, so if you jet it around the corner you would be at the ferry at about the same time as if at merlands.   The service there is way better as well.    If you guys want to know more about them, pm Superdad.   I think he stays at bayview.    I am not a big fan of merland park either.    I have had a few crappy trips there.            Tip of the bay can handle a bunch of people and has a games room to play poker and stuff in for groups.    They are right in Picton.   Picton Harbour Inn is a good one as well.       That sportsman inn is pretty dingy and you have to take your boat out every night.    We had our truck and boat broke into one year as well at sportsman.     it wasnt anybodies fault, it is just that that parking lot seems to be a perfect smash and grab location as it has a sideroad access with some tree cover."
253100,HTHM,2008-09-27 21:04:00,4082,"Well, someone has to take this bull by the horns. If I can get a consensus on where to stay, I am willing to make the arrangements. So what I ask is that people indicate where the perfered place to stay is, (as I have never been to the area and have NO IDEA what is availible), and let me know what avenue to pursue."
253116,Terry,2008-09-27 22:23:00,14456,well the  Picton Harbour Inn  could hold lots of us but the docks are too far away  maybe we could all chip in a few bucks and hire someone to sit on the docks at night
253118,JohnF,2008-09-27 22:29:00,3494," I wuz gonna suggest leavin' all you guys on the dock, and heading out with just me and the 15 dancing girls. I'd settle for even a few dancing girls in fact, but no guys. I can't handle competition any more.  JF"
253853,Mike the Pike,2008-09-30 02:00:00,3421,"I have booked a cottage at Perfect Vue Resort Nov 13.14,15 with Percher,Glennk and 2 others Joanne at Perfect Vue said there is room for 30 more people 6 cottages remaining.  Or you can book with Tracker and Skeeter at the Picton Harbour Inn hope to see some new and old faces from OFC.  If you want to stay at Perfect Vue Resort call Joann Robins at 613-354-3001  www.perfectvueresort.com  Mike The Pike"
253869,Badger Shark,2008-09-30 02:41:00,291," Come on Steve,  you dont need all that top stuff!  The girls ok but you dont need a full enclosure.  Besides it acts like a giant sail and makes trolling more difficult.  You can come down with Eric and I, we are looking for a third person to join us this year when we go.  And after this past Sat. I cant wait to get out this weekend and the next and the next........  .  Another couple of weeks and they should be in far enough for most people to be able to reach.  Also I see you are joining us for Friday and Saturday the 25th and 26th of Oct.  Hopefully this time you will get a big eye instead of a big pike!"
253950,Headhunter,2008-09-30 13:58:00,5703,Booked for the weekend! Nice people and easy to work with... Perfect Vue here we come!!!! They suggested that the will keep the docks in as long as the weather allows. The only issue that could potentially rise is a low water level they are experiencing could affect the docking situation. HH
253952,fishnsled,2008-09-30 14:04:00,3520,It looks like a good place and a great location.  Unfortunately I won't be able to make it down this year as I'm already booked for that the weekend.  Have a great time everyone!
253956,Headhunter,2008-09-30 14:44:00,5703,We will miss yah Will! I'm sure it will be more fun musky fishin! LOL HH
253973,Gerritt,2008-09-30 16:09:00,6129,"I am also booked @ PerfectVu for that weekend. Joe.. were gonna have a hoot brother!   (edited to insert...Neener, neener, neener... to Merlands)  G"

254005,PERCHER,2008-09-30 17:25:00,787,On to Perfect vue.We will see you all there.Now all we need is BITEME and Pointed to commit and it will be good.Never want to see that other place again.
254020,ccmtcanada,2008-09-30 18:15:00,7971,"Merland park issues aside, Bly and I can't make it to this years G2G.  I was asked to play a gig with a friends band and it falls squarely on the Saturday night of the event!  Hopefully next year!"
254021,Gerritt,2008-09-30 18:19:00,6129,"  Cliff, Cliff, Cliffy..... You suck!  G"
254026,ccmtcanada,2008-09-30 18:23:00,7971, LOL....that's the nicest thing you've said to me in a long time G!

254035,Gerritt,2008-09-30 18:47:00,6129,yup the arm they surgically repaired last year.... sucks for sure!
254039,fishnsled,2008-09-30 19:02:00,3520,"Hey Gerritt!  How are you going to reel in that 14 pounder with your arm like that??  I guess you're heading out for Joe's asparagus wraps, definiately with the drive.    I hope your arm is better by then, I think your going to need it."
254044,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-09-30 19:40:00,1362," Hey Don...I'll see you guys on Oct. 25th, which BTW is a Saturday...  my buddy doesn't want to stay over so I guess it'll be a long day event!!....I'll also be headin' back down the weekend of Nov 8th....after that I'm free other than Muskie huntin' here on the Ottawa R every other day  .....you and Eric should come by here for a day of huntin' with me...

251647,Mike the Pike,2008-09-22 00:55:00,3421,"I will be in Quinte second weekend of November Nov 13,14,15,16 .No merland park for me after paying for a a boat slip and always finding someone else in it .The place needs some organisation but no one seems to care just take the $$$$$ and your on your own.  I will probably stay in a Motel and launch daily .We would need a huge place to have at least 40 members stay there.  Right now I will enjoy September fishing."
251773,legacey,2008-09-22 13:46:00,127,"I don't go but have read on the Quinte Fishing Forum, this is the date for the ""Fall Get Together""  28-29-30 Nov  Cheers"
251799,LeXXington,2008-09-22 15:25:00,1928,Second week in Nov is great for me..  Someone lets make it offical and start some preplanning
251810,PERCHER,2008-09-22 16:09:00,787,O.K its offical the weekend of Nov 15-16.So start booking somewhere to stay. I wont be at the same place as last year but maybe the Picton Harbour Inn or some other hotel or cottage rental place.Any suggestions. And is this weekend o.k with everybody else?
251874,LeXXington,2008-09-22 19:54:00,1928,"Great for me, time too find a location to drink at.. oh I mean fish"
251879,Terry,2008-09-22 20:14:00,14456,"I think some people already booked and I don't know the date for sure.. so lets give it a couple more days and see what everyone has to say if no problems we start booking..  we could start looking around and see if Picton Harbour Inn (if they are open, two years ago they canceled all bookings on us and closed for the winter)and what other place on the water might work for us"
252053,Hawg Hunter,2008-09-23 12:43:00,204,"hello all i live here on Quinte and there is another motel just before merlands called the sportsman motel.clean but across the road from the bay,however you can launch at Macfarlands conservation area just up the road,lots of parking for all. enjoy and watch the wind in the fall it can make or break your trip,i would come for two days just because of this  Taker easy all  Hawg Hunter"
252090,Headhunter,2008-09-23 15:29:00,5703,"Has anyone stayed at Pickeral Park? It looks like they might have enough accommodations to handle a group of our size... yes, it's on Hay Bay, but I know for a fact, that there a number of folks here who have huge issues with the way we were ""serviced"" of lack there of, in the last couple of years! Just a thought and looking for yours! HH"
252206,HTHM,2008-09-23 22:44:00,4082,If I start phoning around for sites how many people do we need to allow for? The one place I phoned last night was closed in November.
252403,LeXXington,2008-09-24 18:24:00,1928, I thought Pickeral Park was camping? Its great but burrrrrr that time of year.
252407,Headhunter,2008-09-24 18:34:00,5703,I looked at their site and it seemed to me they had 2 cottages and a number of trailers/mobile homes available to rent... anyone have any direct experience? HH
252442,skeeter,2008-09-24 20:24:00,1907,you can add skeeter and tracker to the list. we will be there for sure!!!!!

253039,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-09-27 11:37:00,1362, I'd consider going to if Wayne invites me in his kick ass boat for the couple of days with that nice drop curtain full enclosure  Welcome back Wayne

253070,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-09-27 15:37:00,1362,  Terry...that's the whole purpose of the drop curtain....to hell with the other 13 guys...Wayne and I will have our hands FULL
