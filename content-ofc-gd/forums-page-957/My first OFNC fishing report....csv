255954,tipupesox,2008-10-06 17:45:00,167,"It is actually quite common for people to catch muskies in the Fall while casting for kings in the gorge.  I had a friend that fish's the lower river often, he caught (2) muskies last Fall in the Whirlpool area casting for kings with glow spoons."

255896,Troit,2008-10-06 13:38:00,19,"Well i will have to say it has been fun fishing with Streamerguy  , not only for the salmon but for other fish too, he does have a knack for it, as for the salmon that night, was great fishing, on his 30 pounder he had 2 turns left before he was spooled, trying to run along slippery rocks puts a real challenge to it. Most exciting part of the night was the muskie streamerguy brought in, that was 1 heck of a tuff fish, giving him a helping hand with that fish was another challenge just to bring to shore and try and get a measurement or  weigh it,  the things was determined to get away... Looking forward to another great night soon  Cheers  Troit"
