Last weekend i fished below the dam and was rewarded with a few little smallies.  Can't really say I was excited about them,  they were barely big enough to call fish. This weekend however,  i decided to try above the dam with an orange floating rapala.  Immediately it was slammed by an 18"" smallmouth, and the very next cast was hit by a foot long pike.  I could hardly believe it,  all my life i've lived in guelph and never realized what a little fishing oasis the Speed River is!  Thanks to all for reporting on the river and giving me some motivation to get out there and catch some!  Looking forward to heading out to the river again today,  hopefully will have some luck at another spot that has been recommended to me."

255729,Grimace,2008-10-05 23:05:00,2020,Give the guy a break Clamp-it.    It's not like he was in a fishing tournament for charity or anything horrible like that.   Nice fish man.
