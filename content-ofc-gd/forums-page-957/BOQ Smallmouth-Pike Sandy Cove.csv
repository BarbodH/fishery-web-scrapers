256100,leighfns,2008-10-07 04:00:00,103,Recently I moved out of the big city(Toronto) to a place on the BOQ (sandy cove area between Belleville and Deseronto).  I have been fishing the area for around 4 weeks now and have got a couple of Walleye and tons of Largemouth Bass.  I was wondering if anyone could help me out on how to locate/catch the Pike and Smallmouth Bass in this area in the fall...  Thx for any advice/help in advance

As far as pike go, my only catches have been incidentals while trolling for Pickereyes. Most have been caught suspending over deep water, in and around schools of bait fish. HH"
