255556,ccmtcanada,2008-10-05 13:11:00,7971,"Saturday morning at about 830, I got a call from basskicker...he was thinking of hitting a local spot for some morning salmon.  After talking to bly for a minute or two, I got permission to join him for a few hours....LOL.  Anyhow, by 930, we were at our fishing spot.  To make a long story short....I had a fair sized one swipe at my bait....then take another stab at it as I was reeling in.  I set the hook and it fought for about 3 seconds before it got off.  A little bit later, basskicker sets hit hook and feels some nice weight on the end.  Here's a pic of the fish coming in....   The fight lasted about 5 minutes....and we were both very surprised to see how fresh this one still looked.  We were expecting to see much darker salmon coming in this time of year.   Two minutes of reviving and it shot back to deeper water like a rocket!   A few more hits another lost fish and I had to call it a day.  Had a great morning basskicker...maybe next time you'll let me land a fish...LOL.  Did you get any more after I left?"

255559,ccmtcanada,2008-10-05 13:34:00,7971,Thanks Streamer guy....didn't measure the fish....estimate around 15 pounds.
255564,lunkerbasshunter,2008-10-05 14:19:00,2585,nice fish!  it did look in great shape for the time of year!  cheers!
255565,Greencoachdog,2008-10-05 14:20:00,8163,Real nice report and pics Cliff!!!  That fish doesn't look like it's an ounce over 14 3/4 lbs to me though.  I guess the boat is all winterized and put up now?
255598,ccmtcanada,2008-10-05 15:50:00,7971,"Glen....nope...the boat isn't put away yet.  We've been out a few times in the past few weeks, but haven't done well....    I've put enough reports up here with panfish in them....didn't see a need to have another one...LOL.  We'll be searching for some fall muskies in the coming weeks though!"
