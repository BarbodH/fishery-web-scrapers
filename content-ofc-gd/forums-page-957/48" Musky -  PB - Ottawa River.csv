255588,mistyriver1,2008-10-05 15:21:00,600,Real nice fish.  Congrats to your buddy.
255636,johnl,2008-10-05 17:46:00,197,thats a beauty nice job
255673,jwl,2008-10-05 20:29:00,1056,wow that's ones a pig for a 4 footer..got some chunk going down on that baby
255722,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-10-05 22:52:00,1362," It certainly is a GREAT catch for two guys going out on their very first attempt at catching the elusive Muskie...CONGRATS Kevin and Ryan!!!!!!.....  As far as the rod holder goes, they have already been educated since this post on Down-East rod holders and I'm sure that Kev's boat will be equipped with them the next time he goes out for another hunt!!....I'm just tickled pink that these two young fella's were able to get out and catch a 50+"" trophy (which BTW I believe was the size of this fish) and land it and release it quickly like pros!!"
255737,Grimace,2008-10-05 23:19:00,2020,"What a great looking fish.    Congrats,    being pointed in the right direction is one thing but to have patience, trust and know how to capitalize on it is another.     That being said you guys still owe them a beer.   lol.    Cheers"
255752,lew,2008-10-05 23:59:00,12767,"A fat 50""er is a trophy for any serious musky fisherman, but for these 2 guys to hook and then land it on their very 1st attempt, and then to also release it succesfully is absolutely fantastic and congratulations to the pair of them.  Well done boyz"
255761,Rizzo,2008-10-06 00:16:00,4754,ZOINKS! What an unbelievable fish. Congratulations
255765,joco,2008-10-06 00:25:00,57,this is a real nice musky.  its a fat one to.  .  great job boys.  joco
255818,Leecher,2008-10-06 01:57:00,7832,"Guys..... on behalf of Ryan.... "" thank you all for your kind replies..... really appreciate it..... ""  LM"
255833,Wild,2008-10-06 02:25:00,704,For the first Muskie and at that size I say the man's got nerves of steel! Nice catch.
255837,Mike the Pike,2008-10-06 02:29:00,3421,Very well done I hope to catch somethin decent when I catch my first Musky.

255937,Roy,2008-10-06 16:43:00,13728,"WOW!!! That is a great BIG fish! It certainly looks bigger than 48"", and fat too! Congrats to everyone involved."
255450,Leecher,2008-10-04 23:22:00,7832,"Hey guys.... just got news that my neighbors nephew caught a 48"" musky this afternoon on the Ottawa river and this fish is just a beautiful monster ski...... check it out!!    His first ever and PB.... WTG Ryan  Just thaught I would share Leechman"

255454,2 tone z71,2008-10-04 23:26:00,1311,"sweet what a pig,man I gotta make some time for some Muskie fishin this fall"
255459,Streamerguy,2008-10-04 23:38:00,121,Dammmmmmm very nice..... makes my PB look like a runt!!  great catch  cheers Streamerguy
255460,gogu392,2008-10-04 23:44:00,142,"Impresive trophy. Any details about: rod, line, lure, tehnique?"
255462,Leecher,2008-10-04 23:50:00,7832, Gogu.... all I know is that it was caught on a big believer in 8' - 10' fow trolling @4-5mph over a small weed bed.  LM
255463,fishindevil,2008-10-04 23:55:00,6254,Nice fish man !!!!.  ..congrats on your first & your PB !!.  ..cheers
255464,gogu392,2008-10-04 23:59:00,142,Too bad that we don't have the story. The fight probably was fantastic with the beast.
255465,Leecher,2008-10-05 00:16:00,7832, I just sent him an email and see if he can provide me with the details.  Hopefully will be able to post them later.  LM
255476,Rich,2008-10-05 01:01:00,3927,"Quite honestly leechman, the musky I spotted today on the bay was probably that size. I thought it was a huge log until it moved. Wish I could get MINE to bite! lol"
255479,Sandbag,2008-10-05 01:07:00,533,That is just plain awesome...pass on my congrats.  He'll be talking about that one for some time.  Cheers  Craig
255484,Forester,2008-10-05 01:29:00,46,that is huge!
255490,darsky,2008-10-05 01:49:00,586,looks to be bigger than 48
255491,Sebastian,2008-10-05 01:53:00,208,Nice fish
255492,irishfield,2008-10-05 01:55:00,26272,"IT sure does Darsky.. could be the angle or it could be a 58.. not a 48. Nobody will believe my 53.5"" x 24/25 from Tuesday is really that long if this one is only 48 inches!  Beauty fish for sure!!!!"
255494,Rich,2008-10-05 02:00:00,3927,Maybe the guy is 5 feet tall! For real.
255495,Leecher,2008-10-05 02:06:00,7832,Ok guys...... here is the complete story from Ryan: 
255523,Mattones,2008-10-05 05:28:00,587,What a beast! I'm dying to catch a Musky
255529,TroutnMuskieHunter,2008-10-05 11:19:00,1362,"She sure is a beauty....clean, healthy and BIG!!....I'd put her into the 50+"" trophy range...Jacques (Leechman), ask Kevin if he measured right down to the tail??...  We're just heading to the rink now to watch our Granddson play hockey......the boat is all gased up and the gear is loaded..I'll see you here at the house at 9:00AM, and hopefully we'll be able to hunt down one or two of those girls today  Steve"
255549,MAzing,2008-10-05 12:51:00,43," For once someone doesn't guess or add 4 inches to his fish he gets questioned. The fish is at arms lenght so it makes it look bigger. And it's a nice horizontal hold, you can see he's not trying to exagerate his great catch.  What a beauty.  I remember someone posting a 50+ right around this time last year that was a couple of inches short of that one."
255561,darsky,2008-10-05 13:47:00,586,Irish-wheres your report on THAT one??
255566,lunkerbasshunter,2008-10-05 14:21:00,2585,wow what a huge fish!  cheers!
255584,darsky,2008-10-05 15:11:00,586,that fish is a GREAT catch and a lucky catch by the looks of the rodholder. I am pretty certain that set up is NOT meant for the trophy class fish that swim in that river. Please consider a Down East set up or possibly a Scotty. Both are meant for fish of the caliber in your picture. Feel free to pm me if you need more info.
255587,darsky,2008-10-05 15:16:00,586,  a couple inches short of this one is still a fifty and the fish is not at arms length-his head and back are arched a bit back.
