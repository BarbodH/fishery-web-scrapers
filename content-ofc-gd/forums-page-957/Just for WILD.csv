I did cook up a pot of ""Fish head soup""  but it was inhaled before I could take a pic.  A wonderful old Finnish recipe of my Gram's."
256109,Wild,2008-10-07 05:56:00,704,Hey beets are ok but I would rather have a blueberry pie! Picked up a few baskets of peaches plums  pears and a bushel of courtland and mac apples at the farmer's market this weekend too. Oops can't forget the pail of clover honey. Schnitzel was the weekend feast along with  plum dumplings and apple crumble
