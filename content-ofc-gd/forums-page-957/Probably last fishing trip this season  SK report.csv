255701,holdfast,2008-10-05 22:02:00,1813,"Well I decided to try my luck out at Hackett lake for my final fishing trip, at least with the outboards.  I trolled and trolled but only came up with two small jacks.  I decided to pull out my 4lb ultra light and fish frozen minnows for pickerel.  I would use a small bait hook with a slit shot and cast and slowly twitch it back along the bottom.  I caught three small jack that thrilled me with their fighting, when I hooked this monster on a minnow barely an inch.     Just to show you this Pike could of ate my reel and rod in one gulp.  Thanks to the Daiwas smooth spool I was confident when it made its huge runs.  When it did surface I could see it was lip hooked and it was not to secure looking.  I had to act fast and gently no horsing this monster    This is definitely my biggest this year and possibly last years although I wish I had a picture to compare.  Incidentally last years big pike was caught on a small jointed Rapala while I was trolling for pickerel.  Only regret is that Hometown Handyman wasn't around for this one.  Sheeeet Happens I guess.  Pike was released for next year.  "
