255875,singingdog,2008-10-06 10:02:00,1047,"Nice jigs. Rabbit fur is the bomb. IMHO it has better action than marabou. If you want a slightly different look, and the ability to hold scent, tie the contrasting colour on the back with a short zonker strip. The hide side holds scent for a looong time and gives a slightly different look. Pink zonker strip with a white collar is a good pattern. Black zonker strip with a flouro chenille collar makes a great egg-sucking leech."
