255888,Chris Cross,2008-10-06 12:55:00,46,I got out on Kemp bay yesterday with Pockets in the team pockets smokercraft. We got at least 50 perch EACH . They were biting just about anything.  I found a very small neon green grub on the smallest jig worked best. We found a couple good honey holes. They seemed to be 15' to 20' of water right near bottom. Abit of motion made the bite. To bad I have to work today. (I'd love to go back today) CX

256093,Cudz,2008-10-07 03:21:00,2652,friend of mine was at the flagpole in barrie.  About 25 ft of water.  You can't keep them off your line.  He said no jumbos.
256170,Scott S,2008-10-07 15:12:00,203,Was out on the weekend also. Lots of perch but nothing real big. Jumbo's haven't come in yet. Scooter
256228,Fisherman,2008-10-07 18:33:00,7201,"I went out this morning for a couple hours, not quite jumbos, but,  close enough to call them keepers.  Caught half on little gold coloured Slurpee jigs and a couple on the ""Bug"" jig, minnows not required."
