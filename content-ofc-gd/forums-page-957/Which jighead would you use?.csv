255863,wuchikubo,2008-10-06 05:22:00,1114,"Talking to another friend of mine, I was turned onto the idea of tying up some jigflies for some rainbow trout. My question to those who tie them, which style of jighead works best and would you look for a certain manufacturer?  Thanks,  Stan"
255873,singingdog,2008-10-06 09:56:00,1047,"I would look for a decent hook, period. Lots of hype about jigheads. They are just a hook with some lead on them - and - if you fish them hard they are nearly disposable. If you find someone that pours, you can usually get a good deal on them in bulk. I tie lots of trout jigs on 1/16 oz heads that I get from a local tackle maker. My only criteria is that they use quality hooks.  Weight and size will depend on how you are going to fish them. Most folks that are using super-light salmon/trout jigs are float fishing. I don't use a float most of the time, but fish very fast water that keeps the jig off the bottom without a float."
255882,cplummer,2008-10-06 12:09:00,165,my prefrence is the bead head jig.. the heads out of the way of the tie and it looks great... All my jighead ties are on quality hooks  ( daiichi)
255897,dannyboy,2008-10-06 13:41:00,367,"I like Cliff's way, here is a good tutorial on tying bead head jigs. If you want to use jig heads look in the crappie fishing section, they go down to 1/32 oz and are made with quality hooks, repaint them if you don't like the colour.  Dan"
255922,kemper,2008-10-06 15:10:00,2232,"for trout stay away from jig heads, you will be retying all day because they seem managetic towards bottom snags.  Go bead head on Daiichi hooks, you will not be let down!"
255930,blaque,2008-10-06 15:56:00,2419,"I use the ever popular: nickel plated bead, pin, and 90 degree jig hook. Put the pin thru the bead, wrap that to a #4 owner jig hook and tie on your favorite recipe.  "
255947,wuchikubo,2008-10-06 17:12:00,1114,"Thanks everyone for the suggestions so far,  Blaque's suggestion is exactly what I'm trying to do.   I'm still not sure what you mean by using the pin. The picture you provided wasn't clear for that. Does the eyelet go through the hole of the bead? Then put the pin through the hole to take up space and trim the pin?  Where about is the best place for beads for this application in the north scarborough / markham area?  Thanks,  Stan"
255958,dannyboy,2008-10-06 17:58:00,367,"Check out the tutorial I posted the link to above, it shows exactly how to do it - very simple. Fishing stores that stock fly fishing supplies will carry them, same places you would find the jig hooks.  Dan"
255959,wuchikubo,2008-10-06 18:11:00,1114," Thanks Dan, I forgot to check the link reading through the replies.  Now, I have some work to do to get some new flies tied up.  Stan"
255960,blaque,2008-10-06 18:11:00,2419,"Here is the gist of it, and yes, i have too much time on my hands at work  I use #4 owner jighooks, nickel plated beads in various sizes and weights, and simple pins......like sewing pins, You just put the pin thru the beadhole, hold the pin with your thumb and forefinger on the shank of the hook, and wrap it onto the hook. (the pink coil is supposed to be thread lol)  "
255967,wuchikubo,2008-10-06 18:45:00,1114,Thanks Blaque
256028,drwxr,2008-10-06 23:30:00,453,"Blaque is that your reflection on the bead ?  nice work though, add some marabou when you get bored again."
256133,blaque,2008-10-07 12:07:00,2419,"lol, no that is a default image that Autodesk has attributed to images with reflection. Think its just a parking lot with a guy standing in it. lol Looks like hes holding a pumpkin or mooning us lol"
