Looking at the weather, most likely Tues/Wed as they're only expecting 5-10km winds and sunny..  Now, I took him to Pigeon last fall and he got himself a decent muskie.. Now he has asked me to take him somewhere for walleye where he wants to anchor up, and fish with minnows or worms.. (good sleep for me ).. I don't have my boat anymore, so we'll be out in his for the last time..  It will be forsale after this fishing trip...  It's too early for Quinte and him being 75, he's not much for the colder weather... Since I do the very odd live bait fishing trips I'm in need for some help to make me look good..  So, here's my question to you all livebait and walleye experts.. Where can I take this man and get him a few fish ???  Any tips/locations/maps would be of great help...  You can PM me if you like and your secret is gold with me..  Thanks,  Tiz"

Short ride (10 min) up the channel to the main lake, and right where it opens up, fish around there. Here's a couple of weblinks: http://www.reachharbour.com/  http://buckhorncanada.ca/"

255944,fishnpro,2008-10-06 16:53:00,93,Cant go wrong with scugog. I hear they have been doing pretty well for walleye lately. Try fishing the buoy markers in front of Goreski's or the ones just north of those.
