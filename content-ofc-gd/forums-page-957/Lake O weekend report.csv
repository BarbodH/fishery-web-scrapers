255767,rhare,2008-10-06 00:27:00,387,"Headed out of Port Credit to 400+fow east of the ODAS marker. Got the rods set up at about 1030am and started trolling and trolling and trolling. Worked around for about 3 hours without moving a rod. Finally found some active fish and started circling. Within 2 hours we went 9/11 6 chinnys and the rest bows. Went back out this morning and went straight back to where we left off. fished the same very small area and went 10/13, 2 chinnys and the rest bows. Picked up a real nice bow that was just over 35""  and I'd say around 13lbs. All fish came off the riggers down 90ft and 70ft over 420fow. Blue dolphin spindoctor with a gold/pearl A-TOM MIK  was the hot stick, few fish off the white and blue spinny with the skiens machine fly.  It was a great weekend on the water, wind was chilly but at least the rain held off.              "
