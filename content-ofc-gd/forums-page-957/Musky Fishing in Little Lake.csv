256332,Rich,2008-10-08 01:11:00,3927,Tough water. There are some to be caught though. When I lived there I saw numerous fish over 40 inches but they had seen so many lures it was certainly a tough bite. I think the only one I ever hooked was while I was bass fishing with a 4 inch jerkbait and no leader.. so unfortunately that fish got some permanent lip gear.
