256021,napjohn8,2008-10-06 23:04:00,46,Hey guys i fish the islands all the time in may for pike and summer i had no time to go and then went for salmon season on the credit. I am curious with the cooler water temps and colder temperatures what fish will i catch if i got this weekend?
256064,Greencoachdog,2008-10-07 01:05:00,8163,You won't catch anything if you don't go!... and who's to say what you will or won't catch... many surprises happen on the end of a fishin' line!
256069,Rizzo,2008-10-07 01:22:00,4754,with the cold weather at least you won't catch any of those nude sunbathers on that boys only beach out there
256076,Greencoachdog,2008-10-07 01:42:00,8163,  Sounds like you've been there before Rizz?
256085,BabyHerc,2008-10-07 02:32:00,285,Salmonds and pikes.
256089,Mike the Pike,2008-10-07 03:05:00,3421,I know some have caught chairs and a Bike
256107,HTHM,2008-10-07 05:05:00,4082,You might catch a fish.....or if you're on the beach you could catch ....(well you fill in the blank)
256125,Marko,2008-10-07 11:03:00,854,"I would think you could catch bass, pike, salmon and maybe even odd trout. Not sure if carp are still biting."
256154,wolfville,2008-10-07 14:05:00,396,At least the temperature won't be as low this weekend so I'll say you won't catch a cold if you dress properly. (it can still be cold in the morning/night even with 20 degree daytime high)
256159,BITEME,2008-10-07 14:24:00,1969, YOU DONT CATCH A COLD FROM THE COLD
256195,mepps,2008-10-07 16:38:00,1301,"There always a chance to catch a pike, bass or salmon - but fishing is really tough this time of year at the Islands!"
