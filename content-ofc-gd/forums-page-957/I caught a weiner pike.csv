Caught this 22 incher yesterday at Mountsberg on a J-13 in orange right after the rain stopped at 12:15. Also caught two others including this one that hog tied itself on both trebles.  Everyone I talked to was having a hard time out there catching one or none at all. Other than the rain it was a nice day for a paddle and the fish were just a bonus."
255690,BillM,2008-10-05 21:34:00,17367,Poor fish is going to starve to death.
255692,MCTFisher9120,2008-10-05 21:45:00,3761,A sad sight indeed...poor fish.
255694,jwl,2008-10-05 21:46:00,1056,"well at least it wasn't the other way around and the pike was catching the weiners  , it almost happened to a buddy of mine once at my camp with one about 40 inches...after he god the hook out ,he was handling the fish to let it go...the fish turned around and chomp!, right on the leg of his shorts"
255702,joonmoon,2008-10-05 22:05:00,528,Gotta luv it when you can dial in on a pattern that no one else seams to figure out when you're out there eh Bro! Good job at least the rain didn't stop ya from goin. Keep yur gear redy and we'll get out again before its too cold.    Maybe that skinny pike should eat something other than lures and it will gain some poundage.
255707,Rizzo,2008-10-05 22:14:00,4754,because its so skinny it actually looks more than 22 inches. pretty sickly
255709,Greencoachdog,2008-10-05 22:21:00,8163,"I'd say that Pike probably has a blockage of the gullet like a hook or jig, or a large plastic bait in it's gut that it can't digest or pass."
255710,irishfield,2008-10-05 22:21:00,26272,All I see are red x's !
255847,Mike the Pike,2008-10-06 02:49:00,3421,You should start feeding the fish in that lake they are so hungry they bite from both ends  You should contact Unicef these fish are don't have anything to eat
255851,Wild,2008-10-06 02:56:00,704,OK I really don't want to go there but your buddy has 40 or the fish was 40
255891,ricoboxing,2008-10-06 13:22:00,398,that pike looks like a supermodel!
255900,Marko,2008-10-06 13:44:00,854,Suprised to see pike that skiny being an agressive fish and all. There has got to be some small bass in Mountsberg to feed on. Maybe its just sick.
256073,Dozer,2008-10-07 01:31:00,896,An anorexic pike.
256083,Mike the Pike,2008-10-07 02:28:00,3421, Lol   now that was funny
