255677,bigugli,2008-10-05 20:45:00,6138,"Just another little backpack diversion yesterday afternoon.  Wifey is doing one of those major reshuffles through the house and I prefer not to get in the way. I get into enough trouble already. Went for a change of scenery and hit some shoreline along the Lower river. First stop produced nothing, nad, zilch. Not even a goby. Second spot was at one of the bridges. Now, when I am beating shoreline I carry 2 rods. A baitcaster and an ultralite rigged for float fishing. Under the bridge was panfish heaven. Every pitch with the float brought another slab gill or crappie. This went on for a good 2 hours. That was fun but no predators around. They all got C & R treatment as I already have enough pannies in my freezer for now. Picked up and moved to another spot. Finally found something a little more aggressive. Found a pair of snotters hovering by the one weed patch.   Walked down another 60 feet to a patch of grass and rushes and found me a path. Took me to a nice little ambush with just enough space for a few fan casts to the edge of a slop matte.  In that one little spot there was a nice little school of bass. No monsters but I did get 6 to come out and play. They were hitting the spinnerbait within 2 or 3 turns of the handle. Check out this piggy:   The rest were a more respectable size.  All caught with the space of 1/2 an hour. One more teaser pic.  I was too busy to take any more pics.   I was gonna run out again today, but I was given the dreaded  ""HoneyDo"" list. Busted"

255823,bigugli,2008-10-06 02:10:00,6138," On the pannies. Gills ran 6-9"". Crappies anywhere from 8-10"" ."
255826,bigugli,2008-10-06 02:14:00,6138,"Yup. Cut the grass and cut wood. Start clearing out the junk in the workshop, decide on what I'm throwing out and keeping. Got a bushel of beets dropped off at the door for canning. $5 a bushel's pretty cheap. We'll be canning into next evening."
