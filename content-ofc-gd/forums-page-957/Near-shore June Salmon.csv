255915,chilli,2008-10-06 14:29:00,199,"Make sure you call and report it to the OMNR! and Jeremy Holden [email protected] If you catch any more, consider taking a scale and forward to the above contacts. This is the best way to ensure research and monitoring."
256055,rhare,2008-10-07 00:50:00,387,"is that where they are all hiding in 20ft??  very cool, good stuff on the release"
244664,Master of Bait,2008-08-29 21:19:00,196,"Hey guys and gals,  I promised a while back to post a pic when I finally developed a roll from the disposable camera I use.  Anyway, that was June, and now I finally have the pics (will buy a cheap digital soon)!  Anyway, the fish in question is a salmon I caught while flatlining in 12 feet near shore on June 20th.  I just thought it was interesting to see just how cold the water still was at that time.  My guess is that it's a coho but, since I took the pics with a disposable, the pics are not that clear.  Here are the two shots I got:     Also, on a funny note, I caught a white bass and a sucker on the same rapala crankbait within about an hour in the same general area.  There's just nothing more exciting than crankbait suckering!   Cheers,  MoB"
244666,danbo,2008-08-29 21:22:00,2646,Atlantic!
244673,Paully,2008-08-29 21:55:00,712,I've seen where these usually go...
244677,salmon,2008-08-29 22:02:00,334, I agree http://www.thefishinguide.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=5263
244691,fishnsled,2008-08-29 22:50:00,3520,I'll second Atlantic.  Thank to my recent research and tutorial on fish identification.  Thanks Tony!
244692,steverowbotham,2008-08-29 22:53:00,1800,"I'm pretty sure its an atlantic!  If so, thats awesome!! I hope it was released, it would be awesome to see a return!"
244699,LeXXington,2008-08-29 23:24:00,1928,Atlantic --- congrats
244721,BabyHerc,2008-08-30 00:20:00,285,How'd she taste?
244750,steelhead hunter,2008-08-30 01:07:00,152,nice atlantic I hope you let it go since they are catch and release only

244822,Master of Bait,2008-08-30 02:46:00,196,"Hey guys,  That's really cool about this being an Atlantic.  Thanks for the Id.  Who'd a known?  As for the regs, don't panic, the fish was, in fact, released!  I usually try to refain from meat hunting in Lake O.  By the way, I think I read something once about ministry people asking for angler info on Atlantic catches.  Anyone know about this?  I'd send them a link to the post if I knew who was tracking catches.  Cheers,  MoB"
244824,douG,2008-08-30 02:55:00,2693,Epic catch.  Hope we see many more.
244917,Remo,2008-08-30 17:27:00,33,You can contact Chris Robinson at: [email protected] or Credit River anglers at: [email protected] Great catch by the way.....was it acrobatic?
244935,StrealHeader,2008-08-30 18:40:00,56,"Yes please report where you caught the fish and exactly what bait you used to CRAA, for ummm research purposes"
244941,highdrifter,2008-08-30 19:05:00,2534,"LOL.  Funny how people seem to jump on the Atlantic bandwagon everytime..  I believe the hopes of seeing a salmo salar are so great that it kinda creates a euphoria where anything remotely resembling this fish would be deemed an atlantic.  Those are all really kewl catches.  And Master of Bait, that's a great technique for early spring...  I'd love to try it!  But those are not Atlantics.   First fish (might) be a coho, and that second fish, is a chrome brown trout.  I won't post links, and am not interested in continuing on with this thread, but I'd be willing to bet that if these pictures were shown to a fisheries biologist, of even better, if you kept scale samples and sent them in, the id of the fish would be confirmed to be another species.  Flame away, but before you do, I'm sure that there are others here who share my idea.  People such as myself who have worked in fisheries and have knowledge of fish taxonomy.  Nice thread!  Let's keep it civil.  cheers HD"
244955,Remo,2008-08-30 19:59:00,33,"From what I gathered of Master of Baits post both those pics are of the same fish. Perhaps he can clarify as it looks to be the same fish to me. Forked tail, no spots on tail and the tail has a thin base my guess Atlantic. Be interesting to get it confirmed."
244995,steelhead hunter,2008-08-30 23:06:00,152,my bad CLofchik c&r is for the river only
245006,StrealHeader,2008-08-30 23:32:00,56, Its the same fish  :lol:
245019,steverowbotham,2008-08-31 01:03:00,1800, Those who have knowledge of fish taxonomy would know that brown trout dont have forked tails

245152,cplummer,2008-08-31 15:58:00,165,100% atlantic.. good to see it was released back to it's home so it may have the chance to spawn..
245153,bassjnkie,2008-08-31 15:59:00,1101,"I for sure would be the last to know the type Salmon. But nice fish,WTG"
245201,ehg,2008-08-31 21:26:00,2666,"Beautiful and rare Atlantic salmon you caught there. Catching a sucker on a crankbait might be more rare. Thanks for finally posting these, ehg"
245209,Greencoachdog,2008-08-31 22:07:00,8163,  Salmo salar tard!!!  
245573,Master of Bait,2008-09-01 20:58:00,196,"Hey guys,  Yup, both shots are of the same fish.  I was solo so I netted him, snapped a shot, he flopped out of the net, I snapped a second shot and tossed him back in right away.  No harm, no foul, he looked fine swimming off.  Thanks for the contacts for Atlantic Salmon info.  Will pass along.  Cheers,  MoB"
