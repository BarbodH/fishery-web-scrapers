252153,Terry,2008-09-23 20:06:00,14456,sorry to hear....  I had a problem with mine I took it for service up to Midland and 3 days later they had it done no charge I loved the service I got....
252347,legacey,2008-09-24 13:32:00,127,"I'm glad this came up......I bought a MG Pro Series #70 in March of this year at BPS. About a month ago, it was causing problems and now, I get only 2 speeds.  I have to take it in to the local MG rep. The problem is this...when I bought it, I did't open the box, knowing I'd never get it back in properly. About a month later, when I was getting the boat serviced at DC Marine in Kingston, I also had them install it for me.  Since I've now had the trouble, I've checked out the MG web site and it states that you have to send in the proof of purchase and copy of the receipt to have a valid warranty.  Not opening the box at all, I never thought of having to do so.  I have the original receipt from BPS that I looked at last week. Now the problem is, after purchasing all of my fishing stuff at BPS,  I folded it in my pocket then put it on my bulletin board in my office. Of couse, now it's faded and the folded area is where the trolling motor is listed so you can't read it. The only tell tale sign is the amount on the receipt...it's obvious that the lure wraps I also bought aren't worth the $800+ that is final $ total.  So, did those that have had warranty issues submit the warranty card and receipt after purchase or am I    screwed?!?  Cheers,  Paul"

255870,Greencoachdog,2008-10-06 09:48:00,8163,"That's too bad, what kind of motor did you have before and why did you get rid of it?  I don't think not having a trolling motor would keep me from fishing for 10 weeks!  Maybe you should see if Rolls Royce will make you a trolling motor, so when it breaks down they'll fly a mechanic out to fix it for you... instead of waiting your turn for service."
