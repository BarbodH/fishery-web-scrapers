The FMZ17 Council, with MNR and OFAH, is holding this evening walleye information workshop on Oct 24th in Peterborough. It's open to the public and free to attend, but registration is required because of limited seating at the facility. Some seats are still available.  Full details and contact information are at http://www.ofah.org/fishing/fmz-17-walleye-workshop"
