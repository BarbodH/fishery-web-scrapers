738160,Skipper D,2012-10-20 11:37:00,1970,"Strong and dependable is my old dog ""Ram"" , if your looking for a good one he's still fiesty for and old dog and he puts all the others to shame when i cut him loose in a swamp i'll tell ya .............nobodys ever seen a dog like him , but no matter if theres 3,5,10 guys out there shooting at the same time , he go's grabs all the bird and delivers them right to the guy who shot'em , and when he's not doing that he's out in the middle of the swamp jumping up and down pointing at the birds that are fyling in yelling 'SHOOT' that one  SHOOT that one ! , you got Tundra that far along yet BBgun ????????????"
738169,Billy Bob,2012-10-20 12:51:00,5865, TUNDRA is MUCH BETTER.......she brings ALL the ducks to ME....
738190,ch312,2012-10-20 15:27:00,1590,good stuff.  i was lucky and my fox red yellow lab is a natural. with no training i took her on her first goose hunt when she was over a year old. first flock = 3 shots and 3 geese retrieved out of the water. works for me
738460,Billy Bob,2012-10-21 12:35:00,5865,Looks like I will be taking the Queen of Labrador later today for another duck field training exercise.......hope she's does as well as the last time.......the only thing I don't like is she smells of the swamp and I have to give her a bath as soon as I get home...and the truck smells like a swamp for a day or two...  ...so I have to clean up both TUNDRA'S....
738467,Skipper D,2012-10-21 13:05:00,1970,"I can't hear ya right now Bob , my dog Ram is out running a round here yelling SHOOT'EM ! SHOOT'EM ! and there's to much gun noise"
737597,Billy Bob,2012-10-18 12:41:00,5865,"Been busy training my proud puppy since I got her back in August of 2011  She hasn't been out on a real duck hunt but our season opens in less then 10 days now.......she's only a little over 1 year old and I know she will still need lots of REAL DUCK retrieving training...but she does have a GREAT start so far...  Here's she sitting....waiting for the BANG BANG...I got one Tundra...go get it command.   Then her swimming out to get it   Her Swimming back with her ""Wooden Duck""     And finally Tundra enjoying her reward treat "
737599,lew,2012-10-18 12:44:00,12766,"Good looking pup Bob, just curious though, is that a life jacket he's wearing ??"
737600,Luke V.,2012-10-18 12:44:00,286,Right on Billy Bob. She's a real beauty. I'm sure you will have a successful season.
737601,Billy Bob,2012-10-18 12:47:00,5865, YES....it to give her added flotation and it had a built in chest protector on it....she really doesn't need the added flotation in the swamp...but definitely a good idea for the Niagara River in the second half of the season...  Edited to add..... http://www.cabelas.com/product/Cabelas-5mm-Neoprene-Flotation-Vest-with-Armor-Flex8482-Chest-Protector/732700.uts?WTz_l=SBC%3BBRCatalogCustomerReviews
737605,lew,2012-10-18 12:51:00,12766,"Thanks BB, definetely a good idea."
737614,Headhunter,2012-10-18 13:23:00,5703,Hillary is looking great BB! HH
737622,RangerGuy,2012-10-18 13:48:00,564,Nice pup!  You won't need to those treats once she gets a few real ducks  How's she doin on running blinds?  Your gonna love that vest man.. It's very tough! My Suzy launched herself out of the boat after a bird I drop and landed on a stick which I didn't find when checked the area out after setting up. If she didn't have this vest on we would have been rushing to the emerg... There isn't even a mark on the belly of the vest.  She grunted when she landed that's the only way I knew she hit something.  This vest is 5 years old and still looks like new! 
737629,NAW,2012-10-18 14:06:00,4022,Good stuff BB.  You two must be getting a pretty excited about the up-coming season!  Make sure you post a report with your success.
737637,mercman,2012-10-18 14:27:00,7054,She's a real beaut Bob !!! Can't beat the smarts of a good Lab:good:
737670,Billy Bob,2012-10-18 16:15:00,5865, Those two could be TWINS......  Glad to hear the vest did it's job and saved her from a serious injury...
737671,Billy Bob,2012-10-18 16:19:00,5865," HILLARY....that's one UGLY WITCH (witch is not my first choice) if it's the Hillary I am thinking of....TUNDRA is a PURDY PUPPY....You call my puppy that again, and I'll beat you with that wooden duck...."
737693,SlowPoke,2012-10-18 18:01:00,2984,You should have called her Ram or Sierra
737748,Billy Bob,2012-10-18 20:40:00,5865," WHY.......I don't want a dog that breaks down and can't do the job...she was named to be BIG, STRONG and DEPENDABLE...."
737754,Headhunter,2012-10-18 20:53:00,5703,Sounds a lot like Hillary to me! LOL I'll be keeping an eye on the sky for the wooden duck BB! HH
737759,outllaw,2012-10-18 21:00:00,1232,those are sweet pics guys. theres nothin better then a good gun dog in a hunters life.
737889,Sinker,2012-10-19 10:56:00,8692,She's lookin' good Bob. Bring her up and we can get here started early.  S.
737890,Billy Bob,2012-10-19 10:56:00,5865, You would never know she's a gun dog the way she cuddles up with my bride on the couch......  :wallbash:  ...I'm hoping she's not too spoiled to hunt...
737893,Billy Bob,2012-10-19 11:06:00,5865, OH........my hunter partner Don would LOVE to hunt up by you.....
737918,limeyangler,2012-10-19 12:49:00,5204,Great looking pup. Love that vest  thing. Would get Roloff one....but it would be nothing more than a fashion Statement as I dont Hunt.
737929,outllaw,2012-10-19 13:27:00,1232,"funny my best draathar was my wifes shadow. in the field she was a machine. we trialed her in michigan and used her for 2 blinds at st lukes bay. at one time i had 20 burger burners in the 70,s. buying chow 1,000lbs at a time. one thing with gun dogs. there loyal and will give everything they have for you..i work my blk lab every morning including christmas day. ,and yes he curls up on the couch.dogs are kids you dont send to college lol."
737956,SlowPoke,2012-10-19 15:50:00,2984,"Well I won't bother with that debate but such a nice looking dog deserves a name derived from beauty, not from something bloated and awkward looking. If that's what you were shooting for, ""Pacer"" is a nice name."
737958,Billy Bob,2012-10-19 15:56:00,5865," Then, the only thing I can suggest for you is to get a Chocolate Lab and name it SlowPoke Pacer.......  :rofl2:"
738040,SlowPoke,2012-10-19 21:53:00,2984,"We don't have time for a new dog, we brought home a stray we found wandering down the center lane of the highway... We were going to call it Billy Bob but we thought the dog might be insulted."
738051,GBW,2012-10-19 22:06:00,8460,My Sierra is 12 years old now and if I was to name her again it would have been Sequoia
738158,Billy Bob,2012-10-20 11:08:00,5865, Why isn't that a BIG STRONG DEPENDABLE Toyota SUV....  ...I believe that is a good name for a Yellow Lab...
