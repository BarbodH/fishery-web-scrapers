738209,Garry2Rs,2012-10-20 18:03:00,1425,"I have a friend, here in Arizona, who is from San Francisco and remains a huge Giants fan.  She drives back to San Fran in the Spring for preseason, and subscribes to mlb.mlb.com on the computer, to watch every game.  We are fishing buddy's, so as a surprise gift for my friend, I threw together some spare parts with a little TLC to make her a Giant's thyme-rod.  The Giant's team colours are Burnt Orange with Black or White, for home or away.     Grip and reelseat detail.   Tiger Wrap...   This close-up with flash shows more detail...   It still needs a hook keeper and I intend to add a Giant's decal before applying the final coat of finish.  Garry2R's"

It is supposed to cool down a bit for the next week, but after that, we go back into the oven...I'm doing my best to stay hydrated...grin. 2R's"
