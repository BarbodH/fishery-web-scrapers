738269,misfish,2012-10-20 20:59:00,29133,Hi Sam. Hope alls well.
738400,DT10Sam,2012-10-21 02:10:00,480," Hi Misfish,  Thanks for asking and yes things are well I think I am done with travelling around the world for my employment and it is time to be home with family and possibly getting my taxidermy business up and running etc.  I will be working on fish mounts and repo`s this winter and get a web site completed and then have TJ get it on line here and get it working for me etc.  In the meantime I have committed myself to driving tractor trailer for a local company here giving them a hand and do not really want this job to last long maybe just for the winter. I have my boat in storage and my youngest lad here at home is bugging me to get it out so next spring I will be fishing like mad and be able to post reports etc.  I have been checking on the forums here lately as to what has been transpiring and have not really had much time to post so hopefully I will be able to contribute and get back into taking part in some of the fishing G2G`s.  Regards,  Sam"

738469,woodenboater,2012-10-21 13:12:00,2277,"Someone needs to figure out a way to make this carp, the next big thing in dining so it gets fished the hell out. Gov't should also be encouraging enterprising businesses to turn it into fertilizer. Gotta be a big market for that..."

738594,ehg,2012-10-21 23:28:00,2666,"  From what i have read they say it is ""sashimi"" quality meat on silver carp.  They have electrofished and netted much of western Lake Erie and have caught no specimens. Only a 2 Bighead Carp were found 15 yrs. or ago so they haven't taken to Great Lakes at all yet."
