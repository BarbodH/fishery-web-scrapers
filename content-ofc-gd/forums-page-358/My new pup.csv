I took my boy Rudy with me to make sure they got along, and they did.  Here she is....The shelter named her Shirley but I expect I will change it...  Here she is    Relaxing   The shelter named her Shirley, I'm not a fan of that, any suggestions?  Her house mates are Rudy and Sasha  Maureen"
738380,Christopheraaron,2012-10-21 01:19:00,3525,Nice pup! I have a few cats myself!
738384,mercman,2012-10-21 01:27:00,7054,"She is adorable Rudy, Sasha, and ""Trinity""	....R,S,T........"
738395,motv8tr,2012-10-21 01:55:00,2587,"Thanks guys, and Chris K, I have 4 cats as well, she'll meet them in a day or two after she settles in a bit with the dogs...  Maureen"
738398,Donnie,2012-10-21 02:02:00,11,Good on ya for the rescue. She's a great looking dog.
738399,Leecher,2012-10-21 02:08:00,7832,"She's a beauty pup Maureen  Congrats Suggestion for a name and one that comes to mind, looking at the pics is Mandy Cheers TJunkie"
738404,Joey,2012-10-21 02:30:00,9122,What a beauty.  Good on ya for rescuing her.  How about Saabi  or Sammie  or Hurley  Kinda sound like Shirley but with a bit more fun
738423,Twocoda,2012-10-21 07:51:00,4130,Congrates on the rescue!...maybe wait a few days to see her personality ...then try for a name...we went through the whole alphabet when naming our Golden (Zoe) but our American Bulldog was high energy and full of gas so he was named after a high performance exhaust system for motorcycles (Paxton)
738433,outllaw,2012-10-21 10:07:00,1232,"excellent. your heart will give her the best name. takes a special person to adopt.bet she,s a lover"
738435,SlowPoke,2012-10-21 10:09:00,2984,"How about Bayga? When you want them in from the yard you can yell ""Rudy, Bayga come on in"" and the neighbours will think you have you garden vegetables trained."
738436,SlowPoke,2012-10-21 10:15:00,2984," LOL!!! Back in my early riding years I knew a guy that had a couple lap dogs named ""Vance & Hines"""
