Good friends. Some laughs. Despite the morning showers it was even a nice day out. The perch weren't too co-operative, but we still managed a few good feeds.  My sink before the carnage began.   We really need to do this more often."

738673,fishindevil,2012-10-22 11:18:00,6254,well done guys !! looks like it was a blast....a great feed too...
738674,crappieperchhunter,2012-10-22 11:54:00,2582,Like I said the bite has been off this fall in there. And the day didn't start off great with that rain  But the skies cleared and we finally found some perch willing to bite.  The 20 incher eluded us again  ...but as always I enjoyed the day and the company.
