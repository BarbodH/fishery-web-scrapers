738250,Leecher,2012-10-20 20:12:00,7832,"Hey all,  Had this beast in my kitchen window for the past few months    she's grown to an epic size since then   Nothing gets past this WEB   She eats well    Thought I'd share this pic    TJunkie"
738251,chris.brock,2012-10-20 20:16:00,4053,"nice picture  I had a spider build a web over the entrance to my composter, lots of fly traffic there, how smart is that?"
738252,Christopheraaron,2012-10-20 20:21:00,3525, Very.
738253,Leecher,2012-10-20 20:23:00,7832," Thanks Chris!!!  Lots of insects flies by this window... some days she hides and we can't see her but the minute the WEB vibrates, she comes out in full force    Smart cookie if you ask me"
738272,Fisherman,2012-10-20 21:02:00,7201,"Love watching them, especially out of the trailer window in the summer.  Leave a light on inside for a few minutes and the moths are buzzing around, look out for the fanged 8x8 monster.  But, in the trailer, that's whole nuther story."
738273,chris.brock,2012-10-20 21:03:00,4053,very cool  it's amazing the entertainment nature can provide if we pay attention eh?
738289,Leecher,2012-10-20 21:39:00,7832," I find them fascinating but like you said... inside not so much   It truly is Chris     After I posted, went back and she had disappeared     I went outside and checked around the window... no trace    She's gone into hiding     Went back inside and took this opportunity to open the window and spray the web to get a shot    Amazing and fascinating the work they do to create such WEB"
738292,irishfield,2012-10-20 21:47:00,26272,Nah... she was just hiding in the corner of the window and snuck in when you opened it to take that picture! Getting cold out there you know... now you have a house guest for the winter (along with her 300 babies)!
738296,Leecher,2012-10-20 21:52:00,7832," Funny you say that Wayne    Inside the house, we kill on average per week, one or two of a different kind of spider    the ones that look deformed  I'll try and get a video of it when she returns from hiding... I think she's just like a deer or moose hunter... gone to a different area to hunt"
738308,kickingfrog,2012-10-20 22:27:00,8333,"The ""perfect hunter"" can be killed with a tissue."
738326,Leecher,2012-10-20 23:13:00,7832," Guess again Wayne    She came back while I was preparing the taters for supper   As much as I would like to do that Rob, can't seem to bring myself to do it  Why??  Have no clue"
738329,kickingfrog,2012-10-20 23:19:00,8333,"I don't kill them either. If my wife makes a big enough deal about it I'll put it out side. Mostly she'll use a tissue, for the big ones the slipper comes out since I won't kill em.  I don't kill them because they mostly eat things that bite me."
738330,BillM,2012-10-20 23:21:00,17367,"Spiders eat all the other nasty bugs (mosquitos, etc)..  I'll happily let them hang around the front door/windows.  Now, if I could get some bats in the backyard, even better!"
738342,Leecher,2012-10-20 23:38:00,7832," They're a great bug eater that's for sure   I totally agree Bill    If you can get swallows to nest in your back yard, they're great bug eaters too    I had a pair that settled into one of my bird houses I have in the back yard one summer and  they ate tremendously at sun down and never had any issues with skeeters"
738422,Twocoda,2012-10-21 07:41:00,4130,My wife is wondering why i jumped away from the computer screaming like a lil school girl....i guess she just found out im scared of spiders...
738447,Leecher,2012-10-21 11:39:00,7832, Really Dave
