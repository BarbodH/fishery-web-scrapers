737201,trapshooter,2012-10-17 02:06:00,1234,Awesome recap Rob.  It was a blast having you and Jim up to Lac Seul.  We definitely had to work hard for our fish and tough it out through some bad weather.  That's the way Lac Seul works though.. put in your time and you'll get rewarded.  Hope to see you guys again soon.

737810,Moosebunk,2012-10-18 23:15:00,3970,"Solid fish Rob.  Great little road tour in the books for ya.  You're making me think I too gotta visit this legendary Lac Seul place before time is up.  Would prefer to leave the snow out of it while boat fishing tho!!! lol.  Ben reminds me of my buddy James from back in highschool.  James played guitar in our band and wanted to live music and rock & roll.  And so he does still to this today, with his own band, and presently producing and recording 3 of the tracks on Blue Rodeo's next album.  James has played alongside Neil Young, Randy Bachmann, Blue Rodeo, Tragically Hip, Mathew Good, Sam Roberts... and puts out some great stuff out on his own too.  Ben, well, I remember it wasn't that long ago when he wanted to fish and write... and look at that dood fish on now!!!  Pick the right place, find the right time... and presto!!!  Magic happens.  Nice skis!!!"
738612,lookinforwalleye,2012-10-22 00:50:00,4399,"Great repot Rob, Brad and I are going to have to get up there and see Ben hopefully sooner than later!  Note to self not in October!!!"

736624,kickingfrog,2012-10-15 20:28:00,8333,"My brother and I had the chance to fish Lac Seul last week with Ben Beattie. The target was big muskies.  We had a little time to try the rivers but there was not much happening and time was short.   We split the 1600km drive over 2 days and had some snow in the morning when we woke up in White River. I had packed extra washer fluid and the snow brush when I saw the forecast for our week away.     It was the first time I had travelled Hwy 17 between Sault Ste. Marie and I had to take a moment to stop outside Thunder Bay.      View from Terry Fox Monument.   Ben had mentioned seeing some grouse the last few fishless days on the road to the boat launch so my brother brought the 20 gauge and before the boat had got wet Jim had bagged two birds.   On the water and it didn't take long to have a fish on. Although it ended up being a small pike the seal had been broken and it was my turn next.      The next fish was a nice muskie that was so thick that I thought is was 4-5 inches shorter then it actually ended up. My first Lac Seul muskie is a fat 49 inch fish.       About 45 minutes later my brother gets one and while not as big it is a nice healthy fish. 38 inches.     Sometimes you have to put in long hours and suffer for your muskie, this was not the case for us. We both had a muskie in the boat before we had eaten our lunch on the first day. However, they would be our only two muskie of the trip. Sometimes you have to suffer after you get a muskie.      A 14 inch bait and a small looking 11 inch bait, I should have put something in the photo for scale.   My brother got a big pike as well. It was measured but I can't remember exactly what it was, but I'm pretty sure it was 42-43 inches.    We also had an eagle following us in one area.   The second day fishing the spot it was rewarded with a pike that took a little too long to get down deep.    In all we had 4 days on the water and the weather was wet and cold for most of it. We caught just enough pike every day to break-up the 8-10 hours on the water.     I have read Ben's stuff for a few years now and met him last year on the Richter Lake fly-in but this was the first time fishing with him. No doubt he knows his stuff but seeing him in action once the muskie was on the line was really something to see. All business, prepared and calm.  "

736629,Joey,2012-10-15 20:38:00,9122,"Great report and pictures.  Beautiful Musky you got there, and your brother's is a beaut too, as well as his big pike.  Love the shots of the eagle getting the pike.  Thanks for sharing your trip, hopefully one day we can make a trip with Ben aswell"

737069,Handlebarz,2012-10-16 20:39:00,3790,I guess fishing up there in early oct is like late November here in the sw. Beauty ski I love that shot of the eagle taking the pike thanks for sharing.
737076,Spiel,2012-10-16 21:05:00,9065,"Totally speechless Rob.  What a great report, distance travelled, weather traversed to spend time fishing with Ben. You were obviously in good hands! The proof is in the pictures with some impressive fish hauled over the gunnels."
737080,fishnsled,2012-10-16 21:14:00,3520,"Some decent fish for the conditions, those fish all seem to have the feed bag on - thick looking fish. That is worth the price of any guid to get some quality fish like those in the boat. Price of gas wasn't too bad either eh?  Thanks for the report."
737083,Fish Farmer,2012-10-16 21:21:00,2234,"Great report thanks for sharing. Looking at that snow, to early for us down south."

737147,Rich Clemens,2012-10-17 00:01:00,3131,Great report and love the nice fish you guys were rewarded with.   Couple die-hard fishermen.   Congrats guys.
737199,kickingfrog,2012-10-17 02:01:00,8333," Lac Seul usually starts freezing up early in November.  That's my biggest muskie to date and it was so thick I though it was only 44-45 inches before it went on the board.  White River was the highest gas prices anywhere, including Sioux Lookout, by about 4 cents. I haven't added up the receipts yet but I figured a $1.40 per litre when ball parking the gas cost."
