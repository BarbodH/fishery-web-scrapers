738875,Loonietoon,2012-10-23 00:33:00,1450,Well she was diagnosed about 1.1/2 years ago with this and we had her on meds and the said about a month ago she was doing great. then 2 weeks ago she did not want to eat much then started walking like she was drunk (hell thats my job) then stopped taking her pills and throwing up. We knew then it was time. Got her cremated and put in a urn and my daughter knows when I go she is to be put with her mother & me when they open it up.
738885,Rich Clemens,2012-10-23 01:10:00,3131,Exactly what we did with my little girl.  Had her creamated and she sits in our curio.  Patsy and the kids know that she goes with me.  That's why I keep her in my avitar
