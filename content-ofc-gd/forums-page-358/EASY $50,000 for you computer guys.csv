738684,jedimaster,2012-10-22 12:46:00,3472,"I don't mean to say that all are run by the mob, but lots of the illegal ones are.  there was a show on tv the other day about how Canada is viewed as a refuge for Italian mafia king pins. I think I recognized a few ex coworkers. Haha"
738692,Headhunter,2012-10-22 13:25:00,5703,"Here's what happens to telemarketing calls in my house... TM - hello, Mr. HH? Me- yup, what's up? TM - I' calling from... Me-  can you hold for a second? TM - sure... Me - hand the phone to my 9 year old daughter and tell her to talk to them about her Pokeman game... TM - still holding for ten minutes... Me - hang up when daughter done her story!  I had a security company call recently... let them babble away until I said ""I recently upgraded my home security and I went and installed the BFD system."" ""What's the BFD system sir, never heard of it"" was the response. ""Big Ass Dog"" was my answer... they haven't called back. HH"
738726,fishnsled,2012-10-22 15:07:00,3520,"I was visiting my grandfather at the nursing home last week when he received a call. He was getting incredibly frustrated so I asked him to give me the phone. I told them that I was speaking on behalf of my grandfather who was in a nursing home and not mentally fit to make any decisions. (the truth) They apologized several times and said that they would never call back again without me ever asking them not to call again. lol! First time that's ever happened.  I personally screen all my calls and if it's a not a name or number that I recognize, I just don't answer. If it's important they'll leave a message. Started doing that when I was going through my divorce..."

Try it some time  . We don't answer any calls  that we don't recgonize  , instead we let the machine take them and we screen them later when its conveniant ."

738640,jedimaster,2012-10-22 02:19:00,3472," Did you work for one that was making legal calls... or the illegal ones... trust me on this the people slinging viagra over email, making calls outside of the bounds of whats considered legal are not run by your friendly neighborhood good doer. Alot of what you see around you on a daily basis has mob and gang ties."
