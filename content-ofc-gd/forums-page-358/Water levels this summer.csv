738452,xKobeZx,2012-10-21 12:12:00,10,Someone pulled Hamilton harbours plug I fish it every week and its down more and more each time im there.
738466,b2kptbo,2012-10-21 13:01:00,1505,"Pulled my boat from the cottage mid-August and still had trouble getting it on the trailer at the public launch. From what I hear there are some boats trapped on the lake, some in the mud, need some more rain too help them out. This year has been the lowest I've seen on that lake ever, hate to say but I think a good winter snowfall will be needed..."
738468,manitoubass2,2012-10-21 13:10:00,11391,"Down a good 6ft here on the Rainy River, and held that way almost all summer.  It's normally high in the spring (it was this year too), then it drops drastically, then goes back up, then down, then way up in the fall before freeze up.  Right now were at a 2.5ft average where it should be about 8ft average. If it stays this low, freeze up should be quick, but I'll be looking for new icefishing spots for sure.  Oh, and because it has held this low for so long, water visibility is almost the clearest I've ever seen it"
738497,GBW,2012-10-21 15:34:00,8460,in the past 12 years the lake my folks live on has seen 'beach' two times in those years and this year was one of them  the last time was 12 years ago.  they have a stone wall that has water hitting it all season but not this year.
738512,4x4bassin,2012-10-21 16:30:00,1025,"All the lakes I fished this summer were down at least a foot , we also have a cottage just east of Wasaga and I have never seen the water levels this low in G-Bay . I can now walk out to some rocks that I ""use"" to catch smallmouths from 35 years ago without even getting wet and some of my old smallie rocks are 20 feet high and dry"
738516,Jer,2012-10-21 16:37:00,1426,"One of the benefits of being on one of the Trent Severn lakes is fairly consistent levels all season long, usually to the detriment of the surrounding watersheds, especially in a dry year as this one was."
738525,captpierre,2012-10-21 17:30:00,2521,"Ya.  I feel guilty that our cottage lake (Pigeon) is so stable, at the expense of folks in Haliburton."
738552,Fisherman,2012-10-21 19:48:00,7201,"If Huron/GB get much lower, I'll be able to drive from Meaford to Owen Sound along the shoreline.  It's just nuts how much it's gone down.  Where we used to go for a wash in the summer by some 7' high boulders, they are now dry.  That's a lot of water gone somewhere."
738245,captpierre,2012-10-20 19:47:00,2521,Hey Everybody.  Just interested.  How were water levels this year on your favourite bodies of water?  Pigeon Lake was down a bit but not much.  A buddy of mine was fishing the Ganaraska pier last week and said Lake O is down 3 ft for sure  peter
738248,spinnerbaitking,2012-10-20 20:05:00,1622,Most of the small lakes around here are down 12 to 18in. this year Tight Lines SBK
738327,Joeytier,2012-10-20 23:18:00,3990,"Summer levels were fairly average, and most lakes are now at or over their high water mark (central/northeastern ontario).  The lakes seem to be in great shape for the freeze-up"
738333,BillM,2012-10-20 23:24:00,17367,Big lake I fished up north was up probably 1.5ft at least.
738335,Andrew Grant,2012-10-20 23:29:00,201,.
738336,ctranter,2012-10-20 23:29:00,543,"The lake my cottage is on was at the lowest I've ever seen in my lifetime. It's not a big or deep lake, but I think it was down about 2.5 feet. The water level marks on the rocks were really quite shocking.  Good thing we built a new floating dock and pooched the old crib style one... that would have been hell to get levelled."
738339,davey buoy,2012-10-20 23:36:00,5505, Or more I'd say. Terrible.
738341,mercman,2012-10-20 23:38:00,7054,"In the St Lawerence, below the Hydro and control Dams, water was down 3-4 feet.Many of the local launches had to add up to 100 feet of dock to access to water deep enough for docking.They even narrowed the shipping channel to keep ships from running aground."
738350,Christopheraaron,2012-10-20 23:52:00,3525,you all saw bronte.
738351,danbouck,2012-10-20 23:56:00,4380,"Long Point Bay is down about 4 feet. There is 10"" of water in my boathouse at the back and the first 6'  is dirt"
738352,i2cool2fool,2012-10-21 00:02:00,349,The water levels are crazy low this year. Wildwood shutdown t the end of August this year.
738355,Leecher,2012-10-21 00:13:00,7832,"The local ponds I fish were quite low this summer but with all the rain we got lately, I'm fairly sure their up to par now Bring on hard water now"
738359,SlowPoke,2012-10-21 00:25:00,2984,Mangled a prop at Wildwood Two prop hits on Lake St Clair (same rock twice lol) Dredged the mud at Ashbridges Bay West Arm is usually a mine field but never had an issue!  I'm afraid next year won't be any better.
738360,irishfield,2012-10-21 00:32:00,26272," Well it is.. and it isn't. It dropped almost 2 feet in the last month from where it was. That said, when my wife was about 6 years old they had over 200 feet of front lawn on Sturgeon Bay in the early 70's. When I first went there in 1981 they had about 70 feet of front lawn. It's ALMOST back to where it was this year.. some 31 years later."
738361,Terry,2012-10-21 00:33:00,14456,the north end of the lake is down about 2 ft  south end down about 2.5 ft      .
738369,Whopper,2012-10-21 00:52:00,2174,"Walleye opener in NWO lake (Little Vermilion) was down at least a foot, prevent us from fishing some normal spots. Lake Erie down and the two weekends I got to go a south wind sucked the water down even more made getting out of the harbor a real chore. Local lake in Central Ohio isn't deep to begin with and it was down a foot and a half, the prop business in the area was booming."
738371,Live2fish85,2012-10-21 00:56:00,1633,"I have noticed Lake Ontario and Lake Erie are really low. My parents breakwall usually has the water about a foot up it, this year there has been about 10' of beach. The spots I fish on Lake Ontario are down about 2.5' I would say."
738376,hotsky,2012-10-21 01:16:00,400,Just came from the harbour in hamilton water is waay lower than it was last summer id say 5 feet less.
738378,Dave Bailey,2012-10-21 01:19:00,1641,"Frenchman Bay is down a bit in the past couple of weeks, maybe a foot."
738381,Live2fish85,2012-10-21 01:20:00,1633, Unless it has gone down about 2' since last week maybe. When I was there it was down about 3'.
738396,SirCranksalot,2012-10-21 01:57:00,3291," Actually, just around a foot. See here:http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/now/wlevels/dbd/  Bear in mind that with strong winds the level at a particular location can fluctuate a foot or more. I see this happen quite a bit here in Wasaga. See here: http://www.waterlevels.gc.ca/C&A/Graphs/collingwood.htm"
738406,mike rousseau,2012-10-21 02:48:00,4661, Not here.... Below your dam maybe....
738414,Toad Hunter,2012-10-21 03:43:00,261,has anyone driven past Guelph Lake this past summer ?? It looked almost ready for development
738418,northernpike56,2012-10-21 04:44:00,717,"I have a few secret ponds that tend to be good indicators of water levels. One of them, which is fed by a creek (not spring), was nearly completely dry. I went there in sept to check it out, and saw several panfish and bass rotting in the mud. That really upset me. my other pond (spring fed) is about 8 to 12 inches too low. same with the creek that feeds it. I only got 1 brown trout in it this year just before closer, but the bass and pannys are still biting in the pond"
738440,Rich,2012-10-21 10:41:00,3927,Water is so low its ridiculous!
