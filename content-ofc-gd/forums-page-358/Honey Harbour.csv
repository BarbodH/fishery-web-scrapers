738206,Dan668,2012-10-20 17:38:00,1120,"Want to get out Sunday, will 25km west winds affect this area? Not sure whether it's worth the trip. Seems pretty sheltered"
738260,Dan668,2012-10-20 20:43:00,1120,Any input? 45km gusts now. Looks like I'll be staying home
738407,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-21 02:48:00,196,"   Thanks for the heads up on the weather. I was planning on fishing there tomorrow as well but with the winds blowing as strong as they are I'll be staying home too!!  Too bad, it would have been good to see a fellow board member on the water...."
738408,Dan668,2012-10-21 02:53:00,1120,I still may go. 50:50 lol
738410,irishfield,2012-10-21 02:55:00,26272," 30K out of the West... LOTS of water to fish in there in that, especially considering you're launching in sheltered and not crossing the main Sound."
738413,Dan668,2012-10-21 03:23:00,1120, We've decided to go. If you end up going I'll be in a Lund impact with a few guys. Say hi.
738449,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-21 11:55:00,196,  I'm still deciding whether to go or not.  I just checked the Weather Network  and it says west winds at 26 km/h.  If I do go I'll be out in a blue Lund Explorer 1675.
738450,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-21 11:56:00,196,  I'm still deciding whether to go or not.  I just checked the Weather Network  and it says west winds at 26 km/h.  If I do go I'll be out in a blue Lund Explorer 1675.
738666,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-22 10:06:00,196,  Any report on how the fishing was? I ended up not going. Can you let me in on what I missed out on? How bad was it out on the water with the 25-27 km/h winds?
738790,Dan668,2012-10-22 19:26:00,1120,"Was pretty good. Not crazy numbers. But it was a day out none the less. Took two of the smaller pike home. A lot of hammer handles, biggest being 33"". A few nice lm biggest being 3 lb. A few dink sm, I've tried numerous spots but can't seem to find the bigger ones. Water wasn't as bad as I thought, although this was the first time I fully drained my group 31s on my terrova."
729911,Dan668,2012-09-15 02:12:00,1120,"Never fished it before, but deciding to go here or the kawarthas tomorrow morning. Have charts. I had fished port severn (little lake), last week, was ok. The marine forecasts that apply to georgian bay cover this area? They say strong wind warning but the area is slightly enclosed, just making sure it will be fishable. Thanks"
729974,Billy Bob,2012-09-15 13:57:00,5865,Very pretty area.......GOOD LUCK  Bob
730015,Rich Nelson,2012-09-15 19:07:00,332,Hope you dont like your current prop..... be careful
730016,Dan668,2012-09-15 19:09:00,1120,"I just bought a new prop too lol. Went to the kawarthas instead, slow day for most I talked to including myself"
730034,Billy Bob,2012-09-15 22:37:00,5865,Damn.....not good........Honey Harbor is under utilized as far as fishing IMHO....
730051,bigbuck,2012-09-15 23:28:00,2449,Sssssshhhhhh billy bob! All the more fish for me. I'm hoping to hit the water for skis in the next coupla weeks.
730117,F7Firecat,2012-09-16 02:12:00,347,boats and citidiots r gone i kinda like HH in the fall........
730225,bigbuck,2012-09-16 18:21:00,2449,It is nice in the fall. Most of the spots I fish except for a couple there is next to nobody around. I might see 1 or 2 boats fishing for 'skis during the week.
730231,Dan668,2012-09-16 18:43:00,1120,"Would navionics be ok for that area, realized my chart isn't for that section. Looking to fish that area next week"
730241,Rich Nelson,2012-09-16 19:12:00,332,"Navionics is ""ok"". Cant trust it 100% though. Just use caution."
730270,irishfield,2012-09-16 21:43:00,26272,"Keep in mind that GPS is generally off by about a 25 foot position error... when trolling 5 mph and zigging and zagging(it's come along way since it originally was 500). Location awareness is key on Georgian Bay at ALL times. Being off by 5 feet can make the difference between the perfect structure troll-by or the perfect strucTURAL impact. I've been boating GBay since 1981 and can still find rocks. Andy's on it about 3 times a week all season long, and for as many years, running the same 40+ mile trolling runs and even he sacrificed a lower unit on his 225 to the cause 2 years ago.  I run Navionics on the Lowrance 112C AND have the paper chart book turned to the correct page at all times. There are also unmarked / uncharted single rocks in the middle of wide open areas of otherwise perfect water, so don't get cocky and just think you can motor on plane to get somewhere when you're out of the marked channel.  Read the charts.. highlight or keep a mental note of questionable areas and proceed with caution at all time. Most of all have fun... and have a back up plan to get in if needed."
730281,Dan668,2012-09-16 22:08:00,1120,Thanks for your insight guys. The fed pub maps good? Only thing I don't like is that their not water proof
730282,irishfield,2012-09-16 22:10:00,26272, Get a couple of the 3x or 4x ziplock bags from Walmart for the charts.
734948,Dan668,2012-10-07 01:14:00,1120,What marina is good to launch from in the area? Might try it tomorrow
734949,F7Firecat,2012-10-07 01:26:00,347,"Village Marina will do you good right in Honey, pretty much follow HH road right to the end on the right cant miss it big long narrow parking lot"
734972,Dan668,2012-10-07 02:21:00,1120,Alright. Thanks
735000,irishfield,2012-10-07 04:21:00,26272,You've got one thing going for you... the water level has dropped almost 2' in 2 weeks! Like someone pulled the plug out of a bath tub! Many of the rocks that just lurked below the surface or now proudly showing themselves!
735066,bigbuck,2012-10-07 19:41:00,2449,"CAREFUL navigating!! Stick to North Bay and South Bay just down the way. All the fish you want to catch are in there, you just need to find them, its plenty of water to work."
735067,Dan668,2012-10-07 19:49:00,1120,"I was in north and south bay. Was enough water to cover for my first time on gbay. South bay we managed tons of largemouth. A few in 3-4lb range. 5 pike for the day, biggest being 8lbs. North bay was pretty unproductive. Didn't mark many fish either. Tried out my new musky rod for a bit, ti xh 9'. Awesome rod for throwing double tens. Really nice area. I'll definitely be back."
735080,bigbuck,2012-10-07 21:28:00,2449,Nice!!
735083,SirCranksalot,2012-10-07 21:48:00,3291,  You can buy waterproof versions of the small boat charts----just cost a bit more.
735085,Dan668,2012-10-07 21:52:00,1120,"Good to know, I already purchased the full fed map version. Nice charts. That and avionics made navigation simple. Oh and the low water levels."
735113,Sour_Squirrel,2012-10-08 00:55:00,196,  Where (which marina) did you launch your boat from? What did they charge for the use of their launch ramp and parking for the day?
735115,Dan668,2012-10-08 01:08:00,1120,Village Marine. 20 bucks
735181,waso,2012-10-08 13:29:00,44,"There is a public launch straight down from village marina (just drive past village straight to the water). Then park at Joe's parking back beside the town centre.  Bit of a walk but only cost $10 total. If you have a partner just get him to drive around to pick you up at the town dock. A little time consuming but saves money, did it for a couple years."
