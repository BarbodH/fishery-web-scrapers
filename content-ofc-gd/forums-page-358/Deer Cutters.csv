738762,jedimaster,2012-10-22 17:23:00,3472,Its not so hard to butcher a deer yourself. I have been doing all of our camps deer for the last 4 or 5 years now. Its pretty easy once you figure out where the bones are. Lots of good how to videos on youtube.
738775,BITEME,2012-10-22 18:28:00,1968," yeah we attempted 2 last year with ""a knowlegable mentor"" turned out to be a large disaster, and a waste i found it quite upsetting and not befitting of the animals"
738793,jedimaster,2012-10-22 19:33:00,3472,How did you guys do it? Hanging or on a table/ground? I find butchering it while hanging upside down is much easier. This is a pretty good video and is roughly how I do mine. Its hard to find a butcher that will go through all the extra hastsle of butchering wild game.
