738143,Toad Hunter,2012-10-20 03:56:00,261,"With the recent posts about the Michigan monster caught, I got a little curious... a buddy of mine caught this a few years back on the upper french right off his dock (near the old Keystone lodge area) and he told me it was 58"" and cant remember if he ever told me a girth (but his measuring device is questionable) - anyways curious what all the expert skiers on here, might think it could have weighed. (roughly obviously)  "
738144,Toad Hunter,2012-10-20 03:58:00,261,I should also add it went back in the drink
738146,chris.brock,2012-10-20 04:13:00,4053,"I wouldn't consider myself an expert skier, but I'd guess it wasn't quite 58"", if your buddy is average height, I would say the fish weighs about 30 lbs"
738147,ProFishermanJones,2012-10-20 04:13:00,77,"28-35 lbs.  fish looks to have a 20 to lets say a 22"" girth?  With calculations. length 	girth 58    x      20= 29lbs 58    x      21= 31.97lbs 58    x      22= 35.09lbs"
738148,Roy,2012-10-20 04:20:00,13728,I'll be kind and say it's a 50.  Nice fish all the same.
738161,Gregoire,2012-10-20 11:48:00,1397,My buddy caught a 52 this year that looks to be about the same size of that fish. I would guess the fish is between 25-30 lbs and 48-52 inches.
738162,TroutnMuskieHunter,2012-10-20 11:49:00,1362, I'd have to agree with Roy..
738163,outllaw,2012-10-20 11:55:00,1232,nice ski. as we all have seen pictures can be controvesial. and then theres the internet expert opinions lol.. it was relesed thats a great thing.
738172,glen,2012-10-20 13:28:00,2641,Nice fish.  Unlike some pics this pic gives us a little info about the size.  The way your friends hand is spread out you can see the depth.  Call it a 30lber.
738180,kickingfrog,2012-10-20 14:11:00,8333,"The span of the guy's hand should give some indication as to girth, and length for that matter. That's why I try to hind my hands when taking photos of my ""massive"" fish.  Nice fish."
738198,4x4bassin,2012-10-20 16:23:00,1025,"I would say around 35 lbs as well , nice musky and congrats to your buddy on getting her back into the bay"
738202,OhioFisherman,2012-10-20 16:37:00,6623,It`s a lot bigger than any bass I ever caught! Honest!

738205,linweir,2012-10-20 17:31:00,202,Very nice ski. I will say it's about 34 pd.
738307,fishindevil,2012-10-20 22:25:00,6254,Looks like 48inches 28-30lbs the fish sure doesn't look 58 to me !!! But hey if he measured it so be it right
738310,Toad Hunter,2012-10-20 22:40:00,261,"  I would say he's around 5'8 or so (almost a hobit)  I appreciate all the feed back, I only ask because I have always doubted and questioned his ""58"" myself too. (we have debated it for nearly 3 years). But if he thinks that's what 58""s looks like, this now explains why he's always bragging about a ""10 inch"" ""botttom feeder"" (whatever that means )"

738354,SirWhite,2012-10-21 00:10:00,210,"If he is 68"" tall the fish would have to be under a foot shorter than the man. Doesn't look to be the case. Nice fish. I'd still say itd weigh 30lbs, which is 25lbs heavier than my pb big tooth."
738357,Toad Hunter,2012-10-21 00:24:00,261,"  I'm not much taller myself, I just mean he's no 6'er"
