After loosing what would have been my first 4 browns yesterday and one this morning i got back out there this afternoon and gave it another go and was rewarded with a beauty!! God dang this are pretty fish it!!!  After releasing the brown i left just in time to beat the intense rainshower   All in all a great day, landed a nice nook and a jack, and saw a nice deer walk right by me while i was fishin! "

737734,fishnsled,2012-10-18 20:08:00,3520,  Looks like a lamprey mark to me.
737735,Christopheraaron,2012-10-18 20:09:00,3525, That's really the only thing it could be.
737742,mikeseb,2012-10-18 20:25:00,201," it was a gross lamprey mark, damn i hate seeing those on fish!  I cant wait for the spring when some more of them come up the creeks and I can kill them  sorry about the mud on the salmon There was nowhere else to land it, the fish was only out of the water for 30 seconds max.
