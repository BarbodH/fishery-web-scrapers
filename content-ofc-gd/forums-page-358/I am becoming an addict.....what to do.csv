I have gone my whole life slamming lakers, pike, eyes, and Bass but with a move to kitchhener a year ago from Barrie this became allot more difficult .   When I first started riverfishingni got skunked 10 times in a row.  I finally got them dialed in last spring.   anyways sorry for the kitchen sink pic.  But I headed to river A last night and went 2/3 in the pitch black what a blast.  Float fishing in the dark is exciting.    I kept this one. I rarely do but my gf. Said if I'm going fishin I better bring home dinner.  From what I understand it only gets better from here...bring on the cold"
