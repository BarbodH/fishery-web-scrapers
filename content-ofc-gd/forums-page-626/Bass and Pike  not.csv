508743,Terry,2010-10-02 23:12:00,14456,"Bass and Pike  report.. Last weekend I went out for some bass and pike but I just couldn't get them to bite  had a couple of small bites so I down sized and started getting big jumbo perch  one had a live minnow in it's mouth so I used it for bait, the thing would barely hit the water and they were all over it, till I lost it  I had a small 2' plastic minnow on a small jig and again they were slamming it. A couple of them were not able to release so I figured I would keep a meal of them..  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3984.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3984.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>    so today I woke up and the wind was down,,even thought the weather reports called for high winds I grabbed my new underwater camera ( the aquava fish camera died the rest of the unit was fine) so I got a different kind of camera and MacGyvered it to work with the aqua vu  I went back to the same spot as last weekend and they were on again  not the big jumbos, but still jumbos or close to them  the HDS 5 was marking lots of fish   <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3988.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3988.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>   here are some  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3987.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3987.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>    <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3985.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3985.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>  <a href=""http://s25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/?action=view&current=DSCF3990.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c52/Mrbeee1954/DSCF3990.jpg"" border=""0"" alt=""Photobucket""></a>   here are some videos   <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2OC85fs-cQ?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2OC85fs-cQ?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2OC85fs-cQ?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""480"" height=""385""></embed></object>  <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmDoTFC-ShE?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmDoTFC-ShE?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmDoTFC-ShE?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""480"" height=""385""></embed></object>  <object width=""480"" height=""385""><param name=""movie"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YZGkuByS8M?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param'>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YZGkuByS8M?fs=1&hl=en_US""></param><param name=""allowFullScreen"" value=""true""></param><param name=""allowscriptaccess"" value=""always""></param><embed src=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YZGkuByS8M?fs=1&hl=en_US"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" allowscriptaccess=""always"" allowfullscreen=""true"" width=""480"" height=""385""></embed></object>"
508749,Rod Caster,2010-10-02 23:24:00,5784,Those perch look like easy pickings for a pike. I'm suprised you didn't see a pike after all that commotion in the water.  If there was a tv channel dedicated to underwater fish cameras I would watch it 24/7  
508752,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-10-02 23:38:00,0,that definitely looks like fun... just wished I have a boat.
508762,misfish,2010-10-03 00:02:00,29133,Nice yellows bud. Better then where I was today.Yep work.
508772,Joey,2010-10-03 01:11:00,9122,"Good job Terry.  Almost makes me wish I was ice fishing     Okay, not yet but soon  Joey"
508773,Skud,2010-10-03 01:16:00,739,Thanks for the report Terry. i will be out on cooks bay Sunday afternoon(tomorrow) looking for pike and perch
508782,skeeter,2010-10-03 02:00:00,1907,aqua vu??  i thought you had a marcum camera ?
508784,Terry,2010-10-03 02:04:00,14456,21 ft was where I found the bigger perch  but pike were not nice to me this weekend   yeah I do have a marcum which replaced the broken aqua uv   I saw a good deal on ebay for just a camera and wanted to see if it would work  so now I guess I have 2  one for each hole   ice fishing hole that is

508975,SBCregal,2010-10-04 00:48:00,688,"we were down at the barrie waterfront for a hr or two this afternoon.  plenty of dinks, nothing worth keeping.  too bad, i was hoping for a feed. mmmmmmmmm"
508977,Rod Caster,2010-10-04 00:53:00,5784,  We were just down there this evening. I kept 6 and fed the seagulls a bunch of gobies. Nothing real big but we'll get one good meal for two from the 6 fish.
