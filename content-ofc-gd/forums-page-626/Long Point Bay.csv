508213,Flappn,2010-09-30 16:41:00,245,Sorry I am with HTHM on this one. $20 bucks is crazy.....end of story. Innisfil is $25. The way rates go up these days across the board...it wont be staying $20 or $25 for long. I didn't or don't use Innisfil out of spite. That's an hour of work for me...to slip a boat in the water. Keep using those launches people and nothing will change...then again it's the Canadian way. $10 is reasonable... $20 is not right. Good way to turn away tourists.
508215,fish_fishburn,2010-09-30 16:44:00,1311,"Most of the launches around here are free. The odd private one charges 5.00, which I think is reasonable. I guess if you want to live in southern Ontario you have to pay to play."
508219,HTHM,2010-09-30 16:51:00,4082,"Exactly what I said to the marina operators. As well, it is the off season now if I am not mistaken. If I don't want to go in the fall, would I want to go in the summer?"
508221,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-09-30 16:53:00,1107,I think the main problem is the north shore launches on LPB are trailer parks first marina's second they make more off of seasonal trailer/slip renters than the weekend warrior so they raise the price if you still come and pay than it's a bonus for them if you choose to drive around the point to the $10 launches it doesn't effect there business all that much.
508355,ch312,2010-09-30 23:36:00,1590,"old cut is my #1 choice coming from brantford. i refuse to pay $20 for the ""wear and tear"" my dakota and a 14ft tinner are going to do on the concrete ramp. what makes it worse is im already spending another $20 in their store on snacks and minnows most of the time. so, ill gladly drive by them to get to old cut and launch for $10. they are actually fair priced so i kinda feel obligated to give my money to honest people rather than greedy..."
508360,scugpg,2010-09-30 23:52:00,1373," I totally agree. I took my boat to a small lake outside of town that only had one launch. It was 6:30 at night and they charged me $12 to launch.  Worst part is that it was terrible fishing. Never going back.  Its sad but true....if people will pay, owners will charge."
508029,HTHM,2010-09-30 00:41:00,4082,"I WAS going to go perching in LPB this afternoon, drove down from Hamilton, stopped at HWY 6 & 24 to pick up minnows, went to Port ryerse to launch, and some ass has dug up the launch and put armour stone in front of it. So much for that launch..... I head down the road and every marina and launch point that I found wanted $20 for me to launch. It will be a h-e-double toothpicks of a long time before i dasrken those doorways again. So I pooped away a day that should have been fun on the principle that i will not be gouged, on the bright side i did see some nice country. Oh BTW, if you think I was being stubborn, yes I was, but i am not going to get ""robertson'ed"" by a marina owner either."
508030,danbouck,2010-09-30 00:46:00,4380,I could have told you where to launch!  You are just upset because you couldn't take the boat that you wanted to
508032,HTHM,2010-09-30 00:48:00,4082,Couldn't find your phone number and my raspberry was dead.
508033,danbouck,2010-09-30 00:49:00,4380, i c
508041,vinnimon,2010-09-30 00:58:00,2593,"Albert, didnt Dan say something to the effect of,Not Yet!LOL"
508049,smally21,2010-09-30 01:12:00,993,i pay my 20$ but dan b. if you know something i dont......
508050,danbouck,2010-09-30 01:13:00,4380, Old Cut is $10 and puts you close to most of the good fishing spots.
508053,BiggFish,2010-09-30 01:14:00,40,Likely could have caught 6-8 lbs of perch if you would have launched... last time I checked perch is about $9-$11 a lb?  Food for thought...
508055,HTHM,2010-09-30 01:17:00,4082,I would rather have had food for belly. And I still think it is outrageous to pay $20 in order to launch a 14' boat.
508059,smally21,2010-09-30 01:22:00,993,thanks dan - i might be incorrect about this but when i come in from the east i find it quicker to drive the boat across from turkey point then it is to drive the truck around to the old cut.  if i come down thru simcoe way it makes sense to go to the old cut i suppose.  it could just be id rather be in the boat than the truck.  i think the boat uses less gas too on the same drive.  by the way by old cut you do mean in longpoint dont you?
508060,BiggFish,2010-09-30 01:22:00,40,"Hey HTHM,  I agree 100%.  In Long point I know of three launches which is all of them to my knowledge that are all $10.  Also I think Port Rowan is $12 or something?  Where were you trying to launch?  Chad"
508063,HTHM,2010-09-30 01:27:00,4082,From Port Ryerse to Akers marina along Front road.
508065,solopaddler,2010-09-30 01:31:00,8605,Your precious time on the water is worth a lot more than $20.  You should have paid it and gone and had your fun.
508069,smally21,2010-09-30 01:39:00,993,"if i get tired of the 20$ i just bring a guy with me. if he doesn't offer up the 20$ when we get to the marina i bring someone else next time!!!  but seriously its the cost of the travelling fisherman.  look at it this way - you could pay 1500$ for a slip and fish the same water day in day out, or go rogue and fish new water all the time. 1500/20 = ??? i dunno alot of ramp fees!!!!"
508070,Joey,2010-09-30 01:39:00,9122," Yup, I agree, not everything is about money.  Time is definately more valuable!"
508078,danbouck,2010-09-30 01:52:00,4380,Docks cost as little as $475/yr down there  And yes old cut on the point
508097,kickingfrog,2010-09-30 02:22:00,8333,"Ramp fees are completely arbitrary, and are based on what the owners think the market will bare. If enough people don't use a ramp that they feel is charging too much the price may change.  I got hit a one once, it was $10 in and $10 out. Didn't know about the second $10 until we were loading up.  I go down the road now."
508105,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-30 02:36:00,2690,"Old Cut isn't too much further and yes is only $10...Inner Bay Marina is $15.  Both under $20, yeah, $20 is outrageous for a launch fee, but, as stated earlier perch is pretty darn expensive in the grocery store as well.  Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet, life is too short."
508108,HTHM,2010-09-30 02:52:00,4082,"I can relate to all of the sentiments expressed, however when one's back is up and a certain level of outrage is attained, anyone can be a stubborn as a mule.....esp me."
508112,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-30 03:00:00,2050,"yeah $20.00 was a bit of a shocker for me when I first moved down here.  Growing up in Sudbury most launches were FREE or $5.00 at the most.  I had originally planned to get a season pass somewhere but I only have a 15 foot jon boat so my launching location on the bay depends on which way the wind is blowing.  Most of the time I launch at Old cut if I can because it's only 10 bucks, but I often launch at Akers because he's about 1 km from my wife's grandmothers house.... that gives me a few extra minutes on the water which is worth the 5 bucks to me.  Bottom line is I don't have a choice so I just grin an bear it and get out fishing as much as I can afford to!  Cheers, Ryan"
508124,ctdd2006,2010-09-30 04:56:00,531, Amen!
508157,bow slayer,2010-09-30 13:34:00,1074,next time pay your 11 bucks and use the ramp in the PP.
508162,Billy Bob,2010-09-30 13:51:00,5865,"I totally agree....$20 is REALLY gouging and so is $10 IMHO....  Here I think $7 is steep and $5 is somewhat reasonable....most of my launching sites are FREE (my favorite four letter word).  2 years ago I went to Otisco Lake the day before the walleye opener with my 2 sons to check out the lake....the marina owner wanted $9 to launch. I told him that's too much as everyone else is charging $7....he took the $7 and the next day we went to Oneida Lake where there was a FREE launch and caught several walleye, pickerel and perch. The marina owner on Otisco Lake will NEVER see another dime of my money and by the looks of his business he needs every dime he can mustard up.  Bob"
508186,west lake charlie,2010-09-30 15:23:00,40,"As long as its a quality launch, ez in and ez out. I only have a 2wd. I'll pay the extra money. Ive been at a few that I definatly wore $20 off my rear tires."
508200,Billy Bob,2010-09-30 16:02:00,5865,"One other thought that always drives me crazy with these launch fees.....Take Dunkirk Harbor in Dunkirk, NY....they have a very large pier there and two boat launches connected to the pier...they received federal money to improve the boat launch MANY years ago.....the pier I am not sure who paid for that but it's been there forever so I am guessing a LOT of federal aid paid for it if not all of it as it's part of the harbor and the city would never been able to afford it.  For boat launchers it's a $7 fee.....for those who park on the pier and fish off of it, it's FREE.......why do I have to pay to launch while every Tom, Dick and Harry can fish off the pier for free ?  ?  ?  This example can be applied to many other launch areas.  Bob"
