I have an older Navionics Gold, it doesn't have the extra ground contact, I usually have to re-insert the card drawer everytime I turn the unit on to get it to read it...Today she no work at all..."
508731,Leecher,2010-10-02 22:29:00,7832,"SD cards have gold plated contacts, try using a pencil eraser and lightly rubbing the contacts to remove the ionize buildup, then re-seat the card and see if your Lowrance will read it  Leechman"
508740,Pigeontroller,2010-10-02 23:01:00,2793,Tried that...
508745,ld17,2010-10-02 23:12:00,319,I would try the card in another unit and see if it works.  Then you will know if it's the card or your unit.  If it is the card I would talk to a navionics rep and see about getting the card replaced.  I think they would do if for free or a small fee.
508766,Pigeontroller,2010-10-03 00:41:00,2793,Good thinking! I'll try it in my bow unit...

I had been tinkering with the settings tho, just the sensitivity but I had re-set the unit back to factory default forgetting I had the SD in and had to re calibrate the unit to recognize the chip.  ....maybe?"
508865,Pigeontroller,2010-10-03 14:45:00,2793,Worth a try...
508870,Pigeontroller,2010-10-03 15:43:00,2793,"Nope, that didn't work...Starting to thick the card is kaput!"
