507936,bigugli,2010-09-29 16:34:00,6138,have not had any fishing to report lately. Been too busy with the joys of the harvest. Time to can some of that summer warmth    I'm still picking a bushel a week of the jalapenos. Nother few weeks and they'l pull all the tomatoes in the hoop houses. Can you say pickled green tomatoes?
507947,Rod Caster,2010-09-29 17:12:00,5784,DAMN! Those jalapenos look divine. Jalapenos are way better than the orange/yellow hot peppers. Do you grow then outdoors? Do they need a specific climate?

508096,Leecher,2010-09-30 02:22:00,7832,Great stuff Bruce Sounds like the harvest is keeping you off the shoreline these days Love the label on the salsa jars Thanks for sharing!!! Jacques
508282,crappieperchhunter,2010-09-30 19:47:00,2582,Bruce is this year batch of salsa as good as last years.  The jars you shared with me last fall where as good as any salsa I have had anywhere  Anybody who has not tried it is missing out.  I got the empty jars all ready to return to you on Sunday.
508330,bigugli,2010-09-30 22:44:00,6138,"I'm certain I will not disappoint you. Was that medium, hot, or ?????"
508345,crappieperchhunter,2010-09-30 23:17:00,2582, I think it was medium...had just a little bit of bite to it. I can't tolerate a lot of heat so whatever it was...it was perfect.
508386,SBCregal,2010-10-01 00:57:00,688,do you sell the salsa at a farmers market or something?
508467,bigugli,2010-10-01 09:39:00,6138,I'm up at St Jakobs most Saturdays til the snow flies. A good friend has run a farm stall there for the past 20 years. We have a hoot.
508548,SBCregal,2010-10-01 18:21:00,688,"excellent, we'll definitely try to get up there.  working every other saturday makes it difficult sometimes, but we'll do our best."
