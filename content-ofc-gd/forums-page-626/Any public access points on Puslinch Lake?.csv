508435,vinnimon,2010-10-01 02:28:00,2593,"  That goes for pail fillers as well(theres not as many anymore). Fishing mountsberg years back, thats all all you seen along the shore,now there are none and not as many!HMMMMMM!!!!!!!"
508463,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-10-01 04:12:00,0," Well, you can trip and fall if the current is fast... and yes I've seen people up to their waist, makes you wonder if they are less intelligent or what... standing where the fish is likely to be. I've seen it all, even on dams, and people without waders doing this."
507790,shimano25,2010-09-28 23:27:00,31,I know that Puslinch Lake (near Cambridge) is surrounded by private property. But I was wondering if anyone here knows of any public access points along the shore to fish.
507814,redfearn27,2010-09-29 00:22:00,2,Im pretty sure that there is a spot about 200 ft. to the left of the entrance where you could fish along the shore. I'll try to figure it out for ya...im from cambridge too
507825,jediangler,2010-09-29 00:47:00,1923,If you want to fish from shore you're better off fishing Little Lake in front of Puslinch lake. There are a number of places along the road where you could cast a line and you have a much better chance of catching something than if you fished Puslinch from shore.
507830,Musky or Specks,2010-09-29 01:02:00,2710,This
507841,xkempx,2010-09-29 01:30:00,84,"Just make sure you ONLY bring weedless rigs....The weeds this time off year are crazy, Laying on top of the Water and 4feet deep.... I had my boat out there last week and wish I didn't...Little lake is best for off shore fishing"
507842,danbouck,2010-09-29 01:32:00,4380,Hit the grand instead
507845,xkempx,2010-09-29 01:40:00,84,
507856,jediangler,2010-09-29 03:08:00,1923,"After all the rain we've had the last two days, I don't think the Grand will be very productive. Go to Shade's Mill and fish from shore."
507857,timmeh,2010-09-29 03:13:00,609,As mentioned much more shore access at Shades Mills.
507872,danbouck,2010-09-29 11:02:00,4380,there's no fish in Shades
507876,vinnimon,2010-09-29 11:19:00,2593,Mountsberg is a better option from shore.
507900,sauce,2010-09-29 13:39:00,219,"Puslinch from shore is not really worth it IMO. Like mentioned above, try the Grand. Lots of access points. Lots of fish. All the rain we got brought the level up but didn't do too much to visibility. Just a bit stained. One nice thing about all that rain, it washed out a lot of the weeds that had collected along the shorelines."
508303,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-09-30 21:06:00,0, o rly? There can be quite alot of traffic there.
508320,ch312,2010-09-30 22:00:00,1590," river in brantford is up a bit and muddy as of 5:30pm today. ive never had much luck for anything but catfish in the river under the same conditions. but, you never know."
508332,timmeh,2010-09-30 22:56:00,609," He's messing with you, people are there for a reason."
508333,danbouck,2010-09-30 22:59:00,4380, To feed the ducks! no fish
508347,vinnimon,2010-09-30 23:21:00,2593,"Yuppers, no fish there! They have ducks! I thought it was the squirrels they were feeding!  "
508351,danbouck,2010-09-30 23:25:00,4380," that too. That's why it's a great place, always lots of animals to feed!"
508361,vinnimon,2010-09-30 23:54:00,2593,  I wasnt fed at all!
508371,FISHINGNUT,2010-10-01 00:10:00,253,Thats why there is no fish there  .Dont get me wrong YES it has fish but compared to just a short 3-4 yrs ago its been hammered hard for a very small body of water which IMO has seriously affected the fish populations there
508373,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-10-01 00:20:00,0, Maybe you're not using the right bait.... just like any other non-productive fishing spots you go to.  just sayin
508374,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-10-01 00:25:00,0," Actually the biggest problem would be the current, could get dangerous if you're wading, and as far as I know the weeds and other floating debris are always a problem. I agree though that the visibility is not as bad as I thought this time around."
508375,vinnimon,2010-10-01 00:26:00,2593,"That whole area is overfished!Its not what it used to be,at all!  "
508378,timmeh,2010-10-01 00:41:00,609," Not overfished, but over harvested. Guys leaving with pails, plastic bags and anything that holds fish. But don't dare say anything too them though. A guy fishing with 6 kids is clearly right to take home 7 limits of fish at every possible opportunity.   :wallbash:  Still a few around, but you're not the first to say not as many as there used to be."
508407,sauce,2010-10-01 01:35:00,219,"I don't know about you, but when I'm wading I never feel like I'm in any danger. Even when the river is up. Why? Because its rare for me to go more than knee deep. It kinda bugs me when I see guys up to their waist standing in prime fish holding water. But I guess if you got chest waders you might as well go as deep as possible right?"
