508076,Nipfisher,2010-09-30 01:50:00,2449,I had a buddy go there on Monday. He went to Parry Island (over the bridge) and fished for rainbows beside the hatchery. It costs $10 for a special licence there and kids under 12 are free. 2 Bows is the limit and you can drive right up to the retaining wall and fish from your vehicle or off the wall. He didn't have any luck but he witnessed two big ones including a 10 pounder get caught. The only advice he gave me was bring a long handle or stick to attach to your landing net because the water is 10 feet below the wall. He was using roe bags but the guy who caught the 2 bows was using the power bait play-dough stuff. Bobber with about 8' of line below. My buddy saw 3-4 surface so a spinner may work as well.  No advice for eyes sorry.
508107,fishforfun,2010-09-30 02:38:00,105,The Parry Sound area is large right in the sound or outside?
508123,tb4me,2010-09-30 04:44:00,3295,"Well they are in the sound, so in town would be best. however we would be into a bit of a small road trip."
508134,fishforfun,2010-09-30 09:49:00,105,Go to the Scuba/bait shop on Bowes St. they  should send you in the right direction.
508169,tb4me,2010-09-30 14:08:00,3295,Ill have my friend go there in the next few days. Thanks. Is there any dams or locks in the area the waleyes will come into at night?
508173,Peps,2010-09-30 14:21:00,191,"Mill Lake right off HWY 69. There is a dam there and we use to catch walleye all the time, jighead and a minnow.   Peps"
