Lost a lot due to improper hook set and broken line from sharp teeth of some fish, I was using 12 lb line.  http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0008.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/sept21.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0001-1.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0003.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0004.jpg'>http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0004.jpg  smallest Salmon I got http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/small.jpg  Some GTA pike photos from last weekend. http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0005-1.jpg http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0004.jpg  I believe there are still few more salmon to arrived to your local tribe/pier once the weather gets colder. So don't give up on trying to aim for them as of yet. Best time to go is from 1-7am in the morning.  I did not have to take any fish and all were release since I used artificial to aim for them. My bait of choice aside from glow lures and crank baits....colored yarn and oil found on oyster and mussle can, sold at your local dollar stores: http://i223.photobucket.com/albums/dd294/bassfighter_album/IMG_0005.jpg.  Most negative experience was seeing too many female gutted out for their eggs and the body left to rot. I confront few guys and they responded with no sense of guilt that someone else might take the meat home."
