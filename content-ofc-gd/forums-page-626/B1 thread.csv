505131,PikeMolester,2010-09-20 01:48:00,428,I am going to be a scrutineer
505308,fish-miester,2010-09-20 19:04:00,864,I'll be there as a Scrutineer
506556,mbac31,2010-09-24 22:29:00,904,Hope to see some OFNers out there this coming October 2-3. I will have the boat with the Rod Glove and the G Loomis stickers on the boat. Drop by and say hi. This is gonna be an amazing event. I cant sleep now as it is.
508068,darsky,2010-09-30 01:38:00,586,with all this rain and high winds it looks like a real tough go this weekend.Cold nights forecasted too. Hope the fish don't have lockjaw. I am predicting low weights this year and a really tough day 2. I'll be there on Sunday to cheer for some people I know.
508080,Gman,2010-09-30 01:53:00,126, Wanted to join as a scrutineer however got inventory this weekend. Maybe next year!  Who are the people you're rootin' for so we can follow it all Saturday eve after day 1 along with some of the previously mentioned names?  Cheers G.
508110,darsky,2010-09-30 02:56:00,586,cant really say his name on a public forum as I think he is one of the TOP contenders and he doesn't need that light shed on him
508150,Harrison,2010-09-30 12:43:00,2202,"I have quite a few buddies fishing it as well.  Hope the winds stay down for them this weekend.  From what I have heard it's a tough bite.  But someone will gett'em.  I am going to go with the Izumi's, Deforges, or Strub.  But I hope Sims can pull it off with all the pressure on them to repeat.  In the end the fish have the last word anyways."
508243,darsky,2010-09-30 18:13:00,586,  Sim did not win the event last year-he was not even in the top 15. I do not think any of them will finish in the top 5
508256,Harrison,2010-09-30 18:36:00,2202," I am talking about the St Francis and 30lbs Canadian record he won the event with there last year.  There is some awesome big water great lake anglers signed up. Barry Graves and Jason Gough are there as well, consistant big water fall smallie guys. I plan to fish it next year.  Maybe he'll move it alittle more west.. Kingston would be perfect."
508262,Roy,2010-09-30 18:53:00,13728,I think that Darren and I have picked the same horse.  Anything can happen though.
508264,Harrison,2010-09-30 18:59:00,2202,"I have heard from a few guys about the calibre of anglers from your neck of the woods Roy and Darren, should be fun to follow the T."
508751,Lungelarry,2010-10-02 23:37:00,294,"Curries in first place after day one....like all 144 teams didn,t know he was the guy to watch.(and he still kicked everybodies ass)"
508763,Roy,2010-10-03 00:09:00,13728,hahahaha Guess who my pick was? He needs a good day tomorrow though. Congrats to you so far Monsieur Mark.
508786,Gman,2010-10-03 02:21:00,126,"Currie is always on'em,,,especially when it comes to his backyard!  Looking forward to the weigh-in on day 2 to see if there's gonna be any big plays.  Cheers G."
508789,jeffw,2010-10-03 02:44:00,267,Anyone know how marvin gosse placed?
508903,Roy,2010-10-03 19:58:00,13728,Marvin was in 13th place after day one which is pretty darned good considering who the players are. I have no idea on today's results as I could not attend today's weigh-in. I hope Larry Lafleur (LungeLarry) made some progress....the dude is good at what he does.
508914,Roy,2010-10-03 21:09:00,13728,Any news? Please?
508952,darsky,2010-10-03 23:23:00,586,Currie was last to weigh in and needed 17.70ish to win. The scale settled on 17.18 for a tremendous second place. None of the 3 teams over 24lbs from day 1 shined today. I bet one dropped fish was the difference today. Only one limit was over 20lbs today with most teams reporting difficult fishing. I believe Smalliefisher ended up a VERY respectable top 15
508953,PikeMolester,2010-10-03 23:23:00,428,Currie finished 2nd. The Chopins won http://www.wfn.tv/berkleyb1/
