508327,keram,2010-09-30 22:30:00,585,"Is it possible that water meter register higher water usage then actual? O.K. Let me explain. Today I had a phone call from my water company to check my water meter reading, because my usage  was somewhat higher then normal. Ive checked it and is really, really HIGHER   then normal. There is no leak (leak indicator is not moving ). So I did experiment. I would like to follow my way of reasoning, because I could be wrong. My meter counts cubic meters of water, one full turn of the dial is 100 litres. There is a toilet close to the meter. Ive flushed toilet 8 times (closing the supply valve each time) to get full turn of the dial (100 litres).  Math is pretty simple 100/8=12.5 litres = 3.17 gal Now Ive used jug from windshield washer fluid ( 1 gal or 3.78 l) and I needed only two gallons of water to fill the tank to the same level. So, my 2 gal of water shows as 3.17   gal on the meter. Another thing. Ive filled the same jug twice ( approx 7.5 litres), my meter registered 10 litres of usage. I know that defective meter shows lower usage ( due to wear & tear) but higher. Please share any ideas In mean time I will start looking for the in ground pool on my property Im sure it is not in a living room."

508582,IndySKS,2010-10-01 21:56:00,134,"I'm interested to hear the outcome of this, i work for a municipality and the water supervisor is right across the hall from me. I have heard him tell many people the same thing your water dept told you.  From what i know of meters they always read less if worn out, then again there is that 0.01 % i guess. what type of meter is it...brand wise. my bet is one of your toilets is leaking keep us informed  edit: For what it's worth in the 6 years working with him and all the meters he has looked at, never has it been the meter, he is a licensed plumber too and always seems to help find the problem."
