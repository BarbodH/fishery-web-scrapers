We recognized each other after a minute or two! My buds boat ran out of gas on the lower niagara,We had a trolling motor that was getting us back very slowly! Anyway I think he drives a new dark  nissan pathfinder,his boat is a new 20 or 22 ft white Tahoe with manual riggers, fishing the lower niagara today.Hes from hamilton as well.  I would like to thank him and his 2 buds for their generous assistance today!They took 45 minutes out of their fishing time to help us out! Thank You, Kindly!"

508722,Pigeontroller,2010-10-02 21:33:00,2793,Good thing you weren't on the Upper Niagara!
508725,vinnimon,2010-10-02 21:51:00,2593,"  The funny thing, Lew! I asked him if he topped up the gas!Yup he said!I should of been more specific in my line of questioning!My theory, a half tank,is 2/3 empty!!/3 to get there,2/3 to get back. With 3 batteries on board, fully charged! I wasnt worried at all.Just took a while!The boater and his buds were an added bonus,with their assistance and all!"
