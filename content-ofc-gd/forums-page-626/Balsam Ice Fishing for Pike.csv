508851,Shaky,2010-10-03 13:40:00,25,I'm either going to fish Balsam or Cameron.  My cottage is on Cameron so I would rather fish it but if I can take a few pike out of the system I'm up for that.  So did anyone catch a pike ice fishing on Balsam?  If so where?  I know some guys fished South Bay last year but have not read a report of any pike being caught.
508944,chrispyke,2010-10-03 22:35:00,51,"I had my hut out on South Bay last year.  We didn't fish that much but ended up catching about 30 perch and 20 OOS walleye and saw a huge musky !  There were Pike caught in West Bay closer to the opening of the Trent to Mitchell.  There were a few caught in North Bay as well, by the Park and a few caught up closer to Coby.  I'm not sure if I can mention another board on here or not,(I'm sure the mods will remove if need be) but try the kawarthaanglers dot com board and you will find some posts from people last winter and where the pike were caught.  If you fish low light with live minnows EXPECT to get a fair amount of OOS walleye that have to be released dead or alive.  Good luck !  BL"
