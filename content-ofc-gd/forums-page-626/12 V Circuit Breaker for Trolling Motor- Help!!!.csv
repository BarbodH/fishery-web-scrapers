508609,baironhorse,2010-10-02 01:04:00,145,I set up this rig as it works best with 4 guage wire and everything fits inside battery box to keep dry. I used a brass plate drilled holes and bent to fit. Check below pics and let me know if this is a safe system. Brass was only metal I had around garage. Let me know if this will work on 50amp breaker and is safe and won't mess up my battery. Im a newbie but learning quickly!!! Your thoughts!!!      
508640,Muskieman,2010-10-02 02:34:00,2472," Just put some Dielectric grease on the terminals and forget it. If ya wanna go all the way and be fancy, Epoxy the C/B to the vent cap of your battery.  I see no problem... kinda looks like my setup... no problems for me as of yet.  Good job!  Randy "
508659,scugpg,2010-10-02 11:19:00,1373,Yup that looks good and a great idea!  For my setup I made a small 2 gauge link to the battery from the breaker but had to put some pieces of plastic in between the breaker terminals because those ring terminals were awfully close to touching each other.
508771,baironhorse,2010-10-03 00:57:00,145,I decided to make another bracket out of steel and not use my original brass one....Yes Sugog I know what you mean about those terimals close together. I put a large zip tie down the centre of breaker and once all bolted together it acts as a good wegde to keep things in line and not touching. Here are a couple of pics. Let me know what you think....I can't wait for long weekend to get my baby back in the water!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      
508783,baironhorse,2010-10-03 02:00:00,145,Do I slather it on +ve terminal bottom and on bracket where it touches bottom of terminal and on top or bracket where wing nut will fasten?  Also do I spread some on all breaker connection points???  
508837,Fisherman,2010-10-03 12:52:00,7201,"Personal preference, I would have stayed with the brass, unless you paint or grease up the steel.. rust.. Cut the breaker studs down a bit, less chance of something getting caught on them."
508954,baironhorse,2010-10-03 23:26:00,145,I ended up using my original brass bracket...re dieelctric grease do I grease it up in between and on top of all connection points? 
508956,vinnimon,2010-10-03 23:32:00,2593,"  Cake it on,all over!Its non conductive!The grease that is!"
508958,Fisherman,2010-10-03 23:36:00,7201,"""Dielectric grease is a non-conductive, silicone grease designed to seal out moisture and, therefore, prevent corrosion  on electrical connectors. Being non-conductive, it does not enhance the flow of electrical current. This property makes it an ideal lubricant and sealant for the rubber portions of electrical connectors"". Therefore, you put all your connectors together before applying a light coat of di-grease around them, otherwise you end up with ""weak"" electrical connections."
