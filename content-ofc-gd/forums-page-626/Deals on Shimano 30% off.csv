508092,moemoe,2010-09-30 02:16:00,352,"Hi guys just a heads up and to get off the musky topic, I hear from my local shop, Bills Bait, that Shimano has dropped all their prices by 30%, Too bad I just purchased a couple tekotas already this spring, I don't know what other shops have done, but Greg and Tim have dropped the price on their inventory already, and supposedly this not sale but a change in pricing strategy"
508095,Gregoire,2010-09-30 02:19:00,1397,Le Barons dropped their prices a while ago.
508125,bdox,2010-09-30 04:58:00,329,They have the new Curado 50E @ $218. That's a damn good price considering it's selling for $199 in the US.  http://www.lebaron.ca/pdffiles/web_feat/shimano_curadoTDR_web.pdf
508181,sandmann,2010-09-30 15:05:00,51,just called lebaron but they don't have any lefties yet ARGH!  Attractive price point
508469,fish_fishburn,2010-10-01 11:00:00,1311,It's about time they adjusted their prices to reflect our dollars strength when comparing it to the american greenback.
508589,scugpg,2010-10-01 22:37:00,1373,Does that include GLoomis?
508601,Gregoire,2010-10-02 00:21:00,1397,The last time I was at lebarons both shimano and g-loomis were on sale
508665,ra95,2010-10-02 13:11:00,49,GL 30% off from catalog Shimano 25% off All good stuff are gone already. Lebaron is awesome.

508830,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-03 12:29:00,2690,"So are we going to see this price reduction throughout Ontario, make that Canada????  I definitely NEED, want...no NEED a few ice fishing reels!"
