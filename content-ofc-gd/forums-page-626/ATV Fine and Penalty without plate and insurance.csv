295120,Big Cliff,2009-01-20 22:38:00,6899,"I have had boat insurance since I had my first boat and wouldn't have it any other way. If it gets stolen; covered! Catches fire; covered! Hit a rock; covered! Insurance is just that, you hope you never have to use it but if you ever do it sure is nice to have it."
295122,Guest skeeter99,2009-01-20 22:44:00,0,"  100% agreed  and dont be afraid to make claims your insurance does not go up, it is there use it"
295124,Big Cliff,2009-01-20 22:53:00,6899,"Ya, the only insurance I'm not big on is ""life insurance"" (I'm not in a hurry to make a claim on it even if the rates don't go up) !If I ever have to use it I haven't figured out how I can still be around to collect it LOL!"
295127,purekgw,2009-01-20 23:00:00,585,i have got fined for not haveing insurance while ridding a dirt bike. I dont know how he found me i was in the middle of no where.
295137,CRAPPIE,2009-01-20 23:47:00,213,How much they fined you?
295141,Big Cliff,2009-01-20 23:54:00,6899,"Beans and I got nailed for ""no helmits"" two years ago on Simco, $65.00 each. I thought that was a bit unfair, we weren't going any faster than a man could walk but, the law is the law so we paid our fines and learned our lesson."
295185,misfish,2009-01-21 01:01:00,29133, Ah the good ol days eh Cliff. Still like it was yesturday.LOL

295236,cityfisher,2009-01-21 03:20:00,959,Ive seen TONES of people doubling up on quads on the ice... Ive done it myself atleast 100 times... MNR have never bugged me about it
295477,johndox,2009-01-21 22:55:00,54,"Got stopped on Saturday on lake Erie by 2 OPP on quads. We had 2 quads pulling sleds with our equipment on them and 8 people, 4 riding on the quads and the the rest riding on the sleds. 1 driver had no insurance or ownership with him and they let him go with a warning. They also gave us warnings saying anybody on the quad or sleds need to have a helmet on. Gave us  a stern warning about booze and drinking and driving and they would be doing checks as we left the ice. Then they wished us luck and were gone....guess they were just educating and not ticketing. Didnt think to ask what the fines would be we were just happy they left."

508454,Nipfisher,2010-10-01 03:08:00,2449,"The ATV industry is trying to get legislation to allow for passengers on the new (2010 and up) 2-up models. My understanding is that they will not grandfather any older bikes. Just 2010 and newer. I had an after marketpassenger seat on my 2000 Honda 450 and I took it off becuse I was told by police that I would get ticketed. My 7 year old always wanted to go for a ride on it so I got rid of it rather then keep telling him no.  On Nipising in the winter the OPP and MNR don't pay too much attention to the ATVers. Usually not going too fast or driving crazy. Just wear a helmet! The OPP do ""police"" the snowmobiles more because they are often ripping accross the lakes like lunatics. My sled is a 1993 Skandic 503 so I don't have any speed issues lol."

294724,Guest skeeter99,2009-01-19 22:46:00,0,"  no have not  but dont get caught without it the mnr or the police will write you up in a blink for that, seen happen quite a bit on some of the more popular lakes, and ignorance is not a defense  atv's must have plates and insurance unless strictly on private land other than that you need the latter"
294727,CRAPPIE,2009-01-19 22:51:00,213,how much for the fine?
294734,solopaddler,2009-01-19 23:01:00,8605,  One can only hope.
294743,forrest,2009-01-19 23:18:00,1032,On the low end of ticketing....20 years ago it was $500 worth of tickets for me an my off road vehicle.  I got off because the engine was not engaged when the cop flagged me.  Maybe it is the same now as driving with no auto insurance....that would be in the thousands: http://www.traffic-ticket-speeding-point.c...ance-ticket.php

294756,irishfield,2009-01-19 23:34:00,26272,http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/orv.shtml  Also note you can't carry a passenger on an ATV on the highway/road!.. heck possibly the ice !  Says $300 fine in here for contravening any section of the act. And it talks of permits and insurance.  http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/...tes_90o04_e.htm  I always wondered about being on the ice... not a road etc..but they get you there by stating you can only ignore these regulations if on property that you own !
294765,Sinker,2009-01-19 23:45:00,8692,You can double ride on an ATV...just not on a road......now.....define a road??  A lake is for sure not a road!  Sinker
294790,raysfish2005,2009-01-20 00:22:00,163,"Well i  have an 89 atv and my insurance company will not insure it,as its over ten year old, i have plates but no insurance, And the kicker is i only use it 2 or 3 times a year. i have tried to find insurance but i cant justify $400.00 bucks when i only use it for icefishing in march. Also they wont insure you if you intend to drive it on the ice........lol i laughed at that one!"
294792,BUSTER,2009-01-20 00:28:00,1336,"people in sudbury were getting tickets on the trail for that, unless it was the factory 2 -up seat from can-am or similar but the backrack you strap down wouldn't qualify for 2up seating?"
294799,workwear,2009-01-20 00:53:00,592,hold on a sec.....so let me understand this.....you need insurance while driving an atv on the ice.....but if your driving  a boat  on the water you dont need any.........  now that i dont understand
294800,Sinker,2009-01-20 00:54:00,8692,  A trail is considered a road.
294816,Fisherman,2009-01-20 01:23:00,7201,"Unless I'm completely wrong on this one, I'm sure the regulations have NOT been amended to ride double unless on private property.  It's a thorn for the ATV'ers, sometimes the fuzz turns a blind eye(don't know which direction), but you get caught, pay the piper.  The rules are there for everyone to read and heed, ignornace is only for les ignorantes."
294824,Pinch,2009-01-20 01:40:00,231,"An atv can only be operated on a highway if the municipality passes a bylaw allowing it.  Then you have to have a plate ownership insurance drivers licence a helmet, and no passengers.  Here is the definition of a highway according to the highway traffic act:  â€œhighwayâ€, includes a common and public highway, street, avenue, parkway, driveway, square, place, bridge, viaduct or trestle, any part of which is intended for or used by the general public for the passage of vehicles and includes the area between the lateral property lines thereof; (â€œrouteâ€)   Driving on the ice you would fall under the off road vehicles act and you need a helmet, ownership, and insurance.  There is nothing in the Off road vehicle act that says you are not allowed to have passengers.  Here's a link to the fines for the off road vehicles act.  FINES"
294826,Sinker,2009-01-20 01:45:00,8692,"I could be wrong too Fisherman.....but I understand it the same as Pinch.  I know on a trail system, no passengers, on a road......no passengers......on the lake......go for it.......as far as I can read into it anyways.  I don't have an ATV, but I deal with them all day long when the snow is gone.  Sinker"
294840,mikemcmillan,2009-01-20 02:23:00,50,"How is a ATV on ice different than a snowmobile, do you also need insurance to go out on the ice? I take my sled out from the cottage to a couple if fishing spots, 2 or 3 miles max but I don't have insurance. Do have ownership and a currant sticker. Knock on wood, never been stopped."
294841,irishfield,2009-01-20 02:24:00,26272,I think the only thing on earth that doesn't require insurance is a boat. Still haven't figured out how the insurance industry hasn't swayed that one as well.. but..
294851,Fisherman,2009-01-20 02:39:00,7201,SSSsssssH! Slap yourself.
294855,Fisherman,2009-01-20 02:45:00,7201," Yes you are correct that there's nothing in the ORV Act about carrying passengers, it's in the bowels of some damm regulation I can't find at the moment.  However, Reg 316 outlines that Trappers and Emergency workers can carry passengers in the line of their work or duty, it doesn't cover the rest of us. Trusty me, I read the blasted thing and unless it;'s been amended, you can't ride double.  It's a big sticky point with ATVers, you buy a machine with a double seat but can't use it.  Anyway, unless you're riding like you're on a double dose of nut juice, most should be okay."
294884,POLLIWOGG,2009-01-20 03:12:00,835,"2 years ago a coast guard guy said mandatory ins. for boats was coming, so it'll be here sooner or later."
