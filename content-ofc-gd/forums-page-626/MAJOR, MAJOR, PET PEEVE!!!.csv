507806,ehg,2010-09-29 00:02:00,2666,"That is very important to point out that the size limit is 44"" for musky on Zone 17(Kawarthas) this year. Also the season is extended to Dec. 15th  for musky and bass as well.  One walleye with conservation license between 35-50 cm, 4 with a sport license. Walleye closes on Nov. 15th."
507819,TJQ,2010-09-29 00:27:00,7806,"I dont fish muskies, but have a pair of small bolt cutters in my box... once you've had a hook in your hand, you wont make that mistake twice."

507938,ssminnow,2010-09-29 16:44:00,48, Well said.
508047,mercman,2010-09-30 01:10:00,7054," bravo !!!! when we are on the water,we are obliged to assist anyone requesting assistance as long as it does not put us at risk of bodily harm.I sure hope that if i am in an emergency situation someone like you will be close by.as for the muskie, i know right from wrong,but i don't know what a believer lure is,so i'm not sure if mushy is what they were after.I won't comment on that.All i know is sometimes you don't catch what you're looking for.I have caught some surprising things bass fishing. 8 lb pike, sheapshead,perch pumpkin seed and even a 27"" walleye, never a muskie though. I'd probably pee myself"
508159,bigbuck,2010-09-30 13:37:00,2449,"A Believer is a BIG bait used primarily for muskie and big pike. These guys were muskie fishing, no doubt about that."
508160,stubbex1,2010-09-30 13:47:00,164," yup believer is primarily musky bait, although i have caught some really aggressive smallies on my 6incher..... I say primarily b/c my friend bought a tackle box at an auction a couple of years back, and in it was a 3 1/2 lure shaped like a  believer (non jointed), he used it at our fly in last fall, and he outfished us all with it. ONe walleye after another....i've tried finding that bait everywhere, no luck LOL"
508204,mercman,2010-09-30 16:14:00,7054,"well i'm gonna do it right next year, im gonna get someone in boucherville who will remain nameless to take me out and show me how......  "
508357,camillj,2010-09-30 23:39:00,1988,"Agree 100% - Cant say enough good things about the Knipex ... they aint cheap .. but they sure do work .. fast and like cutting through butter ... I always keep them and my 10"" needlenose pliers OUT and on the bench beside me ... right there on the towel I wipe the slime off my hands with"
507241,bigbuck,2010-09-27 14:13:00,2449,"On Saturday, I was out on Pigeon Lake musky fishing in a little tourney we put on every year. While trolling down Big Island, a tinny trolling in front of us caught a nice 'ski. I saw them struggling with the fish and called out if they needed help as they were washing up on the rocky shoreline, and they replied that they needed help. We went over using the electric with my I/O trimmed right up and there was a 43""er with a Believer in it's mouth and the one guy's hand deep hooked twice. They did not have needle nose pliers, no cutters, not even a proper net. All they had were a pair of old rusty pliers. I reached over with my Knipex cutters and easily cut the hook off the lure to help out the guy with the hooks in his hand. One barb went right through so I cut that one off and pulled that hook out, the other one, I told him to go to the hospital. We then cut the hooks out of the musky and these guys decide they want to keep it. By this point, it had been out of the water for over 10 minutes so I doubt it would have survived, it was bleeding out of the gills and fins but I would have tried to revive it, at least give the old girl a chance. MORAL OF THE STORY, don't go musky fishing if you don't have the proper tools, it's bad for the fish and downright dangerous for you."
507243,Joey,2010-09-27 14:27:00,9122,Agree absolutely 100% with this Bigbuck!!!  Joey
507245,Lunker777,2010-09-27 14:45:00,866,"you should have motored away when you saw they came un prepared !!! Let them figure out how to get the hooks out !!  I troll alot in the thames, and I just want to smack the people you see in a small tinny with like 6'6 ugly sticks and spinning reels !!!  I dunno...."
507255,Terry,2010-09-27 15:07:00,14456,well I don't think you should fish for any fish unprepared  whether it's muskie or gobies
507260,splashhopper,2010-09-27 15:27:00,2931," when i troll the thames, i am hunting for bass with that equipment"
507261,Lunker777,2010-09-27 15:29:00,866," Exactly.... I mean if you hook into a Musky with bass gear... obviously thats a different situation ! But if your trolling a 8"" jake ..."
507273,John,2010-09-27 15:54:00,2956,I may have removed BOTH hooks from his hand!.....
507286,Spiel,2010-09-27 16:22:00,9065,"  Agreed, my dry well is always ready for Gobies......  At any rate good on you for helping him out, hopefully next time they'll be better prepared.  "
507287,lew,2010-09-27 16:33:00,12766," There was a post here a coupla weeks back where someone was asking if it was worth spending the extra $$$$ to buy Knipex cutters rather than cheapo side cutters for musky fishing.  This was the EXACT scenario I used to explain why Knipex cutters are worth their weight in gold. You get hung up on a large musky with a couple big trebles buried in your hand and if your Mickey Mouse cutters won't work, your in HUGE trouble, specially if your alone in the boat.  If your fishing for muskies,  BUY THE PROPER CUTTERS.  Kudos to you Bruce for helping those boys out !!"
507302,ld17,2010-09-27 17:17:00,319, That's great that you helped them out.  I'm wondering if your not a bit peved that you didn't catch a muskie and the tinny did...lol
507337,cityfisher,2010-09-27 18:19:00,959,+1  lots of Gong shows out there !
507345,bigbuck,2010-09-27 18:36:00,2449,"What peeved me the most, is that I have some chips in my gelcoat from banging rocks helping these boneheads out. I helped them out because it was obvious they needed it. My good deed for the year."
507360,mbosh1980,2010-09-27 19:10:00,349,This story just screams the name of a buddy of mine... He may have trouble texting me back if it was.
507368,ehg,2010-09-27 19:42:00,2666,"HaHa, that's my musky fishing stompin grounds, wasn't there this weekend but would have helped if was around. Hopefully they became edumacated about these things now. At least you helped them out."
507394,perchslayer666,2010-09-27 20:49:00,280,"The Muskie dies, a guy goes to the hospital, and your boat gets dinged up..... A lose, lose, lose situation. At least the 'ski earned its spot on the dinner plate next to the canned beans and potatoes."
507398,limeyangler,2010-09-27 21:01:00,5204,Good job helping out buck.....horror story really...but you earned a lot of Karma points....it will come around to you eventually.
507405,fishermccann,2010-09-27 21:14:00,655,"Sorry , but I too, am not ready for everything, all the time. It happens. Good for you!"
507410,rapala14,2010-09-27 21:22:00,44,Good on you for helpin the boys out.  Hopefully they learned a valuable lesson.
507466,Rizzo,2010-09-27 23:11:00,4754,"good on you for helping...next time ask first if they plan on releasing the fish! If its ""no"" just take off  :whistling:  Just kidding of course (...or am I  )"
507472,brickNblock,2010-09-27 23:27:00,598,"...sorry to hear about the ""chips"" in the gelcoat Bruce!..but good on ya for lending a hand. (insert Karma comming here)  CLASSIC situation for musky newbies. ....Be Freaking Prepared or dont Freaking bother!"
507659,jimmer,2010-09-28 15:00:00,2730,"Everyone's horror story for sure.  A proper net or cradle would definitely help prevent a scenario like that. They kept a sub legal fish???? I live on that lake and it drives me crazy the number of stories I hear about muskie being killed because of lack of knowledge or anglers just ignoring the regs, because it was their so called ""biggest fish"". Good on you for helping that poor guy out with the hooks.  Just can't imagine a 40+"" fish attached to me by a Believer.  I sure hope that guy is at Bass Pro buying all the required equipment!"
507669,Kinger,2010-09-28 15:26:00,351,Need more guys like you out there. Kudos.
507670,Lunker777,2010-09-28 15:26:00,866," You really think that will happen ???? He is probably at home nursing his injuries, telling all his buddies about the huge fish they caught and BLAH BLAH BLAH.... only to be waiting for the chance to do it all over again !  I would be surprised if he even thought twice about spending money of proper gear.... its not cheap! $150 for a net most likely isn't on his ""things to do list"""
507693,jimmer,2010-09-28 16:20:00,2730,So hoping is hopeless?
507775,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-09-28 22:41:00,0," Are you for real? Honestly? I would have risked smashing my propeller and everything else to help the guy if I could, as I would want someone to help me out in that same situation. Having 2 big treble hooks stuck in you is no picnic!  This guy could have lost his hand/bled to death and you guys are worried about the fish??Unbeleivable!  Here on OFC we try to educate people as much as we can but not everyone is a pro and as knowledgable about musky fishing as they should be. These accidents happen and they shouldn't be punished for not knowing.  Good on you for helping out. Hope the guy is ok.  P.S. I dont know why most hardcore Musky tackle shops dont carry knipex bolt cutters and mention to the customers that are buying big baits that they should own one."
