507132,walleyejack,2010-09-27 00:55:00,358,"Anyone know anything about Pflueger spinning reels ? President in particular,I don t see much on the net about them,have been offered one for $60.by a travelling salesman that is coming to Ont in Nov to peddle them. Found them on one site for $60.but doesn t seem like much of a deal,wanna do some Wally fishing and ice fishing with it possibly Your input is welcome"
507139,danbouck,2010-09-27 01:06:00,4380,"I have a supreme spinning, a supreme baitcaster and a trion spinning, they are all amazing."
507149,alexmedic,2010-09-27 01:35:00,186,"I own 3 of them. 2 - 6125's and 1 - 6130.  I love them all.  Smooth drag and great feel.  Hard to get parts though.  I lost the dust cap for the where the reel handle screws in, called Pflueger Canada several times and left multiple voice mails.  I eventually just gave up.  $60 is a fait price, not a steal though.  I think BPS sells them for $69 + tax.."
507644,ohhenrygsr,2010-09-28 14:18:00,947,I love my Pflueger reels i have a couple of president 6130 and Supremes.  $60 a piece is an awesome deal.  You will find that the Supreme is a bit lighter and faster gear ratio for them crazy fast smallies lol
507647,asdve23rveavwa,2010-09-28 14:27:00,2690,Happy with my Arbor.
507655,walleyejack,2010-09-28 14:44:00,358,"ok thanks, haven t made the deal yet, still thinking, buddy won t be in ONtario till nov. or something like that. I don t like the idea of hard to find parts tho. Thanks everyone"
507822,gaspumper,2010-09-29 00:36:00,393,"Ive had my president going on 4 years works flawless,never needed parts,also have a supreme,both excellent reels,one nice thing about them the spools are interchangeable."
507882,jimmer,2010-09-29 12:29:00,2730,Don't worry about the parts.  They are great reels.  Offer him $50.
507897,perchslayer666,2010-09-29 13:31:00,280,"It's only a $60 reel, who cares if the parts are hard to find? I would be more concerned about the warranty, since you didn't buy it from a retailer how are you going to get an exchange, or repaired if something is defective with it?"
507931,EC1,2010-09-29 16:15:00,930,"Pretty amazing reels if you ask me. I actually just got a president ! I've got 3 reels in total, the patriarch xt baitcaster, president, and supreme.  The supreme has been around for about 5 years and has been abused as ever, but still reeling fish in nicely.  The Patriarch XT has a titanium coating finish that I've yet to have put a single scratch on for 3-4 months now. Light and smooth too. Better than a curado? My biased answer is yes.  Bought the president for dropshotting, and so far it seems more solid than my Shimano Sahara(09). Line lay system is not very good, but it shouldn't be a problem at all."
507937,JoshS,2010-09-29 16:43:00,729,I bought one for my Dad in the spring.  It broke in the fall haha.  I lent it to my buddy to do some pier casting for salmon and he was getting into a few... after a few fish the reel locked up.  Took it apart and something had broken inside so I removed the broken-off part and surprisingly he continued to fish with it without problems.  Probably shouldn't of taken it out for big kings but I can tell you my stradic doesn't break like under the same circumstance.  For the price its a good reel but if you do a lot of fishing I always recommend quality stuff that will last.
507942,solopaddler,2010-09-29 17:00:00,8605,They're the best reels on the market in that price point by a country mile in my opinion.
507946,ctranter,2010-09-29 17:08:00,543,"I have a president spinning reel that I use as my cottage bass setup and I love it.  For 60$, you can't go wrong.  I've never had a problem with it, it runs smoother after 2 years than my sahara."
507964,bare foot wader,2010-09-29 19:25:00,1354,"IMO 60 is fair but not great for the president...I have the president and trion for ice reels....bps usually has a fall sale, that's when i got mine, president was 50 plus tax"
508165,2jack2,2010-09-30 13:59:00,92,"Hi Walleyejack, I have a used President 4735, asking $40, if you are interested, I also have a new 7' ML shimano rod if you are still looking for a rod."
508234,BillsTheBassMan,2010-09-30 17:56:00,932," I own 2 Pflueger reels and I'd agree with Solo here, but I'm never one to cheap out on a reel (save for fly fishing - and only because I'm a beginner).  I'm a firm believer that a Stradic is the best spinning reel on the market and would recommend them to anybody.  More on Pflueger topic, I have an ultralite president reel (couldn't justify the Stradic Ci4 for $200 for ultralite purposes) and it has treated me well.  My one warning would be that you make sure it DOES NOT get wet.  Unlike the Stradic, the Pfluegers tend to seize up when they get wet - as a wading fisherman this is a bit of an issue for me.  The point about the warranty made was a good one - mind you most companies won't quarrel over a $60 product - the good word of mouth beats the potential bad word of mouth."
508240,walleyejack,2010-09-30 18:05:00,358,"ok Thnaks,I have been seeing they are a problem when they get wet,I was planning on doing a little ice fishing with it,but I will stick to my sticks and my wore out Browning for now. thanks   "
508455,Canuck2fan,2010-10-01 03:17:00,1444,"I have owned 3 Presidents and 1 Supreme for over 4yrs now. For the money they are an awesome deal. The only problem I have had was a bail spring broke when I lent my President 6740 it to a friend, I got if fixed under warranty at ""Rockys?"" no issues at all. As for dunking them locking them up I don't know what kind of ""water"" those reels are being dunked in but mine have all seen multiply dunkings and never locked up on me but then I do take them apart once a year and clean them.  What I really like about the President is the extra spool included and the cloth bag to keep the reels fromm getting tangled up in the trunk. Also the spool capacity on the 6740 means I can spool it in the spring, reverse the line in the fall and have ""new"" line."
