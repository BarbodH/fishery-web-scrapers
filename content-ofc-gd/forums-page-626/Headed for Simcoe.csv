508573,SlowPoke,2010-10-01 20:46:00,2984,"With the forecast calling for wind and cool weather, we'll probably be sticking to the west side or North shore of K-Bay. I keep hearing how good Simcoe is for bass and I've even put a few people onto their PB's but the best I can do is about a 2 lber. Any tips for me? I don't get out on Simcoe more than once or twice a year, I could use all the help I can get!! Feel free to PM the really hot tips and locations!!! -Brian"
