507709,Harrison,2010-09-28 17:47:00,2202,Thanks for taking the time to post Raf.  I'll have a looksee!
507716,John,2010-09-28 18:42:00,2956,"Phil, I have had 3 Grand Cherokee's over the past 12 years. A 4.0L I6, a 3.7 V6 and a 4.7 V8. The 3.7 while OK mechanically was the weakest engine of the 3 and actually used more gas while towing than my current V8. Around town the V8 will use a little more gas though. If you don't mind a 6-7 year old one get a 4.0L. If you want something more current get the 4.7L V8. Bear in mind that the Hemi's are much worse on fuel."
507717,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 18:45:00,5784,"The 2004 Lexus RX and 2004 Acura MDX are in the same price range as the about mentioned vehicles. They are probably wonderful vehicles but definitely lack the ""toughness"" of a 4runner or Xterra."
507720,John,2010-09-28 18:51:00,2956," Like I said, do you want a tough go anywhere 4WD SUV or do you want a poseur ""school run"" vehicle a la Lexus or Acura? As Raf said if there is one brand that is not going to disappear anytime soon it is Jeep."
507731,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 19:38:00,5784, I answered that question in an earlier post. Plus the three options in the poll represent a good off road/on road compromise. Not much the Jeep can do that the 4runner can't. Except run out of gas quicker haha jk.
507737,Uncle Buck,2010-09-28 19:54:00,1000,in that price range....  why not buy a truck and put a lockable tonneau cover on it?  that'll fix your security issue for the rear
507739,Rustic-Fisher,2010-09-28 20:01:00,826,"JK  Rubicon wrangler (stock), is  not comparable to ANY suv in terms of off road capability, There is a reason it was voted best 4x4 of the decade. But you'll sacrifice a smooth ride during day to day driving, but if your using it for logging roads and gettin to back lakes it really is basically an over sized ATV. And yes I have a JK LOL I do also like the 4runner, and am thinking of getting one for my wife. Do a search and compare xterras vs jeeps(wrangler). Start with the suspension, drivetrain, add ons ect... 4runner without question will be more reliable than the jeep, but they really are different creatures. Good luck with your search. R The old X after deer hunting, and yes you could fit a deer in the back with the seats down LOL"
507743,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 20:15:00,5784, That is an option. The Tacoma is a nice ride. Given the extra length it might be more versatile than a 4runner.
507745,JayZ,2010-09-28 20:19:00,18,"if you are considering the xterra, i would definitely look at the 2005+ models as that is when it was re-designed. they put the VQ 4.0L V6 in there which is supposed to be one of the best engines out there. also has 265hp and 5000lb towing capacity. i currently own a 2005 xterra, offroad version with locking differential and have had no problems with it after 170000K. did the friont brakes at 125K and still on original clutch and i do alot of towing every summer. if i had to buy new, i would buy the same again."
507746,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 20:22:00,5784, Great reply. Thank you.
507873,danbouck,2010-09-29 11:07:00,4380," Get a cap for the back and you're set, then you basically have a full size SUV minus the seats"
508203,Harrison,2010-09-30 16:14:00,2202, Thanks John!  Don't need a pickup as my lifestyle has changed (KIDS)... but my want for a V8 has not!
508251,cityfisher,2010-09-30 18:28:00,959, +1 My jeep is great other than 18.5 l per 100 in the city and 14 on the hwy
508255,Raf,2010-09-30 18:35:00,3495,"you must be hard on the skinny pedal cityfisher, i get around 11-11.5 on the hwy with my v8 if i keep at 115 or under."
508274,Uncle Buck,2010-09-30 19:37:00,1000," a 4 door pick up has the same people capacity as an SUV... added benefit is stronger engine, suspension, transmission and bigger brakes...  plus additional storage space... much easier to carry hockey gear, strollers etc... in the back of a pick up compared to an SUV...  add in the cost of a tonneau or a cap and it's still a better way to go when you put it all in perspective  plus trucks have a lower roll over rating compared to SUVs...."
508281,tybrad,2010-09-30 19:46:00,45,"i would stay away from the vw, especially the 2004. They look amazing and drive amazing (especially the v10tdi) but they have had soooo many warranty  issues that I've heard rumors of owners tempted to take them straight to the junker when they go out of warranty because of so many little issues. This is from my experience working at a vw dealership"
507372,Rod Caster,2010-09-27 20:02:00,5784,"Hi all. I may need to get an SUV and I've been looking into suitable vehicles for the job. These three stand out as far as performance, off-road ability and reliability (Toyota at least). I like the Toureg for it's off-road ability and luxury. The 4Runner for fuel mileage, off-road an reliability and the Xterra for off-road and user friendliness for active lifestyles. All in V-6 form.  If you own one, used to own one of know somebody who owns one please provide your opinion and the pros and cons of it. And don't suggest a Honda Pilot...I don't want one."
507436,Muskieman,2010-09-27 22:10:00,2472,"If you find a Touareg with a V10 TDI... don't be scared to buy it but don't expect to have it for long very break-down prone, but .. . it's a CRAZY Machine...It'll smoke any new gas pick-up on the road...  That said   .. I choose the 4Runner .. very Capable unit... but not quite capable as my Expedition.   Randy "
507456,danbouck,2010-09-27 22:48:00,4380,I chose the 4Runner only because I really don't like the other 2 and there wasn't a none of the above option.
507460,Rustic-Fisher,2010-09-27 22:57:00,826,"Had a 2003 Xterra supercharged, Off road it was decent, I bought it pretty much brand new. At around 150000 km thats were things went bad...... Seemed I was having to fix something every month and than at 160000 the head gasket went So off she went  and was traded in on a new jk jeep wrangler and what a machine that is! Good luck with your search R"
507473,Rod Caster,2010-09-27 23:30:00,5784,"  Thanks, this is what I'm looking for. Real experiences. Which motor was that? The supercharged model?"
507480,Roy,2010-09-27 23:48:00,13728,I would suggest a Honda Pilot.
507497,aplumma,2010-09-28 00:13:00,6896,you could ask T.J. what he drives... he is pretty smart.   Art
507498,Raf,2010-09-28 00:13:00,3495,"I would suggest a Jeep.  My old Cherokee currently has 400,000 on the clock and still tickin' with only a power steering pump failure in the 5+ years I've owned it and, my newer Grand Cherokee is all kinds of awesome."
507516,Fang,2010-09-28 00:53:00,1330,"My wife wanted to trade in her small Plymouth for an SUV last year. Had it narrowed down to the VW, GMC Envoy and the Cadillac SRX. I went and asked a buddy at work whose brother owns a garage in Hamilton. I was shocked about the VW. Parts are alot more expensive and many items are less than reliable. I did my own follow up on the web looking for reliable sites that would provide summary ratings on vehicles. I like the drive on the VW and the Nissan Murano but it was her choice  We went with the Envoy and she absolutley loves it. It's heavy on gas but hey I drive and Expedition  I'd vote for the Honda Pilot too but if you're asking the 4 runner"
507519,The Urban Fisherman,2010-09-28 00:58:00,2050,"I have a 2000 xterra and if I didn't have to buy a vehicle that can handle 3 kids I'd be buying another one! It's got 270,000 km's and runs like a charm!  Little to no repairs done in the life of the vehicle."
507523,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 01:03:00,5784,  hahaha. I know they are good vehicles.  Not my preference though.
507525,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 01:06:00,5784,  I know! That engine is a BEAST.
507605,Uncle Buck,2010-09-28 13:07:00,1000,"go big or go home... i didn't vote...  I know i will never buy another SUV...  an SUV is an SUV, and a truck is a truck  next set of wheels is gonna be a fullsize crewcab truck...  i currently drive a 2000 envoy V6 it has 260K on it, no major problems"
507607,BillM,2010-09-28 13:13:00,17367," Best answer yet.  The Cherokees are bulletproof, everything from the engine down to the diffs..  If you want something to get dirty and go to all the nasty places, this is it.  Also, forget fuel mileage, SUV's usually suck (Especially the Supercharged Xterra, lol)"
507609,Abraxus,2010-09-28 13:19:00,104,"The Toureg is one of the worst Consumer rated vehicles on the market.  I would highly advise looking at consumer reports and used vehicle reviews regarding the VW before you consider buying one.  They have a reputation for being huge lemons!  You cannot go wrong with Nissan or Toyota really.  I had a 2002 Nissan Pathfinder that I drove the freaking heck out of.  The motor was... and still is bullet proof!  I put over 240,000km on it before I had to sink any real money into it.  Even then...it was just maintenance and everydays ware and tear item replacements."
507652,Flappn,2010-09-28 14:33:00,245,I don't have a 2004 4runner but I do have a 1998 with 350K on it and it has been BULLET PROOF!! Other than the usual Maintenance nothing major has gone wrong. Going out to buy a new set of tires for her. She'll be good for at least another 150K. Spend your money wisely.
507665,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 15:14:00,5784," 350k that's good. If I buy a 4runner it'll probably already have 100k on it so it's good to know these things are made well and last long. I currently own an 09' Corolla and already have 91k on it. I havn't had a single issue with it, it's incredible compared to vehicles my family/friends have owned. I wasn't a fan of Toyota's in the past but you can't ignore that many happy customers. After some reading, I can see the Toureg is a breakdown waiting to happen...It's nice from a distance and I'll keep it that way. The Xterra is looking better the more I research it, I was worried about quality, but that doesn't seem to be a major issue. The main issues is gas mileage. Also it seems better off road than on. Maybe I'll look closer at the Pilot too"
507674,John,2010-09-28 15:42:00,2956," I guess the first question I would ask is why you ""may need to get an SUV""? What job are you looking for it to perform? Are you looking for a tow vehicle or just a poseur type truck..........not meant to be derogatory, just sayin'. If I only had the 3 to pick from I would choose the 4Runner, but then again given the choice out there I wouldn't buy any of the 3."
507677,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 15:52:00,5784," I need something with truck abilities as I'll be using it up north and in relatively rough terrain. I also need a covered rear end to keep stuff safe/dry and for myself as shelter. (sounds redneck I know). I'll be putting lots of hwy miles during the winter on it too so I'd like decent gas mileage and reliability. I chose these three because of the mix of real truck/ on road abilities plus the price range is right. I don't really need to tow anything (until I get a boat), but I do want a tough suv and not a ""soft-roader"". If I have a SUV I'll be using it hard.  You say you wouldn't buy any of the 3...what would you buy? (in the 15-20k price range) I'm guessing you'd pick a truck? I also like the 4 door Tacoma."
507682,John,2010-09-28 16:02:00,2956," No, I would probably buy a Jeep. If you calculate the difference in gas $$ over the course of a year it's not so much. For that kind of money you can buy a recent (3-4 year old) Grand Cherokee if you look around."
507685,Rod Caster,2010-09-28 16:07:00,5784, I'm scared poopless of chrysler products. I know the Jeeps are better built than say an Avenger but with their track record and the fact that they will probably eventually become extinct I'd rather avoid anything with a Chrysler stamp on it. The new GC is sure a nice looking SUV! I'll admit that.
507691,Harrison,2010-09-28 16:15:00,2202," Sorry to Hijack, but does this stand true for 2004 -2010 Cherokees?  I am considering one for my next ride.  I had an '87 and literally beat the snot out of it, my bro drove it til 2007 when he crashed it."
507696,Raf,2010-09-28 16:25:00,3495,"Phil, they stopped building regular Cherokees in 2001.  They replaced it with the chick mobile called the Liberty.  They still make the Grand Cherokees though.  Generations are ???-1998, 1999-2004, 2005-2010, 2011+  Rod Caster, Chrysler is not going anywhere.  The old 4.0 is bulletproof and the 4.7 has an excellent reputation as well."
507698,Harrison,2010-09-28 16:33:00,2202,"Thanks Raf, how about the Grand 1999-2004, 2005-2010 generations?  Bulletproof still?"
507703,Raf,2010-09-28 17:00:00,3495,"Powertrains will be rock-solid.  they did away with the 4.0L I6 in 2005 & replaced with a 3.7 V6 which IMO would be a dog in that chassis. In other words, get the V8.  I am more familiar with the 99-04.  The Limited models (top of the line) came with an automatic climate control system, it is about the only common source of failure on these vehicles.  The blend-doors that control cold/warm air entering the cabin will break at some point and the proper way to fix it is to pull the entire dash which is probably an 8 hour job -- there are hacks that will let you fix it by cutting plastic behind the glove box in order to gain access to replace them but they are just that, hacks.  You can avoid this issue by buying a Laredo model with manual HVAC.  http://wjjeeps.com is a great source of info for the 99-04  http://wkjeeps.com for 05-10"
