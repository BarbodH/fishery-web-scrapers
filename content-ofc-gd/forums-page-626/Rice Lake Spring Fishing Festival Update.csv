We have some teriffic sponosr's involved in this charitable event. Golden Beach Resort has generously donated a tagged fish prize valued at $4000.00. McGregor Marine in partnership with Tohatsu is sponsoring a 9.8hp outboard motor. If this tagged fish prize is not caught this new motor will be a draw prize at the end of the festival to one lucky participant. Other fantastic prizes are being offered by Southview Cottages, Plank Road Cottages, Alpine Resort, Highland View Resort, Whispering Pines cottages, Lures and Tours, Tower Manor Lodge, Ferguson's Live Bait, Lets Fish Guiding, Can Clean Services, and a $500 shopping spree at BJ Tackle in Bewdley.  We have some very worthwhile charities being featured during the three free kids fishing days (May21, 28 & June 11) and some wonderful media sponsors.  Looking forward to a fantastic festival next spring. May14-June19, 2011. This event has been designated a signature tourism event in both Peterborough and Northumberland Counties.  Plan on spending some quality time with your family and friends trying your luck at landing one of the four different species of tagged prize fish swimming around Rice Lake.  Check out the website for more information about prizes, accommodation packages, charity information and becoming involved in this charity event.  Stay tuned for more big announcements and updates.  http://www.ricelakespringfishingfestival.ca/Welcome.html"
