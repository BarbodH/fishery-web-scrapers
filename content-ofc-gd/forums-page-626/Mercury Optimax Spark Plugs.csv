(NGK # IZFR5G) They are for a 2005 Mercury Optimax (225 HP)  I picked up 6 of the regular NGK plugs from CT yesterday, but I believe I should put the Platinum plugs in it, as that is what is recommended.  I will be in Toronto today (404/finch), so if there is any place that carries them between Bowmanville - Toronto, I would be able to pop by and get them.  Thanks for any help!  *Stoty"
508141,Garnet,2010-09-30 11:10:00,2056,"Napa, CarQuest or any auto parts store can get you NGK plugs."
508143,lew,2010-09-30 11:21:00,12766,"Boatland Canada is a Merc dealer and probably has them, or can get them for you.  Hwy 115 just north east of Bowmanville"

508228,fish_fishburn,2010-09-30 17:11:00,1311,"Stoty, order some from a auto parts store that sells NGK plugs. They usually don't stock them because there not for automotive use but they are half the price of a marine dealer. But they usually make you buy the whole box (10). Then you will be stocked up for next time."

508263,fisher,2010-09-30 18:59:00,451,"I just found a website that sells plugs and it looks like it is from Canada...  http://clubplug.ca/  I searched the site for my plug which I bought at a Marina for $18+tax each about 2 months ago, and on this site, which includes free shipping, a box of 10 would only cost me $126.40 + tax.  I am so pissed that I had bought 4 for $72+tax.  PLUS if you use online coupon code 510101 - you get an additional 5% off.  Anyone else use this site in the past?  2173 BUZHW-2 NGK STANDARD PLUG / BOUGIE STANDARD 126.4 Set of 10"
508358,Stoty,2010-09-30 23:40:00,2910,"Thanks for the help guys! NAPA here in Bowmanville, has them in stock, $19 each. I just searched on the website and they are $18 each. Good price for sure, and I'll probably order from them the next time I need them.  Thanks again!"
508359,GBW,2010-09-30 23:48:00,8460,"One word ""ebay"" and it gave me a lot of sellers selling 6 for under $20."
508441,Stoty,2010-10-01 02:36:00,2910,"If you have time to wait for shipping then it's a good option... problem is...being the profession I am, I don't have time to wait. I might just order them for the future though.  Thanks again for the tips."
508533,fisher,2010-10-01 16:11:00,451,"Wow, thanks for the suggestion of using EBAY.  I just won an Ebay bid for a lot of 23 of the spark plugs that I paid $18 each for at the Marina for only $50 US which includes $10 in shipping costs.  Even with some duty - which may end up not being anything since the guy is shipping it as a ""gift"", I saved a ton of money.  At $18 each, I would have paid $414 for 23 plugs at the Marina.  Now, hopefully the motor lasts as long as my supply of plugs."
