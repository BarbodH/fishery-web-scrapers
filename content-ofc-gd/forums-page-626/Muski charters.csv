508737,Gman,2010-10-02 22:49:00,126,"You after numbers or size and a potential for a memory of a lifetime?  If numbers are what you're after, Kawarthas and St.Claire are great choices and St.Claire even has potential for a fatty.  If you're truly after a fatty I and not wanting to travel too far I would recommend Georgrian Bay, specifically Jody Mills of Mills Guide Service -  http://www.millsmuskyguideservice.ca/index.php  Good luck and have fun whatever you decide to do,,,oh yeah and happy birthday!  Cheers G."
