My editing/uploading capabilities are limited since I'm currently writing this from the back of my Jeep so that's the reason for only 2 shots...I'll try and get more uploaded in the next few days....so....enjoy!   Here's a Sow with her cub on the beach of Naknek Lake   and this one is a boar with a Sockeye Salmon "

508315,ctranter,2010-09-30 21:44:00,543,fantastic photo's Brandon.  I can't imagine how it must feel to be out there in the wild working with these bears.  Keep these amazing shots coming!
508458,Skud,2010-10-01 03:53:00,739,Sweet
508464,brandon,2010-10-01 04:56:00,857,"Thanks for all the comments!  and as far as distance from the bears...there's a law that states you cannot get within 50 yards of the bears in the park...however the bears are allowed to approach you.  It's kind of a weird loophole.  Most of the shots that I'll post were shot at 25-60 yards although we had bears sneak out of the bush 10 yards behind us while shooting.  In these situations we just step out of the way, let the bear pass, and continue shooting when it's a decent distance away.  The big thing the rangers and biologists try to get across is that we're not supposed to interfere with the natural behaviour of the bear and from what I could see, the bears were interested in only one thing - eating as much salmon as possible.  It was so cool being that close to such giant creatures..there is almost this unspoken agreement that if we don't get in their way, they won't eat us.  Not once did we have any sort of close call.  The bears there are quite used to fisherman and photographers being around so these techniques won't work with all grizzlies.  From what the rangers were saying, the bears that live elsewhere in the park aren't as forgiving and will definitely let you know if you're too close.  hope that answers the distance thing.....goodnight from the walmart parking lot in Quesnel, BC"
508470,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-01 11:05:00,2582, Just jumped on here quick to check things out before heading out to molest some Simcoe perch. Thx Roy for the morning chuckle   ...and thank you Brandon for the pics.  Great way to start my day
