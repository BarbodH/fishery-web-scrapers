508247,Muskieman,2010-09-30 18:23:00,2472,"This morning @ 10:45 I was approaching the ""Champlain Bridge"" here in Sturgeon Falls... the bridge spans about 150' across and is roughly 100' above the Sturgeon River.... traffic started to slow down because of a Whitetail Doe on the bridge....In a panic she took a leap of faith off the bridge into the river.... she didn't make it.  I proceeded to the ""docks"" to witness her floating carcass drift downstream 'til she was out of sight.  What a strange experience!   I had to share.  Randy "
508261,Rod Caster,2010-09-30 18:51:00,5784,Strange indeed. I bet you'll read about it in your local paper tomorrow.
508267,chuckymcd,2010-09-30 19:13:00,144,that is crazy
508296,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-09-30 20:53:00,1107,I saw a pic of 1 that jumped off a over pass on the 401 and landed inside a car ripped the roof right off the car on the passenger side no one but the deer got hurt. Yours would be a weird to witness that's a long drop.
508322,smally21,2010-09-30 22:14:00,993,"i read somewhere the deer had recently been depressed and had some troubles with substance abuse in the past.  earlier had jumped off a shorter bridge but this ""cry for help"" went unnoticed....."
508335,Roy,2010-09-30 23:01:00,13728,I don't think we can rule out accidental death unless the deer left a note.
508337,mercman,2010-09-30 23:04:00,7054,any long guns involved
508370,Jewelbee,2010-10-01 00:10:00,422,I picked up a buck that appeared to have taken a dive off a QEW overpass in Fort Erie once! A good find tho.. still warm and barely any damaged meat!
508393,Whitespinnerbait,2010-10-01 01:19:00,2038,I had a Doe and two fawns commit suicide right in front of me a couple of years ago . Here i am Barreling down a country road at a speed of 140 km's and the Sun of rabid dogs jumped right in front of my car......Ba Ba Bang ....
508444,Leecher,2010-10-01 02:44:00,7832,May be she knew there was too many hunters with doe tags  Kidding aside.... that's just plain crazy Randy
508448,Nipfisher,2010-10-01 02:51:00,2449,That is a long fall Randy. I witnessed something similar 2 years ago when a doe jumped off of a bridge (not as high) into the Wasi River just outside of North Bay on the hwy. to South Shore area. The river was just barely frozen and only a few feet deep in that area. We stopped to look of the edge and she was lying on/in the ice and was bleeding bad. No movement and there was nothing we could do. Felt bad but that's life I guess.
508490,jbailey,2010-10-01 13:02:00,866,i witnessed something similar a few years back on the QEW over the credit river - the cars were stopped but one jerk kept goin scared the deer and it took a leap over the side! I'm pretty sure it landed on the ground and not in the river
508500,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-01 13:39:00,0,I would have got out the fishing rod!Is it legal to snag deer meat?
508502,seaman,2010-10-01 13:46:00,11,  LOL
508505,Harrison,2010-10-01 14:03:00,2202,I am sure the buck regrets throwing his doe to the wind.
508520,fishermccann,2010-10-01 15:19:00,655,In Toronto they would build a 5 million dollar net under that bridge to stop any more from jumping!
508546,ricoboxing,2010-10-01 18:08:00,398,no they would ban bridges
508584,mercman,2010-10-01 22:08:00,7054,in montreal we would open a hotdog stand and sell tickets
508587,ctranter,2010-10-01 22:16:00,543," They would invest $1,000,000 in a commission to investigate the prevalence of bridge related deer suicides.  This will only be done if election season is coming up."
508788,wkrp,2010-10-03 02:37:00,656,OH my Deer
