Some real history on display that you won't see on the water!  http://www.cafta.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=53  Best part is, there are many ""experts"" present who can give you a history lesson on that ""old thng-a- ma-jig"" lure that was  in Grampa's tackle box! Lot's of stuff for sale as well.  These guys will also buy good stuff if you are looking to sell. GREAT idea for the kids to see what WAS. See ya there!  FT"
