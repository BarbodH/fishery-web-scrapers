508182,Rod Caster,2010-09-30 15:06:00,5784,Here are some shots of a nice walleye I got in Stoney Lake using a pink bucktail jig. Took a few pics and released it.      
508184,LucG,2010-09-30 15:10:00,779,"Nice fish! You look familiar, have you ever lived in North Bay?"
508189,bushart,2010-09-30 15:31:00,2628,Actually know lots of guys that use pink for willys in stained water
508191,Rod Caster,2010-09-30 15:39:00,5784, Yup. PM sent
508229,anders,2010-09-30 17:23:00,1168,Pink is a lethal colour up in Northern Ontario.  Nice Eye!
508233,JoshS,2010-09-30 17:47:00,729,Nice fish! Stoney is a beautiful lake
508271,Guest jaeteriusZero,2010-09-30 19:19:00,0,should've kept that one and release the smaller/bigger ones. That looks delicious.
508273,Rod Caster,2010-09-30 19:24:00,5784, It was over the slot size so I couldn't keep it. It was near 54 cms. I agree it looks delish!
508276,Muskieman,2010-09-30 19:39:00,2472,  I also thought that you looked familiar and thought that I've see you in the fishing department in Wal-Mart. I'd say 2-3 years ago.....Hmmmm small world...   very nice Pink'Eye.   Randy 
508283,Rod Caster,2010-09-30 19:47:00,5784," Very possible. I always find my way back to North Bay no matter where I live or work. That being said, I always find my way to the fishing section too!!  If anybody here makes 1/8-1/4 oz bucktail jigs please PM me. I snagged this one and have been searching for a replacement (not as easy as I thought), I'd buy 10 or 20 jigs if someone is interested."
508363,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-01 00:00:00,0,"Lots of my big eyes have come on pink jigs, especially in the winter evenings"
508422,fishinguypat,2010-10-01 01:57:00,547, Wouldn't steelhead jigs be similar to these? they usually come in pink
508438,Dave Bailey,2010-10-01 02:31:00,1641,"Nice looking fish and a good size, an unbeatable combo!    Didn't anyone ever tell you that smoking will stunt your growth? (It stunted mine but I won't tell you where...   )"
508440,Nipfisher,2010-10-01 02:34:00,2449," Randy, I'm sure you have seen me there too then.  I couldn't remember a face that I saw breifly 2-3 years ago? Besides were you looking at customers or tackle?  Rod Caster you do look familiar though. Man North Bay is a small place."
508443,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-01 02:38:00,0," I assume you were just swimming the jig?  I took the advice of a OFNer and made my own. Not sure if there is pink bucktail, but with $20 you can make 50 of them or more.  You need bucktail($6).Crazy glue($2-3) or clear nail polish(dollar store). Thread($3-4). That thing that you hold the thread in(bobinholder)($3-4). Some jig heads(varies). And a vice.  There are some great bucktail tying vids on youtube."
508447,Leecher,2010-10-01 02:49:00,7832,Beauty walleye Rod Caster Pink or chartreuse..... those two colors are a sure shot Thanks for sharing Leechman
508497,Rod Caster,2010-10-01 13:19:00,5784," I was dancing it off bottom while reeling back to shore. I keep the rod tip moving at all times...it reduces snags and taunts the walleye. Not a bad idea JohnnyB. I make my own spinners so why not my own bucktails. I'll look into those vids. I don't like calling it this, but if I tell my GF we are doing ""crafts"" she always helps out! hehe she's so sweet."
508501,seaman,2010-10-01 13:44:00,11,"  I Love Slot Sizing!!! Personally I would of put that fish back, slot size or no slot size in the area...A little big for me personally to eat...but great fish, and great release!! On a side note, in my studdies of Walleye, I have read that any larger size fish would be a female, I rarely keep any walleye over 17 inches, brecause of this!  True???....Good job Bud!!!"
508530,Guest Manitoubass,2010-10-01 15:53:00,0, Add black to that list as well
508531,Rod Caster,2010-10-01 15:57:00,5784," Ahh you caught me. It's a 20cms Walleye...I'm only 4 foot 2""."
508580,cheaptackle,2010-10-01 21:34:00,849,"Hey pal - you should let your buddy know when you need tackle, never know what I got up my sleeve! Just so happens.....   Michael"
508585,Rod Caster,2010-10-01 22:13:00,5784,  I like the sounds of that I'll stop in this weekend.
508630,Moosebunk,2010-10-02 02:03:00,3970,Used to tie alot of pink hair jigs.  Pink and pink/white.  Favorite color jig when living up north and responsible for some of the best walleye and searun specks.  Nice fish.  You proved the color works for you too.
508641,Muskieman,2010-10-02 02:42:00,2472,  While you're there look for your name on the wall and an OFC Hat   Randy 
508730,cheaptackle,2010-10-02 22:29:00,849," It's still there and he's been there too.  His ""stuff"" is on the wall.  When you coming again?  Maybe I'll print yours on the computer this time instead of using my crayons Michael"
