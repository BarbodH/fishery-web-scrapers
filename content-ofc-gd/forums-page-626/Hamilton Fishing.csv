508777,stasbrute,2010-10-03 01:41:00,206,`steal your (walleye) face`......nice.....
508898,fishing_noob,2010-10-03 18:42:00,12,anyone know any good spots for bass at bay front park? also im not one of those people that disrespect the shore and throw fishing line and worm containers everywhere
508963,Duckie,2010-10-04 00:00:00,305,"pretty much anywhere along that whole bayfront shoreline is good for bass.  in the summer when it gets weedy, I have caught many using a frog popper type bait like the Rapala Skitter Pop."
507797,tknohpy,2010-09-28 23:46:00,162,Hey Guys and Gals  I have moved to Hamilton recently.  I am at my trailer on Hay Bay April to October but am looking for places to fish November to March.  Any suggestions are appreciated.
507804,dave524,2010-09-28 23:59:00,4508,Niagara River
507849,Guest LivingLegend,2010-09-29 01:50:00,0,"Good choice Dave yet not that close to Hamilton, I know there are some nice trials back in the bay there but not to sure about fishing around there. Give us a report if you have any luck."
507885,The JAY,2010-09-29 12:35:00,239,"November to May... You're probably looking at ice fishing down at Pier 4 or in that area. I usually put away the gear over that time, but maybe ice fishing won't be that bad....  Never tried it, but buddies are bugging me to try it with them.  I think I remember seeing folks at the dam in Caledonia during that stretch, but others can probably tell you for sure. Welcome to the Hammer!"
507898,Uncle Buck,2010-09-29 13:32:00,1000,"lots in the area or close surroundings...  bayfront park, la salle park, pier 4, pier 8, binbrook conservation area, grand river, port Dalhousie...  lots of opportunities near by"
507927,tknohpy,2010-09-29 15:35:00,162,what species are you fishing for in those areas?
507934,uglyfish,2010-09-29 16:24:00,981,"Perch, crappie, bluegills pike, walleye, trout"
507959,Spiel,2010-09-29 18:09:00,9065,I'm sure this won't help you much but most of my friends here in Hamilton head to the BOQ November through March.
507971,tknohpy,2010-09-29 20:11:00,162,i will be making trips every couple of weeks myself
508012,Gerritt,2010-09-29 23:28:00,6129,As Spiel already stated. But welcome to Hamilton! Where abouts?
508014,tknohpy,2010-09-29 23:35:00,162,on the mountain off Mohawk near Ancaster
508018,vinnimon,2010-09-30 00:04:00,2593,"  Welcome to the hammer, neighbour! Like others have said,theres tons of places to hit!Within a 1/2 hrs drive! FYI theres a little restaurant at mohawk and magnolia(at the plaza) that recently opened up,I here their fish and chips are really good!Yet to try it myself! Heres a little teaser for ya,thats if your into ice fishing!"
508019,Gerritt,2010-09-30 00:05:00,6129,"on the mountain too! perhaps we can get out for a fish together,  G"
508020,tknohpy,2010-09-30 00:09:00,162,That would be great!  I fish mainly for walleye all year so new experiences would be good
508026,solopaddler,2010-09-30 00:28:00,8605, Screw that. Everyone come to my place for beers.
508027,smally21,2010-09-30 00:31:00,993,"im in the hamilton area as well. day trips are usually to lake erie, but ive done all the local conservations and such. check the GRCA website and the niagara region site for locations. i dont have much faith in the conservation areas - just my experience.  lots of sunfish thru the ice.  i fish the harbour and burlington bay a few times just to get out.  maitland and nanticoke are pretty close.  welcome to the hammer."
508043,Loonietoon,2010-09-30 01:01:00,1450,Pick a time I'm sure a few of us will make it
508045,vinnimon,2010-09-30 01:09:00,2593,"  3 2 1 knock, knock!"
508052,solopaddler,2010-09-30 01:14:00,8605," Will do, let me think on it."
508054,smally21,2010-09-30 01:17:00,993,my garage is always open for fishing stories.  the BBQ might be goin' as well.
508056,danbouck,2010-09-30 01:18:00,4380,I'll be in Hamilton that day!

508081,danbouck,2010-09-30 01:54:00,4380,I usually give it away for free but that sounds good too!
508216,Loonietoon,2010-09-30 16:45:00,1450,this could get interesting...YES
508253,Steve,2010-09-30 18:33:00,2075,"Grateful Fisher, clearly we have something in common .... gotta luv the wall of sound!  Anyways, lots of advice for ice fishing. Give me a PM on QF.net.  I fish open water all fall, winter, and spring long....not interesting in fishing on the ice.  Lots of good open water fishing around here in the winter....but ya gotta bundle up!"
