171211,outdoorguy61,2008-03-14 02:10:00,220,"Knockoffs and copys have been going on since before fishing tackle went big....post WW2. There has also been an equally age old item whereby, a large vender like BPS is able to get a manufacturer to build an item at their specs. in order to control margin and separate markets. Has anyone noted the package by chance? This can often speak volumes if one reads through it carefully.  outdoorguy61"
171230,danc,2008-03-14 02:50:00,4677, BPS loves guys like you Bill.
171252,muskymike,2008-03-14 03:50:00,772," See here is my issue. I dont have a problem with the Generic brands although for Spoons, I think Eppinger makes the best, there is just something about the action that is slightly different and I will gladly pay the difference when/if I ever buy another.  But the 6"" Grubs, I was confused. I know a lot of people that buy them and the guy told me they just didnt fit in. But you can go down their Musky aisle and pick up (cant remember the make) but they are $16 for 2.  I find the Power Grubs or Magnum Grubs if you will, work a lot better. I have to search for them and I pick them up whenever I find them. The Creme/White seem to work the best for me.  They need to keep both, offer both, dont discontinue one. Offer variety and people will pay.  ie. if there were a section of Pink Lures, I would have to buy my girlfriend something every time I am there. Thank god they dont carry fishergirl yet hahaha"
171255,livinisfishin,2008-03-14 04:25:00,661,Atleast their knockoffs actually resemble a decent lure not something that was pulled out of chinas ass like half of the qualityless products.
171278,Whopper,2008-03-14 10:51:00,2174,Geesssh the nerve of BPS  Is it time to start fishing yet?  Better yet I think I'll go spend some of my money there today
171282,Rich,2008-03-14 11:12:00,3927,"This post is hilarious. Umm.. gee why would they put their knock off cheap product right beside the real thing? Guess you've never been to any store anywhere, because right next to the name brands is usually ""No Name"" or something of that sort of the same product, and usually it's just as good and way cheaper."
171298,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-14 11:46:00,2585,"since i sell retail i know a bit about things like this.  In some cases brands actually do the private label product for retailers.  So the bass pro shop brands could very well be the same product as berkley, strike king etc.... and its just in a different package.  I know bass pro shop, walmart, ctc, homedepot, lowes, homehardware all do this.  It helps promote there business.  And yes sometimes it is product made offshore that they can sell at higher margin, but alot of cases its for there promotional benifit more then profit.  Cheers!"
171302,pikehunter,2008-03-14 11:59:00,1659,Cabin Fever! It is getting hold of us all. Guess these threads are helping to keep the board up and running and are providing some entertainment.  Quit complaining. Knock offs have been around forever and will continue to be. Just be happy that there is a selection to choose from. Where would you like them to display the knock off Cleos? Over in the womens clothing section? Now that would be embarrassing for you and the ladies!
171303,Mark Kulik,2008-03-14 11:59:00,348,"I was going to say the same thing as LBH  quite often a company like Bass Pro will get Acme to make its own line of lures often cheaper $  , so it's good for the consumer, although when something is less pricey we tend to think it;s not as good, I used to be a packaging mechanic at Christie Bakery in To. My line was the premium cracker line, every now and then we would run a private label like Sobey's brand of cracker, which would be cheaper than ours, yet I would have people tell me they aren't as good tasting?? so that is probably the reason."
171308,Spiel,2008-03-14 12:08:00,9065,....T'is a strange world we live in.
171178,JustinHoffman,2008-03-14 00:47:00,482,"Wow - I sometimes just have to shake my head..  Instead of being happy that a store keeps it's ""like-branded"" stuff in the same place for ease of shopping and less running around - it becomes an issue.  Instead of being happy that a store actually gives you variations on the ""same"" product in order for you to take part in comparison shopping - it becomes an issue.  Instead of being happy that a retailer gives you the ""option"" to buy a similar-styled bait or lure for less of a cost - it becomes an issue.  Look around - there are generic makes and models for everything we consume in our society today. And we should be thankful for that. I certainly don't want to live in a place where a monopoly on my spending money is dictated and controlled.  I guess I become a little agitated when it becomes the ""norm"" and ""in vogue"" to rant and complain about every minute detail in our lives today. And when the complaint is completely unfounded and unnecessary, well, it kind of becomes a sad commentary on our society in this internet age...  Be thankful we are given a choice - many countries don't allow their citizens that pleasure..  Just my 2-cents worth.  Good Fishing,  Justin"
171183,mepps,2008-03-14 00:56:00,1301,Most of the Cabelas and BPS items are exactly the same as the offical items.  I dont mind saving a buck or two and using a knockoff.
171191,OhioFisherman,2008-03-14 01:08:00,6623,"You do have to consider that some companies know the original patent holder may not have the funds to fight a patent infringement case, which can drive competition out of business?  For countries it is the same, the largest counterfeiter of the US 100 dollar bill is reportedly sponsored by the government of North Korea. We might have to borrow money from China to fight that one!"
171202,danc,2008-03-14 01:40:00,4677,"  Chances are that the BPS lure is the exact same lure that is in the Cleo package. Do you think that BPS has a lure making, rod making, reel making, clothing making factory? Well, no they don't. Their buying power enables them to put their own name on products. You can pay a premium for the original brand names, or appreciate a steep discount for buying the same thing with a BPS tag on it. Your choice. I don't shop at BPS but I take advantage of this scenario from Cabelas frequently. If your rod or reel must say Loomis or Shimano on it, by all means pay the premium. If you don't mind having the same product that says Cabelas or BPS on it, be prepared to pay half the price, or less. And most likely with a better warranty to boot."
171203,BillM,2008-03-14 01:40:00,17367,"I picked up a few little Cleo's only to notice they were BPS Little Leo's...   Like come on, atleast find an original name for your baits instead of trying to sell them because of another manufacturers reputation.  I put them back."
