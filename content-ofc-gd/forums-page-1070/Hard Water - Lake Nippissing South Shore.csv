Friday afternoon showed very nice weather, so we fished outdoors and enjoyed the sunshine. Saturday the weather took a drastic change with temperatures around -30c with the wind chill and the winds were blowing between 70-80kmph. Not very nice for a day that was suppost to be -5c and sunny. We sat in the hut all day Saturday had a few refreshments and told all kinds of war stories (some fishing stories as well, but Iam not too sure about the story of the 60lb Musky). The fishing was very poor and we ended up with one jumbo perch, a dozen normal small perch, three mud puppies, one pickerl (in slot size and had to put back), and one small cisco. All in all the company was as good as the food, even though the fishing was not.  Cheers,  OlTroll"
