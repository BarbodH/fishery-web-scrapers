171141,Spiel,2008-03-13 23:39:00,9065, Not all of us have a choice.
171153,ccmtcanada,2008-03-14 00:03:00,7971," Yeah, well, I suppose it's an occupational hazard to you...hehe."
171156,lazybum,2008-03-14 00:06:00,142," Peter, you have just added a whole new meaning to ""fly-fishing""   ."
171229,ozaibak1,2008-03-14 02:49:00,401,Umm ever heard of the San Jose Sharks? Thats close enough of a relationship for me.
171253,muskymike,2008-03-14 04:00:00,772,"Okay I think there is a glitch on the system, Dan The Man's avatar is of the Canadians....montreal has good bagels, fishing and winter activities, but as for a hockey team, hmmm I cant say they are good.  hahahaha sorry since this is a fishing post i thought i would throw my thoughts in  GO LEAFS GO (we are not making the playoffs but we will look good for 10 games at least hahahah)"
171254,jnic,2008-03-14 04:17:00,158,if it says non fishing don't open it. go flames go
171270,Dano,2008-03-14 09:46:00,719," Yea you do, there is always choice...."
171276,ChrisK,2008-03-14 10:19:00,2772,"I don't know about you guys but one thing pops into mind when I think of fishing and hockey....Heritage..except one thing is missing,hunting  ..its all part of our Canadian heritage...  Cheers !!!"
170311,silveradosheriff,2008-03-12 13:32:00,1025,If you don't like hockey posts - you could always starting a knitting thread....
170315,ketchenany,2008-03-12 13:58:00,3229,What's wrong with a bit of ICEFISHING?  Golf Leafs Golf
170317,perodimi,2008-03-12 13:59:00,124,"Fellow Fishermen / Fisherwomen,  I've jumped in here a few times and actually find it very interesting to see and get to know the backgrounds and interests of everybody on this forum. I find myself visiting often especially on layovers abroad. When topics have swayed toward aviation for instance, I'm happy to jump in with absolutely no intent of offending anyone or undermining the primary existence of the forum. Hockey isn't my bag so I don't go there.  Getting to know one another amidst this long winter is a wonderful way to pass the time as we collectively wait to get our boats in the water. I apologize if some threads go awry and off topic but let's all remember that everyone here loves to fish!  Here's a picture of the North Pole on the way to the Orient. All I could think about is if anyone ever fished there:    Cheers!  Peter"
170322,pigeonfisher,2008-03-12 14:17:00,696,you have a nice seat!!!
170327,Kirk,2008-03-12 14:28:00,347,Most men like fishing. Most men like hockey and other sports. Most ice huts have hockey game broadcasts. Can't think of a better link.
170333,ehg,2008-03-12 14:34:00,2666,"Just wait until May, June, July etc.... the fishing posts almost border on overkill.  Johnny Bass will make a re-appearence as well!  You'll be praying for non- fishing posts at that time."
170334,irishfield,2008-03-12 14:35:00,26272,"So Roy... was this the Rant you were waiting for, or are they out of sequence now?"
170336,Roy,2008-03-12 14:40:00,13728," We're right on target, Wayne. I said this one would arrive either last night or today. I was pretty close at 12:53 AM"
170341,Whopper,2008-03-12 14:45:00,2174, Nah I got one boiling Wayne   That's funny right there.   
170355,shane,2008-03-12 15:07:00,652,I think we should separate the NF rants from the fishing rants.   
170361,pikehunter,2008-03-12 15:13:00,1659,"   I almost ticked my pants on that one Ha Ha, there goes the auto censor again!"
170362,Roy,2008-03-12 15:13:00,13728,We can't do that Fireball. Some smartalec will post a fishing picture in a NF rant and it'll confuse the moderators.
170364,pikehunter,2008-03-12 15:16:00,1659,There ya go Roy LOL 
170365,ccmtcanada,2008-03-12 15:18:00,7971,"This is a fishing forum?  Ahh man, I wondered why I'd see pics of fish all the time.  I got lost somewhere on the information superhighway looking for an aquarium maintenance forum."
170368,LeXXington,2008-03-12 15:38:00,1928,How long till Spring
170388,Squid,2008-03-12 16:19:00,1656,I have a rant just waitng to go...April 1st 12.01AM
170556,danc,2008-03-12 22:01:00,4677,I love this thread..
170559,ccmtcanada,2008-03-12 22:06:00,7971, OOS fish pics?  Tiller/console?  Walleye/Pickeral? Photoshop? Snagging fish?  Or do ya have a new one??
170587,TJQ,2008-03-12 23:09:00,7806, Funny dude!
170598,crappieperchhunter,2008-03-12 23:32:00,2582,A source of mine told me that this board will have a seperate fishing and none fishing forum...after the LEAFS win the cup!!!
170643,wvfisherman,2008-03-13 01:04:00,34,"I have been reading this board for a while and have made a post myself which may not be directed toward fishing, but  fishing is what  bonds or holds us together on this board. I have found out that most of us are interested in each others interest and if someone has a problem or concern there is alway someone to be there to support them and encourage them.  So if it is about hockey, your new pet, your new boat or if you need prayers for a friend or family we are there, so I vote to keep the board as it is.  We are all fishermen (women).  If we don't want to read a posting we can just skip it and go on to the next posting."
170701,DanTheMan,2008-03-13 02:01:00,257,  LOL
170904,Squid,2008-03-13 15:23:00,1656,
170929,ricoboxing,2008-03-13 16:36:00,398,No offence but what does this thread have to do with fishing?
171073,hillbilly,2008-03-13 22:22:00,14,we all choose weather or not to read people's posts and if you dont like the topic don't read it.  hillbilly
170227,Stern Rules,2008-03-12 04:53:00,342,No offence but what does hockey have to do with fishing?
170228,huntervasili,2008-03-12 04:55:00,1604,Well he put (NF-Non fishing) and not everything on the community always relates to fishing...but yes it is a fishing board to answer your question
170234,jediangler,2008-03-12 05:30:00,1923,Fish play hockey. 
170237,caper,2008-03-12 07:22:00,210,Maybe there should be a poll about having fishing and non fishing sections..
170238,brifishrgy,2008-03-12 08:27:00,559,hockey and fishing have alot in common actually .. your ultimate goal is to get as many in the net as you can
170240,DanTheMan,2008-03-12 09:55:00,257,
170241,Riparian,2008-03-12 09:59:00,269,I personally dont find it any inconvenience to see a non fishing thread...  not sure why it upsets people?
170244,Terry,2008-03-12 10:42:00,14456,"every year someone complains about non fishing threads and having a different section for non fishing threads  and there are some other sections...m  but the day to day chat about peoples daily life and problems and what interests them is what makes this message board different then other boards and IMHO makes it the best board out there.....  if you like it great join in if you don't  like it, learn to live with it if you can't take it......you know where  the door is...but we never lock the door so you are welcome back  ...well I guess it has been locked for a few people..........."
170245,Dondorfish,2008-03-12 10:50:00,1000,   Well said Terry - and pretty much how I feel   Don
170246,Spiel,2008-03-12 10:59:00,9065,....Be thankful that you at least have the option of not reading them.
170249,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-12 11:09:00,2585,yes every year this tread comes up lol  dont like it?  dont read it.  Soon open water season will be here and all will be right in the OFC world lol  Cheers!
170253,lew,2008-03-12 11:20:00,12767,"Go back and read thru the pages of this forum and you'll find some of  our longest & most interesting discussions ever, have had absolutely nothing to do with fishing or fishing related subjects.......jeeeeeez, even old Chuck Norris got 35 responses for his birthday"
170261,pikehunter,2008-03-12 11:45:00,1659,As Terry and Lew said.
170265,Roy,2008-03-12 11:48:00,13728,Not to mention all those great non fishing related pictures of New Brunswick and Maine that you posted here. It's just the way it is here. Folks share things but a lot of it happens to be fishing related.  Glad you got this one out of the way though. Only two rants left before trout opening.
170266,Greencoachdog,2008-03-12 11:54:00,8163,Is that little black thing they hit with the sticks really a frozen Moose turd?
170267,Big Cliff,2008-03-12 11:54:00,6899,"Actually, no it isn't a fishing board. It is a community of people from many walks of life, with many different intrests.  Our common bond is fishing and looking out for each other. While many ""fishing boards"" come and go, this board just continues to grow. Stick around for a while; it'll grow on you!"
170274,kennyman,2008-03-12 12:16:00,737,"Well said Cliff . That makes me feel like I'm part of a family here. It's funny I've only ever met a couple guys from the board, but I feel like I know some of you. Maybe some day I'll get to see you guys LOL.It seems many of you have more time off and yes,I'm jealous as hell  . P.S. About the hockey, I bleed blue and white. Yes it's a sickness. I can't help it. I need my hockey fix almost as much as my fishing fix and being it's winter,it's hockey time. I also spend my spare time in the winter time trying to learn more about fishing.Goodness knows, I need all the help I can get   This board has a nice mix of everything and some members who really know how to fish,are willing to help and trash talk the Leafs. You gotta love it."
170275,jughead,2008-03-12 12:17:00,92,"It's not like hockey threads are replacing fishing threads, one doesn't negate the other. There are as many fishing threads as people post, having non-fishing threads removed isn't going to increase the number of fishing threads so pass them by and read what strikes your fancy"
170281,TOM C,2008-03-12 12:24:00,76,"What annoys me is that people keep calling what Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal do HOCKEY"
170282,Beans,2008-03-12 12:26:00,3339,"How cum it is always the guys with just a few posts under their belt are the ones that want separate forums for each subject ?  I go on various boards that do just that and rarely read any more than one forum...  Spiel said it best...don't like the subject don't read the thread...  When out fishing, my friends and I discuss many things besides fishing...no different here...  After you have a couple thousand posts under your belt come back and see if you still feel the same...those oldtimers know what they are talking about (most of the time)..."
170287,Cory,2008-03-12 12:40:00,170," Chuck Norris took a picture of Lew, and Lew smiled"
170289,lew,2008-03-12 12:45:00,12767,
170296,pigeonfisher,2008-03-12 12:54:00,696,Chuck Norris stopped on the side of the road in Peterborough for a pee.  The result is the Kawartha Lakes.  Might also explain the carp die - off
170301,Tinman,2008-03-12 13:16:00,376,"  With the excpetion of toronto, ottawa is clinging to the play offs and montreal is in first!  I think its great that everyone post things on different subjects. The definintion of community is  1: a unified body of individuals: as a: state, commonwealth b: the people with common interests living in a particular area; broadly : the area itself <the problems of a large community> c: an interacting population of various kinds of individuals (as species) in a common location d: a group of people with a common characteristic or interest living together within a larger society <a community of retired persons> e: a group linked by a common policy f: a body of persons or nations having a common history or common social, economic, and political interests <the international community> g: a body of persons of common and especially professional interests scattered through a larger society <the academic community> 2: society at large3 a: joint ownership or participation <community of goods> b: common character : likeness <community of interests> c: social activity : fellowship d: a social state or condition  Kinda sounds like us. When someone is haveing a rough time, they get some of the support they need here. Advice on repairs, you get it here. Product information sharing, you get it here. Rib your buddy about the hockey team they cheer for  Everyone looking after one another in some way, fits into the definition of community don't ya think?   Cheers Guys and Gals!  Denis"
170307,muskymike,2008-03-12 13:23:00,772,Lew......Chuck is watching you and can hear what you say about him   BE CAREFUL...
