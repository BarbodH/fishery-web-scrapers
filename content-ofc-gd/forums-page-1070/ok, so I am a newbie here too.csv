171040,Canuck2fan,2008-03-13 21:35:00,1444,"Welcome Splashopper....  My name is Canuck2fan and I am a fishing addict....  How you will know you have the dreaded disease of fishing addiction is when you base your tiling price quotes on how many reels it will purchase.  Or it might simply be when you offer your wife a deal she can have that shoe closet when you get an equal sq footage for a fishing gear storage room....  Also if you have more than 4 Steelhead rods and are actively looking for more take warning.  If you sole criteria for purchasing a new vehicle is if it will hold all your gear, your fishing buddies and tow the boat that would be a sign...  The signs are many but by being on here you will find out how to deal with all."

171053,splashhopper,2008-03-13 21:56:00,2931,"canuck2fan: I might already be in trouble then: 1: i already own two sets of reels and rods.. 2: i try to coordinate jobs on Fridays( or not) that end by noon. 3: My wife thinks i was a much happier guy while i was still fishing... she sees no change in me talking with my new fishing friends! 4: My daughters ask me what i am gonna do with the 5k worth of golf gear I own and i immediately start thinking, maybe i could trade soem of it for soem kind of fishing gear. 5: My youngest daughter notes i already have my fishing FOLDER on this laptop loaded with links. 6: I am talking about the last rainbow i caught, IN MY SLEEP ! 7: I have a new prayer already cooked up "" please fishing gods, pleeeeeze let me at least get a hit today"""
171058,ccmtcanada,2008-03-13 22:05:00,7971," This boat only cost me $2300 (including 18hp motor and trailer).....5,000 could go a LONG way, PLUS get you some other fishing equipment......LOL.  See...making you think aren't I??? LOL.  "

171199,Radnine,2008-03-14 01:31:00,1538,"Welcome aboard Slashhopper! It sounds like you’ve carved out a nice existence for yourself. As a 13.7 handicapper let me offer this tidbit; there are loads of bad days on the golf course, in fact you can make an argument that everyday you don’t birdie every hole, is a bad day. But there is no such thing as a bad day of fishing. They just don’t happen. You are going to love this group. Jim"
170661,splashhopper,2008-03-13 01:29:00,2931,"As has been noted by the other two new guys today, I also just joined this site and am very impressed by the forthcoming support.  The comradery is refreshing and i love fearing all the ""tall tales"" with soem amazing pics to go with them too.  I am a self employed contractor in London,ON specializing in grout and tile restoration. >> www.TheGroutDoctor.ca  The fishing bug hit me real bad last summer when I caught a large mouth bass, ON MY HOME GOLF COURSE in Clinton. It was about 3.5 lbs and was released as well. The course owner lets members bring their kids to the big pon on a catch and release(with permission) basis.  One of my golf buddies is also an avid fishermen and he got me started on the Maitland River last fall going for Rainbows.  My chat name comes from him. More will be revealed, some day.  I am a blessed guy to have a wife that ENCOURAGES me to golf and fish, so i don;t get so cranky in the fall! lol I have two beautiful daughters ( 10 year old is the 2007 Canadian Junior NATIONAL Black belt Taekwando champion and my18 yr old is in first yr University at Western)  I am also graced to belong to a group of men and women that are ""Friends of Bill W"" for the past 17 yrs.  Now, for the fishing bug, I have only caught small mouth bass and rainbows in the river and have caught some walleye on the lake(Huron and Erie) while out on charters over the past 10 years.  So, my question for all is:  Is this sport gonna be as addictive as golf has been for me, and how will iknow when i wil lneed to go to ""fishermens anonymous"" or some kind of treatment centre for fishing addicts? LOL   Thanks for this site.. I watch it every night.  Splashopper"

(I'm a Western Alumni...LOL).  It's great to have a supportive wife as well.  My wife, Bly on the board, has the fishing bug as much as I do...and she regularly outfishes me too, so we get out a few hundred times a year.  Rainbows on the Maitland...I'd love to head there one day.  Anyhow, welcome to the board...hope you enjoy your stay here!"

170818,ccmtcanada,2008-03-13 12:58:00,7971, Yep...you've taken the first step towards addiction by registering on this site.... 
170826,jediangler,2008-03-13 13:16:00,1923,Welcome. Yes it's very addictive. Soon you'll be talking your buddies into skipping golf for fishing trips.
170844,lazybum,2008-03-13 13:54:00,142,"Welcome aboard.  Pretty soon your daily routine will end up like   fishing in the morning, golfing in the afternoon, grouting in the evening, hanging out   on OFC at night."

171007,Big Cliff,2008-03-13 20:45:00,6899,"Welcome to the board!  Oh, and to answer your question ""Is this sport gonna be as addictive as golf has been for me, and how will iknow when i wil lneed to go to ""fishermens anonymous"" or some kind of treatment centre for fishing addicts? LOL""  Well, lets see; you have already figured out that you can fish on a golf course but you can't golf in a fishing hole. Fisher(persons) anonymous is not like any other ""anonymous"" group out there, we like being addicted, if you try to quit, we'll take you fishing and have some fun until you come to your senses. Our success rate is better than any other support group since we only have one step to worry about, the one from the dock into the boat, once you are in the boat, nothing else matters!  Anyway, sit back, relax, and enjoy, you have just become a member of a pretty good family!"
171009,Clampet,2008-03-13 20:48:00,1947,"Welcome aboard, hope you enjoy your stay!"
171024,Rich Clemens,2008-03-13 21:18:00,3131,Welcome aboard spashhopper.    That sounds kinda neat fishing on the gold course.   Take a swing - make a cast.
171025,splashhopper,2008-03-13 21:19:00,2931,Big Cliff: Your tag line says >> There is a fine line between fishing and sitting in a boat and looking stupid!<<  How am i gonna know when I am looking stupid?  I already got a dumb chatname from my fishing buddies !  What's next?  lol
171026,splashhopper,2008-03-13 21:20:00,2931,ty for welcome guys. 
171028,ccmtcanada,2008-03-13 21:22:00,7971, This is looking stupid....I thought I had a salmon in this pic....not a boat per se....it's a canoe. 
171031,Big Cliff,2008-03-13 21:26:00,6899,"Well LOL, if you are sitting in a boat without a   in your hand, you'll look STUPID LOL. Don't worry, we have a cure for that, someone will hand you a rod!"
171032,splashhopper,2008-03-13 21:28:00,2931,"Rich: It IS fun catching the bass..  We feed them the dew worms we find in the early morning dew as well. And sometimes, if we find a frog that got smoked by the grasscutting machines, we will feed the bass those too. What a blast to watch the bass cream a frog BEFORE it even hits the water!"
171033,splashhopper,2008-03-13 21:31:00,2931,"ccm: that fish looks like some of the food I ate at my late mother-in-laws( Filipina lady) house on a sunday night.  I thought it was only ""caught"" in the freezer section at the fish and seafood store in Scarborough..  I looked EXACTLY like you do in that pic when my brother in laws asked me ""why"" I wasn't eating the shrimp HEADS TOO! geesh"
