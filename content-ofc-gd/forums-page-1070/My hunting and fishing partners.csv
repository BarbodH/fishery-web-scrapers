I have taken the older son out 4 times so far this year on the lake near home,and he likes it, but gets cold quick unless he is running around with the dog, but that is ok home is only minutes away on the 4 wheeler. We will be going out this weekend to get some perch for a fish fry. Hopefully will have some pics of some fish for Monday.  Stay safe out there  "
