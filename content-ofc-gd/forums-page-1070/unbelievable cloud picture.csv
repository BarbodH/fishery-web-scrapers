170955,JohnF,2008-03-13 17:55:00,3494," Looks like a scene from a sci-fi movie, the part where the music gets very ominous and the extra-terrestrial invader ships are about to lower through the cloud bank.  JF"
170958,irishfield,2008-03-13 17:58:00,26272,"Dang.. must be a warm front coming, 'cause it sure doesn't look like a cold front."
170972,Cory,2008-03-13 18:23:00,170,"I had a stiff neck this morning.  Thought it was from standing outside staring up at the clouds, but then I remembered I took a Viagra and didnâ€™t swallow it quick enough."
170997,Ramble,2008-03-13 20:10:00,713,Awesome picture. I've tried to get a shot of those the past 2 summers but couldnt quite pull it off. I usually see them  right before rain as well.  -R-
170998,bpsbassman,2008-03-13 20:17:00,941,Awesome pic Lew. I really enjoy looking at cloud patterns from above the clouds when up in a plane.  It really is amazing how nature has such intricate patterns.
171019,Joey,2008-03-13 21:03:00,9122," Cory, Cory, Cory, only you could come up with that"
171022,Rich Clemens,2008-03-13 21:17:00,3131,Very unique indeed Lew.   Cool pic.
170850,lew,2008-03-13 14:03:00,12767,I took this picture of some very odd looking clouds from my backyard about 20 minutes ago and thought some may find it interesting. Guess it was a lucky shot as the shape had totally disappeared within a couple minutes.  Or am I the only one that finds this interesting ??  
170853,TJQ,2008-03-13 14:04:00,7806,Looks ominous!   (big word for me... had to try it out!)
170854,muskymike,2008-03-13 14:05:00,772,"No Lew, that is pretty interesting thats for sure.  I am in Mississauga right now and they dont look anything like that.  Great picture. I dont think we will ever see clouds like that again."
170859,jediangler,2008-03-13 14:09:00,1923,Cool! Looks like a bunch of cotton balls all lined up.
170860,John,2008-03-13 14:09:00,2956,"That's really cool Lew. I'll leave the big words to TJ, he has a bigger thesaurus"
170861,ccmtcanada,2008-03-13 14:09:00,7971,"Hey Lew,  That is a  Mammatus cloud type I believe.  They are pretty cool looking!  Here's an excerpt from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammatus)  Mammatus (also known as mammatocumulus, meaning ""bumpy clouds)is a meteorological term applied to a cellular pattern of pouches hanging underneath the base of a cloud. The name ""mammatus"" is derived from the Latin mamma (breast), due to the resemblance between the shape of these clouds and human female breasts."
170866,lew,2008-03-13 14:18:00,12767," Thanks Cliff, but I think TJ's explanation was easier to understand"
170869,shane,2008-03-13 14:19:00,652,"Wow!  You're really lucky to see that, and then to get a picture as well!  I've seen pictures of clouds kind of like those but I don't remember what they were called.  Something  relating to mammaries I think.   Isn't there a meteorology science type person on here? He would likely know.  Nice catch!"
170870,johnnyb,2008-03-13 14:22:00,3413,"yes...mammatus!  All I could think was mimosa, for some reason.  I always thought these clouds showed up before a big downpour....nice shot!"
170871,Roy,2008-03-13 14:23:00,13728," So, are there enough chiropractors in East York to handle the neck sprains for the next day or two?"
170876,shane,2008-03-13 14:27:00,652,HAHA!  Cliff got it before me.  I have to learn to type type faster.
170879,shane,2008-03-13 14:29:00,652,"Holy cow, you guys are fast!  I feel like a Leafs goalie!"
170880,lew,2008-03-13 14:30:00,12767," Actually johnnyb, were getting snow pellets falling right now and then rain is forecast for later today......good call"
170884,bullybass,2008-03-13 14:40:00,144,mmmmm booby clouds 
170886,LeXXington,2008-03-13 14:42:00,1928,Someone up staires is driving a snowmobile leaving tracks
170893,Joey,2008-03-13 15:04:00,9122,"   I've seen those clouds before, and ususally they do precipitate a storm.  Cool Pic Lew.  Joey"
170898,Badger Shark,2008-03-13 15:13:00,291,"Yep Cliff, you are correct, they are mammatus clouds.  You see them more often in the summer usually when there is bad weather around.  I used to see these all the time when I lived in Kansas.  Sometimes they would be green in colour and that is never a good sign.  Whenever the clouds would turn green we would take cover because it usually meant there was a tornado around.  But as luck would have it we never did have one.  All that time in Kansas (10yrs) and never saw one tornado, I have been back in Canada for 16yrs and have seen 2.  Really cool pic Joey, thanks for posting it."
170899,Fisherman,2008-03-13 15:17:00,7201,Upside down cinnamon bums. Where's the icing??
