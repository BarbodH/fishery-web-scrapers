The week there was the beginning to discovering the area for myself about a dozen times since.  In front of the lodge is some REAL deep water with Rainbows & lakers, Smallmouth just about everywhere there is a shoal. Northerns in the weedy bays.  In many ways the potential up there is untapped. Good Luck!"

They took out a few people for pike fishing and did very well. I did ask them for some general ideas for fishing spots they gave me some very vague locations like over there around the bend. I can't blame them as that is their livelyhood. I did manage to find fish pretty easily and did hook up with some trout and smallies. Overall nice lodge great food ( the owner is a chef) and very good fishing. I do plan to go back there, but not sure if I will go in the spring or the fall.  Hope you get the job, let me know how you do!  Rob C"
