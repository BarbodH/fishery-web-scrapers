170381,silveradosheriff,2008-03-12 15:59:00,1025,"Well, I've been able to negotiate a nice budget for tackle this year, but not without a trade-off.  The water where I live is very hard (no, not ice) and I'm looking for advice on which water softener to purchase. Budget is not an issue.  Thanks,  Rod."
170382,ccmtcanada,2008-03-12 16:00:00,7971,Move into a smaller house with soft water and increase your tackle budget!!  Sorry...couldn't resist!
170383,silveradosheriff,2008-03-12 16:05:00,1025,I'm going to need to put an addition on the house....just for the tackle!!!
170390,wallyboss,2008-03-12 16:22:00,1095,"Call Culligan man in your area.  Your water might have other minerals in it, that a regular softener will not take care of. Call Culligan and you can rent a softener/conditioner from them and still have lots left over in your fishing Budget."
170543,silveradosheriff,2008-03-12 21:51:00,1025,OK - Culligan Man gets a call.....who else?
170549,fishing n autograph,2008-03-12 21:55:00,2540,"if you wanna pay for culligan...lol....but i'm looking as well, there are plenty of quality companies in our area that sell/rent water softners."
170558,silveradosheriff,2008-03-12 22:02:00,1025,"I don't mind paying a bit more, as long as I'm getting value for the dollar. Let me know how you make out.....thanks!"
170566,Gerritt,2008-03-12 22:28:00,6129,"Rod,  A bit of advice. It is ok to add a water softener. But do not add a reverse osmosis system as well if your house has copper piping.  I know of alot of people that have done this (as an upsell on a softener package) Ohhh we are here already we will only charge you this $$..   Do not do it. the problem with reverse osmosis and copper piping is the water actually is cleaning your copper piping, you are drinking whatever is in the pipes from over the years.  Do some Google research if so inclined...  I will talk to a couple of our plumbing and mechanical contractors and see what they recommend as a middle to high end range unit. We install these into all our homes that are not on a major municipal water system.  I will let you know.  G"
170583,wallyboss,2008-03-12 23:05:00,1095,I mentioned Culligan because it was the only one that came to mind. I wanted to make sure that you got the water tested and not go out and just buy any one of them.   You can install all the softening stuff that you want if your water needs conditioning to be potable  a softener will be no help.
170584,wallyboss,2008-03-12 23:05:00,1095,ooppss
170650,Dano,2008-03-13 01:10:00,719," Well, you are kinda right Gerritt. The reverse osmosis water is very aggresive and will eat copper lines, no question about it. Plus they waste a lot of water in the process, something ridiculous like 3 gallons to produce one. At any rate, thats why most people have the ro water only run to one tap, usually at the kitchen sink plumbed in with plastic pipe- no problems. I think all this ro stuff is overkill for the average home but it has its applications.  Water hardness will generally be dictated by where the water is drawn from. Groundwater from wells will usually be harder and contain larger amounts of things like iron that gets picked up as it filtres through the ground strata, water drawn from lakes and rivers will be softer as a rule. Rain water is true soft water."
