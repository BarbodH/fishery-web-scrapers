170919,HUKDONFAWNIX,2008-03-13 16:12:00,135,"Hello everyone,  I'm going fishing for some Brook trout for the first time and I need some help regarding what line I should use?  I will be casting and trolling in a lake.  I would assume either 6-8 lb. mono or fluorocarbon?  Not sure what brand is best either since I only use Power Pro for my Pike and Bass set ups.  Thank you in advance for your expertise.  "
170923,BillM,2008-03-13 16:17:00,17367,I'd use something like 4lb mono if it were me.  Perhaps something like Spiderwire Invisibraid?
170925,NAC,2008-03-13 16:29:00,369,"for trolling, 6lb mono to a 3 way swivel w/ 4lb fluoro to the lure and the weight dangling on 2-4lb mono/fluoro keep the leads 4ft or less to the lure and weight  I use this method for lakers, specks and splake  Good luck!"
170968,solopaddler,2008-03-13 18:22:00,8605,Any premium 6lb mono is really all you'll need.
170987,Stoty,2008-03-13 19:34:00,2910, Agreed. I use Berkley XL 6lb test. (clear)  No need to spend money on flourocarbon.
170992,Cookslav,2008-03-13 19:54:00,1457,"6lb P-line for me!  Thats my line of choice, fishing for Specs, lakers, and Splake in Algonquin. Its a durable, low stretch low visibility line, and I seriously have not a single complaint. I've been warned about knot strength, but I've not had any issues to date.  I used to use Berkly Vanish, but found the P-line to be 10x more durable, with WAY less memory I cast it troll it...works great, and its not overly expensive.  Good luck"
171068,boatman,2008-03-13 22:17:00,350,"I use 4lbs Berkley XL or Sensitive on an ultra-lite. Biggest fish I've landed with this combo is a 21"" rainbow (3lbs or so) with no problems."
171125,fishing n autograph,2008-03-13 23:13:00,2540,4 lbs Berkley Vanish
171139,troutologist,2008-03-13 23:37:00,951,another vote for 6lb p line. nothing but good to say about it. Although I do use 6lb fluoro for leaders on my dropper rigs
171182,danc,2008-03-14 00:55:00,4677," I agree. Nothing fancy needed here. I tried 4lb. for a while and only discovered that I lost more $8.00 Rapalas on snags. Wasn't worth it. I think that everyone is so obsessed with braid these days, and haven't realized that mono quality has increased beyond belief lately. I use 6 lb. mono for Trout, Walleye, Pike, and whatever else I fish for. Try it. I'll bet you fall in love with all over again."
