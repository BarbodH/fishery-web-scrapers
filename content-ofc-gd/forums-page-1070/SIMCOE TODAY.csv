170833,largemouth,2008-03-13 13:30:00,112,YOUR REPORTS WOULD BE A BETTER READ IF YOU DIDN'T TYPE IN CAPS CONSTANTLY. DO YOU DO IT TO PIZZ OTHERS OFF OR ARE YOU A SLOW LEARNER?
170842,bbog,2008-03-13 13:47:00,665,"This was your most diplomatic way of asking CANADIAN_COPPER to not SHOUT?  Nice report CC and great pictures. It was my son that got me into fishing three years ago and now he doesn't go. Enjoy all the time you can.  Cheers, Barnie"

171154,jdmls,2008-03-14 00:04:00,575,"  Buddy....CAPS is his signature...when you see caps in a subject line, more time than none get ready to read a crazy pic filled post !!! Learn who to respect on this board as it won't get you any by disrespecting well liked members !!!  KEEP UP THE CAPS MY MAN... IT MAKES IT  EASIER FOR US STEELHEADERS TO SCOPE OUT YOUR POSTS !!!"
