170512,Bernie,2008-03-12 21:02:00,3190,Part of my daily commute in open water season is 6 miles of boat travel. It's going to hurt  . I'm glad my engine is fuel efficient. Will likely be half throttle in the travels now.
170525,ranger520vx,2008-03-12 21:19:00,164,"No more Steak and Prime Rib dinners for me on the road. I saw a sale on Vienna Sausages at No Frills for $o.49 a tin so I loaded up with a few cases.  I'm also going to watch some Trailer Park Boys reruns to see how Ricky siphons fuel  Really...gonna not run wide open as much, fish closer to launch, slow down towing on highway, sleep in the back of my Avalanche just to keep getting my fix.  At this point I'd throw my support behind any political party that would bring Nationalizing of Canadas' oil resources back into discussion, like in Venezuela.  SEE FOR YOURSELF"
170534,Rich Clemens,2008-03-12 21:43:00,3131,"I got me two trips up north scheduled .. June and September.   LOOK OUT ... I""M COMING !!!  (Oh yeah .. I bought her an oar for Christmas ... just in case we would run out of gas)."
170554,Canuck2fan,2008-03-12 22:00:00,1444," You have a very good point about packaging. When I got out of school in the early eighties I worked at a plastic factory. One of the mags out for the industry at that time was bragging that Union Carbide at the time was selling over a million lbs of garbage bags a month (world wide)..... in the next issue someone wrote in who said ""They shouldn't be bragging about that because it takes the same amount of crude oil to produce that plastic as it does to make the equivalent weight in gasoline..... I remember a few of the guys in the plant who knew the chemistry behind plastics agreeing with the statement..... Sort of blows your mind when you think about it, and how oil is a finite resource."
170783,OhioFisherman,2008-03-13 10:53:00,6623,"Gas prices here went from $ 2.95 a gallon to $ 3.45 a gallon in like a week? $ 3.45 x 27 = $ 93.15, the projected price of my next fill up.  Lucky my main vehicle is electric?"
170799,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-13 12:21:00,1183,"Yesterday in North Bay the gas prices were $115.9.  Two hours down the road, it was $109.9...almost felt like it was a ""deal""...And it's not just gas, it's food as well.  Not sure how many of you men grocery shop...anyhow, that too is on the rise.  It's just everything...makes it a little harder to get ahead, or at least to enjoy a little more.  Sometimes, there are ways around it, other times you have no other option but to vito a year and save for the next."
170815,lew,2008-03-13 12:56:00,12767,"Dan McTeague (sp) the MP who is always talking about gas prices, but never really does anything about them, claims that everbodies prediction of $1.50 / litre by summer is inacurate,  and he claims the prices will actually drop to about .95 Â¢  I've heard that on a couple different news reports in the last week or so, but who knows where he's getting his info from  A couple local stations here in Toronto were $1.09.4 yesterday but have dropped to $1.08.8 today, so maybe his prediction of the downward slide to cheaper Canadian gasoline has already started.......ya right"
170819,holdfast,2008-03-13 12:59:00,1813,"Just remember, you will be on a fixed income too.  See what you think about when prices are ridiculously out of control.  YOU MIGHT BE WORRIED MORE THAN YOUR FISHING TRIPS AND HOLIDAYS.  I wonder why the global warming conferance was canceled in Toronto and points East.  Suzuki if you think that I would be glad to pay more in the name of global warming?  EAT MY SHORTS YOU DEPRESSING MORON"
170828,lew,2008-03-13 13:19:00,12767," C'mon holdfast, let it all out, tell us how you REALLY feel"
170835,jwoolley,2008-03-13 13:34:00,25,"Add gas, take an extra friend, and fish on!! I won't be home this fishing season, I will be out on the water.  OlTroll"
170836,Headhunter,2008-03-13 13:34:00,5703,"Holdfast... Suzuki eating your shorts may cause flatulatory issues and as such, add to global warming! I'd suggest he just walks around wearing them on his head instead! HH"
170989,NipissingTaco,2008-03-13 19:40:00,4,"I have 3 sit on top kayaks and a canoe so..... I also bought a little Honda Jazz Scooter 49cc to zip around town now that the media and wall street have convinced us gas will go to those heights and heck, why not higher. Will definitely not be running around in the Tacoma on a whim. Have a planned early July trip with my son to Cedar Lake, NE Algonquin, and another planned 5 day trip with my wife to Bruce Peninsula National Park. We'll take the Emotion Fisherman pro and her Hobie Mirage sport to paddle (and peddle) around in."
170993,Kirk,2008-03-13 19:59:00,347,"Slow news day + media = upcoming disaster of the day  average tank is 50L, gas going from 1.00 per litre (which was the last 'catastrophe') to 1.50 per litre = $25.00 more in bigger cars less in smaller cars.  So its funny to watch the news with anchors with serious looks...warning about a 20 buck news story."
170299,kennyman,2008-03-12 12:59:00,737,"It will really only affect getting there for me. I have a 14ft tinny with an 8hp Yamaha and a canoe because I have to keep my costs down, I really have no choice. But that said,I still have my family vacations booked for Sandbanks and Charleston. so that'll cost a few bucks in the old wagon but oh well. I'm not stopping my life or changing my vacation for the extra $50. I have customers with street rods,muscle cars etc. and a few of them are whining about the gas. Funny thing is these guys are the same ones that didn't flinch on the $5000 extra bucks they spent on modifying their engines or 5,10 or even $30,000 on the body and paint (yes $30,000)of their ride. Most of the guys drive their street/race cars maybe once a week in the fair weather if they're lucky. So an extra $10 to fill up shouldn't kill them. If it does they can always take up checkers instead. Honestly it may change the way we use our toys. Maybe we'll stay a litte closer to home?For the guys with the 200hp motors on the back,maybe they'll drift more,troll less, but I doubt it. Usually hard core guys just do there thing. Let's face it,we only go around once on this rock (except Lew's coming back as a Musky) so we may as well get the most out of it."
170480,grt1,2008-03-12 19:42:00,638,"I just filled up the truck, it took 83 litres and cost $102.  it's $1.23 a litre here in Red Lake"

170061,Headhunter,2008-03-11 19:56:00,5703,"With the price of gas continuing to rise, with rumours of gas hitting $1.40 /ltr by the summer, what if any effect with this have on your fishin plans for the summer? We've had this question before, but given that it is a slow time of year and I never really was a Chuck Norris fan, I thought I'd pose this question! HH"
170062,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-11 19:58:00,2585,im sure it will effect alot of resorts that have americans coming up to stay with them.  As for me it wont.  i dont fish to often so when i do i dont care about how much it costs.  Cheers!
170063,ccmtcanada,2008-03-11 20:01:00,7971,"The effect is that I'll make sure I buy gas at local stations, rather than at marinas.  This is the first spring/summer with the boat, so I have nothing to compare it to...I just hope to be able to use it more than a few times this year!"
170065,2 tone z71,2008-03-11 20:06:00,1311,"makes no differance to me at all, I am gonna try and get out as much maybe more than last year,I run from Pointe au Baril-damm near Killarney any givin weekend fishing different spots every weekend,I love the bay and being on it gas prices are not slowin me down"
170066,mepps,2008-03-11 20:08:00,1301,"I wont effect me sicne i'm mainly a shore fisherman, but im sure the people with big boats will be fishing less!"
170067,cityfisher,2008-03-11 20:09:00,959,its not going to stop me... my fishing time is so restricted already with work so when I can get out Ill pay the extra cash to get there instead of sitting at home wishing I went
170068,SlowPoke,2008-03-11 20:09:00,2984,"I plan to catch more to keep my mind off the gas prices. To be honest, the boat gas doesn't bother me as much as the truck gas consumption. I'll probably be towing a little more often with my van this year which will save me about $20 per round trip to LSC or Lake Ontario. I may also consider more two day trips instead of running back home and out again the next day. -Brian"
170069,fishnsled,2008-03-11 20:10:00,3520,I'll be fishing with Cliff in his boat and leaving mine at home.  LOL!   Probably won't change things too much as far as fishing plans go.  I am looking around for a smaller car for commuting to work though.  I figure I'm spending about $800 a month in gas now as it is and it would be nice to get that down a bit.  Commuting in a full size truck isn't the easiest on the wallet.
170070,ccmtcanada,2008-03-11 20:12:00,7971, LOL...we're going to need someone who knows where to fish in a boat....and it may as well be you Will....
170078,16 Footer,2008-03-11 20:36:00,191,If gas price is a problem get back to basics: aluminum boat with 10 - 25 hp and trailer. Easy to tow with most cars and easy on gas. That is what I have and am going fishing.
170079,tdotfisherman,2008-03-11 20:37:00,317,I'll just have to take my buddies car up to the cottage more often.. lol..
170080,Tdel,2008-03-11 20:38:00,393,I am feeling the pinch and I have a small car.  I feel sorry for those driving tanks.  Gas prices today in Midland > Noco > $1.119 and SuperStore > $1.10.7 Prices in Penetang have to be higher because they usually are higher.  Tom
170084,2 tone z71,2008-03-11 20:42:00,1311,"your right that would work nice enough,I grew up with and had those type of boats since I was 8,after being in the bigger boats theres no looking back,after coming out of the gun barrels last July from the Bustard Iliands and there where 10 ft waves or better il stick to my bigger boat,where im running out of Georgain Bay alot of times theres no shelter"
170090,lew,2008-03-11 20:48:00,12767,"Nope, it won't be affecting any of my plans, I'll still be heading to Lakair on Nippising a couple times this year, plus my usual trip to the Ottawa River, and then as always, I'll be spending most of my time travelling all over the Kawarthas from early May till November.  I don't drink or smoke, and my wife won't allow me to chase loose women, so I may as well spend my money on gas for fish'n."
170094,irishfield,2008-03-11 21:11:00,26272,HAHAHA Lew ! You sure Diane isn't related to Leah somehow?  Price of gas... Joe you know my answer to that. It's cheaper now than it was in 2005's summer at $1.37 Temagami Shell and $1.52 Marina. Not gonna slow my fishing down one bit.... but I might put a tip jar in the boat ! That should go a long way....
170095,Deano,2008-03-11 21:12:00,767,"25hp Honda four stroke, so it won't effect my boating/fishing time at all, just may not travel so far to fish, fish closer to home. Did a 40km trip last year with my boat and only used a quarter tank."
170097,fishdawg,2008-03-11 21:16:00,912,"nope not very much  last couple of seasons my fishing style has shifted more to the Great Lakes  - ive got nearly 8 various launches for Lake O, Lake Erie & the Niagara all within 15-45 minutes of my place  the 4 stroke 30HP Johnson helps too"
170098,TJQ,2008-03-11 21:18:00,7806,Nope...  if anything it will make me add days to my trips to camp so the gas expense is worth it!
170099,irishfield,2008-03-11 21:19:00,26272, Now that's positive thinking! I think I'll cut my trips to the lake to ONE this summer! LOL
170100,charlied,2008-03-11 21:19:00,584,well I live 2 blocks from lake erie...but like to travel to fishing spots...so I guess I will be staying close to home for most of the summer.  Wanted to try my kayak out up north near bancroft but it would cost around $200 in gas and thats out of the question for sure.
170104,Roy,2008-03-11 21:45:00,13728,"I've been driving since the early 60's and every year, gas prices are at an all time high. That's how it works. Some people don't care that much about gas prices but the ones who do care MIGHT decide to make shorter trips. All this will do is redistribute the client base for rental cottages, camp sites and lodges. People in North Bay  might hit Timmins instead of Thunder Bay..people in Ottawa will hit Quinte instead of Manitoulin etc...  I don't like to see the price of gas going up either but ever since I've been driving, it's never gone down.  Addendum: I've been working hard most of my life, as most of you have. I'd hate like hell to think that some oil company or anybody else is going to dictate whether I go fishing or not this year."
170106,Whopper,2008-03-11 21:54:00,2174,"I like to say it not going to effect me but then again when the funds run out what ya going to do. I generally make two trips to Canada and at least ten trips to Lake Erie, so we'll see."
170113,Riparian,2008-03-11 22:18:00,269,"Its funny, the first thing people are going to do when gas prices hit record levels is to re-evaluate every trip in the car, every litre burned.  you might find you can better manage gas consumption by cutting down on the amount of times you drive your car. Im looking forward to these high gas prices... it might mean a little bit cleaner air for all of us."
170115,Raf,2008-03-11 22:19:00,3495,"gotta pay to play.  having said that, might make a few wiser choices (ie.  make those 4hr treks up north for longer periods of time at a time)."
170117,Canuck2fan,2008-03-11 22:29:00,1444,"As Irishfield told us GAS IS CHEAPER than the summer of 05 so I don't know what everyone is whining about.... Everybody is much better off financially now than then, because we have the mighty Tories those fiscally prudent managers looking after us with all their tax cuts, and even minimum wage as increased to 8.75.....  On a serious note I will be sure that I invite some buddies when I go this year to help share the costs. Who am I kidding no I won't bother doing that because when I want to go I will just GO. Besides everybody knows if it ain't thunder and lighting I am at one lake or another fishing on Sundays..... all they have to do is call Saturday night and they are invited till the car is full."
