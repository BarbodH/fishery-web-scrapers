169859,livinisfishin,2008-03-11 01:57:00,661,"Hey everybody, are pickerel levels still low in six mile lake. I was camping there last summer and in their newsletter they had an article asking anglers to practise catch and release because there was a smaller population of the fish."
169870,steverowbotham,2008-03-11 02:18:00,1800,fished there many many times (targetted bass every time) but i have never caught a walleye on six mile
169895,Greencoachdog,2008-03-11 03:48:00,8163,"Chain, Redfin, or Grass?"
169906,discophish,2008-03-11 05:11:00,392,"I have caught grass, been caught with it, tree limbs, dock chains, shanked a couple of fins ... but no pickerel.  I don't think I have marked any significant schools in there.  But that's just me.  I couldn't even catch a cold to take a day off work."
170156,Domi Fish,2008-03-11 23:58:00,46,I fished Six Mile on more than one occaison last summer. No Walleye to speak of.

170174,Gerritt,2008-03-12 01:06:00,6129,"I will call them Pickeral to the day I die...  My dad does, my grandfather does as did his dad and his grandfather...  Who am I to break tradition.  Calling Walleye Pickeral is Canadian!.... please dont bow to US interests...   Hell call em yellow n' black carp for all I care...  in my house we eat Pickeral.  G"
170176,Muskieman,2008-03-12 01:18:00,2472,....Pickerel are very bony ....watch you don't choke on the bones ... I hear that have to be cleaned like Pike.   :whistling:
170191,livinisfishin,2008-03-12 02:08:00,661,I guess that answers my question abuot them being low. I was camping at the provincial park and i swear it had an article on it. The way you guys are talking it makes me think that i imagined them being in there.
170192,livinisfishin,2008-03-12 02:11:00,661,"Alright so i just checked out some sources, one is the ontario parks website, it says Pickerel is a species in there, as well as the backwater tackle fishing report, said since pickerel season is over in gb that we should try six mile lake."
170649,bow slayer,2008-03-13 01:09:00,1074,I use to camp in the park and fish the lake. We always caught walleyes usually 3 or 4 a day. They are definately there but not in great numbers. I caught most of mine at the waterfalls in  both of the pools. Also had descent luck on a few shoals around islands.
