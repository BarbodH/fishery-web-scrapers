170804,Tarzan's Jane,2008-03-13 12:29:00,1183,Spring is in the air for sure....all these newbies     Welcome Mike
170806,Anton Kanagasuntheri,2008-03-13 12:33:00,160,"Welcome, welcome, you are gonna love this board if you love fishing.."
170814,muskymike,2008-03-13 12:49:00,772,"Hey guys, thanks for being so welcoming.  I look forward to all the banter that I see that goes on in here and will do my best to keep up."
170856,muskymike,2008-03-13 14:07:00,772,"Since I am new to this board I need to ask, where is all the ""help"" sections located? I feel really slow but this is a more complex board then i have ever been on haha  Good on ya guys."
170868,BillM,2008-03-13 14:19:00,17367,"Mike, you ever need someone to throw muskie baits for 12-14hrs let me know.  I just got into Muskie fishing myself and GB from Severn all the way up to the North channel will hopefully be my new stomping grounds"
170877,muskymike,2008-03-13 14:27:00,772,"Sounds good Bill. Although the Kawarthas are a lot easier to fish with results, the challenge of Georgian Bay is too much to pass up.  I am going to really try and focus on the Moon River Delta, Severn Sound and Pointe Au Baril in particular. I am itchin to get out now.  I am also going to try Toronto Harbour this year. I have never fished it, i dont know why. But I want to try this year. Soon hopefully."
170881,BillM,2008-03-13 14:32:00,17367,"Yeah, I plan on doing some urban pike fishing hopefully before the 31st of March.  Weather shouldn't be bad the nest few days.. I saw open water down at Ontario place yesterday while at the SportsMan show.  I've been told the Kawartha's is a easier place to fish also   I'm up for anything, as long as I'm out on the water, lol."
170882,shane,2008-03-13 14:35:00,652, There should be a help button at the top of this page...in that dark brown bar...right under the OFC sign...7th one from the left
171021,Big Cliff,2008-03-13 21:15:00,6899,"Well, I'm really sorry for your luck but we already have our limit of musky fishermen here, you'll have to stand in line and wait for an opening...... Oh what the heck, guess there is always room for one more. Welcome!"
170613,muskymike,2008-03-13 00:10:00,772,"Hey everyone,  I was looking at the overwhelming response to Anton and have been meaning to do this but I am usually only on here when I get a quick minute. So I am officially introducing myself.  My name is Mike and I am from Stoney Creek. I work in the residential construction sector (office) for probably the largest Homebuilder in Canada.  I mainly fish Georgian Bay from Port Severn to Bayfield, and hit the Kawartha's every once in a while. In the past few years I have really got into Musky and keep spending far too much on it every year. I fish smallies and walleye and do a lot of pike fishing just for fun. I release everything except the occasional walleye.  I will have pics up soon when I can get this network working at home.  I am on a few other boards but this one seems to be so active and everyone on here seems to be really really helpful and friendly so I am sticking to OFC as my primary for sure.  Its great to see everyone on here so active and I am happy to be a member now.  I will help out with any advice, knowledge I have which is mainly GBay.  Thanks and I will talk to you all soon.  Mike"
170617,ranger520vx,2008-03-13 00:25:00,164,well its been 14 minutes so im happy to say welcome first!
170618,danbouck,2008-03-13 00:27:00,4380,Welcome! If I may ask which Home Builder do you work for?
170621,Rizzo,2008-03-13 00:30:00,4754,"Go away, nobody here likes musky fisherman  :D    Kidding of course, hope to see some reports of  big GBAY skis this summer/fall."
170622,muskymike,2008-03-13 00:30:00,772,"Thanks Ranger, I am glad to be apart of this board now. Now I have to get myself a hat so I can be ""known"" as an OFC'r.  This is probably the classiest looking board I have seen around too. Just the look of the site in General is really well done."
170623,muskymike,2008-03-13 00:32:00,772,"Sure Dan, Mattamy would be that company. I hope I didn't gain some enemies by putting this in the General view haha"
170624,Muskieman,2008-03-13 00:33:00,2472,:thumbsup_anim:  EH!   Welcome aboard the board !!  :canadian:  p.s    don't call Walleye ..   pickerel   Have fun while your here
170627,Rich Clemens,2008-03-13 00:38:00,3131,A little late ??   A musky is never late mike ... we'll take one any time.    Welcome aboard.
170628,fatherof3,2008-03-13 00:41:00,1769,welcome to the board
170631,Gerritt,2008-03-13 00:54:00,6129,w00t! welcome aboard!!  Better late then never..... now... about that Muskie porn.....   G
170632,muskymike,2008-03-13 00:57:00,772,"haha I am gettin' there G, it is saying my files are too large though.  I am not the most experienced on boards, but when I figure it out I will get them on here. I am no pro by any means and like I said, just started the Musky obsession.  I will get em' up though. Sooner or later"
170635,Gerritt,2008-03-13 00:59:00,6129,mike try photobucket.com for pictures and youtube.com for videos   (photobucket can do vids too but they suck @ vids)  then you dont have the size restrictions.  Hope this helps.  G
170637,shane,2008-03-13 01:02:00,652,"Welcome aboard MM.  I figured out the pic posting thing, so I'm sure anybody can   I upload them from my Flickr site."
170638,muskymike,2008-03-13 01:02:00,772,"G, if I put them on Photobucket, do I reference them on here? Or should I just add them to the gallery on here?"
170641,danbouck,2008-03-13 01:03:00,4380,  Let's do some Musky Fish'n and talk about some elevators for Mattamy
170647,muskymike,2008-03-13 01:07:00,772,Dan do you guys do just elevators or do you do lifts too? I had a lady inquire yesterday about a lift along her stair...
170654,Gerritt,2008-03-13 01:15:00,6129,Mike you make an account on photobucket (it is free) upload the pictures to there.... then send us the links to them  all the code is there for you to do so... if you would like to know more I would be happy to help you out in the computer section  but tomorrow lol  G.
170657,danbouck,2008-03-13 01:19:00,4380,We manufacture Elevators and Lifts for Outside (Decklifts) but we do deal with Stair lifts as well. Shoot me a PM!
170668,muskymike,2008-03-13 01:35:00,772,"Sounds good G, I am pretty good with computers but no pro. I am familiar with photobucket but not with message boards at all. I am still trying to figure out the signature part and so on, I will eventually figure it out, I hope.  Strange, I used to work with a guy named Gerritt and he was a phenom with computers. He was a grimsby boy though, not from the Hammer."
170675,ccmtcanada,2008-03-13 01:41:00,7971,Hey there!  Welcome to the board...glad you finally decided to post that intro.  Looking forward to those musky pics...the big ones from the past and the ones from this upcoming season.  Pull up a chair...beware though...you may be on here more than you planned....
170691,irishfield,2008-03-13 01:53:00,26272, say what... what day is it again?
170693,muskymike,2008-03-13 01:54:00,772,Thanks cc. I feel kind of bad for not posting it earlier. I am already addicted though. I know this will become a problem.
170715,Bernie,2008-03-13 02:29:00,3190,Welcome to the board Muskiemike. Nipissing has a few dandy muskie in it too.  
170760,Mike the Pike,2008-03-13 04:19:00,3421,Welcome aboard and remember we love fish pics
170796,cthewrld,2008-03-13 12:12:00,99,"Welcome aboard.  Keep us ""posted"" of your fishing adventures."
