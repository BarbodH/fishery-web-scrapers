170733,Fishmaster,2008-03-13 03:03:00,920,March Break Crappies  Was a beauty day to sit outside and fish …Zack Chris and I thought after playing with minnows all morning we would try our luck for some Crappies’s in the marina. Fish were on for me but Zack and Chris just couldn’t get a hook set. I landed some nice slabs! It looks like spring Slab fishing is going to be very good.  Ice was 12 to 15” thick…Now is the time to get the Kids out and enjoy fishing on March Break …Fishmaster     Here is a shot from a couple of days ago when I was out crappie fishing in the evening.  Another hand caught Bowfin…guess these darn  things like getting their picture taken

170751,waterwolf,2008-03-13 03:42:00,556,"yes ,  it was a great day to be out and about doing anything. nice crappies but where'd you find the dinosaur?  looks a cross between a pike and a channel cat .  i have never caught one but hear  they're fearless,, very aggressive .  good to get the kids  out of the house for some fresh air . my daughter lost the bug a couple of years ago and i'm hoping the  affliction returns so we can spend some more time together on the water . great way to spend the day for sure.  hats off. tight lines."

171084,Smokey,2008-03-13 22:33:00,1278,Nice fish Steve. Hows the ice in the marina area? Should be good for a bit to keep the hardwater season going for you right in your backyard.
