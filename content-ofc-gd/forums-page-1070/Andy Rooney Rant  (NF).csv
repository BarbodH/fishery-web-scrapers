170494,solopaddler,2008-03-12 20:12:00,8605," I know Doug, I'm just joking. (Or am I?  )  Seriously I'm going mental, I've been putting in 100 hour weeks recently. Between my regular job, renovating my current house, and endlessly searching for a new one it's been tough. The end is in sight though, but still a long way to go.  I need to get out  ."

170163,fishindevil,2008-03-12 00:27:00,6254,"Well that pretty much hit the nail on the head didnt it !!!!!!!....rooney does usually say whatever he wants,so who knows who said those statements"
170181,Mike Pike,2008-03-12 01:36:00,1332,"When somebody poses as someone else( Andy Rooney )and then makes a pile of statements about race and religion, I question the movitves of that individual.  Regardless or whether you feel those points are true or not, the person making 'em is pretty sketchy and I don't like to give them too much credit for their views.  But that's me."
170214,snag,2008-03-12 03:02:00,1932,Every race has it's racists. Every religion it's fundamentalists.  be smart
170216,Cookslav,2008-03-12 03:30:00,1457,"Its all in the angle you look from I s'pose. If you keep it generic theres nothing but truth in them lines... But if you make an issue and apply it to a specific race, or ""every"" imigrant then yes...its racist  To me its a pretty generic statement....its all good.  And I'm no raceist...I hate everyone equally"

170448,douG,2008-03-12 18:59:00,2693,"...Moreover, Rooney himself denied it in 2003, saying:  ""About a year ago, I became aware of a more serious theft of my name and it is so hurtful to my reputation that it calls for legal action against the thief. Hundreds of people have written asking if I really wrote the 20 detestable remarks made under my name that have had such wide circulation on the Internet.  [...]  Some of the remarks, which I will not repeat here, are viciously racist and the spirit of the whole thing is nasty, mean and totally inconsistent with my philosophy of life. It is apparent that the list of comments has been read by hundreds of thousands of Americans, many of whom must believe that it accurately represents opinions of mine that I don't dare express in my column or on television. It is seriously damaging to my reputation.""  It is attitudes such as those incorrectly attributed to Andy Rooney that are in part responsible for the growing mess of hatred, lack of tolerance and growth of misunderstanding that is at the root of our collective downfall.  Just look around you or read a newspaper that doesn't feed your growing fear and encourage your isolation.  Do you follow any sort of faith or religion?  I 'spect you do.  Talking about stones, do you have them big enough to ask the hard questions?  Is that attitude consistent with the teachings of Jesus, or Mohammad, or Buddha, or the Dali Lama?"
