171328,rickster,2008-03-14 12:56:00,495,glad to hear you are OK cliff hope everything works out
171342,Hooked,2008-03-14 13:57:00,891,"Important thing is that you're ok.  Definately glad to hear you had witnesses, unlike my nephews accident he had last year, which he's stilll struggling with."
171426,Big Cliff,2008-03-14 18:04:00,6899,"Thanks for all the replies and advice, very much appreciated!  Lew, glad you got through it OK."
171316,cranks bait,2008-03-14 12:31:00,721,"Morning Cliff,  Sorry I don't have a computer at home to be able to answer your question.  So I have to do it from work.  Sure hope the boss doesn't find out.  Because your insurance company is the one paying for the claim, you get what your coverage has.  Yes they get reimbursed (so I believe, don't really care) by the other persons company.  If you did not have the loss of use, it would be a big hassle.  I understood it as you would have to get lawyers involved and try and get reimbursed yourself from the other company.  In my opinion, the $30.00 a year for that coverage was well worth it considering I had to use a rental for over a month.  Basically once the ball gets rolling, you do not have to do anything.  Be prepared to be without your vehicle for a while.  Don't rush them, that way you don't get a rushed job, as in paint not fully cured etc.  When your vehicle is done make sure you check it over really well.  Paint matching, parts on properly etc.  Sounds like your at a reputable place so you should have no problems.  Now you just have to get used to driving another vehicle.  Just as you get comfortable with it, you'll get yours back and have to get used to that one all over again.  Another thing I always do is write down exactly what happened, weather conditions, date, time of day, etc.  That way if it comes back to haunt you 3 years down the road, you know what happened.  I was in a very serious accident when I lived out west.  It took eight years to be settled.   It's amazing the things that you forget, but by having it writen down, that is your proof."
170537,Big Cliff,2008-03-12 21:45:00,6899,"My day started off OK but it sure went down hill fast. I was on my way into town for an appointment and a Chev Astrovan ran a red light and nailed me on the right rear wheel. He claimed he tried to stop and slid, the roads were slush covered but he really hit me hard, my truck has a lot of damage.I spun in a full 180 and it was all I could do to keep from hitting the oncomming traffic.  Fortunatly for me there were lots of witnesses and he has been charged with running a red light. My insurance company has already aranged for me to have a replacement vehicle to drive and will tell me in the next few days if mine will be fixed or written off (fortunatly I have full replacement). I really want to thank PC T. Stewart from the City of Kawartha Lakes Police Dept.. He was so kind and considerate with me, made sure I was OK, aranged for a tow truck for me, made sure I had all the necessary information to give to my insurance company. The gentileman that stayed with me until the Police arrived and gave a statement; Moyers Towing, their driver went out of his way to give me a ride over to the Nissan Dealership so that I could get another car to drive; and all the very kind people that stopped to make sure I was OK and see if I needed anything. Gosh I love living in a small town!  The best part of it is that I am OK, a little stiff and sore but nothing serious, us old guys are use to being stiff and sore anyway LOL. The car will be fixed or replaced, me, well I'll just get better!"
170541,cthewrld,2008-03-12 21:49:00,99,Glad you are OK.  Cars are easy to replace.  People ..... not so much.
170542,ccmtcanada,2008-03-12 21:50:00,7971,Wow...could have been a lot worse Cliff!  Glad to see so many people making sure you were ok and stayed with you through the process.  So are you hoping for a new vehicle??????
170545,Bernie,2008-03-12 21:53:00,3190,Glad you are OK Cliff. I hope they can fix up your Astro. It may be hard to find another good one. Too bad they quit making them. They were a pretty good multi-purpose vehicle.  Ooops. Reread your post.  It wasn't YOUR Astro van. What were you driving?
170547,tinbanger,2008-03-12 21:53:00,1028,Glad to hear you are ok . Vehicles are repairable or replaceable .  Stock up on the Advil as the soreness may get worse .TAKE CARE   TB
170548,Terry,2008-03-12 21:54:00,14456,one of those days...  as long as you are ok everything else can be replaced
170550,silveradosheriff,2008-03-12 21:56:00,1025,Glad to hear you are OK!
170551,Whopper,2008-03-12 21:58:00,2174,"Sorry to hear about the mishap, but glad your ok!"
170552,fishing n autograph,2008-03-12 21:58:00,2540,"See we're not all bad  But seriously, monitor yourself, whiplash and other soft tissue injuries as a result of traffic collisions (not accidents...that implies there is no fault) set in 24-48 hours after the fact....  Glad you're okay though, it's pretty dangerous when people run red lights....."
170563,fatherof3,2008-03-12 22:22:00,1769,good to hear you are ok
170567,irishfield,2008-03-12 22:29:00,26272,Pick a different colour this time Cliff... this one wasn't right for you it appears!  Good to hear all is well... and if not make that trip to emerg. The TempDis forms are a PITA from the insurance co... but a route you may need to take when you wake up and your head is pegged like Linda Blair....
170571,lew,2008-03-12 22:38:00,12767,"Scary stuff Cliff, good to hear your OK though.  Did the other fella slide thru the red light because of icy roads due to the plow drivers & salters being on strike up your way ??"
170574,Joey,2008-03-12 22:44:00,9122,"Well I'm so glad to hear you are okay.  Tomorrow may be a different story tho.  Usually the day after is the worst, kind of like working out  Make sure you make a claim for any lost wages etc.  That is what insurance is for bud.  Joey"
170576,medmart,2008-03-12 22:47:00,587,Glad to hear your ok Cliff  rob
170581,wallyboss,2008-03-12 22:58:00,1095,"He didn't slide thru the intersection because of the slush, he slid thru because of going to fast for the conditions!!  Glad you're okay.  Keep an eye on the banged up muscles they might tighten up in a day or so!!"
170585,TJQ,2008-03-12 23:07:00,7806,So long as your fine cliff thats all that matters... the rest is just a pain in the ass.
170586,Sinker,2008-03-12 23:07:00,8692,"Glad to hear your AOK Cliff!! I'm sure there have been lots of accidents like yours in Lindsay this winter.......the roads are a total mess!!!! I know the intersection by the college is a real doosie as well......I've seen more than a few there since the start of the new year!  Some people just can't take thier time.........they end up paying for it though.  Good luck with the insurance claim, hope it goes smooth for you.  Sinker"
170588,pikehunter,2008-03-12 23:10:00,1659,"Glad to hear all is OK Cliff. You have to watch out for stiffness for the next day or so as said soft tissue damage can take it's time. My wife experienced that in a car crash situation, the following day and thereafter, whiplash and it's nothing to joke about!"
170590,crappieperchhunter,2008-03-12 23:14:00,2582,What's that they say....if it doesn't kill you....it at least lets you go new vehichle shopping. Something like that anyway. Sorry for your poopy day Cliff...but I'm glad you are OK.  Count your blessings and take care of yourself....and watch out for those Kawartha Lakes Drivers!!! I cringe every summer when we are in Caygeon alot.
170594,tbayboy,2008-03-12 23:23:00,1497,Nice ending to a scary story Cliff.  Glad to hear nothing worse happened and nice to see people still care about each other.
170597,Gerritt,2008-03-12 23:31:00,6129,Cliff count your lucky stars my friend.... Glad you came out of this unscathed.  G
170599,Big Cliff,2008-03-12 23:33:00,6899,"Cliff, I really liked what I had and it is only two years old. If it can be fixed properly I'd be happy with that.  Bernie: It's a 2006 Nissan X-Trail  Thanks Dave! There are no bad ones in City of Kawartha Lakes any way LOL.  Wayne, Guess silver isn't a good colour, might go with bright red next time!  Lew, that is what he claims and the roads were covered in slush but he sure must have been sliding fast, he ended up stoping at least 5 van lengths from where he hit me so he was no where close to stopping.  As for being sore and stiff, well I guess I'll just have to see what tomorrow brings. I'd pour a shot of brandy or something but don't have any in the house so I think I'll just climb into a hot bath with a nice cup of tea and see if Sue feels sorry enough for me to give me a back rub LOL."
170615,Loonietoon,2008-03-13 00:16:00,1450,"Glad to hear you are OK Cliff... Vehicles can be replaced or fixed... People, different story.  Take care my friend.."
170625,ketchenany,2008-03-13 00:34:00,3229,"BC, when you walk away from it, all is well, the truck it can be replaced. We need you around here for advice; so as Clampit would ""sit a spell"" ."
170639,fishindevil,2008-03-13 01:02:00,6254,"Glad you are ok,cliff !!! hope you feel better in a few days,and i hope all goes well with getting your truck fixed...well like they say accidents happen"
