171071,Smokey,2008-03-13 22:20:00,1278,Great pics. Always nice to bring back the old memories. I got a scanner a few years back and over the winter I scanned all the old pics to computer. Now I get to see them more often and even better I have a digital copy of them on a disc stored at a friends place in case something ever happens here at the house. Nice way to ensure you'll always have a copy for the future.
