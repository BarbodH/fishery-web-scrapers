171421,Terry,2008-03-14 17:54:00,14456,been around for years and years I think it was about 12 years ago I saw it on in-fisherman show.....you would have to be nuts to do that you wouldn't know  if it was a catfish or a snapping turtle you were grabbing till it was too late..and a 40lb cat could win the fight and you would be it's trophy
171430,fishindevil,2008-03-14 18:35:00,6254,"Yes its different all right i think its called noodling !!!!!.  ..and like terry said you wouldnt want to poke a huge snapper and have him take a few of your fingers off...cause they would thats for sure,i seen a video of a guy wrestling with one cat and it was over 100lbs...can you imagine,and the cat almost drown the guy and he didnt give up...crazy"
171431,maybe,2008-03-14 18:37:00,307,"""Noodling"" is the term I've heard applied to it.  Here's the wikipedia entry.  They had that poor Mike Rowe guy doing it on the pilot of Dirty Jobs.  Fun to watch, but I wouldn't want my family trying it."
