Four hours of great action, fished in 70' with a small williams half half . Lots of fish landed and all promptly released (a few posed for a photo). Laker bite was on good with some bigger fish more than willing to hit.  Whitie's seemed to need a little more coaxing. Travel was not a problem for my sled I even passed a few trucks. Snow averaged around 13""-15"" with many 2-3' drifts.  Good luck to all heading out in the next few days, I know I'll try to squeeze a few more trips in.  RF       "
