171205,Cast Adventures,2008-03-14 01:44:00,74,"Sunburns and Good fishing past two days on the Niagara River!   Started later both days and let the sun warm the air before launching the boat. Very good numbers both days.    We found areas would be void of fish or schooled up tight!. Classic running and gunning until we located active fish was the key. Loose rainbow eggs tied in pink,yellow and peach yarn files also produced for us on these trips.   Some of the fish have been really strong! even had two jump in 32.5 degree water! Lots of Silvers around, one still had this nasty little guy still stuck to him when we put the fish in the net, talk about a fresh steelhead........      A few tanks landed in the mix      Experiment with different depths, it can make all the difference in the world!   See you on the River,  Paul Castellano Cast Adventures"

If anyone ever needs current condtions, please feel free to drop me a line. I live right on the lower river and check it every day.  Happy to help,  Paul Castellano Cast Adventures"

171455,Cast Adventures,2008-03-14 19:47:00,74,"Glad to hear anglers on this site our enjoying the Niagara Region fishing reports. Some good news! Tons of Robins have arrived here in Niagara Falls this past week, SPRING IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER  Before you know the ice will be gone and you'll be fishing your local waters! Can't wait to see more fishing reports on this site in the upcoming months! For those of you living near/close to Lake Erie. NY State waters are now open year round for bass!!! Please remember that there are always smallmouth to be caught that are not spawning (pre-spawn, post spawn) if you stay away from the shallow warmer waters/areas of the lake. Check you regs for more details!  See you on the River,  Paul Castellano Cast Adventures"
