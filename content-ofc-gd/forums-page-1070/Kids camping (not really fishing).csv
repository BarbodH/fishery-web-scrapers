170000,radar,2008-03-11 17:29:00,138,My buddy and I want to take our kids (ages 2 and 3.5) camping last weekend in June somewhere within a few hours of GTA. I've been to many of the Prov. Parks but I can't think of one that is particularily good for kids.  Tent camping and toilets with swimming in a lake and some pan fishing is all we are looking for.  Any suggestions? Recommendations? Ones to avoid?  Thanks
170003,yellowboat,2008-03-11 18:03:00,211,"Boat or shore fishing,  Balsam Lake has nice facilities ande both shore and Boat fishing opportunities."
170004,radar,2008-03-11 18:10:00,138,"Boat or Shore don't matter. I have a 16' Springbok with a 40hp but I don't know if I'll bring it. Thisone's for the kids, I may just stick to shore fishing.  I was all set to book Balsam today but there isn't a site available the weekend I want."
170005,Kirk,2008-03-11 18:11:00,347,"Balsam ditto Bass Lake near Orrilia  Lake Simcoe: Mara, Mcrae Point, Sibbald Point  basically any Provincial park thats classified 'recreational' is a safe bet  RESERVATIONS call asap as June can be prime and campgrounds can get filled up on those parks listed above near GTA, when booking tell them you have kids and they will place you accordingly.  Call asap, like today, for peace of mind."
170007,muskymike,2008-03-11 18:22:00,772,I dont think Bass Lake would be the best for kids.  I would say Sturgeon Bay just north of Parry Sound is really good though. I spend every summer as a child there and loved every minute of it. I still go every year.
170041,jediangler,2008-03-11 19:13:00,1923,"I'd suggest Valens Conservation area. Great camping, hiking trails, nice beach, playgrounds and good panfishing. They rent small aluminum boats as well as canoes and sit on top kayaks."
170055,lunkerbasshunter,2008-03-11 19:38:00,2585,i owuld try valens if you want to be close to home.  there is good pan fish there and if the camping fishing thing is to much for the little ones your close to african lions safari to keep them enertained lol  If you really want to go out of town.  Restoule pp has decent facilites and there is great fishing on tons of lakes in and around the area.  Im actually fishing this area this summer after a great time last year.  CHeers!
170076,Pinch,2008-03-11 20:31:00,231,"I took my 5 year old to Serpent Mounds Park in Keene, which is probably only an hour and a bit from Toronto and we had a great time.  The park was empty, my son and I were the only ones there and it was the middle of summer.  http://www.serpentmoundspark.com/"
170112,radar,2008-03-11 22:09:00,138,"Thanks guys. Valen's was looking pretty good. I was even thinking Santa's Village. Any thoughts on Emily PP? I'll check out the rest too. I was trying to keep it closer to home, but I'm not agains 3 hours or so out.  Lunkerbasshunter you hit it bang on about having a fall back option. My little guy is....how do you say..... rambunctious and needs lots of stimulous."
170122,Mike the Pike,2008-03-11 22:42:00,3421,I say try Sandbanks provincial park an easy straight drive down the 401 .  Lots of easy fishing along the outlet river which leads to East Lake or Lake O also good fishing.Pan fish galore and I mean instant sunfish.  Be sure to start the kiddies off with the easy to use push button rod and reel combos.  Bobbers always make it more fun .Have a good trip.MTP
170124,Muskieman,2008-03-11 22:53:00,2472,"If you haven't found 'em yet buy the kids the "" ROCKET FISHING ROD""  { respool the line with good stuff} goes more than 30 feet... keeps 'em busy nomatter where they fish  easy to use ..  As for a good provincial park.... Arrowhead provincial park on hwy 11n probably 2 or so hours from the GTA.....  good luck.."
170162,radar,2008-03-12 00:21:00,138,My little guy is hooked up with his Scooby doo rod. He did pretty good last year nailing some perch and sunfish. (another buddies 4 year old was killing the crappie on Rice with one last year - priceless!) Sometimes he just wants me to drop a couple of pan fish in the live well and he'll play around in there for a while.  I'm not pushing anything on him with fishing yet - just as long as he's having fun. And yeah I've been eyeballing that rocket rod - not sure I want him to have  that with a hook yet!
170164,fishing n autograph,2008-03-12 00:29:00,2540,how about Rondeau or Long Point where they can fish off the pier?
171039,goteeboy,2008-03-13 21:34:00,175,"For the best beach i've been to in a provinical, and okay for fishing is the Pinery, you can rent canoes. about 3.5 hrs away East. very good comfort stations."

171150,OhioFisherman,2008-03-13 23:51:00,6623,"If you are not against coming stateside you can try here  http://www.paradisebaypark.com/index.html  I have had all my kids there at various ages, tons of panfish, not much size to them though, although I never seriously fished for them.  Safe beach, a small lake that doesn`t get rough. Some serious bass fishing there."
