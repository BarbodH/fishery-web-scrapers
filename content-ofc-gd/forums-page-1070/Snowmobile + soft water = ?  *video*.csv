170735,irishfield,2008-03-13 03:08:00,26272,I like this one... call me cruel...  
170739,BillM,2008-03-13 03:12:00,17367,I think the best part is his buddies laughing at him..  How did he NOT see that tree?  lol
170756,DanTheMan,2008-03-13 04:10:00,257,"  OMG, Never seen that 1   LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
170831,ecmilley,2008-03-13 13:22:00,2163,"the april fools crowd had a 450 hp turbo apex built for this spring can't wait to see that one go, but here's another cool water cross video. "
170203,BillM,2008-03-12 02:23:00,17367,"Even though this isn't the brighest thing to do, it's still badass in my books...   "
170208,2 tone z71,2008-03-12 02:36:00,1311,"Them Polaris sleds they all came with Jesus boots,took my Dad across an open section a few winters back riding the bay home from Kilarney, thought he was gonna kill me when we got back to land but he still brings it up now and then,great vid thanks for sharing"
170210,BillM,2008-03-12 02:42:00,17367,That was also filmed from Midland to Pine Island (Georgian Bay)
170243,Tybo,2008-03-12 10:07:00,1373,"So, thats why they call it a paddle track."
170255,Big Cliff,2008-03-12 11:25:00,6899,Just don't hit the brakes LOL.
170290,Fishmaster,2008-03-12 12:47:00,920,And don't pull the teatherl cord ..was up in Haliburton and my buddie was crossing water and desided to wave to all of us as he was going buy forgetting his teather cord was on his waving hand ..lets just say the sled sunk in 40 fow ..lol..
170323,pigeonfisher,2008-03-12 14:22:00,696,How fast would they have to be going?   That is CRAZY
170353,2 tone z71,2008-03-12 15:05:00,1311,"it depends on the stretch of water sometimes ,when its only 100-150 ft we can roll right up to it get the skis wet and then come on to it ,Polaris of course is by far the best swimmers always have been,if your going 50 mph and hit or head for water you are NOT going down,its the panic people get when they see it and try to stop they would be better off crossing it and making way to better ice or shore,the snowmobile will actualy pick up speed on water"
170358,Cookslav,2008-03-12 15:11:00,1457,That....is insane! People do that for fun  I didn't even know that was possible....
170359,Headhunter,2008-03-12 15:11:00,5703,"I don't possess the ""sphere's"" to even consider that! Gotta be nuts! HH"
170394,LeXXington,2008-03-12 16:35:00,1928,I wonder if they had special tracks to keep them from bogging down..  Stupid and cool. Hope they had floater suits on.
170449,Chris,2008-03-12 19:06:00,405,"I'd like to know the name of the band playing the background music.    Sounds like Chris Cornell (Soundgarden, Audioslave) singing......does anyone know???"
170561,GNODDY,2008-03-12 22:19:00,163,That is awesome I understand how some people think its stupid but you have to remember these guys are not doing this for the first time they are experienced in how their machines work and how to keep it from boggin down. Plus at that speed you could go for miles.
170564,irishfield,2008-03-12 22:26:00,26272,...till your belt brakes ! .. till you hit that good gulp of water in your Esso Gasoline... etc. Heck we use to cross the beaver ponds on our old Johnson 340's... but ya get wiser with age they say...
170565,Bernie,2008-03-12 22:28:00,3190,"Have done that. Only in a shallow bay though. Was a few years ago. Not much different than powder snow. I think I was on a MXZ 600 at the time. Really don't need a special track, although I hear the powder tracks work very well. Keep the power to it and away you go. YAHOOOOOOO ."
170604,Big Cliff,2008-03-12 23:45:00,6899,"We use to run open water back in the late 60's early 70's when going ice fishing in the spring on machines with a lot less power than those things have. Mind you we only ran short stretches, 40-50'. We were running old Artic Cats, Snow Crusers, SkiDoos, MotoSkis, actually anything that we could get to run. As long as you keep it pinned and your weight back you'd be amazed, you can even make gradual turns. So many lives would be saved every year if the people that do go through the ice just knew what to do."
170633,bassboy,2008-03-13 00:57:00,161," There was another vid there from the same guy that had the name of the band on there......they are called FLUD (appropriately so   )  Amazing vid! Thanks for posting it. I was trying to see what the speedo said but the resolution and video window was too small.  Pretty amazing though, and those guys have cojones the size of Texas  Bill"
170640,bassboy,2008-03-13 01:02:00,161,and then there is this one........  
170652,Gerritt,2008-03-13 01:11:00,6129,Awesome Vids!!! holy crap!   And the tunes? That was Chris Cornell w/ Audio Slave. he has also been with Sound Garden and Temple of the dog...  G
170658,fishindevil,2008-03-13 01:20:00,6254,"Thats some pretty wild video guys thanks !!!!!...man that riding on water is too freaky,that would scare the crap out of me !!!!"
170667,AzuluSpookd,2008-03-13 01:34:00,348,"Three years in a row they do this on GB on April Fools Day.....check out aprilfoolsonline.com and you will see....one of the weber boys....if you get a chance to watch one of the full length videos, you can see via the headcam that at one point they are travelling 127 mph"
170682,irishfield,2008-03-13 01:43:00,26272,That Weber pot of gold is gonna run out of luck one of these days... if the gold don't run out first...
170703,DanTheMan,2008-03-13 02:04:00,257,That's  awesome
170707,AzuluSpookd,2008-03-13 02:10:00,348, Wait til' you see the new boat he's bringing up from Florida....UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
170711,irishfield,2008-03-13 02:13:00,26272,Like I said.. if the gold don't run out first. Reinhart spent/spends it well enough...
