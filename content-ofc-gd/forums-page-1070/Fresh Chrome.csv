Although roe is a productive bait, I have come to find it isen't the be all and end all presentaion but then again no bait is. Try some artificials next time out....you may find yourself leaving the roe behind more often. If you are heading streamside this weekend, remember, saftey first. Peace. "

I always bring a variety of baits and if roe isn't working I'll switch to pink worms or steelhead jigs.  The hard thing for me about steelheading isn't just the bait...it's leader length, shot placement, float size etc....  I'm still learning to adjust based on water depth and the speed of the current.  Also still learning about where they hide at night, during cloudy days, sunny days...the list goes on."
