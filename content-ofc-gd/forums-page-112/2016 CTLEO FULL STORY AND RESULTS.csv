983260,JayClay,2016-10-12 01:33:00,16,"October 10th, 2016For immediate release: On Saturday October 8th, 2016 75 teams composed of 150 anglers blasted off from the Upper Niagara River in Chippawa Ontario in search of the 5 biggest bass they could catch. Weather was a major factor in this year’s event as high winds, big waves and rain met anglers as they ventured out of the river and into Lake Erie. Changing wind directions made travel very difficult and anglers had to focus on the spots they had without running and gunning. In the late morning the clouds gave way to bluebird skies and gave teams at least some reprieve.As the weigh in began it was obvious that the conditions and relatively tough fishing had played a role as a number of teams loaded their boats early without weighing in any fish. As the teams weighing in progressed the 2015 Champions Simon and Melanie Frost came to the scales with smiles on their faces and the scale dropped at 24.89lbs anchored by a 6.31lbs monster smallmouth. It seemed as though the husband and wife duo were destined to repeat as team after team could not surpass their weight. It wasn’t until long time partners Scott Huffman and Rob McIntosh came to the scales that we had a team come close to dethroning the Frost’s. The fish were scaled and a new leader was born with 25.07lbs of Lake Erie Smallmouth! Later in the weigh in the 2014 Champions of John and Perry Poirier came to the stage with another large bag and the scale settled at 23.52 lbs putting them in third place overall, out of that bag also came the new, and overall Big Fish with a giant 6.42lbs!The new live leaderboard let teams see where they sat in the overall standings and was a welcome addition to the tournament. As the final standings and payouts were tallied, the awards for the kids colouring contest were handed out and put rod/reel combos, Canadian Tire Gift Cards, and more into the hands of all the participants! Dirty Pig BBQ severed up some outstanding food while the Monster Energy Drinks Truck handed out samples to all in attendance. In the background during the weigh in the live release team worked diligently to release all of the fish brought to the scales and a brand new bass tagging program was carried out. 100 Smallmouth are now dawning special tags in order to study the recapture points of fish release from the weigh in. The tags carry and identification number with an email address and phone number to call if anyone catches them again.After the final standings had been tallied prizes were awarded by MC Eric Hill and weighmaster Jason Clay to all winning teams. Out of 75 boats a total of 26 teams received cash and/or prizes, with the total payout for the event surpassing $38,000 which is over 235% of the angler collected funds. The cash payout alone exceeded 135% of angler collected funds making this one of the highest payout percentages in Canadian based bass tournaments. Every team walked away with a grab bag filled with goodies. The sponsors of this event deserve nothing but thanks and appreciation for their generous contributions lead by the title sponsor Canadian Tire. Canadian Tire 4th Avenue St. Catharines store owner Pat McMaster attended the weigh in to support all the anglers and see who took home the top prizes.Event Sponsors Include:• Canadian Tire, Shimano Canada, Freedom Tackle Corp, G-Loomis Canada, Fishbum Outfitters, Athens Printing, Mountainview homes, Pure Fishing Canada, Anglers Choice, Carstar Niagara Falls, Jack Link’s, Live Target Lures, Power Pro, Dirty Pig BBQ, Set the Hook, Vigor Eyewear, Ultra Tungsten, The Rod Glove, X-Zone Lures, Niagara Outdoor Show, and C-Tow NiagaraRewarded for their efforts – Winning Team of Scott Huffman and Rob McIntosh with 25.07lbs took home a total value of $7500.00 including $5800 cash, a $1000 Canadian Tire Bonus, and the Pure Fishing Top Team Award!

In 3rd overall with 23.52lbs and the overall big fish at 6.42lbs John and Perry Poirier netted at total of $5,250.00 which include the Pure Fishing Big Smallmouth and Big Largemouth prizes (no team weighed in a largemouth so prizes were combined). The 4th place duo of Sy Phengchanh and John Stathakos with 23.48lbs won $3,700.00 total including the Shimano and G-Loomis Rewards program. In 5th place New York based anglers Joe Fonzi and Larry Mazur netted $1400 in cash!With many contingency prizes to fill out the prize structure additional teams were rewarded. 5 lucky teams took home the Jack Link’s Bonus payout worth $200 each. Partick and Slaw0mir Zajdel won the Freedom Tackle Corp smallest 5 fish limit. The Pure Fishing Mystery weight which is 55% of the winning weight was awarded to Landon Weiske and Kevin Hordyk.

983269,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-12 04:24:00,8243,"Those folks that braved the elements Saturday earned every penny. For those that didn't come into the money congrats to each and everyone of you that braved the elements. We live on the lake about an hour west and I watched those breakers pound the rock wall enough to shake the cottage and that was after the rain stopped. Bass fishing in that, no way. Normally I would say it would be foolish to fish last Saturday but these folks are pro's. 150 fishermen, amazing.  This tourney seems to get bigger and better quality fish caught every year. Great job well done goes out to all the organizers as well.  The Hawg Smallies are on the feed bag right now. The problem is getting to them at this time of the year. The boat is out of the slip, fuelled up and ready for a day that is fishable. I wonder if drop shotting was the ticket for the winners. It is simple fishing in Fall. If someone wants to get a personal best Small Mouth head this way ASAP. Heed your wind predictions. The lake can change in 15 minutes this time of the year. I find Wind Finder for Port Colbourne fairly accurate. Don't forget a 1 meter wave doesn't include the belly, that makes it an 8 foot wave. That's what they fished in, amazing.  If I'm not mistaken Melanie did a show here during the Fall with Izumi a few years back and gave him a lesson in Bass fishing in the same conditions, that Ranger was bobbing up and down like a little cork in the Ocean and he packed it in after an hour and fished better conditions on day 2. That lady knows her stuff for sure.  Thanks for the results and congrats again to all."

983354,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-13 15:49:00,8243,It was Sue Watson that did Bob Izumi's show a few Falls ago and gave him a fishing lesson.
983358,grimsbylander,2016-10-13 16:55:00,3016,I know Mike did a show with Bob jigging for fall smallies on Erie. Geesh I hate that deep water jigging.
