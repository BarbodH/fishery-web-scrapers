984229,manitoubass2,2016-10-23 16:51:00,11391, Hahaha its 95% c&r brotha.  I keep a few feeds in the fall and spring.  Any fish I eat in summer or winter are from different waterbodies

984247,leaf4,2016-10-23 18:14:00,2466,If only fishing that good was as close as it is for you... I'd be out a lot more than I do get haha
984254,GBW,2016-10-23 18:41:00,8460,"hey, bro, um you got a little crappie on your lips and chin there"
984258,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-23 18:49:00,8243,Are you trying to fill the entire free data space of this website? With that crew to feed I would be keeping more than a few fish for sure. You can't put a dent in that fishery.

984268,Tomcat,2016-10-23 20:27:00,395,I took a look at all the pics in your three posts this afternoon. Thanks for taking the time to post those up. Great to see the kids involved. Looks like the kids have a great fishing mentor.
984271,porkpie,2016-10-23 21:20:00,2521,"Nice pictures!  Don't let the Internet get you down.  Years ago I used to take this stuff to heart.  Now I just look at it for what it is, a fun distraction from the day to day. My day to day is full with my Wife and kids, friends and the outdoors, looks like yours is as well.  The guys who let web sites turn them bitter need to rethink things, it's just not that important.  Water off a ducks back!"
984272,chris.brock,2016-10-23 21:41:00,4053," Beauty fish, my favorite is that big ling though.  What's the story with that brown bear?"
984278,pics,2016-10-23 23:08:00,1268,"Wow, you have yourself a baseball team!!.. that's one busy household.."
984282,manitoubass2,2016-10-23 23:45:00,11391,Hahaha i made those knecklaces with all fishing components! Which reminds me I need a new one!  That bear was just northwest of emo at a friends house. I got a bunch more pics too because there was a huge blackbear as well with cubs up in the trees! Super cool to see. I was wobbly pop brave and got pretty close for that picture
984283,manitoubass2,2016-10-23 23:48:00,11391,"Agreed porkpie! Just being ill I was kinda being a debbie downer.  We have 7 kids pics! Some of the others pictured are kids from bad homes, i take em fishing as much as I can just for something positive in their lives. Nature is the best place to unwind and forget the crappy stuff imo"
