983719,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-17 04:05:00,8243,"It is sad to see all the Mom and Pop haunts bow to the shiny corporate places trying to have the vibe of the old places they tear down. If anyone lived in the east end of Hamilton skipping classes and going to the Derby House for a beer in High School was a right of passage. For one reason or another I hadn't been on Queenston for a few years after we moved out here. I'm driving by the Derby and it's a brand new Shoppers Drug Mart! Sad. There were 4 old time hotels on the corner of Queenston and Lake Ave, all gone.  If some of you folks drive to Port Dover in the summer, a great old fishing villiage to visit where the tugs still fish out of. Coming from anywhere you have to travel down hwy #6 or #3 through Jarvis. Both highways cross there. A few buildings north of the corners is a hotel called Branko's. You will think you have gone back in time to the 60's. Same stale draught beer smell and they even sell pickled eggs and Horse sausages in the 1 gallon jugs. Stop in. Don't blink or you miss Jarvis. Branko's reminds me of the old Parkdale House in T.O. and The Homicide (Homeside) on Kenilworth. Luckily there are still a few left in Hamilton."

All my favourite folk singers played there. Not only did a lot of Great talent get their start there. You never knew who would show up and play in with the artist on the billboard. My favourite night was going to Massey Hall to hear Harry Chapin. Then grab a cab (EMPire 6868) to the Riverboat to hear his brother Tom play a set. Before that night was over. Harry and his band had joined in,as well as Valdy, and Murray,and one other (memory of who just escapes me at the moment). They weren't superstars back then. They would sit down and share a beer with you. It would just become one big singalong."

I lived in that survey off of Lake in the late 80's and walked to The Day and Night for a hangover special lunch. The Scottish lady that lived across the street from us was the cook. A pound of ground beef for the meat loaf and 6 potatoes of mashed would be on the plate with brown gravy covering the plate. $3.99. I would ask her when she was making her Shepherd's pie and would make sure I ate there that day. It was the only bar I ever had real homemade Yorkshire Pudding the size of softballs."

I cleaned the rails off the 300 ton overhead cranes with a broom 10 stories off the ground, fall arrest systems? You fell, you died, one kid did. A lock out? Not invented yet. 3rd rails were live, make sure you don't touch that, you will fry. Before that someone watched and yelled to you if a train engine was coming while you cleaned the switches. ""It's unsafe you say, go home I'll get someone else to do it if you are afraid, hey guys this school boy is yeller!"" Ate lunch in the change room under all the work clothes hanging on hooks 25' high on the ceilings. Remember that change house next to my fathers office Fish Farmer.  It wasn't all great."

In 1975 1 hours minimum wage would buy 14 loaves of bread. Today's minimum wage buys 5 1/2 loaves. Buying power for the working family has been cut by more than half due to corporate greed and government taxation. Plain and simple."

983806,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-18 03:01:00,8243,"It definitely was better for a working man back then, by far. We were able to buy a home no matter what age, regardless of 19% interest rates in 81. If you didn't have a net worth of 100K by the time you were 30 you were a looser in the early 80's. Many of us bought homes in the 70's before you were 25. All you needed was 5% down through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp, CMHC. And a job that paid enough that 33% of your gross covered the mortgage. Your wife's earnings didn't count.  Pics I hear you and have empathy. I never in my life reached into my pocket at a Dentists or Pharmacy, ever. I always shook my head when I saw families use a Visa card at those places and thanked my lucky stars. My health care is about 20% of my pension now a month and growing. That wasn't the deal I signed up and worked for, you either. People used to tell me, you are so lucky to have that pension and benefits, luck? I f%^%$^ed earned it, that was the deal. I risk my life, as do you and every person that walk's down that laneway every shift and that was the deal, especially where you are, I do this dirty dangerous job and you pay me.  It feels like after you sign off for your pension you get a letter in the mail saying, oops we made a mistake we over paid you a few hundred thousand bucks over the last 30 years and we are now deducting it from your monthly pension. What's the difference?"

You were fine if you went with 2 grand for the year with even some spending money left over for entertainment. Beer was $4.95 for a 24 including deposit and cheap whisky like Walker's Special Old was $4.80, and cheap wine for sports events was $1.05, wineskins were a must for football and hockey games, living a 5 minute walk from Varsity Stadium and Varsity arena, we hit most of them as a group from the residence.

We sprayed the big pool at Marine Land in Niagara Falls that summer. Some how I was paid brick layers rate that summer. $10.00 an hour. I somehow was making almost as much money as my father that summer who was a Shift General Foreman at Stelco. I got spoiled. I bought a new TR 6 in 72'. Show me a high school kid that can buy a new car today at 18. We had it made for sure except for Bell Bottoms. But I was 3"" taller with those Fat Albert platform shoes. (Getting back to the point of the thread.)  The summer of 72' I got on as a summer student at Stelco shovelling red hot Sinter in Ironmaking. (It was strange 12 years latter most of my Foremen back then were reporting to me.) The CBA was up that August 1st and job class 1, lowest rate, went to 4 bucks an hour, I couldn't get back on at Canada Gunite. A case of 24 was around 7 bucks a case I think, less than 10 bucks for sure. So it is about the same in todays wages if the average hourly labourers rate is 20 bucks an hour.  Big Cliff you post anything you want to, as long as we don't break the rules and get out of hand I think anyone's opinion is welcome. I don't always agree with you old buggers but I respect your opinions. I can't believe there isn't a The Donald thread yet with less than a month to go in the US election.

I have a better new truck now that cost a bigger number and I also make a bigger number.  It's all good. Now I go political cliff. In 79 I filled my gas tank for 17 bucks and we elected joe Clark pc. Minority govt. he brought out a budget that raised the price to 24 bucks.  All the babies kicked him out, called an election, elected Justin's dad a majority. Gas went back to 17 bucks a tank.

My brother put all the Super 8 movies on a DVD years ago, gave all family members a copy and I have to say he did an amazing job of it with the help of my niece that has a degree in Graphic Arts and Computer Sciences. It is professionally done complete with digital Dolby Surround Sound music, sub titles and credits at the end. So we put the movie in the DVD player that Christmas Eve. One of the kids asked my mother ""Nani, how much would that fancy movie camera, projector, screen and lights cost back then?"" Another nephew who owns a Bar commented "" Nono in todays money that hi test you have on that table is all top shelf booze and would cost over $1000.00 today, that's $100.00 a bottle Courvoisier not Brandy.""
