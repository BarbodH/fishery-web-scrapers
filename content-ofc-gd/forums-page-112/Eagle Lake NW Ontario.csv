984235,mj2112,2016-10-23 17:19:00,46,I am planning my 2017 vacation and thought about Eagle Lake NW Ont for late July early August. We are targeting Musky and was wondering if anyone has ever fished Eagle and had an opinion. We still plan on fishing Little Vermillion near Sioux Lookout but wanted to explore new water.
984236,manitoubass2,2016-10-23 17:23:00,11391,Many many times but never for musky  Beautiful area and super productive
984241,grt1,2016-10-23 17:55:00,638,"I've fished it for 25 years in the spring, summer and fall. got muskies while fishing for walleye or trout, you just never know when they will take a liking to your bait. the biggest I have caught was a 39 incher, s few smaller but one guy inour group brought in a musky over 50 inches , too bad it was before the season started, took a long time to revive it but it eventually swam away."
984244,manitoubass2,2016-10-23 18:04:00,11391,Bring walleye stuff too. Its crazy good fishing there. Also rain gear. Its known to get hit hard with some pretty violent storms
984250,leaf4,2016-10-23 18:27:00,2466,"Pretty sure a member lives up near there, old man is his tag I don't know how active he is anymore online though"
984251,mj2112,2016-10-23 18:30:00,46,Thanks for all of the info. I guess I should start looking for places to stay.

984266,Blue Lk,2016-10-23 19:44:00,337,"Any questions,send me a PM"
984288,gordy28,2016-10-24 00:15:00,638,Cant comment on the fishing as i have never been but i have had guys i respect point me in the drection of Birchdale lodge for what its worth
984307,manitoubass2,2016-10-24 01:59:00,11391,Birchdale lodge??? Its possible a duplicate but thats in birchdale minnesota in the long sault of raint river
984327,wormdunker,2016-10-24 06:01:00,1711,"I can't comment on Eagle Lake particularly as I've never fished there.  I will say Ear Falls, which is nearby, is an awesome fishery.  I was fortunate to say I fished the English River in late June of this year & was very impressed by the numbers & quality of walleye.  Contact Rick (Manitoubass) he lives in that area, he'll set up on some fantastic spots."
984453,gordy28,2016-10-25 01:11:00,638,MB Yes Birchdale lodge on Eagle Lake  here is a link http://www.birchdalelodge.com Cheers Gordy
984455,manitoubass2,2016-10-25 01:39:00,11391,Gotcha!  Eagle lake storm a brewin lol  
984483,Blue Lk,2016-10-25 14:05:00,337,"Besides Eagle LK; Cedar Lk & the Indian Lk chain also are well known for healthy muskie populations,Lac Seul is just up the road for world class walleye fishing.These are all less than an hours drive from Vermilion Bay. These lodges are some of the best on the lake Vermilion Bay Lodge Cedar Point Lodge North Shore Lodge Eagle West BirchDale Lodge It all depends on what you are looking for,American plan or Housekeeping plan. There is 1 resort I would not recommend because of past fish & game convictions but I won't name them on here. As I stated earlier PM me if I can help in any way."
984488,AKRISONER,2016-10-25 15:34:00,5558,  wet the appetite
984501,mj2112,2016-10-25 17:17:00,46,"Doing my research on Eagle lake I think I found the place with the game violations. I need the American plan because I fly from Pittsburgh to Toronto, then to Thunder Bay. That's the cheapest route unfortunately.  I appreciate the help very much."
984503,manitoubass2,2016-10-25 17:24:00,11391,Id hit lac seul for at least one day.  Its rediculous good
984551,rides85,2016-10-26 03:11:00,37,"I'm yet to get over to eagle from Kenora, kinda hard to when lotw is at your doorstep. But I have a couple buddies  that fish eagle regularly and ive seen the pics of the giants they catch."
984552,manitoubass2,2016-10-26 03:13:00,11391,Yeah thats tough. Imo LOTWs is the best lake in ontario
