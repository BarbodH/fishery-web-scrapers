983660,GBW,2016-10-16 17:17:00,8460,hey all. the guide on the rod closest to the reel broke so I was wondering if anyone had an idea of what the older rods warranty was.  I don't have the model number with me now but I will when I get home this evening.  It was a nice and light rod that my daughter really liked.  No clue how the ring actually rotted in one spot as she never kept her hook on the ring.  I told her not to as she could knick the ring and cut the line so she listened and never did it again.  Thanks all G

Thanks but for my 13 year old daughter I got her a new rod and she's happy with it (shimano).  I had hope for warranty is all but thanks all"
