983999,RangerGuy,2016-10-21 01:29:00,564,"Man! I wish I knew to ask about that! Would have loved to hear about those stories hehe!  Your close to Rainy? You lucky man!!!  Wish I knew a fellow OFC'r was close! I totally would have met up  Oh and yes, I think I found my dream boat! Once my garage is built I will be working towards get'n into a WX2190 with that yammie!!!  We ran 45 mins 1 way and burned 1/2 tank gas (20 gallons roughly) , incredible for a boat that size and wieght."
984000,manitoubass2,2016-10-21 01:36:00,11391,"Im from international falls dood. Lived my childhood in fort frances. No im in emo smack dab between LOTWs and Rainy lake. Ive fished both all my life(I love these waters)  Im 40 minutes from NW bay rainy lake(retarded fishery)  I also fish porters inlet alot and black sturgeon.  Rainy is just rediculously good fishing year round.  Ive guided the lidners here a few times.  Chris has a chip on his shoulder. He was telling me two years ago ice fishing NW bay. Pros wrecking his gear, rehooking fish for pics etc. And if ya know chris he friggen hates it.  Hes a funny guy, and one heck of an angler.  FYI my cousin owns camp narrows way up on the north arm of rainy. And one of my best friends own rainy lake houseboats right by the thunderbird lodge"

984019,wormdunker,2016-10-21 12:42:00,1711,Awesome report!  I love the walleye pix!  Thanx for posting.  Too bad you didn't hook up with Rick.  I was fortunate enough to meet him in June while I was in the area working.  That area is an awesome fish factory.  I spent a week in Ear Falls before returning home - non stop action!!

984292,GBW,2016-10-24 00:40:00,8460,"thanks for sharing and if you go, make a stop in Lindsay and pick me up please....  lol!"
984304,manitoubass2,2016-10-24 01:38:00,11391,Aaaaand stop by my place!!!
984345,RangerGuy,2016-10-24 13:05:00,564,"Hey everyone,  Thank you for all the comments! Would I brave that drive again absolutely! I got the feeling this was a slow week from talking to a few guys, with the bait moving and the walleye scattering but honestly I did not feel like we had slow fishing.  I have been so busy training my retrievers the last few years, We stepped back from fishing to only on long weekends if there was no trial to compete in and during duck season no fishing at all until December once or twice on Quinte.  I miss it, it`s in my blood! When I`m training my dogs, I`m wondering how the walleye are biting on Nip, when I`m sitting in the duck blind I`m wonder how the walleye are biting..  To be honest our duck hunting as been dismal the last few years, my public spots have dried up for some reason and I am having a hard time dragging my butt out at 2:30 am to drive 1.5 hrs to watch the sun rise and promise my dog the birds are coming LOL!.  Rick I think we should fish together up your way for sure!  Would it not be great to put a group of people together, have everybody meet up there, just throwing it out there!"
984363,adempsey,2016-10-24 14:31:00,1498,"Very nice!  I have yet to do a fall trip out west and would love to do it.  Although, the switch from the rain gear to the float suits made me shiver a bit, lol."
984430,Moosebunk,2016-10-24 23:44:00,3970,"That was a gem of a post.  If it has been awhile, it shouldn't be next time.  Brenda and I are competitive too, and I can see it in Tina's eyes and grin that she loves kickin' your arse on the water. lol.  Cool stuff.  Gives a man an itch to go jiggin' for gold."
984486,RangerGuy,2016-10-25 14:59:00,564,"You got that right Bunk, she sure does!"
