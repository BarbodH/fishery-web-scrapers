It is free to anyone that wants it, pick up only in Lindsay. I also have a recliner chair (about the same vintage) slightly darker in color that is also free to anyone that can use it.

Mom couldn't believe it as she said it's brand new, yep Ma it was brand new in 1989. If I had to do it again I would just take it to land fill and save me many calls and a few head aches."

I guess you are right, I just keep thinking that there are people out there that could use these things and it's such a shame to throw them in the dump. I realize that they aren't brand new but they are in perfect condition. Oh well."
983424,Loonietoon,2016-10-14 12:58:00,1450,Hey Cliff.. you might want to check kijiji free topics people here in the Hammer are looking for free thing mostly young women starting over but might be worth a look at...   Good luck my friend
983426,jimmer,2016-10-14 13:25:00,2730,"There are people out there that can benefit from these items Cliff, they usually don't hear about them though. A Place Called Home, The Restore, Women's Resources, etc."
983427,dave524,2016-10-14 13:41:00,4508,"We get calls monthly from both Cerebral Palsy and the Diabetes associations saying they will have a truck in the neighbourhood on a certain day and ask if we have used clothing or furniture , maybe give them a try."
983507,woodenboater,2016-10-15 00:48:00,2277,"try the Furniture Bank. There's a charge for pick up but they said the tax receipt always covers the pick up fee, otherwise no one would donate. I've never used their services but they give furniture etc away to people who need them ie- Syrian refugees etc.."
983509,DRIFTER_016,2016-10-15 01:08:00,10439,Will you deliver?
983514,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-15 01:54:00,8243,"As long as you deliver it to them they will take it, maybe. The Diabetes folks wanted me to take pics of certain items and email them, you want it or you don't, we were cleaning out 62 years worth of stuff during one of the worse winters in years, kinda busy. We filled a huge dumpster with many thousands of dollars of stuff and paid to dump it. Some gifts we gave them were still in sealed boxes unopened. Found no less than 5 VCR rewinders, 5! 1 for each VCR. 3 Filter Queen Vacuum cleaners that went for 700 bucks way back in the 70's. They weighed 75 pounds each at least, no one wants those old beasts. Many relatives and friends wanted stuff but wanted it delivered too. Uncle Johnny has a truck, Uncle Johnny is old and uses a cane sometimes honey.  If I had have known then what I know now I would have put the house up for sale in spring and left it sit that winter. Then I know we could have helped many families in need, what a waste, it still weighs on me."
983517,GBW,2016-10-15 03:10:00,8460,Call the woman's shelter in Fenelon to see if they can use any of it as well.  I see posts on facebook local buy and sell pages all the time people looking for free things starting over...  So don't trash it just yet...
