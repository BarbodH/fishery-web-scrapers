983497,Roe Bag,2016-10-14 23:41:00,246,"I've got some of those, but when I worry about losing one I usually do. Why do they stop producing proven lures ? Both are still available today.  A designer from Flatfish went off on his own and developed the Kwikfish. Basically all he did was eliminate the tandem trebles and wire spreader. Even the color selections and sizes were the same. luhr jensen bought out Kwikfish.  http://www.cabelas.ca/product/31304/luhr-jensen-kwikfish-lure  Helin's Flatfish was a poor design. Only the larger sizes would cast. The tandem hooks would foul in your line 9 times out of 10 during a cast. Basically  a trolling lure. Worden's bought out Charlie Helin. Now yakima bait has bought out Worden's.. Yakima claims they are the original Helin Flatfish. Although, it seems someone along the line, eliminated the tandem setup on certain models.. http://www.yakimabait.com/products/flatfish/ Hope this helps."

For sure, the Canadian Wiggler runs 12 foot plus while the Flatfish does run shallower, but I've caught way more pickeral off the wiggler than a flatfish/quikfish, including a bunch of Erie fish off down riggers on the 5 of diamonds, firetiger and green/ chartreuse half and half."

Of all the colours of Kwikfish that had to be discontinued, they had to discontinue the most popular and best selling ones: Skunk, pearl, coachdog to name a few  Brian, skunk is hard to beat anywhere but this one has caught me tons of fish on your home river (also discontinued  )  "
983643,SirCranksalot,2016-10-16 14:56:00,3291,The last time I was at Angus HH( about 2 yrs ago) they had a variety of FF. I thought they were still sold elsewhere as well.
983651,BillM,2016-10-16 15:42:00,17367,"Mike, do you run some sort of slip rig with them?  I'm assume they float no?"
983653,MJL,2016-10-16 16:12:00,2427,"Mike, do you run some sort of slip rig with them?  I'm assume they float no?  Bill, If I'm casting, I crimp a few split shots about 18 inches up the line for the k5-k8 kwikies.  With the K9 and bigger they seem to run deeper on their own without additional weight but casting them can still be difficult due to wind resistance.  If I'm float fishing, I bulk shot below the float. I never go above a k5 for float fishing - I find anything bigger tends to be a little too water resistant unless you run massive slip floats.  Most guys I know fishing out of boats prefer to 3-way rig them and back them down.  A Kwikfish out of the box will float. I normally change the factory hooks to a size bigger and sharper - This usually causes them to sink to the bottom nose down, tail up. The factory hooks on the vintage lures suck."
982516,duke01,2016-09-29 21:24:00,20,Anybody ever try back trolling plugs for steelhead? Mainly out of a drift boat on a larger ontario river(with shallow and deep pools). Not asking for spots or anything just wondering if people do it in Ontario. Thanks.
982528,mike rousseau,2016-09-29 22:45:00,4661,You mean hot shotting?  Trolling facing upriver while the current pulls you down river?

982618,Ralph Field,2016-10-01 16:31:00,1018,You need a decent flow in the rivers to make it worth while.

Can you do it any time in the fall or is it better on winter steelhead?  Fall/spring when the water isn't super cold.  You'll need big flows though to make use of that technique (if you're fishing from a boat)"
982644,MJL,2016-10-01 22:11:00,2427,"Did someone say Kwikfish?    I don't own a boat, but do occasionally back down various lures like Kwikfish, hotshots, hot n' tots, wiggle warts, shad raps and river rockers into log jams and hold them there. When the temps are up like in fall or late spring, I prefer casting and retrieving. In winter, I find dropping plugs back and holding them in the current is much more effective than casting. In winter, steelhead really don't want to chase lures. If you have ability to back lures into log jams with a boat, you can do really well even in the dead of winter.  Depending on the lure you're running, you'd be surprised at how little current is required to get decent action out of some plugs (kwikfish being one if you have some weight up the line). Others like hot n tots and wiggle warts require a bit more current to get them down and working."

Others like hot n tots and wiggle warts require a bit more current to get them down and working. I anchor in slow water and just let them dance in the current. K9 Kwikfish  about 100' behind the boat. No need to go deep where I fish. Average depth is 10'. They come up and smash it. Back in the late 60's early 70's a black or skunk X5 Flatfish was the had to have lure for steelhead on the Saugeen. That and a black Willowleaf spoon made by Algonquin if memory serves me well. Kwikfish came some time later. Developed by a designer from Flatfish. He apparently didn't like the wire spreader and the double treble on the bellies of Flatfish. So he started his own company and Kwikfish were born. He's since been bought out by Luhr Jensen as have several others."

I just read this article http://www.questoutdoors.net/skills/castspin/articles/hotshot/and have a question. In the case of rods used, why is the length of the rod handle so critical? The guide/author states that handles can't be any longer than 12-14 inches or they simply won't work properly on the great lakes. I don't understand... Tks  Cheers"
