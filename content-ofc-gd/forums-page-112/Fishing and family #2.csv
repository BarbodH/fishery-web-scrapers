984142,wormdunker,2016-10-22 15:54:00,1711,"Once again, very good job!   Do you ever work?  LOL!"

984145,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-22 16:22:00,8243,"I don't know what sequence they were in, you either gained 15 pounds or lost 15. That's a lot of beauty pics and fishes there my Man.  The Dunker is looking old, when did he grow the grey beard?  Kids are looking great."
984148,manitoubass2,2016-10-22 16:29:00,11391," And as you always tell me,  good thing the kiddos look like mom???"
984192,Tjames09,2016-10-23 04:48:00,664,"where can you fish for Sturgeon, thought most lakes the fish is closed year round."
984206,manitoubass2,2016-10-23 14:00:00,11391, The MNR is constantly in the area and it a general rule they allow a quick photo(although that technically means possession) but its a no no to target them
984214,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-23 14:56:00,8243,That was Shag not Wormdunker. I read Akashag and thought it was a 1st Nations word. ha!
984223,Sterling,2016-10-23 16:10:00,477,"where can you fish for Sturgeon, thought most lakes the fish is closed year round.  Only place I know of is BC, but you have to keep the fish in the water and C&R. In fact the sturgeon fishery is protected by $$$ recreational sturgeon fishing brings."
984224,manitoubass2,2016-10-23 16:14:00,11391,We can legally target sturgeon on the american side of rainy river but ya gotta get US license. Catch and release only  That stretch I fish alot has millions of sturgeon and the co's know there is no way of avoiding accidental catches. They will check your rods though! Pretty easy to tell whos tagetting them if ya got 30lb braid and a 4oz sinker  I also contribute to the sturgeon hatchery which is just up the hill.  The cos know we wouldnt target or intentional harm or keep these fish  Anyone caught doing so for non traditional purposes would likely be strung up by their kneck!
984255,GBW,2016-10-23 18:45:00,8460,the last pic is a very cool one
