983535,singingdog,2016-10-15 10:22:00,1047,"Been out a few evenings this week, and the musky are busting minnows right up in the shallows: 3-5 FOW. Still quite a bit of green vegetation to be found. Could be a good weekend."
983536,leaf4,2016-10-15 10:26:00,2466,On the way to lsc now... Hopefully the same rings true for the river I think that's our starting point
983552,esoxansteel,2016-10-15 14:17:00,1307,"This time of year, with it still been warm, theres usually a final push for fish to stay shallow, and real shallow, from the shore to where the inside weed edge starts, although its usually short lived, the ones i want are over deep water structure or suspended over deep water structure."
983611,Jds63,2016-10-16 03:26:00,1365,"Just got a couple of lakers in a stocked lake up in Haliburton today , trolling spoons with a Dipsey diver."
983649,leaf4,2016-10-16 15:18:00,2466,  This was our only taker yesterday!  Saw Mr Parker (handlebarz) out there guiding as we trolled a couple hundred feet away
983727,AKRISONER,2016-10-17 12:42:00,5558,"crazy enough...the weekend was slow  3/4 for 3 days...tough slugging, i think the fishies dont know what the hell is going on with this october weather, just like me."
983799,Gallie,2016-10-18 00:27:00,1215,We were up that way last weekend and my boat landed 9 in 3 days. Most fish were shallow with some sitting on the deep edge of structure. We didnt get any on the last day either but we had our fun. Ill be back in a couple weeks to look for a big one!
983818,singingdog,2016-10-18 11:19:00,1047,"They were hitting on Friday, following on Saturday, and seemed to have disappeared on Sunday. Dropping water temps? I would have thought Sunday - warm, pre-front - would have been good, but we didn't see a fish. Ah well, lots of time left."
983819,Rizzo,2016-10-18 11:35:00,4754,I hate warm fall weather for musky fishing. Although its a beautiful comfortable day on the water I think the rising water temps throw the fish right off. Gimme a nasty day any day in the fall and I like my odds better
983826,AKRISONER,2016-10-18 12:43:00,5558,"I hate warm fall weather for musky fishing. Although its a beautiful comfortable day on the water I think the rising water temps throw the fish right off. Gimme a nasty day any day in the fall and I like my odds better  this...in my limited musky experience, I have had the slowest days when its warm and sunny in the fall.  I think thats actually a pattern for all fish, my best days are always when its nasty out.  Friday the boats got 6 in about 3 hours.  Saturday it took us fishing from 9 until 9pm until we got one. We went 1/2 and then sunday we trolled for another four hours and only got one."
983850,Gallie,2016-10-18 18:31:00,1215,"  This was our big one for the trip, we got 2 at 43"" Both caught on thursday."
983857,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-18 19:05:00,8243,Packing up the boat right now to head to LSC early in the AM. We need all the luck we can get. I may have put the jinx on us as I borrowed a huge Musky/King net from a friend.
983865,Tjames09,2016-10-18 20:08:00,664,Nice musky Gallie.
983871,Gallie,2016-10-18 20:53:00,1215,"Ty tjames O L first thing at the first spot dip the net in the water, we do it every day hopefully it washes your curse away! Good luck."
983898,Tjames09,2016-10-19 02:34:00,664,what lake and lure you guys using?
983900,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-19 02:46:00,8243,Beauty Lunge Gallie. Always wet the net.
983902,Gallie,2016-10-19 03:17:00,1215,"Those were on a smaller lake in the highlands so i shouldnt name it on here, most of my fish came on double 10 handlebarz black/orange, gold, and green/black. My buddy got one on a big blue fox and one one a believer., i also got one on a sucker under a float."
983909,chris.brock,2016-10-19 04:31:00,4053,"Beauty Gallie! I like the superstition, net wetting too   That's cool, old school, fun fishing. I have a spot I would love to try that. Any tips? how big a sucker?"
983912,Gallie,2016-10-19 10:57:00,1215,"Chris, i know there are more savvy ways to do it but for some reason i continue to do it the same way i do pike fishing. I run a large gamakatsu octopus hook right in front of the dorsal fin on the sucker, i still have my 9"" leader to the hook. I have this comical grapefruit sized bobber that i hook up about 2 feet total to the hook, the key being that when the fish takes it i have the bail open with my thumb on the spool so i can feel the fish. I wait until i think the fish has stopped to turn the sucker around and i give a sweeping hookset always keeping tension on the line. Now, a large slip float would be preferable because the smaller and/or smarter fish seem to know to use the bobber as leverage to rip the sucker right off the hook. They only seemed interested in the biggest suckers i had at the time which were in the 10-12"" range, these were hard to come by but the bigger the better it seemed."
