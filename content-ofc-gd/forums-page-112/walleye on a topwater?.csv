983480,dave524,2016-10-14 22:03:00,4508,"I would catch some off the dock in shallow in the evening on Thanksgiving weekend when cottaging on Haliburton, never during the summer. I always understood that they would come shallow in the fall when the frogs migrate to the lakes to hibernate."
983488,GBW,2016-10-14 22:54:00,8460,Well it IS a kids weekend and we do like to go visit my folks so this time I'm going to pack my fishing gear and not have to rummage through what's in the boathouse...  To bad the last section of dock is out as it would have been nice to be able to cast in a few more areas.
983589,GBW,2016-10-16 00:30:00,8460,Well it looks like it's not meant to be for me so far this evening.  I may try a few more casts in a bit
983595,GBW,2016-10-16 01:52:00,8460,"tried again for a bit, not even a hit. at least I wasn't skunked today as I did get a lil bass before dinner"
983877,Walleye'm Fishing,2016-10-18 22:46:00,310,"I caught a few on Sunday night from shore while tossing a floating rap. Tug, tug, pause... They smash it right at the surface on the pause."
983888,limeyangler,2016-10-19 01:54:00,5204,"Hey Geoff, good thread, never caught one myself on top water. May I suggest a slip bobber, that method would also enable you to determine the depth where you are casting."
983901,GBW,2016-10-19 03:04:00,8460,"Hey Geoff, good thread, never caught one myself on top water. May I suggest a slip bobber, that method would also enable you to determine the depth where you are casting. Hey Simon, thanks.  However I know I can walk 30' out and be only chest deep mid summer and it's all stone/gravel in the area.  When the boats done for the season I'm just happy to cast 100000 cast's with hope at one last fish from the spot.  I just wasn't sure how good a top water lure would be for walleye as I have never tried it. Now with this thread I have other ideas and options when the boat goes to sleep.     I hope all is well up there bud."
983924,Terry,2016-10-19 14:07:00,14456,I don't use top water but when the waves are right  using a lure that doesn't go deeper then 1 ft  I have caught a lot of walleye  and very close to shore.   Most people don't fish with conditions like that. But we get lots of fish
983957,Sinker,2016-10-20 15:11:00,8692,"Yep, me too. Love catching them this way. Usually at night."
982630,GBW,2016-10-01 18:54:00,8460,Just wondering if anyone has tried it and had luck?  Reason being is I'm limited to where I can cast to and it's shallow. Fishing from shore is why I'm asking. Either way I'll give it a shot later this evening.
982631,misfish,2016-10-01 19:18:00,29133,"Top water, slow pulling. Was my first and a surprise.  "
982632,crappieperchhunter,2016-10-01 19:51:00,2582,Every summer we used to go to a lodge near North Bay before we bought our cottage in Bobcaygeon. About our third summer I was informed that there is a good topwater walleye bite after dark in a weedy area of 8-12 FOW.  I never tried it as I have never enjoyed night fishing...but my brother always did well there when he gave it a go.  Give her a go GBW...what are you out?
982633,GBW,2016-10-01 20:03:00,8460,thanks guys.  I'm just visting my folks and the boats done for the year and most of the dock is out.  where they are on the lake isn't that deep but I have had great luck off the dock in the summer with jig's as I can get to deeper water then.  I'll give it a shot either way! *nice fish B!*
982638,206,2016-10-01 21:17:00,563,Got a walleye on a jitterbug on sturgeon off that concrete dock off county rd 30
982648,chris.brock,2016-10-01 23:34:00,4053,I got a big walleye on a black jitterbug on the French. It took 6 half ass strikes before I hooked it.  Let us know how it goes Geof.
982649,GBW,2016-10-01 23:53:00,8460,well the rain started here just after it got dark...  only one bass caught before then and 4 missed fish.  my biggest problem I'm sure was how shallow the whole area is. even with casting as far as I can I was only getting to 7 / 8 ft deep water.  oh well at least I got to take some casts and fight a fish when fishing wasn't planned for today.  glad I have a bit of stuff here as I didn't even bring anything  this visit.
982651,OhioFisherman,2016-10-02 00:58:00,6623,"I never caught a walleye on a surface lure, but have caught them on other types of lures in 2-4 feet of water."
982652,manitoubass2,2016-10-02 01:03:00,11391,"Goeff, I use top waters for walleye in spring fall. All shallow.  One thing ill say is from shore, cast the edges. Casting straight out will likely be naddas  Lotsa walleye sit in a foot or two of water this time of year.  Black Zara spooks and the jr model are my go too.  I know it's too late, just for future reference"
982653,GBW,2016-10-02 01:25:00,8460,thanks guys!
982659,Acountdeleted,2016-10-02 05:38:00,2562,"Had a weird instance about 10 years ago.   We were working/ fishing a lake in Northern Ontario and the walleye were on fire.  One night, the bite stops. Cold. We can't figure out why until we see the  Whoops. Fell asleep before I finished this will edit later."
982675,RHK,2016-10-02 17:11:00,15,Pick this one up over the labour day weekend on Lake Erie fishing a reef in under 5' of water on a poper when it got dark. Was fishing for Small Mouth at the time. A few friends have caught some to on top water baits also but all at dusk or in the dark when the walleyes move into the shallows to feed. 
982684,Weeds,2016-10-02 20:02:00,782,The suspense is killing me. I need to hear the rest of this story.
982685,Joeytier,2016-10-02 20:06:00,3990,"Bahaha, yeah Jeremy don't leave us hanging"
982775,fishindevil,2016-10-03 22:10:00,6254,I have caught 1 walleye on a topwater and it was about 3 lbs it hit a top water popper in the Ottawa river
982778,Weeds,2016-10-03 23:07:00,782,"Jeremy, your still on the hook for the rest for the rest of that story dude."

982785,manitoubass2,2016-10-04 00:12:00,11391,Classic bait end switch! Epic ending???  TELL US NOW!!!
982792,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-04 01:20:00,8243,"Geoff, this last May 24 weekend I towed the boat 7 hours north to a nice little Walleye lake. Day 1 all afternoon and into the evening we trolled, back trolled, drifted, cast, flipped, drop shot, jigged every structure, drop off, point, weed edge, fast water top and bottom, eddies at all depths and all other locations where a self respecting Wally would let me hook my first of the year. Nada, niltch, niema, nienti, niet. That evening our hosts son and his buddy came into camp around 11PM. They limited out off the dock by mid night on black buzz baits. Go figure. The next day we were shoulder to shoulder on that little dock. That's where all the fish were caught that weekend. Good luck Geoff.  Jeremy is still knapping. The ending is ""The bite stops cold until we see the Shark""."

As for Jeremy, I think it's ""the bite stops cold until we see"" the bacon and then it was pigzilla time"
982803,Big Cliff,2016-10-04 10:10:00,6899,90% of all the walleye I caught in the 16 years I lived on Sturgeon lake were right off my dock in 3-5'FOW (our record was 14 walleye in 1.5 hours for two of us)
983218,Beans,2016-10-11 16:00:00,3339,Back in the days when you were allowed to fish off the bottom of the power house dam (north P'Boro) I caught a nice size pickeral using a jitterbug. First cast about 09:00pm.  Some damn thieves broke into the powerhouse and stole some tools and that was the end of fishing there day or night...It is all fenced off now...
983476,Acountdeleted,2016-10-14 21:39:00,2562,"Haha got you all on the edge of your seat and promptly forgot (busy time of the year)  So we notice the mayflies are spawning and dropping from the sky and there is a lot of surface activity. So I look in my tacklebox and all I have is a big, ugly orange topwater rapala.  So I tie it on, thinking I'm getting skunked and I ended up landing 3 walleye before the night was over. All the other guys I was with were shocked"
983477,misfish,2016-10-14 21:43:00,29133,You should of left them hanging on Jer. LMAO
