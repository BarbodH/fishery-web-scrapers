983219,Headhunter,2016-10-11 16:06:00,5703,"My biggest concern was taken care of yesterday. I was concerned that the Jays would be sitting until Friday and might have to face a team that has had no break between games. The Indians took care of that by beating the Red Sox, so at this point, both the Jays and the Indians will have to fight to get their hitting/timing back in place. The other concern, would be playing in Cleveland at night. Our players are quite used to playing on controlled conditions. It gets pretty nasty by the lake in October, let's hope the Jays can handle it. HH"

I have lots of faith is Biagin, Cecil, Grilli, Osuna.....beyond that??? scares me....  This being a 7 game series makes it even more worrysome....still confident they can get it done, but if we lose this series my money would be on the bullpen being overworked and giving up some dingers....

Did they forget that they had a 21 year drought and making back to back post season appearances is more difficult than it looks? Some people...  Enjoy the successes of the team this year, because the Jays will have a new look next year. I'll be VERY surprised if Shapiro/Ed Rogers decides to sign EE & JB for next year, let alone, make an offer! The two guys who helped the Jays win the WC deserve to come back.  FYI: If Rogers/Shapiro had signed David Price back with the Jays, his 17 wins would have secured us a meeting with Cleveland and could have avoided the entire WC shenanigans."

Your comment makes sense if you have an unlimited budget.  But the Jays are operating with a limited budget.  They signed Happ, Estrada, Chavez and another reliever for about the same price as Boston signed Price.  If they had signed Price instead of those four pitchers they would have been out of the post season altogether.   I'll be VERY surprised if Shapiro/Ed Rogers decides to sign EE & JB for next year, let alone, make an offer! The two guys who helped the Jays win the WC deserve to come back.   It would be great to see them back.  But the limited budget comes into play here too.  Stroman, Sanchez, Pillar, Osuna, Travis, etc. are all going to be need to be eligible for big raises in the coming years.  It's pretty easy to say just throw tons of money at all these players; but there is a limit to what they're going to spend on the team."

I'll bet the players didn't have more than 2-3 beer after the game anyway. And the whole thing last for about an hour at the most. Let them burn off some steam and have fun. Enjoy every victory.  I think it's the Canadian hockey fans who look at this and think of guys like Bobby Orr who never looked like he had fun once playing the game. Just put your head down and skate back to the bench after scoring. Don't even look at the Campbell or Wales trophy, God forbid it brings bad luck."
982905,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-05 18:10:00,8243,"As far a budgeting for a roster if anyone here is old enough to have enjoyed and can remember the back to back World Series they won, those 2 teams were bought to do exactly that. From getting Dave Stuart's pitching away from Oakland and Dave Winfield's hitting from the Yanks as well as many key players that were instrumental in securing both championships. Not to mention the base running of Ricky Henderson in the second year if I remember right, tough to do lately. Just the perfect blend of Super Star talent to add to the solid roster that the Jay's had. The second team that won the Series was an All-Star team, they were pretty well all gone by the next 2 seasons. Stienhower's (sic) unlimited millions bought all the Yankees World Series wins back then. If I remember right either Tampa Bay or Florida did exactly the same thing one year back then.

982906,AKRISONER,2016-10-05 18:27:00,5558,"As far a budgeting for a roster if anyone here is old enough to have enjoyed and can remember the back to back World Series they won, those 2 teams were bought to do exactly that. From getting Dave Stuart's pitching away from Oakland and Dave Winfield's hitting from the Yanks as well as many key players that were instrumental in securing both championships. Not to mention the base running of Ricky Henderson in the second year if I remember right, tough to do lately. Just the perfect blend of Super Star talent to add to the solid roster that the Jay's had. The second team that won the Series was an All-Star team, they were pretty well all gone by the next 2 seasons. Stienhower's (sic) unlimited millions bought all the Yankees World Series wins back then. If I remember right either Tampa Bay or Florida did exactly the same thing one year back then. The entire team was dismantled the year after.  I don't know how MLB is structured today i.e. salary caps as is in the NFL.

982907,FrankTheRabbit,2016-10-05 18:29:00,479," Your comment makes sense if you have an unlimited budget.  But the Jays are operating with a limited budget.  They signed Happ, Estrada, Chavez and another reliever for about the same price as Boston signed Price.  If they had signed Price instead of those four pitchers they would have been out of the post season altogether.    It would be great to see them back.  But the limited budget comes into play here too.  Stroman, Sanchez, Pillar, Osuna, Travis, etc. are all going to be need to be eligible for big raises in the coming years.  It's pretty easy to say just throw tons of money at all these players; but there is a limit to what they're going to spend on the team.  I totally agree with staying in their budget, but an offer was never made to David Price. It says to me that Shapiro/Rogers had zero intentions of even signing him. At least make an honest offer and work from there.  The same can be said with EE & JB. They gave Shapiro/Rogers a chance to present them something and they just sat around doing nothing. EE's value just went up, with his 42HRs/127RBIs/99Rs and may have just priced himself too high for Shapiro/Rogers can afford. Their ""wait and see"" attitude is blowing up in their faces."

Do they insult him with a low ball offer?  Perhaps they had no intentions of signing him because they knew that an offer approaching market value was not in their budget.

982911,netminder,2016-10-05 20:09:00,514,"Either one of them would have been insane to sign in Toronto and avoid their first ever chance in their career at free agency. And, to ensure both of them were satisfied with the contracts the Jays would have definitely had to overpay for both.  Why has this even come up as a topic of conversation today?"
982913,jimmer,2016-10-05 20:18:00,2730,Rogers has enough money to sign anyone.  They have a good thing going with a close to full stadium most nights.  They will feel the wrath if they don't manage the signed players properly and drop out of playoff contention in following years.  Sometimes we fans let emotions get in the way of the right decision though. Sound contradicting??? Yup.  So much comes into play with signing 30 something year old players. Enjoying the edge of my seat for now!

It seems quite common for people to think that Rogers should be willing to lose money on the Jays because they have lots of money from other operations.  I don't subscribe to that logic.

Walking him that time would have advanced a runner from 1st to 2nd and loads the bases.  Moving the runner to second could result in a run if the runner on third was thrown out trying to score.  Loading the basis also sets up the possible walk off walk for a hitter that does tend to walk a lot."
982955,FrankTheRabbit,2016-10-06 01:18:00,479," Ya, lots of scenarios. It was really a situation of dammed if you do and damned if you don't. There wasn't a good course of action given the circumstances. But ya, when Jimenez gave up two hits with runners on the corner, Britton should have stepped in to minimize the damage. I think they had 6 relief pitchers last night? Tillman only lasted 4.1 innings.  Toronto Police released a photo of the beer tossing guy. I saw the YouTube video and thought maybe it was a girl, but the video was so grainy, it was inconclusive to me.  http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/newsreleases/36107  Social media sure works quick.

People posting pictures of reporters with big 'x's on their faces saying ""do not talk to these guys"". I  know they've been a solid team all year, but they've never really looked like a good team. And then EE and JB walk off the field last night with basically 0 acknowledgement that this may be their last home regular season (or ever if things continue) game in TO.  I know it's insane to take baseball this seriously, but I've been feeling seriously depressed all month and I have been blaming the Blue Jays. This sounds ridiculous but I don't even really care if they win. Probably because I'm so resigned to the idea that it's very unlikely at this point. They played like such an inspired group last year and then to watch them sleepwalk through the most important regular season games of the year has just completely put me off."
982596,FrankTheRabbit,2016-10-01 00:06:00,479,"Oh for sure. Something definitely dysfunctional.  When Benoit got injured from the scuffle, he basically called out Donaldson and Bautista for reacting to close inside pitches, which resulted with Donaldson getting dinged or more like grazed.  I hope the group can pull together and finish strong or else they will end up alienating a huge fan base. They've build up a lot of passionate fans."

He also keeps balls down rather than popped up.  To me this game is basically a coin toss that will 100% rely on the jays bats either being there or not. September stats say that we will see the jays score 2 runs and be done...while part of me hopes that the relief of not feeling like you are in a total meltdown collapse will allow the guys to swing a little more freely.  Plus, lets be honest here, pitchers have a really really hard time dancing around the edges of the strike zone when the pressure is on...what that means is that youve got a few more pitches that will reach the heart of the plate rather than staying exactly where our bats dont want the pitches to go.  I think thats really been the difference as of late, is that pitchers know exactly where to put the ball against our bats, and 140 games into a season your pitching feels pretty comfortable putting the ball where it needs to be. Come playoffs all bets are hopefully off, all i know is that the jays better score early or the game will be done by the 6th inning.  Personally my gut is telling me that the jays are going to get steamrolled 7-1...but i really hope that they prove me wrong. There really is few things that feel like watching the home side win a big game."

Will allow the Jays to DH Bautista and Saunders. Upton apparently has experience at 3rd too, but I can't see him having more upside than the existing infield depth already on the bench. This move definitely lengthens the lineup and adds a lot more depth. I just hope they can do something about that dumpster fire bullpen of theirs.  While we're here, I just wanted to add that there is no reason in my mind to put Sanchez in the bullpen. Last night he gave up two infield singles and one hard hit double in the 7th. He was still free and easy and in the high 90's with his fastball well beyond the 90 pitch mark as well. The kid has shown no signs of slowing down, and is probably in the conversation for the Cy Young. I think they seriously need to examine whether or not moving him is in any way going to help this team in the long OR short term. Also, why don't these restrictions apply to Stroman?"

981562,netminder,2016-09-15 13:33:00,514,"True, and I remember seeing pictures of team outings and stuff like that. No one buying everyone bathrobes, no one buying everyone scooters. JD did buy everyone cologne after that one incident but... Chemistry seems a little off this year. I know I shouldn't say this, but maybe there's too many cliques in this clubhouse. There's Spanish guys who've been playing this game at this level for how long and still prefer to use an interpreter for interviews? Just seems a little strange if you ask me. Although, there have been teams in the past who've hated each other and still managed to win in spite of each other."
981565,Brettiop,2016-09-15 14:27:00,279,"Been a grind for sure, still in the hunt with just two weeks to play,  We would have killed for this 2 years ago.  The slump is bound to end, the team has too much talent. Just will it be enough to re-take the AL east, that's going to be very tough.  Hope JD is back in the games soon, his presence is needed in the lineup."

981833,Headhunter,2016-09-19 13:48:00,5703,"Bautista seems to be suffering from some form of brain damage! He has always been an aggressive fielder, but historically, he made good decisions. Of late, he has made some baffling running and throwing decisions, that have cost this team dearly. I can't imagine how much money this season has cost him on the free agent market. HH"
981835,netminder,2016-09-19 14:20:00,514,"The problem with Bautista is he's easily frustrated and flustered. He was upset that two throws he made earlier very well could have been outs and then he tried to get revenge on a throw home he should never have made, when he had the chance to get the double play/assist at first.  Kevin Barker was on Dean Blundell's show this morning and I think he said it quite succinctly that they are feeling the pressure and now they're trying too hard. Baseball isn't a game where trying harder gets you ahead. I think some of the boppers need to cut their swings down (in spite of what Zaun says) because trying to hit 6 run homeruns with no one on base isn't working either. This is crunch time guys, make something happen!"

Told myself I would just watch the Jays bat and then go to bed as it was already 11:00. 45 minutes later I make my way to bed lol.  They definitely needed that, to say the least. Especially the pummelling of a pitcher they shouldn't match up well against (Iwakuma who is a  sinker baller with few lefties to counter). Travis now just needs to stop trying so hard at 2nd and just make the routine plays. I said a little while ago that this team couldn't keep leaving that many men on and be kept to under 3-4 runs. Eventually they'd break out. Good to see."

I look over at Boston and I see the Jays of 2015. Not sure what's going on, but all cogs of the team seem to be in a grind. Not because they lost 4-0 tonight against the O's or lost 3-2 the night before, there is certainly something worse off this year than last."

It might not matter where Jose plays next year. A former player was talking about a bench clearing brawl he was part of back in the day. Batter is hit by pitch and next thing they know the pitcher and hitter are going at it and they all run out onto the field and pair up with someone from the other team. Not much else happened and after the game the player telling the story asked his pitcher ""What was that all about?"". The pitcher says that the batter hit a big homerun off of him 9-10 years ago but they'd been in different leagues since and that this was his first chance to ""even the score"".  Little tougher for an outfielder and a second basemen to even things up but they won't forget it either."

Watching some jays game I get the sense that MLB does not want the jays anywhere near the post season with some strike zones, and now the suspensions help my thoughts on this one.  8 games for the Odor is an absolute joke .... it would be the equivalent of a 4 game suspension in hockey or basketball.  Mind you the jays management group is smiling at this and the past few games ... going to make them sellers, and then we can revert back to a large market but small budget team."

I noticed that later on as well. He made no attempt to throw the ball to first. His first priority was to hit Bautista in the face with the throw.  I'll bet there are quite a few suspensions forthcoming from that little fracas. The more I think about it I doubt Bautista gets more than a game - he really didn't do that much wrong. I hope Odour gets 15-20, which I think is deserved considering he was probably going to try to fight Bautista even if he was rounding 2nd while Smoak was on a homerun trot. Pillar is likely to get something as well. Maybe Donaldson too. He came in and tackled like 3 players all at once and spent quite a bit of time on the bottom of that pileup."

They waited until they knew they didn't have to face the Jays again and waited until the last at bat. And it wasn't that crybaby pitcher, who's neck is still sore from watching that ball rocket over the fence. He sure talked a lot back in October. He had his chances but didn't back up what he said. Big tough talkin' pitcher who doesn't have to bat was really quiet.  The league now knows exactly what the Rangers are about. They look for the easy way out.

However, I really liked the look of Martin's swing when he got the walkoff hit. That is the stroke that got him paid in the past. Just slap at it and have it drop in right field.  I hope two consecutive walkoff wins will light a fire under these guys so they can gain some momentum. I haven't seen that dugout so look so serious and business like in a long time. No one looks like they're having fun. They are taking this very seriously, especially for early May. I think they maybe need to take a team trip over to Filmore's to loosen them up a bit and soften their hands. Too many guys gripping the bats way too hard.  They have a tough schedule ahead in the next few weeks with a couple interleague matchups on the way. If they don't keep their heads above water through the middle of May, they're going to come up against Boston and New York for 4 straight series. Although New York has looked a bit like a dumpster fire lately, you can't undervalue inter-division matchups, especially against Boston and New York."

I usually don't agree with Steve Simmons with his articles, but he seems to have summed it up best regarding the departure of Stephen Brooks:  ""I keep wanting to give new Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro the benefit of the doubt and he keeps giving me reasons to wonder. The latest bump in Shapiro’s road came with the removal of Stephen Brooks as senior vice-president of baseball operations. It wasn’t so much that he didn’t want Brooks around — that’s his prerogative as the man in charge — it was what he said about Brooks’ usage of Twitter that indicated he remains rather tone-deaf to the new market he now works in. What Shapiro doesn’t seem understand is he works for a company known for terrible customer service. What Brooks did extraordinarily well was communicate with Blue Jays fans, keep them informed, answer their questions, deal with their problems, make them feel wanted and comfortable. What he did, frankly, was modern and useful and user-friendly. What Shapiro also hasn’t come to grips with is, he’s not in Cleveland any more. This is not a small market. This is a huge media town with four daily newspapers, three national sports networks, two sports radio stations, wire services and numerous websites. You can’t — as Shapiro did earlier this week — have a conference-call interview for a few selected reporters after the Brooks resignation, which only angered some of those not included. You do that and you’re asking for disagreement. And that’s not to mention the Blue Jays ended last season with a Canadian team president, a Canadian general manager and a Canadian VP of business and now have an Indians president, an Indians general manager and an Indians business director. He searched high and low for a GM and business leader but all he really looked at was Ohio."""
966717,kickingfrog,2016-04-17 15:03:00,8333,Shapiro appears to be the only one that knows Cleveland was the hotbed for baseball office staff. This year's Jays are going to be the least effected by this. It will only get worse in the following years and it doesn't look good at this point.
966808,netminder,2016-04-18 16:10:00,514,I'd rather not think about front office stuff and just hope the team on the field performs. Every mistake and misstep Shapiro takes this year is going to be hugely magnified because he came in when the team was on a HIGH. Not often that happens. You'd usually think something bad just happened and the team is re-structuring. Not the case this time.  I'd like to see more Canadians involved in Canada's baseball team too. But when it's one Cleveland guy after the other coming in you start to wonder if there truly is a bias somewhere.

You say that and everyone knows how bad Ortiz is, but have you watched Collabelo up there? After every pitch he pretty much walks back to the dugout. And I thought you weren't supposed to leave the batter's box anymore unless you hit a foul ball.  Good performance again yesterday. Only saw the highlights as it's not an ideal time for me to be watching TV. Good to see Happ shutting up a few of the doubters so far (although I'm sure they're hiding in the bushes waiting to pounce on his first bad outing).  And before anyone brings up Storen, I'd just like to point out that so far in 5 appearances Storen has 3 holds, a save (yesterday) and a loss. In the three holds he's pitched an inning each, and faced one over the minimum. The only batter over the minimum in those holds was a solo home run that didn't factor into the outcome. Right now I'd rather see him than Cecil."

966950,kickingfrog,2016-04-19 16:38:00,8333,Sure individual batters are an issue but they can not step out like before.  Pitchers control the speed of the game. Red Sox and Yankee games are always near the top of time for 9 inning games and when they play each other it often takes close to 4 hours for 9 innings.
966961,John Bacon,2016-04-19 18:26:00,3277,Right now I'd rather see him than Cecil.  Cecil may have found his groove.  Has faced the minimum nine batters for the last three innings (3 one inning appearances).

No expectations to see them 10-0 at the beginning of the season and correct me if I'm wrong, but there haven't been any drubbings. So, that's a good sign. We'll have a really good indication at the midway point how they really fare compared to the rest.  Let's just enjoy the warm weather and some good ball!

967066,netminder,2016-04-20 15:55:00,514,I think the fact that they're a game above .500 while the bats are still sleeping is an excellent sign. The problem they ran into around this time last year was they'd lose 4-3 or win 12-2. They need to keep things in sync this year.  It's been said that you can't win the division in April but you can certainly lose it. So far they aren't losing.
967080,AKRISONER,2016-04-20 18:07:00,5558,has anyone looked at their schedule for the first two months of the season. I would bet they have the toughest schedule in baseball.  We need to remember they have only played good teams so far and are still a game above 500  good stuff!

The guys not named Donaldson, Bautista and Encarnacion need to get more aggressive against fastballs. I know it sounds a lot easier said than done, but the games real simple when you lay off the breaking ball and swing at the fastball. Everyone on that team needs to become good fastball hitters, like yesterday.   Well that was a crappy way to lose the game. Yes, yes it was. While I'm not excluding Thole for blowing that game, the guys at teh plate need to do a lot better. I think they were 2 for 9 or something like that with runners in scoring position?

Any ground ball hit to a middle any infielder shall be ruled an automatic double play. Any other runners are also ruled out if they adjust themselves during the play.   Also under consideration is the let them hit rule. Any batter who swings and misses at a ball twice in a single at bat will be allowed to self pitch the ball to put it into play. If the batter is unable to put a ball into play after 5 attempts then he can throw the ball and attempt to run to first base.

But JB had a nice slide that actually broke up a double play yesterday I believe it was. Perfect slide just before the bag, directly over top, reached back to hold on and still managed to put his feet into the second baseman. Of course it was reviewed but what do you expect with the way the rule is written. That will be displayed as the standard for the only way to break up a double play from now on.  Glad to see Estrada still in fine form. It's amazing how an 89 mph fastball can look about 99 when your changeup is so effective. Makes me wish I understood the changeup as a kid learning to pitch.

Too frustrating this early on to pay this close attention. Martin, Tulo, Colabello all ice cold. Still trying to sort out the bullpen... No one can hit past like the 3rd inning when you should be mashing against opposing bullpens. They're currently 27th in the majors as a team in batting average. I know it's a marathon not a sprint, but it's nice to bank some of these games early on, especially when your pitching is over-performing and your bats haven't started running on all cylinders yet.  They'll turn it on eventually. I think they need to get out of the division for a few series just to alleviate the pressure and let them get on a roll. Unfortunately all but two series this month is against the east.  Maybe I should just watch the Stanley Cup playoffs for a couple months and then start watching baseball again.

965245,kickingfrog,2016-04-04 22:02:00,8333,Might be a little harder to get tickets this year. At least in the last minute way I have the last few years. My son is 7 and is just now getting into baseball and is playing it for the first time. We'll see if that gets him more interested in going. I'd love to do a little road trip in a few years and take him to a few ball parks to see the Jays play on the road.
965274,David Chong,2016-04-05 00:47:00,836,This will be a fun team to watch! Michael Saunders will be a lot better than most people expect him to be. Having Tulo for a full season and healthy should scare more than a few opposition pitchers. And his defence...
965389,Beans,2016-04-06 11:54:00,3339,We was robbed !!!...First you can't slide into the catcher if he is blocking the plate... now you can't touch the second base man to break up a double play...Baseball is becoming a game for pussies...
965398,netminder,2016-04-06 12:44:00,514,"I don't understand what happened yet. Someone from MLB needs to come and say exactly what he did wrong. Make a Brendan Shanahan style video. Not even joking - this could be a great learning experience for the entire league. That is, if they continue calling this play the same way 3 months from now..."
965422,Joeytier,2016-04-06 14:53:00,3990,No way in hell he interfered with his ability to get the ball to 1st...robbed is right
965448,Brettiop,2016-04-06 16:29:00,279,"They got the call right, as the rules are written.  But i dont agree with the rules.  If Jose would have kept touching 2nd base, he would have been safe"
965450,jimmer,2016-04-06 16:36:00,2730,"Bautista was not safe, it was the guy on first being called out because of the interference by Bautista.  Sucky rule. They're taking the excitement out of the game."
965452,kickingfrog,2016-04-06 17:02:00,8333,MLB will have this rule kicking them in the pills all season. Remember  when the nhl changed  the skate in the crease  rule in the late '90's and then chose to ignore the rule on a overtime cup winning goal?
965454,Brettiop,2016-04-06 17:04:00,279,"Bautista was not safe, it was the guy on first being called out because of the interference by Bautista.  Sucky rule. They're taking the excitement out of the game. Your correct i meant the runner on first."
965455,Acountdeleted,2016-04-06 17:12:00,2562,"That was an absolute disaster. 2 runs called back that cost the Jays the game. Its really unfortunate, Sanchez was absolutely brilliant.  Of course all of this could have been avoided if Cecil didn't decide to take the night off."
965480,netminder,2016-04-06 19:42:00,514,"That was an absolute disaster. 2 runs called back that cost the Jays the game. Its really unfortunate, Sanchez was absolutely brilliant.  Of course all of this could have been avoided if Cecil didn't decide to take the night off. first earned runs allowed since fathers day 2015? Cut the guy some slack! It wasn't Cecil or even Bautista that cost them the game. They had way too many opportunities score and couldn't cash in. THAT'S what cost them the game."
965486,Thrilla,2016-04-06 19:58:00,164,Yep Cecil has been lights out. Can't blame him for giving up 1 homer lol  Donaldson injured. Hopefully nothing serious!
965492,Acountdeleted,2016-04-06 20:29:00,2562,And another blow save. Jays should be 4-0 right now.  Donaldson was just a strain. Day to day. Thank goodness.  (My pet peeve is blown save. I over react a little but I am more critical of relievers then I am of starters)
965516,muddler,2016-04-06 23:02:00,623,"The first 20 games or so don't mean a lot. Pitchers finding their rhythm and hitters finding their strokes. Remember that you don't want the team to burn out by August.  We will get our share of these same types of wins. These losses were NO blow outs. They were good indicators that this team needs a little tweaking here and there( as do all the other teams). That's the manager's job. It's 162 games, and a lot can happen, remember last year?  I like what I see for the most part. This is a very good team. I have high hopes for them this year too,  My 2 cents.........muddler"
965527,FloatnFly,2016-04-06 23:44:00,1640,"first earned runs allowed since fathers day 2015? Cut the guy some slack! It wasn't Cecil or even Bautista that cost them the game. They had way too many opportunities score and couldn't cash in. THAT'S what cost them the game.  pretty much.  i mean what almost 40 strikeouts in 4 games, not good"
965529,FrankTheRabbit,2016-04-06 23:47:00,479,"4 games in, long season. It's probably been beaten to death, but strong pitching will always beat strong hitting.  So many things can happen from now till Oct. I'm still not a fan of Shapiro/Rogers & Co., but it's still nice to watch them play again."
