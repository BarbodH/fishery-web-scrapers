984397,DRIFTER_016,2016-10-24 19:46:00,10439,Finally got out for a little late season laker and pikes fishing. Been fighting the flu for the previous 3 weekends and missed out on a bunch of good fall feedbag fishing. So on Saturday I got out with one buddy to fish my lake and we had a pretty good day landing 2 pike and 14 lakers between 4 and 10#'s. We even had a double header. Seems I missed the voracious pike bite when I was ill.        Got out with another buddy on Saturday and we managed 19 trout and 0 pike. Size was the same 4-10#'s. We even got another double header. This was the last trip though as the launch bay was pretty crunchy and will be solid by next week. Watch in HD.        All in all a stellar weekend with more than 30 lakers landed and quite a few lost plus a ton of bumps and short strikes. Gotta love the late season pre-ice bite!!! 
984398,Joeytier,2016-10-24 19:50:00,3990,Awesome.  That would be a pretty late ice-up for around there would it not?
984399,grimsbylander,2016-10-24 20:05:00,3016,This is for sure the best time of the year IMHO. The complete lack of cottages around the lake is awesome.
984400,misfish,2016-10-24 20:12:00,29133,Looks like there was ice broken up earlier Dave. Hunters?  Those are pretty fish.
984403,manitoubass2,2016-10-24 20:37:00,11391,You and the lakers man!!! Seriously jealous!  Livin in paradise man!!!
984407,DRIFTER_016,2016-10-24 21:04:00,10439,Looks like there was ice broken up earlier Dave. Hunters?  Those are pretty fish.  Cabin owners mostly. But the ice in the back bays of the launch bay were broken up by boat and wind on Saturday. There were sheets of ice scattered all over the bay on Saturday. Saw one other fishing boat and several going to their cabins but now hunters. There were plenty of ducks about though. Would have been a good couple of days hunting for them if I wasn't after the troots.
984410,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-24 21:17:00,8243,"Thanks for the fishing report. You nut's or what Dave? Even your first mate questioned the route. I have never seen an Arctic Ice Breaker with a bow mount electric before. Yea you guys up there have to be a bit nuts, a good nuts though. I love it.  The leaves on the trees here haven't all changed colours yet."

984432,Moosebunk,2016-10-24 23:47:00,3970,There!  That wasn't so hard was it Dave? lol  This was the first year in awhile that it felt like there just weren't enough lake trout in my season. Scrappy greys make happy days!
984441,DRIFTER_016,2016-10-25 00:29:00,10439,There!  That wasn't so hard was it Dave? lol  This was the first year in awhile that it felt like there just weren't enough lake trout in my season. Scrappy greys make happy days!  The rest of the year I only got to fish 3 times for a couple of hours here and there. This helped to make up for that.
984451,Jds63,2016-10-25 01:04:00,1365,Thanks for that Dave... I can never get enough of laker fishing ...
