984559,DanD,2016-10-26 12:15:00,2223,"Angling sports do carry a crap load of stuff; but the one time I was in there, I felt like I was out of place. As in after 20 or 30 minutes of browsing (like I said they have a lot of stuff) we were never approached by a sales person. My buddy was looking for a floater suit (he's a big guy) and there was nothing on the racks that would fit him. Went up to the front where a few people were hanging around and again we were not acknowledged that we were even there? So we walked out just like we walked in; invisible to the store and staff?  Dan.  Just went to their web site; under the tab profile it says this. I felt the difference. LOL "
