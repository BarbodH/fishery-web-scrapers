983527,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-15 06:26:00,8243,"When I was working shifts or a shut down my work clothes weren't even brought into the mud room until time to throw them in the wash. More chemical smells than body odor. Then the company agreed to do all the outer wear laundry at the plant for guys in our department. Many families reported that rashes and all manner of ailments and allergies of family members suddenly stopped. That was something that was a good that management begrudgingly agreed to. We wore 100% wool underwear winter and summer for both the severe cold and severe heat. How does this new stuff hold up to the heat? It should work both ways.  If you younger guys are still working and are exposed to chemicals and designated substances, including diesel fuel Rick, especially with young children, think about an old second machine for your work clothes. I know it sounds silly at first but think about it. I have been out of the loop so long some companies may launder work wear for you guys."

Once its there its there Use lestoil. Oil base stains don't have a chance.bee using it for 30+ years on my work clothes and cleaning the washer out.

983386,mike rousseau,2016-10-13 22:39:00,4661,"Hey gang  Looking at getting under armour base layer  Can't decide between 2.0-3.0-4.0  Also im 6'4"" about 300 pounds... anyone close to my size own this product to help me with sizing?  Any feedback on this product would be appreciated  Thanks"
983387,manitoubass2,2016-10-13 22:49:00,11391,"Dont order it mike, trust me. Their sizing is odd  Go to a place you can try it on  Abd fyi i still like helly hanson better"
983388,misfish,2016-10-13 22:51:00,29133, Abd fyi i still like helly hanson better  What I have been using the past 2 years. No complaints.
983390,mike rousseau,2016-10-13 23:03:00,4661,I have the helly Henson one piece as well  I want this for a base layer
983392,manitoubass2,2016-10-13 23:11:00,11391, And get their socks while your at it!  Ive had my under layer for 9 years and its still does the trick like a boss  I initially bought my gear for winters in the oildfield waaaay up in northen alberta  Trust me its top notch gear
983398,Dan668,2016-10-14 00:25:00,1120,"I use merino wool as a base, icebreaker to be exact, synthetics will have an odor rather quickly. Sizing wise i would suggest to try it on,  i went by the charts and they didn't fit well. Im 6'1 240 and wear a 2xl shirt."
983399,crappieperchhunter,2016-10-14 00:40:00,2582,", synthetics will have an odor rather quickly.  I have under armour as a base layer. Wear it pretty much every weekend all fall and winter. Bring it home and hang it up to dry then wear it again the next weekend and repeat and repeat. Doesn't get washed for months. NEVER had an issue with odour.  But to the OP's question. Love this stuff Mike and wouldn't do without it. However I can't help with sizing or which version I have. It's probably 10 years old and the writing inside has long been unreadable. However the version I have has the longer cuffs that pull over the back of your hands and has a thumb hole for your thumb. Really like this feature."
983402,Smokercrafty,2016-10-14 01:37:00,227,Been wearing Baffin base and mid layers for a few seasons now. Never knew what I was missing! Never go w/o ever again.
983405,Fang,2016-10-14 01:43:00,1330,One of the best places to see a good selection is Marks They carry a good selection and most guys I know that work outside year round get their stuff there
983419,wormdunker,2016-10-14 09:38:00,1711,"I also wear Icebreaker merino wool long johns & long sleeved undershirts.  They are very warm, cozy & nice fitting.  I hardly know I have them on.  They are also odor free after wearing them several times.  Also if wool gets wet, it is still keeps you warm.  I'm 5' 11"", 200 lbs.  I wear XL."
983430,fishindevil,2016-10-14 14:00:00,6254,I got my under armor base 2.0 at marks work warehouse and I wear it for fishing and snowmobiling at -30 and have for years ....they work and are great...yes don't go by size chart you have to try them on mike...I also have a thin marino wool 2 piece but I like the under armor better well worth the money at -45 winchill on my sled doing 80 miles per hour....
983435,the spirit of fishing,2016-10-14 14:30:00,141,"I suggest you look at what some of the others are recommending. Prior to retiring part of my job entailed outfitting people for specialized needs. This included setting them up with Under Armour base layer clothing. The sizing was crazy. An average sized guy less than 6' with a 32-34' waist could not get on a medium or large size bottom and would be swimming in a small size top. Everytime someone was given their stuff they'd think we were playing a joke on them because the sizes were so unlike what they were used to having. Often to appease them we'd give them the size they thought they were and without fail they'd come back saying they couldn't even get it completely on. There were also times tops had to be replaced because the odor could not be removed, even after multiple washings. If you decide to go with UA you better try them on first."
983442,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-14 15:23:00,8243,"Crappieperchhunter, man if you wear the same underwear unwashed for months how would you know if it smelled?"
983445,musky_hunter,2016-10-14 15:34:00,328,"great layer.. i am 6' 250 and wear xxxl, and its tight. you best go and try them on at BPS or Cabelas."
983451,mike rousseau,2016-10-14 16:38:00,4661,Well they're probably too small for me then
983466,FrankTheRabbit,2016-10-14 19:17:00,479,"I've had a chance to try out a few different brands, including Under Armour. Best bang for buck value are the Helly Hansen body wear.  Providing a link below to give you an idea of what they look like and for the price, just can't be beat. And they're warm.  http://www.dynamicaqua.com/helly.html  I think the best idea is to find out what your activity output is. For snowboarding/high output activities, you'll need one that provides you the best sweat management system. As we all know, when you get wet, you lose heat. If you're mostly going to be stationary, get the thickest one and just layer accordingly. And you should probably take into account what your own body generates heat. I know some people who just never get cold and with others, the total opposite. IMO, purchase accordingly.  Synthetics are great, durable, and dries fast. The only bad thing I can think of with synthetics is some people report them not smelling too great. Really, it's body dependant. Pros for merino is that they're natural, very minimal body itch in fact SUPER comfortable, and doesn't retain the stink that synthetics can. Cons being: Expensive and they don't dry as quickly as synthetics."
983487,Sinker,2016-10-14 22:53:00,8692,This is the stuff right here.  I won't give UA a single dime.  Icebreaker is way better anyways.  S.
983500,farsider,2016-10-14 23:52:00,456,"I use Merino Wool as well but, I use Woolpower.  It is Milspec for some countries.  No smell.  Great wear and feel.  Just a shell on top and whatever layers the day requires.  https://www.canadianoutdoorequipment.com/woolpower-ostersund.html  Cheers, Mark"
983518,crappieperchhunter,2016-10-15 03:11:00,2582,"Crappieperchhunter, man if you wear the same underwear unwashed for months how would you know if it smelled?  LOL. Debbe has an AWESOME sense of smell. If it was a problem my UA would have been turfed or washed millenniums ago...trust me on that.  The fact that it hangs on a coat tree in the bedroom for months on end without being washed or thrown out is all the proof I need that unpleasant odour is NOT a problem.  Merino wool gets a HUGE nod from peeps I respect...like Sinker....but since I have not gave it a go myself I can't truthfully evaluate. BUT....when I bought my UA merino was MUCH more $$$$...like 3X's the cost... so I went with UA...cause I'm close to my dollars"
983520,manitoubass2,2016-10-15 03:40:00,11391,All my gear smells like diesel. I deal with it lol

983525,crappieperchhunter,2016-10-15 04:52:00,2582,LOL X2. As I wipe tears from my eyes.  Thx for that. And perhaps we should  leave this discussion at that.  Onward and upward....
