At the time Gadhafi was a small problem if a problem at all.  He had cancelled all his expansionist ambitions and was actually helping the U.S. with intelligence.  As bad as Libya was by western standards it would have been on the short list of places to live in the ME then but not now.

Reading all sources of information both the good and the bad gives you balance and allows you to identify what is the consensus of opinions among like minded people. That is what the thread is about.  Art  I did way more then a wiki search. I searched the author and the title and went to every reputable website that stated anything about either topic. Since there was little reputable information I expanded out from there to sources like the National Enquirer simply because information was sparse. It was very clear that, ""The Secret Life of Barack Hussein Obama"", has no merit as a source of information whatsoever. It was so bad a citation that I thought it obvious, by association, that the book list cited all comes into question. People who are truly interested in the truth such as scientists or academics take the utmost care NEVER to have bogus or blatantly biased sources when they reference others to information sources. If you like I can dig further into that book list but how many books would have to be propaganda before all of them come into question?  Finally, to be educated on a topic doesn't mean that one must read, ""all sources of information both the good and the bad"" to give you a balance and help you find the consensus viewpoint.  ""Consensus"" isn't a numbers game where the most citations is considered the consensus. For example so much has been written about how homosexuality is a learned behaviour and that it can be unlearned with the ""right"" teaching. The majority of information on the internet on the causes of homosexuality may back up that claim but no expert in the field would support that as a consensus position. Nor would you have to read all the information about how homosexuality is a learned behaviour to be informed. Bogus information can simply be ignored.  If debunking is not allowed, and truth and fiction have equal weighting on this thread, what are we really doing?"

983796,aplumma,2016-10-17 23:34:00,6896," Talking about Media bias....  I'm guessing the list above is a great place to start for Media bias. To fact check I started with ""The Secret Life of Barack Hussein Obama"", written by Mondo Frazier. Simon and Schuster who published the book states about the author, ""Mondo Frazier is a graduate of West Liberty State University, Mondo Frazier is founder/editor/writer at Death by a Thousand Papercuts and has published more than 2,000 articles online"". Death by a 1000 papercuts is an online blog of poor quality. He gives us nuggets such as this post,""The Bible says that in the end times, it will be mostly fables which are believed. Here are five of the most popular fables told in the those buildings known as the churches"".  There is no credible review of his book. The author doesn't even rate a wikipedia page. The only known quantity to review his book is the National Enquirer, ""The explosive tell-all by take-no-prisoners blogger Mondo Frazier reveals the command­er in chief is a “chain-smok­ing wreck” who could be hooked on prescrip­tion drugs, and claims he may have spied for the CIA in col­lege"". The author goes on to boast, “I’ve uncovered that Presi­dent Obama has spent over $2 million in legal fees to keep the details of his past hidden,” Frazier told The ENQUIRER. “This new book will surely impact his re-election campaign.”  In a nutshell we have a nutbar who authors an Obama hatchet job and a major publishing house publishes his book and brags about a blogger/author??!  Neo-cons seem to believe anything if they are fed by the right teat. That anyone would still think that the Birther movement isn't dead, or push titles such as the ones above prove my point. We now have industries of misinformation for profit and flat out propaganda. Hitler and Gobbles would be proud. That Paul Ryan can get up and say that 70% of the American people want change and then fail to be at all accountable for his own parties failings in this regard is totally mind boggling. People don't want the Bull crap anymore. This is the type of posts that will get this thread locked. Refrain from debunking or flaming people. If you have knowledge or a point of view then share it. It is up to each person to do what they want with it. We do not tolerate bashing or debunking other opinions it takes the threads into hurt feelings and people ganging up on each other.

983755,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-17 18:29:00,8243,"T Bone has hit a nail squarely on it's head. How can 1 person rule the world.  Canadave, that Joe McCarthy statement you made saying it has been proven he was a great American patriot has me questioning anything you may write in the future. From what I have read over the years my take is he was a delusional racist. I am going to go out and read that book though before I make any statements to the contrary about McCarthy. 60 Minutes just yesterday did a piece on the Rosenberg's. Guilty, darn right they were, but Mrs. Rosenberg's crimes did not warrant an execution that was based on fabricated testimony given during the trial. That admission of perjury came from the lips of the witness that committed the perjury, Mrs. Rosenberg's own brother whom she recruited."

983759,Canadave,2016-10-17 19:08:00,62,"Old Iron Maker  .. I hope you do read that book.  I fortunately came across it accidently in a thrift store in Alabama two winters ago.  The information is highly researched and documented.  The Rosenbergs gave atomic information to history's second greatest mass murderer Joseph Stalin which enabled the U'S.S.R. to develop the atomic bomb.  That being the case I hope they were slow roasted in the electric chair.  What's very scary is that Robert Oppenheimer, the head of the Manhatten project was also likely passing on nuclear secrets to Stalin.  Soviet moles in the American government at the time were estimated at over 300 and the State department was the most extensively infiltrated. I checked it out for you and it's available on Amazon for $1.26 plus $3.99 shipping.  If you do get it let me know what you think."
983760,Canadave,2016-10-17 19:22:00,62,"manitoubass2  It's scary that a total fraud like Obama was elected twice and a pathological incompetent liar and power monger like Hilary will likely be the next Prez.  Joe Biden is nothing less than a clown and he made it to the number 2 position.  John Kerry is also a narcissistic con artist and could have been court-martialled for incompetence.  He was hated by the men under him (read the Swift Boaters) when he as a 90-day wonder commanded a swift boat in Vietnam.  He recommended himself for two purple hearts for scratches that wouldn't require a Band-Aid.  I'm old enough to remember him making a speech as an anti-war demonstrator, accusing the American troops of being war criminals.  The head of the Romanian KGB who defected to the U.S. in 1979 stated that that lie was created by the KGB of the Soviet Union and there was Kerry being their useful idiot mouth piece and he made it to Secretary of State."

983767,netminder,2016-10-17 20:20:00,514,"Right now, I don't think anyone is at liberty to believe anything either side says about the other. As far as anyone is concerned, the person they aren't voting for might as well be Satan him/herself. And in this day and age where everyone lives in a nice cozy echo chamber where their opinions are never refuted and their bias is constantly reaffirmed there's no way to change anyone's opinion. It's become so much us against them. There's plenty of evidence that the GOP made a conscious effort to disagree with everything Obama tried to accomplish, even things they agreed on. There's a classic case just recently where they over-rode a veto on a bill that was intended to allow victims families of 9/11 to sue Saudi Arabia because they apparently sponsored terrorists. But in turn it would in-turn allow foreign countries to sue the US for terror related issues such as civilian deaths during bombing raids. They then immediately regretted doing so, but tried to blame Obama anyway because he didn't express exactly how against it he was, as if a veto doesn't quite get the message across. I wouldn't at all put it past the Democrats to do the exact same thing if Trump were elected (be it for good reasons or not). It's too bad this is the state of affairs we live in now, where progress can't be made because of how much we disrespect the other ""side"" and are so willing to believe every negative thing said about them simply because we don't like them and it sounds true. Even fact checkers can't be trusted, because if they say something isn't true or the facts don't agree with what we think should be true, they're obviously biased.  Thanks for letting me vent. This us vs. them mentality needs to stop. The world will not end just because of an election. The whole thing has been a major black eye to the US and the state of democracy everywhere."

If/when Trump messes up he would be chased off in a short time and a very capable Pence would become president.  Hillary is certain disaster.

If Trump does win Congress and the Senate will be in the hands of the Democrats and they will block every bill just because they can.  The Republicans knew exactly that allowing law suits against the Saudi's would open the US government to law suits for co-lateral damage during military action, what a mess that will be. It might be the right thing to do though. You bomb my home and kill my family because you missed and I get a general apology from the State Dept? That won't re build my home or bring back my family but a few million US dollars may help. They might think twice before they pull the trigger then.

Since the end of the Cold War, KGB records and records from the Venona Project, a CIA counter-espionage project at the time of McCarthy proved that every name McCarthy mentioned, were in fact KGB agents including Alger Hiss and the Rosenbergs that the left to this day love to genuflect to.

983678,Spiel,2016-10-16 19:43:00,9065," I haven't been here for a few years but if you remember me you know I love to rant and with informed opinions.  I research the financial and political scene for at least 3 hours per day.  I first became intrigued about Obama when he made his keynote speech at a Democrat convention while still a State senator.  I was shocked to see his audience of clapping seals screaming their approval as if it was at an Elvis concert but his speech was nothing less than a long list of meaningless cliches, slogans and buzzwords.  It would have made a good Saturday Night Live skit ridiculing politicians.  I was so intrigued that I have since purchased over 20 books on him.  Likewise, I have 6 books on the Clintons.  There are only two things you need to know about Hilary. Number one, withing 2 days of Slick Willy's first election she actually stated ...""WEEEEE are the President"". That must be the first time in history that the spouse of an elected national leader is automatically included as a co-winner.  Not being a shrink I'm not sure if that means she's a narcissist, a sociopath or a psychopath. I have read opinions of psychiatrists who conclude that she is at least one of the first two.  Don't take my word on it, just do your own homework.  Also, do your homework on ""Chinagate"".  In a nutshell, The Clintons after receiving a huge contribution to their Clinton alleged foundation, immediately loosened the foreign trade rules that allowed the Chinese communists to get secret missile technology that they needed for their ICBMs which enabled them to more accurately target American cities. When an investigation began, suddenly Americans involved took the 5th and Chinese nationals involved immediately fled home to the People's republic to avoid arrest.  Call me silly but I believe that used to be called high treason.  The law pertaining to Hilary's emails is very specific ... United States Code: Title 18. Section 2071:  (a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record filed…in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. (  Whoever, having the custody of any such record, unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. Hilary was forced to admit that she deleted tens of thousands of emails the majority of which was government correspondence and we now know included top secret information.  TheDemocrat government is so corrupt that even the head of the FBI said she should not be prosecuted because they didn't know her intent.  The obvious escapes him.  Anybody else would be in prison by now.  At a very minimum, that law says that she could never hold ANY government office let alone the Presidency.  I'll spare you the long list of Clinton crimes and incompetencies.  Her admission to her deleting emails is all you need to exclude her from office. Trump is the last of the Republican candidates that I would have chosen but he is the only one who has addressed the issue that has most concerned me going back literally decades and that's the huge trade deficit that is killing the country.  It's now at 700 BILLION annually.  The U.S. now has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. No wonder companies have fled the country in droves and continue to do so .  At least Trump understands business while Hilary is a die hard redistributionist.  Her track record is one of endless failures.  When the country is at stake who cares about Trump's alleged womanizing.  Those accusations are now falling apart.  Compared to the rapes and assaults of sex-obsessed Bill Clinton and Hilary's defence of him while bad mouthing his victims all the while claiming to be a supporter of women.  The decision becomes obvious.  Sometimes you just have to hold your nose and vote and not worry about the predictable accusations of the left of predicting the world will fall apart and there will be a nuclear war next week if Trump is elected.  Prince Justin is another rant.     "

Not so sure about Ryan as his VP, but would be better then Kaine.  If Hillary wins we'd be stuck with her for at least four years because her loyal followers will overlook anything she does to our country.   Democrat House and Democrat Senate would vote almost 100% to allow her to continue her term.  I'm not positive what Trump would do as president, but there's a chance he would surround himself with good people and I'd be hoping they'd do whatever it takes to keep him in line.

Since the end of the Cold War, KGB records and records from the Venona Project, a CIA counter-espionage project at the time of McCarthy proved that every name McCarthy mentioned, were in fact KGB agents including Alger Hiss and the Rosenbergs that the left to this day love to genuflect to.

983612,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-16 03:26:00,8243,"If we can keep it civil between us, no name calling, no calling each other out I think we can make our points and give opinions before Art locks the thread.  When Trump announced his candidacy I thought it was a publicity stunt, then when he won the GOP party nomination I cringed. When he pulled even with Clinton I started to really be concerned about our future. I will only say this (yea right) I personally think he is a threat to the human civilization. I can't fathom 50% of the voters in the United States of America think he would make viable President and leader of the free world. Within the GOP major leaders think he is a menace and security risk as well. More citizens of this world and more than the entire population of the US feel the same way.  If Donald Trump had a CEO of one of his own companies that said the things he does and acted the way that he is acting he would turn to him, point his finger and say ""You're fired!"". Simple as that.  I don't think Hilary Clinton fits the bill either. She has baggage that weighs on her and she seems to be as trustworthy as Trump is. If Pence was running for President and he had someone other than Trump running as Vice I might cast my vote for him. He seems to be the only class act in this whole charade. His support of Trump makes me suspect of his mental stability though. Now Pence hasn't been vetted the way those two have so I really don't know him as well. But as I said he seems to be the only person there that may have the right stuff. The problem in this election ""may have the right stuff"" isn't the confidence I want before I go into a voting booth. Not much of a choice for our friends in the USA.  Keep it civil please. Lets take the high road."

Either way they are going to be a bunch of party faithful holding their noses and voting for their candidate. If the Republicans had come up with a less controversial candidate I believe they could have won handily over Hillary, Obama was bad enough , Hillary is more of the same and even worse with more baggage."
983636,aplumma,2016-10-16 13:36:00,6896,With the information that is twisted by US news media and the spin second hand information that you have available you realize that this thread is doomed before it is even started. I (not being Canadian) have yet to comment on a Canadian political thread because of this fact. The other reason is no matter what my opinion or fact filled thoughts are I have no say in the outcome of Canadian politics much as you have no say in the outcome of the US political system. Keep the discussion fact filled and the first rock thrown at the US political system I will lock it. The owners have discussed the political thread guidelines and we do not feel this board needs to go in this direction it always goes wrong.  Art

983638,Locnar,2016-10-16 13:55:00,645,"I couldn't imagine being a yank and having to decide between the two. In my opinion, it's 6 of one and half a dozen of the other. In one aspect of trump's behaviour, it makes him seem at least human as opposed to the usual robotic presidents and candidates. And for the Americans who want to see the government change, unfortunately for them, the only option is the Trump. Clinton will continue to run the country in the same corrupt manner. The change Trump would bring is very questionable as to how beneficial it would be to the country and its peoples.  Now, I'm going to take a very bold step here... I think I would rather see the Trump in office than Clinton... Just to see what will happen, what portion of his plans will be enacted. And all in all, Trump is pro 2nd amendment, so therefor... if he winds up being tyrannical or just insane, they have the right to overthrow him... and perhaps reshape their hilarious joke that is their ""democratic"" system."

There hasn't been a single word in any news media that the military have raised their alert status to DEFCON 3 from DEFCON 5.

983659,DRIFTER_016,2016-10-16 17:12:00,10439,"Your link doesnt work for me  Don't know why.      This is the DEFCON Warning System. Alert status for 8 P.M., Thursday, October 13th, 2016. Condition code is Yellow. DEFCON 3.  Tensions between Russia and the United States have reached levels beyond the cold war in the recent week.  The situation between Russia and the United States is extremely fluid at the moment. In all likelihood as dynamic as at times during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. Mainstream media has taken a very serious tone concerning the change from diplomatic to military options between NATO and Russia. CNN stated, â€œIt's not a new Cold War. It's not even a deep chill. It's an outright conflict.â€ On October 10th Former Soviet Premier Gorbachev is quoted as saying, â€œI think the world has reached a dangerous point.â€â€¨â€¨There are signs of a potential growing large scale conflict in nearly every geopolitical hotspot including Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, and the Philippines. Syria is seen as one of the trigger points to the renewed tensions between the United States and Russia. The United States has also accused Russia of a cyberattack and meddling with the US Presidential Election. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest promised on Tuesday that the U.S. would deliver a â€œproportionalâ€ response to Russiaâ€™s alleged hacking of American computer systems. The US and Britain are also expected to weigh into Syrian military options on Friday. This could increase tensions between the two superpowers to a greater extent.  Moreover, Houthi rebels on the South Coast of Yemen fired one anti-ship missile at the U.S.S. Mason on Sunday, and another on Wednesday. The Pentagon responded by firing 5 TLAM missiles at radar stations inside Yemen. Around this same time, Iran dispatched a fleet of ships to the area. The U.S.S. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group has also been dispatched to the area.  At this time, the DEFCON Warning System feels that an increase to DEFCON 3 would be a prudent move. The situation is currently fluid with diplomatic ties strained and military threats coming from both sides. Russian media is reportedly telling its citizens to prepare for nuclear war. Russia has recently conducted civil defense drills and completed inspections of underground areas to house government officials and some civilians in the event of nuclear war. This is a very sensitive situation which has the potential to spiral out of control. It is recommended that all citizens learn the steps to be taken in the event of nuclear war. We will continue to bring updated information as we receive it.  The DEFCON Warning System is an analytical reporting organization which focuses on nuclear threats against the United States and offers an alert code to the public based on current events. It is not affiliated with any government agency and does not represent the alert status of any military branch. The public should make their own evaluations and not rely on the DEFCON Warning System for any strategic planning. At all times, citizens are urged to learn what steps to take in the event of a nuclear attack.  If this had been an actual attack, the DEFCON Warning System will give radiation readings for areas that are reported to it. Your readings will vary. Official news sources will have radiation readings for your area.  For immediate updates, go to http://www.defconwarningsystem.com. Breaking news and important information can be found on the DEFCON Warning System message board and on the DEFCON Twitter feed DEFCONWS. You may also subscribe to the YouTube channel DefconWarningSystem and the DEFCON Warning System mailing list. Note that Twitter and YouTube updates may be subject to delays. The next scheduled update is 6 P.M. Pacific Time, October 20th, 2016. Additional updates will be made as the situation warrants, with more frequent updates at higher alert levels.  This concludes this broadcast of the DEFCON Warning System."

983674,Canadave,2016-10-16 19:10:00,62,"I haven't been here for a few years but if you remember me you know I love to rant and with informed opinions.  I research the financial and political scene for at least 3 hours per day.  I first became intrigued about Obama when he made his keynote speech at a Democrat convention while still a State senator.  I was shocked to see his audience of clapping seals screaming their approval as if it was at an Elvis concert but his speech was nothing less than a long list of meaningless cliches, slogans and buzzwords.  It would have made a good Saturday Night Live skit ridiculing politicians.  I was so intrigued that I have since purchased over 20 books on him.  Likewise, I have 6 books on the Clintons.  There are only two things you need to know about Hilary. Number one, withing 2 days of Slick Willy's first election she actually stated ...""WEEEEE are the President"". That must be the first time in history that the spouse of an elected national leader is automatically included as a co-winner.  Not being a shrink I'm not sure if that means she's a narcissist, a sociopath or a psychopath. I have read opinions of psychiatrists who conclude that she is at least one of the first two.  Don't take my word on it, just do your own homework.  Also, do your homework on ""Chinagate"".  In a nutshell, The Clintons after receiving a huge contribution to their Clinton alleged foundation, immediately loosened the foreign trade rules that allowed the Chinese communists to get secret missile technology that they needed for their ICBMs which enabled them to more accurately target American cities. When an investigation began, suddenly Americans involved took the 5th and Chinese nationals involved immediately fled home to the People's republic to avoid arrest.  Call me silly but I believe that used to be called high treason.  The law pertaining to Hilary's emails is very specific ... United States Code: Title 18. Section 2071:  (a) Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record filed…in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. ( Whoever, having the custody of any such record, unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. Hilary was forced to admit that she deleted tens of thousands of emails the majority of which was government correspondence and we now know included top secret information.  TheDemocrat government is so corrupt that even the head of the FBI said she should not be prosecuted because they didn't know her intent.  The obvious escapes him.  Anybody else would be in prison by now.  At a very minimum, that law says that she could never hold ANY government office let alone the Presidency.  I'll spare you the long list of Clinton crimes and incompetencies.  Her admission to her deleting emails is all you need to exclude her from office. Trump is the last of the Republican candidates that I would have chosen but he is the only one who has addressed the issue that has most concerned me going back literally decades and that's the huge trade deficit that is killing the country.  It's now at 700 BILLION annually.  The U.S. now has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. No wonder companies have fled the country in droves and continue to do so .  At least Trump understands business while Hilary is a die hard redistributionist.  Her track record is one of endless failures.  When the country is at stake who cares about Trump's alleged womanizing.  Those accusations are now falling apart.  Compared to the rapes and assaults of sex-obsessed Bill Clinton and Hilary's defence of him while bad mouthing his victims all the while claiming to be a supporter of women.  The decision becomes obvious.  Sometimes you just have to hold your nose and vote and not worry about the predictable accusations of the left of predicting the world will fall apart and there will be a nuclear war next week if Trump is elected.  Prince Justin is another rant.  "
