982800,Locnar,2016-10-04 02:48:00,645,"Hey, just wondering if anyone has driven the Spruce Lake Trail up near Bancroft. Was thinking about heading up that way, wondering if it's like a 4x4 trail or car accessible. Looks like a beautiful area to wet a line."
982970,Chuck Enwinde,2016-10-06 03:59:00,247,I'd say its somewhere in between 4x4 and car accessible.  I haven't been down it yet this year but I would think anything with a bit of ground clearance would be ok.
983152,Locnar,2016-10-09 23:30:00,645,"thanks man, that's good to know. You haven't been down it this year, so I take it you've driven it in the past? Is it like a gravel road?"

983201,Chuck Enwinde,2016-10-11 07:48:00,247,"Yes, I've driven down it a few times - but in a truck.  It wasn't bad but I couldn't say for certain if a car would make it unscathed. Next time I'm down it (probably a couple weeks) I'll pay a little closer attention and let you know."
983557,jayess,2016-10-15 14:50:00,187,"Gravel road, easy traveling. Some of the roads in the area are dicey, just use your best judgement when you get to each. In particular, Swordfingal Lake Trail has some areas that would make one turn back, but my brother has driven it in a Cobalt. V Lake trail has some dicey sections, but it is walkable if you need to halt your travels.  You can get to Mayo Lake through Crooked Trail off of Spruce Lake Trail. Cool little gravel pit on the way in.  Also, consider Mephisto Lake Landing.  Check your regs, too. I can't remember which lakes are stocked or not, but should be ample opportunities around there."
983575,Locnar,2016-10-15 20:29:00,645,"Much appreciated Jayess! We'll be headed up for the last weekend of October. I got a couple stocked lakes picked out, hopefully we can figure out the fish at this time of year."
983692,Locnar,2016-10-16 23:00:00,645,"I've never tried fishing for rainbows or any other trout in the fall... Any starter's advice? Lures, bait... classic fall habitat? ... I've been trying to research online, but all of the trout fishing tips I can find are about steelies or lakers."
983738,Sinker,2016-10-17 14:57:00,8692,"Shallow. Worm and a bobber usually works LOL....seriously. The later in the fall the better. They are fun to catch, and easy to get from shore in the late fall.  S."
983783,Locnar,2016-10-17 22:27:00,645,"Worm and bobber in the shallows eh? Like, against shore kinda shallow? Or like 5-10ft kinda shallow? Will they still go for a spinner or small spoon? Minnows? We'll hopefully have about 2 days of fishing, since we are camping at the lake for the night."
983831,BillM,2016-10-18 14:29:00,17367,Read the regs if you plan on bringing minnows.
983966,jayess,2016-10-20 17:34:00,187,"I'd go for a spinner tipped with a worm, myself. Bluefox vibrax in blue is a go-to speck and rainbow spinner for me."
