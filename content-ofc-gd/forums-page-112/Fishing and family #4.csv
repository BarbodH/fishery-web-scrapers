Im a little peeved at her as she decided to kill 2 skunks the other night and it wreaks to high hell in the yard right now.  The other was our boxer. Awesome dog! She passed 4 years ago after being poisoned with anti freeze. Never found out who did it though, and that might be a good thing because id probably be in a cell right now"
