Port hope is a 90 min drive for me so if someone can give me a heads up whether the fish are still there or whether it has slowed down, I would appreciate it.  I am interested in chucking spoons off the pier at the mouth of the Ganny.  Please PM me.  Thanks"

983348,fishermccann,2016-10-13 14:04:00,655,"You pass over many creeks and rivers that hold salmon between Oakville and Port Hope,( Highland, Duffins, Bowmanville, Willmot, etc.) you do not have to drive the full 90 minutes."
983429,huzzsaba,2016-10-14 13:54:00,884,"Thanks for the replies. I will give the places in between a shot if I cannot make it to Port Hope. I was at Port hope 3 weeks ago and did well. Went 2/3. Both over 20 lbs. But as we all know salmon fishing is addictive and you can never get enough of it ?  Tried Bronte last night for a few hours but nothing. Seen a few jumpers, but no bites."
