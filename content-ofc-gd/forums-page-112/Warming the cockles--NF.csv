983962,ketchenany,2016-10-20 16:47:00,3229,There was a story on Global a few weeks back and the majority of farms have stopped doing the self-serve They opend a locked box and found a few dimes!! I guess there was someone else there so they put some change in
983972,DanD,2016-10-20 18:25:00,2223,"Down around Turkey Point (Simcoe/Delhi area) there are still quite a few self-serve vegetable stands. Usually fresh, good quality stuff and inexpensive. We'll normally round up our purchase to the next folding denomination. Like if it was 13 bucks, we'd throw in 15.  Dan."
983982,misfish,2016-10-20 22:24:00,29133,"Theres a few around here as well. One stand is for pumkins. It does make one think, there is still good out there and trust.  Theres even a guy that has a small stand in the fall with bags of golf balls. Ya it,s only his time to walk and find stray off the course balls, but atleast he trust those that are honest."
983984,porkpie,2016-10-20 23:00:00,2521,Mainly self serve around here.  If your far enough from a city your probably still able to do it!
983988,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-20 23:10:00,8243,"Many out here in Haldimand Norfolk. Gary on the Town Line has a fridge full of farm fresh eggs, 3 bucks a dozen or $4.00 for 18. And some are so big the carton won't close. Some still have some feathers on the shells. Eat one of these and you will never buy those 3 week old eggs from the grocery stores again. Fresh vegs the closer you get to Simcoe."

We always grab corn from the little wagon across from the school in Ida on our way past to the cottage on friday nights. Fair price and the corn is always good.  And we always round up our money in their favour.  It will be a sad day if we ever drive by and the little wagon is gone."

984547,HTHM,2016-10-26 02:07:00,4082,"He didn't want to type Ã¶f my heart"", can't blame him that is a lot of keystrokes."
984549,GBW,2016-10-26 02:25:00,8460,"I love it when the farmers are selling fresh food out front the Macs on Angeline in Lindsay.  I can get 6 corn for $4 (good deal or not I don't care) and if that is all I'm getting that day I always hand the person the $5 and say ""it's fine, you deserve to get paid for great food and service"" cause I will not take the $1 change when they try and force the $1 back on me.  They worked WAY harder than I did for that..."
984553,manitoubass2,2016-10-26 03:15:00,11391,We have mennonites that farm  They drop off fresh produce to every indiginous family in the area lol.  I guess were all poor? But ill gladly take it for all those christmas carrols they sing on our deck???
984554,GBW,2016-10-26 03:23:00,8460,But ill gladly take it for all those christmas carrols they sing on our deck Bust out the electric guitar and drums this year and join them when they show up is what I'd do as a thanks.  Cause it would be one heck of a thankful memory for them in return!
984555,manitoubass2,2016-10-26 03:25:00,11391," Which is hilarious because they started coming to our annual fish fry at the powwow grounds  So there ya have it, walleye trumps religion???  Im not joking. They are literally scared of the drums"
