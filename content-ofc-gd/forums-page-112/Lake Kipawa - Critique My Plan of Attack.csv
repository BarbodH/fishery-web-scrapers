983950,chris.brock,2016-10-20 13:15:00,4053," I don't doubt you know what you're doing and that you catch plenty of fall eyes up there Akrisoner. It's the same scenario around the dams in the Kawarthas. The eyes enter rivers and come up to the dams in the fall too. Their motivation is feeding though, not spawning."
983951,OhioFisherman,2016-10-20 13:39:00,6623,"The fall feed, they are looking for food and wander."

983956,Sinker,2016-10-20 15:07:00,8692,"Let me expalain it for you a little better so maybe you will understand. It may help you will fall walleyes.  If the fall, the water temps drop. When the surface water gets colder than the water at the bottom of the lake, (water is densest at 4 degrees celsius), the lakes turn over. The surface water sinks to the bottom, and the bottom water comes to the top, hence the term ""turnover"". Usually when a lake first turns over, fish are kinda scattered, and can really be anywhere. During the day the sun shines, and warms up the shallows, where baitfish congregate. The walleyes, (and most other fish too) find the warm water, and bait, and get their feed bag on. The warmest water is close to shore, shallow bays etc....where walleye may spawn in the spring as well. A shallow muddy bay with the wind blowing into it is always a great spot....you get the idea.  Same thing happens in the spring. Ice comes off, water is cold, the shallows warm first, fish move in....etc.  I hope that helps a little.  I understand you are fishing the same spots you would in spring, but spawning has nothing to do with it.  S."
983960,AKRISONER,2016-10-20 15:38:00,5558,"funny enough, im not fishing shallow...but im not fishing deep...we are on fish that are migrating into a larger basin where they seem to live their lives over the winter and eventually spawn.  Being on Gbay, they definitely move off of the big lake at this time of year...progressively the bigger ones move in the closer and closer we get to the spawn...hence the size consistency is incredible once february hits."
983964,Sterling,2016-10-20 16:58:00,477,"AKRISONER vs Mister G fishing face-off?  So we returned yesterday from our trip and man, was the fishing ever tough. We managed a dozen walleye throughout the trip. Weather didn't help at all. We didn't fish Wednesday and couldn't get out for prime time on Tuesday. Weather forecast was messed up - calling for 3km/hr winds when really it was 20+ all day.  I'm putting all details of the trip here so that others may learn from it.  Trip dates October 14-19th.  I used my trusty temperature probe to check layer profiles. In most areas the profile went like this;  0ft - 55.2 (sheltered areas - 57) 5ft - 54.9 10ft - 54.9 15ft - 54.9 20ft - 54.9 25ft - 54.5 30ft - 50.0 35ft - 48.3 40ft - 47.5 45ft - 46.8 50ft - 46.6 55ft - 46.4 60ft - 46.2  So there's a pretty clear thermocline at the 30ft mark. I think it's definitely possible that turnover has started in some area. On a couple occasions my depth finder was showing the thermocline and it was fluctuating in depth, usually between 20-40ft. In some areas (usually mid-lake) it curved all the way to surface, I'm kicking myself for not snapshotting this, but it was pretty cool.  For fun I took some time to make note of lake trout behavior, they were stuck at 30ft and bottom. Rarely in between.  In terms of spots, as I quickly learned, the south-central arm holds very few fish. I don't really have an explanation for this - maybe it's just too far from spawning areas? We did catch a bunch of fish here but they were dinks. Either way, if you're on this lake, try to launch in the South-East arm and fish there (for walleye, anyway).  All fish were caught in 20-30 FoW. We tried REALLY hard to fish shallow, deep, etc. Nothing yielded fish but jigging. I was using a plain drop-shot setup and the wife was usually bouncing a jig off bottom. Fishing mid-day was a waste of time. Evening bite or bust!  Best spots were ""2"" and the north side of the big island to the left of ""3"". And by ""best"" I mean least crappy.  We did hit some spots that members here PM'ed me - I won't share them obviously, but consider that they're not in the South-Central arm.  Unfortunately it's impossible to find leeches at this time of year, at least in the Temiscaming area. If you need bait, grab it in North Bay before heading out. I was able to snag 3 dozen worms from Pro Nature which cleaned them right out.  Somewhat related - Navionics has this lake charted almost perfectly. I set my depth to -2ft (the lake was recently drained) and the depth shown on Navionics almost always matched what the depth finder showed. It was even more accurate than the maps provided at the cottage."
983967,AKRISONER,2016-10-20 17:45:00,5558,"at least you found a few fish...you are a bit further north than where I typically fish, but if i was fishing id be in 15-20 on the drop shot as well. Glad you at least got a few."
983974,Joeytier,2016-10-20 19:40:00,3990,"The area where you were staying, what you call the south central arm I assume, is an excellent area in spring and summer, for walleye and lake trout both."
983372,Sterling,2016-10-13 20:24:00,477,"So in my last thread I asked for some advice as to where I should take the wife for a 1 week fishing getaway. Kipawa really stood out, and I'm locked in for the 14th-20th.  We haven't had the opportunity to fish walleye at all this spring/summer/fall, so I really need to put her on some.  A quick study of the lake shows that Kipawa is branchy, deep and big. I'm staying in a bay near the public boat launch on the southern end of the lake (circled in red).    This time of year I imagine fish will still be in 30-40 FOW. Some have mentioned a potential lake turnover, so the first thing I'll do is verify that the thermocline is there. I have a temperature probe that will do this for me. Honestly I'm not too concerned about a turnover, I think this will happen in November.  The areas marked on the map are either large bowls in the 30-40 FOW range, or sunken islands I plan on hitting in the evening/mornings. Here are some screenies of the areas, in an imgur album.  I plan on trying the following, in order; Does this seem like a reasonable plan? Should I switch up the order? I don't know the lake at all. Been there as a kid a couple times but that's it. If anyone could add some tips I'd greatly appreciate it!"
983375,floater,2016-10-13 20:32:00,220,I was there in August for three days. Launched and stayed at a campground right in the town of Kipawa. I got nothing the first two days but on the third I got 9 nice pickerel in three hours. Drifting with the wind along the side of an island in 30 fow. Green propeller jig with a worm did the trick. Your areas all look promising though. I tried the worm harness for awhile but it was too windy and I kept losing contact with the bottom. Good luck
983382,duke01,2016-10-13 21:59:00,20,It is a huge system to fish. It was probably 10 years ago that i was there and it was tough fishing. Watch out because the lake gets rough fast and the shoals are very random. I think your approach sounds good and you should bring all your tricks to that lake.
983384,JoshS,2016-10-13 22:09:00,729,Can't help you with Kipawa but I like the thread... critiquing the plan of attack!  The target daytime depth seems to make sense. Can't go wrong fishing mid lake humps with live bait and I wouldn't fish slow anywhere with a blank screen (that's a given). I bet you could find the larger fish at night up relatively shallow.
983400,OhioFisherman,2016-10-14 00:41:00,6623,"My dad was there once, like 50 years ago and in the spring. Not sure I would focus on 30-40 feet of water, it's October and the water is cooling, I would probably start a lot shallower 6-10 feet."
983401,T-Bone,2016-10-14 01:20:00,160,Been there last 17 years in late July and always get fish. Some years silly good...others just ok. If you're staying down around the town of Kipawa good luck. Don't hear of great success down there ever. We jig fish 99% of the time and I don't believe I see that in your plan. Different time though. Beautiful lake...very expansive...thousands of spots...but which one is on is the game.Took us about 6-7 years to dial it in. Good luck.
983406,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-14 01:47:00,8243,"As Ohio Fisherman start shallower and work deeper.   With all that structure I would be stumped as to where to start. A few cold beers, some Hi Test and snacks offered to locals and others that have been there before can be better than the most expensive electronics.  I like your approach. A job without a plan is a plan for disaster.  Go get em. And you two stay safe. If the catching is poor the Fall colours will be fantastic. Enjoy."
983413,smitty55,2016-10-14 02:31:00,928,"Probably too late now but good luck on your trip. If the lodge has a main dock with lights on don't discount some shore night fishing. Don't forget the lawn chairs and beer/wine.   I won best Pickerel of the trip off the dock at Alwaki one year on our last night lol. Twister tail with a salted Emerald if I recall hehe.  Cast, slip float, jig or drop shot are all good options.  Have fun.  Cheers"
983420,Joeytier,2016-10-14 09:48:00,3990,"Just got off Kipawa yesterday, was moose hunting and not fishing, though.  Lake was about 57 degrees and will be more like 54-55 now.  Don't be surprised if you have a hard time finding fish.  I would start shallow with fairly aggressive presentations first.  Last week they were definitely shallow and feeding up.  Also, the lake is down at least 3 feet from summer levels now, so there will be hazards that aren't marked all over the lake.  You'll be in the back of Jawbone's bay which is a pretty spot, work with a few people that live down there."
983748,Sterling,2016-10-17 17:13:00,477,"Update guys, water is still 57, not muchluck though.  I posted a thread on the kipawa forums, here's a copy of it in case anyone has pointers :  Hi all,  I'm currently camping on the southern arm of kipawa and not having much success.  From what I read it seems the southeast arm of the lake is probably a better area? Anyone know of a place to launch?  I've tried pretty much everything in the south end without much success (only 4 so far), including down rigging at 30, harnesses,  jigging, etc. Only action was at sundown. Is there something else I should try?  Any tips are appreciated!"
983758,OhioFisherman,2016-10-17 19:03:00,6623,"57 is easily within their comfort range, find baitfish? feeding areas? A jig and twister tail? tip it with a piece of crawler or gulp? Swim it slow, cover water?"
983771,sauce,2016-10-17 20:43:00,219,"I fished there years ago. We stayed near Hunters narrows at white birch point camp. We never had much luck fishing for walleyes during daytime. Sundown was when we would get into them. The few walleyes we did catch during the day were caught downrigging for Lakers. 25 to 30 feet down on 3"" spoons. Back then our walleye fishing was heavily reliant on live bait. Worms and leeches. We would typically anchor and jig next to the boat. Lots of known sunset hotspots. I'm sure you have noticed boats stacking up late in the day.  We did find a few spots of our own back in coves. But always seemed to do better when we joined the masses in the community holes."
983776,Old Ironmaker,2016-10-17 21:19:00,8243,"We never even bothered fishing for Eyes during the day when we had our annual spring and fall trips. Early supper and on the water by 6PM. Day was spent fishing for Pike, golfing, hunting for wild garlic was fun or going to the Ballet in the afternoon. Just because we were a gang of Steelworkers didn't mean we weren't cultured."
983828,AKRISONER,2016-10-18 13:19:00,5558,if im hunting eyes right now...im finding where they spawn and im dead sticking minnows in their doorway. Id be looking for somewhere the water is flowing into the lake and hitting them where they stage in 12-20 FOW.
983834,Sinker,2016-10-18 15:43:00,8692,You know the spawn in the spring right? lol

983947,Mister G,2016-10-20 11:22:00,1429,"they're foraging, I don't think ""staging"" is the right word Bingo..........fall fishing has NOTHING to do with fish staging for spawning in 6 months. The walleyes will do different things in different lake all depending on forage of that particular lake in question. Most times after turn over walleyes will be found in deep drop offs feeding on forage which could be miles away from where they will eventually spawn. However, prior to a turn over in early fall, many walleyes are working shallow areas at night frogging."
