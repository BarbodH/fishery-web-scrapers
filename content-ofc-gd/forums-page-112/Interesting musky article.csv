I fish for mainly Catfish and Bass and those are the key ingredients to locating apex predators. The push for apex feeders to move usually is food and if the area supports schooling fish then a move to the winter ball ups would be a reason to go deeper. The Large blue catfish and the channel cats move to deep water in the fall/winter cycle and will move long distances to get to wintering holes.These areas are critical that C and R are practiced or you can deplete the area of future trophy spawners quickly. The good news is the water temperature slows the bite way down and most times you have to hit them on the nose to get a response.   art"
