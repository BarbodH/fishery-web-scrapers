638523,manitoubass2,2011-11-08 20:05:00,11391,"  I've had one nest on a stretch of shore where I shore fish all the time. He made two nice boroughs in the shoreline.  The first time we met, I was chasing pike along the shoreline, and I kept hearing surface water breaks. I had assumed it was a pike feeding, so I was following the shoreline taking cast, hoping to meet up with him. Took a good 5-10 minutes for me to actually see him, D'OH, it's a fisher! lol.  He;s been around for quite some time now, and he doesn't seemed bothered by me at all. He comes close (about 10-15ft), but no closer. And he appears to like making me think hes a fish? lol.      "
638526,Harrison,2011-11-08 20:10:00,2202,"I've had my fair share of run ins in my time with mean territorial fishers that think they own the land and water, however these ones were in waders.  Seriously had either a fisher or marten freak on me one time while Moose hunting, vicious little thing. Actually prepared for it to attack me, then for some reason it turned and ran."
638206,OhioFisherman,2011-11-07 22:54:00,6623,"I have no idea why people don`t expect to find "" wildlife "" in the woods."
638235,Jer,2011-11-07 23:32:00,1426,"We've had a mink at our house off and on for years. This summer he got in a little tussle with our dog at the door of the boathouse, what a vicious little bugger. Moosy tossed it in the air a few times and it took off. Both our cats had front row seats and didn't move a muscle.  He must still be around, just the other day my minnow bucket got cleaned out hanging from the dock."
638238,BillM,2011-11-07 23:36:00,17367," If he's not on your property, I don't think there is anything you can do.  And to be honest, you moved to the country, what did you expect?  Don't leave the dog out unattended or it will be dinner."
638253,NAW,2011-11-08 00:07:00,4022,"Thanks!   I reached down to clip on my release, and the when I looked up it was 20 yards closer.  That made me start to think a little faster!  I've been an outdoorsman my entire life in this area of Ontario, and have never seen a fisher.  I'm sure that we can co-inside with this fisher with out any problems.  My yard is fenced in, so my dog wont be able to wander far.  Don't get me wrong guys.  I moved to the country fully expecting to see all sorts of wildlife.  That's actually one of the reasons I moved to the country (or a tleast a change in the ""Wildlife"" I'm used to seeing in Barrie).  I don't want you guys to think I'm some little nancy boy who's afraid to go in the woods because of the big bad fisher....  Just looking for some advice, or past experience you've had.  The last thing I need after spending all of my savings on a new  house, it a $2000 vet bill.."

638258,adolson,2011-11-08 00:09:00,783,"Yeah, something like that guy, but it was only on the shore when I was there. I see that huge stickerel in your shot too, I believe I caught that one a couple times. Might be a different one, since that lake is stacked with them and not much else.  If you don't think that's a fisher, what do you think it is? I looked up martens and fishers and weasels and whatever else I could find, and the one I saw looked most like a fisher."

638272,Rod Caster,2011-11-08 00:24:00,5784, A mink I think.
638275,NAW,2011-11-08 00:27:00,4022," Haha.  Nope.  Good find though.  I'm thinking, if it becomes a problem, I will take Randy's advice.  Live trap, and re-locate to my bosses back yard.."
638278,John Bacon,2011-11-08 00:29:00,3277," Can be sure without a size reference; but I say it is most likely a mink. Weasles, mink, marten, otter, and fisher all have the same shape. But they are different sizes. If it's in the water it is mostly either a mink or otter."
638294,Miracon,2011-11-08 00:48:00,200, Nick...thanks to this forum...I learned a lot about trapping rodents! And my friend almost did relocate the raccoon to her bosses backyard! But she chose a Gold Club instead!

638323,ChrisK,2011-11-08 02:09:00,2772,We got one that lives in the river bank in a tree stump root were we fish. I've gone over to retrieve floats off the bank by the stump a few times and heard it growling at me from inside the stump. Needless to say I don't spend a lot of time near that old stump. This guy is a big full grown fisher and more than likely has a family in there as well.
638379,adolson,2011-11-08 06:26:00,783,"Hmm, well the one in your pic looks small enough. The one I saw looked too big (to me) to be a mink, but maybe it was.. I was pretty sure at the time, but I didn't get any pics or anything."
638407,NAW,2011-11-08 13:13:00,4022,"The one I saw from nose to tail was about 3.5 feet long.  Where's Luc G when you need him!  I'm sure he would know exactly how to tell the difference for you guys.  I'm 99% sure what I saw was a fisher.  I'm going in the bush tomorrow morning, I'll try to grab a picture."
638410,cynmar,2011-11-08 13:26:00,169,"Mink definitely, unless I'm wrong the Pine Marten is mostly a land animal . I always thought fisher and Marten were both the same creature.  Bill"
638423,NAW,2011-11-08 14:31:00,4022,"I just got my call returned by the MNR.  We discussed a few options.  Option #1 - Have a trapper come in and make some money from the pelt (around $80).  Option #2 - Live Trap.  Which will not likely work, as there is a law stating that you can not move an animal more the 1km in a live trap.  He explained the reasons for this, I can elaborate if anyone wants to know why.  Option #3 - Leave the fisher as is, and just don't let my dog out un-attended in low light times of the day.  Which for us Canadians is all the time in the winter..  He went on to say that Fishers are incredible little mammals, and that they are not aggressive toward humans unless cornered.  He believes that all of the negative thoughts about them is based on fear, and that they're not as bad and people make them out to be.  He thinks the fisher was not charging me, rather then just running around in the woods, and didn't notice me because of my camo.  (I don't believe that though, I was up and moving around)  He did confirm my concerns about my small dog, and the a low potential for an attack.  I have a friend who is a trapper (new to the business), but he doesn't have a quota for Fishers.  The MNR guy did say that if I get my trapper buddy in contact with him, that he would give him a licence to possess and sell 1 Fisher pelt.  This would allow him to come help me trap the Fisher.    Thanks to everyone for the replies to this thread.  I appreciate all for your input.  I think I will let this one play out.  If I move in, and never see the Fisher near my dog, or causing damage to my property, I will let it be.  But if it starts to get aggressive toward my dog, then I might take some further steps to remove it from the property."
638450,Abraxus,2011-11-08 16:01:00,104," Wolverines are the largest member of the weasel family. Essentially the fisher is a very close cousin, just more aquatic in nature. lol"
638458,cram,2011-11-08 16:11:00,1733,"I'd personally love to have one near my place.  They are very, very cool animals.  Also WAY less of a threat to your dog than say, a group of coyotes (depending on where you live).  If a bald eagle nests in your backyard are you going to take it down as well?  They like to eat little doggies too. :-)"
638461,NAW,2011-11-08 16:16:00,4022," I would discourage a blad eagle to nest in my back yard, but we all know that's a bad example, as it would be a 1 in a million chance of that happening in my area (I get your humor though).  And coyotes are open season for me to shoot, unlike Fisher, which are illigal for me to shoot."
638462,BillM,2011-11-08 16:18:00,17367,Great way to stop the local cats from crapping in your gardens  :)  Built in home security!

638033,NAW,2011-11-07 14:10:00,4022,"So I bought a nice place in the country.  Pretty much my dream home.  It's only 1.5 acres, but I have hunting rights to the 150 acre property next to me.  On Sat,  I went in to the bush for the first time to do a little scouting, and hang a tree stand for the shotgun season.  Went in early on Sunday to see if I could get an idea of the deer patterns in that area.  But  instead of seeing deer, I saw a big old fisher.  I tried to go have a closer look at it, and the dam thing charged me.  Didn't stop untill I drew my bow..  This crazy little animal had no fear of me.  It was way to fast to get a shot off.  Which is a good thing, because I later found out, that you are not allowed to hunt them, unless you are a trapper.  Have any of you guys/gals had issues with Fishers before, and if so what did you do about it?  I have an 11lb fu-fu dog.  Easy dinner for a fisher."
638038,lew,2011-11-07 14:26:00,12766,I've seen them in the woods out behind my place too and did a bit of reading on them. Sounds like they can be a pretty nasty critter  and one article I read said their one of the few animals that'll kill a porcupine.
638043,NAW,2011-11-07 14:35:00,4022,"I've done a little reading too.  Nearly extinct back in the day.  Re-introduced, maybe by MNR, maybe to control porcupine..  Roomers?  But one thing for sure, I've been told by several people, that pound for pound they are one of the most aggressive, dangerous animals out there.  No threat to an adult, but for cats and dogs for sure.  Even fawn deer have been killed.  One attacked a 6 year old boy, and chewed his leg up pretty good."
638048,lew,2011-11-07 14:44:00,12766,I walk my little pooch in the woods everyday and he's always sniffing everything and every once in awhile he'll sniff something he doesn't like and run for home. Don't know if it's a bear or a fisher but he never hangs around to find out.

638102,jimmer,2011-11-07 16:31:00,2730,Keep your distance from those buggers. I have seen them skinned out and they have quite the muscle build up around their jaws. Yes. they are one of the few that can flip a porcupine over and kill it.

So I threw the walleye in our minnow tank to gut in the morning... Woke up... All gone... 5 walleye up to 4 lbs all gone... Tiny footprints all over the minnow tank... We later caught one in the act  of steeling minnows from the same tank...  Hard to believe a tiny mink could wrestle a healthy 4lb walleye out os a big tank full of water...

I was sitting a deer watch one time and had a fisher come out to me. He sat on a log about 15 feet away from me and chattered at me for about 5 minutes. Wasn't nasty but I didn't give him reason to be. I didn't make any sudden moves but my gun was ready in case he did. When I had a farm, there was a marten caused me some problems with my chickens for a while. I fixed that pretty quick."

Deer , bear , moose , and birds ,lots of fishing 5 or 6 lakes within walking distance for lakers , brookies ,eyes ,smallys,perch and  even a little bit of rabbit's when things are slow .We had two or three of these varmits raiding the camp . bring home a stringer of eyes leave them out on the cutting board for breakfest , wake up to one or two full fish and two three heads ??? hang a deer and some thing chewed on the legs ,whole rabbits taken off the line , WHAT IS UP , When we went after these guys , we figgered these would be easy to kill as they have no fear of man ,run right up to you hissing and barking like an out of control lap dog. but after checking out if we could kill these buggers , it was NO GO ,mnr guy comes by at least once a month to our camp , as he knows we are good and wants to know what we have seen and how we are doing , allways help out these guys as we have nothing to hide and because at least one or two of us are in the bush most hunting days we can tell them whats going on .So to deal with this problem we changed up to paint ball guns   , tho fast movers  there were still lots of purple and red martins/fishers for a few weeks around the camp , and  we found  after a hit or two they moved on to better areas.But we still have many vids  from the trail cams of (and my Boyys run on the extra large size, funny to see a 2 hundred pound guy running for his life from a 3 /4 pound  varmit) , running back from the out house with a Wiesell on their tail.
