I've been to the Kag out of Nakina. Great lodge, great food and great fishing.  http://www.leuenberger.ca/kag.htm   Also out of Nakina with great lodging and food is Esnagami:  http://www.esnagami.com/  Mar Mac out of White River is good:  http://www.northtoadventure.com/view.php?lodge=l_marmac&page=lmm_home  Timberwolf Lodge out of Hornepayne is good: http://www.timberwolflodge.net/fishing.html  Granite Hill Lodge also out of Hornepayne is good:  http://www.pkresort.com/index.html   Any of these lodges would provide a fantastic experience. I can recommend plenty of amazing housekeeping camps as well. If you don't mind doing your own cooking the prices are a lot more reasonable."

There are a couple of lodges on Kabinakagami that might be worth checking out as well [Pine Portage, Watsons Kaby Lodge.   The lodge I stayed at was nice, but the food wasn't all that great.  The two I listed might be better .   When I was researching my trip for the year I went to  Kaby, the lodges on Ara, Meta and Brace Lakes (just NW of Abamasagi) were also recommended to me.  Would still like to visit them as well.  About 6 hours North of Toronto there are three boat-to American Plan lodges [Island 10, Garden Island, Red Pine Lodge] on Lady Evelyn Lake that offer the remote feel with good walleye fishing.   However, they aren't really much cheaper than a fly-to American Plan lodge in the more remote areas on Ontario.  Just a good option for those who don't want to drive 12+ hours.  Anyway, if I were you and could afford it, Leuenbergers Kag Lake would be my first choice [been on my to visit list for a while now].  Good luck with your search!! It's not easy!"
