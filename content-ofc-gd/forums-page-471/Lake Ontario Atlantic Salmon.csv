I look forward to the day of being able to say ""See I told you so, I knew the Bring back the Salmon project would work"". Regardless, this is still a win win situation for ALL cold water fisheries. The scientific information collected, the stream rehabilitation, and the many partnerships created to fund this project, just to name a few.  I always said, you only get back what you you put into it. Not saying everyone who is against this but I bet a generous number of the nah sayers have never contributed as much as an hour towards the fisheries."

638608,John Bacon,2011-11-09 00:52:00,3277," If there is success with the programs then I would expect to see additional rivers stocked. Atlantics are stocked for the purpose of establishing self sustaining populations; thus they will likley only be stocked in rivers that can support self sustaining populations. If XXXX creek contains suitable habitat for establishing a self sustaining population of atlantics, then it is likley to be a future stocking site for atlantics.  Any stream could potentially benefit from rehabilitation projects. Streams that are designated for stocking are probably more likely to be selected for rehabilitation projects; but a lot it is going to depend on whether there is someone willing to lobby projects, so any waterway could end up with projects if the right people back them."
638610,mikeseb,2011-11-09 00:53:00,201,"I never said the stream has spectacular fishing, it doesnt its been a dumping ground for construction companies for the past 3 years.  The only reason I mentioned the name was to see if any stream restoration was taking place.  I figured with guys in the craa in this discussion maybe they would know.  I do apologize though i know naming spots/bodies of water in this forum is a touchy subject."
638615,justin elia,2011-11-09 01:09:00,151," We have done tree plants and dam removals on the river you mentioned; but the Credit River watershed keeps a lot of us very busy for the most part.  There is so much going on that our own time is spread thin and we cannot address issues on other rivers.  We are always looking for groups of guys to mentor who can use government grants to help rivers; Bronte especially, and other tributaries across the North Shore.  Its hard to believe with the amount of pressure Bronte Creek gets, there aren't 3-4 guys in each area willing to help make their home river a great fishery.  A very good friend of mine who fished Bronte for 20+years; well before steelheading was as popular as it is today, would boast about 100 fish days, and good levels of water throughout the fall.  Its a shame that the river has been going downhill for years.  Golf courses having extremely high rights to taking water, development etc.  It is a beautiful river and a piece of wilderness so close to Toronto that is not had by other north shore tributaries.  I have to thank Ron for his kind words.  A lot of people see a thread like this that gives CRAA a bad name.  Its quite the opposite, and Ron is a perfect example of the group of anglers that understand all of our work.  He is probably right though, most anglers would much rather go fishing then spend a few hours giving back."
638620,mikeseb,2011-11-09 01:22:00,201," Thanks thats really all I wanted to know,  if there are any upcoming projects taking place on this river I would be more than willing to volunteer."
638622,craigdritchie,2011-11-09 01:25:00,1586," Not sure I see that anywhere, Justin. You, John and I may disagree on specifics related to the Atlantic salmon program, and that's fair ball, but I don't think anyone can question the years of hard work CRAA and its members have performed for everyone's benefit. CRAA is an organization with a very good name, and deservedly so."
637923,Gregoire,2011-11-07 00:59:00,1397,"I see Wallacio's point here: the regulations are clear. I can only imagine the negative responses someone would get from posting a pic of a 5 pound smallie that was caught in April or May. While I can understand why someone would want to take a photo of an atlantic for the purpose of identifying it if it was caught accidentally, posing with the fish seems a bit much. The analogy of the sturgeon in this case is quite apt. Unless you are doing government sponsored trapping and research there is no reason to be targeting a species if there is no open season. Atlantics are a protected species for a reason. There seems to be only a small amount of fish returning to the tribs every year so an argument could be made that catching any atlantics may severely compromise the population of this fish. Initially I was not sure where Wallacio was going with his posts, but after reading his posts I think he has a valid point. If you know that there is a population of fish that is at risk, why fish in the waters when they are present? If you are that interested in studying the population let the experts collect fish in ways that are less stressful to them and maybe volunteer to help in the data colelction?"
637926,Remastered,2011-11-07 01:07:00,143,I would also agree that encouraging the avoidance of fish like bass just to also avoid the atlantics too isn't very good... Informing more on fish ID seems like a much better option...
637929,danjang,2011-11-07 01:13:00,148, So why not close the river entirely until the Atlantic population become large enough...  The credit does have a warm water fishery. It's one of the things that makes it a great river. Fly fishing and float fishing for bass IMO is a perfectly legit method. Pacific salmon can also enter the river REALLY early. I've caught a chinny as early as mid august.
637948,MCTFisher9120,2011-11-07 02:00:00,3761,I think the project is good. I'm sure the Fleming College Restoration Project has funding from the MNR too but they are not the only people sinking money into the project. Anyway in my first year of school I volunteered some time to help with the release of some fall fingerlings Atlantic's.    Would love to catch a Atlantic...maybe next year
637954,justin elia,2011-11-07 02:36:00,151," I find it hard to agree with you when you are saying it is a black and white issue and your previous post referencing the MNR response to a question CLEARLY states that that it is a grey area and would be up to each individual Conservation Officer to make that decision on the spot depending on how the fish was treated.  That said, I really don't care for your opinion.  Some people would take pictures (many have and sent them to John for verification), and some wouldn't.  Who cares.  Go fishing!"
637966,Frank,2011-11-07 04:02:00,74,"Just thought I would throw this up.  I just caught this Atlantic Salmon yesterday, November 5th in Lake Ontario (St. Catharines)    This fish was released unharmed."
638011,craigdritchie,2011-11-07 12:55:00,1586,"I hate to break it to you, but like so many others, your ""Atlantic salmon"" is a brown trout."
638020,Frank,2011-11-07 13:35:00,74," You could be right, and I too thought it was a trout when I caught it, but when I posted this pic on another forum, everyone said it was a Atlantic Salmon, and after doing some reading, the fish I caught has a slight fork in its caudal fin, in which this fish has so therefore it may be be an Atlantic Salmon, as the Brown trout does not have any fork in it's caudal fin and a brown trout also has a thicker caudal peduncle.  I guess the jury is still out on what exactly I caught? lol"
638027,craigdritchie,2011-11-07 13:56:00,1586,"The jury's not out - it's a brown, trust me.  Some browns do have a slight fork in the caudal fin, and I've seen some fish a few spots on the tail. Fish are like humans - there are some variations in all individuals. The ID charts are a good general guide, but there is always some amount of variance.  I'm not surprised people on an internet forum think it's an Atlantic. Almost any silver fish with spots on it, or that jumps, gets mis-identified as an Atlantic by someone these days.  We all want to believe in these fish - some more than others."
638070,john from craa,2011-11-07 15:12:00,39,"I would also say that is a brown, not an Atlantic.  The photo is not high enough resolution to view the dorsal, but if you close the mouth I bet the jaw extends well past the back of the eye.  It appears to pass the eye when the mouth is open in the photo.  Still a very nice fish.  If you have a high res photo send to me via e-mail and I'll take a closer look to verify.  [emailÂ protected]  As for Dave's post, you highlight two points, targeting out of season fish and taking a photo of OOS fish.  There is no doubt there are more and more people showing up after a rain, usually with float gear and spey rods that no doubt hope to accidently catch one.  But your example of the sturgeon versus a guy tossing a spinner for bass is absurd.  Spinners are one of the top lures for river smallies, so are flies.  They also catch bows, browns, Pacific's and Atlantic's.  A huge ball of worms sitting on the river bottom only catches one specie...sturgeon.  One measure we have asked anglers to follow is simply don't fish in warm water situations, i.e. above 22C water temps.  This unwritten rule applies to resident trout as well.  Closing the river does not make sense either.  Why close down a fishery for bass, steelhead and browns and other fish just because of some incidently caught Atlantic's.  Adult Atlantic salmon are present in the lower river every month of the year (between fresh fish and kelts/drop backs).  Should we all stop fishing for all the other fish we all enjoy because we might catch one.  Where do we draw the line?  With three adult Atlantics found in the Forks last summer perhaps the implications to your fishing ethics are in trouble too.  Tossing a dry or wet fly for browns in the UC and catching an Atlantic is the exact same.  And tossing a dry fly and catching Atlantic parr and smolts is also the exact same.  We all know they are there and we all know that drifting a fly through the Upper Credit has a high probability of catching an Atlantic at any size (far, far, far higher chances versus the lower river).  Yet people still go fishing and catch them every day.  And I have no issue with this at all.  Again, why should we change our fishing if no harm is done and we are fishing for stream trout.  Yet there are days I have landed more Atlantic smolts in the UC than trout in recent years, as have many others.  On the issue of taking a photo of an OOS fish.  The same law applies to rainbow, brown and brook trout in the Upper Credit as they have a zero limit and must be released immediatly to the stream.  Yet you have posted many pics of resident browns that breaks your own ethics (and the law you state above).  Your handling was good, fish were released unharmed and I have done the same and have no issue.  But for you to take exception to one, yet exempt yourself from the same rules is the pot calling the kettle black.  The scenario is the same tossing crank baits for walleye or pike in May and catching a bass on any lake.  It happens to all of us and  most anglers are quick to release the out of season fish unharmed.  But I bet most would take a quick pic of a 5 pound+ bass.  The biggest issue these fish face is mis-identification (both ways).  Anglers reported several grilse killed from Erindale by anglers (and 4 were verified with pics this fall and reported to MNR).  Just like I have found some anglers with buckets of chub and mixed in they had juvenile browns, bows and Atlantic's.  And on other occasions many bass have been kept in May/June from the lower river.  Education is the major concern for protecting all the species.  Take a pic, don't take a pic.  Your choice.  But know your fish, handle them with care and enjoy fishing!  John"
638077,Frank,2011-11-07 15:18:00,74," Well, I guess I'll just file this picture (when I get it developed) under ""Uncertain Species, Brown Trout/Atlantic Salmon""  I hope to get back out fishing Lake O some time this week and hopefully I can latch onto another similar fish and and take more detailed photos of it.  It would be nice if the Atlantic's can sustain a population in Lake O, so we can catch more of these beautiful fish."

I did not think anyone on any forum was wrong in identifying this fish, I have very limited knowledge on trout/salmon species so who am I too argue, that's why I posted earlier, I was going to file it under uncertain species, either way I am glad I got a pic of my trout because I have never caught one before, so it was quite exciting."
638283,Remastered,2011-11-08 00:33:00,143,It just occurred to me that the fish I lost last year in mid-July at Port Credit was an Atlantic. They seem very aggressive so I would say we might have some good pier fishing in the future. Best of luck with the atlantics.
638292,Roy,2011-11-08 00:46:00,13728, No worries Frank. I think it's fair to say that you putting your trout pic up on our board served to educate more than a few others. I saw the thread on the other board. All's well.

637375,Guest chrisrobinson,2011-11-04 14:34:00,0,"Hello Craig,   What is missing from that statement is that the two species are stocked for different reasons.  The Atlantics are not stocked to create a ""viable sport fishery"", that is a straw man argument used by naysayers to create false expectations for the program.  Long term a sustainable fishery is part of the goal, but establishing the population is the first priority.  You also aren't taking biomass stocked into account in your calculations nor the reasoning for the difference in sizes stocked, which goes back to the rationales for stocking each.  Additionally, there is a lot of wild production going on in chinook, supplementing their numbers.  By way of further comparison, the chinook salmon program is on its third attempt.  They were stocked between 1874 and 1881, but ""didn't amount to much"".  Ontario tried again between 1916 and 1925, NY lasted until 1933, but it was a ""dismal failure"".  NY started again in 1969, Ontario in 1971, by 1977 the program was still not considered a success, with ""negligible returns"".  Talking to biologists from that time, they feel the only reason chinooks got a hold was when the sea lamprey control program started to take a bite out of that problem.  So if fisheries managers were as faint-hearted around chinook as some would like them to be around Atlantic salmon, we wouldn't have chinook today.  The rest of the species making up the modern salmon and trout fishery were also tried and failed at various times in the last 130 years.  Species restoration takes time, committment, and adaptive management.  Elk took 13 years for a hunt, and that was only on one of the four populations being re-established.  American eel will take about 90 years to restore in Lake Ontario; lake sturgeon about 300 years if the province tries active restoration, about 400 years if they try passive restoration.  Lake trout restoration is still underway in Lake Ontario.  So for those involved in the program, the truth doesn't hurt because we have realistic expectations of what the program is attempting, the timelines for recovery, and we are seeing those benchmarks exceeded, despite some of the setbacks (two years of hatchery losses) along the way.   Nobody is and nobody involved in the program said we should.  Chinook remain in the Fish Community Objectives as the top predator in the lake, and the other species also have their objectives.  As John from CRAA mentioned, Atlantic salmon are an addition, not a replacement.  Yours in Conseration, Chris Robinson OFAH Atlantic Salmon Program Coordinator"
637376,Hairpy,2011-11-04 14:36:00,73,"Bill, I would disagree that the MNR uses Nipigon brookies to stock all Ontario rivers. Wouldn't that be taking away from the wild population?  The Atlantics are stocked at many life stages to see what works best. Even though the history of stocking Ats in Lake Ontario does not seem to carry much weight we are now seeing results in the creeks and the lake. I don't get to fish much these days but I actually have caught 3 atlantics this fall and 2 in the lake last year out of 3 total outings. They are definatly there and I hope they continue because they are a great addition to an already awesome fishery!!  Joseph"
637386,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-04 15:04:00,0,"ontario uses brood from nipigon, hills lake, etc for their brookie stocking.  eggs and milt are collected from wild fish periodically to form the basis of the next many generations of fish.  these fertilized eggs are separated into ""families"" so that they may be crossed strategically to maintain genetics.  adults whom the eggs/milt are  collected from are screened for disease."

637498,danjang,2011-11-04 22:08:00,148," This adds to my point. These goals won't happen overnight. If we scrap the atlantic salmon program because we don't see the results now, they will NEVER return to Lake Ontario. Should we just scrap all restoration programs because it costs too much? Think about how much money goes to organisms that don't really have an economic value like the red side dace where they essentially built a highway around/over it's habitat. I know this is a fishing forum and this train of thought may not appeal to some people but there is a great deal of value to this program. As a big bonus this program will create a fishery too."
637521,Garnet,2011-11-04 23:24:00,2056,"I hear the argument that maintaining the Atlantic program has contributed to stream rehab.

The first MNR bio tech was just out of school when he was assigned Atlantic restoration and has been retired for some years now.  We need to see this latest plan threw."
637543,Twocoda,2011-11-05 00:31:00,4130,"The Mirimichi River in NB is a world renowned Atlantic salmon fishery that is visited by tourist from all over the world to try their hand at fighting this magnificent species.

Seems this whole endeavour will be for not if they arent protected like they are down east. I honestly think it is a lesser crime in NB and NS to commit an infraction against a human then it is to commit an infraction against a salmon. Will the credit become aâ Flyâ only river? Will there be Atlantic Tags? Will COs be beefed up to prevent flossers and rippers? Heavier Fines?

637553,John Bacon,2011-11-05 01:13:00,3277, I am not sure that we have the same understanding of what a brood stock is. I consider brood stock to be fish raised in captivity for the purpose of producing offspring that are stocked. They are using already sustaining fisheries to create brood stock for Lake Ontario. This takes time because they collect eggs and raise them to adulthood before they begin producing significant numbers of fish to stock.  Are you suggesting they simply harvest the eggs from these self sustaining populations to stock the Lake Ontario watershed? If this strategy were adopted there would be a risk of introducing new diseased or parasites into the Lake Ontario watershed. It would also require a large number of eggs to be removed from the other populations which could impact those populations.  Collection eggs for the creation of brood stock requires fewer eggs to be collected. There are also fewer transfers required and more time to check for deseases before releasing the fish into the watershed.
637650,J-M,2011-11-05 18:44:00,65,"John and Justin,  It's nice to see that the Atlantic program is contributing to stream rehab, i am also curious as to where this stream rehab has been completed and what type of projects have been completed? Is there any rehab being done on any other rivers but the Credit??  Also, I am interested in some further figures John, I would like to know what the cost of raising 'stockable' atlantic salmon is costing, if possible, do you have a breakdown of the cost per fish? say like $.50 per fish stocked or something like that?  I'm no expert, but I've heard fish rearing and stocking can be quite expensive and I would just like to know what the cost of raising an atlantic salmon would cost? Can anyone help me with this?  Thanks  "
637651,J-M,2011-11-05 18:47:00,65," Twocoda, very good points. Right now, atlantic salmon are considered an ""endangered species"" in Lake Ontario. So we can't actually target and fish for atlantics. My quesiton, how long will they be considered an Endangered species before they even let us try to actually target and fish for them? It could be 10, 15, 20 years from now....."
637670,aniceguy,2011-11-05 21:09:00,1094,my understanding is that Atlantics have been classified as extinct now
637757,danjang,2011-11-06 02:41:00,148,The Lake Ontario strain of Atlantic salmon is extinct. I believe the MNR had set the limits for Atlantics in order to help the reintroduction.
637761,Gregoire,2011-11-06 03:11:00,1397,I was just thinking about the fact that some lakes have landlocked salmon. I believe these are genetically classified as Atlantic Salmon. If the whole point of the stocking program is to reintroduce a species why not use this strain?
637762,justin elia,2011-11-06 03:21:00,151," One major improvement to the river has been the construction and completion of the new fishway at Norval.  It was funded partly by a group out the US that donates to projects like this one.  John and I wrote a lengthy application requesting funds for the project and we were awarded partial funding for the entire project.  Another aspect that most are unaware of is the amount of paper work that comes with even the smallest job.  John can probably touch base as to where trees have been planted, banks have been stabilized, etc etc etc.  As far as the a monetary figure associated with fish rearing, I haven't the clue.  We have our own hatchery with Rainbow Trout, Brown Trout, Coho Salmon and Atlantic Salmon that is managed by volunteers of CRAA and funded through government grants.  They are always looking for people to help out with daily chores if you're interested.  Justin"
637765,wallacio,2011-11-06 03:40:00,475,"I find it more than a bit hypocritical that some of the staunchest supporters of this program are the same ones delibertately targetting this fish which has a closed season, often under the guise of ""Bass fishing"" and are posting grip and grin photos.   Granted, you'll catch them when targetting other species which are in season but taking photos of a fish which is not in season is bad form not to mention illegal."
637768,John Bacon,2011-11-06 04:29:00,3277, At least one of the new strains (Sebago Lake) is from a land locked population. I believe the MNR is trying both land locked and ocean going strains to determine which is best for Lake Ontario.  The land locked strains are comming from much smaller lakes than Lake Ontario. They are not necessarily better suited than an ocean going strain.
637803,john from craa,2011-11-06 13:34:00,39,"Funding has gone into the three main tributaries thus far (Credit, Duffins and Cobourg), with some recent work on the Humber and Bronte.  Chris R from OFAH could outline their work on Cobourg and other systems.  Cobourg has had much rehab work as a result.  On the Credit CRAA has done much of the work, but OFAH, TU, CVC and others have done much work related or partially funding from the program too.  As Justin noted, the largest project the program has spurred is the new fishway at Norval Dam on the Credit.  The new fishway opens access for almost 100 hectares of cold water habitat that has been shut off since 1850!  Just how much habitat is that?  It's about the same as Duffins, Cobourg, Oshawa and Wilmot Creeks combined.  I worked on the project for 13 years to make it a reality.  The Atlantic program and funding for the specie, and others like redside dace made it possible to design and build the new fishway.  In recent decades government funds for this sort of work have been very tight.  Managers and NGO's like CRAA plan work to benefit all the species, but the funding has to be targeted at species at risk.  Nobody is interested in funding to help a dace or sucker or a steelhead of chinook.  But bringing back a lost specie has merit from third party, non fishing types.  The Norval fishway has lifted roughly 20 species this year.  Funding was provided for Atlantic salmon, redside dace and American Eel.  Yet we all know the fishway will benefit dace, chub, sucker, bows, browns, bass, etc, etc.  The fishway cost roughly $300k for design and build plus siginificant in kind.  CRAA funded about 40% of the project though Species at Risk (MNR), CFWIP (MNR) and the National Fish and Wildlife Fund from the US that Justin noted.  Behind the scenes these funding apps take hundreds of hours for volunteers to write, administer, complete accounting and work with contractors and MNR staff.  CRAA has completed between 3 and 4 million dollars worth of rehab aimed at all species.  But in recent years the Atlantics have added to our success in finding every more scarce funding sources.  The last 5 years has seen maybe 25,000 trees, a dozen ponds removed or bottom drawn, and many other small scale rehab works as a result of the program  As for cost of rearing fish...I have no idea.  MNR just invested a great deal of money in Normandale as a result of the program, and that has made space for chinooks as well.  The cost for each age group should be somewhat similar, except food costs might vary.  Example is young chinooks eat a lot more food than young Atlantics and bows so maybe their cost is a little higher due to food.  I would guess Atlantic and steelhead will have similar costs at the hatchery since they have a similar growth pattern.  I guess from Wallicio's comment we should not be fishing the river at all.  I have fished for smallies and chinooks/coho/bows for 25-30 years and just because we catch some Atlantic's I'm not about to change my fishing heritage.  Having a quick photo certainly benefits with fish id and confirmation and is not illegal as Dave attemps to point out.  As long as the fish is released immediatly and unharmed your following the laws.  Like any release, proper handling is important. Perhaps we can make little signs up for the roe bags and flys that say ""not for Atlantics"".  Teaching the fish to read...that might take time.  As for strains, MNR has different protcols depending on the source to control disease.  Fish from same waters, fish from elsewhere in the province and fish from out of province and each has a different level of control.  It is not a simple case of driving to NB and picking up 100k of eggs and driving home.  The rules require either the eggs come from a certified disease free hatchery, in which case they still test the eggs and various life stages of the fry and adults.  If not certified they require the body of each adult to be tested for a hige lineup of diseases.  The rules are hard to work with, but better this than the potential disaster unfolding on the West Coast where Infectous Salmon Anemia has likely spread from fish farms to wild BC salmon.  Controling things like VHS and Whirling disease are prime examples.  Atlantics are now classified as extinct.  Classic government screw up as we catch more now than ever.  Is that extinct?  As for a season and fishing, I would hope in a few years we will see a catch and release season.  The end goal is a viable self sustaining population with a sport fishery.  But that is in the future.  I doubt we will see Maritime type of rules, but having some sections restrited to no bait or fly only might be a good option for management and attracting new investment, but never the whole river.  The specie went extinct mainly from dams, habitat damage and comercial fishing.  So as long as we have strict harvest controls angling should be fine.  John"
637809,wallacio,2011-11-06 13:56:00,475,"Funny, there sure are a lot more ""Bass fishermen"" on the river these days after a rain in August swinging flies and spinners through the tailouts.   If anyone asks, when I hook a Lake Sturgeon on the Notty in May with giant gobs of worms I'm fishing for Suckers...  Further, on the topic of photographing OOS fish, the regs state that they are to be released IMMEDIATELY and I'm pretty sure that posing for ""grip and grin"" photos do not count as an immediate release.   Don't believe me?   Here's more info on the same subject directly from the MNR.   Excerpt from this link:  http://www.outdoorontario.net/AskMNR/mnrfaqfish.html  Question 186:  Hi, if an angler has incidental catches of any species (out of season) & has a posed picture taken with the fish out of the water prior to being released, is it unethical, against the regulations etc, or perfectly fine, providing care was given to the fish?  Asked August 25, 2003  Answer from the MNR  This is very technically a violation because the fish is not immediately released to the water. Of course, the actions of the angler in their handling of the fish will determine whether a charge is warranted and would be laid by a Conservation Officer. Think of it this way. The speed limit on the 401 is 100km/hr. Very few drivers will be charged with driving 101km/hr, but given the right set of circumstances, there may be perfectly legitimate reasons why an officer might write a ticket for doing 101km/hr in a 100km/hr zone. The only way to be 100% sure that you will not be charged is to immediately return any incidentally caught fish to the water and to release it in a manner that causes the least harm to the fish."
637890,aniceguy,2011-11-06 22:35:00,1094,"Dave I see where your point is leading to here.  One thing any program needs to continue in particular when outside funding is sought is some form of a deliverable.  Something tangible that provides proof that regardless of quality a program is taking roots and funding should continue, Iâm sure your very aware of this as your rather in tune with most issues. A few years back sanctuary licenses were issued to MNR staff, private citizens, OFAH, and some members of CRAA for the exact purpose of providing some deliverables. What happened was short of amazing, 100 plus Atlantics caught captured and transferred above Norval to assist in creating a self-sustaining fish, a byproduct hundreds upon hundreds of fall rainbows were also transferred, and I assure you if not for the salar they would never have gotten that ride.  If a ""grip and grin"" was required as part of the process I believe it served its point to provide an optical record of the catch. Sadly Cronzy and many I believe even you quietly bashed the entire process from an optical perspective, adhering to internet forum posts as gospel, and not taking the path to finding the truth. The fish were caught and brought in some cases 500 yards in a plastic bag with water to a holding tank, eventually transferred above Norval, a huge daunting task, sadly due to the Cronzy's of the world the program was ended due to optics by the MNR, Iâm sure the managers are kicking themselves here and every single steelheader should push to have the program run to provide the maximum deliverable  End result was the catch rate at the ladder at Streesville dropped to less than half of what it was yet the run had an exponential increase.  Obviously the Chinooks in the ladder at the same time displaced the Atlantics and as a result they fall back to the various staging pools to never go ahead of Streetsville, hence the need for scientific collectors permits.  Virtually no fall rainbows are transferred now and we have MNR trying and failing at an exponential rate to do what was accomplished via a scientific permit by individuals who wanted to see something work.  The side benefit of this permit was also the unfettered transfer of Fall Rainbows above Norval, in the next few years those returning fish will be a huge benefit to the fall run on the Credit something lots here will enjoy.  Itâs a slippery slope when someone accuses someone of breaking the law when all the facts arenât in place, grip and grin might very well been part of a scientific collectors permit and required as a method of providing deliverables on a project, has that occurred to you?  Are you aware of the specific protocols involved with these past permits? I have had dozens and dozens of emails, facebook messages, texts and crap on a rivers edge on this same question, by many who just dont understand the process, I though you would have known a bit more on this.  Seriously Dave you need to re think things before you post and figure out if your post is just part of the problem of providing information on fishing boards that is in accurate and can lead to a false assumption.  Someone one said never ASSUME the connotation of it is quite clear.  Please make sure your posting information thatâs correct in the future.  If youâre unsure Iâm sure you have many folks you can contact and my number is always a dial away, sorry if this was harsh Dave but posting someone is breaking a law without all the facts...........well.sorry mods delete if it crossed a line"
637896,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-06 22:54:00,0,"i just wanted to add that atlantic salmon are extirpated, not extinct. great discussion here folks."
637905,aniceguy,2011-11-06 23:22:00,1094,"thier designation is extinct, an MNR group  has them clasified as that, extinct and in a recovery program,unless they changed it in the last 4 weeks"
637906,wallacio,2011-11-06 23:33:00,475,"My final thoughts on this subject:  My comments have absolutely NOTHING to do with the santuary licenses that were granted in past years.   Unlike others, I did not have an issue with the licenses nor with the practise of angling under this license for study/assessment purposes.  Correct me if I'm wrong but the santuary licences were not issued this year yet you and I both know full well that Atlantic Salmon are being deliberately targetted in the river at certain times of the year (ie July, August) and with species-specific tactics including by members of your organizations ""executive"".    Please don't insult our collective intelligence by citing that other species are being targetted as part of some ""hertitage pursuit"" and that Atlantics are simply by-catch.    THIS is what I take exception to...ie the continued deliberate targetting of a species for which the season is closed.   I used the Sturgeon analogy to demonstrate how ridiculous and dishonest it is to cite by-catch as a defense.  In fact, many sections of rivers in Ontario are now full or part time sanctuaries so that anglers could not hide behind the by-catch loophole.  Further, as previously I stated one cannot avoid catching them in legal pursuit of other species (ie Steelhead, Salmon, Bass etc).  With that said, the regs state one is to release them immediately and not snap hero shots of them if you do catch one.  Again, I am referring to present day...one of the photos posted in this thread with a fish being held for a photo shows the date (September 2011) in the file name so this fish was not caught with a sanctuary license (feel free to correct this assumption if not accurate).  I actually want to see this program succeed and have no doubt that our rivers are already better places thanks to the efforts under the program.   My only point is that fishing regulations should be obeyed by ALL of us at all times.   This point should not be difficult to agree with..."
637920,danjang,2011-11-07 00:24:00,148," I photograph the Atlantics I catch to send in to CRAA. Although I know my fish, it's tough for CRAA to determine numbers if everyone said they caught an Atlantic without hard proof. They can get an idea of size, sex and if it had one, tag numbers."
637921,Remastered,2011-11-07 00:51:00,143,I would agree that Atlantic Salmon are increasing. I caught my first one ever this past February on the lower credit. I say we give it more time before jumping to conclusions because by the looks of it the runs have been growing much stronger the past few years.
636959,Musky or Specks,2011-11-03 01:02:00,2710,"I like the sentiment but there is also this thing called evolution and environmental factors are part of it and mankind, we suck as ecological partners. If the program was being successful then I'd have no problem funding it with tax dollars. But as its been mentioned the program is a colossal failure. Three fish??? That's not success by any definition. Were not even talking about creating a fishery which would at least have some intrinsic value. The thing that kills me is the headwaters of these streams are under intense urban pressure and I don't see the cold water resource surviving another 50 years particularly the Credit and the Oakridge moraine. In my lifetime I've watched population after population of wild native trout wiped out in the name of revenue and I expect nothing less from our governing bodies in the future."
636964,craigdritchie,2011-11-03 01:10:00,1586,"Thing is John, five years is in itself too long without some signs of success. It doesn't take five years to produce significant results with any others species of salmonid - even lake trout, which grow far more slowly than Atlantic salmon.  Said it before and I will repeat it here - stock 500,000 coho or rainbows, and you'll see amazing results in 18 months - not five years. Why are we still waiting? Why do I feel like Linus waiting for the Great Pumpkin to show up?  The numbers stocked are well into the millions ..... and nothing!  On the basis of the sheer numbers stocked, we should all be catching dozens of small Atlantics each year, and that just isn't happening. I know a charter operator in Port Credit who has boated six of them in his entire life. Six! How does he make a living on that?  Believe me - I would love to see Atlantic salmon succeed. But it has been 25 years of excuses. We have stocked millions of fish. And, they're sending out press releases celebrating the fact they saw three fish in the Credit River. If that doesn't constitute complete and total failure, then what does?"
636965,landry,2011-11-03 01:16:00,1005,Craig is dead right!!! Good idea initially but it is time to throw in the towel and spend the $ on fish that will succeed. Supporting/revitalizing wild fisheries is a great idea if the habitat can sustain or support it. It can't - so pack it in! The focus on wild/indigenous stocking is like a religious cult in the MNR nowadays. Not saying we should have cookie cutter steelhead in the thousands in our rivers like the U.S. Erie tribs BUT at least open your eyes to reality  = HABITAT DEGRADATION.   
636985,BillM,2011-11-03 02:06:00,17367, No wonder the resident browns I catch keep getting bigger and bigger   Great feed!  I'd love to see just 1 or 2 stocking seasons of cohos or steelhead.  People would crap their pants at the return.
636999,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-03 03:44:00,655,"Craig, you are making a statement that is misleading. There are more and more Atlantics caught recently. A friend of mine (Justin Elia from this board) caught a bunch of Atlantics from the Credit this year, let alone the other anglers that had success. Justin caught and released six Atlantics one morning alone this year himself! That was unheard of even in the past couple years. Rome was not built in a day, and other species took a long time to naturalize from scratch in Lake Ontario that are much less sensitive than Atlantics. Stream restoration will be a big part of any Atlantic naturalization success. That is currently being worked on now thanks to the OMNR, OFAH, Trout Unlimited, CRAA, HRCA etc.  To be honest, I used to be opposed to the Atlantic program before I saw the whole picture. All that I saw before was a lot of $$ going into a program that didn't work. Like many, I thought it was ridiculous to spend so much time and money on something that wasn't working and would displace non-indiginous thriving salmonid species that we all love.  After opening my mind and looking at the whole picture, I see things much differently now. Kings, browns and bows are not being displaced, the fishery is still healthy despite heavy Atlantic efforts.  Stream rehab is being done in much larger scales to benefit our natural resources, protect what we have and help our Lake Ontario fishery as a whole. An extinct Atlantic salmon has special powers to protect and enhance the streams, rivers and spawning grounds for all Lake Ontario fish, including bass. Aquatic insects, the food chain and wildlife will also benefit from the re-introduction of an extinct Atlantic salmon. Builders may also be forced to take special care while building up around our tributaries. No other fish species have the ability to help in this magnitude, and mostly from funding that would not be there otherwise.  And now a lot more people are catching Atlantic salmon. Heck, I even saw my first Atlabntic this year hahaha. It took many years for steelhead, browns and Chinook to naturalize into Lake Ontario, it will take Atlantics a while as well, all the while benefiting Lake Ontario, its tributaries and other fish, aquatic life and wildlife as a whole.  People are opposed to the Atlantic program that have not opened their mind, and do not see the full picture. Fear mongering with ignorance is the culprit.  As long as our beloved Chinook, browns and steelhead continue to thrive in Lake Ontario, what harm can the Atlantic program do? It's a good thing for Lake Ontario, the tribs and anglers, even if some don't see it yet.  I am convinced the Atlantic program is a good thing after opening my eyes."
637004,craigdritchie,2011-11-03 05:37:00,1586,"Thanks for your thoughts Aaron, and I appreciate your views. But accusing me of misleading anyone is something I take very seriously, so please allow me to respond. I'll apologize right now for the long post.  First off, what exactly have I mislead people about?  I wrote that Ontario has been stocking Atlantic salmon for 25 years, and to date have poured several million of them into Lake Ontario. Click on this link and you can see for yourself that the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission fish stocking database shows Ontario stocking Atlantic salmon every single year from 1986 to 2004. You can add it up for yourself and see that over that 18 year span, the Ontario government poured a grand total of 2,546,391 Atlantic salmon in Ontario streams. Divide that total by 18 years and you have an average of 141,466 Atlantic salmon stocked each and every year, for 18 solid years. Thatâs a lot of fish! Sadly, the database has no record for 2005, but there is no reason to believe the number of fish stocked that year would have been any different.  When the program entered its âcurrentâ phase in 2006, annual plants increased to 500,000 fish per year. If you read this MNR news announcement from 2008, it proudly notes that between 2006 and 2008 MNR stocked more than one million Atlantic salmon in Ontario streams. Thatâs 500,000 fish per year, and stocking levels have remained consistent at 500,000 per year ever since. This gives us an additional 2.5 million Atlantics stocked since 2006. Add the 2.5 million stocked between 1986 and 2004, and we have a grand total in excess of 5 million Atlantic salmon stocked into Lake Ontario over the past 25 years. So I clearly didnât mislead anyone on the numbers of fish stocked, or the amount of time this program has been dragging on.  I also wrote that the results of this stocking program have been disappointing, to say the least.  Is that how I misled people? From the CRAA's own website: ""CRAA monitored for returns, although they were very rare throughout the 1993 to 2007 era."" Over a period of 14 years, CRAA volunteers could count the total number of Atlantics they saw on one hand.  Also from CRAA's website: ""Returns of adult salmon to the Credit River have been growing, with 49 in 2008, 75 in 2009 and possibly over 200 in 2010."" Add in a handful of others that wandered up other creeks or were caught by anglers, and you might come up with another 100 or 150 fish in total. A generous estimate might peg the total number at about 500 salmon, in total, over a three-year span. Thatâs a generous average of 167 fish per year.  Stock 500,000 fish per year, and have maybe 167 come back to be caught by anglers or show up at your fishway. I wrote that I felt this was a lousy return on investment, and I donât feel I misled anyone there either.  Now letâs look at what you had to say.  You wrote that Justin Elia caught a bunch of Atlantics in the Credit this year. By catching six fish in one morning, Justin has had more success than a professional charter boat operator I know who, for the past several years, has been on the lake four or five days a week for most of the summer. Quite an accomplishment, to be sure, but it would certainly be misleading to suggest this happens on any kind of regular basis.  By the way, was Justin fishing in the fish sanctuary with the special permit that a number of the CRAA members have? If so, then Iâm a lot less impressed. Because letâs face it, the average guy just doesnât have that opportunity.  I also find your comment âIt took many years for steelhead, browns and chinook to naturalize into Lake Ontarioâ¦â to be a bit misleading, for it is simply incorrect. Check MNRâs stocking records and youâll see that coho were stocked into the Credit River in 1968. Read any fishing magazine from that period and youâll also see that the first significant coho runs into the Credit occurred in the fall of 1969. That isnât a very long time at all, certainly not ""many years.""  MNRâs records further show that chinook were introduced to Bronte Creek in 1974. By 1978 Darryl Choronzy was writing in Ontario Out Of Doors magazine about the fantastic chinook fishing off Bronte. That isnât âmany yearsâ either.  By the way Aaron, weâre not talking about establishing wild populations - just surviving long enough to contribute to a fishery or at the very least, make it back to a fishway.  And how many years have we been waiting for the Atlantics? Oh yes, since 1986. Hmmm.  There are a lot of misleading statements about the Atlantic salmon program, and coming from all sides. Some may come from people who are critical of the program, to be sure. Others might come from biologists who are simply trying to protect their jobs. And others still could come from angling groups that benefit by using the salmon program as a way to generate revenue. And sure, there are probably one or two guys who only support it because it lets them go fish in the sanctuary every now and then.  But the numbers don't lie. More than five million fish stocked. A return rate measured in the thousandths of a percent. No room in the hatchery for coho, rainbows and browns that will contribute to the fishery, because all the space is occupied by Atlantic salmon that for all intents and purposes only exist on paper.  My eyes have been open a long time, which is all the more reason I remain convinced this program is a complete and total sham. I have a lot of respect for your opinion Aaron, but this is one topic upon which we will have to agree to disagree.    Edit - fixed a typo. It's 2:00 in the morning and I'm tired!"
637008,Aaron Shirley,2011-11-03 07:59:00,655," This is what I meant by misleading. My apologies for offending you, that was not my intention. There are a lot more Atlantics entering the Credit than three. There are actual signs that an Atlantic fishery may be possible with growing numbers annually. Keep in mind that Atlantic salmon are much more sensitive to the environment and habitat degradation than kings, browns and steelies, and it will take more effort and a longer period of time to have a naturalized population of Atlantic salmon. Of course nobody can predict the future, but things are finally looking up at least.  Also, keep in mind that charter guys are not targeting Atlantic salmon. They are a unique fish that people will have to figure out. How long did it take for people to figure out the blue zone for bows and hos?  As far as I know Justin was not fishing in a sanctuary, just average Joe fishing.  I got your PM, thanks. I'd love to chat with you more about this.  All the best,  Aaron"
637018,Gregoire,2011-11-03 10:47:00,1397," I believe that you fish a lot of the slamon tournaments every year. What do you think would happen to the King population is the stocking programs for them where stopped in favour of stocking Atlantics, which I believe is a possibility right now. Others may be able to provide more information on this, but I believe one of the stocking programs for Kings is being threatened with closure right now."
637019,Musky or Specks,2011-11-03 11:07:00,2710,"The Atlantic salmon has no special designation as a species and has no power to protect the environment. If you are being told this you are being mislead. Builders will pay lip service only to any habitat and the OMB will overrule any attempt to stop building in sensitive habitats. Remember that cold water habitat is formed by recharge areas. Recharge areas are large tracts of land which slowly absorb rainwater back into the aquifer. You may protect the riparian zone but you won't save the recharge areas.  That's not fear mongering or misleading people that's the cold hard truth. I've participated in a program that had an entire large city council on board. An environmental watershed wide assessment in place before any development could proceed to protect the last trout stream in the city of Waterloo. That's last, no more, extinct. OMB used the environmental watershed assessment to wipe its collective ass with as they paved over the entire area with houses and driveways. Needless to say NO MORE COLDWATER and no more trout. The Upper Credit is headed the same way and the Atlantic Salmon will not save it."
637022,Garnet,2011-11-03 11:56:00,2056,"I was part of the groups that started the Atlantic program (Bowmnaville Creek Anglers, Durham Region Anglers). We went in person to MNR Minister Newmans office looking for stocking. His statement was Atlantic's were a Heritage Species and part of his mandate.  We also got some brown trout stocking in Bowmanville Creek, Oshawa Creek and a couple others.  This lead to a trip for MNR and Club members to New Brunswick, New Hampshire. I didn't get to go but 1 guy was diligent at picking up every piece of paper, every study. I diffidently was the only one to read every scrap of paper.  Over and over in this materiel it states how easy Atlantic's are caught with flashy, spinning metal. And we are dumping them into Lake O.  I heard reports this year of Atlantics being caught off Oshawa pier. These were most likely Pink Salmon. And any reports of Atlantic catches not professionally verified are most likely Pink's.  A few years later we took the MNR on! Yes it was a fight to have chinnooks stock east of the Rouge River. Close door strategy meetings throwing out MNR staff. Press releases. Newspaper articles, late night phone calls from the most senior MNR staff. We had professional Dale Carnegie speakers presenting our information. And eventually we had this policy dropped.  Good memories and lot's more Bowmanville Fishway, helping Metro East Steelheaders and Credit River Steelheaders get going, starting live release steelhead tourneys ending catch and kill derby's."
637023,BillM,2011-11-03 12:22:00,17367,"Out in the lake, people confuse browns with atlantics more then any other species.  How many times have we had a threads here asking us to identify fish, lol."
637025,John Bacon,2011-11-03 12:26:00,3277," No, five years is not enough because the first hatchlings will be used to create a brood stock, which is then used to produce large quantities of fish for stocking. Eggs can be harvested from three year old fish but they are small and don't have very good survival rates. It takes at least a four year old female to produce quality eggs for hatching. Then it would take another three or four years before the offspring of the those fish return to rivers. So you would be looking at a minimum of seven years before you begin to see significant results from a new strain. The 10 year point would be a good time to access the success of a new strain.  Unfortunately the MNR continues to stock the lahav's which we already know are not successful. The lehav numbers should not be included in the totals when accessing the returns versus numbers stocked.  The most promising strain is the Restigouche which the MNR hasn't even worked with at all."
637026,BillM,2011-11-03 12:31:00,17367, Why not use broad stock from out east?
637034,aniceguy,2011-11-03 13:16:00,1094," Look outside the box on this fish, the returns are dismal no doubt there, the money is from the private sector, the MNR still has to spend I ll wager double what comes from the private sector in inkind work and actual staff and salary so our money is being spent.  Yes the money could have gone to lots of other fish, maybe or it could have gone to a mole in Quebec, a frog in BC or a salamander in Newfoundland from the wine folks and MNR money could have been spent on other things,  it didnât and it went right here locally in our backyards and thats a point no one has bothered to make that when a corporate entity looks to spend marketing money on a cause it can go anywhere again it came here be very thankful of it as. I assure you other corporates look at this sort of push back on salar and decide why invest in Ontario and its fisheries, outside the box and big picture stuff wouldnt we want say Mercedes Benz to donate 2 million to elk restoration etc...push back kils this sort of thing, trust me I have heard it right to my face  Sorry musky and Specks while most of your post was dead on some is polar opposites, outside of the box this fish is leading to less water taking permits in some watersheds,( I believe the Bronte watershed will have a 20% plus decrease in its new FMP)due to primarily to redside dace but the salar had an impact as its the next stream for re introduction, a developer was stopped from building in streetsville due to his land in a recharge area, and it was ruled he needed to be top of bank, from my understanding it didnt even go to OMB due to a viewed potential negative outcome, even though laws are not in place the optics still lead some to walk away and this benefits our watersheds  A more stringent review of Environmental assessments, if you look at the guidelines to recharge areas it has changed in the last few years, granted its only wording and the fines associated to a builder as squat change that and now  its a huge step in the right dirrection. Stronger enforcement of development, on the Credit an incident was noted within two days it was dealt with via MOE and DFO/MNR the developer was advised and he from my understanding changed his discharge methods, small step but fish habitat has come a lot higher on the table due to redside dace and the salar within the credit watershed and while its not all hope and good news it moves in the right direction, its not a finite process but one with a lot of baby steps   A new fish ladder in Norval was built both from private funds and MNR funding, its a shame politics isnt allowing jumping and non jumping species access above Norval, I could cite about 50 other outside of the box programs or enhancements that came from the awareness this fish brought.  I am meeting with a large corporate entity today to discuss their proposal for a Quarry in the lower watershed, 20 yrs. ago wouldnât even be a blip in terms of the permits, yet now requires the permit requester to meet with Non-Governmental agencies to work through the issues, while it might only be optics and the OMB could very well side with a proponant its all a step in the right direction, that corporate knows that the optics of being a good corporate citizen is valuable to its branding ( I think Craig knows this one).  The fish has provided less than dismal angling opportunities and if any of us look at it from that one single perspective it was an utter complete waste in every regard as it has not provided a measurable angling opportunity, but once you look outside the box and can grasp the peripheral benefits, and can ""ride the coat tails"" to improve opportunities for other fish and wild life species you see that this program has a very measurable effect on the fishery you and I love. As to Streetsville, yes it can now be on full flow through and all the fish can access Norval and once past that to heaven, sadly due to groups such as Trout Unlimited, Isaac Walton fly fishing, rainbows Chinooks Cohoâs etc., are not allowed above the Norval dam, while the Atlantic program got it built (although CRAA kicked in 60k from a US funding source) it sits right now as a rotting structure due to social matters, personally if I was an angler I would be calling the MNR daily to ask why rainbows coho's chinooks and every other single fish isnt allowed above Norval to spawn and do the best thing for the river create naturally self sustaining fish species because right there that single call, email or letter has more impact then any internet thread"
637049,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-03 14:34:00,0,every time a thread like this comes it's amazing the amount of experts that come out when they read something somewhere.  and for some reason i always feel like i'm being lectured in my own area of specialization.  i won't engage in this never ending debate but i will say that i'm educated in and have 8 years in fisheries management and i support the reintroduction of the atlantic salmon.  sound fisheries management does not base it's decisions on recreational angling alone and this is one of those cases.
637054,dave524,2011-11-03 14:47:00,4508," Also this is not the first time that there has been a majour effort to reintroduce the Atlantics to Lake Ontario, the start of the hatchery programs in Ontario were mostly to reintroduce Atlantics , check the stocking figures on page 155 of this document.  http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodconsume/groups/lr/@mnr/@letsfish/documents/document/mnr_e001346.pdf  edit: page 164 , seems the adobe page numbers don't match the document page numbers"
637062,bucktail,2011-11-03 15:21:00,1857,I have to agree that the Atlantic stocking is a huge dissapointment. The one thing we can't do is compare the introductiion of coho's and chinooks to Lake Ontario At that time Lake O had probably 20x as much alewives and smelt that it does now. The pacific salmon were itroduced into a complete ecologiical void with no predators and a almost endless supply of food. The Atlantics are being introduced into a Lake that has had its biatfish numbers crash and also they have millions of other salmon and trout to compete against.  Just something to consider.  darren
637063,justin elia,2011-11-03 15:27:00,151,"Great discussion everyone.  Its always a hot topic on most chat boards.  Sounds like we have some very passionate anglers in Ontario wanting to make a change for the better no matter how we all view things.  As per Craigs comment: Not that I have to justify anything to anyone, but I noticed one comment asking if I was fishing in a sanctuary while catching Atlantics this fall.  Just because CRAA, OFAH and MNR had sanctuary permits to capture and transfer Atlantic Salmon, Rainbow and Brown Trout a few years back does mean we have a free run of the sanctuary every year.  FYI Craig, I would have much rather landed and released fish at my feet opposed to humping sometimes up to 500 yards with 60lbs bags of water and fish, truck them 20 miles up stream just so they have an opportunity to spawn.   Its the everyday angler on the Credit and Lake Ontario that benefits from our work.  I choose to give back to a resource I use quite a bit.  You may want to reconsider your thoughts on the whole sanc process and what CRAA has done.  As for the Atlantics this year, the Credit has seen very high levels of returns for Atlantic Salmon.  Aaron is correct in mentioning that one morning in early September after a rain I had landed 6 Atlantics between THE 403 AND THE LAKE.  There have been countless reports of Atlantics in the Credit since the Summer, in fact anglers are still catching them to date in the lower stretches.  To those that are opposed to the Atlantic Program, all I can say it is working!  The north shore of Lake Ontario and its watersheds will benefit substantially from this program.  Every river will eventually benefit from this and your steelhead numbers will increase, brown trout numbers will increase, habitat will improve etc etc.  I have seen it first hand and before anyone makes a snap judgement simply based on what a few 'nay' sayers think, I encourage them to spend a little more time on the Credit River to see what's really happening.    "
637073,J-M,2011-11-03 16:42:00,65,"Hi Justin, you mention the Credit has seen a high level of atlantic salmon returns. Just curious if you have any hard numbers to back this up, I'm a numbers person and high levels can mean quite a few different things.  If the MNR can produce accurate numbers on atlantic returns which amount to something significant, you won't have a problem convincing us that its working."
637086,justin elia,2011-11-03 17:59:00,151,"J-M, you're right and I should address what I meant.  The only hard evidence I have are my own reports and pictures from various anglers on the river.  John gets emailed frequently with angler catch reports for Atlantic Salmon in the river.   I am not saying that we have 1000 Atlantic Salmon running the Credit, but they have become quite common, my guess would be around 500 this year.  How they are managed by the MNR and OFAH is out of our control and sometimes the best resource of information is by anglers fishing the river itself and not necessarily based on one capturing area in Streestville.  Those that know the river well, know that fish do get over Streetsville.  There is a huge gap between Streetsville and Norval and south of the Dam in Streetsville to the Lake.  We have had numerous reports of spawning Atlantic Salmon in the lower river and based on the catch numbers, I have no idea where these fish are.  Between the guys in our club, we have probably put 100 Atlantic Salmon to the bank this fall.  Unfortunately, a lot of Atlantic Salmon do not get accounted for in the MNR's numbers.  I do not benefit from the program personally, I just agree with it and have seen over the past 4 years the increase in reported catches outside from what MNR numbers show.  Those who choose not to believe me, its really  no sweat off my back.  The Credit RIver is thriving, the watershed is changing for the better, more anglers are starting to fish the river and benefitting from the work being done by various groups.  Catch rates are up for all species.  Thats what matters to me most.    "
637087,Jon,2011-11-03 18:03:00,209,"I was hoping to spend some time writing a response to two of Craig's comments in particular, but that likely wouldn't be for a few days and I would like to respond while the topic is popular so here goes. I am hoping that these numbers provide a bit more context on the discussion. And before I begin, I do know Craig, and although we haven't spoken in a while, I appreciate his background and concern.  First of all, the three adults fish were captured, not observed. Put into perspective, that was from only sampling about 700 metres of stream on two days in August. Based on the numbers of fish reported by MNR staff, anglers, CRAA members and others, I am pretty confident in saying we caught only a small number of the adult fish returning to the Credit this year. And by a similar argument, since we didn't catch a single Chinook Salmon at any sites where Chinooks should be found in the Credit in 2011 and only three juveniles in 2010, the Chinook program must not be working either.  Secondly, stocking numbers for Chinooks are also available from the same database that Craig mentioned. I would like to break down the numbers in more detail (i.e. American vs. Canadian stocking numbers and stocking numbers by year) but haven't had the time.  Very simply then, according to the GLFC database, since 1969 and excluding the years for which there is no data, for whatever reason, there have been just under 76 million Chinooks stocked in Lake Ontario. Yes, 76 million!!! And that doesn't include the number reproducing on their own. Compare that to the over 5 million Atlantics stocked in the lake since 1986 (for some reason the database doesn't include the recent ramped-up stocking numbers in Ontario that equates to over 2 million additional fish), and I am not surprised we see Chinooks returning in large numbers while the Atlantic returns are low so far.  I do have additional comments on the benefits of the restoration associated with the Atlantic Salmon program, the economics of raising 76 million fish and a bunch of the other points but they will have to wait for another day - I have to get back to work.   Jon"
637101,john from craa,2011-11-03 18:49:00,39,"Great passion.  It would be awesome to see that much energy put into rehabilitation, access, sustainable harvest and public education.  I have a biology degree, did my thesis on the Credit's cold water fishery and have volunteered an estimated 20,000 hours to making many of the north shore tribs a better place for fish and anglers so I would argue I am up to speed on the program more than most.  I am also the only person to serve on both the original Atlantic salmon committee and two of the present day committees.  And I am 100% supportive of the reintroduction of Atlantic salmon.  I love steelies, chinooks, coho, browns, brookies and lakers, but Atlantic's are a great addition to our fishery.  As a game fish, for expanding angling opportunities and the fact they are a native specie. The program is not perfect and has had many hurdles, some placed by MNR themselves.  The lack of huge returns to keep anglers happy is no doubt the biggest hurdle.  However the program has good goals and the new program (2006 to present) has better design, planning and real effort behind it for the first time.  I would argue there is some common mis-information or half truths posted in this thread that I hear often.  I hope you enjoy my take on the matter.  I appologize up front for being long winded.  First, the 14"" Atlantic mentioned above was most likely a 3 year old smolt, not a fish from the lake.  However, it is possible for a fry to hit the lake and return at that size with one summer in the lake.  We see this with steelhead, where some stay for 3 years in the river and some leave after 1 year and after a year in the lake are 12-14"".  But my bet is 3 years in the stream by a long shot.  The most common age we have seen thus far for returning Atlantic salmon locally is 2 stream years and 1 lake year, so age 3 and averaging 22-25"" in length and 4 to 5.8 pounds.  I have to say if we are going to discuss stocking and numbers it is neccisary to inform all readers what each age means and how they compare.  To say the MNR stocked 500,000 Atlantic fry and 500,000 chinook fingerlings and call that equal is like comparing apples and oranges.  One must also look at the size (weight) and strain of the fish for the discussion.  A 1 gram Atlantic fry is not the same as a 30 gram steelhead smolt.  Atlantic salmon, coho and steelhead seem to follow a similar juvenile life patterns (stream life).  18-24 months in the stream, then smolt to the lake.  Chinook only spend 1-2 months in the stream.  They have adapted to produce large eggs and large fry that leave the river fast.  The river has the most predators and the greatest threat of all, high temps in summer and freezing in winter.  By avoiding these two extremes chinook have adapted well to maximize the most stable habitat, the lake (or ocean originally).  The hatchery process greatly accelerates this process for chinook too, by hatching eggs in December and extending feeding prior to lake life to as much as 6 months.  Chinook fry in the wild are 1gram in May, whereas hatchery chinook ate 5-7 grams in early may and average 4-5 grams at stocking in mate April.  A 7 gram chinook can eat a 1 gram chinook.  The majority of Atlantic stocking has been 1 gram Atlantic fry, and even the larger fish have to spend 2-18 months in the river that the chinook do not.  Look at numbers:  These are for the Credit specifically: 2006 to 2009 (grilse return years of 2008-2011).  Year,    Fry,    Fingerling,   Yearling,    First adult year,    Return estimate 2006,    124000,   50500,      28200,      (grilse age 2008),    Estimate 49 (only grilse (3-6 pound fish) 2007,    148000,     500,          0,      (grilse age 2009),    Estimate 75 (mostly grilse, some 2 lake year fish to 8-9 pounds) 2008,     94800,   31600,      31900,      (grilse age 2010),    Estimate 200 (grilse, more 7-9 lb fish and a few 10-13 pound fish) 2009,    233000,  150216,      43140,      (grilse age 2011),    Ongoing this fall.  Best guess will be 400-500. (Up to 17 lbs seen)  Totals  590100  232816     103240  926156 total over 4 years.  Expressed as a yearling equivelent, (I have used 1:15 for fry and 1:5 for fingerlings), this gives us a total of 188,400 over 4 years.  These yearling fish (or equivelents) will still spend 2-18 months in the stream after this point.  But this gives us a better comparsion to stocking of other species.  100% of these fish are LaHave River strain, from 4th-5th generation Ontario MNR hatchery brood stock.  New strains only begin stocking 2011-2012 and will show any returns in 2013-2014 or later.  The program is not producing adults like the chinook (40+ years adaption), coho (40+ years adaption) or steelhead (110 years adaption).  However, the returns have increased with more stocking and so have the returns of adult Atlantic salmon.  This clearly shows success and an upward trend of returns.  Lets talk about fish sightings/catches.  2008 about 10 were reported to me from anglers, plus ones we collected from the fishway or sanctuary by fishing, electroshocking and siene netting.  In 2009 about 15 were reported from anglers.  In 2008 I personally saw 4 Atlantics the entire fall in the fishway channel.  In 2009 I saw about 8 the entre fall.  In 2010 I had over 50 angler reports (verified from pictures from sources I don't trust on ID).  In one morning I counted over 30 pass through the ladder and saw them 1 out of 2-3 checks on the fishway channel.  This fall today is the first day I have not seen an Atlantic in the fishway channel since early September.  Some days I saw 10-15, other days 1-5, but every time I looked, they were there.  Yes, there were 50-200 chinooks and some bows and the odd brown and coho.  But the point is they are far, far more common in 2011 than even last year or 2009.  The largest lifed from the ladder was 90 cm and 14.4 lbs, but many others in this size range were seen.  I also know at least 10 anglers that hooked close to or over 20 each on the Credit this fall (Justin and myself included).  And to clarify, all in the regular open sections since we are not collecting from the sanctuary at all.  The 3 grilse Craig noted were not found at Streetsville.  They were found by CVC in early August 77 km from Lake Ontario.  One of them above 5 dams!  The other two above 3 dams.  CVC shocked roughly 700m of stream for these (thanks Jon), yet we have roughly 30 km of suitable summer habitat.  There may not have been thousands, but one hundred in the upper river by early August is very reasonable.  I also had two in the lake out of 5 trips.  Sure I had 20 chinooks, a couple coho and a few dozen bows too.  But that is the highest lake average I have had.  The key will be seeing these fish start to spawn and adapt.  As stated before, we are dealing with 20 years of hatchery inbreeding.  Yet the returning fish are sweet, chrome and strong.  Using the adults to build higher return rates and develop a Lake Ontario strain is what will move towards better return rates and a fishery that might make most anglers happy.  Allowing fish to access prime spawning grounds will also achieve this.  This is where NY is ahead of Ontario.  The have better resoruces and less red tape.  We have a lot of good people in MNR, but they are tied up in red tape.  The start of this article speaks to 3 years of wild Atlantic salmon in the Salmon River.  NY until last year was paying lip service to the program, stocking 30-50,000 low quality Atlantic yearlings into the Salmon River.  Thier strain is mainly Grand Lake I beleive.  The fish suprised all and started reproducing.  Now the USGS has re-tooled a small hatchery to collect and hold returning adult Atlantic salmon to the SR hatchery and use those eggs to raise and stock additional yearlings.  So for the first time since 1886 adult Atlantic salmon that survived Lake Ontario will be used to produce more hatchery fish rather than fish from another lake or ocean.  I would be willing to bet NY has higher returns by 2020 because of this.  And this is the one major thing I would like Ontario to change.  But to do this takes time, effort and a quarentine area at the MNR hatchery.  To address other issues:  Atlantic salmon are not replacing chinooks.  They are in addition too.  Secondly, MNR and NY cannot stock 500,000 more chinook, coho or steelhead into the lake over fears of ruining the predator-prey balance.  They can stock that many Atlantic's because they know there is a lower survival rate and it is not enough to mess with the balance.  And now they are dealing with proof the chinooks and coho are producing far more wild fish than most managers ever though possible.  In the end, as Louis noted, even if the fish never return, the funding brought forth by outside sources (not government) and matched funding has added far more funding the rehab and help our local rivers than ever before.  Even if someone hates Atlantic salmon they should be thankful the program is benefiting all the other species we have and enjoy.  As Aaron said, Rome was not built in a day.  NY lake fishing creel data also shows the highest lake catch and harvest of Atlantic salmon in the past two years.  Not a coincidence.  The present MNR program that was ramped up in 2006 has stocked about 3 million Atlantics in 6 years.  But over 50% have been in the past 2 years and are still in the streams as juveniles.  The new strains are just reaching maturity in the hatchery to produce eggs.  So this fall will be the first year MNR can produce a substancial amount of eggs from the two new strains for stocking fry in 2012 and yearlings in 2013 to contribute to the fishery in 2014-2017.  Will they be better than LaHave...who knows.  But LaHave fish are producing growing returns.  MNR has not been able to get other strains yet.  This is due to lack of places with surplus eggs, disease concerns/regulations and hatchery quarantine space.  It would be great to get our hands on Restigouche or Cascapedia salmon eggs.  But that will not happen unless we see continued and growing success and ANGLER SUPPORT!  It would be great to see anglers publically thank sponsors and staff for doing their best and trying.  Some do.  But far too many choose to trash the programs and this only hurts us all.  Why would any company donate or invest in a hornets nest like this.  CRAA has been refused grants several times in the past few years over this issue.  Why donate to a cause to get pissed on?  Far more productive to find the positive and build on it.  I for one would like my children to inherit more than I did, not less.  I could go on and on and on, but have much work to do and my tree stand is calling.  I have dozens of pics sent to me this fall, but no time to post.  Tightlines,  John"

637163,craigdritchie,2011-11-03 21:36:00,1586,"Headed to the airport and I don't have much time to reply to any of this, but I do want to clarify that Jon's chinook figure includes US plants (my Atlantic salmon numbers don't). It's also important to note that not all those fish were ever in the system at one time - they were spread over a 42 year span.  Bottom line is, however, that right now, and for the past several years, Ontario has stocked roughly the same number of chinook and Atlantic salmon each year (approx 500,000 fish). The half-million chinook produce a viable sport fishery, while the Atlantics do not. The truth hurts, but there it is.  No question Atlantic salmon add value in other ways, as John, Louis, Justin, Aaron and others have outlined. And I need to emphasize that I would be thrilled to see this program succeed. But so far, the results have not materialized and I still feel we need to do more to provide a balanced fishery. We cannot rely on the Atlantic salmon program as the future of fishing in Lake Ontario.  Vance is right on the money - there are way too many numbers in this conversation, and there is clearly no shortage of passion. Wouldn't it be great to focus all of this energy together and build a fishery we can all be proud of?"
637224,John Bacon,2011-11-03 23:51:00,3277," That would speed the process up; but there are other factors to consider.  Hatcheries who are willing to provide eggs may not be willing to part with their brood stock.  The MNR takes several samples during the development of the fish from the egg to adult stage. Long before a fish reaches adulthood, several of its syblings will have been tested for various deseases. If their syblings don't have the deseases then they probably don't either. This wouldn't be practical if you were starting with adults.  It is most likely against MNR policy to use adults to create a brood stock. There are valid reasons for these policies."

636843,Jon,2011-11-02 16:10:00,209,And an update from the Ontario side:  September OFAH Press Release   Jon
636885,craigdritchie,2011-11-02 19:10:00,1586,"Dr. Sal, I wouldn't get too excited just yet.  Per the September OFAH memo that Jon referenced, this August three Atlantic salmon were observed in the Credit River. Three. From a stocking of more than 500,000 fish each year.  The Credit River Anglers Association reports it recovered 49 Atlantic salmon at its Streetsville fishway in 2008, 75 fish in 2009 and perhaps a total of 200 fish in 2010. Those are returns from annual plants in the neighborhood of 500,000 fish. Over the past three years Ontario has stocked 1.5 million Atlantic salmon in Lake Ontario and to date, we've seen fewer than 400 return.  The fact is, we have stocked more than 5.5 million Atlantic salmon into Lake Ontario since 1986. Returns each year amount to a couple of dozen fish. Do you really call that a success story?  I don't.  It is especially disappointing when one considers what kind of fishery we would have on our hands if we stocked anywhere near the same number of steelhead, or coho. The great coho fishery off the Credit River in the 70s and 80s came from fewer fish than that, and it spawned a huge charter and tackle industry. Why don't we see similar results from all these Atlantic salmon plants?  People who defend the Atlantic salmon program say the lousy results are because the fish are stocked as tiny little fry. Well guess what - chinook are also stocked as tiny little fry, and look how they survive. We stock 500,000 Atlantics a year and yet most anglers have never even seen one. We stock the same number of chinook, and they're everywhere.  Continued success indeed.  I'm not trying to be nasty about it, or stir the pot here, but come on man. As taxpayers and anglers who buy licenses each year, we deserve better."
636892,myot,2011-11-02 19:48:00,131,"  Comming from a guy who fishes Lake Ontario hard from April through October I have personaly caught 12 Atlantics with 9 comming over the past two years. That is beyond sad seeing we stock 500,000 a year. As a side note we boated just under 300 Kings this year 55 Coho 135 Browns and 167 Steelhead and I'm sure none of these great fish get neer the finacial support that the all mighty Atlantic gets.   Dan"
636896,craigdritchie,2011-11-02 20:01:00,1586,"I need to correct an error I noticed in my previous post. In the sixth paragraph I wrote that we have stocked 500,000 Atlantics per year for the past 25 years. That's not right. For the first 18 years of the Atlantic salmon program, we stocked an average of 141,466 fish per year, not half a million. It's been 500,000 per year since though, and no matter how you slice it, 141,000 fish is still a LOT considering how few were ever caught."

636906,craigdritchie,2011-11-02 21:17:00,1586,a 14-inch Atlantic has almost certainly spent a year in the lake. They're pretty small when stocked.
636909,misfish,2011-11-02 21:37:00,29133,"  Was waiting for someone to bring Daryl into this. YADDA YADDA.  It is a shame that it,s not working."
636915,John Bacon,2011-11-02 22:27:00,3277,For most of the Atlantic stocking program the MNR have been stocking the Lehav strain; which are domesticated inbreds. They have now started stocking some new strains; hopefully these will be more successful.
636916,kemper,2011-11-02 22:30:00,2232," That would make sense, but I just got the feeling that it had been there its whole life. It was 20+km from the Lake, and would have needed to navigate a fairly large dam. It didn't make a lot of sense to me that a non-spawning fish would make that type of journey and be in the river in late May..."
636917,kemper,2011-11-02 22:31:00,2232,If I can dig up the picture I'll post it...but I have a sneaking suspicion that it is on my old blackberry that took a swim
636922,highdrifter,2011-11-02 22:55:00,2534," They're actually stocked as yearlings now.  Too early to tell if we'll get better returns but the numbers are going up..  The particular strain that we have now have might grow genetically stronger with every generation... And now that Streetsville is open during the earlier months, a self sustaining population is more and more likely..  They are sure are a sight to behold though.  I've seen larger fish for the first time this year and they're every bit as feisty as they say they are.  Who knows..  Chronzy might have a go at them eventually and have to eat some humble pie."
636926,esoxansteel,2011-11-02 23:10:00,1307,"  We already have enough 2 legged imbreds, now were stocking imbred fish as well, no wonder their not working"
636936,craigdritchie,2011-11-02 23:30:00,1586,"I don't mean any disrespect to John or Highdrifter, but I've been hearing the same excuses for 25 years. ""But now we're stocking XXXX strain. It's too early to tell, but it looks encouraging.""  We stock coho salmon and in 18 months, you know. Those little stockers return as 10 - 15 pound adults.  We stock rainbows or browns and in 18 months, you know. You have 6 to 10 pound fish all over the place.  We stock chinooks and in 18 months, you know. You have lots of 8 - 10 pound fish .... and a year later you have 20 to 25 pound adults stacked in the rivers like cordwood.  How many years do I have to keep hearing that with the Atlantics, it's still too early to tell?  MNR has been saying this since 1986."
636941,kemper,2011-11-02 23:39:00,2232," I did! No response... There are tons of very small ones up in the headwaters, but it certainly doesn't seem to be translating into any real #'s. That said, I have seen more this year than ever before, but I'm not holding my breath."
636947,John Bacon,2011-11-02 23:56:00,3277," Well the new strains have only been stocked in very recent years; within the last five years. If you have been hearing about new strains for 25 years then you have been misinformed. Prior to that the MNR stocked the same strain which never had proper genetic diversity to begin with, and has never been refreshed with wild stock (which needs to be done at least everty 10 years). How successful do you think the turkey re-introduction would have been if they had used inbred farm stock?"
636950,Gregoire,2011-11-03 00:19:00,1397,"I was out on Lake Ontario with a longtime guide this summer, and he brought up the fact that an increased emphasis on stocking atlantics may have a negative affect on the derby. Having said that, does anyone echo that sentiment. His reasoning was that a lot of people, especially those that go out on a charter, are attracted by the possibility of catching a 40 pound king. If you replace those kings with Atlantics, which I do not think will grow as large as the kings, then a lot of interest in the derby will be lost."
636951,John Bacon,2011-11-03 00:28:00,3277,"Yes, that is a valid concern. That is the main reason that many have pushed the MNR to stock the Restigouche strain of Atlantics which do have the potential to grow quite large."
636956,danjang,2011-11-03 00:45:00,148,"I know that this is a fishing forum and people's concerns here are that of the sport. But I'd like to bring up a point that doesn't get a lot of attention.  The Atlantic Salmon was a Lake Ontario native, a part of our natural heritage. I know that the original strain of fish is officially extinct, but the species still exists elsewhere. Now we as a species have done a lot to degrade the environment and this is an opportunity to correct it. Reintroduction of a lot of animals from all over the world are underway. Species that are almost identical can in fact differ enough genetically to be considered a distinct population (Cryptic species). Even though these cryptic species have gone extinct and genetic diversity has been lost, we still attempt to reintroduce them to their native habitats.  What my point is, if we give up trying to fix what we have broken what is the future going to entail for our children's children? Should we even try to save/restore our natural heritage or just let it be and end up having a bunch of non-indigenous species conquering our water because some fishermen are disgruntled over what kinds of fish they can catch?"
