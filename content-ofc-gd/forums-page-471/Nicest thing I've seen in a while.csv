Along comes this guy about my age pushing an older, probably mid 70's+ guy in a wheelchair with rod/reel and worms.  They get set up, the older chaps not catching much with worms, I strike up a little talk with the ""younger"" guy, he says ya he's my dad, have to get him out of the house now and then.  Nice to see some folk still take care of their parents and give them some time.  I left him my minnows and wished him the best."

637714,Fisherman,2011-11-06 00:31:00,7201,"Oh caught enough to make supper tomorrow night, threw back a bunch of little ones.  Tried the slip float today, they didn't like that, went to the sinker on bottom and a hook about 1 foot up, that was the answer.  Sat by the winch that lifts the masts off the sailboats."
