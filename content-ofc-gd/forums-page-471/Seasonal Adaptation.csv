On the way to an ATV trail this morning I came upon a pretty good accident, somebody tried to slide around the corner the hard way..upside down on the roof.  The roadway runs along a treeline of substantial height, so when the frost forms on the road, it stays for a while in the morning.  Therefore, pay attention if you can't pay for anything else, it's not the roads fault or Mother Nature, learn to read the road and slow down, you might get there a bit late..but you'll get there in one piece."
