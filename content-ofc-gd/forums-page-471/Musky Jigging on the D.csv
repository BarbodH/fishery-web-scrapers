637575,Cudz,2011-11-05 03:27:00,2652,Holy Crap Brandon! The only thing better than those Musky is your Moustache.  Movember came early for you. lol  Serious fish there.  I am in awe and jealous at the same time of your moustache but especially your fish
637576,WeedLine,2011-11-05 03:28:00,322,"You lucky dog, you. Great muskies. Must have been an amazing experience spending a couple days with those guys and all those fish. Thanks for the report and pics"
637578,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2011-11-05 03:34:00,535,"Gorgeous fish! Never tried jigging for musky, though my 2nd biggest came on a bulldawg that I let sink close to the bottom and popped up a couple of times and just felt dead weight until it started to move. Exciting feeling, gotta give jigging a try next year."
637598,outllaw,2011-11-05 10:52:00,1232,nice fish. definatly stressed. if the fight was 30 seconds how long was the photo-op.?. jons doing well for only a few years musky guiding.
637625,landry,2011-11-05 13:22:00,1005,"I guess there will be even more guys down there cutting each other off now! Nice fish though From what I hear Bondy is a great guy and he has been very friendly when I have seen him on the water. His reports on the internet surely have helped his business, but the number of muskie anglers has definitely increased as a result on the river. See all you guys there next weekend I guess. Landry"
637633,kickingfrog,2011-11-05 14:26:00,8333,"Hey Brandon, Gord Pyzer mentioned your pb successes while on the fan 590 this morning. Guess we have to believe you eh."
637639,d_paluch,2011-11-05 16:17:00,343,"There are fish in the pictures? All I see is a serious stash....              Seriously though amazing fish, I can only dream of fishing for musky. What a beautiful species"
637737,brandon,2011-11-06 01:21:00,857,thanks guys.  Sounds like i'll have to wait for this mornings Outdoor Journal radio show to be posted online so I can hear what Doc Pyzer says!
637742,msp,2011-11-06 01:39:00,1336,Gord Pyzer is the best ! So is two fifties in one day
637783,Bondy,2011-11-06 11:29:00,40,"Thanks guys. 2012 will be my 18th year guiding the Detroit and my 12th for musky and as Brandon will agree I've never seen such and exciting way to fish for them as the strikes are unreal. Gord and I talked alot about all kinds of things from fishing with the Lindners to ice fishing in the far north. That is one knowledgeable guy and one of the coolest down to earth guys we've met. Truly a Canadian legend. Brandon posted our musky jigging video on here earlier this year, but in case you missed it here is 10 minutes of instruction: Good fishing! Jon Bondy"
637837,S.M.05,2011-11-06 16:27:00,145,Jiggn up 2 musky @ fifty and over in one day......awesome.  Watched that video last year and thought jiggn for them would be crazy
637850,Squid,2011-11-06 17:33:00,1656,Nice fish Brandon!! I guess that I was at the wrong end of the lake on Friday
638028,Leecher,2011-11-07 13:57:00,7832,Absolutely phenomenal Congrats Brandon
638031,corvette1,2011-11-07 14:05:00,1765,awesome skis congrats on your pb
638182,Jds63,2011-11-07 21:25:00,1365,congrats ... those are giants for sure
638200,solopaddler,2011-11-07 22:29:00,8605,That is absolutely incredible. Wow.
638254,Djeep,2011-11-08 00:07:00,199,"Hey jon. You have probably heard of this, but some people believe there are 2 strains of muskie. The lacustrine strain, such as kawarthas fish, that do not exist with pike and this strain spawns once. There's also the great lakes strain of muskie that spawn twice I believe, and are known as the riverine strain. Pretty cool adaptations!"
638261,Bondy,2011-11-08 00:12:00,40,That is what Gord said if I remember correctly!
637366,brandon,2011-11-04 14:11:00,857,"As was mentioned in a previous post, I spent the last 2 days jigging for Musky with Bondy Baits on the Detroit River with Jon Bondy and Gord Pyzer...and it was awesome!  I think I learned more about fishing in those 2 days then the rest of my life combined.  And to top it all off, we all got into some good fish!  Wednesday was by far our best day for numbers, going 8 for 11.  Two 48""s were the biggest fish of the day and the rest were all lower to mid 40's.  Gord and Jon had the hot hands that day and I ended up mostly being the net guy, which is an honour in itself.  Here's my only fish from wednesday...   Detroit River Musky by bbroderick86, on Flickr  Now yesterday was a different story...  About an hour into the morning Gord hooked a mid 40""er that got off at the surface....then it got quiet for a couple hours.  Thankfully this quiet time didn't last long.  I all of a sudden went from the net guy to the ""i have no strength left in my arms"" guy.  Within an hour I had tied my previous best musky (a 48"" caught last fall with Bondy) and beat my personal best 2 more times....in an HOUR!  Here's my first fish of the day - a fat 51.5"" that absolutely slammed my bait.  It's incredible setting the hook into what feels like a snag at first.  And even more incredible is that we got this fish in the boat...when it came up it was only hooked by one prong of one treble hook...which broke off...BEFORE IT WAS IN THE NET!  the hook snapped off and ended up in the net and I'm not sure why this fish didn't just swim back down to the bottom but it flopped around on the surface and Jon was able to get the net under it.  This was when i laid down on the bow for a bit to let my heart slow down lol   New PB Musky! by bbroderick86, on Flickr  After this fish was photographed and released, I decided to update my Facebook status...gotta rub it in a bit right? lol On the next pass I hook into another good fish - the 48"".  After this fish was released Gord asked me if I was going to update my Facebook status again.  I told him I wanted to wait and do it after one more pass....and that's when I hooked my 2nd 50""+ fish of the day!  Here's a shot of it - 50""!   50"" Musky! by bbroderick86, on Flickr  I'm not sure what it was that day but we were all using the same jigs in the same boat and I got the only 3 fish.  Hot colours for both days were Black/Orange Flake and Pearl.  By far the best 2 days of fishing of my life.  thanks for reading!"
637368,Handlebarz,2011-11-04 14:14:00,3790,Awesome report Brandon congrats that 51 sure looks stressed out I would guess that's why she stuck around? Gotta love the DR
637369,NAW,2011-11-04 14:16:00,4022,Wow eh.  Great time on the water.  Amazing colour in the fish.  Congrets on the PB.
637370,brandon,2011-11-04 14:17:00,857,"Actually Mike we were using heavy rods with 80#braid and 200lb leaders with the drag tightened as much as it goes....she was in the boat in 30 seconds.  I don't think she knew she was free... at that point.  But she, along with all the others, swam away to be caught again!"
637372,Handlebarz,2011-11-04 14:23:00,3790,I did not mean she was stressed from the fight as we get a lot of them on LSC like that as you know.  I have wondered why it is that there are many that come up like that is there still VHS in them or something else as its not a water temp thing this time of year. most seem to have bleeding tail fins also. I dont notice it in the clear musky from tea stained waters
637373,I'mHooked,2011-11-04 14:23:00,525,"Absolutely INCREDIBLE! Those are some of the nicest looking, and BIG fish I have seen!  Congratulations!"
637378,mike rousseau,2011-11-04 14:41:00,4661,i never get the bleeding fins either...  even when we get a big girl by accident on walleye gear...  i think it has to do with a pre existing condition...like you mentioned mike...VHS? maybe...   nice job on the 2 x 50s... havent done that yet myself...
637382,danc,2011-11-04 14:49:00,4677,Pretty awesome Brandon. Must have been a real treat fishing with those guys. Congrats Bud.
637383,scugpg,2011-11-04 14:52:00,1373,Great job you guys? Jigging for them must be a blast.  Killer stache btw!
637387,manitoubass2,2011-11-04 15:07:00,11391,"When you say ""jigging for musky"", what type of jigs are you talking about? Bass style jigs or round head jigs???  Great fish, 2 50's in a day is incredible!  I'm surprised you got Gord off LOTW, hes was probably withdrawing, lol"
637388,brandon,2011-11-04 15:12:00,857,we were jigging with Bondy Baits.  Pearl and Black/Orage Flake were the best producing colours over the 2 days
637394,manitoubass2,2011-11-04 15:23:00,11391,"  Ahhh, I see. Thank you. I'm clueless when it comes to musky, so please forgive my ignorance"
637395,addy79,2011-11-04 15:25:00,573,"Nice work Brandon!  Your boat was on fire Wednesday! I saw you guys net quite a few on your milk run. Bondy bait is my new fav for sure. Jigging for these fish is AWESOME! Iâ€™m not sure what's more tiring, bouncing Bondy's off the bottom for hours, or battling giant fish for seconds at a time."
637398,bucktail,2011-11-04 15:32:00,1857,One word.............WOW!
637407,mistaredone,2011-11-04 16:02:00,913,"Happy for you about the pbs, not happy now I gotta go buy 2 more musky baits.  Congrats!"
637412,SirWhite,2011-11-04 16:27:00,210,"Bondy baits, jigging for Muskie? Post pics of bait please Nice fish by the way! Huge! Do our Muskie's bleed from their fins?  I'm in shock I think"
637420,mpt,2011-11-04 16:50:00,158,Nice fish and post.
637421,Joey,2011-11-04 16:50:00,9122,Excellent Fish Brandon.  That is interesting about the stress colouring on the big gal tho.  congrats bud
637424,Whitemikeca,2011-11-04 16:54:00,138,WOW.  Amazing.  Congrats on the PB!  I can't wait to get back down there.  And thanks again for the photos of my fish!
637425,Lunkerhunter,2011-11-04 16:56:00,455,awesome pics man! i was out with bondy last weekend. great guy and really knows his stuff. His baits are very impressive and produce fish! good to see you guys got into them while pyzer was there as well.  cheers
637434,fishindevil,2011-11-04 17:28:00,6254,"congrats guys !!! awesome 50' ski >>!!!!  gord will be writing about that in a few days for sure,....cheers"
637458,Brettiop,2011-11-04 19:46:00,279, Awesome fish! you were certainly in good company with those two on the boat....    Its like sometimes people forget to use the internet! lol  All you need to know on the bait right here!  http://bondybaitcompany.com/  
637472,esoxansteel,2011-11-04 20:11:00,1307,"I hope Jons melting rubber as we speak, cause Bondy Baits will be flying off the shelves, why waste money going to a gym to workout, buy some Bondys and go jigging, youll have arms like popeye in no time, and you wont have to eat spinach"
637533,SirWhite,2011-11-04 23:59:00,210,   This is the internet  lol  Thanks for the info Definitely gonna try it soon.
637558,rocheleauc,2011-11-05 01:36:00,205,"Awesome tanks, beautiful fish.  Thanks for the report."
