637860,Adam Delves,2011-11-06 18:37:00,28,Do walleye ever come into the marina?  Was at the perch derby on Saturday and saw a few guys pull a couple perch (the bite just not on) I believe a bass or two and there were some nice size browns swimming around. Just thought I'd ask and see if anyone has some idea.
