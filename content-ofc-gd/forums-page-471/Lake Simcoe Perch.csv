637990,vince.bornais,2011-11-07 11:38:00,50,If you're going to Kempenfelt Bay in Barrie you may have a hard time finding them. The city of Barrie has been dredging the waterfront. I was out 2 Fridays ago and my usual spot was completely devoid of weeds. I had to fish over by the Tiffin launch to find weeds & fish. That smell from the run-off canal there adds to the experience as well.
637991,Skipper D,2011-11-07 11:46:00,1970,"Not good ..... if it was going to stay nice all this week , i was kinda thinking i might go for one last time as i still have one boat not put away yet ."
637992,Rizzo,2011-11-07 11:48:00,4754, mmmm now there's some good eatin
637994,vince.bornais,2011-11-07 11:51:00,50,You could probably still go. I would try the North or South side of the bay. Look for weeds.
637995,Skipper D,2011-11-07 11:54:00,1970, LOL .......... my question remains tho ?

638095,bassfanatic25,2011-11-07 16:17:00,36,Fish the south side of Georgina Island in 9-12 feet of water.  Lots of perch there.  Big ones too.  You can launch in the Pefferlaw River or Sibbalds Point Provincial Park.  They are the closest launch ramps.  Good Luck.
