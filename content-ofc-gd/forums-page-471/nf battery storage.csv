638066,Fisherman,2011-11-07 15:07:00,7201,I'll bet you still do 3000 mile oil changes...
638068,Billy Bob,2011-11-07 15:11:00,5865, TWO Thousand....don't you remember the Kendall Oil logo with the Two Fingers held out for every 2 thousand miles.
638079,Fisherman,2011-11-07 15:20:00,7201,"No, no, no, that's a boy scout salute."
638085,Billy Bob,2011-11-07 15:39:00,5865, When I was younger I always found the Girl Scouts much more interesting....
638087,Roy,2011-11-07 15:48:00,13728,"Few people know that in the land of shadow puppets, shining a bright light on your hand while doing the Kendall salute will cause a rabbit to appear on your wall."
638239,John Bacon,2011-11-07 23:39:00,3277," However, if a battery leaks it can damage a concrete floor. Storing the batteries on a piece of wood or rubber matt is a good idea because it can protect your floor from the battery."
638244,Fisherman,2011-11-07 23:49:00,7201,"However, if you have an earthquake, your house and basement might tilt and then your piece of wood or rubber mat will be totally useless.  If you're that worried, go buy some battery boxes."
638252,Skipper D,2011-11-08 00:06:00,1970,"Well heres how i see it now ....... all the yonge guys store your batterys on the cement floor , and all the old guys store your batterys on a piece of wood , that way no one will have any trouble . Lew , once they went dead they would'nt take a charge ."
638256,Terry,2011-11-08 00:08:00,14456,"and the wood and rubber could burn, so putting them on the floor seems better"
638396,Billy Bob,2011-11-08 11:51:00,5865,Boat batteries belong in boats....
638405,Rizzo,2011-11-08 12:59:00,4754, amen...unless you have a cement boat
638419,bubbles,2011-11-08 13:51:00,591, Kinda like keeping them off the cement floor.
637908,archer379,2011-11-06 23:41:00,277,Is it safe to store 7 batteries 4 deep cycle and 3 starting batteries in my basement over the winter the only place i really have is in the room with the breaker panel?
637911,Rizzo,2011-11-06 23:53:00,4754,"I leave all mine out in the garage, just charge em up once in a while. I don't know enough about batteries to think that would be unsafe"
637914,BillM,2011-11-07 00:02:00,17367,"Why not?  We store all ours in a closet in the basement, never an issue."
637918,mercman,2011-11-07 00:09:00,7054,"Yup, just check em every few weeks. Ya might want to make you and your familly some tinfoil hats, just in case the extra power attracts Mr. Grey."
637924,bigbuck,2011-11-07 01:02:00,2449,That's fine. Make sure they are charged and you should be fine.
637944,motion,2011-11-07 01:47:00,403,You're ok to store them as long as you don't plan on charging them in the basement. Charging a battery can omit hydrogen gas that is higly flamible. I had a battery charging in my RV once that kept setting of my CO detector. Won't be doing that again.
637971,Billy Bob,2011-11-07 09:53:00,5865,I haven't remove my boat batteries (2) in about 10-12 years....I just make sure the onboard charger is plugged in.
637976,Skipper D,2011-11-07 10:28:00,1970,"Make sure not to leave them on cement floor , keep them up on some thing like a board , thick rubber mat , ect ."
637977,Jer,2011-11-07 10:31:00,1426,   Why not?
637978,Skipper D,2011-11-07 10:40:00,1970,  It tends to kill them flat and most time after they will never take a charge again .
637982,Jer,2011-11-07 11:04:00,1426,"   Old wive's tale that doesn't pertian to today's plastic encased batteries. More of a concern would be over-filling, over-charging or leakage that would eat a nice hole in your concrete."
637988,Skipper D,2011-11-07 11:16:00,1970,"  Don't know Jer if its a wise tale or not . I never questioned it when i was told by a mechanic years ago not to do it , did forget a few times and paid the price . One things for certain , you'll never see them on the floor where you buy them ."
637993,Rizzo,2011-11-07 11:51:00,4754,apparently for old style batteries this concrete floor thing was true but not any longer
637998,lew,2011-11-07 12:06:00,12766, Just curious as to what problems you had with leaving your batteries on a cement floor Skipper ??
638000,Rizzo,2011-11-07 12:09:00,4754, I have
638001,Roy,2011-11-07 12:19:00,13728,"That is a very old myth. It was not recommended in the early 1900s. Read about it. Learn. Google ""battery cement floor"" and you'll have put another scary thing out of your life."
638003,Billy Bob,2011-11-07 12:21:00,5865,"Bottom line I tend to agree with Skipper......what's so hard about putting a battery on a piece of scrap wood.  But as I have said before....if you have a onboard charger just plug it in and forget it....don't hear about anyone removing their truck batteries in the winter, do you ?"
638008,mercman,2011-11-07 12:41:00,7054,"  And right below that, the Boogie Man theory is shot to heck too"
638010,bobkayla,2011-11-07 12:47:00,148,"leave em in the boat,,,why do any extra work than you to,just keep them charged,have never taken them out and never had a problem,,,they are heavy!!!"
638012,Fishnwire,2011-11-07 12:57:00,983,"You can store batteries that aren't being charged in your basement with no real worries regarding safety.  Make sure nothing conductive can come in contact with the terminals, and checking them every now and then to make sure they're not leaking/bulging (which is unlikely) isn't a bad idea.  About the worst thing you can do (as far as the life of the battery goes) is to leave it in a state of discharge for any real length of time.  Charge them up to 100% before you put them away.  I also like to top mine off once or twice over the off season...but it's only really necessary with my older batteries that don't hold a charge as well.  Doing that in an unventilated space is something to avoid."
638042,bigbuck,2011-11-07 14:31:00,2449,"Don't go killing the boogey man!! I put my Deep Cycles on a couple of scrap 2x4's in the garage after they have been charged up. I also charge them a couple of times over the winter to make sure they don't freeze. A fully charged battery won't freeze, a discharged battery will."
638047,Roy,2011-11-07 14:44:00,13728,"I take the batteries out of the boat and bring them inside. I know I don't have to, I just do. I also keep the batteries on a cart but only because it's easier to move them around, It has nothing to do with not wanting them on a concrete floor. The cart holds my 4 batteries and a charger."
638052,lew,2011-11-07 14:49:00,12766,
638056,Roy,2011-11-07 14:56:00,13728, Ed zachary!
638060,Billy Bob,2011-11-07 15:01:00,5865, SO....now you believe everything you read on the internet....
