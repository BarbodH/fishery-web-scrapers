It was a reoccurring theme this weekend as Headhunter got what he believes would be his PB pike on Sunday. Nice to know my guiding/boat control is in tune for my guests, I just need to figure out how to put more/bigger/any fish in the boat myself."

638454,ccmtcanada,2011-11-08 16:04:00,7971, Mike...no need for an apology!!  Seriously...it's fine!
637715,ccmtcanada,2011-11-06 00:32:00,7971,"Fishnsled and I had planned a while ago to reserve this day to go hunt down some fall muskies.  I have not been able to break the 40"" mark when it came to any fish...and I was hoping to break that today.  It was a cold morning...with a skim of ice at the boat launch.  Good thing there wasn't any wind!  We launched just after 8am and headed towards our first spot.  As we neared it, we noticed a hunter hunkered down right where we wanted to fish...so we decided that they guy with a gun wins...LOL.  Off we went to spot number two...the wind freezing our faces off!  We began working an area and just we got near the end, I cast out my suick and begin working it back to the boat.  I was pausing the retrieve after long sweeps, and as soon as I began to bring it forward again I feel a hit!  A fish took a swipe at it and missed, so I let the bait stay there for a few seconds and began my retrieve again.  The fish smacked it hard and I set the hook!  It went crazy for about 5 seconds before I was able to get it under control.  I brought it to the side of the boat and knew I had a chance at breaking my previous PB Muskie of 39.5"".  This fish will get MUCH bigger...it had a HUGE head and was just beginning to bulk up.  Quick measure put it at 41.5""...a new PB!  I know it's not a trophy fish...but it feels good break that 40"" barrier...now need to get a 50! LOL   A little while later, as Fishnsled says ""we're entering a hot spot right here"".  Almost immediately he says ""look...here's a follow!""  A few minutes later he sets the hook and a little muskie shoots out of the water!  It wasn't a big one, but it sure was exciting!   The bite turned off after that...but the temperature warmed up some and we had a great day on the water...lots of laughs and good times.  Off to fish for Walleye tomorrow on Sturgeon Lake with Big Cliff...that promises to be a great time...fish or no fish!"
637719,mercman,2011-11-06 00:43:00,7054,"Musky !!!! Love those toothy buggers.I hope to do more hunting for them before ice in, and next year too. Congrats on your PB"
637723,Rizzo,2011-11-06 00:46:00,4754,nice looking fish! Can't believe there was a skim of ice already. I'm hoping to get out once or twice more myself

637779,Handlebarz,2011-11-06 10:28:00,3790,nice going on the PB cliff just keep chucking them baits and a 50 will find them.  Just out of curiosity what time were the fish turned on at?  When we were out they turned on fast at 12:30  we had 2 and another bat in the same are also had 2 by 1pm they were done as we stuck it out until 1:30 with out a sniff I sent a couple buddies over there and they got 2 just before and after moon rise.
