There was not much action where we were so we headed east on the lake over to another spot I like and sure enough 15 min in Jade landed her first of the day about 30"" heck she even thought it was to small for a pic. I just set the lines and one of them went off I got to see the fish it was a fat mid 40's fish that broke the 50lbs PP it was frayed so I think I have a bad guide on that rod I will look at it later. we were heading back to the launch and made one more turn and she landed this one what a great day with my bast fishing partner.
