There's still a bit of time left to get out for some giant smallies and I may get out once or twice more but with a very demanding schedule coming up, my season is pretty much done.  As always, I have put together a nice recap of my season. I've added a bunch of good videos we took at the bottom of the page for those interested. Thanks for reading!  Ice Fishing  I had another very successful ice fishing season.  The ice came a little later this year so we missed some early action, but only about a week and a half of it.  On Lake Simcoe, the shallower areas always freeze first and thats usually when I go for my perch fishing.  Love me a good perch fry! Quality perch were much deeper this year and we found our better schools in 38-54 feet of water and even as deep as 66ft.  Caught perch as deep as 101 but no quality or quantity in those depths.  Fishing the deeper water we managed some bonus lake trout and whitefish on occasion.    When the main lake finally freezes, my attention turns to lake trout and whitefish only... unless i need some more perch in my belly hahaha.  This year we found lakers shallower in the 70-80 foot range, it had been 95-105 the previous winter.  Our best baits this year were small spoons, tubes and a new swimbait called the X-Zone Swammer which was just deadly on a darter head jig. We release the majority of our fish, though I do keep on a pretty hard fish diet in the winter months.             Once our ice season closes in March comes our pike and musky seasons.  I dont do much musky fishing, though I like to mix in a little bit.  We found our best fish this year in super shallow water from 2 to 5 feet.  I think my deepest pike all season was out of 12 feet of water.  Flukes and jerkbaits took the majority but got a couple on a shallow invader as well.        By the end of June, bass fishing takes over.  It is truly my passion and I try to get out as much as I can.  I had an excellent season with the majority of my luck coming by pitching small 5/16oz jigs and dropshotting another X-Zone bait called the Slammer.
