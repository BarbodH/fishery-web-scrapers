638469,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 16:57:00,4661,just wondering if anybody can tell me the aprox line diameter of of leadcore line...  lets say 18 or 27lb kerplunk  i tried finding this info online... but no luck  im looking for the mono size equivelent or actual diameter...  im looking for a ballpark here...  like is 18 or 27lb close to 10lb-20lb-30lb-40lb-50lb mono  thnx trollers
638475,Headhunter,2011-11-08 17:08:00,5703,"Just a guess here, but, my 27lb l/c is about the same size as 30lb mono.... HH PS... I gotta do a pictorial of connecting l/c to a mono or floro leader... I've been using the super glue method for years and it works great... and no knotts and far easier to reel in throught the eyelets as well as the trolling reel."
638476,myot,2011-11-08 17:09:00,131,Its most likly closest to 50 or 60lbs mono a 45 size real hold 10 colours and 280 yards of 50lbs braid backing with a 30' 20lbs floro leader just about perfectly  Dan
638483,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 18:01:00,4661,  why do you need 840 feet of backing?  isnt that a bit much?
638484,Roy,2011-11-08 18:02:00,13728,"Standard lead core, TUF-Line for example in 27lb test is equivalent to 25 lb test mono, has a break strength of 31lbs and diameter is .045"" or 1.145mm.  edited: oops, that would be strength equivalent. Diameter on 25lb mono is approx. .020"""
638488,Roy,2011-11-08 18:13:00,13728,".045"" diameter mono is about 130lb test."
638489,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 18:15:00,4661,  you had me confused...  so leadcore is close to mono of the same strength then...  or 130lb mono?
638492,Roy,2011-11-08 18:21:00,13728,Not in the same diameters they aren't.
638493,GBW,2011-11-08 18:22:00,8460,this chart should help...  http://www.tuf-line.com/products_Specialty-Lines_15.html
638494,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 18:24:00,4661,  wow...  thats thick...
638495,Headhunter,2011-11-08 18:27:00,5703,Just curious as to why the question... are you planning on filling a reel and wondering about it's capacity with l/c? HH
638497,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 18:36:00,4661,  yup...  what reels do you guys use for leadcore...   i was even looking at saltwater reels... and most of them dont have the capacity for leadcore...
638498,GBW,2011-11-08 18:41:00,8460,This may help too.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7SUJ_bcYJU
638501,myot,2011-11-08 18:46:00,131,   I use my leadcore set ups for multi species use Salmon in the spring and summer and Walleye a few times each spring and lots in the fall I just change the leaders out. I like using a larger real for Leadcore simply for the power that a larger real provides a 45 size real can crank in a 10 colour with little to no effort go any smaller and you must pump the core in and its a reel bugger with a big fish on  Dan
638502,fishindevil,2011-11-08 18:47:00,6254,"i use okuma convector reels,most have 7 colors,i also have a large penn with 10 colors of 18lb,it depends how many colors you want on,that determins how much backing...i think my okuma reels are the 27 series???"
638504,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 18:51:00,4661,  according to my calculations a size 45 okuma wont even fit the 100 yards of lead core let alone the backing and leader....  the okuma 45 will only hold 85yds of core...  if core diameter is .045
638505,myot,2011-11-08 18:57:00,131,  I have 2 Okuma clairions with 10 colours of 27lbs sufix leadcore and 280yards of 50lbs sufix performance braid both reels work perfectly and I could probbly fit the extra 20 yards of backing if need be  Dan
638506,Harrison,2011-11-08 18:57:00,2202, Most likey 45's Shawn.  The Okuma Convector and Clairon 45's are very popular lead core reels.
638508,fishindevil,2011-11-08 19:06:00,6254,"sorry harrison you are right they are 45 series reels sorry about that...i have so many i cant keep track,i was thinking about diawa reels but those convectors do an awesome job holding the leadcore mike..."
638515,Headhunter,2011-11-08 19:30:00,5703,"I have the Okuma Convector reel (piece of junk that it is...) loaded with five colours of lead core, 50 ft of floro leader and close to 100 yds of 30lb mono backing. It gets pretty darn close to maxing out the reels capacity, but it works. I use this as by far, I'm trolling for Pickereyes and 5 colours is more than enough to get my baits down, but still keep me out of the kill zone. You may find that 5 colours is not enough for salmon or trout, in which case I have added a snap weight where the core and the backing attach. Seemed to do the trick alright. HH"
638561,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 22:36:00,4661,  how deep do you consider the kill zone.....?  i fish shallow water mostly.... so this kill zone is kinda new to me...
638564,Roy,2011-11-08 22:54:00,13728,Deeper than 40'= DOA.
638568,Terry,2011-11-08 23:04:00,14456,35 ft is what I consider the kill zone
638576,mike rousseau,2011-11-08 23:25:00,4661,so if im running cranks that dive 20-30 feet...  and core runs about 5 feet per color...  and the kill zone is say 40 feet...  i only need 2-4 colors of core... at the most...   right?
638666,mike rousseau,2011-11-09 03:00:00,4661,I ended up with a 50 foot leader... 5 colors... Then plenty of backing on my accudepth 27  I wouldn't wanna chase salmon with this set up...  But it should be fine for wet socks....
