637601,Familyfisherman,2011-11-05 11:32:00,188,"Interesting hearing everyone's perspective.  In my opinion success in ice fishing is very dependant on your rod/reel...people always try to cheap out in this area -- not wise.  What do you plan to fish for?  This totally dictates what you should be getting...  For example -- fishing for lake trout, you'll need a medium/heavy rod - 32 inches, 10lb braid, and a very good drag on your reel.  Fishing for specs, 28 in med rod, 8lb braid.  Perch, very light action rod, 2-4lb braid, etc...make sense?  If you're walking into lakes you'll need a sled for sure.  Forget the hut...good ice fisherman move constantly.  Turn your back to the wind and dress warm.  You'll need a fish finder for sure!  Absolutely critical...you can't catch what isn't there, and you must know depths and structure.  Forget the hand auger, get a gas auger -- best money you'll spend other than the fish finder.  With the hand auger you sweat, then you get cold...trust me on that.  Your list should be ammended to: warm clothing/boats/gloves power auger fish finder quality rod/reel with braided line and flouro leaders skimmer sled rope, picks, spud bar  As someone else said, go with a friend the first few times so you're sure you like it.  Beats selling everything half off if you find out you don't.  Ice fishing is all about location and technique.  Try to go with someone who knows...you'll catch fish and have fun.  Just walking onto some lake with no idea is almost a guaranteed failure and no fun at all imo...  Good luck!"
637607,Rod Caster,2011-11-05 12:03:00,5784,"Nipissing 2012 Hardwater G2G....'nough said. Hopefully TJ will be there again this year. I highly recomment the 2hr drive for this event. More details will be posted as it approaches.  We should definitly try McNab this winter, we'll have a fire on shore and cook up some smokies.... you and me both have a vendetta on that lake, don't we?   On lakes that are less travelled, like some have mentioned I'll pop a hole every 10-15 feet to ensure it's safe. There is a 100% chance I'll be up your way this winter, so we'll make some plans once the ice is thick.  DanC said it best, keep it simple and warm and your good to go. In my opinion, having to organize, maintain and haul a large amount of gear actually makes you less likely to hit the ice.     "
637612,Rizzo,2011-11-05 12:21:00,4754,"for years I fished like DanC...auger, spool of line/leaders/hooks, scooper and some bait. The odd fire on the ice. Simple as that and minimal investment. Its only been the last year I've added some comforts...portable hut, heater. Fishing can definitely be enjoyable when you're roughing it....but now I'm old and want to stay warm"
637617,manitoubass2,2011-11-05 12:38:00,11391,"Of course everyone has their preferences Dana, so you'll have to figure some of this out on your own through trials/experience.  I have a nice ice shack, seats 5 comfortably. And I still prefer to be outside of the shack, drilling holes by hand. I only use my shack about 10 times per season, and I go out almost everyday when the ice is in. The shack gets my preference though for night fishing, or when I have company.  If you buy a hand auger, always keep spare blades. And a towel to remove the ice/water from the blades after drilling a hole. And be careful around the blades!!!!! I've seen some gnarly cuts by people getting too cozy and not paying attention to what their doing.  Ice fishing is alot of fun. I'm sure if you get out there and do good, you'll be addicted. There is something about a successful ice fishing trip, baring the elements, thats just feels really awesome!"
637621,ckrb2007,2011-11-05 13:09:00,449,"I agree with FamilyFisherman and others when they say go out with friends a few times.....if not for an entire season on the ice. Buy yourself a good rod/reel and some warm clothes and head out with buddies that have the proper gear. Learn the lakes, techniques and tricks and then decide if you really want to invest in the sport. I started off like everyone else here....walking out, sitting in the elements,no fish finder, getting skunked.(I know some of you still do this) hahaha. Then moved into a pop-up hut with a fish finder catching a few now and again. Now I have 2 flip-over style huts, gas auger, good fish finder, heater, atv and totally enjoy heading out with buddies that are in your situation Dana. Nothing like seeing someone new to ice fishing hook into a nice laker or whitey. Makes it all worth-while.  Have fun and don't break the bank in your first season.......wait til the next hardwater season to do that!!!  Cheers, Colin"
637631,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-05 14:09:00,2582,Best advice I can give with regards to a Manual auger Dana. Get a strikemaster lazer or a Fin bore lll. They have a curved blade...this is the key. The curved style blades cut a lot better/easier then the swede bore and other straight bladed augers...and I do mean alot better. You can't believe the difference. It is the only thing besides good clothing I would never cheap out on.
637640,adolson,2011-11-05 16:33:00,783,"Yeah. I'll buy that new. Never tried it second-hand, but something tells me it'd be a pretty crappy experience.  Oh dude, you know I'll be there. As long as it doesn't conflict with anything more important on my schedule that can't be adjusted (wife's birthday is early next year, for example), which I'm sure it won't. And of course, as long as the ice is thick enough to hold me.  McNab is definitely on my hit-list. I'd love, love, LOVE to hit #51 but somehow I doubt they plow the roads that far... I bet the snowplow would bottom out on some of that road, haha. Do they plow into #25? In any case, I'm down for some adventures.  Thanks! This is exactly the thing I was hoping to learn through this thread. I'm definitely going to go manual. I don't mind doing the work, and I understand about getting sweaty. I'm willing to risk that. Besides, I've seen that most of them can be adapted to a high-torque cordless drill if I really want to go powered some day, which I don't plan to, but the option would likely be there.  Makes sense, yes, but honestly seems unnecessary. I only use one rod in the summer, and I have caught bass, pike, walleye, brook trout, perch, rock bass... Yet I know some people have a different rod for frogging, a different rod for jigging, a different rod for panfish, a different rod for this and a different rod for that. I think somewhere in the middle - at least to get me started - is what I'll do. Like others have said, a rod isn't even necessary, I just think I prefer it at this point. And I've heard too many horror stories about braid icing up for me to want to use it, especially if I  I have one, and apparently it can be used for ice fishing. I think it lies to me in summer fishing though, because it was marking tons of fish in Liberty Lake. It's really old and a bit beastly, though. I'd like a better one that I could use for my canoe and for ice fishing, but I won't have the money to drop like $300+ on that for a while. If there's a good model that's cheaper, I could put it on my Christmas list. But I kinda want one with maps and stuff, so it seems like a long-term purchase, to me. I could tote my current one around with me, but I have ideas of where I want to try already.  I've been with people who have decades of success, and still we caught nothing, but yes, I hear the advice and I get it. The only problem I have is finding people within an hour's drive to actually go with when I get that urge on a weeknight after work, or with last-minute notice on a weekend, for example. There are none on this forum it seems, and the people I've fished with that live near me are very unreliable and wishy-washy about it. That being said, I plan to go to North Bay with Rod Caster and Nipfisher and whoever else is there, and I also have tentative plans with my uncle and my wife's uncle to go to their favorite spots on Lake Temagami and I'm not sure where else.  I'm going to go, and at some point I'll catch something, and then I'm going to be addicted - this is how it's going to go, I'm sure. I could be wrong, but I know myself fairly well. I'm not really *too* concerned about ending up hating ice fishing at the end of this season. And I guess that will put an end to my joking around about it, too."
637641,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-05 16:54:00,10439," That's why you wear 8 layers of clothing, so you can always sacrifice a shirt if needed."
637770,dhickey,2011-11-06 05:40:00,1038,Hey Dana. Ice fishing is not about catching fish evey time you go out.It becomes an obsession a labour of love.The thrill/rush can be insain and thats what keeps me going back for the past 35 yrs.I am 44.  More importantly is that you want to try ice fishing.  The best advice I could give you is spend your money on clothing first so that you are prepared to go out with guys that can show you a thing or two over the course of a day of looking for fish. This way you will stay warm/dry and comfortable and not be that guy that brings the day to a misserable end.  Buy a used float suit(mustang 100$) get good boots with lots of rubber under your feet(1/2 inch min) and be prepared to spend 120$ on 2 pairs of gloves/mitts.As for snow suits the price range can get stupid I would sudgest getting one from TSC Edco snow siutes are made buy Choko and the value is great I bought one 5 yrs ago for 200$ awesum.(BLACK snow suits are the only way to go on ice or snow) Your float suit must be big enough to fit over your snow suit because if you live 6 hrs north of Simcoe its freaking COLD and I have never had a problem with this set up -20-30 good to go.(very versitile)-40 I would be  carefull .  Oh ya a dry towel for your hands is invaluble....  About 700$ to be comfortable without a hut about 1200$ with a hut. Start with the clothing.  Good luck. Saltydawg.
637806,phatpelkey,2011-11-06 13:51:00,78,"i think if your going to buy a new auger buy a nils master auger, best there is out there, cuts like butter, a bit pricey but worth it"
637807,GBW,2011-11-06 13:51:00,8460,"ok, not reading any of page 2 yet but here's an idea for you Dana.  got an old tent?  know anyone with one that they are willing to give you free and not want it back?  if so use it and cut a hole in the base to fish out of.  where you need strings use the snow to keep in in place."
637859,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-06 18:35:00,0,"  i agree with danc.  i STILL don't have an ice hut and i likely spend more days on the ice than many on this forum.  often, because i'm backpacking i don't carry ANY rods because all they do is freeze up unless you are in a hut and they are just added weight.  a few spools of line with a birch gad and a bell is often what i'm using for a still line!  as far as an auger goes, i use a 6.  i've pulled some decent sized fish through it.  i also catch more fish because i can drill a bunch of holes every day instead of just drilling 2 and being exhausted like many with an 8 inch.  i recommend the fin bore over the swede bore as it takes no effort to drill a 6 inch fin bore hole."
637863,Terry,2011-11-06 19:26:00,14456,"real men can take the cold  young men  medicated men and men who work outside in - 40 deg temp are used to being in -40 temps so playing in -40 is nothing  but for someone who works in a office all day long. well....they are not impressed by the "" give me a lumberjack shirt plastic bags for boots and some rope and a safety pin and I can fish all day in -40.......   try sitting in a office all day straining your eyes on a computer...worried if the air conditioning will work..now that's manly   ...LOL  never mind..."
637869,Stef,2011-11-06 19:55:00,63,"Save your money and go light as has been suggested.  Five gallon pail to sit on, carry some minnows out in and fish you catch back.  Dollar store sells some large spoons with holes in 'em to clear slush and ice chips out of the hole for a buck.  An auger with the curved blades (Fin bore style) cuts best as has been mentioned already.  Warm clothes with a hood (if you don't have a floater suit nothing wrong with a lifejacket over your clothes early season) and boots, back to wind.  Don't go to far out from the vehicle for your first couple of outings and a compass is a real good idea.  You can make some ice picks from two large nails and some cord and foam/wood.  A kids toboggan (fairly long) with some milk crates fastened makes a good sled to haul some stuff and a platform you can haul across a break and help you get out should you get on some thin ice.  After you gain some experience you'll know what else you want/need....  "
637877,Sinker,2011-11-06 20:35:00,8692,"I'm also in the keep it simple group....although I do have a 1 man portable hut/graph/ number of rods. I just use my hut as a sled to haul my gear. I've never actually fished from the inside of it, just half flip it for a wind break and I'm good to go.  I actually won an ice derby last winter with the old stick and string set up, and always use one, in tough conditions. They are pretty much a no fail set up, and work in any condition, for any kind of fish. Ya really can't go wrong.  You really don't need much, but warm gear. That is very important. Lots of wool. Socks, mitts, toque....can't beat merino wool. I don't care what anyone argues, wool is tried, tested and proven to keep ya warm and dry!  Don't cheap out on boots either. Spend a few bucks on quality boots, and some good socks. I really like the Bass pro socks, and they are guaranteed for life!!  After that, you need a decent auger. I drilled with a swede bore for around 20 years before switching to a fin bore 3, and the difference is night and day. It took me a while to get used to turning the fin bore, but once I got the hang of it, drilling a hole is a piece of cake. I have only ever used an 8"", but have drilled and fished from smaller. They are obviously easier to drill, but I like the bigger holes myself. They freeze up slower, and make it that much easier to land a big fish thru. With that said, I have iced a 7lb laker thru a 4"" hole, so I'm not saying a small auger won't work!!! It will, you just gotta take your time with a big fish.  You can go all out and have soo much gear that you won't be able to haul it out, or you can go out and sit on a bucket with a stick and string. You will still catch the same fish. If there is one piece of equipment I would highly reccomend, it would be a graph/flasher. You WILL catch more fish with one thru the ice!  S."
637478,adolson,2011-11-04 20:29:00,783,"Instead of hi-jacking everyone elses' threads about ice fishing, I figured I'd start my own. (Sinclair, put all further invitations for me in here.)  So, as Boss pointed out in the other thread, Le Baron has this InstaShak on sale for around 1/2 price compared to Canadian Tire. The shipping is reasonable, and I am convinced ice fishing is fun (you guys say it, so it must be true), so I want to give it a shot.  Some kind of heater would be good, but I am not sure what works and doesn't break the bank, etc. (I assume you can use a small heater in one of these things?)  I have an old GX125 reel I was hoping to pull off my Ugly Stik and use on a cheap, small ice fishing rod. It's spooled up with 8lb Trilene XT. I also considered buying a Sedona 2500FD (only if I could share spools with my Spirex 2500FG - they look to me to be the same size, but I'm not sure) but I'd use it also in the summer on a second rod.  I would need an auger. Is the Eskimo brand auger any good? Le Baron has 6"", 7"", and 8"" models for $38-44 - which size would you recommend? I've heard 6"" can be too small if you hook a big fish, which is unlikely for me, but would be just my luck. Someone else said that 8"" takes too long to drill. So I was thinking 7"" maybe? It seems uncommon, though. Are the brands at Canadian Tire better? I know they had one by Swede-Bore I saw for about $75.  What other essentials would you suggest I buy? Keeping in mind I have to carry everything on foot and I am not rich. (I know I don't need the shack, but if I do get it (and a heater), I think I can convince the wife to come with me sometimes, and it'd be nice to have that wind break and less blinding light all day long.)  Thanks for any help.   "
637487,Cosmos,2011-11-04 20:53:00,588,"I bought eskimo auger from LeBaron last year and had to exchange it 2 times. Spend a little bit more and get a better one, Swede-Bore is great one - see if you can get it on sale. Where are you planning to fish and what will be your primary target - if it's a panfish go with 6', bigger - 8'. You will need a bucket for minnows  and chair to seat. Probaly a tip-up as well. You will need a small sled - i got mine form CT last year 50% of to get everything to place. I forgot about lures - at least couple rapalas jigging raps, small and big williams, bad boys. Another member Hirk is selling a lot of staff 50% off right now - check classified."
637489,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-04 20:58:00,10439,"Dana There are a lot of guys using the Mr Heater Little Buddy Heaters to heat their huts. They work well in the South (don't put out enough heat for our weather way up North, especially in the depths of winter). You're going to want something to sit on. I prefer those light folding camp chairs for use in my cube. You are also going to want a sled of some sort for dragging your gear out to the fishing grounds. Early ice I have an inexpensive CT sled that I have rigged with rope tie downs (drilled 5/16"" holes 1 foot a part around the rim and threaded 1/4"" poly rope in and out of the holes to give me a place to lash my stuff to) to keep my stuff from falling out.  Here is a pic of my sled.    If you are mostly fishing for pan fish (perch, walleye etc.) a 6"" auger is fine and is much easier to punch holes with. The 8"" takes a lot more work. I have one of these for early season ice fishing and it works well. But I put it away when the ice gets to be a foot thick, then I pull out the 10"" 3HP Strikemaster power auger.  Your reel should work fine. If you find it stiffening up open it up and clean out the grease and replace with some Quantum Hot Sauce or orher cold friendly grease.  Most importantly is safety gear (especially early and late in the season). I carry a set of ice picks and a spud bar for testing ice thickness when walking out to my spot early in the season(spud bar can bee seen on the ice in the first pic)."
637490,adolson,2011-11-04 21:02:00,783,"Thanks for the heads up about the Eskimo auger. I checked the CT site again, and the Swede-Bore is only 6"". I am hoping to go after lakers and walleye as well, so I'm thinking 8"". The other brands I saw on there were Sub-Zero and Normark. There's also a Finbore, but it's $120, compared to $75 for the Normark and $60 for the Sub-Zero."
637493,Nipfisher,2011-11-04 21:25:00,2449,"It is nice when you know guys in North Bay with big huts, and gas augers, that can drive right to their ice shacks. You're welcome at mine any time. Ask NAW it is comfy to sleep in too."
637494,NAW,2011-11-04 21:28:00,4022,"Well the gear can be very simple, or very in depth.  If your trying to save money, I would suggest Kijiji and Garage sales (a little late for garage sales now).  I picked up a used auger for $10.  I bought 4 rods, 2 reels, and 50+ ice fishing lures for $40.   Camp chair %50 off at CT for $10.  You will need a skimmer to clean the ice chunks out of your hole after you drill it, and as it freezes up during your day.  I would highly suggest a steel one.  The plastic ones break very easily.  You really don't need a hut.  Just warm clothes, and a thermos full of hot coffee and baileys.  If you just wanting to try it, a hut could be a big waste of money.  If you're hell bent on getting one, go used.  As far as warm clothes go.  I would suggest a floater suite.  Most are very warm.  See them on Kijiji for $100ish.  I bought a mustang floater from the 90's for 25 bucks on Kijiji, and used it for 2 years before I upgraded to a $400 Salus.  You can get in to Ice fishing really cheap if you want.  Or you can spend thousands..  Either way, once you get out there, you'll love it.  And yes.  Blair's hut is AWESOME..  Nice and warm, and tons of space.  Even has a crapper in it!"
637495,GBW,2011-11-04 21:47:00,8460,"Dana, I only ever use a heater on a very cold and windy day in my Clam 200 hut.  90% of the season I bring it but never use it, you are farther North so you decide.  I got a $100+ heater for $20 or $25 of a member here a few years ago.  Other wise I would still be dressing warmer and heater free.  It's your hands and feet that really get cold.  For your feet to stay a WHOLE LOT warmer, I bring a rubber matt or something else to stand on.  Anything between your boots and the ice/snow makes a HUGE diff. for your feet at the end of the day.  In my hut I don't bother but let's say young_one and I are going out fishing and using his hut, I do my best to bring one!  Same idea can apply to trying to sleep in a hut, get something that can insulate you between the ice and your sleeping bag."
637497,chefboi17,2011-11-04 22:00:00,128,"If your local cdn tire has the fin bore auger, do a price match with lebarons price, there shouldn't be an issue since lebarons are located on Ontario.

637527,danc,2011-11-04 23:45:00,4677,"Dana. Let me back this thread up a couple of decades. To catch fish through the ice you need the following, and nothing more. Transportation to your lake of choice, some half decent winter clothing, a manual ice auger, a slush scoop, a couple of spools of mono, some hooks and sinkers, and some bait. You don't need any rods and reels, heaters, ice huts, gas augers etc."
637529,adolson,2011-11-04 23:56:00,783,"Yeah.. you're right. I think maybe I'll just get a good auger, and a rod for my reel (just because it's cheap, and I'd rather reel than pull by hand), and the other stuff you mentioned and see how it goes. I am sure the huts will go on sale again before next winter, if I really end up liking it. I do have a hard time passing up a deal of what I see as about 1/2 price, but it's better to not spend at all, than to spend less. Especially when I'm currently unsure.  GBW, I don't have a snowmachine (you mentioned this in that other thread)."

If you don't know how to use one reliably, get some old Army gruntto teach you."
637564,OutdoorDan,2011-11-05 02:00:00,325,"Dana,  If you're not sure and just want to try out ice fishing for a bit, why don't you just head over to Cook's Bay for some perch?  Pick a nice sunny day that's not windy, and you won't even need an auger because there are going to be a bunch of holes pre drilled for you .  This way you don't have to buy any speciality gear at all.  While fishing in a crowd in someone else's previously used holes isn't many people's cup of tea (or mine), it's good to just try something new out for a bit. "
637566,Twocoda,2011-11-05 02:05:00,4130,"since this is a ""prep"" thread and im trying to increase my post count ....ill say make sure you have 2012 fishing license.."
637571,crappieperchhunter,2011-11-05 02:25:00,2582,"I say find out if you enjoy it before you spend a lot of $$$ on it. Skip the hut, skip the heater. Bundle up and head out on a nice day and give it a go. The best advice I can give is dress light for the walk out. I stuff my extra cloths in a waterproof bag. Do your walk and drill your holes. Once you have settled in if you start to get chilled start layering the extra cloths on. It's a lot better then wearing too much cloths out and getting all sweaty and then sitting out in the elements with damp cloths and getting a chill...cause that will ruin your day faster then anything.  I would also suggest sunglasses and a baseball cap to keep the sun/glare out of your eyes.  I use a 5 inch strikemaster lazer auger for 90% of my fishing..so I wouldn't worry too much about an auger bigger then 6 inches to start.  Get out and give it a go."

He doesn't need anything more than what I suggested. Think you're the king of cold because of where you live? Don't you work indoors? I worked outdoors in Red Lake last Jan., Feb., and March when -30 was a nice day. 3 years ago I worked north of Pickle Lake outdoors in -50 temps. And 6 years ago I worked in average -45 temps in Marten Falls, where the Ogoki meets the Albany, for 3 months . Bottom line here is that you can enjoy ice fishing or any other outdoor activity with decent clothing."

Just need your basics really, but am considering getting a hut this year too. I had ordered the same hut from Lebaron but the 4 man is on back order as of this week. I already got the little buddy because I need it, and this year will bring a pad for the feet.  However, my buddy had the same hut last year and had to return it twice because of one issue or another, so am in the process of sourcing a different one. Trying to find a pop up with thermal fabric."

637590,adolson,2011-11-05 04:59:00,783,"Alright, I have decided that here's what I'm going to try to get:  I have chairs and clip-on polarized sunglasses already, as well as a rod holder (my hands). I need to find a ballcap big enough to fit on my fat head (for summer fishing, too, it'd be a help). I'll skip the other, more expensive stuff until I'm sure I'm addicted, and at that point I'll probably get some snowshoes before a hut or anything like that.  There's still a while before ice yet, so I'll keep my eyes open for sales and used stuff. Even if I bought all of this new, I think it would be manageable.  Thanks for the input!   It's like almost 6 hours south from me! That's a long drive just to get some perch... lol  There are tons of lakes around me. The hardest part of summer fishing was choosing which one to stick my canoe in. I reckon ice fishing will be the same., only with an auger in place of the canoe (unfortunately)."

Next, buy a long plastic sleigh to haul your stuff.  A five foot sleigh will cost less than 20 dollars.  I think I paid 14 dollars for mine about 10 years ago and it has seen a lot of mileage.  I even haul it behind my snowmobile.  I have a manual 8 or 9 inch ice auger.  I bought it about 35 years ago and I still have the original blades.  I prefer the 8 inch size because I use it for fishing for cod and halibut in the Saguenay river.  Buy a second set of blades because if you hit even a couple of grains of sand in the ice, the blades will no longer cut ice.  The blades are difficult to sharpen and cost over 20 dollars for a new set.  If you do not sharpen your blades yourself after every outing.....forget the manual auger.  Most of the time, I use an ice spud that I made myself.  The blade is about 2 1/2 inches wide and I keep it sharp.  It takes about 5 minutes to cut through 2 feet of ice and make a hole that is about 10 inches in diameter.  It's much easier to haul an ice spud than a gas auger or manual auger.  The ice spud never breaks down either.  An ice spud will also quickly open up holes that have frozen over.  A 6 inch diameter hole will freeze up much faster than an 8 or 9 inch hole.  Yes....a heater/cooker is real handy.  I use a 5000 btu heater and it's quite cozy in my 2 man shelter.  When I mean cozy, that means that I keep my all of my clothes on yet I can loosen my coat and fish with my bare hands if I can warm them in my pockets every once in a while.  Very little ice will form in the hole through the ice.   A 1 lb propane bottle gives me about 4 hours of heat.  I refill my 1 lb bottles myself.  Get the warmest boots you can find and buy them large enough for you to be able to add a a thick insole between the insulated inner felt boot and the sole of the boot.  I use size 11 or 12 high snowboots rated for -74F on my size 10 feet.  Buy a large sized parka with hood and wear an insulated vest under the parka.  Also wear headware with ear flaps.  No such thing as wearing too much clothing.  Nothing worse than getting cold when ice fishing.  The people who do not like icefishing is due to the fact that they do not dress warmly enough.  They are the sort of people who get out of their vehicles at the shopping mall and run to the door and once inside, they complain about how cold it is.  When they do try to dress warmly, they still like their clothes to look trendy or sexy.  I doubt very much that you will use snowshoes.  I've never needed them unless I went to some small remote lakes."
