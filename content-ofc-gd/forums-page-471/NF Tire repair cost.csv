637230,shane,2011-11-04 00:17:00,652,I just had a leaky tire fixed today here in London at an independent tire shop. $31.00+tx.
637233,Muskieman,2011-11-04 00:21:00,2472, Independents usually the best places to go....
637234,smally21,2011-11-04 00:25:00,993,"if i had a shop, i wouldn't tie up a hoist and a mechanic for 20. surprised so many places are willing to do this."
637235,mercman,2011-11-04 00:25:00,7054,"  I thought about saying that, but wouldnt dare"
637244,HTHM,2011-11-04 00:48:00,4082," Thank you, this is exactly the type of reply that helps me come to grips with my mistaken thought regarding the cost of this repair. Usually if the tire is leaking, it stays on the car and is filled up as required. Now that I understand what is involved in the repair, and I am certain it is done right, I feel much better about what I paid. OK mods, lock 'er up before it gets nasty."
637247,GBW,2011-11-04 00:51:00,8460,I know the right gift for your brother-in-law.....      a flaming bag of.....
637248,Grimace,2011-11-04 00:54:00,2020,"Somebody else's brother in law patched my tire from the inside, fixed a rim leak and fixed a stem leak all on one tire (the trifecta) for 20.  I don't know who's brother in law he is, but he isn't mine.  Just some tire dude to me."
637251,northernpike56,2011-11-04 00:56:00,717,"I wouldent be complaining if I were you... I just bought a BMW this year and found out that winter tires (with the alloys) are $3000...  Needless to say, the car will be sitting in the garage all winter."
637252,Grimace,2011-11-04 00:57:00,2020,He balanced the tire too.  I watched him.  The whole situation took about 25 minutes.
637253,livinisfishin,2011-11-04 01:01:00,661,Had no idea plugs weren't allowed anymore. How long has that been in effect?
637260,NAW,2011-11-04 01:29:00,4022," My buddy just bought a beamer this year too.  Bought a used set of rims and tires, but one tire was damaged.  That one tire cost him almost $500 installed and ballanced.  I almost    my pants when he told me..  Some ""run flat"" winter tire.."
637273,Grimace,2011-11-04 01:55:00,2020,"  Yeah, your right.   Poor you.   lol.   Maybe just get a steel black rim for the winter like the rest of us.    :P  :P"
637293,johnl,2011-11-04 03:13:00,197,3 timmies coffees is what a plug cost me 2 weeks ago took less than 2 mins have had them before with no problems
637307,ecmilley,2011-11-04 04:18:00,2163,"that's a proper reapir done from the inside and it takes 20-30 mins depending on tire size, while push plugs are still legal there use is discouraged as they are classed as a temporary repair"
637600,Photoz,2011-11-05 11:23:00,792,"Within the FIRST month I had my new van I picked up a screw nail in the front right & a TEENY sliver of metal (??) right rear. . . . .   my mechanic plugged 'em both, $15.00, no receipt, 80000 klicks later, still holding, no leaks . . . .   I just put 4 new ones on last month . . . . O W W W W  W   W  C   H!"
637603,lew,2011-11-05 11:42:00,12766,I went over a piece of wood about 7 years ago and a drywall screw went thru the sidewall. I took it to the dealer where I bought the truck and was told they could patch or plug the tread section of a tire but weren't allowed to do any repairs on a sidewall.
637608,dave524,2011-11-05 12:06:00,4508, Ditto what he said
637614,woodenboater,2011-11-05 12:30:00,2277, This has always been my understanding as well Lew. Probably has to do with the different stresses and flexion sidewalls undergo. I'm not a tire expert so ymmv
637616,Billy Bob,2011-11-05 12:34:00,5865,"I agree with Skeeter....I have onboard, a flat tire fix kit (plugs)...NEVER had a problem with them....meanwhile all the semi-trucks are running around with retread tires that come apart on the highway..."
637629,skeeter,2011-11-05 14:03:00,1907,"1 of the tricks I use when putting those tar black plugs in is, after the plug is in, light the plug on fire with a lighter and let it melt back down over the repair to give it a good seal."
637636,GBW,2011-11-05 15:43:00,8460,I hope you haven't had any of your chili when doing that~~~~~~~
637642,Bernie,2011-11-05 17:03:00,3190,I never plug a sidewall and depending on sidewall damage am hesitant to even patch. Lots of flexing goes on in the sidewall.  But plugs in tread surface are totally legal.  The plain rubber ones I will not use. I really like the brown fiber strand style. Tough as can be and have a sealer as part of the compound.  Rarely an issue with them.  A few years ago I ran over a sharp stick with my ATV back at the hunt camp. It was a slash over an inch long. Put in a dozen of them just to see if it would hold. It did. I left the tire on that winter just to see what would happen. It held all the way to the next hunting season when I put on a new set.
638132,cjgraham,2011-11-07 18:58:00,104,wow thats steep just got mine patched the other day for 20 bucks
637156,HTHM,2011-11-03 21:29:00,4082,"I picked up a nail in my tire and went a well-know tire dealer, (not CTC), to get it repaired. After the repair was done I was presented with a bill for $42.35. He dismounted the tire and patched it from the inside, remounted and balanced the tire. Is that unreasonable? He did not offer to plug it as that is not a ""recommended"" procedure for repairing a leak."
637158,davey buoy,2011-11-03 21:32:00,5505,Last time I had a nail(6mths ago)it was $20 bucks.That was a patch as plugs are not legal anymore
637159,scugpg,2011-11-03 21:32:00,1373,Thought it was around $20
637160,misfish,2011-11-03 21:33:00,29133,"From what I understand,plugs are not allowed. Yes stores still sell them for do it yourself. As for the price,thats alittle high. 35 bucks in this area. 20 bucks if you bring it in, off the car."
637161,Hooked,2011-11-03 21:33:00,891,Last 2 times I had a nail in my tire I took it to Walmart and cost only cost $20. No slow leaking afterwards either.
637166,mercman,2011-11-03 21:42:00,7054,"Not sure Albert, i usually sell my car when i get a flat,but it seems a bit pricey.He probably charged the mechanics rate of 85 bucks an hour. 1/2 for the repair would put it around 42.50."
637168,HTHM,2011-11-03 21:44:00,4082,This is what makes it very interesting......he is my brother-in-law

637171,mercman,2011-11-03 21:47:00,7054," well, at least he isn't your ""real"" brother.I wouldnt buy him a gift for Christmas, but thats just me"

637175,Rod Caster,2011-11-03 21:49:00,5784,My tire was patched at a local shop for $27.  
637176,skeeter,2011-11-03 21:49:00,1907,"Go to ctc/walmart/princess auto ect. Get yourself a plug kit.  http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/4/Auto/AutoRepairAccessories/SpecialtyRepair/PRD~0092139P/Victor+Car+Tubeless+Tire+Repair+Kit.jsp?locale=en  I have used these plugs for over 20 years and never had 1 leak. At 1 time I had a minimum of 13 in each side wall on my van, until I caught the little bugger that was playing with an ice pick."
637180,mercman,2011-11-03 21:52:00,7054," Musta been real pretty runnin down the highway with little ""warts"" all over your tire walls"
637181,misfish,2011-11-03 21:57:00,29133,"  Try to explain it to a cop after you blow yer tire out, and cause havic on the road. They are not permitted any more.   So in the side wall eh. Yer a brave man."
637183,skeeter,2011-11-03 22:05:00,1907,"It took place over 3 months and I was driving every day to work and back. Scarborough-mississauga, 75 km's a day on the 401. Crazy, yes. that should tell you how well they work."

637205,bushart,2011-11-03 23:09:00,2628,42 bucks--whatsa new tire cost??
637207,bigugli,2011-11-03 23:14:00,6138,Does he wear Klompen?
637210,Woodsman,2011-11-03 23:17:00,1286,My guess is $20/$25 + balancing + tax. For $20 how many actually had the tire balanced also? Or paid cash under the table? Marking the place of the valve stem then remounting will get it somewhat close but balancing is still better.
637212,woodenboater,2011-11-03 23:24:00,2277,"x2 wow. it's not like you're looking for a freebie but seriously...that would be the last time I took anything to his shop. If it was my relo, I'd have done it for free or at least give a break but that's me  ps-didn't know plugs are now illegal. Last time I was in NoÃ«lville with a slow leak, they plugged it up nice, too bad. anyone know the reasoning ?"
637214,Uncle Buck,2011-11-03 23:29:00,1000,and this is why i buy tires at costco...  free lifetime rotation/balancing/flat repair and nitrogen filled also...  The cheapest price is not always the best option
637216,NAW,2011-11-03 23:30:00,4022, Do you drink a lot of his beer when you visit?
637220,Muskieman,2011-11-03 23:40:00,2472,"It's not at all unreasonable...40$ or so seems to be about the going rate.  As for a plug kit.... Hmmm... good to have in a jam but should be for temporary use only...  I used to be a Tire Buster at a few shops and recently quit selling auto parts... we supplied garages with their tire repair supplies... as far as I know the only legal tire repair in Ontario on LT or P or ST series tire is a Combi-Patch or Patch/Plug....  Looks like this...   Garages might sell the unit for 10$ or more depending on the size of the puncture..  40$ or so is worth it.. consider that the tire is re-inflated,dunked in a tank to find the leak/s, deflated, put on a machine ,taken off the wheel, put in a Tire-Vise , puncture hole is reamed and ground down from the inside, cleaned , adhesive is added, the 10$ or more Patch/Plug is pulled through the reamed puncture hole and stuck onto the adhesive and is then passed under a variety of rollers....  put back onto the wheel..re-inflated, dunked again in a tank.. and put on another machine to balance it....  And as mentioned above... if you bring in a car-less wheel/tire the cost would probably be cheaper.   Randy "
