Yesterday after leaving a message on their receptionests voice mail and not getting any response from her, I dialed the Toronto office number again but this time went into their directory by name. Since I didn't have a name to work with I just started entering random letters until the automated system gave me a name and told me to press star if this was the person I wanted to talk to.  Good, now I had an idea of the format for their extension numbers! I just kept calling and entering extension numbers in sequense. It took several attempts but I finally got a person to answer the phone and after explaining my problem they forwarded me to a very nice young lady named Erin.  Erin was very helpful, apologized for the problems we'd experienced and within a matter of about two minutes was able to confirm that yes they had in fact received our order and the unit would be shipped as soon as they could. She then sent me a very nice email confirming our conversation.  Thank you Erin! I have now earned enough brownie points to go hunting or fishing just about anytime I want for the rest of this fall!"
