637975,Adam Delves,2011-11-07 10:18:00,28,Anybody been to the pier lately?  It was recommended that I give it a try for walleye and to go late in the evening. Just wondering if the bite was on and perhaps what I should bring for gear. Having never been is the pier lit up or should I be bringing light with me?
638084,Frank,2011-11-07 15:38:00,74,"  I never fish on the pier when I go to Maitland, I have decent luck with all sorts of species fishing off the rocks or the wall leading up to the pier (left side of boat ramp), so I would bring a light with you. I am not sure if the bite is on for walleye right now, as I have not been to Maitland in about two months but a quick google search on walleye rigs should help get you a fish. If you have any other questions, Steve Hardcastle at ""Fishmasters Ultimate Charters Bait & Tackle"" in Dunnville is very helpful and will have all the tackle you need before you head out.  Goodluck."
