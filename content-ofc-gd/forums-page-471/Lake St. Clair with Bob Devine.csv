637431,Handlebarz,2011-11-04 17:09:00,3790,Beauty fish Bob great to see you guys getting some big girls on the DR
637887,msp,2011-11-06 22:18:00,1336,Nice fish guys. Good job Bob.
638086,Leecher,2011-11-07 15:41:00,7832,Thick is an understatement    Beauty ski Whitemikeca    Congrats Thanks for sharing Leechman
637132,Whitemikeca,2011-11-03 20:39:00,138,"Addy79 and I were out on St.Clair yesterday with Bob Devine.  We had a tough day trolling so Bob had us switch to Jigging with some great success!      The fish was approx 48 inches but could have been 49"" if we did a proper measurement.  As you can see it was a pretty fat fish for a 48.  We had two other hook ups but lost both fish to ""angler error"".  It was our first time jigging musky so......  I would highly recommend Bob to anyone looking to get out on St. Clair for the first time.  He is an excellent guide and just a great person.  Google him if you would like contact info.  Highly recommended."
637139,mistaredone,2011-11-03 20:57:00,913,Awesome fish mike!!!  Way 2 go!  Give me a hollar if you wanna make another trip to LSC
637144,lew,2011-11-03 21:03:00,12766,"Big fat fish, well done !!  I was in that exact spot 13 days ago but that large girl just didn't want to come out and play that day"
637147,rocheleauc,2011-11-03 21:05:00,205,wow look at those monsters.  nice work
637148,Whitemikeca,2011-11-03 21:07:00,138, Thanks Lew.  Its a great spot indeed.  There were a lot of musky's boated in that area.  The second and third pictures were taken from John Bondy's boat.  He had Gord Pyzer in his boat for the day and they had said they were 6 for 8.  We also saw a few other boats bring in fish in the same spot.  My bad for telling Bob I wanted to troll.  Instead we should have focused our efforts at this spot the whole day instead of just the last hour or so.
637153,Joey,2011-11-03 21:23:00,9122,"Wow, nice fatty there"
637169,scugpg,2011-11-03 21:45:00,1373,Nice job guys. Bob is a great guy to get out with and find the fish.
637177,Pigeontroller,2011-11-03 21:49:00,2793,Real nice fall fatty!
637187,brandon,2011-11-03 22:14:00,857,nice fish...and you're welcome for the photos
637189,mercman,2011-11-03 22:15:00,7054,Dang !!!! Huge Beasts for sure.Kinda look like toothy torpedos
637194,Bob Devine,2011-11-03 22:23:00,251,"Sorry Brandon, Mike did not get your name.  The bottom 2 pictures were taken by Brandon Broderick Photography. As always he does great work, thanks again."
637202,Whitemikeca,2011-11-03 23:00:00,138," Haha, thanks Brandon!  Brandon was also in the boat with Bondy and Pyzer, haha"
637259,Moosebunk,2011-11-04 01:26:00,3970,Seen a few pics with that same appartment in the background of a shot.  Pretty wicked to fish a muskie fishery where they're in there almost as thick as pike on some quality northern fishery.  Great ski.
637262,Grimace,2011-11-04 01:30:00,2020, I wonder if they have one for rent.  Who needs a cottage if you have an apartment on St. Clair.  lol   Real nice fat fish gentleman.  Real nice.
637266,brandon,2011-11-04 01:38:00,857,That's Solidarity Tower and it's right at the mouth of St. Clair... and I believe there's about a 7 year waiting list!
637275,esoxansteel,2011-11-04 02:04:00,1307,"Very nice fish, love those St. Clair spotties"
637296,Bob Devine,2011-11-04 03:23:00,251,"Congrats to Brandon who fished today and almost had a ""TRIFECTA"" 3 yes 3-50 inchers today. I dont want to spoil his day and let him tell you the details. Brandon remember to block the secret background!!"
637312,hawk-eye,2011-11-04 05:03:00,141,"When you started jiggin, were you guys using the Bondy Bait? I picked a couple up this summer but have not had the opportunity to use them yet.  Nice fish!"
637323,fishindevil,2011-11-04 10:51:00,6254,well done guys !!! great colors on the ski too....nice spot to go for sure...
637335,Bob Devine,2011-11-04 12:08:00,251,Yes we were jigging the Bondy Bait. It has been producing muskies since it hit the water. Canadian made too!
637344,corvette1,2011-11-04 12:29:00,1765,awesome fat ski congrats
637346,Whitemikeca,2011-11-04 12:45:00,138,"  WOW, congrats Brandon!  Thats awesome!  I am going to have to get back down there soon."
637389,addy79,2011-11-04 15:13:00,573,"Saying LSC was an impressive fishery would be an understatement. I've never seen a sonar show so much activity over miles of water. BIG props out to Bob Devine, this was the first time I've ever had the pleasure of fishing with a pro and can say with confidence that it definitely wonÂ’t be my last. Spending a day on a boat with someone with that much pedigree in the fishing world is an incredible learning experience. Picking Bob's brain on the water was almost as much fun as hunting down these giants.  ""If you wanna take in scenery and mosquitoes go north; if you wanna catch fish come to LSC""  Bob ROCKS!  "
637417,Bob Devine,2011-11-04 16:45:00,251,Thanks for the kind words and I look forward to fishing with you and Mike again.
637426,ccmtcanada,2011-11-04 16:57:00,7971,WOW!!! Sweet fish!!!
