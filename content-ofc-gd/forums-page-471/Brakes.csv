So far the best I've found is autopartswarehouse, but my front and back rotor would be 2 different brands cause their out of stock in one. Not sure if that would make a big difference. What pads would you guys recommend? Everyone is telling me ebc greenstuff or hks lts. I know all my stuff when it comes to track cars but couldn't tell ya a think when it comes to pads and towing. My boat fully loaded is prob bit over 2500lbs  Thanks"
