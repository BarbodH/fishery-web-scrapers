637912,misfish,2011-11-06 23:58:00,29133,YEP NICE FINISH.  Going to be a great 2 races. Sorry to see you took Kyle.
637915,Joey,2011-11-07 00:07:00,9122,"Ha, nope, thank the Lord I did not, whew!!!"
637917,DRIFTER_016,2011-11-07 00:07:00,10439,  I love how NASCAR handled Kyle after Friday nights Bull. As for the chase I'll be happy with either Tony or Carl as they are both deserving.
637919,misfish,2011-11-07 00:14:00,29133, They need to do that more often.No matter the driver.
638032,Mike Pike,2011-11-07 14:06:00,1332,"I PRV'd the race, successfully avoided watching highlights, and then log on to OFC for some fishing stuff.  Safe right?  AAAARGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!  And what's worse, I'm an Edwards fan.  ("
638366,mikeseb,2011-11-08 03:59:00,201,"id love to see carl take it, can only imagine how big the classic backflip off the roof of the car would be after winning it all haha"
638395,Mike Pike,2011-11-08 11:50:00,1332,"Ya, I'm pulling for Edward too.  I wish he had won more races this year, though.  Tony's won 4 times so even if Carl DOES win the chase, there's one part of me that says Tony deserves it more.  Oh well, next races are gonna be crazy!"
638402,Joey,2011-11-08 12:41:00,9122,  Sorry about that Mike - oops!   Get with the real world time will ya     YUP
638432,Mike Pike,2011-11-08 15:20:00,1332,"Hah hah hah!  That's not the first time I've been accused of being in a time warp, Joey!"
638433,misfish,2011-11-08 15:21:00,29133,Can he make it 3 in a row? I hope so.
638459,mikeseb,2011-11-08 16:11:00,201,Im just happy its someone other than Jimmie this year LOL   .  Although what he did was pretty remarkable.
