638131,cjgraham,2011-11-07 18:55:00,104,"""LEAFS' CONNOLLY OUT 10-14 DAYS WITH UPPER BODY INJURY"" as reported on TSN  . I am beginning to think this guy gets hurt on purpose. Time to ship him to the Habs and give Colbourne a chance."

638231,Rizzo,2011-11-07 23:26:00,4754,I guess we (Leaf or Connolly fans)were just hoping this time things would be different. So far it is not looking good
638352,lookinforwalleye,2011-11-08 03:23:00,4399, Good idea he and markov can play tiddlywinks in the press box with helmets on of course wouldn`t want them to get concussed by a wayward tiddly!!!

638378,SlowPoke,2011-11-08 05:31:00,2984,You have to make deals like this from time to time and keep your fingers crossed. A guy like Connolly has a lot of upside even if you can't get 82 games out of him. Antropov comes to mind.
638441,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-11-08 15:44:00,0,we hate to tell you we told you so... but...
