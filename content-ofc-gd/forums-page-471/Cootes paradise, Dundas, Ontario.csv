638587,I'mHooked,2011-11-09 00:04:00,525,"On a hike there a couple weeks ago I noticed that you'd have to walk about 30 yards through muck just to get to water that was 6""-12"" deep. Water's edge was way out from shore."
638639,fishing,2011-11-09 01:55:00,167,"Yellow perch, goldfish, white perch, sunfish, catfish, chubs and shiners, all small. Also some carp, trout, pike, bass, mostly small too."
638659,Canitalian,2011-11-09 02:46:00,75,Thanks Fishing. I'm gonna try it out tomorrow morning. I'll let you know what's going on.
638663,northernpike56,2011-11-09 02:50:00,717,"I know that you have bass, pike, panfish, trout, drum, carp, bullheads, etc. kicking around there. Not sure what you'd catch right now though. maybe a trout?"
638670,Canitalian,2011-11-09 03:26:00,75,I'll try Northern. Hope for the best. The ice will be here soon enough for some real fishing. Can't wait.
