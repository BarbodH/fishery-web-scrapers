911260,MrSimon,2015-04-20 19:03:00,217,"Howdy.  My cottage is only 6 miles from you .... of course there is this little thing between us called a National Border (and a giant river).  I fish the river out front of Brockville quite a bit.  I'm sure there are better stretches to fish, but I do fine.  I love the big shoals that are out there as well as the deep water humps.  I usually come up once or twice a year to fish for a few days by myself.  I'll give you a shout next time I'm up there."
