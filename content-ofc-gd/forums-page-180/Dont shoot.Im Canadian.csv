911301,Terry,2015-04-20 22:55:00,14456,water was really dirty the last spot we fished but a good variety of fish

That's wicked!  until the wind blows  then it becomes a sail What he said Nick. Funny how a flag can move ya around when the wind picks up.   Thumbs up from me Bri,  Thanks Chris.   I'll say HI,I'll just make sure I don't get to close and in the way of your line(s) lol.  Only one line allowed during the open water season Davey. Stop by as I know you will be out in the same areas this summer.   But does the flag stay where you leave it for ""tomorrow"", at this time of year?   LMAO Some will never know what you mean Wayne. But when I was asked to look for one the next day, I was surprised how small it was when I found it.   Looks like a goose decoy to me! LOL   woulda said turkey, but they don't swim  HEY HEY HEY NOW. LOL   You should try fly fishing with that setup, just make sure someone's videotaping at the time  I tried last year flinging large pike flies. Bad idea. Will stick to bass flies this year.   I like the ""stache"" almost as much as the toon.  It,s my new late Dale SR look.  Nice video bud. Herring,whitie and a large bass. Couldnt make out if it was a largie or small mouth.  This weekend Im looking for crappies."

But is it legal?  Flying the Canadian flag on an unregistered vessel?  The Safe Boating Guide lists several benefits of registering a vessel which include, ""the right to fly the Canadian flag"".  That would imply that owners of unregistered boats do not have this right.  As long as you don't take my spot I won't say anything"
