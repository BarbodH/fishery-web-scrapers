This is around 3 hours from home so to help justify the trip I was thinking about taking my boat and making it a 2-3 day trip and get some fishing in...  It's the last weekend of July...  So I was wondering if anyone could recommend a lake or river close by where we might get into some decent fishing... I love walleye but bass, pike and maybe even trolling lakers would be fun too...  If push comes to shove I can hit the Ottawa river as well...  Like everyone says I'm not looking for secret spots... Lol... And PMs are welcome for privacy...  I'd prefer to stay within an hour of Dacre  Thanks everyone"
911448,KraTToR,2015-04-21 17:20:00,506,"I'd say try the Ottawa river. Launch at Arnprior and you'll have lots of river in both directions.  There's a good musky fishery in that area, concentract at the mouths of the feeder rivers.  I haven't fished for bass or walleye in this area but I'm sure they are there ."
911482,wallyboss,2015-04-21 19:49:00,1095,"Muskrat Lake In Cobden has multiple species, lakers, bass,walleyes, pike."
911493,simonl,2015-04-21 20:20:00,28,Constance lake right in Dacre has an awesome bass population with a chance of catching the odd walleye. There is a decent boat ramp at the campground but you can also put a good sized boat in off the road in Balacava.
911574,Moosebunk,2015-04-22 01:35:00,3970,"What Wallyboss said with Muskrat, or quite close to Dacre with places to stay as well is Lake Clear.  A 40+ inch pike was caught there this season through the ice, and it's historically had big fish.  There's also plenty walleyes and BIG smallies, and some lakers may still be kicking around."
911583,muskymatt,2015-04-22 02:17:00,2608,I'll pm you tomorrow
911600,mike rousseau,2015-04-22 07:07:00,4661,Thanks everyone...  Looks like lotsa options so far...
911601,fishindevil,2015-04-22 07:53:00,6254,Mike hit the Ottawa river man !!! Been going there well over 20yrs !!! It's only a short drive and never know a fish of a lifetime could be yours !!! My choice would be clear ..... But yes lots of options in the area like the guys stated above but being that close to the mighty Ottawa go for it !!!!! Fish-on  )
911670,davew3,2015-04-22 16:54:00,430,Do a check on resorts on Golden Lake.  Just north west of Renfrew.   A place I have always wanted to go. All species.  Regards
