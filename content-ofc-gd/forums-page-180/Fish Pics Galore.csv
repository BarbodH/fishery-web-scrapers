911769,Paulus,2015-04-22 22:56:00,522,"Did you take any pics of them on the spawning beds?  Not yet. Though I expect I will at some point. Still, it's harder to get a good shot when they're in the water. Results are far more spectacular when they are flying through the air  Depending on your camera I'd be using back button focusing with AI-Servo.    You're losing a lot of time by using one button for both auto focus and shutter.  Also if you know there jumping in a specific spot, manual focus the lens and use a remote shutter.  So you can just sit there in your lawn chair and press a button anytime one jumps, if your DOF is deep enough it should work.  Also use high speed continuous for your 'Drive' mode.  No go back and try that, lol!   I would, except... well... they're mostly on the redds now, down here at least. Hopefully they are mostly done by the time 12:am Saturday rolls around... Not sure mine (T2i has a back button, but I'll check).  Now my shift is done and I'm heading home to flick another button... the little red one on the remote!  p.-"
911794,BillM,2015-04-23 00:43:00,17367,"Paul, you should be able to set the 'that other site-ON' button to be the Autofocus (Which is why they call it back button focusing)...."
910034,Paulus,2015-04-14 13:04:00,522,"Hi all,  it's been a while since I posted (life being that way... sometimes...) but I always love to share my ""jumping steelhead"" pics with this group. I was down at the local dam this weekend, with my 300mm zoom lens, hoping for good results. A tiny bit of cropping & a few adjustments later and... you be the judge!                 p.-"
910036,BillM,2015-04-14 13:06:00,17367,Beauties!!   I'll bring my 100-400mm and tripod and let you have a go at it  :)

911454,Paulus,2015-04-21 17:45:00,522,"  Good lens, good lighting, fast shutter speed and a bit of luck.   Paul has it down pat.  That's about it, and a sore buttocks...I sat there for an hour with my eye stuck to the viewfinder, doing my best to click whenever I saw one jump. So I snapped well over 300 shots, most of which were either out of focus or had a tail in it or just a head etc... Some of them were just really crisp freeze-frame pictures of running water, lol. . Another trick, if you have a dslr (probably works with upper end point and shoot cameras too), is to press the shutter button halfway and keep it pressed, while you wait for the next fish to make its move. That way, the camera is already focused when the fish passes through the sight & it doesn't waste any extra time before engaging the shutter.  Thanks for the kind words everyone .  p.-"
