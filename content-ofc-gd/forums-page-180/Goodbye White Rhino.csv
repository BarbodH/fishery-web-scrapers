911766,sneak_e_pete,2015-04-22 22:48:00,540," Makes me think of Nipissing, Scugog and many other lakes.  Enforced?"
911468,LostAnotherOne,2015-04-21 18:55:00,956,So now there is only five white rhinos left on the planet with one only being male.  He's an old boy and we are hoping that he can produce with a few females.  The rhino is guarded by 24hr security.  There's only one species to thank for this one.  Well done again humans.
911470,highdrifter,2015-04-21 18:58:00,2534,Great.  There's 15 seconds of my life that I'll never get back.  Well done lostanotherone!!
911471,manitoubass2,2015-04-21 19:10:00,11391,You lost another 15 seconds posting...  And another bit belittling someone.
911473,highdrifter,2015-04-21 19:17:00,2534,You're absolutely right.. Someone cancel my account!!
911486,Craigson,2015-04-21 19:59:00,117,Seriously? Trolling forums is overrated.

911490,LostAnotherOne,2015-04-21 20:16:00,956,Can't make everyone happy.  Highdrifter it's best if you join another site cause this sites for grownups.  Punk kid
911494,BillM,2015-04-21 20:22:00,17367,Can't make everyone happy.  Highdrifter it's best if you join another site cause this sites for grownups.  Punk kid  Turn your sarcasm meter back on...   Cause that flew RIGHT over your head.
911496,misfish,2015-04-21 20:29:00,29133,".  Punk kid   Now that made me laugh.  One white rino, old as you say. Can he get it up? Or will they be doing it with injections to produce more?"
911534,Fang,2015-04-21 23:00:00,1330,"Northern white rhinos have been limited to all captive specimens for over a decade(s) with that number now down to 5 from the December death. This rhino was 44 and way past breeding age  The biggest issue here is from the conservation authorities and governments that will not try to establish a population through mixed breeding with southern white rhinos who have rebounded well in the past number of years do to high and extreme conservation efforts  There is reported lots of breeding material in frozen storage but at this time captive breeding has been limited to very low success and current technology  Probably more info than needed as it shadows the terrible way humans have decimated this animal, but I really like rhinos"
911544,cram,2015-04-21 23:36:00,1733,"Maybe those scientists who are trying to clone wooly mammoths should direct their efforts at these guys instead.  Far more ethical, IMO."
911553,Paudash,2015-04-22 00:38:00,273,sort of what I was thinking as well
911581,moxie,2015-04-22 02:10:00,1566,"Seriously? Trolling forums is overrated. Matter of opinion and since everyone, including yourself  is allowed one, is it still considered trolling? I prefer casting but trolling can be just as much fun at times.   Edited to add; Shame about the White Rhino as their 15 minutes might be coming to an unfortunate end."
911588,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-22 03:07:00,10439,Sad about the rhinos for sure. They are pretty serious about their conservation and game enforcement in Africa now. Most of the time the park rangers and game cops just fill the poachers full of lead.  I myself like trolling. Caught the fish in my profile pic trolling.
911591,ch312,2015-04-22 03:16:00,1590,Mmmm....White Rhino *stomach rumbles*   I thought winternet would be over by now?
911592,Acountdeleted,2015-04-22 03:40:00,2562,There are only 5 left because the MNR were never handing out tickets to people at the locks who were fishing white rhyno out of season.
911610,Shloim,2015-04-22 11:14:00,515,I hate people that fish rhino OOS!
911614,Rod Caster,2015-04-22 11:45:00,5784,"I guess white rhinos will have a lot in common with red herrings.  Very sad indeed, the white rhino is a high profile animal... imagine all the others that go extinct without anyone caring or possibly even knowing about! There is my big sad thought for the day, now back to my little un-influential world"
911636,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-22 14:19:00,2582,I'm told they taste just like Muskie Sorry just had that in me.  Seriously though...sad to hear.
911643,Headhunter,2015-04-22 15:15:00,5703,"So we should be saving the eye balls for perchin, just like musky? HH"
911645,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-22 15:21:00,2582,"So we should be saving the eye balls for perchin, just like musky? HH Eyeballs too big for perchin  HH....awesome for carping though"
911647,Headhunter,2015-04-22 15:23:00,5703,Weeds out the runts! HH
911705,davey buoy,2015-04-22 19:13:00,5505,"All kidding aside it's terrible how some cultures do not have many ENFORCED regulations till it's almost to late.Sad to hear this is happening.Hope the ""intro"" works as these are purely awesome giants that should have the right to roam free."
911746,moxie,2015-04-22 21:53:00,1566,Weeds out the runts! HH I'm guessin that would be a visual inspection unlike the digital exam you have mentioned you perform to sort out other things.
