I don't keep anything always catch and release !!! There's alot of mixed feelings about these two harbors eh. I may call the mnr tomorrow and find out the scoop !   Remember also that it is illegal to target out of season fish even if you release everything that you catch.  Looks like you will be fine in Whitby Harbour.  Maybe I will give it a try myself."

910328,highdrifter,2015-04-15 18:50:00,2534,Well I'll be jiggered..  Must be a free for all with all those northerns in full spawn mode..  Let the good times roll!!
910329,Acountdeleted,2015-04-15 19:04:00,2562,"Man, talk about confusing. I wonder why the harbours are zone 17 but frenchmans bay is  zone 20. What a headache."
910437,Gregoire,2015-04-16 12:30:00,1397,"I'm guessing it has to do with the drainage systems. In the Kawartha's (zone 17) there is no closed season on pike.I looks like the Kawartha system drains into the Whitby and Oshawa harbour, but not Frenchman's bay."

The Kawartha Lakes system drains into Bay of Quite in Trenton.  Neither the Whiby Harbour nor Oshawa Harbour are receiving any drainage from the Kawartha Lakes."

910084,jameshandz,2015-04-14 16:15:00,31,HEY EVERYONE KINDA NEW AT THIS THING. JUST WONDERING IF THERE IS ANYWHERE ELSE TO TRY BEFORE PIKE CLOSES UP. IVE TRIED THE OSHAWA AND WHITBY HARBORS WITH ONLY ONE FOLLOW. I HAVE NEVER CAUGHT A PIKE BUT HAVE CAUGHT SMALL MUSKY AND WOULD LIKE TO CATCH ONE THIS SEASON.IM NOT LOOKING FOR A SECRET SPOT JUST GENERAL INFO FROM PEOPLE THAT TARGET THEM .  IM NOT A HUGE PIKE FISHER JUST TRYING TO KILL SOME TIME BEFORE BASS OPENS AND I CAN BE AT MY TRAILER IN THE KAWARTHAS. THANKS IN ADVANCE. 
910088,BillM,2015-04-14 16:25:00,17367,"If you had a follow in Oshawa or Whitby, it's only going to get better as the water warms."
910090,jameshandz,2015-04-14 16:29:00,31,yea im hoping so . saw a guy pull one up about 15 ft down from me . big huskey jerks
910091,BillM,2015-04-14 16:31:00,17367,"So it sounds you've found a spot, keep at it.   Gotta remember the water is cooold, gotta keep those presentations nice and slow (Easier said then done though, lol)"
910117,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-14 18:00:00,937,"Use Rapala Husky Jerks HJ14 or X-Rap XR10 with jerks and log pauses.  When you get them to follow, try to slowly jerk your lure to make it look like a dying bait fish is trying to get away.  That should get them to commit to your lure."
910119,jameshandz,2015-04-14 18:02:00,31,thanks everyone. its gonna be a long wait till bass opens up. Hopefully i can get myself one and post a pic soon
910123,highdrifter,2015-04-14 18:42:00,2534,That's weird..  I thought pike were closed until second week of May..
910124,cuzza,2015-04-14 18:47:00,467,Open all year in Zone 17
910125,jameshandz,2015-04-14 18:51:00,31,thanks cuzza ! LAKE O ZONE 17 DOESNT CLOSE
910148,msp,2015-04-14 19:49:00,1336,Please be careful when reading the regs. Lake Ontario is closed for pike right now
910149,John Bacon,2015-04-14 19:54:00,3277,"thanks cuzza ! LAKE O ZONE 17 DOESNT CLOSE  Lake Ontario, including some bays and harbours, is zone 20.  As others have said, pike is closed right now in these areas.  http://www.ontario.ca/document/2015-ontario-fishing-regulations-summary"
910150,jameshandz,2015-04-14 19:57:00,31,SORRY MY BAD THEY ARE CLOSED TILL FIRST SAT IN MAY . LOOKS LIKE ILL BE CASTING IN THE POOL FOR A MONTH LOL \
910158,Sinker,2015-04-14 20:11:00,8692,"I'm pretty sure whitby harbour is considered zone 17, same as oshawa harbour.  S."
910160,jameshandz,2015-04-14 20:15:00,31,HMM IM NOT TO SURE . LOOKING AT BOTH ZONES 17 SAYS OPEN ALL YEAR WHERE 20 SAYS CLOSED FROM APRIL TILL SAT IN MAY
910166,Rodbender,2015-04-14 20:26:00,1027,good page to start with  https://www.ontario.ca/search/fisheries-management-zone-regulations
910168,highdrifter,2015-04-14 20:27:00,2534,"Lake O is zone 20.  Toronto Harbour is part of zone 20, same for Oshawa Harbor and Whitby Harbor.  Pike are closed until the first saturday in May."

910179,Dave Bailey,2015-04-14 21:18:00,1641,"I should add that Frenchmans Bay is definitely FMZ 20, because it's specifically mentioned in the regulations for then zone. Page 101 of the summary."
910181,jameshandz,2015-04-14 21:26:00,31,yes i was at the whitby harbor the other day and there was tons of people fishing it
910208,Sinker,2015-04-14 23:23:00,8692,"See....read the regs carefully.  P.S....you can still fish lake O for other species, just cant keep pike.  S."
910219,Joeytier,2015-04-15 00:03:00,3990,WHITBY HARBOR IS ZONE 17!  Fish away . There are plenty of pike there
910220,jameshandz,2015-04-15 00:13:00,31,I don't keep anything always catch and release !!! There's alot of mixed feelings about these two harbors eh. I may call the mnr tomorrow and find out the scoop !
910222,Joeytier,2015-04-15 00:22:00,3990,"The only mixed feelings are from people that haven't checked themselves. lol.  It's 100% zone 17 but I guess it's better to hear it straight from the horse's mouth than some guy on the internet.  Oshawa I don't know, never checked."
910230,Dave Bailey,2015-04-15 00:45:00,1641,"Not necessarily, in the other thread I mentioned the poster said he had contacted the ministry, and they didn't know. That's why I posted the maps."
910237,moxie,2015-04-15 01:34:00,1566,"I'm pretty sure whitby harbour is considered zone 17, same as oshawa harbour.  S. Absolutely open. Confirmed by a CO who shall remain nameless until I have to defend myself in court because I was fishing illegally in Whitby Harbour.   Was there this past wknd and water temp barely hit 42."
