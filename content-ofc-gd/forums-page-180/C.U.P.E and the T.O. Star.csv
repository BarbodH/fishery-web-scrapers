That is why I said every government since electricity was ""invented"" has sold it for less than it really cost...  Just looking back at the cost over runs on a lot of hydro projects historically it shows how people thought it was fair to charge something for nothing for the gas plants. Darlington alone was 7.5 Billion over the estimate and that was in 1981 to 1993 dollars. Bill Davis, Frank Miller. David Peterson, and Bob Rae all owned that one...

If not the Liberals, who then?  Maybe most here were too young to remember but it was Bob Rea and his union supporting NDP crew that deemed several large companies operating in Ontario as "" Too big to fail"", 25 years ago. It was the NDP that allowed those companies to slide on their legal obligations for pension plan contributions to their companies pension plans. Fast forward to the last 15 years and most of those pension plans are woefully underfunded. A few of those companies too large to fail in Ontario, Stelco, GM, Chrysler, Proctor and Gamble to name a few. I know of more than a few members on this website that are waiting with baited breath for the outcome of US Steel Canada's CCAA bankruptcy protection and possible sale. The hourly workers that fought for a century for fair wages and benefits and may have experienced several strikes and lockouts to ""earn"" their pensions find that their pensions are underfunded by more than 20% in some cases.

The selling rate to Ontario Hydro soars and Brascan almost drains the entire upper Mississagi watershed producing power at a huge profit.  Some lodges on the system closed due to no water.

911742,Canuck2fan,2015-04-22 21:37:00,1444,"What I don't get is the bias....  When every politician since electricity was invented let Ontario businesses use it for less than it actually cost. No one complained. This left HUGE debts for future ratepayers to deal with. Ironically even more so because a lot of the businesses that sucked on the teat of cheap Hydro as a lure to keep jobs here, left anyway.  When Harris and Eves sold off the assets for Hydro to their buddies leaving us taxpayers with the stranded debt, it was supposed to good for us. Anyone with half a brain KNEW it would lead to HIGHER rates in the future. But no one got near as bitter as everyone is now.  When Eves continued to let us have Hydro for under the market cost no one complained, even though that added to the provincial debt and the debt retirement charge.  When Eves took and spent the money taken in from the DRC instead of putting it toward retiring the debt to make his last budget look balanced no one complained....  Now I don't agree with the Liberals decision not to build the gas plants that cost us 2 billion for nothing but the truth is. NO PARTY was going to build those plants. After the richy rich nimbys complained and they ALL ran candidates who said they weren't going to build them. Why is no one screaming for those few people's heads who complained on platters? Also why is NO one is screaming for the heads of the people who cashed cheques for doing nothing for those plants. That to me is just as much of a crime as what the gutless politicians did.  I also DO NOT agree with paying more for green energy than, for other sources, but again PEOPLE are cashing those cheques too. I have (ex)friends who went insane trying to get in on it by borrowing money to put up solar panels and some of them did. They also have to take some responsibility for accepting that money in my opinion. What is especially galling is they have the audacity to complain about the upcoming rate hike. I said really why don't you take down your solar panel then? That isn't going to happen....  While I am no fan of higher electricity prices, I firmly believe we now have to pay what it really costs. To punt it down the road with artificially lower rates now only to have pay for later with interest is no answer... The problem is how do we determine what is the REAL cost, without speculation and million dollar CEO salaries?  I don't think any political party or the corporations can put aside the corruption and greed to ever make it fair for ratepayers again. It should have never been privatized since it is a necessary commodity not a luxury."
