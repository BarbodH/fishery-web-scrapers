A fittness guy that looked like he was 30, not 56.  Taken so young by that dreaded cancer. 56 years young.  RIP Steve. Always enjoyed your reports..  http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/04/21/steve-byrnes-dies-cancer-battle/26131811/"

Always liked Steve Byrnes, in the NASCAR broadcasting world we are saddled with McReynolds, Kyle Petty and the Waltrips that can't keep their bloody traps shut for more than 2 seconds with their boogity boogity stupidity.  Steve was funny and a class act.  Steve, along with Mike Joy, and the late Benny Parsons are in a class of their own.  I always enjoyed the programs on the SPEED channel hosted by Steve.  Damned cancer."
