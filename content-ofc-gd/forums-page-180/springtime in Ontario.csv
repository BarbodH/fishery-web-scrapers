912103,Roy,2015-04-24 14:42:00,13728,-3C here right now. I'd better give walleye a pass May 9th.
912241,TDunn,2015-04-25 01:40:00,680,"-9 this morning when I left for the rivers north at 5am, snow was still over my knees in LSPP.....and Superior is still locked!!"
912244,manitoubass2,2015-04-25 01:49:00,11391, When for a swim on the 4th of july along ways back and I wont be doing it again!

911691,lew,2015-04-22 18:05:00,12766,I looked out the window 20 minutes ago and the sun was shining.  Five minutes later it was snowing so stinking hard I could barely see the end of my yard and now the sun is poking through the clouds again.  But the best news is I have ONE tulip opening in the garden  
911696,ketchenany,2015-04-22 18:12:00,3229,"Yesterday I drove from Steels and the 404 to Newmarket, sunny, windy, rain, ice pellets and when I got to the hospital some woman was talking snow in the elevator! Ah yes spring has arrived. That tulip will regret ever coming up!"
911697,John Bacon,2015-04-22 18:13:00,3277,Perhaps people were a little hasty in declaring that there was no more snow pack to raise the water levels.
911713,irishfield,2015-04-22 19:42:00,26272,Well get a bucket over that beauty Lew.. as it will be frozen as winter returns tonight!
911718,Whopper,2015-04-22 19:51:00,2174,"Lew I'm on my third cutting on the yard, our tulips and purple wave are in full bloom. I may have to do what Wayne suggested tonight though because we may get a frost the next night or two."
911720,Raf,2015-04-22 19:57:00,3495,ours haven't bloomed yet but they're certainly close.
911721,esoxansteel,2015-04-22 19:57:00,1307,"you and Diane can go tip toeing through the tulip Lew,"
911726,Rich Clemens,2015-04-22 20:11:00,3131,If it makes you feel even better Lew - I have already mowed the lawn this year.
911732,highdrifter,2015-04-22 20:47:00,2534,mmmm deer food!!
911735,misfish,2015-04-22 20:59:00,29133,"Drove home in a white shower. It,s still April folks. LOL"
911738,captpierre,2015-04-22 21:16:00,2521,"Don't get too excited. Looks like the inevitable, pesky weeds are coming too in your picture"
911748,Canuck2fan,2015-04-22 22:06:00,1444,Awesome pic Lew....  I had to go out on some errands today and was NOT amused to find myself in 5 minute sleet storm. At least it was still warm enough to melt right away.
911756,lew,2015-04-22 22:22:00,12766,"Watching this evenings news it seems like the snow was kind of wide spread around Ontario.  Oh well, the long range forecast is looking pretty good for the next week or so.  I was just talking to friends in Arizona and they said it's 86 degrees down there."
911757,manitoubass2,2015-04-22 22:23:00,11391,"Haha we were in the 20s for a few weeks. Even hit the golf course last saturday.  Then 3"" of snow and -10.  Hahaha I love Canada!"
911761,lew,2015-04-22 22:29:00,12766,"Then 3"" of snow and -10.    I don't feel so bad now  LOL"
911762,ketchenany,2015-04-22 22:33:00,3229,Me too! At 5:30 7 and Weston Road.
911764,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-22 22:45:00,8243,"When I pulled in the driveway here on the Erie shoreline I was witness to flurries. It's only April 22nd, (Dad's 88th Bday), we have had snow that stayed for a bit on many Victoria Day weekends over the years. One Victoria Day weekend  I camped out of the 20 foot plus long 1970 Mercury Marquis Brougham and woke to find an inch on the beast, suntan lotion in the afternoon on Wasaga Beach. That boat of a car was bigger than some hotel rooms I've been in.  Hey catpierre those don't look like weeds to me. MY wife racked the garden out on Sunday and pulled all my Purple Violettes out, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. I was told by a pro landscaper BIL to leave leaves in the garden until the 1st of May. Stay out of my boat honey and leave my gardens alone."
912015,netminder,2015-04-23 23:49:00,514,West of Orangeville on 109 there was a line of about 9 tractor trailers that couldn't make it up the hill out of town this morning. Too much ice
912072,misfish,2015-04-24 10:29:00,29133,"Open the door this morning Lew, only to see it snowing. 1"" on the ground.  Funny how loud the Cardinals love music was as well. Many of them singing away."
912073,lew,2015-04-24 10:35:00,12766,"TV says your gonna get 2"" today Brian...glad I'm not there  As for the Cardinals, I have 2 on the feeder as we speak and your right, they sure are nice to listen to."
912074,BillM,2015-04-24 11:33:00,17367,It feels weird to be pulling the boat down to Lake O this weekend with all this white stuff on the ground!
912078,Sinker,2015-04-24 12:02:00,8692,I knew when I put the snowbrush and shovels away this would happen. Sorry folks!
912079,Sinker,2015-04-24 12:03:00,8692,I knew when I put the snowbrush and shovels away this would happen. Sorry folks!
912086,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-24 12:42:00,8243,So it was you Sinker!
912095,manitoubass2,2015-04-24 13:47:00,11391,Well back to +10 yesterday lol. Nice enough to go hit some golf balls?  +10 and rain today. I hope it downpours
