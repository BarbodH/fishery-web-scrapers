It's this Friday,Saturday ,and Sunday. He's stocked up pretty good, a little light on the Muskie tackle but overall pretty decent. I'm not trying to advertise for him, just wanted to let any kawartha guys or gals know there's a sale. I was in last week and was going to pick up some tackle and he was decent enough to tell me for the amount of stuff I was picking up to come in this weekend and save a bit of cash."
912042,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-24 01:34:00,2582,Out of my way...but the one time I was in there I was impressed. Thx for the heads up. I'm sure anyone in the area that fishes will make a trip over if they need anything.
