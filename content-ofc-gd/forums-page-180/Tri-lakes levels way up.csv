911579,captpierre,2015-04-22 02:04:00,2521,Just looked at the Trent system water levels. Tri-lakes way up last 5 days. Now normal average levels.  Needed to have faith.   Was worried for nothin
911594,fishnsled,2015-04-22 04:13:00,3520,"And flood warnings for the Parry Sound and Muskoka region.  There are flooding concerns in the Muskoka Region a day after heavy rains pounded the area. Ontarioâ€™s Ministry of Natural Resources has issued a flood watch for Muskoka, Parry Sound and a north-west portion of Haliburton County. The MNR says water flow at area lakes and rivers continue to climb due to the rainfall received on Monday, and the continued melting of the snow pack.  http://barrie.ctvnews.ca/flood-watch-issued-for-muskoka-region-parry-sound-1.2337661"
911595,pics,2015-04-22 04:43:00,1268,Whoever made the call did the right thing.. but only because of good luck maybe... a dry spring and it could have been a different story... the Niagara conservation authority tries to do the same predictions but on a much smaller scale and with bad results in a.lot of cases..
911602,fishindevil,2015-04-22 08:38:00,6254,By way up you mean summer water levels ??? Lol ....
911604,musky666,2015-04-22 10:11:00,126,Balsam had risen dramatically as of this past Saturday...
911606,singingdog,2015-04-22 10:25:00,1047,"By way up you mean summer water levels ??? Lol .... Scugog is above normal levels, waaay above summer levels, Buckhorn is almost at normal seasonal level, Balsam is quite a bit above normal seasonal levels. Still believe the guys can't find their way to work?"
911612,lew,2015-04-22 11:19:00,12766,"I drove along the Otonabee River south of Lakefield yesterday and parts of the river are still low while other sections are about normal. Looks like their adjusting the water flows between the dams to get everything regulated.  For anyone that doesn't know, the river runs between Lake Katchawanooka at Lakefield and Rice Lake and for the most part is only a couple hundred feet wide. Basically, the entire Trent system has to be funnelled through this narrow river into Rice Lake and eventually into the Bay of Quinte and personally, I think the guys normally do a pretty darned good job of regulating it. If they let too much water through they flood everything below Lakefield and if they hold it back, there's flooding in the northern lakes.  If they flood the northern lakes, their told their doing a lousy job of regulating the flow, and if they flood the southern part, their told their doing a lousy of regulating the flow.  Sort of a lose lose job if you ask me."

911617,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-22 12:04:00,2582,Two board members have let me know that one of my fav spring spots on Pidgeon for crappie and gills is low but fishable.  That's all I wanted to hear. When I was up that way Good Friday I was pretty sure it wasn't going to happen. May 1st cottage move in date can't come soon enough now.
911649,John Bacon,2015-04-22 15:30:00,3277,a dry spring and it could have been a different story  Hasn't this been a dry spring?  I don't recall any significant rain fall prior to this week.  I would guess that pricipitation for the season is still below normal.
911833,fishboy,2015-04-23 04:19:00,550,"The Gull watershed lakes at the bottom end are now at or above the historic seasonal average, and the upper ones are still on the rise and are above the historic lows for this time of year."
911949,Tom McCutcheon,2015-04-23 17:41:00,627,"The water must have come from the non existent snow pack in the north part of the watershed.  A lot of worry about nothing. To me, Parks Canada finally got it right. Walleye eggs were not left high and dry and most folks did not need to worry about flooding."
911988,SuperDave,2015-04-23 21:17:00,204,As long as theres enough water to get my new boat near your dock Tom.
912003,Tom McCutcheon,2015-04-23 22:48:00,627,"Oh you'll be able to get near the dock Dave, just not sure if two ""Henrietta Chicken"" bumpers will be enough......"
