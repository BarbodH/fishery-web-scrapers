911217,codered,2015-04-20 16:11:00,123, Hey guys im getting primed for a walleye opener weekend . has any one  here fished mackavoy lake or the one to the north for walleye and pike? I have been looking for topo maps of a few lakes up the area with little luck . i have fished story lake in cloyne and a lake located past the Irvine airstrip with not much luck ecept for bass . mazinaw has been ok for me aswell but was looking for something new close by mazinaw. thx
