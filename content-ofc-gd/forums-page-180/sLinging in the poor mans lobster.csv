910981,Joeytier,2015-04-19 17:25:00,3990,"Well, the only open water around here is the Ottawa riv, and with it still being at winter levels (about 10 feet down) it was a nice easy walk to where we suspected we'd find the fish.  We fished from 10-1 with salties on the bottom and had a blast reeling in ling one after another while we kept the fire stoked and the mugs full.  Was awesome to use a long rod again for the first time in too long and the fish fry tonight will be epic!  "
