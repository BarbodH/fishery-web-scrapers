909901,Sinker,2015-04-13 20:19:00,8692,"Finished off 5L last night. Pulled taps and cleaned everything up. Not sure how next year will be, we're moving and dont have the maples there. Going to have to find a few trees to tap now.  I think I finished about 16l this year. No monster runs like other years, slow and steady.  S."
909904,Rod Caster,2015-04-13 20:43:00,5784,16l is more than enough syrup for a family for one year... although I bet you give a bunch away!  You have any birch where you are moving? Maybe try making birch syrup.  My trees ran strong again today.
909910,Sinker,2015-04-13 21:16:00,8692,"I have access to a few bushs around, its just a matter of finding the most convenient one with the best access.  I did birch a few years ago, just one tree. Its different than maple for sure, and the yeild is crazy low. Hardly worth it IMO.  S."
911104,Rod Caster,2015-04-20 02:10:00,5784,"With the rain coming this week, I'd say my season is over. Today I had another good run and I'm right now boiling down some dark syrup, maybe 2-3L worth.  My total will be approx. 8L for 17 taps. Not bad, not great. Some trees produced extremely well and others were essentially duds. Next year I hope to double my tree count and aim for 20L of syrup.  For this summer I'll be tending to my maple forest, creating trails, a proper fire pit (concrete or blocks maybe),  thinning out trees and applying forest management techniques.  Maple syrup season makes you appreciate winter, without it, there would be no sap runs!"
911122,Sinker,2015-04-20 02:59:00,8692,"If you have a south facing slope, set up some lines. Its the best way to go. I have the slope, but its facing the wrong way, and my lines kept freezing up, so the buckets were the best way to go.  It wasn't a great run this year, but we have no control over it, and its always interesting.  S."

Discussing with my buddy, we were thinking of using tubing for a few clusters and  then buckets for the rest. Good point about the freezing-up, I really didn't consider that.  I just jarred the last 2.75L of dark syrup for 2015! Is it a good idea to take maple shots just before bed??  edit: once I get a chance to upload the million photos I took this month I'll post photos of my season."
911615,Rod Caster,2015-04-22 11:47:00,5784,TJ!! (how do you yell on this thing) How'd you make out this season??? I've been checking your maple syrup site for updates. Hope everything has gone well since your last update.
907674,Beavertail,2015-04-02 14:48:00,331,"TJ, that looks like a slick system. Rodcaster, good idea with the wire. My spiles are leaking a bit too(made the holes a bit big I think - next year will be better) so I might add some wire too."
907676,Beavertail,2015-04-02 14:49:00,331,I'm also getting the boat out of storage today...getting wafts of maple scent in the garage while I work - God I love spring!
907677,TJQ,2015-04-02 14:52:00,7806,"This tap leaked a lot, so I hung this little wire and it now drips into the bucket.    Very interesting idea."
907770,SmokestackLightnin,2015-04-02 22:48:00,390,"Well that's it, third boil is complete and all cleaned up.  The syrup is definitely amber and very good.  We have collected another 250 litres of sap and will only need 100 more for the fourth and final boil.  Now to get packed and get my sorry butt on a jet plane for 7am takeoff from Pearson tomorrow morning."
907989,Rod Caster,2015-04-03 23:16:00,5784,"It was nice today, +5 and partial sun, but the sap still won't drop. I'm starting to think that the deep snow around the trunks is keeping the sap low.  It's going to -14 tonight, so I'll check again on Monday or Tuesday."
908066,Beavertail,2015-04-04 15:47:00,331,So I'm boiling my second batch today and noticed one 5gal pail is slightly cloudy...is it still ok to use?
908346,castgame,2015-04-06 15:08:00,161,"this may have been discussed already, but help me settle a dispute with a friend: do you boil the ice in the pail that forms overnight, or do you toss it aside because it has much less sugar than the liquid sap?"

908373,TJQ,2015-04-06 17:07:00,7806,I boil everything.... slow here as well...
908388,Beavertail,2015-04-06 18:43:00,331,"Well, to say I'm pleased and surprised with this season so far (my first to boot) would be an understatement. The four maples on my property have produced 3.75L of delicious, amber coloured sap. Have one more small batch to boil I think, before the season is over. I always knew how much time was involved to make syrup but now I truly appreciate exactly how much work is involved. Looking forward to the upcoming seasons and refining my little operation!"
908450,Rod Caster,2015-04-07 00:14:00,5784,"3.5L from 4 trees is a great return! Nice work!  It barely climbed over +1 degrees, but nearly all my trees were dripping this evening.They want to run pretty bad... otherwise like TJ said, it's been cold here.  Can't wait to read your updates when the sap starts flowing TJ!"
908733,Rod Caster,2015-04-08 02:12:00,5784,"Today was good, but some trees are still silent Seems that sun exposure makes a huge difference. I'll boil my first batch tomorrow"

Not a drop of rain all week, beauty beach, nice breeze and all the booze and food I could handle!  EDIT: 170 litres for the week. Not as great as I was hoping, but 4 more litres of syrup at least. That willl put me at around 16 litres of syrup. Not bad, but not great. I usually get closer to a litre per tap....25 taps. Looks like its done here now.  S."

Only collected 20L so far (17 taps) and things may shut down over the next couple days... Some trees haven't even started yet. Saturday and Sunday look like nice days but after that it may be too warm. My new, reduced goal is 5L."
909199,Rod Caster,2015-04-10 03:21:00,5784,"Boiled my first litre tonight... Hardly worth the effort , but I wanted a batch of the early stuff.  Took approximately 25L of sap to get nearly 1L of syrup... I'm happy with that ratio!!"

I screwed up 2 yrs ago and didn't get up and go to the local farmer's market on Saturday morning to get the maple sugar. So, on the Monday, I stopped at a pretty fancy sugar bush shop that I knew would have some for sale. I asked for a 24ozs and she said here and gave me 6 X 4oz bags at 6.99 each I was too embarrassed to refuse because the price was about triple what I was used to paying LOL."

Im considering thawing my buckets enough to get the solid chunks out, letting it skim over in the pan, and skimming off the ice for the next few days, but its a lot of screwing around to thaw them out. I have a few buckets that are going to overflow when it starts running that i'd like to empty at the very least. We'll see how ambitious I am over the next couple days.

907259,KLINKER,2015-03-31 16:09:00,256,"Back when I helped my Uncle do sap we would gather the sap and dump the ice or if it was in the pails too long we just dump them ready for the next run.  In the old sap house he had one big evaporator that ran close to if not 24hr a day, when he moved up by the road he had two big evaporators and two 1,000 gal holding tanks. Occasionally in the old shack with nobody around and that big fire going he would fall asleep and burn out the bottom out of the pan requiring a spare. The sap would go into the back corner of the back pan (about 12X 5 or 6) and as the new sap came in it would push the hot sap out the opposite corner into the front pan (about   6x6) . In the opposite corner there is a thermometer and when it gets up to temp you take off the syrup there. We tapped 4 woodlots, all buckets. We would fill the holding tanks and two gathering tanks so he must have had least thousand taps maybe two.  Best guy to work with in the woods was Mum's Uncle, He taught me how to work with a gang and he was the last one to use horses. I remember the horses but I couldn't have been very old then."

904224,lakerguy,2015-03-17 21:59:00,224,If there sugar maples you can probably count on close to 1L per tap of maple syrup. Could be less could be more. Depends on how fast spring comes in. If the temps start staying above freezing and the days get real warm the tree starts using that sap up for the buds and the sap quality goes down hill fast.
904228,lakerguy,2015-03-17 22:10:00,224,Get yourself some taps and buckets and make some syrup!  It's very rewarding knowing you made it. There's enough of us on here to give you some advice gladly.

He also made a cart with a shelf for the burner and wheels.  Although you're not moving it when it's full of sap.  Doesn't matter what you use, there are setups from people on here that look awesome.  What matters is you're doing something that has been done for numerous generations and you're getting the satisfaction in the end that you made it yourself.  When I first started I had a few kids ""help"" out and they enjoyed the experience.  These same kids are now 14 - 18 years old and they call me each spring and ask when are we tapping trees and when are we boiling."

I kind of 'winged' it by using the largest drill bit I had, but it's not really the proper size. I assume that my holes are either too big of too small, or even too deep...?? Should I stop being a cheap bugger and buy a dedicated bit? What size?"

(let's keep this clean)  I was considering getting some tubing off a friend who has extra stuff, and doing a two or three tap system for some of my bigger/better trees, into a bigger pale.  I had a bit of liquid in one of my buckets today, tasted like melt-water, was likely melt-water haha."
902669,Sinker,2015-03-10 13:43:00,8692,"I double tap most of my trees, but im only tapping the biggest ones for doubles. I tend to tap 8 smaller ones along my driveway that produce earlier than the big ones, but the big doubles produce a lot more once it really starts flowing.  I wish I could post pics here from my phone!  S."
902696,BillM,2015-03-10 16:09:00,17367,What's the ratio of sap out of the tree to syrup in the bottle?   I am extremely jealous of some of you!
902697,gaspumper,2015-03-10 16:28:00,393,40 gal sap = 1 gal syrup.
902734,SmokestackLightnin,2015-03-10 21:19:00,390,"Yes, some trees are double tapped.  I will likely put in 10 more taps before the weekend.  It's running slowly today, only 5 gallons of sap collected today."
902756,Sinker,2015-03-10 22:41:00,8692,"I got 25L today from 25 taps. It ran kinda slow. A goodd sunny day and it will be game on!  Usual ratio is 40:1, but if you have good trees with big crowns in full sun you can do better. Some trees produce more sugar than others.  I set up my storage station and shoveled off my boiling station, so bring it on, im good to go.  S."

903607,lakerguy,2015-03-14 20:29:00,224,"     Couple pics of my rig. I think it's evaperating about 8gal/hr. if i crank the valves open fully she boils pretty good maybe up to 10 gph. I have a fire box too for it but when I'm working in the shop,the propane gets used. I built the lp unit by just bolting together 3 Martin turkey fryer burners that I picked up at Home Depot in the middle of winter a few yrs ago for 20 bucks each on a clearance sale. I made a little manifold for the supply. I have it plumbed into my under ground line coming off our lp supply for our chicken barns. I used to have the unit wrapped in ceramic blanket but it would starve for air and not burn as efficiently. That's why it looks so old,it's been hot a few times lol. I run it in a well vented building. When its cold out I just put the unit outside on the cement and let it boil away. We mostly just make batches. The pan can be continuous flow, but I don't lie standing beside it drawing off a cup every twenty minutes. When I have almost syrup I transfer it to a smaller 18""x18"" sq finishing pan where I can control the boil a bit better and finish it right."
903631,Sinker,2015-03-14 22:18:00,8692,Nice set up! Mine is boiling away now. Put 100L in my pan at 3:40. Started boiling in about 45 mins. We'll see what time I get done at. Should get aroundd 2.5L of syrup by midnight.   S.

Went to the cottage Saturday to close out walleye season and see if we entice a trout or two as well.  Well last night was a fantastic night on the ice and it was capped off by a beautiful sunset.  The fishing was great all weekend and we wound up keeping only 6, all males, biggest one was 3lbs.  The sap flowed well while we were gone and now we have 350 litres collected, boiling starts tomorrow.    "

I'm anticipating a busy Spring work-wise, so I started early and today I tapped 8 trees in a new location (denser maples), I have 4 more to tap and my goal is 10 litres of damn delicious maple syrup by the end of the season. It's only my second year making syrup and last year was a scramble, but I still managed 3 or 4 litres. This year I'm a bit more organized, and I have some good plans for next year!  A question I have for the more experienced :Are there any potential issues with tapping too early?    "
900850,Sinker,2015-03-02 00:53:00,8692,"I started tapping this week too. Sugar shack is cleaned up and ready to go. This will be the first year im ready early. No issues tapping early. A lot of the big sugar bushes start tapping in january.  It will be a couple weeks here by the looks of the weather, but better to be ready and get as much sap as you can.  Whats your set up?  I love sugar season!!!  S."

Agreed, I was worried about a short season like Mister G is expecting, so this might be the only way I can hit my target.  I have two propane boiling bases, a 1.5x3 Stainless container I found and converted as well as a lobster pot for the final boil. I'll be converting an oil tank to an evaporator this year and clearing an area for a small shack. One step at a time since I have like 200 projects on the go.

I'm not predicting anything. I'm always wrong LOL  I'm pretty much good to go. Just a few more trees to tap, and gear to clean. I just boil on a 2 x 2 flat pan over a propane burner. I do 80L of sap at a time. Takes forever!  Tapping in snowshoes is always fun too.  S."

It would be my first missed year in 11 years.  I have lots of stock so it may not be a huge concern.  If I can recruit a sap collector for a week then I will start tapping this coming weekend.
