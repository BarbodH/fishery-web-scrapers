912191,Fisherpete,2015-04-24 22:24:00,1814,Hopefully not the power supply in the unit... my LCD tv acted like that when the power supply went in it.  Have you checked the fuse? (assuming it has an inline fuse)
912200,ccmtcanada,2015-04-24 23:11:00,7971,What humminbird model do you have?  If it's a 581i you can borrow mine and see if that powers up. Or bring yours to me and I can test it.  Even if it's not the same model it could work if the power supply cables are the same. Either way works for me.
912337,sneak_e_pete,2015-04-25 21:37:00,540,Ccmt...what a kind offer!  Actually visited a local marina and tested a new power cord...it worked!
912345,ecmilley,2015-04-25 22:24:00,2163,Well check power at connection with a test light/meter but sounds like your bird is done. Happened on my hds8 last year power supply issue.  Now have a gen 2 hds
912348,ccmtcanada,2015-04-25 22:48:00,7971,Glad you got it figured out!
