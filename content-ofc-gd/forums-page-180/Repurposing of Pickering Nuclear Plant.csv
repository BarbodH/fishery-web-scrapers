912077,NAC,2015-04-24 11:57:00,369,"So much for the winter fishery there.  That was my real concern too. The Bruce successfully rebuilt by decomissioning on reactor at a time, no reason Pickering can't and shouldn't. That's going to be a huge hit for all those families who make a great living working there."
912100,SirCranksalot,2015-04-24 14:36:00,3291,", no reason Pickering can't and shouldn't.  The big reason was economics. Costs could not be justified."
912197,Steve,2015-04-24 22:54:00,2075,they'll refurb reactor B at Bruce before rebuilding another OPG plant .
912207,bigugli,2015-04-24 23:34:00,6138,  Bruce reactors don't have 1 million people living in close proximity to the facility.
911554,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-22 00:39:00,10439,Is there anything out there to suggest that there even is radioactive contamination on site?    
911561,manitoubass2,2015-04-22 00:52:00,11391,Nice rack on that bunny!  Perhaps it should be turned into jurasic park?
911566,Canuck2fan,2015-04-22 01:11:00,1444,I hear plans for a massive tourist attraction there will be  1) Megalodon fishing at your own risk in a special built enclosure just offshore out front....  2) Hunting for Wooly Mammoth in the parking area...  while you are waiting to launch bow and spear only though.  Not confirmed but officials hope Godzilla will be make an eventual appearance.  It would be interesting to see who gets the contract to assay the soils and building materials.
911611,Garnet,2015-04-22 11:15:00,2056,Just a few morons having there fun.  A child could play inside for there life and never be exposed to more radiation than your house. The places were a child could be exposed are controlled like fort knox everybody signs off on everything. You can't take a paper clip with you. You are tested going in and out of these areas.  You are tested and then shower before you put your street clothes to leave Mandatory.
911616,Burtess,2015-04-22 11:51:00,901,They should make it a Northern White Rhino breeding reserve.......  Burt

911625,KLINKER,2015-04-22 13:10:00,256,Wouldn't it make sense to eventually rebuild it on the same site?
911644,Headhunter,2015-04-22 15:19:00,5703,"In order to either re-build it or re-furbish, Uncle Katy would have to sell off half of Lake Ontario! (don't give her any ideas!) I vote laser doom! Day time, laser tag... night time laser rock under the dome! HH"
911646,Headhunter,2015-04-22 15:22:00,5703,"On a serious note, isn't the reactor at Chalk River way past it's life expectancy? I'm certainly not an expert, but couldn't Pickering be converted to develop medical isotopes? There sure aren't many left in the world. HH"
911666,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-22 16:41:00,10439,"Maybe ISIS, Iraq or Iran will purchase it for a dirty bomb material making plant."

When the site first opened, Courtice was a dozen houses and a general store on a crossroads straddling Hwy #2.

The Pickering plant is located just outside of Toronto.  The Pickering location is even more built up than Darlington.  But the way I look at it, if residends complain about a new plant in there neighbourhood just point out that there was already one there when they bought their house."
912075,bigugli,2015-04-24 11:39:00,6138," Yes, they are 2 plants, but the urban sprawl runs clear across from the Rouge straight across. I just used the most blatant example of sprawl in the area. Used to shoot goose tween Taunton rd and the conservation area, long before the first real surge of urban sprawl."
912076,Garnet,2015-04-24 11:44:00,2056,Nice new bridge sitting across the road from the farm I grew up on just west of Whitby on Hwy 2. Use to shot jack rabbits.  And trapped pheasants on Garden St. in Whitby it was a gravel rd.

Seems strange I was under the impression aside from the nuclear waste viewpoint going to the depths of the oceans it was a pretty clean form of energy  Nothing to do with waste, they are just getting old.   They've got a lifespan like everything else for the most part.  I'm all for nuclear energy, I'd like to see a few more plants pop up to be honest."

911440,Rod Caster,2015-04-21 16:49:00,5784,"Yep, full barrels of green goo a foot beneath some clay..haha  Not a 'bunch', that's an exaggeration, but yes, if there is in fact any significant radioactive soil contamination (which I kind of doubt there is), that site will never be returned to pristine conditions.  There is a difference between full (background) remediation and remedial effort. Just saying, most remediations are not 'Full' remediations."

911449,John Bacon,2015-04-21 17:24:00,3277,(Since they are screwing up the other launch at Frenchman's)  Are you referring to the launch on the west side of Frenchman's?  Aren't they planning to improve that one?

They are but it is a single use launch, looks like it maybe gated in the drawings?  I tried to launch once at the gated launch on the east side once and there was no one there to unlock the gate.   Haven't been back there since.   Maybe the new launch will be fine but I'm having my doubts with the single launch and limited parking.  There was a chance to improve it but I think they may have missed the mark.  Edit - link to the plans.  http://www.pickering.ca/en/discovering/resources/FBW_Masterplan.pdf"
