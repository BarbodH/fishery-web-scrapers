909117,ecmilley,2015-04-09 19:52:00,2163,"they took a couple logs out of the dam today in lindsay river was up at least two feet looks nothing like it did earlier in the week its all water shore to lock now, this outta help blow out the river and bea good start to breaking up goose"
909129,manjo39,2015-04-09 20:45:00,354,Good news.  Thanks for the update.
909133,linweir,2015-04-09 21:08:00,202,Cameron Lake is so low at the Rosedale end I can't put my boat in yet. How about Fenelon Fall side? Plan to launch my boat there.
909151,esoxansteel,2015-04-09 23:01:00,1307,"Went for a short drive to check out 2 spots I fish for Gills and Crappies, both were mud, with no water what so ever, even the creek arm that dumps into it wasn't flowing, and im off tomorrow so I guess I will be tying softball size roebags with 8 rattles per bag LOL, unless I can find some clear lake water, wait 50 to 80 km winds, not very likely"
909154,Sinker,2015-04-09 23:14:00,8692,I wonder how low they will drop scugog now? What a mess this is going to be.  S.
909156,SirWhite,2015-04-09 23:23:00,210,"Ummm, isn't the Trent system man made? As in the lakes didn't connect through a river that can be traversed by boat?"
909161,Sinker,2015-04-09 23:34:00,8692,"The trent severn waterway is indeed man-made, but there has always been a watershed there. At one time atlaantic salmon could run all the way up to what is now balsam lake.  S."
909236,Paudash,2015-04-10 13:11:00,273,with all the rain last night I hope it helped
909266,aznphil,2015-04-10 15:06:00,73,"could it be that the past several years the flooding has been excessive, and the water engineers think they can be smart by pulling the plug earlier this year to prevent flooding?"
909339,Big Cliff,2015-04-10 23:59:00,6899,"Going to be a very interesting year, the ice is desolving very quickly perhaps because of the rain and wind. Three days ago I'd have walked across the lake here, today I wouldn't step off the shore."
909380,fishermccann,2015-04-11 12:39:00,655,"There was no water going over the Rosedale dam , from Balsam into Cameron, none, yesterday/Saturday. Balsam was 3 feet higher than Cameron."
909747,ecmilley,2015-04-12 23:53:00,2163,"The spawn is on, this week they have managed to bring sturgeon up about 2 ft it has broken up the ice for 20-30 ft of shoreline around my house and this afternoonwas whatchin the walleyes swim up lookin for a female then swim back under the ice, hopefully water levels stay consistent over the next 10-14 days so the eggs have a chance"
912256,fishermccann,2015-04-25 02:19:00,655,"Close to normal water levels at the Rosedale end of Cameron now, water over the dam and all. Good enough to put the pontoon  boat in the water this coming week."
908030,ecmilley,2015-04-04 12:13:00,2163,beans there has a couple pics of pigeon heres a couple from locks in Lindsay.   
908033,captpierre,2015-04-04 12:31:00,2521,Stupid low. Pigeon is way low too. They have allowed for huge spring runoff that is not going to happen this year. How will this affect the walleye spawn?
908034,ecmilley,2015-04-04 12:35:00,2163,"Stupid low. Pigeon is way low too. They have allowed for huge spring runoff that is not going to happen this year. How will this affect the walleye spawn? i am the optimist, i figure they cant lower it anymore to expose the eggs"
908052,Beans,2015-04-04 14:27:00,3339,"It was too muddy to take a picture at the launch, of the lagoon where we park our boats...seemed strange to see the docks high and dry with no water underneath...  Where is the water that they are holding back ?"
908053,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-04 14:32:00,2582,Those picture are ridiculous. I have never seen it that low this time of year. Might have to find a few new crappie/bluegill spots this spring....the usual spots might not have any water
908166,fishindevil,2015-04-05 07:51:00,6254,
908167,fishindevil,2015-04-05 07:53:00,6254,This is at the dam in bobcaygeon where the walleyes will be in a week or so !!!! Eggs high & dry as usual !!! They are 1 inch away from historic low level !!!! I have fired off emails to parks canada and Trent Severn water goons !!!!! Same crap all the time !!!! I have been the only one who noticed it all winter long it's ridiculous
908168,fishindevil,2015-04-05 07:56:00,6254,
908169,fishindevil,2015-04-05 07:57:00,6254,You can walk right up to the base of the dam and touch it ???? It's bad for sure !!!!! Never ever seen it this low !!!!!! Every year they get worse at water management that's for sure !!! It just kept dropping all winter more & more & more !!!! (
908175,moxie,2015-04-05 13:02:00,1566,Tax dollars hard at work. Just think. hiring monkeys would only cost us Bananas.  Well at least there wont be a repeat of flooding in other years. We all know how people living in flood prone areas get when they have to deal with flooding.
908178,Big Cliff,2015-04-05 13:28:00,6899,"Good news is that the walleye haven't started their spring spawning yet, most years they drop the water levels after the walleye spawn and leave the eggs high and dry. Sturgeon Lake is just starting to show some signs of open water in the current areas, I'm thinking ice out here in about another 2-3 weeks at least. There is still plenty of ice on the Scugog River as of yesterday and only a small area of open water down by Lunge Haven for those that know the area.  Many of those that draw water from the lake are having problems, with the water level so low, many of the water lines have frozen solid. Friends of ours down the road have been without running water for the last two months!  I would guess though that the water management job must be a really tough one, you just aren't going to please everyone no matter what you do. Keep the water levels high and run the risk of flooding out a lot of people and causing millions in damages. Drop it too low and people are running out of water and you are affecting wildlife.... Tough job, glad I don't have to do it!"
908180,landry,2015-04-05 13:37:00,1005,"That looks bad. However, if the walleye can still get up at least their eggs will not be high and dry as water levels should actually rise."
908182,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-05 13:55:00,2582,Thx for posting those pictures of Caygeon Fishindevil. We where there yesterday and I was stunned at what I saw. I have never seen it even close to that low. Not sure how it will effect the fish....but I see a lot of human problems with the levels being this low.
908183,manjo39,2015-04-05 14:06:00,354,Thanks Cliff. Trying to plan what weekend to put the dock in and your reports help. And I agree water level management can't be an easy job.
908242,lew,2015-04-05 18:38:00,12766,I took a couple pictures at Burliegh Falls this morning to show how low the water is compared to the same place last spring.  Last year...        Same place this morning...      
908244,fishindevil,2015-04-05 18:46:00,6254,Nice shots Lew !!! I have some from last year too but it's the lowest I have ever seen it and I was arguing with parks canada about it !!!! They have no clue ..... I call them the Trent Severn water goons !!!! Controlled by a switch and a key board click in Toronto !!!!! They dropped it all winter continuously and yes peoples water lines are frozen and dry as well as damage from low water it will rise yes but not in the way it should and not natural man has screwed it up again !!! Everyear they make it worse & worse !!!!!
908245,Big Cliff,2015-04-05 18:49:00,6899,"Thanks Cliff. Trying to plan what weekend to put the dock in and your reports help. And I agree water level management can't be an easy job. Paul, anytime you need detailed information, pictures, anything, just let me know and when the time comes to do the dock thing, I would be more than happy to lend a hand!  Got the float from Sinker, I would think it will be a lot of help and I am going over to Patric's Tire on Tuesday to get some tubes. I also have some VERY heavy duty ratchet straps and I am going to be buying a barn jack this week. If I have it and you need it, it's yours! (that goes for anything but the dog and the wife and the wife is negotiatable  ) (don't tell the dog, it will go to her head)."
908252,Fisherman,2015-04-05 19:00:00,7201,"I dunno, dammed if you do, dammed if you don't.  How did it work before all the locks were put in place.  Was there an annual flood or did things run according to nature."
908293,manjo39,2015-04-06 00:48:00,354,Lol.  I'll call you soon for the tire tubes.   Thanks.
908423,ecmilley,2015-04-06 22:22:00,2163,"Stopped at the dam, good news is water is rising maybe 3 inces from the pics i previously took, no fish seen not even a perch, several days of rain and warm temps coming though."
908587,ecmilley,2015-04-07 16:52:00,2163,the canal at pleasant point.  last year had my ranger parked right were the snow was.  dam on little bob channel today.  that rocky point is usually in the water.
908609,manjo39,2015-04-07 17:55:00,354,Thanks for the pictures Ernie.  Interesting to see.
908782,fishermccann,2015-04-08 11:53:00,655,Cameron Lake is so low at the Rosedale end I can't put my boat in yet.
908861,Paudash,2015-04-08 17:42:00,273,hope this rain today helps but I think we need a week of it before we see any real difference
908905,Sinker,2015-04-08 21:45:00,8692,"what the hell??? Ive never seen levels that low, and theres not much to melt!!  S."
