911072,captpierre,2015-04-20 00:03:00,2521,No seriously.  Been wondering if we should buy tickets to some events.  Anybody thinking the same?  Which events!
911074,kickingfrog,2015-04-20 00:23:00,8333,I've always loved the bike racing in the velodrome.
911078,grizzlybri,2015-04-20 00:40:00,565,"I've always loved the bike racing in the velodrome.  I'm right outside of Milton and that venue has been crazy busy since they had their grand opening.  However if i do go to any of the events I'd either go the the BMX park or go watch the Marathon, being a runner myself"
911090,John Bacon,2015-04-20 01:17:00,3277,Some of the events are in Toronto Harbour.  You could watch them while fishing.
911091,Acountdeleted,2015-04-20 01:17:00,2562,The only ticket I'll be buying is one for a train out of town. Traffic is bad enough in this city.
911095,fishing n autograph,2015-04-20 01:25:00,2540,I'll be working it
911102,Paudash,2015-04-20 01:57:00,273,No worries for tickets because nobody is coming.  All the A list athletes are going to the Olympic qualifier for track and field the week before  the Toronto games and for the water events world championships the week after in Russia so no swimmers or divers are coming.  Family and friends do not even go to the Pan am games  3 months  before the games start and still lots  tickets available for all events including the opening and closing ceremonies what a joke. Hotels are starting to discount rates because people are staying away because of the games. When all is said and done this is going to make the 76 Olympics in Montreal look like a very well run show.  None of the Pan am events are considered as Olympic qualifiers so the best athletes will be at those events instead  coming here.  Wait another month and they will be giving tickets away to paper the house  My grand kids will be paying for this joke
911177,creditmaster,2015-04-20 13:53:00,190,The equestrian events are my personal fav
911185,ketchenany,2015-04-20 14:23:00,3229,"I'll be working it So am I! Done ads for bus shelters, bilboards and now a book, with info on where to eat shop and  . . .  should go to print next month!"

911409,fishing n autograph,2015-04-21 14:18:00,2540,Not sure what I'll be doing. Ton of hours to fill doing security and team escorts etc
911435,Headhunter,2015-04-21 16:31:00,5703,The one thing you can be sure you will be doing FnA is cashing a great big throbbing cheque! LOL HH
911439,fishing n autograph,2015-04-21 16:41:00,2540,Someone's gotta do it!  I'm only doing it because I'm moving into a new house in June
911708,icedude,2015-04-22 19:17:00,459,"You're right, someone 'gots to do it'  Maybe you'll be on the Police 'Sunshine List' next year my friendly  Congrats on the new house dude  Cheers     ID1"
