911255,BillM,2015-04-20 18:26:00,17367,"I remember some monster browns always on the leaderboard when I used to fish the St.Catharunes Game and Fish derby as a kid with the oldman.,"
911256,AKRISONER,2015-04-20 18:46:00,5558,"hopefully I can get into something Saturday, Bill's convinced me to give err the old shot.  Never caught a brown in my life, so it should be interesting."
911273,fishnsled,2015-04-20 20:37:00,3520,"Awesome afternoon on the water!!  Warmth and a bunch of fish in April, tough to beat that!"
911307,Steve,2015-04-20 23:18:00,2075,"i've been lucky enough to be shown the photo of the 30lbs brown caught over easter weekend.  i'm not going to comment on the size in the photo, because photo's can be deceiving, but the fish was massive....by far the biggest brown i've seen since our big one in 2011.  it does look as big, if not bigger, than our 24.5lbs brown.  there are some big browns on our side (the US side, all the browns get kept and eaten, but at least on our side, they seem to get released....now if steelhead anglers could stop raping the females for eggs....we'd really see some big browns)."
911331,BillM,2015-04-21 00:52:00,17367,You'd see more and more big browns if they actually had food to eat and a place to spawn.
911338,Steve,2015-04-21 01:13:00,2075,"well, browns are prolific feeders...they eat a wide variety of food sources.  but yes, more spawning grounds would be great.....so would allowing them to spawn at current spawning area's without .... well .... nevermind"
911341,BillM,2015-04-21 01:17:00,17367,Without getting pinned up on the kill boards by the charter guys?  I thought that's what you were going to say  :)
911343,Steve,2015-04-21 01:18:00,2075,
911346,BillM,2015-04-21 01:21:00,17367,"I'm glad we're both getting a laugh out of this, lol!   If you see a white Lund off Weller this weekend, give me a wave    I'm hoping to get the gf into some greasy lake trout.  Some bonus browns would be great as well (Although I don't know if I'm going to haul down the planner boards/mast)"
911347,Steve,2015-04-21 01:28:00,2075,You have a PM.
910824,Steve,2015-04-18 17:08:00,2075,"As the Kings slowly (and I mean slooooowly) trickle in, the crowds are building much quicker than the volume of fish is.I took the day off work, dropped the wife off at work for 8am, then headed down to Jordan. Launched by 8:45 am and by noon I hadn't moved a rod, next to three coho that were the size of the bomber long A I was pulling. At noon I had to make a decision, continue to work the water with the 50 other boats, maybe for one or two fish, or pull the boat and move to a different port.Heading back home I veered off the QEW and launched. With only four trailers in the lot, I knew the lake would be quieter. No idea what the water colour would be like, but it had to better than the ole skunk I had out of Jordan.Went out of port and found slightly colder (46 degrees instead of 49 degrees at Jordan), and little colour. I headed in tight, set up a long line pulling a ripplin redfin, and a inline pulling a bomber long A.  Spent the next 6 hours having a blast, fishing solo, and pounding on browns and lakers. Using light bass tackle, fishing shallow water, is my favourite thing to do on Lake Ontario. Best part was, it was the middle of the afternoon. Sun was shining. Lake was flat. What a way to enjoy a beautiful spring day.        Couple true double headers.      Last fish of the afternoon. Snaky Laker.    T Shirts and Sandals in April. Woohoo!!"
910827,kickingfrog,2015-04-18 17:33:00,8333,Took a break from raking/yard work/garage cleaning to see this. Nice fish
910828,Joeytier,2015-04-18 18:00:00,3990,Yup that's an awesome day of spring fishing!
910830,Steve,2015-04-18 18:18:00,2075,"I tell ya, I can go for this afternoon fishing, lol.  5am is totally overrated."
910844,kenzy31,2015-04-18 20:37:00,261,^^ yup I just did the same lol Nice fish! Good call on the location change
910845,jbailey,2015-04-18 20:51:00,866,beautiful! I'm trying to get the boat out of the garage so I can get me some of those

910977,LostAnotherOne,2015-04-19 16:36:00,956,Well done Steve.  You always find the big ones.
910995,ckewley,2015-04-19 18:21:00,699,"Those pictures are incredible, amazing detail!!! Oh & the fish aren't half bad either (jealous big time)"

911043,dave524,2015-04-19 21:14:00,4508,"it was a great time out there...  with the winds screwing everything up today, not sure how much longer they will stay in the shallows....  but they sure are fun when they are in tight.  You'd be surprised how late ( mid June ) I've caught Browns shore casting , off shore winds help.  Great looking day on the water and nice fish"
911047,BillM,2015-04-19 22:03:00,17367,"Nice fish!  First Lake O trip of the year is scheduled for next weekend, can't wait!"
911162,Headhunter,2015-04-20 12:58:00,5703,Great pics Steve! Solo with that kind of action must have been a blast! Congrats! HH
911194,Mike Pike,2015-04-20 15:06:00,1332,"Nice job, Steve.  You adapted and suceeded.  Real nice colours on the trouties too, and some nic pics to remember 'em by."
911229,AKRISONER,2015-04-20 16:31:00,5558,"ive wanted to fish those shallows of jordan for a while, my girlfriends parents have a place 10 minutes from there. It was torture eating lunch at the lake house watching folks troll through there."

911254,dave524,2015-04-20 18:03:00,4508," Cast.  You'd be surprised at what you can get into.  After that north wind yesterday it's looks like double double for the first 1/2 mile out and reg for the next half mile, be a while before it clears.  Couple of years ago , Miller, on this board, caught a brown that looked like 20 + from the pier here, if you look back you should be able to find it. Best I've seen taken off the pier and I've lived almost next door 30 years."
