911885,codered,2015-04-23 13:46:00,123,"hey guys , has any one used a ice ducer in the summer from a boat? I was thinking if I could make a bracket to stabalize it? any thoughts?  "
911895,porkpie,2015-04-23 14:37:00,2521,"Sure it would work, probably best for vertical jigging while stationary.  Might be tough to stabilize at speed.  Certainly would work well enough to mark jigs etc while stopped."
911921,123chadder,2015-04-23 15:39:00,165,"for jigging only,but on wavy days it sucks unless you rig an elastic to absorb the waves"
911922,misfish,2015-04-23 15:43:00,29133,I use mine 12 months of the year.
911923,SmokestackLightnin,2015-04-23 15:44:00,390,I have an Elite 4 unit and an old portable Humminbird Wide with suction cup transducer.  I removed the Humminbird transducer from the suction cup mount.  Using a hose clamp and wood shim I clamped the ice transducer to the mount.  It seems pretty solid and will only use it in the water when anchored or trolling so it should stand up.
911956,kenzy31,2015-04-23 18:17:00,261,I've been using my X67c ice ducer on the bottom of my boats for 6-7 years. Anything over 10-15km/h and it's not ideal but will mark bottom contour and depth. Over 20km/h and you're lucky to mark depth. Hope that helps...

912027,123chadder,2015-04-24 00:28:00,165,i have used them in vertical applications and the screen bounces around in waves.....to me it cant be accurate
