Once I set the height I clamp them down to make them more stable.    Also, the up/down operation is quite lethargic and sticks from time to time. I'm sure its due to the lack of use. Can this be lubed/serviced?    TIA. "
911729,DanD,2015-04-22 20:24:00,2223,"Air ride seats use an air spring; it will hold a set height, during smooth condition; but will compress and then extend back to original height, absorbing hard bumps. It sound like you have an air lift seat(s) that you adjust to a desired height and lock in the position; like an office desk chair. Yes you can lube the shaft of the seat; but use 100% silicone lubricant; petroleum based lube, will likely damage the air seal.  Dan."
