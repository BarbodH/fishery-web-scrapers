911220,Can_38,2015-04-20 16:18:00,152,My 16' Legend ProSport lacked storage minus the main bow hatch which is mostly taken up with trolling battery.  Frame was built with pressure treated 2x2 and ply was water sealed and matching vinyl was glued using water adhesive.  Both hatches will have flush hatch locks once I get them installed.  And for those familiar with the 2006-2010 ProSports the stern has two bench seats so I have also connected these together which creates a rear casting deck for fishing partner.

911314,John Bacon,2015-04-21 00:11:00,3277,Nice work.  Do you have something to prevent the pressure treated wood from coming in contact with the aluminum?  I understand that pressure treated wood can cause corrosion in aluminum.
911315,Terry,2015-04-21 00:13:00,14456,you  did a great job on it

911326,Can_38,2015-04-21 00:46:00,152,Nice work.  Do you have something to prevent the pressure treated wood from coming in contact with the aluminum?  I understand that pressure treated wood can cause corrosion in aluminum.  I read that on previous threads so I made sure it does not touch aluminum at any point. In fact you may have noticed I used deck spindles that have a 45 at each end to fit
