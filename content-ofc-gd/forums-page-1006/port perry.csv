220814,didoban,2008-06-29 00:59:00,65,I will be at Port Perry area tomorrow for bbq and probably go fishing after.  Do you think the boat launch will be busy due to bass opening weekend? Is there a fishing tourney tomorrow?

Now, if'n I understand correctly yer main concern seems to center around yer anxiety with the number of boaters present at the boat launch, and it's inherent effect on the speed with which you can begin yer much anticipated participation in a Bass tourney? Err on the safe side by gettin' to the launch by 5:00 A.M."
