220086,Spiel,2008-06-27 00:35:00,9065,"....Lots of posts up about the annual Lakair gathering and as mentioned it was a huge success. My thanks to all who managed to tear themselves away from the mundane in order to be there.  A few firsts for me this year included finally sharing a boat with Aplumma, I enjoyed it immensley Art. Next time I hope to remember the camera as I actually caught a few decent walleye.  I also spent a fair bit of time fishing with Muskiestudd (Chris) who I had not shared a boat with since the first gathering several years back. Chris knows the lake well and it certainly showed every time we went out for walleye as seen in the following pictures in no particular order.          I think the above fish was Chris' blue walleye? The one below was my blue....                  I'll tell you all if you ever get a chance to share a boat with Chris, DO IT! Good company and a hell of a good angler.  I also a chance to share the boat on my last evening with Joey (another first) and while things didn't pan out due to a dead battery for the electric (hate anchoring but had to, windy) Joey did manage a couple of punks before losing a pretty hefty fish. We'll get 'em next champ.      I'm ready to go back though, perhaps August when I'm off?"
220113,Roy,2008-06-27 01:19:00,13728,Beauty pics Chris. I'm kinda partial to the last two. Thanks for showing them.
220114,Greencoachdog,2008-06-27 01:20:00,8163,Great report and pics Chris!!!  Could you swing by and pick me up on your way in August???
220116,Spiel,2008-06-27 01:21:00,9065,"....Keyripes, I just noticed that the fish Joey is holding (second picture) is not a walleye! Man I had only just heard this year from Kevin that there were some of those in the Nipissing system. Had the first one I've ever seen in the boat and didn't notice till now....doh!"
220131,Whopper,2008-06-27 01:29:00,2174,Good fishing report Chris!  The last one a sauger?  Thanks
220141,Sinker,2008-06-27 01:38:00,8692,Nice haul on the eyes!!  Sinker
220143,fishindevil,2008-06-27 01:44:00,6254,Nice walleyes !!!!...cheers    Mmmmm...shore lunch !!!!!!
220150,ccmtcanada,2008-06-27 01:54:00,7971," Great walleye Joey is holding, but that's a super looking boat in the background!! LOL.  Also, change the hair a little, but does anyone else think Muskiestudd looks like Gary Sinise?   Spiel....it was great chatting with you again this year....and thanks for letting us follow you out to that walleye spot.  You looking into getting a seat belt for that boat any time soon??  Cliff"
220216,Mike the Pike,2008-06-27 04:15:00,3421,Thanks fot the fish pics Spiel at least some PPL caught some walleye unlike the hog fella from way down..........
220266,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-27 12:20:00,0,I knew there was someone out there catching fish at Lakair.lol Looks like it has some pretty good pickerel fishing. Thanks for sharing.
220271,Spiel,2008-06-27 12:30:00,9065," ....BINGO, you got it Phil. It is indeed a sauger.    ....LOL, perhaps I should if I can't stay focused on what I'm doing."
220275,tjsa,2008-06-27 12:38:00,1578," pickerel fishing???????????..............looks like WALLEYE  fishing to me  thanks for the pictures Chris.................and Chris. How old is Muskiestudds ballcap, looks kinda well worn?? It's probably just getting broken in though.  And yes, that fish is a Sauger, spots on the tail and dorsal fin are a dead giveaway.  Hope you get the opportunity to get back up there in August, and we expect a report, with pictures."
220286,Whopper,2008-06-27 12:57:00,2174,"That's what I thought Chris (sauger), Tom you are correct that's how I knew I caught one up there last August.  We have saugeye down here which is a cross between a male sauger/female walleye and they are a little harder to tell the difference, they have the same markings on the dorsal fin but they still have the ""white"" spot on the bottom of the tail fins."
220367,corvette1,2008-06-27 16:05:00,1765,good job on the eyes
220578,ChrisK,2008-06-28 11:22:00,2772,"Chris, It was a long time coming.  Lots of fun and good fishin..... Between Spiels jigging tactics and my lindy worm harnesess we seemed to put the walleye right were we liked them,on the end of the hook !!! Can hardly wait until next year  Cheers !!"
221189,Joey,2008-06-30 01:37:00,9122,"Hey, my first sauger and I didn't even know it.  Thanks again for taking me out Chris.  It was nice to sit and chat, even tho the bite never turned on for us.  Hope I didn't get you hooked again  We will definately get them next year, I'm looking forward to it.  Great pics too hon.  Joey"
221212,TJQ,2008-06-30 02:25:00,7806,Nice PICKEREL dude...
