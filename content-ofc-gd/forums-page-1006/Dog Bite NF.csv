220757,johnl,2008-06-28 21:22:00,197,I got a rottweiler and if it ever bit one of my nieces or nephews or any kid it would be done.If someone elses dog bit them they would be dead too.I dont mind it when he bites my drunk buddy's for messing with him though
220776,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-28 22:46:00,314,"I have owned 2 rotties.......... Awesome dogs............  Last one had a stroke............ and lost 90% of vision and balance.  which in return made her a little aggresive towards my kids.  Vet said it was because it got startled easy.  We had her put down  First rottie lived 14 years............    died of a stroke aswell.  This neighbour crap is still ruining my weekend...........  just burns me up that feel i shouldnt of kicked the dog.  Wife told me they said it is a good learning experience for the kids..............???????????  Now my 2 year old is walking around house saying ""Dog Bite Me"" errrrrrrrrr   Also probally now going to have to tie up my mastiff to................   he does go over on there yard......"
220830,wallyboss,2008-06-29 01:51:00,1095,Nothing tells a dog to stay in his own yard like a Louisville Slugger!!!  Get the humane society and the cops involved.
220831,nofish4me,2008-06-29 01:52:00,404,"Last  I time posted on a dog topic, I was touched up by a Mod.. Won't say anymore than, Dog is lucky to be alive. They aren't around here, if they do that."

220847,Roy,2008-06-29 02:15:00,13728,I love happy endings.
220669,pigeonfisher,2008-06-28 15:39:00,696,  Personally I wouldn't put this statement on the internet.  Whatever happens now is premeditated and that changes the game completely.
220673,maybe,2008-06-28 15:57:00,307,"I'm not saying you shouldn't be concerned about your kid getting hurt, but look back at your other posts - you always seem to have it in for something or someone.  No offence, but you're easily the most combative person on this site.  Makes a person wonder how aggressive and in-your-face your kids must be.  I'm really concerned about your admission of at least 5 bites by multiple animals in a relatively short timespan.  Dogs don't just go off for no reason, and they certainly don't bite without trying their best to warn you first.  They have a surprisingly reasonable and structured set of behaviours.  Something's drastically wrong if you're crossing the line and missing the message this often.  Stanley Coren wrote an excellent book that will help you, if you can look at this objectively.  It's called ""How To Speak Dog: Mastering the Art of Dog-Human Communication,"" and there's a copy in stock at the Coles in Quinte Mall.  It'll be the best $16 you've spent this year.  Teaching the kid ""if it hurts you, we'll just kill it"" isn't going to help them - unless you want to see them behind bars.  You've got a great opportunity to give them some really useful life skills here.  Don't blow it.  Good luck."
220679,Guest lundboy,2008-06-28 16:44:00,0," I would tend to agree with the above.  While any animal can become nasty if it feels threatened, many animals would rather shy away from an encounter.  That particular breed KEESHON has the following temperament:   Temperament a one year old male Keeshond   Keeshonden tend to be very playful, with quick reflexes and strong jumping ability. They are quick learners and eager to please. Because Keeshonden are quick learners, they also learn the things you didn't necessarily wish to teach them - very quickly. However, Keeshonden make excellent agility and obedience dogs. So amenable to proper training is this bright, sturdy dog that Keeshonden have been successfully trained to serve as guide dogs for the blind; only their lack of size has prevented them from being more widely used in this role.  They love children and are excellent family dogs, preferring to be close to their humans whenever possible. They generally get along with other dogs as well and will enjoy a good chase around the yard. Keeshonden are very intuitive and empathic and are often used as comfort dogs. Most notably, at least one Keeshond, Tikva, was at Ground Zero on 9/11 to help comfort the rescue workers.[1] The breed has a tendency to become especially clingy towards their owners, even in comparison to other dogs. If their owner is out, or in another room behind a closed door, they may sit, waiting for their owner to reappear, even if there are other people nearby. Many have been referred to as their ""owner's shadow,"" or ""velcro dogs"".   Did anyone ever hear of a hose?  I suspect that the dog may sense something in you or your kids that it doesn't like.  Have you kicked it before perhaps?  Done something to it it remembers?  The neighbours may have a for sale sign up for a reason."
220693,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-28 17:36:00,314,The dog is very old........... I have never done anything to either of there dogs...........   actually use to buy them bones and let them crap on my yard.  i have lived beside these people for 7 years..........    and yes each bite did have a reason.  first bite the dog got spooked by sons powerwheels......   (on my yard) Second and third bites were caused from pulling it off my dog........(on my yard)  For some strange reason.........  this dog started attacking my dog outa the blue after my dog had a stroke and could no longer see.  Bottom line is ............    There dog is old and miserable........  and shouldnt be roaming my yard anymore since it does bite!  To say i always have problems with people is just funny......... Yapping on the internet VS being a real life friend is totally different..... Im very well respected in the neighbour hood and all other neighbours went over and told them to lock the dog up aswell......
220694,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-28 17:37:00,314, House is forsale cause there getting divorced..........
220722,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-28 19:25:00,2585,huge dog lover here!  but if any dog attacked my 2 year old it would be dead.  i dont think you did anything wrong at all.
