220822,purekgw,2008-06-29 01:30:00,585,Can any one help me find a really good large mouth bass fishing spot around hamilton we where going to go to toronto islands but you need a permit to do so. So any where around hamilton probaly an hour we aren't keeping fish so dosn't  matter if you can eat or not and we got boat and like fishing shallow water any one got any spots
220824,modny,2008-06-29 01:39:00,502,"mountsberg.  its great there, especially if u have a canoe or tin boat. no gas motors though.  work the weeds and flats and stumps. with some natural color jigs. get there early, bass like the early morn and dusk. especially if u wanna do top water..  personally i'd probably toss some small perch minnow raps, some spooks, x raps or husky jerk, black spinner baits work well  and some jigs on heavy braid to work the stumps and heavy cover."
220826,BabyHerc,2008-06-29 01:42:00,285,Grand River for smallies and Guelph Lake for largies.
220828,purekgw,2008-06-29 01:46:00,585,well we have a crestliner with a 90 but we do have a trolling motor i dont know if we would be let in or not
220832,modny,2008-06-29 01:52:00,502,"no dice   i say grand river then... too bad u didn;t have a smaller boat\\   the section from paris to brantford of the grand is great. as far as i know, its no live bait, and barbless hooks only.  and catch and release only.  yea good smallmouth fishing can be found on the diesturned area where the nith river meets the grand in paris. and 3 miles furthie south at the mouth of whitmans creek. sometimes u can find browns and rainbows there tooooo  smallies respond well to grubs, tubes crank and top water baits fished in deeper holes around sunken structure."
220835,purekgw,2008-06-29 01:57:00,585,i fish whitemans quite a bit but we want to take the boat out and my dads freind is taking his to so  is Burlington Bay any good for large mouth??
220839,modny,2008-06-29 02:01:00,502,i think working the westerly shorline in the flats produces a good mix
220841,purekgw,2008-06-29 02:06:00,585,i always thought that we go by there all the time but never try that might be last resort i guess might go long point bay but is it weedy there and good for large mouth?
220865,modny,2008-06-29 02:32:00,502,ya LPB will produce  i dont know that water very well tho
220871,pikehunter,2008-06-29 02:36:00,1659,They will or should let you in with your boat. I know Valens will. Keep the motor up out of the water and if you have a separate/removable gas tank leave it at home. Use the electric and you will be fine.
220874,modny,2008-06-29 02:39:00,502,the only problem may be launching though  u will have to back her in REAAAL far
220899,Mattones,2008-06-29 03:47:00,587,Anyone head to Valens today?  i may be heading out there tomorrow for a day of fishing. rent a row boat and fish.
