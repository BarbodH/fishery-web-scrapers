220492,Gerritt,2008-06-27 23:58:00,6129,Sign up to photobucket... it is simple and easy to use... after you have uploaded your pics to photobucket copy and paste your image code here... presto bango..  www.photobucket.com  G
220498,Greencoachdog,2008-06-28 00:21:00,8163,What Gerritt said.  Photobucket even resizes for you when you upload.  It's the hosting site that all the coolest kids are using!!!
220545,jediangler,2008-06-28 03:50:00,1923,I use shrinkpictures.com to resize and myfishingpictures.com for image hosting. Both pretty simple to use.
