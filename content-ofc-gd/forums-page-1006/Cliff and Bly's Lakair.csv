218841,Moosebunk,2008-06-24 02:48:00,3970,I've checked this one and all others Cliff.  Keeping an eye.  Some great photos and memories for all involved. Kudos to OFC'ers for another annual success.

218906,Victor,2008-06-24 11:35:00,1609,Great report Cliff and Carole! You guys take amazing pictures! Looks like everyone had a wonderful time especially with Cliff's smile in the last pic with the walleye. Next year I gotta try to make it.
218923,Guest Johnny Bass,2008-06-24 12:29:00,0,Sounds like the fish and weather co-operated and a great time was had by all. Thanks for sharing.
218929,steve_paul,2008-06-24 12:54:00,658,"Great report Cliff, thanks for sharing  May have to alter our dates we go to the French River next year so I can make it up to the GTG."
218941,fishnsled,2008-06-24 13:31:00,3520,Great report Cliff!  I've got to get to next years G2G and it's looking like that might work out.
219120,Greencoachdog,2008-06-24 20:53:00,8163,It was great to see the Dynamic Dua again!!!  Excellent pics!!!
219151,bigbuck,2008-06-24 22:32:00,2449,I guess you caught yourselves a whole whack of fish!!! Awesome!!!
219161,ehg,2008-06-24 23:08:00,2666,"Looks like you had a good time and caught some decent fish! The picture of you coming into camp, on your boat, as the sunset (in Kickingfrog's thread) captures a great moment up there.  Cheers, ehg"
219225,Mike the Pike,2008-06-25 01:09:00,3421,Excellent report and Photos Cliff thanks for taking the time to throw that together  Now I have to know what happened to Carole's wrist????
219247,Marty,2008-06-25 01:35:00,873,Was great to meet you both.  I'll get those recipes to you . . . and anyone else who wants them.
219286,Greencoachdog,2008-06-25 02:44:00,8163,  I think she sprained it pulling in some of Cliff's OFC tourney entries!!!
219389,ccmtcanada,2008-06-25 12:41:00,7971, Likewise Marty!  Can't wait for the recipe too...I liked it better than the fish...LOL.   C'mon Glen...what happens at Lakair stays at Lakair....
219452,corvette1,2008-06-25 16:09:00,1765,looks like a great time great report maybe next year
219537,Bly,2008-06-25 18:15:00,1556, Too much work and not enough fun       For the record.....Cliff caught all of his own fish and although we may have been equal in numbers (didn't count) he definitely had better quality fish!
219613,pigeonfisher,2008-06-25 20:40:00,696,  I think that happened to me once...Or more than once.
220063,wgk36,2008-06-26 23:32:00,69,Great report Cliff.  Feels like I was there. Maybe I can talk MTP into going next year.  I'll need someone to split the gas on such a long trek.
220088,Rich Clemens,2008-06-27 00:38:00,3131,Great report folks ... good to see the both of you again.  Patsy was able to pick up her very first Walleye that week.
221207,Joey,2008-06-30 02:16:00,9122,"Super report Cliff.  I'm just trying to find all the Lakair reports I missed this week.  Your camera takes great pics.  You captured some ""interesting"" moments  Joey"
221350,Smokey,2008-06-30 13:45:00,1278,"Great pics Cliff. One thing I notice in all your pics is everyone is smiling, even Lew. A great sign that a good time was had by all.  Thanks for posting them and congrats on all you fish.  Mike"
218748,Gerritt,2008-06-24 01:07:00,6129,"Awesome report guys! Glad you got into a few!.. you guys are lucky everything was to the east of you... (Which happens to be where I was, it was nasty LOL)  Surprised I am the only to pick up on this though...  Why is Carol wearing Glens hat???... Seems everyone is wearing Glens Hat!!!!!  dirt.. we need the dirt!  G"
218754,Dondorfish,2008-06-24 01:12:00,1000,  I believe that that is Waynes hat she is wearing - no?   Don
218755,Gerritt,2008-06-24 01:13:00,6129,  I was thinking it might be Bills?

218791,ccmtcanada,2008-06-24 01:42:00,7971,"Oh....those hats...  Truth is, the Plumma boys paid people 20 bucks to wear them."
218804,ccmtcanada,2008-06-24 01:59:00,7971, I knew he was up to no good!!!
