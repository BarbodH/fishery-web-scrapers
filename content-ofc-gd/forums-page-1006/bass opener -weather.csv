220565,Canuck2fan,2008-06-28 09:44:00,1444,Yep stay safe everyone a few fish aren't worth getting zapped. The radar looks good where I am going though just about the time I get there it should be clear of the lightning..... I sure hope so anyhow LOL
220647,jediangler,2008-06-28 15:03:00,1923,My fishing partners aren't going to be able to go till Sunday. I'm sure the bass will still be there. Good luck to all this weekend.
220681,lunkerbasshunter,2008-06-28 16:55:00,2585,"was on nipissing at 5am, rained light until about 9 then it poored, heard thunder adn headed in.  will post report later today, great fishing!  cheers!"
220695,forrest,2008-06-28 17:42:00,1032,  If this is true then why are so many people falling over themselves to get out for bass? those fish are leaving town at midnight....thats the rumor.  forrest
220702,SlowPoke,2008-06-28 18:03:00,2984, Some didn't wait until midnight. I just passed a bunch of bass heading west on the 401 near London.....     They were in a SCHOOL bus
220716,Canuck2fan,2008-06-28 18:58:00,1444,"I had fun, fished from 8:30 till 11:30 it was raining most of the time. Jesus had stopped taking pictures just before I got there thankfully. Landed 10 smallies, 2 largies, 6 WGSF and one HUGE sunfish..... pretty good considering I COULD NOT get anyway near where the good fishing usually is this early. The banks were just too slippery to get a toe hold on and I wasn't interested in swimming. OH well it is open and had a good if not great start.  4 smallies on the first 6 casts made the rain all but disappear LOL."
220742,BillM,2008-06-28 20:45:00,17367,"Rain, rain rain pretty much all day out on Little/Gloucester.  Let up around 11am and we were pretty much done by then.  I think there was either a bass tourney or there will be one and people were pre-fishing but man, 20+ bass boats ripping around on the lake.  From about 6-11am we boated about 10 or so fish.  My biggest was a 3lb largey, right in front of all the tournament guys driving through the channel  Also had a miss on a perch coloured Suick on our way back, just messing around at the side of the boat.  It was either a small ski or a decent sized pike.  All in all a great day, a little wet but the fish didn't mind."
220746,Mattones,2008-06-28 20:53:00,587,I was going to drive somewhere and fish but today my car went belly up and i wont be getting it back till Monday if it can be fixed. if not I need a car asap for my G test in mid July.
220753,tbayboy,2008-06-28 21:12:00,1497,Left the house at 6 in a torrential downpour with lightning and thunder - got to Kitchener and it didn't rain a drop.  Too bad the Grand had turned into a chocolote milk highway.  Ah well.  The weekend isn't over yet.
220761,motv8tr,2008-06-28 21:44:00,2587,"Ahh well that's how it goes, at least I now know you're still alive Dave   Hope you and the others manage to get out sometime this weekend while I'm slaving away at work for the next 4 days  Maureen"
220915,EC1,2008-06-29 07:24:00,930,was lucky that i got out at during the night and fished as soon as it opened. Stayed out til it started to rain
