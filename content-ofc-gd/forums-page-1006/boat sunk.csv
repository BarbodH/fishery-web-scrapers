Went out this afternoon and stood in my chest waders trying to lift the transom whilst bilge pump was on, but water was crashing over faster than the little pump i installed from CT could empty it.  I gave up after 1 hour, waves had come over the top of my waders too so totaly soaked through, so glad there was a howling wind cuz i was cursing at the top of my lungs and dont think my neighbours could here me over the wind. I'm normally pretty good watching weather report and getting it out before it hits(i dont have a dock to moor it to) but was totally sidetracked these last 2 days with news of wife's pregnancy and work.....lol...i think i was more stressed about the boat than anything else!!! Luckily the motor was not underwater....but its stressful....boy is it stressful...specially since once its under not much ya can do about it."

220908,jace,2008-06-29 05:18:00,472,"Ah,...didn't see the details and didn't know it was going on now.  I hope it starts for you, it'll save you a whack of money for the rebuild.   You'd be surprised to see how fast the high carbon metals start rust like the rings and sleeves.    I guess nobody here had a dirt bike or 3-4 wheeler when they were young?  I can't count the number of times i went through a stream that was a little deeper than i thought."
