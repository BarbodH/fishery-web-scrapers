220380,tdotfisherman,2008-06-27 17:08:00,317,"The great thing about fishing is that sometimes you catch a species of fish that you weren't expecting at all, and it just adds to the thrill of it all. I've caught perch on crankbaits that were bigger then they are. I've caught northern pike on salmon lures in lake ontario, and I've caught catfish while out bass fishing.. gotta love the unexpected.."
220390,Seaweed,2008-06-27 17:34:00,135,"Twice now in my fishing career I have caught very large walleye on 10"" believers.  Both times at night ironically one under a full moon for sure and the other one I don't remember what the moon was.  Both times the fish fought so hard I thought for sure I was into muskie."

220427,DANIMAL,2008-06-27 19:10:00,215,Cought about a 1 lb. largemouth figure eighting a 10'' jerkbait one time. It followed it in and even swam a full eight before hitting it.

OH YA i caught a seagull the other day with a matzou."
220898,JohnF,2008-06-29 03:34:00,3494," Not quite as extreme, but I still wish I'd thought to take a pic yesterday. I caught a little Rock Bass on the tail hook of a Rapala body bait longer than he was. Ya gotta like that kind of attitude, like the proverbial flea and the elephant.  On reflection I probably should have just tried jigging with him still on there.  JF"
220169,Cudz,2008-06-27 02:15:00,2652,"1. I was out fishing with a friend today and we were drop shotting tiny tubes and micro senkos for perch.  All of a sudden my friend hooks into a big (relative to the perch we were catching) pike.  He hooked it perfectly in the side of the mouth.  Hard to catch pike on a drop shot setup when the hook is attached directly to the 8 pound line.  He was using a tiny pearl 2"" (yes 2"") senko.  The pike was about 9 pounds and we even managed to land it.  I have a pic as well but it is on my friend's phone.   2. The other day I caught a 10"" crappie on pearl 10cm x-rap.  (not so unbelievable)  3.  I have a tackle box full of $10-$30 lures and I threw out a popper that I bought at dolarama for a buck.  After only 2 casts I caught a 16.5"" 2 pounde smalie.  Too funny."

220173,purekgw,2008-06-27 02:22:00,585,i was using a huge musky lure just for laughs and caught a 1lb small  mouth the back treble hook was in its mouth the lure could have eaten the bass.....

220178,ccmtcanada,2008-06-27 02:27:00,7971,I was jigging for walleye with a white/pink twister tail and a 10 pound pike slammed it.  Amazing I brought it in considering the 6 pound mono without a leader.
220190,Cudz,2008-06-27 02:42:00,2652,One more for you.  About 20 years ago we were downrigging for lakers on simcoe and I was reading fish at about 25 ft over 90ft of water.  Because the LCR 2000 was such a basic finder I assumed the suspended fish were just clutter or false readings.  I threw out a deeper diving big rapala fat rap and caught a 7 pound whitefish.

220197,Hillrat,2008-06-27 02:55:00,10,"Had a honkin big Perch latch onto a rattlin rap once while fishing for pike, but I guess that wasn't too strange. By far the weirdest is not once but twice nhow I have seen my roomie hook into a big Muskie while we were fishing for Bass. First time was on a 6"" Senko. Got it in the corner of the mouth  then ran under a log or something under water. He fought the thing for a good long while, the whole time rubbing his line back and forth across said log. Just when he was about to give up the fish came ouy and after a few mins he landed it. Think it measured out to 41"". The Second was while casting tubes for smallies in a river. Again, corner of the mouth, and the fish was landed. Lucky sot..."

In fact my good fishing Bud caught a mid 40's Pike last weekend under the same circumstances. It happens too often up here. The fewer Pike that I catch, the better."

This winter, a student of mine, caught a 50"" musky on tiny rapala ice fishing jig.  Corner of mouth caught and landed."
