220968,Andy,2008-06-29 14:33:00,330,Lighter fluid??
220978,Gerritt,2008-06-29 14:54:00,6129,"Sinker, I will give it a shot today.. heading out CT anyways and will pick some up. Thanks for the suggestion! I will also grab a degreaser like Glen mentions as well,  What I dont get is the stuff Paul suggested is made to remove tar and it did not touch it!.. Mind you it work well for the exhaust marks @ the stern  G"
218107,Gerritt,2008-06-22 21:05:00,6129,"I have some rub marks on the outside of my aluminum hull, not scratches but just rubbing... some of them are red from a friends dock.. is their anyway to remove them? and should I apply wax to the hull to prevent further marks? I do use bumpers but it seems a bit of rubbing is inevitable?..  #2  I also left my spare tire in the boat while it was in storage.. I now have a brown ring (Tar?) on my vinyl flooring I have tried dish soap and a scrub brush but to no avail.. anyone know a way to remove this unsightly ring without doing damage to my new vinyl floor?  Thanks in advance!  G."
218131,Gerritt,2008-06-22 21:57:00,6129,"Thanks Paul, I have not heard of it before... do you know if it is safe to use on vinyl?"
218157,Mike the Pike,2008-06-22 22:28:00,3421,Gerritt go to the grocerie store and buy some VIM I used it to take black grime of the vinyl on my tent trailer today.Good stuff
218167,forrest,2008-06-22 22:44:00,1032,"save some cash and a trip to the store, try white vinegar."
218188,addict,2008-06-22 23:50:00,475,i have cheap vinyl tiles in my apt.spilled oven cleaner on the floor and it turned brown tried everything to get the poo coloured stain out then i tried an sos pad and presto.as for the hull not sure what to use.when my paint job was fresh on my boat i used to wax it this kept the lake scum from forming and made it easier to clean.now all i do is ocasinally vaccum the inside and go fishing the lake water washes it for me.
218229,Cast-Away,2008-06-23 01:35:00,790,"Gerritt, rubbing compound will remove the scuff on the paint quite nicely."
218230,HTHM,2008-06-23 01:40:00,4082,"Try fantastic for the tire ring, and rubbing compound for the scuff marks."
218246,keep it reel,2008-06-23 02:05:00,8,magic eraser for the tire ring
218321,Chris,2008-06-23 10:49:00,405,Best thing for tough stains is isopropal alcohol. Get it at your drug store it's pretty cheap.
218333,Sinker,2008-06-23 11:39:00,8692,Spray nine works great too.....  Sinker
218338,Gerritt,2008-06-23 12:00:00,6129,Thanks for all the advice guys. I will take some before and after pics.  G
220728,Gerritt,2008-06-28 19:46:00,6129,"Thanks for all the advice guys!.. the rubbing compound worked great on the scuff marks!! I followed up with wax.... now to finish the rest of the boat LOL.. here are a few before and after pictures...  Before pictures...     And after...       As for the Tire Mark... I tried vinegar, Alcohol, Vim and even the stuff Paul suggested.... NOTHING is touching it!... before I rip the vinyl out in frustration is there any other suggestions?  Here is a picture of what I am dealing with..    Thanks again for any and all advice!  G"
220733,Spiel,2008-06-28 19:57:00,9065,....Just buy a new boat.
220738,Greencoachdog,2008-06-28 20:14:00,8163,"Just a guess, but try something like Armorall spray foam tire cleaner on the brown ring... a little on a rag and do a spot aboot the size of a dime to see if it works, or maybe some WD-40 will work!  Let us know!"
220744,maybe,2008-06-28 20:50:00,307,Did you try the magic eraser on the rust?  I've used them to get red dye stains from spilled nail polish off of countertops.  Amazing what they'll take off without chemicals.
220796,forrest,2008-06-29 00:08:00,1032,"Take a crayon and write: ""this circle was caused by a rusty spare tire.  Please do not ask me any questions about it on penalty of being thrown overboard""  that should take care of it fine.  OR  as previously stated, buy a new boat."
220800,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-29 00:17:00,314, These magic eraser's are very impressive... Made by mr clean........... i was walking around house with it after seeing it work............  rubbing every stain i found......lol  another thing ive done on stains is use the powder laundry detergent.......   seems to work well..........just kinda hard on hands  CLR is another that works like a champ............
220802,JohnF,2008-06-29 00:21:00,3494,Paint a smiley face on it? Give yer boat a bit of personality.  JF
220807,BENNY,2008-06-29 00:41:00,37,"I have to add Mr Clean Magic Eraser as well, I have not seen anything work better, still amazes me what it will take off. Alum,leather,vinyl etc."
220914,Gerritt,2008-06-29 06:42:00,6129,"I should have added I tried the Mr.Clean scrubber... my wife swears by them... That said this is not a rust stain.. This is from the tire itself and not the rim.. Be it tar, grease or some other chemical compound..  I am stumped here.. on what will remove this sticky brown junk from my vinyl... and have spend 30.00 on different treatment thus far to rid myself of it to no avail....   I have learned a lesson though...  Never leave you spare tire in the boat out in the sun!  G  Chris.. you may have a point!"
220916,forrest,2008-06-29 07:58:00,1032,"If it is a tire a rubber stain you need a degreasing agent:   -soapy water (I am sure you tried) -Goo gone, they sell it at CTC.  I am sure the automotive guys have seen this b4 too.  forrest"
220920,wallyboss,2008-06-29 09:46:00,1095,"Try this from Canadian Tire, Somebody already mentioned  Goo Gone,  if nothing else works  this will!!!  http://www.cleantrains.com/id44.htm"
220939,Greencoachdog,2008-06-29 11:41:00,8163,"Try the tire foam Gerritt, if it's tar you'll need a petroleum based cleaner."
220953,maybe,2008-06-29 13:08:00,307,"Oh, sorry G - I totally blanked when you said it was sticky the first time.  Duh.  2 years ago, we did the dance of 1,000 products with some dried sticker residue on our fibreglass.  Unbelievable stuff, nothing was even making a dent in it.  I finally got a cheap little can of Goof Off from Home Depot, and it was like a hot knife through butter.  Amazing stuff.  It's my go to for lost causes now."
220966,Sinker,2008-06-29 14:27:00,8692,Did you try the spray nine? That stuff works good bud!  Sinker
