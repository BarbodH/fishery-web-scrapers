If you can forgo the crown land part you should find tons of lodges etc that allow camping w/ boat rentals.. or perhaps a provincial park?  G"
221368,duber,2008-06-30 14:28:00,220,Crotch Lake is the only place that comes to mind. There is a lodge there and crown land campsites.I don't know if they rent boats or not but you could check it out.
221407,Cookslav,2008-06-30 15:55:00,1457,"I gotcha covered  Moon river basin Marina rents boats, you can park there, and there are some beautifull crown land camp sites up there. Give them a call and I'm about 110% sure they can point a few sites out from their docks.  http://www.moonbasinmarina.com/main.htm"
221409,goodtimer,2008-06-30 15:58:00,53,"good call on moon river basin.  really nice owner, renting boats shouldn't be a problem.  had a great time there last year, fun place."
221414,Gerritt,2008-06-30 16:06:00,6129,woot! good job fellas! have fun on you're trip!  G
221420,Cookslav,2008-06-30 16:15:00,1457,"Was there 2 weeks ago, and enjoyed...fishing was HORRIBLE, but thats not the norm. I guess thats why they call it fishing and not catching right?  Anyway if you head there enjoy it, Its a beautifull part of the province, and is one of a few places that offer a very real possibility of breaking world records! Go big or go home!  Cheers,"
