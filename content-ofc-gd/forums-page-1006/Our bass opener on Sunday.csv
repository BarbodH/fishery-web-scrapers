We arrived at 5:45am just in time to see the OPP escort some campers out of the campground. We were in the water fishing by 6am. The Shipper brought along his dog, Manna, to fish with and it stood guard protecting our boats.  She turned out to be a pretty good boat dog and spent most of her time watching the Shipper's jig & grub as he reeled it in to the boat.  I had Rufus in my boat and he was the man today landing 5 bass (3 largemouth & 2 smallmouth) as well as 2 pike. Here he returns a 16"" largemouth to the lake with the Shipper and Manna in the background.  The Shipper caught 1 pike and 1 smallmouth,both small. I caught 1 pike and several small perch before I hooked this 11"" perch and then this 14"" smallmouth shortly after.  The bass went back but the perch came home for supper. Rufus managed big fish of the day as well as the first and the most. This largie was 18.5"" and hit a wooly beavertail thrown to wood cover.  Water temps were 74F and the wind was SW15km/h. We had about 30 minutes of rain but that was it as most of the time it was sun & clouds. Saw lots of boats fishing and many kids swimming and having a great Canada day weekend. We called it a day at 12noon.  Back on top of the cars for the short and sweet 45km drive home. Good fun on the water with buddies and a bulldog."
