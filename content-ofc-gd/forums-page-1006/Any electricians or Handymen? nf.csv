220711,Tinman,2008-06-28 18:45:00,376,"Hey guys, i work installing furnaces and duct work in construction sites, when the electricians leave they generally leave all their scraps around. Is there an easy way to get the black and white jacket off the wires, besides burning it?  Thanks Denis"
220712,Whopper,2008-06-28 18:46:00,2174,Razor knife and a pair of gloves
220713,Tinman,2008-06-28 18:48:00,376,"thats what i've been doing, just though maybe there was a tool out there."
220715,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-28 18:57:00,314,I seen a machine on tv once that was made just for that.  Not sure if it was something they bought or made....  was slick though.
220725,Whopper,2008-06-28 19:34:00,2174, They do make a tool for the bigger stuff but I suspect your stripping smaller wire like #12 or #10 If your doing smaller solid wire you can take a regular wire stripper and pull the insulation off in one foot sections.
220740,Greencoachdog,2008-06-28 20:35:00,8163,Quickest and easiest way is to burn it. It won't be worth the labor you put into it to strip it by hand... unless you have nothing else to do.
220745,cpguy29,2008-06-28 20:52:00,148,why would you want to? most scrap dealers will take it with the insulation on.
220755,Tinman,2008-06-28 21:13:00,376,apparently they will give you about a 1.50 less a pund if you bring it back burnt or with the covers on
220779,MoriaRiverMan,2008-06-28 22:55:00,314,Id make my own machine......  Two wheels with a spring loaded knife in center would do the trick........  
220788,Slyatv,2008-06-28 23:52:00,45,A Pair of gloves ... important    a sharp Knife locked in a vise ...Useful .... 1.50 more a pound ...Worth it !  The Price of Copper is HIGH right now ! .. Using the Vise allows for a Smoother 'rip' thru the insulation and can include you first pass on one side of the wire .. Burning it really ain't good for the enviroment . ? ! Good Luck to ya !

220833,droopdude,2008-06-29 01:53:00,10,Burning off the insulation is illegal and the scrap dealer may refuse to take it afterward.
