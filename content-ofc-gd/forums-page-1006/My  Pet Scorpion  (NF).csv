I have had her for 2 months & use a set of bent tongs to lift her by the tail. Anyway, I put her on my bed to give her room to walk. I just sat with her for about an hour getting braver as we got to know each other better! Lol..  At one point she crawled up onto a pillow & I used the tongs across & in front of her to stop her. She gently grabbed the metal tongs with each pincer then swung her tail over. I thought she was going to attack the tongs but instead.. she started sharpening her stinger the way you would use a steel rod to sharpen a knife!!!! I was blown away by this creatures subtle intelligence.. All of Creation is truly amazing-astounding - wonderful in it's own way. God bless the creatures & us all. Peace..Dan  "

220931,modny,2008-06-29 11:17:00,502,that would be a bad ass tattoo
220952,pameladallaire,2008-06-29 12:50:00,470,That's a cute pet.   Will you be picking it up by the tail soon with your fingers?  They only strike what is in their grasp.  Pam
220959,danbo,2008-06-29 13:51:00,2646,"Lol! I've done that a few times but the tongs are safer! It just seems to have a nasty disposition about ""handling"" & cannot ever be trusted."
220970,Tinman,2008-06-29 14:36:00,376,not my idea of a cuddly pet! lol but to each his own! I would never have the guts to get one of them
220983,shane,2008-06-29 15:19:00,652,What if you got up one morning and it's tank was empty?  I'd have to sell the house.
220999,Tinman,2008-06-29 16:03:00,376,hopefully a large can of raid would work! lol
221000,danbo,2008-06-29 16:07:00,2646,"Believe it or not..the sting is supposedly a #1 on a scale of 1-10 pain threshold. More or less like a bee sting! They also are very conservative with injecting venom & will usually ""dry-sting"" you with a fair-warning."
221001,Tinman,2008-06-29 16:08:00,376,that makes me feel a whole lot better!
221004,danbo,2008-06-29 16:17:00,2646,
221005,Tinman,2008-06-29 16:21:00,376,"i had a roomate when i lived in lindsey and he had one of them huge cockroaches, i ever told him that it got out, then squish!!"
221019,danbo,2008-06-29 17:28:00,2646,"I don't blame ya, bro! At least a scorp has some intrigue.."
