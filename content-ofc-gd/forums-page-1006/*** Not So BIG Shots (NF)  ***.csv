220470,Clampet,2008-06-27 22:32:00,1947,I think it is amazing how a few cents a liter raise on the price of fuel can make these so called affluent people crumble to the point of selling their high end cottages.  Not so Big Shots
220473,John,2008-06-27 22:57:00,2956,I think that you may be reading between the wrong lines there Clamp-It. Most of the affluent higher end cottagers could care less about 50 cents more a litre. It's the cottagers who's place has been in the family for many years or even generations and huge increase in taxes along with the additional fuel costs have pushed them to the limit and beyond. They are the one's who's property will come on the market first. it is very quickly becoming a buyers market.

220577,Guest lundboy,2008-06-28 11:14:00,0,"Yep the time's here that will separate the ""wanabes"" from the real rich.  Now you'll start to see who the people are that can really afford those cottages and luxury SUVs.  One telling trend is the sudden urge for people to pack up their suburban homes, and move back to the compact cities: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/...the-cities.html  The class system is kicking up a notch (or down a notch depending on your point of view)."
220585,Greencoachdog,2008-06-28 12:01:00,8163," Gloom, despair, and agony on me.  Deep dark depression, excessive misery!"
