Well as you can see they worked, snaped a few pictures of the fish coming towards me.The bass was 2.8lbsThis one was 2.7lbsAs said in the winter months i know these will work and they do. I will have many more fish on this bait later this season.(Snake Only Fish)Black Snake (4.8lbs)Black SnakeAnother little bassMy first ever PikeBrown Snake (22"" long)Brown Snake (2.11lbs)Brown Snake (2.5lbs)Brown Snake (2.0lbs)Brown Snake (1.15lbs)That was all for this year on my new lures and as i said earlier in the year, this bait would produce fish and indeed it did. If will hopefully send in another order during the winter months and get ready for another exciting summer of topwater snake fishing!"
