387395,muskymike,2009-09-27 01:24:00,772,"Hi guys,  I have an odd request, does anyone know where I could purchase anywhere from 100-150 either Spinner baits or Spoons with either an Engraving or painted short script on them each?  I dont need them until August of 2010 but would like to order them soon. I dont need packaging, just the lures are they are gifts.  If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,  Mike"
