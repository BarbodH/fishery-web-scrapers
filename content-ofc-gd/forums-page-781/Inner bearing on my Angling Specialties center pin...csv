I'd like to soak them and get them ready for this year...  Mikey?  I'd hate to have to run down to Toronto in order for Tom to do it himself..."

388094,Radnine,2009-09-29 10:45:00,1538, I have seen other centre pinners that lube the bearings by soaking them in the creek that they are fishing in while they take a picture. Jim

388605,Scott S,2009-09-30 17:14:00,203,I was the same as you Bill. I ended up going to Angling Specialties on Hwy7. The guy there had it out in seconds. I had tried everything. Ended up replacing the bearings for about $90. Hope this helps. Scooter
