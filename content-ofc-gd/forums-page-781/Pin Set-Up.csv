388950,krawler,2009-10-01 14:39:00,167,"Im always getting tangles when put new line on my pin, i think im putting too much on my reel, how do i know how much to put on?  Also, ive always ran Siglon F 8lb wth fluoro leader.  Talked to some guys who recommend siglon, followed by 20lb braid (50 yrds), then 10lb mono for your float (2yrds) and fluoro as your leader.  blood knot to connect siglon and braid and swivels for remaining set up.  What would the advantage of such a set up be?  ANyone run something similar or different?  Im questioning my current set up due to tangles and well, i havnt caught a fish this season, lol.  thanks"
388953,BillM,2009-10-01 14:43:00,17367,"You are over complicating it...  I run a 100 yrds or so of 10lb mono backing then fill the rest of the reel up until about an 8th of an inch from the top.  Currently running 8lb Drennan Super Specialist.  Run your mainline down to a small barrel swivel, then your flouro lead (length depends on conditions)  BTW, Siglon F is like rope, it's cool to see it in the water, but I found it a complete pain in the butt.  No matter what line you use, if you are doing a sidecast, you'll get line twist..  Unless you learn one of the other casting methods (Wallis or modified pull cast for example) it's inevitable.  Take this with a grain of salt, but this is what I've been taught."
388963,MJL,2009-10-01 15:05:00,2427,"For me in the instance where my reel has nothing on it:  I normally fill my spool ½ way with fly line backing.  Then put 75-100 yards of mono for my mainline.  Rig up my float (and whatever split shots) on the mono mainline tie a swivel at the end and then tie my leader onto the swivel.  I don’t use Hi-Vis lines but some people who do put a low-vis “shot line” beneath their float and attach it via a blood knot, double surgeon’s knot or swivel.  With the tangles you're getting, are they problems with line twist?  If so, it could be the way you spool line onto your reel or how you cast.  I spool my reel up much like a baitcaster.  Stick a pencil through the spool of line so that the spool is ""standing"" upright (not laying flat as seen when spooling up a spinning reel).  I have the line coming off the bottom of the line spool so that it winds onto the reel spool without twisting.  If you're side-casting, as Bill mentioned, that's a guarantee for line twist."
388968,troutologist,2009-10-01 15:15:00,951,I just havent had good luck with Siglon at all. Have much better success with Raven 10lb mainline. I put whatever heavy mono I have around on for backing 75yds or so.  Similar to trolling you can take all the terminal tackle off and let line float down river for a few minutes then reel in....no more twists.
388983,krawler,2009-10-01 15:50:00,167,The problem with the tangles is after a few drifts the line is loose on the reel.  The line doesnt come off smoothly and often comes out in a tangle.  Could be im side casting.  Im running dackron for backing.  Any reason why people suggest running 20 lb braid?
389000,BillM,2009-10-01 16:25:00,17367, When reeling in after a drift I like to keep the float in the water so that there is a bit of tension on the line when it goes back on the spool....
389008,craigdritchie,2009-10-01 16:46:00,1586,"As others have noted, side casts generally mean tangles, and usually within a few minutes. If you can learn to Walllis cast (i.e. line peels off the spool as it rotates, as opposed to off the end like a spinning reel) you'll eliminate the problem. Learning to Wallis cast is a pain in the butt, and you will experience some incredible birdnests as you get the hang of it, but in the long term, that's the best answer. It's a bit like learning to use a baitcasting reel. In the end, it's worth it.  As far as the line setup goes, I agree you're probably over-complicating things. Since you'll still be picking out a few backlashes in the weeks to come, why not make your life simpler by just running some straight six pound mono all the way to the hook? When you get a backlash, you cut if off, stuff the dead line in your pocket, retie and you're back fishing in a few seconds - as opposed to screwing around with swivels and fluoro leaders and blood knots and all that other extra crap. You may hook one or two fewer fish by not having the fluoro leader, but then again you'll probably hook one or two extra fish by actually having your bait in the water, instead of spending so much time re-rigging. In the end, it will probably balance out. You'll spend more time fishing and less time knitting.  Once you become comfortable with the Wallis casting, and have largely eliminated the tangling issue, then you can worry about experimenting with specific setups."
389059,krawler,2009-10-01 19:07:00,167,"Most of time i reel my line in, i keep the float in the water to add extra tension but it always seems as though the line is still loose on the reel.  Is this because of the side cast or the way i spool my line on the reel?"
389083,BillM,2009-10-01 20:07:00,17367,"If it's still loose, grab a hold of it with your finger and apply tension that way..."
389099,muddler,2009-10-01 20:55:00,623,"I fill all 4 of my AngSpes offset pins the same way.  1. Fill half way with 12 lb dacron. Bought 200 yd spool from Cabela's years ago. Attach to reel with a uni knot or arbour knot  2. Attach mono running line (about 100 yds of 4 kg (8.8 lb) Ande) to the dacron. Fill reel to 1/8 inch of the edge of the reel. Use two uni knots for joining lines.  3. Attach leader to running line using Orvis tippet knot.  Best knot I found for joining tippet to mainline.  4 Thread on surgical tubing for float and tie on hook/fly/jig using Orvis knot(again the strongest knot I tested).  Good to go now.  On the stream I put on some sticky weight (from Cabelas-moldable tugsten weight, and it's removable).  Put weight on at the junction of the running line and floro leader. If the weight get caught on bottom , just pull gently and it is flexable and it usually rips free, often still haging on to the main line.  As for tangles. I don't cast too much on the eastern tribs. a simple lob with 10 feet of line hanging from the tip of the rod and a little slack from the reel at my feet and a 20-30 foot flip is easily possible. Other wise a side cast will do. If ther is little or no wind a Walis cast works for me, but in windy conditions a sidecast works best for me.  The side casts will eventually put a lot of twists in the main line. At the end of the day I just take off all the hardware (hook/fly/jig sticky weight and float and tubing) and let the line float down stream to my maximum casting distance. Hold the rod downstream and let the water pressure untwist the line. Spin fishermen do this in a boat after a days fishing to remove twists in thier lines too. Reel it all back in and you're set for the next trip. Takes 5-10 minutes.  The two Orvis knots mentioned above are by far the best knot I have ever used. I use the all the time for 10lb or less lines/tippet. Thy don't look like much, but they have the best holding power of all the knots I have tried. My test was a simple one. Take a mediun barrel swivel and tie one knot to one end of the swivel and  the Orvis knot to the other end. Put on a pair of leather work glove on a bd wrap the loose ends aroung your hands. Pull firmly and steadily until one knot breaks. The Orvis knot won out like 90% of the time. It very easy and quic to tie.  Give it a try, you may just be surprised. Same goes for the Orvis tippet knot. Simple, fast and super strong. I even tie my braid to floro using this knot. Excellent results.  muddler"
389281,azebra,2009-10-02 11:52:00,168,"my reel is just over half spooled .. 6lb line. gel spun backing. im new to centerpin angling, last year new. but I was told to never ever side cast. people say most people do it, its easy... etc... well. personally I like the challenge. I only wallis cast. now I couldn't side cast if my life depended on it, and nothing depends on a side pull.. learn the wallis, no twist. and a beautiful form.*flow* it looks."
389293,BillM,2009-10-02 13:30:00,17367," You have more patience then me!  Although, can you get the distance with a Wallis that you can with a side cast?"
