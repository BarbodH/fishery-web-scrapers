388374,soma56,2009-09-30 00:36:00,16,"Well, I skunked with the Walleye but caught some nice large mouth and endless perch. The perch are much smaller then Simcoe but the large mouth bass had very unique/silvery skin unlike Little Lake in Barrie or Lake Simcoe. I think it's really cool that muskies are there without the hindrance of pike as pike spawn much earlier and tend to decrease the number of muskies in any lake.  BTW - I met the Causeway Bait and Tackle shop guy. You guys were right, he's pretty cool.  I'll be heading out again this Saturday, somewhere more north were there's not as much pressure. Again, I appreciate everyone's insight negative, positive or otherwise"

Fish-miester – I’m going to hit one of my secret holes for pike. Every time I’ve been there I’ve always caught a large pike anywhere from 5-7pounds."

382754,soma56,2009-09-13 21:31:00,16,"Hey guys, I need some advice on fishing for Walleye in Lake Scugog. Not so much on how to fish but rather two specific questions:  1. As I'm coming from the central west towards lake Scugog, where would the best place to launch be? I have a 12 foot aluminum boat w/o a trailer so a traditional or otherwise regular boat launch isn't necessary. I've yanked my boat into all sorts of places. I guess 'free' and 'parking' would be ideal.  2. Where are the hot spots for Walleye this time of year? I know they like to remain low and in schools. I've done some research online and some 'experts' claim that the areas around Caesarea and Port Perry are the places to be in the Fall. Is there an area that you guys think I should be focusing on?  As I'll be driving an hour and a half to get there - a heads up/game plan would be nice for the day. Any advice/suggestions/feedback/stories would be appreciated."
383134,angrypigeon,2009-09-14 23:23:00,31,prepare for destruction or silence
383141,Guest skeeter99,2009-09-14 23:31:00,0,  water is down 18 inches and has not really cooled off yet to get the walleye biting  I would suggest either going bass fishing or holding off for a couple of weeks
383317,soma56,2009-09-15 04:20:00,16,Thanks for the response skeeter but I think I'll take my chances next weekend.  'Angrypigeon' not too sure what you're talking about when you say 'prepare for destruction or silence '.  Is that it? 130 views and two responses that didn't answer either of my original questions?
383321,leighfns,2009-09-15 04:46:00,103,Oh man...  now prepare to be flamed .....   I am assuming this is an account made specifically for the purpose of trolling
383324,bigugli,2009-09-15 04:57:00,6138,"As skeeter 99 said, water temps are still high so the walleye need a warm weather presentation in hopes of a few fish. Even with 130 views there really isn't much that can be added to that comment.  As for launches, the fact that you do not need a ramp is not much of an advantage as there is not a lot of public shore access for you to park and launch."
383328,Guest skeeter99,2009-09-15 06:09:00,0,"  well your ""experts"" are a litle off  it aint fall yet  so port perry and ceasarea and not going yet way way way too early, fall fishing on the bog is thanksgiving till close  so you want access points!!!  really way to many that i know on this lake  port perry  $ west shore marine $ riverview rd(nonquon) free chickadee court(north end) free port hope road(north end)  free crown land top of scugog island  free cottage road(washburn)   free Bowens road(washburn) free ceasarea government dock free cedar grove drive(ceasarea)  free scugog island marine  $ goreski's $ stephenson point road(the culvert) free spring road  (pay off tow truck driver) portview road(right at the bend) free  does this answer your questions?"

383939,soma56,2009-09-16 20:48:00,16,"That's a bit better. I can appreciate the fact that the timing/season/weather may not be perfect but I still would like to get out there and see what I can see. Thanks for everyone's response, especially skeeter on the list of marinas/launch spots (very cool). As far as everyone else complaining that I'm complaining - I don't know what to tell you. It's a forum. Yes I'm new. We exchange ideas, thoughts, experiences and stories surrounding the main purpose of the site. I guess I was expecting a more in depth and educational reply then that of the initial two. I'm satisfied now.  I'll tell you what, I'll post my results here next week either way hopefully with pictures of deep fried walleye."
383942,soma56,2009-09-16 20:54:00,16," I don't think shouting or being rude in any capacity or that by any so-called 'forum' seniority (by any amount) of posts is justified. I didn't shout nor was I rude. I just made point. And it worked in getting some attention and some feedback to initial questions. We're all here for a common purpose and interest. Mine right now is having a game plan for Sunday in lake Scugog and Walleye. How about you?  Wow, 460 Views! LMAO"

384381,smally21,2009-09-17 23:20:00,993,"good answer.  i fished scugog right after the big storms in august and it was a mess.  'locals' told me fishing was tough. only walleye i caught were in 6 feet of weeds, accidentals caught while panfishing with little nephew.  serious walleye anglers were jigging the deep channels (9feet) with natural and atificials baits. lots of trollers, worm harnesses mostly.  best bet a map - notice a deep stretch outside ceaserea and along the east arm to the river.  fish transitions between weed beds.  marked lots of fish in 14'.  launch for free in ceaserea not alot of parking, take pier street.  best advice  - talk to and buy somethig from the causeway bait shop - great guy!!!  i have also caught walleyes in the shallows a 5 am , up real shallow (4ft) feeding in the am. i was gonna pass this on the other day til you beaked off.  good luck, i found scugog a real tough lake.  dont be too concerned about the depth finder telling you 5 feet, only serious hazard is on the east shoreline north of ceaserea, marked by yellow barrels.  shoreline weeds and slop looks great but produced little."
384422,johnnyb,2009-09-18 01:20:00,3413,"The Causeway Bait and Tackle shop sells maps with hotspots marked on them, and will usually give you the heads up on where the bite's been hot. And most of the ""views"" that you see are adbots searching for keywords.  But you certainly made for an interesting intro"
384873,soma56,2009-09-19 15:06:00,16,Simply 21 - information overload. I appreciate it. You too Johnny B (I'll pick up a map). Anyone have a number for Causway bait and tackle? I only found a location in NY for the same name through a Google search.
385099,fish-miester,2009-09-20 05:43:00,864,Causeway Live Bait Port Perry ont 905-985-0707   good set of guys that run the shop and normally full of information!
387335,soma56,2009-09-26 21:24:00,16,"Thanks man. I found some great maps of Scugog. Perhaps I'll post them online in a new thread - unless they're already here or there's an appropriate spot for them. Having a look at them it seems the western side between two marina's looks like a pretty good spot. Anyways, going to hit it tomorrow. Port Perry is calling for rain all day but only 1mm, 10km/hour winds and up to 19 degrees by the afternoon.  It will be a little rough but worth it if I catch something. I've heard that live bait is the way to go. But then again I've also heard that people that use live bait swear by it. And apparently there's muskie's in there too! With no Pike in that lake that's good news for them."
387622,fish-miester,2009-09-28 12:44:00,864,dont know how you made out ? but i find i hook into or see atleast one musky while im walleye fishing between westshore and goreskies.. tho it is a good spot for both.
