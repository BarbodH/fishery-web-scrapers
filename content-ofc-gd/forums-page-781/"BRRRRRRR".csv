We endured a wind storm with speeds of 50 kmh gusting up to 70 kmh Monday that brought down trees and power lines all over the city and area, and caused a bunch of failures of equipment at our local university that we are still dealing with. I wake up a bit late this morning. Look out the window, nice and clear(should have looked at the thermometer). Get one mug of coffee into me, shower, and fly out the door, to be greeted with a -3C temperature and a car with all windows frosted over, DOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Now, where is the scraper again   :lol:  :lol:  Finally found one 5 minutes later(I have like, 6 of them around here somewhere)started the car, put heat on, rear window defroster on, scraped like mad, and got to work 4 minutes late, oh well. I'm guessing the first snow is not too far away."

388705,tjsa,2009-09-30 22:33:00,1578,"Yup, gotta love a brisk cold snap just before hunting season to get the animals moving."
388707,Bernie,2009-09-30 22:39:00,3190,Not much better here Tom. Was snowing again today but no accumulation. Just over the zero point meant no scraping.
388714,tjsa,2009-09-30 22:57:00,1578,"Oh, it was that cool down your way also Bernie? Didn't know that. I might have to put on a sweater before November gets here,  lol"
388726,misfish,2009-09-30 23:37:00,29133," We all know it,s going to be short lived. Still the Indian summer to come. Maybe."
