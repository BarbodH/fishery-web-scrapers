388149,anders,2009-09-29 14:15:00,1168,"The month of September was a great one.  Relaxing, tons of fishing, a little hunting and quality time with some of the people that mean the most.  It all started with a nice little salmon before September to get the ball rolling..   Then September can and i got to get out again on my birthday, but my brother was the one that got lucky that night   We also got luck and hit some Lake Superior eyes and a Northern from the same hole....completly stunned and shocked by the results.  We were expecting coho's or even rainbow, but when we hit these...we were in bliss  19 and 21 inch eyes   10-12lb Pike   We spent some time at our favourite places....did a little relaxing and site seeing           Then back to the mighty Mich, where, its not looking very mighty lately, but the wildlife is returning for the annual salmon run.  Got some pics of on osprey and a baldy fishing.          Gus getting ready to run after the bald eagle...who wasnt phased by his presence          Then it was back to our favourite spot were the fishing was picking up...here my greatest catch was fighting one, but soon got off   Some random shots       The last night in the rain a little more fishing to cap the month off with a lake superior chinny...man i really hate battling the crowds, parking, and traffic.      Cant wait till October now..walleye, pike, grouse, and hopefully a moose....bring it on...im relaxed and ready"
