388164,solopaddler,2009-09-29 14:52:00,8605,Wow how fortuitous. I'm looking for a place to store my boat for 5 months..Nov-Mar.
388165,Gerritt,2009-09-29 14:57:00,6129,"Albert,  As Rick says, you need to look at insurance first... Last thing you need is someone suing you if something happens to their equipment while in you're care. You will also need a contract written up for you're clients to sign... which will probably involve the hiring of a lawyer to draw it up to cover all the bases...  you are right though.. you have a great spot to do it!

388404,HTHM,2009-09-30 01:43:00,4082,The other option I have is to say that if the boat is not gone by such and such a date.....it's mine.
