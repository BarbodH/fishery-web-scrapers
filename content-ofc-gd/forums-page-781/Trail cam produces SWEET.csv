388296,Greencoachdog,2009-09-29 22:00:00,8163,"  That's a funny looking dog!!!  I love hunting season! All the idiots are off the lake and out in the woods shooting themselves and each other, falling out of their tree stands and breaking their necks and backs, or flipping their ATV's over on themselves.  .. and I have the whole lake to myself!!!"

387272,misfish,2009-09-26 15:49:00,29133,"I just knew this stand was going to produce something. The daytime shots really have me pumped,as we all know, you cant hunt in the dark.LOL  First my feathered friends.I,ll be looking for one of them this fall.          Now the shots that count.LOL          "
387273,Joey,2009-09-26 15:52:00,9122,"Hey, that's neat B.  Never knew there was such thing as a trail cam until you started posting these.  Joey"
387277,glen,2009-09-26 16:03:00,2641,All i see are eyes and deer with no heads.  Good luck with the hunt.
387284,tjsa,2009-09-26 16:54:00,1578,"Nice pics Brian, but, will they still be there when you need them to be? It's amazing how when we scout out areas, and find lots of sign, when the time comes, NOTHING, ZERO, ZIP, NO ACTIVITY.  Hope that does not happen for you though, looking forward to a successful hunting report."
387289,irishfield,2009-09-26 17:26:00,26272,..and ta think I just have to look out my window ! lol    
387291,edmichit,2009-09-26 17:43:00,145,"Misfish looks like an afternoon hunt for you...all the better. Those birds are obviously roosting close by, if they came in at that time of the day. I hunted a similar situation last fall.  Watch out for the fly down at dawn...scared the poop out of me. Good Luck with the deer. Wayne you obviously have a varmit problem that needs looked after:)"
387292,fisherman7,2009-09-26 17:45:00,325,That is very cool!

387393,Leecher,2009-09-27 01:17:00,7832,Awesome Brian Good action at the cam  When is your season opener for them birds?? Jacques
387470,LucG,2009-09-27 12:59:00,779,"Nice pics. I've had one of these cam's for a couple year's now and it has been a great tool for hunting and trapping. I just recently set it up and I've allready got some good action, but I think the best is still to come.  Here's a young buck   A doe and two fauns   A little spike horn   And this big guy has been around all summer long, I knew he'd appear eventually. Bu t I'm not sure if the is two different moose??     In two weeks I shot 345 pictures. Most of them being the same two bucks, and the doe with 2 fauns. and of course old bullwinkle."
387476,aplumma,2009-09-27 13:24:00,6896,lucG it looks like they are still in velvet? Nice picture all.   Art
387514,misfish,2009-09-27 16:47:00,29133," The fall season opens on the 13th of October and carries for 2 weeks. One bird of either sex.   Great shots there guys. I put my cam back out on the field stand.I think I had it too high the last time.  Next year I,ll be upgrading the cam,as the flash on this one sux.  4 more sleeps."
387517,richyb,2009-09-27 17:09:00,774,"  The flash is only good for like 30 feet, not yards . The pics of the deer you have they look like they are quite a distance away. My cam is the same one and the flash is very bright on a deer that is 10 feet away from the cam. Your deer are so far away they look like mice. Get them closer and then see what the pics look like. Use a pile of salt or something."
