387861,frozen-fire,2009-09-28 21:43:00,542,These were taken from a recent trip we had.  I was literally one foot away from this brave seagull!    These trout (rainbows and brook trout) were in a pond at Scenic Caves. It was great watching them come up to take pellets.          Lots of frogs in that same pond       Pretty hard to capture a monarch in flight! (taken at Sauble Falls)   THE DEVIL!!! (Sauble Falls)   Fairly small run of chinooks at The Mill Dam in Owen Sound (I was surprised how many of them had lampreys attached)     The main point of the trip was to visit The Bruce Peninsula.... Beautiful. Absolutely stunning how clear and blue the water is and the amazing scenic shoreline.
387870,Twocoda,2009-09-28 22:06:00,4130,most excellent !!! you have a good eye for photography  thanks for sharing this   the theme song from Jaws comes to mind looking at the fish
387871,Rich Clemens,2009-09-28 22:09:00,3131,"Excellent action shots of the fish.  Some folks will take dozens and dozens of pics, just to get that single 'good' shot.  Ya did quite well there."
