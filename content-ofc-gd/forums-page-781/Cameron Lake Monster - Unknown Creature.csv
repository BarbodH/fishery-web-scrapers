388380,soma56,2009-09-30 00:49:00,16,"I apologize in advanced if this is already posted somewhere. I did a search but couldn’t find it here and thought you boys might find it as interesting as I did. Apparently there have been numerous reports of ‘something large’ from Cameron Lake in British Columbia. While researching some links to post for you guys here – I realized it was B.C., not Ontario, a shame as I would have almost considered driving out there. I caught a bit of it on the radio the other day and found these new reports online:  hxxp://www.bclocalnews.com/vancouver_island_central/parksville_qualicumbeachnews/news/60056822.html  hxxp://farshores.org/c07mon10.htm  I didn't come here to promote any other sites so replace the 'xx' at the beginning of the links above with 'tt'. Pm me if you don't understand or if you having issues.  What do you guys think?  Apparently they sent in a 'scientific team' to investigate. Hmm, what could it be?"

388457,soma56,2009-09-30 03:17:00,16,"Finally!, we could see some tax payers money put to good use! (in my opinion)...   Politics aside, the thought of some crazy large (fish?, mammal?) lurking in these waters is intriguing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not the type to stay up all night listening to 'coast to coast am' (phenomenon radio show in case you don't know) waiting for the latest psychic readings and predictions. I suspect most of you are the same - although I'm new here and really have know idea who any of you are. However, I am inclined to feel intrigued at the possibility of a new discovery. Perhaps a largest lake trout known to man? A giant squid living in the most perfect environmental conditions?  In the end it's entertaining and I hope something else surfaces whether - it's something that must be seen with your own eyes in order to believe..."
388459,soma56,2009-09-30 03:24:00,16,"Since you brought up the photoshop bit 'SNAG' I thought I would add the original Nessie image to the thread. Ironically, my my sixth great-grandfather was named after the town along the shores where this creature has been seen:    Here's some anonymous 'Nessie' information to refresh some peoples memory and perhaps for the young ones as well that may have never heard of the myth...

388490,bushart,2009-09-30 11:34:00,2628,You know Ontario has dealt with it's own lake monsters as well..  I was putting a painting together and had to research what it looked like first from archival newspaper articles---internet and even published books.  Apparently in the 70's even tv stations as far away as Los Angeles were looking into this one.  It resides in a deep long body of water in Eastern Ontario--Muskrat Lake.  Here's what I found (part of anyway)  Bushart

388522,Mike Pike,2009-09-30 13:28:00,1332,"Bushart, that is such a cool painting of the monster!!!  Nice interpretation of the legend!  I like the way you did the head since in so many reports, these things are described as having the head of a horse, etc.  I've always wished these things to be real, unless of course I'm going for a swim..."
388524,Mike Pike,2009-09-30 13:32:00,1332," Then you'd really like the latest novel by Steve Alten; ""The Loch!""  I read it when it came out in the spring and it was great!  Terrific if ya love underwater monsters!"
388570,soma56,2009-09-30 15:04:00,16,"Well I'm skeptical to believe they are 'monsters' lurking in lakes and oceans but I do think the idea of a really, really large fish is possible. For example, I'm sure you guys heard about that record Large Mouth in Japan (22 pounds, 4 ounces). Not a 'monster' per-say but a freak of nature and one out of a million. Whose to say there isn't a massive Trout in Cameron Lake that beat the odds of nature and humans?  "
