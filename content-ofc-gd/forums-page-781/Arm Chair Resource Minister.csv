In short, the salmon thread led me to think a thread where we all give suggestions could be both enlightening and entertaining!  So here she goes...If you were the Minister of Natural Resources for the province of Ontario, what would you do?  What projects would you keep?  What projects would you cancel? etc etc etc"

388855,laszlo,2009-10-01 11:07:00,487,Modify the fishing regulations for Ontario from Lake Nipissing all the way down to Lake Erie.  1) Reduce possession limits for every species 2) Add more officers 3) Increase fines for littering 4) IF YOU ARE COMPLETELY CAPABLE OF WORKING AND ARE ON WELFARE THEN YOU MUST JOIN A CLEAN UP PROGRAM FOR YOUR REGION  These are the first things that come to mind. This would just be scratching the surface.

388881,Dara,2009-10-01 12:26:00,3052,"Make a line at the French river, its already an established line so I may as well use it, and declare northern and southern Ontario. Then the southerners would require non-resident licences for fishing and hunting in the north.  They would get all the new rules they want down there and not affect the north with their population problems."

389118,splashhopper,2009-10-01 22:18:00,2931, I was wondering the same thing....
389163,danbouck,2009-10-01 23:50:00,4380, that's no good!  We went cheap on ours. 2 weeks camping in Temagami (with our 6 month old) and I wouldn't want to have gone anywhere else.
389175,Greencoachdog,2009-10-02 00:20:00,8163,"    Is it typical of Canadians to put the ""cart before the horse""???"
389187,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-02 00:44:00,0, hey!  we were engaged first! 
389204,Ziki,2009-10-02 01:14:00,128,only thing worse than worrying about politics on your honeymoon  is worrying about what someone else -you don't even know- does on their honey moon
389214,splashhopper,2009-10-02 02:06:00,2931, 1) More CO's on the rivers and lakes.  2) Review the regulations for seasons in tighter geographical locations.  3) Have an interactive website for direct communication with the ministry for ideas like we are suggesting and reporting offenders.
