I was hoping for some Steelhead action. Didn't end up hooking any but did see 3 or 4 huge ones surface. Did see another fisherman land a 7 lb female.  Total Hours Fishing - 4  Total Fish Landed - 6  Biggest Fish - 16"" Smallmouth Bass & 17"" Walleye   The only picture worthy. I didn't get a pic the 17"" Walleye because I was in the middle of the river and only pull the camera out over land or close to it.      Overall a good day. That smallie isn't the longest one I've caught in this river but it may have been the heaviest. The pic may not show it well but it had a big belly.  Till next week..."

389390,laszlo,2009-10-02 16:41:00,487,Thanks guys. I've been doing the live release shots lately and I think I'm going to do them more often. They seem to turn out nice when showing the fishes face just out of the water.  Here are a couple more from this year.
