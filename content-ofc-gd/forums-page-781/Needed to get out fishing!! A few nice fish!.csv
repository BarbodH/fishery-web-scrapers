389128,Bly,2009-10-01 22:36:00,1556,Doh!   I was referring to Cliff's being called on his little fib......     Clearly I need to use the preview post feature a little more often.   Thanks Wayne lol
389132,jaydub,2009-10-01 22:40:00,145,A couple of very nice fish there!  Congrats to you Bly on the beauty Salmon!!
389134,irishfield,2009-10-01 22:42:00,26272,Yah I answered that one toooo ! lol  I'm sure there were other tales told at your house yesterday!
389136,Bly,2009-10-01 22:45:00,1556,
389153,Greencoachdog,2009-10-01 23:29:00,8163,  Do you hear that???   ... the sound of silence!
389156,irishfield,2009-10-01 23:34:00,26272,Yep... my wife and bly was together yesterday and why I asked Dawg.
389164,Greencoachdog,2009-10-01 23:50:00,8163,  ... oh to be a fly on the wall eh!!!
389212,splashhopper,2009-10-02 01:57:00,2931,"  No problem Bly....  YOU are THE reason I DON""T take my own wife fishing.... i would end up like Cliff   He is always putting a positive spin on having his butt kicked by you while fishing  lol  Just kidding cliff.... no really... JUST KIDDING"
389223,ccmtcanada,2009-10-02 02:35:00,7971,"LOL...I have fully accepted the fact that I get outfished by the women in my house.  Someone has to net the fish...may as well be me!!  Splash...was wondering if anyone would catch that...LOL.  And Wayne...she wont tell me what they talked about...I said ""Was it about Wayne""...she just laughs and turns away..."
389225,splashhopper,2009-10-02 02:40:00,2931, Botbot kicks my butt every time we go too Cliff.... it's all about the NUMBERS to her.... size don't matter... it's numbers...lol
387472,ccmtcanada,2009-09-27 13:07:00,7971,"Friday was a very busy day for me.  My flight took off from Beirut, Lebanon at just past midnight...early Friday morning Toronto time.  I was in Switzerland by 4am...then onto Montreal and finally Toronto.  I landed at 5pm and finally got home around 7pm.  To say I was a little tired is a bit of an understatement!  Anyhow, after a good night's sleep Friday, I was itching to get out and do some fishing...but the weather forecast wasn't looking all that great.  Small craft advisory for the evening...windy...rain...but all afternoon long, it held off.  We decided to launch in a local harbour, hopefully protected from the winds...and see what we could tease.  We were on the water by 5pm...looking for some Salmon that may be in the area.  The fish finder was marking all kinds of fish, but we couldn't entice many hits, but we did manage a few fish.  Trolling along in 8 to 10 feet of water, I felt a hit!  It wasn't a salmon, but it was giving some pretty good headshakes.  Turns out it was an ok sized pike...not very long, but had some girth on it...this one had been busy gorging for the fall/winter!  The most interesting thing about this one was the blue tinge to it...especially in and around the mouth...here's a few pictures.     The winds and rain did pick up...so trolling got very difficult...so we decided to set up drifts...still hoping to see a salmon.  About a half hour before we were going to call it a night, Bly yells ""Fish On!"".  This one peeled line....so we knew it was what we were looking for.  A 10 minute fight bringing it back in and she landed a nice 38"", 19 pound salmon.   Who knows...maybe we'll try again tonight, since I took Monday off to ""recover from jet lag"" from my business trip."
387474,LucG,2009-09-27 13:14:00,779,Looks wet and cold! Nice fish regardless. That blue tinge is quite odd. I can't say I've seen that before.
387477,Greencoachdog,2009-09-27 13:28:00,8163,A couple of excellent fish there for you and bly Cliff!!!  Man that looks cold up there!!! brrrrrrrrrrrrrr! I'll bet that cold weather was like a slap in the face after being nice and warm for 2 weeks eh!  Thanks for taking the time to post that nice report!
387505,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-27 15:56:00,3761,"Nice y'all! You two seem to always impress.  Great catch and thanks for sharing, MTBF"
387549,Leecher,2009-09-27 20:03:00,7832,Great report and pics Cliff Must feel real good to get back on home waters and getting into some beauties!!!  Looks like Bly kicked your ass once again   :lol: Great job you guys and keep up the good work!!! Leechman
387551,tibbs,2009-09-27 20:09:00,650,Nice Job!
387563,Weeds,2009-09-27 21:21:00,782,"Nice to have you back CC, feel good to be home?"
387569,Radnine,2009-09-27 21:41:00,1538,"Isn't it amazing that you just spent time in a place where women can't even show their face, only to come home and have your fishing behind kicked by one. Is this a great country or what? Jim"
387572,ccmtcanada,2009-09-27 21:43:00,7971,Hey now...we were targeting Pike...how did she outfish me?? LOL.
387573,ccmtcanada,2009-09-27 21:43:00,7971,Thanks everyone...it's good to be back!!!
387574,irishfield,2009-09-27 21:45:00,26272, Same way she always does..... she just looks better holding a fish than you do Cliff !!
387581,backbay,2009-09-27 22:01:00,773,"That's a nice fat pike ccmt! It's interesting that the harbour pike look like the European strains, with larger yellow markings than the ones we usually see up north."
387667,wolfville,2009-09-28 14:55:00,396,"Good stuff ! You attest to the saying ""Live to fish""."
387678,frozen-fire,2009-09-28 15:12:00,542,Great report Cliff...glad to see you back fishing.
387708,legacey,2009-09-28 16:15:00,127,I caught a pike that looked very similar in the Bay of Quinte last year....  Extremely blue mouth...even more so than yours and a tinge to the colour on the body too.  Looked like it was eating blue berries for a month.  I'd love to know why this is.  Cheers
387849,splashhopper,2009-09-28 21:18:00,2931,ummmm Cliiiiifffff... Bly KICKED BUTT AGAIN  Do you need a hug ?
387866,Greencoachdog,2009-09-28 22:02:00,8163,"... btw Cliff, what did that Pike hit?... a trolled HJ?... and how far back from the boat were you running it?  I ask these questions because it would be nice if some day I caught a Pike like that!"
388135,snag,2009-09-29 13:29:00,1932,I believe that pike ate a blue Jawbreaker  
388255,corvette1,2009-09-29 19:53:00,1765,nice fish cliff
388564,ehg,2009-09-30 14:51:00,2666,Great report as usual Cliff  Hoping to see some of those monster walleyes you catch in next while or so...  Good stuff as usual!
388571,bigugli,2009-09-30 15:09:00,6138,"Who cares if the Mrs has a habit of whoopin yer sorry arse. Most fellas are droolin because they wish they had a wife half as good as yours.  You get to fish all the time, Heck, Bly probably has to kick you out of bed to get moving on the next fishing adventure."
388621,bigbuck,2009-09-30 18:11:00,2449,"Yeah, I hate fishing with my wife as well since she usually kicks my arse all over the place too..........mind you, I spend all my time unhooking  her fish for her so I do get to fish less but that's no excuse. Nice report and welcome back from the Pearl of the Med."
388781,splashhopper,2009-10-01 01:25:00,2931,"  ummm Cliiffffff:  Your opening posts says>>> ""We decided to launch in a local harbour, hopefully protected from the winds...and see what we could tease. We were on the water by 5pm...looking for some Salmon that may be in the area. The fish finder was marking all kinds of fish, but we couldn't entice many hits, but we did manage a few fish.""....  so... MAN UP  and admit it... BLY KICKED YER BUTT AGAIN  want that hug now? lol"
389122,Bly,2009-10-01 22:25:00,1556, Was wondering if anyone was going to call him on this  LOL  Thanks!
389126,irishfield,2009-10-01 22:27:00,26272,I thought we all did....
