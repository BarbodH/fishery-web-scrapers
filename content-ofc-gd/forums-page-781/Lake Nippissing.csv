This will probably be the last trip for the father in law as he just can't handle the cold like he use to. Hope he enjoys it this year, even with all the rain they are calling for.  Just wondering how the fishing has been lately and if the walleye have moved in to the shallower water yet. I would like to try for some musky and pike this year just for the fun of getting onto something a little more scrapier! Any tips would be greatly appreciated. PM me if you feel that is a more appropriate way.  Thanks guys and will post the pics when I get back.  Rob C"
