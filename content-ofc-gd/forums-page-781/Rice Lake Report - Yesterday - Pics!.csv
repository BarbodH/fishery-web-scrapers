Even saw some frost on the grass and roof's on 2 of the days...burr....after 3 months in shorts and sandals I finally broke out and wore the socks and runners again.  Yesterday I had a father and son out on Rice lake for the day and not only was it cold in the morning, but we arrived at the ramp the lake was still socked-in with really thick fog with maybe 100ft visability. I have come to rely on the accuracy of my GPS mapping units over the years so we headed out on a slow plane to our 1st stop approx. 4KM away and the fog was still thick and you could see no shoreline anywhere.  Moving in quietly to the shallow rock/weed edge with the electric motor we started throwing jerkbaits and tube jigs and on his 3rd cast with the tube the young lad tied into a beauti Rice Smallie! As you can see the fog was still extremely thick at that point.   After catching 2 more decent fish there we moved to another area down the lake as the fog was just starting to lift in places. Checked out 2 other spots and only got 2 Largemouth in the 1.5 to 2lb range then on the run again. We spent the rest of the day fishing various deep rock flats/humps and rock/weed or sand/weed areas for smallies and caught good fish from 4 to 18' of water. 1 big fish was taken using a drop-shot rig, 3 on the jerkbaits but the best pattern today was either popping or slowly dragging a tube jig along the bottom. The fish were grabbing the jig very lightly so really focussing on the line and feel was key to ensure a quick hookset.  As the day progressed the sun came out and it was another awesome day on the water. Here is a pic of a couple of nice picture fish caught throughout the day before they were released back into the lake.    Still lots of great fishing to be had out there before the snow flies so get out there and enjoy the action.  As always... Be safe and Good luck! .... Greg."

388672,Slayingm,2009-09-30 20:59:00,204,"  Chandru,  I would plan on heading up for sure.... Rice is not only a awesome Bass fishery but the Walleye action is starting to heat up and will continue todo so over the next couple of weeks.  Working deep cranks, bucktails and grubs off the deep weedlines all work great!.... Greg."
