Now as a rep for the ""Henpecked Husbands Union"", Local 112, its time to impart the guys ""secret"" to a happy marriage.  Three simple rules to remember:  1)  Yes Dear  2)  No Dear  3)  Anytning you say Dear.  Remember them, use them. When practiced effectively you can either butter her up or drive her to frustration in under 30 seconds   It's all in how you say it"
