388653,misfish,2009-09-30 20:16:00,29133,"Having a conversation with a friend,he tells me his anterless tag for the bow hunt is not a peel affix tag. The ones I have always gotten,you remove the sticky and place it on your deer tag.   Any ideas?   Thanks"
388657,bassjnkie,2009-09-30 20:24:00,1101,"The BOW doe tag is a separate seal/tag that  for me I have to call in to buy without applying, first come first serve. The anterless tag you have to apply and you get a sticker that you affix on your seal. But that is for non bow and non controlled."
388662,misfish,2009-09-30 20:33:00,29133,So that is DOE only? Bow only?
388669,Terry,2009-09-30 20:53:00,14456,Doe       a Deer        a Female Deer
388671,misfish,2009-09-30 20:57:00,29133,"  Yes Terry, we noe that.LOL"
388675,misfish,2009-09-30 21:08:00,29133,"The tag I apply for, is anterless for bow only. I got an anterless tag which I have  affix to my deer tag. You can apply for anterless only? Confussed just like my friend."
388681,maurizio,2009-09-30 21:27:00,10,"I was on hunting forum with almost the same question being asked, and 3 pages later everyone seems to be confused  . Gotta love the hunting regs, the literature has me reading like Iwas 3 years old.  Sorry I can't be of any help!"
388744,Rob,2009-09-30 23:55:00,467, The SIMPSONS!!!!!!!!!!!!
388777,Bondar,2009-10-01 01:18:00,817,i didnt think it mattered how you take your deer weither it be in bow season or rifle season my tag has the small sticker you put on your outdoors card and than on that same piece is a larger sticker than says that tag in eligible for antlerless in area (whatever) which you affix to your deer after you get it
388783,misfish,2009-10-01 01:34:00,29133," Here,there is a draw for anterless deer by bow. The bow season.You CANNOT take a anterless deer with just your deer tag. You must be drawn.You CAN take a buck with a bow with your tag.Then if you apply for the control hunt,you can only take what you have been selected to take,with a shotgun/muzzel loader only for that period of time.  All areas are different."
388793,Bondar,2009-10-01 01:52:00,817,well now im confused too lol
388862,Jay T,2009-10-01 11:44:00,282," If it is the extra tag (if you have any in your area) then it will only be for antlerless and bow only, but if you applied for the antlerless draw then it would be antlered or antlerless. I put in for the antlerless draw and got my tag and it says antlered or antlerless, my extra tag is antlered only and bow only.  This is copied of the MNR Deer Reg's  Any resident of Ontario who has a valid hunting version Outdoors Card may apply to the draw for an antlerless deer validation tag. Hunters who receive a validation tag in the draw are permitted to harvest their choice of EITHER an antlerless deer in the WMU specified on the tag OR an antlered deer anywhere in the province during the open season â€“ with the exception of during a controlled hunt. See page 61 for information on hunting during a controlled deer hunt season. Licensed hunters who do not apply to the antlerless draw, or who are not successful in the draw for an antlerless deer validation tag, may harvest an antlered deer only, anywhere in the province during the open season, with the exception of during a controlled hunt or where a hunter has an additional deer seal validated for an antlerless deer.  Hope this helps"

389082,misfish,2009-10-01 20:06:00,29133," Dan Dan Dan. No I did not apply for the rifle hunt this year. Bow and controlled hunt.  My cam battery is charging right now or I would show you. Anterless tag for bow area 76. As for the gun one,Im still waiting.  This is way to screwed up.What else is new.  Outdoorsman seams to make the most sense. Thanks for the help guys."
389251,richyb,2009-10-02 03:19:00,774,If you buy a tag at a store and then apply for a doe tag and get one you get a sticker to attach to your deer tag. If you apply on the phone your tag comes with anterless typed right on it.
