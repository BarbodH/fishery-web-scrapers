387869,fish-miester,2009-09-28 22:05:00,864,was wanting to get some fishing in on lake Simcoe hopefully this week.. but was wondering where would be a good place to start.. I will be coming from Port Perry so the south East part of the lake is ideally where I would be aiming to fish...  what is the fishing like there? as well as the structure?  as i normally only ice fish on simcoe  but this time i will be in a fully loaded 14' tin with a 15.  as for species.. Bass and or pike  thanks again a fellow angler
