388994,[email protected],2009-10-01 16:08:00,290, Thats awesome  Sounds exactly like what happened with me.  Raptorfans salmon jumped a good 3 feet out of the water and spat the hook. It was sad  I'm determined to land one. I'm going to Angling Outfitters right now on my lunch in search of a bigger net
389046,[email protected],2009-10-01 18:09:00,290,Just went to Angling Outfitters and Talked to Joslyn for about 30 minutes about Salmon Techniques and equipment.  Walked out with a bunch of new glow spoons and trebles!  I love Angling Outfitters.. such an amazing store. Worth the drive from anywhere!  Can't wait till tonight. Join me on the pier!
389080,LimbLifter,2009-10-01 20:03:00,27,Good job hooking up with a salmon.  I remember my first off the pier many years ago at Port Credit before the pier was closed to fishing - what a heart pumping rush.   I will be heading down to fishermans pier tonight.
389095,ciceri,2009-10-01 20:31:00,535,"Dress warm, brrrr... we need an ice fishing emoticon, haha."
389097,[email protected],2009-10-01 20:37:00,290, lol. It was quite cold last night. I'm going to have to bring some mittens tonight!  I'll be there probably until 2am again lol.
389106,raptorfan,2009-10-01 21:19:00,126,"damn....we are gonna have no room to fish now buddy!  Can't wait......what a rush last night was.  That chinny you had was the most beautifully coloured fish I have ever seen, thought it was a bow when I caught first glimpse."
389111,danjang,2009-10-01 21:47:00,148,"Nice report. I remember my first salmon, no fish after that has interested me. You know you did some good fishing if you feel it the next day."
389114,salmon,2009-10-01 21:56:00,334,"Congrats WTG Now you the true power of a king in open water.  Just the shear power, that is the main reason I hit the piers. I just crank the drag on my casting reels and put the boots to them. I refuse to go into the rivers.  Jose"
389124,[email protected],2009-10-01 22:27:00,290, Gotta watch a bit of the leaf game and then I'm headin out! lol
389244,CLofchik,2009-10-02 03:05:00,854,"See, aren't you glad you didn't catch it on a marshmallow?  Good deal, welcome to the nutty world of midnight pier fishing."
389361,LeXXington,2009-10-02 15:50:00,1928,Nice going
389362,[email protected],2009-10-02 15:52:00,290, lol. Yup.  I am thoroughly addicted now.  I even left halfway through the leaf game last night to go... lol.  It was so cold last night I didnt stay very long.
389405,bassfighter,2009-10-02 17:09:00,366,"Congrads to landing the fish!  Get ready for more sleepless nights during fall Salmon season for the rest of your life.  If you want the fish to reduce its fighting time so others can cast their line back into the water, try to slowly lift the fish to the surface sooner, they will stop fighting once they have inhaled some air. Enjoy a longer fight if there are less anglers around.  Once you catch more and get more confident/experience, you should be able to land those fish at yourown discression.  I was only using 10 lb mono, the advantage of the stretch is the line absorbs some shock, so both you and the fish does not get too tired. However, you need to re-tie your line everytime you land one. Using mono line also prevent the hook from bending."
388844,[email protected],2009-10-01 06:28:00,290,"All I can say is wow. I am still running off the adrenaline.  Raptorfan and I headed out to the Hamilton Harbour for the 2nd night in a row to do some salmon fishing.  We got there about 9:30-9:45 and begun casting.  We were using glow spoons, I was using one from CT, had orange specks on it, and he was using one from Angling Outfitters with a FOD drawn on it.  About 2 hours went by and didn't really have any excitement. Then we noticed the salmon starting to swell the surface of the water numerous times around our area.  I throw my spoon out super far and let it drop.. I start to reel it in very slowly..  tap ... tap... let it fall a little, reel... reel... tap... TAP... SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH.......  Never in my life have I felt a fish take my line out so fast and so powerful. It was game on....  I yelled to Raptorfan and he dropped his rod to grab the net and my LED cap light.  She was pulling like a true champ. She ran soooo far out into the lake. I had to muscle her back in.  I fought her up and down the pier. 25 minutes later, I eventually got her to the little stone house and close to the pier.  All we could say was WOW WHAT A HOG.  We tried for a good 10 minutes to get her into the net, but she was too long and the net wasn't long enough.  She seemed exhausted and started to swim on her side. At this point it was either get her off the hook now or we are keeping her.  Finally she got in the net and did one last thrash... the hook lodged itself into the net, and she pushed away and it dislodged from her jaw.  We were both just standing there in shock.... lol.  We estimated she weighed in the high 20's, closer to 30.  Unfortunately we didn't get any pictures, we were more concerned with getting her in safe or getting her off the hook safely.  Pictures are nice, but I'd rather the fish survive.  After I recovered from the battle, about 20 minutes later I was reeling in.. and I hear.. "" HERE WE GO...."" I look over and Raptorfan has hooked onto a nice one.  I dropped my rod and grabbed the net and ran over.  It fought hard and about 5 minutes into the fight, it jumped and spat the hook.  After that we continued to get a few hits, but nothing as big as those 2, and the fish stopped jumping.  I have never caught a salmon before until tonight, and that was the most intense thing I have ever done in my life.  I had 50lb braid to 25lb flouro leader to wire leader on my baitcaster. That is what I caught her on.   The drag was on full and she was still pulling line out.  I am just amazed at the raw power that a salmon has. Nothing can compare.  Anyways I just got home and I need to goto bed, but I just had to share this with you guys before I pass out...  Good Night!"
388856,Fish Farmer,2009-10-01 11:12:00,2234,"Congrats on your first  . Your HOOKED now  . I can remember my first, fishing off Bronte early 70's in my 14' tinny. I still have the Virus."
388876,Garry2Rs,2009-10-01 12:13:00,1425,Great report!
388879,MCTFisher9120,2009-10-01 12:22:00,3761,"Incredible story, I could only imagine a fight out in the lake with a Salmon...all that room to swim, must of been hard on the arms lol.  Thanks for the story, MTBF"
388889,johnnyb,2009-10-01 12:41:00,3413,
388897,bicephalic,2009-10-01 12:44:00,112,Nice job! Great report - glad you hooked in to some!
388898,anders,2009-10-01 12:46:00,1168," thats the reason why i love them so much...you will not find another fish in Ontario, except for sturgeon, that will fight as hard and powerful as the Chinook.  Awsome report..."
388908,[email protected],2009-10-01 13:12:00,290," My arms were mush after that.  I am still feeling it here at work.  I would have liked to have got a picture or two, but I'm just glad I got to experience such a thrill and that she swam away ok"
388911,Greencoachdog,2009-10-01 13:20:00,8163,It sounds like you should invest in a better net!
388913,[email protected],2009-10-01 13:24:00,290," Its a good net. The only problem is the pier is so high in the water that you have to lay down to be able to use the net. It was like 2 inches short of being a scoop and lift. http://www.canadiantire.ca/AST/browse/5/Sp...asket%2BNet.jsp   I was almost tempted to lift the fish onto the pier with the rod, but because it was so big I don't think that would have been a good idea"
388916,GBW,2009-10-01 13:31:00,8460,nice report and congrat's.
388922,canadadude,2009-10-01 13:42:00,769,"Now your hooked, it pays to invest in a long handle net for pier fishing, my net telescopes out to just over 12'. be carefull when you net a big fish lift it straight up don't try to scoop it or you'll bend the net."
388924,I'mHooked,2009-10-01 13:47:00,525," So is after dark the preferred period for having a chance at some of these guys? Does the action usually pick up after dark?  The last 2 weekends I've been down there between 6-8pm and have not had anything show. (Other than 1 seagull which was carefully unhooked to fly off and try for someone else's bait!) The others there hadn't had anything either.  I was washing some of the Red Devil & Cast Master spoons as well as some Mepps spinners (#4 with dressed trebbles) with no action.  Is a glow spoon just a spoon with glow in the dark finish, or is it an actual brand of spoon? If it glows in the dark, do you hit it with a flash light or something before casting?  Man, I don't know if I could even stay awake until midnight!    You know, being in my late 30's and all.  Having never caught a salmon before myself, I'm itchin' for my 1st report like yours!"
388928,[email protected],2009-10-01 14:09:00,290," I see most people out there at night.  As I was getting there, there were 4 guys leaving who said there were 3 salmon caught and a 6lb rainbow between 7-9pm.  Yeah a glow spoon is just a normal spoon with one side, or all of it with glow paint on it.  We bring little LED lights and charge it up every few casts.  Camera flashes work too.  I wasn't getting many hits on my Orange or Green Little Cleo Glows, but when I started using the bigger Little Cleo with Orange dots on it the action picked up considerably.  You should come out with us. I think I'm going to go back tonight lol."
388942,I'mHooked,2009-10-01 14:32:00,525,"...Appreciate the info. I don't have any glow spoons yet, guess I probably haven't needed them so much yet as I haven't done any night fishing. I'll have to pick some up today or tomorrow.  What kind of spoon size would you suggest? I would think something in the 4""-6"" range. Does this sound right? or should I include something smaller as well?  I definitely can't get out tonight, but there's potential for Friday or Saturday night!"
388946,frozen-fire,2009-10-01 14:37:00,542,"congrats on your first! did you go out and invest in better gear for this type of fishing yet?  max drag....and it still took you 25 minutes to bring it in?!?! something doesn't sound right here. I've caught many pier salmon for a few years now and have never had one do something like that...especially with 50 lb braid. I used to be able to land them no worries with 10 lb mono. Perhaps your reel is faulty? IMO, it shouldn't take that long with your current setup. Correct me if I'm wrong people."
388948,[email protected],2009-10-01 14:39:00,290,  I would get a range of them.  I caught my big one on a very large spoon. I think it was the biggest glow spoon at CT.
388951,[email protected],2009-10-01 14:40:00,290,"  Yeah. I caught her on my new baitcaster.  She fought hard for the first 15 minutes. I just let her run for the most part.  Then I started to reel in and she would try to run every couple minutes until she was pooped.  I could have brought it in faster, but I was enjoying the fight so much time just flew by"
388958,frozen-fire,2009-10-01 14:50:00,542," Oh... i see.  Try to bring them in faster... it'll increase their chances of survival if you're worried about that. Also don't want to piss other anglers off who are waiting for you to land the fish so they can get back at it (assuming they've respected your ""FISH-ON""). I know it bugs me when some dude will be running up and down the pier with the drag super loose for too long and we're all left to sit there and wait.  Good luck tonight. I hope to land one too."
388960,[email protected],2009-10-01 14:56:00,290," Yeah I know itll increase the survival rate.  I was just so excited to catch my first salmon I didn't want to rush it lol.  Now that I know how hard they fight and what to expect, I'll be able to do it a lot better next time  Come to the pier tonight! lol"
388962,canadadude,2009-10-01 15:02:00,769,"25 minutes is a long fight but maybe not if it's your first pier king, the more you hook-up the better you get at handling these freight trains. Everyone you latch on to is still a huge thrill, I got a nice big hen last week as I was falling asleep dreaming of fishing some where else, it woke me up quick"
388966,BillM,2009-10-01 15:11:00,17367,"25mins and full drag doesn't make sense.  However, I've had many battles that I thought were 25mins that turned out to be maybe 5  Congrats to the OP!"
388967,frozen-fire,2009-10-01 15:12:00,542," happens to me all the time!  Ultyma, I am way out east...not going to go to hamilton if there are piers out here too! I'm actually looking forward to hooking up with a brown and calling it my first than for the kings right now."
388969,[email protected],2009-10-01 15:16:00,290," It was full drag for the last half of the fight (for the most part).  I'm still getting used to all the gadgets on this baitcaster. But I'm convinced if I wasn't using that rod, I would have been picking up pieces of my spinning rod from the ground rather than netting a monster"
388991,ciceri,2009-10-01 15:57:00,535,"I know what you mean man, I got my first last week, and as soon as it was hooked it jumped 3 times like 4 feet out of the water, then took off up the river, all i could do was stand there with my arm out and let my drag scream."
