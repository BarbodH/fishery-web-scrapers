388038,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-29 01:54:00,0,I'll be working spanish river this coming weekend and i was wondering if any OFC'ers had any suggestions for fishing.  Cheers.
388086,ctdd2006,2009-09-29 04:30:00,531,go see some of the good folks hanging around Vance's.  The mouth to the big water around all the islands has been good as has the frenchman's bay.  Good luck.  I might just see you there.  Cheers.
388091,solopaddler,2009-09-29 09:53:00,8605,Yeah I'd be fishing the north channel. Really good walleye and pike...  The islands in front of Vance bay would be a good starting point.  There's places to rent boats if you don't have one.
388095,12footspringbok,2009-09-29 10:45:00,459,I go up there every spring with some guys from work. There is no shortage of good spots to try. Grab yourself a chart of the area you'll see what i mean. Good luck!
388388,hoosier,2009-09-30 01:01:00,29,I was up at Vance's in July. We fished mostly for pike out along the islands but wished we would have taken more time to fish for smallmouth. There are some real big ones out there.
388772,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-01 00:48:00,0,anybody do any river fishing in the area?  i'd actually be more interested in cohos and steelhead but i certainly don't know the area as a salmonid hotbed...any suggestions about that?
388774,ctdd2006,2009-10-01 01:12:00,531,I'm thinking your best and closest bet is Lauzon Creek near Algoma Mills...a 25min drive.  Wear your goggles.
388780,solopaddler,2009-10-01 01:23:00,8605,"A bit further away, but in the grand scheme of things not that far, is the Mississagi river. Just west of Blind River on the south side of the hwy there's a waterfall that slows the fish migration. It's on reserve land so you need a reserve lisence. You can pick one up right on 17 though and they're cheap. Very good spot but it can be popular..."
388785,Bob,2009-10-01 01:46:00,370,"Salmon and trout do go up the Spanish but it's a big river to find them in.  You may have better luck in the tribs.  I see guys fishing them in the Sable River at Massey and Birch Creek near Webbwood.  When I go looking for salmon from shore, I usually hit the causeway at the mouth of Lauzon Creek at Algoma Mills and pitch spoons or body baits.  You need a good wind though, anywhere from south to west.  It's shallow there and if the water is flat, you won't catch any, if you have big waves coming, it seems they'll hit almost anything.  I've not seen cohos in this area in years and chinook numbers and sizes have been down the last few years.  There's also the possibility of running into a stray Atlantic that LSSU has been stocking at the Soo in fair numbers.  The Mississauga gives up good numbers of pinks but not many chinooks.  Lots of variety there, bass, walleye, pike, channel cats, sturgeon etc.  Just a thought, it seems every once in a while, someone gets a salmon off the breakwall at the municipal marina at Spanish along with the usual North Channel variety.  Good luck to you."
388799,Whitespinnerbait,2009-10-01 02:00:00,2038,By any chance are you going up there alone..cause if you are ..I could always go over to your place and have a game of checkers with the missus ....
