388423,OhioFisherman,2009-09-30 02:03:00,6623,"Connie I may not have properly understood the comments I read on the board I was looking at, but my take was Chattanooga was trapped in the past? Drove thru it on I-75 also, a better impression of Knoxville but I am sure I just scratched the surface of either.  Also looked some more at Cookeville real estate web sites, seems like a nice town too, but a bit smaller than I would like nearby. Sort of like Medina? the basics are there, fine if you don`t do much, but I like to get my hands as dirty as I can. Just playing with tools and stuff, projects.  Right now TN sounds a lot better than Ohio, just the weather factor, can`t deal with the snow here, and the walking is going to get worse, so the time to go is as soon as I can. Just loose ends to clean up, kids got my back so I am good.  Not about to move back in with Mom, 2 brothers there already and all 3 of them may be nuts? Younger bro lives 2 miles away from them and is looking out for them. They need to be in a condo, but won`t move. Tired of talking to them about it myself. 2 dogs 3-4 cats and they can`t even take care of themselves.  Won`t move in with the older 2 daughters, they make themselves miserable, they aren`t busting up my party, LOL I am happy, don`t need or expect much. They want everything, and get bent because they can`t have it. Twisted sisters? Love them but too old for me to babysit in my condition. Besides one lives in Rhode Island, I know I am not getting near there!  LOL concealed carry? haven`t done that since I was 18-20, cleaned up my act for the most part and kept away from most trouble spots. I don`t mess with people that don`t mess with me, when I was well most knew it was a bad idea. Gotta push pretty hard to get me riled, I just figure the ones that do are stupid. Easier for me to draw a gun on paper now, but I can still shoot, just prefer to avoid incidents.  Have to see what the younger 2 kids are going to do, daughter is in college and I need to find the right way to motivate my son. A good kid and helpful but no direction. Need to get him going, either with me or something."

You should really try a big bowl of the collards!... they'll cure what ails ya, and if nothing ails you.. they'll cure that too!!!"

388473,holdfast,2009-09-30 04:12:00,1813,"Not sure if you got movers moving you but in case, a few tips.  - Try to label/Group the Boxes as close to the rooms as you can for the other end - Pay attention to what the packers put down for the condition of your effects on their Itinerary, they will over exaggerate for their benefit in case of damage - when they take things apart, insure they tape the bolts, nuts etc to the Item, Ive had movers pack the hardware in different boxes that were labeled as some thing else.  Its a nightmare as the unpackers usually can't find anything or plane ole dont even know how to put it back together.  Anything made of press-wood, good luck putting it together - All your important documents, bring them with you filed, in a file folder - Book hotels as I learned the hard way during Rodeo season in Montana with a bad case of food Poisoning and hallucinations, nice to have a second driver - Find room for a Jerry can of gas, just in case.  Bring Maps - On the other end, you never have time to go through every article that you own to check for condition insurance purposes.  Whatever is precious make sure you check before the move and during unpacking. REPORT IMMEDIATELY as the UN PACKER is your witness. - Make sure all your boxes are in the right rooms and leave room for unpacking. - Set Bed first, nice to have a good sleep.  Then do room to room  Before moving  set up your Phone, TV, Gas, Hydro etc for the other end.  Hope this helps and have a happy journey, make it a mini holiday.  Ive moved about eight time with my family including Germany. Important.  Make sure you go to the city and make sure your Property Taxes, Water etc is in order as Lawyers have a tendency to neglect or take their time. At the same time, get a phone book, contact Welcome Wagon, find out on Garbage and Recycle timings."

You would have to change your OFC handle to something like Tennesseefisherman and that is just too many letters in one name. Or even worse is FormerOhiofishermannowinTennessee  All joking aside if you do decide on a move to a more comfortable climate I wish you all the best and I'm sure your decision will work out perfectly. But I was just wondering if a drier western climate would be more comfortable?"
388509,OhioFisherman,2009-09-30 12:52:00,6623,"Holdfast, drove a truck or worked on a truck dock for more than 30 years, LOL a little experience at getting a load right. Also know the deal on filing damage claims with movers, similar to common carriers. I wouldn`t dream of carrying a jerry can of gas in my vehicles on a 450 plus mile trip, I am not afraid to stop for gas, new ride has a 35 gallon gas tank.  Homes I have been looking at on-line (new) come with all the major appliances, stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, under cabinet microwave. Just have to make sure I get a washer and dryer and have it delivered and set up. Also got info on utilities, who to contact to set up service in what area.  Really not much household stuff I plan on taking from here, LOL a dudes perspective? Stuff hanging on the walls has to be dusted, I don`t need it. If you don`t use it to cook with it doesn`t belong in the kitchen? Most of the furniture here doesn`t work for me, older, not really my tastes, not worried about leaving any of it.  Not sure how quickly I will find a suitable place, would like to have one picked out, and have changes made during construction. Wider door and hallways, ramps in and out of the house, nothing complicated to do during construction.  Have to check zoning laws, before I buy anything, I tinker, need to have a second garage or pole barn, have to make sure they are allowed, and lot is big enough and shaped right for one.  Haven`t moved much but never any issues, just like to plan ahead to avoid them.  Pikehunter, drier? Never been west of Indiana, go someplace with a water shortage? LOL Logistics, don`t want to be too far away from the kids and family, but outta here. Tennesse is like a perfect compromise for me, weather is much more livable for me with little snow, a fairly easy 8 hour drive from the majority of my family and friends.  MS has made me heat sensitive, doesn`t matter if it`s humid or dry, too hot and it`s inside for me, new place will have central air.  I can pick up maps, when I get somewhere, didn`t need any on the drive to Florida, didn`t usually need them when I went north, and don`t usually need them in my travels. Pretty aware of where I am and where I gotta go.  From me Knoxville is a straight shot, so was Florida, at least where I went, not many side moves, just tedious driving."

Stayed with the first ex in Florida for 5 weeks, Her home has a much better setup for a person that has some disability. One level, no basement, home is all pretty much wide open except for the hallway to the bedrooms an bathroom.  Foot drag and toe drop is a pretty severe problem for me, carpeting, throw rugs screw me up. Her house had all tile floors except for the bedrooms, a better plan for me, just not with her. She is very reclusive, and I can be a character. I get along fine with most people, not sure of her issues, just too many years apart for me to deal with it again. I am not rushing into anything involving wimmins!  http://knoxville.craigslist.org/reb/1394631960.html something like this will be fine."

Fried okra yep, it's good, or sliced raw and tossed into a stew as a thickener,  Sorry Paul, just figured drier air would be better. You should enjoy the Knoxville area, nice geographically with the mountains.  Could always shoot over to Dollywood to see those mountains too"
388906,OhioFisherman,2009-10-01 12:59:00,6623,"LOL Pikehunter, easy to get in trouble in the mountains, done it twice now. A quick pass thru, some time in the valleys is all I need.  Country music isn`t at the top of my list, some I like, but prefer to be on a nice quiet body of water. Chances of me going to Dollywood would be slim to none. Never even had a radio in my boat except for a weather radio, portable, most times I left it home, tried to be aware of what to expect before I headed out.  Lots of water near Knoxville, much bigger lakes(inland) than here. Big inland lake here is 3000 acres. They have a bunch over 15,000 acres, one is 128 miles long? Just flooded valleys they dammed up in the mountains for the most part? TVA lakes, Tennesse has some of the lowest electric prices in the country.

Just need a warmer climate because of my disability, less snow and ice. Just trying to get my bases covered in advance.

388153,JohnF,2009-09-29 14:25:00,3494," I'm not an American resident but I spend a lot of time down there, mostly Ohio now, with realtor relatives so I could be wrong in some of this. A lot of the relevant advice will depend on whether you're buying or renting, selling in Ohio, down-sizing, financing, etc.  As far as I know there are no major issues in moving between states money-wise although you'll want to check the applicable fees & taxes locally that apply to a real estate purchase. If you have any disability pensions are they state-based or federal? IOW is your eligibility affected? Check the prices on interstate movers if you're planning on hiring someone. When do you have to switch your car and driving permits over to the new state control?  Having just gone through a fast move myself I can tell you that going from a house to an apartment (condo) is quite a change. Where do you put all your stuff? We've got a 23x10 storage unit rented and a bunch of surplus furniture in long term storage with the moving company. My fishing gear is all stuck away in a screened storage locker in the parking floor of our condo and I have no table to work on when playing with the reels etc. My big gas bbq has become a small electric unit (no open flame units allowed on balconies) and steak on an electric just ain't the same.  Downsizing is a lot easier to say than do. We've given away so much stuff in the last month I feel like a charity.  I'm sure you've already thought of all these things but it never hurts to be reminded. Good luck with the new adventure.  JF"
388155,Mike Pike,2009-09-29 14:31:00,1332,"I dunno Paul, I'd still travel south a couple more states 'til you get to my favourite!  ( FLA )  LOL   Probably pretty expensive though.  I remember meeting a fellow on a Florida pier who moved to Florida from New York so he could go shrimping, pier fish and harvest wild berries and such.  Almost able to live off the land exclusively.  Anyhoo, good luck with your move.  I'm betting there is some good stream/river fishing in Tennessee and some great bassin'"
388156,Weekend Warrior,2009-09-29 14:33:00,27,"I have moved all over the country for school, work, etc., and the biggest piece of advice I can give is to rent if it is a new place. The last several years have proven that buying a house is not the ""fool proof"" investment most people think it is. If you rent when you get there, it won't be a big deal if you later discover that you made the wrong choice of state, town, neighbourhood, etc. You can just leave rather than lose your shirt in transaction fees on a house. If you end up liking it, you will be able to wait out the local market and buy the house that you want without needing to wait and sell your own.  A couple of times in the past few years I was almost certain that I was going to settle in a certain location, and for totally unforeseeable reasons, I had to move. Boy, was I ever glad that i rented!"
388158,solopaddler,2009-09-29 14:42:00,8605, That's excellent advice. At the very least it also gives you lots of time with no pressure to find exactly the right place to buy.

388167,OhioFisherman,2009-09-29 15:07:00,6623,"John, just bought a chevy express van the end of July, 2500 series, 10 feet of floor space behind the seats. Bought a 12x6x6 enclosed trailer with a ramp rear door in June. Just guessing most of what I plan on taking will fit in them, clothing, fishing tackle, tools, electric scooter, maybe an electric wheelchair before I move?( House sells?).  Doesn`t seem to be state income taxes on pensions or disability income, sales taxes are a bit higher, they tax food there. Property taxes lower. A wash? Not like I am Joe shopper. 30 days to change plates and registrations once you become a resident.  Planning on buying new, smaller and one level, lol on high ground not prone to flooding. 4 levels here and I hardly uses 3 of them. 2000 square feet, I can get by with 1400-1700. 4.18 acres here, I need less 75x150 100x150 would work fine.  House under construction(early) would allow me to make needed changes? wider halls and doors? ramps to enter instead of steps? Stand up shower with a built in seat instead of a bath tub or as an added feature?? Carpeting in the bedrooms only!  Most stuff here can go with the house, I can get new stuff down there? Maybe a pickup truck front end to turn into a grill?  Not that I fish much anymore but http://www.sherpaguides.com/tennessee/tenn.../tva_lakes.html fresh water close by is always a plus?"

Tampa-St.Pete area, Largo, a mile from the beach, saw the ocean - gulf. ??? big deal? not for me no interest in salt water, living 10 feet above sea level or paying 200 grand for a home that might fetch 100 grand here.  Stayed with the first ex-wife, in her house, nice place I guess but a 60`s era home? Room for 1 car in the drive with out blocking the sidewalk, lol my van and trailer parked on the grass on either side of the drive and no room to expand. Way too much traffic in that area and no jobs. Not only gators but poisonous snakes in the area, in the city. Ex stepped on a pygmy rattlesnakes a couple of years ago cutting her front grass, 2 people in Tampa bit by them, in their yards while I was there. I saw 2 black racers(snakes) in the ex`s yard while I was there, 1 about 3 feet 1 about 5, not poisonous but a bit of a surprise?  Just seemed like loads of scammers down there, 3 trips by a supposedly reputable heating and air conditioning place to get the ex`s new central air to pass inspection?

My youngest is going to Ohio State`s (ATI) in Wooster Ohio, but UT in Knoxville supposedly has one of the best vet programs in the country, in case she would want to follow dad.

The Knoxville area seems to get less than 1/4 the snow we get here, I can handle that. Really need to stay fairly close to the kids(relatively) I don`t fly and 18-20 hours drives aren`t my favorite items, for any reason.

Had lunch near Crossville last Thursday at Cumberland Mountain State Park Restaurant.  Thursday is pork chop day.  Yum.  Saw some Canada geese at the lake.  I'm pretty sure the lake is stocked with rainbows.  New gun law allows carry in the park for those of us who don't fight with our hands.  Chattanooga has become a pretty decent city in the past few years.  It needed to upscale.  Paul, not sure what you mean about Chattanooga not being progressive.  Is progressive a buzz word for something I don't understand?  Cookeville is not a bad little city.  We're close to three lakes, it's a university town and we have an excellent hospital.  Our cost of living and quality of life make it attractive.  Being on the edge of the plateau we seem to sometimes hold onto some stagnant air.  Or that might be my imagination.  14 miles to the East puts you up the mountain to Monterey and I really think the air quality is better there.  They sometimes get a half dozen snows a year while Cookeville gets none.  Although I've lived here since 1965 I'm still not fond of our hot July and August weather.  The humid air just won't go away.  We don't get much snow, but it's usually pretty slick.  And the home growns have no idea how to drive in it."
