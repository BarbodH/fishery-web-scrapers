382797,splashhopper,2009-09-13 23:54:00,2931,in the big tank at Bass Pro shops
382803,farsider,2009-09-14 00:21:00,456,"Big Al's on Dundas used to have them  Cheers, Mark"
382813,MCTFisher9120,2009-09-14 01:05:00,3761,"Not sure if there In Lake O but It's hard to fish specifically for them. Watch Dave Mercer's FOF The Show, he had a episode on them fly fishing.  MTBF"
382816,Jen,2009-09-14 01:15:00,833,"The Gar Pike was the one fish I put on my list to catch and mount this year... and I didn't get one... They can be found in the lower grand, seen in Lake Erie often... but hard to catch... Good Luck"
382818,jubaitca,2009-09-14 01:16:00,12,"I saw quite a number of them on trent river near belleville. But, that was during the summer and it probably close to a 2hrs drive from Toronto...that's all I can think of."
382842,Greencoachdog,2009-09-14 02:09:00,8163,"Is there actually a fish classified as a ""Gar Pike""???... as the GAR is of the family Lepisotiedae and the Pike is of the family of Esociade!!! Maybe you want to catch a Mophodite that' want's to be a Gar or a Pike???"
382843,ehg,2009-09-14 02:09:00,2666,"I caught a gar on a jigging rap while icefishing on Quinte off of Trenton years ago. Have seen them there near the surface off Twelve o'Clock Point many times, which could be an hour and half down the 401."
382906,smally21,2009-09-14 11:46:00,993,"i see them around longpoint while fishing largemouth and pike around the grassy areas.  between pottohawk and bluff bar. lots of that water is closed off for fishing now.  they seem to be in little cruising groups, never caught one."
382965,Lunker777,2009-09-14 15:29:00,866,"I cant help with a location.... but what type of fishing are you going to do for them ?  I think fly fishing is the only way to TARGET them.... you might catch them by accident on other methods.... but on rondeau they are EVERYWHERE in the little back bays.... I've actually tapped one on the nose a few times... i was trying to point the fish out to my GF and since shes blind she didn't see it. I would say it was about 3 ft or so... Like I said, they are everywhere in the bay... neat fish  But I was told that fly fishing is the best way to fish for them...not sure though. Good luck ! post pics if ya get into'em"
383036,leighfns,2009-09-14 19:38:00,103,Loads of them in BOQ right now....   Saw a huge school of them on the shoal between Snake Island and the Bakelite plant the other day.
383058,boddah,2009-09-14 20:12:00,61,"never caught one but want too.  a friend caught them in boq near trenton.  a good lure to use is just a piece of nylon rope,  open it up so that it is all frayed and their teeth will get stuck.  i think i heard of this idea on this forum"
388865,britor,2009-10-01 11:52:00,1,"I know 3 spots Moira, lake, Stocco Lake, and Quinte in hay bay just west of Pickeral park.......Used quick strike rigs, under a bobby w larg minnow>>>.Stocco Lake is excellant 20 fish days when the weather is right  in an area known as whale back rock.....exciting fishing watching your bobber swimm spo fast, although you do go through quite a bit of gear from those beaks"
388867,Spiel,2009-10-01 11:59:00,9065, BINGO! Give the man a cigar. It's simply Gar.
388893,OhioFisherman,2009-10-01 12:43:00,6623,"A good deal farther than you want to go but a lot of them on the back waters of the Georgian bay like around Pointe Au Baril. I certainly wouldn`t travel to far to fish for them intentionally. Just my opinion a Northern Pike of comparable size gives a much better fight.  Caught a number of them up there over the years using big minnows, chubs, fishing for pike, walleye. Biggest was over 40 inches but just not impressed with the fight."
388980,dave524,2009-10-01 15:44:00,4508," I'll back up Stocco Lake, went there musky fishing with a friend who was in the air force at Trenton a few times. Seemed like every run from one spot to another at high speed we would see these pods of gar floating just below the surface."
