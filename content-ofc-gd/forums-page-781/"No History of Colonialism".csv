388813,blarg,2009-10-01 03:31:00,289,"My ancestors were a victim of colonization many times, having a mix of scottish/irish/english/french and who knows what else blood, i wonder how many times the lands and nations of my ancestors changed hands, and how many people died in those wars.  Why is it that the suffering of my and all of our ancestors is irrelevant, no one is offering me a cheque every month to compensate for their suffering, but then i'm just an evil white guy.  Conquest and colonization was and to some extent still is the way of the world, the native people of this continent did the same to each other countless years before the white folks got here, so do the Iroqiuos compensate the Hurons every month, or is it the other way around?  Anyone ever here about the theory theat the greenland inuit invaded northern canada and killed the other inuit ( a distinct and seperate group), in other words the inuit living in the north now are colonists themselves, how do they compensate those they stole their land from seeing as they allegedly killed all of them?  By no means did the 'native' north americans get an easy ride, but then in many other parts of the world conquered people have been and still do get treated much much worse, in some cases eradicated.  But what is this need for self loathing amognst some Canadians about this issue? Conquest and violence is the way of the world, how far back do we have to go to compensate and apologize to specific groups, at some point we have all been victimized by this cycle, at least ancestrally.  What do we have to do to make amends for all of the terrible things we've done that have resulted in a nation that so many people are desperate to move to?  THE WORLD ISN'T FAIR. But if I had to be a conquered people I'd rather live tax free with free money in one of the best countries in the world than say..well almost anywhere else, Canada must be one of the very few places in the world where the conquerers pay the bills of the conquered while the conquered do nothing but demand more and more and more, there is only one explanation i can see for this, liberal guilt, it's so Ontario.  Maybe harper is technically right, or wrong, but so what?  My ancestors played the game just like everyone else, they lost some and they won some, there is nothing to apologize for."

388820,holdfast,2009-10-01 03:46:00,1813, It has everything to do with what you said in your opening sentence.  Only I am not bashing My Prime Minister in public with innuendo.  My statement is a fact. http://www.thestar.com/News/Canada/article/588670  Whos the Racist anyways and what are the Racist comments.  Its getting too easy pulling that card out eh.
388823,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-10-01 03:49:00,0,"k...so separatists have what to do with harper being ignorant? don't get me wrong, i REALLY don't like the separatists and my Canada includes Quebec but you totally changed the subject....  and nothing i said was innuendo...go and GOOGLE ""harper colonialism"" and see how many news agencies have covered this blunder..  given how you are a proud canadian you'd think once and a while you'd side with your country and not your party...  this comment is embarrassing for all of us, regardless of our political affiliation."
388841,holdfast,2009-10-01 06:18:00,1813,"My statement has absolutely nothing to do with Harper or a Party, however if you wipe that fog in front of your eyes, you will notice that I stated that the real threat to what you said QUOTE....That our Country has no History of Colonialsim  Would be the Spineless, Gutless, Government officials like Andre Jeaneau who is in the  position to to uphold our History had the gull to bow down to sovereigntists groups, because they found reliving the re-enactment offensive. BOO HOO  I think your Rant should be focused on the real threat to Colonial History in Canada ( if you really care) instead of the Harper Bashing, which I think was your real motive.   Unless  your like the ( The Sovereigntists) I""ll say it, Its because they are English Haters that are sensitive to true history and will deny or forcefully hide the fact that the Brits beat the French and consequently ruled. Get over it. Also I forgot, it seems that it is a sin in Canada to be proud of your Nation and feel any Nationalism from what I heard.  I think there is a real problem here in parts of this country that is spreading like wild fire.  Do you think. I haven't heard of your Harper Quote as I'm sure it would of been spewed on the CBC and Toronto's Yahoo because I'm sure the biased press would of sensationalised it.  So it sounds fishy to me. Let me check though, it would of been not the first time Harper opened his mouth to the wrong people.  LOL, I guess he cant hide his so called hidden agenda."
388845,holdfast,2009-10-01 06:30:00,1813,"Ah for Pete sakes Doc, worry about your Honeymoon Kid, I just took your advice and googled.  Tambos comments hit the nail.  Not to stress.....NO WAFER GATE on this one ."

388857,Chris,2009-10-01 11:32:00,405," Who's really the one using semantics here? Maybe it's time to take a look in the mirror Doc. Just like many others on the left of center, maybe you are desparately looking for something to hang Harper with, especially after yet another Liberal implosion with the resignation of Denis Codere. Is that what really triggered this thread?  In the end, they are all the same anyways.....slimey little puppets for big business and the wealthy."

388612,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-30 17:53:00,0,"So, our PM recently told the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh that our country has no history of colonialism.  I can't believe our PM would have the gall to make such a ludicrous and arrogant (not to mention entirely inaccurate) statement.  How exactly do we, one of the greatest countries in the free world, have a man who will misrepresent history and insult the intelligence of the global community so badly.  And this a year after apologizing for all those NON-COLONIAL residential schools that scar the recent memory.  This isn't too far off that nutjob in Iran denying the holocaust!  I mean, the colonizing of North America was a physical and cultural genocide! Sorry for my rant, I just can't believe our leader just embarrassed us in front of the global community like that."
388614,bushart,2009-09-30 17:59:00,2628,I hear ya doc....  But just like the onset of an election...the Conservative Mothership will send out the signal to its followers to jump all over this one...good luck  Bushart
388616,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-30 18:04:00,0,"this shouldn't have to do with being a conservative.  admittedly i am not a supporter, but my conservative friends know what colonialism means.  i would hope pride in our country comes before pride of a party."
388617,Headhunter,2009-09-30 18:05:00,5703,"No offense meant Doc, but shouldn't you be holed up somewhere with your lovely bride, discussing your own colonialism? I know I would! LOL HH"

388622,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-30 18:19:00,0,  You raise a good point!
388667,tambo,2009-09-30 20:51:00,85,"you're looking at a completely different issue.  Canada herself has been a 'colony' up until recent decades.  We have never had formal 'colonies', we have been the colony.  The PM is not denying history, just abiding by the classical definition of colonialism.  Canada does have plenty of skeletons in the closet, the one you mention being arguably the most dispicable Tambo"
388680,JohnF,2009-09-30 21:27:00,3494, Good catch.  JF
388686,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-30 21:44:00,0," if only semantics were a sport, you'd be a star player!  you can't say we have no history of colonialism if it was part of forming our ""colony"". trying to be ""slick"" and suggesting that our colonialism wasn't canada, but was in fact the brits or the french is just plain silly.  the Indian act itself was a colonial legistlation passed by Canada."
388691,JohnF,2009-09-30 21:53:00,3494, But isn't the point what Mr. Harper meant? Perhaps what he's really guilty of is not saying things clearly enuf for everyone to understand.  JF
388695,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-30 22:02:00,0,"no.  he's guilty of suggesting that we have no history of colonialism, when our nation was founded in it."
388698,Twocoda,2009-09-30 22:10:00,4130,dude gets married and now he wants to complain about the government ( all growed up now!)....lol....doc wait until your 50 ish for this crap ....call room service and rest up for the next round ...  cheers

388700,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-09-30 22:17:00,0,i'm married now.  i thought i was supposed to beg for it now? hehehe
388711,bigfish1965,2009-09-30 22:44:00,3382,"Well, if he means we have no history of colonizing OTHER countries, yes that is true. But we did colonialize Canada..but it wasn't Canada then..soooo... I guess he is technically right."
388721,JohnF,2009-09-30 23:15:00,3494," Strictly speaking the Brits and the French colonized what became Canada. Canada hasn't colonized anything since it came into being. Ergo no history of colonialization.  However, I looked up the word in an online dictionary and got this -  co⋅lo⋅ni⋅al⋅i⋅za⋅tion  /kəˌloʊniələˈzeɪʃən/  Show Spelled Pronunciation [kuh-loh-nee-uh-luh-zey-shuhn]  Show IPA –noun 1. the act of bringing into subjection or subjugation by colonializing.  Now, if it had stopped right there I'd have to say Mr. Harper was treated unfairly here. However, it went on to say this -  2. the state or fact of being colonialized.  Here is where a semanticist could have a little fun. I'm not saying I agree with this part of the definition (based on my own understanding of the word) but arguably at first glance the second line makes Mr.Harper a liar.  JF"
388722,JohnF,2009-09-30 23:19:00,3494,Here's one that says it better -  colonialism - Definition  [kə-lṓnē-ə-lĭźəm] (n.) A policy by which a nation maintains or extends its control over foreign dependencies.  Dictionary.com · The American Heritage® Dictionary  This is I believe what Mr.Harper was talking about. Of course one would need to see the context to be sure.  JF

388770,Jonny,2009-10-01 00:44:00,1380,"Remember to whom the remark was addressed - the members of the G20, many of whom DO have a history of colonialism, so I doubt whether there are any semantic qualms involved in how they understood it.  This is a non-issue, IMO."
388795,holdfast,2009-10-01 01:56:00,1813," Doc why dont you direct your Attention and Rant to the Battlefields Commission Andrea Jeaneau spinelessly backing down to a few Sovereigntists from having the Plains of Abraham Re-enacted on its Birthday.  If this keeps up, well never even know what our roots and history is.  There are some people that actually want to change or hide our History.  Its Happening and obviously working.  By the way, I think Harpo is doing a great job considering half of his Bills are being blocked.  Just my opinion.  At least you listen to some of the news. Not all CBC I hope."
