389138,Billy Bob,2009-10-01 22:50:00,5865,Here in NYS gun season in the southern tire doesn't start until Nov 21st........but duck season starts Oct 24th and pheasant starts Oct 17th....  Last Saturday we all met up at deer camp and cut some of the fields plus trimmed around our tree stands.  I decided this year I am getting a bit old to climb into my tree stand and so I built a ladder out of 2 - 2X4X12'. Now it's a bit heavy.....so I will be struggling to get it there (any volunteers to help..:<)  The best thing about opening day in deer camp is we get to see all those who we haven't seen since last year.....my son and nephew come in from out of town and it don't get no better than that.  Over the last two years we did lose two older comrades and they will be dearly missed.  Bob

Not sure what you guys are allowed in Ontario but in Indiana we can only harvest one buck. However in my county you can take about 11 does between bow, shotgun and muzzleloader. Can't wait to get back out there this weekend."

389249,richyb,2009-10-02 03:16:00,774,seen a doe and a fawn tonight . Had the doe at about 30 yards but im waiting on big poppa !
389270,trout-eater,2009-10-02 10:57:00,21,"  what you never killed something??   man your post make me laugh!!!!  yours specifically!!   and like others have stated, it's called selective harvesting!!!"
389283,Fish Farmer,2009-10-02 12:30:00,2234," Better harvesting than getting killed on the HWY and going to the dump. Plus saves our lives and crashes on our HWY's What about fish catch and keep, very tasty, same with Deer. Good luck out their boy's and gal's, BE SAFE The other Fish Farmer"
389370,misfish,2009-10-02 16:16:00,29133,"  Remember that young,n I got a pic of at the field stand,well she made a visit this morning 7:32 to be percise.Just as close as the pic.I had to pass aswell. Cant believe I passed up.Only day two of many.Lots of time. At 9am headed to the climber for a couple hours.Nada.  Lets hope the rain holds for abit saturday am.  Good luck to you aswell,the other Fishfarmer."
389382,NAW,2009-10-02 16:27:00,4022,"I have deer questions, but didn't want to start a new NF post to ask it.  I figured i'd add it here.  Here's my Q: Do deer eat soya beans before the beens have been cut?  Or do they wait to munch on that stuff untill after it's be cut down??  I have three properties that I hunt in Simcoe for deer, and they all have Soya beans in them.  2 of the properties have a fraction of the sign they had last year when corn was planted.  I'm wondering if the deer sign will pick up after the Soya bean harvest??  Sunday will be my first day in the stand.  AM and PM -- A marathon of sorts.  Thanks gents."
389383,misfish,2009-10-02 16:29:00,29133,"Yes they do.The land owner where I hunt, has seen them grazing out there.Problem is,theres no place for a stand there.Well I could put a tripod stand,I already got to many ares to cover already.LOL  GL."
