389224,Joey,2009-10-02 02:37:00,9122,"Well I've enjoyed the old photo's other's have posted on here, so after picking out some of the old ones I'm going to take to my dad's funeral, I thought I'd post a few here.  Here's a couple that I thought were pretty cool.  Dad with a bass and an old boat.  It says 1959 (before my time   )    Another 1959 one, dad on the dock with a beer    Must have been the same roll of film, Aug 1959.    This was later than 59, probably when I was about 3 maybe, so probably 1967, by the rapids in Minden (Daddy's little girl).    Hope you enjoy them.  Joey"
