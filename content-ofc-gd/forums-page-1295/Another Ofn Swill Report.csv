17536,Rich,2006-12-31 05:54:00,3927,"Although the pics lead you to believe we were the life of the party.. we really weren't. I guess we were all too tired to be our hyper, attention hogging selves. I think most of the people there will be grateful they didnt see the Filthwich Boyz in their full bloom.  Did I mention that Sleded is BALD?!  "

Quite the dynamic duo yourself and fishergirl were. Groper ? I was wondering who's hand that was.  We had a nice chat. You seem to have a passion for fishing that would rival anyone on this board and you're a classy lady as well. It was funny to see the expression on your face when people asked if you like to fish.  Thanks for keeping an eye on those young bucks too.  Your posts are great, so keep them coming."
17281,Joey,2006-12-30 17:00:00,9122,"Great pictures Nautifish.  It was great to meet some other ""fishergals"" and shoot the bull for awhile.  I think everyone had a great time, myself included (some more than others   )  I have a few pics I'll post in a bit.  Great seeing everyone again and meeting a few I hadn't yet.  Cheers.  Joey"

I haven't made it to one yet, thought I was going yesterday but have been feeling run down and didn't think a late night with beer & wings would do me any good...      Mike"
17334,Aaron Shirley,2006-12-30 20:08:00,655,It was great to see some of you again and meet some new faces as well.
