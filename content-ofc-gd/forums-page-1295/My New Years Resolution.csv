17980,bigfish1965,2007-01-01 05:22:00,3382,"This year is going to be different. Somehow I let the spring, summer and fall slide right by me. I hardly fished at all. I worked...alot...too much. I took on too much and too many things got half done or not done at all because of it. This year I will spend way more time on the things I love and the people I love. I will spend less time letting fools get under my skin. I will ignore and delete stupid emails. I will live more like my dog..rest when I'm tired, play when I'm not and enjoy a good roll in the grass (or hay) from time to time. I will spend more time being nice cause it is just as easy as being a goof. I will fish...lots. No one has ever been on their death bed and said they wished they spent more time at work. I will work to support living...not the other way around. I will listen to the music really loud, I will flirt with the not-so-pretty girls, I will occasionally get stupid drunk, I will occasionally eat too much and I will occasionally daydream about ridiculous fanatasy. Moreover, I will let the people around me know that I appreciate them and tell them they enrich my life and make waking up each day worth it. This year I will pay it forward."
