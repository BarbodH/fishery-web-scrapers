17492,Carp,2006-12-31 03:52:00,1488,"Once again the OFC decended upon the Town of Oakville to terrorize the patrons of The Firehall Sports Bar & Grill.  A great time was had by all in attendance.  Nice to see so many faces, new and old.  I finally met the BBR guys. What a motley crew. Quite the characters those boys.  Fishergirl, Aaron Shirley, nautifish, fishindevil and hearingfish were some of the people I was meeting for the first time. I know there were more, but the memory isn't what it used to be.  The Misty River family was there in full force. Super nice folks. Mistyriverjr was ready with pen in hand. I'll let him explain that one. Nice idea buddy.  Here are a few more pics to add to the mix already posted:  Big Bass Rich showing me how to perfect his famous hold.    Spiel letting me know life is good at OFC.   Fishfarmer talking technique with BPS Bassman   Tonyb giving me the ""life is good"" signal as well.   Fishingdevil has Joey's attention. Must be another fishing tale.   Tonyb and douG.   Aaron Shirley and loonietoon.     Spiel interupts his conversation with raf to pose for a shot.   Tracker and squid.   Sorry Roger. This one of you and Aaron turned out a bit fuzzy.   Mistyriverjr passing the pen to Joey while Mistyriver (dad), BPS Bassman and Spiel look on.   Nautifish being....well.....naughty. "

17497,DanTheMan,2006-12-31 04:02:00,257,Great stuff.  Wish I could of been there
17503,nautifish,2006-12-31 04:08:00,1416,LOL    Great pics carp and again great meeting you & the mrs.....Sorry but just could not resist......lol
17511,Joey,2006-12-31 04:21:00,9122,Great shots there Remo.  I sure had a good time.  What did Laura think of the motley crew?  Joey
17513,LesCulpJr,2006-12-31 04:30:00,75,"Holy smokes, which thread do I post to  Excellent pics by all. Looks like everyone had lots of fun with BBR and crew being the life of the party.  New site looks great btw. I don't stop by all that often but look forward to attending one of these functions one day.  cheers, Les......formerly largie69"
17525,Carp,2006-12-31 05:09:00,1488,I think the BBR crew had Laura wondering what she had walked in to Joey. She forgot all about them when she got chatting with some of the other fine folks sitting around us. Raf's girlfriend and Mistyriver 1's wife kept her mind off the antics going on nearby.  That pic you posted of the young lads sleeping on the way home is great nautifish.
17526,Joey,2006-12-31 05:15:00,9122,"Its funny Carp, in the picture with Aaron and Loonietoon, in the background, see the sign that says ""undefeated season"" for the Leafs.  Squid and I were talking and we figured that must have been the year of the lockout  Joey"
17532,Carp,2006-12-31 05:37:00,1488,"Exactly Joey. If you looked carefuly at the board, it said 2004/2005 season. Maybe next year."
17550,Roy,2006-12-31 11:49:00,13728,"Great stuff guys! I'm overwhelmed at the big names making an appearance this year too. Remo, in the  third pic, doesn't Don Henley look amazingly like Tybo?"
17558,Fish Farmer,2006-12-31 13:11:00,2234,"Nice meeting you Carp. We had a Great time meeting a lot of nice fisher people. Like Bob Izumi says ""OFC makes it a possibility""."
17570,mistyjr1,2006-12-31 13:33:00,97,I had a great time.  It was nice to meet some people again and some prople for the first time.  Some people had me laughing so hard with their stories.  Carp Ben said that your part of the dinner was better than ours   Hope to see everyone again one day
17574,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-31 13:44:00,0,"Remo, really enjoyed your company  Great pics."
17636,Rich Clemens,2006-12-31 16:33:00,3131,Why do I have to live so dang far away ?
17688,Carp,2006-12-31 17:42:00,1488," The first thing we noticed when he walked in was Don Henley's (Tybo's) new haircut Roy. I almost didn't recognize him. Thought maybe Joey brought her part timer to the bash.   Hey Rich, that's why we made it on a Friday night. Figured the people from farther away could come if they had the weekend attached to the swill. It was a bit more relaxed as most in attendance didn't have to work the next day. No worries about rushing home. We still didn't stay very late anyway. I wanted to relieve my parents of their babysitting duties. It's a 30 min. drive for me and I think we were home before midnight."
17691,joefish,2006-12-31 17:55:00,165,Someboddy's gotta tell BBR to stop making those God awful faces or they are gonna stick with him!!!   Whats that you say?? That is his face????
17699,Joey,2006-12-31 18:06:00,9122,"   Paul didn't know what Don Henley looked like.  Hmmmm, I suppose, but Don needs a goatee  Joey"
