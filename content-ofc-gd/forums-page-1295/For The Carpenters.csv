She was in cahoots with the journeyman I am training under...(he was a master wooden ship builder in England) anyways...  she asked him if I was in need of some tools etc... knowing he would tell her what I REALLY needed.. LOL  Here is what I recieved  http://www.leevalley.com/wood/page.aspx?c=...amp;cat=1,41504  Set of six... Man are these things nice!! I have a crapload of chisels and trust me they have been put through hell...but these are pretty!! and will never see a bradnail or headless (pin) nail... (She made me promise!) LOL...   golly I have a fantastic woman.  Gerritt."
17932,Greencoachdog,2007-01-01 03:59:00,8163,Oooooooooooooo! Looks like one of those would clean the concrete residue out of one of my patented concrete form outside corners lickity-split!... and go thru a 16d Duplex before a cat could lick his butt!
17938,tjsa,2007-01-01 04:09:00,1578,"Wrong kind of chisels for your application Glen, but they do look nice Gerritt."
17942,Greencoachdog,2007-01-01 04:17:00,8163,"  Whadya mean wrong kind? a chisel is a chisel!... can I borry the 24mm one Gerrit??? They look like a good quality tool to me and I don't think a 32 oz. waffle faced Estwing would hurt them a bit!... I'll return it in a month or 2, after I save up enough to buy myself a new one."
17943,tjsa,2007-01-01 04:19:00,1578,"Ya, OK, it would be worn down to the handle after you got done with it, lol."
17944,Gerritt,2007-01-01 04:24:00,6129,"LOL GCD to funny!!!... I have a crapload of Footprint Chisels you can beat on till your hearts content! Hell I'll send you a couple of 2""rs for fun just to lighten the load in my toolbags LOL  they are nice Chisels, well balanced and sharp outta the box...most chisels I have owned while they have an edge they need to be honed...   on average I hone my chisels 2-3 times a day (depending on usage and what we are involved in) my planes tend to received more abuse however and see the wetstone even more cant beat a good Veritas Plane... regardless of size Veritas has been the best plane I have laid my hands upon.  Happy New Years guys!  Gerritt."
17953,Greencoachdog,2007-01-01 04:43:00,8163,"They are beautiful tools Gerrit... too pretty, I'd be afraid to hit them with anything harder than a powder puff and cut anything harder than styrofoam with them."
