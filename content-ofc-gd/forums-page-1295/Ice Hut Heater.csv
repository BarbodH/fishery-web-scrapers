17565,Dondorfish,2006-12-31 13:22:00,1000,I had the black cat heater - took it back and got the Mr. Heater - more BTU'S . Much happier with the Mr. Heater Buddy.   Don

17720,joonmoon,2006-12-31 18:35:00,528,I've heard the Mr. heater is way better. I have the Black cat and even on the really cold days and eves it is suffient enough to take the chill out. But then again My blood is like tar and I think I'm part eskimo or something....maybe its just that I AM CANADIAN.
