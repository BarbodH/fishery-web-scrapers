17210,lew,2006-12-30 14:14:00,12767,"Mornin boyz, I'll be buying a Navionics chip for my new, and 1st, GPS unit in the next little while and have a couple questions for you.  I understand from friends that the gold chip will serve my purposes  quite nicely, but then someone mentioned a gold plus.......Is there a difference between the gold & gold plus ??  Does the gold cover Quinte ??  I know there's a Platinum coming out and does anyone have any idea how much it'll cost, and will it be worth the extra $$$$ to get it over the gold ??"
17213,fishdawg,2006-12-30 14:18:00,912,morning Lew - Jamie has the gold chip & it worked great for us on Quinte be aware though I dont know if Navionics has added the French/Nippissing area yet - i know you fish there a little bit - would be handy to help navigate along the shoals & whatnot -
17216,lew,2006-12-30 14:23:00,12767,"Thanks Mark, that's what I wanted  to hear about Quinte and yes, I'm aware that it doesn't cover Nippissing."
17223,Eddyk,2006-12-30 15:05:00,195,Oh great! More gagets in your boat for the May 24 weekend. Pretty soon I wont have a place to sit.
17270,superdad,2006-12-30 16:30:00,353,"Lew,  The Gold chip will do a good job for Quinte, I hope to get one this spring, Have to investigate the Platinum card too.  Will show all the bumps around your little island  Happy New Year  David  aka  Superdad"
17308,lew,2006-12-30 18:02:00,12767,"I stopped into JB's this morning and was told the Gold Plus chip is only for the color units and I'll need the Classic chip for the monochrome X-17  Strange thing though, he said the Classic is the same price as the Gold.....$275......it would seem to me the chip with less detail should be worth less money    You remember that little island, do you David ??.....it still holds plenty of springtime pickeral even after all these years"
17309,setomonkey,2006-12-30 18:05:00,872,"   Hmmm, time for a bigger boat?  I don't have a GPS but would like to get one, it would be very handy in unfamiliar waters, and esp. to mark spots.  Looking for landmarks and watching the sonar can work but not always...  Mike"
17336,fishindevil,2006-12-30 20:16:00,6254,"if you go to the navionics website you can see the different chips and the areas that they cover,the platinum chip for navionics is number  901xl,it cover alot of ontario,from about sudbury down,the other chip#900xl does the rest as well as 3 great lakes the 901 covers lakes o,erie,georgian bay and some of huron,go check them out"
17353,Roy,2006-12-30 22:24:00,13728,"I have the 902 XL3 chip. It covers from the Maritimes to Kingston. I will get the 901 chip as soon as I have the chance. It doesn't seem like a lot for the money, eh?  "
17489,Blake,2006-12-31 03:49:00,418,I run the 17M and the LMS 480M as aswell.  They run on the Navionics Gold XL3 chip not the Classic. For Quinte and all the Trent with the 901G Eastern Great Lakes.  Give Fishing World a call in Hamilton that's where a few of the board memebrs and myself have picked them up. You can also wait for the shows in Toronto and pick one up there as you can talk to the reps right there.
17493,glen,2006-12-31 03:55:00,2641,When is the chip coming out that shows the fish on it too.
17545,lew,2006-12-31 10:27:00,12767,"Thanks guys, that's what I needed to know, and Blake, I'll talk to the reps when I get to the show.  Roy, your right about that, you don't get much for your $$$$ anymore"
17592,muskymatt,2006-12-31 14:43:00,2608,"Lew I've got the East great lakes gold  and it all you need , very impressed  Matt"
17594,lew,2006-12-31 14:50:00,12767,"Thanks Matt, are using the gold in the X-17 ??"
17628,muskymatt,2006-12-31 16:21:00,2608,"No I'm running the 480m ,but may move that up front and upgrade the main gps. I've also used it on other friends  boats on different units and have never has any issues with it."
