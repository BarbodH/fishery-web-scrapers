Be they of yourself maybe one of the kids or a freind, & if you do to see if you would kindley share them with the rest of  us ofnr's.....lol..  This pic was taken a couple of yrs ago i had been out fishing all afternoon brought this sweetie home and my youngest wanted his picture taken with it so i could send it to family back over in Europe.  So i said sure but when it came to him actually holding the fish.....Well if you check out his hands you will see what i mean.  I still get a laugh from this picture......He thinks fish are smelly & slimey........     & here this is a picture i took of BBR earlier in the fall when i took him out fishing with me for the day to a secret spot of mine,,,,,Now doesn't he actually look kinda like a cute innocent kid in this picture?.....lol  "
