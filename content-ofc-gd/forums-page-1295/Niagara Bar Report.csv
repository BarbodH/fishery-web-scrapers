17360,Sherriff,2006-12-30 22:51:00,252,"Headed out over the last few days with some friends to the Niagara Bar for Lakers.  Was a tough go with the poor weather and the river was in rough shape. Tried out by the bar but was getting too rough.  Headed in to the river for some drifts.  I landed a bow after many, many drifts and re ties.....   Next up Joe landed a nice brown..Looks like a bow in these pics though, maybe it was a bow....   Close to calling it a day I landed my first Laker!   Was truly surprising how strong these fish are and how they can stay on the bottom.  I thought I had an anchor on at first....  Was a great time out there with great folks.  Just wish the results had been better...  Sherriff"
