Might not be too sensitive for some species, but would work."

17918,pameladallaire,2007-01-01 03:31:00,470,"I love the fly rod!  Gonna make me one.  But we use the handle ends for ice fishing.  I just attached a piece of graphite on the tip of a broken rod when a pencil wasn't long enough in my hubby's workshop.  Cottage back scratcher.  Cat fishing (feline variety) add catnip toy to end and have fun.  House plant stake, for the tall varieties.  Add a dust mop and you have a spider web duster for those hard to reach places.  "
