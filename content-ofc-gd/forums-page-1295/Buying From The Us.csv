18058,Sherriff,2007-01-01 14:30:00,252,I cannot seem to find any posts on buying a boat from the US.  I know i have seen some in the past. Anyone have any experience with this or links to the posts.  Thanks  Sherriff

Before i bought my rig i looked into this option and i concluded that it was not worth it to for me to buy in the USA the main reason being the warranty if you need warranty work done the Canadian dealers will not honor the warranty, now if you are thinking of buying a used rig where no warranty is offered thats a different story."
