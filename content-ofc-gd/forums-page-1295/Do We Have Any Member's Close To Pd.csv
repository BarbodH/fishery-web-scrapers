17464,fishinfool,2006-12-31 02:48:00,366,"Too bad it isn't last week. I worked the whole week in Simcoe at the Zehrs expansion (gas piping) and I even brought my rods with me. I was planning on getting out somewhere to do a little fishing but I never did make it out. Oh well, I may be back in the New Year to finish up so maybe we can get out then. Good Luck tomorrow.  Stan"

17469,fishinfool,2006-12-31 03:19:00,366,"Nautifish Actually, I live in Pickering and last week was the first time I ever came out to Simcoe. I looked up the area on Google Maps first and saw how close to PD I was going to be, hence the rods. Anyway, I will let you know if I am coming back in the New Year ok. I may be bringing ice rods at that time though.  Stan"
