17414,Guest mistyriver1,2006-12-31 00:37:00,0,"Well my third Christmas swill, and another good time was had.  The night always seems to go by so fast and would have liked to talk to more folks......  A few more signatures for the monopoly board , but I'm gonna let mistyjr post that.   Sat with Carp and his wife Laura....(Good to see you again Remo)   Had a nice long chat with TEP.   Some various shots from the night...  fishindevil and Roger (BPSBassman).  Fishindevil, I would have liked to chat with you but you were a busy guy.  Roger always great to see you and thanks so much for that stuff   Tonyb and BITEME (Peter).   Tony thanks again for organizing the night.   Tony again and Doug..   Had a nice visit with Rick....   Another reason we were all there.......    Spiel, Squid and Tracker (I think ??, we never got a chance to meet Tracker)   Ron and Rattletrap.  Ron, it was great to talk with you.  Rattletrap, again not enough time on the night.    Me having a chat with Aaron Shirley.  Thanks for coming and chatting with my boys, Aaron.   Ben (my younger son) taking a ride......   Raf, Tybo and BPSbassman   Joey and fishindevil...   This was my cue it was time to go home. "
17416,Joey,2006-12-31 00:44:00,9122,"Great pictures Misty1.  I sure wish we had more time to talk too.  Seems we just got there and then is was almost midnight    Maybe we'll just have to have a few more of these get togethers, maybe a little closer to home too.  Thanks for the recap of the night.  Joey"
17478,Dondorfish,2006-12-31 03:35:00,1000,Nope - thats not me in that picture - but I was there. I was sitting with Fishfarmer as you guy's were leaving _ was talking to your young fella Next swill I'll be sure to introduce myself   Don
17479,bpsbassman,2006-12-31 03:39:00,941,Sorry I didn't get more of a chance to  talk to you Don. Next time.
17480,nautifish,2006-12-31 03:40:00,1416,Great pics misty and yes the night just flew by. We actually got there early and i could not beleive how quick 10.30 pm came......
17481,Whopper,2006-12-31 03:41:00,2174,"Looks like a great time! Beer, wings and good company, don't get no better than that!  Thanks  Whopper"
17483,Dondorfish,2006-12-31 03:42:00,1000,Anytime Roger - always enjoy talking fishing / boating with you.   Don
17490,wuchikubo,2006-12-31 03:52:00,1114,"Great pics Mistyriver, it was nice to get out to my first swill with the OFNers.  I didn't get much chance to speak with many beyond just the introduction.  What a great bunch that showed up. I'll have to take pics next time too.  It was nice meeting all of you before I had to leave around 9:30 with my son Joseph (who had to get to bed)"
17516,bigfish1965,2006-12-31 04:39:00,3382,"Man I hate work. I had to arrive late and leave early. Then I found my camera batteries were dead. Anyway.....for the short while I was there it was really good to see everyone. I don't get to see you guys often enough, so it was a great treat for me. I was pretty beat from work cause we've just been getting crushed by crowds so I wasn't all that talkative (WOW!). Thanks again for putting it together Tony and thanks for the beer Spiel. It reminded me of why we put so much time into this."
17520,Carp,2006-12-31 04:51:00,1488,"It was nice seeing and talking to you again Jim. Your family was great company at our table. I hope Mistyriverjr keeps up those OFC projects. He has talent, patience and a passion for fishing.  I guess Ben finally had enough of talking to an old guy like me. I put him to sleep."
17640,setomonkey,2006-12-31 16:36:00,872," Rick, was wondering why you were in a suit at the swill!    Regret that I wasn't able to attend as planned, would have been great to meet you and the other OFNCers after all this time...  Mike"
