18010,Photoz,2007-01-01 10:01:00,792,"I'd almost for got what a decent trout on the receiving end of my line felt like . . . .       the last 4 times out . . .     about 4 'line bumps,' didn't even see many hits! Yesterday I was FINALLY rewarded when I took my eyes off my rod for about 5 seconds . . .     and looked back to see it wildly bouncing, and a nice 8 pound trout doing a back-flip about 200' out. In my haste to get to the rod, I slipped in some loose gravel, and NEARLY ended up going for a swim! My dear ol' Auntie knows how to stuff & roast these guys better than any turkey . . .      I can hardly wait for dinner today! But . . . .      I don't keep many (hell, I don't CATCH many) but on those good days I don't know which is worse . . . .     seeing people taking 5 large trout home . . . .     or those who catch 10 or more, hold the big ones up by the gills for shots, then uncerimoniously KICK it along several feet frozen ground, across gravel & concrete & into the water, after it's flopped around for several minutes? I likely 'kill' less in a year than SOME (definately NOT all) of these proud 'conservationists' do in an outing!! Oh well . . . . .    what can ya do?  "

18032,Canuck2fan,2007-01-01 13:36:00,1444, I have rarely seen truer words written here!!!! Talk about hitting the nail right on the head. Congrats on a beautiful fish and I hope you enjoy every tasty morsel.
18062,Pigeontroller,2007-01-01 14:48:00,2793,No need to explain. Nothing wrong with eatin' some of your catch now and again.
18063,danc,2007-01-01 14:48:00,4677,"Congrats Steve. Happy New year, and enjoy the feast!!"
18069,Smokey,2007-01-01 15:06:00,1278,Congrats and enjoy. Thanks for the report.

18094,fishindevil,2007-01-01 17:07:00,6254,nice report & nice lookin trout
18097,fishdawg,2007-01-01 17:21:00,912,nothing wrong with a feed or two at all - enjoy!
18108,Photoz,2007-01-01 17:59:00,792,"Not exactly apologizing . . . . .     but geeze . . . .    with the flack we 'fish-killers' sometimes take these days, it makes you feel kinda guilty sneakin' the odd ONE home. P3TA lurks EVERYWHERE!! Port Hope was a virtual tomb today . . .    apparently the days of 'limiting out' on trout here are gone . . . .     I talked to a local this morning, he bets there were less than 10 trout caught in town all weekend . . . .      I know I never even saw a hit in 5 hours this morning . . . . .     between the 10 or 12 people fishin'! Waitin' with much anticipation for the new regs . . . .      hopin' they drop the trout limits out east like up Georgian Bay way . . . .     it seems to have worked okay up there?"
18111,jordan,2007-01-01 18:28:00,136,Nice trout its always fun to have one on the end of your line.    jordan
18116,TroutSlayer,2007-01-01 19:01:00,64," Very nice catch Photoz!  I like to eat fish also, and don't worry about how they're held when they are destined for the oven!  This one was a nice meal!  "
18162,wishn4fishn,2007-01-01 22:40:00,108,"Nice stuff, they always hit when u least expect it.  Congrats on a fine catch."
18194,TroutSlayer,2007-01-02 00:10:00,64," I expect a hit on every drift!  Doesn't always happen though!  Photoz, can you share Aunties recipe?"
18199,cisco,2007-01-02 00:26:00,597,"Great news Steve!   Hey, maybe share the recipe if your Aunt permits. I may be trying some river spots soon and who knows, maybe I'll catch a rainbow!!!!"
18207,Carp,2007-01-02 00:54:00,1488,That a sweet looking trout Photoz.  I'm sure it will be even sweeter when your auntie fixes it up with her special recipe.  Congrats and enjoy.
