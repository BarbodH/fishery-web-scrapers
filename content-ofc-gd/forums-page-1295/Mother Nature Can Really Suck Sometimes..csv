17840,nautifish,2006-12-31 23:52:00,1416,Well i headed out this morning with the tinny in tow......Got to the bay and it was just way to windy and choppy for my little boat. Man i was a little niffed because i was they're yesterday also and the water was like glass.....Sods law that is i swear....No boat and could not have asked for better conditions.....So anyway decided to fish off the peir for an hour and not so much as nibble......Tyred my one rod n reel with my pickeral rig. Then switched over to my other rod with my baitcastor reel and tryed some lures and still nothing.  So about an hr has passed i can no longer feel my fingers & that was wearing gloves....lol...So toodled off back home unhitched the tinny and headed out to some local spots not too far away. Again nothing. That wind was just bitter today. So if the weather is fair tommorow i will be out to give it another shot.....No polar dipping for me......Sorry but fishing comes 1st.  Anyone else ever get these days where u seem to go out and fish fish fish and nothing not a bloody thing?..........Well a pumpkin seed yesterday but hardley anything to brag about...sheeshhh!!!....lol   This was the inner bay yesterday.     and a favorite spot of mine very close to my home.

17854,nautifish,2007-01-01 00:10:00,1416,Ohhh and i did get a couple of pictures of these cuties today while i was out on my travels.

LOL....Now i never said i was gonna do it GD.  But if the weather is better tommorow i will for sure be out on the boat.
17861,Rich,2007-01-01 00:22:00,3927,"I guess you could say mother nature really ""blows""... ohhh terrible joke alert!  I'll be out tomorrow as well nauti.. but it is supposed to be even windier."
17866,nautifish,2007-01-01 00:26:00,1416,Well i will keep an eye on the weather....if the bay is too choppy i may head over to the ponds with the tinny.  I don't care i just know if i do not catch a half decent size fish soon i am gonna scream......lol
17898,Canuck2fan,2007-01-01 02:10:00,1444,"Decided to go fishing today since the weather is looking damp tomorrow. I thought I would give a buddy of mine ""another"" chance to get his first rainbow ever. (He's only been skunked now about 40 times in a row....) Anyhow a few of us got out to a local trib and started fishing about 6AM. NOTHING not even a line tap. About 9AM another angler shows up he had been fishing closer to the lake and was not able to handle the high winds. Anyhow 1hr later he has landed 2 fish, while our party got skunked....  I hope everyone's luck turns around in 07 LOL"
17903,tjsa,2007-01-01 03:07:00,1578,"Too bad about the weatherman screwing up your plans Amo, but, there's always next time."
17920,Greencoachdog,2007-01-01 03:34:00,8163,I plan to get out tomorrow even though they're forecasting 10-20 mph winds (that's 16-33 Canadian kph). Gonna find a half way sheltered spot and just drown some shiners... whether I catch anything or not.
17939,fishindevil,2007-01-01 04:11:00,6254,"well nauti,remember never give up,just cause you were skunked a few times thats part of fishing ,and its only because of the weather so things will turn around soon they always do,hope to see a few fish pics from you soon,take care tracy chat soon        cheers"
