16904,lew,2006-12-29 10:11:00,12767,"I've been going to the Spring Show since day 1 Steve and always enjoyed it, but last year was a real disappointment with what seemed like 1/2 the vendors not there anymore. I'll go again this year if they have one, but if it hasn't improved over last year, it'll be my last time.  The Sportsman Show has gone waaaaaaay downhill the last few years too, so maybe they should scrap them both, and come up with one big decent show at a decent price and maybe they'll get the interest back from the public"
16907,Guest skeeter99,2006-12-29 11:12:00,0,yep it is still on  here is the site  http://www.springfishingshow.com/site/  I already bought my ticket  troy
16976,setomonkey,2006-12-29 14:57:00,872,"Photoz, yeah it's on, I was at LeB to pick up a few things on Boxing Day and they had coupons to save $1 off the admission.  Mike"
16983,TJQ,2006-12-29 15:27:00,7806,"Yup...  its still on...  WE will be doing our annual giving away of a bunch of tickets.. as usuall..  Ill wont have a booth this year, but I will be going down for the show all day saturday... thats the plan anyway!!"
16988,Bob Devine,2006-12-29 15:38:00,251,"With the rising costs of expenses it is tough for exhibitors to come to the shows. Floor space is BIG $$ and the cost of employees, food travel and lodging many cannot afford the show. As for consumers, we are looking for the biggest bang for our buck and will wait sometimes before we purchase. Looking forward to the shows. Not only have the TO shows suffered but also the ones across Michigan that I have attended."

Guess it's their way of showing that they support it...while they have their own little ""show"" the same dates at the store! LOL  Feb 15, 16, 17 and 18th Steve!"
17100,setomonkey,2006-12-29 22:08:00,872,"TJ, not worth your while to have a booth this year?  Too bad, sounds like a trend over the past few years for these shows. I haven't been in a few years now...  Mike"

I am looking forward to the Spring Show, hubby said it was the lowest he had ever seen.....Is there another possible place to put it, that would be alot lower price to set up booths..... Oh why not come out with a sticker we can wear, to identify each other at the show......  Lorissa"
