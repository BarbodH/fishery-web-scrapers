17410,Whopper,2006-12-31 00:11:00,2174,"Well after a couple of skunk trips this week I finally managed to catch a few saugeyes, Went for about an hour after work yesterday and caught two.   Hit it real good this morning, probably caught twenty of the little buggers.      All fish came on jig/wtwister on a current break in 15' of water. All small fish but what the hey I had a blast, not bad for December 30. Going to have to scout a few more spots to find the bigger ones or wait for some colder weather because they will come  Whopper"

17674,Smokey,2006-12-31 17:27:00,1278,Nice fish Phil. Fishing so far up this way has been a bit tough with all the warm weather so far. Nice to see some eyes being caught.

17804,Whopper,2006-12-31 22:57:00,2174,"Thanks everyone! Couldn't stand it had to go back again today   , ending the year with a three fish outing and what a year it has been!  I really hate for it to end.   I hope everyone here at OFC has a Happy New Year! The Mrs and I are going out to celebrate!  Best Fishes for 2007"
