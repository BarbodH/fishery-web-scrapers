We got a light bit of snow yesterday morning in Toronto, but it's warming up +6 today and supposed to remain there all week along with some rain. As for ice I think North of North Bay everything is freezing up well but no signs of it happening on Simcoe a for awhile yet.  Hope your enjoying the nice weather down there.  Mike"
