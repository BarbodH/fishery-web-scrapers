Meadows End Resort (Sebright ON) 705-833-2666   dsn"

17694,Rattletrap2,2006-12-31 17:57:00,1652,"Nanook, Layzee Acres has not had cabins for a long , long time now. They do however rent the odd trailer out that is already set-up on a site. Even this though, is only on the rare occasion.  The launch ramp is excellent and they have 3 or 4 real nice boats that they rent out with 9.9 hp. Honda 4 stroke engines. Campsites are always available too.  Lake Dalrymple Resort is your best (and only) bet for a cabin. Hazel, Gayle, and Cal are good folks and run a nice operation. Their boat rentals are only 6 h.p. Suzuki engines though.  Meadows End Campground is good also, but I think they have pretty much eliminated all their old white cabins as well.  Good luck!"
