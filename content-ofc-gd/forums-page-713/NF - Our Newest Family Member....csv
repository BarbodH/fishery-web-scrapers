To this...in just 7.5 weeks   And now that the 3 we aren't keeping have left the ""nest"" and are gone to their new homes, we can devote all our time to our newest family member, Princess.  (Averie named her) Wait t'il i'm at the launch callin' her into the boat...Here Princess! lol ah well.    She's an awesome dog, and is learning the ropes real quick from Sheba.  Now I've got 3 fishing partners, and am looking forward to getting out in the boat!  Have a good week @ the office!  Cheers Ryan"

My daughter was just beside me when I was posting my reply and her first reaction was "" aaaah! y√© cute! "" I told her that you previously were looking for homes for them and she immediately said "" why didn't you get one.... "" LOL Jacques"
