444285,Cudz,2010-03-16 03:31:00,2652,I might wait on the Niagara river after several people have told me that the water clarity and conditions might not be good on Wednesday.  I will be staying at The White Oaks Conference Resort with my family on Thursday and Friday so Friday morning I might still hit up the river but maybe from shore.  That leaves me Wednesday to fish pretty much anywhere.   Is anything open on Lake O?  Bronte?  I really don't care where it is I just want to get out fishing on a boat.  thanks
