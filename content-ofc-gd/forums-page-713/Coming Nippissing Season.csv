Does this weather set up for a 1-2 weeks scenario ahead of typicall seasonal patterns or can one expect to arrive in Nippissing on June 1st and all the walleye are already in a summer pattern?  Local or lake regulars advice would be very much appreciated.  Typically when I get there on June 1st I still need my mittens at times but this year feels like an early summer.  If my question is hard to understand, sorry, can't seem to word it any better."
