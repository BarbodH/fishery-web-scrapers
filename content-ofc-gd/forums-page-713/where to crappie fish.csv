443635,tb4me,2010-03-14 04:48:00,3295,hey how do I use google earth hybird? I thought it was a pay service?
443637,Dozer,2010-03-14 06:38:00,896,Coors and Heinenken?
443753,jackal68,2010-03-14 18:34:00,68, Thank you very much! I looked on google earth and seen it. Again thank you Rob
443754,jackal68,2010-03-14 18:35:00,68,was that cought in the ponds in waterford?
443781,vinnimon,2010-03-14 20:03:00,2593,"Not at all tb4me, not at all, or I really lucked out.The hybrid is awesome.If I remember right, go to googles earth and down load the advance/hybrid version.And when your pc notifies you of google earth updates,I update.The street sceens are neat as well. Here is a glimpse "
443782,vinnimon,2010-03-14 20:06:00,2593,I beleive its the one I lost twice on the same retreive  last august.
444013,ch312,2010-03-15 15:09:00,1590," took that beauty on a 1/2"" piece of worm while targeting finicky bluegill.  for those who havent fished waterford ponds before. this is not a typical catch and id assume that its one of very few bass in those waters that is that big. dont go there with high expectations of catching big bass or you will be disappointed. kinda like the 12.25"" perch i caught out of puslinch...likely the only one in there that size.  '"
444014,jackal68,2010-03-15 15:48:00,68,"Im just trying to find a ""decent local hole"" to teach my kids. Panfish is the place to start. I was raised (half of my life) in western Quebec and I cut my teeth on 42 inch pike at the age of 12. Back to teaching my kids. I dont want a place where im snagging sheephead and carp! its just a turnoff. I literally want to ""upchuck"" when I get those fish on."
444033,brifishrgy,2010-03-15 16:25:00,559,  your kids wont mind catching sheephead or carp .. spent many days at wilkes dam in Brantford when my son was young catching creek chubs and suckers .. now when we troll the grand for eyes and he hooks into a sheephead the smile is still there when he lands it .. as long as there is something biting they will have fun
444047,packrat,2010-03-15 17:43:00,93,"  You're sitting on top of one of the best local fishing holes around to teach your kids.  For gawds sake DONT take them to Wilkes dam tho---good location but not for kids.  As for Waterford ponds the main pond in front of the pavilion used to have lots of smallish gills for them to play with and if you move toward the back there is a ""point"" that sticks out into the lake that used to have some dinky perch.   I say ""used to"" cuz I havent fished there for years so ?????"
444070,brifishrgy,2010-03-15 19:42:00,559,"  Haven't been there for quite a while (2005) .. what has changed to make it not good for kids???????   2002   2005  used to be tons of chubs, rockbass, smallmouth and suckers"
444084,packrat,2010-03-15 20:27:00,93,"""used to be tons of chubs, rockbass, smallmouth and suckers""  Still is, its just that MOST of the time its combat fishing at its worst and my personal opinion is its not the place to try to teach a youngster how to fish.  You obviously lucked out to have the pad to yourself."
444133,brifishrgy,2010-03-15 22:08:00,559, I believe I was on continental shifts then so it would have been during the week .. almost every time down there during the summer months we were the only ones there
444158,jackal68,2010-03-15 23:25:00,68,"Pakrat is correct about ""combat fishing"" Some days you go there and you jump back in the car. They also changed the layout after teenage boy drowned crossing the damn. Plus u need to take three pounds of jigs due to all the snags.lol I used to live just down the street from wilkes"
444416,jackal68,2010-03-16 17:46:00,68,Went for a short road trip to waterford. Checked it out! Some guys were there already. They gave me the 411 on bass as well. I cant wait for the warmer weather
444417,CRAPPIE,2010-03-16 17:54:00,213,Are they ice fishing there in Waterford of shore fishing on open water? Thanks!
444420,bassman87,2010-03-16 18:08:00,586,why are people still mentioning ice fishing?
444432,ch312,2010-03-16 19:34:00,1590, because in many places there is still safe ice once you manage to get off shore without getting wet. ill take a drive out to waterford tomorrow to see whats going on.
444472,raptorfan,2010-03-16 21:40:00,126,I am hitting up waterford tonight for some crappie and panfish with the kids.....will post a report later
444489,jackal68,2010-03-16 22:49:00,68,open water at the culvert. No hits on the lines though
444539,raptorfan,2010-03-17 01:38:00,126,"Yup, as caribou said, I think the ice will be completely gone by thursday, barely an inch left where I was fishing, and the one pond was already clear.  No hits tonight, about 8 people fishing blueline bridge and no one was getting into anything.  Lots of swells though, and geese too"
442984,jackal68,2010-03-12 17:26:00,68,Hi guys I am new to this forum. I was wondering if anyone could tell me where to go crappie fishing (from shore) around the Brantford area please?
442998,Dondorfish,2010-03-12 18:17:00,1000,Try either side of the bridge that crosses the Holland River on #11. Few more weeks and the place will be packed with crappie hunters.   Don
443002,bow slayer,2010-03-12 18:26:00,1074,I think he meant Brantford not Bradford.
443005,Dondorfish,2010-03-12 18:29:00,1000,LOL - sorry guy's - time to clean the glasses!  Don
443117,vinnimon,2010-03-13 00:15:00,2593,"Waterford is the closest around branford,for all year round fishing.Crappie make there way up the grand come spring time.As for waterford, there are quite a few lakes/ponds to choose from.Binbrook is another as well as mountsberg resevoir."
443204,jackal68,2010-03-13 02:59:00,68,Where could I get more info on waterford? My bait store doesnt offer a lot of help
443238,dannyboy,2010-03-13 04:27:00,367,"If they can't help you use the bait they sold you find another bait store as they will be out of business shortly anyway.  Head south on 24 out of Brantford, turn east on Mechanic Road after about 1.5 k you will start to see the ponds, or carry on one road further to Thompson and turn left, fish in the fishy looking spots.   Dan"
443272,skinny,2010-03-13 11:53:00,442,I fished the ponds a ton last summer but mostly for bass there was always people there fishing for crapie i fished the ones off Mechanic  mostly
443274,vinnimon,2010-03-13 11:57:00,2593,Mechanic rd is your best option for crappie.
443281,tknohpy,2010-03-13 12:10:00,162,I have never fished Crappie before.  When do you start fishing for them?
443308,brifishrgy,2010-03-13 13:44:00,559,"Mohawk Lake in Brantford has some crappie in it ..there are a few spots off shore from Grenwich st or from Mohawk park ..  just look out for the shopping carts, broken bottles and used syringes .. oh and dont eat the fish"
443319,jackal68,2010-03-13 14:57:00,68,"Funny i took a ride out there yesterday. And your right dont eat the fish. Thanks Massey,And sunnoco"

443323,jackal68,2010-03-13 15:12:00,68,"Ok forgive me! I was looking at mapquest and I see the old 24 runs through town. I am assuming its the new 24 that you turn right on Mechanic st? Secondly these ponds are ""crown"" land?."
443471,jackal68,2010-03-13 20:39:00,68,bump please

443477,tknohpy,2010-03-13 21:15:00,162,I see what looks like ponds at 24 and Maple Ave?  Am I at the right place?  Can someone add GPS coordinates?

443485,vinnimon,2010-03-13 21:36:00,2593,"Now zoom in at the bridge on mechanics rd, between the 2 ponds.Thats where you will park your rod and butt for some crappie fishing.NOT CRAPPY FISHING  But for some crappy  ,pike and bass as well. I hope that helps."
