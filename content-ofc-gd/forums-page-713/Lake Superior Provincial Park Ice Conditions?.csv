444236,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2010-03-16 01:56:00,0,"i was up north sunday.  ice was better between island lake, northland and ranger vs. the park.  sunday in the park we had about 8 inches of poor ice with  a lot of holes."
444239,Dara,2010-03-16 02:00:00,3052,That sure went fast. I guess thats what 15 degrees and sunshine do.
444248,archie_james_c,2010-03-16 02:14:00,618,My uncle says they still have 16+ inches of solid ice on Ranger...maybe go for one last hurrah out there?
444265,anders,2010-03-16 02:31:00,1168,i was in the park on Saturday...fished 3 lakes all had 16-20 inches of solid black ice...some ice pulling from the shore already...i would advise against it for the weekend though

444565,pikeie,2010-03-17 02:50:00,380,Im probably going to give the rapids a go tomarrow afternoon! cant wait to get my first big steelie of the year!
444628,anders,2010-03-17 12:59:00,1168,"hey  with the change of temps back to seasonal...its -8 to-10 at night and it looks like thats the norm for the next week or so, so saying that...i retract my original statement.  I did put the ice fishing gear away, but i am bringing it back out tonight...guys were out yesterday and were saying the minimum ice they found was 12 inches."
