I must say that while working at it and watching the Paralympic opener and then onto the mens sledge hockey game.... I was pretty happy about what I was doing to this project.  First Rick Hensen got a terrific tribute to his solo accomplishment and then they honored our Canadian hero Terry Fox which I could not help myself into feeling a little wet around the eye balls during his tribute  Brought back great memories and remembered the publicity that his solo marathon attempt across Canada had done for cancer research and I was real glad that they had not forgotten about him  Now..... here's what I ended up doing.  Wanted to display their accomplishments and only way to do this was the medal count.  You can see that 14 7 5 and 26 is displayed    Another closer look for the ""GO CANADA GO""    A shot from a little further away to see the full piece    and another    Hope that our paralympic athletes do well in their game    GO CANDA GO Enjoy!!!
