443689,kickingfrog,2010-03-14 14:31:00,8333,Eight thirty Newfoundland!  Neat video. That man has enough fishing memories for all of our lifetimes.
443690,Muskieman,2010-03-14 14:34:00,2472,Gord Pyzer and Mike Plume Rock!!!   Great editing !!!   Love It! 8:30 Newfoundland !!   Randy Canuck
443692,MJL,2010-03-14 14:40:00,2427,"Thanks for posting this Ben...An amazing vid. Love the fish porn  Gord Pyzer is probably one of the most knowledgeable anglers I can think of.  He's one of the anglers I looked up to growing up as a kid (still do), watching him on Real Fishing Show and reading every article I could get my hands on which he authored.  A great, down to earth guy with a passion for fishing...How can anyone not like him?  Also in that vid is Doug Stange from In-Fisherman I believe...Another pivotal angler in my own fishing career."
