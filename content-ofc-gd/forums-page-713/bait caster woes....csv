444007,OhioFisherman,2010-03-15 14:57:00,6623,"I learned on a bait caster, and old Langley when I was 5, it takes some practice, and every reel can fell a bit different but it is something you should learn and get comfortable with if you like to fish. Spinning reels and even spin-casting reels can have their uses, but for big fish and frequent use a bait caster is the way to go. It doesn`t have to be a top end reel to get good results with it, just practice and getting used to the reel.  I clean my own, I like to know how much grease and oil is in them, it can make a bit of a difference in cooler weather when the grease and oil are thicker. Learn to flip and pitch with them, precise control will allow you to catch more fish.  I don`t like to experiment with line, find one that works for you and stick with it if it works. I have a mix of baitcaster, some from the late 70`s and early 80`s, all Abu`s or Shimano`s some newer one, just haven`t seen a reason to upgrade.  LOL practice! nothing worse than being in a boat with a partner that spends the day catching trees and docks."

444036,charlesn,2010-03-15 16:31:00,551,"What's a backlash?    Been using a baitcaster for 15 years or so now and still get an occasional nasty one where I just reel over it and act like I was done with that rod anyways if my non-boater is watching...  lol  Use heavy line.  I'd say 17-20 and use at least a 3/8 oz casting plug - 1/2 oz if you are going in to the wind at all.  The thicker diameter makes it far less likely that the line will really dig in to itself on the spool which can make for some interesting bird's nests...  Heck I think I could raised a few Great Blue Heron families on some of the ones I've had.  Set the brakes and centrifugal weights (if it is a centrifugal weight system) to max.  Learn to cast 20 feet without backlashing before worrying about casting 30/40/50/100 feet.  I'd also recommend practicing away from the lake first - because when I was learning I found that when you get a backlash on the lake - your immediate reaction is to put it down and resort to the spinning gear just to be fishing again.  After all, fishing time is precious.  But once you ""master"" it, I think you will tend to pick it up over the spinning reel more and more as there is just something about it - maybe it just feels like more of a direct connection to the lure or something but given the choice for a technique, I'll always pick baitcasting first.

Looked like 'KungFu' out there 'becoming one' with reel and rod....removed tape for one last cast in anticipation of spooling on heavier line as suggested, plug and line drift through the air in a beautiful arc and entranced, forget to use thumb....as mentioned in thread....kept me from getting smug! Thanks again."
444304,SlowPoke,2010-03-16 09:28:00,2984," Something to keep in mind is controling inertia. Spool braking and/or thumbing provides this. Without brakes or thumbing, your lure is trying to slow down before the spool.  When the spit hits the fan, it's because the spool's inertia trying to push the line through the guides instead of the lure pulling the line through the guides.  Light mono and all braids are limp and clingy and will bunch up on the spool or in the guides. A heavy (stiff) mono line is a lot more forgiving but not foolproof.  Understanding this concept and keeping the spool under control at all times will really help. Eventually you will be able to freespool in the middle of the cast thumbing when necessary as you feel a little line slap against your thumb. I tend to thumb the side of the spool rather than the line itself and find it reduces overthumbing and increases my distance."

With today`s super lines and floro there isn`t much need to run a lite line on a baitcaster."

444335,carp-starter,2010-03-16 12:42:00,253,"   Attached is a photo of a bait caster reel. This is my reel – ABU Garcia Pro Max 3600.  On the reel there are 2 drag systems – B and C (star drag). The two drags are independent of each other and they have different functions.  Drag C is the same as you would find on a spinning reel on top of the spool. If you tighten C, you will make it more difficult for the fish to pull out more line if he decides to run. If this drag is too loose, the fish will easily run and you will not be able to stop the fish and tire him.  Drag B controls the revolution of the spool on a cast. If it is too tight, you will not be able to cast the lure because the spool will not revolve. If it is too loose you will be able to cast the lure but you may get “bird’s nest” - if you do not stop the spool with your thumb. Bird’s nest will happen when the spool keeps on revolving when the lure hits the water or when the lure is coming out of the reel while the spool is revolving too fast. Basically, in both cases, the spool is revolving too fast.  To prevent “bird’s nest” you will have to tighten/loosen drag B and at the same time be able to cast your lure.  To cast a lure, you must first press knob A. Then you must adjust drag B.  Set up your rod, reel and lure so that the whole thing is ready to cast – hold the rod in front of you. Indoors or outside, it does not matter.  Press A and check what happens to your lure. Does it go down? If it goes down, tighten drag B all the way – this will become the starting point for you with instructions below. If the lure did not go down, continue with the instructions below.  Loosen drag B and loosen it to the point that the lure “just” goes down. Do not loosen B more than needed – just enough for the lure go down. Now we will FINE TUNE the setting.  Make sure that A has been pressed with your thumb. This will be the starting point to fine-tuning the drag - by casting a lure.  The above setting of B may be just right for the lure you are using. B must be changed and adjusted for every lure. But you may have to tighten B a touch or loosen B a touch. You will find this out when you cast the lure - OUTSIDE.  Cast first with the B drag as is. If you do not like it, you will have to cast with the B drag loosened or tightened and see what you like best. Make sure that the spool does not keep on revolving when the lure hits the water. When the spool keeps on revolving, you must tighten drag B or with your thumb stop the spool.  With my settings, once that lure hits the water, the spool on the reel STOPS revolving. It stops DEAD. I might be able to get a few yards more in my cast if I were to loosen B just a bit or more than just a bit. But then of course my spool would continue to revolve when my lure hits the water. To stop the spool, I would have to apply my thumb to the spool to stop it. The extra yards gained, if any, is not worth the hassle.  It is easier to cast a heavier lure than a lighter lure. With my Berkley Series One rod and the ABU Garcia Pro Max 3600 reel, ¾ to 1 oz is the perfect weight. For anything less than ½ oz I use a spinning rod.  Practice with a floating lure.  After I bought my rod/reel, I went over to a park on Lake Ontario to practice using a tandem Musky Killer, one ounce. On my first cast I got bird’s nest. While I tried to untangle the line, the lure sank to the bottom. When I untangled the line so that I could reel in the line, I found that the lure was stuck in the rocks. The result was that I lost a $10.00 (plus taxes of course) lure on my very first cast. So, use a floating lure. The heavier – around ¾ oz, the better.  I use 12 or 14 lbs Berkley, Trilene and I am happy.  After that very 1st cast, I never had bird’s nest again – 16 years ago.  Good luck.  carp-starter"

444374,Harrison,2010-03-16 15:04:00,2202," hahah ""Professional Override"" and for me, it always shows it's face when a camera boat appears or the perfect cast is linded up!  I know personally there is usually one rod/reel in the rod locker after each tournament with a ""professional override"" that isn't worth even trying to get out til after weigh-in.  Truth to why T anlgers have so many rods on deck!  Tons of great tips here!  I used the tip Terry mentioned 20 years ago when got my first low profile baitcaster.  One other little tidbit... like a golf or baseball swing - don't try and kill it!  Fliud motion is key.  Don't give up, it all comes with practice.  Soon you'll be able to side cast and skip under trees and docks with a baitcaster."
444547,Weeds,2010-03-17 02:04:00,782,"I've seen mention of that before, skipping with a baitcaster.  I can't even imagine how. Thumb spool, release, thumb, release, thumb. Seriously, for real? How?"
444551,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-17 02:15:00,4399,underhand flip similar to skipping a stone.
444618,Harrison,2010-03-17 12:33:00,2202," Hey Weeds, I'll try and explain how I personally do it.  I have 2 techniques:  1. side arm underhand roll cast - both hands on the rod and making a counter clockwise circle, releasing the bait so it skims a few inches above the water.  This takes some practice to get the timing and feathering of the spool down pat.  2. this is going to be harder to explain, one day I just started doing this.  Hold the bait as if you are going to pitch it.  I start the rod at 9 o'clock (rod in right hand) and swing it over to 3 o'clock at the same time releasing the bait and feathering the spool. Hard to explain, anyways, the bait will curl in from left to right skimming the top of the water.  Amazing technique for getting up under thick trees and the side/back of docks.  Both techniques the magnets are almost completely off relying on the thumb to control the spool.  I hope the above makes sense and ya can picture it. Phil"
443865,blue pickeral,2010-03-15 00:12:00,267,"First off, I know it's a poor craftsman who blames his tools for bad results. However, would like some feedback from forum members as to the relative ease of use with a Pflueger Trion bait caster. For a couple of years now, I have been trying to master casting with it. I have followed instructions, made the brake and tension adjustments, downloaded videos from Utube - the one how to untangle a bird's nest came in handy - but about every 5th cast goes haywire.  Today I was out on the ice on our lake, well away from branches or other snags, with a nice weighty plastic practice plug (did get to tell a curious neighbour I was ice fishing) but still can't get much consistency. Would I be better off just to get another one that would be easier to use?"
443869,Terry,2010-03-15 00:32:00,14456,no they take concentration and touching the spool with your thumb as needed  the best way to start is make a good long cast  then let out another 25 ft  now use electrical tape and go around the spool twice then reel in the line  that will help prevent backlashes while you are learning then practice..practice practice
443872,blue pickeral,2010-03-15 00:41:00,267, Thanks! Will try this out first thing tomorrow!
443879,MCTFisher9120,2010-03-15 00:54:00,3761,Ya how are casting it out. Are you flinging the rod the second you press the spool release button? If are disregard the rest but engage the spool then put your thumb on it then let it go at the end of the rod fling(u know what I mean haha)...i tried button on the end of the cast movement and it was hell...can somebody re word this for me plz lol
443886,blue pickeral,2010-03-15 01:12:00,267," I get you...After doing the 'dangling' to match reel with lure weight, click button, light thumb pressure on line on reel, draw back arm, nice easy motion forward with a quick push, release thumb, not sure if I get a twist in the wrist at this point or not! When plug hits surface, apply thumb again to stop line going out although am under impression braking should take place?"
443888,kickingfrog,2010-03-15 01:13:00,8333,"Terry's got you headed in the right direction, and I'll assume the videos are useful. You'll hear a lot about an educated thumb. The top end reels can be easier to use and require less ""education"", but nothing replaces practise. Practise does not make perfect, perfect practise makes perfect. As you get better, you will have less and less birdsnests, but you will still get one every now and again to to keep you from getting too smug."
443895,Dano,2010-03-15 01:26:00,719," Boy, isnt that the truth. I always take the baitcasters out in the yard before I hit the water."
443910,Weeds,2010-03-15 01:56:00,782,If you have not already try going with a side arm delivery. Might find it easier.
443911,vance,2010-03-15 02:01:00,719,"The one most important thing that I have discovered about bait casters is that you can not use any form of wrist flick in your cast,it all has to be done with a sweeping arm motion.The attempt at a little greater distance with a little to much oomph usually results in a birds nest.I hope this helps.  vance"
443919,SlowPoke,2010-03-15 02:32:00,2984,"In addition to Terry's suggestion; try thumbing the spool before hitting the water. Eventually you will be doing this to control distance anyway. Trying to time the lure hitting the water is tough. I notice a big difference between casting my first generation citica and curado ""D""s. The difference in quality is likely to help a novice. I think an expert baitcaster (not I) could probably throw a lower end reel with decent success but I could be wrong. Experts chime in?"

443921,spinnerbaitking,2010-03-15 02:33:00,1622,"When you make your cast make sure your handle is either facing up or down not sideways the line drag makes a difference, helped me when I first started using one years ago Richard"
443924,SlowPoke,2010-03-15 02:33:00,2984,"Disengage the spool (click the button) before starting your cast, not during."

443928,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-15 02:56:00,4399,"Baitcasting is really not that hard but there is a few things you can do to make learning easier.  I believe the Trion has internal brakes have you adjusted these? What pound test is on the reel? Are you casting into the wind?  First thing you have to do is make sure the brakes are set properly then the spool tension knob, tighten the tension knob then tie on a bait then press the cast button, nothing should happen. Now slowly turn the tension knob until the bait slowly starts to fall and hits the floor, you should adjust the tension knob until the bait hits the floor and the spool immediately stops. I would suggest trying to cast side arm you don`t need a lot of arm speed to get the bait going just nice and easy and just before the bait hits the water you stop the spool with your thumb if you wait to your bait hits the water your to late and you will get the birds nest. As you get better you can easy off on the spool tension for longer casts.  A couple of other things that are important for a beginner is line don`t spool with light line use 16 pound test and try and avoid casting into the wind that can be a challenge for the best of casters."
443947,GoneFishin,2010-03-15 05:42:00,349,That's a good tip Terry.  What kind of rod are you using? If your trying to cast light baits with a stiff rod that might be your problem. I think it would be easiest learning on a medium fast setup but it all depends on how your fishing..
443953,singingdog,2010-03-15 10:43:00,1047,"I feel your pain. I went through the same learning curve (did we all?).  Try and develop a casting motion that has NO quick changes in speed....no ""snaps"" in either the start-up or finish of your casting stroke. The breakthrough for me was to think of a baitcasting cast as more of a lob than a throw: like you are throwing a ball to a kid that is learning to catch. Later on, you can learn to put some heat on it.  Keep your thumb on the spool all the time while you are learning. You won't get much distance, but you will learn more control.  The tape trick is a life-saver."
443955,Roy,2010-03-15 10:51:00,13728,"I don't know where I went wrong but I have never had a problem with baitcasters. Go fishing with someone who uses baitcasting reels regularly. In closing, may I add, Be one with the reel, Glasshoppah."
443957,cranks bait,2010-03-15 11:27:00,721,"I have the same reel, was my first baitcaster as well.  I really like it.  When I first started I did get a few nests.   Tips I learned were to use a heavier line.  I use 50 lbs power pro on my baitcasters.  Use a heavier lure, as one too light to learn with will be messy.  Press the button to release the brake and use your thumb to control the spool.  Watch out for your finger slipping to hit the handle and brake mid cast....Also don't try and through your lure out hard.  A gentle sweep will be much smoother.  you will gradually get distance but don't focous on that right now.  Have fun and a pick is your friend."
443959,Roy,2010-03-15 11:35:00,13728," Yes, I always have a crochet hook onboard....I thought it could be useful just in case. I've never had to use it but you never know when I might get an urge to make a shawl or a doily or something."
443964,lew,2010-03-15 11:52:00,12766," I'm with you on that one Roy, and I've been using a bait caster for probably 55 years or so and don't recall ever having issues with them.  IMHO, the biggest problem folks seem to have with them is they THINK their difficult to use and almost seem intimidated by them when infact there's actually nothing at all to be concerned with. Just think of a baitcaster as another tool in the box, not unlike a new circ saw or cordless drill that just takes some getting used to.  Baitcasters are VERY simple to use and once you get the hang of it, you'll wonder what the heck all the fuss was about   ....it just takes a bit of practice."
443976,wallyboss,2010-03-15 12:54:00,1095,"  This is one thing that really helped me when I first started. Long distance casting will come with experience, always had a professional overrun whenever I tried to get just a bit more distance with a quick wrist snap at the end of the cast."
443977,steverowbotham,2010-03-15 12:58:00,1800,"One of the biggest factors is line diameter.  Ideally you want a 12lbs diameter or more.  So for braided line that means 50lbs. You can use lighter line, but to learn, its MUCH easier with heavier line."
443987,hirk,2010-03-15 13:30:00,571,"Might help you if you just practice making short pitches first to get your thumb timing down pat.Hold the rod at 10:00 with about 4' of line out,hit and hold release bar/line,now gentley get the bait swinging by bringing the rod up to 12:00 and back down,when the bait is swinging away from you let it go.Once you can do this well a side arm cast should be pretty easy."
443992,JohnF,2010-03-15 13:58:00,3494,"For what it's worth coming from a relative newby, here's what I was told by a couple of helpful folks when I started.  Start with 12-15# mono till you get the hang of it. The idea being if you have some snarls it's cheaper to cut out than braid.  Set the spool brake down fairly tight to prevent it from running ahead of the line. Your casts will be shorter but much more satisfying. As you get more comfortable you can loosen off and try for longer casts. I think this is one of the biggest things for the beginner. I have to remember to tighten down if I'm in windy conditions and/or using lighter lures. It's one of the things I really like about my Quantum Energy reel. The brake is on the outside of the case.  Use a heavy enuf lure (or practice weight) to keep tension on the line. Light lures tend to decelerate and allow spool overrun.  Use two hands. In the beginning it will just be easier. Later on it will help generate speed.  Aim for the sky above the intended target rather than the actual target.  Keep yer thumb ready to brake the spool when the lure lands. You'll get the feel for it as you get more practice and your thumb will soon just do it automatically.  Like Roy and Lew said it came pretty easy when I followed these few tips. I had a lot of fun ripping plastic frogs onto slop last summer. Long casts means lots of water covered.  FWIW JF"
