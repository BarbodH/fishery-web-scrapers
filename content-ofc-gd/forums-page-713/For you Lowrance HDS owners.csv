I understand that you can upgrade to the platinum cards for 3D views etc....I am curious though to know what is included and what else I need for this unit.  GPS/chartplotting is already a feature correct ?  Thanks"
443877,Terry,2010-03-15 00:50:00,14456,"everything else is already there unless it's a HDS5M, if that the case then it's not a fish finder, but it is a monitor for other units but i really think it's the HDS5........."
443952,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-03-15 09:37:00,76,"Correct, it is the HDS 5  I was under the impression that I had to buy a mapping/navionics card to get lake maps (Erie..)"
443972,Dara,2010-03-15 12:38:00,3052,My HDS 7 has a map in it. it shows marker bouys for the great lakes at least. No depth contours. I have a paper chart of the area I fish so I may make do with that rather than spending the money on whatever I need for countours.
443973,ecmilley,2010-03-15 12:49:00,2163,"there is the base lowrance maps, go into your menu and check it out i have the hds-8 and there is all kinds of things you can do for set-up"
443985,ryansusanna,2010-03-15 13:26:00,27,"Lake Erie is included on all the HDS units.  the first year manufactured units have their contour lines in a terrible off white color and it can be tricky to see them.  You do have to choose the LOWRANCE map in the options.  the newer version of the HDS units has the contour lines in a maroon color that is very easy to see.  There is also the units containing the hard drive labeled Insight. These are US maps, but include the great lakes for about $200 more (not much more than a gold chip), and include incredible detail of the great lakes.  i fish erie and ontario and for me this was a no brainier after seeing the content on these units.  if you are going to get a chip, it is important to know where you are going to fish.  Ryan"
443989,Dara,2010-03-15 13:32:00,3052,  So you are saying that I can go into my 7 and turn contour lines on?
444151,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-03-15 23:11:00,76,"If so that makes me happy !  I am mostly going to be fishing Erie, Ontario, Niagara......  So if this is the case and I actually have contour lines I am excited !"
444156,ryansusanna,2010-03-15 23:22:00,27,"for Erie, yes.  for the other lakes, not likely."
