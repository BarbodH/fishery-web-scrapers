444359,mistaredone,2010-03-16 14:27:00,913,I picked up a 75lb Motorguide wireless series bow mount motor from Lebaron for what seemed like a great deal at $630 tax in.  When I got it home I realized the mount is not best suited for bass boats.  It looks like to get sufficient clearance from the bow out of a six bolt pattern mount ill only be able to use four.  Is there an after market bracket out there?  My old motorguide pluged in at the bow.  Now I have a wireless unit what is the best way to wire it clean?  Do I install a switch or plug at the motor?  Any suggestions would be great.  Thanks  Steve
