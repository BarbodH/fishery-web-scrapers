444439,TC1OZ,2010-03-16 19:57:00,987,Topic pretty much sums it up...  Fishing has been pretty slow for me since the summer.  I've found one good carp place off the twelve mile creek but lately all I've been catching are suckers or catfish.  Is there anything else I can hit from shore? Any tips? What should I be targeting?     Side note : I was given an ice fishing rod for christmas but due to an illness I was never shown where/how to ice fish...I'm too scared to just head out to the ice on my own! Any suggestions are welcomed!     (let the flames begin)

Go through the tunnel from St. Kitts to Niagara Falls - take the first right, then take another right, heading towards the canal.  You will go over a small bridge.  Fish from shore near that bridge.  There is a car on the bottom - at least there was back then, that held nice SM Bass and a ton of perch.  I used to catch drum and catfish there too.  I lived in Thorold South for one year in Uni.  One year was enogh, but that was the only spot I could actually find fish in the whole area.  I tried the lake near Brock a few times, but only caught near dead carp."
