444286,cram,2010-03-16 03:33:00,1733,Absolutely love the bottom four spinnerbaits.
444299,CLofchik,2010-03-16 08:38:00,854,"Jeez you guys sure like your baits pretty, but do they catch only pretty fish?  (Youse got a purty mouth......)  May I present, the FuglySpoonâ„¢, the lumpiest, fugliest hunk of bargain brass ever to be flung off the concrete.        "
444306,SlowPoke,2010-03-16 09:35:00,2984,  I'll take 5 of each in every colour! Nice work!
444307,solopaddler,2010-03-16 09:41:00,8605,Glaucus that's very impressive! Is this a hobby or do you sell them? I'm interested if you do.
444310,Paully,2010-03-16 10:35:00,712, I've never seen a tube with fuzz .. Looks cool but do the hairs stay in the plastic after a few fish?  If im not mistaken thats a micro tube.. Have you ever tried to make a large version ?
444331,Harrison,2010-03-16 12:24:00,2202," Ok, I am Lovin this one, do you take custom orders?  If so, I would take a few of each in 3/4 and 1oz.  No joke."
444343,solopaddler,2010-03-16 13:22:00,8605, I agree I've never seen a tube dressed like that either. If you want a very similar bait fuzzy grubs are readily available.
444352,Harrison,2010-03-16 13:36:00,2202," I have used them before, however the rubber/plastic was solid.  If these are hollow and your able to use a 1/16 or 1/32 regular tube jighead I would like to order a few dozen of these too!"
444474,troutboy,2010-03-16 21:41:00,125,"I cant post the pictures of my jig flies for huge brookies,check out my flickr! http://www.flickr.com/photos/chris15/"
444484,Smitty1,2010-03-16 22:28:00,29,Hey Guys  Here are a few I have made over the years....      
444588,Glaucus,2010-03-17 05:14:00,48,"Thanks!!..but are 5 of each in every colour enough?  Thank you! This is just a hobby for now...I might sell them once I perfect them  That tube is about 3"" long. The marabou was molded into melted plastisol, and the plastic would probably tear before the feathers would come out.  I only made about 10 of those and gave them away before trying them  I'm not selling any yet. I still have to finish making a lure rotator so that the epoxy top coat cures evenly. Right now I hang the lures and let the epoxy drip off. There's a small blob of dried epoxy on the hook shank, though covered by the skirt, but it still looks unprofessional.  That is a hollow tube. These take way too long to make and sell. They take from 10-15 minutes each to make. I wrote up how I make them here:  http://www.tackleunderground.com/community...65-fuzzy-tubes/"
444594,solopaddler,2010-03-17 09:39:00,8605,You're a talented man Glaucus. You've got a customer here if you ever decide to sell your baits.
444607,fish_fishburn,2010-03-17 12:01:00,1311,Glaucus. the buzzbaits with the spoon and the red dot.... very interesting to say the least. I love using buzzbaits for them early risers.
444617,Spiel,2010-03-17 12:31:00,9065,  I'm fortunate enough to own one of these beauties thanks to Smitty1 and I'll tell you the largies love it!
444620,Harrison,2010-03-17 12:43:00,2202, DITTO!
422770,mepps,2010-01-16 00:17:00,1301,"Hey guys, I know a lot of enjoy making our own lures so I'd share some of my new designs and see if anyone is interested in trading for their own designs.  I've been making my own spinnerbaits for a few years now and they've been getting better every year. Each of these lures is 7-8 inches long with #7 french blades   Post your home made lures too!                 "
422781,Spiel,2010-01-16 00:28:00,9065,"Those look killer Clive. Very well constructed.  I never dabbled much in lures but as I recently noted in this thread,  http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.p...=39277&st=0  I've gotten back into fly tying.  "
422783,mepps,2010-01-16 00:30:00,1301,"Nicely done! I've only made a few flies myself, but I did make a big 7 inch muskie fly (cant find the pics right now)  Your flies turned out much better then mine!"
422797,I'mHooked,2010-01-16 00:52:00,525,Wow! Exceptional examples of some nice work guys!
422840,bigugli,2010-01-16 03:02:00,6138,"Nice looking stuff guys. Don't know much about fly tying but those look quite lifelike. The inline spinners are sharp. Me, I tie bucktail harnesses and bucktail jigs  "
422845,Leecher,2010-01-16 03:10:00,7832,Awesome works guys May be I should switch to doing some of that in the future Leechman

422906,Hooked,2010-01-16 05:00:00,891," I have to say, Hellgrammites really creep me out, and Chris, those jigs creep me out, nice job man, real nice.  Think we'll have to do some business soon."

423006,solopaddler,2010-01-16 16:57:00,8605," Amazing Chris, just amazing. Now that I've finally seen them how about some black and white maribou muddlers tied on 1/8oz jig heads?"
423007,Spiel,2010-01-16 17:00:00,9065,"  I might be able to do that Mike.  For all those other do it youselfers, some great looking lures there. No doubt all are effective fish foolers."

424407,Kinger,2010-01-21 06:28:00,351,"I just finished tying my first batch of steelhead/salmon jigs.  Go easy, as I am a noob.              Its already very addictive. I painted a few of the jigheads myself by layering nail polish and clear laquer.  I look forward to experimenting in the rapids until I find some jig that they just cannot resist."
424414,Spiel,2010-01-21 10:54:00,9065,"Those look great Kinger, some nice colour combinations."
424427,Kinger,2010-01-21 12:21:00,351,Thanks I appreciate that!
