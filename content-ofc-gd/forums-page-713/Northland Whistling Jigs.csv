443968,superdad,2010-03-15 12:21:00,353,"They used to be the cats meow a number of years ago on Hay Bay, couldn't catch without them, NOW no one uses them. Fish got used to them...  David  aka  Superdad"
443970,Calender Don,2010-03-15 12:24:00,39,Dragged bottom with a worm for walleye in Lake Nipissing I like them.
443971,Eazy,2010-03-15 12:27:00,260,It's pretty amazing how fish can get used to baits!
443974,wallyboss,2010-03-15 12:50:00,1095,I use them whenever I fish muddy waters.  Helps the walleyes center in on the jigs.  I use a very hard 1-2 feet rip so that I can feel the vibration it in my rod tip.
443975,Radnine,2010-03-15 12:53:00,1538," I keep wondering how long it will be before Lake Erie smallies get used to Senkos and tube jigs. I hope never, but it would seem to be inevitable. Unless of course, fish never do actually get used to baits, and it is just something that has been propagated by the lure manufacturing industry. I mean, fish have been eating minnows and other fish for ever right? They don't stop eating minnows. Jim"

444067,Eazy,2010-03-15 19:30:00,260,During the hard or soft water season?.....Gotta love it when the Brookies are on too!
444111,smitter,2010-03-15 21:20:00,106,"they are killer for walleye and brookies, I've only ever used the in open water though.  btw, I don't think can fish really get that used to lures, maybe locally or for a short period of time, but, how long have mepps black fury, red devil spoons, floating rapalas etc. been around for and they still kill."
444226,Eazy,2010-03-16 01:26:00,260,"I know what you mean,and have heard of steelhead getting used to some types of hardware when they're exposed to it in higher pressure situations and such, ie: cleos and what have you."
