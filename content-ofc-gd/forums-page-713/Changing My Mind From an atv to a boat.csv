I will probably get a lot more use out of it anyways. Are older evinrude outboards pretty reliable? Dont know the exact year yet but it is all white in color of that helps lol.

444175,danbouck,2010-03-16 00:03:00,4380,"You won't have any issues with an old ""rude"""
444240,livinisfishin,2010-03-16 02:01:00,661,"yeah its all white, any idea of the era?"
444244,livinisfishin,2010-03-16 02:06:00,661,"actually i see where there might be blue, really really really faded blue"
444246,fish-miester,2010-03-16 02:10:00,864,well you could always get an argo  best of both worlds
444258,Carp,2010-03-16 02:28:00,1488,"I have a 14 ft. Princecraft with a 1978- 35hp Evinrude. Runs excellent and trolls slow for lakers or walleye if needed.  Did some work to it when I got it about 13 years ago (new cdi pack, tune-up, electrical wiring, prop) Never had a problem after all the work was completed."
444264,livinisfishin,2010-03-16 02:31:00,661,thats pretty sweet that its still running great. sounds like this boat is the way to go! A 20 hp would push the boat pretty good wouldnt it?
444268,fish-miester,2010-03-16 02:38:00,864,yes a 20 would push the 14 quite nicely. i have a 9.9 on my 14 right now and its nice to cruise around in when its calm out .. but i would defenetly suggest getting a 20 minimum. it will get you to point A to B nicely as well as it can go nice and slow..
