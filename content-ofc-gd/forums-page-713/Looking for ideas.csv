This year the son wants to try a different lake I would like to stay in the Minden,Haliburton,Bancroft area my son is open on the area. I was thinking Paudash lake the son suggested the French River obviously we need good Bass fishing and a cabin/cottage.  Any thoughts and suggestions would be appreciated."
444523,Radnine,2010-03-17 01:02:00,1538,We just had a thread like this about two weeks ago (which might explain the lack of responses?) Aha! Found it. http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=41160 Jim
444540,lookinforwalleye,2010-03-17 01:40:00,4399,"  Well my son is 32 not 2 and a half,not looking for panfish, I have a trailer on Dalrymple,not interested in lakes with a million cottages and jet skis,don`t need a beach or a playground and will go 6 hours.  Thank you!"
444544,irishfield,2010-03-17 01:53:00,26272,If you're interested in Lake Temagami let me know. Cottage on the opposite end of my island rents from time to time.
444545,Ryan Landry,2010-03-17 01:59:00,128,"The bass fishing is awsome, lots of heavy cover. There are about 50 cottages on the lake, and a few jet skis. It's probably a little closer to home than you were looking for but give it a look! http://www.ofncommunity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=41594  Thanks, Ryan"
444549,ADB,2010-03-17 02:08:00,444,"You can try Stanton Air.  They do fly-in trips for under $500/person.  The best part is, you only have to drive to Orillia, where their base is.  Their lakes are all bass fishing, besides the odd splake.  I've fished one of there lakes before and their are plenty of fish.   We did very well considering we were in the middle of a cold front."
444580,adempsey,2010-03-17 04:07:00,1498,"I liked fishing Jack Lake, but only went once and will be back this year.   I think there is only 1 place that rents cottages on this lake, but I could be mistaken.  I find Pigeon Lake has some good fishing.  I mainly fish for walleye and musky here though, but I am pretty sure there is good bass fishing as well.  Somewhat busy lake, but mostly houseboats.  Rice Lake has great smallie and largie bass fishing.  Occasional Jet skiis, but not that bad and depends on what time of year you go.  French River is really nice as well, especially once you enter the park.   Only fished for pike/musky here in Autumn.  I went to Paudash once and I got circled by water skiers, but that will happen on most lakes near the cities mid-summer.  Bill Rivers site (http://www.ontariofisherman.com/bass-specialists.htm) recommended Elephant Lake Lodge (http://www3.sympatico.ca/elephant.lake/info.html) and Stanton Air (http://www.stantonair.com/) for bass fishing.  In 2005 Outdoor Canada recommended Rice, Pigeon, Gull, Balsam, Sturgeon Lakes as Smallmouth bass HotSpots (http://www.outdoorcanada.ca/fish/hot_spots05j.shtml).  Cam Brownson (The Angler & Hunter) and Ray Carignan (Outdoor Passion) picked Rice Lake as a Largemouth hotspot (http://articles.outdoorcanada.ca/Homepage/...-n258334p3.html; http://articles.outdoorcanada.ca/Homepage/...n258334p4.html).  Ron James & Leo Stakos (Fish TV) picked Pigeon Lake as a Largemouth and Crappie hotspot and Rice Lake as a Walleye Hotspot (http://articles.outdoorcanada.ca/Homepage/...-n258443p5.html).  Barry Pringle & Aaron Shirley (Getting Hooked with Aaron & Barry) picked Rice Lake as a Walleye Hotspot (http://articles.outdoorcanada.ca/Homepage/...-n258451p5.html).  Anyway, if you are focused on bass I'd take a good look into Rice Lake and Pigeon Lake.   Also, I have learned that everything on Bill Rivers site seems to be echoed by many other anglers.  Good luck!"

My biggest Largemouth is just over 6lbs and my biggest smallie is just over 3lbs there are average sized pike and my biggest is ~ 30""  There are walleye in the lake but few and far between in the late summer when I go, Ice guys seem to do ok from the pics I see in the lodge. Here's a few of my pics....           jjcanoe"

444609,DanD,2010-03-17 12:05:00,2223,"If you’re thinking of going as far as the French; why not a little further and try the West bay/west arm of Nipissing? I’m surprised no one else here hasn't suggested it; lots of water, lots of different structure; get up in the morning and then decide on what you’re going to fish for, that day. Even with a fair number of camps/lodges and cottagers; with the amount of water, you can fish all day and the closes you’ll ever have to get to another boat, is at the dock of one of the lodges to pick up some bait. Have a look at the listings that TJ has at this link http://www.ontariofishing.net/linkspages/F...Lake_Nipissing/ There’s Lakair, Memquisit, Saenchiur flechey to just name a few; their rates are all pretty competitive; it just depends on where you want to make your base camp. The only caution I have about the West bay is that it is skag heaven because of all the rock shoals; I had a rock come up and take a bite out of my motor the one year. LOL But you learn fast where and what is safe and you probably already know this; some of the best fishing is skirting those shoals. I’ve been going there for a number of years now; but if it where going to be some one’s first time and again because of the amount of water; I would suggest hiring one of the lodges guides for a half day. They’ll be able to take you to some of their “hot spots” and show you some of their techniques; that’ll give you a starting point to find your own.  Dan."
