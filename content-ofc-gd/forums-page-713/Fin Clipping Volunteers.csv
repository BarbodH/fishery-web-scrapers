444280,John Bacon,2010-03-16 03:07:00,3277,"Volunteers are needed for fin clipping at Ringwood hatchery next week; especially if you can come in during the day.  Metro East Anglers will be clipping adipose fins for all Chinook to be stocked in pens.  The pen locations are: Wellington, Whitby Harbour, Oshawa, Dalhousie, Bluffers Park and Darlington.  Pen rearing the fish for six weeks prior to release is been shown to improve the fishes' survival and improve returns.  If we are not able to clip enough fish; then we may not have fish for all pen locations.  If you would like an opportunity to improve the Chinook fisher, especially if you fish any of those locations; try to drop by Ringwood next week and help out.  PM me or drop by the Ringwood site if you need more information.  http://ringwoodfcs.proboards.com/index.cgi?"
