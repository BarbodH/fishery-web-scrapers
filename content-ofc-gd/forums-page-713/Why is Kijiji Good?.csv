444811,Rizzo,2010-03-17 23:09:00,4754,"similar experience to Lew...I posted my boat here a couple of years ago, after a month of no interest put it on Kijiji for more money (was willing to give OFC discount) and sold it within days!  Some people on Kijiji are pretty thick though. i advertised some Blizzak winter tires ON RIMS on Kijiji for like $20 each, telling people the tires had maybe a season left, basically selling the rims but you get the tires that are on it. You wouldn't believe the dummies calling and asking how new the tires were..year old? like new? Read the ad doorknobs, they're 20.00 each including the rim"

I built two of them over the winter for guys in BC that bought brand new Sportspals from the mfg/dealer out there.
444272,splashhopper,2010-03-16 02:49:00,2931,"  You got it Dan..  Got a 13' Sportspal... site unseen... for FIFTY BUCKS !... (Included two paddles, two foams seats, and some old bungee chords.)   It leaks a little,  about 2 quarts of water in 5 hours of fishing... i can handle that.  I also got a 32lb thrust trolling motor, battery for 140.  Had to buy the mount for the motor(new) for 37 bucks though  I took the canoe out for a test run within and hour of getting it....  Here is the feeeesh that christened my Kijiji Sportspal jewel in the rough      I also have an ad posted on kijiji... where I am looking to trade my service for 14-16 aluminum boat with motor and trailer. One hit so far... but the guys boat was junk ( see a Vega) and he wanted a Cadillac bathroom.  No worries..."
