I'm guessing the selection will probably be better at the store? But perhaps the newer stuff are at the show?  One thing I learnt from past event is that sometimes they might bump the price for certain items up just a bit for the sale, so you might not save as much as you think.  Regardless of their little tricks, I usually find myself enjoying this event  LeBaron No Tax Sale Flyer No tax on regular items, I don't think you  can combine with the club 10% membership on top. Sale items are excluded so are other things mentioned in the fine print.  No, I don't work for them, just a customer who has spent ridiculous amount of money there, and for many years to come."

444401,mbosh1980,2010-03-16 16:51:00,349,I couldn't use my card when I went today.
444427,Jet,2010-03-16 19:06:00,364,  That's sad to hear. Last time they had the no-tax sale I also got the membership discount and loaded up as a result.
444444,mbosh1980,2010-03-16 20:02:00,349,"Same here! Last time I went right back in and bought another $150 worth of gear.  I asked the girl if she was sure, and she said yes."
444495,MuskyGreenHorn,2010-03-16 23:12:00,158,Wierd.  That doesn't add up.  If you pay for membership you should get to use it.
444500,tschirk,2010-03-16 23:31:00,261,"With the dollar approaching parity and on track to hit $1.07US by July, you would think they would be a little more price aggressive.... I just looked at a Yamaha ATV and it was $3,000 more in Canada than US...   :-("
444506,Rizzo,2010-03-16 23:43:00,4754, ...I also saw a pig today that looked like it was about to take flight...but then it farted and sat back down
444520,tschirk,2010-03-17 00:33:00,261,I take it you disagree?
