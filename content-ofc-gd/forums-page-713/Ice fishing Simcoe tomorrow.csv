I was wondering if anyone has been out there recently, and how bad the slush is, because I will be walking out.  I was thinking either IBP or BBP, I have fished Roaches a couple times this year with some success for perch, but wanted to try for some Whitefish or maybe even Lakers.  If anyone wants to join me, they are more than welcome, I dont really know Simcoe that well, but I like to get out and try!"
