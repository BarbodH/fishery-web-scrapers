444463,nodie,2010-03-16 20:56:00,34,Anyone know where to get a Shimano Sedona 750FB spool just by itself? Or anyone have one for sale?  Thanks  Olivier
444704,bare foot wader,2010-03-17 17:04:00,1354,I'm struggling with this as well.....looking for 500 fb spool....any input would be greatly appreciated...shimano email customer service leaves much to be desired....been brand loyal for a long time but it's shaping up to be the summer of change....  does anybody also know where to order japan shimano products in north america?
