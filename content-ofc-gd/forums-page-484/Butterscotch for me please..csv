625783,strakey,2011-09-28 14:03:00,78,  Even better!!! Read the other replys and noticed big streamer. Man those fish can be piggies when they want to be.
625815,corvette1,2011-09-28 15:32:00,1765,nice one bill awesome colors
625826,johnnyb,2011-09-28 15:54:00,3413,Fantastic fish....what a thrill on (what I'm guessing was) a small creek.  Well done!
625881,blaque,2011-09-28 17:55:00,2419,Crappy pics?? I'd like to see your good pics. I think they look great!
625907,Hairpy,2011-09-28 19:15:00,73,Nice fish Bill! See any atlantics in your travels?  Joseph
625925,misfish,2011-09-28 20:03:00,29133,Nice fish Bill. You got that where you said you were going to hit up? That is a nice stretch of water thats for sure.
625930,lookinforwalleye,2011-09-28 20:18:00,4399, Have you ever tried down my way for Brownie`s?
626322,Spiel,2011-09-29 18:43:00,9065," Nicely done Bill, awesome fish!   "
626325,asdve23rveavwa,2011-09-29 18:46:00,2690,"Absolutely stunning brownie, Bill"
626357,JTorra,2011-09-29 19:47:00,50,Don't worry Bill...Davey was still calling you names over that one even though he wasn't there... 
625608,BillM,2011-09-28 00:51:00,17367,"Not much takes my breath away, but a big bullet butterscotch brownie does!  Crappy pics, but I wasn't in very ideal conditions to break out the DSLR.  Big fish measured in at just under 24inches.  My PB when it comes to resident browns.  Long, lean and definitely mean!  Went 2 for 2 on the night, other one measured in just under the 20inch range.   "

625622,BillM,2011-09-28 01:15:00,17367," GPS co-ordinates to follow, lol!!!!"
625623,MJL,2011-09-28 01:17:00,2427,Very sweet Bill  It'll be the 2nd season in a row for me not breaking the 20 inch mark
625624,Rizzo,2011-09-28 01:18:00,4754," don't bother, everyone recognizes that spot. Next time blur out the background  :blahblah1:  nice fish by the way"
625625,timmeh,2011-09-28 01:23:00,609,Absolute beauty. Did ya take him on a big streamer?
625628,Miracon,2011-09-28 01:25:00,200, Not that I'll even pretend to understand half of what that meant (except DSLR!)...nice fish!!!!!
625630,muskymike,2011-09-28 01:26:00,772,Awesome Bill.  What type of camera are you using? All of your pics look like someone who knows how to fish was with you....
625631,BillM,2011-09-28 01:30:00,17367," Canon 60D with a 10-22mm UWA lens.  To be honest, I was hoping my buddy Dave was going to make it out, but the stars didn't align.   It's tough taking decent pics by yourself, lol.  timmeh:  Big streamer was the ticket!"

625637,msp,2011-09-28 01:36:00,1336,Nice one Bill !
625645,ketchenany,2011-09-28 01:49:00,3229,  I won't tell. Nice fish Bill . . . .
625657,splashhopper,2011-09-28 02:04:00,2931,nice fish....
625658,wallacio,2011-09-28 02:05:00,475, Way to go buddy...two fish like that in one evening is no small feat.   I really wished that I could have joined you tonight.   In time I'll forgive you for getting that big guy...I've only been after him all season
625659,BillM,2011-09-28 02:06:00,17367,"I needed one over 20 man, I wasn't expecting that brute!  LOL!!!"
625667,sleepjigging,2011-09-28 02:27:00,207,"I am envious. I am usually fishing bass/walleye/pike, so a Big Beautiful Trout like that is awesome. So, I wish to learn:  What is a big streamer? Is it like a fly? And the brown trout is a stream only fish right? It's not migrating for the spawn?  Thanks,  Jiggy"
625671,GBW,2011-09-28 02:31:00,8460,"I trip over one of those rod's every time I go out so yeah I know it too...  PS, NICE FISH Bill!"
625673,wallacio,2011-09-28 02:34:00,475, I'm glad you fooled him bud and not someone else.  I have a feeling that old guy doesn't get tricked very often!
625674,BillM,2011-09-28 02:39:00,17367," Yeah, it's a type of fly.  The fish I caught tonight are residents, which means they reside in the river all year round.  They don't live in the lake, then come in to spawn like the steelhead do.  However, I'm sure they migrate throughout the entire system depending on the season."
625682,Cudz,2011-09-28 03:07:00,2652,In the mouth  nice fish Bill
625689,northernpike56,2011-09-28 03:48:00,717,sweet fish
