I wish I had someone with me to operate the camera on Saturday because it was my best day ( size wise ) on LSC to date. Im not even going to get into it because I dont have pictures to back it up ! haha Sunday however was just as epic, I would have to say it was the most fun I have had on that lake I think so far ! We fished 5-7 ft of water for the most part of the day. I started using a spinnerbait and took a couple fish..... once I realized there were fish in the area, I switched to a loud crank bait to call them in, and it was the ticket !!!! We caught fish on everything we got wet.... but the consistant bite was on cranks. The fish are aggresive right now..... but we only had a couple fish that had followers with them. So it seems as though they are just cruising flats chompin down on bait fish by there lonesome.  Heres a couple teasers from Sunday     Couple 3 lbs + fish    4 lbs + twins...... I LOVE the fall !!!!!"
