Does anyone know anywhere online or perhaps somewhere near parry sound you can get topographical maps?  thanks"

626174,woodenboater,2011-09-29 12:52:00,2277,Mountain Equipment Co-op should have them. Depending on where you're putting in and how far downriver you're paddling there are a couple of good portages and rapids to bypass (Sellars comes to mind if you don't have class 3+ skills)). I've run from Ahmic down to Britt and be aware that there's reserve land on the lower Mag so camping will be minimal. Also the Mag is chock full of poison ivy.

626204,TheoSteel,2011-09-29 13:57:00,4,If you have a GPS (Garmin )you can buy the Canada Topo maps and load them into you GPS . Mapsource maps can be had at walmart canadian tire and stores like that
626213,slightlyhuman,2011-09-29 14:42:00,29," unfortunately no garmin, just an old magellin unit from the early century. really only bringing it along incase we get lost we can track our route back.  thanks for the tips, i'll check MEC tonight for some maps.  I'm heading out of Harris Lake, north of Parry Sound, not doing the area near burks falls."
