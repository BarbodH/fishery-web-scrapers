I just got a weekend offer of fishing on Big Hawk Lake and of course said yes! I've been trying to research but everything seems outdated.  Just wondering what to fill the tackle box with... Any info would be appreciated. Would love some pike action if possible, missed Nippising this year.  Should be a great time and a great warm up for Buckhorn Thanksgiving weekend!"
