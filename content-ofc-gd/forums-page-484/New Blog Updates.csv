Finally, I can write about the new prototype outboard I got to test-drive last month (hint - it's an all-new Mercury 150 four-stroke!!). And Ford has some new F150 news for 2012. A Canadian boat company has a new lift that lets anglers in wheechairs get into and out of boats easily.  Anyway, lots of new stuff on my blog for those interested ....."
