626364,johnnyb,2011-09-29 20:00:00,3413,That hurts more than looking at Terry's avatar!
626365,GBW,2011-09-29 20:00:00,8460,um...
626383,mercman,2011-09-29 21:55:00,7054,  Dude !!!! Excellent legs
626395,Remastered,2011-09-29 22:41:00,143, Stop it! It's turning me on!
626398,Terry,2011-09-29 22:48:00,14456,OMG  this thread has taken a nasty turn for the worst   LOL
626402,irishfield,2011-09-29 22:54:00,26272,It is sad when it comes right down to it. The illusive trout finally caught and photographed and it's disappeared as the highlight.
626404,Roy,2011-09-29 23:24:00,13728,"Wayne, the guys think it's funny but wait to see the expressions on their faces when TJ shows them the first copies of his book on the aurora trout...complete with photographs."
626421,adolson,2011-09-30 00:27:00,783,"You're right... It's obviously a major event for him and really the entire board, and I came in and ruined it. Apologies to cl_fishin."
626437,HTHM,2011-09-30 01:07:00,4082,"I would not say that you ruined it, but rather our collective reaction to the percieved frustration that you may or may not have felt is what brought this thread off track. I was one of the first offenders, so I should apologize as well. Ya gotta admit though, it is kinda funny, your well documented and entertaining quest for this trophy fish to be supplanted by cl_fishin's success."
626440,Rizzo,2011-09-30 01:14:00,4754,"I feel educated and weird after reading this thread. Educated because I've never heard of one of these fish until recently...and weird, well it explains itself (I can't get those legs out of my mind)"
626447,Remastered,2011-09-30 01:25:00,143, > let the picture soak in and enjoy it...
626450,mercman,2011-09-30 01:38:00,7054,"  Don't sweat it Dana.Most of us have no idea of the significace of this fish Personally, never heard of it before, probably wont ever see one, either.I can't appreciate what all the fuss is about,cause i dont fish em.And i'm not alone."
626451,cl_fishin,2011-09-30 01:42:00,138,"No apologies are necessary, sure the fish is cool, but Dana's pic was funny too, I never did sense any animosity, just good natured fun. I am proud/lucky to have caught that fish and hope to try again someday but I have a sense of humor as well and that pic was funny. I am thankful for all the congrats its really cool, when I posted it I didn't think that many people would care or even know about them. They are a very cool fish with a great story behind them, and I highly recommend giving them a try. Heres a few pics of the lake the next morning before we left, it was creation at its best!!   "
626457,fishin jesus,2011-09-30 02:04:00,53,Just simply AWESOME!!!!!!  did you take it on a Streamer???
625476,northernpike56,2011-09-27 19:39:00,717,  
625488,adolson,2011-09-27 20:06:00,783, You inspired me to give it one more try. I went down at lunch and I got one! I am so happy!!!! Here's the pic:  
625489,Musky or Specks,2011-09-27 20:07:00,2710,AAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!  Deserves its own thread with all the gory details
625490,capt bruce,2011-09-27 20:11:00,820," Was Thinking PHOTO SHOP but you got the uneven self brought on hair due ,that is new , so it must be true . Good on ya Dana keep at a thing and good will come thu .Nudge nudge wink wink  post edited for spelling"
625493,Joeytier,2011-09-27 20:23:00,3990,Beautiful!  And on the centrepin to boot.  musta been a huge thrill.
625502,Rod Caster,2011-09-27 21:10:00,5784," I see you got a new reel, two new rods and one hell of a new workout routine! You had me for a second."
625505,capt bruce,2011-09-27 21:16:00,820,"With the new hairdew , right side longer than left , and the buff bod he does make a fine picture dont ya think , wink wink ,you will get one Dana , damn with that combo of hair and muscle what hot little trout wouldnt die to get into a boat with you ."
625506,adolson,2011-09-27 21:17:00,783,"No, that's my Spirex reel in the pic!"
625511,capt bruce,2011-09-27 21:30:00,820,"No, that's my Spirex reel in the pic!   Thought at first he said spandex reel and maybe an AHBRA ,"
625516,Musky or Specks,2011-09-27 21:41:00,2710,Can't believe I fell for that. NO MORE HINTS FOR YOU!!!! BACK OF THE LINE
625517,Rod Caster,2011-09-27 21:50:00,5784," Hahahaha. Sinclair called it... Dana posting that photo was Dana exploding.  Back to the OP ... I'm glad to see an OFNer pulled off the ""impossible"" I'm inspired to give it another shot as well. 3 years is a long time to wait for another opportunity."
625534,the spirit of fishing,2011-09-27 22:19:00,141,Congrats!!!!! I was hoping to get out this year to get another one but too many things happening when I hoped to go-so it was no go.... I'm pondering next year though... Let me guess that you more worried about losing that fish than any you've ever had on the line. It's a beauty and I'm sure you'll always remember all the details of catching it.
625546,spincast,2011-09-27 23:01:00,3279,congrats.
625574,adolson,2011-09-28 00:01:00,783," Oh yeah? Saturday? Sunday? Gonna be freaking COLD, though!"
625981,johnl,2011-09-28 23:05:00,197,nice fish something most of us will never catch
626027,reelinrolly,2011-09-29 01:05:00,281,Nice Fish.......Good old floatfishing seems to take most of the beauts....lol
626031,northernpike56,2011-09-29 01:15:00,717,  awsome!!!!!!
626139,WeedLine,2011-09-29 04:43:00,322,Great fish.  You'll being thinking about that one for a while
626291,Dozer,2011-09-29 17:44:00,896,"Dana you are hilarious!  I think you're head grew from the last picture I've seen of you and damn, nicely groomed!     Great picture and great catch OP."
626313,adolson,2011-09-29 18:22:00,783,"You'd have a big head, too, if you caught an aurora trout!"
626334,cl_fishin,2011-09-29 19:10:00,138,"Seeing another man holding my Trout, and even wearing my pants, I feel so violated"
626336,johnnyb,2011-09-29 19:17:00,3413,So funny
626337,GBW,2011-09-29 19:19:00,8460,Ah HAHAHAHA!!!  now I just sit and wait for TJ's face to be on it too...
626339,Harrison,2011-09-29 19:20:00,2202,Ha!!!!  Has a Belushi feel to it!
626361,adolson,2011-09-29 19:54:00,783, Is this one better? 
625325,cl_fishin,2011-09-27 13:17:00,138,"An Aurora Trout lake was open this year quite close to my annual fall fishing trip area, so I decided to try for one. These fish have always interested me and it was great to finally get a crack at fishing for them and actually landing one. Very cool experience!   "
625330,cl_fishin,2011-09-27 13:25:00,138,Sorry did I do something wrong??
625331,adolson,2011-09-27 13:25:00,783,"Well, I know it wasn't at Liberty Lake!  Looks like it in the pic though..  Congrats. Obviously I don't know how to use a fishing rod."
625332,HTHM,2011-09-27 13:25:00,4082,I feel for him.
625340,cl_fishin,2011-09-27 13:36:00,138,"My friend who was with me trying as well did not catch one either, I was just the fortunate one that day"
625342,fishindevil,2011-09-27 13:38:00,6254,"just awesome man !!! congrats,thats on my bucket list for sure...one day...great pics thanks for sharing...cheers"
625343,Musky or Specks,2011-09-27 13:38:00,2710,Can you share your techniques with those of us who have been trying to catch one for years. Bait/lure/casting/depth etc as much as your willing to divulge. And though I am deeply jealous and bitter congrats
625344,adolson,2011-09-27 13:39:00,783,"If you don't mind sharing, what did you get it on? I don't have a fly rod (yet) and it looks to me like maybe that's what you used? I haven't decided if I'm going to try again once more this year or not.. Actually, I probably won't. I still don't think they exist in Liberty."
625347,GBW,2011-09-27 13:44:00,8460,"So was I...  Nice fish!  It's okay Dana, we can change the name to Ghost fish for you for now."
625349,Jds63,2011-09-27 13:47:00,1365,"very nice, truly a special moment I am sure !!"
625350,Roy,2011-09-27 13:50:00,13728,"TJ might be interested in borrowing your pictures. He'll log on and see it.  Congrats to you, good job."
625358,cl_fishin,2011-09-27 14:29:00,138,"I flogged the lake with everything that I would use for Brookies, Spinners, Spoons, small cranks, flies, and small minnowbaits, all to no avail. So, I went back to the truck grabbed my float rod/centerpin combo that I had with me and riggged it up. I used a float, a few shot, 3lb Fluorcarbon leader a small hook and a Gulp bait, threw it close to the biggest branchiest laydown tree in the lake and waited. With all the gear I had with me it came down to keep it simple, I also believe they are more accessable in the fall because the cooler temps allow them to forage in shallower water, so its easier to to target them around cover like wood etc."
625360,Rod Caster,2011-09-27 14:32:00,5784,What a catch! Once in a lifetime catch for many of us... Very jealous. Dana: I'm betting you'll be out there this weekend after seeing these photos haha
625364,Musky or Specks,2011-09-27 14:47:00,2710,Thanks for the info. I've felt fall would be the best time as well. Three Thanksgiving weekend trips to the Timmins area over the last ten years have ended up in skunkings. Going to have to try still fishing a technique I have not used.
625367,bushart,2011-09-27 14:50:00,2628,"This falls under one of those ""Lifetime Moments""  Definite congrats"
625369,TJQ,2011-09-27 14:52:00,7806,That's fantastic.. not a lot of pictures of them floating around.  and yes if it ok with you I would LOVE to add those pictures to my Aurora Trout Website
625374,adolson,2011-09-27 15:00:00,783,"Hey cl_fishin, what time of day was it when you went? I know early in the season you have to get down deep and worms work best, and, I was told by the one guy there who caught one (along with two others who were with him) that you had to be there first thing in the morning. I'm guessing it maybe changed now that the temperature is going down? If I don't have to get up at 4am, that increases my will to try again.  Congrats, again, anyhow. I can't tell if your success is encouraging to me, or discouraging.   I doubt it.. I don't have a fishing partner this weekend and I promised the wife I wouldn't make her go back there because it's hard on her, getting up at 4am, sitting in the car for an hour and a half or so, rough road, etc. My cousin is unavailable, and my other local friend says it's too early to fish and he's scared of canoes or something.  At the same time, I can't fail if I don't try! haha  But it's tempting, that's for sure. I do plan to try for brookies ASAP though, since I missed out on lakers this year and that disgusting ice is coming sooner than I want it too... (Maybe I'll learn to love it.)"
625375,LucG,2011-09-27 15:00:00,779,Congrats on hooking the elusive aurora!
625382,Joey,2011-09-27 15:06:00,9122,"Beautiful fish, congrats."
625405,rocheleauc,2011-09-27 15:42:00,205,"Very nice, congrats!"
625406,johnnyb,2011-09-27 15:42:00,3413,"Ohhh my gosh that thing is beautiful.  Nicely done...you threw everything you had and came up with a winner.  C'MON DANA....get out there one more time!!!!  And yes, you will learn to love the ice"
625408,mercman,2011-09-27 16:00:00,7054, You kill me man !!! You will get one Dana !! I can almost garantee it.
625410,cl_fishin,2011-09-27 16:10:00,138,"T.J. - sure go ahead  Dana -  I got mine in the evening, but there seemed to be more activity in the morning"
625455,Cookslav,2011-09-27 18:22:00,1457,Very cool!  Congrats on a unique catch!!! Beautifull coloring on them.
625460,Terry,2011-09-27 18:36:00,14456,"cool  the only time I tried to get them  they had closed the lake, even though thier website said it was opened  some day I will get one"
