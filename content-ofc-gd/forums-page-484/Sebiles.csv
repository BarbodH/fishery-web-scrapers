626189,Oryx,2011-09-29 13:23:00,186,"On my last outing, i started using a Sebile Koolie minnow and was watching the bass inhale it like no tomorrow.   Now I would like to try some of their other offerings.  Who in the GTA sells thes products? (Bought mine via EBAY as I could not locate a dealer at the time)  Any help would be greatly appreciated.    Thank you"
626195,fishindevil,2011-09-29 13:39:00,6254,im pretty certain gagnons sports in oshawa has them ?? good luck
626200,johnnyb,2011-09-29 13:42:00,3413,JB's Tackle Depot...Ronson drive just off Dixon/401.  Decent selection of Sebile stuff...can't say offhand if he has koolies...# is 416.614.7222
626216,Oryx,2011-09-29 14:54:00,186," I was there a couple of weeks ago.  Great selection of everything BUT Sebiles.  They did have a couple of the soft plastic baits, but no hard baits."
626226,Harrison,2011-09-29 15:13:00,2202,"Great baits, could be tough to find up here. I do not carry the Koolies, but have the Magic Swimmers."
626236,adolson,2011-09-29 15:40:00,783,"I didn't know what this was, so I looked on Google Images.   If I ever catch something that looks like this, I'm done with fishing."
626239,Oryx,2011-09-29 15:44:00,186,"I saw them on WFN one night.  Jarrett Edwards Outdoors.  Has pretty cool action, so I thought I would try one."

626256,GBW,2011-09-29 16:22:00,8460,"well it is one of J.E.'s big sponsors...  I would hit up Tight Ligns at 401 and Brock and see what they have considering they are so close to you.  If not, see if Phil (Harrison) can get for you if he can track some down.  Give Phil the item # and he'll do his best.  He did for me with my musky sized jitterbug's!"
626278,Lunkerhunter,2011-09-29 17:10:00,455,gagnons defintely has them
