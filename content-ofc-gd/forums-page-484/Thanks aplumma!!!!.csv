625542,GBW,2011-09-27 22:55:00,8460,"Hey all.  So I get a call from my wife today to tell me ny new Compre DS rod is in and I'm happy as can be (no punn with the wasp post ).  I get home and I check the mail and there is a nice looking and working line counter reel in the mail box!  I get all giddy like a school girl and sure enough it's from aplumma (AKA Art)!  He told me he was going to send one of his old one's to me for free from another past post!  Talk about a nice thing he could do eh?!  So now I'm set for my BOQ trip with a new trolling combo (new rod and new to me LC reel) and a new drop shot rod as well!  Yeee ha, it's a good day...  Geoff"
625543,irishfield,2011-09-27 22:57:00,26272,Yah.. that Art fella is a pretty nice lad ! Must be the year he was born or sumptin...
625544,misfish,2011-09-27 22:59:00,29133,"You best be going to Lakair 2012, to thank him. Art and Joe are the salt of the earth.Ya I stole that from Roy,but it is so true.   Boys from the south,could pass as byes from the east here."
625562,mercman,2011-09-27 23:37:00,7054,Gotta love this place !!! I have to meet you some day Art.I have heard all kinds of wonderful things about you.Good on you for your generosity
625565,aplumma,2011-09-27 23:39:00,6896,Glad to get that reel in a place were it can be used correctly. I used it maybe three times and since trolling is not the way we fish it was more complicated than the job called for. Enjoy and post a picture of the first fish it catches.   Art
625568,GBW,2011-09-27 23:51:00,8460,"Oh, no pressure eh?  HAHAHA  Thanks again!"
625597,Roy,2011-09-28 00:41:00,13728,"Congrats on the winfall. Y'know, I heard that you were pretty handy at helping others out too, Geoff. Maybe that's how these things work, eh? Of course in Art's case we all know that he's just paying back for some unscrupulous deeds of the past.  Catch a big one on the Bay."
