614716,bigbuck,2011-08-23 13:58:00,2449,"Ron, good for you!!!! I will try to be there on the 19th. I grew up going to Cobourg beach and know the area well. Keep on fighting!!"
614726,thatleetboy,2011-08-23 14:31:00,143, I think this is a GREAT idea!  Congrats Ron for taking a stand!
614767,fishindevil,2011-08-23 16:03:00,6254,"awesome ron congrats,and thank-you !!! victory is yours man....cheers"
614842,206,2011-08-23 19:18:00,563,"  How did it go this time...and do we know where exactly we would be ""safe"" to fish down there?"
614844,dks,2011-08-23 19:27:00,36,"Thanks for fighting the good fight Ron. I'm curious as well, what did the ""burning debris"" turn out to be?"
614860,fishing n autograph,2011-08-23 20:42:00,2540,"It happens a lot in court. Usually what happens is that the charge is correct when the ticket is submitted to records and the bumbling dummy in records screws up the crown folder. The prosecution wouldn't change the charge, they would simply withdraw it"
614864,fishing n autograph,2011-08-23 20:53:00,2540,Congrats though! Dumb ticket anyway!
614902,Michael_Brown,2011-08-23 22:57:00,411," We pointed out this fact to the Justice of the Peace. It took three municipal police and three By-law commissionairs almost four hours to issue one ticket that had two mistakes. In defence of the police, it's not their issue and they did not want to be involved.  Hopefully the Town council sees the light and withdraws these by-laws."
614903,LeXXington,2011-08-23 23:02:00,1928,Great Going.. Thanks for standing up
614921,whitbyboatguy,2011-08-24 00:07:00,130,"Good work. I hate bullies (yes, hate) It is unlawful to interfere with people fishing....if it was pursued I don't think that it would have went over well. Not that it did. I don't think judges like having shenanigans going on.  I think I am going to drive to Coburg because I feel goooood."
614931,HTHM,2011-08-24 00:27:00,4082,"I have tried to find an article in the local news for this story, but haven't yet. Has anyone else found anything?"
614965,Ron,2011-08-24 02:41:00,1683,"It should be in Wednesday's paper... I think/   Cheers, Ron..."
614995,Harrison,2011-08-24 12:24:00,2202,"If I had a small fire and roasted a hot dog or two on the pier, would I be charged with fishing from the pier?"
615000,Aaron Shirley,2011-08-24 12:43:00,655,"Ron, Mike, very well done! Congratulations. Our rights as anglers have been trampled for too long. Good for you guys.  Ron, salmon derby is almost over. Let me know when you want to fish muskies"
615143,Ron,2011-08-24 17:32:00,1683,"Here is the link for the news paper. They just added it to their web site.  Angler drops another line at harbour following 'disappointing victory'  Special thanks to Pete Fisher for following this as it unfolded.  Cheers, Ron..."
615150,Handlebarz,2011-08-24 18:00:00,3790,Congrats Ronnie that picture is pricless
615164,irishfield,2011-08-24 18:40:00,26272,Man Ron.. you clean up pretty good !
615240,Terry,2011-08-24 22:18:00,14456, he does doesn't he  the fishing hat was a nice touch
615329,splashhopper,2011-08-25 02:35:00,2931,
615340,Ron,2011-08-25 03:39:00,1683,"Thanks for the support everyone. I look forward to seeing many of you at the Town council meeting in Sept. I will be sure to give ample notice once the date is secured.  As for fishing, the salmon season is soon to be upon us, there is not much for salmon in the Cobourg harbour. However the carp population is very high.  Cheers, Ron..."
615357,206,2011-08-25 11:49:00,563, So as long as you stand on the main pier(one you drive out on) you should be good....all other areas are already cover by town bylaws?
615985,monsterfish,2011-08-26 21:18:00,48,WHEN I GROW UP I WANNA BE RON REYNS!  Good on ya my friend!  Keep your hooks sharp!
625914,Ron,2011-09-28 19:36:00,1683,sorry need to bring forward
614455,Joey,2011-08-22 18:24:00,9122,Fantastic News Ron.  Well done in this matter.  I'm confused at to what debris you burned tho?  Their asses?
614457,Headhunter,2011-08-22 18:28:00,5703,"Thanks for your efforts Ron... funny though that they didn't value your or their time enough to kill the ticket well in advance of the court hearing. Maybe they didn't think you would show. And as others have mentioned, what were you burning and is this also going to get dropped? Someone gots some splaining to do... HH"
614466,Whopper,2011-08-22 18:40:00,2174, :lol:  Congrats Ron
614490,irishfield,2011-08-22 19:19:00,26272,"I imagine some smart individual on the prosecution side changed what Ron was charged with so it would immediately get thrown out when it went before the court, and so that they wouldn't have to put up any defence for the fishing charge... which also would avoid setting any precedant. In order to get a ruling on what Ron is trying to accomplish, he'll no doubt have to get another ticket.. and do it all again."
614491,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-22 19:20:00,10439,Well that seems like a complete cop out by the crown. If they weren't going to take it to court they should have let you know prior. I hope they are made to reimburse you for your time and expenses that you incurred because of their stupidity!!! May you hook into a freight train 'nook this afternoon Ron.
614494,Michael_Brown,2011-08-22 19:24:00,411,"Thanks Ron.  It was interesting to see the Justice of the Peace's reaction when we mentioned the seeking of associated costs with future charges being issued to any angler under this by-law and how the town is ""in our opinion"" violating the Fish and Wildlife Act by interfering with anglers lawfully fishing in the provincial waterway of the Cobourg Harbour.    Next up is the Town council and presenting this information to them and offer in good faith to remove these flawed by-laws pertaining to fishing the Cobourg Harbour.  Good job Ron for all you are doing to bring this to public awareness. It is not without personal expense and effort. Today alone was lost wages, gas and a $50.00 fee for a copy of the court transcript.  Before this is done I would like to see public support on this issue from our outdoor angling groups. The voice of Ontario anglers should not be left to one angler defending his rights. Organizations who provide letters of support before Sept 12, 2011 will have them included in our presentation to the Town Council. Anglers are voters and we should all support efforts to preserve our access to public waters.    Big thumbs up to you Ron.   We need an OFC award for you and others who lead by example."
614515,Rob,2011-08-22 20:35:00,467,Awesome work Ron!  Rob C
614530,Pigeontroller,2011-08-22 21:31:00,2793,Well done Ron!
614533,muskymatt,2011-08-22 21:40:00,2608,"great stuff Ron, good job!"
614534,Dutch,2011-08-22 21:42:00,831,"Good job, Ron.  Keep us posted on the Council appearance with respect to both time and date.  If someone has a contact at OFAH - this would be a great storyline for their magazine....."
614563,express168,2011-08-22 22:56:00,327," You nailed that right on the head Wayne, because that charge was never presented in court it was never addressed as being unenforcable. They truly never believed anyone would have taken this as far as Ron did.  Ron say the word when some financial assistance is needed and provide an address, $25-$50 a member here and we could really help out with some costs. As Larry Flint once said "" why do I have to keep going to jail to protect your freedoms""."
614572,ccmtcanada,2011-08-22 23:12:00,7971,Way to go Ron!!!!!  Congrats!  You are a real asset to this board and the fishing community as a whole.  Thank you for all you are doing.
614574,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-08-22 23:17:00,0,wow good news ron.  fisher-people are not criminals!
614580,Lokka,2011-08-22 23:45:00,32,Great job.. thou I am still wondering as to why they would even be allowed to change the charge of a ticket AFTER it's issued.. That's like issuing a speeding ticket to a car then charging them for J-Walking 2 weeks later because they saw you Littering. If Colbourg  wasn't so far from me.. i would be there on the 19th. You have my support and way to go on the win!
614584,bushart,2011-08-22 23:49:00,2628,Right On

614609,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-08-23 01:44:00,1107,I don't know if this has been suggested already but how about we have a OFC meet and greet at the cobourg harbour salmon should be staging soon  Good job Ron give em heck at the council meeting.
614611,Moosebunk,2011-08-23 01:49:00,3970,Fantastic Ron.  Great big 'ole balls to stick it out to that point and git 'er done!  Good show!

614662,outllaw,2011-08-23 11:11:00,1232,Ron and friends. thank you for standing tall. even though i am in southern ont. your actions have shown. fishermen and women have rights. you folks proved that.
614663,DT10Sam,2011-08-23 11:34:00,480,"Ron, let me know what I can do to help.  I wrote the date down and will make all efforts to attend at the town meeting.  You are certainly an inspiration to everyone.  Regards, Sam"
614257,Ron,2011-08-22 12:12:00,1683,"Well, today is my day in Court.  There is a lot of information which I can not fully bring out to the public at this point. I will keep everyone posted later on today once it is clarified or if it gets remanded.  Cheers, Ron..."
614259,Roy,2011-08-22 12:15:00,13728,"Good luck to you Ron. I'm sure you have your ducks in a row. If you need anything at all, just say the word.  My offer still stands."
614261,corvette1,2011-08-22 12:15:00,1765,good luck Ron
614262,Joey,2011-08-22 12:17:00,9122,Good luck Ron.  Can't wait to hear what happens.  Keep us informed if a jail break is needed

614301,cheaptackle,2011-08-22 13:17:00,849,"Best of Luck Ron!  Don't be surprised if they withdraw the charges or dismiss the case outright - by now they've had time to calculate the odds of getting a conviction aren't very good, or at least they bloody well should have!  Michael"
614304,fishnsled,2011-08-22 13:24:00,3520,Good luck Ron!! Thanks for all that you are doing!!
614387,DRIFTER_016,2011-08-22 15:41:00,10439,Good luck Ron!!! Lets hope we'll have an internet hosted celebration later today.

614398,SlowPoke,2011-08-22 16:03:00,2984,  Is this for the soliciting charge or the fishing thing? Good luck either way!! hehehe
614400,Terry,2011-08-22 16:05:00,14456,"well I think it was for using a fishing rod in public, in an area you can't do that"
614423,mercman,2011-08-22 17:01:00,7054,Do it To it Ron !!!   
614426,vinnimon,2011-08-22 17:10:00,2593,Good luck Ron

Yes -kindly keep us posted here   Every Success   Cheers Mate    Paul"
614440,Ron,2011-08-22 17:57:00,1683,"As expected, my ticket was quashed. They quashed the ticket just moments before we were to appear in court. Even though it was quashed, we still had our opportunity to speak before the Justice of the Peace to have on record, we will be seeking costs related to further charges in relation to fishing within Provincially regulated waters pertaining to the Cobourg Harbour.  We did not get an explanation for the reason of dropping the fine other than only what I can presume my notice to appear for trial the ticket was changed from ""Fishing on Pier"" to ""Burning of prohibited debris"". Yes, they changed the charge to ""Burning of prohibited debris""??????  I look forward to seeing the write up in Cobourg's news paper. Right now, I am on my way out the door to wet a line in the Cobourg Harbour!  Our next move on this By-Law is to address the Town Council. We have requested to speak on Sept 19 at 7PM. All are welcome to support us for this Presentation by showing up to the meeting.  I would like to thank Mike Brown for helping me with this case. The letter from the Ministry of Natural Resources was of great benefit as well. So if the Peterborough District MNR office is reading this, please give thanks to a certain person in particular for writing up such a well documented letter. Thanks to everyone for your support on this as well.   Cheers Ron........"
614442,Musky or Specks,2011-08-22 18:02:00,2710,Great news.
614444,fishnsled,2011-08-22 18:03:00,3520,"Congrats Ron!! If i get out of work at a decent time on the 19th, I'll see you there."
614445,Terry,2011-08-22 18:04:00,14456,well sounds somewhat positive  thanks for standing up for everyone
614446,Harrison,2011-08-22 18:08:00,2202,"Good for you Ron, when this is all done, can we go to Rice again?"
