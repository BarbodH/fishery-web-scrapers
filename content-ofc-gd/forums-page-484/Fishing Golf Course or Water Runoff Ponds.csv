625909,blaque,2011-09-28 19:23:00,2419,WWF..........Mac and Cheese.......Ok now im lost again
625910,GBW,2011-09-28 19:24:00,8460,get your golf clubs and your pocket fisherman and your set...

625943,woodenboater,2011-09-28 20:53:00,2277, I think we should try and convince the MNR to stock her pond with Aurora trout
626074,adolson,2011-09-29 02:23:00,783," That's where I've been putting all the ones I've caught, they're now naturally reproducing and the population is booming."
626105,HTHM,2011-09-29 03:05:00,4082,Oh dear....  This is a most entertaining thread.
625638,rhymobot,2011-09-28 01:37:00,174,"I was playing a course in Brampton and while waiting for my shot I had a look at the pond. Saw a few small largies cruising back and forth.  When the round was up I took the cart back to my car, picked up 2 retractables with some small lures and headed back to the 4th hole.  It was dark by now. Ten minutes of fishing and we were hitting largies and rockbass one after the other. However, they were all half pound or less. I guess they never seen lures before.   So... do you think all golf course ponds and those water runoff ponds in the middle of subdivisions are stocked with bass and maybe cats? They're there to regulate the water no?"
625640,ChrisK,2011-09-28 01:40:00,2772,I know of a couple here in London that are chalked full of goldfish...
625642,rhymobot,2011-09-28 01:47:00,174, Nice. There's one in brampton like that too.
625643,GoneFishin,2011-09-28 01:47:00,349,My buddy got his pb bass out of a little irrigation pond on a golf course he worked on. When the course got closed they donated all the fish they could catch to a local fish hatchery. There were tons.
625644,timmeh,2011-09-28 01:49:00,609,You never know what you may find in those stormwater ponds. They are for water management and are not stocked legally. But illegal dumping of fish happens for sure.
625647,splashhopper,2011-09-28 01:51:00,2931,I used to play in Huron County....the course I played had two ponds LOADED with LM bass...
625650,Rizzo,2011-09-28 01:54:00,4754,"I used to fish on the golf course at Centennial hill in Etobicoke, I think it was around the 3rd hole or so. Pond was full of bass. In Florida and Myrtle Beach I always have a retractable rod with me while golfing. If I don't catch at least a 3 pounder my golf day was unsuccessful!"
625655,GBW,2011-09-28 02:03:00,8460,"courses that have tour events DO stock the ponds.  Angus Glen stocked a few ponds in the past (2007) because Tiger, Mark O'M, Davis Love III and a few others love to bass fish in the 'down time' for the week they are there at the event.  Others that are smaller, not so much.  But if a river runs through it, you never know..."
625691,northernpike56,2011-09-28 03:53:00,717,"dont pass up any pond! As you said, there are usaully tons of fish that have never seen a lure before. As for what might be lurking around in the ponds, you might have some bass, sunfish, rock bass, carp, bullhads, etc swimming around"
625711,ehg,2011-09-28 11:42:00,2666,About 5-6 yrs. ago there was a thread on here about fishing these areas. There seemed to  be largies all over the place in stormwater drain off ponds. These folks used Google maps to find areas and found bass in them. For some reason threads were locked and a website was formed just dedicated to fishing urban storm run off sites. Good luck with trying this...
625714,Rizzo,2011-09-28 11:46:00,4754, All it takes is one person bringing home a few largies in their livewell and setting them free. I've got a few ponds up here that have all kinds of fish in them
625764,adolson,2011-09-28 13:35:00,783,"Hmm, there's a pond on my mother-in-law's property... No golf course, mind you, but maybe I should cast a line in there and see what happens."
625781,scugpg,2011-09-28 14:02:00,1373,I've always wondered about those ponds in the new subdivisions and golf courses. Most you are not allowed to fish though. Definitely do C&R there as the runoff and fertilizer would be highly concentrated!
625838,MJL,2011-09-28 16:09:00,2427,One of my friends was banned from a golf course for a year for fishing one of the ponds
625841,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 16:16:00,130, Yep. I can see stopping on the fairway to fish a pond setting off the course marshal's ape-shoot button with the dial turned to 10.  I did it when I was a kid and the golfers would go bananas (rightfully so).
625845,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 16:23:00,130,   The ponds were fully of trophy sized musky! Those were the days!
625848,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 16:33:00,130, ....whatever.
625852,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 16:43:00,130," yeah....you missed the part where I thought I thought you were being sarcastic (""I don't believe you"", I thought it was funny) and was continuing your sarcasm. If you really must know it was bass and carp in a river that got me fishing the courses.  Anyways I changed the quote to ""whatever"" just before you posted in an attempt to head off bad intentions. So one last ""....whatever"" from me."
625853,capt bruce,2011-09-28 16:44:00,820,"Hey Sinclair will you and GBW let me join your ""GANG"" lmao .... where do these guys come from ... Oh ya WHITBY , I told GBW it allways smells in Whitby"
625855,GBW,2011-09-28 16:46:00,8460,Sure Capt!      I never knew I had a 'gang' before... Now you know why I DON'T live there...
625863,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 17:07:00,130," I guess ""...whatever"" won't sit  If it was that one thread alone I would have said nothing and let it go as low end humor among those on the inside.  You started the tone with the ""I don't believe you statement"" I gave you the benefit of the doubt and took it as a humorous statement? If you are being sarcastically humorous am I not allowed to continue in the same manner?  I now take it your first post ""I don't believe you"" was not a friendly or humorous one and only done to pick a fight or start an argument. Correct?"

625885,otter649,2011-09-28 17:59:00,118,  Going back a few years when The Canadian Open was played in september at Glen Abbey - I remember a tv clip showing Greg Norman & his group looking at salmon attempting to swim up through the 16 mile creek swallower parts......
