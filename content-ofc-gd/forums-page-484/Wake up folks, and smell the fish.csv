589614,Ron,2011-06-03 22:21:00,1683,"A very well written article by Terry Curtis in regards to no fishing in the Town of Cobourg.  I hope everyone has July 1st open on their calendar, I know where I am fishing that day. Perhaps send him an email yourself as well in support of this.     The whole article is right here: Wake up folks, and smell the fish  Cheers, Ron..."
