625919,Ron,2011-09-28 19:37:00,1683,"There will be an update on this in regards to the by laws. The Town of Cobourg has been sent notice and now it can be public information.   Today is my day in court. (charged for fishing in the Cobourg harbor) *updated* I WON  Ron at it Again new ticket  I fought the Law and ... no fishing by-law  Wake up folks, and smell the fish Article in Cobourg News paper by Terry Curtis"
625926,Ron,2011-09-28 20:06:00,1683,"Hello everyone,  A much deserved update in regards to ""no fishing"" in the Cobourg Harbour.  With a request letter I sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources, they in turn sent me a truly valuable document to verify I was indeed, legal to fish the Cobourg Harbour according to their by-laws. Since my initial ticket, this document was being held by myself as evidence until required in court.  Since my first ticket was quashed,you can read the transcript here (hmm, don't know how to link files on line.) I did not have the opportunity to submit to the Crown so i held onto this for a later date.  As I work many days close to the harbour, I was speaking with one of my suppliers at the harbour parking lot and was more or less challenged by the by-law enforcement to fish the harbour again... So I did! This gave me my second ticket. I am still waiting for the court date for this ticket.  Since this ticket, I have sent a copy of the letter (don't know how to link files on line) I obtained from the MNR to the Cobourg Chief of Police. I have since spoken with the Chief and they have agreed to no longer lay any charges pertaining to fishing in the Cobourg harbour.  The Town of Cobourg by-law enforcement however were not so obliging... at first... I hand delivered the letter to the town and made it very clear I will be charging the town for harassment if they continue issuing tickets. Her reply - We are not backing down, you do what you have to do Ron. *end of discussion*. About 2 hours later, I receive a phone call, the town are in agreement, they will no longer issue tickets for fishing in the harbour.  In fact, they want to meet with myself and Mike to further discuss what can be done to solve our fishing issue in the Cobourg Harbour."
625927,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-09-28 20:08:00,0,well done!
625928,misfish,2011-09-28 20:09:00,29133, Now thats how all towns and cities should work.Not one sided. Well done Ron.
625929,Terry,2011-09-28 20:11:00,14456,"you are a good man to keep this fight going, we all own you a big thanks"
625931,whitbyboatguy,2011-09-28 20:18:00,130,your the man Ron!  What was the gist of the letter that hit home with the chief? Is the link for the file an URL or do you need someplace on the web to post it?
625934,woodenboater,2011-09-28 20:26:00,2277,Terrific grunt work and determination to do the right thing Ron !  Paid off eventually and hopefully the town has learned something from this and that other municipalities take heed. I'm heartened to hear the town wants to work with you to solve the fishing situation and the town can only benefit from this as far as I'm concerned.  Kudos !
625935,irishfield,2011-09-28 20:27:00,26272,Great stuff Ron... now be sure to get the new ticket dismissed officially in court (ie - the muncipality has no constitution capacity to assess power over fishing... that is under the jurisdiction of the province) so there is precedent for all other towns that do this !
625937,johnnyb,2011-09-28 20:42:00,3413,WOW!!! THAT'S AWESOME!!! You're a hero Ron....well done!!
625939,Hud,2011-09-28 20:46:00,140,good on ya man for not backing down

625942,206,2011-09-28 20:52:00,563,"Thanks for the update....curious as to what they wanna chat to you about?  I am still not clear on where you could actually stand to fish legally, or does this mean you could drop a line anywhere down there?"
625944,Handlebarz,2011-09-28 20:57:00,3790,"In fact, they want to meet with myself and Mike to further discuss what can be done to solve our fishing issue in the Cobourg Harbour.  WTH I have not even been down to the Harbour before how did I get involved in this   Oh well I guess I can make a fishing trip.  Great work Ron so is this the place for the next OFC G2G?"
625972,JoshS,2011-09-28 22:31:00,729,Thanks Ron!! I've been kicked out of the harbour before wondering what the hell the reason for that was. Thanks for putting in the work for everyone!

626157,DT10Sam,2011-09-29 11:29:00,480,"The whole fishing community thanks you Ron for standing up to what is right and not letting the wrong bylaws run you off. Good on you Ron.  Regards, Sam"
