588746,Headhunter,2011-06-01 12:49:00,5703,"You're fighting the good fight here Ron. On behalf of myself and my kids, I thank you! DO I see an OFC GTG in Cobourg in the near future? HH"
588780,tonyb,2011-06-01 14:20:00,1637,"Hats off to you Ron, looking forward to seeing how this one ends up.   Trying not to hi-jack...but of course your situation in Coburg reminded me of the similar 'no fishing by-law' in Oakville that Aaron mentions as well.   Here is the Oakville sign posted in the park on lower Bronte Creek.    Aaron, (and others interested) I looked into the situation in Oakville for Bronte Creek and it is a different by-law that they use.  It is different, yet the same end result as Ron's situation, no shore fishing access for anyone.  Oakville maybe has more money to use for their lawyers and by-law creators.  They were able to legally ban FISHING from shore in the park lands from Rebecca St south to Lakeshore Rd.  It baffles me that they can discriminate any one single activity from park land and in this case, that activity is fishing.  How can this be??!  The answer is found in Section 10.1 of the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act ( F&W Conservation Act Link ) - They can specifically rule out fishing or hunting using the TRESSPASS TO PROPERTY ACT  Trespassing  10.(1) A person shall not, (a) enter premises in contravention of the Trespass to Property Act for the purpose of hunting or fishing;  (b ) enter premises in contravention of the Trespass to Property Act in possession of a firearm, fishing rod or other hunting or fishing device;  (c ) engage in hunting or fishing in contravention of the Trespass to Property Act;  (d) fail to leave premises in contravention of the Trespass to Property Act, if the person was on the premises for the purpose of hunting or fishing; or  (e) fail to leave premises in contravention of the Trespass to Property Act, if the person was on the premises in possession of a firearm, fishing rod or other hunting or fishing device.  So there you have it...there are laws written in Ontario to specifically discriminate against anglers and hunters.  Will be keeping an eye on this thread Ron, kudos to you!"
589154,Michael_Brown,2011-06-02 12:40:00,411,"""enter premises in contravention of the Trespass to Property Act for the purpose of hunting or fishing;""  The enter premises section seems to indicate the land is not pubic but private. I would look into who owns the lands this is posted on and if it is indeed public land than it would be infringing on your rights as a citizen and angler.  Ron we need to go for a coffee or evening walleye fish, before your big excursion north. I will bring some paperwork for your review."

589382,crossover,2011-06-03 04:42:00,172,"I have a feeling the city of Oakville passed that by-law due to the amount of garbage left behind by fishermen. Doesn't make it right, but people need to pick up their crap."
589393,bigugli,2011-06-03 10:39:00,6138,"If that be the case....?  Considering the amount of crap floating arounf yacht clubs and marinas, Boats should be banned from tying up in public marinas. There are enough wealthy slobs who still dump their garbage over the side."

The by-law is still on the books and until we have signs taken down and by-laws removed, I would suggest we continue moving forward. Actions speak louder than words and I'm looking forward to the day when families can enjoy fishing in Cobourg Harbour if they want."

Just let me know where to send the cash.   Paul"
586700,danc,2011-05-26 01:51:00,4677,Add me to the list of spiritual and financial supporters of your cause Ron. You're tireless fight for fishing rights is amazing. I'm happy to call you a friend.

586826,Michael_Brown,2011-05-26 13:54:00,411,   Ron would be the bear and Cobourg council should quash these by-laws before they damage their angling based tourism and public image. A lot of voters fish.
586828,GBW,2011-05-26 13:56:00,8460,"Great idea!  How would one do that though?  *hint, help Ron with the details so he can do it*"
586860,Aaron Shirley,2011-05-26 15:16:00,655,"Ron, you're such a rebel! lol  I think you have the support of many on this one, including myself. Our rights as anglers have been slowly eroding in Ontario, despite the fact we have legislation implemented by past Premiere Mike Harris with the Fishing and Hunting Heritage Act. This act was supposed to support our rights to fish and hunt. Obviously, there are exceptions for obvious reasons, like fish and wildlife sanctuaries, certain parks and recreation areas etc.  Your case does not appear to be one of those reasonable exceptions and opens up a big can of worms. Exactly what you wanted, and for good reason. It's a ballsy move on your part, but you are an activist fighting for a good cause.  In my area, the Town of Oakville has done something similar to the old ""social sanctuary"" that was lifted a few years ago. As soon as the OMNR removed the sanctuary from Bronte Creek from Hwy 2 to Rebecca St., the Town of Oakville put in a new by-law to ban fishing in that stretch of Bronte Creek. As far as I am concerned, this may actually be illegal by Provincial law - The Fishing and Hunting Heritage Act? As Michael has noted, this is at the very least discrimination to one user group, as people may do anything they wish on this land but fish. It sounds like your case Ron is very similar to the Bronte Creek issue with the Town of Oakville and anglers.  Your case can be argued on many levels. First, there was a swath of enforcement reading by-laws just to try and come up with something to charge you. This gives you an argument off the hop. Secondly, it doesn't sound like there were any signs posted about a fish and wildlife refuge on protected land. Another argument. Third, their by-law may conflict with Provincial legislation designed to protect angler's and hunter's rights. I thought only the Provincial or Federal Government could legislate a fish and wildlife refuge? I don't know the answer to this, but something to look into to determine the legitimacy of the by-law you were charged with. Fourth, public scrutiny and outrage to allow fishing on the pier, or at least a compromise for the East pier may be possible if enough people send e-mails to the right authorities. The more people that send e-mails to town council on this matter, the more possible it will be to have your court case end favorable for you... and ultimately, for anglers. If anyone knows the proper e-mail to send to the township of Cobourg, lease post it here.  There is no good reason to ban fishing on the piers that I can think of in your case. Unfortunately, your scenario is becoming more prevalent across Ontario, just like Bronte Creek, and countless other examples. Shore access spots are disappearing quickly around my area and over our Province. This concerns me a great deal when piers, pond and creek shore access is taken away or banned from fishing. Apart from discrimination, kids will not have anywhere to begin fishing from shore if this continues. I started fishing at the age of 9, riding my bike with a rod over the handle bars to fish the very areas that are being slowly stripped away from us and our kids.  Good luck Ron!  As a side note:  We have a Provincial election coming up this fall people!!! This election is the time to act and put our great pastime in the limelight with the party leaders. Public pressure on political leaders will work if enough of us act, especially during an election campaign. I tried to get people here to see this over late winter, but I realize I was going about it the wrong way. An ""unorganized write a letter and mail it to party leaders before this fall election"" will not realistically gain much support. After watching the success of openmedia.ca simple webpage with a form type petition to email political leaders to fight for the internet, the light bulb went off. This can be a simple and easy way to send our Provincial leaders a message during their campaign and put fishing rights for Ontarians in the spotlight. Anybody want to help me with this? Ron? I know of a cheap way to host a webpage. I can write a letter in conjunction with some of you. I don't know where to start for the form aspect of the webpage and email address for all party leaders.  Sorry Ron, didn't mean to hijack your thread. This type of thing has been really bothering me for quite some time now, and I want to do something about it. I admire your tenacity and wish you luck with your court case. I'll send you a PM.  Aaron"
586864,NBR,2011-05-26 15:26:00,163,While I agree with you in principle there might be cause for not allowing fishing from marina property. If your lawyers and people are as prone to suits as they are here in the U.S.the marina could be put in financial duress if someone should fall from their property and suffer loss of life or serious injury. If it was my marina in the states I would be very hesitant to allow bank or pier fishing. Fishing from a boat would be a different matter.
586869,Sis,2011-05-26 15:46:00,24,"I am so proud to be able to call you my friend!! I'd say don't back down, but already know that you won't. People like you who have the guts to stand up for what they believe in make the world a better place! Love ya Ron!!!"
586871,Homer Is King,2011-05-26 15:54:00,305,"Good job Ron, way to dig in your heels!  To clarify, (correct me if I'm wrong Ron):  Ron's not fighting to be allowed to fish in the marina. There is a by-law that clearly states that you can not. It lists several areas in the Cobourg Harbour where fishing is not allowed. Ron was fishing in an area the is not listed in the by-law, the east pier. People have been chased off of this spot and not allowed to fish. Ron's arguing that it is not part of the by-law and people should be allowed to fish there.  Google Map of Cobourg Pier"

587031,Stoty,2011-05-26 23:21:00,2910,"Wow, I had this exact same thing happen to me last spring! I know exactly who the old (grumpy) fart is that comes storming out, pretending he owns the city!  He came out and literally swore at my buddy and I ""Hey.... balh, blah, blah, you're not allowed to fish in the harbour.""  We (pretty bluntly) said we could, and to leave us alone. He then threatened the cops on us, to which we also replied to feel free and go call. (He never did).  But he then proceeded to go to the launch and LOCK it, so we couldn't get out.  We then proceeded into the office, and confronted this old fart, to which he crumbled like a soda cracker, and just said that we owed the launch fee, LOL.  GOOD JOB RON.... I will def be fishing there in the very near future, with a big    on my face!"
587041,Stoty,2011-05-26 23:42:00,2910," No, I believe that is the east pier. See the above map of the Cobourg Marina."

587493,16sailor,2011-05-28 13:12:00,38,Way to go Ron I too grew up in Cobourg and fished the harbor all the time while growing up and still live in the area now with my daughter growing up I want to be able to take her out for a fish and the harbour is a perfect for her Ron when is your day in court My daughter and i will be there with fishing poles in hand at the court house in support any one else want to join us on that day just friendly rally in support Stand and talk about fishing while Ron has his day in court the more the better hopefully the point will get across.
587507,otter649,2011-05-28 14:46:00,118,The Outdoor Journal (Fishing Canada) on The Fan 590 Radio (28) this morning mentioned this dispute & the newspaper article with support for Ron.....
587513,lew,2011-05-28 15:29:00,12766,Your doing a great thing here Ron and it's gonne be very interesting to see how it plays out.
587520,Nipfisher,2011-05-28 16:18:00,2449,Good job Ron. The North Bay marina also has no fishing by-law. There are many anglers who fish from the peir into the marina without ever getting into trouble. I beleive North Bay is just stopping people from trolling and casting inside the marina. My question is.....what about ice-fishing? It seems like you can't ice fish in North Bay marina...can you drill a hole and ice fish in the coburg marina during the winter?
587528,Stoty,2011-05-28 17:07:00,2910,Funny you ask that.... because there was a picture in the Cobourg paper over the winter with a guy that had a portable hut setup and was ice fishing in the middle of the harbour...they chased him out as well. Even though it appears as though he wasn't doing a thing wrong!
588637,Ron,2011-06-01 01:02:00,1683,"Thanks everyone for your support and more importantly, your opinions, good or bad. Seriously, the bad opinions are well received, just the same. A few items that need to be clarified for those of you who do not know the area.  The fine I was issued, is in reference to:  Consolidated Parks By-law number 064-2010  A By-law to regulate, protect and govern the use of parks, public open spaces in the Town of Cobourg.  Protection of Wildlife 8. While in a park, no person shall:  (1) Kill, attempt to kill, trap, hunt, pursue or in any manner disturb any animal, bird, waterfowl, FISH, worms or any other wildlife, provided that provision shall not apply to any person, fishing in Provincially or Federally legislated waters unless otherwise posted;  Subsequently, if you read the article posted in our local News paper (link here), you can take judgment to your own opinion. As I posted above on this thread, the By-law 79-91, clearly shows where you are NOT allowed to fish. The signs posted on the hand rails, Transformer stations, clearly show this as well. For those of you who have any doubt where I was fishing, I was on the EAST PIER. Clearly the EAST PIER is NOT listed in BY-law 79-91. That is the reason why they did not charge me under this by-law. There is no doubt the Cobourg Harbour is Provincially or Federally legislated waters. I have documents on their way to prove this. I have spoken with several levels of Goverment, to name a few, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Service Ontario, Ministry of Natural Resources, Special Lands and Waters Assessment Unit.  I will be attending the next council meeting to speak in regards to the By-laws.  This has drawn much attention in the media. I have had a couple of radio talk shows contact me and I have also had 2 other News Papers contact me as well.  To be clear to everyone, There is no By-law restricting me from fishing where I was. They have charged me for hunting/trapping/ killing/ attemping to kill a fish. The sergeant would not agree the harbour was Provincially or Federally legislated waters. The sergeant also told me the New By-law (Consolidated Parks By-law number 064-2010) over rode the By-law 79-91 as it was a newer By-law.  2 of the responding Police Officers, questioned the act of the By-law, in fact, 1 Constable refused to issue the ticket as he was too embarrassed to have his name affiliated to the charge.  Another point worth noting:  The by-law they charged me under, 064-2010 section 8.1, if I do not take this to trial, they can charge everyone who fishes any lake or stream, body of water in the Town of Cobourg. This could potentially put an end to fishing for trout or any other species for that matter, in Cobourg.  Once again, I am not concerned for myself, I am pretty sure people will vouch for me when I say I fish all over Ontario, I do not need to fish in a Harbour and be a rebellion against the Law. When you see kids getting bullied by adults, by-law enforcement officers and Police officers, telling them they can not fish in the Harbour, someone needs to protect these rights for the kids that enjoy fishing. They should not have to feel like a criminal for enjoying the Natural Resources.  Cheers, Ron..."
588647,Grimace,2011-06-01 01:22:00,2020,Good on ya.  They seem to be trying to make a square out of a circle here.  Good luck.
588728,Billy Bob,2011-06-01 11:29:00,5865,"Good Job Ron.......I just hope they don't write another stupid By-Law to include the area you were fishing in to patch the loop holes in their own laws, but instead see the light and encourage kids to go FISHING as you are trying to do.  If you need some Rednecks for a protest I'm sure I could round up a posse of them....  Bob"
586354,dave524,2011-05-25 01:06:00,4508,"My 2 cents FWIW, it appears there is not a problem with being able to fish the actual water as you were not charged while in a boat. This along with the wording of the posted text seems to indicate that they are prohibiting an activity while on these piers, docks and other structures, which they are probably within their right to do so. I really don't see it as any different than they say prohibiting skateboarding and rollerblading on the pier or swimming and diving off the pier. It has nothing really to do with the water but your physical location while fishing. sorry"
586361,misfish,2011-05-25 01:11:00,29133," Wayne,any time I have been there,which has been a few times,theres always been kids fishing there. The by-law is a joke.You of all, should know this.  I went through the same as Ron here in the Barrie marina years ago. You cant fish here . I was in a canoe. I said call a cop,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Oh they did and he showed up. Asked to see my fishing lic.Showed it to him, he said ,have a nice day. This whole thing about owning water on a main body of water is a joke. Oh did I say that again?

Is there something in that city hall's drinking water?  Would'nt Rick Mercer have a beaut rant on this craziness
586375,Michael_Brown,2011-05-25 01:45:00,411,"Reading the posting it is the ""As deemed advisable"" section that annoys me.  BY WHO?  I will state this again they are not banning any other user group from accessing this area. By ONLY banning fishing they are selectively discriminating against anglers and yes I am offended.  The town allows and has allowed large groups of anglers to fish daily, the rivers and shorelines in Cobourg. They enjoy the monetary benefits of the tourism this angling activity brings to the community. They are selectively choosing to implement a by-law when they desire, which also shows discrimination against a person. (Ron) I will personally attest to having fished Factory creek and the park areas numerous times in full view of all enforcement agencies and have never been questioned or had this by-law mentioned. Anyone else?  http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/resources/Guides/GuideHRcode2/pdf  Someone please start a e-petition that we can sign to show support of this issue. It will go a long way to support a claim of group discrimination.  This is wrong and needs corrected. Ron will need more that a few emails, so lets all help out with our support.  Besides, I have fished with Ron and he wasn't harming any fish.(possibly worms  )"
586403,tilly,2011-05-25 03:02:00,32,"Hey Ron, I know this might seem absurd, but you need to contact your local municipal representative about this. See where they stand; your argument seems logical and right, but lots of people wear blinders when it comes to small issues like this...  And also remember (from my limited knowledge of the Ontario court system) that even if you are found guilty in your local court, you can always try to appeal.  Use legal-aid if needed."
586410,thalweg,2011-05-25 03:23:00,112, I've walked rivers numerous occasions and yes find the occasional jig...but no where near as common or dangerous as large crank baits etc in the boats.  So in that light...I don't believe you.

585864,Terry,2011-05-23 17:08:00,14456, boat houses and docks are considered private property in Ontario so unless it's an emergency it would be illegal to tie up to it
585952,206,2011-05-23 22:18:00,563,I heard this unfold on the scanner...Police were contacting the coast gaurd as well to see if they could remove you! LOL
585975,Billy Bob,2011-05-23 23:24:00,5865, LOCK HIM UP....LOL...
585981,Michael_Brown,2011-05-23 23:48:00,411,"The part of this By-Law that is most disturbing is that the land around the harbour is a municipal park. The Marina in fact only controls a portion of the harbour yet they are trying to ban fishing in the entire area. You are allowed to walk your dog, fly your kite, sit and drink a coffee or anything else you feel like except fishing.  dis·crim·i·na·tion [ di skrìmmə náysh'n ]  Definition:  1. treating people differently through prejudice: unfair treatment of one person or group, usually because of prejudice about race, ethnicity, age, religion, or gender  If the land was off limits for all user groups than possible it could be considered fair. I have not seen Ron's tax statement but I assume he pays his share of municipal tax and therefore should be considered a member of the group that control the property. It should also be noted that the marina owner is also a council member.  These types of by-law limit access to angling for everyone and should always be questioned or if allowed will continue to grow.  Why can't the anglers of Cobourg fish on public land in public water?  Good for you Ron. I got your back."
585988,irishfield,2011-05-24 00:14:00,26272,"It's like free use of a tax payer funded and designed dog park, yet having to pay to launch your boat in the same park. Me Son's working on that one here..."
586050,Handlebarz,2011-05-24 02:23:00,3790,Well no update from Ronnie where do we send the bail money to???
586089,thalweg,2011-05-24 05:21:00,112,"I personally hate fishing area restrictions. If we don't do something about it, soon more areas will be pay to play or no play at all. Some of my favourite sections of steel head waters continue to get encroached on by private land owners. I would really love to see stream and fishing area access rights.  That said, it never pays to change a law by breaking one.  There are other ways to get the law reviewed...via responsible means. Go to city council meetings and be heard. Your comments will at least be documented and you might get support from the Councillors.   Find out why they applied the law; while its unlikely..they may have a good reason for it. If you can point out the silliness of the bylaw in a logical way you'll have a high probability of changing it.  As for marina no fishing.  I have several friends with large motor and sail boats and they pick out more treble hooks and lures from their ropes and sails and deck wood then we likely have in our tackle boxes. In fact, one of their young daughters had to go to hospital to get a huge treble hook dislodged from her foot while running down the deck. The zara spook...was lodged on mooring rope. She was running...lets just say...she stopped dead in her tracks.  I fully and completely support no fishing in marina mooring areas.  Good luck"
586092,Terry,2011-05-24 09:06:00,14456, funny I say close all the rivers to fishing I know property owners who find hooks everywhere but keep the marinas open to fishing  100% self serving as was your statement don't take away my fishing but screw you and your fishing
586096,Carp,2011-05-24 10:24:00,1488,Good job Ron. Keep up the fight !!!
586137,torco,2011-05-24 14:29:00,656,"Good on your Ron. The NWPA has been under pressure recently and by exercising your rights under it you have shown law-makers and the general public that it is still relevant and should be respected.  Keep your eyes peeled on Parliament in the coming months and years as this one act that is the cross-hairs to be ""updated"". I could be wrong but it may have already been altered in the last parliament under the guise of stimulus."
586140,Squid,2011-05-24 14:38:00,1656,
586320,Ron,2011-05-25 00:13:00,1683,"Just an update, If you know any good lawyers, let me know. They finally gave me a ticket. Lets just say, if you fish in any Park in Cobourg, you are liable to get a ticket. This would include fishing for Rainbow trout, Salmon, Carp, the list goes on. So, once again, if you don't think this is worth fighting for, please feel free to let me know.  This is how the By-law is written:  Consolidated Parks By-law number 064-2010  A By-law to regulate, protect and govern the use of parks, public open spaces in the Town of Cobourg.  Protection of Wildlife 8. While in a park, no person shall:  (1) Kill, attempt to kill, trap, hunt, pursue or in any manner disturb any animal, bird, waterfowl, FISH, worms or any other wildlife, provided that provision shall not apply to any person, fishing in Provincially or Federally legislated waters unless otherwise posted;   Like I said, if you think this is not worth fighting for, I guess you are not interested in fishing for any of the migratory species that come up the rivers in the town of Cobourg. This will limit your fishing to the mouth of the river, oh wait, the town owns that too as that is considered Public open spaces.   Not so Cheery,  Ron..."
586321,irishfield,2011-05-25 00:17:00,26272,But you were fishing in Provincially legislated waters.. NO??  I'm in for the first $100 of the lawyers bill.. who's next?
586329,Daplumma,2011-05-25 00:26:00,1961,I'll go for the second hun.Cant help with a good lawyer...no such thing.Sorry Marty. Joe
586331,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-25 00:29:00,0,"   provision shall not apply to any person, fishing in Provincially or Federally legislated waters unless otherwise posted;    As Wayne said. You fall into this catagory unless I read it wrong.   Wouldn't surprise me. Unless it's posted somewhere that you can't fish.   I'm in for a brown one. Pretty cheap Lawyer so far eh..."
586332,Roy,2011-05-25 00:29:00,13728,"It's insane, I'll do the third fourth hundred."
586334,HTHM,2011-05-25 00:32:00,4082,Is this something a membership in the OFHA would help with? This is an honest question and not meant to open up a debate on the relative merits of the organization.
586339,Ron,2011-05-25 00:38:00,1683,"  Yes I was, in fact I was fishing in an area where there is no signage stating you can not fish as the by-law also mentions.    The above image, as of May 24th, was posted in the bulletin board at the Cobourg Marina. It clearly states where you are and are not allowed to fish.  I was fishing on the East Pier. There is no mention of the East Pier on by-law 97-91.  This will all be the local paper tomorrow.  Did I mention it took 3 Commissioners and 4 Cobourg Police Officers, including the staff sergeant to finally give me a ticket? (How embarrassing).  I cannot say any more until I speak with a lawyer and get a court date."
586344,206,2011-05-25 00:45:00,563,So the fine was only cause you returned to fish on shore? You were fine in the boat?  I'm sure we could flood the harbor with small fishing boats to give support for your cause!
586347,irishfield,2011-05-25 00:51:00,26272," So not only were you fishing.... you were using live ""bait""! LMAO"
586348,misfish,2011-05-25 00:51:00,29133,"After reading that note,I  have to say,GO GETEM RON.  Wayne,,pay up."
586351,irishfield,2011-05-25 01:01:00,26272,"A heads up for you Ron... with my Town Councillor son looking over my shoulder... when the DFO handed the pier over to the Town... the water ""lease"" would have gone with it which gives the town the right to control any activity in their ""water lot"", just like many posted Marinas that least crown land(water), similar to fly in fishing camps have lease permits for the land. Crown land or not.... you can be charged with tresspassing if you refuse to leave their leasehold camp.  Penetang's town pier has always been posted No Fishing from pier... and council has to amend the bylaw for the day of the kids fishing derby and bag the signs."
586352,206,2011-05-25 01:02:00,563,"Sorry, and the ""Centre Pier"" is the main part you can drive your car out on?"
586353,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-25 01:04:00,0,  7 for 7 is a good morning on lake O....
585679,Ron,2011-05-23 01:43:00,1683,"I won!  For quite some time now, the town of Cobourg has had a By-law stating you can not fish in the Cobourg Harbour. I never did really know the whole portion of the By-law but I was willing to challenge it.  This morning I decided to launch my boat and start fishing around in the harbour, there are many large Pike and the same many large Carp. I eventually approached the marina office where a guy came out demanding I stop fishing as there is no fishing allowed in the harbour. I told him to call the cops as I was within in my legal right to fish anywhere I want as this is navigable waters and they don't own the water.  It took a while for the officers to show up but eventually they did, after all, I am certain they had better things to do than try to enforce a By-law. The cop politley asked me to stop fishing as there is a no fishing by-law. I replied, ""I'm sorry but you will have to give me a ticket as it is not only a privilege but also my right to fish in federal waters.""  ""Do you really want to go this route?"" he asked. ""Yes I do"" I replied. He asks me for my fishing license and then another form of ID. He goes back to the cruiser and about 10 minutes later he hands me back my ID. I ask him ""Where is my fine?"" ""Not just yet, this is still under investigation"" he replies.  After about 45 minutes, he goes to leave and I ask him, ""Where is my ticket?"" ""At this point in time I will not issue a ticket for fishing as this is still under investigation. You know, there are better ways to dispute a By-law"". ""This is the only way I know how to get attention"" I says back!  I was told I was free to fish for the rest of the day as the Police can't stop me. I finally got a copy of the Fishing By-law within the Town of Cobourg. Basically it states you can not fish the center pier, nor can you fish the North wall in the general posted areas between Third St and Division St.  They can not stop a person from fishing in a boat!  Tomorrow morning I will be fishing on shore in the harbour, hoping they try to give me a ticket.  I am not looking to see how far I can push this issue. I am doing this because there are many kids in this town who would enjoy fishing off the pier. It doesn't matter if they catch fish or not, it gives them a chance to enjoy the resources we have in town. There were 4 kids fishing this morning and they had fish stories from the day before about the size of some of the BIG Pike in here. ""It broke my line!"" he exclaimed.  Bottom line is, there really is some big Pike in this harbour, I had 1 on but lost, plus I had 7 or 8 other follows. I have enjoyed Carp fishing down here the past year as well.  Cheers, Ron..."
585681,limeyangler,2011-05-23 01:46:00,5204,Interesting story Ron....good on ya for sticking to your guns.
585684,Rod Caster,2011-05-23 01:50:00,5784,Do what's right. Well done.
585686,irishfield,2011-05-23 01:52:00,26272,"So you're fishing off the pier tomorrow, correct?"
585690,Ron,2011-05-23 01:54:00,1683,Yes sir.  Anyone care to join me?
585693,Joey,2011-05-23 01:56:00,9122,"Good for you Ron.  Some laws need to be challenged when they don't make sense.  If you get thrown in the hoosgow, give us a holler, I'm sure OFC would pool up your bail in a few minutes"
585695,irishfield,2011-05-23 01:58:00,26272,Yah... we can open a Paypal account pretty quickly Joey !!
585699,Spiel,2011-05-23 02:02:00,9065,"I'd be standing right beside Ron, fishing rod in hand if I could."
585700,Ron,2011-05-23 02:08:00,1683,"Geesh Spiel,  I wished I had read my emails first, I could have used that helpful information in regards ""How not to apologize to a Police Officer"".  Perhaps I would have gotten the ticket I had asked for....  Cheers, Ron..."
585703,spinnerbaitking,2011-05-23 02:14:00,1622,"A little far for me to go but keep up the good fight, now show those kids how to catch a nice Pike SBK"
585704,Terry,2011-05-23 02:14:00,14456,"it is great to see you doing this  I had a guy in a harbour tell me I couldn't fish it I told him much the same you did  cops came and told me I would get a ticket even though I told him it was federal water.. I left  I went to the cop shop some time later with proof, talked to the cop and he said he didn't care about the law or who was right or wrong, but by making me leave he defused the situation.........what a crock,...I wish I did what you did"
585705,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-23 02:17:00,0, I'm not sure why you are doing this but I do know that there are waters and Marinas you cannot fish that are navigable . Tadenac Bay is one of them. It's attached to Georgian Bay. The water and lake bottom have been owned by Americans for 100 years . You are not allowed to fish it or hunt it or travel into it. Natives can though and people who are lucky enough to be able to fish with them can... There are also Marinas who lease the water in and around their operation. Not something that you see a lot of but they are around. Hope you don’t end up with a large fine for something you didn’t know about.
585708,TJQ,2011-05-23 02:23:00,7806,LOL... giver Ron... Giver.  
585709,Pigeontroller,2011-05-23 02:26:00,2793,Good on ya Ron!
585733,Twocoda,2011-05-23 04:06:00,4130,"Much respect Ron ...fight the good fight ...maybe use your mission as leverage for the marina to build a ""fishing dock"" strickly for the purpose of kids fishing ...possibly in conjunction to some raised moneys that your local club can muster up through donations...just a thought ...im sure if the marina came out smelling like a rose...you could convince them to be on board...but here on OFC...we know who the REAL hero would be ...  CHEERS"
585749,Billy Bob,2011-05-23 10:06:00,5865,"Ron, While reading your post I was kind of on the fence back and forth....I am also one that doesn't like STUPID laws but sometimes they are for a good reason....since I am not familiar with the area in question I was a little bit hesitant to fully support your quest until you mentioned how kids could fish here if allowed....that put me fully into your corner and FULLY SUPPORT what you are trying to do here.....we need more kids to get out of the house and away from the electronics to appreciate our natural resources more and nothing is better then heading down to the fishing hole.  GREAT EFFORT Ron and PLEASE keep us posted, Bob"
585822,irishfield,2011-05-23 14:15:00,26272,Ron.. RON..RON.. sure hope they gave him one call !
585825,Handlebarz,2011-05-23 14:29:00,3790,Hope it goes good for ya Ron I have some lures packaged up to add to the get Ron out of Jail Auction we will be having on June 8th .  Giver hell out there Ron the kids will thank you and we sure do enjoy your entertainment.
585829,Woodsman,2011-05-23 14:40:00,1286,Although I wish you luck I suspect you may find different results when fishing from the shore.
585830,landry,2011-05-23 14:44:00,1005," It is obvious why he is doing this isn't it??? The water is navigable and can be owned by no-one!!!! Marinas have no right to claim the water as their own. If, as you say,  some marinas have been leased the water in their cove - I am sorry, that is just plain wrong!  Police backing them when there is no real legal grounds to do so is just an example of ""big business"" (at least big in that area) bullying! I got kicked out of one of those  roped off marina areas in Long Point once by a policeman. I felt bullied and left even though I felt there was no way they owned the water. I do realize that fisherman near boats and docks are annoying but those roped off areas in Long Point are massive - staking their claim on something that should not be able to be owned!  Good job Ron!  Landry"
585835,Guest gbfisher,2011-05-23 15:00:00,0," ""The water is navigable and can be owned by no-one!!!!"" I wish that were true butttt and it's onehellofa big one. That's not how it is.  I didn't say it was right or that what Ron was doing wrong. Just wanted him to know it is that way in different locations. I'd be the first one making an   out of myself if I felt thats where the good fishing was."
585838,landry,2011-05-23 15:09:00,1005," I got the idea you disagreed with Ron - sorry about that. Stuff like that (greed of the wealthy) really bugs me. I totally understand that they don't want people casting right around their $100 000 boats, (although the water next to their boat is obviously navigable as well) But this is not about dock fishing - that is a whole other debate - the roped off areas in Long Point are outrageously big!"
585839,Terry,2011-05-23 15:10:00,14456,"there are a few privately owned areas that you can't enter or fish..deeded from way back when......  and there are a few marinas and harbours that the fed gov has given complete control of, to the owners but..but they must be properly posted clearly stating the the fed gov has given them control otherwise they have no right to stop you..but as I and others have said the cops tend to side with their local business and screw the angler...  and as far as local gov stopping you from fishing from shore..if they don't stop everyone from trespassing...then in the real world they have no right to post no fishing as it is not within their mandate , power to do it legally..they do but it ain't right"
585855,Billy Bob,2011-05-23 16:35:00,5865,Just something for you all to think about.....kind of throwing a fly in the ointment...  Water doesn't belong to anyone.....but let's say you own one of those boat garages that are so common on the Kawarhan Lakes....that water is in the garage right....so can I dock my boat in your garage....
585856,landry,2011-05-23 16:45:00,1005," If it wasn't tied up or touching the boathouse structure then it would just be plain ignorant and idiotic, not illegal."
