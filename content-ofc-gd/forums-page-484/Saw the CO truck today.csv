626471,bucktail,2011-09-30 04:17:00,1857,I saw the CO truck on Upper Middle at the Bronte over pass today. Great seeing the truck around and kudos to them checking the west end of Lake O. I gave up stream fishing years ago cuz of the zoo it was...... I have no idea whats in season now above Lakeshore on the Bronte.  D
