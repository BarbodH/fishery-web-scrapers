625880,Headhunter,2011-09-28 17:52:00,5703,"Yup, sitting on the floor in the gym,in grade 5,  staring at a Black and White TV with an extremely snowy picture... but boy were we glad to have at least that! One of those moments in life that is forever burned into my memory. Heck, might even be the only thing left in there! HH"

625977,Fang,2011-09-28 22:44:00,1330,"Same here, sitting in the front row of the gym of Sherway Park Public school in Mississauga, watching it on TV. I was in Grade 2 and was wearing a homemade Paul Henderson #19 Team Canada jersey my mom made me. My all time favorite Leaf growing up. I had a ton of Henderson stuff signed sitting in my room. We used to go down to practices and wait out in the hall to get stuff signed. I remember being all bummed out one time when henderson didn't come out and I had to get Ellis, Keon and Jim McKenny's autograph. I'm all grown up now but came home today and pulled out my autographed Paul Henderson replica jersey I bought a few years ago and gat it a pat.  Just watched it again on you tube and got goosebumps  There will never be another series to compare with that  Esposito's meltdown interview after loosing game 4 (i think in vancouver) JP Parise talking a swing at the ref with his stick Eagleson being rescued from the Russian police and giving the crowd the finger Clarke breaking Kharlomov's ankle with a slash  And the 2 prettiest goals 1 by Henderson to win game 7 and 1 by Pete Mahovolich  Yes it was just like yesterday"
