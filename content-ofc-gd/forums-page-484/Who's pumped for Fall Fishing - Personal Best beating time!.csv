623790,Harrison,2011-09-22 13:38:00,2202,I Love Fall fishing!  I bet alot of us here at OFC have got our personal best fish in the fall.  I'd love to see some pics of them.  With every cast you have a chance at setting a new personal best.  This year I am going to try and top my PB smallie.  It's been a couple years since I have been able to put in some serious time on Simcoe in the fall.  Thinking the new XZone Swammer may help me beat my PB gal below.
