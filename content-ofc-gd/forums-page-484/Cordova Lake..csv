I am heading up to a cottage there for a few days and I am not sure whats in the lake. I'm not asking for spots just what types of fish are in the lake. Or is it not worth bringing my gear.  Thanks

Tried trolling crankbaits to cover as much water and not a single nibble. Would definitely go back though as it is a very beautiful lake and to redeem myself as well  http://www.redsfishin.com/3.html  ^ Written by a member of this site  Hope that helps and let us know how you make out!"
626166,Live2fish85,2011-09-29 12:15:00,1633,Thanks alot fishindude. I know what it is like fishing with out sonar. Not always the easiest thing to do. I will be bringing a portable one with me so I will atleast know the depth and that should help a bit. I didn't realize that it connected to the crowe river lol. When I lived in peterborough I used to head to the crowe river woth a buddy and fish there for pike alot so hopefully I can get some pike.  Thanks again.

626168,Live2fish85,2011-09-29 12:27:00,1633,Thanks Roy. I did that last night after posting this and did find some info on the fish in there. Hopefully I can do alright there.
