I was too critical apparently that while he was driving in rverse he shifted up like 5 times. Other things I had issue with as well. I guess I am going against the grain here. But I felt like if you don't have a crush or man crush on Ryan Gossling or whatever his name is and you have any sense of what a car can and can't do you won't like the movie. Yes I agree it had 3 cool scenes, the head bashing in scene, the final car chase and the motel shootup scene. However they base the entire plot development on my believing that he is the ultimate wheelman. An awesome driver. However in the first scene he doesn't get away from the helicopter. The helicopter has him pinned under a bridge and they leave because there is a murder reported. Anyway.... Give it an up or down.  Personally, if he had of talked a bit, or they built him up a bit with some history, or something, I may have felt something for him. I felt nothing, and as such I give this movie a 2 out of 5 stars. A resounding thumbs down, or a"
626263,Miracon,2011-09-29 16:34:00,200,Wow! The trailer looks awesome! Love to watch car movies but makes me sad (the Worse Half then!) sold his baby a few years ago! I loved doing burnouts in this beast...    Going to see the movie soon!

I just watched Fast 5 for the first time last night and much like you, couldn't get into because I was being so critical.  I'm sure I'll watch this movie at some point though. Maybe tonight, just cause you brought it up, lol"
626270,jedimaster,2011-09-29 16:47:00,3472,"I didn't even really find it a great car movie. Just mediocre with two ok car chases, at not so fast speed. haha, watch it by all means. just don't expect much, you may like it more."
626274,Miracon,2011-09-29 16:55:00,200, I really enjoyed Fast 5 so I'm sure it will be a while before another car movie comes out that can compare (despite the mistakes to the critical eye! Haha!). But I'm a huge Gosling fan...so between him and a car...it's enough for me!  Even if he gears up while in reverse (I've been known to that myself sometimes!!)
626276,Roy,2011-09-29 17:07:00,13728,I don't think anyone cares whether you give it a good or bad rating. They got your money. Their goal was not to make a movie but to take a little out of your pocket. They succeeded.  I'm sure they're sitting around a boardroom as we speak having a beer deciding which one to release to haul you back in towards the cash register.
626283,blaque,2011-09-29 17:23:00,2419,Thought Bad Boys 2 had one of the more memorable car scenes on the big screen.  But Will Smith looks a little pudgy in this shot (see driver in the picture)  
626285,irishfield,2011-09-29 17:28:00,26272,Dirty Mary Crazy Larry ! Brings back some great teen memories everytime I watch it... and I managed to not get dents in mine as those LTD's just couldn't keep up!
