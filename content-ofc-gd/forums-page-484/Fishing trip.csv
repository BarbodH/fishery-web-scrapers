While I was out there some of my buddy's got into fishing and  for the past couple of summers have been going up to Lake Talon near North Bay for a weekend. Now I think in the last 2 years they have only caught two pike and on small walter. Before I moved out to Manitoba I was living in Sioux Lookout and got absolutely spoiled with the fishing there. I want my buddies to get a good fishing experience in. Is there any place preferably in the Sudbury/North Bay area where the fishing is above average? Also a cabin rental nearby would be nice. I'd like to show the boys a shore lunch and just have a good time. So any suggestions are welcome and thanks in advance.  SP24"
