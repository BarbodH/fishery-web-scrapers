625932,kickingfrog,2011-09-28 20:19:00,8333,Buy the uninsulated jacket and use your own fleece. Layers are better anyway.
625959,adempsey,2011-09-28 21:57:00,1498," Sorry, I should have been more clear.  They are still on sale, but just not at the price they were last week ($100 for the parka and $90 for the bibs)."
626319,Sketty55,2011-09-29 18:36:00,52,"Thanks for the quick responses! I called Cabelas and yes the $99 sale is over so looks like I missed out. I'm still debating the purchase at the new price (and justifying it to my wife....i've already used the buy now, think later tactic too many times). If anyone did order one and finds that it doesn't fit or it's not for them, just let me know. I take a large but i'm not picky on size, I'll even take the 5xl if necessary. I'll just do my best Daryl Cronzy impression and eat all the fish i catch and the jacket should fit me in a couple of years."
626326,mike rousseau,2011-09-29 18:47:00,4661,   its also free shipping and a free 60 dollar tackle bag
626328,Sketty55,2011-09-29 18:52:00,52, I see free shipping but not the tackle bag. Either my eyes are going bad or they've removed that part of the sale too.
626338,mike rousseau,2011-09-29 19:20:00,4661,  put a jacket and bibs in your shopping cart and the tackle bag appears...
626371,wkrp,2011-09-29 20:40:00,656,What size is the free tackle bag?
626377,Cosmos,2011-09-29 21:25:00,588,"  It's big, i can't tell you exactly because it's still in original package - this is from cabelas web site:  The Super Magnum Bag holds twelve 3700-series adjustable utility boxes. It holds one Cabelaâ€™s 3600 box in the front pocket and one 3600 box in each of the two side pockets. Two specially designed Storm-Proof external pockets for your camera, cell phone, GPS or VHF radio. Four external pockets, including three large mesh pockets. Dimensions: 27""L x 14""H x 12""D."
626379,kickingfrog,2011-09-29 21:33:00,8333,"Big is right, I was quite surprised how big it was."
626448,tomO,2011-09-30 01:36:00,363,I've got that bag and it holds alot in fact I'm thinking of going smaller cause its so heavy to lug around.
624191,mike rousseau,2011-09-23 15:18:00,4661,I shipped mine to ny them picked it up  Ordered Thursday... Picked it up Tuesday...
624217,scugpg,2011-09-23 16:20:00,1373,drop down here lots of rain to play with today!
624283,adempsey,2011-09-23 19:37:00,1498,"Came straight to my house in London, ON via Canada Post.  Was a pleasant surprise.  I am used to having to go to the local post office since they never actually tried to deliver the packages when I lived in Toronto."
624295,landry,2011-09-23 19:52:00,1005,"Price went down again today - now the bibs and jacket can be had for $99 each!!!!!! My XL suit was too big - had to ship it to their return centre in Markham for an exchange - their XL is massive!!!!!!!!!!! (even with 2 layers of fleece). I am a stout, 5'8"" and the Large is the right size. FYI, if ordering"
624296,NANUK,2011-09-23 19:53:00,797,"Cabelas Guideware X300 rainwear is by far the best money can buy, you will not be disappointed!! That is a great deal @ 50% off."
624320,Crazy Ivan,2011-09-23 20:28:00,184, Can I ask what your total was incl shipping and duty? I'm thinking of getting this deal.
624325,Crazy Ivan,2011-09-23 20:56:00,184,"Nevermind, I just went through the checkout to see what it would be. $300 total for bibs and jacket.  $20 was for shipping and $70 was for tax.  A good deal but still to much for me."
624355,landry,2011-09-23 22:23:00,1005,it will be 200 plus 70 = $270 (if u phone it in and ask for free shipping-worked for me)
624371,adempsey,2011-09-23 22:56:00,1498,"  For me:  Merchandise = $214.98  ($115 for the parka, $100 for the bib) - note: the sale was continued and the parkas are now $100 and the bibs are $90. Fee = $3.50 Postage = $19.95 Tax = $74.27 ORDER TOTAL = $312.70  Looks liked I paid more than I should have, but still a good deal IMO."
624409,tbayboy,2011-09-24 01:55:00,1497,Wouldn't have anything to do with that rip I heard on Buckhorn eh Mike? (or the Frogs left in the boat on the highway)
624410,Sawyer,2011-09-24 02:00:00,48,"Hey Guys,  Without this post, I wouldn't have known about the great deals on Cabela's guidewear products - specifically, the regular uninsulated jacket and the uninsulated tall bibs  Last week Sunday, I purchased the Jacket - $129 & Bibs - $109.  Today, I checked Cabelas.com and learned that the jacket is now $79!!!  I contacted Cabelas customer service - online live agent, and I am pleased to let you know that they providing the difference in the form of a $50 gift card.  According to the customer service agent, it is Cabelas policy to refund the balance, in a form of a gift card, if there is a price change within 7 days of purchase.  To all the folks that have purchased Cabelas products within the last 7 days and today find its price reduced - I encourage you to contact Cabelas.  Cabelas - you know what customer service is all about!  -Sawyer"
624416,danc,2011-09-24 02:48:00,4677,"I don't need a new rainsuit. But I'll in visiting two different Cabelas stores in about a week and a half or so. One in Owatonna Minnesota, and another in Kansas City Kansas. Can't wait."
624422,moemoe,2011-09-24 03:53:00,352,"Splurged on the jacket only, 99.99 plus 50cents shipping and shipped by usps, thanks guys! I did a phone order and she said the total was 115"
624426,registerfly,2011-09-24 04:34:00,198,"Got my reels today, 1 week pretty good. Reels BTW are super smooth. They say daiwa all over them"
624527,adempsey,2011-09-24 16:49:00,1498," Also getting a $25 gift card after I made the call.  Tried emailing CS, but that didn't get me very far.   Of course, now that I have a gift card it will most likely end up costing me more at the end of the day than if I just sucked it up, lol!!"
625238,kickingfrog,2011-09-27 01:58:00,8333,"Picked up my stuff today.  A word to the wise. For Cabelas ""midnight/black"" is dark blue and black. Clearly I did not look at the colour photo and only base my choice on the description.  Just noticed while I was checking my order to get the price difference refunded that on my order it is listed as night/black...  I don't feel too bad, I don't know what colour forest meadow is either."
625247,landry,2011-09-27 02:19:00,1005,I got a 25$ card too - thanks for the heads up on their 7 day policy:)

They had some ""hot deal"" 4 day sale where they were 50-60% off (or something close), and then for some reason went on sale again not long after for another 4 days at an even lower price.  Call them up and see if you can get the sale price.  Just say your web order messed up or something"

Bibs (99) + Parka (115) They still have lots in stock but this usually changes quickly on their blowout deals. I got hosed for 75 for duty and taxes (but I asked and got free shipping) which sucks but it still came to 290, which is much cheaper than BPS 100 mph suit at 500+ Supposed to be the best raingear there is. Landry"
622023,solopaddler,2011-09-16 10:28:00,8605,Thanks Landry! I was in the market for new rainwear. Free shipping and had the items sent to the UPS Store in Lewiston NY for pick up.  Total was $215. That is an unbelievable deal.
622028,scugpg,2011-09-16 11:29:00,1373,That is an awesome deal! I was lucky enough to get a gander mtn suite similar to that before they were discontinued. Shipped to pt huron free and brought it over.  Its crazy the BPS one is over $500 here.
