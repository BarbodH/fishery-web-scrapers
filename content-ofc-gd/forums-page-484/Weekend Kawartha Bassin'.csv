Caught on Wacky rigs and Jig and Craw. Seems to be a hit and miss. One outing would be good and the next not so good."
626281,Rattletrap2,2011-09-29 17:16:00,1652,They are all nice ones! lucky you!
626282,TerryC,2011-09-29 17:20:00,196,Those are all good looking fish. The second pic of the smallie is real nice.  Clarence
626289,jbailey,2011-09-29 17:32:00,866,niceee fish!!! lookin to get me some of those this weekend!
626295,fishindevil,2011-09-29 17:54:00,6254,some very decent bass for sure !! well done that last ones a brute !!  cheers
626299,johnnyb,2011-09-29 17:58:00,3413,"Nicely done, Jim!  I ended up camping with the kids at that spot we talked about....but was boatless....just means we'll have to go back next year  Keep those buckets coming....lookin' real good"
626305,eman,2011-09-29 18:07:00,101,"whats the ratio of smallies to largies in the Kawarthas? I know that question is fairly general (what lake, what location, etc.) 50-50, way more smallmouth, just general thoughts. I have only fished the Kawarthas once from a houseboat (caught one smallie)"
626321,jimmer,2011-09-29 18:42:00,2730,"Glad you were able to get away, Sunday was amazing. Too bad about the boat, but the family stuff is good. What did you think of the place? I might hit the lake once more before the end of the year."
626323,Roy,2011-09-29 18:45:00,13728,"Some dandies there, Jimmer. Thanks for sharing."
626324,jimmer,2011-09-29 18:45:00,2730,"There are plenty of both, but you're best to target one or the other. We usually catch more of the largies. Lucky on that day to get so many smallies. Smallies tend to be a tougher fish to catch for me anyways. I always look for weeds when starting out for the day."
626340,johnnyb,2011-09-29 19:22:00,3413," For car-camping, it was good.  Nice that we had the ""wilderness"" section to ourselves...and more or less proved that we can make it work with the baby.  I could see it being a great place to stay for a weekend fishing trip...not a ton of activities for the kids during the day.  I'm dying to hit that lake though....the launch is WAY better than the adjoining lake I was on last year.  I'd be more than happy to join you if you make it out again....drop me a line  Oh...on Sunday we trotted back to the in-laws...took a dip in the chilly water and sight-fished the second biggest smallie of the year...spotted from the dock"
626358,jimmer,2011-09-29 19:49:00,2730,"What was that, 60 degrees or something crazy like that? Don't you just love sight fishing from the dock :-) I have next week off, just saying."
626362,johnnyb,2011-09-29 19:56:00,3413,65 degrees....told my 11yr old that I'd go in if he did....was bearable enough that I got in first and was able to act calm enough that he thought it wasn't really that bad  Off all week...hmmm....msg sent
626453,MCTFisher9120,2011-09-30 01:46:00,3761,"Great job, nice smallies and big bucket!"
626489,Harrison,2011-09-30 11:25:00,2202,Nice fish jimmer.  Kudos as I know the Kawarthas have fished tough the last few weeks.  Bound to turn on soon.
626560,jimmer,2011-09-30 17:46:00,2730,"Yes, I could have used some of those a few weeks ago. Their mouths must be healing"
