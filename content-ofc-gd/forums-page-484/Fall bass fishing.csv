626549,aquaman456,2011-09-30 15:43:00,13,What's the bass fishing like in rivers/creeks this time of year? Haven't been out in a while because I've been in school!
626556,manitoubass2,2011-09-30 17:11:00,11391," Depends where your fishing??? And all the other lovely vaiables of course.  I'm finding them on current seams in 8-10 FOW, and moving into rock/mud bottom shallows throughout the day.  Also finding them in shallow rock cover in heavy current, 2-4 FOW.     "
