415163,HTHM,2009-12-24 20:32:00,4082,"I was researching how to launch solo, and came across this gem:  ""I have a friend with one of those remote control trolling motors on his boat and what he does is let down the trolling motor and then just backs the boat in the water till it floats off. He then runs the boat out away from everything or everbody and then parks his truck. Once parked he goes down to the dock or bank whichever the case may be and whistles like Roy Rogers with his hand in his pocket. The boat then starts toward him like trigger and everyone around is standing around baffled as he brings it in with the remote...."""
415168,shane,2009-12-24 20:40:00,652,HAHAHA!   I'd buy a remote-control just to be able to do that.

415179,Roy,2009-12-24 20:59:00,13728,"The boat will not float off the trailer with the trolling motor down. It's below the boat, remember? I bought my first RF motor when they first came out and did the ""Trigger"" thing while up on the Gouin Reservoir in Quebec....it was funny....at the time."

415449,Fishnwire,2009-12-26 16:10:00,983,When electric trolling motors were still fairly new my buddy had one on his square-stern canoe and told his girlfriend it was just a rudder.  She believed him (for a while) and was truly amazed at how fast he was able to paddle that canoe.
