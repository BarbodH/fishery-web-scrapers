413912,Fang,2009-12-20 18:10:00,1330,"Well since buying myself a new steelhead rod, the fall season has been a bust just trying to get out and fish. Always too busy, wind/weather, rivers blown out.  Went for a drive on Saturday and tried checking out an old spot only to find the rivermouth frozen completely over. Saw track and holes drilled so I thought what the heck and got my ice fishing gear together for the trek out Sunday morning.  Things were slow but had a good chat with a couple of the locals who have been out the last 2-3 days on 4+ inches of good black ice and it was making ice all the time I was out. Really good to hear that ping and crack again.  Fished a slack water area in about 6ft and had one hit on a small silver spoon tipped with Berkley Maggots. Asleep at the wheel!!  Moved out off the shoreline to a bit deeper water next to the channel after I saw a couple guys go first. I like this spot as it comes off a wall and is a natural funnel for fish moving in and out of the estuary. About 30 minutes later a good solid whack and fish on. Nice fight and colors. Cell phone shot as the camera was left on the dresser this morning.      No hits on roe at all . Looking forward to a few more trips over the holdiays"
