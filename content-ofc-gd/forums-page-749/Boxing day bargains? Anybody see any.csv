415379,Fang,2009-12-26 02:42:00,1330,Saw a forced air propane heater at Liquidation World on Thursday.It's one of those tube ones with a blower. Hooks into a 20lb propane tank and has electric start. Would do great in my garage/workshop  35000 BTU for $68  Other than that I'm not busting my hump to battle any crowds tomorrow. Think I'll check out some ice to see what damage the rain did. If it tightens up I'll be fishing on Sunday  Gotta look around for a center pin this winter. That was on my Xmas list but never did get out to look at any

415441,Dara,2009-12-26 15:50:00,3052,We have a bylaw prohibiting stores from opening on boxing day. I view this as a good thing.

415587,Fang,2009-12-27 00:32:00,1330,"Stopped by Fishing World in Hamilton. Picked up a new hand warmer, ice line and headed home again. Stock levels looked really low. Hope they had good sales this holiday season."
415734,Blake,2009-12-27 18:01:00,418,Fishing World was very busy this holiday season.  Most of the ice gear has all been restocked and ready for the hardwater.  Look forward to seeing more OFC people at the store.
415745,mbac31,2009-12-27 18:30:00,904,Stock levels were low. Seems like they have sold alot of stuff. I'm sure Blake has more in the back.    Seems to be the only store this year that has as advertised items actually in stock. Good on them. Good on OFC guys supporting local.
415765,Fisherpete,2009-12-27 20:26:00,1814,"LeBarons had a no-tax sale, plus you could use your club card for an additional 10% off... needless to say all the gift certificates I had been stockpiling are now history!"
415767,mbac31,2009-12-27 20:40:00,904,Lol
415823,John Bacon,2009-12-28 00:40:00,3277,Technically not Boxing day sale because these are the standard prices at Bentree Outlet; but I picked up a couple of Cannon Easy Troll 2 Down Riggers for $125 each.  I also picked up some J-Plugs for 2.25 and 2.75 each.  I plan to try a little salmon fishing this summer.  He also had Yozuri minnows for around $4.
