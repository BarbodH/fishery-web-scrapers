414990,Garry2Rs,2009-12-24 04:56:00,1425,"I am sure that most of us will make some quiet New Years resolutions about learning new baits or techniques next season. Mine will involve large swimbaits, of the type most often used for monster Bass in California...BBZ-1 etc. What kind of baits or techniques will you be trying to learn over the next 12 months? Garry2R's"
414992,irishfield,2009-12-24 05:00:00,26272,We've hired a diver to tie fishies on Terry's ice rod line !   Some different presentations for Lakers next summer.
414993,bigfish1965,2009-12-24 05:01:00,3382," Terry did the same thing, so two guys down there should help him  I want to learn to to drop shotting in places you would not normally do it."
414997,BillM,2009-12-24 05:07:00,17367,"Gotta get better at nymphing below a strike indicator.    More time with the flyrod, etc etc"
415003,discophish,2009-12-24 06:05:00,392,"How to dodge and react faster when my girlfriend is casting!  Also, more productive using the downriggers and learning the currents.  Seems to be an art that I just don't have yet."
415006,Twocoda,2009-12-24 06:19:00,4130,this might be the year to experiment with spey casting
415023,solopaddler,2009-12-24 11:54:00,8605,"  Me too Garry, I really want to give the hollow bodied shad baits a serious go in 2010. Ironically I just got some of the Basstrix baits in the mail yesterday, merry Christmas to me."
415036,walleye_man,2009-12-24 12:59:00,135,i would like to learn more about useing flipping jigs and maby learn how to fly fish so i can get them browns of the fly
415040,splashhopper,2009-12-24 13:18:00,2931,learn how to cast my darned float reel.  spend more time on my canoe on the rivers as well as the small lakes.
415049,JohnF,2009-12-24 13:54:00,3494,Gotta get the flyrod under control. Got a bunch of bass flies that SingingDog sent down here and what little water time they had was spoiled by my ineptitude. So that's my target this year - bass on the fly.  The other thing I need to deal with is getting something living (other than me) attached to one end of whatever line et al I put on my brand spankin' new 13 footer. Be fun to experience some of those big silver critters the rest of you catch. Mebbe I'll have to settle for some big ole carp to break it in.  JF
415056,Harrison,2009-12-24 14:12:00,2202,"I am going to try and get out of my comfort zone fliippin with flippin jigs, etc for largies and try more crankbaits, especially deep divers.  Last years goal at this time was to focus on sight fishing smallies, which I now LOVE, hope to hone it more this upcoming season!"
415069,backbay,2009-12-24 14:54:00,773,"I'm going to try to fish top water a little more often with spooks and that sort of bait; I've gone away from those in the last season or two. Definitely, I'll fish larger soft swimbaits; can't wait!"
415076,asdve23rveavwa,2009-12-24 15:12:00,2690,"Get out with my new boat and do some serious bass fishing, topwater with buzz baits, poppers etc!  Also get out with my old man at least once for some specks, we haven't done it in years and now that he is in his 70's I don't want to pass up the opportunity for some more memories!"
415077,tnt,2009-12-24 15:19:00,63,Great post Garry!  I'm gonna try and be a bit more versatile when it comes to ice fishing for the winter and learn some more about catching fish off the riggers for the soft water season.
415079,Curtis,2009-12-24 15:20:00,83,"My biggest goal is to learn a new lake this summer i have my eyes set on lake seymour ie. trent river.. I also want to perfect my drop shotting techniques, i have the largemouth on lock but still cant dial in on smallmouth over 12""..  As for more things i can not wait to get out searching for crappies on rice and chemong.. My ice fishing goal this year is to catch more fish with artificial than live or dead bait...  CT"
415081,ped,2009-12-24 15:22:00,16,Better casting aim and catch my first steelhead!
415685,Spiel,2009-12-27 13:45:00,9065,My only fishing related resolution is to recover from surgery and get back to a level of fishing I once enjoyed. That would include more use of my boat and dusting of the fly fishing gear!
415687,canadian_copper,2009-12-27 14:01:00,925,WELL IM PRETTY MEAN WITH THE SENKO AND TUBE THESE PAST 2 YRS BASS FISHIN BUT I KNOW THE NUMBER 1 BAIT FOR BIG FISH IS THE JIG AND PIG. SO FOR MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT I GOT 2 NEW BAITCASTIN RODS AND REELS SITTIN IN THE GARAGE ITCHIN TO BE USED. SHOULD BE AN INTERESTING FIRST DAY WITH THEM BUT PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT IM TOLD  LOL
415689,MCTFisher9120,2009-12-27 14:14:00,3761,Spinnerbaits and Heavy cover jigs
415696,lookinforwalleye,2009-12-27 14:38:00,4399,I have two resolutions one is to actually get out on the water more and secondly is to learn how to use a fly rod.
415713,Fishnwire,2009-12-27 16:05:00,983,"Summer '09 was the first season that I got serious about throwing top-waters.  I'm completely addicted to that, so next year's SMB season is going to be a lot of this...    I am going to try putting down my top-water rods long enough to try a couple of things out though.  The last couple of years I got right into soft plastics but believe it or not, never tried Senkos...I'm going to pick some of those up.  I also never put the time and energy into drop shotting that I should have.  I tried a few times but didn't have great success and relied on other presentations instead.  I want to get a decent baitcasting outfit and get good on that.  I've only ever used cheap bait reels and have never liked them but am told if I get a good one I'll probably like it a lot more.  I've got a thread in Classified looking for a decent right hand reel...PM me if you've got one for sale.  Also, I want to gain confidence in plastic baits in favour of live bait through the ice.  I've tried a few times but had limited success and always end up falling back on live minnows.  I used to use a lot of live bait in the summer, but have totally gotten away from it in favour of scented plastic.  Not having the hassle of live bait is nice.   Good thread, really got me thinking."
415732,tdotfisherman,2009-12-27 17:51:00,317,"My New Years resolution for last year was to improve my jigging technique, when jigging grubs back to the boat. I think I got the hang of it this year, and I caught a nice number of Walleye in the fall up on Georgian Bay with this technique..  My fishing New Years resolution for 2010... Probably is to give Musky fishing more of a go. Last year we only got out targeting Musky one time.. this year I'll probably improve my effort and time trying to catch one.. on a side note, devote a bit more time in 2010 to Steelhead fishing.."
415743,Joeytier,2009-12-27 18:26:00,3990,I'd like to finally try nymphing with a strike indicator for steelhead.
415749,tjsa,2009-12-27 18:42:00,1578," Where from Mike, my bud has been using them for 2 seasons. He got them in California of all places!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
