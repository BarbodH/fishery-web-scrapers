I know i dont ..a large part of fishing is the commerodery that goes along with it ...and in this community when a subject get strayed away from fishing topics you learn who you would or would not share your time with in the river or on the boat...

415627,anonymous,2009-12-27 03:03:00,58,"Here's the thing, I live in the Niagara region where these animals are nusances to the farmers around me. The year I moved in here within a kilometer of my house 3 dogs were lost to coyotes in that summer. Last year the house behind me on the next road over lost their dog to a coyote. A farmer I help out often figures he loses 10% of his crop and several calves each year to coyotes. I have permission to shoot deer, racoons, coyotes as well as an assortment of birds. He's a beef farmer and grows field corn for the cattle. This year he planted over an acre of sweet corn for human consumption and the racoons cleaned out the entire acre of sweet corn. The deer and birds eat his grapes, soy, corn, etc. For him, the hunting is pest control. His beef and the food for them is paramount. If I take a deer in the corn or soy fields we eat it, if I take migratory birds in the corn fields, we eat them. If I take a coyote or racoon they go into the manure pile. I pay for all the permits required for him to dispose of pest animals and it works out for all of us. We all get meat, I get a good oppurtunity to hunt and he loses less crop/livestock.  Until any of you who have lived in a city all your life understand the point of view from farmers, who grow the food you eat, you guys really have no legs to stand on when it comes to shooting animals that are not for table fare."
415644,smally21,2009-12-27 04:33:00,993,"forgive me if this is the wrong thread what are the rules and/or accepted practises for farmers/landowners to shoot pests on their land?  hopefully facts not opinions....do they require licences, or need toobserve seasons, etc.  thanks"
415645,Vanselena,2009-12-27 04:33:00,269, Very well said
415651,cram,2009-12-27 04:45:00,1733," They probably do more damage than good.  When coyote populations are pressured by predation or hunting the ones left over have larger litters.  They are kind of unique that way.   You start with 10, kill 3, and the 7 left over will have more pups than they would have if there were still 10.  I don't know what the answer is, but its not hunting.  And as those of you who know me will sa, i am not anti-hunting at all.   I am against killing coyotes just for fun, or because they eat your deer.  I know a lot of people who kill every northern pike or musky they catch because ""they eat the walleye"".   To me seems just as stupid, only with coyotes its self-defeating."
415653,cram,2009-12-27 04:48:00,1733,"  Maybe.  WHy not just vaccinate somehow so that their breeding is less effective.  Also, the urban coyotes and rural coyotes are completely different beasts......how does a hunting season in the bush control the coyote problem around your house?"

415655,Twocoda,2009-12-27 05:24:00,4130, If a farmers livestock is threatened he can shoot and kill animals at any time of year this includes the neighbors dog ...there are permits however  for animals /birds that do not threaten the livestock but do threaten their food such as deer/canadian geese etc. The permit is issued to the farmer on a yearly basis (if he applies) and is called a scare permit...means he can unload @ them but not to kill unless its open season Most farmers all have licenses for the certain game during a certain season but more importantly they pay for their varmint permit to protect their livelihood so that they can produce tablefare....  If you ate today ...thank a farmer for raising disease free table fare...personally i have tried almost every type of wild food there is to consume through different fund raisers @ gun clubs and ill  NEVER have raccoon/yote on any table that i eat at ....but i would kill every single coon that found its way into our corn storage or barns ....the need to kill a yote has never arisen for me but has for many friends...so be it
415657,hammercarp,2009-12-27 05:37:00,964,"Coyotes respond to an abundance of food by having larger litters not as a result of being hunted. I don't believe there is any difference between urban and rural coyotes. Urban coyotes are simply there because of increasing human and increasing coyote populations. Last years rural coyote is this years urban coyote. If you reduce the coyote population in rural areas there will less to become urban coyotes. Less coyotes is less coyotes. For people that scoffed at the thought of coyotes attacking humans. You are wrong, as stated they killed a young girl on the east coast and there are growing reports of people being confronted by them.If they don't fear people it wont be long before they start treating people as prey. In answer to the question about land owners shooting animals that are damaging their property or livestock. You can go to the ministry and if you show them proof of that. They will issue you a permit to kill a number of those animals. You do not need a hunting license for this."
415661,cram,2009-12-27 05:55:00,1733," Do some reading, Hammercarp.  A simple google search will likely do.  I think you'll find...  - the#1 factor in determining coyote pop is food supply (you're right). - coyotes pops respond to hunting/predation pressure by having larger litters. (i think its funny that you state this to be wrong....its pretty simple stuff that's widely known/accepted). - urban and rural coyotes are different in a lot of ways (solitary vs packs, nocturnal vs. hunting during the day, etc) but the most important factor is that you can't really go hunting for urban coyotes.  Even if you killed every coyote in the bush, there'd still be lots around the cities.  They are established here, and growing in pop regardless of what hunters do in the bush. - attacks on humans are remarkably rare.   You likley have a greater chance of catching salmonella from a snapping turtle than you do of getting attacked by a coyote.  They do kill a lot of pets and livestock though."

415675,canadadude,2009-12-27 12:33:00,769,"Cotton tail rabbits are on the high end of the cycle now which puts the coyote population on the high end of the cycle. When the rabbit cycle crashes so will the coyote, unhealthy starving coyotes won't produce large litters and the population will drop. It's like the Black Bear population and the amount of berries available in the summer, if the mother dosn't gain enough weight in the summer she won't reproduce in the winter. This being said with the bonanza berry crop this past summer there should be a high population of cubs come this spring.  As for hunting coyotes I don't kill them, but I really could careless if others hunt them, they can be a real nusiance animal in alot of cases. I think if left alone mother nature will control the populations and the high population of coyotes we see today may turn to a very scarce population in a few years, this is the way populations have gone forever."
415678,Chris,2009-12-27 13:01:00,405," So let me get this straight....it's ok to hate on people that hunt coyotes for fun, and then turn around and go fishing, impaling God's little creatures on razor sharp hooks, fighting them to exhaustion and then holding them up for the prize photo.....all in the name of fun.  Pretty hypocritical in my opinion."
415681,dave524,2009-12-27 13:16:00,4508,"I too, grew up in Niagara. My experience farming, hunting and as a naturalist go back to the fifties, my dad an avid hunter go back further. During the 50's and early 60's, reports of coyotes or as they were reported then, brush wolves, were about like the cougar reports of today. They were almost non existent. Deer populations then were but a fraction of what they are today, same with Canada Geese, resident Mallard populations were a fraction of today. Possums even were a rarity, though they seemed to spike in population in the 80's and now levelled off. On the other hand, populations of Ruffed Grouse, Woodcock and Ringedneck Pheasants in Niagara have plummetted. Controlled hunter number shotgun deer hunts in WMU 89 did not start till the mid 70's, when the population could support it. I tramped the countryside extensively during my teens from my parents house in Pelham Township, the same woodlots now have deer and coyotes were there was none back then. The increase in the deer, coyote and Canada Goose population in Niagara probably surpasses the increase in human population in the past 50 or so years. Even beavers are returning to Niagara, so much has changed in my years. The biggest change, is the in the behaviour of the animals themselves, far bolder, little fear of man. This combined with expanding human population into previously open areas and the increase in the population of deer, goose and coyote at the same time has created today's problem.  The coyote explosion is very similar to the cormorant explosion, historically they may always have been here, but never in the numbers of today. I bet some of those who question the ethics of those hunting coyotes would be first in line calling for a cull of cormorants when they decimate the fish stocks of one of their favourite lakes."

If they watch there pack numbers dwindle everytime they hear a boom maybe they will look elsewhere.  Also how many of you that are against the hunting of coyotes would hunt cormorants? If you would, would you eat everyone of them that you killed?  Jason"

I love doing both and will continue to do so as long as they are legal, so have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year."

No different from your dog....maybe more intelligent, actually.  i don't blame farmers who shoot them....that's different.  Same with shooting those who come to your property to lure your pets away.

CGN is a gun/hunting forum where there is mainly a fishing forum so there are totally different people at each. its fun toying with people over there (you...  ) while things are usually more serious on this forum. gotta tone things down a bit for this site which contains many lieberals...  you likely saw that thread on CGN about someone crying that the yotes are eating all the deer and everyone was against me because some senile old timer and his buddies started spewing their filth. now go over to OOD forums where the same topic came up. most there agree with the exact same points i made over on CGN. forums are weird that way...if one ""credible"" member states something, his ignorant buddies feel like they are obligated to follow suit whether its true or not.  in person i am one of the nicest and polite guys you'll meet and i am more than willing to go on a hunt with anyone ive had arguments with on the intraweb. the internet is for entertainment    well that sums it up right there as to the type of person you are. ANYONE who calls coyote hunting mean automatically loses all credibility in a coyote hunting debate. you are trying to educate hunters when you have no ""hands on"" experience with yotes...kinda like a gun hating liberal trying to teach me about firearms. you can read all you want but it doesnt mean squat.  how about you go talk to some people who have lost their dogs, cats, calves, chickens, etc to yotes and then we'll talk. your argument that hunting yotes will somehow result in higher populations is ridiculous. their populations are mainly determined by habitat and FOOD. they will not start producing more offspring unless the food is there to support them.  exactly how many years have you spent in the bush to backup your statements?"
415755,Cookslav,2009-12-27 19:32:00,1457,"To be honest the Anti Coyote-hunting thought proccess here is actually a bit disturbing to me....  Its no different then fishing in many ways when you sit and think about it.  People catch salmon and strip them of roe with no intention of eating them...sure Salmon are at the end of their life cycle but the point is they are caught for fun, and not consumed. People catch gobies snap their backs and toss them on shore with no intention of eating them....sure they are an invasive species, but in truth as far as being a population control argument its even less effective then say shooting coyotes as population control right? People catch Pickerel or Whitefish from 40+ feet and then release them knowing they are more then likely already toast...those ethics are worse if you ask me We as angler impale live bait fish to lure bigger fish by the dozens...ten time over in a season for some of us.  I guess the point I'm getting at is you can't put a value on one creatures life over the other, unless your playing favorites...  I beleive that enjoying a tradition passed down through the generations is ethical. I beleive that participating in what I consider a population controlling effort(no matter how small) is ethical. In saying that I also belive that not harvesting, or attempting to make use of the animal is very backwards to the traditional sport that has been handed down to us. I also believe it is vital that We ethical hunters/fisherman stick together and support each other even if its not your cup of tea. Because uneducated anti's and educated anti's alike would love this kind of discussion to be made public as propiganda to leverage a ban on Coyote hunting alltogether...then how long until fishing is in their sights?"

They're here because there has been lots of game.  Its cyclical.  Once there's less food they'll drop as well.  Also, sinker is right.  When their population is pressured they multiply more.    If there was a bounty on them and every hunter in ontario started shooting them....there'd be more in 2 yrs than we have now.  So, what's the point?  If one is getting too close, you should dispose of that one.  To go hunting ones in the bush that aren't hurting anyone......to me seems exactly like killing a shark for its fin."

Stop giving them a reason to come around and they won't. The situation is approaching a point where this is going to become a big problem.

As people try to live in a more ""eco friendly"" fashion wildlife will cohabitate with them. I think we are seeing the rebirth of trapping. Not for fur but to remove nuisanse wildlife. I know coyotes are very difficult to trap and almost impossible to live trap. I think shooting every one that you get an opportunity to won't hurt either. If you know a trapper give him the hide or the carcass for him to skin."

I am installing motion detector lights, these work very well on urban coyotes. The urban/rural issue is very different since trapping and hunting is not permissable. It is about teaching people not to let your cats run at large, not to let your dogs off lead in a park, secure garbage in animal-proof containers and use common sense. As we green up some areas of town and develop others, this is the natural result. We have to figure out how to live with it."

415509,Cast-Away,2009-12-26 19:34:00,790,I live in Newmarket and we'v had coyotes for a few years now. The rabbit and cat populations are way down now. The coyotes have started targeting small dogs in our neighbourhood. The local animal control does not seem to care about this.
415516,ch312,2009-12-26 19:46:00,1590," tell that to the groups of guys who take 100+ yotes every winter with dogs. how about those hunters who are really into yote hunting and take dozens every year? maybe the trappers across ontario who take thousands every winter might have an impact?  your average hunter who gets out a few times each season will have no impact on yote populations, but serious hunters, those who run dogs, and trappers help to keep the populations in check. if we all just stopped killing yotes today the population would skyrocket for a while until there is not enough food left or disease kills them off before the numbers started decreasing. the numbers of wildlife would go down while livestock predation would rise."
415532,hammercarp,2009-12-26 20:25:00,964, Come on. If thousands of hunters hunted coyotes exclusively for two weeks a year like they do for deer it would definately have an impact on their population. Especially if it were timed to have maximum impact. I have another question to those that have suggested that you can cause them to move if you cut off their food supply. There is no place for them to move to when their population is so high. They will seek out new sources of food.

While I was out  walking my dogs last week, they  found a small female that had been shot and curled under a tree to die. She was frozen to the ground and looked as if she was sleeping there.

What he says is true. People here know fishing, not nearly as much about wildlife population as they think. You all may have stayed at a Holiday Inn last night but the majority of you have no idea about current ecology. Most of you are totally out of touch with the marine ecology you all so love to fish so for people to question shooting a coyote is just senseless ramble.  I saw a thread on here about someone who was taking up trapping, who also admitted he didn't eat the game he trapped, and as well mentioned that the prices for the pelts might not even be worth him selling. I didn't see this type of sentiment in that thread.  Lew, with all respect to you, you will soon learn the issue with coyotes. If you have any pets that will be outside for a wizz or poop in the middle of the night you will want to watch over said pet with a gun because city slickers don't understand the 10 seconds it will take for the coyote to run your pet right into the rest of the pack where they will tear pieces of meat off your pet while it is still alive enduring the pain of being eaten alive by way of this process called natural selection.  Urban sprawl has lead way to deer being pushed into smaller groups, smaller groups equal easier mating, this gives more little bambis which allows for the coyotes which are multiplying just as fast as the deer. Just as you are seeing more deer entering into urban areas, you are seeing more coyotes getting into urban areas. This may be effective ferrel cat control but it's also responsible for many a lost dog."
415575,hammercarp,2009-12-26 23:44:00,964, Well I guess that just clears up everything. Thanks.
415596,rapala14,2009-12-27 01:01:00,44,"As long as the hunters/trappers use the pelts i'm all for it.  But i do gotta laugh a little when hunters say that without them the population for (enter animals name here) will explode if they don't hunt them.  Cause lets face it, if you left'em alone nature will eventually reach an equilibrium.  Just like it has for thousands of years.  But that being said, people DO and WILL ALWAYS hunt (which i am all for by the way).  so by all means use it for population control.  Its another variable to the equation that has to be considered.  Another thing to consider, they were here way before us.  We're pushin them, naturally they're gonna push back when they're against the wall. Put yourself on a raft in the middle of the ocean for 3 days with nothing but Fluffy the cat with ya... he'll start lookin mighty apetizing  Happy hunting lads and ladies"
415112,Curtis,2009-12-24 18:03:00,83,hey guys had an interesting morning that sparked my interest in predator hunting for coyotes.. This morning dad spoted one a field over from our house and i proceded to call and got him to come right into the back yard.. Anyways i shot my first coyote and it got me thinking that maybe i should start actualy targeting them.. God knows there is enough of them around...
415118,lew,2009-12-24 18:17:00,12766,"If it wan't bothering you, why did you kill it ??"
415120,azebra,2009-12-24 18:25:00,168, Perhaps a winter hat http://www.peterpaulfur.com/Images/HdHatCoyote.jpg
415124,Curtis,2009-12-24 18:41:00,83,to be honest im thinking i am going to make a a bucktail out his tail i already have a fox taill dried out i just need 2rs to makes it back to Ontario so he can make them up for me....  And i could write a whole list of problems about why to many coyotes is an issue.. Just think about how much you love your cat.. lol
415133,lew,2009-12-24 19:04:00,12766, Sorta like slaughtering sharks just to get the fin
415140,Dara,2009-12-24 19:35:00,3052," yep..cool huh...hey, its legal"
415149,hammercarp,2009-12-24 19:59:00,964,No it isn't. Not at all.
415150,lew,2009-12-24 20:00:00,12766,Everybodies entitled to an opinion and I gave mine.
415151,Muskieman,2009-12-24 20:02:00,2472,I used to hunt Coyote and Wolf... long range shooting .. Ruger Mini 14/.223 with 6-24x50 scope and Ruger Mini 30 7.62x39 also mounted with 6-24x50 scope.  All the pelts went to my cousin a trapper.[ 90%]  When I was younger 20 years or so ago  ..I was a member of the National Rifle Team..after leaving I needed something to do so I started hunting the dogs.  I left the sport 12 years and sold all my rifles...I'm getting the itch again.  I was out shooting with a buddy a few weeks ago and found that I have not lost my touch but  am very very rusty.  There's nothing wrong with hunting the dogs but make sure that you have plans for what will be done with the pelts and such... always recover your animal and don't let it go to waste.  RFS 
415153,Terry,2009-12-24 20:10:00,14456,there are way too many of them around these day I would think within the next few years there will be a bounty on them
415166,hammercarp,2009-12-24 20:36:00,964,I don't think so. The MNR believes the bounty system is useless as a coyote control. What is going to happen is they are going to start eating people. They have already tried and as more coyotes learn not to fear people this is bound to occur.
415173,mk2vr6,2009-12-24 20:47:00,14,"Coyotes eatting people?  LOL.  It is exactly the same as killing a shark for its fin.  You might think coyotes are a 'problem' right now, but this is how many many many animals ended up extinct.  We think they are a problem or valuable, and then as greedy humans we kill them until they are gone.  I hope coyotes do thin out the herds of humans.  If you are dumb enough to be eatten by one, you probably deserve it.  Natural selection, evolution at it's best."
415206,Twocoda,2009-12-24 22:52:00,4130,  thats almost the silliest thing i have ever read
415209,Terry,2009-12-24 22:56:00,14456,my baby a dingo ate my baby
415211,hammercarp,2009-12-24 23:00:00,964, May the Christmas Coyote leave something under your tree. 
415216,Mattones,2009-12-24 23:33:00,587,Curtis if you are near by i say we get together after deer season and hunt them. Its my plan for this winter.  Coyotes are really over populated. Thats why they are open all year.
415221,Gerritt,2009-12-24 23:51:00,6129,"Sorry... but I do not understand this... perhaps it is because I am not an avid hunter... But why would you want to kill something that you have no intention of putting on you're table? for the thrill? I can see Deer, Moose, Bear and Birds etc.... but a coyote?..  I fail to see the logic in doing this if it does not feed you and you're family...  Killing solely for the pleasure you derive from killing one of earths creatures in not acceptable in my opinion..  anyways i guess we all have different moral values... who am I to try and impose my morals upon you...  Happy killing.  G"
415224,Dara,2009-12-25 00:13:00,3052,  I think you are forgetting the young girl that was killed by them on Cape Breton island this summer. Maybe we should send you a few more bears too. The natural selection and evoloution is me blasting them with a 30-06.  And it is illegal to kill them and leave them. You must skin them and process the pelt. There are rules for hunting as well as fishing. You guys don't want the anti fishers tropming on your sport so please don't tromp on ours. Or soon we will all be sitting playing video games.
415225,Dara,2009-12-25 00:14:00,3052,  Do you keep every fish you catch or do you catch and release....
415229,outllaw,2009-12-25 00:19:00,1232,"coyotes are everywhere here in essex county. a fellow lost his labrador to a late season pack last winter. the windsor star ran an article on cats dis-appearing. i have found cat remains several occasions. they are cyclable . if theres game theres yotes.. mange is the norm. if there,s a problem they need to be controlled. one group 2 years  ago shot 234 of them in one winter. my friend a veternarian saw a coyote run by with a cat in its mouth 4 blocks from my house. . if controls needed so be it. ."
415234,GoneFishin,2009-12-25 00:34:00,349, Yah. Most people don't get to see that kind of stuff and think coyotes are rare and don't cause any problems. Most coyote hunting takes place on farm land. If there wasn't a coyote problem the farmers wouldn't bother letting people hunt their property! I live in Oshawa and the amount of coyotes around me is unbelievable so I can just imagine what they are like north of me.
415236,hammercarp,2009-12-25 00:39:00,964,Copied from another forum. See recipe below...  2-4 lbs of coyote meat 16 oz of apricot preserves 1 bottle BBQ sauce 1/2 purple onion diced 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp pepper 1/2 tsp garlic powder  Throw it all in a crock pot and let it cook for 8 hours. YUMMY!!
415238,misfish,2009-12-25 00:53:00,29133,"  I would give that a go Hammer. It,s meat after all.     As for the other posts. Lew ,I can understand your input.To some ,they are just another piece of mother natures creations,BUT,they,the yotes,do deplete other animals (yes mother nature at her best,sorta).They are growing much larger in numbers these days.If they are not controlled,they will get out of hand.Im not for shooting something that wont be used,but if they are getting over populated and doing no good,I have to side with the shooter.  If this makes me sound cruel,sry friend.   But like I said,I would give it a try like Hammer said.Although,I would sub the ,16 oz of apricot preserves,with cranberries.  Hope this helps.   Now for the shooting for the sake of just shooting.  If that was just a fun thing to you Curt,you need to rethink your hunting ethics.  Gman,,,,,,,   AMEN brother."
415275,Sinker,2009-12-25 03:31:00,8692,"I don't actually set up and hunt them, but I shoot everyone that I have an ethical shot at. When you lose a deer to coyotes, 50 mins after you shot the deer, you tend to get a hate on for them.  Coyotes are smart. The more you kill, the more they will breed. Killing them off isn't much help.  S."
415280,ChrisK,2009-12-25 03:56:00,2772,"Problem is there is no natural predators left to keep the population of coyotes in check cause we killed them off by building cities and highways everywhere effectively taking away their  habitat. Soooooo theoryedically know one is completely innocent here....Our forefathers were responsable for wiping out bears,wolves and cougars here in Ontario by changing their enviroment and now we have to deal with the aftermath of coyotes breeding like rats and eating themselves out of house and home.... In a sence we can have our cake and eat it too  Merry Christmas all and have a Happy New Year !!!"
