The boss had to work until 4PM so I had a FREE day  Hit Airport Rd just after 7AM. Grabbed my spud and auger and walked out 25 ft.  Three good whacks with the spud to get through...lotsa ice for a little fella like me   2.5-3 inches of black ice with an inch or inch and 1/2 of white ice on top. Just a dusting of powder snow on top. Things are looking good. First hole,  first drop, bang....a WHOPPING 5 incher ,but the skunk was gone and this ice season had officially begun. I generally fish 20-24 FOW at first ice for perch here. The reason being it generally holds the better sized fish. NOT today   I was molested by dinks all morning and by 11AM only had 2 keepers over 10 inches to show for the 30+  holes I had cut. Decided to fish shallower on a dropoff, which I never do at first ice here...but it worked today!!! From 11:30 until I FORCED myself to leave at 1:30...Something about Christmas Eve and family   It kills me to quit when the bite is on....but what can you do   Anyway..11:30 until 1:30 was pretty much a fish every drop with alot of quality 10+ inchers in that mix. I was in perch heaven. Caught a whack of fish but ended up only keeping 18 between 9.5 and 12 inches for a good feed or two.  Anyone who knows me knows I love seeing wildlife while I am out for a day on the water. Anyway just as I headed down the road and got past Casino Rama there was a group of about a dozen turkeys on my right JUST off the road. If the  fence wasn't there and I had 4 wheel drive I'm sure I could have clipped one with the car to bring home for christmas dinner.  A perfect... perfect day for me.  I don't know what it is I love about ice fishing so much...but it is something that  I really enjoy, especially when I have a day like today.  Play safe if you plan to get out on the ice over the holidays, and a Happy Holiday season to everyone.  Regards, CPH  P.S. Simon...I feel sooooooooo muchhhh better now...lol"
415254,buckster,2009-12-25 02:32:00,530,"Steve,  next time just wait on the shoulder untill the turkeys cross the road!    Good going on the perch wish i could have joined you... Hopefully next time!"
415263,Beans,2009-12-25 03:02:00,3339,There now...aren't you glad you lost that 100 pounds...  You would have needed at least six inches of ice...just kidding pal...  Glad to hear you did well...
415266,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-25 03:13:00,2582, Lotsa winter left... I sure hope we can hook up. I got a pail lined and ready to go if I do get out with you and the big guy.
415267,Sinker,2009-12-25 03:17:00,8692,Atta boy Steve!! I'm jealous!!!  S.
415268,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-25 03:17:00,2582, Thx beansie. Unfortunately a good portion of the 97LBS I lost has somehow found its way back home to roost  I'm hoping 2010 will see me getting back on track.  Get prepared for cherry tomato and cut up cauliflower snacks over at Carp Point this summer
415283,bigugli,2009-12-25 04:15:00,6138,Thanks for making me drool. Feels good to find that hot bite. Hope this warm front doesn't screw up the ice too much.
415599,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-27 01:17:00,2582,"Thought I would bump this just in case someone was considering a trip to Couch tomorrow. Please note that the ice conditions I mentioned where from Thursday BEFORE all this mild weather and rain.  Someone mentioned on the Simcoe Board about heading for Couch in the morning. I hope no one does, cause I can't imagine it will be safe now.  Patience people...lotsa winter left."
415719,limeyangler,2009-12-27 17:06:00,5204,"Fantastic Steve!  Sounds like an action packed 3 hours....was laughing out loud about ""something about xmas eve  "", full credit for pulling yourself away....i would have struggled to do that.  Well seemed like a long time coming...but glad you're feeling better....lol....its a killer waiting eh?  Looking forward to more reports....you either need to remember to take your camera or buy one   Best wishes for the new year  Simon"
415776,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-27 21:18:00,2582, Very rarely take the camera Simon. As a matter of fact I have my first memory card in it still with fish pictures  from 2005 when I got the camera  Beansie tried to encourage me one time and even showed me how to do everything to post pics on here....I guess it's just not in me.  But I do really enjoy the efforts others like yourself make with pictures and video's...so keep em coming.  Best wishes to you and your family as well Simon.
