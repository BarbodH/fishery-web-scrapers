414459,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2009-12-22 14:48:00,0,cool song.  i do a fair bit of home recording myself.  what type of software/gear do you use?
414464,irishfield,2009-12-22 14:57:00,26272,Thanks Cliff !! Told you it was better....  Now I wonder if it gave me enough spirit to bash thru the mall today !! lol
414475,fishnsled,2009-12-22 15:13:00,3520,"Very nice Cliff!   Sitting here are work, while listening to you play and wishing I had some rum and egg nog.  That would get me in the spirit!  lol!"
414498,ccmtcanada,2009-12-22 15:52:00,7971,"Thanks everyone!  I think I'm going to to a Christmas CD for next year...taking advanced orders now...LOL.    I use my band's PA...a Yamaha M810 for recording.  I will only use condenser microphones now (they are sooo much more sensitive and captures the highs and lows much better than a regular microphone) and you need a powered head to use them.  I record into that ""vocal mic"" you see in the picture.  I use the output on the PA straight into the computer.  I've tried a bunch of commercial software packages before to record, but I always go back to the one shown on the screen here...it's free...and downloadable on the net.  It's called Audacity.  Simple to use and has great results.  "
