415805,rbaquial,2009-12-27 23:39:00,968,"Hey Folks,  I tried checking the REG's and the BOARD but couldn't find any information regarding DUFFINS. So, my question is....  I'm thinking of hitting the park by HWY2...Am I ok to fish NORTH of HWY2? Or should I only be fishing SOUTH of it ONLY?? Or is it only CERTAIN times of the year, I can ONLY fish SOUTH of HWY2?  I apologize ahead of time... I couldn't find information on this... My ""Google"" skills are failing me a lot lately!!"
415807,tibbs,2009-12-27 23:42:00,650,You can fish south of HWY. 2 until Dec. 31  After Dec. 31 you can only fish south of the CNR tracks.
415808,rbaquial,2009-12-27 23:43:00,968,  Thanks Tibbs.... Anything biting this time of year around MOUTHS of RIVERS??... Thinking of going to the mouth of that river now...
415810,tibbs,2009-12-27 23:47:00,650,"I haven't been out for a while now, but the mouth of the creek might be frozen over.  Good Luck tomorrow!!!!"
415814,rbaquial,2009-12-28 00:07:00,968,Hopefully it isn't... with all the 0 and + weather over last 2 days.  Thanks!
415821,Paully,2009-12-28 00:36:00,712,"I drove over duffins creek at kingston and it was brown as far as the eve can see.. good luck, your gonna need it."
415826,Joeytier,2009-12-28 00:50:00,3990,You'd be better off hitting one of the smaller tributaries in the area if you're thinking of going tomorrow.  Duffins will be washed out until Tuesday at the earliest.
415829,danjang,2009-12-28 00:55:00,148,I went to the smaller eastern tribs this afternoon and caught 3. It was really high muddy with around 3-4 inches of visibility. Tomorrow should be perfect! To bad I won't be down there
415831,rbaquial,2009-12-28 01:08:00,968,Do you guys think the mouth would be frozen or no? I would think no... just cause of the 'somewhat' warmer weather lately...  What do you think?
415898,Dozer,2009-12-28 03:53:00,896,Slow moving water will be frozen over.  I think the warmer weather might trigger a feeding frenzy?
415992,fishermccann,2009-12-28 15:16:00,655,Down at the Rouge River last night  it was moving fast with lots of mud and logs going by. Petticotte  creek behind my house is above normal and moving fast this morning.
