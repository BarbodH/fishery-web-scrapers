411736,Gerritt,2009-12-14 02:29:00,6129,Niiiiiiice!
411751,discophish,2009-12-14 03:33:00,392,That was awesome!  Thanks for the talent show and the dedication.
411775,b2kptbo,2009-12-14 12:47:00,1505,"Thanks Cliff, very cool..."
411790,MJL,2009-12-14 14:01:00,2427,Amazing Cliff...Supreme talent to the max  Simply beautiful
411791,ccmtcanada,2009-12-14 14:02:00,7971,"Thank you everyone...just another hobby of mine!  Glad you guys are enjoying it!  Maybe another less complicated one in the works...   PM me your email address again Joey...I will send the mp3 to you!  Thanks a lot!    Same as Joey...if you want the actual MP3, just PM me your email address...I have it somewhere, but that saves me from digging it up.  Thanks Roy.   Check your inbox later today for the MP3 Cliff!  If you want to share the video, just send them the youtube link...the video itself is almost 30 megabytes....too big to email.   Perhaps if I get a little time I will do a little something with that song as well...if people are interested!   Glad you and your son liked the arrangement!  Very happy to hear your son is inspired by it...it's not all that difficult a song...   Beans...Sydney sorta helped!!   No doubt Jim....LOL"
411797,Spiel,2009-12-14 14:27:00,9065,That's absolutely beautiful Cliff.  I've always wished I'd learned to play something other than the stereo....  A Merry Christmas to you and yours.
411805,Headhunter,2009-12-14 14:55:00,5703,"Nice job Cliff! Here's my favorite version of the song, which BTW, is my personal favorite Xmas song. He butchers it, but it's still funny as all h e double hockey sticks!  HH"
411831,blaque,2009-12-14 16:34:00,2419,The Trans Siberian Orchestra could use a guy like you!  Sounds great!  I just started the whole recording thing and im fumbling along with my new equipment slowly lol.  I bought a POD Studio UX2 (w/ podfarm) and im using Audacity to record  Any tips on the whole recording concept would be greatly appreciated dude lol  Going from pluggin into an amp to plugging into a PC is a little different for sure
411851,ccmtcanada,2009-12-14 17:55:00,7971," I don't play quite consistently enough to play with the Trans Siberian Orchestra...but thanks!! LOL.  I use audacity as well...it's a GREAT free program.  I've tried some of the other software packages, but I always go back to audacity.  For all the guitar work, I always record the sound that comes through the air from the amplifier, using a condenser microphone and a PA head that can power that mic.  From the PA, I go into the computer input.  For bass guitar I go straight from the bass into the PA (no amp) and into the computer.  If you dont have a PA or a condenser mic, then I guess it's straight into the computer all the time...but thats ok.  I find the sound is a bit more ""live"" the way I do it.  PM me the next time you start a project, I'll be glad to help you out a bit with recording technique depending on what you are putting down!"
411857,blaque,2009-12-14 18:05:00,2419," Cool , will do. I dont have a Mic or PA. I plug into this  using USB and basically the Podfarm software i use as a plug in to Audacity.  Tons of fun with amp and cab simulations , a wackload of effects etc etc....."
412690,icedude,2009-12-17 02:13:00,459,thought this day would never end--lol  would be remiss not to compliment you on your lastest achievement here  it is easy to get caught up in all the 'nasty incidents' of late and miss a fresh and creative seasonal message-dug the hat with the tree background  YES-caught the TSO (not to be confused with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra) at ACC last month  quite a treat for the eyes and ears   Have a good one bud!    you have a nice natural talent going there  ID
412799,Chris,2009-12-17 12:47:00,405,Awesome Cliff  Very enjoyable to listen to.
415323,Lostchild,2009-12-25 19:17:00,153,"Very well done! I love it!  A great tune to be played on Christmas for sure, so soothing!  Merry Christmas and thanks for posting this."
415453,douG,2009-12-26 16:23:00,2693,"The playing is good, Cliff, and the production is what makes this a real gem. Congratulations."
411600,ccmtcanada,2009-12-13 18:51:00,7971,"Thought I'd share a little project I have been working on.  It's a version of O Holy Night that I arranged and decided to record.  I play all the parts...you'll see acoustic and electric guitar, bass guitar, and I used a cheap 100 dollar keyboard to simulate the drums, strings and piano parts.  Hope you enjoy!  "
