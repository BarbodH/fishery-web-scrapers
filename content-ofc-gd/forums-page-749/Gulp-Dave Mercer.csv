And while I have started to use gulp and have about a half dozen different types myself during the show it occured to me that there is a lot of plastic garbage generated. Mine is all packed away for the year so I was wondering if the containers are recycleable or if Gulp has concerns over the amount of containers generated.  Maybe gulp could have a bulk filling station instead of all the conatiners, so you take your container in and fill it up....seems like a lot of waste to me  And no .....I am not a tree hugger"

415145,Roy,2009-12-24 19:43:00,13728,Do you have recycling at your house yet Matt? I throw my margarine/ice cream and everything else tubs in the bin. Maybe I should be saving those and getting them refilled at the grocery store?

With all the fishing  companies hopefully some will have conservation and recycling in mind. I think discarding plastic has reached the excessive point. I throw out all the rest as well and don't agree with that either.  Hmmm.....grocery store bulk refilling...not a bad concept  I'mHooked.....Gulp has nothing to do with Dave  other that he uses, advertises and promotes them. Which is good for him and gulp...both quality imo."
