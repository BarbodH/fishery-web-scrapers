Was looking at the Lowrance x 67 c ice machine. but there are none to be found in the country, BP says they don t carry them anymore and Lebarons don t have any, so i am wondering if any one has any good ideas on something that works relatively well in the winter, I have a Lowrance i use on the boat but i think it might not work too good on the ice , besides it would take me a day to get it off the boat . any help would be appreciated, and i think i am not into flashers,     the fishing kind anyway!"
