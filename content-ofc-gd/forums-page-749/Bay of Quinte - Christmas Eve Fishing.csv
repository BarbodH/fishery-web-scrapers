415450,Jeff_C,2009-12-26 16:17:00,50,"We hit the ice for a short fish on Christmas Eve morning. Everyone managed to catch some fish. Although the area that we were checking didn't seem to hold as many fish as some of the others that we have been to, we still managed to catch 10 walleye. We will be back out tonight.  So far the bite has been pretty decent.  We have caught fish all over the Bay. That is really good to see!  Jeff"
415455,Curtis,2009-12-26 16:29:00,83,How much ice is down there. My lake has almost a ft but i doubt you have that much..
415458,Terry,2009-12-26 16:45:00,14456,dang I wish BOQ wasn't so far away    nice going
415459,johnnyb,2009-12-26 16:47:00,3413,"Ahhh, c'mon Terry!  An hour to my house, then 2 hours to the Q.  Get down here, and I'll drive the rest of the way!!!"
415460,Jeff_C,2009-12-26 16:48:00,50,"That all depends on where you go.  Adolphus reach is open water.  Areas in the eastern end had anywhere from 1"" to 6"" depending on where you go.  The western end had anywhere from 3"" to 7"".  That said, we have had a lot of rain overnight and today, so the areas with less ice will be bad.  Hopefully the areas that had more will survive it.  I will be out this afternoon to see what is still safe.  Jeff"
415462,Radnine,2009-12-26 16:52:00,1538,  How's your liability insurance? Jim
415472,Jeff_C,2009-12-26 17:34:00,50,"Anything that was less than 6"" will be questionable for sure.  I don't give recommendations to anyone during the early ice as the conditions can change so rapidly.  I'll have a better idea after I go check it out tonight.  Jeff"
415503,Joeytier,2009-12-26 19:10:00,3990,"I'll be heading down to the Belleville area Tuesday.  Temps are supposed to cool off nicely before then, so would I be safe to assume that Big Bay should be safe and good to go for Tuesday?"
415558,Jeff_C,2009-12-26 22:28:00,50,"Probably, but use caution.  I will have a better idea by Monday if you want to send me an email.  Be safe...  Jeff"
415569,Joeytier,2009-12-26 23:07:00,3990,Will do. I'll shoot you a pm sometime Monday evening.  Thanks.
415761,ehg,2009-12-27 20:13:00,2666,Sounds like a good day on the ice Quinte has to be one of the best for size and numbers of fish.
415780,tibbs,2009-12-27 22:12:00,650,My uncle just moved near the Bay of Quinte.  Hopefully we can get out and give it a try this year.
