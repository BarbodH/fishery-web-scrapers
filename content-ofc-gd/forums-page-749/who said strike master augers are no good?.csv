415485,Carp,2009-12-26 18:20:00,1488,Very impressive Ron.  We use a Jiffy 10 inch auger and it has been excellent for about 25years. Still going strong and the only thing we do is mix the fuel and go.

415876,azebra,2009-12-28 02:39:00,168,"oooh whatever, do you neet 0 holes in 60 seconds? besides the goof left the guard on the bladde so, the old guy saying ""as soon has he pulls it its gunn go in the ice 6 inches with one hand, then the thing didnt even start after 5 6 7 pulls...ugh"
415882,Handlebarz,2009-12-28 02:53:00,3790,  I think they do this to get the motor warmed up that way when he goes to cut the ice the it starts first pull. I would also think in comp they would be holding the throttle wide open so that its cutting right away there was not enough ice to do this for a quick demo.
