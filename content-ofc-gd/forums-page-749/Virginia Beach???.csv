415528,Joeytier,2009-12-26 20:02:00,3990,"I heard from someone just a day or two before Christmas that there was still lots of open water on the south shore.  I'm guessing after this mild spell with all the wind and rain, that there will be next no safe ice save for maybe Cook's Bay, and I'm sure it's dicey even in there.  Maybe I'm wrong."

415623,Terry,2009-12-27 03:00:00,14456,"I hears there were lots out there walking and fishing  one skidoo way out there, might be a little early for that and a Wilcraft so it looks pretty good for the walkers"
