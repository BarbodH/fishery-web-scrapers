415240,Dutch,2009-12-25 01:01:00,831,"Police and fire have been more prevalent on the list due to overtime and and crazy arbitration decisons.  Provincial arbitrators awarded a select few fire services ""retention"" pay.  They were losing quality fire fighters to other services and professions (like EMT).  In order to retain the people in those jobs, pay was increased.  Unfortunately, ALL fire services wanted wage parity and when it came to collective bargaining time, the unions held out, but kept working.  Well, in a lot of cases, the collective agreements went to arbitration and they were awarded retention pay even though retention was not an issue.  The arbitrators reasoned that all fire professionals should get paid similarly across the province.  The smaller municipalities were essentially forced into paying ""big city"" wages.  Well, the police got hold of the same concept, but theirs is called ""recognition pay.""  They get certain increments depending on how many years they have been with the force.  The reasoning here was that if you pay people more, they are more likely to stay on longer and not retire as early, being able to train up and comers.  Thing is, they argued that oficers were retiring early, but they weren't.  Again, the decision came down in a large centre, by an arbitrator but was extended in many circumstances to police services across the province.  Don't know much about the nursing situation.  What I can say is that many of the people in the categories above make the list due to one thing - Overtime.  Overtime is a systematic problem in my opinion.  When people are making 20-50% of their base wage as overtime over the course of a year there is a problem - it just can't be healthly and points to a systematic problem that needs to be addressed by management.  Not sure why these people are working so much OT, but a lot are making more than their managers and even Chiefs, which is absurd.  Anyway, I'm not here to say if they are ""worth"" the money as I haven't done the job, but they are necessary and I appreciate the work they do."

415328,Rizzo,2009-12-25 19:37:00,4754,"some of these fireman who work the 7 shifts a month (i think that's how many it is) have worked with me on the side because they have so much spare time. At least the ones I have met are NOT exercising or waxing the truck at 3 a.m.! They sleep. And they are clearly motivated people because they have a 2nd job on their days off! Personally, I would not want someone trying to save my family if they've been up over 24 hours. I fail to see any advantage to this system, other than the employee who gets to sleep on the job and have 20-something days off a month. Due to the risk of the job they should definitely be compensated well, but doesn't being awake more than 24 hours make a risky job even more risky?"

Also have you noticed how all the ticket collectors are really old? If your were being paid 100k to be a Customer Service Rep, a ticket taker, you'd hold onto that job until you die, doesn't make sense why they make that much, we don't pay the guy selling tickets at the movie theater a fifth of that.

Of course the pension looks good now but its probably unsustainable like most pensions. The old vs young ratio is just way too skewed and since I'm still under the age of 30 who knows what retirement will look like when I'm around 60+ years. I suspect I will more than likely being paying into a plan that won't pay out much to me but rather supports those already retired.  These lists are good and bad, like most things some are worth every penny they make and work hard for their money and some just make you shake your head. Alot of these guys as mentioned like the token book guys at TTC need to retire as you can bring in a lot more affordable labour for what I assume is a fairly unskilled job."

They have a list on whom to call first for OT. This list is ranked by seniority Most of the top 10 are workers and booking countless hours of OT.

414911,Dutch,2009-12-24 01:31:00,831,"I'm surprised at the support in this thread for the sunshine list.  Some people on there deserve what they make and others don't, but rest assured many of the jobs on there require a lot of hours and education.  For someone that has experience in both the public and private sector, you would be astonished at the salaries in the private sector at both small and large companies, thing is, there's no sunshine list there.  People would be outraged, especially if those people were being paid with ""my money"" or ""my taxes.""  Thing is, since the sunshine list came about in the mid '90's, the threashold has been $100,000.  Who came up with that number - it may have been a lot back then, but it is outdated.  By applying simple math and looking at the rate of inflation since inception the $100,000 becomes somewhere around $140-$150K in ""today's"" dollars.  For those that complain about how much these people make - walk a mile in their shoes, go back to school and get and education, work all those years to get the proper experience to get a job like the ones on the list, and put in the hours it takes to do the job.  Then say those on the list aren't worth it.  Maybe, just maybe, then your comments would be valid."

Every firetruck has a captain & crew with the captain being in charge. They stay together and work as a team under the direction of the senior officer in charge of everything.
