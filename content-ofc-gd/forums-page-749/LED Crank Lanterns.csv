415597,crappieperchhunter,2009-12-27 01:12:00,2582,I am looking into an LED crank lantern for night fishing. I have a crank radio for tunes and I love it. 200 cranks gives me an hour of music on the ice... longer on the front porch at the cottage during the summer.  I am not an all nighter on the ice. 60-90 minutes tops for the evening bite would pretty much be all I would use it for. Or maybe a few times in the spring for smelting off the pier.  My concern with the lantern is how bright there are or how long they last and of course if they perform in the cold. If anyone has any experiences with these...good or bad...I'd like to know.  I have a good Coleman naptha lantern but it is just too much of a PITA for ice fishing.  Thx all for any help.

I would charge it up before I went out, and use the crank after that. It is made by Noma and comes with the A/C charger.Guess I would say that I am happy with it. I did install 12 volt lighting, with a gel cell battery into my permanent hut and find that far better. They are still available at CTC, as I saw them there not to long ago.  Hope that helps  Don"
