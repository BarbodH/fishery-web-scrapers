415825,Kerry,2009-12-28 00:47:00,383,"I heard about 5"" of ice so far.With the wet weather the last day and a half I'd be wearing a floater suit for sure and using a spud to test as you go out.I haven't been out there yet to see it for myself. Be cautious if you're going. Kerry"
415870,gone_fishin,2009-12-28 02:35:00,481,"i was out there yesterday... had one small fish up to the hole and it came off, probably a little hammer handle. that was it for the day... didn't have any minnows though. ice was anywhere from 2-6 inches. water on top of the ice was anywhere from 0-5 inches. should be nice and solid by tuesday though!"
