Any one know if i need plates or insurance if im just using the thing on ice?? Before you ask my budget is under 1K thus a mid 80's 3 wheeler is about my only option!!! do the ministry officers ask for any papers for the the quad you ride on the ice, and finally most of the used stuff out there dont have any ownership literature anymore will that be an issue for me?  Thanks in advance for your help, also for good Karma sake if you have a quad for under a grand I will buy it and speak highly of your generosity to the masses...  Jason"

I don't think too many Insurance companies will touch them either.  Riding on your own property, no problem, anywhere else, don't think so.  As for being asked for reg and ins, yes the ministry does ask, checking for stolen ATVs/Snowmobiles.  It may be a whole lot cheaper to go with an older snowmobile, they can be had for $1K or less."
415953,Terry,2009-12-28 12:51:00,14456,I think fisherman is right  if you owned one for years you can still ride them but if you buy one you can not license it therefore you can ride it anywhere but your own property

I found out the  hard way!  2  years ago  stopped by a CO on  Simcoe - $245.00  fine &  if you're not wearing  your helmet  another $110.00 fine."
415984,motion,2009-12-28 14:46:00,403,"Bassassin, you may want to rethink the whole three wheeler thing. I was like you, looking to spend a grand or less and the only way to go was an 80's three wheeler. I took one out on the snow and almost instantly got stuck. I ended up buying a four wheel drive ATV and it still is dicey out there when there is snow. You will need an ownership and insurance if you move it off your own property."
415987,Dara,2009-12-28 15:03:00,3052,"License, ownership, insurance, trail permit, every time out for every officer that spots you.  Papers please."
