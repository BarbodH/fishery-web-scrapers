402991,bigfish1965,2009-11-17 02:44:00,3382," Waiver or not, we would have to get legal counsel before we could endorse it. Of course, what you guys wanna do on your own is up to you But an 'official' endorsement would require some thought..but we have lots of time. You may do well to talk to the guys doing the Twoonie Series."
403004,ctdd2006,2009-11-17 03:21:00,531, I'd consider hosting and partially sponsoring an event somewhere b/w sudbury and the soo!
403291,danbouck,2009-11-18 01:17:00,4380,  I think it was canceled this year.
403380,BassAsin,2009-11-18 06:26:00,806,"definately a good idea but the locations are gonna have to be spread out a bit, the names thrown out are all 4-10 hour drives for me and i can imagine the guys in kenora and dryden and the northern parts would feel left out if they're all held in southern ontario."
403387,Radnine,2009-11-18 11:34:00,1538, Congratulations! We support your lifestyle decisions. Oh!...game. Never mind. Jim
403390,Marc Thorpe,2009-11-18 11:58:00,621,Doesn't OFC all ready have an online competitive event involving all those who wish to enter in a team?
403392,lew,2009-11-18 12:11:00,12766,"One way you could include everybody would be to make it an on-line tournament rather than having everybody meet up at a certain body of water.  Set a date & a species and then folks could fish wherever their located in the country, or even south of the border, then post pictures of their catches with the size of the fish.  We did this type of tourney for muskies twice a few years back and it actually ran very smoothly. Course you have to trust folks to submit the proper weights for fish, but normally if there's no cash or prizes for the winner.....just bragging rights.....things usually go pretty good.  It's just a thought, but with our members spread over 2 countries it would be impossible to have tournies that included everyone who wanted to participate"
403400,bucktail,2009-11-18 12:39:00,1857,Carried a week over to next year so I am game for at least a few! Do all participants have to be members? Can I bring my buddy KVD in?
403470,BassAsin,2009-11-18 16:16:00,806,there are a lot of tournies set up like that you have to have one person setting up the tourny give a random number eg. 45673989 and that would have to be in the picture with the date on a piece of paper to know it was caught that day as the number isnt given out till till that morning.  then you have to trust that everyone is honest about the weight as for fish like musky and pike they usually go by length
403471,BassAsin,2009-11-18 16:17:00,806,have you smiled in the past week jim?
403480,lew,2009-11-18 16:26:00,12766," The tournies we fished, we were told the day before to hold a certain object in the picture....which is just to keep folks honest....but it's the same idea.  Ever try to hold a 4' musky while balancing a basketball on yer head ??"
403492,BassAsin,2009-11-18 16:52:00,806,balancing the basketball is easy i have trouble catching that 4' musky is all hahahah
415072,mbac31,2009-12-24 15:02:00,904,Some very good ideas. I have some stuff drawn up and will have time over the holidays to put everything together. Mods if you want to jump in here to give me suggestions or approval.

401784,mbac31,2009-11-12 23:07:00,904,Just boucing some ideas out there for a Tournament series for OFC Members. I was wondering how many guys would like to have a series say like 4 or 5 tournaments . $50 maybe for 2 anglers. Have a classic depnding on the amount of interest and with the blessing of the higer ups.    This is very prliminary right now but I could set something up if this generates enough interest. Please post ideas if you have them.
401796,MCTFisher9120,2009-11-12 23:38:00,3761,"I wouldn't be able to go to all events(depending of course) but my friend and I were both liking the idea of pro/am tourny's, but this might be a good series if all goes well.  Take this serious, if it were Scugog or Rice, perhaps Balsam or Couching I can and would be there, no big boat for me but hey it would do the job.   At this time in the forum's life I think it can be done.  I'm In, MTBF"
401797,danbouck,2009-11-12 23:40:00,4380,I would be in but there may be some issues with it that the mods wouldn't want to deal with.
401798,ozaibak1,2009-11-12 23:41:00,401,"I'd definitely be up for it as I'm sure many board members would be as well. It would bring together a lot of members that don't make it to the G2G's I would imagine. Wouldn't be able to make it to all 5 that's for sure, probably one or two though. I'm sure the board admins have thought about running board tourney's before, would be interested to know their thoughts about it."
401800,BIG FISH,2009-11-12 23:41:00,54,i would enter ... of course one of them would have to be on the bay of quinte
401801,mbac31,2009-11-12 23:43:00,904,"Dont need a big boat or anything like that. Just a series, restricted of course that is open to all on OFC. Local lakes would be chosen by OFC members in a polling section and depending on how many tournaments chosen we would then pick the top ones for that amount. It would be a Pro/Am style maybe. Guys would go in as boaters and others would be drawn as non boaters. That way cheating is basically eliminated. Just an idea"
401806,mbac31,2009-11-12 23:46:00,904,Mods feel free to add to this if I'm stepping out of bounds here let me know. This would take alot of organizing but can be done from this early. Pre registration would be a given.
401807,mbac31,2009-11-12 23:48:00,904,Does not have to be 5 tournaments thats just a number I thrw out there. Might be a 4 tournament ir three but would have to fish a certian amount.
401891,spinnerbaitking,2009-11-13 03:25:00,1622,Could be a lot of fun Richard
401896,pike slayer,2009-11-13 03:58:00,1177,great idea but i'm probably to far north to enter
401901,Sinker,2009-11-13 04:07:00,8692,"Make it multi species, and I'd do it.  Go with the seasons. Perch derby first, then crappies, then walleye, musky, bass..................etc. I think multi species makes for a much more rounded angler. I don't do bass at all, but I can catch all the rest pretty good   S."
401928,Harrison,2009-11-13 13:28:00,2202,"Like Sinker said,  Smaller boat waters, centralized.  perch/crappie in April (cooks bay only) Roaches boundry Pike in may - Canal/ cooks bay / ? Walleye in early june -  Rice / Scugog / ? Bass in July - Cameron / Scugog / ? Classic Bass/Walleye combo in Sept. - Tri lakes / Quinte (Bay only)  Just a couple ideas."
401957,Matt15,2009-11-13 15:13:00,107,Sounds like a great idea
401959,hotrod,2009-11-13 15:24:00,103,"Insurance issues are the biggest stumbling block to these kind of tournaments, I'd look into that first. You don't want to be liable if there is a mishap and I don't imagine the board does either.  I wish you good luck  ."
402000,mbac31,2009-11-13 19:25:00,904,Insurance is not an issue. Guys will have to sign a waiver that all parties involved including OFC are not liable. Guys will have to have insurance on their rigs regardless. Thats a given on the water  right now as well as obeying all rules and haveing the boaters card is mandatory.
402002,basskicker09,2009-11-13 19:38:00,144,im also on a local board and they do tones of little tournies like this a waver is a must so no one gets sued and its always better if everyone is able to compete because there are lots of amazing anglers out there that cant afford a huge boat to fish big waters and multi species is always a good way to go i would be interested
402024,steverowbotham,2009-11-13 22:01:00,1800,im game
402039,vinnimon,2009-11-13 23:26:00,2593,Sign me up please.
402098,Frenchie,2009-11-14 02:44:00,4,Sounds like a great idea .. I would certainy be interested ..
402216,Guest buick14,2009-11-14 23:04:00,0,"I think its a great idea, could be really fun.....could also have a separate every man/women for themselves shore fishing tourney at the same time judged separate for those who are used to slamming fish from shore...  keep me posted on this topic, I'm very interested!"
402245,jaydub,2009-11-15 00:54:00,145,Sounds great to me!  Sounds like a lot of work for the organizers though if your talking about 4 or 5 tourney's with weigh in stations.  One idea to try and appeal to people that enjoy targeting certain species is to have a prize for the largest fish of several species instead of having species specific tourneys.  I was in a tournament this fall that ran like that and it works great providing you get good participation.  This would also facilitate having each tourney in a different geographical location so that most people that want to participate can without having to travel too far.
402885,mbac31,2009-11-16 23:43:00,904,Some real nice ideas. Like the ones with the different species.
402894,fish-miester,2009-11-16 23:56:00,864,Beauty idea!
