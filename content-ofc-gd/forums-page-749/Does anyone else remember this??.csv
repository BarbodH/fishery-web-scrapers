415500,danc,2009-12-26 19:06:00,4677,I heard this song on the radio Christmas day and it brought back some memories. I don't think that I've heard it in a couple of decades. Does anyone else remember this one.   
415505,Terry,2009-12-26 19:16:00,14456,never heard it before
415510,Radnine,2009-12-26 19:38:00,1538,"I have never heard this one before but I have heard an Australian comic that did a song called ""Santa Clause You ... , You Forgot My ....... Bike!"". It was not very Christmassy at all if I recall correctly. Jim"
415522,danc,2009-12-26 19:54:00,4677,I've heard that one too Jim. Kevin ****** Wilson I think. Maybe I'm aging myself with the Six White Boomers song. I guess it had a profound effect on me when I was a kid. Surely someone else remembers it besides me though??
