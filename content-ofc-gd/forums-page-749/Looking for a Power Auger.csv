415395,Doctrt,2009-12-26 04:20:00,141,I got the greenlight on a new power auger for x-mas.  Now I just have to find one.  Any leads on good brands or deals.  I saw the one in the BPS flyer but not really impressed with the price.  Thanks in advance. T

415421,Garnet,2009-12-26 12:53:00,2056,Different ones for different jobs. I've used most brands owned 2 Jiffy 30 and now have Strike Master Lite.  The  Jiffy 30 is all metal so very good at taking a beating back country Atv travel ect. It's also heavier than sine.  The StrikeMaster Lite is 4 stroke and weights 20 lbs takes strait gas but I don't think it would take a beating and I will probably never get rid of it.  Very thing else falls between.
