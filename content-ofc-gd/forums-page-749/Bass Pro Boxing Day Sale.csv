415370,skeeter,2009-12-26 01:40:00,1907,try this http://toronto.flyerland.ca/view_flyer.php?flyer_id=14554
415371,GNODDY,2009-12-26 01:48:00,163,Thanks Skeeter
415372,Mattones,2009-12-26 01:49:00,587,"I was looking for that,  No good deals for me again this year"
415378,Fang,2009-12-26 02:37:00,1330,Really quite disappointing. Not that I was planning to brave Vaughan Mills mall on Boxing day (did it once and never again!!!)
415403,rbaquial,2009-12-26 07:31:00,968,  The ONLY good thing that EVER came outta that mall (aside from BASS PRO)... It gives all the LOCAL MILFS a place to CONGREGATE.
415404,ped,2009-12-26 09:05:00,16,lol
415424,knotaclue,2009-12-26 13:33:00,136,Iâ€™ll agree with that.
415426,Lunkerhunter,2009-12-26 13:51:00,455,"i went last year on boxing day, it was stupid busy. waited close to an hour to check out and they had every counter going.  i\d stay home and go another day"
415430,Rizzo,2009-12-26 15:02:00,4754,thanks skeeter. Doesn't look worth the line-ups/hassles of Boxing Day crowds for me
415431,Mattones,2009-12-26 15:04:00,587, Amen. Plus the ladies around 19+ I was almost   Lucky for me the girlfriend doesnt care if i look  She even points 'em out if i happen to miss one  I went lastyear and got there 15mins before they opened and found a good spot. This year with a new truck id stay away.
