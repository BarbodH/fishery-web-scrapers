Preparation....the brine.... turkey sits in this for 12 hours.... consists of apple juice, brown sugar, kosher salt, crushed garlic, sliced ginger, cloves, bay leaves, quartered and squeezed oranges....   The turkey is on....   Thar she be chuggin' away.....   I will keep the BBQ porn going as the cook progresses....  Burt"

415193,misfish,2009-12-24 22:04:00,29133,Yer a big tease.  YUMMY. Nice job.
415243,Dutch,2009-12-25 01:11:00,831,"Looks great.  What kind of wood you use?  Does the orange even out over the smoke, seems like it may overpower the flavour of the turkey?"
415253,Burtess,2009-12-25 02:10:00,901," I used a couple chunks of cherry.....  You really don't taste the elements of the brine separately, it just had a really good flavour, lightly smoked, but VERY juicy...  Burt"
