415658,fishinguypat,2009-12-27 05:39:00,547,go to the qew bridge ...there are deep holes and they are in there
415740,Joeytier,2009-12-27 18:20:00,3990,Everything's wide open and blown out today.  Best water I could find was still only 2 inches of vis. tops.  Tomorrow should be prime.
415742,tributaryhunter,2009-12-27 18:25:00,108,i was thinking the same aswell tom should be good thanks guys
415795,danjang,2009-12-27 22:52:00,148,Despite the maybe 4 inches of vis. I went 3/3 today. All 3 were nice and fresh! They were eastern tribs though.
415799,Fang,2009-12-27 23:21:00,1330,coming home just before dark today. 16 mile and bronte were high and very muddy - distinct sign of the red clay run off. The ice on the lower stretches is all gone but I'd think it'd be another day or so before fishable
