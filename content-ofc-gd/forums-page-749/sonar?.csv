If is for a boat, canoe, kayak, or a tube. You can find a customized sonar  for each mentioned craft. The trasducer also varies a lot based on craft type. If you have to mark tons of ""honey holes"" look for one with gps - waypoints."
415616,Gman,2009-12-27 02:41:00,126,"if you don't mind me asking, is the gift certificate enough to justify paying the higher price at BPS?  I would suggest giving Josh @ Angling Outfitters in Woodstock a chance before you decide. He will be able to help you decide which brand and model based on your fishing needs. His pricing, knowledge along with support will blow you away that despite your BPS certificate, depending on value, you may be better off buying from him.  He can be reached at 519-539-5494, and don't be afraid to tell him Gavin told you to call him   He's doing all the electronics on my boat this spring!  Cheers, Gman"
