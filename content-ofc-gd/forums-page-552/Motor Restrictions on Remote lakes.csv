572136,solopaddler,2011-04-14 14:07:00,8605, The only restrictions would potentially be in parks.

572156,SmokestackLightnin,2011-04-14 15:21:00,390," Not necessarily, here is a link to all the marine restrictions in Canada as noted on the Department of Justice Website:  http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2008-120/  It is accurate to March 22, 2011. It also provides lakes that have speed restrictions, restrictions to towing devices, etc. Hope it helps."
572164,solopaddler,2011-04-14 15:55:00,8605, Back lakes in the middle of nowhere surrounded by crown land have no restrictions.

572371,dhickey,2011-04-15 02:23:00,1038,just dont forget that back lakes are generaly small. the noise from you engine will most likely spook the fish and turn them off.  just my take on things.
572382,Dara,2011-04-15 02:39:00,3052,  Sometimes when the fishing gets slow we start the motor and idle it for a minute to stir things up and get the fish biting again. Even in winter we will run a sled around the holes.
572386,dhickey,2011-04-15 02:50:00,1038,ice fishing is completly different.  i do the same.  soft water on back lakes is a different game... stelth!! hint..
572399,atvaholic,2011-04-15 03:24:00,271,"Yeah, we do have a trolling motor. In a larger lake I will use the gas to get us to the general area, then use trolling motor. Smaller lakes are paddle or trolling motor only."
