The town of Hastings is the location of a free kids fishing day on May 28, 2011. This event will introduce new anglers and their families to the wonderful sport of fishing. OFAH Tackleshare will be loaning fishing equipment to any that may need and the event is part of the Rice Lake Fishing Festival. For more information on the festival visit the website.  http://www.ricelakes...ingfestival.ca/  Cast a vote for a great fishing community."

572012,Michael_Brown,2011-04-14 00:40:00,411,So I just checked and Hasting is the top voted town in central Canada but there are a couple of places in BC that are ahead in the voting. Now with the famous fishing in Rice Lake and the number of people who live around or near Rice Lake we should be able to beat anywhere in BC.  Thanks to those who have voted and you can vote once for each e-mail account you may have.  Come on OFC lets get Hastings the win.
