570550,scugpg,2011-04-09 21:11:00,1373,Hey guys where can I find shop vac type hose that its ast least 2 in and no bigger than 2.5 in?  I need 20 ft if possible. I can get an 10ft extension for my ridgid but it is almost 50 bucks which is crazy for just the hose.  Thanks.

570555,scugpg,2011-04-09 21:39:00,1373, No luck there unfortunately...closest was 1.5in sump hose...too small. Flexhaust would be perfect but the price is off the charts for around the house http://www.flexaust.com/smooth-interior-vacuum-hose
570556,irishfield,2011-04-09 21:41:00,26272,To Bad.. the PA in Barrie always had stuff like that.
570564,Fisherman,2011-04-09 22:00:00,7201,"Check and see if you have a Busy Bee tool shop around your area, they sell complete units or parts.  There is a store in London, check this maybe: http://www.busybeetools.com/products/HOSE-PVC-2-1%7B47%7D2IN.-CLEAR.html"

570646,pics,2011-04-10 01:39:00,1268,Maybe Flexible Technologies in near the Gateway postal sorting plant in Mississauga can help. Lots of different vacuum hoses in stock......I'm not sure they sell to the public but it's worth a try...
570727,scugpg,2011-04-10 14:05:00,1373, I'll give them a call to check thanks.

570785,NANUK,2011-04-10 18:21:00,797,Try places which deal with central vaccume systems.
570814,SlowPoke,2011-04-10 20:25:00,2984,"Rob, try calling Hose Headquarters in London. They're a block south of Heritage Marine. If they don't have it they might point you in the right direction; they're extremely helpful."
570865,scugpg,2011-04-10 22:56:00,1373, first place I called bud he didn't think he had anything other than the flexhaust which was around 100 for 25ft lol
570874,smally21,2011-04-10 23:26:00,993,"lee valley, or online from workshopsupply.com (woodstock)  still 25-30 per 10' length"
