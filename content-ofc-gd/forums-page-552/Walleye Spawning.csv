572287,Billy Bob,2011-04-14 22:02:00,5865, Pickerel look like small pike...you must mean Yellow Pike.
572303,mercman,2011-04-14 23:09:00,7054," What you are talking about are Chain Pickerel Bob.pickerel is Pickerel,Dore, Yellow Pickerel,.. How come i cant type pickerel? See, every time i type pickerel, it says pickerel"
572304,Billy Bob,2011-04-14 23:18:00,5865,  I know what a chain pickerel is...Canadian's call them grass pike....we catch them in Oneida Lake all the time while fishing for Yellow Pike (pickerel)....   Yellow Pike is a Buffalo nickname for pickerel because Lake Erie once had Blue Pike...
572328,Terry,2011-04-15 00:18:00,14456,thank you for the pickerel filter   someone has a good sense of homour
572437,Billy Bob,2011-04-15 10:21:00,5865,"You got that all correct expect ""Blue Pike"" WERE a cousin of the Yellow Pike...but a now extinct species."
