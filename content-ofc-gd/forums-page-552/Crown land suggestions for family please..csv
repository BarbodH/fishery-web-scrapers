Normally in the summer we head up around the Elliot Lake area where every other step is adequate crown land to camp on. With myself finishing up college I don't have the luxury of pulling off that trip on a regular basis anymore. If anyone could point me in the direction of adequate crown land within an hour and a half to two hours from Barrie I would greatly appreciate it. On a decent fishing like would be nice but I am not picky, I just want to get out for the weekend with my family. There needs to be enough room to park a tent trailer with a 12 foot box and my SUV. If you don't want to give away a decent spot on here feel free to PM me. I am not opposed to travelling to the Kawartha Lakes, but a general area to start with would be fantastic. Thank you."
572008,pics,2011-04-14 00:34:00,1268,There's some crown land near Crystal Lake north of Bobcageon along the fire access roads... Maybe someone in the area could give you more info.....
572026,RustyShackleford,2011-04-14 01:17:00,15,Thank you for your help. If anyone has any other info to share I would appreciate it.
572027,Governator,2011-04-14 01:26:00,879,"You can use the interactive crown land map from the government.  Takes a bit to get use to how to use it, it's also very slow but very accurate as you can zoom in very close:  http://crownlanduseatlas.mnr.gov.on.ca/"
572032,RustyShackleford,2011-04-14 01:42:00,15,"Ya, I have used the atlas in the past, its just so frustrating to use I just end up more confused than anything. I will take another stab at it though."

Good luck to ya though.  I'm a crown land camping guy myself, but I boat into almost all of my campsites.  If you can park the car, and access campsite by boat, that opens up a ton of spots."
572339,Tootsie II,2011-04-15 01:10:00,162,Just tried using that gov't of Ontario website. Looked at the areas where we go and virtually none of the roads we use are shown. Anybody else found this?
572540,RustyShackleford,2011-04-15 14:35:00,15,Well I know for a fact that a lot of the crown land that we use in the Elliot Lake area is mis labeled as either private or something else...so that doesn't surprise me.
