570901,Familyfisherman,2011-04-10 23:58:00,188,Just wondering if anyone's been down to Dunnville fishing for Cats on the grand?  Thinking of heading down later this week if it's worthwhile.  Thanks for any updates.  Excited to get started on the soft water
570903,Marko,2011-04-11 00:09:00,854,There was a report floating around from either today or yesterday.....i think two were caught.
570912,tibbs,2011-04-11 00:31:00,650, That would be my report. Here it is familyfisherman: Click Here
570954,landry,2011-04-11 02:00:00,1005,My buddy and I landed 5 up to 15 lbs. We lost 3 others and had quite a few bites but they were tough to hook. Water is still very cold. It is just the beginning of the run I think. It was definitely better in the hot afternoon sun. It is worth a trip but not at its peak yet. We fished from 11 - 5. Hope that helps. Landry  
570970,Familyfisherman,2011-04-11 02:49:00,188,Thanks very much guys -- and nice report and pics.  Hopefully things continue to warm up this week and we may give it a try next weekend!
570998,brifishrgy,2011-04-11 03:53:00,559," should be good for the long weekend, at least that's what I have planned"
571438,Fishmaster,2011-04-12 13:52:00,920,Fishing is picking up daily with the warmer temps ...been catching 6 to 10 in my 6 hour trips ...this weekend should be on fire...         
571624,fishinguypat,2011-04-12 23:54:00,547,I want to go this weekend also  but it is supposed to rain
571639,aplumma,2011-04-13 00:18:00,6896,A rising river is usually a very good bite for Catfish. Find the areas were the water is slowed by rip rap or logs in the river and you will find them balled up out of the current waiting for food to wash by.   Art
571912,Fishmaster,2011-04-13 19:34:00,920,Thats right rain bring in the Big Fat Cats one over 24lbs weighed in today ...And it wasn't to bad of a day for me and my clients today going 7 for 13 in 4 hours ...if you got good rain gear don't sit around waiting for sunndy days get out and slam the big cats Rian or Shine they will EAT ...wet day for pics but heres a couple ...I will be on the water the next 4 Days straight should have a full report on the Grand River Cats this weekend ...Fishmaster  Dam Nasty Lamprays  
572006,Fishmaster,2011-04-14 00:29:00,920,Even a better SLOB weighed in today James H. aka Fishlips 25.04 lbs 
572009,solopaddler,2011-04-14 00:38:00,8605,"Some impressive fish for sure. Considering I live so close it's ridiculous I've never fished for them.  On a side note, just curious, do people keep those giant catfish?"
572014,vinnimon,2011-04-14 00:43:00,2593,"  Give it a shot one day with the kids, its a blast!No comparison to trout fishing, but its fun....."
572020,solopaddler,2011-04-14 01:03:00,8605,  My boat's in storage 7 hours north of Hamilton.  I'm guessing shore fishing would suck.
572022,vinnimon,2011-04-14 01:10:00,2593,  So see ya in 14hrs then
572058,HTHM,2011-04-14 03:04:00,4082,Actually shore fishing does not suck. A lot of big cats are caught off the shore by Fishmasters. Give 'er a go.
