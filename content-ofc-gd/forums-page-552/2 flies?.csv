571156,fishin jesus,2011-04-11 18:50:00,53,i've watched a few video's of guys Fly fishing using 2 flies at the same time. The guy was running a 2 foot line tied from his first fly ( Wooly bugger) and he had a smaller Stonefly  running as his 2nd fly off the bottom ./ Looks like it could be quite productive  does anyone know if that is a legal tactic in Ontario?.....I'm tending to think it is but I need some re assurance.
571159,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-11 18:54:00,10439,The only places it would not be legal is on single hook designated waters.
571161,Oggie,2011-04-11 19:08:00,588,"Not legal on the Grand River in the special regulation sections around Fergus/Elora. ""Single barbless hook only"". Legal to have up to 3 hooks on your line any where else in Ontario, that's why many minnow imitations have 3 trebles (ie. Rapalas).  DAn O."

571178,Musky or Specks,2011-04-11 20:08:00,2710,"Crap I've uses a dry , an emerger and a nymph all on the same rig many times were its allowed. Bit of a panic with that rig in Labrador though as many times I would have two or more whitefish take the flies at the same time and end up with multiple feeesh on"
571183,irishfield,2011-04-11 20:18:00,26272," You're allowed 4 hooks per line in Ontario, unless specified elsewise as you pointed out on the Grand and Lake Nipigon would be another example."

571383,fishinguypat,2011-04-12 05:49:00,547,people do that with spawn sacs for steelhead when in deeper water
571429,fishin jesus,2011-04-12 13:14:00,53,[thanks gang !!!	my first run through a pool this year will  have a black Wooly bugger up top........black Stone fly running right off the bottom !!!  sounds great in theory.............but anyone that knows me will be wondering long long before I'm tangled up or hung up in a tree branch !!
571752,camillj,2011-04-13 04:10:00,1988,Personally I do it the other way .... Magog smelt ... chasing a beadhead woolly Buggar .. chasing a small montreal dark ... and being the competitors that they are youd be surpised how often its the front fly that gets hit (especially in wild speck waters)
