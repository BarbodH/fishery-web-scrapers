There tends to be conflicting sources on a few issues, so I thought I would bring the conversation to OFC:  -  After a long day on the water, will your stripping finger become sore and raw from the constant abrasion on the line?  Some reviewers stated their fingers nearly fell off, others said this was complete Bull.  What do you guys think?  - do the micro pores on the line hold dirt more than regular (non-textured) lines?  Again, some reviewers claim that dirt doesn't easily splash off, others claim it is Bull.  - A review I read claimed that the micro pores ""held on"" to air bubbles, thus increasing the lines floatability, but according to the reviewer, once the line drifts through rough water, the line actually sinks more than standard SA lines.  Any experience with this?  - Does anyone notice an actual improved difference in castability?  Thanks in advance for any clarifications, OFC."

He has been running the lines for 3 years now and swears by them. All of his loaner rods are lined with them and after 3 years of hard use they are still in excellent shape. Other lines he has used in the past had to be replaced at the end of the year as they were worn out. He says they cast very well and are excellent mending lines. I'll take mine out for a spin when the ice finally goes out late next month."
