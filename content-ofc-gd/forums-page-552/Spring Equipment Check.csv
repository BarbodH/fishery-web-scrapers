571826,Fisherman,2011-04-13 13:28:00,7201,"Just about that time of year, everybody is getting itchy to get the boat in the water.  Time for a little pre launch check.  I took the old battery to Wally world yesterday morning, load check please I said to the mechanic.  He plugged it in to the meter and the printout says, 434/500Amps, not bad for an 8 year old battery,(dated D-3), 87% and that's at about 4C so it would come up a bit when it's warmer.  Check engine oil, lower unit oil full, new fuel filter.  Front and rear lights on the boat work, check safety kit, make sure it's all there. Drain plug in the hole.  Paperwork, licence and ownership in the waterproof box.  2 new tires for the trailer, the others were almost 7 years old and showing signs of cracking.  Bearings okay.  Go around the trailer with a couple of wrenches and make sure all the nuts and bolts are tight.  Check trailer lights, nothing worse than following some nimrod in the dark that has little or no lighting.  And the worst part, having to fill the tank $$$."
571827,skeeter,2011-04-13 13:33:00,1907,Did you jack up the trailer wheels and give them a spin and shake to check the bearings?
571829,lew,2011-04-13 13:37:00,12766,And be absolutely certain that the lug wrench for your truck will also fit the lugs on your trailer.....cause they often don't.
571831,12footspringbok,2011-04-13 13:49:00,459,Already seen one launch ramp outboard diagnoses/trouble shoot saturday....   Atleast they got out of the way so we could put the boat on the trailer
571835,Fisherman,2011-04-13 14:11:00,7201,"Oh ya, the trailer sits on small jackstands all winter in the garage, tires off the cement, I give them a spin every now and then."
571839,Nipfisher,2011-04-13 14:16:00,2449,Don't forget LIFE JACKETS.
571848,Dondorfish,2011-04-13 14:38:00,1000,Don't forget to check / change the batteries in the flashlight in your safety kit. The flashlight MUST work - even for daytime fishing trips.  Tracker (Don)
571868,mercman,2011-04-13 16:17:00,7054,"As mentioned dont forget to put the drain plug in With the excitement of getting on the water,you must remain calm and methodical.I did forget last summer, and when i got back to the dock after parking my truck.......SUBMARINE !  "

571898,porkpie,2011-04-13 18:23:00,2521,"I just run a little 14 footer now, so gas is not an issue.  I do need to replace the float in my carb though, probably rebuild the carb too!!"
