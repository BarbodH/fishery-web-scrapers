570838,Lunatic,2011-04-10 21:52:00,536,"most coaches get to pick who works with them andits up to the gm to see that it works out that way.and the reason acton is hanging around for so long is he lucked out when wilson came,because they are buddies.  also a good mechanic never blames his tools."
570869,Jigger,2011-04-10 23:15:00,1237," As it stands now, Richards may be a good centre. But for an guy that has only ever broken the 90pt barrier twice to be called ""elite"" is laughable, and it would be hard to swallow the kind of contract he's going to demand. IMO Richards can say what he wants, I'd rather Burke not even go close to him with an offer sheet."
571088,Chance,2011-04-11 15:14:00,420,"My point exactly.Richards has said no to the Leafs so a boycott will make him change his mind,I think not? It is really business 101, you are claiming the Leafs organization cares about absolutely nothing but making money yet then claim they pass up on the biggest money maker available,the playoffs.This myth has been around for years and its just that a myth. Exactly what points to a lack of interest in making the playoffs?Does the brass come into the room when they are in ninth place and say""hey boys time to toss up a dog we are not interested in making the playoffs""? ""if one of you buggers scores the winning goal that puts us in those playoffs yor gone the next day! ""If there is no incentive to win and as you say fans come in droves why not ice a bunch of ECHL players and sit 20 million below the cap every year?Nope the Leafs currently are approxiomately 5 million below cap.They sign a goalie for 6+Mil a year instead of ""buddy whatshisname"" form the ECHL for 10 G's and a case of beer. Why sign Brian Burke stay with ferguson,he's cheaper,heck you could probably sign a GM from junior for 50k a year. Try living the life of a pro.Breathe eat sleep hockey and all that it encompasses since you were a kid.Think of nothing but scoring the winning goal in the stanley cup final.Then once your in reach of your goal just magically change your whole outlook on life and stop competing. Poor coachiong,lack of talent,poor scouting sure I buy into it all,but no incentive to win,not a chance.Blaming the Leafs or any teams lack of success on attendance is to say the least humourous.  "
571097,craigdritchie,2011-04-11 15:36:00,1586,"Yes, playoff games would earn the team a lot of money, and yes, a Stanley Cup win would represent enormous business in merchandise alone. No one argues that.  But one thing you learn in Business 101 is that there are two sides to any profit opportunity. Investing to develop a winning team also represents a certain level of risk, and one that the owners do not appear to be willing to take. It isn't just the cost of signing some marquis players and maybe paying a salary cap penalty. You're looking at the cost of investing in the farm system, investing in better coaching at the minor league levels, investing in scouting, and building depth throughout the franchise over a span of five, six, maybe eight years. You're talking tens of millions of dollars with absolutely no guarantee that the team will go on to actually win anything.  It's a gamble, and investors don't like to gamble. They prefer to maximize the return on their investment while minimizing risk.  Leaf owners are already making very nice profits as it is. Their attitude is, why risk a fortune when you don't have to?  I agree with FishGreg - nothing will change as long as people continue to buy jerseys and hats and keep shoveling money into the organization, basically rewarding them for doing nothing."
571116,Chance,2011-04-11 16:24:00,420," what you speak of is a disfunctonal infrastructure which I will agree with.Pre cap days the leafs did not worry about scouting,developement or anything less.They purchased other teams top players as they had the money to do such.Now with the cap in place these things are important and you cannot buy anything without penalties in place.The machine is broken ,no doubt about it but not for lack of interest in making money. I think you might be stretching the ""tens of millions"" risk factor.They sit fifth in AHL payroll,not last,not first but not last.Check on the salaries of eakins and their scouts.They do invest money but once again lack of talent comes into play. Disfunctional yes but not willing to take a financial risk in the minor leagues...well lets just say i would love to see those numbers.  Which represents are greater financial risk.Spending building a solid foundation in the minors or throwing millions at the final product in hopes it works??"
571122,craigdritchie,2011-04-11 16:40:00,1586,"Chance - I would like to see the actual numbers too, but obviously that isn't going to happen for either of us. Sadly, I don't sense that the owners are interested in either investing in building the farm system, or throwing significantly more money at the pro-level club. They seem perfectly happy with maintaining the present situation, and that's what I find most frustrating."
571127,moose,2011-04-11 17:05:00,266,Isn't this all Brian Burke said when he came to Toronto This is the hardest place in NHL to play because of media and bandwagon fans that put soccer in their handle in forums hahahah He still might be thinking of a field where it is too big When a guy gets touched and you think he was ru over by a freight train And looking for yellow and green cards Make feild shorter and put contact in As for hockey this a great game your team is not always going to win So if you don't enjoy it you can watch soccer or paint dry
571153,Chance,2011-04-11 18:47:00,420,"  I think,more so hope this is changing.This team ""seems"" to be heading in the right direction.It is alot younger than in years past and does have some good prospects on the way up.Hopefully they can pull it together and at least be competitive next year.If the last part of the season was an indicator they should be okay if they make a few changes."
571164,Oggie,2011-04-11 19:21:00,588,"Somebody in the second period Hot Stove roundtable discussion basically said What you're saying Craig. The Teacher's Pension Fund is not interested in spending as long as they are making profit.  One of the inside guys said that actually the TPF are excellent owners. They stay out of managements way and they don't question the spending. They're alot better than many other owners in other franchises he said.  I think there has been a long tradition of poor managment right back to the Ballard years.  Rookie GM's (Ferguson, Stellick, etc.) that didn't know what they were doing. Old coaches (Quinn) that didn't see the changes in the NHL coming and failed to retool there teams. Yes a general lack of spending on scouting and minor league system. All this has made for the Perfect Storm and the Leafs are just now starting to show signs of recovery.  Marquis players like to play for winning teams so no way Richards is coming here. GM's like to work in winning franchises so no way Scotty Bowman   would ever have come here.  Winning begets winning and VS VS.  It takes time to turn this thing around. Dan O."
571207,Jigger,2011-04-11 21:38:00,1237,"Just forlaughs, I'd just like to point out that the Presidents trophy was awarded this year to a team that Burke and Nonis built."
571273,Gregoire,2011-04-12 00:18:00,1397,"  You are totally missing my point, but that is not shocking. My point has been made and reinforced. We have a difference of opinion. I would just like you to think about how the owners of the leafs would react if the ACC did not sell out every day, or if merchandise sales fell off. I'd be willing to wager that they might change their direction. I also must say that I am highly suspicious of people who are blindly devoted to a cause. I find that their judgement becomes suspect. Chance, I think you may be experiencing this."
571674,Chance,2011-04-13 01:09:00,420,"Yes you have stated your point of view but proven it to be accurate or reinforced it with facts....no. Your point as I see it is they are happy raking in the dough they are at this point and absolutely no incentive to improve and possibly enter the playoffs.My point is this is not so and they are trying to improve,dysfunctionaly so as they do not have alot of talent in the ranks but an attempt non the less.Brian Burke has more control than any GM in the past and this was one of his stipulations before he signed.He immediately went after one of the top scorers in the league (lets not get into the kessel sucks discussion ,whether you like it or not he is near the top when it comes to putting the puck in the net).He attempted to move up in the draft and now has one of the youngest teams in the league.He is trying to attract big name players who do not want to come for many reasons,wilson the media etc etc etc. What exactly would they do differently if fans stopped showing up??Learn how to build a team from the ground up?Sign a big first line center,sign two players who can actually kill penalties,sign a decent PP point man,hire a dynamic coach who can adjust on the fly?Or possibly throw huge amounts of money at marquis players who would attract fans but not win you a cup, or in other words what they have been doing for years.You can stop petting your old dog but this doesn't mean he is going to learn any new tricks to get your attention back. I believe they are heading in the right direction.It will take time and they are still making mistakes. As far as blind devotion is concerned,which one of my previous quotes leads to that belief? """"Poor coaching,lack of talent,poor scouting sure I buy into it all"" or was it ""the machine is broken"" or possibly when I said they had a ""dysfunctional infrastructure""?     "
570075,lhousesoccer,2011-04-08 00:47:00,442,"Let me preface this by saying ""I'M A LEAFS FAN. ALWAYS HAVE BEEN, ALWAYS WILL BE"".  Ok, now that I have that out of the way, I wanted to repost this article I read on the MSN sports page today.  Let the debate begin.  Is this guy right?  Or is he way off base?   Why the Toronto Maple Leafs won’t be an NHL powerhouse for at least five years  Another NHL season, another year without any playoff games for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Despite an infusion of excellent goaltending from rookie James Reimer and a valiant team effort after the all-star break, a miserable first half was just too much for the Leafs to overcome. Their playoff absence now stretches to six seasons and seven years thanks to the lockout. Certainly there have been signs of promise from the team's core youngsters and a few tweaks could easily get them into the dance next year, but their long Stanley Cup drought is still years away from being lifted. The following is what still ails the blue and white and what prevents them from being a perennial powerhouse.  Draft Schmaft It's been proven time and time again that good teams build through the draft. Sure, the New York Islanders' brass will tell you that there are no guarantees, but looking at upper-echelon teams like the Pittsburgh Penguins, Chicago Blackhawks and Washington Capitals should have been strong enough evidence to entice the Leafs to keep their top draft picks. Even teams like the Philadelphia Flyers and Anaheim Ducks have built the foundations of their organizations through lower first-round selections. Instead, the Leafs have given up picks which have been used to draft the likes of Scott Niedermayer, Roberto Luongo and super-rookie Logan Couture. Not to mention the two first-rounders relinquished for Phil Kessel.  Banking on free agency Because the Leafs have largely been resistant to holding onto high draft picks, the franchise has adopted the mantra, as general manager Brian Burke says, ""July 1 will be our draft."" Overall, that strategy hasn't worked for teams in the past - see New York Rangers - and because teams tend to lock up their young talent, which they draft, the chances of it working now are slim to nil. Last year the Leafs were only able to nab third-line forward Colby Armstrong in early July, thanks to weak selection of available players. And this year's crop of free agents is arguably weaker. Plus their biggest needs - a centre like Brad Richards and, to a lesser extent, a goalie like Ilya Bryzgalov - are rumoured to be uninterested in coming to Toronto.  Cap concerns Every team has issues with their salary caps, and, quite honestly, when compared to those of the Chicago Blackhawks, Calgary Flames or New York Rangers, the Toronto Maple Leafs' problems look rather minuscule. However, like the Rangers who have former world-class defenceman Wade Redden and his $6.5 million contact buried in the minors, the Leafs have Jeff Finger playing in the AHL. While his salary doesn't go against the cap as a member of the Marlies, Finger's earnings compared to his quality of play in his first NHL season in Toronto meant the Leafs were forced to sign Mike Komisarek. Komisarek has underperformed mightily in his first two seasons with the Leafs and has three more seasons left on his hefty contract. The team will have to decide whether to continue to overpay him on the third pairing or go the Finger route - something general manager Brian Burke has been steadfastly against.  Misreading talent Aside from Jeff Finger and Mike Komisarek, the organization has a long history of either misreading talent or having players play their best hockey elsewhere. Just in their recent non-playoff years, the Leafs have undervalued the likes of Alex Steen and Tuukka Rask and overvalued - just in goal alone -Andrew Raycroft, Vesa Toskala and Justin Pogge. While Brian Burke is doing a much better job in this regard, namely with Nikolai Kulemin and Clarke MacArthur, there are still some blemishes.  Backing the wrong players On top of the Maple Leafs organization having made some irreversible decisions when it comes to judging talent, their present situation has also set them back. While the team's two core players, captain Dion Phaneuf and scoring winger Phil Kessel, can be considered good or even excellent NHLers, neither has proven to be a frontline player capable of leading a dominant team. Both have shown signs of brilliance this season, but Phaneuf still has defensive lapses and Kessel still generally avoids the tough areas on the ice. Considering they're paid to be superstars, that doesn't bode well for future success.  Out with the new and in with the old In the years leading up to the lockout, the Leafs were one of hockey's most consistent teams. From 1999 to 2004, the blue and white made the playoffs every year, reaching the Eastern Conference final twice, while only failing to advance past the first round once. They accomplished this by being one of the league's biggest spending teams and by mortgaging the future in deals for past stars in the twilight of their careers. The trades for Brian Leetch and Owen Nolan - where they gave up top prospect Brad Boyes - highlighted a team philosophy that would continue into the 2005-06 season when they signed Eric Lindros, Jason Allison and Jeff O'Neill. As one of the youngest teams in the NHL, the Leafs have certainly altered their course. But because it's only a recent change, it will take some time for those young players to reach their full potential.  Lack of truly elite players There's Dion Phaneuf and Phil Kessel today. There's Mats Sundin from a couple years ago. Doug Gilmour, Wendel Clark, Darryl Sittler, all of which are special talents to be sure. But there's hardly a Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Sidney Crosby or Alexander Ovechkin in the bunch. No the Leafs have not been known to dress truly elite-calibre players throughout the last half century. Aside from Gilmour, who won the Selke Trophy for his defensive prowess in 1993, no Leaf has won a major award in quite some time. In fact, only two have ever won the Hart Trophy - Babe Pratt (1944) and Ted Kennedy (1955).  Talented players playing with lesser-likes Maybe, just maybe, one of the past Maple Leafs' stars could have won a major award winner if he had had more talent to play with. It's a problem that has plagued the team for years. Other than the brief period when Mats Sundin got to line up beside Gary Roberts and Alexander Mogilny, the long-time captain was forced to have average players like Jonas Hoglund on his wing. (Hoglund miraculously managed to net 29 goals in 2000 thanks to Captain Mats). The same issue has hampered Phil Kessel in his early tenure in Toronto as the offensive drop off between Marc Savard, his former centre in Boston, and Tyler Bozak is drastic. With Brad Richards reportedly not interested in becoming a Maple Leaf, the age-old problem will likely continue."
570081,Rizzo,2011-04-08 00:53:00,4754,"pretty hard to argue with that! How many years will we see the leafs crap the bed early, play decent hockey when its too late and then miss the playoffs. Seriously, every year when they make this late run there are great hopes for the following year...just to see those hopes down the toilet before October ends!"

570101,timmeh,2011-04-08 01:23:00,609,"There's a really interesting book out there for sports nuts called scorecasting. The book discusses the hidden influences and biases that exist in sports. Lots of interesting stuff in there.  The last chapter describes the futility of the Chicago cubs over the past century. They attribute it largely to a lack of financial incentive to win. Most sports teams see their revenue (in the form of ticket sales, advertising, merchandise sale, etc.) change relative to the performance of the team, which makes a lot of sense. However a few teams have a relatively stable fanbase which seems to defy this. And the cubs have the most stable fanbase in MLB. No matter how well or poor the cubs did the year before, attendance and revenue held constant. So essentially a team in this position does not have the financial incentive to win that most teams do. And so they're quite content to just maintain the status quo. They provide a bunch of interesting stats and discussion that's too much to go into here but I couldn't help think of another team that seems to fit this profile."
570122,splashhopper,2011-04-08 01:50:00,2931,the leafs will start to improve as soon as the teachers Union sells them... and that should be soon because their pension fund is short a $$$$.....
570136,craigdritchie,2011-04-08 02:21:00,1586,The only thing about that article that I question is the five year timeframe.  Leafs have sucked since 1967.  What the heck is going to change in five years?
570150,Guest ThisPlaceSucks,2011-04-08 03:07:00,0,it's accurate historically but i think the article under appreciates how strong a game the buds had since the all star break.
570214,Governator,2011-04-08 13:21:00,879,"  There were 6 teams in 1967...  There have been many Leaf teams since that could've easily beat past Leaf championship teams, especially from the 90s.  They had good teams in much of the 90s, they didn't suck like they have the past 5 years."
570218,craigdritchie,2011-04-08 13:40:00,1586,"Could have .... should have ..... would have .... every year it's a different excuse.  Sorry man, but it's the truth. As long as the club is owned and operated by a bunch of bean counters, nothing's going to change.  Golf Leafs, Golf!"
570262,Lunatic,2011-04-08 17:50:00,536,"Most of what was said is true and nothing most long time fans didnt already know. A 1st line center is desperatly needed,we lost far too many face-offs and kessel needs a good play maker.  but the article says kessels numbers have dropped off without savard. last time i looked ,kessel has his best point production this year. on a side note ,another year of ron wilson is gonna suck. i cant stand looking at him. also ive never heard so many commentators and pannelists question a coaches decision(s) then when it comes to wilson. he isnt all the problems,but getting a different coach would be a step in the right direction. now if we can only turf the suits in the lower bowl"
570270,Mike Pike,2011-04-08 18:05:00,1332,"Remember though Lunatic, Ron inherited a team that's been torn down and rebuilt.  Almost the worst team in the league last year and this year knocking on the door of the playoffs.  I think we're going in the right direction and would give him my vote for next year."
570272,Lunatic,2011-04-08 18:16:00,536,also remember he has had 3 different teams infront of him and has posted 'team worst' in a few categories. i think maurice had a worse team then what ron did. how many times can you watch him take credit away from players? also him being voted on by 300+ players as coach you least would like to play for cant be too good for luring free agents no?
570337,spincast,2011-04-08 22:15:00,3279,"Hmm, I'm so used to them loosing I now use them for responses to telemarketers:  ""Hi This is Bell Canada calling, we notice you used to be a subscriber, and we were wondering:  what we could offer you to try us again"" ""Me: What, did the Leafs win the Cup?""

I'm not saying that a single owner that wanted to win above all would not make a difference, but for 1.3 billion who is going to do that. The facts are that the team makes boat loads of money whether they win or lose. If Leaf fans were more lake Hab fans (who almost boycott the team when they suck) than there would be more incentive to win. Basically all die hard Leaf fans only have themselves to blame for the pathetic results of their team. That is a tough pill to swallow."
570609,Chance,2011-04-10 00:06:00,420,"  Speaking of sheep ,how about the people who use the same argument over and over again yet it makes absolutely no sense at all.Soooo the leafs brass do not care about winning just the money?We all know playoff revenue is next to nothing right...well isn't it? If they DID win the cup can you imagine how that would bring in the money? If making money was the goal would not a few rounds of playoff hockey be an incentive??? So without support the leafs are going to magically come up with better players??Yes sir boycott the Leafs and Brad Richards will say""hey now theres a place I want to play"".You just might have Crosby thinking about asking for a trade."
570658,Oggie,2011-04-10 02:06:00,588,"Lunatic is right if you listened to Don Cherry tonight.   ""Reimer saved Wilson's ass with his play since the all-star break"" (Don Cherry). He tore a strip off of Wilson for not abandoning Giguere before Christmas and for not keeping Kadri from the get-go.  Kadri outscore all kinds of other outstanding rookies on other teams during the exhibition season, yet Wilson sent him back to the AHL.  I agree with Cherry (not usually) when he says the penalty kill unit hasn't been coached and that's why they place 29th in PK each year. It's not a skill like the PP, it's a coached unit. Wilson doesn't know how to coach specialty units. It would help if they had a centre that could win a draw on either specialty team.  Dan O."
570714,Chance,2011-04-10 13:09:00,420,Agreed but it isnt ususally the job of the head coach to work the PP or the PK.That job has always fallen on the shoulders of the assistants. 
570786,Lunatic,2011-04-10 18:23:00,536,"and the assistants are usually put there by the coach. again wilson.  i dont like bruce boudreau,but i give him credit for his coaching. he took a high powered scoring team whichh style wasnt good enough to win the cup,and with basicly the same team turned it into a a more defencive team,since goal tending wasnt the teams strong point.and its working. wilson on the other hand with the pp and pk and when goaltending was sub-par did nothing! ""keep working on it,keep working on it"" oh and maybe chage the line up 6 times a game,or during the season try 2 maybe 3 different PP quarterbacks. what a joke, how about change the box style PP, try a few different systems maybe one will gel right for this team. dosent talk behind the bench either. just stands there confused looks to the referees."
570794,Chance,2011-04-10 18:56:00,420,"Coaches request a bench staff GM's assign a bench staff.How do you think woody has lasted as long as he has in Toronto.  Dont get me wrong I am no fan of wilsons but when you have all hammers and no screwdeivers then its tough to get the job done.They have made subtle adjustments all year long,they just were not good enough.The PP went to a pressure down low attack with one high and that did not produce as well as it should have.The Pk has gone from the traditional 2-2 to a 1-2-1 to a 1-1-2 and back again....no luck at all.I know if I were a coach and saw Brent and Boyce as my top PK unit I would run for the hills.  Sure wilson is a poor excuse for a coach but not having much to work with does have its effect."
570797,Oggie,2011-04-10 19:05:00,588,Agreed Chance. Why did they stay so long with Giguere and why would they even consider a resign?  He wasn'ta great goalie when he won the cup with Anaheim. I always thought they won despite their goaltending.  Dan O.
570810,Rainbow Darter,2011-04-10 20:08:00,8,"If you ask me, the leafs will get better once Burke gets rid of his dead beat buddy Ron Wilson, and gets a coach that knows more about the newer style of the game, and has a better read on developing young players...  Burke is at fault for alot of the Leafs shortcomings too. He just plays it be the numbers and depth chart, refuses to admit he's wrong. If he noticed in the Pre-season that Riemer was better than Gustov! Then the leafs would've been a play off team, not to mention keeping Mike Zigomanis up since he's one of the better penalty killers and faceoff man in the game. But again it's a numbers game with Burke and Wilson, they rely too much on their projected depth charts not actually on who's playing good enough to be on the team.  Another major misread of Burke and Wilson was sending Kadri down in his first year! I don't care how bad you are defensively but when you lead the team in scoring in the pre-season you BLOODY PLAY THE KID! Lol... HOw would you have felt if the coach told you ""yah you scored four goals and such but you still need more developing, we're gonna keep up Deadbeat Rick WALLIN instead of you!"" Skinner on Carolina scored one goal in the preseason and he still made the time... Kadri missed out on 2 years of good proffessional development with the Big CLub Courtesy of Burke and Wilson's poor hockey insight and poor read of the game today!  I rest my Case,,, Do yourselves a favor and just follow a more well run franchise liek Detriot or Vancouver, and do without the stresses of analyzing a team that seems will never be fixed lol.."
570813,Gregoire,2011-04-10 20:15:00,1397," As it stands now Richards has flat out said that said that he will not sign with the leafs. I doubt whether Crosby would want to play for Toronto as well. While most teams need to make the playoffs consistently in order to make money, the leafs are not in that situation. I think that sheep comment was a bit too close to home for you. The fact is that the maple leafs as an organization have less incentive to win because they can count on leaf nation turning out in droves to support the team win, lose or draw. If you want to blame anyone for the mismanagement of the leafs it is the fans. Having said that the leafs finally look like they are on the rebound. It's just a shame that it took so long."
570828,Oggie,2011-04-10 21:08:00,588,"Geez if Burke and Wilson decide to send Kadri down for lack of defensive play, how the hell does Kessel get away with being -23 or what ever he is. Yeah he scored 32 but he was on for 55 against assuming he's not on the penalty kill.   Kadri needed seasoning but not a whole season in the minors.  Dan O."
