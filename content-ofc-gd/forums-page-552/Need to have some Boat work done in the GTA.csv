571866,BucktownAngler,2011-04-13 16:03:00,582,Im posting for a friend of mine. He needs to have a bow mount trolling motor and fish finder installed on his boat. BPS quoted him $300...I thought this was high. Can anybody recommend someone who could do this in the GTA for a reasonable price?  Thanks
571880,Roy,2011-04-13 17:31:00,13728,I think a lot of the guys in this community would fix you up for a beer or two.
571890,irishfield,2011-04-13 17:59:00,26272,"Hell, I don't remember even getting a beer out of this guy... I gotta look into that!    As for $300 to install a trolling motor AND a fish finder... I can see that amount pretty quick if they are supplying the circuit breaker for the TMotor and possibly a socket/plug.  What kind of boat.. ie how hard is access to where stuff needs to go.. where wires need to run, etc?"
571892,BucktownAngler,2011-04-13 18:04:00,582," 14' Misty River....pretty easy to run wires on it. Other then the casting deck, mostly everything is exposed."
571893,irishfield,2011-04-13 18:08:00,26272,And did that quote include items like the $50 circuit breaker and a power socket to plug into? Still stuff he needs even if someone jumps up to help wire things up for him. I'm 2 hours North and a tad strapped for time.
571929,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-13 20:32:00,10439, Not to mention wire ain't free.
571936,jedimaster,2011-04-13 20:58:00,3472,"Mounting the battery as well, likely they would use a battery tray, socket/receptical, breaker, possibly a connection for a charger etc...Add in the materials and its likely only about 100 bucks labour. So its not that unreasonable of a price. Mind you I would do it myself if it was my boat."
571969,cwpowell,2011-04-13 22:50:00,265,"I'm in Hamilton, wouldn't mind doing it for a couple bucks on top of parts."
571990,Terry,2011-04-13 23:40:00,14456, was that included it the cost of the unit.....   I did appreciate the help...

572052,mike rousseau,2011-04-14 02:28:00,4661,I re wiried my Lund and im no electrician... I googled all the wiring diagrams and the end result was nice...
572119,devy,2011-04-14 13:10:00,13,"  I may be Canadas Worst Handyman, but yesterday was able to install MinnKota Terrova trolling motor bracket and motor, move batteries from back to front compartment, upgrade to 24 volt system with battery trays, minnkota circuit braker, as well as 2 bank charger.  Ran wiring through conduit by attaching old 12 volt wiring and pulling through. Ended up working out well!!  Last year installed my Lowrance HDS system myself. Was a little more tricky attaching power lines to fuse ( under driver console, but had problems at all.  You can do it!!"

572173,Fish4Eyes,2011-04-14 16:33:00,1022,300$ sounds fair to me.
