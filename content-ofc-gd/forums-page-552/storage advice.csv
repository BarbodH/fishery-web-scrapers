My sister and her husband just pruchased a home outside of london  with this place comes a 50 x 80  driving shead completely wired  all closed in and at least 16` high ceiling and a concret floor. The house  also has 30 by 30 concret pad that is out side.  Now becides the obivious thing being i no longer have to store my boat out side  under a tarp  for the winter. I was woundering what options they have for renting out storage  anyone know of the good the bad the ugly ? what they should look into ? Price? Would there be much interest in the london area?  Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated  Thank-You

Having said that, by-laws are usually only enforced on a complaint basis.  If they get along with their neighbors they probably won't have to worry about the by-laws.  Another concern is insurance.  Can they get insurance to cover loss or damage of their cutomers boats?  What impact will renting out space have on their house insurance?"
