Fishing has been pretty much on the back burner with family and work taking up most of my time.  Its really cool to watch Jack experience the change in seasons. He totally grasps the concept of winter/spring/summer and fall. This morning he asked...OOOOH...daddy...wheres the snow? ice is melting.....byeboat coming....summer?  That inspired me to fix together a photo/video of him in the last 2 weeks as he enjoyed being outside without freezing his poor little...erm..well freezing...lol.   I know the song is titled ""Cloudy"", but i have always found it very uplifting and hopeful....it kinda strangely fits with the theme of spring.....hope you like it.    FOR MUM...we love you  <iframe title=""YouTube video player"" width=""480"" height=""390"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/Nj3CyZGlgGM"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>"
