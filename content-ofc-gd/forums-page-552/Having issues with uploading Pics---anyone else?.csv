572096,bushart,2011-04-14 11:30:00,2628,I've tried replying to a thread with a pic last 24 hrs--says server error message on reply board  I checked my status--my file is empty in uploads  Is it me?
572100,Spiel,2011-04-14 11:39:00,9065,Seems okay here....     
572101,HTHM,2011-04-14 12:03:00,4082,Kinda ironic don't ya think??? You have a red X for a pic.
572105,dave524,2011-04-14 12:19:00,4508,"I think photobuckeet is doing some work on their site, many avatars have a message to that effect on several boards the last couple of days.  edit: is this what you are talking bout? I noticed though the problem with overlapping posts in threads with pictures has returned recently."
572107,Michael_Brown,2011-04-14 12:25:00,411,"I have not been able to post any pictures either. It says the server returned an error. Does not matter the source of the photo, web or personal it is denied.  Maybe they just were not interesting enough..."

572112,bushart,2011-04-14 12:39:00,2628,That server msg is what I got--I'll try again----nope server returned an error during upload is what it says  Thanks
