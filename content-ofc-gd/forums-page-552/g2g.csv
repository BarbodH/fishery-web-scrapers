We then ask him to hold the camp as best he can and give us preferred booking. Talk to the people who have over the years donated time, money and effort to again step up to the plate to put prizes on the table even though few winners have taken the time to drop a note to the sponsors to thank them. I won't even go into what it takes for myself as a sponsor and the person the farthest away to drive 14 hours to get there. Well the good news is I have done it for the past 6 years because the people who show up are darn glad to see me and they are the cream of the crop in my book. I am sorry that some can not attend and no matter what date it is some still can not attend. Sorry for the rant but when we have expended as much effort as we have to get this organized every year it seems like a slap in the face and if it were not for the good friends that show up I could be 1000.oo dollars richer a year and many hours ahead of the game by passing on this wonderful event.

565792,mercman,2011-03-25 12:51:00,7054,"I, as a new relatively member, think you guys are doing a bang up job !!!Don't let the silly rantings of one silly person deter you from the enjoyment you guys obviously have in holding these G2G's I for one will be driving 8 hours to be there this year. That means i truly believe that i will be enjoying myself, and that i belive in all of the work you guys have done to ensure my enjoyment.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK ALL OF YOU !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
565807,GBW,2011-03-25 13:29:00,8460,Sorry folks but my wife and kids care more for fathers day then I do so it's not going to happen for me.  I'll try and have you 3 over to my folks place on the lake one weekend.
565808,lew,2011-03-25 13:32:00,12766,"I didn't attend last years g2g at Lakair but I was there for the 6 previous years and it's always a great time.  Like Art says though, it would be absolutely impossible to pick a date that would suit everybody and no matter when it was,  there would be guys complaining that they can't make that time frame for one reason or another.  There's still nearly 3 months before the g2g so that should give everybody that's interested a chance to set it up."
565824,irishfield,2011-03-25 14:25:00,26272,"Get the kids to call you on Fathers Day, while you are enjoying your special day out on the water at Lakair.  It'll give you an advanced feeling of what it will be like when you finally get them out of your house!!!"
565870,John,2011-03-25 15:45:00,2956,I tried calling Barbara on our wedding anniversary for the first few years...........didn't always get the warm and fuzzy response I was hoping for. Now I bring her with me and we celebrate there...........
571588,Jer,2011-04-12 22:46:00,1426,"Well Sandra & I are booked for a campsite and dockage for the get2gether. We'll be Lakair virgins, so please be gentle...  Just need to decide if we should bring the dog."
571593,lew,2011-04-12 22:54:00,12766, Plenty of guys bring their dogs Jer and they have as much fun as everyone.
571597,Jer,2011-04-12 23:01:00,1426,  She's still young and only had limited boat time last year. I'll have to see how she is early this season.  Sandra's worried that I'll be out fishing all day and she'll be stuck dog-sitting back at camp.
571631,Rich Clemens,2011-04-13 00:05:00,3131,"We'll be letting our two behind this year.   We're bringing our son-in-law this time, and just a wee bit too crowded for the long trip.  We'll miss them though."
571637,aplumma,2011-04-13 00:15:00,6896,Ummm Rich can we vote on this? lets take a poll  Everyone who wants the dogs type 1.  Everyone who wants Rich type 2.  Just kidding we are going to miss them though.  Art
571644,cynmar,2011-04-13 00:25:00,169,"Okay, as a newbie can someone give me the details. Do I call Lakair and book a cottage myself , is there a group rate? Is there a special group of cottages? Can someone give me an idea of the cost? Do I have to reserve a boat or do we go out with each other? (I know that doesn;t sound right). Feel free to PM me.  Bill"
571687,ChrisK,2011-04-13 01:27:00,2772,"Bill, There are camping sites as well as cottages. I would call Kevin ahead of time and book a site or a cottage and a boat for your stay. http://www.lakair.com/"
565595,corvette1,2011-03-24 20:20:00,1765,are the dates set for lakair
565603,BUSTER,2011-03-24 20:36:00,1336,"Of course it is, we aren't asked for a vote , they tell us when it is."
565606,ChrisK,2011-03-24 20:39:00,2772,Just bumped the Lakair thread for ya corvette1
565613,aplumma,2011-03-24 20:59:00,6896, A vote??? yea lets try that sometime and see if we get 365 different answers.   Art
565641,BUSTER,2011-03-24 22:58:00,1336,"  So fathers day is better? General canvass and throwing say 2-4 dates to narrow it down would have been nice, look at the amount of members that are not able to attend. It works for other gatherings in the fall and winter, but what do I know."
565642,danbouck,2011-03-24 23:11:00,4380,"It doesn't matter what date it is, a bunch of people won't be able to attend no matter what"
565643,mercman,2011-03-24 23:45:00,7054,Someone said the 17-19 of June Has that been changed or were they just speculating.
565644,irishfield,2011-03-24 23:47:00,26272,Them's the dates Paul ! Sounds like it might be going back to an invite only affair again soon....
565646,mercman,2011-03-24 23:55:00,7054,"Well, i hope i find out soon enough. I was planning on going this year.Hate to drive 8hours for nuttin"
565668,Roy,2011-03-25 01:13:00,13728,"Buster....you've been here how long? Have you been to one just ONE yet? It has always been on the same weekend except for one year. There are also other considerations...for example, try to get a lodge to hold things open till the eleventh hour because someone forgot to ask their better half if that date was ok. This is the way it works. If you guys want to look after it and find a date where everyone can be present, great go for it. It won't work Bubba. We've been in this business for too long. If someone else wants to handle it, I have no problem with that."
565676,skeeter,2011-03-25 01:36:00,1907,"As Roy said. My anniversary is that weekend,so i know it has been that weekend for a long time. Normally a guy wouldn't be allowed to go away fishing on his anniversary, so i was smart about it. I bring my wife with me Killing 2 birds with one stone LOL.  Mercman, you doubted me as to when it is? Ha, like i would be wrong.  "
565680,Nipfisher,2011-03-25 01:49:00,2449,"I understand the tradition the ""regulars"" have with this weekend. It is always booked for that weekend well in advance so the ""yankee"" crew and other from far away can plan ahead and make it. I also agree with Buster that Father's day is difficult for some to get away. I will be 40 minutes away, like last year, and I may still not make it (like last year). Father's day means more to my wife and kids then it does to me. Either way I'll plan to make a showing. If I do great..if I don't I'll still fish, enjoy a fire with friends and drink beer. Hope to see you all there, meet some members and chat with Kevin about the West Arm."
565686,BUSTER,2011-03-25 01:59:00,1336,"Met you at the picton merlin park one year roy. My work is summer related 8ths on 4 mths off. but would have liked to come with my wife and kids , just haven't been able to Yet."
565688,ChrisK,2011-03-25 02:05:00,2772,Your kidding me right ?
565695,irishfield,2011-03-25 02:22:00,26272,I think Roy got that one Chris.. give it some more thought!  Heck.. even Mercman knew what I was getting at...
565699,mercman,2011-03-25 02:33:00,7054,  Hey !! I think i resemble that remark
565701,ChrisK,2011-03-25 02:38:00,2772,Sorry Wayne but we have put a lot of thought into these G2G dates and worked with Kevin as best we could so you'll have to forgive me if I'm not getting your joke.
565703,irishfield,2011-03-25 02:41:00,26272,What's the trophy called Chris?
565704,Pikeslayer,2011-03-25 02:41:00,1443, Hope not  Slayer
565706,kickingfrog,2011-03-25 02:45:00,8333,I never was part of the in crowd in high school.
565709,HTHM,2011-03-25 02:48:00,4082,"Heck, I never went to high school"
565712,skeeter,2011-03-25 02:53:00,1907,"Pikeslayer, does this mean you are coming this year??? Great im looking forward to you,mercman and GBW being there this year"
565716,mercman,2011-03-25 02:59:00,7054,  And i was the first in my familly to gradiate before the age of 30
