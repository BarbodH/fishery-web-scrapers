I was happy to find a Canadian store that ships from Canada. Every other store it seems they either don't ship to Canada or leave you wondering about importing fees. (BPS, Amazon etc.)"
570823,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-10 20:50:00,10439,I have dealt with them quitea bit and have had nothing but positive experiences. They have even ordered stuff for me that isn't listed on the site. (mounting brackets and power cables for a finder).
