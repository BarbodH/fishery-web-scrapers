571077,fishnsled,2011-04-11 14:53:00,3520,Hey! I made the video!  Fun playing around with that stuff and a great way to recap a bunch of pictures.
571092,grt1,2011-04-11 15:22:00,638,"great job, I wish I knew how to do that. I tried a few times and never really got anything that worked. best I could do was put some pics on a cd."
571099,trapshooter,2011-04-11 15:44:00,1234,"Good stuff Joey.  Looks like a good year for you and Paul.  Awesome boat, and love seeing the muskie too."
571152,Pikeslayer,2011-04-11 18:44:00,1443,"Great vid . I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind taking a shot at it. What software did you use (is it free?) and how long did it take you to put together? Thx for sharing,  Regards, Slayer"
571157,Joey,2011-04-11 18:52:00,9122,"Thanks all, it was fun to make (a little frustrating at times).  Slayer, I just used the one off Youtube, it pretty much guides you through it and is free  The hardest part is getting the pictures to end when the song ends"
