571925,DRIFTER_016,2011-04-13 20:30:00,10439,The NWT is a small place and I have met most of the candidates personally and I know who I'm voting for and no matter what the party leaders say they will never sway my vote because for the most part they can't be believed. My choice is based on local performance and the fact he has nothing to do with the red or blue parties!! If you want my vote don't align yourself with those lying buggers.  Nuff said!!    :tease:

571807,12footspringbok,2011-04-13 12:44:00,459,I'm just curious if anyone else's lower body sphinctor tightened like mine did when Iggy started ranting about gun control?  
571814,lookinforwalleye,2011-04-13 13:05:00,4399,"  I think the Liberals are pretty much done after Count Iggies performance, party loyalties aside I can`t believe how anybody could vote for this guy. Missing 70% of the votes in the house is shameful. Part time Canadian looking for a new part time gig, well Mr.Ignatief the office of the Prime Minister of Canada is not a part time gig so back to Boston with ya!"
571817,lew,2011-04-13 13:18:00,12766,"I've voted in every municipal, provincial & federal election for more than 40 years but the last time I voted, was definetely the LAST time I'll ever vote again.  It's just getting too tough to pick the best of the worst anymore and I've got far more important things to occupy my mind."
571830,Headhunter,2011-04-13 13:44:00,5703,"I watched the whole thing last night, kinda waiting for the train wreck to take place. Human nature forces one to watch disasters as they unfold... Best line of the night, I thought anyway, was from Layton. Now I am not a fan of the guy, but I do appreciate a good line. Layton to Harper... as best my memory serves... Mr. Harper, we don't need anymore penitentiaries, the folks in the Senate are quite happy where they are! HH"

571854,POLLIWOGG,2011-04-13 15:00:00,835,"They came off much better than last time with Elizabeth May there talking facts and figures looking like she was the only  person in the room that knew what was going on.  My local rep. is a member of the ""tough on crime as long as we're not the ones doing the crime"" party and says he's not interested in federal issues, probably because he's not allowed to talk about them, and wants to concentrate on local issues, so I'll give him a vote when he runs for council."
