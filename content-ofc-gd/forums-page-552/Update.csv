But when the treatment for that didn't work, they set out looking for other answers. Given my history with cancer, that was where they started. They found a tumor on my adrenal gland and kidney. I then got severe gout on and off. The treatment and prognosis are excellent! It became necessary for me to sell off my web design business. Because of that I have a contract that says I cannot have contact with former clients for 90 days (the new owner owns all contracts now) nor can I engage in any new web design projects for six months. I have also taken a temporary leave of my admin duties here. I can't do much until the gout goes away anyway. Hope to be back to everything normal in a month or two!"
