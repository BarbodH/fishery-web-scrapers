663195,hirk,2012-02-03 13:14:00,571,These are older rods just wondering if anyone has fished them and their opinon of them.I found a new one and am debating if rods have improved for the money since then or if this is a classic and better than most now at that level.
663198,solopaddler,2012-02-03 13:30:00,8605,"I have an 81/2' 3pc 6wt that I've had for over 20 years. I love it, use it all the time.  It's got a very smooth moderate action and is light and crisp. IMO it compares favourably to any of the newer high end blanks.  If I could find another one I'd probably buy it so I say go for it!"
663221,hirk,2012-02-03 15:06:00,571,"I've never used a fly rod, this is a 8'6"" #7 thinking for smallies and lm. Any advantage to going 9'?"
663227,BillM,2012-02-03 15:22:00,17367, You'll want something longer for punching out those big bass baits..   A 8'6 7wt is going to be quite meaty.
663249,solopaddler,2012-02-03 16:24:00,8605," Well actually not to be contrary, but most guys punching out big brushy bugs use rods shorter than 9 feet."
663250,cuzza,2012-02-03 16:25:00,467," That'll be fine (as Bill says a bit longer would make life easier but 8'6 will work for you) - put an 8wt line on it too, I use a Rio Mainstream Bass lines for both my bass setups, nice short front taper for turning over big non-aerodynamic flies."
663256,BillM,2012-02-03 17:02:00,17367," From a boat you definitely want something longer then shorter.  I can't imagine trying to punch out big flies with my 7'6 5wt with any sort of distance, lol.  It's fine for the smaller resident trout streams however."
663350,esoxansteel,2012-02-03 22:13:00,1307,"I have a custom 12ft 6in Fenwick World class float rod, and im sure their flyrods are just as nice  GO FOR IT  hirk"
663453,Dabluz,2012-02-04 09:12:00,701,Definitely go for the 9 weight rod if you want to fish bass with large bugs.
663496,Snidley,2012-02-04 16:02:00,620,"Try FFO-Tackle.com. They have an 8'6"" 7 weight and a 9'6"" 6wt. $75 for brand new rods (last week they were 20% off. This week it's free US shipping. The deal changes frequently). I would wonder if they were original World Class rods however. World Class rods were literally from the 1980's. I had a 9' 6wt Fenwick HMG that was a nice bass flyrod. In Fenwick  I think the Iron Feather was probably their best product for flyrods. I saw one for sale the other day on ebay."
663498,woodenboater,2012-02-04 16:46:00,2277,I think an 8 or 9 weight forward would be fine. Have used 6WF for wooly buggers but not the most fun time but then I was never an all star caster
663558,hirk,2012-02-04 20:45:00,571,"I think the world class was more $ than the iron feather ( had one in a mh casting rod, broke 3 on sets!!!). I was thinking 9' 8wt. but this rod came up so Im considering it. Yes it's an original and still in the box it came with."
663587,superdad,2012-02-04 23:06:00,353,"I've had a Fenwick graphite 9010 for over 25 years, still in great shape and had many Fenwick fiberglass before - always a good rod.  Just my .02  David  aka  Superdad"
909549,Smokercrafty,2015-04-12 10:26:00,227,"I have a 14' world class, not using it now, but loved it on the rivers! Great rod for its purpose."

Sorry Bill, but I'm siding with Mike on this one, you'll have an easier time building line speed and punching out larger flies with a shorter rod then a longer. A long rod will give you more distance IF you're using a long line as well, but with a bass line or shooting head it will be a nice combo. There's a reason most bass specific rods are 7'11""-8'6""."

I think that because 7'11 is legal tournament length, so companies build lines for these style of rods with the shorter tapers"
