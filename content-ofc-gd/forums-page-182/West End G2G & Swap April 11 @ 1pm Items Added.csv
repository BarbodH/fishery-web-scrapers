905419,grizzlybri,2015-03-22 20:32:00,565,"Hello fellow OFC members  Iâ€™m coming to you with an idea that Pikeslayer and myself came up with. With the nicer weather finally here we want to organize a GTA west end get together. We want to do something simple like wings and drinks, followed by a swap meet or swap meet followed by wings and drinks.  We are planning on doing it on Saturday April 11 . We picked this date because both Simon and I are sure most of us are going to be hitting the creek and river beds later in April.  We want to have it close to one of the major highways that is why I picked the following location  The Live Bait Ale House http://www.livebaitalehouse.com/  1185 Maple Ave, Milton, ON L9T 0A5 It is located just minutes away from James Snow Parkway and the 401  Swap: 1:00pm  Food: 2:30pm  Cheers  (updated April 08)"
905422,lew,2015-03-22 20:46:00,12766,We used to get together quite a bit years ago but it just seemed to fade away. Hope you get it off the ground and have a great time.
905430,Loonietoon,2015-03-22 21:48:00,1450,Use to get together at the Fire Hall in Bronte
905433,Christopheraaron,2015-03-22 21:56:00,3525,I'm in as long as I don't have to work that day.
905437,Shloim,2015-03-22 22:03:00,515,I'd be interested for sure!
905439,Acountdeleted,2015-03-22 22:08:00,2562,I'd like to make it.
905440,mattaw,2015-03-22 22:13:00,162,I would also try to make it if I can!
905461,bigugli,2015-03-22 23:24:00,6138,Sounds interesting. I guess it depends on how far west you are coming out.
905462,HTHM,2015-03-22 23:29:00,4082,"I would suggest that you not pick a location by committee, but simply pick one. Dictate the time, the place and format, and everyone who is interested will fall into line. I'm at the head of that line BTW. Great idea!"
905463,Handlebarz,2015-03-22 23:31:00,3790,Would love to get out but will be busy getting things ready for the odyssey two weeks later.
905470,grizzlybri,2015-03-22 23:39:00,565,"I would suggest that you not pick a location by committee, but simply pick one. Dictate the time, the place and format, and everyone who is interested will fall into line. I'm at the head of that line BTW. Great idea!  I like that ok I'm going to pick a spot.  EDITED: Original post edited as well, I selected The Live Bait Ale House located at 1185 Maple Ave, Milton, ON L9T 0A5. This is just minutes from James Snow Parkway and the 401.  Here is a link to their website http://www.livebaitalehouse.com/, I've been before, and the food and service was great not to mention the 90+ types of beer they have"
905477,tender52,2015-03-23 00:01:00,270,I should be able to attend.
905479,Pikeslayer,2015-03-23 00:13:00,1443,"DB, Is there sufficient parking area for a tailgate tackle swap?? I got a lot of gear @ garage sale pricing I'd like to see repurposed."
905486,grizzlybri,2015-03-23 00:28:00,565,"Sage advice Albert and see that DB has followed. DB, Is there sufficient parking area for a tailgate tackle swap?? I got a lot of gear @ garage sale pricing I'd like to see repurposed.  Yes there is Plenty of parking "
905517,HTHM,2015-03-23 04:38:00,4082, Yes there is Plenty of parking  Google earth is a wonderful thing. The wry pronouncement of Plenty of Parking made me laugh.
905614,tender52,2015-03-23 21:48:00,270,What time?  1pm?
905641,grizzlybri,2015-03-23 22:47:00,565,What time?  1pm?  Sure I was thinking that anyways
905700,tender52,2015-03-24 02:09:00,270,I was just throwing it out there.  I did not want to step on your toe's Brian.
905701,grizzlybri,2015-03-24 02:17:00,565,"I was just throwing it out there.  I did not want to step on your toe's Brian.  Well great minds think alike then Colin,  and don't worry you weren't stepping on my toes, since this is my first time spear heading such a event.  Thanks for the input and looking forward to seeing you again"
