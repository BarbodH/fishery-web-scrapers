Just curious to hear everybody's opinions on what the best way to go about this would be."
909111,ecmilley,2015-04-09 19:36:00,2163,i use CLR or a sos pad but honestly never gave much consideration to what it would do to wood
909114,bare foot wader,2015-04-09 19:43:00,1354,"don't think they advise clr for contact with wood, but you could rinse it out thoroughly and dry it  how bad is the rust? I would start with some oil and scrub it out"
909124,aplumma,2015-04-09 20:30:00,6896,Chris post a picture of the knife I have a few things that work and if it is to bad you can ship it to me and I will restore it.   Art

909238,Paudash,2015-04-10 13:35:00,273,put it a baking dish then cover it with a can of coke and let it sit over night.  You would be amazed at what the acid in that stuff does to rusted metal
