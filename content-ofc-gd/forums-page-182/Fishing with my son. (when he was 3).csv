Was watching this one this evening and my heart nearly exploded out of my chest...I LOVE HIM SO MUCH! He is just an awesomely kind, polite, considerate and compasionate little dood who is smart as hell! VERY PROUD OF HIM.  Had to share this one again from 2012....the conversations we had in the boat were great...cant wait to get out in the boat again.   "
