Probably great numbers of average size Walleye and Northern, with an occasional trophy?   Since it is a remote lake it is difficult finding anyone that has fished it.  Has anyone been to Lobo Lake?  Or any experiences at Hawk Air's other lakes?  "

909485,Indy Buckeye,2015-04-12 00:26:00,3,"Wow, this is great.   I really didn't expect a lake this small and remote to have a depth map.  This will be a huge help.  Thank you!"

My boys were only 9 and 12 at the time so we did quite a bit of trolling with bottom bouncers. Walleyes were about 15 to 20 ft deep and plentiful in the 16-20"" range. Portable depth finder helped a bunch. We caught a few pike but really not that many. We didn't make it to the portage lake but hope to this year. Cabin was very clean. Hot shower and the generator were nice touches."
