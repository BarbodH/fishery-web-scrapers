909868,irishfield,2015-04-13 17:48:00,26272,"Charger.. what's a charger for a starting battery.. oh the motor! My boat batteries never come out... they get the charger slapped on them when I bring the boat out for the last time after Musky (and usually get a green light that they're fully charged). I hit them one more time in say February and then again before she hits the water any day now. All leaving a trickle charger on a battery day in day out does is sulphate it or boil it dry.  On board charger is for the electric trolling motor.. nothing else and if you're running older batteries you'd better keep a good eye on yours, as once they don't like coming up to full charge the on board won't shut off (green light) it will keep charging and boil them dry."
909874,ecmilley,2015-04-13 18:36:00,2163,I dont take batterys out at all anymore charge em before storage undo cables for draw. checked all 3 after sitting all winter and lowest was 12.2 vts not any different than when in house all winter
909914,Mister G,2015-04-13 21:49:00,1429," If the on-board charger is a smart charger it should not boil them dry and if it does you might have defective on-board charging system. I have had mine for many years now and I have stated it extended my starting battery for 9 years plus maintained my batteries (3) ALL the time I'm not fishing and even during winter storage. I also don't remove them in the winter, too heavy to lift. I really believe this extends years onto your batteries and pays for itself in the long run.  I have this model but there are many other manufactures that have similar on-board chargers that should also maintain all your batteries making life much simpler after a long day on the water.  http://promariner.com/products/waterproof-on-board-marine-battery-chargers/prosport-series/"
909967,captpierre,2015-04-14 01:37:00,2521,Just came from Costco Took a picture of their marine battery but don't know how to post a photo Said Starting/Deep Cycle Marine RV 27DC Figment code 14 845 Marine Cranking Amps 120 amp hours Forgot to note price Anybody know if this would work for a 115 Yammy 4str?
909968,BillM,2015-04-14 01:39:00,17367,Group 27 is a fine starting battery.
909970,captpierre,2015-04-14 01:41:00,2521,Just checked in manual. Min 502 marine cranking amps Min 124 amp hours Will it work well ?
909971,Consigliere,2015-04-14 01:43:00,121,
909979,Fisherpete,2015-04-14 02:25:00,1814,"Thanks for all the responses everyone.  My motor is a 30hp Honda, does not take much juice to start it. I took the boat out yesterday catfishing, and the motor started up fine all day and the fishfinder showed the voltage at the lowest was 11.9V.  My Honda does all the charging, I've popped my onboard charger on it from time to time and always had green light (full charge). It took a charge this spring after sitting all winter.  I'm going to replace it just to be safe, think I will take everyone's advice and go for the Costco battery. I have zero complaints about the Nautilus AGM - like I said, it's been flawless... But hey if the Costco will accomplish the same thing for less money why not.  Cheers Pete"
910010,Sinker,2015-04-14 10:54:00,8692,Cant you pull start that engine anyways? Mine is a manual start 40hp....
910024,ecmilley,2015-04-14 12:24:00,2163,30hp easily get away with a true deep cycle 27 there usually only around the 220cca but run all day for electronics and such and had no issues starting a carbed v6 150 2 stroke. Wouldnt reccomend it for dfi systems. but if your mostly trolling then it doesnt really matter if the honda is charging most of the time a dualpurpose will more than be adequate
910065,Fisherpete,2015-04-14 14:56:00,1814,It can be pull started - but you have to remove the cowling and wind the rope on manually. It's not built in.
909519,Fisherpete,2015-04-12 02:22:00,1814,"So I got the boat all ready for action today, and hooked up my fishfinder which has a voltage meter. The voltage on my starting battery was 12.1V, and within 10 minutes of having the fishfinder on was down to 11.7V. I've had it for 7 years, Motomaster Nautilus AGM, it's been flawless but I'm guessing it's probably done. It did something like this one day at the very beginning of last season, fishfinder kept cutting out and the voltage was low. I gave it a charge when I got home that day and it was fine for the rest of the season. I charged it a couple days ago just to make sure it was topped up fully.  Thoughts?  If she's dead, any suggestions for a new battery? I'm leaning towards getting the exact same AGM, which I think is $319 or so. Are they that much better than the normal marine starting batteries? Almost triple the cost..."
909522,Paudash,2015-04-12 02:36:00,273,"No need to spend that kind of money on a starting battery.  I have a Kirkland from Costco, I think they go for around $120 and has worked great for years"
909547,Garnet,2015-04-12 10:15:00,2056,"Load test is the only way to find out. CTC, local garage, you can buy 1 for $50."
909550,davey buoy,2015-04-12 10:29:00,5505,After a complete charge Pete it should hold at least 12.7-12.9 volts 24 hours later.Sounding like yours is not so good now.
909553,wormdunker,2015-04-12 10:51:00,1711,Charge your battery on a 2 amp (trickle) charge for 2 or 3 days.  See if the reading will come up higher than 12.1 volts.  $319.00 for a starting battery sounds expensive.  I use 2 Nautilus deep cycle batteries from CTC. $165.00 each.  In the off season I put them on a trickle charge every 4 or 5 weeks.  Batterystuff.com has excellent advice on batteries & chargers.
909557,lew,2015-04-12 11:27:00,12766,"As Paudash said, go to Costco and pick up a Kirkland battery for around $100 and  your all set and don't need to worry about being stranded somewhere on the water.  Nothing worse that worrying if things will work or not."
909563,Smokercrafty,2015-04-12 12:35:00,227,"If you never charged it over the winter season, then charge it at a very low amperage for a day or two, then try again. Other than that, I'd assume it's toast."
909618,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-12 15:51:00,8243,"There are many threads about batteries here. It comes up every spring. What I did learn from researching batteries a few years back is 80% of all batteries are made by Johnson Controls and most of them are made in China. Kirkland is the city Costco headquarters are in, thus the Kirkland name, they are Johnsons. The biggest difference in battery prices are the number of discharges below 20% a battery can have and still hold a charge. Also check the manufacturers date on a new battery, they bring the older stock to the front of the shelves, it's not good for a battery to sit for a long period of time uncharged. I think the battery for a 747 might be $300.00, that's expensive my friend.  I don't mess around with my marine batteries, I can't call CAA on the lake for a boost. I carry a booster pack for insurance.  CTC will check your battery at no charge."
909628,fish_fishburn,2015-04-12 16:20:00,1311,Trojan batteries are half that price and last just as long.
909639,Mister G,2015-04-12 16:39:00,1429,"Pros and cons when it comes to AGM batteries. IMHO I believe they are way over priced but if you don't mind being raked over the coals, go for it. It your money and if you think it's best for your purpose that is all that counts.  In my experience a good marine starting battery that is well maintained from day one should last you at least as long as your AGM. When I say well maintained, I mean having a on-board charger hooked up to that battery and all boat batteries whenever the boat is not out fishing.  My last marine dual purpose starting battery (wet cell) was replaced at 9 years old because it was 9 years old and I didn't want to push it on the Great Lakes. If I didn't fish the Great Lakes, who knows it might be still in my boat.  If you don't already have a on-board charger you should consider one and if you purchase a wet cell marine battery it will be free with the saving of not purchasing a AGM battery.  Now got to it and catch a fish"
909690,porkpie,2015-04-12 21:34:00,2521,"Pete, I'd go with the costco advice.  I've had great luck, and there is no way I'd spend that kinda cake on a starting battery.  Costco has an excellent starting/deep cycle unit for $120."
909728,ecmilley,2015-04-12 23:16:00,2163,"the agm batterys are nice but do require different chargers to get the most out of them, if your charger has been charging over 14.4vts can lead to longevity issues. as for use a regular dc or dp will work fine as a starting batterey and running a sonar all day. running a dc27 for starting on my ranger and it runs the bird up front the hds on console and my talon never a issue with starting after fishing 7-8 hrs with everything running"
909819,NANUK,2015-04-13 13:34:00,797,"7 years old ? You can try recharging it however slow or fast you want, chances are it will let you down on the water when you really need it. I would say time to replace the battery, Like mentioned above, no need to spend a lot of money for a cranking battery, get the biggest marine cranking amp battery for the physical size you require for the space you have, I prefer marine rated batteries for the boat, they stand to vibration in the boat better than car batteries."
909822,lew,2015-04-13 13:55:00,12766,I always carry a set of booster cables in the boat just in case my starting battery won't fire up my motor. Hook them up to a deep cycle and away you go.  And I can help another boater who may be stranded.
909824,BFSC Kevin,2015-04-13 14:05:00,1351,Same here.  I carry a set of booster cables in the boat.  Make sure they are long enough too..  Last year my starting batteries (at the back of the boat)  drained somehow and the jumper cables were too short to reach the front where the trolling motor deep cycle batteries were.  I could have brought the deep cycle further back to boost the starting batteries but I didn't want to bother untying everything and carrying it to the back.  So then I just used my kicker motor to get back to the launch.  Took about 15 minutes.  When I got back to the ramp I had longer jumper cables in the truck and I was able to boost the starting batteries no problem.
909825,BFSC Kevin,2015-04-13 14:08:00,1351,"I had three motors in the boat,  main,  kicker and trolling.  Booster cables in case.  It would really suck to be stuck on a big Lake and the weather turn bad... Like a storm rolling through on Lake O.."
909827,BillM,2015-04-13 14:28:00,17367,"I've killed the battery on my main I think twice..  Battery doesn't have enough juice to start the big motor, but it will start the kicker without issue.  I'll troll around at WOT on the kicker to charge the battery just enough to get the big motor going.  I haven't had this work around fail me yet"
909829,G.mech,2015-04-13 14:39:00,830,You have to be careful selecting cranking batteries for some of the modern high tech motors.  Many of them require very high cranking current batteries to prevent damage to the ECM.  I know the Optimax says minimum 1000 MCA (800CCA) battery which you won't get with a deep cycle or dual purpose AGM.   Just something to keep in mind if you're running any of these.
909830,irishfield,2015-04-13 14:58:00,26272,"What ^ he said. The Verado's battery is supposed to be dedicated to the motor and if you run it down below about 11.2 volts the computer will not attempt to start it (and you're not supposed to boost it). One of the (many) things I had to correct on my boats prewire in 2007 ...as they had the auto bilge pump and a lot of other things hooked to the main battery. All ""drain"" items are supposed to be on the kicker / accessory battery (that gets recharged through an isolator off the big motor, or the kicker). I have two 1080MCA AGM's in mine, that I made Lund pay for, and if they're good to go again this summer will be their 8th season, so I'm looking at $700 in the near future I bet."
909845,Lape0019,2015-04-13 16:09:00,647,"All good points here. I run interstates and replaced mine after 8 years in the boat. They were charged after every use but just like Mr G wrote, and I only changed it because I didn't want to get stranded.  I had left it at my Dads house and he decided to use it because his was toast. Guess what? left us stranded that very same year.  If you get 9 years out of a battery, is $300 a lot? I don't use AGM and doubt most of the responses on here were about AGMs but if you can afford it, it is almost worth it to not have to service them.  As for trickle charging the AGM, make sure your charger is rated for AGM batteries, many are not and it can really affect the battery."
909848,BillM,2015-04-13 16:24:00,17367,"If you're getting 8-9 years out of a normal lead acid battery that will use any charger, why bother with AGM?  What does AGM do better?  From what I've been reading, nothing."
909852,Mister G,2015-04-13 16:59:00,1429,"If you're getting 8-9 years out of a normal lead acid battery that will use any charger, why bother with AGM?  What does AGM do better?  From what I've been reading, nothing. Not sure if you will get that many years out of any charger that's why I recommended a on-board charger because they are smart chargers. However, some non on-board chargers very well may be smart chargers as well. Double check on that but then the charger should be hooked up and on charge at all times the battery is not being used. A on-board charger makes this so much easier because you only have to plug the charger in."
