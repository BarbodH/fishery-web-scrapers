When I say we, I paid for the materials and watched my pal make it. Fitting was the tough part but it wasn't rocket science. That included mounting the controls as well, electric start with throttle controls. That part I did. A bit of flat bar, stainless tubing and quick disconnects. Trial and error and now it works like a charm. A tiller shouldn't take much.  By the way I have dealt with Marine Max, he knows his stuff and is less per hour than most."
