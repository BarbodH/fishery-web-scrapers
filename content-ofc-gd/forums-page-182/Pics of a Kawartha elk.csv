814093,Old Ironmaker,2013-10-21 02:29:00,8243,"I haven't seen a rack like that since I was in the Piccadilly on Barton Street in Hamilton before it closed.  A farmer out here was raising them until someone opened the pens and they skedaddled. They didn't seem to thrive as none were sighted after the first year.  How can a few herds of Elk do as much damage to crops as the many, many flocks of Deer here in Ontario? Or maybe they do? A real question from a citiot once removed."
814138,jimmer,2013-10-21 15:08:00,2730,Thanks for sharing Lew. They will have to keep protecting them if they show themselves so easy. Do you know how many tags they give out a year for the Bancroft area?

814245,ch312,2013-10-22 01:33:00,1590," How can a few herds of Elk do as much damage to crops as the many, many flocks of Deer here in Ontario? Or maybe they do? A real question from a citiot once removed.  Going by the MNR, bull elk can weigh up to 1,100 lbs leading up to the rut (his prime weight/health for the year) and cows up to 550 lbs. In comparison a whitetail buck would be lucky to reach 300 lbs and a 150 lb doe would be a big one. Elk do more damage as they're 3 times larger and travel in larger groups than whitetail and each elk is the equivalent of 3 deer. They not only eat much more, but family that lives in the area claims many farmers are having their fences ruined by elk too."

I remember seeing a show on Elk hunting and it was discovered that the guides were drugging the elk so the hunters had an easy target. Can't remember where it was though, but they got caught."

An elk attacked and killed 4 cows? Did they say when this happened?  You'd think something like this would have made the news if it were true. I'm thinking the facts got a little mixed up by the time the story reached your ears. Maybe it was during the rut when Mr. Elk was confused and ended up giving the cows heart attacks after chasing them around all day trying to breed them?

As for the one Matt talked about in Ottawa yesterday, this mornings news reports that he was killed by police.  Yes, sad isn't it? Too often that is the result of wild animals straying into Ottawa. Last couple of years saw several moose shot as well. Maybe they should look into tranquilizing efforts instead of killing them."

812015,ch312,2013-10-10 14:10:00,1590,"What a great experience and pictures!  One of the few out there. They estimate there are maybe 600- 950 elk in whole province. Too bad when people just want to kill them when there are so few. MNR page,,,http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/FW/2ColumnSubPage/279012.html  Amazing sight of a majestic wild animal.  While the number of elk is below 1000 province wide, these animals are divided into 4-5 separate herds so they're basically bunched up in a few areas. All of the herds, except for the lake of the woods herd, have been growing every year and it looks like the reintroduction is going to be a success. Hopefully it goes as well as the turkey reintroduction did. It's hard to believe that in the late 80's there were no turkey in Ontario and in 2007 there were over 70,000 and likely closer to 100k now.  It's my understanding that the controlled hunt for elk was started in response to the many farmers who are having to deal with nuisance elk and the damage they're causing. There are only 70 tags available for the entire province each year and I'd think a 50% success rate is a conservative estimate meaning there may have been 100 elk shot by hunters in the last 3 seasons. Also, having an open season for the animal brings more publicity and money (through tags and the $15 each hunter pays just to enter the draw whether successful or not) which helps the herd as a whole.  Hunting is likely the most productive means of keep populations in check."

Elk were released in a few areas around Ontario back about 12 - 15 years ago and one of the places was Bancroft and they've evidently been spreading out since then. This guy is about 50 miles south of Bancroft.  I was talking to a local farmer and he said this fella has been hanging around the area all summer.  Here he is hanging out with a cow.    You can just make him out on the crest of the hill above the horses butt.      A close up    This big guy wanted more attention than the elk    This was the 1st elk I've ever seen and it's great to have him as a neighbor.  Hopefully nobody decides to kill him."

His antlers had to be at least 3' long and probably as wide at the top too.  Not sure about him causing trouble for the farmer though N.A.W. as this guy was laying back and soaking up the rays as if he owned the joint and didn't have a care in the world.  I don't know if there's many wolves around here to cause him any troubles but I did have one on my front lawn a year or so ago. Plenty of coyotes though, but I don't know if they'd go after a critter as big as an elk...or would they ??"

My buddy who lives up there is about 10miles from the original release site when they first brought them here !!!! He sees them all the time and had some great pics of them too !!!!! He has told me stories of when the MNR first starting Comming around to landowners and asking them about release sites he was one of them !!!! And they were worried about poachers back then and wanted landowners to be hush hush about them being there for a few years and wanted the owners to keep logbooks and sighting records !!! Pretty cool now they are established and doing great !!!! What a big majestic animal for sure !!!! And you are right about how big they actually are !!!! A lot bigger than a whitetail deer for sure !!! Both the elk I seen were males too with big racks !!! And the one was about 20feet off the side of the highway I thought it was a moose at first !!!! Awesome!!!! Glad to see they are in our area of the kawarthas !!!! There was one sighted in gooderham in the spring too and that's only 20mins  north of me !!!! Cool maybe I will see another one this winter on my sled !!!!

It is always cool to see them.  A stud bull Elk can easily be three to four times the size of an equally prime Whitetail Buck.  On our family trips out to BC and through Yellowstone, we would see them with same frequency as we or you see Whitetails here.  Hopefully the herds continue to grow.  A number of them have been lost to train collisions.  Cheers, Mark"
