Luckily for Canadians everywhere, there’s now a company willing to do just that. Woods Canada is looking for two adventurers to “hike, paddle, climb and camp” the Trans Canada Trail. The lucky winners will each be paid $20,000 for the five-month gig, plus just over $5,000 in spending money with the additional possibility of a $2,000 bonus. The best news is, there really doesn’t seem to be a catch. The adventure would run from May 12 to September 30, 2015, and the only thing you’re really expected to do other than explore is document your journey by taking videos and photos (but wouldn’t you be doing that anyway?). And if you’re not a rugged, piss-and-vinegar type outdoorsman, don’t worry about it. The position only calls for basic skills in hiking, climbing, paddling and portaging. “More extreme disciplines like technical mountain climbing or canoeing through rapids will NOT be a requirement for this job,” the description reads. In fact, professional guides will be deployed to help escort the explorers through some of the more challenging locations. All related travel and accommodation costs will also covered. To apply, all you need to do is submit a one-minute video stating why you’re the best person for the job, along with your resume. The deadline is April 17. So what are you waiting for? The adventure of a lifetime is just clicks away!  Here is the link: https://www.woodsdreamjob.com/JobDetails/"

Anyone I know who has done the coast to coast trip, by car,  forever cherishes that experience. I can just imagine how wonderful this experience would be."
