909466,bigugli,2015-04-11 21:45:00,6138,Local scrap yards usually buy and sell scrap lead. That is my main source for all my pouring.
909470,ketchenany,2015-04-11 22:42:00,3229,"When I started in the typesetting business we melted lead  by the ton, and I means ton, to make fonts. The smoke was heavy and never thought of it to be deadly  Today those fonts are getting very expensive to collectors and designers  I have a few in my collection.  I Belive they had to clean up the Canada Metal site because of the amount of lead they handled.  be careful with it."
