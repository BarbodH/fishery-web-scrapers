909025,lew,2015-04-09 14:48:00,12766,"I joined this board 13 years ago and still remember the 1st thread I read was about PowerPro. I'd never tried it on my musky reels but it sounded good so I bought a spool and liked it so much it went on all my other reels too.  Never seen anything better and have never had a reason to try anything else....if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
909110,fishindevil,2015-04-09 19:35:00,6254,I have tried super 8 several times and the suffix and most brands and I still prefer the original Power pro !!!! It's on almost all my setups for eyes & bass !!!! It just plain works and holds up just as good or better than any other top money braid I believe !!!!! Yes it fades & frays but they all do as well and like bill said unspool it turn it around and get another season out of it !!!! Change mine every year or 2 !!!!!
909159,AdamS,2015-04-09 23:31:00,161,"I agree with fishindevil. I used to use power pro, then went to the super 8, then needed to respool and went back to the original power pro and remembered theres no reason to change what works well already. Stuck with it ever since."
909169,bare foot wader,2015-04-10 00:31:00,1354,"I was working at walmart when they first received power pro, I setup the hooks for it and thought it looked cool, never seen it before and bought some that day, almost a game changer I'd say....I was immediately a big fan and while I don't mind trying new stuff, power pro is always my go to braid  the other 2 regulars I buy are nanofil and fireline crystal, usually for lighter spinning applications"
909187,Steve,2015-04-10 01:56:00,2075,"i have power pro backing (and maybe even some old fins prt) on old leadcore reels that must be approaching 10 years old....  believe it or not, it still works just fine...i use that leadcore for kings and trout each year, as well as walleye...never have an issue with the line....  now, with that said, I don't cast with that line....  but as far as backing goes, it seems to last forever."
909188,Lape0019,2015-04-10 02:01:00,647,"I find super slick has its place in time. For the most part, I sti run regular PP on most of my reels. I would never run Super slick for pitching but it works great on my Jerkbait rod."
909269,aznphil,2015-04-10 15:17:00,73,in my limited exp. sunline ssx doesnt fade nearly as much as pp or suffix...but hard to find.  Does anyone kjnow where i can get spools of less thatn 16lb test?
909330,Roe Bag,2015-04-10 23:39:00,246,"Feeling like a high jacker again but, anybody ever tie up harnesses with braid? Do a lot of early season walleye fishing. Weedlines in shallow bays. Lots of pike around.  They saw right through 14 & 17 lb mono. Thinking tying some up using braid. Hoping this might prevent being bit off. Wondering if it may be too visible. Appreciate your thoughts. Thanks in advance."
909331,davey buoy,2015-04-10 23:41:00,5505,"Power pro regular for has worked for me for years,and I don't change the line.Mind you,but I get out maybe 25-30 times a year but full 8-10 hours a day.Would the super 8 be better for a spinning or bait caster?Have two options,would like to give it a go,one or the other in your opinion."
909334,manitoubass2,2015-04-10 23:46:00,11391, It works. Seems kinda weird but it works.  I still prefer 20lb flouro though by a wide margin.  No mono for me I hate the stuff
909335,adam lancia,2015-04-10 23:48:00,234,"Super 8 Slick would be better suited to spinning reels, however, I will be using some 20# or 30# with a fluoro leader on a Daiwa PX68L for jerkbaits this year."
909351,Roe Bag,2015-04-11 01:42:00,246,Ive used braid to make harnesses.  It works. Seems kinda weird but it works.  I still prefer 20lb flouro though by a wide margin.  No mono for me I hate the stuff Tried 20 lb. Sunline Super Fluorocarbon on a batch last year. Found that there was too much memory. On several the snell on the bottom hook didn't hold. Probably should have left a longer tag end. I'll be tying up a batch for opener. I'll make sure I mix it up a bit. Fluoro and braid. See where it goes. Thanks for the reply.
909352,BillM,2015-04-11 01:49:00,17367,"Power pro regular for has worked for me for years,and I don't change the line.Mind you,but I get out maybe 25-30 times a year but full 8-10 hours a day.Would the super 8 be better for a spinning or bait caster?Have two options,would like to give it a go,one or the other in your opinion.  Depending on what you're fishing Nanofil on the spinning setup."
909353,manitoubass2,2015-04-11 01:50:00,11391,"Its real weird with braid. Youll see what I mean, its just a very different feeling.  I cant remember what strengths ive tried but i think 8lb or maybe 10lb was good. Too high and the blades spin funny"
909358,Sinker,2015-04-11 02:38:00,8692,"I dont like the super 8, or super slick whatever its called. Regular power pro for me.  Harnesses I use 20lb mono. Braid will slice off quicker than mono.  S."
909464,Joeytier,2015-04-11 21:41:00,3990,"Yep.  If you're getting bit off that much, switch to fluorocarbon leader material, tougher than mainline.  I hate tying harnesses with thick mono, so I stick with 8 lb xl or xt and accept that I'm going to get bit off once in a while lol"
909474,Sinker,2015-04-11 22:57:00,8692,My harnesses wouldnt last an outing tied in 8lb...for real!  S.
908757,gaspumper,2015-04-08 03:39:00,393,Anybody been using the Power Pro Super 8 Slick braid ? Pros or cons.
908760,manitoubass2,2015-04-08 03:52:00,11391,"Stick to the original.  Until power pro can somehow fuse with nanofil , the original is the best out there imo"
908771,Joeytier,2015-04-08 05:21:00,3990,"Yep, original PP is still the best braid on the market for my money."
908772,mike rousseau,2015-04-08 05:22:00,4661,I've been told it cast far by guys I've fished with...
908779,Gallie,2015-04-08 11:36:00,1215,"I tried it, i didnt like it. I love my original pp"
908783,ecmilley,2015-04-08 12:10:00,2163,I like it will cast a country mile drawbacks seem to be morenwind knots.
908791,BillM,2015-04-08 12:40:00,17367,"I've used it on one of my Calais, a lot better then Suffix 832, I find it doesn't tip wrap like that stuff.  Still pretty limp though."
908802,musky_hunter,2015-04-08 13:42:00,328,Sunline SX1 and FX2 is also great line. Smooth and round.
908814,manitoubass2,2015-04-08 14:39:00,11391," Back to the original PP I went  Then I tried the pp superslick and it was pretty good, i didnt think it was better the pp.  Then I spooled up another baitcaster and it was awesome. Like what the hell?  Imo these companies have serious qc issues"
908815,manitoubass2,2015-04-08 14:41:00,11391,Oh and to stick to the op  Major con for me is too smooth through the drag on a baitcaster.  Maybe its just me(and moosebunk) i like to hear my drag
908816,Roe Bag,2015-04-08 14:58:00,246,"Not to high jack, but how does Sufix 832 compare to Power Pro on spinning gear?"
908823,manitoubass2,2015-04-08 15:22:00,11391,Pp is better
908825,BillM,2015-04-08 15:23:00,17367,"Pp is better  Yup, I'd pick normal PP over 832 on spinning gear as well.  On my spinning setups they either get Nanofil or FC."
908832,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-08 16:01:00,937,Question... How often do you guys change your PP?
908837,BillM,2015-04-08 16:07:00,17367,Every 2-3 years.  Gotta remember you've got brand new un-used line against the spool...  So once a season just reverse the line...
908859,Paudash,2015-04-08 17:30:00,273,every 2-3 years
908864,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-08 18:07:00,937,"Thanks, my pp has started to change colour and fray."
908907,Roe Bag,2015-04-08 21:57:00,246,"Pp is better   Yup, I'd pick normal PP over 832 on spinning gear as well.  On my spinning setups they either get Nanofil or FC.   Thanks guys."
908917,manitoubass2,2015-04-08 23:04:00,11391,No prob. Nanofil is deadly if abrasion isnt an issue  It super sensitive dental floss that cast a country mile lol
908956,Bubbleboy,2015-04-09 01:58:00,3,"Works fine, not sure I'd say it's outstanding. It's soft so it tend to tangle around the tip of the rod. Appears to fray slightly easier than the original"
908957,mattaw,2015-04-09 02:12:00,162,"I like it. It's really loud though, and wind knots from time to time. There are great braids on the market that I like more though. Sunline makes great line, as does Seaguar. Smackdown is expensive, but a hell of a braid"
908960,Dan668,2015-04-09 02:23:00,1120,"I hated super 8, preferred regular PP. Or my favourites sx1/fx2 or seaguars smackdown"
908980,206,2015-04-09 10:15:00,563,I'm no pro but have rods spooled with both PPSS8 and sufix braid and think both work the same. Tuffline thats another story stay away from that stuff lol
908995,adam lancia,2015-04-09 12:04:00,234,"I'm a fan of Super 8 Slick on my spinning reels, as well as Sufix 832. I'm going to be trying S8S on a couple of baitcasters this season too."
909019,FrankTheRabbit,2015-04-09 14:13:00,479,"Anyone had the chance to try out Gamma Torque? A bit on the pricey side, but I know a lot of people who miss using Gamma mono on their float reels."
