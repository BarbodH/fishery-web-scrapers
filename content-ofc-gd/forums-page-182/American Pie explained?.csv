908774,Terry,2015-04-08 09:02:00,14456,"I would want him to explain, not everyone guessing but I have always put my own meaning to the song"
908892,DaveRoach,2015-04-08 20:32:00,202,Song was written about Buddy Holly's plane crash if I remember right.
908900,Terry,2015-04-08 21:32:00,14456,that is a part of it but there is much more
908902,bigugli,2015-04-08 21:34:00,6138,"  It starts there, but becomes a running story line on growing up in the midst of the turbulent 60's, and ends with the shift in the music scene from the east coast, and New York, to the San Francisco scene ""taking the last train for the coast""."
909023,wkrp,2015-04-09 14:39:00,656,I never really cared for that song so I couldnt care less.
909393,Mister G,2015-04-11 14:13:00,1429,And to think when it first came out radio stations played a shorted version of it because they thought it was too long and no one would listen to it from start to end.  It's definitely one song that has endured the test of time as kids today love it as much as the kids of the 70's not to mention a lot of old farts that still listen to it every time it's on the old am car radio.
