904607,bigugli,2015-03-19 03:32:00,6138,"For a while I was beginning to think that grandchildren might not be in the cards. Truth be known, considering my daughter's spinal history, I was OK with that. Well the daughter will be due in three month and I was still a little hesitant in how I felt. Today, the son drops a real bomb. Apparently I might be looking at 4 grandchildren before Christmas.!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was kinda in shock for a few hours. Boy is life going to get expensive. There won't be no shortage of fishing buddies for me in the future."

904610,bigugli,2015-03-19 03:55:00,6138," He's been getting serious with a young lady for some time, and she has 2 little ones, and now, apparently, one more of Jr's doing on the way.  Instant big family."
904611,irishfield,2015-03-19 03:58:00,26272,That's not getting serious.. that's forgetting the wrapping!  I picked up a granddaughter 1.5 years ago.. she's now 17!
904613,bigugli,2015-03-19 04:02:00,6138,  Lol!
904618,ketchenany,2015-03-19 10:46:00,3229, Tell me about it Bruce I have 7 and another on the way.  Yes they are expensive. Very expensive.

904626,Mister G,2015-03-19 11:31:00,1429,"Congratulations on all your new and expected grandchildren.  My wife thought the same as you, but 2014 brought us not one but two granddaughters to spoil.  Tomorrow we leave to celebrate a first birthday and then head down to see the other granddaughter's Christening. Good times ahead.  Expensive........no..........I considered money well spent."
909783,bigugli,2015-04-13 03:06:00,6138,"First fishing outing with the 2 little girls.  After all the rain, and mud the prey weren't too cooperative. The youngest managed her very first fish, a crappie. That was it, but they played, ran around, and honked back at the geese as they were swimming by. They sure love playing in the minnow bucket."
909787,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-13 03:17:00,8243,"Wonderful news Bruce, congrats. I once saw one of the most bang on bumper stickers ever, it said.  ""If there is life after death I want to come back as my parents Grandchild""  Spoil them all I say."
909790,bigugli,2015-04-13 03:42:00,6138,"  I just read this again, and now I can't get this dirty soldier's ditty about socks out of my mind. Lol."
909812,bigbuck,2015-04-13 12:52:00,2449,"Expensive??? Who cares!!! The joy that they bring to the family is PRICELESS. I see how happy my folks are with the kids around. One thing though, instead of expensive gifts and whatnot, a trip to Timmies for a hot chocolate and a timbit and going to the park. That makes the kids happier than anything. Not to mention going fishing and playing with a bucket'o panfish. Spend TIME with them, forget about money. A little kid is just as happy playing with a cardboard box than an expensive toy. Enjoy them Bruce.  Bruce"

Sandy beach in summer, snow in winter, ducks to feed on the river----what's not to like! Simple and cheap entertainment. The   5 year old said ""I like it here. We should come more often!"""
