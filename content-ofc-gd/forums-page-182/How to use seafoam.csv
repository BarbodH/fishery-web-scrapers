909622,Mister G,2015-04-12 16:07:00,1429,And it's only 10X as much as expensive gasoline that everyone complains about.  Anyone here know what Seafoam is made from ? ? ?
909683,aplumma,2015-04-12 21:19:00,6896,here is a link to the MSDS sheet it accounts for 75% of its composition the missing 25% are considered not hazardous to humans.  http://seafoamsales.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/MSDS_seafoam_EN.pdf  No matter what you decide either to use it or not your engine will know the difference.   Art
909692,Mister G,2015-04-12 21:50:00,1429,Here's what I found that's in Seafoam......notice the dreaded alcohol that is now in gasoline and water.  50% light hydrocarbon oil (pale oil); 30% petroleum naphtha; 10% isopropyl alcohol; 10% water.
909700,Freshtrax,2015-04-12 22:11:00,2215,Wrong alcohol.   Isopropyl is more like a solvent. Ethanol is in gas.
909708,davey buoy,2015-04-12 22:32:00,5505,"Wrong alcohol. Isopropyl is more like a solvent. Ethanol is in gas. If I'm correct,that is what gas line anti freeze is.?."
909710,Freshtrax,2015-04-12 22:36:00,2215,Yup.
908916,sneak_e_pete,2015-04-08 23:03:00,540,I have a Yamaha F20 and want to run some seafoam through it.  Do you just add it to the gas 2oz per gallon?
908926,ketchenany,2015-04-08 23:54:00,3229,that's what I do with my mower and snowblower.
908929,Consigliere,2015-04-09 00:00:00,121,It's a decarb mainly so can do a few things. What you are doing is for just general preventative measures. This is to clear up some rough running motors or a couple times per year.  Spray it into cylinders. Soak for a bit. Run engine.  Run engine spray into carbs until engine starts to big down. Let run for a while again. Repeat.  The shock method using gas is mix 3 litres with a whole can and run that through the engine.
908941,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-09 00:39:00,10439,It can also be added to the crankcase to clean the lower end. You have to change the oil afterward though.  I generally run a can in a full (18 gallon) tank of fuel once or twice a year to keep the fuel system clean.
908946,kickingfrog,2015-04-09 01:00:00,8333,What if the gas has already been treated with a stabilizer? I always put some stabilizer in the gasoline when I buy it but if I'm going to run seafoam should I skip it?
908951,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-09 01:34:00,10439,"No problem, I use stabilizer in every motor I own except my truck as it doesn't last nearly as long."
908958,Sinker,2015-04-09 02:16:00,8692,I use seafoam as a stabilizer. 3-4oz (I just eyeball it) per tank.  For a good de-carbon I run a full can thru 20L of fuel. I do that in the late fall.  S.
908999,ecmilley,2015-04-09 12:22:00,2163,instructions are on the bottle for use.
909008,lookinforwalleye,2015-04-09 12:53:00,4399,I had a issue with a check engine light in the Jeep in the fall and a can of Seafoam fixed that!!!
909317,fishindevil,2015-04-10 21:35:00,6254,I run it in my Yamaha 50hp four stroke outboard & my snowmobile too as well as snowblower and you can mix it several ways as guys have already said !!! Been using it for years no issues with anything ..... I run it  every other tank or so and use it as stabilizer as well during the winter too
909336,Regan Thompson,2015-04-10 23:51:00,80,We use for yearly maintenance on our rental 9.9 two stroke motors as follows: 
909383,Mister G,2015-04-11 13:06:00,1429,If you're not having any problems why waist your money on Seafoam. Don't fix what's not broken.
909423,bigbuck,2015-04-11 18:06:00,2449,Just add to the gas to help keep the cylinder heads and valves clean. Do it for a tank or two now at the beginning of the season and do again at end of season so next year you are good to go with no work to do on your boat.
909468,Joeytier,2015-04-11 21:54:00,3990,I guess I'm a sucker for wasting about 5 whole dollars pre year for easy preventative maintenance on all my motors.  Just put about half a can in snowmobile for its last tank of the season.  Hopefully burn it all tomorrow and she'll be ready to fog for the summer.
909476,moxie,2015-04-11 23:11:00,1566,I run it in my Yamaha 50hp four stroke outboard & my snowmobile too as well as snowblower and you can mix it several ways as guys have already said !!! Been using it for years no issues with anything ..... I run it every other tank or so and use it as stabilizer as well during the winter too X2 but in an oil inj 2 stroke. Never an issue.
909478,ecmilley,2015-04-11 23:21:00,2163,I love people that dont stabilize fuel or do any preventative maintenance  gonna help pay for the two legend extremes and alderbarons coming my way
909487,Smokercrafty,2015-04-12 00:28:00,227,X2.........
909491,Sinker,2015-04-12 00:40:00,8692," Its called preventative maintenance. Pay a little now, or a lot later. Your choice. Im running a '93 2 stroke that has never run fuel with no stabilizer, and been seafoamed every fall. Not a single issue in all those years. Still runs like new.  S."
909535,HTHM,2015-04-12 04:02:00,4082,"Its called preventative maintenance. Pay a little now, or a lot later. Your choice. Im running a '93 2 stroke that has never run fuel with no stabilizer, and been seafoamed every fall. Not a single issue in all those years. Still runs like new.  S. That is also why my Jetta is over 300000 Km trouble free without excess oil consumption between regularly scheduled oil and timing belt changes. (Darn I just jinxed myself)"
909537,Freshtrax,2015-04-12 04:25:00,2215,I don't believe in snake oils for motors. But seafoam is the real deal.   Coming from a certified gear head ex mechanic.
909540,fishindevil,2015-04-12 08:25:00,6254,Yes it just plain works !!! And with today's garbage corn gas !!!! Why take a chance !!!! Like I said as well never an issue using it and will continue !!!! Even top notch marine mechanics who build & repair high end engines & outboards swear by it and use it in their own engines as well !!!! Example I had a used snowblower would not start or stay running figured it had old gas in it for a long time drained out the old gas put about an oz or 2 in it with about 1/2 liter of gas first I let the seafoam sit in it for a day cranked it over a few times added the gas and it started right up and ran great !!!! Just one example of how well it's worked for me !!! To each their own I guess ....
909576,aplumma,2015-04-12 13:32:00,6896,"As some know I restore old motorcycles, cars and small engines just as a hobby and the number of carburetors I have rebuilt is in the hundreds now. The size of the jets and the passages in a carb. can be clogged by poor fuel and ethanol quickly. If you haven't been inside of a carb the passages as well as the jets are in some cases as small as a hairbrush bristle. The amount of sludge that i remove from the bottom of the float bowls that have been put away wet without stabilizer is just sick. I use stabilizers in all of my engines that will have gas sitting in it for longer than 3 weeks. The others get treated twice a year. For a motorcycle RnR on a carb set is usually $300.oo that buys  stabilizers for many a year.  Art"
909583,ecmilley,2015-04-12 13:57:00,2163,Have used it for years and the only thing better for cleaning is mopar combustion cleaner but that really is only for use by people in the industry and thats all it does is decarbonize. Use seafoam as preventitive maintenenace and stabilizer in everything i own boats car truck sleds lawnmower chainsaw trimmer ect all start and run perfect everyspring and fall. had a polaris sled wrapped up in yard for two years without use but stabilized with seafoam started on 5 th pull ran good for rest of winter no issues. the people that don't use it esp in 2 stroke stuff those carb jets will slowly close up with grunge and dirt from ethanol so when your thinking this is the best my 9.9 has ever run usually means your about to have a lean meltdown of a piston or two
909612,Freshtrax,2015-04-12 15:30:00,2215,Anyone know where to buy it buy the gallon?
909615,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-12 15:33:00,8243,I'm told by a pal that is a chemist at the Nanticoke refinery that by the time a tank of regular gas in the car is on the bottom 1/4 it is already breaking down. unless you are going through a tank or more a week. So that tells me how important it is to treat fuel in the boat. Cheap insurance and peace of mind for me. My neighbour takes my old plugs and puts them in his engine.
