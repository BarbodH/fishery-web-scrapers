909701,leaf4,2015-04-12 22:13:00,2466,What a piece of art that is! Very nicely done
909703,lew,2015-04-12 22:21:00,12766,"Beautiful work Bernie, looks brand new."
909705,aplumma,2015-04-12 22:27:00,6896,Looking good Bernie   Art
909706,davey buoy,2015-04-12 22:30:00,5505,"Awesome work Bernie,better than new!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
909715,Viking,2015-04-12 22:44:00,39,Very nice. I'm impressed.
909720,esoxansteel,2015-04-12 23:09:00,1307,"Pete might want it back now, good for another 50 years"
909722,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-12 23:11:00,8243,"Another piece of artwork. The details you reproduced are fantastic. Rip across the lake, that is great, just don't get it wet.  If you would like to see some other great restorations of old kickers stop by Proctor Marine in Simcoe. Mr. Hayington has done many and is still at it. I think their website has a section showing them but seeing them in person is best. It's like a museum of old engines."
909723,moxie,2015-04-12 23:12:00,1566,Thats a beauty. Very nice work.
909777,captpierre,2015-04-13 02:24:00,2521,Can I send you my wife?
909780,Joeytier,2015-04-13 02:49:00,3990,:0  Fantastic job on the restoration.
909796,wormdunker,2015-04-13 07:43:00,1711,"Very nice Bernie.  I see it has a decal saying ""electric start"".  Was electric start common back then?"
909801,Roy,2015-04-13 09:03:00,13728,The first electric start outboard was manufactured by Evinrude in 1930. I don't imagine they were very popular in those years mostly due to the depression.  Excellent work Bernie. Very impressive.
909808,kickingfrog,2015-04-13 11:53:00,8333,Perfect for the transom of a Giesler cedar strip.
909810,bigbuck,2015-04-13 12:43:00,2449,"Looks fantastic Bernie!! It should be run, not just displayed. Not thrashed mind you, but run."
909815,mepps,2015-04-13 13:05:00,1301,"Impressive work, looks great!"
909817,wkrp,2015-04-13 13:24:00,656,A real nice piece of Canadian  Restoration.
909820,Ralph Field,2015-04-13 13:51:00,1018,Very nice. I'm impressed. x2
909821,BFSC Kevin,2015-04-13 13:55:00,1351,"It's a beaut,  Bernie!"
909870,Smokercrafty,2015-04-13 17:58:00,227, Good job on the resto!  That 2 piece lower unit looks like a breeze compared to nowadays. I have one where I can't get the gears out due to a seized bushing. May have to sacrafice the housing and cut it in two.   :-(
909876,paul_614,2015-04-13 18:38:00,168,One word. WOW
909888,Bernie,2015-04-13 18:52:00,3190,Thanks for the comments folks. Thought about the wife rebuild but it may cause trouble  The old girl will get on a transom again this year. The electric start is handy as it has good compression and is a good tug on the rope when it's cool out.  I'd like to get a pair of them done up and run twin engines. Have another but not electric so need to do some parts searching. It's all part of the fun.
909897,Blue Lk,2015-04-13 19:38:00,337,Another GREAT job Bernie.
909906,misfish,2015-04-13 20:57:00,29133,BEAUTIFUL  Very nice Bernie.
909924,AdamS,2015-04-13 22:57:00,161,Nicely done
