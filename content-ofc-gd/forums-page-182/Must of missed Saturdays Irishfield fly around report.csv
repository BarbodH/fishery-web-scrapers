There was, plenty of open water to fish. Tie up some floating roe bags and get heading.  Caught my morning sunrise in the rear view.LOL     To my surprise, all that ice I could see way out there on Friday,was blown in.        There was just enough  open water to wet a line though. I have not used this rod in probly 35 years. 12ft 2pc lamiglas. Figured it was doing no good just tucked away collecting dust, so rigged it up. Still love using it.    Gave it a couple hours then I got a call that I was needed at work again.Always the way. No biggie though. They paid for my gas.LOL  HAPPY EASTER SUNDAY ALL          "
908205,SirCranksalot,2015-04-05 16:05:00,3291,Not to worry. SE winds on Mon will take it back out. It'll prob melt before it can drift back in. Did you check the pump house?
