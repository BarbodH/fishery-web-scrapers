I was in Navy League Cadets in the 50's, Sea Cadets in the early 60's and then the Navy.

Whether you wish to accept it or not. Canada is involved in an undeclared war. It is neither intelligent or right to allow our service personnel to play the part of clay pigeons for the Jihadists while they have a free hand inflicting harm when and where they will with impunity.

Public tain't too bright. The replicas should have been transported in a better manner and fashion such as a weapons crate. I was a sea cadet and reservist. I do not see a cadet doing ceremonial drill as a bad image, nor small arms training at the range. That said, when drill or parade was done, weapons were immediately stored and away by the numbers. We did not use dummy weapons. As cadets we carried Enfields with spiked bayonet. CPO and guard PO carried a duty cutlass. There were no weapons incidents or accidents because weapons handling was heavily regulated and controlled by commissioned officers."

Sometimes its better to look at the root causes of stuff rather than constantly treat the symptoms. Would you rather change your diet or take medication for your diabetes for the rest of your life? Maybe we should look into rehabilitating people rather than locking them away and having them stew in their own angst for several years. Not saying they shouldn't be punished, but you can't just lock someone up for an extended period of time and expect them to come out as a functioning member of society. These people get to this stage in their lives for a reason. They feel like outcasts or they feel like they don't have a purpose. Joining ISIS or any other terrorist organization definitely gives them a purpose. Look at the Nazis in WWII. Hell, look at the rest of the world at that time. We just thought we had a more noble cause.  But no, the easy answer is to arm everyone and shoot or imprison anyone who looks suspicious or dares to believe in the wrong god...

Nathan Cirillo's unit is out of  is 1/2 block from the social club where I am a member and several of the soldiers out of there stop in for a coffee. I asked that exact same question to a few  military officer's that stopped in the club around the time of this trgedy. They all said they do not want any soldiers especially reservists with live ammunition in any civilian areas unless in the time of war. If a firefight broke out with a member of the military on Canadian soil and an innocent member of the civilian population were ever injured or killed, he called it collateral damage, it would put the military back decades. The military spends millions on public relations because a strong favourable opinion by the public results in loosening the purse strings by polititians for military budgets.  Imagine the public outcry if any civilians were killed that day or any day in fact by any soldier let alone a reservist? I know reservists are just as qualified, most civilians might not.
