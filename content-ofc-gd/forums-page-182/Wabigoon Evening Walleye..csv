ROLOFF AND ME STAYED ON AND CAUGHT A FEW                                       VIDEO     Great little session, good to get a bite in front of the house again, saves on gas!  Fish were in 9' FOW, 1/8 oz  fire tiger jigs and small minnows. They hit the set line and when jigging.  Perch was clear of worms which was nice."

The weather is warming up fast, and its been windy and rainy, half the 2' of ice is honeycomb on our lake….not long now, regular beginning week of May Ice Out………….maybe sooner."
