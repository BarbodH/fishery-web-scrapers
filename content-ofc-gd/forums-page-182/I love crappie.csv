909881,porkpie,2015-04-13 18:42:00,2521,"There is darn near everything in the grand, but I have not caught crappie in Fergus.  I suspect that you saw a guy who doesn't know much about seasons.  There is always one or two guys who think trout opens when the river breaks free of ice!"
909886,Acountdeleted,2015-04-13 18:48:00,2562,Oh man. Might be time for some recon. You guys are making me hungry.
909887,Gallie,2015-04-13 18:50:00,1215,"I finally got into a few slabs of my own in the yard, the competition has been fierce with up to 10 boats in about a 100 foot section but ive been holding my own so far  My first time scratching backround lol Pretty easy actually"
909894,jimmer,2015-04-13 19:30:00,2730," Pannies have always been the spring ritual for me. Crappie, gills, perch. The one question I would ask. Just how many of us owned computers 20 years back, and how much time did we spend online back then? I mentioned it because I used to be the only guy out there in April looking for panfish, a few people would yell at me that the fishing season wasn't open yet, but they didn't really know the regs, it was all about walleye then. Then the crappie moved in and everything changed; I'm lucky to get on one of the spots now. LOL"
908496,bigugli,2015-04-07 02:01:00,6138,"Nothing says spring like crappie fishing. 2 solid outings over Easter with some great results. Bite tended to be slow, but they were there. Bucktail jigs lightly twitched under a float have been very effective. Lots of good sized crappie in the 9-11"" range. Maybe 5 dinks in all. had a couple of large OOS surprises, especially the 36""(appx) pike the son landed on 2lb line. Still can't load pics. That will have to wait for the new computer."
908508,BillM,2015-04-07 03:07:00,17367,"Good job!  Still no open water on my crappie spots up here.  Patiently waiting, lol."
908512,kickingfrog,2015-04-07 03:53:00,8333,Not patiently waiting here.
908513,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-07 03:54:00,2582,Jealous here Bruce. I was in Bobcaygeon and one of my spring crappie spots literally has no water   That's how low they have let the water get.
908527,Gallie,2015-04-07 12:15:00,1215,I think i got at least another week or 2 before im starting but im sure ready for em!
908530,ecmilley,2015-04-07 12:28:00,2163,most of my crappie spots are exposed mud right now. thanks for sharing
908531,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-07 12:31:00,937,I would love to catch some slab crappies but I only know spots that have dinks
908545,AKRISONER,2015-04-07 13:15:00,5558,what is going on in the kawarthas that the water is so low?
908554,bigugli,2015-04-07 13:46:00,6138,"  It has happened before. They lower the lake levels and lock levels in anticipation of a predicted snow load and it's following runoff.  If it does not materialize, you are stuck with water bodies below the norm. It's a guessing game. They would do the same thing on Six mile Lake as a reservoir for Gloucester Pool on the Severn system. Some of the shallower channels would end up impassable. Realistically, we only really saw one month of solid accumulation. That was February. January was snow and melt, and most of March was just dry."
908611,mattybculp,2015-04-07 18:02:00,388,"My crappie spots are a couple weeks away, but that water level better come up, as all my spots on chemong and buck are dry right now."
908620,netminder,2015-04-07 18:26:00,514,"Anybody want to give up some hints as to where some good crappie (or perch) spots are near Fergus? Not GPS coordinates for where to throw my line, but just some general ideas so I can get my line wet. Still new to the area and doing all I can to observe the locals. Today I saw someone with a spinning rod on the bridge over the Grand at Scotland Street. Didn't think that stretch of river would hold anything considering its pretty much locked in with dams. I know a lot of people go to Guelph Lake and Belwood Lake and Island Lake in Orangeville for ice fishing, but I'm not sure the ice is completely out at those places."
908635,ecmilley,2015-04-07 19:35:00,2163,need some pics couple from last year sturgeon lake crapollas. [/url]  
908637,ecmilley,2015-04-07 19:41:00,2163, this one is 2013. 
908788,can u fish,2015-04-08 12:30:00,326,I do not have that problem we are still ice fishing for crappie here just North of Parry Sound.  Cheers Mitch..
908805,jimmer,2015-04-08 13:59:00,2730,"Just think, 20 or so years ago no one talked about crappie. Now you can't keep people away from them. LOL"

908810,bigugli,2015-04-08 14:28:00,6138,Had another good evening chasing crappie. Lot of smaller ones this time. Some big bull Bluegills started moving in as well.
908812,BillM,2015-04-08 14:35:00,17367,Any idea what type of water temps you're seeing?
908818,ehg,2015-04-08 15:01:00,2666,"  The one question I would ask. Just how many of us owned computers 20 years back, and how much time did we spend online back then?  There were very few crappies in the Kawarthas and most of Ontario 20 yrs. ago except bit of  Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay around Severn area. White crappie in Welland area then as well. About 15 yrs. ago the black crappie exploded through Kawarthas, etc. Caught my first Kawartha crappie on Pigeon incidentally in 1997. It  was a 15 incher. They have been much smaller since."

Love the big gills Bruce. If I'm catching them I don't keep any crappie. I find the flesh a little firmer and just like the taste better.
908833,bigugli,2015-04-08 16:02:00,6138,  We did not have any real runoff yet in the channel and the bay is iced over still. But I think the temp may be close to 40F. Fingers weren't freezing when I was dipping my hands in.
908843,limeyangler,2015-04-08 16:27:00,5204,"Great stuff Bruce, sounds like a lot of fun, the crappie have exploded here on Wabigoon Lake, looking forward to ice out too myself!"
908845,manitoubass2,2015-04-08 16:35:00,11391,Dont be afraid to look shallow.  At 43 degrees ive marked them in the thousands in 6-8 fow
