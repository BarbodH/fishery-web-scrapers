909196,BillM,2015-04-10 02:43:00,17367,"that's a little harder to do with a 20lb - 40+ incher bill. once they get that big they go in the muskie net.  I've had no problems with a lot of fish over 40in with this technique, I actually find they don't flop around and lose their minds compared to if I got them under the chin, or even in the net..  Although if we've got a cradle in the boat, that's the preferred method."
909249,Gallie,2015-04-10 14:01:00,1215,"I find nothing calms a big gator down like sliding her into the cradle and leaving her and the cradle in the water. Pop the hooks out, quick pic and a way she goes."

909011,Shloim,2015-04-09 13:19:00,515,I have a couple pairs of the green and blue X Zone(I think) pliers in my boat and bag. They are around $14 at CT and cut all kinds of line and float and have got me out of plenty of jams. Likely the one fishing product I'm most happy with!
909012,Shloim,2015-04-09 13:27:00,515,"Oh and btw I've caught dozens of fair sized tothy guys. But vividly remember my first it was on mississippi lake near Perth and this was a small pike that almost made my cry. I asked an older man to help me with my tail between my legs....the hook was deep and it's teeth were showing and my pliers were tiny. He made it look super easy and basically said ""no worries"" although I know he was calling me a pansy under his breath"
909118,msp,2015-04-09 19:58:00,1336,I have found over the years that its the smaller pike that pose the biggest risk to the angler. The larger fish seem more intimidating but are much easier to handle. We have never used a net in all my years of pike fishing. The nets are a pain in the a$$ when the fish rolls around and gets tangled in the line and the lure gets snagged ect....
909120,Raf,2015-04-09 20:05:00,3495,"i agree with msp it's the small ones that'll get you.  i found the best way is to just shake em off boatside, if tehy wont come off grab them 'over the top' just behind the gills in order to get the hooks out."
909122,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-09 20:23:00,8243,"I used to grab Pike behind the head and was admonished by a very experienced fisherman to stop. He said the back bone could be broken easily and the fish will die, especially hammer handles. Good point. When I first fished for Pike grabbing them by the eyes is what I was taught. This was back when we kept all of them to eat. Thinking back that was a terrible thing to do and it still bothers me today thinking about doing that. Don't do that either.  Side note, Pike are fantastic in Tomato sauce for pasta, there's nothing wrong with keeping a fish for the table."
909167,BillM,2015-04-10 00:10:00,17367,I always grab a pike by squeezing the gill plates (Big/small doesn't matter).  Not to sure how that's going to break it's back.   Best part is that it usually immobilizes them enough to pop the hooks and get them back in the water.
909174,Raf,2015-04-10 01:01:00,3495,that's a little harder to do with a 20lb - 40+ incher bill. once they get that big they go in the muskie net.
909178,Salmonidstalker,2015-04-10 01:06:00,265,"I could see how pinching gill plates could do damage to the spinal cord of a fish.  All its weight vertically suspended, kicking back and forth.  And damages the gill raker as well.  Old IM makes a good point."
908543,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-07 13:09:00,937, I couldn't see the video but if your not using long nosed pliers you should get a set. Best thing in the world for keeping your hands away from the teeth and hooks.  A good set of hook cutters is must also if you get into big fish and can't get the hooks out.   I'm hoping to purchase them the next time I'm near a hardware store.

908564,Gallie,2015-04-07 15:34:00,1215,If i ever get to a point where i can catch muskie on a regular basis i may start debarbing those as well.  Maybe a day out with fisherpete will help that ?

Geez I shutter when I think about catching northerns as a child. Floppin all over the boat because I was too scared to handle them better. Now its a non issue.  He is a tip that was passed on to me along time ago.  Grab a pair of sawfiling gloves. Once you learn how to grab a pike, youll be laughing at how easy it is and you wont need gloves and youll be confident enough to grab any pike straight outta the water.  And grab em on slack line. If they feel that tension thats when they wanna go nutso.  Nice fish and never mind the bashing. Some people here have never EVER mishandled a fish???"

908570,lew,2015-04-07 16:15:00,12766,"  Gloves will help me out a lot.   Gloves will help you hold a slimey pike but if by chance a hook goes through the glove and into your hand you'll have a real problem, cause before you can get at the hook you 1st have to get the glove out of the way while an angry fish is shaking on the other end of the hook.  Just something else to keep in mind and the reason for the hook cutters.  Lots to think about with fish with teeth LOL"
908572,manitoubass2,2015-04-07 16:22:00,11391,"No teeth or hook is going through sawfiling gloves lew.  Thats why i suggested it until he get comfy.  Yes though, always have proper pliers and good hook cutters just in case"
908575,lew,2015-04-07 16:27:00,12766,"No teeth or hook is going through sawfiling gloves lew.   Yup, I understand that, I was  talking more about the rubber gloves that so many guys use.  Maybe I should type what I'm thinking LOL"
908578,manitoubass2,2015-04-07 16:35:00,11391,"Oh yeah lew, rubber or even worse leather. Your asking for a disaster if your not very experienced.  Also, at pump knows.  Practice on small fish if possible. As soon as you grab the pike, get it horizontal with your free hand supporting the belly. They thrash alot less, and hurt the fish less. Also if it does flop free, gravity is more on your side then if the fish is vertical.  Look at proper grabbing techniques. The gill plate is a no no imo. Its just as sharp as the teeth lol.  Get your hand inside as close to the mouth as possible. With confidence and a firm hold. Firm enough that if the fish flops you wont drop it, but not with jazz hands where it shakes abit and you drop it lol.  Yes your fingers will be in its mouth, but it cannot bite you in this position"
908579,Roy,2015-04-07 16:36:00,13728,"Just a heads up on gloves. Most protective gloves guard against cuts. They do not protect your hands from hook penetration. You probably won't be able to cut the glove off yourself and in many cases, the walk in clinic you go to may not be equipped to cut it off either. Keep that in mind when choosing a glove."
908581,JoshS,2015-04-07 16:38:00,729,"Here's a few more tips b/c landing and releasing them safely over the breakwalls isn't easy: Climb down a ladder if you can and unhook in the water or if you need a pic, walk the fish over to a low point and grab it. Try to avoid the net and definitely the ground. I use 50lb braid and sling up most of the fish by the line (everything low 30"" and less). Set your rod in your buddy's hand or ground. Grab the line and pull up quickly as possible and grab the leader. Once you have the leader, grab your fish quick, unhook, and torpedo it back head first. When you sling a fish up by the line, the gills flare open making it easy to get your hand in there quickly (or grab the pike behind the head). Bigger fish need to be revived and I suggest using one of the ladders for this (check ladder for safety first - watch out for rust), or walk the fish in the water to a low point where you can grab it and revive in the water.  I understand these are unconventional methods and a bit risky but I've been doing it for years with little issue. If your gear and terminal tackle are strong, and the fish is hooked well and not huge, you're safe.  I love reading fishing posts but I also think everyone should be selective with the spots they post online, especially the ones so close to millions of people.  Goodluck out there!"
908583,manitoubass2,2015-04-07 16:42:00,11391,"Here is a walleye pic. Yes I am wearing mechanic gloves with the index finger cut off because it was just at the end of winter.  You can see those teeth, and my fingers are right beside them. The fish cannot bite you in this position.  "
908584,manitoubass2,2015-04-07 16:44:00,11391,"Yep good info roy, again though thats why i suggest sawfiling gloves to learn. They will not be penetrated by teeth or hook"
908606,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-07 17:44:00,8243,"It's no wonder there are more NF reports here than fishing reports. The kid is new and he gets blasted for mishandling the fish and talking too much time to take a picture. Going back to when I caught my first pike when Sir John A. was Prime Minister we used to club them on the noggin. They actually sold the Billy Club at CTC. Down in the states I've seen guys shoot them with a handgun, the same went for Musky. I met one old timer back in the 70's that shot a Musky while it was laying on the bottom of an aluminum tinny. You can guess what the result of that was. Things have changed for the better, but don't tell me that anyone that caught their first toothy critter handled it like a pro. I do agree that it is not necessary to take a pic of every fish you catch, we never took pictures unless they were all on a stringer. for many reasons. But I actually read somewhere on a forum, if there isn't a picture it was never caught. Bull.  Pump, you just go and keep fishing and reporting back with your catches here. Experience is a lifetime of mistakes, wisdom is not repeating them. I remember reading something some where, "" He who is without sin may he cast the first stone.""  By the way Pump, Pike can't get pregnant, that made me smile.  Johnny D"

908516,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-07 04:59:00,8243,"We go exclusively for Pike on a small lake every 2 years in upper NY state. The early season go to lure there is a Husk Jerk with a burnt orange upper body. Rappala used to make a Husky Jerk floating lure, that was deadly. Jerk, wait, jerk, wait the jerk until it rose to the surface and bam, fish on. I love to use a top water in the shallow bays where they sit and rest post spawn. They are tired after spawning so slow and slower is the key for me. As soon as the water gets warmer go deeper for the big Mamas. Red has always been a go to colour for Northerns this time of year. Slow retrieve an old school Red Daredevil."
908526,Gallie,2015-04-07 12:13:00,1215,"I just watched the last video and it wasnt the prettiest c&r but at least it went back. It does help when you can get them back asap with as little stress as possible, but it takes practice to be good at handling a toothy gator. Having the right tools like spreaders and long needlenose pliers and even boltcutters when necessary can save a lot of fish. I cant say the first few pike i handled were done to perfection but after 20 years im getting the hang of it."
908529,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-07 12:24:00,937,"Thank you Pikeslayer.  I always try my best when handling fish.  Sometimes I take a little longer when trying to get the fish unhooked but I always make sure the fish kick out and swim away unharmed.  This is my first time targeting pike and to be honest, I'm afraid of its teeth and having to unhook all the trebles.  I also don't try and attempt to hold a pike because I know one thrash the fish will drop on the floor.  As you can see in the last vid, I was hustling to get the fish unhooked and to get it back in the water.  Theirs always room for improvement."

You exhaust it, let it flop on the bank until it stays still enough for a picture, and a terrible picture at that.  Whats so great about a fish lying on the ground covered in mud and grass?  A real wall framer right there!  All of its protective slime comes off, its completely stressed and the chances of it dying after release becomes higher.  Just because it swims away doesn't mean it lives.  Gotta get pics to post it on facebook, instagram, twitter, text etc.  Why don't you net the fish and keep it in the water while unhooking it.  Get your buddy to have his camera ready, two three quick shots and then back it goes???"
908537,PUMP KNOWS,2015-04-07 12:59:00,937,"The pike choked on the lure and I had to unhook it behind its gills.  If you watch the video @4:20, you can hear me say ""We don't need a picture"".  I know it's pregnant and it rolled around in the grass... Yes I was concerned and if you listen I wanted to rush and get it back in the water.  I made a bad call and waited for the pictures to be taken....it's my bad."
908539,chris.brock,2015-04-07 13:02:00,4053,"The NF stuff is fun, but I like fish pics/ reports.  If guys keep getting flack they get ticked off and don't post. This is a fishing forum after all.  Keep calm and chive on!  oh yeah, good thread and nice pikes!"
908542,AKRISONER,2015-04-07 13:09:00,5558,"ding ding here comes the catch and release police.  Pump I would suggest doing a bit of reading on how to properly handle pike, specifically a gill plate hold. Theres plenty online about how to pick the fish up without sticking your hands into the gills, but at the same time avoid their teeth. Practice makes perfect!  As mentioned here a pair of 10 dollar handheld bolt cutters would be a great thing to have especially since you are targeting Ice out pike, which generally are big females. Also never leave home without a pair of long pliers, pike are really aggressive and swallow trebles a lot.  Nice catch though!"
682589,Djeep,2012-04-01 16:17:00,199,"So with the prespawn pike season coming to a close in most areas, I was wondering how the OFC members made out this year with the unusual weather. In years past, spring pike reports were plentiful so I know theres some gator hunters out there.  Heres the biggest I got, from lake ontario. Lets see your catches! I didnt get a 40"" like i was hoping haha hopefully someone else did!    Heres a video I made of the trip with the GoPro, most of you will recognize the area!    Post up your spring pike"
682594,BillM,2012-04-01 16:38:00,17367,Still waiting for the pike opener.
682666,mikeseb,2012-04-01 19:30:00,201,went out for pike twice in march and was skunked both times lol
682677,Joeytier,2012-04-01 20:04:00,3990,"Pike fishing has been great for me over the past 2 weeks or so.  A little over 20 fish in about 10 trips.  No 40"" for me either, but most in the 28 - 32 "" range and a small handful larger.  The clackin minnows have been deadly, especially when the water muddies up...   One of the nicer fish...    Many days, especially the colder windier days, a big sucker under a float is about the only thing that will produce.  Double check on the MNR website that your favourite spots are indeed zone 20.  A few spots I fish are actually in zone 17 and remain open."
682684,Dave Bailey,2012-04-01 20:15:00,1641,"Nice ones. Nothing for me yet this year, but I was only out twice.   Yeah, just about anything north and east of Frenchman's Bay is Zone 17. FB itself is Zone 20, so until May 5th it's nothing for me without a drive."
682685,googie,2012-04-01 20:18:00,23,Hey Guys congrats on your Pike fishing! Thanks for sharing .
682734,GoneFishin,2012-04-01 21:50:00,349,"Here's a skinny one from frenchman's yesterday, got out before the season closed. It didn't fight hard but took 2 us us to get the thing to open it's damn mouth! Jaw spreaders will be my next purchase.  "
682740,Djeep,2012-04-01 22:13:00,199,Nice fish guys!  Wrap the ends of the jaw spreaders with tape or some sort of pad so theyre not as sharp in the pikes mouth. I have seen them go right through unfortunately.
682743,Gregoire,2012-04-01 22:24:00,1397,I'm seriously jealous of these reports. I only got out twice and never to my hotspots and I missed that really warm window. Nothing but lure washing for me. Hopefully when the season opens up again there are still some big girls hanging out in the shallows.
682755,JCRG,2012-04-01 22:56:00,57,Nice fat pike. This was my first year targeting pre-spawn pike. Got out twice on lake Ontario and got skunked. Fished a smaller inland lake one time and managed 3 pike in one afternoon but nothing picture worthy.
682785,boombap,2012-04-02 00:17:00,310,Made it out twice and landed 1 fish.. total of about 4 hours.
682802,houski,2012-04-02 01:26:00,61,"I've been out to Balsam a few times. Here's my best so far this spring. A 33"", not big, but not bad for the Kawartha's."
682814,northernpike56,2012-04-02 02:28:00,717,"my biggest (and only) pike was a 21""er. woo-hoo?"
682933,Djeep,2012-04-02 15:51:00,199,nice kawarthas pike for sure. Ive tried there once with no success.
682935,Harrison,2012-04-02 15:59:00,2202,Just getting dailed in on Lake Ontario shorelines and bays for Pike with the umbrella rig and it closed Mar 31..... or so I thought.  Just had a hard look at the map boundry details between FMZ 20 and FMZ 17 Pike open year round.
682937,Djeep,2012-04-02 16:03:00,199,Are you saying Lake O shorelines fall under FMZ 17 regulations? I did not think this was the case but I have been wrong before.
682949,Garfisher,2012-04-02 16:53:00,229,Lake O shorelines DO fall under FMZ 20 because you are still fishing Lake Ontario (however rivers aren't unless specified on the boundary map for FMZ 20)
682959,Harrison,2012-04-02 17:32:00,2202," No sir, the shorelines are not open.  However, in some of the areas I fish east and west of me the 20 boundry does not follow in shore the same as it does in other areas."
682976,Djeep,2012-04-02 19:08:00,199,thanks for the clarification fellas!
682994,trophypikehunter,2012-04-02 21:00:00,89,Lake Ontario Last Week! 
683269,houski,2012-04-03 14:55:00,61,Those Lake O fish sure are nice looking! Very distinct patterning.
683325,Lungelarry,2012-04-03 19:01:00,294,"OFNer, FIL with a nice Francis 38F pike. "
683420,Moosebunk,2012-04-03 23:46:00,3970,"Cool to see some softwater pike ""closure"" fish."
908393,jameshandz,2015-04-06 19:58:00,31,"hey everyone , been trying to land a pike for some time  now. I have only ever had one on and it was a fluke. the thing hit a wakey set up and with no leader easily broke the line. I have had some follow(4) down in the harbors(whitby / osh) but nothing ever took . just wondering what they are going after in the spring time . I think i have tried everything. and when i say try i mean like 8 hours in a day straight then again the next day . Im not looking for honey holes or anything like that maybe just what time of day may be better? any help would be great . Another few weeks till i can hit the trailer in the kawarthas and start pulling in bass. thanks guys"
908396,AKRISONER,2015-04-06 20:09:00,5558,"everything is closed now, come opener in may, look for pike in the shallows trying to warm up. Science says pike will do anything to stay in the 18 degree celcius zone, meaning the later in the summer the deeper the big ones go. at that time find deeper weed beds and toss spoons. Pike will basically hit anything that moves, its just a matter of finding them."
