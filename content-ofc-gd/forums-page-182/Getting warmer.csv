909732,BillM,2015-04-12 23:27:00,17367,Nice!  Would like to see some 43-46 degree water temps before I haul the boat down there.
909742,spincast,2015-04-12 23:44:00,3279,"A week of warm nights, a little more rain and next weekend we should there Bill. Got my fingers crossed the winds don't make a mess of it this week."

Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for as well.  Next weekend I'm good, boat is rigged and ready I'm just keeping my eye on those water temps!"
909775,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-13 02:12:00,8243,Hopefully this week. Quite a few boats along Ontario today says my brother who is in Dalhousie.
909793,pics,2015-04-13 05:30:00,1268,Watched a few boats come in from the lake on Hamilton harbour late this afternoon. Yesterday someone in a canoe didn't think he could make it back to Bayfront park so he proceeded to come ashore and portage across the plant. Wasn't long before security nabbed him and escorted him out. He was lucky to avoid charges.. kind of foolhardy to be canoeing on big water that had ice floating around last week...
909795,wormdunker,2015-04-13 07:36:00,1711,Nice brown!  Bring on the warm weather.  I've had enough winter!
