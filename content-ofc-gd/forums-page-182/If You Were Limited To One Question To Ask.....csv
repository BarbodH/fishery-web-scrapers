909736,brw,2015-04-12 23:39:00,101,"If you had one question to ask a fellow walleye angler coming off a successful day on the lake (and assuming he/she was willing to answer), what would it be? Mine would be: :""At what depth were you catching your fish?"" More than water temp, lure, lure color, etc, this one would be most valuable to me. Interested in others thoughts on this topic.  Cheers.  "
909740,ccmtcanada,2015-04-12 23:43:00,7971,Can you give me GPS coordinates??  Depth as well if they don't answer.  Lol
909743,Bernie,2015-04-12 23:47:00,3190,Always depth when it comes to the walleye.
909753,Acountdeleted,2015-04-13 00:13:00,2562,Why wern't you targeting bass instead?  
909774,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-13 02:07:00,8243,"Can I have one for the pan please? To be serious here on Erie finding the depth suspending fish are is the easy part. They school in large numbers. Here I would ask what speed were you trolling at.  Can we get a follow up question? Bait colour. There are days that one colour of the same body bait or harness will out fish other identical bait profiles by 100%. I had one Reef Runner with a purple back bring every fish in the boat, as soon as the thing was set bam, fish on, even before reaching the strike zone. I mean they were talking it to the first treble. We had 9 Reef Runners on between our 2 boats, that purple was the ticket. The next day anything with a perch pattern, next day it's Fire Tiger and only Fire Tiger. And I was told by an experienced fisherman fish are colour blind, not these ones. So I need 2 questions answered, both as equally important. One goes with the other for the fishing we do here."
909776,Raf,2015-04-13 02:16:00,3495,any muskie eat your bait?
909792,mike rousseau,2015-04-13 04:49:00,4661,On my home water... What type of structure were you catching on?  Any other water I'd ask What was your program or pattern? That covers everything...lol
909800,Big Cliff,2015-04-13 09:00:00,6899,Would you like a cold one?
909804,NANUK,2015-04-13 10:34:00,797,What time is dinner ?
909828,netminder,2015-04-13 14:37:00,514,"I think depth is most critical. I find it a lot easier to figure where they should be, but just figuring out where the right ""should be"" is usually comes down to figuring out proper depth.  Either that or just pull out a map and say, ""Where?"" lol"
909838,206,2015-04-13 15:45:00,563,Any luck?  If they are on they are on if they aren't you know it'll be a slower day lol
909840,Acountdeleted,2015-04-13 15:58:00,2562,On my home lake I ask how many they kept. I know where to catch em. Just wanna make sure no one is keeping over their limit.
909843,manitoubass2,2015-04-13 16:04:00,11391,How was your day on the water?  Id prefer to be driendly and hope they had fun.  Ill figure out the rest(I really enjoy that aspect)
909866,Handlebarz,2015-04-13 17:42:00,3790,Same as Raf any musky eating your bait fish?
909875,EC1,2015-04-13 18:38:00,930,"""What's your pattern?"" You'll very quickly realise that the better fishermen know way more details than others. This also offers you the most opportunity to learn for yourself, and finding areas for yourself.  But of course, take words from other fishermen with a grain of salt. I don't think many people will be willing to share all these details with some random person at the launch. Also, the definition of ""a good day fishing"" varies tremendously from person to person."
909879,Acountdeleted,2015-04-13 18:40:00,2562,If I get 1 it's a good day fishing.
909890,Headhunter,2015-04-13 19:03:00,5703,Are you going to be using those eye balls? I need some perch bait. HH
