As I stepped out the thunder started to roll and the rain began diluting my coffee. I decided against standing out on the lake in a thunder storm, put my fishing gear back in the house and headed out to take a few pics to show the wife and kid who were still sound asleep.  Did not get to fish but watching the sun come up more than compensated.                                                       "
