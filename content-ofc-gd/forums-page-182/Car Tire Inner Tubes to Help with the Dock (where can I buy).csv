907159,ketchenany,2015-03-31 01:13:00,3229,"This  worked out well! I got rid of my pails  I get to meet another OFNer. Sinker will be happy.  hey Cliff if Paul has room I have a weedeater that I had problems and we often tried to 'fix'  (lack of parts) with and if you can use it and fix it, it's yours. I don't believe in landfill.  Do you want it?  A"
907192,Big Cliff,2015-03-31 08:59:00,6899,"Sure, I don't believe in land fill either."
908735,ketchenany,2015-04-08 02:17:00,3229,"Sinker, the pails have begun their journey to you, about 12 (21 L)  and so has the weed thing for Cliff. It will be better off tha ina landfill. Hope for a good journey, Paul will insure that part. Paul (manjo39) it was a pleasure chatting with you. We have common family values by the looks of it. Sora lives on lol. Send me an email and I'll give you a lot more info on the family place in Pottageville."
909058,Sinker,2015-04-09 17:19:00,8692,"Good stuff Fella's! This has worked out great!  Thanks for the pails Albert, I'll put them to good use!  S."

909066,Big Cliff,2015-04-09 17:30:00,6899,LOVE IT!!!!!

909374,Regan Thompson,2015-04-11 12:17:00,80,"Not sure where, but for my old docks I bought a couple of dock floats from home depot.  The each year I would just slip one under each end of dock section and move them out that way.  I'd even get my boat lift out the same way."

The each year I would just slip one under each end of dock section and move them out that way.  I'd even get my boat lift out the same way. That might be a really good way to do it; just float them in and out then adjust the legs for stability. I'll have to check them out!"
906289,manjo39,2015-03-27 13:27:00,354,"Hi All, does anyone know where I can get car tire sized inner tubes to help float my dock for easier installation/removal. Or if anyone has any other ideas to help float the dock in/out? I'm located in Vaughan or Lindsay."
906290,lookinforwalleye,2015-03-27 13:29:00,4399,Maybe try the TSC stores..
906291,Terry,2015-03-27 13:37:00,14456,Sealed 5gal 20 litre buckets used.
906293,Big Cliff,2015-03-27 13:39:00,6899,"Lets talk! I am going to be looking at the same sort of thing. I'll check with Particks Tire here in the next few days, he might have some used ones that we can get for the cost of a patch."

I'll check with Particks Tire here in the next few days, he might have some used ones that we can get for the cost of a patch.  Thanks Cliff, that's great!  I've been calling around to some tire places here who sell used tires and no one has had any for quite some time."
906308,manjo39,2015-03-27 14:32:00,354,"Sealed 5gal 20 litre buckets used.  Thanks Terry, I have some 5GAL plastic buckets with lids.  But the lids are not tightly sealed.  How to you get a seal on the lid?"
906314,Old Man,2015-03-27 14:58:00,822,Try tire dealers that service agricultural equipment. Many field impliments still use tube tires.
906315,Big Cliff,2015-03-27 14:59:00,6899,"Paul, don't give it a second thought, I need something for me, and you can use mine NO PROBLEM!  Tubes work well because they are easy to store when you don't need them. I am also building a dock leveling device so that once your dock is in, you can just sit on the dock and adjust it to wherever you need then tighten the bolts. Super for compensating for poles that settle into the bottom after everything is installed."
906317,Freshtrax,2015-03-27 15:01:00,2215,"Tsc, should have implement tire tubes."
906333,manjo39,2015-03-27 15:33:00,354,"Thanks All.  Found them!  Cliff, I called Patrick's and they said they do have a few.  I'll call you to coordinate.  If Patrick's doesn't work out for any reason, I called TSC and they have them!  $8.50 ea."
906345,kickingfrog,2015-03-27 16:22:00,8333,Do they even make inner tubes for car tires?
906346,kickingfrog,2015-03-27 16:23:00,8333,... Anymore?
906454,ketchenany,2015-03-27 22:48:00,3229,How many do you need? I may be able to help you out. I have the wine pails.
906460,Terry,2015-03-27 23:05:00,14456," Thanks Terry, I have some 5GAL plastic buckets with lids.  But the lids are not tightly sealed.  How to you get a seal on the lid? the ones I used had a rubber ring to seal them, but put a bead of silicone around the rim and stick the lid on, on my buddy's dock they fit well between the boards"
906487,Sinker,2015-03-28 00:06:00,8692,If you need to get rid of wine pails let me know. Thats what I collect my sap in for maple syrup. Can never have enough.
906490,Sinker,2015-03-28 00:08:00,8692,"Btw, Cliff and Manjo, I have an old styrofoam buoy, about 2ft diamete, maybe 3ft long that would probably work great for what you need to do. Its yours if you want it. If the timing is right I might even be able to deliver and help put the docks in. Pm if interested. I can s2nd a pic.  S."

906559,ketchenany,2015-03-28 14:33:00,3229,I just checked and in my shed I have at least 12 you can have most with spill proof Lids  and I have another dozen in the garage with lids. I do like to keep a few but you are welcome ro have them. How do I get them to you? That is the question?
906560,ketchenany,2015-03-28 14:34:00,3229,Sorry sinker see above post replied ro the wrong one
906565,manjo39,2015-03-28 14:42:00,354,"Ketchanany, I can pick them up and bring them up to Lindsay for Sinker if that works out for both of you."
906569,Big Cliff,2015-03-28 14:50:00,6899,"OK, and I just PMd Sinker and am in the process of aranging to get the float he had, sounds like it is exactly what we need! so this sounds like it is working out perfectly for everyone."
906585,ketchenany,2015-03-28 15:37:00,3229,I have them here so if Sinker wants them you can come by and pick them up. Justvlet me know ahead of time so I can bring them to the garage ans sort out the lids.  I'm close to Rutherford and Islington.
906649,Sinker,2015-03-28 19:26:00,8692,"Well, this is working out swell!! Thanks boys! I've made arrangements with Cliff to get him the float. Hopefully I can be available to help with the docks, but I say that every year, and it never works out with my work schedule. Maybe this will be the year.....  Ketchenany, Pm me your address and I'll send you some of my syrup!  S."
906678,ketchenany,2015-03-28 21:45:00,3229,"Sinker, the pails are yours? there is no need for syrup but it would be good to try instead of the store- bought. The other member from Woodbridge offered to deliver, I'm open to that. Anytime, better than the landfill.  I think I can get you about 15+ with lids . . . .I do keep some for myself  Is it too late for this year?  I may have another vessel for you for storage 54 L glass thingy used for wine also.  PM me if you want.   PM me and"
