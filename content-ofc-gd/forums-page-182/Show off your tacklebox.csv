903773,manitoubass2,2015-03-15 18:33:00,11391,The one in your hand is a deadly walleye bait
904223,PikeMolester,2015-03-17 21:55:00,428,Good. Can't wait to use them.  I love JDM tackle. So much finesse stuff that transfers over well for clear lake smallies. I have always used Rapala and Spro but interested in taking a step up. Took the plunge and got some Jackall hardbaits. 17$-21$ a piece. I haven't used any mega bass or lucky crafts to compare but I love Jackall. 
909928,PikeMolester,2015-04-13 23:04:00,428,"Moved up in the lure world. 20$ per crank is now standard. Paid 35$ for some Megabass ones from Japan...Lucky Craft, Jackall and Megabass. Obsessed with finesse JDM stuff and JDM only patterns now.      "

Ordered from Japan came to over 30$ a piece but still arrive faster than if I ordered something from Basspro or Cabelas...

902825,PikeMolester,2015-03-11 07:34:00,428,2015 is here
902828,Old Ironmaker,2015-03-11 10:07:00,8243,"Yes it's 2015, even though this thread is 5 years old a thread like this never gets old.  I love sneaking a peek at another persons box. That just doesn't sound right. I know some anglers that would rather let you look at their wife naked than look at their tackle. Seriously A friend of mine is like that. Some can't wait to show you. A fishing pal I have, Groundy, has rooms full of tackle. I think he had to ask a live in Gal he had once to move out because her stuff was taking up valuable tackle space. This great outdoorsman has more ""stuff"" that is fishing related then some fairly well stocked bait shops, for sure more.  I have too much myself to get on a disc. At least I wished I did. Good reminder to take pictures for insurance purposes. My 6 or 7 boxes of minnow baits for Lake Erie Eyes has to be worth a grand at least.  While on the subject of tackle boxes I am looking for the box a guy I fished with from another forum last year on Erie had.His profile isn't on there anymore, I hope he is OK if you know what I mean. The box is a hard box that the top opens, it has hard plastic what I will call pages in them that flip side to side. The hooks of the tackle is hung on small opennings on the tops of the pages and as I said you can flip the pages like you would in a filing cabinet. No way hooks can get tangled up and the baits are easy to see. I know they sell them at a shop in Woodstock but have not seen any online. Anyone know what the hey I'm talking about? I've never seen one like this in the 35 years I've been fishing. Thank you if you can help me find one. I know they can't be cheap, but it would save me hauling a half a dozen or more trays of minnow baits in the boat.  As far as posting pics of my boxes, no you can't look, especially the boxes of my antique plugs and spoons. I don't need any looky loos putting athe gleep on them when I'm not home. Hey I was raised and lived in Hamilton for 45 years, I don't trust anyone.  What is also cool reading an old thread is the many names I recognize and the many I don't."

902863,PUMP KNOWS,2015-03-11 14:12:00,937,Awesome thread!  I hope to post mine in the near future.

902932,PikeMolester,2015-03-11 22:04:00,428,"It has been 5 years since we started this thread and I was naively first building a base to my tackle as it was already an obsession. A few years later, I have so much stuff now, stuff I don't even bring out with me or even will ever use. I don't have my own boat or much storage so I skim my tackle down to what has produced best for me here on the St-Lawrence. I fish primarily for smallmouth, occasionally largemouth and sometimes troll for walleye. I'm about to go back to Eagle Lake Island Lodge on Eagle Lake in sunset country. I am from Montreal but will be there in charge of the lodge's dock operations for the season. I have to cram everything to fly it there with me and this is some of what made the cut, my go tos, new and untested from Mystery Tackle Box or Tackle Grab or proven producers for me. Very cluttered.     "
902934,PikeMolester,2015-03-11 22:09:00,428,These are always rigged and thrown into a plano.  
902937,PikeMolester,2015-03-11 22:12:00,428,    These have been the absolute smallmouth killers.   
902940,PikeMolester,2015-03-11 22:28:00,428,"Way too many plastics. This is the half I use and will bring with me. I drop shot for smallies 80% of the time. These are proven on the St-Lawrence.  Hands down the best drop shot plastics for me have been the Reins Bubble Shaker, Jackall Crosstail Shad, Jackall Super Pin Tail and the Yamamoto Shad Shape Worm. I don't need anything else. They get bites when nothing else did so I just started using only those. They are all very flimsy and usually cost you a lure per hookup. Quite expensive for the Reins and Jackall but I can't argue that they produce very well.    These Gamakatsu drop shot hooks are amazing. Come to 2.25$ a hook but the weight has 2 points to snap off if it snags and I lose a lot less setups. I think I lost only 1 or 2 all season. "
902942,lew,2015-03-11 22:30:00,12766,"5 baits is all you need, anything else just wastes space  "
902946,PikeMolester,2015-03-11 22:42:00,428,"Lost a box with $400+ of spinnerbaits last season. I started leaning towards chatterbaits and bladebaits. These are always ready to go.  These Bluefox spinners catch fish more than any other spinnerbait I've ever used, big smallies too. Picked these up yesterday. Sebile Vibrato. 14$ each. Jigging spoon fall smallies  Power Bait finesse worms and YUM green pumpking with Chartreuse tails are key. Zman and Strike king are from Mystery Tackle box and tackle Grab this winter. Using these VMC half moons to swim clear smoke grubs over lethargic suspending smallies might be the best thing I've ever done. Never thought I could catch those guys."

It never ends !!!! And 64 fishing rods and at least 70reels !!  Not to mention all my tackle components for making flies and worm harnesses !! Basically a tackle store would be about right !!!! A lifelong addiction 40yrs worth ... Still going too !!! Oh ya about 10more planos filled with plastics and bags and bags of senkos and slammers !!!  That's just the tip of the iceberg !!!! Hahahah

Figure out what YOU really like and what works for YOU.... The sell sell sell....  I've purged a lot if gear this year... And I still have a ton of gear that hardy ever sees use...
807127,Squid,2013-09-10 18:34:00,1656,"Too bad you can't re-tool yourself cause that is where the problem lies not with the equipment. I have all that I need to catch me some fish of any species. I have been told that you may need that ""special"" color to catch a fish but the problem is that the sport is called fishing and not catching.  I spent 6 hrs in 3.5 foot waves casting musky baits on LSC last Thursday and managed to bring 5 fish to the boat. The cold front that day closed their yaps so tight that they just floated there and stared at the baits. I did not think that I needed another 20 spinners to ensure that I catch a fish.What I was truly thinking was man I need a taser to stun them!!  I watched an epsisode of Musky hunter up in LOTW. The lodge owner brought two baits with him to fish muskies with Saric. He outfished Saric who had a slew of different baits to toss and the owner was  kind of a matter of fact when asked why just the two baits."

566940,PikeMolester,2011-03-28 20:05:00,428,"send me your garbage that you ""pitched"" lol"
567047,bucktail,2011-03-29 00:28:00,1857,I may have a problem  http://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/198979_10150439232200691_631935690_17983511_3521765_n.jpg
567053,GBW,2011-03-29 00:32:00,8460,"I don't see a problem, just organize..."
567057,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-29 00:38:00,1107, Trust me I don't throw it away until it's garbage most was old plastics and trashed spinner baits (I do alot of pike fishing) and bags of plastics that only have 1-2 baits left in it .  Bucktail we want to see what's in the tackle boxes not just the boxes
567212,ehg,2011-03-29 13:14:00,2666,"Just wondering if any of this tackle caught fish last year. It is almost a year later. What worked the best?  I have some lures i bought 10 yrs. ago i still haven't used. Soft plastics seem to pile up as well.  This spring just bought marabou crappie jigs, thats it."
567383,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-29 23:30:00,1107, The spinnerbaits all caught fish and the wake baits are awesome caught bass and pike on them the swim baits I didn't give them a real good go yet but they will get used more this year.Oh and both frogs were thrashed from lots of bass and a few pike and I have bought more since.
567400,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-03-30 00:25:00,1107,Picked these up on the weekend can't wait to try these for pike and buckets BB just for size .  
567454,ehg,2011-03-30 02:35:00,2666,"Yup, spinnerbaits are real productive, wake baits and topwaters have their time too.  Similarily i have a few swimbaits that look great but i have no confidence in them.  This year i will try more to use them.  Cheers!"
567459,GBW,2011-03-30 02:41:00,8460,I read something recently about a chatter bait like that for walleye/pickeral/pickerleye as well.  I might have to find mine then if they work on a slow day...
567460,ctranter,2011-03-30 02:42:00,543,LOL and I thought I had tackle addiction issues.  I have a lot of catching up to do!
567480,dhickey,2011-03-30 05:58:00,1038,its quality not quantity..  so ive herd..?    ps. help with posting pitures welcome. i have a couple of peices i would like to get some feedback on. fathers collection.
553058,PikeMolester,2011-02-18 18:58:00,428,"Highly detailed as I expected. Made for the angler no doubt. All you need is a white belly anyways, however Dave Mercer did catch giant bullfrogs on it. ahahhaa I still like the SPRO JR in white for 3$ less.    I really like the added arms  2 sizes  River2Sea and Koppers in the middle "
553063,MCTFisher9120,2011-02-18 19:16:00,3761,Are the frogs nice and soft comparable to the Snag Proof's?
553064,PikeMolester,2011-02-18 19:25:00,428,"I've only been fishing for 2 seasons and only owned SPRO,River2Sea and now Koppers frogs. They are all equally collapsible in my opinion. Koppers are more soft to the touch however."
553083,Handlebarz,2011-02-18 20:50:00,3790,here is one that i use in the fall.  
553087,manitoubass2,2011-02-18 20:54:00,11391,"out of all the frogs i've used, i prefer spro. but i will be grabbing some of these live target frogs this spring for sure.  worst frog i've ever used in this style was a matzuo frog, so stiff and akward on the retrieve"
553089,archie_james_c,2011-02-18 20:58:00,618,Heres my winter buildup. Alot of the crankbaits in the pic I had last year. I gotta get my a$$ in gear and build more crawler harnesses..im only down to 10 or so

554299,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-22 11:05:00,1107,Their called paycheck lures and its a punch skirt hope ya find them easier than I did.
554346,Governator,2011-02-22 14:30:00,879,I just love going through this thread.  Do any of you buy insurance for fishing tackle?  Some of you guys have so much $ invested I would assume you could protect yourself (I'm not there yet)
554385,PikeMolester,2011-02-22 16:37:00,428,Ah it is a Paycheck. k thanks.
554765,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-23 19:53:00,1107,  Thats why most of these guys have all the pics of their tackle for insurance purposes I catalog mine every year and give my broker a copy of the list with pictures I didn't do it last year but will be this year for sure I had a house fire and lost about $2500 in gear ins adjuster said I was lying LOL I prolly have $7000 worth now + the boat so he would laugh in my face they want to give you the least amount of money as possible so the better you protect yourself the better off you will be if something terrible ever happens unfortunately I found out the hard way
554770,Governator,2011-02-23 20:00:00,879,"  That's what I thought, too bad on the house fire sorry to hear.  I have maybe 4 or 5 rods and 5 full plano boxes but that's about it.  Well plus ice fishing gear too.  Come to think of it I probably have $1200-$1500 worth and I only started in 08.  I could see the $$ going up pretty steadily."
554776,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-02-23 20:18:00,1107, Fire was in 2003 so it's been awhile most wounds have healed .you are definately getting up there I would take pics of all your gear atleast so you don't have to fight with them .Now back to the tackle LOL

545228,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-29 21:38:00,1107,Picked up a few things to add to my stash .  
545232,MCTFisher9120,2011-01-29 21:50:00,3761,Nice stuff SRT. Haven't bought anything for a little while now
545234,Leecher,2011-01-29 22:01:00,7832, SRT8 great stash but for the spinnerbaits.... go to www.Luremaking.com and order kits like this    and you'll make great lures and cut down on your $$$    I know I ain't buying another spinnerbait from any sports store cause it cost around $3.89 a piece to make Leechman
545241,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-29 22:13:00,1107, I would love to Leech but with a 2 year old and working 50 hours a week I just don't have the time I have a hard time getting on here half the time .I will be getting some stuff to make heavy flouro leaders though .
545245,Leecher,2011-01-29 22:22:00,7832, They don't take much time to put together (maybe 5 minutes tops) you'd be surprised trust me I know     but the painting is a little longer but not that much longer  I still think you should give it a try Leechman
545249,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-29 22:27:00,1107, I will have a look when I order the other stuff I like the chart/orange skirts you got that color is amazing for pike on Longpoint bay
545267,Leecher,2011-01-29 23:04:00,7832," Thanks SRT8!!!  The chartreuse/orange & white/pink I put some thinking into it and came up with a couple of colors that I think would entice the critters.... it sure is sweet to see the results  Here's what I ordered and hope that it can lead you into your first order  1/4oz Ultra heads unpainted Molded 3D eyes 5/32"" glow/black 5"" Silicon Skirts white/hot pink tip & chartreuse/orange tip Fluorescent 3D acrylic beads pink & yellow #4 Crane swivel nickel color #7 Split rings - bright stainless steel #3 Stirrup clevices nickel color #3 Colorado blades - Steel hammered nickel #3 Willowleaf blades - Steel hammered nickel #3 1/2  Give it a go....

545295,archer379,2011-01-29 23:57:00,277, i got some of there prepainted kits for christmas after seeing one of your earlier posts they are really simple and save you a ton of coin
545296,Leecher,2011-01-30 00:01:00,7832, They sure do archer
545791,canon,2011-01-31 14:00:00,36," Cool! Really NICE pics.  btw, did the lure on this pic working good? I have this lure too but never catch a fish and wonder whether I need cut the joint first before using it?"
545926,SRT8 smoker craft,2011-01-31 17:15:00,1107,  Yes thgey work great and you should be cutting the tenticles free from the claws gives a lot more action they are deadly on a nuckle ball jig.
546048,PikeMolester,2011-01-31 21:04:00,428,Yes I love them. Definitely cut all the appendages free. Works best for me on stand up jigs and nuckle balls on the rocks for smallies. Have caught pike while swimming them too
546114,canon,2011-02-01 00:13:00,36,"    Thx guys, great help. will try this in spring and summer."
552403,PikeMolester,2011-02-17 03:21:00,428,Brands picking up Trokar. Posted a spinnerbait with Trokar earlier in this thread and here is a new swim jig with Trokar hook Buck Eye J-Will Trokar Swimjig http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Buckeye_J-Will_Trokar_SwimJig/descpage-BJWTS.html

515097,mercman,2010-10-27 01:11:00,7054,"hey Matt i dont think it really matters if they soak in it,but it must get messy in the boat."
515266,Rattletrap2,2010-10-27 19:06:00,1652, LOL Gord! That's what I'm thinking! It sure would be a shame to get any of that purdy stuff wet by using it!  Just kidding guys! I'm obviously envious of your orderly organization. Mine is a just little.....well.....used looking! ( and a lot uglier!). I probably catch less fish though.
515267,Rattletrap2,2010-10-27 19:10:00,1652," I'm just the opposite. If I catch a Pike, I try to clean it's foul scent off my baits in case it scares the ""real"" fish away.....like BASS! LOL"
515716,PikeMolester,2010-10-28 22:36:00,428,Ya I can't wait to use them...unfortunately it will probably be next season.
518063,MCTFisher9120,2010-11-06 20:45:00,3761,Nice Stuff!
518064,BiggFish,2010-11-06 21:16:00,40," Hey man, where can I get one of those spinner bait cases? I need one badly.  Chad"
518107,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-11-07 00:44:00,1107, Yes gulp is fine in the gulp alive package. They are not a mess in the boat at all you just have to keep the foam seal in the lid or it will leak some guys just cut a hole in the foam and it won't leak for them.
518164,Moosebunk,2010-11-07 07:29:00,3970,I gotta show my wife Skud's pic.  Only then will I become unretarded again. lol.

I have 40 some odd spinnerbaits all jammed in the top of one box with no dividers. Takes a few mins if I want one from the bottom of the cluster fudge!  Nice tackle guys. Go get them clean scratch free lures beat up and dirty !"
466843,Syn,2010-05-15 23:29:00,519,"   That use to be me long ago, but once I found my lures with rusted trebles and then I put the tangled lures down beside me on the boat bench. One lure fell on the boat floor. I bent over to pick it up and because of the rolling waves I ended up sitting on the tangled lure mess and got pinched in the behind.    That's when I started keeping my tackle somewhat organized and hooks sharpened.  I use the humidity absorber packs in my tackle boxes now, the kind you find when you buy electronics, kitchen taps, etc.  After I catch my first fish with a new lure I like to wipe the lure with the fishes mouth just to give it a more natural scent. It actually worked well for me when using spinnerbaits and pike.  When you fish for pike you don't have to worry about not scratching up lures lol."
466877,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-05-16 02:13:00,1107,  Try gulp alive spray or yum LPT spray both work great and I have made a few guys eat their words while I out fish them with scent and there not using it me and my brother fishing the same lure me with scent him without and I caught a few pike he got skunked he was peed he uses it all the time now.
466881,Syn,2010-05-16 02:19:00,519," I hear ya.  I've tried a few fish attractant spays in previous years with pretty good results but they don't stay on the bait for long. I hope the Mega Strike I purchased proves to be awesome this year. Good thing about this stuff is that is not stinky. I can barely smell it, probably because its amino acids.  I still do the fish mouth wipe thing for scent as well as good luck."

514482,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-24 19:22:00,3761,My tackle is soo low right now...fishing for 2 straight months day in and out in the summer takes a beating on tackle.

465636,Syn,2010-05-12 18:11:00,519," Yep once i saw them I had to have a couple.  As you might have guessed I got them from ebay  . seller texperd Jim Greens' custom flies. They were about $5 a fly.  Looking at the design of the flies closely I think they are easy to make. With the supplies I have on hand I think I will make a few of my own. The head is just foam with epoxy. Might be the UV curing kind.  The foam sheets I have are from dollar store and it takes crayola markers well. Epoxy? I'll probably use the devcon 2ton. Ordered some 5/0 circle hooks from ebay. eyes check. Add some flash tied in.  I think I'll try to make them tube fly versions so I can switch hooks easily. I'm tempted to make them into flouro leaders tied through the tube directly to the hook.  Probably make some of these too: http://www.pikeflyro...r-pattern-.html  I still have to make magnum spinner baits, rabbit strip lures, and now pike flouro flies. Wonder if I'll have time to fish this summer? haha   "

465727,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-12 22:17:00,3761,"About the organization critic, I have been out fishing probable 4 or 5 times so far this season and after every trip I open up my baitcasters, clean out the spools of water around the edges etc...then open up all boxes that were used that day, snip off line from tying on lures and well whatever else that got messy.  It's not a lack of fishing, but a obsession to make the day run smooth. 5seconds looking in a box saves time when looking through a mess...  See what I mean lol"

466277,Skud,2010-05-14 01:17:00,739,Here is my stack of lures. The less I fish the more I buy. The bags on the top two shelves are lures yet to be filed. Doing my part for the economy.    I opened up all the trays for a picture. I couldn't fit in the 5 tackle boxes and worm bag. I need a few more trays and another spinnerbait box to thin some of the over loaded ones out.    Now I need to sort through them to figure out which ones are going with me to the Muskoka Pike Tourny.

465040,tonka,2010-05-11 00:25:00,13,Not to get off topic but I always though you had to keep soft plastic baits on their bags or else they loose their scent. Is that true?
465046,johnl,2010-05-11 00:34:00,197,"mike the bass fisher you should add a jitterbug to your topwater lures,if you don't have one."
465054,PikeMolester,2010-05-11 00:49:00,428,I read it was fine as long as they are in close contact with the others
465058,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-11 00:55:00,3761," Meh, I keep them all together in that double sided Plano. Will most likely get another but I only plan on adding some more chunk trailers for this season really. I would like to remove 65% of those different tube colors. If you want them buy them off me haha but seriously you dont need too much...green, brown, and something chartreuse...craw,worm,tube,and chunks...but thats just me.  About the jitter bug, never fished one to be honest but a few friends swearer by them...im the same with a skitter pop, i catch so many fish with it...its mastering the lure that makes it special on every cast haha"
465061,GBW,2010-05-11 00:59:00,8460,"Those pic's were March last year so not so clean now... Also, that is my storage case and I have 2 other soft side bags I use that hold 2 or 3 trays each that I rotate all my lures do to what I'm fishing for that day. If I were to get up off my butt and take a pic now of my travel cases you would LOL at the mess.  But I know where it all is..."
465062,robertag,2010-05-11 01:00:00,42,"Okay, here's mine.  I've added a few more in the last few weeks while anticipating my trip to the French River Victoria day weekend... can't wait! "

465257,Syn,2010-05-11 16:06:00,519," You mean these 2 little guys? They are made by H2o xpress exclusively for Academy sports store in USA but you can find them on ebay for around $10 + a few more dollars for shipping. I got them a few months ago. I have not tried them yet but I think they would be killers for bass. I hope they don't get attacked by pike though because that would damage the nice finish.       For pike and musky I purchased heavier duty jerk/ swimbait lures (and inline spinner with trebles) with much bigger trebles and split rings. These have about 4/0 5/0 trebles and range in size 4.5"" to 7"". Also noticed some of them are coated extra thickly with epoxy but eventually all lures will succumb to the savagery of pike and muskie teeth.  "

I have spent hours each week watching every video on youtube under search results ""my tackle box"". Thousands of people sharing what they use and show off their set ups. Last year was my first season and I used my friends extra tackle. In the off season I became obsessed. I slowly started building a base to my first tackle box and my own lures and I am going to share what I have so far (not every single lure but most, leaving out terminal tackle and rods)Feel free to critique my choices and or share your experiences with any lures you have used. Everything is pretty much new and not used yet. Remember these are my first lures and its just a start. I'd love to see your album in detail no matter how much or little it is.  Next week-end we will make it to the Franny. We fish St-Lawrence,Lac St-Louis and Lake St-Francis. Pretty much the best smallmouth areas in Canada and I got alot of plastics and jighead combos (craws,gobies,jigs and tubes) for those smallmouth lunkers. Last year I didnt do much fishing deeper than 10-15feet. This year I am prepared. I do however have lures for largemouth, pike and walleye too. But after seeing the Canadian tourney record at Raisin' River I want to dial in those footballs this year.

464883,mpt,2010-05-10 16:22:00,158,"Here's something I posted on my blog site.   The Tackle Box The tackle box is essential to fishing and Spring is the prime time to organize. This can be a very daunting task. What’s important to your fishing? What’s important to your life? You’ve got some old lures, some that have been successful and some you’ve never used. It’s good to try to organize but not too critical. One of the most important goals is to keep things separated. Hooks, for example, which can scatter all over the box. Collect them, then separate them according to size and put each pile on a safety pin. You may not find the right size hook but if you do you’ll have all at your finger tips. At least you can find a similar size and have a good supply of each.  The bottom of the box is probably going to be harder if you’re like me. The space is never big enough. The size never changes but the stuff going in keeps getting bigger. When the box won’t close it’s time to reorder, I mean reorganize. First take it all out and then separate as best you can by order of importance, most used, highest potential to be used, never used but most liked or any other reason that would pertain to you. Try to get the piles down to a size that fits in a baggie. Arrange the baggies for importance and start to fill the bottom again. Once full keep the extra bags and store them in the plastic shopping bag you stored the extra bags in the last 10 years.  You’ll also have equipment that is essential to any fishing outing such as a fillet knife, a knife for emergencies (working on the boat or motor), a knife for cutting line (fishing and anchor), fingernail clippers for fishing line only, sun glasses, a lighter, antacid tabs, aspirin, prep H, sunscreen, duct tape and a candy bar. When all free space in the lure trays is full you will need to take some bags out from the bottom. Remember the least important bags come out first and put these in the plastic shopping bag.  Eventually you’ll get to a point that the bag of new gear fresh from the store, or catalog order, is bigger than the bags in the plastic shopping bag. This is a prime opportunity to purchase a new tackle box. Try to find the best bang for your buck in the largest size you can find. Now you’ll be able to organize the tackle boxes with certain subjects in mind. These could include general fishing, walleye, trout, shore fishing, trolling, lake or river, lure types and for me a kids fishing box for my grand-daughters. Each box has its own set of rules to consider for the importance of the gear. My problem now is it’s harder for me to remember which box is which. All the boxes are different sizes and shapes so I can usually associate each to their type of use. I have magic markered references on some, but not all. Some of the new boxes are more like bags and they’re black so duct tape is used to put the references on.  Now the problem is knowing which box/bag to take. Depending who I’m fishing with I may have 4 or 5 of the things. If I ever went fishing with my buddy Hankie on Lake Erie I would take 5 box/bag combos. The walleye box, the trolling bag, the bottom bounce bag, the plastic bodies bag and the general box. We were targeting walleye but switching techniques was always a consideration depending on the weather. Sometimes we caught waldos but as often as not the trip turned into a sheephead outing. Those fish are really fun to catch. Good luck to you on your spring organizing."
