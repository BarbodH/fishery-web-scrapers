908991,moxie,2015-04-09 11:28:00,1566,"Someone already mentioned Stocco and Moira... and people wonder why all the giants are gone from there? and why you see 25-50 boats on opener now.... Im glad that my musky days are over... except the odd outing... feel free to name lakes.... just remember that there are ALOT of people on here just looking for new water to explore. Not a bash... just reality. While we are at it.. where is the best crappie lakes you know of? I only want 15""s tho.... no bites? didn't think so So blame the guy that helps another guy out. Typical! Anyone ever tell you of a lake or spot on a lake? Give me a break. Instead of taking aim and pissing on me why don't you write your government and ask them why they and other governments have mismanaged your fishery and the moneys collected for decades? Oh I forgot, cause guys like me give away hot spots and that is why the fish are all gone."
908993,crappieperchhunter,2015-04-09 11:35:00,2582,I've caught dozens of muskies in my life...and I've never targeted them. Just pick a lake that has muskies use 4LB line and a 1/16 or 1/32 oz jig and pretend your fishing for bluegills or crappie.  I guarantee you will get your share.
909002,Loadman,2015-04-09 12:36:00,63,"Moxie not pissing on you just pointing out the obvious.... smaller lakes can only take so much pressure... mis managing starts with the angler... like I said I don't care anymore, but if you want to help out, I'm still waiting for the crappie spot?"
909007,porkpie,2015-04-09 12:49:00,2521,"Change that to pickerel and I'm on board with you!  I fished for musky for a while, but found them not to match the hype.  But fishing for pickerel in the kawarthas and the damn things can be a real nuisance."
909026,James77,2015-04-09 15:01:00,175,"It's funny you guys say that, check out the new River Monsters ""Canadian Terror"" episode on youtube or online. No spoilers but it'll make you laugh for sure."
909146,Rizzo,2015-04-09 22:41:00,4754,pigeon lake...get one or two pretty much guaranteed
909152,James77,2015-04-09 23:02:00,175,I've heard really good things about Pigeon
909155,lew,2015-04-09 23:21:00,12766,I've heard really good things about Pigeon  Pigeon is a great musky lake.
909164,Sinker,2015-04-09 23:44:00,8692,"All the kawartha lakes are good musky lakes. Pick a lake, spend some time on it, and before you know it, its the best musky lake. Ive been fishing the kawarthas for 25 years, and my favourite musky lake hasnt been mentioned here yet. Lol....funny how that works eh?  S."
909177,cowanjo,2015-04-10 01:04:00,249,"I think Restoule is not simple doesn't have GPS but has some nice ones for sure if you don't know where the rocks are can be pretty difficult.    If I had one choice there is no doubt where I would head for the opener - Cameron Lake/Pigeon lake or Lower Buckhorn - find a hump start casting a tube that's it - then find a weed edge and cast there, eventually you would connect. Fan of Red October but they all work great two colours black and black  Have fun and have release tools"
909192,SirCranksalot,2015-04-10 02:24:00,3291,"One lake, eh? Maybe a good idea---depend on who you ask!! "

Duly noted Loadman but that lake hasn't been a secret for a very long time and ya it sucks that our fisheries are going to hell in a hand basket but with proper care taken concerning catch and release practices as well as educating other anglers in the hopes they  help in managing  whats left what else can we do?  The rest of it lies with the powers that govern. I've pissed in their direction on more than a few occasions so my conscience is clear. How about yours?  As far as a Crappie spot I'll let you in on it as soon as I find it."
907701,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-02 17:49:00,8243,"Lake St. Clair is a Musky factory. It might be a tad more than 3 hours from the GTA, just drive faster. But from what I have read on forums around the west end of Erie and LSC it is a no brainer for numbers of fish, not trophy fish but sheer numbers of Musky. I read about many multiple fish catches in 1 day from locals."
907708,Craigson,2015-04-02 18:52:00,117,"A few years ago i was on a seadoo on Lake St Clair in August down by Stoney Point. There were literally hundreds of Musky sunning themselves in the clear water. It was honestly one of the craziest things i have seen, everywhere you looked it was muskies. 50""+ fish are landed every weekend on St Clair."
907712,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-02 19:04:00,8243,"Craigson,  I have heard that 50's are rare, but if it's true 50's are in there well even better for the Musky hunters. I want to give it a go this year. I just need to find a Musky guy that has some of those 50 buck lures. Plus I need to work out in the Gym before tossing those bricks for a day."
907713,BillM,2015-04-02 19:07:00,17367,"Troll, no need to cast, lol."

907735,lew,2015-04-02 20:49:00,12766,"There are some ski's on buckhorn , but they dont get that big. I caught around a 42 or three last summer, and now I'm looking to improve on that size. 50+ is my goal.  I only suggested Lower Buck because I was under the impression you only had the one day to fish and you said you were familiar with the lake.  If it's a 50 your looking for though, your better off heading east, north or west of the Kawarthas. The K's have some 50's but their few & far between."
907740,c10,2015-04-02 20:59:00,131,"aha wow, seems L. Buckhorn is a popular lake, I too have seen some large ones pulled from there.  But as Lew and some of the others said, the biggest ones are going to be found on the bigger bodies of water.  Will take you longer to figure those bodies out though of course..."

908413,Kawartha Kev,2015-04-06 21:24:00,281,Are you also on Lower Buckhorn James77? I don't get up near as much as I would like do to work but have had a cottage there for 20+ years.  Kawartha Kev  Sorry didn't mean to hijack the thread into a Lower Buckhorn thread.
908437,manitoubass2,2015-04-06 23:30:00,11391,You do have a sense of humour????  That was funny sir!
908438,James77,2015-04-06 23:33:00,175,What lakes would you guys recommend with a 15' Deep Wide Legend Aluminum with a 25HP in mind? Is that sufficient for Callander Bay or lake St.Clair weather dependent?
908442,DaveRoach,2015-04-06 23:50:00,202,"Are you also on Lower Buckhorn James77? I don't get up near as much as I would like do to work but have had a cottage there for 20+ years.  Kawartha Kev  Sorry didn't mean to hijack the thread into a Lower Buckhorn thread. No worries Kev, James and I fish together. Was just looking for other alternatives as I've caught some sort of Muskie bug and can't stop watching others catch 50 plus inchers on youtube. Is there a doctor in the house"
908458,Kawartha Kev,2015-04-07 00:39:00,281,"Well all I can say is you will be able to get lots of musky action on Lower Buckhorn but you will definitely have to work for a 50"". Good luck!!  Kawartha Kev"
908476,DaveRoach,2015-04-07 01:11:00,202,"Thanks Kev, but I could hardly call it work."
908491,Raycaster,2015-04-07 01:47:00,528,"James, I'm no expert but find LSC like most big lakes, its all in the weather and boating smart. LSC is big and not much protection out in the middle.  If you have a small boat scout ahead and decide either Mitchel Bay side or Belle River.... not both. On water everything looks so close but your 25hp will tell you another story."
908498,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-07 02:04:00,8243,James it's all weather dependant. My almost 20 foot deep V StarCraft with a wide beam can become a floating coffin if I get caught in 40K or less winds on any lake or river. We start looking at good marine weather reports the day before at least before heading out on any water. I have learned much about deep water in the last 20 years of living on the lake. For another thread.

908972,James77,2015-04-09 05:00:00,175,Thanks for the info guys. Is there a specific spot to find accurate conditions for Lake st Clair and Nippissing? What wind conditions do you consider safe?  Thanks

907408,moxie,2015-04-01 01:53:00,1566,Stocco and Moira Lakes. Small enough so they won't overwhelm you and large enough to hold some pretty decent Skis. And we've seen some doozies in them.
907409,Nipfisher,2015-04-01 01:57:00,2449,Nipissing. Callander Bay narrows down the water to cover.
907411,captpierre,2015-04-01 02:31:00,2521,Conventional wisdom is catch the most skis in June. But bigger ones in the fall. Tough to beat the Kawarthas.

The lake is loaded with muskies and it's within your 3 hour drive. Clip on a big spinnerbait or bucktail and go cast the weeds & rocks.
