Great to bring attention to any cause but isn't Pink a bit over done already?

I wont mess with him,LOL  There are many changes these days I dont agree with,but this pink day thing,Im all for the stop the bullying.. This is something I have seen happen when I was younger alot. The fear on some of them kids when getting bullied was not nice to watch. Getting beat on by one or more fellow peers. I stepped in when I could and got into many fights doing so. Not many back then would be your friend if you stepped up. That brought on more fights for me. I dont regret the fighting. it was my thing back then. Even had a few 2-3 against one, due to standing up for those that couldnt.    Kudos to them.  http://globalnews.ca/news/1927265/day-of-pink-aims-to-end-bullying-and-discrimination/"

There was a Gay Motor Sales close to where I grew up and a good friend at the time was John Gay, there was no stigma attached to gay at that time. I don't recall being gay or homosexual being a crime but buggery was a crime."

It sounds like you are saying being gay is a negative thing....no wonder then people get bullied for being gay. Suggesting a color is representative of a persons sexuality only perpetuates the stereotypes which people base and justify their bigoted, discriminatory and bullying behaviour.  To go further with my rant lets talk about gender stereotypes and the whole pink camo/fishergirl thing...or maybe not....."

And yes I looked HOT  1981. Haven't bought anything with pink in it since then. No problem with pink on a guy. If I had an office type job I'm sure I would probably have some other stuff with pink in it. Never understood how any colour can be ruled as a do not wear colour  Never saw any bullying where I grew up. None...Zero.  Lots of merciless teasing though....lots.  I think there is a fine line between teasing and bullying and a lot of people that claim to be bullied just need to grow a thicker skin."

The color..  Well I'm 50 years old and pink is not a color that any of the gay people I know associate with their identity, it was ascribed to them. The Gay community I know is as diverse as it can get and does not define itself in terms of a color and I find it offensive when people feel they have a right to define other peoples identities based on whatever."
