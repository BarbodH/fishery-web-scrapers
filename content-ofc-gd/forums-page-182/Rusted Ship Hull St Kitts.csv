909381,Yellow Fever,2015-04-11 12:40:00,139,Thank you for the link...wish they could get rid of it
909395,206,2015-04-11 14:18:00,563,I thought it looked cool? one of those things i look forward to seeing on the way down QEW

909559,dave524,2015-04-12 11:34:00,4508,"I thought it looked cool? one of those things i look forward to seeing on the way down QEW  Guess you don't have to look at a rusted out piece of scrap iron everyday, nothing cool about it, they put shingles on a steel hulled boat and a couple of iron pipes for masts to make it look like an old frigate or something. Maybe we should have some older pimped out cars abandoned in the ditches along the highways cause they looked ""  CooL ""."
909561,bigugli,2015-04-12 12:27:00,6138,"  It's been done before.  It's called the cadillac ranch. Really kinda ""cool""."
909620,BillM,2015-04-12 15:58:00,17367,Anyone remember when it caught fire?  LOL!!
909643,dave524,2015-04-12 16:51:00,4508,"Yeah , but then again I remember when Donnie Campbell had the marina inside the harbour  and to get to Lake Ontario you has to go under the QEW bridge."
909658,Steve,2015-04-12 18:50:00,2075,musta been tough to guide that big boat through the rocks....  bad parking job however.
909659,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-12 18:59:00,8243,"We have many visits from family in western NY, they all think it's cool too. I know they have used it for a few movie shoots even after the fire. I really don't see the objection to it. A lot less ugly than the thousands upon thousands of billboards on US highways like I 75 and I 95 for sure."
