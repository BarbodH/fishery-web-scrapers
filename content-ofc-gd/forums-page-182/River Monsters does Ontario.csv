907516,jbailey,2015-04-01 18:09:00,866,i'm surprised its not about catfish
907593,FishAbout,2015-04-02 00:04:00,106,I wonder when it will air on Canadian tv. Looked at my guide for April 5 and nowhere to be found. The Canadian animal plant is different then US one. Normally its on discovery channel here.  I think we will have to wait a bit for it to air here. Hope I'm wrong though.
907599,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-02 00:43:00,8243,"I had the same autocorrect thing happen here when I went to type the short form for Muskellunge. It came out very badly. It was about the guys bashing M U S K Y's over the head and throwing them over board to die a slow death. It sure sounded terrible when muslims came up instead of M U S K Y's. Oh my, I edited that really fast."
907606,Moosebunk,2015-04-02 01:35:00,3970,"Too funny this thread.  Started watching his show on Netflix but it didn't stick.  Will try again.  We all call BIG fish MONSTERS right?   Had a fella in Moose Factory with a totally straight face and as serious as ever tell me that he hooked into a 72-inch pike on Kesagami Lake, fought it to exhaustion over an hour, pulled it up onto the dock he was standing on at the main lodge, then put a rifle bullet into it's head.  dang' river monsters eh!?!"
907888,mistyriver1,2015-04-03 15:02:00,600,Love this show.  Always thought he should do one on skis.
908325,Roy,2015-04-06 11:47:00,13728,Interesting spin on muskies. I guess PowerPro sales will drop now.  http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/river-monsters/videos/canadian-horrors-how-to-catch-a-muskie/?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=RiverMonsters
908335,AKRISONER,2015-04-06 14:01:00,5558,looks to be close to 45+? what do the musky guys think here?
908338,BillM,2015-04-06 14:19:00,17367,Low to mid 40's would be a good guess.
908349,manitoubass2,2015-04-06 15:12:00,11391,"What???????  No 55""?  Lol"
908350,BillM,2015-04-06 15:20:00,17367,Are we sure that's even a muskie?  Kinda looks like an Atlantic to me.
908351,Blue Lk,2015-04-06 15:23:00,337,"The show didn't air in Canada,but I do know that 1 of the lodges Wade fished with is North Shore Lodge on Eagle Lk,I tried to paste a link to their Facebook page but had no success ,checkout the page yourself if you want to see the type of muskie fishing this area has to offer.There are some photos of Wade.Btw I used to be next door neighbors with Scott the owner."
908353,manitoubass2,2015-04-06 15:31:00,11391,Not to derail but were you around about oh say 10 years or so ago when they got hit with that tornado?
908356,Blue Lk,2015-04-06 15:45:00,337,"Back to M2B2,yes I was living on Eagle,BIG mess."
908365,manitoubass2,2015-04-06 16:31:00,11391, That was one heck of a storm  When I drove through it looked like a warzone
908709,Rizzo,2015-04-08 00:41:00,4754,"....he had one episode he made up ridiculous facts about some monstrous pike. I suddenly realized that where I had been interested in past episodes, he was probably full of cr@p then too....I just didn't know it because I never heard of these other fish! I guess the locals from those episodes had a good laugh too about his hyperbolic stories. Oh well, having said that, I will still watch!"
908718,Blue Lk,2015-04-08 00:58:00,337,"Just watched this on youtube.SUCH drama. Spirit rock?We call it the reef in front of Dave Kelly's place. Best way to Eagle Lk is airplane? I guess hwy 17 that runs right by some of the lake isn't a good idea? I allways thought this was just another so called ""reality show"",now I know for sure. I lived on Eagle or 15 yrs & let my kids swim in those monster infested waters.My bad."
908723,manitoubass2,2015-04-08 01:14:00,11391,Lol we swim there every year at the powwow.  And yes the highway is right beside the darn lake
908724,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-08 01:29:00,8243,"A few years ago my brother that worked for Shaw told me reality shows aren't so real after all. Just when I'm just getting over the fact WWE wrestling is all made up. I made a lot of money betting on wrestling over the years. I do have to say that Wade has caught some pretty big fish, most of which are some strain of Catfish. Now if he catches a Yellow fin Tuna casting a spinning rod I'll be glued to the TV set."
909213,limeyangler,2015-04-10 05:16:00,5204,lol...spirit rock!
907444,AKRISONER,2015-04-01 12:51:00,5558,"http://northernontario.travel/sunset-country/river-monsters-filmed-in-vermilion-bay-for-its-season-premiere  SPOILER ALERT the preview contains footage of a musky, it kinda spoils it!  Im pumped to watch this though, im curious to see just how big of a musky he is going to catch.  I think we can all agree hes nuts, the guy will fish for weeks on end all day and night just to ensure that he gets footage of catching the beast."
907446,Roy,2015-04-01 13:05:00,13728,"Yeah, I read it here. http://ontariofishingnetwork.com/2015/river-monsters-season-premiere-filmed-in-vermilion-bay-ontario/"
907447,BillM,2015-04-01 13:07:00,17367,It's going to be interesting how he spins this one.  Anyone remember the sturgeon episode?  lol
907450,lew,2015-04-01 13:14:00,12766,Never seen the show before but I'll have a look when it comes on.  Thanks for the heads-up
907455,quickme,2015-04-01 13:45:00,261,looking forward to watching this.  It'll be a treat to see him no bottom bounce for fish for once.
907463,Rich Clemens,2015-04-01 14:06:00,3131,I have the date written down to watch this one.   we'll just see what kind of monsters Ontario really has.
907464,manitoubass2,2015-04-01 14:08:00,11391,In the sturgeon episode didnt he also target pike? I remember him saying something about pike getting up to 5 feet long haha.
907465,DRIFTER_016,2015-04-01 14:16:00,10439,"In the sturgeon episode didnt he also target pike? I remember him saying something about pike getting up to 5 feet long haha.  The longest pike ever recorded and confirmed was 152 cm (60 in) long and weighed 28 kg (62 lb). A pike of 60.5 in (154 cm) was caught and released in May 2004 in Apisko Lake, Manitoba. Historic reports of giant pike, caught in nets in Ireland in the late 19th century, of 41–42 kg (90–93 lb) with a length of 173–175 cm (67–68 in), were researched by Fred Buller and published in The Domesday Book of Mammoth Pike."
907469,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-01 14:34:00,8243,"I like his show on the whole. Many interesting places he fishes for ""Monsters"" and of course the legends of people being swallowed whole while fishing from a small boat or washing laundry by the river doesn't hurt the hype. All the ""reality"" shows have the commercial cliff-hanger just before cutting to commercial. Did he get swallowed up by that giant mutant fish in Chernobyl? Did Cletus get pulled into the Bayou on the latest episode of "" Swamp People"" just before going to break ?  He has caught some big fish and works hard for them, I'll give him that. You very well can't produce a TV show called ""River Monsters"" without the monsters."
907470,bare foot wader,2015-04-01 14:36:00,1354,"had a fly fishing guide tell me they have 60"" pike in the reservoirs in Colorado...  I like his shows, refreshing format compared to most fishing shows and exotic destinations  I fully expect  ""local folk lore claims musky occasionally attack small children, truly frightening fish"""
907472,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-01 14:45:00,8243,"The best thing about that show and the Canadian guy Cyril (I don't remember his last name, sorry Cyril) is they aren't a n hour long commercial disguised as a. fishing show.  No flogging rods and reels, BBQ's, camping equipment, leader material, line, boat accessories, oil, tires or Dodge  Ram trucks along with every other imaginable thing to try to sell us every Saturday morning."
907475,manitoubass2,2015-04-01 14:50:00,11391,"Im not saying its impossible. Its just a huge tease and embellishment thats all.  He makes it sound like thats a normal pike.  But I suppose thats the ""lure"" of his show.  He does it well enough that I myself still watch? so I shouldnt complain.  I swim in big pike territory, maybe ill be the next to get killed by one? After all I wear a perch pattern colorado blade around my neck ???"
907477,Gallie,2015-04-01 15:03:00,1215,"I am looking forward to this episode as well, i love the show and it beats anything on tv for me. As for giant pike my favourite "" story"" is that of an old farmer in ireland that killed a 90+ lb pike with an oar because and i quote  ""it was stealing his livestock including goats from the shore"" Haha awesome, id love to see the gut on her."
907485,fishing n autograph,2015-04-01 15:16:00,2540,I think the idea is going after fish that have attacked people and there have been stories of large Muslims biting kids
907488,porkpie,2015-04-01 15:53:00,2521,"LOL, FNA, I'm not quoting that one, but it was an epic iphone auto correct error.....LOL"

I like Cyril too. His last name is Chauquet. He has a new show along with his Fishing Adventurer show now called Wild Catch. It's a great show as well."
907491,BillM,2015-04-01 16:00:00,17367,Cryil and Krupa are my favs (Even though Krupa doesn't have a show anymore)
