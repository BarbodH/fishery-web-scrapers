909096,Beavertail,2015-04-09 18:58:00,331,"We will never know exactly what REALLY happened that day...but one thing for sure is Stan Jonathan broke quite a few ""cardinal rules"" of gun handling. That I'm sure we can all agree on. I'm going to dumb things down here, and give my thoughts on what I think happened that day. Again, just my opinion.  Stan shoots at what he thinks is a deer. Upon closer inspection he realizes it's a camo-clad bowhunter. Oh S---, now what? He panics and makes up some noodle-and-bull story about a ""phantom buck"" that he was shooting at. How could you disprove it? As far as I can tell from reading the articles no deer was ever found though, how convenient.  Now I don't think we should strap Stan to the electric chair, but the idea of him walking away Scot free does not sit well with me either. I do believe this was an accident, I do believe Stan really thought he was shooting at a deer, but I also believe that he lied his way out of it all and the system made it way too easy."

If you can't identify the target, or the final location of the bullet, then you haven't met the standard that one would expect of a responsible shooter or hunter.""  Did you quoters that like to cherry pick small parts of larger dialogue miss the part where I said this in the beginning..a fact we are totally in agreement on..that you are repeating back to me almost verbatim...as if I see it otherwise? I would respectfully suggest you aren't following the meaning of the posts in their entirety..nor displaying them as I intend them because we are clearly in agreement on the subject of safe shooting and the court's decision.  I was simply responding to the suggestion of a person being beyond your target..that it is near impossible to ascertain at the ranges we are discussing the presence of a camo wearing person intentionally concealing themselves in the woods..and that regardless of due care its possible someone could be unaware of that person..being that their sole reason to conceal themselves in camo was to avoid detection.   I am uncertain how you guys ensure this isn't the case when you are hunting..  As I stated before..Jonathan didn't satisfy either requirement...and reread post #70 if you think I am in anyway defending his actions...hunting experience and teaching experience aside..its the court case and the way the law interprets actions that I am speaking about...and no amount of hunting experience can prepare you for  the way a prosecutor and judge would view words like careless and reasonable..unless you can compare it to similar cases..where something we would see as careless a non hunter (likely the entire occupancy of the courtroom lol) would see as reasonable and accidental."

I didn't say there was a deer found..I simply stated my opinion on the matter of the mystery deer in my first post..that had the bullet passed through a deer there would be physical evidence of that.  The discussion leading from that was the relevance that deer would have to the case.  The deer doesn't have to be 'found' to be entered as a defence, and certainly not to be discussed. In a discussion forum one discusses the facts of the case, and the what-ifs surrounding it. Like say there was a deer..as was on-topic and relevant to the thread..how would that effect the outcome?  I also pointed out the deer sighting wasn't widely reported until very recently..which would be unusual considering the profound effect it would have had on public perception and the legal decision.

The law IMO is two sided(and I dont mean anything rascist or against my own people)  If you search hard enough, there are papers from the queen, that states aboriginals are to be treated differently in law(not in those words). Aboriginals in Canada, in legal issue, the crowns duty is to exhaust all methods possible before jail.  Ill see if I can find the papers. When my good friend a native alcohol and drug counsellor passed, I had to clean out his office. He had copies of these documents and many other treaty papers. The family had no use so I kept them.  This, IMO is at least manslaughter, even if totally by accident(which none of us will ever know)  Im all for aboriginals, but im also for humans. I believe certain rights are owed to the aboriginals, murder or manslaughter or rape is not justifiable for anyone.  So anyhow, lets keep the rascist stuff out of the thread(which has been good thus far) but it is NOT rascist to say natives are held to a different standard. Its just truth, and upheld by the highest courts of Canada.  Not to derail, but to provide an example.  Rrfn man is charged with rape. Pleads down to assault. No jail time only conditions.  Rrfn man caught at US border in attempt to smuggle oxycontin. Caught. As a minor, sent to a halfway house. Escapes. Returns to rrfn. Untouchable for years although they want him extradited. I believe he was facing 30 years in MN. Ovee the next few years, robs half the people on the rez, assaults, a whole slew of things. Finally he robs a canada post office and is finally apprehended. He faced something like 70 charges. Goes to court, gets like two years or something rediculous.  Dont believe me? Search zachory leanord and manitou or rainy river first nations.

908860,pics,2015-04-08 17:38:00,1268,I saw the justice or lack thereof in Caledonia.. It isn't right.. The hunt the natives conduct here in Hamilton is done with bows and it appears to be well run and safe. The area is closed to the public and hunter numbers are limited. One of them was right along the 403 where it goes down the escarpment in Ancaster so its very close to populated areas. Safety should always be a factor no matter where hunting takes place.. I wish hunters of all backgrounds had a chance to hunt there as well but we don't... I should add that my wifes grandmother was native and I have cousins who are half native(one teaches at a school on six nations and lectures at universities about native history and rights)... we sometimes agree to disagree... lol
908862,doubleheader,2015-04-08 17:59:00,497,"Beavertail, I question whether I should respond but here goes. Probability was brought into the discussion as it provides definition as to whether, when combined with other facts, it is within reason to conclude this tragedy was an accident. For instance, it's far easier to conclude that a person was accidentally shot while wearing camo, than while wearing fluorescent orange. It's far easier to conclude that a person was accidentally shot wearing camo at 300 yds than at a shorter distance. So the probability question is at the very heart of this issue. It's what our legal systems (Canadian and US) are based upon, i.e., when all the facts are known is there reasonable doubt. Reasonable infers probability. You go on to say the shooter is responsible and should be held accountable and whether it was an accident or not is irrelevant.  Thankfully the law is a little more complex than that. The shooter may be accountable in the eyes of the law even if he did not see the archer if it came to light that he was impaired or his actions were otherwise reckless. Here's another analogy. A man is driving a car on a rainy dark night. He hits a child in the street and that child dies. The child was wearing dark clothing. Is the man guilty of a crime? Probably not because an investigation would reveal it would not have been ""reasonable"" to expect this driver to see the child given the conditions. Now, that said, what if his BAC was over the limit or he was driving impaired, what if he was speeding, not wearing his prescription eyeglasses, or texting at the time of the accident? Chances are in each case the driver would be subject to some fine, period of incarceration, or both.

909001,smally21,2015-04-09 12:36:00,993,"A very thoughtful post DH..and if I may cherry pick a detail ""otherwise wreckless""..  The crown agreed Jonathan did not know he was shooting at a person..which removes the mens rea, i.e. the intent, which removes the criminality of it being murder.  However, it does not remove, and if effect confirms, the carelessness or wrecklessness of his actions. ""Dangerous"" or ""Careless"" use of a firearm or discharge of a firearm exist as secondary charges for someone that exhibits negligence without intent to harm..similar to gross disregard..its still a criminal offence and this case is textbook for its use.  As a 30 year competitive shooter and gun advocate the idea of not knowing where a bullet ends up is abhorrent to me..that you would discharge a centre-fire rifle without clear identification of target and area behind the target just baffles me.,.perhaps too much time in the classroom with CFSC courses and CRFSC courses and RSO time has me too much in that direction. I don't know if you have to be one to understand the 'community' aspect of looking out for the group as a whole through responsible and safe use?  Im not much of a hunter but surrounded by them and immersed in their culture..the idea that you took a shot at something that you could barely identify as an animal, at a range that is clearly outside of most recreational hunter's limits (read who regularly has the facilities and time to practice 3-400 yd shots..almost no one)..most ethical hunters wouldn't think of taking a shot so out of their established limits...and would never take a shot that wouldn't have had in their scope image the POI on the target that would produce a bang-flop quickly dead, non-suffering animal.  Add on all the hunting regs violations (hunting from vehicle, shooting across roadway, shooting within 10m of roadway, center-fire in shotgun season..(and yes I understand there are different requirements for aboriginals - it doesn't remove the 'common sense' of these regs) and you have a gross disregard for the consequences of pulling the trigger. It doesn't matter what the victim was wearing..and why he was there. The onus of where a bullet ends up is 100% on the shooter.  If you can't identify the target, or the final location of the bullet..then you haven't met the standard that one would expect from a responsible shooter or hunter.  To me..as the teacher or the student the first part of putting a gun in your hands..for the first time or the millionth..is the consequence and the responsibility behind its use.  IMO this guy made a decision that reflects poorly on shooters and hunters from both sides of the reserve...and most certainly met the standard for conviction.  The bullet passing through the deer first would be provable..not to mention would have exonerated Jonathan both legally and publicly and would have been brought up immediately..not years later."

The fact that the bullet passed through a deer is immaterial, the shot is not a safe shot if there is a person beyond the deer. The onus is always on the hunter to make sure that the shot and beyond is safe, just like you would not fire at a deer if there are buildings beyond or where the bullet would cross a roadway if there was a pass through or miss. Criminal intent no but criminal negligence yes. As a former hunter education instructor and voter I find the whole thing disgusting."
909072,Old Ironmaker,2015-04-09 17:35:00,8243,"He was not exonerated. I believe a trial must take place to be exonerated, charges were dropped, there's a difference. A civil suit is still an option but you can't get blood from a stone. I was at the rez this AM and this thing is still the talk of the town. I won't repeat what was said to me because that's rumour but I can tell you 100% of the guys I talked to are not happy with Jonathans actions and do not defend him in any way. I told them about this thread and asked me to pass on that all of them are hunters and don't want to be painted by the same brush as none said they would have taken that shot, no way."
909074,smally21,2015-04-09 17:44:00,993,"It is entirely material. The presence of the deer validates the shot..the fact that someone was beyond the deer in no man's land could and likely would be deemed accidental..as there would not be knowledge nor expectation for someone to be there...unless of course in plain sight.  In a court case that was evaluating Jonathon's questionable selection of a target..presenting the actual target (in this case a legally harvested deer) would most certainly be evidentiary material. I can't see seeing it otherwise?  Building or roadways are very different, and now where near a legitimate comparisonas they are clearly evident..it could well be deemed reasonable that a person in a field intentionally concealing themselves with camoflauge is a situation beyond a hunter's control..imagine every deer hunter, when stalking bush, had to satisfy themselves prior to shooting an identified target, that no one was hiding in the bushes behind the deer. It would be the end of hunting.  A dead deer at the scene would have drastically changed this scenario..the whole basis of the careless discharge was that Jonathon hadn't properly identified the target..not that he hadn't identified the background.  Had he established this is the deer I took the shot at..everything about the case would be different..to the extreme that its possible no charges would be laid.  You make your comment as if the shooter in your example knew there to be a person..which would satisfy both dangerous and careless use, and also doesn't match the agreed upon facts, that both the crown and the defense stated Jonathon had no knowledge that he was firing at a person..nor a belief that there was someone there....that my comment is related to. The entire case was based on his mistaken identification of the target and his poor judgement in taking the shot..a dead deer at his feet confirms the target..and goes along way towards justifying the shot."
909092,Sinker,2015-04-09 18:43:00,8692,"ITS THE NUMBER ONE RULE WHEN TAKING ANY SHOT!!!!!  ALWAYS be sure of whats BEYOND your target.  This whole thread has me fuming!!

High power rifle rounds travelling willy nilly through a southern woodlot just don't qualify as a safe shot to me.

That is proof we have 2 tiered justice in Ontario.  As far as not belonging on the reservation I'm sure some of those living on the rez believe non residents shouldn't be there either. I for one go to both 6 Nations as well as New Credit all the time and feel very comfortable doing so. When we first moved here that wasn't true, I believed what I heard about the rez. Now I'm going to say something very racist here and may take flack for it. The local kids there are more polite and courteous than any of the white trash I come across in downtown Hamilton begging on the street for loose change and cigarettes each and every time I go there. We do not go there to buy cheap gas and cheap smokes. It is our #1 choice for breakfast, lunches and occasionally dinner. We also love going to the track for the races and to watch hockey and lacrosse games. All the business people there welcome with open arms non residents money I guarantee that 100%.

908790,doubleheader,2015-04-08 12:37:00,497,"Wearing orange would of definitely made a difference, however bow hunters need to wear camo to get close enough for a quality shot.  The problem in this case is someone else hunting big game with a firearm during the bow season. In  every area I have ever hunted this is NOT allowed for the safety of the bow hunter.  As someone else already mentioned you MUST ID your target at all times before pulling that trigger. So again the shooter is liable here. Now if Jonathan was allowed by Six Nation law to hunt as he did and didn't break any laws whatsoever, then his girl friend should be suing Six Nation for irresponsible laws/codes that led to the death of Kosid and  Jonathan  for whatever her lawyer can get.  BTW hunting as proven by stats is much safer then fishing or even riding a bike.  As a long time rifle and bow hunter I have to disagree with your assertion that bow hunters must wear camo to get close enough to their quarry for a lethal shot. Deer really do not see very well, especially colors. This is the theory behind blaze camo, a camo pattern that uses a fluorescent orange background. Deer rely almost exclusively on their sense of smell and ability to pick up unnatural movement and sound. Next time you're in the woods and come across deer, just stop, more than likely they have already made you but it is just as likely that if you freeze they will go back to feeding.   Also, assuming it was during the rut, it would not be unusual if this archer was using deer estrus or some other scent to lure the buck close to his stand, and if that were true, it would also be very possible that the hunter shot at a buck, missed the deer, and hit the camouflaged hunter. How could this hunter be expected to see a camoflauged hunter at 300 yds? I've had hunters walk past me and I've remained undetected at 10 yds. Finally, while I wouldn't condone hunting from a vehicle, that also may very well be legal; it is legal most everywhere when a person has a physical disability. So, IMHO, folks shouldn't be so quick to convict this man. It was a terrible tragedy for sure."

Crown attorney George Orsini told the Superior Court of Justice in Brantford on Thursday that his office was withdrawing the charges of criminal negligence causing death and careless use of a firearm against the retired Boston Bruin and Six Nations hockey star. Jonathan, 59, was not present for the announcement. Orsini said that on Nov. 11, 2012, Jonathan was hunting with his brother on Six Nations land near Third Line Road, where he spotted what he believed to be a deer from 300 yards away. Using a .270 Weatherby Magnum Mark V, a high-powered rifle, Jonathan took a single shot. The brothers found Jonathan's target and realized it was actually a man wearing camouflage. Orsini said the brothers called 9-1-1 and said a prayer for the deceased man, who was later identified as Kosid, a Hamilton resident who was bow hunting on a friend's land. Kosid was shot in the back at approximately 8 a.m. Six Nations Police arrested and charged Jonathan on Nov. 14, 2012. ""There is no question Mr. Jonathan thought he was shooting at a deer,"" Orsini said. Orsini said that after further case review, there isn't sufficient evidence to prove the criminal charges. Justice Alan Whitten said the circumstances of the shooting are ""very tragic,"" but he can understand the Crown attorney's decision to withdraw the charges. Kosid, 28, was engaged to be married at the time of his death. His son was eight months old when he passed away."

Not defending the shooter, just curious about the clothing.  Lew, blaze orange is not required during the bow season. Really there is no gun season in the area that allows a .270 rifle, there is a controlled hunter number/lottery season of 5 days that allows shotguns and muzzleloaders in the area. That said, we are talking First Nations here and they have their own set of rules, when it comes to methods, season and limits.  Edit: I don't believe the regular shotgun season was open at the time so the guy was legal. Actually they suspend the archery season for the duration of the legal gun hunt so there are not archers and gun hunters in the field at the same time."

Just seems odd to me that when your hunting deer with a gun you need to wear orange so other hunters can see you and you don't get shot, yet when your hunting deer with a bow you wear camouflage to become less visible when there's hunters that shoot at every noise they hear.

I will not repeat them here because they are just that, rumor and speculation. I don't believe everything written in the Turtle Island newspaper, same as other newspapers, they all have an agenda but not as blatant as Turtle Islands.  What Paquette said in the Spec article about a witness seeing a Deer that wasn't acting normal (and this is the best of ridiculous) it matched the description of the Deer that Jonathan claimed to shoot. How many descriptions of deer don't match others, it was a buck a doe or a fawn, that's it. Maybe missing a piece of the rack, maybe, can one see details from 300 yds?  I think and pray politics did NOT play a role in the crowns decision not to prosecute. I would love to see all the evidence first hand.
