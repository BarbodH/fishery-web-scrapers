909575,JJSP,2015-04-12 13:21:00,1,"I have a 2014 14 ft Legend Prosport (tiller) and the boat came with one seat base in the floor on the port side of the boat (same side as the rod storage locker).  I want to add a second seat base on the starboard side.  Just wondering if anyone has a 14 ft Legend Prosport with two seat bases in the floor from the factory, as I have seen them there in pictures.  I'm looking for the measurement of where the starboard seat base is located to properly place the seat base in the floor.  I want to place this properly because I may add a steering console one day.  I believe the port and starboard seat base measurements are different because of the rod locker, or I would just simply transfer the measurement over.  Iâ€™m looking for a measurement from the live well area to the centre of the starboard seat base and a measurement from the bottom of the starboard side (where the side meets the floor) to the centre of the seat base. If anyone can help, thanks.  If not, I'll just give it a good guesstimate."
