This is a popular parking spot with access to the Lower Credit River and the City of Mississauga has shut it down effective immediately. Signs posted (in the last 2 days) state that parked vehicles will be towed. I'm not going to post any specific location details, but those of you who have used this parking area should recognize it accordingly. With the oncoming river season opening up, hopefully some of you will avoid disappointment and a potential tow.    "
