909616,Steve,2015-04-12 15:39:00,2075,"just keep telling yourself that.  no longer are cops watching over society.  now society is watching over society ... cops can go back to administering the law, not creating it as they feel fit."
909617,fishing n autograph,2015-04-12 15:41:00,2540," Mike Brown was a violent felon who robbed a store, attacked a cop and tried to take his sidearm. Not only did witness evidence state that so did forensic science. He was cleared three times but the witch hunt couldn't indict.  You my friend need to stay off the internet because not everything you read is real"
909619,Steve,2015-04-12 15:51:00,2075,"again, keep telling yourself that.  whatever lets you sleep at night.  blue blood runs thick and strong no doubt....but blue blood is not as strong as the public in which they are hired to protect.   now the blues get to think twice before they do anything...""little brother is watching""."
909621,Steve,2015-04-12 16:01:00,2075,"oh, and it really bothers me that you think I ""follow"" the freethought project or cop block.  i'm not sure what either of those even are.  I read all news sources. the ones that discuss the planting of evidence are sources like nytimes and the mirror (UK).  here's a simple picture...cause we know its easier to follow pictures than words.....it should help you understand what you are trying to protect. and no, nothing from freethought or cop block....    I said it before, and I'll say it again....blue blood runs thick.  any professional worth a dime would see what was done and try and apologize for their ""own"" and advise that the actions of a bad few don't represent many...but that isn't what you did....  instead you suggest planting evidence was only seen by someone with a tinfoil hat on....  I guess we can see who REALLY needs to have some ""free thought"" of their own!!!"
909623,Steve,2015-04-12 16:13:00,2075,"don't want to lock up this thread....Roy, my comments are done on this."
909627,fishing n autograph,2015-04-12 16:19:00,2540,Actually it was edited for a spelling mistake but that's okay.  I don't need to edit my actions. Contrary to popular belief not all cops run around violating peoples rights and doing what they want.  You cite one incident. I didn't say I support it or anything on it. But to throw an entire profession under the bus for something that didn't even occur in Canada is rediculous. I had contact with thousands of people in thousands of different situations and not one complaint or investigation against me. Nor have I ever witnessed any wrong doing.  The media sensationalizes these few incidents and then suddenly everything police do is wrong.  Take the shooting in Kitchener last week. Waterloo Region has had 3 fatal police shootings in 40 years and suddenly there's nothing but police brutality?? Give me a break.
909675,porkpie,2015-04-12 20:38:00,2521,It ain't worth arguing it man!  Keep on keeping on!
909680,aplumma,2015-04-12 21:09:00,6896,Let us see if anyone has an answer to the posters question. This debate is not going to get better and it will be locked because of that fact.   Art
909689,fishing n autograph,2015-04-12 21:32:00,2540,"Here's my opinion on the investment, you'll have to wait, most services in Ontario don't even have dash cams. The cost is enormous. I believe that a fleet of cameras and storage and hardware for a fleet was around 4 million if I can remember right"
909733,Big Cliff,2015-04-12 23:29:00,6899,"4 million? Whinnie the Poo wastes billions so 4 million is nothing! Oh, but wait this investment might make sense so it probably won't happen!"
909748,Raf,2015-04-12 23:54:00,3495,"i dont know or really care if it makes sense but I agree Cliff, 4 mil is a drop or in the bucket for the liberal$"
909749,Terry,2015-04-12 23:56:00,14456,that 4 mill is most likely  per station
909759,fishing n autograph,2015-04-13 00:25:00,2540,4 mill is a lot for even the largest services budget
909760,captpierre,2015-04-13 00:31:00,2521,Looks like we might be too late to invest. Body cam stocks have shot up during the last year. One of them by 456%. Darn.
909763,farsider,2015-04-13 00:38:00,456,"There would be associated savings with them.  Less people would challenge ""resisting arrest"" and the like in court if they were shown the videos of them doing it.  So, court and lawyers costs should go down.  Less ""frivolous"" lawsuits tying up the court system complaining of brutality and the like.  These puppies pay for themselves actually.....  What was that stock name again...?  Cheers, Mark"
909772,moxie,2015-04-13 01:45:00,1566," yeah, it's a lot safer here where only the criminals have guns Yup. Cake walk in comparison."
909406,captpierre,2015-04-11 15:36:00,2521,Thinking of an investment opportunity. Looks like cops will all be wearing body cameras in the future. Anybody know who is the leading manufacturer of these things?
909413,Fisherman,2015-04-11 16:07:00,7201,If I'm not mistaken there's a bunch out there already.
909418,lew,2015-04-11 17:06:00,12766,"Guess they'll work both ways, if the cop does everything by the book and someone complains about him, the camera should prove the cop right.  If the cop screws up, it'll prove he did it...maybe.  I'm 110% pro cop, always have been, and hopefully these cameras will help the good cops whenever there's a discrepancy.."
909422,captpierre,2015-04-11 17:49:00,2521,There's new video from California were the cops beat the snot out of a submitting captured crook.  I don't want to develop a camera. Just want to invest in a company who's sales will likely jump.
909424,OhioFisherman,2015-04-11 18:07:00,6623,"I wonder if our politicians are ahead of the curve and have already invested heavily in the companies that make them? I can see the thought of lawsuits against police encouraging more people to enter that profession? Sarcasm intended.  If a cop is wearing a camera will police selfies become popular? Do they turn it off for potty breaks and donuts stops? LOL  If they make everyone wear a body camera maybe crime will disappear? It seems discriminatory to single out police for them, why not people with criminal records too?  Too bad our politicians don't have to wear them, then we could see what really goes on in those meetings with lobbyists?"
909425,fishing n autograph,2015-04-11 18:09:00,2540,Several police services are doing pilot projects with them. I know Toronto and Calgary are trying them out. Several services already have dash cams
909430,Fisherman,2015-04-11 18:46:00,7201,"Ya, I can remember the guys using dash cams with mic packs about 12-14 years ago, read only, no way to delete anything."
909431,fishing n autograph,2015-04-11 18:51:00,2540,"It's been in the Us for years, only came to the gta two years ago or so"
909437,Canuck2fan,2015-04-11 19:30:00,1444,So what happens if an event occurs and the technology fails to work right? Either side will be screaming cover up...
909438,fishing n autograph,2015-04-11 19:31:00,2540,Yup welcome to the world of policing you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't. Either way if something happens every passer by will pull out their cell phone and start taping
909507,moxie,2015-04-12 01:35:00,1566,Its much tougher and dangerous being a cop in America where every citizen could be potentially concealing a weapon. Ten times the population at half the pay I'd say the men and women in the Blue Duds have a pretty nice gig in our neck of the woods  This camera could be more a hindrance to police due to the fact that if they choose to think instead of react instinctively it could be the last thought they have. With mounting anti police sentiment and civilian/police incidents this doesn't bode well for any of us.

909527,bigugli,2015-04-12 03:05:00,6138,"Body cams still won't provide all the answers.  They have a limited scope of vision, as do all lenses, cameras, of one type or other. They are just another tool which, depending on circumstance, will be either adequate or inadequate to the situation at hand. These are simple observations that are drawn from military and special police units that have been equipped with body and helmet cameras over the past 20 years."
909531,chris.brock,2015-04-12 03:43:00,4053,"With everybody having smart phones now, it's almost daily on the news there's a new video of cops shooting or beating somebody unjustly. The Cali horse thief most recently.   Being a police person is a tough job, but as a guy getting his news from the media, I think there's a real problem here.  edit- I think the body cams will be a waste of my tax dollars because the police won't release the incriminating  stuff because they protect their own"
909544,fishindevil,2015-04-12 08:56:00,6254,Well I hope the cops are forced to wear them !!! It will hopefully cut down on the unjust use of force and police brutality !!!! They have gotten away with way to much and since the use of cell phones it has proved it many many times !!! And they could also be used to justify the opposite if lethal force is needed the camera can justify it too !!! So it will work both ways ..... I'm all for it
909546,landry,2015-04-12 09:55:00,1005,Like any profession - most are awesome. A few are brutal. I feel sorry for the mostly dedicated and fair police officers out there now.
909555,outllaw,2015-04-12 11:19:00,1232,cameras cost 1500 per unit. police chief here stated on radio. cost factor millions for data storage. that a problem and also courts require transcrippts not video..
909579,fishing n autograph,2015-04-12 13:40:00,2540,Just like the media portrays the truth all the time. Media fans the flames all the time and sensationalized everything and always puts the negative slant on everything. Thousands of cops have positive interactions every day and not one word.
909580,fishing n autograph,2015-04-12 13:41:00,2540,Thank you I'm glad some people feel that way
909586,Big Cliff,2015-04-12 14:05:00,6899,"In 69 years I have never had a bad interaction with a cop, I treat them with respect, they treat me with respect. Doesn't mean I never got a ticket but when I did, it was because I deserved it!  I think the body cameras are going to be a good thing, it will stop a lot of idiots from screaming police brutality just because they can."
909590,Raf,2015-04-12 14:20:00,3495,"Ok, now back to the original topic, who makes these in case anyone is looking for an investment opportunity??"
909593,fishing n autograph,2015-04-12 14:23:00,2540,Lowest bidder will be hired by York lol
909604,dave524,2015-04-12 15:01:00,4508,"Why just cops?? what about teachers, health professionals, nursing home attendants, anyone who works with children, assembly line workers, once you start it's a slippery slope"
909608,farsider,2015-04-12 15:15:00,456,"Having cameras will help but, not all.  It will help a good cop in a ""justified"" use of force interaction.  You will need regulations/technology to make sure ""bad"" cops don't just turn them off willy-nilly whenever they please and also to make the video automatically uploaded elsewhere to prevent tampering.  Apparently it has contributed to a decrease in use of force incidents in jurisdictions that have started using them.  The cameras alone won't be enough without appropriate controls.  Cheers, Mark"
909610,Steve,2015-04-12 15:27:00,2075,"i'm glad the media is showing true video's...whether that be their own, or a by standards cell video.  we all just finished watching cops murdering, then planting evidence on a dead body (after hand cuffing the dead body), then having all the blue bloods lie on their reports to cover up for their fellow blue blood.  we didn't get video of Michael Browns murder....if we did, lots of protest would have been avoided, and Darren Wilson would be in jail.  cops and government place CCTV camera's all over the place, all in the name of public safety.  its time to start following the cops with cctv... all in the name of public safety.  how many times have we heard ""don't worry, if you don't have anything to hide, then you shouldn't worry about the cops....""  now we get to say the same thing to them.... ""don't worry mr copper, if you don't have anything to hide, you shouldn't have anything to worry about...""  irony at its finest.  Big Brother was once watching us.  Now Little Brother is watching everyone. And for that, I feel safer."
