727231,TennesseeGuy,2012-09-04 14:28:00,957,"Thanks for the great report Frankie.  It helped me realize how much I miss the area that I visited often from 1959-1970.  Meeting the Zimmerman family, fishing their lakes and seeing how much Chapleau has changed in the past 42 years is on my list."
727236,4x4bassin,2012-09-04 14:43:00,1025,"Great report and pictures , the smiles on eveyones faces says it all"
727245,fishnsled,2012-09-04 15:13:00,3520,"Looks like another fantastic trip Frank and Juli. A beautiful piece of heaven there, awesome pics."
727278,asdve23rveavwa,2012-09-04 17:13:00,2690," Thanks!  I was referring to a Timmies (Canada's most popular chain) lol  Thanks, Drew!   Great to hear!  I know we had smiles on for almost the whole time we were there!!   Yeah, the amount of repeat business they have is astounding.  No need to advertise for them.  The lake is fairly large (20 miles long) with lots of areas explore.  As you get to know it, patterns definitely become evident.  We caught fish in at least four new spots this year.    They are a classy family all the way.  Passionate about their lake!!     Thanks, guys!!!  Will, I think all of the north is a piece of heaven.  I'd be more than happy to spend my whole summer in that area."
727279,Spiel,2012-09-04 17:13:00,9065,"Wow!  You and Juli have posted some great reports here but this one will be tough to beat. As previously mentioned, outstanding!"
727377,FisherJuli,2012-09-04 23:21:00,125,"Sorry... Messed up! Did we mention that when there wasn't action on the water, there was action on land!!  "
727379,FisherJuli,2012-09-04 23:27:00,125,Am I the only one who think that these guys look like piranhas?!!! Good thing their warm-watered cousins haven't made it here to teach them any bad habits!!  
727486,asdve23rveavwa,2012-09-05 10:37:00,2690, Thanks for the kind words Chris!
727617,Joey,2012-09-05 23:16:00,9122,Don't think I've seen more smiles in a long time.   Great report and super pics.  Looks like some great fun
727754,limeyangler,2012-09-06 13:33:00,5204,What a cool report......some stunning pictures of family fun 
727952,asdve23rveavwa,2012-09-06 23:41:00,2690,"   Thanks Joey and Simon!  Once, again, glad you all enjoyed.  I'm already counting down to next year"
726889,asdve23rveavwa,2012-09-03 16:55:00,2690,"A year can feel like an eternity when you are waiting to return to a place that is special in your heart.  For me this place is Lake Windermere.  Last year in a thread titled ""My Dreams"" I (along with Juli's photos) told the story of our family camping vacation up at Happy Day in the Chapleau area of Ontario.  During the drive home we, as a family, decided to return in 2012.    I contacted Bob and Sondra a few days later and this time we booked a cabin. Thus began the long wait that finally came to an end as we began our journey north on Friday August 24th.   The lake is long with many bays and islands, and holds many deep holes.  Fishing pressure is limited to camp guests and a handful of private cottages.  I truly believe that many spots see virtually no fisherman throughout the season.  The fish may not be the largest in that area of the north, but, make no mistake about it there are walleye over 30"", pike over 40"" and bass over 20"" to be had. The Zimmerman family is working closely with the MNR and have instilled mandatory maximum ""keeper"" size for all three of these game fish.  By releasing ALL walleye over 18"", pike over 26"" and smallmouth bass over 15"" they hope to turn the lake into the true trophy producing water it has the potential to become.   Our trip began with a drive up to Tobermory and a journey across the waters of Georgian Bay aboard the Chi Cheemaun ferry.  A thrill for all five of us, as, Juli and I hadn't done it since childhood, and, the boys have never been on it. After a drive up Manitoulin island we stopped just north of Espanola for the night.               Since check in isn't until 3 PM on Saturday, we had a liesurely wake up with breakfast at Canada's most popular coffee shop. This was followed by another five hours, give or take, of driving.  We arrived at our home for the next six nights just prior to 3 PM.  The log cabin was beautiful, and, also is the only one in camp with a loft.  The loft turned into the boys personal space, they loved it!        We unloaded the truck, launched the boat, tied her up to our personal dock, and, fired up the bbq for some steak.  As usual everything tastes better in the north, and, those sirloins didn't disappoint!  After supper the boys went to hang out with Dylan (Bob's son that they had befriended the year prior) which gave Juli and I a chance to scoot out for a quick couple hours of fishing.       The next five and a half days were filled with relaxation, campfires, kayaking and, oh yeah, FISHING!!!!!!  As many of you already know Juli loves taking pictures as much (well nearly as much) as catching fish. Happy to say that the twins finally caught their first ever walleyes too!  What follows is a small sample of some of our photos taken during the week.                                                                                   Suffice to say that we are re-booked for next season, and, are once again looking forward to another week up in paradise.  Once again ""My Dreams"" have come true for a week.  Until next time I know they will again be filled with the song of the loon, the gentle lapping of waves, the rumble and whistle of the train that still travels past the camp and that tap-tap-tap of a hungry golden walleye.

726923,asdve23rveavwa,2012-09-03 19:21:00,2690,"   Thanks, Rob and Brad.  It was actually pretty much a week Brad, and, the memories are priceless   Our pleasure Paul.  It was tough picking only 50 pics out of around 900, plus, I didn't want to just post pic after pic of walleyes.   Terry, it was just what the doctor ordered.  We were overdue for a vacation.   Rick, buddy, the weather was tremendous again.  Just like last year we only had one rain that lasted about five hours.  Other than that we had a couple spits in the evening twice.  Campfires every night."
