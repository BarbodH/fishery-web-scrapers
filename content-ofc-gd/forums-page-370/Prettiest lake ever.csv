725008,ehg,2012-08-25 16:06:00,2666,"Yes, very beautiful lake with nice fish.  Wonder why that clearness is so rarely found?"
725015,kickingfrog,2012-08-25 16:36:00,8333,Lots of factors in water clarity.  Water/ground chemistry Lake bed material/ composition Inflows wave/wind/currents water temp  In general the clearer the lake is the less potential for food for fish.
725027,Spiel,2012-08-25 17:30:00,9065,Absolutely stunning Dan!  Glad to see you out and about and enjoying yourself.
725241,bucktail,2012-08-26 17:04:00,1857,Amazing Dan!!  Whats the bedrock consist of??  Darren
725331,danc,2012-08-27 01:12:00,4677,  I have no idea Darren.  And thanks everyone for the comments.
725454,ehg,2012-08-27 16:25:00,2666," Again, very beautiful water clarity on that lake DanC. Reminds me of Arctic Char lakes in Northern Quebec were there is no food except other chars.  Did find a lake similar called Hambone L. in Algonquin Park. It was a headwater at top of system;  beautiful similar water but no fish."
725503,Cookslav,2012-08-27 20:32:00,1457,"Awesome coloration....I've never seen a northern lake so blue! I know of a lake In Algonquin that is similarily ""green"" though...  Its clear down to an easy 20-30'....when the sun is shining its a bit more aqua/blue but on the Overcast days its Emerald green. I've been told there is a lot of Limestone in the lake and the cold springs in the lake keep it from getting much turbidity or algae. That combined with the shore being lined with several bogs...its naturally filtered clear. It is also high in elevation and has no Feeder creeks running in, only creeks running out through the bogs. I don't know this to be factualy correct as to why the lake is so clear and green...it just what I was told.  But she sure is purdy"
725626,Christopheraaron,2012-08-28 10:10:00,3525, I would for sure say limestone.
725650,Guidofisherman,2012-08-28 13:03:00,206,"Wow, Dan....that's fantastic. Unusual to see such blue water in our tea stained lakes. See you fishing. Alan"
725660,torco,2012-08-28 13:46:00,656,Wow hard to believe that is right here in Ontario. Somebody mentioned Hambone in Algonquin but this Lake X is on a whole other level. No wonder it is on your bucket list!
725680,4x4bassin,2012-08-28 16:04:00,1025,"Those are some real impressive pictures there Dan , I go to a lake like that in central Ontario for lakers but like Torco said this lake X is on a whole different level !"
726036,MJL,2012-08-30 00:54:00,2427,Incredible photos Dan
727402,solopaddler,2012-09-05 00:19:00,8605,"Just catching up on the reports now, was looking for this one. Glad it went well for you Dan, and you're right that lake is breathtaking! Carribean-esque"
727411,asdve23rveavwa,2012-09-05 00:43:00,2690,"I missed this one too, pristine water, and lakers.  Be-you-tee-full!!!"
727438,Moosebunk,2012-09-05 01:25:00,3970,Incredible!  Bucketlist material times two for sure Dan.
727626,bucktail,2012-09-05 23:33:00,1857,You guys have never been on Hamilton Harbour in August....makes that look like sewage!!!!!!
727632,Joey,2012-09-05 23:55:00,9122,"Wow Dan, reminds me of the lakes out Calgary and BC way.  Just beautiful"
727636,Whopper,2012-09-06 00:13:00,2174,Amazing Dan  Glad to hear you had a great time
727661,wantabigone,2012-09-06 01:13:00,97,Increadible water colour. What a gem
727730,BillM,2012-09-06 12:16:00,17367,"Dan, I think that's a lake I need to visit!!!  Photo-ops would be unreal with a polarized filter and a nice sunny day!"
727869,aplumma,2012-09-06 20:09:00,6896,Glad to see you can still find a place that beautiful Dan.   Art
727925,danc,2012-09-06 22:24:00,4677," I actually had a polarizer on for this shot Bill. Not a great shot with the boat in the foreground.    As much as I would have liked to take the time to set up for some better shots, time is of the essence when your handling an airplane, dragging a 16' boat out of the woods, putting the motor on it, setting up rods, etc. Especially if you're with a couple of non photographers. But I hear ya. I could go back to this lake with a camera only, and leave the fishing gear at home. Some day, maybe."
724908,danc,2012-08-24 22:45:00,4677,"About 10 years ago a friend flew me into a lake that left a huge impact on me. Not only was the fishing great, but the lake itself was a gem. Quite frankly, it was the most beautiful lake that I've ever seen. Turquoise blue green water made it seem like you were fishing in Hawaii. You could easily see bottom down 50 feet. In fact my buddy flew another friend into this lake a few years back and the depth finder was reading 45 feet. The friend informed him that his depth finder was not working. It's not 45 feet here. But indeed it was. Somehow this crystal clear water made 50 feet look like 20. It's been on my bucket list to get back there ever since. Last weekend I got to cross that return adventure off of my list.   A short 8 mile ride from our camp site to the lake with another buddy flying solo off of our wing.    Our approach gave me this awesome view of paradise.    Heading out fishing. The green water in this shot is probably 30 to 40 feet deep. The trees at the far end are the length of the lake. Barely enough room to take off with the plane. My pilot buddies were concerned about getting off of the lake with the wind direction.    All you have to do to catch fish here is drop any kind of lure to the bottom. Within a few minutes you'll have a Lake Trout on. Most fish are on the small side. 2 to 3 lbs. But occasionally you'll latch on to a cannibal. That's a fish that gets big enough to feed on it's own kind and can grow to monsterous proportions. Our biggest fish this trip was about 12 lbs. And I had a fish on that I couldn't budge off of the bottom before it spit my barbless hook. My last time here we caught a couple of mid to high teen weight fish.      I love this lake so much that I just might put it back on my bucket list."
724910,kickingfrog,2012-08-24 22:50:00,8333,That is a very pretty lake. Nice fish too.
724911,Roy,2012-08-24 22:51:00,13728,"Wow! Looks like heaven to me, Dan. Great pics too!"
724912,Live2fish85,2012-08-24 22:51:00,1633,That really is a beautiful lake. The water looks amazing.
724913,irishfield,2012-08-24 22:53:00,26272,"Very reminding of my ""laker lake"" in Temagami with similar sea like colours! Thanks for the porn Dan !"
724914,mercman,2012-08-24 22:53:00,7054,It sure is a Gem Dan.Looks completely pristeen. Yer a lucky man my friend.
724916,manitoubass2,2012-08-24 22:56:00,11391,"I had the same experience on that lake as a teen (might not be the same lake you are referring to but it looks one in the same).  Me and two buddies visited the lake for the first time to hang out and have beers with a few girlfriends. When we arrived, we were shocked at the view right on the lake! Wow! We quickly got the swim trunks on and walked to the end of the dock. There was a diving board? I thought, what the hell? I asked her ""why is there a diving board? It's like 6 FOW off the end of the dock?"" She laughed. ""Go ahead, pin dive and touch bottom"". I obliged. I resurfaced defeated, lol. We later trolled through what was indeed, 22 FOW.  Fishing was incredible, but snorkeling was a def. highlight of the trip"
724920,misfish,2012-08-24 23:09:00,29133,"OMG Thats a great shot Dan.    What a beautiful place. Yes,it looks like   Hawaii. AMAZING   Thats a JEWL."
724925,Whitespinnerbait,2012-08-24 23:45:00,2038,"Been there, done that !!  "
724926,Jigger,2012-08-24 23:53:00,1237,That may be one of the best release shots ive laid my eyes on! Awesome looking lake youve found Dan. Gem seems like a very fair word. Tres cool
724928,spincast,2012-08-25 00:09:00,3279,That is one beaut lake  and 1 beaut laker. Love the shot of the plane off the wing
724931,Rich,2012-08-25 00:38:00,3927,Simply awesome.  Thank you very much for sharing your experience. I believe i'd have the same opinion were i to ever visit that lake.
724935,misfish,2012-08-25 00:57:00,29133,"I meant to add Dan,,,,,,,,,,,,That water looks like Mountain Dew,,,,,,,,   Still cant get over the beauty of the water."
724936,danc,2012-08-25 01:01:00,4677, It's a rare gem for sure Brian. My pilot buddy has flown from coast to coast many times and he says that he's never seen a lake quite like this one.
724938,Rattletrap2,2012-08-25 01:06:00,1652,"Gorgeous water Dan! I have always wanted to fish for trout in a lake, but this type of water makes it all the more special. I never even knew we had water in Ontario like that, especially so far North. I guess I always just thought most of the Northern lakes were more tanic coloured."
724942,TennesseeGuy,2012-08-25 02:09:00,957,Thanks for sharing.  You surely picked the right day to take pictures.  Beauties.
724944,rufus,2012-08-25 02:19:00,267,Absolutely Gorgeous!
724953,adempsey,2012-08-25 04:47:00,1498,Definitely a beautiful lake!!  Thanks for sharing the photos.
724973,fishin' magician,2012-08-25 13:02:00,10,Whats the name of the lake???
724975,lhousesoccer,2012-08-25 13:20:00,442,"I was wondering how long it would take for someone to ask that question!!!  I'm pretty sure it won't be answered!  If you have a place like that, you generally keep it to yourself!    None of this  It sure does look magical though!"
724977,kickingfrog,2012-08-25 13:44:00,8333,Lake X.  Although the need for a float plane ride would preclude many from accessing it.
724980,limeyangler,2012-08-25 13:49:00,5204,I am speechless....looks like the Caribbean with pine trees!  Stunning setting to catch fish.....thanks for sharing Dan.
724982,NAW,2012-08-25 13:54:00,4022,Very nice indeed!  Thanks for sharing
725002,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-08-25 15:41:00,535,"The last lake I fished had areas where you could literally only see 6 inches down. Gorgeous pictures, great release shot!"
725005,Leecher,2012-08-25 15:50:00,7832,"Absolutely beautiful pristine waters  I was sure you were going to post, oversize healthy speckle trout... but lakers will do    Nice release shot Dan Thanks for sharing Jacques"
