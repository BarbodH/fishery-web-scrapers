A couple of days ago it was a lone bear pratically in the middle of town. Until recently, the cops have been shooting and killing the bears, but the last two occourances have been handled by the MNR, who tranquilize and relocate them. Glad to see the MNR stepping in finally."
727933,Parisite,2012-09-06 22:43:00,66,"How can the media state two black bears sighted in the headline and then follow up with the details of the story that prove their headline wrong? Each sighting was 2 hours apart and a mile away from each other. Makes more sense that it was one bear seen in two different locations.  Sorry, tired of sensationalism in news reporting.  Be responsible and tell it like it is."
727955,OhioFisherman,2012-09-06 23:53:00,6623," LOL, first you have to understand how unusual it is to see one in the Cleveland area. I have never seen one except in news reports in recent years. All have been in sightings in eastern suburbs, which more or less give credence to the idea that they wander here from Pennsylvania.  Ya almost a sure thing it is the same bear, reporters in the area get excited when one is spotted, and some dummy will probably get the darn thing shot trying to pet it or feed it. People here really don`t have a clue."
