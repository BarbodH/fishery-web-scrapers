We're going to temiscaming , and I wanted to know if there are any good day trips to make from there if we don't do so well on the big lake. I've only been there once and it was a family trip not a fishin one . We are staying just outside the town of temiscaming . We have a 18.5 ft bowrider with a 115 . Wally's are the main goal but other game fish in good numbers would be ok too.   Any tips for temiscaming welcome aswell .  Thanks"

U should have no problem with walleye (even blue ones!!!) on the big lake.  Fished it a few times and have t had a bad day out there. Bill
