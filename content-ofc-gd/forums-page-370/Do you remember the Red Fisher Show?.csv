666311,16 Footer,2012-02-14 12:08:00,191,Caster  Thanks for the back ground info on Red. He must have been doing something right to live to 92!
666312,Billy Bob,2012-02-14 12:18:00,5865," Yep.....he was ""Pickled"" to last longer....LOL...  Rest in Peace Red......"
666320,Dave Bailey,2012-02-14 12:56:00,1641,"Dad and I used to watch it regularly, and always thinking of the Big One we would get on our next outing."
666329,Harrison,2012-02-14 13:34:00,2202,"I remember my dad watching it when I was really young.  Pretty sure I recall something about a Moose Hoof ash tray, was there one?"
666333,Headhunter,2012-02-14 13:46:00,5703,"Still, my favorite fishing show! I met Red at the London Fishing Show in the late 70's. He was tucked away in a motor home, signing autographs. He a copy of his book of poemsfor me and my buddys.. We did notice that there was a distinct ""aroma"" inside the camper... if you know what I mean! While we were there Red suggested that we check out a certain retailer who was selling tackle at a very fair price. He showed us a floating lure that he bought from the guy, it was called a Spinididdy... basically a larger version of the Tiny Torpedo, dressed in frog colours. My buddies and I raced over to buy as many as we could afford. Heck, if Red told us to buy it, there was no chance that we were going to let that tackle tip get by us... I still have the lure and yes, I have caught quite a few fish on it! We spoke to him for what seemed like hours... gotta love that guy!  I would really like it if they could find a way to capture the sound tracks of Red's fishing adventures. If you recall, there was no sound taken during his fishing with guests, just their commentary while watching the show with Red in the studio. Man, I can only immagine the colourful language and jokes that had to be flying, during their filming. Might not make it to long on regular TV.LOL If there was a fishing show like that on TV today, I'd watch that! HH"
666335,Ralph Field,2012-02-14 14:09:00,1018, I am an old fart and feeling even older.
666337,superdad,2012-02-14 14:15:00,353,"Red was in Kingston in 2002 to speak to a conservation group and was travelling home on the train when I worked at the VIA station, I sped home and got my camera and had a collegue take a picture outside for my fishing wall.  I am proud to say that he autographed his book for me that day also.    Cheers - we miss the old guy with his quirky habits, but it was a fishing show we mever missed.  David  aka  Superdad"
666345,pikehunter,2012-02-14 14:49:00,1659,I didn't know he was an American! Maybe that explains all the skuttlebutt eh?  Always watched his show.
666410,Jds63,2012-02-14 18:17:00,1365,"fond memories watching the Red Fisher Show, that along with my Dad, was the start of my passion for fishing ...  one more show was the American Sportsmen , with Curt Gowdy I believe ..."
666418,Spiel,2012-02-14 18:46:00,9065,"Of course I remember it, used to watch it with my Grandfather every Sunday, couldn't stand it even as a child."
666428,fishnsled,2012-02-14 19:09:00,3520,"Loved watching his show, one of the reasons I got into fishing, My Dad and Red Fisher. In college we did a spoof on his show that ran every week on CCTV in the college. Lots of fun sitting around ""Scuttlebutt Lodge"" but the field trips to blow things up with a shot gun went over the best.  I'd love to hear the sound track as well Joe! LOL!"
666431,Cast-Away,2012-02-14 19:15:00,790,"One of my roommates was nicknamed Red for obvious reasons so when we were our fishing and he caught a fish we would say that we were on the Red Fisher show! At the end of the day my other buddy would say, ""okay guys, let's head back to Scuttleslut lodge for a few""! We would say, ""a few what?"""

666476,rufus,2012-02-14 22:09:00,267,I always watched Red Fisher as a kid as well. I thought that it was great his guests who were athletes and other people that I admired loved to fish just like me! Fishing shows nowadays don't have such guests. Maybe the lodge owner who is giving them free accommodations but that is about it...
666700,blue pickeral,2012-02-15 15:43:00,267,"John Candy, when performing on the SCTV comedy show did a very good parody. Jimmy Buffet, the musician, was visiting at Scuttlebutt Lodge. The two went fishing from a hot air balloon. Candy's dialogue "" we're up over Lake Whatever, using a purple jig on about 5 miles of line....."""
666845,Bob,2012-02-15 23:22:00,370,"Yeah, I remember. My brother bought a crew-cab Volkswagen pick-up that had been used on the show to film an episode that was a moose hunt. Can't remember the name of the celebrity he had on that time but I believe he was a baseball player."
727682,R. J. Kovacs,2012-09-06 02:09:00,12,"  A float plane landed on the bay our cottage is located along last week.  It circled overhead a few times then touched the water.  It reminded me of the opening credits fof the Red Fisher Show.  It docked a few lots down.  Brought back memories of the show, and really gave our place a remote feeling."
727721,mercman,2012-09-06 11:38:00,7054,  Welcome to the Group Mr Kovacs
727725,NAC,2012-09-06 11:53:00,369,Remember it well and always enjoyed it. Always assumed Scuttlebutt was on some private remote lake but was actually informed it was the back of bush lot near Chatam.  Guess that explain Fergie's involvement.
727748,woodenboater,2012-09-06 13:26:00,2277,"Yup, next to Foster Hewitt calling hockey, this was one of my favorite shows. Whoever owns the rights should get it back on the air, I predict it would wipe the other shows off the sked"
727759,The JAY,2012-09-06 14:25:00,239,"Oh man... I loved that show. I started working Saturdays in '80 or '81, but until then I watched faithfully. As a city kid it blew me away to see WHERE these guys fished. I didn't know places like that existed at the time. When I did my first fly-in a few years ago it brought all the memories flooding back as I watched the plane come in for the first time to pick us up. I still get goose bumps standing on a dock way-the-hell up North watching the plane come in...."
666178,16 Footer,2012-02-13 22:30:00,191,"I remember watching the Red Fisher show as a kid and think this was the first fishing show on TV in Canada. If I remember right it was a half hour show with video of Red fishing in an open boat then a shore lunch and then his show finished with a ""lodge"" chat. I dont think Red threw all of his catch back like they do in today's shows. Does anybody know what happened to Red?"

666183,desship,2012-02-13 22:43:00,96,"Bernard Herbert ""Red"" Fisher (18 February 1914 â€“ 5 May 2006)[1] was an American sporting goods retailer, U.S. naval and United States Coast Guard officer, newspaper columnist, and poet. He later became a popular radio and television personality in Canada. He is not to be confused with Montreal Gazette sports columnist, Red Fisher.  Fisher was inducted into the U.S. based ""Fishing Hall Of Fame"" in 1948. When he moved to Canada, he launched a popular radio talk show program The Red Fisher Show in 1963, which moved to television in 1968. The TV version was set at fictitious ""Scuttlebutt Lodge"" and featured silent home movies of outdoors activities, often fishing, which involved high profile guests, mainly from the major league sports of the era. These included ice hockey stars Gordie Howe, Eddie Shack, and Johnny Bower, and baseball legends Ted Williams, Roger Maris and Ferguson Jenkins. The Red Fisher Show differed from other outdoor living shows of its time by promoting nature conservation, game preservation and the ""catch and release"" mentality. The series continued until 1989, making it among the longest-running on CTV.  At the same time, his weekly column, Outdoor Topics, was read in over 180 newspapers. In 1971, Fisher's first book of poems, Poems Of Our Great Outdoors, was published and distributed. Red would famously give each guest on his show a copy of these poems. Three volumes of Poems Of Our Great Outdoors were released, each one simply adding more poems to the previous collection. Red released a record on Saga Records also called Poems of Our Great Outdoors in which he read his poems to a symphonic background.  In 2000, Red Fisher released a collection of stories and anecdotes from his life called Tight Lines and Tall Tales. A portion of the profits were donated to outdoor conservation efforts.  Fisher died in Chatham, Ontario at the age of 92. Red fisher is credited for introducing the open-faced spinning reel to North America and, as a result, was inducted into the Fishing Hall of Fame"
666190,DRIFTER_016,2012-02-13 22:56:00,10439,He is the reason I fish and the reason I ended up guiding on Great Bear Lake and probably the reason I now live in the NWT. Never missed a show growing up. Wish I could get all his shows on DVD. He had great guests and went to some great places and told a great story.
666201,earl,2012-02-13 23:11:00,14,"Getting up early saturday morning to watch Red Fisher was the best......always good for a laugh especially when he went Bone fishing, when he caught one he would look at his guest and tell them he has a Bone On..................his spirit will live forever"
666202,Billy Bob,2012-02-13 23:12:00,5865,I got a kick out of how after having a shore lunch he would hide behind some bushes and watch the gulls come in to clean up anything left out...  Red Fisher liked his oil.....on one of the last shows he showed everyone why he always has a pair of binocular with him....the eye piece unscrewed and he then drank from it....
666204,bushart,2012-02-13 23:19:00,2628,Think they called him the father of spinning reels--intro wise  Remember him tellin his doctor story--when the doc told him to quit drinkin----the doctor put a worm in a glass of whiskey and how the worm died--to show results.....Fisher picks out the worm----downs the whiskey and says...I'll never die of worms
666209,SirCranksalot,2012-02-13 23:26:00,3291,Red Green's 'lodge' segment was based on Red Fisher's show. R. Green one said that R. Fisher operated on the premise that nothing he could say would ever bore you.

I remember, some decades back, the cabin being set up at the sportsman show, and waiting patiently to see the man in person."
666221,wormdunker,2012-02-14 00:12:00,1711,"Yes, I remember watching his show as a child with my father.  Just to explain how long ago that was, we had a black & white TV, probably a ""large"" 12"" screen, maybe 3 channels & U had to get out of your chair to change channels.  Oh yah & my father drove a 1956 Buick Special.  That was a tank!!"
666224,vinnimon,2012-02-14 00:26:00,2593," X2 We both had our eyes glued to that black and white, and when my little brother tried to change the channel, look out We never had a buick but a 1966 2 door impala, sky blue.  "
666225,Ralph Field,2012-02-14 00:29:00,1018,I watched every fishing show on television and enjoyed them all. I remember watching the King White fishing show that followed Hockey Night in Canada long before the Red Fisher Show was on television.
666231,docknocker,2012-02-14 00:46:00,36,"  I had the Honor of meeting him and shaking his hand several times While working/volounteering for the OFAH in the '80's We were right across from him at the Sportsman show.(he remembered my name) maybe because it was on my shirt... ? It was the thrill of my life! Glad I finally found an audience to tell this story to, Because the ""Kids"" at work just look at me like I'm from another planet. I think I'll go look for my Binoculars now,,, Might be something left,,, Oh, Yes I still have my Zebco Cardinal 4 'Cause Red said they were the best!"
666235,Mike Pike,2012-02-14 01:05:00,1332,"I too was a huge fan of his show as a kid.  Hard to think of it now-a-days but it was the only all fishing show on tv and, therefore, the only show like it.  Watching it on my parents' snowy old black and white television, I hung on every word Red said and every fish he caught, hoping that some day I would catch fish just like Red.  Ooops, got caught showng my age!  lol"
666242,ketchenany,2012-02-14 01:24:00,3229," We sure are! Gadabout Gadis the fly fisherman was an earlier show and got me interested and then came ""Red"" with fish and  'moose milk' ! a TV special was done on him and his guests a few years back.   maybe it's the reason why we are all here, and love the sport whether we practice it now or not for different reasons."
666250,bigugli,2012-02-14 01:54:00,6138,"At least it was a ""fishing show"". Not like today's 30 minute commercials."
666257,manitoubass2,2012-02-14 02:15:00,11391,"Hands down, the best part of his show was that he wasn't pretending to be someone he wasn't.  Of course, I didn't realize that when I was younger, and just thought he was some crazy entertaining dude.  In retrospect, this is exactly what I would love to see in a fishing show...  Too bad though, be tough to follow up that personality"
666261,ketchenany,2012-02-14 02:25:00,3229," How true BIG. I watch the occasional one and last Saturday while having a coffee every fish he hooked (not naming anyone) but it  was the brand of hook, line and down rigger to net it. If the lake paid the bills he would have  mentioned it but the  background gave it away!  Being in marketing, I cannot understand why they have a fishing show when MOST are out on the water at that time! That part really kills me and would like to know why you have show when the audience is out fishing?  I'm ready can you get the glove on! Best line ever!"

I met Red a few times thru out the early 90's when i was delivering  loads of wood stoves for Napoleon to Mason Place in Keswick . Back then if you remember he was doing the commercials for them . I would always look forward to delivering there and running into  him , like most here i grew up watching him on tv as well . When Red was'nt in front of the camera he would always come over and say Hi when i was there , i considered my self lucky to have had a few good chats with Red weather they  were about the product i was delivering or which epasode of his fishing i liked the best . So ya i remember The Red Fisher Show and lucky to have gotten to know the man a bit behind the seens ."
