Done get me wrong, they are actually really nice rods for $70...when they aren't broken! I broke two this year! Got one replace under warranty and then went with a Quantum Resource (same price).  If you don't mind shelling out a few bucks, I cant say enough good things about Kistler rods!"

Excellent rods for the price. I have two of them, and I fish Bass tournaments again next year, I'll likely be selling off my shimano stuff in the spring. I also have a nice G.Loomis but its balance just feels a bit off for my liking.  Since I don't know the price of the spiel rod you bought, but it sounds like its a fair bit more than a premier(not a high end rod by any means) Its really hard to compare the two. I have a cumar that blows the Gloomis and the premier out of the water in terms of weight and sensitivty, however since I bring at least a dozen rods with me every time I go fishing, cost is a factor. I can't and wouldn't compare a Cumara to a Premier, no more than I would compare a Convergence to an Avid.  I would say that in the 95-120 dollar price range a St.Croix Premier is one the best out there. If I was going over 200(and I have several that are), so far for me the cumare is the most sensitive hands down."

727699,Skipper D,2012-09-06 02:58:00,1970,lol ... i think  the real moral of the story here is ..... we don't mess with old people ........
727701,wall i,2012-09-06 03:37:00,48," Yes and no... performance wise the difference between the premier line ( 3 year warranty) and Avid lineup is not discernable day to day. For the lifetime warranty you are paying a premium in cost. Personally, I have never broken a rod in my 50 years of fishing .....I treat them well. However, I have had rods broken....son Alex guilty on multiple accounts. I made the mistake...especially before coffee in the morn of saying....yeah take the friggin thing out to the shore and cast....thinking I can gulp some caffeine and come to life in peace b4 he gets back...well aint been that way. Comes back in more pieces than it left in...snags....pike reeled in to the snap lock.....blah......blah.   Point is, unless your son is named ALEX, and if you havent gotten onto care of your rod thing (case it up) then pay for the warranty coverage.  As for me the Premier line is fine. The companies have built the cost of insurance into lifetime warranty..  they do the math ...do you? 	They know that after the 1st breakeage most are too embarrassed to submit again. In essense, you paid for the replacement of the rod upfront..My point..if you  take care of your rods dont pay a premium for the lifetime insurance as performance differential is not there. The jump in performance is from $50 to say $120......beyond that...your paying insurance up front.  Ok   goodnight I hear Ruth whining."
727724,BillM,2012-09-06 11:47:00,17367," There's a big difference between an Avid and the Premier lines... I suggest you pick one up and fish it...    I snapped an Avid last year while fishing plastics for big pike in the spring, broke about 5 inches above the handle (Gave me a nice bloody lip at the same time).. Packed it up, shipped it to St.Croix and I had a new rod inside of 3 weeks.  Why would I buy anything else with service like that?  You're also making quite a big assumption that because someone broke their rod, they must not be takimng care of it, or lack some sort of maturity.....  I'll cut you some slack though, old timers rarely ever change their minds  I'll also send this rod back if it breaks again, what's there to be embarrassed about?  'Sorry St.Croix, I snapped my rod in a big snake, please don't laugh at me'...  LOL!!!"

717712,jigsnreels,2012-07-25 12:44:00,133," I'm an Ugly Stik devotee.  Mainly because I just can't afford the top-of-the-line stuff.  But also, since I got my first one over fifteen years ago, I have never had one fail on me - not once.  I currently own two, a 7' ML spinning rod for general fishing and an 8'6"" salmon rod that I have yet to use in Ontario (bought it when I was in BC and Alaska).  I've had big salmon nearly tie a knot in the latter one but so far, nothing has managed to damage it in the slightest.  IMO, you can't beat these rods for the price, and even if the unthinkable happens and one does break, you're not out a lot of money and it's easily replaced.  So far though, I haven't had to replace one yet (other than my first one, which was stolen, and is probably still being used by someone somewhere)."

717729,Lip-ripper,2012-07-25 14:29:00,228," I have one of these also, I like it alot."
717732,adolson,2012-07-25 14:55:00,783,"   I'm with you.  Sadly, I used to think Ugly Stiks were good, but only because I was ignorant and inexperienced. That changed when I got a Voltaeus. That really is a pretty good rod. WAY more sensitive, I can cast further with a shorter rod, and pretty hardy. If you don't want to spend your full budget on a rod, and want one that is built specifically to be durable, my vote is for the Voltaeus. I've used my 6'6"" MH for everything from 8.5"" brook trout, up through bass and walleye, up to my 34"" pike and it's been good all around. It's still a little heavy, but nowhere near as bad as my Ugly Stik was.  Even my cheap 5' UL Shimano Sojurns are pretty good, considering the $20 price tag. I've caught brookies up to 16"" on them and I have no complaints. I have no idea about durability though. That's why I got two. And for my birthday this year I picked up a 6' ML Bob Izumi rod which I intend to use for trout and walleye. I haven't used it enough yet to say how much I like it, but it looked quite nice, I like the split cork handle, and I had read pretty favorable reviews of it.  I don't think you need to spend hundreds of dollars on a rod to catch a fish, but if I were going high-end, I'd look at G Loomis and St. Croix, though I suspect I'd still walk away with a Shimano. I just have nothing bad to say about them. Yet. I don't see myself ever going with such a crazy expensive rod though, just because no matter how careful I am, accidents happen and I'd be crushed to lose such a pricey rod. And it always seems the more pricey something is, the more chance there is I'll make a mistake and break it.  Edit:  THIS! But I'd be afraid to use it.. Very pretty work that would probably go on my wall instead of in my boat."
717735,Spiel,2012-07-25 15:09:00,9065,"   Thanks for the nod guys.  Building on a Rainshadow RX7 (7') with custom cork grip and Fuji components I could likely bring it in for $200.00 to $225.00.  If that's of any interest to you HFP, shoot me a PM."
717755,ckrb2007,2012-07-25 16:37:00,449,"I've used Ugly Stix and other lower priced rods all through my childhood and early teens and caught boat loads of fish on them. But I didn't know any different back then. The technique specific rods these days are awesome but I till believe that there's no need to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on a rod. I'm a middle of the road kinda guy when it comes to buying gear. I take 6 rods out with me on the boat when I fish.  1 - 7' verdict w/Abu Revo STX 2 - 6'9"" Diawa Ballistic w/quantum pt energy burner 3 - 7' 2"" Crucial w/quantum smoke 150 (my most expensive combo at around $400....Fathers day gift) 4 - 7' St. Croix eyecon w/shimano sahara 5 - 7' BP Carbonlite w/quantum pt energy burner 6 - 6' 6"" Rapala TS2 w/quantum enery pti 20  This is all I need. I've got 6lb largies out of the slop, 15lbs 'ski from the skinny water, walters, crappie, whitefish, lakers on these combos. What i'm trying to say is that you dont need to spend $400 on just a rod. If I was to recommend one rod in the price range that you have it would probably be the Crucial. I'm also very happy with the Diawa Ballistic ($100) as well. Both of these rods can be found at Cdn Tire now. If anything, spend the $$$ on a good reel. 75% of my reels were found on Kijiji. There are some great deals to be found there.  Cheers and good luck. Colin  ...and by the way, I'd also be scared to use one of Spiel creations!! They look like awesome works of art!!!!"

725826,hungryforpike,2012-08-29 04:25:00,46,"Well, I said I would post some pics and feedback after some solid use of my newly acquired Spiel rod. So here it is..    I mentioned previously..while I was waiting for the Spiel rod, I bought a St. Croix Premier. During the time between that purchase and the completion of my custom rod I fished quite a bit and simply fell in love with the St. Croix, light, super sensitive..does everything well, best rod I had ever used.  Until my Spiel rod showed up. I would not consider myself an easy customer to please from an expectations prespective, so when people mentioned the insanely high quality of his product numerous times and I heard all these promises about performance, I took it with a large grain of salt.. I was just not sure it would be that much better than the St. Croix.  I spent 13 straight hours on the boat saturday fishing pike and bass using every manner of bait and lures with my new custom rod and I will simply NEVER buy a pre-built rod again. The Spiel custom rod changes everything. All the esthetics aside, this rod is considerably lighter..easily 25% than the st. Croix, it is easily twice as sensitive..I can feel every paddle tail flip and jig tail swirl, every weed my lures bump and casts waaaaay nicer. Your hands and wrist never get tired..I could have fished another 3 hours easily. It takes fishing to whole new level. I had my premier with me on another pfluger reel, as I usually bring two rods fishing, by the end of the day I was not even bothering to use it. This rod makes my St. Croix feel like I am fishing with an Ugly stick. I have several more large days of fishing coming up.. so if anything changes I will be sure to report it back here. My advice to anyone with a new rod in mind is spend the extra money and get the quality piece from Spiel..worth every penny.   HFP  "

717630,hungryforpike,2012-07-25 00:33:00,46,"greetings everyone.. here is my rotten story.   Big group of people up at the cottage this weekend, out fishing with the guys with my nearly brand new(2 months old) Abu Garcia Veritas mated to my brand new pfluger patriarch, running 20lb suffix braided line. I am dragging a popper over the surface, give it a pop and boom.. rod snaps into 3 piece less than 2 ft from the end of the rod. So I do a little googling, and it turns out..hundreds of people are breaking the veritas, and the rod a level above it the verdict. My buddy just bought a rapala shift that I was considering and I am reading these are breaking like crazy too??? what the hell? In all my years of fishing with cheap gear..I have never broken a rod, the year I upgrade..issues. That being said.. I will never go back to that heavy unpleasant cheap gear, I would really like a higher end rod.  So, my questions becomes.. who makes a higher end, quality rod in the $100-$200 range that is going to be super sensitive like the Veritas which I loved, but super durable at the same time? And it has to be 2 pc, I fish everything with one setup. Mainly pike and bass. Thanks guys,   HFP"

717637,GBW,2012-07-25 01:06:00,8460,Why not a BPS brand as the warranty is good.  Same with Shimano!  The better Shimano rod's have an over the counter warranty.  Just keep the bill of sale safe.
717638,Canuck2fan,2012-07-25 01:08:00,1444,"No warranty on the rod since you broke it fishing?  I don't go with one rod for all types of fishing. I have been equally impressed by some of the new cheaper rods ie Shakespeare Catera/Agility series as I have been by the more expensive Shimano Compre. For double the price I don't see the Compre offering double the value in any way ie feel, strengh and more importantly sensitivity.  I know what you mean about going back to heavy older rods though. I just bought a Cabelas Whupping stick for 29.99 the thing is so strong and sensitive but it just weighs a ton compared to IM-8 rods. The 10ft whupping stick weighs 2.5ozs more than the 11.5ft Catera and 4oz's more than a Swan Company IM-8 11.5ft. Those ozs sound like nothing on paper but in your hand with the same reel it makes such a difference. Over the day casting at minimum a couple hundred times it takes a toll."

Either warranty is over the counter or it isn't. LOL.  It really comes to down how a rod feels with the reel you want to use on it, and how the store you bought it at handles things that go wrong. NOBODY wants to have to deal with the manufacturer for a replacement."
717661,adempsey,2012-07-25 02:05:00,1498,"I broke a St.Croix Premier rod last year, but I know I slightly damaged it a few months before and I broke it trying to get out of a snag.   I still bought another one as I do like them.  My father broke a Shimano Clarus a couple years ago when the fish suddenly took off under the boat and the rod hit the side of the boat and snapped.  Basically, all graphite rods are fragile no matter what price range they fall in.  Bang them around enough and I have a feeling they will start to get weak points.  I have also been using a Browning Medallion GT rod for over five years and really like it.   So, I'd also consider getting one of the BPS brands (I think Browning is a BPS brand???) since they seem easiest to replace if something happens.  My favorite rod though is a GLoomis Walleye rod that I picked up earlier in the year on clearance.   What a nice rod, although it's a 1 piece.  I never thought I would feel a difference between it and my St.Croix rods, but after using it for the majority of time on my last trip and then switching back to one of my St.Croix set-ups they felt ""clunky"" and heavy.   Definitely not what I expected."

717668,hungryforpike,2012-07-25 02:45:00,46,have a read online.. they seem to be snapping an awful lot also. Abu gets no more of my money.    
717669,hungryforpike,2012-07-25 02:46:00,46,there is the lesson.. should be shopping at Sail I guess. you had the same rods and they both broke I assume?  
717673,Dabluz,2012-07-25 02:56:00,701," I broke a rod once....about 50 years ago.  I broke another one about 3 years ago but I had lent it to a person who had never fished before and I'm quite sure he hit the gunwale of the boat with it.  Anyway....it was a good rod and cost me a big 10 dollars....on sale at Walmart's.  I still have a few more of those rods made by Renegade and they are doing fine after more than 10 years.  I also broke a rod by leaving it in the sun in a car and it warped.  I tried to straighten the warp and broke it.  I sent it back to Berkley and they sent me a new one.  It did not have a lifetime garantee but was replaced anyway.  I don't believe in rods having a lifetime garantee.  You pay for the garantee or you buy a rod made in Korea from a company that makes the same rod as the one that has a lifetime garantee.  All rods break if they are improperly handled or the fisherman wants to pull fish out of the water like the pros do.  No ordinary rod can lift a 10 lb bag of potatoes off the ground without breaking so don't expect the rod to pull 30 lbs.  A fish can pull about 4 times it's weight.  Luckily, todays reels have great drags when compared to the reels made in the 40's and 50's so use the drag on the reel to protect your rod."
717677,ckrb2007,2012-07-25 03:08:00,449,I've been using an Abu Verdict for 2 yrs now without any problems...in fact it's one of my fav. rods to use for flippin and pitching in the milfoil patches. What about the new Rapala Concept? I heard they're pretty sweet but I'm not sure of the price.
717680,eman,2012-07-25 03:21:00,101,"I use a 6'-6"" ugly stick medium, that cost about 50 bucks for a ton of bass and pike fishing. This is my hard to get places rod (trekking through bush, mountain biking in, or just tossing a rod around camping). They're so flexible, hard to break, cheap and have a 5 year warranty. My uncle who taught me to fish as a kid used so i'm slightly impartial. You can go light cause of the soft tip, or fish the weeds with braid as I'm not concerned about breaking. Had to swap it out at a dealer in Orillia 3 years ago cause the cork on the handle broke and no hassles. Great bank for the buck!"
717682,rufus,2012-07-25 03:28:00,267,I recently had a brand new St. Croix rod snap hoisting a 1 lb bass into the boat. People say you shouldn't hoist fish in with graphite and it was my fault. I have another St. Croix that I can hoist walleye into the boat all day long with and it hasn't broken in the past year I have been using it (yet!).  I replaced the broken rod with a cheap Shakespeare Ugly Stick as I have been getting tired forking out $$ for graphite and it sure felt heavy to begin with. Used to it now though.
717683,hungryforpike,2012-07-25 03:43:00,46,"it is funny you both mention the ugly stick.. that has been the rod i was using up until I upgraded, thing is indestructible it seems...had it for years and only in the early days it was often mistreated. However, after you use a nice rod, impossible to go back..way to heavy and just not sensitive at all. Not to say I will ever throw it away.      "
717686,Live2fish85,2012-07-25 05:09:00,1633, I love St. Croix as they make great rods. I bought a Shimano Compre thos year which I don't like a hole lot. I then decided to try a Shimano Crucial and I love it. It isn't there best rod or anything but a great rod for $160 and lifetime warranty over the counter if theres one in stock. I think I like it more then my St. Croix to be honest. My next will be the Shimano Cumara for a crankbait rod.  Look at Shimano as well as they have a better warranty.
717690,Whitespinnerbait,2012-07-25 09:19:00,2038,"St Croix.......MOJO RODS   :worthy:    Great Rod, for a Great Price !!"
717711,backbay,2012-07-25 12:43:00,773,"You have the luxury of a number of choices. I will vouch for Abu rods, at least the Veritas. I have a 7ft mh and it usually has a Super Shad Rap on it, which is heavier than the rating for the rod, and it's held up well. I also have a 6'6 Rapala R-type in a two price that has served me very well. The most irritating thing about two price rods to me is when they twist in the ferrule. The R-type doesn't. My Abu is a one piece, but I believe it's available in a two price. Happy Shopping!"
