727520,mercman,2012-09-05 14:55:00,7054,"Besides the possible harm to the fish, the biggest problem with useing inappropriate equipment is the wear and tear factor.Most bass/walleye combos dont have the HD gears and Drag components found in big game setups.With the lighter combos, you run the risk of haveing you gear destroyed if you hook a bigger one.  For the few times i fish them each year i have a Compre 7'6"" H Fast musky rod and a Convector cv30 for trolling less than 200$  and for casting, a 7' rod of the same specs, with a Shimano Corvalus reel.Again, just under 200$  If i ever start fishing them all the time, i will upgrade, but i get out 2 maybe 3 times a year for now.  Thats the way i see it anyways."
727521,jedimaster,2012-09-05 14:57:00,3472,"The thickness of the mono or floro leader gives you the abbrasion resitance from the teeth. Its not about raw breaking strength. I would recommend the thickest leaders you can afford. 100 pounds minimum. Go with a longer leader than you are used to as well, 18"" is the length I use for a floro leader. get teh pre tied ones with good clasps they will last several muskies, before getting too nicked up to work. Dito as above, they protect the fish better than even with coated steel wires.  Even in the south end of Pigeon I have caught a 49"" musky so be prepared.  I think your gear is fine for starting out, I would have gone with 50 pound braid at a minimum, 65 even better. If you get the bug you will be using a baitcaster in no time.  IMO a baitcaster gives you a few benefits.  1) Generally more cranking power 2) Generally stronger so it won't break 3) Stronger drag 4) generally more line capacity 5) options of better rods for musky   Things to keep in mind.... Try not to over play a musky. Your goal should be to have it released asap after hooking it. Be prepared to have it run under the boat. Be CAREFUL with teeth and hooks, in the panic of having a musky in the boat its very easy to get yourself hooked or bit.  Preperation is critical for the fish and yourself  This means having your camera ready to go, Your partners informed what to do, camera, pliers, cutters, netman etc... Your net ready to go(bigger the better, a craddle is relatively cheap and will suffice as long as you have two people, they also take up less room in the boat. I started musky fishing with a heavy action spinning outfit and I landed mmany musky on that setup before moving to a baitcaster setup. If you are prepared, organized and informed the gear you have should be fine.  I made lots of mistakes when I started musky fishing as do many, but listen to the advice people give you and you should be fine.... here is a little video we shot when we caugth a musky, as you can hear near the end panic ensued even though we had fished musky many times and had all the gear... we were not totally ready but everything worked out well and when it came down to it, the camera was dropped on purpose to get the big net...  BTW that rod as you can see is fully stressed and its an XH Musky rod. this is from pigeon...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3axhkz8WgCE"
727667,Pigeontroller,2012-09-06 01:20:00,2793,"The reason for the large Muskie nets is that they act like a holding pen, the net is left over the side of the boat, allowing the Muskie to remain in the water. Both for the unhooking process and afterwards before pictures are taken it has a chnce to recover.    "
727670,northernpike56,2012-09-06 01:24:00,717,"I will be using my pier fishing/salmon net, which is rubber coated, and quite big (appx 3' diameter). If/when I do catch a muskie, should I cut the line before attempting to unhook it, just to get the rod out of the way and have less line to get tangled? Does anybody do this?"
727671,Gregoire,2012-09-06 01:33:00,1397,"Just put your reel on freespool while you take the hooks out. Sometimes you can unhook the lure from the leader. I have never felt a need to cut the line. Seeing as if you catch a musky it will be your first make sure you take a big breath and organize yourself before you unhook the fish, but only if your net is long enough to keep the fish in the water. On a few occasions I have sent my fishing partner to the back of the boat while I unhooked the fish, as he was just too excited to safely handle the fish. If you can watch some videos about unhooking musky before your trip. Also if you release the fish and it does not go straight down, make sure to stick around. Sometimes a fish will stay along the surface and will need to be revived for a longer period of time. If it cannot dive down it could be hit by a boat."
727674,SlowPoke,2012-09-06 01:45:00,2984,"This is a great idea until you are accustomed to de-hooking and releasing these beasts. Taking an extra few seconds to retie might save a minute or two in net tangles. Don't be afraid to cut hooks; for your safety and the health of the fish. I've often just cut the split ring and been able to retrieve the hook afterwards. I always have a good assortment with me for this reason. Fluoro leaders: I use 80lb and tie them myself. I use a 48"" leader for trolling and when they get roughed up, I cut them down and retie for casting to about 18"". It's hard to find a long steel leader plus you get the benefit of being easier on the fish. They'll roll up in them pretty good."
727675,Pigeontroller,2012-09-06 01:52:00,2793,Lots of times I will even cut the hooks that are not in the fish...Safer for both ME and the fish.
727679,muskymatt,2012-09-06 02:03:00,2608," Long 3' plus steel leaders for trolling are pretty hard on Muskies. We experienced a Muskie on LOTW's that hit a Legend perch bait with a steel leader and it rolled in the line. Let's just say the steel leader was not kind to the scales,it was replaced with a fluoro leader and has been retired.   That said, 12"" single strand are always on my casting rods."
727680,muskymatt,2012-09-06 02:04:00,2608, Ditto
727809,jedimaster,2012-09-06 18:19:00,3472,Dito on the split rings. I will cut them if I have a big one hooked.
727996,cowanjo,2012-09-07 01:39:00,249,"Roaring Dan and Dax have it - cut the hooks on the lure and in the fish and Put your reel in freespool - take a few breaths and release the fish. Roaring Dan as greatest Net man I know should be listened too.  Pigeon is tough if you find a deep weed bank dont get stuck like a bass fisherman and go to shore and fish the structure you see, they will be in the weeds or edge"
727307,northernpike56,2012-09-04 20:22:00,717,"I'm going to Bobcaygeon this weekend from Saturday to Monday, and want to try to catch my first musky there this year. I have heard the Kawartha lakes (especially Pigeon) are a great place to start. I'm not looking for a huge 50 incher, more like something around 3 ft.My rod and tackle are as follows:8'0 H spinning combo spooled with 30 lb Sufix 832100 lb fluorocarbon leaders6"" grandma10"" jake2x mepps bucktail spinnermusky sized spinnerbaitall the proper release tools (hook cutters, 10"" needlenose pliers, rubber coated landing net, etc.)If theres anything else you think I need, please leave a reply.Are there any specific spots on Pigeon Lake where one would have a 'good' chance of catching a smaller sized musky? If you'd feel better, shoot me a PM. I purchased an Adventure Fishing Map of the lake, while not the greatest, it does give me a general idea of the location of most major structural points on the lake.Are there any 'special' artificials that seem to produce well on Pigeon?If you don't know the lake, or don't want to give up any spots, could you at lease give me some ideas of where to start looking for them? I've heard they like pencil reeds and weedlines, so I will look for those and cast my bucktails to them.Anyhow, even if I don't catch any muskie, I will still have a lot of fun catching bass and perch.Thanks,Matt."
727308,Squid,2012-09-04 20:39:00,1656,"Try around the gannon narrows bridge and around big island in 8 to 10 feet of water. The baits look good but the rod and line are a bit on the weka side.Your set up will handle the 30 to 38 inch class but if you catch a 40 plus fish, you will have a fight on your hands."
727310,Rich Nelson,2012-09-04 20:45:00,332,"i would suggest getting some 65 lb braid. Yes, you can catch Musky on 30 lb, but it wont stand up to the abuse of bigger lures, or bigger fish. Spinnerbaits are a great choice when looking for active fish.  If they arent responding, then try the grandma with a "" twitching"" retrieve. Trolling the Jake is an option as well. Find the structure on your map, and troll around it. Buying a bulldawg or other soft plastics would be a good idea as well. ( medium size dawg for that combo) There is no way to control what size Musky you might catch... Although on average, the southern half holds smaller skis ( and pencil weeds) Most importantly, if you want to catch one, put in the time. First one is the hardest, but stick it out. Good luck"
727311,northernpike56,2012-09-04 20:46:00,717,"6000 size. 300 yds of line. I'm still learning to use a baitcaster (don't own one, borrow my uncles/friends sometimes)."
727313,northernpike56,2012-09-04 20:48:00,717,"And shouldent the smaller ones (30-36"") be easier to catch because they aren't targeted as much, are more aggresive, and more abundant than, let's say a 48"" fish?"
727318,STJ,2012-09-04 21:01:00,12,"I also think you are light on the tackle, It would be fine for walleye which there are also lots in Pigeon but having said that it is not uncommon to have a musky take a walleye on the way in. Great fun.... not much left of the walleye after that though."
727319,Christopheraaron,2012-09-04 21:02:00,3525, I haven't even caught one yet and am getting into the addiction! Still need a good sized net and boat though!
727320,davey buoy,2012-09-04 21:04:00,5505,"I'm thinking,a 12"" steel leader and use your drag.Don't fight it hard.You'll get it in. Many people have fished for bass with less than you have, and still brought it in.Patience is what you'll need. Good luck. Oh by the way my late grandma on deer lake caught a 45"" musky on 8lb mono years ago with a spin cast reel. Not recommended ,but she got it in with a little help."
727323,ehg,2012-09-04 21:07:00,2666,"Fished around the northeast side Big Island for 30 yrs. Have caught mostly 32-38 inch fish, some up to 45 inch. Huge fish aren't abundant there since perch and walleye don't fatten them up. Spinnerbaits and bucktails work best."
727324,northernpike56,2012-09-04 21:08:00,717,"Exactly. I have got close to 30"" pike on a 1000 sized reel and a UL (crappie setup) and I got in, but it was tricky. Took lots of time but I got it in so I could do it with musky."
727327,davey buoy,2012-09-04 21:11:00,5505," Yes!!,it is possible. still like the steel leader,Sinclair why not?"
727328,davey buoy,2012-09-04 21:13:00,5505," That's the new way of thinking. Still many catch them by accident,and I'm sure they would survive with proper release care!"
727330,davey buoy,2012-09-04 21:15:00,5505," No reason, not that familiar with it."
727332,davey buoy,2012-09-04 21:20:00,5505," Obviously you no more than me, just my honest 2 cents worth:)"
727334,davey buoy,2012-09-04 21:27:00,5505," I may, every weekend I fish for pike and bass. Never use a leader just 8/30 pp with a swivel clasp and out of approximately 35 pike,haven't lost one spinner bait or lure. Luck probably. Musky on the other hand a little more toothy. That's why I suggested a leader. Fluro? maybe. NP."
727336,Live2fish85,2012-09-04 21:30:00,1633,Good luck up there.
727339,davey buoy,2012-09-04 21:43:00,5505,Need to pick up some 6lb fluro for my river fishing. Will be my first time using it. Do you think 100lb is a little heavy for musky?. Does diameter play into their sight?
727346,Rich Nelson,2012-09-04 22:05:00,332," Water temps are still warm, and a drawn out fight would more than likely kill the fish... especially with a newbie who doesnt have the practice in releasing them quickly. Yes, they can be caught on light tackle, but its a bad idea. If you catch them on light tackle while targeting other species, then not much you can do but your best to release them quickly. Just because they slowly swim off doesnt mean they wont be dead within 24 hrs.... Delayed mortality....happens more than we think."
727350,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-09-04 22:22:00,535,"  I use 150# mono leaders, I don't think they care. I've even caught bass on that setup. I mean, the lures have huge hooks dangling off them, and that doesn't seem to deter the fish from striking at all."
727351,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-09-04 22:25:00,535,I second upping your line to at least 65# just so you don't lose your lures from casting.
727352,davey buoy,2012-09-04 22:32:00,5505," Good point!,the lures can cost as much or more than the line."
727354,northernpike56,2012-09-04 22:35:00,717,"How far off the shore of Big Island should I be trolling? 30 ft? and would the little bobcaygeon river mouth also be a good place to fish for musky? I caught a lot of bass and panfish there, so there could be musky lurking around there?"
727358,Rich Nelson,2012-09-04 22:46:00,332," Most arent gonna give you the exact fish locations.... Big island is huge, so focus on the structures closest to the island. A little mapwork will point you towards the best locations"
727371,northernpike56,2012-09-04 23:03:00,717,"  Fair enough, thanks for the tip. I've been looking at my map for a few mins and have a couple ideas of where to try on the western side.. I'm not going to go into the back channel at all, way too many hazards."
727518,Raf,2012-09-05 14:29:00,3495,"nothing wrong with steel leaders if that's what you have, they are more bite proof than 500# fluoro."
