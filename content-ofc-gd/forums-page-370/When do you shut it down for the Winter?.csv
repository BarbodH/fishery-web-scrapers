727403,Dave Bailey,2012-09-05 00:20:00,1641,"Thanks to my IBS ice fishing, in fact most outdoor cold weather activity, is not possible. A cold draft across my abdomen is one sure way of setting it off, along with many other triggers. I can bundle up, but if it hits me then I have to get out of it quickly. So when the weather is cold enough to require me to dress like an astronaut, fishing goes into hibernation until spring."
727990,Beans,2012-09-07 01:20:00,3339, Thanks GB...I'm afraid they are a bit too expensive for me...my truck cost me less than what they want for some of the used ones...
727998,Stoty,2012-09-07 01:43:00,2910,Boat goes away when the ice is too thick on Quinte to get through! Ice huts come out soon after and the chase is on for monster eyes!
728004,craigdritchie,2012-09-07 01:49:00,1586,The problem with ice fishing is that it takes so long to make a hole big enough to fit the boat in.
725891,Spiel,2012-08-29 15:56:00,9065, Wimp.  Just messing with you Craig.
725892,Jds63,2012-08-29 15:59:00,1365,Sometimes I think i prefer hardwater season more ...
725894,Mack66,2012-08-29 16:10:00,19,when the dock comes out lol. Then its shore fishing till Jan 1st.
725896,Pigeontroller,2012-08-29 16:18:00,2793,"No use for Ice fish'n, I wind it up fishing Muskie into December then shut it down for a few months...Heated garage allows for winter boat maintenance and frankly I enjoy the break and am always raring to go come April!"
725899,crappieperchhunter,2012-08-29 16:32:00,2582,X2 Julian  :thumbsup_anim:
725934,craigdritchie,2012-08-29 19:03:00,1586," X2 !!  I really do hate winter, and have absolutely no use for freezing my tail off on some frozen lake trying to catch fish I wouldn't even bother with in open water, when there's such great fishing available just a few hours away. I no longer have as much time to fish as I once did, so it's very much a question of quality over quantity. I'll take three or four magnificent days chasing five pound smallmouth, pot-bellied southern muskies, stripers on topwater or salt water tarpon, snook and redfish over jigging up some half-thawed, wiener-sized perch every Sunday morning. Not that there's anything wrong with that .... I just prefer casting in open water.  Doing so in flip-flops with a cold beer in hand doesn't hurt either."
725935,Spiel,2012-08-29 19:12:00,9065,Chalk it up to envy Craig. I'm essentially stuck here so I make the best of it.
725939,jimmer,2012-08-29 19:31:00,2730,"Shut down December 15th in the kawarthas, then start back up December 16th in any lake that is open. I used to do the hunting thing but found I would rather take the time off to go fishing. There are even less anglers on the water then, with many of them hunting."
725949,Sinker,2012-08-29 20:03:00,8692,"Well, I've had my boat in the water every month for over a year now. As long as I can find a launch that's partially open, I go for it. I was fishing in january and even february this year because of the crazy winter we had.....all from the boat. Fishing the icefishing season from the boat was kinda cool....and the fishing was great!  I may be the last crazy IQ challenged on the kawartha's with a boat in the water, but I'm not fishing!        It never really ends, if you don't want it too  S."
725954,Broker,2012-08-29 20:17:00,482,That reminds me of the episode of facts of fishing where dave launche his boat and breaks through the ice and does circles to break up the ice so he can fish for largies. Looks fun LOL
725972,mike rousseau,2012-08-29 21:53:00,4661,Last year I fished open water all winter...  Hoping this year is the same...  But realistically... I'm in my boat till Christmas most years.... And back in in march....
725974,Fish Farmer,2012-08-29 22:01:00,2234,"I just buy stabilizer for lawn mower and snow blower, boat gas, in tank not long enough"
725983,Rod Caster,2012-08-29 22:22:00,5784, Quality fishing is certainly in the eye of the beholder
726024,Canuck2fan,2012-08-30 00:15:00,1444,"I only stop when I hear that dreaded skitter of my weight across the ice... More than once have driven over a bridge in the dark seen open water then park further down river walk down to my favorite spot only to hear THUNK and have to back track and walk down another trail to that open water. Love getting out in the winter it helps keep the crowds down, where I want to fish."
726026,ttahhan,2012-08-30 00:20:00,191,Fishing Turns on for lunkers as they start to feed there faces in shallower waters in a couple of weeks or even sooner... Get your braid and keep your line tight...Fishing good till November
726029,Whitespinnerbait,2012-08-30 00:26:00,2038,Mid- November or so
726056,hotsky,2012-08-30 03:12:00,400,"This is going to be my first winter since I started fishing, as long as the water is not frozen I'll keep fishing"
726108,G.mech,2012-08-30 14:03:00,830,"There was a fantastic picture posted on Spoonpullers a couple of years ago but I can't find it....it was a picture from a boat in open water  off of Grimsby with two guys downrigging about 100 feet or so from the edge of the ice where a bunch of guys were ice fishing....classic ""to each his own"" photo."
726113,mike rousseau,2012-08-30 14:25:00,4661,hers a little something that may keep you guys out later this year... we boated 27 walleye this day in late january... the 28th i think... in the boat... launching over ice... fishing within casting distance of the ice edge while ice anglers do their thing...          
726118,Rich,2012-08-30 14:48:00,3927,I cant go more than 3 days without fishing. Shutdown is not an option. I will fish chub minnows in open spots of the creek in my backyard if nothing else. But i gotta fish!
726130,Christopheraaron,2012-08-30 15:44:00,3525," Ha, I was doing that for most of the winter this year!"
726373,Beans,2012-08-31 18:48:00,3339,"Maybe sooner than I want to this year...  Normally, I take the boat out of the water around the 15th October but I had a bit of a health set-back 2 1/2 weeks ago and am not allowed to drive until after I see the neourologist on the 24th Sept then, who knows what he will have to say ...  My boys from London are coming here to fish tomorrow...I hope there is not too much water in the ""Tin of Beans"" as it is too far for me to walk to the dock where she is parked to empty her...mind you it won't take too long if there is as I built a portable bilge with a motorcycle battery and it works great...I also use the same battery for a stern night light...  I guess if I'm prohibited from driving and they lift my license, I'll look into getting a good used electric mobility scooter or golf cart... I could use my lawn tractor to get down to the lake but if I run out of gas...then what ? I might have to rig up sumpin' to carry a jerry can with me...  Don't get old...It hurts too much !!!  BTW...Where would one look for a used golf cart or electric scooter ???"

725844,jedimaster,2012-08-29 12:48:00,3472,Just wondering when everyone shuts down the fishing for the winter? For me its typically after the last Bass tournament and that will be in a couple weeks. Then its time to gear up for hunting... What about you guys? I'm sure the harcore musky and walleye guys are just starting to get there gear on...
725846,ecmilley,2012-08-29 12:53:00,2163,when i am breaking ice at the launch or the first sled trails open

725848,GBW,2012-08-29 12:56:00,8460,I don't.  I fish when ever for what ever all year.  the problem is finding time with my 2 kids in sports all year long...

725854,krixxer,2012-08-29 13:12:00,274, No other place like it. If I only fished one spot for the rest of my fife it would be it.   Do you take the boat out or just hand out on the shore?
725856,Dan668,2012-08-29 13:17:00,1120,"Usually out till December, or whenever the temps dip before zero, my boat isnt in a heated environment."
725857,jim,2012-08-29 13:24:00,124,NEVER!!!
725859,Jer,2012-08-29 13:34:00,1426,"My boat usually stays at the dock until mid-November, sadly mostly unused it seems these last few years unless we get a late run of nice weather.  October and November will usually find me shore fishing from the dock most evenings for jumbo perch and the always hoped for, but rarely caught pickerel. Some decent catfish in the mix as well.  It's really the only productive time of year on my shoreline when the heavy weeds have finally died back."
725864,ccmtcanada,2012-08-29 13:42:00,7971,"Last year, I fished some windy and cold days through November and December looking for Muskies in the Kawarthas until they closed...and then later Walleye at Quinte.  Fishnsled and I attempted to go out on Christmas Eve...the day before this area had open water...this is what we saw... "
725866,backbay,2012-08-29 13:52:00,773,Usually the second week of November we we shut down the cottage.
725868,kickingfrog,2012-08-29 13:55:00,8333,"It's just starting for me. Too many bugs, boats and people in the summer."
725869,backbay,2012-08-29 13:59:00,773,"No question it's a great time of year. The coffee in the boat tastes better on those cool mornings, the leaves will change colours soon, and it's quiet.... And the fish are hungry!"
725873,NAW,2012-08-29 14:13:00,4022,"Like many others here, fishing is a year round sport for me.  There's usually a few weeks between hard and soft water season when I relax, clean my car, do some home renovations, etc...  I do fish a lot less in fall time during the hunting season.  But it never really stops."
725874,kemper,2012-08-29 14:18:00,2232,"Generally I don't fish much in January, unless we have a mild winter like last year.  I keep busy by building rod (or 3) that I probably (certainly) don't need."
725879,fishnsled,2012-08-29 14:44:00,3520," No need to be offended. The OP has just put on the signal, changed gears and going down a different road. Still getting out and enjoying the great outdoors.     That was the latest that I've ever tried to launch a boat. At least we tried and the breakfast was great at the little hole in the wall restaurant.  Fishing never really stops for me as well. There is usually a break in December till the ice firms up and another at the end of March, early April till the ice is gone."
725881,fishnsled,2012-08-29 14:50:00,3520, 
725882,craigdritchie,2012-08-29 14:53:00,1586,"Shut down?  What's that?  I can't stand ice fishing, so once everything freezes tight I head south. Tennessee is only a 10 hour drive, and the best bass fishing of the year is in January and February. It's off season, so a decent motel is only about $49 a night. Smallies average 3 to 4 pounds, with the odd one over 6. It's a good jig bite. I've never tried drop-shotting them, but I would bet a Slammer would just crush big fish there. Maybe I'll give it a go this winter.  Or you can drive 9 hours south to Kentucky and fish open water for muskie and striped bass. It's awesome. Average for muskie fishing in January is 6 - 8 fish per day, mainly by casting Super Shad Raps. Or you can fish topwaters for the stripers. They love Zara Spooks, average about 15 pounds, and can peel line off your reel like a chinook. It beats standing on some frozen lake fishing for perch any day.  Or you can go to Florida for a couple of days of salt water action. Juvenile tarpon up to 30 pounds live under almost every dock, and are an absolute hoot on the same 9-weight fly rod I use for pike.    The ones in those two photos above are babies (10 - 12 pounds) .... this is right in downtown Miami, about a dozen steps from the hotel door. People feed them French fries. Florida is a long drive, but you can always find cheap flights out of Buffalo and just rent a car when you get there. It's a great, cheap way to enjoy some awesome winter fishing.  If you want to extend your steelhead season, go to BC. The flight is admittedly pricey, but it's off season so motels and everything else is super-cheap. You can fly to Victoria then rent a car and go fish the Island streams. It's a mind-blowing experience, and February is prime time.  There's no need to shut down fishing over the winter when there are so many amazing options."
725884,torco,2012-08-29 15:19:00,656,"Can't say I shutdown ever. I don't ice fish much but even in January and February I will get some of that in. Of course if the rivers are still open like last winter then its 12 months a year. Also since having kids I have learned to fish when I can, not necessarily when its ideal."
725886,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-29 15:32:00,10439,Shutdown? Why the heck would I do that? I use the boat until ice prevents me from launching and then I break out the ice fishing gear. If I were to sgut it down I would go nuts as the open water season is shorter than the ice season here!!! Besides I like catching big gators through the ice.              
725887,crappieperchhunter,2012-08-29 15:34:00,2582,I never shut it down. The end of September until about mid November is actually my fav time of year to fish. No bugs no god awful hot days and no crowds.  Then its ice fishing which I love as well...then its spring fishing...then summer fishing....then fall fishing all over again   :thumbsup_anim:
725888,jedimaster,2012-08-29 15:36:00,3472,  Hey I recognize that boat...
725889,jedimaster,2012-08-29 15:36:00,3472,"And I don't mean Ice fishing, thats the seaons after hunting season."
725890,DRIFTER_016,2012-08-29 15:45:00,10439," OH, in that case mid to late October when the ramps freeze up. Then the ice gear comes out @ the beginning of November.  + hunting season runs from August through spring so the gun can come along on the fishing trips."
