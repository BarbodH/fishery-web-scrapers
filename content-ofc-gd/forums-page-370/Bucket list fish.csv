I catch them from time to time, but never anything eatable.  I'd like to catch a laker in softwater (tomorrow, maybe).  I'll try for auroras again too, some day. But likely not for another couple years.  Aside from that, I'd need to travel hours away to catch fish I would like to catch but can't around here, like largemouth bass, brown trout, and musky (though I don't plan to buy musky gear, so I'd have to borrow/rent)."
