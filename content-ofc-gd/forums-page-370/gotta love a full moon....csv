726808,mercman,2012-09-03 02:18:00,7054,Hooking into a good sized Musky after dark is a real Heart pumper !!! Glad i got the chance to do it this trip.  
726809,Skipper D,2012-09-03 02:34:00,1970,"You should have been around the next morning Paul to see what Mike and i hooked into before we went for lunch .. lol . You guys sure look like you's had a great day out the day before by the looks of the pic's posted up here , congrats on you PB too there , awsome bunch of fish guys ..........."
726810,mistyriver1,2012-09-03 02:37:00,600,Nice going guys !!
726825,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-09-03 03:31:00,535,Did you get them trolling or casting?
726830,BradMc76,2012-09-03 05:07:00,56,I am still blown away by those suckers. Just....wow
726846,mercman,2012-09-03 13:42:00,7054," Trolling.We tried casting but the tip top guide on my brand new Compre Musky rod broke off after 4 casts,  so we had to go back to trolling. Nice rods, good garantee, but it will be cheaper for me to fix it myself, than ship it back to Shimano."
726970,Squid,2012-09-03 21:16:00,1656,Nice fish guys!!! Looks like the big girls are getting turned on!!  :good:
726974,kickingfrog,2012-09-03 21:20:00,8333,Thank goodness it was only some fish. I was half expecting a pressed ham or worse.
726989,skippy jr,2012-09-03 21:50:00,22,Those fish were huge.
727128,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-09-04 03:13:00,535,  Too bad about the rod. Gotta love the sound of the clicker going off!
727150,Billy Bob,2012-09-04 08:51:00,5865,ANOTHER Musky Delight Report from Musky Mike....with pictures of a funny looking dude in the first picture.....LOL.....
727161,mercman,2012-09-04 11:07:00,7054,  ya tell me about it. The weld broke that holds the actual guide to the tube Its a 5 dollar fix. but a pain.
727312,ehg,2012-09-04 20:47:00,2666, It is amazing how each musky has a different colouring and pattern despite being from same area.  Looks like an incredible day but that that 49 incher is superb fish.
726451,mike rousseau,2012-09-01 02:00:00,4661,had a great day with mercman... we boated 4 musky today... 43...46...49...51....  paul ended up getting a PB twice today...  the 51 was a snake tho.... huge head and tiny body...  i think the pics say enough...   enjoy        46   51   49 
726458,Pikeslayer,2012-09-01 02:11:00,1443,Awesome day men  Lookin forward to part II tomorrow.

726468,Dontcryformejanhrdina,2012-09-01 02:48:00,535,Nice job guys! Hopefully the musky are still on tomorrow.
726470,fishnsled,2012-09-01 02:55:00,3520,Awesome fish guys!
726479,mercman,2012-09-01 04:00:00,7054,Had a real blast!!!!Hats off to Mike though.His boat handleing skills kept us both safe and on course in the wind and waves.  A real pro on the water. Thanks my friend.
726480,mercman,2012-09-01 04:01:00,7054,"  Actually, it was white...... Go figure"
726483,manitoubass2,2012-09-01 04:06:00,11391,Great job MM and Merc!!! Congrats!  
726487,mirogak,2012-09-01 04:45:00,387,wow ... I think thats the biggest freshwater fish I've ever seen here...
726493,Handlebarz,2012-09-01 09:51:00,3790,Awesome Mike congrats on a very nice night out.
726509,mike rousseau,2012-09-01 12:01:00,4661,Thanks everyone...  It was an awesome day of fishing with an awesome friend...  Super happy Paul has a new PB at 46 inches...  And best of all the water temps have dropped making pictures possible in good weather.... The 43 incher was caught during 30km winds... So it never left the water....
726510,Roy,2012-09-01 12:09:00,13728,Good stuff Mike! How did those fish release? I'm hitting the water tomorrow and may just target walleye/bass.
726511,spincast,2012-09-01 12:11:00,3279,nice going guys - congrats to both of you
726514,rufus,2012-09-01 12:23:00,267,Beauties! Congrats on the PB Paul
726515,Rich Clemens,2012-09-01 12:26:00,3131,Sweet !!!!!!!!
726521,mercman,2012-09-01 14:43:00,7054," We were like a finely oiled machine. While one brought the fish to the boat, the other prepared the tools, and cleared the deck of obstructions.Quick measurement at boatside, camera ready, pic and back in the water.  All 4 swam away after a short rest beside the boat."
726593,Steve2012,2012-09-01 22:40:00,15,Nice fish!
726594,misfish,2012-09-01 23:02:00,29133,"That 49, is an awesome looking fish.Well done fellas."
726601,mike rousseau,2012-09-01 23:55:00,4661,  Water temps have dropped to 71-72...  So each fish is different... Depending on visual signs on the fish... Length of fight... How long it takes to remove hooks... Etc...  The first fish was a water release due to waves and heavy winds... The rest were landed fairly quick in calmer weather so I decided pics would be fine.... They all took off pretty quick... And none of the fish were hooked bad...
726604,fishsevern,2012-09-02 00:07:00,112,Nice fishes!  If I catch even one of those in the pool or bay this fall i'll be a happy guy.
726606,mike rousseau,2012-09-02 00:17:00,4661,  That was my favorite one of the day..  Thanks
726634,TroutnMuskieHunter,2012-09-02 11:39:00,1362,Beauty fish guys!!  Thanks for sharing!
726650,Rod Caster,2012-09-02 13:30:00,5784,good show guys. Can't argue with two PB's!!!
