726767,Christopheraaron,2012-09-02 21:03:00,3525,"Alright, today I decided to start tying some bass jigs, these are the results in chronological order  They are getting better!         "
726769,Spiel,2012-09-02 21:14:00,9065,They look good to me Chris and no doubt they'll get some bass and likely some weed walleye too!  Well done.
726772,northernpike56,2012-09-02 21:18:00,717,and pike too.  
726773,Spiel,2012-09-02 21:27:00,9065, No doubt.
726775,davey buoy,2012-09-02 21:40:00,5505,Pretty nice for your first ones!
726776,jedimaster,2012-09-02 21:44:00,3472,Only comment would be to experiment with the weed guards. Longer weed guards have never proved to me to provide more weedlessness.
726777,Christopheraaron,2012-09-02 21:51:00,3525, How long would you suggest I go? Because they are a little hard to tie around.
726782,Broker,2012-09-02 22:21:00,482,"I like the last one the best.  I'll be tying some crappie jigs in the winter fr ice fishing at lake niapenco, that is, if we get a winter this year lol"
726783,jedimaster,2012-09-02 22:43:00,3472,"I tend to trim mine by bending them back to the hook and adding a little bit. I think I saw a video on youtube where a guy recomended it as well. Mighta been iaconelli I can't recall. I'll see if I can find it. I mean you don't want it too short otherwise it won't deflect the weeds, but the ones in your pic are pretty huge."
726784,Christopheraaron,2012-09-02 22:44:00,3525," I like that one too, if you want I can tie you some jigs?"
726787,mercman,2012-09-02 23:11:00,7054,Really great Job x2 for shortening the weed guards a bit.
726788,kickingfrog,2012-09-02 23:13:00,8333,Another thing to experiment with is thinning out some of the guards. If you're fishing sparser weeds you don't as much guard.
726789,ttahhan,2012-09-02 23:16:00,191,"They Look Awesome i really like the second one, Nice work."
726790,Christopheraaron,2012-09-02 23:19:00,3525,"Thanks for the tips, I'm also experimenting with some more patterns, if anyone wants a few shoot me a pm."
726837,singingdog,2012-09-03 09:45:00,1047,"That last one is a nice tie, although all of them will catch fish."
726932,Christopheraaron,2012-09-03 20:10:00,3525,"Here's a few more,       "
726945,lunkerbasshunter,2012-09-03 20:26:00,2585,they look great!!  I am sure you will get into more then just bass with those jigs!  Very impressive
726950,fishindude,2012-09-03 20:31:00,220,"Ever thought of painting the head too?  These look great, keep up the good work!"
726952,Christopheraaron,2012-09-03 20:34:00,3525," Yeah, I was thinking of that, you know what kind of paint to use, other than powdered?"
727157,singingdog,2012-09-04 10:46:00,1047," If you are into selling them, powder paint is the way to go. If you are tieing them for personal use, you can use nail polish. The fish don't really care one way or another."
727174,Christopheraaron,2012-09-04 12:24:00,3525,"The main goal at the end of this was to sell them, so I guess powdered is the way to go. But my concern was that when I go to bake the paint the guards would melt?"
727181,d_paluch,2012-09-04 12:39:00,343,"They look great! I think I may try my hand at making some lures/jigs this coming winter. Call me stupid, but how do you fish these jigs?  I guess there would be no wrong way, yo-yoing them, swimming them, etcetera; but are there any other specific techniques?  Also, when and where would be the best time to use these? Obviously in weeded areas, but I am unsure.  If you can't tell I am still learning a lot! Hell, I just started using senkos for the first time this year (and caught my pb largie and some beaut smallies).  Thanks for the help in advance, and sorry for taking over your thread with my questions but I've been curious as to jigging techniques for a while"
727192,Christopheraaron,2012-09-04 12:54:00,3525,"More than pleased to answer them (I just started worming this year too), weeded areas and fished in heavy structure (like fallen trees) would be the most effective situations. All I can say for the jig making is try to keep it simple, I tried making these at first with a lot of material and realized that they didn't even look that good, so I started just using a couple materials on each one and they look a lot better now. Good luck!"
727196,Fish Farmer,2012-09-04 13:08:00,2234,"Chris when I make my jigs I dip them in Temclad paint then hang on a wire stretched about 5'to 6'. Does a nice job, just go back and take the drip of once it forms. Color is your preference. You've done a great job on trying"
727399,Christopheraaron,2012-09-05 00:15:00,3525,"Thanks FF, I'll have to pick some up. Until then, here is the most recent ""baby bass"" pattern...   "
