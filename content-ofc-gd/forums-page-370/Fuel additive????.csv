727096,reelinrolly,2012-09-04 01:44:00,281,Just had a question for you boat owners out there.  I bought a boat at the beginning of the summer and I have heard of some guys adding stuff to their fuel that is supposed to help their engine run better??  Do any of you guys do this and if so what do you use  I have a 2009 50hp merc  Thanks in advance
727098,mercman,2012-09-04 01:47:00,7054,"Seafoam and Stabil Marine.Semms like everyone uses them, so i figured do as they do"
727107,Pigeontroller,2012-09-04 02:00:00,2793,"Yup, stabilizer/ethanol treatment."
727112,woodenboater,2012-09-04 02:08:00,2277,"There were several long threads about additives etc here recently but I don't have the link so you may have to search the site, try using stabil or seafoam as search terms.  I use Red Sta Bil for winter storage and marine for seasonal use. Tank is always filled to the top."
727142,wormdunker,2012-09-04 06:25:00,1711,"I run premium grade Shell gas in my out board motor.  Shell burns cleaner because it does not contain ethanol.  Also if the gas is going to sit for a while I add gas stabilizer to the tank but make sure U run the motor for a couple minutes to ensure the stabilizer has run thru the gas lines, carb etc.  Stabilizer ensures the carburetor parts & other motor parts do not gum up.  Good luck"
727145,Moosebunk,2012-09-04 06:58:00,3970,Every few tanks or so the Seafoam goes through.
727155,Garnet,2012-09-04 10:14:00,2056,I run Seafoam.  My boat is high use and still every month I run the tank as low as possible. Then fill up with nice fresh gas add a can of Seafoam.  You continually fill up your tank the gas gets old and carb/injector build up becomes a problem.
727190,BillM,2012-09-04 12:49:00,17367,Star-Tron additive for both Yamahas on the boat + fuel water separator.
727254,reelinrolly,2012-09-04 16:06:00,281,Thanks a lot for the info.   I really appreciate ir
727625,bucktail,2012-09-05 23:31:00,1857,Wormdunker is on the money... only use Shell premium and then a bottle of Stabile Marine when its near the end of the season.
727986,skeeter,2012-09-07 01:14:00,1907,:thumbsup_anim:  I use star tron and seafoam both at the same time.
