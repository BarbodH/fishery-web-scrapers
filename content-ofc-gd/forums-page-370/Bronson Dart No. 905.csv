They had aout 5 rods there and each had a fairly old spin cast style reels, mostly old Zebco's. I then spotted an odd looking reel, again, spin casting. It's a Bronson Dart, No. 905 and I picked it up for five bucks. An inital ebay search only netted me value, somewhere around $20.00. Not lookin for any value thoughts, just anyone who has ever seen or used this reel or any other info they may have about it. http://cgi.ebay.com/VINTAGE-BRONSON-DART-9...p3286.m20.l1116 Thanks all!

The Bronson Reel Company was organized in June 1922 by E. J. McMahon, who formerly had been the sales manager of the Shakespeare Company. When the factory started there were 15 people working in a small store building on North Matheson Street in Bronson, Michigan. By 1950 they were employing 300 people during peak times, and had a payroll in excess of $750,000.  In 1928 they built a new 15,000 square foot factory on North Douglas Street. By 1948 the building had been added on to until it was three times the original size. Just prior to World War II they had 135 different reels in their line, with a price range from 25 cents to $750 for the largest J.A. Coxe Salt Water reel. In 1931 Bronson purchased the famous Meisselbach-Catucci line of reels, and continued to produce many of the Symploreel models until WW II. They also purchased the previously mentioned J. A. Coxe Reel Company in 1934. The Coxe reels were some of the most famous big game reels ever produced, and they also developed a line of level wind casting reels.  In the 1940s and 50s Bronson claimed to be the largest manufacturer of fishing reels in the world. They had produced up to 9,000 reels in a single day, and throughout the early 1950s they were building in excess of 1,000,000 reels per year. They held over 62 patents for reels.  here is a link with some examples  http://66.51.163.9/fishing/collection/inde...level1/Bronson/"
