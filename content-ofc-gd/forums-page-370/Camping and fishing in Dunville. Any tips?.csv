727040,hotsky,2012-09-04 00:15:00,400,"I'm going camping to Byng Island in Dunnville in 2 weeks, decided to try something other than Long point and it's a little closer to home. I plan to spend most of the time fishing and will bring my inflatable with a motor (love that thing btw!) I'll have my tackle box, so will see what works and what doesn't, but was hoping I can get some tips from people that fished there. What can I catch there? I'm guessing pike, bass, carp? Anything else? Any recommendations on lures or bait?"
727047,jimmy v,2012-09-04 00:27:00,33,"My dad lives down that way and regularly trolls the Grand from the dam down to the lake.He trolls Flicker shads ,cotton cordells and worm harnesses in brighter colors.He catches a good variety of fish,including bass, walleye sheephead and catfish-good luck when you go!"
727053,northernpike56,2012-09-04 00:32:00,717,"theres walleye at Byng Island for sure, I've seen people catch them, but I can't seem to be able to. Try drifting a worm or minnow under a float there- I have caught LMB, SMB, pike, channel cats, sheepshead, perch, crappie, and white bass doing that at Byng Island. I'm sure someone who has been more successful there could give you a few more tips."
727054,Rich Nelson,2012-09-04 00:37:00,332,"Big channel cats, and good walleye fishing. I would suggest fishin below the dam.... above is very shallow"
727110,Christopheraaron,2012-09-04 02:04:00,3525,"Right in the middle of the conservation area this spring I caught a giant cat that broke off when it got to shore, also my first carp. The water is very murky so I would use very dark or very light coloured lures so they stand out."

727160,STJ,2012-09-04 11:01:00,12,"I have launched form Bing, nice looking camp ground. The water in the channel around the island is pretty muddy, great for channel cats. I normally head out to the river and aim for the lake. River is low now so be careful. Even in the river you can go from 15ft to 2ft from one side to the other. all the above fish are there. I read there are over 40 spieces in that part of the grand. Good luck I will be back that way as soon as the walleye start to move in from the big water."
727165,hotsky,2012-09-04 11:51:00,400," Hopefully by than I'll have my fish finder so I'll know how much water is under me.  pretty excited for this trip, I'll get my GF a license so I'll have 2 lines in the water all day long. Don't know if I'll keep any fish yet."
727169,Rich,2012-09-04 12:16:00,3927,"Lol... Go in may. Its a dead zone til november. You'll catch mudcats, sheephead, if you're lucky - silver bass. If you're REALLY lucky - a resident walleye. It's a very seasonal fishery and you're a little early for the smaller fall run of lake walleye."
727178,hotsky,2012-09-04 12:29:00,400,"Oh well, at least I can put in a good effort.. What about pike and carp? Should be able to get them now, no?"
727179,Christopheraaron,2012-09-04 12:36:00,3525,You could try staying at brant and try for some bass and maybe walleye.
727182,Rich,2012-09-04 12:42:00,3927,"Id pick brant park over byng this time of year, hands down. With your inflatable and electric you'd have acess to big pike, smallies, maybe walleye and also wilkes dam which holds all of the above.  Carp in the grand at dunnville, for sure. Big ones too.  Pike? I've caught 3 in dunnville in my life, and never one in the summer. There are some smallies, but they run rather small and are difficult to locate. You could day trek to cayuga from dunnville though where you're more likely to connect with the species you listed."
727183,Rich,2012-09-04 12:43:00,3927,"Ps: i also own a 12ft inflatable w/ electric and i own 2 other boats.. Its by far the best purchase of the year. Since buying it, i have only used the other boats twice. So convenient and really goes anywhere unrestricted!"
727223,northernpike56,2012-09-04 14:00:00,717,"I caught a very large SMB at brant 2 years ago, right below the dam.. I still have the pic, I can post it after school today. In may at Byng last year I think I got 4-5 big LMB (oos) drifting minnows.. It was a nice suprise cause I thought that LMB wernt even in the Grand. Oh ya and a couple huge channel cats"
727390,young_one,2012-09-05 00:01:00,620,"2 dozen worm, a dozen heavy sinker, and a couple pickeral rigs. Wait and secure your rod with a rope. Carp, channel cat, drum, sucker, white bass, largemouth, smallmouth, walleye with 'lip rings', Steelhead. I've caught them all at Dunnville"
