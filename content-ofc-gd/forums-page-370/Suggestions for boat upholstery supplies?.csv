I have a friend that will do all upholstery but I'm looking of course to get it done cheaply. Of course sticking to ""marine grade"" outdoor vinyl/foam etc. but just wondering if anyone here has recently found some good deals.  I'm in the Hamilton area and have been told there are decent shops downtown (ottawa street) etc. Also told online is the best way to go and the best economically even with shipping cost.  My wife is ""auditing"" the ""fix up""...  Thx ahead."

727467,Raycaster,2012-09-05 03:54:00,528," Thank you for the replies. Yes, will replace drivers seat with a low-back seat at that price for sure.  Didn't mention but its a pontoon boat and the I rebuilt all the furniture but just need the vinyl now. Will check out Len's Mill, again thx."
727507,Fish4Eyes,2012-09-05 12:52:00,1022, What he said. I looked into re-apolstering my boat seats but after getting a few quotes decided it wasn't worth it. Keep in mind your cushions are more than likely worn out and don't offer the same support new seats would. I highly recommend Attwood seats. I believe I bought mine from Iboats.
