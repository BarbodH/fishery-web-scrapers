Here is my first fish for 2012, a 22 inch brown trout. I caught this one at la salle Marina in January on a rapala husky jerk.     These are some fish I caught for dinner, any guesses on the weight of the pike? I thought a good 3-4 pounds. It has been the fattest pike I have caught this season.     Next pic is the first walleye I caught at the cottage this year. He wasent very big, only 13 inches, but still tasted great.     A good catch of walleye as well as 2 bonus perch at the cottage:      11 inch speckled trout I caught in a creek near my cottage. He was a keeper (that's why I 'rough handled' him).    I went to a family friends cottage a few weeks ago, and went out in their canoe with their little guy Hunter. We were casting to a fallen tree, both with rapala original floating lures, and this monster came out and smashed his lure. His first pike and He's only 5!!!    Thought I'd share, I thought these pics were cool.  Matt."

727501,Rod Caster,2012-09-05 12:36:00,5784,Great photos and catches. Its nice to get into a walleye feed or two. I'd say two or three pounds for that pike.
