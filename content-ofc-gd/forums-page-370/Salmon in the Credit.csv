We just had a big rain storm here, but I was wondering if it's too early to go out and catch salmon.  Does anyone know if they have started up river.  Also could anyone offer me any advice on techniques to catch them, right now the main thing I'm doing is floating a pink trout worm down river and adjusting what levels it drifts down at.  Any advice would be great.  Thanks"

Best bet if you miss the prime conditions is to fish glow spoons between dusk and dawn.  Rattle cranks in firetiger work decent during overcast days, as do standard casting spoons.  Hot n Tots give plenty of vibration to pizz em off too. I be out right now and tomorrow morning if I lived where you do.  Good luck!"

I would assume guys have started catching them south of Lakeshore by now.  Since you are close, take a walk along the pier there should be guys fishing from shore by now in the evenings."
