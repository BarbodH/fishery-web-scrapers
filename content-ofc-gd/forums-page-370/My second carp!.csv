Weather was beautiful, most of the time wind was almost non existent, making for some very calm water, (wind and inflatables don't mix well lol). Caught 2 crappies trolling with spinners and lost another one boatside. Also lost a nice bass...:/ Pulled into a bay where I caught my first carp before, by less them ideal method - I saw it 2 feet from shore in weeds so I dropped hook with corn on it where the fish was and sure enough when I pulled the line it was hooked. My fiance said 'that's cheating' <img src=""http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/forums/public/style_emoticons/default/rolleyes.gif"" class=""bbc_emoticon"" alt="""">. Today after a few frustrating tried to hook another carp it finally happened! I dropped a hair rig in a spot where I saw a lot of bubbles, no real expectations of it catching it, but after a few minutes I see the bobber diver under with full force! I grabbed the rod and started reeling it in, but I set the bobber 5 ft from the sinker (+ another foot till the hook) so was having a hard time bringing the fish close enough for me to net it. It put up a good fight; trying to go under a boat, changing directions ect., then I finally managed to scoop it up. I tried taking other/better pics after, but my hands were wet and it didn't work (stupid touch screen phone!) Too bad you cant even see it all, it looked bigger in person I swear! lol<br><br><a href=""http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/217/20120905142157.jpg/"" class=""bbc_url"" title=""External link"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/3305/20120905142157.jpg""></a><br><br>Uploaded with <a href=""http://imageshack.us"" class=""bbc_url"" title=""External link"" rel=""nofollow"">ImageShack.us</a>"
