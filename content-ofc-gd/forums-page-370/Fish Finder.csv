725496,hoops12,2012-08-27 20:04:00,127,"I'm looking for a ""do it yourself"" transducer mount for a portable fish finder.  I hate it when the suction cup fails and i get readings of 100ft when i'm in 3 ft of water.  Please send me your pics or idea's!  Thanks for your help.  Hoops12"
725498,Terry,2012-08-27 20:16:00,14456,so what are you mounting it on  a transducer mounted on a 1x2 by 2ft piece of wood and a C clamp worked great for me
725500,hoops12,2012-08-27 20:19:00,127,I will be mounting it on the back of a 16 foot tinner.  Thanks
725502,GBW,2012-08-27 20:25:00,8460,2x on that.  it's easy and takes seconds to put it on the boat.
725527,Garnet,2012-08-27 21:37:00,2056,I was high tech. 1x3 and a c clamp
725531,kickingfrog,2012-08-27 21:43:00,8333,   x3   Always one in the bunch.
725535,adempsey,2012-08-27 21:54:00,1498,"I bought a metal portable transducer bracket for mine and it's terrible.   There might be better models out there, but I wouldn't waste your money on one and stick with a 1X2 or a hockey stick and a C-clamp."
725551,NAW,2012-08-27 23:22:00,4022,"I made mine out of a peace of aluminum.  Same idea though.  The only pain in the butt, is sometime the clamp rattles a little bit with the motor is running."
725559,RickOnt,2012-08-28 00:00:00,669,Hockey Stick and a C-clamp.  Rick
726100,hoops12,2012-08-30 13:25:00,127,Thanks.....hockey stick it is!
726124,kickingfrog,2012-08-30 15:19:00,8333,Make sure it is a composite stick that costs at least $150 and has a 190 flex rating.
727257,hoops12,2012-09-04 16:14:00,127,  I will...lol.  Thanks again guys
727381,Rich,2012-09-04 23:34:00,3927,"I used zip ties, and the handle off an old swiffer sweeper. I bought a $5 clamp and clamp it to the side of my boat, or just drop it down for a sec if just to check depth. Works pretty good, i must say."
