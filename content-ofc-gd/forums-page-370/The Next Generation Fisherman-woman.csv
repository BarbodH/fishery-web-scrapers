727414,NAW,2012-09-05 00:48:00,4022,Yes.  But you can still out fish them!   I think Kevin has one in his  might have to shack up there
727104,NAW,2012-09-04 01:56:00,4022,"One of the reasons we try to to conserve our fisheries and wildlife, is to one day be able to enjoy it with our children and grand-children.  Last night, that moment became one step closer with the birth of my son Alexander.  He is our first child, so we where expecting a battle in the delivery room.  BUT we where surprised!!  Mel (my wife) started to get cramps at 5am Saturday morning.  The contractions started to get bad around 6pm.  By the time we got to the hospital is was 9:30pm.  Alexander popped out at 11:30pm, 2 hours after we got there.  The doc was tied up in an emergency surgery, so no drugs for my wife  :stretcher:     Man oh Man, words can not explain the profound respect I have for my wife after witnessing this event.  :worthy:  I don't want this post to be all about Alex and my family.  I know there are a handful of members who are expecting any time now, or in the coming fall.  If you've got pics of your next generation fisherman/woman, please post them up!!  It's all about family right!!    This is Saturday around Noon.   This is literally 12 hours later.         I hope some more members with newborns post up some pics too!  Or anyone who wants to show off some photos of their kids enjoying the outdoors!!  Heck, we have posts where we show off our pets, cars, songs... Why not our kids!  I'm so pumped to teach him how to use a baitcaster"
