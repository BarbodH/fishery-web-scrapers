726827,largemouthtrout,2012-09-03 04:15:00,53,"I was fishing in the Grand tonight caught a few decent smallmouths and a rock bass .. and then theres the one big that got off the hook after jumping like a marlin ( most likely a bass ) .  Anyways , it was getting darker when i caught this other fish , so i didn,t get the greatest look . first i thought it was a smallmouth , untill i got it out of the water .Then i thought it was a big rock bass , but it didn,t look right . after looking at some pics online , the closest thing i can compare it to is a white bass . ( like i said though .. it was getting dark )  looked like stripes down the length of the body , but the stripes seemed more like rows of dots .  I never caught a white bass before ( if thats what it was ) . Anyone heard of white bass in the Grand ?"
726828,HTHM,2012-09-03 04:21:00,4082,"I have caught white bass in the lower grand, so it is possible. Without a picture it is hard to be sure."
726849,mercman,2012-09-03 13:46:00,7054,"Sounds about right for a White Bass, or Silver Bass.I caught one here on Lac St. Louis a few weeks ago.Here in Quebec we have to release them."
726851,ch312,2012-09-03 14:00:00,1590,"silver bass  there's white perch in erie too, but they don't have the lines like a silver bass.   \both taste great"
727678,chris.brock,2012-09-06 01:56:00,4053,"type ""gizzard shad"" into Google Images and see if that looks like what you caught, I've caught them below Dunnville"
727683,dsukh,2012-09-06 02:12:00,24,Possibly white bass or white perch.
727691,craigdritchie,2012-09-06 02:31:00,1586,Sounds like a white bass. The Grand gets a decent run of them below Dunnville every May. They're a blast with an ultralight and some tiny spinners.
727705,Musky or Specks,2012-09-06 04:26:00,2710,If you were fishing in the KW area Im guessing black crappie they are around here and there
727711,Roy,2012-09-06 10:04:00,13728, Only the stripers Paul. You cannot keep a striped bass.
727713,Rich,2012-09-06 10:24:00,3927,Could have been a crappie depending on what stretch you were fishing. Used to get the odd one in the brantford stretch .
727739,The JAY,2012-09-06 13:08:00,239,"Mooneyes are all over the Grand. Very silver, and I have seen the bigger ones have 'stripes'. Never seen one launch itself though..."
