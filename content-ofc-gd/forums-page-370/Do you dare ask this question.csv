I generally stick to the Severn Sound, but that's because it is close, and there are some sheltered areas I can fish with my 14' tinner."
727534,bushart,2012-09-05 16:39:00,2628,There's a Beach nearby where bikinis run throughout  And a river flows in so no need to pout  They can be found there in this general locale  Just tell the wife---hey I'm fishin with a pal   Orrrrrrr......  There's a place nearby that's pretty fair to (guess)  With a bay near the town with a prison type facility no less  Find the channels between the weeds and you'll be hap---hap---happy  Now go forth and catch young Skipper D

727543,adempsey,2012-09-05 17:16:00,1498,"Sparrow, Dalrymple and Canal Lake are about 1 hour from you.  Never fished them but I believe they hold walleye.  Lots of lakes <2 hour drive."
727605,Pikeslayer,2012-09-05 22:27:00,1443,I'll show you an awesome walleye lake in September Skip.     90 minutes from your front door. 9/29 mark it on your calendar.
727647,mike rousseau,2012-09-06 00:32:00,4661,"  Lol   The rod you really liked the feel of was a st.croix legend extreme 7'11"" heavy.... Keeping in mind the size of some of the walleye I catch... Most guys say I'm nuts for using a rod like this.... But most guys don't fish the st.lawrence... I know guys trolling walleye with musky rods...lol  Realistically.... A 7 foot medium heavy fast action baitcaster is probably the best set up for you...."
727649,Skipper D,2012-09-06 00:41:00,1970,"First off i have to give a big thanks here to all the guys who answered my thread , i realy thought i was going to be left on my own with this one but that was'nt the case and i say thank you every one , second i got to thank those who sent the PM's , Thank you guys very much for all your help ,  i just got back from scouting out a hot tip for a walleye spot not far from my place  ,  i found theres a great place to launch my boat so now a can't wait to get geared up and go give it a try .
