515793,brandon,2010-10-29 02:18:00,857,Thanks guys and thanks for posting it Krisco!  Definitely a first thing for me to have something written about what I've done in the paper so it was a pretty cool experience...I believe another local publication is sending a writer to interview me about the trip as well so we'll see how that turns out.
515798,NAW,2010-10-29 02:34:00,4022,Good on ya Brandon.  I don't know how I would feel with a grizzly sneaking up on me.  You must have nerves of steel.
