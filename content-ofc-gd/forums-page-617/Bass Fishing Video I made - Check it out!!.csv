I have joined a bass fishing club this year decided to have my main focus on tournament fishing. I thought some people on here might like to see it, so here's the link! Also if your internet connection is good, be sure to watch it in HD!  "

My best reason for joining. Learning and teaching and we get to go out and do stuff with kids to properly teach them how to fish and respect this hunting and fishing and the great outdoors."
