515389,BillM,2010-10-28 00:58:00,17367,That pretty much defines 'Gin Clear'  Awesome pic!
515395,danc,2010-10-28 01:11:00,4677, Bill. I once drank a bottle of gin that was cloudier than the water in this photo. Or at least the last 1/3 of the bottle was.

515814,chilli,2010-10-29 03:47:00,199,Is the boat even touching the water? Wow!
515836,mbac31,2010-10-29 11:54:00,904,Awesome picture. You better bring some light line and a rocket launcher to get that bait 1000 yards away from the boat.    Its gonna be some hard fishing when the fish can see you coming from the other side of the lake.
515914,TJQ,2010-10-29 17:03:00,7806,wow....
