I do almost all of my fishing on Balsam because its closest to home and usually I only have half a day to get out. With more time on my hands I'm looking to try out some new waters. Was thinking Pigeon or Lower Buckhorn or anywhere else that sounds reasonable. The key is, I'll need accomodations for one night. Anyone know of places that are still open and willing to rent out a cabin for 1 night?"
515356,Handlebarz,2010-10-27 23:59:00,3790,Check out sunny achers on Cameron lake they have a couple cabins and might let you stay for a night
515361,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-28 00:08:00,2582,Buckeye right in Bobcaygeon. Right on the water so you can tie up the boat there. Most rooms have full kitchens.  Not a cabin but handy to everything. Quiet but right on the water in town. Stayed there for years before we got our own little place up there. Joyce and her crew will look after you. Check out the link below.          http://www.buckeyecentre.ca/
