"
515558,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-28 14:11:00,0,"  You keep on with the ""let it spoil"" idea. It's not spoiled if other things eat it. The fact that you can be fined for keeping a slot is key here as well as other have mentioned. It's your choice."
515559,craigdritchie,2010-10-28 14:14:00,1586,"AverageJoe, I think you're missing the point.  Does anyone want to leave a hook in a fish? No, of course not. But there are times when - depending exactly where the fish is hooked - you can do more damage trying to move the hook than you will by leaving it in place. Like it or not, that's reality. And for what it's worth, there are human beings walking around on this earth with bullets in them for the same reason - it's safer to leave it where it is than try to remove it. One of those people, a former US Army Ranger, happens to be a very good friend of mine.  When you land a badly-hooked fish, you make a judgement call. At the end of the day, the primary goal is to keep the fish alive so that it will spawn again, and perhaps give someone else a thrill. The fact you caught two fish with hooks in them yourself confirms this line of thinking works. Had someone else taken your approach and killed those fish, you wouldn't have caught them, would you?  Your fishing show host might have done a better job of explaining why they chose to leave a hook in a fish, but that's about it. Good for them for at least trying to make the point that badly hooked fish don't need to die. Most TV hosts would just cut after boating the fish, and not even air the unhooking part."
515566,mercman,2010-10-28 14:42:00,7054,"So whats the solution? Personally, i don't think there is one really. We all have our morals, standards and the law to live with, and its up to each of us as individuals to interpret these. Laws are more specific and more binding than morals and standards, which are usually emotionally founded. I do not want to risk losing my gear because of a badly hooked fish.I have on rare occasions put an illegal fish back in the water after cutting the line or hook. I hate doing it, but i would hate to lose my boat and get a fine even more. AJF, your morals and standards are to be commended. You are the type who would risk it all to do what you feel is right.Bravo And the rest of you are also to be commended. You live by the laws put in place to protect this sport, and do all that you can to preseve it.Bravo to you all too !!!  Now go to your corners and be good little boys and girls  "
515579,canadadude,2010-10-28 15:46:00,769,Here's a solution sell your gear and buy golf clubs hahahahaha
515586,mercman,2010-10-28 16:10:00,7054,   dont golf courses have a no wake policy
515589,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 16:22:00,70,"Ok this is my conclusion on my topic and it's the last thing I will say... You guys who release fish even if it dies , i'm not saying it's wrong. But it's wrong in my mind, if the fish is legal everyone should keep it and if it's illegal it's up to you. If you follow the law good for you I'm glad your following the law   But ""MY"" law says that wasting fish is wrong too some people say that it won't be wasted something else will eat it... Yes it is true something will eat it or even leeches will chew on it but the fact of the matter is I killed it and my morals and my mind won't be right if I just leave it floating.... Sorry it's just how I feel, I think there's two ways too look at it... Me I do what i think is right not what the law says... Wasting is against my nature, i don't like wasting anything for that matter, and leaving a fish there in my mind that i killed myself is considered wasting from my point of view... I follow every limit and every slot size like I invented them myself even if a fish is right on the line when it's considered legal I release it, and over the slot fish are all released but if it's gonna die my consience won't be at ease to have killed a fish and left it floating... It's almost like murder and hiding the body in the bush with the famliy members unknowing of where the body is, that is just how i think... Sorry it's my opinion and others can have different opinions and it's all right there is nothing wrong with that and no i'm not gonna buy golf clubs ! lol"
515591,Mike Pike,2010-10-28 16:25:00,1332,"AverageJoe, both your examples show the fish coping quite well with hooks( jigs )in 'em.  Now, as far as them not disolving, until you can determin how long a hook has been in a fishes mouth, you can't say it doesn't disolve.  In your one example, we only know that they don't disolve in a week.  Sometimes, harvesting is not an option because of slots etc. so I would much rather cut the line."
515592,Garnet,2010-10-28 16:29:00,2056,I always have offset side cutters in my boat. They work great for cutting hooks very close to gills and throat. That gives the fish a chance.  And I release all out of season fish and hang around a bit if they float up and are diffidently not going to make it I remove air sac and sink them.
515606,spinnerbaitking,2010-10-28 17:13:00,1622,"I've never released a dead fish so I know I'm not breaking the law & if you cut the line or hook as close as you can, release it & it swims away neither did you, but if you kept the fish because you think it's going to die, you are breaking the law & unless you tag the fish or put a transmitter in it you can't say you know it was going to die, lots of examples posted here proving you wrong, hooks in live wells, coming out there butt Richard"
515613,mercman,2010-10-28 17:53:00,7054,"since getting WFN, i've noticed a lot of things by different hosts that make me wonder if they really shouldn't be looking the program over before airing it. I've seen variuos anglers with fingers rammed in the fishes gills, then release it. I even saw one bleeding from the gills and put into the water.They should edit this out or at least mention why they are putting an injured fish back in the water, whether it be OOS or slot fish. That would avoid people like me seeing it and wondering if these professionals are really professional  "
515615,cram,2010-10-28 18:08:00,1733," take a hook, put in a glass of water, and let it sit on your desk for a couple of years.  Hook will still be there, guaranteed."
515623,MCTFisher9120,2010-10-28 18:27:00,3761,"I had a bass last season get a hook swallowed...and yes I was using live bait with my little brother that day. I kept the fish. If you are using live bait in the start of the year you will catch OOS fish cause a worm or minnow is not species specific. Keeping a OOS walleye for example because it swallowed your hook is stupid to say the least. Now that fish wont spawn out in a few days or weeks and I hope your ass gets caught for poaching. I caught a bowfin last winter through the ice, it had thick braid maybe a inch or two peaking out of it's anus...I bet it's fine now and still swimming. As for ""how would u like it if u had a hook in your throat""? I wouldn't but I doubt a fish even realizes it's there...after all fish do not have nerves and can only feel vibrations.  Remember their brain is the size of a pea, if that fish is hungry and it's mouth is glued shut, ITS GOING TO TRY TO EAT!  As others said, go barbless if u must, go without live bait( I did all summer bass fishing) or just spend more money on sensitive rods....2 or 3 seconds after a bite it all it takes for a fish to swallow your bait...but do you feel the bite right away? Better gear results in faster hook ups and less troubles.  I didn't pinch down 1 barb this season. I also didn't take fish because I saw a hook in their throat(witch I did with 2 fish) One of them a 5lb largemouth, the other a 7lb 7oz bowfin. Both fish were fat and as strong as can be.  ...There's a couple minutes I'll never get back"
515638,Terry,2010-10-28 19:02:00,14456,"yeah he missed the point completely the example he gave proved fish do live to bite another day with a jig in it's stomach again chances are the jig was bit off so no angler had anything to do with releasing it, so meaningless   bass fishermen how many times have you had a tube too far inside so you cut the line and put it in the livewell  when you put the fish in the bag for the weigh in you see your tube and hook sitting on the bottom of your livewell.........  I think they do real well with the hook or a piece of it left in the fish  and I sure would not be a poacher and keep illegal fish......... some peoples ethics our unbelievable ... the real law says it wrong"
515649,Mike Pike,2010-10-28 19:21:00,1332,"Again, not a fair test.  Now if I could take a hook, put it in a fishes mouth or stomach, and let it sit on my desk for a couple of years, well, that'd be a different story."
515652,bigcreekdad,2010-10-28 19:25:00,546,"I second the barbless hook thoughts. You keep a tight line, you won't lose many at all. And fish survival rate goes way up. I've taken 5 fly in trips to Quebec, Manitoba etc. and used barbless streamers for pike, brookies, and lakers.....we very seldom lost any fish. I believe it's the law in manitoba."
515665,Terry,2010-10-28 19:59:00,14456,I thought it was an enzyme in their blood that dissolves the hook I don't remember them saying it was the water
515668,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-28 20:09:00,0,  Some feel they are above the law Terry and that their ideals are OK. Funny how that point keeps coming up around here ....
515670,NBR,2010-10-28 20:14:00,163,I have fished barbless for years and this plus the In-Fisherman hook removal method solves most problems. For those who fish with me and are not barbless I have a thing called a Barb-Bit that cuts the barb off and has magnets to get the hook pieces out of the fish. For those fish that I am sure won't make it I call them tasty.
515694,steverowbotham,2010-10-28 21:33:00,1800,"If you left a jig in its mouth, by accident or not, and it ate again a week later for you to discover this horrendous issue, then what does that tell you?  It ate again....  I would never leave a hook in a fish's mouth if there was another option, but sometimes you need to.  Ripping it out of their throat is going to do worse things to it, I can guarantee that.  I fish 15-20 tournaments a season usually and I cant tell you the number of jigheads I have left in a fish's mouth and had them spit it out in the livewell.  If its bleeding badly, pour some 7UP down its throat, it'll stop bleeding pretty quick and give it time to recover.  I swear it works. Point is that it happens and sometimes the fish lives, sometimes it might not.  But I can tell you a fish has a better chance of living if I release it than if it ends up in my freezer."
515700,spinnerbaitking,2010-10-28 21:42:00,1622,"I don't use bait for fishing but if I did I'd likely try circle hooks, anything I've heard about them makes it sound like they eliminate deep hooking pretty much, any one use them much Richard"

515815,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-29 03:59:00,1107,"Well I was on the WFN ambassador site and saw your blog there and thought I would do a google search and wouldn't ya know it I was led to a OFC post from 2008 which asked the same ??? do hooks dissolve in a fish and Musky or specks replied with a quote from the minnesota DNR which I thought was interesting there is also a few articles that do suggest that they do in fact dissolve in a fish it's hard to say though without some real scientific studies to go by here's Musky or specks reply from the other post.   From Minnisota DNR page  Ask the DNR Q. In its statements on catch-and-release, the DNR says it's better to leave a deeply im-bedded hook in a fish's mouth and cut the line than to rip the hook out. The hook will supposedly dissolve. But how do biologists know this? en  A. There is no existing scientific research on the topic, but DNR fisheries biologists have observed fish surviving with hooks in various stages of ""being dissolved"" in their bodies. And many anglers have caught fish with a partially dissolved hook in its gut.  Many variables determine how fast the hook will dissolve, and if the fish will survive at all. These include hook location (throat, stomach, mouth, etc.), hook size, fish size, temperature (most reactions occur faster at higher temperatures, so a hook would probably dissolve faster in the summer than in the winter). A hook in the mouth may dissolve, but it could also work loose and fall out. A hook in the mouth might hamper feeding behavior, but only temporarily.  A hook in the gill, however, will almost always prove fatal because it interrupts the respiratory process before it gets a chance to dissolve. Hooks in the stomach will nearly always dissolve, if internal organs have not received life-threatening damage from the hook (such as during a fight between fish and angler).  How long does it take for a hook to dissolve? Again there are lots of variables, such as hook size and fish size. DNR fisheries biologists estimate that it would take roughly two to three weeks for an ?average? hook to be dissolved by the ?average? fish?without too much indigestion.  I often will kill a fish because it is gut hooked and bleeding. Stainless steel hooks of coarse will not rust out. Of coarse any fish deep hooked that is kept has no chance for survival."
515447,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 02:33:00,70,But they on most shows the fish is legal?? If it's legal why put it through this kind of suffering??

I'm not trying to be difficult with you, but clearly you are admitting that you would break the law, which doesn't quite fly real good around here.

515451,ctdd2006,2010-10-28 02:35:00,531, Fair enough...and I agree with you....but  it's the consequences I fear.   the conservation laws I like to believe are there for a reason.  Cheers.

515453,timmeh,2010-10-28 02:38:00,609,"I agree with Dan about fishing barbless and with no live bait. It's usually very easy to remove barbless hooks even if they are deep, so I assume they'll fall out relatively soon. I personally think only barbless hooks should be legal.  But I agree with you about fishing shows promoting that when there are easy alternatives. What I do is carry small wire cutters with me. That way when I occasionally deep hook fish I can cut the hook and leave only a small point still in the fish. That way no big jigs or lures stuck in. I believe this gives the fish a much better chance."
515454,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 02:41:00,70,  Like i said Im not one to argue But if it would happend a second time well then i'm doing something wrong... It never happend to me once in my life I dont think it will ever happend the way i fish but i just wanna say that they shouldn't say that the hook will disovle when it clearly dosen't... I dont wanna argue with anyone i just wanna tell the truth i'm not a liar and just want fisherman to know my opinion if u dont like my opinion that's fine everyone have different views on things the world would be boring if everyone would think the same... and is it against the law to waste a gamefish I think about the law in that favor not in the other way... I trully beleive in releasing slot size fish and always will release them unless they die   Sorry this is how I feel I'm not gonna waste a fish that is not how my mind thinks I have trouble throwing a piece of meat in the garbage i won't be able to leave a fish there floating   I know lots of you won't agree with me i can trully understand but this main point of this topic was to prove that hooks don't rott out it's just not true fisherman need to stop beleive that they will thats the only thing i want people to know
515456,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 02:44:00,70,"  That is a great hint on giving the fish a better chance instead of cutting the line   That is what i'm mad about , fishing shows shouldn't promote cutting the line and leaving the entire lure or jig there ?"
515457,ctdd2006,2010-10-28 02:45:00,531, but I've been told since I was a wee boy the fish and turtles have enzymes in their saliva that dissolve all that!?     I'm gonna blame it on Italo!!!

515482,cram,2010-10-28 03:51:00,1733,Hooks don't dissolve in fresh water.  At least good hooks don't.  SOmeone made a point about the cheaper/crappier hooks and they're right.....might actually be better for the fish.  I don't use barbless but do cut the hooks if/when there's an issue.
515484,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-28 03:59:00,0,It does not happen often enough to be a problem. Get yerself a good pair of cutters and stay on it. It's all you can do. Sometimes you lose a few.  Don't sweat it.  As for leaving metal in humans or fish..  They leave metal in us people all the time and it sure doesn't kill us. Some of us even benefit from it!!  just don't have an MRI......  ouch
515496,hammercarp,2010-10-28 10:27:00,964,"I think you have to look at it this way. Yes that fish may die. But by throwing that individual fish back you are in fact protecting the resource from being pillaged by the unscrupulous who would use the excuse that it was going ""die anyway"" to keep OOS catches and fish protected by slot size restrictions. It would be just too easy to get away with or even fake it."

At the weigh in the fish is doing fine and the jig is laying in the bottom of my livewell. This has happened so often to me that it doesn't suprise me anymore.

515554,charlesn,2010-10-28 13:47:00,551,"Is it just me or have you guys/gals not caught a bunch of fish with the hook almost being passed out of the anus?  I don't think the hook dissolves these days, but I have seen MANY occasions where the fish passes the hook/jig through their system.  Basically 50-90% of the hook and all of the line will be hanging out the butt when the fish is caught and the fish is otherwise very healthy.  What I assume in those cases is that the fish was gut hooked the person cut the line and the fish survived long enough to pass the bait and line through their system.  Have seen it with both smallies and largies.  I don't target anything else, but I've seen it with pike too.  The line and hook is usually coated by a mucous or algae, so it is obviously a time consuming process, but it does work and the fish appears no worse for wear.  Sometime the tube is still in tact and I learn a new colour to try - lol.  One thing for sure - when a big smallie is on the feed, you could have the world's fastest reflexes and most sensitive fingers, it doesn't matter, it can have a tube swallowed to the point where you see nothing but line heading down the fishes throat.  It is a gut-churning feel, but you aren't retrieving that bait without killing the fish for sure and from what I've seen - those fish will pass the bait - at least some will, so I cut the line and hope for the best.  I have tanked a few and had the occasional one regurgitate a tube jig that I otherwise could not retrieve without harming the fish, but that is a rarity.  Usually it just gets swallowed deeper and deeper.  Charles"
515375,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 00:33:00,70,"I've seen this for the last time on a fishing show! It's really starting to irritate me... I was watching a fishing show the other day , won't mention the name of the show but they caught a Largemouth Bass and the lure was logged in the fishs mouth... They said we are gonna cut the line and the hook will rott out. That is what I can say pure bull ! Just this year I have two times where I can prove that this is not true !! One of those times is I caught a 15"" walleye and kept it as a eater, when I cleaned it I noticed something weird in his belly so I opened him up. What did I see was two 1/4oz jigs in his stomach!! The bait that was on the jigs where long gone nothing was in the stomach except those jigs, I'm surprised it didn't puncture his stomach but after a while I'm sure it would have. The worst part is that the jigs still looked like brand new with no corrosion at all! Who knows how long they have been in there! One more example is that I went fishing with one of my buddy's on a saturday and he got his line cut off at one time, we didn't think anything of it. The next saturday , exactly 7 days later I returned to the exact spot and was I was fishing for walleye and I caught one about 16"" long. When I got the fish in the boat I noticed something logged in his throat ? I looked it at it closely and it was the jig my friend lost the weekend before !! It was hooked right in the throat and I know it was my friends jig from a week before because I gave him that jig to fish with , so I remembered the size and the color. I decided to remove it and it still looked like brand new no sign of corrosion at all and we're talking about a week later??? Obviously this walleye would of died it couldn't eat , it had a jig in it's throat!  If ever you have a fish with a hook logged deep inside him and you want to cut the line and release it, my tip of advice is don't leave the hook in him! If you can't remove the hook safely just keep the fish and have yourself a snack! There's nothing wrong with keeping some fish for eating, even if your a catch and release guy and you never keep fish or just hate to eat fish. Find someone who loves to eat fish like a relative or a friend, someone would enjoy eating fresh fish I know I would!! Don't let your fish suffer with a hook logged in him , would you like to have a hook logged in your throat ? I know I wouldn't !!  It's awesome to catch and release but don't make your fish suffer !"

515386,Dozer,2010-10-28 00:52:00,896,"Maybe crap quality hooks rust quicker than the better ones  There was a jig stuck on my uncles dock for a month, came out but not without a hard twist and pull."
515391,spinnerbaitking,2010-10-28 01:07:00,1622,"DEEP BREATHES, DEEP BREATHES, IT'LL BE ok, some times you just have to leave the hooks in lol Richard "
515398,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 01:14:00,70,  The fish dosen't have a chance if the hook is logged in his throat or stomach? Would u survive if you would have a hook logged in your throat?
515411,Terry,2010-10-28 01:33:00,14456,"fish and people are to very different things so you can not use that as an argument  I am not a fish but I did swallow a nickel ....so far so good, I am glad they didn't cook me..  everything I read/ everything I have been told says they do dissolve.....  if I think a legal fish is going to die I will keep it of course  but again I do not think that your fish with2 jigs in it's stomach even left the water so the fisherman couldn't do anything"
515414,danc,2010-10-28 01:45:00,4677,"This will be a problem as long as fishing, the way it is, exists. As Terry mentioned, there's no choice when the fish is out of season, or out of the slot. I'm not sure what the lesson is supposed to be here."
515417,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 01:50:00,70,"  Yes i know the hooks in the stomach the fisherman probably didn't know thats not why i brought up that , my point is that they don't disolve.. It's bull! I've read it in this summer's issue of ontario of outdoors and i've seen it with my own eyes that they don't. If they do it takes a awfull long time for them to disovle !"
515418,Nipfisher,2010-10-28 01:50:00,2449,A.J.F. That was my coloured jig you found. I am 100% sure of it. Where were you fishing lol.
515421,Joey,2010-10-28 01:51:00,9122," Well you are right, that fish did not survive"
515423,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 01:53:00,70,"This is my opinion and sorry i'm not making a fish suffer ... They don't disovle it's just the facts, and for slot size fish and out of season fish well it's your call if you wanna keep it or not. One tip of advice is don't wait hours to set the hook !!! And i'm far from a poacher but if i catch a slot size walleye and it will die i'm sorry but i'm gonna keep it! I've told it to the M.N.R's on my region that I will ... It never happend yet hope it dosent happend but if it does , it's not gonna go to waste for seagulls !"
515425,ctdd2006,2010-10-28 02:02:00,531," I love fish, care for the fish and our resources...but I also love my boat, equipment and my money....around here a deep hooked wally in the slot becomes animal food.  Sorry!  I hear what you're saying, but consequences can be harsh!"
515426,danc,2010-10-28 02:04:00,4677, Here's some better advice if deep hooking a fish concens you. Fish barbless and don't use live bait. That's what I do. I haven't had a deep hooked or unreleasable fish in over a decade.  A good example here.  
515427,Gerritt,2010-10-28 02:05:00,6129,"Wow,,, you have opened a huge can of worms here.. prepare to be educated.  G"
515430,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 02:09:00,70,  Do you know that it's against the Law to waste a gamefish also?? So it can be quite the argument !! So if your fish dies  you can be charged !
515431,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 02:10:00,70,  It never happend to me but the thought of fishing shows promoting this kind of behavior is awfull...
515433,BillM,2010-10-28 02:13:00,17367," You are playing with fire man, if it's out of the slot it goes back, if it's out of season it goes back..  Regardless if the hook is down it's throat or not."
515434,mercman,2010-10-28 02:14:00,7054,  and its also illegal to keep a slot sized fish.What a predicament...........................................................................
515435,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-28 02:15:00,1107, I brought this up before and looked at they ask a CO site and they said if the fish is OOS or in a slot you will be charged if it's in your posession .I beleive it is to stop poachers from keeping what ever they want by just saying they were deep hooked and would have died .I thought the same thing but I was wrong and can admit it
515437,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 02:19:00,70,"  Hey i love the slot size and really beleive in it and I've never kept one before but if it's gonna die sorry but I killed it I'm taking full responsibility for the fish, If i get charged or not. It's not like I would have 50 fish 20 of them in the slot I would only have one fish... I would bring it to court no problem, Sorry but my fish is not going to seagulls !"
515438,ctdd2006,2010-10-28 02:21:00,531, I guess it depends which you'd rather debate in court.  If you release a fish with the intention/hope of it living... are you not only doing what you are supposed to do legally?(seagulls or hawks or any other animals need to eat too...circle of life...ecosystems?) The alternative...do you take on the argument that that slot sized fish in your live well or on your stringer is only there cuz a knuckle ball jig went too deep down his yap and you felt sorry for it and felt it better to release it to a pan of grease?  I'm not saying your intentions are immoral or necessarily wrong...only illegal.
515441,danc,2010-10-28 02:24:00,4677, Fishing shows can't keep fish caught out of season or the slot either. Perhaps thats why they do it??
515445,mercman,2010-10-28 02:30:00,7054,  very noble of you.i admire your conviction.but i would not risk my boat tackle and my hard earned money on a fish that might die and fulfill its destiny in life. to nourish another living thing in the food chain. the way i see it anyways.
515446,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-28 02:30:00,70," I know exactly what your saying but seagulls I feed them my chips when im on the lake lol Like i said in other reply's I've never kept one illegally before but If i Kill a fish its my fault and i would feel bad leaving it to float there , it's my doing   Legal or not I would feel wrong leaving it there and to my mind it's considered as wasting and wasting in my mind is wrong in any way ... If it feels wrong Sorry but I can't do it that fish is coming with me and i'll be happy to know that it's been carefully cared for and not wasted... My mind would be at ease   I'm always pissed when fisherman around here talk about how they caught over there limit of fish and kept everything and kept lots in the slot I'm against that tottally and always will be i hate fisherman who do that   I always release slots and sometimes i go fishing and don't even bring back a fish, I only catch and release on some days I only keep some for the dinner table from time to time... I even release the big ones over the slot that are ""LEGAL"" lots of friends that come with me get pissed off at me because i release big fish , but i think about the future if i kill this fish this fish might be carrying thousands of eggs and i'lll be killing thousands of fish!!   I don't wanna argue with anyone this is just my opinion you guys do what you want , I just beleive it's wrong to leave your own fish floating there sorry its just how i feel ..."
