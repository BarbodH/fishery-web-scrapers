515450,mercman,2010-10-28 02:35:00,7054,  you actually did that  Me too !!! it must be a genetic thing
515462,cram,2010-10-28 02:53:00,1733,"I have no issue with a .05 limit if that is where we're impaired (which is interesting...i didn't know we actually were)  I do have an issue with the imposition of a false-law (or at least that's my understanding).  If you blow the new limit, you lose your license for a few days....BUT, there is no charge???   As in, its not really illegal to be driving at 0.05 but there are new stiffer penalties for blowing the warning level.  Am I misunderstanding it?  Is there an actual charge/fine for the new limit aside from getting your license reinstated?  The part that DOES bug me though -- there are some real DRUNKS who seem to get caught drinking and driving a few times and through the legal system continuously get off.  Guys who are totally smashed getting off.   So, the truly guilty get off and the warning-level guys are penalized."
515466,fishing n autograph,2010-10-28 03:02:00,2540,"ok, i've clarified this a couple of times on the board over the year and a bit that the ""new"" .05 has been around.......  The PROVINCIAL LAW aka the Highway Traffic Act has ALWAYS had the automatic licence suspension from .05-.08.....for the longest time the penalty was a 12 hour suspension that was not tracked...so every weekend you could get hammered, have your licence suspended for 12 hours and when you sobered up you came to the station and picked up your licence....now, if you're caught it's 3 days and it's tracked. Like i have said many times, i've caught the same people 5 times on 12 hour suspensions....and nothing seems to sink in.  And as for impaireds getting off...it's completely at the court level. A impaired case is more technical and complex than any murder trial and most crowns will tell you they would rather deal with a serious sexual assault than an impaired. For defence lawyers, impaired driving is where they make the money. Not only that, there is so much stupid case law that we have to deal with when we come to court that it's now the arresting officer on trial not the drunk..."
515468,fishing n autograph,2010-10-28 03:08:00,2540,"My problem is that the court believes everything the drunk driver says....the carter defence came about because a guy got his friend to say at court that he only had 2 drinks and the fact that he blew .200 was impossible and the judge believed him...the   fyi....when the insurance co. sees a 90 day adls suspension for blowing over .08 the drunk driver's insurance skyrockets....3 day, not so much...."
515473,cram,2010-10-28 03:32:00,1733,"  Is there an actual charge/fine in addition to the suspension?  Is 0.05 now a DUI?  My admittedly uninformed understanding of it --- I always thought the 12 hr thing was a ""warning"" because at .05 or above you're dangerously close to .08 and could be on the way there (as the alcohol is digested).  So the new rules weren't really a new ""impaired"" level but just new penalties enforced at the ""warning"" level....hence the issue.  That said, it was always just my understanding and nothing other than hearsay to base it on.  I've never actually had a 12 hr or a DUI  (or a 3 day/90 day)"
515479,fishing n autograph,2010-10-28 03:41:00,2540,"no, for the first offence its a straight 3 day suspension...second offence its 7 days and counselling, 3 time its a 30 day, counselling and I think either a fine or probation...can't remember  No the legal limit is .08. However, in my opinion I think the legal limit is .05...so ya, the new penalty is at the warn level...and to complicate the who issue, the roadside is calibrated at .100mg/100mL...so when you blow a warn, you are blowing between .05 and .100...so you could be over the legal limit"
515481,cram,2010-10-28 03:46:00,1733,"If 0.05 is impaired I just wish they'd say 0.05 is impaired, so that's the new limit.  Above that you're charged.  Make it simple.  Otherwise it seems like a hokey way to punish people who aren't actually impaired.  Or, punish the multiple offenders above .05....i can understand there's a problem if someone is getting multiples."
515486,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-28 04:17:00,0,WAAAAAAy back when. You could drive around with a case in the front seat and they'd just make you put it in the trunk if you were pulled over. Now it's just easier if you don't drink at all....lol
515488,blarg,2010-10-28 04:47:00,289,"Anything less than making .05 (or whatever number, 0 for all I care) the only legal limit is just garbage.  Personally I think the only reason we don't have an actual hard limit lower than .08 is for the betterment of businesses that sell alcohol, if saving lives was really that important the concerns of a restaurant of bar owner wouldn't be considered all that highly.  Making excuses for this intermediate limit is hard for me to swallow.  If we now have to track anyone from .05-.08 and now have to have that available to our insurers and suspend our licenses for 3 days when we are ""caught"", then please tell us why the law isn't simply .05, period. It is either dangerous, or it isn't, the way the law is currently written should be unconstitutional, I should not be subject to punishment for something that is almost illegal."
515497,fishing n autograph,2010-10-28 10:44:00,2540," actually, i agree with you. The criminal code limit should be .05 100% because, physiologically you are impaired at .05mg/100mL. Now remember, there's a difference between impaired and intoxicated."
515498,fishing n autograph,2010-10-28 10:45:00,2540," you can still drive with a case in your front seat. according to the liquor licence act as long as a seal on the bottle isn't broken, it's fine"
515499,fishing n autograph,2010-10-28 10:46:00,2540,"  well it's not unconstitutional and if you look at it, it's two separate laws and two separate acts the HTA and the Criminal code. It's absolute liability and it's not different than a health inspector shutting down a restaurant after a failed inspection"
515504,Daplumma,2010-10-28 11:20:00,1961,Now if they could only come up with a field test for the pot heads.Then they could legalize it and tax the crap out of it.It would get the 45 mph guy groovin in the fast lane off the road. Joe
515506,fishing n autograph,2010-10-28 11:24:00,2540,"Yup, they have the standarsized field sobriety test....once they perform poorly they get hooked up for impaired by drug and droppeo off to a drug recognition officer"

515538,cram,2010-10-28 13:19:00,1733,"Still seems like losing your license for going 80 in a 100 zone.....you're almost at the legal limit, so we're going to suspend you.  Oh, and without a trial.  And, the guy who gets caught doing 140km in that same zone....3 or 4 times, keeps getting off when they go to trail.  The nearly guilty get punished, without at trial.  The truly guilty get off, when they go to trail.  Just make it STIFF penalties for the real offenders instead.  Would be much more effective."
515571,thalweg,2010-10-28 15:14:00,112,"What I find surprising is that .08 is a substantial level of alcohol in your system. When they say most people don't notice, I find that hard to believe.  .08 and thats a really good buzz in my opinion."
515820,blarg,2010-10-29 05:58:00,289," Generally tests only have one pass/fail line, this is ridiculous policy.  So the restaurant can be shut down when it almost fails the test? Bull"
515829,fishing n autograph,2010-10-29 10:26:00,2540," ummm, not sure what you're not getting... .05-.079 is a FAIL under the PROVINCIAL LAW.....anything above .08 is a CRIMINAL OFFENCE under the FEDERAL LAW"
515854,cram,2010-10-29 13:41:00,1733," Yeah but there's no charge or fine, right??  In terms of actual charge, getting caught doing a rolling stop or going 20km over the speed limit carries a charge and fine.  Why not this, if its a law?  I'm sure there's a reason behind it, but to the layperson it seems like a big pile of hokey."
515297,fishing n autograph,2010-10-27 21:17:00,2540,"Hey all, i'm not here to preach or start anything....  I've recently been doing some training and have had the chance to watch an awesome video produced by the Center of Forensic Science in Toronto. The study was conducted in 1958 prior to the 0.08mg/100mL was put into the criminal code.  The study is by a doctor (long since dead) who's basis of the testing was stating that perhaps Canada should follow Norway's lead with impaired driving laws. In Norway, since 1925, the legal limit has been .110mg/100mL. His research took 10 of the best race/rally car drivers in Ontario and subjected them to tests. The basis being that race car drivers are trained drivers and are used to the pressures of being tested for various things. They thought that the average driver would be too nervous for the tests.  The drivers than completed a series of driving tests including weaving in and out of cones both forwards and in reverse, taking a turn at high speed (60mph) adjusting to emergency braking (kid running onto the road), stopping at a red light, turning at a stop sign and adjusting to a sudden detour. The drivers were sober and had to drive quickly, smoothly and obey the rules of the road.  Once they completed the test, they started to drink.  8 males and 2 females began to drink. The theory, is that the average male will reach .080mg/100mL after 6-8 standard 1.5oz shots (mixed drinks) over 4 hours.  They then completed the tests. The range of blood alcohol contents were between .035mg and .110mg/100mL. (the course was set up on the old Jarvis Airport tarmac)  They showed each driver completing the test. Each and every ""professional"" driver could not complete any of the tasks properly. Their speeds either drastically increased or decreased. The driver who had the BAC of .110 ended up goin 80mph through the track etc etc.  The study proved that at .040 a persons ability to drive IS IMPAIRED. Although a person may not feel intoxicated or show any signs of intoxication, their ability to react etc changes.  I'm still looking for the video because it's really well done. Anyway, the scientists were shocked and actually petitioned the governement in 1960 to have the legal limit lowered to .050mg/100mL.  For some on this board who have issues with the PROVINCIAL law of .050mg/mL, there are a lot of misconceptions. For example, I consumed 4, 1.5 oz of rye in coke over a 45 minute period and waited 15minutes to eliminate the traces of mouth alcohol. I only blew .044 (my highest result) and honestly, I didn't feel any different than I did cooking at the bbq on a summer day. 2 beers will not cost you a 3 day suspension....unless you have them in 30mins or less then drive. The majority of the horror stories you hear are either false or caused by a result called mouth alcohol which basically is the remnants of what you drank that stays in your mouth 15mins after your last sip.  The average person's rate of elimination is 10-20 mg of alcohol from your body every hour. So, for us guys, the average bottle of beer has 17mgs of alcohol in it. So do the math....you have 2 beers, after an hour or so it will be out of your system. I'm not telling you to go out and drink, but if you do...take your time, have some food and don't rush. The laws are in place for a reason (i don't agree with them all) but the impaired driving laws are accurate. Studies have shown that from .05-.100 the average person feels euphoria, disinhibition, increased self confidence, impaired judgement, slight loss of coordination and the inability to complete divided attention tasks like driving lol....seasoned drinkers have a greater tolerance for alcohol and may be able to keep it together but there is a point where every person won't be able to react fast enough for the change in the routine and for those who drive in Toronto and Markham those changes can be difficult when sober.  Anyways, just thought i'd pass some information on. I know i'm going to get flack for everything but educating people is a good thing and sometimes it saves a life. I know that i won't be getting behind the wheel after a few beers anymore.  Dave"

515353,fishing n autograph,2010-10-27 23:57:00,2540,"Paul its not the intolerance to alcohol that causes it...if you are a chronic alcoholic your BAC is always high and those three beers add to it whch puts your into alcohol amnesia...its the functional tolerance of alcohol that's dangerous....the guys who are in such a bad state that their BAC is always over the limit but they walk, talk, work and do many single tasks well, but when they do something that involves divided attention like driving then there's problems!"
