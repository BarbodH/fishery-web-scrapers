515693,denisk,2010-10-28 21:30:00,163,"NIAGARA OUTDOOR OPENâ€¦due to the forecast for Sat. (high winds!!!) we have re-scheduled for Sunday Oct.31. This should make the day safer and more enjoyable for all those involved. This change will especially help people who are towing longer distances. Hopefully, this early notification will afford competitors a better opportunity to manage their weekend timetable. All other times remain in effect. If you know someone that plans to fish this tourney, let them know that it will be on Sunday. Any questions, please call Denis @ 905-871-3888 from 10am til 5pm on Fri. or Sat. or visit fishinniagara.com"
