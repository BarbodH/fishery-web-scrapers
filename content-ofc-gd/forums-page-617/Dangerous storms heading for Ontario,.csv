514989,Carp,2010-10-26 17:47:00,1488,I was just thinking the same thing Brian. I'm leaving this Sunday for a week of deer hunting. Hope everything passes before the hunt and doesn't return until afterwards. Last couple of years we've been lucky as the weather was great all week long during the deer hunt. What are the chances we can make it 3 years in a row ?
