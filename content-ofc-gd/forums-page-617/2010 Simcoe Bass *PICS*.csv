Filling early orders for laker takers and the up coming ice season.  I'm itching for this wind to pass through and get back on the water, I figured I'd add some fish porn for everyone to have a gander at during these hard times, lol.  Next week looks mint!  Hoping to be on the water lots! This is the best time of year to land those giant smallies!   clients with a nice double header!  Giant almost 7 in July!  nice day!  Good day with dad!  Happy client!  Kelli learning the art of the dropshot  Another happy client  Good day out with good friends  Nice one!  Kelli's PB @ 6lbs 13oz  Nice tournament bag  Pig  Some nice bronze    Oh man I cant wait for next week!!!"
515729,steverowbotham,2010-10-28 23:10:00,1800,I should add that dropshotting became a big part of my success this year.  I never realized until this season how crucial a dropshot is in my tackle selection.  Strike Zone slammers made by our board member Mark Kulik put A LOT of fish in my boat this year!
