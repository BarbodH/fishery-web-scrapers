514429,Cookslav,2010-10-24 13:18:00,1457,"Be strong for your wife, and stay positive....Cancer treatment has come a long way. My uncle went to the Mayo clinic 3 years ago with terminal Brain cancer, and lung cancer as the primary. The refered him to another clinic in Minesota who's name escapes me right now to undergo a new treatment called ""Gamma Knife"" sugery.  Its lazer based, and no actual incisions are made. The sugery was considered 100% successfull, and he is now 3 years cancer free. Whats crazy is they said ""if"" it popps up again to simply come back down to the clinic and they will retreat him....they are slowly turning the most agressive Cancers from a Terminal desease into a potentiallt chronic illness....Amazing stuff, and I can't wait for the day we see this Treatment in Canada....its comming, and the system is already in several Ontario hospitals, but has not been approved for use yet. My Uncles new mission in life is to bring this system to Canada in a not for profit enviroment, and is working hard through a lot of red tape to Make this happen.  But IMO....why wait? It costs money as OHIP does not cover american systems, But in some cases Money can buy you happiness and health. I'm not a docotor, but if you don't like what your doctor has to say it may be something to look at. I wouldn't recomend publicly it if I had not seen the results myself.  I don't have the exact contact info for the clinic, but I can surely get it for you if you like. Just send me a PM  Take care,"
