516056,AzuluSpookd,2010-10-30 03:01:00,348,I woulda helped ya.....but.....lol
516057,irishfield,2010-10-30 03:03:00,26272,Hey... you can't even help yourself right now to pee... lol 
516060,AzuluSpookd,2010-10-30 03:12:00,348,Good point!
516063,Guest gbfisher,2010-10-30 03:17:00,0,did ya slip with the knife gutting that animal marty?

512219,irishfield,2010-10-16 01:12:00,26272,"UUGGGHHHH !!!  I don't mind doing this so much when it's a paying customer.... but this is my own machine! I'd much rather be fishing on a friday afternoon, that's for sure.  They don't make fuel like they use to... exhaust valve guides shot after 215 hours. Clearance is like throwing a wiener down a hallway.   "
512222,vinnimon,2010-10-16 01:17:00,2593,"Dont feel bad Wayne! Im in the same boat! What im doing to prevent any stress is go fishing first, for relax time then go at her!Engine that is!"
512223,Roy,2010-10-16 01:19:00,13728,"I know you love that kinda stuff, Wayne. It's all Greek to me though."
512234,HTHM,2010-10-16 02:26:00,4082,You bragging or complaining?
512236,irishfield,2010-10-16 02:29:00,26272,..about my wiener?
512237,danc,2010-10-16 02:29:00,4677,I don't know Wayne. They look fine to me. I think that perhaps you were just a little bored.

512248,Raf,2010-10-16 03:03:00,3495,have you tried buffing that out?
512250,irishfield,2010-10-16 03:24:00,26272,"That's about how it works Raf. New valve guides and we'll ""buff"" them to size! lol  Tomorrow I'm gonna change the oils in the Verado and Kicker, winterize the plumbing and get the boat ready for Muskie hunting!"
512259,Terry,2010-10-16 09:16:00,14456,maybe you can just slap a VW motor on that thing LOL

512284,aplumma,2010-10-16 14:59:00,6896,Did they start adding Ethanol to avgas??? or is it the lower sulfur?? that seems not near enough hours to burn exhaust guides. I have never seen/worked with aircraft motors but in diesel language it seems like a short time. I am sure you will get it straighted out and back together quick enough.  Art
512286,irishfield,2010-10-16 15:06:00,26272,"Art, the old WWII technology is designed to run on 80/87.. which has about 5 times less lead in it than the 100LL that we can only get now. 100LL has about 15 times the lead in it that our LEADED regular car fuel use to have. It's the extra lead that causes valve sticking and erosion. The guides don't really get burnt, they just get worn away until they get so sloppy the valve stem can coc k and break.   I hate the smell of car gas in an airplane, but I'm thinking I'm going to have to go that way and use premium and lead additive to create something similar to the 80/87. Just becomes a PITA constantly checking fuel sources for ethanol before filling the jugs/aircraft fuel tank. As ethanol is an absolute no no in an aircraft and it's sealed fuel tanks."
512334,OhioFisherman,2010-10-16 19:03:00,6623,LOL are those jugheads?
515816,irishfield,2010-10-29 04:03:00,26272,"Well I made the right call pulling them all off and it's the best $1200 I ever spent. It was going to be a WHOLE LOT MORE expensive if I let it go for a few more hours... as it was going to be catastrophic!        Now to put ""humpty"" back together again, now that the cylinders/valves are all redone."
515871,Gerritt,2010-10-29 14:28:00,6129,I would say good call Wayne!

515937,Terry,2010-10-29 17:47:00,14456,yeah real good call  but you should be muskie fishing instead
515945,fishnsled,2010-10-29 18:11:00,3520, Agreed.  It looks like a great winter project.  Since it's still fall...go   Nice to know that you'll be around for a while and didn't leave this repair until it was too late.
