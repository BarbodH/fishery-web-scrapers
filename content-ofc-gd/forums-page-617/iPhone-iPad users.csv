It is a tournament series that requires you to win money to un-lock new lakes and target species. The actual weights of fish and methods to catch them are a bit skewed but fun none the less.  Here are some examples.  In the game I have caught catfish and carp on top water baits...what the hell?  I have won tourneys with over 150 lbs of pike on 3 fish.  I have also landed several 20+ pound walleye.  Man I wish it was real."
515886,Gerritt,2010-10-29 15:39:00,6129, I saw it was released Oct 8th?   I will look for ifishing as well! thanks!
