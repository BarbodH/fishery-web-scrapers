516165,fishinguypat,2010-10-30 18:19:00,547,they can cross the niagara but 6 years ago at the grand i saw a dead deer on  the shore of the water...it was a deep section though
516168,Raf,2010-10-30 18:33:00,3495,here's my contribution to the mammals in water theme  
516239,fishing_noob,2010-10-30 23:37:00,12, woah what what the hell was this taken at the whirlpool cuz thats one brave deer lol
515906,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-10-29 16:45:00,76,"This shows how tough these animals really are !  Anyone who has fished the lower niagara river knows that it would almost be certain death if someone tried to swim across it, especially up near the glen or whirlpool.  While shore fishing we noticed something out in the middle...and it seemed to be coming towards us, making its way around the steady flow of boats drifting down the river. Next thing you know a whitetail pops up out of the river and goes straight up the steep bank behind us. Not something you see everyday that is for sure. I wonder if customs stopped it to check its passport ??   "
515908,SRT8 smoker craft,2010-10-29 16:51:00,1107,Wow what a cool experience thanks for sharing it!!!

515915,Headhunter,2010-10-29 17:04:00,5703,Nice pic and story! I didn't know that deer liked marshmellows! HH
515916,Bondar,2010-10-29 17:07:00,817,"HAHA you too eh !!! I found its mate, this was last saturday down there This deer too eventually got to the Canadian side and climbed up into the glen "
515925,blaque,2010-10-29 17:25:00,2419,"HAH?! How the heck can those little toothpick legs propel them to swim at all let alone across the lower niagara. Im perplexed, seriously lol  Gumption would be an understatement."
515928,dobee,2010-10-29 17:30:00,301,wow..thats cool! - think they would hit an apple jig?
515932,xkempx,2010-10-29 17:41:00,84,"I was hitting Golf balls at Deer Ridge Golf Club, Two big bucks WALK across the range while hitting ball....But this Ive never seen...Cool photo guys"
515935,POLLIWOGG,2010-10-29 17:45:00,835,I saw one a couple miles out in LO.
515941,rippinlipsfishingteam,2010-10-29 17:54:00,76,"Jeff, looks like the same deer ! hahaha.....maybe its the safest spot considering hunting season is coming up !"
515959,Bondar,2010-10-29 19:09:00,817,"   that one in my picture was actually swimming up current and making some good distance , he got out about 100 yards up river from where i was standing, i couldnt believe how well it swam either in that water"
515960,mercman,2010-10-29 19:25:00,7054,  MINN KOTA   need i say more  excellent shots.
515972,Joey,2010-10-29 20:14:00,9122,"Wow, that is so neat, never would I have imagined they'd be strong enough to swim across there!!!  Joey"
515997,tb4me,2010-10-29 21:35:00,3295,cool thanks for posting..amazing stuff..
516019,farsider,2010-10-30 00:32:00,456,"Cool Pics.  I have actually seen the aftermath when they don't make it all the way across. Naturally removes the weak from the herd. Cheers, Mark"
516040,crappieperchhunter,2010-10-30 01:44:00,2582,Years ago on a fly in out of Chapleau we spotted something out in the bay while we where eating our breakfast and planning our day. Jumped in the boats and motored out to have a look. A big cow moose at least a mile from the closest shore just swimming along. We circled her for awhile and got some pictures and then left her alone. She was really moving. The wake she was making made it look like she had a 6HP motor strapped to her behind. She proceeded to swim at least another 2 miles to a point farther away from our camp before she got out of the water.  Very powerfull swimmer.I imagine a deer would be the same.  Thx for your post. Brought back a memory from a very good trip.
516117,canadadude,2010-10-30 14:40:00,769,"I've seen them swimming across the upper from Navy Island, but not on the lower, thats amazing the deer population is exploding around this area"
516122,canadadude,2010-10-30 14:47:00,769,"a few get swept over the falls every year around this time. I have a friend that witnessed it once, she said it was one of the most horrible things she's seen.According to the parks police every year they get reports of deer getting swept over, I guess it's part of nature."
516125,Gman,2010-10-30 15:37:00,126,"Cool, I can't believe they made it across.  Absolutely incredible!  Thanks for sharing.  Cheers G."
516127,danc,2010-10-30 15:45:00,4677,That's pretty cool for sure. A couple of years ago I rounded a corner on the Nipigon River and saw two Moose swimming downstream towards me. I couldn't believe it when they turned around and started swimming upstream away from me. This is water where a 9.9 hp outboard will barely move you upstream. Nature never ceases to amaze!!    
516131,asdve23rveavwa,2010-10-30 16:00:00,2690,"Some really cool photos, guys.  It is pretty darn amazing that those deer can make it across that river."
516149,solopaddler,2010-10-30 17:40:00,8605,Homeland security and Canada border patrol beware. You're gonna have a flood of smugglers and illegal aliens dressed up in deer suits going for a little swim.  
516151,fishinguypat,2010-10-30 17:45:00,547,why get a boat when you could just use a deer?
516154,steverowbotham,2010-10-30 17:55:00,1800,Thats awesome!
