At this time of the year (fall) I usually catch my biggest fish. A couple 34 inchers every fall. All fish are catch at dusk or later at night. No competition here as most people here do not fish at night. Last night was very strange.  It was cold and dark by 7:00 pm. The fishin got very slow and  casting to my usual spots stoppped producing. My buddy and i were shooting the breeze and I just let my minnow dangle in the water no more than a foot from shore and about a foot of water. I felt a small weight and bang a 10 inch walleye.  Let that go. Dropped the dead minnow back to the same spot and bang,  a nice 15 incher. WE only had 4 minnows left but it didn't make a difference. Dead or alive , a foot or so from the shore and we were catching fish. I tried casting jigs and grub and then small rapalas (both usually produce) and nothing. Hook on a mushed up minnow and hold it in front of you a couple of feet from shore and wham a, another one. The biggest one was about 28 inches long and the smallest was about 6 inches long. All in all we landed 11 walleye and lost a bunch.  Never seen anything like it in my life. We shined a flashlight into the water but didn't see a thing. One of the weirdest days I ever had.  I'm gonna try it again to night (it's raining pretty hard right now) if it stops raining.  muddler"
514484,Leecher,2010-10-24 19:50:00,7832,That is weird indeed muddler     but sounds like fun catching them a foot away or so from shore Thanks for sharing Leechman
514496,daryl0815,2010-10-24 21:27:00,225,"That is strange, but I have heard of walleye coming in to shallow areas like boat launches at night to feed, but I have never seen it for myself!"
514501,AverageJoeFishing,2010-10-24 21:53:00,70,"Walleye is one of the most unpredictable fish there is... You never know what these fish will do? One day they can be in 6 foot of water with weeds, the next day the can be in 40 feet of water on deep drop offs. You gotta try everything and i mean everything to catch walleye !"
514518,tknohpy,2010-10-24 23:19:00,162,"That must have been where the food was, walleyes follow their bellies"
514656,Garnet,2010-10-25 15:12:00,2056,Normally the frog migration is in Sept. You will see them all over the roads. At this time walleye will be extremely shallow.
514764,Rod Caster,2010-10-25 21:44:00,5784,"I've caught some walleye in rice lake in under 3feet of water, mid day. Grateful said it best...they follow their bellies!  Exciting though, huh?  "
515412,chong,2010-10-28 01:37:00,102,"When fall comes I fish alot at night 9pm-3am,walleyes comes into shallow water to feed any where from 1'-5' of  water. Caught my PB at night 7lbs."
