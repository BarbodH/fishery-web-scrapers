515347,timmeh,2010-10-27 23:42:00,609,Time has come for a new pair of breathable waders as the old ones have been repaired one time too many now. Curious as to any opinions on redington waders?

I read all sorts of recommendations on here and elsewhere about mail order but ended up going to BPS (the lower end Redingtons seem to be at a similar price point to the White River ones I ended up buying) and trying lots of different pairs on, much easier and enjoyable than trekking back and forth from the post office.  Your profile doesn't say where you are but there are two redington dealers in Misssisauga, whether they'll have what you want in your size is another matter. http://www.redington.com/dealer_locator.php?country=CA&state=ON&zip=&Submit.x=13&Submit.y=4"

If you want to updgrade and buy a pair of waders to last you several years spend the cash and get a pair of Simms or check out the new Bare Waders that are coming out shortly..."
