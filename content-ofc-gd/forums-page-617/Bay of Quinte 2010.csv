514706,mike rousseau,2010-10-25 18:40:00,4661,took my first trip to BOQ on saturday...very interesting fishing  i managed to get one walleye 5lbs ...missed one... and lost one...  i was pretty down on myself for only getting one walleye... till i read the reports for this weekend  in the end it was still pretty sweet to get my first planner board walleye...altho i didnt really get to see my homemade tattle flag go down because it took the hole board down (nice)...and i felt like i found a good area considering we had action on three fish in a very small area... hopefully i can get back up there late november/early december and have better success.
514709,Terry,2010-10-25 18:42:00,14456,nice going   I can't wait to get down there fishing too
515169,superdad,2010-10-27 11:55:00,353,"Mike  If at first you don't succeed - come fishing again.  The fishing has been tough, but some people have solved the puzzle.  Cheers"
515173,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-10-27 12:49:00,0, Don't feel so bad. I went out to Sturgeon for 4 hours and caught zero!!!You'll get em! But next time take some pictures!!!!
515268,mike rousseau,2010-10-27 19:12:00,4661,i will be back up later this year... i dont mind getting skunked for the chance at a trophy... i catch all the walleye i want on the st.lawrence river...good size too... its just hard to get bigger then ten pounds here...thought i had a 10lber last night night fishing with my girlfriend but it was only about 7.5-8...27 inches and she got a 3.5lber...  i was also wondering if anyone knows a nice flat boat launch for adolphus reach for later in the year when there might be ice?  the small launch i found was very steep and slipery in october...i cant imagine launching there in december... i would appreciate it... i dont mind having to drive a little further by truck or by boat to avoid sliding butt first into the BOQ lol
515269,mike rousseau,2010-10-27 19:15:00,4661, soory i dont normally take photos of walleye that are 5 pounds but i know a pic goes a long way on this site so when i go back to BOQ i'll take some more shots and i'll take a shot of the home made tattle flags i rigged up on my offshore boards...they turned out pretty sweet and work perfectly
515271,Headhunter,2010-10-27 19:21:00,5703,"Well, if it really needs to be flat, you may have some problems... There is a launch in Adolphus Town, but this time of year, with the water being so shallow, it's probably not gonna meet your needs... There is a launch in Bath, right near the power plant, but it is steep and can get quite harry should the wind blow up from any direction but north. You can launch at the ferry, but later in the year, it tends to freeze up... There is Prinyer's cove on the south shore of Adolphus Reach, but it is not maintained and will not have a dock... McFarlands conservation area, on the south shore, opposite the cement plant, but again, no dock and an early freeze up spot. Don't know if that helped, but what the heck! HH"
515276,mike rousseau,2010-10-27 19:35:00,4661,i dontt need much water...i have a 16 foot lund and roller bunks on my trailer so i only need a foot or two of water...i launched at macfarlands and i dont need a dock to launch but it was pretty steep and slick
515277,mike rousseau,2010-10-27 19:38:00,4661,or if there is a really nice launch that is a bit further away i can take up my dads ranger 620t and take a boat ride to the reach
515289,fish_fishburn,2010-10-27 20:53:00,1311,"I will be down there in 25 days, and your right Mike, don't mind getting skunked when your fishing for a trophy. I'm still trying for my first 15 lber. May never get it and who cares, but them 13's are pretty special. I think you are just a bit early for the big girls."
515291,OrangePeal,2010-10-27 21:00:00,37,"To avoid the icey ramps problems the ferry launch is the first one to try. With the grates it works fairly well. We launch in Picton but it is one of the first to ice up. Looking forward to the pic's of your homemade telltale flags.  Safe Fishing First, Jack"
515657,mike rousseau,2010-10-28 19:37:00,4661,"they can be done better but i had a hard time finding materials  ""offshore planer board home made tattle flag""   i used 19 gauge stainless steel wire...because i couldnt find ""piano wire"" you remove your rear eyebolt and screw it in the backside of the board...mine had holes in place already then you remove the nub of plastic that normaly holds your flag strait up then you need to remove the screw that holds the flag on and place several washers behind the flag and one in front of it then replace the screw then you need to secure the wire to the flag threw the hole and threw the eyebolt to a release clip...measure the disance because this determines how your flag will sit...you will want a bead between your hand twisted wire and back eyebolt... then you need to attach a spring from your flag to the pin holes in the front of your planer board...the lower the hole the higher the tension  i added 1oz sinkers to the front of my boards as well... i found this helped them run a bit nicer    any questions just ask..."
515842,Headhunter,2010-10-29 12:39:00,5703,"The launch at Hay Bay is reasonably flat... but some what of a distance to Adolphus... but if you are heading to Quinte in November ish, that area can be productive... but again, it's one of the early freeze up points. HH"
