I guess I want some direction on the compontents I should be looking at and that are compatable with each other  Budget is around $1000  I want to be able to do EVERYTHING a modern home theater PC should do... blu ray, blu ray burning, TV/recording, I have a pretty large collection of DVD's starting to build up and I would like to be able to have them stored on the computer so they are avaialble all the time !... I want to be able to use it for streaming music and videos online.... basically everything you would do on a normal computer... just with home theater capabilities HDMI/7.1&5.1 surround... Etc.  If anyone can help or point me in the direction of a good computer shop.... not like future shop or big box stores... that would be great !!  Thanks !"
