Might be better off just living with the plugs you have.  Sorry for all the caps but I really want to get the OP's attention on this matter.  Bob

515707,Bernie,2010-10-28 22:03:00,3190,"EC, I have had this discussion with the MTO guys. We had a seminar with them a couple years a go about this issue and other items. As a shop owner you could actually be fined by the MTO for forcing a customer to repair something that isn't part of the inspection. Even though you say it is up to you, it isn't according to them. You need to follow the regulations as per written. I even was warned that one of my inspections I repaired lights that were not part of the inspection and could be fined for doing so. The guy was an   but he was correct. I was our towns local fire inspector for a few years and went to courses on how to interpret the manual correctly. So if I am in doubt on an interpretation I read it through very carefully now. I agree with you though, it should be up to the technicians discretion as he is the professional. Their rebuttal is that not all techs are honest and they could go too far. The inspection book is definitely in serious need of an update. It is still written as if a car was still built in the 1960's."

515727,DanD,2010-10-28 23:03:00,2223,"Thanks Bernie Thats what I was trying to say; its not what we know as techs; its what the regs say, as to what we are allowed to do. Yes we can refuse to certify anything but we cannot charge for an inspection and then force repairs above the regs. I hate it at times and I document everything on my invoice that I have concerns with. Just like the lighting issue you mentioned; a vehicle under a certain length and width (most all light duty vehicles), only require high & low beam headlights and a license plate light and that's it. But a divers side window must be able to go down; so the driver can perform hand signals; theres nothing about the window having to go back up. So you have a vehicle with the window that doesnt operate (go down) smash it and now it passes????????? Talk about outdated regs. Sorry about hijacking the thread Mike. You still have a decent truck; fix her up to where you like her and have fun with it.  Dan."

The driver was fortunate the pails missed her, it could have been deadly."

Dodge = Worst Truck...this company didn't go bankrupt TWICE because of it's good vehicles  Ford  = Second Worst Truck...dog engines that either have spark plugs blow out or can't be removed  Chevy = Third Worst Truck...in my experience they don't stand behind their product...had to fight in order to get warranty issues corrected  And finally Toyota's new full size Tundra came out in Feb '07  Good Luck with your new future ride, Bob"

I once went 2 weeks with a Chevy Blazer waiting for a bent connecting rod to be repaired WITHOUT a loaner vehicle and was during the warranty period. All this time I had to beg for rides back and forth to work."

Personally, if i couldnt afford the insurance and gas I sure wouldnt to pay for the extras that will come along.  I didnt purchase my first vehicle until i was 27 for those reasons.  Just a thought.  buy the way...i have the 2002 version..i love it, but get ready for ""the incedentals""...they will show up!"

You will get some good use out of it yet but remember what the Gambler said....you can only repair so often then it might be time for a new lawn ornament.

516220,Dean Ellison,2010-10-30 22:20:00,39,"I had a 1998 F150 with the 4.6L. I recently sold it to my nephew. I crown rustproofed mine anually from new. I recommend the following.  Have it oil sprayed. Judging by the cancer (rust) already eating the body, I suspect your brake and fuel lines.  Inspect the tie rods ends (inner and outer), and the ball joints (upper and lower). I had to replace all of mine @120K  New wires,plugs,and coils may be needed. The engine may appear to be running great, but if any of these components are suspect, the engines' computer will compensate for these and lower your MPG.  K&N filter did little for me. Stick with the stock filter.  I installed a dual high flow exhaust which offered litle performance, but it sure sounds cool.  I wouldn't bother with the body work, just drive the piss out of it for a couple of years and save your money for gas and a newer F150.  Are those snow tires? You may need to buy some rubber.  Good luck, and congats on your ride."

Save your money for repairs (you will have some), body work and your next truck. Take this advise from a guy that has been there. Accessories do not give you much, if any, value. If more power is necessary, get a 5.4 liter in your next truck. But I bet you will find yours will have enough already to pull whatever you do."

Believe me I checked into this; when a customer that had purchased a vehicle with air bags that were deployed; I said it shouldn’t have been certified; boy did I end up with egg on my face. The Ministry was called in to check the vehicle and they quoted me this section of the regs. Schedule 1; The body work subsection (L) - if fitted with a seat belt assembly or assemblies, each belt anchorage shall be secure, each buckle and retractor shall operate as intended, and no belt webbing shall be visibly damaged so as to reduce its effectiveness.  There’s absolutely no mention in the safety regulations regarding the air bag system. Right or wrong; until the regulations are up dated, we cannot (or not supposed too) fail a vehicle for an air bag issue. We won’t even begin talking about ABS systems; because they also fall through the cracks and are not part of a safety inspection.  Dan."

I think you can see by what everyone has already said... drive it, spend your money of fishing gear... and besure to save some for un expected repairs.  DO NOT GET A TRANSMISSION FLUSH !!!! I know a few people that have down the ""flush"" as opposed to the ""fluid change"" and blew up trannys in a matter of a couple thousand kms after the job !!!

I'm not a ""engine"" guy but I love browsing parts and accessories so how about a little engine talk. I got a good deal on the truck so I'm willing to buy parts 1 at a time and get them put on....

515226,GBW,2010-10-27 16:49:00,8460,"Mike, to be honest, don't ""pimp"" it and save the $ for all the repair bills.  A cover is a good idea as it also saves a bit on gas when on the HWY."
515233,DanD,2010-10-27 17:27:00,2223,Here’s my 2 cents on this. Before doing anything else on the truck; get all the legal requirements looked into first. Safety inspection; even if it’s a “pre- safety” from an accredited safety inspection station; then you’ll know what’s required too meet minimum safety standards. Emission test; before you’ll be able to plate the vehicle you’ll need a past emissions test that has not expired. For transfer sake the test has to be with-in 1 year old; plate/sticker renewals the tests are good for 2 years. I have seen so many young people buy their first vehicle; spend a bunch of money on odds & ends; just to find out the thing needs hundreds of dollars of repairs to meet standards. Get it tested and checked for safety; then there won’t be any surprises.  Dan.

And don't waste your money on cold air intakes hoping to save on gas mileage...that is only a fairy tale.  Make that truck SAFE and reliable and you will be happy.  Bob"
515247,tb4me,2010-10-27 18:20:00,3295,"Id do all the maintainence (oil filter plugs ect ect), plate it, then worry bout the other things. A k&n air filter is a good investment a cold air intake is a better investment. Those triton motors can be hard on gas so the CAI will help with that a tad. other then that nice truck! The only thing she is missing is a HEMI! lol all kidding aside you will do alright.Congrats on the wheels!"
515248,craigdritchie,2010-10-27 18:21:00,1586,"I wouldn't sink a lot of money into a 10 year old truck - period. As others have said, do what's absolutely necessary to keep it running, and put that extra cash away for the inevitable surprise repairs and/or newer vehicle down the road.  Cheap, soft tonneau cover would be a worthwhile investment, just to keep your stuff dry. Otherwise, save your cash. Money spent on vehicles is basically money flushed down the toilet."
515250,Muskieman,2010-10-27 18:26:00,2472,"After the truck is ""Safe & Sound""  Best performance ""Bang for the Buck"" is a #1 Chip ""Edge Tuner"" 400.00 $ (more horses = fuel economy) #2 Jet Throttle Body Spacer( better fuel economy)125.00 $ #3 K&N Cold Air Intake 250.00 $(more air more power better economy) #4 Magnaflow Cat Back Exhaust 550.00 $ (what comes in must come out) #5 Royal Purple Synthetic Fluids all 'round 250.00 $(less friction & heat)  I have all of these on my 2000 Expedition 5.4 and wouldn't take any of them off. They have long since paid for themselves in fuel economy.  Randy "
