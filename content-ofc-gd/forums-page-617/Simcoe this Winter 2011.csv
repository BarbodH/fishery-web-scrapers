514632,Sharkbait22,2010-10-25 13:20:00,297,I’m hoping a couple people can help me out.  Walking out to whitefish grounds from the east side of the lake is a long hard walk   . I’m coming from the Kawarthas and looking for a few places I can access the lake with a sled.  I’ve fished Simcoe for several years by foot. This year I bought a fishing snowmobile. I’m hoping to find something around Holmes Point up to Beaverton.  Any pointers would be great. Also does Sibbald Point PP require a day use pass in winter?  Willow Beach and Franklin an out-of-town parking pass?  PM me if you wish. Thanks.
514939,keiths,2010-10-26 14:26:00,30,Not much use going out of Beaverton too early in the season for whitefish. The ice is usually iffy out to the North end of the island. We also travel from the Kawarthas and we go to Jackson's Point or Willow Beach. Parking is free as we park in the town lots or on the shore. Email me and I will give more specific info.
