Juli's shot is titled, Restoule Provincial Park...my favorite pic from our late August vacation.  Me standing waist deep in the water in the early morning mist. She'd appreciate any votes cast her way.  Have to get her to sign up on the board, one of these days.  Thanks!!   http://shareyourontario.com/index.php/photo-gallery?category=2"
