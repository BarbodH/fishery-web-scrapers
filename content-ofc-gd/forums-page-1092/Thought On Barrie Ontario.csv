154449,RyanJohnson,2008-01-27 02:53:00,11,"I moved to Barrie, to go to college and never left. I got a great Job close to home, to work in Barrie and make a City wage is a blessing. It has a small town mentality, but its a City. Its perfectly situated for myself being right on Simcoe though its close enough to the Muskoka's and a short trip up the 400 to the GTA. The last year I moved to Innisfil, where I have some land, and 2 mins to the Boat launch and 2 min to the Fish Hut. Its Perfect, who said anything about 9 lb lakers and 6 lb smallies, more like 25 lb lakers (ive caught one) and 7-9 lb smallies ( ive caught a 7.5, and a friend has a 9.5 mounted, .2 off the Canadian Recort) I will be here for a while!!"

154529,BillM,2008-01-27 16:03:00,17367,"I moved to Barrie 4 years ago to be closer to family.  I make the daily commute into Toronto 5 days a week.  About 200km's round trip per day.  I don't find the drive to bad at all, but it all depends on what time you need to be in TO for.  I work a 7-4 shift, so I usually miss most of the traffic.  Luckily for me I own a car that gets 50MPG   I would never do the commute if I was filling up the car with gas instead of diesel.  My average fuel costs per month are around $200-250 per month.   I love the fact that I can drive 30 mins and be on the Severn River for 2-3hrs of fishing with the oldman after work, you can't beat that.  There are a few tricks to miss the traffic, but thankfully I have an employer that understands my situation so I do have the option of working from home on those fridays in the summertime which clog up the 400 to no end.  If I have to be in the city, I'll rip up Weston to 9, then up a side road that intersects 27, up 27 for a bit until I get get on sideroad 5 then all the way in.  It's not to bad, and it beats sitting on the 400 doing 10km/h...  It's all personal preference though.. I would never live in the city, I absolutely hate it."
154298,Big Cliff,2008-01-26 10:24:00,6899,"If you are looking at Barrie and thinking of driving into TO everyday...... Summer time lots of traffic as you battel with all the cottagers heading up/down the 400. Winter time lake effect snow can make that highway a parking lot/scrap yard several times a winter. I've got nothing bad to say about Barrie but I wouldn't consider it if you intend to drive into TO everyday.  Lindsay to TO isn't too bad, the 407 is due to be extended over to the 115/35 in the not too distant future, Go trains are soon going to be coming into Pontypool (10 Minutes drive South of here) and in the short term you could just drive down to Oshawa (30 minutes) and take the GO train into TO.  Fishing..... Well you are 35 minutes away from Simco, 30 minutes or less to Scugog, you can fish right in town in the Scugog River and you have all of the Kawarthas right on your door step and you've got a seat in my boat or on my dock anytime you want to use it.  Housing prices: well a new upscale detached is in the $200,000.00 - $225,000.00 price range but there are lots of good deals on detached houses in the $150 - $200,000.00 range too and with the way this town is starting to grow any realestate in this area is going to be a good investment."
154304,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-26 12:26:00,2585,its way to busy for me.  downtown is closed every weekend it seems in the summer and between the 400 and that molson park exit its a nightmare.  although where on the outskirts of the big smoke isnt a travel terror?  cheers!
154307,tinbanger,2008-01-26 12:45:00,1028,"born in Barrie and moved back about 16 yrs ago. What I tell people if is you're moving here ( and working in TO) for the cheaper than TO houses only ...forget it . But if you also want the lifestyle (Simcoe ,ski hills etc ,the near north on your doorstep) then go fo it . I did the daily commute ( company car ) for about 12 years and survived! My job takes me all over southern ontario , so one day drive to the TO ,next day London ,next day Kingston etc Now I 'm awork from home 1-2 days a week ...not so bad.  As far as fishing goes , of course Simcoe , tons of creeks and streams around ,the Muskokas and Georgian Bay keep us pretty busy year round. We also fish the valley alot ( grew up north  of Kingston , have a hunt camp in the valley) and I miss all those small hidden lakes . but like I said we still get out there 5-6 times a year to fish  Overall Have never regretted the move the Barrie , planning to stay .

154331,Rob,2008-01-26 15:11:00,467,"I live in Oro Station. I grew up in the Barrie area (Innisfil) and lived in Barrie for a couple of years. It was nice being close the ammenities of Barrie, but still desired the country living. Been in Oro for 16 years now and love it. I am five minutes from the boat launch, 1/2 hour to muskoka area and 45 mins to work (Newmarket). I would like to work in Barrie-Orilia area but love the place I'm at. Oro is a great area to live as well as the Twshps of Springwater, Essa and Tiny. Barrie is like the others have said, very busy, but living here in Oro, I can go to Orillia as it has pretty much the same stores as Barrie without all the crazy congestion.  Rob C"
154397,misfish,2008-01-26 22:51:00,29133," Rob C has the best area of all. Nice little community, and like he said,minutes to a boat launch or two.  Hey Rob,how ya been bud?"
