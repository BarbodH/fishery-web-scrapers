154002,Ryan Landry,2008-01-25 01:34:00,128,"Hello everyone,  My name is Ryan Landry and I'm a fishaholic.  I have been meaning to do this intro for a while now but I have a very busy schedule and very little free time on my hands. I have been lurking around this site for a while and think it's awsome, it turly is a community!  For the past year my two business partners and I have been developing our own line of fishing lures. This started with a salt water line (mackerel jigs, squid jigs, cod jigs) then moved into freshwater lures (hard lures, spoons, spinners, swimbaits, ice fishing).  We have just recieved our first shipment and are working diligently to photograph everything to complete our website. Once this is complete and our site sponsorship is in order I will post the name of our product line.  Now on to the pictures. Instead of the usual pike, walleye and bass pics (which I can't compete with anyway) I thought I would post some different pictures.  These pics were taken In Cape Bretton Island summer 2006 and 07 all salt water species.  This is me holding a sculpin    flounder    Mackerel These fish feed in schools, thats why sabiki rigs are so effective.   My partner Gilles with 4 mackerel on a sabiki rig.  Caught one on my fly rod.   Rock cod (caught on a squid jig)    Perch   Herring   Lumpfish   Squid    My partner Devon with his jumbo squid!   The small one is the ""normal"" size we catch, around 7 or 8 inches   Cohogs (giant clams we catch while snorkeling)     My brother and I going for a swim, the water temp was about 65 (freeeeezing)     this is a WARNING to everyone, If you are hungry DO NOT look at these next pics!         fresh snow crab     Lobster   6 pounders (too big to eat)    Calamari    My grand father eating clams we dug, he's 82 and I have a hard time keeping up with him.   Hope you enjoyed my first post.  Thanks,  Ryan Landry"
