154229,Meely,2008-01-26 00:27:00,282,"Well, Its time to start planning my spring cottage project.  This year I plan on dressing up a boring wood-panel wall in my living room. I have decided to go with the ""stone"" look.  After researching products, I have come to learn that there are various sized panels, styles and patterns of faux stone that can be screwed into a wall as opposed to using mortar etc. My problem is, all the suppliers, I have found, are in the US and I really dont wanna pay all the shipping and customs fees.  Does any OFC'er have a lead/idea where I can find a local dealer of such products in the GTA ??  Any feed back on these products??  Thanks for any help,  Meely"
154233,irishfield,2008-01-26 00:49:00,26272,Timbr Mart and probably most other lumber yards have similar products Meely. It's also made by Steel Tile in Barrie..well their facility next door anyhow.  Here's one distributor in TO  http://www.advancedrock.net/region_canada.asp

154261,Gerritt,2008-01-26 02:24:00,6129,This is simple... I just finished ordering and having our guys install some of this stuff Works out to about 1.00 Per SQF... Less then ceramic tiles!  http://polyart.koredesign.com/   They are located in Oakville.  Enjoy the new look!  G.
154262,Gerritt,2008-01-26 02:26:00,6129,I should add... too simple to install... I should have hired a bunch of monkeys for the day...   again... wicked product!  G
154263,Rooky,2008-01-26 02:41:00,11,That looks like exactly what i  want.  thanks for the link.
154309,tinbanger,2008-01-26 12:58:00,1028,Meely Lots of fake stone product on the market now . Easy to install to .we did a wall in our old house of fake(concrete) brick.Can NOT tell its fake Plywood backer ( want a solid wall) and installed the brick with wall tile adhesive .Then grout . TB
154325,motv8tr,2008-01-26 14:48:00,2587,"Too bad none of them have the price made available   I would like to get rid of the siding on my house and these products look like they would do what I want.  I think the one Wayne posted gave a price per sheet, but I only took a quick look.  I need to figure out how much square footage the outside of my house is first  I guess, then maybe call them....  Maureen"
154336,Gerritt,2008-01-26 15:30:00,6129,"Moe, like I said I just purchased some and had it installed.. it worked out to be about 1.03 per SQF.  G."
154371,Gerritt,2008-01-26 18:38:00,6129,"Meely, I should add... ask for a discount!..  I did and they obliged! it was 13% or something... basically took care of the taxes  G"
154372,pigeonfisher,2008-01-26 18:42:00,696,1.03 installed?  That would make a pretty cool backsplash for a kitchen.  Would also look nice in a bathroom around a jaccuzzi tub.
154374,Gerritt,2008-01-26 18:52:00,6129,for the material Steve.. all you use is drywall screws and some PL.... Simple as pie.  You have an A B C D panel... it is idiot proof.  G
154407,Meely,2008-01-27 00:08:00,282,Thanx Gang. This is EXACTLY the stuff I'm looking for. I'll check out these links.  Meely
