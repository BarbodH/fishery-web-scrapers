We had a great time!  The ""jumbos"" were few and far between, but the experience was well worth it.  Special thanks to Keith at Innisfil Bait and tackle for taking the time to answer all of my questions.  Callander Bay is on the schedule for next weekend!  Looking to get the family on to some bigger fish! "

I did get to try out my FISHTV underwater camera.  It more than made up for my poor showing.  It's amazing how many pickups you miss without it.  Fish would suck it in and spit it out before you know it, grab the minnow by the tail when you hook it by the head or back.  Most times you don't even see the rod tip move.  jjcanoe"
