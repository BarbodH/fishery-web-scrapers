154505,Roy,2008-01-27 13:31:00,13728,"Thanks for the link, Marc. Some of the internet arguments seem so petty when you read things like this. Good on Lawrence Euteneier."
154613,camillj,2008-01-27 21:16:00,1988,"Yes, thanks Mark ... it really helps to stop and think once in a while ... to appreciate what we have !   And to remember that we have so much we can offer to others ... even if it is just a little bit of our time !"
154624,JustinHoffman,2008-01-27 21:45:00,482,"Hello All,  I had the honour of having Lawrence around to my apartment the other week. It was my first time meeting him in person, and his seeing-eye dog, and I must say, this man is an inspiration. The knowledge, articulation and genuine caring nature that Lawrence holds is something few of us will ever attain. I have an invite to join him out in the boat this season, and am hoping to do a feature piece on him for one of the magazines...his story is one worth telling.  Good Fishing,  Justin"
