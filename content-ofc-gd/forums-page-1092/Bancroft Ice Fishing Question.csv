154556,Ramble,2008-01-27 17:29:00,713,"I'm planning on heading up to the Bancroft area this upcoming weekend...we havn't decided on a lake yet. I'm wonder what the ice conditions are like up that way?  I'm presuming they are in decent shape. We wont be on any big water, but i'd still like to have an idea.  I'm also looking for any tips or suggestions for catching brook trout up that way. Water depth we should be targeting, and the kind of under water structure we should be focusing on. It will be the 1st time dad and I are are going to be out on the ice targeting brookies. From what i understand we should be looking for 10-20 feet of water near a  point or some other location like that. That said I like to hear what works well for other people.  Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks. -Ramble"
