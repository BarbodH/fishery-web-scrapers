Put her out Today where I was expecting to find 6 in of ice to find 4 in. Was a little concerned, due to the 8"" of blocks we had to put under her to stop it from sinking. But if she gets cold tonight, all that water should freez and were looking at least 10 inches. It was a slow morning but got red hot mid afternoon with 2 nice Lakers and 1 lost fish, probably a whitie. Heading out first thing tomorrow, good luck to all heading out."
