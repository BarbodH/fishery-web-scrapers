154444,Fishmaster,2008-01-27 02:32:00,920,What a start to hard water  fishing ! Lots of walleye caught today of all sizes with some big girls released . Seemed everyone was having good luck today and what a beautiful day for fishing !I even skipped out front  for a hour before dark ...and as soon as I dropped the vex in 13 fow  spotted fish .it  wasn’t long before  I had 3 on the ice with the guy beside me leaving  before dark with his limit in 30 min . Buck Shots and Rapala  Jigs tipped with shinners  were the ticket…
