A topic, that whether we like it or not affects us all. I don`t know when it will be on again.  Fact, LOL Mine, the price of oil has gone up to ten times the cost in my driving history, roughly 40 years. 30 cents a gallon to 3 bucks a gallon, picture the next 40 years, increased demand, increasing population, diminishing reserves.  The program covers a lot of ground."
