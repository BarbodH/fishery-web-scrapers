We got out, got set up around the outside of a big pack in anywhere from 6-12 ft of water, and within the first hour we get the biggest perch I've ever seen up close.  It was about 1 1/8 pound (I've never done much jumbo fishing).  Then, about 15 minutes later I hook into a good size fish that's taking lots of line.  I figure it MUST be a good size eye.  I finally get a glimpse at it, and I realize I have a muskie on.  We somehow managed to get it through the 6 inch hole in the ice and it probably weighed about 10 pounds! Other than that nothing, and the bite looked to be really slow for everyone, but the muskie made it more than worth it for me!"
154475,crappieperchhunter,2008-01-27 04:40:00,2582,I was out Friday night and had a Muskie on myself. No way it was coming up my 5 inch auger hole. After the 3rd time I had it up to the hole it spit the hook...thankfully...so I never lost my lure. I usually manage a muskie or two every winter on Scugog. I am not a muskie fisherman and I have only ever got them by accident through the ice on Scugog. Sure is entertaining with 4LB line and a 5 inch auger hole.
