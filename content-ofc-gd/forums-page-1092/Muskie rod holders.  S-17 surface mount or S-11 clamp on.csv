154230,glen,2008-01-26 00:29:00,2641,Are the S-17 and the S-11 salty's the same other than the clamping or bolting on part???    They look like they will hold the rod the same.  I am thinking of getting the bolting on ones.  Thanks for any help.
154231,irishfield,2008-01-26 00:42:00,26272,One just looks to have a lower bracket for bolting on Glen. Here's their website. It's the S-10 that is a double clamp on.  http://www.down-east.com/clamp-on.htm  You can also see why they are a deal in BPS for $22.95/23.95 cdn in Vaughn.. retail list is $38US for the S-10
154232,glen,2008-01-26 00:49:00,2641,BPS is a good deal.  I guess i will call to see if they have the bolt on ones.  Thanks Wayne.
154234,Smokey,2008-01-26 00:54:00,1278,BPS wasn't carrying them in the spring when I needed a few. I bought mine at JB's and the prices where just as good. JB's is one of the few places in the Toronto area that keeps stock on hand in most models.
154236,glen,2008-01-26 01:00:00,2641,I called Lebarons last week and they are not selling downeast rod holders this year.  They had them last year.  Its seems hard to get the bolt on ones.  Thanks Smokey i will try there if not BPS.
154237,irishfield,2008-01-26 01:02:00,26272, I've never noticed the bolt on S-17's in there Glen... may have been there..just wasn't what I was after. The clamp on S-10's are generally hanging on the end of a shelving unit..an end facing the reel counter.  And Mike's got a point...go spend the money at JB's if they have it... and Browse muskie row while you're in there.  JB's # 1-416-614-7222
154240,SlowPoke,2008-01-26 01:09:00,2984,I prefer the S17's myself but they are hard to find... especially in black powdercoat - almost extinct 'round these here parts! I settled for the 'classic' look. The S10 and S17 use the same bucket/holder jst the mount is different. The D series is smaller for single clamps and rail mounts. -Brian
154244,glen,2008-01-26 01:15:00,2641,I have some time before opener so i will track down the S-17. You guys are a great help.  Thanks.
154247,irishfield,2008-01-26 01:18:00,26272, Only 139 days Glen!!
154249,SlowPoke,2008-01-26 01:21:00,2984,"Crap, that's only 20 paycheques away!"
154250,ccmtcanada,2008-01-26 01:24:00,7971,I picked up two of the S-10's at BPS in Vaughn about 3 weeks ago....great price at around $24 bucks each too.
154253,irishfield,2008-01-26 01:32:00,26272,Glen... if you can't find locally. Here's a dealer in MN that's at least cheaper than Down-east directly  http://www.thornebros.com/muskie/trolling_...g_downeast.html  Dang... I shouldn't have gone there.. they have muskie baits as well at fair prices.  Here's a place that has the -11 and the -16 kit to make it a -17 at good prices.  http://www.stripertackle.net/proddetail.as....asp?prod=DES11  found the -17 from them for only $23.95 !!  http://www.stripertackle.net/proddetail.as....asp?prod=DES17  all the holders they carry  http://www.stripertackle.net/products.asp?cat=45
