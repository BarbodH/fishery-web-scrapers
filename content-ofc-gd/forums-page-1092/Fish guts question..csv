152421,liquidsniper,2008-01-20 17:12:00,11," MNR Clear?!?!?!?!?!  Come on now.  One reply saying it's alright doesn't make it right.  I've seen alot of replies from The Great MNR regarding the licencing of portable ice huts, alot of which say you have to, some which say you don;t, and even some tht say they'll get back to you when they find out.  So as for the MNR response being clear, clear as mud."
152730,jedimaster,2008-01-21 15:55:00,3472,The MnR is never clear on anything. You will have to call at least 3 different offices at 3 different times on 3 different days and record each phone call and cross reference the answers before its a clear answer.

154238,Pinch,2008-01-26 01:04:00,231," I disagree, the only reply that we have from the MNR states that in the hole it goes.  The rest of the responses are second hand information.  Until we hear anything to the contrary from the MNR then the first and only response from them is right and crystal clear.  As for the portable ice hut licensing, yes that is a complete mess with contradictory information, however, thats not the case with the guts issue, so its irrelevant.  IMHO"

As plants are consumed by some critters and those critters by other critters, the energy passes up the chain. Naturally all the critters die and sink or float along redistributing that energy back into the lake from whence it came. Think of it as a farmers field...you can only pull nutrients out of the soil and not return them so many times. The law does not permit the introduction of deleterious components to the water. Considering the natural cycle of life, fish guts cannot be considered deleterious. The guts will be eaten by minnows and crayfish and those in turn by larger predators. I believe i read somewhere the ideal depth for dumping of guts was 14 ft (maximum oxygen concentration). Some consider it unsightly, so it is best done away from docks and beaches if possible."

152274,Pinch,2008-01-20 00:32:00,231, I thought that the MNR reply was pretty clear.  Back down the hole it is!
152318,skeeter,2008-01-20 05:04:00,1907,so then we should gut the fish and leave it behind then? sounds good to me then i wont have to do it when i get home. less garbage to carry out.   Dann
