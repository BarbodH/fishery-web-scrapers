154220,Gerritt,2008-01-25 23:26:00,6129,"Press Release BRP ROLLS OUT EVINRUDE E-TEC 300 HP OUTBOARD ENGINE Worldwide expansion of successful Evinrude E-TEC outboards continues into higher horsepower Sturtevant, WI, January 24, 2008 – BRP's newest addition to the 2008 Evinrude® E-TEC® outboard engine line is now available at Evinrude dealerships worldwide. The 300-hp models, with new SLE Magnum gearcase, offer the unique combination of industry-leading innovation, performance, and ease-of-use that all Evinrude E-TEC engines provide for boaters who seek a premium power of choice. “The 300-hp Evinrude E-TEC engine gives off-shore anglers and high performance boating enthusiasts a new choice in low maintenance, low emission outboard power,” says Roch Lambert, vice president and general manager, Outboard Marine Engines, BRP. “The 300-hp carries the same 3-year / 300-hour benefit of no dealer scheduled maintenance, consistent with all Evinrude E-TEC engines. No other brand of outboard engine allows consumers to spend more time on the water,"" he continues. ""We're confident that this unique benefit now delivered in the 300-hp engine will enable the Evinrude brand to continue its strong growth in the market."" Consumers will be able to experience the new 300-hp Evinrude E-TEC engine when it debuts at the upcoming Miami International Boat Show this February. ""The international success of Evinrude E-TEC engines is incredible and it continues to change the industry,"" noted Michel Hade, vice president and general manager, BRP International Division. ""The Evinrude brand has been a key driver of growth, resulting in increased profitability for our dealers, distributors and BRP, and aiding in the transition to cleaner emission products in many markets. As we continue to expand our state-of-the-art Evinrude line-up, we further define, through the E-TEC technology, world leading products that deliver the best recreational experience available,"" he concluded. With 3.4 liters of displacement, the engine offers more torque, low-end power and top speed than similar competitive two and four stroke outboard engines. This additional power allows boaters to plane heavy loads, pull skiers, wake boarders or tubers better than ever before. Additional torque is particularly beneficial for boating in high altitude areas and in hot climates. The Evinrude E-TEC 300-hp wraps a big block two-stroke direct injection power plant in a compact, lightweight design that provides more performance than competitive engines at the Page 2 same horsepower. An amazing high power to low weight ratio provides a host of advantages including greater fuel efficiency, less draft for improved boat handling, faster boat planing, and less stress on the structural integrity of the boat transom. One of the biggest benefits of the unique Evinrude E-TEC technology is increased fuel economy and extended boating range. Performance testing has shown that the new 300-hp engine can deliver as much as 35-40-percent improvement in fuel economy and 50-percent improvement in oil consumption when compared to traditional electronic fuel injection (EFI) models. The 300-hp Evinrude E-TEC includes an all-new SLE Magnum high performance gearcase - the most durable V-6 gearcase BRP has ever made. Its hydrodynamic design increases speed and engine efficiency while providing superior control. A computer designed leading edge reduces the chance of weeds wrapping around the housing that could compromise cooling and performance. Secondary water inlets, located at the nose of the gearcase housing, provide improved cooling over a wider range of conditions. An innovative forward gear and bearing design increases strength and durability while movement and wear are greatly reduced with a new propshaft bearing carrier. The new Evinrude E-TEC 300-hp engine is available in white 25- and 30-inch shaft models as well as counter-rotating models and carries BRP's unbeatable factory-backed three year nondeclining warranty. Bombardier Recreational Products (BRP), a privately-held company, is a world leader in the design, development, manufacturing, distribution and marketing of motorized recreational vehicles.
