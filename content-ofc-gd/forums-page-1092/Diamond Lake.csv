Thanks!"
154506,Smokey,2008-01-27 13:39:00,1278,Lake trout and bass are the only fish found in the lake. I used to fish between the 20 and 40 ft mark and catch them there. It's not really a deep lake and minnows worked best for me.  Good Luck

If you dont have much luck on dimond take a 5 min drive to Baptiste Lake where you will find a good mix of spices."
