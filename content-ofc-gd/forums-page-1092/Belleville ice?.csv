154460,duber,2008-01-27 03:23:00,220,Depends on were you fish . I was on 3-12 inches today.Your best bet for safe ice is off the Herkimer street ramp.Saw some guys out off of point anne but I don't know what the ice is like.Sam at Carra Outdoors has a report page on his website or you could call him or Ron at Skevy's in the morning or stop in and buy some minnows from either and get the low down on were to go.  Good luck and play safe
