Which species i can use as dead bait? New regulations lists live bait species on page 10. Nothing said about dead ones. Can i use smelts and sardines from grocery stores? Or it's illegal? I called ministry today and operator (lady) said that i can use only listed species, live or dead, doesn't matter... Sounds stupid to me. How I can find out the real answer? Thank you! Max"

154019,waterwolf,2008-01-25 02:13:00,556,pretty sureb it's a dead issue but i'll see what i can find out .

154258,waterwolf,2008-01-26 02:19:00,556,sorry for the delay i didn't get that response i was hoping for . i'm heading out tomorrow for pike and will definitely being using my go-to bait sardines. they really attract well and the imbedded hooks pull through easily for a quick and solid hook-set. i've been using them for years with no problem.  although there are restrictions on smelt and herring there is nothing mentioned on the salt -water sardine in the reg.'s  book. for me dead-sticking is #1 for finicky pike.
