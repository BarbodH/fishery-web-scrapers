So, I bought this game last week from EB games for $54.99+tax and none of us here really like it... our friends told us how fun and cool it was so i bought it... silly me, I should have tried it first cuz EB wont let me return an opened game... so this has been played 2 times only so it is in MINT brand new condition with box, and it comes with a cool fishing rod that you put the Wii control and nunchuk in so its like you are actually fishing... any fishers out there.. lol hope someone wants it cuz it was alot of money and would probably be fun and cool for someone... Paid I think $62.00 with the tax... looking for at least $45 as it is brand new. thanks  south end barrie.  [emailÂ protected]  Maureen"
154347,bassmaster4,2008-01-26 16:19:00,801,maybe EB games will buy it back from you but they tend to rip people off a lot so i can see why you want to sell it
154503,fish_finder,2008-01-27 13:28:00,370,You could also just hang on to it as one of those useless fishing things you bought but never use.....its all about the addiction!!  I swear every room in my house has something fishing related in it....but the only stuff  I use is in my vest and tackle boxes!!  D.
