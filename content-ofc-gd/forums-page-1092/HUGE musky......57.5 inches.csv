154638,trapshooter,2008-01-27 22:42:00,1234,Lac Seul!!  Yeah!
154653,Greencoachdog,2008-01-27 23:11:00,8163,"You catch'em like that all the time, don'tcha Lew?  I've got to admit, that fish didn't look to sporty on the release. No telling how long it took to get the hooks out... I hope he stayed in the area for a while to make sure she was ok.  That thing would make one heckuva fish fry!"
154742,ilario11,2008-01-28 04:43:00,41,Beauty fish... great vid considering the guy was alone..  I wonder how many d not survive after a long fight and being out of the water and handled... anyone know what the survival rates are? I'm sure the odd one does die   thanks for the link
154751,Ramble,2008-01-28 05:33:00,713,I found an article on it. Ill post it as its own thread so everyone can see it. It's a VERY interesting read.
154794,mistyriver1,2008-01-28 13:51:00,600,What a beauty.  Thanks Lew.
154806,John,2008-01-28 15:12:00,2956,"Thanks for posting Lew, beauty indeed."
154559,lew,2008-01-27 17:37:00,12767,And it lived to fight another day too  http://muskie.outdoorsfirst.com/board/foru...=48&start=1
154562,glen,2008-01-27 17:44:00,2641,Ok i am ready to go fishing now.
154563,Guest skeeter99,2008-01-27 17:44:00,0,looks like from the video it is gonna be a dead 57.5 incher   she was not in a big hurry to go anywhere was she!!!
154564,mistaredone,2008-01-27 17:44:00,913,
154566,Roy,2008-01-27 17:45:00,13728,An absolutely beautiful fish for sure. I understand when he says about being alone in the boat. Those are the kinds of moments best shared. Glad he had a digicam with him though! BEAUTY! Thanks for posting Lew.
154567,Ryan Landry,2008-01-27 17:49:00,128,"I think he did pretty good, considering he was on his own.  NICE FISH!  p.s. I'm also ready to go fishing now."
154568,Roy,2008-01-27 17:57:00,13728,"You're right, Ryan. Cut the guy some slack guys. He was alone in the boat and I don't know how many of you folks have seen the difference in releasing a 57"" as opposed to a 37 incher."
154570,musky_man,2008-01-27 17:59:00,159,"That was a beaut -- thanks, Lew.  Mark"
154572,irishfield,2008-01-27 18:05:00,26272,"None of the big ones we caught this fall, with Thorpe, seemed to be in any hurry to swim away. They don't even thrash/roll in the net like the smaller ones Lew and I caught on the BOG this fall did. It's like...""I've been here before..get them hooks out of my face and let me go about my business"". Then they take their time at the side of the boat and slowly swim away.  Great find Lew !"
154573,silveradosheriff,2008-01-27 18:07:00,1025,Yikes - what a beast! Gotta go sharpen some hooks....
154577,tdotfisherman,2008-01-27 18:18:00,317,Wow.. If I caught a muskie HALF that size I would be extatic... that was just unreal..
154580,lunkerbasshunter,2008-01-27 18:26:00,2585,big fish for sure!!  must have be a challenge getting that thing boated by yourself  cheers!
154585,Guest skeeter99,2008-01-27 18:36:00,0,sorry just a observation!!!!  I did not say he did not do a good job!!!  she just looked like she was done from the video rolling up on her side. the stress on the fish of her size is huge and does kill some of them a few hours later. but a beast to say the least
154589,Handlebarz,2008-01-27 19:01:00,3790,Dang that was a beast. Yep them big girls like to take there time and just take a slow leave from the boat it is nice sight to watch.
154591,Squid,2008-01-27 19:20:00,1656,Thanks for the link Lew. That was a really nice fish.
154593,2 tone z71,2008-01-27 19:46:00,1311,"ahh man that was awesome thanks for sharing I watched it a few times,come on spring"
154594,camillj,2008-01-27 19:46:00,1988,Wow .... I mean .... WOW !  The guy said he saw her again a week or so later ... so there is a happy ending  Thanks Lew .. Now I cant wait till the ice melts and I havent even been out yet
154602,GbayGiant,2008-01-27 20:38:00,1780,"That's  a monster, good stuff. She made it, takes a while. This is the stuff that makes me daydream all winter, can't wait till opener."
154607,fishindevil,2008-01-27 20:56:00,6254,Well it sure is...A TROPHY OF A LIFETIME.. !!!!!!...    a huge muskie
154608,mattyk,2008-01-27 20:58:00,2110,"that was a beast, thanks for the posting the link lew."
154610,Rich Clemens,2008-01-27 21:03:00,3131,It's one thing to see pics of such monsters ... but a video !     Thanks Lew.  How many days until the opener ?
154611,irishfield,2008-01-27 21:11:00,26272,138 Rich... 138 !
154612,Jeff R,2008-01-27 21:11:00,94,"Great link for sure lew...The fact that he was able to do all that by himself and it survived, is as impressive as the fish....don't think I could have done it.......How do you top that tho'?"
154636,addict,2008-01-27 22:40:00,475,what a pig plus the backround tunes were rockin.she probally swam away those biguns usually dont speed off just swim slowly back to the depths.
154637,PAZE,2008-01-27 22:41:00,132, Catch a bigger one.
