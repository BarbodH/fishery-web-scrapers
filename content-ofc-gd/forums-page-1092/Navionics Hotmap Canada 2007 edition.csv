154120,doubleheader,2008-01-25 14:47:00,497,"Good morning everyone. Can anyone comment relative to the accuracy and detail of this chip on the west arm of Nipissing?  Are all the reefs accurately marked and located?  I've been toying with adding a kicker motor but wonder if this chip wouldn't be an effective and inexpensive solution. Appreciate your feedback and have a great day.  BTW, Cabelas has this chip ofr sale @ $99.  Maybe cheaper elsewhere but just thought I'd add that to all interested."
154125,lew,2008-01-25 15:10:00,12767,"I picked up the Hotmap Premiun 07 last year for the West Arm and was very impressed with it. I purposely came in close to alot of the structure to check the accuracy of the map and for the most part it was right on, but that's no guarantee that everything is marked 100%.  I spent 5 days cruising the Arm last August and had no problems at all.  Just be aware though, that NOTHING on the West Arm west of Hwy 64 is marked, it only shows the area to the east.  $99 for that chart is an incredible price, I think I payed $175 at West Marine in Toronto."
154129,Garyv,2008-01-25 15:15:00,547,Before I purchased one I asked lew about his.  He told me the chip does not cover west of highway 64 but he was satisfied with the detail east.  Perhaps you should PM him about it. Also make sure the $99 is not the 2006 chip as there are far less lakes on it.  Oops guess Lew beat me
154144,irishfield,2008-01-25 16:14:00,26272,"It sure takes the jitters out of ""playing"" in Muskrat bay for sure !  Only shoaled the boat once (getting tooooo daring)...vs who knows how many times it would have happened trying to remember where we were on the paper map.  It's very accurate...so accurate that a day out with me changed Lew's train of thought and he bought his chip. And like Lew states... it shows NOTHING West of #64"
154146,JorgeCarlos,2008-01-25 16:23:00,109,Do you know wich  Navionic card will show lake Simcoe?? thanks guys
154147,Guest skeeter99,2008-01-25 16:24:00,0,"hold off if you are buying one right now ie. 2006 or 2007  the new one for 2008 should be out in stores by febraury and they have added 33 lakes and alot of high definition maps of lakes already previously there  here are the links  http://www.navionics.com/HMPremium08Catalog.asp  http://www.navionics.com/Premium08LakeList.asp?RegionID=5  that is why the 2006 and 2007 chips are $99, still a great deal with lots of lakes   it shows everything in lake simcoe, very detailed"
154149,Guest skeeter99,2008-01-25 16:33:00,0,"well thanks guys for reminding me about this, they finally got the new one in stock for canada  i just ordered mine from bass pro  $149  for a total of $169.95 shipped to my door  I wanted to upgrade my gold card anyway   now does anyone want to buy a navionics gold card for east great lakes and includes the kawarthas for $50"
154152,doubleheader,2008-01-25 16:41:00,497,"It sounds like the 07 chip is a worthwhile investment.  For my purpose I'll be using the chip for the west arm exclusively and don't care too much about west of the Rt 64 bridge.  Will the 08 chip be better than the 07 for areas east of the bridge?  I'm waiting for an answer from Navionics, but in the meantime I snatched up one of the 07 chips from Cabelas thinking I could return it unopened in the unlikley chance Nipissing was substantially improved for 08. All I really care about is from Rt 64 east to the main lake; I've never even been further east than that.  Hope it helps me stay off the reefs. They seem to attarct me like magnets.  Thanks for the feedback everyone, it is very much appreciated."

154205,Rich Clemens,2008-01-25 22:39:00,3131,I think I paid about 149.00 US from GPS City last year and also received a $50.00 rebate coupon.  Total cost to me $99.00 US plus S/H.      Kinda neat to go west of 64 and see yourself motoring along on dry ground.  Maybe someday it will be updated.
154207,irishfield,2008-01-25 22:44:00,26272, Was kinda funny looking on the screen for sure..line on a blank background...... but you can still mark your waypoints when you find fish. And follow your line in the dark without hitting the shoals.
154214,Guest skeeter99,2008-01-25 23:09:00,0,"that's right irish, if you make it there without crashing stick to that line like glue and you will be good, and for that matter save it as a trail so you will have it forever!!!   then of course offload all your wayppoints and trails onto your pc in case your gps goes south on you and you will have a backup file  happened to me once already gps died, lost a few newer points but nothing to hard that I could not find again and remark"
154217,irishfield,2008-01-25 23:19:00,26272,Just be sure that you are on FULL zoom when following your trail ! It gets expensive when you don't...as Bcanuck/Joe/Art and myself found out one evening on Nipissing in 2005.
154222,Roy,2008-01-25 23:36:00,13728,"Peter, the way I see it is this. Navionics is good stuff but it's basically offered in two main categories, marine charts and lake maps. At the begining there were just marine charts. At that time, not every Tom, Dick and Harry had a chartplotter. Consequently, they were offering the marine charts to people using ""navigable waters"" which for North America included the entire west coast (Pacific) and the entire East coast (Atlantic). This also included main inland waterways such as the St Lawrence to the Great Lakes. In our case, there were three usable chips for Ontario and Quebec. The 900, 901 and 902 chips which covered some of the great Lakes and the Larry all the way out to the Maritimes. The middle chip, the 901, has Lake Ontario the Rideau System (navigable) the Trent System (navigable) which includes the Kawarthas. Georgian Bay and Lake simcoe was/is on that one as well. Well, wouldn't you know it, the powers that be saw fit to remove the errors in satelite transmission making reception of more accurate location available to everyone. Plotters came down in price and we now had folks screaming to have their favorite lakes available....not an easy task. So, Navionics adds another series of maps to their lineup and call them lake maps. These are more or less an addendum chip to the marine charts because of customer demand. These lake chips were available for  5 or 6 sections of the States and one section for Canada. The Canadian lakes chip had (very approximate numbers) 40 lakes in BC, a few in Alberta, 4 in Saskatchewan, 80-90 in Ontario and about 120 in Quebec. The maps of the main navigable waterways (marine charts) were the same maps you were buying for $20 or so for a very small section from the Canadian government. Today, they are adding maps as demand warrants and as they are available to them from what I can see. So, today, if you buy a lakes map, there are chances that there won't be any waters that are contained in the marine charts.  That should be fairly clear......it's only 6:30PM :-)"
154254,BITEME,2008-01-26 01:41:00,1969,Thanks ROY your the Bestest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
154378,Aaron Shirley,2008-01-26 19:28:00,655,"I have both the Great Lakes charts and Hotmaps Premium Canada, and I love them both.  The Great Lakes charts are quite accurate.  The Hotmaps Premium Canada isn't all that accurate, but close.  I found that out quickly, narrowly missing a reef one day in the middle of a lake that wasn't on the Hotmaps Premium.  The Hotmaps Premium is a great starting point and it gives you most of the structure on the lakes, helping to narrow your search for potential fishing spots... I would say about 90 percent.  You do have to be careful navigating with Hotmaps though.  Lakes on the Great Lakes Charts that are also on the Hotmaps Premium Canada have more detail on the Great Lakes Charts - FYI.  I can't live without both Navionics SD cards.  What did we do before we had these?  Oh yeah, triagulate spots until you find your spot and mark a waypoint, haha.  Which I still have to do on lakes that aren't on the Navionics charts.  Aaron"
