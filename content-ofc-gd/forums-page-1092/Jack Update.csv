He is getting back to his old self...demanding belly rubs and wants to play fetch and stuff. We were at my vet yesterday for the first time since the surgery. He said he was amazed Jack was even walking considering the damage done to the knee. He reminded me it would be six months before he will be able to be free-running again. He still has quite a limp..some days more than others. But he is coming along nicely. I am very happy that I do not have to carry him outside anymore (but my back is much happier). He has surprised me by jumping up on the couch a few times so I have to keep a constant eye on him when  he is out of the crate. He occasionally yelps when he does somethig not-quite-right but remembering my knee surgery, I was the same for about 6 weeks. He is getting bored now and misses his rother, but I am waiting another 4 weeks before bringing home my other pup from my moms place. I want to be reasonably sure he is much better before I allow the two of them together. I'll post pics later if I get the chance."
154167,b2kptbo,2008-01-25 18:29:00,1505,Good to hear...
154172,mistyriver1,2008-01-25 18:39:00,600,I'll bet your other pup misses his buddy as well.  thanks for the update.
154180,Bly,2008-01-25 19:07:00,1556,Thank you for the update Rick...so happy to hear that Jack is progressing!!   Won't be long now for everyone to be healthy and happy and all together again!!
154188,Joey,2008-01-25 19:47:00,9122,Great news Rick.  I look forward to the pics.  Joey
154198,John,2008-01-25 20:59:00,2956,"Sounds like positive news Rick. With him feeling better, now is the most difficult time as far as the healing process as he will want to do everything he normally did. It will be a tough for another month or two. Having said that he is in great hands."
154204,Rich Clemens,2008-01-25 22:36:00,3131,"Sounds like a long haul Rick, but sure is good to hear that Jack is getting better and better each day.   Appreciate the update.  I was just thinking about Jack last night on the way home from our vet."
154206,DebS,2008-01-25 22:41:00,56,That's great news Rick! So glad to hear that Jack is making good progress. Thanks for keeping us posted - looking forward to some new pics! DebS
154242,shane,2008-01-26 01:14:00,652,"Glad to hear things are getting better.  Good call on keeping them separated for a while.  Dogs just don't understand ""take it easy"" when it comes to playtime."
154245,Nanook,2008-01-26 01:17:00,565,  Thats good news to hear Rick. Thanks for the update.
154260,motv8tr,2008-01-26 02:23:00,2587,"Good to hear Rick, I bet Jack's brother will be happy to get back home though  Maureen"
154344,Garyv,2008-01-26 16:07:00,547,Great to hear and it sure looks like he will be up to his old tricks very soon.  Dogs seem to have amazing recuperative powers after surgery.  When his buddy comes back he will be a very happy dog.
