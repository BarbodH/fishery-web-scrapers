154256,tonyb,2008-01-26 01:55:00,1637,Looks like Dodo's 'Hoo's and Cuda's as well as some of the billed variety are available...  Check out Punta Cana Deep Sea Fishing  I'm sure there are others as well including the local fisherman and their pangas that are cheap.  But the website I listed is one of the more reputable operators down there.  Tony
154316,silveradosheriff,2008-01-26 13:32:00,1025,Thanks Guys - I'll check out both options.  :-)

154337,iceguy,2008-01-26 15:31:00,341,Bring your lucky fishing buddy.
154343,Crazyhook,2008-01-26 16:05:00,1154,bring a rod for some DYI fishing!... you can catch snapper and cudas from shore
154403,silveradosheriff,2008-01-26 23:43:00,1025,"Hey Gerritt, that suitcase would be my golf carry-all.....and I can't go there without my sticks! Rob, I think I'll cut off some of that lucky hair of yours....now that's karma. As for shore fishing, when my feet are on solid ground - my hands will be occupied by golf clubs or drinks (or both)!  :-)"
154417,iceguy,2008-01-27 00:44:00,341,Better get some soon as it's falling out pretty quick. I'm pretty sure I'll be there tuesday.
