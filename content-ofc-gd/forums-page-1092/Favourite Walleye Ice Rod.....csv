154341,mcallister.grant,2008-01-26 15:45:00,327,I am just trying to get everyone's opinion on their go to walleye ice rod. I am an avid user of med/light action but I am interested in seeing what you all have to say.  Thanks  GM
154342,Guest gbfisher,2008-01-26 16:04:00,0,Nothing like a stick in shallow water. It all depends on the person and what you get used to. Some use light. Some use a stick. I've seen both work equally well.

154383,GbayGiant,2008-01-26 20:12:00,1780,"I use a medium st.croix 30"" for everything from lakers, pike, walleye and perch, love the thing, it's pulled in 20lbs pike no problem and sensitive enough for perch, perfect for walleye. I find ice rods vary a lot though, one medium is another brands heavy or light so it comes down to quality just like any other. I think the st croix I got is IM8 graphite just like a regular rod it's amazing how strong and sensitive they are for the size, so I say just spend a little more and get high quality, I think it cost around $35 each for them so it's still cheap for a top quality ice rod."
