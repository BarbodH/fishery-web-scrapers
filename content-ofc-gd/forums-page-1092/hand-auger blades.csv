154707,waterwolf,2008-01-28 02:09:00,556,should mention my back-up was a hand auger doin' tose extra holes.
154711,Sinker,2008-01-28 02:15:00,8692,"I just replace them each season. I'll use last season blades until the ice is a foot......then put on the new ones......makes all the difference!  They're not expensive, and its the most important tool to fish the ice!!  Sinker"
154717,Riparian,2008-01-28 02:40:00,269,"It is possible to sharpen them back to scary sharp with the correct tools. those ""toothed"" blades can be sharpened with rod style sharpeners, A spyderco sharpmaker works really well DMT sets and a range of sandpaper on a flat surface will work.  Then again its easier just to buy new ones, but i'll be sharpening mine."
154732,waterwolf,2008-01-28 03:53:00,556,"i've always just bought new ones but seems like a waste to toss 'em just because they're dull . but i don't have the tools or if i did ,the know-how .lol . screw with  that cutting angle and your buyin' new anyway, sharp or not. thought maybe someone might do that at an outdoors store or something related . i got a  $50 gift card at  can .tire so those blades just got real cheap.                         thanks for feed -back guys."
154764,Big Cliff,2008-01-28 12:02:00,6899,"I have tried to sharpen them a few times but without much success then someone told me they are hollow ground (whatever that means) and unless you have special equipment you can never get them as good as if they are new. If my auger does start to get dull, I just buy new blades."
