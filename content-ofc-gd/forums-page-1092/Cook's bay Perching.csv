I too was fortunate enough to make it out onto cooks Saturday and had a great time. 60+ perch keeping 35 for a big 'ol fish fry with my buddy. Although we did fairly well took a fair amount of moving to get on the fish. Probably moved 8 times min.. and went a minimum of 100 yards or more in any direction each time whether following weeds or going deeper. One bit of advice I would have to say is give your spot a chance but don't spend too much time there. I have returned to previously productive spots and gotten nothing (although sometimes I do very well returning) and then move on. we spent approx 1/2 - 1 hr fishing a spot unless we got a bite or a fish. after that we would move... we found several productive spots and would fish them untlil the school moved. then give it 1/2-1 hr to see if they will return, if not we move. eventually we got to our final spot (not that we knew this of course) and had steady action for the rest of the day (3 or so hours) until we left at approx 430. Hopefully ya all have a chance to get out and do some fishing soon and I hope to read more and more of these successful reports. Ohh and I had a member recognize my hut this time out too... Bitsmith2k... Nice seeing ya out there, hope ya made out well! There were CO's out there on their sleds today checking for registration numbers and I have yet to register mine because I was unsure and still awaiting a response from the offices, so had a quick drop by where he checked our licenses and told us that because its pushing the size limit to get the Reg. #'s for it. (mine is a small collapsible hut) So looks like its time to register for those of you who are unsure... the CO's are saying we need to do so... I respect them and believe that this is obviously what we need to do to make their jobs easier. So unless something changes I will be registering my hut or not fishing out in it anytime soon... Have a good one all and play it safe  Bill"

154791,Bitsmith2k,2008-01-28 13:23:00,396,"hey bill.. glad to hear ya made out good.. good to see ya again.. we fished around the green huts into the afternoon and only got one fish to show for it... at least my buddy, who'd never been ice fishing before, got it..  he picked out out final spot of the day, completely randomly, and we got into them pretty good for an hour or so.. two of us caught about 100, kept 30 or so, of the bigger ones for the pan..i got one real nice jumbo as well..  got back out sunday again and our first set of holes was non stop for most of the day.. again lots of dinks, kept about 20 in the 9-10"" range..  the one thing i noticed, is that drop shotting white micro tubes was getting me a high percentage of keepers.."
154805,huntervasili,2008-01-28 15:04:00,1604,"Glad to hear you made out good too... I was trying tubes a little but didn't give much of a chance, considering what I was using was doing just great. Guess I will be trying that next time, Thanks"
