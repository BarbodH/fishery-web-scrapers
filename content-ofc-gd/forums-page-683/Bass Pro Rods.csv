I only had it a short while and would like to return it for another but of course I can't find the receipt. How have you found their customer service for this type of situation. I realize they don't have to honour the warranty without the receipt and it's my own fault for loosing it but some places are a little forgiving sometimes."

Call before you go, ask who the M.O.D. is on the date and time you plan to go there so you can ask for them right when you get there."
