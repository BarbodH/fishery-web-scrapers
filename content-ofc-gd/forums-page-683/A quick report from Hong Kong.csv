467707,Marko,2010-05-19 02:57:00,854,"What can i say Victor, wherever you go you catch small fish ahahahh! Nice report man, interesting looking fish."
467732,Afraz,2010-05-19 07:41:00,250,"I heard about the venom in the spines got pricked myself but don't recall getting any excessive pain, and yeah when i said herbivores i meant they eat crap growing on rocks they are like carp of the sea. And alot of folks snag em on the red sea too, when you gut em their insides smell horrible. I was told they were fantastic eating, since they didn't have any scales on them and were easy to find and catch.  Rabbit fish + snappers = Lower class sea food Grouper and Parrotfish = Middle class sea food Coral grouper Aka Najil = Upper class sea food  Lol this is how one of my arab buddies groups the rabbit fish, lol they are in the same boat as snappers so they can't be that bad."
467220,Victor,2010-05-17 16:09:00,1609,"Hey all,  I'm currently on my grad trip in Hong Kong. I have been here since Apr 21 and will be staying till beginning of June. However, even though I'm on the other side of the globe I still come on every so often and I still think fishing everyday . Did a side trip to Taiwan for 10 days and I dropped lots of $$ at the tackle shops there already. Most fishing in Taiwan and Hong Kong is saltwater and their tackle/technique is very different.  Yesterday I visited the public pier at Saigon, Hong Kong.   Along the pier all these fishermen display/sell their catch to the pedestrians on the pier, once the buyer pick out what he wants, the fisherman would use a long net to deliver the items.   Creatures in saltwater are just so colorful and pretty.   Of course I did a little bit of fishing and tried out the new whip that I bought in Taiwan.   That was the only fish that I caught but I'm happy to catch anything. I did raise a decent sized crab at one point but it let go of the bait when I tried to lift it out of the water. O well. I have made plans to fish for squid later in the week.  I hope everyone is doing great back home and I will post again on my squid trip if I'm successful  Victor"

467228,MJL,2010-05-17 16:29:00,2427,Hey Vic  Good to see you’re enjoying your trip…Very eager to hear about your squid fishing adventures...I'm actually tempted to run out and get some calamari myself.LOL  Do you know what that species of fish is you caught?

467270,Terry,2010-05-17 19:27:00,14456,cool stuff there
467274,fish-miester,2010-05-17 19:36:00,864,thats awesome ! im interested in seeing the lures myself..
467289,Gerritt,2010-05-17 20:26:00,6129,awesome! wonderful pictures I would love to see more! please keep us up to date on you're adventure
467298,Afraz,2010-05-17 20:48:00,250,"  I think that fish is a rabbit fish, we get em in the red sea and the locals call them SIJAAN. Apparently they are great eating and herbivores fish. Most of the guys i see fishing for them use green algae growing n rocks tied to 3 - 4 tiny treble hooks under a calcuta pole using a large fixed float.  I just caught one of these fish my entire life (incidental catch) it inhaled a peice of squid i was using to catch snapper."
467305,[email protected],2010-05-17 21:06:00,97,"  Yeah that is definitely a rabbit fish...amazing fight on light line...We used to catch tons of them on dough balls when growing up in Abu Dhabi..The locals used to call them ""Safi"" over there...Hope you din't get pricked by the fins as they have a mild venom at the tips which causes a severe stinging sensation....  Greats pics dude!  Tight lines squid fishin! F"
467312,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-17 21:29:00,0,Very nice! Talk about fresh! I guess its cheaper to buy from the locals then the commercial fisheries? Or is that their commercial fishery?  They probably don't need a commercial license either!  One question. Where are their rods?lol
467324,Joey,2010-05-17 22:02:00,9122,"What a cool report Victor, thanks for sharing that.  Joey"
467336,vinnimon,2010-05-17 22:19:00,2593,Thats awesome man!I hope you catch a lunker on your travels.Thanks for sharing
467435,Rattletrap2,2010-05-18 02:23:00,1652,Very interesting Victor! Thanks for sharing & safe travels!
467441,Victor,2010-05-18 02:33:00,1609," I have no idea what it's called in English, but I know its chinese name. I guess ""rabbit fish"" it is. However I don't think they are herbivores. These fish like to eat crap (literally crap), you find them around the dirtier water and they have tiny mouths. Here in HK people usually use an octopus hook (basically like 8 hooks all on one shank), put some dough above the hooks and snag them.  these would be considered local fisheries and they should be cheaper/fresher. The fish are probably caught by netting and the crabs/shrimp by submerging cages. As for the clams and other hardshelled seafood I have no idea :S"
467446,MJL,2010-05-18 02:40:00,2427, You should try them next time...Afraz and Fishingitis say they're tasty...Maybe they're like tilapia where their diet of excrement makes them so tender and juicy
467447,corvette1,2010-05-18 02:43:00,1765,awesome trip cool pictures
467450,Victor,2010-05-18 02:53:00,1609," Actually I did try eating them already at a restaurant, deep fried. It was quite good but then alot of fish taste similar when deep fried.  I wouldn't eat anything from where I was fishing, lots of sewage outlet mixed in with gasoline :S."
467454,splashhopper,2010-05-18 02:58:00,2931,great report Victor.... no carp yet? ..lol
467471,tb4me,2010-05-18 04:06:00,3295,awesome! Thanks for that..Id love to read up on the squid fishng!
