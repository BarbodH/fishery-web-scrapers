Saturday was pike opener in one of my favourite areas, I havent missed it in quite a few years and didnt plan on it this year.  So when I got the invitation to a good friend's wedding, I had a dilema. I'll make it work.  Saturday morning, Up super early and off we go.  On the water by 6:30 and first fish in the net before 7am.  Landed a bunch of smaller 2-4 pound fish up shallow and finally made a move out deeper.  Right decision! We got into some really good fish and I finally broke my PB with a 43 incher (and tied my fiancee so she cant hold it over me now... hahaha).  Got most of our fish on jerkbaits, a few swimming a grub as well.  A grub is an awesome ""follow up"" style bait and I always chuck it after getting a follower that wont commit.  It put a few good ones in the net for me today! Off the water by 11am, back home to Barrie, shower, dressed, off to the weddingin Mississauga.  Awesome night, maybe too awesome for our 5:00am wake-up.  Stayed in Mississuga, up at 6:00, a later than we'd hoped, but earlier than expected haha. Got home, boat hooked up, and back to the water.  Fishing was a lot tougher with the sun, but managed 3 pike, 2 small and one decent one.  Going to bed now I think.  Enjoy      "

467017,MCTFisher9120,2010-05-16 23:11:00,3761,"Haha, Rick nailed a nice Pike last night when we were out. We had the follows also, will definitely try to throw in a grub/jig after a miss/follow.  Looks like a nice area you were in man and wow congrads on the catches!  Thanks for sharing, MTBF"
467018,buick14,2010-05-16 23:15:00,741,"lol that boathouse there looks very familiar....  awesome outing man, way to take advantage when these bad boys are willing biters .....I'll have mine this weekend I hope  Nice report dude, awesome fish!"

467025,rock34,2010-05-16 23:48:00,215,Nice post man. Beauty fish
467048,Cudz,2010-05-17 01:27:00,2652,Good fish.  I got out for some pike but the biggest I caught was 3.4 pounds.  Pathetic.  I did weigh it because we had a two team tourney going on.  Here is the kicker.  That was the biggest pike of the day. lol
467064,asdve23rveavwa,2010-05-17 02:11:00,2690,"Some awesome pike, Steve!!!!1  Nicely done!"
467065,corvette1,2010-05-17 02:15:00,1765,congrats steve awesome gators
467112,steverowbotham,2010-05-17 11:13:00,1800,"thanks all, it was a very enjoyable weekend"
467114,solopaddler,2010-05-17 11:33:00,8605,Now that's a solid pike! Nice job man.
467369,Guest Johnny Bass,2010-05-17 23:42:00,0,Now that's a nice pike. So far the biggest I caught was 2 lbs this year! Just out of curiosity. I know you catch alot of big pike. How much do you think that one weighed?
467405,Moosebunk,2010-05-18 01:23:00,3970,Good job Steve.  Some nice ones in the mix.
467419,fishnsled,2010-05-18 01:48:00,3520,Some chunky fish = a sweet day on the water.
467451,The Urban Fisherman,2010-05-18 02:56:00,2050,"man those gators would eat my bluegills for an appetizer! haha good job as always dude!  cheers, Ryan"
467481,steverowbotham,2010-05-18 10:59:00,1800," Really hard to say.  I didnt weigh it, and i'm so used to judging bass weight.  I remember thinking holy crap this is heavier than I expected.  Could be as low as 15, as high as 22 maybe.  I would guess around 17 or 18, but again, no clue."
467507,BillsTheBassMan,2010-05-18 13:31:00,932,"Sounds like a busy, but amazing weekend.  Nice Fish Steve!  Hopefully I get into some like that in the Cooch this weekend."
467671,msp,2010-05-19 01:20:00,1336,Nice job on the pike Steve. Im going to kid nap you and make you take me there !!!! Did most of the big fish move deep already ?
467748,steverowbotham,2010-05-19 11:06:00,1800, Our better fish were in 8-14 ft.
467753,WeedLine,2010-05-19 11:42:00,322,Great job Steve. Those are some good pike.
467986,jaydub,2010-05-20 00:20:00,145,Nicely done Steve.    Sounds like an action packed weekend!! I wish I could say our first day out for pike was as successful.  We got only 3 pike in 6 hours with 4 guys in 2 boats...ouch (a few accidental buckets broke up the morning though).  Cudz wins the two team tourney with his first pike with about 5 minutes left.  Hopefully things go better this weekend!
