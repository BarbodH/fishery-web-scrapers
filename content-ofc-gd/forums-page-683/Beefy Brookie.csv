467638,silverstreak,2010-05-19 00:14:00,146,Not a monster but still a good size Brookie for the streams that I fish. Fish measured in at a whopping 11.5 inches and was one of my largest to date. Fish hit a #1 Copper spinner with a Single Barbless hook. Like all the others he was released to fight another day Cheers.

467937,walleye_man,2010-05-19 22:13:00,135,beautiful fish man congrats
467940,bare foot wader,2010-05-19 22:48:00,1354,"beauty fish...and beauty spinner, store bought or is that one you've made yourself? barbless or just single hook?  how do you find your hookup ratio with the single hook?  I've started making my own spinners, all single barbless hook (in BC) and I'd say my hookup ratio is very close to a barbed treble, maybe a tiny bit less...BUT less lost fish...I think you get a better hook placement running the single"
467973,silverstreak,2010-05-19 23:56:00,146,"Thanks for all the kind words Fella's. Streams are running very low and clear so if you are heading out MJL and others best keep a low profile. As for the Single hook spinners Barefoot, I absolutley love them especially for Steelhead.Hooking and Landiding ratio I find to be close to 100 percent. Great thing about the Single hooks is that they do far less damage to fish not to mention they hang up far less then traditonal trebles. Fish above hit a Riverwood Spinner found in some of the Tackle stores here in Southern Ontario. Have a safe and enjoyable weekend and looking forward to seeing some of your Brookie Pic's next week. Peace."
