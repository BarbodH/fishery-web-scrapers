467684,radar,2010-05-19 01:50:00,138,Is there anyplace near MArkham/Pickering area where I can get one of these tow boards? I don't mind a drive if necessary.      The key is the rope is tied to the board. Then there are 2 handle ropes for them to hold.   I am also looking to find a skiing tow bar in my 16'Springbok. Any suggestions where to look? Google has let me down.  Thanls
